<span id="ix.cclii-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.cclii-p1.1"></span>Letter CCLI. <span
id="fr_3095"></span>[3096](#fn_3095.md) </span>

<span id="ix.cclii-p3"></span>*To the people of Evæsæ.* <span
id="fr_3096"></span>[3097](#fn_3096.md)

<span id="ix.cclii-p5"></span>1.  <span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cclii-p5.1"></span>My</span> occupations are very numerous, and
my mind is full of many anxious cares, but I have never forgotten you,
my dear friends, ever praying my God for your constancy in the faith,
wherein ye stand and have your boasting in the hope of the glory of
God.  Truly nowadays it is hard to find, and extraordinary to see, a
Church pure, unharmed by the troubles of the times, and preserving the
apostolic doctrine in all its integrity and completeness.  Such is your
Church shewn at this present time by Him who in every generation makes
manifest them that are worthy of His calling.  May the Lord grant to you
the blessings of Jerusalem which is above, in return for your flinging
back at the heads of the liars their slanders against me, and your
refusal to allow them entry into your hearts.  I know, and am persuaded
in the Lord, that “your reward is great in heaven,” <span
id="fr_3097"></span>[3098](#fn_3097.md) even on account of this very
conduct.  For you have wisely concluded among yourselves, as indeed is
the truth, that the men who are “rewarding me evil for good, and hatred
for my love,” <span id="fr_3098"></span>[3099](#fn_3098.md) are accusing me
now for the very same points which they are found to have themselves
confessed and subscribed.

<span id="ix.cclii-p8"></span>2.  Their presenting you with their own
signatures for an accusation against me is not the only contradiction
into which they have fallen.  They were unanimously deposed by the
bishops assembled at Constantinople. <span
id="fr_3099"></span>[3100](#fn_3099.md)   They refused to accept this
deposition and appealed to a synod of impious men, <span
id="fr_3100"></span>[3101](#fn_3100.md) refusing to admit the episcopacy of
their judges, in order not to accept the sentence passed upon them.

<span id="ix.cclii-p11"></span>The reason alleged for their
non-recognition was their being leaders of wicked heresy.  All
this <span id="fr_3101"></span>[3102](#fn_3101.md) happened nearly
seventeen years ago.  The principal men of those who deposed them were
Eudoxius, Euippius, George, <span id="fr_3102"></span>[3103](#fn_3102.md)
Acacius, and others unknown to you. <span
id="fr_3103"></span>[3104](#fn_3103.md)

<span id="ix.cclii-p15"></span>The present tyrants of the churches are
their successors, some ordained to fill their places, and others
actually promoted by them.

<span id="ix.cclii-p16"></span>3.  Now let those who charge me with
unsound doctrine tell me in what way the men whose deposition they
refused to accept were heretical.  Let them tell me in what way those
promoted by them, and holding the same views as their fathers, are
orthodox.  If Euippius was orthodox, how can Eustathius, whom he
deposed, be other than a layman?  If Euippius was a heretic, how can any
one ordained by him be in communion with Eustathius now?  But all this
conduct, this trying to accuse men and set them up again, is child’s
play, got up against the Churches of God, for their own gain.

<span id="ix.cclii-p17"></span>When Eustathius was travelling through
Paphlagonia, he overthrew the altars <span
id="fr_3104"></span>[3105](#fn_3104.md) of Basilides of Paphlagonia, <span
id="fr_3105"></span>[3106](#fn_3105.md) and used to perform divine service
on his own tables. <span id="fr_3106"></span>[3107](#fn_3106.md)   Now he
is begging Basilides to be admitted to communion.  He refused to
communicate with our reverend brother Elpidius, because of his alliance
with the Amasenes; <span id="fr_3107"></span>[3108](#fn_3107.md) and now he
comes as a suppliant to the Amasenes, petitioning for alliance with
them.  Even ye yourselves know how shocking were his public utterances
against Euippius:  now he glorifies the holders of Euippius’s opinions
for their orthodoxy, if only they will cooperate in promoting his
restitution.  And I am all the while being calumniated, not because I am
doing any wrong, but because they have imagined that they will thus be
recommended to the party at Antioch.  The character of those whom they
sent for last year from Galatia, as being likely by their means to
recover the free exercise of their episcopal powers, is only too well
known to all who have lived even for a short time with them.  I pray
that the Lord may never allow me leisure to recount all their
proceedings.  I will only say that they have passed through the whole
country, with the honour and attendance of bishops, escorted by their
most honourable bodyguard and sympathizers; and have made a grand entry
into the city, and held an assembly with all authority.  The people have
been given over to them.  The altar has been given over to them.  How
they went to Nicopolis, and could do nothing there of all that they had
promised, and how they came, and what appearance they presented on their
return, is known to those who were on the spot.  They are obviously
taking every single step for their own <span id="page_292">p. 292</span>
<span id="ix.cclii-Page_292"></span>gain and profit.  If they say that
they have repented, let them shew their repentance in writing; let them
anathematize the Creed of Constantinople; let them separate from the
heretics; and let them no longer trick the simple-minded.  So much for
them and theirs.

<span id="ix.cclii-p22"></span>4.  I, however, brethren beloved, small
and insignificant as I am, but remaining ever by God’s grace the same,
have never changed with the changes of the world.  My creed has not
varied at Seleucia, at Constantinople, at Zela, <span
id="fr_3108"></span>[3109](#fn_3108.md) at Lampsacus, and at Rome.  My
present creed is not different from the former; it has remained ever one
and the same.  As we received from the Lord, so are we baptized; as we
are baptized, so we make profession of our faith; as we make profession
of our faith, so do we offer our doxology, not separating the Holy Ghost
from Father and Son, nor preferring Him in honour to the Father, or
asserting Him to be prior to the Son, as blasphemers’ tongues
invent. <span id="fr_3109"></span>[3110](#fn_3109.md)   Who could be so
rash as to reject the Lord’s commandment, and boldly devise an order of
his own for the Names?  But I do not call the Spirit, Who is ranked with
Father and Son, a creature.  I do not dare to call slavish that which is
royal. <span id="fr_3110"></span>[3111](#fn_3110.md)   And I beseech you to
remember the threat uttered by the Lord in the words, “All manner of sin
and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men; but the blasphemy against the
Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men, neither in this world,
neither in the world to come.” <span
id="fr_3111"></span>[3112](#fn_3111.md)   Keep yourselves from dangerous
teaching against the Spirit.  “Stand fast in the faith.” <span
id="fr_3112"></span>[3113](#fn_3112.md)   Look over all the world, and see
how small the part is which is unsound.  All the rest of the Church
which has received the Gospel. from one end of the world to the other,
abides in this sound and unperverted doctrine.  From their communion I
pray that I may never fall, and I pray that I may have part and lot with
you in the righteous day of our Lord Jesus Christ, when He shall come to
give to every one according to his conduct.
