<span id="ix.lxi-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.lxi-p1.1"></span>Letter LX. <span
id="fr_2220"></span>[2221](#fn_2220.md) </span>

<span id="ix.lxi-p3"></span>*To Gregory his uncle*.

<span id="ix.lxi-p4"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.lxi-p4.1"></span>Formerly</span> I was glad to see my brother. 
Why not, since he is my brother and such a brother?  Now I have received
him on his coming to visit me with the same feelings, and have lost none
of my affection.  God forbid that I should ever so feel as to forget the
ties of nature and be at war with those who are near and dear to me.  I
have found his presence a comfort in my bodily sickness and the other
troubles of my soul, and I have been especially delighted at the letter
which he has brought me from your excellency.  For a long time I have
been hoping that it would come, for this only reason, that I need not
add to my life any doleful episode of quarrel between kith and kin, sure
to give pleasure to foes and sorrow to friends, and to be displeasing to
God, Who has laid down perfect love as the distinctive characteristic of
His disciples.  So I reply, as I am indeed bound, with an earnest
request for your prayers for me, and your care for me in all things, as
your relative.  Since I, from want of information, cannot clearly
understand the meaning of what is going on, I have judged it right to
accept the truth of the account which you are so good as to give me.  It
is for you of your wisdom to settle the rest, our meeting with one
another, the fitting time and a convenient place.  If your reverence
really does not disdain to come down to my lowliness and to have speech
with me, whether you wish the interview to take place in the presence of
others or in private, I shall make no objection, for I have once for all
made up my mind to submit to you in love, and to carry out, without
exception, what your reverence enjoins on me for the glory of God.

<span id="ix.lxi-p5"></span>I have not laid my reverend brother under
the necessity of reporting anything to you by word of mouth, because on
the former occasion what he said was not borne out by facts.
