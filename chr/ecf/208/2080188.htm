<p class="endnote"><a name="ix.cxvi-p4"></A> The Ben. E. note that in the imperial codex No. lxvii. appears an argument of this letter wanting in the editions of St. Basil.&#160; It is as follows: &#160;&#8220;Letter of the same to Simplicia about her eunuchs.&#160; She was a heretic.&#160; The blessed Basil being ill and entering a bath to bathe, Simplicia told her eunuchs and maids to throw his towels out.&#160; Straightway the just judgment of God slew some of them, and Simplicia sent money to the blessed Basil to make amends for the injury.&#160; Basil refused to receive it, and wrote this Letter.&#8221;&#160; This extraordinary preface seems to have been written by some annotator ignorant of the circumstances, which may be learnt from Greg. Naz. <i>Letter</i> xxxviii.&#160; It appears that a certain Cappadocian church, long without a bishop, had elected a slave of Simplicia, a lady wealthy and munificent, but of suspected orthodoxy.&#160; Basil and Gregory injudiciously ordained the reluctant slave without waiting for his mistress&#146;s consent.&#160; The angry lady wrote in indignation, and threatened him with the vengeance of her slaves and eunuchs.&#160; After Basil&#146;s death she returned to the charge, and pressed Gregory to get the ordination annulled.&#160; <i>cf</i>. Maran, <i>Vit. Bas</i>. chap. xxv.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="ix.cxvi-p6"></A> Presumably the slaves and eunuchs mentioned below.&#160; If the letter is genuine it is wholly unworthy of the Archbishop of C&aelig;sarea.</p>
