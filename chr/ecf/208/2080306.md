<span id="ix.ccxxxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.ccxxxiv-p1.1"></span>Letter CCXXXIII. <span
id="fr_2949"></span>[2950](#fn_2949) </span>

<span id="ix.ccxxxiv-p3"></span>To Amphilochius, in reply to certain
questions.

<span id="ix.ccxxxiv-p4"></span>I.  <span class="c14"><span
id="ix.ccxxxiv-p4.1"></span>I know</span> that I have myself heard of
this, and I am aware of the constitution of mankind.  What shall I say? 
The mind is a wonderful thing, and therein we possess that which is
after the image of the Creator.  And the operation of the mind is
wonderful; in that, in its perpetual motion, it frequently forms
imaginations about things non-existent as though they were existent, and
is frequently carried straight to the truth.  But there are in it two
faculties; in accordance with the view of us who believe in God, the one
evil, that of the dæmons which draws us on to their own apostasy; and
the divine and the good, which brings us to the likeness of God.  When,
therefore, the mind remains alone and unaided, it contemplates small
things, commensurate with itself.  When it yields to those who deceive
it, it nullifies its proper judgment, and is concerned with monstrous
fancies.  Then it considers wood to be no longer wood, but a god; then
it looks on gold no longer as money, but as an object of worship. <span
id="fr_2950"></span>[2951](#fn_2950)   If on the other hand it assents
to its diviner part, and accepts the boons of the Spirit, then, so far
as its nature admits, it becomes perceptive of the divine.  There are,
as it were, three conditions of life, and three operations of the mind. 
Our ways may be wicked, and the movements of our mind wicked; such as
adulteries, thefts, idolatries, slanders, strife, passion, sedition,
vain-glory, and all that the apostle Paul enumerates among the works of
the flesh. <span id="fr_2951"></span>[2952](#fn_2951)   Or the soul’s
operation is, as it were, in a mean, and has nothing about it either
damnable or laudable, as the perception of such mechanical crafts as we
commonly speak of as indifferent, and, of their own character, inclining
neither towards virtue nor towards vice.  For what vice is there in the
craft of the helmsman or the physician?  Neither are these operations in
themselves virtues, but they incline in one direction or the other in
accordance with the will of those who use them.  But the mind which is
impregnated with the Godhead of the Spirit is at once capable of viewing
great objects; it beholds the divine beauty, though only so far as grace
imparts and its nature receives.

<span id="ix.ccxxxiv-p7"></span>2.  Let them dismiss, therefore, these
questions of dialectics and examine the truth, not with mischievous
exactness but with reverence.  The judgment of our mind is given us for
the understanding of the truth.  Now our God is the very truth. <span
id="fr_2952"></span>[2953](#fn_2952)   So the primary function of our
mind is to know one God, but to know Him so far as the infinitely great
can be known by the very small.  When our eyes are first brought to the
perception of visible objects, all visible objects are not at once
brought into sight.  The hemisphere of heaven is not beheld with one
glance, but we are surrounded by a certain appearance, though in reality
many things, not to say all things, in it are unperceived;—the nature of
the stars, their greatness, their distances, their movements, their
conjunctions, their intervals, their other conditions, the actual
essence of the firmament, the distance of depth from the concave
circumference to the convex surface.  Nevertheless, no one would allege
the heaven to be invisible because of what is unknown; it would be said
to be visible on account of our limited perception of it.  It is just
the same in the case of God.  If the mind has been injured by devils it
will be guilty of idolatry, or will be perverted to some other form of
impiety.  But if it has yielded to the aid of the Spirit, it will have
understanding of the truth, and will know God.  But it will know Him, as
the Apostle says, in part; and in the life to come more perfectly.  For
“when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be
done away.” <span id="fr_2953"></span>[2954](#fn_2953)   The judgment of
the mind is, therefore, good and given us for a good end—the perception
of God; but it operates only so far as it can.
