<span id="ix.xcviii-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.xcviii-p1.1"></span>Letter XCVII. <span
id="fr_2339"></span>[2340](#fn_2339) </span>

<span id="ix.xcviii-p3"></span>*To the Senate of Tyana*. <span
id="fr_2340"></span>[2341](#fn_2340)

<span id="ix.xcviii-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.xcviii-p5.1"></span>The</span> Lord, Who reveals hidden things,
and makes manifest the counsels of men’s hearts, has given even to the
lowly knowledge of devices apparently hard to be understood.  Nothing
has escaped my notice, nor has any single action been unknown. 
Nevertheless I neither see nor hear anything but the peace of God and
all that pertains to it.  Others may be great and powerful and
self-confident, but I am nothing and worth nothing, and so I could never
take upon myself so much as to think myself able to manage matters
without support.  I know perfectly well that I stand more in need of the
succour of each of the brethren than one hand does of the other.  Truly,
from our own bodily constitution, the Lord has taught us the necessity
of fellowship.  When I look to these my limbs and see that no out of
them is self-sufficient, how can I reckon myself competent to discharge
the duties of life?  One foot could not walk securely without the
support of the other; one eye could not see well, were it not for the
alliance of the other and for its being able to look at objects in
conjunction with it.  Hearing is more exact when sound is received
through both channels, and the grasp is made firmer by the fellowship of
the fingers.  In a word, of all that is done by nature and by the will,
I see nothing done without the concord of fellow forces.  Even prayer,
when it is not united prayer, loses its natural strength and the Lord
has told us that He will be in the midst where two or three call on Him
in concord.  The Lord Himself undertook the economy, <span
id="fr_2341"></span>[2342](#fn_2341) that by the blood of His cross He
might make peace between things in earth and things in heaven.  For all
these reasons then, I pray that I may for my remaining days remain in
peace; in peace I ask that it may be my lot to fall asleep.  For peace’s
sake there is no trouble that I will not undertake, no act, no word of
humility, that I will shrink from; I will reckon no length of journey, I
will undergo any inconvenience, if only I may be rewarded by being able
to make peace.  If I am followed by any one in this direction, it is
well, and my prayers are answered; <span id="page_182">p. 182</span>
<span id="ix.xcviii-Page_182"></span>but if the result is different I
shall not recede from my determination.  Every one will receive the
fruit of his own works in the day of retribution.
