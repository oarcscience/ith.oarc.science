<span id="ix.civ-p3"></span>* To the people of Satala*.

<span id="ix.civ-p4"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.civ-p4.1"></span>The</span> Lord has answered the prayer of His
people and has given them, by my humble instrumentality, a shepherd
worthy of the name; not one making traffic of the word, as many do, but
competent to give full satisfaction to you, who love orthodoxy of
doctrine, and have accepted a life agreeable to the Lord’s commands, in
the name of the Lord, Who has filled him with His own spiritual graces.
