<span id="ix.lxxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.lxxvii-p1.1"></span>Letter LXXVI. <span
id="fr_2267"></span>[2268](#fn_2267.md) </span>

<span id="ix.lxxvii-p3"></span>*To Sophronius the Master*. <span
id="fr_2268"></span>[2269](#fn_2268.md)

<span id="ix.lxxvii-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.lxxvii-p5.1"></span>The</span> greatness of the calamities, which
have befallen our native city, did seem likely to compel me to travel in
person to the court, and there to relate, both to your excellency and to
all those who are most influential in affairs, the dejected state in
which Cæsarea is lying.  But I am kept here alike by ill-health and by
the care of the Churches.  In the meantime, therefore, I hasten to tell
your lordship our troubles by letter, and to acquaint you that never
ship, drowned in sea by furious winds, so suddenly disappeared, never
city shattered by earthquake or overwhelmed by flood, so swiftly
vanished out of sight, as our city, engulfed by this new constitution,
has gone utterly to ruin.  Our misfortunes have passed into a tale.  Our
institutions are a thing of the past; and all <span id="page_171">p.
171</span> <span id="ix.lxxvii-Page_171"></span>our men of high civil
rank, in despair at what has happened to our magistrates, have left
their homes in the city and are wandering about the country.  There is a
break therefore in the necessary conduct of affairs, and the city, which
ere now gloried both in men of learning and in others who abound in
opulent towns, has become a most unseemly spectacle.  One only
consolation have we left in our troubles, and that is to groan over our
misfortunes to your excellency and to implore you, if you can, to reach
out the helping hand to Cæsarea who falls on her knees before you.  How
indeed you may be able to aid us I am not myself able to explain; but I
am sure that to you, with all your intelligence, it will be easy to
discover the means, and not difficult, through the power given you by
God, to use them when they are found.
