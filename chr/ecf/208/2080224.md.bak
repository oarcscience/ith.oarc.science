id="ix.clii-p1.1"></span>Letter CLI. <span
id="fr_2498"></span>[2499](#fn_2498.md) </span>

<span id="ix.clii-p3"></span>*To Eustathius the Physician*. <span
id="fr_2499"></span>[2500](#fn_2499.md)

<span id="ix.clii-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.clii-p5.1"></span>If</span> my letters are of any good, lose no
time in writing to me and in rousing me to write.  We are unquestionably
made more cheerful when we read the letters of wise men who love the
Lord.  It is for you to say, who read it, whether you find anything
worth attention in what I write.  Were it not for the multitude of my
engagements, I should not debar myself from the pleasure of writing
frequently.  Pray do you, whose cares are fewer, soothe me by your
letters.  Wells, it is said, are the better for being used.  The
exhortations which you derive from your profession are apparently beside
the point, for it is not I who am applying the knife; it is men whose
day is done, who are falling upon themselves. <span
id="fr_2500"></span>[2501](#fn_2500.md)   The phrase of the Stoics runs,
“since things do not happen as we like, we like what happens;” but I
cannot make my mind fall in with what is happening.  That some men
should do what they do not like because they cannot help it, I have no
objection.  You doctors do not cauterise a sick man, or make him suffer
pain in some other way, because you like it; but you often adopt this
treatment in obedience to the necessity of the case.  Mariners do not
willingly throw their cargo overboard; but in order to escape shipwreck
they put up with the loss, preferring a life of penury to death.  Be
sure that I look with sorrow and with many groans upon the separation of
those who are holding themselves aloof.  But yet I endure it.  To lovers
of the truth nothing can be put before God and hope in Him. <span

thrown overboard represent the loss of unity incurred by the Sebastenes
by leaving the communion of Eustathius for his own.  *cf. Letter*
