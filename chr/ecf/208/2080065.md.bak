<span id="viii.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="viii.iv-p1.1"></span>Homily III.</span>

<span id="viii.iv-p2"></span>On the Firmament.

<span id="viii.iv-p3"></span>1.  <span class="c14"><span
id="viii.iv-p3.1"></span>We</span> have now recounted the works of the
first day, or rather of one day.  Far be it from me indeed, to take from
it the privilege it enjoys of having been for the Creator a day apart, a
day which is not counted in the same order as the others.  Our
discussion yesterday treated of the works of this day, and divided the
narrative so as to give you food for your souls in the morning, and joy
in the evening.  To-day we pass on to the wonders of the second day. 
And here I do not wish to speak of the narrator’s talent, but of the
grace of Scripture, for the narrative is so naturally told that it
pleases and delights all the friends of truth.  It is this charm of
truth which the Psalmist expresses so emphatically when he says, “How
sweet are thy words unto my taste, yea, sweeter than honey to my
mouth.” <span id="fr_1457"></span>[1458](#fn_1457.md)   Yesterday then, as
far as we were able, we delighted our souls by conversing about the
oracles of God, and now to-day we are met together again on the second
day to contemplate the wonders of the second day.

<span id="viii.iv-p5"></span>I know that many artisans, belonging to
mechanical trades, are crowding around me.  A day’s labour hardly
suffices to maintain them; therefore I am compelled to abridge my
discourse, so as not to keep them too long from their work.  What shall
I say to them?  The time which you lend to God is not lost:  he will
return it to you with large interest.  Whatever difficulties may trouble
you the Lord will disperse them.  To those who have preferred spiritual
welfare, He will give health of body, keenness of mind, success in
business, and unbroken prosperity.  And, even if in this life our
efforts should not realise our hopes, the teachings of the Holy Spirit
are none the less a rich treasure for the ages to come.  Deliver your
heart, then, from the cares of this life and give close heed to my
words.  Of what avail will it be to you if you are here in the body, and
your heart is anxious about your earthly treasure?

<span id="viii.iv-p6"></span>2.  And God said “Let there be a firmament
in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the
waters.” <span id="fr_1458"></span>[1459](#fn_1458.md)   Yesterday we heard
God’s decree, “Let there be light.”  To-day it is, “Let there be a
firmament.”  There appears to be something more in this.  The word is
not limited to a simple command.  It lays down the reason necessitating
the structure of the firmament:  it is, it is said, to separate the
waters from the waters.  And first let us ask how God speaks?  Is it in
our manner?  Does His intelligence receive an impression from objects,
and, after having conceived them, make them known by particular signs
appropriate to each of them?  Has He consequently recourse to the organs
of voice to convey His thoughts?  Is He obliged to strike the air by the
articulate movements of the voice, to unveil the thought hidden in His
heart?  Would it not seem like an idle fable to say that God should need
such a circuitous method to manifest His thoughts?  And is it not more
conformable with true religion to say, that the divine will and the
first impetus of divine intelligence are the Word of God?  It is He whom
Scripture vaguely represents, to show us that God has not only <span
id="page_66">p. 66</span> <span id="viii.iv-Page_66"></span>wished to
create the world, but to create it with the help of a co-operator. 
Scripture might continue the history as it is begun:  In the beginning
God created the heaven and the earth; afterwards He created light, then
He created the firmament.  But, by making God command and speak, the
Scripture tacitly shows us Him to Whom this order and these words are
addressed. <span id="fr_1459"></span>[1460](#fn_1459.md)   It is not that
it grudges us the knowledge of the truth, but that it may kindle our
desire by showing us some trace and indication of the mystery.  We seize
with delight, and carefully keep, the fruit of laborious efforts, whilst
a possession easily attained is despised. <span
id="fr_1460"></span>[1461](#fn_1460.md)   Such is the road and the course
which Scripture follows to lead us to the idea of the Only begotten. 
And certainly, God’s immaterial nature had no need of the material
language of voice, since His very thoughts could be transmitted to His
fellow-worker.  What need then of speech, for those Who by thought alone
could communicate their counsels to each other?  Voice was made for
hearing, and hearing for voice.  Where there is neither air, nor tongue,
nor ear, nor that winding canal which carries sounds to the seat of
sensation in the head, there is no need for words:  thoughts of the soul
are sufficient to transmit the will.  As I said then, this language is
only a wise and ingenious contrivance to set our minds seeking the
Person to whom the words are addressed.

<span id="viii.iv-p12"></span>3.  In the second place, does the
firmament that is called heaven differ from the firmament that God made
in the beginning?  Are there two heavens?  The philosophers, who discuss
heaven, would rather lose their tongues than grant this.  There is only
one heaven, <span id="fr_1461"></span>[1462](#fn_1461.md) they pretend; and
it is of a nature neither to admit of a second, nor of a third, nor of
several others.  The essence of the celestial body quite complete
constitutes its vast unity.  Because, they say, every body which has a
circular motion is one and finite.  And if this body is used in the
construction of the first heaven, there will be nothing left for the
creation of a second or a third.  Here we see what those imagine who put
under the Creator’s hand uncreated matter; a lie that follows from the
first fable.  But we ask the Greek sages not to mock us before they are
agreed among themselves.  Because there are among them some who say
there are infinite heavens and worlds. <span
id="fr_1462"></span>[1463](#fn_1462.md)   When grave demonstrations shall
have upset their foolish system, when the laws of geometry shall have
established that, according to the nature of heaven, it is impossible
that there should be two, we shall only laugh the more at this elaborate
scientific trifling.  These learned men see not merely one bubble but
several bubbles formed by the same cause, and they doubt the power of
creative wisdom to bring several heavens into being!  We find, however,
if we raise our eyes towards the omnipotence of God, that the strength
and grandeur of the heavens differ from the drops of water bubbling on
the surface of a fountain.  How ridiculous, then, is their argument of
impossibility!  As for myself, far from not believing in a second, I
seek for the third whereon the blessed Paul was found worthy to
gaze. <span id="fr_1463"></span>[1464](#fn_1463.md)   And does not the
Psalmist in saying “heaven of heavens” <span
id="fr_1464"></span>[1465](#fn_1464.md) give us an idea of their
plurality?  Is the plurality of heaven stranger than the seven circles
through which nearly all the philosophers agree that the seven planets
pass,—circles which they represent to us as placed in connection with
each other like casks fitting the one into the other?  These circles,
they say, carried away in a direction contrary to that of the world, and
striking the æther, make sweet and harmonious sounds, unequalled by the
sweetest melody. <span id="fr_1465"></span>[1466](#fn_1465.md)   And if we
ask them for the wit<span id="page_67">p. 67</span> <span
id="viii.iv-Page_67"></span>ness of the senses, what do they say?  That
we, accustomed to this noise from our birth, on account of hearing it
always, have lost the sense of it; like men in smithies with their ears
incessantly dinned.  If I refuted this ingenious frivolity, the untruth
of which is evident from the first word, it would seem as though I did
not know the value of time, and mistrusted the intelligence of such an
audience.

<span id="viii.iv-p32"></span>But let me leave the vanity of outsiders
to those who are without, and return to the theme proper to the Church. 
If we believe some of those who have preceded us, we have not here the
creation of a new heaven, but a new account of the first.  The reason
they give is, that the earlier narrative briefly described the creation
of heaven and earth; while here scripture relates in greater detail the
manner in which each was created.  I, however, since Scripture gives to
this second heaven another name and its own function, maintain that it
is different from the heaven which was made at the beginning; that it is
of a stronger nature and of an especial use to the universe.

<span id="viii.iv-p33"></span>4.  “*And God said, let there be a
firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from
the waters.  And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which
were under the firmament from the waters which were above the
firmament*.” <span id="fr_1466"></span>[1467](#fn_1466.md)   Before laying
hold of the meaning of Scripture let us try to meet objections from
other quarters.  We are asked how, if the firmament is a spherical body,
as it appears to the eye, its convex circumference can contain the water
which flows and circulates in higher regions?  What shall we answer? 
One thing only:  because the interior of a body presents a perfect
concavity it does not necessarily follow that its exterior surface is
spherical and smoothly rounded.  Look at the stone vaults of baths, and
the structure of buildings of cave form; the dome, which forms the
interior, does not prevent the roof from having ordinarily a flat
surface.  Let these unfortunate men cease, then, from tormenting us and
themselves about the impossibility of our retaining water in the higher
regions.

<span id="viii.iv-p35"></span>Now we must say something about the nature
of the firmament, and why it received the order to hold the middle place
between the waters.  Scripture constantly makes use of the word
firmament to express extraordinary strength.  “The Lord my firmament and
refuge.” <span id="fr_1467"></span>[1468](#fn_1467.md)   “I have
strengthened the pillars of it.” <span
id="fr_1468"></span>[1469](#fn_1468.md)   “Praise him in the firmament of
his power.” <span id="fr_1469"></span>[1470](#fn_1469.md)   The heathen
writers thus call a strong body one which is compact and full, <span
id="fr_1470"></span>[1471](#fn_1470.md) to distinguish it from the
mathematical body.  A mathematical body is a body which exists only in
the three dimensions, breadth, depth, and height.  A firm body, on the
contrary, adds resistance to the dimensions.  It is the custom of
Scripture to call firmament all that is strong and unyielding.  It even
uses the word to denote the condensation of the air: He, it says, who
strengthens the thunder. <span id="fr_1471"></span>[1472](#fn_1471.md)  
Scripture means by the strengthening of the thunder, the strength and
resistance of the wind, which, enclosed in the hollows of the clouds,
produces the noise of thunder when it breaks through with
violence. <span id="fr_1472"></span>[1473](#fn_1472.md)   Here then,
according to me, is a firm substance, capable of retaining the fluid and
unstable element water; and as, according to the common acceptation, it
appears that the firmament owes its origin to water, we must not believe
that it resembles frozen water or any other matter produced by the
filtration of water; as, for example, rock crystal, which is said to owe
its metamorphosis to excessive congelation, <span
id="fr_1473"></span>[1474](#fn_1473.md) or the transparent stone <span
id="fr_1474"></span>[1475](#fn_1474.md) which forms in mines. <span
id="fr_1475"></span>[1476](#fn_1475.md)   This pellucid stone, if one finds
it in its natural perfection, without cracks inside, or the least spot
of corruption, almost rivals the air in clearness.  We cannot compare
the firmament to one of these substances.  To hold such an opinion about
celestial bodies would be childish and foolish; and although everything
may be in everything, fire in earth, air in water, and of the other
elements the one in the other; although none of those which come under
our senses are pure and without mixture, either with the element which
serves as a medium for it, or with that which is contrary to it; I,
nevertheless, dare not affirm that the firmament was formed of one of
these simple substances, or of a mixture of them, for I am taught by
Scripture not to allow my imagination to wander too far afield.  But do
not <span id="page_68">p. 68</span> <span
id="viii.iv-Page_68"></span>let us forget to remark that, after these
divine words “let there be a firmament,” it is not said “and the
firmament was made” but, “and God made the firmament, and divided the
waters.” <span id="fr_1476"></span>[1477](#fn_1476.md)   Hear, O ye deaf! 
See, O ye blind!—who, then, is deaf?  He who does not hear this
startling voice of the Holy Spirit.  Who is blind?  He who does not see
such clear proofs of the Only begotten. <span
id="fr_1477"></span>[1478](#fn_1477.md)   “Let there be a firmament.”  It
is the voice of the primary and principal Cause.  “And God made the
firmament.”  Here is a witness to the active and creative power of God.

<span id="viii.iv-p47"></span>5.  But let us continue our explanation: 
“*Let it divide the waters from the waters*.” <span
id="fr_1478"></span>[1479](#fn_1478.md)   The mass of waters, which from
all directions flowed over the earth, and was suspended in the air, was
infinite, so that there was no proportion between it and the other
elements.  Thus, as it has been already said, the abyss covered the
earth.  We give the reason for this abundance of water.  None of you
assuredly will attack our opinion; not even those who have the most
cultivated minds, and whose piercing eye can penetrate this perishable
and fleeting nature; you will not accuse me of advancing impossible or
imaginary theories, nor will you ask me upon what foundation the fluid
element rests.  By the same reason which makes them attract the earth,
heavier than water, from the extremities of the world to suspend it in
the centre, they will grant us without doubt that it is due both to its
natural attraction downwards and its general equilibrium, that this
immense quantity of water rests motionless upon the earth. <span
id="fr_1479"></span>[1480](#fn_1479.md)   Therefore the prodigious mass of
waters was spread around the earth; not in proportion with it and
infinitely larger, thanks to the foresight of the supreme Artificer,
Who, from the beginning, foresaw what was to come, and at the first
provided all for the future needs of the world.  But what need was there
for this superabundance of water?  The essence of fire is necessary for
the world, not only in the economy of earthly produce, but for the
completion of the universe; for it would be imperfect <span
id="fr_1480"></span>[1481](#fn_1480.md) if the most powerful and the most
vital of its elements were lacking. <span
id="fr_1481"></span>[1482](#fn_1481.md)   Now fire and water are hostile to
and destructive of each other.  Fire, if it is the stronger, destroys
water, and water, if in greater abundance, destroys fire.  As,
therefore, it was necessary to avoid an open struggle between these
elements, so as not to bring about the dissolution of the universe by
the total disappearance of one or the other, the sovereign Disposer
created such a quantity of water that in spite of constant diminution
from the effects of fire, it could last until the time fixed for the
destruction of the world.  He who planned all with weight and measure,
He who, according to the word of Job, knows the number of the drops of
rain, <span id="fr_1482"></span>[1483](#fn_1482.md) knew how long His work
would last, and for how much consumption of fire He ought to allow. 
This is the reason of the abundance of water at the creation.  Further,
there is no one so strange to life as to need to learn the reason why
fire is essential to the world.  Not only all the arts which support
life, the art of weaving, that of shoemaking, of architecture, of
agriculture, have need of the help of fire, but the vegetation of trees,
the ripening of fruits, the breeding of land and water animals, and
their nourishment, all existed from heat from the beginning, and have
been since maintained by the action of heat.  The creation of heat was
then indispensable for the formation and the preservation of beings, and
the abundance of waters was no less so in the presence of the constant
and inevitable consumption by fire.

<span id="viii.iv-p53"></span>6.  Survey creation; you will see the
power of heat reigning over all that is born and perishes.  On account
of it comes all the water spread over the earth, as well as that which
is beyond our sight and is dispersed in the depths of the earth.  On
account of it are abundance of fountains, springs or wells, courses of
rivers, both mountain torrents and ever flowing streams, for the storing
of moisture in many and various reservoirs.  From the East, from the
winter solstice flows the Indus, the greatest river of the earth,
according to geographers.  From the middle of the East proceed the
Bactrus, <span id="fr_1483"></span>[1484](#fn_1483.md) the Choaspes, <span
id="fr_1484"></span>[1485](#fn_1484.md) and the Araxes, <span
id="fr_1485"></span>[1486](#fn_1485.md) from which the Tanais <span
id="fr_1486"></span>[1487](#fn_1486.md) detaches itself to fall into the
Palus-Mæotis. <span id="fr_1487"></span>[1488](#fn_1487.md)   Add to these
the Phasis <span id="fr_1488"></span>[1489](#fn_1488.md) which descends
from Mount Caucasus, and countless other rivers, which, from northern
regions, flow into the Euxine Sea.  From <span id="page_69">p. 69</span>
<span id="viii.iv-Page_69"></span>the warm countries of the West, from
the foot of the Pyrenees, arise the Tartessus <span
id="fr_1489"></span>[1490](#fn_1489.md) and the Ister, <span
id="fr_1490"></span>[1491](#fn_1490.md) of which the one discharges itself
into the sea beyond the Pillars and the other, after flowing through
Europe, falls into Euxine Sea.  Is there any need to enumerate those
which the Ripæan mountains <span id="fr_1491"></span>[1492](#fn_1491.md)
pour forth in the heart of Scythia, the Rhone, <span
id="fr_1492"></span>[1493](#fn_1492.md) and so many other rivers, all
navigable, which after having watered the countries of the western Gauls
and of Celts and of the neighbouring barbarians, flow into the Western
sea?  And others from the higher regions of the South flow through
Ethiopia, to discharge themselves some into our sea, others into
inaccessible seas, the Ægon <span id="fr_1493"></span>[1494](#fn_1493.md)
the Nyses, the Chremetes, <span id="fr_1494"></span>[1495](#fn_1494.md) and
above all the Nile, which is not of the character of a river when, like
a sea, it inundates Egypt.  Thus the habitable part of our earth is
surrounded by water, linked together by vast seas and irrigated by
countless perennial rivers, thanks to the ineffable wisdom of Him Who
ordered all to prevent this rival element to fire from being entirely
destroyed.

<span id="viii.iv-p66"></span>However, a time will come, when all shall
be consumed by fire; as Isaiah says of the God of the universe in these
words, “That saith to the deep, Be dry, and I will dry up thy
rivers.” <span id="fr_1495"></span>[1496](#fn_1495.md)   Reject then the
foolish wisdom of this world, <span id="fr_1496"></span>[1497](#fn_1496.md)
and receive with me the more simple but infallible doctrine of truth.

<span id="viii.iv-p69"></span>7.  Therefore we read:  “*Let there be a
firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from
the waters*.”  I have said what the word firmament in Scripture means. 
It is not in reality a firm and solid substance which has weight and
resistance; this name would otherwise have better suited the earth. 
But, as the substance of superincumbent bodies is light, without
consistency, and cannot be grasped by any one of our senses, it is in
comparison with these pure and imperceptible substances that the
firmament has received its name.  Imagine a place fit to divide the
moisture, sending it, if pure and filtered, into higher regions, and
making it fall, if it is dense and earthy; to the end that by the
gradual withdrawal of the moist particles the same temperature may be
preserved from the beginning to the end.  You do not believe in this
prodigious quantity of water; but you do not take into account the
prodigious quantity of heat, less considerable no doubt in bulk, but
exceedingly powerful nevertheless, if you consider it as destructive of
moisture.  It attracts surrounding moisture, as the melon shows us, and
consumes it as quickly when attracted, as the flame of the lamp draws to
it the fuel supplied by the wick and burns it up.  Who doubts that the
æther is an ardent fire? <span id="fr_1497"></span>[1498](#fn_1497.md)   If
an impassable limit had not been assigned to it by the Creator, what
would prevent it from setting on fire and consuming all that is near it,
and absorbing all the moisture from existing things?  The aerial waters
which veil the heavens with vapours that are sent forth by rivers,
fountains, marshes, lakes, and seas, prevent the æther from invading and
burning up the universe.  Thus we see even this sun, in the summer
season, dry up in a moment a damp and marshy country, and make it
perfectly arid.  What has become of all the water?  Let these masters of
omniscience tell us.  Is it not plain to every one that it has risen in
vapour, and has been consumed by the heat of the sun?  They say, none
the less, that even the sun is without heat.  What time they lose in
words!  And see what proof they lean upon to resist what is perfectly
plain.  Its colour is white, and neither reddish nor yellow.  It is not
then fiery by nature, and its heat results, they say, from the velocity
of its rotation. <span id="fr_1498"></span>[1499](#fn_1498.md)   What do
they gain?  That the sun does not seem to absorb moisture?  I do not,
however, reject this statement, although it is false, because it helps
my argument.  I said that the consumption of heat required this
prodigious quantity of water.  That the sun owes its heat to its nature,
or that heat results from its action, makes no difference, provided that
it produces the same effects upon the same matter.  If you kindle fire
by rubbing two pieces of wood together, or if you light them by holding
them to a flame, you will have absolutely the same effect.  Besides, we
see that the great wisdom of Him who governs all, makes the sun travel
<span id="page_70">p. 70</span> <span id="viii.iv-Page_70"></span>from
one region to another, for fear that, if it remained always in the same
place, its excessive heat would destroy the order of the universe.  Now
it passes into southern regions about the time of the winter solstice,
now it returns to the sign of the equinox; from thence it betakes itself
to northern regions during the summer solstice, and keeps up by this
imperceptible passage a pleasant temperature throughout all the world.

<span id="viii.iv-p72"></span>Let the learned people see if they do not
disagree among themselves.  The water which the sun consumes is, they
say, what prevents the sea from rising and flooding the rivers; the
warmth of the sun leaves behind the salts and the bitterness of the
waters, and absorbs from them the pure and drinkable particles, <span
id="fr_1499"></span>[1500](#fn_1499.md) thanks to the singular virtue of
this planet in attracting all that is light and in allowing to fall,
like mud and sediment, all which is thick and earthy.  From thence come
the bitterness, the salt taste and the power of withering and drying up
which are characteristic of the sea.  While as is notorious, they hold
these views, they shift their ground and say that moisture cannot be
lessened by the sun. <span id="fr_1500"></span>[1501](#fn_1500.md)

<span id="viii.iv-p75"></span>8.  “*And God called the firmament
heaven*.” <span id="fr_1501"></span>[1502](#fn_1501.md)   The nature of
right belongs to another, and the firmament only shares it on account of
its resemblance to heaven.  We often find the visible region called
heaven, on account of the density and continuity of the air within our
ken, and deriving its name “heaven” from the word which means to
see. <span id="fr_1502"></span>[1503](#fn_1502.md)   It is of it that
Scripture says, “The fowl of the air,” <span
id="fr_1503"></span>[1504](#fn_1503.md) “Fowl that may fly…in the open
firmament of heaven;” <span id="fr_1504"></span>[1505](#fn_1504.md) and,
elsewhere, “They mount up to heaven.” <span
id="fr_1505"></span>[1506](#fn_1505.md)   Moses, blessing the tribe of
Joseph, desires for it the fruits and the dews of heaven, of the suns of
summer and the conjunctions of the moon, and blessings from the tops of
the mountains and from the everlasting hills, <span
id="fr_1506"></span>[1507](#fn_1506.md) in one word, from all which
fertilises the earth.  In the curses on Israel it is said, “And thy
heaven that is over thy head shall be brass.” <span
id="fr_1507"></span>[1508](#fn_1507.md)   What does this mean?  It
threatens him with a complete drought, with an absence of the aerial
waters which cause the fruits of the earth to be brought forth and to
grow.

<span id="viii.iv-p83"></span>Since, then, Scripture says that the dew
or the rain falls from heaven, we understand that it is from those
waters which have been ordered to occupy the higher regions.  When the
exhalations from the earth, gathered together in the heights of the air,
are condensed under the pressure of the wind, this aerial moisture
diffuses itself in vaporous and light clouds; then mingling again, it
forms drops which fall, dragged down by their own weight; and this is
the origin of rain.  When water beaten by the violence of the wind,
changes into foam, and passing through excessive cold quite freezes, it
breaks the cloud, and falls as snow. <span
id="fr_1508"></span>[1509](#fn_1508.md)   You can thus account for all the
moist substances that the air suspends over our heads.

<span id="viii.iv-p85"></span>And do not let any one compare with the
inquisitive discussions of philosophers upon the heavens, the simple and
inartificial character of the utterances of the Spirit; as the beauty of
chaste women surpasses that of a harlot, <span
id="fr_1509"></span>[1510](#fn_1509.md) so our arguments are superior to
those of our opponents.  They only seek to persuade by forced
reasoning.  With us truth presents itself naked and without artifice. 
But why torment ourselves to refute the errors of philosophers, when it
is sufficient to produce their mutually contradictory books, and, as
quiet spectators, to watch the war? <span
id="fr_1510"></span>[1511](#fn_1510.md)   For those thinkers are not less
numerous, nor less celebrated, nor more sober in speech in fighting
their adversaries, who say that the universe is being consumed by fire,
and that from the seeds which remain in the ashes of the burnt world all
is being brought to life again.  Hence in the world there is destruction
and palingenesis to infinity. <span id="fr_1511"></span>[1512](#fn_1511.md)
  All, equally far from the truth, find each on their side by-ways which
lead them to error.

<span id="viii.iv-p89"></span>9.  But as far as concerns the separation
of the waters I am obliged to contest the <span id="page_71">p.
71</span> <span id="viii.iv-Page_71"></span>opinion of certain writers
in the Church <span id="fr_1512"></span>[1513](#fn_1512.md) who, under the
shadow of high and sublime conceptions, have launched out into metaphor,
and have only seen in the waters a figure to denote spiritual and
incorporeal powers.  In the higher regions, above the firmament, dwell
the better; in the lower regions, earth and matter are the dwelling
place of the malignant.  So, say they, God is praised by the waters that
are above the heaven, that is to say, by the good powers, the purity of
whose soul makes them worthy to sing the praises of God.  And the waters
which are under the heaven represent the wicked spirits, who from their
natural height have fallen into the abyss of evil.  Turbulent,
seditious, agitated by the tumultuous waves of passion, they have
received the name of sea, because of the instability and the inconstancy
of their movements. <span id="fr_1513"></span>[1514](#fn_1513.md)   Let us
reject these theories as dreams and old women’s tales.  Let us
understand that by water water is meant; for the dividing of the waters
by the firmament let us accept the reason which has been given us. 
Although, however, waters above the heaven are invited to give glory to
the Lord of the Universe, do not let us think of them as intelligent
beings; the heavens are not alive because they “declare the glory of
God,” nor the firmament a sensible being because it “sheweth His
handiwork.” <span id="fr_1514"></span>[1515](#fn_1514.md)   And if they
tell you that the heavens mean contemplative powers, and the firmament
active powers which produce good, we admire the theory as ingenious
without being able to acknowledge the truth of it.  For thus dew, the
frost, cold and heat, which in Daniel are ordered to praise the Creator
of all things, <span id="fr_1515"></span>[1516](#fn_1515.md) will be
intelligent and invisible natures.  But this is only a figure, accepted
as such by enlightened minds, to complete the glory of the Creator. 
Besides, the waters above the heavens, these waters privileged by the
virtue which they possess in themselves, are not the only waters to
celebrate the praises of God.  “Praise the Lord from the earth, ye
dragons and all deeps.” <span id="fr_1516"></span>[1517](#fn_1516.md)  
Thus the singer of the Psalms does not reject the deeps which our
inventors of allegories rank in the divisions of evil; he admits them to
the universal choir of creation, and the deeps sing in their language a
harmonious hymn to the glory of the Creator.

<span id="viii.iv-p95"></span>10.  “*And God saw that it was good*.” 
God does not judge of the beauty of His work by the charm of the eyes,
and He does not form the same idea of beauty that we do.  What He
esteems beautiful is that which presents in its perfection all the
fitness <span id="fr_1517"></span>[1518](#fn_1517.md) of art, and that
which tends to the usefulness of its end.  He, then, who proposed to
Himself a manifest design in His works, approved each one of them, as
fulfilling its end in accordance with His creative purpose.  A hand, an
eye, or any portion of a statue lying apart from the rest, would look
beautiful to no one.  But if each be restored to its own place, the
beauty of proportion, until now almost unperceived, would strike even
the most uncultivated.  But the artist, before uniting the parts of his
work, distinguishes and recognises the beauty of each of them, thinking
of the object that he has in view.  It is thus that Scripture depicts to
us the Supreme Artist, praising each one of His works; soon, when His
work is complete, He will accord well deserved praise to the whole
together.  Let me here end my discourse on the second day, to allow my
industrious hearers to examine what they have just heard.  May their
memory retain it for the profit of their soul; may they by careful
meditation inwardly digest and benefit by what I say.  As for those who
live by their work, let me allow them to attend all day to their
business, so that they may come, with a soul free from anxiety, to the
banquet of my discourse in the evening.  May God who, after having made
such great things, put such weak words in my mouth, grant you the
intelligence of His truth, so that you may raise yourselves from visible
things to the invisible Being, and that the grandeur and beauty of
creatures may give you a just idea of the Creator.  For the visible
things of Him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, and His
power and divinity are eternal. <span
id="fr_1518"></span>[1519](#fn_1518.md)   Thus earth, air, sky, water, day,
night, all visible things, remind us of who is our Benefactor.  We shall
not therefore give occasion to sin, we shall not give place to the enemy
within us, if by unbroken recollection we keep God ever dwelling in our
hearts, to Whom be all glory and all adoration, now and for ever, world
without end.  Amen.

Epicurean Lucretius (v. 501), “*Suos ignes fert*;” *i.e*. the fiery
stars are of the nature of the element in which they move.  *cf*. the
Stoic Manilius i. 149, “*Ignis in æthereas volucer se sustulit oras
summaque complexus stellantis culmina cœli, Flammarum vallo naturæ mœnia
fecit*.”

<span id="viii.iv-p74"></span> Pliny (ii. 103, 104) writes:  “*Itaque
solis ardore siccatur liquor;…sic mari late patenti saporem incoqui
salis, aut quia exhausto inde dulci tenuique, quod facillime, trahat vis
ignea, omne asperius crassiusque linquatur:  ideo summa æquarum aqua
dulciorem profundam:  hanc esse veriorem causam asperi saporis, quam
quod mare terræ sudor sit æternus:  aut quia plurimum ex arido misceatur
illi vapore, aut quia terræ natura sicut medicatas aquas inficiat*.” 
The first of these three theories was that of Hippocrates (*De Aere,
Locis, et Aquis*, iv. 197) and of Anaximander (Plutarch <span
class="Greek"><span id="viii.iv-p74.1"></span>περὶ τῶν ἀρέσκ</span>,
etc. ii. 552).  On the second *vide* Arist., *Prob*. xxiii. 30.  The
idea of the sea being the earth’s sweat was that of Empedocles.  *cf*.
Arist., *Meteor*. ii. 1.

Beautiful*, iii. § 6):  “It is true that the infinitely wise and good
creator has, of his bounty, frequently joined beauty to those things
which he has made useful to us.  But this does not prove that our idea
of use and beauty are the same thing, or that they are in any way
dependent on each other.”  Dr. Johnson instances a painting on a
coffee-cup as beautiful, but not useful.  “Boswell,” Ann. 1772.  St.
Basil’s idea is in accord with that of Ruskin (*Mod. P.* chap. vi.). 
“In all high ideas of beauty it is more than probable that much of the
pleasure depends on delicate and untraceable perception of fitness,
propriety, and relation, which are purely intellectual, and through
which we arrive at our noblest ideas of what is commonly and rightly
called ‘intellectual beauty.’”
