<span id="ix.ccxxxix-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.ccxxxix-p1.1"></span>Letter CCXXXVIII. <span
id="fr_3010"></span>[3011](#fn_3010) </span>

<span id="ix.ccxxxix-p3"></span>*To the presbyters of Nicopolis*. <span
id="fr_3011"></span>[3012](#fn_3011)

<span id="ix.ccxxxix-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.ccxxxix-p5.1"></span>I have</span> received your letter, my
reverend brethren, but it told me nothing that I did not already know,
for the whole country round about was already full of the report <span
id="page_280">p. 280</span> <span
id="ix.ccxxxix-Page_280"></span>announcing the disgrace of that one
among you who has fallen, and through lust of vain glory has brought on
himself very shameful dishonour, and has through his self-love lost the
rewards promised to faith.  Nay, through the just hatred of them that
fear the Lord he misses even that contemptible little glory for lust of
which he has been sold to impiety.  By the character he has now shown he
has very plainly proved, concerning all his life, that he has never at
any time lived in hope of the promises laid up for us by the Lord, but,
in all his transactions of human affairs, has used words of faith and
mockery of piety, all to deceive every one whom he met.  But how are you
injured?  Are you any worse off for this than you were before?  One of
your number has fallen away, and if one or two others have gone with
him, they are to be pitied for their fall, but, by God’s grace, your
body is whole.  The useless part has gone, and what is left has not
suffered mutilation.  You are haply distressed that you are driven
without the walls, but you shall dwell under the protection of the God
of Heaven, <span id="fr_3012"></span>[3013](#fn_3012) and the angel who
watches over the Church has gone out with you.  So they lie down in
empty places day by day, bringing upon themselves heavy judgment through
the dispersion of the people.  And, if in all this there is sorrow to be
borne, I trust in the Lord that it will not be without its use to you. 
Therefore, the more have been your trials, look for a more perfect
reward from your just Judge.  Do not take your present troubles ill.  Do
not lose hope.  Yet a little while and your Helper will come to you and
will not tarry. <span id="fr_3013"></span>[3014](#fn_3013)
