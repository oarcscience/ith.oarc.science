<span id="ix.lxxii-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.lxxii-p1.1"></span>Letter LXXI. <span
id="fr_2253"></span>[2254](#fn_2253.md) </span>

<span id="ix.lxxii-p3"></span>*Basil to Gregory*. <span
id="fr_2254"></span>[2255](#fn_2254.md)

<span id="ix.lxxii-p5"></span>1. <span class="c14"><span
id="ix.lxxii-p5.1"></span> I have</span> received the letter of your
holiness, by the most reverend brother Helenius, and what you have
intimated he has told me in plain terms.  How I felt on hearing it, you
cannot doubt at all.  However, since I have determined that my affection
for you shall outweigh my pain, whatever it is, I have accepted it as I
ought to do, and I pray the holy God, that my remaining days or hours
may be as carefully conducted in their disposition towards you as they
have been in past time, during which, my conscience tells me, I have
been wanting to you in nothing small or great.  \[But that the man who
boasts that he is now just beginning to take a look at the life of
Christians, and thinks he will get some credit by having something to do
with me, should invent what he has not heard, and narrate what he has
never experienced, is not at all surprising.  What is surprising and
extraordinary is that he has got my best friends among the brethren at
Nazianzus to listen to him; and not only to listen to him, but as it
seems, to take in what he says.  On most grounds it might be surprising
that the slanderer is of such a character, and that I am the victim, but
these troublous times have taught us to bear everything with patience. 
Slights greater than this have, for my sins, long been things of common
occurrence with me.  I have never yet given this man’s brethren any
evidence of my sentiments <span id="fr_2255"></span>[2256](#fn_2255.md)
about God, and I have no answer to make now.  Men who are not convinced
by long experience are not likely to be convinced by a short letter.  If
the former is enough let the charges of the slanderers be counted as
idle tales.  But if I give license to unbridled mouths, and uninstructed
hearts, to talk about whom they will, all the while keeping my ears
ready to listen, I shall not be alone in hearing what is said by other
people; they will have to hear what I have to say.\]

<span id="ix.lxxii-p7"></span>2.  I know what has led to all this, and
have urged every topic to hinder it; but now I am sick of the subject,
and will say no more about it, I mean our little intercourse.  For had
we kept our old promise to each other, and had due regard to the claims
which the Churches have on us, we should have been the greater part of
the year together; and then there would have been no opening for these
calumniators.  Pray have nothing to say to them; let me persuade you to
come here and assist me in my labours, particularly in my contest with
the individual who is now assailing me.  Your very appearance will have
the effect of stopping him; directly you show these disturbers of our
home that you will, by God’s blessing, place yourself at the head of our
party, you will break up their cabal, and you will shut every unjust
mouth that speaketh unrighteousness against God.  And thus facts will
show who are your followers in good, and who are the halters and
cowardly betrayers of the word of truth.  If, however, the Church be
betrayed, why then I shall care little to set men right about myself, by
means of words, who account of me as men would naturally account who
have not yet learned to measure themselves.  Perhaps, in a short time,
by God’s grace, I shall be able to refute their slanders by very deed,
for it seems likely that I shall have soon to suffer somewhat for the
truth’s sake more than usual; the best I can expect is banishment, or,
if this hope fails, after all Christ’s judgment-seat is not far
distant.  \[If then you ask for a meeting for the Churches’ sake, I am
ready to betake myself whithersoever you invite me.  But if it is only a
question of refuting these slanders, I really have no time to reply to
them.\]

<span id="ix.lxxii-p4"></span> When Gregory, on the elevation of Basil
to the Episcopate, was at last induced to visit his old friend, he
declined the dignities which Basil pressed upon him (<span

bishop, *Orat*. xliii. 39), and made no long stay.  Some Nazianzene
scandal-mongers had charged Basil with heterodoxy.  Gregory asked him
for explanations, and Basil, somewhat wounded, rejoins that no
explanations are needed.  The translation in the text with the exception
of the passages in brackets, is that of Newman.  *cf. Proleg*. and reff.
