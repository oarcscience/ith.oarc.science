<span id="ix.cclxx-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.cclxx-p1.1"></span>Letter CCLXIX. <span
id="fr_3217"></span>[3218](#fn_3217.md) </span>

<span id="ix.cclxx-p3"></span>To the wife of Arinthæus, the General. 
Consolatory.

<span id="ix.cclxx-p4"></span>1.  <span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cclxx-p4.1"></span>It</span> had been only proper, and due to
your affection, that I should have been on the spot, and have taken part
in the present occurrences.  Thus I might have at once assuaged my own
sorrow, and given some consolation to your excellency.  But my body will
no longer endure long journeys, and so I am driven to approach you by
letter, that I seem not to count what has happened as altogether of no
interest to me.  Who has not mourned for that man?  Who is so stony of
heart as not to have shed a warm tear over him?  I especially have been
filled with mourning at the thought of all the marks of respect which I
have received from him, and of the general protection which he has
extended to the Churches of God.  Nevertheless, I have bethought me that
he was human, and had done the work he had to do in this life, and now
in the appointed time has been taken back again by God Who ordains our
lots.  All this, I beseech you, in your wisdom, to take to heart, and to
meet the event with meekness, and, so far as is possible, to endure your
loss with moderation.  Time may be able to soothe your heart, and allow
the approach of reason.  At the same time your great love for your
husband, and your goodness to all, lead me to fear that, from the very
simplicity of your character, the wound of your grief may pierce you
deeply, and that you may give yourself up entirely to your feelings. 
The teaching of Scripture is always useful, and specially at times like
this.  Remember, then, the sentence passed by our Creator.  By it all we
who are dust shall return to dust. <span
id="fr_3218"></span>[3219](#fn_3218.md)   No one is so great as to be
superior to dissolution.

<span id="ix.cclxx-p6"></span>2.  Your admirable husband was a good and
great man, and his bodily strength <span id="page_308">p. 308</span>
<span id="ix.cclxx-Page_308"></span>rivalled the virtues of his soul. 
He was unsurpassed, I must own, in both respects.  But he was human, and
he is dead; like Adam, like Abel, like Noah, like Abraham, like Moses,
or any one else of like nature that you can name.  Let us not then
complain because he has been taken from us.  Let us rather thank Him,
who joined us to him, that we dwelt with him from the beginning.  To
lose a husband is a lot which you share with other women; but to have
been united to such a husband is a boast which I do not think any other
woman can make.  In truth our Creator fashioned that man for us as a
model of what human nature ought to be.  All eyes were attracted towards
him, and every tongue told of his deeds.  Painters and sculptors fell
short of his excellence, and historians, when they tell the story of his
achievements in war, seem to fall into the region of the mythical and
the incredible.  Thus it has come about that most men have not even been
able to give credit to the report conveying the sad tidings, or to
accept the truth of the news that Arinthæus is dead.  Nevertheless
Arinthæus has suffered what will happen to heaven and to sun and to
earth.  He has died a bright death; not bowed down by old age; without
losing one whit of his honour; great in this life; great in the life to
come; deprived of nothing of his present splendour in view of the glory
hoped for, because he washed away all the stain of his soul, in the very
moment of his departure hence, in the laver of regeneration.  That you
should have arranged and joined in this rite is cause of supreme
consolation.  Turn now your thoughts from the present to the future,
that you may be worthy through good works to obtain a place of rest like
his.  Spare an aged mother; spare a tender daughter, to whom you are now
the sole comfort.  Be an example of fortitude to other women, and so
regulate your grief that you may neither eject it from your heart, nor
be overwhelmed by your distress.  Ever keep your eyes fixed on the great
reward of patience, promised, as the requital of the deeds of this life,
by our Lord Jesus Christ. <span id="fr_3219"></span>[3220](#fn_3219.md)
