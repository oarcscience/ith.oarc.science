<span id="ix.xlviii-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.xlviii-p1.1"></span>Letter XLVII. <span
id="fr_2156"></span>[2157](#fn_2156.md) </span>

<span id="ix.xlviii-p3"></span>*To Gregory*. <span
id="fr_2157"></span>[2158](#fn_2157.md)

<span id="ix.xlviii-p5"></span>“<span class="c14"><span
id="ix.xlviii-p5.1"></span>Who</span> will give me wings like a
dove? <span id="fr_2158"></span>[2159](#fn_2158.md)   Or how can my old age
be so renewed that I can travel to your affection, satisfy my deep
longing to see you, tell you all the troubles of my soul, and get from
you some comfort in my affliction?  For when the blessed bishop
Eusebius <span id="fr_2159"></span>[2160](#fn_2159.md) fell asleep, we were
under no small alarm lest plotters against the Church of our Metropolis,
wishful to fill it with their heretical tares, should seize the present
opportunity, root out by their wicked teaching the true faith sown by
much labour in men’s souls, and destroy its unity.  This has been the
result of their action in many churches. <span
id="fr_2160"></span>[2161](#fn_2160.md)   When however I received the
letters of the clergy exhorting me not to let their needs be overlooked
at such a crisis, as I ranged my eyes in all directions I bethought me
of your loving spirit, your right faith, and your unceasing zeal on
behalf of the churches of God.  I have therefore sent the well beloved
Eustathius, <span id="fr_2161"></span>[2162](#fn_2161.md) the deacon, to
invite your reverence, and implore you to <span id="page_153">p.
153</span> <span id="ix.xlviii-Page_153"></span>add this one more to all
your labours on behalf of the Church.  I entreat you also to refresh my
old age by a sight of you; and to maintain for the true Church its
famous orthodoxy, by uniting with me, if I may be deemed worthy of
uniting with you, in the good work, to give it a shepherd in accordance
with the will of the Lord, able to guide His people aright.  I have
before my eyes a man not unknown even to yourself.  If only we be found
worthy to secure him, I am sure that we shall acquire a confident access
to God and confer a very great benefit on the people who have invoked
our aid.  Now once again, aye, many times I call on you, all hesitation
put aside, to come to meet me, and to set out before the difficulties of
winter intervene.

<span id="ix.xlviii-p2"></span> Placed in 370.  The letters numbered 47
to 291, inclusive, are placed by the Benedictine editors during St.
Basil’s episcopate.

id="ix.xlviii-p3.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xlviii-p4"></span> On this title Benedictine editors remark
that no careful reader can fail to note that the letter is written not
by Basil but about Basil.  “*Hodie*,” they write, “*inter eruditos fere
convenit eam a Gregorio patre, filii manu, ad Eusebium Samosatensem
scriptam fuisse.  Nam senem se esse declarat auctor Epistolæ et in
Cappadocia Episcopum, ut qui litteris cleri ad electionem Episcopi, et
Ecclesiæ Cæsariensis defesionem invitatus fuerit.  Is autem ad quem
scribit et eadem dignitate præditus erat, et laboribus pro Ecclesia
susceptis clarus, et amicus Basilio, nec Cappadociæ vicinus.  Omnia in
Eusebium Samosatensem mirifice conveniunt, quem Basilii ordinationi
scimus interfuisse*,” and they give, moreover, as their descriptive
heading:  “*Gregorius Theologi pater Eusebium Samosatensem, misso
Eustathio diacono, invitat ad electionem Episcopi Cæsariensis ut eo
adjuvante Basilius eligi possit*.”  Fialon, however, apparently
forgetting the reference to old age, writes (*Étude Hist*. p. 87, n.): 
“*<span id="ix.xlviii-p4.1"></span>Cette lettre est évidemment de
Grégoire de Nazianze*,” meaning the younger.  The election of St. Basil,
who probably “*<span id="ix.xlviii-p4.2"></span>voluit episcopari*” to
the archiepiscopal throne, was indeed mainly due to the intervention of
the elder Gregory.  Basil’s unfortunate and indefensible
disingenuousness in summoning the younger Gregory to Cæsarea on the plea
of his own severe illness defeated its object.  But for the prompt and
practical intervention of Gregory the elder, and this appeal to Eusebius
of Samosata, the archbishopric might have fallen into unworthy, or at
least inferior, hands.  *Vide* Biog. Notice in *Proleg*.,  .

<span id="ix.xlviii-p7"></span> Eusebius, at the time of his election an
unbaptized layman, was elevated to the throne of Cæsarea on the death of
Dianius in 362.  In this case too it was due to the counsels of the
elder Gregory that the objections both of Eusebius and of the bishops,
forced by the opposing party to consecrate him, were finally overcome. 
It was he who ordained Basil to the presbyterate and chafed against the
ascendancy of his more able and brilliant subordinate.

id="ix.xlviii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xlviii-p8"></span> In 365 Valens came to Cæsarea with Arian
bishops, and endeavoured to put down the Catholics.  Basil returned from
his retreat in order to aid Eusebius in resisting the attack, and seems
to have shown much tact and good feeling as well as vigour and ability.

<span id="ix.xlviii-p9"></span> *cf. Letter* cxxxvi., where it appears
that Basil kindly nursed a deacon Eustathius.  The fact of an Eustathius
being one of Basil’s deacons is so far in favour of Basil’s having
written the letter.  But Eustathius was a common name, and Eustathius, a
monk, is mentioned in the will of Gregory of Nazianzus.
