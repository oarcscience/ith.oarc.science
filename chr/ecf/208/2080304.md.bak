<span id="ix.ccxxxii-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.ccxxxii-p1.1"></span>Letter CCXXXI. <span
id="fr_2939"></span>[2940](#fn_2939.md) </span>

<span id="ix.ccxxxii-p3"></span>To Amphilochius, bishop of Iconium.

<span id="ix.ccxxxii-p4"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.ccxxxii-p4.1"></span>I find</span> few opportunities of writing
to your reverence, and this causes me no little trouble.  It is just the
same as if, when it was in my power to see you and enjoy your society
very often, I did so but seldom.  But it is impossible for me to write
to you because so few travel hence to you, otherwise there is no reason
why my letter should not be a kind of journal of my life, to tell you,
my dear friend, everything that happens to me day by day.  It is a
comfort to me to tell you my affairs, and I know that you care for
nothing more than for what concerns me.  Now, however, Elpidius <span
id="fr_2940"></span>[2941](#fn_2940.md) is going home to his own master, to
refute the calumnies falsely got up against him by certain enemies, and
he has asked me for a letter.  I therefore salute your reverence by him
and commend to you a man who deserves your protection, at once for the
sake of justice and for my own sake.  Although I could say nothing else
in his favour, yet, because he has made it of very great importance to
be the bearer of my letter, reckon him among our friends, and remember
me and pray for the Church.

<span id="ix.ccxxxii-p6"></span>You must know that my very God-beloved
brother is in exile, for he could not endure the annoyance caused him by
shameless persons. <span id="fr_2941"></span>[2942](#fn_2941.md)  
Doara <span id="fr_2942"></span>[2943](#fn_2942.md) is in a state of
agitation, for the fat sea monster <span
id="fr_2943"></span>[2944](#fn_2943.md) is throwing everything into
confusion.  My enemies, as I am informed by those who know, are plotting
against me at court.  But hitherto the hand of the Lord has been over
me.  Only pray that I be not abandoned in the end.  My brother is taking
things quietly.  Doara has received the old muleteer. <span
id="fr_2944"></span>[2945](#fn_2944.md)   She can do no more.  The Lord
will scatter the counsels of my enemies.  The one cure for all my
troubles present and to come is to set eyes on you.  If you possibly
can, while I am still alive, do come to see me.  The book on the Spirit
has been written by me, and is finished, as you know.  My brethren here
have prevented me from sending it to you written on paper, and have told
me that they had your excellency’s orders to engross it on
parchment. <span id="fr_2945"></span>[2946](#fn_2945.md)   Not, then, to
appear to do anything against your injunctions, I have delayed now, but
I will send it a little later, if only I find any suitable person to
convey it.  May you be granted to me and to God’s Church by the kindness
of the Holy One, in all health and happiness, and praying for me to the
Lord.

<span id="ix.ccxxxii-p5"></span> It is doubtful whether this Elpidius is
to be identified with any other of the same name mentioned in the
letters.

<span id="ix.ccxxxii-p9"></span> *i.e.*Demosthenes.  Such language may
seem inconsistent with the tone of *Letter* ccxxv., but that, it will be
remembered, was an official and formal document, while the present
letter is addressed to an intimate friend.
