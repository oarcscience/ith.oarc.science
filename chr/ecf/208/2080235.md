<span id="ix.clxiii-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.clxiii-p5.1"></span>The</span> same cause seems to make me
hesitate to write, and to prove that I must write.  When I think of the
visit which I owe, and reckon up the gain at meeting you, I cannot help
despising letters, as being not even shadows in comparison with the
reality.  Then, again, when I reckon that my only consolation, deprived
as I am of all that is best and most important, is to salute such a man
and beg him, as I am wont, not to forget me in his prayers, I bethink me
that letters are of no small value.  I do not, myself, wish to give up
all hope of my visit, nor to despair of seeing you.  I should be ashamed
not to seem to put so much confidence in your prayers as even to expect
to be turned from an old man into a young one, if such a need were to
arise, and not merely from a sick and emaciated one, as I am now, into
one a little bit stronger.  It is not easy to express in words the
reason of my not being with you already, because I am not only prevented
by actual illness, but have not even force of speech enough at any time
to give you an account of such manifold and complex disease.  I can only
say that, ever since Easter up to now, fever, diarrhœa, and intestinal
disturbance, drowning me like waves, do not suffer me to lift my head
above them.  Brother Barachus may be able to tell you the character of
my symptoms, if not as their severity deserves, at least clearly enough
to make you understand the reason of my delay.  If you join cordially in
my prayers, I have no doubt that my troubles will easily pass away.
