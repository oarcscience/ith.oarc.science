id="ix.ccliv-p5.1"></span>The</span> anxious care which you have for the
Churches of God will to some extent be assuaged by our very dear and
very reverend brother Sanctissimus the presbyter, when he has told you
of the love and kindness felt for us by all the West.  But, on the other
hand, it will be roused afresh and made yet keener, when he has told you
in person what zeal is demanded by the present position of affairs.  All
other authorities have told us, as it were, by halves, the minds of men
in the West, and the condition of things there.  He is very competent to
understand men’s minds, and to make exact enquiry into the condition of
affairs, and he will tell you everything and will guide your good will
through the whole business.  You have matter before you <span

you have always shewn in your anxiety on behalf of the Churches of God.

<span id="ix.ccliv-p4"></span> This and the three following letters are
complimentary and consolatory epistles conveyed by Sanctissimus on his
return to Rome.  It does not appear quite certain whether they are to be
referred to the period of his return from his second journey to the East
in 376, or that of his earlier return in 374.  *cf. Letters* cxx. and
ccxxi.
