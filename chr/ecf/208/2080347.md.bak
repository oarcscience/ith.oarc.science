id="fr_3229"></span>[3230](#fn_3229.md) </span>

<span id="ix.cclxxv-p3"></span>To Himerius, the master.

<span id="ix.cclxxv-p4"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cclxxv-p4.1"></span>That</span> my friendship and affection for
the very reverend brother Hera began when I was quite a boy, and has, by
God’s grace, continued up to my old age, no one knows better than
yourself.  For the Lord granted me the affection of your excellency at
about the same time that He allowed me to become acquainted with Hera. 
He now needs your patronage, and I therefore beseech and supplicate you
to do a favour for the sake of our old affection, and to heed the
necessity under which we now lie.  I beg you to make his cause your own,
that he may need no other protection, but may return to me, successful
in all that he is praying for.  Then to the many kindnesses which I have
received at your hands I shall be able to add yet this one more.  I
could not claim any favour more important to myself, or one more nearly
touching my own interests.
