<span id="ix.viii-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.viii-p5.1"></span>When</span> I wrote to you, I was perfectly
well aware that no theological term is adequate to the thought of the
speaker, or the want of the questioner, because language is of natural
necessity too weak to act in the service of objects of thought.  If then
our thought is weak, and our tongue weaker than our thought, what was to
be expected of me in what I said but that I should be charged with
poverty of expression?  Still, it was not possible to let your question
pass unnoticed.  It looks like a betrayal, if we do not readily give an
answer about God to them that love the Lord.  What has been said,
however, whether it seems satisfactory, or requires some further and
more careful addition, needs a fit season for correction.  For the
present I implore you, as I have implored you before, to devote yourself
entirely to the advocacy of the truth, and to the intellectual energies
God gives you for the establishment of what is good.  With this be
content, and ask nothing more from me.  I am really much less capable
than is supposed, and am more likely to do harm to the word by my
weakness than to add strength to the truth by my advocacy.
