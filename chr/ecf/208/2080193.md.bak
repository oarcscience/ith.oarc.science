<span id="ix.cxxi-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.cxxi-p1.1"></span>Letter CXX. <span
id="fr_2396"></span>[2397](#fn_2396.md) </span>

<span id="ix.cxxi-p3"></span>*To Meletius, bishop of Antioch*. <span
id="fr_2397"></span>[2398](#fn_2397.md)

<span id="ix.cxxi-p5"></span>I <span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cxxi-p5.1"></span>have</span> received a letter from the very
God-beloved bishop Eusebius, in which he enjoins that a second letter be
written to the Westerns about certain Church matters.  He has expressed
a wish that the letter should be drawn up by me, and signed by all those
who are in communion.  Having no means of writing a letter about these
wishes of his, I have sent on his minute to your holiness, in order
that, when you have read it and can give heed to the information given
by the very dear brother Sanctissimus, our fellow presbyter, you may
yourself be so good as to indite a letter on these points as seems best
to you.  We are prepared to agree to it and to lose no time in having it
conveyed to those in communion with us, so that, when all have signed it
may be carried by the messenger, who is on the point of starting on his
journey to visit the bishops of the West.  Give orders for the decision
of your holiness to be communicated to me as quickly as possible, that I
may not be ignorant of your intentions.

<span id="ix.cxxi-p6"></span>As to the intrigue which is now being
devised, or has already been devised against <span id="page_193">p.
193</span> <span id="ix.cxxi-Page_193"></span>me, in Antioch, the same
brother will convey intimation to your holiness, unless indeed the
report of what has been done does not anticipate him and make the
position clear.  There is ground for hope that the threats are coming to
an end.

<span id="ix.cxxi-p7"></span>I wish your reverence to know that our
brother Anthimus has ordained Faustus, who is living with the pope <span
id="fr_2398"></span>[2399](#fn_2398.md) as bishop, without having received
the votes, and in place of our right reverend brother Cyril.  Thus he
has filled Armenia with schisms.  I have thought it right to tell your
reverence this, lest they should lie against me, and I be responsible
for these disorderly proceedings.  You will of course deem it right to
make this known to the rest.  I think such irregularity will distress
many.

<span id="ix.cxxi-p4"></span> Basil keeps up his support of the claims
of Meletius, now in exile in Armenia, to be recognised as Catholic
bishop of Antioch, and complains of the irregular ordination of Faustus
as bishop of an Armenian see by Basil’s opponent, Anthimus of Tyana. 
Sanctissimus, the bearer of the letter, is supposed by Tillemont (vol.
ix. p. 219) to be a Western on account of his Latin name.  Maran (*Vit.
Bas*. 26) points out that Orientals not infrequently bore Latin names,
and supposes him to be a presbyter of Antioch.

<span id="ix.cxxi-p8"></span> The title was not even at this time
confined to bishops, and who this papa is is quite uncertain.  The title
is not generally limited to the bishop of Rome until the eighth
century.  So late as 680 Cyrus is called pope of Alexandria at the Sixth
Council.  (Mansi xi. 214.)  It was not till 1073 that Gregory VII.
asserted an exclusive right to the name.  (Gieseler, vol. 1, 2, 405.)
