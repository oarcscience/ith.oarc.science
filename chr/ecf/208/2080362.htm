<p class="c54"><a name="ix.ccxc-p3"></A>Without address.&#160; Concerning an afflicted woman.</p>  
<p class="c20"><a name="ix.ccxc-p4"></A>I <span class="c14"><a name="ix.ccxc-p4.1"></A>consider</span> it an equal mistake, to let the guilty go unpunished, and to exceed the proper limits of punishment.&#160; I accordingly passed upon this man the sentence I considered it incumbent on me to pass&#8212;excommunication from the Church.&#160; The sufferer I exhorted not to avenge herself; but to leave to God the redressing of her wrongs.&#160; Thus if my admonitions had possessed any weight, I should then have been obeyed, for the language I employed was far more likely to ensure credit, than any letter to enforce compliance.</p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="ix.ccxc-p5"></A>So, even after listening to her statements that contained matter sufficiently grave, I still held my peace; and even now I am not sure that it becomes me to treat again of this same question.</p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="ix.ccxc-p6"></A>For, she says, I have foregone husband, children, all the enjoyments of life, for the attainment of this single object, the favour of God, and good repute amongst men.&#160; Yet one day the offender, an adept from boyhood in corrupting families, with the impudence habitual to him, forced an entrance into my house; and thus within the bare limits of an interview an acquaintanceship was formed.&#160; It was only owing to my ignorance of the man, and to that timidity which comes from inexperience, that I hesitated openly to turn him out of doors.&#160; Yet to such a pitch of impiety and insolence did he come, that he filled the whole city with slanders, and publicly inveighed against me by affixing to the church doors libellous placards.&#160; For this conduct, it is true, he incurred the displeasure of the law:&#160; but, nevertheless, he returned to his slanderous attacks on me.&#160; Once more the market-place was filled with his abuse, as well as the gymnasia, theatres, and houses whose congeniality of habits gained him an admittance.&#160; Nor did his very extravagance lead men to recognise those virtues wherein I was conspicuous, so universally had I been represented as being of an incontinent disposition.&#160; In these calumnies, she goes on to say, some find a delight&#8212;such is the pleasure men naturally feel in the disparagement of others; some profess to be pained, but shew no sympathy; others believe the truth of these slanders; others again, having regard to the persistency of his oaths, are undecided.&#160; But sympathy I have none.&#160; And now indeed I begin to realise my loneliness, and bewail myself.&#160; I have no brother, friend, relation, no servant, bond or free, in a word, no one whatever to share my grief.&#160; And yet, I think, I am more than any one else an object of pity, in a city where the haters of wickedness are so few.&#160; They bandy violence; but violence, though they fail to see it, moves in a circle, and in time will overtake each one of them.</p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="ix.ccxc-p7"></A>In such and still more appealing terms she told her tale, with countless tears, and so departed.&#160; Nor did she altogether acquit me of blame; thinking that, when I ought to sympathise with her like a father, I am indifferent to her troubles, and regard the sufferings of others too philosophically.</p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="ix.ccxc-p8"></A>For it is not, she urged, the loss of money that you bid me disregard; nor the endurance of bodily sufferings; but a damaged reputation, an injury involving loss upon the Church at large.</p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="ix.ccxc-p9"></A>This is her appeal; and now I pray you, most excellent sir, consider what answer you would have me make her.&#160; The decision I have come to in my own mind is, not to surrender offenders to the magistrates; yet not to rescue those already in their custody, since it has long ago been declared by the Apostle, that the magistrates should be a terror to them in their evil-doings; for, it is said, &#8220;he beareth not the sword in vain.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3251"></A><A HREF="#fn_3251"><FONT SIZE="1">3252</FONT></A>
&#160; To surrender him, then, is contrary to my humanity; while to release him would be an encouragement to his violence.</p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="ix.ccxc-p11"></A>Perhaps, however, you will defer taking action until my arrival.&#160; I will then shew you that I can effect nothing from there being none to obey me.</p>
