<span id="vii.xxix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vii.xxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVIII.</span>

<span id="vii.xxix-p2"></span>That our opponents refuse to concede in
the case of the Spirit the terms which Scripture uses in the case of
men, as reigning together with Christ.

<span id="vii.xxix-p3"></span>69.  <span class="c14"><span
id="vii.xxix-p3.1"></span>But</span> let us see if we can bethink us of
any defence of this usage of our fathers; for they who first originated
the expression are more open to blame than we ourselves.  Paul in his
Letter to the Colossians says, “And you, being dead in your sins and the
uncircumcision…hath He quickened together with” <span
id="fr_1285"></span>[1286](#fn_1285.md) Christ.  Did then God give to a
whole people and to the Church the boon of the life with Christ, and yet
the life with Christ does not belong to the Holy Spirit?  But if this is
impious even to think of, is it not rightly reverent so to make our
confession, as They are by nature in close conjunction?  Furthermore
what boundless lack of sensibility does it not shew in these men to
confess that the Saints are with Christ, (if, as we know is the case,
Paul, on becoming absent from the body, is present with the <span
id="page_44">p. 44</span> <span id="vii.xxix-Page_44"></span>Lord, <span
id="fr_1286"></span>[1287](#fn_1286.md) and, after departing, is with
Christ <span id="fr_1287"></span>[1288](#fn_1287) .md) and, so far as lies
in their power, to refuse to allow to the Spirit to be with Christ even
to the same extent as men?  And Paul calls himself a “labourer together
with God” <span id="fr_1288"></span>[1289](#fn_1288.md) in the dispensation
of the Gospel; will they bring an indictment for impiety against us, if
we apply the term “fellow-labourer” to the Holy Spirit, through whom in
every creature under heaven the Gospel bringeth forth fruit? <span
id="fr_1289"></span>[1290](#fn_1289.md)   The life of them that have
trusted in the Lord “is hidden,” it would seem, “with Christ in God, and
when Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall” they themselves
also “appear with Him in glory;” <span
id="fr_1290"></span>[1291](#fn_1290.md) and is the Spirit of life Himself,
“Who made us free from the law of sin,” <span
id="fr_1291"></span>[1292](#fn_1291.md) not with Christ, both in the secret
and hidden life with Him, and in the manifestation of the glory which we
expect to be manifested in the saints?  We are “heirs of God and joint
heirs with Christ,” <span id="fr_1292"></span>[1293](#fn_1292.md) and is
the Spirit without part or lot in the fellowship of God and of His
Christ?  “The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are
the children of God;” <span id="fr_1293"></span>[1294](#fn_1293.md) and are
we not to allow to the Spirit even that testimony of His fellowship with
God which we have learnt from the Lord?  For the height of folly is
reached if we through the faith in Christ which is in the Spirit <span
id="fr_1294"></span>[1295](#fn_1294.md) hope that we shall be raised
together with Him and sit together in heavenly places, <span
id="fr_1295"></span>[1296](#fn_1295.md) whenever He shall change our vile
body from the natural to the spiritual, <span
id="fr_1296"></span>[1297](#fn_1296.md) and yet refuse to assign to the
Spirit any share in the sitting together, or in the glory, or anything
else which we have received from Him.  Of all the boons of which, in
accordance with the indefeasible grant of Him who has promised them, we
have believed ourselves worthy, are we to allow none to the Holy Spirit,
as though they were all above His dignity?  It is yours according to
your merit to be “ever with the Lord,” and you expect to be caught up
“in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and to be ever with the
Lord.” <span id="fr_1297"></span>[1298](#fn_1297.md)   You declare the man
who numbers and ranks the Spirit with the Father and the Son to be
guilty of intolerable impiety.  Can you really now deny that the Spirit
is with Christ?

<span id="vii.xxix-p17"></span>70.  I am ashamed to add the rest.  You
expect to be glorified together with Christ; (“if so be that we suffer
with him that we may be also glorified together;” <span
id="fr_1298"></span>[1299](#fn_1298) .md) but you do not glorify the
“Spirit of holiness” <span id="fr_1299"></span>[1300](#fn_1299.md) together
with Christ, as though He were not worthy to receive equal honour even
with you.  You hope to “reign with” <span
id="fr_1300"></span>[1301](#fn_1300.md) Christ; but you “do despite unto
the Spirit of grace” <span id="fr_1301"></span>[1302](#fn_1301.md) by
assigning Him the rank of a slave and a subordinate.  And I say this not
to demonstrate that so much is due to the Spirit in the ascription of
glory, but to prove the unfairness of those who will not ever give so
much as this, and shrink from the fellowship of the Spirit with Son and
Father as from impiety.  Who could touch on these things without a
sigh? <span id="fr_1302"></span>[1303](#fn_1302.md)   Is it not so plain as
to be within the perception even of a child that this present state of
things preludes the threatened eclipse of the faith?  The undeniable has
become the uncertain.  We profess belief in the Spirit, and then we
quarrel with our own confessions.  We are baptized, and begin to fight
again.  We call upon Him as the Prince of Life, and then despise Him as
a slave like ourselves.  We received Him with the Father and the Son,
and we dishonour Him as a part of creation.  Those who “know not what
they ought to pray for,” <span id="fr_1303"></span>[1304](#fn_1303.md) even
though they be induced to utter a word of the Spirit with awe, as though
coming near His dignity, yet prune down all that exceeds the exact
proportion of their speech.  They ought rather to bewail their weakness,
in that we are powerless to express in words our gratitude for the
benefits which we are actually receiving; for He “passes all
understanding,” <span id="fr_1304"></span>[1305](#fn_1304.md) and convicts
speech of its natural inability even to approach His dignity in the
least degree; as it is written in the Book of Wisdom, <span
id="fr_1305"></span>[1306](#fn_1305.md) “Exalt Him as much as you can, for
even yet will He far exceed; and when you exalt Him put forth all your
strength, and be not weary, for you can never go far enough.”  Verily
terrible is the account to be given for words of this kind by you who
have heard from God who cannot lie that for blasphemy against the Holy
Ghost there is no forgiveness. <span
