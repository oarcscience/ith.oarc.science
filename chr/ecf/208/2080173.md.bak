<span id="ix.ci-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.ci-p1.1"></span>Letter C. <span
id="fr_2350"></span>[2351](#fn_2350.md) </span>

<span id="ix.ci-p3"></span>* To Eusebius, Bishop of Samosata*.

<span id="ix.ci-p4"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.ci-p4.1"></span>When</span> I saw your affectionate letter, in
the country bordering on Armenia, it was like a lighted torch held up at
a distance to mariners at sea, especially if the sea happen to be
agitated by the wind.  Your reverence’s letter was of itself a pleasant
one, and full of comfort; but its natural charm was very much enhanced
by the time of its arrival, a time so painful to me, that I hardly know
how to describe it, after once making up my mind to forget its
troubles.  However, my deacon will give you a full account.  My bodily
strength completely failed me, so that I was not even able to bear the
slightest movement without pain.  Nevertheless I do pray that, by the
aid of your prayers, my own longing may be fulfilled; although my
journey has caused me great difficulties, in consequence of the affairs
of my own Church having been neglected through its occupying such a long
time.  But if, while I yet live, God grants me to see your reverence in
my Church, then truly I shall have good hope, even for the future, that
I am not wholly excluded from the gifts of God.  If it be possible, I
beg that this meeting between us may take place at the Synod which we
hold every year, in memory of the blessed martyr Eupsychius, <span
id="fr_2351"></span>[2352](#fn_2351.md) now about to be held on the 7th of
September.  I am compassed with anxieties which demand your help and
sympathy, both in the matter of the appointment of bishops and in the
consideration of the trouble caused me by the simplicity of Gregory of
Nyssa, <span id="fr_2352"></span>[2353](#fn_2352.md) who is summoning a
Synod at Ancyra and leaving nothing undone to counteract me.

<span id="ix.ci-p6"></span> The Ben. note, in answer to the suggested
unlikelihood of Basil’s being plotted against by his brother, calls
attention to the fact that this opposition was due not to want of
affection but to want of tact, and compares *Letter* lviii. on Gregory’s
foolish falsehood about their uncle.
