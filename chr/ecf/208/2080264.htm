<p class="c55"><a name="ix.cxcii-p3"></A><i>To Amphilochius, bishop of Iconium</i>.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2671"></A><A HREF="#fn_2671"><FONT SIZE="1">2672</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p class="c20"><a name="ix.cxcii-p5"></A><span class="c14"><a name="ix.cxcii-p5.1"></A>On</span> reading the letter of your reverence I heartily thanked God.&#160; I did so because I found in your expressions traces of ancient affection.&#160; You are not like the majority.&#160; You did not persist in refusing to begin an affectionate correspondence.&#160; You have learned the greatness of the prize promised to the saints for humility, and so you have chosen, by taking the second place, to get before me.&#160; Among Christians such are the conditions of victory, and it is he who is content to take the second place who wins a crown.&#160; But I must not be behindhand in this virtuous rivalry, and so I thus salute your reverence in return; and inform you as to how I am minded, in that, since agreement in the faith is established among us,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2672"></A><A HREF="#fn_2672"><FONT SIZE="1">2673</FONT></A>
 there is nothing further to prevent our being one body and one spirit, as we have been called in one hope of our calling.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2673"></A><A HREF="#fn_2673"><FONT SIZE="1">2674</FONT></A>
&#160; It is for you, then, of your charity to follow up a good beginning to rally men of like mind to stand at your side, and to appoint both time and place for meeting.&#160; Thus, by God&#146;s grace, through mutual accommodation we may govern the Churches by the ancient kind of love; receiving as our own members brothers coming from the other side, sending as to our kin, and in turn receiving as from our own kin.&#160; Such, indeed, was once the boast of the Church.&#160; Brothers from each Church, travelling from one end of the world to the other, were provided with little tokens, and found all men fathers and brothers.&#160; This is a privilege whereof, like all the rest, the enemy of Christ&#146;s Churches has robbed us.&#160; We are confined each in his own city, and every one looks at his neighbour with distrust.&#160; What more is to be said but that our love has grown cold,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2674"></A><A HREF="#fn_2674"><FONT SIZE="1">2675</FONT></A>
 whereby alone our Lord has told us that His disciples are distinguished?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2675"></A><A HREF="#fn_2675"><FONT SIZE="1">2676</FONT></A>
&#160; First of all, if you will, do you become known to one another, that I may know with whom I am to be in agreement.&#160; Thus by common consent we will fix on some place convenient to both, and, at a season suitable for travelling, we will hasten to meet one another; the Lord will direct us in the way.&#160; Farewell.&#160; Be of good cheer.&#160; Pray for me.&#160; May you be granted to me by the grace of the Holy One?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2676"></A><A HREF="#fn_2676"><FONT SIZE="1">2677</FONT></A>

<p class="endnote"><a name="ix.cxcii-p10"></A> Whether the proposed meeting took place, and, indeed, what meeting is referred to, cannot be determined.&#160; Basil met Amphilochius and some neighbouring bishops in Pisidia in 375.&#160; But before this he counts the Isaurians as already in communion with him (<i>Letter</i> cciv.).&#160; Perhaps all that the meeting was desired to bring about was effected by correspondence.&#160; This is the explanation of the Ben.
