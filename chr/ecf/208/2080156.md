id="ix.lxxxiv-p1.1"></span>Letter LXXXIII. <span
id="fr_2285"></span>[2286](#fn_2285) </span>

<span id="ix.lxxxiv-p3"></span>*To a Magistrate*. <span
id="fr_2286"></span>[2287](#fn_2286)

<span id="ix.lxxxiv-p5"></span>I <span class="c14"><span
id="ix.lxxxiv-p5.1"></span>have</span> had only a short acquaintance and
intercourse with your lordship, but I have no small or contemptible
knowledge of you from the reports through which I am brought into
communication with many men of position and importance.  You yourself
are better able to say whether I, by report, am of any account with
you.  At all events your reputation with me is such as I have said.  But
since God has called you to an occupation which gives you opportunity of
showing kindness, and in the exercise of which it lies in your power to
bring about the restoration of my own city, now level with the ground,
it is, I think, only my duty to remind your excellency that in the hope
of the requital God will give, you should show yourself of such a
character as to win a memory that cannot die, and be made an inheritor
of everlasting rest, in consequence of your making the afflictions of
the distressed hard to bear.  I have a property at Chamanene, and I beg
you to look after its interests as though they were your own.  And pray
do not be surprised at my calling my friend’s property my own, for among
other virtues I have been taught that of friendship, and I remember the
author of the wise saying a friend is another self. <span
id="fr_2287"></span>[2288](#fn_2287)   I therefore commend to your
excellency this property belonging to my friend, as though it were my
own.  I beg you to consider the misfortunes of the house, and both to
grant them consolation for the past, and for the future to make the
place more comfortable for them; for it is now left and abandoned on
account of the weight of the rates imposed upon it.  I will do my best
to meet your excellency and converse with you on points of detail.
