id="ix.cxvi-p5.1"></span>We</span> often ill advisedly hate our
superiors and love our inferiors.  So I, for my part, hold my tongue,
and keep silence about the disgrace of the insults offered me.  I wait
for the Judge above, Who knows how to punish all wickedness in the end,
even though a man pour out gold like sand; let him trample on the right,
he does but hurt his own soul.  God always asks for sacrifice, not, I
think, because He needs it, but because He accepts a pious and right
mind as a precious sacrifice.  But when a man by his transgressions
tramples on himself God reckons his prayers impure.  Bethink thyself,
then, of the last day, and pray do not try to teach me.  I know more
than you do, and am not so choked with thorns within.  I do not mind
tenfold wickedness with a few good qualities.  You have stirred up
against me lizards and toads, <span id="fr_2388"></span>[2389](#fn_2388.md)
<span id="page_191">p. 191</span> <span

nevertheless unclean.  But a bird will come from above who will devour
them.  The account I have to render is not according to your ideas, but
as God thinks fit to judge.  If witnesses are wanted, there will not
stand before the Judge slaves; nor yet a disgraceful and detestable set
of eunuchs; neither woman nor man, lustful, envious, ill-bribed,
passionate, effeminate, slaves of the belly, mad for gold, ruthless,
grumbling about their dinner, inconstant, stingy, greedy, insatiable,
savage, jealous.  What more need I say?  At their very birth they were
condemned to the knife.  How can their mind be right when their feet are
awry?  They are chaste because of the knife, and it is no credit to
them.  They are lecherous to no purpose, of their own natural vileness. 
These are not the witnesses who shall stand in the judgment, but rather
the eyes of the just and the eyesight of the perfect, of all who are
then to see with their eyes what they now see with their understanding.

<span id="ix.cxvi-p4"></span> The Ben. E. note that in the imperial
codex No. lxvii. appears an argument of this letter wanting in the
editions of St. Basil.  It is as follows:  “Letter of the same to
Simplicia about her eunuchs.  She was a heretic.  The blessed Basil
being ill and entering a bath to bathe, Simplicia told her eunuchs and
maids to throw his towels out.  Straightway the just judgment of God
slew some of them, and Simplicia sent money to the blessed Basil to make
amends for the injury.  Basil refused to receive it, and wrote this
Letter.”  This extraordinary preface seems to have been written by some
annotator ignorant of the circumstances, which may be learnt from Greg.
Naz. *Letter* xxxviii.  It appears that a certain Cappadocian church,
long without a bishop, had elected a slave of Simplicia, a lady wealthy
and munificent, but of suspected orthodoxy.  Basil and Gregory
injudiciously ordained the reluctant slave without waiting for his
mistress’s consent.  The angry lady wrote in indignation, and threatened
him with the vengeance of her slaves and eunuchs.  After Basil’s death
she returned to the charge, and pressed Gregory to get the ordination
annulled.  *cf*. Maran, *Vit. Bas*. chap. xxv.

<span id="ix.cxvi-p6"></span> Presumably the slaves and eunuchs
mentioned below.  If the letter is genuine it is wholly unworthy of the
Archbishop of Cæsarea.
