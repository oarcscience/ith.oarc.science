<span id="ix.cxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.cxvii-p1.1"></span>Letter CXVI. <span
id="fr_2389"></span>[2390](#fn_2389.md) </span>

<span id="ix.cxvii-p3"></span>*To Firminius*. <span
id="fr_2390"></span>[2391](#fn_2390.md)

<span id="ix.cxvii-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cxvii-p5.1"></span>You</span> write seldom, and your letters are
short, either because you shrink from writing or from avoiding the
satiety that comes from excess; or perhaps to train yourself to curt
speech.  I, indeed, am never satisfied and however abundant be your
communication, it is less than my desire, because I wish to know every
detail about you.  How are you as to health?  How as to ascetic
discipline?  Do you persevere in your original purpose?  Or have you
formed some new plan, changing your mind according to circumstances? 
Had you remained the same, I should not have wanted a great number of
letters.  I should have been quite satisfied with “I am quite well and I
hope you are quite well.”  But I hear what I am ashamed to say, that you
have deserted the ranks of your blessed forefathers, and deserted to
your paternal grandfather, and are anxious to be rather a Brettanius
than a Firminius.  I am very anxious to hear about this, and to learn
the reasons which have induced you to take to this kind of life.  You
have yourself been silent; ashamed, I suppose, of your intentions, and
therefore I must implore you not to entertain any project, which can be
associated with shame.  If any such idea has entered into your mind, put
it from you, come to yourself again, bid a long farewell to soldiering
and arms and the toils of the camp.  Return home thinking it, as your
forefathers thought before you, quite enough for ease of life and all
possible distinction to hold a high place in your city.  This, I am
sure, you will be able to achieve without difficulty, when I consider
your natural gifts and the small number of your rivals.  If, then, this
was not your original intention, or if after forming it you have
rejected it, let me know at once.  If, on the other hand, which God
forbid, you remain in the same mind, let the trouble come self
announced.  I do not want a letter.
