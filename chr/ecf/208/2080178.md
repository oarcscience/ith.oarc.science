<span id="ix.cvi-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.cvi-p1.1"></span>Letter CV. <span
id="fr_2364"></span>[2365](#fn_2364) </span>

<span id="ix.cvi-p3"></span>*To the deaconesses, the daughters of Count
Terentius*. <span id="fr_2365"></span>[2366](#fn_2365)

<span id="ix.cvi-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cvi-p5.1"></span>On</span> coming to Samosata I expected to have
the pleasure of meeting your excellencies, and when I was disappointed I
could not easily bear it.  When, I said, will it be possible for me to
be in your neighbourhood again?  When will it be agreeable to you to
come into mine?  All this, however, must be left to the Lord’s will.  As
to the present, when I found that my son Sophronius was setting out to
you, I gladly delivered him this letter, to convey you my salutation,
and to tell you how, by God’s grace, I do not cease to remember you, and
to thank the Lord on your behalf, in that you are goodly scions of a
goodly stock, fruitful in good works, and verily like lilies among
thorns.  Surrounded as you are by the terrible perversity of them that
are corrupting the word of truth, you do not give in to their wiles; you
have not abandoned the apostolic proclamation of faith, you have not
gone over to the successful novelty of the day.  Is not this cause of
deep thankfulness to God?  Shall not this rightly bring you great
renown?  You have professed your faith in Father, Son and Holy Ghost. 
Do not abandon this deposit; the Father—origin of all; the Son—Only
begotten, begotten of Him, very God, Perfect of Perfect, living image,
shewing the whole Father in Himself; the Holy Ghost, having His
subsistence of God, the fount of holiness, power that gives life, grace
that maketh perfect, through Whom man is adopted, and the mortal made
immortal, conjoined with Father and Son in all things in glory and
eternity, in power and kingdom, in sovereignty and godhead; as is
testified by the tradition of the baptism of salvation.

<span id="ix.cvi-p6"></span>But all who maintain that either Son or
Spirit is a creature, or absolutely reduce the Spirit to ministerial and
servile rank, are far removed from the truth.  Flee their communion. 
Turn away from their teaching.  They are destructive to souls.  If ever
the Lord grant us to meet, I will discourse to you further concerning
the faith, to the end that you may perceive at once the power of the
truth and the rottenness of heresy by Scriptural proof.
