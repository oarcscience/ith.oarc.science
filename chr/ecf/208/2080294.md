id="ix.ccxxii-p1.1"></span>Letter CCXXI. <span
id="fr_2870"></span>[2871](#fn_2870) </span>

<span id="ix.ccxxii-p3"></span>To the Beræans.

<span id="ix.ccxxii-p4"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.ccxxii-p4.1"></span>You</span> were previously known to me, my
dear friends, by your far-famed piety, and by the crown won by your
confession in Christ.  Peradventure one of you may ask in reply who can
have carried these tidings of us so far?  The Lord Himself; for He puts
His worshippers like a lamp on a lamp-stand, and makes them shine
throughout the whole world.  Are not winners in the games wont to be
made famous by the prize of victory, and craftsmen by the skilful design
of their work?  Shall the memory of these and others like them abide for
ever unforgotten, and shall not Christ’s worshippers concerning whom the
Lord says Himself, Them that honour me I will honour, be made famous and
glorious by Him before all?  Shall He not display the brightness of
their radiant splendour as He does the beams of the sun?  But I have
been moved to greater longing for you by the letter which you have been
good enough to send me, a letter in which, above and beyond your former
efforts on behalf of the truth, you have been yet more lavish of your
abounding and vigorous zeal for the true faith.  In all this I rejoice
with you, and I pray with you that the God of the universe, Whose is the
struggle and the arena, and Who gives the crown, may fill you with
enthusiasm, may make your souls strong, and make your work such as to
meet with His divine approval.
