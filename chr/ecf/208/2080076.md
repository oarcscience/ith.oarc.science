<span id="ix.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.iv-p1.1"></span>Letter III. <span
id="fr_1756"></span>[1757](#fn_1756) </span>

<span id="ix.iv-p3"></span>*To Candidianus*. <span
id="fr_1757"></span>[1758](#fn_1757)

<span id="ix.iv-p5"></span>1.  <span class="c14"><span
id="ix.iv-p5.1"></span>When</span> I took your letter into my hand, I
underwent an experience worth telling.  I looked at it with the awe due
to a document making some state announcement, and as I was breaking the
wax, I felt a dread greater than ever guilty Spartan felt at sight of
the Laconian scytale. <span id="fr_1758"></span>[1759](#fn_1758)

<span id="ix.iv-p7"></span>When, however, I had opened the letter, and
read it through, I could not help laughing, partly for joy at finding
nothing alarming in it; partly because I likened your state of affairs
to that of Demosthenes.  Demosthenes, you remember, when he was
providing for a certain little company of chorus dancers and musicians,
requested to be styled no longer Demosthenes, but “choragus.” <span
id="fr_1759"></span>[1760](#fn_1759)   You are always the same, whether
playing the “choragus” or not.  “Choragus” you are indeed to soldiers
myriads more in number than the individuals to whom De<span
id="page_113">p. 113</span> <span id="ix.iv-Page_113"></span>mosthenes
supplied necessaries; and yet you do not when you write to me stand on
your dignity, but keep up the old style.  You do not give up the study
of literature, but, as Plato <span id="fr_1760"></span>[1761](#fn_1760)
has it, in the midst of the storm and tempest of affairs, you stand
aloof, as it were, under some strong wall, and keep your mind clear of
all disturbance; nay, more, as far as in you lies, you do not even let
others be disturbed.  Such is your life; great and wonderful to all who
have eyes to see; and yet not wonderful to any one who judges by the
whole purpose of your life.

<span id="ix.iv-p10"></span>Now let me tell my own story, extraordinary
indeed, but only what might have been expected.

<span id="ix.iv-p11"></span>2.  One of the hinds who live with us here
at Annesi, <span id="fr_1761"></span>[1762](#fn_1761) on the death of my
servant, without alleging any breach of contract with him, without
approaching me, without making any complaint, without asking me to make
him any voluntary payment, without any threat of violence should he fail
to get it, all on a sudden, with certain mad fellows like himself,
attacked my house, brutally assaulted the women who were in charge of
it, broke in the doors, and after appropriating some of the contents
himself, and promising the rest to any one who liked, carried off
everything.  I do not wish to be regarded as the *ne plus ultra* of
helplessness, and a suitable object for the violence of any one who
likes to attack me.  Shew me, then, now, I beg you, that kindly interest
which you have always shewn in my affairs.  Only on one condition can my
tranquillity be secured,—that I be assured of having your energy on my
side.  It would be quite punishment enough, from my point of view, if
the man were apprehended by the district magistrate and locked up for a
short period in the gaol.  It is not only that I am indignant at the
treatment I have suffered, but I want security for the future.

dispatches.  The strip of leather on which the communication was to be
made is said to have been rolled slantwise round it, and the message was
then written lengthwise.  The correspondent was said to have a staff of
a size exactly corresponding, and so by rewinding the strip could read
what was written.  *Vide* Aulus Gellius xvii. 9.
