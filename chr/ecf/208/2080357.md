id="ix.cclxxxv-p1.1"></span>Letter CCLXXXIV. <span
id="fr_3242"></span>[3243](#fn_3242.md) </span>

<span id="ix.cclxxxv-p3"></span>To the assessor in the case of monks.

<span id="ix.cclxxxv-p4"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cclxxxv-p4.1"></span>Concerning</span> the monks, your excellency
has, I believe, already rules in force, so that I need ask for no
special favour on their behalf.

<span id="ix.cclxxxv-p5"></span>It is enough that they share with others
the enjoyment of your general beneficence; still I feel it incumbent
upon me too to interest myself in their case.  I therefore submit it to
your more perfect judgment, <span id="page_313">p. 313</span> <span
id="ix.cclxxxv-Page_313"></span>that men who have long since taken leave
of this life, who have mortified their own bodies, so that they have
neither money to spend nor bodily service to render in the interests of
the common weal, should be exempted from taxation.  For if their lives
are consistent with their profession, they possess neither money nor
bodies; for the former is spent in communicating to the needy; while
their bodies are worn away in prayer and fasting.

<span id="ix.cclxxxv-p6"></span>Men living such lives you will, I know,
regard with special reverence; nay you will wish to secure their
intervention, since by their life in the Gospel they are able to prevail
with God.
