<span id="vii.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vii.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XV.</span>

<span id="vii.xvi-p2"></span>Reply to the suggested objection that we
are baptized “into water.”  Also concerning baptism.

<span id="vii.xvi-p3"></span>34.  <span class="c14"><span
id="vii.xvi-p3.1"></span>What</span> more?  Verily, our opponents are
well equipped with arguments.  We are baptized, they urge, into water,
and of course we shall not honour the water above all creation, or give
it a share of the honour of the Father and of the Son.  The arguments of
these men are such as might be expected from angry disputants, leaving
no means untried in their attack on him who has offended them, because
their reason is clouded over by their feelings.  We will not, however,
shrink from the discussion even of these points.  If we do not teach the
ignorant, at least we shall not turn away before evil doers.  But let us
for a moment retrace our steps.

<span id="vii.xvi-p4"></span>35.  The dispensation of our God and
Saviour concerning man is a recall from the fall and a return from the
alienation caused by disobedience to close communion with God.  This is
the reason for the sojourn of Christ in the flesh, the pattern life
described in the Gospels, the sufferings, the cross, the tomb, the
resurrection; so that the man who is being saved through imitation of
Christ receives that old adoption.  For perfection of life the imitation
of Christ is necessary, not only in the example of gentleness, <span
id="fr_1003"></span>[1004](#fn_1003.md) lowliness, and long suffering set
us in His life, but also of His actual death.  So Paul, the imitator of
Christ, <span id="fr_1004"></span>[1005](#fn_1004.md) says, “being made
conformable unto his death; if by any means I might attain unto the
resurrection of the dead.” <span id="fr_1005"></span>[1006](#fn_1005.md)  
How then are we made in the likeness of His death? <span
id="fr_1006"></span>[1007](#fn_1006.md)   In that we were buried <span
id="fr_1007"></span>[1008](#fn_1007.md) with Him by baptism.  What then is
the manner of the burial?  And what is the advantage resulting from the
imitation?  First of all, it is necessary that the continuity of the old
life be cut.  And this is impossible less a man be born again, according
to the Lord’s word; <span id="fr_1008"></span>[1009](#fn_1008.md) for the
regeneration, as indeed the name shews, is a beginning of a second
life.  So before beginning the second, it is necessary to put an end to
the first.  For just as in the case of runners who turn and take the
second course, <span id="fr_1009"></span>[1010](#fn_1009.md) a kind of halt
and pause intervenes between the movements in the opposite direction, so
also in making a change in lives it seemed necessary for death to come
as mediator between the two, ending all that goes before, and beginning
all that comes after.  How then do we achieve the descent into hell?  By
imitating, through baptism, the burial of Christ.  For the bodies of the
baptized are, as it were, buried in the water.  Baptism then
symbolically signifies the putting off of the works of the flesh; as the
apostle says, ye were “circumcised with the circumcision made without
hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the
circumcision of Christ; buried with him in baptism.” <span
id="fr_1010"></span>[1011](#fn_1010.md)   <span id="page_22">p. 22</span>
<span id="vii.xvi-Page_22"></span>And there is, as it were, a cleansing
of the soul from the filth <span id="fr_1011"></span>[1012](#fn_1011.md)
that has grown on it from the carnal mind, <span
id="fr_1012"></span>[1013](#fn_1012.md) as it is written, “Thou shalt wash
me, and I shall be whiter than snow.” <span
id="fr_1013"></span>[1014](#fn_1013.md)   On this account we do not, as is
the fashion of the Jews, wash ourselves at each defilement, but own the
baptism of salvation <span id="fr_1014"></span>[1015](#fn_1014.md) to be
one. <span id="fr_1015"></span>[1016](#fn_1015.md)   For there the death on
behalf of the world is one, and one the resurrection of the dead,
whereof baptism is a type.  For this cause the Lord, who is the
Dispenser of our life, gave us the covenant of baptism, containing a
type of life and death, for the water fulfils the image of death, and
the Spirit gives us the earnest of life.  Hence it follows that the
answer to our question why the water was associated with the
Spirit <span id="fr_1016"></span>[1017](#fn_1016.md) is clear:  the reason
is because in baptism two ends were proposed; on the one hand, the
destroying of the body of sin, <span
id="fr_1017"></span>[1018](#fn_1017.md) that it may never bear fruit unto
death; <span id="fr_1018"></span>[1019](#fn_1018.md) on the other hand, our
living unto the Spirit, <span id="fr_1019"></span>[1020](#fn_1019.md) and
having our fruit in holiness; <span id="fr_1020"></span>[1021](#fn_1020.md)
the water receiving the body as in a tomb figures death, while the
Spirit pours in the quickening power, renewing our souls from the
deadness of sin unto their original life.  This then is what it is to be
born again of water and of the Spirit, the being made dead being
effected in the water, while our life is wrought in us through the
Spirit.  In three immersions, <span id="fr_1021"></span>[1022](#fn_1021.md)
then, and with three invocations, the great mystery of baptism is
performed, to the end that the type of death may be fully figured, and
that by the tradition of the divine knowledge the baptized may have
their souls enlightened.  It follows that if there is any grace in the
water, it is not of the nature of the water, but of the presence of the
Spirit.  For baptism is “not the putting away of the filth of the flesh,
but the answer of a good conscience towards God.” <span
id="fr_1022"></span>[1023](#fn_1022.md)   So in training us for the life
that follows on the resurrection the Lord sets out all the manner of
life required by the Gospel, laying down for us the law of gentleness,
of endurance of wrong, of freedom from the defilement that comes of the
love of pleasure, and from covetousness, to the end that we may of set
purpose win beforehand and achieve all that the life to come of its
inherent nature possesses.  If therefore any one in attempting a
definition were to describe the gospel as a forecast of the life that
follows on the resurrection, he would not seem to me to go beyond what
is meet and right.  Let us now return to our main topic.

<span id="vii.xvi-p25"></span>36.  Through the Holy Spirit comes our
restoration to paradise, our ascension into the kingdom of heaven, our
return to the adoption of sons, our liberty to call God our Father, our
being made partakers of the grace of Christ, our being called children
of light, our sharing in eternal glory, and, in a word, our being
brought into a state of all “fulness of blessing,” <span
id="fr_1023"></span>[1024](#fn_1023.md) both in this world and in the world
to come, of all the good gifts that are in store for us, by promise
hereof, through faith, beholding the reflection of their grace as though
they were already present, we await the full enjoyment.  If such is the
earnest, what the perfection?  If such the first fruits, what the
complete fulfilment?  Furthermore, from this too may be apprehended the
difference between the grace that comes from the Spirit and the baptism
by water:  in that John indeed baptized with water, but our Lord Jesus
Christ by the Holy Ghost.  “I indeed,” he says, “baptize you with water
unto repentance; but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose
shoes I am not worthy to bear:  he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost
and with fire.” <span id="fr_1024"></span>[1025](#fn_1024.md)   Here He
calls the trial at the judgment the baptism of fire, as the apostle
says, “The fire shall try every man’s work, of what sort it is.” <span
id="fr_1025"></span>[1026](#fn_1025.md)   And again, “The day shall declare
it, because it shall be revealed by fire.” <span
id="fr_1026"></span>[1027](#fn_1026.md)   And ere now there have been some
who in their championship of true religion have undergone the death for
Christ’s sake, not in mere similitude, but in actual fact, and so have
needed none of the outward signs of water for their salvation, because
they were baptized in their own blood. <span
id="fr_1027"></span>[1028](#fn_1027.md)   Thus I write <span
id="page_23">p. 23</span> <span id="vii.xvi-Page_23"></span>not to
disparage the baptism by water, but to overthrow the arguments <span
id="fr_1028"></span>[1029](#fn_1028.md) of those who exalt themselves
against the Spirit; who confound things that are distinct from one
another, and compare those which admit of no comparison.

<span id="vii.xvi-p23"></span> Trine immersion was the universal rule of
the Catholic Church.  *cf*. Greg. Nyss. *The Great Catechism*, p. 502 of
this edition.  So Tertull. *de Cor. Mil*. c iii., *Aquam adituri,
ibidem, sed et aliquanto prius in ecclesia, sub antistitis manu
contestamur, nos renuntiare diabolo et pompæ et angelis ejus.  Dehinc
ter mergitamur*.  Sozomen (vi. 26) says that Eunomius was alleged to be
the first to maintain that baptism ought to be performed in one
immersion and to corrupt in this manner the tradition of the apostles,
and Theodoret (Hæret. fab. iv. 3) describes Eunomius as abandoning the
trine immersion, and also the invocation of the Trinity as baptizing
into the death of Christ.  Jeremy Taylor (*Ductor dubitantium*, iii. 4,
Sect. 13) says, “In England we have a custom of sprinkling, and that but
once.…As to the number, though the Church of England hath made no law,
and therefore the custom of doing it once is the more indifferent and at
liberty, yet if the trine immersion be agreeable to the analogy of the
mystery, and the other be not, the custom ought not to prevail, and is
not to be complied with, if the case be evident or declared.”

Jerusalem (*Cat. Lect*. iii. 10), “If a man receive not baptism, he has
not salvation; excepting only the martyrs, even who without the water
receive the kingdom.  For when the Saviour was ransoming the world
through the cross, and was pierced in the side, He gave forth blood and
water, that some in times of peace should be baptized in water; others
in time of persecution, in their own blood.”  So Tertullian (*In
Valentin*. ii.) of the Holy Innocents, “baptized in blood for Jesus’
sake” (Keble), “*testimonium Christi sanguine litavere*.”
