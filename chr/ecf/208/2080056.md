<span id="vii.xxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vii.xxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVI.</span>

<span id="vii.xxvii-p2"></span>That the word “in,” in as many senses as
it bears, is understood of the Spirit.

<span id="vii.xxvii-p3"></span>61.  <span class="c14"><span
id="vii.xxvii-p3.1"></span>Now</span>, short and simple as this
utterance is, it appears to me, as I consider it, that its meanings are
many and various.  For of the senses in which “*in*” is used, we find
that all help our conceptions of the Spirit.  *Form* is said to be *in
Matter*; *Power* to be *in* what is capable of it; *Habit* to be *in*
him who is affected by it; and so on. <span
id="fr_1228"></span>[1229](#fn_1228.md)   Therefore, inasmuch as the Holy
Spirit perfects rational beings, completing their excellence, He is
analogous to Form.  For he, who no longer “lives after the flesh,” <span
id="fr_1229"></span>[1230](#fn_1229.md) but, being “led by the Spirit of
God,” <span id="fr_1230"></span>[1231](#fn_1230.md) is called a Son of God,
being “conformed to the image of the Son of God,” <span
id="fr_1231"></span>[1232](#fn_1231.md) is described as spiritual.  And as
is the power of seeing in the healthy eye, so is the operation of the
Spirit in the purified soul.  Wherefore also Paul prays for the
Ephesians that they may have their “eyes enlightened” by “the Spirit of
wisdom.” <span id="fr_1232"></span>[1233](#fn_1232.md)   And as the art in
him who has acquired it, so is the grace of the Spirit in the recipient
ever present, though not continuously in operation.  For as the art is
potentially in the artist, but only in operation when he is working in
accordance with it, so also the Spirit is ever present with those that
are worthy, but works, as need requires, in prophecies, or in healings,
or in some other actual carrying into effect of His potential
action. <span id="fr_1233"></span>[1234](#fn_1233.md)   Furthermore as in
our bodies is health, or heat, or, generally, their variable conditions,
so, very frequently is the Spirit in the soul; since He does not abide
with those who, on account of the instability of their will, easily
reject the grace which they have received.  An instance of this is seen
in Saul, <span id="fr_1234"></span>[1235](#fn_1234.md) and the seventy
elders of the children of Israel, except Eldad and Medad, with whom
alone the Spirit appears to have remained, <span
id="fr_1235"></span>[1236](#fn_1235.md) and, generally, any one similar to
these in character.  And like reason in the soul, which is at one time
the thought in the heart, and at another speech uttered by the
tongue, <span id="fr_1236"></span>[1237](#fn_1236.md) so is the Holy
Spirit, as when He “beareth witness with our spirit,” <span
id="fr_1237"></span>[1238](#fn_1237.md) and when He “cries in our hearts,
Abba, Father,” <span id="fr_1238"></span>[1239](#fn_1238.md) or when He
speaks on our behalf, as it is said, “It is not ye that speak, but the
Spirit of our Father which speaketh in you.” <span
id="fr_1239"></span>[1240](#fn_1239.md)   Again, the Spirit is conceived
of, in relation to the distribution of gifts, as a whole in parts.  For
we all are “members one of another, having gifts differing according to
the grace that is given us.” <span id="fr_1240"></span>[1241](#fn_1240.md)
  Wherefore “the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of thee; nor
again the head to the feet, I have no need of you,” <span
id="fr_1241"></span>[1242](#fn_1241.md) but all together complete the Body
of Christ in the Unity of the Spirit, and render to one another the
needful aid that comes of the gifts.  “But God hath set the members in
the body, <span id="page_39">p. 39</span> <span
id="vii.xxvii-Page_39"></span>every one of them, as it hath pleased
Him.” <span id="fr_1242"></span>[1243](#fn_1242.md)   But “the members have
the same care for one another,” <span
id="fr_1243"></span>[1244](#fn_1243.md) according to the inborn spiritual
communion of their sympathy.  Wherefore, “whether one member suffer, all
the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members
rejoice with it.” <span id="fr_1244"></span>[1245](#fn_1244.md)   And as
parts in the whole so are we individually in the Spirit, because we all
“were baptized in one body into one spirit.” <span
id="fr_1245"></span>[1246](#fn_1245.md)

<span id="vii.xxvii-p22"></span>62.  It is an extraordinary statement,
but it is none the less true, that the Spirit is frequently spoken of as
the *place* of them that are being sanctified, and it will become
evident that even by this figure the Spirit, so far from being degraded,
is rather glorified.  For words applicable to the body are, for the sake
of clearness, frequently transferred in scripture to spiritual
conceptions.  Accordingly we find the Psalmist, even in reference to
God, saying “Be Thou to me a champion God and a strong place to save
me” <span id="fr_1246"></span>[1247](#fn_1246.md) and concerning the Spirit
“behold there is place by me, and stand upon a rock.” <span
id="fr_1247"></span>[1248](#fn_1247.md)   Plainly meaning the place or
contemplation in the Spirit wherein, after Moses had entered thither, he
was able to see God intelligibly manifested to him.  This is the special
and peculiar place of true worship; for it is said “Take heed to thyself
that thou offer not thy burnt offerings in every place…but in the place
the Lord thy God shall choose.” <span
id="fr_1248"></span>[1249](#fn_1248.md)   Now what is a spiritual burnt
offering?  “The sacrifice of praise.” <span
id="fr_1249"></span>[1250](#fn_1249.md)   And in what place do we offer
it?  In the Holy Spirit.  Where have we learnt this?  From the Lord
himself in the words “The true worshippers shall worship the Father in
spirit and in truth.” <span id="fr_1250"></span>[1251](#fn_1250.md)   This
place Jacob saw and said “The Lord is in this place.” <span
id="fr_1251"></span>[1252](#fn_1251.md)   It follows that the Spirit is
verily the place of the saints and the saint is the proper place for the
Spirit, offering himself as he does for the indwelling of God, and
called God’s Temple. <span id="fr_1252"></span>[1253](#fn_1252.md)   So
Paul speaks in Christ, saying “In the sight of God we speak in
Christ,” <span id="fr_1253"></span>[1254](#fn_1253.md) and Christ in Paul,
as he himself says “Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in
me.” <span id="fr_1254"></span>[1255](#fn_1254.md)   So also in the Spirit
he speaketh mysteries, <span id="fr_1255"></span>[1256](#fn_1255.md) and
again the Spirit speaks in him. <span
id="fr_1256"></span>[1257](#fn_1256.md)

<span id="vii.xxvii-p34"></span>63.  In relation to the originate, <span
id="fr_1257"></span>[1258](#fn_1257.md) then, the Spirit is said to *be in*
them “in divers portions and in divers manners,” <span
id="fr_1258"></span>[1259](#fn_1258.md) while in relation to the Father and
the Son it is more consistent with true religion to assert Him not to
*be in* but to *be with*.  For the grace flowing from Him when He dwells
in those that are worthy, and carries out His own operations, is well
described as existing in those that are able to receive Him.  On the
other hand His essential existence before the ages, and His ceaseless
abiding with Son and Father, cannot be contemplated without requiring
titles expressive of eternal conjunction.  For absolute and real
co-existence is predicated in the case of things which are mutually
inseparable.  We say, for instance, that heat exists in the hot iron,
but in the case of the actual fire it co-exists; and, similarly, that
health exists in the body, but that life co-exists with the soul.  It
follows that wherever the fellowship is intimate, congenital, <span
id="fr_1259"></span>[1260](#fn_1259.md) and inseparable, the word *with* is
more expressive, suggesting, as it does, the idea of inseparable
fellowship.  Where on the other hand the grace flowing from the Spirit
naturally comes and goes, it is properly and truly said to exist *in*,
even if on account of the firmness of the recipients’ disposition to
good the grace abides with them continually.  Thus whenever we have in
mind the Spirit’s proper rank, we contemplate Him as being *with* the
Father and the Son, but when we think of the grace that <span
id="page_40">p. 40</span> <span id="vii.xxvii-Page_40"></span>flows from
Him operating on those who participate in it, we say that the Spirit is
*in* us.  And the doxology which we offer “in the Spirit” is not an
acknowledgment of His rank; it is rather a confession of our own
weakness, while we shew that we are not sufficient to glorify Him of
ourselves, but our sufficiency <span
id="fr_1260"></span>[1261](#fn_1260.md) is in the Holy Spirit.  Enabled in,
\[or by,\] Him we render thanks to our God for the benefits we have
received, according to the measure of our purification from evil, as we
receive one a larger and another a smaller share of the aid of the
Spirit, that we may offer “the sacrifice of praise to God.” <span
id="fr_1261"></span>[1262](#fn_1261.md)   According to one use, then, it is
thus that we offer our thanksgiving, as the true religion requires, in
the Spirit; although it is not quite unobjectionable that any one should
testify of himself “the Spirit of God is in me, and I offer glory after
being made wise through the grace that flows from Him.”  For to a Paul
it is becoming to say “I think also that I have the Spirit of
God,” <span id="fr_1262"></span>[1263](#fn_1262.md) and again, “that good
thing which was committed to thee keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth
in us.” <span id="fr_1263"></span>[1264](#fn_1263.md)   And of Daniel it is
fitting to say that “the Holy Spirit of God is in him,” <span
id="fr_1264"></span>[1265](#fn_1264.md) and similarly of men who are like
these in virtue.

<span id="vii.xxvii-p44"></span>64.  Another sense may however be given
to the phrase, that just as the Father is seen in the Son, so is the Son
in the Spirit.  The “worship in the Spirit” suggests the idea of the
operation of our intelligence being carried on in the light, as may be
learned from the words spoken to the woman of Samaria.  Deceived as she
was by the customs of her country into the belief that worship was
local, our Lord, with the object of giving her better instruction, said
that worship ought to be offered “in Spirit and in Truth,” <span
id="fr_1265"></span>[1266](#fn_1265.md) plainly meaning by the Truth,
Himself.  As then we speak of the worship offered in the Image of God
the Father as worship in the Son, so too do we speak of worship in the
Spirit as shewing in Himself the Godhead of the Lord.  Wherefore even in
our worship the Holy Spirit is inseparable from the Father and the Son. 
If you remain outside the Spirit you will not be able even to worship at
all; and on your becoming in Him you will in no wise be able to dissever
Him from God;—any more than you will divorce light from visible
objects.  For it is impossible to behold the Image of the invisible God
except by the enlightenment of the Spirit, and impracticable for him to
fix his gaze on the Image to dissever the light from the Image, because
the cause of vision is of necessity seen at the same time as the visible
objects.  Thus fitly and consistently do we behold the “Brightness of
the glory” of God by means of the illumination of the Spirit, and by
means of the “Express Image” we are led up to Him of whom He is the
Express Image and Seal, graven to the like. <span

<span id="vii.xxvii-p35"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xxvii-p35.1"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xxvii-p35.2"></span>ν τοῦς γενητοῖς</span>, as in the Bodleian
<span class="c14"><span id="vii.xxvii-p35.3"></span>ms.</span>  The
Benedictine text adopts the common reading <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xxvii-p35.4"></span>γεννητοις</span>, with the note, “*Sed
discrimen illud parvi momenti*.”  If St. Basil wrote <span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.xxvii-p35.5"></span>γεννητοῖς</span>, he
used it in the looser sense of mortal:  in its strict sense of
“begotten” it would be singularly out of place here, as the antithesis
of the reference to the Son, who is <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xxvii-p35.6"></span>γεννητός</span>, would be spoilt.  In the
terminology of theology, so far from being “*parvi momenti*,” the
distinction is vital.  In the earlier Greek philosophy <span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.xxvii-p35.7"></span>ἀ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.xxvii-p35.8"></span>γένητος</span> and <span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.xxvii-p35.9"></span>ἀ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.xxvii-p35.10"></span>γέννητος</span> are
both used as nearly synonymous to express unoriginate eternal.  *cf*.
Plat., *Phæd*. 245 D., <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xxvii-p35.11"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xxvii-p35.12"></span>ρχὴ δὲ ἀγένητόν</span>, with Plat., *Tim*.
52 A., <span class="Greek"><span id="vii.xxvii-p35.13"></span>Τουτων δὲ
οὕτως ἐχόντων ὁμολογητέον ἓν μὲν εἶναι τὸ κατὰ ταὐτὰ εἶδος ἔχον
ἀγέννητον καὶ ἀνώλεθρον</span>.  And the earliest patristic use
similarly meant by <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xxvii-p35.14"></span>γεννητός</span> and <span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.xxvii-p35.15"></span>ἀ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.xxvii-p35.16"></span>γέννητος</span> created
and uncreated, as in Ign., *Ad Eph*. vii., where our Lord is called
<span class="Greek"><span id="vii.xxvii-p35.17"></span>γεννητὸς καὶ
ἀγέννητος, ἐν ἀνθρ</span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xxvii-p35.18"></span>?</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xxvii-p35.19"></span>πω Θεὸς, ἐν θανάτῳ ζωὴ ἀληθινή</span>. 
*cf*. Bp. Lightfoot’s note.  But “such language is not in accordance
with later theological definitions, which carefully distinguished
between <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xxvii-p35.20"></span>γενητός</span> and <span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.xxvii-p35.21"></span>γεννητός,</span>
between <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xxvii-p35.22"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xxvii-p35.23"></span>γένητος</span> and <span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.xxvii-p35.24"></span>ἀ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.xxvii-p35.25"></span>γέννητος</span>; so
that <span class="Greek"><span id="vii.xxvii-p35.26"></span>γενητός,
ἀγένητος</span>, respectively denied and affirmed the eternal existence,
being equivalent to <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xxvii-p35.27"></span>κτιστός, ἄκτιστος</span>, while <span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.xxvii-p35.28"></span>γεννητός,
ἀγέννητος</span> described certain ontological relations, whether in
time or in eternity.  In the later theological language, therefore, the
Son was <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xxvii-p35.29"></span>γεννητός</span> even in His Godhead.  See
esp. Joann. Damasc., *De Fid. Orth*. i. 8 (I. p. 135, Lequin), <span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.xxvii-p35.30"></span>χρὴ γὰρ εἰδέναι ὅτι τὸ
ἀγένητον, διὰ τοῦ ἑνὸς ν γραφόμενον, τὸ ἄκτιστον ἢ τὸ μὴ γενόμενον
σημαίνει, τὸ δὲ ἀγέννητον, διὰ τῶν δύο νν γραφόμενον, δηλοῖ τὸ μὴ
γεννηθέν</span>; whence he draws the conclusion that <span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.xxvii-p35.31"></span>μόνος ὁ πατὴρ
ἀγέννητος</span> and <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xxvii-p35.32"></span>μόνος ὁ υἱ& 232·ς γεννητός</span>.”  Bp.
Lightfoot, *Ap. Fathers*, Pt. II. Vol. II. p. 90, where the history of
the worlds is exhaustively discussed.  At the time of the Arian
controversy the Catholic disputants were chary of employing these terms,
because of the base uses to which their opponents put them; so St.
Basil, *Contra Eunom*. iv. protests against the Arian argument <span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.xxvii-p35.33"></span>εἰ ἀγέννητος ὁ πατὴρ
γεννητὸς δὲ ὁ υἱ& 232·ς, οὐ τῆς αὐτῆς οὐσιας</span>.
