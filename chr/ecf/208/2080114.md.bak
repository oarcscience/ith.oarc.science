<span id="ix.xlii-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.xlii-p1.1"></span>Letter XLI. <span
id="fr_2056"></span>[2057](#fn_2056.md) </span>

<span id="ix.xlii-p3"></span>*Basil to Julian*.

<span id="ix.xlii-p4"></span>1.  <span class="c14"><span
id="ix.xlii-p4.1"></span>The</span> heroic deeds of your present
splendour are small, and your grand attack against me, or rather against
yourself, is paltry.  When I think of you robed in purple, a crown on
your dishonoured head, which, so long as true religion is absent, rather
disgraces than graces your empire, I tremble.  And you yourself who have
risen to be so high and great, now that vile and honour-hating demons
have brought you to this <span id="page_143">p. 143</span> <span
id="ix.xlii-Page_143"></span>pass, have begun not only to exalt yourself
above all human nature, but even to uplift yourself against God, and
insult His Church, mother and nurse of all, by sending to me, most
insignificant of men, orders to forward you a thousand pounds of gold. 
I am not so much astonished at the weight of the gold, although it is
very serious; but it has made me shed bitter tears over your so rapid
ruin.  I bethink me how you and I have learned together the lessons of
the best and holiest books.  Each of us went through the sacred and
God-inspired Scriptures.  Then nothing was hid from you.  Nowadays you
have become lost to proper feeling, beleaguered as you are with pride. 
Your serene Highness did not find out for the first time yesterday that
I do not live in the midst of superabundant wealth.  To-day you have
demanded a thousand pounds of gold of me.  I hope your serenity will
deign to spare me.  My property amounts to so much, that I really shall
not have enough to eat as much as I shall like to-day.  Under my roof
the art of cookery is dead.  My servants’ knife never touches blood. 
The most important viands, in which lies our abundance, are leaves of
herbs with very coarse bread and sour wine, so that our senses are not
dulled by gluttony, and do not indulge in excess.

<span id="ix.xlii-p5"></span>2.  Your excellent tribune Lausus, trusty
minister of your orders, has also reported to me that a certain woman
came as a suppliant to your serenity on the occasion of the death of her
son by poison; that it has been judged by you that poisoners are not
allowed to exist; <span id="fr_2057"></span>[2058](#fn_2057.md) if any
there be, that they are to be destroyed, or, only those are reserved,
who are to fight with beasts.  And, this rightly decided by you, seems
strange to me, for your efforts to cure the pain of great wounds by
petty remedies are to the last degree ridiculous.  After insulting God,
it is useless for you to give heed to widows and orphans.  The former is
mad and dangerous; the latter the part of a merciful and kindly man.  It
is a serious thing for a private individual like myself to speak to an
emperor; it will be more serious for you to speak to God.  No one will
appear to mediate between God and man.  What you read you did not
understand.  If you had understood, you would not have condemned. <span

reference to Apologies by the younger Apollinarius, bp. of the Syrian
Laodicea (afterwards the heresiarch) and others.  The reply is credited
to ‘the bishops,’ with the remark that some attribute it to Basil.
