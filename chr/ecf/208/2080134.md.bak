<span id="ix.lxii-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.lxii-p1.1"></span>Letter LXI. <span
id="fr_2221"></span>[2222](#fn_2221.md) </span>

<span id="ix.lxii-p3"></span>*To Athanasius, Bishop of
Alexandria*. <span id="fr_2222"></span>[2223](#fn_2222.md)

<span id="ix.lxii-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.lxii-p5.1"></span>I have</span> read the letter of your holiness,
in which you have expressed your distress at the unhappy governor of
Libya.  I am grieved that my own country should have given birth to and
nurtured such vices.  I am grieved too that Libya, a neighbouring
country, should suffer from our evils, and should have been delivered to
the inhumanity of a man whose life is marked at once by cruelty and
crime.  This however is only in accordance with the wisdom of the
Preacher, “Woe to thee O land when thy King is a child;” <span
id="fr_2223"></span>[2224](#fn_2223) (a still further touch of trouble.md)
and whose “Princes” do not “eat” after night but revel at mid-day,
raging after other men’s wives with less understanding than brute
beasts.  This man must surely look for the scourges of the righteous
Judge, repaid him in exact requital for those which he himself has
previously inflicted on the saints.  Notice has been given to my Church
in accordance with the letter of your reverence, and he shall be held by
all as abominable, cut off from fire, water and shelter, if indeed in
the case of men so possessed there is any use in general and unanimous
condemnation.  Notoriety is enough for him, and your own letter, which
has been read in all directions, for I shall not fail to show it to all
his friends and relatives.  Assuredly, even if retribution <span
id="page_162">p. 162</span> <span id="ix.lxii-Page_162"></span>does not
reach him at once, as it did Pharaoh, certainly it will bring on him
hereafter a heavy and hard requital.

<span id="ix.lxii-p4"></span> This, the first of Basil’s six extant
letters to Athanasius, is placed by the Ben. Ed. in 371.  It has no
certain indication of date.  Athanasius, in the few years of comparative
calm which preceded his death in May, 373, had excommunicated a vicious
governor in Libya, a native of Cappadocia, and announced his act to
Basil.  The intercourse opened by this official communication led to a
more important correspondence.
