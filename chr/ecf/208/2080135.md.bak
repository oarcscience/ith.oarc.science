id="ix.lxiii-p1.1"></span>Letter LXII. <span
id="fr_2224"></span>[2225](#fn_2224.md) </span>

<span id="ix.lxiii-p3"></span>*To the Church of Parnassus*. <span
id="fr_2225"></span>[2226](#fn_2225.md)

<span id="ix.lxiii-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.lxiii-p5.1"></span>Following</span> an ancient custom, which has
obtained for many years, and at the same time shewing you love in God,
which is the fruit of the Spirit, I now, my pious friends, address this
letter to you.  I feel with you at once in your grief at the event which
has befallen you, and in your anxiety at the matter which you have in
hand.  Concerning all these troubles I can only say, that an occasion is
given us to look to the injunctions of the Apostle, and not to sorrow
“even as others which have no hope.” <span
id="fr_2226"></span>[2227](#fn_2226.md)   I do not mean that we should be
insensible to the loss we have suffered, but that we should not succumb
to our sorrow, while we count the Pastor happy in his end.  He has died
in a ripe old age, and has found his rest in the great honour given him
by his Lord.

<span id="ix.lxiii-p7"></span>As to the future I have this
recommendation to give you.  You must now lay aside all mourning; you
must come to yourselves; you must rise to the necessary management of
the Church; to the end that the holy God may give heed to His own little
flock, and may grant you a shepherd in accordance with His own will, who
may wisely feed you.

right bank of the Halys, on or near a hill whence it was named, on the
road between Ancyra and Archelais.  The letter appears to Maran (*Vita
S. Bas*. xvi.) to have been written before the encouragement given to
the Arians by the visit of Valens in 372.  The result of Basil’s appeal
to the Parnassenes was the election of an orthodox bishop, expelled by
the Arians in 375, and named Hypsis or Hypsinus.  *cf. Letter*
ccxxxvii., where Ecdicius is said to have succeeded Hypsis; and
