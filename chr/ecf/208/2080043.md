<span id="vii.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vii.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIII.</span>

<span id="vii.xiv-p2"></span>Statement of the reason why in the writings
of Paul the angels are associated with the Father and the Son.

<span id="vii.xiv-p3"></span>29.  <span class="c14"><span
id="vii.xiv-p3.1"></span>It</span> is, however, objected that other
beings which are enumerated with the Father and the Son are certainly
not always glorified together with them.  The apostle, for instance, in
his charge to Timothy, associates the angels with them in the words, “I
charge thee before God and the Lord Jesus Christ and the elect
angels.” <span id="fr_959"></span>[960](#fn_959)   We are not for
alienating the angels from the rest of creation, and yet, it is argued,
we do not allow of their being reckoned with the Father and the Son.  To
this I reply, although the argument, so obviously absurd is it, does not
really deserve a reply, that possibly before a mild and gentle judge,
and especially before One who by His leniency to those arraigned before
Him demonstrates the unimpeachable equity of His decisions, one might be
willing to offer as witness even a fellow-slave; but for a slave to be
made free and called a son <span id="page_19">p. 19</span> <span
id="vii.xiv-Page_19"></span>of God and quickened from death can only be
brought about by Him who has acquired natural kinship with us, and has
been changed from the rank of a slave.  For how can we be made kin with
God by one who is an alien?  How can we be freed by one who is himself
under the yoke of slavery?  It follows that the mention of the Spirit
and that of angels are not made under like conditions.  The Spirit is
called on as Lord of life, and the angels as allies of their
fellow-slaves and faithful witnesses of the truth.  It is customary for
the saints to deliver the commandments of God in the presence of
witnesses, as also the apostle himself says to Timothy, “The things
which thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou
to faithful men;” <span id="fr_960"></span>[961](#fn_960) and now he
calls the angels to witness, for he knows that angels shall be present
with the Lord when He shall come in the glory of His Father to judge the
world in righteousness.  For He says, “Whoever shall confess me before
men, him shall the Son of Man also confess before the angels of God, but
he that denieth Me before men shall be denied before the angels of
God;” <span id="fr_961"></span>[962](#fn_961) and Paul in another place
says, “When the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his
angels.” <span id="fr_962"></span>[963](#fn_962)   Thus he already
testifies before the angels, preparing good proofs for himself at the
great tribunal.

<span id="vii.xiv-p8"></span>30.  And not only Paul, but generally all
those to whom is committed any ministry of the word, never cease from
testifying, but call heaven and earth to witness on the ground that now
every deed that is done is done within them, and that in the examination
of all the actions of life they will be present with the judged.  So it
is said, “He shall call to the heavens above and to earth, that he may
judge his people.” <span id="fr_963"></span>[964](#fn_963)   And so
Moses when about to deliver his oracles to the people says, “I call
heaven and earth to witness this day;” <span
id="fr_964"></span>[965](#fn_964) and again in his song he says, “Give
ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak, and hear, O earth, the words of my
mouth;” <span id="fr_965"></span>[966](#fn_965) and Isaiah, “Hear, O
heavens, and give ear, O earth;” <span id="fr_966"></span>[967](#fn_966)
and Jeremiah describes astonishment in heaven at the tidings of the
unholy deeds of the people:  “The heaven was astonished at this, and was
horribly afraid, because my people committed two evils.” <span
id="fr_967"></span>[968](#fn_967)   And so the apostle, knowing the
angels to be set over men as tutors and guardians, calls them to
witness.  Moreover, Joshua, the son of Nun, even set up a stone as
witness of his words (already a heap somewhere had been called a witness
by Jacob), <span id="fr_968"></span>[969](#fn_968) for he says, “Behold
this stone shall be a witness unto you this day to the end of days, when
ye lie to the Lord our God,” <span id="fr_969"></span>[970](#fn_969)
perhaps believing that by God’s power even the stones would speak to the
conviction of the transgressors; or, if not, that at least each man’s
conscience would be wounded by the force of the reminder.  In this
manner they who have been entrusted with the stewardship of souls
provide witnesses, whatever they may be, so as to produce them at some
future day.  But the Spirit is ranked together with God, not on account
of the emergency of the moment, but on account of the natural
fellowship; is not dragged in by us, but invited by the Lord.
