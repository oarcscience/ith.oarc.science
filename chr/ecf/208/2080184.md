id="ix.cxii-p1.1"></span>Letter CXI. <span
id="fr_2374"></span>[2375](#fn_2374.md) </span>

<span id="ix.cxii-p3"></span>* To Modestus, the prefect*.

<span id="ix.cxii-p4"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cxii-p4.1"></span>Under</span> any ordinary circumstances I
should have lacked courage to intrude upon your excellency, for I know
how to gauge my own importance and to recognise dignities.  But now that
I have seen a friend in a distressing position at having been summoned
before you, I have ventured to give him this letter.  I hope that by
using it, as a kind of propitiatory symbol, he may meet with merciful
consideration.  Truly, although I am of no account, moderation itself
may be able to conciliate the most merciful of prefects, and to win
pardon for me.  Thus if my friend has done no wrong, he may be saved by
the mere force of truth; if he has erred, he may be forgiven through my
entreaty.

<span id="ix.cxii-p5"></span>How we are situated here no one knows
better than yourself, for you discern the weak parts in each man and
rule all with your admirable forethought.
