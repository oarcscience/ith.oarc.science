<span id="ix.xliii-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.xliii-p1.1"></span>Letter XLII. <span
id="fr_2059"></span>[2060](#fn_2059.md) </span>

<span id="ix.xliii-p3"></span>*To Chilo, his disciple*.

<span id="ix.xliii-p4"></span>1.  <span class="c14"><span
id="ix.xliii-p4.1"></span>If</span>, my true brother, you gladly suffer
yourself to be advised by me as to what course of action you should
pursue, specially in the points in which you have referred to me for
advice, you will owe me your salvation.  Many men have had the courage
to enter upon the solitary life; but to live it out to the end is a task
which perhaps has been achieved by few.  The end is not necessarily
involved in the intention; yet in the end is the guerdon of the toil. 
No advantage, therefore, accrues to men who fail to press on to the end
of what they have in view and only adopt the solitary’s life in its
inception.  Nay, they make their profession ridiculous, and are charged
by outsiders with unmanliness and instability of purpose.  Of these,
moreover, the Lord says, who wishing to build a house “sitteth not down
first and counteth the cost whether he have sufficient to finish it?
lest haply after he hath laid the foundation and is not able to finish
it,” the passers-by “begin to mock him saying,” this man laid a
foundation “and was not able to finish.” <span
id="fr_2060"></span>[2061](#fn_2060.md)   Let the start, then, mean that
you heartily advance in virtue.  The right noble athlete Paul, wishing
us not to rest in easy security on so much of our life as may have been
lived well in the past, but, every day to attain further progress, says
“Forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those
things which are before, I press toward the mark for the prize of the
high calling.” <span id="fr_2061"></span>[2062](#fn_2061.md)   So truly
stands the whole of human life, not contented with what has gone before
and fed not so much on the past as on the future.  For how is a man the
better for having his belly filled yesterday, if his natural hunger
fails to find its proper satisfaction in food to-day?  In the same way
the soul gains nothing by yesterday’s virtue unless it be followed by
the right conduct of to-day.  For it is said “I shall judge thee as I
shall find thee.”

<span id="ix.xliii-p7"></span>2.  Vain then is the labour of the
righteous man, and free from blame is the way of the sinner, if a change
befall, and the former turn from the better to the worse, and the latter
from the worse to the better.  So we hear from Ezekiel teaching as it
were in <span id="page_144">p. 144</span> <span
id="ix.xliii-Page_144"></span>the name of the Lord, when he says, “if
the righteous turneth away and committeth iniquity, I will not remember
the righteousness which he committed before; in his sin he shall
die,” <span id="fr_2062"></span>[2063](#fn_2062.md) and so too about the
sinner; if he turn away from his wickedness, and do that which is right,
he shall live.  Where were all the labours of God’s servant Moses, when
the gainsaying of one moment shut him out from entering into the
promised land?  What became of the companionship of Gehazi with
Elissæus, when he brought leprosy on himself by his covetousness?  What
availed all Solomon’s vast wisdom, and his previous regard for God, when
afterwards from his mad love of women he fell into idolatry?  Not even
the blessed David was blameless, when his thoughts went astray and he
sinned against the wife of Uriah.  One example were surely enough for
keeping safe one who is living a godly life, the fall from the better to
the worse of Judas, who, after being so long Christ’s disciple, for a
mean gain sold his Master and got a halter for himself.  Learn then,
brother, that it is not he who begins well who is perfect.  It is he who
ends well who is approved in God’s sight.  Give then no sleep to your
eyes or slumber to your eyelids <span
id="fr_2063"></span>[2064](#fn_2063.md) that you may be delivered “as a roe
from the net and a bird from the snare.” <span
id="fr_2064"></span>[2065](#fn_2064.md)   For, behold, you are passing
through the midst of snares; you are treading on the top of a high wall
whence a fall is perilous to the faller; wherefore do not straightway
attempt extreme discipline; above all things beware of confidence in
yourself, lest you fall from a height of discipline through want of
training.  It is better to advance a little at a time.  Withdraw then by
degrees from the pleasures of life, gradually destroying all your wonted
habits, lest you bring on yourself a crowd of temptations by irritating
all your passions at once.  When you have mastered one passion, then
begin to wage war against another, and in this manner you will in good
time get the better of all.  Indulgence, so far as the name goes, is
one, but its practical workings are diverse.  First then, brother, meet
every temptation with patient endurance.  And by what various
temptations the faithful man is proved; by worldly loss, by accusations,
by lies, by opposition, by calumny, by persecution!  These and the like
are the tests of the faithful.  Further, be quiet, not rash in speech,
not quarrelsome, not disputatious, not covetous of vain glory, not more
anxious to get than to give knowledge, <span
id="fr_2065"></span>[2066](#fn_2065.md) not a man of many words, but always
more ready to learn than to teach.  Do not trouble yourself about
worldly life; from it no good can come to you.  It is said, “That my
mouth speak not the works of men.” <span
id="fr_2066"></span>[2067](#fn_2066.md)   The man who is fond of talking
about sinners’ doings, soon rouses the desire for self indulgence; much
better busy yourself about the lives of good men for so you will get
some profit for yourself.  Do not be anxious to go travelling
about <span id="fr_2067"></span>[2068](#fn_2067.md) from village to village
and house to house; rather avoid them as traps for souls.  If any one,
for true pity’s sake, invite you with many pleas to enter his house, let
him be told to follow the faith of the centurion, who, when Jesus was
hastening to him to perform an act of healing, besought him not to do so
in the words, “Lord I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my
roof, but speak the word only and my servant shall be healed,” <span
id="fr_2068"></span>[2069](#fn_2068.md) and when Jesus had said to him “Go
thy way; as thou hast believed, so be it done unto thee,” <span
id="fr_2069"></span>[2070](#fn_2069.md) his servant was healed from that
hour.  Learn then, brother, that it was the faith of the suppliant, not
the presence of Christ, which delivered the sick man.  So too now, if
you pray, in whatever place you be, and the sick man believes that he
will be aided by your prayers, all will fall out as he desires.

<span id="ix.xliii-p16"></span>3.  You will not love your kinsfolk more
than the Lord.  “He that loveth,” He says, “father, or mother, or
brother, more than me, is not worthy of me.” <span
id="fr_2070"></span>[2071](#fn_2070.md)   What is the meaning of the Lord’s
commandment?  “He that taketh not up his cross and followeth after me,
cannot be my disciple?” <span id="fr_2071"></span>[2072](#fn_2071.md)   If,
together with Christ, you died to your kinsfolk according to the flesh,
why do you wish to live with them again?  If for your kinsfolk’s sake
you are building up again what you destroyed for Christ’s sake, you make
yourself a transgressor.  Do not then for your kinsfolk’s sake abandon
your place:  if you abandon your place, perhaps you will abandon your
mode of life.  Love not the crowd, nor the country, nor the town; love
the desert, ever abiding by yourself with no wandering mind, <span
id="fr_2072"></span>[2073](#fn_2072.md) regarding prayer and praise as your
life’s work.  Never neglect reading, especially of the New Testament,
because very frequently mischief comes of <span id="page_145">p.
145</span> <span id="ix.xliii-Page_145"></span>reading the Old; not
because what is written is harmful, but because the minds of the injured
are weak.  All bread is nutritious, but it may be injurious to the
sick.  Just so all Scripture is God inspired and profitable, <span
id="fr_2073"></span>[2074](#fn_2073.md) and there is nothing in it
unclean:  only to him who thinks it is unclean, to him it is unclean. 
“Prove all things; hold fast that which is good; abstain from every form
of evil.” <span id="fr_2074"></span>[2075](#fn_2074.md)   “All things are
lawful but all things are not expedient.” <span
id="fr_2075"></span>[2076](#fn_2075.md)   Among all, with whom you come in
contact, be in all things a giver of no offence, <span
id="fr_2076"></span>[2077](#fn_2076.md) cheerful, “loving as a
brother,” <span id="fr_2077"></span>[2078](#fn_2077.md) pleasant,
humble-minded, never missing the mark of hospitality through
extravagance of meats, but always content with what is at hand.  Take no
more from any one than the daily necessaries of the solitary life. 
Above all things shun gold as the soul’s foe, the father of sin and the
agent of the devil.  Do not expose yourself to the charge of
covetousness on the pretence of ministering to the poor; but, if any one
brings you money for the poor and you know of any who are in need,
advise the owner himself to convey it to his needy brothers, lest haply
your conscience may be defiled by the acceptance of money.

<span id="ix.xliii-p25"></span>4.  Shun pleasures; seek after
continence; train your body to hard work; accustom your soul to trials. 
Regarding the dissolution of soul and body as release from every evil,
await that enjoyment of everlasting good things in which all the saints
have part.  Ever, as it were, holding the balance against every
suggestion of the devil throw in a holy thought, and, as the scale
inclines do thou go with it.  Above all when the evil thought starts up
and says, “What is the good of your passing your life in this place? 
What do you gain by withdrawing yourself from the society of men?  Do
you not know that those, who are ordained by God to be bishops of God’s
churches, constantly associate with their fellows, and indefatigably
attend spiritual gatherings at which those who are present derive very
great advantage?  There are to be enjoyed explanations of hard sayings,
expositions of the teachings of the apostles, interpretations of the
thoughts of the gospels, lessons in theology and the intercourse of
spiritual brethren, who do great good to all they meet if only by the
sight of their faces.  You, however, who have decided to be a stranger
to all these good things, are sitting here in a wild state like the
beasts.  You see round you a wide desert with scarcely a fellow creature
in it, lack of all instruction, estrangement from your brothers, and
your spirit inactive in carrying out the commandments of God.”  Now,
when the evil thought rises against you, with all these ingenious
pretexts and wishes to destroy you, oppose to it in pious reflection
your own practical experience, and say, You tell me that the things in
the world are good; the reason why I came here is because I judged
myself unfit for the good things of the world.  With the world’s good
things are mingled evil things, and the evil things distinctly have the
upper hand.  Once when I attended the spiritual assemblies I did with
difficulty find one brother, who, so far as I could see, feared God, but
he was a victim of the devil, and I heard from him amusing stories and
tales made up to deceive those whom he met.  After him I fell in with
many thieves, plunderers, tyrants.  I saw disgraceful drunkards; I saw
the blood of the oppressed; I saw women’s beauty, which tortured my
chastity.  From actual fornication I fled, but I defiled my virginity by
the thoughts of my heart.  I heard many discourses which were good for
the soul, but I could not discover in the case of any one of the
teachers that his life was worthy of his words.  After this, again, I
heard a great number of plays, which were made attractive by wanton
songs.  Then I heard a lyre sweetly played, the applause of tumblers,
the talk of clowns, all kinds of jests and follies and all the noises of
a crowd.  I saw the tears of the robbed, the agony of the victims of
tyranny, the shrieks of the tortured.  I looked and lo, there was no
spiritual assembly, but only a sea, wind-tossed and agitated, and trying
to drown every one at once under its waves. <span
id="fr_2078"></span>[2079](#fn_2078.md)   Tell me, O evil thought, tell me,
dæmon of short lived pleasure and vain glory, what is the good of my
seeing and hearing all these things, when I am powerless to succour any
of those who are thus wronged; when I am allowed neither to defend the
helpless nor correct the fallen; when I am perhaps doomed to destroy
myself too.  For just as a very little fresh water is blown away by a
storm of wind and dust, in like manner the good deeds, that we think we
do in this life, are overwhelmed by the multitude of evils.  Pieces
acted for men in this life are driven through joy and merriment, like
stakes into their hearts, so that the brightness of their worship is
be-dimmed.  But the wails and lamentations of <span id="page_146">p.
146</span> <span id="ix.xliii-Page_146"></span>men wronged by their
fellows are introduced to make a show of the patience of the poor.

<span id="ix.xliii-p27"></span>5.  What good then do I get except the
loss of my soul?  For this reason I migrate to the hills like a bird. 
“I am escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers.” <span
id="fr_2079"></span>[2080](#fn_2079.md)   I am living, O evil thought, in
the desert in which the Lord lived.  Here is the oak of Mamre; here is
the ladder going up to heaven, and the stronghold of the angels which
Jacob saw; here is the wilderness in which the people purified received
the law, and so came into the land of promise and saw God.  Here is
Mount Carmel where Elias sojourned and pleased God.  Here is the plain
whither Esdras withdrew, and at God’s bidding uttered all the God
inspired books. <span id="fr_2080"></span>[2081](#fn_2080.md)   Here is the
wilderness in which the blessed John ate locusts and preached repentance
to men.  Here is the Mount of Olives, whither Christ came and prayed,
and taught us to pray.  Here is Christ the lover of the wilderness, for
He says “Where two or three are gathered together in my name there am I
in the midst of them.” <span id="fr_2081"></span>[2082](#fn_2081.md)  
“Here is the strait and narrow way which leadeth unto life.” <span
id="fr_2082"></span>[2083](#fn_2082.md)   Here are the teachers and
prophets “wandering in deserts and in mountains and in dens and caves of
the earth.” <span id="fr_2083"></span>[2084](#fn_2083.md)   Here are
apostles and evangelists and solitaries’ life remote from cities.  This
I have embraced with all my heart, that I may win what has been promised
to Christ’s martyrs and all His other saints, and so I may truly say,
“Because of the words of thy lips I have kept hard ways.” <span
id="fr_2084"></span>[2085](#fn_2084.md)   I have heard of Abraham, God’s
friend, who obeyed the divine voice and went into the wilderness; of
Isaac who submitted to authority; of Jacob, the patriarch, who left his
home; of Joseph, the chaste, who was sold; of the three children, who
learnt how to fast, and fought with the fire; of Daniel thrown twice
into the lion’s den; <span id="fr_2085"></span>[2086](#fn_2085.md) of
Jeremiah speaking boldly, and thrown into a pit of mud; of Isaiah, who
saw unspeakable things, cut asunder with a saw; of Israel led away
captive; of John the rebuker of adultery, beheaded; of Christ’s martyrs
slain.  But why say more?  Here our Saviour Himself was crucified for
our sakes that by His death He might give us life, and train and attract
us all to endurance.  To Him I press on, and to the Father and to the
Holy Ghost.  I strive to be found true, judging myself unworthy of this
world’s goods.  And yet not I because of the world, but the world
because of me.  Think of all these things in your heart; follow them
with zeal; fight, as you have been commanded, for the truth to the
death.  For Christ was made “obedient” even “unto death.” <span
id="fr_2086"></span>[2087](#fn_2086.md)   The Apostle says, “Take heed lest
there be in any of you an evil heart…in departing from the living God. 
But exhort one another…(and edify one another <span
id="fr_2087"></span>[2088](#fn_2087) .md) while it is called to-day.” <span
id="fr_2088"></span>[2089](#fn_2088.md)   To-day means the whole time of
our life.  Thus living, brother, you will save yourself, you will make
me glad, and you will glorify God from everlasting to everlasting. 
Amen.

<span id="ix.xliii-p2"></span> This and the four succeeding letters must
be placed before the episcopate.  Their genuineness has been contested,
but apparently without much reason.  In one of the Parisian Codices the
title of xlii. is given with the note:  “Some attribute this work to the
holy Nilus.” Ceillier (iv. 435–437) is of opinion that, so far as style
goes, they must stand or fall together, and points out that xlvii. is
cited entire as Basil’s by Metaphrastes.
