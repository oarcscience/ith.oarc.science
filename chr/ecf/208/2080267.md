id="fr_2680"></span>[2681](#fn_2680.md) </span>

<span id="ix.cxcv-p3"></span>*To Zoilus*.

<span id="ix.cxcv-p4"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cxcv-p4.1"></span>What</span> are you about, most excellent sir,
in anticipating me in humility?  Educated as you are, and able to write
such a letter as you have sent, you nevertheless ask for forgiveness at
my hands, as though you were engaged in some undertaking rash and beyond
your position.  But a truce to mockery.  Continue to write to me on
every occasion.  Am I not wholly illiterate?  It is delightful to read
the letters of an eloquent writer.  Have I learned from Scripture how
good a thing is love?  I count intercourse with a loving friend
invaluable.  And I do hope that you may tell me of all the good gifts
which I pray for you; the best of health, and the prosperity of all your
house.  Now as to my own affairs, my condition is not more endurable
than usual.  It is enough to tell you this and you will understand the
bad state of my health.  It has indeed reached such extreme suffering as
to be as difficult to describe as to experience, if indeed your own
experience has fallen short of mine.  But it is the work of the good God
to give me power to bear in patience whatever trials are inflicted on me
for my own good at the hands of our merciful Lord.
