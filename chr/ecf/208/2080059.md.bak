<span id="vii.xxx-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vii.xxx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIX.</span>

<span id="vii.xxx-p2"></span>Enumeration of the illustrious men in the
Church who in their writings have used the word “with.”

<span id="vii.xxx-p3"></span>71.  <span class="c14"><span
id="vii.xxx-p3.1"></span>In</span> answer to the objection that the
doxology in the form “with the Spirit” has no written authority, we
maintain that if there is <span id="page_45">p. 45</span> <span
id="vii.xxx-Page_45"></span>no other instance of that which is
unwritten, then this must not be received.  But if the greater number of
our mysteries are admitted into our constitution without written
authority, then, in company with the many others, let us receive this
one.  For I hold it apostolic to abide also by the unwritten
traditions.  “I praise you,” it is said, “that ye remember me in all
things, and keep the ordinances as I delivered them to you;” <span
id="fr_1307"></span>[1308](#fn_1307.md) and “Hold fast the traditions which
ye have been taught whether by word, or our Epistle.” <span
id="fr_1308"></span>[1309](#fn_1308.md)   One of these traditions is the
practice which is now before us, which they who ordained from the
beginning, rooted firmly in the churches, delivering it to their
successors, and its use through long custom advances pace by pace with
time.  If, as in a Court of Law, we were at a loss for documentary
evidence, but were able to bring before you a large number of witnesses,
would you not give your vote for our acquittal?  I think so; for “at the
mouth of two or three witnesses shall the matter be established.” <span
id="fr_1309"></span>[1310](#fn_1309.md)   And if we could prove clearly to
you that a long period of time was in our favour, should we not have
seemed to you to urge with reason that this suit ought not to be brought
into court against us?  For ancient dogmas inspire a certain sense of
awe, venerable as they are with a hoary antiquity.  I will therefore
give you a list of the supporters of the word (and the time too must be
taken into account in relation to what passes unquestioned).  For it did
not originate with us.  How could it?  We, in comparison with the time
during which this word has been in vogue, are, to use the words of Job,
“but of yesterday.” <span id="fr_1310"></span>[1311](#fn_1310.md)   I
myself, if I must speak of what concerns me individually, cherish this
phrase as a legacy left me by my fathers.  It was delivered to me by
one <span id="fr_1311"></span>[1312](#fn_1311.md) who spent a long life in
the service of God, and by him I was both baptized, and admitted to the
ministry of the church.  While examining, so far as I could, if any of
the blessed men of old used the words to which objection is now made, I
found many worthy of credit both on account of their early date, and
also a characteristic in which they are unlike the men of to-day—because
of the exactness of their knowledge.  Of these some coupled the word in
the doxology by the preposition, others by the conjunction, but were in
no case supposed to be acting divergently,—at least so far as the right
sense of true religion is concerned.

<span id="vii.xxx-p9"></span>72.  There is the famous Irenæus, <span
id="fr_1312"></span>[1313](#fn_1312.md) and Clement of Rome; <span
id="fr_1313"></span>[1314](#fn_1313.md) Dionysius of Rome, <span
id="fr_1314"></span>[1315](#fn_1314.md) and, strange to say, Dionysius of
Alexandria, in his second Letter to his namesake, on “Conviction and
Defence,” so concludes.  I will give you his very words.  “Following all
these, we, too, since we have received from the presbyters who were
before us a form and rule, offering thanksgiving in the same terms with
them, thus conclude our Letter to you.  To God the Father and the Son
our Lord Jesus Christ, with the Holy Ghost, glory and might for ever and
ever; amen.”  And no one can say that this passage has been altered.  He
would not have so persistently stated that he had received a form and
rule if he had said “*in* the Spirit.”  For of this phrase the use is
abundant:  it was the use of “*with*” which required defence.  Dionysius
moreover in the middle of his treatise thus writes in opposition to the
Sabellians, “If by the hypostases being three they say that they are
divided, there are three, though they like it not.  Else let them
destroy the divine Trinity altogether.”  And again:  “most divine on
this account after the Unity is the Trinity.” <span
id="fr_1315"></span>[1316](#fn_1315.md)   Clement, in more primitive
fashion, writes, “God lives, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the Holy
Ghost.” <span id="fr_1316"></span>[1317](#fn_1316.md)   And now let us hear
how Irenæus, who lived near the times of the Apostles, mentions the
Spirit in his work “Against the Heresies.” <span
id="fr_1317"></span>[1318](#fn_1317.md)   “The Apostle rightly calls
*carnal* them that are unbridled and carried away to their own desires,
having no desire for the Holy Spirit,” <span
id="fr_1318"></span>[1319](#fn_1318.md) and in another passage Irenæus
says, “The Apostle exclaimed that flesh and blood cannot inherit the
kingdom of the heavens lest we, being without share in the divine
Spirit, fall short of the kingdom of the heavens.”  If any one thinks
Eusebius of Palestine <span id="fr_1319"></span>[1320](#fn_1319.md) worthy
of credit on <span id="page_46">p. 46</span> <span
id="vii.xxx-Page_46"></span>account of his wide experience, I point
further to the very words he uses in discussing questions concerning the
polygamy of the ancients.  Stirring up himself to his work, he writes
“invoking the holy God of the Prophets, the Author of light, through our
Saviour Jesus Christ, with the Holy Spirit.”

<span id="vii.xxx-p18"></span>73.  Origen, too, in many of his
expositions of the Psalms, we find using the form of doxology “*with*
the Holy Ghost.”  The opinions which he held concerning the Spirit were
not always and everywhere sound; nevertheless in many passages even he
himself reverently recognises the force of established usage, and
expresses himself concerning the Spirit in terms consistent with true
religion.  It is, if I am not mistaken, in the Sixth <span
id="fr_1320"></span>[1321](#fn_1320.md) Book of his *Commentary on the
Gospel of St. John* that he distinctly makes the Spirit an object of
worship.  His words are:—“The washing or water is a symbol of the
cleaning of the soul which is washed clean of all filth that comes of
wickedness; <span id="fr_1321"></span>[1322](#fn_1321.md) but none the less
is it also by itself, to him who yields himself to the God-head of the
adorable Trinity, through the power of the invocations, the origin and
source of blessings.”  And again, in his *Exposition of the Epistle to
the Romans* “the holy powers,” he says “are able to receive the
Only-begotten, and the Godhead of the Holy Spirit.”  Thus I apprehend,
the powerful influence of tradition frequently impels men to express
themselves in terms contradictory to their own opinions. <span
id="fr_1322"></span>[1323](#fn_1322.md)   Moreover this form of the
doxology was not unknown even to Africanus the historian.  In the Fifth
Book of his *Epitome of the Times* he says “we who know the weight of
those terms, and are not ignorant of the grace of faith, render thanks
to the Father, who bestowed on us His own creatures, Jesus Christ, the
Saviour of the world and our Lord, to whom be glory and majesty with the
Holy Ghost, for ever.” <span id="fr_1323"></span>[1324](#fn_1323.md)   The
rest of the passages may peradventure be viewed with suspicion; or may
really have been altered, and the fact of their having been tampered
with will be difficult to detect because the difference consists in a
single syllable.  Those however which I have quoted at length are out of
the reach of any dishonest manipulation, and can easily be verified from
the actual works.

<span id="vii.xxx-p24"></span>I will now adduce another piece of
evidence which might perhaps seem insignificant, but because of its
antiquity must in nowise be omitted by a defendant who is indicted on a
charge of innovation.  It seemed fitting to our fathers not to receive
the gift of the light at eventide in silence, but, on its appearing,
immediately to give thanks.  Who was the author of these words of
thanksgiving at the lighting of the lamps, we are not able to say.  The
people, however, utter the ancient form, and no one has ever reckoned
guilty of impiety those who say “We praise Father, Son, and God’s Holy
Spirit.” <span id="fr_1324"></span>[1325](#fn_1324.md)   And if any one
knows the Hymn of Athenogenes, <span
id="fr_1325"></span>[1326](#fn_1325.md) which, as he was hurrying on to his
perfecting by fire, he left as a kind of farewell gift <span
id="fr_1326"></span>[1327](#fn_1326.md) to his friends, he knows the mind
of the martyrs as to the Spirit.  On this head I shall say no more.

<span id="vii.xxx-p28"></span>74.  But where shall I rank the great
Gregory, <span id="fr_1327"></span>[1328](#fn_1327.md) and the words
uttered by him?  Shall we not place among Apostles and <span
id="page_47">p. 47</span> <span id="vii.xxx-Page_47"></span>Prophets a
man who walked by the same Spirit as they; <span
id="fr_1328"></span>[1329](#fn_1328.md) who never through all his days
diverged from the footprints of the saints; who maintained, as long as
he lived, the exact principles of evangelical citizenship?  I am sure
that we shall do the truth a wrong if we refuse to number that soul with
the people of God, shining as it did like a beacon in the Church of God;
for by the fellow-working of the Spirit the power which he had over
demons was tremendous, and so gifted was he with the grace of the word
“for obedience to the faith among…the nations,” <span
id="fr_1329"></span>[1330](#fn_1329.md) that, although only seventeen
Christians were handed over to him, he brought the whole people alike in
town and country through knowledge to God.  He too by Christ’s mighty
name commanded even rivers to change their course, <span
id="fr_1330"></span>[1331](#fn_1330.md) and caused a lake, which afforded a
ground of quarrel to some covetous brethren, to dry up. <span
id="fr_1331"></span>[1332](#fn_1331.md)   Moreover his predictions of
things to come were such as in no wise to fall short of those of the
great prophets.  To recount all his wonderful works in detail would be
too long a task.  By the superabundance of gifts, wrought in him by the
Spirit in all power and in signs and in marvels, he was styled a second
Moses by the very enemies of the Church.  Thus in all that he through
grace accomplished, alike by word and deed, a light seemed ever to be
shining, token of the heavenly power from the unseen which followed
him.  To this day he is a great object of admiration to the people of
his own neighbourhood, and his memory, established in the churches ever
fresh and green, is not dulled by length of time.  Thus not a practice,
not a word, not a mystic rite has been added to the Church besides what
he bequeathed to it.  Hence truly on account of the antiquity of their
institution many of their ceremonies appear to be defective. <span
id="fr_1332"></span>[1333](#fn_1332.md)   For his successors in the
administration of the Churches could not endure to accept any subsequent
discovery in addition to what had had his sanction.  Now one of the
institutions of Gregory is the very form of the doxology to which
objection is now made, preserved by the Church on the authority of his
tradition; a statement which may be verified without much trouble by any
one who likes to make a short journey.  That our Firmilian held this
belief is testified by the writings which he has left. <span
id="fr_1333"></span>[1334](#fn_1333.md)   The contemporaries also of the
illustrious Meletius say that he was of this opinion.  But why quote
ancient authorities?  Now in the East are not the maintainers of true
religion known chiefly by this one term, and separated from their
adversaries as by a watchword?  I have heard from a certain
Mesopotamian, a man at once well skilled in the language and of
unperverted opinions, that by the usage of his country it is impossible
for any one, even though he may wish to do so, to express himself in any
other way, and that they are compelled by the idiom of their mother
tongue to offer the doxology by the syllable “and,” or, I should more
accurately say, by their equivalent expressions.  We Cappadocians, too,
so speak in the dialect of our country, the Spirit having so early as
the division of tongues foreseen the utility of the phrase.  And what of
the whole West, almost from Illyricum to the boundaries of our world? 
Does it not support this word?

<span id="vii.xxx-p36"></span>75.  How then can I be an innovator and
creator of new terms, when I adduce as originators and champions of the
word whole nations, cities, custom going back beyond the memory of man,
men who were pillars of the church and conspicuous for all knowledge and
spiritual power?  For this cause this banded array of foes is set in
motion against me, and town and village and remotest regions are full of
my calumniators.  Sad and painful are these things to them that seek for
peace, but great is the reward of patience for sufferings endured for
the Faith’s sake.  So besides these let sword flash, let axe be whetted,
let fire burn fiercer than that of Babylon, let every instrument of
torture be set in motion against me.  To me nothing is more fearful than
failure to fear the threats which the Lord has directed against them
that blaspheme the Spirit. <span id="fr_1334"></span>[1335](#fn_1334.md)
 Kindly readers will find a satisfactory defence in what I have said,
that I accept a phrase so dear and so familiar to the saints, and
confirmed by usage so long, inasmuch as, from the day when the Gospel
was first preached up to our own time, it is shewn to have been admitted
to all full rights within the churches, and, what is of greatest moment,
to have been accepted as bearing a sense in accordance with holiness and
true religion.  But before the great tribunal what have I prepared to
say in my defence?  This; that I was in the first place led to the glory
of the Spirit by the honour conferred by the Lord <span id="page_48">p.
48</span> <span id="vii.xxx-Page_48"></span>in associating Him with
Himself and with His Father at baptism; <span
id="fr_1335"></span>[1336](#fn_1335.md) and secondly by the introduction of
each of us to the knowledge of God by such an initiation; and above all
by the fear of the threatened punishment shutting out the thought of all
indignity and unworthy conception.  But our opponents, what will they
say?  After shewing neither reverence for the Lord’s honour <span
id="fr_1336"></span>[1337](#fn_1336.md) nor fear of His threats, what kind
of defence will they have for their blasphemy?  It is for them to make
up their mind about their own action or even now to change it.  For my
own part I would pray most earnestly that the good God will make His
peace rule in the hearts of all, <span
id="fr_1337"></span>[1338](#fn_1337.md) so that these men who are swollen
with pride and set in battle array against us may be calmed by the
Spirit of meekness and of love; and that if they have become utterly
savage, and are in an untamable state, He will grant to us at least to
bear with long suffering all that we have to bear at their hands.  In
short “to them that have in themselves the sentence of death,” <span
id="fr_1338"></span>[1339](#fn_1338.md) it is not suffering for the sake of
the Faith which is painful; what is hard to bear is to fail to fight its
battle.  The athlete does not so much complain of being wounded in the
struggle as of not being able even to secure admission into the
stadium.  Or perhaps this was the time for silence spoken of by Solomon
the wise. <span id="fr_1339"></span>[1340](#fn_1339.md)   For, when life is
buffeted by so fierce a storm that all the intelligence of those who are
instructed in the word is filled with the deceit of false reasoning and
confounded, like an eye filled with dust, when men are stunned by
strange and awful noises, when all the world is shaken and everything
tottering to its fall, what profits it to cry, as I am really crying, to
the wind?

<span class="c14"><span id="vii.xxx-p13.1"></span>a.d.</span> 247–265. 
Basil’s “strange to say” is of a piece with the view of Dionysius’
heretical tendencies expressed in Letter ix. *q.v.*  Athanasius,
however, (*De Sent. Dionysii*) was satisfied as to the orthodoxy of his
predecessor.  Bp. Westcott (*Dict. C. Biog*. i. 851) quotes Lumper
(*Hist. Pat*. xii. 86) as supposing that Basil’s charge against
Dionysius of sowing the seeds of the Anomœan heresy was due to imperfect
acquaintance with his writings.  In Letter clxxxviii. Basil calls him
“the Great,” which implies general approval.

connexion, as well as in time, through his personal knowledge of
Polycarp.  *Vide*his *Ep. to Florinus* quoted in Euseb., *Ecc. Hist*. v.
20.  In his work *On the Ogdoad*, quoted in the same chapter, Irenæus
says of himself that he <span class="Greek"><span

<span id="vii.xxx-p21"></span> As to Origen’s unorthodoxy concerning the
Holy Spirit St. Basil may have had in his mind such a passage as the
following from the First Book of the *De Principiis*, extant in the
original in Justinian, *Ep. ad Mennam*.  Migne, Pat. Gr. xi. p. 150. 
<span class="Greek"><span id="vii.xxx-p21.1"></span>ὅ</span><span

even exist as a whole in the translation of Rufinus, who omitted
portions, and St. Jerome thought that Rufinus had misrepresented it. 
Photius (*Biblioth. cod*. viii.) says that Origen, in asserting in this
work that the Son was made by the Father and the Spirit by the Son, is
most blasphemous.  Bp. Harold Browne, however (*Exposition of the xxxix.
Art.* p. 113, n. 1), is of opinion that if Rufinus fairly translated the
following passage, Origen cannot have been fairly charged with heresy
concerning the Holy Ghost:  “*Ne quis sane existimet nos ex eo quod
diximus Spiritum sanctum solis sanctis præstari.  Patris vero et Filii
beneficia vel inoperationes pervenire ad bonos et malos, justos et
injustos, prœtulisse per hoc Patri et Filio Spiritum Sanctum, vel
majorem ejus per hoc asserere dignitatem; quod utique valde inconsequens
est.  Proprietatem namque gratiæ ejus operisque descripsimus. * Porro
autem nihil in Trinitate majus minusve dicendum est, quum unius
Divinitatis Fons verbo ac ratione sua teneat universa, spiritu vero oris
sui quæ digna sunt, sanctificatione sanctificet, sicut in Psalmo
scriptum est verbo domini cœli firmati sunt et spiritu oris ejus omnis
virtus eorum.”  *De Princ.* I. iii. 7.

<span id="vii.xxx-p23"></span> Of the chief writings of Julius Africanus
(called Sextus Africanus by Suidas), who wrote at Emmaus and Alexandria
c. 220, only fragments remain.  A *Letter to Origen* is complete.  His
principal work was a *Chronicon* from the Creation to <span
class="c14"><span id="vii.xxx-p23.1"></span>a.d.</span> 221, in Five
Books.  Of this Dr. Salmon (*D.C.B.* i. 56) thinks the doxology quoted
by Basil was the conclusion.

<span class="Greek"><span id="vii.xxx-p25.3"></span>ἐπιλύχνιος
ψαλμός</span> (*Ap. Const*. viii. 35).  In the Vespers of the Eastern
Church an evening hymn is sung, translated in *D.C.A.* i. 634, “Joyful
Light of the holy glory of the immortal Father, the heavenly, the holy,
the blessed Jesus Christ, we having come to the setting of the sun and
beholding the evening light, praise God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. 
It is meet at all times that thou shouldest be hymned with auspicious
voices, Son of God, Giver of Life:  wherefore the world glorifieth
thee.”

<span id="vii.xxx-p26"></span> Identified by some with two early hymns,
<span class="Greek"><span id="vii.xxx-p26.1"></span>Δόξα ἐν
ὑψίστοις</span>, and <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xxx-p26.2"></span>φῶς ἱλαρόν</span>.

farewell gift and amulet or charm.  In *Ep*. cciii. 299 Basil says that
our Lord gave His disciples peace as an <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xxx-p27.6"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xxx-p27.7"></span>ξιτήριον δῶρον</span>, using the word, but in
conjunction with <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xxx-p27.8"></span>δῶρον</span>.  Greg. Naz., *Orat*. xiv. 223
speaks of our Lord leaving peace “<span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xxx-p27.9"></span>ὥ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xxx-p27.10"></span>σπερ ἄλλο τι ἐξιτήριον</span>.”

<span id="vii.xxx-p29"></span> *i.e*. Gregory, bishop of Neocæsarea,
known as Gregorius Thaumaturgus, or Gregory the Wonder-worker.  To the
modern reader “Gregory the Great” more naturally suggests Gregory of
Nazianzus, but this he hardly was to his friend and contemporary, though
the title had accrued to him by the time of the accepted Ephesine
Council in 431 (*vide* Labbe, vol. iv. p. 1192) Gregory the
Wonder-worker, † c. 270.
