<span id="ix.ccxxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.ccxxiv-p1.1"></span>Letter CCXXIII. <span
id="fr_2875"></span>[2876](#fn_2875.md) </span>

<span id="ix.ccxxiv-p3"></span>*Against Eustathius of Sebasteia*. <span
id="fr_2876"></span>[2877](#fn_2876.md)

<span id="ix.ccxxiv-p5"></span>1.  <span class="c14"><span
id="ix.ccxxiv-p5.1"></span>There</span> is a time to keep silence and a
time to speak, <span id="fr_2877"></span>[2878](#fn_2877.md) is the saying
of the Preacher.  Time enough has been given to silence, and now the
time has come to open my mouth for the publication of the truth
concerning matters that are, up to now, unknown.  The illustrious Job
bore his calamities for a long time in silence, and ever showed his
courage by holding out under the most intolerable sufferings, but when
he had struggled long enough in silence, and had persisted in covering
his anguish in the bottom of his heart, at last he opened his mouth and
uttered his well-known words. <span id="fr_2878"></span>[2879](#fn_2878.md)
  In my own case this is now the third year of my silence, and my boast
has become like that of the Psalmist, “I was as a man that heareth not
and in whose mouth are no reproofs.” <span
id="fr_2879"></span>[2880](#fn_2879.md)   Thus I shut up in the bottom of
my heart the pangs which I suffered on account of the calumnies directed
against me, for calumny humbles a man, and calumny makes a poor man
giddy. <span id="fr_2880"></span>[2881](#fn_2880.md)   If, therefore, the
mischief of calumny is so great as to cast down even the perfect man
from his height, for this is what Scripture indicates by the word man,
and by the poor man is meant he who lacks the great doctrines, as is the
view also of the prophet when he says, “These are poor, therefore they
shall not hear;…I will get me unto the great men,” <span
id="fr_2881"></span>[2882](#fn_2881.md) he means by poor those who are
lacking in understanding; and here, too, he plainly means those who are
not yet furnished in the inner man, and have not even come to the full
measure of their age; it is these who are said by the proverb to be made
giddy and tossed about.  Nevertheless I thought that I ought to bear my
troubles in silence, waiting for some indication to come out of them.  I
did not even think that what was said against me proceeded from ill
will; I thought it was the result of ignorance of the truth.  But now I
see that hostility increases with time, and that my slanderers are not
sorry for what they said at the beginning, and do not take any trouble
to make amends for the past, but go on and on and rally themselves
together to attain their original object.  This was to make my life
miserable and to devise means for sullying my reputation among the
brethren.  I, therefore, no longer see safety in silence.  I have
bethought me of the words of Isaiah:  “I have long time holden my peace,
shall I always be still and refrain myself?  I have been patient like a
travailing woman.” <span id="fr_2882"></span>[2883](#fn_2882.md)   God
grant that I may both receive the reward of silence, and gain some
strength to confute my opponents, and that <span id="page_263">p.
263</span> <span id="ix.ccxxiv-Page_263"></span>thus, by confuting them,
I may dry up the bitter torrent of falsehood that has gushed out against
me.  So might I say, “My soul has passed over the torrent;” <span
id="fr_2883"></span>[2884](#fn_2883.md) and, “If it had not been the Lord
who was on our side when men rose up against us,…then they had swallowed
us up quick, the water had drowned us.” <span
id="fr_2884"></span>[2885](#fn_2884.md)

<span id="ix.ccxxiv-p14"></span>2.  Much time had I spent in vanity, and
had wasted nearly all my youth in the vain labour which I underwent in
acquiring the wisdom made foolish by God.  Then once upon a time, like a
man roused from deep sleep, I turned my eyes to the marvellous light of
the truth of the Gospel, and I perceived the uselessness of “the wisdom
of the princes of this world, that come to naught.” <span
id="fr_2885"></span>[2886](#fn_2885.md)   I wept many tears over my
miserable life and I prayed that guidance might be vouchsafed me to
admit me to the doctrines of true religion.  First of all was I minded
to make some mending of my ways, long perverted as they were by my
intimacy with wicked men.  Then I read the Gospel, and I saw there that
a great means of reaching perfection was the selling of one’s goods, the
sharing them with the poor, the giving up of all care for this life, and
the refusal to allow the soul to be turned by any sympathy to things of
earth.  And I prayed that I might find some one of the brethren who had
chosen this way of life, that with him I might cross life’s short <span
id="fr_2886"></span>[2887](#fn_2886.md) and troubled strait.  And many did
I find in Alexandria, and many in the rest of Egypt, and others in
Palestine, and in Cœle Syria, and in Mesopotamia.  I admired their
continence in living, and their endurance in toil; I was amazed at their
persistency in prayer, and at their triumphing over sleep; subdued by no
natural necessity, ever keeping their souls’ purpose high and free, in
hunger, in thirst, in cold, in nakedness, <span
id="fr_2887"></span>[2888](#fn_2887.md) they never yielded to the body;
they were never willing to waste attention on it; always, as though
living in a flesh that was not theirs, they shewed in very deed what it
is to sojourn for a while in this life, <span
id="fr_2888"></span>[2889](#fn_2888.md) and what to have one’s citizenship
and home in heaven. <span id="fr_2889"></span>[2890](#fn_2889.md)   All
this moved my admiration.  I called these men’s lives blessed, in that
they did in deed shew that they “bear about in their body the dying of
Jesus.” <span id="fr_2890"></span>[2891](#fn_2890.md)   And I prayed that
I, too, as far as in me lay, might imitate them.

<span id="ix.ccxxiv-p21"></span>3.  So when I beheld certain men in my
own country striving to copy their ways, I felt that I had found a help
to my own salvation, and I took the things seen for proof of things
unseen.  And since the secrets in the hearts of each of us are unknown,
I held lowliness of dress to be a sufficient indication of lowliness of
spirit; and there was enough to convince me in the coarse cloak, the
girdle, and the shoes of untanned hide. <span
id="fr_2891"></span>[2892](#fn_2891.md)   And though many were for
withdrawing me from their society, I would not allow it, because I saw
that they put a life of endurance before a life of pleasure; and,
because of the extraordinary excellence of their lives, I became an
eager supporter of them.  And so it came about that I would not hear of
any fault being found with their doctrines, although many maintained
that their conceptions about God were erroneous, and that they had
become disciples of the champion of the present heresy, and were
secretly propagating his teaching.  But, as I had never at any time
heard these things with my own ears, I concluded that those who reported
them were calumniators.  Then I was called to preside over the Church. 
Of the watchmen and spies, who were given me under the pretence of
assistance and loving communion, I say nothing, lest I seem to injure my
own cause by telling an incredible tale, or give believers an occasion
for hating their fellows, if I am believed.  This had almost been my own
case, had I not been prevented by the mercy of God.  For almost every
one became an object of suspicion to me, and smitten at heart as I was
by wounds treacherously inflicted, I seemed to find nothing in any man
that I could trust.  But so far there was, nevertheless, a kind of
intimacy kept up between us.  Once and again we held discussions on
doctrinal points. and apparently we seemed to agree and keep together. 
But they began to find out that I made the same statements concerning my
faith in God which they had always heard from me.  For, if other things
in me may move a sigh, this one boast at least I dare make in the Lord,
that never for one moment have I held erroneous conceptions about God,
or entertained heterodox opinions, which I have learnt later to change. 
The teaching about God which I had received as a boy from my blessed
mother and my grandmother Macrina, I have ever held with increased
conviction.  On my coming to ripe years of reason I did not shift my
opinions from one to another, but carried out the <span id="page_264">p.
264</span> <span id="ix.ccxxiv-Page_264"></span>principles delivered to
me by my parents.  Just as the seed when it grows is first tiny and then
gets bigger but always preserves its identity, not changed in kind
though gradually perfected in growth, so I reckon the same doctrine to
have grown in my case through gradually advancing stages.  What I hold
now has not replaced what I held at the beginning.  Let them search
their own consciences.  Let these men who have now made me the common
talk on the charge of false doctrine, and deafened all men’s ears with
the defamatory letters which they have written against me, so that I am
compelled thus to defend myself, ask themselves if they have ever heard
anything from me, differing from what I now say, and let them remember
the judgment seat of Christ.

<span id="ix.ccxxiv-p23"></span>4.  I am charged with blasphemy against
God.  Yet it is impossible for me to be convicted on the ground of any
treatise concerning the Faith, which they urge against me, nor can I be
charged on the ground of the utterances which I have from time to time
delivered by word of mouth, without their being committed to writing, in
the churches of God.  Not a single witness has been found to say that he
has ever heard from me, when speaking in private, anything contrary to
true religion.  If then I am not an unorthodox writer, if no fault can
be found with my preaching, if I do not lead astray those who converse
with me in my own home, on what ground am I being judged?  But there is
a new invention!  Somebody, <span id="fr_2892"></span>[2893](#fn_2892.md)
runs the charge, in Syria has written something inconsistent with true
religion; and twenty years or more ago you wrote him a letter:  so you
are an accomplice of the fellow, and what is urged against him is urged
against you.  O truth-loving sir, I reply, you who have been taught that
lies are the offspring of the devil; what has proved to you that I wrote
that letter?  You never sent; you never asked; you were never informed
by me, who might have told you the truth.  But if the letter was mine,
how do you know that the document that has come into your hands now is
of the same date as my letter?  Who told you that it is twenty years
old?  How do you know that it is a composition of the man to whom my
letter was sent?  And if he was the composer, and I wrote to him, and my
letter and his composition belong to the same date, what proof is there
that I accepted it in my judgment, and that I hold those views?

<span id="ix.ccxxiv-p25"></span>5.  Ask yourself.  How often did you
visit me in my monastery on the Iris, when my very God-beloved brother
Gregory was with me, following the same course of life as myself?  Did
you ever hear anything of the kind?  Was there any appearance of such a
thing, small or great?  How many days did we spend in the opposite
village, at my mother’s, living as friend with friend, and discoursing
together night and day?  Did you ever find me holding any opinion of the
kind?  And when we went together to visit the blessed Silvanus, <span
id="fr_2893"></span>[2894](#fn_2893.md) did we not talk of these things on
the way?  And at Eusinoe, <span id="fr_2894"></span>[2895](#fn_2894.md)
when you were about to set out with other bishops for Lampsacus, <span
id="fr_2895"></span>[2896](#fn_2895.md) was not our discourse about the
faith?  Were not your shorthand writers at my side the whole time while
I was dictating my objections to the heresy?  Were not your most
faithful disciples there too?  When I was visiting the brotherhood, and
passing the night with them in their prayers, continually speaking and
hearing of the things pertaining to God without dispute, was not the
evidence which I gave of my sentiments exact and definite?  How came you
then to reckon this rotten and slender suspicion as of more importance
than the experience of such a length of time?

<span id="ix.ccxxiv-p29"></span>What evidence of my frame of mind ought
you to have preferred to your own?  Has there been the slightest want of
harmony in my utterances about the faith at Chalcedon, again and again
at Heraclea, and at an earlier period in the suburb of Cæsarea?  Are
they not all mutually consistent?  I only except the increase in force
of which I spoke just now, resulting from advance, and which is not to
be regarded as a change from worse to better, but rather as a filling up
of what was wanting in the addition of knowledge.  How can you fail to
bear in mind that the father shall not bear the iniquity of the son, nor
the son bear the iniquity of the father, but each shall die in his own
sin? <span id="fr_2896"></span>[2897](#fn_2896.md)   I have neither father
nor son slandered by you; I have had neither teacher nor disciple.  But
if the sins of the parents must be made charges against their children,
it is far fairer for the sins of Arius to be charged against his
disciples; and, whoever begat the heretic Aetius, <span
id="fr_2897"></span>[2898](#fn_2897.md) for the charges against the son to
be applied to the father.  If on the other <span id="page_265">p.
265</span> <span id="ix.ccxxiv-Page_265"></span>hand it is unjust for
any one to be accused for their sakes, it is far more unjust that I
should be held responsible for the sake of men with whom I have nothing
to do, even if they were in every respect sinners, and something worthy
of condemnation has been written by them.  I must be pardoned if I do
not believe all that is urged against them. since my own experience
shows me how very easy it is for accusers to slip into slander.

<span id="ix.ccxxiv-p32"></span>6.  Even if they did come forward to
accuse me, because they had been deceived, and thought that I was
associated with the writers of those words of Sabellius which they are
carrying about, they were guilty of unpardonable conduct in straightway
attacking and wounding me, when I had done them no wrong, before they
had obtained plain proof.  I do not like to speak of myself as bound to
them in the closest intimacy; or of them as being evidently not led by
the Holy Spirit, because of their cherishing false suspicions.  Much
anxious thought must be taken, and many sleepless nights must be passed,
and with many tears must the truth be sought from God, by him who is on
the point of cutting himself off from a brother’s friendship.  Even the
rulers of this world, when they are on the point of sentencing some evil
doer to death, draw the veil aside, <span
id="fr_2898"></span>[2899](#fn_2898.md) and call in experts for the
examination of the case, and consume considerable time in weighing the
severity of the law against the common fault of humanity, and with many
a sigh and many a lament for the stern necessity of the case, proclaim
before all the people that they are obeying the law from necessity, and
not passing sentence to gratify their own wishes. <span
id="fr_2899"></span>[2900](#fn_2899.md)   How much greater care and
diligence, how much more counsel, ought to be taken by one who is on the
point of breaking off from long established friendship with a brother! 
In this case there is only a single letter and that of doubtful
genuineness.  It would be quite impossible to argue that it is known by
the signature, for they possess not the original, but only a copy.  They
depend on one single document and that an old one.  It is now twenty
years since anything has been written to that person. <span
id="fr_2900"></span>[2901](#fn_2900.md)   Of my opinions and conduct in the
intervening time I can adduce no better witnesses than the very men who
attack and accuse me.

<span id="ix.ccxxiv-p36"></span>7.  But the real reason of separation is
not this letter.  There is another cause of alienation.  I am ashamed to
mention it; and I would have been for ever silent about it had not
recent events compelled me to publish all their mind for the sake of the
good of the mass of the people.  Good men have thought that communion
with me was a bar to the recovery of their authority.  Some have been
influenced by the signature of a certain creed which I proposed to them,
not that I distrusted their sentiments, I confess, but because I wished
to do away with the suspicions which the more part of the brethren who
agree with me entertained of them.  Accordingly, to avoid anything
arising from that confession to prevent their being accepted by the
present authorities, <span id="fr_2901"></span>[2902](#fn_2901.md) they
have renounced communion with me.  This letter was devised by an
after-thought as a pretext for the separation.  A very plain proof of
what I say is, that after they had denounced me, and composed such
complaints against me as suited them, they sent round their letters in
all directions before communicating with me.  Their letter was in the
possession of others who had received it in the course of transmission
and who were on the point of sending it on seven days before it had
reached my hands.  The idea was that it would be handed from one to
another and so would be quickly distributed over the whole country. 
This was reported to me at the time by those who were giving me clear
information of all their proceedings.  But I determined to hold my
tongue until the Revealer of all secrets should publish their doings by
plain and incontrovertible demonstration.

<span id="ix.ccxxiv-p33"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.ccxxiv-p33.1"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.ccxxiv-p33.2"></span>φέλκονται</span> .  So the Harl. <span
class="c14"><span id="ix.ccxxiv-p33.3"></span>ms.</span> for <span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.ccxxiv-p33.4"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.ccxxiv-p33.5"></span>φέλκονται</span>.  On
the sense which may be applied to either verb *cf*. Valesius on Am.
Marcellinus xviii. 2, whom the Ben. Ed. point out to be in error in
thinking that Basil’s idea is of drawing a curtain or veil over the
proceedings, and Chrysostom *Hom*. liv. *in Matt*.  <span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.ccxxiv-p33.6"></span>᾽</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.ccxxiv-p33.7"></span>Επὶ τοῖς δικασταῖς, ὅταν
δημοσί& 139· κρινωσι, τὰ παραπετάσματα συνελκύσαντες οἱ παρεστῶτες πᾶσιν
ἀυτοὺς δεικνύουσι</span>.  This meaning of *drawing* so as to *disclose*
is confirmed by Basil’s <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.ccxxiv-p33.8"></span>πάνδημοι πᾶσι γίγνονται</span> in this
passage and in *Hom. in Ps*. xxxii.

<span id="ix.ccxxiv-p34"></span> The Ben. note compares the praise
bestowed on Candidianus by Gregory of Nazianzus for trying cases in the
light of day (*Ep*. cxciv) and Am. Marcellinus xvii. 1, who says of
Julian, *Numerium Narconensis paulo ante rectorem, accusatum ut furem,
inusitato censorio vigore pro tribunali palam admissis volentibus
audiebat.*

<span id="fn_2900"></span>[265:2901](2080296.htm#fr_2900.md) <span

<span id="ix.ccxxiv-p35"></span> *i.e.* Apollinarius.

<span id="fn_2901"></span>[265:2902](2080296.htm#fr_2901.md) <span
id="ix.ccxxiv-p36.1"></span>

<span id="ix.ccxxiv-p37"></span> Though this phrase commonly means the
reigning emperor, as in *Letter* lxvi., the Ben. note has no doubt that
in this instance the reference is to Euzoius.  In *Letter* ccxxvi. § 3.
*q.v.*, Basil mentions reconciliation with Euzoius as the real object of
Eustathius’s hostility.  Euzoius was now in high favour with Valens.
