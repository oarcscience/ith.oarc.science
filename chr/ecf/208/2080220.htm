<p class="c20"><a name="ix.cxlviii-p5"></A><span class="c14"><a name="ix.cxlviii-p5.1"></A>Up</span> to this time I used to think Homer a fable, when I read the second part of his poem, in which he narrates the adventures of Ulysses.&#160; But the calamity which has befallen the most excellent Maximus has led me to look on what I used to think fabulous and incredible, as exceedingly probable.&#160; Maximus was governor of no insignificant people, just as Ulysses was chief of the Cephallenians.&#160; Ulysses had great wealth, and returned stripped of everything.&#160; To such straits has calamity reduced Maximus, that he may have to present himself at home in borrowed rags.&#160; And perhaps he has suffered all this because he has irritated some L&aelig;strygones against him, and has fallen in with some Scylla, hiding a dog&#146;s fierceness and fury under a woman&#146;s form.&#160; Since then he has barely been able to swim out of this inextricable whirlpool.&#160; He supplicates you by my means for humanity&#146;s sake to grieve for his undeserved misfortunes and not be silent about his needs, but make them known to the authorities.&#160; He hopes thus that he may find some aid against the slanders which have been got up against him:&#160; and if not, that at all events the intention of the enemy who has shewn such an intoxication of hostility against him may be made public.&#160; When a man has been wronged it is a considerable comfort to him if the wickedness of his enemies can be made plain.</p>
