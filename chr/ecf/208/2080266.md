id="ix.cxciv-p1.1"></span>Letter CXCIII. <span
id="fr_2678"></span>[2679](#fn_2678.md) </span>

<span id="ix.cxciv-p3"></span>*To Meletius the Physician*.

<span id="ix.cxciv-p4"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cxciv-p4.1"></span>I am</span> not able to flee from the
discomforts of winter so well as cranes are, although for foreseeing the
future I am quite as clever as a crane.  But as to liberty of life the
birds are almost as far ahead of me as they are in the being able to
fly.  In the first place I have been detained by certain worldly
business; then I have been so wasted by constant and violent attacks of
fever that there does seem something thinner even than I was,—I am <span
id="page_234">p. 234</span> <span id="ix.cxciv-Page_234"></span>thinner
than ever.  Besides all this, bouts of quartan ague have gone on for
more than twenty turns.  Now I do seem to be free from fever, but I am
in such a feeble state that I am no stronger than a cobweb.  Hence the
shortest journey is too far for me, and every breath of wind is more
dangerous to me than big waves to those at sea.  I have no alternative
but to hide in my hut and wait for spring, if only I can last out so
long, and am not carried off beforehand <span
id="fr_2679"></span>[2680](#fn_2679.md) by the internal malady of which I
am never rid.  If the Lord saves me with His mighty hand, I shall gladly
betake myself to your remote region, and gladly embrace a friend so
dear.  Only pray that my life may be ordered as may be best for my
soul’s good.

better authority, but is bad Greek, and makes worse sense.
