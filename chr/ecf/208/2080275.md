id="ix.cciii-p1.1"></span>Letter CCII. <span
id="fr_2724"></span>[2725](#fn_2724) </span>

<span id="ix.cciii-p3"></span>*To Amphilochius, bishop of Iconium*.

<span id="ix.cciii-p4"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cciii-p4.1"></span>Under</span> other circumstances I should
think it a special privilege to meet with your reverence, but above all
now, when the business which brings us together is of such great
importance.  But so much of my illness as still clings to me is enough
to prevent my stirring ever so short a distance.  I tried to drive as
far as the martyrs <span id="fr_2725"></span>[2726](#fn_2725) and had a
relapse almost into my old state.  You must therefore forgive me.  If
the matter can be put off for a few days, I will, by God’s grace join
you, and share your anxieties.  If the business presses, do, by God’s
help, what has to be done; but reckon me as present with you and as
participating in your worthy deeds.  May you, by the grace of the Holy
One, be preserved to God’s Church, strong and joyous in the Lord, and
praying for me.

<span id="ix.cciii-p5"></span> Tillemont conjectures that the drive was
to St. Eupsychius, but the day of St. Eupsychius fell in September,
which the Ben. note thinks too late for the date of this letter.  The
memorials of St. Julitta and St. Gordius were also near Cæsarea, but
their days fell in January, which the same note thinks too early. 
Gregory of Nyssa (Migne iii. p. 653) says that there were more altars in
Cappadocia than in all the world, so that we need have no difficulty in
supposing some saint whose date would synchronize with the letter. 
Basil, however, may have tried to drive to the shrine of some martyr on
some other day than the anniversary of his death.
