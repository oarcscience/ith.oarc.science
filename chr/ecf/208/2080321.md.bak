id="ix.ccxlix-p1.1"></span>Letter CCXLVIII. <span
id="fr_3086"></span>[3087](#fn_3086.md) </span>

<span id="ix.ccxlix-p3"></span>To Amphilochius, bishop of Iconium.

<span id="ix.ccxlix-p4"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.ccxlix-p4.1"></span>So</span> far as my own wishes are concerned
I am grieved at living at such a distance from your reverence.  But, as
regards the peace of your own life, I thank the Lord Who has kept you
out of this conflagration which has specially ravaged my diocese.  For
the just Judge has sent me, in accordance with my works, a messenger of
Satan, <span id="fr_3087"></span>[3088](#fn_3087.md) who is buffeting
me <span id="fr_3088"></span>[3089](#fn_3088.md) severely enough, and is
vigorously defending the heresy.  Indeed to such a pitch has he carried
the war against us, that he does not shrink even from shedding the blood
of those who trust in God.  You cannot fail to have heard that a man of
the name of Asclepius, <span id="fr_3089"></span>[3090](#fn_3089.md)
because he would not consent to communion with Doeg, <span
id="fr_3090"></span>[3091](#fn_3090.md) has died under the blows inflicted
on him by them, or rather, by their blows has been translated into
life.  You may suppose that the rest of their doings are of a piece with
this; the persecutions of presbyters and teachers, and all that might be
expected to be done by men abusing the imperial authority at their own
caprice.  But, in answer to your prayers, the Lord will give us release
from these things, and patience to bear the weight of our trials
worthily of our hope in Him.  Pray write frequently to me of all that
concerns yourself.  If you find any one who can be trusted to carry you
the book that I have finished, be so kind as to send for it, that so,
when I have been cheered by your approval, I may send it on to others
also.  By the grace of the Holy One may you be granted to me and to the
Church of the Lord in good health rejoicing in the Lord, and praying for
me.

<span id="ix.ccxlix-p6"></span> The word <span class="Greek"><span

Æschines) is a synonym, slightly strengthened, for the <span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.ccxlix-p6.2"></span>κολαφίζω</span> of St.
Paul.  St. Basil seems plainly to have the passage quoted in his mind.
