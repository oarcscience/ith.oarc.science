<span id="ix.xxv-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.xxv-p1.1"></span>Letter XXIV. <span
id="fr_1979"></span>[1980](#fn_1979) </span>

<span id="ix.xxv-p3"></span>*To Athanasius, father of Athanasius bishop
of Ancyra*. <span id="fr_1980"></span>[1981](#fn_1980)

<span id="ix.xxv-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.xxv-p5.1"></span>That</span> one of the things hardest to
achieve, if indeed it be not impossible, is to rise superior to calumny,
I am myself fully persuaded, and so too, I presume, is your excellency. 
Yet not to give a handle by one’s own conduct, either to inquisitive
critics of society, or to mischief makers who lie in wait to catch us
tripping, is not only possible, but is the special characteristic of all
who order their lives wisely and according to the rule of true
religion.  And do not think me so simple and credulous as to accept
depreciatory remarks from any one without due investigation.  I bear in
mind the admonition of the Spirit, “Thou shalt not receive a false
report.” <span id="fr_1981"></span>[1982](#fn_1981)   But you, learned
men, yourselves say that “The seen is significant of the unseen.”  I
therefore beg;—(and pray do not take it ill if I seem to be speaking as
though I were giving a lesson; for “God has chosen the weak” and
“despised things of the world,” <span
id="fr_1982"></span>[1983](#fn_1982) and often by their means brings
about the salvation of such as are being saved); what I say and urge is
this; that by word and deed we act with scrupulous attention to
propriety, and, in accordance with the apostolic precept, “give no
offence in anything.” <span id="fr_1983"></span>[1984](#fn_1983)   The
life of one who has toiled hard in the acquisition of knowledge, who has
governed cities and states, and who is jealous of the high character of
his forefathers, ought to be an example of high character itself.  You
ought not now to be exhibiting your disposition towards your children in
word only, as you have long exhibited its ever since you became a
father; you ought not only to shew that natural affection which is shewn
by brutes, as you yourself have said, and as experience shews.  You
ought to make your love go further, and be a love all the more personal
and voluntary in that you see your children worthy of a father’s
prayers.  On this point I do not need to be convinced.  The evidence of
facts is enough.  One thing, however, I will say for truth’s sake, that
it is not our brother Timotheus, the Chorepiscopus, who has brought me
word of what is noised abroad.  For neither by word of mouth nor by
letter has he ever conveyed anything in the shape of slander, be it
small or great.  That I have heard something I do not deny, but it is
not Timotheus who accuses you.  Yet while I hear whatever I do, at least
I will follow the example of Alexander, and will keep one ear clear for
the accused. <span id="fr_1984"></span>[1985](#fn_1984)
