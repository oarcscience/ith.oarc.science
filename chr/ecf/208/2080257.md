id="fr_2600"></span>[2601](#fn_2600.md) </span>

<span id="ix.clxxxv-p3"></span>*To Eustathius, bishop of
Himmeria*. <span id="fr_2601"></span>[2602](#fn_2601.md)

<span id="ix.clxxxv-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.clxxxv-p5.1"></span>Orphanhood</span> is, I know, very dismal,
and entails a great deal of work, because it deprives us of those who
are set over us.  Whence I conclude that you do not write to me, because
you are depressed at what has happened to you, and at the same time are
now very much occupied in visiting the folds of Christ, because they are
attacked on every side by foes.  But every grief finds consolation in
communication with sympathising friends.  Do then, I beg you, as often
as you can, write to me.  You will both refresh yourself by speaking to
me, and you will comfort me by letting me hear from you.  I shall
endeavour to do the same to you, as often as my work lets me.  Pray
yourself, and entreat all the brotherhood earnestly to importune the
Lord, to grant us one day release from the present distress.
