<span id="ix.cxcii-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.cxcii-p1.1"></span>Letter CXCI. <span
id="fr_2670"></span>[2671](#fn_2670.md) </span>

<span id="ix.cxcii-p3"></span>*To Amphilochius, bishop of
Iconium*. <span id="fr_2671"></span>[2672](#fn_2671.md)

<span id="ix.cxcii-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cxcii-p5.1"></span>On</span> reading the letter of your reverence
I heartily thanked God.  I did so because I found in your expressions
traces of ancient affection.  You are not like the majority.  You did
not persist in refusing to begin an affectionate correspondence.  You
have learned the greatness of the prize promised to the saints for
humility, and so you have chosen, by taking the second place, to get
before me.  Among Christians such are the conditions of victory, and it
is he who is content to take the second place who wins a crown.  But I
must not be behindhand in this virtuous rivalry, and so I thus salute
your reverence in return; and inform you as to how I am minded, in that,
since agreement in the faith is established among us, <span
id="fr_2672"></span>[2673](#fn_2672.md) there is nothing further to prevent
our being one body and one spirit, as we have been called in one hope of
our calling. <span id="fr_2673"></span>[2674](#fn_2673.md)   It is for you,
then, of your charity to follow up a good beginning to rally men of like
mind to stand at your side, and to appoint both time and place for
meeting.  Thus, by God’s grace, through mutual accommodation we may
govern the Churches by the ancient kind of love; receiving as our own
members brothers coming from the other side, sending as to our kin, and
in turn receiving as from our own kin.  Such, indeed, was once the boast
of the Church.  Brothers from each Church, travelling from one end of
the world to the other, were provided with little tokens, and found all
men fathers and brothers.  This is a privilege whereof, like all the
rest, the enemy of Christ’s Churches has robbed us.  We are confined
each in his own city, and every one looks at his neighbour with
distrust.  What more is to be said but that our love has grown
cold, <span id="fr_2674"></span>[2675](#fn_2674.md) whereby alone our Lord
has told us that His disciples are distinguished? <span
id="fr_2675"></span>[2676](#fn_2675.md)   First of all, if you will, do you
become known to one another, that I may know with whom I am to be in
agreement.  Thus by common consent we will fix on some place convenient
to both, and, at a season suitable for travelling, we will hasten to
meet one another; the Lord will direct us in the way.  Farewell.  Be of
good cheer.  Pray for me.  May you be granted to me by the grace of the
Holy One? <span id="fr_2676"></span>[2677](#fn_2676.md)

<span id="ix.cxcii-p10"></span> Whether the proposed meeting took place,
and, indeed, what meeting is referred to, cannot be determined.  Basil
met Amphilochius and some neighbouring bishops in Pisidia in 375.  But
before this he counts the Isaurians as already in communion with him
(*Letter* cciv.).  Perhaps all that the meeting was desired to bring
about was effected by correspondence.  This is the explanation of the
Ben. Ed.
