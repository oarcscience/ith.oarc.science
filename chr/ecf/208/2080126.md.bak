<span id="ix.liv-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.liv-p1.1"></span>Letter LIII. <span
id="fr_2191"></span>[2192](#fn_2191.md) </span>

<span id="ix.liv-p3"></span>*To the Chorepiscopi*. <span
id="fr_2192"></span>[2193](#fn_2192.md)

<span id="ix.liv-p8"></span>1.  <span class="c14"><span
id="ix.liv-p8.1"></span>My</span> soul is deeply pained at the enormity
of the matter on which I write, if for this only, that it has caused
general suspicion and talk.  But so far it has seemed to me incredible. 
I hope then that what I am writing about it may be taken by the guilty
as medicine, by the innocent as a warning, by the indifferent, in which
class I trust none of you may be found, as a testimony.  And what is it
of which I speak?  There is a report that some of you take money from
candidates for ordination, <span id="fr_2193"></span>[2194](#fn_2193.md)
and excuse it on grounds of religion.  This is indeed worse.  If any one
does evil under the guise of good he deserves double punishment; because
he not only does what is in itself not good, but, so to say, makes good
an accomplice in the commission of sin.  If the allegation be true, let
it be so no more.  Let a better state of things begin.  To the recipient
of the bribe it must be said, as was said by the Apostles to him who was
willing to give money to <span id="page_157">p. 157</span> <span
id="ix.liv-Page_157"></span>buy the fellowship of the Holy Ghost, “Thy
money perish with thee. <span id="fr_2194"></span>[2195](#fn_2194.md)   It
is a lighter sin to wish in ignorance to buy, than it is to sell, the
gift of God.  A sale it was; and if you sell what you received as a free
gift you will be deprived of the boon, as though you were yourself sold
to Satan.  You are obtruding the traffic of the huckster into spiritual
things and into the Church where we are entrusted with the body and
blood of Christ.  These things must not be.  And I will mention wherein
lies an ingenious contrivance.  They think that there is no sin because
they take the money not before but after the ordination; but to take is
to take at whatever time.

<span id="ix.liv-p11"></span>2.  I exhort you, then, abandon this gain,
or, I would rather say, this approach to Hell.  Do not, by defiling your
hands with such bribes, render yourselves unfit to celebrate holy
mysteries.  But forgive me.  I began by discrediting; and now I am
threatening as though I were convinced.  If, after this letter of mine,
any one do anything of the kind, he will depart from the altars here and
will seek a place where he is able to buy and to sell God’s gift.  We
and the Churches of God have no such custom. <span
id="fr_2195"></span>[2196](#fn_2195.md)   One word more, and I have done. 
These things come of covetousness.  Now covetousness is the root of all
evil and is called idolatry. <span id="fr_2196"></span>[2197](#fn_2196.md)
  Do not then price idols above Christ for the sake of a little money. 
Do not imitate Judas and once more betray for a bribe Him who was
crucified for us.  For alike the lands and the hands of all that make
such gain shall be called Aceldama. <span

<span id="ix.liv-p4"></span> “A class of ministers between bishops
proper and presbyters, defined in the Arabic version of the Nicene
canons to be ‘*loco episcopi super villas et monasteria et sacerdotes
villarum*;’ called into existence in the latter part of the third
century, and first in Asia Minor, in order to meet the wants of
episcopal supervision in the country parts of the now enlarged dioceses
without subdivision:  first mentioned in the Councils of Ancyra and
Neo-Cæsarea <span class="c14"><span id="ix.liv-p4.1"></span>a.d.</span>
314.” * D.C.A*. i. 354.  Three <span class="c14"><span
id="ix.liv-p4.2"></span>mss.</span> give the title “to the bishops under
him.”  The Ben. Ed. remarks:  “*Liquet Basilium agere de episcopis sibi
subditis.  Nam qui proprie dicebantur chorepiscopi, manus non ponebant,
sed clero inferiores ministros ascribebant, ut videre est in epist.
sequenti.  Sed tamen ipsi etiam episcopi, qui Ecclesias metropoli
subjectas regebant, interdum vocabuntur chorepiscopi.  Queritur enim
Gregorius Naz. in carmine De vita sua. quod a Basilio, qui quinquaginta
chorepiscopos sub se habebat, vilissimi oppiduli constitutus episcopus
fuisset.*
