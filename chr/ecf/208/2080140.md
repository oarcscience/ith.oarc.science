<span id="ix.lxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.lxviii-p1.1"></span>Letter LXVII. <span
id="fr_2241"></span>[2242](#fn_2241.md) </span>

<span id="ix.lxviii-p3"></span>*To Athanasius, bishop of Alexandria*.

<span id="ix.lxviii-p4"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.lxviii-p4.1"></span>In</span> my former letter it seemed to me
sufficient to point out to your excellency, that all that portion of the
people of the holy Church of Antioch who are sound in the faith, ought
to be brought to concord and unity.  My object was to make it plain that
the sections, now divided into several parts, ought to be united under
the God-beloved bishop Meletius.  Now the same beloved deacon,
Dorotheus, has requested a more distinct statement on these subjects,
and I am therefore constrained to point out that it is the prayer of the
whole East, and the earnest desire of one who, like myself, is so wholly
united to him, to see him in authority over the Churches of the Lord. 
He is a man of unimpeachable faith; his manner of life is incomparably
excellent, he stands at the head, so to say, of the whole body of the
Church, and all else are mere disjointed members.  On every ground,
then, it is necessary as well as advantageous, that the rest should be
united with him, just as smaller streams with great ones.  About the
rest, <span id="fr_2242"></span>[2243](#fn_2242.md) however, a certain
amount of management is needed, befitting their position, and likely to
pacify the people.  This is in keeping with your own wisdom, and with
your famous readiness and energy.  It has however by no means escaped
your intelligence, that this same course of procedure has already
recommended itself to the Westerns who are in agreement with you, as I
learn from the letters brought to me by the blessed Silvanus.
