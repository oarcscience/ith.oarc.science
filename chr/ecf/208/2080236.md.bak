id="ix.clxiv-p1.1"></span>Letter CLXIII. <span
id="fr_2545"></span>[2546](#fn_2545.md) </span>

<span id="ix.clxiv-p3"></span>*To Count Jovinus*.

<span id="ix.clxiv-p4"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.clxiv-p4.1"></span>One</span> can see your soul in your letter,
for in reality no painter can so exactly catch an outward likeness, as
uttered thoughts can image the secrets of the soul.  As I read your
letter, your words exactly characterized your steadfastness, your real
dignity, your unfailing sincerity; in all those things it comforted me
greatly though I could not see you.  Never fail, then, to seize every
opportunity of writing to me, and to give me the pleasure of conversing
with you at a distance; for to see you face to face I am now forbidden
by the distressing state of my health.  How serious this is you will
learn from the God-beloved bishop Amphilochius, who is both able to
report to you from his having been constantly with me, and fully
competent to tell you what he has seen.  But the only reason why I wish
you to know of my sufferings is, that you will forgive me for the
future, and acquit me of lack of energy, if I fail to come and see you,
though in truth my loss does not so much need defence from me as comfort
from you.  Had it been possible for me to come to you, I should have
very much preferred a sight of your excellency to all the ends that
other men count worth an effort.
