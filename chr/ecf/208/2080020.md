<span id="vi.ii.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.ii.iii-p1.1"></span>II.—Exegetic.</span>

<span id="vi.ii.iii-p2"></span>(i)  As of the *De Spiritu Sancto*, so of
the *Hexæmeron*, no further account need be given here.  It may,
however, be noted that the Ninth Homily ends abruptly, and the latter,
and apparently more important, portion of the subject is treated of at
less length than the former.  Jerome <span
id="fr_471"></span>[472](#fn_471.md) and Cassiodorus <span
id="fr_472"></span>[473](#fn_472.md) speak of nine homilies only on the
creation.  Socrates <span id="fr_473"></span>[474](#fn_473.md) says the
Hexæmeron was completed by Gregory of Nyssa.  Three orations are
published among Basil’s works, two on the creation of men and one on
Paradise, which are attributed to Basil by Combefis and Du Pin, but not
considered genuine by Tillemont, Maran, Garnier, Ceillier, and Fessler. 
They appear to be compositions which some editor thought congruous to
the popular work of Basil, and so appended them to it.

<span id="vi.ii.iii-p6"></span>The nine discourses in the Hexæmeron all
shew signs of having been delivered extempore, and the sequence of
argument and illustration is not such as to lead to the conclusion that
they were ever redacted by the author into exact literary form.  We
probably owe their preservation to the skilled shorthand writers of the
day. <span id="fr_474"></span>[475](#fn_474.md)

<span id="vi.ii.iii-p8"></span>(ii)  The Homilies on the Psalms as
published are seventeen in number; it has however been commonly held
that the second Homily on [Ps.
xxviii.](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#000.md)<span
id="vi.ii.iii-p8.1"></span> is not genuine, but the composition of some
plagiarist. The Homily also on [Ps.
xxxvii.](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#000.md)<span
id="vi.ii.iii-p8.2"></span> has been generally objected to.  These are
omitted from the group of the Ben. Ed., together with the first on [Ps.
cxiv.](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#000.md)<span
id="vi.ii.iii-p8.3"></span>, and that on cxv.  Maran <span
id="fr_475"></span>[476](#fn_475.md) thinks that none of these orations
shew signs of having been delivered in the episcopate, or of having
reference to the heresy of the Pneumatomachi; two apparently point
directly to the presbyterate.  In that on [Ps.
xiv.](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#000.md)<span id="vi.ii.iii-p9.1"></span>
he speaks of an <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ii.iii-p9.2"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ii.iii-p9.3"></span>μεριμνία</span> which would better befit
priest than the primate; on [Ps.
cxiv.](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#000.md)<span id="vi.ii.iii-p9.4"></span>
he describes himself as serving a particular church.  Both arguments
seem a little far-fetched, and might be opposed on plausible grounds. 
Both literal and allegorical interpretations are given.  If Basil is
found expressing himself in terms similar to those of Eusebius, it is no
doubt because both were inspired by Origen. <span
id="fr_476"></span>[477](#fn_476.md)   The Homily on [Psalm
i.](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#000.md)<span id="vi.ii.iii-p10.1"></span>
begins with a partial quotation from [2 Tim. iii.
16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#016.md)<span id="vi.ii.iii-p10.2"></span>,
“All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable,” and
goes on, “and was composed by the Spirit to the end that all of us men,
as in a general hospital for souls, may choose each what is best for his
own cure.”  For him, Scripture is supreme. <span
id="fr_477"></span>[478](#fn_477.md)   As is noticed on Hom. IX. <span
id="fr_478"></span>[479](#fn_478.md) of the Hexæmeron, Basil is on the
whole for the simpler sense.  But he was a student of Origen, and he
well knows <span id="page_xlv">p. xlv</span> <span
id="vi.ii.iii-Page_xlv"></span>how to use allegory when he thinks
fit. <span id="fr_479"></span>[480](#fn_479.md)   An example may be
observed in Letter VIII., <span id="fr_480"></span>[481](#fn_480.md) where
there is an elaborate allegorisation of the “times and the seasons” of
[Acts i. 7](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#007.md)<span
id="vi.ii.iii-p14.1"></span>.  An instance of the application of both
systems is to be found in the Homily on [Psalm
xxviii.](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#000.md)<span
id="vi.ii.iii-p14.2"></span> (*i.e*. in A.V. xxix.).  The LXX. Title is
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.ii.iii-p14.3"></span>Ψαλμὸς τᾥ Δαυὶδ
ἐξοδίου σκηνῆς</span>, *Psalmus David in exitu e tabernaculo*.” 
Primarily this is a charge delivered to the priests and Levites on
leaving their sacred offices.  They are to remember all that it is their
duty to prepare for the holy service.  As they go out of the Tabernacle
the psalm tells them all that it behoves them to have in readiness for
the morrow, young rams ([Ps. xxix.
1](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#001.md)<span id="vi.ii.iii-p14.4"></span>,
LXX.), glory and honour, glory for His name.  “But to our minds, as they
contemplate high and lofty things, and by the aid of an interpretation
dignified and worthy of Holy Scripture make the Law our own, the meaning
is different.  There is no question of ram in flock, nor tabernacle
fashioned of lifeless material, nor departure from the temple.  The
tabernacle for us is this body of ours, as the Apostle has told us in
the words, ‘For we that are in this tabernacle do groan.’ <span
id="fr_481"></span>[482](#fn_481.md)   The departure from the temple is our
quitting this life.  For this these words bid us be prepared, bringing
such and such things to the Lord, if the deeds done here are to be a
means to help us on our journey to the life to come.”

<span id="vi.ii.iii-p16"></span>This is in the style of exegesis
hitherto popular.  To hearers familiar with exegesis of the school of
Origen, it is an innovation for Basil to adopt such an exclusively
literal system of exposition as he does,—*e.g.* in Hom. IX. on the
Hexæmeron,—the system which is one of his distinguishing
characteristics. <span id="fr_482"></span>[483](#fn_482.md)   In his
common-sense literalism he is thus a link with the historical school of
Antioch, whose principles were in contrast with those of Origen and the
Alexandrians, a school represented by Theodore of Mopsuestia, Diodorus
of Tarsus, and later by Theodoret. <span
id="fr_483"></span>[484](#fn_483.md)

<span id="vi.ii.iii-p19"></span>It is remarked by Gregory of Nazianzus
in his memorial oration <span id="fr_484"></span>[485](#fn_484.md) that
Basil used a threefold method of enforcing Scripture on his hearers and
readers.  This may be understood to be the literal, moral, and
allegorical.  Ceillier points out that this description, so far as we
know, applies only to the Homilies on the Psalms.

<span id="vi.ii.iii-p21"></span>The praise of the Psalms, prefixed to
[Psalm i.](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#000.md)<span
id="vi.ii.iii-p21.1"></span>, is a passage of noticeable rhetorical
power and of considerable beauty.  Its popularity is shewn by the fact
of its being found in some manuscripts of St. Augustine, and also in the
commentary of Rufinus.  The latter probably translated it; portions of
it were transcribed by St. Ambrose. <span
id="fr_485"></span>[486](#fn_485.md)

<span id="vi.ii.iii-p23"></span>“The prophets,” says St. Basil, “the
historians, the law, give each a special kind of teaching, and the
exhortation of the proverbs furnishes yet another.  But the use and
profit of all are included in the book of Psalms.  There is prediction
of thing to come.  There our memories are reminded of the past.  There
laws are laid down for the guidance of life.  There are directions as to
conduct.  The book, in a word, is a treasury of sound teaching, and
provides for every individual need.  It heals the old hurts of souls,
and brings about recovery where the wound is fresh.  It wins the part
that is sick and preserves that which is sound.  As far as lies within
its power, it destroys the passions which lord it in this life in the
souls of men.  And all this it effects with a musical persuasiveness and
with a gratification that induces wise and wholesome reflexion.  The
Holy Spirit saw that mankind was hard to draw to goodness, that our
life’s scale inclined to pleasure, and that so we were neglectful of the
right.  What plan did He adopt?  He combined the delight of melody with
His teaching, to the end that by the sweetness and softness of what we
heard we might, all unawares, imbibe the blessing of the words.  He
acted like wise leeches, who, when they would give sour draughts to
sickly patients, put honey round about the cup.  So the melodious music
of the Psalms has been designed for us, that those who are boys in
years, or at least but lads in ways of life, while they seem to be
singing, may in reality be carrying on the education of the soul.  It is
not easy for the inattentive to retain in their memory, when they go
home, an injunction of an apostle or prophet; but the sayings of the
Psalms are sung in our houses and travel with us through the streets. 
<span id="page_xlvi">p. xlvi</span> <span
id="vi.ii.iii-Page_xlvi"></span>Let a man begin even to grow savage as
some wild beast, and no sooner is he soothed by psalm-singing than
straightway he goes home with passions lulled to calm and quiet by the
music of the song. <span id="fr_486"></span>[487](#fn_486.md)

<span id="vi.ii.iii-p25"></span>“A psalm is souls’ calm, herald of
peace, hushing the swell and agitation of thoughts.  It soothes the
passions of the soul; it brings her license under law.  A psalm is
welder of friendship, atonement of adversaries, reconciliation of
haters.  Who can regard a man as his enemy, when they have lifted up one
voice to God together?  So Psalmody gives us the best of all boons,
love.  Psalmody has bethought her of concerted singing as a mighty bond
of union, and links the people together in a symphony of one song.  A
psalm puts fiends to flight, and brings the aid of angels to our side;
it is armour in the terrors of the night; in the toils of the day it is
refreshment; to infants it is a protection, to men in life’s prime a
pride, to elders a consolation, to women an adornment.  It turns wastes
into homes.  It brings wisdom into marts and meetings.  To beginners it
is an alphabet, to all who are advancing an improvement, to the perfect
a confirmation.  It is the voice of the church.  It gladdens feasts.  It
produces godly sorrow.  It brings a tear even from a heart of stone.  A
psalm is angels’ work, the heavenly conversation, the spiritual
sacrifice.  Oh, the thoughtful wisdom of the Instructor Who designed
that we should at one and the same time sing and learn to our profit! 
It is thus that His precepts are imprinted on our souls.  A lesson that
is learned unwillingly is not likely to last, but all that is learned
with pleasure and delight effects a permanent settlement in our souls. 
What can you not learn from this source?  You may learn magnificent
manliness, scrupulous righteousness, dignified self-control, perfect
wisdom.  You may learn how to repent, and how far to endure.  What good
thing can you not learn?  There is a complete theology; <span
id="fr_487"></span>[488](#fn_487.md) a foretelling of the advent of Christ
in the flesh; threatening of judgment; hope of resurrection; fear of
chastisement; promise of glory; revelation of mysteries.  Everything is
stored in the book of the Psalms as in some vast treasury open to all
the world.  There are many instruments of music, but the prophet has
fitted it to the instrument called Psaltery.  I think the reason is that
he wished to indicate the grace sounding in him from on high by the gift
of the Spirit, because of all instruments the Psaltery is the only one
which has the source of its sounds above. <span
id="fr_488"></span>[489](#fn_488.md)   In the case of the cithara and the
lyre the metal gives forth its sound at the stroke of the plectrum from
below.  The Psaltery has the source of its melodious strains above.  So
are we taught to be diligent in seeking the things which are above, and
not to allow ourselves to be degraded by our pleasure in the music to
the lusts of the flesh.  And what I think the word of the Prophet
profoundly and wisely teaches by means of the fashion of the instrument
is this,—that those whose souls are musical and harmonious find their
road to the things that are above most easy.”

<span id="vi.ii.iii-p28"></span>*On* [Psa.
15](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#000.md)<span id="vi.ii.iii-p28.1"></span>*.
(in A.V. xv.) the commentary begins:*

<span id="vi.ii.iii-p29"></span>“Scripture, with the desire to describe
to us the perfect man, the man who is ordained to be the recipient of
blessings, observes a certain order and method in the treatment of
points in him which we may contemplate, and begins from the simplest and
most obvious, ‘Lord, who shall sojourn <span
id="fr_489"></span>[490](#fn_489.md) in thy tabernacle?’  A sojourning is a
transitory dwelling.  It indicates a life not settled, but passing, in
hope of our removal to the better things.  It is the part of a saint to
pass through this world, and to hasten to another life.  In this sense
David says of himself, ‘I am a stranger with thee and a sojourner, as
all my fathers were.’ <span id="fr_490"></span>[491](#fn_490.md)   Abraham
was a sojourner, who did not possess even so much land as to set his
foot on, and when he needed a tomb, bought one for money. <span
id="fr_491"></span>[492](#fn_491.md)   The word teaches us that so long as
he lives in the flesh he is a sojourner, and, when he removes from this
life, rests in his own home.  In this life he sojourns with strangers,
but the land which he bought in the tomb to receive his body is his
own.  And truly blessed is it, not to rot with things of earth as though
they were one’s own, nor cling to all that is about us here as through
here were our natural fatherland, but to be conscious of the fall from
nobler things, and of our passing our time in heaviness because of the
punishment that is laid upon us, just like exiles who for some crimes’
sake have been banished by the magistrates into regions far from the
land that gave them birth.  Hard it is to find a man who will not heed
present things as though they were his own; who knows that he has the
use of wealth but for a season; who <span id="page_xlvii">p.
xlvii</span> <span id="vi.ii.iii-Page_xlvii"></span>reckons on the brief
duration of his health; who remembers that the bloom of human glory
fades away.

<span id="vi.ii.iii-p33"></span>“‘Who shall sojourn in thy tabernacle?’ 
The flesh that is given to man’s soul for it to dwell in is called God’s
tabernacle.  Who will be found to treat this flesh as though it were not
his own?  Sojourners, when they hire land that is not their own, till
the estate at the will of the owner.  So, too, to us the care of the
flesh has been entrusted by bond, for us to toil with diligence therein,
and make it fruitful for the use of Him Who gave it.  And if the flesh
is worthy of God, it becomes verily a tabernacle of God, accordingly as
He makes His dwelling in the saints.  Such is the flesh of the
sojourner.  ‘Lord, who shall sojourn in Thy tabernacle?’  Then there
come progress and advance to that which is more perfect.  ‘And who shall
dwell in thy holy hill?’  A Jew, in earthly sense, when he hears of the
‘hill,’ turns his thoughts to Sion.  ‘Who shall dwell in thy holy
hill?’  The sojourner in the flesh shall dwell in the holy hill, he
shall dwell in that hill, that heavenly country, bright and splendid,
whereof the Apostle says, ‘Ye are come unto Mount Sion, and unto the
city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem,’ where is the general
assembly of  ‘angels, and church of the first-born, which are written in
heaven.’” <span id="fr_492"></span>[493](#fn_492.md)

<span id="vi.ii.iii-p35"></span>The Second Homily on [Psalm
xiv.](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#000.md)<span id="vi.ii.iii-p35.1"></span>
(xv.) has a special interest in view of the denunciation of usury alike
in Scripture and in the early Church.  The matter had been treated of at
Nicæa.  With it may be compared Homily VII., *De Avaritia.* <span
id="fr_493"></span>[494](#fn_493.md)

<span id="vi.ii.iii-p37"></span>After a few words of introduction and
reference to the former Homily on the same Psalm, St. Basil
proceeds;—“In depicting the character of the perfect man, of him, that
is, who is ordained to ascend to the life of everlasting peace, the
prophet reckons among his noble deeds his never having given his money
upon usury.  This particular sin is condemned in many passages of
Scripture.  Ezekiel <span id="fr_494"></span>[495](#fn_494.md) reckons
taking usury and increase among the greatest of crimes.  The law
distinctly utters the prohibition ‘Thou shalt not lend upon usury to thy
brother’ <span id="fr_495"></span>[496](#fn_495.md) and to thy neighbour. 
Again it is said, ‘Usury upon usury; guile upon guile.’ <span
id="fr_496"></span>[497](#fn_496.md)   And of the city abounding in a
multitude of wickednesses, what does the Psalm say?  ‘Usury and guile
depart not from her streets.’ <span id="fr_497"></span>[498](#fn_497.md)  
Now the prophet instances precisely the same point as characteristic of
the perfect man, saying, ‘He that putteth not out his money to
usury.’ <span id="fr_498"></span>[499](#fn_498.md)   For in truth it is the
last pitch of inhumanity that one man, in need of the bare necessities
of life, should be compelled to borrow, and another, not satisfied with
the principal, should seek to make gain and profit for himself out of
the calamities of the poor.  The Lord gave His own injunction quite
plainly in the words, ‘from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou
away.’ <span id="fr_499"></span>[500](#fn_499.md)   But what of the money
lover?  He sees before him a man under stress of necessity bent to the
ground in supplication.  He sees him hesitating at no act, no words, of
humiliation.  He sees him suffering undeserved misfortune, but he is
merciless.  He does not reckon that he is a fellow-creature.  He does
not give in to his entreaties.  He stands stiff and sour.  He is moved
by no prayers; his resolution is broken by no tears.  He persists in
refusal, invoking curses on his own head if he has any money about him,
and swearing that he is himself on the lookout for a friend to furnish
him a loan.  He backs lies with oaths, and makes a poor addition to his
stock in trade by supplementing inhumanity with perjury.  Then the
suppliant mentions interest, and utters the word security.  All is
changed.  The frown is relaxed; with a genial smile he recalls old
family connexion.  Now it is ‘my friend.’  ‘I will see,’ says he, ‘if I
have any money by me.  Yes; there is that sum which a man I know has
left in my hands on deposit for profit.  He named very heavy interest. 
However, I shall certainly take something off, and give it you on better
terms.’  With pretences of this kind and talk like this he fawns on the
wretched victim, and induces him to swallow the bait.  Then he binds him
with written security, adds loss of liberty to the trouble of his
pressing poverty, and is off.  The man who has made himself responsible
for interest which he cannot pay has accepted voluntary slavery for
life.  Tell me; do you expect to get money and profit out of the
pauper?  If he were in a position to add to your wealth, why should he
come begging at your door?  He came seeking an ally, and he found a
foe.  He was looking for medicine, and he lighted on poison.  You ought
to have comforted him in his distress, but in your attempt to grow fruit
on the waste you are aggravating his necessity.  Just as well might a
physician go in to his patients, and instead of restoring them to
health, rob them of the little strength they might have left.  This is
the way in which you try to profit by the misery of the wretched.  Just
as farmers pray for rain to make their fields fatter, so you are anxious
<span id="page_xlviii">p. xlviii</span> <span
id="vi.ii.iii-Page_xlviii"></span>for men’s need and indigence, that
your money may make more.  You forget that the addition which you are
making to your sins is larger than the increase to your wealth which you
are reckoning on getting for your usury.  The seeker of the loan is
helpless either way:  he bethinks him of his poverty, he gives up all
idea of payment as hopeless when at the need of the moment he risks the
loan.  The borrower bends to necessity and is beaten.  The lender goes
off secured by bills and bonds.

<span id="vi.ii.iii-p44"></span>“After he has got his money, at first a
man is bright and joyous; he shines with another’s splendour, and is
conspicuous by his altered mode of life.  His table is lavish; his dress
is most expensive.  His servants appear in finer liveries; he has
flatterers and boon companions; his rooms are full of drones
innumerable.  But the money slips away.  Time as it runs on adds the
interest to its tale.  Now night brings him no rest; no day is joyous;
no sun is bright; he is weary of his life; he hates the days that are
hurrying on to the appointed period; he is afraid of the months, for
they are parents of interest.  Even if he sleeps, he sees the lender in
his slumbers—a bad dream—standing by his pillow.  If he wakes up, there
is the anxiety and dread of the interest.  ‘The poor and the usurer,’ he
exclaims, ‘meet together:  the Lord lighteneth both their eyes.’ <span
id="fr_500"></span>[501](#fn_500.md)   The lender runs like a hound after
the game.  The borrower like a ready prey crouches at the coming
catastrophe, for his penury robs him of the power of speech.  Both have
their ready-reckoner in their hands, the one congratulating himself as
the interest mounts up, the other groaning at the growth of his
calamities.  ‘Drink waters out of thine own cistern.’ <span
id="fr_501"></span>[502](#fn_501.md)   Look, that is to say, at your own
resources; do not approach other men’s springs; provide your comforts
from your own reservoirs.  Have you household vessels, clothes, beast of
burden, all kinds of furniture?  Sell these.  Rather surrender all than
lose your liberty.  Ah, but—he rejoins—I am ashamed to put them up for
sale.  What then do you think of another’s bringing them out a little
later on, and crying your goods, and getting rid of them for next to
nothing before your very eyes?  Do not go to another man’s door.  Verily
‘another man’s well is narrow.’ <span id="fr_502"></span>[503](#fn_502.md)
  Better is it to relieve your necessity gradually by one contrivance
after another than after being all in a moment elated by another man’s
means, afterwards to be stripped at once of everything.  If you have
anything wherewith to pay, why do you not relieve your immediate
difficulties out of these resources?  If you are insolvent, you are only
trying to cure ill with ill.  Decline to be blockaded by an usurer.  Do
not suffer yourself to be sought out and tracked down like another man’s
game. <span id="fr_503"></span>[504](#fn_503.md)   Usury is the origin of
lying; the beginning of ingratitude, unfairness, perjury.…

<span id="vi.ii.iii-p49"></span>          .          .         
.          .          .          .          .          .         
.          .          .

<span id="vi.ii.iii-p50"></span>“But, you ask, how am I to live?  You
have hands.  You have a craft.  Work for wages.  Go into service.  There
are many ways of getting a living, many kinds of resources.  You are
helpless?  Ask those who have means.  It is discreditable to ask?  It
will be much more discreditable to rob your creditor.  I do not speak
thus to lay down the law.  I only wish to point out that any course is
more advantageous to you than borrowing.

<span id="vi.ii.iii-p51"></span>.          .          .

.          .

<span id="vi.ii.iii-p52"></span>“Listen, you rich men, to the kind of
advice I am giving to the poor because of your inhumanity.  Far better
endure under their dire straits than undergo the troubles that are bred
of usury!  But if you were obedient to the Lord, what need of these
words?  What is the advice of the Master?  Lend to those from whom ye do
not hope to receive. <span id="fr_504"></span>[505](#fn_504.md)   And what
kind of loan is this, it is asked, from all which all idea of the
expectation of repayment is withdrawn?  Consider the force of the
expression, and you will be amazed at the loving kindness of the
legislator.  When you mean to supply the need of a poor man for the
Lord’s sake, the transaction is at once a gift and a loan.  Because
there is no expectation of reimbursement, it is a gift.  Yet because of
the munificence of the Master, Who repays on the recipient’s behalf, it
is a loan.  ‘He that hath pity on the poor lendeth unto the Lord.’ <span
id="fr_505"></span>[506](#fn_505.md)   Do you not wish the Master of the
universe to be responsible for your repayment?  If any wealthy man in
the town promises you repayment on behalf of others, do you admit his
suretyship?  But you do not accept God, Who more than repays on behalf
of the poor.  Give the money lying useless, without weighting it with
increase, and both shall be benefited.  To you will accrue the security
of its safe keeping.  The recipients will have the advantage of its
use.  And if it is increase which you seek, <span id="page_xlix">p.
xlix</span> <span id="vi.ii.iii-Page_xlix"></span>be satisfied with that
which is given by the Lord.  He will pay the interest for the poor. 
Await the loving-kindness of Him Who is in truth most kind.

<span id="vi.ii.iii-p55"></span>“What you are taking involves the last
extremity of inhumanity.  You are making your profit out of misfortune;
you are levying a tax upon tears.  You are strangling the naked.  You
are dealing blows on the starving.  There is no pity anywhere, no sense
of your kinship to the hungry, and you call the profit you get from
these sources kindly and humane!  Wo unto them that ‘put bitter for
sweet, and sweet for bitter,’ <span id="fr_506"></span>[507](#fn_506.md)
and call inhumanity humanity!  This surpasses even the riddle which
Samson proposed to his boon companions:—‘Out of the eater came forth
meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness.’ <span
id="fr_507"></span>[508](#fn_507.md)   Out of the inhuman came forth
humanity!  Men do not gather grapes of thorns, nor figs of
thistles, <span id="fr_508"></span>[509](#fn_508.md) nor humanity of
usury.  A corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit. <span
id="fr_509"></span>[510](#fn_509.md)   There are such people as
twelve-per-cent-men and ten-per-cent-men:  I shudder to mention their
names.  They are exactors by the month, like the demons who produce
epilepsy, attacking the poor as the changes of the moon come
round. <span id="fr_510"></span>[511](#fn_510.md)

<span id="vi.ii.iii-p61"></span>“Here there is an evil grant to either,
to giver and to recipient.  To the latter, it brings ruin on his
property; to the former, on his soul.  The husbandman, when he has the
ear in store, does not search also for the seed beneath the root; you
both possess the fruit and cannot keep your hands from the principal. 
You plant where there is no ground.  You reap where there has been no
sowing.  For whom you are gathering you cannot tell.  The man from whom
usury wrings tears is manifest enough; but it is doubtful who is
destined to enjoy the results of the superfluity.  You have laid up in
store for yourself the trouble that results from your iniquity, but it
is uncertain whether you will not leave the use of your wealth to
others.  Therefore, ‘from him that would borrow of thee, turn not thou
away;’ <span id="fr_511"></span>[512](#fn_511.md) and do not give your
money upon usury.  Learn from both Old and New Testament what is
profitable for you, and so depart hence with good hope to your Lord; in
Him you will receive the interest of your good deeds,—in Jesus Christ
our Lord to Whom be glory and might for ever and ever, Amen.”

<span id="vi.ii.iii-p63"></span>(iii.)  *The Commentary on Isaiah*.  The
Commentary on Isaiah is placed by the Benedictine Editors in the
appendix of doubtful composition, mainly on the ground of inferiority of
style.  Ceillier is strongly in favour of the genuineness of this work,
and calls attention to the fact that it is attested by strong manuscript
authority, and by the recognition of St. Maximus, of John of Damascus,
of Simeon Logothetes, of Antony Melissa of Tarasius, and of the Greek
scholiast on the Epistles of St. Paul, who is supposed to be Œcumenius. 
Fessler <span id="fr_512"></span>[513](#fn_512.md) ranks the work among
those of doubtful authority on the ground of the silence of earlier
Fathers and of the inferiority of style, as well as of apparent
citations from the Commentary of Eusebius, and of some eccentricity of
opinion.  He conjectures that we may possibly have here the rough
material of a proposed work on Isaiah, based mainly on Origen, which was
never completed.  Garnier regards it as totally unworthy of St. Basil. 
Maran ( *Vit. Bas*. 42) would accept it, and refutes objections.

<span id="vi.ii.iii-p65"></span>Among the remarks which have seemed
frivolous is the comment on [Is. xi.
12](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#012.md)<span id="vi.ii.iii-p65.1"></span>,
that the actual cross of the Passion was prefigured by the four parts of
the universe joining in the midst. <span
id="fr_513"></span>[514](#fn_513.md)   Similar objections have been taken
to the statement that the devils like rich fare, and crowd the idols’
temples to enjoy the sacrificial feasts. <span
id="fr_514"></span>[515](#fn_514.md)   On the other hand it has been
pointed out that this ingenuity in finding symbols of the cross is of a
piece with that of Justin Martyr, <span
id="fr_515"></span>[516](#fn_515.md) who cites the yard on the mast, the
plough, and the Roman trophies, and that Gregory of Nazianzus <span
id="fr_516"></span>[517](#fn_516.md) instances the same characteristic of
the devils.  While dwelling on the holiness of character required for
the prophetic offices, the Commentary points out <span
id="fr_517"></span>[518](#fn_517.md) that sometimes it has pleased God to
grant it to Pharaoh and Nebuchadnezzar for the sake of their great
empires; to Caiaphas as the high priest; to Balaam, because of the
exigencies of the crisis at which he appeared.  The unchaste lad <span
id="fr_518"></span>[519](#fn_518.md) who has some great sin upon his
conscience shrinks from taking his place among the faithful, and is
ashamed to rank himself with the weepers.  So he tries to avoid the
examination of those whose duty it is to enquire into sins <span
id="fr_519"></span>[520](#fn_519.md) and he invents excuses for leaving the
church before the celebration of the mysteries.  The Commentary
urges <span id="fr_520"></span>[521](#fn_520.md) that without penitence the
best conduct is unavailing for salvation; that God requires of the
sinner not merely the abandonment <span id="page_l">p. l</span> <span
id="vi.ii.iii-Page_l"></span>of the sinful part, but also the amends of
penance, and warns men <span id="fr_521"></span>[522](#fn_521.md) that they
must not dream that the grace of baptism will free them from the
obligation to live a godly life.  The value of tradition is insisted
on. <span id="fr_522"></span>[523](#fn_522.md)   Every nation, as well as
every church, is said to have its own guardian angel. <span
id="fr_523"></span>[524](#fn_523.md)

<span id="vi.ii.iii-p79"></span>The excommunication reserved for certain
gross sins is represented <span id="fr_524"></span>[525](#fn_524.md) as a
necessary means enjoined by St. Paul to prevent the spread of
wickedness.  It is said <span id="fr_525"></span>[526](#fn_525.md) to be an
old tradition that on leaving Paradise Adam went to live in Jewry, and
there died; that after his death, his skull appearing bare, it was
carried to a certain place hence named “place of a skull,” and that for
this reason Jesus Christ, Who came to destroy death’s kingdom, willed to
die on the spot where the first fruits of mortality were interred. <span
id="fr_526"></span>[527](#fn_526.md)

<span id="vi.ii.iii-p86"></span>On [Is. v.
14](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#014.md)<span id="vi.ii.iii-p86.1"></span>,
“Hell hath enlarged herself, and opened her mouth without
measure,” <span id="fr_527"></span>[528](#fn_527.md) it is remarked that
these are figurative expressions to denote the multitude of souls that
perish.  At the same time an alternative literal meaning is admitted,
the mouth being the opening through which the souls of the damned are
precipitated into a dark region beneath the earth.

<span id="vi.ii.iii-p88"></span>It is noted in some <span
class="c14"><span id="vi.ii.iii-p88.1"></span>mss.</span> that the
Commentary was given to the world by an anonymous presbyter after St.
Basil’s death, who may have abstained from publishing it because it was
in an unfinished state.  Erasmus was the first to undertake to print it,
and to translate it into Latin but he went no further than the preface. 
It was printed in Paris in 1556 by Tilmann, with a lengthy refutation of
the objections of Erasmus. <span id="fr_528"></span>[529](#fn_528.md)

believed that tachygraphy was known from very early times, and Xenophon
is said to have “reported” Socrates by its aid.  The first plain mention
of a tachygraphist is in a letter of Flavius Philostratus (A.D. 195). 
It has been thought that the systems in use in the earlier centuries of
our era were modifications of a cryptographic method employed by the
Christians to circulate documents in the Church.  No examples are extant
of an earlier date than the tenth century, and of these an interesting
specimen is the Paris <span class="c14"><span
id="vi.ii.iii-p7.1"></span>MS.</span> of Hermogenes described by
Montfaucon, *Pal. Gr*. p. 351.  The exact minutes of some of the
Councils—*e.g*. Chalcedon—seem to be due to very successful tachygraphy.

<span id="vi.ii.iii-p13"></span> “*Origène sacrifiait tout au sens
mystique Eusèbe le faisait aller de pair avec le sens historique.  Comme
lui St. Basile respecte scrupuleusement la lettre; mais comme lui aussi,
il voit sous la lettre tous les mystères du Nouveau Testament et surtout
des enseignements moraux.  Les différents caractères que présente son
interprétation sont un moyen presque infaillible de connaitre la date
des ses grands travaux exégétiques.  Aussi ne doit-on pas hésiter à
assigner aux premiêres années de sa retraite la composition du
commentaire d’Isaïe, dans lequel domine à peu près exclusivement
l’interpétation morale; à sa prêtrese celle des homilies sur les
Psaumes, où il donne une égale importance au sens moral et au sens
mystique, mais en leur sacrifiant sans cesse le sens littéral; à son
épiscopat, enfin. l’Hexaméron, qui, sans négliger les sens figurés,
s’attache surtout à donner une explication exacte de la lettre*.” 
Fialon, *Et. Hist*. p. 291.  The theory is suggestive, but I am not sure
that the prevalence of the literal or of the allegorical is not due less
to the period of the composition than to the objects the writer has in
view.

<span id="vi.ii.iii-p82"></span> The tradition that Adam’s skull was
found at the foot of the cross gave rise to the frequent representation
of a skull in Christian art.  Instances are given by Mr. Jameson, *Hist.
of our Lord*, i. 22.  Jeremy Taylor, (*Life of our Lord*, Part iii. §
xv.) quotes Nonnus (*In Joann*. xix. 17):

<span id="vi.ii.iii-p83"></span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ii.iii-p83.1"></span>Εἰσόκε χῶρον ἵκανε φατιζομένοιο
κρανίου</span>

<span id="vi.ii.iii-p84"></span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ii.iii-p84.1"></span>Αδὰμ πρωτογόνοιο φερώνυμον ἄντυγι
κόρσης.</span>

<span id="vi.ii.iii-p85"></span>*cf*. Origen, *In Matt. Tract*. 35, and
Athan, *De Pass. et Cruc*.  Jerome speaks of the tradition in reference
to its association with the words “As in Adam all die, so in Christ
shall all be made alive,” as “smooth to the ear, but not true.”  One
version of the tale was that Noah took Adam’s bones with him in the ark;
that on Ararat they were divided, and the head fell to Seth’s share. 
This he buried at Golgotha.  *cf*. Fabricius i. 61.
