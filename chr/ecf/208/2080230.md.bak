id="ix.clviii-p5.1"></span>You</span> may well imagine how disappointed
I was not to meet you in the summer; not that our meeting in former
years was enough to satisfy me, but even to see loved objects in a dream
brings those who love some comfort.  But you do not even write, so
sluggish are you, and I think your absence can be referred to no other
cause than that you are slow to undertake journeys for affection’s
sake.  On this point I will say no more.  Pray for me, and ask the Lord
not to desert me, but as He has brought me out of bygone temptations so
also to deliver me from those that I await, for the glory of the name of
Him in Whom I put my trust.

Maran. (*Vit. Bas*). is of opinion that as these two letters, clvii. and
clviii., written at the same time, are very much in the same terms, they
cannot be to the same person, and thinks that the sluggishness, which
Basil complains of, fits with Eusebius much better than with Antiochus,
who could not travel without his uncle’s permission.
