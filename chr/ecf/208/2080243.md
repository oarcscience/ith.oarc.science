id="ix.clxxi-p1.1"></span>Letter CLXX. <span
id="fr_2563"></span>[2564](#fn_2563) </span>

<span id="ix.clxxi-p3"></span>*To Glycerius*.

<span id="ix.clxxi-p4"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.clxxi-p4.1"></span>How</span> far will your mad folly go?  How
long will you counsel mischief against yourself?  How long will you go
on rousing me to wrath, and bringing shame on the common order of
solitaries?  Return.  Put confidence in God, and in me, who imitate
God’s loving-kindness.  If I rebuked you like a father, like a father I
will forgive you.  This is the treatment you shall receive from me, for
many others are making supplication in your behalf, and before all the
rest your own presbyter, for whose grey hairs and compassionate
disposition I feel much respect.  Continue longer to hold aloof from me
and you have quite fallen from your degree. <span
id="fr_2564"></span>[2565](#fn_2564)   You will also fall away from God,
for with your songs and your garb <span
id="fr_2565"></span>[2566](#fn_2565) you are leading the young women not
to God, but to the pit.

<span id="ix.clxxi-p5"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.clxxi-p5.1"></span>τοῦ βαθμοῦ</span>.  *cf*. [1 Tim. iii.
13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#013)<span id="ix.clxxi-p5.2"></span>. 
<span class="Greek"><span id="ix.clxxi-p5.3"></span>οἱ καλῶς
διακονησαντες βαθμὸν ἑαυτοῖς καλὸν περιποιοῦνται</span>.  There seems an
evident allusion to this passage, but not such as to enable Basil to be
positively ranked with Chrysostom in his apparent interpretation of
<span class="Greek"><span id="ix.clxxi-p5.4"></span>βαθμός</span>
objectively of preferment, or with Theodoret in his subjective idea of
honour with God.  Apparently the “degree” is the Diaconate.

<span id="fn_2565"></span>[218:2566](2080243.htm#fr_2565) <span
id="ix.clxxi-p5.5"></span>

<span id="ix.clxxi-p6"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.clxxi-p6.1"></span>στολή</span>.  The technical use of this word
for a “stole” is not earlier than the ninth century.  It was indeed used
for a sacred vestment, *e.g.* the sacred robe which Constantine
presented to Macarius, Bishop of Jerusalem.  (Theodoret ii. 27.)  In
Latin “*stola*” designated the distinctive dress of the matron, and it
seems to be used with a suggestion of effeminacy.
