<span id="ix.cclxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.cclxviii-p1.1"></span>Letter CCLXVII. <span
id="fr_3212"></span>[3213](#fn_3212.md) </span>

<span id="ix.cclxviii-p3"></span>To Barses, bishop of Edessa, in exile.

<span id="ix.cclxviii-p4"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cclxviii-p4.1"></span>For</span> the sake of the affection which
I entertain for you, I long to be with you, to embrace you, my dear
friend, in person, and to glorify the Lord Who is magnified in you, and
has made your honourable old age renowned among all them that fear Him
throughout the world.  But severe sickness afflicts me, and to a greater
degree than I can express in words, I am weighed down by the care of the
Churches.  I am not my own master, to go whither I will, and to visit
whom I will.  Therefore I am trying to satisfy the longing I have for
the good gifts in you by writing to you, and I beseech your reverence to
pray for me and for the Church, that the Lord may grant to me to pass
the remaining days or hours of my sojourn here without offence.  May He
permit me to see the peace of His Churches.  Of your fellow-ministers
and fellow-athletes may I hear all that I pray for, and of yourself that
you are granted such a lot as the people under <span id="page_307">p.
307</span> <span id="ix.cclxviii-Page_307"></span>you seek for by day
and by night from the Lord of righteousness.  I have not written often,
not even so often as I ought, but I have written to your reverence. 
Possibly the brethren to whom I committed my greetings were not able to
preserve them.  But now that I have found some of my brethren travelling
to your excellency, I have readily entrusted my letter to them, and I
have sent some messages which I beg you to receive from my humility
without disdain, and to bless me after the manner of the patriarch
Isaac. <span id="fr_3213"></span>[3214](#fn_3213.md)   I have been much
occupied, and have had my mind drowned in a multiplicity of cares.  So
it may well be that I have omitted something which I ought to have
said.  If so, do not reckon it against me; and do not be grieved.  Act
in all things up to your own high character, that I, like every one
else, may enjoy the fruit of your virtue.  May you be granted to me and
to the Church, in good health, rejoicing in the Lord, praying for me.
