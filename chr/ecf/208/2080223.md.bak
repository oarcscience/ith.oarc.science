<span id="ix.cli-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.cli-p1.1"></span>Letter CL. <span
id="fr_2489"></span>[2490](#fn_2489.md) </span>

<span id="ix.cli-p3"></span>*To Amphilochius in the name of
Heraclidas*. <span id="fr_2490"></span>[2491](#fn_2490.md)

<span id="ix.cli-p5"></span>1.  <span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cli-p5.1"></span>I remember</span> our old conversations with one
another, and am forgetful neither of what I said, nor of what you said. 
And now public life has no hold upon me.  For although I am the same in
heart and have not yet put off the old man, nevertheless, outwardly and
by withdrawing myself far from worldly life, I seem already to have
begun to tread the way of Christian conversation.  I sit apart, like men
who are on the point of embarking on the deep, looking out at what is
before me.  Mariners, indeed, need winds to make their voyage
prosperous; I on the other hand want a guide to take me by the hand and
conduct me safely through life’s bitter waves.  I feel that I need first
a curb for my young manhood, and then pricks to drive me to the course
of piety.  Both these seem to be provided by reason, which at one time
disciplines my unruliness of soul, and at another time my sluggishness. 
Again I want other remedies that I may wash off the impurity of habit. 
You know how, long accustomed as I was to the Forum, I am lavish of
words, and do not guard myself against the thoughts put into my mind by
the evil one.  I am the servant too of honour, and cannot easily give up
thinking great things of myself.  Against all this I feel that I need a
great instructor.  Then, further, I conclude that it is of no small
importance, nor of benefit only for a little while, that the soul’s eye
should be so purged that, after being freed from all the darkness of
ignorance, as though from some blinding humour, one can gaze intently
<span id="page_208">p. 208</span> <span id="ix.cli-Page_208"></span>on
the beauty of the glory of God.  All this I know very well that your
wisdom is aware of; I know that you would wish that I might have some
one to give me such help, and if ever God grant me to meet you I am sure
that I shall learn more about what I ought to heed.  For now, in my
great ignorance, I can hardly even form a judgment as to what I lack. 
Yet I do not repent of my first impulse; my soul does not hang back from
the purpose of a godly life as you have feared for me, nobly and
becomingly doing everything in your power, lest, like the woman of whom
I have heard the story, I should turn back and become a pillar of
salt. <span id="fr_2491"></span>[2492](#fn_2491.md)   I am still, however,
under the restraint of external authority; for the magistrates are
seeking me like a deserter.  But I am chiefly influenced by my own
heart, which testifies to itself of all that I have told you.

<span id="ix.cli-p7"></span>2.  Since you have mentioned our bond, and
have announced that you mean to prosecute, you have made me laugh in
this my dejection, because you are still an advocate and do not give up
your shrewdness.  I hold, unless, indeed, like an ignorant man, I am
quite missing the truth, that there is only one way to the Lord, and
that all who are journeying to Him are travelling together and walking
in accordance with one “bond” of life.  If this be so, wherever I go how
can I be separated from you?  How can I cease to live with you, and with
you serve God, to Whom we have both fled for refuge?  Our bodies may be
separated by distance, but God’s eye still doubtless looks upon us both;
if indeed a life like mine is fit to be beheld by the divine eyes; for I
have read somewhere in the Psalms that the eyes of the Lord are upon the
righteous. <span id="fr_2492"></span>[2493](#fn_2492.md)   I do indeed pray
that with you and with all that are like minded with you, I may be
associated, even in body, and that night and day with you and with any
other true worshipper of God I may bow my knees to our Father which is
in heaven; for I know that communion in prayer brings great gain.  If,
as often as it is my lot to lie and groan in a different corner, I am
always to be accused of lying, I cannot contend against your argument,
and already condemn myself as a liar, if with my own carelessness I have
said anything which brings me under such a charge.

<span id="ix.cli-p9"></span>3.  I was lately at Cæsarea, in order to
learn what was going on there.  I was unwilling to remain in the city
itself, and betook myself to the neighbouring hospital, that I might get
there what information I wanted.  According to his custom the very godly
bishop visited it, and I consulted him as to the points which you had
urged upon me.  It is not possible for me to remember all that he said
in reply; it went far beyond the limits of a letter.  In sum, however,
what he said about poverty was this, that the rule ought to be that
every one should limit his possessions to one garment.  For one proof of
this he quoted the words of John the Baptist “he that hath two coats let
him impart to him that hath none;” <span
id="fr_2493"></span>[2494](#fn_2493.md) and for another our Lord’s
prohibition to His disciples to have two coats. <span
id="fr_2494"></span>[2495](#fn_2494.md)   He further added “If thou wilt be
perfect go and sell that thou hast and give to the poor.” <span
id="fr_2495"></span>[2496](#fn_2495.md)   He said too that the parable of
the pearl bore on this point, because the merchant, who had found the
pearl of great price, went away and sold all that he had and bought it;
and he added too that no one ought even to permit himself the
distribution of his own property, but should leave it in the hands of
the person entrusted with the duty of managing the affairs of the poor;
and he proved the point from the acts of the apostles, <span
id="fr_2496"></span>[2497](#fn_2496.md) because they sold their property
and brought and laid it at the feet of the apostles, and by them it was
distributed to each as every man had need. <span
id="fr_2497"></span>[2498](#fn_2497.md)   For he said that experience was
needed in order to distinguish between cases of genuine need and of mere
greedy begging.  For whoever gives to the afflicted gives to the Lord,
and from the Lord shall have his reward; but he who gives to every
vagabond casts to a dog, a nuisance indeed from his importunity, but
deserving no pity on the ground of want.

<span id="ix.cli-p15"></span>4.  He was moreover the first to speak
shortly, as befits the importance of the subject, about some of the
daily duties of life.  As to this I should wish you to hear from
himself, for it would not be right for me to weaken the force of his
lessons.  I would pray that we might visit him together, that so you
might both accurately preserve in your memory what he said, and supply
any omissions by your own intelligence.  One thing that I do remember,
out of the many which I heard, is this; that instruction how to lead the
Christian life depends less on words, than on daily example.  I know
that, if you had not been detained by the duty of succouring your aged
father, there is nothing that <span id="page_209">p. 209</span> <span
id="ix.cli-Page_209"></span>you would have more greatly esteemed than a
meeting with the bishop, and that you would not have advised me to leave
him in order to wander in deserts.  Caves and rocks are always ready for
us, but the help we get from our fellow man is not always at hand.  If,
then, you will put up with my giving you advice, you will impress on
your father the desirability of his allowing you to leave him for a
little while in order to meet a man who, alike from his experience of
others and from his own wisdom, knows much, and is able to impart it to
all who approach him.

<span id="ix.cli-p4"></span> Amphilochius, not yet consecrated to
Iconium, had abandoned his profession as an advocate, and was living in
retirement at Ozizala, a place not far from Nazianzus, the see of his
uncle Gregory, devoted to the care of his aged father, whose name he
bore.  Heraclidas, it appears, had also renounced the bar, and devoted
himself to religious life; but did not join Amphilochius on the ground
that he was living in Basil’s hospital at Cæsarea.  *cf*. the letters of
Gregory, first cousin of Amphilochius.  On the relationship, see Bp.
Lightfoot in *D.C.B.* i. p. 104, and pedigree in prolegomena.

in [Acts iv. 35](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#035.md)<span
id="ix.cli-p14.1"></span>.  “Distribution was made unto every man
according as he had need.”  In [Acts ii.
45](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#045.md)<span id="ix.cli-p14.2"></span> the
primitive communists are said themselves to have “parted to all men as
every man had need,” the responsibility of distribution being apparently
retained.
