<span id="ix.cxcix-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.cxcix-p1.1"></span>Letter CXCVIII. <span
id="fr_2689"></span>[2690](#fn_2689.md) </span>

<span id="ix.cxcix-p3"></span>*To Eusebius, bishop of Samosata*.

<span id="ix.cxcix-p4"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cxcix-p4.1"></span>After</span> the letter conveyed to me by the
officiales <span id="fr_2690"></span>[2691](#fn_2690.md) I have received
one other despatched to me later.  I have not sent many myself, for I
have not found any one travelling in your direction.  But I have sent
more than the four, among which also were those conveyed to me from
Samosata after the first epistle of your holiness.  These I have sealed
and sent to our honourable brother Leontius, peræquator of Nicæa, urging
that by his agency they may be delivered to the steward of the household
of our honourable brother Sophronius, that he may see to their
transmission to you.  <span id="page_236">p. 236</span> <span
id="ix.cxcix-Page_236"></span>As my letters are going through many
hands, it is likely enough that because one man is very busy or very
careless, your reverence may never get them.  Pardon me, then, I beseech
you, if my letters are few.  With your usual intelligence you have
properly found fault with me for not sending, as I ought, a courier of
my own when there was occasion for doing so; but you must understand
that we have had a winter of such severity that all the roads were
blocked till Easter, and I had no one disposed to brave the difficulties
of the journey.  For although our clergy do seem very numerous, they are
men inexperienced in travelling because they never traffic, and prefer
not to live far away from home, the majority of them plying sedentary
crafts, whereby they get their daily bread.  The brother whom I have now
sent to your reverence I have summoned from the country, and employed in
the conveyance of my letter to your holiness, that he may both give you
clear intelligence as to me and my affairs, and, moreover, by God’s
grace, bring me back plain and prompt information about you and yours. 
Our dear brother Eusebius the reader has for some time been anxious to
hasten to your holiness, but I have kept him here for the weather to
improve.  Even now I am under no little anxiety lest his inexperience in
travelling may cause him trouble, and bring on some illness; for he is
not robust.

<span id="ix.cxcix-p6"></span>2.  I need say nothing to you by letter
about the innovations of the East, for the brothers can themselves give
you accurate information.  You must know, my honoured friend, that, when
I was writing these words, I was so ill that I had lost all hope of
life.  It is impossible for me to enumerate all my painful symptoms, my
weakness, the violence of my attacks of fever, and my bad health in
general.  One point only may be selected.  I have now completed the time
of my sojourn in this miserable and painful life.
