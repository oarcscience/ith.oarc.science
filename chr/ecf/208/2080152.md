id="ix.lxxx-p1.1"></span>Letter LXXIX. <span
id="fr_2273"></span>[2274](#fn_2273.md) </span>

<span id="ix.lxxx-p3"></span>*To Eustathius bishop of Sebastia*. <span
id="fr_2274"></span>[2275](#fn_2274.md)

<span id="ix.lxxx-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.lxxx-p5.1"></span>Even</span> before receiving your letter I knew
what trouble you are ready to undergo for every one, and specially for
my humble self because I am exposed in this struggle.  So when I
received your letter from the reverend Eleusinius, and saw him actually
before my face, I praised God for bestowing on me such a champion and
comrade, in my struggles on behalf of true religion by the aid of the
Spirit.  Be it known to your exalted reverence that I have hitherto
sustained some attacks from high magistrates, and these no light ones;
while both the prefect and the high chamberlain pleaded with sympathy
for my opponents.  But, so far, I have sustained every assault unmoved,
by that mercy of God which supplies to me the aid of the Spirit, and
strengthens my weakness through Him.
