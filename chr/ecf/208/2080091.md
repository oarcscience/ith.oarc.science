id="ix.xix-p1.1"></span>Letter XVIII. <span
id="fr_1904"></span>[1905](#fn_1904.md) </span>

<span id="ix.xix-p3"></span>*To Macarius* <span

<span id="ix.xix-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.xix-p5.1"></span>The</span> labours of the field come as no
novelty to tillers of the land; sailors are not astonished if they meet
a storm at sea; sweats in the summer heat are the common experience of
the hired hind; and to them that have chosen to live a holy life the
afflictions of this present world cannot come unforeseen.  Each and all
of these have the known and proper labour of their callings, not chosen
for its own sake, but for the sake of the enjoyment of the good things
to which they look forward.  What in each of these cases acts as a
consolation in trouble is that which really forms the bond and link of
all human life,—hope.  Now of them that labour for the fruits of the
earth, or for earthly things, some enjoy only in imagination what they
have looked for, and are altogether disappointed; and even in the case
of others, where the issue has answered expectation, another hope is
soon needed, so quickly has the first fled and faded out of sight.  Only
of them that labour for holiness and truth are the hopes destroyed by no
deception; no issue can destroy their labours, for the kingdom of the
heavens that awaits them is firm and sure.  So long then as the word of
truth is on our side, never be in any wise distressed at the calumny of
a lie; let no imperial threats scare you; do not be grieved at the
laughter and mockery of your intimates, nor at the condemnation of those
who pretend to care for you, and who put forward, as their most
attractive bait to deceive, a pretence of giving good advice.  Against
them all let sound reason do battle, invoking the championship and
succour of our Lord Jesus Christ, the teacher of true religion, for Whom
to suffer is sweet, and “to die is gain.” <span
