id="ix.cccxxxii-p1.1"></span>Letter CCCXXXVII.</span>

<span id="ix.cccxxxii-p2"></span>Basil to Libanius.

<span id="ix.cccxxxii-p3"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cccxxxii-p3.1"></span>Lo</span> and behold, yet another
Cappadocian has come to you; a son of my own!  Yet my present position
makes all men my sons.  On this ground he may be regarded as a brother
of the former one, and worthy of the same attention alike from me his
father, and from you his instructor—if really it is possible for these
young men, who come from me, to obtain any further favours.  I do not
mean that it is not possible for your excellency to give anything more
to your old comrades, but because your services are so lavishly bestowed
upon all.  It will be sufficient for the lad before he gets experience
if he be numbered among those who are intimately known to you.  I trust
you may send him back to me worthy of my prayers and of your great
reputation in learning and eloquence.  He is accompanied by a young man
of his own age, and of like zeal for instruction; a youth of good
family, and closely associated with myself.  I am sure he will be in
every way as well treated, though his means are smaller than is the case
with the rest.
