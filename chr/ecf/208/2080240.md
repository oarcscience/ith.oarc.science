id="fr_2554"></span>[2555](#fn_2554) </span>

<span id="ix.clxviii-p3"></span>*To Eusebius, bishop of Samosata*.

<span id="ix.clxviii-p4"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.clxviii-p4.1"></span>I am</span> delighted at your remembering me
and writing, and, what is yet more important, at your sending me your
blessing in your letter.  Had I been but worthy of your labours and of
your struggles in Christ’s cause, I should have been permitted to come
to you and embrace you, and to take you as a model of patience.  But
since I am not worthy of this, and am detained by many afflictions and
much occupation, I do what is next best.  I salute your excellency, and
beseech you not to grow weary of remembering me.  For the honour and
pleasure of receiving your letters is not only an advantage to me, but
it is a ground of boasting and pride before the world that I should be
held in honour by one whose virtue is so great, and who is in such close
communion with God as to be able, alike by his teaching and example, to
unite others with him in it.
