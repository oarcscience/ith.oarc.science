id="fr_3084"></span>[3085](#fn_3084.md) </span>

<span id="ix.ccxlviii-p3"></span>To the Nicopolitans.

<span id="ix.ccxlviii-p4"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.ccxlviii-p4.1"></span>When</span> I had read the letter of your
holinesses, how did I not groan and lament that I had heard of these
further troubles, of blows and insults inflicted on yourselves, of
destruction of homes, devastation of the city, ruin of your whole
country, persecution of the Church, banishment; of priests, invasion of
wolves, and scattering of flocks.  But I have looked to the Lord in
heaven, and have ceased to groan and weep, because I am perfectly well
assured, as I hope you know too, that help will speedily come and that
you will not be for ever forsaken.  What we have suffered, we have
suffered for our sins.  But our loving Lord will show us His own aid for
the sake of His love and pity for the Churches.  Nevertheless, I have
not omitted to beseech men in authority in person.  I have written to
those at court, who love us, that the wrath of our ravening enemy may be
stayed.  I think, moreover, that from many quarters condemnation may
fall upon his head, unless indeed these troublous times allow our public
men no leisure for these matters. <span

<span id="ix.ccxlviii-p5"></span> It is rare to find in Basil’s letters
even so slight an allusion as this to the general affairs of the
empire.  At or about the date of this letter the Goths, hitherto kept in
subjection by the legions of Valens, were being driven south by the Huns
and becoming a danger to the empire.  Amm. Marc. xxxi. 4.  *Turbido
instantium studio, orbis Romani pernicies ducebatur.*
