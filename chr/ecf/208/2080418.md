<span id="ix.cccxlvi-p2"></span>Basil to Libanius.

<span id="ix.cccxlvi-p3"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cccxlvi-p3.1"></span>Many</span>, who have come to me from where
you are, have admired your oratorical power.  They were remarking that
there has been a very brilliant specimen of this, and a very great
contest, as they alleged, with the result that all crowded together, and
no one appeared in the whole city but Libanius alone in the lists, and
everybody, young and old, listening.  For no one was willing to be
absent—not a man of rank—not a distinguished soldier—not an artisan. 
Even women hurried to be present at the struggle.  And what was it? 
What was the speech which brought together this vast assembly?  I have
been told that it contained a description of a man of peevish temper. 
Pray lose no time in sending me this much admired speech, in order that
I too may join in praising your eloquence.  If I am a praiser of
Libanius without his works, what am I likely to become after receiving
the grounds on which to praise him?
