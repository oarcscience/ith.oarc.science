<span id="ix.ccxxxvi"></span>

<span id="ix.ccxxxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.ccxxxvi-p1.1"></span>Letter CCXXXV. <span
id="fr_2959"></span>[2960](#fn_2959.md) </span>

<span id="ix.ccxxxvi-p3"></span>To the same, in answer to another
question.

<span id="ix.ccxxxvi-p4"></span>1.  <span class="c14"><span
id="ix.ccxxxvi-p4.1"></span>Which</span> is first in order, knowledge or
faith?  I reply that generally, in the case of disciples, faith precedes
knowledge.  But, in our teaching, if any one asserts knowledge to come
before faith, I make no objec<span id="page_275">p. 275</span> <span
id="ix.ccxxxvi-Page_275"></span>tion; understanding knowledge so far as
is within the bounds of human comprehension.  In our lessons we must
first believe that the letter *a* is said to us; then we learn the
characters and their pronunciation, and last of all we get the distinct
idea of the force of the letter.  But in our belief about God, first
comes the idea that God is.  This we gather from His works.  For, as we
perceive His wisdom, His goodness, and all His invisible things from the
creation of the world, <span id="fr_2960"></span>[2961](#fn_2960.md) so we
know Him.  So, too, we accept Him as our Lord.  For since God is the
Creator of the whole world, and we are a part of the world, God is our
Creator.  This knowledge is followed by faith, and this faith by
worship.

<span id="ix.ccxxxvi-p6"></span>2.  But the word knowledge has many
meanings, and so those who make sport of simpler minds, and like to make
themselves remarkable by astounding statements (just like jugglers who
get the balls out of sight before men’s very eyes), hastily included
everything in their general enquiry.  Knowledge, I say, has a very wide
application, and knowledge may be got of what a thing is, by number, by
bulk, by force, by its mode of existence, by the period of its
generation, by its essence.  When then our opponents include the whole
in their question, if they catch us in the confession that we know, they
straightway demand from us knowledge of the essence; if, on the
contrary, they see us cautious as to making any assertion on the
subject, they affix on us the stigma of impiety.  I, however, confess
that I know what is knowable of God, and that I know what it is which is
beyond my comprehension. <span id="fr_2961"></span>[2962](#fn_2961.md)   So
if you ask me if I know what sand is, and I reply that I do, you will
obviously be slandering me, if you straightway ask me the number of the
sand; inasmuch as your first enquiry bore only on the form of sand,
while your second unfair objection bore upon its number.  The quibble is
just as though any one were to say, Do you know Timothy?  Oh, if you
know Timothy you know his nature.  Since you have acknowledged that you
know Timothy, give me an account of Timothy’s nature.  Yes; but I at the
same time both know and do not know Timothy, though not in the same way
and in the same degree.  It is not that I do not know in the same way in
which I do know; but I know in one way and am ignorant in one way.  I
know him according to his form and other properties; but I am ignorant
of his essence.  Indeed, in this way too, I both know, and am ignorant
of, myself.  I know indeed who I am, but, so far as I am ignorant of my
essence I do not know myself.

<span id="ix.ccxxxvi-p8"></span>3.  Let them tell me in what sense Paul
says, “Now we know in part”; <span id="fr_2962"></span>[2963](#fn_2962.md)
do we know His essence in part, as knowing parts of His essence?  No. 
This is absurd; for God is without parts.  But do we know the whole
essence?  How then “When that which is perfect is come, then that which
is in part shall be done away.” <span
id="fr_2963"></span>[2964](#fn_2963.md)   Why are idolaters found fault
with?  Is it not because they knew God and did not honour Him as God? 
Why are the “foolish Galatians” <span
id="fr_2964"></span>[2965](#fn_2964.md) reproached by Paul in the words,
“After that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye
again to the weak and beggarly elements?” <span
id="fr_2965"></span>[2966](#fn_2965.md)   How was God known in Jewry?  Was
it because in Jewry it was known what His essence is?  “The ox,” it is
said, “knoweth his owner.” <span id="fr_2966"></span>[2967](#fn_2966.md)  
According to your argument the ox knows his lord’s essence.  “And the
ass his master’s crib.” <span id="fr_2967"></span>[2968](#fn_2967.md)   So
the ass knows the essence of the crib, but “Israel doth not know me.” 
So, according to you, Israel is found fault with for not knowing what
the essence of God is.  “Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have
not known thee,” <span id="fr_2968"></span>[2969](#fn_2968.md) that is, who
have not comprehended thy essence.  But, I repeat, knowledge is
manifold—it involves perception of our Creator, recognition of His
wonderful works, observance of His commandments and intimate communion
with Him.  All this they thrust on one side and force knowledge into one
single meaning, the contemplation of God’s essence.  Thou shalt put
them, it is said, before the testimony and I shall be known of thee
thence. <span id="fr_2969"></span>[2970](#fn_2969.md)   Is the term, “I
shall be known of thee,” instead of, “I will reveal my essence”?  “The
Lord knoweth them that are his.” <span
id="fr_2970"></span>[2971](#fn_2970.md)   Does He know the essence of them
that are His, but is ignorant of the essence of those who disobey Him? 
“Adam knew his wife.” <span id="fr_2971"></span>[2972](#fn_2971.md)   Did
he know her essence?  It is said of Rebekah “She was a virgin, neither
had any man known her,” <span id="fr_2972"></span>[2973](#fn_2972.md) and
“How shall this be seeing I know not a man?” <span
id="fr_2973"></span>[2974](#fn_2973.md)   Did no man know Rebekah’s
essence?  Does Mary mean “I do not know the essence of any man”?  Is it
not the custom of Scripture to use the word “know” of nuptial embraces? 
The statement that God shall be <span id="page_276">p. 276</span> <span
id="ix.ccxxxvi-Page_276"></span>known from the mercy seat means that He
will be known to His worshippers.  And the Lord knoweth them that are
His, means that on account of their good works He receives them into
intimate communion with Him.
