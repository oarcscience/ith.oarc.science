<span id="ix.xxxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.xxxviii-p1.1"></span>Letter XXXVII. <span
id="fr_2019"></span>[2020](#fn_2019) </span>

<span id="ix.xxxviii-p3"></span>*Without address*.

<span id="ix.xxxviii-p4"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.xxxviii-p4.1"></span>I look</span> with suspicion on the
multiplication of letters.  Against my will, and because I cannot resist
the importunity of petitioners, I am compelled to speak.  I write
because I can think of no other means of relieving myself than by
assenting to the supplications of those who are always asking letters
from me.  I am really afraid lest, since many are carrying letters off,
one of the many be reckoned to be that brother.  I have, I own, many
friends and relatives in my own country, and I am placed *in loco
parentis* by the position <span id="fr_2020"></span>[2021](#fn_2020)
which the Lord has given me.  Among them is this my foster <span
id="page_137">p. 137</span> <span
id="ix.xxxviii-Page_137"></span>brother, son of my nurse, and I pray
that the house in which I was brought up may remain at its old
assessment, so that the sojourn among us of your excellency, so
beneficial to us all, may turn out no occasion of trouble to him.  Now
too I am supported from the same house, because I have nothing of my
own, but depend upon those who love me.  I do then entreat you to spare
the house in which I was nursed as though you were keeping up the supply
of support for me.  May God in return grant you His everlasting rest. 
One thing however, and it is most true, I think your excellency ought to
know, and that is that the greater number of the slaves were given him
from the outset by us, as an equivalent for my sustenance, by the gift
of my father and mother.  At the same time this was not to be regarded
as an absolute gift; he was only to have the use for life, so that, if
anything serious happen to him on their account, he is at liberty to
send them back to me, and I shall thus in another way be responsible for
rates and to collectors.

<span id="ix.xxxviii-p5"></span> By some supposed to be that of a
bishop; but Maran, who dates the letter before the episcopate, thinks
the use of the phrase is justified by our understanding the presbyterate
to be meant.  *Vide* Prolegomena.
