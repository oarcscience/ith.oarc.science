<span id="ix.cclxix-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.cclxix-p1.1"></span>Letter CCLXVIII. <span
id="fr_3214"></span>[3215](#fn_3214) </span>

<span id="ix.cclxix-p3"></span>To Eusebius, in exile.

<span id="ix.cclxix-p4"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cclxix-p4.1"></span>Even</span> in our time the Lord has taught
us, by protecting with His great and powerful hand the life of your
holiness, that He does not abandon His holy ones.  I reckon your case to
be almost like that of the saint remaining unhurt in the belly of the
monster of the deep, or that of the men who feared the Lord, living
unscathed in the fierce fire.  For though the war is round about you on
every side, He, as I hear, has kept you unharmed.  May the mighty God
keep you, if I live longer, to fulfil my earnest prayer that I may see
you!  If not for me, may He keep you for the rest, who wait for your
return as they might for their own salvation.  I am persuaded that the
Lord in His loving-kindness will give heed to the tears of the Churches,
and to the sighs which all are heaving over you, and will preserve you
in life until He grant the prayer of all who night and day are praying
to Him.  Of all the measures taken against you, up to the arrival of our
beloved brother Libanius the deacon, <span
id="fr_3215"></span>[3216](#fn_3215) I have been sufficiently informed
by him while on his way.  I am anxious to learn what happened
afterwards.  I hear that in the meanwhile still greater troubles have
occurred where you are; about all this, sooner if possible, but, if not,
at least by our reverend brother Paul the presbyter, on his return, may
I learn, as I pray that I may, that your life is preserved safe and
sound.  But on account of the report that all the roads are infested
with thieves and deserters, <span id="fr_3216"></span>[3217](#fn_3216) I
have been afraid to entrust anything to the brother’s keeping, for fear
of causing his death.  If the Lord grant a little quiet, (as I am told
of the coming of the army), I will try to send you one of my own men, to
visit you, to bring me back news of everything about you.
