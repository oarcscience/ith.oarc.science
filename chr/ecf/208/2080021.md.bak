<span id="vi.ii.iv"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.ii.iv-p1.1"></span>III.—Ascetic.</span>

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p2"></span>(i)  Of the works comprised under this
head, the first are the three compositions entitled *Tractatus Prævii. 
The first,* *Prævia Institutio ascetica* (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ii.iv-p2.1"></span>᾽</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ii.iv-p2.2"></span>Ασκητικὴ προδιατύπωσις</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.ii.iv-p2.3"></span> ), is an exhortation to
enlistment in the sacred warfare; the second, on renunciation of the
world and spiritual perfection, is the *Sermo asceticus* (</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.ii.iv-p2.4"></span>λόγος ἀσκητικός</span>). 
The third, *Sermo de ascetica disciplina* (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ii.iv-p2.5"></span>λόγος περὶ ἀσκήσεως, πῶς δει κοσμἑισθαι τὸν
μοναχόν</span>), treats of the virtues to be exhibited in the life of
the solitary.

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p3"></span>The first of the three is a commendation
less of monasticism than of general Christian endurance.  It has been
supposed to have been written in times of special oppression and
persecution.

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p4"></span>The second discourse is an exhortation to
renunciation of the world.  Riches are to be abandoned to the poor.  The
highest life is the monastic.  But this is not to be hastily and
inconsiderately embraced.  To renounce monasticism and return to the
world is derogatory to a noble profession.  The idea of pleasing God in
the world as well as out of it is, for those who have once quitted it, a
delusion.  God has given mankind the choice of two holy estates,
marriage or virginity.  The law which bids us love God more than father,
mother, or self, more than wife and children, is as binding in wedlock
as in celibacy.  Marriage indeed demands the greater watchfulness, for
it offers the greater temptations.  Monks are to be firm against all
attempts to shake their resolves.  They will do well to put themselves
under the guidance of some good man of experience and pious life,
learned in the Scriptures, loving the poor more than money, superior to
the seductions of flattery, and loving God above all things.  Specific
directions are given for the monastic life, and monks are urged to
retirement, silence, and the study of the Scriptures.

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p5"></span>The third discourse, which is brief, is a
summary of similar recommendations.  The monk ought moreover to labour
with his hands, to reflect upon the day of judgment, to succour the
sick, to practice hospitality, to read books of recognized genuineness,
not to dispute about the doctrine of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, but to
believe in and confess an uncreate and consubstantial Trinity.

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p6"></span>(ii)  Next in order come the *Proœmium de
Judicio Dei* (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ii.iv-p6.1"></span>προοίμιον περὶ κρίματος Θεοῦ</span>) and the
*De Fide* (<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.ii.iv-p6.2"></span>περὶ
πίστεως</span>).  These treatises were prefixed by Basil to the
*Moralia*.  He <span id="page_li">p. li</span> <span
id="vi.ii.iv-Page_li"></span>states that, when he enquired into the true
causes of the troubles which weighed heavily on the Church, he could
only refer them to breaches of the commandments of God.  Hence the
divine punishment, and the need of observing the Divine Law.  The
apostle says that what is needed is faith working by love.  So St. Basil
thought it necessary to append an exposition of the sound faith
concerning the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, and so pass in order
to morals. <span id="fr_529"></span>[530](#fn_529.md)   It has, however,
been supposed by some <span id="fr_530"></span>[531](#fn_530.md) that the
composition published in the plan as the *De Fide* is not the original
tract so entitled, but a letter on the same subject written, if not
during the episcopate, at least in the presbyterate.  This view has been
supported by the statement “Thus we believe and baptize.” <span
id="fr_531"></span>[532](#fn_531.md)

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p10"></span>This, however, might be said generally of
the custom obtaining in the Church, without reference to the writer’s
own practice.  Certainly the document appears to have no connexion with
those among which it stands, and to be an answer to some particular
request for a convenient summary couched in scriptural terms. <span
id="fr_532"></span>[533](#fn_532.md)   Hence it does not contain the
Homoousion, and the author gives his reason for the omission—an omission
which, he points out, is in contrast with his other writings against
heretics. <span id="fr_533"></span>[534](#fn_533.md)   Obviously,
therefore, this composition is to be placed in his later life.  Yet he
describes the *De Fide*as being anterior to the *Moralia*.

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p13"></span>It will be remembered that this objection
to the title and date of the extant *De Fide* implies nothing against
its being the genuine work of the archbishop.

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p14"></span>While carefully confining himself to the
language of Scripture, the author points out that even with this aid,
Faith, which he defines as an impartial assent to what has been revealed
to us by the gift of God, <span id="fr_534"></span>[535](#fn_534.md) must
necessarily be dark and incomplete.  God can only be clearly known in
heaven, when we shall see Him face to face. <span
id="fr_535"></span>[536](#fn_535.md)   The statement that has been
requested is as follows:

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p17"></span>“We believe and confess one true and good
God, Father Almighty, of Whom are all things, the God and Father of our
Lord Jesus Christ:  and His one Only-begotten Son, our Lord and God,
Jesus Christ, only true, through Whom all things were made, both visible
and invisible, and by Whom all things consist:  Who was in the beginning
with God and was God, and, after this, according to the Scriptures, was
seen on earth and had His conversation with men:  Who being in the form
of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but emptied Himself,
and by means of the birth from a virgin took a servant’s form, and was
formed in fashion as a man, and fulfilled all things written with
reference to Him and about Him, according to His Father’s commandment,
and became obedient unto death, even the death of the Cross.  And on the
third day He rose from the dead, according to the Scriptures, and was
seen by His holy disciples, and the rest, as it is written:  And He
ascended into heaven, and sitteth on the right hand of His Father,
whence He is coming at the end of this world, to raise all men, and to
give to every man according to his conduct.  Then the just shall be
taken up into life eternal and the kingdom of heaven, but the sinner
shall be condemned to eternal punishment, where their worm dieth not and
the fire is not quenched:  And in one Holy Ghost, the Comforter, in Whom
we were sealed to the day of redemption:  The Spirit of truth, the
Spirit of adoption, in Whom we cry, Abba, Father; Who divideth and
worketh the gifts that come of God, to each one for our good, as He
will; Who teaches and calls to remembrance all things that He has heard
from the Son; Who is good; Who guides us into all truth, and confirms
all that believe, both in sure knowledge and accurate confession, and in
pious service and spiritual and true worship of God the Father, and of
His only begotten Son our Lord, and of Himself.” <span
id="fr_536"></span>[537](#fn_536.md)

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p19"></span>(iii)  The *Moralia* (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.ii.iv-p19.1"></span>τὰ ἠθικά</span>) is
placed in 361, in the earlier days of the Anomœan heresy.  Shortly
before this time the extreme Arians began to receive this name, <span
id="fr_537"></span>[538](#fn_537.md) and it is on the rise of the Anomœans
that Basil is moved to write.  The work comprises eighty Rules of Life,
expressed in the words of the New Testament, with special reference to
the needs of bishops, priests, and deacons, and of all persons occupied
in education.

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p21"></span>Penitence consists not only in ceasing to
sin, but in expiating sin by tears and mortification. <span
id="fr_538"></span>[539](#fn_538.md)   Sins of ignorance are not free from
peril of judgment. <span id="fr_539"></span>[540](#fn_539.md)

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p24"></span>Sins into which we feel ourselves drawn
against our will are the results of sins to which we have
consented. <span id="fr_540"></span>[541](#fn_540.md)   Blasphemy against
the Holy Ghost consists in attributing <span id="page_lii">p. lii</span>
<span id="vi.ii.iv-Page_lii"></span>to the devil the good works which
the Spirit of God works in our brethren. <span
id="fr_541"></span>[542](#fn_541.md)   We ought carefully to examine
whether the doctrine offered us is conformable to Scripture, and if not,
to reject it. <span id="fr_542"></span>[543](#fn_542.md)   Nothing must be
added to the inspired words of God; all that is outside Scripture is not
of faith, but is sin. <span id="fr_543"></span>[544](#fn_543.md)

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p29"></span>(iv)  The *Regulæ fusius tractatæ* (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.ii.iv-p29.1"></span>ὅ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.ii.iv-p29.2"></span>ροι κατὰ πλάτος</span>),
55 in number, and the *Regulæ brevius tractatæ* (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.ii.iv-p29.3"></span>ὅ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.ii.iv-p29.4"></span>ροι κατ᾽
ἐπιτομήν</span>), in number 313, are a series of precepts for the
guidance of religious life put in the form of question and answer.  The
former are invariably supported by scriptural authority.

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p30"></span>Their genuineness is confirmed by strong
external evidence. <span id="fr_544"></span>[545](#fn_544.md)   Gregory of
Nazianzus (*Or*. xliii. § 34) speaks of Basil’s composing rules for
monastic life, and in *Ep*. vi. intimates that he helped his friend in
their composition. <span id="fr_545"></span>[546](#fn_545.md)   Rufinus
(*H.E.* ii. 9) mentions Basil’s *Instituta Monachorum*.  St. Jerome (*De
Vir. illust.* cxvi.) says that Basil wrote <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ii.iv-p32.1"></span>τὸ ἅ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ii.iv-p32.2"></span>σκητικόν</span>, and Photius (*Cod*. 191)
describes the *<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ii.iv-p32.3"></span>Ασχετιχυμ</span>* as including the *Regulæ*. 
Sozomen (*H.E*. iii. 14) remarks that the *Regulæ* were sometimes
attributed to Eustathius of Sebaste, but speaks of them as generally
recognised as St. Basil’s.

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p33"></span>The monk who relinquishes his status
after solemn profession and adoption is to be regarded as guilty of
sacrilege, and the faithful are warned against all intercourse with him,
with a reference to [2 Thess. iii.
14](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#014.md)<span
id="vi.ii.iv-p33.1"></span>. <span id="fr_546"></span>[547](#fn_546.md)

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p36"></span>Children are not to be received from
their parents except with full security for publicity in their
reception.  They are to be carefully instructed in the Scriptures.  They
are not to be allowed to make any profession till they come to years of
discretion (XV.).  Temperance is a virtue, but the servants of God are
not to condemn any of God’s creatures as unclean, and are to eat what is
given them.  (XVIII.)  Hospitality is to be exercised with the utmost
frugality and moderation, and the charge to Martha in [Luke x.
41](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#041.md)<span id="vi.ii.iv-p36.1"></span>,
is quoted with the reading <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ii.iv-p36.2"></span>ὀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ii.iv-p36.3"></span>λίγων δέ ἐστι χρεία ἢ ἑνός</span> <span
id="fr_547"></span>[548](#fn_547.md) and the interpretation “few,” namely
for provision, and “one,” namely the object in view,—enough for
necessity.  It would be as absurd for monks to change the simplicity of
their fare on the arrival of a distinguished guest as it would be for
them to change their dress (XX.).  Rule XXI. is against unevangelical
contention for places at table, and Rule XXII. regulates the monastic
habit.  The primary object of dress is said to be shewn by the words of
Genesis, <span id="fr_548"></span>[549](#fn_548.md) where God is said to
have made Adam and Eve “coats of skins,” or, as in the LXX., <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.ii.iv-p38.2"></span>χιτῶνας
δερματίνους</span>, *i.e.* tunics of hides.  This use of tunics was
enough for covering what was unseemly.  But later another object was
added—that of securing warmth by clothing.  So we must keep both ends in
view—decency, and protection against the weather.  Among articles of
dress some are very serviceable; some are less so.  It is better to
select what is most useful, so as to observe the rule of poverty, and
<span id="page_liii">p. liii</span> <span
id="vi.ii.iv-Page_liii"></span>to avoid a variety of vestments, some for
show, others for use; some for day, some for night.  A single garment
must be devised to serve for all purposes, and for night as well as
day.  As the soldier is known by his uniform, and the senator by his
robe, so the Christian ought to have his own dress.  Shoes are to be
provided on the same principle, they are to be simple and cheap.  The
girdle (XXIII.) is regarded as a necessary article of dress, not only
because of its practical utility, but because of the example of the Lord
Who girded Himself.  In Rule XXVI. all secrets are ordered to be
confided to the superintendent or bishop. <span
id="fr_549"></span>[550](#fn_549.md)   If the superintendent himself is in
error (XXVII.) he is to be corrected by other brothers.  Vicious
brethren (XXVIII.) are to be cut off like rotten limbs.  Self-exaltation
and discontent are equally to be avoided (XXIX.).  XXXVII. orders that
devotional exercise is to be no excuse for idleness and shirking work. 
Work is to be done not only as a chastisement of the body, but for the
sake of love to our neighbour and supplying weak and sick brethren with
the necessaries of life.  The apostle <span
id="fr_550"></span>[551](#fn_550.md) says that if a man will not work he
must not eat.  Daily work is as necessary as daily bread.  The services
of the day are thus marked out.  The first movements of heart and mind
ought to be consecrated to God.  Therefore early in the morning nothing
ought to be planned or purposed before we have been gladdened by the
thought of God; as it is written, “I remembered God, and was
gladdened;” <span id="fr_551"></span>[552](#fn_551.md) the body is not to
be set to work before we have obeyed the command, “O Lord, in the
morning shalt thou hear my voice; in the morning will I order my prayer
unto thee.” <span id="fr_552"></span>[553](#fn_552.md)   Again at the third
hour there is to be a rising up to prayer, and the brotherhood is to be
called together, even though they happen to have been dispersed to
various works.  The sixth hour is also to be marked by prayer, in
obedience to the words of the Psalmist, <span
id="fr_553"></span>[554](#fn_553.md) “evening, and morning, and at noon
will I pray, and cry aloud:  and He shall hear my voice.”  To ensure
deliverance from the demon of noon-day, <span
id="fr_554"></span>[555](#fn_554.md) the XCIst Psalm is to be recited.  The
ninth hour is consecrated to prayer by the example of the Apostles <span
id="fr_555"></span>[556](#fn_555.md) Peter and John, who at that hour went
up into the Temple to pray.  Now the day is done.  For all the boons of
the day, and the good deeds of the day, we must give thanks.  For
omissions there must be confession.  For sins voluntary or involuntary,
or unknown, we must appease God in prayer. <span
id="fr_556"></span>[557](#fn_556.md)   At nightfall the XCIst Psalm is to
be recited again, midnight is to be observed in obedience to the example
of Paul and Silas, <span id="fr_557"></span>[558](#fn_557.md) and the
injunction of the Psalmist. <span id="fr_558"></span>[559](#fn_558.md)  
Before dawn we should rise and pray again, as it is written, “Mine eyes
prevent the night watches.” <span id="fr_559"></span>[560](#fn_559.md)  
Here the canonical hours are marked, but no details are given as to the
forms of prayer.

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p50"></span>XL. deals with the abuse of holy places
and solemn assemblies.  Christians ought not to appear in places sacred
to martyrs or in their neighbourhood for any other reason than to pray
and commemorate the sacred dead.  Anything like a worldly festival or
common-mart at such times is like the sacrilege of the money changers in
the Temple precincts. <span id="fr_560"></span>[561](#fn_560.md)

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p52"></span>LI. gives directions for monastic
discipline.  “Let the superintendent exert discipline after the manner
of a physician treating his patients.  He is not angry with the sick,
but fights with the disease, and sets himself to combat their bad
symptoms.  If need be, he must heal the sickness of the soul by severer
treatment; for example, love of vain glory by the imposition of lowly
tasks; foolish talking, by silence; immoderate sleep, by watching and
prayer; idleness, by toil; gluttony, by fasting; murmuring, by
seclusion, so that no brothers may work with the offender, nor admit him
to participation in their works, till by his penitence that needeth not
to be ashamed he appear to be rid of his complaint.”

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p53"></span>LV. expounds at some length the doctrine
of original sin, to which disease and death are traced.

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p54"></span>The 313 *Regulæ brevius tractatæ* are,
like the *Regulæ fusius tractatæ*, in the form of questions and
answers.  Fessler singles out as a striking specimen XXXIV.

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p55"></span>Q.  “How is any one to avoid the sin of
man-pleasing, and looking to the praises of men?”

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p56"></span>A.  “There must be a full conviction of
the presence of God, an earnest intention to <span id="page_liv">p.
liv</span> <span id="vi.ii.iv-Page_liv"></span>please Him, and a burning
desire for the blessings promised by the Lord.  No one before his
Master’s very eyes is excited into dishonouring his Master and bringing
condemnation on himself, to please a fellow servant.”

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p57"></span>XLVII. points out that it is a grave
error to be silent when a brother sins.

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p58"></span>XLIX. tells us that vain gloriousness
(<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.ii.iv-p58.1"></span>τὸ
περπερεύεσθαι</span>.  Cf. [1 Cor. xiii.
4](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#004)<span id="vi.ii.iv-p58.2"></span>.md)
consists in taking things not for use, but for ostentation; and L.
illustrates this principle in the case of dress.

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p59"></span>Q.  “When a man has abandoned all more
expensive clothing, does he sin, and, if so, how, if he wishes his cheap
upper garment or shoes to be becoming to him?”

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p60"></span>A.  “If he so wishes in order to gratify
men, he is obviously guilty of the sin of man-pleasing.  He is alienated
from God, and is guilty of vain glory even in these cheap belongings.”

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p61"></span>LXIV. is a somewhat lengthy comment on
[Matt. xvii. 6](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#006.md)<span
id="vi.ii.iv-p61.1"></span>.  To “make to offend,” or “to scandalize,”
is to induce another to break the law, as the serpent Eve, and Eve Adam.

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p62"></span>LXXXIII. is pithy.

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p63"></span>Q.  “If a man is generally in the right,
and falls into one sin, how are we to treat him?

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p64"></span>A.  “As the Lord treated Peter.”

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p65"></span>CXXVIII. is on fasting.

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p66"></span>Q.  “Ought any one to be allowed to
exercise abstinence beyond his strength, so that he is hindered in the
performance of his duty?”

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p67"></span>A.  “This question does not seem to me to
be properly worded.  Temperance <span id="fr_561"></span>[562](#fn_561.md)
does not consist in abstinence from earthly food, <span
id="fr_562"></span>[563](#fn_562.md) wherein lies the ‘neglecting of the
body’ <span id="fr_563"></span>[564](#fn_563.md) condemned by the Apostles,
but in complete departure from one’s own wishes.  And how great is the
danger of our falling away from the Lord’s commandment on account of our
own wishes is clear from the words of the Apostle, ‘fulfilling the
desires of the flesh, and of the mind, and were by nature the children
of wrath.’” <span id="fr_564"></span>[565](#fn_564.md)   The numbers in the
Cœnobium are not to fall below ten, the number of the eaters of the
Paschal supper. <span id="fr_565"></span>[566](#fn_565.md)   Nothing is to
be considered individual and personal property. <span
id="fr_566"></span>[567](#fn_566.md)   Even a man’s thoughts are not his
own. <span id="fr_567"></span>[568](#fn_567.md)   Private friendships are
harmful to the general interests of the community. <span
id="fr_568"></span>[569](#fn_568.md)   At meals there is to be a reading,
which is to be thought more of than mere material food. <span
id="fr_569"></span>[570](#fn_569.md)   The cultivation of the ground is the
most suitable occupation for the ascetic life. <span
id="fr_570"></span>[571](#fn_570.md)   No fees are to be taken for the
charge of children entrusted to the monks. <span
id="fr_571"></span>[572](#fn_571.md)   Such children are not to be pledged
to join the community till they are old enough to understand what they
are about. <span id="fr_572"></span>[573](#fn_572.md)

by C. F. Matthæi at Moscow in 1775, entitled *Joannis Xiphilini et
Basilii M. aliquot orationes*.  He describes it as quite unworthy in

id="vi.ii.iv-p33.2"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p34"></span> With this may be compared the
uncompromising denunciation in *Letter* cclxxxviii., and what is said in
the first of the three *Tractatus Prævii*.  It has been represented that
St. Basil introduced the practice of irrevocable vows.  *cf*. Dr.
Travers Smith, *St. Basil*, p. 223.  De Broglie, *L’Eglise et l’empire*,
v. 180:  “*Avant lui, c’était, aux yeux de beaucoup de ceux même qui s’y
destinaient, une vocation libre, affaire de goût et de zèle, pouvant
être dilaissée à volonté, comme elle avait été embrassée par chois.  Le
sceau de la perpetiuté obligatoire, ce fut Basile qui l’imprima; c’est à
lui réellement que remonte, comme règlé commune, et comme habitude
générale, l’institution des vœux perpétuels*.  Helyot, *Hist. des ordres
monastiques*, i. § 3, Bultean, *Hist. des moines d’orient*, p. 402,
Montalembert, *Hist. des moines d’occident*, i. 105, *s’accordent à
reconnaitre que l’usage général des vœux perpétuels remonte à St.
Basil*.”  To St. Basil’s posthumous influence the system may be due. 
But it seems questionable whether St. Basil’s Rule included formal vows
of perpetual obligation in the more modern sense.  I am not quite sure
that the passages cited fully bear this out.  Is the earnest exhortation
not to quit the holier life consistent with a binding pledge?  Would not
a more distinctly authoritative tone be adopted?  *cf*. *Letters* xlv.
and xlvi.  It is plain that a reminder was needed, and that the plea was
possible that the profession had not the binding force of matrimony. 
The line taken is rather that a monk or nun *ought* to remain in his or
her profession, and that it is a grievous sin to abandon it, than that
there is an irrevocable contract.  So in the *Sermo asceticus* (it is
not universally accepted), printed by Garnier between the *Moralia* and
the *Regulæ*, it is said:  “Before the profession of the religious life,
any one is at liberty to get the good of this life, in accordance with
law and custom, and to give himself to the yoke of wedlock.  But when he
has been enlisted, of his own consent, it is fitting (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.ii.iv-p34.1"></span>προσήκει</span>) that he
keep himself for God, as one of the sacred offerings, so that he may not
risk incurring the damnation of sacrilege, by defiling in the service of
this world the body consecrated by promise to God.”  This <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.ii.iv-p34.2"></span>προσήκει</span> is
repeated in the *Regulæ*.  Basil’s monk, says Fialon (*Et. Hist*., p.
49) was irrevocably bound by the laws of the Church, by public opinion,
and, still more, by his conscience.  It is to the last that the founder
of the organisation seems to appeal.  In *Letter* xlvi. the reproach is
not addressed merely to a “*religieuse échappé de son cloitre*,” as De
Broglie has it, but to a nun guilty of unchastity.  Vows of virginity
were among the earliest of religious obligations.  (*cf*. J. Martyr,
*Apol*. i. 15, Athenvaras, *Legat*. 32, Origen, *C. Celsum*. vii. 48.)

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p35"></span>Basil (Can. xviii.) punishes a breach of
the vow of virginity as he does adultery, but it was not till the
Benedictine rule was established in Europe that it was generally
regarded as absolutely irrevocable.  (*cf. D.C.A. s.v*. “Nun,” ii. p.
1411, and H. C. Lea’s *History of Celibacy*, Philadelphia, 1867.)  As a
matter of fact, Basil’s cœnobitic monasticism, in comparison with the
“wilder and more dreamy asceticism which prevailed in Egypt and Syria”
(Milman, *Hist. Christ*. iii. 109), was “far more moderate and
practical.”  It was a community of self-denying practical beneficence. 
Work and worship were to aid one another.  This was the highest life,
and to quit it was desertion of and disloyalty to neighbour and God.  To
Basil, is it not rather the violation of holiness than the technical
breach of a formal vow which is sacrilege?  Lea (p. 101) quotes
Epiphanius (*Panar*. 61) as saying that it was better for a lapsed monk
to take a lawful wife and be reconciled to the church through Penance. 
Basil in Can. lx. (p. 256) contemplates a similar reconciliation.

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p79"></span> *Reg. fus. tract*. xv.  After the
*Regulæ* are printed, in Garnier’s Ed. 34, *Constitutiones Monasticæ*,
with the note that their genuineness is more suspicious than that of any
of the ascetic writings.  They treat of the details of monastic life, of
the virtues to be cultivated in it and the vices to be avoided.  Sozomen
(*H.E*. iii. 14) has been supposed to refer to them.  All later
criticism has been unfavourable to them.  *cf*. Maran, *Vit. Bas*.
xliii. 7; Ceillier VI. viii. 3; Fessler, p. 524.  It may be remarked
generally that the asceticism of St. Basil is eminently practical.  He
has no notion of mortification for mortification’s sake,—no praise for
the self-advertising and vain-glorious rigour of the Stylites. 
Neglecting the body, or “not sparing the body” by exaggerated
mortification, in is cclviii. condemned as Manichæism.  It is of course
always an objection to exclusive exaltation of the ascetic life that it
is a kind of moral docetism, and ignores the fact that Christianity has
not repudiated all concern with the body, but is designed to elevate and
to purify it.  (*cf*. Böhringer vii. p. 150.)  Basil may be not unjustly
criticised from this point of view, and accused of the very Manichæism
which he distinctly condemns.  But it will be remembered that he
recognises the holiness of marriage and family life, and if he thinks
virginity and cœnobitism a higher life, has no mercy for the dilettante
asceticism of a morbid or indolent “*incivisme*.”  Valens, from the
point of view of a master of legions, might deplore monastic celibacy,
and press Egyptian monks by thousands into the ranks of his army. 
(*cf*. Milman, *Hist. Christ*. iii. 47.)  Basil from his point of view
was equally positive that he was making useful citizens, and that his
industrious associates, of clean and frugal lives, were doing good
service.

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p80"></span>“*En effet, le moine basilien, n’est pas,
comme le cénobite d’Égypte, séparé du monde par un mur infranchissable 
‘Les poissons meurent,’ disait Saint Antoine, ‘quand on les tire de
l’eau, et les moines s’énervent dans les villes; rentrons vîte dans les
montagnes, comme les poissons dans l‘eau*.’  (Montalembert, *Moines
d’Occident*, i. 61.)  *Les moines basiliens vivent aussi dans la
solitude pour gagner le ciel, mais ils ne veulent pas le gagner
seuls.…Les principaux, au moins, doivent se mêler à la société pour
l’instruire.  Cet homme à la chevelure négligée, à la demarche posie,
dont l’œil nes s’égare jamais, ouvre son monastère à ses sembables, ou
va les trouver, du moment qu’il s’agit de leur edification.  Son contact
fortifie le clergé; il entre lui-même dans les ordres, et devient
collaborateur de l’évêque.  Il va aux fètes des martyrs et prêche dans
les églises.  Il entre dans les maisons, prend part aux conversations,
aux repas, et, tout en evitant les longs entretiens et les liaisons aux
les femmes, et le directeur et le compagnon de piété des âmes.…Le moine
ne doit pas seulement soulager les mœux de l’âme.  Les maisons des
pauvres, dont se couvrait une parlie de l’Asie Mineure, étatent des
asiles ouverts toutes les souffrances physiques.…Pour Basile, ces deux
institutions, le monastère et la maisons des pauvres, quoique séparées
et distinctes, n’en formaient qu’une.  A ses yeux, les secours corporels
n’etaient qu’un moyen d’arriver à l’âme.  Pendant que la main du moine
servait les voyageurs, nourissait les pauvres, pausait les malades, ses
lèvres leur distribuatent une aumône plus précieuse, celle de la parole
de Dieu*.”  Fialon, *Ét Historique*, pp. 51–53.  A high ideal!  Perhaps
never more nearly realized than in the Cappadocian cœnobia of the fourth
century.
