<span id="vii.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vii.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter III.</span>

<span id="vii.iv-p2"></span>The systematic discussion of syllables is
derived from heathen philosophy.

<span id="vii.iv-p3"></span>5.  <span class="c14"><span
id="vii.iv-p3.1"></span>They</span> have, however, been led into this
error by their close study of heathen writers, who have respectively
applied the terms “*of* whom” and “*through* whom” to things which are
by nature distinct.  These writers suppose that by the term “*of* whom”
or “*of* which” the matter is indicated, while the term “*through* whom”
or “*through* which” <span id="fr_718"></span>[719](#fn_718) represents
the instrument, or, generally speaking, subordinate agency. <span
id="fr_719"></span>[720](#fn_719)   Or rather—for there seems no reason
why we should not take up their whole argument, and briefly expose at
once its incompatibility with the truth and its inconsistency with their
own teaching—the students of vain philosophy, while expounding the
manifold nature of cause and distinguishing its peculiar significations,
define some causes as principal, <span id="fr_720"></span>[721](#fn_720)
some as cooperative or con-causal, while others are of the character of
“*sine qua non*,” or indispensable. <span
id="fr_721"></span>[722](#fn_721)

<span id="vii.iv-p25"></span>For every one of these they have a distinct
and peculiar use of terms, so that the maker is indicated in a different
way from the instrument.  For the maker they think the proper expression
is “*by* whom,” maintaining that the bench is produced “*by*” the
carpenter; and for the instrument “through which,” in that it is
produced “through” or by means of adze and gimlet and the rest. 
Similarly they appropriate “*of* which” to the material, in that the
thing made is “of” wood, while “according to which” shews the design, or
pattern put before the craftsman.  For he either first makes a mental
sketch, and so brings his fancy to bear upon what he is about, or else
he looks at a pattern previously put before him, and arranges his work
accordingly.  The phrase “*on account of* which” they wish to be
confined to the end or purpose, the bench, as they say, being produced
for, or on account of, the use of man.  “*In* which” is supposed to
indicate time and place.  When was it produced?  In this time.  And
where?  In this place.  And though place and time contribute nothing to
what is being produced, yet without these the production of anything is
impossible, for efficient agents must have both place and time.  It is
these careful distinctions, derived from unpractical philosophy and vain
delusion, <span id="fr_722"></span>[723](#fn_722) which our opponents
have first studied and admired, and then transferred to the simple and
unsophisticated doctrine of the Spirit, to the belittling of God the
Word, and the setting at naught of the Divine Spirit.  Even the phrase
set apart by non-Christian writers for the case of lifeless
instruments <span id="fr_723"></span>[724](#fn_723) or of manual <span
id="page_5">p. 5</span> <span id="vii.iv-Page_5"></span>service of the
meanest kind, I mean the expression “*through* or *by means of* which,”
they do not shrink from transferring to the Lord of all, and Christians
feel no shame in applying to the Creator of the universe language
belonging to a hammer or a saw.

<span id="vii.iv-p4"></span> The ambiguity of gender in <span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.iv-p4.1"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.iv-p4.2"></span>ξ οὗ</span> and <span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.iv-p4.3"></span>δι᾽ οὗ</span> can only be
expressed by giving the alternatives in English.

<span id="fn_719"></span>[4:720](2080033.htm#fr_719) <span
id="vii.iv-p4.4"></span>

<span id="vii.iv-p5"></span> There are four causes or varieties of
cause:

<span id="vii.iv-p6"></span>1.  The essence or quiddity (Form):  <span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.iv-p6.1"></span>τὸ τί ἦν εἶναι</span>.

<span id="vii.iv-p7"></span>2.  The necessitating conditions (Matter): 
<span class="Greek"><span id="vii.iv-p7.1"></span>τὸ τίνων ὄντων ἀνάγκη
τοῦτ᾽ εἶναι</span>.

<span id="vii.iv-p8"></span>3.  The proximate mover or stimulator of
change (Efficient):  <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.iv-p8.1"></span>ἡ</span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.iv-p8.2"></span>τί πρῶτον ἐκίνησε</span>.

<span id="vii.iv-p9"></span>4.  That for the sake of which (Final Cause
or End):  <span class="Greek"><span id="vii.iv-p9.1"></span>τὸ τίνος
ἕνεκα</span>.  Grote’s *Aristotle*, I. 354.

<span id="vii.iv-p10"></span>The four Aristotelian causes are thus:  1.
Formal.  2. Material.  3. Efficient.  4. Final.  *cf*. Arist. Analyt.
Post. II. xi., Metaph. I. iii., and Phys. II. iii.  The six causes of
Basil may be referred to the four of Aristotle as follows:

<span id="vii.iv-p11"></span>Aristotle.

<span id="vii.iv-p23"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.iv-p23.1"></span>προκαταρκτική</span>.  *cf*. Plut. 2, 1056.
B.D. <span class="Greek"><span id="vii.iv-p23.2"></span>προκαταρκτικὴ
αἰτία ἡ εἱμαρμένη</span>.

<span id="fn_721"></span>[4:722](2080033.htm#fr_721) <span
id="vii.iv-p23.3"></span>

<span id="vii.iv-p24"></span> *cf*. Clem. Alex. Strom. viii. 9.  “Of
causes some are principal, some preservative, some coöperative, some
indispensable; *e.g*. of education the principal cause is the father;
the preservative, the schoolmaster; the coöperative, the disposition of
the pupil; the indispensable, time.”

id="vii.iv-p26.2"></span>κ τῆς ματαιότητος καὶ κενῆς ἀπάτης</span>.

<span id="vii.iv-p27"></span>*cf*. <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.iv-p27.1"></span>ματαιότης ματαιοτήτων</span>, “vanity of
vanities,” [Ecc. i. 2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#002)<span
id="vii.iv-p27.2"></span>, lxx.  In Arist. Eth. i. 2, a desire is said
to be <span class="Greek"><span id="vii.iv-p27.3"></span>κενὴ καὶ
ματαία</span>, which goes into infinity,—everything being desired for
the sake of something else,—*i.e*., <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.iv-p27.4"></span>κενη</span>, void, like a desire for the moon,
and <span class="Greek"><span id="vii.iv-p27.5"></span>ματαία</span>,
unpractical, like a desire for the empire of China.  In the text <span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.iv-p27.6"></span>ματαιότης</span> seems to
mean heathen philosophy, a vain delusion as distinguished from Christian
philosophy.
