<span id="ix.ccxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.ccxvii-p1.1"></span>Letter CCXVI. <span
id="fr_2822"></span>[2823](#fn_2822.md) </span>

<span id="ix.ccxvii-p3"></span>To Meletius, bishop of Antioch.

<span id="ix.ccxvii-p4"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.ccxvii-p4.1"></span>Many</span> other <span
id="fr_2823"></span>[2824](#fn_2823.md) journeys have taken me from home. 
I have been as far as Pisidia to settle the matters concerning the
brethren in Isauria in concert with the Pisidian bishops.  Thence I
journeyed into Pontus, for Eustathius had caused no small disturbance at
Dazimon, and had caused there a considerable secession from our church. 
I even went as far as the home of my brother Peter, <span
id="fr_2824"></span>[2825](#fn_2824.md) and, as this is not far from
Neocæsarea, there was occasion of considerable trouble to the
Neocæsareans, and of much rudeness to myself.  Some men fled when no one
was in pursuit.  And I was supposed to be intruding uninvited, simply to
get compliments from the folk there.  As soon as I got home, after
contracting a severe illness from the bad weather and my anxieties, I
straightway received a letter from the East to tell me that Paulinus had
had certain letters from the West addressed to him, in acknowledgement
of a sort of higher claim; and that the Antiochene rebels were vastly
elated by them, and were next preparing a form of creed, and offering to
make its terms a condition of union with our Church.  Besides all this
it was reported to me that they had seduced to their faction that most
excellent man Terentius.  I wrote to him at once as forcibly as I could,
to induce him to pause; and I tried to point out their disingenuousness.

<span id="ix.ccxvii-p5"></span> On this word *other* the Ben. note
grounds the argument that Meletius had proposed a journey which Basil
had not undertaken, and hence that the unnamed bishop of *Letter*
ccxiii. is Meletius; and further that the fact of the bishop not being
named in ccxiii., and the obscurity of this and of other letters, may
indicate the writer’s hesitation to put particulars in his letters which
might be more discreetly left to be conveyed by word of mouth.

Peter had succeeded Basil as Head.
