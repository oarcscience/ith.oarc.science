<span id="ix.lxxxi-p3"></span>*To Athanasius, bishop of Alexandria*.

<span id="ix.lxxxi-p4"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.lxxxi-p4.1"></span>The</span> worse the diseases of the Churches
grow, the more do we all turn to your excellency, in the belief that
your championship is the one consolation left to us in our troubles.  By
the power of your prayers, and your knowledge of what is the best course
to suggest in the emergency, you are believed to be able to save us from
this terrible tempest by all alike who know your excellency even to a
small extent, whether by hearsay or by personal experience.  Wherefore,
cease not, I implore, to pray for our souls and to rouse us by your
letters.  Did you but know of what service these are <span
id="page_172">p. 172</span> <span id="ix.lxxxi-Page_172"></span>to us
you would never have lost a single opportunity of writing.  Could I
only, by the aid of your prayers, be deemed worthy of seeing you, and of
enjoying your good qualities, and of adding to the story of my life a
meeting with your truly great and apostolical soul, then I should indeed
believe that I had received from God’s mercy a consolation equivalent to
all the afflictions of my life.
