id="ix.ccxxxv-p1.1"></span>Letter CCXXXIV. <span
id="fr_2954"></span>[2955](#fn_2954.md) </span>

<span id="ix.ccxxxv-p3"></span>To the same, in answer to another
question.

<span id="ix.ccxxxv-p4"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.ccxxxv-p4.1"></span>Do</span> you worship what you know or what
you do not know?  If I answer, I worship what I know, they immediately
reply, What is the essence of the object of worship?  Then, if I confess
that I am ignorant of the essence, they turn on me again and say, So you
worship you know not what.  I answer that the word to know has many
meanings.  We say that we know the greatness of God, His power, His
wisdom, His goodness, His providence over us, and the justness of His
judgment; but not His very essence.  The question is, therefore, only
put for the sake of dispute.  For he who denies that he knows the
essence does not confess himself to be ignorant of God, because our idea
of God is gathered from all the attributes which I have enumerated.  But
God, he says, is simple, and whatever attribute of Him you have reckoned
as knowable is of His essence.  But the absurdities involved in this
sophism are innumerable.  When all these high attributes have been
enumerated, are they all names of one essence?  And is there the same
mutual force in His awfulness and His loving-kindness, His justice and
His creative power, His providence and His foreknowledge, and His
bestowal of rewards and punishments, His majesty and His providence?  In
mentioning any one of these do we declare His essence?  If they say,
yes, let them not ask if we know the essence of God, but let them
enquire of us whether we know God to be awful, or just, or merciful. 
These we confess that we know.  If they say that essence is something
distinct, let them not put us in the wrong on the score of simplicity. 
For they confess themselves that there is a distinction between the
essence and each one of the attributes enumerated.  The operations are
various, and the essence simple, but we say that we know our God from
His operations, but do not undertake to approach near to His essence. 
His operations come down to us, but His essence remains beyond our
reach.

<span id="ix.ccxxxv-p5"></span>2.  But, it is replied, if you are
ignorant of the essence, you are ignorant of Himself.  Retort, If you
say that you know His essence, you are ignorant of Himself.  A man who
has been bitten by a mad dog, and sees a dog in a dish, does not really
see any more than is seen by people in good health; he is to be pitied
because he thinks he sees what he does not see.  Do not then admire him
for his announcement, but pity him for his insanity.  Recognise that the
voice is the voice of mockers, when they say, if you are ignorant of the
essence of God, you worship what you do not know.  I do know that He
exists; what His essence is, I look at as beyond intelligence.  How then
am I saved?  Through faith.  It is faith sufficient to know that God
exists, without knowing what He is; and “He is a rewarder of them that
seek Him.” <span id="fr_2955"></span>[2956](#fn_2955.md)   So knowledge of
the divine essence involves perception of His incomprehensibility, and
the object of our worship is not that of which we comprehend the
essence, but of which we comprehend that the essence exists.

<span id="ix.ccxxxv-p7"></span>3.  And the following counter question
may also be put to them.  “No man hath seen God at any time, the
Only-begotten which is in the bosom hath declared him.” <span
id="fr_2956"></span>[2957](#fn_2956.md)   What of the Father did the
Only-begotten Son declare?  His essence or His power?  If His power, we
know so much as He declared to us.  If His essence, tell me where He
said that His essence was the being unbegotten? <span
id="fr_2957"></span>[2958](#fn_2957.md)   When did Abraham worship?  Was it
not when he believed?  And when did he believe?  Was it not when he was
called?  Where in this place is there any testimony in Scripture to
Abraham’s comprehending?  When did the disciples worship Him?  Was it
not when they saw creation subject to Him?  It was from the obedience of
sea and winds to Him that they recognised His Godhead.  Therefore the
knowledge came from the operations, and the worship from the knowledge. 
“Believest thou that I am able to do this?”  “I believe, Lord;” <span
id="fr_2958"></span>[2959](#fn_2958.md) and he worshipped Him.  So worship
follows faith, and faith is confirmed by power.  But if you say that the
believer also knows, he knows from what he believes; and vice versa he
believes from what he knows.  We know God from His power.  We,
therefore, believe in Him who is known, and we worship Him who is
believed in.
