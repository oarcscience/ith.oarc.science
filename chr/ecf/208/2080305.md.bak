<span id="ix.ccxxxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.ccxxxiii-p1.1"></span>Letter CCXXXII. <span
id="fr_2946"></span>[2947](#fn_2946.md) </span>

<span id="ix.ccxxxiii-p3"></span>To Amphilochius, bishop of Iconium.

<span id="ix.ccxxxiii-p4"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.ccxxxiii-p4.1"></span>Every</span> day that brings me a letter
from you is a feast day, the very greatest of feast days.  And when
symbols of the feast are brought, what can I call it but a feast of
feasts, as the old law used to speak of Sabbath of Sabbaths?  I thank
the Lord that you are quite well, and that you have celebrated the
commemoration of the economy of salvation <span
id="fr_2947"></span>[2948](#fn_2947.md) in a Church at peace.  I have been
disturbed by some troubles; and have not been without distress from the
fact of my God-beloved brother being in exile.  Pray for him that God
may one day grant him to see his Church healed from the wounds of <span
id="page_273">p. 273</span> <span
id="ix.ccxxxiii-Page_273"></span>heretical bites.  Do come to see me
while I am yet upon this earth.  Act in accordance with your own wishes
and with my most earnest prayers.  I may be allowed to be astonished at
the meaning of your blessings, inasmuch as you have mysteriously wished
me a vigorous old age.  By your lamps <span
id="fr_2948"></span>[2949](#fn_2948.md) you rouse me to nightly toil; and
by your sweet meats you seem to pledge yourself securely that all my
body is in good case.  But there is no munching for me at my time of
life, for my teeth have long ago been worn away by time and bad health. 
As to what you have asked me there are some replies in the document I
send you, written to the best of my ability, and as opportunity has
allowed.

<span id="ix.ccxxxiii-p2"></span> Placed in 376.  Maran, *Vit. Bas*.
xxxv., thinks that this letter is to be placed either in the last days
of 375, if the Nativity was celebrated on December 25, or in the
beginning of 376, if it followed after the Epiphany.  The Oriental usage
up to the end of the fourth century, was to celebrate the Nativity and
Baptism on January 6.  St. Chrysostom, in the homily on the birthday of
our Saviour, delivered c. 386, speaks of the separation of the
celebration of the Nativity from that of the Epiphany as comparatively
recent.  *cf.* *D.C.A.*, 1, pp. 361, 617.

and 12, n.

<span id="ix.ccxxxiii-p6"></span> The reading of the Ben. ed. is <span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.ccxxxiii-p6.1"></span>λαμπηνῶν</span>.  The
only meaning of <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.ccxxxiii-p6.2"></span>λαμπήνη</span> in Class. Greek is a kind of
*covered carriage*, and the cognate adj. <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.ccxxxiii-p6.3"></span>λαμπήνικος</span> is used for the *covered*
waggons of [Numb. vii. 3](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#003.md)<span
id="ix.ccxxxiii-p6.4"></span> in the LXX.  But the context necessitates
some such meaning as *lamp* or candle.  Ducange *s.v.* quotes John de
Janua “*Lampenæ sunt stellæ fulgentes*.”  *cf*. Italian *<span
id="ix.ccxxxiii-p6.5"></span>Lampana,* *i.e*. lamp.
