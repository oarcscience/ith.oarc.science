<span id="vii.xxvi-p1"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="vii.xxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXV.</span>

<span id="vii.xxvi-p2"></span>*That Scripture uses the words “in” or
“by,”* *<span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xxvi-p2.1"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xxvi-p2.2"></span>ν</span>, cf. note on p. 3, in place of
“with.”  Wherein also it is proved that the word “and” has the same
force as “with.”*

<span id="vii.xxvi-p3"></span>58.  <span class="c14"><span
id="vii.xxvi-p3.1"></span>It</span> is, however, asked by our opponents,
how it is that Scripture nowhere describes the Spirit as glorified
together with the Father and the Son, but carefully avoids the use of
the expression “with the Spirit,” while it everywhere prefers to ascribe
glory “in Him” as being the fitter phrase.  I should, for my own part,
deny that the word in \[or by\] implies lower dignity than the word
“with;” I should maintain on the contrary that, rightly understood, it
leads us up to the highest possible meaning.  This is the case where, as
we have observed, it often stands instead of *with*; as for instance, “I
will go into thy house in burnt offerings,” <span
id="fr_1214"></span>[1215](#fn_1214.md) instead of *with* burnt offerings
and “he brought them forth also by silver and gold,” <span
id="fr_1215"></span>[1216](#fn_1215.md) that is to say *with* silver and
gold and “thou goest not forth *in* our armies” <span
id="fr_1216"></span>[1217](#fn_1216.md) instead of *with* our armies, and
innumerable similar passages.  In short I should very much like to learn
from this newfangled philosophy what kind of glory the Apostle ascribed
by the word *in*, according to the interpretation which our opponents
proffer as derived from Scripture, for I have nowhere found the formula
“To Thee, O Father, be honour and glory, through Thy only begotten Son,
*by* \[or *in*\] the Holy Ghost,”—a form which to our opponents comes,
so to say, as naturally as the air they breathe.  You may indeed find
each of these clauses <span id="page_37">p. 37</span> <span
id="vii.xxvi-Page_37"></span>separately, <span
id="fr_1217"></span>[1218](#fn_1217.md) but they will nowhere be able to
show them to us arranged in this conjunction.  If, then, they want exact
conformity to what is written, let them give us exact references.  If,
on the other hand, they make concession to custom, they must not make us
an exception to such a privilege.

<span id="vii.xxvi-p8"></span>59.  As we find both expressions in use
among the faithful, we use both; in the belief that full glory is
equally given to the Spirit by both.  The mouths, however, of revilers
of the truth may best be stopped by the preposition which, while it has
the same meaning as that of the Scriptures, is not so wieldy a weapon
for our opponents, (indeed it is now an object of their attack) and is
used instead of the conjunction *and*.  For to say “Paul and Silvanus
and Timothy” <span id="fr_1218"></span>[1219](#fn_1218.md) is precisely the
same thing as to say Paul *with* Timothy and Silvanus; for the connexion
of the names is preserved by either mode of expression.  The Lord says
“The Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost.” <span
id="fr_1219"></span>[1220](#fn_1219.md)   If I say the Father and the Son
*with* the Holy Ghost shall I make, any difference in the sense?  Of the
connexion of names by means of the conjunction *and* the instances are
many.  We read “The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God
and the fellowship of the Holy Ghost,” <span
id="fr_1220"></span>[1221](#fn_1220.md) and again “I beseech you for the
Lord Jesus Christ’s sake, and for the love of the Spirit.” <span
id="fr_1221"></span>[1222](#fn_1221.md)   Now if we wish to use *with*
instead of *and*, what difference shall we have made?  I do not see;
unless any one according to hard and fast grammatical rules might prefer
the conjunction as copulative and making the union stronger, and reject
the preposition as of inferior force.  But if we had to defend ourselves
on these points I do not suppose we should require a defence of many
words.  As it is, their argument is not about syllables nor yet about
this or that sound of a word, but about things differing most widely in
power and in truth.  It is for this reason that, while the use of the
syllables is really a matter of no importance whatever, our opponents
are making the endeavour to authorise some syllables, and hunt out
others from the Church.  For my own part, although the usefulness of the
word is obvious as soon as it is heard, I will nevertheless set forth
the arguments which led our fathers to adopt the reasonable course of
employing the preposition “*with*.” <span
id="fr_1222"></span>[1223](#fn_1222.md)   It does indeed equally well with
the preposition “and,” confute the mischief of Sabellius; <span
id="fr_1223"></span>[1224](#fn_1223.md) and it sets forth quite as well as
“*and*” the distinction of the hypostases, as in the words “I and my
Father will come,” <span id="fr_1224"></span>[1225](#fn_1224.md) and “I and
my Father are one.” <span id="fr_1225"></span>[1226](#fn_1225.md)   In
addition to this the proof it contains of the eternal fellowship and
uninterrupted conjunction is excellent.  For to say that the Son is
*with* the Father is to exhibit at once the distinction of the
hypostases, and the inseparability of the fellowship.  The same thing is
observable even in mere human matters, for the conjunction “*and*”
intimates that there is a common element in an action, while the
preposition “with” declares in some sense as well the communion in
action.  As, for instance;—Paul and Timothy sailed to Macedonia, but
both Tychicus and Onesimus were sent to the Colossians.  Hence we learn
that they did the same thing.  But suppose we are told that they sailed
*with*, and were sent *with*?  Then we are informed in addition that
they carried out the action in company with one another.  Thus while the
word “*with*” upsets the error of Sabellius as no other word can, it
routs also sinners who err in the very opposite direction; those, I
mean, who separate the Son from the Father and the Spirit from the Son,
by intervals of time. <span id="fr_1226"></span>[1227](#fn_1226.md)

<span id="vii.xxvi-p18"></span>60.  As compared with “*in*,” there is
this difference, that while “*with*” sets forth the mutual conjunction
of the parties associated,—as, for example, of those who sail with, or
dwell with, or do anything else in common, “*in*” shews their relation
to that matter in which they happen to be acting.  For we no sooner hear
the words “sail in” or “dwell in” than we form the idea of the boat or
the house.  Such is the distinction <span id="page_38">p. 38</span>
<span id="vii.xxvi-Page_38"></span>between these words in ordinary
usage; and laborious investigation might discover further
illustrations.  I have no time to examine into the nature of the
syllables.  Since then it has been shewn that “*with*” most clearly
gives the sense of conjunction, let it be declared, if you will, to be
under safe-conduct, and cease to wage your savage and truceless war
against it.  Nevertheless, though the word is naturally thus auspicious,
yet if any one likes, in the ascription of praise, to couple the names
by the syllable “and,” and to give glory, as we have taught in the
Gospel, in the formula of baptism, Father and Son and Holy Ghost, <span
id="fr_1227"></span>[1228](#fn_1227.md) be it so:  no one will make any
objection.  On these conditions, if you will, let us come to terms.  But
our foes would rather surrender their tongues than accept this word.  It
is this that rouses against us their implacable and truceless war.  We
must offer the ascription of glory to God, it is contended, *in* the
Holy Ghost, and not *and* to the Holy Ghost, and they passionately cling
to this word *in*, as though it lowered the Spirit.  It will therefore
be not unprofitable to speak at greater length about it; and I shall be
astonished if they do not, when they have heard what we have to urge,
reject the *in* as itself a traitor to their cause, and a deserter to
the side of the glory of the Spirit.

<span id="vii.xxvi-p14"></span> “Sabellius has been usually assigned to
the middle of third century, Mr. Clinton giving <span class="c14"><span
id="vii.xxvi-p14.1"></span>a.d.</span> 256–270 as his active period. 
The discovery of the *Philosophumena* of Hippolytus has proved this to
be a mistake, and thrown his period back to the close of the second and
beginning of the third century.…He was in full activity in Rome during
the Episcopate of Zephyrinus, <span class="c14"><span
id="vii.xxvi-p14.2"></span>a.d.</span> 198–217.”  Professor Stokes in
*D. C. Biog*. iv. 569.  For Basil’s views of Sabellianism *vide* Epp.
CCX., CCXIV., CCXXXV.  In his *Hær. Fab. Conf.* ii. 9 Theodoret writes: 
“Sabellius said that Father, Son, and Holy Ghost were one Hypostasis;
one Person under three names; and he describes the same now as Father,
now as Son, now as Holy Ghost.  He says that in the old Testament He
gave laws as Father, was incarnate in the new as Son, and visited the
Apostles as Holy Ghost.”  So in the <span class="Greek"><span

falsely attributed to Gregory Thaumaturgus, and possibly due to
Apollinaris, (*cf*. Theod., *Dial*. iii.) “We shun Sabellius, who says
that Father and Son are the same, calling Him who speaks Father, and the
Word, remaining in the Father and at the time of creation manifested,
and, on the completion of things returning to the Father, Son.  He says
the same of the Holy Ghost.”
