<span id="ix.ccxl-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.ccxl-p1.1"></span>Letter CCXXXIX. <span
id="fr_3014"></span>[3015](#fn_3014) </span>

<span id="ix.ccxl-p3"></span>To Eusebius, bishop of Samosata.

<span id="ix.ccxl-p4"></span>1.  <span class="c14"><span
id="ix.ccxl-p4.1"></span>The</span> Lord has granted me the privilege of
now saluting your holiness by our beloved and very reverend brother, the
presbyter Antiochus, of exhorting you to pray for me as you are wont,
and offering in our communication by letter some consolation for our
long separation.  And, when you pray, I ask you to beg from the Lord
this as the first and greatest boon, that I may be delivered from vile
and wicked men, who have gained such power over the people that now I
seem to see, indeed, a repetition of the events of the taking of
Jerusalem. <span id="fr_3015"></span>[3016](#fn_3015)   For the weaker
grow the Churches the more does men’s lust for power increase.  And now
the very title of bishop has been conferred on wretched slaves, for no
servant of God would choose to come forward in opposition to claim the
see;—no one but miserable fellows like the emissaries of Anysius the
creature of Euippius, and of Ecdicius of Parnassus:  whoever has
appointed him <span id="fr_3016"></span>[3017](#fn_3016) has sent into
the Churches a poor means of aiding his own entry into the life to come.

<span id="ix.ccxl-p7"></span>They have expelled my brother from Nyssa,
and into his place have introduced hardly a man—a mere scamp <span
id="fr_3017"></span>[3018](#fn_3017) worth only an obol or two, but, so
far as regards the ruin of the faith, a match for those who have put him
where he is.

<span id="ix.ccxl-p9"></span>At the town of Doara they have brought
shame upon the poor name of bishop, and have sent there a wretch, an
orphans’ domestic, a runaway from his own masters, to flatter a godless
woman, who formerly used George as she liked, and now has got this
fellow to succeed him.

<span id="ix.ccxl-p10"></span>And who could properly lament the
occurrences at Nicopolis?  That unhappy Fronto did, indeed, for a while
pretend to be on the side of the truth, but now he has shamefully
betrayed both the faith and himself, and for the price of his betrayal
has got a name of disgrace.  He imagines that he has obtained from these
men the rank of bishop; in reality he has become, by God’s grace, the
abomination of all Armenia.  But there is nothing that they will not
dare; nothing wherein they are at a loss for worthy accomplices.  But
the rest of the news of Syria my brother knows better, and can tell you
better, than I.

<span id="ix.ccxl-p11"></span>2.  The news of the West you know already,
on the recital of brother Dorotheus.  What sort of letters are to be
given him on his departure?  Perhaps he will travel with the excellent
Sanctissimus, who is full of enthusiasm, journeying through the East,
and collecting letters and signatures from all the men of mark. <span
id="fr_3018"></span>[3019](#fn_3018)   What ought to be written by them,
or how I can come to an agreement with those who are writing, I do not
know.  If you hear of any one soon travelling my way, be so good as to
let me know.  I am moved to say, as Diomede said,

<span id="ix.ccxl-p13"></span>“Would God, Atrides, thy request were yet
to undertake;

<span id="ix.ccxl-p14"></span>…he’s proud enough.” <span
id="fr_3019"></span>[3020](#fn_3019)

<span id="ix.ccxl-p16"></span>Really lofty souls, when they are courted,
<span id="page_281">p. 281</span> <span id="ix.ccxl-Page_281"></span>get
haughtier than ever.  If the Lord be propitious to us, what other thing
do we need?  If the anger of the Lord lasts on, what help can come to us
from the frown of the West?  Men who do not know the truth, and do not
wish to learn it, but are prejudiced by false suspicions, are doing now
as they did in the case of Marcellus, <span
id="fr_3020"></span>[3021](#fn_3020) when they quarrelled with men who
told them the truth, and by their own action strengthened the cause of
heresy.  Apart from the common document, I should like to have written
to their Coryphæus—nothing, indeed, about ecclesiastical affairs except
gently to suggest that they know nothing of what is going on here, and
will not accept the only means whereby they might learn it.  I would
say, generally, that they ought not to press hard on men who are crushed
by trials.  They must not take dignity for pride.  Sin only avails to
produce enmity against God.
