<span id="ix.cxv-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.cxv-p1.1"></span>Letter CXIV. <span
id="fr_2382"></span>[2383](#fn_2382.md) </span>

<span id="ix.cxv-p3"></span>*To Cyriacus, at Tarsus*. <span
id="fr_2383"></span>[2384](#fn_2383.md)

<span id="ix.cxv-p5"></span>I <span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cxv-p5.1"></span>need</span> hardly tell the sons of peace how
great is the blessing of peace.  But now this blessing, great,
marvellous, and worthy as it is of being most strenuously sought by all
that love the Lord, is in peril of being reduced to the bare name,
because iniquity abounds, and the love of most men has waxed cold. <span
id="fr_2384"></span>[2385](#fn_2384.md)   I think then that the one great
end of all who are really and truly serving the Lord ought to be to
bring back to union the Churches now “at sundry times and in divers
manners” <span id="fr_2385"></span>[2386](#fn_2385.md) divided from one
another.  In attempting myself to effect this, I cannot fairly be blamed
as a busybody, for nothing is so characteristically Christian as the
being a peacemaker, and for this reason our Lord has promised us
peacemakers a very high reward.

<span id="ix.cxv-p8"></span>When, therefore, I had met the brethren, and
learnt how great was their brotherly love, their regard for you, and yet
more their love for Christ, and their exactitude and firmness in all
that concerns the faith, and moreover their earnestness in compassing
two ends, the not being separated from your love, and the not abandoning
their sound faith, I approved of their good disposition; and I now write
to your reverence beseeching you with all love to retain them in true
union, and associated with you in all your anxiety for the Church.  I
have moreover pledged myself to them for your orthodoxy, and that you
too by God’s grace are enrolled to fight with all vigour for the truth,
whatever you may have to suffer for the true doctrine.  My own opinion
is that the following conditions are such as will not run counter to
your own feeling and will be quite sufficient to satisfy the above
mentioned brethren; namely, that you should confess the faith put forth
by our Fathers once assembled at Nicæa, that you should not omit any one
of its propositions, but bear in mind that the three hundred and
eighteen who met together without strife did not speak without the
operation of the Holy Ghost, and not to add to that creed the statement
that the Holy Ghost is a creature, nor hold communion with those who so
say, to the end that the Church of God may be pure and without any evil
admixture of any tare.  If this full assurance is given them by your
good feeling, they are prepared to offer proper submission to you.  And
I myself promise for the brethren that they will offer no opposition,
but will show themselves entirely subordinate, if only your excellency
shall have readily granted this one thing which they ask for.
