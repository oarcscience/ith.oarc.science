<span id="ix.cclxv-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.cclxv-p1.1"></span>Letter CCLXIV. <span
id="fr_3194"></span>[3195](#fn_3194.md) </span>

<span id="ix.cclxv-p3"></span>*To Barses, bishop of Edessa, in
exile.* <span id="fr_3195"></span>[3196](#fn_3195.md)

<span id="ix.cclxv-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cclxv-p5.1"></span>To</span> Barses the bishop, truly God-beloved
and worthy of all reverence and honour, Basil sends greeting in the
Lord.  As my dear brother Domninus <span
id="fr_3196"></span>[3197](#fn_3196.md) is setting out to you, I gladly
seize the opportunity of writing, and I greet you by him, praying the
holy God that we may be so long preserved in this life as to be
permitted to see you, and to enjoy the good gifts which you possess. 
Only pray, I beseech you, that the Lord may not deliver us for aye to
the enemies of the Cross of Christ, but that He will keep His Churches,
until the time of that peace which the just Judge Himself knows when He
will bestow.  For He will bestow it.  He will not always abandon us.  As
He limited seventy years <span id="fr_3197"></span>[3198](#fn_3197.md) for
the period of captivity for the Israelites in punishment for their sins,
so peradventure the Mighty One, after giving us up for some appointed
time, will recall us once again, and will restore us to the peace of the
beginning—unless indeed the apostasy is now nigh at hand, and the events
that have lately happened are the beginnings of the approach of
Antichrist.  If this be so, pray that the good Lord will either take
away our afflictions, or preserve us through our afflictions
unvanquished.  Through you I greet all those who have been thought
worthy to be associated with you.  All who are with me salute your
reverence.  May you, by the grace of the Holy One, be preserved to the
Church of God in good health, trusting in the Lord, and praying for me.
