<span id="ix.clxv-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.clxv-p1.1"></span>Letter CLXIV. <span
id="fr_2546"></span>[2547](#fn_2546.md) </span>

<span id="ix.clxv-p3"></span>*To Ascholius*. <span
id="fr_2547"></span>[2548](#fn_2547.md)

<span id="ix.clxv-p5"></span>1.  <span class="c14"><span
id="ix.clxv-p5.1"></span>It</span> would not be easy for me to say how
very much delighted I am with your holiness’s letter.  My words are too
weak to express all that I feel; you, however, ought to be able to
conjecture it, from the beauty of what you have written.  For what did
not your letter contain?  It contained love to God; the marvellous
description of the martyrs, which put the manner of their good fight so
plainly before me that I seemed actually to see it; love and kindness to
myself; <span id="page_216">p. 216</span> <span
id="ix.clxv-Page_216"></span>words of surpassing beauty.  So when I had
taken it into my hands, and read it many times, and perceived how
abundantly full it was of the grace of the Spirit, I thought that I had
gone back to the good old times, when God’s Churches flourished, rooted
in faith, united in love, all the members being in harmony, as though in
one body.  Then the persecutors were manifest, and manifest too the
persecuted.  Then the people grew more numerous by being attacked.  Then
the blood of the martyrs, watering the Churches, nourished many more
champions of true religion, each generation stripping for the struggle
with the zeal of those that had gone before.  Then we Christians were in
peace with one another, the peace which the Lord bequeathed us, of
which, so cruelly have we driven it from among us, not a single trace is
now left us.  Yet my soul did go back to that blessedness of old, when a
letter came from a long distance, bright with the beauty of love, and a
martyr travelled to me from wild regions beyond the Danube, preaching in
his own person the exactitude of the faith which is there observed.  Who
could tell the delight of my soul at all this?  What power of speech
could be devised competent to describe all that I felt in the bottom of
my heart?  However, when I saw the athlete, I blessed his trainer:  he,
too, before the just Judge, after strengthening many for the conflict on
behalf of true religion, shall receive the crown of righteousness.

<span id="ix.clxv-p6"></span>2.  By bringing the blessed Eutyches <span
id="fr_2548"></span>[2549](#fn_2548.md) to my recollection, and honouring
my country for having sown the seeds of true religion, you have at once
delighted me by your reminder of the past, and distressed me by your
conviction of the present.  None of us now comes near Eutyches in
goodness:  so far are we from bringing barbarians under the softening
power of the Spirit, and the operation of His graces, that by the
greatness of our sins we turn gentle hearted men into barbarians, for to
ourselves and to our sins I attribute it that the influence of the
heretics is so widely diffused.  Peradventure no part of the world has
escaped the conflagration of heresy.  You tell me of struggles of
athletes, bodies lacerated for the truth’s sake, savage fury despised by
men of fearless heart, various tortures of persecutors, and constancy of
the wrestlers through them all, the block and the water whereby the
martyrs died. <span id="fr_2549"></span>[2550](#fn_2549.md)   And what is
our condition?  Love is grown cold; the teaching of the Fathers is being
laid waste; everywhere is shipwreck of the Faith; the mouths of the
Faithful are silent; the people, driven from the houses of prayer, lift
up their hands in the open air to their Lord which is in heaven.  Our
afflictions are heavy, martyrdom is nowhere to be seen, because those
who evilly entreat us are called by the same name as ourselves. 
Wherefore pray to the Lord yourself, and join all Christ’s noble
athletes with you in prayer for the Churches, to the end that, if any
further time remains for this world, and all things are not being driven
to destruction, God may be reconciled to his own Churches and restore
them to their ancient peace.

<span id="ix.clxv-p7"></span> Eutyches was a Cappadocian, who was taken
prisoner by the Goths, in the reign of Gallienus, in a raid into
Cappadocia.  It was through the teaching of these captives that the
ancestors of Ulphilas became Christians.  *cf.* Philost., *H.E.* ii. 5.

<span id="ix.clxv-p8"></span> The Ben. note illustrates these modes of
martyrdom from the letter of the Gothic Church, supposed to have been
written by Ascholius, sent to Cæsarea with the body of Saint Sabas, who
suffered under Athanaricus, king of the Goths, in the end of the fourth
century.  “They bring him down to the water, giving thanks and
glorifying God; then they flung him down, and put a block about his
neck, and plunged him into the depth.  So slain by wood and water, he
kept the symbol of salvation undefiled, being 38 years old.”  *cf*.
Ruinart., *Act. Sinc*. p. 670.
