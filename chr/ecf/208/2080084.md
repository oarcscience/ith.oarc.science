<span id="ix.xii-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.xii-p5.1"></span>After</span> by God’s grace I had passed the
sacred day with our sons, and had kept a really perfect feast to the
Lord because of their exceeding love to God, I sent them in good health
to your excellency, with a prayer to our loving God to give them an
angel of peace to help and accompany them, and to grant them to find you
in good health and assured tranquillity, to the end that wherever your
lot may be cast, I to the end of my days, whenever I hear news of you,
may be gladdened to think of you as serving and giving thanks to the
Lord.  If God should grant you to be quickly freed from these cares I
beg you to let nothing stand in the way of your coming to stay with me. 
I think you will find none to love you so well, or to make more of your
friendship.  So long, then, as the Holy One ordains this separation, be
sure that you never lose an opportunity of comforting me by a letter.
