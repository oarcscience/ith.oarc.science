<span id="ix.cccxxxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.cccxxxiv-p1.1"></span>Letter CCCXXXIX.</span>

<span id="ix.cccxxxiv-p2"></span>Basil to Libanius.

<span id="ix.cccxxxiv-p3"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cccxxxiv-p3.1"></span>What</span> could not a sophist say?  And
such a sophist!  One whose peculiar art is, whenever he likes, to make
great things small, and to give greatness to small things!  This is what
you have shewn in my case.  That dirty little letter of mine, as,
perhaps, you who live in all luxury of eloquence would call it, a letter
in no way more tolerable than the one you hold in your hands now, you
have so extolled as, forsooth, to be eaten by it, and to be yielding me
the prize for composition!  You are acting much as fathers do, when they
join in their boys’ games, and let the little fellows be proud of the
victories which they have let them win without any loss to themselves,
and with much gain to the children’s emulation.  Really and truly the
delight your speech must have given, when you were joking about me, must
have been indescribable!  It is as though some Polydamas <span
id="fr_3269"></span>[3270](#fn_3269.md) or Milo <span
id="fr_3270"></span>[3271](#fn_3270.md) were to decline the pancratium or a
wrestling bout with me! <span id="fr_3271"></span>[3272](#fn_3271.md)  
After carefully examining, I have found no sign of weakness.  So those
who look for exaggeration are the more astonished at your being able to
descend in sport to my level, than if you had led the barbarian in full
sail over Athos. <span id="fr_3272"></span>[3273](#fn_3272.md)   I,
however, my dear sir, am now spending my time with Moses and Elias, and
saints like them, who tell me their stories in a barbarous tongue, <span
id="fr_3273"></span>[3274](#fn_3273.md) and I utter what I learnt from
them, true, indeed, in sense, though rude in phrase, as what I am
writing testifies.  If ever I learned anything from you, I have
forgotten it in the course of time.  But do you continue to write to me,
and so suggest other topics for correspondence.  Your letter will
exhibit you, and will not convict me.  I have already introduced to you
the son of Anysius, as a son of my own.  If he is my son, he is the
child of his father, poor, and a poor man’s son.  What I am saying is
well known to one who is wise as well as a sophist. <span

<span id="ix.cccxxxiv-p7"></span> The story that Xerxes had made a canal
through the isthmus of Athos was supposed to be an instance of gross
exaggeration.  *cf*. Juv. x. 174:  *Creditur olim Velificatus Athos et
quidquid Græcia mendax Audet in historia*,” and Claudian iii. 336: 
“*Remige Medo solicitatus Athos*.”  But traces of the canal are said to
be still visible.

<span id="ix.cccxxxiv-p8"></span> This might lead to the idea that Basil
knew some Hebrew, but the close of the sentence indicates that he means
the Greek of the LXX., in which he always quotes Scripture.
