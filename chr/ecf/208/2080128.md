<span id="ix.lvi-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.lvi-p1.1"></span>Letter LV. <span
id="fr_2202"></span>[2203](#fn_2202) </span>

<span id="ix.lvi-p3"></span>*To Paregorius, the presbyter*.

<span id="ix.lvi-p4"></span>I <span class="c14"><span
id="ix.lvi-p4.1"></span>have</span> given patient attention to your
letter, and I am astonished that when you are perfectly well able to
furnish me with a short and easy defence by taking action at once, you
should choose to persist in what is my ground of complaint, and
endeavour to cure the incurable by writing a long story about it.  I am
not the first, Paregorius, nor the only man, to lay down the law that
women are not to live with men.  Read the canon put forth by our holy
Fathers at the Council of Nicæa, which distinctly forbids
subintroducts.  Unmarried life is honourably distinguished by its being
cut off from all female society.  If, then, any one, who is known by the
outward profession, in reality follows the example of those who live
with wives, it is obvious that he only affects the distinction of
virginity in name, and does not hold aloof from unbecoming indulgence. 
You ought to have been all the more ready to submit yourself without
difficulty to my demands, in that you allege that you are free from all
bodily appetite.  I do not suppose that a man of three score years and
ten lives with a woman from any such feelings, and I have not decided,
as I have decided, on the ground of any crime having been committed. 
But we have learnt from the Apostle, not to put a stumbling block or an
occasion to fall in a brother’s way;” <span
id="fr_2203"></span>[2204](#fn_2203) and I know that what is done very
properly by some, naturally becomes to others an occasion for sin.  I
have therefore given my order, in obedience to the injunction of the
holy Fathers, that you are to separate from the woman.  Why then, do you
find fault with the Chorepiscopus?  What is the good of mentioning
ancient ill-will?  Why do you blame me for lending an easy ear to
slander?  Why do you not rather lay the blame on yourself, for not
consenting to break off your connexion with the woman?  Expel her from
your house, and establish her in a monastery.  Let her live with
virgins, and do you be served by men, that the name of God be not
blasphemed in you.  Till you have so done, the innumerable arguments,
which you use in your letters, will not do you the slightest service. 
You will die useless, and you will have to give an account to God for
your uselessness.  If you persist in clinging to your clerical position
without correcting your ways, you will be accursed before all the
people, and all, who receive you, will be excommunicate throughout the
Church. <span id="fr_2204"></span>[2205](#fn_2204)

one of the greatest difficulties and scandals of the early church,
*vide* the article of Can. Venables in *D.C.A*. ii. 1937.  The earliest
prohibitive canon against the custom is that of the Council of Elvira,
<span class="c14"><span id="ix.lvi-p6.2"></span>a.d.</span> 305.  (Labbe
i. 973.)  The Canon of Nicæa, to which Basil refers, only allowed the
introduction of a mother, sister, or aunt.  The still more extraordinary
and perilous custom of ladies of professed celibacy entertaining male

Shepherd of Hermas” (iii. Simil. ix. 11).  On the charges against Paul
of Samosata under this head, *vide* Eusebius, vii. 30.
