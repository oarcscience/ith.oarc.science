<span id="ix.ccxxxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.ccxxxviii-p1.1"></span>Letter CCXXXVII. <span
id="fr_3001"></span>[3002](#fn_3001.md) </span>

<span id="ix.ccxxxviii-p3"></span>To Eusebius, bishop of Samosata.

<span id="ix.ccxxxviii-p4"></span>1.  <span class="c14"><span
id="ix.ccxxxviii-p4.1"></span>I both</span> wrote to your reverence by
the vicar of Thrace, and sent other letters by one of the officers of
the treasury of Philippopolis, who was starting from our country into
Thrace, and begged him to take them on his departure.  But the vicar
never received my letter, for while I was visiting my diocese, <span
id="fr_3002"></span>[3003](#fn_3002.md) he came into town in the evening
and started early in the morning, so that the church officers did not
know of his coming, and the letter remained at my house.  The treasurer,
too, on account of some unexpected and urgent business, set out without
seeing me or taking my letters.  No one else could be found; so I
remained, sorry at not being able to write to you and at not receiving
any letter from your reverence.  Yet I was wishful, were it possible, to
tell you all that happens to me day by day.  So many astonishing things
happen as to need a daily narrative, and you may be sure that I would
have written one, unless my mind had been diverted from its purpose by
the pressure of events.

<span id="ix.ccxxxviii-p6"></span>2.  The first and greatest of my
troubles was the visit of the Vicar.  As to whether he is a man really
heretically minded I do not know; for I think that he is quite unversed
in doctrine, and has not the slightest interest or experience in such
things, for I see him day and night busy, both in body and soul, in
other things.  But he is certainly a friend of heretics; and he is not
more friendly to them than he is ill-disposed to me.  He has summoned a
synod of wicked men in mid-winter in Galatia. <span
id="fr_3003"></span>[3004](#fn_3003.md)   He has deposed Hypsinus and set
up Ecdicius in his place. <span id="fr_3004"></span>[3005](#fn_3004.md)  
He has ordered the removal of my brother on the accusation of one man,
and that one quite insignificant.  Then, after being occupied for some
little time about the army, he came to us again breathing rage and
slaughter, <span id="fr_3005"></span>[3006](#fn_3005.md) and, in one
sentence, delivered all the Church of Cæsarea to the Senate.  He settled
for several days at Sebaste, separating friends from foes, <span
id="fr_3006"></span>[3007](#fn_3006.md) calling those in communion with me
senators, and condemning them to the public service, while he advanced
the adherents of Eustathius.  He has ordered a second synod of bishops
of Galatia and Pontus to be assembled at Nyssa. <span
id="fr_3007"></span>[3008](#fn_3007.md)   They have submitted, have met,
and have sent to the Churches a man of whose character I do not like to
speak; but your reverence can well understand what sort of a man he must
be who would put himself at the disposal of such counsels of men. <span
id="fr_3008"></span>[3009](#fn_3008.md)   Now, while I am thus writing, the
same gang have hurried to Sebaste to unite with Eustathius, and, with
him, to upset the Church of Nicopolis.  For the blessed Theodotus has
fallen asleep.  Hitherto the Nicopolitans have bravely and stoutly
resisted the vicar’s first assault; for he tried to persuade them to
receive Eustathius, and to accept their bishop on his appointment.  But,
on seeing them unwilling to yield, he is now trying, by yet more violent
action, to effect the establishment of the bishop whom it has been
attempted to give them. <span id="fr_3009"></span>[3010](#fn_3009.md)  
There is, moreover, said to be some rumoured expectation of a synod, by
which means they mean to summon me to receive them into communion, or to
be friendly with them.  Such is the position of the Churches.  As to my
own health, I think it better to say nothing.  I cannot bear not to tell
the truth, and by telling the truth I shall only grieve you.
