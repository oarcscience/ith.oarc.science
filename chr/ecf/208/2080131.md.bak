<span id="ix.lix-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.lix-p1.1"></span>Letter LVIII. <span
id="fr_2210"></span>[2211](#fn_2210.md) </span>

<span id="ix.lix-p3"></span>*To Gregory my brother*. <span
id="fr_2211"></span>[2212](#fn_2211.md)

<span id="ix.lix-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.lix-p5.1"></span>How</span> am I to dispute with you in writing? 
How can I lay hold of you satisfactorily, with all your simplicity? 
Tell me; who ever falls a third time into the same nets?  Who ever gets
a third time into the same snare?  Even a brute beast would find it
difficult to do so.  You forged one letter, and brought it me as though
it came from our right reverend uncle the bishop, trying to deceive me,
I have no idea why.  I received it as a letter written by the bishop and
delivered by you.  Why should I not?  I was delighted; I shewed it to
many of my friends; I thanked God.  The forgery was found out, on the
bishop’s repudiating it in person.  I was thoroughly ashamed; covered as
I was with the disgrace of cunning trickery and lies, I prayed that the
earth might open for me.  Then they gave me a second letter, as sent by
the bishop himself by the hands of your servant Asterius.  Even this
second had not really been sent by the bishop, as my very reverend
brother Anthimus <span id="fr_2212"></span>[2213](#fn_2212.md) has told
me.  Now Adamantius has come bringing me a third.  How ought I to
receive a letter carried by you or yours?  I might have prayed to have a
heart of stone, so as neither to remember the past, nor to feel the
present; so as to bear every blow, like cattle, with bowed head.  But
what am I to think, now that, after my first and second experience, I
can admit nothing without positive proof?  Thus I write attacking your
simplicity, which I see plainly to be neither what generally becomes a
Christian man, nor is appropriate to the present emergency; I write
<span id="page_160">p. 160</span> <span
id="ix.lix-Page_160"></span>that, at least for the future, you may take
care of yourself and spare me.  I must speak to you with all freedom,
and I tell you that you are an unworthy minister of things so great. 
However, whoever be the writer of the letter, I have answered as is fit
.  Whether, then, you yourself are experimenting on me, or whether
really the letter which you have sent is one which you have received
from the bishops, you have my answer.  At such a time as this you ought
to have borne in mind that you are my brother, and have not yet
forgotten the ties of nature, and do not regard me in the light of an
enemy, for I have entered on a life which is wearing out my strength,
and is so far beyond my powers that it is injuring even my soul.  Yet
for all this, as you have determined to declare war against me, you
ought to have come to me and shared my troubles.  For it is said,
“Brethren and help are against time of trouble.” <span
id="fr_2213"></span>[2214](#fn_2213.md)   If the right reverend bishops are
really willing to meet me, let them make known to me a place and time,
and let them invite me by their own men.  I do not refuse to meet my own
uncle, but I shall not do so unless the invitation reaches me in due and
proper form. <span id="fr_2214"></span>[2215](#fn_2214.md)

class="Greek"><span id="ix.lix-p4.2"></span>Γρηγορίω ἐπισκόπῳ καὶ
ἀδελφῷ</span>, but, as is pointed out by the Ben. Ed., the letter itself
is hardly one which would be written to one with the responsibilities of
a bishop.  Basil seems to regard his brother as at liberty to come and
help him at Cæsarea.  Gregory’s consecration to the see of Nyssa is
placed in 372, when his reluctance had to be overcome by force.  *cf.
Letter* ccxxv.  On the extraordinary circumstance of his well meant but
futile forgery of the name of his namesake and uncle, bishop of an
unknown see, *vide* Prolegom.

Erat Basilius, ut in ejus modi officiis exhibendis diligentissimus, ita
etiam in reposcendis attentus.  Meletius Antiochenus et Theodorus
Nicopolitanus, cum Basilium ad celebritatem quamdam obiter advocassent
per Hellenium Nazianzi Peræquatorem, nec iterum misissent qui de visdem
admoneret aut deduceret; displicuit Basilio perfunctoria invitandi
ratio, ac veritus ne suspectus illis esset, adesse noluit*.”  Note by
Ben. Ed.
