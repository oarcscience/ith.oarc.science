<p class="c20"><a name="ix.cclxxxi-p4"></A>I <span class="c14"><a name="ix.cclxxxi-p4.1"></A>feel</span> my boldness in pressing my suit by letter upon a man in your position; still the honour that you have paid me in the past has banished all my scruples.&#160; Accordingly I write with confidence.</p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="ix.cclxxxi-p5"></A>My plea is for a relative of mine, a man worthy of respect for his integrity.&#160; He is the bearer of this letter, and he stands to me in the place of a son.&#160; Your favour is all that he requires for the fulfilment of his wishes.&#160; Deign therefore to receive, at the hands of the aforesaid bearer, my letter in furtherance of his plea.&#160; I pray you to give him an opportunity of explaining his affairs at an interview with those in a position to help him.&#160; So by your direction shall he quickly obtain his desires; while I shall have occasion for boasting that by God&#146;s favour I have found a champion who regards the entreaties of my friends as personal claims to his protection.</p>
