id="fr_3028"></span>[3029](#fn_3028.md) </span>

<span id="ix.ccxlii-p3"></span>*To Eusebius, bishop of Samosata*.

<span id="ix.ccxlii-p4"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.ccxlii-p4.1"></span>It</span> is not to increase your distress
that I am so lavish of painful topics in my letters to your excellency. 
My object is to get some comfort for myself in the lamentations which
are a kind of natural means of dispersing deep-seated pain whenever they
are produced, and further to rouse you, my great-hearted friend, to more
earnest prayer on behalf of the Churches.  We know that Moses prayed
continually for the people; yet, when his battle with Amalek had begun,
he did not let down his hands from morning to evening, and the uplifting
of the hands of the saint only ended with the end of the fight.
