<span id="ix.xx-p5"></span>I <span class="c14"><span
id="ix.xx-p5.1"></span>received</span> a letter from you the day before
yesterday.  It is shewn to be yours not so much by the handwriting as by
the peculiar style.  Much meaning is expressed in few words.  I did not
reply on the spot, because I was away from home, and the letter-carrier,
after he had delivered the packet to one of my friends, went away.  Now,
however, I am able to address you through Peter, and at the same time
both to return your greeting, and give you an opportunity for another
letter.  There is certainly no trouble in writing a laconic dispatch
like those which reach me from you.
