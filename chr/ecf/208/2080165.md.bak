greeting in the Lord.  Souls in anguish find some consolation in sending
sigh after sigh from the bottom of the heart, and even a tear shed
breaks the force of affliction.  But sighs and tears give us less
consolation than the opportunity of telling our troubles to your love. 
We are moreover cheered by the better hope that, peradventure, if we
announce our troubles to you, we may move you to give us that succour
which we have long hoped you would give the Churches in the East, but
which we have not yet received; God, Who in His wisdom arranges all
things, must have ordained according to the hidden judgments of His
righteousness, that we should be tried for a longer time in these
temptations.  The fame of our condition has travelled to the ends of the
earth, and you are not ignorant of it; nor are you without sympathy with
brethren of like mind with yourselves, for you are disciples of the
apostle, who teaches us that love for our neighbour is the fulfilling of
the law. <span id="fr_2325"></span>[2326](#fn_2325.md)   But, as we have
said, the just judgment of God, which has ordained that the affliction
due to our sins must be fulfilled, has held you back.  But when you have
learnt all, specially what has not hitherto reached your ears, from our
reverend brother the deacon Sabinus, who will be able to narrate in
person what is omitted in our letter, we do beseech you to be roused
both to zeal for the truth and sympathy for us.  We implore you to put
on bowels of mercy, to lay aside all hesitation, and to undertake the
labour of love, without counting length of way, your own occupations, or
any other human interests.

<span id="ix.xciii-p22"></span><span id="page_178">p. 178</span> <span
id="ix.xciii-Page_178"></span>2.  It is not only one Church which is in
peril, nor yet two or three which have fallen under this terrible
storm.  The mischief of this heresy spreads almost from the borders of
Illyricum to the Thebaid.  Its bad seeds were first sown by the infamous
Arius; they then took deep root through the labours of many who
vigorously cultivated the impiety between his time and ours.  Now they
have produced their deadly fruit.  The doctrines of true religion are
overthrown.  The laws of the Church are in confusion.  The ambition of
men, who have no fear of God, rushes into high posts, and exalted office
is now publicly known as the prize of impiety.  The result is, that the
worse a man blasphemes, the fitter the people think him to be a bishop. 
Clerical dignity is a thing of the past.  There is a complete lack of
men shepherding the Lord’s flock with knowledge.  Ambitious men are
constantly throwing away the provision for the poor on their own
enjoyment and the distribution of gifts.  There is no precise knowledge
of canons.  There is complete immunity in sinning; for when men have
been placed in office by the favour of men, they are obliged to return
the favour by continually showing indulgence to offenders.  Just
judgment is a thing of the past; and everyone walks according to his
heart’s desire.  Vice knows no bounds; the people know no restraint. 
Men in authority are afraid to speak, for those who have reached power
by human interest are the slaves of those to whom they owe their
advancement.  And now the very vindication of orthodoxy is looked upon
in some quarters as an opportunity for mutual attack; and men conceal
their private ill-will and pretend that their hostility is all for the
sake of the truth.  Others, afraid of being convicted of disgraceful
crimes, madden the people into fratricidal quarrels, that their own
doings may be unnoticed in the general distress.  Hence the war admits
of no truce, for the doers of ill deeds are afraid of a peace, as being
likely to lift the veil from their secret infamy.  All the while
unbelievers laugh; men of weak faith are shaken; faith is uncertain;
souls are drenched in ignorance, because adulterators of the word
imitate the truth.  The mouths of true believers are dumb, while every
blasphemous tongue wags free; holy things are trodden under foot; the
better laity shun the churches as schools of impiety; and lift their
hands in the deserts with sighs and tears to their Lord in heaven.  Even
you must have heard what is going on in most of our cities, how our
people with wives and children and even our old men stream out before
the walls, and offer their prayers in the open air, putting up with all
the inconvenience of the weather with great patience, and waiting for
help from the Lord.

<span id="ix.xciii-p23"></span>3.  What lamentation can match these
woes?  What springs of tears are sufficient for them?  While, then, some
men do seem to stand, while yet a trace of the old state of things is
left, before utter shipwreck comes upon the Churches, hasten to us,
hasten to us now, true brothers, we implore you; on our knees we implore
you, hold out a helping hand.  May your brotherly bowels be moved toward
us; may tears of sympathy flow; do not see, unmoved, half the empire
swallowed up by error; do not let the light of the faith be put out in
the place where it shone first.

<span id="ix.xciii-p24"></span>By what action you can then help matters,
and how you are to show sympathy for the afflicted, you do not want to
be told by us; the Holy Ghost will suggest to you.  But unquestionably,
if the survivors are to be saved, there is need of prompt action, and of
the arrival of a considerable number of brethren, that those who visit
us may complete the number of the synod, in order that they may have
weight in effecting a reform, not merely from the dignity of those whose
emissaries they are, but also from their own number:  thus they will
restore the creed drawn up by our fathers at Nicæa, proscribe the
heresy, and, by bringing into agreement all who are of one mind, speak
peace to the Churches.  For the saddest thing about it all is that the
sound part is divided against itself, and the troubles we are suffering
are like those which once befel Jerusalem when Vespasian was besieging
it.  The Jews of that time were at once beset by foes without and
consumed by the internal sedition of their own people.  In our case,
too, in addition to the open attack of the heretics, the Churches are
reduced to utter helplessness by the war raging among those who are
supposed to be orthodox.  For all these reasons we do indeed desire your
help, that, for the future all who confess the apostolic faith may put
an end to the schisms which they have unhappily devised, and be reduced
for the future to the authority of the Church; that so, once more, the
body of Christ may be complete, restored to integrity with all its
members.  Thus we shall not only praise the blessings of others, which
is all we can do now, but see our own Churches once more restored to
their pristine boast of orthodoxy.  For, truly, the boon given you by
<span id="page_179">p. 179</span> <span
id="ix.xciii-Page_179"></span>the Lord is fit subject for the highest
congratulation, your power of discernment between the spurious and the
genuine and pure, and your preaching the faith of the Fathers without
any dissimulation.  That faith we have received; that faith we know is
stamped with the marks of the Apostles; to that faith we assent, as well
as to all that was canonically and lawfully promulgated in the Synodical
Letter. <span id="fr_2326"></span>[2327](#fn_2326.md)

<span id="ix.xciii-p25"></span> After noting that the Synodical Letter
is to be found in Theodoret and in Sozomen (*i.e.* is in Theodoret I.
viii. and in Socrates I. ix.) the Ben. Ed. express surprise that Basil
should indicate concurrence with the Synodical Letter, which defines the
Son to be <span class="Greek"><span id="ix.xciii-p25.1"></span>τῆς
αὐτῆς</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.xciii-p25.2"></span>ὑ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.xciii-p25.3"></span>ποστασεως καὶ οὐσίας</span>, while he is
known to have taught the distinction between <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.xciii-p25.4"></span>ὑ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.xciii-p25.5"></span>πόστασις</span> and <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.xciii-p25.6"></span>οὐσία</span>.  As a matter of fact, it is not
in the Synodical Letter, but in the anathemas originally appended to the
creed, that it is, not asserted that the Son is of the same, but, denied
that He is of a different <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.xciii-p25.7"></span>οὐσία</span> or <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.xciii-p25.8"></span>ὑ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.xciii-p25.9"></span>πόστασις</span>.  On the distinction between
<span class="Greek"><span id="ix.xciii-p25.10"></span>οὐσία</span> and
<span class="Greek"><span id="ix.xciii-p25.11"></span>ὑ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.xciii-p25.12"></span>πόστασις</span> see
*Letters* xxxviii., cxxv., and ccxxxvi. and the *De Sp. Sancto*. § 7. 
On the difficulty of expressing the terms in Latin, *cf. Letter* ccxiv. 
As <span class="Greek"><span id="ix.xciii-p25.13"></span>ὑ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.xciii-p25.14"></span>πόστασις</span> was in
325 understood to be equivalent to <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.xciii-p25.15"></span>οὐσία</span>, and in 370 had acquired a
different connotation, it would be no more difficult for Basil than for
the Church now, to assent to what is called the Nicene position, while
confessing three hypostases.  In *Letter* cxxv. Basil does indeed try to
shew, but apparently without success, that to condemn the statement that
He is of a different hypostasis is not equivalent to asserting Him to be
of the same hypostasis.
