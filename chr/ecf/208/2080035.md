<span id="vii.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vii.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter V.</span>

<span id="vii.vi-p2"></span>That “through whom” is said also in the case
of the Father, and “of whom” in the case of the Son and of the Spirit.

<span id="vii.vi-p3"></span>7.  <span class="c14"><span
id="vii.vi-p3.1"></span>After</span> thus describing the outcome of our
adversaries’ arguments, we shall now proceed to shew, as we have
proposed, that the Father does not first take “of whom” and then abandon
“through whom” to the Son; and that there is no truth in these men’s
ruling that the Son refuses to admit the Holy Spirit to a share in “of
whom” or in “through whom,” according to the limitation of their
new-fangled allotment of phrases.  “There is one God and Father of whom
are all things, and one Lord Jesus Christ through whom are all
things.” <span id="fr_733"></span>[734](#fn_733.md)

<span id="vii.vi-p5"></span>Yes; but these are the words of a writer not
laying down a rule, but carefully distinguishing the hypostases. <span
id="fr_734"></span>[735](#fn_734.md)

<span id="vii.vi-p7"></span>The object of the apostle in thus writing
was not to introduce the diversity of nature, but to exhibit the notion
of Father and of Son as unconfounded.  That the phrases are not opposed
to one another and do not, like squadrons in war marshalled one against
another, bring the natures to which they are applied into mutual
conflict, is perfectly plain from the passage in question.  The blessed
Paul brings both phrases to bear upon one and the same subject, in the
words “of him and through him and to him are all things.” <span
id="fr_735"></span>[736](#fn_735.md)   That this plainly refers to the Lord
will be admitted even by a reader paying but small attention to the
meaning of the words.  The apostle has just quoted from the prophecy of
Isaiah, “Who hath known the mind of the Lord, or who hath <span
id="page_6">p. 6</span> <span id="vii.vi-Page_6"></span>been his
counsellor,” <span id="fr_736"></span>[737](#fn_736.md) and then goes on,
“For of him and from him and to him are all things.”  That the prophet
is speaking about God the Word, the Maker of all creation, may be learnt
from what immediately precedes:  “Who hath measured the waters in the
hollow of his hand, and meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended
the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales,
and the hills in a balance?  Who hath directed the Spirit of the Lord,
or being his counsellor hath taught him?” <span
id="fr_737"></span>[738](#fn_737.md)   Now the word “who” in this passage
does not mean absolute impossibility, but rarity, as in the passage “Who
will rise up for me against the evil doers?” <span
id="fr_738"></span>[739](#fn_738.md) and “What man is he that desireth
life?” <span id="fr_739"></span>[740](#fn_739.md) and “Who shall ascend
into the hill of the Lord?” <span id="fr_740"></span>[741](#fn_740.md)   So
is it in the passage in question, “Who hath directed \[lxx., known\] the
Spirit of the Lord, or being his counsellor hath known him?”  “For the
Father loveth the Son and sheweth him all things.” <span
id="fr_741"></span>[742](#fn_741.md)   This is He who holds the earth, and
hath grasped it with His hand, who brought all things to order and
adornment, who poised <span id="fr_742"></span>[743](#fn_742.md) the hills
in their places, and measured the waters, and gave to all things in the
universe their proper rank, who encompasseth the whole of heaven with
but a small portion of His power, which, in a figure, the prophet calls
a span.  Well then did the apostle add “Of him and through him and to
him are all things.” <span id="fr_743"></span>[744](#fn_743.md)   For of
Him, to all things that are, comes the cause of their being, according
to the will of God the Father.  Through Him all things have their
continuance <span id="fr_744"></span>[745](#fn_744.md) and
constitution, <span id="fr_745"></span>[746](#fn_745.md) for He created all
things, and metes out to each severally what is necessary for its health
and preservation.  Wherefore to Him all things are turned, looking with
irresistible longing and unspeakable affection to “the author” <span
id="fr_746"></span>[747](#fn_746.md) and maintainer “of” their “life,” as
it is written “The eyes of all wait upon thee,” <span
id="fr_747"></span>[748](#fn_747.md) and again, “These wait all upon
thee,” <span id="fr_748"></span>[749](#fn_748.md) and “Thou openest thine
hand, and satisfiest the desire of every living thing.” <span
id="fr_749"></span>[750](#fn_749.md)

<span id="vii.vi-p23"></span>8.  But if our adversaries oppose this our
interpretation, what argument will save them from being caught in their
own trap?

<span id="vii.vi-p24"></span>For if they will not grant that the three
expressions “of him” and “through him” and “to him” are spoken of the
Lord, they cannot but be applied to God the Father.  Then without
question their rule will fall through, for we find not only “of whom,”
but also “through whom” applied to the Father.  And if this latter
phrase indicates nothing derogatory, why in the world should it be
confined, as though conveying the sense of inferiority, to the Son?  If
it always and everywhere implies ministry, let them tell us to what
superior the God of glory <span id="fr_750"></span>[751](#fn_750.md) and
Father of the Christ is subordinate.

<span id="vii.vi-p26"></span>They are thus overthrown by their own
selves, while our position will be on both sides made sure.  Suppose it
proved that the passage refers to the Son, “of whom” will be found
applicable to the Son.  Suppose on the other hand it be insisted that
the prophet’s words relate to God, then it will be granted that “through
whom” is properly used of God, and both phrases have equal value, in
that both are used with equal force of God.  Under either alternative
both terms, being employed of one and the same Person, will be shewn to
be equivalent.  But let us revert to our subject.

<span id="vii.vi-p27"></span>9.  In his Epistle to the Ephesians the
apostle says, “But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in
all things, which is the head, even Christ; from whom the whole body
fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth,
according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh
increase of the body.” <span id="fr_751"></span>[752](#fn_751.md)

<span id="vii.vi-p29"></span>And again in the Epistle to the Colossians,
to them that have not the knowledge of the Only Begotten, there is
mention of him that holdeth “the head,” that is, Christ, “from which all
the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered increaseth
with the increase of God.” <span id="fr_752"></span>[753](#fn_752.md)   And
that Christ is the head of the Church we have learned in another
passage, when the apostle says “gave him to be the head over all things
to the Church,” <span id="fr_753"></span>[754](#fn_753.md) and “of his
fulness have all we received.” <span id="fr_754"></span>[755](#fn_754.md)  
And the Lord Himself says “He shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto
you.” <span id="fr_755"></span>[756](#fn_755.md)   In a word, the diligent
reader will perceive that “of whom” is used in diverse manners. <span
id="fr_756"></span>[757](#fn_756.md)   For instance, the Lord says, “I
perceive that virtue is gone out of me.” <span
id="fr_757"></span>[758](#fn_757.md)   Similarly we have frequently
observed “of whom” used of the Spirit.  “He that soweth to the spirit,”
it is said, <span id="page_7">p. 7</span> <span
id="vii.vi-Page_7"></span>“shall of the spirit reap life
everlasting.” <span id="fr_758"></span>[759](#fn_758.md)   John too writes,
“Hereby we know that he abideth in us by (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.vi-p36.2"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.vi-p36.3"></span>κ</span>) the spirit which he hath given
us.” <span id="fr_759"></span>[760](#fn_759.md)   “That which is conceived
in her,” says the angel, “is of the Holy Ghost,” <span
id="fr_760"></span>[761](#fn_760.md) and the Lord says “that which is born
of the spirit is spirit.” <span id="fr_761"></span>[762](#fn_761.md)   Such
then is the case so far.

<span id="vii.vi-p40"></span>10.  It must now be pointed out that the
phrase “through whom” is admitted by Scripture in the case of the Father
and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost alike.  It would indeed be tedious
to bring forward evidence of this in the case of the Son, not only
because it is perfectly well known, but because this very point is made
by our opponents.  We now show that “through whom” is used also in the
case of the Father.  “God is faithful,” it is said, “by whom (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.vi-p40.1"></span>δι᾽ οὖ</span>) ye were
called unto the fellowship of his Son,” <span
id="fr_762"></span>[763](#fn_762.md) and “Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ
by (<span class="Greek"><span id="vii.vi-p41.2"></span>διά</span>) the
will of God;” and again, “Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a
son; and if a son, then an heir through God.” <span
id="fr_763"></span>[764](#fn_763.md)   And “like as Christ was raised up
from the dead by (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.vi-p42.3"></span>διά</span>) the glory of God the Father.” <span
id="fr_764"></span>[765](#fn_764.md)  Isaiah, moreover, says, “Woe unto
them that make deep counsel and not through the Lord;” <span
id="fr_765"></span>[766](#fn_765.md) and many proofs of the use of this
phrase in the case of the Spirit might be adduced.  “God hath revealed
him to us,” it is said, “by (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.vi-p44.2"></span>διά</span>) the spirit;” <span
id="fr_766"></span>[767](#fn_766.md) and in another place, “That good thing
which was committed unto thee keep by (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.vi-p45.2"></span>διά</span>) the Holy Ghost;” <span
id="fr_767"></span>[768](#fn_767.md) and again, “To one is given by (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.vi-p46.2"></span>διά</span>) the spirit the
word of wisdom.” <span id="fr_768"></span>[769](#fn_768.md)

<span id="vii.vi-p48"></span>11.  In the same manner it may also be said
of the word “in,” that Scripture admits its use in the case of God the
Father.  In the Old Testament it is said through (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.vi-p48.1"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.vi-p48.2"></span>ν</span>) God we shall do
valiantly, <span id="fr_769"></span>[770](#fn_769.md) and, “My praise shall
be continually of (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.vi-p49.2"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.vi-p49.3"></span>ν</span>) thee;” <span
id="fr_770"></span>[771](#fn_770.md) and again, “In thy name will I
rejoice.” <span id="fr_771"></span>[772](#fn_771.md)   In Paul we read, “In
God who created all things,” <span id="fr_772"></span>[773](#fn_772.md)
and, “Paul and Silvanus and Timotheus unto the church of the
Thessalonians in God our Father;” <span
id="fr_773"></span>[774](#fn_773.md) and “if now at length I might have a
prosperous journey by (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.vi-p53.2"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.vi-p53.3"></span>ν</span>) the will of God to come to
you;” <span id="fr_774"></span>[775](#fn_774.md) and, “Thou makest thy
boast of God.” <span id="fr_775"></span>[776](#fn_775.md)   Instances are
indeed too numerous to reckon; but what we want is not so much to
exhibit an abundance of evidence as to prove that the conclusions of our
opponents are unsound.  I shall, therefore, omit any proof of this usage
in the case of our Lord and of the Holy Ghost, in that it is notorious. 
But I cannot forbear to remark that “the wise hearer” will find
sufficient proof of the proposition before him by following the method
of contraries.  For if the difference of language indicates, as we are
told, that the nature has been changed, then let identity of language
compel our adversaries to confess with shame that the essence is
unchanged.

<span id="vii.vi-p56"></span>12.  And it is not only in the case of the
theology that the use of the terms varies, <span
id="fr_776"></span>[777](#fn_776.md) but whenever one of the terms takes
the meaning of the other we find them frequently transferred from the
one subject to the other.  As, for instance, Adam says, “I have gotten a
man *through* God,” <span id="fr_777"></span>[778](#fn_777.md) meaning to
say the same as from God; and in another passage “Moses commanded…Israel
through the word of the Lord,” <span id="fr_778"></span>[779](#fn_778.md)
and, again, “Is not the interpretation through God?” <span
id="fr_779"></span>[780](#fn_779.md)   Joseph, discoursing about dreams to
the prisoners, instead of saying “*from* God” says plainly “*through*
God.”  Inversely Paul uses the term “*from* whom” instead of “*through*
whom,” when he says “made from a woman” (A.V., “of” instead of
“*through* a woman”). <span id="fr_780"></span>[781](#fn_780.md)   And this
he has plainly distinguished in another passage, where he says that it
is proper to a woman to be made of the man, and to a man to be made
through the woman, in the words “For as the woman is from \[A.V., of\]
the man, even so is the man also through \[A.V., by\] the woman.” <span
id="fr_781"></span>[782](#fn_781.md)   Nevertheless in the passage in
question the apostle, while illustrating the variety of usage, at the
same time corrects *obiter* the error of those who supposed that the
body of the Lord was a spiritual body, <span
id="fr_782"></span>[783](#fn_782.md) and, to shew that the
God-bearing <span id="fr_783"></span>[784](#fn_783.md) flesh was formed out
of the com<span id="page_8">p. 8</span> <span
id="vii.vi-Page_8"></span>mon lump <span
id="fr_784"></span>[785](#fn_784.md) of human nature, gave precedence to
the more emphatic preposition.

<span id="vii.vi-p66"></span>The phrase “through a woman” would be
likely to give rise to the suspicion of mere transit in the generation,
while the phrase “of the woman” would satisfactorily indicate that the
nature was shared by the mother and the offspring.  The apostle was in
no wise contradicting himself, but he shewed that the words can without
difficulty be interchanged.  Since, therefore, the term “from whom” is
transferred to the identical subjects in the case of which “through
whom” is decided to be properly used, with what consistency can these
phrases be invariably distinguished one from the other, in order that
fault may be falsely found with true religion?

<span id="vii.vi-p6"></span> If Catholic Theology does not owe to St.
Basil the distinction between the connotations of <span

class="Greek"><span id="vii.vi-p6.2"></span>ὑ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.vi-p6.3"></span>πόστασις</span> which soon
prevailed over the identification obtaining at the time of the Nicene
Council, at all events his is the first and most famous assertion and
defence of it.  At Nicæa, in 325, to have spoken of St. Paul as
“distinguishing the hypostases” would have been held impious.  Some
forty-five years later St. Basil writes to his brother, Gregory of Nyssa
(Ep. xxxviii.<span id="vii.vi-p6.4"></span>), in fear lest Gregory
should fall into the error of failing to distinguish between hypostasis
and ousia, between person and essence.  *cf*. Theodoret Dial. i. 7, and

St. Basil has been accused of quoting from memory.  But in the Greek of
the lxx. the subject to <span class="Greek"><span

construction of the sentence is to refer it to Adam.  In his work adv.

remarks that the French theologian Fronton du Duc (Ducæus) accuses
Theodoret (on Cyril’s Anath. vii.) of misquoting St. Basil as writing
here “God-bearing man” instead of “God bearing flesh,” a term of
different signification and less open as a Nestorian interpretation. 
“God-bearing,” <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.vi-p64.1"></span>θεοφόρος</span>, was an epithet applied to mere
men, as, for instance, St. Ignatius.  So Clement of Alexandria, I.
Strom. p. 318, and Gregory of Nazianzus, Or. xxxvii. p. 609.  St. Basil
does use the expression Jesus Christ <span class="Greek"><span
