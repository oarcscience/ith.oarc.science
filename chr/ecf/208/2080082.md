<span id="ix.x-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.x-p1.1"></span>Letter IX. <span
id="fr_1871"></span>[1872](#fn_1871) </span>

<span id="ix.x-p3"></span>*To Maximus the Philosopher*.

<span id="ix.x-p4"></span>1.  <span class="c14"><span
id="ix.x-p4.1"></span>Speech</span> is really an image of mind:  so I
have learned to know you from your letters, just as the proverb tells us
we may know “the lion from his claws.” <span
id="fr_1872"></span>[1873](#fn_1872)

<span id="ix.x-p6"></span>I am delighted to find that your strong
inclinations lie in the direction of the first and greatest of good
things—love both to God and to your neighbour.  Of the latter I find
proof in your kindness to myself; of the former, in your zeal for
knowledge.  It is well known to every disciple of Christ that in these
two all is contained.

<span id="ix.x-p7"></span>2.  You ask for the writings of
Dionysius; <span id="fr_1873"></span>[1874](#fn_1873) they did indeed
reach me, and a great many they were; but I have not the books with me,
and so have not sent them.  My opinion is, however, as follows.  I do
not admire everything that is written; indeed of some things I totally
disapprove.  For it may be, that of the impiety of which we are now
hearing so much, I mean the Anomœan, it is he, as far as I know, who
first gave men the seeds.  I do not trace his so doing to any mental
depravity, but only to his earnest desire to resist Sabellius.  I often
compare him to a woodman trying to straighten some ill-grown sapling,
pulling so immoderately in the opposite direction as to exceed the mean,
and so dragging the plant awry on the other side.  This is very much
what we find to be the case with Dionysius.  While vehe<span
id="page_123">p. 123</span> <span id="ix.x-Page_123"></span>mently
opposing the impiety of the Libyan, <span
id="fr_1874"></span>[1875](#fn_1874) he is carried away unawares by his
zeal into the opposite error.  It would have been quite sufficient for
him to have pointed out that the Father and the Son are not identical in
substance, <span id="fr_1875"></span>[1876](#fn_1875) and thus to score
against the blasphemer.  But, in order to win an unmistakable and
superabundant victory, he is not satisfied with laying down a difference
of hypostases, but must needs assert also difference of substance,
diminution of power, and variableness of glory.  So he exchanges one
mischief for another, and diverges from the right line of doctrine.  In
his writings he exhibits a miscellaneous inconsistency, and is at one
time to be found disloyal to the homoousion, because of his
opponent <span id="fr_1876"></span>[1877](#fn_1876) who made a bad use
of it to the destruction of the hypostases, and at another admitting it
in his Apology to his namesake. <span
id="fr_1877"></span>[1878](#fn_1877)   Besides this he uttered very
unbecoming words about the Spirit, separating Him from the Godhead, the
object of worship, and assigning Him an inferior rank with created and
subordinate nature.  Such is the man’s character.

<span id="ix.x-p13"></span>3.  If I must give my own view, it is this. 
The phrase “like in essence,” <span id="fr_1878"></span>[1879](#fn_1878)
if it be read with the addition “without any difference,” <span
id="fr_1879"></span>[1880](#fn_1879) I accept as conveying the same
sense as the homoousion, in accordance with the sound meaning of the
homoousion.  Being of this mind the Fathers at Nicæa spoke of the
Only-begotten as “Light of Light,” “Very God of very God,” and so on,
and then consistently added the homoousion.  It is impossible for any
one to entertain the idea of variableness of light in relation to light,
of truth in relation to truth, nor of the essence of the Only begotten
in relation to that of the Father.  If, then, the phrase be accepted in
this sense, I have no objection to it.  But if any one cuts off the
qualification “without any difference” from the word “like,” as was done
at Constantinople, <span id="fr_1880"></span>[1881](#fn_1880) then I
regard the phrase with suspicion, as derogatory to the dignity of the
Only-begotten.  We are frequently accustomed to entertain the idea of
“likeness” in the case of indistinct resemblances, coming anything but
close to the originals.  I am myself for the homoousion, as being less
open to improper interpretation.  But why, my dear sir, should you not
pay me a visit, that we may talk of these high topics face to face,
instead of committing them to lifeless letters,—especially when I have
determined not to publish my views?  And pray do not adopt, to me, the
words of Diogenes to Alexander, that “it is as far from you to me as
from me to you.”  I am almost obliged by ill-health to remain like the
plants, in one place; moreover I hold “the living unknown” <span
id="fr_1881"></span>[1882](#fn_1881) to be one of the chief goods.  You,
I am told, are in good health; you have made yourself a citizen of the
world, and you might consider in coming to see me that you are coming
home.  It is quite right for you, a man of action, to have crowds and
towns in which to show your good deeds.  For me, quiet is the best aid
for the contemplation and mental exercise whereby I cling to God.  This
quiet I cultivate in abundance in my retreat, with the aid of its giver,
God.  Yet if you cannot but court the great, and despise me who lie low
upon the ground, then write, and in this way make my life a happier one.
