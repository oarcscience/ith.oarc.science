<span id="vii.xxxi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vii.xxxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXX.</span>

<span id="vii.xxxi-p2"></span>Exposition of the present state of the
Churches.

<span id="vii.xxxi-p3"></span>76.  <span class="c14"><span
id="vii.xxxi-p3.1"></span>To</span> what then shall I liken our present
condition?  It may be compared, I think, to some naval battle which has
arisen out of time old quarrels, and is fought by men who cherish a
deadly hate against one another, of long experience in naval warfare,
and eager for the fight.  Look, I beg you, at the picture thus raised
before your eyes.  See the rival fleets rushing in dread array to the
attack.  With a burst of uncontrollable fury they engage and fight it
out.  Fancy, if you like, the ships driven to and fro by a raging
tempest, while thick darkness falls from the clouds and blackens all the
scenes so that watchwords are indistinguishable in the confusion, and
all distinction between friend and foe is lost.  To fill up the details
of the imaginary picture, suppose the sea swollen with billows and
whirled up from the deep, while a vehement torrent of rain pours down
from the clouds and the terrible waves rise high.  From every quarter of
heaven the winds beat upon one point, where both the fleets are dashed
one against the other.  Of the combatants some are turning traitors;
some are deserting in the very thick of the fight; some have at one and
the same moment to urge on their boats, all beaten by the gale, and to
advance against their assailants.  Jealousy of authority and the lust of
individual mastery splits the sailors into parties which deal mutual
death to one another.  Think, besides all this, of the confused and
unmeaning roar sounding over all the sea, from howling winds, from
crashing vessels, from boiling surf, from the yells of the combatants as
they express their varying emotions in every kind of noise, so that not
a word from admiral or pilot can be heard.  The disorder and confusion
is tremendous, for the extremity of misfortune, when life is despaired
of, gives men license for every kind of wickedness.  Suppose, too, that
the men are all smitten with the incurable plague of mad love of glory,
so that they do not cease from their struggle each to get the better of
the other, while their ship is actually settling down into the deep.

<span id="vii.xxxi-p4"></span>77.  Turn now I beg you from this
figurative description to the unhappy reality.  Did it not at one
time <span id="fr_1340"></span>[1341](#fn_1340.md) appear that the Arian
schism, after its separation into a sect opposed to the Church of God,
stood itself alone in hostile array?  But when the attitude of our foes
against us was changed from one of long standing and bitter strife to
one of open warfare, then, as is well known, the war was split up in
more ways than I can tell into many subdivisions, so that all men were
stirred to a state of inveterate hatred alike by common party spirit and
individual suspicion. <span id="fr_1341"></span>[1342](#fn_1341.md)   But
what storm at sea was ever so <span id="page_49">p. 49</span> <span
id="vii.xxxi-Page_49"></span>fierce and wild as this tempest of the
Churches?  In it every landmark of the Fathers has been moved; every
foundation, every bulwark of opinion has been shaken:  everything buoyed
up on the unsound is dashed about and shaken down.  We attack one
another.  We are overthrown by one another.  If our enemy is not the
first to strike us, we are wounded by the comrade at our side.  If a
foeman is stricken and falls, his fellow soldier tramples him down. 
There is at least this bond of union between us that we hate our common
foes, but no sooner have the enemy gone by than we find enemies in one
another.  And who could make a complete list of all the wrecks?  Some
have gone to the bottom on the attack of the enemy, some through the
unsuspected treachery of their allies, some from the blundering of their
own officers.  We see, as it were, whole churches, crews and all, dashed
and shattered upon the sunken reefs of disingenuous heresy, while others
of the enemies of the Spirit <span id="fr_1342"></span>[1343](#fn_1342.md)
of Salvation have seized the helm and made shipwreck of the faith. <span
id="fr_1343"></span>[1344](#fn_1343.md)   And then the disturbances wrought
by the princes of the world <span id="fr_1344"></span>[1345](#fn_1344.md)
have caused the downfall of the people with a violence unmatched by that
of hurricane or whirlwind.  The luminaries of the world, which God set
to give light to the souls of the people, have been driven from their
homes, and a darkness verily gloomy and disheartening has settled on the
Churches. <span id="fr_1345"></span>[1346](#fn_1345.md)   The terror of
universal ruin is already imminent, and yet their mutual rivalry is so
unbounded as to blunt all sense of danger.  Individual hatred is of more
importance than the general and common warfare, for men by whom the
immediate gratification of ambition is esteemed more highly than the
rewards that await us in a time to come, prefer the glory of getting the
better of their opponents to securing the common welfare of mankind.  So
all men alike, each as best he can, lift the hand of murder against one
another.  Harsh rises the cry of the combatants encountering one another
in dispute; already all the Church is almost full of the inarticulate
screams, the unintelligible noises, rising from the ceaseless agitations
that divert the right rule of the doctrine of true religion, now in the
direction of excess, now in that of defect.  On the one hand are they
who confound the Persons and are carried away into Judaism; <span
id="fr_1346"></span>[1347](#fn_1346.md) on the other hand are they that,
through the opposition of the natures, pass into heathenism. <span
id="fr_1347"></span>[1348](#fn_1347.md)   Between these opposite parties
inspired Scripture is powerless to mediate; the traditions of the
apostles cannot suggest terms of arbitration.  Plain speaking is fatal
to friendship, and disagreement in opinion all the ground that is wanted
for a quarrel.  No oaths of confederacy are so efficacious in keeping
men true to sedition as their likeness in error.  Every one is a
theologue though he have his soul branded with more spots than can be
counted.  The result is that innovators find a plentiful supply of men
ripe for faction, while self-appointed scions of the house of
place-hunters <span id="fr_1348"></span>[1349](#fn_1348.md) reject the
government <span id="fr_1349"></span>[1350](#fn_1349.md) of the Holy Spirit
and divide the chief dignities of the Churches.  The institutions of the
Gospel have now everywhere been thrown into confusion by want of
discipline; there is an indescribable pushing for the chief places while
every self-advertiser <span id="page_50">p. 50</span> <span
id="vii.xxxi-Page_50"></span>tries to force himself into high office. 
The result of this lust for ordering is that our people are in a state
of wild confusion for lack of being ordered; <span
id="fr_1350"></span>[1351](#fn_1350.md) the exhortations of those in
authority are rendered wholly purposeless and void, because there is not
a man but, out of his ignorant impudence, thinks that it is just as much
his duty to give orders to other people, as it is to obey any one else.

<span id="vii.xxxi-p27"></span>78.  So, since no human voice is strong
enough to be heard in such a disturbance, I reckon silence more
profitable than speech, for if there is any truth in the words of the
Preacher, “The words of wise men are heard in quiet,” <span
id="fr_1351"></span>[1352](#fn_1351.md) in the present condition of things
any discussion of them must be anything but becoming.  I am moreover
restrained by the Prophet’s saying, “Therefore the prudent shall keep
silence in that time, for it is an evil time,” <span
id="fr_1352"></span>[1353](#fn_1352.md) a time when some trip up their
neighbours’ heels, some stamp on a man when he is down, and others clap
their hands with joy, but there is not one to feel for the fallen and
hold out a helping hand, although according to the ancient law he is not
uncondemned, who passes by even his enemy’s beast of burden fallen under
his load. <span id="fr_1353"></span>[1354](#fn_1353.md)   This is not the
state of things now.  Why not?  The love of many has waxed cold; <span
id="fr_1354"></span>[1355](#fn_1354.md) brotherly concord is destroyed, the
very name of unity is ignored, brotherly admonitions are heard no more,
nowhere is there Christian pity, nowhere falls the tear of sympathy. 
Now there is no one to receive “the weak in faith,” <span
id="fr_1355"></span>[1356](#fn_1355.md) but mutual hatred has blazed so
high among fellow clansmen that they are more delighted at a neighbour’s
fall than at their own success.  Just as in a plague, men of the most
regular lives suffer from the same sickness as the rest, because they
catch the disease by communication with the infected, so nowadays by the
evil rivalry which possesses our souls we are carried away to an
emulation in wickedness, and are all of us each as bad as the others. 
Hence merciless and sour sit the judges of the erring; unfeeling and
hostile are the critics of the well disposed.  And to such a depth is
this evil rooted among us that we have become more brutish than the
brutes; they do at least herd with their fellows, but our most savage
warfare is with our own people.

<span id="vii.xxxi-p33"></span>79.  For all these reasons I ought to
have kept silence, but I was drawn in the other direction by love, which
“seeketh not her own,” <span id="fr_1356"></span>[1357](#fn_1356.md) and
desires to overcome every difficulty put in her way by time and
circumstance.  I was taught too by the children at Babylon, <span
id="fr_1357"></span>[1358](#fn_1357.md) that, when there is no one to
support the cause of true religion, we ought alone and all unaided to do
our duty.  They from out of the midst of the flame lifted up their
voices in hymns and praise to God, reeking not of the host that set the
truth at naught, but sufficient, three only that they were, with one
another.  Wherefore we too are undismayed at the cloud of our enemies,
and, resting our hope on the aid of the Spirit, have, with all boldness,
proclaimed the truth.  Had I not so done, it would truly have been
terrible that the blasphemers of the Spirit should so easily be
emboldened in their attack upon true religion, and that we, with so
mighty an ally and supporter at our side, should shrink from the service
of that doctrine, which by the tradition of the Fathers has been
preserved by an unbroken sequence of memory to our own day.  A further
powerful incentive to my undertaking was the warm fervour of your “love
unfeigned,” <span id="fr_1358"></span>[1359](#fn_1358.md) and the
seriousness and taciturnity of your disposition; a guarantee that you
would not publish what I was about to say to all the world,—not because
it would not be worth making known, but to avoid casting pearls before
swine. <span id="fr_1359"></span>[1360](#fn_1359.md)   My task is now
done.  If you find what I have said satisfactory, let this make an end
to our discussion of these matters.  If you think any point requires
further elucidation, pray do not hesitate to pursue the investigation
with all diligence, and to add to your information by putting any
uncontroversial question.  Either through me or through others the Lord
will grant full explanation on matters which have yet to be made clear,
according to the knowledge supplied to the worthy by the Holy Spirit. 
Amen.

<span id="fn_1340"></span>[48:1341](2080060.htm#fr_1340.md) <span
id="vii.xxxi-p4.1"></span>

<span id="vii.xxxi-p5"></span> *i.e*. after the condemnation of Arius at
Nicæa.

<span id="fn_1341"></span>[48:1342](2080060.htm#fr_1341.md) <span
id="vii.xxxi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="vii.xxxi-p6"></span> In Ep. ccxlii.<span
id="vii.xxxi-p6.1"></span> written in 376, St. Basil says:  “This is the
thirteenth year since the outbreak of the war of heretics against us.” 
363 is the date of the Acacian Council of Antioch; 364 of the accession
of Valens and Valentian, of the Semi-Arian Synod of Lampsacus, and of
St. Basil’s ordination to the priesthood and book against Eunomius.  On
the propagation by scission and innumerable subdivisions of Arianism
Cannon Bright writes:

<span id="vii.xxxi-p7"></span>The extraordinary versatility, the
argumentative subtlety, and the too frequent profanity of Arianism are
matters of which a few lines can give no idea.  But it is necessary, in
even the briefest notice of this long-lived heresy, to remark on the
contrast between its changeable inventiveness and the simple
steadfastness of Catholic doctrine.  On the one side, some twenty
different creeds (of which several, however, were rather negatively than
positively heterodox) and three main sects, the Semi-Arians, with their
formula of Homoiousion, *i.e.* the Son is like in essence to the Father;
the Acacians, vaguely calling Him like (Homoion); the Aetians, boldly
calling Him unlike, as much as to say He is in no sense Divine.  On the
other side, the Church with the Nicene Creed, confessing Him as
Homoousion, ‘of one essence with the Father,’ meaning thereby, as her
great champion repeatedly bore witness, to secure belief in the reality
of the Divine Sonship, and therefore in the real Deity, as distinguished
from the titular deity which was so freely conceded to Him by the
Arians.”  Cannon Bright, *St. Leo on the Incarnation*, p. 140

<span id="vii.xxxi-p8"></span>Socrates (ii. 41), pausing at 360,
enumerates, after Nicæa:

<span id="vii.xxxi-p9"></span>1.  1st of Antioch (omitted the <span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.xxxi-p9.1"></span>ὁ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.xxxi-p9.2"></span>μοούσιον</span>, <span
class="c14"><span id="vii.xxxi-p9.3"></span>a.d.</span> 341).

<span id="vii.xxxi-p10"></span>2.  2d of Antioch (omitted the <span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.xxxi-p10.1"></span>ὁ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.xxxi-p10.2"></span>μοούσιον</span>, <span
class="c14"><span id="vii.xxxi-p10.3"></span>a.d.</span> 341).

<span id="vii.xxxi-p11"></span>3.  The Creed brought to Constans in Gaul
by Narcissus and other Arians in 342.

<span id="vii.xxxi-p12"></span>4.  The Creed “sent by Eudoxius of
Germanicia into Italy,” *i.e.* the “Macrostich,” or “Lengthy Creed,”
rejected at Milan in 346.

<span id="vii.xxxi-p13"></span>5.  The 1st Creed of Sirmium; *i.e.* the
Macrostich with 26 additional clauses, 351.

<span id="vii.xxxi-p14"></span>6.  The 2d Sirmian Creed.  The
“manifesto;” called by Athanasius (*De Synod*. 28) “the blasphemy,” 357.

<span id="vii.xxxi-p15"></span>7.  The 3d Sirmian, or “dated Creed,” in
the consulship of Flavius Eusebius and Hypatius, May 22d, 359.

<span id="vii.xxxi-p16"></span>8.  The Acacian Creed of Seleucia, 359.

<span id="vii.xxxi-p17"></span>9.  The Creed of Ariminum adopted at
Constantinople, as revised at Nike.

<span id="fn_1342"></span>[49:1343](2080060.htm#fr_1342.md) <span
id="vii.xxxi-p17.1"></span>

<span id="vii.xxxi-p18"></span> On the authority of the <span
class="c14"><span id="vii.xxxi-p18.1"></span>ms.</span> of the tenth
century at Paris, called by the Ben. Editors *Regius Secundus*, they
read for <span class="Greek"><span id="vii.xxxi-p18.2"></span>πνεύματος
πάθους</span>, denying <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xxxi-p18.3"></span>πνευματος</span> to be consistent with the
style and practice of Basil, who they say, never uses the epithet <span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.xxxi-p18.4"></span>σωτήοιος</span> of the
Spirit.  Mr. C.F.H. Johnston notes that St. Basil “always attributes the
saving efficacy of Baptism to the presence of the Spirit, and here
applies the word to Him.”  In § 35, we have <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xxxi-p18.5"></span>τὸ σωτήριον βάπτισυα</span>.

<span id="fn_1343"></span>[49:1344](2080060.htm#fr_1343.md) <span

<span id="vii.xxxi-p21"></span> Among the bishops exiled during the
persecution of Valens were Meletius of Antioch, Eusebius of Samosata,
Pelagius of Laodicea, and Barses of Edessa.  *cf*. Theodoret, *Hist.
Ecc.* iv. 12 *sq.  cf*. Ep. 195<span id="vii.xxxi-p21.1"></span>.

<span id="fn_1346"></span>[49:1347](2080060.htm#fr_1346.md) <span
id="vii.xxxi-p21.2"></span>

<span id="vii.xxxi-p22"></span> The identification of an unsound
Monarchianism with Judaism is illustrated in the *1st Apology of Justin
Martyr, e.g.* in § lxxxiii. (Reeves’ Trans.).  “The Jews, therefore, for
maintaining that it was the Father of the Universe who had the
conference with Moses, when it was the very Son of God who had it, and
who is styled both Angel and Apostle, are justly accused by the
prophetic spirit and Christ Himself, for knowing neither the Father nor
the Son; for they who affirm the Son to be the Father are guilty of not
knowing the Father, and likewise of being ignorant that the Father of
the Universe has a Son, who, being the Logos and First-begotten of God,
is God.”

<span id="fn_1347"></span>[49:1348](2080060.htm#fr_1347.md) <span
id="vii.xxxi-p22.1"></span>

<span id="vii.xxxi-p23"></span> *i.e.* the Arians, whose various
ramifications all originated in a probably well-meant attempt to
reconcile the principles of Christianity with what was best in the old
philosophy, and a failure to see that the ditheism of Arianism was of a
piece with polytheism.
