<span id="ix.lxxxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.lxxxiii-p1.1"></span>Letter LXXXII. <span
id="fr_2280"></span>[2281](#fn_2280.md) </span>

<span id="ix.lxxxiii-p3"></span>*To Athanasius, bishop of Alexandria*.

<span id="ix.lxxxiii-p4"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.lxxxiii-p4.1"></span>When</span> I turn my gaze upon the world,
and perceive the difficulties by which every effort after good is
obstructed, like those of a man walking in fetters, I am brought to
despair of myself.  But then I direct my gaze in the direction of your
reverence; I remember that our Lord has appointed you to be physician of
the diseases in the Churches; and I recover my spirits, and rise from
the depression of despair to the hope of better things.  As your wisdom
well knows, the whole Church is undone.  And you see everything in all
directions in your mind’s eye like a man looking from some tall watch
tower, <span id="fr_2281"></span>[2282](#fn_2281.md) as when at sea many
ships sailing together are all dashed one against the other by the
violence of the waves, and shipwreck arises in some cases from the sea
being furiously agitated from without, in others from the disorder of
the sailors hindering and crowding one another.  It is enough to present
this picture, and to say <span id="page_173">p. 173</span> <span
id="ix.lxxxiii-Page_173"></span>no more. <span
id="fr_2282"></span>[2283](#fn_2282.md)   Your wisdom requires nothing
farther, and the present state of affairs does not allow me freedom of
speech.  What capable pilot can be found in such a storm?  Who is worthy
to rouse the Lord to rebuke the wind and the sea?  Who but he who from
his boyhood <span id="fr_2283"></span>[2284](#fn_2283.md) fought a good
fight on behalf of true religion?  Since now truly all that is sound
among us is moving in the direction of fellowship and unity with those
who are of the same opinion, we have come confidently to implore you to
send us a single letter, advising us what is to be done.  In this way
they wish that they may have a beginning of communication which may
promote unity.  They may, peradventure, be suspected by you, when you
remember the past, and therefore, most God-beloved Father, do as
follows; send me the letters to the bishops, either by the hand of some
one in whom you place trust in Alexandria, or by the hand of our brother
Dorotheus the deacon:  when I have received these letters I will not
deliver them till I have got the bishops’ answers; if not, let me “bear
the blame for ever.” <span id="fr_2284"></span>[2285](#fn_2284.md)   Truly
this ought not to have struck more awe into him who first uttered it to
his father, than into me who now say it to my spiritual father.  If
however you altogether renounce this hope, at least free me from all
blame in acting as I have, for I have undertaken this message and
mediation in all sincerity and simplicity, from desire for peace and the
mutual intercourse of all who think alike about the Lord.

<span id="ix.lxxxiii-p2"></span> Placed at the end of 371 or the
beginning of 372.

<span id="ix.lxxxiii-p5"></span> The fitness of this figure in a letter
to the bishop of Alexandria will not escape notice.  At the eastern
extremity of the island of Pharos still stood the marble lighthouse
erected more than 600 years before by Ptolemy II., and not destroyed
till after the thirteenth century.

<span id="ix.lxxxiii-p6"></span> On Basil’s use of this nautical
metaphor, *cf*. *De Spirtu Sancto*, chap. xxx.  It is of course a
literary commonplace, but Basil’s associations all lay inland.

<span id="ix.lxxxiii-p7"></span> The story of “the boy bishop” will be
remembered, whose serious game of baptism attracted the notice of
Alexander and led to the education of Athanasius in the Episcopal
palace.  Soc., *Ecc. Hist*. i. 15.  Rufinus i. 14.  *cf*. Keble, *Lyra
Innocentium*, “Enacting holy rites.”
