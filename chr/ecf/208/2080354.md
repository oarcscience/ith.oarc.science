<span id="ix.cclxxxii-p4"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cclxxxii-p4.1"></span>I am</span> mindful of the great honour I
received in the encouragement you gave me, along with others, to address
your excellency.  I avail myself of the privilege and the enjoyment of
your gracious favour.

<span id="ix.cclxxxii-p5"></span>I congratulate myself upon having such
a correspondent, as also upon the opportunity afforded your excellency
of conferring an honour on me by your reply.

<span id="ix.cclxxxii-p6"></span>I claim your clemency on behalf of
Helladius my special friend.  I pray that he may be relieved from the
anxieties of Tax-assessor, and so be enabled to work in the interests of
our country.

<span id="ix.cclxxxii-p7"></span>You have already so far given a
gracious consent, that I now repeat my request, and pray you to send
instructions to the governor of the Province, that Helladius may be
released from this infliction.
