<span id="ix.cclxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.cclxiii-p1.1"></span>Letter CCLXII. <span
id="fr_3182"></span>[3183](#fn_3182.md) </span>

<span id="ix.cclxiii-p3"></span>*To the Monk Urbicius.* <span
id="fr_3183"></span>[3184](#fn_3183.md)

<span id="ix.cclxiii-p5"></span>1.  <span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cclxiii-p5.1"></span>You</span> have done well to write to me. 
You have shewn how great is the fruit of charity.  Continue so to do. 
Do not think that, when you write to me, you need offer excuses.  I
recognise my own position, and I know that by nature every man is of
equal honour with the rest.  Whatever excellence there is in me is not
of family, nor of superfluous wealth, nor of physical condition; it
comes only of superiority in the fear of God.  What, then, hinders you
from fearing the Lord yet more, and so, in this respect, being greater
than I am?  Write often to me, and acquaint me with the condition of the
brotherhood with you.  Tell me what members of the Church in your parts
are sound, that I may know to whom I ought to write, and in whom I may
confide.  I am told that there are some who are endeavouring to deprave
the right doctrine of the Lord’s incarnation by perverse opinions, and I
therefore call upon them through you to hold off from those unreasonable
views, which some are reported to me to hold.  I mean that God Himself
was turned into flesh; that He did not assume, through the Holy Mary,
the nature <span id="fr_3184"></span>[3185](#fn_3184.md) of Adam, but, in
His own proper Godhead, was changed into a material nature. <span
id="fr_3185"></span>[3186](#fn_3185.md)

<span id="ix.cclxiii-p8"></span>2.  This absurd position can be easily
confuted.  The blasphemy is its own conviction, and I therefore think
that, for one who fears the Lord, the mere reminder is enough.  If He
was turned, then He was changed.  But far be it from me to say or think
such a thing, when God has declared, “I am the Lord, I change
not.” <span id="fr_3186"></span>[3187](#fn_3186.md)   Moreover, how could
the benefit of the incarnation be conveyed to us, unless our body,
joined to the Godhead, was made superior to the dominion of death?  If
He was changed, He no longer constituted a proper body, such as
subsisted after the combination with it of the divine body. <span
id="fr_3187"></span>[3188](#fn_3187.md)   But how, if all the nature of the
Only-begotten was changed, could the incomprehensible Godhead be
circumscribed within the limit of the mass of a little body?  I am sure
that no one who is in his senses, and has the fear of God, is suffering
from this unsoundness.  But the report has reached me that some of your
company are afflicted with this mental infirmity, and I have therefore
thought it necessary, not to send you a mere formal greeting, but to
include in my letter something which may even build up the souls of them
that fear the Lord.  I therefore urge that these errors receive
ecclesiastical correction, and that you abstain from communion with the
heretics.  I know that we are deprived of our liberty in Christ by
indifference on these points.
