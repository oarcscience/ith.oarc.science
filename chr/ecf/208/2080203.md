<span id="ix.cxxxi-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.cxxxi-p1.1"></span>Letter CXXX. <span
id="fr_2429"></span>[2430](#fn_2429.md) </span>

<span id="ix.cxxxi-p3"></span>*To Theodotus bishop of Nicopolis*.

<span id="ix.cxxxi-p4"></span>1.  <span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cxxxi-p4.1"></span>You</span> have very rightly and properly
blamed me, right honourable and well beloved brother, in that ever since
I departed from your reverence, conveying to Eustathius those
propositions about the faith, I have told you neither much nor little
about his business.  This neglect is really not due to any contempt on
my part for the way in which he has treated me, but simply to the fact
that the story is now published abroad in all men’s ears, and nobody
needs any instructions from me in order to learn what his intentions
are.  For this he has had good heed, as though he were really afraid
that he would have few witnesses of his opinion, and has sent to the
ends of the earth the letter which he has written against me.  He has
therefore severed himself from communion with me.  He did not consent to
meet me at the appointed spot, and did not bring his disciples, as he
had promised.  On the contrary, he publicly stigmatized me in the public
synods, with the Cilician Theophilus, <span
id="fr_2430"></span>[2431](#fn_2430.md) by the open and undisguised slander
of sowing in the souls of the people doctrines at variance with his own
teaching.  This was quite enough to break up all union between us. 
Afterwards he came to Cilicia, and, on meeting with a certain Gelasius,
showed him the creed which only an Arian, or a thorough disciple of
Arius, could subscribe.  Then, indeed, I was yet more confirmed in my
alienation from him.  I felt that the Ethiopian will never change his
skin, nor the leopard his spots, <span
id="fr_2431"></span>[2432](#fn_2431.md) nor a man nurtured in doctrines of
perversity ever be able to rub off the stain of his heresy.

<span id="ix.cxxxi-p7"></span>2.  In addition to all this he has had the
impudence to write against me, or rather to compose long discourses full
of all kinds of abuse and calumny.  To these, up to this time, I have
answered nothing, taught as we are by the Apostle, not to avenge
ourselves, but to give place unto wrath. <span
id="fr_2432"></span>[2433](#fn_2432.md)   Moreover, at the thought of the
depth of the hypocrisy with which he has all along approached me, I
have, in a way, become speechless with amazement.  But, if all this had
never happened, who would not feel horror and detestation of the fellow
at this fresh piece of audacity?  Now, as I hear, if the report is
really true and not a slanderous invention, he has ventured to re-ordain
<span id="page_199">p. 199</span> <span
id="ix.cxxxi-Page_199"></span>certain men; a proceeding on which so far
no heretic has ventured.  How then can I quietly endure such treatment? 
How can I look upon the errors of the man as curable?  Beware, then, of
being led away by lies; do not be moved by the suspicions of men who are
prone to look at everything in a bad light, as though I were making
little of such things.  For, be sure, my very dear and honourable
friend, that I have never at any time been so grieved as I am now, on
hearing of this confusion of the laws of the Church.  Pray only that the
Lord grant me to take no step in anger, but to maintain charity, which
behaveth itself not unseemly and is not puffed up. <span
id="fr_2433"></span>[2434](#fn_2433.md)   Only look how men without charity
have been lifted up beyond all human bounds and conduct themselves in an
unseemly manner, daring deeds which have no precedent in all the
past. <span id="fr_2434"></span>[2435](#fn_2434.md)

letters of Eustathius being guilty of re-ordination.  The Ben. note,
however, states that Basil is not accurate in saying that there was no
heretical precedent for such proceedings.  The Arians are charged with
it in the Book of Prayers of Faustus and Marcellinus, *Bib. Patr.*v.
655.  *cf*. also the letter of Constantius to the Ethiopians against
Frumentius.  Athan., *Apol. ad Const*. § 31.
