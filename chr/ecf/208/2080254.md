<span id="ix.clxxxii-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.clxxxii-p5.1"></span>Your</span> reverence is, I know, no less
distressed than myself at the removal of the very God-beloved bishop
Eusebius.  We both of us need comfort.  Let us try to give it to one
another.  Do you write to me what you hear from Samosata, and I will
report to you anything that I may learn from Thrace. <span
id="fr_2594"></span>[2595](#fn_2594)

<span id="ix.clxxxii-p7"></span>It is to me no slight alleviation of our
present distress to know the constancy of the people.  It will be the
same to you to have news of our common father.  Of course I cannot now
tell you this by letter, but I commend to you one who is fully informed,
and will report to you in what condition he left him, and how he bears
his troubles.  Pray, then, for him and for me that the Lord will grant
him speedy release from his distress.
