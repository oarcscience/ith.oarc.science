<span id="ix.cclxxxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.cclxxxiii-p1.1"></span>Letter CCLXXXII. <span
id="fr_3240"></span>[3241](#fn_3240.md) </span>

<span id="ix.cclxxxiii-p3"></span>To a bishop.

<span id="ix.cclxxxiii-p4"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cclxxxiii-p4.1"></span>You</span> blame me for not inviting you;
and, when invited, you do not attend.  That your former excuse was an
empty one is clear from your conduct on the second occasion.  For had
you been invited before, in all probability you would never have come.

<span id="ix.cclxxxiii-p5"></span>Act not again unadvisedly, but obey
this present invitation; since you know that its repetition strengthens
an indictment, and that a second lends credibility to a previous
accusation.

<span id="ix.cclxxxiii-p6"></span>I exhort you always to bear with me;
or even if you cannot, at any rate it is your duty not to neglect the
Martyrs, to join in whose commemoration you are invited.  Render
therefore your service to us both; or if you will not consent to this,
at any rate to the more worthy.
