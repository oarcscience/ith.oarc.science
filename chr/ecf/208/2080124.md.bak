<span id="ix.lii-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.lii-p1.1"></span>Letter LI. <span
id="fr_2174"></span>[2175](#fn_2174.md) </span>

<span id="ix.lii-p3"></span>*To Bishop Bosporius*. <span
id="fr_2175"></span>[2176](#fn_2175.md)

<span id="ix.lii-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.lii-p5.1"></span>How</span> do you think my heart was pained at
hearing of the slanders heaped on me by some of those that feel no fear
of the Judge, who “shall destroy them that speak leasing”? <span
id="fr_2176"></span>[2177](#fn_2176.md)   I spent nearly the whole night
sleepless, thinking of your words of love; so did grief lay hold upon my
heart of hearts.  For verily, in the words of Solomon, slander humbleth
a man. <span id="fr_2177"></span>[2178](#fn_2177.md)   And no man is so
void of feeling as not to be touched at heart, and bowed down to the
ground, if he falls in with lips prone to lying.  But we must needs put
up with all things and endure all things, after committing our
vindication to the Lord.  He will not despise us; for “he that
oppresseth the poor reproacheth his Maker.” <span
id="fr_2178"></span>[2179](#fn_2178.md)   They, however, who have patched
up this new tragedy of blasphemy seem to have lost all belief in the
Lord, Who has declared that we must give account at the day of judgment
even for an idle word. <span id="fr_2179"></span>[2180](#fn_2179.md)   And
I, tell me, I anathematized the right blessed Dianius?  For this is what
they have said against me.  Where?  When?  In whose presence?  On what
pretext?  In mere spoken words, or in writing?  Following others, or
myself the author and originator of the deed?  Alas for the impudence of
men who make no difficulty at saying anything!  Alas for their contempt
of the judgment of God!  Unless, indeed, they add this further to their
fiction, that they make me out to have been once upon a time so far out
of my mind as not to know what I was saying.  For so long as I have been
in my senses I know that I never did anything of the kind, or had the
least wish to do so.  What I am, indeed, conscious of is this; that from
my earliest childhood I was brought up in love for him, thought as I
gazed at him how venerable he looked, how dignified, how truly
reverend.  Then when I grew older I began to know him by the good
qualities of his soul, and took delight in his society, gradually
learning to perceive the simplicity, nobility, and liberality of his
character, and all his most distinctive qualities, his gentleness of
soul, his mingled magnanimity and meekness, the seemliness of his
conduct, his control of temper, the beaming cheerfulness and affability
which he combined with majesty of demeanour.  From all this I counted
him among men most illustrious for high character.

<span id="ix.lii-p10"></span>However, towards the close of his life (I
will not conceal the truth) I, together with many of them that in our
country <span id="fr_2180"></span>[2181](#fn_2180.md) feared the Lord,
sorrowed over him with sorrow unendurable, because he signed the creed
brought from Constantinople by George. <span
id="fr_2181"></span>[2182](#fn_2181.md)   Afterwards, full of kindness and
gentleness as he was, and willing out of the fulness of his fatherly
heart to give satisfaction to everyone, when he had already fallen sick
of the disease of which he died, he sent for me, and, calling the Lord
to witness, said that in the simplicity of his heart he had agreed to
the document sent from Constantinople, but had had no idea of rejecting
the creed put forth by the holy Fathers at Nicæa, nor had had any other
disposition of heart than from the beginning he had always had.  He
prayed, moreover, that he might not be cut off from the lot of those
<span id="page_155">p. 155</span> <span
id="ix.lii-Page_155"></span>blessed three hundred and eighteen bishops
who had announced the pious decree <span
id="fr_2182"></span>[2183](#fn_2182.md) to the world.  In consequence of
this satisfactory statement I dismissed all anxiety and doubt, and, as
you are aware, communicated with him, and gave over grieving.  Such have
been my relations with Dianius.  If anyone avers that he is privy to any
vile slander on my part against Dianius, do not let him buzz it
slave-wise in a corner; let him come boldly out and convict me in the
light of day.

<span id="ix.lii-p4"></span> Bosporius, an intimate friend of Basil and
of Gregory of Nazianzus, was bishop of Colonia, in Cappadocia Secunda. 
Basil left Cæsarea in 360 in distress at hearing that Dianius had
subscribed the creed of Ariminum, but was hurt at the charge that he had
anathematized his friend and bishop.  Dianius died in Basil’s arms in
362.
