<span id="vi.i.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.i.vii-p1.1"></span>VII.—The Breach with Gregory of
Nazianzus.</span>

<span id="vi.i.vii-p2"></span>Cappadocia, it has been seen, had been
divided into two provinces, and of one of these Tyana had been
constituted the chief town.  Anthimus, bishop of Tyana, now contended
that an ecclesiastical partition should follow the civil, and that Tyana
should enjoy parallel metropolitan privileges to those of Cæsarea.  To
this claim Basil determined to offer an uncompromising resistance, and
summoned Gregory of Nazianzus to his side.  Gregory replied in friendly
and complimentary terms, <span id="fr_186"></span>[187](#fn_186.md) and
pointed out that Basil’s friendship for Eustathius of Sebaste was a
cause of suspicion in the Church.  At the same time he placed himself at
the archbishop’s disposal.  The friends started together with a train of
slaves and mules to collect the produce of the monastery of St. Orestes,
in Cappadocia Secunda, which was the property of the see of Cæsarea. 
Anthimus blocked the defiles with his retainers and in the vicinity of
Sasima <span id="fr_187"></span>[188](#fn_187.md) there was an unseemly
struggle between the domestics of the two prelates. <span
id="fr_188"></span>[189](#fn_188.md)   The friends proceeded to Nazianzus,
and there, with imperious inconsiderateness, Basil insisted upon
nominating Gregory to one of the bishoprics which he was founding in
order to strengthen his position against Anthimus. <span
id="fr_189"></span>[190](#fn_189.md)   For Gregory, the brother, Nyssa was
selected, a town on the Halys, about a hundred miles distant from
Cæsarea, so obscure that Eusebius of Samosata remonstrated with Basil on
the unreasonableness of forcing such a man to undertake the episcopate
of such a place. <span id="fr_190"></span>[191](#fn_190.md)   For Gregory,
the friend, a similar fate was ordered.  The spot chosen was Sasima, a
townlet commanding the scene of the recent fray. <span
id="fr_191"></span>[192](#fn_191.md)   It was an insignificant place at the
bifurcation of the road leading northwards from Tyana to Doara and
diverging westward to Nazianzus. <span id="fr_192"></span>[193](#fn_192.md)
  <span id="page_xxvi">p. xxvi</span> <span
id="vi.i.vii-Page_xxvi"></span>Gregory speaks of it with contempt, and
almost with disgust, <span id="fr_193"></span>[194](#fn_193.md) and never
seems to have forgiven his old friend for forcing him to accept the
responsibility of the episcopate, and in such a place. <span
id="fr_194"></span>[195](#fn_194.md)   Gregory resigned the distasteful
post, <span id="fr_195"></span>[196](#fn_195.md) and with very bitter
feelings.  The utmost that can be said for Basil is that just possibly
he was consulting for the interest of the Church, and meaning to honour
his friend, by placing Gregory in an outpost of peril and difficulty. 
In the kingdom of heaven the place of trial is the place of trust. <span
id="fr_196"></span>[197](#fn_196.md)   But, unfortunately for the
reputation of the archbishop, the war in this case was hardly the Holy
War of truth against error and of right against wrong.  It was a rivalry
between official and official, and it seemed hard to sacrifice Gregory
to a dispute between the claims of the metropolitans of Tyana and
Cæsarea. <span id="fr_197"></span>[198](#fn_197.md)

<span id="vi.i.vii-p34"></span>Gregory the elder joined in persuading
his son.  Basil had his way.  He won a convenient suffragan for the
moment.  But he lost his friend.  The sore was never healed, and even in
the great funeral oration in which Basil’s virtues and abilities are
extolled, Gregory traces the main trouble of his chequered career to
Basil’s unkindness, and owns to feeling the smart still, though the hand
that inflicted the wound was cold. <span
id="fr_198"></span>[199](#fn_198.md)

<span id="vi.i.vii-p38"></span><span id="page_xxvii">p. xxvii</span>
<span id="vi.i.vii-Page_xxvii"></span>With Anthimus peace was ultimately
established.  Basil vehemently desired it. <span
id="fr_199"></span>[200](#fn_199.md)   Eusebius of Samosata again
intervened. <span id="fr_200"></span>[201](#fn_200.md)   Nazianzus remained
for a time subject to Cæsarea, but was eventually recognized as subject
to the Metropolitan of Tyana. <span id="fr_201"></span>[202](#fn_201.md)

<span id="vi.i.vii-p42"></span>The relations, however, between the two
metropolitans remained for some time strained.  When in Armenia in 372,
Basil arranged some differences between the bishops of that district,
and dissipated a cloud of calumny hanging over Cyril, an Armenian
bishop. <span id="fr_202"></span>[203](#fn_202.md)   He also acceded to a
request on the part of the Church of Satala that he would nominate a
bishop for that see, and accordingly appointed Pœmenius, a relation of
his own. <span id="fr_203"></span>[204](#fn_203.md)   Later on a certain
Faustus, on the strength of a recommendation from a pope with whom he
was residing, applied to Basil for consecration to the see, hitherto
occupied by Cyril.  With this request Basil declined to comply, and
required as a necessary preliminary the authorisation of the Armenian
bishops, specially of Theodotus of Nicopolis.  Faustus then betook
himself to Anthimus, and succeeded in obtaining uncanonical consecration
from him.  This was naturally a serious cause of disagreement. <span
id="fr_204"></span>[205](#fn_204.md)   However, by 375, a better feeling
seems to have existed between the rivals.  Basil is able at that date to
speak of Anthimus as in complete agreement with him. <span

of the metropolitan revenues on the ground that it was wrong <span

(*Bibl. Univer*. xviii. p. 60) has condemned Anthimus as an Arian.  He
was undoubtedly <span class="Greek"><span id="vi.i.vii-p6.2"></span>Αρή&
187·ος</span> (Greg. Naz., *Ep*. xlviii.), a devotee of Ares, as he
shewed in the skirmish by Sasima; but there is no reason to suppose him
to have been <span class="Greek"><span

<span id="vi.i.vii-p9"></span> “Nyssa was more clearly than either
Sasima or Doara a part of Cappadocia Secunda; it always retained its
ecclesiastical dependence on Cæsarea, but politically it must have been
subject to Tyana from 372 to 536, and afterwards to Mokissos.  All three
were apparently places to which Basil consecrated bishops during his
contest with Anthimus and the civil power.  His bishop of Nyssa, his own
brother Gregory, was ejected by the dominant Arians, but the eminence
and vigour of Gregory secured his reinstatement and triumphant return. 
Basil’s appointment was thus successful, and the connexion always
continued.  His appointment at Sasima was unsuccessful.  Gregory of
Nazianzus would not maintain the contest, and Sasima passed under the
metropolitan of Tyana.  At Doara, in like fashion, Basil’s nominee was
expelled, and apparently never reinstated.  *Ep*. ccxxxix.  Greg. Naz.

<span id="fn_194"></span>[xxvi:195](2080013.htm#fr_194.md) <span
id="vi.i.vii-p29.1"></span>

<span id="vi.i.vii-p30"></span> It is curious that a place which had so
important a connexion with Gregory the divine should have passed so
completely into oblivion.  From it he derived his episcopal rank.  His
consecration to Sasima was the main ground of the objection of his
opponents at Constantinople in 381 to his occupying the see of the
imperial city.  He was bishop of Sasima, and, by the fifteenth Canon of
Nicæa, could not be transferred to Constantinople.  He never was bishop
of Nazianzus, though he did administer that diocese before the
appointment of Eulalius in 383.  But while the name “Gregory of
Nazianzus” has obscured the very existence of his father, who was really
Gregory of Nazianzus, and is known even to the typical schoolboy,
Gregory has never been described as “Gregory of Sasima.”  “The great
plain which extends from Sasima nearly to Soandos is full of underground
houses and churches, which are said to be of immense extent.  The
inhabitants are described by Leo Diaconus (p. 35) as having been
originally named Troglodytes.…Every house in Hassa Keni has an
underground story cut out of the rock; long narrow passages connect the
underground rooms belonging to each house, and also run from house to
house.  A big solid disc of stone stands in a niche outside each
underground house door, ready to be pulled in front of the door on any
alarm.…Sasima was on the road between Nazianzus and Tyana.  The
distances point certainly to Hassa Keni.…An absolutely unhistorical
legend about St. Makrina is related at Hassa Keni.  Recently a
good-sized church has been built in the village, evidently on the site
of an ancient church; it is dedicated to St. Makrina, who, as the
village priest relates, fled hither from Kaisari to escape marriage, and
to dedicate herself to a saintly life.  The underground cell in which
she lived is below the church.”  Ramsay, *Hist. Geog. of Asia Minor*,
pp. 293, 294.  Paul Lucas identified Sasima with Inschesu.

<span id="fn_195"></span>[xxvi:196](2080013.htm#fr_195.md) <span
id="vi.i.vii-p30.1"></span>

<span id="vi.i.vii-p31"></span> *cf*. Greg. Naz. *Ep*. l.

<span id="fn_196"></span>[xxvi:197](2080013.htm#fr_196.md) <span
id="vi.i.vii-p31.1"></span>

<span id="vi.i.vii-p32"></span> *cf*. De Joinville’s happy illustration
of this in *Histoire du roi Saint Louis*, p. 18. Ed. 1617.  The King of
France would shew more confidence in the captain whom he might choose to
defend La Rochelle, close to the English pale, than in the keeper of
Monthléry, in the heart of the realm.

<span id="fn_197"></span>[xxvi:198](2080013.htm#fr_197.md) <span
id="vi.i.vii-p32.1"></span>

<span id="vi.i.vii-p33"></span> At the same time it is disappointing to
find Gregory mixing up with expressions of reluctance to assume awful
responsibilities, objections on the score of the disagreeable position
of Sasima.  Perhaps something of the sentiments of Basil on this
occasion may be inferred from what he says in *Letter* cii. on the
postponement of private to public considerations in the case of the
appointment of Pœmenius to Satala.

<span id="fn_198"></span>[xxvi:199](2080013.htm#fr_198.md) <span
id="vi.i.vii-p34.1"></span>

<span id="vi.i.vii-p35"></span> *Or*. xliii.  *cf*. Newman, *The Church
of the Fathers*, p. 142, where the breach is impartially commented on: 
“An ascetic, like Gregory, ought not to have complained of the country
as deficient in beauty and interest, even though he might be allowed to
feel the responsibility of a situation which made him a neighbor of
Anthimus.  Yet such was his infirmity; and he repelled the accusations
of his mind against himself by charging Basil with unkindness in placing
him at Sasima.  On the other hand, it is possible that Basil, in his
eagerness for the settlement of his exarchate, too little consulted the
character and taste of Gregory; and, above all, the feelings of duty
which bound him to Nazianzus.…Henceforth no letters, which are
preserved, passed between the two friends; nor are any acts of
intercourse discoverable in their history.  Anthimus appointed a rival
bishop to Sasima; and Gregory, refusing to contest the see with him,
returned to Nazianzus.  Basil laboured by himself.  Gregory retained his
feelings of Basil’s unkindness even after his death.…This lamentable
occurrence took place eight or nine years before Basil’s death; he had,
before and after it, many trials, many sorrows; but this probably was
the greatest of all.”  The statement that no letters which are preserved
passed between the two friends henceforth will have to be modified, if
we suppose *Letter* clxix. to be addressed to Gregory the Divine.  But
Professor Ramsay’s arguments (*Hist. Geog. of Asia Minor*, p. 293) in
favour of Gregory of Nazianzus the elder seem irresistible.

<span id="vi.i.vii-p36"></span>On *Letter* clxix. he writes:  “For
topographical purposes it is necessary to discover who was the Gregory
into whose diocese Glycerius fled.  Tillemont considers that either
Gregory of Nyssa or Gregory of Nazianzus is meant.  But the tone of the
letter is not what we might expect if Basil were writing to either of
them.  It is not conceived in the spirit of authority in which Basil
wrote to his brother or to his friend.  It appears to me to show a
certain deference which, considering the resolute, imperious, and
uncompromising character of Basil (seen especially in his behaviour to
Gregory Nazianzen in the matter of the bishopric of Sasima), I can
explain only on the supposition that he is writing to the aged and
venerable Gregory, bishop of Nazianzos.  Then the whole situation is
clear.  Venasa was in the district of Malakopaia, or Suvermez, towards
the limits of the diocese of Cæsareia.  The adjoining bishopric was that
of Nazianzos.  Venasa being so far from Cæsareia was administered by one
of the fifty *chorepiscopi* whom Basil had under him (Tillemont, *Mem.
p. servir*, etc., ix. p. 120), and the authority of Basil was appealed
to only in the final resort.  Glycerius, when Basil decided against him,
naturally fled over the border into the diocese of Nazianzos.”  (There
is, however, not much reverence in *Letter* clxxi.)

<span id="vi.i.vii-p37"></span>“*Comment l’homme qui avait tant souffert
de l’injustice des autres, put-il être injuste envers son meilleur ami? 
L’amitié est de tous les pays.  Partout, on voit des hommes qui semblent
nés l’un pour l’autre, se rapprocher par une estime mutuelle, par la
conformité de leurs gouts et de leurs caractères partager les peines et
les joies de la vie, et donner le spectacle du plus beau sentiment que
nous avons reçu de la divinité.  Mais la Grèce avait singulièrement
ennobli ce sentiment dejà si pur et si saint, en lui donnant pour but
l’amour de la patrie.  Les amis, destines a se servir l’un à l’autre de
modèle et de soutien, s’aiment moins pour eux-mêmes, que pour rivaliser
de vertu, se dévouer ensemble, s’immoler s’il le faut, au bien
public.…C’est cette amitié de dévouement et de sacrifice, qu’au milieu
de la mollesse du IVme siècle, Basil conçoit pour Grégoire de Nazianze. 
Formée dans les écoles, entretenne par l’amour des lettres, elle avait
pour but unique, non plus la patrie, mais Dieu.  L’amitié de Grégoire et
plus tendre et plus humaine.…Il a voué sa vie à son ami, mais il en
attend la même condescendance, le même denouement à ses propres désirs. 
Basile au contraire, semble prendre à la lettre ce qu’il a lu dans
Plutarque et dans Xénophon de l’amitié antique*.”  E. Fialon, *Et.
Hist*.  In other words, Gregory’s idea of friendship was to sacrifice
one’s self:  Basil’s to sacrifice one’s friend.  This is an interesting
vindication of Basil, but the cause of God was hardly identical with the
humiliation of Anthimus.
