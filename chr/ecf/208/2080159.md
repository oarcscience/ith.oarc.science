<span id="ix.lxxxvii-p3"></span>*To the Governor*. <span

<span id="ix.lxxxvii-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.lxxxvii-p5.1"></span>I know</span> that a first and foremost
object of your excellency is in every way to support the right; and
after that to benefit your friends, and to exert yourself in behalf of
those who have fled to your lordship’s protection.  Both these pleas are
combined in the matter before us.  The cause is right for <span
id="page_175">p. 175</span> <span id="ix.lxxxvii-Page_175"></span>which
we are pleading; it is dear to me who am numbered among your friends; it
is due to those who are invoking the aid of your constancy in their
sufferings.  The corn, which was all my very, dear brother Dorotheus had
for the necessaries of life, has been carried off by some of the
authorities at Berisi, entrusted with the management of affairs, driven
to this violence of their own accord or by others’ instigation.  Either
way it is an indictable offence.  For how does the man whose wickedness
is his own do less wrong than he who is the mere minister of other men’s
wickedness?  To the sufferers the loss is the same.  I implore you,
therefore, that Dorotheus may have his corn returned by the men by whom
he has been robbed, and that they may not be allowed to lay the guilt of
their outrage on other men’s shoulders.  If you grant me my request I
shall reckon the value of the boon conferred by your excellency in
proportion to the necessity of providing one’s self with food.
