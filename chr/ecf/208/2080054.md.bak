<span id="vii.xxv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vii.xxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIV.</span>

<span id="vii.xxv-p2"></span>Proof of the absurdity of the refusal to
glorify the Spirit, from the comparison of things glorified in creation.

<span id="vii.xxv-p3"></span>55.  <span class="c14"><span
id="vii.xxv-p3.1"></span>Furthermore</span> man is “crowned with glory
and honour,” <span id="fr_1187"></span>[1188](#fn_1187.md) and “glory,
honour and peace” are laid up by promise “to every man that worketh
good.” <span id="fr_1188"></span>[1189](#fn_1188.md)   There is moreover a
special and peculiar glory for Israelites “to whom,” it is said
“pertaineth the adoption and the glory…and the service,” <span
id="fr_1189"></span>[1190](#fn_1189.md) and the Psalmist speaks of a
certain glory of his own, “that my glory may sing praise to Thee <span
id="fr_1190"></span>[1191](#fn_1190.md) ;” and again “Awake up my
glory” <span id="fr_1191"></span>[1192](#fn_1191.md) and according to the
Apostle there is a certain glory of sun and moon and stars, <span
id="fr_1192"></span>[1193](#fn_1192.md) and “the ministration of
condemnation is glorious.” <span id="fr_1193"></span>[1194](#fn_1193.md)  
While then so many things are glorified, do you wish the Spirit alone of
all things to be unglorified?  Yet the Apostle says “the ministration of
the Spirit is glorious.” <span id="fr_1194"></span>[1195](#fn_1194.md)  
How then can He Himself be unworthy of glory?  How according to the
Psalmist can the glory of the just man be great <span
id="fr_1195"></span>[1196](#fn_1195.md) and according to you the glory of
the Spirit none?  How is there not a plain peril from such arguments of
our bringing on ourselves the sin from which there is no escape?  If the
man who is being saved by works of righteousness glorifies even them
that fear the Lord <span id="fr_1196"></span>[1197](#fn_1196.md) much less
would he deprive the Spirit of the glory which is His due.

<span id="vii.xxv-p14"></span>Grant, they say, that He is to be
glorified, but not with the Father and the Son.  But what reason is
there in giving up the place appointed by the Lord for the Spirit, and
inventing some other?  What reason is there for robbing of His share of
glory Him Who is everywhere associated with the Godhead; in the
confession of the Faith, in the baptism of redemption, in the working of
miracles, in the indwelling of the saints, in the graces bestowed on
obedience?  For there is not even one single gift which reaches creation
without the Holy Ghost; <span id="fr_1197"></span>[1198](#fn_1197.md) when
not even a single word can be spoken in defence of Christ except by them
that are aided by the Spirit, as we have learnt in the Gospels from our
Lord and Saviour. <span id="fr_1198"></span>[1199](#fn_1198.md)   And I
know not whether any one who has been partaker of the Holy Spirit will
consent that we should overlook all this, forget His fellowship in all
things, and tear the Spirit asunder from the Father and the Son.  Where
then are we to take Him and rank Him?  With the creature?  Yet all the
creature is in bondage, but the Spirit maketh free.  “And where the
Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.” <span
id="fr_1199"></span>[1200](#fn_1199.md)   Many arguments might be adduced
to them that it is unseemly to coordinate the Holy Spirit with created
nature, but for the present I will pass them by.  Were I indeed to bring
forward, in a manner befitting the <span id="page_36">p. 36</span> <span
id="vii.xxv-Page_36"></span>dignity of the discussion, all the proofs
always available on our side, and so overthrow the objections of our
opponents, a lengthy dissertation would be required, and my readers
might be worn out by my prolixity.  I therefore propose to reserve this
matter for a special treatise, <span
id="fr_1200"></span>[1201](#fn_1200.md) and to apply myself to the points
now more immediately before us.

<span id="vii.xxv-p19"></span>56.  Let us then examine the points one by
one.  He is good by nature, in the same way as the Father is good, and
the Son is good; the creature on the other hand shares in goodness by
choosing the good.  He knows “The deep things of God;” <span
id="fr_1201"></span>[1202](#fn_1201.md) the creature receives the
manifestation of ineffable things through the Spirit.  He quickens
together with God, who produces and preserves all things alive, <span
id="fr_1202"></span>[1203](#fn_1202.md) and together with the Son, who
gives life.  “He that raised up Christ from the dead,” it is said,
“shall also quicken your mortal bodies by the spirit that dwelleth in
you;” <span id="fr_1203"></span>[1204](#fn_1203.md) and again “my sheep
hear my voice,…and I give unto them eternal life;” <span
id="fr_1204"></span>[1205](#fn_1204.md) but “the Spirit” also, it is said,
“giveth life,” <span id="fr_1205"></span>[1206](#fn_1205.md) and again “the
Spirit,” it is said, “is life, because of righteousness.” <span
id="fr_1206"></span>[1207](#fn_1206.md)   And the Lord bears witness that
“it is the Spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing.” <span
id="fr_1207"></span>[1208](#fn_1207.md)   How then shall we alienate the
Spirit from His quickening power, and make Him belong to lifeless
nature?  Who is so contentious, who is so utterly without the heavenly
gift, <span id="fr_1208"></span>[1209](#fn_1208.md) and unfed by God’s good
words, who is so devoid of part and lot in eternal hopes, as to sever
the Spirit from the Godhead and rank Him with the creature?

<span id="vii.xxv-p28"></span>57.  Now it is urged that the Spirit is in
us as a gift from God, and that the gift is not reverenced with the same
honour as that which is attributed to the giver.  The Spirit is a gift
of God, but a gift of life, for the law of “the Spirit of life,” it is
said, “hath made” us “free;” <span id="fr_1209"></span>[1210](#fn_1209.md)
and a gift of power, for “ye shall receive power after that the Holy
Ghost is come upon you.” <span id="fr_1210"></span>[1211](#fn_1210.md)   Is
He on this account to be lightly esteemed?  Did not God also bestow His
Son as a free gift to mankind?  “He that spared not His own Son,” it is
said, “but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also
freely give us all things?” <span id="fr_1211"></span>[1212](#fn_1211.md)  
And in another place, “that we might truly know the things that are
freely given us of God,” <span id="fr_1212"></span>[1213](#fn_1212.md) in
reference to the mystery of the Incarnation.  It follows then that the
maintainers of such arguments, in making the greatness of God’s loving
kindness an occasion of blasphemy, have really surpassed the ingratitude
of the Jews.  They find fault with the Spirit because He gives us
freedom to call God our Father.  “For God hath sent forth the Spirit of
His Son into” our “hearts crying Abba, Father,” <span
id="fr_1213"></span>[1214](#fn_1213.md) that the voice of the Spirit may
become the very voice of them that have received him.
