id="ix.cccxxxix-p1.1"></span>Letter CCCXLIV.</span>

<span id="ix.cccxxxix-p2"></span>Basil to Libanius.

<span id="ix.cccxxxix-p3"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cccxxxix-p3.1"></span>I am</span> dissuaded from writing often to
you, learned as you are, by my timidity and my ignorance.  But your
persistent silence is different.  What excuse can be offered for it?  If
any one takes into account that you are slow to write to me, living as
you do in the midst of letters, he will condemn you for forgetfulness of
me.  He who is ready at speaking is not unprepared to write.  And if a
man so endowed is silent, it is plain that he acts either from
forgetfulness or from contempt.  I will, however, requite your silence
with a greeting.  Farewell, most honoured sir.  Write if you like.  If
you prefer it, do not write.
