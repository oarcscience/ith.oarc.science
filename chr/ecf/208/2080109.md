<span id="ix.xxxvii-p4"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.xxxvii-p4.1"></span>It</span> has, I think, been long known to
your excellency that the presbyter of this place is a foster brother of
my own.  What more can I say to induce you in your kindness, to view him
with a friendly eye, and give him help in his affairs?  If you love me,
as I know you do, I am sure that you will endeavour, to the best of your
power, to relieve any one whom I look upon as a second self.  What then
do I ask?  That he do not lose his old rating.  Really he takes no
little trouble in ministering to my necessities, because I, as you know,
have nothing of my own, but depend upon the means of my friends and
relatives.  Look, then, upon my brother’s house as you would on mine, or
let me rather say, on your own.  In return for your kindness to him God
will not cease to help alike yourself, your house, and your family.  Be
sure that I am specially anxious lest any injury should be done to him
by the equalization of rates.
