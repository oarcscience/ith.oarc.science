<span id="ix.cxlvi-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.cxlvi-p1.1"></span>Letter CXLV. <span
id="fr_2476"></span>[2477](#fn_2476.md) </span>

<span id="ix.cxlvi-p3"></span>*To Eusebius, bishop of Samosata*. <span
id="fr_2477"></span>[2478](#fn_2477.md)

<span id="ix.cxlvi-p5"></span>I <span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cxlvi-p5.1"></span>know</span> the countless labours which you
have undergone for the Churches of God; I know your press of occupation,
while you discharge your responsibilities, not as though they were of
mere secondary importance, but in accordance with God’s will.  I know
the man <span id="fr_2478"></span>[2479](#fn_2478.md) who is, as it were,
laying close siege to you and by whom you are forced, like <span
id="page_206">p. 206</span> <span id="ix.cxlvi-Page_206"></span>birds
crouching in cover under an eagle, not to go far from your shelter.  I
know all this.  But longing is strong, both in hoping for the
impracticable and attempting the impossible.  Rather I should say, hope
in God is the strongest of all things. <span
id="fr_2479"></span>[2480](#fn_2479.md)   For it is not from unreasonable
desire, but from strength of faith, that I expect a way out, even from
the greatest difficulties, and that you will find a way to get over all
hindrances, and to come to see the Church that loves you best of all,
and to be seen by her.  What she values most of all good things is to
behold your face and to hear your voice.  Beware then of making her
hopes vain.  When last year, on my return from Syria, I reported the
promise which you had given me, you cannot think how elated with her
hopes I made her.  Do not, my friend, postpone your coming to another
time.  Even if it may be possible for you to see her one day, you may
not see her and me too, for sickness is hurrying me on to quit this
painful life.
