<span id="ix.v-p3"></span>*To Olympius*. <span

<span id="ix.v-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.v-p5.1"></span>What</span> do you mean, my dear Sir, by evicting
from our retreat my dear friend and nurse of philosophy, Poverty?  Were
she but gifted with speech, I take it you would have to appear as
defendant in an action for unlawful ejectment.  She might plead “I chose
to live with this man Basil, an admirer of Zeno, <span
id="fr_1764"></span>[1765](#fn_1764) who, when he had lost everything in
a shipwreck, cried, with great fortitude, ‘well done, Fortune! you are
reducing me to the old cloak;’ <span
id="fr_1765"></span>[1766](#fn_1765) a great admirer of Cleanthes, who
by drawing water from the well got enough to live on and pay his tutors’
fees as well; <span id="fr_1766"></span>[1767](#fn_1766) an immense
admirer of Diogenes, who prided himself on requiring no more than was
absolutely necessary, and flung away his bowl after he had learned from
some lad to stoop down and drink from the hollow of his hand.”  In some
such terms as these you might be chidden by my dear mate Poverty, whom
your presents have driven from house and home.  She might too add a
threat; “if I catch you here again, I shall shew that what went before
was Sicilian or Italian luxury:  so I shall exactly requite you out of
my own store.”

<span id="ix.v-p9"></span>But enough of this.  I am very glad that you
have already begun a course of medicine, and pray that you may be
benefited by it.  A condition of body fit for painless activity would
well become so pious a soul.
