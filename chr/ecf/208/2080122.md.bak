id="ix.l-p1.1"></span>Letter XLIX. <span
id="fr_2168"></span>[2169](#fn_2168.md) </span>

<span id="ix.l-p3"></span>*To Arcadius the Bishop*.

<span id="ix.l-p4"></span>I <span class="c14"><span
id="ix.l-p4.1"></span>thanked</span> the Holy God when I read your
letter, most pious brother.  I pray that I may not be unworthy of the
expectations you have formed of me, and that you will enjoy a full
reward for the honour which you pay me in the name of our Lord Jesus
Christ.  I was exceedingly pleased to hear that you have been occupied
in a matter eminently becoming a Christian, have raised a house to the
glory of God, and have in practical earnest loved, as it is written,
“the beauty of the house of the Lord,” <span
id="fr_2169"></span>[2170](#fn_2169.md) and have so provided for yourself
that heavenly mansion which is prepared in His rest for them that love
the Lord.  If I am able to find any relics of martyrs, I pray that I may
take part in your earnest endeavour.  If “the righteous shall be had in
everlasting remembrance,” <span id="fr_2170"></span>[2171](#fn_2170.md) I
shall without doubt have a share in the good fame which the Holy One
will give you.
