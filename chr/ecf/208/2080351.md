id="ix.cclxxix-p1.1"></span>Letter CCLXXVIII. <span
id="fr_3234"></span>[3235](#fn_3234) </span>

<span id="ix.cclxxix-p3"></span>To Valerianus.

<span id="ix.cclxxix-p4"></span>I <span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cclxxix-p4.1"></span>desired</span>, when in Orphanene, <span
id="fr_3235"></span>[3236](#fn_3235) to see your excellency; I had also
hoped that while you were living at Corsagæna, there would have been
nothing to hinder your coming to me at a synod which I had expected to
hold at Attagæna; since, however, I failed to hold it, my desire was to
see you in the hill-country; for here again Evesus, <span
id="fr_3236"></span>[3237](#fn_3236) being in that neighbourhood, held
out hopes of our meeting.  But since I have been disappointed on both
occasions, I determined to write and beg that you would deign to visit
me; for I think it is but right and proper that the young man should
come to the old.  Furthermore, at our meeting, I would make you a tender
of my advice, touching your negotiations with certain at Cæsarea:  a
right conclusion of the matter calls for my intervention.  If agreeable
then, do not be backward in coming to me.
