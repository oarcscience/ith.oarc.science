id="ix.cxxvii-p1.1"></span>Letter CXXVI. <span

<span id="ix.cxxvii-p3"></span>*To Atarbius*. <span
id="fr_2418"></span>[2419](#fn_2418.md)

<span id="ix.cxxvii-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cxxvii-p5.1"></span>On</span> arriving at Nicopolis in the double
hope of settling the disturbances which had arisen, and applying a
remedy, as far as possible, to measures taken in a disorderly manner and
in violation of the law of the Church, I was exceedingly disappointed at
failing to meet you.  I heard that you had hurriedly withdrawn, and
actually from the very synod which was being held by you.  I am,
therefore, under the necessity of having recourse to writing, and by
this letter I bid you present yourself before me, that you may in person
apply some remedy to the pain which I felt, even unto death, on hearing
that you had ventured on action, in the very middle of the church, of
the like of which I hitherto have never heard.  All this, although
painful and serious, is endurable, as having happened to a man who has
committed the punishment due for his sufferings to God, and is wholly
devoted to peace and to preventing harm falling from any fault of his on
God’s people.  Since, however, some honourable brethren, worthy of all
credit, have told me that you have introduced certain innovations into
the faith, and have spoken against sound doctrine, I am under the
circumstances the more agitated, and above measure anxious, lest, in
addition to the countless wounds which have been inflicted on the Church
by traitors to the truth of the Gospel, yet a further calamity should
spring up in the renewal of the ancient heresy of Sabellius, the enemy
of the Church; for to this the brethren have reported your utterances to
be akin.  I have, therefore, written to charge you not to shrink from
undertaking a short journey to come to me, and, by giving me full
assurance in the matter, at once to alleviate my pangs, and to solace
the Churches of God, which are now pained to a grave, nay an unendurable
extent, at your actions and your reported words.
