Diocese.* <span id="fr_3114"></span>[3115](#fn_3114.md)

<span id="ix.ccliii-p6"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.ccliii-p6.1"></span>The</span> honours of martyrs ought to be
very eagerly coveted by all who rest their hopes on the Lord, and more
especially by you who seek after virtue.  By your disposition towards
the great and good among your fellow servants you are shewing your
affection to our common Lord.  Moreover, a special reason for this is to
be found in the tie, as it were, of blood, which binds the life of exact
discipline to those who have been made perfect through endurance.  Since
then Eupsychius and Damas and their company are most illustrious among
martyrs, and their memory is yearly kept in our city and all the
neighbourhood, the Church, calling on you by my voice, reminds you to
keep up your ancient custom of paying a visit.  A great and good work
lies before you among the people, who desire to be edified by you, and
are anxious for the reward dependent on the honour paid to the martyrs. 
Receive, therefore, my supplications, and consent of your kindness to
give at the cost of small trouble to yourselves a great boon to
me. <span id="fr_3115"></span>[3116](#fn_3115.md)

<span id="ix.ccliii-p4"></span> In the title the word <span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.ccliii-p4.1"></span>διοίκησις</span> is used
in its oldest ecclesiastical sense of a patriarchal jurisdiction
commensurate with the civil diocese, which contained several provinces. 
*cf*. the IXth Canon of Chalcedon, which gives an appeal from the
metropolitan, the head of the province, to the exarch of the “diocese.” 
“The title exarch is here applied to the primate of a group of
provincial churches, as it had been used by Ibas, bishop of Edema, at
his trial in 448; alluding to the ‘Eastern Council’ which had resisted
the council of Ephesus, and condemned Cyril, he said, ‘I followed my
exarch,’ meaning John of Antioch (Mansi vii. 237; compare Evagrius iv.
11, using ‘patriarchs’ and ‘exarchs’ synonymously).  Reference is here
made not to all such prelates, but to the bishops of Ephesus, *Cæsarea
in Cappadocia*, and Heraclea, if, as seems possible, the see of Heraclea
still nominally retained its old relation to the bishop of Thrace.” 
Bright, *Canons of the First Four Gen. Councils*, pp. 156, 157.

Constantine’s thirteen civil divisions.

Eupsychius, a noble bridegroom of Cæsarea, was martyred under Julian for
his share in the demolition of the temple of Fortune.  Soz. v. 11. 
*cf*. Greg. Naz., *Ep. ad Bas*. lviii.  September 7 was the day of the
feast at Cæsarea.
