<span id="ix.xvii-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.xvii-p1.1"></span>Letter XVI. <span
id="fr_1899"></span>[1900](#fn_1899.md) </span>

<span id="ix.xvii-p3"></span>*Against Eunomius the heretic*. <span
id="fr_1900"></span>[1901](#fn_1900.md)

<span id="ix.xvii-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.xvii-p5.1"></span>He</span> who maintains that it is possible to
arrive at the discovery of things actually existing, has no doubt by
some orderly method advanced his intelligence by means of the knowledge
of actually existing things.  It is after first training himself by the
apprehension of small and easily comprehensible objects, that he brings
his apprehensive faculty to bear on what is beyond all intelligence.  He
makes his boast that he has really arrived at the comprehension of
actual existences; let him then explain to us the nature of the least of
visible beings; let him tell us all about the ant.  Does its life depend
on breath and breathing?  Has it a skeleton?  Is its body connected by
sinews and ligaments?  Are its sinews surrounded with muscles and
glands?  Does its marrow go with dorsal vertebræ from brow to tail? 
Does it give impulse to its moving members by the enveloping nervous
membrane?  Has it a liver, with a gall bladder near the liver?  <span
id="page_126">p. 126</span> <span id="ix.xvii-Page_126"></span>Has it
kidneys, heart, arteries, veins, membranes, cartilages?  Is it hairy or
hairless?  Has it an uncloven hoof, or are its feet divided?  How long
does it live?  What is its mode of reproduction?  What is its period of
gestation?  How is it that ants neither all walk nor all fly, but some
belong to creeping things, and some travel through the air?  The man who
glories in his knowledge of the really-existing ought to tell us in the
meanwhile about the nature of the ant.  Next let him give us a similar
physiological account of the power that transcends all human
intelligence.  But if your knowledge has not yet been able to apprehend
the nature of the insignificant ant, how can you boast yourself able to
form a conception of the power of the incomprehensible God? <span

Julian 361–363.

<span id="ix.xvii-p4"></span> Eunomius the Anomœan, bp. of Cyzicus,
against whose *Liber Apologeticus* Basil wrote his counter-work.  The
first appearance of the <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.xvii-p4.1"></span>αἱρετικὸς ἄνθρωπος</span>, the “chooser” of his
own way rather than the common sense of the Church, is in [Tit. iii.
10](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#010.md)<span id="ix.xvii-p4.2"></span>. 
<span class="Greek"><span id="ix.xvii-p4.3"></span>αἱρετίζειν</span> is
a common word in the LXX., but does not occur in [Is. xlii.
1](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001.md)<span id="ix.xvii-p4.4"></span>,
though it is introduced into the quotation in [Matt. xii.
18](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#018.md)<span id="ix.xvii-p4.5"></span>. 
<span class="Greek"><span id="ix.xvii-p4.6"></span>ἅ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.xvii-p4.7"></span>ιρεσις</span> is used six
times by St. Luke for “sect;” twice by St. Paul and once by St. Peter
for “heresy.”  Augustine, *C. Manich.* writes:*  “Qui in ecclesia
Christi morbidum aliquid pravumque quid sapiunt, si, correcti ut sanum
rectumque sapiant, resistunt contumaciter suaque pestifera et mortifera
dogmata emendare nolunt, sed defensare persistunt hæretici sunt*.”

<span id="ix.xvii-p6"></span> As an argument against Eunomius this
Letter has no particular force, inasmuch as a man may be a good divine
though a very poor entomologist, and might tell us all about the ant
without being better able to decide between Basil and Eunomius.  It is
interesting, however, as shewing how far Basil was abreast of the
physiology of his time, and how far that physiology was correct.
