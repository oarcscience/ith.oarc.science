id="ix.xxvii-p1.1"></span>Letter XXVI. <span
id="fr_1987"></span>[1988](#fn_1987) </span>

<span id="ix.xxvii-p3"></span>*To Cæsarius, brother of Gregory*. <span
id="fr_1988"></span>[1989](#fn_1988)

<span id="ix.xxvii-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.xxvii-p5.1"></span>Thanks</span> to God for shewing forth His
wonderful power in your person, and for preserving you to your country
and to us your friends, from so terrible a death.  It remains for us not
to be ungrateful, nor unworthy of so great a kindness, but, to the best
of our ability, to narrate the marvellous works of God, to celebrate by
deed the kindness which we have experienced, and not return thanks by
word only.  We ought to become in very deed what I, grounding my belief
on the miracles wrought in you, am persuaded that you now are.  We
exhort you still more to serve God, ever increasing your fear more and
more, and advancing on to perfection, that we may be made wise stewards
of our life, for which the goodness of God has reserved us.  For if it
is a command to all of us “to yield ourselves unto God as those that are
alive from the dead,” <span id="fr_1989"></span>[1990](#fn_1989) how
much more strongly is not this commanded them who have been lifted up
from the gates of death?  And this, I believe, would be best effected,
did we but desire ever to keep the same mind in which we were at the
moment of our perils.  For, I ween, the vanity of our life came before
us, and we felt that all that belongs to man, exposed as it is to
vicissitudes, has about it nothing sure, nothing firm.  We felt, as was
likely, repentance for the past; and we gave a promise for the future,
if we were saved, to serve God and give careful heed to ourselves.  If
the imminent peril of death gave me any cause for reflection, I think
that you must have been moved by the same or nearly the same thoughts. 
We are therefore bound to pay a binding debt, at once joyous at God’s
good gift to us, and, at the same time, anxious about the future.  I
have ventured to make these suggestions to you.  It is yours to receive
what I say well and kindly, as you were wont to do when we talked
together face to face.

<span id="ix.xxvii-p4"></span> Cæsarius was the youngest brother of
Gregory of Nazianzus.  After a life of distinguished service under
Julian, Valens, and Valentinian, he was led, shortly after the escape
narrated in this letter, to retire from the world.  A work entitled
<span class="Greek"><span id="ix.xxvii-p4.1"></span>Πύστεις</span>, or
*<span class="Greek"><span id="ix.xxvii-p4.2"></span>Quæstiones</span>*
<span class="Greek"><span id="ix.xxvii-p4.3"></span>(*sive Dialogi*) *de
Rebus Divinus*</span>, attributed to him, is of doubtful genuineness. 
*Vide D.C.B. s.v*.  The earthquake, from the effects of which Cæsarius
was preserved, took place on the tenth of October, 368.  *cf*. Greg.
