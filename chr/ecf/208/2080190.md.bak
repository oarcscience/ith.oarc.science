<span id="ix.cxviii-p4"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cxviii-p4.1"></span>For</span> many reasons I know that I am a
debtor to your reverence, and now the anxiety in which I find myself
necessarily puts me in the way of services of this kind, although my
advisers are mere chance comers, and not like yourself joined to me by
many and different ties.  There is no need to bring the past under
review.  I may say that I was the cause of my own difficulties, by
determining to leave that good discipline which alone leads to
salvation.  The result was that in this trouble I soon fell into
temptation.  What happened has seemed worthy of mention, so that I may
not again fall into similar distress.  As to the future, I wish to give
full assurance to your reverence, that, by God’s grace, all will go
well, since the proceeding is lawful, and there is no difficulty about
it, as many of my friends about the court are ready to help me.  I shall
therefore have a petition drawn up, similar to the form presented to the
Vicar; and, if no delay intervene, I shall promptly get my discharge,
and shall be sure to give you relief by sending you the formal
document.  I feel sure that in this my own convictions have more force
than the imperial orders.  If I shew this fixed and firm in the highest
life, by God’s aid the keeping of my chastity will be inviolable and
sure.  I have been pleased to see the brother entrusted to me by you,
and hold him among my intimate friends.  I trust he may prove worthy of
God and of your good word.
