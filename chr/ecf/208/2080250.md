<span id="ix.clxxviii-p3"></span>*To Saphronius the Master*.

<span id="ix.clxxviii-p4"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.clxxviii-p4.1"></span>To</span> reckon up all those who have
received kindness at your excellency’s hand, for my sake, is no easy
task; so many are there whom I feel that I have benefited through your
kind aid, a boon which the Lord has given me to help me in these very
serious times.  Worthiest of all is he who is now introduced to you by
my letter, the reverend brother Eusebius, attacked by a ridiculous
calumny which it depends upon you alone in your uprightness, to
destroy.  I beseech you, therefore, both as respecting the right and as
being humanely disposed, to grant me your accustomed favours, by
adopting the cause of Eusebius as your own, and championing him, and, at
the same time, truth.  It is no small thing that he has the right on his
side; and this, if he be not stricken down by the present crisis, he
will have no difficulty in proving plainly and without possibility of
contradiction.
