<span id="ix.ccxx-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.ccxx-p1.1"></span>Letter CCXIX. <span
id="fr_2861"></span>[2862](#fn_2861) </span>

<span id="ix.ccxx-p3"></span>To the clergy of Samosata.

<span id="ix.ccxx-p4"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.ccxx-p4.1"></span>The</span> Lord ordereth “all things in measure
and weight,” <span id="fr_2862"></span>[2863](#fn_2862) and brings on us
the temptations which do not exceed our power to endure them, <span
id="fr_2863"></span>[2864](#fn_2863) but tests all that fight in the
cause of true religion by affliction, not suffering them to be tempted
above that they are able to bear. <span
id="fr_2864"></span>[2865](#fn_2864)   He gives tears to drink in great
measure <span id="fr_2865"></span>[2866](#fn_2865) to all who ought to
show whether in their affections they are preserving their gratitude to
Him.  Especially in His dispensation concerning you has He shown His
loving-kindness, not suffering such a persecution to be brought on you
by your enemies as might turn some of you aside, or cause you to swerve
from the faith of Christ.  He has matched you with adversaries who are
of small importance and easy to be repelled, and has prepared the prize
for your patience in your victory over them.  But the common enemy of
our life, who, in his wiles, strives against the goodness of God,
because he has seen that, like a strong wall, you are despising attack
from without, has devised, as I hear, that there should arise among
yourselves mutual offences and quarrels.  These indeed, at the outset,
are insignificant and easy of cure; as time goes on, however, they are
increased by contention and are wont to result in irremediable
mischief. <span id="fr_2866"></span>[2867](#fn_2866)   I have,
therefore, undertaken to exhort you by this letter.  Had it been
possible, I would have come myself and supplicated you in person.  But
this is prevented by present circumstances, and so, in lieu of
supplication, I hold out this letter to you, that you may respect my
entreaty, may put a stop to your mutual rivalries, and may soon send me
the good news that all cause of offence among you is at an end.

<span id="ix.ccxx-p12"></span>2.  I am very anxious that you should know
that he is great before God who humbly submits to his neighbour and
submits to charges against himself, without having cause for shame, even
though they are not true, that he may bring the great blessing of peace
upon God’s Church.

<span id="ix.ccxx-p13"></span>I hope that there will arise among you a
friendly rivalry, as to who shall first be worthy of being called God’s
son, after winning this rank for himself because of his being a
peacemaker.  A letter has also been written to you by your very
God-beloved bishop as to the course which you ought to pursue.  He will
write again what it belongs to him to say.  But I too, because of its
having been already allowed me to be near you, cannot disregard your
position.  So on the arrival of the very devout brother Theodorus the
sub-deacon, and his report that your Church is in distress and
disturbance, being deeply grieved and much pained at heart, I could not
endure to keep silence.  I implore you to fling away all controversy
with one another, and to make peace, that you may avoid giving pleasure
to you opponents and destroying the boast of the Church, which is now
noised abroad throughout the world, that you all, as you are ruled by
one soul and heart, so live in one body.  Through your reverences I
salute all the people of God, both those in rank and office and the rest
of the clergy.  I exhort you to keep your old character.  I can ask for
nothing more than this because by the exhibition of your good works you
have anticipated and made impossible any improvement on them.
