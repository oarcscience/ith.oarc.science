id="ix.xxxv-p1.1"></span>Letter XXXIV. <span
id="fr_2014"></span>[2015](#fn_2014) </span>

<span id="ix.xxxv-p3"></span>*To Eusebius, bishop of Samosata*.

<span id="ix.xxxv-p4"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.xxxv-p4.1"></span>How</span> could I be silent at the present
juncture?  And if I cannot be silent, how am I to find utterance
adequate to the circumstances, so as to make my voice not like a mere
groan but rather a lamentation intelligibly indicating the greatness of
the misfort<span id="page_136">p. 136</span> <span
id="ix.xxxv-Page_136"></span>une?  Ah me!  Tarsus is undone. <span
id="fr_2015"></span>[2016](#fn_2015)   This is a trouble grievous to be
borne, but it does not come alone.  It is still harder to think that a
city so placed as to be united with Cilicia, Cappadocia, and Assyria,
should be lightly thrown away by the madness of two or three
individuals, while you are all the while hesitating, settling what to
do, and looking at one another’s faces.  It would have been far better
to do like the doctors.  (I have been so long an invalid that I have no
lack of illustrations of this kind.)  When their patients’ pain becomes
excessive they produce insensibility; so should we pray that our souls
may be made insensible to the pain of our troubles, that we be not put
under unendurable agony.  In these hard straits I do not fail to use one
means of consolation.  I look to your kindness; I try to make my
troubles milder by my thought and recollection of you. <span
id="fr_2016"></span>[2017](#fn_2016)   When the eyes have looked
intently on any brilliant objects it relieves them to turn again to what
is blue and green; the recollection of your kindness and attention has
just the same effect on my soul; it is a mild treatment that takes away
my pain.  I feel this the more when I reflect that you individually have
done all that man could do.  You have satisfactorily shewn us, men, if
we judge things fairly, that the catastrophe is in no way due to you
personally.  The reward which you have won at God’s hand for your zeal
for right is no small one.  May the Lord grant you to me and to His
churches to the improvement of life and the guidance of souls, and may
He once more allow me the privilege of meeting you.

<span id="ix.xxxv-p5"></span> Silvanus, Metropolitan of Tarsus, one of
the best of the Semi-Arians (Ath., *De synod*. 41), died, according to
Tillemont, in 373, according to Maran four years earlier, and was
succeeded by an Arian; but events did not turn out so disastrously as
Basil had anticipated.  The majority of the presbyters were true to the
Catholic cause, and Basil maintained friendship and intercourse with
them.  *cf. Letters* lxvii., cxiii., cxiv.

<span id="ix.xxxv-p6"></span> Basil is supposed to have in the meanwhile
carried out his previously-expressed intention of paying Eusebius a
visit.
