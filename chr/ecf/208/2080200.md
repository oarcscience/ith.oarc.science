id="ix.cxxviii-p1.1"></span>Letter CXXVII. <span
id="fr_2419"></span>[2420](#fn_2419.md) </span>

<span id="ix.cxxviii-p3"></span>*To Eusebius, bishop of Samosata*. <span

<span id="ix.cxxviii-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cxxviii-p5.1"></span>Our</span> merciful God, Who makes comfort
match trouble, and consoles the lowly, lest they be drowned unawares in
exceeding grief, has sent a consolation, equivalent to the troubles I
have suffered in Nicopolis, in seasonably bringing me the God-beloved
bishop Jobinus.  He must tell you himself how very opportune his visit
was.  I shrink from a long letter, and will hold my peace.  And I am the
more inclined to silence, lest I seem as it were to put a mark on men,
who have turned round and begun to show regard to me, by mentioning
their fall.

<span id="ix.cxxviii-p6"></span>God grant that you may come to see me in
my own home, so that I may embrace your reverence and tell you
everything in detail.  For we often find some comfort in telling what is
painful in actual experience.  However, for all that the very godly
bishop has done, fully as far as regards his affection for me, and
preeminently and stoutly as regards the exact observance of the canons,
commend him.  Moreover, thank God that your pupils everywhere exhibit
your reverence’s character.
