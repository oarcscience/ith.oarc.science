<span id="ix.cxlviii-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cxlviii-p5.1"></span>Up</span> to this time I used to think Homer
a fable, when I read the second part of his poem, in which he narrates
the adventures of Ulysses.  But the calamity which has befallen the most
excellent Maximus has led me to look on what I used to think fabulous
and incredible, as exceedingly probable.  Maximus was governor of no
insignificant people, just as Ulysses was chief of the Cephallenians. 
Ulysses had great wealth, and returned stripped of everything.  To such
straits has calamity reduced Maximus, that he may have to present
himself at home in borrowed rags.  And perhaps he has suffered all this
because he has irritated some Læstrygones against him, and has fallen in
with some Scylla, hiding a dog’s fierceness and fury under a woman’s
form.  Since then he has barely been able to swim out of this
inextricable whirlpool.  He supplicates you by my means for humanity’s
sake to grieve for his undeserved misfortunes and not be silent about
his needs, but make them known to the authorities.  He hopes thus that
he may find some aid against the slanders which have been got up against
him:  and if not, that at all events the intention of the enemy who has
shewn such an intoxication of hostility against him may be made public. 
When a man has been wronged it is a considerable comfort to him if the
wickedness of his enemies can be made plain.
