<span id="ix.clxxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.clxxvii-p1.1"></span>Letter CLXXVI. <span
id="fr_2580"></span>[2581](#fn_2580.md) </span>

<span id="ix.clxxvii-p3"></span>*To Amphilochius, Bishop of
Iconium*. <span id="fr_2581"></span>[2582](#fn_2581.md)

<span id="ix.clxxvii-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.clxxvii-p5.1"></span>God</span> grant that when this letter is
put into your hands, it may find you in good health, quite at leisure,
and as you would wish to be.  For then it will not be in vain that I
send you this invitation to be present at our city, to add greater
dignity to the annual festival which it is the custom of our Church to
hold in honour of the martyrs. <span
id="fr_2582"></span>[2583](#fn_2582.md)   For be sure my most honoured and
dear friend, that our people here, though they have had experience of
many, desire no one’s presence so eagerly as they do yours; so
affectionate an impression has your short intercourse with them left
behind.  So, then, that the Lord may be glorified, the people delighted,
the martyrs honoured, and that I in my old age may receive the attention
due to me from my true son, do not refuse to travel to me with all
speed.  I will beg you too to anticipate the day of assembly, that so we
may converse at leisure and may comfort one another by the interchange
of spiritual gifts.  The day is the fifth of September. <span
id="fr_2583"></span>[2584](#fn_2583.md)   Come then three days beforehand
in order that you may also honour with your presence the Church <span
id="fr_2584"></span>[2585](#fn_2584.md) of the Hospital.  May you by <span
id="page_221">p. 221</span> <span id="ix.clxxvii-Page_221"></span>the
grace of the Lord be kept in good health and spirits in the Lord,
praying for me and for the Church of God.

<span id="fn_2580"></span>[220:2581](2080249.htm#fr_2580.md) <span
id="ix.clxxvii-p1.2"></span>

<span id="ix.clxxvii-p2"></span> Placed in 374.

<span id="fn_2581"></span>[220:2582](2080249.htm#fr_2581.md) <span
id="ix.clxxvii-p3.1"></span>

<span id="ix.clxxvii-p4"></span> An invitation to feast of St.
Eupsychius, with a request to arrive three days before the actual day of
the festival, which was observed on the 7th of September.  (*cf. Letter*
c. and note, and the invitation to the Pontic bishops in cclii.)

<span id="fn_2582"></span>[220:2583](2080249.htm#fr_2582.md) <span
id="ix.clxxvii-p5.2"></span>

<span id="ix.clxxvii-p6"></span> *i.e.* Damas and Eupsychius.

<span id="fn_2583"></span>[220:2584](2080249.htm#fr_2583.md) <span
id="ix.clxxvii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="ix.clxxvii-p7"></span> So the date stands in eight <span
class="c14"><span id="ix.clxxvii-p7.1"></span>mss.</span>  However it
arose, 5th is a mistake for 7th, the day of St. Eupsychius in the Greek
Kalendar.

<span id="fn_2584"></span>[220:2585](2080249.htm#fr_2584.md) <span
id="ix.clxxvii-p7.2"></span>

<span id="ix.clxxvii-p8"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.clxxvii-p8.1"></span>Μνήμη</span>.  The Ben. Ed. understand by
this word the church erected by Basil in his hospital (*cf. Letter*
xciv.) at Cæsarea.  In illustration of the use of <span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.clxxvii-p8.2"></span>μνήμη</span> in this
sense Du Cange cites *Act. Conc. Chalced*. i. 144, and explains it as
being equivalent to “*memoria*,” *i.e.* “*ædes sacra in qua extat sancti
alicujus sepulcrum*.”  *cf.* *Nomocan. Photii* v. § 1.  For the similar
use of “*memoria*,” in Latin, *cf*. Aug., *De Civ. Dei.* xxii. 10: 
“*Nos autem martyribus nostris non templa sicut diis sed*memorias*sicut
hominibus mortuis fabricamus*.”
