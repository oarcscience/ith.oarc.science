id="ix.cxxiv-p1.1"></span>Letter CXXIII. <span

<span id="ix.cxxiv-p3"></span>*To Urbicius, the monk*. <span
id="fr_2404"></span>[2405](#fn_2404.md)

<span id="ix.cxxiv-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cxxiv-p5.1"></span>You</span> were to have come to see me (and
the blessing was drawing near) to cool me, aflame in my temptations,
with the tip of your finger.  What then?  My sins stood in the way and
hindered your start, so that I am sick without a remedy.  Just as when
the waves are round us, one sinks and another rises, and another looms
black and dreadful, so of my troubles:  some have ceased, some are with
me, some are before me.  As is generally the case, the one remedy for
these troubles is to yield to the crisis and withdraw from my
persecutors.  Yet come to me, to console, to advise, or even to travel
with me; in any case you will make me better for the mere sight of you. 
Above all, pray, and pray again, that my reason be not whelmed <span
id="page_194">p. 194</span> <span id="ix.cxxiv-Page_194"></span>by the
waves of my troubles; pray that all through I may keep a heart pleasing
to God, that I be not numbered with the wicked servants, who thank a
master when he gives them good, and refuse to submit when he chastises
them by adversity; but let me reap benefit from my very trials, trusting
most in God when I need Him most.
