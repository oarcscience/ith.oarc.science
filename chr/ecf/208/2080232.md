<span id="ix.clx-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.clx-p1.1"></span>Letter CLIX. <span
id="fr_2517"></span>[2518](#fn_2517) </span>

<span id="ix.clx-p3"></span>*To Eupaterius and his daughter*. <span
id="fr_2518"></span>[2519](#fn_2518)

<span id="ix.clx-p5"></span>1.  <span class="c14"><span
id="ix.clx-p5.1"></span>You</span> may well imagine what pleasure the
letter of your excellencies gave me, if only from its very contents. 
What, indeed, could give greater gratification to one who prays ever to
be in communication with them who fear the Lord, and to share their
blessings, than a letter of this kind, wherein questions are asked about
the knowledge of God?  For if, to me, “to live is Christ,” <span
id="fr_2519"></span>[2520](#fn_2519) truly my words ought to be about
Christ, my every thought and deed ought to depend upon His commandments,
and my soul to be fashioned after His.  I rejoice, therefore, at being
asked about such things, and congratulate the askers.  By me, to speak
shortly, the faith of the Fathers assembled at Nicæa is honoured before
all later inventions.  In it the Son is confessed to be con-substantial
with the Father and to be naturally of the same nature with Him who
begat Him, for He was confessed to be Light of Light, God of God, and
Good of Good, and the like.  Both by those holy men the same doctrine
was declared, and by me now who pray that I may walk in their footsteps.

<span id="ix.clx-p7"></span>2.  But since the question now raised by
those who are always endeavouring to introduce novelties, but passed
over in silence by the men of old, because the doctrine was never
gainsaid, has remained without full explanation (I mean that which
concerns the Holy Ghost) I will add a statement on this subject in
conformity with the sense of Scripture.  As we were baptized, so we
profess our belief.  As we profess our belief, so also we offer praise. 
As then baptism has been given us by the Saviour, in the name of the
Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost, so, in accordance with our
baptism, we make the confession of the creed, and our doxology in
accordance with our creed.  We glorify the Holy Ghost together with the
Father and the Son, from the conviction that He is not separated from
the Divine Nature; for that which is foreign by nature does not share in
the same honors.  All who call the Holy Ghost a creature we pity, on the
ground that, by this utterance, they are falling into the unpardonable
sin of blasphemy against Him.  I need use no argument to prove to those
who are even slightly trained in Scripture, that the creature is
separated from the Godhead.  The creature is a slave; but the Spirit
sets free. <span id="fr_2520"></span>[2521](#fn_2520)   The creature
needs life; the Spirit is the Giver of life. <span
id="fr_2521"></span>[2522](#fn_2521)   The creature requires teaching. 
It is the Spirit that teaches. <span
id="fr_2522"></span>[2523](#fn_2522)   The creature is sanctified; it is
the Spirit that sanctifies. <span id="fr_2523"></span>[2524](#fn_2523)  
Whether you name angels, archangels, or all the heavenly powers, they
receive their sanctification through the Spirit, but the Spirit Himself
has His holiness by nature, not received by favour, but essentially His;
whence He has received the distinctive name of Holy.  What then is by
nature holy, as the Father is by nature holy, and the Son by nature
holy, we do not ourselves allow to be separated and severed from the
divine and blessed Trinity, nor accept those who rashly reckon it as
part of creation.  Let this short summary be sufficient for you, my
pious friends.  From little seeds, with the co-operation of the Holy
Ghost, you will reap the fuller crop of piety.  “Give instruction to a
wise man and he will be yet wiser.” <span
id="fr_2524"></span>[2525](#fn_2524)   I will put off fuller
demonstration till we meet.  When we do, it will be possible for me to
answer objections, to give you fuller proofs from Scripture, and to
confirm all the sound rule of faith.  For the present pardon my
brevity.  I should not have written at all had I not thought it a
greater injury to you to refuse your request altogether than to grant it
in part.
