<span id="ix.cxxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.cxxiii-p1.1"></span>Letter CXXII. <span
id="fr_2401"></span>[2402](#fn_2401) </span>

<span id="ix.cxxiii-p3"></span>*To Pœmenius*, <span
id="fr_2402"></span>[2403](#fn_2402) *bishop of Satala*.

<span id="ix.cxxiii-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cxxiii-p5.1"></span>When</span> the Armenians returned by your
way you no doubt asked for a letter from them, and you learnt why I had
not given the letter to them.  If they spoke as truth lovers should, you
forgave me on the spot; if they kept anything back (which I do not
suppose), at all events hear it from me.

<span id="ix.cxxiii-p6"></span>The most illustrious Anthimus, who long
ago made peace with me, when he found an opportunity of satisfying his
own vain gloriousness, and of causing me some vexation, consecrated
Faustus, by his own authority and with his own hand, without waiting for
any election from you, and ridiculing my punctiliousness in such
matters.  Inasmuch, then, as he has confounded ancient order and has
made light of you, for whose election I was waiting, and has acted in a
manner, as I view it, displeasing to God, for these reasons I felt
pained with them, and gave no letter for any of the Armenians, not even
for your reverence.  Faustus I would not even receive into communion,
thereby plainly testifying that, unless he brought me a letter from you,
I should be permanently alienated from him, and should influence those
of the same mind with me to treat him in the same manner.  If there is
any remedy for these things, be sure to write to me yourself, giving
your testimony to him, if you see that his life is good; and exhort the
rest.  If on the other hand the mischief is incurable, let me perfectly
understand it to be so, that I may no longer take them into account;
although really, as they have proved, they have agreed, for the future,
to transfer their communion to Anthimus, in contempt of me and of my
Church, as though my friendship were no longer worth having.
