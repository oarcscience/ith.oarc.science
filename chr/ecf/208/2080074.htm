<p class="c55"><a name="ix.ii-p3"></A><i>To Eustathius the Philosopher.</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1737"></A><A HREF="#fn_1737"><FONT SIZE="1">1738</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p class="c20"><a name="ix.ii-p5"></A><span class="c14"><a name="ix.ii-p5.1"></A>Much</span> distressed as I was by the flouts of what is called fortune, who always seems to be hindering my meeting you, I was wonderfully cheered and comforted by your letter, for I had already been turning over in my mind whether what so many people say is really true, that there is a certain Necessity or Fate which rules all the events of our lives both great and small, and that we human beings have control over nothing; or, that at all events, all human life is driven by a kind of luck.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1738"></A><A HREF="#fn_1738"><FONT SIZE="1">1739</FONT></A>
&#160; You will be very ready to forgive me for these reflexions, when you learn by what causes I was led to make them.</p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="ix.ii-p7"></A>On hearing of your philosophy, I entertained a feeling of contempt for the teachers of Athens, and left it.&#160; The city on the Hellespont I passed by, more unmoved than any Ulysses, passing Sirens&#146; songs.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1739"></A><A HREF="#fn_1739"><FONT SIZE="1">1740</FONT></A>

 I admired; but I hurried on to the capital of all that is best in it.&#160; When I arrived home, and did not find you,&#8212;the prize which I had sought so eagerly,&#8212;there began many and various unexpected hindrances.&#160; First I must miss you because I fell ill; then when you were setting out for the East I could not start with you; then, after endless trouble, I reached Syria, but I missed the philosopher, who had set out for Egypt.&#160; Then I must set out for Egypt, a long and weary way, and even there I did not gain my end.&#160; But so passionate was my longing that I must either set out for Persia, and proceed with you to the farthest lands of barbarism, (you had got there; what an obstinate devil possessed me!) or settle here at Alexandria.&#160; This last I did.&#160; I really think that unless, like some tame beast, I had followed a bough held out <A NAME="page_110"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 110</FONT></A> <a name="ix.ii-Page_110"></A>to me till I was quite worn out, you would have been driven on and on beyond Indian Nyssa,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1741"></A><A HREF="#fn_1741"><FONT SIZE="1">1742</FONT></A>
 or any more remote region, and wandered about out there.&#160; Why say more?</p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="ix.ii-p12"></A>On returning home, I cannot meet you, hindered by lingering ailments.&#160; If these do not get better I shall not be able to meet you even in the winter.&#160; Is not all this, as you yourself say, due to Fate?&#160; Is not this Necessity?&#160; Does not my case nearly outdo poets&#146; tales of Tantalus?&#160; But, as I said, I feel better after getting your letter, and am now no longer of the same mind.&#160; When God gives good things I think we must thank Him, and not be angry with Him while He is controlling their distribution.&#160; So if He grant me to join you, I shall think it best and most delightful; if He put me off, I will gently endure the loss.&#160; For He always rules our lives better than we could choose for ourselves.</p>
