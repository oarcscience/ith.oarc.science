<span id="vii.xxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vii.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXII.</span>

<span id="vii.xxiii-p2"></span>*Establishment of the natural communion
of the Spirit from His being, equally with the Father and the Son,
unapproachable in thought.* <span id="fr_1166"></span>[1167](#fn_1166)

<span id="vii.xxiii-p4"></span>53.  <span class="c14"><span
id="vii.xxiii-p4.1"></span>Moreover</span> the surpassing excellence of
the nature of the Spirit is to be learned not only from His having the
same title as the Father and the Son, and sharing in their operations,
but also from His being, like the Father and the Son, unapproachable in
thought.  For what our Lord says of the Father as being above and beyond
human conception, and what He says of the Son, this same language He
uses also of the Holy Ghost.  “O righteous Father,” He says, “the world
hath not known Thee,” <span id="fr_1167"></span>[1168](#fn_1167) meaning
here by the world not the complex whole compounded of heaven and earth,
but this life of ours subject to death, <span
id="fr_1168"></span>[1169](#fn_1168) and exposed to innumerable
vicissitudes.  And when discoursing of Himself He says, “Yet a little
while and the world seeth me no more, but ye see me;” <span
id="fr_1169"></span>[1170](#fn_1169) again in this passage, applying the
word *world* to those who being bound down by this material and carnal
life, and beholding <span id="fr_1170"></span>[1171](#fn_1170) the truth
by material sight alone, <span id="fr_1171"></span>[1172](#fn_1171) were
ordained, through their unbelief in the resurrection, to see our Lord no
more with the eyes of the heart.  And He said the same concerning the
Spirit.  “The Spirit of truth,” He says, “whom the world cannot receive,
because it seeth Him not, neither knoweth Him:  but ye know Him, for He
dwelleth with you.” <span id="fr_1172"></span>[1173](#fn_1172)   For the
carnal man, who has never trained his mind to contemplation, <span
id="fr_1173"></span>[1174](#fn_1173) but rather keeps it buried deep in
lust of the flesh, <span id="fr_1174"></span>[1175](#fn_1174) as in mud,
is powerless to look up to the spiritual light of the truth.  And so the
world, that is life enslaved by the affections of the flesh, can no more
receive the grace of the Spirit than a weak eye the light of a sunbeam. 
But the Lord, who by His teaching bore witness to purity of life, gives
to His disciples the power of now both beholding and contemplating the
Spirit.  For “now,” He says, “Ye are clean through the word which I have
spoken unto you,” <span id="fr_1175"></span>[1176](#fn_1175) wherefore
“the world cannot receive Him, because it seeth Him not,…but ye know
Him; for he dwelleth with you.” <span
id="fr_1176"></span>[1177](#fn_1176)   And so says Isaiah;—“He that
spread forth the earth and that which cometh out of it; he that giveth
breath unto the people upon it, and Spirit to them that trample on
it” <span id="fr_1177"></span>[1178](#fn_1177) ; for they that trample
down earthly things and rise above them are borne witness to as worthy
of the gift of the Holy Ghost.  What then ought to be thought of Him
whom the world cannot receive, and Whom saints alone can contemplate
through pureness of heart?  What kind of honours can be deemed adequate
to Him?

LXX. <span class="Greek"><span id="vii.xxiii-p19.2"></span>πατοῦσιν

lxx.  The “walk therein” of A.V. would not bear out his meaning.  For
this use of <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xxiii-p19.3"></span>π</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xxiii-p19.4"></span>ατειν</span>, *cf*. Soph., *Ant*. 745. <span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.xxiii-p19.5"></span>οὐ γὰρ σέβεις τιμάς γε
τὰς θεῶν πατῶν</span>.  So in the vulgate we read “*et spiritum
calcantibus eam,*”—*calcare* bearing the sense of “trample on,” as in
Juvenal, *Sat*. x. 86, “*calcemus Cæsaris hostem*.”  The Hebrew bears no
such meaning.
