id="ix.lxix-p1.1"></span>Letter LXVIII. <span
id="fr_2243"></span>[2244](#fn_2243) </span>

<span id="ix.lxix-p3"></span>*To Meletius, bishop of Antioch*.

<span id="ix.lxix-p4"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.lxix-p4.1"></span>I wished</span> to detain the reverend brother
Dorotheus, the deacon, so long at my side, with the object of keeping
him until the end of the negociations, and so by him acquainting your
excellency with every detail.  But day after day went by; the delay was
becoming protracted; now, the moment that some plan, so far as is
possible in my difficulties, has occurred to me concerning the course to
be taken, I send him to approach your holiness, to make a personal
report to you on all the circumstances, and show you my memorandum, to
the end that, if what has occurred to me seems to you to be likely to be
of service, your excellency may urge on its accomplishment.  To be
brief, the opinion has prevailed that it is best for this our brother
Dorotheus to travel to Rome, to move some of the Italians to undertake a
voyage by sea to visit us, that they may avoid all who would put
difficulties in their way.  My reason for this course is that I see that
those, who are all powerful with the Emperor, are neither willing nor
able to make any suggestion to him about the <span id="page_165">p.
165</span> <span id="ix.lxix-Page_165"></span>exiled, but only count it
so much to the good that they see no worse thing befalling the
Churches.  If, then, my plan seems good also to your prudence, you will
be good enough both to indite letters and dictate memoranda as to the
points on which he must enlarge, and as to whom he had better address
himself.  And so that your despatches may have weight and authority, you
will add all those who share your sentiments, even though they are not
on the spot.  Here all is uncertain; Euippius <span
id="fr_2244"></span>[2245](#fn_2244) has arrived, but so far has made no
sign.  However, he and those who think with him from the Armenian
Tetrapolis and Cilicia are threatening a tumultuous meeting.
