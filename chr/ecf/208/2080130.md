id="ix.lviii-p1.1"></span>Letter LVII. <span
id="fr_2207"></span>[2208](#fn_2207.md) </span>

<span id="ix.lviii-p3"></span>*To Meletius, Bishop of Antioch*. <span
id="fr_2208"></span>[2209](#fn_2208.md)

<span id="ix.lviii-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.lviii-p5.1"></span>If</span> your holiness only knew the
greatness of the happiness you cause me whenever you write to me, I know
that you would never have let slip any opportunity of sending me a
letter; nay, you would have written me many letters on each occasion,
knowing the reward that is kept in store by our loving Lord for the
consolation of the afflicted.  Everything here is still in a very
painful condition, and the thought of your holiness is the only thing
that recalls me from my own troubles; a thought made more distinct to me
by my communication with you through that letter of yours which is so
full of wisdom and grace.  When, therefore, I take your letter into my
hand, first of all, I look at its size, and I love it all the more for
being so big; then, as I read it, I rejoice over every word I find in
it; as I draw near the end I begin to feel sad; so good is every word
that I read, in what you write.  The overflowing of a good heart is
good.  Should I, however, be permitted, in answer to your prayers, while
I live on this earth, to meet you face to face, and to enjoy the
profitable instruction of your living voice, or any aids to help me in
the life that now is, or that which is to come, I should count this
indeed the best of blessings, a prelude to the mercy of God.  I should,
ere now, have adhered to this intention, had I not been prevented by
true and loving brothers.  I have told my brother Theophrastus <span
id="fr_2209"></span>[2210](#fn_2209.md) to make a detailed report to you of
matters, as to which I do not commit my intentions to writing.

id="ix.lviii-p1.2"></span>

<span id="ix.lviii-p2"></span> Placed in the year 371.

<span id="fn_2208"></span>[159:2209](2080130.htm#fr_2208.md) <span
id="ix.lviii-p3.1"></span>

<span id="ix.lviii-p4"></span> This letter, the first of six to Meletius
of Antioch, is supposed to be assigned to this date, because of Basil’s
statement that the state of the Church of Cæsarea was still full of pain
to him.  Basil had not yet overcome the opposition of his suffragans, or
won the position secured to him after his famous intercourse with Valens
in 372.  Meletius had now been for seven years exiled from Antioch, and
was suffering for the sake of orthodoxy, while not in full communion
with the Catholics, because of the unhappy Eustathian schism.

<span id="fn_2209"></span>[159:2210](2080130.htm#fr_2209.md) <span
id="ix.lviii-p5.2"></span>

<span id="ix.lviii-p6"></span> This Theophrastus may be identified with
the deacon Theophrastus who died shortly after Easter <span
class="c14"><span id="ix.lviii-p6.1"></span>a.d.</span> 372.  (*cf.
Letter* xcv.)  The secret instructions given him “seem to refer to
Basil’s design for giving peace to the Church, which Basil did not
attempt to carry out before his tranquilization of Cappadocia, but may
have had in mind long before.”  Maran, *Vit. Bas*. chap. xvi.
