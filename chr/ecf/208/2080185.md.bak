<span id="ix.cxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.cxiii-p1.1"></span>Letter CXII. <span
id="fr_2375"></span>[2376](#fn_2375.md) </span>

<span id="ix.cxiii-p3"></span>*To Andronicus, a general*. <span
id="fr_2376"></span>[2377](#fn_2376.md)

<span id="ix.cxiii-p5"></span>1.  <span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cxiii-p5.1"></span>Did</span> but my health allow of my being
able to undertake a journey without difficulty, and of putting up with
the inclemency of the winter, I should, instead of writing, have
travelled to your excellency in person, and this for two reasons.  First
to pay my old debt, for I know that I promised to come to Sebastia and
to have the pleasure of seeing your excellency; I did indeed come, but I
failed to meet you because I arrived a little later than your lordship;
secondly, to be my own ambassador, because I have hitherto shrunk from
sending, from the idea that I am too insignificant to win such a boon,
and at the same time reckoning that no one by merely writing would be so
likely to persuade any one of public or private rank, in behalf of any
one, as by a personal interview, in which one might clear up some points
in the charges, as to others make entreaty, and for others implore
pardon; none of which ends can be easily achieved by a letter.  Now
against all this I can only set one thing, your most excellent self; and
because it will suffice to tell you my mind in the matter, and all that
is wanting you will add of yourself, I have ventured to write as I do.

<span id="ix.cxiii-p6"></span>2.  But you see how from my hesitation,
and because I put off explaining the reasons of my pleading, I write in
roundabout phrase.  This man Domitianus has been an intimate friend of
my own and of my parents from the beginning, and is like a brother to
me.  Why should I not speak the truth?  When I learnt the reasons for
his being in his present troubles, I said that he had only got what he
deserved.  For I hoped that no one who has ever committed any offence be
it small or great, will escape punishment.  But when I saw him living a
life of insecurity and disgrace, and felt that his only hope depends on
your decision, I thought that he had been punished enough; and so I
implore you to be magnanimous and humane in the view you take of his
case.  To have one’s opponents under one’s power is right and proper for
a man of spirit and authority; but to be kind and gentle to <span
id="page_189">p. 189</span> <span id="ix.cxiii-Page_189"></span>the
fallen is the mark of the man supereminent in greatness of soul, and in
inclemency.  So, if you will, it is in your power to exhibit your
magnanimity in the case of the same man, both in punishing him and in
saving him.  Let the fear Domitian has of what he suspects, and of what
he knows he deserves to suffer, be the extent of his chastisement.  I
entreat you to add nothing to his punishment, for consider this:  many
in former times, of whom no record has reached us, have had those who
wronged them in their power.  But those who surpassed their fellows in
philosophy did not persist in their wrath, and of these the memory has
been handed down, immortal through all time.  Let this glory be added to
what history will say of you.  Grant to us, who desire to celebrate your
praises, to be able to go beyond the instances of kindnesses sung of in
days of old.  In this manner Crœsus, it is said, ceased from his wrath
against the slayer of his son, when he gave himself up for
punishment, <span id="fr_2377"></span>[2378](#fn_2377.md) and the great
Cyrus was friendly to this very Crœsus after his victory. <span
id="fr_2378"></span>[2379](#fn_2378.md)   We shall number you with these
and shall proclaim this your glory, with all our power, unless we be
counted too poor heralds of so great a man.

<span id="ix.cxiii-p9"></span>3.  Yet another plea that I ought to urge
is this, that we do not chastise transgressors for what is past and
gone, (for what means can be devised for undoing the past?) but either
that they may be reformed for the future, or may be an example of good
behaviour to others.  Now, no one could say that either of these points
is lacking in the present case; for Domitian will remember what has
happened till the day of his death; and I think that all the rest, with
his example before them, are dead with alarm.  Under these circumstances
any addition which we make to his punishment will only look like a
satisfaction of our own anger.  This I should say is far from being true
in your case.  I could not indeed be induced to speak of such a thing
did I not see that a greater blessing comes to him that gives, than to
him that receives.  Nor will your magnanimity be known only to a few. 
All Cappadocia is looking to see what is to be done, and I pray that
they may be able to number this among the rest of your good deeds.  I
shrink from concluding my letter for fear any omission may be to my
hurt.  But one thing I will add.  Domitian has letters from many, who
plead for him, but he thinks mine the most important of all, because he
has learnt, from whom I know not, that I have influence with your
excellency.  Do not let the hopes he has placed in me be blasted; do not
let me lose my credit among my people here; be entreated, illustrious
sir, and grant my boon.  You have viewed human life as clearly as ever
philosopher viewed it, and you know how goodly is the treasure laid up
for all those who give their help to the needy.
