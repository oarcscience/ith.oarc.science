<span id="ix.i-p2"></span> ————————————

<span id="ix.i-p3"></span>Of Saint Basil the extant letters, according
to popular ascription, number three hundred and sixty-six.  Of these
three hundred and twenty-five, or, according to some, only three hundred
and nineteen are genuine.  They are published in three chronological
divisions, the 1st, (Letters 1–46) comprising those written by Basil
before his elevation to the episcopate; the second (47–291) the Letters
of the Episcopate; the third (292–366) those which have no note of time,
together with some that are of doubtful genuineness, and a few certainly
spurious. <span id="fr_1735"></span>[1736](#fn_1735)   They may be
classified as (a) historical, (b) dogmatic, (c) moral and ascetic, (d)
disciplinary, (e) consolatory, (f) commendatory, and (g) familiar.  In
the historic we have a vivid picture of his age.  The doctrinal are of
special value as expressing and defending the Nicene theology.  The
moral and ascetic indicate the growing importance of the monastic
institution which Athanasius at about the same time was instrumental in
recommending to the Latin Church.  The disciplinary, (notably 188, 199,
and 217), to Amphilochius, illustrate the earlier phases of
ecclesiastical law.  The consolatory, commendatory, and familiar, have
an immediate biographical value as indicating the character and faith of
the writer, and may not be without use alike as models of Christian
feeling and good breeding, and as bringing comfort in trouble to readers
remote in time and place.  The text in the following translation is that
of Migne’s edition, except where it is stated to the contrary.  Of the
inadequacy of the notes to illustrate the letters as they deserve no one
can be more vividly conscious than myself.  But the letters tell their
own story.
