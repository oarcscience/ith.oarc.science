<span id="xi.ii-p2"></span>————————————

<span id="xi.ii-p3"></span>On the passage “Father if it be possible let
this cup pass from me, nevertheless not as I will but as thou wilt:” and
against Marcionists and Manichæans: also, that we ought not to rush into
danger, but to prefer the will of God before every other will.

<span id="xi.ii-p4"></span>1. <span class="c12"><span
id="xi.ii-p4.1"></span>I lately</span> inflicted a severe stroke upon
those who are grasping and wish to overreach others; <span
id="fr_628"></span>[629](#fn_628.md) I did this not in order to wound them
but in order to correct them; not because I hate the men, but because I
detest their wickedness. For so the physician also lances the abscess,
not as making an attack upon the suffering body, but as a means of
contending with the disorder and the wound. Well to-day let us grant
them a little respite, that they may recover from their distress, and
not recoil from the remedy by being perpetually afflicted. Physicians
also act thus; after the use of the knife they apply plasters and drugs,
and let a few days pass whilst they devise things to allay the pain.
Following their example let me today, devising means for them to derive
benefit from my discourse, start a question concerning doctrine,
directing my speech to the words which have been read. For I imagine
that many feel perplexed as to the reason why these words were uttered
by Christ: and it is probable also that any heretics who are present may
pounce upon the words, and thereby upset many of the more simple-minded
brethren.

<span id="xi.ii-p6"></span>In order then to build a wall against their
attack and to relieve those who are in perplexity from bewilderment and
confusion, let us take in hand the words which have been cited, and
dwell upon the passage, and dive into the depths of its meanings. For
reading does not suffice unless knowledge also be added to it. Even as
the eunuch of Candace read, but until one came who instructed him in the
meaning of what he was reading he derived no great benefit from it. In
order therefore that you may not be in the same condition attend to what
is said, exert your understanding, let me have your mind disengaged from
other thoughts, let your eye be quick-sighted, your intention earnest:
let your soul be set free from worldly cares, that we may not sow our
words upon the thorns, or upon the rock, or by the way side, but that we
may till a deep and rich field, and so reap an abundant harvest. For if
you thus attend to what is said you will render my labour lighter and
facilitate the discovery of that which you are seeking.

<span id="xi.ii-p7"></span>What then is the meaning of the passage which
has been read “Father if it be possible let this cup pass from me?” What
does the saying mean? For we ought to unlock the passage by first giving
a clear interpretation of the words. What then does the saying mean?
“Father if it be possible take away the cross.” How sayest thou? is he
ignorant whether this be possible or impossible? Who would venture to
say this? Yet the words are those of one who is ignorant: for the
addition of the word “if,” is indicative of doubt: but as I said we must
not attend to the words merely, but turn our attention to the sense, and
learn the aim of the speaker, and the cause and the occasion, and by
putting all these things together turn out the hidden meaning. The
unspeakable Wisdom then, who knoweth the Father even as the Father
knoweth the Son, how should he have been ignorant of this? <span
id="page_202">p. 202</span> <span id="xi.ii-Page_202"></span>For this
knowledge concerning His passion was not greater than the knowledge
concerning His essential nature, which He alone accurately knew. “For as
the Father knoweth me” He says “even so know I the Father.” <span
id="fr_629"></span>[630](#fn_629.md) And why do I speak of the only
begotten Son of God? For even the prophets appear not to have been
ignorant of this fact, but to have known it clearly, and to have
declared beforehand with much assurance that so it must come to pass,
and would certainly be.

<span id="xi.ii-p9"></span>Hear at least how variously all announce the
cross. First of all the patriarch Jacob: for directing his discourse to
Him he says “Out of a tender shoot didst thou spring up:” <span
id="fr_630"></span>[631](#fn_630.md) by the word shoot signifying the
Virgin and the undefiled nature of Mary. Then indicating the cross he
said “Thou didst lie down and slumber as a lion, and as a lion’s whelp;
who shall raise him up?” <span id="fr_631"></span>[632](#fn_631.md) Here he
called death a slumbering and a sleep, and with death he combined the
resurrection when he said “who shall raise him up?” No one indeed save
he himself—wherefore also Christ said “I have power to lay down my life,
and I have power to take it again,” <span
id="fr_632"></span>[633](#fn_632.md) and again “Destroy this temple and in
three days I will raise it up.” <span id="fr_633"></span>[634](#fn_633.md)
And what is meant by the words “thou didst lie down and slumber as a
lion?” For as the lion is terrible not only when he is awake but even
when he is sleeping, so Christ also not only before the cross but also
on the cross itself and in the very moment of death was terrible, and
wrought at that time great miracles, turning back the light of the sun,
cleaving the rocks, shaking the earth, rending the veil, alarming the
wife of Pilate, convicting Judas of sin, for then he said “I have sinned
in that I have betrayed the innocent blood;” <span
id="fr_634"></span>[635](#fn_634.md) and the wife of Pilate declared “Have
nothing to do with that just man, for I have suffered many things in a
dream because of Him.” <span id="fr_635"></span>[636](#fn_635.md) The
darkness took possession of the earth, and night appeared at midday,
then death was brought to nought, and his tyranny was destroyed: many
bodies at least of the saints which slept arose. These things the
patriarch declaring beforehand, and demonstrating that, even when
crucified, Christ would be terrible, said “thou didst lie down and
slumber as a lion.” He did not say thou shalt slumber but thou didst
slumber, because it would certainly come to pass. For it is the custom
of the prophets in many places to predict things to come as if they were
already past. For just as it is impossible that things which have
happened should not have happened, so is it impossible that this should
not happen, although it be future. On this account they predict things
to come under the semblance of past time, indicating by this means the
impossibility of their failure, the certainty of their coming to pass.
So also spake David, signifying the cross; “They pierced my hands and my
feet.” <span id="fr_636"></span>[637](#fn_636.md) He did not say they
“shall pierce” but “they pierced” “they counted all my bones.” <span
id="fr_637"></span>[638](#fn_637.md) And not only does he say this, but he
also describes the things which were done by the soldiers. “They parted
my garments among themselves, and upon my vesture did they cast
lots.” <span id="fr_638"></span>[639](#fn_638.md) And not only this but he
also relates they gave Him gall to eat, and vinegar to drink. For he
says “they gave me gall for my food, and for my thirst they gave me
vinegar to drink.” <span id="fr_639"></span>[640](#fn_639.md) And again
another one says that they smote him with a spear, for “they shall look
on Him whom they pierced.” <span id="fr_640"></span>[641](#fn_640.md)
Esaias again in another fashion predicting the cross said “He was led as
a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb before his shearer is dumb, so
openeth he not his mouth.” “In his humiliation his judgment was taken
away.” <span id="fr_641"></span>[642](#fn_641.md)

<span id="xi.ii-p22"></span>2. Now observe I pray how each one of these
writers speaks as if concerning things already past, signifying by the
use of this tense the absolute inevitable certainty of the event. So
also David, describing this tribunal, said, “Why did the heathen rage
and the people imagine vain things? The Kings of the earth stood up, and
the rulers were gathered together against the Lord and against his
Christ.” <span id="fr_642"></span>[643](#fn_642.md) And not only does he
mention the trial, and the cross, and the incidents on the cross, but
also him who betrayed him, declaring that he was his familiar companion
and guest. “For,” he saith, “he that eateth bread with me did magnify
his heel against me.” <span id="fr_643"></span>[644](#fn_643.md) Thus also
does he foretell the voice which Christ was to utter on the cross saying
“My God, My God why hast thou forsaken me?” <span
id="fr_644"></span>[645](#fn_644.md) and the burial also does he describe:
“They laid me in the lowest pit, in dark places, and in the shadow of
death.” <span id="fr_645"></span>[646](#fn_645.md) And the resurrection:
“thou shalt not leave my soul in hell, neither shalt thou suffer thy
Holy One to see corruption;” <span id="fr_646"></span>[647](#fn_646.md) and
the ascension: “God has gone up with a merry noise, the Lord with the
sound of the trump.” <span id="fr_647"></span>[648](#fn_647.md) And the
session on the right hand: “The Lord said to my Lord sit thou on my
right hand until I make thy foes thy footstool.” <span
id="fr_648"></span>[649](#fn_648.md) But Esaias also declares the cause;
saying, “for the transgressions of my <span id="page_203">p. 203</span>
<span id="xi.ii-Page_203"></span>people is He brought to death,” <span
id="fr_649"></span>[650](#fn_649.md) and because all have strayed like
sheep, therefore is he sacrificed.” <span
id="fr_650"></span>[651](#fn_650.md) Then also he adds mention of the
result, saying “by his stripes we have all been healed:” <span
id="fr_651"></span>[652](#fn_651.md) and “he hath borne the sins of
many.” <span id="fr_652"></span>[653](#fn_652.md) The prophets then knew
the cross, and the cause of the cross and that which was effected by it,
and the burial and the resurrection, and the ascension, and the
betrayal, and the trial, and described them all with accuracy: and is He
who sent them and commanded them to speak these things ignorant of them
Himself? What reasonable man would say that? Seest thou that we must not
attend merely to the words? For this is not the only perplexing passage,
but what follows is more perplexing. For what does He say? “Father if it
be possible let this cup pass from me.” Here he will be found to speak
not only as if ignorant, but as if deprecating the cross: For this is
what He says. “If it be permissible let me not be subjected to
crucifixion and death.” And yet when Peter, the leader of the apostles,
said this to Him, “Be it far from thee Lord, this shall not happen unto
Thee,” He rebuked him so severely as to say; “get thee behind me Satan,
thou art an offence unto me, for thou savourest not the things which be
of God, but those which be of men:” <span
id="fr_653"></span>[654](#fn_653.md) although a short time before he had
pronounced him blessed. But to escape crucifixion seemed to Him so
monstrous a thing, that him who had received the revelation from the
Father, him whom He had pronounced blessed, him who had received the
keys of Heaven, He called Satan, and an offence, and accused him of not
savouring the things which be of God because he said to Him, “Be it far
from thee Lord, this shall never be unto Thee”—namely crucifixion. He
then who thus vituperated the disciple, and poured such an invective
upon him as actually to call him Satan (after having bestowed such great
praise on him), because he said “avoid crucifixion,” how could He desire
not to be crucified? and how after these things when drawing the picture
of the good shepherd could He declare this to be the special proof of
his virtue, that he should be sacrificed for the sake of the sheep, thus
saying, “I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd layeth down his life
for the sheep?” <span id="fr_654"></span>[655](#fn_654.md) Nor did He even
stop there, but also added, “but he that is an hireling and not the
shepherd seeth the wolf coming and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth.” <span
id="fr_655"></span>[656](#fn_655.md) If then it is the sign of the good
shepherd to sacrifice himself, and of the hireling to be unwilling to
undergo this, how can He who calls Himself the good shepherd beseech
that he may not be sacrificed? And how could He say “I lay down my life
of myself”? For if thou layest down thy life of thyself, how canst thou
beseech another that thou mayest not lay it down? And how is it that
Paul marvels at Him on account of this declaration, saying “Who being in
the form of God counted it not a prize to be on an equality with God,
but emptied Himself taking the form of a servant, being made in the
likeness of men, and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself,
becoming obedient even unto death, yea, the death of the cross.” <span
id="fr_656"></span>[657](#fn_656.md) And He Himself again speaks in this
wise, “For this cause doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life
that I may take it again.” <span id="fr_657"></span>[658](#fn_657.md) For
if He does not desire to lay it down, but deprecates the act, and
beseeches the Father, how is it that He is loved on this account? For
love is of those who are like minded. And how does Paul say again “Love
one another even as Christ also loved us and gave Himself for us?” <span
id="fr_658"></span>[659](#fn_658.md) And Christ Himself when He was about
to be crucified said “Father, the hour has come: glorify thy Son,” <span
id="fr_659"></span>[660](#fn_659.md) speaking of the cross as glory: and
how then does He deprecate it here when He urges it there? For that the
cross is glory listen to what the evangelist says “the Holy Ghost was
not yet given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.” <span
id="fr_660"></span>[661](#fn_660.md) Now the hearing of this expression is
“grace was not yet given because the enmity towards men was not yet
destroyed by reason that the cross had not yet done its work.” For the
cross destroyed the enmity of God towards man, brought about the
reconciliation, made the earth Heaven, associated men with angels,
pulled down the citadel of death, unstrung the force of the devil,
extinguished the power of sin, delivered the world from error, brought
back the truth, expelled the Demons, destroyed temples, overturned
altars, suppressed the sacrificial offering, implanted virtue, founded
the Churches. The cross is the will of the Father, the glory of the Son,
the rejoicing of the Spirit, the boast of Paul, “for,” he says, “God
forbid that I should boast save in the cross of our Lord Jesus
Christ.” <span id="fr_661"></span>[662](#fn_661.md) The cross is that which
is brighter than the sun, more brilliant than the sunbeam: for when the
sun is darkened then the cross shines brightly: and the sun is darkened
not because it is extinguished, but because it is overpowered by the
brilliancy of the cross. The cross has broken our bond, it has made the
prison of death ineffectual, it is the demonstration of the love of God.
“For <span id="page_204">p. 204</span> <span
id="xi.ii-Page_204"></span>God so loved the world that He gave His
only-begotten Son, that every one who believes in Him should not
perish.” <span id="fr_662"></span>[663](#fn_662.md) And again Paul says “If
being enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of His Son.” <span
id="fr_663"></span>[664](#fn_663.md) The cross is the impregnable wall, the
invulnerable shield, the safeguard of the rich, the resource of the
poor, the defence of those who are exposed to snares, the armour of
those who are attacked, the means of suppressing passion, and of
acquiring virtue, the wonderful and marvellous sign. “For this
generation seeketh after a sign: and no sign shall be given it save the
sign of Jonas;” <span id="fr_664"></span>[665](#fn_664.md) and again Paul
says, “for the Jews ask for a sign and the Greeks seek wisdom, but we
preach Christ crucified.” <span id="fr_665"></span>[666](#fn_665.md) The
cross opened Paradise, it brought in the robber, it conducted into the
kingdom of Heaven the race of man which was about to perish, and was not
worthy even of earth. So great are the benefits which have sprung and do
spring from the cross, and yet doth He not desire to be crucified I ask?
Who would venture to say this? And if He did not desire it who compelled
Him, who forced Him to it? and why did He send prophets beforehand
announcing that He would be crucified, if He was not to be, and did not
wish to undergo it? And for what reason does He call the cross a cup, if
He did not desire to be crucified? For that is the word of one who
signifies the desire which he has concerning the act. For as the cup is
sweet to those who are thirsty so also was crucifixion to Him: wherefore
also He said “With desire have I desired to eat this Passover with
you,” <span id="fr_666"></span>[667](#fn_666.md) and this He meant not
absolutely, but relatively, because after that evening the cross was
awaiting Him.

<span id="xi.ii-p48"></span>3. He then who calls the thing glory, and
rebukes the disciple because he was trying to hinder Him, and proves
that what constitutes the good shepherd is his sacrificing himself on
behalf of the sheep, and declares that he earnestly longs for this
thing, and willingly goes to meet it, how is it that He beseeches it may
not come to pass? And if He did not wish it what difficulty was there in
hindering those who came for that purpose? But in fact you behold Him
hastening towards the deed. At least when they came upon Him He said
“Whom seek ye?” and they replied “Jesus.” Then He saith to them “Lo! I
am He: and they went backward and fell to the ground.” <span
id="fr_667"></span>[668](#fn_667.md) Thus having first crippled them and
proved that He was able to escape their hands, He then surrendered
Himself, that thou mightest learn that not by compulsion or force, or
the tyrannical power of those who attacked Him, did He unwillingly
submit to this, but willingly with purpose and desire, preparing for it
a long time before. Therefore also were prophets sent beforehand, and
patriarchs foretold the events, and by means of words and deeds the
cross was prefigured. For the sacrifice of Isaac also signified the
cross to us: wherefore also Christ said “Abraham your father rejoiced to
see my glory and he saw it and was glad.” <span
id="fr_668"></span>[669](#fn_668.md) The patriarch then was glad beholding
the image of the cross, and does He Himself deprecate it? Thus Moses
also prevailed over Amalek when he displayed the figure of the cross:
and one may observe countless things happening in the Old Testament
descriptive by anticipation of the cross. For what reason then was this
the case if He who was to be crucified did not wish it to come to pass?
And the sentence which follows this is yet more perplexing. For having
said “Let this cup pass from me He added “nevertheless not as I will but
as Thou wilt.” <span id="fr_669"></span>[670](#fn_669.md) For herein as far
as the actual expression is concerned we find two wills opposed to one
another: if at least the Father desires Him to be crucified, but He
Himself does not desire it. And yet we everywhere behold Him desiring
and purposing the same things as the Father. For when He says “grant to
them, as I and Thou are one that they also may be one in us,” <span
id="fr_670"></span>[671](#fn_670.md) it is equivalent to saying that the
purpose of the Father and of the Son is one. And when He says “The words
which I speak I speak not myself, but the Father which dwelleth in me,
He doeth these works,” <span id="fr_671"></span>[672](#fn_671.md) He
indicates the same thing. And when He says “I have not come of
myself” <span id="fr_672"></span>[673](#fn_672.md) and “I can of my own
self do nothing” <span id="fr_673"></span>[674](#fn_673.md) he does not say
this as signifying that He has been deprived of authority, either to
speak or to act (away with the thought!), but as desiring to prove the
concord of his purpose, both in words and deeds, and in every kind of
transaction, to be one and the same with the Father, as I have already
frequently demonstrated. For the expression “I speak not of myself” is
not an abrogation of authority but a demonstration of agreement. How
then does He say here “Nevertheless not as I will but as Thou wilt”?
Perhaps I have excited a great conflict in your mind, but be on the
alert: for although many words have been uttered I know well that your
zeal is still fresh: for the discourse is now hastening on to the
solution. Why then has this form of speech been employed? Attend
carefully, The doctrine of the incarnation was very hard to receive. For
the exceeding measure of His lovingkindness and the magnitude of His
con<span id="page_205">p. 205</span> <span
id="xi.ii-Page_205"></span>descension were full of awe, and needed much
preparation to be accepted. For consider what a great thing it was to
hear and to learn that God the ineffable, the incorruptible, the
unintelligible, the invisible, the incomprehensible, in whose hand are
the ends of the earth, <span id="fr_674"></span>[675](#fn_674.md) who
looketh upon the earth, and causeth it to tremble, who toucheth the
mountains, and maketh them smoke, <span
id="fr_675"></span>[676](#fn_675.md) the weight of whose condescension not
even the Cherubim were able to bear but veiled their faces by the
shelter of their wings, that this God who surpasses all understanding,
and baffles all calculation, having passed by angels, archangels, and
all the spiritual powers above, deigned to become man, and to take flesh
formed of earth and clay, and enter the womb of a virgin, and be borne
there the space of nine months, and be nourished with milk, and suffer
all things to which man is liable. Inasmuch then as that which was to
happen was so strange as to be disbelieved by many even when it had
taken place, He first of all sends prophets beforehand, announcing this
very fact. For instance the patriarch predicted it saying “Thou didst
spring from a tender shoot my son: thou didst lie down and slumber as a
lion;” <span id="fr_676"></span>[677](#fn_676.md) and Esaias saying “Behold
the Virgin shall conceive and bear a son and they shall call His name
Emmanuel;” <span id="fr_677"></span>[678](#fn_677.md) and elsewhere again
“We beheld Him as a young child, as a root in a dry ground;” <span
id="fr_678"></span>[679](#fn_678.md) and by the dry ground he means the
virgin’s womb. And again “unto us a child is born, unto us a son is
given,” <span id="fr_679"></span>[680](#fn_679.md) and again “there shall
come forth a rod out of the root of Jesse, and a flower shall spring out
of his root.” <span id="fr_680"></span>[681](#fn_680.md) And Baruch in the
book of Jeremiah says “this is our God: no other shall be reckoned by
the side of Him: He found out every path of knowledge and gave it to
Jacob His servant, and Israel his beloved. After these things also He
appeared upon the earth, and held converse with men.” <span
id="fr_681"></span>[682](#fn_681.md) And David signifying His incarnate
presence said “He shall come down like the rain into a fleece of wool,
and like the drop which distills upon the earth” <span
id="fr_682"></span>[683](#fn_682.md) because He noiselessly and gently
entered into the Virgin’s womb.

<span id="xi.ii-p65"></span>4. But these proofs alone did not suffice,
but even when He had come, lest what had taken place should be deemed an
illusion, He warranted the fact not only by the sight but by duration of
time and by passing through all the phases incident to man. For He did
not enter once for all into a man matured and completely developed, but
into a virgin’s womb, so as to undergo the process of gestation and
birth and suckling and growth, and by the length of the time and the
variety of the stages of growth to give assurance of what had come to
pass. And not even here were the proofs concluded, but even when bearing
about the body of flesh He suffered it to experience the infirmities of
human nature and to be hungry, and thirsty, and to sleep and feel
fatigue; finally also when He came to the cross He suffered it to
undergo the pains of the flesh. For this reason also streams of sweat
flowed down from it and an angel was discovered strengthening it, and He
was sad and down-cast: for before He uttered these words He said “my
soul is troubled, and exceeding sorrowful ever unto death.” <span
id="fr_683"></span>[684](#fn_683.md) If then after all these things have
taken place the wicked mouth of the devil speaking through Marcion of
Pontus, and Valentinus, and Manichæus of Persia and many more heretics,
has attempted to overthrow the doctrine of the Incarnation and has
vented a diabolical utterance declaring that He did not become flesh,
nor was clothed with it, but that this was mere fancy, and illusion, a
piece of acting and pretence, although the sufferings, the death, the
burial, the thirst, cry aloud against this teaching; supposing that none
of these things had happened would not the devil have sown these wicked
doctrines of impiousness much more widely? For this reason, just as He
hungered, as He slept, as He felt fatigue, as He ate and drank, so also
did He deprecate death, thereby manifesting his humanity, and that
infirmity of human nature which does not submit without pain to be torn
from this present life. For had He not uttered any of these things, it
might have been said that if He were a man He ought to have experienced
human feelings. And what are these? in the case of one about to be
crucified, fear and agony, and pain in being torn from present life: for
a sense of the charm which surrounds present things is implanted in
human nature: on this account wishing to prove the reality of the
fleshly clothing, and to give assurance of the incarnation He manifests
the actual feelings of man with full demonstration.

<span id="xi.ii-p67"></span>This is one consideration, but there is
another no less important. And what is this? Christ having come to earth
wished to instruct men in all virtue: now the instructor teaches not
only by word, but also by deed: for this is the teacher’s best method of
teaching. A pilot for instance when he makes the apprentice sit by his
side shows him how he handles the rudder, but he also joins speech to
action, and does not depend upon words alone or example <span
id="page_206">p. 206</span> <span id="xi.ii-Page_206"></span>alone: in
like manner also an architect when he has placed by his side the man who
is intended to learn from him how a wall is constructed, shows him the
way by means of action as well as by means of oral teaching; so also
with the weaver, and embroiderer, and gold refiner, and coppersmith;—and
every kind of art has teachers who instruct both orally and practically.
Inasmuch then as Christ Himself came to instruct us in all virtue, He
both tells us what ought to be done, and does it. “For,” he says, “he
who does and teaches the same shall be called great in the kingdom of
heaven.” <span id="fr_684"></span>[685](#fn_684.md) Now observe; He
commanded men to be lowly-minded, and meek, and He taught this by His
words: but see how He also teaches it by His deeds. For having said
“Blessed are the poor in spirit, blessed are the meek,” <span
id="fr_685"></span>[686](#fn_685.md) He shows how these virtues ought to be
practised. How then did He teach them? He took a towel and girded
Himself and washed the disciples’ feet. <span
id="fr_686"></span>[687](#fn_686.md) What can match this lowliness of mind?
for He teaches this virtue no longer by His words only but also by His
deeds. Again He teaches meekness and forbearance by His acts. How so? He
was struck on the face by the servant of the high priest, and said “If I
have spoken evil bear witness of the evil: but if well why smitest thou
me?” <span id="fr_687"></span>[688](#fn_687.md) He commanded men to pray
for their enemies: this also again He teaches by means of His acts: for
when He had ascended the cross He said “Father forgive them for they
know not what they do.” <span id="fr_688"></span>[689](#fn_688.md) As
therefore He commanded men to pray so does He Himself pray, instructing
thee to do so by his own unflagging utterances of prayer. Again He
commanded us to do good to those who hate us, and to deal fairly with
those who treat us despitefully: <span id="fr_689"></span>[690](#fn_689.md)
and this He did by his own acts: for he cast devils out of the Jews, who
said that He Himself was possessed by a devil, He bestowed benefits on
His persecutors, He fed those who were forming designs against Him, He
conducted into His kingdom those who were desiring to crucify Him. Again
He said to His disciples “Get you no gold nor silver neither brass in
your purses,” <span id="fr_690"></span>[691](#fn_690.md) thus training them
for poverty: and this also He taught by His example, thus saying, “Foxes
have holes, and the birds of the air have nests, but the Son of man hath
not where to lay His head.” <span id="fr_691"></span>[692](#fn_691.md) And
He had neither table nor dwelling nor anything else of that kind: not
because He was at a loss to obtain them, but because He was instructing
men to go in that path. After the same manner then he taught them also
to pray. They said to Him “Teach us to pray.” <span
id="fr_692"></span>[693](#fn_692.md) Therefore also He prays, in order that
they may learn to pray. But it was necessary for them not merely to
learn to pray but also how they ought to pray: for this reason He
delivered to them a prayer in this form: “Our Father which art in Heaven
hallowed be thy name, Thy kingdom come: Thy will be done, as in Heaven,
so on earth. Give us this day our daily bread: and forgive us our debts
as we also forgive our debtors: and lead us not into temptation:” <span
id="fr_693"></span>[694](#fn_693.md) that is into danger, into snares.
Since then He commanded them to pray “lead us not into temptation,” He
instructs them in this very precept by putting it in practice Himself,
saying “Father if it be possible, let this cup pass away from me,” thus
teaching all the saints not to plunge into dangers, not to fling
themselves into them but to wait for their approach, and to exhibit all
possible courage, only not to rush forwards themselves, or to be the
first to advance against terrors. Why so, pray? both to teach us
lowliness of mind, and also to deliver us from the charge of vainglory.
On this account it is said also in this passage that when He had spoken
these words “He went away and prayed:” and after He had prayed He speaks
thus to His disciples “Could ye not watch with me one hour? Watch and
pray that ye enter not into temptation.” <span
id="fr_694"></span>[695](#fn_694.md) Seest thou He not only prays but also
admonishes? “For the Spirit indeed is willing,” He said, “but the flesh
is weak.” <span id="fr_695"></span>[696](#fn_695.md) Now this He said by
way of emptying their soul of vanity, and delivering them from pride,
teaching them self-restraint, training them to practice moderation.
Therefore the prayer which He wished to teach them, He Himself also
offered, speaking after the manner of men, not according to His Godhead
(for the divine nature is impassable) but according to His manhood. And
He prayed as instructing us to pray, and even to seek deliverance from
distress; but, if this be not permitted, then to acquiesce in what seems
good to God. Therefore He said “Nevertheless not as I will but as Thou
wilt:” not because He had one will and the Father another; but in order
that He might instruct men even if they were in distress and trembling,
even if danger came upon them, and they were unwilling to be torn from
present life, nevertheless to postpone their own will to the will of
God: even as Paul also when he had been instructed practically exhibited
both these principles; for he besought that temptations might be removed
from him, thus saying “For this thing I besought the Lord thrice:” <span
id="fr_696"></span>[697](#fn_696.md) and yet since it <span
id="page_207">p. 207</span> <span id="xi.ii-Page_207"></span>did not
please God to remove it, he says “Wherefore I take pleasure in
infirmities, in insults, in persecutions.” <span
id="fr_697"></span>[698](#fn_697.md) But perhaps what I have said is not
quite clear: therefore I will make it clearer. Paul incurred many
dangers and prayed that he might not be exposed to them. Then he heard
Christ saying “my grace is sufficient for thee, for my strength is made
perfect in weakness.” <span id="fr_698"></span>[699](#fn_698.md) As soon
then as he saw what the will of God was, he in future submitted his will
to God’s will. By means of this prayer then Christ taught both these
truths, that we should not plunge into dangers, but rather pray that we
may not fall into them; but if they come upon us we should bear them
bravely, and postpone our own will to the will of God. Knowing these
things then let us pray that we may never enter into temptation: but if
we do enter it let us beseech God to give us patience and courage, and
let us honour His will in preference to every will of our own. For then
we shall pass through this present life with safety, and shall obtain
the blessings to come: which may we all receive by the favour and
lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, with Whom be to the Father,
together with the Holy Ghost, glory, might, honour, now and for ever
world without end. Amen.
