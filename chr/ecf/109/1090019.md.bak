id="iv.ii-p1.1"></span>INTRODUCTION TO THE TREATISE ON THE
PRIESTHOOD.</span>

<span id="iv.ii-p2"></span>The events recorded in this celebrated
treatise on the Priesthood must have occurred when St. John Chrysostom
was about twenty-eight years of age. His father had died when he was a
young child; his mother was a devout Christian, but had not destined him
for the clerical vocation. The great ability which he showed in early
youth seemed to mark him out for distinction in one of the learned
professions, and at the age of eighteen he began to attend the school of
Libanius, the most celebrated sophist of the day, who had won a great
reputation as a professor of philosophy and rhetoric, and as an eloquent
opponent of Christianity, not only in his native city, Antioch, but also
in Athens, Nicomedia, and Constantinople. The artificial character
however of his writings indicates the decadence of literary power; he
could skillfully imitate the style of ancient writers but he could not
inform himself with their spirit; “his productions” says Gibbon \[ch.
xxiv\], “are for the most part the vain and idle composition of an
orator who cultivated the science of words.”

<span id="iv.ii-p3"></span>In the school of Libanius Chrysostom no doubt
studied the best classical Greek authors, and although he retained
little admiration for them in later life and probably read them but
rarely, his tenacious memory enabled him to the last to adorn his
homilies with quotations from Homer, Plato and the Tragedians. In the
school of Libanius also he began to practice his nascent power of
eloquence, and a speech which he made in honor of the Emperors is highly
commended in an extant letter of his master. Thus the Pagan sophist
helped to forge the weapons which were destined to be turned against his
own cause. When he was on his death-bed being asked by his friends who
was most worthy to succeed him, “it would have been John,” he replied,
“if the Christians had not stolen him from us.”

<span id="iv.ii-p4"></span>In due time Chrysostom began to practise as a
lawyer; and as the profession of the law was reckoned one of the surest
avenues to political distinction for a man of talent, and the speeches
of Chrysostom excited great admiration, a brilliant and prosperous
career seemed to lie before him. But the soul of the young advocate had
drunk draughts from a purer well-spring than the school of Libanius
could supply, and like many other Christians in that age when society,
even Christian society, was deeply tainted by Pagan sentiments and
habits of life, especially in a profligate city like Antioch, he
recoiled from the contrast between the morality of the world in which he
lived, and the standard of holiness which was presented in the Gospel.
The chicanery and rapacity also prevalent in the profession which he had
adopted became especially repugnant to his conscience. And these
feelings were strengthened by the influence of his intimate friend Basil
who had been a fellow pupil with him at the school of Libanius.

<span id="iv.ii-p5"></span>The first book of the treatise on the
Priesthood opens with a description of his friendship with Basil; how
they studied the same subjects together under the same teachers, and how
entirely harmonious they were in all their tastes, and inclinations \[ci
and ii.\] Nevertheless when Basil decided to follow what Chrysostom
calls the “true philosophy,” by which he means a life of religious
seclusion and study, Chrysostom could not immediately make up his mind
to follow his example. The balance he says was no longer even between
them; the <span id="page_28">p. 28</span> <span
id="iv.ii-Page_28"></span>scale of Basil mounted heavenward, while his
own was depressed by the weight of earthly interests, and youthful
ambitions. For a time he continued to practise in the law courts and to
frequent the theatre, and other places of amusement. But gradually the
study of Scripture, and saintly Bishop of Antioch so wrought upon his
mind that he resolved to abandon his secular calling. And in the first
place after the usual course of probation he was baptized. It may seem
surprising that he had not been baptized in childhood; but a corrupt
practice of delaying baptism (which Chrysostom himself often reprobates
in his Homilies) was prevalent at that time. It was due in some persons
to a notion that sin before Baptism was comparatively venial, in others
to a dread of binding themselves or their children to the purity of life
which was demanded by the Baptismal vows. In the case of Chrysostom it
is possible, I think, that the distracted condition of the church in
Antioch may have operated as a reason, perhaps the chief reason for the
delay. At the date of his birth (about A.D. 345) and for sixteen years
afterwards the See was occupied by Arian Bishops of the most worldly
time-serving type. The good Catholic Bishop Meletius was appointed in
361 and it was probably some seven or eight years later that Chrysostom
was baptized by him, and ordained to the office of Reader in the Church.

<span id="iv.ii-p6"></span>There can be no doubt that Baptism, from
whatever cause delayed, must have come home to the recipient at last
with all the more solemnity of meaning. It was often a decisive turning
point in the life, the beginning of a definite renunciation of the
world, and dedication of the whole man to God. To Chrysostom it
evidently was this. For a time he became an enthusiastic ascetic; and
then settled down into that more tranquil, but intense glow of piety
which burned with unabated force to the close of his life. His baptism
and the relinquishment of his secular calling are probably alluded to in
the following treatise c. 3. where he speaks of “emerging a little from
the flood of worldliness” in which he had been involved. His friend
Basil who received him with open arms does not seem to have joined any
monastic community, but merely to have been living in retirement and
practising some of the usual monastic austerities. The two friends now
formed a plan for withdrawing together to some quiet retreat, there to
support one another in habits of study, meditation, and prayer. c. 4.
The execution of the project was delayed for a time by the passionate
entreaties of Chrysostom’s mother that he would not deprive her of his
companionship and protection. c. 5. He must have been a poor companion
however, for we learn (vi. c. 12) that he rarely went outside the house,
maintained an almost perpetual silence, and was constantly absorbed in
study and prayer. He and Basil in fact formed with a few other friends a
voluntary association of youthful ascetics who lived under a strict
rule. We might compare it with the association or club formed by John
Wesley and his brother at Oxford which first earned for them the
nickname of “Methodists.” Chrysostom and his friends placed the general
regulation of their studies and religious life under Diodorus and
Carterius the presidents of the two principal monastic communities in
the neighborhood of Antioch. Diodorus was a man of learning and ability,
opposed to those mystical and allegorical interpretations of Holy
Scripture which often disguised rather than elucidated the real meaning
of the sacred text, so that to his training probably we are largely
indebted for that clear, sensible practical method of exposition in
which Chrysostom so remarkably excels nearly all the ancient father of
the Church.

<span id="iv.ii-p7"></span>Not long after the two friends had adopted
this course of life, probably about the year 374, they were agitated by
a report that they were likely to be advanced to the Episcopate (c. 6.)
By a custom which was then common in the Church they were liable if
elected by the clergy and people to be forcibly seized and ordained
however unwilling they might be to accept the dignity \[see notes to
chapters 6 and 7\]. Basil entreated his friend that in this crisis of
their lives they might act as in former times in concert, and together
accept, or <span id="page_29">p. 29</span> <span
id="iv.ii-Page_29"></span>evade if possible the expected but unwelcome
honor. Chrysostom affected assent to this proposal, but secretly
resolved to entrap Basil into the sacred office for which he considered
him to be as eminently fitted, as he deemed himself to be unworthy. The
Church should not on account of his own feebleness be deprived if he
could help it, of the able ministrations of such a man as Basil.
Accordingly when some agents of the electing body \[as to the
composition of this body, see note 3, p. 21\] were sent to seize the two
young men, Chrysostom contrived to hide himself. His language c. 6.
seems to imply that he had some intimation of their coming which he
purposely withheld from Basil who consequently was caught. He made at
first a violent resistance, but the officials led him to suppose that
Chrysostom had already submitted, and under this delusion he acquiesced.
When he discovered the trick which had been played upon him he naturally
reproached Chrysostom bitterly for his unkind treachery. But the
conscience of Chrysostom seems to have been quite at ease throughout the
transaction. He regarded it as a pious fraud and when he saw the mingled
distress and anger of his friend he could not refrain, he says, from
laughing aloud for joy, and thanking God for the success of his
stratagem. The remainder of the 1st Book \[chs. 8, 9\] is occupied by
Chrysostom’s vindication of his conduct, the principle that deceit for a
righteous end is often salutary and justifiable being maintained with an
ingenuity and skill which bespeaks a man who had recently practised in
the law-courts. His arguments indeed savor somewhat unpleasantly of
casuistry, and it must be confessed that in his conduct on this occasion
there is a tinge of something like oriental duplicity which is repugnant
to our moral sense. On the other hand it must be borne in mind that
neither in the East nor in the West, for many ages were “pious frauds”
absolutely condemned by the conscience of Christendom; there was always
an inclination to judge each case on its own merits, and to condone if
not to approve those in which the balance of evidence was in favor of a
righteous or holy purpose, and a beneficial result. And it must also be
owned, in justice to Chrysostom, that one of the qualities most
conspicuous in him throughout the whole of his subsequent career is
fearless, straightforward honesty alike in act and in speech; and this
under the pressure very often of strong temptation to dissemble and
temporize.

<span id="iv.ii-p8"></span>The remaining books on the Priesthood treat
of the pre-eminent dignity, and sanctity of the priestly office and the
peculiar difficulties and perils which beset it. They abound with wise
and weighty observations instructive for all times, but they are also
interesting from the light which they throw upon the condition of the
Church and of society in the age when Chrysostom lived. It is to be
noted that he is speaking of the priesthood generally and that it is not
always easy to say in any given passage which of the first two orders in
the ministry he has in his mind. In many instances perhaps he was not
thinking of one more than the other. Where, as was very commonly the
case, the jurisdiction of a bishop did not extend very far beyond the
limits of the city in which his See was placed, his functions would more
nearly resemble those which in our day are discharged by the incumbent
of a large town parish than those which are performed by the modern
Bishop of a large diocese. He was the chief pastor of the people, as
well as the overseer of the clergy. Chrysostom’s friend Basil has been
confused by some with the great Basil, Bishop of Cæsarea in Cappadocia,
who was fifteen years older than Chrysostom, by others with Basil Bishop
of Seleucia, who was many years younger. Nothing in fact is known about
him beyond what is recorded in this treatise, but he has been
conjecturally identified with Basil Bishop of Raphnea in Syria, not far
from Antioch, who attended the Council of Constantinople in 381.
