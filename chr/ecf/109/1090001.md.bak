<span id="ii-p3"></span>With this volume, we begin the Works of St.
Chrysostom. It contains a sketch of his life and labors, the book on the
priesthood, the letters to Theodore, the catechetical instructions, and
a selection of ascetic treatises, special homilies, letters to Olympias
and Innocent, and the twenty-one Homilies on the Statues.

<span id="ii-p4"></span>The translations are entirely new, or thoroughly
revised, by the Rev. W. R. W. Stephens, whose services I was so
fortunate as to secure. He has written the best biography of St.
Chrysostom and is thoroughly at home in his writings. He has taken great
pains, with the aid of two friends, the Rev. T. P. Brandram and Rev. R.
Blackburn, and is responsible for the whole volume, with the exception
of the Prolegomena, which I wrote myself, to correspond with the
Prolegomena to the works of St. Augustin.

<span id="ii-p5"></span>The other volumes of St. Chrysostom in this
series will be devoted to his exegetical Homilies on the greater part of
the New Testament.
