<span id="ix.ii-p3"></span><span class="c34"><span
id="ix.ii-p3.1"></span>first instruction.</span>

<span id="ix.ii-p4"></span>To those about to be illuminated; <span
id="fr_491"></span>[492](#fn_491.md) and for what reason the laver is said
to be of regeneration and not of remission of sins; and that it is a
dangerous thing not only to forswear oneself, but also to take an oath,
even though we swear truly.

<span id="ix.ii-p6"></span>1. <span class="c12"><span
id="ix.ii-p6.1"></span>How</span> delightful and lovable is our band of
young brethren! For brethren I call you, even now before you have been
brought forth, and before your birth I welcome this relationship with
you: For I know, I know clearly, to how great an honour you are about to
be led, and to how great a dignity; and those who are about to receive
dignity, all are wont to honor, even before the dignity is conferred,
laying up for themselves beforehand by their attention good will for the
future. And this also I myself now do. For ye are not about to be led to
an empty dignity, but to an actual kingdom: and not simply to a kingdom,
but to the kingdom of the Heavens itself. Wherefore I beseech and
entreat you that you remember me when you come into that kingdom, and as
Joseph said to the chief butler “Remember me when it shall be well with
thee,” <span id="fr_492"></span>[493](#fn_492.md) this also I say now to
you, do ye remember me when it is well with you. I do not ask this in
return for interpreting your dreams, as he; for I have not come to
interpret dreams for you, but to discourse of matters celestial, and to
convey to you glad tidings of such good things as “eye hath not seen,
and ear hath not heard and which have entered not into the heart of man,
such are the things which God hath prepared for them that love
him.” <span id="fr_493"></span>[494](#fn_493.md) Now Joseph indeed said to
that chief butler, “yet three days and Pharaoh will restore thee to thy
chief butlership.” But I do not say, yet three days and ye shall be set
to pour out the wine of a tyrant, but yet thirty days, and not Pharaoh
but the king of Heaven shall restore you to the country which is on
high, Jerusalem, which is free—to the city which is in the heavens; and
*he* said indeed, “Thou shalt give the cup into the hands of Pharaoh.”
But I say not that you shall give the cup into the hands of the king,
but that the king shall give the cup into your hand—that dread cup, full
of much power, and more precious than any created thing. The initiated
know the virtue of this cup, and you yourselves shall know it a little
while hence. Remember me, therefore, when you come into that kingdom,
when you receive the royal robe, when you are girt with the purple
dipped in the master’s blood, when you will be <span id="page_160">p.
160</span> <span id="ix.ii-Page_160"></span>crowned with the diadem,
which has lustre leaping forth from it on all sides, more brilliant than
the rays of the sun. Such are the gifts of the Bridegroom, greater
indeed than your worth, but worthy of his lovingkindness.

<span id="ix.ii-p9"></span>Wherefore, I count you blessed already before
those sacred nuptials, and I do not only count you blessed, but I praise
your prudence in that you have not come to your illumination as the most
slothful among men, at your last breath, but already, like prudent
servants, prepared with much goodwill to obey your master, have brought
the neck of your soul with much meekness and readiness beneath the bands
of Christ, and have received His easy yoke, and have taken His light
burden. For if the grace bestowed be the same both for you and for those
who are initiated at their last hour, yet the matter of the intention is
not the same, nor yet the matter of the preparation for the rite. For
they indeed receive it on their bed, but you in the bosom of the Church,
which is the common mother of us all; they indeed with lamentation and
weeping, but you rejoicing, and exceeding glad: they sighing, you giving
thanks; they indeed lethargic with much fever, you filled with much
spiritual pleasure; wherefore in your case all things are in harmony
with the gift, but in theirs all are adverse to it. For there is wailing
and much lamentation on the part of the initiated, and children stand
around crying, wife tearing her cheeks, and dejected friends and tearful
servants; the whole aspect of the house resembles some wintry and gloomy
day. And if thou shalt open the heart of him who is lying there, thou
wilt find it more downcast than are these. For as winds meeting one
another with many a contrary blast, break up the sea into many parts, so
too the thought of the terrors preying upon him assail the soul of the
sick man, and distract his mind with many anxieties. Whenever he sees
his children, he thinks of their fatherless condition; whenever he looks
from them to his wife, he considers her widowhood; when he sees the
servants, he beholds the desolation of the whole house; when he comes
back to himself, he calls to mind his own present life, and being about
to be torn from it, experiences a great cloud of despondency. Of such a
kind is the soul of him who is about to be initiated. Then in the midst
of its tumult and confusion, the Priest enters, more formidable than the
fever itself, and more distressing than death to the relatives of the
sick man. For the entrance of the Presbyter is thought to be a greater
reason for despair than the voice of the physician despairing of his
life, and that which suggests eternal life seems to be a symbol of
death. But I have not yet put the finishing stroke to these ills. For in
the midst of relatives raising a tumult and making preparations, the
soul has often taken its flight, leaving the body desolate; and in many
cases, while it was present it was useless, for when it neither
recognizes those who are present, nor hears their voice, nor is able to
answer those words by which it will make that blessed covenant with the
common master of us all, but is as a useless log, or a stone, and he who
is about to be illuminated lies there differing nothing from a corpse,
what is the profit of initiation in a case of such insensibility?

<span id="ix.ii-p10"></span>2. For he who is about to approach these
holy and dread mysteries must be awake and alert, must be clean from all
cares of this life, full of much self-restraint, much readiness; he must
banish from his mind every thought foreign to the mysteries, and on all
sides cleanse and prepare his home, as if about to receive the king
himself. Such is the preparation of your mind: such are your thoughts;
such the purpose of your soul. Await therefore a return worthy of this
most excellent decision from God, who overpowers with His recompense
those who show forth obedience to Him. But since it is necessary for his
fellow servants to contribute of their own, then we will contribute of
our own; yea rather not even are these things our own, but these too are
our Master’s. “For what hast thou,” saith He, “that thou didst not
receive? but if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory, as if thou
hadst not received it?” <span id="fr_494"></span>[495](#fn_494.md) I wished
to say this first of all, why in the world our fathers, passing by the
whole year, settled that the children of the Church should be initiated
at this season; and for what reason, after the instruction from us,
removing your shoes and raiment, unclad and unshod, with but one garment
on, they conduct you to hear the words of the exorcisers. For it is not
thoughtlessly and rashly that they have planned this dress and this
season for us. But both these things have a certain mystic and secret
reason. And I wish to say this to you. But I see that our discourse now
constrains us to something more necessary to say what baptism is, and
for what reason it enters into our life, and what good things it conveys
to us.

<span id="ix.ii-p12"></span>But, if you will, let us discourse about the
name which this mystic cleansing bears: for its name is not one, but
very many and various. For this purification is called the laver of
regeneration. “He saved us,” he saith, “through the laver of
regeneration, and renewing of the <span id="page_161">p. 161</span>
<span id="ix.ii-Page_161"></span>Holy Ghost.” <span
id="fr_495"></span>[496](#fn_495.md) It is called also illumination, and
this St. Paul again has called it, “For call to remembrance the former
days in which after ye were illuminated ye endured a great conflict of
sufferings;” <span id="fr_496"></span>[497](#fn_496.md) and again, “For it
is impossible for those who were once illuminated, and have tasted of
the heavenly gift, and then fell away, to renew them again unto
repentance.” <span id="fr_497"></span>[498](#fn_497.md) It is called also,
baptism: “For as many of you as were baptized into Christ did put on
Christ.” <span id="fr_498"></span>[499](#fn_498.md) It is called also
burial: “For we were buried” saith he, “with him, through baptism, into
death.” <span id="fr_499"></span>[500](#fn_499.md) It is called
circumcision: “In whom ye were also circumcised, with a circumcision not
made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the sins of the
flesh.” <span id="fr_500"></span>[501](#fn_500.md) It is called a cross:
“Our old man was crucified with him that the body of sin might be done
away.” <span id="fr_501"></span>[502](#fn_501.md) It is also possible to
speak of other names besides these, but in order that we should not
spend our whole time over the names of this free gift, come, return to
the first name, and let us finish our discourse by declaring its
meaning; but in the meantime, let us extend our teaching a little
further. There is that laver by means of the baths, common to all men,
which is wont to wipe off bodily uncleanness; and there is the Jewish
laver, more honorable than the other, but far inferior to that of grace;
and it too wipes off bodily uncleanness but not simply uncleanness of
body, since it even reaches to the weak conscience. For there are many
matters, which by nature indeed are not unclean, but which become
unclean from the weakness of the conscience. And as in the case of
little children, masks, and other bugbears are not in themselves
alarming, but seem to little children to be alarming, by reason of the
weakness of their nature, so it is in the case of those things of which
I was speaking; just as to touch dead bodies is not naturally unclean,
but when this comes into contact with a weak conscience, it makes him
who touches them unclean. For that the thing in question is not unclean
naturally, Moses himself who ordained this law showed, when he bore off
the entire corpse of Joseph, and yet remained clean. On this account
Paul also, discoursing to us about this uncleanness which does not come
naturally but by reason of the weakness of the conscience, speaks
somewhat in this way, “Nothing is common of itself save to him who
accounteth anything to be common.” <span
id="fr_502"></span>[503](#fn_502.md) Dost thou not see that uncleanness
does not arise from the nature of the thing, but from the weakness of
the reasoning about it? And again: “All things indeed are clean, howbeit
it is evil to that man who eateth with offense.” <span
id="fr_503"></span>[504](#fn_503.md) Dost thou see that it is not to eat,
but to eat with offense, that is the cause of uncleanness?

<span id="ix.ii-p22"></span>3. Such is the defilement from which the
laver of the Jews cleansed. But the laver of grace, not such, but the
real uncleanness which has introduced defilement into the soul as well
as into the body. For it does not make those who have touched dead
bodies clean, but those who have set their hand to dead works: and if
any man be effeminate, or a fornicator, or an idolator, or a doer of
whatever ill you please, or if he be full of all the wickedness there is
among men: should he fall into this pool of waters, he comes up again
from the divine fountain purer than the sun’s rays. And in order that
thou mayest not think that what is said is mere vain boasting, hear Paul
speaking of the power of the laver, “Be not deceived: neither idolators,
nor fornicators, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of
themselves with men, nor covetous, not drunkards, not revilers, not
extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God.” <span
id="fr_504"></span>[505](#fn_504.md) And what has this to do with what has
been spoken? says one, “for prove the question whether the power of the
laver thoroughly cleanses all these things.” Hear therefore what
follows: “And such were some of you, but ye were washed, but ye were
sanctified, but ye were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ,
and in the spirit of our God.” *We* promise to show you that they who
approach the laver become clean from all fornication: but the word has
shown more, that they have become not only clean, but both holy and
just, for it does not say only “ye were washed,” but also “ye were
sanctified and were justified.” What could be more strange than this,
when without toil, and exertion, and good works, righteousness is
produced? For such is the lovingkindness of the Divine gift that it
makes men just without this exertion. For if a letter of the Emperor, a
few words being added, sets free those who are liable to countless
accusations, and brings others to the highest honors; much rather will
the Holy Spirit of God, who is able to do all things, free us from all
evil and grant us much righteousness, and fill us with much assurance,
and as a spark falling into the wide sea would straightway be quenched,
or would become invisible, being overwhelmed by the multitude of the
waters, so also all human wickedness, when it falls into the pool of the
divine fountain, is more swiftly and easily overwhelmed, <span
id="page_162">p. 162</span> <span id="ix.ii-Page_162"></span>and made
invisible, than that spark. And for what reason, says one, if the laver
take away all our sins, is it called, not a laver of remission of sins,
nor a laver of cleansing, but a laver of regeneration? Because it does
not simply take away our sins, nor simply cleanse us from our faults,
but so as if we were born again. For it creates and fashions us anew not
forming us again out of earth, but creating us out of another element,
namely, of the nature of water. For it does not simply wipe the vessel
clean, but entirely remoulds it again. For that which is wiped clean,
even if it be cleaned with care, has traces of its former condition, and
bears the remains of its defilement, but that which falls into the new
mould, and is renewed by means of the flames, laying aside all
uncleanness, comes forth from the furnace, and sends forth the same
brilliancy with things newly formed. As therefore any one who takes and
recasts a golden statue which has been tarnished by time, smoke, dust,
rust, restores it to us thoroughly cleansed and glistening: so too this
nature of ours, rusted with the rust of sin, and having gathered much
smoke from our faults, and having lost its beauty, which He had from the
beginning bestowed upon it from himself, God has taken and cast anew,
and throwing it into the waters as into a mould, and instead of fire
sending forth the grace of the Spirit, then brings us forth with much
brightness, renewed, and made afresh, to rival the beams of the sun,
having crushed the old man, and having fashioned a new man, more
brilliant than the former.

<span id="ix.ii-p24"></span>4. And speaking darkly of this crushing, and
this mystic cleansing, the prophet of old said, “Thou shalt dash them in
pieces like a potter’s vessel.” <span id="fr_505"></span>[506](#fn_505.md)
For that the word is in reference to the faithful, what goes before
sufficiently shows us, “For thou art my Son,” he says, “to-day have I
begotten thee, ask of me and I will give the heathen for three
inheritance, the utmost parts of the earth for thy possession.” <span
id="fr_506"></span>[507](#fn_506.md) Dost thou see how he has made mention
of the church of the Gentiles, and has spoken of the kingdom of Christ
extended on all sides? Then he says again, “Thou shalt rule them with a
rod of iron;” not grievous, but strong: “thou shalt break them in pieces
like a potter’s vessel.” <span id="fr_507"></span>[508](#fn_507.md) Behold
then, the laver is more mystically brought forward. For he does not say
earthen vessels: but vessels of the potter. But, give heed: For earthen
vessels when crushed would not admit of refashioning, on account of the
hardness which was gained by them from the fire. But the fact is that
the vessels of the potter are not earthen, but of clay; wherefore, also,
when they have been distorted, they can easily, by the skill of the
artificer, be brought again to a second shape. When, therefore, God
speaks of an irremediable calamity, he does not say vessels of the
potter, but an earthen vessel; when, for instance, he wished to teach
the prophet and the Jews that he delivered up the city to an
irremediable calamity, he bade him take an earthen wine-vessel, and
crush it before all the people, and say, “Thus shall this city be
destroyed, be broken in pieces.” <span id="fr_508"></span>[509](#fn_508.md)
But when he wishes to hold out good hopes to them, he brings the prophet
to a pottery, and does not show him an earthen vessel, but shows him a
vessel of clay, which was in the hands of the potter, falling to the
ground: and brings him to it saying, “If this potter has taken up and
remodelled his vessel which has fallen, shall I not much rather be able
to restore you when you have fallen?” <span
id="fr_509"></span>[510](#fn_509.md) It is possible therefore for God not
only to restore those who are made of clay, through the laver of
regeneration, but to bring back again to their original state, on their
careful repentance, those who have received the power of the Spirit, and
have lapsed. But this is not the time for you to hear words about
repentance, rather may the time never come for you to fall into the need
of these remedies, but may you always remain in preservation of the
beauty and the brightness which ye are now about to receive, unsullied.
In order, then, that ye may ever remain thus, come and let us discourse
to you a little about your manner of life. For in the wrestling schools
falls of the athletes are devoid of danger. For the wrestling is with
friends, and they practice all their exercises on the persons of their
teachers. But when the time of the contest has come, when the lists are
open, when the spectators are seated above, when the president has
arrived, it necessarily follows that the combatants, if they become
careless, fall and retire in great disgrace, or if they are in earnest,
win the crowns and the prizes. So then, in your case these thirty days
are like some wrestling school, both for exercise and practice: let us
learn from thence already to get the better of that evil demon. For it
is to contend with him that we have to strip ourselves, with him after
baptism are we to box and fight. Let us learn from thence already his
grip, on what side he is aggressive, on what side he can easily threaten
us, in order that, when the contest comes on, we may not feel strange,
nor become confused, as seeing new forms of wrestling; but having
already prac<span id="page_163">p. 163</span> <span
id="ix.ii-Page_163"></span>ticed them amongst ourselves, and having
learnt all his methods, may engage in these forms of wrestling against
him with courage. In all ways, therefore, is he accustomed to threaten
us, but especially by means of the tongue, and the mouth. For there is
no organ so convenient for him for our deception and our destruction as
an unchastened tongue and an unchecked utterance. Hence come many slips
on our part: hence many serious accusations against us. And the ease of
these falls through the tongue a certain one showed, when he said, “Many
fell by the sword, but not so many as by the tongue.” <span
id="fr_510"></span>[511](#fn_510.md) Now the gravity of the fall the same
person shows us again when he says: “To slip upon a pavement is better
than to slip with the tongue.” <span id="fr_511"></span>[512](#fn_511.md)
And what he speaks of is of this kind. Better it is, says he, that the
body should fall and be crushed, than that such a word should go forth
as destroys the soul; and he does not speak of falls merely; he also
admonishes us that much forethought should be exercised, so that we
should not be tripped up, thus saying “Make a door and bars for thy
mouth,” <span id="fr_512"></span>[513](#fn_512.md) not that we should
prepare doors and bars, but that with much security, we should shut the
tongue off from outrageous words; and again in another place, after
showing that we need influence from above, both as accompanying and
preceding our own effort so as to keep this wild beast within:
stretching forth his hands to God, the prophet said, “Let the lifting up
of my hands be an evening sacrifice, set a watch, O Lord, before my
mouth, keep the door of my lips;” and he who before admonished, himself
too <span id="fr_513"></span>[514](#fn_513.md) says again “Who shall set a
watch before my mouth, and a seal of wisdom upon my lips?” <span
id="fr_514"></span>[515](#fn_514.md) Dost thou not see, each one fearing
these falls and bewailing them, both giving advice, and praying that the
tongue may have the benefit of much watchfulness? and for what reason,
says one, if this organ brings us such ruin, did God originally place it
within us? Because indeed, it is of great use, and if we are careful, it
is of use only, and brings no ruin. Hear, for example, what he says who
spoke the former words, “Death and life are in the power of the
tongue.” <span id="fr_515"></span>[516](#fn_515.md) And Christ points to
the same thing when he says, “By thy words thou shalt be condemned, and
by thy words thou shalt be justified.” <span
id="fr_516"></span>[517](#fn_516.md) For the tongue stands in the midst
ready for use on either hand. Thou art its master. Thus indeed a sword
lies in the midst, and if thou use it against thine enemies, this organ
becomes a means of safety for thee. But if thou thrust its stroke
against thyself, not the nature of the iron, but thine own transgression
becomes the cause of thy slaughter. Let us then take this view of the
tongue. It is a sword lying in the midst; sharpen it for the purpose of
accusing thine own sins. Thrust not the stroke against thy brother. For
this reason God surrounded it with a double fortification; with the
fence of the teeth and the barrier of the lips, that it may not rashly
and without circumspection utter words which are not convenient. Well,
dost thou say it will not endure this? Bridle it therefore within.
Restrain it by means of the teeth, as though giving over its body to
these executioners and making them bite it. For it is better that when
it sins now it should be bitten by the teeth, than one day when it seeks
a drop of water and is parched with heat, to be unable to obtain this
consolation. In many other ways indeed it is wont to sin, by raillery
and blasphemy, by uttering foul words, by slander, swearing, and
perjury.

<span id="ix.ii-p37"></span>5. But in order that we may not by saying
everything at once to-day, confuse your minds, we put before you one
custom, namely, about the avoidance of oaths, saying this much by way of
preface, and speaking plainly—that if you do not avoid oaths, I say not
perjury merely, but those too which happen in the cause of justice, we
shall not further discourse upon any other subject. For it is monstrous
that teachers of letters should not give a second lesson to their
children until they see the former one fixed well in their memory, but
that we, without being able to express our first lessons clearly, should
inculcate others before the first are completed. For this is nothing
else than to pour into a perforated jar. Give great care, then, that ye
silence not our mouth. For this error is grave, and it is exceedingly
grave because it does not seem to be grave, and on this account I fear
it, because no one fears it. On this account the disease is incurable,
because it does not seem to be a disease; but just as simple speech is
not a crime, so neither does this seem to be a crime, but with much
boldness this transgression is committed: and if any one call it in
question, straightway laughter follows, and much ridicule, not of those
who are called in question for their oaths, but of those who wish to
rectify the disease. On this account I largely extend my discourse about
these matters. For I wish to pull up a deep root, and to wipe out a
long-standing evil: I speak not of perjury alone, but even of oaths in
good faith. But so and so, says one, a forbearing man, consecrated to
the priesthood, living in much self-control and piety, takes an oath. Do
not speak to me of this forbearing person, this <span id="page_164">p.
164</span> <span id="ix.ii-Page_164"></span>self-controlled, pious man
who is consecrated to the priesthood; but if thou wilt, add that this
man is Peter, or Paul, or even an angel descended out of heaven. For not
even in such a case do I regard the dignity of their persons. For the
law which I read upon oaths, is not that of the servant, but of the
King: and when the edicts of a king are read, let every claim of the
servants be silent. But if thou art able to say that Christ bade us use
oaths, or that Christ did not punish the doing of this, show me, and I
am persuaded. But if he forbids it with so much care, and takes so much
thought about the matter as to class him who takes an oath with the evil
one (for whatsoever is more than these, namely, than yea and nay, saith
he, is of the devil), <span id="fr_517"></span>[518](#fn_517.md) why dost
thou bring this person and that person forward? For not because of the
carelessness of thy fellow servants, but from the injunctions of his own
laws, will God record his vote against thee. I have commanded, he says,
thou oughtest to obey, not to shelter thyself behind such and such a
person and concern thyself with other persons’ evil. Since the great
David sinned a grievous sin, is it then safe for us to sin? Tell me: on
this account then we ought to make sure of this point, and only to
emulate the good works of the saints; and if there is carelessness, and
transgression of the law anywhere, we ought to flee from it with great
care. For our reckoning is not with our fellow-servants, but with our
Master, and to him we shall give account for all done in our life. Let
us prepare ourselves therefore for this tribunal. For even if he who
transgresses this law be beyond everything revered and great, he shall
certainly pay the penalty attaching to the transgression. For God is no
respecter of persons. How then and in what way is it possible to flee
from this sin? For one ought to show not only that the crime is
grievous, but to give counsel how we may escape from it. Hast thou a
wife, hast thou a servant, children, friends, acquaintance, neighbors?
To all these enjoin caution on these matters. Custom is a grievous
thing, terrible to supplant, and hard to guard against, and it often
attacks us unwilling and unknowing; therefore in so far as thou knowest
the power of custom, to such an extent study to be freed from any evil
custom, and transfer thyself to any other most useful one. For as that
custom is often able to trip thee up, though thou art careful, and
guardest thyself, and takest thought, and consideration, so if thou
transferrest thyself to the good custom of abstaining from oaths, thou
wilt not be able, either involuntarily or carelessly, to fall into the
fault of oaths. For custom is really great and has the power of nature.
In order then that we do not continually distress ourselves let us
transfer ourselves to another custom, and ask thou each one of thy
kindred and acquaintance this favor, that he advise thee and exhort thee
to flee from oaths, and reprove thee, when detected in them. For the
watch over thee which takes place on their part, is to them too counsel
and a suggestion to what is right. For he who reproves another for
oaths, will not himself easily fall into this pit. For much swearing is
no ordinary pit, not only when it is about little matters but about the
greatest. And we, whether buying vegetables, or quarrelling over two
farthings, or in a rage with our servants and threatening them, always
call upon God as our witness. But a freeman, possessed of some barren
dignity, thou wouldest not dare to call upon as witness in the market to
such things; but even if thou attemptedst it, thou wilt pay the penalty
of thine insolence. But the King of Heaven, the Lord of Angels, when
disputing both about purchases and money, and what not, thou draggest in
for a testimony. And how can these things be borne? whence then should
we escape from this evil custom? After setting those guards of which I
spoke round us, let us fix on a specified time to ourselves for
amendment, and adding thereto condemnation if, when the time has passed,
we have not amended this. How long time will suffice for the purpose? I
do not think that they who are very wary, and on the alert, and watchful
about their own salvation, should need more than ten days, so as to be
altogether free from the evil custom of oaths. But if after ten days we
be detected swearing, let us add a penalty due to ourselves, and let us
fix upon the greatest punishment and condemnation of the transgression;
what then is this condemnation? This I do not fix upon, but will suffer
you yourselves to determine the sentence. So we arrange matters in our
own case, not only in respect of oaths but in respect of other defects,
and fixing a time for ourselves, with most grievous punishments, if at
any time we have fallen into them, shall come clean to our Master, and
shall escape the fire of hell, and shall stand before the judgment seat
of Christ with boldness, to which may we all attain, by the grace and
lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, with whom be glory to the
Father together with the Holy Spirit for ever and ever: Amen.

<span id="ix.ii-p5"></span> *I.e*., to be baptized. A common name for
Baptism was “illumination,” partly with reference to the instructions
which preceded it, as Justin Martyr says; “The laver is called
illumination because the minds of those who learn these things are
enlightened:” partly also (perhaps rather) because baptism was regarded
as a translation from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of light,
the recipient becoming a child of God, and as such entitled to the grace
of the illuminating Spirit. Catechumens were divided into four classes
according to the stages of their preparation. It is to those who were in
the final stage, the competentes or elect as they were called, that the
following instructions are addressed.
