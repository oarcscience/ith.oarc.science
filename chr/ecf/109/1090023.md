<span id="iv.vi-p1"></span> <span id="page_60">p. 60</span> <span
id="iv.vi-Page_60"></span><span class="c17"><span
id="iv.vi-p1.1"></span>Book IV.</span>

<span id="iv.vi-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.vi-p2.1"></span>Basil</span> heard this, and after a little pause
thus replied:

<span id="iv.vi-p3"></span>If thou wert thyself ambitious of obtaining
this office, thy fear would have been reasonable; for in being ambitious
of undertaking it, a man confesses himself to be qualified for its
administration, and if he fail therein, after it has been entrusted to
him, he cannot take refuge in the plea of inexperience, for he has
deprived himself of this excuse beforehand, <span
id="fr_124"></span>[125](#fn_124.md) by having hurriedly seized upon the
ministry, and whoever willingly and deliberately enters upon it, can no
longer say, “I have sinned in this matter against my will—and against my
will I have ruined such and such a soul;” for He who will one day judge
him, will say to him, “Since then thou wert conscious of such
inexperience, and hadst not ability for undertaking this matter without
incurring reproach, why wert thou so eager and presumptuous as to take
in hand what was so far beyond thy power? Who compelled thee to do so?
Didst thou shrink or fly, and did any one drag thee on by force?” But
thou wilt hear nothing like this, for thou canst have nothing of this
kind to condemn thyself for; and it is evident to all that thou wert in
no degree ambitious of this dignity, for the accomplishment of the
matter was due to the action of others. Hence, circumstances which leave
those who are ambitious of this office no chance of pardon when they err
therein, afford thee ample ground for excuse.

<span id="iv.vi-p5"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.vi-p5.1"></span>Chrysostom</span>: At this I shook my head and
smiled a little, admiring the simple-mindedness of the man, and thus
addressed him: I could wish indeed that matters were as thou sayest,
most excellent of men, but not in order that I might be able to accept
that office from which I lately fled. For if, indeed, no chastisement
were to await me for undertaking the care of the flock of Christ without
consideration and experience, yet to me it would be worse than all
punishment, after being entrusted with so great a charge, to have seemed
so base towards Him who entrusted me with it. For what reason, then, did
I wish that thou wert not mistaken in this opinion of thine? truly for
the sake of those wretched and unhappy beings (for so must I call them,
who have not found out how to discharge the duties of this office well,
though thou wert to say ten thousand times <span id="page_61">p.
61</span> <span id="iv.vi-Page_61"></span>over that they had been driven
to undertake it, and that, therefore, their errors therein are sins of
ignorance)—for the sake, I say, of such that they might succeed in
escaping that unquenchable fire, and the outer darkness <span
id="fr_125"></span>[126](#fn_125.md) and the worm that dieth not <span
id="fr_126"></span>[127](#fn_126.md) and the punishment of being cut
asunder, <span id="fr_127"></span>[128](#fn_127.md) and perishing together
with the hypocrites.

<span id="iv.vi-p9"></span>But what am I to do for thee? It is not as
thou sayest; no, by no means. And if thou wilt, I will give thee a proof
of what I maintain, from the case of a kingdom, which is not of such
account with God as the priesthood. Saul, that son of Kish, was not
himself at all ambitious of becoming a king, but was going in quest of
his asses, and came to ask the prophet about them. The prophet, however,
proceeded to speak to him of the kingdom, but not even then did he run
greedily after it, though he heard about it from a prophet, but drew
back and deprecated it, saying, “Who am I, and what is my father’s
house.” <span id="fr_128"></span>[129](#fn_128.md) What then? When he made
a bad use of the honor which had been given him by God, were those words
of his able to rescue him from the wrath of Him who had made him king?
And was he able to say to Samuel, when rebuked by him: “Did I greedily
run and rush after the kingdom and sovereign power? I wished to lead the
undisturbed and peaceful life of ordinary men, but *thou* didst drag me
to this post of honor. Had I remained in my low estate I should easily
have escaped all these stumbling blocks, for were I one of the obscure
multitude, I should never have been sent forth on this expedition, nor
would God have committed to my hands the war against the Amalekites, and
if I had not had it committed to me, I should not have sinned this sin.”
But all such arguments are weak as excuses, and not only weak, but
perilous, inasmuch as they rather kindle the wrath of God. For he who
has been promoted to great honor by God, must not advance the greatness
of his honor as an excuse for his errors, but should make God’s special
favor towards him the motive for further improvement; whereas he who
thinks himself at liberty to sin because he has obtained some uncommon
dignity, what does he but study to show that the lovingkindness of God
is the cause of his personal transgression, which is always the argument
of those who lead godless and careless lives. But *we* ought to be on no
account thus minded, nor to fall away into the insane folly of such
people, but be ambitious at all times to make the most of such powers as
we have, and to be reverent both in speech and thought.

<span id="iv.vi-p11"></span>For (to leave the kingdom and to come to the
priesthood, which is the more immediate subject of our discourse)
neither was Eli ambitious of obtaining his high office, yet what
advantage was this to him when he sinned therein? But why do I say
obtain it? not even had he wished could he have avoided it, because he
was under a legal necessity to accept it. For he was of the tribe of
Levi, and was bound to undertake that high office which descended to him
from his forefathers, notwithstanding which even he paid no small
penalty for the lawlessness <span id="fr_129"></span>[130](#fn_129.md) of
his sons. And the very first High Priest of the Jews, <span
id="fr_130"></span>[131](#fn_130.md) concerning whom God spake so many
words to Moses, when he was unable to withstand alone the frenzy of so
great a multitude, was he not very nearly being destroyed, but for the
intercession of his brother, which averted the wrath of God? <span
id="fr_131"></span>[132](#fn_131.md) And since we have mentioned Moses, it
will be well to show the truth of what we are saying from what happened
to him. For this same saintly Moses was so far from grasping at the
leadership of the Jews as to deprecate the offer, <span
id="fr_132"></span>[133](#fn_132.md) and to decline it when God commanded
him to take it, and so to provoke the wrath of Him who appointed him;
and not only then, but afterwards when he entered upon his rule, he
would gladly have died to have been set free from it: “Kill me,” saith
he, “if thou art going to deal thus with me.” <span
id="fr_133"></span>[134](#fn_133.md) But what then? when he sinned at the
waters of strife, <span id="fr_134"></span>[135](#fn_134.md) could these
repeated refusals be pleaded in excuse for him? Could they prevail with
God to grant him pardon? And wherefore was he deprived of the promised
land? for no other reason, as we all know, than for this sin of his, for
which that wondrous man was debarred from enjoying the same blessings
which those over whom he ruled obtained; but after many labors and
sufferings, after that unspeakable wandering, after so many battles
fought and victories won, he died outside the land to reach which he had
undergone so much toil and trial; and though he had weathered the storms
of the deep, he failed to enjoy the blessings of the haven after all.
From hence then thou seest that not only they who grasp at this office
are left without excuse for the sins they commit in the dis<span
id="page_62">p. 62</span> <span id="iv.vi-Page_62"></span>charge
thereof, but they too who come to it through the ambitious desire of
others; for truly if those persons who have been chosen for this high
office by God himself, though they have never so often refused it, have
paid such heavy penalties, and if nothing has availed to deliver any of
them from this danger, neither Aaron nor Eli, nor that holy man the
Saint, the prophet, the wonder worker, the meek above all the men which
were upon the face of the earth, <span id="fr_135"></span>[136](#fn_135.md)
who spake with God, as a man speaketh unto his friend, <span
id="fr_136"></span>[137](#fn_136.md) hardly shall we who fall so infinitely
short of the excellence of that great man, be able to plead as a
sufficient excuse the consciousness that we have never been ambitious of
the dignity, more especially when many of the ordinations now-a-days do
not proceed from the grace of God, but are due to human ambition. God
chose Judas, and counted him one of the sacred band, and committed to
him, as to the rest, the dignity of the apostolic office; yea he gave
him somewhat beyond the others, the stewardship of the money. <span
id="fr_137"></span>[138](#fn_137.md) But what of that? when he afterwards
abused both these trusts, betraying Him whom he was commissioned to
preach, and misapplying the money which he should have laid out well;
did he escape punishment? <span id="fr_138"></span>[139](#fn_138.md) nay
for this very reason he even brought upon himself greater punishment,
and very reasonably too. For we must not use the high honors given to us
by God so as to offend Him, but so as to please Him better. But he who
claims exemption from punishment where it is due, because he has been
exalted to higher honor than others, acts very much like one of those
unbelieving Jews, who after hearing Christ say, “If I had not come and
spoken unto them, they had not had sin,” “If I had not done among them
the works which none other did, they had not had sin,” <span
id="fr_139"></span>[140](#fn_139.md) should reproach the Saviour and
benefactor of mankind by replying, “Why, then, didst thou come and
speak? why didst thou work miracles? was it that thou mightest punish us
the more?” But these are the words of madness and of utter
senselessness. For the Great Physician came not to give thee over, but
to heal thee—not to pass thee by when thou wert sick, but to rid thee
entirely of disease. But thou hast of thine own accord withdrawn thyself
from his hands; receive therefore the sorer punishment. For as thou
wouldest have been freed from thy former maladies if thou hadst yielded
to his treatment, so if, when thou sawest him coming to thine aid thou
fleddest from him, thou wilt no longer be able to cleanse thyself of
these infirmities, and as thou art unable, thou wilt both suffer
punishment for them, and also because for thy part thou madest God’s
solicitude for thy good of none effect. Therefore we who act like this
are not subjected to the same torment after as before we received honor
at God’s hands, but far severer torment after than before. For he who
has not become good even by being well treated, deserves all the
bitterer punishment. Since, then, this excuse of thine has been shown to
be weak, and not only fails to save those who take refuge in it, but
exposes them so much the more, we must provide ourselves with some other
means of safety.

<span id="iv.vi-p23"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.vi-p23.1"></span>Basil</span>: Tell me of what nature is that?
since, as for me, I am at present scarce master of myself, thou hast
reduced me to such a state of fear and trembling by what thou hast said.

<span id="iv.vi-p24"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.vi-p24.1"></span>Chrysostom</span>: Do not, I beseech and implore
thee, do not be so downcast. For while there is safety for us who are
weak, namely, in not undertaking this office at all, there is safety for
you too who are strong, and this consists in making your hopes of
salvation depend, next to the grace of God, on avoiding every act
unworthy of this gift, and of God who gave it. For they certainly would
be deserving of the greatest punishment who, after obtaining this
dignity through their own ambition, should then either on account of
sloth, or wickedness, or even inexperience, abuse the office. Not that
we are to gather from this that there is pardon in store for those who
have not been thus ambitious. Yea, even they too are deprived of all
excuse. For in my judgment, if ten thousand were to entreat and urge, a
man should pay them no attention, but should first of all search his own
heart, and examine the whole matter carefully before yielding to their
importunities. Now no one would venture to undertake the building of a
house were he not an architect, nor will any one attempt the cure of
sick bodies who is not a skilled physician; but even though many urge
him, will beg off, and will not be ashamed to own his ignorance; and
shall he who is going to have the care of so many souls entrusted to
him, not examine himself beforehand? will he accept this ministry even
though he be the most inexperienced of men, because this one commands
him, or that man constrains him, or for fear of offending a third? And
if so, how will he escape casting himself together with them into
manifest misery. Had he continued as he was, it were possible for him to
be saved, but now he involves others in his own destruction. For whence
can he hope for salvation? whence <span id="page_63">p. 63</span> <span
id="iv.vi-Page_63"></span>to obtain pardon? Who will then successfully
intercede for us? they who are now perhaps urging us and forcibly
dragging us on? But who will save these same at such a moment? For even
they too will stand in need in their turn of intercession, that they may
escape the fire. Now, that I say not these things to frighten thee, but
as representing the matter as in truth it is, hear what the holy Apostle
Paul saith to Timothy his disciple, his own and beloved son, “Lay hands
suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men’s sins.” <span
id="fr_140"></span>[141](#fn_140.md) Dost thou not see from what great
blame, yea and vengeance, we, so far as in us lies, have delivered those
who were ready to put us forward for this office.

<span id="iv.vi-p26"></span>2. For as it is not enough for those who are
chosen to say in excuse for themselves, “I did not summon myself to this
office, nor could I avoid what I did not see beforehand;” so neither
will it be a sufficient plea for those who ordain them to say that they
did not know him who was ordained. The charge against them becomes
greater on account of their ignorance of him whom they brought forward,
and what seems to excuse them only serves to accuse them the more. For
how absurd a thing, is it not? that they who want to buy a slave, show
him to the physician, and require sureties for the sale, and information
about him from their neighbours, and after all this do not yet venture
on his purchase without asking for some time for a trial of him; while
they who are going to admit any one to so great an office as this, give
their testimonial and their sanction loosely and carelessly, without
further investigation, just because some one wishes it, or to court the
favor, or to avoid the displeasure of some one else. Who shall then
successfully intercede for us in that day, when they who ought to defend
us stand themselves in need of defenders? He who is going to ordain,
therefore, ought to make diligent inquiry, and much more he who is to be
ordained. For though they who ordain him share his punishment, for any
sins which he may commit in his office, yet so far from escaping
vengeance he will even pay a greater penalty than they—save only if they
who chose him acted from some worldly motive contrary to what seemed
justifiable to themselves. For if they should be detected so doing, and
knowing a man to be unworthy have brought him forward on some pretext or
other, the amount of their punishment shall be equivalent to his, nay
perhaps the punishment shall be even greater for them who appointed the
unfit man. For he who gives authority to any one who is minded to
destroy the Church, would be certainly to blame for the outrages which
that person commits. But if he is guilty of no such thing, and says that
he has been misled by the opinions of others, even then he shall not
altogether remain unpunished, but his punishment shall be a little
lighter than his who has been ordained. What then? It is possible that
they who elect may come to the election deceived by a false report. But
he who is elected could not say, “I am ignorant of myself,” as others
were of him. As one who will receive therefore a sorer punishment than
they who put him forward, so should he make his scrutiny of himself more
careful than that which they make of him; and if they in ignorance drag
him on, he ought to come forward and instruct them carefully about any
matters whereby he may stop their being misled; and so having shown
himself unworthy of trial may escape the burden of so high an office.

<span id="iv.vi-p27"></span>For what is the reason why, in the arts of
war, and merchandize, <span id="fr_141"></span>[142](#fn_141.md) and
husbandry, and other departments of this life, when some plan is
proposed, the husbandman will not undertake to navigate the ship, nor
the soldier to till the ground, nor the pilot to lead an army, under
pain of ten thousand deaths? Is it not plainly this? that each foresees
the danger which would attend his incompetence? Well, where the loss is
concerned with trifles shall we use so much forethought, and refuse to
yield to the pressure of compulsion, but where the punishment is
eternal, as it is for those who know not how to handle the Priesthood,
shall we want only and inconsiderately run into so great danger, and
then advance, as our excuse, the pressing entreaties of others? But He
who one day will judge us will entertain no such plea as this. For we
ought to show far more caution in spiritual matters than in carnal. But
now we are not found exhibiting as much caution. For tell me: if
supposing a man to be an artificer, when he is not so, we invited him to
do a piece of work, and he were to respond to the call, and then having
set his hand to the material prepared for the building, were to spoil
the wood and spoil the stone, and so to build the house that it
straightway fell to pieces, would it be sufficient excuse for him to
allege that he had been urged by others and did not come of his own
accord? in no wise; and very reasonably and justly so. For he ought to
have refused even at the call of others. So for the man who only spoils
wood and stone, there will be no escape from paying the penalty, and is
he who de<span id="page_64">p. 64</span> <span
id="iv.vi-Page_64"></span>stroys souls, and builds the temple of God
carelessly, to think that the compulsion of others is his warrant for
escaping punishment? Is not this very absurd? For I omit the fact as yet
that no one is able to compel the man who is unwilling. But be it that
he was subjected to excessive pressure and divers artful devices, and
then fell into a snare; will this therefore rescue him from punishment?
I beseech thee, let us not deceive ourselves, and pretend that we know
not what is obvious to a mere child. For surely this pretence of
ignorance will not be able to profit in the day of reckoning. Thou wert
not ambitious, thou sayest, of receiving this high office, conscious of
thine own weakness. Well and good. Then thou oughtest, with the same
mind, to have declined the solicitation of others; or, when no one
called thee, wast thou weak and incapable, but when those were found
ready to offer thee this dignity, didst thou suddenly become competent?
What ludicrous nonsense! worthy of the extremest punishment. For this
reason also the Lord counsels the man who wishes to build a tower, not
to lay the foundation before he has taken his own ability to build into
account, lest he should give the passers by innumerable opportunities of
mocking at him. <span id="fr_142"></span>[143](#fn_142.md) But in his case
the penalty only consists in becoming a laughing-stock; while in that
before us the punishment is that of fire unquenchable, and of an undying
worm, <span id="fr_143"></span>[144](#fn_143.md) gnashing of teeth, outer
darkness, and being cut asunder, <span id="fr_144"></span>[145](#fn_144.md)
and having a portion with the hypocrites.

<span id="iv.vi-p32"></span>But my accusers are unwilling to consider
any of these things. For otherwise they would cease to blame a person
who is unwilling to perish without cause. It is not the management of
corn and barley, oxen or sheep, that is now under our consideration, nor
any such like matters, but the very Body of Jesus. For the Church of
Christ, according to St. Paul, is Christ’s Body, <span
id="fr_145"></span>[146](#fn_145.md) and he who is entrusted with its care
ought to train it up to a state of healthiness, and beauty unspeakable,
and to look everywhere, lest any spot or wrinkle, <span
id="fr_146"></span>[147](#fn_146.md) or other like blemish should mar its
vigor and comeliness. For what is this but to make it appear worthy, so
far as human power can, of the incorruptible and ever-blessed Head which
is set over it? If they who are ambitious of reaching an athletic
condition of body need the help of physicians and trainers, <span
id="fr_147"></span>[148](#fn_147.md) and exact diet, and constant exercise,
and a thousand other rules (for the omission of the merest trifle upsets
and spoils the whole), how shall they to whose lot falls the care of the
body, which has its conflict not against flesh and blood, but against
powers unseen, be able to keep it sound and healthy, unless they far
surpass ordinary human virtue, and are versed in all healing proper for
the soul?

<span id="iv.vi-p36"></span>3. Pray, art thou not aware that that body
is subject to more diseases and assaults than this flesh of ours, is
more quickly corrupted, and more slow to recover? and by those who have
the healing of these bodies, divers medicines have been discovered, and
an apparatus of different instruments, and diet suitable for the sick;
and often the condition of the atmosphere is of itself enough for the
recovery of a sick man; and there are instances of seasonable sleep
having saved the physician all further labor. But in the case before us,
it is impossible to take any of these things into consideration; nay
there is but one method and way of healing appointed, after we have gone
wrong, and that is, the powerful application of the Word. This is the
one instrument, the only diet, the finest atmosphere. This takes the
place of physic, cautery and cutting, and if it be needful to sear and
amputate, this is the means which we must use, and if this be of no
avail, all else is wasted; with this we both rouse the soul when it
sleeps, and reduce it when it is inflamed; with this we cut off
excesses, and fill up defects, and perform all manner of other
operations which are requisite for the soul’s health. Now as regards the
ordering of our daily life for the best, it is true that the life of
another may provoke us to emulation. But in the matter of spurious
doctrine, when any soul is diseased thereby, then there is great need of
the Word, not only in view of the safety of our own people, but in view
of the enemy without. If, indeed, one had the sword of the spirit, and
the shield of faith, <span id="fr_148"></span>[149](#fn_148.md) so as to be
able to work miracles, and by means of these marvels to stop the mouths
of impudent gainsayers, one would have little need of the assistance of
the Word; still in the days of miracles the Word was by no means
useless, but essentially necessary. For St. Paul made use of it himself,
although he was everywhere so great an object of wonder for his
miracles; and another <span id="fr_149"></span>[150](#fn_149.md) of those
who belonged to the “glorious company of the Apostles” exhorts us to
apply ourselves to acquiring this power, when he says: “Be ready always
to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason concerning the
hope that <span id="page_65">p. 65</span> <span
id="iv.vi-Page_65"></span>is in you,” and they all, with one accord,
committed the care of the poor widows to Stephen, for no other reason
than that they themselves might have leisure “for the ministry of the
Word.” <span id="fr_150"></span>[151](#fn_150.md) To this we ought equally
to apply ourselves, unless indeed we are endued with a power of working
miracles. But if there is not the least sign of such a power being left
us, while on every side many enemies are constantly attacking us, why
then it necessarily follows that we should arm ourselves with this
weapon, both in order that we may not be wounded ourselves with the
darts of the enemy, and in order that we may wound him.

<span id="iv.vi-p40"></span>4. Wherefore it should be our ambition that
the Word of Christ dwell in us richly. <span
id="fr_151"></span>[152](#fn_151.md) For it is not for one kind of battle
only that we have to be prepared. This warfare is manifold, and is
engaged with a great variety of enemies; neither do all these use the
same weapons, nor do they practice the same method of attack; and he who
has to join battle with all, must needs know the artifices of all, and
be at once both archer and slinger, captain and general, in the ranks
and in command, on foot and on horseback, in sea-fight and in siege. In
common warfare, indeed, each man repels the enemy by discharging the
particular duty which he has undertaken. But here it is otherwise; and
if any one wishes to come off conqueror in this warfare, he must
understand all forms of the art, as the devil knows well how to
introduce his own assailants through any one spot which may happen to be
unguarded, and to carry off the sheep. But not so where he perceives the
shepherd coming equipped with accurate knowledge at all points, and well
acquainted with his plottings. Wherefore we ought to be well-guarded in
all parts: for a city, so long as it happens to be surrounded with a
wall, laughs to scorn the besiegers, abiding in great security; but if
any one makes a breach in the wall, though but of the size of a gate,
the rest of the circuit is of no use, although the whole of it stand
quite securely; so it is with the city of God: so long as the presence
of mind and wisdom of the shepherd, which answers to the wall, protect
it on all sides, all the enemy’s devices end in his confusion and
ridicule, and they who dwell within the wall abide unmolested, but
wherever any one has been able to demolish a single part, though the
rest stand never so fast, through that breach ruin will enter upon the
whole. For to what purpose does a man contend earnestly with the Greeks,
if at the same time he becomes a prey to the Jews? or get the better of
both these and then fall into the clutches of the Manichæans? <span
id="fr_152"></span>[153](#fn_152.md) or after he has proved himself
superior to them even, if they who introduce fatalism <span
id="fr_153"></span>[154](#fn_153.md) enter in, and make havoc of the flock?
But not to enumerate all the heresies of the devil, it will be enough to
say that unless the shepherd is well skilled in refuting them all, the
wolf, by means of any one of them, can enter, and devour the greater
part of the flock. In ordinary warfare we must always look for victory
being won or defeat sustained by the soldiers who are on the field of
battle. But in the spiritual warfare the case is quite different. For
there it often happens that the combat with one set of enemies secures a
victory for others who never engaged in battle at all, nor took any
trouble, but were sitting still all the while; and he who has not much
experience in such occurrences will get pierced, so to say, with his own
sword, and become the laughing-stock of friends and foes alike. I will
try by an example to make clear what I am saying. They who receive the
wild doctrines of Valentinus and Marcion, <span
id="fr_154"></span>[155](#fn_154.md) and of all whose minds are similarly
diseased, exclude the Law given by God to Moses from the catalogue of
the Divine Scriptures. But Jews so revere the Law, that although the
time has come which annuls it, they still contend for the observance of
all its contents, contrary to the purpose of God. But the Church of God,
avoiding either extreme, has trodden a middle path, and is neither
induced on the one hand to place herself under its yoke, nor on the
other does she tolerate its being slandered, but commends it, though its
day is over, because of its profitableness while its season lasted. Now
it is necessary for him who is going to fight with both these
enemies, <span id="fr_155"></span>[156](#fn_155.md) to be fully conversant
with this middle course. For if in wishing to teach the Jews that they
are out of date in clinging to the old law, he begins to find fault with
it unsparingly, he gives no little handle to those heretics who wish to
pull it to pieces; and if in his ambition to stop their mouths he extols
it immoderately, and speaks of it with admiration, as <span
id="page_66">p. 66</span> <span id="iv.vi-Page_66"></span>necessary for
this present time, he unseals the lips of the Jews. Again they who labor
under the frenzy of Sabellius and the craze of Arius, <span
id="fr_156"></span>[157](#fn_156.md) have both fallen from a sound faith
for want of observing a middle course. The name of Christian is applied
to both these heretics; but if any one examines their doctrines, he will
find the one sect not much better than the Jews, and differing from them
only in name, and the other <span id="fr_157"></span>[158](#fn_157.md) very
nearly holding the heresy of Paul of Samosata, <span
id="fr_158"></span>[159](#fn_158.md) and that both are very wide of the
truth. Great, therefore, is the danger in such cases, and the way of
orthodoxy is narrow and hemmed in by threatening crags on either side,
and there is no little fear lest when intending to strike at one enemy
we should be wounded by the other. For if any one assert the unity of
the Godhead, Sabellius straightway turns that expression to the
advantage of his own mental vagary, <span
id="fr_159"></span>[160](#fn_159.md) and if he distinguish the Persons, and
say that the Father is one, and the Son another, and the Holy Spirit a
third, up gets Arius, ready to wrest that distinction of Persons into a
difference of substance; <span id="fr_160"></span>[161](#fn_160.md) so we
must turn and flee both from the impious confounding of the Persons by
the one, and the senseless division of the substance by the other,
confessing, indeed, that the Godhead of the Father and of the Son and of
the Holy Ghost, is all one, while we add thereunto a Trinity of Persons.
For then we shall be able to fortify ourselves against the attacks of
both heretics. I might tell thee besides these, of several other
adversaries against which, except we contend bravely and carefully, we
shall leave the field covered with wounds.

<span id="iv.vi-p51"></span>5. Why should any one describe the silly
chatter of our own people? For these are not less than the attacks upon
us from without, while they give the teacher even more trouble. Some out
of an idle curiosity are rashly bent upon busying themselves about
matters which are neither possible for them to know, nor of any
advantage to them if they could know them. Others again demand from God
an account of his judgments, and force themselves to sound the depth of
that abyss which is unfathomable. “For thy judgments,” saith the
Scriptures, “are a great deep,” <span id="fr_161"></span>[162](#fn_161.md)
and about their faith and practice thou wouldest find few of them
anxious, but the majority curiously inquiring into matters which it is
not possible to discover, and the mere inquiry into which provokes God.
For when we make a determined effort to learn what *He* does not wish us
to know, we fail to succeed (for how should we succeed against the will
of God?); and there only remains for us the danger arising from our
inquiry. Now, though this be the case, whenever any one authoritatively
stops the search, into such fathomless depths, he gets himself the
reputation of being proud and ignorant; so that at such times much tact
is needed on the Bishop’s part, so as to lead his people away from these
unprofitable questions, and himself escape the above-named censures. In
short, to meet all these difficulties, there is no help given but that
of speech, and if any be destitute of this power, the souls of those who
are put under his charge (I mean of the weaker and more meddlesome kind)
are no better off than ships continually storm-tossed. So that the
Priest should do all that in him lies, to gain this means of strength.

<span id="iv.vi-p53"></span>6. <span class="c12"><span
id="iv.vi-p53.1"></span>Basil</span>: “Why, then, was not St. Paul
ambitious of becoming perfect in this art? He makes no secret of his
poverty of speech, but distinctly confesses himself to be unskilled,
even telling the Corinthians so, <span id="fr_162"></span>[163](#fn_162.md)
who were admired for their eloquence, and prided themselves upon it.”

<span id="iv.vi-p55"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.vi-p55.1"></span>Chrysostom</span>: This is the very thing which
has ruined many and made them remiss in the study of true doctrine. For
while they failed to fathom the depths of the apostle’s mind, and to
understand the meaning of his words, they passed all their time
slumbering and yawning, and paying respect not to that ignorance which
St. Paul acknowledges, but to a kind from which he was as free as any
man ever was in the world.

<span id="iv.vi-p56"></span>But leaving this subject to await our
consideration, I say this much in the meantime. Granting that St. Paul
was in this respect as unskilled as they would have him to be, what has
that to do with the men of to-day? For he had a greater power by far
than power of speech, power which brought about greater results too;
which was that his bare presence, even though he was silent, was
terrible to the <span id="page_67">p. 67</span> <span
id="iv.vi-Page_67"></span>demons. But the men of the present day, if
they were all collected in one place, would not be able, with infinite
prayers and tears, to do the wonders that once were done by the
handkerchief of St. Paul. He too by his prayers raised the dead, <span
id="fr_163"></span>[164](#fn_163.md) and wrought such other miracles, that
he was held to be a god by heathen; <span
id="fr_164"></span>[165](#fn_164.md) and before he was removed from this
life, he was thought worthy to be caught up as far as the third heaven,
and to share in such converse as it is not lawful for mortal ears to
hear. <span id="fr_165"></span>[166](#fn_165.md) But the men of to-day—not
that I would say anything harsh or severe, for indeed I do not speak by
way of insult to them, but only in wonder—how is it that they do not
shudder when they measure themselves with so great a man as this? For if
we leave the miracles and turn to the life of this blessed saint, and
look into his angelic conversation, it is in this rather than in his
miracles that thou wilt find this Christian athlete a conqueror. For how
can one describe his zeal and forbearance, his constant perils, his
continual cares, and incessant anxiety for the Churches; his sympathy
with the weak, his many afflictions, his unwonted persecutions, his
deaths daily? Where is the spot in the world, where is the continent or
sea, that is a stranger to the labours of this righteous man? Even the
desert has known his presence, for it often sheltered him in time of
danger. For he underwent every species of attack, and achieved every
kind of victory, and there was never any end to his contests and his
triumphs.

<span id="iv.vi-p60"></span>Yet, all unawares, I have been led to do
this man an injury. For his exploits are beyond all powers of
description, and beyond mine in particular, just as the masters of
eloquence surpass me. Nevertheless, since that holy apostle will judge
us, not by the issue, but by the motive, I shall not forbear till I have
stated one more circumstance which surpasses anything yet mentioned, as
much as he himself surpasses all his fellow men. And what is this? After
so many exploits, after such a multitude of victories, he prayed that he
might go into hell, and be handed over to eternal punishment, if so be
that those Jews, who had often stoned him, and done what they could to
make away with him, might be saved, and come over to Christ. <span
id="fr_166"></span>[167](#fn_166.md) Now who so longed for Christ? If,
indeed, his feelings towards him ought not to be described as something
nobler than longing; shall we then any more compare ourselves with this
saint, after so great grace was imparted to him from above, after so
great virtue was manifested in himself? What could be more presumptuous?

<span id="iv.vi-p62"></span>Now, that he was not so unskilled, as some
count him to be, I shall try to show in what follows. The unskilled
person in men’s estimation is not only one who is unpracticed in the
tricks of profane oratory, <span id="fr_167"></span>[168](#fn_167.md) but
the man who is incapable of contending for the defence of the right
faith, and they are right. But St. Paul did not say that he was
unskilled in both these respects, but in one only; and in support of
this he makes a careful distinction, saying that he was “rude in speech,
but not in knowledge.” <span id="fr_168"></span>[169](#fn_168.md) Now were
I to insist upon the polish of Isocrates, the weight of Demosthenes, the
dignity of Thucydides, and the sublimity of Plato, in any one bishop,
St. Paul would be a strong evidence against me. But I pass by all such
matters and the elaborate ornaments of profane oratory; and I take no
account of style or of delivery; yea let a man’s diction be poor and his
composition simple and unadorned, but let him not be unskilled in the
knowledge and accurate statement of doctrine; nor in order to screen his
own sloth, deprive that holy apostle of the greatest of his gifts, and
the sum of his praises.

<span id="iv.vi-p65"></span>7. For how was it, tell me, that he
confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damascus, <span
id="fr_169"></span>[170](#fn_169.md) though he had not yet begun to work
miracles? How was it that he wrestled with the Grecians and threw
them? <span id="fr_170"></span>[171](#fn_170.md) and why was he sent to
Tarsus? Was it not because he was so mighty and victorious in the word,
and brought his adversaries to such a pass that they, unable to brook
their defeat, were provoked to seek his life? At that time, as I said,
he had not begun to work miracles, nor could any one say that the masses
looked upon him with astonishment on account of any glory belonging to
his mighty works, or that they who contended with him were overpowered
by the force of public opinion concerning him. For at this time he
conquered by dint of argument only. How was it, moreover, that he
contended and disputed successfully with those who tried to Judaize in
Antioch? and how was it that that Areopagite, <span
id="fr_171"></span>[172](#fn_171.md) an inhabitant of Athens, that most
devoted of all cities to the gods, followed the apostle, he and his
wife? was it not owing to the discourse which they heard? And when
Eutychus <span id="fr_172"></span>[173](#fn_172.md) fell from the lattice,
was it not owing to his long attendance even until midnight to St.
Paul’s preaching? How do we find him employed at Thessalonica and
Corinth, in Ephesus and in Rome itself? Did he not spend whole nights
and days in interpreting the Scriptures in their order? and <span
id="page_68">p. 68</span> <span id="iv.vi-Page_68"></span>why should any
one recount his disputes with the Epicureans and Stoics. <span
id="fr_173"></span>[174](#fn_173.md) For were we resolved to enter into
every particular, our story would grow to an unreasonable length.

<span id="iv.vi-p71"></span>When, therefore, both before working
miracles, and after, St. Paul appears to have made much use of argument,
how can any one dare to pronounce him unskillful whose sermons and
disputations were so exceedingly admired by all who heard them? Why did
the Lycaonians <span id="fr_174"></span>[175](#fn_174.md) imagine that he
was Hermes? The opinion that he and Barnabas were gods indeed, arose out
of the sight of their miracles; but the notion that he was Hermes did
not arise from this, but was a consequence of his speech. In what else
did this blessed saint excel the rest of the apostles? and how comes it
that up and down the world he is so much on every one’s tongue? How
comes it that not merely among ourselves, but also among Jews and
Greeks, he is the wonder of wonders? Is it not from the power of his
epistles? whereby not only to the faithful of to-day, but from his time
to this, yea and up to the end, even the appearing of Christ, he has
been and will be profitable, and will continue to be so as long as the
human race shall last. For as a wall built of adamant, so his writings
fortify all the Churches of the known world, and he as a most noble
champion stands in the midst, bringing into captivity every thought to
the obedience of Christ, casting down imaginations, and every high thing
which exalts itself against the knowledge of God, <span
id="fr_175"></span>[176](#fn_175.md) and all this he does by those epistles
which he has left to us full of wonders and of Divine wisdom. For his
writings are not only useful to us, for the overthrow of false doctrine
and the confirmation of the true, but they help not a little towards
living a good life. For by the use of these, the bishops of the present
day fit and fashion the chaste virgin, which St. Paul himself espoused
to Christ, <span id="fr_176"></span>[177](#fn_176.md) and conduct her to
the state of spiritual beauty; with these, too, they drive away from her
the noisome pestilences which beset her, and preserve the good health
thus obtained. Such are the medicines and such their efficacy left us by
this so-called unskillful man, and they know them and their power best
who constantly use them. From all this it is evident that St. Paul had
given himself to the study of which we have been speaking with great
diligence and zeal.

<span id="iv.vi-p75"></span>8. Hear also what he says in his charge to
his disciple: <span id="fr_177"></span>[178](#fn_177.md) “Give heed to
reading, to exhortation, to teaching,” and he goes on to show the
usefulness of this by adding, “For in doing this thou shalt save both
thyself and them that hear thee.” <span
id="fr_178"></span>[179](#fn_178.md) And again he says, “The Lord’s servant
must not strive, but be gentle towards all, apt to teach,
forbearing;” <span id="fr_179"></span>[180](#fn_179.md) and he proceeds to
say, “But abide thou in the things which thou hast learned, and hast
been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them, and that from a
babe thou hast known the sacred writings which are able to make thee
wise unto salvation,” <span id="fr_180"></span>[181](#fn_180.md) and again,
“Every Scripture is inspired of God, and also profitable for teaching,
for reproof, for correction, for instruction which is in righteousness,
that the man of God may be complete.” <span
id="fr_181"></span>[182](#fn_181.md) Hear what he adds further in his
directions to Titus about the appointment of bishops. “The bishop,” he
says, “must be holding to the faithful word which is according to the
teaching, that he may be able to convict the gainsayers.” <span
id="fr_182"></span>[183](#fn_182.md) But how shall any one who is
unskillful as these men pretend, be able to convict the gainsayers and
stop their mouths? or what need is there to give attention to reading
and to the Holy Scriptures, if such a state of unskillfulness is to be
welcome among us? Such arguments are mere makeshifts and pretexts, the
marks of idleness and sloth. But some one will say, “it is to the
priests that these charges are given:”—certainly, for they are the
subjects of our discourse. But that the apostle gives the same charge to
the laity, hear what he says in another epistle to other than the
priesthood: “Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all
wisdom,” <span id="fr_183"></span>[184](#fn_183.md) and again, “Let your
speech be always with grace seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye
ought to answer each one,” <span id="fr_184"></span>[185](#fn_184.md) and
there is a general charge to all that they “be ready to” <span
id="fr_185"></span>[186](#fn_185.md) render an account of their faith, and
to the Thessalonians, he gives the following command: “Build each other
up, even as also ye do.” <span id="fr_186"></span>[187](#fn_186.md) But
when he speaks of priests he says, “Let the elders that rule well be
counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in the word,
and in teaching.” <span id="fr_187"></span>[188](#fn_187.md) For this is
the perfection of teaching when the teachers both by what they do, and
by what they say as well, bring their disciples to that blessed state of
life which Christ appointed for them. For example alone is not enough to
instruct others. Nor do I say this of myself; it is our Saviour’s own
word. “For whosoever shall do and teach them, he shall be called
great. <span id="fr_188"></span>[189](#fn_188.md) Now if doing were the
same as teaching, the second word here would be superfluous; and it had
been enough to have said “whosoever shall <span id="page_69">p.
69</span> <span id="iv.vi-Page_69"></span>do” simply. But now by
distinguishing the two, he shows that practice is one thing, and
doctrine another, and that each needs the help of the others in order to
complete edification. Thou hearest too what the chosen vessel of Christ
says to the Ephesian elders: “Wherefore watch ye, remembering that for
the space of three years, I ceased not to admonish every one, night and
day, with tears.” <span id="fr_189"></span>[190](#fn_189.md) But what need
was there for his tears or for admonition by word of mouth, while his
life as an apostle was so illustrious? His holy life might be a great
inducement to men to keep the commandments, yet I dare not say that it
alone could accomplish everything.

<span id="iv.vi-p89"></span>9. But when a dispute arises concerning
matters of doctrine, and all take their weapons from the same
Scriptures, of what weight will any one’s life be able to prove? What
then will be the good of his many austerities, when after such painful
exercises, any one from the Priest’s great unskillfulness in argument
fall into heresy, and be cut off from the body of the Church, a
misfortune which I have myself seen many suffering. Of what profit then
will his patience be to him? None; no more than there will be in a sound
faith if the life is corrupt. Wherefore, for this reason more than for
all others, it concerns him whose office it is to teach others, to be
experienced in disputations of this kind. For though he himself stands
safely, and is unhurt by the gainsayers, yet the simple multitude under
his direction, when they see their leader defeated, and without any
answer for the gainsayers, will be apt to lay the blame of his
discomfiture not on his own weakness, but on the doctrines themselves,
as though they were faulty; and so by reason of the inexperience of one,
great numbers are brought to extreme ruin; for though they do not
entirely go over to the adversary, yet they are forced to doubt about
matters in which formerly they firmly believed, and those whom they used
to approach with unswerving confidence, they are unable to hold to any
longer steadfastly, but in consequence of their leader’s defeat, so
great a storm settles down upon their souls, that the mischief ends in
their shipwreck altogether. But how dire is the destruction, and how
terrible the fire which such a leader brings upon his own wretched head
for every soul which is thus lost, thou wilt not need to learn from me,
as thou knowest all this perfectly. Is this then pride, is this
vainglory in me, to be unwilling to be the cause of the destruction of
so many souls? and of procuring for myself greater punishment in the
world to come, than that which now awaits me there? Who would say so?
surely no one, unless he should wish to find fault where there is none,
and to moralize over other men’s calamities.

<span id="iv.vi-p42"></span> The followers of Manes, or Manichæus, who
was born about 240 A.D. He taught that God was the cause of good, and
matter the cause of evil. This theory about matter led him to hold that
the body of Jesus was an incorporeal phantom. He eliminated the Old
Testament from the Scriptures, and held himself at liberty also to
reject such passages in the New Testament as were opposed to his own
opinions. See Robertson: Hist. of the Christian Church, vol. i. 139–145.

<span id="iv.vi-p44"></span> Marcion and Valentinus (A.D. 140) were each
founders of a form of Gnosticism. Each held that the God of the Old
Testament was morally contrary to the God of the New: while the system
of Valentinus represented the imaginative and speculative side of
Gnosticism, that of Marcion represented its practical side, and was
rather religious than theological. The sect of the Valentinians lasted
as late as the 5th century; and Marcionism was not extinct till the 6th.

<span id="iv.vi-p46"></span> Sabellius was condemned in a Council held
in Rome, A.D. 263, for holding that there is but one person in the
Godhead, and that the Word and Holy Spirit are only virtues or
emanations of the Deity. Arius held that our Lord Jesus Christ existed
before His Incarnation, that by Him as by an instrument the Supreme God
made the worlds, and that as being the most ancient and the highest of
created beings, He is to be worshipped; but that He had a beginning of
existence, and so is not God’s co-eternally begotten Son, nor of the
very substance of the Supreme God. See Liddon, Bampton Lectures, i. p.
25. The heresy of Arius was condemned at the Council of Nicæa, A.D. 325.

<span id="iv.vi-p48"></span> Paul of Samosata was appointed Bishop of
Antioch about 260 A.D. The Humanitarian movement culminated in his
teaching, which maintained that the Word was only in the Father, as
reason is in man; that Jesus was a mere man, and that he is called Son
of God as having, in a certain sense, become such through the influence
of the Divine Word which dwelt in him, but without any personal union.
