<span id="xix.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c17"><span
id="xix.xiv-p1.1"></span>Homily XII.</span>

<span id="xix.xiv-p2"></span>Thanksgiving to God for the pardon granted
to the offenders against the Emperor. Physical discourse on the
Creation. Proof that God, in creating man, implanted in him a natural
law. Duty of avoiding oaths with the utmost diligence.

<span id="xix.xiv-p3"></span>1. <span class="c12"><span
id="xix.xiv-p3.1"></span>Yesterday</span> I said “Blessed be God!” and
to-day again I say the very same thing. For although the evils we
dreaded have passed away, we should not suffer the memory of them to
disappear; not indeed that we may grieve, but that we may give thanks.
For if the memory of these terrors abide with us, we shall never be
overtaken by the actual experience of such terrors. For what need have
we of the experience, whilst our memory acts the part of a monitor?
Seeing then that God hath not permitted us to be overwhelmed in the
flood of those troubles when upon us, let us not permit ourselves to
become careless when these are passed away. Then, when we were sad, He
consoled us, let us give thanks to Him now that we are joyful. In our
agony He comforted us, and did not forsake us; therefore let us not
betray ourselves in prosperity by declining into sloth. “Forget not,”
saith one, “the time of famine in the day of plenty.” <span
id="fr_1496"></span>[1497](#fn_1496.md) Therefore let us be mindful of the
time of temptation in the day of relief; and with respect to our sins
let us also act in the same manner. If thou hast sinned, and God hath
pardoned thy sin, receive thy pardon, and give thanks; but be not
forgetful of the sin; not that thou shouldest fret thyself with the
thought of it, but that thou mayest school thy soul, not to grow wanton,
and relapse again into the same snares. <span
id="fr_1497"></span>[1498](#fn_1497.md)

<span id="xix.xiv-p6"></span>2. Thus also Paul did; for having said, “He
counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry,” he goes on to add,
“who was before a blasphemer, a persecutor, and injurious.” <span
id="fr_1498"></span>[1499](#fn_1498.md) “Let the life of the servant,”
saith he, “be openly exposed, so that the lovingkindness of the Master
be apparent. For although I have received the remission of sins, I do
not reject the memory of those sins.” And this not only manifested the
lovingkindness of the Lord, but made the man himself the more
illustrious. For when thou hast learnt who he was before, then thou wilt
be the more astonished at him; and when thou seest out of what he came
to be what he was, then thou wilt commend him the more; and if thou hast
greatly sinned, yet upon being changed thou wilt conceive favourable
hopes from this instance. For in addition to what has been said, such an
example comforts those who are in despair, and causes them again to
stand erect. The same thing also will be the case with regard to our
city; for all the events that have happened serve to shew your virtue,
who by means of repentance have prevailed to ward off such wrath, whilst
at the same time they proclaim the lovingkindness of God, who has
removed the cloud that was so threatening, in consequence of a small
change of conduct, and so raises up again all those who are sunk in
despair, when they learn, from our case, that <span id="page_419">p.
419</span> <span id="xix.xiv-Page_419"></span>he who looks upward for
the Divine help, is not to be overwhelmed, though innumerable waves
should encompass him on all sides.

<span id="xix.xiv-p8"></span>3. For who hath seen, who hath ever heard
of sufferings such as were ours? We were every day in expectation that
our city would be overturned from its foundations together with its
inhabitants. But when the Devil was hoping to sink the vessel, then God
produced a perfect calm. Let us not then be unmindful of the greatness
of these terrors, in order that we may remember the magnitude of the
benefits received from God. He who knows not the nature of the disease
will not understand the physician’s art. Let us tell these things also
to our children; and transmit them to the remotest generations, that all
may learn how the Devil had endeavoured to destroy the very foundation
of the city; and how God was able visibly to raise it up again, when it
was fallen and prostrate; and did not permit even the least injury to
befall it, but took away the fear; and dispelled with much speed the
peril it had been placed in. For even through the past week we were all
expecting that our substance would be confiscated; and that soldiers
would have been let loose upon us; and we were dreaming of a thousand
other horrors. But lo! all these things have passed away, even like a
cloud or a flitting shadow; and we have been punished only in the
expectation of what is dreadful; or rather we have not been punished,
but we have been disciplined, and have become better; God having
softened the heart of the Emperor. Let us then always and every day say,
“Blessed be God!” and with greater zeal let us give heed to our
assembling, and let us hasten to the church, from whence we have reaped
this benefit. For ye know whither ye fled at the first; whither ye
flocked together; and from what quarter our safety came. Let us then
hold fast by this sacred anchor; and as in the season of danger it did
not betray us, so now let us not leave it in the season of relief; but
let us await with exact attention the stated assemblies and prayers; and
let us every day give a hearing to the divine oracles. And the leisure
which we spent in busily running about after those who came from the
court, <span id="fr_1499"></span>[1500](#fn_1499.md) whilst we were
labouring under anxiety in respect to the evils that threatened us; this
let us consume wholly in hearing the divine laws, instead of
unseasonable and senseless pastimes; lest we should again reduce
ourselves to the necessity of that sort of occupation. <span
id="fr_1500"></span>[1501](#fn_1500.md)

<span id="xix.xiv-p11"></span>4. On the three foregoing days, then, we
have investigated one method of acquiring the knowledge of God, and have
brought it to a conclusion; explaining how “the heavens declare the
glory of God;” <span id="fr_1501"></span>[1502](#fn_1501.md) and what the
meaning of that is, which is said by Paul; viz. “That the invisible
things of Him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being
understood by the things that are made.” <span
id="fr_1502"></span>[1503](#fn_1502.md) And we shewed how from the creation
of the world, and how by heaven, and earth, the sea, the Creator is
glorified. But to-day, after briefly philosophising on that same
subject, we will proceed to another topic. For He not only made
it, <span id="fr_1503"></span>[1504](#fn_1503.md) but provided also that
when it was made, it should carry on its operations; not permitting it
to be all immoveable, nor commanding it to be all in a state of motion.
The heaven, for instance, hath remained immoveable, according as the
prophet says, “He placed the heaven as a vault, and stretched it out as
a tent over the earth.” <span id="fr_1504"></span>[1505](#fn_1504.md) But,
on the other hand, the sun with the rest of the stars, runs on his
course through every day. <span id="fr_1505"></span>[1506](#fn_1505.md) And
again, the earth is fixed, but the waters are continually in motion; and
not the waters only, but the clouds, and the frequent and successive
showers, which return at their proper season. The nature of the clouds
is one, but the things which are produced out of them are different. For
the rain, indeed, becomes wine in the grape, but oil in the olive. And
in other plants is changed into their juices; and the womb of the earth
is one, and yet bears different fruits. The heat, too, of the sun-beams
is one, but it ripens all things differently; bringing some to maturity
more slowly, and others more quickly. Who then but must feel
astonishment and admiration at these things?

<span id="xix.xiv-p17"></span>5. Nay, this is not the only wonder, that
He hath formed it with this great variety and diversity; but farther,
that He hath spread it before all in common; the rich and the poor,
sinners as well as the righteous. Even as Christ also declared: “He
maketh His sun to rise upon the evil and the good, and sendeth His rain
upon the just and unjust.” <span id="fr_1506"></span>[1507](#fn_1506.md)
Moreover, when He stocked the world with various animals, and implanted
divers dispositions in the creatures, He commanded us to imitate some of
these, and to avoid others. For example; the ant is industrious, and
per<span id="page_420">p. 420</span> <span
id="xix.xiv-Page_420"></span>forms a laborious task. By giving heed
then, thou wilt receive the strongest admonition from this animal not to
indulge in sloth, nor to shun labour and toil. Therefore also the
Scripture has sent the sluggard to the ant, saying, “Go to the ant, thou
sluggard, emulate his ways, and be wiser than he.” <span
id="fr_1507"></span>[1508](#fn_1507.md) Art thou unwilling, he means, to
learn from the Scriptures, that it is good to labour, and that he who
will not work, neither ought he to eat? <span
id="fr_1508"></span>[1509](#fn_1508.md) learn it from the irrationals! This
also we do in our families, when those who are older, and who are
considered superior, have done amiss, we bid them to attend to
thoughtful children. We say, “Mark such an one, who is less than you,
how earnest and watchful he is.” Do thou then likewise receive from this
animal the best exhortation to industry; and marvel at thy Lord, not
only because He hath made heaven and the sun, but because He hath also
made the ant. For although the animal be small, it affords much proof of
the greatness of God’s wisdom. Consider then how prudent the ant is, and
consider how God hath implanted in so small a body, such an unceasing
desire of working! But whilst from this animal thou learnest industry;
take from the bee at once a lesson of neatness, industry, and social
concord! For it is not more for herself <span
id="fr_1509"></span>[1510](#fn_1509.md) than for us, that the bee labours,
and toils every day; which is indeed a thing especially proper for a
Christian; not to seek his own things, but the things of others. As then
she traverses all the meadows that she may prepare a banquet for
another, so also, O man, do thou likewise; and if thou hast accumulated
wealth, expend it upon others; if thou hast the faculty of
teaching, <span id="fr_1510"></span>[1511](#fn_1510.md) do not bury the
talent, but bring it out publicly for the sake of those who need it! Or
if thou hast any other advantage, become useful to those who require the
benefit of thy labours! Seest thou not that for this reason, especially,
the bee is more honoured than the other animals; not because she
labours, but because she labours for others? For the spider also
labours, and toils, and spreads out his fine textures over the walls,
surpassing the utmost skill of woman; but the creature is without
estimation, since his work is in no way profitable to us; such are they
that labour and toil, but for themselves! Imitate too the simplicity of
the dove! Imitate the ass in his love to his master, and the ox also!
Imitate the birds in their freedom from anxiety! For great, great indeed
is the advantage that may be gained from irrational creatures for the
correction of manners.

<span id="xix.xiv-p23"></span>6. From these animals Christ also
instructs us, when He says, “Be ye wise as serpents, and harmless as
doves.” <span id="fr_1511"></span>[1512](#fn_1511.md) And again; “Behold
the fowls of the air, for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather
into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them.” <span
id="fr_1512"></span>[1513](#fn_1512.md) The prophet also, to shame the
ungrateful Jews, thus speaks; “The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his
master’s crib; but Israel doth not know me.” <span
id="fr_1513"></span>[1514](#fn_1513.md) And again; “The turtle and the
swallow and the crane observe the time of their coming, but my people
knoweth not the judgment of the Lord his God.” <span
id="fr_1514"></span>[1515](#fn_1514.md) From these animals, and such as
these, learn to achieve virtue, and be instructed to avoid wickedness by
the contrary ones. For as the bee followeth good, so the asp is
destructive. Therefore shun wickedness, lest thou hear it said, “The
poison of asps is under their lips.” <span
id="fr_1515"></span>[1516](#fn_1515.md) Again, the dog is devoid of shame.
Hate, therefore, this kind of wickedness. The fox also is crafty, and
fraudulent. Emulate not this vice; but as the bee, in flying over the
meadows, does not choose every sort of flower; <span
id="fr_1516"></span>[1517](#fn_1516.md) but selecting that which is useful,
leaves the rest; so also do thou; and whilst surveying the whole race of
irrational animals, if any thing profitable may be drawn from these,
accept it; the advantages which they have naturally, make it thy
business to practise of thine own free choice. For in this respect also
thou hast been honoured of God; that what they have as natural
advantages He hath permitted thee to achieve of thy own free choice, in
order that thou mayest also receive a reward. For good works with them
spring not from free will, and reason, but from nature only. In other
words, the bee makes honey, not because it has learnt this by reason and
reflection, but because it is instructed by nature. Because if the work
had not been natural, and allotted to the race, some of them assuredly
would have been unskilled in their art; whereas from the time that the
world was first made, even to the present day, no one hath observed bees
resting from labour, and not making honey. For such natural
characteristics are common to the whole race. But those things which
depend on our free choice are not common; for labour is necessary that
they may be accomplished.

<span id="xix.xiv-p30"></span>7. Take then all the best things, and
clothe thyself with them; for thou art indeed king of the irrationals;
but kings, if there be any <span id="page_421">p. 421</span> <span
id="xix.xiv-Page_421"></span>thing excellent possessed by their
subjects, be it gold or silver, or precious stones, or sumptuous
vestments, usually possess the same in greater abundance. From the
creation also, learn to admire thy Lord! And if any of the things thou
seest exceed thy comprehension, and thou art not able to find the reason
thereof, yet for this glorify the Creator, that the wisdom of these
works surpasses thine understanding. Say not, wherefore is this? or, to
what end? for everything is useful, even if we know not the reason of
it. As therefore, if thou goest into a surgery, and seest many
instruments lying before thee, thou wonderest at the variety of the
implements though ignorant of their use; so also act with respect to the
creation. Although thou seest many of the animals, and of the herbs, and
plants, and other things, of which thou knowest not the use, admire the
variety of these; and feel astonishment for this reason at the perfect
workmanship of God; that He hath neither made all things manifest to
thee, nor permitted all things to be unknown. For He hath not permitted
all things to be unknown, lest thou shouldest say, that the things that
exist are not of providence. He hath not permitted all things to be
known to thee, lest the greatness of thy knowledge should excite thee to
pride. Thus at least it was that the evil demon precipitated <span
id="fr_1517"></span>[1518](#fn_1517.md) the first man headlong and by means
of the hope of greater knowledge, deprived him of that he already
possessed. Therefore also, a certain wise man exhorts, saying, “Seek not
out the things that are too hard for thee; neither search the things
that are too deep for thee. But what is commanded thee, think thereupon
with reverence; for the greater part of His works are done in
secret.” <span id="fr_1518"></span>[1519](#fn_1518.md) And again; “More
things are shewed unto thee than men understand.” But this he speaks for
the purpose of consoling the man who is sad and vexed, because he does
not know all things; for even those things he observes, which thou art
permitted to know, greatly surpass thine understanding; for thou
couldest not have found them by thyself, but thou hast been taught them
of God. Wherefore be content with the wealth given thee, and do not seek
more; but for what thou hast received give thanks; and do not be angry
on account of those things which thou hast not received. And, for what
thou knowest, give glory, and do not stumble at those things of which
thou art ignorant. For God hath made both alike profitably; and hath
revealed some things, but hidden others, providing for thy safety.

<span id="xix.xiv-p33"></span>8. One mode, then, of knowing God, is that
by the creation, which I have spoken of, and which might occupy many
days. For in order that we might go over the formation of man only with
exactness, (and I speak of exactness such as is possible to us, not of
real exactness; since many as are the reasons we have already given for
the works of creation, many more of these there are, ineffable, which
God who made them knoweth, for of course we do not know them all); in
order then, I say, that we might take an exact survey of the whole
modelling of man; and that we might discover the skill there is in every
member; and examine the distribution and situation of the sinews, the
veins, and the arteries, and the moulding of every other part; not even
a whole year would suffice for such a disquisition.

<span id="xix.xiv-p34"></span>9. For this reason, here dismissing this
subject; and having given to the laborious and studious an opportunity,
by what has been said, of going over likewise the other parts of
Creation; we shall now direct our discourse to another point which is
itself also demonstrative of God’s providence. What then is this second
point? It is, that when God formed man, he implanted within him from the
beginning a natural law. And what then was this natural law? He gave
utterance to conscience within us; and made the knowledge of good
things, and of those which are the contrary, to be self-taught. For we
have no need to learn that fornication is an evil thing, and that
chastity is a good thing, but we know this from the first. And that you
may learn that we know this from the first, the Lawgiver, <span
id="fr_1519"></span>[1520](#fn_1519.md) when He afterwards gave laws, and
said, “Thou shalt not kill,” <span id="fr_1520"></span>[1521](#fn_1520.md)
did not add, “since murder is an evil thing,” but simply said, “Thou
shall not kill;” for He merely prohibited the sin, without teaching. How
was it then when He said, “Thou shalt not kill,” that He did not add,
“because murder is a wicked thing.” The reason was, that conscience had
taught this beforehand; and He speaks thus, as to those who know and
understand the point. Wherefore when He speaks to us of another
commandment, not known to us by the dictate of consciences He not only
prohibits, but adds the reason. When, for instance, He gave commandment
<span id="page_422">p. 422</span> <span
id="xix.xiv-Page_422"></span>respecting the Sabbath; “On the seventh day
thou shalt do no work;” He subjoined also the reason for this cessation.
What was this? “Because on the seventh day God rested from all His works
which He had begun to make.” <span id="fr_1521"></span>[1522](#fn_1521.md)
And again; “Because thou wert a servant in the land of Egypt.” <span
id="fr_1522"></span>[1523](#fn_1522.md) For what purpose then I ask did He
add a reason respecting the Sabbath, but did no such thing in regard to
murder? Because this commandment was not one of the leading ones. It was
not one of those which were accurately defined of our conscience, but a
kind of partial and temporary one; and for this reason it was abolished
afterwards. <span id="fr_1523"></span>[1524](#fn_1523.md) But those which
are necessary and uphold our life, are the following; “Thou shalt not
kill; Thou shalt not commit adultery; Thou shalt not steal.” On this
account then He adds no reason in this case, nor enters into any
instruction on the matter, but is content with the bare prohibition.

<span id="xix.xiv-p40"></span>10. And not only from thence, but from
another consideration also, I will endeavour to shew you how man was
self-taught with respect to the knowledge of virtue. Adam sinned the
first sin; and after the sin straightway hid himself; but if he had not
known he had been doing something wrong, why did he hide himself? For
then there were neither letters, nor law, nor Moses. Whence then doth he
recognise the sin, and hide himself? Yet not only does he so hide
himself, but when called to account, he endeavours to lay the blame on
another, saying, “The woman, whom Thou gavest me, she gave me of the
tree, and I did eat.” And that woman again transfers the accusation to
another, viz. the serpent. Observe also the wisdom of God; for when Adam
said, “I heard Thy voice, and I was afraid, for I was naked, and I hid
myself,” <span id="fr_1524"></span>[1525](#fn_1524.md) God does not at once
convict him of what he had done, nor say, “Why hast thou eaten of the
tree?” But how? “Who told thee,” He asks, “that thou wast naked, unless
thou hast eaten of that Tree of which alone I commanded thee not to
eat?” He did not keep silence, nor did He openly convict him. He did not
keep silence, that He might call him forth to the confession of his
crime. He did not convict him openly, lest the whole might come from
Himself, and the man should so be deprived of that pardon which is
granted us from confession. <span id="fr_1525"></span>[1526](#fn_1525.md)
Therefore he did not declare openly the cause from whence this knowledge
sprung, but he carried on the discourse in the form of interrogation,
leaving the man himself to come to the confession.

<span id="xix.xiv-p43"></span>11. Again, in the case of Cain and Abel,
the same proceeding is observable. For, in the first place, they set
apart the fruits of their own labours to God. For we would shew not from
his sin only, but also from his virtue, that man was capable of knowing
both these things. Wherefore that man knew sin to be an evil thing, Adam
manifested; and that he knew that virtue was a good thing, Abel again
made evident. For without having learnt it from any one, without having
heard any law promulgated respecting the first fruits, but having been
taught from within, and from his conscience, he presented that
sacrifice. On this account I do not carry the argument down to a later
period; but I bring it to bear upon the time of these earlier men, when
there were as yet no letters, as yet no <span
id="fr_1526"></span>[1527](#fn_1526.md) law, nor as yet prophets and
judges; but Adam only existed with his children; in order that thou
mayest learn, that the knowledge of good and evil had been previously
implanted in their natures. For from whence did Abel learn that to offer
sacrifice was a good thing; <span id="fr_1527"></span>[1528](#fn_1527.md)
that it was good to honour God, and in all things to give thanks? “Why
then?” replies some one, “did not Cain bring his offering?” This man
also did offer sacrifice, but not in like manner. And from <span
id="page_423">p. 423</span> <span id="xix.xiv-Page_423"></span>thence
again the knowledge of conscience is apparent. For when, envying him who
had been honoured, he deliberated upon murder, he conceals his crafty
determination. And what says he; “Come, let us go forth into the
field.” <span id="fr_1528"></span>[1529](#fn_1528.md) The outward guise was
one thing, the pretence of love; the thought another, the purpose of
fratricide. But if he had not known the design to be a wicked one, why
did he conceal it? And again, after the murder had been perpetrated,
being asked of God, “Where is Abel thy brother?” he answers, “I know
not; Am I my brother’s keeper?” Wherefore does he deny the crime? Is it
not evidently because he exceedingly condemns himself. For as his father
had hid himself, so also this man denies his guilt, and after his
conviction, again says, “My crime is too great to obtain pardon.” <span
id="fr_1529"></span>[1530](#fn_1529.md)

<span id="xix.xiv-p48"></span>12. But it may be objected, that the
Gentile allows nothing of this sort. Come then, let us discuss this
point, and as we have done with respect to the creation, having carried
on the warfare against these objectors not only by the help of the
Scriptures, but of reason, so also let us now do with respect to
conscience. For Paul too, when he was engaged in controversy with such
persons, entered upon this head. What then is it that they urge? They
say, that there is no self-evident law seated in our consciences; and
that God hath not implanted this in our nature. But if so, whence is it,
I ask, that legislators have written those laws which are among them
concerning marriages, concerning murders, concerning wills, concerning
trusts, concerning abstinence from encroachments on one another, and a
thousand other things. For the men now living may perchance have learned
them from their elders; <span id="fr_1530"></span>[1531](#fn_1530.md) and
they from those who were before them, and these again from those beyond?
But from whom did those learn who were the originators and first
enactors of laws among them? Is it not evident that it was from
conscience? For they cannot say, that they held communication with
Moses; or that they heard the prophets. How could it be so when they
were Gentiles? But it is evident that from the very law which God placed
in man when He formed him from the beginning, laws were laid down, and
arts discovered, and all other things. For the arts too were thus
established, their originators having come to the knowledge of them in a
self-taught manner.

<span id="xix.xiv-p50"></span>13. So also came there to be courts of
justice, and so were penalties defined, as Paul accordingly observes.
For since many of the Gentiles were ready to controvert this, and to
say, “How will God judge mankind who lived before Moses? He did not send
a lawgiver; He did not introduce a law; He commissioned no prophet, nor
apostle, nor evangelist; how then can He call these to account?” Since
Paul therefore wished to prove that they possessed a self taught law;
and that they knew clearly what they ought to do; hear how he speaks;
“For when the Gentiles who have not the law, do by nature the things
contained in the law, these having not the law, are a law unto
themselves; which shew the work of the law written in their
hearts.” <span id="fr_1531"></span>[1532](#fn_1531.md) But how without
letters? “Their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the
meanwhile accusing, or else excusing one another. In the day when God
shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my
gospel.” <span id="fr_1532"></span>[1533](#fn_1532.md) And again; “As many
as have sinned without law, shall perish without law; and as many as
have sinned in the law, shall be judged by the law.” <span
id="fr_1533"></span>[1534](#fn_1533.md) What means, “They shall perish
without law?” The law not accusing them, but their thoughts, and their
conscience; for if they had not a law of conscience, it were not
necessary that they should perish through having done amiss. For how
should it be so if they sinned without a law? but when he says, “without
a law,” he does not assert that they had no law, but that they had no
written law, though they had the law of nature. And again; “But glory,
honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and
also to the Gentile.” <span id="fr_1534"></span>[1535](#fn_1534.md)

<span id="xix.xiv-p55"></span>14. But these things he spake in reference
to the early times, before the coming of Christ; and the Gentile he
names here is not an idolater, but one who worshipped God only;
unfettered by the necessity of Judaical observances, (I mean Sabbaths,
and circumcision, and divers purifications,) yet exhibiting all manner
of wisdom and piety. <span id="fr_1535"></span>[1536](#fn_1535.md) And
<span id="page_424">p. 424</span> <span
id="xix.xiv-Page_424"></span>again, discoursing of such a worshipper, he
observes, “Wrath and indignation, tribulation and anguish, upon every
soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the
Gentile.” <span id="fr_1536"></span>[1537](#fn_1536.md) Again he here calls
by the name of Greek one who was free from the observance of Judaic
customs. If, then, he had not heard the law, nor conversed with the
Jews, how could there be wrath, indignation and tribulation against him
for working evil? The reason is, that he possessed a conscience inwardly
admonishing him, and teaching him, and instructing him in all things.
Whence is this manifest? From the way in which he <span
id="fr_1537"></span>[1538](#fn_1537.md) punished others when they did
amiss; from the way in which he laid down laws; from the way in which he
set up the tribunals of justice. With the view of making this more
plain, Paul spoke of those who were living in wickedness. “Who, knowing
the ordinance of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of
death, not only do the same, but also consent with them that practise
them.” <span id="fr_1538"></span>[1539](#fn_1538.md) “But from whence,”
says some one, “did they know, that it is the will of God, that those
who live in iniquity should be punished with death?” From whence? Why,
from the way in which they judged others who sinned. For if thou deemest
not murder to be a wicked thing, when thou hast gotten a murderer at thy
bar, thou shouldest not punish him. So if thou deemest it not an evil
thing to commit adultery, when the adulterer has fallen into thy hands,
release him from punishment! But if thou recordest laws, and prescribest
punishments, and art a severe judge of the sins of others; what defence
canst thou make, in matters wherein thou thyself doest amiss, by saying
that thou art ignorant what things ought to be done? For suppose that
thou and another person have alike been guilty of adultery. On what
account dost thou punish him, and deem thyself worthy of forgiveness?
Since if thou didst not know adultery to be wickedness, it were not
right to punish it in another. But if thou punishest, and thinkest to
escape the punishment thyself, how is it agreeable to reason that the
same offences should not pay the same penalty?

<span id="xix.xiv-p60"></span>15. This indeed is the very thing which
Paul rebukes, when he says, “And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest
them which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape
the judgment of God?” <span id="fr_1539"></span>[1540](#fn_1539.md) It is
not, it cannot be possible; for from the very sentence, he means, which
thou pronouncest upon another, from this sentence God will then judge
thee. For surely thou art not just, and God unjust! But if thou
overlookest not another suffering wrong, how shall God overlook? And if
thou correctest the sins of others, how will not God correct thee? And
though He may not bring the punishment upon thee instantly, be not
confident on that account, but fear the more. So also Paul bade thee,
saying, “Despisest thou the riches of His goodness, and forbearance, and
longsuffering, not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to
repentance?” <span id="fr_1540"></span>[1541](#fn_1540.md) For therefore,
saith he, doth he bear with thee, not that thou mayest become worse, but
that thou mayest repent. But if thou wilt not, this longsuffering
becomes a cause of thy greater punishment; continuing, as thou dost,
impenitent. This, however, is the very thing he means, when he says,
“But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up to thyself
wrath against the day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgment
of God. Who will render to every man according to his deeds.” <span
id="fr_1541"></span>[1542](#fn_1541.md) Since, therefore, He rendereth to
every man according to his works; for this reason He both implanted
within us a natural law, and afterwards gave us a written one, in order
that He might demand an account of sins, and that He might crown those
who act rightly. Let us then order our conduct with the utmost care, and
as those who have soon to encounter a fearful tribunal; knowing that we
shall enjoy no pardon, if after a natural as well as written law, and so
much teaching and continual admonition, we neglect our own salvation.

<span id="xix.xiv-p64"></span>16. I desire then to address you again on
the subject of oaths; but I feel ashamed. For to me, indeed, it is not
wearisome both by day and by night to repeat the same things to you. But
I am afraid, lest, having followed you up so many days, I should seem to
condemn you of great listlessness, that you should require continual
admonition respecting so easy a matter. And I am not only ashamed, but
also in fear for you! for frequent instruction to those who give heed,
is salutary and profitable; but to those who are listless, it is
injurious, and exceedingly perilous; for the oftener any one hears, the
greater punishment does he draw upon himself, if he does not practise
what is told him. With this accordingly God reproached the Jews,
speaking thus: “I have sent my prophets, rising up early, and sending
them; and even then ye did not hearken.” <span
id="fr_1542"></span>[1543](#fn_1542.md) We therefore do this of our great
care for you. But we fear, lest, on that tremendous Day, this ad<span
id="page_425">p. 425</span> <span id="xix.xiv-Page_425"></span>monition
and counsel should rise up against you all. For when the point to be
attained is easy, and he whose office it is continually to admonish,
desists not from his task, what defence shall we have to offer? or what
argument will save us from punishment? Tell me, if a sum of money chance
to be due to you, do you not always, when you meet the debtor, remind
him of the loan? Do thou too <span id="fr_1543"></span>[1544](#fn_1543.md)
act thus; and let every one suppose that his neighbour owes him money,
viz., the fulfilling of this precept; and upon meeting him, let him put
him in mind of the payment, knowing that no small danger lies at our
door, whilst we are unmindful of our brethren. For this cause I too
cease not to make mention of these things. For I fear, lest by any means
I should hear it said on that day, “O wicked and slothful servant, thou
oughtest to have put my money to the exchangers.” <span
id="fr_1544"></span>[1545](#fn_1544.md) Behold, however, I have laid it
down, <span id="fr_1545"></span>[1546](#fn_1545.md) not once, or twice, but
oftentimes. It is left then for you to discharge the usury of it. Now
the usury of hearing is the manifestation of it by deeds, for the
deposit is the Lord’s. Therefore let us not negligently receive that
with which we are entrusted; but let us keep it with diligence, that we
may restore it with much interest on That Day. For unless thou bring
others to the performance of the same good works, thou shalt hear that
voice, which he who buried the talent heard. But God forbid it should be
this! but may you hear that different voice which Christ uttered, saying
to him who had made profit, “Well done, good and faithful servant; thou
hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many
things.” <span id="fr_1546"></span>[1547](#fn_1546.md)

<span id="xix.xiv-p70"></span>17. And this voice we shall hear, if we
shew the same earnestness as he did. And we shall shew this earnestness,
if we do this which I say. When you depart, whilst what you have heard
is yet warm within you, exhort one another! And just as ye each salute
at parting, so let every one go from hence with an admonition, and say
to his neighbour, “Observe and remember that thou keep the commandment;”
and thus shall we assuredly get the mastery. For when friends also
dismiss one with such counsel; and on one’s return home, one’s wife
again admonishes one to the same effect; and our word keeps its hold on
you when alone; we shall soon shake off this evil habit. I know, indeed,
that ye marvel why I am so earnest respecting this precept. But
discharge the duty enjoined, and then I will tell you. Meanwhile, this I
say; that this precept is a divine law; and it is not safe to transgress
it. But if I shall see it rightly performed, I will speak of another
reason, <span id="fr_1547"></span>[1548](#fn_1547.md) which is not less
than this, that ye may learn that it is with justice I make so much ado
about this law. But it is now time to conclude this address in a prayer.
Wherefore, let us all say in common, “O God, Who willest not the death
of a sinner, but that he should be converted and live; grant that we,
having discharged this and every other precept, may be found worthy so
to stand at the tribunal of Thy Christ, that having enjoyed great
boldness, we may attain the kingdom to Thy glory. For to Thee belongeth
glory, together with Thine only begotten Son, and the Holy Ghost, now
and ever, and world without end.” Amen.

to employment in things spiritual;” thus making the Sabbath a *type* of

<span id="xix.xiv-p45"></span> See Davison’s “Inquiry into the Origin
and Intent of Primitive Sacrifice,” reprinted in his Remains, where this
view is maintained as at least probable, and freed from some objections.
Archbishop Magee, in his work on the Atonement, vol. i. no. 41, vol. ii.
no. 54, 58, &c., maintains the original, divine institution. It is
difficult now to judge what may have been likely to seem reasonable and
natural to our first parents, who had a stronger apprehension of natural
things, as well as a more sensible communion with God, than we. It may
be observed, that such a view does not interfere with the strictly
typical character of the sacrifice, because man is made in the image of
God, and many things which he does of mere nature, as well as moral
actions not specially enjoined, are typical, and represented as typical
in Holy Scripture. And again, sacrifice, if it originated in God’s gift
of reason, was certainly sanctioned, and endowed with an atoning power,
by His special laws. The prevailing neglect of our Eucharistic oblation
as such, and separating in thought our partaking of the sacrifice of our
Lord from the sacrament of the altar, tend to obscure men’s views on
this subject. It is, however, difficult to conceive how the sacrifice of
*animals* should have occurred to man, without some divine indication
beyond the permission to use them for food. St. Chrys. on [Gen.
iv.](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#000.md)<span id="xix.xiv-p45.1"></span>
Hom. XVIII. (5), speaks of nothing more than an offering “out of our
possessions” as taught by natural conscience; and of Abel’s offering
being of the first-born, and of the best, as a proof of his devotion. On
this view the *type* would arise from the divine permission of animal
food.

<span id="xix.xiv-p56"></span> The term ῞Ελλην, “Gentile,” or literally
“Greek,” usually at that time meant idolater. Thus we find many works of
the Fathers “against the Greeks.” But on the passage referred to, Hom.
V. on Rom., he expressly includes Melchizedek and Job under the name as
there used. These expressions, therefore, indicate what a man might be,
though a Gentile, not what Gentiles usually were. Observe also that his
description applies only to those spoken of in verse 10. But the being
out of the Jewish Covenant applies also to the Gentiles in verses 8 and
9.
