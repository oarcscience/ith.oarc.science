<span id="xix.ii-p1"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xix.ii-p1.1"></span>PREFACE TO THE BENEDICTINE EDITION.</span>

<span id="xix.ii-p2"></span>1. <span class="c12"><span
id="xix.ii-p2.1"></span>Among</span> the events which occurred in the
time of John Chrysostom, <span id="fr_967"></span>[968](#fn_967.md) there
is none more memorable than that sedition of the inhabitants of Antioch,
in which the Statues of the Emperor Theodosius and Flacilla his wife
were thrown down and dragged about the city, at which Theodosius was so
exasperated, as even to think of destroying the city entirely. This
afforded ample matter for our Chrysostom to exercise his powers of
preaching. For as the people of Antioch were fluctuating between hope
and fear (sudden accidents offering of course daily some fresh cause for
hope or alarm) Chrysostom, compelled as he was to adapt his style to
circumstances as they arose, almost always without preparation,
delivered on the spur of the occasion these Homilies, which are
certainly well deserving of admiration. At one time his object here is
to console a people struggling with present distress; at another, to
strengthen minds that were sinking under the extremity of danger; and
above all, by repeated admonition, to persuade the people of Antioch, on
occasion of the threatened calamities, to correct the vices and to wipe
away the crimes that had thus provoked God’s wrath; which endeavour on
the part of Chrysostom certainly ended in results agreeable to his
desire, as he sometimes acknowledges.

<span id="xix.ii-p4"></span>2. But the cause of this great sedition was,
according to the testimony of Zosimus, excess of taxation, which was
daily inventing new imposts; an exaction required either for the
celebration of the fifth year upon which Arcadius had entered, from the
time he was proclaimed under the title of Augustus, and the tenth year
of the Emperor Theodosius, commencing in the year 388, or for the
expenses of the war against the tyrant Maximus, <span
id="fr_968"></span>[969](#fn_968.md) or on account of both these events, as
well as for other necessities of the state. The people of Antioch, that
is to say, the superior class of the citizens, dismayed at the burden of
this impost, first approached the prefect, and with tears lamented the
excess of the tax that had been announced, and implored the Divine
assistance. And next, a multitude of vagabonds and foreigners of the
lowest class of the people, <span id="fr_969"></span>[970](#fn_969.md) in a
state of excited feeling, broke out into deeds of violence. At first
they turned every thing upside down in the public baths; hence they
proceeded to the prefect’s palace, and attacked the doors and windows,
and were scarcely repelled, when they turned their rage in another
direction, and attacked the painted tablets of the Emperors with stones,
covered them with filth, and reduced them to a ruinous condition, while
they loaded the Augusti themselves with curses and reproaches. At length
they threw down the Statues of the Emperor Theodosius and Flacilla his
deceased wife, <span id="fr_970"></span>[971](#fn_970.md) and dragged them
through the streets of the city; and had already commenced further
outrages, when they were put down by a band of archers, dispatched from
the prefect. The sedition being thus extinguished, fear took the place
of madness, and the expectation of impending punishment caused the
burdensome tax that had been imposed to <span id="page_318">p.
318</span> <span id="xix.ii-Page_318"></span>be entirely forgotten. What
followed afterwards will be narrated below in the review of the
Homilies. Something must now be said as to the year of the sedition, in
which these Homilies were delivered.

<span id="xix.ii-p8"></span>3. Dismissing the narrative of Sozomen and
Theodoret, according to whose account, this sedition, and the delivery
of these discourses, must have been after the war against Maximus,
learned men, and Tillemont especially (at length in note 27 appended to
his Life of the Emperor Theodosius) have proved from far more certain
notes of time, that these events took place before the war against
Maximus. In opposition to that former opinion, he produces a most
convincing argument from Chrysostom’s own words, who in the sixteenth
Homily (No. 2.), testifies that this was the second year since he had
begun to preach; but he began when he was first ordained presbyter at
the end of the year 385, or at the beginning of 386. Wherefore these
discourses ought to be attributed either to the year 388, or rather 387.
For the former opinion Baronius contends, and after him, Petavius and
Henry Valesius, who assign them to the year 388, for this reason, that
the tenth year of the reign of Theodosius then commenced, for the
celebration of which the tax before mentioned was imposed. But what is
adduced from Libanius for the defence of this opinion is full of
perplexity, <span id="fr_971"></span>[972](#fn_971.md) and is capable of
being twisted to support either opinion. A still more certain indication
than any of these is gathered from the circumstance, that the Emperor
Theodosius was certainly at Constantinople during the winter and Lent of
the year 387, in which year also the sedition must necessarily have
occurred; for at the time of the sedition he was most certainly staying
at Constantinople, <span id="fr_972"></span>[973](#fn_972.md) but on the
other hand at the same season in the year immediately following, he was
living at Thessalonica. But what is alleged to the contrary from the
celebration of the tenth year of Theodosius, which commenced in the year
388, amounts, as I said, to nothing; since it is evident from the Fasti
of Idatius and of Marcellinus, that he anticipated by one year the
celebration of the tenth year of his reign, in order that he might
celebrate his tenth together with his son Arcadius, who entered upon the
fifth year of his reign in 387; just in the same manner as Maximianus
Herculius did, when he celebrated the twentieth, though it was only the
eighteenth, year of his reign, along with Diocletion, whose twentieth
year of empire it was. <span id="fr_973"></span>[974](#fn_973.md)

<span id="xix.ii-p12"></span>4. But another and not a less difficulty
arises, which has been already treated of in the Preface to the work,
“Against the Jews;” viz. that in a certain discourse against the Jews,
held in the month of September of the year 386, Chrysostom in reproving
many of the Christians at Antioch who fasted and kept Easter <span
id="fr_974"></span>[975](#fn_974.md) with the Jews, or at the same time
observed by the Jews, “Behold,” saith he, “the first day of unleavened
bread in this year falls on Sunday, and it is necessary that we should
fast throughout the whole week, and after the Passion is past, and the
Cross and the Resurrection arrived, <span
id="fr_975"></span>[976](#fn_975.md) we should continue fasting; and very
often the same thing occurs, that after the Passion has passed away, and
the Cross and the Resurrection arrived, we are still keeping the fast,
the week being not yet finished.” From these words it is further
evident, that those Christians, who acted as Jews in keeping <span
id="page_319">p. 319</span> <span id="xix.ii-Page_319"></span>the fast
and celebrating the Passover, must sometimes have fasted when other
Christians were celebrating the Paschal feast, and at other times not
so; for example, they fasted on the day of the Resurrection when the
Jews celebrated the feast of the Passover later than the rest of the
Christians did, but they did not fast when the Jews celebrated the same
feast earlier than the Christians. But in the discourse of Chrysostom
above mentioned, and held about the month of September of the year 386,
he is doubtless treating of Lent and Easter of the year 387. But in that
year, according to the Paschal tables, the feast fell on the 25th of
April, that is to say, as late as it can possibly occur. How then could
these judaizing Christians be fasting this year during the Paschal
feast, and celebrate that feast too late, when this could not occur
later than on the 25th of April, on which day the other nonjudaizing
Christians celebrated it this year, at least if the Paschal tables are
to be relied upon? This is certainly a very great difficulty; but one
which, as Tillemont himself confesses, is not sufficient to overturn the
marks of the period by which we assign the Homily, “Against the Jews,”
to the month of September, in the year 386. For as we have said in the
Preface to the Homilies against the Jews, it has not yet been made out
to us so certainly, whether the people of Antioch always followed by an
invariable rule the Alexandrian reckoning as to the Feast of the Lord’s
Passover, and if they had always followed it, can we affirm that they
never fell into error in their reckoning? Certainly the persons best
skilled in the Paschal reckonings, whom I have consulted, have admitted
that an error of this sort sometimes does happen in such reckonings, and
did happen not many years since; and that it is not always safe to
prefer the Paschal indications to any other notes of time.

<span id="xix.ii-p15"></span>5. Tillemont, however, who notices this
kind of difficulty, and discusses it in his notes to the Life of
Chrysostom, where he treats of the Homilies against the Jews, has not
mentioned it in the notes to the Life of the Emperor Theodosius, where
he arranges these Homilies of Chrysostom to the people of Antioch as if
the Feast of Easter had fallen on the 25th of April, as the Paschal
tables have it. The first Homily therefore he places a little before the
sedition; but the sedition on the 26th of February, ten days before
Lent, which at Antioch began on the Monday of our Quinquagesima, falling
that year on the 8th of March. The second Homily either on the Thursday,
or the Saturday before Lent; viz. on the 6th of March, the eighth day
after the sedition. The third on the following Sunday, the 7th of March,
or thereabout. The fourth, on the Monday following, March 8. The fifth,
on Tuesday, March 9. The sixth, about the next Wednesday, on March 10.
The seventh, on Thursday, March 11. The eighth, on Friday, March 12. The
ninth on the Monday of the second week in Lent, March 15. The tenth,
after the lapse of a few days. The eleventh, (considering it
transposed,) on the Monday of the fourth week in Lent, March 29. The
twelfth, on the following Tuesday, March 30. The thirteenth, on the
following Wednesday, March 31. The fourteenth, a little after that one
which is numbered the eighteenth, which was delivered on the fifth
Sunday in Lent, April 5. The fifteenth, on the Saturday of the second
week in Lent, or March 20. The sixteenth, on the third Saturday in Lent,
March 21. The seventeenth, about the end of the fourth week in Lent. The
eighteenth, Sunday, April 5, or thereabout. The nineteenth, after the
fourteenth, about April 11. The twentieth, on Easter Day, April 25. The
twenty-first, about the same time as the twenty-second following it,
which was delivered on the Friday after Passion Sunday, April 16. <span
id="fr_976"></span>[977](#fn_976.md) Thus does Tillemont endeavour to
restore with the utmost accuracy the deranged order of these Homilies.
Whilst however we agree with him in many things, we are compelled to
differ from him in others. The order of the Homilies, as he lays it
down, we may here further represent in one tabular view.

<span id="xix.ii-p17"></span> <span id="page_320">p. 320</span> <span

<span id="xix.ii-p37"></span>21st........... Twenty-first

<span id="xix.ii-p38"></span>22d........... Twentieth

<span id="xix.ii-p39"></span>But before we discourse singly of the
Homilies, and make a few observations as to the order as well as the
argument of each, it may be worth while to remark, that from the title
of the Homily which formerly was numbered the twenty-second, but not the
twentieth, which title it has in the notes of Fronton, and in our <span
class="c12"><span id="xix.ii-p39.1"></span>mss.</span>; it must have
been spoken ten days before Easter; and that from these words likewise,
just before the end of the Homily, “Forty days have already passed
away,” Tillemont justly infers, that Lent among the people of Antioch
began on the Monday after Quinquagesima; and that among them the whole
Lent extended through seven weeks; and he rightly assigns this Homily to
a Friday during Lent; <span id="fr_977"></span>[978](#fn_977.md) so that
that day was both the fortieth from the beginning of the fast, and the
tenth before Easter. Hence we hold it as a thing established, that Lent,
which in divers Churches was defined by various limits, was observed at
Antioch during seven <span id="fr_978"></span>[979](#fn_978.md) weeks.

<span id="xix.ii-p42"></span>Moreover, since for the causes before
related, we may account the diurnal Paschal tables, which place the
Easter of the year 387 upon the 25th of April, as of doubtful
authority, <span id="fr_979"></span>[980](#fn_979.md) at least those for
the use of the Church at Antioch; we have not discovered with certainty
on what day the people of Antioch kept Easter in this year 387, we shall
abstain from mentioning the day of the month in the review of the
Homilies, and we shall account it sufficient to have indicated, when
that may be safely done, on what day of the week the Homilies were
spoken.

<span id="xix.ii-p44"></span>The first Homily, then, was delivered a few
days before the sedition at Antioch, as is discoverable from these words
in No. (3) of the second Homily; “I lately protracted a long discourse
to your charity and I have received <span
id="fr_980"></span>[981](#fn_980.md) reward for my labours. But what was
the reward? To punish the blasphemers in the city, and to chastise those
who treat God with contempt, and to restrain the violent.” Without doubt
these words have reference to the first Homily, one of great length, on
the subject of the sorrows of the Saints, and the providence of God
towards His Elect, who are tormented in this life, where <span
id="page_321">p. 321</span> <span id="xix.ii-Page_321"></span>at last he
thus expresses himself in a manner certainly worthy of observation. “But
since our discourse has now turned to the subject of blasphemy, I desire
to ask one favour of you all in return for this address and speaking
with you, which is, that you will correct on my behalf those who
blaspheme in this city. And should you hear any one in the public
thoroughfare, or in the midst of the forum, blaspheming God; go up to
him, rebuke him; and should it be necessary to inflict blows, spare not
to do so. Smite him on the face; strike his mouth; sanctify thy hand
with the blow.” Which truly would be a mode of correction not suited to
modern usage.

<span id="xix.ii-p46"></span>The second Homily, Tillemont refers either
to the Thursday or to the Saturday before Lent; but it may more safely
be pronounced to have been spoken “about” that time, seven days having
been completed as Chrysostom himself says, since the sedition, during
which he declares that he had been silent, because the people of
Antioch, being in consternation from the mighty calamity and from the
immensity of the danger, were in no fit state for the hearing of
Sermons; moreover, that this evil was one sent from God, on account of
their having neglected the correction of their blaspheming brethren; and
after he has drawn a beautiful picture of their state, he concludes the
discourse, after having preached at length on riches, the use of riches,
alms-giving, and poverty.

<span id="xix.ii-p47"></span>The third Homily follows close on the
second. But we suppose with Tillemont, that it was delivered on
Quinquagesima Sunday (to speak according to modern custom). Chrysostom
treats here of the departure of Flavian the Bishop of Antioch to
Constantinople for the purpose of appeasing the Emperor, and consoles
the people with the hope of his succeeding. He then proves at length
that there is no utility in fasting, unless there be an abstinence from
vices. But after making a few remarks on avoiding slander, he deplores
the present calamity, and relates some harsh severities. “Some,” saith
he, “have perished by the sword, some by fire; some given to wild
beasts; and not men only but children. And neither this immaturity of
age, nor the tumult of the people, nor the circumstance that they were
infuriated by demons when they perpetrated such deeds, nor that the
exaction was thought to be intolerable, nor poverty, nor having offended
in company with all, nor promising that they would never hereafter dare
to repeat such deeds, nor any thing else could at all rescue them; but
they were led away to the pit without reprieve, armed soldiers
conducting and guarding them on either side, lest any one should carry
off the criminals; whilst mothers also followed afar off, seeing their
children beheaded, but not daring to bewail their calamity; for terror
conquered grief, and fear overcame nature.”

<span id="xix.ii-p48"></span>All these evils were inflicted on the
people of Antioch by the Prefects or Magistrates before Theodosius had
heard any thing of the sedition, as Chrysostom says in the same place.
But he concludes the address by admonishing that they should abstain
from slander, from enmities, and from oaths.

<span id="xix.ii-p49"></span>The fourth Homily, delivered as it seems on
the Monday, which was the beginning of Lent, describes the advantages
gained from the calamity. He speaks of the people of Antioch as changed
and brought back from their former habits. But at the close he again
repeats the same admonition, which he reminds them that he had given in
the foregoing Homily, that is to say, concerning slanders, enmities, and
oaths. But in No. (6.), he says, that he should speak throughout this
week concerning oaths.

<span id="xix.ii-p50"></span>The fifth Homily was pronounced on the day
following, that is, on the Tuesday, as Chrysostom says at the beginning
of it. In this Chrysostom consoles the people of Antioch as usual, under
their sadness, and exhorts them to a contempt for death. In the end also
he treats No. (7.) of the avoidance of oaths, and indicates somewhat of
the order of the foregoing and following Homilies in these words. “Let
us therefore persuade it (our soul) to make this first change for the
better by the avoidance of oaths; for although I spake to <span
id="page_322">p. 322</span> <span id="xix.ii-Page_322"></span>you
yesterday and the day before <span id="fr_981"></span>[982](#fn_981.md) on
this same subject, yet neither to-day, nor to-morrow, nor the day after,
will I desist from giving my counsel on this subject.”

<span id="xix.ii-p52"></span>In the sixth Homily, delivered on the
Wednesday of the first week, he imparts consolation to the afflicted,
and urges them to hope for a prosperous turn of affairs. He speaks of
the delays the messengers had met with, who were gone to announce to the
Emperor the sedition at Antioch, as proceeding from God; and from thence
deduces a favourable hope for his hearers, and bids them feel confidence
of obtaining pardon by the petition of Flavian the Bishop; and after he
had discoursed on the subject of not being afraid of death, he again
speaks as usual against oaths.

<span id="xix.ii-p53"></span>The seventh Homily was delivered, as is
evident from many indications, on the day following. “It is the fifth
day,” says Chrysostom, “we are engaged in speaking words of comfort to
your charity.” But this fifth day is reckoned by beginning from the
Sunday, so that he must be speaking of the fifth day of the week. He
here treats of the first words of Genesis, “In the beginning God made
heaven and earth;” and he observes, that God is not only good when He
chastises, but also when He confers favours; <span
id="fr_982"></span>[983](#fn_982.md) and concludes by exhorting to avoid
oaths.

<span id="xix.ii-p55"></span>The eighth Homily Tillemont supposes to
have been spoken on the day following the seventh Homily, that is, on
the Friday. But Chrysostom disclaims it, who testifies at the outset
that he discoursed on the passage, “In the beginning God made heaven and
earth, lately” (<span class="Greek"><span
id="xix.ii-p55.1"></span>πρῴην</span>) not yesterday (<span
class="Greek"><span id="xix.ii-p55.2"></span>χθšς</span>), which without
doubt belongs to the seventh Homily. Therefore the present Homily is to
be assigned to the Saturday; <span id="fr_983"></span>[984](#fn_983.md)
which these words just immediately after the beginning would also
incline us to think. “The week hath nearly arrived at its close with
us.” The argument of the Homily he draws from these words, “God was
walking in Paradise in the cool of the day.” On this he observes the
wicked are always timid and fearful, but the godly full of confidence.
Finally, he treats according to his custom of the avoiding of oaths, and
says, that it is now the sixth day since he had been admonishing as to
the observance of this law.

<span id="xix.ii-p57"></span>The ninth Homily Tillemont with probability
allots to the Monday of the second week in Lent. But as to this matter
no indication presents itself by which we may lay down any thing certain
or probable. This discourse was, however, delivered after a silence of
one or more days, as Chrysostom expressly states <span
id="fr_984"></span>[985](#fn_984.md) at the beginning; contrary to which is
the opinion of Tillemont, who, whilst he allots the eighth Homily to the
Friday of one week, and the ninth to the Monday of the week following,
says in the Life of Chrysostom, Art. (15.), that the intervening
Sabbaths and Lord’s days were doubtless distinguished by discourses of
Chrysostom, which discourses have been lost. Chrysostom, at the
commencement of this, praises the people of Antioch, that yielding to
his admonitions they were taking pains to expel the practice of oaths.
On these words also, “The heavens declare the glory of God,” he speaks
at length, and sets forth God’s providence in the order and harmony of
the natural world, and at length he concludes the address by admonishing
that oaths should be abstained from.

<span id="xix.ii-p59"></span>The tenth Homily was not delivered on the
day following the ninth, although it follows up the same argument, as is
shewn by the word, <span class="Greek"><span
id="xix.ii-p59.1"></span>πρῴην</span> “lately.” But Chrysostom here
congratulates his auditors that they had yielded to his admonitions. He
declares it is far better to hear the word of God than to fast. He then
proves that the world could not pos<span id="page_323">p. 323</span>
<span id="xix.ii-Page_323"></span>sibly subsist without a divine
Providence, and he ends, at length, by an exhortation to abstain from
oaths.

<span id="xix.ii-p60"></span>The eleventh Homily, Tillemont supposes to
have been delivered after that which here has the inscription of the
fifteenth, as well as after the sixteenth which follows it. The argument
he employs is this; In this Homily he says, the subject is concerning
certain dangers and distresses which the city of Antioch had already
passed through, which events seem to have taken place after the arrival
of Hellebichus and Cæsarius. But that arrival of Hellebichus and
Cæsarius is mentioned in the Title of the seventeenth Homily, <span
id="fr_985"></span>[986](#fn_985.md) long after the eleventh of which we
are now treating.

<span id="xix.ii-p62"></span>Supported by this argument, Tillemont
thinks that not only the fifteenth, but also the sixteenth ought to be
placed before the eleventh. But besides that all the Manuscripts,
without exception, preserve the very same order as the published
Editions, we have not a sufficiently accurate knowledge of all the
events, the dangers, terrors, and threats of the time, that for a reason
of this sort we should deem there ought to be any change in the order.
Chrysostom has spoken of many things, but was perhaps silent on many
more. Wherefore, until something more certain be brought to light, we
think the ancient order must be adhered to. In this Homily Chrysostom at
the beginning gives thanks, because the city breathed again after the
terror that had fallen on it, since multitudes had taken flight in
consequence of suspicions that had been thrown out among them. For some
days Chrysostom was silent (as he himself says) during this season of
calamity and terror. But Tillemont assigns this Homily to the Monday of
the fourth week in Lent, and indeed with the best reason, as we shall
shew when we come to the thirteenth Homily. In the present Homily he
treats principally of the wisdom of God in the constitution of man, and
at the end concerning the avoiding of oaths.

<span id="xix.ii-p63"></span>The twelfth, as well as the thirteenth, for
the same reason as above, Tillemont makes later than the fifteenth and
sixteenth. But I know not in what way he understands that passage in
this twelfth Homily, No. (2.) “On the three foregoing days, then, we
have investigated one method of acquiring the knowledge of God, and have
brought it to a conclusion, explaining how ‘the’ visible ‘heavens
declare the glory of God,’ and what is the meaning of that which is said
by Paul; ‘The invisible things of Him from the creation of the world are
clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made;’ and we have
shewed how from the creation of the world, and how by heaven, and earth,
and sea, the Creator is glorified. But to-day,” etc. Here Chrysostom
clearly refers to a series of these Homilies in the order in which they
were delivered before the twelfth, that is to say, the ninth, the tenth,
and the eleventh. In the ninth (No. 2.) he places as the argument of his
discourse the saying of Paul, “The invisible things of Him,” etc. as
well as that of the Psalms, “The heavens declare the glory of God.” In
the tenth (No. 2.) likewise he declares that he is pursuing this very
argument. In the eleventh (No. 2.) also he testifies that he is
insisting on the same argument. Is not Tillemont doing violence to the
words of Chrysostom, when he wishes the tenth and the eleventh to be
inserted between the fifteenth and sixteenth? This, however, he only
proposes, half doubtingly, in note (29) on the Emperor Theodosius, No.
10, 11 seqq. and he confesses, that the order which we have laid down is
clearly indicated by Chrysostom; but for what reason I know not, he
afterwards departs from the same order. But when Chrysostom says, “on
the three past days,” it is not to be understood of three successive
days, but of the three last days on which he had preached. In this
twelfth Homily, likewise, which was delivered on the Tuesday of the
fourth week, he dwells on the same subject of the wisdom of God in the
creation of the <span id="page_324">p. 324</span> <span
id="xix.ii-Page_324"></span>world. He afterwards treats of the natural
law, the knowledge of which God hath implanted in man, and on the
avoidance of oaths.

<span id="xix.ii-p64"></span>The thirteenth Homily was spoken the day
after the twelfth. At the commencement he returns thanks to God that the
face of affairs was changed, and the fear removed, which had been such
that “the greater part of the city,” as he says, “had taken refuge from
the fear and danger of that occasion in secret places, in deserts, and
hollows.” Hence he proceeds to speak of many who were dragged to the
tribunal; of the horrible inquisition that took place by means of the
scourge; of others who were hurried away to punishment; of a mother and
sister of a certain person, who, whilst he was undergoing his trial
within, were rolling in the dust at the vestibule. Chrysostom describes
pathetically these events which had been transacted a few days before,
that is to say, before he delivered the eleventh discourse. But the
words which Chrysostom uses in the beginning, <span class="Greek"><span
id="xix.ii-p64.1"></span>οἵαν τὴν παρελθοῢσαν εἴδομεν τετρ€δα καὶ οἵαν
τὴν παροῢσαν ὁρωμεν νῢν</span>, Bernard Brixianus thus renders, “Quale
præteritum vidimus quatriduum et quale nunc videmus præsens:” I know not
for what reason we have left this untouched. For although <span
class="Greek"><span id="xix.ii-p64.2"></span>τετρὰς</span> is sometimes
taken to signify the fourth day, yet in ecclesiastical language, even
from the time of Clemens Alexandrinus, <span class="Greek"><span
id="xix.ii-p64.3"></span>τετρὰς</span> is the fourth day of the week, so
that the Translation should be corrected, and should stand, “Qualem
feriam quartam præteritam vidimus,” etc. In which it is declared, that
the Homily was delivered on the fourth day of the week, and that indeed
the fourth week in Lent, or perhaps the third, according to another mode
of reckoning; since for many ages downwards the Greeks call that the
first Sunday and week of the fast <span
id="fr_986"></span>[987](#fn_986.md) which we call the first of Lent. But
this is only a question as to a name. The Homily was however delivered
on the fourth day of the week, and from the series of the Homilies, as
well as from the silence of Chrysostom, there seems plainly to be an
interval of some days between the tenth and eleventh Homilies. In this
Homily, moreover, after much premised on that calamity of Antioch, he
comes down to the former argument concerning man’s creation, and
concludes his discourse by an exhortation after his manner on avoiding
oaths.

<span id="xix.ii-p66"></span>The fourteenth Tillemont thinks ought to be
placed after the eighteenth; influenced by this reason, that Chrysostom
says at the beginning, “Not a little did the devil yesterday disturb our
city, but God hath also not a little comforted us again.” These words,
he observes, denote that the arrival of Hellebichus, and of news from
Constantinople, had already occurred. But these are mere conjectures
spoken at random. <span id="fr_987"></span>[988](#fn_987.md) How many
suspicions and terrors think you were cast abroad among the people of
Antioch, whilst they hung in doubt, and were ignorant to what result so
unhappy an affair might lead? But how can we possibly argue respecting
these terrors and reports, when we are doubtless ignorant of the greater
part of them, and have so obscure a perception of what we do know, that
we can scarcely gather from thence any indication of the time? This
Homily is almost wholly on the subject of avoiding oaths.

<span id="xix.ii-p68"></span>The fifteenth Homily, Tillemont would have
it, was delivered between the tenth and eleventh, both for the reasons
above mentioned, and because Chrysostom has these words at the
commencement, ­<span class="Greek"><span id="xix.ii-p68.1"></span>Εδει
καὶ τήμερον καὶ τῳ προτ™ρῳ σαββ€τῳ τὸν περὶ νηστείας κινησαι
λόγον.</span> “It had been right both to-day and on the former Sabbath,
to let the discourse turn on the subject of fasting.” Where he
understands the expression, <span class="Greek"><span
id="xix.ii-p68.2"></span>τῳ προτ™ρῳ</span>, as though it were <span
class="Greek"><span id="xix.ii-p68.3"></span> τῳ πρώτῳ</span>,—the first
Saturday in Lent, entertaining however some doubts on the point. But we,
as well as Bernard Brixianus, understand it of the earlier or preceding
one. <span id="fr_988"></span>[989](#fn_988.md) And we <span
id="page_325">p. 325</span> <span id="xix.ii-Page_325"></span>have
already proved in a former paragraph, that no other Homily can be placed
between the tenth and the eleventh. On the occasion of the dread with
which the people of Antioch <span id="fr_989"></span>[990](#fn_989.md) were
affected, he enlarges on the advantage of fear, and at the end he
preaches against the custom of swearing, and of requiring an oath from
others.

<span id="xix.ii-p71"></span>The sixteenth Homily was delivered when all
were deliberating upon making their escape from the city, in consequence
of a certain report, that a sack was to take place. Tillemont endeavours
also to change the position of this Homily, and to place it between the
tenth and eleventh, which, however, as we have said in our remarks upon
the twelfth, it cannot admit of. Tillemont further supports his argument
by these words: in No. 6, the holy Doctor says, “We have passed through
the second week of the fast.” He infers, therefore, that two weeks only
of the fast had passed away, and Tillemont on that ground determines,
that it ought to be moved out of its place. He supposes it was spoken on
the third Sunday in Lent, reckoning for the first Sunday that which
preceded the first day of the fast, which we call Quinquagesima Sunday.
But what if at Antioch at that time, that was called the first Sunday of
Lent, which according to modern custom occurs as the first within the
fast? <span id="fr_990"></span>[991](#fn_990.md) For the fast did begin the
Monday after Quinquagesima, and now it begins on the Wednesday, and the
people of Antioch might not reckon that week for the first week of Lent,
just as we do not reckon it as so, and in that way this Homily would
have been delivered one week later, that is to say, taking the Sunday
after the modern custom. But even then a great difficulty would remain,
for this Homily would precede the thirteenth and following ones.
Certainly all these points are full of perplexity, as Tillemont himself
confesses, who is compelled to leave the question, without entirely
coming to any conclusion upon it. Perhaps familiarity, and longer
handling, will add to our knowledge on so obscure a subject, which it is
possible we may be able to determine, in drawing up the life of
Chrysostom at the end of his works, <span
id="fr_991"></span>[992](#fn_991.md) more clearly and accurately. For which
reason we have purposely determined to leave the matter doubtful. That
one point only we contend for, that this Homily cannot be placed between
the tenth and eleventh, for the reasons above mentioned. Certain things
being premised as to the timidity of the people of Antioch, and the
avoiding of oaths, Chrysostom borrows the argument of the Homily from
those words of Paul, “Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our
brother;” and shews that Paul was more glorious from bonds, than from
the power of miracles.

<span id="xix.ii-p74"></span>The seventeenth was delivered after
Ellebichus, or Hellebichus, (styled Magister Militum), and Cæsarius,
(styled Magister), the persons sent by the Emperor for the purpose of
instituting an inquiry into the sedition, had arrived at Antioch. This
Hellebichus, Master of the Horse or <span
id="fr_992"></span>[993](#fn_992.md) Foot, is found mentioned elsewhere,
and was distinguished by a reputation for justice and clemency.
Cæsarius, also styled elsewhere Master of the Offices, enjoyed a similar
reputation for high character. But this Homily was pronounced when the
people of Antioch were almost free from fear. “We expected,” says
Chrysostom (No. 1.), “innumerable horrors, that the property of all was
to be plundered; the habitations consumed, together with their inmates;
the city snatched away from the midst of the world; and all its relics
obliterated, and its soil ploughed up: but, lo! all these things stood
only in expectance, and came not actually to pass.” Next he relates how
the monks descended from the mountains to Antioch, that they might
appease the judges, while at the same time all the Greek philosophers
deserted the city; and in what way also the priests strenuously exerted
<span id="page_326">p. 326</span> <span
id="xix.ii-Page_326"></span>themselves on behalf of the people. He
declares the penalties imposed by the Emperor to be light and easy, and
no matter of grief or complaint, though the orchestra and public bath
were closed, and the dignity of a metropolis taken away from the city of
Antioch. The true dignity of Antioch was, that the disciples of Christ
were first called Christians there; that the people of Antioch had
brought assistance to the saints at Jerusalem, when struggling with
famine; that not magnitude, but piety, is the ornament of cities.
Finally, however, he says that some were yet remaining in prison; and
that others were sent into exile. This Homily Tillemont assigns to the
fourth week of Lent, after Wednesday, but only from conjecture. <span
id="fr_993"></span>[994](#fn_993.md)

<span id="xix.ii-p77"></span>The eighteenth Homily was spoken after half
the fast was over, as Chrysostom himself says at the beginning. But
Tillemont thinks it may probably be assigned to the fifth Sunday of
Lent. He treats moreover of the true reason for fasting; of contempt for
riches; of godly sorrow, &c.

<span id="xix.ii-p78"></span>The nineteenth Homily was delivered as the
title has it, <span class="Greek"><span id="xix.ii-p78.1"></span>τῃ
κυριακῃ της ἐπισωζομ™νης</span>, or as Fronto Ducæus reads it, <span
class="Greek"><span id="xix.ii-p78.2"></span>της σωζομ™νμς.</span> Among
the Cappadocians, <span class="Greek"><span
id="xix.ii-p78.3"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="xix.ii-p78.4"></span>πισωζομ™νη</span> is Ascension Day, as Allatius
says in his book on the Sundays and Weeks of the Greeks, adding that the
Sunday thus called is the fifth after Easter, <span
id="fr_994"></span>[995](#fn_994.md) i.e. the one which precedes the
Ascension of our Lord. But Savile says that it is <span
id="fr_995"></span>[996](#fn_995.md) the first Sunday after Easter; from
whence he got his information I know not. Yet there seems no doubt that
it was some one of the last Sundays in Lent, or, as Tillemont supposes,
Passion-Sunday, to which I rather incline. Chrysostom, who had been
detained at home for some time by sickness, after he has prefaced his
subject with some remarks on the Festival of the Martyrs, which had been
just celebrated at Antioch, and on the arrival of the rustics, speaks
according to his custom against oaths, and illustrates their pernicious
effects by many examples.

<span id="xix.ii-p81"></span>Hitherto, in the number and order of the
Homilies, we have followed the editions of Savile and Fronto Ducæus. But
henceforth it is otherwise; for that which follows as the twentieth in
former editions, is without doubt the twenty-first and last on the
Statues. But the twenty-first is a Catechesis, which we have placed
second after another Catechesis, which was inscribed as the first, as we
remark in the Notice placed at the end of the Homilies on the Statues,
and in front of the Catechetical Lectures; since this Catechesis ought
to be placed entirely without the series of the Homilies on the Statues.
But the Homily, which is in former editions the twenty-second, is
without doubt the twentieth, which was delivered ten days before Easter.
Therefore we proceed in this order.

<span id="xix.ii-p82"></span>The twentieth Homily has these words in the
title, according to manuscripts mentioned by Fronto Ducæus, and likewise
in some of ours, and particularly that in the Royal Library, numbered
1971. <span class="Greek"><span id="xix.ii-p82.1"></span>Ελ™χθη δš πρὸ
δ™κα ἡμερων της ƒγίας καὶ ζωοποιου του Κυρίου ἡμων 'Ιησου Χριστου ἐκ
νεκρων ‡ναστ€σεως.</span> “It was spoken ten days before the holy and
life-giving Resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ from the dead.” This
therefore is in perfect accordance with that saying of Chrysostom, a
little before the end of the Homily, “Forty days have passed away.” This
sermon then was delivered on the Friday after the Sunday which we call
Passion-Sunday. For this day was the fortieth, beginning from the Monday
after Quinquagesima, which was the commencement of Lent. But it was
likewise the tenth before Easter, reckoning Easter itself with it. The
Homily is almost throughout against enmity and the remembrances of
injuries, and at the close is, according to Chrysostom’s accustomed
manner, directed against oaths. The twenty-first Homily, which is the
last on the Statues, seems, from what he says just <span
id="page_327">p. 327</span> <span id="xix.ii-Page_327"></span>at the
beginning, to have been delivered on the very day of the Lord’s
Resurrection, and after the return of Flavian the Bishop; whose journey
to the Emperor, and address to the same on behalf of the city’s
preservation, as well as the Emperor’s reply full of lenity in which he
pardons the citizens, are all particularly related by Chrysostom,
occupying the whole of this discourse. But even until the return of
Flavian, the people of Antioch were terrified by every day’s reports,
and fluctuated between hope and fear, as Chrysostom observes a little
after the beginning.

<span id="xix.ii-p13"></span> Pascha is either Passover or Easter. St.
Thos. Aquinas, in the Hymn *Lauda Sion*, appropriates it to the
Christian Festival, calling the Jewish *Phase vetus*.

<span id="fn_975"></span>[318:976](1090093.htm#fr_975.md) <span
id="xix.ii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="xix.ii-p14"></span> *i. e*., the actual days of them on the
Jewish computation. This appears the true answer to the difficulty. The
Jews kept the Passover this year *earlier* than the Christians: viz. on
the 14th day of the moon, or April 18. See *<span
id="xix.ii-p14.1"></span>l’Art de Verifier les Dates* on the year. Thus
the supposed difficulty becomes a confirmation of the date otherwise
determined. Montfaucon understood it, “we must…if we follow the
Judaizers.” Tillemont is at a loss to explain the title of Homily III.
against the Jews. *Against those who would fast the first Passover*. It
may mean either the *original*, or that which then happened to be the
earlier. The word *fast* is explained by taking it as their expression
for *keep*. He thinks it necessary to tell them that the true Passover
is not *fasting*, but the *Holy Communion*. Ben. t. i. p. 611, b. And
this agrees with what he says is the common case, viz. that the
Christian Easter is so much later, as is required to complete the week.

<span id="fn_976"></span>[319:977](1090093.htm#fr_976.md) <span
id="xix.ii-p15.1"></span>

<span id="xix.ii-p16"></span> The second before Easter. It has lately
become common to call the week immediately before Easter “Passion Week,”
but this name belongs to the week before it. The proper title of the
last is the “Great” or “Holy” Week.

<span id="fn_977"></span>[320:978](1090093.htm#fr_977.md) <span
id="xix.ii-p39.2"></span>

<span id="xix.ii-p40"></span> “*Feriam sextam Quadragesima*.” This looks
like a reprint, as he is more definite.

<span id="fn_978"></span>[320:979](1090093.htm#fr_978.md) <span
id="xix.ii-p40.1"></span>

<span id="xix.ii-p41"></span> As now in the Greek church. The Latins do
not count the week in which Ash-Wednesday is, as not being a whole one.

<span id="fn_979"></span>[320:980](1090093.htm#fr_979.md) <span
id="xix.ii-p42.1"></span>

<span id="xix.ii-p43"></span> It has been shewn, in a former note, that
there is no reason for this doubt.

<span id="fn_980"></span>[320:981](1090093.htm#fr_980.md) <span
id="xix.ii-p44.1"></span>

<span id="xix.ii-p45"></span> “*accepi,*” it should be, as in Text,
*“exegi,”* “I demanded.”

<span id="fn_981"></span>[322:982](1090093.htm#fr_981.md) <span
id="xix.ii-p50.1"></span>

<span id="xix.ii-p51"></span> Lat. has only “the day before yesterday.”

id="xix.ii-p53.1"></span>

<span id="xix.ii-p54"></span> This must be a slip of the pen. \[The
sentences have clearly got transposed, and we should read “not only good
when He confers favours, but also when He chastises.”—<span
class="c12"><span id="xix.ii-p54.1"></span>Ed</span>.\]

<span id="fn_983"></span>[322:984](1090093.htm#fr_983.md) <span
id="xix.ii-p55.3"></span>

<span id="xix.ii-p56"></span> Both arguments may stand, as the common
use of πρῴην is undoubted.

<span id="fn_984"></span>[322:985](1090093.htm#fr_984.md) <span
id="xix.ii-p57.1"></span>

<span id="xix.ii-p58"></span> By using the word πρῷην. But this may be
in anticipation of his reference to Hom. VII. But if this Homily were
delivered on Monday, the first day of *strict* fasting, the scruples of
the congregation would be accounted for. No difficulty remains but the
use of πρῷην, in Hom. X., against which is ἐπιοῦσαν. Placing the trials,
and Hom. XI.–XVIII. a week later throughout, seems less consistent.

<span id="fn_985"></span>[323:986](1090093.htm#fr_985.md) <span
id="xix.ii-p60.1"></span>

<span id="xix.ii-p61"></span> See note at the beginning of that Homily
and the preceding; it is almost certain from the whole character of Hom.
XVII. that it was not delivered immediately after the events referred
to. Probably many had returned, who St. Chrysostom wished to inform of
the events during their absence.

<span id="fn_986"></span>[324:987](1090093.htm#fr_986.md) <span
id="xix.ii-p64.4"></span>

<span id="xix.ii-p65"></span> See Sir H. Nicolas, *Chron. of History*,
p. 117. Gloss. of Dates, art. *Hebdomadæ Græcæ*, observes, that the
Greeks named the weeks as beginning on Monday, and taking in Sunday at
the end. Still they count Monday the second day, etc. Thus the first
*Sunday* would be the same as with the Latins, but the first *week*
earlier. It seems probable that this was a week earlier than here
stated, see Hom. XVIII.

<span id="fn_987"></span>[324:988](1090093.htm#fr_987.md) <span
id="xix.ii-p66.1"></span>

<span id="xix.ii-p67"></span> And dependent on the erroneous notions,
that Hom. XVII. was delivered immediately on the arrival of the
commissioners.
