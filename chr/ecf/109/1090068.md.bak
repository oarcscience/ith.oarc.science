id="xv.ii-p1.1"></span>INTRODUCTION TO THE TWO HOMILIES ON
EUTROPIUS.</span>

<span id="xv.ii-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="xv.ii-p2.1"></span>The</span> interest of the two following
discourses depends not only on their intrinsic value as specimens of
Chrysostom’s eloquence, but also on the singular and dramatic character
of the incidents which gave occasion to them.

<span id="xv.ii-p3"></span>Arcadius the Emperor of the East like his
brother Honorius the Emperor of the West was a man of feeble intellect.
The history of the Empire under his reign is a melancholy record of
imbecility on the part of the nominal rulers: of faithlessness and
unscrupulous ambition on the part of their ministers. The chief
administrator of affairs in the beginning of the reign of Arcadius was
Rufinus, an Aquitanian Gaul; the very model of an accomplished
adventurer. His intrigues, his arrogance, his rapacious avarice excited
the indignation of the people, and he was at last assassinated by the
troops to whom he was making an oration in the presence of the Emperor.
His place in the favour and confidence of Arcadius was soon occupied by
the eunuch Eutropius. The career of this person was a strange one. Born
a slave, in the region of Mesopotamia, he had passed in boyhood and
youth through the hands of many owners, performing the most menial
offices incident to his position. At length Arnithus, an old military
officer who had become his master, presented him to his daughter on her
marriage; and in the words of the poet Claudian, “the future consul of
the East was made over as part of a marriage dowry.” <span
id="fr_797"></span>[798](#fn_797.md) But the young lady after a time grew
tired of the slave who was becoming elderly and wrinkled, and without
trying to sell him turned him out of her household. He picked up a
precarious living in Constantinople and was often in great want until an
officer of the court took pity on him, and procured him a situation in
the lower ranks of the imperial chamberlains. This was the beginning of
his rise. By the diligence with which he discharged his humble duties,
by occasional witty sayings, and the semblance of a fervent piety he
attracted the notice of the great Emperor Theodosius (the father of
Arcadius), and gradually won his confidence so as to be employed on
difficult and delicate missions. On the death of Theodosius he became in
the capacity of grand chamberlain the intimate adviser and constant
attendant of Arcadius and the most subtle and determined rival of
Rufinus. It was by his contrivance that the scheme of Rufinus for
marrying his own daughter to the Emperor was defeated: and that Eudoxia
the daughter of a Frankish general was substituted for her. After the
murder of Rufinus the government was practically in his hands; but he
exercised his power more craftily than the vain and boastful Gaul. He
contrived at first to discharge all the duties which fell to his lot as
chamberlain with humble assiduity, and sought no other title than he
already possessed. Slowly but surely however he climbed to the summit of
power by the simple process of putting out of the way on various
pretexts all dangerous competitors. He deprived his victims of their
last hope of escape by abolishing the right of the Church to afford
shelter to fugitives. He sold the chief offices of the State, and the
command of the provinces to the highest bidders. By surrounding the
Emperor with a crowd of frivolous companions, by dissipating his mind
with a perpetual round of amusements, by taking him every spring to
Ancyra in Phrygia where he was subjected to the enervating influ<span
id="page_246">p. 246</span> <span id="xv.ii-Page_246"></span>ence of a
soft climate and luxurious style of living he made the naturally feeble
intellect of Arcadius more feeble still and withdrew it from the power
of every superior mind but his own. From the pettiest detail of domestic
life to the most important affairs of state, the wily minister at length
ruled supreme. Arcadius was little more than a magnificently dressed
puppet, and the eunuch slave was the real master of half the Roman
world. It was by his advice that on the death of Nectarius in 397 that
Chrysostom had been appointed, very much against his own will, to the
vacant See of Constantinople. If Eutropius expected to find a
complaisant courtier in the new Archbishop he certainly sustained a
severe disappointment. Some little pretences which he made of assisting
the work of the Church by patronising Chrysostom’s missionary projects
could not blind the Archbishop to the gross venality of his
administration, or exempt him from the censure and warning of one who
was too honest and bold to be any respecter of persons. In fact when the
Archbishop declaimed against the cupidity and oppressions of the rich it
was obvious to all that Eutropius was the most signal example of these
vices. At last the minister, not content to remain as he was—enjoying
the reality of power without the name—prepared the way for his own ruin
by inducing the Emperor to bestow on him the titles of Patrician and
Consul. The acquisition of these venerable names by the eunuch slave
caused a profound sensation of shame and indignation throughout the
Empire, but especially in the Western capital, where they were bound up
with all the noblest and most glorious memories in the history of the
Roman people. The name of Eutropius was omitted from the Fasti or
catalogue of consuls inscribed in the Capitol at Rome. Amidst the
general decadence and degeneracy of public spirit in the Empire the West
did not descend, could not have descended, to those depths of servile
adulation to which the Byzantines stooped at the inauguration of
Eutropius as Consul. The senate, and all the great officials military
and civil poured into the palace of the Cæsars to offer their homage,
and emulated each other in the honor of kissing the hand and even the
wrinkled visage of the eunuch. They saluted him as the bulwark of the
laws, and the second father of the Emperor. Statues of bronze or marble
were placed in various parts of the city representing him in the costume
of warrior or judge, and the inscriptions on them styled him third
founder of the city, after Byzas, and Constantine. No wonder that
Claudian declaimed with bitter sarcasm against “a Byzantine nobility and
Greek divinities” and invokes Neptune by a stroke of his trident to
unseat and submerge the degenerate city which had inflicted such a deep
disgrace on the Empire. <span id="fr_798"></span>[799](#fn_798.md) A blow
indeed was about to fall upon the eastern capital, directed not by the
hand of a mythic deity, but of a stout barbarian soldier. The
consequences of it were averted from the city only by the sacrifice of
the new consul upon whom it fell with crushing effect. He sank never to
rise again. Tribigild, a distinguished gothic soldier who had been
raised to the rank of Tribune in the Roman army, had demanded higher
promotion for himself and higher pay for a body of military colonists in
Phrygia of which he had the command. His petition had been coldly
dismissed by Eutropius; Tribigild resent the affront and with the troops
which he commanded broke into revolt. Eutropius entrusted the conduct of
an expedition against him to one of his favorites, who suffered a most
ignominious defeat in which he perished, and the greater part of his
army was cut to pieces. Constantinople was convulsed with terror and
indignation. Gäinas another Goth in command of the city troops declared
that he could do nothing to check the progress of the revolt unless
Eutropius was banished, the principal author of all the evils of the
State. His demand was backed by the Empress Eudoxia, who had experienced
much insolence from the minister. Eutropius was deprived of his official
dignity, his property was declared confiscated, and he was commanded to
quit the palace instantly under pain of death. Whither could the poor
wretch fly who was thus in a moment hurled from the pinnacle of power
into the lowest depths of degradation and destitu<span id="page_247">p.
247</span> <span id="xv.ii-Page_247"></span>tion. There was but one
place to which he could naturally turn in his distress—the sanctuary of
the Church; but by the cruel irony of his fate, a law of his own
devising here barred his entrance. Yet he knew that the law prohibiting
asylum had been resented and resisted by the Church and it might be that
the Archbishop would connive at the violation of the obnoxious measure
by the very person who had passed it. He resolved to make the
experiment. In the humblest guise of a suppliant, tears streaming down
his puckered cheeks, his scant grey hairs smeared with dust, he crept
into the Cathedral, drew aside the curtain in front of the altar and
clung to one of the columns which supported it. Here he was found by
Chrysostom in a state of pitiable and abject terror, for soldiers in
search of him had entered the Church, and the clattering of their arms
could be heard on the other side of the thin partition which concealed
the fugitive. With quivering lips he craved the asylum of the church,
and he was not repulsed as the destroyer of the refuge which he now
sought. <span id="fr_799"></span>[800](#fn_799.md) Chrysostom rejoiced in
the opportunity afforded to the church of taking a noble revenge on her
adversary. <span id="fr_800"></span>[801](#fn_800.md) He concealed
Eutropius in the sacristy, confronted his pursuers, and refused to
surrender him. “None shall violate the sanctuary save over my body: the
church is the bride of Christ who has entrusted her honor to me and I
will never betray it.” He desired to be conducted to the Emperor and
taken like a prisoner between two rows of spearmen from the Cathedral to
the palace <span id="fr_801"></span>[802](#fn_801.md) where he boldly
vindicated the church’s right of asylum in the presence of the Emperor.
Arcadius promised to respect the retreat of the fallen minister, and
with difficulty persuaded the angry troops to accept his decision. The
next day was Sunday, and the Cathedral was thronged with a vast
multitude eager to hear what the golden mouth of the Archbishop would
utter who had dared in defence of the Church’s right to defy the law,
and confront the tide of popular feeling. But few probably were prepared
to witness such a dramatic scene as was actually presented. The
Archbishop had just taken his seat in the “Ambon” or high reading desk a
little westward of the chancel from which he was wont to preach on the
account of his diminutive stature, and a sea of faces was upturned to
him waiting for the stream of golden eloquence when the curtain of the
sanctuary was drawn aside and disclosed the cowering form of the
miserable Eutropius clinging to one of the columns of the Holy Table.
Many a time had the Archbishop preached to unheeding ears on the vain
and fleeting character of worldly honor, prosperity, luxury, and wealth:
now he would force attention, and drive home his lesson to the hearts of
his vast congregation by pointing to a visible example of fallen
grandeur in the poor wretch who lay grovelling behind him.

<span id="xv.ii-p9"></span>Eutropius remained for some days within the
precincts of the Church and then suddenly departed. Whether he
mistrusted the security of his shelter and hoped to make his escape in
disguise, or whether he surrendered himself on the understanding that
exile would be substituted for capital punishment cannot be certainly
known. Chrysostom declared that if he had not abandoned the Church, the
Church would never have given him up. <span
id="fr_802"></span>[803](#fn_802.md) Anyhow he was captured and conveyed to
Cyprus, but soon afterwards he was tried at Constantinople on various
charges of high crimes and misdemeanors against the State, and condemned
to suffer capital punishment. He was taken to Chalcedon and there
beheaded. <span id="fr_803"></span>[804](#fn_803.md) The second of the two
following discourses was delivered a few days after Eutropius had
quitted the sanctuary of the Church.
