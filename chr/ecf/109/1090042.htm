<p class="c35"><a name="viii.ii-p4"></A><i>Against those who improperly use the apostolic declaration which says, &#8220;Whether in pretence, or in sincerity, Christ is preached:</i>&#8221; (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#018">Phil. i. 18</a><a name="viii.ii-p4.1"></A>), <i>and  about humbleness of mind.</i></p>  
<p class="c22"><a name="viii.ii-p5"></A><span class="c4"><a name="viii.ii-p5.1"></A>Introduction.</span></p>  
<p class="c37"><a name="viii.ii-p6"></A><span class="c12"><a name="viii.ii-p6.1"></A>There</span> is an allusion at the beginning of this Homily to some remarks recently made on the parable of the Pharisee and the Publican. These occur in Chrysostom&#146;s fifth Homily against the Anom&#339;ans, one of a set of Homilies which, from internal evidence, may be assigned to the close of the year 386, or beginning of 387. The following homily therefore was delivered at Antioch, probably just before Christmas 386. There were some persons who explained the words of St. Paul cited in the title as signifying that provided Christ was preached it mattered not whether the actual doctrines taught were true or heretical. The main object of the homily is to vindicate the language of the Apostle from this erroneous and mischievous interpretation.</p>
