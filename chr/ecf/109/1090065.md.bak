<span id="xiv.ii-p1"></span><span class="c30"><span
id="xiv.ii-p1.1"></span>against publishing the errors of the
brethren.</span>

<span id="xiv.ii-p2"></span>————————————

<span id="xiv.ii-p3"></span><span class="c17"><span
id="xiv.ii-p3.1"></span>HOMILY.</span>

<span id="xiv.ii-p4"></span>Upon the not publishing the errors of the
Brethren, nor uttering imprecations upon enemies.

<span id="xiv.ii-p5"></span>1. <span class="c12"><span
id="xiv.ii-p5.1"></span>I account</span> you happy for the zeal,
beloved, with which you flock into the Father’s house. For from this
zeal I have ground for feeling confidence about your health also with
respect to the soul; for indeed the school of the Church is an admirable
surgery—a surgery, not for bodies, but for souls. For it is spiritual,
and sets right, not fleshly wounds, but errors of the mind, <span
id="fr_768"></span>[769](#fn_768.md) and of these errors and wounds the
medicine is the word. This medicine is compounded, not from the herbs
growing on the earth, but from the words proceeding from heaven—this no
hands of physicians, but tongues of preachers have dispensed. On this
account it lasts right through; and neither is its virtue impaired by
length of time, nor defeated by any strength of diseases. For certainly
the medicines of physicians have both these defects; for while they are
fresh they display their proper strength, but when much time has passed;
just as those bodies which have grown old; they become weaker; and often
too the difficult character of maladies is wont to baffle them; since
they are but human. Whereas the divine medicine is not such as this; but
after much time has intervened, it still retains all its inherent
virtue. Ever since at least Moses was born (for from thence dates the
beginning of the Scripture) it has healed so many human beings; and not
only has it not lost its proper power, but neither has any disease ever
yet overcome it. This medicine it is not possible to get by payment of
silver; but he who has displayed sincerity of purpose and disposition
goes his way having it all. On account of this both rich and poor alike
obtain the benefit of this healing process. For where there is a
necessity to pay down money the man of large means indeed shares the
benefit; but the poor man often has to go away deprived of the gain,
since his income does not suffice him for the making up of the medicine.
But in this case, since it is not possible to pay down silver coin, but
it is needful to display faith and a good purpose, he who has paid down
these with forwardness of mind, this is he who most reaps the advantage;
since indeed these are the price paid for the medicinal treatment. And
the rich and the poor man share the benefit alike; or rather it is not
alike that they share the benefit, but often the poor man goes away in
the enjoyment of more. What ever can be the reason? It is because the
rich man, possessed beforehand by many thoughts, having the pride and
puffed-up temper belonging to wealthiness; living with carelessness and
lazy ease as companions, receives the medicine of the hearing of the
Scriptures not with much attention, nor with much earnestness; but the
poor man, far removed from delicate living and gluttony and indolence;
spending all his time in handicraft and honest labours; and gathering
hence much <span id="page_236">p. 236</span> <span
id="xiv.ii-Page_236"></span>love of wisdom for the soul; becomes thereby
more attentive and free from slackness, and is wont to give his mind
with more accurate care to all that is said: whence also, inasmuch as
the price he has paid is higher, the benefit which he departs having
reaped is greater.

<span id="xiv.ii-p7"></span>2. It is not as absolutely bringing an
accusation against those who are wealthy that I say all this; nor as
praising the poor without reference to circumstances: for neither is
wealth an evil, but the having made a bad use of wealth; nor is poverty
a virtue, but the having made a virtuous use of poverty. That rich man
who was in the time of Lazarus was punished, <span
id="fr_769"></span>[770](#fn_769.md) not because he was rich, but because
he was cruel and inhuman. And that poor man who rested in the bosom of
Abraham was praised, not because he was poor, but because he had borne
his poverty with thankfulness.

<span id="xiv.ii-p9"></span>For of things—(now attend carefully to this
saying; for it will avail to put into you sufficient religious
knowledge, and to cast out all unsound reasoning, and to bring about
your having your judgment right concerning the truth of things)—well, of
things some are by nature morally good, and others the contrary; and
others neither good nor evil, but they occupy the intermediate position.
A good thing piety is by nature, impiety an evil thing; a good thing
virtue, an evil thing wickedness; but wealth and poverty in themselves
are neither the one nor the other; but from the will of those who use
them they become either the one or the other. For if thou hast used thy
wealth for purposes of philanthropy, the thing becomes to thee a
foundation of good; but if for rapine and grasping and insolence, thou
hast turned the use of it to the direct opposite; but for this wealth is
not chargeable, but he who has used his wealth for insolence. So also we
may say of poverty: if thou have borne it nobly by giving thanks to the
Master, what has been done becomes to thee a cause and ground for
receiving crowns; but if on account of this thou blaspheme thy Creator,
and accuse Him for His providence, thou hast again used the thing to an
evil purpose. But just as in that case it is not wealth that is
responsible for the avarice, but the person who has made a bad use of
wealth, so also here we are not to lay the blame of the blasphemy on
poverty, but on him who did not choose to bear the thing in a sober
spirit. For in every case both the praise and the blame belong to our
own will and choice. Good is wealth, yet not absolutely, but to him only
to whom it is not sin; and again poverty is wicked, but not absolutely,
but only in the mouth of the impious, because he is discontented,
because he blasphemes, because he is indignant, because he accuses Him
who has made him.

<span id="xiv.ii-p10"></span>3. Let us not therefore accuse riches, nor
revile poverty absolutely, but those who do not will <span
id="fr_770"></span>[771](#fn_770.md) to use these virtuously; for the
things themselves lie in the middle. But as I was saying (for it is good
to return to the former subject), both rich and poor enjoy the benefit
of the medicines administered here with the same boldness and freedom;
and often the poor with more earnestness. For the special excellence of
the medicines is not this only, that they heal souls, that their virtue
is not destroyed by length of time, that they are not worsted by any
disease, that the benefit is publicly offered gratuitously, that the
healing treatment is on a footing of equality both for rich and poor—but
they have another quality also not inferior to these good points. Pray
of what character is this? It is that we do not publicly expose those
who come to this surgery. For they who go off to the surgeries of the
outside world, have many who examine their wounds, and unless the
physician have first uncovered the sore, he does not apply the dressing;
but here not so, but seeing as we do innumerable patients, we go through
the medical treatment of them in a latent manner. For not by dragging
into publicity those who have sinned do we thus noise abroad the sins
committed by them; but after putting forth our teaching, as common to
all, we leave it entirely to the conscience of the hearers; so that each
may draw to himself from what is said the suitable medicine for his own
wound. For there proceeds the word of doctrine from the tongue of the
speaker, containing accusation of wickedness, praise of virtue, blame of
lewdness, commendation of chasteness, censure of pride, praise of
gentleness, just as a medicine of varied and manifold ingredients,
compounded from every kind; and to take what is applicable to himself
and salutary is the part of each of the hearers. The word then issues
openly, and settling into the conscience of each, secretly both affords
the healing treatment which comes from it, and before the malady has
been divulged, has often restored health.

<span id="xiv.ii-p12"></span>4. You at all events heard yesterday how I
extolled the power of prayer, how I reproached those who pray with
listlessness; without having publicly exposed one of them. Those then
who were conscious to themselves of earnestness, accepted that
commendation of prayer, <span id="page_237">p. 237</span> <span
id="xiv.ii-Page_237"></span>and became still more earnest by the
praises, while those who were conscious to themselves of listlessness,
accepted on the other hand the rebuking, and put off their carelessness.
But neither these nor those do we know; and this ignorance is
serviceable to both—how, I now tell you. He who has heard the
commendations of prayer and is conscious to himself of earnestness, were
he to have many witnesses of the commendations, would have lapsed
towards pride; but, as it is, by having secretly accepted the praise, he
is removed from all arrogance. On the other hand he who is conscious to
himself of listlessness, having heard the accusation, has become better
from the accusation, as having no one of men a witness of the rebuking;
and this was of no ordinary profit to him. For on account of the being
flurried at the opinion of the vulgar, <span
id="fr_771"></span>[772](#fn_771.md) so long as we may think that we escape
notice in our wickedness, we exert ourselves to become better; but when
we have become notorious to all, and have lost the consolation derived
from the escaping notice, we grow more shameless and remiss rather. And
just as sores become more painful by being unbandaged and frequently
exposed to cold air, so also the soul after having sinned, if in the
presence of many it be rebuked for what it has done amiss, grows thereby
more shameless. In order therefore that this might not take place, the
word administered its medicine to you covertly. And that you may
understand <span id="fr_772"></span>[773](#fn_772.md) that the gain which
this covert treatment has is great, hear what the Christ says. “If thy
brother have committed a fault against thee convince him of it,” and he
did not say “between him and the whole town,” nor, “between thee and the
whole people,” <span id="fr_773"></span>[774](#fn_773.md) but “only between
thee and him.” Let the accusation, he says, be unwitnessed to, in order
that the change to amendment may be made easy of digestion. A great good
surely, the making the advice unpublished. Sufficient is the conscience,
sufficient that incorruptible judge. It is not so much thou who rebukest
him who has done wrong as his own conscience (that accuser is the
sharper), nor dost thou do it with the more exact knowledge of the
faults committed. Add not therefore wound to wound by exposing him who
has done wrong; but administer for thyself the counsel unwitnessed. This
therefore we are doing now—the very thing that Paul also did, framing
the indictment against him who among the Corinthians had sinned without
citing of witnesses. And hear how. “On this account,” he says,
“brethren, I have applied these figures of speech to myself and
Apollos.” And yet not he himself nor Apollos were they who had rent the
people in schism and divided the Church; but all the same he concealed
the accusation, and just as by some masks, by hiding the countenances of
the defendants by his own and Apollos’ names, he afforded them power to
amend of that wickedness. And again, “Lest in some way after I have come
God humble me, and I may have to mourn many of those who have before
sinned, and have not repented over the uncleanness and lasciviousness
which they had committed.” <span id="fr_774"></span>[775](#fn_774.md) See
how here also he indefinitely mentions those who had sinned, in order
that he might not, by openly bringing the accusation, render the soul of
those who had sinned more shameless. Therefore, just as we administer
our reproofs with so much sparing of your feelings, so do ye also with
all seriousness receive the correction; and attend with carefulness to
what is said.

<span id="xiv.ii-p17"></span>5. We discoursed to you yesterday about the
power which is in prayer. I pointed out <span
id="fr_775"></span>[776](#fn_775.md) how the devil then lies in wait,
deceiver that he is. For since he sees very great gain accruing to us
from prayer, then most he assails us, in order that he may disable us
from our defence; <span id="fr_776"></span>[777](#fn_776.md) that he may
send us off home empty-handed. And just as before magistrates, when the
officers of the court who are about the person of the magistrate have a
hostile feeling toward those who come before him, they by their staves
drive them away to a distance, preventing their coming near and
resorting to lamentation and so obtaining compassion; so also the devil,
when he has seen us coming to the judge, drives us away to a distance,
not by any staff, but through our own slackness. For he knows, he knows
clearly, that if they have come to him in a sober spirit, and have told
the sins committed, and have mourned with their soul fervent, they will
depart having received full forgiveness; for God loves mankind; and on
this account he is beforehand with them, and debars them from
access, <span id="fr_777"></span>[778](#fn_777.md) in order that they may
obtain no one of the things which they need. But the soldiers of
magistrates with violence scare away those who are coming to them; but
he with no compulsion, but by deceiving us, and throwing us into
security. On this account we are not deserving even of allowance, since
we voluntarily deprive ourselves of the good things. Prayer with <span
id="page_238">p. 238</span> <span
id="xiv.ii-Page_238"></span>earnestness is a light of the understanding
and soul—a light unquenchable and perpetual. On this account he throws
into our minds countless rubbish-heaps of imaginations; and things which
we never had imagined, these collecting together at the very moment of
prayer he pours down upon our souls. And just as winds often rushing
from an opposite quarter by a violent gust extinguish a lamp’s flame as
it is being lighted, so also the devil, when he has seen the flame of
our prayer being kindled, blowing it on every side with the blasts of
countless thoughts, does not desist before and until he has quenched the
light. But the very thing which they who are kindling those lamps do,
this let us also do. And what do they do? When they see a violent wind
coming, by laying their finger upon the opening of the lamp they bar the
entrance against the wind. For so long as he assails from without we
shall be able to stand against him; but when we have opened to him the
doors of the mind, and have received the enemy inside; after that we are
no longer able to withstand even a little; but, having on all sides
completely extinguished the memory, <span
id="fr_778"></span>[779](#fn_778.md) just as a smoking lamp, he allows our
mouth to utter empty words. But just as they put their finger upon the
opening of the lamp, so let us lay consideration upon our mind: let us
close off from the wicked spirit the entrance, in order that he may not
quench our light of prayer. Remember both those illustrations, both that
of the soldiers and the magistrate, and that respecting the lamp. For
with this purpose we adduce to you these illustrations; with which we
are conversant, in which we live, in order that, after we have departed
hence and have returned home, we may from things of familiar occurrence
receive a reminder of what has been said.

<span id="xiv.ii-p22"></span>6. Prayer is a strong piece of armour and a
great security. You heard yesterday how the three children, fettered as
they were, destroyed the power of the fire; how they trampled down the
blaze; how they overcame the furnace, and conquered the operation of the
element. Hear to-day again how the noble and great Isaac overcame the
nature itself of bodies through prayer. They destroyed <span
id="fr_779"></span>[780](#fn_779.md) the power of fire, this man to-day
loosed the bonds of incapacitated nature. And learn how he effected
this. “Isaac,” it says, “prayed <span id="fr_780"></span>[781](#fn_780.md)
concerning his wife, because she was barren.” This has to-day been read
to you; yesterday the sermon was about prayer; and to-day again there is
a demonstration of the power of prayer. See how the grace of the Spirit
has ordered that what has been read to-day harmonises with what was said
yesterday. “Isaac,” it says, “prayed concerning Rebecca his wife,
because she was barren.” This first is worth inquiring into, for what
cause she was barren. She was of a life admirable and replete with much
chastity—both herself and her husband. We cannot lay hold <span
id="fr_781"></span>[782](#fn_781.md) of the life of those just ones, and
say that the barrenness was the work of sin. And not only was she
herself barren, but also his mother Sarah, who had borne him; not only
was his mother barren and his wife, but also his daughter-in-law, the
wife of Jacob, Rachel. What is the meaning of this band of barren ones?
All were righteous, all living in virtue, all were witnessed to by God.
For it was of them that He said, “I am the God of Abraham, and the God
of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.” Of the same persons Paul also thus
speaks. “For which cause God is not ashamed to call himself their
God.” <span id="fr_782"></span>[783](#fn_782.md) Many are the commendations
of them in the New, many the praises of them in the Old Testament. On
all sides they were bright and illustrious, and yet they all had barren
wives, and continued in childlessness until an advanced period. When
therefore thou seest man and wife living with virtue; when thou seest
them beloved of God, caring for piety, and yet suffering the malady of
childlessness; do not suppose that the childlessness is at all a
retribution for sins. For many are God’s reasons for the dispensation,
and to us inexplicable; and for all we must be heartily thankful, and
think those only wretched who live in wickedness; not those who do not
possess children. Often God does it expediently, though we know not the
cause of events. On this account in every case it is our duty to admire
His wisdom, and to glorify His unspeakable love of man.

<span id="xiv.ii-p27"></span>7. Well, <span
id="fr_783"></span>[784](#fn_783.md) this consideration indeed is able to
school us in moral character, but it is necessary also to state the
cause for which those women were barren. What then was the cause? It was
in order that when thou hast seen the Virgin bringing forth our common
Master, thou mightest not disbelieve. Wherefore exercise thy mind in the
womb of the barren; in order that when thou hast seen the womb, disabled
and bound as it is, being opened to the bearing of children from the
grace of God, thou mightest not marvel at hearing that a virgin has
brought forth. Or rather even marvel and be astounded; but do not
disbelieve the marvel. When the Jew says to thee, “how did the virgin
bear?” say to him “how did she bear who was barren and <span
id="page_239">p. 239</span> <span id="xiv.ii-Page_239"></span>enfeebled
by old age?” There were then two hindrances, both the unseasonableness
of her age and the unserviceableness of nature; but in the case of the
Virgin there was one hindrance only, the not having shared in marriage.
The barren one therefore prepares the way for the virgin. And that thou
mayest learn that it was on this account that the barren ones had
anticipated it, in order that the Virgin’s childbirth might be believed,
hear the words of Gabriel which were addressed to her—For when he had
come and said to her, “thou shalt conceive in the womb and bear a son,
and thou shalt call his name Jesus;” the Virgin was astonished and
marvelled, and said, “how will this be to me, since I know not a man.”
What then said the Angel? “The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee.” Seek
not the sequence of nature, he says, when that which takes place is
above nature; look not round for marriage and throes of child-birth,
when the manner of the birth is too grand for marriage. “And how will
this be,” she says, “since I know not a husband.” And verily on this
account shall this be, since thou knowest no husband. For didst thou
know a husband, thou wouldest not have been deemed worthy to serve this
ministry. So that, for the reason why thou disbelievest, for this
believe. And thou wouldest not have been deemed worthy to serve this
ministry, not because marriage is an evil; but because virginity is
superior; and right it was that the entry of the Master should be more
august than ours; for it was royal, and the king enters through one more
august. It was necessary that He should both share as to birth, and be
diverse from ours. Wherefore both these things are managed.

<span id="xiv.ii-p29"></span>For the being born from the womb is common
in respect to us, but the being born without marriage is a thing greater
than on a level with us. And the gestation and conception in the belly
belongs to human nature; but that the pregnancy should take place
without sexual intercourse is too august for human nature. <span
id="fr_784"></span>[785](#fn_784.md) And for this purpose both these things
took place, in order that thou mayest learn both the pre-eminence and
the fellowship with thee of Him who was born.

<span id="xiv.ii-p31"></span>8. And pray consider the wisdom of all that
was done. Neither did the pre-eminence injure the likeness and kinship
to us, nor did the kinship to us dim the pre-eminence; but both were
displayed by all the circumstances; and the one had our condition in its
entirety, and the other what was diverse compared with us. But just as I
was saying, on this account the barren ones went before, in order that
the Virgin’s child-birth might be believed, that she <span
id="fr_785"></span>[786](#fn_785.md) might be led by the hand to faith in
that promise and undertaking which she heard from the angel, saying,
“The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the miraculous power <span
id="fr_786"></span>[787](#fn_786.md) of the Most High shall overshadow
thee”—thus, he says, thou art able to bear. Look not to the earth; it is
from the heavens that the operation will come. That which takes place is
a grace of the Spirit; pray inquire not about nature and laws of
marriage. But since those words were too high for her, he wills to
afford also another demonstration. But do thou, pray, observe how the
barren one leads her on the way to the belief in this. For since that
demonstration was too high for the Virgin’s intelligence, hear how he
brought down what he said to lower things also, leading her by the hand
by sensible facts. For “behold,” he says, “Elizabeth thy kinswoman—she
also has conceived a son in her old age; and this month is the sixth to
her who was called barren.” Seest thou that the barren one was for the
sake of the Virgin? since with what object did he adduce to her the
child-bearing of her kinswoman? with what object did he say, “in her old
age?” with what object did he add, “who was called barren?” It was by
way of inducing her by all these things, manifestly, to the believing
the glad annunciation. For this cause he spoke of both the age and the
disabling effect of nature; for this cause he awaited the time also
which had elapsed from the conception; for he did not tell to her the
glad tidings immediately from the beginning, <span
id="fr_787"></span>[788](#fn_787.md) but awaited for a six-months period to
have passed to the barren one, in order that the puerperal swelling
might, for the rest, be a pledge of the pregnancy, and an indisputable
demonstration might arise of the conception. And pray again look at the
intelligence of Gabriel. For he neither reminded her <span
id="fr_788"></span>[789](#fn_788.md) of Sarah, nor of Rebecca, nor of
Rachel; and yet they also were barren, and they had grown old, and that
which took place was a marvel; but the stories were ancient. Now things
new and recent and occurring in our generation are wont to induce us
into the belief of marvels more than those which are old. On this
account having let those women alone, that she should understand from
her kinswoman Elizabeth herself what was coming upon her, he brought it
forward; so as from her to lead her to her own—that most awful and
august childbirth. For the child-birth of the barren one lay between
ours and that of the Master less indeed than that of the Virgin, but
greater <span id="page_240">p. 240</span> <span
id="xiv.ii-Page_240"></span>than ours. On this account it was by
Elizabeth lying between, just as by some bridge, that he lifted up the
mind of the Virgin from the travail which is according to nature, to
that which is above nature.

<span id="xiv.ii-p36"></span>9. I did desire to say more, and to teach
you other reasons for which Rebecca, and Rachel, were barren; but the
time does not permit; urging on the discourse to the power of prayer.
For on this account indeed I have mooted all these points, that ye might
understand how the prayer of Isaac unbound the barrenness of his wife;
and that prayer for so long a time. “Isaac,” it says, “continually
prayed about Rebecca his wife, and God listened to him.” For do not
suppose that he invoked God and had immediately been listened to; for he
had spent much time in praying to God. And if you desire to learn how
much, I will tell you this too with exactness. He had spent the number
of twenty years in praying to God. Whence is this manifest? from the
sequence itself. For the Scripture, desiring to point out the faith and
the endurance and the love of wisdom of that righteous man, did not
break off and leave untold even the time, but made it also clear to us,
covertly indeed, so as to rouse up our indolence; but nevertheless did
not allow it to be uncertain. Hear then how it covertly indicated to us
the time. “Now Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebecca, a
daughter of Bethuel the Syrian.” You hear how many years old he was when
he brought home his wife: “Forty years old,” it says, “he was when he
took Rebecca.” But since we have learnt how many years old he was when
he married his wife, let us learn also when he after all became a
father, and how many years old he was then, when he begat Jacob; and we
shall be able to see how long a time his wife had remained barren; and
that during all that time he continued to pray to God. How many years
old then was he when he begat Jacob? “Jacob,” it says, “came forth
laying hold with his right hand of his brother’s heel: on this account
he called him Jacob, and him Esau. Now Isaac was sixty years old when he
begat them.” If therefore when he brought Rebecca home he was forty
years old, and when he begat the sons sixty, it is very plain that his
wife had remained barren for twenty years between, and during all this
time Isaac continued to pray to God.

<span id="xiv.ii-p37"></span>10. After this do we not feel shame, and
hide our faces, at seeing that righteous man for twenty years
persevering <span id="fr_789"></span>[790](#fn_789.md) and not desisting;
we ourselves after a first or second petition often fainting and
indignant? And yet he indeed had in large measure liberty of speech
towards God, <span id="fr_790"></span>[791](#fn_790.md) and all the same he
felt no discontent at the delay of the giving, but remained patient,
whereas we, laden with countless sins, living with an evil conscience,
displaying no good will towards the Master; if we are not heard before
having spoken, are bewildered, impatiently recoil, desist from asking—on
this account we always retire with empty hands. Who has for twenty years
besought God for one thing, as this righteous man did? or rather who for
twenty months only? Yesterday I was saying that they are many who pray
with slackness, and yawning, and stretching themselves, and continually
shifting their attitude, and indulging in every carelessness in their
prayers—but to-day I have found also another damage attaching itself to
their prayers more destructive than that one. For many, throwing
themselves prostrate, and striking the ground with their forehead, and
pouring forth hot tears, and groaning bitterly from the heart <span
id="fr_791"></span>[792](#fn_791.md) and stretching out their hands, and
displaying much earnestness, employ this warmth and forwardness against
their own salvation. For it is not on behalf of their own sins that they
beseech God; nor are they asking forgiveness of the offences committed
by them; but they are exerting this earnestness against their enemies
entirely, doing just the same thing as if one, after whetting his sword,
were not to use the weapon against his enemies, but to thrust it through
his own throat. So these also use their prayers not for the remission of
their own sins, but about revenge on their enemies; which is to thrust
the sword against themselves. This too the wicked one has devised, in
order that on all sides we may destroy ourselves, both through slackness
and through earnestness. For the one class by their carelessness in
their prayers exasperate God, by displaying contempt through their
slackness; and the others, when they display earnestness, display the
earnestness on the other hand against their own salvation. “A certain
person,” he (the devil) says, “is slack: that is sufficient for me with
a view to his obtaining nothing; this man is earnest and thoroughly
aroused; what then must be done to accomplish the same result? I cannot
slacken his earnestness, nor throw him into carelessness; I will
contrive his de<span id="page_241">p. 241</span> <span
id="xiv.ii-Page_241"></span>struction in the other way. How so? I will
manage that he use his earnestness for transgressing the law:” (for the
praying against one’s personal enemies is a transgression of law). “He
shall depart therefore not only having gained nothing by his
earnestness, but also having endured the hurt which is greater than that
caused through slackness.” Such as these are the injuries of the devil:
the one sort he destroys through their remissness; and the other through
their earnestness itself, when it is shown not according to God’s laws.

<span id="xiv.ii-p41"></span>11. But it is also worth hearing the very
words of their prayer, and how the words are of a puerile mind; of how
infantile a soul. I am ashamed in truth when about to repeat them; but
it is absolutely necessary to repeat them, and to imitate that coarse
tongue. What then are the words? “Avenge me of my enemies, show them
that I too have God (on my side).” They do not then learn, man, that we
have God, when we are indignant and angry and impatient; but when we are
gentle and meek and subdued, and practise all love of wisdom. So also
God said, “Let your light shine before men, that they may see your good
works, and glorify your Father who is in the heavens.” <span
id="fr_792"></span>[793](#fn_792.md) Perceivest thou not that it is an
insult to God, the making a request to God against thine enemies? And
how is it an insult? one will say. Because He Himself said, “pray for
your enemies;” and brought in this divine law. When therefore thou
claimest that the legislator should relax his own laws; and callest upon
him to legislate in opposition to himself; and supplicatest him who had
forbidden thee to pray against thine enemies to hear thee praying
against thine enemies; thou art not praying in doing this, nor calling
upon him; but thou art insulting the lawgiver, and acting with drunken
violence towards him, who is sure to give to thee the good things which
result from prayer. And how is it possible to be heard when praying,
tell me, when thou exasperatest him who is sure to hear? For by doing
these things thou art pushing thine own salvation into a pit, and art
rushing down a precipice, by striking thine enemy before the king’s
eyes. <span id="fr_793"></span>[794](#fn_793.md) For even if thou doest not
this with the hands, with thy words thou strikest him, the thing which
thou darest not do even in the case of thy fellow-slaves. At least dare
to do this in a ruler’s presence, and though thou hast done countless
public services, thou wilt straightway surely be led away to execution.
Then (I ask) in the presence of a ruler dost thou not dare to insult
thine equal, but when doing this in God’s presence, tell me, dost thou
not shudder, nor fear when in the time of entreaty and prayer being so
savage and turning thyself into a wild beast; and displaying greater
want of feeling than he who demanded payment of the hundred pence? <span
id="fr_794"></span>[795](#fn_794.md) For that thou art more insolent than
he, listen to the story itself. A certain man owed ten thousand talents
to his master; then, not having (wherewith) to pay, he entreated him to
be long-suffering, in order that, his wife having been sold and his
house and his children, he might settle his master’s claim. And the
master seeing him lamenting had compassion on him, and remitted the ten
thousand talents. He having gone out and found another servant owing him
a hundred pence, seizing his throat demanded them with great cruelty and
inhumanity. The Master having heard this threw him into the prison, and
laid on him again the debt of the ten thousand talents which he had
before remitted; and he paid the penalty of the cruelty shown towards
his fellow-servant.

<span id="xiv.ii-p45"></span>12. Now do thou consider in how much more
unfeeling and insensible in a way thou hast acted even than he, praying
against thine enemies. He did not beg his master to demand, but he
himself demanded, the hundred pence; whereas thou even callest on the
Master for this shameless and forbidden demand. And he seized his
fellow-servant’s throat not before his lord’s eyes, but outside; while
thou in the very moment of prayer, standing in the King’s presence,
doest this. And if he, for doing this without either having urged his
master to the demand, and after going forth, met with no forgiveness;
thou, both stirring up the Master to (exacting) this forbidden payment,
and doing this before his eyes, what sort of penalty will thou have to
pay? tell me. But thy mind is inflamed by the memory of the enmity, and
swells, and thy heart rises, <span id="fr_795"></span>[796](#fn_795.md) and
when recurring in memory to him who has caused pain, thou art unable to
reduce the swelling of thy thought. But set against this inflammation
the memory resulting from thine own sins committed the fear resulting
from the punishment to come. Recall to memory for how many things thou
art accountable to thy master, and that for all those things thou owest
Him satisfaction; and this fear will surely overcome that anger; since
indeed this is far more powerful than that passion. Recall the memory of
hell and punishment and vengeance during the time of thy prayer; and
thou wilt not be able even to receive thine enemy into <span
id="page_242">p. 242</span> <span id="xiv.ii-Page_242"></span>thy
mind. <span id="fr_796"></span>[797](#fn_796.md) Make thy mind contrite,
humble thy soul by the memory of the offences committed by thee, and
wrath will not be able even to trouble thee. But the cause of all these
evils is this, that we scrutinise the sins of all others with great
exactitude; while we let our own pass with great remissness. Whereas we
ought to do the contrary—to keep our own faults unforgotten; but never
even to admit a thought of those of others. If we do this we shall both
have God propitious, and shall cease cherishing immortal anger against
our neighbours, and we shall never have any one as an enemy; and even if
we should have at any time we shall both quickly put an end to his
enmity, and should obtain speedy pardon for our own sins. For just as he
who treasures up the memory of wrong against his neighbour does not
permit the punishment upon his own sins to be done away; so he who is
clear of anger will speedily be clear of sins also. For if we, wicked as
we are and enslaved to passion, on account of the commandment of God
overlook all the faults committed against us, much more will He who is a
lover of mankind, and good, and free from any passion, overlook our
delinquencies, rendering to us the recompense of our kindly spirit
towards our neighbour in the forgiveness of our own sins: which God
grant that we may attain, by the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord
Jesus Christ, to whom is the glory and the dominion, to the ages of the
ages. Amen.
