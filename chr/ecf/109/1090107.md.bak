<span id="xix.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c17"><span
id="xix.xvi-p1.1"></span>Homily XIV.</span>

<span id="xix.xvi-p2"></span>After the whole people had been freed from
all distress, and had become assured of safety, certain persons again
disturbed the city by fabricating false reports, and were convicted.
Wherefore this Homily refers to that subject; and also to the admonition
concerning oaths; for which reason also, the history of Jonathan, and
Saul, and that of Jephthah, is brought forward; and it is shewn how many
perjuries result from one oath.

<span id="xix.xvi-p3"></span>1. <span class="c12"><span
id="xix.xvi-p3.1"></span>Not</span> a little did the devil yesterday
disturb our city; but God also hath not a little comforted us again; so
that each one of us may seasonably take up that prophetic saying, “In
the multitude of the sorrows that I had in my heart, thy comforts have
refreshed my soul.” <span id="fr_1573"></span>[1574](#fn_1573.md) And not
only in consoling, but even in permitting us to be troubled, God hath
manifested His tender care towards us. For to-day I shall repeat what I
have never ceased to say, that not only our deliverance from evils, but
also the permission of them arises from the benevolence of God. For when
He sees us falling away into listlessness, and starting off from
communion with Him, and making no account of spiritual things, He leaves
us for a while; that thus brought to soberness, we may return to Him the
more earnestly. And what marvel is it, if He does this towards us,
listless as we are; since even Paul declares that with regard to himself
and his disciples, this was the cause of their trials? For inditing his
second Epistle to the Corinthians, he speaks thus: “We would not,
brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia,
that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, insomuch that we
despaired even of life; but we had the sentence of death in
ourselves.” <span id="fr_1574"></span>[1575](#fn_1574.md) As though he
would say, “Dangers so great hung over us, that we gave up ourselves for
lost; and no longer hoped that any favourable change would take place,
but were altogether in expectation of death.” For such is the sense of
that clause, “We had the sentence of death in ourselves.” But
nevertheless, after such a state of desperation, God dispelled the
tempest, and removed the cloud, and snatched us from the very gates of
death. And afterwards, for the purpose of shewing that his being
permitted to fall into this danger also was the result of much tender
care for him, he mentions the advantage which resulted from the
temptations, which was, that he might continually look to Him, and be
neither high-minded, nor confident. Therefore having said this, “We had
the sentence of death in ourselves;” <span
id="fr_1575"></span>[1576](#fn_1575.md) he adds also the reason; “That we
should not trust in ourselves, but in God which quickeneth the dead.”
For it is in the nature of trials to arouse us when we are dozing, or
falling down, and to stir us up, and make us more religious. When,
therefore, O beloved! thou seest a trial at one time extinguished, and
at another time kindled again, be not cast down! Do not despond, but
retain a favourable hope, reasoning thus with thyself, that God does not
deliver us into the hands of our enemies either because He hates or
abandons us, but because He is desirous to make us more in earnest, and
more intimate with Himself.

<span id="xix.xvi-p7"></span>2. Let us not then be desponding; nor let
us despair of a change for the better; but let us hope that speedily
there will be a calm; and, in short, casting the issue of all the
tumults which beset us upon God, let us again handle the customary
points; and again bring forward our usual topic of instruction. For I am
desirous to discourse to you further concerning the same subject, to the
end that we may radically extirpate from your souls the wicked practice
of oaths. Wherefore it is necessary for me again to have recourse to the
same entreaty that I made before. For <span id="page_432">p. 432</span>
<span id="xix.xvi-Page_432"></span>lately I besought you, that each one
taking the head of John, just cut off, and the warm blood yet dripping
from it, you would thus go home, and think that you saw it before your
eyes, while it emitted a voice, and said, “Abhor my murderer, the oath!”
What a rebuke did not effect, this an oath effected; what a tyrant’s
wrath was insufficient for, this the necessity of keeping an oath
brought about! And when the tyrant was publicly rebuked in the hearing
of all, he bore the censure nobly; but when he had thrown himself into
the fatal necessity caused by oaths, then he cut off that blessed head.
This same thing, therefore, I entreat; and cease not entreating, that
wherever we go, we go bearing this head; and that we shew it to all,
crying aloud, as it does, and denouncing oaths. For although we were
never so listless and remiss, yet beholding the eyes of that head
fearfully glaring upon us, and threatening us if we swear, we should be
more powerfully kept in check by this terror, than by any curb; and be
easily able to restrain and avert the tongue from its inclination toward
oaths.

<span id="xix.xvi-p8"></span>3. There is not only this great evil in an
oath, that it punishes those who are guilty of it, both when violated,
and when kept; a thing we do not see take place with any other sin; but
there is another equally great evil attending it. And what is that? Why
that ofttimes it is utterly impossible even for those who are desirous,
and even make a point of it, to keep their oath. For, in the first
place, he who is continually swearing, whether willingly or unwillingly;
knowingly or unknowingly; in jest or in earnest; being frequently
carried away by anger and by many other things, will most surely become
perjured. And no one can gainsay this; so evident and generally allowed
is the fact, that the man who swears frequently, must also be a
perjurer. Secondly, I affirm, that although he were not carried away by
passion, and did not become the victim of perjury <span
id="fr_1576"></span>[1577](#fn_1576.md) unwillingly and unwittingly, yet by
the very nature of the case he will assuredly be necessitated both
consciously and voluntarily to perjure himself. Thus, oftentimes when we
are dining at home, and one of the servants happens to do amiss, the
wife swears that he shall be flogged, and then the husband swears the
contrary, resisting, and not permitting it. In this case, whatever they
may do, perjury must in any case be the result; for however much they
may wish and endeavour to keep their oaths, it is no longer possible;
but whatever happens, one or other of these will be ensnared in perjury;
or rather both in any case.

<span id="xix.xvi-p10"></span>4. And how, I will explain; for this is
the paradox. He who hath sworn that he would flog the man-servant or
maid-servant, yet hath afterwards been prohibited from this, hath
perjured himself, not having done what he hath sworn to do: and also, he
hath involved in the crime of perjury the party forbidding and hindering
the oath from being kept. For not only they who take a false oath, but
they who impose that necessity on others, are liable to the same
accusation. And not merely in houses, but also in the forum we may see
that this takes place; and especially in fights, when those who box with
one another swear things that are contrary. One swears that he will
beat, the other that he will not be beaten. One swears that he will
carry off the cloak, the other that he will not suffer this. One that he
will exact the money, the other that he will not pay it. And many other
such contradictory things, those who are contentious take an oath to do.
So also in shops, and in schools, it may generally be observed that the
same thing occurs. Thus the workman hath often sworn that he will not
suffer his apprentice <span id="fr_1577"></span>[1578](#fn_1577.md) to eat
or drink, before he has finished all his assigned task. And so also the
pedagogue has often acted towards a youth; and a mistress towards her
maid-servant; and when the evening hath overtaken them, and the work
hath remained unfinished, it is necessary either that those who have not
executed their task should perish with hunger, or that those who have
sworn should altogether forswear themselves. For that malignant demon,
who is always lying in wait against our blessings, being present and
hearing the obligation of the oaths, impels those who are answerable to
indifference; or works some other difficulty; so that the task being
unperformed, blows, insults, and perjuries, and a thousand other evils,
may take place. And just as when children drag with all their might a
long and rotten cord in directions opposite to each other; if the cord
snaps in the middle, they all fall flat upon their backs, and some
strike their heads, and some another part of the body; so also they who
each engage with an oath to perform things that are contrary, when the
oath is broken by the necessity of the case, both parties fall into the
same gulf of perjury: these by actually perjuring themselves, and those
by affording the occasion of perjury to the others.

<span id="xix.xvi-p12"></span>5. That this also may be rendered evident,
<span id="page_433">p. 433</span> <span id="xix.xvi-Page_433"></span>not
only from what happens every day in private houses, and the places of
public concourse, but from the Scriptures themselves, I will relate to
you a piece of ancient history, which bears upon what has been said.
Once, when the Jews had been invaded by their enemies, and Jonathan (now
he was the son of Saul) had slaughtered some, and put the rest to
flight; Saul, his father, being desirous to rouse the army more
effectually against the remainder; and in order that they might not
desist until he had subjugated them all, did that which was altogether
opposite to what he desired, by swearing that no one should eat any food
until evening, and until vengeance was taken of his enemies. What, I
ask, could have been more senseless than this? For when it was needful
that he should have refreshed those who were fatigued and exhausted, and
have sent them forth with renewed vigour against their enemies, he
treated them far worse than he had done their enemies, by the constraint
of an oath, which delivered them over to excessive hunger. Dangerous,
indeed, it is for any one to swear in a matter pertaining to himself;
for we are forcibly impelled to do many things by the urgency of
circumstances. But much more dangerous is it by the obligation of one’s
own oath, to bind the determination of others; and especially where any
one swears, not concerning one, or two, or three, but an unlimited
multitude, which Saul then inconsiderately did, without thinking that it
was probable that, in so vast a number, one at least might transgress
the oath; or that soldiers, and soldiers too on campaign, are very far
removed from moral wisdom, and know nothing of ruling the belly; more
especially when their fatigue is great. He, however, overlooking all
these points, as if he were merely taking an oath about a single
servant, whom he was easily able to restrain, counted equally on his
whole army. In consequence of this he opened such a door for the devil,
that in a short time he framed, not two, three, or four, but many more
perjuries out of this oath. For as when we do not swear at all, we close
the whole entrance against him, so if we utter but a single oath, we
afford him great liberty for constructing endless perjuries. And just as
those who twist skeins, if they have one to hold the end, work the whole
string with nicety, but if there is no one to do this, cannot even
undertake the commencement of it; in the same manner too the devil, when
about to twist the skein of our sins, if he could not get the beginning
from our tongues, would not be able to undertake the work; but should we
only make a commencement, while we hold the oath on our tongue, as it
were a hand, then with full liberty he manifests his malignant art in
the rest of the work, constructing and weaving from a single oath a
thousand perjuries.

<span id="xix.xvi-p13"></span>6. And this was just what he did now in
the case of Saul. Observe, however, what a snare is immediately framed
for this oath: “The army passed through a wood, that contained a nest of
bees, and the nest was in front of the people, <span
id="fr_1578"></span>[1579](#fn_1578.md) and the people came upon the nest,
and went along talking.” <span id="fr_1579"></span>[1580](#fn_1579.md)
Seest thou what a pit-fall was here? A table ready spread, that the
easiness of access, the sweetness of the food, and the hope of
concealment, might entice them to a transgression of the oath. For
hunger at once, and fatigue, and the hour, (for “all the land,” it is
said, “was dining),” <span id="fr_1580"></span>[1581](#fn_1580.md) then
urged them to the transgression. Moreover, the sight of the combs
invited them from without to relax the strain on their resolution. For
the sweetness, as well as the present readiness of the table, and the
difficulty of detecting the stealth, were sufficient to ensnare their
utmost wisdom. If it had been flesh, which needed boiling or roasting,
their minds would not have been so much bewitched; since while they were
delaying in the cookery of these, and engaged in preparing them for
food, they might expect to be discovered. But now there was nothing of
this kind; there was honey only, for which no such labour was required,
and for which the dipping of the tip of the finger sufficed to partake
of the table, and that with secresy. Nevertheless, these persons
restrained their appetite, and did not say within themselves, “What does
it concern us? Hath any one of us sworn this? He may pay the penalty of
his inconsiderate oath, for why did he swear?” Nothing of this sort did
they think; but religiously passed on; and though there were so many
enticements, they behaved themselves wisely. “The people went on
talking.” <span id="fr_1581"></span>[1582](#fn_1581.md) What is the meaning
of this word “talking?” Why, that for the purpose of soothing their pain
with words, they held discourse with one another.

<span id="xix.xvi-p18"></span>7. What then, did nothing more come of
<span id="page_434">p. 434</span> <span
id="xix.xvi-Page_434"></span>this, when all the people had acted so
wisely? Was the oath, forsooth, observed? Not even so was it observed.
On the contrary, it was violated! How, and in what way? Ye shall hear
forthwith, in order that ye may also thoroughly discern the whole art of
the devil. For Jonathan, not having heard his father take the oath, “put
forth the end of the rod that was in his hand, and dipped it in the
honeycomb, and his eyes saw clearly.” <span
id="fr_1582"></span>[1583](#fn_1582.md) Observe, who it was whom he
impelled to break the oath; not one of the soldiers, but the very son of
him who had sworn it. For he did not only desire to effect perjury, but
was also plotting the slaughter of a son, and making provision for it
beforehand; and was in haste to divide nature against her own self. and
what he had done aforetime in the case of Jephthah, that he hoped now
again to accomplish. For he likewise, when he had promised that the
first thing that met him, after a victorious battle, he would
sacrifice, <span id="fr_1583"></span>[1584](#fn_1583.md) fell into the
snare of child-murder; for his daughter first meeting him, he sacrificed
her and God did not forbid it. And I know, indeed, that many of the
unbelievers impugn us of cruelty and inhumanity on account of this
sacrifice; but I should say, that the concession <span
id="fr_1584"></span>[1585](#fn_1584.md) in the case of this sacrifice was a
striking example of providence and clemency; and that it was in care for
our race that He did not prevent that sacrifice. For if after that vow
and promise He had forbidden the sacrifice, many also who were
subsequent to Jephthah, in the expectation that God would not receive
their vows, would have increased the number of such vows, and proceeding
on their way would have fallen into child-murder. But now, by suffering
this vow to be actually fulfilled, <span
id="fr_1585"></span>[1586](#fn_1585.md) He put a stop to all such cases in
future. And to shew that this is true, after Jephthah’s daughter had
been slain, in order that the calamity might be always remembered, and
that her fate might not be consigned to oblivion, it became a law among
the Jews, that the virgins assembling at the same season should bewail
during forty <span id="fr_1586"></span>[1587](#fn_1586.md) days the
sacrifice which had taken place; in order that renewing the memory of it
by lamentation, they should make all men wiser for the future; and that
they might learn that it was not after the mind of God that this should
be done, for in that case He would not have permitted the virgins to
bewail and lament her. And that what I have said is not conjectural, the
event demonstrated; for after this sacrifice, no one vowed such a vow
unto God. Therefore also He did not indeed forbid this; but what He had
expressly enjoined in the case of Isaac, that He directly
prohibited; <span id="fr_1587"></span>[1588](#fn_1587.md) plainly shewing
through both cases, that He doth not delight in such sacrifices.

<span id="xix.xvi-p25"></span>8. But the malignant demon was labouring
hard now again to produce such a tragedy. Therefore he impelled Jonathan
to the trespass. For if any one of the soldiers had transgressed the
law, it seemed to him no great evil that would have been done; but now
being insatiate of human ills, and never able to get his fill of our
calamities, he thought it would be no grand exploit if he effected only
a simple murder. And if he could not also pollute the king’s right hand
with the murder of his child, he considered that he had achieved no
great matter. And why do I speak of child-murder? For he, the wicked
one, thought that by this means he should compass a slaughter even more
accursed than that. For if he had sinned wittingly, and been sacrificed,
this would only have been child-murder; but now sinning ignorantly, (for
he had not heard of the oath), if he had been slain, he would have made
the anguish of his father double; for he would have had both to
sacrifice a son, and a son who had done no wrong. But now to proceed
with the rest of the history; “When he had eaten,” it is said, “His eyes
saw clearly.” <span id="fr_1588"></span>[1589](#fn_1588.md) And here it
condemns the king of great folly; shewing that hunger had almost blinded
the whole army, and diffused much darkness over their eyes. Afterwards
some one of the soldiers, perceiving the action, saith, “Thy father
sware an oath upon all the people, saying, cursed be the man who eateth
any food to-day. And the people were faint. And Jonathan said, My father
hath made away <span id="fr_1589"></span>[1590](#fn_1589.md) with the
land.” <span id="fr_1590"></span>[1591](#fn_1590.md) What does he mean by
the word, “made away with?” Why, that he had ruined, or destroyed them
all. Hence, when the oath was transgressed, all kept silence, and no one
dared to bring forth the criminal; and this became afterwards no small
matter of blame, for not only are those who break an oath, but those
also who are privy to it and conceal it, partakers of the crime.

<span id="xix.xvi-p29"></span>9. But let us see what follows; “And Saul
said, Let us go down after the strangers, <span
id="fr_1591"></span>[1592](#fn_1591.md) and spoil them. And the priest
said, Let us <span id="page_435">p. 435</span> <span
id="xix.xvi-Page_435"></span>draw near hither unto God.” <span
id="fr_1592"></span>[1593](#fn_1592.md) For in old times God led forth the
people to battle; and without His consent no one dared to engage in the
fight, and war was with them a matter of religion. For not from weakness
of body, but from their sins they were conquered, whenever they were
conquered; and not by might and courage, but by favour from above they
prevailed, whenever they did prevail. Victory and defeat were also to
them a means of training, and a school of virtue. And not to them only,
but to their adversaries; for this was made evident to them too, that
the fate of battle with the Jews was decided not by the nature of their
arms, but by the life and good works of the warriors. The Midianites at
least perceiving this, and knowing that people to be invincible, and
that to have attacked them with arms and engines of war would have been
fruitless, and that it was only possible to conquer them by sin, having
decked out handsome virgins, and set them in the array, <span
id="fr_1593"></span>[1594](#fn_1593.md) excited the soldiers to
lasciviousness, endeavouring by means of fornication to deprive them of
God’s assistance; which accordingly happened. For when they had fallen
into sin, they became an easy prey to all; and those whom weapons, and
horses, and soldiers, and so many engines availed not to capture, <span
id="fr_1594"></span>[1595](#fn_1594.md) sin by its nature delivered over
bound to their enemies. Shields, and spears, and darts were all alike
found useless; but beauty of visage and wantonness of soul overpowered
these brave men.

<span id="xix.xvi-p34"></span>10. Therefore one gives this admonition;
“Observe not the beauty of a strange woman, and meet not a woman
addicted to fornication. <span id="fr_1595"></span>[1596](#fn_1595.md) For
honey distils from the lips of an harlot, which at the time may seem
smooth to thy throat, but afterward thou wilt find it more bitter than
gall, and sharper than a two-edged sword.” <span
id="fr_1596"></span>[1597](#fn_1596.md) For the harlot knows not how to
love, but only to ensnare; her kiss hath poison, and her mouth a
pernicious drug. And if this does not immediately appear, it is the more
necessary to avoid her on that account, because she veils that
destruction, and keeps that death concealed, and suffers it not to
become manifest at the first. So that if any one pursues pleasure, and a
life full of gladness, let him avoid the society of fornicating women,
for they fill the minds of their lovers with a thousand conflicts and
tumults, setting in motion against them continual strifes and
contentions, by means of their words, and all their actions. And just as
it is with those who are the most virulent enemies, so the object of
their actions and schemes is to plunge their lovers into shame and
poverty, and the worst extremities. And in the same manner as hunters,
when they have spread out their nets, endeavour to drive thither the
wild animals, in order that they may put them to death, so also is it
with these women. When they have spread out on every side the
wings <span id="fr_1597"></span>[1598](#fn_1597.md) of lasciviousness by
means of the eyes, and dress, and language, they afterwards drive in
their lovers, and bind them; nor do they give over until they have drunk
up their blood, insulting them at last, and mocking their folly, and
pouring over them a flood of ridicule. And indeed such a man is no
longer worthy of compassion but deserves to be derided and jeered, since
he is found more irrational than a woman, and a harlot besides.
Therefore the Wise Man gives this word of exhortation again, “Drink
waters from thine own cistern, and from the fountain of thine own
well.” <span id="fr_1598"></span>[1599](#fn_1598.md) And again; “Let the
hind of thy friendship, and the foal of thy favours, consort with
thee.” <span id="fr_1599"></span>[1600](#fn_1599.md) These things he speaks
of a wife associated with her husband by the law of marriage. Why
leavest thou her who is a helpmate, to run to one who is a plotter
against thee? Why dost thou turn away from her who is the partner of thy
living, and court her who would subvert thy life? The one is thy member
and body, the other is a sharp sword. Therefore, beloved, flee
fornication; both for its present evils, and for its future punishment.

<span id="xix.xvi-p40"></span>11. Perchance we may seem to have fallen
aside from the subject; but to say thus much, is no departure from it.
For we do not wish to read you histories merely for their own sake, but
that you may correct each of the passions which trouble you: therefore
also we make these frequent appeals, <span
id="fr_1600"></span>[1601](#fn_1600.md) preparing our discourse for you in
all varieties of style; since it is probable that in so large an
assembly, there is a great variety of distempers; and our task is to
cure not one only, but many different wounds; and therefore it is
necessary that the medicine of instruction should be various. Let us
however return thither from whence we made this digression: “And the
Priest said, Let us draw near unto God. And Saul asked counsel of God.
<span id="page_436">p. 436</span> <span
id="xix.xvi-Page_436"></span>Shall I go down after the strangers? Wilt
Thou deliver them into my hands? But on that day the Lord answered him
not.” <span id="fr_1601"></span>[1602](#fn_1601.md) Observe the benignity
and mildness of God who loveth man. For He did not launch a thunderbolt,
nor shake the earth; but what friends do to friends, when treated
contemptuously, this the Lord did towards the servant. He only received
him silently, speaking by His silence, and by it giving utterance to all
His wrath. This Saul understood, and said, as it is recorded, “Bring
near hither all the tribes of the people, and know and see in whom this
sin hath been this day. For as the Lord liveth, Who hath saved Israel,
though the answer be against Jonathan my son, he shall surely
die.” <span id="fr_1602"></span>[1603](#fn_1602.md) Seest thou his
rashness? Perceiving that his first oath had been transgressed, he does
not even then learn self-control, but adds again a second. Consider also
the malignity of the devil. For since he was aware that frequently the
son when discovered, and publicly arraigned, is able by the very sight
at once to make the father relent, and might soften the king’s wrath, he
anticipated his sentence by the obligation of a second oath; holding him
by a kind of double bond, and not permitting him to be the master of his
own determination, but forcing him on every side to that iniquitous
murder. And even whilst the offender was not yet produced, he hath
passed judgment, and whilst ignorant of the criminal, he gave sentence.
The father became the executioner; and before the enquiry declared his
verdict of condemnation! What could be more irrational than this
proceeding?

<span id="xix.xvi-p44"></span>12. Saul then having made this
declaration, the people were more afraid than before, and all were in a
state of great trembling and terror. But the devil rejoiced, at having
rendered them all thus anxious. There was no one, we are told, of all
the people, who answered. “And Saul said, Ye will be in bondage, and I,
and Jonathan my son, will be in bondage.” <span
id="fr_1603"></span>[1604](#fn_1603.md) But what he means is to this
effect; “You are aiming at nothing else, than to deliver yourselves to
your enemies, and to become slaves instead of free men; whilst you
provoke God against you, in not delivering up the guilty person.”
Observe also another contradiction produced by the oath. It had been
fitting, if he wished to find the author of this guilt, to have made no
such threat, nor to have bound himself to vengeance by an oath; that
becoming less afraid, they might more readily bring the offender to
light. <span id="fr_1604"></span>[1605](#fn_1604.md) But under the
influence of anger, and great madness, and his former unreasonableness,
he again does that which is directly contrary to what he desires. What
need is there to enlarge? He commits the matter to a decision by lot;
and the lot falleth upon Saul, and Jonathan; “And Saul said, Cast ye the
lot between me and Jonathan; and they cast the lot, and Jonathan was
taken. And Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me, what hast thou done? And
Jonathan told him, saying, I only tasted a little honey on the top of
the rod which is in my hand, and, lo! I must die.” <span
id="fr_1605"></span>[1606](#fn_1605.md) Who is there that these words would
not have moved and turned to pity? Consider what a tempest Saul then
sustained, his bowels being torn with anguish, and the most profound
precipice appearing on either hand! But nevertheless he did not learn
self-control, for what does he say? “God do so to me, and more also; for
thou shalt surely die this day.” <span
id="fr_1606"></span>[1607](#fn_1606.md) Behold again the third oath, and
not simply the third, but one with a very narrow limit as to time; for
he does not merely say, “Thou shalt die;” but, “this day.” <span
id="fr_1607"></span>[1608](#fn_1607.md) For the devil was hurrying,
hurrying him on, constraining him and driving him to this impious
murder. Wherefore he did not suffer him to assign any future day for the
sentence, lest there should be any correction of the evil by delay. And
the people said to Saul, “God do so to us, and more also, if he shall be
put to death, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel. As the
Lord liveth, there shall not an hair of his head fall to the ground;
because he hath wrought a merciful thing from God to-day.” <span
id="fr_1608"></span>[1609](#fn_1608.md) Behold how, in the second place,
the people also swore, and swore contrary to the king.

<span id="xix.xvi-p51"></span>13. Now recollect, I pray, the cord pulled
by the children, and breaking, and throwing on their backs those who
pull it. Saul swore not once or twice, but several times. The people
swore what was contrary, and strained in the opposite direction. Of
necessity then it followed, that the oath must in any wise be broken
through. For it were impossible that all these should keep their oaths.
And now tell me not of the event of this transaction; but consider how
many evils were springing from it; and how the devil from thence was
preparing the tragedy and usurpation of Absalom. For if the king had
chosen to resist, and to proceed to the execution of his oath, the
people would have been <span id="page_437">p. 437</span> <span
id="xix.xvi-Page_437"></span>in array against him; and a grievous
rebellion <span id="fr_1609"></span>[1610](#fn_1609.md) would have been set
on foot. And again, if the son consulting his own safety had chosen to
throw himself into the hands of the army, he would straightway have
become a parricide. Seest thou not, that rebellion, as well as
child-murder, and parricide, and battle, and civil war, and slaughter,
and blood, and dead bodies without number, are the consequences of one
oath. For if war had perchance broken out, Saul might have been slain,
and Jonathan perchance too, and many of the soldiers would have been cut
to pieces; and after all the keeping of the oath would not have been
forwarded. So that it is not for thee to consider that these events did
not occur, but to mark this point, that it was the nature of the case to
necessitate the occurrence of such things. However, the people
prevailed. Come then, let us reckon up the perjuries that were the
consequence. The oath of Saul was first broken by his son; and again a
second and a third, concerning the slaying of his son, by Saul himself.
And the people seemed to have kept their oath. Yet if any one closely
examines the matter, they too all became liable to the charge of
perjury. For they compelled the father of Jonathan to perjure himself,
by not surrendering the son to the father. Seest thou how many persons
one oath made obnoxious to perjury, <span
id="fr_1610"></span>[1611](#fn_1610.md) willingly and unwillingly; how many
evils it wrought, how many deaths it caused?

<span id="xix.xvi-p54"></span>14. Now in the commencement of this
discourse I promised to shew that perjury would in any case result from
opposite oaths; but truly the course of the history has proved more than
I was establishing. It has exhibited not one, two, or three individuals,
but a whole people, and not one, two, or three oaths, but many more
transgressed. I might also make mention of another instance, and shew
from that, how one oath caused a still greater and more grievous
calamity. For one oath <span id="fr_1611"></span>[1612](#fn_1611.md)
entailed upon all the Jews the capture of their cities, as well as of
their wives and children; the ravages of fire, the invasion of
barbarians, the pollution of sacred things, and ten thousand other evils
yet more distressing. But I perceive that the discourse is running to a
great length. Therefore, dismissing here the narration of this history,
I beseech you, together with the beheading of John, to tell one another
also of the murder of Jonathan, and the general destruction of a whole
people (which did not indeed take place, but which was involved in the
obligation of the oaths); and both at home, and in public, and with your
wives, and friends, and with neighbours, and with all men in general, to
make an earnest business of this matter, and not to think it a
sufficient apology that we can plead custom.

<span id="xix.xvi-p56"></span>15. For that this excuse is a mere
pretext, and that the fault arises not from custom but from
listlessness, I will endeavour to convince you from what has already
occurred. The Emperor has shut up the baths of the city, and has given
orders that no one shall bathe; and no one has dared to transgress the
law, nor to find fault with what has taken place, nor to allege custom.
But even though in weak health perchance, men and women, and children
and old men; and many women but recently eased from the pangs of
childbirth; though all requiring this as a necessary medicine; bear with
the injunction, willingly or unwillingly; and neither plead infirmity of
body, nor the tyranny of custom, nor that they are punished, whereas
others were the offenders, nor any other thing of this kind, but
contentedly put up with this punishment, because they were in
expectation of greater evils; and pray daily that the wrath of the
Emperor may go no further. Seest thou that where there is fear, the bond
of custom is easily relaxed, although it be of exceedingly long
standing, and great necessity? To be denied the use of the bath is
certainly a grievous matter. For although we be never so philosophic,
the nature of the body proves incapable of deriving any benefit for its
own health, from the philosophy of the soul. But as to abstinence from
swearing, this is exceedingly easy, and brings no injury at all; none to
the body, none to the mind; but, on the contrary, great gain, much
safety, and abundant wealth. How then is it any thing but absurd, to
submit to the greatest hardships, when an Emperor enjoins it; but when
God commands nothing grievous nor difficult, but what is very tolerable
and easy, to despise or to deride it, and to advance custom as an
excuse? Let us not, I entreat, so far despise our own safety, but let us
fear God as we fear man. I know that ye shudder at hearing this, but
what deserves to be shuddered at is that ye do not pay even so much
respect to God; and that whilst ye diligently observe the Emperor’s
decrees, ye trample under foot those which are divine, and which have
come down from heaven; and consider diligence concerning these a
secondary object. For what apology will <span id="page_438">p.
438</span> <span id="xix.xvi-Page_438"></span>there be left for us, and
what pardon, if after so much admonition we persist in the same
practices. For I began this admonition at the very commencement of the
calamity which has taken hold of the city, and that is now on the point
of coming to an end; but we have not as yet thoroughly put in practice
even one precept. How then can we ask a removal of the evils which still
beset us, when we have not been able to perform a single precept? How
can we expect a change for the better? How shall we pray? With what
tongue shall we call upon God? For if we perform the law, we shall enjoy
much pleasure, when the Emperor is reconciled to the city. But if we
remain in the transgression, shame and reproach will be ours on every
hand, inasmuch as when God hath freed us from the danger we have
continued in the same listlessness.

<span id="xix.xvi-p57"></span>16. Oh! that it were possible for me to
undress the souls of those who swear frequently, and to expose to view
the wounds and the bruises which they receive daily from oaths! We
should then need neither admonition nor counsel; for the sight of these
wounds would avail more powerfully than all that could be said, to
withdraw from their wickedness even those who are most addicted to this
wicked practice. Nevertheless, if it be not possible to spread before
the eyes the shameful state of their soul, it may be possible to expose
it to the thoughts, and to display it in its rottenness and corruption.
For as it saith, “As a servant that is continually beaten will not be
clear of a bruise, so he that sweareth and nameth God continually will
not be purified of his sin.” <span id="fr_1612"></span>[1613](#fn_1612.md)
It is impossible, utterly impossible, that the mouth which is practised
in swearing, should not frequently commit perjury. Therefore, I beseech
you all, by laying aside this dreadful and wicked habit, to win another
crown. And since it is every where sung of our city, that first of all
the cities of the world, she bound on her brow <span
id="fr_1613"></span>[1614](#fn_1613.md) the name of Christians, so let all
have to say, that Antioch alone, of all the cities throughout the world,
hath expelled all oaths from her own borders. Yea, rather, should this
be done, she will not be herself crowned alone, but will also carry
others along with her to the same pitch of zeal. And as the name of
Christians having had its origin here, hath as it were from a kind of
fountain overflown all the world, even so this good work, having taken
its root and starting-point from hence, will make all men that inhabit
the earth your disciples; so that a double and treble reward may arise
to you, at once on account of your own good works, and of the
instruction afforded to others. This will be to you the brightest of
diadems! This will make your city a mother city, not on earth, but in
the heavens! This will stand by us at That Day, and bring us the crown
of righteousness; which God grant that we may all obtain, through the
grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, with Whom to the
Father, together with the Holy Spirit, be glory, now and ever, and world
without end. Amen.
