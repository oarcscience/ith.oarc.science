<span id="iii.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="iii.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII</span><span class="c1"><span
id="iii.xii-p1.2"></span>.—*The Writings of Chrysostom.*</span>

<span id="iii.xii-p2"></span>Chrysostom was the most fruitful author
among the Greek Fathers. Suidas makes the extravagant remark that only
the omniscient God could recount all his writings. The best have been
preserved and have already been noticed in chronological order. They may
be divided into five classes: (1) Moral and ascetic treatises, including
the work on the Priesthood; (2) About six hundred Homilies and
Commentaries; (3) Occasional, festal and panegyrical orations; (4)
Letters; (5) Liturgy.

<span id="iii.xii-p3"></span>His most important and permanently useful
works are his Homilies and Commentaries, which fill eleven of the
thirteen folio volumes of the Benedictine edition. They go together; his
homilies are expository, and his commentaries are homiletical and
practical. Continuous expositions, according to chapter and verse, he
wrote only on the first eight chapters of Isaiah, and on the Epistle to
the Galatians. All others are arranged in sermons with a moral
application at the close. Suidas and Cassiodorus state that he wrote
commentaries on the whole Bible. We have from him Homilies on Genesis,
the Psalms, the Gospel of Matthew, the Gospel of John, the Acts, the
Pauline Epistles including the Hebrews, which he considered Pauline.
Besides, he delivered discourses on separate texts of Scripture, on
church festivals, eulogies on apostles and martyrs, sermons against the
Pagans, against the Jews and Judaizing Christians, against the Arians,
and the famous twenty-one orations on the Statues.

<span id="iii.xii-p4"></span>He published some of his sermons himself,
but most of them were taken down by short-<span id="page_18">p.
18</span> <span id="iii.xii-Page_18"></span>hand writers. <span
id="fr_23"></span>[24](#fn_23) Written sermons were the exceptions in
those days. The preacher usually was seated, the people were standing.

<span id="iii.xii-p6"></span>Of the letters of Chrysostom we have
already spoken.

<span id="iii.xii-p7"></span>The Liturgy of Chrysostom so-called is an
abridgment and improvement of the Liturgy of St. Basil (d. 379), and
both are descended from the Liturgy of James, which they superseded.
They have undergone gradual changes. It is impossible to determine the
original text, as no two copies precisely agree. Chrysostom frequently
refers to different parts of the divine service customary in his day,
but there is no evidence that he composed a liturgy, nor is it
probable. <span id="fr_24"></span>[25](#fn_24) The Liturgy which bears
his name is still used in the orthodox Greek and Russian church on all
Sundays, except those during Lent, and on the eve of Epiphany, Easter
and Christmas, when the Liturgy of Basil takes its place.

in the Septuagint ([Ps. xlv. 2](../../../bib/sep/psa045.htm#002)<span

verb ὀξυγραφ™ω, *to write fast*, and the noun ὀξυγραφία, *the art of
writing fast*.
