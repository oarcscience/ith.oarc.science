id="xix.xii-p1.1"></span>Homily X.</span>

<span id="xix.xii-p2"></span>Commendation of those who came to hear
after taking a meal.—Observations on the physiology of the natural
world; and against those who deify the creation; and on the duty of not
swearing.

<span id="xix.xii-p3"></span>1. I <span class="c12"><span
id="xix.xii-p3.1"></span>joy,</span> and rejoice with you all, that ye
have actually put in practice that admonition of ours, which we lately
made with respect to those who were absent, for the reason that they
were not fasting. For I think that many of those who have dined <span
id="fr_1433"></span>[1434](#fn_1433.md) are to-day present; and go to fill
up this goodly assemblage; and that this is the fact, I conjecture from
the more brilliant spectacle that I see around me, and the greater
concourse of hearers. Not in vain, it seems, did I lately <span
id="fr_1434"></span>[1435](#fn_1434.md) spend so many words on their
account, appealing to your Charity, to draw them to their Mother; <span
id="fr_1435"></span>[1436](#fn_1435.md) and to persuade them that it is
lawful, even after bodily nourishment, to partake also of that which is
spiritual. And in which case, beloved, I ask, did ye act for the better;
at the time of the last assembly when after your meal ye turned to your
slumbers; or now, when after the meal ye have presented yourselves at
the hearing of the divine laws? Was it best when ye loitered about in
the forum, and took part in meetings which were no wise profitable; or
now, when ye stand with your own brethren, and hear the prophetic
oracles? It is no disgrace, beloved, to have eaten, but after eating to
remain at home, and so to be deprived of this sacred banquet. For whilst
thou remainest at home, thou wilt be more slothful and supine; but
coming here thou wilt shake off all slumber and listlessness; and laying
aside not only listlessness, <span id="fr_1436"></span>[1437](#fn_1436.md)
but also all sadness, thou wilt be more at ease, and in better heart in
all the events that may happen.

<span id="xix.xii-p8"></span>2. What need then is there to say more?
Stand only nigh the man who fasts, and thou wilt straightway partake of
his good odour; for fasting is a spiritual perfume; and through the
eyes, the tongue, and every part, it manifests the good disposition of
the soul. I have said this, not for the purpose of condemning those who
have dined, but that I may shew the advantage of fasting. I do not,
however, call mere abstinence from meats, fasting; but even before this,
abstinence from sin; since he who, after he has taken a meal, has come
hither with suitable sobriety, is not very far behind the man who fasts;
even as he who continues fasting, if he does not give earnest and
diligent heed to what is spoken, will derive no great benefit from his
fast. He who eats, and yet takes a part in the sacred assembly with
suitable earnestness, is in much better case than he who eats not at
all, and remains absent. This abstinence will by no means be able to
benefit us as much as the participation in spiritual instruction
conveyeth to us benefit and advantage. Where indeed, besides, wilt thou
hear the things upon which thou meditatest here? Wert thou to go to the
bench of justice? quarrels and contentions are there! or into the
council-chamber? there is anxious thought about political matters! or to
thine home? solicitude on the subject of thy private affairs afflicts
thee in every direction! or wert thou to go to the conferences and
debates of the forum? every thing there is earthly and corruptible! For
all the words that pass among those assembled there, are concerning
merchandize, or taxes, or the sumptuous table, or the sale of lands, or
other contracts, or wills, or inheritances, or some other things of that
kind. And shouldest thou enter even into the royal halls, there again
thou wouldest hear in the same way all discoursing of wealth, or power,
or of the glory which is held in honour here, but of nothing that is
spiritual. But here on the contrary everything relates to heaven, and
heavenly things; to our soul, to our life, the purpose for which we were
born, and why we spend an allotted time upon earth, and on what terms we
migrate from hence, and into what condition we shall enter after these
things, and why our body is of clay, what also is the nature of death,
what, in short, the present life is, and what the future. The discourses
that are here made by us contain nothing at all of an earthly kind, but
are all in reference to spiritual things. Thus, then, it is that we
shall have made great provision for our salvation, and shall depart
hence with a good hope.

<span id="xix.xii-p9"></span>3. Since, therefore, we did not scatter the
seed in vain, but ye hunted out all who were <span id="page_407">p.
407</span> <span id="xix.xii-Page_407"></span>absent, as I exhorted you;
suffer us now to return you a recompense; and having reminded you of a
few things that were said before, to repay you again what remains. What
then were those matters that were before treated of? We were enquiring
how, and in what manner, before the giving of the Scriptures, God
ordered His dispensation toward us; and we said, that by means of the
creation He instructed our race, stretching out the heavens, and there
openly unfolding a vast volume, useful alike to the simple and the wise,
to the poor and to the rich, to Scythians and to barbarians, and to all
in general who dwell upon the earth; a volume which is much larger than
the multitude of those instructed by it. We discoursed also at length
concerning the night, and the day, and the order of these, as well as of
the harmony which is strictly preserved by them; and much was said
respecting the measured dance of the seasons of the year, and of their
equality. For just as the day defraudeth not the night even of half an
hour throughout the whole year, so also do these distribute all the days
among themselves equally. But, as I said before, not only does the
greatness and beauty of the creation shew forth the Divine Architect,
but the very manner likewise in which it is compacted together, and the
method of operation, transcending as it does, the ordinary course of
nature. For it would have been in accordance with nature for water to be
borne upon the earth; but now we see, on the contrary, that the earth is
supported by the waters. It would have been in accordance with nature
that fire should tend upwards; but now on the contrary we see the beams
of the sun directed towards the earth; and the waters to be above the
heavens, yet not falling away; <span
id="fr_1437"></span>[1438](#fn_1437.md) and the sun running below them, yet
not quenched by the waters, nor dispelling their moisture. Besides these
things we said that this whole universe consists of four elements, these
being adverse to and at strife with one another; yet one does not
consume the other, although they are mutually destructive. Whence it is
evident that some invisible power bridles them, and the will of God
becomes their bond.

<span id="xix.xii-p11"></span>4. To-day, I wish to dwell a little more
on this subject. Arouse yourselves, however, and give earnest heed unto
us! And that the wonder may appear more clearly, I will draw the lesson
concerning these things from our own bodies. This body of ours, so
short, and small, consists of four elements; viz. of what is warm, that
is, of blood; of what is dry, that is, of yellow bile; of what is moist,
that is, of phlegm; of what is cold, that is, of black bile. And let no
one think this subject foreign to that which we have in hand. “For He
that is spiritual judgeth all things; yet He Himself is judged of no
man.” <span id="fr_1438"></span>[1439](#fn_1438.md) Thus also Paul touched
upon principles of agriculture, whilst discoursing to us of the
Resurrection; and said, “Thou fool; that which thou sowest is not
quickened, except it die.” <span id="fr_1439"></span>[1440](#fn_1439.md)
But if that blessed man brought forward questions of agriculture,
neither should any one blame us if we handle matters pertaining to
medical science. For our discourse is now respecting the Creation of
God; and this ground-work of ideas will be necessary for our purpose.
As, therefore, I said before, this body of ours consists of four
elements; and if either revolts against the whole, death is the result
of this revolt. As for instance, by a superabundance “of bile” fever is
produced; and should this proceed beyond a certain measure, it effects a
rapid dissolution. Again, when there is an excess of the cold element,
paralyses, agues, apoplexies, and an infinite number of other maladies
are generated. And every form of disease is the effect of an excess of
these elements; when either of them overpassing its own bounds, acts the
part of a tyrant against the rest, and mars the symmetry of the whole.
Interrogate then him who says, that all things are spontaneous and
self-produced. If this little and diminutive body, having the advantage
of medicines, and of medical skill, and of a soul within which regulates
it, and of much moral wisdom, as well as innumerable other helps, be not
always able to continue in a state of order, but often perishes, and is
destroyed, when some disturbance takes place within it; how could a
world like this, containing substances of such vast bulk and compounded
of those same elements, remain during so long a time without any
disturbance, unless it enjoyed the advantage of a manifold providence?
Neither would it be reasonable to suppose that this body, which has the
benefit of superintendence both without and within, should scarcely be
sufficient for its own preservation; and that a world such as this is,
enjoying no such superintendence, should during so many years suffer
nothing of that sort which our body suffers. For how, I ask, is it that
not one of these elements hath gone beyond its own boundaries, nor
swallowed up all the rest? Who hath brought them together from the
beginning? Who hath bound? Who hath bridled? Who <span id="page_408">p.
408</span> <span id="xix.xii-Page_408"></span>hath held them together
during so long a period? For if the body of the world were simple and
uniform, what I speak of would not have been so impossible. But when
there hath been such a strife between the elements, even from the
beginning; who so senseless as to think that these things would have
come together, and remained together when united, without One to effect
this conjunction? For if we who are evil-affected towards one another
not by nature, but by will, cannot come spontaneously to an agreement as
long as we remain at variance, and hold ourselves ungraciously towards
one another; if we have yet need of some one else to bring us into a
state of conjunction; and after this conjunction further to clench us,
and persuade us to abide by our reconciliation, and not again to be at
variance; how could the elements, which neither partake of sense nor
reason, and which are naturally adverse, and inimical to each other,
have come together, and agreed and remained with one another, if there
were not some ineffable Power which effected this conjunction; and after
this conjunction, always restrained them by the same bond?

<span id="xix.xii-p14"></span>5. Dost thou not perceive how this body
wastes away, withers, and perishes after the secession of the soul, and
each of the elements thereof returns to its own appointed place? <span
id="fr_1440"></span>[1441](#fn_1440.md) This very same thing, indeed, would
also happen to the world, if the Power which always governs it had left
it devoid of Its own providence. For if a ship does not hold together
without a pilot, but soon founders, how could the world have held
together so long a time if there was no one governing its course? And
that I may not enlarge, suppose the world to be a ship; the earth to be
placed below as the keel; the sky to be the sail; men to be the
passengers; <span id="fr_1441"></span>[1442](#fn_1441.md) the subjacent
abyss, the sea. How is it then that during so long a time, no shipwreck
has taken place? Now let a ship go one day without a pilot and
crew, <span id="fr_1442"></span>[1443](#fn_1442.md) and thou wilt see it
straightway foundering! But the world, though subsisting now five
thousand years, and many more, hath suffered nothing of the kind. But
why do I talk of a ship? Suppose one hath pitched a small hut in the
vineyards; and when the fruit is gathered, leaves it vacant; it stands,
however, scarce two or three days, but soon goes to pieces, and tumbles
down! Could not a hut, forsooth, stand without superintendence? How then
could the workmanship of a world, so fair and marvellous; the laws of
the night and day; the interchanging dances of the seasons; the course
of nature chequered and varied as it is in every way throughout the
earth, the sea, the sky; in plants, and in animals that fly, swim, walk,
creep; and in the race of men, far more dignified than any of these,
continue yet unbroken, during so long a period, without some kind of
providence? But in addition to what has been said, follow me whilst I
enumerate the meadows, the gardens, the various tribes of flowers; all
sorts of herbs, and their uses; <span
id="fr_1443"></span>[1444](#fn_1443.md) their odours, forms, disposition,
yea, but their very names; the trees which are fruitful, and which are
barren; the nature of metals,—and of animals,—in the sea, or on the
land; of those that swim, and those that traverse the air; the
mountains, the forests, the groves; the meadow below, and the meadow
above; for there is a meadow on the earth, and a meadow too in the sky;
the various flowers of the stars; the rose below, and the rainbow above!
Would you have me point out also the meadow of birds? Consider the
variegated body of the peacock, surpassing every dye, and the fowls of
purple plumage. <span id="fr_1444"></span>[1445](#fn_1444.md) Contemplate
with me the beauty of the sky; how it has been preserved so long without
being dimmed; and remains as bright and clear as if it had been only
fabricated to-day; moreover, the power of the earth, how its womb has
not become effete by bringing forth during so long a time! Contemplate
with me the fountains; how they burst forth and fail not, since the time
they were begotten, to flow forth continually throughout the day and
night! Contemplate with me the sea, receiving so many rivers, yet never
exceeding its measure! But how long shall we pursue things unattainable!
It is fit, indeed, that over every one of these which has been spoken
of, we should say, “O Lord, how hast Thou magnified Thy works; in wisdom
hast Thou made them all.” <span id="fr_1445"></span>[1446](#fn_1445.md)

<span id="xix.xii-p21"></span>6. But what is the sapient argument of the
unbelievers, when we go over all these particulars with them; the
magnitude, the beauty of the creation, the prodigality, the munificence
everywhere displayed? This very thing, say they, is the worst fault,
that God hath made the world so beautiful and so vast. For if He had not
made it beautiful and vast, we should not have made a god of it; but now
being struck with its grandeur, and <span id="page_409">p. 409</span>
<span id="xix.xii-Page_409"></span>marvelling at its beauty, we have
thought it to be a deity. <span id="fr_1446"></span>[1447](#fn_1446.md) But
such an argument is good for nothing. For that neither the magnitude,
nor beauty of the world is the cause of this impiety, but their own want
of understanding, is what we are prepared to show, proved by the case of
ourselves, who have never been so affected. Why then have “we” not made
a deity of it? Do we not see it with the same eyes as themselves? Do we
not enjoy the same advantage from the creation with themselves? Do we
not possess the same soul? Have we not the same body? Do we not tread
the same earth? How comes it that this beauty and magnitude hath not
persuaded us to think the same as they do? But this will be evident not
from this proof only, but from another besides. For as a proof that it
is not for its beauty they have made a deity of it, but by reason of
their own folly, why do they adore the ape, the crocodile, the dog, and
the vilest of animals? Truly, “they became vain in their imaginations,
and their foolish heart was darkened. Professing themselves to be wise,
they became fools.” <span id="fr_1447"></span>[1448](#fn_1447.md)

<span id="xix.xii-p24"></span>7. Nevertheless, we will not frame our
answer from these things only, but will also say something yet further.
For God, foreseeing these things of old, destroyed, in His wisdom, this
plea of theirs. On this account He made the world not only wonderful and
vast, but also corruptible and perishable; and placed therein many
evidences of its weakness; and what He did with respect to the
Apostles, <span id="fr_1448"></span>[1449](#fn_1448.md) He did with respect
to the whole world. What then did He with respect to the Apostles? Since
they used to perform many great and astonishing signs and wonders, He
suffered them constantly to be scourged, to be expelled, to inhabit the
dungeon, to encounter bodily infirmities, to be in continual
tribulations, lest the greatness of their miracles should make them to
be accounted as gods amongst mankind. Therefore when He had bestowed so
great favour upon them, He suffered their bodies to be mortal, and in
many cases obnoxious to disease; and did not remove their infirmity,
that He might give full proof of their nature. And this is not merely my
assertion, but that of Paul himself, who says, “For though I would
desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; but now I forbear, lest any man
should think of me above that which he seeth me to be, or that he
heareth of me.” <span id="fr_1449"></span>[1450](#fn_1449.md) And again,
“But we have this treasure in earthen vessels.” <span
id="fr_1450"></span>[1451](#fn_1450.md) But what is meant by “earthen
vessels?” In this body, he means, which is mortal and perishable. For
just as the earthen vessel is formed from clay and fire, so also the
body of these saints being clay, and receiving the energy of the
spiritual fire, becomes an earthen vessel. But for what reason was it
thus constituted, and so great a treasure, and such a plentitude of
graces entrusted to a mortal and corruptible body? “That the excellency
of the power may be of God, and not of us.” For when thou seest the
Apostles raising the dead, yet themselves sick, and unable to remove
their own infirmities, thou mayest clearly perceive, that the
resurrection of the dead man was not effected by the power of him who
raised him, but by the energy of the Spirit. For in proof, that they
were frequently sick, hear what Paul saith respecting Timothy, “Use a
little wine for thy stomach’s sake, and thine often infirmities.” <span
id="fr_1451"></span>[1452](#fn_1451.md) And again, of another he saith,
“But Trophimus I have left at Miletus sick.” <span
id="fr_1452"></span>[1453](#fn_1452.md) And writing to the Philippians, he
said, “Epaphroditus was sick nigh unto death.” <span
id="fr_1453"></span>[1454](#fn_1453.md) For if, when this was the case,
they accounted them to be gods, and prepared to do sacrifice unto them,
saying, “The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men;” <span
id="fr_1454"></span>[1455](#fn_1454.md) had such infirmities not existed,
to what extent of impiety might not men have proceeded, when they beheld
their miracles? As then in this case, because of the greatness of these
signs, He suffered their nature to remain in a state of infirmity, and
permitted those repeated trials, in order that they might not be thought
to be gods, thus likewise He did with respect to the creation, a thing
nearly parallel to this. For He fashioned it beautiful and vast; but on
the other hand corruptible.

<span id="xix.xii-p32"></span>8. And both of these points the Scriptures
teach, for one in treating of the beauty of the heavens thus speaks;
“The heavens declare the glory of God.” <span
id="fr_1455"></span>[1456](#fn_1455.md) And again, “Who hath placed the sky
as a vault, <span id="fr_1456"></span>[1457](#fn_1456.md) and spread it out
as a tent over the earth.” <span id="fr_1457"></span>[1458](#fn_1457.md)
And again, “Who holdeth the circle of heaven.” <span
id="fr_1458"></span>[1459](#fn_1458.md) But another writer, shewing that
although the world be great and fair, it is yet corruptible, thus
speaks; “Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the
earth, and the <span id="page_410">p. 410</span> <span
id="xix.xii-Page_410"></span>heavens are the works of Thine hands. They
shall perish, but Thou remainest, and they all shall wax old as doth a
garment, and as a vesture shalt Thou fold them up, and they shall be
changed.” <span id="fr_1459"></span>[1460](#fn_1459.md) And again, David
saith of the sun, that “he is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber,
and rejoiceth as a giant to run his course.” <span
id="fr_1460"></span>[1461](#fn_1460.md) Seest thou how he places before
thee the beauty of this star, and its greatness? For even as a
bridegroom when he appears from some stately chamber, <span
id="fr_1461"></span>[1462](#fn_1461.md) so the sun sends forth his rays
under the East; and adorning the heaven as it were with a
saffron-coloured veil, and making the clouds like roses, and running
unimpeded all the day; he meets no obstacle to interrupt his course.
Beholdest thou, then, his beauty? Beholdest thou his greatness? Look
also at the proof of his weakness! For a certain wise man, to make this
plain, said, “What is brighter than the sun, yet the light thereof
suffers eclipse.” <span id="fr_1462"></span>[1463](#fn_1462.md) Nor is it
only from this circumstance that his infirmity is to be perceived, but
also in the concourse of the clouds. Often, at least, when a cloud
passes underneath him, though emitting his beams, and endeavouring to
pierce through it, he has not strength to do so; the cloud being too
dense, and not suffering him to penetrate through it. “He nourishes the
seeds, however,” <span id="fr_1463"></span>[1464](#fn_1463.md) replies some
one—Yes—still he does not nourish them by himself, but requires the
assistance of the earth, and of the dew, and of the rains, and of the
winds, and the right distribution of the seasons. And unless all these
things concur, the sun’s aid is but superfluous. But this would not seem
to be like a deity, to stand in need of the assistance of others, for
that which he wishes to do; for it is a special attribute of God to want
nothing; He Himself at least did not in this manner bring forth the
seeds from the ground; He only commanded, and they all shot forth. And
again, that thou mayest learn that it is not the nature of the elements,
but His command which effects all things; He both brought into being
these very elements which before were not; and without the need of any
aid, He brought down the manna for the Jews. For it is said, “He gave
them bread from heaven.” <span id="fr_1464"></span>[1465](#fn_1464.md) But
why do I say, that in order to the perfection of fruits, the sun
requires the aid of other elements for their sustenance; when he himself
requires the assistance of many things for his sustenance, and would not
himself be sufficient for himself. For in order that he may proceed on
his way, he needs the heaven as a kind of pavement spread out underneath
him; and that he may shine, he needs the clearness and rarity of the
air; since if even this become unusually dense, he is not able to show
his light; and, on the other hand, he requires coolness and moisture,
lest his rays should be intolerable to all, and burn up everything.
When, therefore, other elements overrule him, and correct his weakness
(overrule as for example, clouds, and walls, and certain other bodies
that intercept his light:—or correct his excess, as the dews, and
fountains, and cool air), how can such a one be a Deity? For God must be
independent, and not stand in need of assistance, be the source of all
good things to all, and be hindered by nothing; even as Paul, as well as
the prophet Isaiah, saith of God; the latter <span
id="fr_1465"></span>[1466](#fn_1465.md) thus making Him speak in His own
Person, “I fill heaven and earth, saith the Lord.” <span
id="fr_1466"></span>[1467](#fn_1466.md) And again, “Am I a God nigh at
hand, and not a God afar off?” <span
id="fr_1467"></span>[1468](#fn_1467.md) And again, David says, “I have said
unto the Lord, Thou art my Lord, for Thou hast no need of my good
things.” <span id="fr_1468"></span>[1469](#fn_1468.md) But Paul,
demonstrating this independence of help, and shewing that both these
things especially belong to God; to stand in need of nothing, and of
Himself to supply all things to all; speaks on this wise, “God that made
the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, Himself needeth not any thing,
giving to all life and all things.” <span
id="fr_1469"></span>[1470](#fn_1469.md)

<span id="xix.xii-p48"></span>9. It would indeed be easy for us to take
a survey of the other elements, the heaven, the air, the earth, the sea,
and to shew the imbecility of these, and how each requires the
assistance of his neighbour, and without this assistance, is lost and
destroyed. For as it regards the earth, if the fountains fail it, and
the moisture infused from the sea and the rivers, it quickly perishes by
being parched. The remaining elements too stand in need of one another,
the air of the sun, as well as the sun of the air. But not to protract
this discourse; in what has been said, having given a sufficient supply
of reasons to start from for those who are willing to receive them, we
shall be content. For if the sun, which is the most surprising part of
the whole creation, hath been proved to be so feeble and needy, how much
more the other parts of the universe? What then I have advanced
(offering these things for the consideration of the studious), I will
myself again shew you in discourse from the Scriptures; and prove, <span
id="page_411">p. 411</span> <span id="xix.xii-Page_411"></span>that not
only the sun, but also the whole universe is thus corruptible. For since
the elements are mutually destructive, and when much cold intervenes, it
chastens the force of the sun’s rays; and on the other hand, the heat
prevailing, consumes the cold; and since the elements are both the
causes and subjects of contrary qualities, and dispositions, in one
another; it is very evident that these things offer a proof of great
corruptibility; and of the fact, that all these things which are
visible, are a corporeal substance.

<span id="xix.xii-p49"></span>10. But since this subject is too lofty
for our simplicity, permit me now to lead you to the sweet fountain of
the Scriptures, that we may refresh your ears. For we will not discourse
to you of the heaven and the earth separately, but will exhibit the
Apostle declaring this very thing to us concerning the whole creation,
in these plain terms, that the whole creation is now in bondage to
corruption; and why it is thus in bondage, and at what time it shall be
delivered from it, and unto what condition it shall be translated. For
after he had said, “The sufferings of this present time are not worthy
to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us;” he goes on
to add; “For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the
manifestation of the sons of God. For the creature was made subject to
vanity, not willingly, but by reason of Him who hath subjected the same
in hope.” <span id="fr_1470"></span>[1471](#fn_1470.md) But what he intends
is to this effect; “The creature,” he says, “was made corruptible;” for
this is implied in the expression, “being made subject to vanity.” For
it was made corruptible by the command of God. But God so commanded it
for the sake of our race; for since it was to nurture a corruptible man,
it was necessary itself should also be of the same character; for of
course corruptible bodies were not to dwell in an incorruptible
creation. But, nevertheless, he tells us, it will not remain so. “The
creature <span id="fr_1471"></span>[1472](#fn_1471.md) also itself shall be
delivered from the bondage of corruption;” and afterwards, for the
purpose of shewing when this event shall take place, and through whom,
he adds, “Into the glorious liberty of the sons of God.” For when we are
raised, his meaning is, and assume incorruptible bodies; then also this
body of the heaven, the earth, and the whole creation, shall be
incorruptible, and imperishable. When, therefore, thou beholdest the sun
arising, admire the Creator; when thou beholdest him hiding himself and
disappearing, learn the weakness of his nature, that thou mayest not
adore him as a Deity! For God hath not only implanted in the nature of
the elements this proof of their weakness, but hath also bidden His
servants, that were but men, command them; so that although thou
shouldest not know their servitude from their aspect, thou mayest learn,
from those who have commanded them, that they are all thy
fellow-servants. Therefore it was, that Joshua, the son of Nave, <span
id="fr_1472"></span>[1473](#fn_1472.md) said, “Let the sun stand still in
Gibeon, and the moon over against the valley of Ajalon.” And again the
prophet Isaiah made the sun to retrace his steps, under the reign of
Hezekiah; and Moses gave orders to the air, and the sea, the earth, and
the rocks. Elisha changed the nature of the waters; the Three Children
triumphed over the fire. Thou seest how God hath provided for us on
either hand; leading us by the beauty of the elements to the knowledge
of His divinity; and, by their feebleness, not permitting us to lapse
into the worship of them.

<span id="xix.xii-p53"></span>11. For the sake of all these things then,
let us glorify Him, our Guardian; not only by words, but also by deeds;
and let us shew forth an excellent conversation, not only in general,
but in particular with regard to abstinence from oaths. For not every
sin brings the same penalty; but those which are easiest to be amended,
bring upon us the greatest punishment: which indeed Solomon intimated,
when he said, “It is not wonderful if any one be taken stealing; for he
stealeth that he may satisfy his soul that is hungry; but the adulterer,
by the lack of understanding, destroyeth his own soul.” <span
id="fr_1473"></span>[1474](#fn_1473.md) But what he means is to this
effect. The thief is a grievous offender, but not so grievous a one as
the adulterer: for the former, though it be a sorry reason for his
conduct, yet at the same time has to plead the necessity arising from
indigence; but the latter, when no necessity compels him, by his mere
madness rushes into the gulph of iniquity. This also may be said with
regard to those who swear. For they have not any pretext to allege, but
merely their contempt.

<span id="xix.xii-p55"></span>12. I know, indeed, that I may seem to be
too tedious and burdensome; and that I may be thought to give annoyance
by continuing this admonition. But nevertheless, I do not desist, in
order that ye may even be shamed by my shamelessness to abstain from the
cus<span id="page_412">p. 412</span> <span
id="xix.xii-Page_412"></span>tom of oaths. For if that unmerciful and
cruel judge, paying respect to the importunity of the widow, changed his
custom, much more will ye do this; and especially when he who is
exhorting you, doth it not for himself, but for your salvation. Or
rather, indeed, I cannot deny that I do this for myself; for I consider
your benefit as my own success. But I could wish that you, even as I
labour, and weary myself for your safety, would in like manner make your
own souls a matter of anxiety to yourselves; and then assuredly this
work of reformation would be perfected. And what need is there to
multiply words? For if there were no hell, neither punishment for the
contumacious, nor reward for the obedient; and I had come to you, and
asked this in the way of a favour, would ye not have consented? would ye
not have granted my petition, when I asked so trifling a favour? But
when it is God who asks this favour, and for the sake of yourselves, who
are to grant it, and not for Himself, Who is to receive it; who is there
so ungracious, who is there so miserable and wretched, that he will not
grant this favour to God, when He asks it; and especially when he
himself who grants it, is in future to enjoy the benefit of it?
Considering these things then, repeat over to yourselves, when ye depart
hence, all that has been said; and correct in every way those who take
no heed to it; to the end that we may receive the recompense of other
men’s good actions, as well as our own, through the grace and
lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, by Whom, and with Whom be glory
to the Father, with the Holy Ghost, for ever and ever. Amen.
