<span id="xvii.iii-p2"></span>————————————

<span id="xvii.iii-p3"></span><span class="c34"><span
id="xvii.iii-p3.1"></span>to my lady.</span>

<span id="xvii.iii-p4"></span>The most reverend and divinely favored
deaconess Olympias, I John, Bishop, send greeting in the Lord.

<span id="xvii.iii-p5"></span>1. <span class="c12"><span
id="xvii.iii-p5.1"></span>Come</span> now let me relieve the wound of
thy despondency, and disperse the thoughts which gather this cloud of
care around thee. For what is it which upsets thy mind, and why art thou
sorrowful and dejected? Is it because of the fierce black storm which
has overtaken the Church, enveloping all things in darkness as of a
night without a moon, and is growing to a head every day, travailing to
bring forth disastrous shipwrecks, and increasing the ruin of the world?
I know all this as well as you; none shall gainsay it, and if you like I
will form an image of the things now taking place so as to present the
tragedy yet more distinctly to thee. We behold a sea upheaved from the
very lowest depths, some sailors floating dead upon the waves, others
engulfed by them, the planks of the ships breaking up, the sails torn to
tatters, the masts sprung, the oars dashed out of the sailors’ hands,
the pilots seated on the deck, clasping their knees with their hands
instead of grasping the rudder, bewailing the hopelessness of their
situation with sharp cries and bitter lamentations, neither sky nor sea
clearly visible, but all one deep and impenetrable darkness, so that no
one can see his neighbour, whilst mighty is the roaring of the billows,
and monsters of the sea attack the crews on every side.

<span id="xvii.iii-p6"></span>But how much further shall I pursue the
unattainable? for whatever image of our present evils I may seek speech
shrinks baffled from the attempt. Nevertheless even when I look at these
calamities I do not abandon the hope of better things, considering as I
do who the pilot is in all this—not one who gets the better of the storm
by his art, but calms the raging waters by his rod. But if He does not
effect this at the outset and speedily, such is His custom—He does not
at the beginning put down these terrible evils, but when they have
increased, and come to extremities, and most persons are reduced to
despair, then He works wondrously, and beyond all expectation, thus
manifesting his own power, and training the patience of those who
undergo these calamities. Do not therefore be cast down. For there is
only one thing, Olympias, which is really terrible, only one real trial,
and that is sin; and I have never ceased continually harping upon this
theme; but as for all other things, plots, enmities, frauds, calumnies,
insults, accusations, confiscation, exile, the keen sword of the enemy,
the peril of the deep, warfare of the whole world, or anything else you
like to name, they are but idle tales. For whatever the nature of these
things may be they are transitory and perishable, and operate in a
mortal body without doing any injury to the vigilant soul. Therefore the
blessed Paul, desiring to prove the insignificance both of the pleasures
and sorrows relating to this life, declared the whole truth in one
sentence when he said—“For the things which are seen are
temporal.” <span id="fr_909"></span>[910](#fn_909.md) Why then dost thou
fear temporal things which pass away like the stream of a river. For
such is the nature of present things whether they be pleasant or
painful. And another prophet compared all human prosperity not to grass,
but to another material even more flimsy, describing the whole of it “as
the flower of grass.” For he did not single out any one part of it, as
wealth alone, or luxury alone, or power, or honour; but having comprised
all the things which are esteemed splendid amongst men under the one
designa<span id="page_290">p. 290</span> <span
id="xvii.iii-Page_290"></span>tion of glory he said “all the glory of
man is as the flower of grass.” <span id="fr_910"></span>[911](#fn_910.md)

<span id="xvii.iii-p9"></span>2. Nevertheless, you will say, adversity
is a terrible thing and grievous to be borne. Yet look at it again
compared with another image and then also learn to despise it. For the
railings, and insults, and reproaches, and gibes inflicted by enemies,
and their plots are compared to a worn-out garment, and moth-eaten wool
when God says “Fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be ye afraid of
their revilings, for they shall wax old as doth a garment, and like
moth-eaten wool so shall they be consumed.” <span
id="fr_911"></span>[912](#fn_911.md) Therefore let none of these things
which are happening trouble thee, but ceasing to invoke the aid of this
or that person, and to run after shadows (for such are human alliances),
do thou persistently call upon Jesus, whom thou servest, merely to bow
his head; and in a moment of time all these evils will be dissolved. But
if thou hast already called upon Him, and yet they have not been
dissolved, such is the manner of God’s dealing (for I will resume my
former argument); He does not put down evils at the outset, but when
they have grown to a head, when scarcely any form of the enemy’s malice
remains ungratified, then He suddenly converts all things to a state of
tranquillity and conducts them to an unexpected settlement. For He is
not only able to turn as many things as we expect and hope, to good, but
many more, yea infinitely more. Wherefore also Paul saith “now to Him
who is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or
think.” <span id="fr_912"></span>[913](#fn_912.md) Could He not, for
example, have prevented the three children at the outset from falling
into trial? But He did not choose to do this, thereby conferring great
pain upon them. Therefore He suffered them to be delivered into the
hands of barbarians, and the furnace to be heated to an immeasurable
height and the wrath of the king to blaze even more fiercely than the
furnace, and hands and feet to be bound with great severity and they
themselves to be cast into the fire; and then, when all they who beheld
despaired of their rescue, suddenly, and beyond all hope, the
wonder-working power of God, the supreme artificer, was displayed, and
shone forth with exceeding splendour. For the fire was bound, and the
bondmen were released; and the furnace became a temple of prayer, a
place of fountains and dew, of higher dignity than a royal court, and
the very hairs of their head prevailed over that all devouring element
which gets the better even of iron and stone, and masters every kind of
substance. And a solemn song of universal praise was instituted there by
these holy men inviting every kind of created thing to join in the
wondrous melody; and they uttered hymns of thanksgiving to God for that
they had been bound, and also burnt, as far at least as the malice of
their enemies had power; that they had been exiles from their country,
captives deprived of their liberty, wandering outcasts from city and
home, sojourners in a strange and barbarous land; for all this was the
outpouring of a grateful heart. And when the malicious devices of their
enemies were perfected (for what further could they attempt after their
death?) and the labours of the heroes were completed, and the garland of
victory was woven, and their rewards were prepared and nothing more was
wanting for their renown; then at last their calamities were brought to
an end, and he who caused the furnace to be kindled, and delivered them
over to that great punishment, became himself the panegyrist of those
holy heroes, and the herald of God’s marvellous deed, and everywhere
throughout the world issued letters full of reverent praise, recording
what had taken place, and becoming the faithful herald of the miracles
wrought by the wonder-working God. For inasmuch as he had been an enemy
and adversary what he wrote was above suspicion even in the opinion of
enemies.

<span id="xvii.iii-p12"></span>3. Dost thou see the abundance of
resource belonging to God? His wisdom, His extraordinary power, His
loving-kindness and care? Be not therefore dismayed or troubled but
continue to give thanks to God for all things, praising, and invoking
Him; beseeching and supplicating; even if countless tumults and troubles
come upon thee, even if tempests are stirred up before thy eyes let none
of these things disturb thee. For our Master is not baffled by the
difficulty, even if all things are reduced to the extremity of ruin. For
it is possible for Him to raise those who have fallen, to convert those
who are in error, to set straight those who have been ensnared, to
release those who have been laden with countless sins, and make them
righteous, to quicken those who are dead, to restore lustre to decayed
things, and freshness to those which have waxen old. For if He makes
things which are not, come into being, and bestows existence on things
which are nowhere by any means manifest, how much more will He rectify
things which already exist. But you will say there are many who perish,
many who are caught by snares. Many such things have indeed often taken
place, yet afterwards have all received their appropriate correction,
save some few who have remained in an incurable condition, even after
the change in their circumstances. Why are you troubled and distracted
because such a person is cast out and <span id="page_291">p. 291</span>
<span id="xvii.iii-Page_291"></span>such another is put into his place?
Christ was crucified and the release of Barabbas the robber was
demanded, and the depraved populace clamoured for the preservation of
the murderer rather than of the Saviour and benefactor. How many think
you then stumbled at these things? how many were destroyed? But I must
carry my argument yet further back. Did not He who was crucified become
immediately after his birth a wanderer and a fugitive? was He not from
the very cradle removed with the whole household into a strange land,
taking that long journey into a barbarous region? And this removal gave
occasion to torrents of blood, and cruel murder and slaughter, and all
the children of tender age were cut to pieces just as if they had been
soldiers arrayed in battle, and infants torn from the breast were handed
over to death, and even when the milk was in their throats, the sword
was driven through their necks. What could be more distressing than this
tragedy? And these things were done by him who sought to destroy Jesus,
yet the long-suffering God endured this tragical cruelty, which caused
so much bloodshed, and forbore to prevent it although He had the power,
displaying his long-suffering for some inscrutably wise purpose. And
when Jesus had returned from the foreign land and was grown up, war was
rekindled against him on every side. First of all the disciples of John
were envious of Him and tried to slander Him, although John himself
behaved reverently to Him, and they said “He who was with thee beyond
Jordan, behold the same baptizeth and all men come to Him.” <span
id="fr_913"></span>[914](#fn_913.md) For these were the words of men who
were already irritated, and agitated by ill-will, and consumed by that
passion. For the same reason also one of the disciples who said these
things disputed with a certain Jew and raised a contentious argument
about purifying, comparing one kind of baptism with another, the baptism
of John with that of the disciples of Christ. “For there arose” it is
said, “a questioning on the part of John’s disciples with a certain Jew
about purifying.” <span id="fr_914"></span>[915](#fn_914.md) And when He
began to work miracles how many calumniators He had! Some called Him a
Samaritan and demoniac saying “Thou art a Samaritan and hast a
Devil” <span id="fr_915"></span>[916](#fn_915.md) others “a deceiver,”
saying “This man is not of God but deceiveth the multitude” <span
id="fr_916"></span>[917](#fn_916.md) others “a sorcerer” saying “He casteth
out devils through Beelzebub the prince of the Devils” <span
id="fr_917"></span>[918](#fn_917.md) and they continually said these things
against Him and called Him an adversary of God, and a gluttonous, and
greedy man, and a drunkard, and a friend of the wicked and depraved.
“For” He said, “the Son of man came eating and drinking and they say
behold a gluttonous man and a wine-bibber, a friend of publicans and
sinners.” <span id="fr_918"></span>[919](#fn_918.md) And when he was
conversing with the harlot they called Him a false prophet; “For had He
been a prophet,” one said, “He would have known who this woman is which
speaketh unto Him;” <span id="fr_919"></span>[920](#fn_919.md) in fact
every day they sharpened their teeth against Him. And not only did the
Jews thus oppose Him, but even those who were reputed to be his brethren
were not sincerely attached to Him, but even out of his own family
opposition was kindled against Him. See at least how they also
themselves were perverted, from the evangelist adding the remark “for
neither did His brethren believe on Him.” <span
id="fr_920"></span>[921](#fn_920.md)

<span id="xvii.iii-p21"></span>4. But since you call to mind many who
were offended and went astray, how many of the disciples do you suppose
were offended at the time of the crucifixion? One betrayed Him, the
others took to flight, one denied Him, and when all had abandoned Him He
was led away bound without companions. How many then think you who had
lately seen Him working His miracles, raising the dead, cleansing
lepers, casting out devils, multiplying loaves, and doing all other
kinds of wonderful deeds, were offended at that season, when they beheld
Him led away and bound, surrounded by common soldiers, and followed by
Jewish priests making a tumult and uproar; alone in the midst hemmed in
by all his enemies, and the traitor standing by and exulting in his
deed? And what was the effect think you when He was being scourged? and
probably a vast multitude was present. For it was an illustrious
festival which brought all together, and this drama of iniquity was
enacted in the capital city, and in the very middle of the day. How many
think you who were present then were offended when they saw Him bound,
scourged, streaming with blood, examined before the governor’s tribunal,
and not one of His disciples standing by? What was the effect again when
He was subjected to those manifold kinds of mockery, successively
repeated, when they crowned Him with thorns, then arrayed Him in a
gorgeous robe, then put a reed in His hand, then fell down and
worshipped Him, setting in motion every species of ribaldry and
derision? How many think you were offended, how many bewildered, how
many perplexed when they smote Him on the cheek and said “prophesy unto
us thou Christ who is He that smote thee?” <span
id="fr_921"></span>[922](#fn_921.md) and when they led <span
id="page_292">p. 292</span> <span id="xvii.iii-Page_292"></span>Him
hither and thither, and spent the whole day in scoffs and abuse, and
ribaldry and derision in the midst of the Jewish assembly? and when the
servant of the High-Priest dealt Him a blow; and when the soldiers
parted His garments amongst them and when He was led up to the cross,
having the marks of the scourge upon His back, and was fastened to the
wood, how many think you were offended? For not even then were those
savage beasts softened, but became more furious than before, and the
tragedy became more intense, and the ribaldry increased. For some said
“Ah! thou that destroyest the temple, and in three days buildest it
up;” <span id="fr_922"></span>[923](#fn_922.md) and some, “He saved others,
Himself He cannot save.” <span id="fr_923"></span>[924](#fn_923.md)

<span id="xvii.iii-p25"></span>And others said “If thou art the Son of
God come down from the cross and we will believe thee.” <span
id="fr_924"></span>[925](#fn_924.md)

<span id="xvii.iii-p27"></span>Again when they insulted Him by offering
Him gall and vinegar on the sponge how many think you were offended? or
when the robbers reviled Him? or when as I have already said, they made
that dreadful and monstrous assertion that the robber and housebreaker,
the man laden with the crime of murder deserved to be released rather
than Jesus, and having received permission from the judge to make their
choice preferred Barabbas, desiring not only to crucify Christ, but also
to involve Him in infamy? For they thought that by these means they
should be able to manufacture the belief that He was worse than the
robber, and such a great transgressor that neither on the plea of mercy,
nor of the privilege of the Festival was it possible to save Him. For
they did everything with a view to slander His fame; which also was the
reason why they crucified the two robbers with Him. Nevertheless the
truth was not obscured, but shone forth all the more clearly. And they
accused Him of usurping kingly power saying “Every one who maketh
himself a king is not a friend of Cæsar” <span
id="fr_925"></span>[926](#fn_925.md) bringing this charge of usurpation
against one who had not where to lay his head. Moreover they brought a
calumnious accusation of blasphemy against Him. For the High Priest rent
his clothes saying “He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we
of witnesses?” <span id="fr_926"></span>[927](#fn_926.md) And what was the
nature of his death? was it not a violent one? was it not the death of
capital offenders? of execrable criminals? was it not of the vilest
kind? was it not the death of those who have perpetrated the worst
offences, and are not worthy to draw even their last breath upon the
earth? And then as to the manner of his burial, was it not accomplished
as a matter of favour? For a certain one came and begged for his body.
Thus not even he who buried Him belonged to his own friends, to those
whom He had benefited, to his disciples, to those who had enjoyed such
free and salutary intercourse with Him, for all had taken to flight, all
had hurried away from Him. And that base suspicion which his enemies
contrived in consequence of the resurrection when they said “His
disciples came and stole Him” <span id="fr_927"></span>[928](#fn_927.md)
how many think you were offended, how many for a time upset by that? For
the story prevailed at that time, although it was a fabrication, and was
bought for money; nevertheless it held its ground amongst some people,
after the seals (of the sepulchre were broken) <span
id="fr_928"></span>[929](#fn_928.md) after the manifest appearance of the
truth. For the multitude did not know the prediction of the resurrection
(and no wonder), inasmuch as even his disciples did not understand it;
for we read “they did not know that He must rise again from the
dead.” <span id="fr_929"></span>[930](#fn_929.md) How many therefore think
you were offended in those days? And yet the long-suffering God
patiently endured, ordering all things according to His own inscrutable
wisdom.

<span id="xvii.iii-p33"></span>5. Then again after those days the
disciples continued to live in hiding and secrecy, being fugitives full
of fear and trembling, continually shifting from place to place, and
even when they began to appear after fifty days, and to work miracles,
they did not enjoy perfect security; but even after those events there
were innumerable stumbling-blocks to offend the weaker brethren, when
they were scourged, when the Church was distressed, when they themselves
were driven away, and their enemies had the upper hand in many places,
and raised tumults. For when they had acquired much confidence by means
of the miracles which they wrought, then the death of Stephen again
caused a severe persecution, and dispersed them all, and involved the
Church in confusion; and the disciples were again alarmed, fugitive, and
distressed. And yet the Church continually grew, when it flourished by
means of the signs which were wrought and became illustrious from the
manner of its introduction. One disciple for example was let down
through a window, and so escaped the hands of the ruler; others were
brought out of prison by an angel and so released from their fetters;
others were received into the houses of common people and artisans when
they were driven out by those in authority; they were courteously
treated in every way, by female sellers of purple, by tentmakers, and
<span id="page_293">p. 293</span> <span
id="xvii.iii-Page_293"></span>tanners dwelling in the outskirts of the
cities, and by the sea shore. Frequently moreover they did not dare to
appear in the middle of the towns; and if they did venture there
themselves their entertainers did not. And thus amidst alternate trials,
and respites from trial, the fabric of the Church was wrought, and they
who once stumbled were afterwards set upright, and they who wandered
away were brought back, and the ruined places were built up more firmly
than before. For this cause when Paul prayed that the preaching of the
word might proceed by a smooth course only, God rich in wisdom and
resource did not yield to His disciple; nay even when many times invoked
he would not consent but said “my grace is sufficient for thee, for my
strength is made perfect in weakness.” <span
id="fr_930"></span>[931](#fn_930.md) If then even now you will reckon up
the good things with the painful, you will see that many events have
occurred which if not positive signs and wonders do yet resemble signs,
and are unspeakable proofs of the great providence and succour of God.
But that you may not hear everything from me without any trouble, I
leave this as thy task, that you may reckon up everything accurately and
compare them with the misfortunes, and by occupying yourself with this
good employment may divert your mind from despondency; for you will
derive much consolation from this work.

<span id="xvii.iii-p35"></span>Pray say many kind words from me to all
your blessed household. May you continue in good health and good
spirits, most reverend and divinely favoured lady.

<span id="xvii.iii-p36"></span>If you wish me to write long letters
inform me of this, and pray do not deceive me by saying that you have
thrown off all despondency, and are enjoying a season of rest. For
letters are a remedy of the proper kind to produce great cheerfulness in
thee, and you will continually see letters from me. And when you write
to me again do not say “I have much comfort from your letters,” for this
I know of myself, but tell me that you have as much as I wish you to
have, that you are not confounded with sorrow, that you do not pass your
time in weeping, but in serenity and cheerfulness.
