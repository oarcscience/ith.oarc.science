<span id="vii.ii-p1"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="vii.ii-p1.1"></span>INTRODUCTION TO THE HOMILIES ON S. IGNATIUS AND
S. BABYLAS.</span>

<span id="vii.ii-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="vii.ii-p2.1"></span>The</span> following have been selected out of a
large number delivered by Chrysostom on the festivals of saints and
martyrs, not only because they are good samples of his discourses on
such occasions, but also on account of the celebrity of the two saints
in whose honour they were spoken. There is really very little known
about Ignatius beyond the fact that he was Bishop of Antioch, and
suffered martyrdom at Rome in the reign of Trajan about the year 110
<span class="c12"><span id="vii.ii-p2.2"></span> a.d.</span>: being torn
to death by wild beasts in the colossal amphitheatre erected for the
display of such inhuman sports by the emperors of the Flavian dynasty.
The tradition that he was a disciple of St. John does not rest on any
trustworthy evidence, but on the other hand there is nothing inherently
impossible or even improbable in the supposition.

<span id="vii.ii-p3"></span>According to a tradition which cannot be
traced back earlier than the latter part of the fourth century the
reliques were translated from Rome to Antioch and deposited in the
Christian cemetery outside the gates called the Daphnitic gate, because
it led from the city to the famous suburb of Daphne, on which we shall
have more to say presently. It is clear from the following eulogy that
Chrysostom accepted this tradition, and his repeated invitation to his
hearers to “come hither” to enjoy the beneficent influence of the saint
seems to imply that his discourse was delivered in the “martyr,” that is
the chapel erected to contain the martyr’s remains, not in the “Great
Church” of Antioch where he commonly preached. In the next generation
the reliques of the saint were again translated by the Emperor, the
younger Theodosius, to the building which had been the temple of the
“Fortune of Antioch,” and then the illustrious Christian martyr was
substituted for the mythical goddess on the tutelary genius of the city.

<span id="vii.ii-p4"></span>The fame of S. Babylas rivalled and for a
time almost threatened to overshadow that of S. Ignatius. He had been
Bishop of Antioch about 237 to 250. The heroic courage with which he had
once repulsed the Emperor Philip from the church until he should have
submitted to penance for some offence committed, and his martyrdom in
the persecution under Decius were his original claims to popular
veneration. But some later events shed a fresh lustre on his name. In
the year 351 the Cæsar Gallus, brother of Julian, being resident in
Antioch, transferred the reliques of Babylas from their resting place
within the city to the beautiful suburb the garden or grove of Daphne.
“In the history of this spot we have a singular instance of the way in
which Grecian legend was transplanted into foreign soil. Daphne the
daughter of the river-god Ladon were according to the Syrian version of
the myth, overtaken by her lover Apollo near Antioch. Here it was, on
the banks not of the Peneus but of the Oronete, that the maiden prayed
to her mother earth to open her arms and shelter her from the pursuit of
the amorous god, and that the laurel plant sprang out of the spot where
she vanished from the eyes of her disappointed lover. The house of
Seleucus Nicator, founder of the Syrian monarchy was said to have struck
his hoof upon one of the arrows dropped by Apollo in the hurry of his
pursuit; in consequence of which the king dedicated the place to the
god. A temple was erected in his honour, ample in its proportions,
sumptuous in its adornments; the internal walls were resplendent with
polished marbles, the <span id="page_132">p. 132</span> <span
id="vii.ii-Page_132"></span>lofty ceiling was of cypress wood. The
colossal image of the god, enriched with gold and gems, nearly reached
the top of the roof. \* \* \* With one hand the deity lightly touched
the lyre which hung from his shoulders and in the other he held a golden
dish, as if about to pour a libation on the earth “and supplicate the
venerable mother to give to his arms the cold and beauteous
Daphne.” <span id="fr_363"></span>[364](#fn_363.md) The whole grove became
consecrated to pleasure under the guise of festivity in honor of the
god. \* \* \* It contained everything which could gratify and charm the
senses; the deep impenetrable shade of cypress trees, the delicious
noise and coolness of falling waters, the fragrance of aromatic shrubs;
there were also baths, and grottos, porticoes, and colonnades. Such
materials for voluptuous enjoyment told with fatal effect upon the
morals of a people addicted at all times to an immoderate indulgence in
luxurious pleasure. <span id="fr_364"></span>[365](#fn_364.md) Daphne
became one of those places where gross and shameless vice was practised
under the sanction of religion. The intention of Cæsar Gallus in
translating the reliques of Babylas to Daphne was as Chrysostom
expresses it to “bring a physician to the sick;” to introduce a pure and
Christian association into a spot hitherto consecrated to Pagan and
licentious rites. The bones of the saint were laid near the shrine of
Apollo, and the Christian church standing hard by the heathen temple was
a visible warning to any Christian who might visit the place to abstain
from deeds abhorrent to the faith for which the bishop had died. But the
remains of the martyr were not permitted to rest in peace. When the
Emperor Julian visited Antioch 362, he consulted the oracle of Apollo at
Daphne respecting the issue of the expedition which he was about to make
into Persia. But the oracle was dumb. At length the god yielded to the
importunity of prayers and sacrifices so far as to explain the cause of
his silence. He was offended by the proximity of dead men. “Break open
the sepulchres, take up the bones, and carry them hence.” No name was
mentioned, but the demand was interpreted as referring to the remains of
Babylas, and the wishes of the affronted deity were complied with. The
Christians were commanded by Julian to remove the bones of their saint
from the neighbourhood of Apollo’s sanctuary. They obeyed, but what was
intended to be a humiliation was converted into a triumph. The reliques
were conveyed to their resting place within the city as in a kind of
festive procession, accompanied by crowds along the whole way, four or
five miles, chanting the words of the Psalm, “Confounded be all they
that worship carved images and delight in vain gods.” In vain were some
of the Christians seized and tortured. The popularity of the saint grew
in proportion as Julian tried to put it down; and the insults done to
him were speedily avenged. A fire, mysterious in its origin, broke out
soon after the removal of the martyr’s reliques in the shrine of Apollo,
consuming the roof of the building, and the statue of the god. At the
time when Chrysostom preached, about twenty years later, the columns and
walls were still standing, the melancholy wreck serving as a memorial
and witness of the judgment which had fallen upon the place.

<span id="vii.ii-p7"></span>The remains of Babylas were not brought back
to Daphne, but removed from the city to a magnificent church built to
receive them on the other side of Orontes. Near the close of his
discourse Chrysostom refers to the erection of this church and to the
zeal of the Bishop Meletius in promoting it, who actually took part in
the work with his own hands, as we are told that Hugh did in the
building of the Minster at Lincoln. But although the body of the martyr
rested elsewhere, his spirit and influence were supposed to inhabit in a
special manner the spot where he had put the heathen deity to silence
and shame, and to confer blessings on the pilgrims who resorted in
crowds to his martyr in Daphne. The ruined and deserted temple indeed,
and the well preserved Christian church thronged with worshippers,
standing as they did side by side, formed a striking emblem of the two
religions to which they were devoted—the one destined to crumble and
vanish away, the other to endure and conquer.
