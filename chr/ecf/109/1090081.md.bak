<span id="xvii.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c34"><span

<span id="xvii.vi-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="xvii.vi-p2.1"></span>Why</span> do you lament? why do you belabour
yourself, and demand of yourself a punishment which your enemies were
not able to demand from you, having thus abandoned your soul to the
tyranny of dejection? For the letters which you sent to me by the hands
of Patricius have discovered to me the wounds which have been inflicted
on your mind. Wherefore also I am very sorrowful and much distressed
that when you ought to be using every exertion and making it your
business to expel dejection from your soul, you go about collecting
distressing thoughts, even inventing things (so you say) which do not
exist, and tearing yourself to pieces for no purpose, and to your very
great injury. For why are you grieved because you could not remove me
from Cucusus? Yet indeed, as far as you were concerned, you did remove
me, having made every exertion and endeavour for this purpose. And even
if it has not been actually accomplished you ought not to be vexed on
<span id="page_299">p. 299</span> <span
id="xvii.vi-Page_299"></span>that account. For perhaps it seemed good to
God that I should be set to run the longer double course, <span
id="fr_949"></span>[950](#fn_949.md) in order that the garland of victory
might be rendered more glorious. Why then are you vexed on account of
these things, in consequence of which my fame is spread abroad, when you
ought to leap and dance for joy and bind wreaths upon your brow, because
I have been deemed worthy of so great an honour which far exceeds my
merits? Is it the desolation of this place which grieves you? Yet what
can be pleasanter than my sojourn here? I have quietness, and
tranquillity, plenty of leisure and good bodily health. For although the
town has neither market-place nor market that is nothing to me. For all
things are poured abundantly upon me as out of a flowing spring. I find
my lord the Bishop here and my lord Dioscorus are constantly employed in
providing for my refreshment. And the good Patricius will tell you that
as far as my sojourn here is concerned I pass my time cheerfully and
gladly, surrounded by attention. But if you lament the events which
occurred in Cæsarea, here again your conduct is unworthy of yourself.
For there also bright garlands of victory were woven for me, inasmuch as
all were proclaiming and publishing my praises, and expressing wonder
and astonishment at the ill-treatment to which I had been subjected
followed by expulsion. Meanwhile however do not let any one know these
things, although they are the theme of much gossip. For my lord Pœanius
has disclosed to me that the presbyters of Pharetrius himself <span
id="fr_950"></span>[951](#fn_950.md) have arrived on the spot, who declare
that they were in communion with me and had no communication or
intercourse or partnership with my adversaries. Therefore to avoid
upsetting them do not let any one know these things. For certainly the
things which befell me were very grievous: and if I had not suffered any
other distress the events which happened there would have sufficed to
procure innumerable rewards for me: so extreme was the danger which I
encountered. Now I beseech you to keep these matters secret, and so I
will give you a short account of them, not in order to grieve you but
rather to make you glad. For herein consists the material of my gain,
herein consists my wealth, herein the means of getting rid of my
sins—that my journey is continually encompassed by trials of this kind,
and that they are inflicted upon me by persons from whom they were quite
unexpected. For when I was about to enter the region of Cappadocia,
having escaped from that man of Galatia, who nearly threatened me with
death, <span id="fr_951"></span>[952](#fn_951.md) many persons met me on
the way saying “the lord Pharetrius is awaiting you, and going about in
all directions for fear of missing the pleasure of meeting you, and
making every possible endeavour to see you, and embrace you, and show
you all manner of affectionate regard; and he has set the monasteries of
men and women in motion for this purpose.” Now when I heard these things
I did not expect that any of them would really take place, but formed an
impression in my own mind precisely the reverse: but of this I said
nothing to any of those who brought me this message.

<span id="xvii.vi-p6"></span>2. Now when I arrived late one evening at
Cæsarea, in an exhausted and worn-out condition, being in the very
height of a burning fever, faint and suffering to the last degree, I
lighted upon an inn situated just at the outskirts of the city, and took
great pains to find some physicians and allay this fiery fever; for it
was now the height of my tertian malady. And in addition to this there
was the fatigue of the journey, the toil, the strain, the total absence
of attendants, the difficulty of getting supplies, the want of a
physician, the wasting effects of toil, and heat and sleeplessness; thus
I was well nigh a dead man when I entered the city. Then indeed I was
visited by the whole body of the clergy, and the people, monks, nuns,
physicians, and I had the benefit of great attention, as all paid me
every kind of ministration and assistance. Yet even thus, being
oppressed by the lethargy arising from the feverish heat I was in an
extremely distressed condition. At length by degrees the malady was
coming to an end and abating. Pharetrius however nowhere appeared; but
waited for my departure, I know not with what purpose in view. When then
I saw that my disorder had slightly abated I began to form plans for my
journey so as to reach Cucusus, and enjoy a little repose after the
calamities of the way. And whilst I was thus situated it was suddenly
announced that the Isaurians <span id="fr_952"></span>[953](#fn_952.md) in
countless multitudes were overrunning the district of Cæsarea, and had
burnt a large village, and were most violently disposed. The tribune,
having heard this, took the soldiers which he had and went out. For they
were afraid lest the enemy should make an assault also upon <span
id="page_300">p. 300</span> <span id="xvii.vi-Page_300"></span>the city,
and all were in terror, and in an agony of alarm the very soil of their
country being in jeopardy, so that even the old men undertook the
defence of the walls. While affairs were in this condition suddenly
towards dawn a rabble <span id="fr_953"></span>[954](#fn_953.md) of monks
(for so I must call them, indicating their frenzy by the expression)
rushed up to the house where we were, threatening to set fire to it, and
to treat us with the utmost violence unless we turned out of it. And
neither the fear of the Isaurians, nor my own infirmity which was so
grievously afflicting me, nor anything else made them more reasonable,
but they pressed on, animated by such fierce rage that even the
proconsular soldiers were terrified. For they kept threatening them with
blows and boasted that they had shamefully beaten many of the
proconsular soldiers. The soldiers having heard these things, sought
refuge with me, and entreated and beseeched me, saying “even if we are
to fall into the hands of the Isaurians deliver us from these wild
beasts.” When the governor heard this he hastened down to the house
intending to succour me. But the monks would not pay any heed to his
exhortations, and in fact he was powerless. Perceiving the great strait
in which affairs were placed and not daring to advise me either to go
out to certain death, or on the other hand to stay indoors, owing to the
excessive fury of these men, he sent to Pharetrius beseeching him to
grant a few days respite on account of my infirmity and the impending
danger. But even then nothing was effected, and on the morrow the monks
arrived even fiercer than before, and none of the presbyters dared to
stand by me and help me, but covered with shame and blushes (for they
said that these things were done by the instructions of Pharetrius) they
concealed themselves and lay hid, not responding even when I called
them. What need to make a long story? Although such great terrors were
imminent, and death well nigh a certainty, and the fever was oppressing
me (for I had not yet got relief from the troubles arising from that
cause) I flung myself at high noon into the litter, and was carried out
thence, all the people shrieking and howling, and imprecating curses on
the perpetrator of these deeds, whilst every one wailed and lamented.
But when I got outside the city, some of the clergy also gradually came
out and escorted me, mourning as they went. And having heard some
persons say “Where are you leading him away to manifest death?” one of
those who was warmly attached to me said to me “Depart I entreat you;
fall into the hands of the Isaurians, provided you get clear away from
us. For wherever you may fall, you will fall into a place of security,
if only you escape our hands.” Having heard and seen these things the
good Seleucia, the generous wife of my lord Ruffinus (a most attentive
friend she was to me), exhorted and entreated me to lodge at her
suburban house which was about five miles from the city and she sent
some men to escort me, and so I departed thither.

<span id="xvii.vi-p9"></span>3. But not even there was this plot against
me to come to an end. For as soon as Pharetrius knew what she had done,
he published, as she said, many threats against her. But when she
received me into her suburban villa I knew nothing of these things; for
when she came out to meet me she concealed these things from me, but
disclosed them to her steward who was there, and ordered him to afford
me every possible means of repose, and if any of the monks should make
an assault, wishing to insult or maltreat me, he was to collect the
labourers from her other farms, and thus marshal a force against them.
Moreover she besought me to take refuge in her house, which had a
fortress and was impregnable, that I might escape the hands of the
bishop and monks. This however I could not be induced to do, but
remained in the villa, knowing nothing of the plans which were devised
after these things. For even then they were not content to desist from
their fury against me but Pharetrius beset the lady as she says,
straitly threatening her, constraining and forcing her to expel me even
from the suburbs, so that at midnight, I knowing nothing of these
things, the lady being unable to endure his annoyance, announced,
without my knowledge, that the barbarians were at hand, for she was
ashamed to mention the compulsion which she had undergone. So in the
middle of the night Evethius the presbyter came to me, and having roused
me from sleep, exclaimed with a loud voice “Get up, I pray you, the
barbarians are upon us, they are close at hand.” Imagine my condition on
hearing this! Then, when I said to him what must we do? we cannot take
refuge in the city lest we suffer worse things than what the Isaurians
are going to do to us, he compelled me to go out. It was midnight, a
dark, murky night without a moon—a circumstance which filled up the
measure of our perplexity—we had no companion, no assistant, for all had
deserted us. Nevertheless under the pressure of fear and in the
expectation of immediate death, I got up, suffering as I was, having
ordered <span id="page_301">p. 301</span> <span
id="xvii.vi-Page_301"></span>torches to be lit. These however the
presbyter ordered to be put out, for fear as he said lest the barbarians
should be attracted by the light and attack us; so the torches were
extinguished. Then the mule which carried my litter fell on its knees,
the road being rugged, and steep and stony, and I who was inside was
thrown down and narrowly escaped destruction, after which I dismounted,
and was dragged along on foot, being held fast by Evethius the presbyter
(for he also had alighted from his mule), and so I plodded on, led, or
rather hauled by the hand, for to walk was impossible through such a
difficult country, and amongst steep mountains in the middle of the
night. Imagine what my sufferings must have been, encompassed as I was
by such calamities, and oppressed by the fever, ignorant of the plans
which had been made, but in terror of the barbarians and trembling. with
the expectation of falling into their hands. Do you not think that these
sufferings alone, even if nothing else besides had befallen me, would
avail to blot out many of my sins, and afford ample material for
obtaining praise with God? Now the reason of all this, at least as I
suppose, was, that as soon as I arrived in Cæsarea, those who were in
official positions, the learned men who were ex-vicars, and
ex-governors, the ex-tribunes and indeed the whole people visited me
every day, paid me great attention, and treated me as the apple of their
eye; I suppose these things irritated Pharetrius and that the envy which
drove me from Constantinople did not refrain from pursuing me even here.
This at least is what I suppose, for I do not positively declare it but
only suspect it to be the fact.

<span id="xvii.vi-p10"></span>And what is one to say about the other
events which happened on the way, the fears and the perils? as I recall
them day by day, and continually bear them in mind, I am elated with
pleasure, I leap for joy as one who has a great treasure laid up in
store for him; for such is my position and feeling about them. Wherefore
also I beseech your Honour to rejoice at these things, to be glad, and
leap for joy, and to glorify God who has counted me worthy to suffer
such things. And I beseech you to keep these matters to yourself, and
not to divulge them to any one, although for the most part the
proconsular soldiers can fill all the city (with the story) as they
themselves have undergone extreme danger.

<span id="xvii.vi-p11"></span>4. Nevertheless do not let any one know
this from your prudence, but rather put down those who talk about it.
But if you are distressed lest the consequences of my ill-treatment
should remain, know for certain that I have shaken myself entirely free
from them, and that I am in better bodily health than when I was
sojourning in Cæsarea. And why do you dread the cold? for a suitable
dwelling has been prepared for me, and my lord Dioscorus does and
arranges everything so as to prevent my having the least sensation of
cold. And if I may form a conjecture from the outset of my experience,
the climate now seems to me oriental in character, no less than that of
Antioch. So great is the warmth, so pleasant is the temperature. But you
have grieved me much by saying, “perhaps you are annoyed with me as
having neglected you,” yet I despatched a letter many days ago to your
honour begging you not to move me from this place. Now I have had
occasion to consider that you need a strong defence and much toil and
labour to be able to make a satisfactory apology for this expression.
But perhaps you have made a partial apology, by saying “I am generally
occupied in thinking how to increase my affliction.” But I in my turn
reckon it as the greatest accusation that you should say “I take a pride
in increasing my sorrow by thinking over it:” for when you ought to make
every possible effort to dispel your affliction you do the devil’s will,
by increasing your despondency and sorrow. Are you not aware how great
an evil despondency is?

<span id="xvii.vi-p12"></span>As to the Isaurians, dismiss your fears in
future concerning them: for they have returned into their own country:
and the governor has done everything necessary in this respect; and I am
in far greater security here than when I was in Cæsarea. For in future I
have no one to fear so much as the bishops, with a few exceptions. On
account of the Isaurians then fear nothing: for they have retreated, and
when winter has set in they are confined to their own homes, although
they may possibly come out after Whitsuntide. And what do you mean by
saying that you have not the benefit of letters from me? I have already
sent you three long letters, one by the proconsular soldiers, one by
Antonius, and the third by Anatolius my servant; two of them were a
salutary medicine capable of reviving any one who was desponding or
stumbling, and conducting him into a healthy state of serenity. When you
have received these letters then go over them constantly and thoroughly,
and you will perceive their force and enjoy experience of their healing
power, and benefit, and will inform me that you have derived much
advantage therefrom. I have also a third letter ready, similar to these,
which I do not choose to send at the present <span id="page_302">p.
302</span> <span id="xvii.vi-Page_302"></span>time having been
exceedingly vexed at your saying “I accumulate sorrowful thoughts, even
inventing things which do not exist,” an utterance unworthy of yourself,
which makes me hide my head for shame. But read those letters which I
have sent, and you will no longer say these things, even if you are
infinitely bent on being despondent. <span
id="fr_954"></span>[955](#fn_954.md) I at least have not ceased, and will
not cease saying that sin is the only thing which is really distressing;
and that all other things are but dust and smoke. For what is there
grievous in inhabiting a prison and wearing a chain? or in being
ill-treated when it is the occasion of so much gain? or why should exile
be grievous or confiscation of goods? These are mere words, destitute of
any terrible reality, words void of sorrow. For if you speak of death
you only mention that which is the debt of nature: a thing which must in
any case be undergone even if no one hastens it: and if you speak of
exile you mention that which only involves a change of country and the
sight of many cities: or if you speak of confiscation of goods you
mention what is only freedom and emancipation from care.

<span id="xvii.vi-p14"></span>5. Do not cease to pay attention to
Maruthas the Bishop, as far as it concerns you, so as to lift him up out
of the pit. <span id="fr_955"></span>[956](#fn_955.md) For I have special
need of him on account of the affairs in Persia. And ascertain from him,
if you can, what has been accomplished there through his agency, and for
what purpose he has come home, and let me know whether you have
delivered the two epistles which I sent to him: and if he is willing to
write to me, I will write again to him: but if he should not be willing
let him at least signify to your prudence whether any thing more has
taken place there, and whether he is likely to accomplish anything by
going thither again. For on this account I was anxious to have an
interview with him. Nevertheless let all things which depend on you be
done, and take care to fulfill your own part, even if all men are
rushing headlong to ruin. For your reward will thus be perfected. By all
means therefore make friends with him as far as it is possible. I
beseech you not to neglect what I am about to say, but to pay diligent
heed to it. The Marsian and Gothic monks where the Bishop Serapion has
constantly been concealed have informed me that Moduarius the deacon has
come bringing word that Unilas, that excellent bishop whom I lately
ordained and sent into Gothia, has been laid to rest, after achieving
many great exploits: and the deacon was the bearer of a letter from the
king of the Goths begging that a bishop might be sent to them. Since
then I see no other means of meeting the threatened catastrophe with a
view to its correction save delay and postponement (as it is impossible
for them to sail into the Bosporus or into those parts at the present
time), take measures to put them off for a time on account of the winter
season: and do not by any means neglect this: for it is a matter of the
greatest importance. For there are two things which would specially
distress me if they were to happen, which God forbid: one is that a
bishop should be appointed by these men who have wrought such great
wickedness, <span id="fr_956"></span>[957](#fn_956.md) and who have no
right to appoint, and the other is that any one should be made without
consideration. For you know yourself that they are not anxious to create
some worthy man bishop, and if this should take place, which heaven
forbid, you are aware what will follow. Use all diligence therefore to
prevent either of these things happening: but if it were possible for
Moduarius quietly and secretly to hasten out to me it would be of the
greatest advantage. But if this is not possible let what is practicable
under the circumstances be done. For that which takes place in the case
of money, and actually occurred in the case of the widow in the gospel,
also holds good in the case of practical affairs. For as that poor woman
when she had cast two mites into the treasury surpassed all those who
had cast in more, because she used up her whole substance: even so they
who devote themselves to the work in hand with all their might discharge
it completely, so far as they are concerned, even if nothing results
from it, and they have their reward perfected.

<span id="xvii.vi-p17"></span>I am very grateful to Hilarius the bishop:
for he wrote to me asking to be allowed to depart to his own country,
and to set things in order there, and then to come back again. As his
presence therefore is of great service (for he is a devout, inflexible,
and zealous man) I have urged him to depart and to return speedily. Take
care then that the letter is quickly and safely delivered to him and not
cast on one side: for he eagerly and earnestly begged for letters from
me, and his presence is a great benefit. By all means <span
id="page_303">p. 303</span> <span id="xvii.vi-Page_303"></span>therefore
have a care of the letters; and if Helladius the presbyter be not on the
spot see that they are delivered to my friends by the hands of some
discreet man who has a head on his shoulders.
