id="iii.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV</span><span class="c1"><span
id="iii.iv-p1.2"></span>.—*Chrysostom Evades Election to a Bishopric,
and Writes His Work on the Priesthood.*</span>

<span id="iii.iv-p2"></span>About this time several bishoprics were
vacant in Syria, and frequent depositions took <span id="page_8">p.
8</span> <span id="iii.iv-Page_8"></span>place with the changing
fortunes of orthodoxy and Arianism, and the interference of the court.
The attention of the clergy and the people turned to Chrysostom and his
friend Basil as suitable candidates for the episcopal office, although
they had not the canonical age of thirty. Chrysostom shrunk from the
responsibilities and avoided an election by a pious fraud. He apparently
assented to an agreement with Basil that both should either accept, or
resist the burden of the episcopate, but instead of that he concealed
himself and put forward his friend whom he accounted much more worthy of
the honor. Basil, under the impression that Chrysostom had already been
consecrated, reluctantly submitted to the election. When he discovered
the cheat, he upbraided his friend with the breach of compact, but
Chrysostom laughed and rejoiced at the success of his plot. This
conduct, which every sound Christian conscience must condemn, caused no
offense among the Christians of that age, still less among the heathen,
and was regarded as good management or “economy.” The moral character of
the deception was supposed to depend altogether on the motive, which
made it good or bad. Chrysostom appealed in justification of laudable
deception to the stratagems of war, the conduct of physicians in dealing
with refractory patients, to several examples of the Old Testament
(Abraham, Jacob, David), and to the conduct of the Apostle Paul in
circumcising Timothy for the sake of the Jews ([Acts xvi.
3](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#003)<span id="iii.iv-p2.1"></span>.md) and
in observing the ceremonial law in Jerusalem at the advice of James
([Acts xxi. 26](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#026.md)<span
id="iii.iv-p2.2"></span>).

<span id="iii.iv-p3"></span>The Jesuitical maxim, “the end justifies the
means,” is much older than Jesuitism, and runs through the whole
apocryphal, pseudo-prophetic, pseudo-apostolic, pseudo-Clementine and
pseudo-Isidorian literature of the early centuries. Several of the best
Fathers show a surprising want of a strict sense of veracity. They
introduce a sort of cheat even into their strange theory of redemption,
by supposing that the Devil caused the crucifixion under the delusion
that Christ was a mere man, and thus lost his claim upon the fallen
race. Origen, Chrysostom, and Jerome explain the offense of the
collision between Paul and Peter at Antioch ([Gal. ii.
11](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#011)<span id="iii.iv-p3.1"></span> sqq..md)
away by turning it into a theatrical and hypocritical farce, which was
shrewdly arranged by the two apostles for the purpose of convincing the
Jewish Christians that circumcision was not necessary. Against such
wretched exegesis the superior moral sense of Augustin rightly
protested, and Jerome changed his view on this particular passage. Here
is a point where the modern standard of ethics is far superior to that
of the Fathers, and more fully accords with the spirit of the New
Testament, which inculcates the strictest veracity as a fundamental
virtue. <span id="fr_8"></span>[9](#fn_8.md)

<span id="iii.iv-p5"></span>The escape from the episcopate was the
occasion for one of the best and most popular works of Chrysostom, the
Six Books *On the Priesthood*, which he wrote probably before his
ordination (between 375 and 381), or during his diaconate (between 381
and 386). It is composed in the form of a Platonic dialogue between
Chrysostom and Basil. He first vindicates by argument and examples his
well-meant but untruthful conduct towards his friend, and the advantages
of timely fraud; and then describes with youthful fervor and eloquence
the importance, duties and trials of the Christian ministry, without
distinguishing between the priestly and the episcopal office. He
elevates it above all other offices. He requires whole-souled
consecration to Christ and love to his flock. He points to the
Scriptures (quoting also from the Apocrypha) as the great weapon of the
minister. He assumes, as may be expected, the then prevailing conception
of a real priesthood and sacrifice, baptismal regeneration, the corporal
presence, the virtue of absolution, prayers for the dead, but is silent
about pope and councils, the orders of the clergy, prayers to saints,
forms of prayer, priestly vestments, incense, crosses and other
doctrines and ceremonies of the Greek and Roman churches. <span
id="page_9">p. 9</span> <span id="iii.iv-Page_9"></span>He holds up St.
Paul as a model for imitation. The sole object of the preacher must be
to please God rather than men ([Gal. i.
10](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#010)<span id="iii.iv-p5.1"></span>.md). “He
must not indeed despise approving demonstrations, but as little must he
court them, nor trouble himself when they are withheld.” He should
combine the qualities of dignity and humility, authority and
sociability, impartiality and courtesy, independence and lowliness,
strength and gentleness, and keep a single eye to the glory of Christ
and the welfare of the church.

<span id="iii.iv-p6"></span>This book is the most useful or at least the
best known among the works of Chrysostom, and is well calculated to
inspire a profound sense of the tremendous responsibilities of the
ministry. But it has serious defects, besides the objectionable
justification of pious fraud, and cannot satisfy the demands of an
evangelical minister. In all that pertains to the proper care of souls
it is inferior to the “Reformed Pastor” of Richard Baxter.
