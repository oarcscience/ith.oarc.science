<span id="ix.iii-p1"></span> <span id="page_165">p. 165</span> <span
id="ix.iii-Page_165"></span><span class="c34"><span
id="ix.iii-p1.1"></span>second instruction.</span>

<span id="ix.iii-p2"></span>To those about to be illuminated; and
concerning women who adorn themselves with plaiting of hair, and gold,
and concerning those who have used omens, and amulets, and incantations,
all which are foreign to Christianity.

<span id="ix.iii-p3"></span>1. <span class="c12"><span
id="ix.iii-p3.1"></span>I have</span> come to ask first of all for some
fruit in return for the words lately said out of brotherly love to you.
For we do not speak in order that ye should hear simply, but in order
that ye should remember what has been said, and may afford us evidence
of this, by your works. Yea, rather, not us, but, God, who knows the
secrets of the heart. On this account indeed instruction is so called,
in order that even when we are absent, our discourse may instruct your
hearts. <span id="fr_518"></span>[519](#fn_518.md) And be not surprised if,
after an interval of ten days only, we have come asking for fruit from
the seed sown. For in one day it is possible at once to let the seed
fall, and to accomplish the harvest. For strengthened not by our own
power alone, but by the influence which comes from God, we are summoned
to the conflict. Let as many therefore as have received what has been
spoken, and have fulfilled it by their works, remain reaching forth to
the things which are before. But let as many as have not yet arrived at
this good achievement, arrive at it straightway, that they may dispel
the condemnation which arises out of their sloth by their diligence for
the future. For it is possible, it is indeed possible for him who has
been very slothful, by using diligence for the future to recover the
whole loss of the time that is past. Wherefore, He says, “To-day if ye
will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the day of
provocation.” <span id="fr_519"></span>[520](#fn_519.md) And this, He says,
exhorting and counselling us; that we should never despair, but so long
as we are here, should have good hopes, and should lay hold on what is
before us, and hasten towards the prize of our high calling of God. This
then let us do, and let us inquire into the names of this great gift.
For as ignorance of the greatness of this dignity makes those who are
honored with it more slothful, so when it is known it renders them
thankful, and makes them more earnest; and anyhow it would be
disgraceful and ridiculous that they who enjoy such glory and honors
from God, should not even know what the names of it are intended to show
forth. And why do I speak about this gift, for if thou wilt consider the
common name of our race, thou wilt receive the greatest instruction and
incentive to virtue. For this name “Man,” we do not define according as
they who are without define it, but as the Divine Scripture has bidden
us. For a man is not merely whosoever has hands and feet of a man, nor
whosoever is rational only, but whosoever practices piety and virtue
with boldness. Hear, at least, what he says concerning Job. For in
saying that “there was a man in the land of Ausis,” <span
id="fr_520"></span>[521](#fn_520.md) he does not describe him in those
terms in which they who are without describe him, nor does he say this
because he had two feet and broad nails, but he added the evidences of
his piety and said, “just, true, fearing God, eschewing every evil
deed,” <span id="fr_521"></span>[522](#fn_521.md) showing that this is a
man; even as therefore another says, “Fear God, and keep his
commandments, because this is the whole man.” <span
id="fr_522"></span>[523](#fn_522.md) But if the name man affords such a
great incentive to virtue, much rather the term faithful. For thou art
called faithful on this account, because thou hast faith in God, and
thyself art entrusted from Him with righteousness, sanctification,
cleansing of soul, adoption, the kingdom of heaven. He entrusted thee
with these, and handed them over to thee. Thou in turn hast entrusted,
and handed over other things to him, almsgiving, prayers, self-control
and every other virtue. And why do I say almsgiving? If thou givest him
even a cup of cold water, thou shalt not indeed lose this, but even this
he keeps with care against that day, and will restore it with
overflowing abundance. For this truly is wonderful, that he does not
keep only that which has been entrusted to him, but in recompensing it
increases it.

<span id="ix.iii-p9"></span>This too he has bidden thee do according to
thy power, with what has been entrusted to thee, to extend the holiness
which thou hast received, and to make the righteousness which comes from
the laver brighter, and the gift of grace more radiant; even as
therefore Paul did, increasing all the good things which he <span
id="page_166">p. 166</span> <span id="ix.iii-Page_166"></span>received
by his subsequent labors, and his zeal, and his diligence. And look at
the carefulness of God; neither did he give the whole to thee then, nor
withhold the whole, but gave part, and promised part. And for what
reason did he not give the whole then? In order that thou mightest show
thy faith about Him, believing, on his promise alone, in what was not
yet given. And for what reason again did he not there dispense the
whole, but did give the grace of the Spirit, and righteousness and
sanctification? In order that he might lighten thy labors for thee, and
by what has been already given may also put thee in good hope for that
which is to come. On this account, too, thou art about to be called
newly-enlightened, because thy light is ever new, if thou wilt, and is
never quenched. For this light of day, whether we will or no, the night
succeeds, but darkness knows not that light’s ray. “For the light
shineth in the darkness, and the darkness apprehended it not.” <span
id="fr_523"></span>[524](#fn_523.md) Not so bright at least is the world,
when the sunbeams come forth, as the soul shines and becomes brighter
when it has received grace from the Spirit and learns more exactly the
nature of the case. For when night prevails, and there is darkness,
often a man has seen a coil of rope and has thought it was a serpent,
and has fled from an approaching friend as from an enemy, and being
aware of some noise, has become very much alarmed; but when the day has
come, nothing of this sort could happen, but all appears just as it
really is; which thing also occurs in the case of our soul. For when
grace has come, and driven away the darkness of the understanding, we
learn the exact nature of things, and what was before dreadful to us
becomes contemptible. For we no longer fear death, after learning
exactly, from this sacred initiation, that death is not death, but a
sleep and a seasonable slumber; nor poverty nor disease, nor any other
such thing, knowing that we are on our way to a better life, undefiled
and incorruptible, and free from all such vicissitudes.

<span id="ix.iii-p11"></span>2. Let us not therefore remain craving
after the things of this life, neither after the luxury of the table, or
costliness of raiment. For thou hast the most excellent of raiment, thou
hast a spiritual table thou hast the glory from on high, and Christ is
become to thee all things, thy table, thy raiment, thy home, thy head,
thy stem. “For as many of you as were baptized into Christ, did put on
Christ.” <span id="fr_524"></span>[525](#fn_524.md) See how he has become
raiment for thee. Dost thou wish to learn how he becomes a table for
thee? “He who eateth me,” says He, “as I live because of the Father, he
also shall live because of me;” <span id="fr_525"></span>[526](#fn_525.md)
and that he becometh a home for thee, “he that eateth my flesh abideth
in me, and I in him;” <span id="fr_526"></span>[527](#fn_526.md) and that
He is stem He says again, “I am the vine, ye the branches,” <span
id="fr_527"></span>[528](#fn_527.md) and that he is brother, and friend,
and bride-groom, “I no longer call you servants: for ye are my
friends;” <span id="fr_528"></span>[529](#fn_528.md) and Paul again, “I
espoused you to one husband, that I might present you as a pure virgin
to Christ;” <span id="fr_529"></span>[530](#fn_529.md) and again, “That he
might be the first-born among many brethren;” <span
id="fr_530"></span>[531](#fn_530.md) and we become not his brethren only,
but also his children, “For behold,” he says, “I and the children which
God has given me” <span id="fr_531"></span>[532](#fn_531.md) and not this
only, but His members, and His body. For as if what has been said were
not enough to show forth the love and the good will which He has shown
forth towards us, He has added another thing greater and nearer still,
calling himself besides, our head. Knowing all these matters, beloved,
requite thy benefactor by the best conversation, and considering the
greatness of the sacrifice, adorn the members of thy body; consider what
thou receivest in thine hand, and never suffer it to strike any one, nor
shame what has been honored with so great a gift by the sin of a blow.
Consider what thou receivest in thine hand, and keep it clean from all
covetousness and extortion; think that thou dost not receive this in thy
hand, but also puttest it to thy mouth, and guard thy tongue in purity
from base and insolent words, blasphemy, perjury, and all other such
things. For it is disastrous that what is ministered to by such most
dread mysteries, and has been dyed red with such blood, and has become a
golden sword, should be perverted to purposes of raillery, and insult,
and buffoonery. Reverence the honor with which God has honoured it, and
bring it not down to the vileness of sin, but having reflected again
that after the hand and the tongue, the heart receives this dread
mystery, do not ever weave a plot against thy neighbor, but keep thy
thoughts pure from all evil. Thus thou shalt be able to keep thine eyes
too, and thy hearing safe. For is it not monstrous, after this mystic
voice is borne from heaven—I mean the voice of the Cherubim—to defile
thy hearing with lewd songs, and dissolute melodies? and does it not
deserve the utmost punishment if, with the same eyes with which thou
lookest upon the unspeakable and dread mysteries, thou lookest upon
harlots, and dost commit adultery in thy heart. Thou art called to a
marriage, beloved: enter not in clad in sordid raiment, but take a robe
suitable to the <span id="page_167">p. 167</span> <span
id="ix.iii-Page_167"></span>marriage. For if when men are called to a
material marriage, though they be poorer than all others, they often
possess themselves of or buy clean raiment, and so go to meet those who
called them. Do thou too who hast been called to a spiritual marriage,
and to a royal banquet, consider what kind of raiment it would be right
for thee to buy, but rather there is not even need to purchase, yea he
himself who calls thee gives it thee gratis, in order that thou mayest
not be able to plead poverty in excuse. Keep, therefore, the raiment
which thou receivedst. For if thou losest it, thou wilt not be able to
use it henceforth, or to buy it. For this kind of raiment is nowhere
sold. Hast thou heard how those who were initiated, in old time,
groaned, and beat their breasts, their conscience thereupon exciting
them? Beware then, beloved, that thou do not at any time suffer like
this. But how wilt thou not suffer, if thou dost not cast off the wicked
habit of evil men? For this reason I said before, and speak now and will
not cease speaking, if any has not rectified the defects in his morals,
nor furnished himself with easily acquired virtue, let him not be
baptized. For the laver is able to remit former sins, but there is no
little fear, and no ordinary danger lest we return to them, and our
remedy become a wound. For by how much greater the grace is, by so much
is the punishment more for those who sin after these things.

<span id="ix.iii-p20"></span>3. In order, therefore, that we return not
to our former vomit, let us henceforward discipline ourselves. For that
we must repent beforehand, and desist from our former evil, and so come
forward for grace, hear what John says, and what the leader of the
apostles says to those who are about to be baptized. For the one says,
“Bring forth fruit worthy of repentance, and begin not to say within
yourselves, we have Abraham to our Father;” <span
id="fr_532"></span>[533](#fn_532.md) and the other says again to those who
question him, “Repent ye and be baptized every one of you in the name of
the Lord Jesus Christ.” <span id="fr_533"></span>[534](#fn_533.md) Now he
who repents, no longer touches the same matters of which he repented. On
this account, also, we are bidden to say, “I renounce thee, Satan,” in
order that we may never more return to him. <span
id="fr_534"></span>[535](#fn_534.md) As therefore happens in the case of
painters from life, so let it happen in your case. For they, arranging
their boards, and tracing white lines upon them, and sketching the royal
likeness in outline, before they apply the actual colors, rub out some
lines, and change some for others, rectifying mistakes, and altering
what is amiss with all freedom. But when they put on the coloring for
good, it is no longer in their power to rub out again, and to change one
thing for another, since they injure the beauty of the portrait, and the
result becomes an eyesore. Consider that thy soul is the portrait;
before therefore the true coloring of the spirit comes, wipe out habits
which have wrongly been implanted in thee, whether swearing, or
falsehood, or insolence, or base talking, or jesting, or whatever else
thou hast a habit of doing of things unlawful. Away with the habit, in
order that thou mayest not return to it, after baptism. The laver causes
the sins to disappear. Correct thy habits, so that when the colors are
applied, and the royal likeness is brought out, thou mayest no more wipe
them out in the future; and add damage and scars to the beauty which has
been given thee by God. <span id="fr_535"></span>[536](#fn_535.md) Restrain
therefore anger, extinguish passion. Be not thou vexed, be sympathizing,
be not exasperated, nor say, “I have been injured in regard to my soul.”
No one is injured in regard to the soul if we do not injure ourselves in
regard to the soul; and how this is, I now say. Has any one taken away
thy substance? He has not injured thee in regard to thy soul, but thy
money. But if thou cherish ill-will against him, thou hast injured
thyself in regard to thy soul. For the money taken away has wrought thee
no damage, nay has even been profitable, but thou by not dismissing
thine anger wilt give account in the other world for this cherishing of
ill-will. Has any one reviled thee and insulted thee. He has in no way
injured thy soul, and not even thy body. Hast thou reviled in return and
insulted? Thou hast injured thyself in regard to thy soul, for for the
words which thou hast said thou art about to render account there; and
this I wish you to know chiefly of all, that the Christian, and faithful
man, no one is able to injure in regard to the soul, not even the devil
himself; and not only is this wonderful, that God hath made us
inaccessible to all his designs, but that he has constituted us fit for
the practice of virtue, and there is no hinderance, if we will, even
though we be poor, weak in body, outcast, nameless, bondservants. For
neither poverty, nor infirmity, nor deformity of body, nor servitude,
nor any other of such things could ever become a hinderance to virtue;
and why do I say, poor, and a bondservant, <span id="page_168">p.
168</span> <span id="ix.iii-Page_168"></span>and nameless? Even if thou
art a prisoner, not even this would be ever any hinderance to thee as
regards virtue. And how this is I proceed to say. Has any of thy
household grieved thee and provoked thee? dismiss thy wrath against him.
Have bonds, and poverty, and obscurity been any hinderance to thee in
this respect? and why do I say hinderance? They have both helped and
contributed to restrain pride. Hast thou seen another prospering? do not
envy him. For not even in this case is poverty a bar. Again, whenever
thou needest to pray, do so with a sober and watchful mind, and nothing
shall be a bar even in that case. Show all meekness, forbearance,
self-restraint, gravity. For these things need no external helps. And
this especially is the chief point about virtue, that it has no
necessity for wealth, power, glory, nor anything of that kind, but of a
sanctified soul alone, and it seeks for nothing more. And behold, also,
the same thing happening in respect of grace. For if any one be lame, if
he has had his eyes put out, if he be maimed in body, if he has fallen
into the last extremity of weakness, grace is not hindered from coming
by any of these things. For it only seeks a soul receiving it with
readiness, and all these external things it passes over. For in the case
of worldly soldiers, those who are about to enlist them for the army
seek for stature of body and healthy condition, and it is not only
necessary that he who is about to become a soldier should have these
alone, but he must also be free. For if anybody be a slave, he is
rejected. But the King of Heaven seeks for nothing of this kind, but
receives slaves into his army, and aged people, and the languid in limb,
and is not ashamed. What is more merciful than this? What could be more
kind? For he seeks for what is in our own power, but they seek for what
is not in our power. For to be a slave or free is not our doing. To be
tall, again, or short is not in our own power, or to be aged, or well
grown, and such like. But to be forbearing and kind, and so forth, are
matters of our own choice; and God demands of us only those things of
which we have control. And quite reasonably. For He does not call us to
grace because of his own need, but because of doing us kindness; but
kings, because of services required by them; and they carry men off to
an outward and material warfare, but He to a spiritual combat; and it is
not only in the case of heathen wars, but in the case of the games also
that one may see the same analogy. For they who are about to be brought
into the theatre, do not descend to the contest until the herald himself
takes them beneath the gaze of all, and leads them round, shouting out
and saying, “Has any one a charge against this person?” although in that
case the struggle is not concerned with the soul, but with the body.
Wherefore then dost thou demand proofs of nobleness? But in this case
there is nothing of the kind, but all is different, our contest not
consisting of hand locked in hand, but in philosophy of soul, and
excellence of mind. The president of our conflicts does the opposite.
For he does not take us, and lead us round and say, “Has any one a
charge against this man?” but cries out, “Though all men, though demons,
stand up with the devil and accuse him of extreme and unspeakable
crimes, I reject him not, nor abhor him, but removing him from his
accusers, and freeing him from his wickedness, thus I bring him to the
contest. And this is very reasonable. For there indeed the president
contributes nothing towards the victory, in the case of the combatants,
but stands still in the midst. But here, the President of the contests
for holiness becomes a fellow-combatant, and helper, sharing with them
the conflict against the devil.

<span id="ix.iii-p25"></span>4. And not only is this the wonderful thing
that he remits our sins, but that he not even reveals them nor makes
them manifest and patent, nor compels us to come forward into the midst,
and to tell out our errors, but bids us make our defense to him alone,
and to confess ourselves to him. And yet among secular judges, if any
tell any of the robbers or grave-riflers, when they are arrested, to
tell their errors and be quit of their punishment, they would accede to
this with all readiness, despising the shame through desire of safety.
But in this case there is nothing of this kind, but he both remits the
sins, nor compels us to marshal them in array before any spectators. But
one thing alone he seeks, that he who enjoys this remission should learn
the greatness of the gift. How is it not, therefore, absurd that in case
where he does us service, he should be content with our testimony only,
but in those where we serve him we seek for others as witnesses, and do
a thing for ostentation’s sake? While we wonder then at his kindliness,
let us show forth our doings, and before all others let us curb the
vehemence of our tongue, and not always be giving utterance. “For in the
multitude of words there wanteth not transgression.” <span
id="fr_536"></span>[537](#fn_536.md) If indeed then thou hast anything
useful to say, open thy lips. But if there be nothing necessary for thee
to say, be silent, for it is better. Art thou a handicraftsman? as thou
sittest at work, sing psalms. Dost thou not wish to sing with thy mouth?
do this in thine heart; a psalm is a great com<span id="page_169">p.
169</span> <span id="ix.iii-Page_169"></span>panion. In this case thou
shalt undergo nothing serious, but shalt be able to sit in thy workshop
as in a monastery. For not suitableness of place, but strictness of
morals will afford us quiet. Paul, at least, pursuing his trade in a
workshop suffered no injury to his own virtue. <span
id="fr_537"></span>[538](#fn_537.md) Do not thou therefore say, How can I,
being a handicraftsman and a poor man, be a philosopher? This is indeed
the very reason why thou mayest be a philosopher. For poverty is far
more conducive to piety for us than wealth, and work than idleness;
since wealth is even a hinderance to those who do not take heed. For
when it is needful to dismiss anger, to extinguish envy, to curb
passion, to offer prayer, to exhibit forbearance and meekness,
kindliness and charity, when would poverty be a bar? For it is not
possible by spending money to accomplish these things, but by exhibiting
a right disposition; almsgiving especially needs money, but even it
shines forth in greater degree through poverty. For she who spent the
two mites was poorer than all men, and yet surpassed all. <span
id="fr_538"></span>[539](#fn_538.md) Let us not then consider wealth to be
anything great, nor gold to be better than clay. For the value of
material things is not owing to their nature, but to our estimate of
them. For if any one would inquire carefully, iron is much more
necessary than gold. For the one contributes to no need of our life, but
the other has furnished us with the greater part of our needs,
ministering to countless arts; and why do I speak of a comparison
between gold and iron? For these stones <span
id="fr_539"></span>[540](#fn_539.md) are more necessary than precious
stones. For of those nothing serviceable could be made, but out of
these, houses and walls and cities are erected. But do thou show me what
gain could be derived from these pearls, rather what harm would not
happen? For in order that thou mayest wear one pearl drop, countless
poor people are pinched with hunger. What excuse wilt thou hit upon?
what pardon?

<span id="ix.iii-p30"></span>Dost thou wish to adorn thy face? Do so not
with pearls, but with modesty, and dignity. So thy countenance will be
more full of grace in the eyes of thy husband. For the other kind of
adorning is wont to plunge him into a suspicion of jealousy, and into
enmity, quarrelsomeness and strife, for nothing is more annoying than a
face which is suspected. But the ornament of compassion and modesty
casts out all evil suspicion, and will draw thy partner to thee more
strongly than any bond. For natural beauty does not impart such
comeliness to the face as does the disposition of him who beholds it,
and nothing is so wont to produce that disposition as modesty and
dignity; so that if any woman be comely, and her husband be ill affected
towards her, she appears to him the most worthless of all women; and if
she do not happen to be fair of face, but her husband be well affected
towards her, she appears more comely than all. For sentence is given not
according to the nature of what is beheld, but according to the
disposition of the beholders. Adorn thy face then with modesty, dignity,
pity, lovingkindness, charity, affection for thy husband, forbearance,
meekness, endurance of ill. These are the tints of virtue. By means of
these thou wilt attract angels not human beings to be thy lovers. By
means of these thou hast God to commend thee, and when God receives
thee, he will certainly win over thy husband for thee. For if the wisdom
of a man illuminates his countenance, <span
id="fr_540"></span>[541](#fn_540.md) much more does the virtue of a woman
illuminate her face; and if thou considerest this to be a great
ornament, tell me what will be the advantage of the pearls in that day?
But why is it necessary to speak of that day, since it is possible to
show all this from what happens now. When, then, they who thought fit to
revile the emperor were dragged to the judgment hall, and were in danger
of extreme measures being taken, then the mothers, and the wives, laying
aside their necklaces, and their golden ornaments, and pearls, and all
adornment, and golden raiment, wearing a simple and mean dress, and
besprinkled with ashes, prostrated themselves before the doors of the
judgment hall and thus won over the judges; and if in the case of these
earthly courts of justice, the golden ornaments, and the pearls, and the
variegated dress would have been a snare and a betrayal, but
forbearance, and meekness, and ashes, and tears, and mean garments
persuaded the judge, much more would this take place in the case of that
impartial and dread tribunal. For what reason wilt thou be able to
state, what defense, when the Master lays these pearls to thy charge,
and brings the poor who have perished with hunger into the midst? On
this account Paul said, “not with braided hair, or gold, or pearls, or
costly raiment.” <span id="fr_541"></span>[542](#fn_541.md) For therein
would be a snare. And if we were to enjoy them continually, yet we shall
lay them aside with death. But arising out of virtue there is all
security, and no vicissitude and changeableness, but here it makes us
more secure, and also accompanies us there. Dost thou wish to possess
pearls, and never to lay aside this wealth? Take off all ornament and
place it in the hands <span id="page_170">p. 170</span> <span
id="ix.iii-Page_170"></span>of Christ through the poor. He will keep all
thy wealth for thee, when He shall raise up thy body with much radiancy.
Then He shall invest thee with better wealth and greater ornament, since
this present is mean and absurd. Consider then whom thou wishest to
please, and for whose sake thou puttest on this ornament, not in order
that the ropemaker and the coppersmith and the huckster may admire. Then
art thou not ashamed, nor blushest thou when thou showest thyself to
them? doing all on their account whom thou dost not consider worthy of
accosting.

<span id="ix.iii-p33"></span>How then wilt thou laugh this fancy to
scorn? If thou wilt remember that word, which thou sentest forth when
thou wert initiated, I renounce thee, Satan, and thy pomp, and thy
service. For the frenzy about pearls is a pomp of Satan. For thou didst
receive gold not in order that thou mightest bind it on to thy body, but
in order that thou mightest release and nourish the poor. Say therefore
constantly, I renounce thee, Satan. Nothing is more safe than this word
if we shall prove it by our deeds.

<span id="ix.iii-p34"></span>5. This I think it right that you who are
about to be initiated should learn. For this word is a covenant with the
Master. And just as we, when we buy slaves, first ask those who are
being sold if they are willing to be our servants: So also does Christ.
When He is about to receive thee into service, He first asks if thou
wishest to leave that cruel and relentless tyrant, and He receives
covenants from thee. For his service is not forced upon thee. And see
the lovingkindness of God. For we, before we put down the price, ask
those who are being sold, and when we have learned that they are
willing, then we put down the price. But Christ not so, but He even put
down the price for us all; his precious blood. For, He says, ye were
bought with a price. <span id="fr_542"></span>[543](#fn_542.md)
Notwithstanding, not even then does He compel those who are unwilling,
to serve him; but except thou hast grace, He says, and of thine own
accord and will determinest to enroll thyself under my rule, I do not
compel, nor force thee. And *we* should not have chosen to buy wicked
slaves. But if we should at any time have so chosen, we buy them with a
perverted choice, and put down a corresponding price for them. But
Christ, buying ungrateful and lawless slaves, put down the price of a
servant of first quality, nay rather much more, and so much greater that
neither speech nor thought can set forth its greatness. For neither
giving heaven, nor earth, nor sea, but giving up that which is more
valuable than all these, his own blood, thus He bought us. And after all
these things, he does not require of us witnesses, or registration, but
is content with the single word, if thou sayest it from thy heart. “I
renounce thee, Satan, and thy pomp,” has included all. Let us then say
this, “I renounce thee, Satan,” as men who are about in that world at
that day to have that word demanded of them, and let us keep it in order
that we may then return this deposit safe. But Satan’s pomps are
theatres, and the circus, and all sin, and observance of days, and
incantations and omens.

<span id="ix.iii-p36"></span>“And what are omens?” says one. Often when
going forth from his own house he has seen a one-eyed or lame man, and
has shunned him as an omen. This is a pomp of Satan. For meeting the man
does not make the day turn out ill, but to live in sin. When thou goest
forth, then, beware of one thing—that sin does not meet thee. For this
it is which trips us up. And without this the devil will be able to do
us no harm. What sayest thou? Thou seest a man, and shunnest him as an
omen, and dost not see the snare of the devil, how he sets thee at war
with him who has done thee no wrong, how he makes thee the enemy of thy
brother on no just pretext; but God has bidden us love our enemies; but
thou art turned away from him who did thee no wrong, having nothing to
charge him with, and dost thou not consider how great is the absurdity,
how great the shame, rather how great is the danger? Can I speak of
anything more absurd? I am ashamed, indeed, and I blush: But for your
salvation’s sake, I am, I am compelled to speak of it. If a virgin meet
him he says the day becomes unsuccessful; but if a harlot meet him, it
is propitious, and profitable, and full of much business; are you
ashamed? and do you smite your foreheads, and bend to the ground? But do
not this on account of the words which I have spoken, but of the deeds
which have been done. See then, in this case, how the devil hid his
snare, in order that we might turn away from the modest, but salute and
be friendly to the unchaste. For since he has heard Christ saying that
“He who looketh on a woman to desire her, has already committed adultery
with her,” <span id="fr_543"></span>[544](#fn_543.md) and has seen many get
the better of unchastity, wishing by another wrong to cast them again
into sin, by this superstitious observance he gladly persuades them to
pay attention to whorish women.

<span id="ix.iii-p38"></span>And what is one to say about them who use
charms and amulets, and encircle their heads and feet with golden coins
of Alexander <span id="page_171">p. 171</span> <span
id="ix.iii-Page_171"></span>of Macedon. Are these our hopes, tell me,
that after the cross and death of our Master, we should place our hopes
of salvation on an image of a Greek king? Dost thou not know what great
result the cross has achieved? It has abolished death, has extinguished
sin, has made Hades useless, has undone the power of the devil, and is
it not worth trusting for the health of the body? It has raised up the
whole world, and dost thou not take courage in it? And what wouldest
thou be worthy to suffer, tell me? Thou dost not only have amulets
always with thee, but incantations bringing drunken and half-witted old
women into thine house, and art thou not ashamed, and dost thou not
blush, after so great philosophy, to be terrified at such things? and
there is a graver thing than this error. For when we deliver these
exhortations, and lead them away, thinking that they defend themselves,
they say, that the woman is a Christian who makes these incantations,
and utters nothing else than the name of God. On this account I
especially hate and turn away from her, because she makes use of the
name of God, with a view to ribaldry. For even the demons uttered the
name of God, but still they were demons, and thus they used to say to
Christ, “We know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God,” <span
id="fr_544"></span>[545](#fn_544.md) and notwithstanding, he rebuked them,
and drave them away. On this account, then, I beseech you to cleanse
yourselves from this error, and to keep hold of this word as a staff;
and just as without sandals, and cloak, no one of you would choose to go
down to the market-place, so without this word never enter the
market-place, but when thou art about to pass over the threshold of the
gateway, say this word first: I leave thy ranks, Satan, and thy pomp,
and thy service, and I join the ranks of Christ. And never go forth
without this word. This shall be a staff to thee, this thine armor, this
an impregnable fortress, and accompany this word with the sign of the
cross on thy forehead. For thus not only a man who meets you, but even
the devil himself, will be unable to hurt you at all, when he sees thee
everywhere appearing with these weapons; and discipline thyself by these
means henceforth, in order that when thou receivest the seal <span
id="fr_545"></span>[546](#fn_545.md) thou mayest be a well-equipped
soldier, and planting thy trophy against the devil, may receive the
crown of righteousness, which may it be the lot of us all to obtain,
through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, with whom
be glory to the Father and to the Holy Spirit for ever and ever—Amen.

<span id="ix.iii-p4"></span> Catechism, or oral instruction,
“Catechesis,” in Greek is called by that name. Chrysostom says, a word
derived from ἠχἠ, a sound, in order that it may “resound” in your minds
ἐνηχῆ. It is impossible to preserve the play upon words in the
translation consistently with an exact rendering.

<span id="ix.iii-p23"></span> Alluding to the vow of renunciation made
by converts at baptism. A specimen of this vow may be read in the
so-called Apostolic Constitutions, vii. c. 42. “I renounce Satan and his
works, and his pomps, and his service, and his angels, and his
inventions, and all things that belong or are subject to him.” This vow
of renunciation was uttered by the catechumens in the porch or
ante-chamber of the baptistery with outstretched hands, and faces turned
westwards. See below in Chapter V.
