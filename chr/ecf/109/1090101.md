<span id="xix.x-p1"></span> <span class="c17"><span
id="xix.x-p1.1"></span>Homily VIII.</span>

<span id="xix.x-p2"></span>An exhortation to virtue—and particularly
upon the passage, “God was walking in Paradise in the cool of the
day:”—and again on the subject of abstaining from oaths.

<span id="xix.x-p3"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="xix.x-p3.1"></span>Ye</span> have lately heard, how all Scripture
bringeth consolation and comfort, although it be an historical
narrative. For instance, “In the beginning, God created the heaven and
the earth,” <span id="fr_1365"></span>[1366](#fn_1365.md) was an historical
declaration; but it was shewn in our discourse, that this sentence was
one pregnant with comfort; as, for example, that God made us a twofold
table, <span id="fr_1366"></span>[1367](#fn_1366.md) by spreading out the
sea and the land at the same time; by kindling above the twofold lights,
the sun and moon; by determining the twofold seasons of their course,
the day and night, the one for labour, and the other for rest. For the
night ministers to us no less benefit than the day. But as I said with
reference to trees, those which are barren, rival in their utility those
which bear fruit; since we are thus not necessitated to touch those
trees which are pleasant for food, for the purposes of building. The
wild and untamed animals are also subservient to our need, in no less a
degree than the tame animals; by driving us together, through the fear
of them, into cities; making us more cautious, and binding us to one
another; and by exercising the strength of some, and freeing others from
their sicknesses; for the physicians concoct many medicines out of
these; <span id="fr_1367"></span>[1368](#fn_1367.md) and by reminding us of
our ancient sin. For when I hear it said, “The fear of you, and the
dread of you, shall be upon all the wild beasts of the earth:” <span
id="fr_1368"></span>[1369](#fn_1368.md) and then observe, that this honour
was afterwards curtailed, I am reminded of sin, which hath dissipated
the fear of us, and undermined our authority. Thus I become a better and
a wiser <span id="fr_1369"></span>[1370](#fn_1369.md) man, whilst I learn
the harm that sin hath occasioned us. As then, what I said was, that the
things alluded to, and others of a similar kind, which God, who is the
Maker, knoweth of, contribute not a little to our present life; so now
also I say, that the night no less than the day brings along with it its
advantage, being a rest from labours, and a medicine for disease. Often,
indeed, physicians, though exerting themselves in many ways, and
preparing an endless variety of remedies, are not able to deliver the
man who is labouring under infirmity. But sleep coming upon him of its
own accord hath entirely removed the disease, and freed them <span
id="fr_1370"></span>[1371](#fn_1370.md) from an infinite deal of trouble.
Night, again, is not only a medicine for bodily labours, but also for
mental diseases, in giving rest to anguished souls. Ofttimes it
happeneth that some one hath lost a son; <span
id="fr_1371"></span>[1372](#fn_1371.md) and comforters without number have
been of no avail to withdraw him from tears and groans. But on the
approach of night, conquered by the despotic power <span
id="fr_1372"></span>[1373](#fn_1372.md) of sleep, he hath closed his
eyelids in slumber, and received some small relief from the miseries of
the day time.

<span id="xix.x-p17"></span>2. And now, I pray you, let us proceed to
the subject which hath given rise to these observations. For well I
know, that ye are all eagerly awaiting this matter; and that each one of
you is in pain till he learn on what account this Book was not given
from the beginning. But even now I do not see that the <span
id="page_396">p. 396</span> <span id="xix.x-Page_396"></span>time is fit
for a discourse on this subject. And why so? Because the week hath
nearly arrived at its close with us, and I fear to touch upon a subject,
the exposition of which I should presently afterwards be obliged to cut
short. For the subject requires of us several days in succession, and a
continuous effort of memory: wherefore we must again defer it. <span
id="fr_1373"></span>[1374](#fn_1373.md) But take it not amiss! we will
assuredly pay you the debt with interest; for thus it is expedient both
for you, and for us who are to discharge it. Meanwhile, however, let us
now speak on that subject which we left out yesterday. And what was it
we left out yesterday? “God was walking,” it says, “in Paradise in the
cool of the day.” <span id="fr_1374"></span>[1375](#fn_1374.md) What is
here meant, I ask? “God was walking!” God was not walking; for how
should He do this who is everywhere present and filleth all things? But
He caused a perception of this sort in Adam, in order that he might
collect <span id="fr_1375"></span>[1376](#fn_1375.md) himself; that he
might not be careless; that in flying and in hiding himself, he might
present beforehand some portion of the excuse, even before any words had
passed. For even as those who are about to be led to the tribunal, to
sustain the charges respecting the crimes they have committed, present
themselves before those who are to try them with a squalid, begrimed,
sad, and subdued visage, in order that from their appearance, they may
incline them to loving-kindness, mercy, and forgiveness, so also did it
happen in the case of Adam. For it was necessary that he should be led
to this Tribunal in a subdued state. Therefore God took him beforehand,
and humbled him. But that some one was walking there, he perceived; but
whence came he to suppose that God was walking there? Such is the
habitual custom of those who have committed sin. They are suspicious of
all things; they tremble at shadows; they are in terror at every sound,
and they imagine that every one is approaching them in a hostile manner.
Often therefore the guilty, when they observe people running on another
business, suppose that they are come against them; and when others are
conversing one with another on quite a different subject, they that are
conscious of sin suppose they are conversing about them.

<span id="xix.x-p21"></span>3. For such is the nature of sin, that it
betrays whilst no one finds fault; it condemns whilst no one accuses; it
makes the sinner a timid being; one that trembles at a sound; even as
righteousness has the contrary effect. Hear, at least, how the Scripture
describes this cowardice of the former, and this boldness of the latter.
“The wicked flee when no man pursueth.” <span
id="fr_1376"></span>[1377](#fn_1376.md) How doth he flee when no man
pursueth? He hath that within which drives him on—an accuser in his
conscience; and this he carries about everywhere; and just as it would
be impossible to flee from himself, so neither can he escape the
persecutor within; but wherever he goeth, <span
id="fr_1377"></span>[1378](#fn_1377.md) he is scourged, and hath an
incurable wound! But not such is the righteous man. Of what nature then
is he? Hear: “The righteous is bold as a lion!” Such a man was Elias. He
saw, for instance, the king coming towards him, and when he said, “Why
is it that thou pervertest Israel?” <span
id="fr_1378"></span>[1379](#fn_1378.md) he answered, “I pervert not Israel,
but thou and thy father’s house.” <span
id="fr_1379"></span>[1380](#fn_1379.md) Truly, the just man is bold as a
lion; for he stood up against the king just as a lion doth against some
vile cur. Although the one had the purple, the other had the sheepskin,
which was the more venerable garment of the two; for that purple brought
forth the grievous famine; but this sheepskin effected a liberation from
that calamity! It divided the Jordan! It made Elisha a two-fold <span
id="fr_1380"></span>[1381](#fn_1380.md) Elias! O how great is the virtue of
the Saints! Not only their words; not only their bodies, but even their
very garments are always esteemed venerable by the whole creation. The
sheepskin of this man divided the Jordan! the sandals of the Three
Children trampled down the fire! The word of Elisha changed the waters,
so that it made them to bear the iron on their surface! The rod of Moses
divided the Red Sea and cleft <span id="fr_1381"></span>[1382](#fn_1381.md)
the rock! The garments of Paul expelled diseases! The shadow of Peter
put death to flight! The ashes of the holy Martyrs <span
id="fr_1382"></span>[1383](#fn_1382.md) drive away demons! For this reason
they do all things with authority, even as Elias did. For he looked not
on the diadem, nor the outward pomp <span
id="fr_1383"></span>[1384](#fn_1383.md) of the king, but he looked on the
soul clad in rags, squalid, begrimed, and in a more wretched condition
than that of any criminal; and seeing him the captive and slave of his
passions, he despised his power. For he seemed to see a king but in a
scene, <span id="page_397">p. 397</span> <span
id="xix.x-Page_397"></span>and not a real one. For what was the
advantage of outward abundance, when the poverty within was so great?
And what harm could outward poverty do, when there was such a treasure
of wealth within? Such a lion also was the blessed Paul; for when he had
entered into the prison, and only raised his voice, he shook all the
foundations; he gnawed in pieces <span
id="fr_1384"></span>[1385](#fn_1384.md) the fetters, employing not his
teeth, but words; on which account it were fitting to call such men not
merely lions, but something more than lions; for a lion ofttimes, after
he hath fallen into a net, is taken; but the Saints when they are bound,
become still more powerful; just as this blessed man did then in the
prison, having loosed the prisoners, shaken the walls, and bound the
keeper, and overcome him by the word of godliness. The lion uttereth his
voice, and putteth all the wild beasts to flight. The Saint uttereth his
voice, and driveth away the demons on every side! The weapons of the
lion are a hairy mane, pointed claws, and sharp teeth. The weapons of
the righteous man are spiritual wisdom, temperance, patience, contempt
of all present things. Whoever hath these weapons shall not only be able
to deride wicked men, but even the adverse powers themselves.

<span id="xix.x-p31"></span>4. Study then, O man, the life according to
God, and no one shall conquer thee at any time; and although thou mayest
be accounted the most insignificant of men, thou shalt be more powerful
than all. On the other hand, if thou art indifferent about virtue of
soul, though thou wert the most powerful of men, thou wilt easily be
worsted by all that assail thee. And the examples already quoted proved
this. But if thou art desirous, I will also endeavour to teach thee by
actual facts <span id="fr_1385"></span>[1386](#fn_1385.md) the
unconquerableness of the righteous, and the vulnerable condition of
sinners. Hear then how the prophet intimates both these particulars.
“The ungodly,” saith he, “are not so, but are like the chaff which the
wind scattereth away from the face of the earth.” <span
id="fr_1386"></span>[1387](#fn_1386.md) For even as chaff lies exposed to
the gusts of wind, and is easily caught up and swept along, so is also
the sinner driven about by every temptation; for whilst he is at war
with himself, and bears the warfare about with him, what hope of safety
does he possess; betrayed as he is at home, and carrying with him that
conscience, which is a constant enemy? Such, however, is not the nature
of the righteous man. But what manner of man is he? Hear the same
prophet, saying, “They that trust in the Lord are as Mount Zion.” <span
id="fr_1387"></span>[1388](#fn_1387.md) What means then, “As Mount Zion?”
“He shall not be shaken,” saith he, “for ever.” For whatever engines
thou bringest up, whatever darts thou hurlest, desiring to overturn a
mountain, thou wilt never be able to prevail; for how canst thou? thou
wilt break in pieces all thine engines, and exhaust thine own strength.
Such also is the righteous man. Whatever blows he may receive, he
suffereth no evil therefrom; but destroyeth the power of those who take
counsel against him, and not of men only, but of demons. Thou hast heard
often what engines the Devil brought up against Job; but not only did he
fail to overthrow that mountain, but drew back exhausted, his darts
broken to pieces, and his engines rendered useless, by that assault!

<span id="xix.x-p35"></span>5. Knowing these things, let us take heed to
our life; and let us not be earnest as to the goods that perish; neither
as to the glory that goeth out; nor as to that body which groweth old;
nor as to that beauty which is fading; nor as to that pleasure which is
fleeting; but let us expend all our care about the soul; and let us
provide for the welfare of this in every way. For to cure the body, when
diseased, is not an easy matter to every one; but to cure a sick soul is
easy to all; and the sickness of the body requires medicines, as well as
money, for its healing; but the healing of the soul is a thing that is
easy to procure, and devoid of expense. And the nature of the flesh is
with much labour delivered from those wounds which are troublesome; for
very often the knife must be applied, and medicines that are bitter; but
with respect to the soul there is nothing of this kind. It suffices only
to exercise the will, and the desire, and all things are accomplished.
And this hath been the work of God’s providence. For inasmuch as from
bodily sickness no great injury could arise, (for though we were not
diseased, yet death would in any case come, and destroy and dissolve the
body); but everything depends upon the health of our souls; this being
by far the more precious and necessary, He hath made the medicining of
it easy, and void of expense or pain. What excuse therefore, or what
pardon shall we obtain, if when the body is sick, and money must be
expended on its behalf, and physicians called in, and much anguish
endured, we make this so much a matter of our care (though what might
result from that sickness could be no great <span id="page_398">p.
398</span> <span id="xix.x-Page_398"></span>injury to us), and yet treat
the soul with neglect? And this, when we are neither called upon to pay
down money; nor to give others any trouble; nor to sustain any
sufferings; but without any of all these things, by only choosing and
willing, have it in our power to accomplish the entire amendment of it;
and knowing assuredly that if we fail to do this, we shall sustain the
extreme sentence, and punishments, and penalties, which are inexorable!
For tell me, if any one promised to teach thee the healing art in a
short space of time, without money or labour, wouldest thou not think
him a benefactor? Wouldest thou not submit both to do and to suffer all
things, whatsoever he who promised these things commanded? Behold, now,
it is permitted thee without labour to find a medicine for wounds, not
of the body, but of the soul, and to restore it to a state of health,
without any suffering! Let us not be indifferent to the matter! For pray
what is the pain of laying aside anger against one who hath aggrieved
thee? It is a pain, indeed, to remember injuries, and not to be
reconciled! What labour is it to pray, and to ask for a thousand good
things from God, who is ready to give? What labour is it, not to speak
evil of any one? What difficulty is there in being delivered from envy
and ill-will? What trouble is it to love one’s neighbour? What suffering
is it not to utter shameful words, nor to revile, nor to insult another?
What fatigue is it not to swear? for again I return to this same
admonition. The labour of swearing is indeed exceedingly great.
Oftentimes, whilst under the influence of anger or wrath, we have sworn,
perhaps, that we would never be reconciled to those who have injured us.
Yet afterwards, when our wrath was quenched, and our anger allayed,
desiring to be reconciled, and restrained by the obligation of these
oaths, we have suffered the same anguish, as if we were in a snare, and
held fast by indissoluble bonds. Of which fact the Devil being aware,
and understanding clearly that anger is a fire; that it is easily
extinguished, and that when it is extinguished, then reconciliation and
love follows; wishing this fire to remain unquenched, he often binds us
by an oath; so that although the anger should cease, the obligation of
the oath remaining may keep up the fire within us; and that one of these
two things may take place, either that being reconciled we are forsworn,
or that not being reconciled we subject ourselves to the penalties of
cherishing malice.

<span id="xix.x-p36"></span>6. Knowing these things then, let us avoid
oaths; and let our mouth continually practise the saying, “Believe
me;” <span id="fr_1388"></span>[1389](#fn_1388.md) and this will be to us a
foundation for all pious behaviour; <span
id="fr_1389"></span>[1390](#fn_1389.md) for the tongue, when it has been
disciplined to use this one expression, is ashamed, and would blush to
utter words that are disgraceful and ugly; and should it at any time be
drawn away by habit, it will be checked again, by having many accusers.
For when any one observes him who is not a swearer giving utterance to
foul words, he will take his advantage over him, and ridicule, and
exclaim tauntingly, “Thou who sayest in all affairs, ‘Believe me,’ and
venturest not to utter an oath, dost thou disgrace thy tongue with these
shameful expressions?” So that being forcibly urged by those who are
with us, even if unwilling, we shall return again to a pious behaviour.
“But what,” says one, “if it be necessary to take an oath?” Where there
is a transgression of the law, there is no such thing as necessity. “Is
it possible then,” it is replied, “not to swear at all?” What sayest
thou? Hath God commanded, and darest thou to ask if it be possible for
His law to be kept? Why, truly it is a thing impossible that His law
should not be kept; and I am desirous to persuade you from present
circumstances of this; that so far from its being impossible not to
swear, it is impossible to swear. <span
id="fr_1390"></span>[1391](#fn_1390.md) For behold, the inhabitants of the
city were commanded to bring in a payment of gold, <span
id="fr_1391"></span>[1392](#fn_1391.md) such as it might have seemed beyond
the power of many to do; yet the greater part of the sum has been
collected; and you may hear the tax gatherers saying, “Why delay, man?
Why put us off from day to day? It is not possible to avoid it. It is
the law of the Emperor, which admits of no delay.” What sayest thou, I
ask? The Emperor hath commanded thee to bring in thy money, and it is
impossible not to bring it in! God hath commanded thee to avoid oaths!
and how sayest thou, it is impossible to avoid them!

<span id="xix.x-p41"></span>7. I am now for the sixth day admonishing
you in respect of this precept. Henceforth, I am desirous to take
leave <span id="fr_1392"></span>[1393](#fn_1392.md) of you, meaning to
abstain from the subject, that ye may be on your guard. There will no
longer be any excuse or allowance for you; for of right, indeed, if
nothing had been said on this matter, it ought to have been amended of
yourselves, for it is not a thing of an intricate <span id="page_399">p.
399</span> <span id="xix.x-Page_399"></span>nature, or that requires
great preparation. But since ye have enjoyed the advantage of so much
admonition and counsel, what excuse will ye have to offer, when ye stand
accused before that dread tribunal, and are required to give account of
this transgression. It is impossible to invent any excuse; but of
necessity you must either go hence amended, or, if you have not amended,
be punished, and abide the extremest penalty! Thinking, therefore, upon
all these things, and departing hence with much anxiety about them,
exhort ye one another, that the things spoken of during so many days may
be kept with all watchfulness in your minds, so that whilst we are
silent, ye instructing, edifying, exhorting one another, may exhibit
great improvement; and having fulfilled all the other precepts, may
enjoy eternal crowns; which God grant we may all obtain, through the
grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom and with whom
be glory, to the Father, together with the Holy Ghost, for ever and
ever. Amen.
