<span id="xv.iv"></span>

<span id="xv.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c17"><span
id="xv.iv-p1.1"></span>Homily II.</span>

<span id="xv.iv-p2"></span>After Eutropius having been found outside the
Church had been taken captive.

<span id="xv.iv-p3"></span>1. <span class="c12"><span
id="xv.iv-p3.1"></span>Delectable</span> indeed are the meadow, and the
garden, but far more delectable the study of the divine writings. For
there indeed are flowers which fade, but here are thoughts which abide
in full bloom; there is the breeze of the zephyr, but here the breath of
the Spirit: there is the hedge of thorns, but here is the guarding
providence of God; there is the song of cicadæ, but here the melody of
the prophets: there is the pleasure which comes from sight, but here the
profit which comes from study. The garden is confined to one place, but
the Scriptures are in all parts of the world; the garden is subject to
the necessities of the seasons, but the Scriptures are rich in foliage,
and laden with fruit alike in winter and in summer. Let us then give
diligent heed to the study of the Scriptures: for if thou doest this the
Scripture will expel thy despondency, and engender pleasure, extirpate
vice, and make virtue take root, and in the tumult of life it will save
thee from suffering like those who are tossed by troubled waves. The sea
rages but thou sailest on with calm weather; for thou hast the study of
the Scriptures for thy pilot; for this is the cable which the trials of
life do not break asunder. Now that I lie not events themselves bear
witness. A few days ago the Church was besieged: an army came, and fire
issued from their eyes, yet it did not scorch the olive tree; swords
were unsheathed, yet no one received a wound; the imperial gates were in
distress, but the Church was in security. And yet the tide of <span
id="page_253">p. 253</span> <span id="xv.iv-Page_253"></span>war flowed
hither; for here the refugee was sought, and we withstood them, not
fearing their rage. And wherefore prithee? because we held as a sure
pledge the saying “Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my
Church: and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.” <span
id="fr_814"></span>[815](#fn_814.md) And when I say the Church I mean not
only a place but also a plan of life: <span
id="fr_815"></span>[816](#fn_815.md) I mean not the walls of the Church but
the laws of the Church. When thou takest refuge in a Church, do not seek
shelter merely in the place but in the spirit of the place. For the
Church is not wall and roof but faith and life.

<span id="xv.iv-p6"></span>Do not tell me that the man having been
surrendered was surrendered by the Church; if he had not abandoned the
Church he would not have been surrendered. Do not say that he fled here
for refuge and then was given up: the Church did not abandon him but he
abandoned the Church. He was not surrendered from within the Church but
outside its walls. Wherefore did he forsake the Church? Didst thou
desire to save thyself? Thou shouldst have held fast to the altar. There
were no walls here, but there was the guarding providence of God. Wast
thou a sinner? God does not reject thee: for “He came not to call the
righteous but sinners to repentance.” <span
id="fr_816"></span>[817](#fn_816.md) The harlot was saved when she clung to
His feet. Have ye heard the passage read to-day? Now I say these things
that thou mayest not hesitate to take refuge in the Church. Abide with
the Church, and the Church does not hand thee over to the enemy: but if
thou fliest from the Church, the Church is not the cause of thy capture.
For if thou art inside the fold the wolf does not enter: but if thou
goest outside, thou art liable to be the wild beast’s prey: yet this is
not the fault of the fold, but of thy own pusillanimity. The Church hath
no feet. Talk not to me of walls and arms: for walls wax old with time,
but the Church has no old age. Walls are shattered by barbarians, but
over the Church even demons do not prevail. And that my words are no
mere vaunt there is the evidence of facts. How many have assailed the
Church, and yet the assailants have perished while the Church herself
has soared beyond the sky? Such might hath the Church: when she is
assailed she conquers: when snares are laid for her she prevails: when
she is insulted her prosperity increases: she is wounded yet sinks not
under her wounds; tossed by waves yet not submerged; vexed by storms yet
suffers no shipwreck; she wrestles and is not worsted, fights but is not
vanquished. Wherefore then did she suffer this war to be? That she might
make more manifest the splendour of her triumph. Ye were present on that
day, and ye saw what weapons were set in motion against her, and how the
rage of the soldiers burned more fiercely than fire, and I was hurried
away to the imperial palace. <span id="fr_817"></span>[818](#fn_817.md) But
what of that? By the grace of God none of those things dismayed me.

<span id="xv.iv-p9"></span>2. Now I say these things in order that ye
too may follow my example. But wherefore was I not dismayed? Because I
do not fear any present terrors. For what is terrible? Death? nay this
is not terrible: for we speedily reach the unruffled haven. Or
spoliation of goods? “Naked came I out of my mother’s womb, and naked
shall I depart;” <span id="fr_818"></span>[819](#fn_818.md) or exile? “The
earth is the Lord’s and the fulness thereof;” <span
id="fr_819"></span>[820](#fn_819.md) or false accusation? “Rejoice and be
exceeding glad, when men shall say all manner of evil against you
falsely, for great is your reward in Heaven.” <span
id="fr_820"></span>[821](#fn_820.md) I saw the swords and I meditated on
Heaven; I expected death, and I bethought me of the resurrection; I
beheld the sufferings of this lower world, and I took account of the
heavenly prizes; I observed the devices of the enemy, and I meditated on
the heavenly crown: for the occasion of the contest was sufficient for
encouragement and consolation. True! I was being forcibly dragged away,
but I suffered no insult from the act; for there is only one real
insult, namely sin: and should the whole world insult thee, yet if thou
dost not insult thyself thou art not insulted. The only real betrayal is
the betrayal of the conscience: betray not thy own conscience, and no
one can betray thee. I was being dragged away and I saw the events—or
rather I saw my words turned into events, I saw my discourse which I had
uttered in words being preached in the market-place through the medium
of actual events. What kind of discourse? the same which I was always
repeating. The wind has blown and the leaves have fallen. “The grass has
withered and the flower has faded.” <span
id="fr_821"></span>[822](#fn_821.md) The night has departed and the day has
dawned; the shadow has been proved vain and the truth has appeared. They
mounted up to the sky, and they came down to the level of earth: for the
waves which were swelling high have been laid low by means of merely
human events. How? The things which were taking place were a lesson. And
I said to myself will posterity learn self-control? or before two days
have passed by will these events have been abandoned to oblivion? The
warnings were sounding in their ears. Again let me utter, yet again I
will speak. What profit will there be? Certainly there will be profit.
For <span id="page_254">p. 254</span> <span
id="xv.iv-Page_254"></span>if all do not hearken, the half will hearken;
and if not the half, the third part: and if not the third the fourth:
and if not the fourth, perhaps ten: and if not ten, perhaps five: and if
not five perhaps one: and if not one, I myself have the reward prepared
for me. “The grass withereth and the flower fadeth; but the word of God
abideth for ever.” <span id="fr_822"></span>[823](#fn_822.md)

<span id="xv.iv-p15"></span>3. Have ye seen the insignificance of human
affairs? have ye seen the frailty of power? Have ye seen the wealth
which I always called a runaway and not a runaway only, but also a
murderer. For it not only deserts those who possess it, but also
slaughters them; for when any one pays court to it then most of all does
it betray him. Why dost thou pay court to wealth which to-day is for
thee, and to-morrow for another? Why dost thou court wealth which can
never be held fast? Dost thou desire to court it? dost thou desire to
hold it fast? Do not bury it but give it into the hands of the poor. For
wealth is a wild beast: if it be tightly held it runs away: if it be let
loose it remains where it is; “For,” it is said, “he hath dispersed
abroad and given to the poor; his righteousness remaineth
forever.” <span id="fr_823"></span>[824](#fn_823.md) Disperse it then that
it may remain with thee; bury it not lest it run away. Where is wealth?
I would gladly enquire of those who have departed. Now I say these
things not by way of reproach, God forbid, nor by way of irritating old
sores, but as endeavouring to secure a haven for you out of the
shipwreck of others. When soldiers and swords were threatening, when the
city was in a blaze of fury, when the imperial majesty was powerless,
and the purple was insulted, when all places were full of frenzy, where
was wealth then? where was your silver plate? where were your silver
couches? where your household slaves? they had all betaken themselves to
flight; where were the eunuchs? they all ran away; where were your
friends? they changed their masks. Where were your houses? they were
shut up. Where was your money? the owner of it fled: and the money
itself, where was that? it was buried. Where was it all hidden? Am I
oppressive and irksome to you in constantly declaring that wealth
betrays those who use it badly? The occasion has now come which proves
the truth of my words. Why dost thou hold it so tightly, when in the
time of trial it profiteth thee nothing? If it has power when thou
fallest into a strait, let it come to thy aid, but if it then runs away
what need hast thou of it? events themselves bear witness. What profit
was there in it? The sword was whetted, death was impending, an army
raging: there was apprehension of imminent peril; and yet wealth was
nowhere to be seen. Where did the runaway flee? It was itself the cause
which brought about all these evils, and yet in the hours of necessity
it runs away. Nevertheless many reproach me saying continually thou
fasteneth upon the rich: while they on the other hand fasten upon the
poor. Well I do fasten upon the rich: or rather not the rich, but those
who make a bad use of their riches. For I am continually saying that I
do not attack the character of the rich man, but of the rapacious. A
rich man is one thing, a rapacious man is another: an affluent man is
one thing, a covetous man is another. Make clear distinctions, and do
not confuse things which are diverse. Art thou a rich man? I forbid thee
not. Art thou a rapacious man? I denounce thee. Hast thou property of
thy own? enjoy it. Dost thou take the property of others? I will not
hold my peace. Wouldest thou stone me for this? I am ready to shed my
blood: only I forbid thy sin. I heed not hatred, I heed not war: one
thing only do I heed, the advancement of my hearers. The rich are my
children, and the poor also are my children: the same womb has travailed
with both, both are the offspring of the same travail-pangs. If then
thou fastenest reproaches on the poor man, I denounce thee: for the poor
man does not suffer so much loss as the rich. For no great wrong is
inflicted on the poor man, seeing that in his case the injury is
confined to money; but in thy case the injury touches the soul. Let him
who wills cast me off, let him who wills stone me, let him who wills
hate me: for the plots of enemies are the pledges to me of crowns of
victory, and the number of my rewards will be as the number of my
wounds.

<span id="xv.iv-p17"></span>4. So then I fear not an enemy’s plots: one
thing only do I fear, which is sin. If no one convicts me of sin, then
let the whole world make war upon me. For this kind of war only renders
me more prosperous. Thus also do I wish to teach you a lesson. Fear not
the devices of a potentate, but fear the power of sin. No man will do
thee harm, if thou dost not deal a blow to thyself. If thou hast not
sin, ten thousand swords may threaten thee, but God will snatch thee
away out of their reach: but if thou hast sin, even shouldest thou be in
paradise thou wilt be cast out. Adam was in paradise yet he fell; Job
was on a dung hill, yet he was crowned victorious. What profit was
paradise to the one? or what injury was the dung hill to the other? No
man laid snares for the one, yet was he overthrown: the devil laid
snares for the other, and yet he was crowned. Did not the devil take
<span id="page_255">p. 255</span> <span id="xv.iv-Page_255"></span>his
property? Yes, but he did not rob him of his godliness. Did he not lay
violent hands upon his sons? yes: but he did not shake his faith. Did he
not tear his body to pieces? yes but he did not find his treasure. Did
he not arm his wife against him? yes but he did not overthrow the
soldier. Did he not hurl arrows and darts at him? yes but he received no
wounds. He advanced his engines but could not shake the tower; he
conducted his billows against him, but did not sink the ship. Observe
this law I beseech you, yea I clasp your knees, if not with the bodily
hand, yet in spirit, and pour forth tears of supplication. Observe this
law I pray you, and no one can do you harm. Never call the rich man
happy; never call any man miserable save him who is living in sin: and
call him happy who lives in righteousness. For it is not the nature of
their circumstances, but the disposition of the men which makes both the
one and the other. Never be afraid of the sword if thy conscience does
not accuse thee: never be afraid in war if thy conscience is clear.
Where are they who have departed? tell me. Did not all men once bow down
to them? did not those who were in authority tremble greatly before
them? did they not pay court to them? But sin has come, and all things
are manifested in their true lights; they who were attendants have
become judges, the flatterers are turned into executioners; they who
once kissed his hands, dragged him themselves from the church, and he
who yesterday kissed his hand is to-day his enemy. Wherefore? Because
neither did he yesterday love him with sincerity. For the opportunity
came and the actors were unmasked. Didst thou not yesterday kiss his
hands, and call him saviour, and guardian, and benefactor? Didst thou
not compose panegyrics without end? wherefore to-day dost thou accuse
him? Why yesterday a praiser, and to-day an accuser? why yesterday utter
panegyrics, and to-day reproaches? What means this change? what means
this revolution?

<span id="xv.iv-p18"></span>5. But I am not like this: I was the subject
of his plots, yet I became his protector. I suffered countless troubles
at his hands, yet I did not retaliate. For I copy the example of my
Master, who said on the cross, “Forgive them, for they know not what
they do.” Now I say these things that you may not be perverted by the
suspicion of wicked men. Now many changes have taken place, since I had
the oversight of the city, and yet no one learns self-control? But when
I say no one, I do not condemn all, God forbid. For it is impossible
that this rich soil when it has received seed, should not produce one
ear of corn: but I am insatiable, I do not wish many to be saved but
all. And if but one be left in a perishing condition, I perish also, and
deem that the Shepherd should be imitated who had ninety-nine sheep, and
yet hastened after the one which had gone astray. <span
id="fr_824"></span>[825](#fn_824.md) How long will money last? how long
this silver and gold? how long these draughts of wine? how long the
flatteries of slaves? how long these goblets wreathed with garlands? how
long these satanic drinking feasts, full of diabolical activity?

<span id="xv.iv-p20"></span>Dost thou not know that the present life is
a sojourn in a far country? for art thou a citizen? Nay thou art a
wayfarer. Understandest thou what I say? Thou art not a citizen, but
thou art a wayfarer, and a traveller. Say not: I have this city and
that. No one has a city. The city is above. Present life is but a
journey. We are journeying on every day, while nature is running its
course. Some there are who store up goods on the way: some who bury
jewellery on the road. Now when you enter an inn do you beautify the
inn? not so, but you eat and drink and hasten to depart. The present
life is an inn: we have entered it, and we bring present life to a
close: let us be eager to depart with a good hope, let us leave nothing
here, that we may not lose it there. When you enter the inn, what do you
say to the servant? Take care where you put away our things, that you do
not leave anything behind here, that nothing may be lost, not even what
is small and trifling, in order that we may carry everything back to our
home. Thou art a wayfarer and traveller, and indeed more insignificant
than the wayfarer. How so? I will tell you. The wayfarer knows when he
is going into the inn, and when he is going out; for the egress as well
as the regress is in his own power: but when I enter the inn, that is to
say this present life, I know not when I shall go out: and it may be
that I am providing myself with sustenance for a long time when the
Master suddenly summons me saying “Thou fool, for whom shall those
things be which thou hast prepared? for on this very night thy soul is
being taken from thee.” <span id="fr_825"></span>[826](#fn_825.md) The time
of thy departure is uncertain, the tenure of thy possessions insecure,
there are innumerable precipices, and billows on every side of thee. Why
dost thou rave about shadows? why desert the reality and run after
shadows?

<span id="xv.iv-p22"></span>6. I say these things, and shall not cease
saying them, causing continual pain, and dressing the wounds; and this
not for the sake of the fallen, but of those who are still standing. For
they have departed, and their career is <span id="page_256">p.
256</span> <span id="xv.iv-Page_256"></span>ended, but those who are yet
standing have gained a more secure position through their calamities.
“What then,” you say, “shall we do?” Do one thing only, hate riches, and
love thy life—cast away thy goods; I do not say all of them, but cut off
the superfluities. Be not covetous of other men’s goods, strip not the
widow, plunder not the orphan, seize not his house: I do not address
myself to persons but to facts. But if any one’s conscience attacks him,
he himself is responsible for it, not my words. Why art thou grasping
where thou bringest ill-will upon thyself? Grasp where there is a crown
to be gained. Strive to lay hold not of earth but of heaven. “The
kingdom of Heaven belongs to violent men and men of violence take it by
force.” <span id="fr_826"></span>[827](#fn_826.md) Why dost thou lay hold
of the poor man who reproaches thee? Lay hold of Christ who praises thee
for it. Dost thou see thy senselessness and madness? Dost thou lay hold
of the poor man who has little? Christ says “lay hold of me; I thank
thee for it, lay hold of my kingdom and take it by violence.” If thou
art minded to lay hold of an earthly kingdom, or rather if thou art
minded to have designs upon it thou art punished; but in the case of the
heavenly kingdom thou art punished if thou dost not lay hold of it.
Where worldly things are concerned there is ill-will, but where
spiritual there is love. Meditate daily on these things, and if two days
hence thou seest another riding in a chariot, arrayed in raiment of
silk, and elated with pride, be not again dismayed and troubled. Praise
not a rich man, but only him who lives in righteousness. Revile not a
poor man, but learn to have an upright and accurate judgment in all
things.

<span id="xv.iv-p24"></span>Do not hold aloof from the Church; for
nothing is stronger than the Church. The Church is thy hope, thy
salvation, thy refuge. It is higher than the heaven, it is wider than
the earth. It never waxes old, but is always in full vigour. Wherefore
as significant of its solidity and stability Holy Scripture calls it a
mountain: or of its purity a virgin, or of its magnificence a queen; or
of its relationship to God a daughter; and to express its productiveness
it calls her barren who has borne seven: in fact it employs countless
names to represent its nobleness. For as the master of the Church has
many names: being called the Father, and the way, <span
id="fr_827"></span>[828](#fn_827.md) and the life, <span
id="fr_828"></span>[829](#fn_828.md) and the light, <span
id="fr_829"></span>[830](#fn_829.md) and the arm, <span
id="fr_830"></span>[831](#fn_830.md) and the propitiation, <span
id="fr_831"></span>[832](#fn_831.md) and the foundation, <span
id="fr_832"></span>[833](#fn_832.md) and the door, <span
id="fr_833"></span>[834](#fn_833.md) and the sinless one, <span
id="fr_834"></span>[835](#fn_834.md) and the treasure, <span
id="fr_835"></span>[836](#fn_835.md) and Lord, and God, and Son, and the
only begotten, and the form of God, <span
id="fr_836"></span>[837](#fn_836.md) and the image <span
id="fr_837"></span>[838](#fn_837.md) of God so is it with the Church
itself: does one name suffice to present the whole truth? by no means.
But for this reason there are countless names, that we may learn
something concerning God, though it be but a small part. Even so the
Church also is called by many names. She is called a virgin, albeit
formerly she was an harlot: for this is the miracle wrought by the
Bridegroom, that He took her who was an harlot and hath made her a
virgin. Oh! what a new and strange event! With us marriage destroys
virginity, but with God marriage hath restored it. With us she who is a
virgin, when married, is a virgin no longer: with Christ she who is an
harlot, when married, becomes a virgin.

<span id="xv.iv-p36"></span>7. Let the heretic who inquires curiously
into the nature of heavenly generation saying “how did the Father beget
the Son?” interpret this single fact, ask him how did the Church, being
an harlot, become a virgin? and how did she having brought forth
children remain a virgin? “For I am jealous over you,” saith Paul, “with
a godly jealousy, for I espoused you to one husband that I might present
you as a pure virgin to Christ.” <span id="fr_838"></span>[839](#fn_838.md)
What wisdom and understanding! “I am jealous over you with a godly
jealousy.” What means this? “I am jealous,” he says: art thou jealous
seeing thou art a spiritual man? I am jealous he says as God is. And
hath God jealousy? yea the jealousy not of passion, but of love, and
earnest zeal. I am jealous over you with the jealousy of God. Shall I
tell thee how He manifests His jealousy? He saw the world corrupted by
devils, and He delivered His own Son to save it. For words spoken in
reference to God have not the same force as when spoken in reference to
ourselves: for instance we say God is jealous, God is wroth, God
repents, God hates. These words are human, but they have a meaning which
becomes the nature of God. How is God jealous? “I am jealous over you
with the jealousy of God.” <span id="fr_839"></span>[840](#fn_839.md) Is
God wroth? “O Lord reproach me not in thine indignation.” <span
id="fr_840"></span>[841](#fn_840.md) Doth God slumber? “Awake, wherefore
sleepest thou, O Lord?” <span id="fr_841"></span>[842](#fn_841.md) Doth God
repent? “I repent that I have made man.” <span
id="fr_842"></span>[843](#fn_842.md) Doth God hate? “My soul hateth your
feasts and your new moons.” <span id="fr_843"></span>[844](#fn_843.md) Well
do not consider the poverty of the expressions: but grasp their divine
meaning. God is jealous, <span id="page_257">p. 257</span> <span
id="xv.iv-Page_257"></span>for He loves, God is wroth, not as yielding
to passion, but for the purpose of chastising, and punishing. God
sleeps, not as really slumbering, but as being long-suffering. Choose
out the expression. Thus when thou hearest that God begets the Son,
think not of division but of the unity of substance. For God has taken
many of these words from us as we also have borrowed others from Him,
that we may receive honour thereby.

<span id="xv.iv-p43"></span>8. Dost thou understand what I have said?
Attend carefully my beloved. There are divine names, and there are human
names. God has received from me, and He Himself hath given to me. Give
me thine, and take mine He says. Thou hast need of mine: I have no need
of thine, but thou hast of mine inasmuch as my nature is unmixed, but
thou art a human being encompassed with a body, seeking also corporeal
terms in order that, by borrowing expressions which are familiar to
thee, thou who art thus encompassed with a body, mayest be able to think
on thoughts which transcend thy understanding. What kind of names hath
He received from me, and what kind hath He given to me? He Himself is
God, and He hath called me God; with Him is the essential nature as an
actual fact, with me only the honour of the name: “I have said ye are
gods, and ye are all children of the most highest.” <span
id="fr_844"></span>[845](#fn_844.md) Here are words, but in the other case
there is the actual reality. He hath called me god, for by that name I
have received honour. He Himself was called man, he was called Son of
man, he was called the Way, the Door, the Rock. These words He borrowed
from me; the others He gave from Himself to me. Wherefore was He called
the Way? That thou mightest understand that by Him we have access to the
Father. Wherefore was He called the Rock? that thou mightest understand
the secure and unshaken character of the faith. Wherefore was He called
the Foundation? That thou mightest understand that He upholdeth all
things. Wherefore was He called the Root? That thou mightest understand
that in Him we have our power of growth. Wherefore was He called the
Shepherd? Because He feeds us. Wherefore was He called a sheep? Because
He was sacrificed for us and became a propitiatory offering. Wherefore
was He called the Life? Because He raised us up when we were dead.
Wherefore was He called the Light? Because He delivered us from
darkness. Why was He called an Arm? Because He is of one substance with
the Father. Why was He called the Word? Because He was begotten of the
Father. For as my word is the offspring of my spirit, even so was the
Son begotten of the Father. Wherefore is He called our raiment? Because
I was clothed with Him when I was baptized. Why is He called a table?
Because I feed upon Him when I partake of the mysteries. Why is He
called a house? Because I dwell in Him. Why is He called an inmate of
the house? Because we become His Temple. Wherefore is He called the
Head? Because I have been made a member of His. Why is He called a
Bridegroom? Because He hath taken me as His bride. Wherefore is He
called undefiled? Because He took me as a virgin. Wherefore is He called
Master? Because I am His bondmaid.

<span id="xv.iv-p45"></span>9. For observe the Church, how, as I was
saying, she is sometimes a bride, sometimes a daughter, sometimes a
virgin, sometimes a bondmaid, sometimes a queen, sometimes a barren
woman, sometimes a mountain, sometimes a garden, sometimes fruitful in
children, sometimes a lily, sometimes a fountain: She is all things.
Therefore having heard these things, think not I pray you that they are
corporeal; but stretch thy thought further: for such things cannot be
corporeal. For example: the mountain is not the maid: the maid is not
the bride: the queen is not the bond-maid: yet the Church is all these
things. Wherefore? because the element in which they exist is not
corporeal but spiritual. For in a corporeal sphere these things are
confined within narrow limits: but in a spiritual sphere they have a
wide field of operation. “The queen stood on thy right hand.” <span
id="fr_845"></span>[846](#fn_845.md) The queen? How did she who was
down-trodden and poor become a queen? and where did she ascend? the
queen herself stood on high by the side of the king. How? because the
king became a servant; He was not that by nature, but He became so.
Understand therefore the things which belong to the Godhead, and discern
those which belong to the Dispensation. Understand what He *was,* and
what He *became* for thy sake, and do not confuse things which are
distinct, nor make the argument of his lovingkindness an occasion for
blasphemy. He was lofty, and she was lowly: lofty not by position but by
nature. His essence was pure, and imperishable: His nature was
incorruptible, unintelligible, invisible, incomprehensible, eternal,
unchangeable, transcending the nature of angels, higher than the powers
above, overpowering reason, surpassing thought, apprehended not by sight
but by faith alone. Angels beheld Him and trembled, the Cheru<span
id="page_258">p. 258</span> <span id="xv.iv-Page_258"></span>bim veiled
themselves with their wings, in awe. He looked upon the earth, and
caused it to tremble: He threatened the sea and dried it up: <span
id="fr_846"></span>[847](#fn_846.md) he brought rivers out of the desert:
He weighed the mountains in scales, and the valleys in a balance. <span
id="fr_847"></span>[848](#fn_847.md) How shall I express myself? how shall
I present the truth? His greatness hath no bounds, His wisdom is beyond
reckoning, His judgments are untraceable, His ways unsearchable. <span
id="fr_848"></span>[849](#fn_848.md) Such is His greatness and His power,
if indeed it is safe even to use such expressions. But what am I to do?
I am a human being and I speak in human language: my tongue is of earth
and I crave forgiveness from my Lord. For I do not use these expressions
in a spirit of presumption, but on account of the poverty of my
resources arising from my feebleness and the nature of our human tongue.
Be merciful to me, O Lord, for I utter these words not in presumption
but because I have no others: nevertheless I do not rest content with
the meanness of my speech, but soar upwards on the wings of my
understanding. Such is His greatness and power. I say this, that without
dwelling on the words, or on the poverty of the expressions, thou mayest
also thyself learn to act in the same way. Why dost thou marvel if I do
this, inasmuch as He also does the same, when He wishes to present
something to our minds which transcends human powers? Since He addresses
human beings He uses also human illustration, which are indeed
insufficient to represent the thing spoken of, and cannot exhibit the
full proportions of the matter, yet suffice for the infirmity of the
hearers.

<span id="xv.iv-p50"></span>10. Make an effort, and do not grow weary of
my prolonged discourse. For as when He manifests Himself, He is not
manifested as He really is, nor is His bare essence manifested (for no
man hath seen God in His real nature; for when He is but partially
revealed the Cherubim tremble—the mountains smoke, the sea is dried up,
the heaven is shaken, and if the revelation were not partial who could
endure it?) as then, I say, He does not manifest Himself as He really
is, but only as the beholder is able to see Him, therefore doth He
appear sometimes in the form of old age, sometimes of youth, sometimes
in fire, sometimes in air, sometimes in water, sometimes in armour, not
altering his essential nature, but fashioning His appearance to suit the
various condition of those who are affected by it. In like manner also
when any one wishes to say anything concerning Him he employs human
illustrations. For instance I say: “He went up into the mountain and He
was transfigured before them, and His countenance shone as the sun, and
His raiment became white as snow.” <span
id="fr_849"></span>[850](#fn_849.md) He disclosed, it is said, a little of
the Godhead, He manifested to them the God dwelling amongst them “and He
was transfigured before them.” Attend carefully to the statement. The
writer says and He was transfigured before them, and His raiment shone
as the light, and His countenance was as the sun. When I said “such is
His greatness and power” and added “be merciful to me O Lord,” (for I do
not rest satisfied with the expression but am perplexed, having no other
framed for the purpose) I wish you to understand, that I learned this
lesson from Holy Scripture. The evangelist then wished to describe His
splendour and he says “He shone.” How did He shine? tell me.
Exceedingly. And how do you express this? He shone “as the sun.” As the
sun sayest thou? Yea. Wherefore? Because I know not any other luminary
more brilliant. And He was white sayest thou as snow? wherefore as snow?
Because I know not any other substance which is whiter. For that He did
not really shine thus is proved by what follows: the disciples fell to
the ground. If he had shone as the sun the disciples would not have
fallen; for they saw the sun every day, and did not fall: but inasmuch
as he shone more brilliantly than the sun or snow, they, being unable to
bear the splendour, fell to the earth.

<span id="xv.iv-p52"></span>11. Tell me then, O evangelist, did He shine
more brightly than the sun, and yet dost thou say, “as the sun?” Yea:
wishing to make that light known to thee, I know not any other greater
luminary, I have no other comparison which holds a royal place amongst
luminaries. I have said these things that thou mayest not rest
contentedly in the poverty of the language used: I have pointed out to
thee the fall of the disciples: they fell to the earth, and were
stupified and overwhelmed with slumber. “Arise” He said, and lifted them
up, and yet they were oppressed. For they could not endure the excessive
brightness of that shining, but heavy sleep took possession of their
eyes: so far did the light which was manifested exceed the light of the
sun. Yet the evangelist said “as the sun,” because that luminary is
familiar to us and surpasses all the rest.

<span id="xv.iv-p53"></span>But as I was saying, He who was thus great
and powerful desired an harlot. I speak of our human nature under that
name. If a man indeed desire an harlot he is condemned, and doth God
desire one? Yea verily. Again a <span id="page_259">p. 259</span> <span
id="xv.iv-Page_259"></span>man desireth an harlot that he may become a
fornicator: but God that He may convert the harlot into a virgin: so
that the desire of the man is the destruction of her who is desired: but
the desire of God is salvation to her who is desired. And why did He who
is so great and powerful desire an harlot? that He might become the
husband thereof. How doth He act? He doth not send to her any of His
servants, He sendeth not angel, archangel, Cherubim, or Seraphim; but He
himself draws nigh Who loves her. Again when thou hearest of love, deem
it not sensuous. Cull out the thoughts which are contained in the words,
even as an excellent bee settles on the flowers, and takes the honey
comb, but leaves the herbs God desired an harlot, and how doth He act?
He does not conduct her on high; for He would not bring an harlot into
Heaven, but He Himself comes down. Since she could not ascend on high,
He descends to earth. He cometh to the harlot, and is not ashamed: He
cometh to her secret dwelling place. He beholds her in her drunkenness.
And how doth He come? not in the bare essence of His original nature,
but He becomes that which the harlot was, not in intention but in
reality does He become this, in order that she may not be scared when
she sees Him, that she may not rush away, and escape. He cometh to the
harlot, and becomes man. And how does He become this? He is conceived in
the womb, he increases little by little and follows like me the course
of human growth. Who is it who does this? the Deity as manifested, not
the Godhead; the form of the servant not that of the Master; the flesh
which belongs to me, not the essential nature which belongs to Him: He
increases little by little, and has intercourse with mankind. Although
He finds the harlot, human nature, full of sores, brutalised, and
oppressed by devils, how does He act? He draws nigh to her. She sees Him
and flees away. He calleth the wise men saying Why are ye afraid? I am
not a judge, but a physician. “I came not to judge the world but to save
the world.” <span id="fr_850"></span>[851](#fn_850.md) Straightway He
calleth the wise men. Oh! new and strange event. The immediate
first-fruits of His coming are wise men. He who upholds the world lieth
in a manger, and He who careth for all things is a nursling in swaddling
bands. The temple is founded and the God dwelleth therein. And wise men
come and straightway worship Him: the publican comes and is turned into
an evangelist: the harlot comes and is turned into a maiden: the
Canaanitish woman comes and partakes of his lovingkindness. This is the
mark of one who loves, to forbear demanding an account of sins, and to
forgive transgressions and offences. And how does He act? He takes the
sinner and espouses her to himself. And what doth He give her? a signet
ring. Of what nature? the Holy Spirit. Paul saith “now He who
establisheth us with you is God who hath also sealed us, and given the
earnest of the Spirit.” <span id="fr_851"></span>[852](#fn_851.md) The
Spirit then He giveth her. Next He saith “Did not I plant thee in a
garden?” She saith “yea.” And how didst thou fall from thence? “The
devil came and cast me out of the garden.” Thou wast planted in the
garden and he cast thee out: behold I plant thee in myself, I uphold
thee. How? The devil dares not approach me. Neither do I take thee up
into Heaven; but something greater than Heaven is here: I carry thee in
myself who am the Lord of Heaven. The shepherd carries thee and the wolf
no longer comes: or rather I permit him to approach. And so the Lord
carrieth our nature: and the devil approaches and is worsted. “I have
planted thee in myself:” therefore He saith “I am the root, ye are the
branches:” <span id="fr_852"></span>[853](#fn_852.md) so He planted her in
Himself. “But,” she saith, “I am a sinner and unclean.” “Let not this
trouble thee, I am a physician. I know my vessel, I know how it was
perverted. It was formerly a vessel of clay, and it was perverted. I
remodel it by means of the laver of regeneration and I submit it to the
action of fire.” For observe: He took dust from the earth and made the
man; He formed him. The devil came, and perverted him. Then the Lord
came, took him again, and remoulded, and recast him in baptism, and He
suffered not his body to be of clay, but made it of a harder ware. He
subjected the soft clay to the fire of the Holy Spirit. “He shall
baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire:” <span
id="fr_853"></span>[854](#fn_853.md) He was baptized with water that he
might be remodelled, with fire that he might be hardened. Therefore the
Prophet speaking beforehand under divine guidance declared “Thou shalt
dash them in pieces like vessels of the potter.” <span
id="fr_854"></span>[855](#fn_854.md) He did not say like vessels of
earthenware which every one possesses: for by a potter’s vessels are
meant those which the potter is fashioning on the wheel: now the
potter’s vessels are of clay, but ours are of harder ware. Speaking
beforehand therefore of the remoulding which is wrought by means of
baptism he saith, “thou shalt dash them in pieces like vessels of a
potter”—He means that He remodels and recasts them. I descend into the
water <span id="page_260">p. 260</span> <span
id="xv.iv-Page_260"></span>of baptism, and the fashion of my nature is
remoulded, and the fire of the Spirit recasts it, and it is turned into
a harder ware. And that my words are no empty vaunt hear what Job says,
“He hath made us as clay,” <span id="fr_855"></span>[856](#fn_855.md) and
Paul, “but we have this treasure in earthen vessels.” <span
id="fr_856"></span>[857](#fn_856.md) But consider the strength of the
earthen vessel: for it has been hardened not by fire, but by the Spirit.
How was it proved to be an earthen vessel? “Five times received I forty
stripes save one, thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I
stoned,” <span id="fr_857"></span>[858](#fn_857.md) and yet the earthen
vessel was not shattered. “A day and a night have I been in the deep.”
He hath been in the deep, and the earthen vessel was not dissolved: he
suffered shipwreck and the treasure was not lost; the ship was submerged
and yet the freight floated. “But we have this treasure” he says. What
kind of treasure? a supply of the Spirit, righteousness, sanctification,
redemption. Of what nature, tell me? “in the name of Jesus Christ rise
up and walk.” <span id="fr_858"></span>[859](#fn_858.md) “Æneas, Jesus
Christ maketh thee whole,” <span id="fr_859"></span>[860](#fn_859.md) I say
unto thee thou evil spirit, go out of him. <span
id="fr_860"></span>[861](#fn_860.md)

<span id="xv.iv-p65"></span>12. Hast thou seen a treasure more brilliant
than royal treasures? For what can the pearl of a king do like that
which the words of an Apostle effected? Set crowns innumerable upon dead
men, and they will not be raised: but one word went forth from an
Apostle, and it brought back revoked nature, and restored it to its
ancient condition. “But we have this treasure.” O treasure which not
only is preserved, but also preserves the house where it is stored up.
Dost thou understand what I have said? The kings of the earth, and
rulers when they have treasures, prepare large houses, having strong
walls, bars, doors, guards, and bolts in order that the treasure may be
preserved: but Christ did the contrary: He placed the treasure not in a
stone vessel but in an earthen one. If the treasure is great wherefore
is the vessel weak? But the reason why the vessel is weak is not because
the treasure is great; for this is not preserved by the vessel, but
itself preserves the vessel. I deposit the treasure: who is able
henceforth to steal it? The devil has come, the world has come,
multitudes have come, and yet they have not stolen the treasure: the
vessel has been scourged, yet the treasure was not betrayed; it has been
drowned in the sea, yet the treasure was not shipwrecked: it has died
yet the treasure survives. He gave therefore the earnest of the Spirit.
Where are they who blaspheme the Spirit’s majesty? Give ye heed. “He
that establisheth us with you in Christ is God who also hath given the
earnest of the Spirit.” <span id="fr_861"></span>[862](#fn_861.md) You all
know that the earnest is a small part of the whole; let me tell you how.
Some one goes to buy a house at a great price; and he says “give me an
earnest that I may have confidence: or one goes to take a wife for
himself, he arranges about dowry and property, and he says “give me an
earnest.” Observe: in the purchase of a slave and in all covenants there
is an earnest. Since then Christ made a covenant with us (for He was
about to take me as a bride) he also assigned a dowry to me not of
money, but of blood. But this dowry which He assigns is the bestowal of
good things “such as eye hath not seen, and ear hath not heard, neither
hath entered into the heart of man.” <span
id="fr_862"></span>[863](#fn_862.md) He assigned them for the
dowry:—immortality, praise with the angels, release from death, freedom
from sin, the inheritance of a kingdom (so great are his riches),
righteousness, sanctification, deliverance from present evils, discovery
of future blessings. Great was my dowry. Now attend carefully: mark what
He does. He came to take the harlot, for so I call her, unclean as she
was, that thou mightest understand the love of the bridegroom. He came;
He took me: He assigns me a dowry: He saith “I give thee my wealth.”
How? “Hast thou lost,” He saith, “paradise?” take it back. Hast thou
lost thy beauty? take it back; take all these things. But yet the dowry
was not given to me here.

<span id="xv.iv-p68"></span>13. Observe, this is the reason why He
speaks beforehand with reference to this dowry; He warranted to me in
the dowry the resurrection of the body,—immortality. For immortality
does not always follow resurrection, but the two are distinct. For many
have risen, and been again laid low, like Lazarus and the bodies of the
saints. <span id="fr_863"></span>[864](#fn_863.md) But in this case it is
not so, but the promise is of resurrection, immortality, a place in the
joyful company of angels, the meeting of the Son of Man in the clouds,
and the fulfilment of the saying “so shall we ever be with the
Lord,” <span id="fr_864"></span>[865](#fn_864.md) the release from death,
the freedom from sin, the complete overthrow of destruction. Of what
kind is that? “Eye hath not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into
the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love
Him.” Dost thou give me good things which I know not? He saith “yea;
only be espoused to me here, love me in this world.” “Wherefore dost
thou not give me the dowry here?” “It will be given when thou hast come
to my Father, when thou hast entered the royal palace. Didst thou come
to me! <span id="page_261">p. 261</span> <span
id="xv.iv-Page_261"></span>nay I came to thee. I came not that thou
shouldst abide here but that I might take thee and return. Seek not the
dowry here: all depends on hope, and faith. “And dost thou give me
nothing in this world?” He answers. “Receive an earnest that thou mayest
trust me concerning that which is to come: receive pledges and betrothal
gifts.” Therefore Paul saith “I have espoused you.” <span
id="fr_865"></span>[866](#fn_865.md) As gifts of betrothal God has given us
present blessings: they are an earnest of the future; but the full dowry
abides in the other world. How so? I will tell you. Here I grow old,
there I grow not old; here I die, there I die not, here I sorrow, there
I sorrow not; here is poverty, and disease, and intrigue, there nothing
of that kind exists: here is darkness and light, there is light alone:
here is intrigue, there is liberty; here is disease, there is health;
here is life which has an end, there is life which hath no end; here is
sin, there is righteousness, and sin is banished; here is envy, there
nothing of the kind exists. “Give me these things” one says; “Nay! wait
in order that thy fellow-servants also may be saved; wait I say. He who
establisheth us and hath given us the earnest”—what kind of earnest? the
Holy Spirit, the supply of the Spirit. Let me speak concerning the
Spirit. He gave the signet ring to the Apostles, saying “take this and
give it to all.” Is the ring then portioned out, and yet not divided? It
is so. Let me teach you the meaning of the supply of the Spirit: Peter
received, and Paul also received the Holy Spirit. He went about the
world, he released sinners from their sins, he restored the lame, he
clothed the naked, he raised the dead, he cleansed the lepers, he
bridled the devil, he strangled the demons, he held converse with God,
he planted a Church, levelled temples to the earth, overturned altars,
destroyed vice, established virtue, made angels of men.

<span id="xv.iv-p72"></span>14. All these things we were. But “the
earnest” filled the whole world. And when I say the whole I mean all
which the sun shines upon, sea, islands, mountains, valleys, and hills.
Paul went hither and thither, like some winged creature, with one mouth
only contending against the enemy, he the tentmaker, who handled the
workman’s knife and sewed skins together: and yet this his craft was no
hindrance to his virtue, but the tentmaker was stronger than demons, the
uneloquent man was wiser than the wise. Whence was this? He received the
earnest, he bore the signet ring and carried it about. All men saw that
the King had espoused our nature: the demon saw it and retreated, he saw
the earnest, and trembled and withdrew: he saw but the Apostle’s
garments <span id="fr_866"></span>[867](#fn_866.md) and fled. O the power
of the Holy Spirit. He bestowed authority not on the soul, nor on the
body, but even on raiment; nor on raiment only but even on a shadow.
Peter went about and his shadow put diseases to flight, <span
id="fr_867"></span>[868](#fn_867.md) and expelled demons, and raised the
dead to life. Paul went about the world, cutting away the thorns of
ungodliness, sowing broadcast the seeds of godliness, like an excellent
ploughman handling the ploughshare of doctrine. And to whom did he go?
To Thracians, to Scythians, to Indians, to Maurians, to Sardinians, to
Goths, to wild savages, and he changed them all. By what means? By means
of “the earnest.” How was he sufficient for these things? By the grace
of the Spirit. Unskilled, ill-clothed, ill-shod he was upheld by Him
“who also hath given the earnest of the Spirit.” Therefore he saith “and
who is sufficient for these things? <span
id="fr_868"></span>[869](#fn_868.md) But our sufficiency is of God, who
hath made us sufficient as ministers of the new Testament, not of the
letter but of the Spirit.” <span id="fr_869"></span>[870](#fn_869.md)
Behold what the Spirit hath wrought: He found the earth filled with
demons and He has made it heaven. For meditate not on present things but
review the past in your thought. Formerly there was lamentation, there
were altars everywhere, everywhere the smoke and fumes of sacrifice,
everywhere unclean rites and mysteries, and sacrifices, everywhere
demons holding their orgies, everywhere a citadel of the devil,
everywhere fornication decked with wreaths of honour; and Paul stood
alone. How did he escape being overwhelmed, or torn in pieces? How could
he open his mouth? He entered the Thebaid, <span
id="fr_870"></span>[871](#fn_870.md) and made captives of men, He entered
the royal palace, and made a disciple of the king. <span
id="fr_871"></span>[872](#fn_871.md) He entered the hall of judgment, and
the judge saith to him “almost thou persuadest me to become a
Christian,” <span id="fr_872"></span>[873](#fn_872.md) and the judge became
a disciple. He entered the prison, and took the jailor captive. <span
id="fr_873"></span>[874](#fn_873.md) He visited an island of barbarians,
and made a viper the instrument of his teaching. <span
id="fr_874"></span>[875](#fn_874.md) He visited the Romans, and attracted
the senate to his doctrine. He visited rivers, and desert places in all
parts of the world. There is no land or sea which has not shared in the
benefits of his labours; for God has given human nature the earnest of
His signet, <span id="page_262">p. 262</span> <span
id="xv.iv-Page_262"></span>and when He gives it He saith: some things I
give thee now, and others I promise. Therefore the prophet saith
concerning her “The queen did stand upon thy right hand in a vesture
woven with gold.” He does not mean a real vesture, but virtue. Therefore
the Scripture elsewhere saith “How camest thou in hither not having a
wedding garment?” so that here he does not mean a garment, but
fornication, and foul and unclean living. As then foul raiment signifies
sin, so does golden raiment signify virtue. But this raiment belonged to
the king. He Himself bestowed the raiment upon her: for she was naked,
naked and disfigured. “The queen stood on thy right hand in a vesture
woven with gold.” <span id="fr_875"></span>[876](#fn_875.md) He is speaking
not of raiment but of virtue. Observe: the expression itself has great
nobility of meaning. He does not say “in a vesture of gold” but “in a
vesture woven with gold.” Listen intelligently. A vesture of gold is one
which is gold throughout: but a vesture woven with gold is one which is
partly of gold, partly of silk. Why then did he say that the bride wore
not a vesture of gold, but one woven with gold? Attend carefully. He
means the constitution of the Church in its varied manifestations. For
since we do not all belong to one condition of life, but one is a
virgin, another a widow, a third lives a life of devotion—so the robe of
the Church signifies the constitution of the Church.

<span id="xv.iv-p83"></span>15. Inasmuch then as our Master knew that if
He carved out only one road for us, many must shrink from it, He carved
out divers roads. Thou canst not enter the kingdom it may be by the way
of virginity. Enter it then by the way of single marriage. Canst thou
not enter it by one marriage? Perchance thou mayest by means of a second
marriage. Thou canst not enter by the way of continence: enter then by
the way of almsgiving: or thou canst not enter by the way of almsgiving?
then try the way of fasting. If thou canst not use this way, take
that—or if not that, then take this. Therefore the prophet spoke not of
a garment of gold, but of one woven with gold. It is of silk, or purple,
or gold. Thou canst not be a golden part? then be a silken one. I accept
thee, if only thou art clothed in my raiment. Therefore also Paul saith
“If any man builds upon this foundation, gold, silver, precious
stones.” <span id="fr_876"></span>[877](#fn_876.md) Thou canst not be the
precious stone? then be the gold. Thou canst not be the gold? then be
the silver, if only thou art resting upon the foundation. And again
elsewhere, “there is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the
moon, and another glory of the stars.” <span
id="fr_877"></span>[878](#fn_877.md) Thou canst not be a sun? then be a
moon. Thou canst not be a moon? then be a star. Thou canst not be a
large star? be content to be a little one if only thou art in the
Heaven. Thou canst not be a virgin? then live continently in the married
state, only abiding in the Church. Thou canst not be without
possessions? then give alms, only abiding in the Church, only wearing
the proper raiment, only submitting to the queen. <span
id="fr_878"></span>[879](#fn_878.md) The raiment is woven with gold, it is
manifold in texture. I do not bar the way against thee: for the
abundance of virtues has rendered the dispensation of the king easy in
operation. “Clothed in a vesture woven with gold, manifold in texture.”
Her vesture is manifold: unfold, if you please, the deep meaning of the
expression here used, and fix your eyes upon this garment woven with
gold. For here indeed some live celibate, others live in an honourable
estate of matrimony being not much inferior to them: some have married
once, others are widows in the flower of their age. For what purpose is
a paradise? and wherefore its variety? having divers flowers, and trees,
and many pearls. There are many stars, but only one sun: there are many
ways of living, but only one paradise; there are many temples, but only
one mother of them all. There is the body, the eye, the finger, but all
these make up but one man. There is the same distinction between the
small, the great, and the less. The virgin hath need of the married
woman; for the virgin also is the product of marriage, that marriage may
not be despised by her. The virgin is the root of marriage: thus all
things have been linked together, the small with the great, and the
great with the small. “The queen did stand on thy right hand clothed in
a vesture wrought with gold, manifold in texture.” Then follows
“Hearken! O daughter.” The conductor of the bride says that thou art
about to go forth from thy home to the home of the bridegroom who in his
essential nature far surpasses thee. I am the conductor of the bride.
“Hearken O daughter.” Did she immediately become the wife? Yea: for here
there is nothing corporeal. For He espoused her as a wife, He loves her
as a daughter, He provides for her as a handmaid, He guards her as a
virgin, He fences her round like a garden, and cherishes her like a
member: as a head He provides for her, as a root he causes her to grow,
as a shepherd He feeds her, as a bridegroom He weds her, as a
propitiation He pardons her, as a sheep He is sacrificed, as a
bridegroom He preserves her in beauty, as a <span id="page_263">p.
263</span> <span id="xv.iv-Page_263"></span>husband He provides for her
support. Many are the meanings in order that we may enjoy a part if it
be but a small part of the divine economy of grace. “Hearken O daughter”
and behold, and look upon things which are bridal and yet spiritual.
Hearken O daughter. She was at first a daughter of demons, a daughter of
the earth, unworthy of the earth and now she has become a daughter of
the king. And this He wished who loved her. For he who loves does not
investigate character: love does not regard uncomeliness: on this
account indeed is it called love because it oftentimes hath affection
for an uncomely person. <span id="fr_879"></span>[880](#fn_879.md) Thus
also did Christ. He saw one who was uncomely (for comely I could not
call her) and He loved her, and He makes her young, not having spot or
wrinkle. Oh what a bridegroom! adorning with grace the ungracefulness of
his bride! Hearken O daughter! hearken and behold! Two things He saith
“Hearken” and “Behold,” two which depend on thyself, one on thy eyes,
the other on thy hearing. Now since her dowry depended on hearing (and
although some of you have been acute enough to perceive this already,
let them tarry for those who are feebler: I commend those who have
anticipated the truth, and make allowances for those who only follow in
their track) since the dowry then depended on hearing—(and what is meant
by hearing? faith: for “faith cometh by hearing” faith as opposed to
fruition, and actual experience) I said before that He divided the dowry
into two, and gave some portion to the bride for an earnest, whilst He
promised others in the future. What did He give her? He gave her
forgiveness of sins, remission of punishment, righteousness,
sanctification, redemption, the body of the Lord, the divine, spiritual
Table, the resurrection of the dead. For all these things the Apostles
had. Therefore He gave some parts and promised others. Of some there was
experience and fruition, others depended upon hope and faith. Now
listen. What did He bestow? Baptism and the Sacrifice. Of these there is
experience. What did He promise? Resurrection, immortality of the body,
union with angels, a place in the joyful company of archangels, and as a
citizen in His kingdom, immaculate life, the good things “which eye hath
not seen, nor ear heard nor have entered into the heart of man, things
which God hath prepared for them that love Him.”

<span id="xv.iv-p88"></span>16. Understand what is said, lest ye lose
it: I am labouring to enable you to perceive it. The dowry of the bride
then was divided into two portions consisting of things present and
things to come; things seen and things heard, things given and things
taken on trust, things experienced, and things to be enjoyed hereafter;
things belonging to present life, and things to come after the
resurrection. The former things you see, the latter you hear. Observe
then what He says to her that you may not suppose that she received the
former things only, though they be great and ineffable, and surpassing
all understanding. “Hearken O daughter and behold;” hear the latter
things and behold the former that thou mayest not say “am I again to
depend on hope, again on faith, again on the future?” See now: I give
some things, and I promise others: the latter indeed depend on hope, but
do thou receive the others as pledges, as an earnest, as a proof of the
remainder. I promise thee a kingdom: and let present things be the
ground of thy trust, thy trust in me. Dost thou promise me a kingdom?
Yea. I have given thee the greater part, even the Lord of the kingdom,
for “he who spared not his own son, but gave him up for us all, how
shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?” <span
id="fr_880"></span>[881](#fn_880.md) Dost thou give me the resurrection of
the body? Yea; I have given thee the greater part. What is the nature of
it? Release from sins. How is that the greater part? Because sin brought
forth death. I have destroyed the parent, and shall I not destroy the
offspring? I have dried up the root, and shall I not destroy the
produce. “Hearken O daughter and behold.” What am I to behold? Dead men
raised to life, lepers cleansed, the sea restrained, the paralytic
braced up into vigour, paradise opened, loaves poured forth in
abundance, sins remitted, the lame man leaping, the robber made a
citizen of paradise, the publican turned into an evangelist, the harlot
become more modest than the maid. Hear and behold. Hear of the former
things and behold these. Accept from present things a proof of the
others; concerning those I have given thee pledges, things which are
better than they are. “What is the meaning of this thy saying?” These
things are mine. “Hearken O daughter and behold.” These things are my
dower to thee. And what doth the bride contribute? Let us see. What I
pray thee dost thou bring that thou mayest not be portionless? What can
I, she answers, bring to thee from heathen altars, and the steam of
sacrifices and from devils? What have I to contribute? what? sayest
thou? Thy will and thy faith. “Hearken O daughter and behold.” And what
wilt thou have me do? “Forget thy own <span id="page_264">p. 264</span>
<span id="xv.iv-Page_264"></span>people.” What kind of people? the
devils, the idols, the sacrificial smoke, and steam, and blood. “Forget
thy own people, and thy father’s house.” Leave thy father and come after
me. I left my Father, and came to thee, and wilt thou not leave thy
father? But when the word leave is used in reference to the Son do not
understand by it an actual leaving. What He means is “I condescended, I
accommodated myself to thee, I assumed human flesh.” This is the duty of
the bridegroom, and of the bride, that thou shouldest abandon thy
parents, and that we should be wedded to one another. “Hearken O
daughter and behold, and forget thy own people, and thy father’s house.”
And what dost thou give me if I do forget them? “and the king shall
desire thy beauty.” Thou hast the Lord for thy lover. If thou hast Him
for thy lover, thou hast also the things which are his. I trust ye may
be able to understand what is said: for the thought is a subtle one, and
I wish to stop the mouth of the Jews.

<span id="xv.iv-p90"></span>Now exert your minds I pray: for whether one
hears, or forbears to hear I shall dig and till the soil. “Hearken O
daughter, and behold, forget also thy own people, and thy father’s
house, and the king shall desire thy beauty.” By beauty in this passage
the Jew understands sensible beauty; not spiritual but corporeal.

<span id="xv.iv-p91"></span>17. Attend, and let us learn what corporeal,
and what spiritual beauty are. There is soul and body: they are two
substances: there is a beauty of body, and there is a beauty of soul.
What is beauty of body? an extended eyebrow, a merry glance, a blushing
cheek, ruddy lips, a straight neck, long wavy hair, tapering fingers,
upright stature, a fair blooming complexion. Does this bodily beauty
come from nature, or from choice? Confessedly it comes from nature.
Attend that thou mayest learn the conception of philosophers. This
beauty whether of the countenance, of the eye, of the hair, of the brow,
does it come from nature, or from choice? It is obvious that it comes
from nature. For the ungraceful woman, even if she cultivate beauty in
countless ways, cannot become graceful in body: for natural conditions
are fixed, and confined by limits which they cannot pass over. Therefore
the beautiful woman is always beautiful, even if she has no taste for
beauty: and the ungraceful cannot make herself graceful, nor the
graceful ungraceful. Wherefore? because these things come from nature.
Well! thou hast seen corporeal beauty. Now let us turn inwards to the
soul: let the handmaid approach the mistress! let us turn I say to the
soul. Look upon that beauty, or rather listen to it: for thou canst not
see it since it is invisible—Listen to that beauty. What then is beauty
of soul? Temperance, mildness, almsgiving, love, brotherly kindness,
tender affection, obedience to God, the fulfilment of the law,
righteousness, contrition of heart. These things are the beauty of the
soul. These things then are not the results of nature, but of moral
disposition. And he who does not possess these things is able to receive
them, and he who has them, if he becomes careless, loses them. For as in
the case of the body I was saying that she who is ungraceful cannot
become graceful; so in the case of the soul I say the contrary that the
graceless soul can become full of grace. For what was more graceless
than the soul of Paul when he was a blasphemer and insulter: what more
full of grace when he said “I have fought the good fight, I have
finished the course, I have kept the faith.” <span
id="fr_881"></span>[882](#fn_881.md) What was more graceless than the soul
of the robber? what more full of grace when he heard the words “Verily I
say unto thee to-day shalt thou be with me in paradise?” <span
id="fr_882"></span>[883](#fn_882.md) What was more graceless than the
publican when he practised extortion? but what more full of grace when
he declared his resolution. <span id="fr_883"></span>[884](#fn_883.md)
Seest thou that thou canst not alter grace of body, for it is the result
not of moral disposition, but of nature. But grace of soul is supplied
out of our own moral choice. Thou hast now received the definition. Of
what kind are they? that the beauty of the soul proceeds from obedience
to God. For if the graceless soul obeys God it puts off its
ungracefulness, and becomes full of grace. “Saul! Saul!” it was said,
“why persecutest thou me?” and he replied “and who art Thou Lord?” “I am
Jesus.” <span id="fr_884"></span>[885](#fn_884.md) And he obeyed, and his
obedience made the graceless soul full of grace. Again, He saith to the
publican “come follow me” <span id="fr_885"></span>[886](#fn_885.md) and
the publican rose up and became an apostle: and the graceless soul
became full of grace. Whence? by obedience. Again He saith to the
fishermen “Come ye after me and I will make you to become fishers of
men:” <span id="fr_886"></span>[887](#fn_886.md) and by their obedience
their minds became full of grace. Let us see then what kind of beauty He
is speaking of here. “Hearken O daughter and behold, and forget thy own
people and thy father’s house, and the king shall desire thy beauty.”
What kind of beauty will he desire? the spiritual kind. How so? because
she is to “*forget*” He saith “hearken and forget.” These are acts of
moral choice. “Hearken!” he said: an ungraceful one hears and her
ungracefulness being that of the <span id="page_265">p. 265</span> <span
id="xv.iv-Page_265"></span>body is not removed. To the sinful woman He
has said “Hearken,” and if she will obey she sees what manner of beauty
is bestowed upon her. Since then the ungracefulness of the bride was not
physical, but moral (for she did not obey God but transgressed)
therefore he leads her to another remedy. Thou didst become ungraceful
then, not by nature, but by moral choice: and thou didst become full of
grace by obedience. “Hearken O daughter and behold and forget thy own
people, and thy father’s house, and the king shall desire thy beauty.”
Then that thou mayest learn that he does not mean anything visible to
sense, when thou hearest the word beauty, think not of eye, or nose, or
mouth, or neck, but of piety, faith, love, things which are within—“for
all the glory of the king’s daughter is from within.” Now for all these
things let us offer thanks to God, the giver, for to Him alone belongeth
glory, honour, might, for ever and ever. Amen.
