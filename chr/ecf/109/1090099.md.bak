<span id="xix.viii-p1"></span> <span id="page_381">p. 381</span> <span
id="xix.viii-Page_381"></span><span class="c17"><span
id="xix.viii-p1.1"></span>Homily VI.</span>

<span id="xix.viii-p2"></span>This Homily is intended to shew that the
fear of Magistrates is beneficial. It also contains an account of what
occurred, during their journey, to those who were conveying the tidings
of the sedition to the Emperor. The case of Jonah is further cited in
illustration. The exhortation on the fear of death is here continued;
and it is shewn, that he who suffers unjustly, and yet gives thanks to
God, by whose permission it happens, is as one suffering for God’s sake.
Examples are again adduced from the history of the Three Children, and
the Babylonian furnace. The Homily concludes with an address on the
necessity of abstaining from oaths.

<span id="xix.viii-p3"></span>1. <span class="c12"><span
id="xix.viii-p3.1"></span>We</span> have spent many days addressing
words of comfort to your Charity. We would not, however, on that account
lay the subject aside; but as long as the sore of despondency remains,
we will apply to it the medicine of consolation. For if in the case of
bodily wounds, physicians do not give over their fomentations, until
they perceive that the pain has subsided; much less ought this to be
done in regard to the soul. Despondency is a sore of the soul; and we
must therefore foment it continually with soothing words. For not so
naturally is warm water efficacious to soften a hard tumour of the
flesh, as words of comfort are powerful to allay the swelling passions
of the soul. <span id="fr_1276"></span>[1277](#fn_1276.md) Here, there is
no need of the sponge as with physician, but instead of this we employ
the tongue. No need of fire here, that we may warm the water; but
instead of fire, we make use of the grace of the Spirit. Suffer us then
to do so to-day. For if we were not to comfort you, where else could ye
obtain consolation? The judges affright; the priests therefore must
console! The rulers threaten; therefore must the Church give comfort!
Thus it happens with respect to little children. The teachers frighten
them, and send them away weeping to their mothers; but the mothers
receiving them back to their own bosoms, keep them there, embrace them,
and kiss them, while they wipe away their tears, and relieve their
sorrowing spirits; persuading them by what they say, that it is
profitable for them to fear their teachers. Since therefore the rulers
also make you afraid, and render you anxious, the Church, which is the
common mother of us all, opening her bosom, and cradling us in her arms,
administers daily consolation; telling us that the fear of rulers is
profitable, and profitable too the consolation that comes from
hence. <span id="fr_1277"></span>[1278](#fn_1277.md) For the fear of the
former does not permit us to be relaxed by listlessness, but the
consolation of the latter does not allow us to sink under the weight of
sadness; and by both these means God provides for our safety. He Himself
hath armed magistrates with power; that they may strike terror into the
licentious; and hath ordained His priests that they may administer
consolation to those that are in sorrow.

<span id="xix.viii-p6"></span>2. And both these things are taught us by
the Scripture, and by actual experience of recent events. For if, whilst
there are magistrates and soldiers living under arms, the madness of a
few individuals, a motley crew of adventurers, hath kindled such a fire
among us, in so short a moment <span
id="fr_1278"></span>[1279](#fn_1278.md) of time, and raised such a tempest,
and made us all to stand in fear of shipwreck, suppose the fear of
magistrates to be wholly taken away? To what lengths would they not have
gone in their madness? Would they not have overthrown the city from its
foundations, turning all things upside down, and have taken our very
lives? If you were to abolish the public tribunals, you would abolish
all order from our life. And even as if you deprive the ship of its
pilot, you sink the vessel; or as, if you remove the general from the
army, you place the soldiers bound in the hands of the enemy; so if you
deprive the city of its rulers, we must lead a life less rational than
that of the brutes, biting and devouring one another; the rich man, the
poorer; the stronger man, the weaker; and the bolder man, him who is
more gentle. But now by the grace of God none of these things happen.
For they who live in a state of piety, require no correction on the part
of the magistrates; for “the law is not made for a righteous man,” <span
id="fr_1279"></span>[1280](#fn_1279.md) saith one. But the more numerous
being viciously inclined, if they had no fear of these hanging over
them, would fill the cities with innumerable evils; which Paul knowing,
observed, “There is no power, but <span id="page_382">p. 382</span>
<span id="xix.viii-Page_382"></span>of God, the powers that be are
ordained of God.” <span id="fr_1280"></span>[1281](#fn_1280.md) For what
the tie-beams <span id="fr_1281"></span>[1282](#fn_1281.md) are in houses,
that rulers are in cities; and in the same manner as if you were to take
away the former, the walls, being disunited, would fall in upon one
another of their own accord; so were you to deprive the world of
magistrates, and of the fear that comes of them, houses at once, and
cities, and nations, would fall on one another in unrestrained
confusion, there being no one to repress, or repel, or persuade them to
be peaceful, by the fear of punishment!

<span id="xix.viii-p11"></span>3. Let us not then be grieved, beloved,
by the fear of our rulers, but let us give thanks to God that He hath
removed our listlessness, and rendered us more diligent. For tell me,
what harm hath arisen from this concern and anxiety? Is it that we are
become more grave, and gentle; more diligent, and attentive? that we see
no one intoxicated, and singing lascivious airs? Or is it that there are
continual supplications, <span id="fr_1282"></span>[1283](#fn_1282.md) and
prayers, and tears? that unseasonable laughter, and impure words, and
all dissoluteness is banished; and that the city is now in all respects,
like the pattern of a modest and virtuous woman? Dost thou grieve, I
ask, for any of these reasons? For these things, assuredly, it were
right to rejoice, and to be thankful to God, that by the terror of a few
days He hath put an end to such stupidity!

<span id="xix.viii-p13"></span>“Very true,” saith some one, “if our
danger did not go beyond fear, we should have reaped a sufficient
benefit; but we are now in dread lest the mischief should proceed much
farther, and we should be all placed in the extremest peril.”

<span id="xix.viii-p14"></span>Nevertheless, I say, fear not. Paul
comforteth you, saying, “God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be
tempted above that ye are able, but will with the temptation also make
the way of escape, that ye may be able to bear it.” <span
id="fr_1283"></span>[1284](#fn_1283.md) He indeed Himself hath said, “I
will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.” <span
id="fr_1284"></span>[1285](#fn_1284.md) For had He resolved to punish us in
deed, and in actual endurance, He would not have given us over to terror
during so many days. For when He would not punish, He affrights; since
if He were intending to punish, fear would be superfluous, and
threatening superfluous. But now, we have sustained a life more grievous
than countless deaths; fearing and trembling during so many days, and
being suspicious of our very shadows; and paying the punishment of Cain;
and in the midst of our sleep, starting up, through constant agony of
mind. So that if we have kindled God’s wrath, we have appeased Him in
the endurance of such a punishment. For if we have not paid the
satisfaction due to our sins, yet it hath been enough to satisfy the
mercy of God.

<span id="xix.viii-p17"></span>4. But not this, but many other grounds
for confidence ought we to have. For God hath already given us not a few
pledges for favourable hopes. And first of all, those who carried the
evil tidings departing hence with the speed of wings, supposing they
should long ere this have reached the camp, <span
id="fr_1285"></span>[1286](#fn_1285.md) are yet delayed in the midst of
their journey. So many hindrances and impediments have arisen; and they
have left their horses, and are now proceeding in vehicles; whence their
arrival must of necessity be retarded. For since God here stirred up our
priest, and common father, and persuaded him to go forth, and undertake
this embassy, he detained the messengers for a while, when they were but
half way on their road, lest arriving before him they might kindle the
fire, and make our teacher’s efforts to mend matters useless, when the
royal ears had become inflamed. For that this hindrance on the road, was
not without God’s interposition is evident from this. Men who had been
familiar with such journeys all their lives, and whose constant business
it was to ride on horseback, now broke down through the fatigue of this
very riding; so that what hath now happened is the reverse of what took
place in the case of Jonah. For God hastened him when unwilling, to go
on his mission. But these, who were desirous to go, He hindered. O
strange and wonderful event! He wished not to preach of an overthrow;
and God forced him to go <span id="fr_1286"></span>[1287](#fn_1286.md)
against his will. These men with much haste set forward to be the
bearers of a message of overthrow, and against their will again He has
hindered them! For what reason think you? Why, because in this case the
haste was an injury; but in the other case, haste brought gain. On this
account, He hastened him forward by means of the whale; and detained
these by means of their horses. Seest thou the wisdom of God? Through
the very means by which each party hoped to accomplish their object,
through these each received an hindrance. Jonah expected to <span
id="page_383">p. 383</span> <span id="xix.viii-Page_383"></span>escape
by the ship, and the ship became his chain. These couriers, by means of
their horses, expected the more quickly to see the Emperor; and the
horses became the obstacles; or rather, neither the horses in one case,
nor the ship in the other, but the Providence of God everywhere
directing all things according to its own wisdom!

<span id="xix.viii-p20"></span>5. Consider also His care over us, and
how He both affrighted and consoled us. For after permitting them to set
out on the very day when all these outrages were committed, as if they
would report all that had taken place to the Emperor; He alarmed us all
at their sudden departure. But when they were gone, and two or three
days had elapsed, and we thought the journey of our Priest would now be
useless, as he would arrive when it was too late, He delivered us from
this fear, and comforted us by detaining them, as I observed, midway;
and by providing persons coming to us from thence by the same road, to
announce to us all the difficulties they had met with on their journey,
that we might thus take a little breath, as indeed we did, and were
relieved of a great part of our anxiety. Having heard of this, we adored
God who had done it, who hath even now more tenderly than any father
disposed all things for us, delaying by some invisible power those evil
messengers, and all but saying to them, “Why do ye hasten? Why do ye
press on, when ye are going to overwhelm so great a city? For are ye the
bearers of a good message to the Emperor? Wait there till I have made
ready my servant, as an excellent physician, to come up with you and
anticipate you in your course.” But if there was so much of providential
care in the first breaking out of this wound of iniquity, much more
shall we obtain a greater freedom from anxiety, after conversion, after
repentance, after so much fear, after tears and prayers. For Jonah was
very properly constrained, in order that he might be forcibly brought to
repentance; but ye have already given striking evidences of repentance,
and conversion. Therefore, it is necessary that you should receive
consolation, instead of a threatening messenger. For this reason also
hath He sent our common father hence, notwithstanding the many things to
hinder it. But if He had not been tender of our safety, He would not
have persuaded him to this, but would have hindered him, however
disposed he might be to undertake the journey.

<span id="xix.viii-p21"></span>6. There is a third reason by which I may
possibly persuade you to have confidence; I mean, the present sacred
season, <span id="fr_1287"></span>[1288](#fn_1287.md) which almost all,
even unbelievers, respect; but to which this our divinely-favoured
Emperor has shewn such reverence and honour, as to surpass all the
Emperors who have reigned with a regard for religion before him. As a
proof of this, by sending a letter on these days in honour of the feast,
he liberated nearly all those who were lodged in prison; and this letter
our Priest when he arrives will read to him; and remind him of his own
laws, and will say to him, “Do thou exhort thyself, and remember thine
own deeds! Thou hast an example for thy philanthropy at home! Thou didst
choose to forbear from executing a justifiable slaughter, and wilt thou
endure to perpetrate one that is unjust. Reverencing the feast, thou
didst discharge those who had been convicted and condemned; and wilt
thou, I ask, condemn the innocent, and those who have not committed any
violence, and this when the sacred season is present? That be far from
thee, O Emperor! Thou, speaking by this Epistle to all the cities, didst
say, ‘Would it were possible for me to raise even the dead.’ This
philanthropy and these words we now stand in need of. To conquer
enemies, doth not render kings so illustrious, as to conquer wrath and
anger; for in the former case, the success is due to arms and soldiers;
but here the trophy is simply thine own, and thou hast no one to divide
with thee the glory of thy moral wisdom. Thou hast overcome barbarian
war, overcome also Imperial wrath! Let all unbelievers learn that the
fear of Christ is able to bridle every kind of authority. Glorify thy
Lord by forgiving the trespasses of thy fellow-servants; that He also
may glorify thee the more; that at the Day of Judgment, He may bend on
thee an Eye merciful and serene, being mindful of this thy
lovingkindness!” This, and much more, he will say, and will assuredly
rescue us from the Emperor’s wrath. And not only will this fast be of
the greatest assistance to us in influencing the Emperor in our favour,
but also towards enduring what befalls us with fortitude; for we reap no
small consolation from this season. For our very meeting together daily
as we do, and having the benefit of hearing the divine Scriptures; and
beholding each other; and weeping with each other; and praying, and
receiving Benedictions, <span id="fr_1288"></span>[1289](#fn_1288.md) and
so <span id="page_384">p. 384</span> <span
id="xix.viii-Page_384"></span>departing home, takes off the chief part
of our distress.

<span id="xix.viii-p24"></span>7. Let us, therefore, not despond, nor
give ourselves up by reason of our distress; but let us wait, expecting
a favourable issue; and let us give heed to the things that are now
about to be spoken. For it is my purpose to discourse to you again to
day respecting contempt for death. I said to you, yesterday, that we are
afraid of death, not because he is really formidable; but because the
love of the kingdom hath not kindled us, nor the fear of hell laid hold
of us; and because besides this we have not a good conscience. Are you
desirous that I should speak of a fourth reason for this unseasonable
distress, one which is not less, <span
id="fr_1289"></span>[1290](#fn_1289.md) and truer than the rest? We do not
live with the austerity that becometh Christians. On the contrary, we
love to follow this voluptuous and dissolute and indolent life;
therefore also it is but natural that we cleave to present things; since
if we spent this life in fastings, vigils, and poverty of diet, cutting
off all our extravagant desires; setting a restraint upon our pleasures;
undergoing the toils of virtue; keeping the body under <span
id="fr_1290"></span>[1291](#fn_1290.md) like Paul, and bringing it into
subjection; not “making provision for the lusts of the flesh;” <span
id="fr_1291"></span>[1292](#fn_1291.md) and pursuing the strait and narrow
way, we should soon be earnestly desirous of future things, and eager to
be delivered from our present labours. And to prove that what I say is
not untrue, ascend to the tops of the mountains, and observe the monks
who are there; some in sackcloth; some in bonds; some in fastings; some
shut up <span id="fr_1292"></span>[1293](#fn_1292.md) in darkness. Thou
wilt then perceive, that all these are earnestly desiring death, and
calling it rest. For even as the pugilist is eager to leave the stadium,
in order that he may be freed from wounds; and the wrestler longs for
the theatre to break up, that he may be released from his toils; so also
he who by the aid of virtue leads a life of austerity, and
mortification, earnestly longs for death in order that he may be freed
from his present labours, and may be able to have full assurance in
regard to the crowns laid up in store, by arriving in the still harbour,
and migrating to the place where there is no further apprehension of
shipwreck. Therefore, also, hath God provided for us a life that is
naturally laborious and troublesome; to the end that being here urged by
tribulation, we may conceive an eager longing for future blessings; for
if now, whilst there are so many sorrows, and dangers, and fears, and
anxieties, surrounding us on all sides, we thus cling to the present
life; when should we ever be desirous of the life to come, if our
present existence were altogether void of grief and misery?

<span id="xix.viii-p29"></span>8. Thus also God acted towards the Jews.
For wishing to infuse into them a desire of returning (to Canaan), and
to persuade them to hate Egypt, He permitted them to be distressed by
working in clay, and brick-making, that being oppressed by that weight
of toil and affliction, they might cry unto God respecting their return.
For if, indeed when they departed after these things had happened, they
did again remember Egypt, with their hard slavery, and were urgent to
turn back to that former tyranny; what if they had received no such
treatment from these barbarians? when would they have ever wished to
leave that strange land? <span id="fr_1293"></span>[1294](#fn_1293.md) To
the end, therefore, that we may not be too closely attached to the
earth, and grow wretched whilst gaping after present things, and become
unmindful of futurity, God hath made our lives here full of labour. Let
us not then cherish the love of the present life beyond what is
necessary. For what doth it profit us? or what is the advantage of being
closely rivetted to the desire of this present state? Art thou willing
to learn in what respect this life is advantageous? It is so, inasmuch
as it is the ground-work and starting point of the life to come; the
wrestling-school and the arena for crowns of victory hereafter! so that
if it does not provide these for us, it is worse than a thousand deaths.
For if we do not wish to live so as to please God, it is better to die.
For what is the gain? What have we the more? Do we not every day see the
same sun, and the same moon, the same winter, the same summer, the same
course of things? “The thing that hath been, shall be; and that which is
done, is that which shall be done.” <span
id="fr_1294"></span>[1295](#fn_1294.md) Let us not then at once pronounce
those happy, who are alive, and <span id="page_385">p. 385</span> <span
id="xix.viii-Page_385"></span>bewail the dead, but let us weep for those
who are in their sins, whether they be dead or alive. And on the other
hand, let us call those happy in whatsoever condition they be, who are
in a state of righteousness. Thou, forsooth, fearest and lamentest “one”
death; but Paul, who was dying daily, <span
id="fr_1295"></span>[1296](#fn_1295.md) was so far from shedding a tear on
that account, that he rejoiced and exulted!

<span id="xix.viii-p33"></span>9. “O that I did endure the peril for
God,” saith some one, “then I should have no anxiety!” But do not even
now sink into despondency; for not only indeed is he well approved, who
suffers in the cause of God: but he who is suffering any thing
unjustly: <span id="fr_1296"></span>[1297](#fn_1296.md) and bearing it
nobly, and giving thanks to God who permits it, is not inferior to him
who sustains these trials for God’s sake. The blessed Job is a proof of
this, who received so many intolerable wounds through the devil’s
plotting against him uselessly, vainly, and without cause. Yet,
nevertheless, because he bore them courageously, and gave thanks to God
who permitted them, he was invested with a perfect <span
id="fr_1297"></span>[1298](#fn_1297.md) crown. Be not sad then on account
of death; for it is natural to die: but grieve for sin; because it is a
fault of the will. But if thou grievest for the dead, mourn also for
those who are born into the world; for as the one thing is of nature, so
is the other too of nature. Should any one, therefore, threaten thee
with death, say to him, “I am instructed by Christ not to ‘fear them
which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul.’” <span
id="fr_1298"></span>[1299](#fn_1298.md) Or should he threaten thee with the
confiscation of thy goods, say to him, “Naked came I out of my mother’s
womb, and naked shall I return thither. We brought nothing into this
world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out.” <span
id="fr_1299"></span>[1300](#fn_1299.md) “And though thou take me not, death
will come and take me; and though thou slay me not, yet the law of
nature will presently interfere and bring the end.” Therefore we should
fear none of these things which are brought on us by the order of
nature, but those which are engendered by our own evil will; for these
bring forth our penalty. But let us continually consider this, that as
regards the events which come upon us unexpectedly we shall not mend
them by grieving, and so we shall cease to grieve.

<span id="xix.viii-p38"></span>10. And moreover we should think of this
again, that if we suffer any evil unjustly, during the present life, we
discharge a multitude of sins. Therefore it is a great advantage to have
out the chastisement of our sins here, and not there; for the rich man
received no evil here, and therefore he was scorched in the flames
there; and that this was the reason why he did not enjoy any
consolation, <span id="fr_1300"></span>[1301](#fn_1300.md) hear in proof
what Abraham saith, “Son, thou hast received thy good things; therefore
thou art tormented.” But that to the good things bestowed on Lazarus,
not only his virtue, but his having here suffered a thousand ills,
contributed, learn also from the patriarch’s words. For having said to
the rich man, “Thou hast received <span
id="fr_1301"></span>[1302](#fn_1301.md) thy good things,” he goes on to
say, “and Lazarus evil things, and for this reason he is
comforted.” <span id="fr_1302"></span>[1303](#fn_1302.md) For as they who
live virtuously, and are afflicted, receive a double reward from God, so
he who liveth in wickedness, and fares sumptuously, shall have a double
punishment. Again, I declare this not for the purpose of accusing those
who have taken flight, for it is said, “Add not more trouble to a heart
that is vexed;” <span id="fr_1303"></span>[1304](#fn_1303.md) nor do I say
it because I wish to rebuke; (for the sick man stands in need of
consolation); but for the purpose of endeavouring to promote an
amendment. Let us not entrust our safety to flight, but flee from sins,
and depart from our evil way. If we escape from these things, although
we be in the midst of ten thousand soldiers; not one of them will be
able to smite us; but not flying from these, though we ascend to the
very summit of the mountains, we shall there find innumerable enemies!
Let us again call to mind those three children, who were in the midst of
the furnace, yet suffered no evil, and those who cast them into it, how
they that sat around were all consumed. What is more wonderful than
this? The fire freed those it held possession of, and violently seized
those whom it did not hold, to teach thee, that not the habitation, but
the habit of life, bringeth safety or punishment. Those within the
furnace escaped, but those without were consumed. To each alike were the
same bodies, but not the same dispositions. <span
id="fr_1304"></span>[1305](#fn_1304.md) For this reason neither were the
effects on them the same; for hay, although it lie without the flame, is
quickly kindled; but gold, although it remain within, becomes the more
resplendent!

<span id="xix.viii-p44"></span>11. Where now are those who said, “Let
the Emperor take all, and grant us our bodies free?” Let such go and
learn what is a free body. It is not immunity from <span
id="page_386">p. 386</span> <span
id="xix.viii-Page_386"></span>punishment that makes the body free, but
perseverance in a life of righteousness. The bodies of these youths, for
instance, were free, though they were given over to the furnace, because
they had before put off the slavery of sin. For this alone is liberty;
and not an immunity from punishment, or from suffering anything fearful.
But having heard of the furnace, call thou to mind the “rivers of
fire,” <span id="fr_1305"></span>[1306](#fn_1305.md) which there shall be
in that fearful day. For as on the above occasion, the fire seized upon
some, but reverenced others, so also shall it be with those rivers. If
any one should then have hay, wood, stubble, he increases <span
id="fr_1306"></span>[1307](#fn_1306.md) the fire; but if he has gold and
silver, he <span id="fr_1307"></span>[1308](#fn_1307.md) becomes the
brighter. Let us therefore get together this kind of material, and let
us bear the present state of things nobly; knowing that this tribulation
will both bring us deliverance from that punishment if we understand how
to practise true wisdom, <span id="fr_1308"></span>[1309](#fn_1308.md) and
will also make us better here; and not only us, but often those too, who
throw us into trouble, if we be vigilant; so abundant is the force of
this spiritual wisdom; which was the case then even with the tyrant. For
when he knew that they had suffered no harm, hear how he changed his
language. “Ye servants of the most high God, come forth, and come
hither.” <span id="fr_1309"></span>[1310](#fn_1309.md) Didst not thou say,
a little before “Who is that God that shall deliver you out of my
hands?” <span id="fr_1310"></span>[1311](#fn_1310.md) What hath happened?
Whence this change? Thou sawest those without destroyed, and dost thou
call on those within? Whence hath it come to pass that thou art grown
wise in such matters. Thou seest how great a change took place in the
monarch! Whilst he had not yet exercised his power over them, he
blasphemed, but as soon as he had cast them into fire, he began to shew
moral wisdom. For this reason also God permitted all to take place,
whatsoever the tyrant wished, in order that He might make it manifest,
that none will be able to injure those who are kept by Him. And what He
did towards Job, He performed here. For on that occasion also, He
permitted the devil to manifest all his power; and not till he had
exhausted all his darts, and no further mode of plotting against him
remained, was the combatant led out of the field, that the victory might
be brilliant and indubitable. So here too He did the very same thing. He
willed to overthrow their city, and God stayed him not: he willed to
carry them away captive, and He hindered him not: he willed to bind
them, and He permitted; to cast them into the furnace, and He allowed
it: to heat the flame beyond its measure, and this too He suffered; and
when there was nothing further left for the tyrant to do, and he had
exhausted all his strength, then God manifested His own power, and the
patience of the youths. Seest thou how God permitted these tribulations
even to the end, that He might shew the assailants the spiritual wisdom
of those whom they assailed, as well as His own providence. Both of
which circumstances also that man then discerned, and cried out, “Ye
servants of the most high God, come forth, and come hither.”

<span id="xix.viii-p51"></span>12. But consider thou with me the
magnanimity of the youths; for they neither sprang out before the call,
lest some should suppose they feared the fire; nor when they were called
did they remain within, lest any one should think that they were
ambitious and contentious. “As soon,” say they, “as thou hast learnt
whose servants we are, as soon as thou hast acknowledged our Lord, we
come forth to be heralds to all who are present of the power of God.” Or
rather, not only they themselves, but even the enemy with his own voice,
yea, both orally, and by his epistle, proclaimed to all men both the
constancy of the combatants, and the strength of Him who presided over
the contest. And even as the heralds, when they proclaim the names of
the victorious combatants in the midst of the theatre, mention also the
cities to which they belong; “such an one, of such a city!” So he too,
instead of their city, proclaimed their Lord, by saying, “Shadrach,
Meshach, and Abednego, ye servants of the most high God, come forth, and
come hither.” What is come to pass, that thou callest them the servants
of God? Were they not thy servants? “Yea,” saith he, “but they have
overthrown <span id="fr_1311"></span>[1312](#fn_1311.md) my sovereignty;
they have trampled under foot my pride. They have shown by deeds, that
He is their true Lord. If they were the servants of men, the fire would
not have feared them; the flame would not have made way for them; for
the creation knows nothing of reverencing or honoring the servants of
men.” Therefore again he saith, “Blessed be the God of Shadrach,
Meshach, and Abednego.”

<span id="xix.viii-p53"></span><span id="page_387">p. 387</span> <span
id="xix.viii-Page_387"></span>13. Contemplate with me also, how first he
proclaims the Arbiter of the contest. “Blessed be God, who hath sent His
angel and delivered His servants.” <span
id="fr_1312"></span>[1313](#fn_1312.md) This of the power of God. He speaks
also of the virtue of the combatants. “Because they trusted in Him, and
have changed the king’s word, and have yielded their bodies, that they
might not worship any god except their own God.” Could anything equal
the virtue of this? Before this, when they said, “We will not serve thy
gods,” he was inflamed more fiercely than the very furnace; but now,
when by their deeds they had taught him this, he was so far from being
indignant, that he praised and admired them, for not having obeyed him!
So good a thing is virtue, that it has even its enemies themselves to
applaud and admire it! These had fought and conquered, but the
vanquished party gave thanks, that the sight of the fire had not
terrified them, but that the hope in their Lord had comforted them. And
He names the God of the whole world after the three youths, not at all
circumscribing His sovereignty, but inasmuch as these three youths were
equivalent to the whole world. <span
id="fr_1313"></span>[1314](#fn_1313.md) For this reason he both applauds
those who had despised him, and passing by so many governors, kings, and
princes, those who had obeyed him, he stands in admiration of the three
captives and slaves, who derided his tyranny! For they did these things,
not for the sake of contention, but for the love of wisdom; not of
defiance, but of devotion; not as being puffed up with pride, but fired
with zeal. For great indeed is the blessing of a hope in God; which then
also the barbarian learned, and making it manifest that it was from that
source they had escaped the impending peril, he exclaimed aloud:
“Because they trusted in Him!” <span
id="fr_1314"></span>[1315](#fn_1314.md)

<span id="xix.viii-p57"></span>14. But I say all this now, and select
all the histories that contain trials and tribulations, and the wrath of
kings, and their evil designs, in order that we may fear nothing, save
only offending God. For then also was there a furnace burning; yet they
derided it, but feared sin. For they knew that if they were consumed in
the fire, they should suffer nothing that was to be dreaded; but that if
they were guilty of impiety, they should undergo the extremes of misery.
It is the greatest punishment to commit sin, though we may remain
unpunished; as on the other hand, it is the greatest honour and repose
to live virtuously, though we may be punished. For sins separate us from
God; as He Himself speaks; “Have not your sins separated between you and
Me?” <span id="fr_1315"></span>[1316](#fn_1315.md) But punishments lead us
back to God. As one saith, “Give peace; for Thou hast recompensed us for
all things.” <span id="fr_1316"></span>[1317](#fn_1316.md) Suppose any one
hath a wound; which is the most deserving of fear, gangrene, or the
surgeon’s knife? the steel, or the devouring progress of the ulcer? Sin
is a gangrene, punishment is the surgeon’s knife. As then, he who hath a
gangrene, although he is not lanced, hath to sustain the malady, and is
then in the worse condition, when he is not lanced; so also the sinner,
though he be not punished, is the most wretched of men; and is then
especially wretched, when he hath no punishment, and is suffering no
distress. And as those who have a disease of the spleen, or a dropsy,
when they enjoy a plentiful table, and cool drinks, and a variety of
delicacies, and condiments, are then especially in a most pitiable
state, increasing as they do their disease by luxury; but should they
rigorously subject themselves to hunger and thirst, according to medical
laws, they might have some hope of recovery; so also those who live in
iniquity, if they are punished, may have favourable hopes; but if,
together with their wickedness, they enjoy security and luxury, they
become more wretched than those who cram their bellies, though they are
in a state of dropsy; and so much the more, as the soul is better than
the body. If then thou seest any who are in the same sins, and some of
them struggling continually with hunger, and a thousand ills; while
others are drinking their fill, and living sumptuously, and
gormandizing; think those the better off, who endure sufferings. For not
only is the flame of voluptuousness cut off by these misfortunes, but
they also depart to the future Judgment, and that dread tribunal, <span
id="fr_1317"></span>[1318](#fn_1317.md) with no small relief; and go hence,
<span id="page_388">p. 388</span> <span
id="xix.viii-Page_388"></span>having discharged here the penalty of the
greater part of their sins by the ills they have suffered.

<span id="xix.viii-p61"></span>15. But enough of consolation. It is time
for us now, at last, to proceed to the exhortation on the subject of
avoiding oaths, and to remove that seeming palliation on behalf of those
who swear, which is but futile, <span
id="fr_1318"></span>[1319](#fn_1318.md) and useless. For when we bring an
accusation against them, they allege the case of others who do the very
same thing; and they say, “such and such persons swear.” Let us then say
to these, Nevertheless; such a man does not swear: and God will give His
judgment concerning thee, from those who do good works; for sinners do
not profit sinners by fellowship in transgressions; but they who perform
what is right condemn sinners. <span
id="fr_1319"></span>[1320](#fn_1319.md) For they who gave not Christ food,
or drink, were many; but they rendered no aid to each other. <span
id="fr_1320"></span>[1321](#fn_1320.md) Similar also was the case of the
five virgins, who found no pardon from companionship, <span
id="fr_1321"></span>[1322](#fn_1321.md) but being condemned by a comparison
with those who had acted wisely, both these and the former were alike
punished.

<span id="xix.viii-p66"></span>16. Dismissing then this argument of
frigid self-deception, let us not look at the case of those who fall,
but at those who fashion their conduct rightly; and let us endeavour to
carry along with us a memento of the present fast when it is over. And
as it often happens when we have purchased a vestment, or a slave, or a
precious vase, we recall again the time when we did so, and say to each
other, “That slave I purchased at such a festival; that garment I bought
at such a time;” so, in like manner, if we now reduce to practice this
law, we shall say, I reformed the practice of swearing during that Lent;
for till then I was a swearer; but from barely hearing an admonition, I
have abstained from the sin.

<span id="xix.viii-p67"></span>But “the custom,” it may be objected, “is
a hard thing to be reformed.” I know it is; and therefore am urgent to
throw you into another custom, which is good and profitable. For when
you say, it is difficult for me to abstain from what is habitual; for
that very reason, I say, you should make haste to abstain, knowing for
certain, that if you once <span id="fr_1322"></span>[1323](#fn_1322.md)
make another custom for yourself of not swearing, you will want no
labour afterwards. Which is the more difficult thing; not to swear, or
to remain the whole day without food; and to shrivel up <span
id="fr_1323"></span>[1324](#fn_1323.md) on water-drinking, and meagre diet?
It is evident that the latter surpasses the former; yet,
notwithstanding, custom has made this matter so possible and easy of
execution, that when the fast comes round, although any one should
exhort a thousand times, or as frequently constrain and compel one to
partake of wine, or taste of any other of those things which are
forbidden during fasts, yet a man would prefer to suffer anything,
rather than touch the prohibited article of food; <span
id="fr_1324"></span>[1325](#fn_1324.md) and that not for want of relish for
the table, nevertheless, we bear it all with fortitude, from the habit
of our conscience. And the case will be the same in regard to oaths; and
just as if now, any one were to impose ever so great necessity, you
would remain immovable, holding fast the habit; <span
id="fr_1325"></span>[1326](#fn_1325.md) so also in that case, if any one
should urge you ten thousand times, you would not depart from your
custom.

<span id="xix.viii-p72"></span>18. When you go home, therefore,
discourse of all these things with those who are in your house; and as
many persons often do, when they come back from a meadow, having plucked
there a rose, or a violet, or some flower of that kind, they return
twisting <span id="fr_1326"></span>[1327](#fn_1326.md) it about with their
fingers; and as some, again, when they quit the gardens to go home, take
with them branches of trees, with their fruit upon them; and as others,
moreover, from sumptuous feasts, carry away leavings of the
entertainment for their dependents; so indeed do thou, departing from
hence, take an exhortation home to thy wife, thy children, and all thine
household. For this admonition is more profitable than the meadow, the
garden, or the banquetting table. These roses never wither; these fruits
never drop off; these dainties never corrupt. The former yield a
temporary delight; but the latter a lasting advantage, not only after
this reformation has taken place, but in the very act of reforming. For
think what a good practice this would be, having dismissed all other
matters public or private, to discourse <span
id="fr_1327"></span>[1328](#fn_1327.md) <span id="page_389">p. 389</span>
<span id="xix.viii-Page_389"></span>only of the divine laws continually,
at the table, in the forum, and in your other meetings. Would we give
our attention to these things, we should say nothing of a dangerous or
injurious nature, nor should we sin unwittingly. Giving our leisure to
discourse respecting these things, we should be able to withdraw our
soul even from this despondency that hangs over us, instead of looking
with so much anxiety as we do, whilst we say one to another, “Hath the
Emperor heard what hath happened? Is he incensed? What sentence hath he
pronounced? <span id="fr_1328"></span>[1329](#fn_1328.md) Hath any one
petitioned him? What? Will he himself endure to destroy utterly a city
so great and populous?” Casting these and all such cares upon God, let
us be anxious only as to what He hath commanded! Thus shall we rid
ourselves of all these sorrows; and although ten only among us should
succeed, the ten would quickly become twenty; the twenty fifty; the
fifty a hundred; the hundred a thousand; the thousand all the city. And
just as when ten lamps are lighted, one may easily fill the whole house
with light, so also with respect to right actions; should only ten act
rightly, we shall light up a general flame throughout the city, to shine
forth, and to procure us safety. For not so naturally does the fire,
when it falls upon a forest, kindle the neighbouring trees successively,
as will the emulation for virtue, when it seizes upon a few minds, be
mighty in its progress to diffuse itself through the whole community.

<span id="xix.viii-p76"></span>19. Give me cause, then, to exult over
you both in the present life, and at that future Day, when those to whom
talents have been entrusted, shall be summoned! Your good reputation is
a sufficient reward for my labours; and if I see you living in piety, I
have all I wish. Do, then, what yesterday I recommended, and to-day will
repeat, and will not cease to say it. Fix a penalty for those who swear;
a penalty which is a gain, and not a loss; and prepare yourselves
henceforth so as you may give us a proof of success. For I shall
endeavour to hold a long conversation with each of you, when this
assembly is dismissed; in order that in the continuance of discourse I
may discover the persons who have been acting rightly, and those who
have not. <span id="fr_1329"></span>[1330](#fn_1329.md) And if I find any
one still swearing, I shall make him manifest to all who are amended,
that by reproving, rebuking, and correcting, we may quickly deliver him
from this evil habit. For better it is that he should amend through
being reproached here, than that he should be put to shame, and
punished, in the presence of the whole assembled universe, on that Day,
when our sins shall be revealed to the eyes of all men! But God forbid
that any in this fair assembly should appear there suffering such
things! but by the prayers of the holy fathers, <span
id="fr_1330"></span>[1331](#fn_1330.md) correcting all our offences, and
hav<span id="page_390">p. 390</span> <span
id="xix.viii-Page_390"></span>ing shown forth the abundant fruit of
virtue, may we depart hence with much confidence, through the grace and
lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom, and with whom, be
glory to the Father together with the Holy Spirit, for ever and ever.
Amen.

<span id="xix.viii-p18"></span> τὸ στρατόπεδον. The common Lexicons
quote only Can. 7, of Sardica for the use of this word, to signify the
court of an Emperor. Due Cange, *Gloss. Med. Gr*., shews it to be
common, quoting St. Basil, Ep. 127<span id="xix.viii-p18.1"></span>, al.
59, &c.; St. Athanasius, *Apol. ad Constantium*, c. 4, St. Macar. Hom.
XV. p. 213 (1st ed.) sec. 30, and other passages. The term is accounted
for by the acknowledged dependence of the Emperors on the army, and
their constantly having a strong guard about them. Compare our
expression, “head-quarters” to denote the seat of government. Theodosius
was now at Constantinople.

<span id="xix.viii-p22"></span> Tillemont, *Theodos*. art. vi., mentions
a law of his against holding criminal processes in Lent, and one
deferring all executions thirty days. The massacre of Thessalonica, for
which St. Ambrose caused him to do penance, occurred after the date of
these Homilies, and that event forms a striking comment on Hom. III. 6.
St. Ambrose then required him to renew the last-mentioned law.

<span id="xix.viii-p23"></span> εὐλογίας. This word, rendered
*benedictionem* by the Latin translator, meant according to Bingham the
very same as the Eucharist in the more ancient writers, and is always so
applied by Cyril of Alexandria, and Chrysostom. In after times, he
further observes, that this term was applied to portions of bread
blessed, but distinct from the Eucharist (being the residue of that
brought for consecration), which was given to those who were not
prepared to communicate, b. xv., c. iv., sec. 3, vol. v., p. 155, new
Ed. The term was evidently derived from the Apostolic phraseology, τὸ
ποτήριον τῆς εὐλογίας, [1 Cor. x.
16](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#016.md)<span id="xix.viii-p23.1"></span>.
It is used in the plural, for portions of the consecrated bread, both at
communion, and when reserved to be sent to the sick, or to other
churches.

<span id="xix.viii-p25"></span> M. (and Ben. and Bas. Tr. apparently)

<span id="xix.viii-p26"></span> ὑπωπι€ζων, the same word as used by St.
Paul, [1 Cor. ix. 27](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#027.md)<span
id="xix.viii-p26.1"></span>, which alludes to the bruising of the face,
or the parts under the eye, in the Greek games of boxing. Some read
ὑποπι™ζων, “pressing down,” as indeed do some copies of the text and
commentators, and among them St. Chrysostom *ad loc*., but this has less
authority in its favor.

<span id="xix.viii-p28"></span> This word may perhaps belong to the
whole series of penances. St. Chrysostom is not recommending such
austerities at all, but urging them to imitate in some measure a life
which they already honored and esteemed holy. See on [Rom. xiv.

<span id="xix.viii-p60"></span> It was the common opinion of the Greek
Fathers, that the fire of the day of judgment would cause severe
suffering to some of those who would be finally saved, and that this
might be mitigated by a severe repentance, and in some degree by
suffering here, and by the prayers of others. St. Chrys. on [Phil. i.
24](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#024.md)<span id="xix.viii-p60.1"></span>;
Hom. III. Mor. Orig. on [Ps.
xxxvi.](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#000.md)<span
id="xix.viii-p60.2"></span> (al. xxxvii.) v. 8; Ben. ii. 661, D.; St.
Cyr. *Catech*. xv. (9); Greg. Nyss. *Or. de Mort*. ed. 1638, t. iii.
634, d. speaks of a cleansing fire. But in *Or. de fun. Pulcheriæ*, p.
460, he says, “Such a soul, having nothing for which to be judged, fears
not *Hell*, dreads not *Judgment*. It abides free from fear and
astonishment, no evil conscience causing a fear of *Judgment*.” However,
St. Chrys. on [1 Cor. iii. 15](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#015.md)<span
id="xix.viii-p60.3"></span>, Hom. IX. explains the being *saved as by
fire* of remaining undestroyed in eternal torment. This last exposition
is attributed to “the Greeks” by Bellarmine, *de Purg*. lib. i. c. 5,
having been defended by them in the discussion on Purgatory preliminary
to the Council of Florence. Labbe, t. xiii. p. 26–30. It is also held by
Photius, Œcum. *ad loc*. Theodoret, on [1 Cor.
iii.](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#000.md)<span id="xix.viii-p60.4"></span>,
takes the passage in general to refer to teachers and their work as
such, but explains the words cited of a fiery trial of the teacher’s own
life. Euseb. (quoted as Emisen. really a Gall. Bp. of later date),
*Bibl. Pat. Col*. iii. 549, speaks of rivers of fire (see p. 126); Hom.
III. *de Epiph*., Œcumenius on [1 Cor.
iii.](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#000.md)<span id="xix.viii-p60.5"></span>
(doubtfully). Also the Commentary on Isaiah, attributed to St. Basil, on
c. ix. 19; Ben. t. i. p. 554 (cited as his by Photius), speak of a
cleansing by the Judgment fire. Origen, on [Ps.
xxxvi.](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#000.md)<span
id="xix.viii-p60.6"></span> (37) 14, Hom. III. 1, says, “And, as I
think, we must all come to that fire. Though one be Paul or Peter, yet
he comes to that fire.” So St. Ambr. on verse 15, sec. 26, of Ezekiel
and Daniel, and St. Hil. on [Ps.
cxviii.](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#000.md)<span

Tr. p. 104, note e. St. Greg. Naz. *Or*. xxxix. c. 19, speaks of
Novatians, as “perhaps to be baptized in the fire of the other world, in
that last Baptism, which is longer and more painful.” There is no
minutely defined and universal doctrine on the subject. See on Fleury,

id="xix.viii-p78.1"></span>, Hom. XXXII., where the translation perhaps
ought to be, “These imitators of Paul. Only let us yield ourselves
worthy of such intercession.” This rendering is confirmed by its
agreement with Hom. XLIV. on [Gen. xix.
29](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#029.md)<span id="xix.viii-p78.2"></span>;
Ben. iv. 448, 449. But there is a difficulty in it owing to the
reference to St. Paul’s *departure*. This may be explained as a turn of
rhetoric. The passage on [Gen.
xix.](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#000.md)<span id="xix.viii-p78.3"></span>
does not define whether saints on earth or above are spoken of; but from
others it is probable he means the latter. The close of the Homily on
St. Meletius, Ben. ii. 522, A. speaks of such intercession, and that of
Hom. *in SS. Bernicen and Prosd*. Ben. ii. 645, D. of invoking it. The
Homily quoted above, on the intercession of Abraham, warns men against
trusting to prayers of saints so as to neglect their own life. An
expression like that in the text occurs in a Homily *de Sp. Sancto*,
attributed to St. Chrys. by Photius, Ben. iii. 799, C.; Origen on [Cant.
ii. 5](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#005.md)<span
id="xix.viii-p78.4"></span>, asserts the intercession of the saints,
proving it from [2 Mac. xv. 14](../../../bib/apo/ma2015.htm#014.md)<span
id="xix.viii-p78.5"></span>, and on [Numb.
xxxii.](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#000.md)<span
id="xix.viii-p78.6"></span>, Hom. XXVI. 6, he asks, who doubts it? Hom.
I. 7, on Ezekiel, he invokes an angel, as holding that angels are
present, though in a rhetorical way. Lib. 2, in Job (fin.) sometimes
cited as his, is spurious, and the Com. on Lament. doubtful, and the
manner of invocation looks as if of later date. St. Cyprian, *Ep*. 57,
*ad Cornel. fin*. desires that whoever dies first may pray for the
other; and *de Hab. Virg. fin.* makes a similar request: and so
Theodosia in *Euseb. de Mart. Pal*. c. 7.

<span id="xix.viii-p79"></span>In the fourth century, the invocation of
departed saints, or prayer to God for their prayers, becomes common. So
Eusebius, on [Ps. lxxviii.](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#000.md)<span
id="xix.viii-p79.1"></span> (79) takes verse 11, *Preserve Thou the sons
of the slain* (Heb. *of death*), *i.e*., of the martyrs. At the close of
his Com. on Isaiah, he prays just as St. Chrys. in the text. St.
Athanas. *ad Marcellin*. 31, t. i. p. 1001, says we should sing the
Psalms exactly, “that the inspired writers may know their own words, and
pray with us, or rather, that the Holy Spirit who spoke in them, hearing
the words He dictated to them, may take our part” (συναντιλ€βηται, Comp.
[Rom. viii. 26](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#026.md)<span
id="xix.viii-p79.2"></span>). A direct address to the Blessed
Virgin.....“Queen, and Mother of God, intercede for us!” is quoted as
his (*Serm. in Annunt*. t. ii. p. 401), but is spurious, as is there
stated.

<span id="xix.viii-p80"></span>St. James, of Nisibis, Ser. 4, p. 72,
seems to speak of an angel presenting our prayers, which his editor
connects with Tertullian’s *Angelus Orationis, de Or*. xii. and [Tob.
xii. 12](../../../bib/apo/tob012.htm#012.md)<span
id="xix.viii-p80.1"></span>. St. Hilary, on [Ps.
cxxiv.](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#000.md)<span
id="xix.viii-p80.2"></span> (125) 2, takes the *hills* (as others
constantly elsewhere), for the saints and angels. On [Matt.
xxv.](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#000.md)<span id="xix.viii-p80.3"></span>
p. 736, he says, “none shall be helped by another’s works and merits,
because every one must buy oil for his own lamp.” This seems to imply
the existence of the same tendency which St. Chrysostom reproves, as
quoted above on [Gen. xix.](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#000.md)<span
id="xix.viii-p80.4"></span> The Martyr Justina, early in this century,
is said by St. Greg. Naz. *Or*. xviii. p. 279 (Ben. Or. xxiv. 11, p. 443
d.), to have implored the aid of the Virgin Mary.

<span id="xix.viii-p81"></span>In the latter part of the century,
instances are more frequent. St. Cyril of Jerusalem, *Cat. Myst*. v.
(6), says, “Then we commemorate also those who have fallen asleep before
us, first, patriachs, prophets, apostles, martyrs, that at their prayers
and intervention God would receive our petition.” St. Basil, Hom. on the
Forty Martyrs, c. 8, t. 2, p. 155, speaks strongly of the value of their
intercession, and recommends asking it. “Here is found a pious woman
praying for her children, the return of her husband, his recovery when
sick: let your prayers be made with the martyrs!” To Julian the
Apostate, Ep. 360<span id="xix.viii-p81.1"></span>, al. 205, Ben. iii.
462. “I also receive the holy apostles, prophets, and martyrs, and call
on them to supplication unto God, that through them, that is, through
their mediation, the merciful God may become propitious to me, and a
ransom of my sins may be made and granted.” To St. Ambrose, Ep. 197<span
id="xix.viii-p81.2"></span>, al. 55, Ben. iii. 288, he speaks of the
relics of a martyr as protection to those who kept them. St. Ephraim, in
*Martyres*, t. iii. Gr. Lat. p. 251, has, “Victorious Martyrs, willing
sufferers for the love of your God and Saviour, ye that have boldness of
speech toward the Lord Himself; intreat, holy as ye are, for us that are
worthless, and sinners, and full of listlessness, that the grace of
Christ may come upon us.” Some prayers to the Blessed Virgin, calling
her the only hope of sinners, and giving her the titles of our Lord, are
ascribed to him. Such would stand alone in this age, and long after. But
one which has been long known in Latin (ed. Voss, p. 543), has been
generally thought spurious. The last Roman Edition contains more, but
even the <span class="c12"><span id="xix.viii-p81.3"></span>mss</span>.
from which they are taken seem to ascribe them but doubtfully to him
(“Prayers collected from Holy Scripture, but most of them from St.
Ephraim,” &c.), especially as others precede these. He, however, used
invocation freely, though some allowance must be made for his rich
imagination, and his fondness for apostrophe. Thus he apostrophises
Faith, *adv. Scrut. Ser*. vi. Gr. Lat. iii. 160, 161. “O Faith! I pray
Thee adapt Thy vastness to our littleness! for while we may not see and
measure thee, love can neither rest nor be silent!” “Come hither, O
Faith, Gift of God to the Holy Church, and rest in this bosom!” Several
spurious passages, as from the Christus Patiens attributed to St. Greg.
Naz. l. 2582 (but rejected and objected to by the Ben. editor), are
examined by Mr. Palmer, Letter v. to Dr. Wiseman. The real practice of
St. Greg. Naz. appears in his funeral oration on St. Basil, *Or*. xx.
fin. p. 373 (Ben. xliii. 82, p. 831). “But do thou, O divine and sacred
head, look on us from above, and either remove by the intercessions the
thorn in the flesh that chastises us, or persuade us to bear it with
fortitude,” &c. *Or*. vi. *ad Greg. Nyss*. p. 140 (Ben. xi. 5, p. 245),
he says, that martyrs are “Mediators for attaining a divine state”
(θ™ωσις). St. Chrysostom is of the same date. St. Greg. Nyss. on St.
Theodorus, speaks repeatedly of asking his intercession. “To touch his
relics, if any chance give one the opportunity…Then, shedding on them
the tear of piety and affection, as though to the martyr, appearing in
full presence, they present their entreaty for intercession; beseeching
him, as an attendant\* upon God, and invoking him as one who obtains
favors at will,” t. iii. p. 580, and so in other parts of the oration;
and in p. 586, he begs him, if need be, to call his brother-martyrs to
his aid. And in the close of his life of St. Ephraim, he both invokes
him, “Remember us all, asking remission for our sins;” and speaks of a
person having invoked his help, in circumstances of danger, with
success. St. Ambrose, *de Vid*. c. 9, says, “The angels are to be
entreated for us, who are given us for our guard; the martyrs are to be
entreated, whose patronage we may in a manner claim by the pledge of
their bodies. They can pray for our sins, who have washed in their own
blood their own sins, if such they had.” These are most of the authors
alleged down to the end of the fourth century, but in most of the later
of them other passages of the same kind appear. Thus the practice of
direct invocation seems to have come in by degrees, and that chiefly in
the course of this century. Some passages relating merely to the
intercession of the saints have been passed over, as they would rather
confuse the view of the subject of *seeking* it. Bellarmine, *De
Sanctis*, l. i. c. 19, and Coccius, *Thesaur*. l. v., art. 4, give
collections of passages. See on Fleury, Book 19, c. 31, Tr. p. 202, note
k.
