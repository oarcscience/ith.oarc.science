#### <span id="iv.iii.v.xvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVII.

<span id="iv.iii.v.xvii-p1"></span>That the foundation and basis of the
spiritual combat must be laid in the struggle against gluttony.

<span id="iv.iii.v.xvii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.v.xvii-p2.1"></span>Would</span> you like to hear a true
athlete of Christ striving according to the rules and laws of the
conflict? “I,” said he, “so run, not as uncertainly; I so fight, not as
one that beateth the air: but I chastise my body and bring it into
subjection, lest by any means when I have preached to others I myself
should be a castaway.” <span id="fr_843"></span>[844](#fn_843.md) You see
how he made the chief part of the struggle depend upon himself, that is
upon his flesh, as if on a most sure foundation, and placed the result
of the battle simply in the chastisement of the flesh and the subjection
of his body. “I then so run not as uncertainly.” He does not run
uncertainly, because, <span id="fr_844"></span>[845](#fn_844.md) looking to
the heavenly Jerusalem, he has a mark set, towards which his heart is
swiftly directed without swerving. He does not run uncertainly, because,
“forgetting those things which are behind, he reaches forth to those
that are before, pressing towards the mark for the prize of the high
calling of God in Christ Jesus,” <span id="fr_845"></span>[846](#fn_845.md)
whither he ever directs his mental gaze, and hastening towards it with
all speed <span id="fr_846"></span>[847](#fn_846.md) of heart, proclaims
with confidence, “I have fought a good fight, I have finished <span
id="page_240">p. 240</span> <span id="iv.iii.v.xvii-Page_240"></span>my
course, I have kept the faith.” <span id="fr_847"></span>[848](#fn_847.md)
And because he knows he has run unweariedly “after the odour of the
ointment” <span id="fr_848"></span>[849](#fn_848.md) of Christ with ready
devotion of heart, and has won the battle of the spiritual combat by the
chastisement of the flesh, he boldly concludes and says, “Henceforth
there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the
righteous judge, will give to me in that day.” And that he might open up
to us also a like hope of reward, if we desire to imitate him in the
struggle of his course, he added: “But not to me only, but to all also
who love His coming;” <span id="fr_849"></span>[850](#fn_849.md) declaring
that we shall be sharers of his crown in the day of judgment, if we love
the coming of Christ—not that one only which will be manifest to men
even against their will; but also this one which daily comes to pass in
holy souls—and if we gain the victory in the fight by chastising the
body. And of this coming it is that the Lord speaks in the Gospel. “I,”
says He, “and my Father will come to him, and will make our abode with
him.” <span id="fr_850"></span>[851](#fn_850.md) And again: “Behold, I
stand at the door and knock: if any man hear my voice and open the gate,
I will come in to him and will sup with him, and he with me.” <span
id="fr_851"></span>[852](#fn_851.md)
