#### <span id="iv.v.vii.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.

<span id="iv.v.vii.vi-p1"></span>By what means union can be preserved
unbroken.

<span id="iv.v.vii.vi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.vii.vi-p2.1"></span>The</span> first foundation then, of true
friendship consists in contempt for worldly substance and scorn for all
things that we possess. For it is utterly wrong and unjustifiable if,
after the vanity of the world and all that is in it has been renounced,
whatever miserable furniture remains is more regarded than what is most
valuable; viz., the love of a brother. <span id="page_452">p. 452</span>
<span id="iv.v.vii.vi-Page_452"></span>The second is for each man so to
prune his own wishes that he may not imagine himself to be a wise and
experienced person, and so prefer his own opinions to those of his
neighbour. The third is for him to recognize that everything, even what
he deems useful and necessary, must come after the blessing of love and
peace. The fourth for him to realize that he should never be angry for
any reason good or bad. The fifth for him to try to cure any wrath which
a brother may have conceived against him however unreasonably, in the
same way that he would cure his own, knowing that the vexation of
another is equally bad for him, as if he himself were stirred against
another, unless he removes it, to the best of his ability, from his
brother’s mind. The last is what is undoubtedly generally decisive in
regard to all faults; viz., that he should realize daily that he is to
pass away from this world; as the realization of this not only permits
no vexation to linger in the heart, but also represses all the motions
of lusts and sins of all kinds. Whoever then has got hold of this, can
neither suffer nor be the cause of bitter wrath and discord. But when
this fails, as soon as he who is jealous of love has little by little
infused the poison of vexation in the hearts of friends, it is certain
that owing to frequent quarrels love will gradually grow cool, and at
sometime or other he will part the hearts of the lovers, that have been
for a long while exasperated. For if one is walking along the course
previously marked out, how can he ever differ from his friend, for if he
claims nothing for himself, he entirely cuts off the first cause of
quarrel (which generally springs from trivial things and most
unimportant matters), as he observes to the best of his power what we
read in the Acts of the Apostles on the unity of believers: “But the
multitude of believers was of one heart and soul; neither did any of
them say that any of the things which he possessed was his own, but they
had all things common.” <span id="fr_1967"></span>[1968](#fn_1967.md) Then
how can any seeds of discussion arise from him who serves not his own
but his brother’s will, and becomes a follower of his Lord and Master,
who speaking in the character <span id="fr_1968"></span>[1969](#fn_1968.md)
of man which He had taken, said: “I am not come to do Mine own will, but
the will of Him that sent Me?” <span
id="fr_1969"></span>[1970](#fn_1969.md) But how can he arouse any
incitement to contention, who has determined to trust not so much to his
own judgment as to his brother’s decision, on his own intelligence and
meaning, in accordance with his will either approving or disapproving
his discoveries, and fulfilling in the humility of a pious heart these
words from the Gospel: “Nevertheless, not as I will, but as Thou
wilt.” <span id="fr_1970"></span>[1971](#fn_1970.md) Or in what way will he
admit anything which grieves the brother, who thinks that nothing is
more precious than the blessing of peace, and never forgets these words
of the Lord: “By this shall all men know that ye are My disciples, that
ye love one another;” <span id="fr_1971"></span>[1972](#fn_1971.md) for by
this, as by a special mark, Christ willed that the flock of His sheep
should be known in this world, and be separated from all others by this
stamp, so to speak? But on what grounds will he endure either to admit
the rancour of vexation in himself or for it to remain in another, if
his firm decision is that there cannot be any good ground for anger, as
it is dangerous and wrong, and that when his broker is angry with him he
cannot pray, in just the same way as when he himself is angry with his
brother, as he ever keeps in an humble heart these words of our Lord and
Saviour: “If thou bring thy gift to the altar and there remember that
thy brother hath aught against thee, leave there thy gift at the altar,
and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and
offer thy gift.” <span id="fr_1972"></span>[1973](#fn_1972.md) For it will
be of no use for you to declare that you are not angry, and to believe
that you are fulfilling the command which says: “Let not the sun go down
upon thy wrath;” and: “Whosoever is angry with his brother, shall be in
danger of the judgment,” <span id="fr_1973"></span>[1974](#fn_1973.md) if
you are with obstinate heart disregarding the vexation of another which
you could smooth down by kindness on your part. For in the same way you
will be punished for violating the Lord’s command. For He who said that
you should not be angry with another, said also that you should not
disregard the vexations of another, for it makes no difference in the
sight of God, “Who willeth all men to be saved,” <span
id="fr_1974"></span>[1975](#fn_1974.md) whether you destroy yourself or
someone else. Since the death of any one is equally a loss to God, and
at the same time it is equally a gain to him to whom all destruction is
delightful, whether it is acquired by your death or by the death of your
brother. Lastly, how can he retain even the least vexation with his
brother, who realizes daily that he is presently to depart from this
world?
