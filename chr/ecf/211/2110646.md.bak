#### <span id="iv.iv.v.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.

<span id="iv.iv.v.v-p1"></span>How our efforts and exertions are of no
use without God’s help.

<span id="iv.iv.v.v-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.v.v-p2.1"></span>And</span> by this it is clearly shown that
God’s grace and mercy always work in us what is good, and that when it
forsakes us, the efforts of the worker are useless, and that however
earnestly a man may strive, he cannot regain his former condition
without His help, and that this saying is constantly fulfilled in our
case: that it is “not of him that willeth or runneth but of God which
hath mercy.” <span id="fr_1286"></span>[1287](#fn_1286.md) And this grace
on the other hand sometimes does not refuse to visit with that holy
inspiration of which you spoke, and with an abundance of spiritual
thoughts, even the careless and indifferent; but inspires the unworthy,
arouses the slumberers, and enlightens those who are blinded by
ignorance, and mercifully reproves us and chastens us, shedding itself
abroad in our hearts, that thus we may be stirred by the compunction
which He excites, and impelled <span id="page_332">p. 332</span> <span
id="iv.iv.v.v-Page_332"></span>to rise from the sleep of sloth. Lastly
we are often filled by His sudden visitation with sweet odours, beyond
the power of human composition—so that the soul is ravished with these
delights, and caught up, as it were, into an ecstasy of spirit, and
becomes oblivious of the fact that it is still in the flesh.
