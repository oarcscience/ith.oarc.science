#### <span id="iv.vi.v.ii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.

<span id="iv.vi.v.ii-p1"></span>The exhortation of Abbot John to Theonas
and the others who had come together with him.

<span id="iv.vi.v.ii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.v.ii-p2.1"></span>I am</span> indeed delighted, my children,
with the duteous liberality of your gifts; and your devout offering, the
disposal of which is entrusted to me, I gratefully accept, because you
are offering your firstfruits and tithes for the good and use of the
needy, as a sacrifice to the Lord, of a sweet smelling savour, in the
belief that by the offering of them, the abundance of your fruits and
all your substance, from which you have taken away these for the Lord,
will be richly blessed, and that you yourselves will according to the
faith of His command be endowed even in this world with manifold
richness in all good things: “Honour the Lord from thy righteous
labours, and offer to Him of the fruits of thy righteousness; that thy
garners may be full of abundance of wheat, and thy vats may overflow
with wine.” <span id="fr_2161"></span>[2162](#fn_2161) And as you are
faithfully carrying out this service, you may know that you have
fulfilled the righteousness of the old law, under which those who then
lived if they transgressed it inevitably incurred guilt, while if they
fulfilled it they could not attain to a pitch of perfection.
