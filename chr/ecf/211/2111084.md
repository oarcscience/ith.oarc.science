#### <span id="iv.vi.viii.xxiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXIV.

<span id="iv.vi.viii.xxiv-p1"></span>Why the Lord’s yoke is felt
grievous and His burden heavy.

<span id="iv.vi.viii.xxiv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.viii.xxiv-p2.1"></span>But</span> the fact that to us on the
contrary the yoke of Christ seems neither light nor easy, must be
rightly ascribed to our perverseness, as we are cast down by unbelief
and want of faith, and fight with foolish obstinacy against His command,
or rather advice, who says: “If thou wilt be perfect, go sell (or get
rid of) all that thou hast, and come follow Me,” <span
id="fr_2332"></span>[2333](#fn_2332.md) for we keep the substance of our
worldly goods. And as the devil holds our soul fast in the toils of
these, what remains but that, when he wants to sever us from spiritual
delights, he should vex us by diminishing these and depriving us of
them, contriving by his crafty wiles that when the sweetness of His yoke
and lightness of His burden have become grievous to us through the evil
of a corrupt desire, and when we are caught in the chains of that very
property and substance, which we kept for our comfort and solace, he may
<span id="page_542">p. 542</span> <span
id="iv.vi.viii.xxiv-Page_542"></span>always torment us with the scourges
of worldly cares, extorting from us ourselves that wherewith we are
tortured? For “Each one is bound by the cords of his own sins,” and
hears from the prophet: “Behold all you that kindle a fire, encompassed
with flames, walk in the light of your fire, and in the flames which you
have kindled.” Since, as Solomon is witness, “Each man shall thereby be
punished, whereby he has sinned.” <span
id="fr_2333"></span>[2334](#fn_2333.md) For the very pleasures which we
enjoy become a torment to us, and the delights and enjoyments of this
flesh, turn like executioners upon their originator, because one who is
supported by his former wealth and property is sure not to admit perfect
humility of heart, not entire mortification of dangerous pleasures. But
where all these implements of goodness give their aid, there all the
trials of this present life, and whatever losses the enemy can contrive,
are endured not only with the utmost patience, but with real pleasure,
and again when they are wanting so dangerous a pride springs up that we
are actually wounded by the deadly strokes of impatience at the
slightest reproach, and it may be said to us by the prophet Jeremiah:
“And now what hast thou to do in the way of Egypt, to drink the troubled
water? And what hast thou to do with the way of the Assyrians, to drink
the water of the river? Thy own wickedness shall reprove thee, and thy
apostasy shall rebuke thee. Know thou and see that it is an evil and a
bitter thing for thee to have left the Lord thy God, and that My fear is
not with thee, saith the Lord.” <span
id="fr_2334"></span>[2335](#fn_2334.md) How then is it that the wondrous
sweetness of the Lord’s yoke is felt to be bitter, but because the
bitterness of our dislike injures it? How is it that the exceeding
lightness of the Divine burden becomes heavy, but because in our
obstinate presumption we despise Him by whom it was borne, especially as
Scripture itself plainly testifies to this very thing saying: “For if
they would walk in right paths, they would certainly have found the
paths of righteousness smooth”? <span
id="fr_2335"></span>[2336](#fn_2335.md) It is plain, I say, that it is we,
who make rough with the nasty and hard stones of our desires the right
and smooth paths of the Lord; who most foolishly forsake the royal road
made stony with the flints of apostles and prophets, and trodden down by
the footsteps of all the saints and of the Lord Himself, and seek
trackless and thorny places, and, blinded by the allurements of present
delights, tear our way with torn legs and our wedding garment rent,
through dark paths, overrun with the briars of sins, so as not only to
be pierced by the sharp thorns of the brambles but actually laid low by
the bites of deadly serpents and scorpions lurking there. For “there are
thorns and thistles in wrong ways, but he that feareth the Lord shall
keep himself from them.” <span id="fr_2336"></span>[2337](#fn_2336.md) Of
such also the Lord says elsewhere by the prophet: “My people have
forgotten, sacrificing in vain, and stumbling in their ways, in ancient
paths, to walk in them in a way not trodden.” <span
id="fr_2337"></span>[2338](#fn_2337.md) For according to Solomon’s saying:
“The ways of those who do not work are strewn with thorns, but the ways
of the lusty are trodden down.” <span
id="fr_2338"></span>[2339](#fn_2338.md) And thus wandering from the king’s
highway, they can never arrive at that metropolis, whither our course
should ever be directed without swerving. And this also Ecclesiastes has
pretty significantly expressed saying: “The labour of fools wearies
those who know not how to go to the city;” viz., that “heavenly
Jerusalem, which is the mother of us all.” <span
id="fr_2339"></span>[2340](#fn_2339.md) But whoever truly gives up this
world and takes upon him Christ’s yoke and learns of Him, and is trained
in the daily practice of suffering wrong, for He is “meek and lowly of
heart,” <span id="fr_2340"></span>[2341](#fn_2340.md) will ever remain
undisturbed by all temptations, and “all things will work together for
good to him.” <span id="fr_2341"></span>[2342](#fn_2341.md) For as the
prophet Obadiah says the words of God are “good to him that walketh
uprightly;” and again: “For the ways of the Lord are right, and the just
shall walk in them; but the transgressors shall fall in them.” <span
id="fr_2342"></span>[2343](#fn_2342.md)
