<span id="ii.v.ii.x"></span>

#### <span id="ii.v.ii.x-p0.1"></span>Chapter X.

<span id="ii.v.ii.x-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.ii.x-p1.1"></span>Wherefore</span>, I beseech you, O virgin, do
not flatter yourself on the ground of your purity alone, and do not
trust in the perfection of one member; but according to the Apostle,
maintain the sanctity of your body throughout. Cleanse thy head from all
defilement, because it is a disgrace that it, after the sanctifying oil
has been applied to it, should be polluted with the juice or powder of
either crocus, or any other pigment, or should be adorned with gold or
gems or any other earthly ornament, because it already shines with the
radiance of heavenly adornment. It is undoubtedly a grave insult to
Divine grace to prefer to it any mundane and worldly ornament. And next,
cleanse thy forehead, that it may blush at human, and not at Divine
works, and may display that shame which gives rise not to sin, but to
the favor of God, as the sacred Scripture declares, “There is a shame
that causes sin, and there is a shame that brings with it the
favor <span id="fr_186"></span>[187](#fn_186.md) of God.” Cleanse, too, thy
neck, that it may not carry thy <span id="fr_187"></span>[188](#fn_187.md)
locks in a golden net and necklaces hung round it, <span id="page_63">p.
63</span> <span id="ii.v.ii.x-Page_63"></span>but may rather bear about
it those ornaments of which the Scripture says, “Let not <span
id="fr_188"></span>[189](#fn_188.md) mercy and faith depart from thee,” and
hang them upon thy heart as upon thy neck. Cleanse thine eyes, whilst
thou dost withdraw them from all concupiscence, and dost never turn them
away from the sight of the poor, and dost keep them from all dyes, in
that purity in which they were made by God. Cleanse thy tongue from
falsehood, because “a mouth <span id="fr_189"></span>[190](#fn_189.md)
which tells lies destroys the soul”: cleanse it from detraction, from
swearing, and from perjury. I beg you not to think it is an inverted
order that I have said the tongue should be cleansed from swearing
before perjury, for one will then the more easily escape perjury, if he
swears not at all, so that there may be fulfilled in him that statement,
“Keep <span id="fr_190"></span>[191](#fn_190.md) thy tongue from evil, and
thy lips from speaking guile.” And be mindful of the Apostle who says,
“Bless, and <span id="fr_191"></span>[192](#fn_191.md) curse not.” But
often call to mind the following words, “See that no one render evil for
evil to any man, or cursing for cursing, but on the contrary, do ye
bless them, because to this ye have been called, that ye should possess
a blessing <span id="fr_192"></span>[193](#fn_192.md) by inheritance”; and
this other passage, “If any <span id="fr_193"></span>[194](#fn_193.md) one
offend not in tongue, he is a perfect man.” For it is shameful that
those lips, by which you confess God, pray to him, bless him, and praise
him, should be defiled by the pollution of any sin. I know not with what
conscience any one can pray to <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.ii.x-p9.2"></span>God</span> with that tongue with which he
either speaks falsehood, or calumniates, or detracts. God listens to
holy lips, and speedily answers those prayers which an unpolluted tongue
pours forth. Cleanse also thine ears, so that they may not listen except
to holy and true discourse, that they never admit into them obscene, or
infamous, or worldly words, or tolerate any one detracting from another,
on account of that which is written, “Hedge up <span
id="fr_194"></span>[195](#fn_194.md) thine ears with thorns, and do not
listen to a wicked tongue, that you may have your part with him, of whom
it is said, that he was <span id="fr_195"></span>[196](#fn_195.md)
righteous in hearing and seeing; i.e. he sinned neither with his eyes
nor his ears. Cleanse, too, thy hands, “that they be not stretched out
to receive, but shut against giving,” and that they <span
id="fr_196"></span>[197](#fn_196.md) be not prompt to strike, but ever
ready for all the works of mercy and piety. In fine, cleanse thy feet,
that they follow not the broad and ample way which leads to grand and
costly worldly banquets, but that they tread rather the difficult and
narrow path, which guides to heaven, for it is written, “Make a <span
id="fr_197"></span>[198](#fn_197.md) straight path for your feet.”
Acknowledge that your members were formed for you by God the Maker, not
for vices, but for virtues; and, when you have cleansed the whole of
your limbs from every stain of sin, and they have become sanctified
throughout your whole body, then understand that this purity will profit
you, and look forward with all confidence to the prize of virginity.
