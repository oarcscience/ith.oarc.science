#### <span id="iv.iii.iii.xi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XI.

<span id="iv.iii.iii.xi-p1"></span>Of the points in which the service
held on Sunday differs from what is customary on other days.

<span id="iv.iii.iii.xi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.iii.xi-p2.1"></span>But</span> we ought to know this, too,
that on Sunday only one office <span id="fr_753"></span>[754](#fn_753)
is celebrated before dinner, at which, out of regard for the actual
service <span id="fr_754"></span>[755](#fn_754) and the Lord’s
communion, they use a more solemn and a longer service of Psalms and
prayers and lessons, and so consider that Tierce and Sext are included
in it. And hence it results that, owing to the addition of the lessons,
there is no diminution of the amount of their devotions, and yet some
difference is made, and an indulgence over other times seems to be
granted to the brethren out of reverence for the Lord’s resurrection;
and this seems to lighten the observance all through the week, and, by
reason of the difference which is interposed, it makes the day to be
looked forward to more solemnly as a festival, and owing to the
anticipation of it the fasts of the coming week are less felt. For any
weariness is always borne with greater equanimity, and labour undertaken
without aversion, if some variety is interposed or change of work
succeeds.

<span id="iv.iii.iii.xi-p4"></span> *Collecta*. This word, from which
our word “Collect” is possibly derived, is used for an assembly for
worship in the Vulgate in [Lev. 23:36](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#036),
[Deut. 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#008), [2 Chr.
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#009), [Neh.
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#018)<span

in the Sacramentary of Gregory for the Feast of the Purification.
