<span id="ii.vi.ii.xviii-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.vi.ii.xviii-p1.1"></span>For</span>, first of all, under king
Seleucus, the son of Antiochus the great, a certain man called Simon
accused to the king on false charges Onias the priest, a holy and
uncorrupted man, and thus tried, but in vain, to overthrow him. Then,
after an interval of time, Jason, the brother of Onias, went to
Antiochus the king, who had succeeded his brother Seleucus, and promised
him an increase of tribute, if the high-priesthood were transferred to
him. And although it was an unusual, and indeed, until now, an
unpermitted thing for a man to enjoy the high-priesthood year after
year, still the eager mind of the king, diseased with avarice, was
easily persuaded. Accordingly, Onias was driven from office, and the
priesthood bestowed on Jason. He harassed his countrymen and his country
in the most shameful manner. Then, as he had sent through a certain
Menelaus (the brother of that Simon who has been mentioned) the money he
had promised to the king, a way being once laid open to his ambition,
Menelaus obtained the priesthood by the same arts which Jason had
employed before. But not long after, as he had not furnished the
promised amount of money, he was driven from his position, and
Lysimachus substituted in his stead. Then there arose disgraceful
conflicts between Jason and Menelaus, until Jason, as an exile, left the
country. By examples like these, the morals of the people became
corrupted to such an extent, that numbers of the natives begged
permission from Antiochus to live after the fashion of the Gentiles. And
when the king granted their request, all the most worthless vied with
each other in their endeavors to construct temples, to sacrifice to
idols, and to profane the law. In the meantime, Antiochus returned from
Alexandria (for he had then made war upon the king of Egypt, which,
however, he gave up by the orders of the senate and Roman people, when
Paulus and Crassus were consuls), and went to Jerusalem. Finding the
people at variance from the diverse superstitions they had adopted, he
destroyed the law of God, and showed favor to those who followed impious
courses, while he carried off all the ornaments of the temple, and
wasted it with much destruction. That came to pass in the hundred and
fiftieth year after the death of Alexander, Paulus and Crassus being, as
we have said, consuls, about five years after Antiochus began to reign.
