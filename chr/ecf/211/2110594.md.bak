#### <span id="iv.iv.iii.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.iii-p1"></span>Of the error of Saul and of Ahab, by
which they were deceived through lack of discretion.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.iii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.iii.iii-p2.1"></span>Lastly</span>, the man who in the
judgment of God was the first to be worthy of the kingdom of His people
Israel, because he was lacking in this “eye” of discretion, was, as if
his whole body were full of darkness, actually cast down from the
kingdom while, being deceived by the darkness of this “light,” and in
error, he imagined that his own offerings were more acceptable to God
than obedience to the command of Samuel, and met with an occasion of
falling in that very matter in which he had hoped to propitiate the
Divine Majesty. <span id="fr_1165"></span>[1166](#fn_1165.md) And
ignorance, I say, of this discretion led Ahab the king of Israel after a
triumph and splendid victory which had been granted to him by the favour
of God to fancy that mercy on his part was better than the stern
execution of the divine command, and, as it seemed to him, a cruel rule:
and moved by this consideration, while he desired to temper a bloody
victory with mercy, he was on account of his indiscriminating clemency
rendered full of darkness in his whole body, and condemned irreversibly
to death. <span id="fr_1166"></span>[1167](#fn_1166.md)
