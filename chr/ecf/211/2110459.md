#### <span id="iv.iii.viii.xi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XI.

<span id="iv.iii.viii.xi-p1"></span>Of those to whose wrath even the
going down of the sun sets no limit.

<span id="iv.iii.viii.xi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.viii.xi-p2.1"></span>But</span> what am I to say of those
(and I cannot say it without shame on my own part) to whose
implacability even the going down of the sun sets no bound: but
prolonging it for several days, and nourishing rancorous feelings
against those against whom they have been excited, they say in words
that they are not angry, but in fact and deed they show that <span
id="page_261">p. 261</span> <span
id="iv.iii.viii.xi-Page_261"></span>they are extremely disturbed? For
they do not speak to them pleasantly, nor address them with ordinary
civility, and they think that they are not doing wrong in this, because
they do not seek to avenge themselves for their upset. But since they
either do not dare, or at any rate are not able to show their anger
openly, and give place to it, they drive in, to their own detriment, the
poison of anger, and secretly cherish it in their hearts, and silently
feed on it in themselves; without shaking off by an effort of mind their
sulky disposition, but digesting it as the days go by, and somewhat
mitigating it after a while.
