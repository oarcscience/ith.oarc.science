#### <span id="iv.iv.vii.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VIII.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.viii-p1"></span>The answer to the foregoing
question.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.viii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.vii.viii-p2.1"></span>Theodore</span>: We are talking about
the actual qualities of things good and bad, and what we call
indifferent; and not about the characters of the men who do these
things. Nor ought any bad or wicked man to go unpunished because his
evil deed was not able to do harm to a good man. For the endurance and
goodness of a righteous man are of no profit to the man who is the cause
of his death or suffering, but only to him who patiently endures what is
inflicted on him. And so the one is justly punished for savage cruelty,
because he meant to injure him, while the other nevertheless suffers no
evil, because in the goodness of his heart he patiently endures his
temptation and sufferings, and so causes all those things, which were
inflicted upon him with evil intent, to turn out to his advantage, and
to conduce to the bliss of eternal life.

adversity is advantageous to a good man.](2110700)
