<span id="iv.iii.iv.xli"></span>

#### <span id="iv.iii.iv.xli-p0.1"></span>Chapter XLI.

<span id="iv.iii.iv.xli-p1"></span>The appearance of what infirmities
one who lives in a Cœnobium ought to exhibit. <span
id="fr_812"></span>[813](#fn_812)

<span id="iv.iii.iv.xli-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.iv.xli-p3.1"></span>And</span> that you may be able to attain
all this, and continually remain subject to this spiritual rule, you
must observe these three things in the congregation: viz.: that as the
Psalmist says: “I was like a deaf man and heard not and as one that is
dumb who doth not open his mouth; and I became as a man that heareth
not, and in whose mouth there are no reproofs,” <span
id="fr_813"></span>[814](#fn_813) so you also should walk as one that is
deaf and dumb and blind, so that—putting aside the contemplation of him
who has been rightly chosen by you as your model of perfection—you
should be like a blind man and not see any of those things which you
find to be unedifying, nor <span id="fr_814"></span>[815](#fn_814) be
influenced by the authority or fashion of those who do these things, and
give yourself up to what is worse and what you formerly condemned. If
you hear any one disobedient or insubordinate or disparaging another or
doing anything different from what was taught to you, you should not go
wrong and be led astray by such an <span id="page_233">p. 233</span>
<span id="iv.iii.iv.xli-Page_233"></span>example to imitate him; but,
“like a deaf man,” as if you had never heard it, you should pass it all
by. If insults are offered to you or to any one else, or wrongs done, be
immovable, and as far as an answer in retaliation is concerned be silent
“as one that is dumb,” always singing in your heart this verse of the
Psalmist: “I said I will take heed to my ways that I offend not with my
tongue. I set a guard to my mouth when the sinner stood before me. I was
dumb and was humbled and kept silence from good things.” <span
id="fr_815"></span>[816](#fn_815) But cultivate above everything this
fourth thing which adorns and graces those three of which we have spoken
above; viz.: make yourself, as the Apostle directs, <span
id="fr_816"></span>[817](#fn_816) a fool in this world that you may
become wise, exercising no discrimination and judgment of your own on
any of those matters which are commanded to you, but always showing
obedience with all simplicity and faith, judging that alone to be holy,
useful, and wise which God’s law or the decision of your superior
declares to you to be such. For built up on such a system of instruction
you may continue forever under this discipline, and not fall away from
the monastery in consequence of any temptations or devices of the enemy.
