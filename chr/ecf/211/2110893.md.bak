<span id="iv.v.vii.ii-p1"></span>Discourse of the same elder on the
untrustworthy sort of friendship.

<span id="iv.v.vii.ii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.vii.ii-p2.1"></span>There</span> are many kinds of friendship
and companionship which unite men in very different ways in the bonds of
love. For some a previous recommendation makes to enter upon an
intercourse first of acquaintance and afterwards even of friendship. In
the case of others some bargain or an agreement to give and take
something has joined them in the bonds of love. Others a similarity and
union of business or science or art or study has united in the chain of
friendship, by which even fierce souls become kindly disposed to each
other, so that those, who in forests and mountains delight in robbery
and revel in human bloodshed, embrace and cherish the partners of their
crimes. But there is another kind of love, where the union is from the
instincts of nature and the laws of consanguinity, whereby those of the
same tribe, wives and parents, and brothers and children are naturally
preferred to others, a thing which we find is the case not only with
mankind but with all birds and beasts. For at the prompting of a natural
instinct they protect and defend their offspring and their young ones so
that often they are not afraid to expose themselves to danger and death
for their sakes. Indeed those kinds of beasts and serpents and birds,
which are cut off and separated from all others by their intolerable
ferocity or deadly poison, as basilisks, unicorns and vultures, though
by their very look they are said to be dangerous to every one, yet among
themselves they remain peaceful and harmless owing to community of
origin and fellow-feeling. But we see that all these kinds of love of
which we have spoken, as they are common both to the good and bad, and
to beasts and serpents, certainly cannot last for ever. For often
separation of place interrupts and breaks them off, as well as
forgetfulness from lapse of time, and the transaction of affairs and
business and words. For as they are generally due to different kinds of
connexions either of gain, or desires, or kinship, or business, so when
any occasion for separation intervenes they are broken off.
