#### <span id="iv.v.viii.xxi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXI.

<span id="iv.v.viii.xxi-p1"></span>Whether secret abstinence ought to be
made known, without telling a lie about it, to those who ask, and
whether what has once been declined may be taken in hand.

<span id="iv.v.viii.xxi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.viii.xxi-p2.1"></span>And</span> to bring forward some
instances from our unavoidable and almost daily wants which with all our
care we can never so guard against as not to be driven to incur them
whether with or against our will: what, I ask you, is to be done when,
while we are proposing to put off our supper, a brother comes and asks
us if we have had it: is our fast to <span id="page_469">p. 469</span>
<span id="iv.v.viii.xxi-Page_469"></span>be concealed, and the good act
of abstinence hidden, or is it to be proclaimed by telling the truth? If
we conceal it, to satisfy the Lord’s command which says: “Thou shalt not
appear unto men to fast but unto thy Father Who is in secret;” and
again: “Let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth,” <span
id="fr_2044"></span>[2045](#fn_2044.md) we must at once tell a lie. If we
make manifest the good act of abstinence, the word of the gospel rightly
discourages us: “Verily I say unto you, they have their reward.” <span
id="fr_2045"></span>[2046](#fn_2045.md) But what if any one has refused
with determination a cup offered to him by some brother, denying
altogether that he will take what the other, rejoicing at his arrival,
begs and intreats him to receive? Is it right that he should force
himself to yield to his brother who goes on his knees and bows himself
to the ground, and who thinks that he can only show his loving heart by
this service, or should he obstinately cling to his own word and
intention?
