#### <span id="iv.iii.vii.xxvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXVI.

<span id="iv.iii.vii.xxvi-p1"></span>That covetousness brings upon the
soul a spiritual leprosy.

<span id="iv.iii.vii.xxvi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.vii.xxvi-p2.1"></span>And</span> such are seen to be lepers
in spirit and heart, after the likeness of Gehazi, who, desiring the
uncertain riches of this world, was covered with the taint of foul
leprosy, through which he left us a clear example that every soul which
is defiled with the stain of cupidity is covered with the spiritual
leprosy of sin, and is counted as unclean before God with a perpetual
curse.
