#### <span id="iv.vii.vi.xv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XV.

<span id="iv.vii.vi.xv-p1"></span>What the prayers of the saints for the
coming of Messiah contained; and what was the nature of that longing of
theirs.

<span id="iv.vii.vi.xv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.vi.xv-p2.1"></span>This</span> then all the saints wished
for: for this they prayed. This they longed to see with their eyes in
proportion as they were wise in heart and mind. And so the prophet
Isaiah says: “O that Thou wouldst rend the heavens and come down.” <span
id="fr_2541"></span>[2542](#fn_2541.md) But Habakkuk too declaring the same
thing which the other was wishing for, says: “When the years draw nigh,
Thou wilt show Thyself: at the coming of the times Thou wilt be
manifested: God will come from Teman,” or “God will come from the
south.” <span id="fr_2542"></span>[2543](#fn_2542.md) David also: “God will
clearly come:” and again: “Thou that sittest above the Cherubim, show
Thyself.” <span id="fr_2543"></span>[2544](#fn_2543.md) Some declared His
advent which He presented to the world: others prayed for it. Some in
different forms but all with equal longing: understanding up to a
certain point how great a thing they were praying for, that God dwelling
in God, and continuing in the form and bosom of God, might “empty
Himself,” <span id="fr_2544"></span>[2545](#fn_2544.md) and take the form
of a servant and submit Himself to endure all the bitterness and insults
of the passion, and undergo punishment for His goodness, and what is
hardest, and the most disgraceful thing of all, meet with death at the
hands of those very persons for whom He would die. All the saints then
understanding this up to a certain point—up to a certain point, I say,
for how vast it is none can understand—with concordant voice and (so to
speak) by mutual consent all prayed for the advent of God: for indeed
they knew that the hope of all men lay therein, and that the salvation
of all was bound up in this, because no one could loose the prisoners
except one who was Himself free from chains: no one could release
sinners, save one Himself without sin: for no one can in any case set
free anyone, unless he is himself free in that particular, in which
another is freed by him. And so when death had passed on all, all were
wanting in life, that, dying in Adam, they might live in Christ. For
though there were many saints, many elect and even friends of God, yet
none could ever of themselves be saved, had they not been saved by the
advent of the Lord and His redemption.
