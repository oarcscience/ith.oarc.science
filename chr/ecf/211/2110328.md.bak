<span id="iv.iii.iii.xii-p1"></span>Of the days on which, when supper is
provided for the brethren, a Psalm is not said as they assemble for the
meals as is usual at dinner.

<span id="iv.iii.iii.xii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.iii.xii-p2.1"></span>Lastly</span>, also, on those
days,—i.e., on Saturday and Sunday,—and on holy days, on which it is
usual for both dinner and supper to be provided for the brethren, a
Psalm is not said in the evening, either when they come to supper or
when they rise from it, as is usual at their ordinary dinner <span
id="fr_755"></span>[756](#fn_755.md) and the canonical refreshment on fast
days, which the customary Psalms usually precede and follow. But they
simply make a plain prayer and come to supper, and again, when they rise
from it, conclude with prayer alone; because this repast is something
special among the monks: nor are they all obliged to come to it, but it
is only for strangers who have come to see the brethren, and those whom
bodily weakness or their own inclination invites to it.

<span id="iv.iii.iii.xii-p3"></span> *In sollemnibus prandiis*. The
phrase must here refer to their dinner on ordinary days (cf.
solemnitatem ciborum, “their usual food,” Book IV. c. xxi.). Among the
early monks it was the custom ordinarily to have but one meal a day on
the fast days (viz., Wednesday and Friday); this was at the ninth hour;
on other days, at the sixth (i.e., midday). Cf. the Conferences XXI. c.
xxiii. On festivals (viz., Saturday, Sunday, and holy days), beside the
midday meal a supper was allowed as well. And on these days, as we learn
from the passage before us, the ordinary grace before and after meat was
shortened by the omission of the customary Psalms at other times
included in it. On the meals of the monks, cf. S. Jerome’s Preface to
the Rule of Pachomius and the Rule of S. Benedict, cc. xxxix.–xli., the
former of which tells us that, except on Wednesday and Friday, dinner
was at midday, and a table was also set for labourers, old men, and
children, and (apparently) for all, in the height of summer. For the use
of Psalms at grace, see Clement of Alexandria, *Pœdag*. II. iv. 44;
*Stromateis* VII. vii. 49.
