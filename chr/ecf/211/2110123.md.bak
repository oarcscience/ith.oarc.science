#### <span id="ii.v.ii.xv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XV.

<span id="ii.v.ii.xv-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.ii.xv-p1.1"></span>If</span> you wish, then, to be with Christ,
you must live according to the example of Christ, who was so far removed
from all evil and wickedness, that he did not render a recompense even
to his enemies, but rather even prayed for them. For I do not wish you
to reckon those souls Christian, who (I do not say) hate either their
brothers or sisters, but who do not, before God as a witness, love their
neighbors with their whole heart and conscience, since it is a bounden
duty for Christians, after the example of Christ himself, even to love
their enemies. If you desire to possess fellowship with the saints,
cleanse your heart from the thought of malice and sin. Let no one
circumvent you; let no one delude you by beguiling speech. The court of
heaven will admit none except the holy, and righteous, and simple, and
innocent, and pure. Evil has no place in the presence of God. It is
necessary that he who desires to reign with Christ should be free from
all wickedness and guile. Nothing is so offensive, and nothing so
detestable to God, as to hate any one, to wish to harm any one; while
nothing is so acceptable to him as to love all men. The prophet knowing
this bears witness to it when he teaches, “Ye who <span
id="fr_216"></span>[217](#fn_216.md) love the Lord, hate evil.”
