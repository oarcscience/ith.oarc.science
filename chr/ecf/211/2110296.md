#### <span id="iv.iii.i.xi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XI.

<span id="iv.iii.i.xi-p1"></span>Of the Spiritual Girdle and its
Mystical Meaning. <span id="fr_666"></span>[667](#fn_666)

<span id="iv.iii.i.xi-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.i.xi-p3.1"></span>Clad</span>, therefore, in these vestments,
the soldier of Christ should know first of all that he is protected by
the girdle tied round him, not only that he may be ready in mind for all
the work and business of the monastery, but also that he may always go
without being hindered by his dress. For he will be proved to be the
more ardent in purity of heart for spiritual progress and the knowledge
of Divine things in proportion as he is the more earnest in his zeal for
obedience and work. Secondly, he should realize that in the actual
wearing of the girdle there is no small mystery declaring what is
demanded of him. For the girding of the loins and binding them round
with a dead skin signifies that he bears about the mortification of
those members in which are contained the seeds of lust and
lasciviousness, always knowing that the command of the gospel, which
says, “Let your loins be girt about,” <span
id="fr_667"></span>[668](#fn_667) is applied to him by the Apostle’s
interpretation; to wit, “Mortify your members which are upon the earth;
fornication, uncleanness, lust, evil concupiscence.” <span
id="fr_668"></span>[669](#fn_668) And so we find in Holy Scripture that
only those were girt with the girdle in whom the seeds of carnal lust
are found to <span id="page_205">p. 205</span> <span
id="iv.iii.i.xi-Page_205"></span>be destroyed, and who sing with might
and main this utterance of the blessed David: “For I am become like a
bottle in the frost,” <span id="fr_669"></span>[670](#fn_669) because
when the sinful flesh is destroyed in the inmost parts they can distend
by the power of the spirit the dead skin of the outward man. And
therefore he significantly adds “in the frost,” because they are never
satisfied merely with the mortification of the heart, but also have the
motions of the outward man and the incentives of nature itself frozen by
the approach of the frost of continence from without, if only, as the
Apostle says, they no longer allow any reign of sin in their mortal
body, nor wear a flesh that resists the spirit. <span

monks is as follows: “Let the dress of the brethren be adapted to the
character of the place or climate in which they live, as more clothing
is required in cold than in hot countries. Hence we leave this to the
abbot to determine. However, in temperate climates we are of the opinion
that it will be enough for each monk to have a hood and a frock, a rough
one for the winter, and in the summer a simple or old one; a scapular
also for work; and the cover of the feet, shoes and socks. And the monks
are not to complain of the colour or size of these articles, but to be
satisfied with whatever can be found or got cheapest in the country
where they live.” Regula S. Bened. c. lv.
