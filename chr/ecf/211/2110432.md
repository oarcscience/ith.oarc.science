#### <span id="iv.iii.vii.xvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVI.

<span id="iv.iii.vii.xvi-p1"></span>Of the authority under which those
shelter themselves who object to stripping themselves of their goods.

<span id="iv.iii.vii.xvi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.vii.xvi-p2.1"></span>These</span> then try to make out a case
for their original avarice, by some authority from Holy Scripture, which
they interpret with base ingenuity, in their desire to wrest and pervert
to their own purposes a saying of the Apostle or rather of the Lord
Himself: and, not adapting their own life or understanding to the
meaning of the Scripture, but making the meaning of Scripture bend to
the desires of their own lust, they try to make it to correspond to
their own views, and say that it is written, “It is more blessed to give
than to receive.” <span id="fr_890"></span>[891](#fn_890.md) And by an
entirely wrong interpretation of this they think that they can weaken
the force of that saying of the Lord in which he says: “If thou wilt be
perfect, go sell all that thou hast and give to the poor, and thou shalt
have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.” <span
id="fr_891"></span>[892](#fn_891.md) And they think that under colour of
this they need not deprive themselves of their riches: declaring indeed
that they are more blessed if, supported by that which originally
belonged to them, they give to others also out of their superabundance.
And while they are shy of embracing with the Apostle that glorious state
of abnegation for Christ’s sake, they will not be content either with
manual labour or the sparing diet of the monastery. And the only thing
is that these must either know that they are deceiving themselves, and
have not really renounced the world while they are clinging to their
former riches; or, if they really and truly want to make trial of the
monastic life, they must give up and forsake all these things and keep
back nothing of that which they have renounced, and, with the Apostle,
glory “in hunger and thirst, in cold and nakedness.” <span
