#### <span id="iv.iii.iv.xii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XII.

<span id="iv.iii.iv.xii-p1"></span>How they leave off every kind of work
at the sound of some one knocking at the door, in their eagerness to
answer at once.

<span id="iv.iii.iv.xii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.iv.xii-p2.1"></span>And</span> so, sitting in their cells and
devoting their energies equally to work and to meditation, when they
hear the sound of some one knocking at the door and striking on the
cells of each, summoning them to prayer or some work, every one eagerly
dashes out from his cell, so that one who is practising the writer’s
art, although he may have just begun to form a letter, does not venture
to finish it, but runs out with the utmost speed, at the very moment
when the sound of the knocking reaches his ears, without even waiting to
finish the letter he has begun; but, leaving the lines of the letter
incomplete, he aims not at abridging and saving his labour, but rather
hastens with the utmost earnestness and zeal to attain the virtue of
obedience, which they put not merely before manual labour and reading
and silence and quietness in the cell, but even before all virtues, so
that they consider that everything should be postponed to it, and are
content to undergo any amount of inconvenience if only it may be seen
that they have in no way neglected this virtue. <span

<span id="iv.iii.iv.xii-p3"></span> Cf. the Rule of S. Benedict, c. v.:
“Those who choose to tread the path that leads to life eternal
immediately quit their private occupations at the call of obedience,
and, renouncing their own will so far as to cast away unfinished out of
their hands whatever they may be occupied with, hasten to execute the
orders of their superiors,” etc.

anything, however trifling, is his own.](2110342)
