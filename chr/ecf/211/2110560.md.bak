#### <span id="iv.iii.xii.xxix-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXIX.

<span id="iv.iii.xii.xxix-p1"></span>The signs by which you can
recognize the presence of carnal pride in a soul.

<span id="iv.iii.xii.xxix-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.xii.xxix-p2.1"></span>And</span> to draw together briefly
what has been said of this kind of pride, by collecting, as well as we
can, some of its signs that we may somehow convey to those who are
thirsting for instruction in perfection, an idea of its characteristics
from the movements of the outward man: I think it well to unfold them in
a few words that we may conveniently recognize the signs by which we can
discern and detect it, that when the roots of this passion are laid bare
and brought to the surface, and seen and traced out with ocular
demonstration, they may be the more easily plucked up and avoided. For
only then will this most pestilent evil be altogether escaped, and if we
do not begin too late in the day, when it has already got the mastery
over us, to be on our guard against its dangerous heat and noxious
influence, but if, recognizing its symptoms (so to speak) beforehand, we
take precautions against it with wise and careful forethought. For, as
we said before, you can tell a man’s inward condition from his outward
gait.  By these signs, then, that carnal pride, of which we spoke
earlier, is shown. To begin with, in conversation the man’s voice is
loud: in his silence there is bitterness: in his mirth his laughter is
noisy and excessive: when he is serious he is unreasonably gloomy: in
his answers there is rancour: he is too free with his tongue, his words
tumbling out at random without being weighed. He is utterly lacking in
patience, and without charity: impudent in offering insults to others,
faint-hearted in bearing them himself: troublesome in the matter of
obedience except where his own wishes and likings correspond with his
duty: unforgiving in receiving admonition: weak in giving up his own
wishes: very stubborn about yielding to those of others: always trying
to compass his own ends, and never ready to give them up for others: and
thus the result is that though he is incapable of giving sound advice,
yet in everything he prefers his own opinion to that of the elders.
