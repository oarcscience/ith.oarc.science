#### <span id="iv.vi.viii.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.

<span id="iv.vi.viii.iv-p1"></span>What sorts of work should be chosen
by solitaries.

<span id="iv.vi.viii.iv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.viii.iv-p2.1"></span>Everyone</span> therefore who constantly
perseveres in this watchfulness will effectually fulfil what is very
plainly expressed by the prophet Habakkuk: “I will stand upon my watch,
and ascend upon the rock, and will look out to see what He shall say to
me, and what I may answer to Him that reproveth me.” <span
id="fr_2302"></span>[2303](#fn_2302.md) And how difficult and tiresome this
is, is very clearly shown by the experience of those who live in the
desert of Calamus or Porphyrion. <span
id="fr_2303"></span>[2304](#fn_2303.md) For though they are separated from
all the cities and dwellings of men by a longer stretch of desert than
the wilderness of Scete (since by penetrating seven or eight days’
journey into the recesses of the vast wilderness, they scarcely arrive
at their hiding places and cells) yet because there they are devoted to
agriculture and not in the least confined to the cloister, whenever they
come to these squalid districts in which we are living, or to Scete,
they are annoyed by such harassing thoughts and such anxiety of mind
that, as if they were beginners and men who had never given the
slightest attention to the exercises of solitude, they cannot endure the
life of the cells and the peace and quietness of them, and are at once
driven forth and obliged to leave them, as if they were inexperienced
and novices. For they have not learnt to still the motions of the inner
man, and to quell the tempests of their thoughts by anxious care and
persevering efforts, as, toiling day after day in work in the open air,
they are moving about all day long in empty space, not only in the flesh
but also in heart; and pour forth their thoughts openly as the body
moves hither and thither. And therefore they do not notice the folly of
their mind in longing for many things, nor can they put a check upon its
vague discursiveness; and as they cannot bear sorrow of spirit they
think that the fact of a continuance of silence is unendurable, and
those who are never tired by hard work in the country, are beaten by
silence and worn out by the length of their rest.
