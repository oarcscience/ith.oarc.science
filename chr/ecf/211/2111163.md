#### <span id="iv.vii.vii.xii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XII.

<span id="iv.vii.vii.xii-p1"></span>Christ crucified is an offence and
foolishness to those who declare that He was a mere man.

<span id="iv.vii.vii.xii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.vii.xii-p2.1"></span>The</span> shock then to your hearing
and ears is that God was born, and God suffered. And where is that
saying of yours, O Apostle Paul: “But we preach Christ crucified, to the
Jews indeed a stumbling block, but to the Gentiles foolishness: but to
them that are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the Power of God and
the Wisdom of God.” <span id="fr_2560"></span>[2561](#fn_2560) What is
the Wisdom and Power of God? Certainly it is God. But he preaches Christ
who was crucified, as the Power and Wisdom of God. If then Christ is
without any doubt the Wisdom of God, He is therefore without any doubt
God. “We,” then, he says, “preach Christ crucified, to the Jews indeed a
stumbling block, but to the Gentiles foolishness.” And so the Lord’s
cross, which was foolishness to the Gentiles and a stumbling block to
the Jews is both together to you. Nor indeed is there any greater
foolishness than not to believe, or any greater stumbling block than to
refuse to listen. Their ears were wounded then by the preaching and the
passion of God, just as yours are wounded now. They thought as you think
that this shocked their ears. And hence it was that when the Apostle was
preaching Christ as God, at the name of our God and Lord Jesus Christ,
they stopped the ears in their head, as you stop the ears of your
understanding. The sin of both of you in this matter might seem to be
equal, were it not that your fault is the greater, because they denied
Him, in whom the passion still showed the manhood, <span
id="fr_2561"></span>[2562](#fn_2561) while you deny Him, whom the
resurrection has already proved to be God. And so they were persecuting
Him on the earth, whom you are persecuting even in heaven. And not only
so, but this is more cruel and wicked, because *they* denied Him in
ignorance, *you* deny Him after having received the faith: *they* not
knowing the Lord, *you* when you have confessed Him as God: *they* under
cover of zeal for the law, *you* under the cloke of your Bishopric:
*they* denied Him to whom they thought that they were strangers, *you*
deny Him whose priest you are. O unworthy act, and one never heard of
before! You persecute and attack the very One, whose office you are
still holding.
