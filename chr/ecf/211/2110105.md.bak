#### <span id="ii.v.i.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.

<span id="ii.v.i.v-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.i.v-p1.1"></span>After</span> him, there will stand up David
worthy of his descendant the Lord, and declare: “I, Lord, proclaimed
thee by every means; I set forth that only thy name was to be worshiped;
I said, ‘Blessed is the man <span id="fr_152"></span>[153](#fn_152.md) who
fears the Lord’; I said too, ‘The saints shall <span
id="fr_153"></span>[154](#fn_153.md) be joyful in glory’; and I said, ‘The
desire of the <span id="page_57">p. 57</span> <span
id="ii.v.i.v-Page_57"></span>wicked <span
id="fr_154"></span>[155](#fn_154.md) shall perish,’ that these people might
acknowledge thee and cease to sin. I, when I had become possessed of
royal power, clothed in sackcloth, with dust spread beneath me, and with
the emblems of my greatness laid aside, lay down in my clothes, that an
example might be given to these people of gentleness and humility. I
spared my enemies who desired to slay me, that these people might
approve of my mercifulness, as worthy of being imitated.” After him,
Isaiah, who was worthy of the Spirit of God, will not be silent; but
will say: “I, Lord, whilst thou wast speaking through my mouth, gave
this warning,—‘Woe to those <span id="fr_155"></span>[156](#fn_155.md) who
join house to house,’ that I might set a limit to covetousness. I bore
witness that thine anger came upon the wicked, that at any rate fear of
punishment, if not hope of reward, might keep back these people from
their evil deeds.”
