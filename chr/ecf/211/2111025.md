<span id="iv.vi.v.xxv-p1"></span>The answer to the effect that the fast
of Lent has reference to the tithe of the year.

<span id="iv.vi.v.xxv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.v.xxv-p2.1"></span>Theonas</span>: Although the pious
simplicity of some folks would put aside a question on this subject, yet
because you are more scrupulous in your examination of those things
which another would consider unworthy to be asked about, and want to
know the whole truth of this observance of ours and the secret of it,
you shall have a very clear reason for this also, that you may still
more plainly be convinced that our predecessors taught nothing
unreasonable. By the law of Moses the command propounded to all the
people generally was this: “Thou shalt offer to the Lord thy God thy
tithes and firstfruits.” <span id="fr_2206"></span>[2207](#fn_2206) And
so, while we are commanded to offer tithes of our substance and all our
fruits, it is much more needful for us to offer tithes of our life and
ordinary employments and actions, which certainly is clearly arranged
for in the calculation of Lent. For the tithe of the number of all the
days included in the revolving circle of the year is thirty-six days and
a half. But in seven weeks, if Sundays and Saturdays are subtracted,
there remain thirty-five days assigned for fasting. But by the addition
of Easter Eve when the Saturday’s fast is prolonged to the cock-crowing
at the dawn of Easter Day, not only is the number of thirty-six days
made up, but in regard to the tithe of the five days which seemed to be
over, if the bit of the night which was added be taken into account
nothing will be wanting to the whole sum.
