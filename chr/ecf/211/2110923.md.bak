#### <span id="iv.v.viii.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.

<span id="iv.v.viii.iii-p1"></span>My ideas on this subject.

<span id="iv.v.viii.iii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.viii.iii-p2.1"></span>Then</span> I replied: The counsel or
rather the authority of the Elder to whom we ought to <span
id="page_461">p. 461</span> <span
id="iv.v.viii.iii-Page_461"></span>refer our anxieties would make a
short way out of our difficulties, and whatever is decided by his
verdict, may, like a divine and heavenly reply, put an end to all our
troubles. And we need not have any doubt of what is given to us by the
Lord through the lips of this Elder, both for the sake of his merits and
for our own faith. For by His gift believers have often obtained saving
counsel from unworthy people, and unbelievers from saints, as the Lord
grants this either on account of the merit of those who answer, or on
account of the faith of those who ask advice. And so the holy Abbot
Germanus caught eagerly at these words as if I had uttered them not of
myself but at the prompting of the Lord, and when we had waited a little
for the coming of the Elder and the approaching hour of the nocturnal
service, after we had welcomed him with the usual greeting and finished
reciting the right number of Psalms and prayers, we sat down again as
usual on the same mats on which we had settled ourselves to sleep.
