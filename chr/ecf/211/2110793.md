#### <span id="iv.iv.x.xxiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXIII.

<span id="iv.iv.x.xxiii-p1"></span>Of the clause: “Lead us not into
temptation.”

<span id="iv.iv.x.xxiii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.x.xxiii-p2.1"></span>Next</span> there follows: “And lead us
not into temptation,” on which there arises no unimportant question, for
if we pray that we may not be suffered to be tempted, how then will our
power of endurance be proved, according to this text: “Every one who is
not tempted is not proved;” <span id="fr_1615"></span>[1616](#fn_1615.md)
and again: “Blessed is the man that endureth temptation?” <span
id="fr_1616"></span>[1617](#fn_1616.md) The clause then, “Lead us not into
temptation,” does not mean this; viz., do not permit us ever to be
tempted, but do not permit us when we fall into temptation to be
overcome. For Job was tempted, but was not led into temptation. For he
did not ascribe folly to God nor blasphemy, nor with impious mouth did
he yield to that wish of the tempter toward which he was drawn. Abraham
was tempted, Joseph was tempted, but neither of them was led into
temptation for neither of them yielded his consent to the tempter. Next
there follows: “But deliver us from evil,” i.e., do not suffer us to be
tempted by the devil above that we <span id="page_396">p. 396</span>
<span id="iv.iv.x.xxiii-Page_396"></span>are able, but “make with the
temptation a way also of escape that we may be able to bear it.” <span
id="fr_1617"></span>[1618](#fn_1617.md)
