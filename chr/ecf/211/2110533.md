#### <span id="iv.iii.xii.ii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.

<span id="iv.iii.xii.ii-p1"></span>How there are two kinds of pride.

<span id="iv.iii.xii.ii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.xii.ii-p2.1"></span>And</span> of this pride there are two
kinds: the one, that by which we said that the best of men and
spiritually minded ones were troubled; the other, that which assaults
even beginners and carnal persons. And though each kind of pride is
excited with regard to both God and man by a dangerous elation, yet that
first kind more particularly has to do with God; the second refers
especially to men. Of the origin of this last and the remedies for it we
will by God’s help treat as far as possible in the latter part of this
book. We now propose to say a few things about that former kind, by
which, as I mentioned before, those who are perfect are especially
tried.
