#### <span id="iv.iii.iv.xlii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XLII.

<span id="iv.iii.iv.xlii-p1"></span>How a monk should not look for the
blessing of patience in his own case as a result of the virtue of
others, but rather as a consequence of his own longsuffering.

<span id="iv.iii.iv.xlii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.iv.xlii-p2.1"></span>You</span> should therefore not look for
patience in your own case from the virtue of others, thinking that then
only can you secure it when you are not irritated by any (for it is not
in your own power to prevent this from happening); but rather you should
look for it as the consequence of your own humility and long-suffering
which *does* depend on your own will.
