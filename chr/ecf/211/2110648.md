#### <span id="iv.iv.v.vii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.

<span id="iv.iv.v.vii-p1"></span>Of the value of the conflict which the
Apostle makes to consist in the strife between the flesh and the spirit.

<span id="iv.iv.v.vii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.v.vii-p2.1"></span>This</span> conflict too we read in the
Apostle has for our good been placed in our members: “For the flesh
lusteth against the spirit: and the spirit against the flesh. But these
two are opposed to each other so that ye should not do what ye
would.” <span id="fr_1292"></span>[1293](#fn_1292.md) You have here too a
contest as it were implanted in our bodies, by the action and
arrangement of the Lord. For when a thing exists in everybody
universally and without the slightest exception, what else can you think
about it except that it belongs to the substance of human nature, since
the fall of the first man, as it were naturally: and when a thing is
found to be congenital with everybody, and to grow with their growth,
how can we help believing that it was implanted by the will of the Lord,
not to injure them but to help them? But the reason of this conflict;
viz., of flesh and spirit, he tells us is this: that ye should not do
what ye would.” And so, if we fulfil what God arranged that we should
not fulfil, i.e., that we should not do what we liked, how can we help
<span id="page_333">p. 333</span> <span
id="iv.iv.v.vii-Page_333"></span>believing that it is bad for us? And
this conflict implanted in us by the arrangement of the Creator is in a
way useful to us, and calls and urges us on to a higher state: and if it
ceased, most surely there would ensue on the other hand a peace that is
fraught with danger.

chapter, after he has spoken of the lusts of the flesh and spirit
opposing one another, he adds a third thing; viz., man's will.](2110649.md)
