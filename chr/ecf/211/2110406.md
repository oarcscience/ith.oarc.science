#### <span id="iv.iii.v.xxxiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXIII.

<span id="iv.iii.v.xxxiii-p1"></span>Of the solution of a question which
Abbot Theodore obtained by prayer.

<span id="iv.iii.v.xxxiii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.v.xxxiii-p2.1"></span>We</span> knew also Abbot
Theodore, <span id="fr_868"></span>[869](#fn_868) a man gifted with the
utmost holiness and with perfect knowledge not only in practical life,
but also in understanding the Scriptures, which he had not acquired so
much by study and reading, or worldly education, as by purity of heart
alone: since he could with difficulty understand and speak but a very
few words of the Greek language. This man when he was seeking an
explanation of some most difficult question, continued without ceasing
for seven days and nights in prayer until he discovered by a revelation
from the Lord the solution of the question propounded.

<span id="iv.iii.v.xxxiii-p3"></span> Nothing further is known for
certain of this Theodore. He may be the author of the VIth of the
Conferences; but must be carefully distinguished from his more
celebrated namesake, the friend of Pachomius, and third Abbot of
Tabenna, who died before Cassian’s visit to Egypt.

he taught by what efforts a monk can acquire a knowledge of the
Scriptures.](2110407)
