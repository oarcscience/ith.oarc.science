#### <span id="iv.iii.v.xxvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXVI.

<span id="iv.iii.v.xxvi-p1"></span>Of another old man, who never partook
of food alone in his cell.

<span id="iv.iii.v.xxvi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.v.xxvi-p2.1"></span>We</span> have seen another who lived
alone, who declared that he had never enjoyed food by himself alone, but
that even if for five days running none of the brethren came to his cell
he constantly put off taking food until on Saturday or Sunday he went to
church for service and found some stranger whom he brought home at once
to his cell, and together with him partook of refreshment for the body
not so much by reason of his own needs, as for the sake of kindness and
on his brother’s account. And so as they know that the daily fast is
broken without scruple on the arrival of brethren, when they leave, they
compensate for the refreshment which has been enjoyed on their account
by a greater abstinence, and sternly make up for the reception of even a
very little food by a severer chastisement not only as regards bread,
but also by lessening their usual amount of sleep.
