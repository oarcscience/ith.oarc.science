#### <span id="iv.iv.x.xxxv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXV.

<span id="iv.iv.x.xxxv-p1"></span>Of prayer to be offered within the
chamber and with the door shut.

<span id="iv.iv.x.xxxv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.x.xxxv-p2.1"></span>Before</span> all things however we ought
most carefully to observe the Evangelic precept, which tells us to enter
into our chamber and shut the door and pray to our Father, which may be
fulfilled by us as follows: We pray within our chamber, when removing
our hearts inwardly from the din of all thoughts and anxieties, we
disclose our prayers in secret and in closest intercourse to the Lord.
We pray with closed doors when with closed lips and complete silence we
pray to the searcher not of words but of hearts. We pray in secret when
from the heart and fervent mind we disclose our petitions to God alone,
so that no hostile powers are even able to discover the character of our
petition. Wherefore we should pray in complete silence, not only to
avoid distracting the brethren standing near by our whispers or louder
utterances, and disturbing the thoughts of those who are praying, but
also that the purport of our petition may be concealed from our enemies
who are especially on the watch against us while we are praying. For so
we shall fulfil this injunction: “Keep the doors of thy mouth from her
who sleepeth in thy bosom.” <span id="fr_1657"></span>[1658](#fn_1657)
