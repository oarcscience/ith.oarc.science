#### <span id="iv.iv.x.xxxii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXII.

<span id="iv.iv.x.xxxii-p1"></span>Of the proof of prayer being heard.

<span id="iv.iv.x.xxxii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.x.xxxii-p2.1"></span>When</span>, while we are praying, no
hesitation intervenes and breaks down the confidence of our petition by
a sort of despair, but we feel that by pouring forth our prayer we have
obtained what we are asking for, we have no doubt that our prayers have
effectually reached God. For so far will one be heard and obtain an
answer, as he believes that he is regarded by God, and that God can
grant it. For this saying of our Lord cannot be retracted: “Whatsoever
ye ask when ye pray, believe that you shall receive, and they shall come
to you.” <span id="fr_1628"></span>[1629](#fn_1628)
