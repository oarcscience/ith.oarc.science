#### <span id="iv.vi.v.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.

<span id="iv.vi.v.iv-p1"></span>How Abraham, David, and other saints
went beyond the requirement of the law.

<span id="iv.vi.v.iv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.v.iv-p2.1"></span>For</span> so we read that Abraham went
beyond the requirement of the law which was afterwards to be given, when
after his victory over the four kings, he would not touch any of the
spoils of Sodom, which were fairly due to him as the conqueror, and
which indeed the king himself, whose spoils he had rescued, offered him;
and with an oath by the Divine name he exclaimed: “I lift up my hand to
the Lord Most High, who made heaven and earth, that I will not take from
a thread to a shoe’s latchet of all that is thine.” <span
id="fr_2163"></span>[2164](#fn_2163.md) So we know that David went beyond
the requirement of the law, as, though Moses commanded that vengeance
should be taken on enemies, <span id="fr_2164"></span>[2165](#fn_2164.md)
he not only did not do this, but actually embraced his persecutors with
love, and piously entreated the Lord for them, and wept bitterly and
avenged them when they were slain. So we are sure that Elijah and
Jeremiah were not under the law, as though they might without blame have
taken advantage of lawful matrimony, yet they preferred to remain
virgins. So we read that Elisha and others of the same mode of life went
beyond the commands of Moses, as of them the Apostle speaks as follows:
“They went about in sheepskins and in goatskins, they were oppressed,
afflicted, in want, of whom the world was not worthy, they wandered
about in deserts and in mountains, and in caves and in dens of the
earth.” <span id="fr_2165"></span>[2166](#fn_2165.md) What shall I say of
the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab, of whom we are told that, when at
the Lord’s bidding the prophet Jeremiah offered them wine, they replied:
“We drink no wine: for Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, commanded
us, saying: Ye shall drink no wine, ye and your sons forever: and ye
shall build no house, nor sow any seed, nor plant vineyards nor possess
them: but ye shall dwell in tents all your days”? Wherefore also they
were permitted to hear from the same prophet these words: “Thus saith
the Lord God of hosts, the God of Israel: there shall not fail a man
from the stock of Jonadab the son of Rechab to stand in My sight all the
days;” <span id="fr_2166"></span>[2167](#fn_2166.md) as all of them were
not satisfied with merely offering tithes of their possessions, but
actually refused property, and offered the rather to God themselves and
their souls, for which no redemption can be made by man, as the Lord
testifies in the gospel: “For what shall a man give in exchange for his
own soul?” <span id="fr_2167"></span>[2168](#fn_2167.md)
