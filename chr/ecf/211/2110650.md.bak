#### <span id="iv.iv.v.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.

<span id="iv.iv.v.ix-p1"></span>The answer on the understanding of one
who asks rightly.

<span id="iv.iv.v.ix-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.v.ix-p2.1"></span>Daniel</span>: It belongs to the
understanding to discern the distinctions and the drift of questions;
and it is a main part of knowledge to understand how ignorant you are.
Wherefore it is said that “if a fool asks questions, it will be
accounted wisdom,” <span id="fr_1293"></span>[1294](#fn_1293.md) because,
although one who asks questions is ignorant of the answer to the
question raised, yet as he wisely asks, and learns what he does not
know, this very fact will be counted as wisdom in him, because he wisely
discovers what he was ignorant of. According then to this division of
yours, it seems that in this passage the Apostle mentions three things,
the lust of the flesh against the spirit, and of the spirit against the
flesh, the mutual struggle of which against each other appears to have
this as its cause and reason; viz., “that,” says he, “we should not do
what we would.” There remains then a fourth case, which you have
overlooked; viz., that we should do what we would not. Now then, we must
first discover the meaning of those two desires, i.e., of the flesh and
spirit, and so next learn to discuss our free will, which is placed
between the two, and then lastly in the same way we can see what cannot
belong to our free will.
