#### <span id="iv.iv.vi.vii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.vii-p1"></span>How vainglory and pride can be
consummated without any assistance from the body.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.vii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.vi.vii-p2.1"></span>And</span> to go on in the order which we
proposed, with our account of the way in which the other passions act
(our analysis of which was obliged to be interrupted by this account of
gluttony and of the Lord’s temptation) vainglory and pride can be
consummated even without the slightest assistance from the body. For in
what way do those passions need any action of the flesh, which bring
ample destruction on the soul they take captive simply by its assent and
wish to gain praise and glory from men? Or what act on the part of the
body was there in that pride of old in the case of the above mentioned
Lucifer; as he only conceived it in his heart and mind, as the prophet
tells us: “Who saidst in thine heart: I will ascend into heaven, I will
set my throne above the stars of God. I will ascend above the heights of
the clouds, I will be like the most High.” <span
id="fr_1326"></span>[1327](#fn_1326) And just as he had no one to stir
him up to this pride, so his thoughts alone were the authors of the sin
when complete and of his eternal fall; especially as no exercise of the
dominion at which he aimed followed.
