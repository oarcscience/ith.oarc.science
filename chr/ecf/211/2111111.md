<span id="iv.vii.iv.vii"></span>

#### <span id="iv.vii.iv.vii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.

<span id="iv.vii.iv.vii-p1"></span>He shows once more by other passages
of the Apostle that Christ is God.

<span id="iv.vii.iv.vii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.iv.vii-p2.1"></span>I want</span> you to tell me, you
heretic, whether in this passage He who, as the Apostle tells us, speaks
in him, is man or God. If He is man, how can another’s body speak in his
heart? If God, then Christ is not a man but God; for since Christ spoke
in the Apostle, and only God could speak in him, therefore a Divine
Christ spoke in him. And so you see that there is nothing to be said
here, that no division or separation can be made between Christ and God:
because complete Divinity was in Christ, and Christ was completely in
God. No division or severing of the two can here be admitted. There is
only one simple, pious, and sound confession to be made; viz., to adore,
love, and worship Christ as God. But do you want to understand more
fully and thoroughly that there is no separation to be made between God
and Christ, and that we must hold that God is altogether one with
Christ? Hear what the Apostle says to the Corinthians: “For we must all
be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ, that every one may
receive the proper things of the body, according as he hath done,
whether it be good or evil.” <span id="fr_2430"></span>[2431](#fn_2430)
But in another passage, in writing to the Romans he says: “We shall all
stand before the judgment seat of God: for it is written: As I live,
saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall
confess to God.” <span id="fr_2431"></span>[2432](#fn_2431) You see then
that the judgment seat of God is the same as that of Christ; understand
then without any doubt that Christ is God; and when you see that the
substance of God and Christ is altogether inseparable, admit also that
the Person cannot be severed. Unless forsooth because the Apostle in one
Epistle said that we should be manifested before the judgment seat of
Christ, and in another before that of God, you invent two judgment
seats, and fancy that some will be judged by Christ and others by God.
But this is foolish and wild, and madder than a madman’s utterances.
Acknowledge then the Lord of all, the God of the universe, acknowledge
the judgment seat of God in the judgment seat of Christ. Love life, love
your salvation, love Him by whom you were created. Fear Him by whom you
are to be judged. For whether you will or no, you have to be manifested
before the judgment seat of Christ, and laying aside wicked blasphemy
and the childish talk of unbelieving words, though you think that the
judgment seat of God is different from that of Christ, you will come
before the judgment seat of Christ, and will find by evidence that there
is no gainsaying, that the judgment seat of God is indeed the same as
that of Christ, and that in Christ the Son of God, there is all the
glory of God the Son, and the power of God the <span id="page_567">p.
567</span> <span id="iv.vii.iv.vii-Page_567"></span>Father. “For the
Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment to the Son, that
all men may honour the Son as they honour the Father.” <span
id="fr_2432"></span>[2433](#fn_2432) For whoever denies the Father
denies the Son also. “Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the
Father: he that confesseth the Son, hath the Father also.” <span
id="fr_2433"></span>[2434](#fn_2433) And so you should learn that the
glory of the Father and the Son is inseparable, and their majesty is
inseparable also and that the Son cannot be honoured without the Father,
nor the Father without the Son. But no man can honour God and the Son of
God except in Christ the only-begotten Son of God. For it is impossible
for a man to have the Spirit of God who is to be honoured except in the
Spirit of Christ, as the Apostle says: “But ye are not in the flesh, but
in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. But if any
man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of His.” <span
id="fr_2434"></span>[2435](#fn_2434) And again: “Who shall lay anything
to the charge of God’s elect? It is God that justifieth. Who is he that
condemneth? It is Christ Jesus who died, yea rather who rose
again.” <span id="fr_2435"></span>[2436](#fn_2435) You see then now,
even against your will, that there is absolutely no difference between
the Spirit of God and the Spirit of Christ, or between the judgment of
God and the judgment of Christ. Choose then which you will—for one of
the two must happen—either acknowledge in faith that Christ is God, or
admit that God is in Christ at your condemnation.
