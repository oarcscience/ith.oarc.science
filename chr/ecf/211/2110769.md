#### <span id="iv.iv.ix.xxv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXV.

<span id="iv.iv.ix.xxv-p1"></span>How this that is said of the devil in
the gospel is to be understood; viz., that “he is a liar, and his
father.”

<span id="iv.iv.ix.xxv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.ix.xxv-p2.1"></span>But</span> as for this which disturbed you
about the devil, that “he is a liar and his father,” <span
id="fr_1571"></span>[1572](#fn_1571) as if it seemed that he and his
father were pronounced by the Lord to be liars, it is sufficiently
ridiculous to imagine this even cursorily. For as we said a little while
ago spirit does not beget spirit just as soul cannot procreate soul,
though we do not doubt that the compacting of flesh is formed from man’s
seed, as the Apostle clearly distinguishes in the case of both
substances; viz., flesh and spirit, what should be ascribed to whom as
its author, and says: “Moreover we have had fathers of our flesh for
instructors, and we reverenced them: shall we not much more be in
subjection to the Father of spirits and live?” <span
id="fr_1572"></span>[1573](#fn_1572) What could show more clearly than
this distinction, that he laid down that men were the fathers of our
flesh, but always taught that God alone was the Father of souls.
Although even in the actual compacting of this body a ministerial office
alone must be attributed to men, but the chief part of its formation to
God the Creator of all, as David says: “Thy hands have made me and
fashioned me:” <span id="fr_1573"></span>[1574](#fn_1573) And the
blessed Job: “Hast thou not milked me as milk, and curdled me as cheese?
Thou hast put me together with bones and sinews;” <span
id="fr_1574"></span>[1575](#fn_1574) and the Lord to Jeremiah: “Before I
formed thee in the womb, I knew thee.” <span
id="fr_1575"></span>[1576](#fn_1575) But Ecclesiastes very clearly and
accurately gathers the nature of either substance, and its beginning, by
an examination of the rise and commencement, from which each originated,
and by a consideration of the end to which each is tending, and decides
also of the division of this body and soul, and discourses as follows:
“Before the dust returns to the earth as it was, and the spirit returns
unto God who gave it.” <span id="fr_1576"></span>[1577](#fn_1576) But
what could be said with greater plainness than that he declares that the
matter of the flesh which he styled dust, because it springs from the
seed of man, and seems to be sown by his ministration, must, as it was
taken from the earth, again return to the earth, while he points out
that the spirit which is not begotten by intercourse between the sexes,
but belongs to God alone in a special way, returns to its creator? And
this also is clearly implied in that breathing by God, through which
Adam in the first instance received his life. And so from these passages
we clearly infer that no one can be called the Father of spirits but God
alone, who makes them out of nothing whenever He pleases, while men can
only be termed the fathers of our flesh. So then the devil also in as
much as he was created a spirit or an angel and good, had no one as his
Father but God his Maker. But when he had become puffed up by pride and
had said in his heart: “I will ascend above the heights of the clouds, I
will be like the Most High,” <span id="fr_1577"></span>[1578](#fn_1577)
he became a liar, and “abode not in the truth;” <span
id="fr_1578"></span>[1579](#fn_1578) but brought forth a lie from his
own storehouse of wickedness and so became not only a liar, but also the
father of the actual lie, by which when he promised Divinity to man and
said “Ye shall be as gods,” <span id="fr_1579"></span>[1580](#fn_1579)
he abode not in the truth, but from the beginning became a murderer,
both by bringing Adam into a state of mortality, and by slaying Abel by
the hand of his brother at his suggestion. But already the approach of
dawn is bringing to a close our discussion, which has occupied nearly
two whole nights, and our brief and simple words have drawn our bark of
this Conference from the deep sea of questions to a safe harbour of
silence, in which deep indeed, as the breath of the Divine Spirit drives
us further in, so is there ever opened out a wider and boundless space
reaching beyond the sight of our eye, and, as Solomon says, “It will
become much further from us than it was, and a great depth; who shall
find it out?” <span id="fr_1580"></span>[1581](#fn_1580) Wherefore let
us pray the Lord that both His fear and His love, which cannot fail, may
continue steadfast in us, and make us wise in all things, and ever
shield us unharmed, from the darts <span id="page_387">p. 387</span>
<span id="iv.iv.ix.xxv-Page_387"></span>of the devil. For with these
guards it is impossible for anyone to fall into the snares of death. But
there is this difference between the perfect and imperfect, that in the
case of the former love is steadfast, and so to speak riper and lasts
more abidingly and so makes them persevere in holiness more steadfastly
and more easily, while in the case of the latter its position is weaker
and it more easily grows cold, and so quickly and more frequently allows
them to be entangled in the snares of sin. And when we heard this, the
words of this Conference so fired us that when we went away from the old
man’s cell we longed with a keener ardour of soul than when we first
came, for the fulfilment of his teaching.
