#### <span id="iv.iv.viii.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.

<span id="iv.iv.viii.iv-p1"></span>The discourse of the old man on the
state of the soul and its excellence.

<span id="iv.iv.viii.iv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.viii.iv-p2.1"></span>Serenus</span>: It is dangerous to jump
to a conclusion and lay down the law hastily on the nature of anything
before you have properly discussed the subject and considered its true
character. Nor should you, looking only at your own weakness, hazard a
conjecture instead of pronouncing a judgment based on the character and
value of the practice itself, and others’ experience of it. For if
anyone, who was ignorant of swimming but knew that the weight of his
body could not be supported by water, wished from the proof which his
inexperience afforded, to lay down that no one composed of solid flesh
could possibly be supported on the liquid element, we ought not
therefore to think his opinion a true one, which he seemed to bring
forward in accordance with his own experience, since this can be shown
to be not merely not impossible but actually extremely easily done by
others, by the clearest proofs and ocular demonstration. And so the
<span class="Greek"><span id="iv.iv.viii.iv-p2.2"></span>νοῦς</span>,
i.e., the mind, is defined as <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iv.viii.iv-p2.3"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iv.viii.iv-p2.4"></span>εικίνητος καὶ πολυκίνητος</span>, i.e.,
ever shifting and very shifting: as it is thus described in the so
called wisdom of Solomon in other words: <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iv.viii.iv-p2.5"></span>καὶ γεῶδες σκῆνος βρίθει νοῦν
πολυφρόντιδα</span> , i.e., “And the earthly tabernacle weigheth down
the mind that museth on many things.” <span
id="fr_1436"></span>[1437](#fn_1436.md) This then in accordance with its
nature can never remain idle, but unless provision is made where it may
exercise its motions and have what will continually occupy it, it must
by its own fickleness wander about and stray over all kinds of things
until, accustomed by long practice and daily use—in which you say that
you have toiled without result—it tries and learns what food for the
memory it ought to prepare, toward which it may bring back its unwearied
flight and acquire strength for remaining, and thus may succeed in
driving away the hostile suggestion of the enemy by which it is
distracted, and in persisting in that state and condition which it
yearns for. We ought not then to ascribe this wandering inclination of
our heart either to human nature or to God its Creator. For it is a true
statement of Scripture, that “God made man upright; but they themselves
found out many thoughts.” <span id="fr_1437"></span>[1438](#fn_1437.md) The
character of these then depends on us ourselves, for it says “a good
thought comes near to those that know it, but a prudent man will find
it.” <span id="fr_1438"></span>[1439](#fn_1438.md) For where anything is
subject to our prudence and industry so that it can be found out, there
if it is *not* found out, we ought certainly to set it down to our own
laziness or carelessness and not to the fault of our nature. And with
this meaning the Psalmist also is in agreement, when he says: “Blessed
is the man whose help is from Thee: in his heart he hath disposed his
ascents.” <span id="fr_1439"></span>[1440](#fn_1439.md) You see then that
it lies in our power to dispose in our hearts either *ascents*, i.e.,
thoughts that belong to God, or *descents*; viz., those that sink down
to carnal and earthly things. And if this was not in our power the Lord
would not have rebuked the Pharisees, saying “Why do ye think evil in
your hearts?” <span id="fr_1440"></span>[1441](#fn_1440.md) nor would He
have given this charge by the prophet, saying: “Take away the evil of
your thoughts from mine eyes;” and “How long shall wicked thoughts
remain in you?” <span id="fr_1441"></span>[1442](#fn_1441.md) Nor would the
character of them as of our works be taken into consideration in the day
of judgment in our case as the Lord threatens by Isaiah: “Lo, I come to
gather together their works and thoughts together with all nations and
tongues;” <span id="fr_1442"></span>[1443](#fn_1442.md) nor would it be
right that we should be condemned or defended by their evidence in that
terrible and dreadful examination, as the blessed Apostle says: “Their
thoughts between themselves accusing or also defending one another, in
the day when God shall judge the secrets of men according to my
gospel.” <span id="fr_1443"></span>[1444](#fn_1443.md)
