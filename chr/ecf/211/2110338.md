#### <span id="iv.iii.iv.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.

<span id="iv.iii.iv.ix-p1"></span>The reason why the juniors are
enjoined not to keep back any of their thoughts from the senior.

<span id="iv.iii.iv.ix-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.iv.ix-p2.1"></span>By</span> these practices, then, they
hasten to impress and instruct those whom they are training with the
alphabet, as it were, and first syllables in the direction of
perfection, as they can clearly see by these whether they are grounded
in a false and imaginary or in a true humility. And, that they may
easily arrive at this, they are next taught not to conceal by a false
shame any itching thoughts in their hearts, but, as soon as ever such
arise, to lay them bare to the senior, and, in forming a judgment about
them, not to trust anything to their own discretion, but to take it on
trust that that is good or bad which is considered and pronounced so by
the examination of the senior. Thus it results that our cunning
adversary cannot in any way circumvent a young and inexperienced monk,
or get the better of his ignorance, or by any craft deceive one whom he
sees to be protected not by his own discretion but by that of his
senior, and who cannot be persuaded to hide from his senior those
suggestions of his which like fiery darts he has shot into his heart;
since the devil, subtle as he is, cannot ruin or destroy a junior unless
he has enticed him either through pride or through shame to conceal his
thoughts. For they lay it down as an universal and clear proof that a
thought is from the devil if we are ashamed to disclose it to the
senior. <span id="fr_762"></span>[763](#fn_762.md)

<span id="iv.iii.iv.ix-p3"></span> Compare the Conferences, Book II. c.
x., where Cassian returns to the same subject. A similar rule that the
brethren are to lay bare all the secrets of their hearts to their
superior is given, by S. Basil in the Longer Monastic Rules, Q. xxvi.,
and in the Rule of S. Isaiah (cc. vi., xliii.), printed in Holsten’s
*Codex Regularum*, Vol. I.

those things which are matters of common necessity.](2110339.md)
