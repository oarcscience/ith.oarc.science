#### <span id="iv.iv.x.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VIII.

<span id="iv.iv.x.viii-p1"></span>Of the different characters of prayer.

<span id="iv.iv.x.viii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.x.viii-p2.1"></span>Isaac</span>: I imagine that all kinds of
prayers cannot be grasped without great purity of heart and soul and the
illumination of the Holy Spirit. For there are as many of them as there
can be conditions and characters produced in one soul or rather in all
souls. And so although we know that owing to our dulness of heart we
cannot see all kinds of prayers, yet we will try to relate them in some
order, as far as our slender experience enables us to succeed. For
according to the degree of the purity to which each soul attains, and
the character of the state in which it is sunk owing to what happens to
it, or is by its own efforts renewing itself, its very prayers will each
moment be altered: and therefore it is quite clear that no one can
always offer up uniform prayers. For every one prays in one way when he
is brisk, in another when he is oppressed with a weight of sadness or
despair, in another when he is invigorated by spiritual achievements, in
another when cast down by the burden of attacks, in another when he is
asking pardon for his sins, in another when he asks to obtain grace or
some virtue or else prays for the destruction of some sin, in another
when he is pricked to the heart by the thought of hell and the fear of
future judgment, in another when he is aglow with the hope and desire of
good things to come, in another when he is taken up with affairs and
dangers, in another when he is in peace and security, in another when he
is enlightened by the revelation of heavenly mysteries, and in another
when he is depressed by a sense of barrenness in virtues and dryness in
feeling.
