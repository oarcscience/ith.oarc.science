<span id="iv.iii.ii.v"></span>

#### <span id="iv.iii.ii.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.

<span id="iv.iii.ii.v-p1"></span>How the fact that the number of the
Psalms was to be twelve was received from the teaching of an angel.

<span id="iv.iii.ii.v-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.ii.v-p2.1"></span>For</span> in the early days of the faith
when only a few, and those the best of men, were known by the name of
monks, who, as they received that mode of life from the Evangelist Mark
of blessed memory, the first to preside over the Church of Alexandria as
Bishop, not only preserved those grand characteristics for which we
read, in the Acts of the Apostles, that the Church and multitude of
believers in primitive times was famous (“The multitude of believers had
one heart and one soul. Nor did any of them say that any of the things
which he possessed was his own: but they had all things common; for as
many as were owners of lands or houses sold them, and brought the price
of the things which they sold, and laid it at the feet of the Apostles,
and distribution was made to every man as he had need”), <span
id="fr_682"></span>[683](#fn_682.md) but they added to these
characteristics others still more sublime. For withdrawing into more
secluded spots outside the cities they led a life marked by such
rigorous abstinence <span id="page_207">p. 207</span> <span
id="iv.iii.ii.v-Page_207"></span>that even to those of another creed the
exalted character of their life was a standing marvel. For they gave
themselves up to the reading of Holy Scripture and to prayers and to
manual labour night and day with such fervour that they had no desire or
thoughts of food—unless on the second or third day bodily hunger <span
id="fr_683"></span>[684](#fn_683.md) reminded them, and they took their
meat and drink not so much because they wished for it as because it was
necessary for life; and even then they took it not before sunset, in
order that they might connect the hours of daylight with the practice of
spiritual meditations, and the care of the body with the night, and
might perform other things much more exalted than these. And about these
matters, one who has never heard anything from one who is at home in
such things, may learn from ecclesiastical history. <span
id="fr_684"></span>[685](#fn_684.md) At that time, therefore, when the
perfection of the primitive Church remained unbroken, and was still
preserved fresh in the memory by their followers and successors, and
when the fervent faith of the few had not yet grown lukewarm by being
dispersed among the many, the venerable fathers with watchful care made
provision for those to come after them, and met together to discuss what
plan should be adopted for the daily worship throughout the whole body
of the brethren; that they might hand on to those who should succeed
them a legacy of piety and peace that was free from all dispute and
dissension, for they were afraid that in regard of the daily services
some difference or dispute might arise among those who joined together
in the same worship, and at some time or other it might send forth a
poisonous root of error or jealousy or schism among those who came
after. And when each man in proportion to his own fervour—and unmindful
of the weakness of others—thought that *that* should be appointed which
he judged was quite easy by considering his own faith and strength,
taking too little account of what would be possible for the great mass
of the brethren in general (wherein a very large proportion of weak ones
is sure to be found); and when in different degrees they strove, each
according to his own powers, to fix an enormous number of Psalms, and
some were for fifty, others sixty, and some, not content with this
number, thought that they actually ought to go beyond it,—there was such
a holy difference of opinion in their pious discussion on the rule of
their religion that the time for their Vesper office came before the
sacred question was decided; and, as they were going to celebrate their
daily rites and prayers, one rose up in the midst to chant the Psalms to
the Lord. And while they were all sitting (as is still the custom in
Egypt <span id="fr_685"></span>[686](#fn_685) .md), with their minds
intently fixed on the words of the chanter, when he had sung eleven
Psalms, separated by prayers introduced between them, verse after verse
being evenly enunciated, <span id="fr_686"></span>[687](#fn_686.md) he
finished the twelfth with a response of Alleluia, <span
id="fr_687"></span>[688](#fn_687.md) and then, by his sudden disappearance
from the eyes of all, put an end at once to their discussion and their
service. <span id="fr_688"></span>[689](#fn_688.md)

<span id="iv.iii.ii.v-p8"></span> So, according to the Benedictine rule,
the Psalms at mattins are ended with Alleluia (c. ix.): “After these
three lessons with their responds there shall follow the remaining six
Psalms with the Alleluia.” Cf. c. xi. and xv.

Eighteenth Canon of the Second Council of Tours, <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.ii.v-p9.1"></span>a.d.</span> 567. “The statutes of the
Fathers have prescribed that twelve Psalms be said at the Twelfth (i.e.
Vespers), with Alleluia, which, moreover, they learnt from the showing
of an angel.”
