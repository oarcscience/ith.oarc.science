#### <span id="ii.iv.i.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.

<span id="ii.iv.i.iv-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.i.iv-p1.1"></span>I therefore</span> bent my steps toward the
hut which I had beheld from a distance. There I find an old man, in a
garment made of skins, turning a mill with his hand. He saluted and
received us kindly. We explain to him that we had been forced to land on
that coast, and were prevented by the continued raging of the sea <span
id="fr_89"></span>[90](#fn_89) from being able at once to pursue our
voyage; that, having made our way on shore, we had desired, as is in
keeping with ordinary human <span id="page_26">p. 26</span> <span
id="ii.iv.i.iv-Page_26"></span>nature, to become acquainted with the
character of the locality, and the manners of the inhabitants. We added
that we were Christians, and that the principal object of our enquiry
was whether there were any Christians amid these solitudes. Then,
indeed, he, weeping for joy, throws himself at our feet; and, kissing us
over and over again, invites us to prayer, while, spreading on the
ground the skins of sheep, he makes us sit down upon them. He then
serves up a breakfast truly luxurious, <span
id="fr_90"></span>[91](#fn_90) consisting of the half of a barley cake.
Now, we were four, while he himself constituted the fifth. He also
brought in a bundle of herbs, of which I forget the name, but they were
like mint, were rich in leaves, and yielded a taste like honey. We were
delighted with the exceedingly sweet taste of this plant, and our hunger
was fully satisfied.”

<span id="ii.iv.i.iv-p4"></span>Upon this I smiled, and said to my
friend the Gaul, “What, Gaul, do you think of this? Are you pleased with
a bundle of herbs and half a barley cake as a breakfast for five men?”

<span id="ii.iv.i.iv-p5"></span>Then he, being an exceedingly modest
person, and blushing somewhat, while he takes my <span
id="fr_91"></span>[92](#fn_91) joke in good part, says, “You act,
Sulpitius, in a way like yourself, for you never miss any opportunity
which is offered you of joking us on the subject of our fondness for
eating. But it is unkind of you to try to force us Gauls to live after
the fashion of angels; and yet, through my own liking for eating, I
could believe that even the angels are in the habit of eating; for such
is my appetite that I would be afraid even singly to attack that half
barley cake. However, let that man of Cyrene be satisfied with it, to
whom it is either a matter of necessity or nature always to feel hungry;
or, again, let those be content with it from whom, I suppose, their
tossing at sea had taken away all desire for food. We, on the other
hand, are at a distance from the sea; and, as I have often testified to
you, we are, in one word, Gauls. But instead of wasting time over such
matters, let our friend here rather go on to complete his account of the
Cyrenian.”
