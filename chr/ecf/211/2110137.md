#### <span id="ii.vi.i.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.

<span id="ii.vi.i.iii-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.vi.i.iii-p1.1"></span>God</span> being offended by these things,
and especially by the wickedness of mankind, which had gone beyond
measure, had determined to destroy the whole human race. But he exempted
Noah, a righteous man and of blameless life, from the destined doom. He
being warned by God that a flood was coming upon the earth, built an ark
of wood of immense size, and covered it with pitch so as to render it
impervious to water. He was shut into it along with his wife, and his
three sons and his three daughters-in-law. Pairs of birds also and of
the different kinds of beasts were likewise received into it, while all
the rest were cut off by a flood. Noah then, when he understood that the
violence of the rain had ceased, and that the ark was quietly floating
on the deep, thinking (as really was the case) that the waters were
decreasing, sent forth first a raven for the purpose of enquiring into
the matter, and on its not returning, having settled, as I conjecture,
on the dead bodies, he then sent forth a dove. It, not finding a place
of rest, returned to him and being again sent out, it brought back an
olive leaf, in manifest proof that the tops of the trees were now to be
seen. Then being sent forth a third time, it returned no more, from
which it was understood that the waters had subsided; and Noah
accordingly went out from the ark. This was done, as I reckon, two
thousand two hundred <span id="fr_250"></span>[251](#fn_250) and
forty-two years after the beginning of the world.
