#### <span id="iv.vii.vii.xvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVII.

<span id="iv.vii.vii.xvii-p1"></span>Those who are under an error in one
point of the Catholic religion, lose the whole faith, and all the value
of the faith.

<span id="iv.vii.vii.xvii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.vii.xvii-p2.1"></span>And</span> since this is so, in denying
that Jesus Christ the Son of God is one, you have denied everything. For
the scheme of the mysteries of the Church and the Catholic faith is such
that one who denies one portion of the Sacred Mystery cannot confess the
other. For all parts of it are so bound up and united together that one
cannot stand without the other and if a man denies one point out of the
whole number, it is of no use for him to believe all the others. And so
if you deny that the Lord Jesus Christ is God, the result is that in
denying the Son of God you deny the Father also. For as St. John says:
“He who hath not the Son hath not the Father; but he who hath the Son
hath the Father also.” <span id="fr_2568"></span>[2569](#fn_2568.md) By
denying then Him who was begotten you deny also Him who begat. By
denying also that the Son of God was born in the flesh, you are led also
to deny that He was born in the Spirit, for it is the same Person who
was born in the flesh who was first born in the Spirit. If you do not
believe that He was born in the flesh, the result is that you do not
believe that He suffered. If you do not believe in His Passion what
remains for you but to deny His resurrection? For faith in one raised
springs out of faith in one dead. Nor can the reference to the
resurrection keep its place, unless belief in His death has first
preceded it. By denying then his Passion and Death, you deny also his
resurrection from hell. <span id="fr_2569"></span>[2570](#fn_2569.md) It
follows certainly that you deny His ascension also, for there cannot be
the ascension without the resurrection. And if we do not believe that He
rose again, we cannot either believe that He ascended: as the Apostle
says, “For He that descended is the same also that ascended.” <span
id="fr_2570"></span>[2571](#fn_2570.md) Thus, so far as you are concerned,
the Lord Jesus Christ did not rise from hell, nor ascend into heaven,
nor sit at the right hand of God the Father, nor will He come at that
day of judgment which we look for, nor will He judge the quick and the
dead.

whom he is disputing, and begs him to return to his senses. The
