#### <span id="iv.iii.viii.xiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIII.

<span id="iv.iii.viii.xiii-p1"></span>That we should not retain our
anger even for an instant.

<span id="iv.iii.viii.xiii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.viii.xiii-p2.1"></span>Or</span> how can we think that the
Lord would have it retained even for an instant, since He does not
permit us to offer the spiritual sacrifices of our prayers, if we are
aware that another has any bitterness against us: saying, “If then thou
bringest thy gift to the altar and there rememberest that thy brother
hath aught against thee, leave there thy gift at the altar and go thy
way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy
gift.” <span id="fr_939"></span>[940](#fn_939) How then may we retain
displeasure against our brother, I will not say for several days, but
even till the going down of the sun, if we are not allowed to offer our
prayers to God while he has anything against us? And yet we are
commanded by the Apostle: “Pray without ceasing;” <span
id="fr_940"></span>[941](#fn_940) and “in every place lifting up holy
hands without wrath and disputing.” <span
id="fr_941"></span>[942](#fn_941) It remains then either that we never
pray at all, retaining this poison in our hearts, and become guilty in
regard of this apostolic or evangelic charge, in which we are bidden to
pray everywhere and without ceasing; or else if, deceiving ourselves, we
venture to pour forth our prayers, contrary to His command, we must know
that we are offering to God no prayer, but an obstinate temper with a
rebellious spirit.
