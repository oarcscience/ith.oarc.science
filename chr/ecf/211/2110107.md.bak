#### <span id="ii.v.i.vii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.

<span id="ii.v.i.vii-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.i.vii-p1.1"></span>Then</span> will the Evangelist repeat this
to the wretched beings, “Go ye <span id="fr_159"></span>[160](#fn_159.md)
into outer darkness, where shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.” O ye
miserable men, whom these words do not now impress! They shall then see
their own punishment, and the glory of others. Let them use this present
world, provided they do not enjoy that eternity which is prepared for
the saints. Let them abound in riches: let them rest on gold; provided
that there they be found needy and destitute. Let them be wealthy in
this world, provided they be poor in eternity, for it is written
regarding them, “The rich were in <span
id="fr_160"></span>[161](#fn_160.md) want, and suffered hunger.” But the
Scripture has added what follows respecting the good,—“but those who
seek the Lord shall not want any good thing.”

<span id="ii.v.i.vii-p4"></span>Therefore, my sister, although those
people mock at us, and although they call us foolish and unhappy, let us
all the more joyfully exult in such reproaches, by which glory is heaped
up for us, and punishment for them. And do not let us laugh at their
folly, but rather grieve over their unhappiness; because there is among
them a large number of our own people, whom if we win over, our glory
shall be increased. But however they may conduct themselves, let <span
id="page_58">p. 58</span> <span id="ii.v.i.vii-Page_58"></span>them be
to us as Gentiles and publicans; but let us keep ourselves safe and
sound. If they rejoice now over us lamenting, it will be our turn
afterwards to rejoice over their suffering. Farewell, dearest sister,
and tenderly beloved in Christ.
