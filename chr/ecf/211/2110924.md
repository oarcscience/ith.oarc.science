#### <span id="iv.v.viii.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.

<span id="iv.v.viii.iv-p1"></span>Abbot Joseph’s question and our answer
on the origin of our anxiety.

<span id="iv.v.viii.iv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.viii.iv-p2.1"></span>Then</span> the venerable Joseph saw that
we were in rather low spirits, and, guessing that this was not the case
without reason, addressed us in these words of the patriarch Joseph:
“Why are your faces sad today?” <span
id="fr_2013"></span>[2014](#fn_2013.md) to whom we answered: We are not
like those bond slaves of Pharaoh who have seen a dream and there is
none to interpret it, but I admit that we have passed a sleepless night
and there is no one to lighten the weight of our troubles unless the
Lord may remove them by your wisdom. Then he, who recalled the
excellence of the patriarch both by his merits and name, said: Does not
the cure of man’s perplexities come from the Lord? Let them be brought
forward: for the Divine Compassion is able to give a remedy for them by
means of our advice according to your faith.
