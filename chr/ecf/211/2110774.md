#### <span id="iv.iv.x.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.

<span id="iv.iv.x.iv-p1"></span>Of the lightness of the soul which may
be compared to a wing or feather.

<span id="iv.iv.x.iv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.x.iv-p2.1"></span>For</span> the nature of the soul is not
inaptly compared to a very fine feather or very light wing, which, if it
has not been damaged or affected by being spoilt by any moisture falling
on it from without, is borne aloft almost naturally to the heights of
heaven by the lightness of its nature, and the aid of the slightest
breath: but if it is weighted by any moisture falling upon it and
penetrating into it, it will not only not be carried away by its natural
lightness into any aerial flights but will actually be borne down to the
depths of earth by the weight of the moisture it has received. So also
our soul, if it is not weighted with faults that touch it, and the cares
of this world, or damaged by the moisture of injurious lusts, will be
raised as it were by the natural blessing of its own purity and borne
aloft to the heights by the light breath of spiritual meditation; and
leaving things low and earthly will be transported to those that are
heavenly and invisible. Wherefore we are well warned by the Lord’s
command: “Take heed that your hearts be not weighed down by surfeiting
and drunkenness and the cares of this world.” <span
id="fr_1586"></span>[1587](#fn_1586) And therefore if we want our
prayers to reach not only the sky, but what is beyond the sky, let us be
careful to reduce our soul, purged from all earthly faults and purified
from every stain, to its natural lightness, that so our prayer may rise
to God unchecked by the weight of any sin.
