#### <span id="ii.v.ii.xiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIV.

<span id="ii.v.ii.xiv-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.ii.xiv-p1.1"></span>God</span> seeks for adornment of this
kind, and desires a soul arrayed in such a manner. Remember that you are
called the daughter of God, according to what he says, “Hearken, <span
id="fr_214"></span>[215](#fn_214) O daughter, and consider.” But you
yourself also, as often as you call God your Father, bear witness that
you are the daughter of God. Wherefore, if you are the daughter of God,
take care that you do none of those things which are unworthy of God,
your Father; but do all things as being the daughter of God. Reflect how
the daughters of nobles in this world conduct themselves, to what habits
they are accustomed and by what exercises they train themselves. In some
of them, there is so great modesty, so great dignity, so great
self-restraint, that they excel the habits of other human beings in
regard to human nobleness, and, lest they should attach any mark of
disgrace on their honorable parents by their failure, they strive to
acquire another <span id="fr_215"></span>[216](#fn_215) nature for
themselves by the mode of their acting in the world. And do you,
therefore, have regard to your origin, consider your descent, attend to
the glory of your nobility. Acknowledge that you are not merely the
daughter of man, but of God, and adorned with the nobility of a divine
birth. So present yourself to the world that your heavenly birth be seen
in you, and your divine nobleness shine clearly forth. Let there be in
you a new dignity, an admirable virtue, a notable modesty, a marvelous
patience, a gait becoming a virgin with a bearing of true
shamefacedness, speech always modest, and such as is uttered only at the
proper time, so that whosoever beholds you may admiringly exclaim: “What
is this exhibition of new dignity among men? What is this striking
modesty, what this well-balanced excellence, what this ripeness of
wisdom? This is not the outcome of human training or of mere human
discipline. Something heavenly sheds its fragrance on me in that earthly
body. I really believe that God does reside in some human beings.” And
when he comes to know that you are a handmaid of Christ, he will be
seized with the greater amazement, and will reflect how marvelous must
be the Master, when his handmaid manifests such excellence.
