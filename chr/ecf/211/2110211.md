#### <span id="ii.vi.ii.xxii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXII.

<span id="ii.vi.ii.xxii-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.vi.ii.xxii-p1.1"></span>Judah</span>, on the defeat of the enemy,
returned to Jerusalem, and bent his mind on the purification and
restoration of the temple, which having been overthrown by Antiochus,
and profaned by the Gentiles, presented a melancholy spectacle. But as
the Syrians held the citadel, which being connected with the temple, but
standing above it in position, was really impregnable, the lower parts
proved inaccessible, as frequent sallies from above prevented persons
from approaching them. But Judah placed against these assailants a very
powerful body of his men. Thus the work of the sacred building was
protected, and the temple was surrounded with a wall, while armed men
were appointed to maintain a perpetual defence. And Lysias, having again
returned into Judæa with increased forces, was once more defeated with a
great loss both of his own army and of the auxiliaries, which being sent
to him by various states had combined with him in the war. In the
meantime, Antiochus, who, as we have said above, had marched into
Persia, endeavored to plunder the town of Elymus, the wealthiest in the
country, and a temple situated there which was filled with gold; but, as
a multitude flocked together from all sides for the defense of the
place, he was put to flight. Moreover, he received news of the want of
success which had attended the efforts of Lysias. <span

into bodily disease. But as he was then tormented with internal
sufferings, he remembered the miseries which he had inflicted on the
people of God, and acknowledged that these evils had deservedly been
sent upon him. Then, after a few days, he died, having reigned eleven
years. He left the kingdom to his son Antiochus, to whom the name of
Eupator was given.

Lysimachus,” but this appears to have been a gloss.
