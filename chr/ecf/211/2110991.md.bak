#### <span id="iv.vi.iv.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.

<span id="iv.vi.iv.iv-p1"></span>The answer on the humility shown by our
request.

<span id="iv.vi.iv.iv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.iv-p2.1"></span>Pinufius</span>: I am indeed delighted at
the very plentiful fruits of your humility, which indeed I saw with no
indifferent concern, when I was formerly received in the habitation of
that cell of yours, and I am very glad that you welcome with such
respect the charge given by us, the least of all Christians, and the
words that I have taken the liberty of saying so that if I am not
mistaken you carry them out as soon as ever they are spoken by us; and
though, as I remember, the importance of the words scarcely deserves the
efforts you bestow on them, yet you so conceal the merits of your
virtue, as if no breath ever reached you of those things which you are
daily practising. But because this fact is worthy of the highest praise;
viz., that you declare that those institutes of the saints are still
unknown to you as if you were still beginners we will, as briefly as
possible, summarize what you so eagerly ask of us. For we must even
beyond our powers and ability, obey the commands of such old friends as
you. And so on the value and appeasing power of penitence many have
published a great deal, not only in words but also in writing, showing
how useful it is, how strong, and full of grace, so that when God is
offended by our past sins, and on the point of inflicting a most just
punishment for such offences, it somehow, if it is not wrong to say so,
stops Him, and, if I may so say, stays the right hand of the Avenger
even against His will. But I have no doubt that all this is well known
to you, either from your natural wisdom, or from your unwearied study of
Holy Scripture, so that from this the first shoots, so to speak, of your
conversion sprang up. Finally, you are anxious not about the character
of penitence but about its end, and the marks of satisfaction, and so by
a very shrewd question ask what has been left out by others.
