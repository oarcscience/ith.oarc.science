#### <span id="iv.iii.xi.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.

<span id="iv.iii.xi.iv-p1"></span>How vainglory attacks a monk on the
right had and on the left.

<span id="iv.iii.xi.iv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.xi.iv-p2.1"></span>And</span> so one who wishes to go along
the King’s highway by means of the “arms of righteousness which are on
the right hand and on the left,” ought by the teaching of the Apostle to
pass through “honour and dishonour, evil report and good report,” <span
id="fr_1003"></span>[1004](#fn_1003) and with such care to direct his
virtuous course amid the swelling waves of temptation, with discretion
at the helm, and the Spirit of the Lord breathing on us, since we know
that if we deviate ever so little to the right hand or to the left, we
shall presently be dashed against most dangerous crags. And so we are
warned by Solomon, the wisest of men: “Turn not aside to the right hand
or to the left;” <span id="fr_1004"></span>[1005](#fn_1004) i.e., do not
flatter yourself on your virtues and be puffed up by your spiritual
achievements on the right hand; nor, swerving to the path of vices on
the left hand, seek from them for yourself (to use the words of the
Apostle) “glory in your shame.” <span
id="fr_1005"></span>[1006](#fn_1005) For where the devil cannot create
vainglory in a man by means of his well-fitting and neat dress, he tries
to introduce it by means of a dirty, cheap, and uncared-for style. If he
cannot drag a man down by honour, he overthrows him by humility. If he
cannot make him puffed up by the grace of knowledge and eloquence, he
pulls him down by the weight of silence. If a man fasts openly, he is
attacked by the pride of vanity. If he conceals it for the sake of
despising the glory of it, he is assailed by the same sin of pride. In
order that he may not be defiled by the stains of vainglory he avoids
making long prayers in the sight of the brethren; and yet because he
offers them secretly and has no one who is conscious of it, he does not
escape the pride of vanity.
