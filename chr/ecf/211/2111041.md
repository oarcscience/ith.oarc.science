<span id="iv.vi.vii.iii"></span>

#### <span id="iv.vi.vii.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.

<span id="iv.vi.vii.iii-p1"></span>What is really the good which the
Apostle testifies that he could not perform.

<span id="iv.vi.vii.iii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.vii.iii-p2.1"></span>What</span> then is that one thing which
is so incomparably above those great and innumerable good things, that,
while they are all scorned and rejected, it alone should be acquired?
Doubtless it is that truly good part, the grand and lasting character of
which is thus described by the Lord, when Mary disregarded the duties of
hospitality and courtesy and chose it: “Martha, Martha, thou art careful
and troubled about many things: but there is but need of but few things
or even of one only. Mary hath chosen the good part which shall not be
taken away from her.” <span id="fr_2234"></span>[2235](#fn_2234)
Contemplation then, i.e., meditation on God, is the one thing, the value
of which all the merits of our righteous acts, all our aims at virtue,
come short of. And all those things which we said existed in the Apostle
Paul, were not only good and useful, but even great and splendid. But
as, for example, the metal of alloy which is considered of some use and
worth, becomes worthless when silver is taken into account, and again
the value of silver disappears in comparison with gold, and gold itself
is disregarded when compared with precious stones, and yet a quantity of
precious stones however splendid are outdone by the brightness of a
single pearl, so all those merits of holiness, although they are not
merely good and useful for the present life, but also secure the gift of
eternity, yet if they are compared with the merit of Divine
contemplation, will be considered trifling and so to speak, fit to be
sold. And to support this illustration by the authority of Scripture,
does not Scripture declare of all things in general which were created
by God, and say: “And behold everything that God had made was very
good;” and again: “And things that <span id="page_521">p. 521</span>
<span id="iv.vi.vii.iii-Page_521"></span>God hath made are all good in
their season”? <span id="fr_2235"></span>[2236](#fn_2235) These things
then which in the present time are termed not simply and solely good,
but emphatically “very good” (for they are really convenient for us
while living in this world, either for purposes of life, or for remedies
for the body, or by reason of some unknown usefulness, or else they are
indeed “very good,” because they enable us “to see the invisible things
of God from the creatures of the world, being understood by the things
that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead,” <span
id="fr_2236"></span>[2237](#fn_2236) from this great and orderly
arrangement of the fabric of the world; and to contemplate them from the
existence of everything in it), yet none of these things will keep the
name of good if they are regarded in the light of that world to come,
where no variation of good things, and no loss of true blessedness need
be feared. The bliss of which world is thus described: “The light of the
moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be
sevenfold as the light of seven days.” <span
id="fr_2237"></span>[2238](#fn_2237) These things then which are great
and wondrous to be gazed on, and marvellous, will at once appear as
vanity if they are compared with the future promises from faith; as
David says: “They all shall wax old as a garment, and as a vesture shalt
Thou change them, and they shall be changed. But Thou art the same, and
Thy years shall not fail.” <span id="fr_2238"></span>[2239](#fn_2238)
Because then there is nothing of itself enduring, nothing unchangeable,
nothing good but Deity alone, while every creature, to obtain the
blessing of eternity and immutability, aims at this not by its own
nature but by participation of its Creator, and His grace, they cannot
maintain their character for goodness when compared with their Creator.
