#### <span id="iv.iii.x.xxi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXI.

<span id="iv.iii.x.xxi-p1"></span>Different passages from the writings
of Solomon against accidie.

<span id="iv.iii.x.xxi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.x.xxi-p2.1"></span>And</span> Solomon, the wisest of men,
clearly points to this fault of idleness in many passages, as he says:
“He that followeth idleness shall be filled with poverty,” <span
id="fr_984"></span>[985](#fn_984) either visible or invisible, in which
an idle person and one entangled with different faults is sure to be
involved, and he will always be a stranger to the contemplation of God,
and to spiritual riches, of which the blessed Apostle says: “For in all
things ye were enriched in him, in all utterance and in all
knowledge.” <span id="fr_985"></span>[986](#fn_985) But concerning this
poverty of the idler elsewhere he also writes thus: “Every sluggard
shall be clothed in torn garments and rags.” <span
id="fr_986"></span>[987](#fn_986) For certainly he will not merit to be
adorned with that garment of incorruption (of which the Apostle says,
“Put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ,” <span
id="fr_987"></span>[988](#fn_987) and again: “Being clothed in the
breastplate of righteousness and charity,” <span
id="fr_988"></span>[989](#fn_988) concerning which the Lord Himself also
speaks to Jerusalem by the prophet: “Arise, arise, O Jerusalem, put on
the garments of thy glory),” <span id="fr_989"></span>[990](#fn_989)
whoever, overpowered by lazy slumber or by accidie, prefers to be
clothed, not by his labour and industry, but in the rags of idleness,
which he tears off from the solid piece and body of the Scriptures, and
fits on to his sloth no garment of glory and honour, but an ignominious
cloak and excuse. For those, who are affected by this laziness, and do
not like to support themselves by the labour of their own hands, as the
Apostle continually did and charged us to do, are wont to make use of
certain Scripture proofs by which they try to cloak their idleness,
saying that it is written, “Labour not for the meat that perisheth, but
for that which remains to life eternal;” <span
id="fr_990"></span>[991](#fn_990) and “My meat is to do the will of my
Father.” <span id="fr_991"></span>[992](#fn_991) But these proofs are
(as it were) rags, from the <span id="page_274">p. 274</span> <span
id="iv.iii.x.xxi-Page_274"></span>solid piece of the gospel, which are
adopted for this purpose, viz., to cover the disgrace of our idleness
and shame rather than to keep us warm, and adorn us with that costly and
splendid garment of virtue which that wise woman in the Proverbs, who
was clothed with strength and beauty, is said to have made either for
herself or for her husband; of which presently it is said: “Strength and
beauty are her clothing, and she rejoices in the latter days.” <span
id="fr_992"></span>[993](#fn_992) Of this evil of idleness Solomon thus
makes mention again: “The ways of the idlers are strewn with
thorns;” <span id="fr_993"></span>[994](#fn_993) i.e., with these and
similar faults, which the Apostle above declared to spring from
idleness. And again: “Every sluggard is always in want.” <span
id="fr_994"></span>[995](#fn_994) And of these the Apostle makes mention
when he says, “And that you want nothing of any man’s.” <span
id="fr_995"></span>[996](#fn_995) And finally: “For idleness has been
the teacher of many evils:” <span id="fr_996"></span>[997](#fn_996)
which the Apostle has clearly enumerated in the passage which he
expounded above: “Working not at all, but curiously meddling.” To this
fault also he joins another: “And that ye study to be quiet;” and then,
“that ye should do your own business and walk honestly towards them that
are without, and that you want nothing of any man’s.” Those also whom he
notes as disorderly and rebellious, from these he charges those who are
earnest to separate themselves: “That ye withdraw yourselves,” says he,
“from every brother that walketh disorderly and not according to the
tradition which they received from us.” <span
id="fr_997"></span>[998](#fn_997)
