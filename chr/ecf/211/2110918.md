#### <span id="iv.v.vii.xxvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXVII.

<span id="iv.v.vii.xxvii-p1"></span>How anger should be repressed.

<span id="iv.v.vii.xxvii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.vii.xxvii-p2.1"></span>We</span> ought then to restrain every
movement of anger and moderate it under the direction of discretion,
that we may not by blind rage be hurried into that which is condemned by
Solomon: “The wicked man expends all his anger, but the wise man
dispenses it bit by bit,” <span id="fr_2004"></span>[2005](#fn_2004.md)
i.e., a fool is inflamed by the passion of his anger to avenge himself;
but a wise man, by the ripeness of his counsel and moderation little by
little diminishes it, and gets rid of it. Something of the same kind too
is this which is said by the Apostle: “Not avenging yourselves, dearly
beloved: but give place to wrath,” <span
id="fr_2005"></span>[2006](#fn_2005.md) i.e., do not under the compulsion
of wrath proceed to vengeance, but give place to wrath, i.e., do not let
your hearts be confined in the straits of impatience and cowardice so
that, when a fierce storm of passion rises, you cannot endure it; but be
ye enlarged in your hearts, receiving the adverse waves of anger in the
wide gulf of that love which “suffereth all things, beareth all
things;” <span id="fr_2006"></span>[2007](#fn_2006.md) and so your mind
will be enlarged with wide long-suffering and patience, and will have
within it safe recesses of counsel, in which the foul smoke of anger
will be received and be diffused and forthwith vanish away; or else the
passage may be taken in this way: we give place to wrath, as often as we
yield with humble and tranquil mind to the passion of another, and bow
to the impatience of the passionate, as if we admitted that we deserved
any kind of wrong. But those who twist the meaning of the perfection of
which the Apostle speaks so as to make out that those give place to
anger, who go away from a man in a rage, seem to me not to cut off but
rather to foment the incitement to quarrelling, for unless a neighbour’s
wrath is overcome at once by amends being humbly made, a man provokes
rather than avoids it by his flight. And there is something like this
that Solomon says: “Be not hasty in thy spirit to be wroth, for anger
reposes in the bosom of fools;” and: “Be not quick to rush into a
quarrel, lest thou repent thereof at the last.” <span
id="fr_2007"></span>[2008](#fn_2007.md) For he does not blame a hasty
exhibition of quarrelling and anger in such a way as to praise a tardy
one. In the same way too must this be taken: “A fool declares his anger
in the very same hour, but a prudent man hides his shame.” <span
id="fr_2008"></span>[2009](#fn_2008.md) For he does not lay it down that a
shameful outburst of anger ought to be hidden by wise men in such a way
that while he blames a speedy outburst of anger he fails to forbid a
tardy one, as certainly, if owing to human weakness it does burst forth,
he means that it should be hidden for this reason, that while for the
moment it is wisely covered up, it may be destroyed forever. For the
nature of anger is such that when it is given room it languishes and
perishes, but if openly exhibited, it burns more and more. The hearts
then should be enlarged and opened wide, lest they be confined in the
narrow straits of cowardice, and be filled with the swelling surge of
wrath, and so we become unable to receive what the prophet calls the
“exceeding broad” commandment of God in our narrow heart, or to say with
the prophet: “I have run the way of thy commandments for thou hast
enlarged my heart.” <span id="fr_2009"></span>[2010](#fn_2009.md) For that
long-suffering is wisdom we are taught by very clear passages of
Scripture: for “a man who is long-suffering is great in prudence; but a
coward is very foolish.” <span id="fr_2010"></span>[2011](#fn_2010.md) And
therefore Scripture says of him who to his credit asked the gift of
wisdom from the Lord: “God gave Solomon wisdom and prudence <span
id="page_460">p. 460</span> <span
id="iv.v.vii.xxvii-Page_460"></span>exceeding much, and largeness of
heart as the sand of the sea for multitude.” <span
id="fr_2011"></span>[2012](#fn_2011.md)
