#### <span id="iv.iii.v.xxiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXIII.

<span id="iv.iii.v.xxiii-p1"></span>What should be the character of the
monk’s food.

<span id="iv.iii.v.xxiii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.v.xxiii-p2.1"></span>We</span> should then choose for our
food, not only that which moderates the heat of burning lust, and avoids
kindling it; but what is easily got ready, and what is recommended by
its cheapness, and is suitable to the life of the brethren and their
common use. For the nature of gluttony is threefold: first, there is
that which forces us to anticipate the proper hour for a meal, next that
which delights in stuffing the stomach, and gorging all kinds of food;
thirdly, that which takes pleasure in more refined and delicate
feasting. And so against it a monk should observe a threefold watch:
first, he should wait till the proper time for breaking the fast;
secondly, he should not give way to gorging; thirdly, he should be
contented with any of the commoner sorts of food. For anything that is
taken over and above what is customary and the common use of all, is
branded by the ancient tradition of the fathers as defiled with the sin
of vanity and glorying and ostentation. Nor of those whom we have seen
to be deservedly eminent for learning and discretion, or whom the grace
of Christ has singled out as shining lights for every one to imitate,
have we known any who have abstained from eating bread which is
accounted cheap and easily to be obtained among them; nor have we seen
that any one who has rejected this rule and given up the use of bread
and taken to a diet of beans or herbs or fruits, has been reckoned among
the most esteemed, or even acquired the grace of knowledge and
discretion. For not only do they lay it down that a monk ought not to
ask for foods which are not customary for others, lest his mode of life
should be exposed publicly to all and rendered vain and idle and so be
destroyed by the disease of vanity; but they insist that the common
chastening discipline of fasts ought not lightly to be disclosed to any
one, but as far as possible concealed and kept secret. But when any of
the brethren arrive they rule that we ought to show the virtues of
kindness and charity instead of observing a severe abstinence and our
strict daily rule: nor should we consider what our own wishes and profit
or the ardour of our desires may require, but set before us and gladly
fulfil whatever the refreshment of the guest, or his weakness may demand
from us.
