#### <span id="ii.vi.ii.x-p0.1"></span>Chapter X.

<span id="ii.vi.ii.x-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.vi.ii.x-p1.1"></span>Next</span>, Darius, under whom the temple
was restored, obtained the kingdom, his name being at that time Ochus.
He had three Hebrew of tried fidelity as his bodyguard, and of these
had, from the proof of his prudence which he had given, attracted
towards himself the admiration of the king. The choice, then, being
given him of asking for anything which he had formed a desire for in his
heart, groaning over the ruins of his country, he begged permission to
restore the city, and obtained an order from the king to urge the
lieutenants and rulers to hurry forward the building of the holy temple,
and furnish the expense needful to that end. Accordingly, the temple was
completed in four years; that is, in the sixth year after Darius began
to reign, and that seemed, for the time, enough to the people of the
Jews. For, as it was a work of great labor to restore the city,
distrusting their own resources, they did not venture at the time to
begin an undertaking of so great difficulty, but were content with
having rebuilt the temple. At the same time, Esdras the scribe, who was
skilled in the law, about twenty years after the temple had been
completed (Darius being now dead who had possessed the sovereignty for
nineteen years), by the permission of Artaxerxes the second (not he who
had a place between the two Xerxes, but he who had succeeded to Darius
Ochus), set out from Babylon with many following him, and they carried
to Jerusalem the vessels of various workmanship, as well as the gifts
which the king had sent for the temple of God. Along with them were but
twelve Levites; for with difficulty that number of the tribe is related
then to have been found. He, having found that the Jews united in
marriage with the Gentiles, rebuked them severely on that account, and
ordered them to renounce all connections of that kind, as well as to put
away the children which had been the issue of such marriages; and all
yielded obedience to his word. The people, then, being <span

id="ii.vi.ii.x-Page_102"></span>sanctified, performed the rites
sanctioned by the ancient law. But I do not find that Esdras did
anything with the view of restoring the city; because he thought, as I
imagine, that a more urgent duty was to reform the people from the
corrupt habits which they had contracted.
