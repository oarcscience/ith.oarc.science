<p class="subh"><a name="iv.v.viii.xxv-p1"></A>The evidence of Scripture on changes of determination.</p>  
<p class="skip"><a name="iv.v.viii.xxv-p2"></A><span class="sc"><a name="iv.v.viii.xxv-p2.1"></A>It</span> is impossible for us briefly to run through everything. For who could count up almost all the patriarchs and numberless saints, some of whom for the preservation of life, others out of desire for a blessing, others out of pity, others to conceal some secret, others out of zeal for God, others in searching for the  <A NAME="page_470"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 470</FONT></A> <a name="iv.v.viii.xxv-Page_470"></A>truth, became, so to speak, patrons of lying? And as all cannot be enumerated, so all ought not to be altogether passed over. For piety forced the blessed Joseph to raise a false charge against his brethren even with an oath by the life of the king, saying: &#8220;Ye are spies: to see the nakedness of the land are ye come;&#8221; and below: &#8220;send,&#8221; says he, &#8220;one of you, and bring your brothers hither: but ye shall be kept here until your words are made manifest whether ye speak the truth or no: but if not, by the life of Pharaoh, ye are spies.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2048"></A><A HREF="#fn_2048"><FONT SIZE="1">2049</FONT></A>
 For if he had not out of pity alarmed them by this lie, he would not have been able to see again his father and his brother, nor to preserve them in their great danger of starvation, nor to free the conscience of his brethren from the guilt of selling him. The act then of striking his brethren with fear by means of a lie was not so reprehensible as was it a holy and laudable act to urge his enemies and seekers to a salutary penitence by means of a feigned danger. Finally when they were weighed down by the odium of the very serious accusation, they were conscience-stricken not at the charge falsely raised against them, but at the thought of their earlier crime, and said to one another: &#8220;We suffer this rightly because we sinned against our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul when he asked us and we did not hearken to him: wherefore all this trouble hath come upon us.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2049"></A><A HREF="#fn_2049"><FONT SIZE="1">2050</FONT></A>
 And this confession, we think, expiated by most salutary humility their terrible sin not only against their brother, against whom they had sinned with wicked cruelty, but also against God. What about Solomon, who in his first judgment manifested the gift of wisdom, which he had received of God, only by making use of falsehood? For in order to get at the truth which was hidden by the woman&#146;s lie, even he used the help of a lie most cunningly invented, saying: &#8220;Bring me a sword and divide the living child into two parts, and give the one half to the one and the other half to the other.&#8221; And when this pretended cruelty stirred the heart of the true mother, but was received with approval by her who was not the true mother, then at last by this most sagacious discovery of the truth he pronounced the judgment which every one has felt to have been inspired by God, saying: &#8220;Give her the living child and slay it not: she is the mother of it.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2050"></A><A HREF="#fn_2050"><FONT SIZE="1">2051</FONT></A>
 Further we are more fully taught by other passages of Scripture as well that we neither can nor should carry out everything which we determine either with peace or disturbance of mind, as we often hear that holy men and angels and even Almighty God Himself have changed what they had decided upon. For the blessed David determined and confirmed it by an oath, saying: &#8220;May God do so and add more to the foes of David if I leave of all that belong unto Nabal until the morning a single male.&#8221; And presently when Abigail his wife interceded and intreated for him, he gave up his threats, lightened the sentence, and preferred to be regarded as a breaker of his word rather than to keep his pledged oath by cruelly executing it, saying: &#8220;As the Lord liveth, if thou hadst not quickly come to meet me there had not been left to Nabal by the morning light a single male.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2051"></A><A HREF="#fn_2051"><FONT SIZE="1">2052</FONT></A>
 And as we do not hold that his readiness to take a rash oath (which resulted from his anger and disturbance of mind) ought to be copied by us, so we do think that the pardon and revision of his determination is to be followed. The &#8220;chosen vessel,&#8221; in writing to the Corinthians, promises unconditionally to return, saying: &#8220;But I will come to you when I pass through Macedonia: for I will pass through Macedonia. But I will stay or even pass the winter with you that you may conduct me whithersoever I shall go. For I do not want only to see you in passing: for I hope to stay with you for some time.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2052"></A><A HREF="#fn_2052"><FONT SIZE="1">2053</FONT></A>
 And this fact he remembers in the Second Epistle, thus: &#8220;And in this confidence I was minded first to come unto you, that ye might receive a second favour, and by you to pass into Macedonia and again to come to you from Macedonia and by you be conducted to Jud&aelig;a.&#8221; But a better plan suggested itself and he plainly admits that he is not going to fulfil what he had promised. &#8220;When then,&#8221; says he, &#8220;I purposed this, did I use light-mindedness? or the things that I think, do I think after the flesh, that there should be with me yea, yea, and nay, nay?&#8221; Lastly, he declares even with the affirmation of an oath, why it was that he preferred to put on one side his pledged word rather than by his presence to bring a burden and grief to his disciples: &#8220;But I call God to witness against my soul that it was to spare you that I came not as far as Corinth. For I determined this with myself that I would not come unto you in sorrow.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2053"></A><A HREF="#fn_2053"><FONT SIZE="1">2054</FONT></A>
 Though when the angels had refused to enter the house of Lot at Sodom, saying to him: &#8220;We will not enter but will remain in the street,&#8221; they were presently forced by his prayers to change their determination, as Scripture subjoins: &#8220;And Lot constrained them, and they turned in to him.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2054"></A><A HREF="#fn_2054"><FONT SIZE="1">2055</FONT></A>
 And  <A NAME="page_471"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 471</FONT></A> <a name="iv.v.viii.xxv-Page_471"></A>certainly if they knew that they would turn in to him, they refused his request with a sham excuse: but if their excuse was a real one, then they are clearly shown to have changed their mind. And certainly we hold that the Holy Spirit inserted this in the sacred volume for no other reason but to teach us by their examples that we ought not to cling obstinately to our own determinations, but to subject them to our will, and so to keep our judgment free from all the chains of law that it may be ready to follow the call of good counsel in any direction, and may not delay or refuse to pass without any delay to whatever a sound discretion may find to be the better choice. And to rise to still higher instances, when king Hezekiah was lying on his bed and afflicted with grievous sickness the prophet Isaiah addressed him in the person of God, and said: &#8220;Thus saith the Lord: set thine house in order for thou shalt die and not live. And Hezekiah,&#8221; it says, &#8220;turned his face to the wall and prayed to the Lord and said: I beseech thee, O Lord, remember how I have walked before Thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and how I have done what was right in Thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.&#8221; After which it was again said to him: &#8220;Go, return, and speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying: Thus saith the Lord God of David thy father: I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: and behold, I will add to thy days fifteen years: and I will deliver thee out of the hand of the king of the Assyrians, and I will defend this city for thy sake and for my servant David&#146;s sake.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2055"></A><A HREF="#fn_2055"><FONT SIZE="1">2056</FONT></A>
 What can be clearer than this proof that out of consideration for mercy and goodness the Lord would rather break His word and instead of the pre-arranged limit of death extend the life of him who prayed, for fifteen years, rather than be found inexorable because of His unchangeable decree? In the same way too the Divine sentence says to the men of Nineveh: &#8220;Yet three days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown;&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2056"></A><A HREF="#fn_2056"><FONT SIZE="1">2057</FONT></A>
 and presently this stern and abrupt sentence is softened by their penitence and fasting, and is turned to the side of mercy with goodness that is easy to be intreated. But if any one maintains that the Lord had threatened the destruction of their city (while He foreknew that they would be converted) for this reason, that He might incite them to a salutary penitence, it follows that those who are set over their brethren may, if need arises, without any blame for telling lies, threaten those who need improvement with severer treatment than they are really going to inflict. But if one says that God revoked that severe sentence in consideration of their penitence, according to what he says by Ezekiel: &#8220;If I say to the wicked, Thou shalt surely die: and he becomes penitent for his sin, and doeth judgment and justice, he shall surely live, he shall not die;&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2057"></A><A HREF="#fn_2057"><FONT SIZE="1">2058</FONT></A>
 we are similarly taught that we ought not obstinately to stick to our determination, but that we should with gentle pity soften down the threats which necessity called forth. And that we may not fancy that the Lord granted this specially to the Ninevites, He continually affirms by Jeremiah that He will do the same in general towards all, and promises that without delay He will change His sentence in accordance with our deserts; saying: &#8220;I will suddenly speak against a nation and against a kingdom to root out and to pull down and to destroy it. If that nation repent of the evil, which I have spoken against it, I also will repent of the evil which I thought to do to them. And I will suddenly speak of a nation and a kingdom, to build up and to plant it. If it shall do evil in My sight, that it obey not My voice: I will repent of the good that I thought to do to it.&#8221; To Ezekiel also: &#8220;Leave out not a word, if so be they will hearken and be converted every one from his evil way: that I may repent Me of the evil that I thought to do to them for the wickedness of their doings.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2058"></A><A HREF="#fn_2058"><FONT SIZE="1">2059</FONT></A>
 And by these passages it is declared that we ought not obstinately to stick to our decisions, but to modify them with reason and judgment, and that better courses should always be adopted and preferred, and that we should turn without any delay to that course which is considered the more profitable. For this above all that invaluable sentence teaches us, because though each man&#146;s end is known beforehand to Him before his birth, yet somehow He so orders all things by a plan and method for all, and with regard to man&#146;s disposition, that He decides on everything not by the mere exercise of His power, nor according to the ineffable knowledge which His Prescience possesses, but according to the present actions of men, and rejects or draws to Himself each one, and daily either grants or withholds His grace. And that this is so the election of Saul also shows us, of whose miserable end the foreknowledge of God certainly could not be ignorant, and yet He chose him out of so many thousands of Israel and anointed him king, rewarding the then existing merits of his life, and not considering the sin of his coming fall, so that after he became  <A NAME="page_472"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 472</FONT></A> <a name="iv.v.viii.xxv-Page_472"></A>reprobate, God complains almost in human terms and, with man&#146;s feelings, as if He repented of his choice, saying: &#8220;It repenteth Me that I have appointed Saul king: for he hath forsaken Me, and hath not performed My words;&#8221; and again: &#8220;But Samuel was grieved for Saul because the Lord repented that He had made Saul king over Israel.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2059"></A><A HREF="#fn_2059"><FONT SIZE="1">2060</FONT></A>
 Finally this that He afterwards executed, that the Lord also declares by the prophet Ezekiel that He will by His daily judgment do with all men, saying: &#8220;Yea, if I shall say to the righteous that he shall surely live, and he trusting in his righteousness commit iniquity: all his righteousness shall be forgotten, and in his iniquity which he hath committed, in the same he shall die. And if I shall say to the wicked: Thou shalt surely die; and if he repent of his sin and do judgment and righteousness, and if that wicked man restore the pledge and render what he hath robbed, and walk in the commandments of life, and do no righteous thing, he shall surely live, he shall not die. None of his sins which he hath committed shall be imputed unto him.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2060"></A><A HREF="#fn_2060"><FONT SIZE="1">2061</FONT></A>
 Finally, when the Lord would for their speedy fall turn away His merciful countenance from the people, whom He had chosen out of all nations, the giver of the law interposes on their behalf and cries out: &#8220;I beseech Thee, O Lord, this people have sinned a great sin; they have made for themselves gods of gold; and now if Thou forgivest their sin, forgive it; but if not, blot me out of Thy book which Thou hast written. To whom the Lord answered: If any man hath sinned before Me, I will blot him out of My book.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2061"></A><A HREF="#fn_2061"><FONT SIZE="1">2062</FONT></A>
 David also, when complaining in prophetic spirit of Judas and the Lord&#146;s persecutors, says: &#8220;Let them be blotted out of the book of the living;&#8221; and because they did not deserve to come to saving penitence because of the guilt of their great sin, he subjoins: &#8220;And let them not be written among the righteous.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2062"></A><A HREF="#fn_2062"><FONT SIZE="1">2063</FONT></A>
 Finally in the case of Judas himself the meaning of the prophetic curse was clearly fulfilled, for when his deadly sin was completed, he killed himself by hanging, that he might not after his name was blotted out be converted and repent and deserve to be once more written among the righteous in heaven. We must therefore not doubt that at the time when he was chosen by Christ and obtained a place in the Apostolate, the name of Judas was written in the book of the living, and that he heard as well as the rest the words: &#8220;Rejoice not because the devils are subject unto you, but rejoice because your names are written in heaven.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2063"></A><A HREF="#fn_2063"><FONT SIZE="1">2064</FONT></A>
 But because he was corrupted by the plague of covetousness and had his name struck out from that heavenly list, it is suitably said of him and of men like him by the prophet: &#8220;O Lord, let all those that forsake Thee be confounded. Let them that depart from Thee be written in the earth, because they have forsaken the Lord, the vein of living waters.&#8221; And elsewhere: &#8220;They shall not be in the counsel of My people, nor shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel, neither shall they enter into the land of Israel.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2064"></A><A HREF="#fn_2064"><FONT SIZE="1">2065</FONT></A>
