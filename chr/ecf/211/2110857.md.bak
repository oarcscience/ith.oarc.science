#### <span id="iv.v.iv.xvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVI.

<span id="iv.v.iv.xvi-p1"></span>Of the grace of God; to the effect that
it transcends the narrow limits of human faith.

<span id="iv.v.iv.xvi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.iv.xvi-p2.1"></span>But</span> let no one imagine that we have
brought forward these instances to try to make out that the chief share
in our salvation rests with our faith, according to the profane notion
of some who attribute everything to free will and lay down that the
grace of God is dispensed in accordance with the desert of each man: but
we plainly assert our unconditional opinion that the grace of God is
superabounding, and sometimes overflows the narrow limits of man’s lack
of faith. And this, as we remember, happened in the case of the ruler in
the gospel, who, as he believed that it was an easier thing for his son
to be cured when sick than to be raised when dead, implored the Lord to
come at once, saying: “Lord, come down ere my child die;” and though
Christ reproved his lack of faith with these words: “Except ye see signs
and wonders ye will not believe,” yet He did not manifest the grace of
His Divinity in proportion to the weakness of his faith, nor did He
expell the deadly disease of the fever by His bodily presence, as the
man believed he would, but by the word of His power, saying: “Go thy
way, thy son liveth.” <span id="fr_1855"></span>[1856](#fn_1855.md) And we
read also that the Lord poured forth this superabundance of grace in the
case of the cure of the paralytic, when, though he only asked for the
healing of the weakness by which his body was enervated, He first
brought health to the soul by saying: “Son, be of good cheer, thy sins
be forgiven thee.” After which, when the scribes did not believe that He
could forgive men’s sins, in order to confound their incredulity, He set
free by the power of His word the man’s limb, and put an end to his
disease of paralysis, by saying: “Why think ye evil in your hearts?
Whether is easier to say, thy sins be forgiven thee, or to say, arise
and walk? But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth
to forgive sins, then saith He to the sick of the palsy: Arise, take up
thy bed, and go unto thine house.” <span
id="fr_1856"></span>[1857](#fn_1856.md) And in the same way in the case of
the man who had been lying for thirty-eight years near the edge of the
pool, and hoping for a cure from the moving of the water, He showed the
princely character of His bounty unasked. For when in His wish to arouse
him for the saving remedy, He had said to him: “willest thou to be made
whole,” and when the man complained of his lack of human assistance and
said: “I have no man to put me into the pool when the water is
troubled,” the Lord in His pity granted pardon to his unbelief and
ignorance, and restored him to his former health, not in the way which
he expected, but in the way which He Himself willed, saying: “Arise,
take up thy bed and go unto thine house.” <span
id="fr_1857"></span>[1858](#fn_1857.md) And what wonder if these acts are
told of the Lord’s power, when Divine grace has actually wrought similar
works by means of His servants! For when Peter and John were entering
the temple, when the man who was lame from his mother’s womb and had no
idea how to walk, asked an alms, they gave him not the miserable coppers
which the sick man asked for, but the power to walk, and when he was
only expecting the smallest of gifts to console him, enriched him with
the prize of unlooked for health, as Peter said: “Silver and gold have I
none: but such as I have, give I unto thee. In the name of Jesus Christ
of Nazareth, rise up and walk.” <span
