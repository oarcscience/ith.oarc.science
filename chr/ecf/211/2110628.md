<span id="iv.iv.iv.x"></span>

#### <span id="iv.iv.iv.x-p0.1"></span>Chapter X.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.x-p1"></span>That none can become perfect merely
through the first grade of renunciation.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.x-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.iv.x-p2.1"></span>In</span> leaving then these visible goods
of the world we forsake not our own wealth, but that which is not ours,
although we boast of it as either gained by our own exertions or
inherited by us from our forefathers. For as I said nothing is our own,
save this only which we possess with our heart, and which cleaves to our
soul, and therefore cannot be taken away from us by any one. But Christ
speaks in terms of censure of those visible riches, to those who clutch
them as if they were their own, and refuse to share them with those in
want. “If ye have not been faithful in what is another’s, who will give
to you what is your own?” <span id="fr_1239"></span>[1240](#fn_1239.md)
Plainly then it is not only daily <span id="page_325">p. 325</span>
<span id="iv.iv.iv.x-Page_325"></span>experience which teaches us that
these riches are not our own, but this saying of our Lord also, by the
very title which it gives them. But concerning visible <span
id="fr_1240"></span>[1241](#fn_1240.md) and worthless riches Peter says to
the Lord: “Lo, we have left all and followed thee. What shall we have
therefore?” <span id="fr_1241"></span>[1242](#fn_1241.md) when it is clear
that they had left nothing but their miserable broken nets. And unless
this expression “all” is understood to refer to that renunciation of
sins which is really great and important, we shall not find that the
Apostles had left anything of any value, or that the Lord had any reason
for bestowing on them the blessing of so great glory, that they were
allowed to hear from Him that “in the regeneration, when the Son of Man
shall sit on the throne of His glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve
thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.” <span
id="fr_1242"></span>[1243](#fn_1242.md) If then those, who have completely
renounced their earthly and visible goods, cannot for sufficient reason
attain to Apostolic charity, nor climb with readiness and vigour to that
third stage of renunciation which is still higher and belongs to but
few, what should those think of themselves, who do not even make that
first step (which is very easy) a thorough one, but keep together with
their old want of faith, their former sordid riches, and fancy that they
can boast of the mere name of monks? The first renunciation then of
which we spoke is of what is not our own, and therefore is not enough of
itself to confer perfection on the renunciant, unless he advances to the
second, which is really and truly a renunciation of what belongs to us.
And when we have made sure of this by the expulsion of all our faults,
we shall mount to the heights of the third renunciation also, whereby we
rise above not merely all those things which are done in this world or
specially belong to men, but even that whole universe around us which is
esteemed so glorious, and shall with heart and soul look down upon it as
subject to vanity and destined soon to pass away; as we look, as the
Apostle says, “not on those things which are seen, but on those which
are not seen: for the things that are seen, are temporal, and the things
which are not seen are eternal;” <span
id="fr_1243"></span>[1244](#fn_1243.md) that so we may be found worthy to
hear that highest utterance, which was spoken to Abraham: “and come into
a land which I will show thee,” <span
id="fr_1244"></span>[1245](#fn_1244.md) which clearly shows that unless a
man has made those three former renunciations with all earnestness of
mind, he cannot attain to this fourth, which is granted as a reward and
privilege to one whose renunciation is perfect, that he may be found
worthy to enter the land of promise which no longer bears for him the
thorns and thistles of sins; which after all the passions have been
driven out is acquired by purity of heart even in the body, and which no
good deeds or exertions of man’s efforts (can gain), but which the Lord
Himself promises to show, saying “And come into the land which I will
show to thee:” which clearly proves that the beginning of our salvation
results from the call of the Lord, Who says “Get thee out from thy
country,” and that the completion of perfection and purity is His gift
in the same way, as He says “And come into the land which I will show
thee,” i.e., not one you yourself can know or discover by your own
efforts, but one which I will show not only to one who is ignorant of
it, but even to one who is not looking for it. And from this we clearly
gather that as we hasten to the way of salvation through being stirred
up by the inspiration of the Lord, so too it is under the guidance of
His direction and illumination that we attain to the perfection of the
highest bliss.
