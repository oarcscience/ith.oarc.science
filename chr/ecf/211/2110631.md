#### <span id="iv.iv.iv.xiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIII.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xiii-p1"></span>That the ordering of our way comes
from God.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xiii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.iv.xiii-p2.1"></span>And</span> truly the saints have never
said that it was by their own efforts that they secured the direction of
the way in which they walked in their course towards advance and
perfection of virtue, but rather they prayed for it from the Lord,
saying “Direct me in Thy truth,” and “direct my way in thy sight.” <span
id="fr_1252"></span>[1253](#fn_1252) But someone else declares that he
discovered this very fact not only by faith, but also by experience, and
as it were from the very nature of things: “I know, O Lord, that the way
of man is not his: neither is it in a man to walk and to direct his
steps.” <span id="fr_1253"></span>[1254](#fn_1253) And the Lord Himself
says to Israel: “I will direct him like a green fir-tree: from Me is thy
fruit found.” <span id="fr_1254"></span>[1255](#fn_1254)
