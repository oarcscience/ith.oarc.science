#### <span id="iv.vi.iv.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.

<span id="iv.vi.iv.ix-p1"></span>How valuable to the perfect is the
forgetfulness of sin.

<span id="iv.vi.iv.ix-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.ix-p2.1"></span>But</span> with regard to this that you
said a little way back; viz., that you of set purpose go over the
recollections of past sins, this ought certainly not to be done, nay, if
it forcibly surprises you, it must be at once expelled. For it greatly
hinders the soul from the contemplation of purity, and especially in the
case of one who is living in solitude, as it entangles him in the stains
of this world and swamps him in foul sins. For while you are recalling
those things which you did through ignorance or wantonness in accordance
with the prince of this world, though I grant you that while you are
engaged in these thoughts no delight in them steals in, yet at least the
mere taint of the ancient filthiness is sure to corrupt your soul with
its foul stink, and to shut out the spiritual fragrance of goodness,
i.e., the odour of a sweet savour. When then the recollection of past
sins comes over your mind, you must recoil from it just as an honest and
upright man runs away if he is sought out in public by an immodest and
wanton woman either by words or by embraces. And certainly unless he at
once withdraws himself from contact with her, and if he allows himself
to linger the very least in impure talk, even if he refuses his consent
to the shameful pleasures, yet he cannot avoid the brand of infamy and
scorn in the judgment of all the passers by. So then we also, if by
noxious recollections we are led to thoughts of this kind, ought at once
to desist from dwelling upon them and to fulfil what we are commanded by
Solomon: “But go forth,” says he, “do not linger in her place, nor fix
thine eye on her;” <span id="fr_2147"></span>[2148](#fn_2147) lest if
the angels see us taken up with unclean and foul thoughts, they may not
be able to say to us in passing by: “The blessing of the Lord be upon
you.” <span id="fr_2148"></span>[2149](#fn_2148) For it is impossible
for the soul to continue in good thoughts, when the main part of the
heart is taken up with foul and earthly considerations. For this saying
of Solomon’s is true: “When thine eyes look on a strange woman, then
shall thy mouth speak wickedly, and thou shalt lie as it were in the
midst of the sea, and as a pilot in a great storm. But thou shalt say:
They have beaten me, but I felt no pain; and they mocked me, but I felt
not.” <span id="fr_2149"></span>[2150](#fn_2149) So then we should
forsake not only all foul but even all earthly thoughts and ever raise
the desires of our soul to heavenly things, in accordance with this
saying of our Saviour: “For where I am,” He says, “there also shall My
servant be.” <span id="fr_2150"></span>[2151](#fn_2150) For it often
happens that when anyone out of pity is in thought going over his own
falls or those of other faulty persons, he is affected by the delight
and assent to this most subtle attack, and that which was undertaken and
started with a show of goodness ends with a filthy and damaging
termination, for “there are ways which appear to men to be right, but
the ends thereof will come to the depths of hell.” <span
id="fr_2151"></span>[2152](#fn_2151)
