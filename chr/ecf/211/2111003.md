#### <span id="iv.vi.v.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.

<span id="iv.vi.v.iii-p1"></span>Of the offering of tithes and
firstfruits.

<span id="iv.vi.v.iii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.v.iii-p2.1"></span>For</span> indeed by the Lord’s command
tithes were consecrated to the service of the Levites, but oblations and
firstfruits for the priests. <span id="fr_2162"></span>[2163](#fn_2162)
But this was the law of the firstfruits; viz., <span id="page_504">p.
504</span> <span id="iv.vi.v.iii-Page_504"></span>that the fiftieth part
of fruits or animals should be given for the service of the temple and
the priests: and this proportion some who were faithlessly indifferent
diminished, while those who were very religious increased it, so that
the one gave only the sixtieth part, and the other gave the fortieth
part of their fruits. For the righteous, for whom the law is not
enacted, are thus shown to be not under the law, as they try not only to
fulfil but even to exceed the righteousness of the law, and their
devotion is greater than the legal requirement, as it goes beyond the
observance of precepts and adds to what is due of its own free will.
