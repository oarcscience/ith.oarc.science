#### <span id="iv.iii.xi.xi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XI.

<span id="iv.iii.xi.xi-p1"></span>The instance of King Uzziah who was
overcome by the taint of the same malady.

<span id="iv.iii.xi.xi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.xi.xi-p2.1"></span>Of</span> Uzziah, the ancestor of this
king of whom we have been speaking, himself also praised in all things
by the witness of the <span id="page_278">p. 278</span> <span
id="iv.iii.xi.xi-Page_278"></span>Scripture, after great commendation
for his virtue, after countless triumphs which he achieved by the merit
of his devotion and faith, learn how he was cast down by the pride of
vainglory. “And,” we are told, “the name of Uzziah went forth, for the
Lord helped him and had strengthened him. But when he was made strong,
his heart was lifted up to his destruction, and he neglected the Lord
his God.” <span id="fr_1010"></span>[1011](#fn_1010.md) You behold another
instance of a most terrible downfall, and see how two men so upright and
excellent were undone by their very triumphs and victories. Whence you
see how dangerous the successes of prosperity generally are, so that
those who could not be injured by adversity are ruined, unless they are
careful, by prosperity; and those who in the conflict of battle have
escaped the danger of death fall before their own trophies and triumphs.
