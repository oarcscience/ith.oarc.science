#### <span id="iv.iv.vii.xvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVII.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xvii-p1"></span>That no one is dashed to the ground
by a sudden fall.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xvii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.vii.xvii-p2.1"></span>But</span> we must not imagine that
anyone slips and comes to grief by a sudden fall, but that he falls by a
hopeless collapse either from being deceived by beginning his training
badly, or from the good qualities of his soul failing through a long
course of carelessness of mind, and so his faults gaining ground upon
him little by little. For “loss goeth before destruction, and an evil
thought before a fall,” <span id="fr_1432"></span>[1433](#fn_1432.md) just
as no house ever falls to the ground by a sudden collapse, but only when
there is some flaw of long standing in the foundation, or when by long
continued neglect of its inmates, what was at first only a little drip
finds its way through, and so the protecting walls are by degrees
ruined, and in consequence of long standing neglect the gap becomes
larger, and break away, and in time the drenching storm and rain pours
in like a river: for “by slothfulness a building is cast down, and
through the weakness of hands the house shall drop through.” <span
id="fr_1433"></span>[1434](#fn_1433.md) And that the same thing happens
spiritually to the soul the same Solomon thus tells us in other words,
when he says: “water dripping drives a man out of the house on a stormy
day.” <span id="fr_1434"></span>[1435](#fn_1434.md) Elegantly then does he
compare carelessness of mind to a roof, and to tiles that have not been
looked after, through which in the first instance only very slight
drippings (so to speak) of the passions make their way to the soul: but
if these are not heeded, as being but small and trifling, then the beams
of virtues will decay and be carried away by a great tempest of sins,
through which “on a stormy day,” i.e., in the time of temptation, the
devil’s attack will assail us, and the soul will be driven forth from
the abode of virtue, in which, as long as it preserved all watchful
diligence, it had remained as in a house that belonged to it.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xvii-p6"></span>And so when we had heard this, we
were so immensely delighted with our spiritual repast, that the mental
pleasure with which we were filled by this conference outweighed the
sorrow which we had experienced before from the death of the saints. For
not only were we instructed in things about which we had been puzzled,
but we also learnt from the raising of that question some things, which
our understanding had been too small for us to ask about.
