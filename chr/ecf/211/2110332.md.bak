#### <span id="iv.iii.iv.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.

<span id="iv.iii.iv.iii-p1"></span>Of the ordeal by which one who is to
be received in the monastery is tested.

<span id="iv.iii.iv.iii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.iv.iii-p2.1"></span>One</span>, then, who seeks to be
admitted to the discipline of the monastery is never received before he
gives, by lying outside the doors for ten days or even longer, an
evidence of his perseverance and desire, as well as of humility and
patience. And when, prostrate at the feet of all the brethren that pass
by, and of set purpose repelled and scorned by all of them, as if he was
wanting to enter the monastery not for the sake of religion but because
he was obliged; and when, too, covered with many insults and affronts,
he has given a practical proof of his steadfastness, and has shown what
he will be like in temptations by the way he has borne the disgrace; and
when, with the ardour of his soul thus ascertained, he is admitted, then
they enquire with the utmost care whether he is contaminated by a single
coin from his former possessions clinging to him. For they know that he
cannot stay for long under the discipline of the monastery, nor ever
learn the virtue of humility and obedience, nor be content with the
poverty and difficult life of the monastery, if he knows that ever so
small a sum of money has been kept hid; but, as soon as ever a
disturbance arises on some occasion or other, he will at once dart off
from the monastery like a stone from a sling, impelled to this by
trusting in that sum of money. <span id="fr_757"></span>[758](#fn_757.md)

<span id="iv.iii.iv.iii-p3"></span> Cf. the Rule of Pachomius, c. xxvi.:
“If any or comes to the door of the monastery wanting to renounce the
world and to join the number of the brethren, he shall not be allowed to
enter, but the Abbot of the monastery must first be told, and he shall
stay for a few days outside before the gate, and shall be taught the
Lord’s Prayer and as many Psalms as he can learn, and shall diligently
give proof of himself that he has not done any thing wrong and fled in
trouble for the time, and that he is not in any one’s power, and that he
can forsake his relations and disregard his property. And if they see
that he is apt for everything, then he shall be taught the rest of the
rules of the monastery,—what he ought to do, whom he is to obey,” etc.;
and, finally, he is to be admitted. See also the Rule of S. Benedict, c.
lviii., which is to much the same effect, and S. Basil’s *Longer
Monastic Rules*, Q. x.
