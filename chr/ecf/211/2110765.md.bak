<span id="iv.iv.ix.xxi"></span>

#### <span id="iv.iv.ix.xxi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXI.

<span id="iv.iv.ix.xxi-p1"></span>The answer to the question raised.

<span id="iv.iv.ix.xxi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.ix.xxi-p2.1"></span>Serenus</span>: You have propounded two
not unimportant questions, to which I will reply, to the best of my
ability, in the order in which you have raised them. We cannot possibly
believe that spiritual existences can have carnal intercourse with
women. But if this could ever have literally happened how is it that it
does not now also sometimes take place, and that we do not see some in
the same way born of women by the agency of demons without intercourse
with men? especially when it is clear that they delight in the pollution
of lust, which they would certainly prefer to bring about through their
own agency rather than through that of men, if they could possibly
manage it, as Ecclesiastes declares: “What is it that hath been? The
same that is. And what is it that hath been done? The same that is done.
And there is nothing new that can be said under the sun, so that a man
can say: Behold this is new; for it hath already been in the ages which
were before us.” <span id="fr_1550"></span>[1551](#fn_1550.md) But the
question raised may be resolved in this way. After the death of
righteous Abel, in order that the whole human race might not spring from
a wicked fratricide, Seth was born in the place of his brother who was
slain, to take the place of his brother not only as regards posterity,
but also as regards justice and goodness. And his offspring, following
the example of their father’s goodness, always remained separate from
intercourse with and the society of their kindred descended from the
wicked Cain, as the difference of the genealogy very clearly tells us,
where it says: “Adam begat Seth, Seth begat Enos, Enos begat Cainan, but
Cainan begat Mahalaleel, but Mahalaleel begat Jared, Jared begat Enoch,
Enoch begat Methuselah, Methuselah begat Lamech, Lamech begat
Noah.” <span id="fr_1551"></span>[1552](#fn_1551.md) And the genealogy of
Cain is given separately as follows: “Cain begat Enoch, Enoch begat
Cainan, Cainan begat Mahalaleel, Mahalaleel begat Methuselah, Methuselah
begat Lamech, Lamech begat Jabal and Jubal.” <span
id="fr_1552"></span>[1553](#fn_1552.md) And so the line which sprang from
the seed of righteous Seth always mixed with its own kith and kin, and
continued for a long while in the holiness of its fathers and ancestors,
untouched by the blasphemies and the wickedness of an evil offspring,
which had implanted in it a seed of sin as it were transmitted by its
ancestors. As long then as there continued that separation of the lines
between them, the seed of Seth, as it sprang from an excellent root, was
by reason of its sanctity termed “angels of God,” or as some copies have
it “sons of God;” <span id="fr_1553"></span>[1554](#fn_1553.md) and on the
contrary the others by reason of their own and their fathers’ wickedness
and their earthly deeds were termed “children of men.” Though then there
was up to this time that holy and salutary separation between them, yet
after this the sons of Seth who were the sons of God saw the daughters
of those who were born of the line of Cain, and inflamed with the desire
for their beauty took to themselves from them wives who taught their
husbands the wickedness of their fathers, and at once led them astray
from their innate holiness and the single-mindedness of their
forefathers. To whom this saying applies with sufficient accuracy: “I
have said: Ye are Gods, and ye are all the children of the Most High.
But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes;” <span
id="fr_1554"></span>[1555](#fn_1554.md) who fell away from that true study
of natural philosophy, handed down to them by their ancestors, which the
first man who forthwith traced out the study of all nature, could
clearly attain to, and transmit to his descendants on sure grounds,
inasmuch as he had seen the infancy of this world, while still as it
were tender and throbbing and unorganized; and as there was in him not
only such fulness of wisdom, but also the grace of prophecy given by the
Divine inspiration, so that while he was still an untaught inhabitant of
this world he gave names to all living creatures, and not only knew
about the fury and poison of all kinds of beasts and serpents, but also
distinguished between the virtues of plants and trees and the natures of
stones, and the changes of seasons of which he had as yet no experience,
so that he could well say: “The Lord <span id="page_384">p. 384</span>
<span id="iv.iv.ix.xxi-Page_384"></span>hath given me the true knowledge
of the things that are, to know the disposition of the whole world, and
the virtues of the elements, the beginning and the ending and the midst
of times, the alterations of their courses and the changes of their
seasons, the revolutions of the year and the disposition of the stars,
the natures of living creatures and the rage of wild beasts, the force
of winds, and the reasonings of men, the diversities of plants and the
virtues of roots, and all such things as are hid and open I have
learnt.” <span id="fr_1555"></span>[1556](#fn_1555.md) This knowledge then
of all nature the seed of Seth received through successive generations,
handed down from the fathers, so long as it remained separate from the
wicked line, and as it had received it in holiness, so it made use of it
to promote the glory of God and the needs of everyday life. But when it
had been mingled with the evil generation, it drew aside at the
suggestion of devils to profane and harmful uses what it had innocently
learnt, and audaciously taught by it the curious arts of wizards and
enchantments and magical superstitions, teaching its posterity to
forsake the holy worship of the Divinity and to honour and worship
either the elements or fire or the demons of the air. How it was then
that this knowledge of curious arts of which we have spoken, did not
perish in the deluge, but became known to the ages that followed,
should, I think, be briefly explained, as the occasion of this
discussion suggests, although the answer to the question raised scarcely
requires it. And so, as ancient traditions tell us, Ham the son of Noah,
who had been taught these superstitions and wicked and profane arts, as
he knew that he could not possibly bring any handbook on these subjects
into the ark, into which he was to enter with his good father and holy
brothers, inscribed these nefarious arts and profane devices on plates
of various metals which could not be destroyed by the flood of waters,
and on hard rocks, and when the flood was over he hunted for them with
the same inquisitiveness with which he had concealed them, and so
transmitted to his descendants a seed-bed of profanity and perpetual
sin. In this way then that common notion, according to which men believe
that angels delivered to men enchantments and diverse arts, is in truth
fulfilled. From these sons of Seth then and daughters of Cain, as we
have said, there were born still worse children who became mighty
hunters, violent and most fierce men who were termed giants by reason of
the size of their bodies and their cruelty and wickedness. For these
first began to harass their neighbours and to practise pillaging among
men, getting their living rather by rapine than by being contented with
the sweat and labour of toil, and their wickedness increased to such a
pitch that the world could only be purified by the flood and deluge. So
then when the sons of Seth at the instigation of their lust had
transgressed that command which had been for a long while kept by a
natural instinct from the beginning of the world, it was needful that it
should afterwards be restored by the letter of the law: “Thou shalt not
give thy daughter to his son to wife, nor shalt thou take a wife of his
daughters to thy son; for they shall seduce your hearts to depart from
your God, and to follow their gods and serve them.” <span

The interpretation of the passage which Cassian here rejects is adopted
by Philo and Josephus, the book of Enoch, and several of the early
fathers, including Justin Martyr, Tertullian, Clement of Alexandria,
Lactantius and others. The explanation, which Cassian here gives, taking
the “sons of God” of the Sethites, and the “daughters of men” of the
line of Cain, is apparently first found in Julius Africanus (<span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.iv.ix.xxi-p6.6"></span>οἰ ἀπό τοῦ Σὴθ
δίκαιοι</span>), and is adopted among others by Augustine, De Civitate
Dei, Book XV. xxiii., where the passage is fully discussed.
