#### <span id="iv.iv.v.xviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.

<span id="iv.iv.v.xviii-p1"></span>The question what is the difference
between the carnal and natural man.

<span id="iv.iv.v.xviii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.v.xviii-p2.1"></span>Germanus</span>: You have, it seems to
us, very clearly shown the value of the struggle which is raised between
the flesh and spirit, so that we can believe that it can in a sort of
way be grasped by us; and therefore we want to have this also explained
to us in the same way; viz., what is the difference between the carnal
and the natural man, or how the natural man can be worse than the
carnal.
