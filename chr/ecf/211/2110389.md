#### <span id="iv.iii.v.xvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVI.

<span id="iv.iii.v.xvi-p1"></span>How, after the fashion of the Olympic
games, a monk should not attempt spiritual conflicts unless he has won
battles over the flesh.

<span id="iv.iii.v.xvi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.v.xvi-p2.1"></span>And</span> so when the desires of the
belly and of the palate have been by these considerations overcome, and
when we have been declared, as in the Olympic contests, neither slaves
of the flesh nor infamous through the brand of sin, we shall be adjudged
to be worthy of the contest in higher struggles as well, and, leaving
behind lessons of this kind, may be believed capable of entering the
lists against spiritual wickednesses, against which only victors and
those who are allowed to contend in a spiritual conflict are deemed
worthy to struggle. For this is so to speak a most solid foundation of
all the conflicts, viz.: that in the first instance the impulses of
carnal desires should be destroyed. For no one can lawfully strive
unless his own flesh has been overcome. And one who does not strive
lawfully certainly cannot take a share in the contest, nor win a crown
of glory and the grace of victory. But if we have been overcome in this
battle, having been proved as it were slaves of carnal lusts, and thus
displaying the tokens neither of freedom nor of strength, we shall be
straightway repulsed from the conflicts with spiritual hosts, as
unworthy and as slaves, with every mark of confusion. For “every one
that doeth sin is the servant of sin.” <span
id="fr_839"></span>[840](#fn_839) And this will be addressed to us by
the blessed Apostle, together with those among whom fornication is
named. “Temptation does not overtake you, except such as is
human.” <span id="fr_840"></span>[841](#fn_840) For if we do not seek
for strength of mind <span id="fr_841"></span>[842](#fn_841) we shall
not deserve to make trial of severer contest against wickedness on high,
if we have been unable to subdue our weak flesh which resists the
spirit. And some not understanding this testimony of the Apostle, have
read the subjunctive instead of the indicative mood, i.e., “Let no
temptation overcome you, except such as is human.” <span
id="fr_842"></span>[843](#fn_842) But it is clear that it is rather said
by him with the meaning not of a wish but of a declaration or rebuke.
