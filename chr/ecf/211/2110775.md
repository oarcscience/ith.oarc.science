#### <span id="iv.iv.x.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.

<span id="iv.iv.x.v-p1"></span>Of the ways in which our soul is weighed
down.

<span id="iv.iv.x.v-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.x.v-p2.1"></span>But</span> we should notice the ways in which
the Lord points out that the soul is weighed down: for He did not
mention adultery, or fornication, or murder, or blasphemy, or rapine,
which everybody knows to be deadly and <span id="page_389">p. 389</span>
<span id="iv.iv.x.v-Page_389"></span>damnable, but surfeiting and
drunkenness, and the cares or anxieties of this world: which men of this
world are so far from avoiding or considering damnable that actually
some who (I am ashamed to say) call themselves monks entangle themselves
in these very occupations as if they were harmless or useful. And though
these three things, when literally given way to weigh down the soul, and
separate it from God, and bear it down to things earthly, yet it is very
easy to avoid them, especially for us who are separated by so great a
distance from all converse with this world, and who do not on any
occasion have anything to do with those visible cares and drunkenness
and surfeiting. But there is another surfeiting which is no less
dangerous, and a spiritual drunkenness which it is harder to avoid, and
a care and anxiety of this world, which often ensnares us even after the
perfect renunciation of all our goods, and abstinence from wine and all
feastings and even when we are living in solitude—and of such the
prophet says: “Awake, ye that are drunk but not with wine;” <span
id="fr_1587"></span>[1588](#fn_1587) and another: “Be astonished and
wonder and stagger: be drunk and not with wine: be moved, but not with
drunkenness.” <span id="fr_1588"></span>[1589](#fn_1588) And of this
drunkenness the wine must consequently be what the prophet calls “the
fury of dragons”: and from what root the wine comes you may hear: “From
the vineyard of Sodom,” he says, “is their vine, and their branches from
Gomorrha.” Would you also know about the fruit of that vine and the seed
of that branch? “Their grape is a grape of gall, theirs is a cluster of
bitterness” <span id="fr_1589"></span>[1590](#fn_1589) for unless we are
altogether cleansed from all faults and abstaining from the surfeit of
all passions, our heart will without drunkenness from wine and excess of
any feasting be weighed down by a drunkenness and surfeiting that is
still more dangerous. For that worldly cares can sometimes fall on us
who mix with no actions of this world, is clearly shown according to the
rule of the Elders, who have laid down that anything which goes beyond
the necessities of daily food, and the unavoidable needs of the flesh,
belongs to worldly cares and anxieties, as for example if, when a job
bringing in a penny would satisfy the needs of our body, we try to
extend it by a longer toil and work in order to get twopence or
threepence; and when a covering of two tunics would be enough for our
use both by night and day, we manage to become the owners of three or
four, or when a hut containing one or two cells would be sufficient, in
the pride of worldly ambition and greatness we build four or five cells,
and these splendidly decorated, and larger than our needs required, thus
showing the passion of worldly lusts whenever we can.
