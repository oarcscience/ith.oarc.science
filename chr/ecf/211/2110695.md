#### <span id="iv.iv.vii.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.iv-p1"></span>How evil cannot be forced on any one
by another against his will.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.iv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.vii.iv-p2.1"></span>Preserving</span> then these distinctions
clear and fixed, and knowing that there is nothing good except virtue
alone, and nothing bad except sin alone and separation from God, let us
now carefully consider whether God ever allows evil to be forced on his
saints either by Himself or by some one else. And you will certainly
find that this never happens. For another can never possibly force the
evil of sin upon anyone, who does not consent and who resists, but only
on one who admits it into himself through sloth and the corrupt desire
of his heart. Finally, when the devil having exhausted all his wicked
devices had tried to force upon the blessed Job this evil of sin, and
had not only stripped him of all his worldly goods, but also after that
terrible and <span id="page_354">p. 354</span> <span
id="iv.iv.vii.iv-Page_354"></span>utterly unlooked for calamity of
bereavement through the death of his seven children, had heaped upon him
dreadful wounds and intolerable tortures from the crown of his head to
the sole of his foot, he tried in vain to fasten on him the stain of
sin, because he remained steadfast through it all, never brought himself
to consent to blasphemy.
