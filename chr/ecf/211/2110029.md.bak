#### <span id="ii.ii.xxvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXV.

<span id="ii.ii.xxvi-p1"></span>Intercourse of Sulpitius with Martin.

<span id="ii.ii.xxvi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.ii.xxvi-p2.1"></span>For</span> since I, having long heard
accounts of his faith, life and virtues, burned with a desire of knowing
him, I undertook what was to me a pleasant journey for the purpose of
seeing him. At the same time, because already my mind was inflamed with
the desire of writing his life, I obtained my information partly from
himself, in so far as I could venture to question him, and partly from
those who had lived with him, or well knew the facts of the case. And at
this time it is scarcely credible with what humility and with what
kindness he received me; while he cordially wished me joy, and rejoiced
in the Lord that he had been held in such high estimation by me that I
had undertaken a journey owing to my desire of seeing him. Unworthy me!
(in fact, I hardly dare acknowledge it), that he should have deigned to
admit me to fellowship with him! He went so far as in person to present
me with water to wash my hands, and at eventide he himself washed my
feet; nor had I sufficient courage to resist or oppose his doing so. In
fact, I felt so overcome by the authority he unconsciously exerted, that
I deemed it unlawful to do anything but acquiesce in his arrangements.
His conversation with me was all directed to such points as the
following: that the allurements of this world and secular burdens were
to be abandoned in order that we might be free and unencumbered in
following the Lord Jesus; and he pressed upon me as an admirable example
in present circumstances the conduct of that distinguished man Paulinus,
of whom I have made mention above. Martin declared of him that, by
parting with his great possessions and following Christ, as he did, he
showed himself almost the only one who in these times had fully obeyed
the precepts of the Gospel. He insisted strongly that that was the man
who should be made the object of our imitation, adding that the present
age was fortunate in possessing such a model of faith and virtue. For
Paulinus, being rich and having many possessions, by selling them all
and giving them to the poor according to the expressed will of the Lord,
had, he said, made possible by actual proof what appeared impossible of
accomplishment. What power and dignity there were in Martin’s words and
conversation! How active he was, how practical, and how prompt and ready
in solving questions connected with Scripture! And because I know that
many are incredulous on this point,—for indeed I have met with persons
who did not believe me when I related such things,—I call to witness
Jesus, and our common hope as Christians, that I never heard from any
other lips than those of Martin such exhibitions of knowledge and
genius, or such specimens of good and pure speech. But yet, how
insignificant is all such praise when compared with the virtues which he
possessed! Still, it is remarkable that in a man who had no claim to be
called learned, even this attribute \[of high intelligence\] was not
wanting.
