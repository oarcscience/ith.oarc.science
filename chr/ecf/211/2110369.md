#### <span id="iv.iii.iv.xl-p0.1"></span>Chapter XL.

<span id="iv.iii.iv.xl-p1"></span>That the monk should seek for examples
of perfection not from many instances but from one or a very few.

<span id="iv.iii.iv.xl-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.iv.xl-p2.1"></span>And</span> that you may the more easily
arrive at this, the examples of the perfect life of one dwelling in the
congregation, which you may imitate, should be sought from a very few or
indeed from one or two only and not from too many. For apart from the
fact that a life which is tested and refined and purified is only to be
found in a few, there is this also to be gained, viz.: that a man is
more thoroughly instructed and formed by the example of some *one*,
towards the perfection which he sets before him, viz.: that of the
Cœnobite life.
