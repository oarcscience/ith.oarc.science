#### <span id="iv.vii.v.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.

<span id="iv.vii.v.iv-p1"></span>He brings forward other testimonies to
the same view.

<span id="iv.vii.v.iv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.v.iv-p2.1"></span>If</span> you would know how admirably the
Apostle preached this, hear how this utterance was put into his mouth;
as if from the mouth of God Himself, as the Lord says: “For God sent not
His Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world might be
saved through Him.” <span id="fr_2451"></span>[2452](#fn_2451) For lo,
as you see, the Lord Himself affirms that He was sent by God the Father
to save mankind. But if you think that it ought to be shown still more
clearly, what Son God sent to save men,—though God’s own and only
begotten can only be one, and when God is said to have sent His Son, He
is certainly shown to have sent His only begotten Son,—yet hear the
prophet David pointing out with the utmost clearness Him who was sent
for the salvation of Men. “He sent,” said he, “His Word and healed
them.” <span id="fr_2452"></span>[2453](#fn_2452) Can you twist this so
as to refer it to the flesh as if you could say that a mere man was sent
by God to heal mankind? You certainly cannot, for the prophet David and
all the holy Scriptures would cry out against you, saying, “He sent His
Word and healed them.” You see then, that the Word was sent to heal men,
for though healing was given through Christ, yet the Word of God was in
Christ, and healed all things through Christ: and so since Christ and
the Word were united in the mystery of the Incarnation, Christ and the
Word of God became one Son of God in either substance. And when the
Apostle John was anxious to state this clearly, he said “God sent His
Son to be the Saviour of the world.” <span
id="fr_2453"></span>[2454](#fn_2453) Do you see how he joined together
God and man in an union that cannot be severed? For Christ who was born
of Mary is without the slightest doubt called Saviour, as it is said,
“For to you is born this day a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.” <span
id="fr_2454"></span>[2455](#fn_2454) But here he calls the very Word of
God, which was sent, a Saviour, saying: “God sent his Son to be the
Saviour of the world.”
