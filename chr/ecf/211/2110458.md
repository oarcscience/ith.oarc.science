#### <span id="iv.iii.viii.x-p0.1"></span>Chapter X.

<span id="iv.iii.viii.x-p1"></span>Of the sun, of which it is said that
it should not go down upon your wrath.

<span id="iv.iii.viii.x-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.viii.x-p2.1"></span>And</span> of this sun God clearly makes
mention by the prophet, when He says, “But to those that fear my name
the sun of righteousness shall arise with healing in His wings.” <span
id="fr_934"></span>[935](#fn_934.md) And this again is said to “go down” at
midday on sinners and false prophets, and those who are angry, when the
prophet says, “Their sun is gone down at noon.” <span
id="fr_935"></span>[936](#fn_935.md) And at any rate “tropically” <span
id="fr_936"></span>[937](#fn_936.md) the mind, that is the <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.iii.viii.x-p5.1"></span>νοῦς</span> or
reason, which is fairly called the sun because it looks over all the
thoughts and discernings of the heart, should not be put out by the sin
of anger: lest when it “goes down” the shadows of disturbance, together
with the devil their author, fill all the feelings of our hearts, and,
overwhelmed by the shadows of wrath, as in a murky night, we know not
what we ought to do. In this sense it is that we have brought forward
this passage of the Apostle, handed down to us by the teaching of the
elders, because it was needful, even at the risk of a somewhat lengthy
discourse, to show how they felt with regard to anger, for they do not
permit it even for a moment to effect an entrance into our heart:
observing with the utmost care that saying of the gospel: “Whosoever is
angry with his brother is in danger of the judgment.” <span
id="fr_937"></span>[938](#fn_937.md) But if it be lawful to be angry up
till sunset, the surfeit of our wrath and the vengeance of our anger
will be able to give full play to passion and dangerous excitement
before that sun inclines towards its setting. <span

<span id="iv.iii.viii.x-p7"></span> Petschenig’s text is as follows:
*Ceterum si usque ad occasum solis licitur sit irasci, ante furoris
satietas et ultrices iræ—commotionem poterunt noxiæ perturbationis
explere, quam sol iste ad locum sui vergat occasus*. That of Gazæus has
“*ante perturbationes noxiæ poterunt furoris satietatem et ultricis iræ
commotionem explere, etc*.”
