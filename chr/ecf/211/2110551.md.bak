#### <span id="iv.iii.xii.xx-p0.1"></span>Chapter XX.

<span id="iv.iii.xii.xx-p1"></span>Of one who for his blasphemy was
given over to a most unclean spirit.

<span id="iv.iii.xii.xx-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.xii.xx-p2.1"></span>I knew</span> one of the number of the
brethren, whom I heartily wish I had never known; since afterwards he
allowed himself to be saddled with the responsibilities of my
order: <span id="fr_1071"></span>[1072](#fn_1071.md) who confessed to a
most admirable elder that he was attacked by a terrible sin of the
flesh: for he was inflamed with an intolerable lust, with the unnatural
desire of suffering rather than of committing a shameful act: then the
other like a true spiritual physician, at once saw through the inward
cause and origin of this evil. And, sighing deeply, said: “Never would
the Lord have suffered you to be given over to so foul a spirit unless
you had blasphemed against Him.” And he, when this was discovered, at
once fell at his feet on the ground, and, struck with the utmost
astonishment, as if he saw the secrets of his heart laid bare by God,
confessed that he had blasphemed with evil thoughts against the Son of
God. Whence it is clear that one who is possessed by the spirit of
pride, or who has been guilty of blasphemy against God,—as one who
offers a wrong to Him from whom the gift of purity must be looked for—is
deprived of his uprightness and perfection, and does not deserve the
sanctifying grace of chastity.
