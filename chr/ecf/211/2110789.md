#### <span id="iv.iv.x.xix-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIX.

<span id="iv.iv.x.xix-p1"></span>Of the clause “Thy kingdom come.”

<span id="iv.iv.x.xix-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.x.xix-p2.1"></span>The</span> second petition of the pure
heart desires that the kingdom of its Father may come at once; viz.,
either that whereby Christ reigns day by day in the saints (which comes
to pass when the devil’s rule is cast out of our hearts by the
destruction of foul sins, and God begins to hold sway over us by the
sweet odour of virtues, and, fornication being overcome, charity reigns
in our hearts together with tranquillity, when rage is conquered; and
humility, when pride is trampled under foot) or else that which is
promised in due time to all who are perfect, and to all the sons of God,
when it will be said to them by Christ: “Come ye blessed of My Father,
inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the
world;” <span id="fr_1610"></span>[1611](#fn_1610) (as the heart.md) with
fixed and steadfast gaze, so to speak, yearns and longs for it and says
to Him “Thy kingdom come.” For it knows by the witness of its own
conscience that when He shall appear, it will presently share His lot.
For no guilty person would dare either to say or to wish for this, for
no one would want to face the tribunal of the Judge, who knew that at
His coming he would forthwith receive not the prize or reward of his
merits but only punishment.
