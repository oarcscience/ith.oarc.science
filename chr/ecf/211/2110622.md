#### <span id="iv.iv.iv.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.iv-p1"></span>An explanation of the three callings.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.iv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.iv.iv-p2.1"></span>To</span> make clear therefore the main
differences between these three kinds of calling, the first is from God,
the second comes through man, the third is from compulsion. And a
calling is from God whenever some inspiration has taken possession of
our heart, and even while we are asleep stirs in us at desire for
eternal life and salvation, and bids us follow God and cleave to His
commandments with life-giving contrition: as we read in Holy Scripture
that Abraham was called by the voice of the Lord from his native
country, and all his dear relations, and his father’s house; when the
Lord said “Get thee out from thy country and from thy kinsfolk and from
thy father’s house.” <span id="fr_1200"></span>[1201](#fn_1200) And in
this way we have heard that the blessed Antony also was called, <span
id="fr_1201"></span>[1202](#fn_1201) the occasion of whose conversion
was received from God alone. For on entering a church he there heard in
the Gospel the Lord saying: “Whoever hateth not father and mother and
children and wife and lands, yea and his own soul also, cannot be my
disciple;” and “if thou wilt be perfect, go sell all that thou hast, and
give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven, and come,
follow me:” <span id="fr_1202"></span>[1203](#fn_1202) And with
heartfelt contrition he took this charge of the Lord as if specially
aimed at him, and at once gave up everything and followed Christ,
without any incitement thereto from the advice and teaching of men. The
second kind of calling is that which we said took place through man;
viz., when we are stirred up by the example of some of the saints, and
their advice, and thus inflamed with the desire of salvation: and by
this we never forget that by the grace of the Lord we ourselves were
summoned, as we were aroused by the advice and good example of the
above-mentioned saint, to give ourselves up to this aim and calling; and
in this way also we find in Holy Scripture that it was through Moses
that the children of Israel were delivered from the Egyptian bondage.
But the third kind of calling is that which comes from compulsion, when
we have been involved in the riches and pleasures of this life, and
temptations suddenly come upon us and either threaten us with peril of
death, or smite us with the loss and confiscation of our goods, or
strike us down with the death of those dear to us, and thus at length
even against our will we are driven to turn to God whom we scorned to
follow in the days of our wealth. And of this compulsory call we often
find instances in Scripture, when we read that on account of their sins
the children of Israel were given up by the Lord to their enemies; and
that on account of their tyranny and savage cruelty they turned again,
and cried to the Lord. And it says: “The Lord sent them a Saviour,
called Ehud, the son of Gera, the son of Jemini, who used the left hand
as well as the right:” and again we are told, “they cried unto the Lord,
who raised them up a Saviour and delivered them, to wit, Othniel, the
son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother.” <span
id="fr_1203"></span>[1204](#fn_1203) And it is of such that the Psalm
speaks: “When He slew them, then they sought Him: and they returned and
came to Him early in the morning: and they remembered <span
id="page_321">p. 321</span> <span id="iv.iv.iv.iv-Page_321"></span>that
God was their helper, and the most High God their redeemer.” And again:
“And they cried unto the Lord when they were troubled, and He delivered
them out of their distress.” <span id="fr_1204"></span>[1205](#fn_1204)

<span id="iv.iv.iv.iv-p4"></span> The story, to which allusion is here
made, is given in the Vita Antonii of Athanasius. We are there told that
six months after the death of his parents Antony, then a young man of
eighteen, chanced to enter a church just as the gospel for the day was
being read: and hearing the words, “If thou wilt be perfect,” etc., he
took them as addressed specially to himself, and at once proceeded to
act upon them, selling all that he had except a small portion which he
reserved for his sister’s maintenance. Shortly after, he was struck by
the words, “Take no thought for the morrow,” which he heard in church,
and acting upon this, made away with the little property which was left,
committed his sister to the care of certain faithful virgins, and betook
himself to the ascetic life.
