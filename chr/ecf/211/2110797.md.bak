#### <span id="iv.iv.x.xxvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXVII.

<span id="iv.iv.x.xxvii-p1"></span>Of the different sorts of conviction.

<span id="iv.iv.x.xxvii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.x.xxvii-p2.1"></span>But</span> how and in what way those very
convictions are produced from the inmost recesses of the soul it is no
less difficult to trace out. For often through some inexpressible
delight and keenness of spirit the fruit of a most salutary conviction
arises so that it actually breaks forth into shouts owing to the
greatness of its incontrollable joy; and the delight of the heart and
greatness of exultation makes itself heard even in the cell of a
neighbour. But sometimes the mind hides itself in complete silence
within the secrets of a profound quiet, so that the amazement of a
sudden illumination chokes all sounds of words and the overawed spirit
either keeps all its feelings to itself or loses <span

<span id="page_397">p. 397</span> <span
id="iv.iv.x.xxvii-Page_397"></span>to God with groanings that cannot be
uttered. But sometimes it is filled with such overwhelming conviction
and grief that it cannot express it except by floods of tears.
