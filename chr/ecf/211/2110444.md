#### <span id="iv.iii.vii.xxviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXVIII.

<span id="iv.iii.vii.xxviii-p1"></span>That the victory over
covetousness can only be gained by stripping one’s self bare of
everything.

<span id="iv.iii.vii.xxviii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.vii.xxviii-p2.1"></span>This</span> then is the perfect
victory over covetousness: not to allow a gleam from the very smallest
scrap of it to remain in our heart, as we know that we shall have no
further power of quenching it, if we cherish even the tiniest bit of a
spark of it in us.
