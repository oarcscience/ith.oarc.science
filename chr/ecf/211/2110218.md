#### <span id="ii.vi.ii.xxix-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXIX.

<span id="ii.vi.ii.xxix-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.vi.ii.xxix-p1.1"></span>In</span> the meantime, the number of the
Christians being now very large, it happened that Rome was destroyed by
fire, while Nero was stationed at Antium. But the opinion of all cast
the odium of causing the fire upon the emperor, and he was believed in
this way to have sought for the glory of building a new city. And in
fact, Nero could not by any means he tried <span id="page_111">p.
111</span> <span id="ii.vi.ii.xxix-Page_111"></span>escape from the
charge that the fire had been caused by his orders. He therefore turned
the accusation against the Christians, and the most cruel tortures were
accordingly inflicted upon the innocent. Nay, even new kinds of death
were invented, so that, being covered in the skins of wild beasts, they
perished by being devoured by dogs, while many were crucified or slain
by fire, and not a few were set apart for this purpose, that, when the
day came to a close, they should be consumed to serve for light during
the night. In this way, cruelty first began to be manifested against the
Christians. Afterwards, too, their religion was prohibited by laws which
were enacted; and by edicts openly set forth it was proclaimed unlawful
to be a Christian. At that time Paul and Peter were condemned to death,
the former being beheaded with a sword, while Peter suffered
crucifixion. And while these things went on at Rome, the Jews, not able
to endure the injuries they suffered under the rule of Festus Florus,
began to rebel. Vespasian, being sent by Nero against them, with
proconsular power, defeated them in numerous important battles, and
compelled them to flee within the walls of Jerusalem. In the meanwhile
Nero, now hateful even to himself from a consciousness of his crimes,
disappears from among <span id="fr_354"></span>[355](#fn_354.md) men,
leaving it uncertain whether or not he had laid violent hands upon
himself: certainly his body was never found. It was accordingly believed
that, even if he did put an end to himself with a sword, his wound was
cured, and his life preserved, according to that which was written
regarding him,—“And his mortal <span id="fr_355"></span>[356](#fn_355.md)
wound was healed,”—to be sent forth again near the end of the world, in
order that he may practice the mystery of iniquity.
