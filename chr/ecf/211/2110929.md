#### <span id="iv.v.viii.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.

<span id="iv.v.viii.ix-p1"></span>How it is often better to break one’s
engagements than to fulfil them.

<span id="iv.v.viii.ix-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.viii.ix-p2.1"></span>And</span> both these points are very
clearly shown by the cases of S. Peter the Apostle and Herod. For the
former, because he departed from his expressed determination which he
had as it were confirmed with an oath saying “Thou shalt never wash my
feet,” <span id="fr_2015"></span>[2016](#fn_2015) gained an immortal
partnership with Christ, whereas he would certainly have been cut off
from the grace of this blessedness, if he had clung obstinately to his
word. But the latter, by clinging to the pledge of his ill-considered
oath, became the bloody murderer of the Lord’s forerunner, and through
the vain fear of perjury plunged himself into condemnation and the
punishment of everlasting death. In everything then we must consider the
end, and must according to it direct our course and aim, and if when
some wiser counsel supervenes, we see it diverging to the worse part, it
is better to discard the unsuitable arrangement, and to come to a better
mind rather than to cling obstinately to our engagements and so become
involved in worse sins.
