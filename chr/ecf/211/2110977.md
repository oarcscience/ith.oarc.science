#### <span id="iv.vi.iii.vii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.vii-p1"></span>A question on the fruits of the
Cœnobium and the desert.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.vii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.vii-p2.1"></span>Germanus</span>: Since it is evident that
you have not, like so many, just touched the mere outskirts of each mode
of life, but have ascended to the very heights, we should like to know
what is the end of the Cœnobite’s life and what the end of the hermit’s.
For no one can doubt that no man can discourse with greater fulness or
fidelity on these subjects than one who, taught by long use and
experience, has followed them both, and so can by veracious teaching
show us their value and aim.
