#### <span id="iv.iii.xii.xiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIV.

<span id="iv.iii.xii.xiv-p1"></span>That the help of God is given to
those who labour. <span id="fr_1051"></span>[1052](#fn_1051)

<span id="iv.iii.xii.xiv-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.xii.xiv-p3.1"></span>Nor</span> do I say this to cast a
slight on human efforts, or in the endeavour to discourage any one from
his purpose of working and doing his best. But clearly and most
earnestly do I lay down, not giving my own opinion, but that of the
elders, that perfection cannot possibly be gained without these, but
that by these only without the grace of God nobody can ever attain it.
For when we say that human efforts cannot of themselves secure it
without the aid of God, we thus insist that God’s mercy and grace are
bestowed only upon those who labour and exert themselves, and are
granted (to use the Apostle’s expression) to them that “will” and “run,”
according to that which is sung in the person of God in the
eighty-eighth Psalm: “I have laid help upon one that is mighty, and have
exalted one chosen out of my people.” <span
id="fr_1052"></span>[1053](#fn_1052) For we say, in accordance with
<span id="page_284">p. 284</span> <span
id="iv.iii.xii.xiv-Page_284"></span>our Saviour’s words, that it is
given to them that ask, and opened to them that knock and found by them
that seek; <span id="fr_1053"></span>[1054](#fn_1053) but that the
asking, the seeking, and the knocking on our part are insufficient
unless the mercy of God gives what we ask, and opens that at which we
knock, and enables us to find that which we seek. For He is at hand to
bestow all these things, if only the opportunity is given to Him by our
good will. For He desires and looks for our perfection and salvation far
more than we do ourselves. And the blessed David knew so well that by
his own efforts he could not secure the increase of his work and labour,
that he entreated with renewed prayers that he might obtain the
“direction” of his work from the Lord, saying, “Direct thou the work of
our hands over us; yea, the work of our hands do thou direct;” <span
id="fr_1054"></span>[1055](#fn_1054) and again: “Confirm, O God, what
thou hast wrought in us.” <span id="fr_1055"></span>[1056](#fn_1055)
