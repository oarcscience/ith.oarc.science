#### <span id="iv.iii.iv.xxxix-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXIX.

<span id="iv.iii.iv.xxxix-p1"></span>Of the way in which we shall mount
towards perfection, whereby we may afterwards ascend from the fear of
God up to love.

<span id="iv.iii.iv.xxxix-p2"></span>“<span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.iv.xxxix-p2.1"></span>The</span> beginning” of our salvation
and the safeguard of it is, as I said, “the fear of the Lord.” <span
id="fr_809"></span>[810](#fn_809.md) For through this those who are trained
in the way of perfection can gain a start in conversion as well as
purification from vices and security in virtue. And when this has gained
an entrance into a man’s heart it produces contempt of all things, and
begets a forgetfulness of kinsfolk and an horror of the world itself.
But by the contempt for the loss of all possessions humility is gained.
And humility is attested by these signs: First of all if a man has all
his desires mortified; secondly, if he conceals none of his actions or
even of his thoughts from his superior; thirdly, if he puts no trust in
his own opinion, but all in the judgment of his superior, and listens
eagerly and willingly to his directions; fourthly, if he maintains in
everything obedience and gentleness and constant patience; fifthly, if
he not only hurts nobody else, but also is not annoyed or vexed at
wrongs done to himself; sixthly, if he does nothing and ventures on
nothing to which he is not urged by the Common Rule or by the example of
our elders; seventhly, if he is contented with the lowest possible
position, and considers himself as a bad workman and unworthy in the
case of everything enjoined to him; eighthly, if he does not only
outwardly profess with his lips that he is inferior to all, but really
believes it in the inmost thoughts of his heart; ninthly, if he governs
his tongue, and is not over talkative; tenthly, if he is not easily
moved or too ready to laugh. For by such signs and the like is true
humility recognised. And when this has once been genuinely secured, then
at once it leads you on by a still higher step to love which knows no
fear; <span id="fr_810"></span>[811](#fn_810.md) and through this you
begin, without any effort and as it were naturally, to keep up
everything that you formerly observed not without fear of punishment; no
longer now from regard of punishment or fear of it but from love of
goodness itself, and delight in virtue. <span

<span id="iv.iii.iv.xxxix-p5"></span> With this chapter there should be
compared the Rule of S. Benedict c. vii., where a very similar
description is given of twelve grades “on the mystic ladder \[of
humility\] which Jacob saw,” evidently suggested by the chapter before
us.
