#### <span id="ii.vi.i.xxxi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXI.

<span id="ii.vi.i.xxxi-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.vi.i.xxxi-p1.1"></span>The</span> Philistines, victorious in this
prosperous battle, brought the ark of God, which had fallen into their
hands, into the temple of Dagon in the town of Azotus. But the image,
dedicated to a demon, fell down when the ark was brought in there; and,
on their setting the idol up again <span id="page_86">p. 86</span> <span
id="ii.vi.i.xxxi-Page_86"></span>in its place, in the following night it
was torn in pieces. Then mice, springing up throughout all the country,
caused by their venomous bites the death of many thousand persons. <span
id="fr_297"></span>[298](#fn_297.md) The men of Azotus, constrained by this
source of suffering, in order to escape the calamity, removed the ark to
Gath. But the people there being afflicted with the same evils, conveyed
the ark to Ascalon. The inhabitants, however, of that place, the chief
men of the nation having been called together, formed the design of
sending back the ark to the Hebrews. Thus, in accordance with the
opinion of the chiefs, and augurs, and priests, it was placed upon a
cart, and sent back with many gifts. This remarkable thing then
happened, that when they had yoked heifers to the conveyance, and had
retained their calves at home, these cattle took their course, without
any guide, towards Judæa, and showed no desire of returning, from
affection toward their young left behind. The rulers of the Philistines,
who had followed the ark into the territory of the Hebrews, were so
struck by the marvelousness of this occurrence that they performed a
religious service. But the Jews, when they saw the ark brought back,
vied with each other in joyously rushing forth from the town of Betsamis
to meet it, and in hurrying, exulting, and returning thanks to God.
Presently, the Levites, whose business it was, perform a sacrifice to
God, and offer those heifers which had brought the ark. But the ark
could not be kept in the town which I have named above, and thus severe
illness fell by the appointment of God, upon the whole city. The ark was
then transferred to the town of Cariathiarim, <span
id="fr_298"></span>[299](#fn_298.md) and there it remained twenty years.
