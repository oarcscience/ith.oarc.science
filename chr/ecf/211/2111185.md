#### <span id="iv.vii.viii.x-p0.1"></span>Chapter X.

<span id="iv.vii.viii.x-p1"></span>He collects more witnesses of the
same fact.

<span id="iv.vii.viii.x-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.viii.x-p2.1"></span>But</span> why am I lingering so long
over one instance, as if many were wanting? For even then how could the
fact that God was to come in the flesh escape the knowledge of men, when
the Prophet said openly as if to all mankind of Him: “Behold your God;”
and elsewhere: “Behold our God.” And this: “God the mighty, the Father
of the world to come, the Prince of Peace;” and: “of His kingdom there
shall be no end.” <span id="fr_2616"></span>[2617](#fn_2616) But also
when He had already come, could the fact of His having come escape the
knowledge of those who openly confessed that He had come? Was Peter
ignorant of the coming of God, when he said, “Thou art the Christ, the
Son of the living God?” <span id="fr_2617"></span>[2618](#fn_2617) Did
not Martha know what she was saying or whom she believed in, when she
said, “Yea, Lord, I have believed that Thou art the Christ, the Son of
the living God, who art come into this world?” <span
id="fr_2618"></span>[2619](#fn_2618) And all those men, who sought from
Him the cure of their sicknesses, or the restoration of their limbs, or
the life of their dead, did they ask these things from man’s weakness,
or from God’s omnipotence?
