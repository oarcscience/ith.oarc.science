#### <span id="iv.iv.iv.xii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XII.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xii-p1"></span>The answer on the economy of Divine
Grace, with free will still remaining in us.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.iv.xii-p2.1"></span>Paphnutius</span>: This would fairly
influence us, if in every work and practice, the beginning and the end
were everything, and there were no middle in between. And so as we know
that God creates opportunities of salvation in various ways, it is in
our power to make use of the opportunities granted to us by heaven more
or less earnestly. For just as the offer came from God Who called him
“get thee out of thy country,” so the obedience was on the part of
Abraham who went forth; and as the fact that the saying “Come into the
land” was carried into action, was the work of him who obeyed, so the
addition of the <span id="page_326">p. 326</span> <span
id="iv.iv.iv.xii-Page_326"></span>words “which I will show thee” came
from the grace of God Who commanded or promised it. But it is well for
us to be sure that although we practise every virtue with unceasing
efforts, yet with all our exertions and zeal we can never arrive at
perfection, nor is mere human diligence and toil of itself sufficient to
deserve to reach the splendid reward of bliss, unless we have secured it
by means of the co-operation of the Lord, and His directing our heart to
what is right. And so we ought every moment to pray and say with David
“Order my steps in thy paths that my footsteps slip not:” <span
id="fr_1245"></span>[1246](#fn_1245) and “He hath set my feet upon a
rock and ordered my goings:” <span id="fr_1246"></span>[1247](#fn_1246)
that He Who is the unseen ruler of the human heart may vouchsafe to turn
to the desire of virtue that will of ours, which is more readily
inclined to vice either through want of knowledge of what is good, or
through the delights of passion. And we read this in a verse in which
the prophet sings very plainly: “Being pushed I was overturned that I
might fall,” where the weakness of our free will is shown. And “the Lord
sustained me:” <span id="fr_1247"></span>[1248](#fn_1247) again this
shows that the Lord’s help is always joined to it, and by this, that we
may not be altogether destroyed by our free will, when He sees that we
have stumbled, He sustains and supports us, as it were by stretching out
His hand. And again: “If I said my foot was moved;” viz., from the
slippery character of the will, “Thy mercy, O Lord, helped me.” <span
id="fr_1248"></span>[1249](#fn_1248) Once more he joins on the help of
God to his own weakness, as he confesses that it was not owing to his
own efforts but to the mercy of God, that the foot of his faith was not
moved. And again: “According to the multitude of the sorrows which I had
in my heart,” which sprang most certainly from my free will, “Thy
comforts have refreshed my soul,” <span
id="fr_1249"></span>[1250](#fn_1249) i.e., by coming through Thy
inspiration into my heart, and laying open the view of future blessings
which Thou hast prepared for them who labour in Thy name, they not only
removed all anxiety from my heart, but actually conferred upon it the
greatest delight. And again: “Had it not been that the Lord helped me,
my soul had almost dwelt in hell.” <span
id="fr_1250"></span>[1251](#fn_1250) He certainly shows that through the
depravity of this free will he would have dwelt in hell, had he not been
saved by the assistance and protection of the Lord. For “By the Lord,”
and not by free-will, “are a man’s steps directed,” and “although the
righteous fall” at least by free will, “he shall not be cast away.” And
why? because “the Lord upholdeth him with His hand:” <span
id="fr_1251"></span>[1252](#fn_1251) and this is to say with the utmost
clearness: None of the righteous are sufficient of themselves to acquire
righteousness, unless every moment when they stumble and fall the Divine
mercy supports them with His hands, that they may not utterly collapse
and perish, when they have been cast down through the weakness of free
will.
