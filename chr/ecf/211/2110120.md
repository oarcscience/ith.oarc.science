#### <span id="ii.v.ii.xii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XII.

<span id="ii.v.ii.xii-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.ii.xii-p1.1"></span>O Virgin</span>, maintain thy purpose which
is destined for a great reward. Eminent with the Lord is the virtue of
virginity and purity, if it be not disfigured by other kinds of lapses
into sins and wickedness. Realize your state, realize your position,
realize your purpose. You are called the bride of Christ; see that you
commit no act which is unworthy of him to whom you profess to be
betrothed. He will quickly write a bill of divorcement, if he perceive
in you even one act of unfaithfulness. Accordingly, whosoever receives
those gifts which, as an earnest, are bestowed in the case of human
betrothals, immediately begins earnestly and diligently to enquire of
domestics, intimates, and friends, what is the character of the young
man, what he especially loves, what he receives, in what style he lives,
what habits he practices, what luxuries he indulges in, and in what
pursuits he finds his chief pleasure and delight. And when she has
learned these things, she so conducts herself, in all respects, that her
service, her cheerfulness, her diligence, and her whole mode of life,
may be in harmony with the character of her betrothed. And do thou, who
hast Christ as thy bridegroom, enquire from the domestics and intimates
of that bridegroom of thine what is his character; yes, do thou
zealously and skillfully enquire in what things he specially delights,
what sort of arrangement he loves in thy dress, and what kind of
adornment he desires. Let his most intimate associate Peter tell thee,
who does not allow personal adorning even to married women, as he has
written in his epistle, “Let wives, <span
id="fr_208"></span>[209](#fn_208) in like manner, be subject to their
own husbands, so that, if any believe not the word, they may, without
the word, be won over by the conduct of their wives, contemplating their
chaste behavior in the fear of God; and let theirs not be an outward
adornment of the hair, or the putting on of gold, or elegance in the
apparel which is adopted, but let there be the hidden man of the heart
in the stainlessness <span id="fr_209"></span>[210](#fn_209) of a
peaceful and modest spirit, which is in the sight of God of great
price.” Let another apostle also tell thee, the blessed Paul, who,
writing to Timothy, gives his approval to the same things in regard to
the conduct of believing women: “Let wives <span
id="fr_210"></span>[211](#fn_210) in like manner adorn themselves with
the ornament of a habit of modesty and sobriety, not with curled hair,
or gold, or pearls, or costly array, but as becomes women that profess
chastity, with good and upright behavior.”
