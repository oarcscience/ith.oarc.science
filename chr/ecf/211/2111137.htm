<p class="subh"><a name="iv.vii.vi.ii-p1"></A>That the doctrine of Nestorius is closely connected with the error of the Pelagians.</p>  
<p class="skip"><a name="iv.vii.vi.ii-p2"></A><span class="sc"><a name="iv.vii.vi.ii-p2.1"></A>You</span> say then that Christ was born a mere man. But certainly this was asserted by that wicked heresy of Pelagius, as we clearly showed in the first book; viz., that Christ was born a mere man. You add besides, that Jesus Christ the Lord of all should be termed a form that received God (<span class="Greek"><a name="iv.vii.vi.ii-p2.2"></A>&#920;&#949;&#959;&#948;&#8057;&#967;&#959;&#962;)</span>, i.e., not God, but the receiver of God, so that your view is that He is to be honoured not for His own sake because He is God, but because He receives God into Himself. But clearly this also was asserted by that heresy of which I spoke before; viz., that Christ was not to be worshipped for His own sake because He was God, but because owing to His good and pious actions He won this; viz., to have God dwelling in Him. You see then that you are belching out the poison of Pelagianism, and hissing with the very spirit of Pelagianism. Whence it comes that you seem rather to have been already judged, than to have now to undergo judgment, for since your error is one and the same, you must be believed to fall under the same condemnation: not to mention for the present that you compare the Lord to a statue of the Emperor, and break out into such wicked and blasphemous impieties that you seem in this madness of yours to surpass even Pelagius himself, who surpassed almost every one else in impiety.</p>
