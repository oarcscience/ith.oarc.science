#### <span id="iv.iii.x.xxiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXIV.

<span id="iv.iii.x.xxiv-p1"></span>Abbot Paul <span
id="fr_999"></span>[1000](#fn_999.md) who every year burnt with fire all
the works of his hands.

<span id="iv.iii.x.xxiv-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.x.xxiv-p3.1"></span>Lastly</span>, Abbot Paul, one of the
greatest of the Fathers, while he was living in a vast desert which is
called the Porphyrian desert, <span id="fr_1000"></span>[1001](#fn_1000.md)
and being relieved from anxiety by the date palms and a small garden,
had plenty to support himself, and an ample supply of food, and could
not find any other work to do, which would support him, because his
dwelling was separated from towns and inhabited districts by seven days’
journey, <span id="fr_1001"></span>[1002](#fn_1001.md) or even more,
through the desert, and more would be asked for the carriage of the
goods than the price of the work would be worth; he collected the leaves
of the palms, and regularly exacted of himself his daily task, as if he
was to be supported <span id="page_275">p. 275</span> <span
id="iv.iii.x.xxiv-Page_275"></span>by it. And when his cave had been
filled with a whole year’s work, each year he would burn with fire that
at which he had so diligently laboured: thus proving that without manual
labour a monk cannot stop in a place nor rise to the heights of
perfection: so that, though the need for food did not require this to be
done, yet he performed it simply for the sake of purifying his heart,
and strengthening his thoughts, and persisting in his cell, and gaining
a victory over accidie and driving it away.

id="iv.iii.x.xxiv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.x.xxiv-p2"></span> This Paul is perhaps the same as the
one mentioned in connection with Abbot Moses in Conference VII. xxvi. As
he was a contemporary of Cassian he must be carefully distinguished from
his more illustrious namesakes, the first hermit and the disciple of S.
Antony.

<span id="iv.iii.x.xxiv-p4"></span> Also called the desert of Calamus,
Conference XXIV. iv., but its position has not been ascertained.

<span id="iv.iii.x.xxiv-p5"></span> *Mansio* used here and again in
Conference XXIV. iv. for the stage of a day’s journey.
