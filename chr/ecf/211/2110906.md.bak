#### <span id="iv.v.vii.xv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XV.

<span id="iv.v.vii.xv-p1"></span>Of those who only increase their own or
their brother’s grievances by hiding them.

<span id="iv.v.vii.xv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.vii.xv-p2.1"></span>On</span> the other hand we know (and O!
would that we did not know) some of the brethren who are so hard and
obstinate, that when they know that their own feelings are aroused
against their brother, or that their brother’s are against them, in
order to conceal their vexation of mind, which is caused by indignation
at the grievance of one or the other, go apart from those whom they
ought to smooth down by humbly making up to them and talking with them;
and begin to sing some verses of the Psalms. And these while they fancy
that they are softening the bitter thoughts which have arisen in their
heart, increase by their insolent conduct what they could have got rid
of at once if they had been willing to show more care and humility, for
a well-timed expression of regret would cure their own feelings and
soften their brother’s heart. For by that plan they nourish and cherish
the sin of meanness or rather of pride, instead of stamping out all
inducement to quarrelling, and they forget the charge of the Lord which
says: “Whosoever is angry with his brother, is in danger of the
judgment;” and: “if thou remember that thy brother hath aught against
thee, leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way, first be
reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.” <span
