#### <span id="ii.iv.ii.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.

<span id="ii.iv.ii.ix-p1"></span>“<span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.ii.ix-p1.1"></span>About</span> the same time, a cow which a
demon harassed met Martin as he was returning from Treves. That cow,
leaving its proper herd, was accustomed to attack human beings, and had
already seriously gored many with its horns. Now, when she was coming
near us, those who followed her from a distance began to warn us, with a
loud voice, to beware of her. But after she had in great fury come
pretty near to us, with rage in her eyes, Martin, lifting up his hand,
ordered the animal to halt, and she immediately stood stock-still at his
word. Upon this, Martin perceived a demon sitting upon her back, and
reproving it, he exclaimed, ‘Begone, <span id="page_43">p. 43</span>
<span id="ii.iv.ii.ix-Page_43"></span>thou deadly being; leave the
innocent beast, and cease any longer to torment it.’ The evil spirit
obeyed and departed. And the heifer had sense enough to understand that
she was set free; for, peace being restored to her, she fell at the feet
of the holy man; and on Martin directing her, she made for her own herd,
and, quieter than any sheep, she joined the rest of the band. This also
was the time at which he had no sensation of being burnt, although
placed in the midst of the flames; but I do not think it necessary for
me to give an account of this, because Sulpitius there, though passing
over it in his book, has nevertheless pretty fully narrated it in the
epistle which he sent to Eusebius, who was then a presbyter, and is now
a bishop. I believe, Postumianus, you have either read this letter, or,
if it is still unknown to you, you may easily obtain it, when you
please, from the bookcase. I shall simply narrate particulars which he
has omitted.

<span id="ii.iv.ii.ix-p2"></span>“Well, on a certain occasion, when he
was going round the various parishes, we came upon a band of huntsmen.
The dogs were pursuing a hare, and the little animal was already much
exhausted by the long run it had had. When it perceived no means of
escape in the plains spreading far on every side, and was several times
just on the point of being captured, it tried to delay the threatened
death by frequent doublings. Now the blessed man pitied the danger of
the creature with pious feelings, and commanded the dogs to give up
following it, and to permit it to get safe away. Instantly, at the first
command they heard, they stood quite still: one might have thought them
bound, or rather arrested, so as to stand immovable in their own
footprints. In this way, through her pursuers being stopped as if tied
together, the hare got safe away.
