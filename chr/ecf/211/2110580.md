#### <span id="iv.iv.ii.xiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIII.

<span id="iv.iv.ii.xiii-p1"></span>The answer concerning the direction
of the heart towards and concerning the kingdom of God and the kingdom
of the devil.

<span id="iv.iv.ii.xiii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.ii.xiii-p2.1"></span>Moses</span>. To cling to God
continually, and as you say inseparably to hold fast to meditation on
Him, is impossible for a man while still in this weak flesh of ours. But
we ought to be aware on what we should have the purpose of our mind
fixed, and to what goal we should ever recall the gaze of our soul: and
when the mind can secure this it may rejoice; and grieve and sigh when
it is withdrawn from this, and as often as it discovers itself to have
fallen away from gazing on Him, it should admit that it has lapsed from
the highest good, considering that even a momentary departure from
gazing on Christ is fornication. And when our gaze has wandered ever so
little from Him, let us turn the eyes of the soul back to Him, and
recall our mental gaze as in a perfectly straight direction. For
everything depends on the inward frame of mind, and when the devil has
been expelled from this, and sins no longer reign in it, it follows that
the kingdom of God is founded in us, as the Evangelist says “The kingdom
of God cometh not with observation, nor shall men say Lo here, or lo
there: for verily I say unto you that the kingdom of God is within
you.” <span id="fr_1099"></span>[1100](#fn_1099.md) But nothing else can be
“within you,” but knowledge or ignorance of truth, and delight either in
vice or in virtue, through which we prepare a kingdom for the devil or
for Christ in our heart: and of this kingdom the Apostle describes the
character, when he says “For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink,
but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost.” <span
id="fr_1100"></span>[1101](#fn_1100.md) And so if the kingdom of God is
within us, and the actual kingdom of God is righteousness and peace and
joy, then the man who abides in these is most certainly in the kingdom
of God, and on the contrary those who live in unrighteousness, and
discord, and the sorrow that worketh death, have their place in the
kingdom of the devil, and in hell and death. For by these tokens the
kingdom of God and the kingdom of the devil are distinguished: and in
truth if lifting up our mental gaze on high we would consider that state
in which the heavenly powers live on high, who are truly in the kingdom
of God, what should we imagine it to be except perpetual and lasting
joy? For what is so specially peculiar and appropriate to true
blessedness as constant calm and eternal joy? And that you may be quite
sure that this, which we say, is really so, not on my own authority but
on that of the Lord, hear how very clearly He describes the character
and condition of that world: “Behold,” says He, “I create new heavens
and a new earth: and the former things shall not be remembered nor come
into mind. But ye shall be glad and rejoice forever in that which I
create.” <span id="fr_1101"></span>[1102](#fn_1101.md) And again “joy and
gladness shall be found therein: thanksgiving and the voice of praise,
and there shall be month after month, and Sabbath after Sabbath.” <span
id="fr_1102"></span>[1103](#fn_1102.md) And again: “they shall obtain joy
and gladness; and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.” <span
id="fr_1103"></span>[1104](#fn_1103.md) And if you want to know more
definitely about that life and the city of the saints, hear what the
voice of the Lord proclaims to the heavenly Jerusalem herself: “I will
make,” says He, “thine officers peace and thine overseers righteousness.
Violence shall no more be heard in thy land, desolation nor destruction
within thy borders. And salvation shall take possession of thy walls,
and praise of thy gates. The sun shall be no more thy light by day,
neither shall the brightness of the moon give light to thee: but the
Lord shall be <span id="page_301">p. 301</span> <span
id="iv.iv.ii.xiii-Page_301"></span>thine everlasting light, and thy God
thy glory. Thy sun shall no more go down, neither shall thy moon
withdraw itself: but the Lord shall be thine everlasting light, and the
days of thy mourning shall be ended:” <span
id="fr_1104"></span>[1105](#fn_1104.md) and therefore the holy Apostle does
not say generally or without qualification that every joy is the kingdom
of God, but markedly and emphatically that joy alone which is “in the
Holy Ghost.” <span id="fr_1105"></span>[1106](#fn_1105.md) For he was
perfectly aware of another detestable joy, of which we hear “the world
shall rejoice,” <span id="fr_1106"></span>[1107](#fn_1106.md) and “woe unto
you that laugh, for ye shall mourn.” <span
id="fr_1107"></span>[1108](#fn_1107.md) In fact the kingdom of heaven must
be taken in a threefold sense, either that the heavens shall reign,
i.e., the saints over other things subdued, according to this text, “Be
thou over five cities, and thou over ten;” <span
id="fr_1108"></span>[1109](#fn_1108.md) and this which is said to the
disciples: “Ye shall sit upon twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes
of Israel:” <span id="fr_1109"></span>[1110](#fn_1109.md) or that the
heavens themselves shall begin to be reigned over by Christ, when “all
things are subdued unto Him,” and God begins to be “all in all:” <span
id="fr_1110"></span>[1111](#fn_1110.md) or else that the saints shall reign
in heaven with the Lord.
