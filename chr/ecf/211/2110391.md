#### <span id="iv.iii.v.xviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.

<span id="iv.iii.v.xviii-p1"></span>Of the number of different conflicts
and victories through which the blessed Apostle ascended to the crown of
the highest combat.

<span id="iv.iii.v.xviii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.v.xviii-p2.1"></span>But</span> he does not mean that he has
only finished the contest of a race when he says “I so run, not as
uncertainly” (a phrase which has more particularly to do with the
intention of the mind and fervour of his spirit, in which he followed
Christ with all zeal, crying out with the Bride, “We will run after thee
for the odour of thine ointments;” <span
id="fr_852"></span>[853](#fn_852.md) and again, “My soul cleaveth unto
thee:” <span id="fr_853"></span>[854](#fn_853.md) but he also testifies
that he has conquered in another kind of contest, saying, “So fight I,
not as one that beateth the air, but I chastise my body and bring it
into subjection.” And this properly has to do with the pains of
abstinence, and bodily fasting and affliction of the flesh: as he means
by this that he is a vigorous bruiser of his own flesh, and points out
that not in vain has he planted his blows of continence against it; but
that he has gained a battle triumph by mortifying his own body; for when
it is chastised with the blows of continence and struck down with the
boxing-gloves of fasting, he has secured for his victorious spirit the
crown of immortality and the prize of incorruption. You see the orthodox
method of the contest, and consider the issue of spiritual combats: how
the athlete of Christ having gained a victory over the rebellious flesh,
having cast it as it were under his feet, is carried forward as
triumphing on high. And therefore “he does not run uncertainly,” because
he trusts that he will forthwith enter the holy city, the heavenly
Jerusalem. He “so fights,” that is with fasts and humiliation of the
flesh, “not as one that beateth the air,” that is, striking into space
with blows of continence, through which he struck not the empty air, but
those spirits who inhabit it, by the chastisement of his body. For one
who says “not as one that beateth the air,” shows that he strikes—not
empty and void air, but certain beings in the air. And because he had
overcome in this kind of contest, and marched on enriched with the
rewards of many crowns, not undeservedly does he begin to enter the
lists against still more powerful foes, and having triumphed over his
former rivals, he boldly makes proclamation and says, “Now our striving
is not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against
powers, against world-rulers of this darkness, against spiritual
wickedness in heavenly places.” <span id="fr_854"></span>[855](#fn_854.md)
