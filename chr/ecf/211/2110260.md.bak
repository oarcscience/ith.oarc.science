#### <span id="iii.xix-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.

<span id="iii.xix-p1"></span>Tertullian a great Trial to the Church.

<span id="iii.xix-p2"></span>\[46.\] <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.xix-p2.1"></span>The</span> case is the same with
Tertullian. <span id="fr_489"></span>[490](#fn_489.md) For as Origen holds
by far the first place among the Greeks, so does Tertullian among the
Latins. For who more learned than he, who more versed in knowledge
whether divine or human? With marvellous capacity of mind he
comprehended all philosophy, and had a knowledge of all schools of
philosophers, and of the founders and upholders of schools, and was
acquainted with all their rules and observances, and with their various
histories and studies. Was not his genius of such unrivalled strength
and vehemence that there was scarcely any obstacle which he proposed to
himself to overcome, that he did not penetrate by acuteness, or crush by
weight? As to his style, who can sufficiently set forth its praise? It
was knit together with so much cogency of argument that it compelled
assent, even where it failed to persuade. Every word almost was a
sentence; every sentence a victory. This know the Marcions, the
Apelleses, the Praxeases, the Hermogeneses, the Jews, the Heathens, the
Gnostics, and the rest, whose blasphemies he overthrew by the force of
his many and ponderous volumes, as with so many thunderbolts. Yet this
man also, notwithstanding all that I have mentioned, this Tertullian, I
say, too little tenacious of Catholic doctrine, that is, of the
universal and ancient faith, more eloquent by far than faithful, <span
id="fr_490"></span>[491](#fn_490.md) changed his belief, and justified what
the blessed Confessor, Hilary, writes of him, namely, that “by his
subsequent error he detracted from the authority of his approved
writings.” <span id="fr_491"></span>[492](#fn_491.md) He also was a great
trial in the Church. But of Tertullian I am unwilling to say more. This
only I will add, that, contrary to the injunction of Moses, by asserting
the novel furies of Montanus <span id="fr_492"></span>[493](#fn_492.md)
which arose in the Church, and those mad dreams of new doctrine dreamed
by mad women, to be true prophecies, he deservedly made both himself and
his writings obnoxious to the words, “If there arise a prophet in the
midst of thee,”…“thou shalt not hearken to the words of that prophet.
“For why? “Because the Lord your God doth make trial of you, whether you
love Him or not.”

<span id="iii.xix-p3"></span> Hardly anything is known of Tertullian,
besides what may be gathered from his works, in addition to the
following account given by St. Jerome (*De Viris Illustribus*), which I
quote from Bishop Kaye’s work on Tertullian and his writings:
“Tertullian, a presbyter, the first Latin writer after Victor and
Apollonius, was a native of the province of Africa and city of Carthage,
the son of a proconsular centurion. He was a man of a sharp and vehement
temper, flourished under Severus and Caracalla, and wrote numerous works
which, as they are generally known, I think it unnecessary to
particularize. I saw at Concordia, in Italy, an old man named Paulus who
said that, when young, he had met at Rome with an aged amanuensis of the
blessed Cyprian, who told him that Cyprian never passed a day without
reading some portion of Tertullian’s works, and used frequently to say,
‘Give me my master,’ meaning Tertullian. After remaining a presbyter of
the Church till he had attained the middle of life, Tertullian was by
the cruel and contumelious treatment of the Roman clergy driven to
embrace the opinions of Montanus, which he has mentioned in several of
his works, under the title of ‘The New Prophecy.’ He is reported to have
lived to a very advanced age.” He was born about the middle of the
second century, and flourished, according to the dates indicated above,
between the years 190 and 216.

id="iii.xix-p5.2"></span>

<span id="iii.xix-p6"></span> Montanus, with his two prophetesses,
professed that he was intrusted with a new dispensation,—a dispensation
in advance of the Gospel, as the Gospel was in advance of the Law. His
system was a protest against the laxity which had grown up in the
Church, as has repeatedly been the case after revivals of religious
fervor, verifying Tertullian’s apophthegm, “Christiani fiunt, non
nascuntur” (men become Christians, they are not born such). Its
characteristics were extreme ascetism, rigorous fasting, the exaltation
of celibacy, the absolute prohibition of second marriage, the
expectation of our Lord’s second advent as near at hand, the
disparagement of the clergy in comparison with its own
Paraclete-inspired teachers. It had its rise in Phrygia, and from thence
spread throughout Asia Minor, thence it found its way to Southern Gaul,
to Rome, to North Western Africa, in which last for a time it had many
followers.
