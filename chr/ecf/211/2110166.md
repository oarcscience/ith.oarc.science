#### <span id="ii.vi.i.xxxii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXII.

<span id="ii.vi.i.xxxii-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.vi.i.xxxii-p1.1"></span>At</span> this time, Samuel the
priest <span id="fr_299"></span>[300](#fn_299.md) ruled over the Hebrews;
and there being a cessation of all war, the people lived in peace. But
this tranquillity was disturbed by an invasion of the Philistines, and
all ranks were in a state of terror from their consciousness of guilt.
Samuel, having first offered sacrifice, and trusting in God, led his men
out to battle, and the enemy being routed at the first onset, victory
declared for the Hebrews. But when the fear of the enemy was thus
removed, and affairs were now prosperous and peaceful, the people,
changing their views for the worse, after the manner of the mob, who are
always weary of what they have, and long for things of which they have
had no experience, expressed a desire for the kingly name—a name greatly
disliked by almost all free nations. Yes, with an example of madness
certainly very remarkable, they now preferred to exchange liberty for
slavery. They, therefore, come in great numbers to Samuel, in order
that, as he himself was now an old man, he might make for them a king.
But he endeavored in a useful address, quietly to deter the people from
their insane desire; he set forth the tyranny and haughty rule of kings,
while he extolled liberty, and denounced slavery; finally, he threatened
them with the divine wrath, if they should show themselves men so
corrupt in mind as that, when having God as their king, they should
demand for themselves a king from among men. Having spoken these and
other words of a like nature to no purpose, finding that the people
persisted in the determination, he consulted God. And God, moved by the
madness of that insane nation, replied that nothing was to be refused to
them asking against their own interests.
