<span id="iv.v.ii.vii"></span>

#### <span id="iv.v.ii.vii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.

<span id="iv.v.ii.vii-p1"></span>By what steps we can ascend to the
heights of love and what permanence there is in it.

<span id="iv.v.ii.vii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.ii.vii-p2.1"></span>If</span> then any one is aiming at
perfection, from that first stage of fear which we rightly termed
servile (of which it is said: “When ye have done all things say: we are
unprofitable servants,” <span id="fr_1696"></span>[1697](#fn_1696) .md) he
should by advancing a step mount to the higher path of hope—which is
compared not to a slave but to a hireling, because it looks for the
payment of its recompense, and as if it were free from care concerning
absolution of its sins and fear of punishment, and conscious of its own
good works, though it seems to look for the promised reward, yet it
cannot attain to that love of a son who, trusting in his father’s
kindness and liberality, has no doubt that all that the father has is
his, to which also that prodigal who together with his father’s
substance had lost the very name of son, did not venture to aspire, when
he said: “I am no more worthy to be called thy son;” for after those
husks which the swine ate, satisfaction from which was denied to him,
i.e., the disgusting food of sin, as he “came to himself,” and was
overcome by a salutary fear, he already began to loathe the uncleanness
of the swine, and to dread the punishment of gnawing hunger, and as if
he had already been made a servant, desires the condition of a hireling
and thinks about the remuneration, and says: “How many hired servants of
my father have abundance of bread, and I perish here with hunger. I will
then return to my father and will say unto him, ‘Father I have sinned
against heaven and before thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy
son: make me as one of thy hired servants.’” <span
id="fr_1697"></span>[1698](#fn_1697.md) But those words of humble penitence
his father who ran to meet him received with greater affection than that
with which they were spoken, and was not content to allow him lesser
things, but passing through the two stages without delay restored him to
his former dignity of sonship. We also ought forthwith to hasten on that
by means of the indissoluble grace of love we may mount to that third
stage of sonship, which believes that all that the father has is its
own, and so we may be counted worthy to receive the image and likeness
of our heavenly Father, and be able to say after the likeness of the
true son: “All that the Father hath is mine.” <span
id="fr_1698"></span>[1699](#fn_1698.md) Which also the blessed Apostle
declares of us, saying: “All things are yours, whether Paul or Apollos
or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things
to come; all are yours.” <span id="fr_1699"></span>[1700](#fn_1699.md) And
to this likeness the commands of our Saviour also summon us: “Be ye,”
says He, “perfect, even as your Father in heaven is perfect.” <span
id="fr_1700"></span>[1701](#fn_1700.md) For in these persons sometimes the
love of goodness is found to be interrupted, when the vigour of the soul
is relaxed by some coldness or joy or delight, and so loses either the
fear of hell for the time, or the desire of future blessings. And there
is indeed in these a stage leading to some advance, which affects us so
that when from fear of punishment or from hope of reward we begin to
avoid sin we are enabled to pass on to the stage of love, for “fear,”
says one, “is not in love, but perfect love casteth out fear: for fear
hath torment, but he who fears is not perfect in love. We therefore love
because God first loved us.” <span id="fr_1701"></span>[1702](#fn_1701.md)
We can then only ascend to that true perfection when, as He first loved
us for the grace of nothing but our salvation, we also have loved Him
for the sake of nothing but His own love alone. Wherefore we must do our
best to mount with <span id="page_418">p. 418</span> <span
id="iv.v.ii.vii-Page_418"></span>perfect ardour of mind from this fear
to hope, from hope to the love of God, and the love of the virtues
themselves, that as we steadily pass on to the love of goodness itself,
we may, as far as it is possible for human nature, keep firm hold of
what is good.
