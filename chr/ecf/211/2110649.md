#### <span id="iv.iv.v.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VIII.

<span id="iv.iv.v.viii-p1"></span>A question, how it is that in the
Apostle’s chapter, after he has spoken of the lusts of the flesh and
spirit opposing one another, he adds a third thing; viz., man’s will.

<span id="iv.iv.v.viii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.v.viii-p2.1"></span>Germanus</span>: Although some glimmer of
the sense now seems clear to us, yet as we cannot thoroughly grasp the
Apostle’s meaning, we want you to explain this more clearly to us. For
the existence of three things seems to be indicated here: first, the
struggle of the flesh against the spirit, secondly the desire of the
spirit against the flesh, and thirdly our own free will, which seems to
be placed between the two, and of which it is said: “Ye should not do
what ye will.” And on this subject though as I said we can gather some
hints, from what you have explained of the meaning, yet—since this
conference gives the opportunity—we are anxious to have it more fully
explained to us.
