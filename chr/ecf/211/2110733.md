#### <span id="iv.iv.viii.xxiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXIV.

<span id="iv.iv.viii.xxiv-p1"></span>Of the way in which the devils
prepare for themselves an entrance into the bodies of those whom they
are going to possess.

<span id="iv.iv.viii.xxiv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.viii.xxiv-p2.1"></span>It</span> is clear then that unclean
spirits cannot make their way into those whose bodies they are going to
seize upon, in any other way than by first taking possession of their
minds and thoughts. And when they have robbed them of fear and the
recollection of God and spiritual meditation, they boldly advance upon
them, as if they were dispossessed of all protection and Divine
safeguard, and could easily be bound, and then take up their dwelling in
them as if in a possession given over to them.

possessed by sins than those who are possessed by devils.](2110734)
