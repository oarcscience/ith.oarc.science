#### <span id="iv.v.viii.xxii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXII.

<span id="iv.v.viii.xxii-p1"></span>An objection, that abstinence ought
to be concealed, but that things that have been declined should not be
received.

<span id="iv.v.viii.xxii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.viii.xxii-p2.1"></span>Germanus</span>: In the former instance
we think there can be no doubt that it is better for our abstinence to
be hidden than for it to be displayed to the inquirers, and in cases of
this sort we also admit that a lie is unavoidable. But in the second
there is no need for us to tell a lie, first because we can refuse what
is offered by the service of a brother in such a way as to bind
ourselves in no bond of determination, and next because when we once
refuse we can keep our opinion unchanged.
