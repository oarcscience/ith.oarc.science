#### <span id="iv.iii.vii.xii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XII.

<span id="iv.iii.vii.xii-p1"></span>An instance of a lukewarm monk
caught in the snares of covetousness.

<span id="iv.iii.vii.xii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.vii.xii-p2.1"></span>I know</span> of one, who thinks himself
a monk, and what is worse flatters himself on his perfection, who had
been received into a monastery, and when charged by his Abbot not to
turn his thoughts back to those things which he had given up and

<span id="iv.iii.vii.xii-Page_252"></span>when told that if he wished to
be cleansed from his former passions, by which he saw that he was from
time to time grievously oppressed, he should cease from caring about
those things which even formerly were not his own, entangled in the
chains of which he certainly could not make progress towards purifying
himself of his faults: with an angry expression he did not hesitate to
answer, “If you have that with which you can support others, why do you
forbid me to have it as well?” <span id="fr_882"></span>[883](#fn_882)
