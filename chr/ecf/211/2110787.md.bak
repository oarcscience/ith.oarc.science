#### <span id="iv.iv.x.xvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVII.

<span id="iv.iv.x.xvii-p1"></span>How the four kinds of supplication
were originated by the Lord.

<span id="iv.iv.x.xvii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.x.xvii-p2.1"></span>These</span> four kinds of supplication
the Lord Himself by His own example vouchsafed to originate for us, so
that in this too He might fulfil that which was said of Him: “which
Jesus began both to do and to teach.” <span
id="fr_1598"></span>[1599](#fn_1598.md) For He made use of the class of
*supplication* when He said: “Father, if it be possible, let this cup
pass from me;” or this which is chanted in His Person in the Psalm: “My
God, My God, look upon Me, why hast Thou forsaken me,” <span
id="fr_1599"></span>[1600](#fn_1599.md) and others like it. It is *prayer*
where He says: “I have magnified Thee upon the earth, I have finished
the work which Thou gavest Me to do,” and this: “And for their sakes I
sanctify Myself that they also may be sanctified in the truth.” <span
id="fr_1600"></span>[1601](#fn_1600.md) It is *intercession* when He says:
“Father, those Whom Thou hast given me, I will that they also may be
with Me that they may see My glory which Thou hast given Me;” or at any
rate when He says: “Father, forgive them for they know not what they
do.” <span id="fr_1601"></span>[1602](#fn_1601.md) It is *thanksgiving*
when He says: “I confess to Thee, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that
Thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed
them unto babes. Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in Thy sight:”
or at least when He says: “Father, I thank Thee that Thou hast heard Me.
But I knew that Thou hearest Me always.” <span
id="fr_1602"></span>[1603](#fn_1602.md) But though our Lord made a
distinction between these four kinds of prayers as to be offered
separately and one by one according to the scheme which we know of, yet
that they can all be embraced in a perfect prayer at one and the same
time He showed by His own example in that prayer which at the close of
S. John’s gospel we read that He offered up with such fulness. From the
words of which (as it is too long to repeat it all) the careful inquirer
can discover by the order of the passage that this is so. And the
Apostle also in his Epistle to the Philippians has expressed the same
meaning, by putting these four kinds of prayers in a slightly different
order, and has shown that they ought sometimes to be offered together in
the fervour of a single prayer, saying as follows: “But in everything by
prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made
known unto God.” <span id="fr_1603"></span>[1604](#fn_1603.md) And by this
he wanted us especially to understand that in prayer and supplication
thanksgiving ought to be mingled with our requests.
