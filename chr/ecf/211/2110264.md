#### <span id="iii.xxiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXII.

<span id="iii.xxiii-p1"></span>A more particular Exposition of [1 Tim.
vi. 20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#020)<span
id="iii.xxiii-p1.1"></span>.

<span id="iii.xxiii-p2"></span>\[53.\] <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.xxiii-p2.1"></span>But</span> it is worth while to expound the
whole of that passage of the apostle more fully, “O Timothy, keep the
deposit, avoiding profane novelties of words.”

<span id="iii.xxiii-p3"></span>“O!” The exclamation implies
fore-knowledge as well as charity. For he mourned in anticipation over
the errors which he foresaw. Who is the Timothy of to-day, but either
generally the Universal Church, or in particular, the whole body of The
Prelacy, whom it behoves either themselves to possess or to communicate
to others a complete knowledge of religion? What is “Keep the deposit”?
“Keep it,” because of thieves, because of adversaries, lest, while men
sleep, they sow tares over that good wheat which the Son of Man had sown
in his field. “Keep the deposit.” What is “The deposit”? That which has
been intrusted to thee, not that which thou hast thyself devised: a
matter not of wit, but of learning; not of private adoption, but of
public tradition; a matter brought to thee, not put forth by thee,
wherein thou art bound to be not an author but a keeper, not a teacher
but a disciple, not a leader but a follower. “Keep the deposit.”
Preserve the talent of Catholic Faith inviolate, unadulterate. That
which has been intrusted to thee, let it continue in thy possession, let
it be handed on by thee. Thou hast received gold; give gold in turn. Do
not substitute one thing for another. Do not for gold impudently
substitute lead or brass. Give real gold, not counterfeit.

<span id="iii.xxiii-p4"></span>O Timothy! O Priest! O Expositor! O
Doctor! if the divine gift hath qualified thee by wit, by skill, by
learning, be thou a Bazaleel of the spiritual tabernacle, <span
id="fr_499"></span>[500](#fn_499) engrave the precious gems of divine
doctrine, fit them in accurately, adorn them skilfully, add splendor,
grace, beauty. Let that which formerly was believed, though imperfectly
apprehended, as expounded by thee be clearly understood. Let posterity
welcome, understood through thy exposition, what antiquity venerated
without understanding. Yet teach still the same truths which thou hast
learnt, so that though thou speakest after a new fashion, what thou
speakest may not be new.
