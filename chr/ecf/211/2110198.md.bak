#### <span id="ii.vi.ii.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.

<span id="ii.vi.ii.ix-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.vi.ii.ix-p1.1"></span>In</span> the meantime, those Jews, who, as
we have said above, returned into their native land by the permission of
Cyrus, attempted to restore their city and temple. But, being few and
poor, they made but little progress, until, at last, after the lapse of
about a hundred years, while Artaxerxes the king ruled over the
Persians, they were absolutely deterred from building by those who had
local authority. For, at that time, Syria and all Judæa was ruled under
the empire of the Persians by magistrates and governors. Accordingly,
these took counsel to write to king Artaxerxes, that it was not fitting
that opportunity should be granted to the Jews of rebuilding their city,
lest, in accordance with their stubborn character, and being accustomed
to rule over other nations, they should, on recovering their strength,
not submit to live under the sway of a foreign power. Thus, the plan of
the rulers being approved of by the king, the building of the city was
put a stop to, and delayed until the second year of Darius the king.
But, who were kings of Persia throughout this period of time, we shall
here insert, in order that the succession of the dates may be set forth
in a regular and fixed order. Well, then, after Darius the Mede, who, as
we have said above, reigned eighteen years, Cyrus held the supreme power
for thirty-one years. While making war upon the Scythians, he fell in
battle, in the second year after Tarquinius Superbus began to reign at
Rome. To Cyrus succeeded his son Cambyses, and reigned eight years. He,
after harassing with war Egypt and Ethiopia, and subduing these
countries, returned as victor to Persia, but accidentally hurt himself,
and died from that wound. After his death, two brothers, who were magi,
and Medes by nation, held rule over the Persians for seven months. To
slay these, seven of the most noble of the Persians formed a conspiracy,
of whom the leader was Darius, the son of Hystaspes, who was a cousin of
Cyrus, and by unanimous consent the kingdom was bestowed on him: he
reigned thirty and six years. He, four years before his death, fought at
Marathon, in a battle greatly celebrated both in Greek and Roman
history. That took place about the two hundred and sixtieth year after
the founding of Rome, while Macerinus and Augurinus were consuls, that
is, eight hundred and eighty-eight years ago, provided the research I
have made into the succession of Roman consuls does not deceive me; for
I have made the entire reckoning down to the time of Stilico. <span

said to have reigned twenty-one years, although I have found that the
length of his rule is, in most copies, <span
id="fr_338"></span>[339](#fn_338.md) set down at twenty and five years. To
him succeeded Artaxerxes, of whom we have made mention above. Since he
ordered the building of the Jewish city and temple to be stopped, the
work was suspended to the second year of king Darius. But that the
succession of dates may be completed up to him, I have to state that
Artaxerxes reigned forty-one years, Xerxes two months, and that, after
him, Sucdianus ruled for seven months.
