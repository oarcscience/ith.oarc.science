<span id="iv.v.v.xiii"></span>

#### <span id="iv.v.v.xiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIII.

<span id="iv.v.v.xiii-p1"></span>Of the method by which we can remove
the dross from our memory.

<span id="iv.v.v.xiii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.v.xiii-p2.1"></span>Nesteros</span>: From this very fact, from
which there springs up for you the utmost despair of your purification,
a speedy and effectual remedy may arise if only you will transfer to the
reading of and meditation upon the writings of the Spirit, the same
diligence and earnestness which you say that you showed in those secular
studies of yours. For your mind is sure to be taken up with those poems
until it is gaining with the same zeal and assiduity other matters for
it to reflect upon, and is in labour with spiritual and divine things
instead of unprofitable earthly ones. But when these are thoroughly and
entirely conceived and it has been nourished upon them, then by degrees
the former thoughts can be expelled and utterly got rid of. For the mind
of man cannot be emptied of all thoughts, and so as long as it is not
taken up with spiritual interests, is sure to be occupied with what it
learnt long since. For as long as it has nothing to recur to and
exercise itself upon unweariedly, it is sure to fall back upon what it
learnt in childhood, and ever to think about what it took in by long use
and meditation. In order then that this spiritual knowledge may be
strengthened in you with a lasting steadfastness, and that you may not
enjoy it only for a time like those who just touch it not by their own
exertions but at the recital of another, and if I may use the
expression, perceive its scent in the air; but that it may be laid up in
your heart, and deeply noted in it, and thoroughly seen and handled, it
is well for you to use the utmost care in securing that, even if perhaps
you hear things that you know very well produced in the Conference, you
do not regard them in a scornful and disdainful way because you already
know them, but that you lay them to your heart with the same eagerness,
<span id="page_442">p. 442</span> <span
id="iv.v.v.xiii-Page_442"></span>with which the words of salvation which
we are longing for ought to be constantly poured into our ears or should
ever proceed from our lips. For although the narration of holy things be
often repeated, yet in a mind that feels a thirst for true knowledge the
satiety will never create disgust, but as it receives it every day as if
it were something new and what it wanted however often it may have taken
it in, it will so much the more eagerly either hear or speak, and from
the repetition of these things will gain confirmation of the knowledge
it already possesses, rather than weariness of any sort from the
frequent Conference. For it is a sure sign of a mind that is cold and
proud, if it receives with disdain and carelessness the medicine of the
words of salvation, although it be offered with the zeal of excessive
persistence. For “a soul that is full jeers at honeycomb: but to a soul
that is in want even little things appear sweet.” <span
id="fr_1903"></span>[1904](#fn_1903.md) And so if these things have been
carefully taken in and stored up in the recesses of the soul and stamped
with the seal of silence, afterwards like some sweet scented wine that
maketh glad the heart of man, they will, when mellowed by the antiquity
of the thoughts and by long-standing patience, be brought forth from the
jar of your heart with great fragrance, and like some perennial fountain
will flow abundantly from the veins of experience and irrigating
channels of virtue and will pour forth copious streams as if from some
deep well in your heart. For that will happen in your case, which is
spoken in Proverbs to one who has achieved this in his work: “Drink
waters from your own cisterns and from the fount of your own wells. Let
waters from your own fountain flow in abundance for you, but let your
waters pass through into your streets.” <span
id="fr_1904"></span>[1905](#fn_1904.md) And according to the prophet
Isaiah: “Thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a fountain of
water whose waters shall not fail. And the places that have been
desolate for ages shall be built in thee; thou shalt raise up the
foundations of generation and generation; and thou shalt be called the
repairer of the fences, turning the paths into rest.” <span
id="fr_1905"></span>[1906](#fn_1905.md) And that blessedness shall come
upon thee which the same prophet promises: “And the Lord will not cause
thy teacher to flee away from thee any more, and thine eyes shall see
thy teacher. And thine ears shall hear the word of one admonishing thee
behind thy back: This is the way, walk ye in it, and go not aside either
to the right hand or to the left.” <span
id="fr_1906"></span>[1907](#fn_1906.md) And so it will come to pass that
not only every purpose and thought of your heart, but also all the
wanderings and rovings of your imagination will become to you a holy and
unceasing pondering of the Divine law.
