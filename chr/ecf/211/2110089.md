#### <span id="ii.iv.iii.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.

<span id="ii.iv.iii.ix-p1"></span>“<span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.iii.ix-p1.1"></span>I will</span> make use of another not
dissimilar marvel in a like kind of work, having the concurrence of
Refrigerius in doing so. Martin was prepared to throw down a pillar of
immense size, on the top of which an idol stood, but there was no means
by which effect could be given to his design. Well, according to his
usual practice, he betakes himself to prayer. It is undoubted that then
a column, to a certain degree like the other, rushed down from heaven,
and falling upon the idol, it crushed to powder the whole of the
seemingly indestructible mass: this would have been a small matter, had
he only in an invisible way made use of the powers of heaven, but these
very powers were beheld by human eyes serving Martin in a visible
manner.

<span id="ii.iv.iii.ix-p2"></span>“Again, the same Refrigerius is my
witness that a woman, suffering from an issue of blood, when she had
touched the garment of Martin, after the example of the woman mentioned
in the Gospel, was cured in a moment of time.

<span id="ii.iv.iii.ix-p3"></span>“A serpent, cutting its way through a
river, was swimming towards the bank on which we had taken our stand.
‘In the name of the Lord,’ said Martin, ‘I command thee to return.’
Instantly, at the word of the holy man, the venomous beast turned round,
and while we looked on, swam across to the farther bank. As we all
perceived that this had not happened without a miracle; he groaned
deeply, and exclaimed, ‘Serpents hear me, but men will not hear.’
