#### <span id="iv.vi.viii.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.

<span id="iv.vi.viii.vi-p1"></span>A comparison showing how a monk ought
to keep guard over his thoughts.

<span id="iv.vi.viii.vi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.viii.vi-p2.1"></span>Wherefore</span> a monk’s whole attention
should thus be fixed on one point, and the rise and circle of all his
thoughts be vigorously restricted to it; viz., to the recollection of
God, as when a man, who is anxious to raise on high a vault of a round
arch, must constantly draw a line round from its exact centre, and in
accordance with the sure standard it gives discover by the laws of
building all the evenness and roundness required. But if anyone tries to
finish it without ascertaining its centre—though with the utmost
confidence in his art and ability, it is impossible for him to keep the
circumference even, without any error, or to find out simply by looking
at it how much he has taken off by his mistake from the beauty of real
roundness, unless he always has recourse to that test of truth and by
its decision corrects the inner and outer edge of his work, and so
finishes the large and lofty pile to the exact point. <span
id="fr_2304"></span>[2305](#fn_2304.md) So also our mind, unless by working
round the love of the Lord alone as an immovably fixed centre, through
all the circumstances of our works and contrivances, it either fits or
rejects the character of all our thoughts by the excellent compasses, if
I may so say, of love, will never by excellent skill build up the
structure of that spiritual edifice of which Paul is the architect, nor
possess that beautiful house, which the blessed David desired in his
heart to show to the Lord and said: “I have loved the beauty of Thine
house and the place of the dwelling of Thy glory;” <span
id="fr_2305"></span>[2306](#fn_2305.md) but will without foresight raise in
his heart a house that is not beautiful, and that is unworthy of the
Holy Ghost, one that will presently fall, and so will receive no glory
from the reception of the blessed Inhabitant, but will be miserably
destroyed by the fall of his building.
