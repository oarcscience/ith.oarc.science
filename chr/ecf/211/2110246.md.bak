#### <span id="iii.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.

<span id="iii.v-p1"></span>The evil resulting from the bringing in of
Novel Doctrine shown in the instances of the Donatists and Arians.

<span id="iii.v-p2"></span>\[9.\] <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v-p2.1"></span>But</span> that we may make what we say more
intelligible, we must illustrate it by individual examples, and enlarge
upon it somewhat more fully, lest by aiming at too great brevity
important matters be hurried over and lost sight of.

<span id="iii.v-p3"></span>In the time of Donatus, <span
id="fr_429"></span>[430](#fn_429.md) from whom his followers were called
Donatists, when great numbers in Africa were rushing headlong into their
own mad error, and unmindful of their name, their religion, their
profession, were preferring the sacrilegious temerity of one man before
the Church of Christ, then they alone throughout Africa were safe within
the sacred precincts of the Catholic faith, who, detesting the profane
schism, continued in communion with the universal Church, leaving to
posterity an illustrious example, how, and how well in future the
soundness of the whole body should be preferred before the madness of
one, or at most of a few.

<span id="iii.v-p7"></span>\[10.\] So also when the Arian poison had
infected not an insignificant portion of the Church but almost the whole
world, <span id="fr_430"></span>[431](#fn_430.md) so that a sort of
blindness had fallen upon almost all the bishops <span
id="fr_431"></span>[432](#fn_431.md) of the Latin tongue, circumvented
partly by force partly by fraud, and was preventing them from seeing
what was most expedient to be done in the midst of so much confusion,
then whoever was a true lover and worshipper of Christ, preferring the
ancient belief to the novel misbelief, escaped the pestilent infection.

<span id="iii.v-p12"></span>\[11.\] By the peril of which time was
abundantly shown how great a calamity the introduction of a novel
doctrine causes. For then truly not only interests of small account, but
others of the very gravest importance, were subverted. For not only
affinities, relationships, friendships, families, but moreover, cities,
peoples, provinces, nations, at last the whole Roman Empire, were shaken
to their foundation and ruined. For when this same profane Arian
novelty, like a Bellona or a Fury, had first taken captive the
Emperor, <span id="fr_432"></span>[433](#fn_432.md) and had then subjected
all the principal persons of the palace to new laws, from that time it
never ceased to involve everything in confusion, disturbing all things,
public and private, sacred and profane, paying no regard to what was
good and true, but, as though holding a position of authority, smiting
whomsoever it pleased. Then wives were violated, widows ravished,
virgins profaned, monasteries demolished, clergymen ejected, the
inferior clergy scourged, priests driven into exile, jails, prisons,
mines, filled with saints, of whom the greater part, forbidden to enter
into cities, thrust forth from their homes to wander in deserts and
caves, among rocks and the haunts of wild beasts, exposed to nakedness,
hunger, thirst, were worn out and consumed. Of all of which was there
any other cause than that, while <span id="page_134">p. 134</span> <span
id="iii.v-Page_134"></span>human superstitions are being brought in to
supplant heavenly doctrine, while well established antiquity is being
subverted by wicked novelty, while the institutions of former ages are
being set at naught, while the decrees of our fathers are being
rescinded, while the determinations of our ancestors are being torn in
pieces, the lust of profane and novel curiosity refuses to restrict
itself within the most chaste limits of hallowed and uncorrupt
antiquity? <span id="fr_433"></span>[434](#fn_433.md)

<span id="fn_429"></span>[133:430](2110246.htm#fr_429.md) <span
id="iii.v-p3.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v-p4"></span> There were two persons of this name, both
intimately connected with the schism,—the earlier one, bishop of Casa
Nigra in Numidia, the other the successor of Majorinus, whom in the year
311 the party had elected to be bishop of Carthage in opposition to
Cecilian, the Catholic bishop, the ground of the opposition being that
the principal among Cecilian’s consecrators lay under the charge of
having delivered up the sacred books to the heathen magistrates in the
Dioclesian persecution, and of having thereby rendered his ministerial
acts invalid. It was from the last-mentioned probably that the sect was
called.

<span id="iii.v-p5"></span>The Donatists affected great strictness of
life, and ignoring the plain declarations of Scripture, and notably the
prophetic representations contained in our Lord’s parables of the Tares,
the Draw-net, and others, they held that no church could be a true
church which endured the presence of evil men in its society.
Accordingly they broke off communion with the rest of the African Church
and with all who held communion with it, which was in effect the rest of
Christendom, denying the validity of their sacraments, rebaptizing those
who came over to them from other Christian bodies, and reordaining their
clergy.

<span id="iii.v-p6"></span>The sect became so powerful that for some
time it formed the stronger party in the church of North Western Africa,
its bishops exceeding four hundred in number; but partly checked through
the exertions of Augustine in the first years of the fifth century, and
of Pope Gregory the Great at the close of the sixth, and partly weakened
by divisions among themselves, they dwindled away and become extinct.

<span id="fn_430"></span>[133:431](2110246.htm#fr_430.md) <span
id="iii.v-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v-p8"></span> The rise of Arianism was nearly
contemporaneous with that of Donatism. It originated with Arius, a
presbyter of Alexandria, a man of a subtle wit and a fluent tongue. He
began by calling in question the teaching of his bishop, when
discoursing on a certain occasion on the subject of the Trinity. For
himself he denied our blessed Lord’s coeternity and consubstantiality
with the Father, which was in effect to deny that He is God in any true
sense, though he made no scruple of giving Him the name. His doctrine
may be best inferred from the anathema directed against it, appended to
the original Nicene Creed: “Those who say, that once the Son of God did
not exist, and that before He was begotten He did not exist, or who
affirm that He is of a different substance or essence (from that of the
Father), or that His nature is mutable or alterable, those the Catholic
and Apostolic Church anathematises.”

<span id="iii.v-p9"></span>Arianism spread with great rapidity, and
though condemned by the Council of Nicæa in 325, it gained fresh
strength on the death of Constantine and the accession of Constantius,
so that for many years thenceforward the history of the Church is
occupied with nothing so much as with accounts of its struggle for
supremacy.

<span id="iii.v-p10"></span>“Arians and Donatists began both about one
time, which heresies, according to the different strength of their own
sinews, wrought, as the hope of success led them, the one with the
choicest wits, the other with the multitude, so far, that after long and
troublesome experience, the perfectest view that men could take of both
was hardly able to induce any certain determinate resolution, whether
error may do more by the curious subtlety of sharp discourse, or else by
the mere appearance of zeal and devout affection.”—*Hooker*, Eccles.
Pol. v. 62. § 8.

<span id="fn_431"></span>[133:432](2110246.htm#fr_431.md) <span
id="iii.v-p10.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v-p11"></span> The Catholic bishops, in number more than
four hundred, who at Ariminum, in 359, after having subscribed the Creed
of Nicæa, were induced, partly by fraud, partly by threats, to repudiate
its crucial terms and sign an Arian Formulary. It was in reference to
this that St. Jerome wrote, “Ingemuit orbis, et Arium se esse miratus
est.” “The world groaned and marvelled to find itself Arian.” He
continues, “The vessel of the apostles was in extreme danger. The storm
raged, the waves beat upon the ship, all hope was gone. The Lord awakes,
rebukes the tempest, the monster (Constantius) dies, tranquillity is
restored. The bishops who had been thrust out from their sees return,
through the clemency of the new emperor. Then did Egypt receive
Athanasius in triumph, then did the Church of Gaul receive Hilary
returning from battle, then did Italy put off her mourning garments at
the return of Eusebius (of Vercellæ).”—*Advers. Luciferianos*, § 10.

<span id="iii.v-p13"></span> Constantius, the Emperor of the West.

<span id="fn_433"></span>[134:434](2110246.htm#fr_433.md) <span
id="iii.v-p13.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v-p14"></span> Though Vincentius’ account of the Arian
persecutions refers to those under Arian emperors, Constantius and
Valens, the former especially, yet he could not but have had in mind the
atrocious cruelties which were being perpetrated, at the time when he
was writing, by the Arian Vandals in Africa. Possidius, in his life of
St. Augustine, who lay on his death-bed in Hippo while the fierce Vandal
host was encamped round the city (c. xxviii.), gives a detailed account
of them belonging to a date some four years earlier, entirely of a piece
with Vincentius’ description in the text. Victor, bishop of Vite,
himself a sufferer, has left a still ampler relation, *De Persecutione
Vandalorum*.
