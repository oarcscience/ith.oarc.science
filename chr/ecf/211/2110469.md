#### <span id="iv.iii.viii.xxi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXI.

<span id="iv.iii.viii.xxi-p1"></span>Whether we ought to admit the
addition of “without a cause,” in that which is written in the Gospel,
“whosoever is angry with his brother,” etc.

<span id="iv.iii.viii.xxi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.viii.xxi-p2.1"></span>But</span> you should know that in
this, which is found in many copies, “Whosoever is angry with his
brother without a cause, is in danger of the judgment,” <span
id="fr_951"></span>[952](#fn_951.md) the words “without a cause” are
superfluous, and were added by those who did not think that anger for
just causes was to be banished: since certainly nobody, however
unreasonably he is disturbed, would say that he was angry without a
cause. Wherefore it appears to have been added by those who did not
understand the drift of Scripture, which intended altogether to banish
the incentive to anger, and to reserve no occasion whatever for
indignation; lest while we were commanded to be angry with a cause, an
opportunity for being angry without a cause might occur to us. For the
end and aim of patience consists, not in being angry with a good reason,
but in not being angry at all. Although I know that by some this very
expression, “without a cause,” is taken to mean that he is angry without
a cause who when he is angered is not allowed to seek for vengeance. But
it is better so to take it as we find it written in many modern copies
and all the ancient ones.
