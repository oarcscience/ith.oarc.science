#### <span id="iv.iii.iii.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.

<span id="iv.iii.iii.ix-p1"></span>The reason why a Vigil is appointed
as the Sabbath day dawns, and why a dispensation from fasting is enjoyed
on the Sabbath all through the East.

<span id="iv.iii.iii.ix-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.iii.ix-p2.1"></span>And</span> throughout the whole of the
East it has been settled, ever since the time of the preaching of the
Apostles, when the Christian faith and religion was founded, that these
Vigils should be celebrated as the Sabbath dawns, <span
id="fr_748"></span>[749](#fn_748.md) for this reason,—because, when our
Lord and Saviour had been crucified on the sixth day of the week, the
disciples, overwhelmed by the freshness of His sufferings, remained
watching throughout the whole night, giving no rest or sleep to their
eyes. Wherefore, since that time, a service of Vigils has been appointed
for this night, and is still observed in the same way up to the present
day all through the East. And so, after the exertion of the Vigil, a
dispensation from fasting, appointed in like manner for the Sabbath by
apostolic men, <span id="fr_749"></span>[750](#fn_749.md) is not without
reason enjoined in all the churches of the East, in accordance with that
saying of Ecclesiastes, which, although it has another and a mystical
sense, is not misapplied to this, by which we are charged to give to
both days—that is, to the seventh and eighth equally—the same share of
the service, as it says: “Give a portion to these seven and also to
these eight.” <span id="fr_750"></span>[751](#fn_750.md) For this
dispensation from fasting must not be understood as a participation in
the Jewish festival by those above all who are shown to be free from all
Jewish superstition, but as contributing to that rest of the wearied
body of which we have spoken; which, as it fasts continually for five
days in the week all through the year, would easily be worn out and
fail, unless it were revived by an interval of at least two days.

<span id="iv.iii.iii.ix-p3"></span> The observance of a vigil for the
whole or greater part of the night was a regular part of the preparation
for the greater festivals, and as such was usual in the East before the
Sabbath (Saturday) and Lord’s Day, as well as Pentecost and Easter. See
Socrates, H. E. VI. viii., where there is an allusion to this.

<span id="iv.iii.iii.ix-p4"></span> Saturday, as well as Sunday, was
long regarded as a festival in the East, and, indeed, originally in most
churches of the West as well. See the *Apost. Const*. II. lix. 1; VIII.
xxxiii. 1. *Apost. Canons* lxvi.; Council of Laodicæa, Canons xvi.,
xlix., li.
