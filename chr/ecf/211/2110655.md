#### <span id="iv.iv.v.xiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIV.

<span id="iv.iv.v.xiv-p1"></span>Of the incurable depravity of spiritual
wickednesses.

<span id="iv.iv.v.xiv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.v.xiv-p2.1"></span>For</span> a spiritual substance and one
that is not tied to any material flesh has no excuse for an evil thought
which arises within, and also shuts out forgiveness for its sin, because
it is not harassed as we are by incentives of the flesh without, to sin,
but is simply inflamed by the fault of a perverse will. And therefore
its sin is without forgiveness and its weakness without remedy. For as
it falls through the allurements of no earthly matter, so it can find no
pardon or place for repentance. And from this we can clearly gather that
this struggle which arises in us of the flesh and spirit against each
other is not merely harmless, but actually extremely useful to us.
