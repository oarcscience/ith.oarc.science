#### <span id="iv.v.iv.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VIII.

<span id="iv.v.iv.viii-p1"></span>Of the grace of God and the freedom of
the will.

<span id="iv.v.iv.viii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.iv.viii-p2.1"></span>And</span> this care of His and providence
with regard to us the Divine word has finely described by the prophet
Hosea under the figure of Jerusalem as an harlot, and inclining with
disgraceful eagerness to the worship of idols, where when she says: “I
will go after my lovers, who give me my bread, and my water, and my
wool, and my flax, and my oil, and my drink;” the Divine consideration
replies having regard to her salvation and not to her wishes: “Behold I
will hedge up thy way with thorns, and I will stop it up with a wall,
and she shall not find her paths. And she shall follow after her lovers,
and shall not overtake them: and she shall seek them, and shall not find
them, and shall say: I will return to my first husband, because it was
better with me then than now.” <span
id="fr_1761"></span>[1762](#fn_1761) And again our obstinacy, and scorn,
with which we in our rebellious spirit disdain Him when He urges us to a
salutary return, is described in the following comparison: He says: “And
I said thou shalt call Me Father, and shalt not cease to walk after Me.
But as a woman that despiseth her lover, so hath the house of Israel
despised Me, saith the Lord.” <span id="fr_1762"></span>[1763](#fn_1762)
Aptly then, as He has compared Jerusalem to an adulteress forsaking her
husband, He compares His own love and persevering goodness to a man who
is dying of love for a woman. For the goodness and love of God, which He
ever shows to mankind,—since it is overcome by no injuries so as to
cease from caring for our salvation, or be driven from His first
intention, as if vanquished by our iniquities,—could not be more fitly
described by any comparison than the case of a man inflamed with most
ardent love for a woman, who is consumed by a more burning passion for
her, the more he sees that he is slighted and despised by her. The
Divine protection then is inseparably present with us, and so great is
the kindness of the Creator towards His creatures, that His Providence
not only accompanies it, but actually constantly precedes it, as the
prophet experienced and plainly confessed, saying: “My God will prevent
me with His mercy.” <span id="fr_1763"></span>[1764](#fn_1763) And when
He sees in us some beginnings of a good will, He at once enlightens it
and strengthens it and urges it on towards salvation, increasing that
which He Himself implanted or which He sees to have arisen from our own
efforts. For He says “Before they cry, I will hear them: While they are
still speaking I will hear them;” and again: “As soon as He hears the
voice of thy crying, He will answer thee.” <span
id="fr_1764"></span>[1765](#fn_1764) And in His goodness, not only does
He inspire us with holy desires, but actually creates occasions for life
and opportunities for good results, and shows to those in error the
direction of the way of salvation.
