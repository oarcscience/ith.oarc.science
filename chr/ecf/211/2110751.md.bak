#### <span id="iv.iv.ix.vii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.

<span id="iv.iv.ix.vii-p1"></span>Of the origin of principalities or
powers.

<span id="iv.iv.ix.vii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.ix.vii-p2.1"></span>None</span> of the faithful question the
fact that before the formation of this visible creation God made
spiritual and celestial powers, in order that owing to the very fact
that they knew that they had been formed out of nothing by the goodness
of the Creator for such glory and bliss, they might render to Him
continual thanks and ceaselessly continue to praise Him. For neither
should we imagine that God for the first time began to originate His
creation and work with the formation of this world, as if in those
countless ages beforehand He had taken no thought of Providence and the
divine ordering of things, and as if we could believe that having none
towards whom to show the blessings of His goodness, He had been
solitary, and a stranger to all bountifulness; a thing which is too poor
and unsuitable to fancy of that boundless and eternal and
incomprehensible Majesty; as the Lord Himself says of these powers:
“When the stars were made together, all my angels praised Me with a loud
voice.” <span id="fr_1526"></span>[1527](#fn_1526.md) Those then who were
present at the creation of the stars, are most clearly proved to have
been created before that “beginning” in which it is said that heaven and
earth were made, inasmuch as they are said with loud voices and
admiration to have praised the Creator because of all those visible
creatures which, as they saw, <span id="page_378">p. 378</span> <span
id="iv.iv.ix.vii-Page_378"></span>proceeded forth from nothing. Before
then that beginning in time which is spoken of by Moses, and which
according to the historic and Jewish interpretation denotes the age of
this world (without prejudice to *our* interpretation, according to
which we explain that the “beginning,” of all things is Christ, in whom
the Father created all things, as it is said “All things were made by
him, and without Him was not anything made,”) <span
id="fr_1527"></span>[1528](#fn_1527.md) before, I say, that beginning of
Genesis in time there is no question that God had already created all
those powers and heavenly virtues; which the Apostle enumerates in order
and thus describes: “For in Christ were created all things both in
heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether they be angels or
archangels, whether they be thrones or dominions, whether they be
principalities or powers. All things were made by Him and in Him.” <span
