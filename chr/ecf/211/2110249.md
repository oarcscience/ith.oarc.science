#### <span id="iii.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.

<span id="iii.viii-p1"></span>How Heretics, craftily cite obscure
passages in ancient writers in support of their own novelties.

<span id="iii.viii-p2"></span>\[19.\] <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.viii-p2.1"></span>This</span> condemnation, indeed, <span
id="fr_442"></span>[443](#fn_442) seems to have been providentially
promulgated as though with a special view to the fraud of those who,
contriving to dress up a heresy under a name other than its own, get
hold often of the works of some ancient writer, not very clearly
expressed, which, owing to the very obscurity of their own doctrine,
have the appearance of agreeing with it, so that they get the credit of
being neither the first nor the only persons who have held it. This
wickedness of theirs, in my judgment, is doubly hateful: first, because
they are not afraid to invite others to drink of the poison of heresy;
and secondly, because with profane breath, as though fanning smouldering
embers into flame, they blow upon the memory of each holy man, and
spread an evil report of what ought to be buried in silence by bringing
it again under notice, thus treading in the footsteps of their father
Ham, who not only forebore to cover the nakedness of the venerable Noah,
but told it to the others that they might laugh at it, offending thereby
so grievously against the duty of filial piety, that even his
descendants were involved with him in the curse which he drew down,
widely differing from those blessed brothers of his, who would neither
pollute their own eyes by looking upon the nakedness of their revered
father, nor would suffer others to do so, but went backwards, as the
Scripture says, and covered him, that is, they neither approved nor
betrayed the fault of the holy man, for which cause they were rewarded
with a benediction on themselves and their posterity. <span
id="fr_443"></span>[444](#fn_443)

<span id="iii.viii-p5"></span>\[20.\] But to return to the matter in
hand: It behoves us then to have a great dread of the crime of
perverting the faith and adulterating religion, a crime from which we
are deterred not only by the Church’s discipline, but also by the
censure of apostolical authority. For every one knows how gravely, how
severely, how vehemently, the blessed apostle Paul inveighs against
certain, who, with marvellous levity, had “been so soon removed from him
who had called them to the grace of Christ to another Gospel, which was
not another;” <span id="fr_444"></span>[445](#fn_444) “who had heaped to
themselves teachers after their own lusts, turning away their ears from
the truth, and being turned aside unto fables;” <span
id="fr_445"></span>[446](#fn_445) “having damnation because they had
cast off their first faith;” <span id="fr_446"></span>[447](#fn_446) who
had been deceived by those of whom the same apostle writes to the Roman
Christians, “Now, I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause
divisions and offences, contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned,
and avoid them. For they that are such serve not the Lord Christ, but
their own belly, and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts
of the simple,” <span id="fr_447"></span>[448](#fn_447) “who enter into
houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with
diverse lusts, ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of
the truth;” <span id="fr_448"></span>[449](#fn_448) “vain talkers and
deceivers, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought
not, for filthy lucre’s sake;” <span id="fr_449"></span>[450](#fn_449)
“men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith;” <span
id="fr_450"></span>[451](#fn_450) “proud knowing nothing, but doting
about questions and strifes of words, destitute of the truth, supposing
that godliness is gain,” <span id="fr_451"></span>[452](#fn_451) “withal
learning to be idle, wandering about from house to house, and not only
idle, but tattlers also and busy-bodies, speaking things which they
ought not,” <span id="fr_452"></span>[453](#fn_452) “who having put away
a good conscience have made shipwreck concerning the faith;” <span
id="fr_453"></span>[454](#fn_453) “whose profane and vain babblings
increase unto more ungodliness, and their word doth eat as doth a
cancer.” <span id="fr_454"></span>[455](#fn_454) Well, also, is it
written of them: “But they shall proceed no further: for their folly
shall be manifest unto all men, as theirs also was.” <span
id="fr_455"></span>[456](#fn_455)
