#### <span id="iv.iv.v.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.

<span id="iv.iv.v.iii-p1"></span>His answer to the question raised.

<span id="iv.iv.v.iii-p2"></span>A <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.v.iii-p2.1"></span>threefold</span> account of this mental
dryness of which you speak has been given by the Elders. For it comes
either from carelessness on our part, or from the assaults of the devil,
or from the permission and allowance of the Lord. From carelessness on
our part, when through our own faults, coldness has come upon us, and we
have behaved carelessly and hastily, and owing to slothful idleness have
fed on bad thoughts, and so make the ground of our heart bring forth
thorns and thistles; which spring up in it, and consequently make us
sterile, and powerless as regards all spiritual fruit and meditation.
From the assaults of the devil when, sometimes, while we are actually
intent on good desires, our enemy with crafty subtilty makes his way
into our heart, and without our knowledge and against our will we are
drawn away from the best intentions.
