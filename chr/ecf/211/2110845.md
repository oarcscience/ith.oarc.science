#### <span id="iv.v.iv.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.

<span id="iv.v.iv.iv-p1"></span>An objection, asking how the Gentiles
can be said to have chastity without the grace of God.

<span id="iv.v.iv.iv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.iv.iv-p2.1"></span>Germanus</span>: To this explanation, the
excellence of which we cannot hastily disprove, it seems a difficulty
that it tends to destroy free will. For as we see that many of the
heathen to whom the assistance of Divine grace has certainly not been
vouchsafed, are eminent not only in the virtues of frugality and
patience, but (which is more remarkable) in that of chastity, how can we
think that the freedom of their will is taken captive and that these
virtues are granted to them by God’s gift, especially as in following
after the wisdom of this world, and in their utter ignorance not only of
God’s grace but even of the existence of the true God, as we have known
Him by the course of our reading and the teaching of others—they are
said to have gained the most perfect purity of chastity by their own
efforts and exertions.
