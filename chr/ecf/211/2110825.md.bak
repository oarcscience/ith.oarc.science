#### <span id="iv.v.ii.i-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.

<span id="iv.v.ii.i-p1"></span>Description of the town of Thennesus.

<span id="iv.v.ii.i-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.ii.i-p2.1"></span>When</span> we were living in a monastery in
Syria after our first infancy in the faith, and when after we had grown
somewhat we had begun to long for some greater grace of perfection, we
determined straightway to seek Egypt and penetrating even to the
remotest desert of the Thebaid, <span
id="fr_1684"></span>[1685](#fn_1684.md) to visit very many of the saints,
whose glory and fame had spread abroad everywhere, with the wish if not
to emulate them at any rate to know them. And so we came by a very
lengthy voyage to a town of Egypt named Thennesus, <span
id="fr_1685"></span>[1686](#fn_1685.md) whose inhabitants are so surrounded
either by the sea or by salt lakes that they devote themselves to
business alone and get their wealth and substance by naval commerce as
the land fails them, so that indeed when they want to build houses,
there is no soil sufficient for this, unless it is brought by boat from
a distance.

<span id="iv.v.ii.i-p3"></span> It is very doubtful whether Cassian ever
carried out the intention, of which he here speaks, of visiting the
Thebaid. So far as we can trace the course of his wanderings, he does
not seem to have penetrated farther into Egypt than the desert of Scete.

<span id="iv.v.ii.i-p4"></span> Thennesus, a town at the Tanitic mouth
of the Nile near Lake Menzaleh. For the description of the neighbouring
country compare Conference VII. c. xxvi.
