#### <span id="iv.vi.v.xiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIII.

<span id="iv.vi.v.xiii-p1"></span>What kind of good fasting is.

<span id="iv.vi.v.xiii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.v.xiii-p2.1"></span>Wherefore</span> we must now inquire what
we ought to hold about the state of fasting, whether we meant that it
was good in the same sort of way as justice, prudence, fortitude and
temperance, which cannot possibly be made anything else, or whether it
is something indifferent which sometimes is useful when done, and may be
sometimes omitted without condemnation; and which sometimes it is wrong
to do, and sometimes laudable to omit. For if we hold fasting to be
included in that list of virtues, so that abstinence from food is placed
among those things which are good in themselves, then certainly the
partaking of food will be bad and wrong. For whatever is the opposite of
that which is in its own nature good, must certainly be held to be in
its own nature bad. But this the authority of Holy Scripture does not
allow to us to lay down. For if we fast with such thoughts and
intentions, so as to think that we fall into sin by taking food, we
shall not only gain no advantage by our abstinence but shall actually
contract grievous guilt and fall into the sin of impiety, as the Apostle
says: “Abstaining from meats which God has created to be received with
thanksgiving by the faithful and those who know the truth. For every
creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused if it is partaken of
with thanksgiving.” For “if a man thinks that a thing is common, to him
it is common.” <span id="fr_2187"></span>[2188](#fn_2187) And therefore
we never read that anyone is condemned simply for taking food, but only
when something was joined with it or followed afterwards, for which he
deserved condemnation.
