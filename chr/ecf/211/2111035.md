#### <span id="iv.vi.v.xxxv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXV.

<span id="iv.vi.v.xxxv-p1"></span>A question, why sometimes when we are
fasting more strictly than usual, we are troubled by carnal desires more
keenly than usual.

<span id="iv.vi.v.xxxv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.v.xxxv-p2.1"></span>Germanus</span>: You have very clearly
explained a most difficult question, and one which, as we think, is
unknown to many. Wherefore we pray you to add this also for our good,
and carefully to expound why sometimes when we are fasting more strictly
than usual, and are exhausted and worn out, severer bodily struggles are
excited. For often on waking from sleep, when we have discovered that we
have been defiled <span id="fr_2226"></span>[2227](#fn_2226) we are so
dejected in heart that we do not even venture faithfully to rise even
for prayer.
