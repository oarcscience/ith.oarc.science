#### <span id="iv.iv.viii.xxx-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXX.

<span id="iv.iv.viii.xxx-p1"></span>The answer to the question raised.

<span id="iv.iv.viii.xxx-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.viii.xxx-p2.1"></span>Serenus</span>: If we had this
knowledge, or rather faith, of which I treated above; viz., to believe
that all things were brought about by God, and ordered for the good of
our souls, we should not only never despise them, but rather pray
without ceasing for them as our own members, and sympathize with them
with all our hearts and the fullest affection (for “when one member
suffers, all the members suffer with it” <span
id="fr_1498"></span>[1499](#fn_1498) ), as we know that we cannot
possibly be perfected without them inasmuch as they are members of us,
just as we read that our predecessors could not attain the fulness of
promise without us, as the Apostle speaks of them as follows: “And these
all being approved by the testimony of faith, received not the promise,
God providing some better thing for us that they should not be perfected
without us.” <span id="fr_1499"></span>[1500](#fn_1499) But we never
remember that holy communion was forbidden them; nay rather if it were
possible, they thought that it ought to be given to them *daily*; nor
indeed according to the words of the gospel which you incongruously
apply in this sense “Give not that which is holy to dogs,” <span
id="fr_1500"></span>[1501](#fn_1500) ought we to believe that holy
communion becomes food for the demon, and not a purification and
safeguard of body and soul; for when it is received by a man it, so to
speak, burns out and puts to flight the spirit which has its seat in his
members or is trying to lurk in them. For in this way we have lately
seen Abbot Andronicus and many others cured. For the enemy will more and
more abuse the man who is possessed, if he sees him cut off from the
heavenly medicine, and will tempt him more often and more fearfully, as
he sees him removed the further from this spiritual remedy. <span

<span id="iv.iv.viii.xxx-p6"></span> The question whether the Holy
Communion should ever be given to those possessed is discussed by S.
Thomas Aquinas, in the Summa III. Q. lxxx. Art. 9, and answered in the
affirmative, the authorities quoted in its favour being this passage
from Cassian, and the third Canon of the 1st Council of Orange (<span
