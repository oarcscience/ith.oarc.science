#### <span id="iv.vii.iii.i-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.

<span id="iv.vii.iii.i-p1"></span>How the errors of later heretics have
been condemned and refuted in the persons of their authors and
originators.

<span id="iv.vii.iii.i-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.iii.i-p2.1"></span>As</span> we began by setting down in the
first book some things by which we showed that our new heretic is but an
offshoot from ancient stocks of heresy, the due condemnation of the
earlier heretics ought to be enough to secure a sentence of due
condemnation for him. For as he has the same roots and grows up out of
the same fallow <span id="fr_2384"></span>[2385](#fn_2384) he has
already been amply condemned in the persons of his predecessors,
especially as those who went wrong immediately before these men very
properly condemned the very thing which these men are now
asserting, <span id="fr_2385"></span>[2386](#fn_2385) so that the
examples of their own party ought to be amply sufficient for them in
both directions; viz., that of those who were restored and that of those
who were condemned. For if they are capable of amendment they have their
remedy set forth in the correction of their own party. If they are
incapable of it they receive their sentence in the condemnation <span
id="page_556">p. 556</span> <span id="iv.vii.iii.i-Page_556"></span>of
their own folk. But that we may not be thought to have prejudged the
case against them instead of fairly judging it, we will produce their
actual pestilent assertions, or rather I should say their blasphemous
folly: taking “above all the shield of faith, and the sword of the
Spirit which is the Word of God,” <span
id="fr_2386"></span>[2387](#fn_2386) that when the head of the old
serpent rises once more, the same sword of the Divine Word which
formerly severed it in the case of those ancient dragons may even now
cut it off in the persons of these new serpents. For since the error of
these is the same as that of those former ones, the decapitation of
those ought to be counted as the decapitation of these; and as the
serpents revive and emit pestilent blasts against the Lord’s church, and
cause some to fail through their hissing, we must on account of these
new diseases add a fresh remedy to those older cures, so that even if
what has already been done prove insufficient to heal <span
id="fr_2387"></span>[2388](#fn_2387) the malady, what we are now doing
may be adequate to restore those who are suffering from it.

<span id="iv.vii.iii.i-p4"></span> The allusion is to the recantation of
Leporius and his companions. They were the immediate predecessors of
Nestorius, and Cassian means to say that their recantation of their
error ought to have been an example for Nestorius to follow.
