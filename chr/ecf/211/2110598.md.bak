#### <span id="iv.iv.iii.vii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.vii-p1"></span>Of an illusion into which another
fell for lack of discretion.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.vii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.iii.vii-p2.1"></span>Why</span> also should I speak of one
(whose name we had rather not mention as he is still alive), who for a
long while received a devil in the brightness of an angelic form, and
was often deceived by countless revelations from him and believed that
he was a messenger of righteousness: for when these were granted, every
night he provided a light in his cell without the need of any lamp. At
last he was ordered by the devil to offer up to God his own son who was
living with him in the monastery, in order that his merits might by this
sacrifice be made equal to those of the patriarch Abraham. And he was so
far seduced by his persuasion that he would really have committed the
murder unless his son had seen him getting ready the knife and
sharpening it with unusual care, and looking for the chains with which
he meant to tie him up for the sacrifice when he was going to offer him
up; and had fled away in terror with a presentiment of the coming crime.
