part of his instruction—through which the juniors brought to him may be
able in due course to mount to the greatest heights of perfection—will
be to teach him first to conquer his own wishes; and, anxiously and
diligently practising him in this, he will of set purpose contrive to
give him such orders as he knows to be contrary to his liking; for,
taught by many examples, they say that a monk, and especially the
younger ones, cannot bridle the desire of his concupiscence unless he
has first learnt by obedience to mortify his wishes. And so they lay it
down that the man who has not first learnt to overcome his desires
cannot possibly stamp out anger or sulkiness, or the spirit of
fornication; nor can he preserve true humility of heart, or lasting
unity with the brethren, or a stable and continuous concord; nor remain
for any length of time in the monastery.
