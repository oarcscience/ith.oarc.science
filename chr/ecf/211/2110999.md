#### <span id="iv.vi.iv.xii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XII.

<span id="iv.vi.iv.xii-p1"></span>Wherein we must do penance for a time
only; and wherein it can have no end.

<span id="iv.vi.iv.xii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.xii-p2.1"></span>But</span> that description of the
forgetfulness spoken of only has to do with capital offences, which are
also condemned by the mosaic law, the inclination to which is destroyed
and put an end to by a good life, and so also the penance for them has
an end. But for those small offences in which, as it is written, “the
righteous falls seven times and will rise again” <span
id="fr_2152"></span>[2153](#fn_2152) penitence will never cease. For
either through ignorance, or forgetfulness, or thought, or word, or
surprise, or necessity, or weakness of the flesh, or defilement in a
dream, we often fall every day either against our will or voluntarily;
offences for which David also prays the Lord, and asks for purification
and pardon, and says: “Who can understand sins? from my secret ones
cleanse me; and from those of others spare Thy servant;” <span
id="fr_2153"></span>[2154](#fn_2153) and the Apostle: “For the good
which I would I do not, and the evil which I would not, that I do.” For
which also the same man exclaims with a sigh “O wretched man that I am!
who shall deliver me from the body of this death?” <span
id="fr_2154"></span>[2155](#fn_2154) For we slip into these so easily as
it were by a law of nature, that however carefully and guardedly we are
on the lookout against them, we cannot altogether avoid them. Since it
was of these that one of the disciples, whom Jesus loved, declared and
laid down absolutely saying: “If we say that we have no sin we deceive
ourselves, and His word is not in us.” <span
id="fr_2155"></span>[2156](#fn_2155) Further for a man who is anxious to
reach the heights of perfection it will not greatly help him to have
arrived at the end of penitence, i.e., to restrain himself from unlawful
acts, unless he has always urged himself forward in unwearied course to
those virtues whereby we come to the signs of satisfaction. For it will
not be enough for a man to have kept himself clear from those foul
stains of sins which the Lord hates, unless he has also secured by
purity of heart and perfect Apostolical love that sweet fragrance of
virtue in which the Lord delights. Thus far Abbot Pinufius discoursed on
the marks of satisfaction and the end of penitence. And although he
pressed us with anxious love to decide to stay in his Cœnobium, yet when
he could not retain us, as we were incited by the fame of the desert of
Scete, he sent us on our way.
