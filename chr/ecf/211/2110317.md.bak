#### <span id="iv.iii.iii.i-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.

<span id="iv.iii.iii.i-p1"></span>Of the services of the third, sixth,
and ninth hours, which are observed in the regions of Syria.

<span id="iv.iii.iii.i-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.iii.i-p2.1"></span>The</span> nocturnal system of prayers and
Psalms as observed throughout Egypt has been, I think, by God’s help,
explained so far as our slender ability was able; and now we must speak
of the services of Tierce, Sext, and None, according to the rule of the
monasteries of Palestine and Mesopotamia, <span
id="fr_715"></span>[716](#fn_715.md) as we said in the Preface, and must
moderate by the customs of these the perfection and inimitable rigour of
the discipline of the Egyptians.

<span id="iv.iii.iii.i-p3"></span> According to S. Jerome, Hilarion was
the first to introduce the monastic life into Palestine (*Vita Hilar*.).
His work was carried on by his companion and pupil Hesycas and
Epiphanius, afterwards Bishop of Salamis in Cyprus. In Asia Minor S.
Basil was the greater organizer of monasticism, though, as he tells us,
there were already many monks, not only in Egypt but also in Palestine,
Cœlosyria, and Mesopotamia (Ep. ccxxiii.<span
id="iv.iii.iii.i-p3.1"></span>). See also on the early monks of
Palestine and the East, Sozomen, H. E., Book VI., cc. xxxii.–xxxv.

long to prayer and Psalm continually, with the addition of work, without
distinction of hours.](2110318.md)
