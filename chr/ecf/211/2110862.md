#### <span id="iv.v.v.ii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.

<span id="iv.v.v.ii-p1"></span>On grasping the knowledge of spiritual
things.

<span id="iv.v.v.ii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.v.ii-p2.1"></span>Whoever</span> then would arrive at this
theoretical knowledge must first pursue practical knowledge with all his
might and main. For this practical knowledge can be acquired without
theoretical, but theoretical cannot possibly be gained without
practical. For there are certain stages, so distinct, and arranged in
such a way that man’s humility may be able to mount on high; and if
these follow each other in turn in the order of which we have spoken,
man can attain to a height to which he could not fly, if the first step
were wanting. In vain then does one strive for the vision of God, who
does not shun the stains of sins: “For the spirit of God hates
deception, and dwells not in a body subject to sins.” <span
