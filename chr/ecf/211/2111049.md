#### <span id="iv.vi.vii.xi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XI.

<span id="iv.vi.vii.xi-p1"></span>Explanation of the phrase: “For I
delight in the law of God after the inner man,” etc.

<span id="iv.vi.vii.xi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.vii.xi-p2.1"></span>And</span> they “delight” indeed “in the
law of God after the inner man,” which soars above all visible things
and ever strives to be united to God alone, but they “see another law in
their members,” i.e., implanted in their natural human condition, which
“resisting the law of their mind,” <span
id="fr_2265"></span>[2266](#fn_2265.md) brings their thoughts into
captivity to the forcible law of sin, compelling them to forsake that
chief good and submit to earthly notions, which though they may appear
necessary and useful when they are taken up in the interests of some
religious want, yet when they are set against that good which fascinates
the gaze of all the saints, are seen by them to be bad and such as
should be avoided, because by them in some way or other and for a short
time they are drawn away from the joy of that perfect bliss. For the law
of sin is really what the fall of its first father brought on mankind by
that fault of his, against which there was uttered this sentence by the
most just Judge: “Cursed is the ground in thy works; thorns and thistles
shall it bring forth to thee, and in the sweat of thy brow shalt thou
eat bread.” <span id="fr_2266"></span>[2267](#fn_2266.md) This, I say, is
the law, implanted in the members of all mortals, which resists the law
of our mind and keeps it back from the vision of God, and which, as the
earth is cursed in our works after the knowledge of good and evil,
begins to produce the thorns and thistles of thoughts, by the sharp
pricks of which the natural seeds of virtues are choked, so that without
the sweat of our brow we cannot eat our bread which “cometh down from
heaven,” and which “strengtheneth man’s heart.” <span
id="fr_2267"></span>[2268](#fn_2267.md) The whole human race in general
therefore is without exception subject to this law. For there is no one,
however saintly, who does not take the <span id="page_526">p. 526</span>
<span id="iv.vi.vii.xi-Page_526"></span>bread mentioned above with the
sweat of his brow and anxious efforts of his heart. But many rich men,
as we see, are fed on that common bread without any sweat of their brow.
