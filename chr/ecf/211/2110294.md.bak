#### <span id="iv.iii.i.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.

<span id="iv.iii.i.ix-p1"></span>Of their Shoes.

<span id="iv.iii.i.ix-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.i.ix-p2.1"></span>But</span> refusing shoes, as forbidden by
the command of the gospel, if bodily weakness or the morning cold in
winter or the scorching heat of midday compels them, they merely protect
their feet with sandals, explaining that by the use of them and the
Lord’s permission it is implied that if, while we are still in this
world we cannot be completely set free from care and anxiety about the
flesh, nor can we be altogether released from it, we should at least
provide for the wants of the body with as little fuss and as slight an
entanglement as possible: and as for the feet of our soul which ought to
be ready for our spiritual race and always prepared for preaching the
peace of the gospel (with which feet we run after the odour of the
ointments of Christ, and of which David says: “I ran in thirst,” and
Jeremiah: “But I am not troubled, following Thee”), <span
id="fr_661"></span>[662](#fn_661.md) we ought not to suffer them to be
entangled in the deadly cares of this world, filling our thoughts with
those things which concern not the supply of the wants of nature, but
unnecessary and harmful pleasures. And this we shall thus fulfil if, as
the Apostle advises, we “make not provision for the flesh with its
lusts.” <span id="fr_662"></span>[663](#fn_662.md) But though lawfully
enough they make use of these sandals, as permitted by the Lord’s
command, yet they never suffer them to remain on their feet when they
approach to celebrate or to receive the holy mysteries, as they think
that they ought to observe in the letter that which was said to Moses
and to Joshua, the son of Nun: “Loose the latchet of thy shoe: for the
place whereon thou standest is holy ground.” <span
