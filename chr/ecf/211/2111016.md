#### <span id="iv.vi.v.xvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVI.

<span id="iv.vi.v.xvi-p1"></span>How what is good in its own nature can
be distinguished from other things that are good.

<span id="iv.vi.v.xvi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.v.xvi-p2.1"></span>And</span> this may be distinguished from
those other things which we have termed indifferent, in these ways: if a
thing is good in itself and not by reason of something else: if it is
useful for its own sake, and not for the sake of something else: if it
is unchangeably and at all times good, and always keeps its character
and can never become anything different: if its removal or cessation
cannot fail to produce the greatest harm: if that which is its opposite
is in the same way evil in its own nature, and can never be turned into
anything good. And these descriptions by which the nature of things that
are good in themselves can be distinguished, cannot possibly be applied
to fasting, for it is not good of itself, nor useful for its own sake
because it is wisely used for the acquisition of purity of heart and
body, that the pricks of the flesh being dulled the soul may be pacified
and reconciled to its Creator, nor is it unchangeably and at all times
good, because often we are not injured by its intermission, and indeed
sometimes if it is unreasonably practised it becomes injurious. Nor is
that which seems its opposite evil in its own nature, i.e., the
partaking of food, which is naturally agreeable, which cannot be
regarded as evil, unless intemperance and luxury or some other faults
are the result; “For not that which entereth into the mouth, defileth a
man, but that which cometh out of the mouth, that defileth a man.” <span
id="fr_2190"></span>[2191](#fn_2190) And so a man disparages what is
good in its own nature, and does not treat it properly or without sin,
if he does it not for its own sake but for the sake of something else,
for everything else should be done for the sake of it, but it should be
sought for its own sake alone.
