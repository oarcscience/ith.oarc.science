#### <span id="iv.vi.viii.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.

<span id="iv.vi.viii.iii-p1"></span>Of the character of the districts
which anchorites ought to seek.

<span id="iv.vi.viii.iii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.viii.iii-p2.1"></span>And</span> therefore by him who is
exercising anxious care over the purity of his inner man, those
districts should be sought, which do not by their fruitfulness and
fertility invite his mind to the trouble of cultivating them, nor drive
him forth from his fixed and immovable position in his cell, and force
him to go forth to some work in the open air, and so, his thoughts being
as it were poured forth openly, scatter to the winds all his
concentration of mind and all the keenness of his vision of his aim. And
this cannot be guarded against or seen by anyone at all however careful
and watchful, except one who continually keeps his body and soul shut up
and enclosed in walls, that, like a splendid fisherman, looking out for
food for himself by the apostolic art, he may eagerly and without moving
catch the swarms of thoughts swimming in the calm depths of his heart,
and surveying with curious eye the depths as from a high rock, may
sagaciously and cunningly decide what he ought to lure to himself by his
saving hook, and what he can neglect and reject as bad and nasty fishes.
