#### <span id="iv.vii.viii.xxiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXIII.

<span id="iv.vii.viii.xxiii-p1"></span>He continues the same argument to
show that Christ had no need of another’s glory as He had a glory of His
own.

<span id="iv.vii.viii.xxiii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.viii.xxiii-p2.1"></span>But</span> to end let us see the
addition with which you sum up your preceding blasphemies. Your words
are, “Who gave such <span id="fr_2656"></span>[2657](#fn_2656.md) glory to
Christ?” You name glory in order to degrade Him. For by the assertion
that the Lord was endowed with glory, in saying that He received it you
blasphemously imply that He stood in need of it. For your perverse
notion suggests that the generosity of the giver shows the need of the
receiver. O miserable impiety of yours! and where is that which Divinity
itself once foretold of the Lord Jesus Christ ascending into heaven?
Saying: “Lift up your heads, and the King of glory <span
id="page_617">p. 617</span> <span
id="iv.vii.viii.xxiii-Page_617"></span>shall come in.” <span
id="fr_2657"></span>[2658](#fn_2657.md) And when He (after the fashion of
Divine utterances) had made answer to Himself as if in the character of
an inquirer: “Who is the King of glory?” at once He adds: “The Lord
strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle:” showing under the figure
of a battle fought, the victory of the Lord in His triumph. Then when,
to complete the exposition of it, He had repeated the words of the
utterance quoted above, He showed by the following conclusion the
majesty of the Lord as He entered heaven, saying “The Lord of hosts, He
is the King of glory.” On purpose that the fact of His taking a body
might not interfere with the glory of His mighty Divinity, He taught
that the same Person was Lord of hosts and King of heavenly glory, whom
He had previously proclaimed Victor in the battle below. Go now <span
id="fr_2658"></span>[2659](#fn_2658.md) and say that the glory was given to
the Lord, when both prophecy has said that He was the King of glory, and
He Himself also has testified of Himself as follows: “When the Son of
man shall come in His glory.” <span id="fr_2659"></span>[2660](#fn_2659.md)
Refute it, if you can, and contradict this; viz., that whereas He
testifies that He has glory of His own, you say that He has received
Another’s. Although we maintain that He has His own glory, in such a way
that we do not deny that His very property of glory is common to Him
with the Father and the Holy Ghost. For whatever God possesses belongs
to the Godhead: and the kingdom of glory belongs to the Son of God in
such a way that it is not kept back from belonging to the entire
Godhead.
