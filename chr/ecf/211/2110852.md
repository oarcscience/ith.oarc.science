#### <span id="iv.v.iv.xi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XI.

<span id="iv.v.iv.xi-p1"></span>Whether the grace of God precedes or
follows our good will.

<span id="iv.v.iv.xi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.iv.xi-p2.1"></span>And</span> so these are somehow mixed up and
indiscriminately confused, so that among many persons, which depends on
the other is involved in great questionings, i.e., does God have
compassion upon us because we have shown the beginning of a good will,
or does the beginning of a good will follow because God has had
compassion upon us? For many believing each of these and asserting them
more widely than is right are entangled in all kinds of opposite errors.
For if we say that the beginning of free will is in our own power, what
<span id="page_428">p. 428</span> <span
id="iv.v.iv.xi-Page_428"></span>about Paul the persecutor, what about
Matthew the publican, of whom the one was drawn to salvation while eager
for bloodshed and the punishment of the innocent, the other for violence
and rapine? But if we say that the beginning of our free will is always
due to the inspiration of the grace of God, what about the faith of
Zaccheus, or what are we to say of the goodness of the thief on the
cross, who by their own desires brought violence to bear on the kingdom
of heaven and so prevented the special leadings of their vocation? But
if we attribute the performance of virtuous acts, and the execution of
God’s commands to our own will, how do we pray: “Strengthen, O God, what
Thou hast wrought in us;” and “The work of our hands stablish Thou upon
us?” <span id="fr_1799"></span>[1800](#fn_1799) We know that Balaam was
brought to curse Israel, but we see that when he wished to curse he was
not permitted to. Abimelech is preserved from touching Rebecca and so
sinning against God. Joseph is sold by the envy of his brethren, in
order to bring about the descent of the children of Israel into Egypt,
and that while they were contemplating the death of their brother
provision might be made for them against the famine to come: as Joseph
shows when he makes himself known to his brethren and says: “Fear not,
neither let it be grievous unto you that ye sold me into these parts:
for for your salvation God sent me before you;” and below: “For God sent
me before that ye might be preserved upon the earth and might have food
whereby to live. Not by your design was I sent but by the will of God,
who has made me a father to Pharaoh and lord of all his house, and chief
over all the land of Egypt.” And when his brethren were alarmed after
the death of his father, he removed their suspicions and terror by
saying: “Fear not: Can ye resist the will of God? You imagined evil
against me but God turned it into good, that He might exalt me, as ye
see at the present time, that He might save much people.” <span
id="fr_1800"></span>[1801](#fn_1800) And that this was brought about
providentially the blessed David likewise declared saying in the hundred
and fourth Psalm: “And He called for a dearth upon the land: and brake
all the staff of bread. He sent a man before them: Joseph was sold for a
slave.” <span id="fr_1801"></span>[1802](#fn_1801) These two then; viz.,
the grace of God and free will seem opposed to each other, but really
are in harmony, and we gather from the system of goodness that we ought
to have both alike, lest if we withdraw one of them from man, we may
seem to have broken the rule of the Church’s faith: for when God sees us
inclined to will what is good, He meets, guides, and strengthens us: for
“At the voice of thy cry, as soon as He shall hear, He will answer
thee;” and:  “Call upon Me,” He says, “in the day of tribulation and I
will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify Me.” <span
id="fr_1802"></span>[1803](#fn_1802) And again, if He finds that we are
unwilling or have grown cold, He stirs our hearts with salutary
exhortations, by which a good will is either renewed or formed in us.
