#### <span id="iv.vii.viii.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.

<span id="iv.vii.viii.v-p1"></span>He shows by proofs drawn from nature
itself, that the law which his opponents lay down; viz., that the one
born ought to be of one substance with the one who bears, fails to hold
good in many cases.

<span id="iv.vii.viii.v-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.viii.v-p2.1"></span>It</span> would be tedious and almost
childish to speak further on this subject. But still in order to refute
that folly and madness of yours, in which you maintain that the one born
ought to be of one substance with the one who bears, i.e., that nothing
can produce something of a different nature to itself, I will bring
forward some instances of earthly things, to convince you that many
creatures are produced from things of a different nature. Not that it is
possible or right to make any comparison in such a case as this: but
that you may not doubt the possibility of that happening in the case of
the holy Nativity, which as you see takes place in these frail earthly
things. Bees, tiniest of creatures though they are, are yet so clever
and cunning that we read that they can be produced and spring from
things of an entirely different nature. For as they are creatures of
marvellous intelligence, and well endowed not merely with sense but with
foresight, they are produced from the gathered flowers of plants. What
greater instance do you think can be produced and quoted? Living
creatures are produced from inanimate: sensate from insensate. <span
id="fr_2606"></span>[2607](#fn_2606.md) What artificer, what architect was
there?  Who formed their bodies? Who breathed in their souls? Who gave
them articulate sounds by which to converse with each other? Who
fashioned and arranged these harmonies of their feet, the cunning of
their mouths, the neatness of their wings? Their powers, wrath,
foresight, movements, calmness, harmony, differences, wars, peace,
arrangements, contrivances, business, government, all those things
indeed which they have in common with men—from whose teaching, or whose
gift did they receive them? from whose implanting or instruction? Did
they gain this through generation? or learn it in their mother’s womb or
from her flesh? They never were in the womb, and had no experience of
generation. It was only that flowers which they culled were brought into
the hive and from this by a marvellous contrivance bees issued
forth. <span id="fr_2607"></span>[2608](#fn_2607.md) Then the womb of the
mother imparted nothing to the offspring: nor are bees produced from
bees. They are but their artificers, not their authors. From the
blossoms of plants living creatures proceed. What is there akin in
plants and animals? I fancy then that you see who is the contriver of
those things. Go now and inquire whether the Lord could bring about that
in the case of His own nativity, which you see that He procured in the
case of these tiniest of creatures. Perhaps it is needless after this to
add anything further. But still let us add in support of the argument
what may not be necessary to prove the point. We see how the air is
suddenly darkened, and the earth filled with locusts. Show me their
seed—their birth—their mothers. For, as you see, they proceed thence,
whence they have their birth. Assert in all these cases that the one who
is born must be of one substance with the one who bears. And in these
assertions you will be shown to be as silly, as you are wild in your
denial of the Nativity of the Lord. And what next? Do even *you* think
that we must go on any further? But still we will add something else.
There is no doubt that basilisks are produced from the eggs of the birds
which in Egypt they call the Ibis. What is there of kindred or
relationship between a bird and a serpent? Why is the thing born not of
one substance with that which bears it? And yet those who bear are not
the authors of all these things, nor do those who are born understand
them: but they result from secret causes, and from some inexplicable and
manifold law of nature which produces them. And you are bringing as
objections to His Nativity your petty assertions from earthly notions,
while you cannot explain the origin of those things, which are produced
by His bidding and command, whose will does everything, whose sway
causes everything: whom nothing can oppose or resist; and whose will is
sufficient for everything which can possibly be done.
