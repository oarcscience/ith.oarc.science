#### <span id="iv.iv.vi.xxiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXIV.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.xxiv-p1"></span>How the lands from which the
Canaanites were expelled, had been assigned to the seed of Shem.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.xxiv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.vi.xxiv-p2.1"></span>For</span>, as an ancient tradition tells
us, <span id="fr_1358"></span>[1359](#fn_1358.md) these same lands of the
Canaanites into which the children of Israel were brought, had been
formerly allotted to the children of Shem at the division of the world,
and afterward the descendants of Ham wickedly invading them with force
and violence took possession of them. And in this the righteous judgment
of God is shown, as He expelled from the land of others these who had
wrongfully taken possession of them, and restored to those others the
ancient property of their fathers which had been assigned to their
ancestors at the division of the world. And we can perfectly well see
that this figure holds good in our own case. For by nature God’s will
assigned the possession of our heart not to vices but to virtues, which,
after the fall of Adam were driven out from their own country by the
sins which grew up, i.e., by the Canaanites; and so when by God’s grace
they are by our efforts and labour restored again to it, we may hold
that they have not occupied the territory of another, but rather have
recovered their own country.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.xxiv-p3"></span> The “ancient tradition” to which
Cassian here alludes is given in the Clementine Recognitions I. xxix.,
xxx.; and in Epiphanius “Heresies,” c. lxvi. § 83, *sq*., where it is
given as an answer to the Manichæan objection against the cruelty and
injustice of the extermination of the Canaanites by the Israelites.
