#### <span id="iv.iii.x.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.

<span id="iv.iii.x.v-p1"></span>How the attack of accidie is twofold.

<span id="iv.iii.x.v-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.x.v-p2.1"></span>And</span> so the true Christian athlete who
desires to strive lawfully in the lists of perfection, should hasten to
expel this disease also from the recesses of his soul; and should strive
against this most evil spirit of accidie in both directions, so that he
may neither fall stricken through by the shaft of slumber, nor be driven
out from the monastic cloister, even though under some pious excuse or
pretext, and depart as a runaway.
