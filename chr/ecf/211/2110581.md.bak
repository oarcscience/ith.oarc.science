<span id="iv.iv.ii.xiv"></span>

#### <span id="iv.iv.ii.xiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIV.

<span id="iv.iv.ii.xiv-p1"></span>Of the continuance of the soul.

<span id="iv.iv.ii.xiv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.ii.xiv-p2.1"></span>Wherefore</span> every one while still
existing in this body should already be aware that he must be committed
to that state and office, of which he made himself a sharer and an
adherent while in this life, nor should he doubt that in that eternal
world he will be partner of him, whose servant and minister he chose to
make himself here: according to that saying of our Lord which says “If
any man serve Me, let him follow Me, and where I am, there shall My
servant also be.” <span id="fr_1111"></span>[1112](#fn_1111.md) For as the
kingdom of the devil is gained by consenting to sin, so the kingdom of
God is attained by the practice of virtue in purity of heart and
spiritual knowledge. But where the kingdom of God is, there most
certainly eternal life is enjoyed, and where the kingdom of the devil
is, there without doubt is death and the grave. And the man who is in
this condition, cannot praise the Lord, according to the saying of the
prophet which tells us: “The dead cannot praise Thee, O Lord; neither
all they that go down into the grave (doubtless of sin). But we,” says
he, “who live (not forsooth to sin nor to this world but to God) will
bless the Lord, from this time forth for evermore: for in death no man
remembereth God: but in the grave (of sin) who will confess to the
Lord?” <span id="fr_1112"></span>[1113](#fn_1112.md) i.e., no one will. For
no man even though he were to call himself a Christian a thousand times
over, or a monk, confesses God when he is sinning: no man who allows
those things which the Lord hates, remembereth God, nor calls himself
with any truth the servant of Him, whose commands he scorns with
obstinate rashness: in which death the blessed Apostle declares that the
widow is involved, who gives herself to pleasure, saying “a widow who
giveth herself to pleasure is dead while she liveth.” <span
id="fr_1113"></span>[1114](#fn_1113.md) There are then many who while still
living in this body are dead, and lying in the grave cannot praise God;
and on the contrary there are many who though they are dead in the body
yet bless God in the spirit, and praise Him, according to this: “O ye
spirits and souls of the righteous, bless ye the Lord:” <span
id="fr_1114"></span>[1115](#fn_1114.md) and “every spirit shall praise the
Lord.” <span id="fr_1115"></span>[1116](#fn_1115.md) And in the Apocalypse
the souls of them that are slain are not only said to praise God but to
address Him also. <span id="fr_1116"></span>[1117](#fn_1116.md) In the
gospel too the Lord says with still greater clearness to the Sadducees:
“Have ye not read that which was spoken by God, when He said to you: I
am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob. He is
not the God of the dead but of the living: for all do live unto
Him.” <span id="fr_1117"></span>[1118](#fn_1117.md) Of whom also the
Apostle says: “wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for
He hath prepared for them a city.” <span
id="fr_1118"></span>[1119](#fn_1118.md) For that they are not idle after
the separation from this body, and are not incapable of feeling, the
parable in the gospel shows, which tells us of the beggar Lazarus and
Dives clothed in purple, one of whom obtained a position of bliss, i.e.,
Abraham’s bosom, the other is consumed with the dreadful heat of eternal
fire. <span id="fr_1119"></span>[1120](#fn_1119.md) But if you care too to
understand the words spoken to the thief “To-day thou shalt be with Me
in Paradise,” <span id="fr_1120"></span>[1121](#fn_1120.md) what do they
clearly show but that not only does their former intelligence continue
with the souls, but also that in their changed condition they partake of
some state which corresponds to their actions and deserts? For the Lord
would certainly never have promised him this, if He had known that his
soul after being separated from the flesh would either have been
deprived of perception or have been resolved into nothing. For it was
not his flesh but his soul which was to enter Paradise with Christ. At
least we <span id="page_302">p. 302</span> <span
id="iv.iv.ii.xiv-Page_302"></span>must avoid, and shun with the utmost
horror, that wicked punctuation of the heretics, who, as they do not
believe that Christ could be found in Paradise on the same day on which
He descended into hell, thus punctuate “Verily, I say unto you to-day,”
and making a stop apply “thou shalt be with Me in Paradise,” in such a
way that they imagine that this promise was not fulfilled at once after
he departed from this life, but that it will be fulfilled after the
resurrection, <span id="fr_1121"></span>[1122](#fn_1121.md) as they do not
understand what before the time of His resurrection He declared to the
Jews, who fancied that He was hampered by human difficulties and
weakness of the flesh as they were: “No man hath ascended into heaven,
but He who came down from heaven, even the Son of man who is in
heaven:” <span id="fr_1122"></span>[1123](#fn_1122.md) by which He clearly
shows that the souls of the departed are not only not deprived of their
reason, but that they are not even without such feelings as hope and
sorrow, joy and fear, and that they already are beginning to taste
beforehand something of what is reserved for them at the last judgment,
and that they are not as some unbelievers hold resolved into nothing
after their departure from this life: <span
id="fr_1123"></span>[1124](#fn_1123.md) but that they live a more real
life, and are still more earnest in waiting on the praises of God. And
indeed to put aside for a little Scripture proofs, and to discuss, as
far as our ability permits us, a little about the nature of the soul
itself, is it not beyond the bounds of I will not say the folly, but the
madness of all stupidity, even to have the slightest suspicion that the
nobler part of man, in which as the blessed Apostle shows, the image and
likeness of God consists, <span id="fr_1124"></span>[1125](#fn_1124.md)
will, when the burden of the body with which it is oppressed in this
world is laid aside, become insensible, when, as it contains in itself
all the power of reason, it makes the dumb and senseless material flesh
sensible, by participation with it: especially when it follows, and the
order of reason itself demands that when the mind has put off the
grossness of the flesh with which it is now weighed down, it will
restore its intellectual powers better than ever, and receive them in a
purer and finer condition than it lost them. But so far did the blessed
Apostle recognize that what we say is true, that he actually wished to
depart from this flesh; that by separation from it, he might be able to
be joined more earnestly to the Lord; saying: “I desire to be dissolved
and to be with Christ, which is far better, for while we are in the body
we are absent from the Lord:” and therefore “we are bold and have our
desire always to be absent from the body, and present with the Lord.
Wherefore also we strive, whether absent or present, to be pleasing to
Him;” <span id="fr_1125"></span>[1126](#fn_1125.md) and he declares indeed
that the continuance of the soul which is in the flesh is distance from
the Lord, and absence from Christ, and trusts with entire faith that its
separation and departure from this flesh involves presence with Christ.
And again still more clearly the same Apostle speaks of this state of
the souls as one that is very full of life: “But ye are come to Mount
Sion, and the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an
innumerable company of angels, and the church of the first born, who are
written in heaven, and the spirits of just men made perfect.” <span
id="fr_1126"></span>[1127](#fn_1126.md) Of which spirits he speaks in
another passage, “Furthermore we have had instructors of our flesh, and
we reverenced them: shall we not much more be subject to the Father of
spirits and live?” <span id="fr_1127"></span>[1128](#fn_1127.md)

<span id="iv.iv.ii.xiv-p15"></span> Augustine (De Hæres. c. lix.) speaks
of “Seleuciani” or “Hermiani” as denying a visible Paradise, and a
future resurrection; and again in c. lxxxiii. he speaks of some Arabian
heretics, as teaching that the soul died and was dissolved (dissolvi)
with the body and that it would at the end of the world be revived and
rise again. These were the heretics of whom Eusebius speaks in his Eccl.
History Book VI. c. xxxvii., where he tells us that they were
successfully refuted by Origen. It is probably to this last error that
Cassian is here making allusion.
