#### <span id="iv.vi.viii.xxi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXI.

<span id="iv.vi.viii.xxi-p1"></span>How the Evangelist John is said to
have shown the value of relaxation.

<span id="iv.vi.viii.xxi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.viii.xxi-p2.1"></span>It</span> is said that the blessed John,
while he was gently stroking a partridge with his hands suddenly saw a
philosopher approaching him in the garb of a hunter, who was astonished
that a man of so great fame and reputation should demean himself to such
paltry and trivial amusements, and said: “Can you be that John, whose
great and famous reputation attracted me also with the greatest desire
for your acquaintance? Why then do you occupy yourself with such poor
amusements?” To whom the blessed John: “What is it,” said he, “that you
are carrying in your hand?” The other replied: “a bow.” “And why,” said
he, “do you not always carry it everywhere bent?” To whom the other
replied: “It would not do, for the force of its stiffness would be
relaxed by its being continually bent, and it would be lessened and
destroyed, and when the time came for it to send stouter arrows after
some beast, its stiffness would be lost by the excessive and continuous
strain. and it would be impossible for the more powerful bolts to be
shot.” “And, my lad,” said the blessed John, “do not let this slight and
short relaxation of my mind disturb you, as unless it sometimes relieved
and relaxed the rigour of its purpose by some recreation, the <span

to the unbroken strain, and would be unable when need required,
implicitly to follow what was right.” <span
