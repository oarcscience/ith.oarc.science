#### <span id="iv.iv.iii.xvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVI.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xvi-p1"></span>How to seek for discretion.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xvi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.iii.xvi-p2.1"></span>We</span> ought then with all our might
to strive for the virtue of discretion by the power of humility, as it
will keep us uninjured by either extreme, for there is an old saying
<span class="Greek"><span id="iv.iv.iii.xvi-p2.2"></span>ἀ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.iv.iii.xvi-p2.3"></span>κρότητες
ἰσότητες</span>, i.e., extremes meet. For excess of fasting and gluttony
come to the same thing, and an unlimited continuance of vigils is
equally injurious to a monk as the torpor of a deep sleep: for when a
man is weakened by excessive abstinence he is sure to return to that
condition in which a man is kept through carelessness and negligence, so
that we have often seen those who could not be deceived by gluttony,
destroyed by excessive fasting and by reason of weakness liable to that
passion which they had before overcome. Unreasonable vigils and nightly
watchings have also been the ruin of some whom sleep could not get the
better of: wherefore as the apostle says “with the arms of righteousness
on the right hand and on the left,” <span
id="fr_1195"></span>[1196](#fn_1195.md) we pass on with due moderation, and
walk between the two extremes, under the guidance of discretion, that we
may not consent to be led away from the path of continence marked out
for us, nor fall by undue carelessness into the pleasures of the palate
and belly.
