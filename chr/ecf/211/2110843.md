#### <span id="iv.v.iv.ii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.

<span id="iv.v.iv.ii-p1"></span>A question why the merit of good deeds
may not be ascribed to the exertions of the man who does them.

<span id="iv.v.iv.ii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.iv.ii-p2.1"></span>Then</span> Germanus: As we are almost shut
out, so to speak, by the greatness of that splendid virtue, which was
described in last night’s discussion, from believing in the possibility
of it, so, if you will pardon my saying so, it seems to us absurd for
the reward of our efforts, i.e., perfect chastity, which is gained by
the earnestness of one’s own toil, not to be ascribed chiefly to the
exertions of the man who makes the effort. For it is foolish, if, when
for example, we see a husbandman taking the utmost pains over the
cultivation of the ground, we do not ascribe the fruits to his
exertions.

[Next: Chapter III. The answer that without God's help not only perfect
chastity but all good of every kind cannot be performed.](2110844)
