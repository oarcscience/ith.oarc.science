#### <span id="iv.iv.ii.xviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.

<span id="iv.iv.ii.xviii-p1"></span>Comparison of a soul and a
millstone.

<span id="iv.iv.ii.xviii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.ii.xviii-p2.1"></span>And</span> this movement of the heart is
not unsuitably illustrated by the comparison of a mill wheel, which the
headlong rush of water whirls round, with revolving impetus, and which
can never stop its work so long as it is driven round by the action of
the water: but it is in the power of the man who directs it, to decide
whether he will have wheat or barley or darnel ground by it. That
certainly must be crushed by it which is put into it by the man who has
charge of that business. So then the mind also through the trials of the
present life is driven about by the torrents of temptations pouring in
upon it from all sides, and cannot be free from the flow of thoughts:
but the character of the thoughts which it should either throw off or
admit for itself, it will provide by the efforts of its own earnestness
and diligence: for if, as we said, we constantly recur to meditation on
the Holy Scriptures and raise our memory towards the recollection of
spiritual things and the desire of perfection and the hope of future
bliss, spiritual thoughts are sure to rise from this, and cause the mind
to dwell on those things on which we have been meditating. But if we are
overcome by sloth or carelessness and spend our time in idle gossip, or
are entangled in the cares of this world and unnecessary anxieties, the
result will be that a sort of species of tares will spring up, and
afford an injurious occupation for our hearts, and as our <span

id="iv.iv.ii.xviii-Page_304"></span>Lord and Saviour says, wherever the
treasure of our works or purpose may be, there also our heart is sure to
continue. <span id="fr_1130"></span>[1131](#fn_1130)
