#### <span id="ii.v.ii.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VIII.

<span id="ii.v.ii.viii-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.ii.viii-p1.1"></span>Do</span> you flatter yourself on account
of the attribute of virginity? Remember Adam and Eve fell when they were
virgins, and that the perfect purity of their bodies did not profit them
when they sinned. The virgin who sins is to be compared to Eve, and not
to Mary. We do not deny that, in the present life, there is the remedy
of repentance, but we remind you rather to hope for reward, than to look
for pardon. For it is disgraceful that those should ask for indulgence
who are expecting the crown of virginity, and that those should commit
anything unlawful who have even cut themselves off from things lawful;
for it must be remembered that it is lawful to contract an alliance by
marriage. And as those are to be praised who, from love to Christ, and
for the glory of the kingdom of heaven, have despised the tie of
wedlock, so those are to be condemned who, through the pleasure of
incontinence, after they have vowed themselves to God, have recourse to
the Apostolic remedy. Therefore, as we have said, those who decline
marriage despise not things unlawful, but things lawful. And if that
class of people swear, if they speak evil of others, if they are
detractors, or if they patiently listen to detractors, if they return
evil for evil, if they incur the charge of covetousness with respect to
other people’s property, or of avarice in regard to their own, if they
cherish the poison of revenge or envy, if they either say or think
anything unbefitting against the institutions of the law or the
Apostles, if with a desire of pleasing in the flesh, they exhibit
themselves dressed up and adorned, if they do any other unlawful things,
as is only too common, what will it profit them to have spurned what is
lawful, while they practice what is not lawful? If you wish it to be of
advantage to you, that you have despised things lawful, take care that
you do not any of those things which are not lawful. For, it is foolish
to have dreaded that which is in its nature less, and not to dread that
which is intrinsically more \[or not to avoid those things <span
id="fr_179"></span>[180](#fn_179.md) which are interdicted, <span
id="page_62">p. 62</span> <span id="ii.v.ii.viii-Page_62"></span>while
such things as are permitted meet with contempt\]. For the Apostle says,
“She that is unmarried careth for the things of the Lord, how she may
please God, that she may be holy both in body and spirit; but she who is
married careth for the things of this world, how she may please <span
id="fr_180"></span>[181](#fn_180.md) her husband.” He thus affirms that the
married woman pleases her husband by thinking of worldly things, while
the unmarried woman pleases God, inasmuch as she has no anxiety about
the things of the world. Let him tell me, then, whom *she* desires to
please, who has no husband, and yet cares for the things of the world?
Shall not the married woman, in such a case, be preferred to her? Yes,
since she by caring for the things of the world pleases at least her
husband, but the other neither pleases her husband, since she does not
have one, nor can she please God. <span
id="fr_181"></span>[182](#fn_181.md) But it is not fitting that we should
pass over in silence that which he said: “The unmarried woman careth for
the things of the Lord, how she may please God, that she may be holy
both in body and spirit” \[she careth, he says, for the things of the
Lord; she does not care for the things of the world, or of men, but for
the things of God\]. What, then, *are* the things of the Lord? Let the
Apostle tell: “Whatsoever <span id="fr_182"></span>[183](#fn_182.md) things
are holy, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are lovely,
whatsoever things are of good report, if there be any virtue, and if
there be any praise of doctrine”: these are the things of the Lord,
which holy and truly apostolic virgins meditate upon, and think of, day
and night, without any interval of time. Of the Lord is the resurrection
of the dead, of the Lord is immortality, of the Lord is incorruption, of
the Lord is that splendor of the sun which is promised to the saints, as
it is written in the Gospel, “Then shall the righteous shine forth as
the sun in the kingdom of their Father”: <span
id="fr_183"></span>[184](#fn_183.md) of the Lord are the many mansions of
the righteous in the heavens, of the Lord is the fruit which is
produced, whether thirty fold, or sixty fold, or an hundred fold. Those
virgins who think on these things, and by what works they may be able to
merit them, think of the things of the Lord. Of the Lord, too, is the
law of the new and old testament, in which shine forth the holy
utterances of his lips; and if any virgins meditate without intermission
on these things, they think of the things of the Lord. In that case,
there is fulfilled in them the saying of the prophet: “The eternal <span
id="fr_184"></span>[185](#fn_184.md) foundations are upon a solid rock, and
the commands of God are in the heart of the holy woman.”
