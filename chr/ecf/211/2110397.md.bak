#### <span id="iv.iii.v.xxiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXIV.

<span id="iv.iii.v.xxiv-p1"></span>How in Egypt we saw that the daily
fast was broken without scruple on our arrival.

<span id="iv.iii.v.xxiv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.v.xxiv-p2.1"></span>When</span> we had come from the region
of Syria and had sought the province of Egypt, in our desire to learn
the rules of the Elders, we were astonished at the alacrity of heart
with which we were there received so that no rule forbidding refreshment
till the appointed hour of the fast was over was observed, such as we
had been brought up to observe in the monasteries of Palestine; but
except in the case of the regular days, Wednesdays and Fridays, <span
id="page_243">p. 243</span> <span
id="iv.iii.v.xxiv-Page_243"></span>wherever we went the daily fast <span
id="fr_863"></span>[864](#fn_863.md) was broken: <span
id="fr_864"></span>[865](#fn_864.md) and when we asked why the daily fast
was thus ignored by them without scruple one of the elders replied: “The
opportunity for fasting is always with me. But as I am going to conduct
you on your way, I cannot always keep you with me. And a fast, although
it is useful and advisable, is yet a free-will offering. But the
exigencies of a command require the fulfilment of a work of charity. And
so receiving Christ in you I ought to refresh Him but when I have sent
you on your way I shall be able to balance the hospitality offered for
His sake by a stricter fast on my own account.  For ‘the children of the
bridegroom cannot fast while the bridegroom is with them:’ <span
id="fr_865"></span>[866](#fn_865.md) but when he has departed, then they
will rightly fast.”

<span id="iv.iii.v.xxiv-p4"></span> The allusion is here to the sparing
diet and voluntary fasts of the monks, among whom but one meal a day was
usual (see the note on III. xiii.), and though this was ordinarily taken
at midday, yet many of the more celebrated anchorites never broke their
fast till the evening; e.g. S. Antony is said never to have eaten till
sunset (Vita Anton.) and S. Jerome gives a similar account of Hilarion
(Vita Hil. § 4), while other instances of voluntary fasts are given by
Cassian in the following chapters, xxv.–xxvii. The “station” days,
however, viz., Wednesday and Friday, being of ecclesiastical authority,
were strictly observed as a matter of rule, but these other voluntary
fasts at other times were to be freely broken through on account of the
arrival of visitors. See the Conferences II. xxvi., XXI. xiv., XXIV.
xxi., and cf. Rufinus, History of the Monks II. vii., Palladius, the
Lausiac History, c. lii. So the Rule of S. Benedict (c. liii.) orders
that on the arrival of visitors the Superior is to sit at table with
them and break his fast, unless it be a special fast day which may not
be broken; but the brethren are to observe the regular fasts.
