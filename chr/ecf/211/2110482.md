#### <span id="iv.iii.ix.xi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XI.

<span id="iv.iii.ix.xi-p1"></span>How we can decide what is useful and
the sorrow according to God, and what is devilish and deadly.

<span id="iv.iii.ix.xi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.ix.xi-p2.1"></span>But</span> that dejection and sorrow which
“worketh repentance steadfast unto salvation” is obedient, civil,
humble, kindly, gentle, and patient, as it springs from the love of God,
and unweariedly extends itself from desire of perfection to every bodily
grief and sorrow of spirit; and somehow or other rejoicing and feeding
on hope of its own profit preserves all the gentleness of courtesy and
forbearance, as it has in itself all the fruits of the Holy Spirit of
which the same Apostle gives the list: “But the fruit of the Spirit is
love, joy, peace, forbearance, goodness, benignity, faith, mildness,
modesty.” <span id="fr_961"></span>[962](#fn_961.md) But the other kind is
rough, impatient, hard, full of rancour and useless grief and penal
despair, and breaks down the man on whom it has fastened, and hinders
him from energy and wholesome sorrow, as it is unreasonable, and not
only hampers the efficacy of his prayers, but actually destroys all
those fruits of the Spirit of which we spoke, which that other sorrow
knows how to produce.

in three ways, all sorrow and dejection should be resisted as
hurtful.](2110483.md)
