#### <span id="iv.vi.vii.x-p0.1"></span>Chapter X.

<span id="iv.vi.vii.x-p1"></span>How those who are on the way to
perfection are truly humble, and feel that they always stand in need of
God’s grace.

<span id="iv.vi.vii.x-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.vii.x-p2.1"></span>When</span> then holy men feel that they
are oppressed by the weight of earthly thoughts and fall away from their
loftiness of mind, and that they are led away against their will or
rather without knowing it, into the law of sin and death, and (to pass
over other matters) are kept back by those actions which I described
above, which are good and right though earthly, from the vision of God;
they have something to groan over constantly to the Lord; they have
something for which indeed to humble themselves, and in their contrition
to profess themselves not in words only but in heart, sinners; and for
this, while they continually ask of the Lord’s grace pardon for
everything that day by day they commit when overcome by the weakness of
the flesh, they should shed without ceasing true tears of penitence; as
they see that being involved even to the very end of their life in the
very same troubles, with continual sorrow for which they are tried, they
cannot even offer their prayers without harassing thoughts. So then as
they know by experience that through the hindrance of the burden of the
flesh they cannot by human strength reach the desired end, nor be united
according to their heart’s desire with that chief and highest good, but
that they are led away from the vision of it captive to worldly things,
they betake themselves to the grace of God, “Who justifieth the
ungodly,” <span id="fr_2263"></span>[2264](#fn_2263.md) and cry out with
the Apostle: O wretched man that I am! Who shall deliver me from the
body of this death? Thanks be to God through our Lord Jesus
Christ.” <span id="fr_2264"></span>[2265](#fn_2264.md) For they feel that
they cannot perform the good that they would, but are ever falling into
the evil which they would not, and which they hate, i.e., wandering
thoughts and care for carnal things.
