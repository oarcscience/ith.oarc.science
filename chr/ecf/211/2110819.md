#### <span id="iv.iv.xi.xii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XII.

<span id="iv.iv.xi.xii-p1"></span>A question as to how spiritual
thoughts can be retained without losing them.

<span id="iv.iv.xi.xii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.xi.xii-p2.1"></span>Germanus</span>: We think that you have
described to us not only the system of this spiritual discipline for
which we asked, but perfection itself; and this with great clearness and
openness. For what can be more perfect and sublime than for the
recollection of God to be embraced in so brief a meditation, and for it,
dwelling on a single verse, to escape from all the limitations of things
visible, and to comprise in one short word the thoughts of all our
prayers. And therefore we beg you to explain to us one thing which still
remains; viz., how we can keep firm hold of this verse which you have
given us as a formula, in such a way that, as we have been by God’s
grace set free from the trifles of worldly thoughts, so we may also keep
a steady grasp on all spiritual ones.
