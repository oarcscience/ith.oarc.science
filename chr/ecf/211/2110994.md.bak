#### <span id="iv.vi.iv.vii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.

<span id="iv.vi.iv.vii-p1"></span>The answer showing how far we ought to
preserve the recollection of previous actions.

<span id="iv.vi.iv.vii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.vii-p2.1"></span>Pinufius</span>: Your question, as has
been already said above, was not raised with regard to the character of
penitence, but with regard to its end, and the marks of satisfaction: to
which, as I think, a fair and pertinent reply has been given. But what
you have said as to the remembrance of sins is sufficiently useful and
needful to men who are still doing penance, that they may with constant
smiting of the breast say: “For I acknowledge my wickedness: and my sin
is ever before me;” and this too: “And I will think for my sin.” <span
id="fr_2122"></span>[2123](#fn_2122.md) While then we do penance, and are
still grieved by the recollection of faulty actions, the shower of tears
which is caused by the confession of our faults is sure to quench the
fire of our conscience. But when, while a man is still in this state of
humility of heart and contrition of spirit and continuing to labour and
to weep, the remembrance of these things fades away, and the thorns of
conscience are by God’s grace extracted from his inmost heart, then it
is clear that he has attained to the end of satisfaction and the reward
of pardon, and that he is purged from the stain of the sins he has
committed. To which state of forgetfulness we can only attain by the
obliteration of our former sins and likings, and by perfect and complete
purity of heart. And this most certainly will not be attained by any of
those who from sloth or carelessness have failed to purge out their
faults, but only by one who by constantly continuing to groan and sigh
sorrowfully has removed every spot of his former stains, and by the
goodness of his heart and his labour has proclaimed to the Lord: “I have
acknowledged my sin, and mine unrighteousness have I not hid;” and: “My
tears have been my meat day and night;” so that in the end it may be
vouchsafed to him to hear these words: “Let thy voice cease from
weeping, and thine eyes from tears: for there is a reward for thy
labour, saith the Lord;” <span id="fr_2123"></span>[2124](#fn_2123.md) and
these words also may be uttered of him by the voice of the Lord: “I have
blotted out as a cloud thine iniquities, and as a mist thy sins:” and
again: “I even I am He that blotteth out thine iniquities for mine own
sake, and thine offences I will no longer remember;” <span
id="fr_2124"></span>[2125](#fn_2124.md) and so, when he is freed from the
“cords of his sins,” by which “everyone is bound,” <span
id="fr_2125"></span>[2126](#fn_2125.md) he will with all thanksgiving sing
to the Lord: “Thou hast broken my chains: I will offer to thee the
sacrifice of praise.” <span id="fr_2126"></span>[2127](#fn_2126.md)
