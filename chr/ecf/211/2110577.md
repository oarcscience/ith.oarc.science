#### <span id="iv.iv.ii.x-p0.1"></span>Chapter X.

<span id="iv.iv.ii.x-p1"></span>The answer that not the reward, but the
doing of them will come to an end.

<span id="iv.iv.ii.x-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.ii.x-p2.1"></span>Moses</span>. I did not say that the reward
for a good work would be taken away, as the Lord Himself says:
“Whosoever shall give to one of the least of these, a cup of cold water
only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall not lose
his reward:” <span id="fr_1092"></span>[1093](#fn_1092) but I maintain
that the doing of a thing, which either bodily necessity, or the
onslaught of the flesh, or the inequalities of this world, compel to be
done, will be taken away. For diligence in reading, and self-denial in
fasting, are usefully practised for purifying the heart and chastening
the flesh in this life only, as long as “the flesh lusteth against the
spirit,” <span id="fr_1093"></span>[1094](#fn_1093) and sometimes we see
that even in this life they are taken away from those men who are worn
out with excessive toil, or bodily infirmity or old age, and cannot be
practised by them. How much more then will they come to an end
hereafter, when “this corruptible shall have put on incorruption,” <span
id="fr_1094"></span>[1095](#fn_1094) and the body which is now “a
natural body” shall have risen “a spiritual body” <span
id="fr_1095"></span>[1096](#fn_1095) and the flesh shall have begun to
be such that it no longer lusts against the spirit? And of this the
blessed Apostle also clearly speaks, when he says that “bodily exercise
is profitable for a little: but godliness” (by which he certainly means
love) “is profitable for all things, having the promise of the life that
now is and of that which is to come.” <span
id="fr_1096"></span>[1097](#fn_1096) This clearly shows that what is
said to be useful for a little, is not to be practised for all time, and
cannot possibly by itself alone confer the highest state of perfection
on the man who slaves at it. For the term “for a little” may mean either
of the two things, i.e., it may refer to the shortness of the time,
because bodily exercise cannot possibly last on with man both in this
life and in the world to come: or it may refer to the smallness of the
profit which results from exercising the flesh, because bodily
austerities produce some sort of beginnings of progress, but not the
actual perfection of love, which has the promise of the life that now is
and of that which is to come: and therefore we deem that the practice of
the aforesaid works is needful, because without them we cannot climb the
heights of love. For what you call works of religion and mercy are
needful in this life while these inequalities and differences of
conditions still prevail; but even here we should not look for them to
be performed, unless such a large proportion of poor, needy, and sick
folk abounded, which is brought about by the wickedness of men; viz., of
those who have grasped and kept for their own use (without however using
them) those things which were granted to all by the Creator of all
alike. As long then as this inequality lasts in this world, this sort of
work will be needful and useful to the man that practises it, as it
brings to a good purpose and pious will the reward of an eternal
inheritance: but it will come to an end in the life to come, where
equality will reign, when there will be no longer inequality, on account
of which these things must be done, but all men will pass from these
manifold practical works to the love of God, and contemplation of
heavenly things in continual purity of heart: to which those men who are
urgent in devoting themselves to knowledge and purifying the heart, have
chosen to give themselves up with all their might and main, betaking
themselves, while they are still in the flesh, to that duty, in which
they are to continue, when they have laid aside corruption, and when
they come to that promise of the Lord the Saviour, which says “Blessed
are the pure in heart for they shall see God.” <span
