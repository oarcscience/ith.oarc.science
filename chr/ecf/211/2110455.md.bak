#### <span id="iv.iii.viii.vii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.

<span id="iv.iii.viii.vii-p1"></span>Of the only case in which anger is
useful to us.

<span id="iv.iii.viii.vii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.viii.vii-p2.1"></span>We</span> have, it must be admitted, a
use for anger excellently implanted in us for which alone it is useful
and profitable for us to admit it, viz., when we are indignant and rage
against the lustful emotions of our heart, and are vexed that the things
which we are ashamed to do or say before men have risen up in the
lurking places of our heart, as we tremble at the presence of the
angels, and of God Himself, who pervades all things everywhere, and fear
with the utmost dread the eye of Him from whom the secrets of our hearts
cannot possibly be hid.
