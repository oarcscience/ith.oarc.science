#### <span id="ii.v.ii.i-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.

<span id="ii.v.ii.i-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.ii.i-p1.1"></span>How</span> great blessedness, among heavenly
gifts, belongs to holy virginity, besides the testimonies of the
Scriptures, we learn also from the practice of the Church, by which we
are taught that a peculiar merit belongs to those who have devoted
themselves to it by special consecration. For while the whole multitude
of those that believe receive equal gifts of grace, and all rejoice in
the same blessings of the sacraments, those who are virgins possess
something above the rest, since, out of the holy and unstained company
of the Church, they are chosen by the Holy Spirit, and are presented by
the bishop <span id="fr_161"></span>[162](#fn_161) at the altar of God,
as if being more holy and pure sacrifices, on account of the merits of
their voluntary dedication. This is truly a sacrifice worthy of God,
inasmuch as it is the offering of so precious a being, and none will
please him more than the sacrifice of his own image. For I think that
the Apostle especially referred to a sacrifice of this kind, when he
said, “Now, I beseech you, brethren, by the mercy of God, that you
present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable <span
id="fr_162"></span>[163](#fn_162) to God.” Virginity, therefore,
possesses both that which others have, and that which others have not;
while it obtains both common and special grace, and rejoices (so to
speak) in its own peculiar privilege of consecration. For ecclesiastical
authority permits us to style virgins also the brides of Christ; while,
after the manner of brides, it veils those whom it consecrates to the
Lord, openly exhibiting those as very especially about to possess
spiritual marriage who have fled away from carnal fellowship. And those
are worthily united, after a spiritual manner, to God, in accordance
with the analogy of marriage, who, from love to him, have set at nought
human alliances. In their case, that saying of the apostle finds its
fullest possible fulfillment, “He who is joined to the Lord, <span
id="fr_163"></span>[164](#fn_163) is one spirit.”
