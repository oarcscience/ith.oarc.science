#### <span id="iv.vi.vii.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.

<span id="iv.vi.vii.v-p1"></span>How no one can be continually intent
upon that highest good.

<span id="iv.vi.vii.v-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.vii.v-p2.1"></span>For</span> who, when “delivering the poor
from the hand of them that are too strong for him, <span
id="page_522">p. 522</span> <span id="iv.vi.vii.v-Page_522"></span>and
the needy and the poor from them that strip him,” who when “breaking the
jaws of the wicked and snatching their prey from between their
teeth,” <span id="fr_2247"></span>[2248](#fn_2247.md) can with a calm mind
regard the glory of the Divine Majesty during the actual work of
intervention? Who when ministering support to the poor, or when
receiving with benevolent kindness the crowds that come to him, can at
the very moment when he is with anxious mind perplexed for the wants of
his brethren, contemplate the vastness of the bliss on high, and while
he is shaken by the troubles and cares of the present life look forward
to the state of the world to come with an heart raised above the stains
of earth? Whence the blessed David when laying down that this alone is
good for man, longs to cling constantly to God, and says: “It is good
for me to cling to God, and to put my hope in the Lord.” <span
id="fr_2248"></span>[2249](#fn_2248.md) And Ecclesiastes also declares that
this cannot be done without fault by any of the saints, and says: “For
there is not a righteous man upon earth, that doeth good and sinneth
not.” <span id="fr_2249"></span>[2250](#fn_2249.md) For who, even if he be
the chief of all righteous and holy men, can we ever think could, while
bound in the chains of this life, so acquire this chief good, as never
to cease from divine contemplation, or be thought to be drawn away by
earthly thoughts even for a short time from Him Who alone is good? Who
ever takes no care for food, none for clothing or other carnal things,
or when anxious about receiving the brethren, or change of place, or
building his cell, has never desired the aid of man’s assistance, nor
when harassed by scarcity and want has incurred this sentence of reproof
from the Lord: “Be not anxious for your life what ye shall eat, nor for
your body what ye shall put on”? <span
id="fr_2250"></span>[2251](#fn_2250.md) Further we confidently assert that
even the Apostle Paul himself who surpassed in the number of his
sufferings the toils of all the saints, could not possibly fulfil this,
as he himself testifies to the disciples in the Acts of the Apostles:
“Ye yourselves know that these hands have ministered to my needs, and to
the needs of those who were with me,” or when in writing in the
Thessalonians he testifies that he “worked in labour and weariness night
and day.” <span id="fr_2251"></span>[2252](#fn_2251.md) And although for
this there were great rewards for his merits prepared, yet his mind,
however holy and sublime it might be, could not help being sometimes
drawn away from that heavenly contemplation by its attention to earthly
labours. Further, when he saw himself enriched with such practical
fruits, and on the other hand considered in his heart the good of
meditation, and weighed as it were in one scale the profit of all these
labours and in the other the delights of divine contemplation, when for
a long time he had corrected the balance in his breast, while the vast
rewards for his labours delighted him on one side, and on the other the
desire for unity with and the inseparable companionship of Christ
inclined him to depart this life, at last in his perplexity he cries out
and says: “What I shall choose I know not. For I am in a strait betwixt
two, having a desire to depart and to be with Christ, for it were much
better: but to abide in the flesh is more necessary for your
sakes.” <span id="fr_2252"></span>[2253](#fn_2252.md) Though then in many
ways he preferred this excellent good to all the fruits of his
preaching, yet he submits himself in consideration of love, without
which none can gain the Lord; and for their sakes, whom hitherto he had
soothed with milk as nourishment from the breasts of the gospel, does
not refuse to be parted from Christ, which is bad for himself though
useful for others. For he is driven to choose this the rather by that
excessive goodness of his whereby for the salvation of his brethren he
is ready, were it possible, to incur even the last evil of an Anathema.
“For I could wish,” he says, “that I myself were Anathema from Christ
for my brethren’s sake, who are my kinsmen according to the flesh, who
are Israelites,” <span id="fr_2253"></span>[2254](#fn_2253.md) i.e., I
could wish to be subject not only to temporal, but even to perpetual
punishment, if only all men, were it possible, might enjoy the
fellowship of Christ: for I am sure that the salvation of all would be
better for Christ and for me than my own. That then the Apostle might
perfectly gain this chief good, i.e., to enjoy the vision of God and to
be joined continually to Christ, he was ready to be parted from this
body, which as it is feeble and hindered by the many requirements of its
frailties cannot help separating from union with Christ: for it is
impossible for the mind, that is harassed by such frequent cares, and
hampered by such various and tiresome troubles, always to enjoy the
Divine vision. For what aim of the saints can be so persistent, what
purpose can be so high that that crafty plotter does not sometimes
destroy it? Who has frequented the recesses of the desert and shunned
intercourse with all men in such a way that he never trips by
unnecessary thoughts, and by looking on things or being occupied in
earthly actions falls away from that contemplation of God, which truly
alone is good? Who ever could preserve such fervour of spirit <span
id="page_523">p. 523</span> <span id="iv.vi.vii.v-Page_523"></span>as
not sometimes to pass by roving thoughts from his attention to prayer,
and fall away suddenly from heavenly to earthly things? Which of us (to
pass over other times of wandering) even at the very moment when he
raises his soul in prayer to God on high, does not fall into a sort of
stupor, and even against his will offend by that very thing from which
he hoped for pardon of his sins? Who, I ask, is so alert and vigilant as
never, while he is singing a Psalm to God, to allow his mind to wander
from the meaning of Scripture? Who is so intimate with and closely
joined to God, as to congratulate himself on having carried out for a
single day that rule of the Apostle’s, whereby he bids us pray without
ceasing? <span id="fr_2254"></span>[2255](#fn_2254.md) And though all these
things may seem to some, who are involved in grosser sins, to be trivial
and altogether foreign to sin, yet to those who know the value of
perfection a quantity even of very small matters becomes most serious.
