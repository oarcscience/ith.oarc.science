<span id="iv.v.iv.xv"></span>

#### <span id="iv.v.iv.xv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XV.

<span id="iv.v.iv.xv-p1"></span>Of the manifold grace of men’s calls.

<span id="iv.v.iv.xv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.iv.xv-p2.1"></span>And</span> by this it is clearly shown that
God’s “judgments are inscrutable and His ways past finding out,” <span
id="fr_1842"></span>[1843](#fn_1842.md) by which He draws mankind to
salvation. And this too we can prove by the instances of calls in the
gospels. For He chose Andrew and Peter and the rest of the apostles by
the free compassion of His grace when they were thinking nothing of
their healing and salvation. Zacchæus, when in his faithfulness he was
struggling to see the Lord, and making up for his littleness of stature
by the height of the sycamore tree, He not only received, but actually
honoured by the blessing of His dwelling with him. Paul even against his
will and resisting He drew to Him. Another He charged to cleave to Him
so closely that when he asked for the shortest possible delay in order
to bury his father He did not grant it. To Cornelius when constantly
attending to prayers and alms the way of salvation was shown by way of
recompense, and by the visitation of an angel he was bidden to summon
Peter, and learn from him the words of salvation, whereby he might be
saved with all his. And so the manifold wisdom of God grants with
manifold and inscrutable kindness salvation to men; and imparts to each
one according to his capacity the grace of His bounty, so that He wills
to grant His healing not according to the uniform power of His Majesty
but according to the measure of the faith in which He finds each one, or
as He Himself has imparted it to each one. For when one believed that
for the cure of his leprosy the will of Christ alone was sufficient He
healed him by the simple consent of His will, saying: “I will, be thou
clean.” <span id="fr_1843"></span>[1844](#fn_1843.md) When another prayed
that He would come and raise his dead daughter by laying His hands on
her, He entered his house as he had hoped, and granted what was asked of
Him. When another believed that what was essential for his salvation
depended on His command, and answered: “Speak the word only, and my
servant shall be healed,” <span id="fr_1844"></span>[1845](#fn_1844.md) He
restored to their former strength the limbs that were relaxed, by the
power of a word, saying: “Go thy way, and as thou hast believed so be it
unto thee.” <span id="fr_1845"></span>[1846](#fn_1845.md) To others hoping
for restoration from the touch of His hem, He granted rich gifts of
healing. To some, when asked, He bestowed remedies for their diseases.
To others He afforded the means of healing unasked: others He urged on
to hope, saying: “Willest thou to be made whole?” <span
id="fr_1846"></span>[1847](#fn_1846.md) to others when they were without
hope He brought help spontaneously. The desires of some He searched out
before satisfying their wants, saying: “What will ye that I should do
for you?” <span id="fr_1847"></span>[1848](#fn_1847.md) To another who knew
not the way to obtain what he desired, He showed it in His kindness,
saying: “If thou believest thou shalt see the glory of God.” <span
id="fr_1848"></span>[1849](#fn_1848.md) Among some so richly did He pour
<span id="page_433">p. 433</span> <span
id="iv.v.iv.xv-Page_433"></span>forth the mighty works of His cures that
of them the Evangelist says: “And He healed all their sick.” <span
id="fr_1849"></span>[1850](#fn_1849.md) But among others the unfathomable
depth of Christ’s beneficence was so stopped up, that it was said: “And
Jesus could do there no mighty works because of their unbelief.” <span
id="fr_1850"></span>[1851](#fn_1850.md) And so the bounty of God is
actually shaped according to the capacity of man’s faith, so that to one
it is said: “According to thy faith be it unto thee:” <span
id="fr_1851"></span>[1852](#fn_1851.md) and to another: “Go thy way, and as
thou hast believed so be it unto thee;” <span
id="fr_1852"></span>[1853](#fn_1852.md) to another “Be it unto thee
according as thou wilt,” <span id="fr_1853"></span>[1854](#fn_1853.md) and
again to another: “Thy faith hath made thee whole.” <span
id="fr_1854"></span>[1855](#fn_1854.md)
