#### <span id="iv.iii.viii.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VIII.

<span id="iv.iii.viii.viii-p1"></span>Instances from the life of the
blessed David in which anger was rightly felt.

<span id="iv.iii.viii.viii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.viii.viii-p2.1"></span>And</span> at any rate (this is the
case), when we are agitated against this very anger, because it has
stolen on us against our brother, and when in wrath we expel its deadly
incitements, nor suffer it to have a dangerous lurking place in the
recesses of our heart. To be angry in this fashion even that prophet
teaches us who had so completely expelled it from his own feelings that
he would not retaliate even on his enemies and those delivered by God
into his hands: when he says “Be ye angry and sin not.” <span
id="fr_929"></span>[930](#fn_929.md) For he, when he had longed for water
from the well of Bethlehem, and had been given it by his mighty men, who
had brought it through the midst of the hosts of the enemy, at once
poured it out on the ground: and thus in his anger extinguished the
delicious feeling of his desire, and poured it out to the Lord, without
satisfying the longing that he had expressed, saying: “That be <span
id="page_260">p. 260</span> <span
id="iv.iii.viii.viii-Page_260"></span>far from me that I should do this!
Shall I drink the blood of those men who went forth on the danger of
their souls?” <span id="fr_930"></span>[931](#fn_930.md) And when Shimei
threw stones at King David and cursed him, in his hearing, before
everybody, and Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, the captain of the host,
wished to cut off his head and avenge the insult to the king, the
blessed David moved with pious wrath against this dreadful suggestion of
his, and keeping the due measure of humility and a strict patience, said
with imperturbable gentleness, “What have I to do with you, ye sons of
Zeruiah? Let him alone that he may curse. For the Lord hath commanded
him to curse David. And who is he who shall dare to say, Why hast thou
done this? Behold my son, who came forth from my loins, seeks my life,
and how much more this son of Benjamin? Let him alone, that he may
curse, according to the command of the Lord. It may be the Lord will
look upon my affliction, and return to me good for this cursing
to-day.” <span id="fr_931"></span>[932](#fn_931.md)
