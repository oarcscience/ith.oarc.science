#### <span id="ii.vi.i.xlvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XLVII.

<span id="ii.vi.i.xlvii-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.vi.i.xlvii-p1.1"></span>Ozias</span>, then, the son of Amassia,
succeeded to him. For, on the side of the ten tribes, Joas, reaching the
end of his days, had given place to his son Jeroboa, and after him,
again, his son Zacharias began to reign. Of these kings, and of all who
ruled over Samaria on the side of the ten tribes, we have not thought it
necessary to note the dates, because, aiming at brevity, we have omitted
everything superfluous; and we have thought that the years should be
carefully traced for a knowledge especially of the times of that
portion <span id="fr_322"></span>[323](#fn_322) of the Jews, which being
carried into captivity at a later period than the other, passed through
a longer time as a kingdom. Ozias, then, having obtained the kingdom of
Judah, gave his principal care to knowing the Lord, making great use of
Zachariah the prophet (Isaiah, too, is said to have first prophesied
under this king); and, on this account, he carried on war against his
neighbors with deservedly prosperous results, while he also conquered
the Arabians. And already he had shaken Egypt with the terror of his
name; but, being elated by prosperity, he ventured on what was
forbidden, and offered incense to God, a thing which it was the
established custom for the priests alone to do. Being, then, rebuked by
Azaria the priest, and compelled to leave the sacred place, he burst out
into a rage, but was, when he finally withdrew, covered with leprosy.
Under the influence of this disease he ended his <span id="page_94">p.
94</span> <span id="ii.vi.i.xlvii-Page_94"></span>days, after having
reigned fifty-two years. Then the kingdom was given to Joathas his son;
and he is related to have been very pious, and carried on the government
with success: he subdued in war the nation of the Ammonites, and
compelled them to pay tribute. He reigned sixteen years, and his son
Achaz succeeded him.
