#### <span id="iv.iv.xi.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.

<span id="iv.iv.xi.v-p1"></span>The answer on the heresy described
above.

<span id="iv.iv.xi.v-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.xi.v-p2.1"></span>Isaac</span>: We need not be surprised that
a really simple man who had never received any instruction on the
substance and nature of the Godhead could still be entangled and
deceived by an error of simplicity and the habit of a longstanding
mistake, and (to speak more truly) continue in the original error which
is brought about, not as you suppose by a new illusion of the demons,
but by the ignorance of the ancient heathen world, while in accordance
with the custom of that erroneous notion, by which they used to worship
devils formed in the figure of men, they even now think that the
incomprehensible and ineffable glory of the true Deity should be
worshipped under the limitations of some figure, as they believe that
they can grasp and hold nothing if they have not some image set before
them, which they can continually address while they are at their
devotions, and which they can carry about in their mind and have always
fixed before their eyes. And against this mistake of theirs this text
may be used: “And they changed the glory of the incorruptible God into
the likeness of the image of corruptible man.” <span
id="fr_1664"></span>[1665](#fn_1664) Jeremiah also says: “My people have
changed their glory for an idol. <span
id="fr_1665"></span>[1666](#fn_1665) Which error although by this its
origin, of which we have spoken, it is engrained in the notions of some,
yet none the less is it contracted in the hearts also of those who have
never been stained with the superstition of the heathen world, under the
colour of this passage where it is said “Let us make man after our image
and our likeness,” <span id="fr_1666"></span>[1667](#fn_1666) ignorance
and simplicity being its authors, so that actually there has arisen
owing to this hateful interpretation a heresy called that of the
Anthropomorphites, which maintains with obstinate perverseness that the
infinite and simple substance of the Godhead is fashioned in our
lineaments and human configuration. Which however any one who has been
taught the Catholic doctrine will abhor as heathenish blasphemy, and so
will arrive at that perfectly pure condition in prayer which will not
only not connect with its prayers any figure of the Godhead or bodily
lineaments (which it is a sin even to speak of), but will not even allow
in itself even the memory of a name, or the appearance of an action, or
an outline of any character.
