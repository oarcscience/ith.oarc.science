### <span id="ii.iii.ii-p0.1"></span>Letter II. To the Deacon Aurelius.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p1"></span>Sulpitius has a Vision of St. Martin.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iii.ii-p2.1"></span>Sulpitius Severus</span> to Aurelius the
Deacon sendeth greeting,— <span id="fr_52"></span>[53](#fn_52.md)

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p4"></span>After you had departed from me in the
morning, I was sitting alone in my cell; and there occurred to me, as
often happens, that hope of the future which I cherish, along with a
weariness of the present world, a terror of judgment, a fear of
punishment, and, as a consequence, indeed as the source from which the
whole train of thought had flowed, a remembrance of my sins, which had
rendered me worn and miserable. Then, after I had placed on my couch my
limbs fatigued with the anguish of my mind, sleep crept upon me, as
frequently happens from melancholy; and such sleep, as it is always
somewhat light and uncertain in the morning hours, so it pervaded my
members only in a hovering and doubtful manner. Thus it happens, what
does not occur in a different kind of slumber, that one can feel he is
dreaming while almost awake. In these circumstances, I seemed suddenly
to see St. Martin appear to me in the character of <span id="page_20">p.
20</span> <span id="ii.iii.ii-Page_20"></span>a bishop, clothed in a
white robe, with a countenance as of fire, with eyes like stars, and
with purple hair. <span id="fr_53"></span>[54](#fn_53.md) He thus appeared
to me with that aspect and form of body which I had known, so that I
find it almost difficult to say what I mean—he could not be steadfastly
beheld, though he could be clearly recognized. Well, directing a gentle
smile towards me, he held out in his right hand the small treatise which
I had written concerning his life. I, for my part, embraced his sacred
knees, and begged for his blessing according to custom. Upon this, I
felt his hand placed on my head with the sweetest touch, while, amid the
solemn words of benediction, he repeated again and again the name of the
cross so familiar to his lips. Ere long, while my eyes were earnestly
fixed upon him, and when I could not satisfy myself with gazing upon his
countenance, he was suddenly taken away from me and raised on high. At
last, having passed through the vast expanse of the air, while my
straining eyes followed him ascending in a rapidly moving cloud, he
could no longer be seen by me gazing after him. And not long after, I
saw the holy presbyter Clarus, a disciple of Martin’s who had lately
died, ascend in the same way as I had seen his master. I, impudently
desiring to follow, while I aim at and strive after such lofty steps,
suddenly wake up; and, being roused from sleep, I had begun to rejoice
over the vision, when a boy, a servant in the family, enters to me with
a countenance sadder than is usual with one who gives utterance to his
grief in words. “What,” I enquire of him, “do you wish to tell me with
so melancholy an aspect?” “Two monks,” he replied, “have just been here
from Tours, and they have brought word that Martin is dead.” I confess
that I was cut to the heart; and bursting into tears, I wept most
abundantly. Nay, even now, as I write these things to you, brother, my
tears are flowing, and I find no consolation for my all but unbearable
sorrow. And I should wish you, when this news reaches you, to be a
partaker in my grief, as you were a sharer with me in his love. Come
then, I beg of you, to me without delay, that we may mourn in common him
whom in common we love. And yet I am well aware that such a man ought
not to be mourned over, to whom, after his victory and triumph over the
world, there has now at last been given the crown of righteousness.
Nevertheless, I cannot so command myself as to keep from grieving. I
have, no doubt, sent on before me one who will plead my cause in heaven,
but I have, at the same time, lost my great source of consolation in
this present life; yet if grief would yield to the influence of reason,
I certainly ought to rejoice. For he is now mingling among the Apostles
and Prophets, and (with all respect for the saints on high be it said)
he is second to no one in that assembly of the righteous as I firmly
hope, believe, and trust, being joined especially to those who washed
their robes in the blood of the <span id="fr_54"></span>[55](#fn_54.md)
Lamb. He now follows the Lamb as his guide, free from all spot of
defilement. For although the character <span
id="fr_55"></span>[56](#fn_55.md) of our times could not ensure him the
honor of martyrdom, yet he will not remain destitute of the glory of a
martyr, because both by vow and virtues he was alike able and willing to
be a martyr. But if he had been permitted, in the times of Nero and of
Decius, <span id="fr_56"></span>[57](#fn_56.md) to take part in the
struggle which then went on, I take to witness the God of heaven and
earth that he would freely have submitted <span
id="fr_57"></span>[58](#fn_57.md) to the rack of torture, and readily
surrendered himself to the flames: yea, worthy of being compared to the
illustrious Hebrew youths, amid the circling flames, and though in the
very midst of the furnace, he would have sung a hymn of the Lord. But if
perchance it had pleased the persecutor to inflict upon him the
punishment which Isaiah endured, he would never have shown himself
inferior to the prophet, nor would have shrunk from having his members
torn in pieces by saws and swords. And if impious fury had preferred to
drive the blessed man over precipitous rocks or steep mountains, I
maintain that, clinging <span id="fr_58"></span>[59](#fn_58.md) to the
testimony of truth he would willingly have fallen. But if, after the
example of the teacher of the Gentiles, <span
id="fr_59"></span>[60](#fn_59.md) as indeed often happened, he had been
included among other victims who were condemned <span
id="fr_60"></span>[61](#fn_60.md) to die by the sword, he would have been
foremost to urge on the executioner to his work that he might obtain the
crown <span id="fr_61"></span>[62](#fn_61.md) of blood. And, in truth, far
from shrinking from a confession of the Lord, in the face of all those
penalties and punishments, which frequently prove too much for human
infirmity, he would have stood so immovable as to have smiled with joy
and gladness over the sufferings and torments he endured, whatever might
have been the tortures inflicted upon him. But although he did in fact
suffer none of these things, yet he fully attained to the honor of
martyrdom without shedding his blood. For what agonies of human
sufferings did he not endure in behalf of the hope of eternal life, in
hunger, in watchings, in nakedness, in fastings, <span id="page_21">p.
21</span> <span id="ii.iii.ii-Page_21"></span>in reproachings of the
malignant, in persecutions of the wicked, in care for the weak, in
anxiety for those in danger? For who ever suffered but Martin suffered
along with him? Who was made to stumble and he burnt not? Who perished,
and he did not mourn deeply? Besides those daily struggles which he
carried on against the various conflicts with human and spiritual
wickedness, while invariably, as he was assailed with divers
temptations, there prevailed in his case fortitude in conquering,
patience in waiting, and placidity in enduring. O man, truly
indescribable in piety, mercy, love, which daily grows cold even in holy
men through the coldness of the world, but which in his case increased
onwards to the end, and endured from day to day! I, for my part, had the
happiness of enjoying this grace in him even in an eminent degree, for
he loved me in a special manner, though I was far from meriting such
affection. And, on the remembrance, yet again my tears burst forth,
while groans issue from the bottom of my heart. In what man shall I for
the future find such repose for my spirit as I did in him? and in whose
love shall I enjoy like consolation? Wretched being that I am, sunk in
affliction, can I ever, if life be spared me, cease to lament that I
have survived Martin? Shall there in future be to me any pleasure in
life, or any day or hour free from tears; or can I ever, my dearest
brother, make mention of him to you without lamentation? And yet, in
conversing with you, can I ever talk of any other subject than him? But
why do I stir you up to tears and lamentations? So I now desire you to
be comforted, although I am unable to console myself. He will not be
absent from us; believe me, he will never, never forsake us, but will be
present with us as we discourse regarding him, and will be near to us as
we pray; and the happiness which he has even to-day deigned to bestow,
even that of seeing him in his glory, he will frequently in future
afford; and he will protect us, as he did but a little while ago, with
his unceasing benediction. Then again, according to the arrangement of
the vision, he showed that heaven was open to those following him, and
taught us to what we ought to follow him; he instructed us to what
objects our hope should be directed, and to what attainment our mind
should be turned. Yet, my brother, what is to be done? For, as I am
myself well aware, I shall never be able to climb that difficult ascent,
and penetrate into those blessed regions. To such a degree does a
miserable burden press me down; and while I cannot, through the load of
sin which overwhelms me, secure an ascent to heaven, the cruel pressure
rather sinks me in my misery to the place of despair. <span
id="fr_62"></span>[63](#fn_62.md) Nevertheless, hope remains, one last and
solitary hope, that, what I cannot obtain of myself, I may, at any rate,
be thought worthy of, through the prayers of Martin in my behalf. But
why, brother, should I longer occupy your time with a letter which has
turned out so garrulous, and thus delay you from coming to me? At the
same time, my page being now filled, can admit no more. This, however,
was my object in prolonging my discourse to a somewhat undue extent,
that, since this letter conveys to you a message of sorrow, it might
also furnish you with consolation, through my sort of friendly
conversation with you.
