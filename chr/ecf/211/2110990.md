#### <span id="iv.vi.iv.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.

<span id="iv.vi.iv.iii-p1"></span>A question on the end of penitence and
the marks of satisfaction.

<span id="iv.vi.iv.iii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.iii-p2.1"></span>As</span> your grand and splendid
exposition of a doctrine new to us has opened out to us a more difficult
road to the most glorious re<span id="page_498">p. 498</span> <span
id="iv.vi.iv.iii-Page_498"></span>nunciation, and has removed the scales
from our eyes, and shown to us its summit raised in the heavens, so are
we proportionately cast down with a greater weight of despair. Since,
when we measure its vastness against our puny strength, and compare the
excessively humble character of our ignorance with the boundless height
of virtue shown to us, we feel that we are so small that we not only
cannot attain to it, but that we are sure to fall short in what we have.
For as we are weighed down by the burden of excessive despair, we fall
away somehow from the lowest depths to still lower ones. Accordingly
there is one and only one support which can provide a cure for our
wounds; viz., for us to learn something of the end of penitence and
especially on the marks of satisfaction, that we may feel sure of the
forgiveness of past sins, and so be spurred on to scale the heights of
the perfection described above.
