#### <span id="iv.vii.viii.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VIII.

<span id="iv.vii.viii.viii-p1"></span>The heretics attribute to Christ
only the shadow of Divinity, and so assert that he is to be worshipped
together with God but not as God.

<span id="iv.vii.viii.viii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.viii.viii-p2.1"></span>But</span> still in order to avoid
thinking of the Lord Jesus as one of the whole mass of people, you have
given to Him some glory, by attributing to Him honour as a saint, but
not Deity as true man and true God. For what do you say? “God brought
about the Lord’s Incarnation. Let us honour the form of the
Theodochos <span id="fr_2613"></span>[2614](#fn_2613.md) together with God,
as one form of Godhead, as a figure that cannot be severed from the
Divine link, as an image of the unseen <span id="page_609">p. 609</span>
<span id="iv.vii.viii.viii-Page_609"></span>God.” Above you said that
Adam was the image of God, here you call Christ the image: the one you
speak of as a statue, and the other also as a statue. But I suppose we
ought for God’s honour to be grateful to you, because you grant that the
form of the Theodochos should be worshipped together with God: in which
you wrong Him rather than honour Him. For in this you do not attribute
to the Lord Jesus Christ the glory of Deity, but you deny it. By a
subtle and wicked art you say that He is to be worshipped together with
God in order that you may not have to confess that He is God, and by the
very statement in which you seem deceitfully to join Him with God, you
really sever Him from God. For when you blasphemously say that He is
certainly not to be adored as God, but to be worshipped together with
God, you thus grant to Him an union of nearness to Divinity, in order to
get rid of the truth of His Divinity. Oh, you most wicked and crafty
enemy of God, you want to perpetrate the crime of denying God under
pretext of confessing Him. You say: Let us worship Him as a figure that
cannot be severed from the Divine will, as an image of the unseen God.
It is I suppose, then, owing to His kind acts that our Lord Jesus Christ
has obtained among us honour as Creator and Redeemer. If then we were
redeemed by Him from eternal destruction, in calling our Redeemer a
figure we are endeavouring indeed to respond to His kindness and
goodness, by a worthy service and a worthy allegiance, if we try to get
rid of that glory which He did not refuse to bring low for our sakes.
