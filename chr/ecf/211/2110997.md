#### <span id="iv.vi.iv.x-p0.1"></span>Chapter X.

<span id="iv.vi.iv.x-p1"></span>How the recollection of our sins should
be avoided.

<span id="iv.vi.iv.x-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.x-p2.1"></span>Wherefore</span> we must endeavour to rouse
ourselves to this praiseworthy contrition, by aiming at virtue and by
the desire for the kingdom of heaven rather than by dangerous
recollections of sins, for a man is sure to be suffocated by the
pestilential smells of the sewer as long as he chooses to stand over it
or to stir its filth.
