#### <span id="iv.v.viii.xii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XII.

<span id="iv.v.viii.xii-p1"></span>How a fortunate issue will be of no
avail to evil doers, while bad deeds will not injure good men.

<span id="iv.v.viii.xii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.viii.xii-p2.1"></span>And</span> that we may make these
statements clear by instances from Holy Scripture, what could be brought
about that was more salutary and more to the good of the whole world,
than the saving remedy of the Lord’s Passion? And yet it was not only of
no advantage, but was actually to the disadvantage of the traitor by
whose means it is shown to have been brought about, so that it is
absolutely said of him: “It were good for that man if he had never been
born.” <span id="fr_2017"></span>[2018](#fn_2017.md) For the fruits of his
labour will not be repaid to him according to the actual result, but
according to what he wanted to do, and believed that he would
accomplish. And again, what could there be more culpable than craft and
deceit shown even to a stranger, not to mention one’s brother and
father? And yet the patriarch Jacob not only met with no condemnation or
blame for such things but was actually dowered with the everlasting
heritage of the blessing. And not without reason, for the last mentioned
desired the blessing destined for the first-born not out of a greedy
desire for present gain but because of his faith in everlasting
sanctification; while the former (Judas) delivered the Redeemer of all
to death, not for the sake of man’s salvation, but from the sin of
covetousness. And therefore in each case the fruits of their action are
reckoned according to the intention of the mind and purpose of the will,
according to which the object of the one was not to work fraud, nor was
that of the other to work salvation. For justly is there repayment to
each man as the recompense of reward, for what he conceived in the first
instance in his mind, and not for what resulted from it either well or
badly, against the wish of the worker. And so the most just Judge
regarded him who ventured on such a falsehood as excusable and indeed
worthy of praise, because without it he could not secure the blessing of
the first-born; and that should not be reckoned as a sin, which arose
from desire of the blessing. Otherwise the aforesaid patriarch would
have been not only unfair to his brother, but also a cheat of his father
and a blasphemer, if there had been any other way by which he could
secure the gift of that blessing, and he had preferred to follow this
which would damage and injure his brother. You see then that with God
the inquiry is not into the carrying out of the act, but into the
purpose of the mind. With this preparation then for a return to the
question proposed (for which all this has been premised) I want you
first to tell me for what reason you bound yourselves in the fetters of
that promise.
