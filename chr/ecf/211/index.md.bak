Divinity of Christ.](2111124.md)

Son of God.](2111126.md)  
[Chapter VI. That there is in Christ but one Hypostasis (i.e., Personal
self).](2111127.md)  
[Chapter VII. He returns to the former subject, in order to show against
the Nestorians that those things are said of the man, which belong to
the Divine nature as it were of a Person of Divine nature, and
conversely that those things are said of God, which belong to the human
nature as it were of a Person of human nature, because there is in
Christ but one and a single Personal self.](2111128.md)

[Chapter IX. He corroborates this statement by the authority of the old

[Chapter VIII. He confirms the judgment of the Apostle by the authority
of the Lord.](2111143.md)

of Antioch.](2111157.md)

who declare that He was a mere man.](2111163.md)  
[Chapter XIII. He replies to the objection in which they say that the
child born ought to be of one substance with the mother.](2111164.md)  
[Chapter XIV. He compares this erroneous view with the teaching of the
Pelagians.](2111165.md)  
[Chapter XV. He shows that those who patronize this false teaching
acknowledge two Christs.](2111166.md)  
[Chapter XVI. He shows further that this teaching is destructive of the
confession of the Trinity.](2111167.md)

religion, lose the whole faith, and all the value of the
faith.](2111168.md)

glory and power of His Deity.](2111170.md)

[Chapter XXI. The authority of Holy Scripture teaches that Christ
existed from all eternity.](2111172.md)

the whole, is very familiar to the Holy Scripture.](2111174.md)  
[Book VII.](2111175.md)  
[Chapter I. As he is going to reply to the slanders of his opponents he
implores the aid of Divine grace to teach a prayer to be used by those

[Chapter III. He replies to the cavil that the one who is born must be
of one substance with the one who bears.](2111178.md)  
[Chapter IV. How God has shown His Omnipotence in His birth in time as
well as in everything else.](2111179.md)  
[Chapter V. He shows by proofs drawn from nature itself, that the law

substance with the one who bears, fails to hold good in many
cases.](2111180.md)  
[Chapter VI. He refutes another argument of Nestorius, in which he tried

secret, since it was clearly shown even to the patriarch

[Chapter XI. How the devil was forced by many reasons to the view that
Christ was God.](2111186.md)  
[Chapter XII. He compares this notion and reasonable suspicion of the
devil with the obstinate and inflexible idea of his opponents, and shows
that this last is worse and more blasphemous than the
former.](2111187.md)  
[Chapter XIII. How the devil always retained this notion of Christ's
Divinity (because of His secret working which he experienced) even up to
His Cross and Death.](2111188.md)  
[Chapter XIV. He shows how heretics pervert holy Scripture, by replying
to the argument drawn from the Apostle's words, “Without father, without
mother,” etc.: Heb. vii.](2111189.md)  
[Chapter XV. How Christ could be said by the Apostle to be without
genealogy.](2111190.md)  
[Chapter XVI. He shows that like the devil when tempting Christ, the
heretics garble and pervert holy Scripture.](2111191.md)  
[Chapter XVII. That the glory and honour of Christ is not to be ascribed
to the Holy Ghost in such a way as to deny that it proceeds from Christ
Himself, as if all that excellency, which was in Him, was another's and
proceeded from another source.](2111192.md)  
[Chapter XVIII. How we are to understand the Apostle's words: “He
appeared in the flesh, was justified in the Spirit,” etc.](2111193.md)  
[Chapter XIX. That it was not only the Spirit, but Christ Himself also
who made Him to be feared.](2111194.md)  
[Chapter XX. He tries by stronger and weightier arguments to destroy
that notion.](2111195.md)  
[Chapter XXI. That it must be ascribed equally to Christ and the Holy
Ghost that His flesh and Humanity became the temple of God.](2111196.md)  
[Chapter XXII. That the raising up of Christ into heaven is not to be
ascribed to the Spirit alone.](2111197.md)  
[Chapter XXIII. He continues the same argument to show that Christ had
no need of another's glory as He had a glory of His own.](2111198.md)

Hilary.](2111199.md)

Augustine.](2111202.md)

Eastern Bishops, he brings forward in the first place S. Gregory
Nazianzen.](2111203.md)
