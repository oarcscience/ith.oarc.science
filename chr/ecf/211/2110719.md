#### <span id="iv.iv.viii.x-p0.1"></span>Chapter X.

<span id="iv.iv.viii.x-p1"></span>The answer how unclean spirits are
united with human souls.

<span id="iv.iv.viii.x-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.viii.x-p2.1"></span>Serenus</span>: It is no wonder that
spirit can be imperceptibly joined with spirit, and exercise an unseen
power of persuasion toward what is allowed to it. For there is between
them (just as between men) some sort of similarity and kinship of
substance, since the description which is given of the nature of the
soul, applies equally well to their substance. But it is impossible for
spirits to be implanted in spirits inwardly or united with them in such
a way that one can hold the other; for this is the true prerogative of
Deity alone, which is the only simple and incorporeal nature.

in or united with the souls of those whom they have filled.](2110720)
