#### <span id="iv.iii.v.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.

<span id="iv.iii.v.v-p1"></span>That one and the same rule of fasting
cannot be observed by everybody.

<span id="iv.iii.v.v-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.v.v-p2.1"></span>And</span> so on the manner of fasting a
uniform rule cannot easily be observed, because everybody has not the
same strength; nor is it like the rest of the virtues, acquired by
steadfastness of mind alone. And therefore, because it does not depend
only on mental firmness, since it has to do with the possibilities of
the body, we have received this explanation concerning it which has been
handed down to us, viz.: that there is a difference of time, manner, and
quality of the refreshment in proportion to the difference of condition
of the body, the age, and sex: but that there is one and the same rule
of restraint to everybody as regards continence of mind, and the virtue
of the spirit. For it is impossible for every one to prolong his fast
for a week, or to postpone taking refreshment during a two or three
days’ abstinence. By many people also who are worn out with sickness and
especially with old age, a fast even up to sunset cannot be endured
without suffering. The sickly food of moistened beans does not agree
with everybody: nor does a sparing diet of fresh vegetables suit all,
nor is a scanty meal of dry bread permitted to all alike. One man does
not feel satisfied with two pounds, for another a meal of one pound, or
six ounces, is too much; but there is one aim and object of continence
in the case of all of these, viz.: that no one may be overburdened
beyond the measure of his appetite, by gluttony. For it is not only the
quality, but also the quantity of food taken which dulls the keenness of
the mind, and when the soul as well as the flesh is surfeited, kindles
the baneful and fiery incentive to vice.
