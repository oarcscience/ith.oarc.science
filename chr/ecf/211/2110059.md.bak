#### <span id="ii.iv.i.xxii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXII.

<span id="ii.iv.i.xxii-p1"></span>“<span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.i.xxii-p1.1"></span>A certain</span> young man from Asia,
exceedingly wealthy, of distinguished family, and having a wife and
little son, happening to have been a tribune in Egypt, and in frequent
campaigns against the Blembi to have touched on some parts of the
desert, and having also seen several tents of the saints, heard the word
of salvation from the blessed John. And he did not then delay to show
his contempt for an unprofitable military life with its vain honor.
Bravely entering into the wilderness, he in a short time became
distinguished as being perfect in every kind of virtue. Capable of
lengthened fasting, conspicuous for humility, and steadfast in faith, he
had easily obtained a reputation in the pursuit <span id="page_35">p.
35</span> <span id="ii.iv.i.xxii-Page_35"></span>of virtue equal to that
of the monks of old. But by and by, the thought (proceeding from the
devil) entered his mind that it would be more proper for him to return
to his native land and be the means of saving his only son and his
family along with his wife; which surely would be more acceptable to God
than if he, content with only rescuing himself from the world, should,
not without impiety, neglect the salvation of his friends. Overcome by
the plausible appearance of that kind of spurious righteousness, the
recluse, after a period of nearly four years, forsook his cell and the
end to which he had devoted his life. But on arriving at the nearest
monastery, which was inhabited by many brethren, he made known to them,
in reply to their questionings, the reason of his departure and the
object he had in view. All of them, and especially the Abbot of that
place, sought to keep him back; but the intention he had unfortunately
formed could not be rooted out of his mind. Accordingly with an unhappy
obstinacy he went forth, and, to the grief of all, departed from the
brethren. But scarcely had he vanished from their sight, when he was
taken possession of by a demon, and vomiting bloody froth from his
mouth, he began to lacerate himself with his own teeth. Then, having
been carried back to the same monastery on the shoulders of the
brethren, when the unclean spirit could not be restrained within its
walls, he was, from dire necessity, loaded with iron fetters, being
bound both in hands and feet—a punishment not undeserved by a fugitive,
inasmuch as chains now restrained him whom faith had not restrained. At
length, after two years, having been set free from the unclean spirit by
the prayers of the saints, he immediately returned to the desert from
which he had departed. In this way he was both himself corrected and was
rendered a warning to others, that the shadow of a spurious
righteousness might neither delude any one, nor a shifting fickleness of
character induce any one, with unprofitable inconstancy, to forsake the
course on which he has once entered. And now let it suffice for you to
learn these things respecting the various operations of the Lord which
he has carried on in the persons of his servants; with the view either
of stimulating others to a like kind of conduct, or of deterring them
from particular actions. But since I have by this time fully satisfied
your ears—have, in fact, been more lengthy than I ought to have been—do
you now (upon this he addressed himself to me)—pay me the recompense you
owe, by letting us hear you, after your usual fashion, discoursing about
your friend Martin, for my longings after this have already for a long
time been strongly excited.”
