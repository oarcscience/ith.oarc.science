#### <span id="iv.iv.vi.xxiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXIII.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.xxiii-p1"></span>How it is useful for us to take
possession of their lands.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.xxiii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.vi.xxiii-p2.1"></span>But</span> the fact that we are bidden
for our good to take possession of the countries of those most wicked
nations, may be understood in this way. Each fault has its own especial
corner in the heart, which it claims for itself in the recesses of the
soul, and drives out Israel, i.e., the contemplation of holy and
heavenly things, and never ceases to oppose them. For virtues cannot
possibly live side by side with faults. “For what participation hath
righteousness with unrighteousness? Or what fellowship hath light with
darkness?” <span id="fr_1356"></span>[1357](#fn_1356.md) But as <span
id="page_350">p. 350</span> <span
id="iv.iv.vi.xxiii-Page_350"></span>soon as these faults have been
overcome by the people of Israel, i.e., by those virtues which war
against them, then at once the place in our heart which the spirit of
concupiscence and fornication had occupied, will be filled by chastity.
That which wrath had held, will be claimed by patience. That which had
been occupied by a sorrow that worketh death, will be taken by a godly
sorrow and one full of joy. That which had been wasted by accidie, will
at once be tilled by courage. That which pride had trodden down will be
ennobled by humility: and so when each of these faults has been
expelled, their places (that is the tendency towards them) will be
filled by the opposite virtues which are aptly termed the children of
Israel, that is, of the soul that seeth God: <span
id="fr_1357"></span>[1358](#fn_1357.md) and when these have expelled all
passions from the heart we may believe that they have recovered their
own possessions rather than invaded those of others.
