#### <span id="ii.vi.i.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.

<span id="ii.vi.i.ix-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.vi.i.ix-p1.1"></span>Laban</span> had two daughters, Leah and
Rachel; but Leah had tender eyes, while Rachel is said to have been
beautiful. Jacob, captivated by her beauty, burned with love for the
virgin, and, asking her in marriage from the father, gave himself up to
a servitude of seven years. But when the time was fulfilled, Leah was
foisted upon him, and he was subjected to another servitude of seven
years, after which Rachel was given him. But we are told that she was
long barren, while Leah was fruitful. Of the sons whom Jacob had by
Leah, the following are the names: Reuben, Symeon, Levi, Judah,
Issachar, Zebulon, and a daughter Dinah; while there were born to him by
the handmaid of Leah, Gad and Asher, and by the handmaid of Rachel, Dan
and Naphtali. But Rachel, after she had despaired of offspring, bare
Joseph. Then Jacob, being desirous of returning to his father, when
Laban his father-in-law had given him a portion of the flock as a reward
for his service, and Jacob the son-in-law, thinking him not to be acting
justly in that matter, while he \[also\] suspected deceit on his part,
privately departed about the thirtieth year after his arrival. Rachel,
without the knowledge of her husband, stole the idols <span
id="fr_261"></span>[262](#fn_261.md) of her father, and on account of this
injury Laban followed his son-in-law, but not finding his idols,
returned, after being reconciled, having straitly charged his son-in-law
not to take other wives in addition to his daughters. Then Jacob, going
on his way, is said to have had a vision of angels and of the army <span
id="fr_262"></span>[263](#fn_262.md) of the Lord. But, as he directed his
journey past the region of Edom, which his brother Esau inhabited,
suspecting the temper of Esau, he first sent messengers and gifts to try
him. Then he went to meet his brother, but Jacob took care not to trust
him beyond what he could help. On the day before the brothers were to
meet, God, taking a human form, is said to have wrestled with Jacob. And
when he had prevailed with God, still he was not ignorant that his
adversary was no mere mortal; and therefore begged to be blessed by him.
Then his name was changed by God, so that from Jacob he was called
Israel. But when he, in turn, inquired of God the name of God, he was
told that that should not be asked after because it was wonderful. <span
id="fr_263"></span>[264](#fn_263.md) Moreover, from that wrestling, the
breadth <span id="fr_264"></span>[265](#fn_264.md) of Jacob’s thigh shrank.

the Hebrew word *Teraphim*. Perhaps the original word should simply be
transliterated into English as has been done in the Revised Version.
