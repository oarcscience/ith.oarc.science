#### <span id="iv.iii.iv.xxi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXI.

<span id="iv.iii.iv.xxi-p1"></span>Of the spontaneous service of some of
the brethren.

<span id="iv.iii.iv.xxi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.iv.xxi-p2.1"></span>We</span> have been told of brethren in
whose week there was such a scarcity of wood that they had not enough to
prepare the usual food for the brethren; and when it had been ordered by
the Abbot’s authority that until more could be brought and fetched, they
should content themselves with dried food, <span
id="fr_777"></span>[778](#fn_777.md) though this was agreed to by all and
no one could expect any cooked food; still these men as if they were
cheated of the fruit and reward of their labour and service, if they did
not prepare the food for their brethren according to custom in the order
of their turn—imposed upon themselves such uncalled-for labour and care
that in those dry and sterile regions where wood cannot possibly be
procured unless it is cut from the fruit trees (for there are no wild
shrubs found there as with us), they wander about through the wide
deserts, and traversing the wilderness which stretches towards the Dead
Sea, <span id="fr_778"></span>[779](#fn_778.md) collect in their lap and
the folds of their dress the scanty stubble and brambles which the wind
carries hither and thither, and so by their voluntary service prepare
all their usual food for the brethren, so that they suffer nothing to be
diminished of the ordinary supply; discharging these duties of theirs
towards their brethren with such fidelity that though the scarcity of
wood and the <span id="page_226">p. 226</span> <span
id="iv.iii.iv.xxi-Page_226"></span>Abbot’s order would be a fair excuse
for them, yet still out of regard for their profit and reward they will
not take advantage of this liberty.

<span id="iv.iii.iv.xxi-p3"></span> *Xerophagia* (<span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.iii.iv.xxi-p3.1"></span>ξηροφαγία</span>),
*“dried food,”* distinguished from what is raw (*omophagia*) in the next
chapter. Cf. for the word, Tertullian on Fasting c. i. and xvii.

<span id="iv.iii.iv.xxi-p4"></span> This shows that Cassian is here
writing about the monks of Palestine, not those of Egypt, who (according
to the next chapter) had a permanent cook. There is a further allusion
to and description of this desert in the Conference VI. i.
