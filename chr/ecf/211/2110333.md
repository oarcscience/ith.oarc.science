agree to take from him money to be used even for the <span

of the monastery: First, in case he may be puffed up with arrogance,
owing to this offering, and so not deign to put himself on a level with
the poorer brethren; and next, lest he fail through this pride of his to
stoop to the humility of Christ, and so, when he cannot hold out under
the discipline of the monastery, leave it, and afterwards, when he has
cooled down, want in a bad spirit to receive and get back—not without
loss to the monastery—what he had contributed in the early days of his
renunciation, when he was aglow with spiritual fervour. And that this
rule should always be kept they have been frequently taught by many
instances. For in some monasteries where they are not so careful some
who have been received unreservedly have afterwards tried most
sacrilegiously to demand a return of that which they had contributed and
which had been spent on God’s work.

are received in the monasteries, must lay aside their own clothes and be
clothed in others by the Abbot.](2110334.md)
