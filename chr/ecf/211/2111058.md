#### <span id="iv.vi.vii.xx-p0.1"></span>Chapter XX.

<span id="iv.vi.vii.xx-p1"></span>From whom we can learn the destruction
of sin and perfection of goodness.

<span id="iv.vi.vii.xx-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.vii.xx-p2.1"></span>Lastly</span> if you would like to
investigate more thoroughly whether it is possible for human nature to
attain sinlessness, from whom can we more clearly learn this than from
those who “have crucified the flesh with its faults and lusts,” and to
whom “the world is really crucified”? <span
id="fr_2290"></span>[2291](#fn_2290) Who though they have not only
utterly eradicated all faults from their hearts, but also are trying to
shut out even the thought and recollection of sin, yet still day after
day faithfully maintain that they cannot even for a single hour be free
from spot of sin.
