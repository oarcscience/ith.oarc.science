#### <span id="iv.iv.vii.xvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVI.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xvi-p1"></span>How even celestial powers above are
capable of change.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xvi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.vii.xvi-p2.1"></span>But</span> that even the powers above
are, as we said, subject to change is shown by those who fell from their
ranks through the fault of a corrupt will. Wherefore we ought not to
think that the nature of those is unchangeable, who remain in the
blessed condition in which they were created, simply because they were
not in like manner led astray to choose the worse part. For it is one
thing to have a nature incapable of change, and another thing for a man
through the efforts of his virtue, and by guarding what is good through
the grace of the unchangeable God, to be kept from change. For
everything that is secured or preserved by care, can also be lost by
carelessness. And so we read: “Call no man blessed before his
death,” <span id="fr_1431"></span>[1432](#fn_1431.md) because so long as a
man is still engaged in the struggle, and if I may use the expression,
still wrestling—even though he generally conquers and carries off many
prizes of victory,—yet he can never be free from fear, and from the
suspicion of an uncertain issue. And therefore God alone is called
unchangeable and good, as His goodness is not the result of effort, but
a natural possession, and so He cannot be anything but good. No virtue
then can be acquired by man without the possibility of change, but in
order that when it once exists it may be continually preserved, it must
be watched over with the same care and diligence with which it was
acquired.
