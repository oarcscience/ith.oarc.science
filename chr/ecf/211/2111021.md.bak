#### <span id="iv.vi.v.xxi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXI.

<span id="iv.vi.v.xxi-p1"></span>A question whether the relaxation of
the fast is not prejudicial to the chastity of the body.

<span id="iv.vi.v.xxi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.v.xxi-p2.1"></span>Germanus</span>: Can the flesh, attracted
by the unwonted luxuries of so long a festival fail to produce something
thorny from the incentives to sin although they have been cut down? or
can the soul weighed down by the consumption of unaccustomed feasts fail
to mitigate the rigour of its rule over its servant the body, especially
when in our case our mature age can excite our subject members to a
speedy revolt, if we venture to take our usual food in larger
quantities, or unaccustomed food more freely than usual?
