#### <span id="iv.v.ii.x-p0.1"></span>Chapter X.

<span id="iv.v.ii.x-p1"></span>How it is the perfection of love to pray
for one’s enemies and by what signs we may recognize a mind that is not
yet purified.

<span id="iv.v.ii.x-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.ii.x-p2.1"></span>When</span> then any one has acquired this
love of goodness of which we have been speaking, and the imitation of
God, then he will be endowed with the Lord’s heart of compassion, and
will pray also for his persecutors, saying in like manner: “Father,
forgive them, for they know not what they do.” <span
id="fr_1711"></span>[1712](#fn_1711) But it is a clear sign of a soul
that is not yet thoroughly purged from the dregs of sin, not to sorrow
with a feeling of pity at the offences of others, but to keep to the
rigid censure of the judge: for how will he be able to obtain perfection
of heart, who is without that by which, as the Apostle has pointed out,
the full requirements of the law can be fulfilled, saying: “Bear one
another’s burdens and so fulfil the law of Christ,” <span
id="fr_1712"></span>[1713](#fn_1712) and who has not that virtue of
love, which “is not grieved, is not puffed up, thinketh no evil,” which
“endureth all things, beareth all things.” <span
id="fr_1713"></span>[1714](#fn_1713) For “a righteous man pitieth the
life of his beasts: but the heart of the ungodly is without pity.” <span
id="fr_1714"></span>[1715](#fn_1714) And so a monk is quite certain to
fall into the same sins which he condemns in another with merciless and
inhuman severity, for “a stern king will fall into misfortunes,” and
“one who stops his ears so as not to hear the weak, shall himself cry,
and there shall be none to hear him.” <span
id="fr_1715"></span>[1716](#fn_1715)
