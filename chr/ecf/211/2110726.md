#### <span id="iv.iv.viii.xvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVII.

<span id="iv.iv.viii.xvii-p1"></span>On the fact that not every devil
has the power of suggesting every passion to men.

<span id="iv.iv.viii.xvii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.viii.xvii-p2.1"></span>But</span> we ought to know this, that
not all devils can implant all the passions in men, but that certain
spirits brood over each sin, and that some gloat over uncleanness and
filthy lusts, others over blasphemy, others are more particularly
devoted to anger and wrath, others thrive on gloominess, others are
pacified with vainglory and pride; and each one implants in the hearts
of men that sin, in which he himself revels, and they cannot implant
their special vices all at one time, but in turn, according as the
opportunity of time or place, or a man, who is open to their
suggestions, excites them.
