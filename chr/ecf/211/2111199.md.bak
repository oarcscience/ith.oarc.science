#### <span id="iv.vii.viii.xxiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXIV.

<span id="iv.vii.viii.xxiv-p1"></span>He supports this doctrine by the
authority of the blessed Hilary.

<span id="iv.vii.viii.xxiv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.viii.xxiv-p2.1"></span>But</span> it is quite time to finish
the book, aye and the whole work, if I may however add the sayings of a
few saintly men and illustrious priests, to support by the faith of the
present day what we have already proved by the authority of holy
Scripture. Hilary, a man endowed with all virtues and graces, and famous
for his life as well as for his eloquence, who also, as a teacher of the
churches and a priest, advanced not only by his own merits but also by
the progress of others, and remained so steadfast during the storms of
persecution that through the fortitude of his unconquered faith he
attained the dignity of being a Confessor, <span
id="fr_2660"></span>[2661](#fn_2660.md) —he testifies in the First book on
the faith that the Lord Jesus Christ, Very God of Very God, was both
begotten before the world, and afterwards born as man. Again in the
Second book: “One only Begotten God grew in the womb of the holy Virgin
into the form of a human body; He who contains all things, and in whose
power all things are, is brought forth according to the law of human
birth.” Again in the same book: “An angel is witness that He who is born
is God with us.” Again in the Tenth book: “We have taught the mystery of
God born as man by the birth from the Virgin.” Again in the same book:
“For when God was born as man, He was not born on purpose not to remain
God.” <span id="fr_2661"></span>[2662](#fn_2661.md) Again in the same
writer’s preface to his exposition of the gospel according to
Matthew: <span id="fr_2662"></span>[2663](#fn_2662.md) “For to begin with
it was needful for us that for our sakes the only Begotten God should be
known to be born as man.” Again in what follows: “that besides being
God, He should be born as man, which He was not yet.” Again in the same
place: “Then this third matter was fitting: that as God was born as man
in the world” etc.: Here are a few passages out of any number. But still
you see even from these which we have quoted, how clearly and plainly he
asserts that God was born of Mary. And where then is this saying of
yours: “The creature could not bring forth the Creator: and that which
is born of the flesh, is flesh.” It would take too long to quote
passages bearing on this point from each separate writer. I must try to
enumerate them rather than to explain them: for they will sufficiently
explain themselves.

Emperor Constantius in 356, because of his resolute defense of the
Nicene faith against Arianism.
