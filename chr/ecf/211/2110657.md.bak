<span id="iv.iv.v.xvi-p1"></span>Of the excitements of the flesh,
without the humiliation of which we should fall more grievously.

<span id="iv.iv.v.xvi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.v.xvi-p2.1"></span>To</span> the fact then that the pride
which results from this purity would be more dangerous than all sins and
wickednesses, and that we should on that account gain no reward for any
height of perfect chastity, we may call as witnesses those powers of
which we spoke before, which since it is believed that they experience
no such fleshly lusts, were cast down from their high and heavenly
estate in everlasting destruction simply from pride of heart. And so we
should be altogether hopelessly lukewarm, since we should have no
warning of carelessness on our part implanted either in our body or in
our mind, nor should we ever strive to reach the glow of perfection, or
even keep to strict frugality and abstinence, were it not that this
excitement of the flesh springs up and humbles us and baffles us and
makes us keen and anxious about purifying ourselves from spiritual sins.
