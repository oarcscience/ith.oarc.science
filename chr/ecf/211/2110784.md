<span id="iv.iv.x.xiv-p1"></span>Of Thanksgiving.

<span id="iv.iv.x.xiv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.x.xiv-p2.1"></span>Then</span> in the fourth place there stand
thanksgivings which the mind in ineffable transports offers up to God,
either when it recalls God’s past benefits or when it contemplates His
present ones, or when it looks forward to those great ones in the future
which God has prepared for them that love Him. And with this purpose too
sometimes we are wont to pour forth richer prayers, while, as we gaze
with pure eyes on those rewards of the saints which are laid up in store
hereafter, our spirit is stimulated to offer up unspeakable thanks to
God with boundless joy.
