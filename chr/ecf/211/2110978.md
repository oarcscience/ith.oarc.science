<span id="iv.vi.iii.viii"></span>

#### <span id="iv.vi.iii.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VIII.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.viii-p1"></span>The answer to the question proposed.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.viii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.viii-p2.1"></span>John</span>: I should absolutely
maintain that one and the same man could not attain perfection in both
lives unless I was hindered by the example of some few. And since it is
no small matter to find a man who is perfect in either of them, it is
clear how much harder and I had almost said impossible it is for a man
to be thoroughly efficient in both. And if this has ever happened, it
cannot come under any general rule. For a general rule must be based not
on exceptional instances, i.e., on the experience of a very few, but on
what is within the power of the many or rather of all. But what is
attained to here and there by but one or two, and is beyond the capacity
of ordinary goodness, must be kept out of general rules as something
permitted outside the condition and nature of human weakness, and should
be brought forward as a miracle rather than as an example. Wherefore I
will, as my slender ability allows, briefly intimate what you want to
know. The aim indeed of the Cœnobite is to mortify and crucify all his
desires and, according to that salutary command of evangelic perfection,
to take no thought for the morrow. And it is perfectly clear that this
perfection cannot be attained by any except a Cœnobite, such a man as
the prophet Isaiah describes and blesses and praises as follows: “If
thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy own will in my
holy day, and glorify Him, while thou dost not thine own ways, and thine
own will is not found to speak a word: then shalt thou be delighted in
the Lord, and I will lift thee up above the high places of the earth,
and will feed thee with the inheritance of Jacob thy father. For the
mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.” <span
id="fr_2111"></span>[2112](#fn_2111.md) But the perfection for a hermit is
to have his mind freed from all earthly things, and to unite it, as far
as human frailty allows, with Christ: and such a man the prophet
Jeremiah describes when he says: “Blessed is the man who hath borne the
<span id="page_493">p. 493</span> <span
id="iv.vi.iii.viii-Page_493"></span>yoke from his youth. He shall sit
solitary and hold his peace, because he hath taken it upon himself;” the
Psalmist also: “I am become like a pelican in the desert. I watched and
became as a sparrow alone upon the housetop.” <span
id="fr_2112"></span>[2113](#fn_2112.md) To this aim then, which we have
described as that of either life, unless each of them attains, in vain
does the one adopt the system of the Cœnobium, and the other of the
hermitage: for neither of them will get the good of his method of life.
