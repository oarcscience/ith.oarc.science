#### <span id="iv.vi.viii.i-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.

<span id="iv.vi.viii.i-p1"></span>How we laid bare the secrets of our
thoughts to Abbot Abraham.

<span id="iv.vi.viii.i-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.viii.i-p2.1"></span>This</span> twenty-fourth Conference of
Abbot Abraham <span id="fr_2291"></span>[2292](#fn_2291.md) is by the
favour of Christ produced, which concludes the traditions and decisions
of all the Elders; and when by the aid of your prayers it has been
finished, as the number mystically corresponds to that of the four and
twenty Elders who are said in the holy Apocalypse <span
id="fr_2292"></span>[2293](#fn_2292.md) to offer their crowns to the Lamb,
we think that we shall have paid the debt of all our promises. And
henceforth if these four and twenty Elders of ours have been crowned
with any glory for the sake of their teaching, they shall with bowed
heads offer it to the Lamb who was slain for the salvation of the world:
for He it was Who vouchsafed <span id="page_532">p. 532</span> <span
id="iv.vi.viii.i-Page_532"></span>for the honour of His name to grant to
them such exalted feelings and to us whatever words were needful to set
forth such profound thoughts. And the merits of His gift must be
referred to the Author of all good, to whom the more is owed, as the
more is paid. Therefore with anxious confession we laid before this
Abraham the impulse of our thoughts, whereby we were urged by daily
perplexities of our mind to return to our country and revisit our
kinsfolk. For from this the greatest reason for our desire sprang,
because we remembered that our kinsfolk were endowed with such piety and
goodness that we felt sure that they would never interfere with our
purpose, and we constantly reflected, that we should gain more good out
of their earnestness, and should be hampered by no cares about bodily
matters, and no trouble in providing food, as they would gladly minister
abundantly to the supply of all our wants, and besides this we were
feeding our souls on the hope of empty joys, as we thought that we
should gain the greatest good from the conversion <span
id="fr_2293"></span>[2294](#fn_2293.md) of many, who were to be turned to
the way of salvation by our example and instructions. Then besides this
the very spot, where was the ancestral possession of our forefathers,
and the delightful pleasantness of the neighbourhood was painted before
our eyes, how pleasantly and suitably it stretched away to the desert,
so that the recesses of the woods would not only delight the heart of a
monk, but would also furnish him with a plentiful supply of food. <span
id="fr_2294"></span>[2295](#fn_2294.md) And when we explained all this to
the aforesaid old man, in a straightforward way, according to the faith
of our conscience, and showed by our copious tears that we could no
longer resist the violence of the impulse, unless the grace of God came
to our rescue by the healing which he could give, he waited for a long
time in silence and at last sighed deeply and said:
