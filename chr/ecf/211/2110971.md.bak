#### <span id="iv.vi.iii.i-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.i-p1"></span>Of the Cœnobium of Abbot Paul and the
patience of a certain brother.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.i-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.i-p2.1"></span>After</span> only a few days we made our
way once more with great alacrity, drawn by the desire for further
instruction, to the Cœnobium of Abbot Paul, where though a greater
number than two hundred of the brethren dwell there, yet, in honour of
the festival which was then being held, an enormous collection of monks
from other Cœnobia had come there as well: for the anniversary of the
death <span id="fr_2104"></span>[2105](#fn_2104.md) of a former Abbot who
had presided over the same monastery was being solemnly kept. And we
have mentioned this assembly for this reason that we may briefly treat
of the patience of a certain brother, which was remarkable for immovable
gentleness on his part in the presence of all this congregation. For
though the object of this work has regard to another person; viz., that
we may produce the utterances of Abbot John <span
id="fr_2105"></span>[2106](#fn_2105.md) who left the desert and submitted
himself to that Cœnobium with the utmost goodness and humility, yet we
think it not at all absurd to relate without any unnecessary verbiage,
what we think is most instructive to those who are eager for goodness.
And so when the whole body of the monks was seated in separate parties
of twelve, in the large open court, when one of the brethren had been
rather slow in fetching and bringing in a dish, the aforesaid Abbot
Paul, who was busily hurrying about among the troops of brethren who
were serving, saw it and struck him such a blow before them all on his
open palm that the sound of the hand which was struck actually reached
the ears of those whose backs were turned and who were sitting some way
off. But the youth of remarkable patience received it with such calmness
of mind that not only did he let no word fall from his mouth or give the
slightest sign of murmuring by the silent movements of his lips, but
actually did not change colour in the slightest degree or (lose) the
modest and peaceful look about his mouth. <span id="page_490">p.

with astonishment not merely us, who had lately come from a monastery of
Syria and had not learnt the blessing of this patience by such clear
examples, but all those as well who were not without experience of such
earnestness, so that by it a great lesson was taught even to those who
were well advanced, because even if this paternal correction had not
disturbed his patience, neither did the presence of so great a number
bring the slightest sign of colour to his cheeks.
