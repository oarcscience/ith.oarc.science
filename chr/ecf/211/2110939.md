<span id="iv.v.viii.xix"></span>

#### <span id="iv.v.viii.xix-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIX.

<span id="iv.v.viii.xix-p1"></span>The answer, that leave to lie, which
was not even granted under the old Covenant, has rightly been taken by
many.

<span id="iv.v.viii.xix-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.viii.xix-p2.1"></span>Joseph</span>: All liberty in the matter
of wives and many concubines, as the end of time is approaching and the
multiplying of the human race completed, ought rightly to be cut off by
evangelical perfection, as being no longer necessary. For up to the
coming of Christ it was well that the blessing of the original sentence
should be in full vigour, whereby it was said: “Increase and multiply,
and fill the earth.” <span id="fr_2024"></span>[2025](#fn_2024.md) And
therefore it was quite right that from the root of human fecundity which
happily flourished in the synagogue, in accordance with that
dispensation of the times, the buds of angelical virginity should
spring, and the fragrant flowers of continence be produced in the
Church. But that lying was even then condemned the text of the whole Old
Testament clearly shows, as it says: “Thou shalt destroy all them that
speak lies;” and again: “The bread of lying is sweet to a man, but
afterwards his mouth is filled with gravel;” and the Giver of the law
himself says: “Thou shalt avoid a lie.” <span
id="fr_2025"></span>[2026](#fn_2025.md) But we said that it was then
properly employed as a last resort when some need or plan of salvation
was linked on to it, on account of which it ought not to be condemned.
As is the case, which you mentioned, of king David when in his flight
from the unjust persecution of Saul, to Abimelech the priest he used
lying words, not with the object of getting any gain nor with the desire
to injure anybody, but simply to save himself from that most iniquitous
persecution; inasmuch as he would not stain his hands with the blood of
the hostile king, so often delivered up to him by God; as he said: “The
Lord be merciful to me that I may do no such thing to my master the
Lord’s anointed, as to lay my hand upon him, because he is the Lord’s
anointed.” <span id="fr_2026"></span>[2027](#fn_2026.md) And therefore
these plans which we hear that holy men under the old covenant adopted
either from the will of God, or for the prefiguring of spiritual
mysteries or for the salvation of some people, we too cannot refuse
altogether, when necessity constrains us, as we see that even apostles
did not avoid them, where the consideration of something profitable
required them: which in the meanwhile we will for a time postpone, while
we first discuss those instances which we propose still to bring forward
from the Old Testament, and afterwards we shall more suitably introduce
them so as more readily to prove that good and holy men, both in the Old
and in the New Testament, were entirely at one with each other in these
contrivances. For what shall we say of that pious fraud of Hushai to
Absalom for the salvation of king David, which though uttered with all
appearance of good-will by the deceiver and cheat, and opposed to the
good of him who asked advice, is yet commended by the authority of Holy
Scripture, which says: “But by the will of the Lord the profitable
counsel of Ahithophel was defeated that the Lord might bring evil upon
Absalom?” <span id="fr_2027"></span>[2028](#fn_2027.md) Nor could that be
blamed which was done for the right side with a right purpose and pious
intent, and was planned for the salvation and victory of one whose piety
was pleasing to God, by a holy dissimulation. What too shall we say of
the deed of that woman, who received the men who had been sent to king
David by the aforesaid Hushai, and hid them in a well, and spread a
cloth over its mouth, and pretended that she was drying pearl-barley,
and said “They passed on after tasting a little water”; <span
id="fr_2028"></span>[2029](#fn_2028.md) and by this invention saved them
from the hands of their pursuers? Wherefore answer me, I pray you, and
say what you would have done, if any similar situation had arisen for
you, living now under the gospel; would you prefer to hide them with a
similar falsehood, saying in the same way: “They passed on after tasting
a little water,” and thus fulfil the command: “Deliver those who are
being led to death, and spare not to redeem those who are being
killed;” <span id="fr_2029"></span>[2030](#fn_2029.md) or by speaking the
truth, would you have given up those in hiding to the men who would kill
them? And what then becomes of the Apostle’s words: “Let no man seek his
own but the things of another:” and: “Love seeketh not her own, but the
things of others;” and of himself he says: “I seek not mine own good but
the good of many that they may be saved?” <span
id="fr_2030"></span>[2031](#fn_2030.md) For if we seek our own, <span
id="page_467">p. 467</span> <span id="iv.v.viii.xix-Page_467"></span>and
want obstinately to keep what is good for ourselves, we must even in
urgent cases of this sort speak the truth, and so become guilty of the
death of another: but if we prefer what is for another’s advantage to
our own good, and satisfy the demands of the Apostle, we shall certainly
have to put up with the necessity of lying. And therefore we shall not
be able to keep a perfect heart of love, or to seek, as Apostolic
perfection requires, the things of others, unless we relax a little in
those things which concern the strictness and perfection of our own
lives, and choose to condescend with ready affection to what is useful
to others, and so with the Apostle become weak to the weak, that we may
be able to gain the weak.
