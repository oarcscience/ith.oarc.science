#### <span id="iv.iii.vii.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.

<span id="iv.iii.vii.iii-p1"></span>What is the usefulness of those
vices which are natural to us.

<span id="iv.iii.vii.iii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.vii.iii-p2.1"></span>For</span> example, do not we see those
natural impulses of the flesh not only in boys in whom innocence still
anticipates the discernment of good and evil, but even in little
children and infants, who although they have not even the slightest
approach to lust within them, yet show that the impulses of the flesh
exist in them and are naturally excited? Do not we also see that the
deadly pricks of anger already exist in full vigour likewise in little
children? and before they have learnt the virtue of patience, we see
that they are disturbed by wrongs, and feel affronts offered to them
even by way of a joke; and sometimes, although strength is lacking to
them, the desire to avenge themselves is not wanting, when anger excites
them. Nor do I say this to lay the blame on their natural state, but to
point out that of these impulses which proceed from us, some are
implanted in us for a useful purpose, while some are introduced from
without, through the fault of carelessness and the desire of an evil
will. For these carnal impulses, of which we spoke above, were with a
useful purpose implanted in our bodies by the providence of the Creator,
viz.: for perpetuating the race, and raising up children for posterity:
and not for committing adulteries and debaucheries, which the authority
of the law also condemns. The pricks of anger too, do we not see that
they have been most wisely given to us, that being enraged at our sins
and mistakes, we may apply ourselves the rather to virtues and spiritual
exercises, showing forth all love towards God, and patience towards our
brethren? We know too how great is the use of sorrow, which is reckoned
among the other vices, when it is turned to an opposite use. For on the
one hand, when it is in accordance with the fear of God it is most
needful, and on the other, when it is in accordance with the world, most
pernicious; as the Apostle teaches us when he says that “the sorrow
which is according to God worketh repentance that is steadfast unto
salvation, but the sorrow of the world worketh death.” <span
