#### <span id="iv.vii.viii.xxv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXV.

<span id="iv.vii.viii.xxv-p1"></span>He shows that Ambrose agrees with
S. Hilary.

<span id="iv.vii.viii.xxv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.viii.xxv-p2.1"></span>Ambrose</span>, that illustrious priest
of God, who never leaving the Lord’s hand, ever shone like a jewel upon
the finger of God, thus speaks in his book to the Virgins: “My brother
is white and ruddy. <span id="fr_2663"></span>[2664](#fn_2663.md) White
because He is the glory of the Father: ruddy because He was born of the
Virgin. But remember that in Him the tokens of Divinity are of longer
standing than the mysteries of the body. For He did not <span
id="page_618">p. 618</span> <span
id="iv.vii.viii.xxv-Page_618"></span>begin to exist from the Virgin, but
He who was already in existence, came into the Virgin.” <span
id="fr_2664"></span>[2665](#fn_2664.md) Again on Christmas Day: “See the
miracle of the mother of the Lord: A Virgin conceived, a Virgin brought
forth. She was a Virgin when she conceived, a Virgin when with child, a
Virgin after the birth. As is said in Ezekiel: “And the gate was shut
and not opened, because the Lord passed through it.” <span
id="fr_2665"></span>[2666](#fn_2665.md) A splendid Virginity, and wondrous
fruitfulness! The Lord of the world is born: and there are no cries from
her who brought Him forth. The womb is left empty, and a true child is
born, and yet the Virginity is not destroyed. It was right that when God
was born the power of chastity should become greater, and that her
purity should not be violated by the going forth of Him who had come to
heal what was corrupt.” <span id="fr_2666"></span>[2667](#fn_2666.md) Again
in his exposition of the gospel according to Luke he says that “one was
especially chosen, to bring forth God, who was espoused to an
husband.” <span id="fr_2667"></span>[2668](#fn_2667.md) He certainly
declares that God was born of the Virgin. He calls Mary the mother of
God. And where is that awful and execrable utterance of yours asking how
can she be the mother of one of a different nature from her own. But if
she is called mother by them, it is the human nature which was born not
the Godhead. So, that illustrious teacher of the faith says both that
she who bare Him was human, and that He who was born is God: and yet
that this is no reason for unbelief, but only a miracle of faith.
