#### <span id="iv.iii.xi.xix-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIX.

<span id="iv.iii.xi.xix-p1"></span>Remedies by which we can overcome
vainglory.

<span id="iv.iii.xi.xix-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.xi.xix-p2.1"></span>And</span> so the athlete of Christ who
desires to strive lawfully in this true and spiritual combat, should
strive by all means to overcome this changeable monster of many shapes,
which, as it attacks us on every side like some manifold wickedness, we
can escape by such a remedy as this; viz., thinking on that saying of
David: “The Lord hath scattered the bones of those who please
men.” <span id="fr_1016"></span>[1017](#fn_1016.md) To begin with we should
not allow ourselves to do anything at the suggestion of vanity, and for
the sake of obtaining vainglory. Next, when we have begun a thing well,
we should endeavour to maintain it with just the same care, for fear
lest afterwards the malady of vainglory should creep in and make void
all the fruits of our labours. And anything which is of very little use
or value in the common life of the brethren, we should avoid as leading
to boasting; and whatever would render us remarkable amongst the others,
and for which credit would be gained among men, as if we were the only
people who could do it, this should be shunned by us. For by these signs
the deadly taint of vainglory will be shown to cling to us: which we
shall most easily escape if we consider that we shall not merely lose
the fruits of those labours of ours which we have performed at the
suggestion of vainglory, but that we shall also be guilty of a great
sin, and as impious persons undergo eternal punishments, inasmuch as we
have wronged God by doing for the favour of men what we ought to have
done for His sake, and are convicted by Him who knows all secrets of
having preferred men to God, and the praise of the world to the praise
of the Lord.
