#### <span id="iv.iii.xii.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VIII.

<span id="iv.iii.xii.viii-p1"></span>How God has destroyed the pride of
the devil by the virtue of humility, and various passages in proof of
this.

<span id="iv.iii.xii.viii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.xii.viii-p2.1"></span>And</span> so God, the Creator and
Healer of all, knowing that pride is the cause and fountain head of
evils, has been careful to heal opposites with opposites, that those
things which were ruined by pride might be restored by humility. For the
one says, “I will ascend into heaven;” <span
id="fr_1027"></span>[1028](#fn_1027.md) the other, “My soul was brought low
even to the ground.” <span id="fr_1028"></span>[1029](#fn_1028.md) The one
says, “And I will be like the most High;” the other, “Though He was in
the form of God, yet He emptied Himself and took the form of a servant,
and humbled Himself and became obedient unto death.” <span
id="fr_1029"></span>[1030](#fn_1029.md) The one says, “I will exalt my
throne above the stars of God;” the other, “Learn of me, for I am meek
and lowly of heart.” <span id="fr_1030"></span>[1031](#fn_1030.md) The one
says, “I know not the Lord and will not let Israel go;” <span
id="fr_1031"></span>[1032](#fn_1031.md) the other, “If I say that I know
Him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know Him, and keep His
commandments.” <span id="fr_1032"></span>[1033](#fn_1032.md) The one says,
“My rivers are mine and I made them:” <span
id="fr_1033"></span>[1034](#fn_1033.md) the other: “I can do nothing of
myself, but my Father who abideth in me, He doeth the works.” <span
id="fr_1034"></span>[1035](#fn_1034.md) The one says, “All the kingdoms of
the world and the glory of them are mine, and to whomsoever I will, I
give them;” <span id="fr_1035"></span>[1036](#fn_1035.md) the other,
“Though He were rich yet He became poor, that we through His poverty
might be made rich.” <span id="fr_1036"></span>[1037](#fn_1036.md) The one
says, “As eggs are gathered together which are left, so have I gathered
all the earth: and there was none that moved the wing or opened the
mouth, or made the least noise;” <span
id="fr_1037"></span>[1038](#fn_1037.md) the other, “I am become like a
solitary pelican; I watched and became as a sparrow alone upon the
roof.” <span id="fr_1038"></span>[1039](#fn_1038.md) The one says, “I have
dried up with the sole of my foot all the rivers shut up in
banks;” <span id="fr_1039"></span>[1040](#fn_1039.md) the other, “Cannot I
ask my Father, and He shall presently give me more than twelve legions
of angels?” <span id="fr_1040"></span>[1041](#fn_1040.md) If we look at the
reason of our original fall, and the foundations of our salvation, and
consider by whom and in what way the latter were laid and the former
originated, we may learn, either through the fall of the devil, or
through the example of Christ, how to avoid so terrible a death from
pride.
