#### <span id="iv.vi.v.xxvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXVI.

<span id="iv.vi.v.xxvi-p1"></span>How we ought also to offer our
firstfruits to the Lord.

<span id="iv.vi.v.xxvi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.v.xxvi-p2.1"></span>But</span> what shall I say of the
firstfruits which surely are given daily by all who serve Christ <span
id="page_514">p. 514</span> <span
id="iv.vi.v.xxvi-Page_514"></span>faithfully? For when men waking from
sleep and arising with renewed activity after their rest, before they
take in any impulse or thought in their heart, or admit any recollection
or consideration of business consecrate their first and earliest
thoughts as divine offerings, what are they doing indeed but rendering
the firstfruits of their produce through the High Priest Jesus Christ
for the enjoyment of this life and a figure of the daily resurrection?
And also when roused from sleep in the same way they offer to God a
sacrifice of joy and invoke Him with the first motion of their tongue
and celebrate His name and praise, and throwing open, the first thing,
the door of their lips to sing hymns to Him they offer to God the
offices of their mouth; and to Him also in the same way their bring the
earliest offerings of their hands and steps, when they rise from bed and
stand in prayer and before they use the services of their limbs for
their own purposes, take to themselves nothing of their services, but
for His glory advance their steps, and set them in His praise and so
render the first fruits of all their movements by stretching forth the
hands, bending the knees, and prostrating the whole body. For in no
other way can we fulfil that of which we sing in the Psalm: “I prevented
the dawning of the day and cried;” and: “Mine eyes to Thee have
prevented the morning that I might meditate on Thy words;” and: “In the
morning shall my prayer prevent Thee;” <span
id="fr_2207"></span>[2208](#fn_2207.md) unless after our rest in sleep
when, as we said above, we are restored as from darkness and death to
this light, we have the courage not to begin by taking any of all the
services both of mind and body for our own uses. For there is no other
morning which the prophet “prevented,” or which in the same way we ought
to prevent, except either ourselves, i.e., our occupations and feelings
and earthly cares, without which we cannot exist—or the most subtle
suggestions of the adversary, which he tries to suggest to us, while
still resting and overcome with sleep, by the phantoms of vain dreams,
with which, when we presently awake, he will fill our minds and occupy
us, that he may be the first to seize and carry off the spoils of our
firstfruits. Wherefore we must take the utmost care (if we want to
fulfil in act the meaning of the above quoted verse) that an anxious
watchfulness takes regard of our first and earliest morning thoughts,
that they may not be defiled beforehand being hastily taken possession
of by our jealous adversary, and thus he may make our firstfruits to be
rejected by the Lord as worthless and common. And if he is not prevented
by us with watchful circumspection of mind, he will not lay aside his
habit of miserably anticipating us nor cease day after day to prevent us
by his wiles. And therefore if we want to offer firstfruits that are
acceptable and well pleasing to God of the fruits of our mind, we ought
to spend no ordinary care to keep all the senses of our body, especially
during the hours of the morning, as a sacred holocaust to the Lord pure
and undefiled in all things. And this kind of devotion many even of
those who live in the world observe with the utmost care, as they rise
before it is light or very early, and do not at all mix in the ordinary
and necessary business of this world before hastening to church and
striving to consecrate in the sight of God the firstfruits of all their
actions and doings.
