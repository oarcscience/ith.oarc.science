<span id="ii.vi.ii.xxxii-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.vi.ii.xxxii-p1.1"></span>After</span> Adrian, the churches had
peace under the rule of Antoninus Pius. Then the fifth persecution began
under Aurelius, the son of Antoninus. And then, for the first time,
martyrdoms were seen taking place in Gaul, for the religion of God had
been accepted somewhat late beyond the Alps. Then the sixth persecution
of the Christians took place under the emperor Severus. At this time
Leonida, the father of Origen, poured forth his sacred blood in
martyrdom. Then, during an interval of thirty-eight years, the
Christians enjoyed peace, except that at the middle of that time
Maximinus persecuted the clerics of some churches. Ere long, under
Decius as emperor, the seventh bloody persecution broke out against the
Christians. Next, Valerian proved himself the eighth enemy of the
saints. After him, with an interval of about fifty years, there arose,
under the emperors Diocletian and Maximian, a most bitter persecution
which, for ten continuous years, wasted the people of God. At this
period, almost the whole world was stained with the sacred blood of the
martyrs. In fact, they vied with each other in rushing upon these
glorious struggles, and martyrdom by glorious deaths was then much more
keenly sought after than bishoprics are now attempted to be got by
wicked ambition. Never more than at that time was the world exhausted by
wars, nor did we ever achieve victory with a greater triumph than when
we showed that we could not be conquered by the slaughters of ten long
years. There survive also accounts of the sufferings of the martyrs at
that time which were committed to writing; but I do not think it
suitable to subjoin these lest I should exceed the limits prescribed to
this work.
