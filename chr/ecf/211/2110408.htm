<p><a name="iv.iii.v.xxxv-p3"></A>And since the virtues of the fathers and the grace given to them have tempted us to turn aside to a story like this, I think it well to record in this volume a noteworthy deed of charity, which we experienced from the kindness of that most excellent man Archebius, that the purity of continence grafted on to a work of charity may more readily shine forth, being embellished with a pleasing variety. <A NAME="page_246"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 246</FONT></A> <a name="iv.iii.v.xxxv-Page_246"></A>For the duty of fasting is then rendered acceptable to God, when it is made perfect by the fruits of charity.</p>
