#### <span id="iv.iii.vii.xiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIII.

<span id="iv.iii.vii.xiii-p1"></span>What the elders relate to the
juniors in the matter of stripping off sins.

<span id="iv.iii.vii.xiii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.vii.xiii-p2.1"></span>But</span> let not this seem
superfluous or objectionable to any one. For unless the different kinds
of sins are first explained, and the origin and causes of diseases
traced out, the proper healing remedies cannot be applied to the sick,
nor can the preservation of perfect health be secured by the strong. For
both these matters and many others besides these are generally put
forward for the instruction of the younger brethren by the elders in
their conferences, as they have had experience of numberless falls and
the ruin of all sorts of people. And often recognizing in ourselves many
of these things, when the elders explained and showed them, as men who
were themselves disquieted <span id="fr_883"></span>[884](#fn_883.md) by
the same passions, we were cured without any shame or confusion on our
part, since without saying anything we learnt both the remedies and the
causes of the sins which beset us, which we have passed over and said
nothing about, not from fear of the brethren, but lest our book should
chance to fall into the hands of some who have had no instruction in
this way of life, and might disclose to inexperienced persons what ought
to be known only to those who are toiling and striving to reach the
heights of perfection.
