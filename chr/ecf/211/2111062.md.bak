#### <span id="iv.vi.viii.ii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.

<span id="iv.vi.viii.ii-p1"></span>How the old man exposed our errors.

<span id="iv.vi.viii.ii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.viii.ii-p2.1"></span>The</span> feebleness of your ideas shows
that you have not yet renounced worldly desires nor mortified your
former lusts. For as the wandering character of your desires testifies
to the sloth of your heart, this pilgrimage and absence from your
kinsfolk, which you ought rather to endure with your heart, you *do*
endure only with the flesh. For all these things would have been buried
and altogether driven out of your hearts, if you had got hold of the
right method of renunciation, and the main reason for the solitude in
which we dwell. And so I see that you are labouring under that infirmity
of sluggishness, which is thus described in Proverbs: “Every sluggard is
always desiring something;” and again: “Desires kill the
slothful.” <span id="fr_2295"></span>[2296](#fn_2295.md) For in our case
too these supplies of worldly conveniences, which you have described,
would not be wanting, if we believed that they were appropriate to our
calling, or thought that we could get out of those delights and
pleasures as much profit as that which is gained from this squalor of
the country and bodily affliction. Nor are we so deprived of the solace
of our kinsfolk, that those who delight to support us with their
substance should fail us, were it not that this saying of the Saviour
meets us and excludes everything that contributes to the support of this
flesh, as He says: “He who doth not leave (or hate) father and mother
and children and brethren cannot be My disciple.” <span
id="fr_2296"></span>[2297](#fn_2296.md) But if we were altogether deprived
of the protection of our parents, the services of the princes of this
world would not be wanting, as they would most thankfully rejoice to
minister to our necessities with prompt liberality. And supported by
their bounty, we should be free from the care of preparing food, were it
not that this curse of the prophet terribly frightened us. For “Cursed,”
he says, “is the man that putteth his hope in man;” and: “Put not your
trust in princes.” <span id="fr_2297"></span>[2298](#fn_2297.md) We should
also at any rate place our cells on the banks of the river Nile and have
water at our very doors, so as not to be obliged to carry it on our
necks for four miles, were it not that the blessed Apostle rendered us
indefatigable in enduring this labour, and cheered us by his words,
saying: “Every one shall receive his own reward according to his
labour.” <span id="fr_2298"></span>[2299](#fn_2298.md) Nor are we ignorant
that there are even in our country some pleasant recesses, where plenty
of fruits, and pleasant gardens, and fertile ground would furnish the
food we need with the slightest bodily efforts on our part, were it not
that we were afraid lest that reproach might apply to us, which is
directed against the rich man in the gospel: “Because thou hast received
thy consolation in this life.” <span
id="fr_2299"></span>[2300](#fn_2299.md) But as we despise all these things
and scorn them together with all the pleasures of this world, we delight
only in this squalor, and prefer to all luxuries this dreadful and vast
desert, and cannot compare any riches of a fertile soil to these <span
id="page_533">p. 533</span> <span
id="iv.vi.viii.ii-Page_533"></span>barren sands, as we pursue no
temporal gains of this body, but the eternal rewards of the spirit. For
it is but little for a monk to have once made his renunciation, i.e., in
the early days of his conversion to have disregarded the present world,
unless he continues to renounce it daily. For to the very end of this
life we must with the prophet say this: “And I have not desired the day
of man, Thou knowest.” <span id="fr_2300"></span>[2301](#fn_2300.md)
Wherefore also the Lord says in the gospel: “If any man will come after
Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow
Me.” <span id="fr_2301"></span>[2302](#fn_2301.md)
