#### <span id="ii.iv.iii.xvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVII.

<span id="ii.iv.iii.xvii-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.iii.xvii-p1.1"></span>Then</span> said I, since I perceived by
the setting sun that evening was at hand: “The day is gone, Postumianus;
we must rise up; and at the same time some refreshment is due to these
<span id="page_54">p. 54</span> <span
id="ii.iv.iii.xvii-Page_54"></span>so zealous listeners. And as to
Martin, you ought not to expect that there is any limit to one talking
about him: he extends too far to be comprised fully in any conversation.
In the meantime, you will convey to the East the things you have now
heard about that famous man; and as you retrace your steps to your
former haunts, and pass along by various coasts, places, harbors,
islands, and seas, see that you spread among the peoples the name and
glory of Martin. Especially remember that you do not omit Campania; and
although your route will take you far off the beaten track, still any
expenditure from delay will not be to you of so much importance as to
keep you from visiting in that quarter Paulinus, a man renowned and
praised throughout the whole world. I beg you first to unroll to him the
volume of discourse which we either completed yesterday, or have said
to-day. You will relate all to him; you will repeat all to him; that in
due time, by his means, Rome may learn the sacred merits of this man,
just as he spread that first little book of ours not only through Italy,
but even through the whole of Illyria. He, not jealous of the glories of
Martin, and being a most pious admirer of his saintly excellences in
Christ, will not refuse to compare our leading man with his own friend
Felix. Next, if you happen to cross over to Africa, you will relate what
you have heard to Carthage; and, although, as you yourself have said, it
already knows the man, yet now pre-eminently it will learn more
respecting him, that it may not admire its own martyr Cyprian alone,
although consecrated by his sacred blood. And then, if carried down a
little to the left, you enter the gulf of Achaia, let Corinth know, and
let Athens know, that Plato in the academy was not wiser, and that
Socrates in the prison was not braver, than Martin. You will say to them
that Greece was indeed happy which was thought worthy to listen to an
apostle pleading, but that Christ has by no means forsaken Gaul, since
he has granted it to possess such a man as Martin. But when you have
come as far as Egypt, although it is justly proud of the numbers and
virtues of its own saints, yet let it not disdain to hear how Europe
will not yield to it, or to all Asia, in having only Martin.
