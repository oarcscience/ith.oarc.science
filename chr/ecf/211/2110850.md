<span id="iv.v.iv.ix"></span>

#### <span id="iv.v.iv.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.

<span id="iv.v.iv.ix-p1"></span>Of the power of our good will, and the
grace of God.

<span id="iv.v.iv.ix-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.iv.ix-p2.1"></span>Whence</span> human reason cannot easily
decide how the Lord gives to those that ask, is found by those that
seek, and opens to those that knock, and on the other hand is found by
those that sought Him not, appears openly among those who asked not for
Him, and all the day long stretches forth His hands to an unbelieving
and gainsaying people, calls those who resist and stand afar off, draws
men against their will to salvation, takes away from those who want to
sin the faculty of carrying out their desire, in His goodness stands in
the way of those who are rushing into wickedness. But who can easily see
how it is that the completion of our salvation is assigned to our own
will, of which it is said: “If ye be willing, and hearken unto Me, ye
shall eat the good things of the land,” <span
id="fr_1765"></span>[1766](#fn_1765.md) and how it is “not of him that
willeth or runneth, but of God that hath mercy?” <span
id="fr_1766"></span>[1767](#fn_1766.md) What too is this, that God “will
render to every man according to his works;” <span
id="fr_1767"></span>[1768](#fn_1767.md) and “it is God who worketh in you
both to will and to do, of His good pleasure;” <span
id="fr_1768"></span>[1769](#fn_1768.md) and “this is not of yourselves but
it is the gift of God: not of works, that no man may boast?” <span
id="fr_1769"></span>[1770](#fn_1769.md) What is this too which is said:
“Draw near to the Lord, and He will draw near to you,” <span
id="fr_1770"></span>[1771](#fn_1770.md) and what He says elsewhere: “No man
cometh unto Me except the Father who sent Me draw Him?” <span
id="fr_1771"></span>[1772](#fn_1771.md) What is it that we find: “Make
straight paths for your feet and direct your ways,” <span
id="fr_1772"></span>[1773](#fn_1772.md) and what is it that we say in our
prayers: “Direct my way in Thy sight,” and “establish my goings in Thy
paths, that my footsteps be not moved?” <span
id="fr_1773"></span>[1774](#fn_1773.md) What is it again that we are
admonished: “Make you a new heart and a new spirit,” <span
id="fr_1774"></span>[1775](#fn_1774.md) and what is this which is promised
to us: “I will <span id="page_427">p. 427</span> <span
id="iv.v.iv.ix-Page_427"></span>give them one heart and will put a new
spirit within them:” and “I will take away the stony heart from their
flesh and will give them an heart of flesh that they may walk in Thy
statutes and keep My judgments?” <span
id="fr_1775"></span>[1776](#fn_1775.md) What is it that the Lord commands,
where He says: “Wash thine heart of iniquity, O Jerusalem, that thou
mayest be saved,” <span id="fr_1776"></span>[1777](#fn_1776.md) and what is
it that the prophet asks for from the Lord, when he says “Create in me a
clean heart, O God,” and again: “Thou shalt wash me, and I shall be
whiter than snow?” <span id="fr_1777"></span>[1778](#fn_1777.md) What is it
that is said to us: “Enlighten yourselves with the light of
knowledge;” <span id="fr_1778"></span>[1779](#fn_1778.md) and this which is
said of God: “Who teacheth man knowledge;” <span
id="fr_1779"></span>[1780](#fn_1779.md) and: “the Lord enlightens the
blind,” <span id="fr_1780"></span>[1781](#fn_1780.md) or at any rate this,
which we say in our prayers with the prophet: “Lighten mine eyes that I
sleep not in death,” <span id="fr_1781"></span>[1782](#fn_1781.md) unless
in all these there is a declaration of the grace of God and the freedom
of our will, because even of his own motion a man can be led to the
quest of virtue, but always stands in need of the help of the Lord? For
neither does anyone enjoy good health whenever he will, nor is he at his
own will and pleasure set free from disease and sickness. But what good
is it to have desired the blessing of health, unless God, who grants us
the enjoyments of life itself, grant also vigorous and sound health? But
that it may be still clearer that through the excellence of nature which
is granted by the goodness of the Creator, sometimes first beginnings of
a good will arise, which however cannot attain to the complete
performance of what is good unless it is guided by the Lord, the Apostle
bears witness and says: “For to will is present with me, but to perform
what is good I find not.” <span id="fr_1782"></span>[1783](#fn_1782.md)
