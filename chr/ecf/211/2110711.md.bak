#### <span id="iv.iv.viii.ii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.

<span id="iv.iv.viii.ii-p1"></span>The question of the aforesaid old man
on the state of our thoughts.

<span id="iv.iv.viii.ii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.viii.ii-p2.1"></span>This</span> man then in his prayers by
day and night, and in fasts and vigils unweariedly entreated for inward
chastity of heart and soul, and seeing that he had obtained what he
wished and prayed for, and that all the passions of carnal concupiscence
in his heart were dead, was roused as it were by the sweetest taste of
purity, and inflamed by his zeal for <span id="page_362">p. 362</span>
<span id="iv.iv.viii.ii-Page_362"></span>chastity towards a yet more
ardent desire, and began to apply himself to stricter fasts and prayers
that the mortification of this passion which by God’s grace had been
granted to his inner man, might be extended also so as to include
external purity, to such an extent that he might no longer be affected
by any simple and natural movement, such as is excited even in children
and infants. And by the experience of the gift he had obtained, which he
knew he had secured by no merit of his labours, but by the grace God, he
was the more ardently stimulated to obtain this also in like manner, as
he believed that God could much more easily tear up by the roots this
incitement of the flesh, (which even by man’s art and skill is sometimes
destroyed by potions and remedies or by the use of the knife) since He
had of His own free gift conferred that purity of spirit which is a
still greater thing, and which cannot be acquired by human efforts and
exertions. And when with unceasing supplications and tears he was
applying himself unweariedly to the petition he had commenced, there
came to him an angel in a vision by night, and seemed to open his belly,
and to remove from his bowels a sort of fiery fleshly humour, and to
cast it away, and restore everything to its place as before; and “lo” he
said, “the incitements of your flesh are removed, and you may be sure
that you have this day obtained that lasting purity of body for which
you have faithfully asked.” It will be enough thus briefly to have told
this of the grace of God which was granted to this famous man in a
special way. But I deem it unnecessary to say anything of those virtues
which he possessed in common with other good men, for fear lest that
particular narrative on this man’s name might seem to deprive others of
that which is specially mentioned of him. Him therefore, as we were
inflamed with the greatest eagerness for conference with and instruction
from him, we arranged to visit in Lent; and when he had very quietly
inquired of us of the character of our thoughts and the state of our
inner man, and what help we had got towards its purity from our long
stay in the desert, we approached him with these complaints:
