#### <span id="ii.vi.i.xlvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XLVI.

<span id="ii.vi.i.xlvi-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.vi.i.xlvi-p1.1"></span>But</span> Jeu possessed the kingdom of
Joram. After the death of Ochozia in Judæa, when he had reigned one
year, his mother, Gotholiah, seized the supreme power, having deprived
her grandson (whose name was Joas) of the government, he being at the
time but a little child. But the power thus snatched from him by his
grandmother was, after eight years, restored to him through means of the
priests and people, while his grandmother was driven into exile. He, at
the beginning of his reign, was most devoted to the divine worship, and
embellished the temple at great expense; afterwards, however, being
corrupted by the flattery of the chief men, and unduly honored by them,
he incurred wrath. For Azahel, king of Syria, made war upon him; and, as
things went badly with him, he purchased peace with the gold of the
temple. He did not, however, obtain it; but through resentment for what
he had done he was slain by his own people in the fortieth year of his
reign. He was succeeded by his son Amassia. But, on the side of the ten
tribes, Jeu having died, Joachas his son began to reign, displeasing to
God on account of his wicked works, in punishment of which his kingdom
was ravaged by the Syrians, until, through the mercy of God, the enemy
was driven back, and the inhabitants of the land began to occupy their
former position. Joachas, having ended his days, left the kingdom to his
son Joa. He raised civil war against Amassia, king of the two tribes;
and, having obtained the victory, conveyed much spoil into his own
kingdom. That is related to have occurred to Amassia as a punishment of
his sin, for, having entered as a conqueror the territories of the
Idumæans, he had adopted the idols of that nation. He is described as
having reigned nine years, so far as I find it stated in the Books of
Kings. But in the Chronicles <span id="fr_319"></span>[320](#fn_319.md) of
Scripture, as well as in the Chronicles <span
id="fr_320"></span>[321](#fn_320.md) of Eusebius, he is affirmed to have
held the government twenty-nine years; and the mode of reckoning which
may easily be perceived in these Books of Kings undoubtedly leads to
that conclusion. For Jeroboam is said to have begun to reign as king of
the ten tribes in the eighth year of the reign of Amassia, and to have
held the government forty-one years, and to have at length died in the
fourth year of the reign of Ozia, son of Amassia. By this mode of
reckoning, the reign of Amassia is made to extend over twenty-eight
years. Accordingly, we, following out this, inasmuch as it is our
purpose to adhere in this work to the dates in their proper order, have
accepted the authority of the Chronicles. <span
