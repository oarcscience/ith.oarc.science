#### <span id="iv.vii.v.xii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XII.

<span id="iv.vii.v.xii-p1"></span>How the title of Saviour is given to
Christ in one sense, and to men in another.

<span id="iv.vii.v.xii-p2"></span>“<span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.v.xii-p2.1"></span>Thou</span>,” he says, “art our God, and
we knew Thee not, O God of Israel the Saviour.” Although holy Scripture
has already shown by many and clear tokens, who is here spoken of, yet
it has most plainly pointed to the name of Christ by using the name of
Saviour: for surely the Saviour is the same as Christ, as the angel
says: “For to you is born this day a Saviour who is Christ the
Lord.” <span id="fr_2481"></span>[2482](#fn_2481.md) For everybody knows
that in Hebrew “Jesus” means “Saviour,” as the angel announced to the
holy Virgin Mary, saying: “And thou shalt call His name Jesus, for He it
is that shall save His people from their sins.” <span
id="fr_2482"></span>[2483](#fn_2482.md) And that you may not say that He is
termed Saviour in the same sense as the title is given to others (“And
the Lord raised up to them a Saviour, Othniel the Son of Kenaz,” <span
id="fr_2483"></span>[2484](#fn_2483.md) and again, “the Lord raised up to
them a Saviour, Ehud the son of Gera” <span
id="fr_2484"></span>[2485](#fn_2484) .md), he added: “for He it is that
shall save His people from their sins.” But it does not lie in the power
of a man to redeem his people from the captivity of sin,—a thing which
is only possible for Him of whom it is said, “Behold the Lamb of God,
which taketh away the sin of the world.” <span
id="fr_2485"></span>[2486](#fn_2485.md) For the others saved a people not
their own but God’s, and not from their sins, but from their enemies.
