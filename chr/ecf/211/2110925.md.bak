#### <span id="iv.v.viii.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.

<span id="iv.v.viii.v-p1"></span>The explanation of Abbot Germanus why
we wanted to stay in Egypt, and were drawn back to Syria.

<span id="iv.v.viii.v-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.viii.v-p2.1"></span>To</span> this Germanus: We used to think,
said he, that we should go back to our monastery abundantly filled not
only with spiritual joy but also with what is profitable by the sight of
your holiness, and that after our return we should follow, though with
but a feeble rivalry, what we had learnt from your teaching. For this
our love for our Elders led us to promise them, while we fancied that we
could in some degree follow in that monastery your sublime life and
doctrine. Wherefore as we thought that by this means all joy would be
bestowed upon us, so on the other hand we are overwhelmed with
intolerable grief, as we find that we cannot possibly obtain in this way
what we know to be good for us. On both sides then we are now hemmed in.
For if we want to keep our promise which we made in the presence of all
the brethren in the cave where our Lord Himself shone forth from His
chamber in the Virgin’s womb, <span id="fr_2014"></span>[2015](#fn_2014.md)
and which He Himself witnessed, we shall incur the greatest loss in our
spiritual life. But if we ignore our promise and stay in this district,
and choose to consider that oath of ours as of less importance than our
perfection, we are afraid of the awful dangers of falsehood and perjury.
But not even by this plan can we lighten our burdens; viz., by
fulfilling the terms of our oath by a very hasty return, and then coming
back again as quickly as possible to these parts. For although even a
small delay is dangerous and hurtful for those who are aiming at
goodness and advance in spiritual things, yet still we would keep our
faith and promise, though by an unwilling return, were it not that we
felt sure that we should be so tightly bound down both by the authority
and also by the love of the Elders, that we should henceforth have no
opportunity at all to come back again to this place.
