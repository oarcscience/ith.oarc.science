#### <span id="iv.iv.vii.xiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIV.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xiv-p1"></span>The answer to the point raised by the
questioner.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xiv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.vii.xiv-p2.1"></span>Theodore</span>: It is needful that one
must either, as the Apostle says, “be renewed in the spirit of the
mind,” <span id="fr_1426"></span>[1427](#fn_1426.md) and daily advance by
“pressing forward to those things which are before,” <span
id="fr_1427"></span>[1428](#fn_1427.md) or, if one neglects to do this, the
sure result will be to go back, and become <span id="page_360">p.
360</span> <span id="iv.iv.vii.xiv-Page_360"></span>worse and worse. And
therefore the mind cannot possibly remain in one and the same state.
Just as when a man, by pulling hard, is trying to force a boat against
the stream of a strong current he must either stem the rush of the
torrent by the force of his arms, and so mount to what is higher up, or
letting his hands slacken be whirled headlong down stream. Wherefore it
will be a clear proof of our failure if we find that we have gained
nothing more, nor should we doubt but that we have altogether gone back,
whenever we find that we have not advanced upwards, because, as I said,
the mind of man cannot possibly continue in the same condition, nor so
long as he is in the flesh will any of the saints ever reach the height
of all virtues, so that they continue unalterable. For something must
either be added to them or taken away from them, and in no creature can
there be such perfection, as not to be subject to the feeling of change;
as we read in the book of Job: “What is man that he should be without
spot, and he that is born of a woman that he should appear just? Behold
among His saints none is unchangeable, and the heavens are not pure in
His sight.” <span id="fr_1428"></span>[1429](#fn_1428.md) For we confess
that God only is unchangeable, who alone is thus addressed by the prayer
of the holy prophet “But Thou art the same,” <span
id="fr_1429"></span>[1430](#fn_1429.md) and who says of Himself “I am God,
and I change not,” <span id="fr_1430"></span>[1431](#fn_1430.md) because He
alone is by nature always good, always full and perfect, and one to whom
nothing can ever be added, or from whom nothing can be taken away. And
so we ought always with incessant care and anxiety to give ourselves up
to the acquirement of virtue, and constantly to occupy ourselves with
the practice of it, lest, if we cease to go forward, the result should
immediately be a going back. For, as we said, the mind cannot continue
in one and the same condition, I mean without receiving addition to or
diminution of its good qualities. For to fail to gain new ones, is to
lose them, because when the desire of making progress ceases, there the
danger of going back is present.
