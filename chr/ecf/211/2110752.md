#### <span id="iv.iv.ix.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VIII.

<span id="iv.iv.ix.viii-p1"></span>Of the fall of the devil and the
angels.

<span id="iv.iv.ix.viii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.ix.viii-p2.1"></span>And</span> so we are clearly shown that
out of that number of them some of the leaders fell, by the lamentations
of Ezekiel and Isaiah, in which we know that the prince of Tyre or that
Lucifer who rose in the morning is lamented with a doleful plaint: and
of him the Lord speaks as follows to Ezekiel: “Son of man, take up a
lamentation over the prince of Tyre, and say to him: Thus saith the Lord
God: Thou wast the seal of resemblance, full of wisdom, perfect in
beauty. Thou wast in the pleasures of the paradise of God: every
precious stone was thy covering: the sardius, the topaz and the jasper,
the chrysolyte and the onyx and the beryl, the sapphire and the
carbuncle and the emerald: gold the work of thy beauty, and thy pipes
were prepared in the day that thou wast created. Thou wast a cherub
stretched out and protecting, and I set thee in the holy mountain of
God, thou hast walked in the midst of the stones of fire. Thou wast
perfect in thy ways from the day of thy creation, until iniquity was
found in thee. By the multitude of thy merchandise thy inner parts were
filled with iniquity and thou hast sinned; and I cast thee out from the
mountain of God, and destroyed thee, O covering cherub, out of the midst
of the stones of fire. And thy heart was lifted up with thy beauty: thou
hast lost thy wisdom in thy beauty, I have cast thee to the ground: I
have set thee before the face of kings, that they might behold thee.
Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thy iniquities and
by the iniquity of thy traffic.” <span
id="fr_1529"></span>[1530](#fn_1529.md) Isaiah also says of another: “How
art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, who didst rise in the morning?
how art thou fallen to the ground, that didst wound the nations? and
thou saidst in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my
throne above the stars of God, I will sit in the mountain of the
covenant, in the sides of the north. I will ascend above the heights of
the clouds. I will be like the Most High.” <span
id="fr_1530"></span>[1531](#fn_1530.md) But Holy Scripture relates that
these fell not alone from that summit of their station in bliss, as it
tells us that the dragon dragged down together with himself the third
part of the stars. <span id="fr_1531"></span>[1532](#fn_1531.md) One of the
Apostles too says still more plainly: “But the angels who kept not their
first estate, but left their own dwelling, He hath reserved in
everlasting chains under darkness to the judgment of the great
day.” <span id="fr_1532"></span>[1533](#fn_1532.md) This too which is said
to us: “But ye shall die like men and fall like one of the
princes,” <span id="fr_1533"></span>[1534](#fn_1533.md) what does it imply
but that many princes have fallen? And by these testimonies we can
gather the reason for this diversity; viz., either that they still
retain those differences of rank (which adverse powers are said to
possess, after the manner of holy and heavenly virtues) from the station
of their former rank in which they were severally created, or else that,
though themselves cast down from heavenly places, yet, as a reward for
that wickedness of theirs in which they have graduated in evil, they
claim in perversity these grades and titles of rank among themselves, by
way of copying those virtues which have stood firm there.
