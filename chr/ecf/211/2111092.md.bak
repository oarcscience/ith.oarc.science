#### <span id="iv.vii.ii.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.

<span id="iv.vii.ii.iii-p1"></span>He describes the pestilent error of
the Pelagian.

<span id="iv.vii.ii.iii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.ii.iii-p2.1"></span>At</span> any rate we think that this
fact ought not to be omitted, which was special and peculiar to that
heresy mentioned above which sprang from the error of Pelagius; viz.,
that in saying that Jesus Christ had lived as a mere man without any
stain of sin, they actually went so far as to declare that men could
also be without sin if they liked. For they imagined that it followed
that if Jesus Christ being a mere man was without sin, all men also
could without the help of God be whatever He as a mere man without
participating in the Godhead, could be. And so they made out that there
was no difference between any man and our Lord Jesus Christ, as any man
could by effort and striving obtain just the same as Christ had obtained
by His earnestness and efforts. Whence it resulted that they broke out
into a more grievous and unnatural madness, and said that our Lord Jesus
Christ had come into this world not to bring redemption to mankind but
to give an example of good works, to wit, that men, by following His
teaching, and by <span id="page_553">p. 553</span> <span
id="iv.vii.ii.iii-Page_553"></span>walking along the same path of
virtue, might arrive at the same reward of virtue: thus destroying, as
far as they could, all the good of His sacred advent and all the grace
of Divine redemption, as they declared that men could by their own lives
obtain just that which God had wrought by dying for man’s salvation.
They added as well that our Lord and Saviour became the Christ after His
Baptism, and God after His Resurrection, tracing the former to the
mystery of His anointing, the latter to the merits of His Passion.
Whence this new author <span id="fr_2369"></span>[2370](#fn_2369.md) of a
heresy that is not new, who declares that our Lord and Saviour was born
a mere man, observes that he says exactly the same thing which the
Pelagians said before him, and allows that it follows from his error
that as he asserts that our Lord Jesus Christ lived as a mere man
entirely without sin, so he must maintain in his blasphemy that all men
can of themselves be without sin, nor would he admit that our Lord’s
redemption was a thing needful for His example, since men can (as they
say) reach the heavenly kingdom by their own exertions. Nor is there any
doubt about this, as the thing itself shows us. For hence it comes that
he encourages the complaints of the Pelagians by his intervention, and
introduces their case into his writings, because he cleverly or (to
speak more truly) cunningly patronizes them and by his wicked liking for
them recommends their mischievous teaching which is akin to his own, for
he is well aware that he is of the same opinion and of the same spirit,
and therefore is distressed that a heresy akin to his own has been cast
out of the church, as he knows that it is entirely allied to his own in
wickedness.
