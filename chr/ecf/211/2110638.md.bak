#### <span id="iv.iv.iv.xx-p0.1"></span>Chapter XX.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xx-p1"></span>That nothing can be done in this world
without God.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xx-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.iv.xx-p2.1"></span>But</span> it is right for us to hold with
unswerving faith that nothing whatever is done in this world without
God. For we must acknowledge that everything is done either by His will
or by His permission, i.e., we must believe that whatever is good is
carried out by the will of God and by His aid, and whatever is the
reverse is done by His permission, when the Divine Protection is
withdrawn from us for our sins and the hardness of our hearts, and
suffers the devil and the shameful passions of the body to lord it over
us. And the words of the Apostle most assuredly teach us this, when he
says: “For this cause God delivered them up to shameful passions:” and
again: “Because they did not like to have God in their knowledge, God
delivered them up to a reprobate sense, to do those things which are not
convenient.” <span id="fr_1280"></span>[1281](#fn_1280.md) And the Lord
Himself says by the prophet: “But My people did not hear My voice and
Israel did not obey me: Wherefore I gave them up unto their own hearts’
lusts. They shall walk after their own inventions.” <span
