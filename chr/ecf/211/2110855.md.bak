#### <span id="iv.v.iv.xiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIV.

<span id="iv.v.iv.xiv-p1"></span>How God makes trial of the strength of
man’s will by means of his temptations.

<span id="iv.v.iv.xiv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.iv.xiv-p2.1"></span>And</span> this too we read that the Divine
righteousness provided for in the case of Job His well tried athlete,
when the devil had challenged him to single combat. For if he had
advanced against his foe, not with his own strength, but solely with the
protection of God’s grace; and, supported only by Divine aid without any
virtue of patience on his own part, had borne that manifold weight of
temptations and losses, contrived with all the cruelty of his foe, how
would the devil have repeated with some justice <span id="page_431">p.
431</span> <span id="iv.v.iv.xiv-Page_431"></span>that slanderous speech
which he had previously uttered: “Doth Job serve God for nought? Hast
Thou not hedged him in, and all his substance round about? but take away
thine hand,” i.e., allow him to fight with me in his own strength, “and
he will curse Thee to Thy face.” <span
id="fr_1834"></span>[1835](#fn_1834.md) But as after the struggle the
slanderous foe dare not give vent to any such murmur as this, he admired
that he was vanquished by his strength and not by that of God; although
too we must not hold that the grace of God was altogether wanting to
him, which gave to the tempter a power of tempting in proportion to that
which it knew that he had of resisting, without protecting him from his
attacks in such a way as to leave no room for human virtue, but only
providing for this; viz., that the most fierce foe should not drive him
out of his mind and overwhelm him when weakened, with unequal thoughts
and in an unfair contest. But that the Lord is sometimes wont to tempt
our faith that it may be made stronger and more glorious, we are taught
by the example of the centurion in the gospel, in whose case though the
Lord knew that He would cure his servant by the power of His word, yet
He chose to offer His bodily presence, saying: “I will come and heal
him:” but when the centurion overcame this offer of His by the ardour of
still more fervent faith, and said: “Lord, I am not worthy that Thou
shouldest come under my roof: but speak the word only and my servant
shall be healed,” the Lord marvelled at him and praised him, and put him
before all those of the people of Israel who had believed, saying:
“Verily, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith in
Israel.” <span id="fr_1835"></span>[1836](#fn_1835.md) For there would have
been no ground for praise or merit, if Christ had only preferred in him
what He Himself had given. And this searching trial of faith we read
that the Divine righteousness brought about also in the case of the
grandest of the patriarchs; where it is said: “And it came to pass after
these things that God did tempt Abraham.” <span
id="fr_1836"></span>[1837](#fn_1836.md) For the Divine righteousness wished
to try not that faith with which the Lord had inspired him, but that
which when called and enlightened by the Lord he could show forth by his
own free will. Wherefore the firmness of his faith was not without
reason proved, and when the grace of God, which had for a while left him
to prove him, came to his aid, it was said: “Lay not thine hand on the
lad, and do nothing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest the Lord,
and for my sake hast not spared thy beloved son.” <span
id="fr_1837"></span>[1838](#fn_1837.md) And that this kind of temptation
can befall us, for the sake of proving us, is sufficiently clearly
foretold by the giver of the Law in Deuteronomy: “If there rise in the
midst of you a prophet or one that saith he hath seen a dream, and
foretell a sign and wonder; and that come to pass which he spoke, and he
say to thee: Let us go and serve strange gods which ye know not, thou
shalt not hear the words of that prophet or dreamer; for the Lord your
God surely trieth thee, whether thou lovest Him with all thine heart,
and keepest His Commandments, or no.” <span
id="fr_1838"></span>[1839](#fn_1838.md) What then follows? When God has
permitted that prophet or dreamer to arise, must we hold that He will
protect those whose faith He is purposing to try, in such a way as to
leave no place for their own free will, where they can fight with the
tempter with their own strength? And why is it necessary for them even
to be tried if He knows them to be so weak and feeble as not to be able
by their own power to resist the tempter? But certainly the Divine
righteousness would not have permitted them to be tempted, unless it
knew that there was within them an equal power of resistance, by which
they could by an equitable judgment be found in either result either
guilty or worthy of praise. To the same effect also is this which the
Apostle says: “Therefore let him that thinketh he standeth, take heed
lest he fall. There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common
to man. But God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above
that ye are able, but will with the temptation make also a way of escape
that ye may be able to bear it.” <span
id="fr_1839"></span>[1840](#fn_1839.md) For when he says “Let him that
standeth take heed lest he fall” he sets free will on its guard, as he
certainly knew that, after grace had been received, it could either
stand by its exertions or fall through carelessness. But when he adds:
“there hath no temptation taken you but what is common to man” he chides
their weakness and the frailty of their heart that is not yet
strengthened, as they could not yet resist the attacks of the hosts of
spiritual wickedness, against which he knew that he and those who were
perfect daily fought; of which also he says to the Ephesians: “For we
wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against
powers, against the world-rulers of this darkness, against spiritual
wickedness in heavenly places.” <span
id="fr_1840"></span>[1841](#fn_1840.md) But when he subjoins: “But God is
faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able,”
he certainly is not hoping that the Lord will not suffer them to be
tempted, but that they may not be tempted above what they are able to
bear. For the one shows the power of man’s will, <span id="page_432">p.
432</span> <span id="iv.v.iv.xiv-Page_432"></span>the other denotes the
grace of the Lord who moderates the violence of temptations. In all
these phrases then there is proof that Divine grace ever stirs up the
will of man, not so as to protect and defend it in all things in such a
way as to cause it not to fight by its own efforts against its spiritual
adversaries, the victor over whom may set it down to God’s grace, and
the vanquished to his own weakness, and thus learn that his hope is
always not in his own courage but in the Divine assistance, and that he
must ever fly to his Protector. And to prove this not by our own
conjecture but by still clearer passages of Holy Scripture let us
consider what we read in Joshuah the son of Nun: “The Lord,” it says,
“left these nations and would not destroy them, that by them He might
try Israel, whether they would keep the commandments of the Lord their
God, and that they might learn to fight with their enemies.” <span
id="fr_1841"></span>[1842](#fn_1841.md) And if we may illustrate the
incomparable mercy of our Creator from something earthly, not as being
equal in kindness, but as an illustration of mercy: if a tender and
anxious nurse carries an infant in her bosom for a long time in order
sometime to teach it to walk, and first allows it to crawl, then
supports it that by the aid of her right hand it may lean on its
alternate steps, presently leaves it for a little and if she sees it
tottering at all, catches hold of it, and grabs at it when falling, when
down picks it up, and either shields it from a fall, or allows it to
fall lightly, and sets it up again after a tumble, but when she has
brought it up to boyhood or the strength of youth or early manhood, lays
upon it some burdens or labours by which it may be not overwhelmed but
exercised, and allows it to vie with those of its own age; how much more
does the heavenly Father of all know whom to carry in the bosom of His
grace, whom to train to virtue in His sight by the exercise of free
will, and yet He helps him in his efforts, hears him when he calls,
leaves him not when he seeks Him, and sometimes snatches him from peril
even without his knowing it.
