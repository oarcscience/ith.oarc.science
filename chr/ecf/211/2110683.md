#### <span id="iv.iv.vi.xx-p0.1"></span>Chapter XX.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.xx-p1"></span>Of the nature of gluttony, which may be
illustrated by the simile of the eagle.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.xx-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.vi.xx-p2.1"></span>An</span> admirable illustration of this
passion, with which a monk, however spiritual and excellent, is sure to
be hampered, is found in the simile of the eagle. For this bird when in
its flight on high it has soared above the highest clouds, and has
withdrawn itself from the eyes of all mortals and from the face of the
whole earth, is yet compelled by the needs of the belly to drop down and
descend to the earth and feed upon carrion and dead bodies. And this
clearly shows that the spirit of gluttony cannot be altogether
extirpated like all other faults, nor be entirely destroyed like them,
but that we can only hold down and check by the power of the mind all
incentives to it and all superfluous appetites.
