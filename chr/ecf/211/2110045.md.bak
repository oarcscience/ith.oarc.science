#### <span id="ii.iv.i.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VIII.

<span id="ii.iv.i.viii-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.i.viii-p1.1"></span>Accordingly</span>, setting out from that
place, I made for the town of Bethlehem, which is six miles distant from
Jerusalem, but requires sixteen stoppages <span
id="fr_94"></span>[95](#fn_94.md) on the part of one journeying from
Alexandria. The presbyter Jerome <span id="fr_95"></span>[96](#fn_95.md)
rules the church of this place; for it is a parish of the bishop who has
possession of Jerusalem. Having already in my former journey become
acquainted with Hieronymus, he had easily brought it about that I with
good reason deemed no one more worthy of my regard and love. For,
besides the merit due to him on account of his Faith, and the possession
of many virtues, he is a man learned not only in Latin and Greek, but
also Hebrew, to such a degree that no one dare venture to compare
himself with him in all knowledge. I shall indeed be surprised if he is
not well known to you also through means of the works which he has
written, since he is, in fact, read the whole world over.”

<span id="ii.iv.i.viii-p4"></span>“Well,” says the Gaul at this point,
“he is, in truth, but too well known to us. For, some five years ago, I
read a certain book of his, in which the whole tribe of our monks is
most vehemently assaulted and reviled by him. For this reason, our
Belgian friend is accustomed to be very angry, because he has said that
we are in the habit of cramming ourselves even to repletion. But I, for
my part, pardon the eminent man; and am of opinion that he had made the
remark rather about Eastern than Western monks. For <span
id="page_28">p. 28</span> <span id="ii.iv.i.viii-Page_28"></span>the
love of eating is gluttony in the case of the Greeks, whereas among the
Gauls it is owing to the nature they possess.”

<span id="ii.iv.i.viii-p5"></span>Then exclaimed I, “You defend your
nation, my Gallic friend, by means of rhetoric; but I beg to ask whether
that book condemns only this vice in the case of the monks?”

<span id="ii.iv.i.viii-p6"></span>“No indeed,” replies he; “the writer
passed nothing over, which he did not blame, scourge, and expose: in
particular, he inveighed against avarice and no less against arrogance.
He discoursed much respecting pride, and not a little about
superstition; and I will freely own that he seemed to me to draw a true
picture of the vices of multitudes.”
