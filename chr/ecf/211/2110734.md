#### <span id="iv.iv.viii.xxv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXV.

<span id="iv.iv.viii.xxv-p1"></span>On the fact that those men are more
wretched who are possessed by sins than those who are possessed by
devils.

<span id="iv.iv.viii.xxv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.viii.xxv-p2.1"></span>Although</span> it is a fact that those
men are more grievously and severely troubled, who, while they seem to
be very little affected by them in the body, are yet possessed in spirit
in a far worse way, as they are entangled in their sins and lusts. For
as the Apostle says: “Of whom a man is overcome, of him he is also the
servant.” Only that in this respect they are more dangerously ill,
because though they are their slaves, yet they do not know that they are
assaulted by them, and under their dominion. But we know that even
saintly men have been given over in the flesh to Satan and to great
afflictions for some very slight faults, since the Divine mercy will not
suffer the very least spot or stain to be found in them on the day of
judgment, and purges away in this world every spot of their filth, as
the prophet, or rather God Himself says, in order that He may commit
them to eternity as gold or silver refined and needing no penal
purification. “And,” says He, “I will clean purge away thy dross, and I
will take away all thy sin; and after this thou shalt be called the city
of the just, a faithful city.” And again: “Like as silver and gold are
tried in the furnace, so the Lord chooseth the hearts;” And again: “The
fire tries gold and silver; but man is tried in the furnace of
humiliation;” and this also: “For whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth,
and scourgeth every son whom He receiveth.” <span
