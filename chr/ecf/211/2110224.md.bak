#### <span id="ii.vi.ii.xxxv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXV.

<span id="ii.vi.ii.xxxv-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.vi.ii.xxxv-p1.1"></span>Such</span> were the things accomplished
by Helena, while, under a Christian prince, the world had both attained
to liberty, and possessed in him an exemplar of faith. But a far more
dreadful danger than all that had preceded fell upon all the churches
from that state of tranquillity. For then the Arian heresy burst forth,
and disturbed the whole world by the error which it instilled. For by
means of the two <span id="fr_363"></span>[364](#fn_363.md) Ariuses, who
were the most active originators of this unfaithfulness, the emperor
himself was led astray; and while he seemed to himself to fulfill a
religious duty, he proceeded to a violent exercise of persecution. The
bishops were driven into exile: cruelty was exerted against the clerics;
and even the laity were punished, who had separated from the communion
of the Arians. Now, the doctrines which the Arians proclaimed were of
the following nature,—that God the Father had begotten his Son for the
purpose of creating the world; and that, by his power, he had made <span
id="fr_364"></span>[365](#fn_364.md) out of nothing into a new and second
substance, a new and second God; and that there was a time when the Son
had no existence. To meet this evil, a synod was convened from the whole
world to meet at Nicæa. Three hundred and eighteen bishops were there
assembled: the faith was fully set forth in writing; the Arian heresy
was condemned; and the emperor confirmed the whole by an imperial
decree. The Arians, then, not daring to make any further attempt against
the orthodox faith, mixed themselves among the churches, as if they
acquiesced in the conclusions which had been reached, and did not hold
any different opinions. <span id="page_114">p. 114</span> <span
id="ii.vi.ii.xxxv-Page_114"></span>There remained, however, in their
hearts, a deep-seated hatred against the Catholics, and they assailed,
with suborned accusers and trumped-up charges, those with whom they
could not contend in argument on matters of faith.

<span id="ii.vi.ii.xxxv-p2"></span> The one of these was Arius, the
author of the heresy, and the other a presbyter of Alexandria bearing
the same name.

<span id="fn_364"></span>[113:365](2110224.htm#fr_364.md) <span
id="ii.vi.ii.xxxv-p2.1"></span>

<span id="ii.vi.ii.xxxv-p3"></span> Both the text and meaning are here
obscure. We have read, with Halm, “fecisse” for the usual “factum.”
