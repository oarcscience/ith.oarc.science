#### <span id="iv.iii.xii.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.

<span id="iv.iii.xii.vi-p1"></span>That the sin of pride is last in the
actual order of the combat, but first in time and origin.

<span id="iv.iii.xii.vi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.xii.vi-p2.1"></span>And</span> so it is most clearly
established by instances and testimonies from Scripture that the
mischief of pride, although it comes later in the order of the combat,
is yet earlier in origin, and is the beginning of all sins and faults:
nor is it (like the other vices) simply fatal to the virtue opposite to
it (in this case, humility), but it is also at the same time destructive
of *all* virtues: nor does it only tempt ordinary folk and small people,
but chiefly those who already stand on the heights of valour. <span
id="fr_1020"></span>[1021](#fn_1020.md) For thus the prophet speaks of this
spirit, “His meat is choice.” <span id="fr_1021"></span>[1022](#fn_1021.md)
And so the blessed David, although he guarded the recesses of his heart
with the utmost care, so that he dared to say to Him from whom the
secrets of his conscience were not hid, “Lord, my heart is not exalted,
nor are my eyes lofty: neither have I walked in great matters, nor in
wonderful things above me. If I was not humbly minded;” <span
id="fr_1022"></span>[1023](#fn_1022.md) and again, “He that worketh pride
shall not dwell in the midst of my house;” <span
id="fr_1023"></span>[1024](#fn_1023.md) yet, as he knew how hard is that
watchfulness even for those that are perfect, he did not so presume on
his own efforts, but prayed to God and implored His help, that he might
escape unwounded by the darts of this foe, saying, “Let not the foot of
pride come to me,” <span id="fr_1024"></span>[1025](#fn_1024.md) for he
feared and dreaded falling into that which is said of the proud, viz.,
“God resisteth the proud;” <span id="fr_1025"></span>[1026](#fn_1025.md)
and again: “Every one that exalteth his heart is unclean before the
Lord.” <span id="fr_1026"></span>[1027](#fn_1026.md)
