#### <span id="iv.iv.vi.i-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.i-p1"></span>Our arrival at Abbot Serapion’s cell,
and inquiry on the different kinds of faults and the way to overcome
them.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.i-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.vi.i-p2.1"></span>In</span> that assembly of Ancients and
Elders was a man named Serapion, <span
id="fr_1311"></span>[1312](#fn_1311.md) especially endowed with the grace
of discretion, whose Conference I think it is worth while to set down in
writing. For when we entreated him to discourse of the way to overcome
our faults, so that their origin and cause might be made clearer to us,
he thus began.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.i-p3"></span> Serapion when young was a pupil of
Theonas, and an anecdote of his youthful indulgence in good things in
secret has been already told in II. c. xi. Another story of him is given
in XVIII. xi. One of this name is mentioned by Palladius in the Lausiac
History, c. lxxvi., and by Rufinus in the History of the Monks, c.
xviii., where we are told that he lived at Arsinöe, and that he had ten
thousand monks subject to his rule; a number which Sozomen also gives
(H.E. VI. xxviii.). It is however, doubtful whether this Serapion of
Arsinöe is the person whose Conference Cassian here gives. Gazet
identifies, Tillemont distinguishes the two. Jerome, it should be
noticed, speaks in Ep. cviii.<span id="iv.iv.vi.i-p3.1"></span>
(Epitaphium Paulæ) as if there was not only one of this name famous
among the monks of Egypt at that time.
