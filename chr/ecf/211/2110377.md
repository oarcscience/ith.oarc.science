<span id="iv.iii.v.iv"></span>

#### <span id="iv.iii.v.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.

<span id="iv.iii.v.iv-p1"></span>The testimony of Abbot Antony in which
he teaches that each virtue ought to be sought for from him who
professes it in a special degree.

<span id="iv.iii.v.iv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.v.iv-p2.1"></span>For</span> it is an ancient and excellent
saying of the blessed Antony <span id="fr_822"></span>[823](#fn_822.md)
that when a monk is endeavouring after the plan of the monastic life to
reach the heights of a more advanced perfection, and, having learned the
consideration of discretion, is able now to stand in his own judgment,
and to arrive at the very summit of the anchorite’s life, he ought by no
means to seek for all kinds of virtues from one man however excellent.
For one is adorned with flowers of knowledge, another is more strongly
fortified with methods of discretion, another is established in the
dignity of patience, another excels in the virtue of humility, another
in that of continence, another is decked with the grace of simplicity.
<span id="page_235">p. 235</span> <span
id="iv.iii.v.iv-Page_235"></span>This one excels all others in
magnanimity, that one in pity, another in vigils, another in silence,
another in earnestness of work. And therefore the monk who desires to
gather spiritual honey, ought like a most careful bee, to suck out
virtue from those who specially possess it, and should diligently store
it up in the vessel of his own breast: nor should he investigate what
any one is lacking in, but only regard and gather whatever virtue he
has. For if we want to gain all virtues from some one person, we shall
with great difficulty or perhaps never at all find suitable examples for
us to imitate. For though we do not as yet see that even Christ is made
“all things in all,” as the Apostle says; <span
id="fr_823"></span>[824](#fn_823.md) still in this way we can find Him bit
by bit in all. For it is said of Him, “Who was made of God to you wisdom
and righteousness and sanctification and redemption.” <span
id="fr_824"></span>[825](#fn_824.md) While then in one there is found
wisdom, in another righteousness, in another sanctification, in another
kindness, in another chastity, in another humility, in another patience,
Christ is at the present time divided, member by member, among all of
the saints. But when all come together into the unity of the faith and
virtue, He is formed into the “perfect man,” <span
id="fr_825"></span>[826](#fn_825.md) completing the fulness of His body, in
the joints and properties of all His members. Until then that time
arrives when God will be “all in all,” for the present God can in the
way of which we have spoken be “in all,” through particular virtues,
although He is not yet “all in all” through the fulness of them. For
although our religion has but one end and aim, yet there are different
ways by which we approach God, as will be more fully shown in the
Conferences of the Elders. <span id="fr_826"></span>[827](#fn_826.md) And
so we must seek a model of discretion and continence more particularly
from those from whom we see that those virtues flow forth more
abundantly through the grace of the Holy Spirit; not that any one can
alone acquire those things which are divided among many, but in order
that in those good qualities of which we are capable we may advance
towards the imitation of those who especially have acquired them.
