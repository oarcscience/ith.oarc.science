#### <span id="iv.iii.iv.xxii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXII.

<span id="iv.iii.iv.xxii-p1"></span>The system of the Egyptians, which
is appointed for the daily service of the brethren.

<span id="iv.iii.iv.xxii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.iv.xxii-p2.1"></span>These</span> things have been told in
accordance with the system, as we remarked before, of the whole East,
which also we say should be observed as a matter of course in our own
country. But among the Egyptians whose chief care is for work there is
not the mutual change of weekly service, for fear lest owing to the
requirements of office they might all be hindered from keeping the rule
of work. But one of the most approved brethren is given the care of the
larder and kitchen, and he takes charge of that office for good and all
as long as his strength and years permit. For he is exhausted by no
great bodily labour, because no great care is expended among them in
preparing food or in cooking, as they so largely make use of dried and
uncooked food, <span id="fr_779"></span>[780](#fn_779.md) and among them
the leaves of leeks cut each month, and cherlock, table salt, <span
id="fr_780"></span>[781](#fn_780.md) olives, tiny little salt fish which
they call sardines, <span id="fr_781"></span>[782](#fn_781.md) form the
greatest delicacy.

<span id="iv.iii.iv.xxii-p3"></span> The distinction between the
xerophagia and omophagia is shown by the following passage from S.
Jerome’s Life of Hilarion describing his food: “From his twenty-first
year to his twenty-seventh for three years.…his food was dry bread and
water (xerophagia). Further from his twenty-seventh to his thirtieth
year he supported himself on wild herbs, and the raw roots of certain
plants (omophagia).”

<span id="iv.iii.iv.xxii-p4"></span> *Sal frictum*, “rubbed salt,” i.e.,
table salt as distinct from rough or block salt.

<span id="fn_781"></span>[226:782](2110351.htm#fr_781.md) <span
id="iv.iii.iv.xxii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.iv.xxii-p5"></span> *Mœnomenia* (Petschenig) or Mœnidia
(Gazæus). The word comes from the Greek <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iii.iv.xxii-p5.1"></span>μαινόμενα</span> or <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.iii.iv.xxii-p5.2"></span>μαινίδιον</span>,
dimin. from <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iii.iv.xxii-p5.3"></span>μαίνη</span>, a small salted fish.
