#### <span id="iv.iii.i.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VIII.

<span id="iv.iii.i.viii-p1"></span>Of the Staff of the Egyptians.

<span id="iv.iii.i.viii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.i.viii-p2.1"></span>For</span> Elisha, himself one of them,
teaches that the same men used to carry a staff; as he says to Gehazi,
his servant, when sending him to raise the woman’s son to life: “Take my
staff and run and go and place it on the lad’s face that he may
live.” <span id="fr_659"></span>[660](#fn_659.md) And the prophet <span
id="page_204">p. 204</span> <span
id="iv.iii.i.viii-Page_204"></span>would certainly not have given it to
him to take unless he had been in the habit of constantly carrying it
about in his hand. And the carrying of the staff spiritually teaches
that they ought never to walk unarmed among so many barking dogs of
faults and invisible beasts of spiritual wickedness (from which the
blessed David, in his longing to be free, says: “Deliver not, O Lord, to
the beasts the soul that trusteth in Thee”), <span
id="fr_660"></span>[661](#fn_660.md) but when they attack them they ought
to beat them off with the sign of the cross and drive them far away; and
when they rage furiously against them they should annihilate them by the
constant recollection of the Lord’s passion and by following the example
of His mortified life.
