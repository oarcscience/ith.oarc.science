#### <span id="iv.v.ii.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.

<span id="iv.v.ii.iv-p1"></span>Of Abbot Chæremon and his excuse about
the teaching which we asked for.

<span id="iv.v.ii.iv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.ii.iv-p2.1"></span>And</span> so the blessed Archebius thought
it best to take us first to Chæremon, <span
id="fr_1689"></span>[1690](#fn_1689.md) because he was nearer to his
monastery, and because he was more advanced than the other two in age:
for he had passed the hundredth year of his life, vigorous only in
spirit, but with his back bowed with age and constant prayer, so that,
as if he were once more in his childhood he crawled with his hands
hanging down and resting on the ground. Gazing then at one and the same
time on this man’s wonderful face and on his walk (for though all his
limbs had already failed and were dead yet he had lost none of the
severity of his previous strictness) when we humbly asked for the word
and doctrine, and declared that longing for spiritual instruction was
the only reason for our coming, he sighed deeply and said: What doctrine
can I teach you, I in whom the feebleness of age has relaxed my former
strictness, as it has also destroyed my confidence in speaking? For how
could I presume to teach what I do not do, or instruct another in what I
know I now practise but feebly and coldly? Wherefore I do not allow any
of the younger men to live with me now that I am of such an advanced
age, lest the other’s strictness should be relaxed owing to my example.
For the authority of a teacher will never be strong unless he fixes it
in the heart of his hearer by the actual performance of his duty.

whom a short account is given in the Lausiac History of Palladius, c.
xcii.
