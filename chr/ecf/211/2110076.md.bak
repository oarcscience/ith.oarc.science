#### <span id="ii.iv.ii.xi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XI.

<span id="ii.iv.ii.xi-p1"></span>“<span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.ii.xi-p1.1"></span>A certain</span> soldier had renounced the
military <span id="fr_122"></span>[123](#fn_122.md) life in the Church,
having professed himself a monk, and had erected a cell for himself at a
distance in the desert, as if with the purpose of leading the life of an
eremite. But in course of time the crafty adversary harassed his
unspiritual <span id="fr_123"></span>[124](#fn_123.md) nature with various
thoughts, to the effect that, changing his mind, he should express a
desire that his wife, whom Martin had ordered to have a place in the
nunnery <span id="fr_124"></span>[125](#fn_124.md) of the young women,
should rather dwell along with him. The courageous eremite, therefore,
visits Martin, and makes known to him what he had in his mind. But
Martin denied very strongly that a woman could, in inconsistent fashion,
be joined again to a man who was now a monk, and not a husband. At last,
when the soldier was insisting on the point in question; asserting that
no evil would follow from carrying out his purpose; that he simply
desired to possess the solace of his wife’s company; and that there was
no fear of his again returning to his own <span id="page_44">p.
44</span> <span id="ii.iv.ii.xi-Page_44"></span>pursuits; adding that he
was a soldier of Christ, and that she also had taken the oath of
allegiance in the same service; and that the bishop therefore should
allow to serve as soldiers together people who were saints, and who, in
virtue of their faith, totally ignored the question of sex,—then Martin
(I am going to repeat his very words to you) exclaimed: ‘Tell me if you
have ever been in war, and if you have ever stood in the line of
battle?’ In answer he said, ‘Frequently; I have often stood in line of
battle, and been present in war.’ On this Martin replies: ‘Well, then,
tell me, did you ever in a line which was prepared with arms for battle,
or, having already advanced near, was fighting against a hostile army
with drawn sword—did you ever see any woman standing there, or
fighting?’ Then at length the soldier became confused and blushed, while
he gave thanks that he had not been permitted to follow his own evil
counsel, and at the same time had not been put right by the use of any
harsh language, but by a true and rational analogy, connected with the
person of a soldier. Martin, for his part, turning to us (for a great
crowd of brethren had surrounded him), said: ‘Let not a woman enter the
camp of men, but let the line of soldiers remain separate, and let the
females, dwelling in their own tent, be remote from that of men. For
this renders an army ridiculous, if a female crowd is mixed with the
regiments of men. Let the soldier occupy the line, let the soldier fight
in the plain, but let the woman keep herself within the protection of
the walls. She, too, certainly has her own glory, if, when her husband
is absent, she maintains her chastity; and the first excellence, as well
as completed victory of that, is, that she should not be seen.’
