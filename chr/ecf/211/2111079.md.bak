#### <span id="iv.vi.viii.xix-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIX.

<span id="iv.vi.viii.xix-p1"></span>The answer on the devil’s illusion,
because he promises us the peace of a vaster solitude.

<span id="iv.vi.viii.xix-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.viii.xix-p2.1"></span>Abraham</span>: Never to be resorted to
by men at all is a sign of an unreasonable and ill-considered
strictness, or rather of the greatest coldness. For if a man walks in
this way, on which he has entered, with too slow steps, and lives
according to the former man, it is right that none—I say not of the
saints—but of any men should visit him. But you, if you are inflamed
with true and perfect love of our Lord, and follow God, who indeed is
love, with entire fervour of spirit, are sure to be <span
id="page_540">p. 540</span> <span
id="iv.vi.viii.xix-Page_540"></span>resorted to by men, to whatever
inaccessible spot you may flee, and, in proportion as the ardour of
divine love brings you nearer to God, so will a larger concourse of
saintly brethren flock to you. For, as the Lord says, “A city set on an
hill cannot be hid,” <span id="fr_2320"></span>[2321](#fn_2320.md) because
“them that love Me,” saith the Lord, “will I honour, and they that
despise Me shall be contemned.” <span
id="fr_2321"></span>[2322](#fn_2321.md) But you ought to know that this is
the subtlest device of the devil, this is his best concealed pitfall,
into which he precipitates some wretched and heedless persons, so that,
while he is promising them greater things, he takes away the requisite
advantages of their daily profit, by persuading them that more remote
and raster deserts should be sought, and by portraying them in their
heart as if they were sown with marvellous delights. And further some
unknown and non-existent spots, he feigns to be well-known and suitable
and already given over to our power and able to be secured without any
difficulty. The men also of that country he feigns to be docile and
followers of the way of salvation, that, while he is promising richer
fruits for the soul there, he may craftily destroy our present profits.
For when owing to this vain hope each one separates himself from living
together with the Elders and has been deprived of all those things that
he idly imagined in his heart, he rises as it were from a most profound
slumber, and when awake will find nothing of those things of which he
had dreamed. And so as he is hampered by larger requirements for this
life and inextricable snares, the devil will not even allow him to
aspire to those things which he had once promised himself, and as he is
liable no longer to those rare and spiritual visits of the brethren
which he had formerly avoided, but to daily interruptions from worldly
folk, he will never suffer him to return even to the moderate quiet and
system of the anchorite’s life.
