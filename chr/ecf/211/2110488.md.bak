#### <span id="iv.iii.x.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.

<span id="iv.iii.x.iii-p1"></span>Of the different ways in which accidie
overcomes a monk.

<span id="iv.iii.x.iii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.x.iii-p2.1"></span>And</span> so the wretched soul,
embarrassed by such contrivances of the enemy, is disturbed, until, worn
out by the spirit of accidie, as by some strong battering ram, it either
learns to sink into slumber, or, driven out from the confinement of its
cell, accustoms itself to seek for consolation under these attacks in
visiting some brother, only to be afterwards weakened the more by this
remedy which it seeks for the present. For more frequently and more
severely will the enemy attack one who, when the battle is joined, will
as he well knows immediately turn his back, and whom he sees to look for
safety neither in victory nor in fighting but in flight: until little by
little he is drawn away from his cell, and begins to forget the object
of his profession, which is nothing but meditation and contemplation of
that divine purity which excels all things, and which can only be gained
by silence and continually remaining in the cell, and by meditation, and
so the soldier of Christ becomes a runaway from His service, and a
deserter, and “entangles himself in secular business,” without at all
pleasing Him to whom he engaged himself. <span
