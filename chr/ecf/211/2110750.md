#### <span id="iv.iv.ix.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.

<span id="iv.iv.ix.vi-p1"></span>Of the fact that nothing is created
evil by God.

<span id="iv.iv.ix.vi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.ix.vi-p2.1"></span>God</span> forbid that we should admit that
God has created anything which is substantially evil, as Scripture says
“everything that God had made was very good.” <span
id="fr_1525"></span>[1526](#fn_1525.md) For if they were created by God
such as they are now, or made for this purpose; viz., to occupy these
positions of malice, and ever to be ready for the deception and ruin of
men, we should in opposition to the view of the above quoted Scripture
slander God as the Creator and author of evil, as having Himself formed
utterly evil wills and natures, creating them for this very purpose;
viz., that they might ever persist in their wickedness and never pass
over to the feeling of a good will. The following reason then of this
diversity is what we received from the tradition of the fathers, being
drawn from the fount of Holy Scripture.
