#### <span id="iv.v.vii.xx-p0.1"></span>Chapter XX.

<span id="iv.v.vii.xx-p1"></span>Of the feigned patience of some who
offer the other cheek to be smitten.

<span id="iv.v.vii.xx-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.vii.xx-p2.1"></span>We</span> are not ignorant also of another
kind of insanity, which we find in some of the brethren under colour of
a counterfeit patience, as in this case it is not enough to have stirred
up quarrels unless they incite them with irritating words so as to get
themselves smitten, and when they have been touched by the slightest
blow, at once they offer another part of their body to be smitten, as if
in this way they could fulfil to perfection that command which says: “If
a man smite thee on the right cheek, offer him the other also;” <span
id="fr_1996"></span>[1997](#fn_1996.md) while they totally ignore the
meaning and purpose of the passage. For they fancy that they are
practising evangelical patience through the sin of anger, for the utter
eradication of which not only was the exchange of retaliation and the
irritation of strife forbidden, but the command was actually given us to
mitigate the wrath of the striker by the endurance of a double wrong.
