#### <span id="iv.iii.viii.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.

<span id="iv.iii.viii.ix-p1"></span>Of the anger which should be
directed against ourselves.

<span id="iv.iii.viii.ix-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.viii.ix-p2.1"></span>And</span> some are commanded to “be
angry” after a wholesome fashion, but with our own selves, and with evil
thoughts that arise, and “not to sin,” viz., by bringing them to a bad
issue. Finally, the next verse explains this to be the meaning more
clearly: “The things you say in your hearts, be sorry for them on your
beds:” <span id="fr_932"></span>[933](#fn_932.md) i.e., whatever you think
of in your hearts when sudden and nervous excitements rush in on you,
correct and amend with wholesome sorrow, lying as it were on a bed of
rest, and removing by the moderating influence of counsel all noise and
disturbance of wrath. Lastly, the blessed Apostle, when he made use of
the testimony of this verse, and said, “Be ye angry and sin not,” added,
“Let not the sun go down upon your wrath, neither give place to the
devil.” <span id="fr_933"></span>[934](#fn_933.md) If it is dangerous for
the sun of righteousness to go down upon our wrath, and if when we are
angry we straightway give place to the devil in our hearts, how is it
that above he charges us to be angry, saying, “Be ye angry, and sin
not”? Does he not evidently mean this: be ye angry with your faults and
your tempers, lest, if you acquiesce in them, Christ, the sun of
righteousness, may on account of your anger begin to go down on your
darkened minds, and when He departs you may furnish a place for the
devil in your hearts?
