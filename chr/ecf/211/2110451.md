#### <span id="iv.iii.viii.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.

<span id="iv.iii.viii.iii-p1"></span>Of those things which are spoken of
God anthropomorphically.

<span id="iv.iii.viii.iii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.viii.iii-p2.1"></span>For</span> if when these things are
said of God they are to be understood literally in a material gross
signification, then also He *sleeps*, as it is said, “Arise, wherefore
sleepest thou, O Lord?” <span id="fr_919"></span>[920](#fn_919.md) though
it is elsewhere said of Him: “Behold he that keepeth Israel shall
neither slumber nor sleep.” <span id="fr_920"></span>[921](#fn_920.md) And
He *stands* and *sits*, since He says, “Heaven is my seat, and earth the
footstool for my feet:” <span id="fr_921"></span>[922](#fn_921.md) though
He “measure out the heaven with his hand, and holdeth the earth in his
fist.” <span id="fr_922"></span>[923](#fn_922.md) And He is “drunken with
wine” as it is said, “The Lord awoke like a sleeper, a mighty man,
drunken with wine;” <span id="fr_923"></span>[924](#fn_923.md) He “who only
hath immortality and dwelleth in the light which no man can approach
unto:” <span id="fr_924"></span>[925](#fn_924.md) not to say anything of
the “ignorance” and “forgetfulness,” of which we often find mention in
Holy Scripture: nor lastly of the outline of His limbs, which are spoken
of as arranged and ordered like a man’s; e.g., the hair, head, nostrils,
eyes, face, hands, arms, fingers, belly, and feet: if we are willing to
take all of which according to the bare literal sense, we must think of
God as in fashion with the outline of limbs, and a bodily form; which
indeed is shocking even to speak of, and must be far from our thoughts.
