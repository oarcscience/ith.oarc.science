#### <span id="iv.vi.viii.xiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIII.

<span id="iv.vi.viii.xiii-p1"></span>A story of a barber’s payments,
introduced for the sake of recognizing the devil’s illusions.

<span id="iv.vi.viii.xiii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.viii.xiii-p2.1"></span>For</span> as you hope that you can
save others also, and are eager to return to your country with the hope
of greater gain, hear also on this subject a story of Abbot Macarius,
very neatly and prettily invented, which he also gave to a man in a
tumult of similar desires, to cure him by a most appropriate story.
“There was,” said he, “in a certain city a very clever barber, who used
to shave everybody for three pence and by getting this poor and wretched
sum for his work, out of this same amount used to procure what was
required for his daily food, and after having taken all care of his
body, used every day to put a hundred pence into his pocket. But while
he was diligently amassing this gain, he heard that in a city a long way
off each man paid the barber a shilling as his pay. And when he found
this out, ‘how long,’ said he, ‘shall I be satisfied with this beggary,
so as to get with my labour a pay of three pence, when by going thither
I might amass riches by a large gain of shillings?’ And so at once
taking with him the implements of his art, and using up in the expense
all that he had got together and saved during a long time, he made his
way with great difficulty to that most lucrative city. And there on the
day of his arrival, he received from everyone the pay for his labour in
accordance with what he had heard, and at eventide seeing that he had
gained a large number of shillings he went in delight to the butcher’s
to buy the food he wanted for his supper. And when he began to purchase
it for a large sum of shillings he spent on a tiny bit of meat all the
shillings that he had gained, and did not take home a surplus of even a
single penny. And when he saw that his gains were thus used up every day
so that he not only failed to put by anything but could scarcely get
what he required for his daily food, he thought over the matter with
himself and said: ‘I will go back to my city, and once more, seek those
very moderate profits, from which, when all my bodily wants were
satisfied, a daily surplus gave a growing sum to support my old age;
which, though it seemed small and trifling, yet by being constantly
increased was amounting to no slight sum. In fact that gain of coppers
was more profitable to me than is this nominal one of shillings from
which not only is there nothing over to be laid by, but the necessities
of my daily food are scarcely met.’” And therefore it is better for us
with unbroken continuance to aim at this very slender profit in the
desert, from which no secular cares, no worldly distractions, no pride
of vainglory and vanity can detract, and which the pressure of no daily
wants can lessen (for “a small thing that the righteous hath is better
than great riches of the ungodly” <span
id="fr_2311"></span>[2312](#fn_2311) .md) rather than to pursue those
larger profits which even if they are procured by the most valuable
conversion of many, are yet absorbed by the claims of secular life and
the daily leakage of distractions. For, as Solomon says, “Better is a
single handful with rest than both hands full with labour and vexation
of mind.” <span id="fr_2312"></span>[2313](#fn_2312.md) And in these
allusions and inconveniences all that are at all weak are sure to be
entangled, as while they are even doubtful of their own salvation, and
themselves stand in need of the teaching and instruction of others, they
are incited by the devil’s tricks to convert and guide others, and as,
even if they succeed in gaining any advantage from the conversion of
some, they waste by their impatience and rude manners whatever they have
gained. For that will happen to them which is described by the prophet
Haggai: “And he that gathereth riches, putteth them into a bag with
holes.” <span id="fr_2313"></span>[2314](#fn_2313.md) For indeed a man puts
his gains into a bag with holes, if he loses by want of self control and
daily distractions of mind whatever he appears to gain by the conversion
of others. And so it results that while they fancy that they can make
larger profits by the instruction of others, they are actually deprived
of their own improvement. For “There are who make themselves out rich
though possessing nothing, and there are who humble themselves amid
great riches;” and: “Better is a <span id="page_538">p. 538</span> <span
id="iv.vi.viii.xiii-Page_538"></span>man who serves himself in a humble
station than one who gains honour for himself and wanteth bread.” <span
id="fr_2314"></span>[2315](#fn_2314.md)
