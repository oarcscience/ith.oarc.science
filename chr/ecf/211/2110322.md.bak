<span id="iv.iii.iii.vi"></span>

#### <span id="iv.iii.iii.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.

<span id="iv.iii.iii.vi-p1"></span>How no change was made by the Elders
in the ancient system of Psalms when the Mattin office was instituted.

<span id="iv.iii.iii.vi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.iii.vi-p2.1"></span>But</span> this too we ought to know,
viz., that no change was made in the ancient arrangement of Psalms by
our Elders who decided that this Mattin service should be added; <span
id="fr_740"></span>[741](#fn_740.md) but that office <span
id="fr_741"></span>[742](#fn_741.md) was always celebrated in their
nocturnal assemblies according to the same order as it had been before.
For the hymns which in this country they used at the Mattin service at
the close of the nocturnal vigils, which they are accustomed to finish
after the cock-crowing and before dawn, these they still sing in like
manner; viz., [Ps. 148](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#000.md)<span
id="iv.iii.iii.vi-p4.1"></span>, beginning “O praise the Lord from
heaven,” and the rest which follow; but the 50th Psalm and the 62nd, and
the 89th have, we know, been assigned to this new service. Lastly,
throughout Italy at this day, when the Mattin hymns are ended, the 50th
Psalm is sung in all the churches, which I have no doubt can only have
been derived from this source.

id="iv.iii.iii.vi-p2.2"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.iii.vi-p3"></span> I.e., Prime. Some confusion is
likely to be caused by the fact that Cassian speaks of both “Lauds” and
“Prime” by the same title of Mattins. Immediately below, where he speaks
of the “Mattin service at the close of the nocturnal vigils” he is
referring to Lauds, which always followed immediately (or after a very
short interval) after Nocturns, or Mattins. At this service [Psa.
148-150](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#000.md)<span
id="iv.iii.iii.vi-p3.1"></span>. have always been sung, indeed, they
form the characteristic feature which gives the service its name of
“Lauds” (<span class="Greek"><span id="iv.iii.iii.vi-p3.2"></span>οἱ
ἆινοι</span>). Of the other three [Ps.
51:0](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#000.md), [Ps.
63:0](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#000.md), [Ps.
90:0](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#000.md)<span
id="iv.iii.iii.vi-p3.3"></span>, which Cassian says had been transferred
from Lauds to the newly instituted service of Prime, [Psa.
63](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#000.md)<span
id="iv.iii.iii.vi-p3.4"></span> has been already spoken of as a morning
hymn of the early Church (see the notes on c. iii.), and we learn from
S. Basil that in his day [Psa. 51](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#000.md)<span
id="iv.iii.iii.vi-p3.5"></span> (<span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iii.iii.vi-p3.6"></span>ὁ</span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iii.iii.vi-p3.7"></span>τἠς ἐξομολογήσεως ψαλμός</span>) was
regularly sung after Mattins when the day began to break (*Ep.
ccvii.<span id="iv.iii.iii.vi-p3.8"></span>* *ad clericos Neo-Cæs*.),
and it is still a Lauds Psalm in both East and West. [Psa.
90](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#000.md)<span
id="iv.iii.iii.vi-p3.9"></span> is now one of the fixed Psalms at Prime
in the East, but in the West it is, according to the Roman rule, sung at
Lauds on Thursdays only. Thus it would appear that the transfer of these
three Psalms from Lauds to Prime, of which Cassian speaks, never
obtained widely, but that the older arrangement, whereby, at any rate,
[Ps. 51:0](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#000.md), [Ps.
63:0](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#000.md)<span
id="iv.iii.iii.vi-p3.10"></span> were assigned to Lauds, has generally
been adhered to both in the East and West. Cf. the Rule of S. Benedict,
according to which [Psa. 51](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#000.md)<span
id="iv.iii.iii.vi-p3.11"></span> is sung daily at Lauds, and [Psa.
63](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#000.md)<span
id="iv.iii.iii.vi-p3.12"></span> as well on Sundays (c. xii., xiii.).

the end of the first Psalm is not allowed to enter the Oratory; but at
Nocturnes a late arrival up to the end of the second Psalm can be
overlooked.](2110323.md)
