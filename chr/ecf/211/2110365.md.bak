#### <span id="iv.iii.iv.xxxvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXVI.

<span id="iv.iii.iv.xxxvi-p1"></span>How our renunciation of the world
is of no use if we are again entangled in those things which we have
renounced.

<span id="iv.iii.iv.xxxvi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.iv.xxxvi-p2.1"></span>Beware</span> therefore lest at any
time you take again any of those things which you renounced and forsook,
and, contrary to the Lord’s command, return from the field of
evangelical work, and be found to have clothed yourself again in your
coat which you had stripped off; <span id="fr_801"></span>[802](#fn_801.md)
neither sink back to the low and earthly lusts and desires of this
world, and in defiance of Christ’s word come down from the rod of
perfection and dare to take up again any of those things which you have
renounced and forsaken. Beware that you remember nothing of your
kinsfolk or of your former affections, and that you are not called back
to the cares and anxieties of this world, and (as our Lord says) putting
your hand to the plough and looking back be found unfit for the kingdom
of heaven. <span id="fr_802"></span>[803](#fn_802.md) Beware lest at any
time, when you have begun to dip into the knowledge of the Psalms and of
this life, you be little by little puffed up and think of reviving that
pride which now at your beginning you have trampled under foot in the
ardour of faith and in fullest humility; and thus (as the Apostle says)
building again those things which you had destroyed, you make yourself a
backslider. <span id="fr_803"></span>[804](#fn_803.md) But rather take heed
to continue even to the end in that state of nakedness of which you made
profession in the sight of God and of his angels. In this humility too
and patience, with which you persevered for ten days before the doors
and entreated with many tears to be admitted into the monastery, you
should not only continue but also increase and go forward. For it is too
bad that when you ought to be carried on from the rudiments and
beginnings, and go forward to perfection, you should begin to fall back
from these to worse things. For not he who begins these things, but he
who endures in them to the end, shall be saved. <span
