#### <span id="ii.vi.i.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.

<span id="ii.vi.i.vi-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.vi.i.vi-p1.1"></span>At</span> the same time God spoke to
Abraham, and promised that his seed was to be multiplied as the sand of
the sea; and that his predicted seed would live in a land not his own,
while his posterity would endure slavery in a hostile country for four
hundred years, but would afterwards be restored to liberty. Then his
name was changed, as well as that of his wife, by the addition of one
letter; so that instead of Abram <span id="fr_256"></span>[257](#fn_256.md)
he was called Abraham, and, instead of Sara, she was called Sarra. The
mystery involved in this is by no means trifling, but it is not the part
of this work to treat of it. At the same time, the law of circumcision
was enjoined on Abraham, and he had by a maid-servant a son called
Ishmael. Moreover, when he himself was a hundred years old, and his wife
ninety, God promised that they should have a son Isaac, the Lord having
come to him along with two angels. Then the angels being sent to Sodom,
found Lot sitting in the gate of the city. He supposed them to be human
beings, and welcomed them to share in his hospitality, and provided an
entertainment for them in his house, but the wicked youth of the town
demanded the new arrivals for impure purposes. Lot offered them his
daughters in place of his guests, but they did not accept the offer,
having a desire rather for things forbidden, and then Lot himself was
laid hold of with vile designs. The angels, however, speedily rescued
him from danger, by causing blindness to fall upon the eyes of these
unchaste sinners. Then Lot, being informed by his guests that the town
was to be destroyed, went away from it with his wife and daughters; but
they were commanded not to look back upon it. His wife, however, not
obeying this precept (in accordance with that evil tendency of human
nature which renders it difficult to abstain from things forbidden),
turned back her eyes, and is said to have been at once changed into a
monument. As for Sodom, it was burned to ashes by fire from heaven. And
the daughters of Lot, imagining that the whole human race had perished,
sought a union with their father while he was intoxicated, and hence
sprung the race of Moab and Ammon.

<span id="ii.vi.i.vi-p2"></span> In the Greek of the LXX. the name
appears as *Abraam*, so that, as our author says, there is only a change
of one letter.
