#### <span id="ii.ii.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.

<span id="ii.ii.iii-p1"></span>Military Service of St. Martin.

<span id="ii.ii.iii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.ii.iii-p2.1"></span>Martin</span>, then, was born at
Sabaria <span id="fr_2"></span>[3](#fn_2.md) in Pannonia, but was brought
up at Ticinum, <span id="fr_3"></span>[4](#fn_3.md) which is situated in
Italy. His parents were, according to the judgment of the world, of no
mean rank, but were heathens. His father was at first simply a soldier,
but afterwards a military tribune. He himself in his youth following
military pursuits was enrolled in the imperial guard, first under king
Constantine, and then under Julian Cæsar. This, however, was not done of
his own free will, for, almost from his earliest years, the holy infancy
of the illustrious boy aspired rather to the service of God. <span
id="fr_4"></span>[5](#fn_4.md) For, when he was of the age of ten years, he
betook himself, against the wish of his parents, to the Church, and
begged that he might become a catechumen. Soon afterwards, becoming in a
wonderful manner completely devoted to the service of God, when he was
twelve years old, he desired to enter on the life of a hermit; and he
would have followed up that desire with the necessary vows, had not his
as yet too youthful age prevented. His mind, however, being always
engaged on matters pertaining to the monasteries or the Church, already
meditated in his boyish years what he afterwards, as a professed servant
of <span id="page_5">p. 5</span> <span
id="ii.ii.iii-Page_5"></span>Christ, fulfilled. But when an edict was
issued by the ruling powers <span id="fr_5"></span>[6](#fn_5.md) in the
state, that the sons of veterans should be enrolled for military
service, and he, on the information furnished by his father, (who looked
with an evil eye on his blessed actions) having been seized and put in
chains, when he was fifteen years old, was compelled to take the
military oath, then showed himself content with only one servant as his
attendant. And even to him, changing places as it were, he often acted
as though, while really master, he had been inferior; to such a degree
that, for the most part, he drew off his \[servant’s\] boots and cleaned
them with his own hand; while they took their meals together, the real
master, however, generally acting the part of servant. During nearly
three years before his baptism, he was engaged in the profession of
arms, but he kept completely free from those vices in which that class
of men become too frequently involved. He showed exceeding kindness
towards his fellow-soldiers, and held them in wonderful affection; while
his patience and humility surpassed what seemed possible to human
nature. There is no need to praise the self-denial which he displayed:
it was so great that, even at that date, he was regarded not so much as
being a soldier as a monk. By all these qualities he had so endeared
himself to the whole body of his comrades, that they esteemed him while
they marvelously loved him. Although not yet made a new creature <span
id="fr_6"></span>[7](#fn_6.md) in Christ, he, by his good works, acted the
part of a candidate for baptism. This he did, for instance, by aiding
those who were in trouble, by furnishing assistance to the wretched, by
supporting the needy, by clothing the naked, while he reserved nothing
for himself from his military pay except what was necessary for his
daily sustenance. Even then, far from being a senseless hearer of the
Gospel, he so far complied with its precepts as to take no thought about
the morrow.

<span id="ii.ii.iii-p5"></span> The text is here corrupt and uncertain,
but the general meaning is plain to the above effect. Hahn has adopted
“divinam servitutem,” instead of the common “divina servitute.”

<span id="fn_5"></span>[5:6](2110006.htm#fr_5.md) <span
id="ii.ii.iii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ii.ii.iii-p6"></span> Sulpitius uses *reges* instead of the
more common expression *imperatores.*

<span id="fn_6"></span>[5:7](2110006.htm#fr_6.md) <span
id="ii.ii.iii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="ii.ii.iii-p7"></span> Sulpitius manifestly refers to baptism
in these words. However mistakenly, several others of the early Fathers
held that regeneration does not take place before baptism, and that
baptism is, in fact, absolutely necessary to regeneration. St. Ambrose
has the following strong statement on the subject: “Credit catechumenus;
sed nisi baptizetur, remissionem peccatorum non potest obtinere.”—*Libri
de his, qui initiantur mysteriis*, chap. 4.
