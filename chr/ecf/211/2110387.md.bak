#### <span id="iv.iii.v.xiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIV.

<span id="iv.iii.v.xiv-p1"></span>How gluttonous desires can be
overcome.

<span id="iv.iii.v.xiv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.v.xiv-p2.1"></span>First</span> then we must trample under
foot gluttonous desires, and to this end the mind must be reduced not
only by fasting, but also by vigils, by reading, and by frequent
compunction of heart for those things in which perhaps it recollects
that it has been deceived or overcome, sighing at one time with horror
at sin, at another time inflamed with the desire of perfection and
saintliness: until it is fully occupied and possessed by such cares and
meditations, and recognizes the participation of food to be not so much
a concession to pleasure, as a burden laid upon it; and considers it to
be rather a necessity for the body than anything desirable for the soul.
And, preserved by this zeal of mind and continual compunction, we shall
beat down the wantonness of the flesh (which becomes more proud and
haughty by being fomented with food) and its dangerous incitement, and
so by the copiousness of our tears and the weeping of our heart we shall
succeed in extinguishing the fiery furnace of our body, which is kindled
by the Babylonish king <span id="fr_837"></span>[838](#fn_837.md) who
continually furnishes us with opportunities for sin, and vices with
which we burn more fiercely, instead of naphtha and pitch—until, through
the grace of God, instilled like dew by His Spirit in our hearts, the
heats of fleshly lusts can be altogether deadened. This then is our
first contest, this is as it were our first trial in the Olympic games,
to extinguish the desires of the palate and the belly by the longing for
perfection. On which account we must not only trample down all
unnecessary desire for food by the contemplation of the virtues, but
also must take what is necessary for the support of nature, not without
anxiety of heart, as if it were opposed to chastity. And so at length we
may enter on the course of our life, so that there may be no time in
which we feel that we are recalled from our spiritual studies, further
than when we are obliged by the weakness of the body to descend for the
needful care of it. And when we are subjected to this necessity—of
attending to the wants of life rather than the desires, of the soul—we
should hasten to withdraw as quickly as possible from it, as if it kept
us back from really health-giving studies. For we cannot possibly scorn
the gratification of food presented to us, unless the mind is fixed on
the contemplation of divine things, and is the rather <span
id="page_239">p. 239</span> <span
id="iv.iii.v.xiv-Page_239"></span>entranced with the love of virtue and
the delight of things celestial. And so a man will despise all things
present as transitory, when he has securely fixed his mental gaze on,
those things which are immovable and eternal, and already contemplates
in heart—though still in the flesh—the blessedness of his future life.
