<p> <a name="iv.v.iv.v"></A>  <h4 align="center"><a name="iv.v.iv.v-p0.1"></A>Chapter V.</h4>  
<p class="subh"><a name="iv.v.iv.v-p1"></A>The answer on the imaginary chastity of the philosophers.</p>  
<p class="skip"><a name="iv.v.iv.v-p2"></A><span class="sc"><a name="iv.v.iv.v-p2.1"></A>Ch&aelig;remon</span>: I am pleased that, though you are fired with the greatest longing to know the truth, yet you bring forward some foolish points, as by your raising these objections the value of the Catholic faith may seem better established, and if I may use the expression, more thoroughly explored. For what wise man would make such contradictory statements as yesterday to maintain that the heavenly purity of chastity could not possibly even by God&#146;s grace be bestowed on any mortals, and now to hold that it was obtained even by the heathen by their own strength? But as you have certainly, as I said, made these objections from the desire of getting at the truth, consider what we hold on these points. First we certainly must not think that the philosophers attained such chastity of soul, as is required of us, on whom it is enjoined that not fornication only, but uncleanness be not so much as named among us. But they had a sort of <span class="Greek"><a name="iv.v.iv.v-p2.2"></A>&#956;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#954;&#8053;</span>, i.e., some particle of chastity; viz. continence of the flesh, by which they could restrain their lust from carnal intercourse: but this internal purity of mind and continual purity of body they could not attain, I will not say, in act, but even in thought. Finally Socrates, the most famous of them all, as they themselves esteem him, was not ashamed to profess this of himself. For when one who judged a man&#146;s character by his looks (<span class="Greek"><a name="iv.v.iv.v-p2.3"></A>&#968;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#959;&#947;&#957;&#8061;&#956;&#959;&#953;&#957;</span>) looked at him, and said <span class="Greek"><a name="iv.v.iv.v-p2.4"></A>&#8004;</span><span class="Greek"><a name="iv.v.iv.v-p2.5"></A>&#956;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945; &#960;&#945;&#953;&#948; &#949;&#961;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</span>, i.e., &#8220;the eyes of a corrupter of boys,&#8221; and his scholars rushed at him, and brought him to their master and wanted to avenge the insult, it is said that he checked their indignation with these words: <span class="Greek"><a name="iv.v.iv.v-p2.6"></A>&#960;&#945;&#8059;&#963;&#945;&#959;&#952;&#949;, &#7952;&#964;&#945;&#8150;&#961;&#959;&#953; &#903; &#949;&#7984;&#956;&#8054; &#947;&#8049;&#961;, &#7952;&#960;&#8051;&#954;&#969; &#948;&#8051;</span>, i.e., Stop, my friends, for I am, but I restrain myself. It is then quite clearly shown not only by our assertions but actually by their own admissions that it was only the performance of indecent acts, i.e., the disgrace of intercourse, that was by force of necessity checked by them, and that the desire and delight in this passion was not shut out from their hearts. But with what horror must one bring forward this saying of Diogenes? For a thing which the philosophers of this world were not ashamed to bring forward as something remarkable, cannot be spoken or heard by us without shame: for to one to be punished for the crime of adultery they relate that he said <span class="Greek"><a name="iv.v.iv.v-p2.7"></A>&#964;&#8056; &#948;&#969;&#961;&#949;&#8048;&#957; &#960;&#969;&#955;&#959;&#8059;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#957; &#952;&#945;&#957;&#8049;&#964;&#969; &#956;&#8052; &#7936;&#947;&#8057;&#961;&#945;&#950;&#949;</span>, i.e., you should not buy with your death what is sold for nothing.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1751"></A><A HREF="#fn_1751"><FONT SIZE="1">1752</FONT></A>
 It is clear then that they did not recognize the virtue of the true chastity which we seek for, and so it is quite certain that our circumcision which is in the spirit cannot be acquired save only by the gift of God, and that it belongs only to those who serve God with full contrition of their spirit.</p>
