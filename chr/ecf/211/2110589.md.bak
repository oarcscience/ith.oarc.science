#### <span id="iv.iv.ii.xxii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXII.

<span id="iv.iv.ii.xxii-p1"></span>Of the fourfold method of
discrimination.

<span id="iv.iv.ii.xxii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.ii.xxii-p2.1"></span>This</span> power of discriminating will
then be necessary for us in the fourfold manner of which we have spoken;
viz., first that the material does not escape our notice whether it be
of true or of painted gold: secondly, that those thoughts which falsely
promise works of religion should be rejected by us as forged and
counterfeit coins, as they are those which are not rightly stamped, and
which bear an untrue image of the king; and that we may be able in the
same way to detect those which in the case of the precious gold of
Scripture, by means of a false and heretical meaning, show the image not
of the true king but of an usurper; and that we refuse those whose
weight and value the rust of vanity has depreciated and not allowed to
pass in the scales of the fathers, as coins that are too light, and are
false and weigh too little; so that we may not incur that which we are
warned by the Lord’s command to avoid with all our power, and lose the
value and reward of all our labour. “Lay not up for yourselves treasures
on the earth, where rust and moth corrupt and where thieves break
through and steal.” <span id="fr_1157"></span>[1158](#fn_1157.md) For
whenever we do anything with a view to human glory we know that we are,
as the Lord says, laying up for ourselves treasure on earth, and that
consequently being as it were hidden in the ground and buried in the
earth it must be destroyed by sundry demons or consumed by the biting
rust of vain glory, or devoured by the moths of pride so as to
contribute nothing to the use and profits of the man who has hidden it.
We should then constantly search all the inner chambers of our hearts,
and trace out the footsteps of whatever enters into them with the
closest investigation lest haply some beast, if I may say so, relating
to the understanding, either lion or dragon, passing through has
furtively left the dangerous marks of his track, which will show to
others the way of access into the secret recesses of the heart, owing to
a carelessness about our thoughts. And so daily and hourly turning up
the ground of our heart with the gospel plough, i.e., the constant
recollection of the Lord’s cross, we shall manage to stamp out or
extirpate from our hearts the lairs of noxious beasts and the lurking
places of poisonous serpents.
