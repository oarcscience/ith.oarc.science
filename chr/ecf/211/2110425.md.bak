#### <span id="iv.iii.vii.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.

<span id="iv.iii.vii.ix-p1"></span>How a monk who has money cannot stay
in the monastery.

<span id="iv.iii.vii.ix-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.vii.ix-p2.1"></span>And</span> so having money to provide for
his wanderings, with the assistance of which he has fitted himself as it
were with wings, and now being quite ready for his move, he answers
impertinently to all commands, and behaves himself like a stranger and a
visitor, and whatever he sees needing improvement, he despises and
treats with contempt. And though he has a supply of money secretly
hidden, yet he complains that he has neither shoes nor clothes, and is
indignant that they are given out to him so slowly. And if it happens
that through the management of the superior some of these are given
first to one who is known to have nothing whatever, he is still more
inflamed with burning rage, and thinks that he is despised as a
stranger; nor is he contented to turn his hand to any work, but finds
fault with everything which the needs of the monastery require to be
done. Then of set purpose he looks out for opportunities of being
offended and angry, lest he might seem to have gone forth from the
discipline of the monastery for a trivial reason. And not content to
take his departure by himself alone, lest it should be thought that he
has left as it were from his own fault, he never stops corrupting as
many as he can by clandestine conferences. But if the severity of the
weather interferes with his journey and travels, he remains all the time
in suspense and anxiety of heart, and never stops sowing and exciting
discontent; as he thinks that he will only find consolation for his
departure and an excuse for his fickleness in the bad character and
defects of the monastery.
