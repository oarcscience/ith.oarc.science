#### <span id="ii.ii.xv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIV.

<span id="ii.ii.xv-p1"></span>Martin destroys Heathen Temples and
Altars.

<span id="ii.ii.xv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.ii.xv-p2.1"></span>Nor</span> did he show less eminence, much
about the same time, in other transactions of a like <span
id="page_11">p. 11</span> <span id="ii.ii.xv-Page_11"></span>kind. For,
having in a certain village set fire to a very ancient and celebrated
temple, the circle of flames was carried by the action of the wind upon
a house which was very close to, yea, connected with, the temple. When
Martin perceived this, he climbed by rapid ascent to the roof of the
house, presenting himself in front of the advancing flames. Then indeed
might the fire have been seen thrust back in a wonderful manner against
the force of the wind, so that there appeared a sort of conflict of the
two elements fighting together. Thus, by the influence of Martin, the
fire only acted in the place where it was ordered to do so. But in a
village which was named Leprosum, when he too wished to overthrow a
temple which had acquired great wealth through the superstitious ideas
entertained of its sanctity, a multitude of the heathen resisted him to
such a degree that he was driven back not without bodily injury. He,
therefore, withdrew to a place in the vicinity, and there for three
days, clothed in sackcloth <span id="fr_29"></span>[30](#fn_29.md) and
ashes fasting and praying the whole time, he besought the Lord, that, as
he had not been able to overthrow that temple by human effort, Divine
power might be exerted to destroy it. Then two angels, with spears and
shields after the manner of heavenly warriors, suddenly presented
themselves to him, saying that they were sent by the Lord to put to
flight the rustic multitude, and to furnish protection to Martin, lest,
while the temple was being destroyed, any one should offer resistance.
They told him therefore to return, and complete the blessed work which
he had begun. Accordingly Martin returned to the village; and while the
crowds of heathen looked on in perfect quiet as he razed the pagan
temple even to the foundations, he also reduced all the altars and
images to dust. At this sight the rustics, when they perceived that they
had been so astounded and terrified by an intervention of the Divine
will, that they might not be found fighting against the bishop, almost
all believed in the Lord Jesus. They then began to cry out openly and to
confess that the God of Martin ought to be worshiped, and that the idols
should be despised, which were not able to help them.
