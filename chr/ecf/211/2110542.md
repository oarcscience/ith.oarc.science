#### <span id="iv.iii.xii.xi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XI.

<span id="iv.iii.xii.xi-p1"></span>The case of the thief and of David,
and of our call in order to illustrate the grace of God.

<span id="iv.iii.xii.xi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.xii.xi-p2.1"></span>For</span> if we recall that thief who
was by reason of a single confession admitted into paradise, <span
id="fr_1049"></span>[1050](#fn_1049.md) we shall feel that he did not
acquire such bliss by the merits of his life, but obtained it by the
gift of a merciful God. Or if we bear in mind those two grievous and
heinous sins of King David, blotted out by one word of penitence, <span
id="fr_1050"></span>[1051](#fn_1050.md) we shall see that neither here were
the merits of his works sufficient to obtain pardon for so great a sin,
but that the grace of God superabounded, as, when the opportunity for
true penitence was taken, He removed the whole weight of sins through
the full confession of but one word. If we consider also the beginning
of the call and salvation of mankind, in which, as the Apostle says, we
are saved not of ourselves, nor of our works, but by the gift and grace
of God, we can clearly see how the whole of perfection is “not of him
that willeth nor of him that runneth, but of God that hath mercy,” who
makes us victorious over our faults, without any merits of works and
life on our part to outweigh them, or any effort of our will availing to
scale the difficult heights of perfection, or to subdue the flesh which
we have to use:  since no tortures of this body, and no contrition of
heart, can be sufficient for the acquisition of that true chastity of
the inner man so as to be able to gain that great virtue of purity
(which is innate in the angels alone and indigenous as it were to
heaven) merely by human efforts, i.e., without the aid of God: for the
performance of everything good flows from His grace, who by multiplying
His bounty has granted such lasting bliss, and vast glory to our feeble
will and short and petty course of life.
