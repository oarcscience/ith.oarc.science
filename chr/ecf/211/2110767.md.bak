<span id="iv.iv.ix.xxiii"></span>

#### <span id="iv.iv.ix.xxiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXIII.

<span id="iv.iv.ix.xxiii-p1"></span>The answer, that by the law of
nature men were from the beginning liable to judgment and punishment.

<span id="iv.iv.ix.xxiii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.ix.xxiii-p2.1"></span>Serenus</span>: God at man’s creation
implanted in him naturally complete knowledge of the law, and if this
had been kept by man, as at the beginning, according to the Lord’s
purposes, there would not have been any need for another law to be
given, which He afterwards proclaimed in writing: for it were
superfluous for an external remedy to be offered, where an internal one
was still implanted and vigorous. But since this had been, as we have
said, utterly corrupted by freedom and the opportunity of sinning, the
severe restrictions of the law of Moses were added as the executor and
vindicator of this (earlier law) and to use the expressions of
Scripture, as its helper, that through fear of immediate punishment men
might be kept from altogether losing the good of natural <span
id="page_385">p. 385</span> <span
id="iv.iv.ix.xxiii-Page_385"></span>knowledge, according to the word of
the prophet who says “He gave the law to help them:” <span
id="fr_1557"></span>[1558](#fn_1557.md) and it is also described by the
Apostle as having been given as a schoolmaster <span
id="fr_1558"></span>[1559](#fn_1558.md) to little children, as it instructs
and guards them to prevent them from departing through sheer
forgetfulness from the teaching in which they had been instructed by the
light of nature: for that the complete knowledge of the law was
implanted in man at his first creation, is clearly proved from this;
viz., that we know that before the law, aye, and even before the flood,
all holy men observed the commands of the law without having the letter
to read. For how could Abel, without the command of the law, have known
that he ought to offer to God a sacrifice of the firstlings of his flock
and of the fat thereof, <span id="fr_1559"></span>[1560](#fn_1559.md)
unless he had been taught by the law which was naturally implanted in
him? How could Noah have distinguished what animals were clean and what
were unclean, <span id="fr_1560"></span>[1561](#fn_1560.md) when the
commandment of the law had not yet made a distinction, unless he had
been taught by a natural knowledge? Whence did Enoch learn how to “walk
with God,” <span id="fr_1561"></span>[1562](#fn_1561.md) having never
acquired any light of the law from another? Where had Shem and Japheth
read “Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father,” so that they
went backwards and covered the shame of their father? <span
id="fr_1562"></span>[1563](#fn_1562.md) How was Abraham taught to abstain
from the spoils of the enemy which were offered to him, that he might
not receive any recompense for his toil, or to pay to the priest
Melchizedec the tithes which are ordered by the law of Moses? <span
id="fr_1563"></span>[1564](#fn_1563.md) How was it too that the same
Abraham and Lot also humbly offered to passers by and strangers offices
of kindness and the washing of their feet, while yet the Evangelic
command had not shone forth? <span id="fr_1564"></span>[1565](#fn_1564.md)
Whence did Job obtain such earnestness of faith, such purity of
chastity, such knowledge of humility, gentleness, pity and kindness, as
we now see shown not even by those who know the gospels by heart? Which
of the saints do we read of as not having observed some commandment of
the law before the giving of the law? Which of them failed to keep this:
“Hear, O Israel, the Lord thy God is one Lord?” <span
id="fr_1565"></span>[1566](#fn_1565.md) Which of them did not fulfil this:
“Thou shalt not make to thyself any graven image, nor the likeness of
anything which is in heaven or in the earth or under the earth?” Which
of them did not observe this: “Honour thy father and thy mother,” or
what follows in the Decalogue: “Thou shalt do no murder; Thou shalt not
commit adultery; Thou shalt not steal; Thou shalt not bear false
witness; Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s wife,” <span
id="fr_1566"></span>[1567](#fn_1566.md) and many other things besides, in
which they anticipated the commands not only of the law but even of the
gospel?
