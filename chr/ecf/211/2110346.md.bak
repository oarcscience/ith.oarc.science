#### <span id="iv.iii.iv.xvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVII.

<span id="iv.iii.iv.xvii-p1"></span>Of those who introduced the plan
that the holy Lessons should be read in the Cœnobia while the brethren
are eating, and of the strict silence which is kept among the Egyptians.

<span id="iv.iii.iv.xvii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.iv.xvii-p2.1"></span>But</span> we have been informed that
the plan that, while the brethren are eating, the holy lessons should be
read in the Cœnobia did not originate in the Egyptian system but in the
Cappadocian. And there is no doubt that they meant to establish it not
so much for the sake of the spiritual exercise as for the sake of
putting a stop to unnecessary and idle conversation, and especially
discussions, which so often arise at meals; since they saw that these
could not be prevented among them in any other way. <span
id="fr_772"></span>[773](#fn_772.md) For among the Egyptians and especially
those of Tabenna so strict a silence is observed by all that when so
large a number of the brethren has sat down together to a meal, no one
ventures to talk even in a low tone except the dean, who however if he
sees that anything is wanted to be put on or taken off the table,
signifies it by a sign rather than a word. And while they are eating,
the rule of this silence is so strictly kept that with their hoods drawn
down over their eyelids (to prevent their roving looks having the
opportunity of wandering inquisitively) they can see nothing except the
table, and the food that is put on it, and which they take from it; so
that no one notices what another is eating. <span

<span id="iv.iii.iv.xvii-p3"></span> It is quite in keeping with what is
here said by Cassian that in the Rule of Pachomius there is no mention
of reading at meals, but only of the strict silence observed, so that
anything wanted might not be asked for but only indicated by a sign (cc.
xxxi., xxxiii.), while in the shorter Monastic Rules of S. Basil the
custom of reading at meals is distinctly alluded to (Q. clxxx.). It is
of course also ordered in most of the later monastic rules, e.g. that of
Cesarius of Arles “ad Monachos” c. xlix., “ad Virgines” c. xvi.; that of
S. Aurelian, c. xlix.; S. Isidore, c. x., and S. Benedict, c. xxxviii.
The regulations in the last mentioned are as follows:—“A book should be
read in the Refectory while the brethren are at meals. Let no one
presume to read of his own accord; but let there be one appointed to
perform that duty, who, commencing on Sunday, will read during the
entire week…Profound silence shall be observed during meals, so that no
voice save that of the reader may be heard. The brethren will so help
each other to what is necessary as regards food and drink that no one
may have occasion to ask for anything; should, however, anything be
wanted, let it be asked for by sign rather than word. Let no one presume
to make any observation either on what is being read or on any other
subject, lest occasion be given to the enemy. The Prior, however, should
he think fit, may say a few words to edify the brethren.”

<span id="iv.iii.iv.xvii-p4"></span> So Pachomius (c. xxix.). While they
are eating they shall sit in their right places and shall cover their
heads.
