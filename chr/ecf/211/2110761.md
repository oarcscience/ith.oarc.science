#### <span id="iv.iv.ix.xvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVII.

<span id="iv.iv.ix.xvii-p1"></span>Of the fact that two angels always
cling to every man.

<span id="iv.iv.ix.xvii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.ix.xvii-p2.1"></span>For</span> Holy Scripture bears witness
that two angels, a good and a bad one, cling to each one of us. And of
the good ones the Saviour says: “Do not despise one of these little
ones; for I say unto you that their angels in heaven do always behold
the face of thy Father which is in heaven:” <span
id="fr_1544"></span>[1545](#fn_1544.md) and this also: “the angel of the
Lord shall encamp round about them that fear Him, and deliver
them.” <span id="fr_1545"></span>[1546](#fn_1545.md) Moreover this also
which is said in <span id="page_382">p. 382</span> <span
id="iv.iv.ix.xvii-Page_382"></span>the Acts of the Apostles, of Peter,
that “it is his angel.” <span id="fr_1546"></span>[1547](#fn_1546.md) But
of both sorts the book of the Shepherd teaches us very fully. <span
id="fr_1547"></span>[1548](#fn_1547.md) But if we consider about him who
attacked the blessed Job we shall clearly learn that it was he who
always plotted against him but never could entice him to sin, and that
therefore he asked for power from the Lord, as he was worsted not by his
(Job’s) virtue but by the Lord’s protection which ever shielded him. Of
Judas also it is said: “And let the devil stand at his right
hand.” <span id="fr_1548"></span>[1549](#fn_1548.md)

<span id="iv.iv.ix.xvii-p6"></span> The reference is to the Pastor or
Shepherd of Hermas, a work of the second century. The passage to which
Cassian alludes is found in Book II. Commandm. vi.; where it is said
that “there are two angels with a man, one of righteousness and the
other of iniquity,” and suggestions are given how to recognize each of
them and to distinguish the suggestions of the one from those of the
other. The passage is also alluded to by Origen, De Principiis, Book
III. c. ii. and Hom. xxxv. in (Lucam); and Cassian refers to it again in
Conf. XIII. c. xii.
