#### <span id="ii.vi.i.xlv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XLV.

<span id="ii.vi.i.xlv-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.vi.i.xlv-p1.1"></span>He</span>, being sick in body, and having
sent some of his servants to consult an idol about his recovery, Elijah,
as instructed by God, met them in the way, and, after rebuking them
ordered them to inform the king that his death would follow from that
disease. Then the king ordered him to be seized and brought into his
presence, but those who were sent for this purpose were consumed by fire
from heaven. The king died, as the prophet had predicted. To him there
succeeded his brother Joram; and he held the government for the space of
twelve years. But on the side of the two tribes, Josaphat the king
having died, Joram his son possessed the kingdom for eighteen years. He
had the daughter of Ahab to wife, and proved himself more like his
father-in-law than his father. After him, Ochozias his son obtained the
kingdom. During his reign, Elijah is related to have been taken up to
heaven. At the same time, <span id="page_93">p. 93</span> <span
id="ii.vi.i.xlv-Page_93"></span>Elisha his disciple showed himself
powerful by working many miracles, which are all too well known to need
any description from my pen. By him the son of a widow was restored to
life, a leper of Syria was cleansed, at a time of famine abundance of
all things was brought into the city by the enemy having been put to
flight, water was furnished for the use of three armies, and from a
little oil the debt of a woman was paid by the oil being immensely
multiplied, and sufficient means for a livelihood was provided for
herself. In his times, as we have said, Ochozia was king of the two
tribes, while Joram, as we have related above, ruled over the ten; and
an alliance was formed between them. For war was carried on by them with
combined forces both against the Syrians, and against Jeu, who had been
anointed by the prophet as king of the ten tribes; and having gone forth
to battle in company, they both perished in the same fight.
