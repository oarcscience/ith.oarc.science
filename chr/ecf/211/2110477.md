#### <span id="iv.iii.ix.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.

<span id="iv.iii.ix.vi-p1"></span>That no one comes to grief by a sudden
fall, but is destroyed by falling through a long course of
carelessness. <span id="fr_957"></span>[958](#fn_957.md)

<span id="iv.iii.ix.vi-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.ix.vi-p3.1"></span>For</span> no one is ever driven to sin by
being provoked through another’s fault, unless he has the fuel of evil
stored up in his own heart. Nor should we imagine that a man has been
deceived suddenly when he has looked on a woman and fallen into the
abyss of shameful lust: but rather that, owing to the opportunity of
looking on her, the symptoms of disease which were hidden and concealed
in his inmost soul have been brought to the surface.
