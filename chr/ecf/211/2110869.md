#### <span id="iv.v.v.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.

<span id="iv.v.v.ix-p1"></span>How from practical knowledge we must
proceed to spiritual.

<span id="iv.v.v.ix-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.v.ix-p2.1"></span>Wherefore</span> if you are anxious to attain
to the light of spiritual knowledge, not wrongly for an idle boast but
for the sake of being made better men, you are first inflamed with the
longing for that blessedness, of which we read: “blessed are the pure in
heart for they shall see God,” <span
id="fr_1883"></span>[1884](#fn_1883) that you may also attain to that of
which the angel said to Daniel: “But they that are learned shall shine
as the splendor of the firmament: and they that turn many to
righteousness as the stars for ever <span id="page_439">p. 439</span>
<span id="iv.v.v.ix-Page_439"></span>and ever;” and in another prophet:
“Enlighten yourselves with the light of knowledge while there is
time.” <span id="fr_1884"></span>[1885](#fn_1884) And so keeping up that
diligence in reading, which I see that you have, endeavour with all
eagerness to gain in the first place a thorough grasp of practical,
i.e., ethical knowledge. For without this that theoretical purity of
which we have spoken cannot be obtained, which those only, who are
perfected not by the words of others who teach them, but by the
excellence of their own actions, can after much expenditure of effort
and toil attain as a reward for it. For as they gain their knowledge not
from meditation on the law but from the fruit of their labour, they sing
with the Psalmist: “From Thy commandments I have understanding;” and
having overcome all their passions, they say with confidence: “I will
sing, and I will understand in the undefiled way.” <span
id="fr_1885"></span>[1886](#fn_1885) For he who is striving in an
undefiled way in the course of a pure heart, as he sings the Psalm,
understands the words which are chanted. And therefore if you would
prepare in your heart a holy tabernacle of spiritual knowledge, purge
yourselves from the stain of all sins, and rid yourselves of the cares
of this world. For it is an impossibility for the soul which is taken up
even to a small extent with worldly troubles, to gain the gift of
knowledge or to become an author of spiritual interpretation, and
diligent in reading holy things. Be careful therefore in the first
place, and especially you, John, as your more youthful age requires you
the rather to be careful about what I am going to say—that you may
enjoin absolute silence on your lips, in order that your zeal for
reading and the efforts of your purpose may not be destroyed by vain
pride. For this is the first practical step towards learning, to receive
the regulations and opinions of all the Elders with an earnest heart,
and with lips that are dumb; and diligently to lay them up in your
heart, and endeavour rather to perform than to teach them. For from
teaching, the dangerous arrogance of vainglory, but from performing, the
fruit of spiritual knowledge will flourish. And so you should never
venture to say anything in the conference of the Elders unless some
ignorance that might be injurious, or a matter which it is important to
know leads you to ask a question; as some who are puffed up with
vainglory, pretend that they ask, in order really to show off the
knowledge which they perfectly possess. For it is an impossibility for
one, who takes to the pursuit of reading with the purpose of gaining the
praise of men, to be rewarded with the gift of true knowledge. For one
who is bound by the chain of this passion, is sure to be also in bondage
to other faults, and especially to that of pride: and so if he is
baffled by his encounter with practical and ethical knowledge, he will
certainly not attain that spiritual knowledge which springs from it. Be
then in all things “swift to hear, but slow to speak,” <span
id="fr_1886"></span>[1887](#fn_1886) lest there come upon you that which
is noted by Solomon: “If thou seest a man who is quick to speak, know
that there is more hope of a fool than of him;” <span
id="fr_1887"></span>[1888](#fn_1887) and do not presume to teach any one
in words what you have not already performed in deed. For our Lord
taught us by His own example that we ought to keep to this order, as of
Him it is said: “what Jesus began to do and to teach.” <span
id="fr_1888"></span>[1889](#fn_1888) Take care then that you do not rush
into teaching before doing, and so be reckoned among the number of those
of whom the Lord speaks in the gospel to the disciples: “What they say
unto you, that observe and do, but not after their words: for they say
and do not. But they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and
lay them on men’s shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with
one of their fingers.” <span id="fr_1889"></span>[1890](#fn_1889) For if
he who shall “break one of these commands, and shall teach men so, shall
be called least in the kingdom of heaven,” <span
id="fr_1890"></span>[1891](#fn_1890) it follows that one who has dared
to despise many and greater commands and to teach men so, shall
certainly be considered not least in the kingdom of heaven, but greatest
in the punishment of hell. And therefore you must be careful not to be
led on to teach by the example of those who have attained some skill in
discussion and readiness in speech and because they can discourse on
what they please elegantly and fully, are imagined to possess spiritual
knowledge, by those who do not know how to distinguish its real force
and character. For it is one thing to have a ready tongue and elegant
language, and quite another to penetrate into the very heart and marrow
of heavenly utterances and to gaze with pure eye of the soul on profound
and hidden mysteries; for this can be gained by no learning of man’s,
nor condition of this world, only by purity of soul, by means of the
illumination of the Holy Ghost.
