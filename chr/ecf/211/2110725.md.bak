to rob, and in the dark shades of night sprinkle with careful hands

cannot see by the tinkling sound with which they answer to the fall of
the sand, and so arrive at certain knowledge of each thing and metal,
which betrays itself in a way by the voice elicited from it; so these
too, in order to explore the treasures of our heart, scatter over us the
sand of certain evil suggestions, and when they see some bodily
affection arise corresponding to their character, they recognize as if
by a sort of tinkling sound proceeding from the inmost recesses, what it
is that is stored up in the secret chamber of the inner man.
