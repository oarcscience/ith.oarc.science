## <span id="iii.xxxvii-p0.1"></span>Appendix III.

<span id="iii.xxxvii-p1"></span>Note on Section 85, Page 156.

<span id="iii.xxxvii-p2"></span>Celestine’s letter was addressed to
certain Bishops of Southern Gaul, who are particularized by name.

<span id="iii.xxxvii-p3"></span>It appears that Prosper and Hilary had
made a journey to Rome, where they then were, for the purpose of
complaining to Celestine of the connivance of certain bishops of
Southern Gaul with the unsound teaching of their clergy. They complained
too of the disrespectful manner in which these same clergy treated the
memory of Augustine, then recently deceased.

<span id="iii.xxxvii-p4"></span>Celestine writes to these bishops:
blames their connivance with a fault, which, says he, by their silence
they make their own, and then proceeds to charge them, as in the passage
quoted in the text, “Rebuke these people: restrain their liberty of
preaching. If the case be so, let novelty cease to assail antiquity, let
restlessness cease to disturb the Church’s peace.” Then, after some
further exhortation, he adds, “We cannot wonder at their thus assailing
the living, when they do not shrink from seeking to asperse the memory
of the departed. With Augustine, whom all men everywhere loved and
honoured, we ever held communion. Let a stop be put to this spirit of
disparagement, which unhappily is on the increase.”

<span id="iii.xxxvii-p5"></span>The manner in which Vincentius deals
with this letter has been very commonly thought, and with reason, to
indicate a Semipelagian leaning. <span id="fr_528"></span>[529](#fn_528)
His “si ita est,” “if the case be so,” emphasized by being repeated
again and again, quite in an excited manner, as we should say, shows an
evident wish to shift the charge of novelty from those against whom it
had been brought, and fix it upon the opposite party. “Who are the
introducers of novelty? The Massilians, as Prosper represents them, or
their calumniators? Not the Massilians: they notoriously appeal to
antiquity,—not the Massilians, but Prosper and the rest of Augustine’s
followers.”

<span id="iii.xxxvii-p7"></span>The feeling with regard to Augustine, on
the part of the Massilian clergy, as indicated in Celestine’s letter, is
quite in accordance with the animus of § 69 above. See the note on that
place, and see Noris’s remarks, pp. 246–248.
