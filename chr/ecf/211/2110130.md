### <span id="ii.v.v-p0.1"></span>Letter V.

#### <span id="ii.v.v-p0.2"></span>To an Unknown Person, Entreating Him to Deal Gently with His Brother.

<span id="ii.v.v-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.v-p1.1"></span>Although</span> my lord and brother has already
begged of your nobleness that you would see that Tutus should be
most <span id="fr_237"></span>[238](#fn_237.md) safe, yet it has been
allowed to me to commend the same person in a letter, in order that, by
the petition being doubled, he may be held all the safer. For let it be
granted that a youthful fault and error of a yet unsettled age has
injured him, so as to inflict a stain on his early years; still one, who
did not yet know what was due to right conduct, <span id="page_69">p.
69</span> <span id="ii.v.v-Page_69"></span>has gone wrong almost without
contracting blame. For when he came to a right state of mind and to
reflection, he understood on better thoughts that a theatrical life was
to be condemned. However, he could not be completely cleared of his
fault, unless he should wash its guilt away by the aid <span
id="fr_238"></span>[239](#fn_238.md) of Deity, since, by the remedy
obtained through the Catholic religion, changing his views, he has
denied himself the enjoyment of a less honorable place, and has
withdrawn himself from the eyes of the people.

<span id="ii.v.v-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.v-p4.1"></span>Of the Master as Above.</span> <span
id="fr_239"></span>[240](#fn_239.md)

<span id="ii.v.v-p6"></span>Since, therefore, both divine and state laws
do not permit a faithful body and sanctified minds to exhibit
disgraceful though pleasing spectacles, and to set forth vulgar means of
enjoyment, especially since an injury seems in some degree to accrue to
the chaste dedication of one’s self, in case any one who has been
renewed by holy baptism should fall back upon his old licentiousness, it
behooves your Excellency to show favor to good intentions, so that he
who, by the goodness of God, has entered on a pious duty, should not be
forced to sink into the pitfall of the theatre. He does not, however,
refuse compliance with the judgment of you all, if you enjoin other
fitting actions on his part in behalf of the requirements of our common
country. <span id="fr_240"></span>[241](#fn_240.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_237"></span>[68:238](2110130.htm#fr_237.md) <span
id="ii.v.v-p1.2"></span>

<span id="ii.v.v-p2"></span> There is a play upon the words—“Tutum esse
tutissimum.”

<span id="fn_238"></span>[69:239](2110130.htm#fr_238.md) <span
id="ii.v.v-p2.1"></span>

<span id="ii.v.v-p3"></span> “divinitatis accessu”: the context is
almost unintelligible.

<span id="fn_239"></span>[69:240](2110130.htm#fr_239.md) <span
id="ii.v.v-p4.2"></span>

<span id="ii.v.v-p5"></span> This probably denotes that what follows is
the substance of the Master’s petition.

<span id="fn_240"></span>[69:241](2110130.htm#fr_240.md) <span
id="ii.v.v-p6.1"></span>

<span id="ii.v.v-p7"></span> Clericus, while accepting most of the
letters with which we are now dealing, doubts, from the difference of
style, whether this is an epistle of Sulpitius. It is certainly very
different from his usual clearness and correctness.
