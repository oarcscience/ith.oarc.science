#### <span id="iv.v.viii.xv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XV.

<span id="iv.v.viii.xv-p1"></span>A question whether it can be without
sin that our knowledge affords to weak brethren an opportunity for
lying.

<span id="iv.v.viii.xv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.viii.xv-p2.1"></span>Germanus</span>: As far as the force of
the words which have been reasonably and carefully considered, is
concerned, our scruple about our promise would have easily been removed
from us were it not that we were terribly alarmed lest by this example
an opportunity for lying might be offered to certain weaker brethren, if
they knew that the faith of an agreement could be in any way lawfully
broken, whereas this very thing is forbidden in such vigorous and
threatening terms by the prophet when he says: “Thou shalt destroy all
those who utter a lie;” and: “the mouth that speaketh a lie, shall slay
the soul.” <span id="fr_2020"></span>[2021](#fn_2020)
