<span id="iv.v.v.xvii"></span>

#### <span id="iv.v.v.xvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVII.

<span id="iv.v.v.xvii-p1"></span>To whom the method of perfection should
be laid open.

<span id="iv.v.v.xvii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.v.xvii-p2.1"></span>Take</span> care too, when your riper age
leads you to teach, lest you be led astray by the love of vainglory, and
teach at random to the most impure persons these things which you have
learnt not so much by reading as by the effects of experience, and so
incur what Solomon, that wisest of men, denounced: “Attach not a wicked
man to the pastures of the just, and be not led astray by the fulness of
the belly,” for “delicacies are not good for a fool, nor is there room
for wisdom where sense is wanting: for folly is the more led on, because
a stubborn servant is not improved by words, for even though he
understands, he will not obey.” And “Do not say anything in the ears of
an imprudent man, lest haply he mock at thy wise speeches.” <span
id="fr_1925"></span>[1926](#fn_1925.md) And “give not that which is holy to
dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest haply they trample
them under foot and turn again and rend you.” <span
id="fr_1926"></span>[1927](#fn_1926.md) It is right then to hide the
mysteries of spiritual meanings from men of this sort, that you may
effectually sing: “Thy words have I hid within my heart: that I should
not sin against Thee.” <span id="fr_1927"></span>[1928](#fn_1927.md) But
you will perhaps say: And to whom are the mysteries of Holy Scripture to
be dispensed? Solomon, the wisest of men, shall teach you: “Give, says
he, strong drink to those who are in sorrow, and give wine to drink, to
those who are in pain, that they may forget their poverty, and remember
their pain no more,” <span id="fr_1928"></span>[1929](#fn_1928.md) i.e., to
those who in consequence of the punishment of their past actions are
oppressed with grief and sorrow, supply richly the joys of spiritual
knowledge like “wine that maketh glad the heart of man,” <span
id="fr_1929"></span>[1930](#fn_1929.md) and restore them with the strong
drink of the word of salvation, lest haply they be plunged in continual
sorrow and a despair that brings death, and so those who are of this
sort be “swallowed up in overmuch sorrow.” <span
id="fr_1930"></span>[1931](#fn_1930.md) But of those who remain in coldness
and carelessness, and are smitten by no sorrow of heart we read as
follows: “For one who is kindly and without sorrow, shall be in
want.” <span id="fr_1931"></span>[1932](#fn_1931.md) With all possible care
therefore avoid being puffed up with the love of vainglory, and so
failing to become a partaker with him whom the prophet praises, “who
hath not given his money upon usury.” <span
id="fr_1932"></span>[1933](#fn_1932.md) For every one who, from love of the
praise of men dispenses the words of God, of which it is said “the words
of the Lord are pure words, as silver tried by the fire, purged from the
earth, refined seven times,” <span id="fr_1933"></span>[1934](#fn_1933.md)
puts out his money upon usury, and will deserve for this not merely no
reward, but rather punishment. For this reason he chose to use up his
Lord’s money that he might be the garner from a temporal profit, and not
that the Lord, as it is written, might “when He comes, receive His own
with usury.” <span id="fr_1934"></span>[1935](#fn_1934.md)
