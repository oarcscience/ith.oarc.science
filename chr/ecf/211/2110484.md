<span id="iv.iii.ix.xiii-p1"></span>The means by which we can root out
dejection from our hearts.

<span id="iv.iii.ix.xiii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.ix.xiii-p2.1"></span>We</span> should then be able to expel
this most injurious passion from our hearts, so that by spiritual
meditation we may keep our mind constantly occupied with hope of the
future and contemplation of the promised blessedness. For in this way we
shall be able to get the better of all those sorts of dejection, whether
those which flow from previous anger or those which come to us from
disappointment of gain, or from some loss, or those which spring from a
wrong done to us, or those which arise from an unreasonable disturbance
of mind, or those which bring on us a deadly despair, if, ever joyful
with an insight into things eternal and future, and continuing
immovable, we are not depressed by present accidents, or over-elated by
prosperity, but look on each condition as uncertain and likely soon to
pass away.
