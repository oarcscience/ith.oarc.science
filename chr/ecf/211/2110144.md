<span id="ii.vi.i.x-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.vi.i.x-p1.1"></span>Israel</span>, therefore, avoiding the house
of his brother, sent forward his company to Salem, a town of the
Shechemites, and there he pitched his tent on a spot which he had
purchased. Emor, a Chorræan prince, was the ruler of that town. His son
Sychem defiled Dinah, the daughter of Jacob by Leah. Symeon and Levi,
the brothers of Dinah, discovering this, cut off by a stratagem all
those of the male sex in the town, and thus terribly avenged the injury
done to their sister. The town was plundered by the sons of Jacob, and
all the spoil carried off. Jacob is said to have been much displeased
with these proceedings. Soon after being instructed by God, he went to
Bethel, and there erected an altar to God. Then he fixed his tent in a
part of the territory belonging to the tower <span

boy she bore was called Benjamin. Israel died at the age of one hundred
and eighty years. Now, Esau was mighty in wealth, and had taken to
himself wives of the nation of the Canaanites. I do not think that, in a
work so concise as the present, I am called upon to mention his
descendants, and, if any one is curious on the subject, he may turn to
the original. After the death of his father, Jacob stayed on in the
place where Isaac had lived. His other sons occasionally left him along
with the flocks, for the sake of pasturage, but Joseph and the little
Benjamin remained at home. Joseph was much beloved by his father, and on
that account was hated by his brethren. There was this further cause for
their aversion, that by frequent dreams of his it seemed to be indicated
that he would be greater than all of them. Accordingly, having been sent
by his father to inspect the flocks and pay a visit to his brothers,
there seemed to them a fitting opportunity for doing him harm. For, on
seeing their brother, they took counsel to slay him. But Reuben, whose
mind shuddered at the contemplation of such a crime, opposing their
plan, Joseph was let down into a well. <span

Judah, they were brought to milder measures, and sold him to merchants,
who were on their way to Egypt. And by them he was delivered to Petifra,
a governor of Pharaoh.

<span id="ii.vi.i.x-p2"></span> “In parte turris Gadir”: this is a
strange rendering of the Hebrew. The LXX has “beyond the tower Gader”;
while the Revised English Version has “beyond the tower of Eder.”
