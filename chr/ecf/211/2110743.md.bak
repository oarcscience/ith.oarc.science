#### <span id="iv.iv.viii.xxxiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXIV.

<span id="iv.iv.viii.xxxiv-p1"></span>The postponement of the answer to
the question raised.

<span id="iv.iv.viii.xxxiv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.viii.xxxiv-p2.1"></span>Serenus</span>: Although your
proposals would rob us of our whole night’s rest, so that we should not
notice the approach of the rising dawn, and should be tempted greedily
to prolong our conference till sunrise, yet since the solving of the
question raised, if we began to trace it out, would launch us on a wide
and deep sea of questions, which the shortness of the time at our
disposal would not permit us to traverse, I think it will be more
convenient to reserve it for consideration another night, when by the
raising of this question I shall receive from your very ready converse
some spiritual joy and richer fruit, and we shall be able if the Holy
Spirit grants us a prosperous breeze to penetrate more freely into the
intricacies of the questions raised. Wherefore let us enjoy a little
sleep, and so shake off the drowsiness that steals over our eyes, as the
dawn approaches, and then we will go together to church, for the
observance of Sunday bids us do this, and after service will come back,
and as you wish, discuss with redoubled delight what the Lord may have
given to us for our common improvement.
