 which are sold there for scarcely threepence, no one thinks that he has a right to anything further. And among them there is nothing (and I am ashamed to say this, and heartily wish it was unknown in our own monasteries) which is claimed by any of them, I will not say in deed but even in thought, as  <A NAME="page_223"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 223</FONT></A> <a name="iv.iii.iv.xiv-Page_223"></A>his special property. And though he believes that the whole granary of the monastery forms his substance, and, as lord of all, devotes his whole care and energy to it all, yet nevertheless, in order to maintain that excellent state of want and poverty which he has secured and which he strives to preserve to the very last in unbroken perfection, he regards himself as a foreigner and an alien to them all, so that he conducts himself as a stranger and a sojourner in this world, and considers himself a pupil of the monastery and a servant instead of imagining that he is lord and master of anything.</p>

The word comes from the Greek <span class="Greek"><a name="iv.iii.iv.xiv-p3.1"></A>&#960;&#945;&#958;&#945;&#956;&#8049;&#948;&#953;&#959;&#957;</span>, and is said to be derived from the name of a baker, <span class="Greek"><a name="iv.iii.iv.xiv-p3.2"></A>&#928;&#945;&#958;&#945;&#956;&#8057;&#962;</span> (see Liddell and Scott, c. v.). These biscuits formed an important part of the diet of the Egyptian monks, as we see from the Conferences, where they are often mentioned; e.g., II. xi, xix., xxiv., xxvi.; XII. xv.; XIX. iv.</p>
