#### <span id="ii.vi.ii.vii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.

<span id="ii.vi.ii.vii-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.vi.ii.vii-p1.1"></span>Those</span>, therefore, who were
possessed of power along with him, stimulated by envy, because a
foreigner belonging to a captive nation had been placed on a footing of
equality with them, constrain the king, who had been corrupted by
flattery, to enact that divine honors should be paid to him for the next
thirty days, and that it should not be lawful for any one to pray to a
god except the king. Darius was easily persuaded to that, through the
folly of all kings who claim for themselves divine honors. In these
circumstances, Daniel being not unacquainted with what had happened, and
not being ignorant that prayer ought to be addressed to God, and not to
man, is accused of not having obeyed the king’s commandment. And much
against the will of Darius, to whom he had always been dear and
acceptable, the rulers prevailed that he should be let down into a
den. <span id="fr_335"></span>[336](#fn_335.md) But no harm came to him
when thus exposed to the wild beasts. And on the king discovering this,
he ordered his accusers to be given over to the lions. They, however,
did not pass through a similar experience, for they were instantly
devoured to satisfy the hunger of the savage beasts. Daniel, who had
been famous before, was now esteemed still more famous; and the king,
repealing his former edict, issued a new one to the effect that, all
errors and superstitions being abandoned, the God of Daniel was to be
worshiped. There exists also a record of visions of Daniel, in which he
revealed the order of events in coming ages, embracing in them also the
number of the years, within which he announced that Christ would descend
to earth (as has taken place), and clearly set forth the future coming
of Antichrist. If any one is eager to inquire into these points, he will
find them more fully treated of in the book of Daniel: our design is
simply to present a connected statement of events. Darius is related to
have reigned eighteen years; after which date Astyages began to rule
over the Medes.
