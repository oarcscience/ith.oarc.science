#### <span id="iv.v.vii.xiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIV.

<span id="iv.v.vii.xiv-p1"></span>On the different grades of love.

<span id="iv.v.vii.xiv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.vii.xiv-p2.1"></span>It</span> is possible then for all to show
that love which is called <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.v.vii.xiv-p2.2"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.v.vii.xiv-p2.3"></span>γάπη</span>, of which the blessed Apostle
says: “While therefore we have time, let us do good unto all men, but
specially to them that are of the household of faith.” <span
id="fr_1981"></span>[1982](#fn_1981.md) And this should be shown to all men
in general to such an extent that we are actually commanded by our Lord
to yield it to our enemies, for He says: “Love your enemies.” <span
id="fr_1982"></span>[1983](#fn_1982.md) But <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.v.vii.xiv-p4.2"></span>διάθεσις</span>, i.e., affection is shown
to but a few and those who are united to us by kindred dispositions or
by a tie of goodness; though indeed affection seems to have many degrees
of difference. For in one way we love our parents, in another our wives,
in another our brothers, in another our children, and there is a wide
difference in regard to the claims of these feelings of affection, nor
is the love of parents towards their children always equal. As is shown
by the case of the patriarch Jacob, who, though he was the father of
twelve sons and loved them all with a father’s love, yet loved Joseph
with deeper affection, as Scripture clearly shows: “But his brethren
envied him, because his father loved him;” <span
id="fr_1983"></span>[1984](#fn_1983.md) evidently not that that good man
his father failed in greatly loving the rest of his children, but that
in his affection he clung to this one, because he was a type of the
Lord, more tenderly and indulgently. This also, we read, was very
clearly shown in the case of John the Evangelist, where these words are
used of him: “that disciple whom Jesus loved,” <span
id="fr_1984"></span>[1985](#fn_1984.md) though certainly He embraced all
the other eleven, whom He had chosen in the same way, with His special
love, as this He shows also by the witness of the gospel, where He says:
“As I have loved you, so do ye also love one another;” of whom elsewhere
also it is said: “Loving His own who were in the world, He loved them
even to the end.” <span id="fr_1985"></span>[1986](#fn_1985.md) But this
love of one in particular did not indicate any coldness in love for the
rest of the disciples, but only a fuller and more abundant love towards
the one, which his prerogative of virginity and the purity of his flesh
bestowed upon him. And therefore it is marked by exceptional treatment,
as being something more sublime, because no hateful comparison with
others, but a richer grace of superabundant love singled it out.
Something of this sort too we have in the character of the bride in the
Song of Songs, where she says: “Set in order love in me.” <span
id="fr_1986"></span>[1987](#fn_1986.md) For this <span id="page_455">p.
455</span> <span id="iv.v.vii.xiv-Page_455"></span>is true love set in
order, which, while it hates no one, yet loves some still more by reason
of their deserving it, and which, while it loves all in general, singles
out for itself some from those, whom it may embrace with a special
affection, and again among those, who are the special and chief objects
of its love, singles out some who are preferred to others in affection.
