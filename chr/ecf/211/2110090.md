#### <span id="ii.iv.iii.x-p0.1"></span>Chapter X.

<span id="ii.iv.iii.x-p1"></span>“<span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.iii.x-p1.1"></span>Being</span> accustomed to eat fish at the
time of Easter, he enquired a little before the hour for refreshment,
whether it was in readiness. Then Cato, the deacon, to whom the outward
management of the monastery belonged, and who was himself a skillful
fisher, tells him that no capture had fallen to his lot the whole day,
and that other fishers, who used to sell what they caught, had also been
able to do nothing. ‘Go,’ said he, ‘let down your line, and a capture
will follow.’ As Sulpitius there has already described, we had our
dwelling close to the river. We all went, then, as these were holidays,
to see our friend fishing, with the hopes of all on the stretch, that
the efforts would not be in vain by which, under the advice of Martin
himself, it was sought to obtain fish for his use. At the first throw
the deacon drew out, in a very small net, an enormous pike, and ran
joyfully back to the monastery, with the feeling undoubtedly to which
some poet gave utterance (for we use a learned verse, inasmuch as we are
conversing with learned people)—‘And brought his captive boar <span
id="fr_134"></span>[135](#fn_134.md) to wondering Argos.’

<span id="ii.iv.iii.x-p3"></span>“Truly that disciple of Christ,
imitating the miracles performed by the Saviour, and which he, by way of
example, set before the view of his saints, showed Christ also working
in him, who, glorifying his own holy follower everywhere, conferred upon
that one man the gifts of various graces. Arborius, of the imperial
bodyguard, testifies that he saw the hand of Martin as he was offering
sacrifice, clothed, as it seemed, with the noblest gems, while it
glittered with a purple light; and that, when his right hand was moved,
he heard the clash of the gems, as they struck together.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_134"></span>[50:135](2110090.htm#fr_134.md) <span
id="ii.iv.iii.x-p1.2"></span>

<span id="ii.iv.iii.x-p2"></span> “captivum suem.” Probably there is
here an allusion to the capture of the Erymanthian boar by Hercules,
with a punning reference to a secondary meaning of *sus* as a kind of
fish.
