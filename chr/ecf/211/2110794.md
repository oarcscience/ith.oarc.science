#### <span id="iv.iv.x.xxiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXIV.

<span id="iv.iv.x.xxiv-p1"></span>How we ought not to ask for other
things, except only those which are contained in the limits of the
Lord’s Prayer.

<span id="iv.iv.x.xxiv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.x.xxiv-p2.1"></span>You</span> see then what is the method and
form of prayer proposed to us by the Judge Himself, who is to be prayed
to by it, a form in which there is contained no petition for riches, no
thought of honours, no request for power and might, no mention of bodily
health and of temporal life. For He who is the Author of Eternity would
have men ask of Him nothing uncertain, nothing paltry, and nothing
temporal. And so a man will offer the greatest insult to His Majesty and
Bounty, if he leaves on one side these eternal petitions and chooses
rather to ask of Him something transitory and uncertain; and will also
incur the indignation rather than the propitiation of the Judge by the
pettiness of his prayer.
