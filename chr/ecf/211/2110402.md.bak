#### <span id="iv.iii.v.xxix-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXIX.

<span id="iv.iii.v.xxix-p1"></span>Of Abbot Machetes, who never slept
during the spiritual conferences, but always went to sleep during
earthly tales.

<span id="iv.iii.v.xxix-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.v.xxix-p2.1"></span>We</span> knew an old man, Machetes by
name, who lived at a distance from the crowds of the brethren, and
obtained by his daily prayers <span id="page_244">p. 244</span> <span
id="iv.iii.v.xxix-Page_244"></span>this grace from the Lord, that as
often as a spiritual conference was held, whether by day or by night, he
never was at all overcome by sleep: but if any one tried to introduce a
word of detraction, or idle talk, he dropped off to sleep at once as if
the poison of slander could not possibly penetrate to pollute his ears.
