#### <span id="iv.vi.v.xxviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXVIII.

<span id="iv.vi.v.xxviii-p1"></span>Why it is called Quadragesima, when
the fast is only kept for thirty-six days.

<span id="iv.vi.v.xxviii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.v.xxviii-p2.1"></span>But</span> further, as man’s
carelessness dropped out of sight the reason of this, this season when,
as was said, the tithes of the year are offered by fasts for thirty-six
days and a half, was called Quadragesima, <span
id="fr_2208"></span>[2209](#fn_2208.md) a name which perhaps <span
id="page_515">p. 515</span> <span
id="iv.vi.v.xxviii-Page_515"></span>they thought ought to be given to it
for this reason; viz., that it is said that Moses and Elijah and our
Lord Jesus Christ Himself fasted for forty days. To the mystery of which
number are not unsuitably applied those forty years in which Israel
dwelt in the wilderness, and in like manner the forty stations which
they are said to have passed through with a mystic meaning. Or perhaps
the tithe was properly given the name of Quadragesima from the use of
the custom-house. For so that state tax is commonly called, from which
the same proportion of the increment is assigned for the king’s use, as
the legal tribute of Quadragesima, which is required of us by the King
of all the ages for the use of our life. At any rate, although this has
nothing to do with the question raised, yet I think that I ought not to
omit the fact that very often our elders used to testify that especially
on these days the whole body of monks was attacked according to the
ancient custom of the people opposed to them, and was more vehemently
urged to forsake their homes, for this reason, because in accordance
with this figure, whereby the Egyptians formerly oppressed the children
of Israel with grievous afflictions, so now also the spiritual Egyptians
try to bow down the true Israel, i.e., the monastic folk, with hard and
vile tasks, lest by means of that peace which is dear to God, we should
forsake the land of Egypt, and for our good cross to the desert of
virtues, so that Pharaoh rages against us and says: “They are idle and
therefore they cry saying: Let us go and sacrifice to the Lord our God.
Let them be oppressed with labours, and be harassed in their works, and
they shall not be harassed by vain words.” <span
id="fr_2209"></span>[2210](#fn_2209.md) For certainly their folly imagines
that the holy sacrifice of the Lord, which is only offered in the desert
of a pure heart, is the height of folly, for “religion is an abomination
to a sinner.” <span id="fr_2210"></span>[2211](#fn_2210.md)

<span id="iv.vi.v.xxviii-p3"></span> Cassian here gives three
suggestions why the fast of thirty-six days’ duration was called
Quadragesima. (1) As roughly corresponding to the forty days fast of
Moses, Elijah, and the Lord Himself, (2) because “forty” is the number
associated with a time of probation in Scripture, and (3) because of the
analogy of a legal tribute of “Quadragesima” paid to the Sovereign. It
is certainly a curious and difficult question why the name Quadragesima
should have been so universally applied to the fast, when there is no
evidence of its having been kept for forty days till sometime after the
date of Gregory the Great, when Ash Wednesday and the three following
days were prefixed to the six weeks expressly for the purpose of making
the number forty. The *name* however, had as we see from Socrates,
Sozomen, Cassian himself, and many other writers, existed long before
this; and on the whole it appears probable that it originated in none of
the reasons given above by Cassian but that in the first instance it was
connected “with the period during which our Lord yielded to the power of
death, which was estimated at *forty hours*; viz., from noon on Friday
till 4 <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.v.xxviii-p3.1"></span>A.M</span>. on Sunday.” See Dictionary
of Christian Antiquities, Vol. ii. p. 973; and cf. Irenæus Ep. ad
Victor. in Euseb. V. xxiv.; and Tertullian De Orat. c. 18; and De
Jejuniis c. ii. and xiii.
