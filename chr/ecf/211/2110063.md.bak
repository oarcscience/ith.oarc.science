#### <span id="ii.iv.i.xxvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXVI.

<span id="ii.iv.i.xxvi-p1"></span>“<span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.i.xxvi-p1.1"></span>Why</span> do you,” here exclaimed
Postumianus, “speak to me in such a manner? As if I did not hold the
same opinion as yourself, and had not always been of the same mind. I,
indeed, as long as I live, and retain my senses, will ever celebrate the
monks of Egypt: I will praise the anchorites; I will admire the
eremites; but I will place Martin in a position of his own: I do not
venture to compare to him any one of the monks, far less any of the
bishops. Egypt owns this: Syria and Æthiopia have discovered this: India
has heard this; Parthia and Persia have known this; not even Armenia is
ignorant of it; the remote Bosphorus is aware of it; and in a word,
those are acquainted with it who visit the Fortunate Islands or the
Arctic Ocean. All the more wretched on this account is this country of
ours, which has not been found worthy to be acquainted with so great a
man, although he was in its immediate vicinity. However, I will <span
id="page_37">p. 37</span> <span id="ii.iv.i.xxvi-Page_37"></span>not
include the people at large in this censure: only the clerics, only the
priests know nothing of him; and not without reason were they, in their
ill-will, disinclined to know him, inasmuch as, had they become
acquainted with his virtues they must have recognized their own vices. I
shudder to state what I have lately heard, that a miserable man (I know
him not), has said that you have told many lies in that book of yours.
This is not the voice of a man, but of the devil; and it is not Martin
who is, in this way, injured, but faith is taken from the Gospels
themselves. For, since the Lord himself testified of works of the kind
which Martin accomplished, that they were to be performed by all the
faithful, he who does not believe that Martin accomplished such deeds,
simply does not believe that Christ uttered such words. But the
miserable, the degenerate, the somnolent, are put to shame, that the
things which they themselves cannot do, were done by him, and prefer
rather to deny his virtues than to confess their own inertness. But let
us, as we hasten on to other matters, let go all remembrance of such
persons: and do you rather, as I have for a long time desired, proceed
to narrate the still untold deeds of Martin.”

<span id="ii.iv.i.xxvi-p2"></span>“Well,” said I, “I think that your
request would more properly be directed to our friend the Gaul, since he
is acquainted with more of Martin’s doings than I am—for a disciple
could not be ignorant of the deeds of his master—and who certainly owes
a return of kindness, not only to Martin, but to both of us, inasmuch as
I have already published my book, and you have, so far, related to us
the doings of our brethren in the East. Let then, our friend the Gaul
commence that detailed account which is due from him: because, as I have
said, he both owes us a return in the way of speaking, and will, I
believe, do this much for his friend Martin—that he shall, not
unwillingly, give a narrative of his deeds.”
