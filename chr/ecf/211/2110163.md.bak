#### <span id="ii.vi.i.xxix-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXIX.

<span id="ii.vi.i.xxix-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.vi.i.xxix-p1.1"></span>About</span> these times, civil war, as we
have said, had broken out; and the following was the cause of the
tumult. A certain Levite was on a journey along with his concubine, and,
constrained by the approach of night, he took up his abode in the town
of Gabaa, which was inhabited by men of Benjamin. A certain old man
having kindly admitted him to hospitality, the young men of the town
surrounded the guest, with the view of subjecting him to improper
treatment. After being much chidden by the old man, and with difficulty
dissuaded from their purpose, they at length received for their wanton
sport the person of his concubine as a substitute for his own; and they
thus spared the stranger, but abused her through the whole night, and
only restored her on the following day. But she (whether from the injury
their vile conduct had inflicted on her, or from shame, I do not venture
to assert) died on again seeing <span id="fr_294"></span>[295](#fn_294.md)
her husband. Then the Levite, in testimony of the horrible deed, divided
her members into twelve parts, and distributed them among the twelve
tribes that indignation at such conduct might the more readily be
excited in them all. And when this became known to all of them, the
other eleven tribes entered into a warlike confederacy against Benjamin.
In this war, Judah, as we have said, was the general. But they had bad
success in the first two battles. At length, however, in the third, the
Benjamites were conquered, and cut off to a man; thus the crime of a few
was punished by the destruction of a multitude. These things also are
contained in the Book of Judges: the Books of Kings follow. But to me
who am following the succession of the years, and the order of the
dates, the history does not appear marked by strict chronological
accuracy. For, since after Samson as judge, there came Semigar, and a
little later the history certifies that the people lived without judges,
Eli the priest is related in the Books of Kings to have also been a
judge, <span id="fr_295"></span>[296](#fn_295.md) but the Scripture has not
stated how many years there were between Eli and Samson. I see that
there was some portion of time between these two, which is left in
obscurity. But, from the day of the death of Joshua up to the time at
which Samson died, there are reckoned four hundred and eighteen years,
and from the beginning of the world, four thousand three hundred and
three. Nevertheless, I am not ignorant that others differ from this
reckoning of ours; but I am at the same time conscious that I have, not
without some care, set forth the order of events in the successive years
(a thing hitherto left in obscurity), until I have fallen upon these
times, concerning which I confess that I have my doubts. Now I shall go
on to what remains.

<span id="ii.vi.i.xxix-p2"></span> A clear mistake of memory in our
author. The whole narrative is confused.
