#### <span id="iv.vi.ii.xii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XII.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xii-p1"></span>A question how true patience can be
gained.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.xii-p2.1"></span>Germanus</span>: We should like to know
how that calmness can be secured and maintained, that, as when silence
is enjoined on us we shut the door of our mouth, and lay an embargo on
speech, so also we may be able to preserve gentleness of heart, which
sometimes even when the tongue is restrained loses its state of calmness
within: and for this reason we think that the blessing of gentleness can
only be preserved by one in a remote cell and solitary dwelling.
