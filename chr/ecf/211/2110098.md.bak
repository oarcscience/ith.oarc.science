#### <span id="ii.iv.iii.xviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.

<span id="ii.iv.iii.xviii-p1"></span>“<span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.iii.xviii-p1.1"></span>But</span> when you have again set sail
from that place with the view of making for Jerusalem, I enjoin upon you
a duty connected with our grief, that, if you ever come to the shore of
renowned Ptolemais, you enquire most carefully where Pomponius, that
friend of ours, is buried, and that you do not refuse to visit his
remains on that foreign soil. There shed many tears, as much from the
working of your own feelings, as from our tender affection; and although
it is but a worthless gift, scatter the ground there with purple flowers
and sweet-smelling grass. And you will say to him, but not roughly, and
not harshly,—with the address of one who sympathizes, and not with the
tone of one who reproaches,—that if he had only been willing to listen
to you at one time, or to me constantly, and if he had invited Martin
rather than that man whom I am unwilling to name, he would never have
been so cruelly separated from me, or covered by a heap of unknown dust,
having suffered death in the midst of the sea with the lot of a
ship-wrecked pirate, and with difficulty securing burial on a
far-distant shore. Let those behold this as their own work, who, in
seeking to revenge him, have wished to injure me, let them behold their
own glory, and being avenged, let them henceforth cease to make any
attacks upon me.”

<span id="ii.iv.iii.xviii-p2"></span>Having uttered these sad words in a
very mournful voice, and while the tears of all the others were drawn
forth by our laments, we at length departed, certainly with a profound
admiration for Martin, but with no less sorrow from our own
lamentations.
