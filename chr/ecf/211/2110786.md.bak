<span id="iv.iv.x.xvi-p1"></span>Of the kinds of prayer to which we
ought to direct ourselves.

<span id="iv.iv.x.xvi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.x.xvi-p2.1"></span>Yet</span> we ought by advancing in life
and attaining to virtue to aim rather at those kinds of prayer which are
poured forth either from the contemplation of the good things to come or
from fervour of love, or which at least, to speak more humbly and in
accordance with the measure of beginners, arise for the acquirement of
some virtue or the extinction of some fault. For otherwise we shall not
possibly attain to those sublimer kinds of supplication of which we
spoke, unless our mind has been little by little and by degrees raised
through the regular course of those intercessions.
