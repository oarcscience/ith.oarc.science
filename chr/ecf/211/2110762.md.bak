#### <span id="iv.iv.ix.xviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.

<span id="iv.iv.ix.xviii-p1"></span>Of the degrees of wickedness which
exist in hostile spirits, as shown in the case of two philosophers.

<span id="iv.iv.ix.xviii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.ix.xviii-p2.1"></span>But</span> of the difference that there
is between demons we have learnt a great deal by means of those two
philosophers who formerly by acts of magic had oftentimes great
experience both of their laziness and of their courage and savage
wickedness. For these looking down on the blessed Antony as a boor and
rustic, and wanting, if they could not injure him any further, at least
to drive him from his cell by illusions of magic and the devices of
demons, despatched against him most foul spirits, for they were impelled
to this attack upon him by the sting of jealousy because enormous crowds
came daily to him as the servant of God. And when these most savage
demons did not even venture to approach him as he was now signing his
breast and forehead with the sign of the cross, and, now devoting
himself to prayer and supplication, they returned without any result to
those who had directed them; and these again sent against him others
more desperate in wickedness, and when these too had spent their
strength in vain, and returned without having accomplished anything, and
others still more powerful were nevertheless told off against the
victorious soldier of Christ, and could prevail nothing against him, all
these great plots of theirs devised with all the arts of magic were only
useful in proving the great value that there is in the profession of
Christians, so that those fierce and powerful shadows, which they
thought would veil the sun and moon if they were directed towards them,
could not only not injure him, but not even draw him forth from his
monastery for a single instant.
