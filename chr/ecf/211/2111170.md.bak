#### <span id="iv.vii.vii.xix-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIX.

<span id="iv.vii.vii.xix-p1"></span>That the birth of Christ in time
diminished nothing of the glory and power of His Deity.

<span id="iv.vii.vii.xix-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.vii.xix-p2.1"></span>For</span> the fact that He came of the
flesh and in the flesh, has reference to His birth, and involves no
diminution in Him: and He was simply born, not changed for the
worse. <span id="fr_2571"></span>[2572](#fn_2571.md) For though, still
remaining in the form of God, He took upon Him the form of a servant,
yet the weakness of His human constitution had no effect on His nature
as God: but while the power of His Deity remained whole and unimpaired,
all that took place in His human flesh was an advancement of His manhood
and no diminution of His glory. For when God was born in human flesh, He
was not born in human flesh in such a way as not to remain <span
id="page_601">p. 601</span> <span
id="iv.vii.vii.xix-Page_601"></span>Divine in Himself, but so that,
while the Godhead remained as before, God might become man. And so
Martha while she saw with her bodily eyes the man, confessed Him by
spiritual sight to be God, saying, “Yea, Lord, I have believed that Thou
art the Christ the Son of the living God, who art come into the
world.” <span id="fr_2572"></span>[2573](#fn_2572.md) So Peter, owing to
the Holy Spirit’s revelation, while externally he beheld the Son of man,
yet proclaimed Him to be the Son of God, saying, “Thou art the Christ,
the Son of the living God.” <span id="fr_2573"></span>[2574](#fn_2573.md)
So Thomas when he touched the flesh, believed that he had touched God
saying, “My Lord and my God.” <span id="fr_2574"></span>[2575](#fn_2574.md)
For they all confessed but one Christ, so as not to make Him two. Do you
therefore believe Him; and so believe that Jesus Christ the Lord of all,
both only Begotten and first-born, is both Creator of all things and
Preserver of men and that the same Person is first the framer of the
whole world, and afterwards redeemer of mankind? Who still remaining
with the Father and in the Father, Being of one substance with the
Father, did (as the Apostle says), “Take the form of a servant, and
humble Himself even unto death, the death of the Cross:” <span
id="fr_2575"></span>[2576](#fn_2575) and (as the Creed says.md) “was born
of the Virgin Mary, crucified under Pontius Pilate, and was buried. And
the third day He rose again according to the Scriptures; and ascended
into heaven; and shall come again to judge both the quick and the dead.”
This is our faith; this is our salvation: to believe that our God and
Lord Jesus Christ is one and the same before all things and after all
things. For, as it is written, “Jesus Christ is yesterday and today and
the same for ever.” <span id="fr_2576"></span>[2577](#fn_2576.md) For
“yesterday” signifies all time past, wherein, before the beginning, He
was begotten of the Father. “Today” covers the time of this world, in
which He was again born of the Virgin, suffered, and rose again. But by
the expression the same “for ever” is denoted the whole boundless
eternity to come.

[Next: Chapter XX. He shows from what has been said that we do not mean
that God was mortal or of flesh before the worlds, although Christ, who
is God from eternity and was made man in time, is but one
Person.](2111171.md)
