#### <span id="iv.iv.viii.xxii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXII.

<span id="iv.iv.viii.xxii-p1"></span>On the fact that the power to hurt
does not depend upon the will of the devils.

<span id="iv.iv.viii.xxii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.viii.xxii-p2.1"></span>But</span> that they have not the power
of hurting any man is shown in a very clear way by the instance of the
blessed Job, where the enemy did not venture to try him beyond what was
allowed to him by the Divine permission; and it is evidenced by the
confession of the same spirits contained in the records of the gospel,
where they say: “If Thou cast us out, suffer us to go into the herd of
swine.” <span id="fr_1486"></span>[1487](#fn_1486.md) And far more must we
hold that they cannot of their own free will enter into any one of men
who are created in the image of God, if they have not power to enter
into dumb and unclean animals without the permission of God. But no
one—I will not say of the younger men, whom we see living most
steadfastly in this desert, but even of those who are perfect—could live
alone in the desert, surrounded by such swarms of foes of this kind, if
they had unlimited power and freedom to hurt and tempt us: and still
more clearly is this supported by the words of our Lord and Saviour,
which in the lowliness of the manhood He had assumed, He uttered to
Pilate, when He said: “Thou couldest have no power against Me at all,
unless it were given thee from above.” <span
