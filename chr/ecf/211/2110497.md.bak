#### <span id="iv.iii.x.xii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XII.

<span id="iv.iii.x.xii-p1"></span>Of his saying: “If any will not work,
neither shall he eat.”

<span id="iv.iii.x.xii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span

them the advice of a teacher or physician, but proceeds with the
severity of a judicial sentence, and, resuming his apostolic authority,
pronounces sentence on his despisers as if from the judgment seat: with
that power, I mean, which, when writing with threats to the Corinthians,
he declared was given him of the Lord, when he charged those taken in
sin, that they should make haste and amend their lives before his
coming: thus charging them, “I beseech you that I may not be bold when I
am present, against some, with that power which is given to me over
you.” And again: “For if I also should boast somewhat of the power which
the Lord has given me unto edification, and not for your destruction, I
shall not be ashamed.” <span id="fr_975"></span>[976](#fn_975.md) With that
power, I say, he declares, “If a man will not work, neither let him
eat.” Not punishing them with a carnal sword, but with the power of the
Holy Ghost forbidding them the goods of this life, that if by chance,
thinking but little of the punishment of future death, they still should
remain obstinate through love of ease, they may at last, forced by the
requirements of nature and the fear of immediate death, be compelled to
obey his salutary charge.
