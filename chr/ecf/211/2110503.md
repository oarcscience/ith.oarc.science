#### <span id="iv.iii.x.xviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.

<span id="iv.iii.x.xviii-p1"></span>That the Apostle wrought what he
thought would be sufficient for him and for others who were with him.

<span id="iv.iii.x.xviii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.x.xviii-p2.1"></span>Then</span> going to Miletus, and from
thence sending to Ephesus, and summoning to him the elders of the church
of Ephesus, he charged them how they ought to rule the church of God in
his absence, and said: “I have not coveted any man’s silver and gold;
you yourselves know how for such things as were needful for me and them
that are with me these hands have ministered. I have showed you all
things, how that so labouring you ought to support the weak, and to
remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said: It is more blessed to
give than to receive.” <span id="fr_981"></span>[982](#fn_981.md) He left
us a weighty example in his manner of life, as he testifies that he not
only wrought what would supply his own bodily wants alone, but also what
would be sufficient for the needs of those who were with him: those, I
mean, who, being taken up with necessary duties, had no chance of
procuring food for themselves with their own hands. And as he tells the
Thessalonians that he had worked to give them an example that they might
imitate him, so here too he implies something of the same sort when he
says: “I have showed you all things, how that so labouring you ought to
support the weak,” viz., whether in mind or body; i.e., that we should
be diligent in supplying their needs, not from the store of our
abundance, or money laid by, or from another’s generosity and substance,
but rather by securing the necessary sum by our own labour and toil.
