#### <span id="iv.iv.ix.x-p0.1"></span>Chapter X.

<span id="iv.iv.ix.x-p1"></span>The answer about the beginning of the
devil’s fall.

<span id="iv.iv.ix.x-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.ix.x-p2.1"></span>Serenus</span>: The passage in Genesis shows
that that was not the beginning of his fall and <span id="page_379">p.
379</span> <span id="iv.iv.ix.x-Page_379"></span>ruin, as before their
deception it takes the view that he had already been branded with the
ignominy of the name of the serpent, where it says: “But the serpent was
wiser” or as the Hebrew copies express it, “more subtle than all the
beasts of the earth, which the Lord God had made.” <span
id="fr_1534"></span>[1535](#fn_1534.md) You see then that he had fallen
away from his angelic holiness even before he deceived the first man, so
that he not only deserved to be stamped with the ignominy of this title,
but actually excelled all other beasts of the earth in the subterfuges
of wickedness. For Holy Scripture would not have designated a good angel
by such a term, nor would it say of those who were still continuing in
that state of bliss: “But the serpent was wiser than all the beasts of
the earth.” For this title could not possibly be applied I say not to
Gabriel or Michæl, but it would not even be suitable to any good man.
And so the title of serpent and the comparison to beasts most clearly
suggests not the dignity of an angel but the infamy of an apostate.
Finally the occasion of the envy and seduction, which led him to deceive
man, arose from the ground of his previous fall, in that he saw that
man, who had but recently been formed out of the dust of the ground, was
to be called to that glory, from which he remembered that he himself,
while still one of the princes, had fallen. And so that first fall of
his, which was due to pride, and which obtained for him the name of the
serpent, was followed by a second owing to envy: and as this one found
him still in the possession of something upright so that he could enjoy
some interchange of conference and counsel with man, by the Lord’s
sentence he was very properly cast down to the lowest depth, that he
might no longer walk as before erect, and looking up on high, but should
cleave to the ground and creep along, and be brought low upon his belly
and feed upon the earthly food and works of sins, and henceforward
proclaim his secret hostility, and put between himself and man an enmity
that is to our advantage, and a discord that is to our profit, so that
while men are on their guard against him as a dangerous enemy, he can no
longer injure them by a deceptive show of friendship.
