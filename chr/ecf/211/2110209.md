#### <span id="ii.vi.ii.xx-p0.1"></span>Chapter XX.

<span id="ii.vi.ii.xx-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.vi.ii.xx-p1.1"></span>At</span> that time, Matthathias, the son
of John, was high-priest. When he was being forced by the servants of
the king to obey the edict, with marvelous courage he set at naught the
profane enactments, and slew, in the presence of all, a Hebrew who was
publicly performing profane acts. A leader having thus been found,
rebellion at once took place. Matthathias left the town; and as many
flocked to him, he got up the appearance of a regular army. The object
of every man in that host was to defend himself by arms against a
profane government, and rather even to fall in war than to take part in
impious ceremonies. In the meantime, Antiochus was compelling those Jews
who were found in the Greek cities in his dominions to offer sacrifice,
and was visiting with unheard-of torments those who refused. At this
time, there occurred that well-known and remarkable suffering of the
seven brothers and their mother. All of the brothers, when they were
being forced to violate the law of God, and the customs of their
ancestors, preferred rather to die. At last, their mother, too,
accompanied them both in their sufferings and death.
