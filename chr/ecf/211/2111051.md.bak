<span id="iv.vi.vii.xiii"></span>

#### <span id="iv.vi.vii.xiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIII.

<span id="iv.vi.vii.xiii-p1"></span>Of this also: “But I know that in
me, that is in my flesh, dwelleth no good thing.”

<span id="iv.vi.vii.xiii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.vii.xiii-p2.1"></span>Because</span> then the original curse
of God has made us carnal and condemned us to thorns and thistles, and
our father has sold us by that unhappy bargain so that we cannot do the
good that we would, while we are torn away from the recollection of God
Most High and forced to think on what belongs to human weakness, while
burning with the love of purity, we are often even against our will
<span id="page_527">p. 527</span> <span
id="iv.vi.vii.xiii-Page_527"></span>troubled by natural desires, which
we would rather know nothing about; we know that in our flesh there
dwelleth no good thing <span id="fr_2272"></span>[2273](#fn_2272.md) viz.,
the perpetual and lasting peace of this meditation of which we have
spoken; but there is brought about in our case that miserable and
wretched divorce, that when with the mind we want to serve the law of
God, since we never want to remove our gaze from the Divine brightness,
yet surrounded as we are by carnal darkness we are forced by a kind of
law of sin to tear ourselves away from the good which we know, as we
fall away from that lofty height of mind to earthly cares and thoughts,
to which the law of sin, i.e., the sentence of God, which the first
delinquent received, has not without reason condemned us. And hence it
is that the blessed Apostle, though he openly admits that he and all
saints are bound by the constraint of this sin, yet boldly asserts that
none of them will be condemned for this, saying: “There is therefore now
no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus: for the law of the
spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath set me free from the law of sin and
death,” <span id="fr_2273"></span>[2274](#fn_2273.md) i.e., the grace of
Christ day by day frees all his saints from this law of sin and death,
under which they are constantly reluctantly obliged to come, whenever
they pray to the Lord for the forgiveness of their trespasses. You see
then that it was in the person not of sinners but of those who are
really saints and perfect, that the blessed Apostle gave utterance to
this saying: “For I do not the good that I would, but the evil which I
hate, that I do;” and: “I see another law in my members resisting the
law of my mind and bringing me captive to the law of sin which is in my
members.” <span id="fr_2274"></span>[2275](#fn_2274.md)
