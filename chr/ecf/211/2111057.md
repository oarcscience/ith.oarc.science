#### <span id="iv.vi.vii.xix-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIX.

<span id="iv.vi.vii.xix-p1"></span>How even in the hour of prayer it is
almost impossible to avoid sin.

<span id="iv.vi.vii.xix-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.vii.xix-p2.1"></span>Whoever</span> then ascribes sinlessness
to human nature must fight against no idle words but the witness and
proof of his conscience which is on our side, and then only should
maintain that he is without sin, when he finds that he is not torn away
from this highest good: nay rather, whoever considering his own
conscience, to say no more, finds that he has celebrated even one single
service without the distraction of a single word or deed or thought, may
say that he is without sin. Further because we admit that the discursive
lightness of the human mind cannot get rid of these idle and empty
things, we thus consequently confess with truth that we are not without
sin. For with whatever care a man tries to keep his heart, he can never,
owing to the resistance of the nature of the flesh, keep it according to
the desire of his spirit. For however far the human mind may have
advanced and progressed towards a finer purity of contemplation, so much
the more will it see itself to be unclean, as it were in the mirror of
its purity, because while the soul raises itself for a loftier vision
and as it looks forth yearns for greater things than it performs, it is
sure always to despise as inferior and worthless the things in which it
is mixed up. Since a keener sight notices more; and a blameless life
produces greater sorrow when found fault with; and amendment of life,
and earnest striving after goodness multiplies groans and sighs. For no
one can rest content with that stage to which he has advanced, and
however much a man may be purified in mind, so much the more does he see
himself to be foul, and find grounds for humiliation rather than for
pride, and, however swiftly he may climb to greater heights, so much
more does he see above him whither he is tending. Finally that chosen
Apostle “whom Jesus loved,” <span id="fr_2288"></span>[2289](#fn_2288.md)
who lay on His bosom, uttered this saying as if from the heart of the
Lord: <span id="page_531">p. 531</span> <span
id="iv.vi.vii.xix-Page_531"></span>“If we say that we have no sin we
deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us.” <span
id="fr_2289"></span>[2290](#fn_2289.md) And so if when we say that we have
no sin, we have not the truth, that is Christ, in us, what good do we do
except to prove ourselves by this very profession, criminals and wicked
among sinners?
