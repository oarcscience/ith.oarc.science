#### <span id="ii.iv.i.xxvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXVII.

<span id="ii.iv.i.xxvii-p1"></span>“<span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.i.xxvii-p1.1"></span>Well</span>,” said the Gaul, “I, for my
part, though I am unequal to so great a task, feel constrained by those
examples of obedience which have been related above by Postumianus, not
to refuse that duty which you impose upon me. But when I reflect that I,
a man of Gaul, <span id="fr_106"></span>[107](#fn_106) am about to speak
in the presence of natives of Aquitania, I fear lest my somewhat rude
form of speech should offend your too delicate ears. However, you will
listen to me as a foolish sort <span id="fr_107"></span>[108](#fn_107)
of man, who says nothing in an affected or stilted fashion. For if you
have conceded to me that I was a disciple of Martin, grant me this also
that I be allowed, under the shelter of his example, to despise the vain
trappings of speech and ornaments of words.”

<span id="ii.iv.i.xxvii-p4"></span>“Certainly,” replied Postumianus,
“speak either in Celtic, or in Gaulish, if you prefer it, provided only
you speak of Martin. But for my part, I believe, that, even though you
were dumb, words would not be wanting to you, in which you might speak
of Martin with eloquent lips, just as the tongue of Zacharias was loosed
at the naming of John. But as you are, in fact, an orator, <span
id="fr_108"></span>[109](#fn_108) you craftily, like an orator, begin by
begging us to excuse your unskillfulness, because you really excel in
eloquence. But it is not fitting either that a monk should show such
cunning, or that a Gaul should be so artful. But to work rather, and set
forth what you have still got to say, for we have wasted too much time
already in dealing with other matters; and the lengthening shadow of the
declining sun warns us that no long portion of day remains till night be
upon us. Then, after we had all kept silence for a little, the Gaul thus
begins—“I think I must take care in the first place not to repeat those
particulars about the virtues of Martin, which our friend Sulpitius
there has related in his book. For this reason, I shall pass over his
early achievements, when he was a soldier; nor will I touch on those
things which he did as a layman and a monk. At the same time, I shall
relate nothing which I simply heard from others, but only events of
which I myself was an eye-witness.”

<span id="ii.iv.i.xxvii-p2"></span> The word *Gaul* here must be taken
in its more limited sense as denoting only the country of the Celtæ. See
the well-known first sentence of Cæsar’s Gallic War.

been derived from the name of a people in Spain noted for their
stolidity.
