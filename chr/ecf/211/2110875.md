#### <span id="iv.v.v.xv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XV.

<span id="iv.v.v.xv-p1"></span>An objection owing to the fact that many
impure persons have knowledge while saints have not.

<span id="iv.v.v.xv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.v.xv-p2.1"></span>Germanus</span>: This assertion does not seem
to us founded on truth, or based on solid reasoning. For if it is clear
that all who either never receive the faith of Christ at all or who
corrupt it by the wicked sin of heresy, are of unclean hearts, how is it
that many Jews and heretics, and Catholics also who are entangled <span

various sins, have acquired perfect knowledge of the Scriptures and
boast of the greatness of their spiritual learning, and on the other
hand countless swarms of saintly men, whose heart has been purified from
all stain of sin, are content with the piety of simple faith and know
nothing of the mysteries of a deeper knowledge? How then will that
opinion stand, which attributes spiritual knowledge solely to purity of
heart?
