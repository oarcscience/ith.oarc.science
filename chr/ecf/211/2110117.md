#### <span id="ii.v.ii.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.

<span id="ii.v.ii.ix-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.ii.ix-p1.1"></span>There</span> follows the clause “how she may
please God,”—God, I say, not men,—“that she may be holy both in body and
spirit.” He does not say that she may be holy only in a member or in the
body, but that she may be holy in body and spirit. For a member is only
one part of the body, but the body is a union of all the members. When,
therefore, he says that she may be holy in the body, he testifies that
she ought to be sanctified in all her members, because the
sanctification of the other members will not avail, if corruption be
found remaining in one. Also, *she* will not be holy in body (which
consists of all the members), who is defiled by the pollution of even
one of them.  But in order that what I say may be made more obvious and
clear, suppose the case of a woman who is purified by the sanctification
of all her other members, and sins only with her tongue, inasmuch as she
either speaks evil <span id="fr_185"></span>[186](#fn_185) of people or
bears false testimony, will all her other members secure the acquittal
of one, or will all the rest be judged on account of the one? If,
therefore, the sanctification of the other members will not avail, even
when one only is at fault, how much more, if all are corrupted by the
guilt of various sins, will the perfection of one be of no avail?
