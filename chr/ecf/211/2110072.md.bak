#### <span id="ii.iv.ii.vii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.

<span id="ii.iv.ii.vii-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.ii.vii-p1.1"></span>To</span> these sayings Postumianus
replies: “While listening to you, O Gaul, I have for a long time been
admiring the faith of the queen; but to what does that statement of
yours lead, that no woman was ever said to have stood more close to
Martin? For let us consider that that queen not only stood near him, but
even ministered unto him. I really fear lest those persons who freely
mingle among women should to some extent defend themselves by that
example.”

<span id="ii.iv.ii.vii-p2"></span>Then said the Gaul: “Why do you not
notice, as grammarians are wont to teach us, the place, the time, and
the person? For only set before your eyes the picture of one kept in the
palace of the emperor importuned by prayers, constrained by the faith of
the queen, and bound by the necessities of the time, to do his utmost
that he might set free those shut up in prison, might restore those who
had been sent into exile, and might recover goods that had been taken
away,—of how much importance do you think that these things should have
appeared to a bishop, so as to lead him, in order to the accomplishment
of them all, to abate not a little of the rigor of his general scheme of
life? <span id="page_42">p. 42</span> <span
id="ii.iv.ii.vii-Page_42"></span>However, as you think that some will
make a bad use of the example thus furnished them, I shall only say that
those will be truly happy if they do not fall short of the excellence of
the example in question. For let them consider that the facts of the
case are these: once in his life only, and that when in his seventieth
year, was Martin served and waited upon at his meals, *not* by a free
sort of widow, nor by a wanton virgin, but by a queen, who lived under
the authority of a husband, and who was supported in her conduct by the
entreaties of her husband, that she might be allowed so to act. It is
further to be observed that she did not recline with Martin at the
entertainment, nor did she venture even to partake in the feast, but
simply gave her services in waiting upon him. Learn, therefore, the
proper course; let a matron serve thee, and not rule thee; and let her
serve, but not recline along with thee; just as Martha, of whom we read,
waited upon the Lord without being called to partake in the feast: nay,
she who chose rather simply to hear the word was preferred to her that
served. But in the case of Martin, the queen spoken of fulfilled both
parts: she both served like Martha and listened like Mary. If any one,
then, desires to make use of this example, let him keep to it in all
particulars; let the cause be the same, the person the same, the service
the same, and the entertainment the same,—and let the thing occur once
only in one’s whole life.”
