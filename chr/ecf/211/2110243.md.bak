### <span id="iii.ii-p1.2"></span>For the Antiquity and Universality of the Catholic Faith Against the Profane Novelties of All Heresies.

#### <span id="iii.ii-p1.4"></span>Chapter I.

<span id="iii.ii-p2"></span>The Object of the Following Treatise.

<span id="iii.ii-p3"></span>\[1.\] <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.ii-p3.1"></span>I, Peregrinus</span>, <span
id="fr_422"></span>[423](#fn_422.md) who am the least of all the servants
of God, remembering the admonition of Scripture, “Ask thy fathers and
they will tell thee, thine elders and they will declare unto
thee,” <span id="fr_423"></span>[424](#fn_423.md) and again, “Bow down
thine ear to the words of the wise,” <span
id="fr_424"></span>[425](#fn_424.md) and once more, “My son, forget not
these instructions, but let thy heart keep my words:” <span
id="fr_425"></span>[426](#fn_425.md) remembering these admonitions, I say,
I, Peregrinus, am persuaded, that, the Lord helping me, it will be of no
little use and certainly as regards my own feeble powers, it is most
necessary, that I should put down in writing the things which I have
truthfully received from the holy Fathers, since I shall then have ready
at hand wherewith by constant reading to make amends for the weakness of
my memory.

<span id="iii.ii-p8"></span>\[2.\] To this I am incited not only by
regard to the fruit to be expected from my labour but also by the
consideration of time and the opportuneness of place:

<span id="iii.ii-p9"></span>By the consideration of time,—for seeing
that time seizes upon all things human, we also in turn ought to snatch
from it something which may profit us to eternal life, especially since
a certain awful expectation of the approach of the divine judgment
importunately demands increased earnestness in religion, while the
subtle craftiness of new heretics calls for no ordinary care and
attention.

<span id="iii.ii-p10"></span>I am incited also by the opportuneness of
place, in that, avoiding the concourse and crowds of cities, I am
dwelling in the seclusion of a Monastery, situated in a remote
grange, <span id="fr_426"></span>[427](#fn_426.md) where, I can follow
without distraction the Psalmist’s <span
id="fr_427"></span>[428](#fn_427.md) admonition, “Be still, and know that I
am God.”

<span id="iii.ii-p13"></span>Moreover, it suits well with my purpose in
adopting this life; for, whereas I was at one time involved in the
manifold and deplorable tempests of secular warfare, I have now at
length, under Christ’s auspices, cast anchor in the harbour of religion,
a harbour to all always most safe, in order that, having there been
freed from the blasts of vanity and pride, and propitiating God by the
sacrifice of Christian humility, I may be able to escape not only the
shipwrecks of the present life, but also the flames of the world to
come.

<span id="iii.ii-p14"></span>\[3.\] But now, in the Lord’s name, I will
set about the object I have in view; that is to say, to record with the
fidelity of a narrator rather than the presumption of an author, the
things which our forefathers have handed down to us and committed to our
keeping, yet observing this rule in what I write, that I <span
id="page_132">p. 132</span> <span id="iii.ii-Page_132"></span>shall by
no means touch upon everything that might be said, but only upon what is
necessary; nor yet in an ornate and exact style, but in simple and
ordinary language, <span id="fr_428"></span>[429](#fn_428.md) so that the
most part may seem to be intimated, rather than set forth in detail. Let
those cultivate elegance and exactness who are confident of their
ability or are moved by a sense of duty. For me it will be enough to
have provided a <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.ii-p15.2"></span>Commonitory</span> (or Remembrancer) for
myself, such as may aid my memory, or rather, provide against my
forgetfulness: which same Commonitory however, I shall endeavor, the
Lord helping me, to amend and make more complete by little and little,
day by day, by recalling to mind what I have learnt. I mention this at
the outset, that if by chance what I write should slip out of my
possession and come into the hands of holy men, they may forbear to
blame anything therein hastily, when they see that there is a promise
that it will yet be amended and made more complete.

<span id="iii.ii-p1"></span> <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.ii-p1.1"></span>Commonitory</span>. I have retained the original
title in its anglicised form, already familiar to English ears in
connection with the name of Vincentius. Its meaning as he uses it is
indicated sufficiently, in § 3, “An aid to memory.” Technically, it
meant a Paper of Instructions given to a person charged with a
commission, to assist his memory as to its details.

<span id="fn_422"></span>[131:423](2110243.htm#fr_422.md) <span
id="iii.ii-p3.2"></span>

<span id="iii.ii-p4"></span> *Peregrinus*. It does not appear why
Vincentius writes under an assumed name. Vossius, with whom Cardinal
Noris evidently agrees, supposes that his object was to avoid openly
avowing himself the author of a work which covertly attacked St.
Augustine. Vossius, *Histor. Pelag*. p. 246. Ego quidem ad Vossii
sententiam plane accessissem, nisi tot delatæ a sapientissimis
Scriptoribus Commonitorio laudes religionem mihi pene injecissent.—<span
class="sc"><span id="iii.ii-p4.1"></span>Noris</span>, *Histor. Pelag*.
p. 246.

<span id="iii.ii-p11"></span> Noris, from this word, “villula,” a grange
or country house, concludes that Vincentius, at the time of writing,
though a monk, was not a monk of <span id="iii.ii-p11.1"></span>Lérins
for there could be no “villula” there then, Honoratus having found the
island desolate and without inhabitant, when he settled on it but a few
years previously, “vacantem insulam ob nimictatem squaloris, et
inaccessam venenatorum animalium metu.” *Histor. Pelag*. p. 251. Why,
however, may not the “villula” have been built subsequently to
Honoratus’s settlement and indeed, as a part of it? Whether Vincentius
was an inmate of the monastery of <span id="iii.ii-p11.2"></span>Lérins
at the time of writing the Commonitory or not, he was so eventually, and
died there.

<span id="iii.ii-p15"></span> “<span id="iii.ii-p15.1"></span>Il dit
qu’il l’a voulu écrire d’un style facile et commun, sans le vouloir
orner et polir; et je voudrois que les ouvrages qu’on a pris le plus de
peine à polir dans ce siècle (le 4me) et dans le suivant, ressemblassent
à celui-ci.” *Tillemont*, T. xv. p. 144.
