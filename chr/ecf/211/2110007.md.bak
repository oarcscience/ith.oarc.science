#### <span id="ii.ii.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.

<span id="ii.ii.iv-p1"></span>Christ appears to St. Martin.

<span id="ii.ii.iv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.ii.iv-p2.1"></span>Accordingly</span>, at a certain period, when
he had nothing except his arms and his simple military dress, in the
middle of winter, a winter which had shown itself more severe than
ordinary, so that the extreme cold was proving fatal to many, he
happened to meet at the gate of the city of Amiens <span
id="fr_7"></span>[8](#fn_7.md) a poor man destitute of clothing. He was
entreating those that passed by to have compassion upon him, but all
passed the wretched man without notice, when Martin, that man full of
God, recognized that a being to whom others showed no pity, was, in that
respect, left to him. Yet, what should he do? He had nothing except the
cloak in which he was clad, for he had already parted with the rest of
his garments for similar purposes. Taking, therefore, his sword with
which he was girt, he divided his cloak into two equal parts, and gave
one part to the poor man, while he again clothed himself with the
remainder. Upon this, some of the by-standers laughed, because he was
now an unsightly object, and stood out as but partly dressed. Many,
however, who were of sounder understanding, groaned deeply because they
themselves had done nothing similar. They especially felt this, because,
being possessed of more than Martin, they could have clothed the poor
man without reducing themselves to nakedness. In the following night,
when Martin had resigned himself to sleep, he had a vision of Christ
arrayed in that part of his cloak with which he had clothed the poor
man. He contemplated the Lord with the greatest attention, and was told
to own as his the robe which he had given. Ere long, he heard Jesus
saying with a clear voice to the multitude of angels standing
round—“Martin, who is still but a catechumen, clothed <span
id="fr_8"></span>[9](#fn_8.md) me with this robe.” The Lord, truly mindful
of his own words (who had said when on earth—“Inasmuch <span
id="fr_9"></span>[10](#fn_9.md) as ye have done these things to one of the
least of these, ye have done them unto me), declared that he himself had
been clothed in that poor man; and to confirm the testimony he bore to
so good a deed, he condescended to show him himself in that very dress
which the poor man had received. After this vision the sainted man was
not puffed up with human glory, but, acknowledging the goodness of God
in what had been done, and being now of the age of twenty years, he
hastened to receive baptism. He did not, however, all at once, retire
from military service, yielding to the entreaties of his tribune, whom
he admitted to be his familiar tent-companion. <span
id="fr_10"></span>[11](#fn_10.md) For the tribune promised that, after the
period of his office had expired, he too would retire from the world.
Martin, kept back by the expectation of this event, continued, although
but in name, to act the part of a soldier, for nearly two years after he
had received baptism.
