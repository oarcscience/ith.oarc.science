#### <span id="iv.iv.x.xxi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXI.

<span id="iv.iv.x.xxi-p1"></span>Of our supersubstantial or daily bread.

<span id="iv.iv.x.xxi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.x.xxi-p2.1"></span>Next</span>: “Give us this day our bread
which is <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iv.x.xxi-p2.2"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iv.x.xxi-p2.3"></span>πιούσιον</span>,” i.e., “supersubstantial,”
which another Evangelist calls “daily.” <span
id="fr_1613"></span>[1614](#fn_1613) The former indicates the quality of
its nobility and substance, in virtue of which it is above all <span
id="page_395">p. 395</span> <span
id="iv.iv.x.xxi-Page_395"></span>substances and the loftiness of its
grandeur and holiness exceeds all creatures, while the latter intimates
the purpose of its use and value. For where it says “daily” it shows
that without it we cannot live a spiritual life for a single day. Where
it says “today” it shows that it must be received daily and that
yesterday’s supply of it is not enough, but at it must be given to us
today also in like manner. And our daily need of it suggests to us that
we ought at all times to offer up this prayer, because there is no day
on which we have no need to strengthen the heart of our inner man, by
eating and receiving it, although the expression used, “today” may be
taken to apply to his present life, i.e., while we are living in this
world supply us with this bread. For we know that it will be given to
those who deserve it by Thee hereafter, but we ask that Thou wouldest
grant it to us today, because unless it has been vouchsafed to a man to
receive it in this life he will never be partaker of it in that.

<span id="iv.iv.x.xxi-p3"></span> Here Cassian is relying entirely on
Jerome’s revised text of the Latin, which has *supersubstantialis*  in
S. [Matt. vi. 11](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#011)<span
id="iv.iv.x.xxi-p3.1"></span>, as the rendering of <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.iv.x.xxi-p3.2"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.iv.x.xxi-p3.3"></span>πιούσιος</span> but
translates the same word by *quotidianum* in the parallel passage in S.
[Luke xi. 3](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#003)<span
id="iv.iv.x.xxi-p3.4"></span>. It is curious that Cassian should have
been thus misled, with his knowledge of Greek, as well as his
acquaintance with the old Latin version which has *quotidianum* in both
gospels. Cf. Bishop Lightfoot “On a Fresh Revision of the New
Testament,” p. 219.
