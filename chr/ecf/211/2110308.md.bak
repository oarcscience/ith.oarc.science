<span id="iv.iii.ii.xi"></span>

#### <span id="iv.iii.ii.xi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XI.

<span id="iv.iii.ii.xi-p1"></span>Of the system according to which the
Psalms are said among the Egyptians.

<span id="iv.iii.ii.xi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.ii.xi-p2.1"></span>And</span>, therefore, they do not even
attempt to finish the Psalms, which they sing in the service, by an
unbroken and continuous recitation. But they repeat them separately and
bit by bit, divided into two or three sections, according to the number
of verses, with prayers in between. <span
id="fr_699"></span>[700](#fn_699.md) For they do not care about the
quantity of verses, but about the intelligence of the mind; aiming with
all their might at this: “I will sing with the spirit: I will sing also
with the understanding.” <span id="fr_700"></span>[701](#fn_700.md) And so
they consider it better for ten verses to be sung with understanding and
thought <span id="fr_701"></span>[702](#fn_701.md) than for a whole Psalm
to be poured forth with a bewildered mind. And this is sometimes caused
by the hurry of the speaker, when, thinking of the character and number
of the remaining Psalms to be sung, he takes no pains to make the
meaning clear to his hearers, but hastens on to get to the end of the
service. Lastly, if any of the younger monks, either through fervour of
spirit or because he has not yet been properly <span id="page_210">p.
210</span> <span id="iv.iii.ii.xi-Page_210"></span>taught, goes beyond
the proper limit of what is to be sung, the one who is singing the Psalm
is stopped by the senior clapping his hands where he sits in his stall,
and making them all rise for prayer. Thus they take every possible care
that no weariness may creep in among them as they sit through the length
of the Psalms, as thereby not only would the singer himself lose the
fruits of understanding, but also loss would be incurred by those whom
he made to feel the service a weariness by going on so long. They also
observe this with the greatest care; viz., that no Psalm should be said
with the response of Alleluia except those which are marked with the
inscription of Alleluia in their title. <span
id="fr_702"></span>[703](#fn_702.md) But the aforesaid number of twelve
Psalms they divide in such a way that, if there are two brethren they
each sing six; if there are three, then four; and if four, three each. A
smaller number than this they never sing in the congregation, and
accordingly, however large a congregation is assembled, not more than
four brethren sing in the service. <span

<span id="iv.iii.ii.xi-p3"></span> This plan of dividing some of the
longer Psalms (as is still done with the 119th in the English Psalter)
was adopted sometimes in the West also. Cf. the Rule of S. Benedict, c.
xviii., and the Third Council of Narbonne (<span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.ii.xi-p3.1"></span>a.d.</span> 589), Canon 2: “Ut in
psallendis ordinibus per quemque Psalmum *Gloria* dicatur Omnipotenti
Deo, per majores vero Psalmos, prout fuerint prolixius, pausationes
fiant, et per quamque pausationem *Gloria* *Trinitatis* Domino
decantetur.” Further, the rule that prayers should be intermingled with
Psalms which was perhaps introduced into the West by Cassian, was widely
adopted both in Gaul and in Spain.

<span id="iv.iii.ii.xi-p7"></span> This arrangement by which the Psalm
was sung by a single voice, while the rest of the congregation listened,
is that which was afterwards known by the name of *Tractus*.
