#### <span id="iv.iii.x.xv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XV.

<span id="iv.iii.x.xv-p1"></span>How kindness should be shown even to
the idle and careless.

<span id="iv.iii.x.xv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.x.xv-p2.1"></span>Nevertheless</span>, like a far-sighted and
careful physician, he is not only anxious to heal the wounds of the
sick, but gives suitable directions as well to the whole, that their
health may be preserved continually, and says: “But be not ye weary in
well doing:” ye who following us, i.e., our ways, copy the example given
to you by imitating us in work, and do not follow their sloth and
laziness: “Do not be weary in well doing;” i.e., do you likewise show
kindness towards them if by chance they have failed to observe what we
said. As then he was severe with those who were weak, for fear lest
being enervated by laziness they might yield to restlessness and
inquisitiveness, so he admonishes those who are in good health neither
to restrain that kindness <span id="page_272">p. 272</span> <span
id="iv.iii.x.xv-Page_272"></span>which the Lord’s command bids us show
to the good and evil, <span id="fr_978"></span>[979](#fn_978.md) even if
some bad men will not turn to sound doctrine; nor to desist from doing
good and encouraging them both by words of consolation and by rebuke as
well as by ordinary kindness and civility.
