#### <span id="iv.v.vii.xxii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXII.

<span id="iv.v.vii.xxii-p1"></span>The answer that Christ looks not only
at the action but also at the will.

<span id="iv.v.vii.xxii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.vii.xxii-p2.1"></span>Joseph</span>: As was said a little
before, we must look not only at the thing which is done, but also at
the character of the mind and the purpose of the doer. And therefore if
you weigh with a careful scrutiny of heart what is done by each man and
consider with what mind it is done or from what feeling it proceeds, you
will see that the virtue of patience and gentleness cannot possibly be
fulfilled in the opposite spirit, i.e., that of impatience and rage.
Since our Lord and Saviour, when giving us a thorough lesson on the
virtue of patience and gentleness (i.e., teaching us not only to profess
it with our lips, but to store it up in the inmost recesses of the soul)
gave us this summary of evangelical perfection, saying: “If any one
smites thee on thy right cheek, offer him the other also” <span
id="fr_1997"></span>[1998](#fn_1997) (doubtless the “*right*” cheek is
mentioned, as another “right” cheek cannot be found except in the face
of the inner man, so to speak), as by this He desires entirely to remove
all incitement to anger from the deepest recesses of the soul, i.e.,
that if your external right cheek has received a blow from the striker,
the inner man also humbly consenting may offer its right cheek to be
smitten, sympathizing with the suffering of the outward man, and in a
way submitting and subjecting its own body to wrong from the striker,
that the inner man may not even silently be <span id="page_458">p.
458</span> <span id="iv.v.vii.xxii-Page_458"></span>disturbed in itself
at the blows of the outward man. You see then that they are very far
from evangelical perfection, which teaches that patience must be
maintained, not in words but in inward tranquillity of heart, and which
bids us preserve it whatever evil happens, that we may not only keep
ourselves always from disturbing anger, but also by submitting to their
injuries compel those, who are disturbed by their own fault, to become
calm, when they have had their fill of blows; and so overcome their rage
by our gentleness. And so also we shall fulfil these words of the
Apostle: “Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.” <span
id="fr_1998"></span>[1999](#fn_1998) And it is quite clear that this
cannot be fulfilled by those who utter words of gentleness and humility
in such a spirit and rage that they not only fail to lessen the fire of
wrath which has been kindled, but rather make it blaze up the more
fiercely both in their own feelings and in those of their enraged
brother. But these, even if they could in some way keep calm and quiet
themselves, would yet not bear any fruits of righteousness, while they
claim the glory of patience on their part by their neighbour’s loss, and
are thus altogether removed from that Apostolic love which “Seeketh not
her own,” <span id="fr_1999"></span>[2000](#fn_1999) but the things of
others. For it does not so desire riches in such a way as to make profit
for itself out of one’s neighbour’s loss, nor does it wish to gain
anything if it involves the spoiling of another.
