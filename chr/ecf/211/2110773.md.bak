#### <span id="iv.iv.x.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.

<span id="iv.iv.x.iii-p1"></span>How pure and sincere prayer can be
gained.

<span id="iv.iv.x.iii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.x.iii-p2.1"></span>And</span> therefore in order that prayer
may be offered up with that earnestness and purity with which it ought
to be, we must by all means observe these rules. First all anxiety about
carnal things must be entirely got rid of; next we must leave no room
for not merely the care but even the recollection of any business
affairs, and in like manner also must lay aside all backbitings, vain
and incessant chattering, and buffoonery; anger above all and disturbing
moroseness must be entirely destroyed, and the deadly taint of carnal
lust and covetousness be torn up by the roots. And so when these and
such like faults which are also visible to the eyes of men, are entirely
removed and cut off, and when such a purification and cleansing, as we
spoke of, has first taken place, which is brought about by pure
simplicity and innocence, then first there must be laid the secure
foundations of a deep humility, which may be able to support a tower
that shall reach the sky; and next the spiritual structure of the
virtues must be built up upon them, and the soul kept free from all
conversation and from roving thoughts that thus it may by little and
little begin to rise to the contemplation of God and to spiritual
insight. For whatever our mind has been thinking of before the hour of
prayer, is sure to occur to us while we are praying through the activity
of the memory. Wherefore what we want to find ourselves like while we
are praying, that we ought to prepare ourselves to be before the time
for prayer. For the mind in prayer is formed by its previous condition,
and when we are applying ourselves to prayer the images of the same
actions and words and thoughts will dance before our eyes, and make us
either angry, as in our previous condition, or gloomy, or recall our
former lust and business, or make us shake with foolish laughter (which
I am ashamed to speak of) at some silly joke, or smile at some action,
or fly back to our previous conversation. And therefore if we do not
want anything to haunt us while we are praying, we should be careful
before our prayer, to exclude it from the shrine of our heart, that we
may thus fulfill the Apostle’s injunction: “Pray without ceasing;” and:
“In every place lifting up holy hands without wrath or disputing.” <span
id="fr_1585"></span>[1586](#fn_1585.md) For otherwise we shall not be able
to carry out that charge unless our mind, purified from all stains of
sin, and given over to virtue as to its natural good, feed on the
continual contemplation of Almighty God.
