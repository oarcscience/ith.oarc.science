what we bring forward may perhaps appear to some to be doubtful, we
ought to regulate our own view (since it does not interfere with faith
in the Trinity) so that it may be included among those things which are
to be held doubtfully; although they rest not on mere opinions such as
are usually given to guesses and conjectures, but on clear Scripture
proof.
