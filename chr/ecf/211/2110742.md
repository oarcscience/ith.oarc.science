#### <span id="iv.iv.viii.xxxiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXIII.

<span id="iv.iv.viii.xxxiii-p1"></span>A question as to the origin of
such differences in powers of evil in the sky.

<span id="iv.iv.viii.xxxiii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.viii.xxxiii-p2.1"></span>Germanus</span>: We certainly do not
doubt that those orders which the Apostle enumerates refer to them: “For
we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities,
<span id="page_375">p. 375</span> <span
id="iv.iv.viii.xxxiii-Page_375"></span>against powers, against the
world-rulers of this darkness, against spirits of wickedness in heavenly
places:” <span id="fr_1514"></span>[1515](#fn_1514) but we want to know
whence comes such a difference between them, or how such grades of
wickedness exist? Were they created for this, to meet with these orders
of evil, and in some way to serve this wickedness?
