#### <span id="iv.iv.iv.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VIII.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.viii-p1"></span>Of our very own possessions in which
the beauty of the soul is seen or its foulness.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.viii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.iv.viii-p2.1"></span>We</span> ought then to take the utmost
care that our inner man as well may cast off and make <span
id="page_324">p. 324</span> <span
id="iv.iv.iv.viii-Page_324"></span>away with all those possessions of
its sins, which it acquired in its former life: which as they
continually cling to body and soul are our very own, and, unless we
reject them and cut them off while we are still in the flesh, will not
cease to accompany us after death. For as good qualities, or charity
itself which is their source, may be gained in this world, and after the
close of this life make the man who loves it lovely and glorious, so our
faults transmit to that eternal remembrance a mind darkened and stained
with foul colours. For the beauty or ugliness of the soul is the product
of its virtues or its vices, the colour it takes from which either makes
it so glorious, that it may well hear from the prophet “And the king
shall have pleasure in thy beauty,” <span
id="fr_1226"></span>[1227](#fn_1226.md) or so black, and foul, and ugly,
that it must surely acknowledge the stench of its shame, and say “My
wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness,” <span
id="fr_1227"></span>[1228](#fn_1227.md) and the Lord Himself says to it
“Why is not the wound of the daughter of my people closed?” <span
id="fr_1228"></span>[1229](#fn_1228.md) And therefore these are our very
own possessions, which continually remain with the soul, which no king
and no enemy can either give or take away from us. These are our very
own possessions which not even death itself can part from the soul, but
by renouncing which we can attain to perfection, and by clinging to
which we shall suffer the punishment of eternal death.
