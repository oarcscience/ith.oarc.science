#### <span id="iv.vi.vii.xvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVI.

<span id="iv.vi.vii.xvi-p1"></span>What is the body of sin.

<span id="iv.vi.vii.xvi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.vii.xvi-p2.1"></span>This</span> then is that body of death
from which we cannot escape, pent in which those who are perfect, who
have tasted “how gracious the Lord is,” <span
id="fr_2278"></span>[2279](#fn_2278.md) daily feel with the prophet “how
bad for himself and bitter it is for a man to depart from the Lord his
God.” <span id="fr_2279"></span>[2280](#fn_2279.md) This is the body of
death which restrains us from the heavenly vision and drags us back to
earthly things, which causes men while singing Psalms and kneeling in
prayer to have their thoughts filled with human figures, or
conversations, or business, or unnecessary actions. This is the body of
death, owing to which those, who would emulate the sanctity of angels,
and who long to cling continually to God, yet are unable to arrive at
the perfection of this good, because the body of death stands in their
way, but they do the evil that they would not, i.e., they are dragged
down in their minds even to the things which have nothing to do with
their advance and perfection in virtue. Finally that the blessed Apostle
might clearly denote that he said this of saintly and perfect men, and
those like himself, he in a way points with his finger to himself and at
once proceeds: “And so I myself,” i.e., I who say this, lay bare the
secrets of my own not another’s conscience. This mode of speech at any
rate the Apostle is familiarly accustomed to use, whenever he wants to
point specially to himself, as here: “I, Paul, myself beseech you by the
mildness <span id="page_529">p. 529</span> <span
id="iv.vi.vii.xvi-Page_529"></span>and modesty of Christ;” and again:
“except that I myself was not burdensome to you;” and once more: “But be
it so: I myself did not burden you;” and elsewhere: “I, Paul, myself say
unto you: if ye be circumcised Christ shall profit you nothing;” and to
the Romans: “For I could wish that I myself were Anathema from Christ
for my brethren.” <span id="fr_2280"></span>[2281](#fn_2280.md) But it
cannot unreasonably be taken in this way, that “And so I myself” is
expressly said with emphasis, i.e., I whom you know to be an Apostle of
Christ, whom you venerate with the utmost respect, whom you believe to
be of the highest character and perfect, and one in whom Christ speaks,
though with the mind I serve the law of God, yet with the flesh I
confess that I serve the law of sin, i.e., by the occupations of my
human condition am sometimes dragged down from heavenly to earthly
things and the height of my mind is brought down to the level of care
for humble matters. And by this law of sin I find that at every moment I
am so taken captive that although I persist in my immovable longing
around the law of God, yet in no way can I escape the power of this
captivity, unless I always fly to the grace of the Saviour.
