#### <span id="iv.v.viii.xxiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXIV.

<span id="iv.v.viii.xxiv-p1"></span>How Abbot Piamun chose to hide his
abstinence.

<span id="iv.v.viii.xxiv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.viii.xxiv-p2.1"></span>Finally</span> Abbot Piamun <span
id="fr_2046"></span>[2047](#fn_2046.md) after twenty-five years did not
hesitate to receive some grapes and wine offered to him by a certain
brother, and at once preferred, against his rule, to taste what was
brought him rather than to display his abstinence which was a secret
from everybody. For if we would also bear in mind what we remember that
our Elders always did, who used to conceal the marvels of their own good
deeds, and their own acts, which they were obliged to bring forward in
Conference for the instruction of the juniors, under cover of other
persons, what else can we consider them but an open lie? And O that we
too had anything worthy which we could bring forward for stirring up the
faith of the juniors! Certainly we should have no scruples in following
their fictions of that kind. For it is better under the colour of a
figure like that to tell a lie than for the sake of maintaining that
unreasonable truthfulness either hide in ill-advised silence what might
be edifying to the hearers, or run into the display of an objectionable
vanity by telling them truthfully in our own character. And the teacher
of the Gentiles clearly teaches us the same lesson by his teaching, as
he chose to bring forward the great revelations made to him, under the
character of some one else, saying: “I know a man in Christ, whether in
the body or out of the body I cannot tell, God knoweth, caught up even
unto the third heaven: and I know such a man, that he was caught up into
paradise and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for man to
utter.” <span id="fr_2047"></span>[2048](#fn_2047.md)
