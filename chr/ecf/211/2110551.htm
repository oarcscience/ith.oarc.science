 who confessed to a most admirable elder that he was attacked by a terrible sin of the flesh: for he was inflamed with an intolerable lust, with the unnatural desire of suffering rather than of committing a shameful act: then the other like a true spiritual physician, at once saw through the inward cause and origin of this evil. And, sighing deeply, said: &#8220;Never would the Lord have suffered you to be given over to so foul a spirit unless you had blasphemed against Him.&#8221; And he, when this was discovered, at once fell at his feet on the ground, and, struck with the utmost astonishment, as if he saw the secrets of his heart laid bare by God, confessed that he had blasphemed with evil thoughts against the Son of God. Whence it is clear that one who is possessed by the spirit of pride, or who has been guilty of blasphemy against God,&#8212;as one who offers a wrong to Him from whom the gift of purity must be looked for&#8212;is deprived of his uprightness and perfection, and does not deserve the sanctifying grace of chastity.</p>
