#### <span id="iv.vii.iv.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.

<span id="iv.vii.iv.ix-p1"></span>How the Apostle’s preaching was
rejected by Jews and Gentiles because it confessed that the crucified
Christ was God.

<span id="iv.vii.iv.ix-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.iv.ix-p2.1"></span>Tell</span> me then, you heretic, you
enemy of all men, but of yourself above all—to whom the cross of our
Lord Jesus Christ is an offence as with the Jews, and foolishness as
with the Gentiles, you who reject the mysteries of true salvation, with
the stumbling of the former, and are foolish with the stubbornness of
the others, why was the preaching of the Apostle Paul foolishness to the
pagans, and a stumbling-block to the Jews? Surely it would never have
offended men, if he had taught that Christ was, as you maintain He is, a
mere man? For who would think that His birth, passion, cross, and death
were incredible or a difficulty? Or what would there have been novel or
strange about the preaching of Paul, if he had said that a merely human
Christ suffered that which human nature daily endures among men
everywhere? But it was surely this that the foolishness of the Gentiles
could not receive, and the unbelief of the Jews rejected; viz., that the
Apostle declared that Christ whom they, like you, fancied to be a mere
man, was God. This it certainly was which the thoughts of these wicked
men rejected, which the ears of the faithless could not endure; viz.,
that the <span id="page_568">p. 568</span> <span
id="iv.vii.iv.ix-Page_568"></span>birth of God should be proclaimed in
the man Jesus Christ, that the passion of God should be asserted, and
the cross of God proclaimed. This it was which was a difficulty: this
was what was incredible; for that was incredible to the hearing of men,
which had never been heard of as happening to the Divine nature. And so
you are quite secure, with such an announcement and teaching as yours,
that your preaching will never be either foolishness to the Gentiles or
a stumbling-block to the Jews. You will never be crucified with Peter by
Jews and Gentiles, nor stoned with James, nor beheaded with Paul. For
there is nothing in your preaching to offend them. You maintain that a
mere man was born, a mere man suffered. You need not be afraid of their
troubling you with persecution, for you are helping them by your
preaching.
