#### <span id="iv.v.v.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VIII.

<span id="iv.v.v.viii-p1"></span>Of spiritual knowledge.

<span id="iv.v.v.viii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.v.viii-p2.1"></span>But</span> to return to the explanation of
the knowledge from which our discourse took its rise. Thus, as we said
above, *practical* knowledge is distributed among many subjects and
interests, but *theoretical* is divided into two parts, i.e., the
historical interpretation and the spiritual sense. Whence also Solomon
when he had summed up the manifold grace of the Church, added:  “for all
who are with her are clothed with double garments.” <span
id="fr_1871"></span>[1872](#fn_1871.md) But of spiritual knowledge there
are three kinds, tropological, allegorical, anagogical, <span
id="fr_1872"></span>[1873](#fn_1872.md) of which we read as follows in
Proverbs: “But do you describe these things to yourself in three ways
according <span id="page_438">p. 438</span> <span
id="iv.v.v.viii-Page_438"></span>to the largeness of your heart.” <span
id="fr_1873"></span>[1874](#fn_1873.md) And so the history embraces the
knowledge of things past and visible, as it is repeated in this way by
the Apostle: “For it is written that Abraham had two sons, the one by a
bondwoman, the other by a free: but he who was of the bondwoman was born
after the flesh, but he who was of the free was by promise.” But to the
allegory belongs what follows, for what actually happened is said to
have prefigured the form of some mystery: “For these,” says he, “are the
two covenants, the one from Mount Sinai, which gendereth into bondage,
which is Agar.  For Sinai is a mountain in Arabia, which is compared to
Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.” But the
anagogical sense rises from spiritual mysteries even to still more
sublime and sacred secrets of heaven, and is subjoined by the Apostle in
these words: “But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother
of us. For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not, break
forth and cry, thou that travailest not, for many are the children of
the desolate more than of her that hath an husband.” <span
id="fr_1874"></span>[1875](#fn_1874.md) The tropological sense is the moral
explanation which has to do with improvement of life and practical
teaching, as if we were to understand by these two covenants practical
and theoretical instruction, or at any rate as if we were to want to
take Jerusalem or Sion as the soul of man, according to this: “Praise
the Lord, O Jerusalem: praise thy God, O Sion.” <span
id="fr_1875"></span>[1876](#fn_1875.md) And so these four previously
mentioned figures coalesce, if we desire, in one subject, so that one
and the same Jerusalem can be taken in four senses: historically as the
city of the Jews; allegorically as Church of Christ, anagogically as the
heavenly city of God “which is the mother of us all,” tropologically, as
the soul of man, which is frequently subject to praise or blame from the
Lord under this title. Of these four kinds of interpretation the blessed
Apostle speaks as follows: “But now, brethren, if I come to you speaking
with tongues what shall I profit you unless I speak to you either by
revelation or by knowledge or by prophecy or by doctrine?” <span
id="fr_1876"></span>[1877](#fn_1876.md) For “revelation” belongs to
allegory whereby what is concealed under the historical narrative is
revealed in its spiritual sense and interpretation, as for instance if
we tried to expound how “all our fathers were under the cloud and were
all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea,” and how they “all
ate the same spiritual meat and drank the same spiritual drink from the
rock that followed them. But the rock was Christ.” <span
id="fr_1877"></span>[1878](#fn_1877.md) And this explanation where there is
a comparison of the figure of the body and blood of Christ which we
receive daily, contains the allegorical sense. But the knowledge, which
is in the same way mentioned by the Apostle, is tropological, as by it
we can by a careful study see of all things that have to do with
practical discernment whether they are useful and good, as in this case,
when we are told to judge of our own selves “whether it is fitting for a
woman to pray to God with her head uncovered.” <span
id="fr_1878"></span>[1879](#fn_1878.md) And this system, as has been said,
contains the moral meaning. So “prophecy” which the Apostle puts in the
third place, alludes to the anagogical sense by which the words are
applied to things future and invisible, as here: “But we would not have
you ignorant, brethren, concerning those that sleep: that ye be not
sorry as others also who have no hope. For if we believe that Christ
died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God
bring with Him. For this we say to you by the word of God, that we which
are alive at the coming of the Lord shall not prevent those that sleep
in Christ, for the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout,
with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of God; and the dead
in Christ shall rise first.” <span id="fr_1879"></span>[1880](#fn_1879.md)
In which kind of exhortation the figure of anagoge is brought forward.
But “doctrine” unfolds the simple course of historical exposition, under
which is contained no more secret sense, but what is declared by the
very words: as in this passage: “For I delivered unto you first of all
what I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the
Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He rose again on the third
day, and that he was seen of Cephas;” <span
id="fr_1880"></span>[1881](#fn_1880.md) and: “God sent His Son, made of a
woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the
law;” <span id="fr_1881"></span>[1882](#fn_1881.md) or this: “Hear, O
Israel, the Lord the God is one Lord.” <span
id="fr_1882"></span>[1883](#fn_1882.md)

id="iv.v.v.viii-p3.2"></span>

<span id="iv.v.v.viii-p4"></span> The meaning of the four senses of
Scripture here spoken of; viz., the historical, tropological,
allegorical, and anagogical, is well summed up in these lines:

<span id="iv.v.v.viii-p5"></span>Litera, gesta docet; quid credas,
allegoria;

<span id="iv.v.v.viii-p6"></span>Moralis, quid agas; quo tendas
anagogia.

<span id="iv.v.v.viii-p7"></span>Or, as the lines are sometimes given:

<span id="iv.v.v.viii-p8"></span>Litera scripta docet; quod credas,
allegoria;

<span id="iv.v.v.viii-p9"></span>Quod speres, anagoge: quid agas,
tropologia.

<span id="iv.v.v.viii-p10"></span>Both Origen and Jerome had spoken of
the threefold sense of scripture, referring to the LXX. rendering of
[Proverbs xxii. 20](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#020.md)<span
id="iv.v.v.viii-p10.1"></span> (which Cassian quotes below): but in
general the Latin Fathers, and the Schoolmen after them, separated the
third of Origen’s senses; viz., the spiritual, into two, the allegorical
and the anagogical: and so the “fourfold” sense became the established
method of interpretation in the West.
