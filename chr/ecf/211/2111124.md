#### <span id="iv.vii.v.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.

<span id="iv.vii.v.iii-p1"></span>He proves from the Epistle to the
Romans the eternal Divinity of Christ.

<span id="iv.vii.v.iii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.v.iii-p2.1"></span>And</span> so as it is clear from the
above testimony that God sent His own Son, and that He who was ever the
Son of God became the Son of man, let us see whether the same Apostle
gives any other testimony of the same sort elsewhere, that the truth
which is already clear enough in itself, may be rendered still more
clear by the light of a twofold testimony. So then the same Apostle
says: “God sent His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh.” <span
id="fr_2448"></span>[2449](#fn_2448.md) You see that the Apostle certainly
did not use these words by chance or at random, as he repeated what he
had already said once—for indeed there could not be found in him chance
or want of consideration as the fulness of Divine counsel and speech had
taken up its abode in him. What then does he say? “God sent His own Son
in the likeness of sinful flesh.” He says the same thing again and
repeats it, saying, “God sent His own Son.” Oh renowned and excellent
teacher! for knowing that in this is contained the whole mystery <span
id="fr_2449"></span>[2450](#fn_2449.md) of the Catholic faith, in order
that it might be believed that the Lord was born in the flesh and that
the Son of God was sent into this world, again and again he makes the
same proclamation saying, “God sent His own Son.” Nor need we wonder
that he who was specially sent to preach the coming of God, made this
announcement, since even before the law, the giver of the law himself
proclaimed it, saying: “I beseech Thee, O Lord, provide another whom
Thou mayest send,” or as it stands still more clearly in the Hebrew
text: “I beseech Thee, O Lord, send whom Thou wilt send.” <span
id="fr_2450"></span>[2451](#fn_2450.md) It is clear that the holy prophet,
<span id="page_575">p. 575</span> <span
id="iv.vii.v.iii-Page_575"></span>feeling in himself a yearning for the
whole human race, prayed as it were with the voices of all mankind to
God the Father that He would send as speedily as possible Him who was to
be sent by the Father for the redemption and salvation of all men, when
he said, “I beseech Thee, O Lord, send whom Thou wilt send.” “God,” he
therefore says, “sent His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh.” Full
well, when he says that He was sent in the flesh, does he exclude for
Him sin of the flesh: for he says “God sent His own Son in the likeness
of the flesh of sin,” in order that we may know that though the flesh
was truly taken, yet there was no true sin, and that, as far as the body
is concerned, we should understand that there was reality; as far as sin
is concerned, only the likeness of sin. For though all flesh is sinful,
yet He had flesh without sin, and had in Himself the likeness of sinful
flesh, while He was in the flesh but He was free from what was truly
sin, because He was without sin: and therefore he says: “God sent His
own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh.”
