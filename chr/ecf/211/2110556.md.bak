#### <span id="iv.iii.xii.xxv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXV.

<span id="iv.iii.xii.xxv-p1"></span>A description of carnal pride, and
of the evils which it produces in the soul of a monk.

<span id="iv.iii.xii.xxv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.xii.xxv-p2.1"></span>This</span> carnal pride therefore, of
which we spoke, when it has gained an entrance into the heart of a monk,
which is but lukewarm, and has made a bad start in renouncing the world,
does not suffer him to stoop from his former state of worldly
haughtiness to the true humility of Christ, but first of all makes him
disobedient and rough; then it does not let him be gentle and kindly;
nor allows him to be on a level with and like his brethren: nor does it
permit him to be stripped and deprived of his worldly goods, as God and
our Saviour commands: and, though renunciation of the world is nothing
but the mark of mortification and the cross, and cannot begin or rise
from any other foundations, but these; viz., that a man should recognize
that he is not merely spiritually dead to the deeds of this world, but
also should realize daily that he must die in the body—it makes him on
the contrary hope for a long life, and sets before him many lengthy
infirmities, and covers him with shame and confusion. If when stripped
of everything he has begun to be supported by the property of others and
not his own, it persuades him that it is much better for food and
clothing to be provided for him by his own rather than by another’s
means according to that text (which, as was before said, <span

288</span> <span id="iv.iii.xii.xxv-Page_288"></span>who are rendered
dense through such dulness and coldness of heart, cannot possibly
understand), “It is more blessed to give than to receive.” <span
