#### <span id="iv.iii.viii.i-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.

<span id="iv.iii.viii.i-p1"></span>How our fourth conflict is against
the sin of anger, and how many evils this passion produces.

<span id="iv.iii.viii.i-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.viii.i-p2.1"></span>In</span> our fourth combat the deadly
poison of anger has to be utterly rooted out from the inmost comers of
our soul. For as long as this remains in our hearts, and blinds with its
hurtful darkness the eye of the soul, we can neither acquire right
judgment and discretion, nor gain the insight which springs from an
honest gaze, or ripeness of counsel, nor can we be partakers of life, or
retentive of righteousness, or even have the capacity for spiritual and
true light: “for,” says one, “mine eye is disturbed by reason of
anger.” <span id="fr_910"></span>[911](#fn_910.md) Nor can we become
partakers of wisdom, even though we are considered wise by universal
consent, for “anger rests in the bosom of fools.” <span
id="fr_911"></span>[912](#fn_911.md) Nor can we even attain immortal life,
although we are accounted prudent in the opinion of everybody, for
“anger destroys even the prudent.” <span
id="fr_912"></span>[913](#fn_912.md) Nor shall we be able with clear
judgment of heart to secure the controlling power of righteousness, even
though we are reckoned perfect and holy in the estimation of all men,
for “the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.” <span
id="fr_913"></span>[914](#fn_913.md) Nor can we by any possibility acquire
that esteem and honour which is so frequently seen even in worldlings,
even though we are thought noble and honourable through the privileges
of birth, because “an angry man is dishonoured.” <span
id="fr_914"></span>[915](#fn_914.md) Nor again can we secure any ripeness
of counsel, even though we appear to be weighty, and endowed with the
utmost knowledge; because “an angry man acts without counsel.” <span
id="fr_915"></span>[916](#fn_915.md) Nor can we be free from dangerous
disturbances, nor be without sin, even though no sort of disturbances be
brought upon us by others; <span id="page_258">p. 258</span> <span
id="iv.iii.viii.i-Page_258"></span>because “a passionate man engenders
quarrels, but an angry man digs up sins.” <span
id="fr_916"></span>[917](#fn_916.md)

id="iv.iii.viii.i-p9.3"></span>᾽</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iii.viii.i-p9.4"></span>Ανὴρ θυμώδης ἐγείρει νεῖκος, ἀνὴρ δὲ
ὀργιλος ἐξώρυξεν ἁμαρτίαν</span>. The old Latin as given by Sabatier has
“Vir animosus parit zixas: vir autem iracundus effodit peccata.” The
verse is quoted by Gregory the Great in a passage which seems a
reminiscence of Cassian’s words with the reading *effundit* for
*effodit* (Moral V. xxxi.). Jerome’s rendering in the Vulgate is quite
different: “Vir iracundus provocat zixas: et qui ad indignandum facilis
est erit ad peccandum proclivior.”
