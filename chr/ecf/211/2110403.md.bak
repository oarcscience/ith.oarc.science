#### <span id="iv.iii.v.xxx-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXX.

<span id="iv.iii.v.xxx-p1"></span>A saying of the same old man about not
judging any one.

<span id="iv.iii.v.xxx-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.v.xxx-p2.1"></span>The</span> same old man, when he was
teaching us that no one ought to judge another, remarked that there were
three points on which he had charged and rebuked the brethren, viz.:
because some allowed their uvula to be cut off, or kept a cloak in their
cell, or blessed oil and gave it to those dwelling in the world who
asked for it: and he said that he had done all these things himself. For
having contracted some malady of the uvula, I wasted away, said he, for
so long, through its weakness, that at last I was driven by stress of
the pain, and by the persuasion of all the elders, to allow it to be cut
off. And I was forced too by reason of this illness, to keep a cloak.
And I was also compelled to bless oil and give it to those who prayed
for it—a thing which I execrated above everything, since that I thought
that it proceeded from great presumption of heart—when suddenly many who
were living in the world surrounded me, so that I could not possibly
escape them in any other way, had they not extorted from me with no
small violence, and entreaties that I would lay my hand on a vessel
offered by them, and sign it with the sign of the cross: and so
believing that they had secured blessed oil, at last they let me go. And
by these things I plainly discovered that a monk was in the same case
and entangled in the same faults for which he had ventured to judge
others. Each one therefore ought only to judge himself, and to be on the
watch, with care and circumspection in all things not to judge the life
and conduct of others in accordance with the Apostle’s charge, “But
thou, why dost thou judge thy brother? to his own master he standeth or
falleth.” And this: “Judge not, that ye be not judged. For with what
judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged.” <span
id="fr_867"></span>[868](#fn_867.md) For besides the reason of which we
have spoken, it is for this cause also dangerous to judge concerning
others because in those matters in which we are offended—as we do not
know the need or the reason for which they are really acting either
rightly in the sight of God, or at any rate in a pardonable manner—we
are found to have judged them rashly and in this commit no light sin, by
forming an opinion of our brethren different from what we ought.

brethren went to sleep during the spiritual conferences, and woke up
when some idle story was told.](2110404.md)
