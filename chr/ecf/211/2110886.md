#### <span id="iv.v.vi.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.

<span id="iv.v.vi.vi-p1"></span>How the merits of each man should not be
judged by his miracles.

<span id="iv.v.vi.vi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.vi.vi-p2.1"></span>And</span> so these men gave no credit to
themselves for their power of working such wonders, because they
confessed that they were done not by their own merits but by the
compassion of the Lord and with the words of the Apostle they refused
the human hon<span id="page_448">p. 448</span> <span
id="iv.v.vi.vi-Page_448"></span>our offered out of admiration for their
miracles: “Men and brethren, why marvel ye at this, or why look ye on us
as though by our own power or holiness we had caused this man to
walk.” <span id="fr_1950"></span>[1951](#fn_1950.md) Nor did they think
that any one should be renowned for the gifts and marvels of God, but
rather for the fruits of his own good deeds, which are brought about by
the efforts of his mind and the power of his works. For often, as was
said above, men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the truth, both
cast out devils and perform the greatest miracles in the name of the
Lord. Of whom when the Apostles complained and said: “Master, we saw one
casting out devils in Thy name, and we forbade him because he followeth
not with us,” though for the present Christ replied to them “Forbid him
not, for he that is not against you is for you,” <span
id="fr_1951"></span>[1952](#fn_1951.md) still when they say at the end:
“Lord, Lord, have we not in Thy name prophesied, and in Thy name cast
out devils, and in Thy name done many mighty works?” He testifies that
then He will answer: “I never knew you: depart from me, ye workers of
iniquity.” <span id="fr_1952"></span>[1953](#fn_1952.md) And therefore He
actually warns those, to whom He Himself has given this glory of
miracles and mighty works because of their holiness, that they be not
puffed up by them, saying: “Rejoice not because the devils are subject
to you, but rejoice rather because your names are written in
heaven.” <span id="fr_1953"></span>[1954](#fn_1953.md)
