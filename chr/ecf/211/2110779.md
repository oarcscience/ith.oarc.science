#### <span id="iv.iv.x.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.

<span id="iv.iv.x.ix-p1"></span>Of the fourfold nature of prayer.

<span id="iv.iv.x.ix-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.x.ix-p2.1"></span>And</span> therefore, when we have laid this
down with regard to the character of prayer, although not so fully as
the importance of the subject requires, but as fully as the exigencies
of time permit, and at any rate as our slender abilities admit, and our
dulness of heart enables us,—a still greater difficulty now awaits us;
viz., to expound one by one the different kinds of prayer, which the
Apostle divides in a fourfold manner, when he says as follows: “I exhort
therefore first of all that supplications, prayers, intercessions,
thanksgivings be made.” <span id="fr_1592"></span>[1593](#fn_1592.md) And
we cannot possibly doubt that this division was not idly made by the
Apostle. And to begin with we must investigate what is meant by
supplication, by prayer, by intercession, and by thanksgiving. Next we
must inquire whether these four kinds are to be taken in hand by him who
prays all at once, i.e., are they all to be joined together in every
prayer,—or whether they are to be offered up in turns and one by one,
as, for instance, ought at one time supplications, at another prayers,
at another intercessions, and at another thanksgivings to be offered, or
should one man present to God supplications, another prayers, another
intercessions, another thanksgivings, in accordance with that measure of
age, to which each soul is advancing by earnestness of purpose?
