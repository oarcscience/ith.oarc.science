#### <span id="iv.vi.v.xviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.

<span id="iv.vi.v.xviii-p1"></span>How fasting is not always suitable.

<span id="iv.vi.v.xviii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.v.xviii-p2.1"></span>Wherefore</span> as we have premised this
on the conditions of fasting, it seems well to subjoin the authority of
Holy Scripture, by which it will be more clearly proved that fasting
neither can nor should be always observed. In the Gospel when the
Pharisees were fasting together with the disciples of John the Baptist,
as the Apostles, as friends and companions of the heavenly Bridegroom,
were not yet keeping the observance of a fast, the disciples of John
(who thought that they acquired perfect righteousness by their fasts, as
they were followers of that grand preacher of repentance who afforded a
pattern to all the people by his own example, as he not only refused the
differ<span id="page_511">p. 511</span> <span
id="iv.vi.v.xviii-Page_511"></span>ent kinds of food which are supplied
for man’s use, but actually altogether did without eating the bread
which is common to all) complained to the Lord and said: “Why do we and
the Pharisees fast oft but thy disciples fast not?” to whom the Lord in
His reply plainly showed that fasting is not suitable or necessary at
all times, when any festival season or opportunity for love intervenes
and permits an indulgence in food, saying: “Can the children of the
bridegroom mourn while the bridegroom is with them? But the days will
come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them; and then shall
they fast;” <span id="fr_2191"></span>[2192](#fn_2191.md) words which
although they were spoken before the resurrection of His Body, yet
specially point to the season of Eastertide, in which after His
resurrection for forty days He ate with His disciples, and their joy in
His daily Presence did not allow them to fast.
