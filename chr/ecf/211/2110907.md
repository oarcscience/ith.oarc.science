#### <span id="iv.v.vii.xvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVI.

<span id="iv.v.vii.xvi-p1"></span>How it is that, if our brother has any
grudge against us, the gifts of our prayers are rejected by the Lord.

<span id="iv.v.vii.xvi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.vii.xvi-p2.1"></span>So</span> far therefore is our Lord
anxious that we should not disregard the vexation of another that He
does not accept our offerings if our brother has anything against us,
i.e., He does not allow prayers to be offered by us to Him until by
speedy amends we remove from his (our brother’s) mind the vexation which
he whether rightly or wrongly feels. For He does not say: “if thy
brother hath a true ground for complaint against thee leave thy gift at
the altar, and go thy way, first be reconciled to him;” but He says: “if
thou remember that thy brother hath aught against thee,” i.e., if there
be anything however trivial or small, owing to which your brother’s
anger is roused against you, and this comes back to your recollection by
a sudden remembrance, you must know that you ought not to offer the
spiritual gift of your prayers until by kindly amends you have removed
from your brother’s heart the vexation arising from whatever cause. If
then the words of the Gospel bid us make satisfaction to those who are
angry for past and utterly trivial grounds of quarrel, and those which
have arisen from the slightest causes, what will become of us wretches
who with obstinate hypocrisy disregard more recent grounds of offence,
and those of the utmost importance, and due to our own faults; and being
puffed up with the devil’s own pride, as we are ashamed to humble
ourselves, deny that we are the cause of our brother’s vexation and in a
spirit of rebellion disdaining to be subject to the Lord’s commands,
contend that they never ought to be observed and never can be fulfilled?
And so it comes to pass that as we make up our minds that He has
commanded things which are impossible and unsuitable, we become, to use
the Apostle’s expression, “not doers but judges of the law.” <span
