#### <span id="iv.iv.iii.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.ix-p1"></span>A question about the acquirement of
true discretion.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.ix-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.iii.ix-p2.1"></span>To</span> this Germanus: It has been fully
and completely shown both by recent instances and by the decisions of
the ancients how discretion is in some sense the fountain head and the
root of all virtues. We want then to learn how it ought to be gained, or
how we can tell whether it is genuine and from God, or whether it is
spurious and from the devil: so that (to use the figure of that gospel
parable which you discussed on a former occasion, in which we are bidden
to become good money changers <span id="fr_1179"></span>[1180](#fn_1179.md)
) we may be able to see the figure of the true king stamped on the coin
and to detect what is not stamped on coin that is current, and that, as
you said in yesterday’s talk using an ordinary expression, we may reject
it as counterfeit, under the teaching of that skill which you treated of
with sufficient fulness and detail, and showed ought to belong to the
man who is spiritually a good money changer of the gospel. For of what
good will it be to have recognized the value of that virtue and grace if
we do not know how to seek for it and to gain it?
