#### <span id="iv.v.v.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.

<span id="iv.v.v.vi-p1"></span>How the weak are easily moved.

<span id="iv.v.v.vi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.v.vi-p2.1"></span>For</span> those who are not yet settled in
the line which they have taken up are often, when they hear some praised
for different interests and virtues, so excited by the praise of them
that they try forthwith to imitate their method: and in this human
weakness is sure to expend its efforts to no purpose. For it is an
impossibility for one and the same man to excel at once in all those
good deeds which I enumerated above. And if anyone is anxious equally to
affect them all, he is quite sure to come to this; viz., that while he
pursues them all, he will not thoroughly <span id="page_437">p.
437</span> <span id="iv.v.v.vi-Page_437"></span>succeed in any one, and
will lose more than he will gain from this changing and shifting about.
For in many ways men advance towards God, and so each man should
complete that one which he has once fixed upon, never changing the
course of his purpose, so that he may be perfect in whatever line of
life his may be.
