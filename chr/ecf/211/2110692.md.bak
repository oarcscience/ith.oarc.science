#### <span id="iv.iv.vii.i-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.i-p1"></span>Description of the wilderness, and the
question about the death of the saints.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.i-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.vii.i-p2.1"></span>In</span> the district of Palestine near
the village of Tekoa which had the honour of producing the prophet
Amos, <span id="fr_1362"></span>[1363](#fn_1362.md) there is a vast desert
which stretches far and wide as far as Arabia and the dead sea, into
which the streams of Jordan enter and are lost, and where are the ashes
of Sodom. In this district there lived for a long while monks of the
most perfect life and holiness, who were suddenly destroyed by an
incursion of Saracen robbers: <span id="fr_1363"></span>[1364](#fn_1363.md)
whose bodies we knew were seized upon with the greatest veneration <span
id="fr_1364"></span>[1365](#fn_1364.md) both by the Bishops of the
neighbourhood and by the whole populace <span id="page_352">p.
352</span> <span id="iv.iv.vii.i-Page_352"></span>of Arabia, and
deposited among the relics of the martyrs, so that swarms of people from
two towns met, and made terrible war upon each other, and in their
struggle actually came to blows for the possession of the holy spoil,
while they strove among themselves with pious zeal as to which of them
had the better claim to bury them and keep their relics—the one party
boasting of their vicinity to the place of their abode, the other of the
fact that they were near the place of their birth. But we were upset by
this and being disturbed either on our own account or on account of some
of the brethren who were in no small degree scandalized at it, inquired
why men of such illustrious merits and of so great virtues should be
thus slain by robbers, and why the Lord permitted such a crime to be
committed against his servants, so as to give up into the hands of
wicked men those who were the admiration of everybody: and so in our
grief we came to the holy Theodore, a man who excelled in practical
common sense. For he was living in Cellæ, <span
id="fr_1365"></span>[1366](#fn_1365.md) a place that lies between Nitria
and Scete, and is five miles distant from the monasteries of Nitria, and
cut off by eighty intervening miles of desert from the wilderness of
Scete where we were living. And when we had made our complaint to him
about the death of the men mentioned above, and expressed our surprise
at the great patience of God, because He suffered men of such worth to
be killed in this way, so that those who ought to be able by the weight
of their sanctity to deliver others from trials of this kind, could not
save themselves from the hands of wicked men (and asked) why it was that
God allowed so great a crime to be committed against his servants, then
the blessed Theodore replied.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.i-p4"></span> Saraceni (<span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iv.vii.i-p4.1"></span>Σαρακηνοί</span>) a name given by the
classical geographers to a tribe of Arabia Felix, famous for its
predatory propensities. Jerome speaks of the “mons et desertum
Saracenorum quod vocatur Pharan” (Liber de situ et nominibus sub voce
Choreb) and elsewhere describes their predatory habits (Liber Heb. Quæst
in Genesim) “Saracenos vagos…qui universas gentes…incursant.” By the
seventh century the name had become a merely general term equivalent to
Arab, and was accordingly adopted and applied indifferently to all the
followers of Mohammed by the writers of the middle ages (cf. the
Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography, *sub voce*).

<span id="fn_1364"></span>[351:1365](2110692.htm#fr_1364.md) <span
id="iv.iv.vii.i-p4.2"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.vii.i-p5"></span> There is no mention of these martyrs
in the so-called Martyrologium Hieronymianum, but they are commemorated
on May 28, in the Roman Martyrology.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.i-p6"></span> Cellæ, which was, according to the
passage before us, between the deserts of Scete and Nitria, apparently
derived its name from the cells of the monks who congregated there. This
at least is the explanation of the name given by Sozomen (H.E. VI.
xxxi.) who speaks of a region called <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iv.vii.i-p6.1"></span>κελλία</span>, throughout which numerous
little dwellings (<span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iv.vii.i-p6.2"></span>οἰκήματα</span>) are dispersed, whence it
obtains its name. Sozomen also speaks (c. xxix.) of Macarius as priest
of Cellæ, a fact which gives some ground for conjecturing that Cellæ may
be identified with Dair Abu Makâr, one of the four monasteries still
existing in the deserts of Nitria and Scete, probably founded by the
saint whose name it bears (Macarius). See A. J. Butler’s “Coptic
Churches of Egypt,” vol. i. c. vii.
