#### <span id="iv.vii.v.xi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XI.

<span id="iv.vii.v.xi-p1"></span>He returns to the prophecy of Isaiah.

<span id="iv.vii.v.xi-p2"></span>“<span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.v.xi-p2.1"></span>The</span> labour,” says he, “of Egypt, and
the merchandize of Ethiopia, and the Sabæans, men of stature shall come
over to thee.” No one can doubt that in these names of different nations
is signified the coming of the nations who were to believe. But you
cannot deny that the nations have come over to Christ, for since the
name of Christianity has arisen, they have come over to the Lord Jesus
Christ not only in faith but actually in name. For since they are called
what they really are, that which was the work of faith becomes the token
by which they are named. “They shall,” he says, “come over to thee and
shall be thine: they shall walk after thee bound with manacles.” As
there are chains of coercion, so too there are chains of love, as the
Lord says: “I drew them with chains of love.” <span
id="fr_2476"></span>[2477](#fn_2476) For indeed great are these chains,
and chains of ineffable love, for those who are bound with them rejoice
in their fetters. Do you want to know whether this is true? Hear how the
Apostle Paul exults and rejoices in his chains, when he says: “I
therefore a prisoner in the Lord beseech you.” <span
id="fr_2477"></span>[2478](#fn_2477) And again: “I beseech thee, whereas
thou art such an one as Paul the aged, and now a prisoner also of Jesus
Christ.” <span id="fr_2478"></span>[2479](#fn_2478) You see how he
rejoiced in the dignity of his chains, by the example of which he
actually stirred up others. But there can be no doubt that where there
is single-minded love of the Lord, there is also single-minded delight
in chains worn for the Lord’s sake: as it is written: “But the multitude
of the believers was of one heart and one soul.” <span
id="fr_2479"></span>[2480](#fn_2479) “And they shall worship thee,” he
says, “and shall make supplication to thee: for in thee is God, and
there is no God beside thee.” The Apostle clearly explains the prophet’s
words, when he says that “God was in Christ reconciling the world to
Himself.” <span id="fr_2480"></span>[2481](#fn_2480) “In Thee then,” he
says, “is God and there is no God beside thee.” When the prophet says
“In Thee is God,” most admirably does he point not merely to Him who was
visible, but to Him who was in what was visible, distinguishing the
indweller from Him in whom He dwelt, by pointing out the two natures,
not by denying the unity (of Person).
