#### <span id="iv.iii.iv.xx-p0.1"></span>Chapter XX.

<span id="iv.iii.iv.xx-p1"></span>Of the three lentil beans which the
Steward found.

<span id="iv.iii.iv.xx-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.iv.xx-p2.1"></span>During</span> the week of a certain
brother the steward passing by saw lying on the ground three lentil
beans which had slipped out of the hand of the monk on duty for the
week <span id="fr_776"></span>[777](#fn_776.md) as he was hastily preparing
them for cooking, together with the water in which he was washing them;
and immediately he consulted the Abbot on the subject; and by him the
monk was adjudged a pilferer and careless about sacred property, and so
was suspended from prayer. And the offence of his negligence was only
pardoned when he had atoned for it by public penance. For they believe
not only that they themselves are not their own, but also that
everything that they possess is consecrated to the Lord. Wherefore if
anything whatever has once been brought into the monastery they hold
that it ought to be treated with the utmost reverence as an holy thing.
And they attend to and arrange everything with great fidelity, even in
the case of things which are considered unimportant or regarded as
common and paltry, so that if they change their position and put them in
a better place, or if they fill a bottle with water, or give anybody
something to drink out of it, or if they remove a little dust from the
oratory or from their cell they believe with implicit faith that they
will receive a reward from the Lord.
