#### <span id="iv.v.viii.xvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVI.

<span id="iv.v.viii.xvi-p1"></span>The answer that Scripture truth is
not to be altered on account of an offence given to the weak.

<span id="iv.v.viii.xvi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.viii.xvi-p2.1"></span>Joseph</span>: Occasions and
opportunities for destroying themselves cannot possibly be wanting to
those who are on the road to ruin, or rather who are anxious to destroy
themselves; nor are those passages of Scripture to be rejected and
altogether torn out of the volume, by which the perversity of heretics
is encouraged, or the unbelief of the Jews increased, or the pride of
heathen wisdom offended; but surely they are to be piously believed, and
firmly held, and preached according to the rule of truth. And therefore
we should not, because of another’s unbelief, reject the <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.v.viii.xvi-p2.2"></span>οἰκονομίας</span>,
i.e., the “economy” of the prophets and saints which Scripture relates,
lest while we are thinking that we ought to condescend to their
infirmities, we stain ourselves with the sin not only of lying but of
sacrilege. But, as we said, we ought to admit these according to the
letter, and explain how they were rightly done. But for those who are
wrongly disposed, the opening for lies will not be blocked up by this
means, if we are trying either altogether to deny or to explain away by
allegorical interpretations the truth of those things which we are going
to bring forward or have already brought forward. For how will the
authority of these passages injure them if their corrupt will is alone
sufficient to lead them to sin?
