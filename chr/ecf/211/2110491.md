#### <span id="iv.iii.x.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.

<span id="iv.iii.x.vi-p1"></span>How injurious are the effects of
accidie.

<span id="iv.iii.x.vi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span

to overcome any one, it either makes him stay in his cell idle and lazy,
without making any spiritual progress, or it drives him out from thence
and makes him restless and a wanderer, and indolent in the matter of all
kinds of work, and it makes him continually go round, the cells of the
brethren and the monasteries, with an eye to nothing but this; viz.,
where or with what excuse he can presently procure some refreshment. For
the mind of an idler cannot think of anything but food and the belly,
until the society of some man or woman, equally cold and indifferent, is
secured, and it loses itself in their affairs and business, and is thus
little by little ensnared by dangerous occupations, so that, just as if
it were bound up in the coils of a serpent, it can never disentangle
itself again and return to the perfection of its former profession.
