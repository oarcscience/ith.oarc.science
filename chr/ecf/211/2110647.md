#### <span id="iv.iv.v.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.

<span id="iv.iv.v.vi-p1"></span>How it is sometimes to our advantage to
be left by God.

<span id="iv.iv.v.vi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.v.vi-p2.1"></span>But</span> the blessed David recognizes that
sometimes this departure of which we have spoken, and (as it were)
desertion by God may be to some extent to our advantage, so that he was
unwilling to pray, not that he might not be absolutely forsaken by God
in anything (for he was aware that this would have been disadvantageous
both to himself and to human nature in its course towards perfection)
but he rather entreated that it might be in measure and degree, saying
“Forsake me not utterly” <span id="fr_1287"></span>[1288](#fn_1287) as
if to say in other words: I know that thou dost forsake thy saints to
their advantage, in order to prove them, for in no other way could they
be tempted by the devil, unless they were for a little forsaken by Thee.
And therefore I ask not that Thou shouldest never forsake me, for it
would not be well for me not to feel my weakness and say “It is good for
me that Thou hast brought me low” <span
id="fr_1288"></span>[1289](#fn_1288) nor to have no opportunity of
fighting. And this I certainly should not have, if the Divine protection
shielded me incessantly and unbrokenly. For the devil will not dare to
attack me while supported by Thy defence, as he brings both against me
and Thee this objection and complaint, which he ever slanderously brings
against Thy champions, “Does Job serve God for nought? Hast not Thou
made a fence for him and his house and all his substance round
about?” <span id="fr_1289"></span>[1290](#fn_1289) But I rather entreat
that Thou forsake me not utterly—what the Greeks call <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.iv.v.vi-p5.2"></span>ἕ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.iv.v.vi-p5.3"></span>ως σφόδρα</span>, i.e.,
too much. For, first, as it is advantageous to me for Thee to forsake me
a little, that the steadfastness of my love may be tried, so it is
dangerous if Thou suffer me to be forsaken excessively in proportion to
my faults and what I deserve, since no power of man, if in temptation it
is forsaken for too long a time by Thine aid, can endure by its own
steadfastness, and not forthwith give in to the power of the enemy’s
side, unless Thou Thyself, as Thou knowest the strength of man, and
moderatest his struggles, “Suffer us not to be tempted above that we are
able, but makest with the temptation a way of escape that we may be able
to bear it.” <span id="fr_1290"></span>[1291](#fn_1290) And something of
this sort we read in the book of Judges was mystically designed in the
matter of the extermination of the spiritual nations which were opposed
to Israel: “These are the nations, which the Lord left that by them He
might instruct Israel, that they might learn to fight with their
enemies,” and again shortly after: “And the Lord left them that He might
try Israel by them, whether they would hear the commandments of the
Lord, which He had commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses, or
not.” <span id="fr_1291"></span>[1292](#fn_1291) And this conflict God
reserved for Israel, not from envy of their peace, or from a wish to
hurt them, but because He knew that it would be good for them that while
they were always oppressed by the attacks of those nations they might
not cease to feel themselves in need of the aid of the Lord, and for
this reason might ever continue to meditate on Him and invoke His aid,
and not grow careless through lazy ease, and lose the habit of
resisting, and the practice of virtue. For again and again, men whom
adversity could not overcome, have been cast down by freedom from care
and by prosperity.
