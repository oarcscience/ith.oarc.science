#### <span id="iv.iv.ix.xx-p0.1"></span>Chapter XX.

<span id="iv.iv.ix.xx-p1"></span>A question about the fallen angels who
are said in Genesis to have had intercourse with the daughters of men.

<span id="iv.iv.ix.xx-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.ix.xx-p2.1"></span>Germanus</span>: Since a passage of Genesis
was a little while ago by the providence of God brought forward in our
midst, and happily reminded us that we can now conveniently ask about a
point which we have always longed to learn, we want to know what view we
ought to take about those fallen angels who are said to have had
intercourse with the daughters of men, and whether such a thing can
literally <span id="page_383">p. 383</span> <span
id="iv.iv.ix.xx-Page_383"></span>take place with a spiritual nature. And
also with regard to this passage of the gospel which you quoted of the
devil a little while back, “for he is a liar and his father,” <span
id="fr_1549"></span>[1550](#fn_1549.md) we should like in the same way to
hear who is to be understood by “his father.”

We find from Augustin (Tract. xxiv. in Johan.) that the Manichees
interpreted this text as implying that the devil had a father,
translating it “For he is a liar, and so is his father.” Augustine
himself explains it as Abbot Serenus does below in c. xxv.; viz., that
the devil is not only a liar himself but the parent of lies.
