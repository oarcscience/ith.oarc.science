#### <span id="ii.vi.i.xviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.

<span id="ii.vi.i.xviii-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.vi.i.xviii-p1.1"></span>These</span> things being said by God,
while the trumpets uttered their voices, the lamps blazed, and smoke
covered the mountain, the people trembled from terror; and begged of
Moses that God should speak to him alone, and that he would report to
the people what he thus heard. Now, the commandments of God to Moses
were as follows: A Hebrew servant purchased with money shall serve six
years, and after that he shall be free; but his ear shall be bored,
should he willingly remain in slavery. Whosoever slays a man shall be
put to death; <span id="page_79">p. 79</span> <span
id="ii.vi.i.xviii-Page_79"></span>he who does so unwittingly shall in
due form be banished. Whosoever shall beat his father or his mother, and
utter evil sayings against them, shall suffer death. If any one sell a
Hebrew who has been stolen, he shall be put to death. If any one strike
his own man-servant or maidservant, and he or she die of the blow, he
shall be put on his trial for doing so. If any one cause a woman <span
id="fr_281"></span>[282](#fn_281.md) to miscarry, he shall be put to death.
If any one knock out the eye or the tooth of his servant, that servant
shall receive his liberty in due form. If a bull kill a man, it shall be
stoned; and if its master, knowing the vicious temper of the animal, did
not take precautions in connection with it, he also shall be stoned, or
shall redeem himself by a price as large as the accuser shall demand. If
a bull kill a servant, money to the amount of thirty double-drachmas
shall be paid to his master. If any one does not cover up a pit which
has been dug, and an animal fall into that pit, he shall pay the price
of the animal to its master. If a bull kill the bull of another man, the
animal shall be sold, and the two masters shall share the price; they
shall also divide the animal that has been killed. But if a master,
knowing the vicious temper of the bull, did not take precautions in
connection with it, he shall give up the bull. If any one steals a calf,
he shall restore five; if he steals a sheep, the penalty shall be
fourfold; and if the animals be found alive in the hands of him who
drove them off, he shall restore double. It shall be lawful to kill a
thief by night, but not one by day. If the cattle of any one has eaten
up the corn of another, the master of the cattle shall restore what has
been destroyed. If a deposit disappears, he, in whose hands it was
deposited, shall swear that he has not been guilty of any deceit. A
thief who is caught shall pay double. An animal given in trust, if
devoured by a wild beast, shall not be made good. If any one defile a
virgin not yet betrothed, he shall bestow a dowry on the girl, and thus
take her to wife; but, if the father of the girl shall refuse to give
her in marriage, then the ravisher shall give her a dowry. If any one
shall join himself to a beast, he shall be put to death. Let him who
sacrifices to idols perish. The widow and orphan are not to be
oppressed; the poor debtor is not to be hardly treated, nor is usury to
be demanded: the garment of the poor is not to be taken as a pledge. A
ruler of the people is not to be evil spoken of. All the first-born are
to be offered to God. Flesh taken from a wild beast is not to be eaten.
Agreements to bear false witness, or for any evil purpose, are not to be
made. Thou shalt not pass by any animal of thine enemy which has
strayed, but shalt bring it back. If you find an animal of your enemy
fallen down under a burden, it will be your duty to raise it up. Thou
shalt not slay the innocent and the righteous. Thou shalt not justify
the wicked for rewards. Gifts are not to be accepted. A stranger is to
be kindly treated. Work is to be done on six days: rest is to be taken
on the Sabbath. The crops of the seventh year are not to be reaped, but
are to be left for the poor and needy.
