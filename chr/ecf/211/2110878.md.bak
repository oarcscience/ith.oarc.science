learning is unfruitful.

<span id="iv.v.v.xviii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.v.xviii-p2.1"></span>But</span> it is certain that for two
reasons the teaching of spiritual things is ineffectual. For either the
teacher is commending what he has no experience of, and is trying with
empty-sounding words to instruct his hearer, or else the hearer is a bad
man and full of faults and cannot receive in his hard heart the holy and
saving doctrine of the spiritual man; and of these it is said by the
prophet: “For the heart of this people is blinded, and their ears are
dull of hearing and their eyes have they closed: lest at any time they
should see with their eyes and hear with their ears, and understand with
their heart and be converted and I should heal them.” <span
