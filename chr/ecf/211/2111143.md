#### <span id="iv.vii.vi.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VIII.

<span id="iv.vii.vi.viii-p1"></span>He confirms the judgment of the
Apostle by the authority of the Lord.

<span id="iv.vii.vi.viii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.vi.viii-p2.1"></span>And</span> though this is the saying of
an Apostle, yet it is the very doctrine of the Lord. For the same Person
says this to Christians by His Apostle, who had Himself said something
very like it to Jews in the gospel, when He said: “But now ye seek to
kill me, a man, who have spoken the truth to you, which I heard of God:
for I am not come of Myself, but He sent me.” <span
id="fr_2516"></span>[2517](#fn_2516) He clearly shows that He is both
God and man: man, in that He says that He is a man: God, in that He
affirms that He was sent. For He must have been with Him from whom He
came: and He came from Him, from whom He said that He was sent. Whence
it comes that when the Jews said to Him, “Thou art not yet fifty years
old and hast Thou seen Abraham?” He replied in words that exactly suit
His eternity and glory, saying, “Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before
Abraham came into being, I am.” <span
id="fr_2517"></span>[2518](#fn_2517) I ask then, whose saying do you
think this is? Certainly it is Christ’s without any doubt. And how could
He who had been but recently born, say that He was before Abraham?
Simply owing to the Word of God, with which He was entirely united, so
that all might understand the closeness of the union of Christ and God:
since whatever God said in Christ, that in its fulness the unity of the
Divinity claimed for Himself. But conscious of His own eternity, He
rightly then when in the body, replied to the Jews, with the very words
which He had formerly spoken to Moses in the Spirit. For here He says,
“Before Abraham came into being, I am.” But to Moses He says, “I am that
I am.” <span id="fr_2518"></span>[2519](#fn_2518) He certainly announced
the eternity of His Divine nature with marvellous grandeur of language,
for nothing can be spoken so worthily of God, as that He should be said
ever to be. For “to be” admits of no beginning in the past or end in the
future. And so this is very clearly spoken of the nature of the eternal
God, as it exactly describes His eternity. And this the Lord Jesus
Christ Himself, when He was speaking of Abraham, showed by the
difference of terms used, saying, “Before Abraham came into being I am.”
Of Abraham he said, “Before he came into being:” Of Himself, “I am,” for
it belongs to things temporal to come into being: to *be* belongs to
eternity. And so “to come into being” He assigns to human
transitoriness: but “to be” to His own nature. And all this was found in
Christ who, by virtue of the mystery of the manhood and Divinity joined
together in Him who ever “was,” could say that He already “was.”

[Next: Chapter IX. Since those marvellous works which from the days of
Moses were shown to the children of Israel are attributed to Christ, it
follows that He must have existed long before His birth in
time.](2111144)
