#### <span id="ii.ii.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.

<span id="ii.ii.viii-p1"></span>Martin restores a Catechumen to Life.

<span id="ii.ii.viii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.ii.viii-p2.1"></span>As</span> Hilarius had already gone away, so
Martin followed in his footsteps; and having been most joyously welcomed
by him, he established for himself a monastery not far from the town. At
this time a certain catechumen joined him, being desirous of becoming
instructed in the doctrines <span id="fr_16"></span>[17](#fn_16.md) and
habits of the most holy man. But, after the lapse only of a few days,
the catechumen, seized with a languor, began to suffer from a violent
fever. It so happened that Martin had then left home, and having
remained away three days, he found on his return that life had departed
from the catechumen; and so suddenly had death occurred, that he had
left this world without receiving baptism. The body being laid out in
public was being honored by the last sad offices on the part of the
mourning brethren, when Martin hurries up to them with tears and
lamentations. But then laying hold, as it were, of the Holy Spirit, with
the whole powers of his mind, he orders the others to quit the cell in
which the body was lying; and bolting the door, he stretches himself at
full length on the dead limbs of the departed brother. Having given
himself for some time to earnest prayer, and perceiving by means of the
Spirit of God that power was present, <span
id="fr_17"></span>[18](#fn_17.md) he then rose up for a little, and gazing
on the countenance of the deceased, he waited without misgiving for the
result of his prayer and of the mercy of the Lord. And scarcely had the
space of two hours elapsed, when he saw the dead man begin to move a
little in all his members, and to tremble with his eyes opened for the
practice of sight. Then indeed, turning to the Lord with a loud voice
and giving thanks, he filled the cell with his ejaculations. Hearing the
noise, those who had been standing at the door immediately rush inside.
And truly a marvelous spectacle met them, for they beheld the man alive
whom they had formerly left dead. Thus being restored to life, and
having immediately obtained baptism, he lived for many years afterwards;
and he was the first who offered himself to us both as a subject that
had experienced the virtues <span id="fr_18"></span>[19](#fn_18.md) of
Martin, and as a witness to their existence.  The same man was wont to
relate that, when he left the body, he was brought before the tribunal
of the Judge, and being assigned to gloomy regions and vulgar crowds, he
<span id="page_8">p. 8</span> <span
id="ii.ii.viii-Page_8"></span>received a severe <span
id="fr_19"></span>[20](#fn_19.md) sentence. Then, however, he added, it was
suggested by two angels of the Judge that he was the man for whom Martin
was praying; and that, on this account, he was ordered to be led back by
the same angels, and given up to Martin, and restored to his former
life. From this time forward, the name of the sainted man became
illustrious, so that, as being reckoned holy by all, he was also deemed
powerful and truly apostolical.

consequences were supposed to flow from dying without receiving baptism.
