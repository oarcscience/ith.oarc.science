<span id="iv.iv.viii.xxxi"></span>

#### <span id="iv.iv.viii.xxxi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXI.

<span id="iv.iv.viii.xxxi-p1"></span>On the fact that those men are more
to be pitied to whom it is not given to be subjected to those temporal
temptations.

<span id="iv.iv.viii.xxxi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.viii.xxxi-p2.1"></span>But</span> we ought to consider those
men truly wretched and miserable in whose case, although they defile
themselves with all kinds of sins and wickedness, yet not only is there
no visible sign of the devil’s possession shown in them, nor is any
temptation proportionate to their actions, nor any scourge of punishment
brought to bear upon them. For they are vouchsafed no swift and
immediate remedy in this world, whose “hardness and impenitent heart,”
being too much for punishment in this life, “heapeth up for itself wrath
and indignation in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous
judgment of God,” “where their worm dieth not, and their fire is not
quenched.” <span id="fr_1502"></span>[1503](#fn_1502) Against whom the
prophet as if perplexed at the affliction of the saints, when he sees
them subject to various losses and temptations, and on the other hand
sees sinners not only passing through the course of this world without
any scourge of humiliation, but even rejoicing in great riches, and the
utmost prosperity in everything, inflamed with uncontrollable
indignation and fervour of spirit, exclaims: “But as for me, my feet had
almost gone, my treadings had well nigh slipped. For I was grieved at
the wicked, when I saw the peace of sinners. For there is no regard to
their death, nor is there strength in their stripes. They are not in the
labour of men, neither shall they be scourged like other men,” <span
id="fr_1503"></span>[1504](#fn_1503) since hereafter they shall be
punished with the devils, to whom in this world it was not vouchsafed to
be scourged in the lot and discipline of sons, together with men.
Jeremiah also, when conversing with God on this prosperity of sinners,
although he never professes to doubt about the justice of God, as he
says “for Thou art just, O Lord, if I dispute with Thee,” yet in his
inquiry as to the reasons of this inequality, proceeds to say: “But yet
I will speak what is just to Thee. Why doth the way of the wicked
prosper? Why is it well with all them that transgress and do wickedly?
Thou hast planted them and they have taken root: they prosper and bring
forth fruit. Thou art near in their mouth and far from their
reins.” <span id="fr_1504"></span>[1505](#fn_1504) And when the Lord
mourns for their destruction by the prophet, and anxiously directs
doctors and physicians to heal them, and in a manner urges them on to a
similar lamentation and says: “Babylon is suddenly fallen: she is
destroyed. Howl for her: take balm for her pain, if so she may be
healed;” then, in their despair, the angels, to whom is entrusted the
care of man’s salvation, make reply; or at any rate the prophet in the
person of the Apostles and spiritual men and doctors who see the
hardness of their soul, and their impenitent heart: “We have healed
Babylon: but she is not cured. Let us forsake her, and let us go every
man to his own land because her judgment hath reached even to <span
id="page_374">p. 374</span> <span
id="iv.iv.viii.xxxi-Page_374"></span>the heavens, and is lifted up to
the clouds.” <span id="fr_1505"></span>[1506](#fn_1505) Of their
desperate feebleness then Isaiah speaks in the Person of God to
Jerusalem: From the sole of the foot unto the top of the head there is
no soundness therein: wounds and bruises and swelling sores: they are
not bound up nor dressed nor fermented with oil.” <span
id="fr_1506"></span>[1507](#fn_1506)
