#### <span id="iv.v.iv.xii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XII.

<span id="iv.v.iv.xii-p1"></span>That a good will should not always be
attributed to grace, nor always to man himself.

<span id="iv.v.iv.xii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.iv.xii-p2.1"></span>For</span> we should not hold that God made
man such that he can never will or be capable of what is good: or else
He has not granted him a free will, if He has suffered him only to will
or be capable of evil, but neither to will or be capable of what is good
of himself. And, in this case how will that first statement of the Lord
made about men after the fall stand: “Behold, Adam is become as one of
us, knowing good and evil?” <span id="fr_1803"></span>[1804](#fn_1803)
For we cannot think that before, he was such as to be altogether
ignorant of good. Otherwise we should have to admit that he was formed
like some irrational and insensate beast: which is sufficiently absurd
and altogether alien from the Catholic faith. Moreover as the wisest
Solomon says: “God made man upright,” i.e., always to enjoy the
knowledge of good only, “But they have sought out many
imaginations,” <span id="fr_1804"></span>[1805](#fn_1804) for they came,
as has been said, to know good and evil. Adam therefore after the fall
conceived a knowledge of evil which he had not previously, but did not
lose the knowledge of good which he had before. Finally the Apostle’s
words very clearly show that mankind did not lose after the fall of Adam
the knowledge of good: as he says: “For when the Gentiles, which have
not the law, do by nature the things of the law, these, though they have
not the law, are a law to themselves, as they show the work of the law
written in their hearts, their conscience bearing witness to these, and
their thoughts within them either accusing or else excusing them, in the
day in which God shall judge the secrets of men.” <span
id="fr_1805"></span>[1806](#fn_1805) And with the same meaning the Lord
rebukes by the prophet the unnatural but freely chosen blindness of the
Jews, which they by their obstinacy brought upon themselves, saying:
“Hear ye deaf, and ye blind, behold that you may see. <span
id="page_429">p. 429</span> <span id="iv.v.iv.xii-Page_429"></span>Who
is deaf but My servant? and blind, but he to whom I have sent My
messengers?” <span id="fr_1806"></span>[1807](#fn_1806) And that no one
might ascribe this blindness of theirs to nature instead of to their own
will, elsewhere He says: “Bring forth the people that are blind and have
eyes: that are deaf and have ears;” and again: “having eyes, but ye see
not; and ears, but ye hear not.” <span
id="fr_1807"></span>[1808](#fn_1807) The Lord also says in the gospel:
“Because seeing they see not, and hearing they hear not neither do they
understand.” <span id="fr_1808"></span>[1809](#fn_1808) And in them is
fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says: “Hearing ye shall hear and
shall not understand: and seeing ye shall see and shall not see. For the
heart of this people is waxed fat, and their ears are dull of hearing:
and they have closed their eyes, lest they should see with their eyes
and hear with their ears and understand with their heart, and be turned
and I should heal them.” <span id="fr_1809"></span>[1810](#fn_1809)
Finally in order to denote that the possibility of good was in them, in
chiding the Pharisees, He says: “But why of your own selves do ye not
judge what is right?” <span id="fr_1810"></span>[1811](#fn_1810) And
this he certainly would not have said to them, unless He knew that by
their natural judgment they could discern what was fair. Wherefore we
must take care not to refer all the merits of the saints to the Lord in
such a way as to ascribe nothing but what is evil and perverse to human
nature: in doing which we are confuted by the evidence of the most wise
Solomon, or rather of the Lord Himself, Whose words these are; for when
the building of the Temple was finished and he was praying, he spoke as
follows: “And David my father would have built a house to the name of
the Lord God of Israel: and the Lord said to David my father: Whereas
thou hast thought in thine heart to build a house to My name, thou hast
well done in having this same thing in thy mind. Nevertheless thou shalt
not build a house to My name.” <span
id="fr_1811"></span>[1812](#fn_1811) This thought then and this purpose
of king David, are we to call it good and from God or bad and from man?
For if that thought was good and from God, why did He by whom it was
inspired refuse that it should be carried into effect? But if it is bad
and from man, why is it praised by the Lord? It remains then that we
must take it as good and from man. And in the same way we can take our
own thoughts today. For it was not given only to David to think what is
good of himself, nor is it denied to us naturally to think or imagine
anything that is good. It cannot then be doubted that there are by
nature some seeds of goodness in every soul implanted by the kindness of
the Creator: but unless these are quickened by the assistance of God,
they will not be able to attain to an increase of perfection, for, as
the blessed Apostle says: “Neither is he that planteth anything nor he
that watereth, but God that giveth the increase.” <span
id="fr_1812"></span>[1813](#fn_1812) But that freedom of the will is to
some degree in a man’s own power is very clearly taught in the book
termed the Pastor, <span id="fr_1813"></span>[1814](#fn_1813) where two
angels are said to be attached to each one of us, i.e., a good and a bad
one, while it lies at a man’s own option to choose which to follow. And
therefore the will always remains free in man, and can either neglect or
delight in the grace of God. For the Apostle would not have commanded
saying: “Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling,” had he
not known that it could be advanced or neglected by us. But that men
might not fancy that they had no need of Divine aid for the work of
Salvation, he subjoins: “For it is God that worketh in you both to will
and to do, of His good pleasure.” <span
id="fr_1814"></span>[1815](#fn_1814) And therefore he warns Timothy and
says: “Neglect not the grace of God which is in thee;” and again: “For
which cause I exhort thee to stir up the grace of God which is in
thee.” <span id="fr_1815"></span>[1816](#fn_1815) Hence also in writing
to the Corinthians he exhorts and warns them not through their
unfruitful works to show themselves unworthy of the grace of God,
saying: “And we helping, exhort you that ye receive not the grace of God
in vain:” <span id="fr_1816"></span>[1817](#fn_1816) for the reception
of saving grace was of no profit to Simon doubtless because he had
received it in vain; for he would not obey the command of the blessed
Peter who said: “Repent of thine iniquity, and pray God if haply the
thoughts of thine heart may be forgiven thee; for I perceive that thou
art in the gall of bitterness and the bonds of iniquity.” <span
id="fr_1817"></span>[1818](#fn_1817) It prevents therefore the will of
man, for it is said:  “My God will prevent me with His mercy;” <span
id="fr_1818"></span>[1819](#fn_1818) and again when God waits and for
our good delays, that He may put our desires to the test, our will
precedes, for it is said: “And in the morning my prayer shall prevent
Thee;” and again: “I prevented the dawning of the day and cried;” and:
“Mine eyes have prevented the morning.” <span
id="fr_1819"></span>[1820](#fn_1819) For He calls and invites us, when
He says: “All the day long I stretched forth My hands to a disobedient
and gainsaying people;” <span id="fr_1820"></span>[1821](#fn_1820) and
He is invited by us when we say to Him: “All the day long I have
stretched forth My hands unto Thee.” <span
id="fr_1821"></span>[1822](#fn_1821) He waits for us, when it is said by
the prophet: “Wherefore the Lord waiteth to have compassion upon <span
id="page_430">p. 430</span> <span
id="iv.v.iv.xii-Page_430"></span>us;” <span
id="fr_1822"></span>[1823](#fn_1822) and He is waited for by us, when we
say: “I waited patiently for the Lord, and He inclined unto me;” and: “I
have waited for thy salvation, O Lord.” <span
id="fr_1823"></span>[1824](#fn_1823) He strengthens us when He says:
“And I have chastised them, and strengthened their arms; and they have
imagined evil against me;” <span id="fr_1824"></span>[1825](#fn_1824)
and He exhorts us to strengthen ourselves when He says: “Strengthen ye
the weak hands, and make strong the feeble knees.” <span
id="fr_1825"></span>[1826](#fn_1825) Jesus cries: “If any man thirst let
him come unto Me and drink;” <span id="fr_1826"></span>[1827](#fn_1826)
the prophet also cries to Him: “I have laboured with crying, my jaws are
become hoarse: mine eyes have failed, whilst I hope in my God.” <span
id="fr_1827"></span>[1828](#fn_1827) The Lord seeks us, when He says: “I
sought and there was no man. I called, and there was none to
answer;” <span id="fr_1828"></span>[1829](#fn_1828) and He Himself is
sought by the bride who mourns with tears: “I sought on my bed by night
Him whom my soul loved: I sought Him and found Him not; I called Him,
and He gave me no answer.” <span id="fr_1829"></span>[1830](#fn_1829)
