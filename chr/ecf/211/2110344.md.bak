#### <span id="iv.iii.iv.xv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XV.

<span id="iv.iii.iv.xv-p1"></span>Of the excessive desire of possession
among us.

<span id="iv.iii.iv.xv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.iv.xv-p2.1"></span>To</span> this what shall we wretched
creatures say, who though living in Cœnobia and established under the
government and care of an Abbot yet carry about our own keys, and
trampling under foot all feeling of shame and disgrace which should
spring from our profession, are not ashamed actually to wear openly upon
our fingers rings with which to seal what we have stored up; and in
whose case not merely boxes and baskets, but not even chests and closets
are sufficient for those things which we collect or which we reserved
when we forsook the world; and who sometimes get so angry over trifles
and mere nothings (to which however we lay claim as if they were our
own) that if any one dares to lay a finger on any of them, we are so
filled with rage against him that we cannot keep the wrath of our heart
from being expressed on our lips and in bodily excitement. But, passing
by our faults and treating with silence those things of which it is a
shame even to speak, according to this saying: “My mouth shall not speak
the deeds of men,” <span id="fr_769"></span>[770](#fn_769.md) let us in
accordance with the method of our narration which we have begun proceed
to those virtues which are practised among them, and which we ought to
aim at with all earnestness; and let us briefly and hastily set down the
actual rules and systems that afterwards, coming to some of the deeds
and acts of the elders which we propose carefully to preserve for
recollection, we may support by the strongest testimonies what we have
set forth in our treatise, and still further confirm everything that we
have said by examples and instances from life.
