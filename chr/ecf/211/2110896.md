#### <span id="iv.v.vii.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.

<span id="iv.v.vii.v-p1"></span>The answer, how a lasting friendship can
only exist among those who are perfect.

<span id="iv.v.vii.v-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.vii.v-p2.1"></span>Joseph</span>: For this reason we said that
the full and perfect grace of friendship can only last among those who
are perfect and of equal goodness, whose likemindedness and common
purpose allows them either never, or at any rate hardly ever, to
disagree, or to differ in those matters which concern their progress in
the spiritual life. But if they begin to get hot with eager disputes, it
is clear that they have never been at one in accordance with the rule
which we gave above. But because no one can start from perfection except
one who has begun from the very foundation, and your inquiring is not
with regard to its greatness, but as to how you can attain to it, I
think it well to explain to you, in a few words, the rule for it and the
sort of path along which your steps should be directed, that you may be
able more easily to secure the blessing of patience and peace.
