#### <span id="iv.vi.v.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VIII.

<span id="iv.vi.v.viii-p1"></span>How Theonas exhorted his wife that she
too should make her renunciation.

<span id="iv.vi.v.viii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.v.viii-p2.1"></span>And</span> when he had heard this the
blessed Theonas was fired with an uncontrollable <span id="page_506">p.
506</span> <span id="iv.vi.v.viii-Page_506"></span>desire for the
perfection of the gospel, and, committed, as it were, the seed of the
word, which he had received in a fruitful heart, to the deep and broken
furrows of his bosom, as he was greatly humiliated and
conscience-stricken because the old man had said not only that he had
failed to attain to the perfection of the gospel, but also that he had
scarcely fulfilled the commands of the law; since though he was
accustomed every year to pay the tithes of his fruits as alms, yet he
mourned that he had never even heard of the law of the firstfruits; and
even if he had in the same way fulfilled this, he humbly confessed that
still he would in the old man’s view have been very far from the
perfection of the gospel. And so he returned home sad and filled with
that sorrow which worketh repentance unto salvation, <span
id="fr_2177"></span>[2178](#fn_2177.md) and of his own will and
determination turns all his wife’s care and anxiety of mind towards
salvation; and began to stir her up to the same eager desire with which
he himself had been inflamed, with the same sort of exhortations, and
with tears day and night to urge her that together they might serve God
in sanctity and chastity, telling her that their conversion to a better
life ought not to be deferred because a vain hope in their youth would
be no argument against the inevitableness of a sudden death, which
carries off boys and youths and young persons equally with old men.
