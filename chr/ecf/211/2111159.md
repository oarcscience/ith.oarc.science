#### <span id="iv.vii.vii.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VIII.

<span id="iv.vii.vii.viii-p1"></span>How it can be said that Christ came
and was born of a Virgin.

<span id="iv.vii.vii.viii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.vii.viii-p2.1"></span>But</span> let us look at the remainder
which follows. As then the Creed says: “The Lord Jesus Christ, Very God
of Very God, Being of one substance with the Father; By whom both the
worlds were framed, and all things were made,” it immediately subjoins
in closest connexion the following, and says: “Who for us came and was
born of the Virgin Mary.” He then, who is Very God, who is of one
substance with the Father, who is the Maker of all things, He, I repeat,
came into the world and was born of the Virgin Mary; as the Apostle Paul
says: “But when the fulness of the times was come, God sent forth His
Son, made of a woman, made under the law.” <span
id="fr_2552"></span>[2553](#fn_2552.md) You see how the mysteries of the
Creed correspond with the Holy Scriptures. The Apostle declares that the
Son of God was “sent from the Father:” The Creed affirms that He “came.”
For it certainly follows that our faith should confess that He has
“come,” whom the Apostle had taught us to be sent. Then the Apostle
says: “Made of a woman:” The Creed, “born of Mary.” And so you see that
there speaks through the Creed the Scripture itself, from which the
Creed acknowledges that it is itself derived. But when the Apostle says,
“made of a woman,” he rightly enough uses “made” for “born,” after the
manner of Holy Scripture in which “made” stands for “born:” as in this
passage: “Instead of thy fathers there are made to thee sons:” <span
id="fr_2553"></span>[2554](#fn_2553.md) or this: “Before Abraham was made,
I am;” <span id="fr_2554"></span>[2555](#fn_2554.md) where we certainly see
clearly that He meant “Before he was born, I am:” alluding to the fact
of his birth under the term “was made,” because whatever does not need
to be made has the very reality of creation. “Who,” it then says, “for
us came and was born of the Virgin Mary.” If a mere man was born of
Mary, how can it be said that He “came”? For no one “comes” but He who
has it in Him to be able to come. But in the case of one who had not yet
received His existence, how could He have it in Him to come. You see
then how by the word “coming” it is shown that He who came was already
in existence: for He only had the power to come, to whom there could be
the opportunity of coming, from the fact that He was already existing.
But a mere man was certainly not in existence before he was conceived,
and so had not in himself the power <span id="page_596">p. 596</span>
<span id="iv.vii.vii.viii-Page_596"></span>to come. It is clear then
that it was God who came: to whom it belongs in each case both to *be*,
and to *come*. For certainly He *came* because He *was*, and He ever
*was*, because He could ever *come*.
