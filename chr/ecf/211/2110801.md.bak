#### <span id="iv.iv.x.xxxi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXI.

<span id="iv.iv.x.xxxi-p1"></span>The opinion of Abbot Antony on the
condition of prayer.

<span id="iv.iv.x.xxxi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.x.xxxi-p2.1"></span>And</span> that you may see the character
of true prayer I will give you not my own opinion but that of the
blessed Antony: whom we have known sometimes to have been so persistent
in prayer that often as he was praying in a transport of mind, when the
sunrise began to appear, we have heard him in the fervour of his spirit
declaiming: Why do you hinder me, O sun, who art arising for this very
purpose; viz., to withdraw me from the brightness of this true light?
And his also is this heavenly and more than human utterance on the end
of prayer: That is not, said he, a perfect prayer, wherein a monk
understands himself and the words which he prays. And if we too, as far
as our slender ability allows, may venture to add anything to this
splendid utterance, we will bring forward the marks of prayer which are
heard from the Lord, as far as we have tried them.
