#### <span id="iv.iii.ii.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.

<span id="iv.iii.ii.iv-p1"></span>How throughout the whole of Egypt and
the Thebaid the number of Psalms is fixed at twelve.

<span id="iv.iii.ii.iv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.ii.iv-p2.1"></span>So</span>, as we said, throughout the
whole of Egypt and the Thebaid the number of Psalms is fixed at twelve
both at Vespers and in the office of Nocturns, <span
id="fr_680"></span>[681](#fn_680.md) in such a way that at the close two
lessons follow, one from the Old and the other from the New
Testament. <span id="fr_681"></span>[682](#fn_681.md) And this arrangement,
fixed ever so long ago, has continued unbroken to the present day
throughout so many ages, in all the monasteries of those districts,
because it is said that it was no appointment of man’s invention, but
was brought down from heaven to the fathers by the ministry of an angel.

<span id="iv.iii.ii.iv-p3"></span> The rule of Cæsarius also prescribes
twelve Psalms on every Sabbath, Lord’s day, and festival (c. 25); so
also, according to the Benedictine rule, there are twelve Psalms at
mattins, besides the fixed ones, iii. and xcv. (see c. 9 and 10), as
there are still in the Roman Breviary on ordinary week-days.

<span id="fn_681"></span>[206:682](2110301.htm#fr_681.md) <span
id="iv.iii.ii.iv-p3.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.ii.iv-p4"></span> The custom of having *two* lessons
only appears to have been peculiar to Egypt. Most of the early Western
rules give *three*, e.g., those of Cæsarius and Benedict, while in the
Eastern daily offices there are no lections from Holy Scripture.

[Next: Chapter V. How the fact that the number of the Psalms was to be
twelve was received from the teaching of an angel.](2110302.md)
