#### <span id="iv.iv.viii.xx-p0.1"></span>Chapter XX.

<span id="iv.iv.viii.xx-p1"></span>Of the fact that opposite powers are
not of the same boldness, and that the occasions of temptation are not

indeed the same boldness and malice, and that with beginners and feeble
folk only the weaker spirits join battle, and when these spiritual
wickednesses are beaten, then gradually the assaults of stronger ones

checked their excessive attacks, and made with the temptation a way of
escape as well that we might be able to bear it. <span
