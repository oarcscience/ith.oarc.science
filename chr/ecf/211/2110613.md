<span id="iv.iv.iii.xxii-p1"></span>What is the usual limit both of
abstinence and of partaking food.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xxii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.iii.xxii-p2.1"></span>But</span> this is the usual limit of
abstinence; viz., for everyone to allow himself food according to the
requirements of his strength or bodily frame or age, in such quantity as
is required for the support of the flesh, and not for the satisfactory
feeling of repletion. For on both sides a man will suffer the greatest
injury, if having no fixed rule at one time he pinches his stomach with
meagre food and fasts, and at another stuffs it by over-eating himself;
for as the mind which is enfeebled for lack of food loses vigour in
praying, while it is worn out with excessive weakness of the flesh and
forced to doze, so again when weighed down with over-eating it cannot
pour forth to God pure and free prayers: nor will it succeed in
preserving uninterruptedly the purity of its chastity, while even on
those days on which it seems to chastise the flesh with severer
abstinence, it feeds the fire of carnal desire with the fuel of the food
that it has already taken.
