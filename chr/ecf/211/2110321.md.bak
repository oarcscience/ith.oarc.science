#### <span id="iv.iii.iii.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.

<span id="iv.iii.iii.v-p1"></span>How they ought not to go back to bed
again after the Mattin prayers.

<span id="iv.iii.iii.v-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.iii.v-p2.1"></span>But</span> some in this province, not
knowing the reason why this office was appointed and introduced, go back
again to bed after their Mattin prayers are finished, and in spite of it
fall into that very habit to check which our Elders instituted this
service. For they are eager to finish it at that hour, that an
opportunity maybe given, to those who are inclined to be indifferent and
not careful enough, to go back to bed again, which most certainly ought
not to be done (as we showed more fully in the previous book when
describing the service of the Egyptians), <span
id="fr_738"></span>[739](#fn_738.md) for fear lest the force of <span
id="page_216">p. 216</span> <span id="iv.iii.iii.v-Page_216"></span>our
natural passions should be aroused and stain that purity of ours which
was gained by humble confession and prayers before the dawn, or some
illusion of the enemy pollute us, or even the repose of a pure and
natural sleep interfere with the fervour of our spirit and make us lazy
and slothful throughout the whole day, as we are chilled by the
sluggishness caused by sleep. And to avoid this the Egyptians, and
especially as they are in the habit of rising at fixed times even before
the cock-crow, when the canonical office <span
id="fr_739"></span>[740](#fn_739.md) has been celebrated, afterwards
prolong their vigils even to daylight, that the morning light when it
comes on them may find them established in fervour of spirit, and keep
them still more careful and fervent all through the day, as it has found
them prepared for the conflict and strengthened against their daily
struggle with the devil by the practice of nocturnal vigils and
spiritual meditation.
