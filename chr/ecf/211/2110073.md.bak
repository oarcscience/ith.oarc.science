#### <span id="ii.iv.ii.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VIII.

<span id="ii.iv.ii.viii-p1"></span>“<span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.ii.viii-p1.1"></span>Admirably</span>,” exclaimed Postumianus,
“does your speech bind those friends of ours from going beyond the
example of Martin; but I own to you my belief that these remarks of
yours will fall upon deaf ears. For if we were to follow the ways of
Martin, we should never need to defend ourselves in the case of kissing,
and we should be free from all the reproaches of sinister opinion. But
as you are wont to say, when you are accused of being too fond of
eating, ‘We are Gauls,’ so we, for our part, who dwell in this district,
will never be reformed either by the example of Martin, or by your
dissertations. But while we have been discussing these points at so
great length, why do you, Sulpitius, preserve such an obstinate
silence?”

<span id="ii.iv.ii.viii-p2"></span>“Well, for my part,” replied I, “I
not only keep silence, but for a long time past I have determined to be
silent upon such points. For, because I rebuked a certain spruce
gadding-about widow, who dressed expensively, and lived in a somewhat
loose manner, and also a virgin, who was following somewhat indecently a
certain young man who was dear to me,—although, to be sure, I had often
heard her blaming others who acted in such a manner,—I raised up against
me such a degree of hatred on the part of all the women and all the
monks, that both bands entered upon sworn war against me. Wherefore, be
quiet, I beg of you, lest even what we are saying should tend to
increase their animosity towards me. Let us entirely blot out these
people from our memory, and let us rather return to Martin. Do thou,
friend Gaul, as you have begun, carry out the work you have taken in
hand.”

<span id="ii.iv.ii.viii-p3"></span>Then says he: “I have really related
already so many things to you, that my speech ought to have satisfied
your desires; but, because I am not at liberty to refuse compliance with
your wishes, I shall continue to speak as long as the day lasts. For, in
truth, when I glance at that straw, which is being prepared for our
beds, there comes into my mind a recollection respecting the straw on
which Martin had lain, that a miracle was wrought in connection with it.
The affair took place as follows. Claudiomagus is a village on the
confines of the Bituriges and the Turoni. The church there is celebrated
for the piety of the saints, and is not less illustrious for the
multitude of the holy virgins. Well, Martin, being in the habit of
passing that way, had an apartment in the private part of the church.
After he left, all the virgins used to rush into that retirement: they
kiss <span id="fr_120"></span>[121](#fn_120.md) every place where the
blessed man had either sat or stood, and distribute among themselves the
very straw on which he had lain. One of them, a few days afterwards,
took a part of the straw which she had collected for a blessing to
herself, and hung it from the neck of a possessed person, whom a spirit
of error was troubling. There was no delay; but sooner than one could
speak the demon was cast out, and the person was cured.
