#### <span id="ii.vi.i.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VIII.

<span id="ii.vi.i.viii-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.vi.i.viii-p1.1"></span>Now</span>, Rebecca, having long been
barren, at length, through the unceasing prayers of her husband to the
Lord, brought forth twins about twenty years after the time of her
marriage. These are said to have often leaped <span
id="fr_258"></span>[259](#fn_258.md) in the womb of their mother; and it
was announced by the answer of the Lord on this subject, that two
peoples were foretold in these children, and that the elder would, in
rank, be inferior to the younger. Well, the first that was born,
bristling over with hair, was called Esau, while Jacob was the name
given to the younger. At that time, a grievous famine had taken place.
Under the pressure of this necessity, Isaac went to Gerar, to King
Abimelech, having been warned by the Lord not to go down into Egypt.
There he is promised the possession of the whole land, and is blessed,
and having been greatly increased in cattle and every kind of substance,
he is, under the influence of envy, driven out by the inhabitants. Thus
expelled from that region, he sojourned by the well, known as “the
well <span id="fr_259"></span>[260](#fn_259.md) of the oath.” By and by,
being advanced in years, and his eyesight being gone, as he made ready
to bless his son Esau, Jacob through the counsel of his mother, Rebecca,
presented himself to be blessed in the place of his brother. Thus Jacob
is set before his brother as the one to be honored by the princes and
the peoples. Esau, enraged by these occurrences, plotted the death of
his brother. Jacob, owing to the fear thus excited, and by the advice of
his mother, fled into Mesopotamia, having been urged by his father to
take a wife of the house of Laban, Rebecca’s brother: so great was their
care, while they dwelt in a strange country, that their children should
marry within their own kindred. Thus Jacob, setting out for Mesopotamia,
is said in sleep to have had a vision of the Lord; and on that account
regarding the place of his dream as sacred, he took a stone from it; and
he vowed that, if he returned in prosperity, the name <span
id="fr_260"></span>[261](#fn_260.md) of the pillar should be the “house of
the Lord,” and that he would devote to God the tithes of all the
possessions he had gained. Then he betook himself to Laban, his mother’s
brother, and was kindly received by him to share in his hospitality as
the acknowledged son of his sister.

<span id="ii.vi.i.viii-p2"></span> So in LXX.

<span id="ii.vi.i.viii-p3"></span> This is the meaning of the Hebrew
word, *Beersheba*.

<span id="fn_260"></span>[74:261](2110142.htm#fr_260.md) <span
id="ii.vi.i.viii-p3.1"></span>

<span id="ii.vi.i.viii-p4"></span> “Titulum sibi domus Dei futurum”: the
rendering of the Hebrew original is here obviously faulty, and the
words, as they stand, are scarcely intelligible.
