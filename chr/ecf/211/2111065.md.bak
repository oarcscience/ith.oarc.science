#### <span id="iv.vi.viii.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.

<span id="iv.vi.viii.v-p1"></span>That anxiety of heart is made worse
rather than better by restlessness of body.

<span id="iv.vi.viii.v-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.viii.v-p2.1"></span>Nor</span> is it wonderful if one who
lives in a cell, having his thoughts collected together as it were in a
narrow cloister, is oppressed by a multitude of anxieties, which break
out with the man himself from the confinement of the dwelling, and at
once dash here and there like wild horses. But while they are now
roaming at large from their stalls, for the moment some short and sad
solace is enjoyed: but when, after the body has returned to its own
cell, the whole troop of thoughts retires again to its proper home, the
habit of chronic licence gives rise to worse pangs. Those then who are
unable and ignorant how to struggle against the promptings of their own
fancies, when they are harassed in their cell, by accidie attacking
their bosom more violently <span id="page_534">p. 534</span> <span
id="iv.vi.viii.v-Page_534"></span>than usual, if they relax their strict
rule and allow themselves the liberty of going out oftener, will arouse
a worse plague against themselves by means of this which they fancy is a
remedy: just as men fancy that they can check the violence of an inward
fever by a draught of the coldest water, though it is a fact that by it
its fire is inflamed rather than quenched, as a far worse attack follows
after the momentary alleviation.
