#### <span id="iv.iii.iii.ii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.

<span id="iv.iii.iii.ii-p1"></span>How among the Egyptians they apply
themselves all day long to prayer and Psalm continually, with the
addition of work, without distinction of hours.

<span id="iv.iii.iii.ii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.iii.ii-p2.1"></span>For</span> among them (viz., the
Egyptians) these offices which we are taught to render to the Lord at
separate hours and at intervals of time, with a reminder from the
convener, are celebrated continuously throughout the whole <span
id="page_213">p. 213</span> <span
id="iv.iii.iii.ii-Page_213"></span>day, with the addition of work, and
that of their own free will. For manual labour is incessantly practised
by them in their cells in such a way that meditation on the Psalms and
the rest of the Scriptures is never entirely omitted. And as with it at
every moment they mingle suffrages and prayers, they spend the whole day
in those offices which we celebrate at fixed times. Wherefore, except
Vespers and Nocturns, there are no public services among them in the day
except on Saturday and Sunday, when they meet together at the third hour
for the purpose of Holy Communion. <span
id="fr_716"></span>[717](#fn_716.md) For that which is continuously offered
is more than what is rendered at intervals of time; and more acceptable
as a free gift than the duties which are performed by the compulsion of
a rule: as David for this rejoices somewhat exultingly when he says,
“Freely will I sacrifice unto Thee;” and, “Let the free will offerings
of my mouth be pleasing to Thee, O Lord.” <span

<span id="iv.iii.iii.ii-p3"></span> The *Saturday* Communion (in
addition to that of Wednesday and Friday, as well as Sunday) is also
mentioned by S. Basil (*Ep*. xciii.), and cf. the Forty-ninth Canon of
the Council of Laodicæa (circa 360 <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.iii.ii-p3.1"></span>a.d.</span>): “During Lent the bread
shall not be offered except on Saturday and Sunday.” In the West there
is no trace of a special Saturday celebration of the Holy Communion.

<span id="iv.iii.iii.ii-p4"></span>The third hour was the ordinary time
for Holy Communion, as may be seen from the decree (falsely) ascribed to
Pope Telesphorus (<span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.iii.ii-p4.1"></span>a.d.</span> 127–138), in the *Liber
Pontificalis*: “Ut nullus ante horam tertiam sacrificium offere
præsumeret,” and many other testimonies.

Sext, and None are ended with only three Psalms and prayers each; and
the reason why these spiritual offices are assigned more particularly to
those hours.](2110319.md)
