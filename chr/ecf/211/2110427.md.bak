#### <span id="iv.iii.vii.xi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XI.

<span id="iv.iii.vii.xi-p1"></span>That under pretence of keeping the
purse women have to besought to dwell with them.

<span id="iv.iii.vii.xi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.vii.xi-p2.1"></span>Hence</span> many are led on over an
abrupt precipice, and by an irrevocable fall, to death, and not content
to possess by themselves that money which they either never had before,
or which by a bad beginning they kept back, they seek for women to dwell
with them, to preserve what they have unjustifiably amassed or retained.
And they implicate themselves in so many harmful and dangerous
occupations, that they are cast down even to the depths of hell, while
they refuse to acquiesce in that saying of the Apostle, that “having
food and clothing they should be content” with that which the thrift of
the monastery supplied, but “wishing to become rich they fall into
temptation and the snare of the devil, and many unprofitable and hurtful
desires, which drown men in destruction and perdition. For the love of
money,” i.e. covetousness, “is a root of all kinds of evil, which some
coveting have erred from the faith, and have entangled themselves in
many sorrows.” <span id="fr_881"></span>[882](#fn_881.md)
