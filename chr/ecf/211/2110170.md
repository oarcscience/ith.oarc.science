#### <span id="ii.vi.i.xxxvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXVI.

<span id="ii.vi.i.xxxvi-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.vi.i.xxxvi-p1.1"></span>At</span> that time Samuel died. Saul,
when the Philistines made war upon him, consulted God, and no answer was
returned to him. Then, by means of a woman whose entrails a spirit of
error <span id="fr_306"></span>[307](#fn_306.md) had filled, he called up
and consulted Samuel. Saul was informed by him that on the following day
he with his sons, being overcome by the Philistines, would fall in the
battle. The Philistines, accordingly, having pitched their camp on the
enemy’s territory, drew up their army in battle array on the following
day, David, however, being sent away from the camp, because they did not
believe that he would be faithful to them against his own people. But
the battle taking place, the Hebrews were routed and the sons of the
king fell; Saul, having sunk down from his horse, that he might not be
taken alive by the enemy, fell on his own sword. We do not find any
certain statements as to the length of his reign, unless that he is said
in the Acts of the Apostles to have reigned forty years. As to this,
however, I am inclined to think that Paul, who made the statement in his
preaching, then meant to include also the years of Samuel under the
length of that king’s reign. <span id="fr_307"></span>[308](#fn_307.md)
Most of those, however, who have written about these times, remark that
he reigned thirty years. I can, by no means, agree with this opinion,
for at the time when the ark of God was transferred to the town of
Cariathiarim, Saul had not yet begun to reign, and it is related that
the ark was removed by David the king out of that town after it had been
there twenty years. Therefore, since Saul reigned and died within that
period, he must have held the government only for a very brief space of
time. We find the same obscurity concerning the times of Samuel, who,
having been born under the priesthood of Eli, is related, when very old,
to have fulfilled the duties of a priest. By some, however, who have
written about these times (for the sacred history has recorded almost
nothing about his years), <span id="fr_308"></span>[309](#fn_308.md) but by
most he is said to have ruled the people seventy years. I have, however,
been unable to discover what authority there is for this assumption.
Amid such variety of error, we have followed the account of the
Chronicles, <span id="fr_309"></span>[310](#fn_309.md) because we think
that it was taken (as said above) from the Acts of the Apostles, and we
repeat that Samuel and Saul together held the government for forty
years.
