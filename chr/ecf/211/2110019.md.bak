#### <span id="ii.ii.xvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XV.

<span id="ii.ii.xvi-p1"></span>Martin offers his Neck to an Assassin.

<span id="ii.ii.xvi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.ii.xvi-p2.1"></span>I shall</span> also relate what took place in
the village of the Ædui. When Martin was there overthrowing a temple, a
multitude of rustic heathen rushed upon him in a frenzy of rage. And
when one of them, bolder than the rest, made an attack upon him with a
drawn sword, Martin, throwing back his cloak, offered his bare neck to
the assassin. Nor did the heathen delay to strike, but in the very act
of lifting up his right arm, he fell to the ground on his back, and
being overwhelmed by the fear of God, he entreated for pardon. Not
unlike this was that other event which happened to Martin, that when a
certain man had resolved to wound him with a knife as he was destroying
some idols, at the very moment of fetching the blow, the weapon was
struck out of his hands and disappeared. Very frequently, too, when the
pagans were addressing him to the effect that he would not overthrow
their temples, he so soothed and conciliated the minds of the heathen by
his holy discourse that, the light of truth having been revealed to
them, they themselves overthrew their own temples.
