#### <span id="ii.vi.ii.xxv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXV.

<span id="ii.vi.ii.xxv-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.vi.ii.xxv-p1.1"></span>Demetrius,</span> having thus obtained the
kingdom, treated Jonathan with kindness, made a treaty with him, and
restored the Jews to their own laws. In the meantime, Tryphon, who had
belonged to the party of Alexander, was appointed <span
id="fr_348"></span>[349](#fn_348) governor of Syria, to keep him in
check by war. Jonathan, <span id="fr_349"></span>[350](#fn_349) on the
other hand, descended to battle, formidable with an army of forty
thousand men. Tryphon, when he saw himself unequal to the contest,
pretended a desire for peace, and slew Ptolemais who had been received
and invited into friendship with him. After Jonathan, the chief power
was conferred on his brother Simon. He celebrated the funeral of his
brother with great pomp, and built those well-known seven pyramids of
most noble workmanship, in which he buried the remains both of his
brothers and of his father. Then Demetrius renewed his treaty with the
Jews; and in consideration of the loss caused to them by Tryphon (for
after the death of Jonathan he had wasted by war their cities and
territories), he remitted to them their annual tribute forever; for up
to that time, they had paid tribute to the kings of Syria, except when
they resisted by force of arms. That took place in the second year of
king Demetrius; and we have noted that, because up to this year we have
run through the times of the Asiatic kings, that the series of dates
being given in order might be perfectly clear. But now we shall arrange
the order of events through the times of those, who were either
high-priests or kings among the Jews, up to the period of the birth of
Christ.

taken Jonathan as a nominative, but the passage is very obscure.
