#### <span id="iv.iii.vii.xxii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXII.

<span id="iv.iii.vii.xxii-p1"></span>That one who actually has no money
may still be deemed covetous.

<span id="iv.iii.vii.xxii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.vii.xxii-p2.1"></span>For</span> it is possible even for one
who has no money to be by no means free from the malady of covetousness,
and for the blessing of penury to do him no good, because he has not
been able to root out the sin of cupidity: delighting in the advantages
of poverty, not in the merit of the virtue, and satisfied with the
burden of necessity, not without coldness of heart. For just as the word
of the gospel declares of those who are not defiled in body, that they
are adulterers in heart; <span id="fr_901"></span>[902](#fn_901.md) so it
is possible that those who are in no way pressed down with the weight of
money may be condemned with the covetous in disposition and intent. For
it was the opportunity of possessing which was wanting in their case,
and not the will for it: which latter is always crowned by God, rather
than compulsion. And so we must use all diligence lest the fruits of our
labours should be destroyed to no purpose. For it is a wretched thing to
have endured the effects of poverty and want, but to have lost their
fruits, through the fault of a shattered will.
