#### <span id="ii.iv.i.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.

<span id="ii.iv.i.vi-p1"></span>“<span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.i.vi-p1.1"></span>After</span> he had kindly accepted our
gifts, on the sailors calling us back to the sea, we departed; and after
a favorable passage, we arrived at Alexandria on the seventh day. There
we found a disgraceful strife raging between the bishops and monks, the
cause or occasion of which was that the priests were known when
assembled together often to have passed decrees in crowded synods to the
effect that no one should read or possess the books of Origen. He was,
no doubt, regarded as a most able disputant on the sacred Scriptures.
But the bishops maintained that there were certain things in his books
of an unsound character; and his supporters, not being bold enough to
defend these, rather took the line of declaring that they had been
inserted by the heretics. They affirmed, therefore, that the other
portions of his writings were not to be condemned on account of those
things which justly fell under censure, since the faith of readers could
easily make a distinction, so that they should not follow what had been
forged, and yet should keep hold of those points which were handled in
accordance with the Catholic faith. They remarked that there was nothing
wonderful if, in modern and recent writings, heretical guile had been at
work; since it had not feared in certain places to attack even Gospel
truth. The bishops, struggling against these positions <span
id="page_27">p. 27</span> <span id="ii.iv.i.vi-Page_27"></span>to the
utmost extent of their power, insisted that what was quite correct in
the writings of Origen should, along with the author himself, and even
his whole works, be condemned, because those books were more than
sufficient which the church had received. They also said that the
reading was to be avoided of such works as would do more harm to the
unwise than they would benefit the wise. For my part, on being led by
curiosity to investigate some portions of these writings, I found very
many things which pleased me, but some that were to be blamed. I think
it is clear that the author himself really entertained these impious
opinions, though his defenders maintain that the passages have been
forged. I truly wonder that one and the same man could have been so
different from himself as that, in the portion which is approved, he has
no equal since the times of the Apostles, while in that which is justly
condemned, no one can be shown to have erred more egregiously.
