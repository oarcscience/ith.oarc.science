### <span id="ii.iii.iii-p0.1"></span>Letter III. To Bassula, His Mother-In-Law.

<span id="ii.iii.iii-p1"></span>How St. Martin passed from this Life to
Life Eternal.

<span id="ii.iii.iii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iii.iii-p2.1"></span>Sulpitius Severus</span> to Bassula, his
venerable parent, sendeth greeting.

<span id="ii.iii.iii-p3"></span>If it were lawful that parents should be
summoned to court by their children, clearly I might drag you with a
righteous thong <span id="fr_63"></span>[64](#fn_63.md) before the tribunal
of the prætor, on a charge of robbery and plunder. For why should I not
complain of the injury which I have suffered at your hands? You have
left me no little bit of writing at home, no book, not even a letter—to
such a degree do you play the thief with all such things and publish
them to the world. If I write anything in familiar style to a friend;
if, as I amuse myself I dictate anything with the wish at the same time
that it should be kept private, all such things seem to reach you almost
before they have been written or spoken. Surely you have my
secretaries <span id="fr_64"></span>[65](#fn_64.md) in your <span
id="fr_65"></span>[66](#fn_65.md) debt, since through them any trifles I
compose are made known to you. And yet I cannot be moved with anger
against them if they really obey you, and have invaded my rights under
the special influence of your generosity to them, and ever bear in mind
that they belong to you rather than to me. Yes, thou alone art the
culprit—thou alone art to blame—inasmuch as you both lay your snares for
me, and cajole them with your trickery, so that without making any <span
id="fr_66"></span>[67](#fn_66.md) selection, pieces written familiarly, or
let out of hand without care, are sent to thee quite unelaborated and
unpolished. For, to say nothing about other writings, I beg to ask how
that letter could reach you so speedily, which I recently wrote to
Aurelius the Deacon. For, <span id="page_22">p. 22</span> <span
id="ii.iii.iii-Page_22"></span>as I was situated at Toulouse, <span
id="fr_67"></span>[68](#fn_67.md) while you were dwelling at Treves, and
were so far distant from your native land, owing to the anxiety felt on
account of your son, what opportunity, I should like to know, did you
avail yourself of, to get hold of that familiar <span
id="fr_68"></span>[69](#fn_68.md) epistle? For I have received your letter
in which you write that I ought in the same epistle in which I made
mention of the death of our master, Martin, to have described the manner
in which that saintly man left this world. As if, indeed, I had either
given forth that epistle with the view of its being read by any other
except him to whom it purported to be sent; or as if I were fated to
undertake so great a work as that all things which should be known
respecting Martin are to be made public through me particularly as the
writer. Therefore, if you desire to learn anything concerning the end of
the saintly bishop, you should direct your enquiries rather to those who
were present when his death occurred. I for my part have resolved to
write nothing to you lest you publish me <span
id="fr_69"></span>[70](#fn_69.md) everywhere. Nevertheless if you pledge
your word that you will read to no one what I send you, I shall satisfy
your desire in a few words. Accordingly I shall communicate <span
id="fr_70"></span>[71](#fn_70.md) to you the following particulars which
are comprised within my own knowledge.

<span id="ii.iii.iii-p12"></span>I have to state, then, that Martin was
aware of the period of his own death long before it occurred, and told
the brethren that his departure from the body was at hand. In the
meantime, a reason sprang up which led him to visit the church at
Condate. <span id="fr_71"></span>[72](#fn_71.md) For, as the clerics of
that church were at variance among themselves, Martin, wishing to
restore peace, although he well knew that the end of his own days was at
hand, yet he did not shrink from undertaking the journey, with such an
object in view. He did, in fact, think that this would be an excellent
crown to set upon his virtues, if he should leave behind him peace
restored to a church. Thus, then, having set out with that very numerous
and holy crowd of disciples who usually accompanied him, he perceives in
a river a number of water-fowl busy in capturing fishes, and notices
that a voracious appetite was urging them on to frequent seizures of
their prey. “This,” exclaimed he, “is a picture of how the demons act:
they lie in wait for the unwary and capture them before they know it:
they devour their victims when taken, and they can never be satisfied
with what they have devoured.” Then Martin, with a miraculous <span
id="fr_72"></span>[73](#fn_72.md) power in his words, commands the birds to
leave the pool in which they were swimming, and to betake themselves to
dry and desert regions; using with respect to those birds that very same
authority with which he had been accustomed to put demons to flight.
Accordingly, gathering themselves together, all those birds formed a
single body, and leaving the river, they made for the mountains and
woods, to no small wonder of many who perceived such power in Martin
that he could even rule the birds. Having then delayed some time in that
village or church to which he had gone, and peace having been restored
among the clerics, when he was now meditating a return to his monastery,
he began suddenly to fail in bodily strength, and, assembling the
brethren, he told them that he was on the point of dissolution. Then
indeed, sorrow and grief took possession of all, and there was but one
voice of them lamenting, and saying: “Why, dear father, will you leave
us? Or to whom can you commit us in our desolation? Fierce wolves will
speedily attack thy flock, and who, when the shepherd has been smitten,
will save us <span id="fr_73"></span>[74](#fn_73.md) from their bites? We
know, indeed, that you desire to be with Christ; but thy reward above is
safe, and will not be diminished by being delayed; rather have pity upon
us, whom you are leaving desolate.” Then Martin, affected by these
lamentations, as he was always, in truth, full <span
id="fr_74"></span>[75](#fn_74.md) of compassion, is said to have burst into
tears; and, turning to the Lord, he replied to those weeping round him
only in the following words, “O Lord, if I am still necessary to thy
people, I do not shrink from toil: thy will be done.” Thus hovering as
he did between <span id="fr_75"></span>[76](#fn_75.md) desire and love, he
almost doubted which he preferred; for he neither wished to leave us,
nor to be longer separated from Christ. However, he placed no weight
upon his own wishes, nor reserved anything to his own will, but
committed himself wholly to the will and power of the Lord. Do you not
think you hear him speaking in the following few words which I repeat?
“Terrible, indeed, Lord, is the struggle of bodily warfare, and surely
it is now enough that I have continued the fight till now; but, if thou
dost command me still to persevere in the same toil for the
defense <span id="fr_76"></span>[77](#fn_76.md) of thy flock, I do not
refuse, nor do I plead against such an appointment <span id="page_23">p.
23</span> <span id="ii.iii.iii-Page_23"></span> my declining years.
Wholly given to thee, I will fulfill whatever duties thou dost assign
me, and I will serve under thy standard as long as thou shalt prescribe.
Yea, although release is sweet to an old man after lengthened toil, yet
my mind is a conqueror over my years, and I have no desire <span
id="fr_77"></span>[78](#fn_77.md) to yield to old age. But if now thou art
merciful to my many years, good, O Lord, is thy will to me; and thou
thyself wilt guard over those for whose safety I fear.” O man, whom no
language can describe, unconquered by toil, and unconquerable even by
death, who didst show no personal preference for either alternative, and
who didst neither fear to die nor refuse to live! Accordingly, though he
was for some days under the influence of a strong fever, he nevertheless
did not abandon the work of God. Continuing in supplications and
watchings through whole nights, he compelled his worn-out limbs to do
service to his spirit as he lay on his glorious <span
id="fr_78"></span>[79](#fn_78.md) couch upon sackcloth and ashes. And when
his disciples begged of him that at least he should allow some common
straw to be placed beneath him, he replied: “It is not fitting that a
Christian should die except among ashes; and I have sinned if I leave
you a different example.” However, with his hands and eyes steadfastly
directed towards heaven, he never released his unconquerable spirit from
prayer. And on being asked by the presbyters who had then gathered round
him, to relieve his body a little by a change of side, he exclaimed:
“Allow me, dear brother, to fix my looks rather on heaven than on earth,
so that my spirit which is just about to depart on its own journey may
be directed towards the Lord.” Having spoken these words, he saw the
devil standing close at hand, and exclaimed: “Why do you stand here,
thou bloody monster? Thou shalt find nothing in me, thou deadly one:
Abraham’s bosom is about to receive me.”

<span id="ii.iii.iii-p21"></span>As he uttered these words, his spirit
fled; and those who were there present have testified to us that they
saw his face as if it had been the face <span
id="fr_79"></span>[80](#fn_79.md) of an angel. His limbs too appeared white
as snow, so that people exclaimed, “Who would ever believe that man to
be clothed in sackcloth, or who would imagine that he was enveloped with
ashes?” For even then he presented such an appearance, as if he had been
manifested in the glory of the future resurrection, and with the nature
of a body which had been changed. But it is hardly credible what a
multitude of human beings assembled at the performance of his funeral
rites: the whole city poured forth to meet his body; all the inhabitants
of the district and villages, along with many also from the neighboring
cities, attended. O how great was the grief of all! how deep the
lamentations in particular of the sorrowing monks! They are said to have
assembled on that day almost to the number of two thousand,—a special
glory of Martin,—through his example so numerous plants had sprung up
for the service of the Lord. Undoubtedly the shepherd was then driving
his own flocks before him—the pale crowds of that saintly
multitude—bands arrayed in cloaks, either old men whose life-labor was
finished, or young soldiers who had just taken the oath of allegiance to
Christ. Then, too, there was the choir of virgins, abstaining out of
modesty from weeping; and with what holy joy did they conceal the fact
of their affliction! No doubt faith would prevent the shedding of tears,
yet affection forced out groans. For there was as sacred an exultation
over the glory to which he had attained, as there was a pious sorrow on
account of his death. One would have been inclined to pardon those who
wept, as well as to congratulate those who rejoiced, while each single
person preferred that he himself should grieve, but that another should
rejoice. Thus then this multitude, singing hymns of heaven, attended the
body of the sainted man onwards to the place of sepulture. Let there be
compared with this spectacle, I will not say the worldly <span
id="fr_80"></span>[81](#fn_80.md) pomp of a funeral, but even of a triumph;
and what can be reckoned similar to the obsequies of Martin? Let your
worldly great men lead before their chariots captives with their hands
bound behind their backs. Those accompanied the body of Martin who,
under his guidance, had overcome the world. Let madness honor these
earthly warriors with the united praises of nations. Martin is praised
with the divine psalms, Martin is honored in heavenly hymns. Those
worldly men, after their triumphs here are over, shall be thrust into
cruel Tartarus, while Martin is joyfully received into the bosom of
Abraham. Martin, poor and insignificant on earth, has a rich entrance
granted him into heaven. From that blessed region, as I trust, he looks
upon me, as my guardian, while I am writing these things, and upon you
while you read them. <span id="fr_81"></span>[82](#fn_81.md)

<span id="fn_63"></span>[21:64](2110035.htm#fr_63.md) <span
id="ii.iii.iii-p3.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.iii-p4"></span> Instead of “justo loro,” Halm reads,
“justo delore,” i.e. “with just resentment.”

<span id="fn_64"></span>[21:65](2110035.htm#fr_64.md) <span
id="ii.iii.iii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.iii-p5"></span> “notarios”: shorthand writers, who
wrote from dictation.

<span id="fn_65"></span>[21:66](2110035.htm#fr_65.md) <span
id="ii.iii.iii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.iii-p6"></span> Halm here reads “obarratos,” with what
sense I know not: the reading “obæratos,” followed in the text seems to
yield a very good meaning.

<span id="fn_66"></span>[21:67](2110035.htm#fr_66.md) <span
id="ii.iii.iii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.iii-p7"></span> The reading “sine dilectu ullo,”
adopted by Halm, seems preferable to the old reading, “sine delicto
ullo.”

<span id="fn_67"></span>[22:68](2110035.htm#fr_67.md) <span
id="ii.iii.iii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.iii-p8"></span> The identity of Tolosa, mentioned in
the text with the modern Toulouse, is uncertain.

<span id="fn_68"></span>[22:69](2110035.htm#fr_68.md) <span
id="ii.iii.iii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.iii-p9"></span> Of course, this is all jocular, and
shows the best relations as existing between Sulpitius and his
mother-in-law.

<span id="fn_69"></span>[22:70](2110035.htm#fr_69.md) <span
id="ii.iii.iii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.iii-p10"></span> There is clearly some affectation in
the horror which Sulpitius expresses in this and other passages at the
thought of his writings being published. It is obvious that he derived
gratification from the fact of their being widely read.

<span id="fn_70"></span>[22:71](2110035.htm#fr_70.md) <span
id="ii.iii.iii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.iii-p11"></span> “præstabo his participem”: the
construction is peculiar, but the meaning is obvious.

<span id="fn_71"></span>[22:72](2110035.htm#fr_71.md) <span
id="ii.iii.iii-p12.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.iii-p13"></span> There were several towns of this name
in Gaul. The one probably here referred to was on the road from
Augustodunum (Autun) to Paris. It corresponds to the modern Cosne, at
the junction of the stream Nonain with the river Loire.

<span id="fn_72"></span>[22:73](2110035.htm#fr_72.md) <span
id="ii.iii.iii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.iii-p14"></span> “potenti virtute verborum”: Halm reads
simply “potenti verbo.”

<span id="fn_73"></span>[22:74](2110035.htm#fr_73.md) <span
id="ii.iii.iii-p14.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.iii-p15"></span> A singular and obviously corrupt
reading is “quis eos a morsibus nostris prohibebit?” Halm’s reading has
been followed in the text.

<span id="fn_74"></span>[22:75](2110035.htm#fr_74.md) <span
id="ii.iii.iii-p15.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.iii-p16"></span> Lit. “as he always flowed with bowels
of mercy in the Lord.”

<span id="fn_75"></span>[22:76](2110035.htm#fr_75.md) <span
id="ii.iii.iii-p16.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.iii-p17"></span> “spes” seems here to mean “longing of
heart.”

<span id="fn_76"></span>[22:77](2110035.htm#fr_76.md) <span
id="ii.iii.iii-p17.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.iii-p18"></span> “pro castris tuorum.”

<span id="fn_77"></span>[23:78](2110035.htm#fr_77.md) <span
id="ii.iii.iii-p18.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.iii-p19"></span> Or “I am not one to yield,” *nescius
cedere*.

<span id="fn_78"></span>[23:79](2110035.htm#fr_78.md) <span
id="ii.iii.iii-p19.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.iii-p20"></span> “nobili illo strato suo”; *nobilis* in
one sense, though so humble in another.

<span id="fn_79"></span>[23:80](2110035.htm#fr_79.md) <span
id="ii.iii.iii-p21.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.iii-p22"></span> There is a great variety of readings
here; Halm has been followed in the text.

<span id="fn_80"></span>[23:81](2110035.htm#fr_80.md) <span
id="ii.iii.iii-p22.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.iii-p23"></span> Or, “the pomp of a worldly funeral.”

<span id="fn_81"></span>[23:82](2110035.htm#fr_81.md) <span
id="ii.iii.iii-p23.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.iii-p24"></span> Halm inserts this last sentence in
brackets.
