#### <span id="iv.i.ii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.

<span id="iv.i.ii-p1"></span>The History of Cassian’s Writings, MSS.,
and Editions.

<span id="iv.i.ii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.ii-p2.1"></span>The</span> literary history of Cassian’s works
is not without an interest of its own. We have already seen the
estimation in which they were held in spite of their Semi-Pelagian
doctrines. These were naturally accounted a blemish, and it is not
surprising that those who most admired their excellences were anxious to
avoid propagating their errors. Hence they were often “expurgated,” and
in many <span class="sc"><span id="iv.i.ii-p2.2"></span>mss.</span> the
text has suffered considerably from the changes made by copyists in the
interests of orthodoxy. As early as the fifth century we find two
revised versions of portions of his works existing. His friend
Eucherius, Bishop of Lyons, <span id="page_194">p. 194</span> <span
id="iv.i.ii-Page_194"></span>was the author of an epitome of the
Institutes, which still exists; <span id="fr_620"></span>[621](#fn_620.md)
and although this was compiled for convenience’ sake because of the
length of the original work, rather than from any suspicion of his
teaching, the case is different with a recension made for use in Africa
by Victor, Bishop of Martyrites. This is no longer extant, but
Cassiodorus distinctly tells us that it was made in the interests of
orthodoxy by means of expurgation as well as addition of what was
wanting. <span id="fr_621"></span>[622](#fn_621.md) Yet another epitome of
three of the Conferences (I., II., VII.) was made at some time before
the tenth century. It was translated into Greek, and known to Photius,
who speaks <span id="fr_622"></span>[623](#fn_622.md) of three works of
Cassian as translated into Greek: viz., (1) an Epitome of the
Institutes, Books I.–IV.; (2) Epitome of the Institutes, Books V.–XII.;
and (3) one of the Conferences I., II., VII.

<span id="iv.i.ii-p6"></span>Thus in very early days the fashion was set
of expurgating and emending the writings of Cassian; and Leuwis de
Ryckel, better known as Dionysius Carthusianus, might have quoted
several precedents for his method of dealing with the text. This famous
divine,—the *doctor exstaticus* of the fifteenth century,—shocked as
others had been before him at the Semi-Pelagianism of the Conferences,
and yet sensible of their real value in spite of sundry blemishes, took
in hand to correct them, and gave to the world a free paraphrase both of
the Institutes and of the Conferences, in a somewhat simple style and
one more easy to be understood than the original. The greatest
alterations, as might be expected, are visible in the thirteenth
Conference; as Dionysius, in his endeavour to make Cassian orthodox,
omits all that savours of Semi-Pelagianism; and from c. viii. onward
there are large omissions and various suggestive alterations in the
text. <span id="fr_623"></span>[624](#fn_623.md)

<span id="iv.i.ii-p9"></span>Incidental mention has been already made of
the esteem in which the Institutes and Conferences were held by S.
Benedict and Cassiodorus. In the Rule of the former (c. xlii.) it is
ordered that after supper the brethren should assemble together, and one
of them should read the Conferences, or Lives of the Fathers, or any
other book calculated to edify. And again, in the closing chapter of the
same rule, the study of them is recommended to those who are desirous of
perfection; for “what are the Conferences of the Fathers, the
Institutes, and the lives of them; what, too, the Rule of our holy
father, S. Basil, but examples of virtuous and obedient monks, and helps
to the attainment of virtue?” Equally strong is the recommendation of
Cassiodorus: “Sedulo legite, frequenter audite;” but at the same time he
reminds his readers that Cassian was very properly censured by Prosper
for his teaching on Freewill, and that, therefore, he is to be read with
caution whenever he touches on this subject. With testimonies such as
these to their value it is no wonder that copies were rapidly
multiplied, so that scarcely a monastery was without a copy of some part
of them; and existing <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.ii-p9.1"></span>mss.</span> of the Institutes and Conferences
are very numerous. But none of the oldest <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.ii-p9.2"></span>mss.</span> contain the complete work. The
institutes were often regarded as made up of two separate treatises,—(1)
the Institutes of the Cœnobia, containing Books I.–IV., and (2) On the
Eight Principal Faults, comprising Books V.–XII. So, too, with the
Conferences, and their three divisions: they are often found separately
in different <span class="sc"><span id="iv.i.ii-p9.3"></span>mss.</span>

<span id="iv.i.ii-p10"></span>The <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.ii-p10.1"></span>mss.</span> being so numerous, it was found
impossible to collate them all for the latest edition of Cassian’s
works; viz., that edited by Petschenig for the Vienna Corpus Scriptorum
Ecclesiasticorum Latinorum. The Editor therefore confined his attention
to a limited number, of which the following is the list.

<span id="iv.i.ii-p11"></span>I. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.ii-p11.1"></span>The</span> <span class="sc"><span

<span id="iv.i.ii-p12"></span>1. Codex Casinensis Rescriptus, 295. A
Palimpsest with the Epistles of S. Jerome written over Cassian’s work.
The date of this <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.ii-p12.1"></span>ms.</span> is the seventh or eighth century,
and it contains portions only of the Institutes, nothing remaining of
Books I.–IV., or of VIII. and IX.

<span id="iv.i.ii-p13"></span>2. Codex Majoris Seminarii Œduensis
(Autun), 24. Seventh century, containing portions of Books V.–XII.

<span id="iv.i.ii-p14"></span>3. Caroliruhensis, 87. Eighth century,

<span id="iv.i.ii-p23"></span>4. Parisinus, Bibl. Nat. nouv. fonds,

Conferences, being the only one of Petschenig’s <span class="sc"><span

<span id="iv.i.ii-p25"></span>6. Sangallensis, 574. Cent. 9–10.

<span id="iv.i.ii-p26"></span>Of these <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.ii-p26.1"></span>mss</span>. the last two contain many errors
and interpolations, some of which are followed in the editions of
Cassian published at Basle, 1485–1495.

contains Prosper’s work *Contra Collatorem*, the passages of Cassian
being written in the margin.

<span id="iv.i.ii-p38"></span>5. Caroliruhensis, 92. Ninth century.

<span id="iv.i.ii-p39"></span>6. Sangallensis, 575. Ninth century.

<span id="iv.i.ii-p40"></span>Passing now from the Institutes and
Conferences to the work “On the Incarnation against Nestorius,” we are
no longer encumbered by the number of <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.ii-p40.1"></span>mss.</span> There was not the same reason for
the multiplication of copies of it as there was in the case of those
writings which bore on the monastic life. It appears never to have
obtained any special popularity, and, so far as is known, only seven
<span class="sc"><span id="iv.i.ii-p40.2"></span>mss.</span> of it are
still in existence. The following are those of which Petschenig made use
for his edition:—

<span id="iv.i.ii-p41"></span>1. Codex Bibl. Armentarii Parisiensis
(Bibl. de l’Arsenal), 483. Cent. 10–11.

<span id="iv.i.ii-p42"></span>2. British Museum addl., 16414. Cent.
11–12.

<span id="iv.i.ii-p43"></span>3. Parisinus, Bibl. Nat., 14860.
Thirteenth century.

<span id="iv.i.ii-p44"></span>4. Bibl. Coloniensium Augustinianorum.
This <span class="sc"><span id="iv.i.ii-p44.1"></span>ms.</span> is now
lost, but was used by Cuyck for his edition of Cassian, and from this
Petschenig is able to give selected readings.

<span id="iv.i.ii-p45"></span>The remaining <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.ii-p45.1"></span>mss.</span> known to exist, but not used by
Petschenig, are these:—

<span id="iv.i.ii-p46"></span>1. Matritensis, Bibl. Nat., Q. 106.
Twelfth century.

<span id="iv.i.ii-p47"></span>2. Laurentianus (Laurentian Library at
Florence), XXVI., 13. Fifteenth century.

<span id="iv.i.ii-p48"></span>3. Bibl. Leop. Medici Fœsulanæ (also at
Florence), 48. Fifteenth century.

<span id="iv.i.ii-p49"></span>4. Parisinus, 2143. Fourteenth
century. <span id="fr_624"></span>[625](#fn_624.md)

<span id="iv.i.ii-p51"></span>It only remains to give some account of
the various editions of the printed text.

<span id="iv.i.ii-p52"></span>It has generally been stated that the
earliest edition of the Institutes was that printed at Venice in 1481,
of which only a single copy is known to exist, viz., in the Laurentian
Library at Florence; and that the first edition which included the
Conferences was that published by Amerbach at Basle in 1485. This
statement, however, appears to be erroneous, as there still exists in
the British Museum a single copy of a very early black-letter edition of
the Conferences. The title-page is gone, and there is no colophon; and,
therefore, the date cannot be given with certainty, but the work is
assigned by the authorities of the Museum to the year 1476, and is
thought to have proceeded from the press of the Brothers of the Common
life at Brussels. The first page of the work begins as follows: “Ut
Valeas cor in opere isto citius invenire qd requiris hæc tibi
concapitulatio breviter demostrabit quis unde in singulis collationibus
disputaverit.” Then follows a list of the twenty-four Conferences with
their authors, and the page ends with these words: “Prologus cassiani
sup. collationes patru ad leontiu et elladiu epos. In nomine Domini ihu
cristi dei nostri feliciter.”

<span id="iv.i.ii-p53"></span>This, then, in all probability was the
first edition of the Latin text of the Conferences. But it is a curious
fact that at a still earlier date a free German translation or
paraphrase of them had already been published. This, like the work just
mentioned, has been overlooked by all the editors of Cassian, but two
copies of it still remain in the British Museum, beginning as follow:
“Hic liber a quodam egregio sacrarum literarum professore magistro
Johane Nide ordis pdicatorum fratre de latino in vulgarem Nuremberge
translatus est.” The colophon <span id="page_196">p. 196</span> <span
id="iv.i.ii-Page_196"></span>in one copy gives the date as 1472, and the
place at which it was printed as Augsberg. The other copy has no date
but is assigned by the authorities of the Museum to a still earlier
year; viz., 1470.

<span id="iv.i.ii-p54"></span>The Basle edition of 1485 was reprinted at
the press of Amerbach in 1497; and at Venice there was issued a second
edition of the Institutes, to which the Conferences were added, in
1491. <span id="fr_625"></span>[626](#fn_625.md) Subsequent early editions
are those of Lyons, in 1516 and 1525, and Bologna 1521. But not till
1534 were the seven books on the Incarnation against Nestorius
published. They appear for the first time in the edition which was
issued in this year from the press of Cratander at Basle.

<span id="iv.i.ii-p56"></span>Far superior to all these early editions,
which were very faulty, was that published by Christopher Plantin at
Antwerp in 1578, edited by H. Cuyck, Professor at Louvain and afterward
Bishop of Ruremonde. It was undertaken at the suggestion of Cardinal
Carafa, and its full title is the following: “D. Ioannis Cassiani
Eremitæ Monasticarum Institutionum libri IIII. De Capitalibus vitiis
libri VIII. Collationes SS. Patrum XXIIII. De Verbi Incarnatione libri
VII. Nunc demum post varias editiones ad complurium <span
class="sc"><span id="iv.i.ii-p56.1"></span>ms.</span> fidem a non pancis
mendarum milibus incredibili labore expurgati: id quod ex subiectis ad
calcem castigationibus facile cognosci poterit: additis etiam ad quædam
loca censoriis notationibus, et obscurarum vocum ac sententiarun
elucidatione, un a cum duobus Indicibus locupletissimis. Accesserunt
quoque Regulæ SS. Patrum ex antiquissimo Affliginiensis monasterii <span
class="sc"><span id="iv.i.ii-p56.2"></span>ms.</span> codice desumptæ.
Opera et studio Henrici Cuyckii Sacræ Theologiæ Licentiati.”

<span id="iv.i.ii-p57"></span>Cuyck’s work was supplemented, also at
Carafa’s desire, by Petrus Ciacconius, a priest of Toledo, who died in
1581, before it was ready for the press. A new edition was, however,
published at Rome in 1588 “ex Edibus Dominicæ Basæ,” in which the notes
and emendations of Ciacconius were embodied. Unfortunately this edition
does not contain the books on the Incarnation. Its full title is as
follows: “Ioannis Cassiani Eremitæ de institutis renuntiantium Libri
XII. Collationes Sanctorum Patrum XXIIII. Adiectæ sunt quarundam
obscurarum dictionum interpretationes ordine alphabeti dispositæ: et
observationes in loca ambigua et minus tuta. Præterea Indices duo
testimoniorum sacræ Scripturæ, quæ a Cassiano vel explicantur, vel
aliter quam vulgata editio habet, citantur: ac postremo verum
memorabilium Index copiosissimus. Accedit Regula S. Pachomii, quæ a S.
Hieronymo in Latinum sermonem conversa est: Omnia multo quam antehac,
auxilio vetustissimorum codicum, emendatiora, et ad suam integritatem
restituta.” This edition, as well as the previous one, contained a
dissertation on a number of passages (some thirty in all) of doubtful
orthodoxy, in order to put the reader on his guard against following
Cassian in his errors.

<span id="iv.i.ii-p58"></span>In 1616 there was published at Douay in
two volumes what has remained until the present day the standard edition
of Cassian’s works, prepared with loving care by a Benedictine monk of
the Abbey of St. Vaast at Arras, named Gazet. This edition is enriched
throughout with copious annotations, containing an immense amount of
illustrative matter; and besides the text of Cassian’s works it contains
several other documents of importance for a right understanding of them.
The full title is this: “Ioannis Cassiani presbyteri, quem alii
eremitam, alii abbatem nuncupant, opera omnia. Novissime recognita,
repurgata et notis amplissimis illustrata. Quibus accessere alia ejusdem
argumenti opuscula, quorum elenchum sequens pagina exhibebit. Studio et
opera D. Alardi Gazæi cœnobitæ Vedastini ord. Benedicti.”

<span id="iv.i.ii-p59"></span>Besides the Institutes, Conferences, and
the work on the Incarnation against Nestorius, these volumes contained
the following among other material:—

<span id="iv.i.ii-p60"></span>The Rule of St. Pachomius.

<span id="iv.i.ii-p61"></span>The Catholic doctrine substituted for the
latter part of Conference XIII. by Dionysius Carthusianus.

<span id="iv.i.ii-p62"></span>Prosper “Contra Collatorem.”

<span id="iv.i.ii-p63"></span>This edition has been frequently
reprinted, <span id="fr_626"></span>[627](#fn_626.md) some of the later
reprints containing still more illustrative material. It still remains
indispensable to the student of Cassian’s works by reason of the
valuable commentary with which it is throughout enriched. But for the
mere *text* it is now altogether superseded by the fine edition prepared
by Petschenig for the Vienna Corpus Scriptorum Ecclesiasticorum
Latinorum, in two volumes.

<span id="iv.i.ii-p65"></span>Vol. I.—Ioannis Cassiani De Institutis
Cœnobiorum et de octo Principalium Vitiorum Remediis Libri XII. De
Incarnatione Domini Contra Nestorium Libri VII. recensuit et commentario
critico instruxit Michæl Petschenig. Accedunt Prolegomena et Indices
(Vindobonæ, 1888).

<span id="page_197">p. 197</span> <span id="iv.i.ii-Page_197"></span>

<span id="iv.i.ii-p66"></span>Vol. II.—Ioannis Cassiani Conlationes
XXIIII. (Vindobonæ, 1886). Petschenig’s work is admirably done, and the
text of this edition is vastly superior to that of all its predecessors.
In the present translation it has been used throughout the Conferences.
The volume containing the Institutes and the work on the Incarnation
unfortunately appeared too late for the translation to be made from it.
It has, however, been carefully compared with the text of Ciacconius,
which Gazet merely repeats, <span id="fr_627"></span>[628](#fn_627.md) and
attention is called to the chief variations in the notes.

<span id="iv.i.ii-p68"></span>Mention has already been made of the early
German paraphrase or translation, dating from 1470 or 1472; and the
popularity of the Cassian’s works is evinced by the number of other
early translations made into the various languages of Europe. Of these
next in order of time is one in Flemish. In the copy of this in the
British Museum the title is wanting, the book beginning as follows:
“Hier beghint der ouder vader collacie. Hi hyetede Ioannes Cassianus die
dese vieretwintich navolgende vad, collacien ghemaect hevet.” The
colophon is this: “Hier eyndet een seer goede en profitelike leeringhe.
En is ghenoemt der ouder vaders collacien. Michiel hiller van
Hoochstraten. Tantwerpen 1506. fol.”

<span id="iv.i.ii-p69"></span>Very little later is the first of several
French translations, with the following curious title: “Les Collacions
des sains Peres anciens translateez de Grec en latin. Par Cassiodorus
tres sainct docteur en theologie et translateez de latin en francoys par
maistre ieha gosein aussy docteur en theologie de l’ordre des freres de
la Montaigne du carme et imprimees nouvellement a paris.” No date is
given, but the work is assigned by the Museum authorities to the year
1510.

<span id="iv.i.ii-p70"></span>Later French translations are the
following:—

<span id="iv.i.ii-p71"></span>Paris. Chez Charles Savreux. 8° les
Conférences de Cassien traduites en françois par De Saligny. 1663. (This
edition altogether omits the thirteenth Conference.)

<span id="iv.i.ii-p72"></span>Paris. Chez Charles Savreux. 8° les
Institutions de Cassien traduites en françois par De Saligny. 1667.

<span id="iv.i.ii-p73"></span>Institutions de Cassien traduites par E.
Cartier. Paris, Tours, 1872.

<span id="iv.i.ii-p74"></span>There are also two Italian translations,
one as early as 1563 (Opera. Tradotta per B. Buffi. Venetia. 1563. 4°),
and one of the present century,—Volgarizzamento delle collazioni dei SS.
Padri del venerabile G. C. \[By Bartolommeo da San Concordio?\] Testo di
lingua in edito \[edited by T. Bini\]. Lucca. 1854. 8°.

<span id="iv.i.ii-p75"></span>It is remarkable that England has till now
stood almost alone in possessing no translation, Cassian’s works having
never yet appeared in an English press. It is hoped that the version now
offered to the reader may do something to make the works of this
interesting and most instructive writer more widely known than they
appear to be at present.
