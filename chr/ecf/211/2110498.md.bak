#### <span id="iv.iii.x.xiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIII.

<span id="iv.iii.x.xiii-p1"></span>Of his saying: “We have heard that
some among you walk disorderly.”

<span id="iv.iii.x.xiii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.x.xiii-p2.1"></span>Then</span> after all this rigour of
gospel severity, he now lays bare the reason why he put forward all
these matters. “For we have heard that some among you walk disorderly,
working not at all, but curiously meddling.” He is nowhere satisfied to
speak of those who will not give themselves up to work, as if they were
victims of but a single malady. For in his first Epistle <span
id="fr_976"></span>[977](#fn_976.md) he speaks of them as “disorderly,” and
not walking according to the traditions which they had received from
him: and he also asserts that they were restless, and ate their bread
for nought. Again he says here, “We have heard that there are some among
you who walk disorderly.” And at once he subjoins a second weakness,
which is the root of this restlessness, and says, “working not at all;”
a third malady as well he adds, which springs from this last like some
shoot: “but curiously meddling.”
