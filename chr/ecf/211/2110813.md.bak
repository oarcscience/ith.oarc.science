#### <span id="iv.iv.xi.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.

<span id="iv.iv.xi.vi-p1"></span>Of the reasons why Jesus Christ appears
to each one of us either in His humility or in His glorified condition.

<span id="iv.iv.xi.vi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.xi.vi-p2.1"></span>For</span> according to the measure of its
purity, as I said in the former Conference, each mind is both raised and
moulded in its prayers if it forsakes the consideration of earthly and
material things so far as the condition of its purity may carry it
forward, and enable it with the inner eyes of the soul to see Jesus
either still in His humility and in the flesh, or glorified and coming
in the glory of His Majesty: for those cannot see Jesus coming in His
Kingdom who are still kept back in a sort of state of Jewish weakness,
and cannot say with the Apostle: “And if we have known Christ after the
flesh, yet now we know Him so no more;” <span
id="fr_1667"></span>[1668](#fn_1667.md) but only those can look with purest
eyes on His Godhead, who rise with Him from low and earthly works and
thoughts and go apart in the lofty mountain of solitude which is free
from the disturbance of all earthly thoughts and troubles, and secure
from the interference of all sins, and being exalted by pure faith and
the heights of virtue reveals the glory of His Face and the image of His
splendour to those who are able to look on Him with pure eyes of the
soul. But Jesus is seen as well by those who live in towns and villages
and hamlets, i.e., who are occupied in practical affairs and works, but
not with the same brightness with which He appeared to those who can go
up with Him into the aforesaid mount of virtues, i.e., Peter, James, and
John. For so in solitude He appeared to Moses and spoke with Elias. And
as our Lord wished to establish this and to leave us examples of perfect
purity, although He Himself, the very fount of inviolable sanctity, had
no need of external help and the assistance of solitude in order to
secure it (for the fulness of purity could not be soiled by any stain
from crowds, nor could He be contaminated by intercourse with men, who
cleanses and sanctifies all things that are polluted) yet still He
retired into the mountain alone to pray, thus teaching us by the example
of His retirement that if we too wish to approach God with a pure and
spotless affection of heart, we should also retire from all the
disturbance and confusion of crowds, so that while still living in the
body we may manage in some degree to adapt ourselves to some likeness of
that bliss which is promised hereafter to the saints, and that “God may
be” to us “all in all.” <span id="fr_1668"></span>[1669](#fn_1668.md)
