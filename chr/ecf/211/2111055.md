#### <span id="iv.vi.vii.xvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVII.

<span id="iv.vi.vii.xvii-p1"></span>How all the saints have confessed
with truth that they were unclean and sinful.

<span id="iv.vi.vii.xvii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.vii.xvii-p2.1"></span>And</span> therefore with daily sighs
all the saints grieve over this weakness of their nature and while they
search into their shifting thoughts and the secrets and inmost recesses
of their conscience, cry out in entreaty: “Enter not into judgment with
Thy servant, for in Thy sight shall no man living be justified;” and
this: “Who will boast that he hath a chaste heart? or who will have
confidence that he is pure from sin?” and again: “There is not a
righteous man upon earth that doeth good and sinneth not;” and this
also: “Who knoweth his faults?” <span
id="fr_2281"></span>[2282](#fn_2281) And so they have recognized that
man’s righteousness is weak and imperfect and always needs God’s mercy,
so that one of those whose iniquities and sins God purged away with the
live coal of His word sent from the altar, after that marvellous vision
of God, after his view of the Seraphim on high and the revelation of
heavenly mysteries, said: “Woe is me! for I am a man of unclean lips,
and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips.” <span
id="fr_2282"></span>[2283](#fn_2282) And I fancy that perhaps even then
he would not have felt the uncleanness of his lips, unless it had been
given him to recognize the true and complete purity of perfection by the
vision of God, at the sight of Whom he suddenly became aware of his own
uncleanness, of which he had previously been ignorant. For when he says:
“Woe is me! for I am a man of unclean lips,” he shows that his
confession that follows refers to his own lips, and not to the
uncleanness of the people: “and I dwell in the midst of a people of
unclean lips.” But even when in his prayer he confesses the uncleanness
of all sinners, he embraces in his general supplication not only the
mass of the wicked but also of the good, saying: “Behold Thou art angry,
and we have sinned: in them we have been always, and we shall be saved.
We are all become as one unclean, and all our righteousnesses as filthy
rags.” <span id="fr_2283"></span>[2284](#fn_2283) What, I ask, could be
clearer than this saying, in which the prophet includes not one only but
all our righteousnesses and, looking round on all things that are
considered unclean and disgusting, because he could find nothing in the
life of men fouler or more unclean, chose to compare them to filthy
rags. In vain then is the sharpness of a nagging objection raised
against this perfectly clear truth, as a little while back you said: “If
no one is without sin, then no one is holy; and if no one is holy, then
no one will be saved.” <span id="fr_2284"></span>[2285](#fn_2284) For
the puzzle of this question can be solved by the prophet’s testimony.
“Behold,” he says, “Thou art angry and we have sinned,” i.e., when Thou
didst reject our pride of heart or our carelessness, and deprive us of
Thine aid, at once the abyss of our sins swallowed us up, as if one
should say to the bright substance of the sun: Behold thou hast set, and
at once murky darkness covered us. And yet though he here says that the
saints have sinned, and have not only sinned but also have always
remained in their sins, he does not altogether despair of salvation but
adds: “In them we have been always, and we shall be saved.” This saying:
“Behold Thou art angry and we have sinned,” I will compare to that one
of the Apostle’s: “O wretched man that I am! Who shall deliver me from
the body of this death?” Again this that the prophet subjoins: “In them
we have been always, and we shall be saved,” corresponds to the
following words of the Apostle: “Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ
our Lord.” In the same way also this passage of the same prophet: “Woe
is me! for I am a man of unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of a
people of <span id="page_530">p. 530</span> <span
id="iv.vi.vii.xvii-Page_530"></span>unclean lips,” seems to agree with
the words quoted above: “O wretched man that I am! Who shall deliver me
from the body of this death?” And what follows in the prophet. “And
behold there flew to me one of the Seraphim, having in his hand a coal
(or stone) which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar. And he
touched my mouth and said: Lo, with this I have touched thy lips, and
thine iniquity is taken away and thy sin is purged,” <span
id="fr_2285"></span>[2286](#fn_2285) is just what seems to have fallen
from the mouth of Paul, who says: “Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ
our Lord.” You see then how all the saints with truth confess not so
much in the person of the people as in their own that they are sinners,
and yet by no means despair of their salvation, but look for full
justification (which they do not hope that they cannot obtain by virtue
of the state of human frailty) from the grace and mercy of the Lord.
