#### <span id="iv.iii.xii.xvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVII.

<span id="iv.iii.xii.xvii-p1"></span>Various passages which clearly show
that we cannot do anything which belongs to our salvation without the
aid of God.

<span id="iv.iii.xii.xvii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.xii.xvii-p2.1"></span>Lastly</span>, the Author of our
salvation teaches us what we ought not merely to think, but also to
acknowledge in everything that we do. “I can,” He says, “of mine own
self do nothing, but the Father which abideth in me, He doeth the
works.” <span id="fr_1056"></span>[1057](#fn_1056.md) He says, speaking in
the human nature which He had taken, <span
id="fr_1057"></span>[1058](#fn_1057.md) that He could do nothing of
Himself; and shall we, who are dust and ashes, think that we have no
need of God’s help in what pertains to our salvation? And so let us
learn in everything, as we feel our own weakness, and at the same time
His help, to declare with the saints, “I was overturned that I might
fall, but the Lord supported me. The Lord is my strength and my praise:
and He is become my salvation.” <span
id="fr_1058"></span>[1059](#fn_1058.md) And “Unless the Lord had helped me,
my <span id="page_285">p. 285</span> <span
id="iv.iii.xii.xvii-Page_285"></span>soul had almost dwelt in hell. If I
said, My foot is moved: Thy mercy, O Lord, assisted me. According to the
multitude of my sorrows in my heart, Thy comforts have given joy to my
soul.” <span id="fr_1059"></span>[1060](#fn_1059.md) Seeing also that our
heart is strengthened in the fear of the Lord, and in patience, let us
say: “And the Lord became my protector; and He brought me forth into a
large place.” <span id="fr_1060"></span>[1061](#fn_1060.md) And knowing
that knowledge is increased by progress in work, let us say: “For thou
lightest my lamp, O Lord: O my God, enlighten my darkness, for by Thee I
shall be delivered from temptation, and through my God I shall go over a
wall.” Then, feeling that we have ourselves sought for courage and
endurance, and are being directed with greater ease and without labour
in the path of the virtues, let us say, “It is God who girded me with
strength, and made my way perfect; who made my feet like hart’s feet,
and setteth me up on high: who teacheth my hands to war.” And having
also secured discretion, strengthened with which we can dash down our
enemies, let us cry aloud to God: “Thy discipline hath set me up <span
id="fr_1061"></span>[1062](#fn_1061.md) unto the end, and Thy discipline
the same shall teach me. Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, and my
feet are not weakened.” And because I am thus strengthened with Thy
knowledge and power, I will boldly take up the words which follow, and
will say, “I will pursue after my enemies and overtake them: and I will
not turn again till they are consumed. I will break them, and they shall
not be able to stand: they shall fall under my feet.” <span
id="fr_1062"></span>[1063](#fn_1062.md) Again, mindful of our own
infirmity, and of the fact that while still burdened with the weak flesh
we cannot without His assistance overcome such bitter foes as our sins
are, let us say, “Through Thee we will scatter our enemies: <span
id="fr_1063"></span>[1064](#fn_1063.md) and through Thy name we will
despise them that rise up against us. For I will not trust in my bow:
neither shall my sword save me. For Thou hast saved us from them that
afflict us: and hast put them to shame that hate us.” <span
id="fr_1064"></span>[1065](#fn_1064.md) But further: “Thou hast guided me
with strength unto the battle, and hast subdued under me them that rose
up against me. And Thou hast made mine enemies turn their backs upon me,
and hast destroyed them that hated me.” <span
id="fr_1065"></span>[1066](#fn_1065.md) And reflecting that with our own
arms alone we cannot conquer, let us say, “Take hold of arms and shield:
and rise up to help me. Bring out the sword and stop the way against
them that persecute me: say to my soul, I am thy salvation.” <span
id="fr_1066"></span>[1067](#fn_1066.md) And Thou hast made my arms like a
brazen bow. And Thou hast given me the protection of Thy salvation: and
Thy right hand hath held me up.” <span
id="fr_1067"></span>[1068](#fn_1067.md) “For our fathers got not the
possession of the land through their own sword; neither did their own
arm save them: but Thy right hand and Thine arm and the light of Thy
countenance because Thou wast pleased with them.” <span
id="fr_1068"></span>[1069](#fn_1068.md) Lastly, as with anxious mind we
regard all His benefits with thankfulness, let us cry to Him with the
inmost feelings of our heart, for all these things, because we have
fought, and have obtained from Him the light of knowledge, and
self-control and discretion, and because He has furnished us with His
own arms, and strengthened us with a girdle of virtue, and because He
has made our enemies turn their backs upon us, and has given us the
power of scattering them like the dust before the wind: “I will love
Thee, O Lord my Strength; the Lord is my stronghold, my refuge and my
deliverer. My God is my helper, and in Him will I put my trust. My
protector and the horn of my salvation, and my support. Praising I will
call upon the name of the Lord; and I shall be saved from mine
enemies.” <span id="fr_1069"></span>[1070](#fn_1069.md)
