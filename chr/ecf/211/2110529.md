<span id="iv.iii.xi.xviii-p1"></span>How a monk ought to avoid women and
bishops.

<span id="iv.iii.xi.xviii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.xi.xviii-p2.1"></span>Wherefore</span> this is an old maxim
of the Fathers that is still current,—though I cannot produce it without
shame on my own part, since I could not avoid my own sister, nor escape
the hands of the bishop,—viz., that a monk ought by all means to fly
from women and bishops. For neither of them will allow him who has once
been joined in close intercourse any longer to care for the quiet of his
cell, or to continue with pure eyes in divine contemplation through his
insight into holy things.
