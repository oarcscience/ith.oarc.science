<span id="iv.iii.i.x-p3"></span>Of the modification in the observances
which may be permitted in accordance with the character of the climate
or the custom of the district.

<span id="iv.iii.i.x-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.i.x-p4.1"></span>So</span> much may be said, that we may not
appear to have left out any article of the dress of the Egyptians. But
we need only keep to those which the situation of the place and the
customs of the district permit. For the severity of the winter does not
allow us to be satisfied with slippers <span
id="fr_665"></span>[666](#fn_665) or tunics or a single frock; and the
covering of tiny hoods or the wearing of a sheepskin would afford a
subject for derision instead of edifying the spectators. Wherefore we
hold that we ought to introduce only those things which we have
described above, and which are adapted to the humble character of our
profession and the nature of the climate, that the chief thing about our
dress may be not the novelty of the garb, which might give some offence
to men of the world, but its honourable simplicity.
