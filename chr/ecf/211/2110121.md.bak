#### <span id="ii.v.ii.xiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIII.

<span id="ii.v.ii.xiii-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.ii.xiii-p1.1"></span>But</span> perhaps you say, “Why did not
the Apostles enjoin these things on virgins?” Because they did not think
that necessary, lest such an exhortation, if given to them, might rather
seem an insult than a means of edification. Nor, in fact, would they
have believed that virgins could ever proceed to such an extreme of
hardihood, as to claim for themselves carnal and worldly ornaments, not
permitted even to married women. Undoubtedly, the virgin ought to adorn
and array herself; for how can she be able to please her betrothed, if
she does not come forth in a neat and ornamental form? Let her be
adorned by all means, but let her ornaments be of an internal and
spiritual kind, and not of a carnal nature; for God desires in her a
beauty not of the body, but of the soul. Do thou, therefore, who
desirest that thy soul <span id="page_65">p. 65</span> <span
id="ii.v.ii.xiii-Page_65"></span>should be loved and dwelt in by God,
array it with all diligence, and adorn it with spiritual garments. Let
nothing unbecoming, nothing repulsive, be seen in it. Let it shine with
the gold of righteousness, and gleam with the gems of holiness, and
glitter with the most precious pearl of purity; instead of fine linen
and silk, let it be arrayed in the robe of mercifulness and piety,
according to what is written, “Put ye <span
id="fr_211"></span>[212](#fn_211.md) on, therefore, as the elect of God,
holy and beloved bowels of mercy, kindness, humility,” and so forth. And
let the virgin not ask for the beauty due to ceruse, <span
id="fr_212"></span>[213](#fn_212.md) or any other pigment, but let her have
the brightness of innocence and simplicity, the rosy hue of modesty, and
the purple glow of honorable shamefacedness. Let her be washed with the
nitre of heavenly doctrine, and purified by all spiritual
lavements. <span id="fr_213"></span>[214](#fn_213.md) Let no stain of
malice or sin be left in her. And lest, at any time, she should give
forth the evil odor of sin, let her be imbued, through and through, with
the most pleasant ointment of wisdom and knowledge.
