#### <span id="iv.iv.vi.xxvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXVII.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.xxvii-p1"></span>That our battles are not fought with
our faults in the same order as that in which they stand in the list.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.xxvii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.vi.xxvii-p2.1"></span>But</span> you must know that our
battles are not all fought in the same order, because, as we mentioned
that the attacks are not always made on us in the same way, each one of
us ought also to begin the battle with due regard to the character of
the attack which is especially made on him so that one man will have to
fight his first battle against the fault which stands third on the list,
another against that which is fourth or fifth. And in proportion as
faults hold sway over us, and the character of their attack may demand,
so we too ought to regulate the order of our conflict, in such a way
that the happy result of a victory and triumph succeeding may insure our
attainment of purity of heart and complete perfection.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.xxvii-p3"></span>Thus far did Abbot Serapion
discourse to us of the nature of the eight principal faults, and so
clearly did he expound the different sorts of passions which are latent
within us—the origin and connexion of which, though we were daily
tormented by them, we could never before thoroughly understand and
perceive—that we seemed almost to see them spread out before our eyes as
in a mirror.
