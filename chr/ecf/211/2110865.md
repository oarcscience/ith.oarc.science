#### <span id="iv.v.v.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.

<span id="iv.v.v.v-p1"></span>On perseverance in the line that has been
chosen.

<span id="iv.v.v.v-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.v.v-p2.1"></span>Wherefore</span> it is good and profitable for
each one to endeavour with all his might and main to attain perfection
in the work that has been begun, according to the line which he has
chosen as the grace which he has received; and while he praises and
admires the virtues of others, not to swerve from his own line which he
has once for all chosen, as he knows that, as the Apostle says, the body
of the Church indeed is one, but the members many, and that it has
“gifts differing according to the grace which is given us, whether
prophecy, according to the proportion of the faith, whether ministry, in
ministering, or he that teacheth, in doctrine, or he that exhorteth in
exhortation, he that giveth, in simplicity, he that ruleth, with
carefulness, he that showeth mercy, with cheerfulness.” <span
id="fr_1869"></span>[1870](#fn_1869.md) For no members can claim the
offices of other members, because the eyes cannot perform the duties of
the hands, nor the nostrils of the ears. And so not all are Apostles,
not all prophets, not all doctors, not all have the gifts of healing,
not all speak with tongues, not all interpret. <span
