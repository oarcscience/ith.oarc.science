#### <span id="ii.vi.ii.xxvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXVI.

<span id="ii.vi.ii.xxvi-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.vi.ii.xxvi-p1.1"></span>Well</span>, then, after Jonathan, his
brother Simon, as has been said above, ruled over the Hebrews with the
power of high-priest. For that honor was then bestowed upon him both by
his own countrymen and by the Roman people. He began to rule over his
countrymen in the second year of king Demetrius, but eight years
afterwards, being deceived by a plot of Ptolemy, he met his death. He
was succeeded by his son John. And he, on the ground that he had fought
with distinction against the Hyrcani, a very powerful nation, received
the surname of Hyrcanus. He died, after having held the supreme power
for twenty-six years. After him, Aristobulus being appointed
high-priest, was the first of all living after the captivity to assume
the name of king, and to have a crown placed upon his head. At the close
of a year, he died. Then Alexander, his son, who was both king and
high-priest, reigned twenty-seven years; but I have found nothing in his
doings worthy of mention, except his cruelty. He having left two young
sons named Aristobulus and Hyrcanus, Salina or Alexandra, his wife, held
the sovereignty for three years. After his decease, frightful conflicts
about the supreme power arose between the two brothers. And first of
all, Hyrcanus held the government; but being by and by defeated by his
brother Aristobulus, he <span id="page_110">p. 110</span> <span
id="ii.vi.ii.xxvi-Page_110"></span>fled to Pompey. That Roman general,
having finished the war with Mithridates, and settled Armenia and
Pontus, being, in fact, the conqueror of all the nations which he had
visited, desired to march inwards, <span
id="fr_350"></span>[351](#fn_350) and to add all the neighboring regions
to the Roman empire. He therefore inquired into the causes of the war,
and the means of obtaining <span id="fr_351"></span>[352](#fn_351) the
mastery. Accordingly he readily received Hyrcanus, and, under his
guidance, attacked the Jews; but when the city was taken and destroyed,
he spared the temple. He sent Aristobulus in chains to Rome, and
restored the right of the high-priesthood to Hyrcanus. Settling the
tribute to be paid by the Jews, he placed over them as governor a
certain Antipater of Askelon. Hyrcanus held the chief power for
thirty-four years; but while he carried on war against the Parthians, he
was taken prisoner.
