#### <span id="ii.iv.i.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.

<span id="ii.iv.i.v-p1"></span>“<span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.i.v-p1.1"></span>Assuredly</span>,” continues Postumianus, “I
shall take care in future not to mention the abstinence of any one, in
case the difficult example should quite offend our friends the Gauls. I
had intended, however, to give an account also of the dinner of that man
of Cyrene—for we were seven days with him—or some of the subsequent
feasts; but these things had better be passed over, lest the Gaul should
think that he was jeered at. However, on the following day, when some of
the natives had come together to visit us, we discovered that that host
of ours was a Presbyter—a fact which he had concealed from us with the
greatest care. We then went with him to the church, which was about two
miles distant, and was concealed from our view by an intervening
mountain. We found that it was constructed of common and worthless
trees, and was not much more imposing than the hut of our host, in which
one could not stand without stooping. On enquiring into the customs of
the men of the district, we found that they were not in the habit of
either buying or selling anything. They knew not the meaning of either
fraud or theft. As to gold and silver, which mankind generally deem the
most desirable of all things, they neither possess them, nor do they
desire to possess them. For when I offered that Presbyter ten gold
coins, he refused them, declaring, with profound wisdom, that the church
was not benefited but rather <span id="fr_92"></span>[93](#fn_92)
injured by gold. We presented him, however, with some pieces of
clothing.
