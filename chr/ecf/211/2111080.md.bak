#### <span id="iv.vi.viii.xx-p0.1"></span>Chapter XX.

<span id="iv.vi.viii.xx-p1"></span>How useful is relaxation on the
arrival of brethren.

<span id="iv.vi.viii.xx-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.viii.xx-p2.1"></span>That</span> most refreshing interlude
also of relaxation and courtesy, which sometimes is wont to intervene
because of the arrival of brethren, although it may seem to us tiresome
and what we ought to avoid, yet how useful it is and good for our bodies
as well as our souls you must patiently hear in few words. It often
happens I say not to novices and weak persons but even to those of the
greatest experience and perfection, that unless the strain and tension
of their mind is lessened by the relaxation of some changes, they fall
either into coldness of spirit; or at any rate into a most dangerous
state of bodily health. And therefore when there occur even frequent
visits from the brethren they should not only be patiently put up with,
but even gratefully welcomed by those who are wise and perfect; first
because they stimulate us always to desire with greater eagerness the
retirement of the desert (for somehow while they are thought to impede
our progress, they really maintain it unwearied and unbroken, and if it
was never hindered by any obstacles, it would not endure to the end with
unswerving perseverance), next because they give us the opportunity of
refreshing the body, together with the advantages of kindness, and at
the same time with a most delightful relaxation of the body confer on us
greater advantage than those which we should have gained by the
weariness which results from abstinence. On which matter I will briefly
give a most apt illustration handed down in an old story.
