#### <span id="iv.vii.viii.xxvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXVII.

<span id="iv.vii.viii.xxvii-p1"></span>To the foregoing he adds Rufinus
and the blessed Augustine.

<span id="iv.vii.viii.xxvii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.viii.xxvii-p2.1"></span>Rufinus</span> also, a Christian
philosopher, with no mean place among Ecclesiastical Doctors testifies
as follows of the Lord’s Nativity in his Exposition of the Creed. “For
the Son of God,” he says, “is born of a Virgin, not chiefly allied to
the flesh alone, but generated in the soul which is the medium between
the flesh and God.” <span id="fr_2671"></span>[2672](#fn_2671) Does he
witness obscurely that God was born of man? Augustine the priest <span
id="fr_2672"></span>[2673](#fn_2672) of Hippo Regiensis says: “That men
might be born of God, God was first born of them: for Christ is God. And
Christ when born of men only required a mother on earth, because He
always had a Father in heaven, being born of God through whom we are
made, and also born of a woman, through whom we might be
re-created.” <span id="fr_2673"></span>[2674](#fn_2673) Again, in this
place: “And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us. Why then need
you wonder that men are born of God? Notice how God Himself was born of
men.” Again in his Epistle to Volusianus: “But Moses himself and the
rest of the prophets most truly prophesied of Christ the Lord, and gave
Him great glory: they declared that He would come not as one like
themselves, nor merely greater in the same sort of power of working
miracles, but clearly as the Lord God of all, and as made man for men.
Who therefore Himself also willed to do such things as they <span
id="page_619">p. 619</span> <span
id="iv.vii.viii.xxvii-Page_619"></span>did to prevent the absurdity of
His not doing Himself those things which He did through them. But still
it was right also for Him to do something special; viz., to be born of a
Virgin, to rise from the dead, to ascend into heaven. And if anyone
thinks that this is too little for God, I know not what more he can look
for. <span id="fr_2674"></span>[2675](#fn_2674)
