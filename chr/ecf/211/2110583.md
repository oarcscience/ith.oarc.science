#### <span id="iv.iv.ii.xvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVI.

<span id="iv.iv.ii.xvi-p1"></span>A question on the changing character
of the thoughts.

<span id="iv.iv.ii.xvi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.ii.xvi-p2.1"></span>Germanus</span>. How is it then, that even
against our will, aye and without our knowledge idle thoughts steal upon
us so subtilely and secretly that it is fearfully hard not merely to
drive them away, but even to grasp and seize them? Can then a mind
sometimes be found free from them, and never attacked by illusions of
this kind?
