<span id="iv.iv.vii.iii"></span>

#### <span id="iv.iv.vii.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.iii-p1"></span>Of the three kinds of things there
are in the world; viz., good, bad, and indifferent.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.iii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.vii.iii-p2.1"></span>Altogether</span> there are three kinds
of things in the world; viz., good, bad, and indifferent. And so we
ought to know what is properly good, and what is bad, and what is
indifferent, that our faith may be supported by true knowledge and stand
firm in all temptations. We must then believe that in things which <span
id="page_353">p. 353</span> <span id="iv.iv.vii.iii-Page_353"></span>are
merely human there is no real good except virtue of soul alone, which
leads us with unfeigned faith to things divine, and makes us constantly
adhere to that unchanging good. And on the other hand we ought not to
call anything bad, except sin alone, which separates us from the good
God, and unites us to the evil devil. But those things are indifferent
which can be appropriated to either side according to the fancy or wish
of their owner, as for instance riches, power, honour, bodily strength,
good health, beauty, life itself, and death, poverty, bodily
infirmities, injuries, and other things of the same sort, which can
contribute either to good or to evil as the character and fancy of their
owner directs. For riches are often serviceable for our good, as the
Apostle says, who charges “the rich of this world to be ready to give,
to distribute to the needy, to lay up in store for themselves a good
foundation against the time to come, that” by this means “they may lay
hold on the true life.” <span id="fr_1370"></span>[1371](#fn_1370) And
according to the gospel they are a good thing for those who “make to
themselves friends of the unrighteous mammon.” <span
id="fr_1371"></span>[1372](#fn_1371) And again, they can be drawn in the
direction of what is bad when they are amassed only for the sake of
hoarding them or for a life of luxury, and are not employed to meet the
wants of the poor. And that power also and honour and bodily strength
and good health are indifferent and available for either (good or bad)
can easily be shown from the fact that many of the Old Testament saints
enjoyed all these things and were in positions of great wealth and the
highest honour, and blessed with bodily strength, and yet are known to
have been most acceptable to God. And on the contrary those who have
wrongfully abused these things and perverted them for their own purposes
are not without good reason punished or destroyed, as the Book of Kings
shows us has often happened. And that even life and death are in
themselves indifferent the birth of S. John and of Judas proves. For in
the case of the one his life was so profitable to himself that we are
told that his birth brought joy to others also, as we read “And many
shall rejoice at his birth;” <span id="fr_1372"></span>[1373](#fn_1372)
but of the life of the other it is said: “It were good for that man if
he had never been born.” <span id="fr_1373"></span>[1374](#fn_1373)
Further it is said of the death of John and of all saints “Right dear in
the sight of the Lord is the death of His saints:” <span
id="fr_1374"></span>[1375](#fn_1374) but of that of Judas and men like
him “The death of the wicked is very evil.” <span
id="fr_1375"></span>[1376](#fn_1375) And how useful bodily sickness
sometimes may be the blessing on Lazarus, the beggar who was full of
sores, shows us. For Scripture makes mention of no other good qualities
or deserts of his, but it was for this fact alone; viz., that he endured
want and bodily sickness with the utmost patience, that he was deemed
worthy of the blessed lot of a place in Abraham’s bosom. <span
id="fr_1376"></span>[1377](#fn_1376) And with regard to want and
persecution and injuries which everybody thinks to be bad, how useful
and necessary they are is clearly proved by this fact; viz., that the
saints not only never tried to avoid them, but actually either sought
them with all their powers or bravely endured them, and thus became the
friends of God, and obtained the reward of eternal life, as the blessed
Apostle chants: “For which cause I delight myself in my infirmities, in
reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ.
For when I am weak, then I am strong, for power is made perfect in
infirmity.” <span id="fr_1377"></span>[1378](#fn_1377) And therefore
those who are exalted with the greatest riches and honours and powers of
this world, should not be deemed to have secured their chief good out of
them (for this is shown to consist only in virtue) but only something
indifferent, because just as to good men who use them well and properly
they will be found to be useful and convenient (for they afford them
opportunities for good works and fruits which shall endure to eternal
life), so to those who wrongfully abuse their wealth, they are useless
and out of place, and furnish occasions of sin and death.
