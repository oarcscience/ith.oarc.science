#### <span id="iv.iii.xii.xix-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIX.

<span id="iv.iii.xii.xix-p1"></span>How this faith concerning the grace
of God was delivered to us by the ancient Fathers.

<span id="iv.iii.xii.xix-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.xii.xix-p2.1"></span>This</span> then is that humility
towards God, this is that genuine faith of the ancient fathers which
still remains intact among their successors. And to this faith, the
apostolic virtues, which they so often showed, bear an undoubted
witness, not only among us but also among infidels and unbelievers: for
keeping in simplicity of heart the simple faith of the fishermen they
did not receive it in a worldly spirit through dialectical syllogisms or
the eloquence of a Cicero, but learnt by the experience of a pure life,
and stainless actions, and by correcting their faults, and (to speak
more truly) by visible proofs, that the character of perfection is to be
found in that faith without which neither piety towards God, nor
purification from sin, nor amendment of life, nor perfection of virtue
can be secured.
