<span id="ii.v.ii.iii-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.ii.iii-p1.1"></span>But</span> that the merit of virginity may
shine forth more clearly, and that there may be a better understanding
as to how worthy it is of God, let this be considered, that the Lord
God, our Saviour, when, for the salvation of the human race, he
condescended to assume mankind, chose no other than a virgin’s womb,
that he might show how virtue of this kind especially pleased him; and
that he might point out the blessedness of chastity to both sexes, he
had a virgin mother, while he himself was ever to remain in a like
condition. He thus furnished in his own person to men, and in the person
of his mother to women, an example of virginity, by which it might be
proved, with respect to both sexes, that the blessed state of purity
possessed the <span id="page_59">p. 59</span> <span
id="ii.v.ii.iii-Page_59"></span>fullness of divinity, <span
id="fr_169"></span>[170](#fn_169) for whatever dwelt in the Son was also
wholly in the mother. But why should I take pains to make known the
excellent and surpassing merit of chastity, and to set forth the
glorious good of virginity, when I am not ignorant that many have
discoursed on this subject, and have proved its blessedness by most
conclusive reasons, and since it can never be a matter of doubt to any
reflecting mind, that a thing has all the more merit, the more difficult
it is of accomplishment? For if any one judges chastity to be of no
moment or only of small consequence, it is certain that he is either
ignorant of the matter, or is not willing to incur the trouble it
implies. Hence it comes to pass that those always derogate from the
importance of chastity, who either do not possess it, or who are
unwillingly compelled to maintain it.
