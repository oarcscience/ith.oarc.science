#### <span id="iv.v.ii.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.

<span id="iv.v.ii.ix-p1"></span>That love not only makes sons out of
servants, but also bestows the image and likeness of God.

<span id="iv.v.ii.ix-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.ii.ix-p2.1"></span>And</span> if to anyone relying on the help
of God and not on his own efforts, it has been vouchsafed to acquire
this state, from the condition of a servant, wherein is fear, and from a
mercenary greed of hope, whereby there is sought not so much the good of
the donor as the recompense of reward, he will begin to pass on to the
adoption of sons, where there is no longer fear, nor greed, but that
love which never faileth continually endures. Of which fear and love the
Lord in chiding some shows what is befitting for each one: “A son
knoweth his own father, and a servant feareth his lord: And if I be a
Father, where is My honour: and if I be a Lord, where is my fear?” <span
id="fr_1702"></span>[1703](#fn_1702) For one who is a servant must needs
fear because “if knowing his lord’s will he has done things worthy of
stripes, he shall be beaten with many stripes.” <span
id="fr_1703"></span>[1704](#fn_1703) Whoever then by this love has
attained the image and likeness of God, will now delight in goodness for
the pleasure of goodness itself, and having somehow a like feeling of
patience and gentleness will henceforth be angered by no faults of
sinners, but in his compassion and sympathy will rather ask for pardon
for their infirmities, and, remembering that for so long he himself was
tried by the stings of similar passions till by the Lord’s mercy he was
saved, will feel that, as he was saved from carnal attacks not by the
teaching of his own exertions but by God’s protection, not anger but
pity ought to be shown to those who go astray; and with full peace of
mind will he sing to God <span id="page_419">p. 419</span> <span
id="iv.v.ii.ix-Page_419"></span>the following verse: “Thou hast broken
my chains. I will offer to Thee the sacrifice of praise;” and: “except
the Lord had helped me, my soul had almost dwelt in hell.” <span
id="fr_1704"></span>[1705](#fn_1704) And while he continues in this
humility of mind he will be able even to fulfil this Evangelic command
of perfection: “Love your enemies, do good to them that hate you, and
pray for them that persecute you and slander you.” <span
id="fr_1705"></span>[1706](#fn_1705) And so it will be vouchsafed to us
to attain that reward which is subjoined, whereby we shall not only bear
the image and likeness of God, but shall even be called sons: “that ye
may be,” says He “sons of your Father which is in heaven, Who maketh His
sun to rise on the good and evil, and sends rain on the just and on the
unjust:” <span id="fr_1706"></span>[1707](#fn_1706) and this feeling the
blessed John knew that he had attained when he said: “that we may have
confidence in the day of judgment, because as He is so are we also in
this world.” <span id="fr_1707"></span>[1708](#fn_1707) For in what can
a weak and fragile human nature be like Him, except in always showing a
calm love in its heart towards the good and evil, the just and the
unjust, in imitation of God, and by doing good for the love of goodness
itself, arriving at that true adoption of the sons of God, of which also
the blessed Apostle speaks as follows: “Every one that is born of God
doeth not sin, for His seed is in him, and he cannot sin, because he is
born of God;” and again: “We know that every one who is born of God
sinneth not, but his birth of God preserves him, and the wicked one
toucheth him not?” <span id="fr_1708"></span>[1709](#fn_1708) And this
must be understood not of all kinds of sins, but only of mortal sins:
and if any one will not extricate and cleanse himself from these, for
him the aforesaid Apostle tells us in another place that we ought not
even to pray, saying: “If a man knows his brother to be sinning a sin
not unto death, let him ask, and He will give him life for them that sin
not unto death. There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he should
ask for it.” <span id="fr_1709"></span>[1710](#fn_1709) But of those
which he says are not unto death, from which even those who serve Christ
faithfully cannot, with whatever care they keep themselves, be free, of
these he says: “If we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and
the truth is not in us;” and again: “If we say that we have not sinned,
we make Him a liar, and His word is not in us.” <span
id="fr_1710"></span>[1711](#fn_1710) For it is an impossibility for any
one of the saints not to fall into those trivial faults which are
committed by word, and thought, and ignorance, and forgetfulness, and
necessity, and will, and surprise: which though quite different from
that sin which is said to be unto death, still cannot be free from fault
and blame.
