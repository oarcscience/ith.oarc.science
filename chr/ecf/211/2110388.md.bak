#### <span id="iv.iii.v.xv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XV.

<span id="iv.iii.v.xv-p1"></span>How a monk must always be eager to
preserve his purity of heart.

<span id="iv.iii.v.xv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.v.xv-p2.1"></span>It</span> is like the case when one
endeavours to strike some mighty prize of virtue on high, pointed out by
some very small mark; with the keenest eyesight he points the aim of his
dart, knowing that large rewards of glory and prizes depend on his
hitting it; and he turns away his gaze from every other consideration,
and must direct it thither, where he sees that the reward and prize is
placed, because he would be sure to lose the prize of his skill and the
reward of his prowess if the keenness of his gaze should be diverted
ever so little. <span id="fr_838"></span>[839](#fn_838.md)
