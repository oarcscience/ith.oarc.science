#### <span id="iv.iv.ii.xii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XII.

<span id="iv.iv.ii.xii-p1"></span>A question on perseverance in
spiritual contemplation.

<span id="iv.iv.ii.xii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.ii.xii-p2.1"></span>Germanus</span>. Who then, while he is
burdened with our frail flesh, can be always so intent on this
contemplation, as never to think about the arrival of a brother, or
visiting the sick, or manual labour, or at least about showing kindness
to strangers and visitors? And lastly, who is not interrupted by
providing for the body, and looking after it? Or how and in what way can
the mind cling to the invisible and incomprehensible God, this we should
like to learn.
