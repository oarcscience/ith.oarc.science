#### <span id="iv.iv.iii.xxi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXI.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xxi-p1"></span>The answer concerning the value and
measure of well-proved abstinence.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xxi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.iii.xxi-p2.1"></span>Moses</span>: If you want to test the
force of this rule, keep to this limit continually, never departing from
it by taking any cooked food even on Sunday or Saturday, or on the
occasions of the arrival of any of the brethren; for the flesh,
refreshed by these exceptions, is able not only to support itself
through the rest of the week on a smaller quantity, but can also
postpone all refreshment without difficulty, as it is sustained by the
addition of that food which it has taken beyond the limit; while the man
who has always been satisfied with the full amount of the
above-mentioned measure will never be able to do this, nor to put off
breaking his fast till the morrow. For I remember that our Elders (and I
recollect that we ourselves also often had the same experience) found it
so hard and difficult to practise this abstinence, and observed the rule
laid down with such pain and hunger that it was almost against their
will and with tears and lamentation that they set this limit to their
meals.
