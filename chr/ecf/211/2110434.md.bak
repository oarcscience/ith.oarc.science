#### <span id="iv.iii.vii.xviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.

<span id="iv.iii.vii.xviii-p1"></span>That if we want to imitate the
apostles we ought not to live according to our own prescriptions, but to
follow their example.

<span id="iv.iii.vii.xviii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.vii.xviii-p2.1"></span>Wherefore</span> if we want to obey
the gospel precept, and to show ourselves the followers of the Apostle
and the whole primitive church, or of the fathers who in our own days
succeeded to their virtues and perfection, we should not acquiesce in
our own prescriptions, promising ourselves perfection from this wretched
and lukewarm condition of ours: but following their footsteps, we should
by no means aim at looking after our own interests, but should seek out
the discipline and system of a monastery, that we may in very truth
renounce this world; preserving nothing of those things which we have
despised through the temptation of want of faith; and should look for
our daily food, not from any store of money of our own, but from our own
labours.
