#### <span id="iv.iii.xii.xviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.

<span id="iv.iii.xii.xviii-p1"></span>How we are protected by the grace
of God not only in our natural condition, but also by His daily
Providence.

<span id="iv.iii.xii.xviii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.xii.xviii-p2.1"></span>Not</span> alone giving thanks to Him
for that He has created us as reasonable beings, and endowed us with the
power of free will, and blessed us with the grace of baptism, and
granted to us the knowledge and aid of the law, but for these things as
well, which are bestowed upon us by His daily providence; viz., that He
delivers us from the craft of our enemies; that He works with us so that
we can overcome the sins of the flesh, that, even without our knowing
it, He shields us from dangers; that He protects us from falling into
sin; that He helps us and enlightens us, so that we can understand and
recognize the actual help which He gives us, (which some will have it is
what is meant by the law); <span id="fr_1070"></span>[1071](#fn_1070.md)
that, when we are through His influence secretly struck with compunction
for our sins and negligences, He visits us with His regard <span
id="page_286">p. 286</span> <span
id="iv.iii.xii.xviii-Page_286"></span>and chastens us to our soul’s
health; that even against our will we are sometimes drawn by Him to
salvation; lastly that this very free will of ours, which is more
readily inclined to sin, is turned by Him to a better purpose, and by
His prompting and suggestion, bent towards the way of virtue.
