#### <span id="iv.iv.x.xxviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXVIII.

<span id="iv.iv.x.xxviii-p1"></span>A question about the fact that a
plentiful supply of tears is not in our own power.

<span id="iv.iv.x.xxviii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.x.xxviii-p2.1"></span>Germanus</span>: My own poor self indeed
is not altogether ignorant of this feeling of conviction. For often when
tears arise at the recollection of my faults, I have been by the Lord’s
visitation so refreshed by this ineffable joy which you describe that
the greatness of the joy has assured me that I ought not to despair of
their forgiveness. Than which state of mind I think there is nothing
more sublime if only it could be recalled at our own will. For sometimes
when I am desirous to stir myself up with all my power to the same
conviction and tears, and place before my eyes all my faults and sins, I
am unable to bring back that copiousness of tears, and so my eyes are
dry and hard like some hardest flint, so that not a single tear trickles
from them. And so in proportion as I congratulate myself on that
copiousness of tears, just so do I mourn that I cannot bring it back
again whenever I wish.
