#### <span id="iv.vii.vii.xvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVI.

<span id="iv.vii.vii.xvi-p1"></span>He shows further that this teaching
is destructive of the confession of the Trinity.

<span id="iv.vii.vii.xvi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.vii.xvi-p2.1"></span>But</span> still even if your obstinacy
and dishonesty are not restrained by this faith of the Creed, are you
not, I ask you, overwhelmed by an appeal to reason and the light of
truth? Tell me, I ask, whoever you are, O you heretic—At least there is
a Trinity, in which we believe, and which we confess: Father and Son and
Holy Ghost. Of the Glory of the Father and the Spirit there is no
question. You are slandering the Son, because you say that it was not
the same Person who was born of Mary, as He who was begotten of God the
Father. Tell me then: if you do not deny that the only Son of God was
begotten of God, whom do you make out that He is who was born of Mary?
You say “a mere man,” according to that which He Himself said: “That
which is born of the flesh, is flesh.” <span
id="fr_2564"></span>[2565](#fn_2564) But He cannot be called a mere man
who was begotten not after the law of human creation alone. “For that
which is conceived in her,” said the angel, “is of the Holy
Ghost.” <span id="fr_2565"></span>[2566](#fn_2565) And this even you
dare not deny, though you deny almost all the mysteries of salvation.
Since then He was born of the Holy Ghost, and cannot be termed a mere
man, as He was conceived by the inspiration of God, if it is not He who,
as the Apostle says, “emptied Himself by taking the form of a servant,”
and “the word was made flesh,” and “humbled Himself by becoming obedient
unto death,” and “who for our sakes, though He was rich, became
poor,” <span id="fr_2566"></span>[2567](#fn_2566) tell me, then, who He
is, who was born of the Holy Ghost, and was conceived by the
overshadowing of God? You say that He is certainly a different Person.
Then there are two Persons; viz., the one, who was begotten of God the
Father in heaven; and the other who was conceived of Mary, by the
inspiration of God. And thus there is a fourth Person whom you
introduce, and whom (though in words you term Him a mere man) you assert
actually not to have been a mere man, since you allow (not however as
you ought) that He is to be honoured, worshipped, and adored. Since then
the Son of God who was begotten of the Father is certainly to be
worshipped, and He who was conceived of Mary by the Holy Ghost is to
<span id="page_600">p. 600</span> <span
id="iv.vii.vii.xvi-Page_600"></span>be worshipped, you make two Persons
to be honoured and venerated, whom you so far sever from each other, as
to venerate each with an honour special and peculiar to Him. And thus
you see that by denying and by severing from Himself the Son of God, you
destroy, as far as you can, the whole mystery of the divinity. For while
you are endeavouring to introduce a fourth Person into the
Trinity, <span id="fr_2567"></span>[2568](#fn_2567) you see that you
have utterly denied the whole Trinity.
