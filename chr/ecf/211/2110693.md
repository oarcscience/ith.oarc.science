#### <span id="iv.iv.vii.ii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.ii-p1"></span>Abbot Theodore’s answer to the
question proposed to him.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.ii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.vii.ii-p2.1"></span>This</span> question often exercises the
minds of those who have not much faith or knowledge, and imagine that
the prizes and rewards of the saints (which are not given in this world,
but laid up for the future) are bestowed in the short space of this
mortal life. But we whose hope in Christ is not only in this life, for
fear lest, as the Apostle says, we should be “of all men most
miserable” <span id="fr_1366"></span>[1367](#fn_1366) (because as we
receive none of the promises in this world we should for our unbelief
lose them also in that to come) ought not wrongly to follow their ideas,
lest through ignorance of the true real explanation, we should hesitate
and tremble and fail in temptation, if we find ourselves given up to
such men; and should ascribe to God injustice or carelessness about the
affairs of mankind—a thing which it is almost a sin to mention—because
He does not protect in their temptations men who are living an upright
and holy life, nor requite good men with good things and evil men with
evil things in this world; and so we should deserve to fall under the
condemnation of those whom the prophet Zephaniah rebukes, saying “who
say in their hearts the Lord will not do good, nor will He do
evil:” <span id="fr_1367"></span>[1368](#fn_1367) or at least be found
among those of whom we are told that they blaspheme God with such
complaints as this: “Every one that doeth evil is good in the sight of
the Lord, and such please Him: for surely where is the God of
judgment?” <span id="fr_1368"></span>[1369](#fn_1368) Adding further
that blasphemy which is described in the same way in what follows: “He
laboureth in vain that serveth God, and what profit is it that we have
kept His ordinances, and walked sorrowful before the Lord? Wherefore now
we call the proud happy, for they that work wickedness are enriched, and
they have tempted God, and are preserved.” <span
id="fr_1369"></span>[1370](#fn_1369) Wherefore that we may avoid this
ignorance which is the root and cause of this most deadly error, we
ought in the first place to know what is really good, and what is bad,
and so finally if we grasp the true scriptural meaning of these words,
and not the false popular one, we shall escape being deceived by the
errors of unbelievers.
