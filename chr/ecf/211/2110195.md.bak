#### <span id="ii.vi.ii.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.

<span id="ii.vi.ii.vi-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.vi.ii.vi-p1.1"></span>After</span> Nabuchodonosor, the kingdom
fell to his son, whom I find called Euilmarodac in the Chronicles. He
died in the twelfth year of his reign, and made room for his younger
brother, who was called Balthasar. He, when in the fourteenth year he
gave a public feast to his chief men and rulers, ordered the sacred
vessels (which had been taken away by Nabuchodonosor from the temple at
Jerusalem, yet had not been employed for any uses of the king, but were
kept laid up in the treasury) to be brought forth. And when all persons,
both of the male and female sex, with his wives and concubines, were
using these amid the luxury and licentiousness of a royal banquet,
suddenly the king observed fingers writing upon the wall, and the
letters were perceived to be formed into words. <span
id="fr_334"></span>[335](#fn_334.md) But no one could be found who was able
to read the writing. The king, therefore, in perturbation called for the
magi and the Chaldæans. When these simply muttered among themselves and
answered nothing, the queen reminded the king that there was a certain
Hebrew, Daniel by name, who had formerly revealed to Nabuchodonosor a
dream containing a secret mystery, and had then, on account of his
remarkable wisdom, been promoted to the highest honors. Accordingly, he,
being sent for, read and interpreted the writing, to the effect that, on
account of the sin of the king, who had profaned vessels sacred to God,
destruction impended over him, and that his kingdom was given to the
Medes and Persians. And this presently took place. For, on the same
night, Balthasar perished, and Darius, a Mede by nation, took possession
of his kingdom. He again, finding that Daniel was held in the highest
reputation, placed him at the head of the whole empire, in this
following the judgment of the kings who had preceded him. For
Nabuchodonosor had also set him over the kingdom, and Balthasar had
presented him with a purple robe and a golden chain, while he also
constituted him the third ruler in the kingdom.

<span id="ii.vi.ii.vi-p2"></span> “in versum ductæ literæ”: various
emendations have been proposed, but the text may stand. The meaning
appears to be that the letters were not thrown together at random, but
so placed as to form words.
