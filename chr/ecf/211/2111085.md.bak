#### <span id="iv.vi.viii.xxv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXV.

<span id="iv.vi.viii.xxv-p1"></span>Of the good which an attack of
temptation brings about.

<span id="iv.vi.viii.xxv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.viii.xxv-p2.1"></span>And</span> so by the struggle with
temptation the kindly grace of the Saviour bestows on us larger rewards
of praise than if it had taken away from us all need of conflict. For it
is a mark of a loftier and grander virtue to remain ever unmoved when
hemmed in by persecutions and trials, and to stand faithfully and
courageously at the ramparts of God, and in the attacks of men, girt as
it were with the arms of unconquered virtue, to triumph gloriously over
impatience and somehow to gain strength out of weakness, for “strength
is made perfect in weakness.” “For behold I have made thee.” saith the
Lord, “a pillar of iron and a wall of brass, over all the land, to the
kings of Judah, and the princes and the <span id="page_543">p.
543</span> <span id="iv.vi.viii.xxv-Page_543"></span>priests thereof,
and all the people of the land. And they shall fight against thee and
shall not prevail: for I am with thee to deliver thee, saith the
Lord.” <span id="fr_2343"></span>[2344](#fn_2343.md) Therefore according to
the plain teaching of the Lord the king’s highway is easy and smooth,
though it may be felt as hard and rough: for those who piously and
faithfully serve Him, when they have taken upon them the yoke of the
Lord, and have learnt of Him, that He is meek and lowly of heart, at
once somehow or other lay aside the burden of earthly passions, and find
no labour but rest for their souls, by the gift of the Lord, as He
Himself testifies by Jeremiah the prophet, saying: “Stand ye on the ways
and see, and ask for the old paths, which is the good way, and walk ye
in it: and you shall find refreshment for your souls.” For to them at
once “the crooked shall become straight and the rough ways plain;” and
they shall “taste and see that the Lord is gracious,” <span
id="fr_2344"></span>[2345](#fn_2344.md) and when they hear Christ
proclaiming in the gospel: “Come unto Me all ye that labour and are
heavy laden, and I will refresh you,” they will lay aside the burden of
their sins, and realize what follows: “For My yoke is easy, and My
burden is light.” <span id="fr_2345"></span>[2346](#fn_2345.md) The way of
the Lord then has refreshment if it is kept to according to His law. But
it is we who by troublesome distractions bring sorrows and troubles upon
ourselves, while we try even with the utmost exertion and difficulty to
follow the crooked and perverse ways of this world. But when in this way
we have made the Lord’s yoke heavy and hard to us, we at once complain
in a blasphemous spirit of the hardness and roughness of the yoke itself
or of Christ who lays it upon us, in accordance with this passage: “The
folly of man corrupteth his ways, but he blames God in his heart;” <span
id="fr_2346"></span>[2347](#fn_2346.md) and as Haggai the prophet says,
when we say that “the way of the Lord is not right” the reply is aptly
made to us by the Lord: “Is not My way right? Are not your ways rather
crooked?” <span id="fr_2347"></span>[2348](#fn_2347.md) And indeed if you
will compare the sweet scented flower of virginity, and tender purity of
chastity to the foul and fetid sloughs of lust, the calm and security of
monks to the dangers and losses in which the men of this world are
involved, the peace of our poverty to the gnawing vexations and anxious
cares of riches, in which they are night and day consumed not without
the utmost peril to life, then you will prove that the yoke of Christ is
most easy and His burden most light.
