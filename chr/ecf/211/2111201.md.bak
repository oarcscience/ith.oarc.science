#### <span id="iv.vii.viii.xxvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXVI.

<span id="iv.vii.viii.xxvi-p1"></span>He adds to the foregoing the
testimony of S. Jerome.

<span id="iv.vii.viii.xxvi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.viii.xxvi-p2.1"></span>Jerome</span>, the Teacher of the
Catholics, whose writings shine like divine lamps throughout the whole
world, says in his book to Eustochium: “The Son of God for our salvation
was made the Son of man. He waits ten months in the womb to be born: and
He, in whose hand the world is held, is contained in a narrow
manger.” <span id="fr_2668"></span>[2669](#fn_2668.md) Again in his
commentary on Isaiah: “For the Lord of hosts, who is the King of glory,
Himself descended into the Virgin’s womb, and entered in and went forth
from the East Gate which is ever shut.” <span
id="fr_2669"></span>[2670](#fn_2669.md) Of whom Gabriel says to the Virgin:
“The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Most High
shall overshadow thee. Wherefore that holy thing which shall be born of
thee shall be called the Son of God.” And in Proverbs: “Wisdom hath
builded herself an house.” <span id="fr_2670"></span>[2671](#fn_2670.md)
Compare this if you please with your doctrine or rather your blasphemy,
in which you assert that God is the Creator of the months, and was not
an offspring of months. For lo, Jerome, a man of the greatest knowledge
and also of the most pure and approved doctrine testifies almost in the
very words in which you deny that the Son of God was an offspring of
months, that He was an offspring of months. For he says that He waits
ten months in the womb to be born. But perhaps the authority of this man
seems a mere nothing to you. You may take it that every one says the
same and in the same words, for whoever does not deny that the Son of
God is the offspring of the Virgin, admits that He is the offspring of
months.
