#### <span id="ii.iv.ii.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.

<span id="ii.iv.ii.iv-p1"></span>“<span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.ii.iv-p1.1"></span>I have</span> often noticed this,
Sulpitius, that Martin was accustomed to say to you, that such an
abundance <span id="fr_114"></span>[115](#fn_114.md) of power was by no
means granted him while he was a bishop, as he remembered to have
possessed before he obtained that office. Now, if this be true, or
rather since it is true, we may imagine how great those things were
which, while still a monk, he accomplished, and which, without any
witness, he effected apart by himself; since we have seen that, while a
bishop, he performed so great wonders before the eyes of all. Many, no
doubt, of his former achievements were known to the world, and could not
be hid, but those are said to have been innumerable which, while he
avoided boastfulness, he kept concealed and did not allow to come to the
knowledge of mankind; for, inasmuch as he transcended the capabilities
<span id="page_40">p. 40</span> <span id="ii.iv.ii.iv-Page_40"></span>of
mere man, in a consciousness of his own eminence, and trampling upon
worldly glory, he was content simply to have heaven as a witness of his
deeds. That this is true we can judge even from these things which are
well known to us, and could not be hid; since e.g. before he became a
bishop he restored two dead men to life, facts of which your book has
treated pretty fully, but, while he was bishop, he raised up only one, a
point which I am surprised you have not noticed. I myself am a witness
to this latter occurrence; but, probably, you have no doubts about the
matter being duly testified. At any rate, I will set before you the
affair as it happened. For some reason, I know not what, we were on our
way to the town of the Carnutes. <span id="fr_115"></span>[116](#fn_115.md)
In the meantime, as we pass by a certain village most populous in
inhabitants, an enormous crowd went forth to meet us, consisting
entirely of heathen; for no one in that village was acquainted with a
Christian. Nevertheless, owing to the report of the approach of so great
a man, a multitude of those streaming to one point had filled all the
widely spreading plains. Martin felt that some work was to be performed;
and as the spirit within him was thus moving him, he was deeply excited.
He at once began to preach to the heathen the word of God, so utterly
different from that of man, often groaning that so great a crowd should
be ignorant of the Lord the Saviour. In the meantime, while an
incredible multitude had surrounded us, a certain woman, whose son had
recently died, began to present, with outstretched hands, the lifeless
body to the blessed man, saying, “We know that you are a friend of God:
restore me my son, who is my only one.” The rest of the multitude joined
her, and added their entreaties to those of the mother. Martin
perceiving, as he afterwards told us, that he could manifest power, in
order to the salvation of those waiting for its display, received the
body of the deceased into his own hands; and when, in the sight of all,
he had fallen on his knees, and then arose, after his prayer was
finished, he restored to its mother the child brought back to life.
Then, truly, the whole multitude, raising a shout to heaven,
acknowledged Christ as God, and finally began to rush in crowds to the
knees of the blessed man, sincerely imploring that he would make them
Christians. Nor did he delay to do so. As they were in the middle of the
plain, he made them all catechumens, by placing his hand upon the whole
of them; while, at the same time, turning to us, he said that, not
without reason, were these made catechumens in that plain where the
martyrs were wont to be consecrated.”
