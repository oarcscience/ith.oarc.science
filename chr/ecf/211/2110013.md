#### <span id="ii.ii.x-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.

<span id="ii.ii.x-p1"></span>High Esteem in which Martin was held.

<span id="ii.ii.x-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.ii.x-p2.1"></span>Nearly</span> about the same time, Martin was
called upon to undertake the episcopate of the church at Tours; <span
id="fr_20"></span>[21](#fn_20.md) but when he could not easily be drawn
forth from his monastery, a certain Ruricius, one of the citizens,
pretending that his wife was ill, and casting himself down at his knees,
prevailed on him to go forth. Multitudes of the citizens having
previously been posted by the road on which he traveled, he is thus
under a kind of guard escorted to the city. An incredible number of
people not only from that town, but also from the neighboring cities,
had, in a wonderful manner, assembled to give their votes. <span
id="fr_21"></span>[22](#fn_21.md) There was but one wish among all, there
were the same prayers, and there was the same fixed opinion to the
effect that Martin was most worthy of the episcopate, and that the
church would be happy with such a priest. A few persons, however, and
among these some of the bishops, who had been summoned to appoint a
chief priest, were impiously offering resistance, asserting forsooth
that Martin’s person was contemptible, that he was unworthy of the
episcopate, that he was a man despicable in countenance, that his
clothing was mean, and his hair disgusting. This madness of theirs was
ridiculed by the people of sounder judgment, inasmuch as such objectors
only proclaimed the illustrious character of the man, while they sought
to slander him. Nor truly was it allowed them to do anything else, than
what the people, following the Divine will, desired <span
id="fr_22"></span>[23](#fn_22.md) to be accomplished. Among the bishops,
however, who had been present, a certain one of the name Defensor is
said to have specially offered opposition; and on this account it was
observed that he was at the time severely censured in the reading from
the prophets. For when it so happened that the reader, whose duty it was
to read in public that day, being blocked out by the people, failed to
appear, the officials falling into confusion, while they waited for him
who never came, one of those standing by, laying hold of the Psalter,
seized upon the first verse which presented itself to him. Now, the
Psalm ran thus: “Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast
perfected praise because of thine enemies, that thou mightest destroy
the enemy and the avenger.” <span id="fr_23"></span>[24](#fn_23.md) On
these words being read, a shout was raised by the people, and the
opposite party were confounded. It was believed that this Psalm had been
chosen by Divine ordination, that Defensor <span
id="fr_24"></span>[25](#fn_24.md) might hear a testimony to his own work,
because the praise of the Lord was perfected out of the mouth of babes
and sucklings in the case of Martin, while the enemy was at the same
time both pointed out and destroyed.

<span id="ii.ii.x-p3"></span> The Turones occupied territory on both
sides of the river Loire. Cæsar refers to them (*Bell. Gall*. ii. 35,
&c.). Their chief town was named Cæsarodunum, the modern Tours.

<span id="fn_21"></span>[8:22](2110013.htm#fr_21.md) <span
id="ii.ii.x-p3.1"></span>

<span id="ii.ii.x-p4"></span> It is clear from this passage that the
people at large were accustomed in ancient times to give their votes on
the appointment of a bishop.

<span id="fn_22"></span>[8:23](2110013.htm#fr_22.md) <span
id="ii.ii.x-p4.1"></span>

<span id="ii.ii.x-p5"></span> We here adopt Halm’s reading “cogitabat,”
in preference to the usual “cogebat.”

<span id="fn_23"></span>[8:24](2110013.htm#fr_23.md) <span
id="ii.ii.x-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ii.ii.x-p6"></span> [Ps. viii.
3](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#003.md)<span id="ii.ii.x-p6.1"></span>.

<span id="fn_24"></span>[8:25](2110013.htm#fr_24.md) <span
id="ii.ii.x-p6.2"></span>

<span id="ii.ii.x-p7"></span> The word translated “avenger” in the
English A.V. is “defensor” in the Vulgate, and thus the man referred to
would have seemed to be expressly named.
