<span id="iv.iv.ix.xxiv"></span>

#### <span id="iv.iv.ix.xxiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXIV.

<span id="iv.iv.ix.xxiv-p1"></span>Of the fact that they were justly
punished, who sinned before the flood.

<span id="iv.iv.ix.xxiv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.ix.xxiv-p2.1"></span>And</span> so then we see that from the
beginning God created everything perfect, nor would there have been need
for anything to have been added to His original arrangement—as if it
were shortsighted and imperfect—if everything had continued in that
state and condition in which it had been created by Him. And therefore
in the case of those who sinned before the law and even before the flood
we see that God visited them with a righteous judgment, because they
deserved to be punished without any excuse, for having transgressed the
law of nature; nor should we fall into the blasphemous slanders of those
who are ignorant of this reason, and so depreciate the God of the Old
Testament, and run down our faith, and say with a sneer: Why then did it
please your God to will to promulgate the law after so many thousand
years, while He suffered such long ages to pass without any law? But if
He afterwards discovered something better, then it appears that at the
beginning of the world His wisdom was inferior and poorer, and that
afterwards as if taught by experience He began to provide for something
better, and to amend and improve His original arrangements. A thing
which certainly cannot happen to the infinite foreknowledge of God, nor
can these assertions be made about Him by the mad folly of heretics
without grievous blasphemy, as Ecclesiastes says: “I have learnt that
all the words which God hath made from the beginning shall continue
forever: nothing can be added to them, and nothing can be taken away
from them,” <span id="fr_1567"></span>[1568](#fn_1567.md) and therefore
“the law is not made for the righteous, but for the unrighteous, and
insubordinate, for the ungodly and sinners, for the wicked and
profane.” <span id="fr_1568"></span>[1569](#fn_1568.md) For as they had the
sound and complete system of natural laws implanted in them they had no
need of this external law in addition, and one committed to writing, and
what was given as an aid to that natural law. From which we infer by the
clearest of reasonings that that law committed to writing need not have
been given at the beginning (for it was <span id="page_386">p.
386</span> <span id="iv.iv.ix.xxiv-Page_386"></span>unnecessary for this
to be done while the natural law still remained, and was not utterly
violated) nor could evangelical perfection have been granted before the
law had been kept. For they could not have listened to this saying: “If
a man strikes thee on the right cheek, turn to him the other
also,” <span id="fr_1569"></span>[1570](#fn_1569.md) who were not content
to avenge wrongs done to them with the even justice of the *lex
talionis*, but repaid a very slight touch with deadly kicks and wounds
with weapons, and for a single truth sought to take the life of those
who had struck them. Nor could it be said to them, “love your
enemies,” <span id="fr_1570"></span>[1571](#fn_1570.md) among whom it was
considered a great thing and most important if they loved their friends,
but avoided their enemies and dissented from them only in hatred without
being eager to oppress and kill them.
