#### <span id="iv.vi.ii.x-p0.1"></span>Chapter X.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.x-p1"></span>The answer.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.x-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.x-p2.1"></span>Piamun</span>: Although many people
indifferently speak of monasteries instead of Cœnobia, yet there is this
difference, that monastery is the title of the dwelling, and means
nothing more than the place, i.e., the habitation of monks, while
Cœnobium describes the character of the life and its system: and
monastery may mean the dwelling of a single monk, while a Cœnobium
cannot be spoken of except where dwells a united community of a large
number of men living together. They are however termed monasteries in
which groups of Sarabaites live.
