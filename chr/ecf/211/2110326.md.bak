#### <span id="iv.iii.iii.x-p0.1"></span>Chapter X.

<span id="iv.iii.iii.x-p1"></span>How it was brought about that they
fast on the Sabbath in the city.

<span id="iv.iii.iii.x-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.iii.x-p2.1"></span>But</span> some people in some countries
of the West, and especially in the city, <span
id="fr_751"></span>[752](#fn_751.md) not knowing the reason of this
indulgence, think that a dispensation from fasting ought certainly not
to be allowed on the Sabbath, because they say that on this day the
Apostle Peter fasted before his encounter with Simon. <span
id="fr_752"></span>[753](#fn_752.md) But from this it is quite clear that
he did this not in accordance with a canonical rule, but rather through
the needs of his impending struggle. Since there, too, for the same
purpose, Peter seems to have imposed on his disciples not a general but
a special fast, which he certainly would not have done if he had known
that it was wont to be observed by canonical rule: just as he would
surely have been ready to appoint it even on Sunday, if the occasion of
his struggle had fallen upon it: but no canonical rule of fasting would
have been made general from this, because it was no general observance
that led to it, but a matter of necessity, which forced it to be
observed on a single occasion.

<span id="iv.iii.iii.x-p4"></span> The Saturday fast was observed at
Rome in very early days, being noticed by Tertullian, who seems to
suggest that it originated in the prolongation of the Friday fast (*on
Fasting*, c. xiv). But it seems to have been almost peculiar to Rome,
and at Milan, in the time of S. Ambrose, the Eastern custom prevailed.
See the important letter of Augustine to Casulanus (*Ep*. xxxvi.), where
the whole subject of the difference of usage on this matter is fully
discussed. The reason here given by Cassian for the origin of the local
Roman custom (viz., that S. Peter’s traditional encounter with Simon
Magus took place on Sunday, and was prepared for by the apostle with a
Saturday fast) is also there alluded to by Augustine as being the
opinion of very many, though he tells us candidly that most of the
Romans thought it false. “Est quidem et hæc opinio plurimorum, quamvis
eam perhibeant esse falsam plerique Romani, quod Apostolus Petrus cum
Simone Mago die dominico certaturo, propter ipsum magnæ tentationis
periculum, pridie cum ejusdem urbis ecclesia jejunaverit, et consecuto
tam prospero gloriosoque successu, eundem morem tenuerit, eumque imitatæ
sunt nonnullæ Occidentis ecclesiæ.” Cf. also Augustine, *Ep. ad
Januarium*, liv.
