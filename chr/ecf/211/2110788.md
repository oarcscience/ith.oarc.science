<span id="iv.iv.x.xviii"></span>

#### <span id="iv.iv.x.xviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.

<span id="iv.iv.x.xviii-p1"></span>Of the Lord’s Prayer.

<span id="iv.iv.x.xviii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.x.xviii-p2.1"></span>And</span> so there follows after these
different kinds of supplication a still more sublime and exalted
condition which is brought about by the contemplation of God alone and
by fervent love, by which the mind, transporting and flinging itself
into love for Him, addresses God most familiarly as its own Father with
a piety of its own. And that we ought earnestly to seek after this
condition the formula of the Lord’s prayer teaches us, saying “Our
Father.” When then we confess with our own mouths that the God and Lord
of the universe is our Father, we profess forthwith that we have been
called from our condition as slaves to the adoption of sons, adding next
“Which art in heaven,” that, by shunning with the utmost horror all
lingering in this present life, which we pass upon this earth as a
pilgrimage, and what separates us by a great distance from our Father,
we may the rather hasten with all eagerness to that country where we
confess that our Father dwells, and may not allow anything of this kind,
which would make us unworthy of this our profession and the dignity of
an adoption of this kind, and so deprive us as a disgrace to our
Father’s inheritance, and make us incur the wrath of His justice and
severity. To which state and condition of sonship when we have advanced,
we shall forthwith be inflamed with the piety which belongs to good
sons, so that we shall bend all our energies to the advance not of our
own profit, but of our Father’s glory, saying to Him: “Hallowed be Thy
name,” testifying that our desire and our joy is His glory, becoming
imitators of Him who said: “He who speaketh of himself, seeketh his own
glory. But He who seeks the glory of Him who sent Him, the same is true
and there is no unrighteousness in Him.” <span
id="fr_1604"></span>[1605](#fn_1604.md) Finally the chosen vessel being
filled with this feeling wished that he could be anathema from
Christ <span id="fr_1605"></span>[1606](#fn_1605.md) if only the people
belonging to Him might be increased and multiplied, and the salvation of
the whole nation of Israel accrue to the glory of His Father; for with
all assurance could he wish to die for Christ as he knew that no one
perished for life. And again he says: “We <span id="page_394">p.
394</span> <span id="iv.iv.x.xviii-Page_394"></span>rejoice when we are
weak but ye are strong.” <span id="fr_1606"></span>[1607](#fn_1606.md) And
what wonder if the chosen vessel wished to be anathema from Christ for
the sake of Christ’s glory and the conversion of His own brethren and
the privilege of the nation, when the prophet Micah wished that he might
be a liar and a stranger to the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, if only
the people of the Jews might escape those plagues and the going forth
into captivity which he had announced in his prophecy, saying: “Would
that I were not a man that hath the Spirit, and that I rather spoke a
lie;” <span id="fr_1607"></span>[1608](#fn_1607.md) —to pass over that wish
of the Lawgiver, who did not refuse to die together with his brethren
who were doomed to death, saying: “I beseech Thee, O Lord; this people
hath sinned a heinous sin; either forgive them this trespass, or if Thou
do not, blot me out of Thy book which Thou hast written.” <span
id="fr_1608"></span>[1609](#fn_1608.md) But where it is said “Hallowed be
Thy name,” it may also be very fairly taken in this way: “The hallowing
of God is our perfection.” And so when we say to Him “Hallowed be Thy
name” we say in other words, make us, O Father, such that we maybe able
both to understand and take in what the hallowing of Thee is, or at any
rate that Thou mayest be seen to be hallowed in our spiritual converse.
And this is effectually fulfilled in our case when “men see our good
works, and glorify our Father Which is in heaven.” <span
