#### <span id="iv.iv.ix.xxii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXII.

<span id="iv.iv.ix.xxii-p1"></span>An objection, as to how an unlawful
intermingling with the daughters of Cain could be charged against the
line of Seth before the prohibition of the law.

<span id="iv.iv.ix.xxii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.ix.xxii-p2.1"></span>Germanus</span>: If that command had been
given to them, then the sin of breaking it might fairly have been
brought against them for their audacity in so marrying. But since the
observance of that separation had not yet been established by any rule,
how could that intermingling of races be counted wrong in them, as it
had not been forbidden by any command? For a law does not ordinarily
forbid crimes that are past, but those that are future.
