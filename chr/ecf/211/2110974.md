<span id="iv.vi.iii.iv"></span>

#### <span id="iv.vi.iii.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.iv-p1"></span>Of the excellence which the aforesaid
old man showed in the system of the anchorites.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.iv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.iv-p2.1"></span>If</span> then anyone else delights in the
recesses of the desert and would forget all human intercourse and say
with Jeremiah: “I have not desired the day of man: Thou knowest,” <span
id="fr_2107"></span>[2108](#fn_2107) I confess that by the blessing of
God’s grace, I also secured or at any rate tried to secure this. And so
by the kind gift of the Lord I remember that I was often caught up into
such an ecstasy as to forget that I was clothed with the burden of a
weak body, and my soul on a sudden forgot all external notions and
entirely cut itself off from all material objects, so that neither my
eyes nor ears performed their proper functions. And my soul was so
filled with divine meditations <span id="page_491">p. 491</span> <span
id="iv.vi.iii.iv-Page_491"></span>and spiritual contemplations that
often in the evening I did not know whether I had taken any food and on
the next day was very doubtful whether I had broken my fast yesterday.
For which reason, a supply of food for seven days, i.e., seven sets of
biscuits were set apart in a sort of hand-basket, <span
id="fr_2108"></span>[2109](#fn_2108) and laid by on Saturday, that there
might be no doubt when supper had been omitted; and by this plan another
mistake also from forgetfulness was obviated, for when the number of
cakes was finished it showed that the course of the week was over, and
that the services of the same day had come round, and that the festival
and holy day and services of the congregation could not escape the
notice of the solitary. But even if that ecstasy of mind of which we
have spoken should happen to interfere with this arrangement, yet still
the method of the days’ work would show the number of the days and check
the mistake. And to pass over in silence the other advantages of the
desert (for it is not our business to treat of their number and
quantity, but rather of the aim of solitude and the Cœnobium) I will the
rather briefly explain the reasons why I preferred to leave it, which
you also wanted to know, and will in a concise discourse glance at all
those fruits of solitude which I mentioned, and show to what greater
advantages on the other side they ought to be held inferior.
