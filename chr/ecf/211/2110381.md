#### <span id="iv.iii.v.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VIII.

<span id="iv.iii.v.viii-p1"></span>How food should be taken with regard
to the aim at perfect continence. <span
id="fr_830"></span>[831](#fn_830)

<span id="iv.iii.v.viii-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.v.viii-p3.1"></span>And</span> so it is a very true and most
excellent saying of the Fathers that the right method of fasting and
abstinence lies in the measure of moderation and bodily chastening; and
that this is the aim of perfect virtue for all alike, viz.: that though
we are still forced to desire it, yet we should exercise self-restraint
in the matter of the food, which we are obliged to take owing to the
necessity of supporting the body. For even if one is weak in body, he
can attain to a perfect virtue and one equal to that of those who are
thoroughly strong and healthy, if with firmness of mind he keeps a check
upon the desires and lusts which are not due to weakness of the flesh.
For the Apostle says: “And take not care for the flesh in its
lusts.” <span id="fr_831"></span>[832](#fn_831) He does not forbid care
for it in every respect: but says that care is not to be taken in regard
to its desires and lusts. He cuts away the luxurious fondness for the
flesh: he does not exclude the control necessary for life: he does the
former, lest through pampering the flesh we should be involved in
dangerous entanglements of the desires; the latter lest the body should
be injured by our fault and unable to fulfil its spiritual and necessary
duties.
