#### <span id="ii.v.i.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.

<span id="ii.v.i.iv-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.i.iv-p1.1"></span>Against</span> these, from among the company
of the saints, righteous Noah shall first proclaim, “I, Lord, predicted
that a deluge was about to come on account of the sins of men, and after
the deluge I set an example to the good in my own person; since I did
not perish with the wicked who perished, that they might know both what
was the salvation of the innocent, and what the punishment of sinners.”
After him, faithful Abraham will say in opposition to them, “I, Lord,
about the mid-time <span id="fr_145"></span>[146](#fn_145) of the age of
the world, laid the foundation of the faith by which the human race
should believe in thee; I was chosen as the father of the nations, that
they might follow my example; I did not hesitate, Lord, to offer Isaac,
while yet a youth, as a sacrifice to thee, that they might understand
that there is nothing which ought not to be presented to the Lord, when
they perceived that I did not spare even my only son: I left, Lord, my
country, and my family, at thy command, that they also might have an
example teaching them to leave the wickedness of the world and the age:
I, Lord, was the first to recognize thee, though under a corporeal <span
id="fr_146"></span>[147](#fn_146) form, nor did I hesitate to believe
who it was that I beheld, although thou didst appear to me in a
different form from thine own, that these might learn to judge, not
according to the flesh, but according to the spirit.”  Him the blessed
Moses will support in his pleadings, saying: “I Lord, delivered the law
to all these, at thy command, that those whom a free <span
id="fr_147"></span>[148](#fn_147) faith did not influence, the spoken
law at least might restrain: I said, ‘Thou shalt not <span
id="fr_148"></span>[149](#fn_148) commit adultery,’ in order that I
might prevent the licentiousness of fornication: I said, ‘Thou shalt
love <span id="fr_149"></span>[150](#fn_149) thy neighbor,’ that
affection might abound; I said, ‘Thou shalt worship the Lord
alone,’ <span id="fr_150"></span>[151](#fn_150) in order that these
might not sacrifice to idols, or allow temples to exist; I commanded
that false witness should not be spoken, that I might shut the lips of
these people against all falsehood. I set forth the things which had
been done and said from the beginning of the world, through the working
within me of the spirit of thy power, that a knowledge of things past
might convey to these people instruction about things to come. I
predicted, O Lord Jesus, thy coming, that it might not be an unexpected
thing to these people, when they were called to acknowledge him whom I
had before announced as about to come.” <span

<span id="fn_145"></span>[56:146](2110104.htm#fr_145) <span

<span id="ii.v.i.iv-p2"></span> Abraham lived (in round numbers) about
2000 years <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.i.iv-p2.1"></span>b.c.</span>, and assuming the beginning of
the world to have been about 4000 years <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.i.iv-p2.2"></span>b.c</span>., he may thus be said to have
lived about “the mid-time.” The note of Clericus which refers the words
to the *end* of the world seems quite mistaken.
