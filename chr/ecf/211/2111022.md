#### <span id="iv.vi.v.xxii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXII.

<span id="iv.vi.v.xxii-p1"></span>The answer on the way to keep control
over abstinence.

<span id="iv.vi.v.xxii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.v.xxii-p2.1"></span>Theonas</span>: If we weigh everything
that we do, by a reasonable judgment of the mind, and on the purity of
our heart always consult not the opinions of other people but our own
conscience, that interval for refreshment is sure not to interfere with
our proper strictness, if only, as was said, our pure mind impartially
considers the right limits of indulgence and abstinence, and fairly
checks excess in either, and with real discrimination discerns whether
the weight of the delicacies is a burden upon our spirits, or whether
too much austerity in abstaining weighs down the other side, i.e., that
of the body, and either depresses or raises that side which it sees to
be raised or weighed down. For our Lord would have nothing done to His
honour and glory without being tempered by judgment, for “the honour of
a <span id="page_512">p. 512</span> <span
id="iv.vi.v.xxii-Page_512"></span>king loveth judgment,” <span
id="fr_2193"></span>[2194](#fn_2193) and therefore Solomon, the wisest
of men, urges us not to let our judgment incline to either side, saying:
“Honour God with thy righteous labours and offer to Him of the fruits of
thy righteousness.” <span id="fr_2194"></span>[2195](#fn_2194) For we
have residing in our conscience an uncorrupt and true judge who
sometimes, when all are wrong, is the only person not deceived as to the
state of our purity. And so with all care and pains we should preserve a
constant purpose in our circumspect heart for fear lest if the judgment
of our discretion goes wrong, we may be fired with the desire for an
ill-considered abstinence, or allured by the wish for an excessive
relaxation, and so weigh the substance of our strength in the tongue of
an unfair balance; but we should place in one of the scales our purity
of soul, and in the other our bodily strength, and weigh them both in
the true judgment of conscience, so that we may not perversely incline
the scale of fairness to either side, either to undue strictness or to
excessive relaxation, from the preponderating desire for one or the
other, and so have this said to us by reason of excessive strictness or
relaxation: “If thou offerest rightly, but dost not divide rightly, hast
thou not sinned?” <span id="fr_2195"></span>[2196](#fn_2195) For those
offerings of fasts, which we thoughtlessly extort by violently tearing
our bowels, and fancy that we rightly offer to the Lord, these He
execrates who “loves mercy and judgment” saying: “I the Lord love
judgment, but I hate robbery in a burnt offering.” <span
id="fr_2196"></span>[2197](#fn_2196) Those also who take the main part
of their offerings, i.e., their offices and actions, to benefit the
flesh for their own use, but leave the remains of them and a tiny
portion for the Lord, these the Divine Word thus condemns as fraudulent
workmen: “Cursed is he that doeth the work of the Lord
fraudulently.” <span id="fr_2197"></span>[2198](#fn_2197) It is not then
without reason that the Lord reproves him who thus deceives himself by
unfair considerations, saying: “But vain are the children of men: the
children of men are liars upon the balances that they may
deceive.” <span id="fr_2198"></span>[2199](#fn_2198) And therefore the
blessed Apostle warns us to keep hold of the reins of discretion and not
to be attracted by excess and swerve to either side, saying: “Your
reasonable service.” <span id="fr_2199"></span>[2200](#fn_2199) And the
giver of the law similarly forbids the same thing, saying: “Let the
balance be just and the weights equal, the bushel just and the sextarius
equal,” <span id="fr_2200"></span>[2201](#fn_2200) and Solomon also
gives a like opinion on this matter: “Great and small weights and double
measures are both unclean before the Lord, and one who uses them shall
be hindered in his contrivances.” <span
id="fr_2201"></span>[2202](#fn_2201) Further not only in the way in
which we have said, but also in this must we strive not to have unfair
weights in our hearts, nor double measures in the storehouse of our
conscience, i.e., not to overwhelm those, to whom we are to preach the
word of the Lord, with precepts that are too strict and heavier than we
ourselves can bear, while we take for granted that for ourselves those
things which have to do with the rule of strictness are to be softened
by a freer allowance of relaxation. For when we do this, what is it but
to weigh and measure the goods and fruits of the Lord’s commands in a
double weight and measure? For if we dispense them in one way to
ourselves and in another to our brethren, we are rightly blamed by the
Lord because we have unfair balances and double measures, in accordance
with the saying of Solomon which tells us that “A double weight is an
abomination to the Lord, and a deceitful balance is not good in His
sight.” <span id="fr_2202"></span>[2203](#fn_2202) In this way also we
plainly incur the guilt of using a deceitful weight and a double
measure, if out of the desire for the praise of men, we make a show
before the brethren of greater strictness than what we practice in
private in our own cells, trying to appear more abstinent and holier in
the sight of men than in the sight of God, an evil which we should not
only avoid but actually loathe. But meanwhile as we have wandered some
way from the question before us, let us return to the point from which
we started.
