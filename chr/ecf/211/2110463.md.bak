#### <span id="iv.iii.viii.xv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XV.

<span id="iv.iii.viii.xv-p1"></span>How the Old Law would root out anger
not only from the actions but from the thoughts.

<span id="iv.iii.viii.xv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.viii.xv-p2.1"></span>But</span> why should we spend any more
time over evangelic and apostolic precepts, when even the old law, which
is thought to be some<span id="page_262">p. 262</span> <span
id="iv.iii.viii.xv-Page_262"></span>what slack, guards against the same
thing, when it says, “Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart;”
and again, “Be not mindful of the injury of thy citizens;” <span
id="fr_942"></span>[943](#fn_942.md) and again, “The ways of those who
preserve the recollection of wrongs are towards death”? <span
id="fr_943"></span>[944](#fn_943.md) You see there too that wickedness is
restrained not only in action, but also in the secret thoughts, since it
is commanded that hatred be utterly rooted out from the heart, and not
merely retaliation for, but the very recollection of, a wrong done.
