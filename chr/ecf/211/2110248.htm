<p class="subh"><a name="iii.vii-p1"></A>The example of Pope Stephen in resisting the Iteration of Baptism.</p>  
<p class="skip"><a name="iii.vii-p2"></A>[15.] <span class="sc"><a name="iii.vii-p2.1"></A>Great</span> then is the example of these same blessed men, an example plainly divine, and worthy to be called to mind, and meditated  <A NAME="page_135"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 135</FONT></A> <a name="iii.vii-Page_135"></A>upon continually by every true Catholic, who, like the seven-branched candlestick, shining with the sevenfold light of the Holy Spirit, showed to posterity how thenceforward the audaciousness of profane novelty, in all the several rantings of error, might be crushed by the authority of hallowed antiquity.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vii-p3"></A>Nor is there anything new in this? For it has always been the case in the Church, that the more a man is under the influence of religion, so much the more prompt is he to oppose innovations. Examples there are without number: but to be brief, we will take one, and that, in preference to others, from the Apostolic See,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_437"></A><A HREF="#fn_437"><FONT SIZE="1">438</FONT></A>
 so that it may be clearer than day to every one with how great energy, with how great zeal, with how great earnestness, the blessed successors of the blessed apostles have constantly defended the integrity of the religion which they have once received.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.vii-p5"></A>[16.] Once on a time then, Agrippinus,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_438"></A><A HREF="#fn_438"><FONT SIZE="1">439</FONT></A>
 bishop of Carthage, of venerable memory, held the doctrine&#8212;and he was the first who held it&#8212;that Baptism ought to be repeated, contrary to the divine canon, contrary to the rule of the universal Church, contrary to the customs and institutions of our ancestors. This innovation drew after it such an amount of evil, that it not only gave an example of sacrilege to heretics of all sorts, but proved an occasion of error to certain Catholics even.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vii-p7"></A>When then all men protested against the novelty, and the priesthood everywhere, each as his zeal prompted him, opposed it, Pope Stephen of blessed memory, Prelate of the Apostolic See, in conjunction indeed with his colleagues but yet himself the foremost, withstood it, thinking it right, I doubt not, that as he exceeded all others in the authority of his place, so he should also in the devotion of his faith. In fine, in an epistle sent at the time to Africa, he laid down this rule: &#8220;Let there be no innovation&#8212;nothing but what has been handed down.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_439"></A><A HREF="#fn_439"><FONT SIZE="1">440</FONT></A>
 For that holy and prudent man well knew that true piety admits no other rule than that whatsoever things have been faithfully received from our fathers the same are to be faithfully consigned to our children; and that it is our duty, not to lead religion whither we would, but rather to follow religion whither it leads; and that it is the part of Christian modesty and gravity not to hand down our own beliefs or observances to those who come after us, but to preserve and keep what we have received from those who went before us. What then was the issue of the whole matter?  What but the usual and customary one? Antiquity was retained, novelty was rejected.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vii-p9"></A>[17.] But it may be, the cause of innovation at that time lacked patronage. On the contrary, it had in its favor such powerful talent, such copious eloquence, such a number of partisans, so much resemblance to truth, such weighty support in Scripture (only interpreted in a novel and perverse sense), that it seems to me that that whole conspiracy could not possibly have been defeated, unless the sole cause of this extraordinary stir, the very novelty of what was so undertaken, so defended, so belauded, had proved wanting to it. In the end, what result, under God, had that same African Council or decree?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_440"></A><A HREF="#fn_440"><FONT SIZE="1">441</FONT></A>
 None whatever. The whole affair, as though a dream, a fable, a thing of no possible account, was annulled, cancelled, and trodden underfoot.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.vii-p11"></A>[18.] And O marvellous revolution! The authors of this same doctrine are judged Catholics, the followers heretics; the teachers are absolved, the disciples condemned; the writers of the books will be children of the Kingdom, the defenders of them will have their portion in Hell. For who is so demented as to doubt that that blessed light among all holy bishops and martyrs, Cyprian, together with the rest of his colleagues, will reign with Christ; or, who on the other hand so sacrilegious as to deny that the Donatists and those other pests, who boast the authority of that council for their iteration of baptism, will be consigned to eternal fire with the devil?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_441"></A><A HREF="#fn_441"><FONT SIZE="1">442</FONT></A>

<p class="endnote"><a name="iii.vii-p4"></A> &#8220;The Apostolic see&#8221; (Sedes Apostolica) here means Rome of course. But the title was not restricted to Rome. It was common to all sees which could claim an apostle as their Founder. Thus St. Augustine, suggesting a rule for determining what books are to be regarded as Canonical, says, &#8220;In Canonicis Scripturis Ecclesiarum Catholicarum quamplurium auctoritatem sequatur, inter quas sane ill&aelig; sint qu&aelig; Apostolicas Sedes habere et Epistolas accipere meruerunt.&#8221; &#8220;Let him follow the authority of those Catholic Churches which have been counted worthy to have Apostolic Sees; <i>i.e</i>., to have been founded by Apostles, and to have been the recipients of Apostolic Epistles.&#8221;&#8212;<i>De Doctr.  Christiana</i>, II. &sect; 13. But the title, even in St. Augustine&#146;s time, had even a wider meaning. &#8220;Anciently every bishop&#146;s see was dignified with the title of Sedes Apostolica, which in those days was no peculiar title of the bishop of Rome, but given to all bishops in general, as deriving their origin and counting their succession from the apostles.&#8221;&#8212;<i>Bingham, Antiq</i>. II., c. 2, &sect; 3.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="iii.vii-p8"></A> Stephen&#146;s letter has not come down to us, happily perhaps for his credit, judging by the terms in which Cyprian speaks of it in the letter in which he quotes the passage in the text.&#8212;<i>Ad Pompeian</i>, Ep. 74<a name="iii.vii-p8.1"></A>.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="iii.vii-p10"></A> The Council held under the presidency of Cyprian in 256. Its acts are contained in Cyprian&#146;s works, Ed. Fell. pp. 158, etc. An earlier council had been held in the same city in the beginning of the century under Agrippinus. Both had affirmed the necessity of rebaptizing heretics, or, as they would rather have said, of baptizing them. The controversy was set at rest by a decision of the council of Arles, in 314, which ordered, in its Eighth Canon, that if the baptism had been administered in the name of the Trinity, converts should be admitted simply by the imposition of hands that they might receive the Holy Ghost.</p>
