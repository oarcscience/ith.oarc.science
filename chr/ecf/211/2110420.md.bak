#### <span id="iv.iii.vii.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.

<span id="iv.iii.vii.iv-p1"></span>That we can say that there exist in
us some natural faults, without wronging the Creator.

<span id="iv.iii.vii.iv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.vii.iv-p2.1"></span>If</span> then we say that these impulses
were implanted in us by the Creator, He will not on that account seem
blameworthy, if we choose wrongly to abuse them, and to pervert them to
harmful purposes, and are ready to be made sorry by means of the useless
Cains of this world, and not by means of showing penitence and the
correction of our faults: or at least if we are angry not with ourselves
(which would be profitable) but with our brethren in defiance of God’s
command. For in the case of iron, which is given us for good and useful
purposes, if any one should pervert it for murdering the innocent, one
would not therefore blame the maker of the metal because man had used to
injure others that which he had provided for good and useful purposes of
living happily.
