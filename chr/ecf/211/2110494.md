#### <span id="iv.iii.x.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.

<span id="iv.iii.x.ix-p1"></span>That not the Apostle only, but those
two who were with him laboured with their own hands.

<span id="iv.iii.x.ix-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.x.ix-p2.1"></span>And</span> he testifies that it was not he
alone who so lived among them, lest haply this method might not seem
important or general if he depended only on his example. But he declares
that all those who were appointed with him for the ministry of the
gospel, i.e., Silvanus and Timothy, who wrote this with him, worked in
the same fashion. For by saying, “lest we should be burdensome to any of
you, he covers them with great shame. For if he who preached the gospel
and commended it by signs and mighty works, did not dare to eat bread
for nought, lest he should be burdensome to any, how can those men help
thinking that they are burdensome who take it every day in idleness and
at their leisure?

hands, that he might set us an example of work.](2110495)
