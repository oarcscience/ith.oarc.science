#### <span id="iv.iii.v.xxvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXVII.

<span id="iv.iii.v.xxvii-p1"></span>What the two Abbots Pæsius and John
said of the fruits of their zeal.

<span id="iv.iii.v.xxvii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.v.xxvii-p2.1"></span>When</span> the aged John, who was
superior of a large monastery and of a quantity of brethren, had come to
visit the aged Pæsius, who was living in a vast desert, and had been
asked of him as of a very old friend, what he had done in all the forty
years in which he had been separated from him and had scarcely ever been
disturbed in his solitude by the brethren: “Never,” said he, “has the
sun seen me eating,” “nor me angry,” said the other. <span

<span id="iv.iii.v.xxvii-p3"></span> There is a Pæsius mentioned by
Palladius in the Lausiac History, but it is not clear whether he is the
same man whom Cassian mentions. John is a different person from the one
already mentioned in Book IV. xxiii. He is mentioned again below in xl.,
and the Nineteenth Conference is assigned to him.
