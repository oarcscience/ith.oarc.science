#### <span id="iv.vi.v.xxx-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXX.

<span id="iv.vi.v.xxx-p1"></span>Of the origin and beginning of Lent.

<span id="iv.vi.v.xxx-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.v.xxx-p2.1"></span>Howbeit</span> you should know that as long
as the primitive church retained its perfection unbroken, this
observance of Lent did not exist. For they were not bound by the
requirements of this order, or by any legal enactments, nor confined in
the very narrow limits of the fast, as the fast embraced equally the
whole year round. But when the multitude of believers began day by day
to decline from that apostolic fervour, and to look after their own
wealth, and not to portion it out for the good of all the faithful in
accordance with <span id="page_516">p. 516</span> <span
id="iv.vi.v.xxx-Page_516"></span>the arrangement of the apostles, but
having an eye to their own private expenses, tried not only to keep it
but actually to increase it, not content with following the example of
Ananias and Sapphira, then it seemed good to all the priests that men
who were hampered by worldly cares, and almost ignorant, if I may say
so, of abstinence and contrition, should be recalled to the pious duty
by a fast canonically enjoined, and be constrained by the necessity of
paying the legal tithes, as this certainly would be good for the weak
brethren and could not do any harm to the perfect who were living under
the grace of the gospel and by their voluntary devotion going beyond the
law, so as to succeed in attaining to the blessedness which the Apostle
speaks of: “For sin shall not have dominion over you; for ye are not
under the law but under grace.” <span
id="fr_2214"></span>[2215](#fn_2214.md) For of a truth sin cannot exercise
dominion over one who lives faithfully under the liberty of grace.
