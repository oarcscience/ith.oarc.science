#### <span id="iv.iii.v.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.

<span id="iv.iii.v.vi-p1"></span>That the mind is not intoxicated by
wine alone.

<span id="iv.iii.v.vi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.v.vi-p2.1"></span>The</span> belly when filled with all kinds
of food gives birth to seeds of wantonness, nor can the mind, when
choked with the weight of food, keep the guidance and government of the
thoughts. For not only is drunkenness with wine wont to intoxicate the
mind, but excess of all kinds of food makes it weak and uncertain, and
robs it of all its power of pure and clear contemplation. The cause of
the overthrow and wantonness of Sodom was not drunkenness through wine,
but fulness of bread. Hear the Lord rebuking Jerusalem through the
prophet. “For how did thy sister Sodom sin, except in that she ate her
bread in fulness and abundance?” <span id="fr_827"></span>[828](#fn_827.md)
And because through fulness of bread they were inflamed with
uncontrollable lust of the flesh, they were burnt up by the judgment of
God with fire and brimstone from heaven. But if excess of bread alone
<span id="page_236">p. 236</span> <span
id="iv.iii.v.vi-Page_236"></span>drove them to such a headlong downfall
into sin through the vice of satiety, what shall we think of those who
with a vigorous body dare to partake of meat and wine with unbounded
licence, taking not just what their bodily frailty demands, but what the
eager desire of the mind suggests.
