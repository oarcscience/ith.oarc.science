anchorites which by God’s help have been set forth although in plain and
unadorned style, the course of our narration compels us to insert and
find a place for something, which may seem so to speak to cause a
blemish on a fair body: although I have no doubt that by it no small
instruction on the image of Almighty God of which we read in Genesis
will be conferred on some of the simpler sort, especially when the
grounds are considered of a doctrine so important that men cannot be
ignorant of it without terrible blasphemy and serious harm to the
Catholic faith.
