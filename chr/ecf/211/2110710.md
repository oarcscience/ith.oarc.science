#### <span id="iv.iv.viii.i-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.

<span id="iv.iv.viii.i-p1"></span>On the chastity of Abbot
Serenus. <span id="fr_1435"></span>[1436](#fn_1435)

<span id="iv.iv.viii.i-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.viii.i-p3.1"></span>As</span> we desire to introduce to
earnest minds the Abbot Serenus, a man of the greatest holiness and
continence, and one who answers like a mirror to his name, whom we
admired above all others with peculiar veneration, we think that we only
carry out our desire by the attempt to insert his conferences in our
book. To this man beyond all other virtues, which shone forth not merely
in his actions and manners, but by God’s grace in his very look as well,
there was granted by a special blessing the gift of continence, so that
he never felt himself disturbed even by natural incitements even in
sleep. And how it was that by the assistance of God’s grace he attained
such wondrous purity of the flesh, as it seems beyond the conditions of
human nature, I think that I ought first of all to explain.
