#### <span id="iv.iv.ix.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.

<span id="iv.iv.ix.iii-p1"></span>The answer on the many kinds of food
provided in holy Scripture.

<span id="iv.iv.ix.iii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.ix.iii-p2.1"></span>Serenus</span>: The authority of holy
Scripture says on those points on which it would inform us some things
so plainly and clearly even to those who are utterly void of
understanding, that not only are they not veiled in the obscurity of any
hidden meaning, but do not even require the help of any explanation, but
carry their meaning and sense on the surface of the words and letters:
but some things are so concealed and involved in mysteries as to offer
us an immense field for skill and care in the discussion and explanation
of them. And it is clear that God has so ordered it for many reasons:
first for fear lest the holy mysteries, if they were covered by no veil
of spiritual meaning, should be exposed equally to the knowledge and
understanding of everybody, i.e., the profane as well as the faithful
and thus there might be no difference in the matter of goodness and
prudence between the lazy and the earnest: next that among those who are
indeed of the household of faith, while immense differences of
intellectual power open out before them, there might be the opportunity
of reproving the slothfulness of the idle, and of proving the keenness
and diligence of the earnest. And so holy Scripture is fitly compared to
a rich and fertile field, which, while bearing and producing much which
is good for man’s food without being cooked by fire, produces some
things which are found to be unsuitable for man’s use or even harmful
unless they have lost all the roughness of their raw condition by being
tempered and softened down by the heat of fire. But some are naturally
fit for use in both states, so that even when uncooked they are not
unpleasant from their raw condition, but still are rendered more
palatable by being cooked and heated by fire. Many more things too are
produced only fit for the food of irrational creatures, and cattle, and
wild animals and birds, but utterly useless as food for men, which while
still in their rough state without being in any way touched by fire,
conduce to the health and life of cattle. And we can clearly see that
the same system holds good in that most fruitful garden of the
Scriptures of the Spirit, in which some things shine forth clear and
bright in their literal sense, in such a way that while they have no
need of any higher interpretation, they furnish abundant food and
nourishment in the simple sound of the words, to the hearers: as in this
passage: “Hear, O Israel, the Lord thy God is one Lord;” and: “Thou
shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul,
and with all thy strength.” <span id="fr_1518"></span>[1519](#fn_1518.md)
But there are some which, unless they are weakened down by an
allegorical interpretation, and softened by the trial of the fire of the
spirit cannot become wholesome food for the inner man without injury and
loss to him; and damage rather than profit will accrue to him from
receiving them: as with this passage: “But let your loins be girded up
and your lights burning;” and: “whosoever has no sword, let him sell his
coat and buy himself a sword;” and: “whosoever taketh not up his cross
and followeth after Me is not worthy of Me;” <span
id="fr_1519"></span>[1520](#fn_1519.md) a passage which some most earnest
monks, having “indeed a zeal for God, but not according to
knowledge” <span id="fr_1520"></span>[1521](#fn_1520.md) understood
literally, and so made themselves wooden crosses, and carried them about
constantly on their shoulders, and so were the cause not of edification
but of ridicule on the part of all who saw them. But some are capable of
being taken suitable and properly in both ways, i.e., the historical and
allegorical, so that either explanation furnishes a healing draught to
the soul; as this passage: “If any one shall smite thee on the right
cheek, turn to him the other also;” and: “when they persecute you in one
city, flee to another;” and: “if thou wilt be perfect, go, sell all that
thou hast and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven,
and come follow Me.” <span id="fr_1521"></span>[1522](#fn_1521.md) It
produces indeed “grass for the cattle” also, (and of this food all the
fields of Scripture are full); viz., plain and simple narratives of
history, by which simple folk, and those who are incapable of perfect
and sound understanding (of whom it is said “Thou, Lord, wilt save both
man and beast”) <span id="fr_1522"></span>[1523](#fn_1522.md) may be made
stronger and more vigorous for their hard work and the labour of actual
life, in accordance with the state and measure of their capacity.
