#### <span id="iv.v.vi.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.

<span id="iv.v.vi.iii-p1"></span>Of a dead man raised to life by Abbot
Macarius.

<span id="iv.v.vi.iii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.vi.iii-p2.1"></span>As</span> also we remember that a dead man
was raised to life by Abbot Macarius who was the first to find a home in
the desert of Scete. <span id="fr_1945"></span>[1946](#fn_1945.md) For when
a certain heretic who followed the error of Eunomius was trying by
dialectic subtlety to destroy the simplicity of the Catholic faith, and
had already deceived a large number of men, the blessed Macarius was
asked by some Catholics, who were terribly disturbed by the horror of
such an upset, to set free the simple folk of all Egypt from the peril
of infidelity, and came for this purpose. And when the heretic had
approached him with his dialectic art, and wanted to drag him away in
his ignorance to the thorns of Aristotle, the blessed Macarius put a
stop to his chatter with apostolic brevity, saying: “the kingdom of God
is not in word but in power.” <span id="fr_1946"></span>[1947](#fn_1946.md)
Let us go therefore to the tombs, and let us invoke the name of the Lord
over the first dead man we find, and let us, as it is written, “show our
faith by our works,” <span id="fr_1947"></span>[1948](#fn_1947.md) that by
His testimony the manifest proofs of a right faith may be shown, and we
may prove the clear truth not by an empty discussion of words but by the
power of miracles and that judgment which cannot be deceived. And when
he heard this the heretic was overwhelmed with shame before the people
who were present, and pretended for the moment that he consented to the
terms proposed, and promised that he would come on the morrow, but the
next day when they were <span id="page_447">p. 447</span> <span
id="iv.v.vi.iii-Page_447"></span>all in expectation who had come
together with greater eagerness to the appointed place, owing to their
desire for the spectacle, he was terrified by the consciousness of his
want of faith, and fled away, and at once escaped out of all Egypt. And
when the blessed Macarius had waited together with the people till the
ninth hour, and saw that he had owing to his guilty conscience avoided
him, he took the people, who had been perverted by him and went to the
tombs determined upon. Now in Egypt the overflow of the river Nile has
introduced this custom that, since the whole breadth of that country is
covered for no small part of the year by the regular flood of waters
like a great sea so that there is no means of getting about except by a
passage in boats, the bodies of the dead are embalmed and stored away in
cells an good height up. For the soil of that land being damp from the
continual moisture prevents them from burying them. For if it receives
any bodies buried in it, it is forced by the excessive inundations to
cast them forth on its surface. When then the blessed Macarius had taken
up his position by a most ancient corpse, he said “O man, if that
heretic and son of perdition had come hither with me, and, while he was
standing by, I had exclaimed and invoked the name of Christ my God, say
in the presence of these who were almost perverted by his fraud, whether
you would have arisen.” Then he arose and replied with words of assent.
And then Abbot Macarius asked him what he had formerly been when he
enjoyed life here, or in what age of men he had lived, or if he had then
known the name of Christ, and he replied that he had lived under kings
of most ancient date, and declared that in those days he had never heard
the name of Christ. To whom once more Abbot Macarius: “Sleep,” said he,
“in peace with the others in your own order, to be roused again by
Christ in the end.” All this power then and grace of his which was in
him would perhaps have always been hidden, unless the needs of the whole
province which was endangered, and his entire devotion to Christ, and
unfeigned love, had forced him to perform this miracle. And certainly it
was not the ostentation of glory but the love of Christ and the good of
all the people that wrung from him the performance of it. As the passage
in the book of Kings shows us that the blessed Elijah also did, who
asked that fire might descend from heaven on the sacrifices laid on the
pyre, for this reason that he might set free the faith of the whole
people which was endangered by the tricks of the false prophets.

<span id="iv.v.vi.iii-p3"></span> This was the “Egyptian,” not the
“Alexandrian” Macarius. See the note on the Institutes, V. xli. The
story is also given by Rufinus, History of the Monks, c. xxviii.; as
well as Sozomen, H.E. III. xiv., and by both of these writers is
expressly ascribed to the Egyptian Macarius.
