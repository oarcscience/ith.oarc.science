#### <span id="ii.iv.i.xx-p0.1"></span>Chapter XX.

<span id="ii.iv.i.xx-p1"></span>“<span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.i.xx-p1.1"></span>I will</span>, however, still further give
you an account of two extraordinary marvels. The one of these will be a
notable warning against the inflation of wretched vanity, and the other
will serve as no mean guard against the display of a spurious
righteousness.

<span id="ii.iv.i.xx-p2"></span>“A certain saint, then, endowed with
almost incredible power in casting out demons from the bodies of those
possessed by them, was, day by day, performing unheard-of miracles. For,
not only when present, and not merely by his word, but while absent
also, he, from time to time, cured possessed bodies, by some threads
taken from his garment, or by letters which he sent. He, therefore, was
to a wonderful degree visited by people who came to him from every part
of the world. I say nothing about those of humbler rank; but prefects,
courtiers, and judges of various ranks often lay at his doors. Most holy
bishops also, laying aside their priestly dignity, and humbly imploring
him to touch and bless them, believed with good reason that they were
sanctified, and illumined with a divine gift, as often as they touched
his hand and garment. He was reported to abstain always and utterly from
every kind of drink, and for food (I will whisper this, Sulpitius, into
your ear lest <span id="page_34">p. 34</span> <span
id="ii.iv.i.xx-Page_34"></span>our friend the Gaul hear it), to subsist
upon only six dried figs. But in the meantime, just as honor accrued to
the holy man from his excellence, <span
id="fr_105"></span>[106](#fn_105.md) so vanity began to steal upon him from
the honor which was paid him. When first he perceived that this evil was
growing upon him, he struggled long and earnestly to shake it off, but
it could not be thoroughly got rid of by all his efforts, since he still
had a secret consciousness of being under the influence of vanity.
Everywhere did the demons acknowledge his name, while he was not able to
exclude from his presence the number of people who flocked to him. The
hidden poison was, in the meantime, working in his breast, and he, at
whose beck demons were expelled from the bodies of others, was quite
unable to cleanse himself from the hidden thoughts of vanity. Betaking
himself, therefore, with fervent supplication to God, he is said to have
prayed that, power being given to the devil over him for five months, he
might become like to those whom he himself had cured. Why should I delay
with many words? That most powerful man,—he, renowned for his miracles
and virtues through all the East, he, to whose threshold multitudes had
gathered, and at whose door the highest dignitaries of that age had
prostrated themselves—laid hold of by a demon, was kept fast in chains.
It was only after having suffered all those things which the possessed
are wont to endure, that at length in the fifth month he was delivered,
not only from the demon, but (what was to him more useful and desirable)
from the vanity which had dwelt within him.
