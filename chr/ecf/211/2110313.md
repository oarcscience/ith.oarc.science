#### <span id="iv.iii.ii.xvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVI.

<span id="iv.iii.ii.xvi-p1"></span>How no one is allowed to pray with
one who has been suspended from prayer.

<span id="iv.iii.ii.xvi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.ii.xvi-p2.1"></span>Further</span>, if one of them has been
suspended from prayer for some fault which he has committed, no one has
any liberty of praying with him before he performs his penance on the
ground, <span id="fr_708"></span>[709](#fn_708.md) and reconciliation and
pardon for his offence has been publicly granted to him by the Abbot
before all the brethren. For by a plan of this kind they separate and
cut themselves off from fellowship with him in prayer for this
reason—because they believe that one who is suspended from prayer is, as
the Apostle says, “delivered unto Satan:” <span
id="fr_709"></span>[710](#fn_709.md) and if any one, moved by an
ill-considered affection, dares to hold communion with him in prayer
before he has been received by the elder, he makes himself partaker of
his damnation, and delivers himself up of his own free will to Satan, to
whom the other had been consigned for the correction of his guilt. And
in this he falls into a more grievous offence because, by uniting with
him in fellowship either in talk or in prayer, he gives him grounds for
still greater arrogance, and only encourages and makes worse the
obstinacy of the offender. For, by <span id="page_212">p. 212</span>
<span id="iv.iii.ii.xvi-Page_212"></span>giving him a consolation that
is only hurtful, he will make his heart still harder, and not let him
humble himself for the fault for which he was excommunicated; and
through this he will make him hold the Elder’s rebuke as of no
consequence, and harbour deceitful thoughts about satisfaction and
absolution.
