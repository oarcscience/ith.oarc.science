#### <span id="iv.iii.ii.xii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XII.

<span id="iv.iii.ii.xii-p1"></span>Of the reason why while one sings the
Psalms the rest sit down during the service; and of the zeal with which
they afterwards prolong their vigils in their cells till daybreak.

<span id="iv.iii.ii.xii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.ii.xii-p2.1"></span>This</span> canonical system of twelve
Psalms, of which we have spoken, they render easier by such bodily rest
that when, after their custom, they celebrate these services, they all,
except the one who stands up in the midst to recite the Psalms, sit in
very low stalls and follow the voice of the singer with the utmost
attention of heart. For they are so worn out with fasting and working
all day and night that, unless they were helped by some such indulgence,
they could not possibly get through this number standing up. For they
allow no time to pass idly without the performance of some work, because
not only do they strive with all earnestness to do with their hands
those things which can be done in daylight, but also with anxious minds
they examine into those sorts of work which not even the darkness of
night can put a stop to, as they hold that they will gain a far deeper
insight into subjects of spiritual contemplation with purity of heart,
the more earnestly that they devote themselves to work and labour. And
therefore they consider that a moderate allowance of canonical prayers
was divinely arranged in order that for those who are very ardent in
faith room might be left in which their never-tiring flow of virtue
might spend itself, and notwithstanding no loathing arise in their
wearied and weak bodies from too large a quantity. And so, when the
offices of the canonical prayers have been duly finished, every one
returns to his own cell (which he inhabits alone, or is allowed to share
with only one other whom partnership in work or training in discipleship
and learning has joined with him, or perhaps similarity of character has
made his companion), and again they offer with greater earnestness the
same service of prayer, as their special private sacrifice, as it were;
nor do any of them give themselves up any further to rest and sleep till
when the brightness of day comes on the labours of the day succeed the
labours and meditations of the night.
