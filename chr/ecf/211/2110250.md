#### <span id="iii.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter VIII.

<span id="iii.ix-p1"></span>Exposition of St. Paul’s Words, [Gal. i.
8](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#008.md)<span id="iii.ix-p1.1"></span>.

<span id="iii.ix-p2"></span>\[21.\] <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.ix-p2.1"></span>When</span> therefore certain of this sort
wandering about provinces and cities, and carrying with them their venal
errors, had found their way to Galatia, and when the Galatians, on
hearing them, nauseating the truth, and vomiting up the manna of
Apostolic and Catholic doctrine, were delighted with the garbage of
heretical novelty, the apostle putting in exercise the authority of his
office, delivered his sentence with the utmost severity, “Though we,” he
says, “or an angel from heaven, preach any other Gospel unto you than
that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.” <span
id="fr_456"></span>[457](#fn_456.md)

<span id="iii.ix-p4"></span>\[22.\] Why does he say “Though we”? why not
rather “though I”? He means, “though Peter, though Andrew, though John,
<span id="page_137">p. 137</span> <span id="iii.ix-Page_137"></span>in a
word, though the whole company of apostles, preach unto you other than
we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.” Tremendous severity! He
spares neither himself nor his fellow apostles, so he may preserve
unaltered the faith which was at first delivered. Nay, this is not all.
He goes on “Even though an angel from heaven preach unto you any other
Gospel than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.”
It was not enough for the preservation of the faith once delivered to
have referred to man; he must needs comprehend angels also. “Though we,”
he says, “or an angel from heaven.” Not that the holy angels of heaven
are now capable of sinning. But what he means is: Even if that were to
happen which cannot happen,—if any one, be he who he may, attempt to
alter the faith once for all delivered, let him be accursed.

<span id="iii.ix-p5"></span>\[23.\] But it may be, he spoke thus in the
first instance inconsiderately, giving vent to human impetuosity rather
than expressing himself under divine guidance. Far from it. He follows
up what he had said, and urges it with intense reiterated earnestness,
“As we said before, so say I now again, If any man preach any other
Gospel to you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.” He does
not say, “If any man deliver to you another message than that you have
received, let him be blessed, praised, welcomed,”—no; but “let him be
accursed,” \[anathema\] i.e., separated, segregated, excluded, lest the
dire contagion of a single sheep contaminate the guiltless flock of
Christ by his poisonous intermixture with them.
