#### <span id="iv.v.ii.xi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XI.

<span id="iv.v.ii.xi-p1"></span>A question why he has called the feeling
of fear and hope imperfect.

<span id="iv.v.ii.xi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.ii.xi-p2.1"></span>Germanus</span>: You have indeed spoken
powerfully and grandly of the perfect love of God. But still this fact
disturbs us; viz., that while you were exalting it with such praise, you
said that the fear of God and the hope of eternal reward were imperfect,
though the prophet seems to have thought quite differently about them,
where he said: “Fear the Lord, all ye His saints, for they that fear Him
lack nothing.” <span id="fr_1716"></span>[1717](#fn_1716.md) And again in
the matter of observing God’s righteous acts he admits that he has done
them from consideration of the reward, saying: “I have inclined my heart
to do thy righteous acts forever, for the reward.” <span
id="fr_1717"></span>[1718](#fn_1717.md) And the Apostle says: “By faith
Moses when he <span id="page_420">p. 420</span> <span
id="iv.v.ii.xi-Page_420"></span>was grown up, denied himself to be the
son of Pharaoh’s daughter; choosing rather to be afflicted with the
people of God than to have the pleasure of sin for a season, esteeming
the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasure of the
Egyptians; for he looked unto the reward.” <span
id="fr_1718"></span>[1719](#fn_1718.md) How then can we think that they are
imperfect, if the blessed David boasted that he did the righteous acts
of God in hope of a recompense, and the giver of the Law is said to have
looked for a future reward and so to have despised the adoption to royal
dignity, and to have preferred the most terrible affliction to the
treasures of the Egyptians?
