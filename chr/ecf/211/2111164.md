#### <span id="iv.vii.vii.xiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIII.

<span id="iv.vii.vii.xiii-p1"></span>He replies to the objection in
which they say that the child born <span
id="fr_2562"></span>[2563](#fn_2562) *ought to be of one substance with
the mother.*

<span id="iv.vii.vii.xiii-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.vii.xiii-p3.1"></span>But</span> indeed in your deceit and
blasphemy you use a grand argument for denying and attacking the Lord
God, when you say that “the child born ought to be of one substance with
the mother.” <span id="fr_2563"></span>[2564](#fn_2563) I do not
entirely admit it, and maintain that in the matter of the birth of God
it would not be observed; for the birth was not so much the work of her
who bore Him as of her Son, and He was born as He willed, whose doing it
was that He was born. Next, if you say that the child born ought to be
of one substance with the parent, I affirm that the Lord Jesus Christ
was of one substance with His Father, and also with His mother. For in
accordance with the difference of the Persons He showed a likeness to
each parent. For according to His Divinity He was of one substance with
the Father: but according to the flesh He was of one substance with His
mother. Not that it was one Person who was of one substance with the
Father, and another who was of one substance with His mother, but
because the same Lord Jesus Christ, both born as man, and also being
God, had in Him the properties of each parent, and in that He was man He
showed a likeness to His human mother, and in that He was God He
possessed the very nature of God the Father.
