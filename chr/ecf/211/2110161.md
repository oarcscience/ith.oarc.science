#### <span id="ii.vi.i.xxvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXVII.

<span id="ii.vi.i.xxvii-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.vi.i.xxvii-p1.1"></span>The</span> Israelites yet again turned to
idols; and, being deprived of the divine protection, were subdued by the
Philistines, and paid the penalty of their unfaithfulness by forty years
of captivity. At that time, Samson is related to have been born. His
mother, after being long barren, had a vision of an angel, and was told
to abstain from wine, and strong drink, and everything unclean; for that
she should bear a son who would be the restorer of liberty to the
Israelites, and their avenger upon their enemies. He, with unshorn
locks, is said to have been possessed of marvelous strength, so much so
that he tore to pieces with his hands a lion which met him in the way.
He had a wife from the Philistines, and when she, in the absence of her
husband, had entered into marriage with another, he, through indignation
on account of his wife being thus taken from him, wrought destruction to
her nation. Trusting in God and his own strength, he openly brought
disaster on those hitherto victors. For, catching three hundred foxes,
he tied burning torches to their tails, and sent them into the fields of
the enemy. It so happened that at the time the harvest was ripe, and
thus the fire easily caught, while the vines and olive-trees were burnt
to ashes. He was thus seen to have avenged the injury done him in taking
away his wife, by a great loss inflicted on the Philistines. And they,
enraged at this disaster, destroyed by fire the woman who had been the
cause of so great a calamity, along with her house and her father. But
Samson, thinking himself as yet but poorly avenged, ceased not to harass
the heathen race with all sorts of evil devices. Then the Jews, being
compelled to it, handed him over as a prisoner to the Philistines; but,
when thus handed over, he burst his bonds and seizing the jaw-bone <span
id="fr_292"></span>[293](#fn_292.md) of an ass, which chance offered him as
a weapon, he slew a thousand of his enemies. And, as the heat of the day
grew violent, and he began to suffer from thirst, he called upon God,
and water flowed forth from <span id="fr_293"></span>[294](#fn_293.md) the
bone which he held in his hand.

<span id="fn_292"></span>[84:293](2110161.htm#fr_292.md) <span
id="ii.vi.i.xxvii-p1.2"></span>

<span id="ii.vi.i.xxvii-p2"></span> Simply “osse asini” in text.

<span id="fn_293"></span>[84:294](2110161.htm#fr_293.md) <span
id="ii.vi.i.xxvii-p2.1"></span>

<span id="ii.vi.i.xxvii-p3"></span> This is clearly the meaning, and
Halm’s punctuation, “invocato Deo ex osse, quod manu tenebat, aqua
fluxit,” is obviously wrong.
