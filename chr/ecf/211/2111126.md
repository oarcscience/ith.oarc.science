#### <span id="iv.vii.v.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.

<span id="iv.vii.v.v-p1"></span>How in virtue of the hypostatic union of
the two natures in Christ the Word is rightly termed the Saviour, or
incarnate man, and the Son of God.

<span id="iv.vii.v.v-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.v.v-p2.1"></span>And</span> so it is clear that through the
mystery of the Word of God joined to man, the Word, which was sent to
save men, can be termed Saviour, and the Saviour, who was born in the
flesh, can through union with the Word be called the Son of God; and so
through the indifferent use of either title, since God is joined to man,
whatever is God and man, can be termed altogether God. <span
id="fr_2455"></span>[2456](#fn_2455.md) And so the same Apostle well adds
the words: “Whoever believeth that Jesus is the Son of God, God abideth
in him, and the love of God is perfected in him.” <span
id="fr_2456"></span>[2457](#fn_2456.md) He tells us that *he* believes, and
declares that *he* is filled with divine love, who believes that Jesus
is the Son of God. But he testifies that the Word of God is the Son of
God, and thus means us fully to understand that the only begotten Word
of God, and Jesus Christ the Son of God are one and the same Person. But
do you want to be told more fully that,—though Christ according to the
flesh was truly born as man of man,—yet in virtue of the ineffable unity
of the mystery, by which man was joined to God, there is no separation
between Christ and the Word? Hear the gospel of the Lord, or rather hear
the Lord <span id="page_576">p. 576</span> <span
id="iv.vii.v.v-Page_576"></span>Himself saying of Himself: <span
id="fr_2457"></span>[2458](#fn_2457.md) “This,” says He, “is life eternal,
that they may know Thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom Thou
hast sent.” <span id="fr_2458"></span>[2459](#fn_2458.md) You heard above
that the Word of God was sent to heal mankind: here you are told that He
who was sent is Jesus Christ. Separate this, if you can,—though you see
that so great is the unity of Christ and the Word, that it was not
merely that Christ was united with the Word, but that in virtue of the
actual unity \[of Person\] Christ may even be said to be the Word.

<span id="iv.vii.v.v-p3"></span> Cf. Hooker Eccl: Polity., Book V. c.
liii. § 4. “A kind of mutual commutation there is whereby those concrete
names, God and man, when we speak of Christ, do take interchangeably one
another’s room, so that for truth of speech it skilleth not whether we
say that the Son of God hath created the world, and the Son of man by
His death hath saved it, or else that the Son of man did create, and the
Son of God die to save the world. Howbeit as oft as we attribute to God
what the manhood of Christ claimeth, or to man what His Deity hath right
unto, we understand by the name of God and the name of man neither the
one nor the other nature, but the whole person of Christ, in whom both
natures are.” The technical phrase by which this interchange of names is
described is the Communicatio idiomatum, and in Greek <span
