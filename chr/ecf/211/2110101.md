#### <span id="ii.v.i.i-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.

<span id="ii.v.i.i-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.i.i-p1.1"></span>On</span> reading your letters, my feelings
were, in many ways, deeply moved, and I could not refrain from tears.
For I both wept for joy because I could perceive from the very language
of your letters, that you were living according to the precepts of the
Lord God, and out of my exceeding desire after you, I could not help
lamenting that, without any fault on my part, I was parted from you; and
I would have felt this still more strongly had you not sent me a letter.
Should I not, then, enjoy the company of such a sister? But I call your
salvation to witness, that I have very often wished to come to you, but
have up till now been prevented, through the opposition of him <span
id="fr_138"></span>[139](#fn_138) who is accustomed to hinder us. For,
in my eager desire, I was both urgent to satisfy my wishes by seeing
you; and we seemed, if we should meet, likely to accomplish more
effectually the work of the Lord, since by comforting one another we
should live with the heavy load of this world trodden under our feet.
But I do not now fix the day or time of visiting you, because, as often
as I have done so, I have not been able to fulfil my purpose. I shall
wait on the will of the Lord, and hope that, by my supplications and
your prayers, he may bring it about that we reap some advantage from our
perseverance. <span id="fr_139"></span>[140](#fn_139)

<span id="ii.v.i.i-p2"></span> It is obvious that, in this whole
passage, Sulpitius has in his mind the language of St. Paul, [Rom. i.
9-12](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#009)<span id="ii.v.i.i-p2.1"></span>.

<span id="fn_139"></span>[55:140](2110101.htm#fr_139) <span
id="ii.v.i.i-p2.2"></span>

<span id="ii.v.i.i-p3"></span> Halm reads *præsentia*, instead of the
old reading *perseverantia*\`, but apparently without good grounds.
