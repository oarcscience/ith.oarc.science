#### <span id="iv.iv.vii.xv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XV.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xv-p1"></span>How one loses by going away from one’s
cell.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.vii.xv-p2.1"></span>And</span> so we ought always to remain
shut up in our cell. For whenever a man has strayed from it and returns
fresh to it and begins again to live there he will be upset and
disturbed. For if he has let it go he cannot without difficulty and
pains recover that fixed purpose of mind, which he had gained when he
remained in his cell; and as through this he has gone back, he will not
think anything of the advance which he has missed, and which he would
have secured if he had not allowed himself to leave his cell, but he
will rather congratulate himself if he finds that he has regained that
condition from which he fell away. For just as time once lost and gone
cannot any more be recovered, so neither can those advantages which have
been missed be restored: for whatever earnest purpose of the mind there
may be afterwards, it will be the profit of the day then present, and
the gain that belongs to the time that then is, and will not make up for
the gain that has been once for all lost.
