#### <span id="iv.v.vii.xxviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXVIII.

<span id="iv.v.vii.xxviii-p1"></span>How friendships entered upon by
conspiracy cannot be lasting ones.

<span id="iv.v.vii.xxviii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.vii.xxviii-p2.1"></span>This</span> too has been often proved
by many experiments; viz., that those who entered the bonds of
friendship from a beginning of conspiracy, cannot possibly preserve
their harmony unbroken; either because they tried to keep it not out of
their desire for perfection nor because of the sway of Apostolic love,
but out of earthly love, and because of their wants and the bonds of
their agreement; or else because that most crafty foe of ours hurries
them on the more speedily to break the chains of their friendship in
order that he may make them breakers of their oath. This opinion then of
the most prudent men is most certainly established; viz., that true
harmony and undivided union can only exist among those whose life is
pure, and who are men of the same goodness and purpose.

<span id="iv.v.vii.xxviii-p3"></span>Thus much the blessed Joseph
discoursed in his spiritual talk on friendship, and fired us with a more
ardent desire to preserve the love of our fellowship as a lasting one.
