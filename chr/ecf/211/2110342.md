#### <span id="iv.iii.iv.xiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIII.

<span id="iv.iii.iv.xiii-p1"></span>How wrong it is considered for any
one to say that anything, however trifling, is his own.

<span id="iv.iii.iv.xiii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.iv.xiii-p2.1"></span>Among</span> their other practices I
fancy that it is unnecessary even to mention this virtue, viz., that no
one is allowed to possess a box or basket as his special property, nor
any such thing which he could keep as his own and secure with his own
seal, as we are well aware that they are in all respects stripped so
bare that they have nothing whatever except their shirt, cloak, shoes,
sheepskin, and rush mat; <span id="fr_767"></span>[768](#fn_767) for in
other monasteries as well, where some indulgence and relaxation is
granted, we see that this rule is still most strictly kept, so that no
one ventures to say even in word that anything is his own: and it is a
great offence if there drops from the mouth of a monk such an expression
as “my book,” “my tablets,” “my pen,” “my coat,” or “my shoes;” and for
this he would have to make satisfaction by a proper penance, if by
accident some such expression escaped his lips through thoughtlessness
or ignorance.

served as a seat by day and a bed by night for the monks. See Book V.
xxxv., and the Conferences I. xxiii.; XV. i.; XVII. iii.; XVIII. xi. S.
Jerome mentions it in his preface to the Rule of Pachomius as one of the
very few articles contained in the cells of the monks of Tabenna. “They
have nothing in their cells except a mat and what is described below:
two ‘lebitonaria,’ a kind of garment without sleeves which the Egyptian
monks use (the colobium, or shirt), one old one for sleeping or working,
a linen garment and two hoods, a sheepskin, a linen girdle, shoes, and a
staff.”

labour of each, still no one may venture to exceed the moderate limit of
what is appointed as adequate.](2110343)
