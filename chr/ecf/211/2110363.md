#### <span id="iv.iii.iv.xxxiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXIV.

<span id="iv.iii.iv.xxxiv-p1"></span>Of the way in which our
renunciation is nothing but mortification and the image of the
Crucified.

<span id="iv.iii.iv.xxxiv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.iv.xxxiv-p2.1"></span>Renunciation</span> is nothing but the
evidence of the cross and of mortification. And so you must know that
to-day you are dead to this world and its deeds and desires, and that,
as the Apostle says, you are crucified to this world and this world to
you. <span id="fr_794"></span>[795](#fn_794) Consider therefore the
demands of the cross under the sign <span
id="fr_795"></span>[796](#fn_795) of which you ought henceforward to
live in this life; because *you* no longer live but *He* lives in you
who was crucified for you. <span id="fr_796"></span>[797](#fn_796) We
must therefore pass our time in this life in that fashion and form in
which He was crucified for us on the cross so that (as David says)
piercing our flesh with the fear of the Lord, <span
id="fr_797"></span>[798](#fn_797) we may have all our wishes and desires
not subservient to our own lusts but fastened to His mortification. For
so shall we fulfil the command of the Lord which says: “He that taketh
not up his cross and followeth me is not worthy of me.” <span
id="fr_798"></span>[799](#fn_798) But perhaps you will say: How can a
man carry his cross continually? or how can any one who is alive be
crucified? Hear briefly how this is.
