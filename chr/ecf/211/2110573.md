#### <span id="iv.iv.ii.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.

<span id="iv.iv.ii.vi-p1"></span>Of those who in renouncing the world,
aim at perfection without love.

<span id="iv.iv.ii.vi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.ii.vi-p2.1"></span>For</span> hence it arises that in the case
of some who have despised the greatest possessions of this world, and
not only large sums of gold and silver, but also large properties, we
have seen them afterwards disturbed and excited over a knife, or pencil,
or pin, or pen. Whereas if they kept their gaze steadily fixed out of a
pure heart they would certainly never allow such a thing to happen for
trifles, while in order that they might not suffer it in the case of
great and precious riches they chose rather to renounce them altogether.
For often too some guard their books so jealously that they will not
allow them to be even slightly moved or touched by any one else, and
from this fact they meet with occasions of impatience and death, which
give them warning of the need of acquiring the requisite patience and
love; and when they have given up all their wealth for the love of
Christ, yet as they preserve their former disposition in the matter of
trifles, and are sometimes quickly upset about them, they become in all
points barren and unfruitful, as those who are without the charity of
which the Apostle speaks: and this the blessed Apostle foresaw in
spirit, and “though,” says he, “I give all my goods to feed the poor,
and give my body to be burned, but have not charity, it profiteth me
nothing.” <span id="fr_1089"></span>[1090](#fn_1089.md) And from this it
clearly follows that perfection is not arrived at simply by self-denial,
and the giving up of all our goods, and the casting away of honours,
unless there is that charity, the details of which the Apostle
describes, which consists in purity of heart alone. For “not to be
envious,” “not to be puffed up, not to be angry, not to do any wrong,
not to seek one’s own, not to rejoice in iniquity, not to think evil”
etc., what is all this except ever to offer to God a perfect and clean
heart, and to keep it free from all disturbances?
