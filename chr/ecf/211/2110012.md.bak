#### <span id="ii.ii.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter VIII.

<span id="ii.ii.ix-p1"></span>Martin restores one that had been
strangled.

<span id="ii.ii.ix-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.ii.ix-p2.1"></span>Not</span> long after these events, while
Martin was passing by the estate of a certain man named Lupicinus, who
was held in high esteem according to the judgment of the world, he was
received with shouting and the lamentations of a wailing crowd. Having,
in an anxious state of mind gone up to that multitude, and enquired what
such weeping meant, he was told that one of the slaves of the family had
put an end to his life by hanging. Hearing this, Martin entered the cell
in which the body was lying, and, excluding all the multitude, he
stretched himself upon the body, and spent some little time in prayer.
Ere long, the deceased, with life beaming in his countenance, and with
his drooping eyes fixed on Martin’s face, is aroused; and with a gentle
effort attempting to rise, he laid hold of the right hand of the saintly
man, and by this means stood upon his feet. In this manner, while the
whole multitude looked on, he walked along with Martin to the porch of
the house.
