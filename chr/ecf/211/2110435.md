#### <span id="iv.iii.vii.xix-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIX.

<span id="iv.iii.vii.xix-p1"></span>A saying of S. Basil, the Bishop,
directed against Syncletius. <span id="fr_899"></span>[900](#fn_899.md)

<span id="iv.iii.vii.xix-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.vii.xix-p3.1"></span>There</span> is current a saying of S.
Basil, Bishop of Cæsarea, directed against a certain Syncletius, who was
growing indifferent with the sort of lukewarmness of which we have
spoken; who, though he professed to have renounced this world, had yet
kept back for himself some of his property, not liking to be supported
by the labour of his own hands, and to acquire true humility by
stripping himself and by grinding toil, and the subjection of the
monastery: “You have,” said he, “spoilt Syncletius, and not made a
monk.”

<span id="iv.iii.vii.xix-p2"></span> Petschenig’s text has *Syncletium*
as a proper name. Gazæus, however, thinks that it should be
*Syncleticum*; i.e. <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iii.vii.xix-p2.1"></span>Συγκλητικός</span> or Senator: and in
the saying of S. Basil at the close of the chapter actually reads
(apparently without any <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.vii.xix-p2.2"></span>ms.</span> authority), *Et Senatorem*,
inquit, perdidisti.
