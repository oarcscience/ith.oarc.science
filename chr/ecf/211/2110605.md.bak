been shown to be pleasing to God that we see that this system not
without reason finds a place in holy Scripture, so that the Lord would
not of Himself instruct by the method of a Divine colloquy the lad
Samuel, when chosen for judgment, but suffered him to run once or twice
to the old man, and willed that one whom He was calling to converse with
Him should be taught even by one who had offended God, as he was an old
man, and preferred that he whom He had deemed worthy to be called by Him
should be trained by the Elder in order to test the humility of him who
was called to a Divine office, and to set an example to the younger men
by the manner of his subjection.
