#### <span id="iv.iii.vii.xxv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXV.

<span id="iv.iii.vii.xxv-p1"></span>Of the deaths of Ananias and
Sapphira, and Judas, which they underwent through the impulse of
covetousness.

<span id="iv.iii.vii.xxv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.vii.xxv-p2.1"></span>Lastly</span>, the chief of the
apostles, taught by these instances, and knowing that one who has any
avarice cannot bridle it, and that it cannot be put an end to by a large
or small sum of money, but only by the virtue of renunciation of
everything, punished with death Ananias and Sapphira, who were mentioned
before, because they had kept back something out of their property, that
that death which Judas had voluntarily met with for the sin of betraying
the Lord, they might also undergo for their lying avarice. <span
id="fr_903"></span>[904](#fn_903.md) How closely do the sin and punishment
correspond in each case! In the one case treachery, in the other
falsehood, was the result of covetousness. In the one case the truth is
betrayed, in the other the sin of lying is committed. For though the
issues of their deeds may appear different, yet they coincide in having
one and the same aim. For the one, in order to escape poverty, desired
to take back what he had forsaken; the others, for fear lest they might
become poor, tried to keep back something out of their property, which
they should have either offered to the Apostle in good faith, or have
given entirely to the brethren. And so in each case there follows the
judgment of death; because each sin sprang from the root of
covetousness. And so if against those who did not covet other persons’
goods, but tried to be sparing of their own, and had no desire to
*acquire*, but only the wish to *retain*, there went forth so severe a
sentence, what should we think of those who desire to amass wealth,
without ever having had any of their own, and, making a show of poverty
before men, are before God convicted of being rich, through the passion
of avarice?
