#### <span id="iv.iii.i.ii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.

<span id="iv.iii.i.ii-p1"></span>Of the Monk’s Robe.

<span id="iv.iii.i.ii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.i.ii-p2.1"></span>Let</span> the robe also of the monk be
such as may merely cover the body and prevent the disgrace of nudity,
and keep off harm from cold, not such as may foster the seeds of vanity
and pride; for the same apostle tells us: “Having food and covering,
with these let us be content.” <span id="fr_641"></span>[642](#fn_641.md)
“Covering,” he says, not “raiment,” as is wrongly found in some Latin
copies: that is, what may merely cover the body, not what may please the
fancy by the splendour of the attire; commonplace, so that it may not be
thought remarkable for novelty of colour or fashion among other men of
the same profession; and quite free from anxious carefulness, yet not
discoloured by stains acquired through neglect. Lastly, let them be so
far removed from this world’s fashions as to remain altogether common
property for the use of the servants of God. For whatever is claimed by
one or a few among the servants of God and is not the common property of
the whole body of the brethren alike is either superfluous or vain, and
for that reason to be considered harmful, and affording an appearance of
vanity rather than virtue. And, therefore, whatever models we see were
not taught either by the saints of old who laid the foundations of the
monastic life, or by the fathers of our own time who in their turn keep
up at the present day their customs, these we also should reject as
superfluous and useless: wherefore they utterly disapproved of a robe of
sackcloth as being visible to all and conspicuous, and what from this
very fact will not only confer no benefit on the soul but rather
minister to vanity and pride, and as being inconvenient and unsuitable
for the performance of necessary work for which a monk ought always to
go ready and unimpeded. But even if we hear of some respectable persons
who have been dressed in this garb, a rule for the monasteries is not,
therefore, to be passed by us, nor should the ancient decrees of the
holy fathers be upset because we do not think that a few men, presuming
on the possession of other virtues, are to be blamed even in regard of
those things which they have practised not in accordance with the
Catholic rule. For the opinion of a few ought not to be preferred to or
to interfere with the general rule for all. For we ought to give
unhesitating allegiance and unquestioning obedience, not to those
customs and rules which the will of a few have introduced, but to those
which a long standing antiquity and numbers of the holy fathers have
passed on by an unanimous decision to those that come after. Nor,
indeed, ought this to influence us as a precedent for our daily life,
that Joram, the wicked king of Israel, when surrounded by bands of his
foes, rent his clothes, and is said to have had sackcloth inside
them; <span id="fr_642"></span>[643](#fn_642.md) or that the Ninevites, in
order to mitigate the sentence of God, which had been pronounced against
them by the prophet, were clothed in rough sackcloth. <span
id="fr_643"></span>[644](#fn_643.md) The former is shown to have been
clothed with it secretly underneath, so that unless the upper garment
had been rent it could not possibly have been known by any one, and the
latter tolerated a covering of sackcloth at a time when, since all were
mourning over the approaching destruction of the city and were clothed
with the same garments, none could be accused of ostentation. For where
there is no special difference and all are alike no harm is done. <span

The Greek is <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iii.i.ii-p3.2"></span>σκεπάσματα</span>, for which Jerome’s
version has “quibus tegamur.” Sabbatier gives “victum et vestitum” as
the rendering of the old Latin, but it is often quoted as “victus et
tegumentum” by Augustine. “Alimenta et operimenta” must be Cassian’s own
rendering from the Greek. “Vestimenta,” which he speaks of as being
found in some Latin copies, is not given by Sabbatier at all, though
Jerome quotes the text with “vestimentum” in Ep. ad Titum, III.
