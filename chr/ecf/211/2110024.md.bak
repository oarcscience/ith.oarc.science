#### <span id="ii.ii.xxi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XX.

<span id="ii.ii.xxi-p1"></span>How Martin acted towards the Emperor
Maximus.

<span id="ii.ii.xxi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.ii.xxi-p2.1"></span>And</span> here to insert some smaller
matters among things so great (although such is the nature of our times
in which all things have fallen into decay and corruption, it is almost
a pre-eminent virtue for priestly firmness not to have yielded to royal
flattery), when a number of bishops from various parts had assembled to
the Emperor Maximus, a man of fierce character, and at that time elated
with the victory he had won in the civil wars, and when the disgraceful
flattery of all around the emperor was generally remarked, while the
priestly dignity had, with degenerate submissiveness, taken a second
place to the royal retinue, in Martin alone, apostolic authority
continued to assert itself. For even if he had to make suit to the
sovereign for some things, he commanded rather than entreated him; and
although often invited, he kept away from his entertainments, saying
that he could not take a place at the table of one who, out of two
emperors, had deprived one of his kingdom, and the other of his life. At
last, when Maximus maintained that he had not of his own accord assumed
the sovereignty, but that he had simply defended by arms the necessary
requirements <span id="fr_33"></span>[34](#fn_33.md) of the empire, regard
to which had been imposed upon him by the soldiers, according to the
Divine appointment, and that the favor of God did not seem wanting to
him who, by an event seemingly so incredible, had secured the victory,
adding to that the statement that none of his adversaries had been slain
except in the open field of battle, at length, Martin, overcome either
by his reasoning or his entreaties, came to the royal banquet. The king
was wonderfully pleased because he had gained this point. Moreover,
there were guests present who had been invited as if to a festival; men
of the highest and most illustrious rank,—the prefect, who was also
consul, named Evodius, one of the most righteous men that ever lived;
two courtiers possessed of the greatest power, the brother and uncle of
the king, while between these two, the presbyter of Martin had taken his
place; but he himself occupied a seat which was set quite close to the
king. About the middle of the banquet, according to custom, one of the
servants presented a goblet to the king. He orders it rather to be given
to the very holy bishop, expecting and hoping that he should then
receive the cup from his right hand. But Martin, when he had drunk,
handed the goblet to his own presbyter, as thinking no one worthier to
drink next to himself, and holding that it would not be right for him to
prefer either the king himself, or those who were next the king, to the
presbyter. And the emperor, as well as all those who were then present,
admired this conduct so much, that this very thing, by which they had
been undervalued, gave them pleasure. The report then ran through the
whole palace that Martin had done, at the king’s dinner, what no bishop
had dared to do <span id="page_14">p. 14</span> <span
id="ii.ii.xxi-Page_14"></span>at the banquets of the lowest judges. And
Martin predicted to the same Maximus long before, that if he went into
Italy to which he then desired to go, waging war, against the Emperor
Valentinianus, it would come to pass that he should know he would <span
id="fr_34"></span>[35](#fn_34.md) indeed be victorious in the first attack,
but would perish a short time afterwards. And we have seen that this did
in fact take place. For, on his first arrival Valentinianus had to
betake himself to flight but recovering his strength about a year
afterwards, Maximus was taken and slain by him within the walls of
Aquileia.

<span id="ii.ii.xxi-p3"></span> “Regni necessitatem”—an awkward
