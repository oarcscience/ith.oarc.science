#### <span id="iv.vi.iv.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VIII.

<span id="iv.vi.iv.viii-p1"></span>Of the various fruits of penitence.

<span id="iv.vi.iv.viii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.viii-p2.1"></span>For</span> after that grace of baptism
which is common to all, and that most precious gift of martyrdom which
is gained by being washed in blood, there are many fruits of penitence
by which we can succeed in expiating our sins. For eternal salvation is
not only promised to the bare fact of penitence, of which the blessed
Apostle Peter says: “Repent and be converted that your sins may be
forgiven;” and John the Baptist and the Lord Himself: “Repent ye, for
the kingdom of heaven is at hand:” <span
id="fr_2127"></span>[2128](#fn_2127.md) but also by the affection of love
is the weight of our sins overwhelmed: for “charity covers a multitude
of sins.” <span id="fr_2128"></span>[2129](#fn_2128.md) In the same way
also by the fruits of almsgiving a remedy is provided for our wounds,
because “As water extinguishes fire, so does almsgiving extinguish
sin.” <span id="fr_2129"></span>[2130](#fn_2129.md) So also by the shedding
of tears is gained the washing away of offences, for “Every night I will
wash my bed: I will water my couch with tears.” Finally to show that
they are not shed in vain, he adds: “Depart from me all ye that <span
id="page_500">p. 500</span> <span
id="iv.vi.iv.viii-Page_500"></span>work iniquity, for the Lord hath
heard the voice of my weeping:” <span
id="fr_2130"></span>[2131](#fn_2130.md) Moreover by means of confession of
sins, their absolution is granted: for “I said: I will confess against
myself my sin to the Lord: and Thou forgavest the iniquity of my heart;”
and again: “Declare thine iniquities first, that thou mayest be
justified.” <span id="fr_2131"></span>[2132](#fn_2131.md) By afflicting the
heart and body also is forgiveness of sins committed in like manner
obtained, for he says: “Look on my humility and my labour, and forgive
me all my sins;” and more especially by amendment of life: “Take away,”
he says, “the evil of your thoughts from mine eyes. Cease to do evil,
learn to do well. Seek judgment, relieve the oppressed: judge the
orphan, defend the widow. And come, reason with Me, saith the Lord: and
though your sins were as scarlet, yet shall they be as white as snow,
though they were red as crimson, they shall be as white as wool.” <span
id="fr_2132"></span>[2133](#fn_2132.md) Sometimes too the pardon of our
sins is obtained by the intercession of the saints, for “if a man knows
his brother to sin a sin not unto death, he asks, and He will give to
him his life, for him that sinneth not unto death;” and again: “Is any
sick among you? Let him send for the Elders of the Church and they shall
pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. And the
prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord will raise him up, and
if he be in sins, they shall be forgiven him.” <span
id="fr_2133"></span>[2134](#fn_2133.md) Sometimes too by the virtue of
compassion and faith the stains of sin are removed, according to this
passage: “By compassion and faith sins are purged away.” <span
id="fr_2134"></span>[2135](#fn_2134.md) And often by the conversion and
salvation of those who are saved by our warnings and preaching: “For he
who converts a sinner from the error of his way, shall save his soul
from death, and cover a multitude of sins.” <span
id="fr_2135"></span>[2136](#fn_2135.md) Moreover by pardon and forgiveness
on our part we obtain pardon of our sins: “For if ye forgive men their
offences, your heavenly Father will also forgive you your sins.” <span
id="fr_2136"></span>[2137](#fn_2136.md) You see then what great means of
obtaining mercy the compassion of our Saviour has laid open to us, so
that no one when longing for salvation need be crushed by despair, as he
sees himself called to life by so many remedies. For if you plead that
owing to weakness of the flesh you cannot get rid of your sins by
fasting, and you cannot say: “My knees are weak from fasting, and my
flesh is changed for oil; for I have eaten ashes for my bread, and
mingled my drink with weeping,” <span
id="fr_2137"></span>[2138](#fn_2137.md) then atone for them by profuse
almsgiving. If you have nothing that you can give to the needy (although
the claims of want and poverty exclude none from this office, since the
two mites of the widow are ranked higher than the splendid gifts of the
rich, and the Lord promises that He will give a reward for a cup of cold
water), at least you can purge them away by amendment of life. But if
you cannot secure perfection in goodness by the eradication of all your
faults, you can show a pious anxiety for the good and salvation of
another. But if you complain that you are not equal to this service, you
can cover your sins by the affection of love. And if in this also some
sluggishness of mind makes you weak, at least you should submissively
with a feeling of humility entreat for remedies for your wounds by the
prayers and intercession of the saints. Finally who is there who cannot
humbly say: “I have acknowledged my sin: and mine unrighteousness have I
not hid;” so that by this confession he may be able also to add this:
“And Thou forgavest the iniquity of my heart.” <span
id="fr_2138"></span>[2139](#fn_2138.md) But if shame holds you back, and
you blush to reveal them before men, you should not cease to confess
them with constant supplication to Him from Whom they cannot be hid, and
to say to Him: “I acknowledge mine iniquity, and my sin is ever before
me. Against Thee only have I sinned, and have done evil before
Thee;” <span id="fr_2139"></span>[2140](#fn_2139.md) as He is wont to heal
them without any publication which brings shame, and to forgive sins
without any reproaching. And further besides that ready and sure aid the
Divine condescension has afforded us another also that is still easier,
and has entrusted the possession of the remedy to our own will, so that
we can infer from our own feelings the forgiveness of our offences, when
we say to Him: “Forgive us our debts as we also forgive our
debtors.” <span id="fr_2140"></span>[2141](#fn_2140.md) Whoever then
desires to obtain forgiveness of his sins, should study to fit himself
for it by these means. Let not the stubbornness of an obdurate heart
turn away any from the saving remedy and the fount of so much goodness,
because even if we have done all these things, they will not be able to
expiate our offences, unless they are blotted out by the goodness and
mercy of the Lord, who when He sees the service of pious efforts offered
by us with a humble heart, supports our small and puny efforts with the
utmost bounty, and says: “I even I am He that blotteth out thine
iniquities for Mine own sake, and I will remember thy sins no
more.” <span id="fr_2141"></span>[2142](#fn_2141.md) Whoever then is aiming
<span id="page_501">p. 501</span> <span
id="iv.vi.iv.viii-Page_501"></span>at this condition, which we have
mentioned, will seek the grace of satisfaction by daily fasting and
mortification of heart and body, for, as it is written, “Without
shedding of blood there is no remission;” <span
id="fr_2142"></span>[2143](#fn_2142.md) and this not without good reason.
For “flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God.” <span
id="fr_2143"></span>[2144](#fn_2143.md) And therefore one who would
withhold “the sword of the spirit which is the word of God” <span
id="fr_2144"></span>[2145](#fn_2144.md) from this shedding of blood
certainly comes under the lash of that curse of Jeremiah’s; for
“Cursed,” says he “is he who withholds his sword from blood.” <span
id="fr_2145"></span>[2146](#fn_2145.md) For this is the sword which for our
good sheds that bad blood whereby the material of our sins lives; and
cuts off and pares away everything carnal and earthly which it finds to
have grown up in the members of our soul; and makes men die to sin and
live to God, and flourish with spiritual virtues. And so he will begin
to weep no more at the recollection of former sins, but at the hope of
what is to come, and, thinking less of past evils than of good things to
come, will shed tears not from sorrow at his sins, but from delight in
that eternal joy, and “forgetting those things which are behind,” i.e.,
carnal sins, will press on “to those before,” <span
id="fr_2146"></span>[2147](#fn_2146.md) i.e., to spiritual gifts and
virtues.
