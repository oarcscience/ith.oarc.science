#### <span id="iv.iii.iv.vii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.

<span id="iv.iii.iv.vii-p1"></span>The reason why those who are admitted
to a monastery are not permitted to mix at once with the congregation of
the brethren, but are first committed to the guest house.

<span id="iv.iii.iv.vii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.iv.vii-p2.1"></span>When</span>, then, any one has been
received and proved by that persistence of which we have spoken, and,
laying aside his own garments, has been clad in those of the monastery,
he is not allowed to mix at once with the congregation of the brethren,
but is given into the charge of an Elder, who lodges apart not far from
the entrance of the monastery, and is entrusted with the care of
strangers and guests, and bestows all his diligence in receiving them
kindly. And when he has served there for a whole year without any
complaint, and has given evidence of service towards strangers, <span
id="fr_760"></span>[761](#fn_760.md) being thus initiated in the first
rudiments <span id="page_221">p. 221</span> <span
id="iv.iii.iv.vii-Page_221"></span>of humility and patience, and by long
practice in it acknowledged, when he is to be admitted from this into
the congregation of the brethren he is handed over to another Elder, who
is placed over ten of the juniors, who are entrusted to him by the
Abbot, and whom he both teaches and governs in accordance with the
arrangement which we read of in Exodus as made by Moses. <span

<span id="iv.iii.iv.vii-p3"></span> In the same way the Rule of S.
Benedict (c. lviii.) directs that the novice is to be placed in the
guest house for a few days, while that of S. Isidore is more precise in
ordering him to be placed there “for three months,” and to wait on the
guests there. Two months is the period fixed by other rules, but a few
days was all that was ultimately required, and Cassian stands alone in
mentioning a full year as the duration of this service, though Sozomen
speaks of the monks of Tabenna as having to undergo a probation of three
years. H. E., III. xiv.

<span id="iv.iii.iv.vii-p4"></span> Cf. [Exod. xviii.
25](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#025.md)<span
id="iv.iii.iv.vii-p4.1"></span>. The office of “Dean” (Decanus) which is
here spoken of by Cassian, is also referred to by Augustine (*De Mor.
Eccl*. xxxi.) and Jerome (*Ep*. xxii. *ad Eustoch*.), and recognized by
the Rule of S. Benedict, c. xxi., where directions for his appointment
are given.
