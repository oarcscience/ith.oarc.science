#### <span id="iv.vi.ii.i-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.i-p1"></span>How we came to Diolcos and were received
by Abbot Piamun. <span id="fr_2070"></span>[2071](#fn_2070.md)

<span id="iv.vi.ii.i-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.i-p3.1"></span>After</span> visiting and conversing with
those three Elders, whose Conferences we have at the instance of our
brother Eucherius tried to describe, as we were still more ardently
desirous to seek out the further parts of Egypt, in which a larger and
more perfect company of saints dwelt, we came—urged not so much by the
necessities of our journey as by the desire of visiting the saints who
were dwelling there—to a village named Diolcos, <span
id="fr_2071"></span>[2072](#fn_2071.md) lying on one of the seven mouths of
the river Nile. For when we heard of very many and very celebrated
monasteries founded by the ancient fathers, like most eager merchants,
at once we undertook the journey on an uncertain quest, urged on by the
hope of greater gain. And when we wandered about there for some long
time and fixed our curious eyes on those mountains of virtue conspicuous
for their lofty height, the gaze of those around first singled out Abbot
Piamun, the senior of all the anchorites living there and their
presbyter, as if he were some tall lighthouse. For he was set on the top
of a high mountain like that city in the gospel, <span
id="fr_2072"></span>[2073](#fn_2072.md) and at once shed his light on our
faces, whose virtues and miracles, which were wrought by him under our
very eyes, Divine Grace thus bearing witness to his excellence, if we
are not to exceed the plan and limits of this volume, we feel we must
pass over in silence. For we promised to commit to memory what we could
recollect, not of the miracles of God, but of the institutes and
pursuits of the saints, so as to supply our readers merely with
necessary instruction for the perfect life, and not with matter for idle
and useless admiration without any correction of their faults. And so
when Abbot Piamun had received us with welcome, and had refreshed us
with becoming kindness, as he understood that we were not of the same
country, he first asked us anxiously whence or why we had visited Egypt,
and when he discovered that we had come thither from a monastery in
Syria out of desire for perfection he began as follows:—

<span id="iv.vi.ii.i-p2"></span> Piamun, who has been already spoken of
in XVII. xxiv., is also mentioned by Rufinus (History of the Monks, c.
xxxii.), Palladius (the Lausiac History, clxxii.), and Sozomen (H. E.
VI. xxix.), all of whom tell, with slight variations, the same story,
how that one day while he was officiating at the altar, he saw an angel
writing down the names of some of the brethren, and passing by the names
of others, all of whom Piamun on subsequent inquiry found to have been
guilty of some grievous sin.
