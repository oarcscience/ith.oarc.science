#### <span id="iv.vii.viii.xx-p0.1"></span>Chapter XX.

<span id="iv.vii.viii.xx-p1"></span>He tries by stronger and weightier
arguments to destroy that notion.

<span id="iv.vii.viii.xx-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.viii.xx-p2.1"></span>But</span> why are we so long dealing
with your wild blasphemy, with arguments that are plain indeed but still
slight? Let us hear God Himself speaking to His disciples: “Heal the
sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out devils.” <span
id="fr_2647"></span>[2648](#fn_2647.md) And again: “In My name,” He says,
“ye shall cast out devils.” <span id="fr_2648"></span>[2649](#fn_2648.md)
Had He any need of Another’s name for the exercise of His power, who
made His own name to be a power? But what is still added? “Behold,” He
says, “I have given you power to tread upon serpents and scorpions and
upon all the power of the enemy.” <span
id="fr_2649"></span>[2650](#fn_2649.md) He Himself says that He was gentle,
as indeed He was, and humble in heart. And how was it that as regards
the greatest possible power, He commanded others to work in His own
name, if He Himself worked in Another’s name? Or did He give to others,
as if it were His own, what He Himself, according to you, did not
possess, unless He received it from Another? But tell me, which of the
saints receiving power from God, so worked? Or would not Peter have been
thought a lunatic, or John a madman, or Paul out of his mind, if they
had said to any sick folk: “In our name arise;” or to the lame: “In our
name walk;” or to the dead: “In our name live;” or this to some: “We
give you power to tread upon serpents and scorpions and upon all the
power of the enemy”? You see then from this your madness: for just as
these words are mad if they spring from man’s assurance, so are you
utterly mad if you do not see that they come from Divine power. For you
must admit one of two alternatives; either that man could possess and
give Divine power, or at any rate if no man can do this, that He who
could do it, was God. For no one can grant of His liberality Divine
power, except Him who possesses it by nature.
