#### <span id="iii.xxx-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXIX.

<span id="iii.xxx-p1"></span>Recapitulation.

<span id="iii.xxx-p2"></span>\[76.\] <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.xxx-p2.1"></span>This</span> being the case, it is now time that
we should recapitulate, at the close of this second Commonitory, what
was said in that and in the preceding.

<span id="iii.xxx-p3"></span>We said above, that it has always been the
custom of Catholics, and still is, to prove the true faith in these two
ways; first by the authority of the Divine Canon, and next by the
tradition of the Catholic Church. Not that the Canon alone does not of
itself suffice for every question, but seeing that the more part,
interpreting the divine words according to their own persuasion, take up
various erroneous opinions, it is therefore necessary that the
interpretation of divine Scripture should be ruled according to the one
standard of the Church’s belief, especially in those articles on which
the foundations of all Catholic doctrine rest.

<span id="iii.xxx-p4"></span>\[77.\] We said likewise, that in the
Church itself regard must be had to the consentient voice of
universality equally with that of antiquity, lest we either be torn from
the integrity of unity and carried away to schism, or be precipitated
from the religion of antiquity into heretical novelties. We said,
further, that in this same ecclesiastical antiquity two points are very
carefully and earnestly to be held in view by those who <span
id="page_154">p. 154</span> <span id="iii.xxx-Page_154"></span>would
keep clear of heresy: first, they should ascertain whether any decision
has been given in ancient times as to the matter in question by the
whole priesthood of the Catholic Church, with the authority of a General
Council: and, secondly, if some new question should arise on which no
such decision has been given, they should then have recourse to the
opinions of the holy Fathers, of those at least, who, each in his own
time and place, remaining in the unity of communion and of the faith,
were accepted as approved masters; and whatsoever these may be found to
have held, with one mind and with one consent, this ought to be
accounted the true and Catholic doctrine of the Church, without any
doubt or scruple.

<span id="iii.xxx-p5"></span>\[78.\] Which lest we should seem to allege
presumptuously on our own warrant rather than on the authority of the
Church, we appealed to the example of the holy council which some three
years ago was held at Ephesus <span id="fr_516"></span>[517](#fn_516.md) in
Asia, in the consulship of Bassus and Antiochus, where, when question
was raised as to the authoritative determining of rules of faith, lest,
perchance, any profane novelty should creep in, as did the perversion of
the truth at Ariminum, <span id="fr_517"></span>[518](#fn_517.md) the whole
body of priests there assembled, nearly two hundred in number, approved
of this as the most Catholic, the most trustworthy, and the best course,
viz., to bring forth into the midst the sentiments of the holy Fathers,
some of whom it was well known had been martyrs, some Confessors, but
all had been, and continued to the end to be, Catholic priests, in order
that by their consentient determination the reverence due to ancient
truth might be duly and solemnly confirmed, and the blasphemy of profane
novelty condemned. Which having been done, that impious Nestorius was
lawfully and deservedly adjudged to be opposed to Catholic antiquity,
and contrariwise blessed Cyril to be in agreement with it. And that
nothing might be wanting to the credibility of the matter, we recorded
the names and the number (though we had forgotten the order) of the
Fathers, according to whose consentient and unanimous judgment, both the
sacred preliminaries of judicial procedure were expounded, and the rule
of divine truth established. Whom, that we may strengthen our memory, it
will be no superfluous labour to mention again here also.
