#### <span id="ii.ii.xxviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXVII.

<span id="ii.ii.xxviii-p1"></span>Wonderful Piety of Martin.

<span id="ii.ii.xxviii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.ii.xxviii-p2.1"></span>No</span> one ever saw him enraged, or
excited, or lamenting, or laughing; he was always one and the same:
displaying a kind of heavenly happiness in his countenance, he seemed to
have passed the ordinary limits of human nature. Never was there any
word on his lips but Christ, and never was there a feeling in his heart
except piety, peace, and tender mercy. Frequently, too, he used to weep
for the sins of those who showed themselves his revilers—those who, as
he led his retired and tranquil life, slandered him with poisoned tongue
and a viper’s mouth. And truly we have had experience of some who were
envious of his virtues and his life—who really hated in him what they
did not see in themselves, and what they had not power to imitate. And—O
wickedness worthy of deepest grief and groans!—some of his calumniators,
although very few, some of his maligners, I say, were reported to be no
others than bishops! Here, however, it is not necessary to name any one,
although a good many of these people are still venting <span
id="fr_41"></span>[42](#fn_41.md) their spleen against myself. I shall deem
it sufficient that, if any one of them reads this account, and perceives
that he is himself pointed at, he may have the grace to blush. But if,
on the other hand, he shows anger, he will, by that very fact, own that
he is among those spoken of, though all the time perhaps I have been
thinking of some other person. I shall, however, by no means feel
ashamed if any people of that sort include myself in their hatred along
with such a man as Martin. I am quite persuaded of this, that the
present little work will give pleasure to all truly good men. And I
shall only say further that, if any one read this narrative in an
unbelieving spirit, he himself will fall into sin. I am conscious to
myself that I have been induced by belief in the facts, and by the love
of Christ, to write these things; and that, in doing so, I have set
forth what is well known, and recorded what is true; and, as I trust,
that man will have a reward prepared by God, not who shall read these
things, but who shall believe them. <span id="fr_42"></span>[43](#fn_42.md)

<span id="ii.ii.xxviii-p4"></span> It seems extremely difficult (to
recur to the point once more), after reading this account of St. Martin
by Sulpitius, to form any certain conclusion regarding it. The writer so
frequently and solemnly assures us of his good faith, and there is such
a verisimilitude about the style, that it appears impossible to accept
the theory of willful deception on the part of the writer. And then, he
was so intimately acquainted with the subject of his narrative, that he
could hardly have accepted fictions for facts, or failed in his estimate
of the friend he so much admired and loved. Altogether, this *Life of
St. Martin* seems to bring before us one of the puzzles of history. The
saint himself must evidently have been a very extraordinary man, to
impress one of the talents and learning of Sulpitius so remarkably as he
did; but it is extremely hard to say how far the miraculous narratives,
which enter so largely into the account before us, were due to pure
invention, or unconscious hallucination. Milner remarks (*Church
History*, II. 193), “I should be ashamed, as well as think the labor ill
spent, to recite the stories at length which Sulpitius gives us.” See,
on the other side, Cardinal Newman’s *Essays on Miracles*, p. 127, 209,
&c.
