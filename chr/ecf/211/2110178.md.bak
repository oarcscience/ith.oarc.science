#### <span id="ii.vi.i.xliv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XLIV.

<span id="ii.vi.i.xliv-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.vi.i.xliv-p1.1"></span>At</span> that time, Ahab, king of
Samaria, coveted the vineyard of Naboth, which was adjacent to his own.
And as Naboth was unwilling to sell it to him, he was cut off by the
wiles of Jezebel. Thus Ahab got possession of the vineyard, though he is
said at the same time to have regretted the death of Naboth.
Acknowledging his crime, he is related to have done <span
id="fr_318"></span>[319](#fn_318.md) penance clothed in sackcloth; and in
this way he turned aside threatening punishment. For the king of Syria
with a great army, having formed a military confederacy with thirty-two
kings, entered the territories of Samaria, and began to besiege the city
with its king. The affairs of the besieged being then in a state of
great distress, the Syrian king offers these conditions in the war,—if
they should give up their gold and silver and women, he would spare
their lives. But, with such iniquitous conditions offered, it seemed
better to suffer the greatest extremities. And now when the safety of
all was despaired of, a prophet sent by God went to the king, encouraged
him to go forth to battle, and when he hesitated, strengthened his
confidence in many ways. Accordingly making a sally, the enemy were
routed, and an abundant store of booty was secured. But, after a year,
the Syrian king returned with recruited strength into Samaria, burning
to avenge the defeat he had received, but was again overthrown. In that
battle one hundred and twenty thousand of the Syrians perished; the king
was pardoned, and his kingdom and former position were granted him. Then
Ahab was reproved by the prophet in the words of God, for having abused
the divine kindness, and spared the enemy delivered up to him. The
Syrian king, therefore, after three years, made war upon the Hebrews.
Against him Ahab, under the advice of some false prophet, went forth to
battle, having spurned the words of Michea the prophet and cast him into
prison, because the prophet had warned him that the fight would prove
disastrous to him. Thus, then, Ahab, being slain in that battle, left
the kingdom to his son Ochozia.
