#### <span id="iv.vi.ii.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.iii-p1"></span>How the juniors ought not to discuss
the orders of the seniors.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.iii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.iii-p2.1"></span>Wherefore</span> if, as we believe, the
cause of God has drawn you to try to copy our knowledge, you must
utterly ignore all the rules by which your early beginnings were
trained, and must with all humility follow whatever you see our Elders
do or teach. And do not be troubled or drawn away and diverted from
imitating it, even if for the moment the cause or reason of any deed or
action is not clear to you, because if men have good and simple ideas on
all things and are anxious faithfully to copy whatever they see taught
or done by their Elders, instead of discussing it, then the knowledge of
all things will follow through experience of the work. But he will never
enter into the reason of the truth, who begins to learn by discussion,
because as the enemy sees that he trusts to his own judgment rather than
to that of the fathers’ he easily urges him on so far till those things
which are especially useful and helpful seem to him unnecessary or
injurious, and the crafty foe so plays upon his presumption, that by
obstinately clinging to his own opinion he persuades himself that only
that is holy, which he himself in his pig-headed error thinks to be good
and right.
