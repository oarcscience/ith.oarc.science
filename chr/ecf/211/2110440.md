#### <span id="iv.iii.vii.xxiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXIV.

<span id="iv.iii.vii.xxiv-p1"></span>That covetousness cannot be
overcome except by stripping one’s self of everything.

<span id="iv.iii.vii.xxiv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.vii.xxiv-p2.1"></span>This</span> is a sufficiently dreadful
and clear instance of this tyranny, which, when once the mind is taken
prisoner by it, allows it to keep to no rules of honesty, nor to be
satisfied with any additions to its gains. For we must seek to put an
end to this madness, not by riches, but by stripping ourselves of them.
Lastly, when he (viz. Judas) had received the bag set apart for the
distribution to the poor, and intrusted to his care for this purpose,
that he might at least satisfy himself with plenty of money, and set a
limit to his avarice, yet his plentiful supply only broke out into a
still greedier incitement of desire, so that he was ready no longer
secretly to rob the bag, but actually to sell the Lord Himself. For the
madness of this avarice is not satisfied with any amount of riches.
