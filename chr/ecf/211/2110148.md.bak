#### <span id="ii.vi.i.xiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIV.

<span id="ii.vi.i.xiv-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.vi.i.xiv-p1.1"></span>But</span> the Hebrews, oppressed by the
multiplied evils of slavery, directed their complaints to heaven, and
cherished the hope of assistance from God. Then, as Moses was feeding
his sheep, suddenly a bush appeared to him burning, but, what was
surprising, the flames did it no harm. Astonished at such an
extraordinary sight, he drew nearer to the bush, and immedi<span

God spoke to him in words to this effect, that he was the Lord of
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and that he desired that their descendants,
who were kept down under the tyranny of the Egyptians, should be
delivered from their sufferings, and that he, therefore, should go to
the king of Egypt, and present himself as a leader for restoring them to
liberty. When he hesitated, God strengthened him with power, and
imparted to him the gift of working miracles. Thus Moses, going into
Egypt, after he had first performed miracles in the presence of his own
people, and having associated his brother Aaron with him, went to the
king, declaring that he had been sent by God, and that he now told him
in the words of God to let the Hebrew people go. But the king, affirming
that he did not know the Lord, refused to obey the command addressed to
him. And when Moses, in proof that the orders he issued were from God,
changed his rod into a serpent, <span id="fr_273"></span>[274](#fn_273.md)
and soon after convened all the water into blood, while he filled the
whole land with frogs, as the Chaldæans were doing similar things, the
king declared that the wonders performed by Moses were simply due to the
arts of magic, and not to the power of God, until the land was covered
with stinging insects brought over it, when the Chaldæans confessed that
this was done by the divine majesty. Then the king, constrained by his
sufferings, called to him Moses and Aaron, and gave the people liberty
to depart, provided that the calamity brought upon the kingdom were
removed. But, after the suffering was put an end to, his mind, having no
control over itself returned to its former state, and did not allow the
Israelites to depart, as had been agreed upon. Finally, however, he was
broken down and conquered by the ten plagues which were sent upon his
person and his kingdom.
