#### <span id="iv.iv.vi.xix-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIX.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.xix-p1"></span>The reason why one nation is to be
forsaken, while seven are commanded to be destroyed.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.xix-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.vi.xix-p2.1"></span>But</span> the reason why that nation in
which the children of Israel were born, was bidden not to be utterly
destroyed but only to have its land forsaken, while it was commanded
that these seven nations were to be completely destroyed, is this:
because however great may be the ardour of spirit, inspired by which we
have entered on the desert of virtues, yet we cannot possibly free
ourselves entirely from the neighbourhood of gluttony or from its
service and, so to speak, from daily intercourse with it. For the liking
for delicacies and dainties will live on as something natural and innate
in us, even though we take pains to cut off all superfluous appetites
and desires, which, as they cannot be altogether destroyed, ought to be
shunned and avoided. For of these we read “Take no care for the flesh
with its desires.” <span id="fr_1351"></span>[1352](#fn_1351) While then
we still retain the feeling for this care, which we are bidden not
altogether to cut off, but to keep without its desires, it is clear that
we do not destroy the Egyptian nation but separate ourselves in a sort
of way from it, not thinking anything about luxuries and delicate
feasts, but, as the Apostle says, being “content with our daily food and
clothing.” <span id="fr_1352"></span>[1353](#fn_1352) And this is
commanded in a figure in the law, in this way: “Thou shalt not abhor the
Egyptian, because thou wast a stranger in his land.” <span
id="fr_1353"></span>[1354](#fn_1353) For necessary food is not refused
to the body without danger to it and sinfulness in the soul. But of
those seven troublesome faults we must in every possible way root out
the affections from the inmost recesses of our souls. For of them we
read: “Let all bitterness and anger and indignation and clamour and
blasphemy be put away from you with all malice:” and again: “But
fornication and all uncleanness and covetousness let it not so much as
be named among you, or obscenity or foolish talking or
scurrility.” <span id="fr_1354"></span>[1355](#fn_1354) We can then cut
out the roots of these faults which are grafted into our nature from
without while we cannot possibly cut off occasions of gluttony. For
however far we have advanced, we cannot help being what we were born.
And that this is so we can show not only from the lives of little people
like ourselves but from the lives and customs of all who have attained
perfection, who even when they have <span id="page_349">p. 349</span>
<span id="iv.iv.vi.xix-Page_349"></span>got rid of incentives to all
other passions, and are retiring to the desert with perfect fervour of
spirit and bodily abnegation, yet still cannot do without thought for
their daily meal and the preparation of their food from year to year.
