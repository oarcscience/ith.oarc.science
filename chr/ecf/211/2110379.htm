<p class="subh"><a name="iv.iii.v.vi-p1"></A>That the mind is not intoxicated by wine alone.</p>  
<p class="skip"><a name="iv.iii.v.vi-p2"></A><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iii.v.vi-p2.1"></A>The</span> belly when filled with all kinds of food gives birth to seeds of wantonness, nor can the mind, when choked with the weight of food, keep the guidance and government of the thoughts. For not only is drunkenness with wine wont to intoxicate the mind, but excess of all kinds of food makes it weak and uncertain, and robs it of all its power of pure and clear contemplation.
