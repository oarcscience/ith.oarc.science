#### <span id="iv.iii.v.xix-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIX.

<span id="iv.iii.v.xix-p1"></span>That the athlete of Christ, so long as
he is in the body, is never without a battle.

<span id="iv.iii.v.xix-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.v.xix-p2.1"></span>The</span> athlete of Christ, as long as
he is in the body, is never in want of a victory to be gained in
contests: but in proportion as he grows by triumphant successes, so does
a severer kind of struggle confront him. For when the flesh is subdued
and conquered, what swarms of foes, what hosts of enemies are incited by
his triumphs and rise up against the victorious soldier of Christ! for
fear lest in the ease of peace the soldier of Christ might relax his
efforts and begin to forget the glorious struggles of his contests, and
be rendered slack through the idleness which is caused by immunity from
danger, and be cheated of the reward of his prizes and the recompense of
his triumphs. And so if we want to rise with ever-growing virtue to
these stages of triumph we ought also in the same way to enter the lists
of battle and begin by saying with the Apostle: “I so fight, not as one
that beateth the air, but I chastise my body and bring it into sub<span
id="page_241">p. 241</span> <span
id="iv.iii.v.xix-Page_241"></span>jection,” <span
id="fr_855"></span>[856](#fn_855.md) that when this conflict is ended we
may once more be able to say with him: “we wrestle not against flesh and
blood, but against principalities, against powers, against world-rulers
of this darkness, against spiritual wickedness in heavenly
places.” <span id="fr_856"></span>[857](#fn_856.md) For otherwise we cannot
possibly join battle with them nor deserve to make trial of spiritual
combats if we are baffled in a carnal contest, and smitten down in a
struggle with the belly: and deservedly will it be said of us by the
Apostle in the language of blame: “Temptation does not overtake you,
except what is common to man.” <span id="fr_857"></span>[858](#fn_857.md)
