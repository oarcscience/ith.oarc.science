#### <span id="iv.v.ii.xiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIII.

<span id="iv.v.ii.xiii-p1"></span>Of the fear which is the outcome of
the greatest love.

<span id="iv.v.ii.xiii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.ii.xiii-p2.1"></span>Whoever</span> then has been established
in this perfect love is sure to mount by a higher stage to that still
more sublime fear belonging to love, which is the outcome of no dread of
punishment or greed of reward, but of the greatest love; whereby a son
fears with earnest affection a most indulgent father, or a brother fears
his brother, a friend his friend, or a wife her husband, while there is
no dread of his blows or reproaches, but only of a slight injury to his
love, and while in every word as well as act there is ever care taken by
anxious affection lest the warmth of his love should cool in the very
slightest degree towards the object of it. And one of the prophets has
finely described the grandeur of this fear, saying: “Wisdom and
knowledge are the riches of salvation: the fear of the Lord is his
treasure.” <span id="fr_1729"></span>[1730](#fn_1729.md) He could not
describe with greater clearness the worth and value of that fear than by
saying that the riches of our salvation, which consist in true wisdom
and knowledge of God, can only be preserved by the fear of the Lord. To
this fear then not sinners but saints are invited by the prophetic word
where the Psalmist says: “O fear the Lord, all ye His Saints: for they
that fear Him lack nothing.” <span id="fr_1730"></span>[1731](#fn_1730.md)
For where a man fears the Lord with this fear it is certain that nothing
is lacking to his perfection. For it was clearly of that other penal
fear that the Apostle John said that “He who feareth is not made perfect
in love, for fear hath punishment.” <span
id="fr_1731"></span>[1732](#fn_1731.md) There is then a great difference
between this fear, to which nothing is lacking, which is the treasure of
wisdom and knowledge, and that imperfect fear which is called “the
beginning of wisdom,” <span id="fr_1732"></span>[1733](#fn_1732.md) and
which has in it punishment and so is expelled from the hearts of those
who are perfect by the incoming of the fulness of love. For “there is no
fear in love, but perfect love casteth out fear.” <span
id="fr_1733"></span>[1734](#fn_1733.md) And in truth if the beginning of
wisdom consists in fear, what will its perfection be except in the love
of Christ which, as it contains in it the fear which belongs to perfect
love, is called not the beginning but the treasure of wisdom and
knowledge? And therefore there is a twofold stage of fear. The one for
beginners, i.e., for those who are still subject to the yoke and to
servile terror; of which we read: “And the servant shall fear his
Lord;” <span id="fr_1734"></span>[1735](#fn_1734.md) and in the gospel: “I
no longer call you servants, for the servant knoweth not what his Lord
doeth;” and therefore “the servant,” He tells us, “abideth not in the
house for ever, but the Son abideth for ever.” <span
id="fr_1735"></span>[1736](#fn_1735.md) For He is instructing us to pass on
from that penal fear to the fullest freedom of love, and the confidence
of the friends and sons of God. Finally the blessed Apostle, who had by
the power of the Lord’s love already passed through the servile stage of
fear, scorns lower things and declares that he has been enriched with
good things by the Lord, “for God hath not given us” he says “a spirit
of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind.” <span
id="fr_1736"></span>[1737](#fn_1736.md) Those also who are inflamed with a
perfect love of their heavenly Father, and whom the Divine adoption has
already made sons instead of servants, he addresses in these words: “For
ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear, but ye
received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.” <span
id="fr_1737"></span>[1738](#fn_1737.md) It is of this fear too, that the
prophet spoke when he would describe that sevenfold spirit, which
according to the mystery of the Incarnation, full surely descended on
the God man: <span id="fr_1738"></span>[1739](#fn_1738.md) “And there shall
rest upon Him the Spirit of the Lord: the Spirit of wisdom and of
understanding, the Spirit of counsel and of might, the Spirit of
knowledge and of true godliness,” and in the last place he adds as
something special these words: “And the Spirit of the fear of the Lord
shall fill Him.” <span id="fr_1739"></span>[1740](#fn_1739.md)  Where we
must in the first place notice carefully that he does not say “and
*there shall rest upon Him* the Spirit of fear,” as he said in the
earlier cases, but he says “*there shall fill Him* the Spirit of the
fear of the Lord.” For such is the greatness of its richness that when
once it has seized on a man by its power, it takes possession not of a
portion but of his whole mind. And not without good reason. For as it is
closely joined to that love which “never faileth,” it not only fills the
man, but takes a lasting and inseparable <span id="page_422">p.
422</span> <span id="iv.v.ii.xiii-Page_422"></span>and continual
possession of him in whom it has begun, and is not lessened by any
allurements of temporal joy or delights, as is sometimes the case with
that fear which is cast out. This then is the fear belonging to
perfection, with which we are told that the God-man, <span
id="fr_1740"></span>[1741](#fn_1740.md) who came not only to redeem
mankind, but also to give us a pattern of perfection and example of
goodness, was filled. For the true Son of God “who did no sin neither
was guile found in His mouth,” <span
id="fr_1741"></span>[1742](#fn_1741.md) could not feel that servile fear of
punishment.
