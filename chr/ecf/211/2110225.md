#### <span id="ii.vi.ii.xxxvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXVI.

<span id="ii.vi.ii.xxxvi-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.vi.ii.xxxvi-p1.1"></span>Accordingly</span>, they first attack
and condemn in his absence Athanasius, bishop of Alexandria, a holy man,
who had been present as deacon at the Synod of Nicæa. For they added to
the charges which false witnesses had heaped up against him, this one,
that, with wicked intentions, he had received <span
id="fr_365"></span>[366](#fn_365.md) Marcellus and Photinus, heretical
priests who had been condemned by a sentence of the Synod. Now, it was
not doubtful as to Photinus that he had been justly condemned. But in
the case of Marcellus, it seemed that nothing had then been found worthy
of condemnation, and <span id="fr_366"></span>[367](#fn_366.md) a belief in
his innocence was above all strengthened by the *animus* of that party,
inasmuch as no one doubted that those same judges were heretical by whom
he had been condemned. But the Arians did not so much desire to get
these persons out of the way as Athanasius himself. Accordingly, they
constrain the emperor to go so far as this, that Athanasius should be
sent as an exile into Gaul. But ere long, eighty bishops, assembling
together in Egypt, declare that Athanasius had been unjustly condemned.
The matter is referred to Constantine: he orders <span
id="fr_367"></span>[368](#fn_367.md) bishops from the whole world to
assemble at Sardes, and that the entire process by which Athanasius had
been condemned, should be reconsidered by the council. In the meantime,
Constantine dies, but the Synod, called together while he was yet
emperor, acquits Athanasius. Marcellus, too, is restored to his
bishopric, but the sentence on Photinus, bishop of Sirmion, was not
rescinded; for even <span id="fr_368"></span>[369](#fn_368.md) in the
judgment of our friends, he is regarded as a heretic. However, even this
result chagrined Marcellus, because Photinus was known to have been his
disciple in his youth. But this, too, tended to secure an acquittal for
Athanasius, that Ursatius and Valens, leading men among the Arians, when
they were openly separated from the communion of the Church after the
Synod at Sardes, entering into the presence of Julius, bishop of Rome,
asked pardon of him for having condemned the innocent, and publicly
declared that he had been justly acquitted by the decree of the Council
of Sardes.

<span id="ii.vi.ii.xxxvi-p4"></span> It has been remarked that Sulpitius
is in error in ascribing the summoning of this council to Constantine
the Great, instead of his son Constantine II. The curious thing is that
he should have made a mistake regarding an event so near his own time.
