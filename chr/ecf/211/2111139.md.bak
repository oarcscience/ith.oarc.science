<span id="iv.vii.vi.iv"></span>

#### <span id="iv.vii.vi.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.

<span id="iv.vii.vi.iv-p1"></span>What the difference is between Christ
and the saints.

<span id="iv.vii.vi.iv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.vi.iv-p2.1"></span>Moreover</span> there is between Him and
all the saints the same difference that there is between a dwelling and
one who dwells in it, for certainly it is the doing of the dweller not
the dwelling, if it is inhabited, for on him it depends both to build
the house and to occupy it. I mean, that he can choose, if he will, to
make it a dwelling, and when he has made it, to live in it. “Or do you
seek a proof,” says the Apostle, “of Christ speaking in me?” <span
id="fr_2496"></span>[2497](#fn_2496.md) And elsewhere, “Know ye not that
Jesus Christ is in you except ye be reprobate?” <span
id="fr_2497"></span>[2498](#fn_2497.md) And again: “in the inner man, that
Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith.” <span
id="fr_2498"></span>[2499](#fn_2498.md) Do you not see what a difference
there is between the Apostle’s doctrine and your blasphemies? You say
that God dwells in Christ as in a man. He testifies that Christ Himself
dwells in men: which certainly, as you admit, flesh and blood cannot do;
so that He is shown to be God, from the very fact from which you deny
Him to be God. For since you cannot deny that He who dwells in man is
God, it follows that we must believe that He, whom we know to dwell in
men, is most decidedly God. All, then, whether patriarchs, or prophets,
or apostles, or martyrs, or saints, had every one of them God within
him, and were all made sons of God and were all receivers of God (<span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.vii.vi.iv-p5.2"></span>Θεοδόχοι</span>), but
in a very different and distinct way. For all who believe in God are
sons of God by adoption: but the only begotten alone is Son by nature:
who was begotten of His Father, not of any material substance, for all
things, and the substance of all things exist through the only begotten
Son of God—and not out of nothing, because He is from the Father: not
like a birth, for there is nothing in God that is void or mutable, but
in an ineffable and incomprehensible manner God the Father, wherein He
Himself was regenerate, begat his only begotten Son; and so from the
Most High, Ingenerate, and Eternal Father proceeds the Most High, Only
Begotten, and Eternal Son. Who must be considered the same Person in the
flesh as He is in the Spirit: and must be held to be the same Person in
the body as He is in glory, for when He was about to be born in the
flesh, <span id="fr_2499"></span>[2500](#fn_2499.md) He made no division or
separation within Himself, as if some portion of Him was born while
another portion was not born: or as if some portion of Divinity
afterwards came upon Him, which had not been in Him at His birth from
the Virgin. For according to the Apostle, “all the fulness of the
Godhead dwelleth in Christ bodily.” <span
id="fr_2500"></span>[2501](#fn_2500.md) Not that It dwells in Him at times,
and at times dwells not; nor that It was there at a later date, and not
an earlier one: otherwise we are entangled in that impious heresy of
Pelagius, so as to say that from a fixed moment God dwelt in Christ, and
that He then came upon Him; when He had won by His life and conversation
this; viz., that the power of the Godhead should dwell in Him. These
things then belong to men, to men, I say, not to God,—that as far as
human weakness can, they should humble themselves to God, be subject to
God, make themselves dwellings for God, and by their faith and piety win
this, to have God as their guest and indweller. For in proportion as
anyone is fit for God’s gift, so does the Divine grace reward him: in
proportion as a man seems worthy of him: in proportion as a man seems
worthy of <span id="page_583">p. 583</span> <span
id="iv.vii.vi.iv-Page_583"></span>God, so does he enjoy God’s presence,
according to the Lord’s promise: “if any man love Me, he will keep My
word; and I and My Father will come to him and make Our abode with
him.” <span id="fr_2501"></span>[2502](#fn_2501.md) But very different is
the case as regards Christ; in whom all the fulness of the Godhead
dwelleth bodily: for He has within Him the fulness of the Godhead so
that He gives to all of His fulness, and He—as the fulness of the
Godhead dwells in Him—Himself dwells in each of the saints in proportion
as He deems them worthy of His Presence, and gives of His fulness to
all, yet in such a way that He Himself continues in all that
fulness,—who even when He was on earth in the flesh, yet was present in
the hearts of all the saints, and filled the heaven, the earth, the sea,
aye and the whole universe with His infinite power and majesty; and yet
was so complete in Himself that the whole world could not contain Him.
For however great and inexpressible whatever is made may be, yet there
are no things so boundless and infinite as to be able to contain the
Creator Himself.
