#### <span id="iv.iii.x.xi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XI.

<span id="iv.iii.x.xi-p1"></span>That he preached and taught men to work
not only by his example, but also by his words.

<span id="iv.iii.x.xi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span

that, while he worked in silence and tried to teach them by example, he
had not instructed them by precepts and warnings, he proceeds to say:
“For when we were with you, this we declared to you, that if a man will
not work neither should he eat.” Still greater does he make their
idleness appear, for, though they knew that he, like a good master,
worked with his hands for the sake of his teaching and in order to
instruct them, yet they were ashamed to <span id="page_271">p.

emphasizes our diligence and care by saying that he did not only give
them this for an example when present, but that he also proclaimed it
continually in words; saying that if any one would not work, neither
should he eat.
