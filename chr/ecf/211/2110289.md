#### <span id="iv.iii.i.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.

<span id="iv.iii.i.iv-p1"></span>Of the Tunics of the Egyptians.

<span id="iv.iii.i.iv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.i.iv-p2.1"></span>They</span> wear also linen tunics <span
id="fr_647"></span>[648](#fn_647.md) which scarcely reach to the elbows,
and for the rest leave their hands bare, that the cutting off of the
sleeves may suggest that they have cut off all the deeds and works of
this world, and the garment of linen teach that they are dead to all
earthly conversation, and that hereby they may hear the Apostle saying
day by day to them: “Mortify your members which are upon the earth;”
their very dress also declaring this: “For ye are dead, and your life is
hid with Christ in God;” and again: “And I live, yet now not I but
Christ liveth in me. To me indeed the world is crucified, and I to the
world.” <span id="fr_648"></span>[649](#fn_648.md)
