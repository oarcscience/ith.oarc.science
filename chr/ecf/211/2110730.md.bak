<span id="iv.iv.viii.xxi"></span>

#### <span id="iv.iv.viii.xxi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXI.

<span id="iv.iv.viii.xxi-p1"></span>Of the fact that devils struggle
with men not without effort on their part.

<span id="iv.iv.viii.xxi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.viii.xxi-p2.1"></span>But</span> our belief is that they
undertake this struggle not without effort on their part. For in their
conflict they themselves have some sort of anxiety and depression, and
especially when they are matched with stronger rivals, i.e., saints and
perfect men. Otherwise no contest or struggle, but only a simple
deception of men, and one free from anxiety on their part would be
assigned to them. And how then would the Apostle’s words stand, where he
says: “We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against
principalities, against powers, against world-rulers of this darkness,
against spiritual wickedness in heavenly places;” and this too: “So
fight I, not as one that beateth the air;” and again: “I have fought a
good fight”? <span id="fr_1478"></span>[1479](#fn_1478.md) For where it is
spoken of as a fight, and conflict, and battle, there must be effort and
exertion and anxiety on both sides, and equally there must either be in
store for them chagrin and confusion for their failure, or delight
consequent upon their victory. But where one fights with ease and
security against another who struggles with great effort, and in order
to overthrow his rival makes use of his will alone as his strength,
there it ought not to be called a battle, struggle, or strife, but a
sort of unfair and unreasonable assault and attack. But they certainly
have to labour, and when they attack men, exert themselves in no lesser
degree in order to secure from each one that victory which they want to
obtain, and there is hurled back upon them the same confusion which was
awaiting us had we been worsted by them; as it is said: “The head of
their compassing me about, the labour of their own lips shall overwhelm
them;” and: “His sorrow shall be turned on his own head;” and again:
“Let the snare which he knoweth not come upon him, and let the net which
he hath hidden catch him, and into that very snare let him fall;” <span
id="fr_1479"></span>[1480](#fn_1479.md) viz., that which he contrived for
the deception of men. They then themselves also come to grief, and as
they damage us so are they also in like manner damaged by us, nor when
they are worsted do they depart without confusion, and seeing these
defeats of theirs and their struggles, one who had good eyes in his
inner man, seeing also that they gloated over the downfall and
mischances of individuals, and fearing lest his own case might furnish
them with this kind of delight, prayed to the Lord saying: “Lighten mine
eyes that I sleep not in death: lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed
against him. They that trouble me will rejoice if I be moved;” and: “O
My God, let them not rejoice over me; let them not say in their hearts,
Aha, Aha, our very wish; neither let them say; we have devoured him;”
and: “They gnashed their teeth upon me. Lord, how long wilt Thou look on
this?” for: “he lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den: he lieth in
wait to ravish the poor;” and: “He seeketh from God his meat.” <span
id="fr_1480"></span>[1481](#fn_1480.md) And again when all their efforts
are exhausted, and they have failed to secure our deception, they must
“be confounded and blush” at the failure of their efforts, “who seek our
souls to destroy them: and let them be covered with shame and confusion
who imagine evil against us.” <span id="fr_1481"></span>[1482](#fn_1481.md)
Jeremiah also says: “Let them be confounded, and let not me be
confounded: let them be afraid, and let not me be afraid: bring upon
them the fury of Thy wrath, and with a double destruction destroy
them.” <span id="fr_1482"></span>[1483](#fn_1482.md) For no one can doubt
that when they are vanquished by us they will be destroyed with a double
destruction: first, because while men are seeking after holiness, they,
though they possessed it, lost it, and became the cause of man’s ruin;
secondly, because being spiritual existences, they have been vanquished
by carnal and earthly ones. Each one then of the saints when he looks on
the destruction of his foes and his own triumphs, exclaims with delight:
“I will follow after mine enemies and overtake them: and I will not turn
until they are destroyed. I will break them and they shall not be able
to stand: they shall fall under my feet,” <span
id="fr_1483"></span>[1484](#fn_1483.md) and in his prayers against them the
same prophet says: “Judge thou, O Lord, them that wrong me: overthrow
them that fight against me. Take hold of arms and shield: and rise up to
help me. Bring out the sword and shut up the way against them that
persecute me: say to my soul, I am thy salvation.” <span
id="fr_1484"></span>[1485](#fn_1484.md) And when by <span id="page_370">p.
370</span> <span id="iv.iv.viii.xxi-Page_370"></span>subduing and
destroying all our passions we have vanquished these, we shall then be
permitted to hear those words of blessing: “Thy hand shall be exalted
over thine enemies, and all thine enemies shall perish.” <span
id="fr_1485"></span>[1486](#fn_1485.md) And so when we read or chant all
these and such like passages found in holy writ, unless we take them as
written against those spiritual wickednesses which lie in wait for us
night and day, we shall not only fail to draw from them any edification
to make us gentle and patient, but shall actually meet with some
dreadful consequence and one that is quite contrary to evangelical
perfection. For we shall not only not be taught to pray for or to love
our enemies, but actually shall be stirred up to hate them with an
implacable hatred, and to curse them and incessantly to pour forth
prayers against them. And it is terribly wrong and blasphemous to think
that these words were uttered in such a spirit by holy men and friends
of God, on whom before the coming of Christ the law was not imposed for
the very reason that they went beyond its commands, and chose rather to
obey the precepts of the gospel and to aim at apostolical perfection,
though they lived before the dispensation of the time.
