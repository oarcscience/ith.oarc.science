#### <span id="iv.vi.viii.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VIII.

<span id="iv.vi.viii.viii-p1"></span>The answer that all things are not
suitable for all men.

<span id="iv.vi.viii.viii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.viii.viii-p2.1"></span>Abraham</span>: Sometimes we see bad
precedents taken from good things. For if a man ventures to do the same
thing as another, but not with the same mind and purpose, or not with
equal goodness, he will immediately fall into the snares of deception
and death through the very things from which others gain the fruit of
eternal life: As that strong armed lad matched with the warlike giant in
the combat would certainly have found, if he had been clad in the heavy
armour of Saul fit only for men; and that by which one of stronger age
would have laid low countless hosts of foes, would only have brought
certain danger to the stripling, had he not with prudent discretion
chosen the sort of weapons suitable to his youth, and armed himself
against his foul foe not with breastplate and shield, with which he saw
that others were equipped, but with those weapons with which he was able
to fight. Wherefore it is right for each one of us first to consider
carefully the measure of his powers and in accordance with its limits,
to choose what system he pleases, because though all are good, yet all
things cannot be fit for all men. For we do not assert that because the
anchorite’s life is good, it is therefore suited for everybody: for by
many it is felt to be not only useless, but even injurious. Nor because
we are right in taking up the system of the Cœnobium and the pious and
praiseworthy care of the brethren, do we therefore consider that it
ought to be followed by everybody. So also the fruits of the care of
<span id="page_535">p. 535</span> <span
id="iv.vi.viii.viii-Page_535"></span>strangers are very plentiful, but
this cannot be taken up by everybody without loss of patience. Further,
the systems of your country and of this must first be weighed against
each other; and then the powers of men gathered from the constant
occurrence of their virtues or vices must be severally weighed in the
opposite scales. For it may happen that what is difficult or impossible
for a man of one nation in the case of others is somehow turned by
ingrained habit into nature: just as some nations, separated by a wide
difference of region, can bear tremendous force of cold or heat of the
sun without any covering of the body, which certainly others who have no
experience of that inclement sky, could not possibly endure, however
strong they may be. So also do you who with the utmost efforts of mind
and body are trying in this district to get the better of the nature of
your country in many respects, diligently consider whether in those
regions which, as report says, are frozen, and bound by the cold of
excessive unbelief, you could endure this nakedness, if I may so term
it. For to us the fact that our holy life is of long standing has almost
naturally imparted this fortitude in our purpose, and if we see that you
are our equals in virtue and constancy, you in like manner need not shun
the neighbourhood of your kinsfolk and brethren.

kinsfolk, who can emulate the mortification of Abbot Apollos.](2111069.md)
