<span id="iv.iii.v.ix-p1"></span>Of the measure of the chastisement to
be undertaken, and the remedy of fasting.

<span id="iv.iii.v.ix-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.v.ix-p2.1"></span>The</span> perfection then of abstinence is
not to be gathered from calculations of time alone, nor only from the
quality of the food; but beyond everything from the judgment of
conscience. For each one should impose such a sparing diet on himself as
the battle of his bodily struggle may require. The canonical observance
of fasts is indeed valuable and by all means to be kept. But unless this
is followed by a temperate partaking of food, one will not be able to
arrive at the goal of perfection. For the abstinence of prolonged
fasts—where repletion of body follows—produces weariness for a time
rather than purity and chastity. Perfection of mind indeed depends upon
the abstinence of the belly. He has no lasting purity and chastity, who
is not contented always to keep to a well-balanced and temperate diet.
Fasting, although severe, yet if unnecessary relaxation follows, is
rendered useless, and presently leads to the vice of gluttony. A
reasonable supply of food partaken of daily with moderation, is better
than a severe and long fast at intervals. Excessive fasting has been
known not only to undermine the constancy of the mind, but also to
weaken the power of prayers through sheer weariness of body.
