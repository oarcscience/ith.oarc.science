<span id="iv.vii.iv.v-p1"></span>As it is blasphemy to pare away the
Divinity of Christ, so also is it blasphemous to deny that He is true
man.

<span id="iv.vii.iv.v-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span

God the Father, who raised Him from the dead.” <span id="page_565">p.
565</span> <span id="iv.vii.iv.v-Page_565"></span>That renowned and
admirable teacher, knowing that our Lord Jesus Christ must be preached
as true man, as well as true God, always declares the glory of the
Divine in Him, in such a way as not to lose hold of the confession of
the Incarnation: plainly excluding the phantasm of Marcion, by a real
Incarnation, and the poverty of the Ebionite, by Divinity: lest through
one or other of these wicked blasphemies it might be believed that our
Lord Jesus Christ was either altogether man without God, or God without
man. Excellently then did the Apostle, when declaring that He was sent
by God the Son as well as by God the Father, add at once a confession of
the Lord’s Incarnation, by saying: “Who raised Him from the dead:”
clearly teaching that it was a real body of the Incarnate God, which was
raised from the dead: in accordance with this: “And though we have known
Christ according to the flesh,” excellently adding: “Yet now we know Him
so no longer.” For he says that he knows this in Him according to the
flesh; viz., that He was raised from the dead; but that he knows Him no
longer according to the flesh inasmuch as when the weakness of the flesh
is at an end, he knows that He exists in the Power of God only. Surely
he is a faithful and satisfactory witness of our Lord’s Divinity which
had to be proclaimed, who at his first call was smitten from heaven
itself, and did not merely believe in his heart the glory of our Lord
Jesus Christ, who was raised from the dead, but actually established its
truth by the evidence of his bodily eyes.

the Apostle when persecuting the Church, the existence of both natures
in Him.](2111110.md)
