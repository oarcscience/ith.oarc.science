#### <span id="iv.iv.vi.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.iv-p1"></span>A review of the passions of gluttony
and fornication and their remedies.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.iv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.vi.iv-p2.1"></span>And</span> to make this clearer not only by
a short discussion to the best of my ability, but by <span
id="page_340">p. 340</span> <span
id="iv.iv.vi.iv-Page_340"></span>Scripture proof as well, gluttony and
fornication, though they exist in us naturally (for sometimes they
spring up without any incitement from the mind, and simply at the motion
and allurement of the flesh) yet if they are to be consummated, must
find an external object, and thus take effect only through bodily acts.
For “every man is tempted of his own lust. Then lust when it has
conceived beareth sin, and sin when it is consummated begets
death.” <span id="fr_1313"></span>[1314](#fn_1313.md) For the first Adam
could not have fallen a victim to gluttony unless he had had material
food at hand, and had used it wrongly, nor could the second Adam be
tempted without the enticement of some object, when it was said to Him:
“If Thou art the Son of God, command that these stones be made
bread.” <span id="fr_1314"></span>[1315](#fn_1314.md) And it is clear to
everybody that fornication also is only completed by a bodily act, as
God says of this spirit to the blessed Job: “And his force is in his
loins, and his strength in the navel of his belly.” <span
id="fr_1315"></span>[1316](#fn_1315.md) And so these two faults in
particular, which are carried into effect by the aid of the flesh,
especially require bodily abstinence as well as spiritual care of the
soul; since the determination of the mind is not in itself enough to
resist their attacks (as is sometimes the case with anger or gloominess
or the other passions, which an effort of the mind alone can overcome
without any mortification of the flesh); but bodily chastisement must be
used as well, and be carried out by means of fasting and vigils and acts
of contrition; and to this must be added change of scene, because since
these sins are the results of faults of both mind and body, so they can
only be overcome by the united efforts of both. And although the blessed
Apostle says generally that all faults are carnal, since he enumerates
enmities and anger and heresies among other works of the flesh, <span
id="fr_1316"></span>[1317](#fn_1316.md) yet in order to cure them and to
discover their nature more exactly we make a twofold division of them:
for we call some of them carnal, and some spiritual. And those we call
carnal, which specially have to do with pampering the appetites of the
flesh, and with which it is so charmed and satisfied, that sometimes it
excites the mind when at rest and even drags it against its will to
consent to its desire. Of which the blessed Apostle says: “In which also
we all walked in time past in the desires of our flesh, fulfilling the
will of the flesh and of our thoughts, and were by nature children of
wrath even as the rest.” <span id="fr_1317"></span>[1318](#fn_1317.md) But
we call those spiritual which spring only from the impulse of the mind
and not merely contribute no pleasure to the flesh, but actually bring
on it a weakness that is harmful to it, and only feed a diseased mind
with the food of a most miserable pleasure. And therefore these need a
single medicine for the heart: but those which are carnal can only be
cured, as we said, by a double remedy. Whence it is extremely useful for
those who aspire to purity, to begin by withdrawing from themselves the
material which feeds these carnal passions, through which opportunity
for or recollection of these same desires can arise in a soul that is
still affected by the evil. For a complicated disease needs a
complicated remedy. For from the body the object and material which
would allure it must be withdrawn, for fear lest the lust should
endeavour to break out into act; and before the mind we should no less
carefully place diligent meditation on Scripture and watchful anxiety
and the withdrawal into solitude, lest it should give birth to desire
even in thought. But as regards other faults intercourse with our
fellows is no obstacle, or rather it is of the greatest possible use, to
those who truly desire to get rid of them, because in mixing with others
they more often meet with rebuke, and while they are more frequently
provoked the existence of the faults is made evident, and so they are
cured with speedy remedies.
