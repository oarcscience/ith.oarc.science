#### <span id="iv.iii.ix.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.

<span id="iv.iii.ix.ix-p1"></span>Of another sort of dejection which
produces despair of salvation.

<span id="iv.iii.ix.ix-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.ix.ix-p2.1"></span>There</span> is, too, another still more
objectionable sort of dejection, which produces in the guilty soul no
amendment of life or correction of faults, but the most destructive
despair: which did not make Cain repent after the murder of his brother,
or Judas, after the betrayal, hasten to relieve himself by making
amends, but drove him to hang himself in despair.

us.](2110481)
