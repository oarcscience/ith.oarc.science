#### <span id="iv.iv.viii.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.

<span id="iv.iv.viii.vi-p1"></span>Of perseverance as regards care of
the thoughts.

<span id="iv.iv.viii.vi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.viii.vi-p2.1"></span>But</span> we shall find out by our own
experience that we can and ought to cling to the Lord if we have our
wills mortified and the desires of this world cut off, and we shall be
taught by the authority of those who in converse with the Lord say in
all confidence: “My soul hath stuck close to Thee;” and: “I have stuck
unto Thy testimonies, O Lord;” and: “It is good for me to stick fast to
God;” and: “He who cleaveth to the Lord, is one spirit.” <span
id="fr_1458"></span>[1459](#fn_1458.md) We ought not then to be wearied out
by these wanderings of mind and relax from our fervour: for “he that
tilleth his ground shall be filled with bread: but he that followeth
idleness shall be filled with poverty.” <span
id="fr_1459"></span>[1460](#fn_1459.md) Nor should we be drawn away from
being intent on this watchfulness through a dangerous despair, for “in
every one who is anxious there is abundance, for he who is pleasant and
free from grief will be in want;” and again: “a man in grief labours for
himself, and forcibly brings about his own destruction.” <span
id="fr_1460"></span>[1461](#fn_1460.md) Moreover also: “the kingdom of
heaven suffereth violence and the violent take it by force,” <span
id="fr_1461"></span>[1462](#fn_1461.md) for no virtue is acquired without
effort, nor can anyone attain to that mental stability which he desires
without great sorrow of heart, for “man is born to trouble,” <span
id="fr_1462"></span>[1463](#fn_1462.md) and in order that he may be able to
attain to “the perfect man, the measure of the stature of the fulness of
Christ” <span id="fr_1463"></span>[1464](#fn_1463.md) he must ever be on
the watch with still greater intentness, and toil with ceaseless
carefulness. But to the fulness of this measure no one will ever attain,
but one who has considered it beforehand and been trained to it now and
has had some foretaste of it while still in this world, and being marked
a most precious member of Christ, has possessed in the flesh an earnest
of that “joint” <span id="fr_1464"></span>[1465](#fn_1464.md) by which he
can be united to His body: desiring one thing alone, thirsting for but
one thing, ever bringing not only his acts but even his thoughts to bear
on one thing alone; viz., that he may even now keep as an earnest that
which is said of the blessed life of the saints hereafter; viz., that
“God may be” to him “all in all.” <span
