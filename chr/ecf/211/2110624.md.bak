#### <span id="iv.iv.iv.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.vi-p1"></span>An account of the three sorts of
renunciations.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.vi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.iv.vi-p2.1"></span>We</span> must now speak of the
renunciations, of which tradition and the authority of Holy Scripture
show us three, and which every one of us ought with the utmost zeal to
make complete. The first is that by which as far as the body is
concerned we make light of all the wealth and goods of this world; the
second, that by which we reject the fashions and vices and former
affections of soul and flesh; the third, that by which we detach our
soul from all present and visible things, and contemplate only things to
come, and set our heart on what is invisible. And we read that the Lord
charged Abraham to do all these three at once, when He said to him “Get
thee out from thy country, and thy kinsfolk, and thy father’s
house.” <span id="fr_1207"></span>[1208](#fn_1207.md) First He said “from
thy country,” i.e., from the goods of this world, and earthly riches:
secondly, “from thy kinsfolk,” i.e., from this former life and habits
and sins, which cling to us from our very birth and are joined to us as
it were by ties of affinity and kinship: thirdly, “from thy father’s
house,” i.e., from all the recollection of this world, which the sight
of the eyes can afford. For of the two fathers, i.e., of the one who is
to be forsaken, and of the one who is to be sought, David thus speaks in
the person of God: “Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine
ear: forget also thine own people and thy father’s house:” <span
id="fr_1208"></span>[1209](#fn_1208.md) for the person <span
id="page_322">p. 322</span> <span id="iv.iv.iv.vi-Page_322"></span>who
says “Hearken, O daughter,” is certainly a Father; and yet he bears
witness that the one, whose house and people he urges should be
forgotten, is none the less father of his daughter. And this happens
when being dead with Christ to the rudiments of this world, we no
longer, as the Apostle says, regard “the things which are seen, but
those which are not seen, for the things which are not seen are
eternal,” <span id="fr_1209"></span>[1210](#fn_1209.md) and going forth in
heart from this temporal and visible home, turn our eyes and heart
towards that in which we are to remain for ever. And this we shall
succeed in doing when, while we walk in the flesh, we are no longer at
war with the Lord according to the flesh, proclaiming in deed and
actions the truth of that saying of the blessed Apostle “Our
conversation is in heaven.” <span id="fr_1210"></span>[1211](#fn_1210.md)
To these three sorts of renunciations the three books of Solomon
suitably correspond. For Proverbs answers to the first renunciation, as
in it the desires for carnal things and earthly sins are repressed; to
the second Ecclesiastes corresponds, as there everything which is done
under the sun is declared to be vanity; to the third the Song of Songs,
in which the soul soaring above all things visible, is actually joined
to the word of God by the contemplation of heavenly things.
