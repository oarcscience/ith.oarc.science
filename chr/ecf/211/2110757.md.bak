#### <span id="iv.iv.ix.xiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIII.

<span id="iv.iv.ix.xiii-p1"></span>Of the fact that opposing powers turn
the attack, which they aim at men, even against each other.

<span id="iv.iv.ix.xiii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.ix.xiii-p2.1"></span>For</span> it is quite clear that they
aim these attacks, with which they assault men, even against each other,
for in like manner they do not cease to promote with unwearied strife
the discords and struggles which they have undertaken for some peoples
because of a sort of innate love of wickedness which they have: and this
we read of as being very clearly set forth in the vision of Daniel the
prophet, where the angel Gabriel speaks as follows: “Fear not, Daniel:
for from the first day that thou didst set thy heart to understand, to
afflict thyself in the sight of thy God, thy words have been heard: and
I am come for thy words. But the prince of the kingdom of the Persians
resisted me one and twenty days: and behold Michael one of the chief
princes came to help me, and I remained there by the king of the
Persians. But I am come to teach thee what things shall befall thy
people in the latter days.” <span id="fr_1535"></span>[1536](#fn_1535.md)
And we can not possibly doubt that this prince of the kingdom of the
Persians was a hostile power, which favoured the nation of the Persians
an enemy of God’s people; for in order to hinder the good which it saw
would result from the solution of the question for which the prophet
prayed the Lord, by the archangel, in its jealousy it opposed itself to
prevent the saving comfort of the angel from reaching Daniel too
speedily, and from strengthening the people of God, over which the
archangel Gabriel was: and the latter said that even then, owing to the
fierceness of his assaults, he would not have been able to come to him,
had not Michael the archangel come to help him, and met the prince of
the kingdom of the Persians, and joined battle with him, and intervened,
and defended him from his attack, and so enabled him to come to instruct
the prophet after twenty-one days. And a little later on it says: “And
the angel said: Dost thou know wherefore I am come to thee? And now I
will return to fight against the prince of the Persians. For when I went
forth, there appeared the prince of the Greeks coming. But I will tell
thee what is written down in the Scriptures of truth: and none is my
helper in all these things but Michael your prince.” <span
id="fr_1536"></span>[1537](#fn_1536.md) And again: “At that time shall
Michael rise up, the great prince, who standeth for the children of thy
people.” <span id="fr_1537"></span>[1538](#fn_1537.md) So then we read that
in the same way another was called the prince of the Greeks, who since
he was patron of that nation which was subject to him seems to have been
opposed to the nation of the Persians as well as to the people of
Israel. From which we clearly see that antagonistic powers raise against
each other those quarrels of nations, and conflicts and dissensions,
which they show among themselves at their instigation, and that they
either exult at their victories or are cast down at their defeats, and
thus cannot live in harmony among themselves, while each of them is
always striving with restless jealousy on behalf of those whom he
presides over, against the patron of some other nation.
