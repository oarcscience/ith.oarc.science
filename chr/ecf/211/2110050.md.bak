#### <span id="ii.iv.i.xiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIII.

<span id="ii.iv.i.xiii-p1"></span>“<span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.i.xiii-p1.1"></span>Well</span> then, when I entered upon the
nearest parts of the desert, about twelve miles from the Nile, having as
my guide one of the brethren who was well acquainted with the
localities, we arrived at the residence of a certain old monk who dwelt
at the foot of a mountain. In that place there was a well, which is a
very rare thing in these regions. The monk had one ox, the whole labor
of which consisted in drawing water by moving a machine worked with a
wheel. This was the only way of getting at the water, for the well was
said to be a thousand or more feet deep. There was also a garden there
full of a variety of vegetables. This, too, was contrary to what might
have been expected in the desert where, all things being dry and burnt
up by the fierce rays of the sun produce not even the slenderest root of
any plant. But the labor which in common with his ox, the monk
performed, as well as his own special industry, produced such a happy
state of things to the holy man; for the frequent irrigation in which he
engaged imparted such a fertility to the sand that we saw the vegetables
in his garden flourishing and coming to maturity in a wonderful manner.
On these, then, the ox lived as well as its master; and from the
abundance thus supplied, the holy man provided us also with a dinner.
There I saw what ye Gauls, perchance, may not believe—a pot boiling
without fire <span id="fr_100"></span>[101](#fn_100.md) with the vegetables
which were being got ready for our dinner: such is the power of the sun
in that place that it is sufficient for any cooks, even for preparing
the dainties of the Gauls. Then after dinner, when the evening was
coming on, our host invites us to a palm-tree, the fruit of which he was
accustomed to use, and which was at a distance of about two miles. For
that is the only kind of tree found in the desert, and even these are
rare, though they do occur. I am not sure whether this is owing to the
wise foresight of former ages, or whether the soil naturally produces
them. It may indeed be that God, knowing beforehand that the desert was
one day to be inhabited by the saints, prepared these things for his
servants. For those who settle within these solitudes live for the most
part on the fruit of such trees, since no other kinds of plants thrive
in these quarters. Well, when we came up to that tree to which the
kindness of our host conducted us, we there met with a lion; and on
seeing it, both my guide and myself began to tremble; but the holy man
went up to it without delay, while we, though in great terror, followed
him. As if commanded by God, the beast modestly withdrew and stood
gazing at us, while our friend, the monk, plucked some fruit hanging
within easy reach on the lower branches. And, on his holding out his
hand filled with dates, the monster ran up to him and received them as
readily as any domestic animal could have done; and having eaten them,
it departed. We, beholding these things, and being still under the
influence of fear, could not but perceive how great was the power of
faith in his case, and how weak it was in ourselves.

<span id="ii.iv.i.xiii-p2"></span> Hornius strangely remarks on this,
“Frequens id in Africa. Quin et ferrum nimio solis ardore mollescere
scribunt qui interiorem Libyam perlustrarunt.”
