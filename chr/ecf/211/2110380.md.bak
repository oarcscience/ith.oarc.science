#### <span id="iv.iii.v.vii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.

<span id="iv.iii.v.vii-p1"></span>How bodily weakness need not interfere
with purity of heart.

<span id="iv.iii.v.vii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.v.vii-p2.1"></span>Bodily</span> weakness is no hindrance to
purity of heart, if only so much food is taken as the bodily weakness
requires, and not what pleasure asks for. It is easier to find men who
altogether abstain from the more fattening kinds of foods than men who
make a moderate use of what is allowed to our necessities; and men who
deny themselves everything out of love of continence than men who taking
food on the plea of weakness preserve the due measure of what is
sufficient. <span id="fr_828"></span>[829](#fn_828.md) For bodily weakness
has its glory of self-restraint, where though food is permitted to the
failing body, a man deprives himself of his refreshment. although he
needs it, and only indulges in just so much food as the strict judgment
of temperance decides to be sufficient for the necessities of life, and
not what the longing appetite asks for. The more delicate foods, as they
conduce to bodily health, so they need not destroy the purity of
chastity, if they are taken in moderation. For whatever strength <span
id="fr_829"></span>[830](#fn_829.md) is gained by partaking of them is used
up in the toil and waste of care. Wherefore as no state of life can be
deprived of the virtue of abstinence, so to none is the crown of
perfection denied.

<span id="iv.iii.v.vii-p3"></span> Petschenig’s text in this passage is
as follows: “Facilius vidimus viros qui ab escis corpulentioribus
omnimodis temperarent, quam moderate usos pro necessitate concessis, et
qui totum sibi pro amore continentiæ denegarent, quam qui eas sub
infirmitatis occasione sumentes mensuram sufficientiæ custodirent.”
Gazæus gives something quite different: “Facilius vidimus victos qui ab
escis corpulentioribus omnimodis temperarent, quas moderate usus pro
necessitate concedit, et qui totum sibi pro continentiæ amore
denegarent; quam qui eas sub infirmitatis occasione sumentes mensuram
sufficientiæ custodirent.”

fortitudinis*.—Petschenig. Gazæus has “*Quid quid enim fortitudinis
causa*.”
