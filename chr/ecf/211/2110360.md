#### <span id="iv.iii.iv.xxxi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXI.

<span id="iv.iii.iv.xxxi-p1"></span>How when Abbot Pinufius was brought
back to his monastery he stayed there for a little while and then fled
again into the regions of Syrian Palestine.

<span id="iv.iii.iv.xxxi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.iv.xxxi-p2.1"></span>And</span> when he had stopped there for
a little while, again he was seized with a longing and desire for
humility, and, taking advantage of the silence of night, made his escape
in such a way that this time he sought no neighbouring district, but
regions which were unknown and strange and separated by a wide distance.
For embarking in a ship he managed to travel to Palestine, believing
that he would more <span id="page_230">p. 230</span> <span
id="iv.iii.iv.xxxi-Page_230"></span>securely lie hid if he betook
himself to those places in which his name had never been heard. And when
he had come thither, at once he sought out our own monastery <span
id="fr_790"></span>[791](#fn_790.md) which was at no great distance from
the cave <span id="fr_791"></span>[792](#fn_791.md) in which our Lord
vouchsafed to be born of a virgin. And though he concealed himself here
for some time, yet like “a city set on an hill” <span
id="fr_792"></span>[793](#fn_792) (to use our Lord’s expression.md) he
could not long be hid. For presently some of the brethren who had come
to the holy places from Egypt to pray there recognized him and recalled
him with most fervent prayers to his own Cœnobium.
