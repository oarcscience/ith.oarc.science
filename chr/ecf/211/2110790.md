#### <span id="iv.iv.x.xx-p0.1"></span>Chapter XX.

<span id="iv.iv.x.xx-p1"></span>Of the clause “Thy will be done.”

<span id="iv.iv.x.xx-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.x.xx-p2.1"></span>The</span> third petition is that of sons:
“Thy will be done as in heaven so on earth.” There can now be no grander
prayer than to wish that earthly things may be made equal with things
heavenly: for what else is it to say “Thy will be done as in heaven so
on earth,” than to ask that men may be like angels and that as God’s
will is ever fulfilled by them in heaven, so also all those who are on
earth may do not their own but His will? This too no one could say from
the heart but only one who believed that God disposes for our good all
things which are seen, whether fortunate or unfortunate, and that He is
more careful and provident for our good and salvation than we ourselves
are for ourselves. Or at any rate it may be taken in this way: The will
of God is the salvation of all men, according to these words of the
blessed Paul: “Who willeth all men to be saved and to come to the
knowledge of the truth.” <span id="fr_1611"></span>[1612](#fn_1611) Of
which will also the prophet Isaiah says in the Person of God the Father:
“And all Thy will shall be done.” <span
id="fr_1612"></span>[1613](#fn_1612) When we say then “Thy will be done
as in heaven so on earth,” we pray in other words for this; viz., that
as those who are in heaven, so also may all those who dwell on earth be
saved, O Father, by the knowledge of Thee.
