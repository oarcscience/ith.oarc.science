#### <span id="iv.v.v.xiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIV.

<span id="iv.v.v.xiv-p1"></span>How an unclean soul can neither give nor
receive spiritual knowledge.

<span id="iv.v.v.xiv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.v.xiv-p2.1"></span>But</span> it is, as we have already said,
impossible for a novice either to understand or to teach this. For if
one is incapable of receiving it how can he be fit to pass it on to
another? But if he has had the audacity to teach anything on these
matters, most certainly his words will be idle and useless and only
reach the ears of his hearers, without being able to touch their hearts,
uttered as they were in sheer idleness and unfruitful vanity, for they
do not proceed from the treasure of a good conscience, but from the
empty impertinence of boastfulness. For it is impossible for an impure
soul (however earnestly it may devote itself to reading) to obtain
spiritual knowledge. For no one pours any rich ointment or fine honey or
any precious liquid into a dirty and stinking vessel. For a jar that has
once been filled with foul odours spoils the sweetest myrrh more readily
than it receives any sweetness or grace from it, for what is pure is
corrupted much more quickly than what is corrupt is purified. And so the
vessel of our bosom unless it has first been purified from all the foul
stains of sin will not be worthy to receive that blessed ointment of
which it is said by the prophet: “Like the ointment upon the head, which
ran down upon the beard of Aaron, which ran down upon the edge of his
garment,” <span id="fr_1907"></span>[1908](#fn_1907.md) nor will it keep
undefiled that spiritual knowledge and the words of Scripture which are
“sweeter than honey and the honeycomb.” <span
id="fr_1908"></span>[1909](#fn_1908.md) “For what share hath righteousness
with iniquity? or what agreement hath light with darkness? or what
concord has Christ with Belial?” <span
id="fr_1909"></span>[1910](#fn_1909.md)
