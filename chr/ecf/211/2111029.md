#### <span id="iv.vi.v.xxix-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXIX.

<span id="iv.vi.v.xxix-p1"></span>How those who are perfect go beyond
the fixed rule of Lent.

<span id="iv.vi.v.xxix-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.v.xxix-p2.1"></span>By</span> this law of Lent then the man
who is upright and perfect is not restrained nor is he content with
merely submitting to that paltry rule which the heads of the church have
established for those who all the year round are involved in pleasure or
business, that they may be bound by this legal requirement and forced at
any rate during these days to find time for the Lord, and dedicate to
Him the tithe of the days of their life, all of which they would have
consumed as their profits. But the righteous, for whom the law is not
appointed, and who devote to spiritual duties not a small part; viz.,
the tenth, but the whole time of their life, because they are free from
the burden of tithes according to law, for this reason, if any worthy
and pious occasion happening to them constrains them, are ready to relax
their station fast <span id="fr_2211"></span>[2212](#fn_2211.md) without
any hesitation. For in their case it is no paltry tithe that is
diminished, as they offer all that they have to the Lord equally with
themselves. And this certainly a man could not do without being guilty
of a grievous wrong, who, offering nothing of his own free will to God,
is forced to pay his tithes by the stern compulsion of the law which
takes no excuse. Wherefore it is clearly established that the servant of
the law cannot be perfect, who only shuns those things which are
forbidden and does those things which are commanded, but that those are
really perfect who do not take advantage even of those things which the
law allows. And in this way, though it is said of the Mosaic law that
“the law brought nothing to perfection,” <span
id="fr_2212"></span>[2213](#fn_2212.md) we read that some of the saints in
the Old Testament were perfect because they went beyond the commands of
the law and lived under the perfection of the Gospel: “Knowing that the
law is not appointed for the righteous but for the unrighteous and
disobedient, for the ungodly and sinners, for the wicked and defiled,
etc.” <span id="fr_2213"></span>[2214](#fn_2213.md)
