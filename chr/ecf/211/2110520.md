#### <span id="iv.iii.xi.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.

<span id="iv.iii.xi.ix-p1"></span>That vainglory is the more dangerous
through being mixed up with virtues.

<span id="iv.iii.xi.ix-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.xi.ix-p2.1"></span>Lastly</span>, other passions which are
entirely different from the virtues which are their opposites, and which
attack us openly and as it were in broad daylight, are more easily
overcome and guarded against: but this being interwoven with our virtues
and entangled in the battle, fighting as it were under cover of the
darkness of night, deceives the more dangerously those who are off their
guard and not on the lookout.
