<span id="iv.iv.iii.iv"></span>

#### <span id="iv.iv.iii.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.iv-p1"></span>What is said of the value of
discretion in Holy Scripture.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.iv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.iii.iv-p2.1"></span>Such</span> is discretion, which is not
only the “light of the body,” but also called the sun by the Apostle, as
it said “Let not the sun go down upon your wrath.” <span
id="fr_1167"></span>[1168](#fn_1167.md) It is also called the guidance of
our life: as it said “Those who have no guidance, fall like
leaves.” <span id="fr_1168"></span>[1169](#fn_1168.md) It is most truly
named counsel, without which the authority of Scripture allows us to do
nothing, so that we are not even permitted to take that spiritual “wine
which maketh glad the heart of man” <span
id="fr_1169"></span>[1170](#fn_1169.md) without its regulating control: as
it is said “Do everything with counsel, drink thy wine with
counsel,” <span id="fr_1170"></span>[1171](#fn_1170.md) and again “like a
city that has its walls destroyed and is not fenced in, so is a man who
does anything without counsel.” <span
id="fr_1171"></span>[1172](#fn_1171.md) And how injurious the absence of
this is to a monk, the illustration and figure in the passage quoted
shows, by comparing it to a city that is destroyed and without walls.
Herein lies wisdom, herein lies intelligence and understanding without
which our inward house cannot be built, nor can spiritual riches be
gathered together, as it is said: “A house is built with wisdom, and
again it is set up with intelligence. With understanding the storehouses
are filled with all precious riches and good things.” <span
id="fr_1172"></span>[1173](#fn_1172.md) This I say is “solid food,” which
can only be taken by those who are full grown and strong, as it is said:
“But solid food is for full grown men, who by reason of use have their
senses exercised to discern good and evil.” <span
id="fr_1173"></span>[1174](#fn_1173.md) And it is shown to be useful and
necessary for us, only in so far as it is in accordance with the word of
God and its powers, as is said “For the word of God is quick and
powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and reaching even to the
dividing asunder of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and a
discerner <span id="page_310">p. 310</span> <span
id="iv.iv.iii.iv-Page_310"></span>of the thoughts and intents of the
heart:” <span id="fr_1174"></span>[1175](#fn_1174.md) and by this it is
clearly shown that no virtue can possibly be perfectly acquired or
continue without the grace of discretion. And so by the judgment of the
blessed Antony as well as of all others it has been laid down that it is
discretion which leads a fearless monk by fixed stages to God, and
preserves the virtues mentioned above continually intact, by means of
which one may ascend with less weariness to the extreme summit of
perfection, and without which even those who toil most willingly cannot
reach the heights of perfection. For discretion is the mother of all
virtues, as well as their guardian and regulator.
