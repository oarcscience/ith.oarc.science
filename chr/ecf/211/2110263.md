#### <span id="iii.xxii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXI.

<span id="iii.xxii-p1"></span>Exposition of St. Paul’s Words.—[1 Tim.
vi. 20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#020)<span
id="iii.xxii-p1.1"></span>.

<span id="iii.xxii-p2"></span>\[51.\] <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.xxii-p2.1"></span>Such</span> being the case, when I think over
these things, and revolve them in my mind again and again, I cannot
sufficiently wonder at the madness of certain men, at the impiety of
their blinded understanding, at their lust of error, such that, not
content with the rule of faith delivered once for all, and received from
the times of old, they are every day seeking one novelty after another,
and are constantly longing to add, change, take away, in religion, as
though the doctrine, “Let what has once for all been revealed suffice,”
were not a heavenly but an earthly rule,—a rule which could not be
complied with except by continual emendation, nay, rather by continual
fault-finding; whereas the divine Oracles cry aloud, “Remove not the
landmarks, which thy fathers have set,” <span
id="fr_494"></span>[495](#fn_494) and “Go not to law with a
Judge,” <span id="fr_495"></span>[496](#fn_495) and “Whoso breaketh
through a fence a serpent shall bite him,” <span
id="fr_496"></span>[497](#fn_496) and that saying of the Apostle
wherewith, <span id="page_147">p. 147</span> <span
id="iii.xxii-Page_147"></span>as with a spiritual sword, all the wicked
novelties of all heresies often have been, and will always have to be,
decapitated, “O Timothy, keep the deposit, shunning profane novelties of
words and oppositions of the knowledge falsely so called, which some
professing have erred concerning the faith.” <span
id="fr_497"></span>[498](#fn_497)

<span id="iii.xxii-p7"></span>\[52.\] After words such as these, is
there any one of so hardened a front, such anvil-like impudence, such
adamantine pertinacity, as not to succumb to so huge a mass, not to be
crushed by so ponderous a weight, not to be shaken in pieces by such
heavy blows, not to be annihilated by such dreadful thunderbolts of
divine eloquence? “Shun profane novelties,” he says. He does not say
shun “antiquity.” But he plainly points to what ought to follow by the
rule of contrary. For if novelty is to be shunned, antiquity is to be
held fast; if novelty is profane, antiquity is sacred. He adds, “And
oppositions of science falsely so called.” “Falsely called” indeed, as
applied to the doctrines of heretics, where ignorance is disguised under
the name of knowledge, fog of sunshine, darkness of light. “Which some
professing have erred concerning the faith.” Professing what? What but
some (I know not what) new and unheard-of doctrine. For thou mayest hear
some of these same doctors say, “Come, O silly wretches, who go by the
name of Catholics, come and learn the true faith, which no one but
ourselves is acquainted with, which same has lain hid these many ages,
but has recently been revealed and made manifest. But learn it by
stealth and in secret, for you will be delighted with it. Moreover, when
you have learnt it, teach it furtively, that the world may not hear,
that the Church may not know. For there are but few to whom it is
granted to receive the secret of so great a mystery.” Are not these the
words of that harlot who, in the proverbs of Solomon, calls to the
passengers who go right on their ways, “Whoso is simple let him turn in
hither.” And as for them that are void of understanding, she exhorts
them saying: “Drink stolen waters, for they are sweet, and eat bread in
secret for it is pleasant.” What next? “But he knoweth not that the sons
of earth perish in her house.” <span id="fr_498"></span>[499](#fn_498)
Who are those “sons of earth”? Let the apostle explain: “Those who have
erred concerning the faith.”
