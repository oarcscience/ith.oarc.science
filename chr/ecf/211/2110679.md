<span id="iv.iv.vi.xvi"></span>

#### <span id="iv.iv.vi.xvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVI.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.xvi-p1"></span>Of the meaning of the seven nations of
whose lands Israel took possession, and the reason why they are
sometimes spoken of as “seven,” and sometimes as “many.”

<span id="iv.iv.vi.xvi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.vi.xvi-p2.1"></span>These</span> are the seven nations whose
lands the Lord promised to give to the children of Israel when they came
out of Egypt. And everything which, as the Apostle says, happened to
them “in a figure” <span id="fr_1343"></span>[1344](#fn_1343) we ought
to take as written for our correction. For so we read: “When the Lord
thy God shall have brought thee into the land, which thou art going in
to possess, and shall have destroyed many nations before thee, the
Hittite, and the Girgashites, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, and the
Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, seven nations much more
numerous than thou art and much stronger than thou: and the Lord thy God
shall have delivered them to thee, thou shalt utterly destroy
them.” <span id="fr_1344"></span>[1345](#fn_1344) And the reason that
they are said to be much more numerous, is that faults are many more in
number than virtues and so in the list of them the nations are reckoned
as seven in number, but when the attack upon them is spoken of they are
set down without their number being given, for thus we read “And shall
have destroyed many nations before thee.” For the race of carnal
passions which springs from this sevenfold incentive and root of sin, is
more numerous than that of Israel. For thence spring up murders,
strifes, heresies, thefts, false witness, blasphemy, surfeiting,
drunkenness, back-biting, buffoonery, filthy conversation, lies,
perjury, foolish talking, scurrility, restlessness, greediness,
bitterness, clamour, wrath, contempt, murmuring, temptation, despair,
and many other faults, which it would take too long to describe. And if
we are inclined to think these small matters, let us hear what the
Apostle thought about them, and what was his opinion of them: “Neither
murmur ye,” says he, “as some of them murmured, and were destroyed of
the destroyer:” and of temptation: “Neither let us tempt Christ as some
of them tempted and perished by the serpents.” <span
id="fr_1345"></span>[1346](#fn_1345) Of backbiting: “Love not backbiting
lest thou be rooted out.” <span id="fr_1346"></span>[1347](#fn_1346) And
of despair: “Who despairing have given themselves up to lasciviousness
unto the working of all error, in uncleanness.” <span
id="fr_1347"></span>[1348](#fn_1347) And that clamour is condemned as
well as anger and indignation and blasphemy, the words of the same
Apostle teach us as clearly as possible when he thus charges us: “Let
all bitterness, and anger, and indignation, and clamour, and blasphemy
be put away from you with all malice,” <span
id="fr_1348"></span>[1349](#fn_1348) and many more things like these.
And though these are far more numerous than the virtues are, yet if
those eight principal sins, from which we know that these naturally
proceed, are first overcome, all these at once sink down, and are
destroyed together with them with a lasting destruction. For from
gluttony proceed surfeiting and drunkenness. From fornication filthy
conversation, scurrility, buffoonery and foolish talking. From
covetousness, lying, deceit, theft, perjury, the desire of filthy lucre,
false witness, violence, inhumanity, and greed. From anger, murders,
clamour and indignation. From dejection, rancor, cowardice, bitterness,
despair. From accidie, laziness, sleepiness, rudeness, restlessness,
wandering about, instability both of mind and body, chattering,
inquisitiveness. From vainglory, contention, heresies, boasting and
confidence in novelties. From pride, contempt, envy, disobedience,
blasphemy, murmuring, backbiting. And that all these plagues are
stronger than we, we can tell very plainly from the way in which they
attack us. For the delight in carnal passions wars more powerfully in
our members than does the desire for virtue, which is only gained with
the greatest contrition of heart and body. But if you will only gaze
with the eyes of the spirit on those countless hosts of our foes, which
the Apostle enumerates where he says: “For we wrestle not against flesh
and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the
world-rulers of this darkness, against spiritual wickedness in heavenly
places,” <span id="fr_1349"></span>[1350](#fn_1349) and this which we
find of the righteous <span id="page_348">p. 348</span> <span
id="iv.iv.vi.xvi-Page_348"></span>man in the nineteenth Psalm: “A
thousand shall fall beside thee and ten thousand at thy right
hand,” <span id="fr_1350"></span>[1351](#fn_1350) then you will clearly
see that they are far more numerous and more powerful than are we,
carnal and earthly creatures as we are, while to them is given a
substance which is spiritual and incorporeal.
