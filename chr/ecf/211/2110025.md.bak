#### <span id="ii.ii.xxii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXI.

<span id="ii.ii.xxii-p1"></span>Martin has to do both with Angels and
Devils.

<span id="ii.ii.xxii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.ii.xxii-p2.1"></span>It</span> is also well known that angels
were very often seen by him, so that they spoke in turns with him in set
speech. As to the devil, Martin held him so visible and ever under the
power of his eyes, that whether he kept himself in his proper form, or
changed himself into different shapes of spiritual wickedness, he was
perceived by Martin, under whatever guise he appeared. The devil knew
well that he could not escape discovery, and therefore frequently heaped
insults upon Martin, being unable to beguile him by trickery. On one
occasion the devil, holding in his hand the bloody horn of an ox, rushed
into Martin’s cell with great noise, and holding out to him his bloody
right hand, while at the same time he exulted in the crime he had
committed, said: “Where, O Martin, is thy power? I have just slain one
of your people.” Then Martin assembled the brethren, and related to them
what the devil had disclosed, while he ordered them carefully to search
the several cells in order to discover who had been visited with this
calamity. They report that no one of the monks was missing, but that one
peasant, hired by them, had gone to the forest to bring home wood in his
wagon. Upon hearing this, Martin instructs some of them to go and meet
him. On their doing so, the man was found almost dead at no great
distance from the monastery. Nevertheless, although just drawing his
last breath, he made known to the brethren the cause of his wound and
death. He said that, while he was drawing tighter the thongs which had
got loose on the oxen yoked together, one of the oxen, throwing his head
free, had wounded him with his horn in the groin. And not long after the
man expired. You <span id="fr_35"></span>[36](#fn_35.md) see with what
judgment of the Lord this power was given to the devil. This was a
marvelous feature in Martin that not only on this occasion to which I
have specially referred, but on many occasions of the same kind, in fact
as often as such things occurred, he perceived them long beforehand,
and <span id="fr_36"></span>[37](#fn_36.md) disclosed the things which had
been revealed to him to the brethren.
