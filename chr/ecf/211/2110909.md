#### <span id="iv.v.vii.xviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.

<span id="iv.v.vii.xviii-p1"></span>Of those who pretend to patience but
excite their brethren to anger by their silence.

<span id="iv.v.vii.xviii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.vii.xviii-p2.1"></span>But</span> what sort of a thing is this,
that sometimes we fancy that we are patient because when provoked we
scorn to answer, but by sullen silence or scornful motions and gestures
so mock at our angry brothers that by our silent looks we provoke them
to anger more than angry reproaches would have excited them, meanwhile
thinking that we are in no way guilty before God, because we have let
nothing fall from our lips which could brand us or condemn us in the
judgment of men. As if in the sight of God mere words, and not mainly
the will was called in fault, and as if only the actual deed of sin, and
not also the wish and purpose, was reckoned as wrong; or as if it would
be asked in the judgment only what each one had done and not what he
also purposed to do. For it is not only the character of the anger
roused, but also the purpose of the man who provokes it which is bad,
and therefore the true scrutiny of our judge will ask, not how the
quarrel was stirred up but by whose fault it arose: for the purpose of
the sin, and not the way in which the fault is committed must be taken
into account. For what does it matter whether a man kills a brother with
a sword by himself, or drives him to death by some fraud, when it is
clear that he is killed by his wiles and crime? As if it were enough not
to have pushed a blind man down with one’s own hand, though he is
equally guilty who scorned to save him, when it was in his power, when
fallen and on the point of tumbling into the ditch: or as if he alone
were guilty who had caught a man with the hand, and not also the one who
had prepared and set the trap for him, or who would not set him free
when he might have done so. So then it is of no good to hold one’s
tongue, if we impose silence upon ourselves for this reason that by our
silence we may do what would have been done by an outcry on our part,
simulating certain gestures by which he whom we ought to have cured, may
be made still more angry, while we are commended for all this, to his
loss and damage: as if a man were not for this very reason the more
guilty, because he tried to get glory for himself out of his brother’s
fall. For such a silence will be equally bad for both because while it
increases the vexation in the heart of another, so it prevents it from
being removed from one’s own: and against such persons the prophet’s
curse is with good reason directed: “Woe to him that giveth drink to his
friend, and presenteth his gall, and maketh him drunk, that he may
behold his nakedness. He is filled with shame instead of glory.” <span
id="fr_1990"></span>[1991](#fn_1990) And this too which is said of such
people by another: “For every brother will utterly supplant, and every
friend will walk deceitfully. And a man shall mock his brother, and they
will not speak the truth, for they have bent their tongue like a bow for
lies and not for truth.” <span id="fr_1991"></span>[1992](#fn_1991) But
often a feigned patience excites to anger more keenly than words, and a
spiteful silence exceeds the most awful insults in words, and the wounds
of enemies are more easily borne than the deceitful blandishment of
mockers, of which it is well said by the prophet: “Their words are
smoother than oil, and yet they are darts:” and elsewhere “the words of
the crafty are soft: but they smite within the belly:” to which this
also may be finely applied: “With the mouth he speaks peace to his
friend, but secretly he layeth snares for him;” with which however the
deceiver is rather deceived, for “if a man prepares a net before his
friend, it surrounds his own feet;” and: “if a man digs a pit for his
neighbour, he shall fall into it himself.” <span
id="fr_1992"></span>[1993](#fn_1992) Lastly when a great multitude had
come with swords and staves to take the Lord, none of the murderers of
the author of our life stood forth as more cruel than he who advanced
before them all with a counterfeit respect and salutation and offered a
kiss of feigned love; to whom the Lord said: “Judas, betrayest thou the
Son of man with a kiss?” <span id="fr_1993"></span>[1994](#fn_1993)
i.e., the bitterness <span id="page_457">p. 457</span> <span
id="iv.v.vii.xviii-Page_457"></span>of thy persecution and hatred has
taken as a cloke this which expresses the sweetness of true love. More
openly too and more energetically does He emphasize the force of this
grief by the prophet, saying: “For if mine enemy had cursed me, I would
have borne it: and if he who hated me had spoken great things against
me, I would have hid myself from him. But it was thou, a man of one
mind, my guide, and my familiar friend: who didst take sweet meats
together with me: in the house of God we walked with consent.” <span
