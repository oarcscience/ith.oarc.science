#### <span id="iv.iv.ix.xiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIV.

<span id="iv.iv.ix.xiv-p1"></span>How it is that spiritual wickednesses
obtained the names of powers or principalities.

<span id="iv.iv.ix.xiv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.ix.xiv-p2.1"></span>We</span> can then see clear reasons, in
addition to those ideas which we expounded above, why they are called
principalities or powers; viz., because they rule and preside over
different nations, and at least hold sway over inferior spirits and
demons, of which the gospels give us evidence by their own confession
that there exist legions. For they could not be called lords unless they
had some over whom to exercise the sway of lordship; nor could they be
called powers or principalities, unless there were some over whom they
could claim power: and this we find pointed out very clearly in the
gospel by the Pharisees in their blasphemy: “He casteth out devils by
Beelzebub the prince of the devils,” <span
id="fr_1538"></span>[1539](#fn_1538.md) for we find that they are also
called “rulers of darkness,” <span id="fr_1539"></span>[1540](#fn_1539.md)
and that one of them is styled “the prince of this world.” <span
id="fr_1540"></span>[1541](#fn_1540.md) But the blessed Apostle declares
that hereafter, when all things shall be subdued to Christ, these orders
shall be destroyed, saying: “When He shall have delivered up the kingdom
to God even the Father, when He shall have destroyed all principalities
and powers and dominions.” <span id="fr_1541"></span>[1542](#fn_1541.md)
And this certainly can only take place if they are removed from the sway
of those over whom we know that powers and dominions and principalities
take charge in this world.
