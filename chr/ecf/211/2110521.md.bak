#### <span id="iv.iii.xi.x-p0.1"></span>Chapter X.

<span id="iv.iii.xi.x-p1"></span>An instance showing how King Hezekiah
was overthrown by the dart of vainglory.

<span id="iv.iii.xi.x-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.xi.x-p2.1"></span>For</span> so we read that Hezekiah, King
of Judah, a man of most perfect righteousness in all things, and one
approved by the witness of Holy Scripture, after unnumbered
commendations for his virtues, was overthrown by a single dart of
vainglory. And he who by a single prayer of his was able to procure the
death of a hundred and eighty-five thousand of the army of the
Assyrians, whom the angel destroyed in one night, is overcome by
boasting and vanity. Of whom—to pass over the long list of his virtues,
which it would take a long time to unfold—I will say but this one thing.
He was a man who, after the close of his life had been decreed and the
day of his death determined by the Lord’s sentence, prevailed by a
single prayer to extend the limits set to his life by fifteen years, the
sun returning by ten steps, on which it had already shone in its course
towards its setting, and by its return dispersing those lines which the
shadow that followed its course had already marked, and by this giving
two days in one to the whole world, by a stupendous miracle contrary to
the fixed laws of nature. <span id="fr_1008"></span>[1009](#fn_1008.md) Yet
after signs so great and so incredible, after such immense proofs of his
goodness, hear the Scripture tell how he was destroyed by his very
successes. “In those days,” we are told, “Hezekiah was sick unto death:
and he prayed to the Lord, and He heard him and gave him a sign,” that,
namely of which we read in the fourth book of the kingdoms, which was
given by Isaiah the prophet through the going back of the sun. “But,” it
says, “he did not render again according to the benefits which he had
received, for his heart was lifted up; and wrath was kindled against him
and against Judah and Jerusalem: and he humbled himself afterwards
because his heart had been lifted up, both he and the inhabitants of
Jerusalem, and therefore the wrath of the Lord came not upon them in the
days of Hezekiah.” <span id="fr_1009"></span>[1010](#fn_1009.md) How
dangerous, how terrible is the malady of vanity! So much goodness, so
many virtues, faith and devotion, great enough to prevail to change
nature itself and the laws of the whole world, perish by a single act of
pride! So that all his good deeds would have been forgotten as if they
had never been, and he would at once have been subject to the wrath of
the Lord unless he had appeased Him by recovering his humility: so that
he who, at the suggestion of pride, had fallen from so great a height of
excellence, could only mount again to the height he had lost by the same
steps of humility. Do you want to see another instance of a similar
downfall?
