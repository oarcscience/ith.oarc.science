#### <span id="ii.iv.iii.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.

<span id="ii.iv.iii.v-p1"></span>“<span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.iii.v-p1.1"></span>While</span> these are certain facts, since
Avitianus related them to many persons, they are further confirmed on
this ground that Refrigerius the presbyter, whom you see here present,
lately had them narrated to him, under an appeal to the Divine majesty,
by Dagridus, a faithful man among the tribunes, who swore that the
account was given him by Avitianus himself. But I do not wish you to
wonder that I do to-day what I did not do yesterday; viz. that I subjoin
to the mention of every individual wonder the names of witnesses, and
mention persons to whom, if any one is inclined to disbelieve, he may
have recourse, because they are still in the body. The unbelief of very
many has compelled that; for they are said to hesitate about some things
which were related yesterday. Let these people, then, accept as
witnesses persons who are still alive and well, and let them give more
credit to such, inasmuch as they doubt our good faith. But really, if
they are so unbelieving, I give it as my opinion that they will not
believe even the witnesses named. And yet I am surprised that any one,
who has even the least sense of religion, can venture on such wickedness
as to think that any one could tell lies concerning Martin. Be that far
from every one who lives in obedience to God; for, indeed, Martin does
not require to be defended by falsehoods. But, O Christ, we lay the
truth of our whole discourse before thee, to the effect that we neither
have said, nor will say, anything else than what either we ourselves
have witnessed, or have learned from undoubted authorities, and, indeed,
very frequently from Martin himself. But although we have adopted the
form of a dialogue, in order that the style might be varied to prevent
weariness, still we affirm that we are really setting forth <span
id="fr_131"></span>[132](#fn_131.md) a true history in a dutiful spirit.
The unbelief of some has compelled me, to my great regret, to insert in
my narrative these remarks which are apart from the subject in hand. But
let the discourse now return to our assembly; in which since I saw that
I was listened to so eagerly, I found it necessary to acknowledge that
Aper acted properly in keeping back the unbelieving, under the
conviction he had that those only ought to be allowed to hear who were
of a believing spirit.
