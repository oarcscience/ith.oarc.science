#### <span id="iv.v.vii.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.

<span id="iv.v.vii.iv-p1"></span>A question whether anything that is
really useful should be performed even against a brother’s wish.

<span id="iv.v.vii.iv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.vii.iv-p2.1"></span>Germanus</span>: What then? If when one
party wants to do something which he sees is useful and profitable
according to the mind of God, the other does not give his consent, ought
it to be performed even against the wish of the brother, or should it be
thrown on one side as he wants?

among those who are perfect.](2110896)
