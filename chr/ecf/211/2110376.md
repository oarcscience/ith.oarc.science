#### <span id="iv.iii.v.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.

<span id="iv.iii.v.iii-p1"></span>How our first struggle must be against
the spirit of gluttony, i.e. the pleasures of the palate.

<span id="iv.iii.v.iii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.v.iii-p2.1"></span>And</span> so the first conflict we must
enter upon is that against gluttony, which we have explained as the
pleasures of the palate: and in the first place as we are going to speak
of the system of fasts, and the quality of food, we must again recur to
the traditions and customs of the Egyptians, as everybody knows that
they contain a more advanced discipline in the matter of self-control,
and a perfect method of discrimination.
