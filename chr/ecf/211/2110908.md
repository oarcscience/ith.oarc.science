#### <span id="iv.v.vii.xvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVII.

<span id="iv.v.vii.xvii-p1"></span>Of those who hold that patience
should be shown to worldly people rather than to the brethren.

<span id="iv.v.vii.xvii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.vii.xvii-p2.1"></span>This</span> too should be bitterly
lamented; namely, that some of the brethren, when angered by some
reproachful words, if they are besieged by the prayers of some one else
who wants to smooth them down, when they hear that vexation ought not to
be admitted or retained against a brother, according to what is written:
“Whoever is angry with his brother is in danger of the judgment;” and:
“Let not the sun go down upon your wrath,” <span
id="fr_1989"></span>[1990](#fn_1989.md) instantly assert that if a heathen
or one living in the world had said or done this, it rightly ought to be
endured. But who could stand a brother who was accessory to so great a
fault, or gave utterance to so insolent a reproach with his lips! As if
patience were to be shown only to unbelievers and blasphemers, and not
to all in general, or as if anger should be reckoned as bad when it is
against <span id="page_456">p. 456</span> <span
id="iv.v.vii.xvii-Page_456"></span>a heathen, but good when it is
against a brother; whereas certainly the obstinate rage of an angry soul
brings about the same injury to one’s self whoever may be the subject
against whom it is aroused. But how terribly obstinate, aye and
senseless is it for them, owing to the stupidity of their dull mind, not
to be able to discern the meaning of these words, for it is not said:
“Every one who is angry with a stranger shall be in danger of the
judgment,” which might perhaps according to their interpretation except
those who are partners of our faith and life, but the word of the Gospel
most significantly expresses it by saying: “Every one who is angry with
his brother, shall be in danger of the judgment.” And so though we ought
according to the rule of truth to regard every man as a brother, yet in
this passage one of the faithful and a partaker of our mode of life is
denoted by the title of brother rather than a heathen.
