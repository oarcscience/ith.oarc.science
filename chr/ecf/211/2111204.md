#### <span id="iv.vii.viii.xxix-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXIX.

<span id="iv.vii.viii.xxix-p1"></span>In the next place he puts the
authority of S. Athanasius.

<span id="iv.vii.viii.xxix-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.viii.xxix-p2.1"></span>Athanasius</span> also, priest of the
city of Alexandria, a splendid instance of constancy and virtue, whom
the storm of heretical persecution tested without crushing him: whose
life was always like a clear glass, and who had almost obtained the
reward of martyrdom before attaining the dignity of confessorship: Let
us see what was his view of the Lord Jesus Christ and the mother of the
Lord. “This then,” he says, “is the mind and stamp of Holy Scripture, as
we have often said; viz., that in one and the same Saviour two things
have to be understood: (1) that He was ever God, and is Son, Word, and
Light, and Wisdom of the Father, and (2) that afterwards for our sakes
He took flesh of the Virgin Mary the Theotocos, and was made man.” <span
id="fr_2677"></span>[2678](#fn_2677) Again after some other matter:
“Many then were saints and clean from sin: Jeremiah also was sanctified
from the womb, and John, while still in the womb leapt for joy at the
voice of Mary the Theotocos.” <span id="fr_2678"></span>[2679](#fn_2678)
He certainly says that God, the Son of God, who (to declare the faith of
all in his words) is “the Word, and Light and Wisdom of the Father,”
took flesh for our sakes; and therefore he calls the Virgin Mary
Theotocos, because she was the Mother of God.
