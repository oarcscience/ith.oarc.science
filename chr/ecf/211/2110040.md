#### <span id="ii.iv.i.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.

<span id="ii.iv.i.iii-p1"></span>“<span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.i.iii-p1.1"></span>Three</span> years ago, Sulpitius, at which
time, leaving this neighborhood, I bade thee farewell, after setting
sail from Narbonne, on the fifth day we entered a port of Africa: so
prosperous, by the will of God, had been the voyage. I had in my mind a
great desire to go to Carthage, to visit those localities connected with
the saints, and, above all, to worship at the tomb <span
id="fr_83"></span>[84](#fn_83) of the martyr Cyprian. On the fifth day
we returned to the harbor, and launched forth into the deep. Our
destination was Alexandria; but as the south wind was against us, we
were almost driven upon the Syrtis; <span id="fr_84"></span>[85](#fn_84)
the cautious sailors, however, guarding against this, stopped the ship
by casting anchor. The continent of Africa then lay before our eyes;
and, landing on it in boats, when we perceived that the whole country
round was destitute of human cultivation, I penetrated farther inland,
for the purpose of more carefully exploring the locality. About three
miles from the sea-coast, I beheld a small hut in the midst of the sand,
the roof of which, to use the expression <span
id="fr_85"></span>[86](#fn_85) of Sallust, was like the keel of a ship.
It was close to <span id="fr_86"></span>[87](#fn_86) the earth, and was
floored with good strong boards, not because any very heavy rains are
there feared (for, in fact, such a thing as rain has there never even
been heard of), but because, such is the strength of the winds in that
district, that, if at any time only a little breath of air begins there
to be felt, even when the weather is pretty mild, a greater wreckage
takes place in those lands than on any sea. No plants are there, and no
seeds ever spring up, since, in such shifting soil, the dry sand is
swept along with every motion of the winds. But where some promontories,
back from the sea, act as a check to the winds, the soil, being somewhat
more firm, produces here and there some prickly grass, and that
furnishes fair pasturage for sheep. The inhabitants live on milk, while
those of them that are more skillful, or, so to speak, more wealthy,
make use of barley bread. That is the only kind of grain which
flourishes there, for barley, by the quickness of its growth in that
sort of soil, generally escapes the destruction caused by the fierce
winds. So rapid is its growth that we are told it is ripe on the
thirtieth day after the sowing of the seed. But there is no reason why
men should settle there, except that all are free from the payment of
taxes. The sea-coast of the Cyrenians is indeed the most remote,
bordering upon that desert which lies between Egypt and Africa, <span
id="fr_87"></span>[88](#fn_87) and through which Cato formerly, when
fleeing from Cæsar, led an army. <span id="fr_88"></span>[89](#fn_88)

<span id="ii.iv.i.iii-p3"></span> This was probably the Syrtis Minor, a
dangerous sandbank in the sea on the northern coast of Africa; it is now
known as the Gulf of Cabes. The Syrtis Major lay farther to the east,
and now bears the name of the Gulf of Sidra.
