#### <span id="iv.iv.iii.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.vi-p1"></span>Of the destruction of two brethren for
lack of discretion.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.vi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.iii.vi-p2.1"></span>What</span> shall I say of those two
brethren who lived beyond that desert of the Thebaid where once the
blessed Antony dwelt, and, not being sufficiently influenced by careful
discrimination, when they were going through the vast and extended waste
determined not to take any food with them, except such as the Lord
Himself might provide for them. And when as they wandered through the
deserts and were already fainting from hunger they were spied at a
distance by the Mazices <span id="fr_1178"></span>[1179](#fn_1178.md) (a
race which is even more savage and ferocious than almost all wild
tribes, for they are not driven to shed blood, as other tribes are, from
desire of spoil but from simple ferocity of mind), and when these acting
contrary to their natural ferocity, met them with bread, one of the two
as discretion came to his aid, received it with delight and thankfulness
as if it were offered to him by the Lord, thinking that the food <span
id="page_311">p. 311</span> <span id="iv.iv.iii.vi-Page_311"></span>had
been divinely provided for him, and that it was God’s doing that those
who always delighted in bloodshed had offered the staff of life to men
who were already fainting and dying; but the other refused the food
because it was offered to him by men and died of starvation. And though
this sprang in the first instance from a persuasion that was
blame-worthy yet one of them by the help of discretion got the better of
the idea which he had rashly and carelessly conceived, but the other
persisting in his obstinate folly, and being utterly lacking in
discretion, brought upon himself that death which the Lord would have
averted, as he would not believe that it was owing to a Divine impulse
that the fierce barbarians forgot their natural ferocity and offered
them bread instead of a sword.
