#### <span id="iv.vii.viii.xvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVII.

<span id="iv.vii.viii.xvii-p1"></span>That the glory and honour of
Christ is not to be ascribed to the Holy Ghost in such a way as to deny
that it proceeds from Christ Himself, as if all that excellency, which
was in Him, was another’s and proceeded from another source.

<span id="iv.vii.viii.xvii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.viii.xvii-p2.1"></span>You</span> say then in another
discussion, nay rather in another blasphemy of yours, “and He
separated <span id="fr_2629"></span>[2630](#fn_2629.md) the Spirit from the
Divine nature Who created His humanity. For Scripture says that that
which was born of Mary is of the Holy Ghost. <span
id="fr_2630"></span>[2631](#fn_2630.md) Who also filled with righteousness
(justitia) that which was created: for it says ‘He appeared in the
flesh, was justified in the Spirit.’ <span
id="fr_2631"></span>[2632](#fn_2631.md) Again: Who made Him also to be
feared by the devils: ‘For I,’ He says, ‘by the Spirit of God cast out
devils.’ <span id="fr_2632"></span>[2633](#fn_2632.md) Who also made His
flesh a temple. ‘For I saw His spirit descending like a dove and abiding
upon Him.’ <span id="fr_2633"></span>[2634](#fn_2633.md) Again: Who granted
to Him His ascension into Heaven. For it says, “Giving a commandment to
the apostles whom He had chosen, by the Holy Ghost He was taken
up.” <span id="fr_2634"></span>[2635](#fn_2634.md) Finally that it was He
who granted such glory to Christ.” The whole of your blasphemy then
consists in this: that Christ had nothing of Himself: nor did He, a mere
man, as you say, receive anything from the Word, i.e., the Son of God;
but everything in Him was the gift of the Spirit. If then we can show
that all that which you refer to the Spirit, is His own, what remains
but that we prove that He whom you therefore would have taken to be a
man, because as you say everything which He has is another’s, is
therefore God, because everything which He has is His own? And indeed we
will prove this not only by discussion and argument, but by the voice of
Divinity Itself: for nothing testifies of God better than things divine.
And because nothing knows itself better than the very glory of God, we
believe nothing on the subject of God with greater right than those
writings in which God Himself is His own witness. First then, as to this
that you say that the Holy Spirit created His humanity; we might take it
simply, if we could acknowledge that you had not brought it forward in
the interests of unbelief. For neither do we deny that the flesh of the
Lord was conceived by the Holy Ghost: but we assert that the body was
conceived by the co-operation of the Holy Ghost in such a way that we
can say that His Humanity <span id="fr_2635"></span>[2636](#fn_2635.md) was
created for Himself by the Son of God, as the Holy Spirit Itself says in
holy Scripture, testifying that “Wisdom hath builded for Itself a
house.” <span id="fr_2636"></span>[2637](#fn_2636.md) You see then that
that which was conceived by the Holy Ghost was built and perfected by
the Son of God: not that the work of the Son of God is one thing, and
the work of the Holy Ghost another: but that through the unity of the
Godhead and glory the operation of the Spirit is the building of the Son
of God; and the building of the Son of God is the co-operation of the
Holy Ghost. And so we read not only that the Holy Ghost came upon the
Virgin, but also that the power of the Most High overshadowed the
Virgin; that since Wisdom Itself is the fulness of the Godhead, no one
might doubt that when Wisdom built Itself a house all the fulness of the
Godhead was present. But the wretched hardness of your blasphemy, while
it tries to sever Christ from the Son of God, fails to see that it is
entirely severing the nature of the Godhead from Itself. Unless perhaps
you believe that the house is therefore built for Him by the Holy Ghost
because He Himself was insufficient and incapable of building for
Himself an house. But it is as absurd as it is wild, to believe that He,
whom we believe to have created the whole universe of things heavenly
and earthly by His will, was unable to build for Himself a body:
especially as the power of the Holy Ghost is His power, and the Divinity
and Glory of the Trinity are so united and inseparable, that we cannot
think of anything at all in One Person of the Trinity, which can be
separated from the fulness of the Godhead. Therefore when this is laid
down and grasped; viz., that according to the faith of holy Scripture,
when the Holy Ghost came upon (the Virgin) and the power of the Most
High overshadowed her, Wisdom builded Itself an house; the rest of the
slanders of your blasphemy come to nothing. For neither is it doubtful
that He made all things by Himself and in Himself, in whose name and
faith, the faith even of believers can do anything. For neither did He
need the aid of another, as neither have they needed it, who have
trusted in His power. And so as for your assertions that He was
justified by the Spirit, and that the Spirit made Him to be feared by
the devils, and that His flesh became the temple of the Holy Ghost, and
that He was taken up by the Spirit into heaven, they are all blasphemous
and wild: not because we are to believe that in all these things which
He Himself did, the unity and cooperation of the Spirit was
wanting—since the Godhead is never wanting to Itself, and the power of
the Trinity was ever present in the Saviour’s works—but because you will
have it that the Holy Ghost gave assistance to the Lord Jesus Christ as
if He had been feeble and powerless; and that He granted those <span
id="page_614">p. 614</span> <span
id="iv.vii.viii.xvii-Page_614"></span>things to Him, which He was unable
to procure for Himself. Learn then from sacred witnesses to believe God,
and not to mingle falsehood with truth: for the subject does not admit
it, and common sense abhors the idea of mingling the notions of the
spirit of the devil with the witnesses that are Divine.
