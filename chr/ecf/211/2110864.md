#### <span id="iv.v.v.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.

<span id="iv.v.v.iv-p1"></span>How practical life is distributed among
many different professions and interests.

<span id="iv.v.v.iv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.v.iv-p2.1"></span>This</span> practical life then, which as has
been said rests on a double system, is distributed among many different
professions and interests. For some make it their whole purpose to aim
at the secrecy of an anchorite and purity of heart, as we know that in
the past Elijah and Elisha, and in our own day the blessed Antony and
others who followed with the same object, were joined most closely to
God by the silence of solitude. Some have given all their efforts and
interests towards the system of the brethren and the watchful care of
the Cœnobium; as we remember that recently Abbot John, who presided over
a big monastery in the neighbourhood of the city Thmuis, <span
id="fr_1867"></span>[1868](#fn_1867) and some other men of like merits
were eminent with the signs of Apostles. Some are pleased with the
kindly service of the guest house and reception, by which in the past
the patriarch Abraham and Lot pleased the Lord, and recently the blessed
Macarius, <span id="fr_1868"></span>[1869](#fn_1868) a man of singular
courtesy and patience who presided over the guest house at Alexandria in
such a way as to be considered inferior to none of those who aimed at
the retirement of the desert. Some choose the care of the sick, others
devote themselves to intercession, which is offered up for the oppressed
and afflicted, or give themselves up to teaching, or give alms to the
poor, and flourish among men of excellence and renown, by reason of
their love and goodness.

<span id="iv.v.v.iv-p3"></span> It is doubtful whether this is the same
John mentioned in the Institutes V. xxviii. and to whom the xixth
Conference is assigned. Thmuis is the coptic Thmoui, a little to the
south of the Mendesian branch of the Nile. See Rawlinson’s note to
Herod. ii. c. 166 and cf. Ptolemy IV. v. § 51.
