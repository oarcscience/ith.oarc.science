#### <span id="iv.iv.iv.xvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVII.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xvii-p1"></span>That temperateness and the endurance
of temptations must be given to us by the Lord.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xvii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.iv.xvii-p2.1"></span>And</span> that all the endurance, with
which we can bear the temptations brought upon us, depends not so much
on our own strength as on the mercy and guidance of God, the blessed
Apostle thus declares: “No temptation hath come upon you but such as is
common to man. But God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be
tempted above that ye are able, but will with the temptation make also a
way of escape, that ye may be able to bear it.” <span
id="fr_1273"></span>[1274](#fn_1273.md) And that God fits and strengthens
our souls for every good work, and worketh in us all those things which
are pleasing to Him, the same Apostle teaches: “May the God of peace who
brought out of darkness the great Shepherd of the sheep, Jesus Christ,
in the blood of the everlasting Testament, fit you in all goodness,
working in you what is well-pleasing in His sight.” <span
id="fr_1274"></span>[1275](#fn_1274.md) And that the same thing may happen
to the Thessalonians he prays as follows, saying: “Now our Lord Jesus
Christ Himself and God our Father who hath loved us and hath given us
everlasting consolation and good hope in grace, exhort your hearts, and
confirm you in every good word and work.” <span
