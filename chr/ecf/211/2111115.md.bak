you that all this time I am chiefly using the witness of the Apostle
Paul alone. He is good enough for me, whom God chose, nor do I blush to
call as the witness to my faith, the man whom God willed to be the
teacher of the whole world. But to yield to your wishes, as perhaps you
fancy that I have no other proofs to use, hear the perfect mystery of
man’s salvation and eternal bliss, which Martha proclaims in the gospel.
For what does she say? “Of a truth, Lord, I have believed that Thou art
the Christ, the Son of the living God, who art come into this
world.” <span id="fr_2439"></span>[2440](#fn_2439.md) Learn the true faith
from a woman. Learn the confession of eternal hope. Yet you have a
splendid consolation: you need not blush to be taught the mystery of
salvation by her, whose testimony God did not refuse to accept.
