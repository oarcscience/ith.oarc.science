#### <span id="iv.v.vi.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.

<span id="iv.v.vi.v-p1"></span>Of the cure of a lame man which the same
saint wrought.

<span id="iv.v.vi.v-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.vi.v-p2.1"></span>Or</span> when the same man as he went to a
village was surrounded by mocking crowds, who sneered at him and showed
him a man who was for many years deprived of the power of walking from a
contracted knee, and crawled from a weakness of long standing, they
tempted him and said, “Show us, father Abraham, if you are the servant
of God, and restore this man to his former health, that we may believe
that the name of Christ, whom you worship, is not vain.” Then he at once
invoked the name of Christ, and stooped down and laid hold of the man’s
withered foot and pulled it. And immediately at his touch the dried and
bent knee was straightened, and he got back the use of his legs, which
he had forgotten how to use in his long years of weakness, and went away
rejoicing.
