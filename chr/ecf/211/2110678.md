#### <span id="iv.iv.vi.xv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XV.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.xv-p1"></span>How we can do nothing against our
faults without the help of God, and how we should not be puffed up by
victories over them.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.xv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.vi.xv-p2.1"></span>And</span> that we ought not to be puffed
up by victories over them he likewise charges us; saying, “Lest after
thou hast eaten and art filled, hast built goodly houses and dwelt in
them, and shalt have herds of oxen and flocks of sheep, and plenty of
gold and of silver, and of all things, thy heart be lifted up and thou
remember not the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land of
Egypt, out of the house of bondage; and was thy leader in the great and
terrible wilderness.” <span id="fr_1339"></span>[1340](#fn_1339) Solomon
also says in Proverbs: “When thine enemy shall fall be not glad, and in
his ruin be not lifted up, lest the Lord see and it displease Him, and
He turn away His wrath from him,” <span
id="fr_1340"></span>[1341](#fn_1340) i.e., lest He see thy pride of
heart, and cease from attacking him, and thou begin to be forsaken by
Him and so once more to be troubled by that passion which by God’s grace
thou hadst previously overcome. For the prophet would not have prayed in
these words, “Deliver not up to beasts, O Lord, the soul that confesseth
to Thee,” <span id="fr_1341"></span>[1342](#fn_1341) unless he had known
that because of their pride of heart some were given over again to those
faults which they had overcome, in order that they might be humbled.
Wherefore it is well for us both to be certified by actual experience,
and also to be instructed by countless passages of Scripture, that we
cannot possibly overcome such mighty foes in our own strength, and
unless supported by the aid of God alone; and that we ought always to
refer the whole of our victory each day to God Himself, as the Lord
Himself also gives us instruction by Moses on this very point: “Say not
in thine heart when the Lord thy God shall have destroyed them in thy
sight: For my <span id="page_347">p. 347</span> <span
id="iv.iv.vi.xv-Page_347"></span>righteousness hath the Lord brought me
in to possess this land, whereas these nations are destroyed for their
wickedness. For it is not for thy righteousness, and the uprightness of
thine heart, that thou shalt go in to possess their lands: but because
they have done wickedly they are destroyed at thy coming in.” <span
id="fr_1342"></span>[1343](#fn_1342) I ask what could be said clearer in
opposition to that impious notion and impertinence of ours, in which we
want to ascribe everything that we do to our own free will and our own
exertions? “Say not,” he tells us, “in thine heart, when the Lord thy
God shall have destroyed them in thy sight: For my righteousness the
Lord hath brought me in to possess this land.” To those who have their
eyes opened and their ears ready to hearken does not this plainly say:
When your struggle with carnal faults has gone well for you, and you see
that you are free from the filth of them, and from the fashions of this
world, do not be puffed up by the success of the conflict and victory
and ascribe it to your own power and wisdom, nor fancy that you have
gained the victory over spiritual wickedness and carnal sins through
your own exertions and energy, and free will? For there is no doubt that
in all this you could not possibly have succeeded, unless you had been
fortified and protected by the help of the Lord.
