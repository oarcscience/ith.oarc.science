#### <span id="iv.iii.ii.xviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.

<span id="iv.iii.ii.xviii-p1"></span>How they do not kneel from the
evening of Saturday till the evening of Sunday.

<span id="iv.iii.ii.xviii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.ii.xviii-p2.1"></span>This</span>, too, we ought to
know,—that from the evening of Saturday which precedes the Sunday, <span
id="fr_711"></span>[712](#fn_711.md) up to the following evening, among the
Egyptians they never kneel, nor from Easter to Whitsuntide; <span
id="fr_712"></span>[713](#fn_712.md) nor do they at these times observe a
rule of fasting, <span id="fr_713"></span>[714](#fn_713.md) the reason for
which shall be explained in its proper place in the Conferences of the
Elders, <span id="fr_714"></span>[715](#fn_714.md) if the Lord permits. At
present we only propose to run through the causes very briefly, lest our
book exceed its due limits and prove tiresome or burdensome to the
reader.

<span id="iv.iii.ii.xviii-p3"></span> *Quœ lucescit inm die dominicum*.
The phrase is borrowed by Cassian from the Latin of S. [Matt. xxviii.

<span id="iv.iii.ii.xviii-p5"></span> That this was the rule of the
primitive Church is shown by Tertullian, *De Corona Militis*, c. iii.
“We count fasting or kneeling in worship on the Lord’s day to be
unlawful. We rejoice in the same privilege, also, from Easter to
Whitsunday.” And even earlier, in a fragment of Irenæus, there is a
mention of the fact that Christians abstained from kneeling on Sunday in
token of the resurrection. For later testimonies see Ambrose, *Ep*. 119,
*ad Januarium*. Epiphanius, *on Heresies*, Book III. (Vol. III. p. 583,
ed. Dindorf). Jerome, *Dial: Adv. Lucif*. c. iv., and the Twentieth
Canon of the Council of Nicæa, with Canon Bright’s notes (*Notes on the
Canons of the First Four General Councils*, p. 72).
