#### <span id="iv.iii.xii.xxx-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXX.

<span id="iv.iii.xii.xxx-p1"></span>How when a man has grown cold
through pride he wants to be put to rule other people.

<span id="iv.iii.xii.xxx-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.xii.xxx-p2.1"></span>And</span> when a man whom pride has
mastered has fallen through these stages of descent, he shudders at the
discipline of the cœnobium, and—as if the companionship of the brethren
hindered his perfection, and the sins of others impeded and interfered
with his advance in patience and humility—he longs to take up is abode
in a solitary cell; else is eager to build a monastery and gather
together some others to teach and instruct, as if he would do good to
many more people, and make himself from being a bad disciple a still
worse master. For when through this pride of heart a man has fallen into
this most dangerous and injurious coldness, he can neither be a real
monk nor a man of the world, and what is worse, promises to himself to
gain perfection by means of this wretched state and manner of life of
his.
