#### <span id="iv.iv.x.xxix-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXIX.

<span id="iv.iv.x.xxix-p1"></span>The answer on the varieties of
conviction which spring from tears.

<span id="iv.iv.x.xxix-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.x.xxix-p2.1"></span>Isaac</span>: Not every kind of shedding
of tears is produced by one feeling or one virtue. For in one way does
that weeping originate which is caused by the pricks of our sins smiting
our heart, of which we read: “I have laboured in my groanings, every
night I will wash my bed; I will water my couch with my tears.” <span
id="fr_1619"></span>[1620](#fn_1619.md) And again: “Let tears run down like
a torrent day and night: give thyself no rest, and let not the apple of
thine eye cease.” <span id="fr_1620"></span>[1621](#fn_1620.md) In another,
that which arises from the contemplation of eternal good things and the
desire of that future glory, owing to which even richer well-springs of
tears burst forth from uncontrollable delights and boundless exultation,
while our soul is athirst for the mighty Living God, saying, “When shall
I come and appear before the presence of God? My tears have been my meat
day and night,” <span id="fr_1621"></span>[1622](#fn_1621.md) declaring
with daily crying and lamentation: “Woe is me that my sojourning is
prolonged;” and: “Too long hath my soul been a sojourner.” <span
id="fr_1622"></span>[1623](#fn_1622.md) In another way do the tears flow
forth, which without any conscience of deadly sin, yet still proceed
from the fear of hell and the recollection of that terrible judgment,
with the terror of which the prophet was smitten and prayed to God,
saying: “Enter not into judgment with Thy servant, for in Thy sight
shall no man living be justified.” <span
id="fr_1623"></span>[1624](#fn_1623.md) There is too another kind of tears,
which are caused not by knowledge of one’s self but by the hardness and
sins of others; whereby Samuel is described as having wept for Saul, and
both the Lord in the gospel and Jeremiah in former days for the city of
Jerusalem, the latter thus saying: “Oh, that my head were water and mine
eyes a fountain of tears! And I will weep day and night for the slain of
the daughter of my people.” <span id="fr_1624"></span>[1625](#fn_1624.md)
Or also such as were those tears of which we hear in the hundred and
first Psalm: “For I have eaten ashes for my bread, and mingled my cup
with weeping.” <span id="fr_1625"></span>[1626](#fn_1625.md) And these were
certainty not caused by the same feeling as those which arise in the
sixth Psalm from the person of the penitent, but were due to the
anxieties of this life and its distresses and losses, by which the
righteous who are living in this world are oppressed. And this is
clearly shown not only by the words of the Psalm itself, but also by its
title, which runs as follows in the character of that poor person of
whom it is said in the gospel that “blessed are the poor in spirit, for
theirs is the kingdom of heaven:” <span
id="fr_1626"></span>[1627](#fn_1626.md) “A prayer of the poor when he was
in distress and poured forth his prayer to God.” <span
id="fr_1627"></span>[1628](#fn_1627.md)
