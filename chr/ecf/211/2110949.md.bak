#### <span id="iv.v.viii.xxix-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXIX.

<span id="iv.v.viii.xxix-p1"></span>How we ought to do those things
which are to be kept secret.

<span id="iv.v.viii.xxix-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.viii.xxix-p2.1"></span>You</span> must also provide with the
same care that if by chance some word has slipped out of your mouth
which you want to be a secret, no injunction to secrecy may trouble the
hearer. For it will be more likely to be unheeded if it is let pass
carelessly and simply, because the brother, whoever he is, will not be
tormented with such a temptation to divulge it, as he will take it as
something trivial dropped in casual conversation, and as what is for
this very reason of less account, because it was not committed to the
hearer’s mind with a strict injunction to silence. For even if you bind
his faith by exacting an oath from him, you need not doubt that it will
very soon be divulged; for a fiercer assault of the devil’s power will
be made upon him, both to annoy and betray you, and to make him break
his oath as quickly as possible.
