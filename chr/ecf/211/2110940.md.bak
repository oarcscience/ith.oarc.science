#### <span id="iv.v.viii.xx-p0.1"></span>Chapter XX.

<span id="iv.v.viii.xx-p1"></span>How even Apostles thought that a lie
was often useful and the truth injurious.

<span id="iv.v.viii.xx-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.viii.xx-p2.1"></span>Instructed</span> by which examples, the
blessed Apostle James also, and all the chief princes of the primitive
Church urged the Apostle Paul in consequence of the weakness of feeble
persons to condescend to a fictitious arrangement and insisted on his
purifying himself according to the requirements of the law, and shaving
his head and paying his vows, as they thought that the present harm
which would come from this hypocrisy was of no account, but had regard
rather to the gain which would result from his still continued
preaching. For the gain to the Apostle Paul from his strictness would
not have counterbalanced the loss to all nations from his speedy death.
And this would certainly have been then incurred by the whole Church
unless this good and salutary hypocrisy had preserved him for the
preaching of the Gospel. For then we may rightly and pardonably
acquiesce in the wrong of a lie, when, as we said, a greater harm
depends on telling the truth, and when the good which results to us from
speaking the truth cannot counterbalance the harm which will be caused
by it. And elsewhere the blessed Apostle testifies in other words that
he himself always observed this disposition; for when he says: “To the
Jews I became as a Jew that I might gain the Jews; to those who were
under the law as being under the law, though not myself under the law,
that I might gain those who were under the law; to those who were
without law, I became as without law, though I was not without the law
of God but under the law of Christ, that I might gain those who were
without law; to the weak I became weak, that I might gain the weak: I
became all things to all men, that I might save all;” <span
id="fr_2031"></span>[2032](#fn_2031.md) what does he show but that
according to the weakness and the capacity of those who were being
instructed he always lowered himself and relaxed something of the vigour
of perfection, and did not cling to what his own strict life might seem
to demand, but rather preferred that which the good of the weak might
require? And that we may trace these matters out more carefully and
recount one by one the glories of the good deeds of the Apostles, some
one may ask how the blessed Apostle can be proved to have suited himself
to all men in all things. When did he to the Jews become as a Jew?
Certainly in the case where, while he still kept in his inmost heart the
opinion which he had maintained to the Galatians saying: “Behold, I,
Paul, say unto you that if ye be circumcised Christ shall profit you
nothing,” <span id="fr_2032"></span>[2033](#fn_2032.md) yet by circumcising
Timothy he adopted a shadow as it were of Jewish superstition. And
again, where did he become to those under the law, as under the law?
There certainly where James and all the Elders of the Church, fearing
lest he might be attacked by the multitude of Jewish believers, or
rather of Judaizing Christians, who had received the faith of Christ in
such a way as still to be bound by the rites of legal ceremonies, came
to his rescue in his difficulty with this counsel and advice, and said:
“Thou seest, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews, who
have believed, and they are all zealots for the law. But they have heard
of thee that thou teachest those Jews who are among the Gentiles to
depart from Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise their
children;” and below: “Do therefore this that we say unto thee: we have
four men who have a vow on them. These take and sanctify thyself with
them and bestow on them, that they may shave their heads; and all will
know that the things which they have heard of thee are false, but that
thou thyself also walkest keeping the law.” <span
id="fr_2033"></span>[2034](#fn_2033.md) And so for the good of those who
were under the law, he trode under foot for a while the strict view
which he had expressed: “For I through the law am dead unto the law that
I may live unto God;” <span id="fr_2034"></span>[2035](#fn_2034.md) and was
driven to shave his head, and be purified according to the law and pay
his vows after the Mosaic rites in the Temple. Do you ask also where for
the good of those who were utterly ignorant of the law of God, he
himself became as if without law? Read <span id="page_468">p. 468</span>
<span id="iv.v.viii.xx-Page_468"></span>the introduction to his sermon
at Athens where heathen wickedness was flourishing: “As I passed by,” he
says, “I saw your idols and an altar on which was written: To the
unknown God;” and when he had thus started from their superstition, as
if he himself also had been without law, under the cloke of that profane
inscription he introduced the faith of Christ, saying: “What therefore
ye ignorantly worship, that declare I unto you.” And after a little, as
if he had known nothing whatever of the Divine law, he chose to bring
forward a verse of a heathen poet rather than a saying of Moses or
Christ, saying: “As some also of your own poets have said: for we are
also His offspring.” And when he had thus approached them with their own
authorities, which they could not reject, thus confirming the truth by
things false, he added and said: “Since then we are the offspring of God
we ought not to think that the Godhead is like to gold or silver or
stone sculptured by the art and device of man.” <span
id="fr_2035"></span>[2036](#fn_2035.md) But to the weak he became weak,
when, by way of permission, not of command, he allowed those who could
not contain themselves to return together again, <span
id="fr_2036"></span>[2037](#fn_2036.md) or when he fed the Corinthians with
milk and not with meat, and says that he was with them in weakness and
fear and much trembling. <span id="fr_2037"></span>[2038](#fn_2037.md) But
he became all things to all men that he might save all, when he says:
“He that eateth let him not despise him that eateth not, and let not him
that eateth not judge him that eateth:” and: “He that giveth his virgin
in marriage doeth well, and he that giveth her not in marriage doeth
better;” and elsewhere: “Who,” says he, “is weak, and I am not weak? Who
is offended, and I burn not?” and in this way he fulfilled what he had
commanded the Corinthians to do when he said: “Be ye without offence to
Jews and Greeks and the Church of Christ, as I also please all men in
all things, not seeking mine own profit but that of the many, that they
may be saved.” <span id="fr_2038"></span>[2039](#fn_2038.md) For it had
certainly been profitable not to circumcise Timothy, not to shave his
head, not to undergo Jewish purification, not to practice going
barefoot, <span id="fr_2039"></span>[2040](#fn_2039.md) not to pay legal
vows; but he did all these things because he did not seek his own profit
but that of the many. And although this was done with the full
consideration of God, yet it was not free from dissimulation. For one
who through the law of Christ was dead to the law that he might live to
God, and who had made and treated that righteousness of the law in which
he had lived blameless, as dung, that he might gain Christ, could not
with true fervour of heart offer what belonged to the law; nor is it
right to believe that he who had said: “For if I again rebuild what I
have destroyed, I make myself a transgressor,” <span
id="fr_2040"></span>[2041](#fn_2040.md) would himself fall into what he had
condemned. And to such an extent is account taken, not so much of the
actual thing which is done as of the disposition of the doer, that on
the other hand truth is sometimes found to have injured some, and a lie
to have done them good. For when Saul was grumbling to his servants
about David’s flight, and saying: “Will the son of Jesse give you all
fields and vineyards, and make you all tribunes and centurions: that all
of you have conspired against me, and there is no one to inform me,” did
Doeg the Edomite say anything but the truth, when he told him: “I saw
the son of Jesse in Nob, with Abimelech the son of Ahitub the priest,
who consulted the Lord for him, and gave him victuals, and gave him also
the sword of Goliath the Philistine?” <span
id="fr_2041"></span>[2042](#fn_2041.md) For which true story he deserved to
be rooted up out of the land of the living, and it is said of him by the
prophet: “Wherefore God shall destroy thee forever, and pluck thee up
and tear thee out of thy tabernacle, and thy root from the land of the
living:” <span id="fr_2042"></span>[2043](#fn_2042.md) He then for showing
the truth is forever plucked and rooted up out of that land in which the
harlot Rahab with her family is planted for her lie: just as also we
remember that Samson most injuriously betrayed to his wicked wife the
truth which he had hidden for a long time by a lie, and therefore the
truth so inconsiderately disclosed was the cause of his own deception,
because he had neglected to keep the command of the prophet: “Keep the
doors of thy mouth from her that sleepeth in thy bosom.” <span
