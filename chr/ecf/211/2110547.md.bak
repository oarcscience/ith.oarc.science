#### <span id="iv.iii.xii.xvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVI.

<span id="iv.iii.xii.xvi-p1"></span>That we cannot even make the effort
to obtain perfection without the mercy and inspiration of God.

<span id="iv.iii.xii.xvi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.xii.xvi-p2.1"></span>We</span> ought therefore, in accordance
with their teaching and instruction, so to press towards it, and to be
diligent in fastings, vigils, prayers, and contrition of heart and body,
for fear lest all these things should be rendered useless by an attack
of this malady. For we ought to believe not merely that we cannot secure
this actual perfection by our own efforts and exertions, but also that
we cannot perform those things which we practise for its sake, viz., our
efforts and exertions and desires, without the assistance of the divine
protection, and the grace of His inspiration, chastisement, and
exhortation, which He ordinarily sheds abroad in our hearts either
through the instrumentality of another, or in His own person coming to
visit us.

do anything which belongs to our salvation without the aid of
God.](2110548.md)
