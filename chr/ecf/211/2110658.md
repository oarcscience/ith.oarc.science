#### <span id="iv.iv.v.xvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVII.

<span id="iv.iv.v.xvii-p1"></span>Of the lukewarmness of eunuchs.

<span id="iv.iv.v.xvii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.v.xvii-p2.1"></span>Lastly</span>, on this account in those
who are Eunuchs, we often detect the existence of this lukewarmness of
mind, because, as they are so to speak free from the needs of the flesh,
they fancy that they have no need either of the trouble of bodily
abstinence, or of contrition of heart; and being rendered slack by this
freedom from anxiety, they make no efforts either truly to seek or to
acquire perfection of heart or even purity from spiritual faults. And
this condition which is the result of their state in the flesh, becomes
natural, which is altogether a worse state. For he who passes from the
state of coldness to that of lukewarmness is branded by the Lord’s words
as still more hateful.
