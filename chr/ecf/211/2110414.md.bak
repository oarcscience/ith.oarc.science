#### <span id="iv.iii.v.xli-p0.1"></span>Chapter XLI.

<span id="iv.iii.v.xli-p1"></span>The saying of Abbot Macarius of the
behaviour of a monk as one who was to live for a long while, and as one
who was daily at the point of death.

<span id="iv.iii.v.xli-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.v.xli-p2.1"></span>There</span> is still one valuable charge
of the blessed Macarius to be brought forward by us, so that a saying of
so great a man may close this book of fasts and abstinence. He said then
that a monk ought to bestow attention on his fasts, just as if he were
going to remain in the flesh for a hundred years; and to curb the
motions of the soul, and to forget injuries, and to loathe sadness, and
despise sorrows and losses, as if he were daily at the point of death.
For in the former case discretion is useful and proper as it causes a
monk always to walk with well-balanced care, and does not suffer him by
reason of a weakened body to fall from the heights over most dangerous
precipices: in the other high-mindedness is most valuable as it will
enable him not only to despise the seeming prosperity of this present
world, but also not to be crushed by adversity and sorrow, and to
despise them as small and paltry matters, since he has the gaze of his
mind continually fixed there, whither daily at each moment he believes
that he is soon to be summoned. <span id="fr_875"></span>[876](#fn_875.md)

<span id="iv.iii.v.xli-p3"></span> Socrates (H.E. Book IV. c. xxiii.)
gives an account of two monks of the name of Macarius, one of whom was
from Upper Egypt, and the other from Alexandria. Compare also Rufinus
History of the Monks, cc. xxviii., xxix. It is not certain to which of
them Cassian’s stories refer, here and in the Conferences V. xii. VII.
xxvii., XXIV. xiii. The story told in Conference XV. iii, refers to the
“Egyptian” Macarius (cf. Sozomen H. E. III. xiv., where the miracle is
expressly assigned to him): that in XIV. iv. evidently belongs to the
“Alexandrian” Macarius. The two are mentioned together in Conference
XIX. ix., and by various other writers.
