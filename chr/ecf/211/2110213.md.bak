<span id="ii.vi.ii.xxiv-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.vi.ii.xxiv-p1.1"></span>While</span> these things are going on in
Judæa, a certain young man educated at Rhodes, by name Alexander, gave
himself out as being the son of Antiochus (which was false), and
assisted by the power of Ptolemy, king of Alexandria, came into Syria
with an army. He conquered Demetrius in war, and slew him after he had
reigned twelve years. This Alexander before he made war against
Demetrius, had formed an alliance with Jonathan, and had presented him
with a purple robe and royal ensigns. For this reason Jonathan had
assisted him with auxiliary forces; and on the defeat of Demetrius, had
been the very first to meet him with congratulations. Nor did Alexander
afterwards violate the faith which he had pledged. Accordingly, in the
five years during which he held the chief power, the affairs of the Jews
were peaceful. In these circumstances, Demetrius, the son of Demetrius,
who, after the death of his father, had betaken himself to Crete, at the
instigation of Lasthenes, general of the Cretans, tried by war to
recover the kingdom of his, father, but finding his power unequal to the
task, he implored Ptolemy Philometor, king of Egypt, the father-in-law
of Alexander, but who was then on bad terms with his son-in-law, to give
him assistance. But he, induced not so much by the entreaties of the
suppliant as by the hope of seizing Syria, joined his forces with those
of Demetrius, and gives him his daughter, who had been married to
Alexander. Against these two Alexander fought a pitched battle. Ptolemy
fell in the fight, but Alexander was defeated; and he was soon
afterwards slain, after he had reigned five, or as I find it stated in
many authors, nine years.
