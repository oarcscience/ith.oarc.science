#### <span id="iv.iii.vii.xxi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXI.

<span id="iv.iii.vii.xxi-p1"></span>How covetousness can be conquered.

<span id="iv.iii.vii.xxi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.vii.xxi-p2.1"></span>And</span> in this case it will be the
greatest victory and a lasting triumph, if, as is said, the conscience
of the monk is not defiled by the possession of the smallest coin. For
it is an impossibility for him who, overcome in the matter of a small
possession, has once admitted into his heart a root of evil desire, not
to be inflamed presently with the heat of a still greater desire. For
the soldier of Christ will be victorious and in safety, and free from
all the attacks of desire, so long as this most evil spirit does not
implant in his heart a seed of this desire. Wherefore, though in the
matter of all kinds of sins we ought ordinarily to watch the serpent’s
head, <span id="fr_900"></span>[901](#fn_900.md) yet in this above all we
should be more keenly on our guard. For if it has been admitted it will
grow by feeding on itself, and will kindle for itself a worse fire. And
so we must not only guard against the *possession* of money, but also
must expel from our souls the *desire* for it. For we should not so much
avoid the results of covetousness, as cut off by the roots all
disposition towards it. For it will do no good not to possess money, if
there exists in us the desire for getting it.
