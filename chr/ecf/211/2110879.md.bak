#### <span id="iv.v.v.xix-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIX.

<span id="iv.v.v.xix-p1"></span>How often even those who are not worthy
can receive the grace of the saving word.

<span id="iv.v.v.xix-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.v.xix-p2.1"></span>But</span> sometimes in the lavish
generosity of God in His Providence, “Who willeth all men to be saved
and to come to the knowledge of the truth,” <span
id="fr_1936"></span>[1937](#fn_1936.md) it is granted that one who has not
shown himself by an irreproachable life to be worthy of the preaching of
the gospel attains the grace of spiritual teaching for the good of many.
But by what means the gifts of healing are granted by the Lord for the
expulsion of devils it follows that we must in a similar discussion
explain, which as we are going to rise for supper we will keep for the
evening, because that is always more effectually grasped by the heart
which is taken in by degrees and without excessive bodily efforts.
