#### <span id="iv.iii.v.xxxvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXVII.

<span id="iv.iii.v.xxxvii-p1"></span>Of the cells which Abbot Archebius
gave up to us with their furniture.

<span id="iv.iii.v.xxxvii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.v.xxxvii-p2.1"></span>Having</span> then seen this, as we
were inflamed with the desire of imitating them, the aforesaid
Archebius, the most famous among them for the grace of kindness, drew us
into his cell, and having discovered our desire, pretended that he
wanted to leave the place, and to offer his cell to us, as if he were
going away, declaring that he would have done it, even if we had not
come. And we, inflamed with the desire of remaining there, and putting
unhesitating faith in the assertions of so great a man, willingly agreed
to this, and took over his cell with all its furniture and belongings.
And so having succeeded in his pious fraud, he left the place for a few
days in which to procure the means for constructing a cell, and after
this returned, and with the utmost labour built another cell for
himself. And after some little time, when some other brethren came
inflamed with the same desire to stay there, he deceived them by a
similar charitable falsehood, and gave this one up with everything
pertaining to it. But he, unweariedly persevering in his act of charity,
built for himself a third cell to dwell in. <span
