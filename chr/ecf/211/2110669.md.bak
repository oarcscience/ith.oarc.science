<span id="iv.iv.vi.vi"></span>

#### <span id="iv.iv.vi.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.vi-p1"></span>Of the manner of the temptation in
which our Lord was attacked by the devil.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.vi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.vi.vi-p2.1"></span>For</span> it was right that He who was in
possession of the perfect image and likeness of God should be Himself
tempted through those passions, through which Adam also was tempted
while he still retained the image of God unbroken, that is, through
gluttony, vainglory, pride; and not through those in which he was by his
own fault entangled and involved after the transgression of the
commandment, when the image and likeness of God was marred. For it was
gluttony through which he took the fruit of the forbidden tree,
vainglory through which it was said “Your eyes shall be opened,” and
pride through which it was said “Ye shall be as gods, knowing good and
evil.” <span id="fr_1321"></span>[1322](#fn_1321.md) With these three sins
then we read that the Lord our Saviour was also tempted; with gluttony
when the devil said to Him: “Command these stones that they be made
bread:” with vainglory: “If Thou art the Son of God cast Thyself down:”
with pride, when he showed him all the kingdoms of the world and the
glory of them and said: “All this will I give to Thee if Thou wilt fall
down and worship me:” <span id="fr_1322"></span>[1323](#fn_1322.md) in
order that He might by His example teach us how we ought to vanquish the
tempter when we are attacked on the same lines of temptation as He was.
And so both the former and the latter are spoken of as Adam; the one
being the first for destruction and death, and the other the first for
resurrection and life. Through the one the whole race of mankind is
brought into condemnation, through the other the whole race of mankind
is set free. The one was fashioned out of raw and unformed earth, the
other was born of the Virgin Mary. In His case then though it was
fitting that He should undergo temptation, yet it was not necessary that
He should fail under it. Nor could He who had vanquished gluttony be
tempted by fornication, which springs from superfluity and gluttony as
its root, with which even the first Adam would not have been destroyed
unless before its birth he had been deceived by the wiles of the devil
and fallen a victim to passion. And therefore the Son of God is not said
absolutely to have come “in the flesh of sin,” but “in the likeness of
the flesh of sin,” because though His was true flesh and He ate and
drank and slept, and truly received the prints of the nails, there was
in Him no true sin inherited from the fall, but only what was something
like it. For He had no experience of the fiery darts of carnal lust,
which in our case arise even against our will, from the constitution of
our natures, but He took upon Him something like this, by sharing in our
nature. For as He truly fulfilled every function which belongs to us,
and bore all human infirmities, He has consequently been considered to
have been subject to this feeling also, that He might appear through
these infirmities to bear in His own flesh the state even of this fault
and sin. Lastly the devil only tempted Him to those sins, by which he
had deceived the first Adam, inferring that He as man would similarly be
deceived in other matters if he found that He was overcome by those
temptations by which he had overthrown His predecessor. But as he was
overthrown in the first encounter he was not able to bring upon Him the
second infirmity which had shot up as from the root of the first fault.
For he saw that He had not even admitted anything from which this
infirmity might take its rise, and it was idle to hope for the fruit of
sin from Him, as he saw that He in no sort of way received into Himself
seeds or roots of it. Yet according to Luke, who places last that
temptation in which he uses the words “If Thou art the Son of God, cast
Thyself down,” <span id="fr_1323"></span>[1324](#fn_1323.md) we can
understand this of the feeling of pride, so that that earlier one, which
Matthew places third, in which, as Luke the evangelist says, the devil
showed Him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time and
promised them to Him, may be taken of the feeling of covetousness,
because after His victory over gluttony, he did not venture to tempt Him
to fornication, but passed on to covetousness, which he knew to be the
root of all evils, <span id="fr_1324"></span>[1325](#fn_1324.md) and when
again vanquished in this, he did not dare attack Him with any of those
sins which follow, which, as he knew full well, spring from this as a
root and source; and so he passed on to the last passion; viz., pride,
by which he knew that those who are perfect and have overcome all other
sins, can be affected, and owing to which he remembered that he himself
in his character of Lucifer, and many others too, had fallen from their
heavenly estate, without temptation from any of the preceding passions.
In this order then which we have mentioned, which is the one given by
the evangelist Luke, <span id="page_342">p. 342</span> <span
id="iv.iv.vi.vi-Page_342"></span>there is an exact agreement between the
allurements and forms of the temptations by which that most crafty foe
attacked both the first and the second Adam. For to the one he said
“Your eyes shall be opened;” to the other “he showed all the kingdoms of
the world and the glory of them.” In the one case he said “Ye shall be
as gods;” in the other, “If Thou art the Son of God.” <span
