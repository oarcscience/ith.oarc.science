#### <span id="iv.iv.x.ii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.

<span id="iv.iv.x.ii-p1"></span>The words of Abbot Isaac on the nature
of prayer.

<span id="iv.iv.x.ii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.x.ii-p2.1"></span>The</span> aim of every monk and the
perfection of his heart tends to continual and unbroken perseverance in
prayer, and, as far as it is allowed to human frailty, strives to
acquire an immovable tranquillity of mind and a perpetual purity, for
the sake of which we seek unweariedly and constantly to practise all
bodily labours as well as contrition of spirit. And there is between
these two a sort of reciprocal and inseparable union. For just as the
crown of the building of all virtues is the perfection of prayer, so
unless everything has been united and compacted by this as its crown, it
cannot possibly continue strong and stable. For lasting and continual
calmness in prayer, of which we are speaking, cannot be secured or
consummated without them, so neither can those virtues which lay its
foundations be fully gained without persistence in it. And so we shall
not be able either to treat properly of the effect of prayer, or in a
rapid discourse to penetrate to its main end, which is acquired by
labouring at all virtues, unless first all those things which for its
sake must be either rejected or secured, are singly enumerated and
discussed, and, as the Parable in the gospel teaches, <span
id="fr_1583"></span>[1584](#fn_1583.md) whatever concerns the building of
that spiritual and most lofty tower, is reckoned up and carefully
considered beforehand. But yet these things when prepared will be of no
use nor allow the lofty height of perfection to be properly placed upon
them unless a clearance of all faults be first undertaken, and the
decayed and dead rubbish of the passions be dug up, and the strong
foundations of simplicity and humility be laid on the solid and (so to
speak) living soil of our breast, or rather on that rock of the
gospel, <span id="fr_1584"></span>[1585](#fn_1584.md) and by being built in
this way this tower of spiritual virtues will rise, and be able to stand
unmoved, and be raised to the utmost heights of heaven in full assurance
of its stability. For if it rests <span id="page_388">p. 388</span>
<span id="iv.iv.x.ii-Page_388"></span>on such foundations, then though
heavy storms of passions break over it, though mighty torrents of
persecutions beat against it like a battering ram, though a furious
tempest of spiritual foes dash against it and attack it, yet not only
will no ruin overtake it, but the onslaught will not injure it even in
the slightest degree.
