#### <span id="iv.vi.viii.xxiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXIII.

<span id="iv.vi.viii.xxiii-p1"></span>The answer with the explanation of
the saying.

<span id="iv.vi.viii.xxiii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.viii.xxiii-p2.1"></span>Abraham</span>: We can prove by the
easy teaching of our own experience that our Lord and Saviour’s saying
is perfectly true, if we approach the way of perfection properly and in
accordance with Christ’s will, and mortifying all our desires, and
cutting off injurious likings, not only allow nothing to remain with us
of this world’s goods (whereby our adversary would find at his pleasure
opportunities of destroying and damaging us) but actually recognize that
we are not our own masters, and truly make our own the Apostle’s words:
“I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.” <span
id="fr_2325"></span>[2326](#fn_2325.md) For what can be burdensome, or hard
to one who has embraced with his whole heart the yoke of Christ, who is
established in true humility and ever fixes his eye on the Lord’s
sufferings and rejoices in all the wrongs that are offered to him,
saying: “For which cause I please myself in my infirmities, in
reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ:
for when I am weak, then am I strong”? <span
id="fr_2326"></span>[2327](#fn_2326.md) By what loss of any common thing, I
ask, will he be injured, who boasts of perfect renunciation, and
voluntarily rejects for Christ’s sake all the pomp of this world, and
considers all and every of its desires as dung, so that he may gain
Christ, and by continual meditation on this command of the gospel,
scorns and gets rid of agitation at every loss: “For what shall it
profit a man if he gain the whole world, but lose his own soul? Or what
shall a man give in exchange for his soul?” <span
id="fr_2327"></span>[2328](#fn_2327.md) For the loss of what will he be
vexed, who recognizes that everything that can be taken away from others
is not their own, and proclaims with unconquered valour: “We brought
nothing into this world: it is certain that we cannot carry anything
out”? <span id="fr_2328"></span>[2329](#fn_2328.md) By the needs of what
want will his courage be overcome, who knows how to do without “scrip
for the way, money for the purse,” <span
id="fr_2329"></span>[2330](#fn_2329.md) and, like the Apostle, glories “in
many fasts, in hunger and thirst, in cold and nakedness”? <span
id="fr_2330"></span>[2331](#fn_2330.md) What effort, or what hard command
of an Elder can disturb the peace of his bosom, who has no will of his
own, and not only patiently but even gratefully accepts what is
commanded him, and after the example of our Saviour, seeks to do not his
own will, but the Father’s, as He says Himself to His Father:
“Nevertheless not as I will, but as Thou wilt”? <span
id="fr_2331"></span>[2332](#fn_2331.md) By what wrongs also, by what
persecution will he be frightened, nay, what punishment can fail to be
delightful to him, who always rejoices together with apostles in
stripes, and longs to be counted worthy to suffer shame for the name of
Christ?
