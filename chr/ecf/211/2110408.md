#### <span id="iv.iii.v.xxxv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXV.

<span id="iv.iii.v.xxxv-p1"></span>A rebuke of the same old man, when he
had come to my cell in the middle of the night.

<span id="iv.iii.v.xxxv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.v.xxxv-p2.1"></span>The</span> same Theodore came
unexpectedly to my cell in the dead of night, with paternal
inquisitiveness seeking what I—an unformed anchorite as I was—might be
doing by myself; and when he had found me there already, as I had
finished my vesper office, beginning to refresh my wearied body, and
lying down on a mat, he sighed from the bottom of his heart, and calling
me by name, said, “How many, O John, are at this hour communing with
God, and embracing Him, and detaining Him with them, while you are
deprived of so great light, enfeebled as you are with lazy sleep!”

<span id="iv.iii.v.xxxv-p3"></span>And since the virtues of the fathers
and the grace given to them have tempted us to turn aside to a story
like this, I think it well to record in this volume a noteworthy deed of
charity, which we experienced from the kindness of that most excellent
man Archebius, that the purity of continence grafted on to a work of
charity may more readily shine forth, being embellished with a pleasing
variety. <span id="page_246">p. 246</span> <span
id="iv.iii.v.xxxv-Page_246"></span>For the duty of fasting is then
rendered acceptable to God, when it is made perfect by the fruits of
charity.
