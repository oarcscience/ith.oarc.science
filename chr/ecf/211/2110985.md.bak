#### <span id="iv.vi.iii.xv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XV.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.xv-p1"></span>A question whether chastity ought to
be ascertained just as the other feelings.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.xv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.xv-p2.1"></span>Germanus</span>: As the cure for other
ailments, viz., anger, vexation, and impatience, has been shown to
consist in opposing to them their contraries, so also we should like to
learn what sort of treatment we ought to use against the spirit of
fornication: I mean, whether the fire of lust can be quenched by the
representation, as in those other cases, of greater inducements and
things to excite it: because not merely to increase the incentives to
lust within us, but even to touch them with a passing look of the mind,
we believe to be utterly fatal to chastity.
