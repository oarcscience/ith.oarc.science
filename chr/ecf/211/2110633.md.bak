<span id="iv.iv.iv.xv"></span>

#### <span id="iv.iv.iv.xv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XV.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xv-p1"></span>That the understanding, by means of
which we can recognize God’s commands, and the performance of a good
will are both gifts from the Lord.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.iv.xv-p2.1"></span>Further</span> the blessed David asks of
the Lord that he may gain that very understanding, by which he can
recognize God’s com<span id="page_327">p. 327</span> <span
id="iv.iv.iv.xv-Page_327"></span>mands which, he well knew, were written
in the book of the law, and he says “I am Thy servant: O give me
understanding that I may learn Thy commandments.” <span
id="fr_1256"></span>[1257](#fn_1256.md) Certainly he was in possession of
understanding, which had been granted to him by nature, and also had at
his fingers’ ends a knowledge of God’s commands which were preserved in
writing in the law: and still he prayed the Lord that he might learn
this more thoroughly as he knew that what came to him by nature would
never be sufficient for him, unless his understanding was enlightened by
the Lord by a daily illumination from Him, to understand the law
spiritually and to recognize His commands more clearly, as the “chosen
vessel” also declares very plainly this which we are insisting on. “For
it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do according to good
will.” <span id="fr_1257"></span>[1258](#fn_1257.md) What could well be
clearer than the assertion that both our good will and the completion of
our work are fully wrought in us by the Lord? And again “For it is
granted to you for Christ’s sake, not only to believe in Him but also to
suffer for Him.” <span id="fr_1258"></span>[1259](#fn_1258.md) Here also he
declares that the beginning of our conversion and faith, and the
endurance of suffering is a gift to us from the Lord. And David too, as
he knows this, similarly prays that the same thing may be granted to him
by God’s mercy. “Strengthen, O God, that which Thou hast wrought in
us:” <span id="fr_1259"></span>[1260](#fn_1259.md) showing that it is not
enough for the beginning of our salvation to be granted by the gift and
grace of God, unless it has been continued and ended by the same pity
and continual help from Him. For not free will but the Lord “looseth
them that are bound.” No strength of ours, but the Lord “raiseth them
that are fallen:” no diligence in reading, but “the Lord enlightens the
blind:” where the Greeks have <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iv.iv.xv-p6.2"></span>κύριος σοφοῖ τυφλούς</span>, i.e., “the
Lord maketh wise the blind:” no care on our part, but “the Lord careth
for the stranger:” no courage of ours, but “the Lord assists (or
supports) all those who are down.” <span
id="fr_1260"></span>[1261](#fn_1260.md) But this we say, not to slight our
zeal and efforts and diligence, as if they were applied unnecessarily
and foolishly, but that we may know that we cannot strive without the
help of God, nor can our efforts be of any use in securing the great
reward of purity, unless it has been granted to us by the assistance and
mercy of the Lord: for “a horse is prepared for the day of battle: but
help cometh from the Lord,” <span id="fr_1261"></span>[1262](#fn_1261.md)
“for no man can prevail by strength.” <span
id="fr_1262"></span>[1263](#fn_1262.md) We ought then always to sing with
the blessed David: “My strength and my praise is” not my free will, but
“the Lord, and He is become my salvation.” <span
id="fr_1263"></span>[1264](#fn_1263.md) And the teacher of the Gentiles was
not ignorant of this when he declared that he was made capable of the
ministry of the New Testament not by his own merits or efforts but by
the mercy of God. “Not” says he, “that we are capable of thinking
anything of ourselves as of ourselves, but our sufficiency is of God,
which can be put in less good Latin but more forcibly, “our capability
is of God,” and then there follows: “Who also made us capable ministers
of the New Testament.” <span id="fr_1264"></span>[1265](#fn_1264.md)
