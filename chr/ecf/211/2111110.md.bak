#### <span id="iv.vii.iv.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.

<span id="iv.vii.iv.vi-p1"></span>He shows from the appearance of Christ
vouchsafed to the Apostle when persecuting the Church, the existence of
both natures in Him.

<span id="iv.vii.iv.vi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.iv.vi-p2.1"></span>Wherefore</span> also, when arguing before
King Agrippa and others of the world’s judges, he speaks as follows:
“When I was going to Damascus with authority and permission of the chief
priests, at midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven above
the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and all those that
were with me. And when we were all fallen down to the ground, I heard a
voice saying unto me in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest
thou Me? It is hard for thee to kick against the goad. And I said, Who
art Thou, Lord? And the Lord said to me: I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom
thou persecutest.” <span id="fr_2426"></span>[2427](#fn_2426.md) You see
how truly the Apostle said that he no longer knew according to the flesh
one whom he had seen in such splendour and majesty. For when as he lay
prostrate he saw the splendour of that divine light which he was unable
to endure, there followed this voice: “Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou
Me?” And when he asked who it might be, the Lord answers and clearly
points out His Personality: “I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou
persecutest.” Now then, you heretic, I ask you, I summon you. Do you
believe what the Apostle says of himself, or do you not believe it? Or
if you think that unimportant, do you believe what the Lord says of
Himself or do you not believe it? If you do believe it, there is an end
of the matter:  for you cannot help believing what we believe. For we,
like the Apostle, even if we have known Christ according to the flesh,
yet know Him so no longer. *We* do not heap insults on Christ. *We* do
not separate the flesh from the Divinity; and all that is in Christ *we*
believe is in God. If then you believe the same that we believe you must
acknowledge the same mysteries of the faith. But if you differ from us,
if you refuse to believe the Churches, the Apostle, aye and God’s own
testimony about Himself, show us in this vision which the Apostle saw,
how much is flesh, and how much God. For I cannot here separate one from
the other. I see the ineffable light, I see the inexpressible splendour,
I see the radiance that human weakness cannot endure, and beyond what
mortal eyes can bear, the glory of God shining with inconceivable
light. <span id="fr_2427"></span>[2428](#fn_2427.md) What room is there
here for division and separation? In the voice we hear Jesus, in the
majesty we see God. How can we help believing that in one and the same
(Personal) substance God and Jesus exist. But I should like to have a
few more words with you on this subject. Tell me, I pray you, if there
appeared to you in your present persecution of the Catholic faith that
same vision which then appeared to the Apostle in his ignorance, if when
you were not expecting it and were off your guard, that radiance shone
round about you, and the glory of that boundless light smote you in your
terror and confusion, and you lay prostrate in darkness of body and
soul; which the unlimited and indescribable terror of your heart
increased, <span id="fr_2428"></span>[2429](#fn_2428.md) —tell me, I
intreat you; When the dread of immediate death was pressing on you, and
the terror of the glory that threatened you from above, weighed you
down, and you <span id="page_566">p. 566</span> <span
id="iv.vii.iv.vi-Page_566"></span>heard as well in your bewilderment of
mind those words which your sin so well deserves: “Saul, Saul, why
persecutest thou Me?” and to your inquiry who it was the answer was
given from heaven: “I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest,” what
would you say? “I do not know, I do not yet fully believe. I want to
think over it with myself a little longer, who I think that Thou art,
who speakest from heaven, who overwhelmest me with the brightness of Thy
Divinity: whose voice I hear and whose splendour I cannot bear. I must
consider of this matter, whether I ought to believe Thee or not: whether
Thou art Christ or God. If Thou art God alone whether it is in Christ.
If Thou art Christ alone, whether it is in God. I want this distinction
to be carefully observed, and thoroughly considered what we should
believe that Thou art, and what we should judge Thee to be. For I don’t
want any of my offices to be wasted. As if I were to regard Thee as a
man, and yet pay to Thee some Divine honours.” If then you were lying on
the ground, as the Apostle Paul was then lying, and overwhelmed with the
brightness of the Divine light, were at your last gasp, perhaps you
would say this, and prate with all this silly chattering. But what shall
we make of the fact that another course commended itself to the Apostle;
and when he had fallen down, trembling and half dead, he did not think
that he ought any longer to conceal his belief, or to deliberate; it was
enough for him that he was taught by inexpressible arguments to know
that He whom he had ignorantly fancied to be a man, was God. He did not
conceal his belief, he made no delay. He did not any longer protract his
erroneous ideas by deliberating and disbelieving, but as soon as he
heard from heaven the name of Jesus his Lord, he replied in a voice,
subdued like that of a servant, tremulous like that of one scourged, and
full of fervour like that of one converted, “What shall I do, Lord?” And
so at once for his ready and earnest faith, it was granted to him that
he should never be without His presence whom he had faithfully believed:
and that He, to whom he had passed in heart, should Himself pass into
his heart: as the Apostle himself says of himself: “Do you seek a proof
of Christ that speaketh in me?” <span
