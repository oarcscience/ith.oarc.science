#### <span id="ii.vi.i.xxx-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXX.

<span id="ii.vi.i.xxx-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.vi.i.xxx-p1.1"></span>The</span> Hebrews, then, as I have
narrated above, were living according to their own will, without any
judge or general. Eli was priest; and in his days Samuel was born. His
father’s name was Elchana, and his mother’s, Anna. She having long been
barren, is said, when she asked a child from God, to have vowed that, if
it were a boy, it should be dedicated to God. Accordingly, having
brought forth a boy, she delivered him to Eli the priest. By and by,
when he had grown up, God spoke to him. He denounced wrath against Eli
the priest on account of the life of his sons, who had made the
priesthood of their father a means of gain to themselves, and exacted
gifts from those who came to sacrifice; and, although their father is
related to have often reproved them, yet his reproofs were too gentle to
serve the purpose of discipline. Well, the Philistines made an incursion
into Judæa, and were met by the Israelites. But the Hebrews, being
beaten, prepare to renew the contest: they carry the ark of the Lord
with them into battle, and the sons of the priests go forth with it,
because he himself, being burdened with years, and afflicted with
blindness, could not discharge that duty. But, when the ark was brought
within sight of the enemy, terrified as if by the majesty of God’s
presence, they were ready to take to flight. But again recovering
courage, and changing their minds (not without a divine impulse), they
rush into battle with their whole strength. The Hebrews were conquered;
the ark was taken; the sons of the priest fell. Eli, when the news of
the calamity was brought to him, being overwhelmed with grief, breathed
his last, after he had held the priesthood for twenty <span
