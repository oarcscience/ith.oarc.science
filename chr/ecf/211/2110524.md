#### <span id="iv.iii.xi.xiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIII.

<span id="iv.iii.xi.xiii-p1"></span>Of the ways in which vainglory
attacks a monk.

<span id="iv.iii.xi.xiii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.xi.xiii-p2.1"></span>In</span> the case also of beginners and
of those who have as yet made but little progress either in powers of
mind or in knowledge it usually puffs up their minds, either because of
the quality of their voice because they can sing well, or because their
bodies are emaciated, <span id="fr_1014"></span>[1015](#fn_1014.md) or
because they are of a good figure, or because they have rich and noble
kinsfolk, or because they have despised a military life and honours.
Sometimes too it persuades a man that if he had remained in the world he
would easily have obtained honours and riches, which perhaps could not
possibly have been secured, and inflates him with a vain hope of
uncertain things; and in the case of those things which he never
possessed, puffs him up with pride and vanity, as if he were one who had
despised them.
