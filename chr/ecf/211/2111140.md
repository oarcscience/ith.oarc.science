<span id="iv.vii.vi.v"></span>

#### <span id="iv.vii.vi.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.

<span id="iv.vii.vi.v-p1"></span>That before His birth in time Christ
was always called God by the prophets.

<span id="iv.vii.vi.v-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.vi.v-p2.1"></span>He</span> it is then of whom the Prophet
says: “For in Thee is God, and there is no God beside Thee. For Thou art
our God and we knew Thee not, O God of Israel the Saviour.” <span
id="fr_2502"></span>[2503](#fn_2502) Who “afterwards appeared on earth
and conversed with men.” <span id="fr_2503"></span>[2504](#fn_2503) Of
whom and in whose Person the Prophet David also speaks: “From my
mother’s womb Thou art my God:” <span
id="fr_2504"></span>[2505](#fn_2504) showing clearly that He who was
Lord and man <span id="fr_2505"></span>[2506](#fn_2505) was never
separate from God: in whom even in the Virgin’s womb the fulness of the
Godhead dwelt. As elsewhere the same Prophet says: “Truth has sprung
from the earth and righteousness hath looked down from heaven,” <span
id="fr_2506"></span>[2507](#fn_2506) that we may know that when the Son
of God looked down from heaven (i.e., came and descended), righteousness
was born of the flesh of the Virgin, no phantasm of a body, but the
Truth: for He is the Truth, according to His own witness of Truth: “I am
the Truth and the life.” <span id="fr_2507"></span>[2508](#fn_2507) And
so as we have proved in the earlier books that this Truth; viz., the
Lord Jesus Christ, was God when born of the Virgin, let us now do as we
determined to do in the book before this, and show that He who was to be
born of the Virgin, was always declared to be God beforehand. And so the
prophet Isaiah says, “Cease ye from the man whose breath is in his
nostrils, for it is He in whom he is reputed to be;” or as it is more
exactly and clearly in the Hebrew: “for he is reputed high.” <span
id="fr_2508"></span>[2509](#fn_2508) But by saying “cease ye,” a term
which deprecates violence, he admirably denotes the disturbance of
persecution. “Cease ye,” he says, “from the man whose breath is in his
nostrils, for he is reputed high.” Does he not in one and the same
sentence speak of the taking upon Him of the manhood, and the truth of
His Godhead? “Cease ye,” he says, “from the man whose breath is in his
nostrils, for he is reputed high.” Does he not, I ask you, seem plainly
to address the Lord’s persecutors, and to say, “Cease ye from the man”
whom ye are persecuting, for this man is God: and though He appears in
the lowliness of human flesh, yet He still continues in the high estate
of Divine glory? But by saying “Cease ye from the man whose breath is in
his nostrils,” he admirably showed His manhood, by the clearest tokens
of a human body, and this fearlessly and confidently, as one who would
as urgently assert the truth of His humanity as that of His Godhead, for
this is the true and Catholic faith, to believe that the Lord Jesus
Christ possessed the substance of a true body just as He possessed a
true and perfect Divinity. Unless possibly you think that anything can
be made out of the fact that he uses the word “High” instead of “God”;
whereas it is the habit of holy Scripture to put “High” for “God,” as
where the prophet says: “the Most High uttered His voice and the earth
was moved,” <span id="fr_2509"></span>[2510](#fn_2509) and “Thou alone
art Most High over all the earth.” <span
id="fr_2510"></span>[2511](#fn_2510) Isaiah too, who says this: “The
High and lofty one who inhabiteth eternity”: <span
id="fr_2511"></span>[2512](#fn_2511) where we are clearly to understand
that as he there puts Most High without adding the name of God, so here
too he speaks of God by the name of Most High. So then, <span
id="page_584">p. 584</span> <span id="iv.vii.vi.v-Page_584"></span>since
the Divine word spoken by the prophet clearly announced beforehand that
the Lord Jesus Christ would be both God and man, let us now see whether
the New Testament corresponds to and harmonizes with the testimony of
the Old.

<span id="iv.vii.vi.v-p6"></span> *Dominicus Homo*, literally “the
Lordly man.” The same title is used again by Cassian in Book VI. cc.
xxi., xxii. and in the Conferences XI. xiii. It is however an instance
of a title which the mature judgment of the Church has rejected as
savouring of an heretical interpretation. We learn from Gregory
Nazianzen (Orat. 51) that the Greek equivalent of the title <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.vii.vi.v-p6.1"></span>ὁ</span> <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.vii.vi.v-p6.2"></span>κυριακὸς
ἄνθρωπος</span>, was a favourite term with the Apollinarians, as it
might be taken to favour their view that the Divinity supplied the place
of a human soul in Christ. It is however freely used by Epiphanius in
his Anchoratus, and is also found in the exposition of faith assigned to
Athanasius (Migne. Pat. Græc. xxv. p. 197). And Augustine himself
actually uses the title Dominicus Homo in his treatise on the Sermon on
the Mount, Book II. c. vi., though he afterwards retracted the term, see
“Retract,” Book I. c. xx. “Non video utrum recte dicatur *Homo
Dominicus*, qui est mediator Dei et hominum, homo Christus Jesus, cum
sit utique Dominus: Dominicus antem homo quis in ejus sancta familia non
potest dici? Et hoc quidem ut dicerem, apud quosdam legi tractores
catholicos divinorum eloquiorum. Sed ubicunque hoc dici, dixisse me
nollem. Postea quippe vidi non esse dicendum, quamvis nonnulla possit
ratione defendi.” The question is discussed by S. Thomas, whether the
title is rightly applied to Christ and decided by him in the negative.
