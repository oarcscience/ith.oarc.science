#### <span id="iv.v.ii.xii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XII.

<span id="iv.v.ii.xii-p1"></span>The answer on the different kinds of
perfection.

<span id="iv.v.ii.xii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.ii.xii-p2.1"></span>Chæremon</span>: In accordance with the
condition and measure of every mind Holy Scripture summons our free
wills to different grades of perfection. For no uniform crown of
perfection can be offered to all men, because all have not the same
virtue, or purpose, or fervour, and so the Divine Word has in some way
appointed different ranks and different measures of perfection itself.
And that this is so the variety of beatitudes in the gospel clearly
shows. For though they are called blessed, whose is the kingdom of
heaven, and blessed are they who shall possess the earth, and blessed
are they who shall receive their consolation, and blessed are they who
shall be filled, yet we believe that there is a great difference between
the habitations of the kingdom of heaven, and the possession of the
earth, whatever it be, and also between the reception of consolation and
the fulness and satisfaction of righteousness; and that there is a great
distinction between those who shall obtain mercy, and those who shall be
deemed worthy to enjoy the most glorious vision of God. “For there is
one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory
of the stars: for star differeth from star in glory, so also is the
resurrection of the dead.” <span id="fr_1719"></span>[1720](#fn_1719.md)
While therefore in accordance with this rule holy Scripture praises
those who fear God, and says “Blessed are all they that fear the
Lord,” <span id="fr_1720"></span>[1721](#fn_1720.md) and promises them for
this a full measure of bliss, yet it says again: “There is no fear in
love, but perfect love casteth out fear: for fear hath torment. But he
that feareth is not yet perfect in love.” <span
id="fr_1721"></span>[1722](#fn_1721.md) And again, though it is a grand
thing to serve God, and it is said: “Serve the Lord in fear;” and: “It
is a great thing for thee to be called My servant;” and: “Blessed is
that servant whom his Lord, when He cometh, shall find so doing,” <span
id="fr_1722"></span>[1723](#fn_1722.md) yet it is said to the Apostles: “I
no longer call you servants, for the servant knoweth not what his Lord
doeth: but I call you friends, for all things whatsoever I have heard
from my Father, I have made known unto you.” <span
id="fr_1723"></span>[1724](#fn_1723.md) And once more: “Ye are My friends,
if ye do whatever I command you.” <span
id="fr_1724"></span>[1725](#fn_1724.md) You see then that there are
different stages of perfection, and that we are called by the Lord from
high things to still higher in such a way that he who has become blessed
and perfect in the fear of God; going as it is written “from strength to
strength,” <span id="fr_1725"></span>[1726](#fn_1725.md) and from one
perfection to another, i.e., mounting with keenness of soul from fear to
hope, is summoned in the end to that still more blessed stage, which, is
love, and he who has been “a faithful and wise servant” <span
id="fr_1726"></span>[1727](#fn_1726.md) will pass to the companionship of
friendship and to the adoption of sons. So then our saying also must be
understood according to this meaning: not that we say that the
consideration of that enduring punishment or of that blessed recompense
which is promised to the saints is of no value, but because, though they
are useful and introduce those who pursue them to the first beginning of
blessedness, yet again love, wherein is already fuller confidence, and a
lasting joy, will remove them from servile fear and mercenary hope to
the love of God, and carry them on to the adoption of sons, and somehow
make them from being perfect still more perfect. For the Saviour says
that in His Father’s house are “many mansions,” <span
id="fr_1727"></span>[1728](#fn_1727.md) and although all the stars seem to
be in the sky, yet there is a mighty difference between the brightness
of the sun and of the moon, and between that of the morning star and the
rest of the stars. And therefore the blessed Apostle prefers it not only
above fear and hope but also above all gifts which are counted great and
wonderful, and shows the way of love still more excellent than all. For
when after finishing his list of spiritual gifts of virtues he wanted to
describe its members, he began as follows: “And yet I show unto you a
still more excellent way. Though I speak with the tongues of men and
angels, and though I have the gift of prophecy and know all mysteries
and all knowledge, and though I have all faith so that I can remove
mountains, and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and give
my body to be burned, <span id="page_421">p. 421</span> <span
id="iv.v.ii.xii-Page_421"></span>but have not love, it profiteth me
nothing.” You see then that nothing more precious, nothing more perfect,
nothing more sublime, and, if I may say so, nothing more enduring can be
found than love. For “whether there be prophecies, they shall fail,
whether there be tongues, they shall cease, whether there be knowledge,
it shall be destroyed,” but “love never faileth,” <span
id="fr_1728"></span>[1729](#fn_1728.md) and without it not only those most
excellent kinds of gifts, but even the glory of martyrdom itself will
fail.
