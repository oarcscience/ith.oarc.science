#### <span id="iv.vii.vi.xiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIV.

<span id="iv.vii.vi.xiv-p1"></span>He refutes the wicked and blasphemous
notion of the heretics who said that God dwelt and spoke in Christ as in
an instrument or a statue.

<span id="iv.vii.vi.xiv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.vi.xiv-p2.1"></span>Otherwise</span>, as the heretics say,
God would be in the Lord Jesus Christ as in a statue or in an
instrument, i.e., He would dwell as it were in a man and speak as it
were through a man, and it would not be He who dwelt and spoke as God of
Himself and in His own body: and certainly He had already thus dwelt in
the saints and spoken in the persons of the saints. In those men too, of
whom I spoke above, who had prayed for His advent, He had thus dwelt and
spoken. And what need was there for all these to ask for what they
already possessed, if they were seeking for what they had previously
received? Or why should they long to see with their eyes what they were
keeping in their hearts, especially as it is better for a man to have
the same thing within himself than to see it outside? Or if God was to
dwell in Christ in the same way as in all the saints, why should all the
saints long to see Christ rather than themselves? And if they were only
to see the same thing in Jesus Christ, which they themselves possessed,
why should they not much rather prefer to have this in themselves than
to see it in another? But you are wrong, you wretched madman, “not
understanding,” as the Apostle says, “what you say and whereof you
affirm”: <span id="fr_2540"></span>[2541](#fn_2540.md) for all the prophets
and all the saints received from God some portion of the Divine Spirit
as they were able to bear it. But in Christ “all the fulness of the
Godhead” dwelt and “dwells bodily.” And therefore they all fall far
short of His fulness, from whose fulness they receive something: for the
fact that they are filled is the gift of Christ: because they would all
certainly be empty, were He not the fulness of all.
