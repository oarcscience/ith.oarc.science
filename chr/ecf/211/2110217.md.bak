#### <span id="ii.vi.ii.xxviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXVIII.

<span id="ii.vi.ii.xxviii-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.vi.ii.xxviii-p1.1"></span>Luke</span> made known the doings of
the apostles up to the time when Paul was brought to Rome under the
emperor Nero. As to Nero, I shall not say that he was the worst of
kings, but that he was worthily held the basest of all men, and even of
wild beasts. It was he who first began a persecution; and I am not sure
but he will be the last also to carry it on, if, indeed, we admit, as
many are inclined to believe, that he will yet appear immediately before
the coming of Antichrist. Our subject would induce me to set forth his
vices at some length, if it were not inconsistent with the purpose of
this work to enter upon so vast a topic. I content myself with the
remark, that he showed himself in every way most abominable and cruel,
and at length even went so far as to be the murderer of his own mother.
After this, he also married a certain Pythagoras in the style of solemn
alliances, the bridal veil being put upon the emperor, while the usual
dowry, and the marriage couch, and wedding torches, and, in short, all
the other observances were forthcoming—things which even in the case of
women, are not looked upon without some feeling of modesty. But as to
his other actions, I doubt whether the description of them would excite
greater shame or sorrow. He first attempted to abolish the name of
Christian, in accordance with the fact that vices are always inimical to
virtues, and that all good men are ever regarded by the wicked as
casting reproach upon them. For, at that time, our divine religion had
obtained a wide prevalence in the city. Peter was there executing the
office of bishop, and Paul, too, after he had been brought to Rome, on
appealing to Cæsar from the unjust judgment of the governor. Multitudes
then came together to hear Paul, and these, influenced by the truth
which they were given to know, and by the miracles <span
id="fr_352"></span>[353](#fn_352.md) of the apostles, which they then so
frequently performed, turned to the worship of God. For then took place
the well-known and celebrated encounter of Peter and Paul with
Simon. <span id="fr_353"></span>[354](#fn_353.md) He, after he had flown up
into the air by his magical arts, and supported by two demons (with the
view of proving that he was a god), the demons being put to flight by
the prayers of the apostles, fell to the earth in the sight of all the
people, and was dashed to pieces.
