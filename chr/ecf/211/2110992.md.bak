#### <span id="iv.vi.iv.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.

<span id="iv.vi.iv.v-p1"></span>Of the method of penitence and the proof
of pardon.

<span id="iv.vi.iv.v-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.v-p2.1"></span>Wherefore</span> in order to satisfy as
briefly and shortly as possible, your desire and question, the full and
perfect description of penitence is, never again to yield to those sins
for which we do penance, or for which our conscience is pricked. But the
proof of satisfaction and pardon is for us to have expelled the love of
them from our hearts. For each one may be sure that he is not yet free
from his former sins as long as any image of those sins which he has
committed or of others like them dances before his eyes, and I will not
say a delight in—but the recollection of—them haunts his inmost soul
while he is devoting himself to satisfaction for them and to tears. And
so one who is on the watch to make satisfaction may then feel sure that
he is free from his sins and that he has obtained pardon for past
faults, when he never feels that his heart is stirred by the allurements
and imaginations of these same sins. Wherefore the truest test of
penitence and witness of pardon is found in our own conscience, which
even before the day of judgment and of knowledge, while we are still in
the flesh, discloses our acquittal from guilt, and reveals the end of
satisfaction and the grace of forgiveness. And that what has been said
may be more significantly expressed, then only should we believe that
the stains of past sins are forgiven us, when the desires for present
delights as well as the passions have been expelled from our heart.
