#### <span id="iv.v.vi.ii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.

<span id="iv.v.vi.ii-p1"></span>Wherein one ought to admire the saints.

<span id="iv.v.vi.ii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.vi.ii-p2.1"></span>Wherefore</span> we never ought to admire
those who affect these things, for these powers, but rather to look
whether they are perfect in driving out all sins, and amending their
ways, for this is granted to each man not for the faith of some other,
or for a variety of reasons, but for his own earnestness, by the action
of God’s grace. For this is practical knowledge which is termed by
another name by the Apostle; viz., love, and is by the authority of the
Apostle preferred to all tongues of men and of angels, and to full
assurance of faith which can even remove mountains, and to all
knowledge, and prophecy, and to the distribution of all one’s goods, and
finally to the glory of martyrdom itself. For when he had enumerated all
kinds of gifts and had said: “To one is given by the Spirit the word of
wisdom, to another the word of knowledge, to another faith, to another
the gift of healing, to another the working of miracles, etc.:” <span
id="fr_1943"></span>[1944](#fn_1943.md) when he was going to speak about
love notice how in a few words he put it before all gifts: “And yet,” he
says, “I show unto you a still more excellent way.” <span
id="fr_1944"></span>[1945](#fn_1944.md) By which it is clearly shown that
the height of perfection and blessedness does not consist in the
performance of those wonderful works but in the purity of love. And this
not without good reason. For all those things are to pass away and be
destroyed, but love is to abide for ever. And so we have never found
that those works and signs were affected by our fathers: nay, rather
when they did possess them by the grace of the Holy Spirit they would
never use them, unless perhaps extreme and unavoidable necessity drove
them to do so.
