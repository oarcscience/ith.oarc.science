#### <span id="iv.v.ii.xiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIV.

<span id="iv.v.ii.xiv-p1"></span>A question about complete chastity.

<span id="iv.v.ii.xiv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.ii.xiv-p2.1"></span>Germanus</span>: Now that you have finished
your discourse on perfect chastity, we want also to ask somewhat more
freely about the end of chastity. For we do not doubt that those lofty
heights of love, by which, as you have hitherto explained, we mount to
the image and likeness of God, cannot possibly exist without perfect
purity. But we should like to know whether a lasting grant of it can be
secured so that no incitement to lust may ever disturb the serenity of
our heart, and that thus we may be enabled to pass the time of our
sojourneying in the flesh free from this carnal passion, so as never to
be inflamed by the fire of excitement.
