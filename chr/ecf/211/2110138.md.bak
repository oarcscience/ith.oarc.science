#### <span id="ii.vi.i.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.

<span id="ii.vi.i.iv-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.vi.i.iv-p1.1"></span>Then</span> Noah first of all erected an
altar to God, and offered sacrifices from among the birds. <span
id="fr_251"></span>[252](#fn_251.md) Immediately afterwards he was blessed
by God along with his sons, and received a command that he should not
eat blood, or shed the blood of any human being, because Cain, having no
such precept, had stained the first age of the world. Accordingly, the
sons of Noah were alone left in the then vacant world; for he had three,
Shem, Ham, and Japhet. But Ham, because he had mocked his father when
senseless with wine, incurred his father’s curse. His son, Chas by name,
begat the giant Nebroth, <span id="fr_252"></span>[253](#fn_252.md) by whom
the city of Babylon is said to have been built. Many other towns are
related to have been founded at that time, which I do not here intend to
name one by one. But although the human race was now multiplied, and men
occupied different places and islands, nevertheless all made use of one
tongue, as long as the multitude, afterwards to be scattered through the
whole world, kept itself in one body. These, after the manner of human
nature, formed the design of obtaining a great name by constructing some
great work before they should be separated from one another. They
therefore attempted to build a tower which should reach up to heaven.
But by the ordination of God, in order that the labors of those engaged
in the work might be hindered, they began to speak in a kind of
languages very different from their accustomed form of speech, while no
one understood the others. This led to their being all the more readily
dispersed, because, regarding each other as foreigners, they were easily
induced to separate. And the world was so divided to the sons of Noah,
that Shem occupied the East, Japhet the West, and Ham the intermediate
parts. After this, till the time of Abraham, <span
id="fr_253"></span>[254](#fn_253.md) their genealogy presented nothing very
remarkable or worthy of record.

<span id="ii.vi.i.iv-p2"></span> Not of *birds* only, but other animals
also. [Gen. viii. 20](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#020.md)<span

<span id="ii.vi.i.iv-p3"></span> This is the *Nimrod* of the A.V.; he is
called *Nebrod* by the LXX. We have, for the most part, given the proper
names as they appear in the edition of Halm.

<span id="fn_253"></span>[72:254](2110138.htm#fr_253.md) <span
id="ii.vi.i.iv-p3.1"></span>

<span id="ii.vi.i.iv-p4"></span> Such is the form of the name as given
by Halm, though *Abram* would be expected.
