as is there the custom for all monks starting on a journey, and himself
led us as guide of our road to his own city, i.e., Panephysis, the lands
of which and indeed the greater part of the neighbouring region
(formerly an extremely rich one since from it, as report says,
everything was supplied for the royal table), had been covered by the
sea which was disturbed by a sudden earthquake and overflowed its banks,
and so (almost all the villages being in ruins) covered what were
formerly rich lands with salt marshes, so that you might think that what
is spiritually sung in the psalm was a literal prophecy of that region.
“He hath turned rivers into a wilderness; and the springs of waters into
a thirsty land: a fruitful land into saltness for the wickedness of them
that dwell therein.” <span id="fr_1688"></span>[1689](#fn_1688) In these
districts then many towns perched in this way on the higher hills were
deserted by their inhabitants and turned by the inundation into islands,
and these afforded the desired solitude to the holy anchorites, among
whom three old men; viz., Chæremon, Nesteros and Joseph, stood out as
anchorites of the longest standing.
