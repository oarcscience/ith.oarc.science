#### <span id="iv.vi.vii.vii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.

<span id="iv.vi.vii.vii-p1"></span>How those who maintain that a man can
be without sin are charged with a twofold error.

<span id="iv.vi.vii.vii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.vii.vii-p2.1"></span>The</span> reason however which drives us
into this error is that, as we are utterly ignorant <span
id="page_524">p. 524</span> <span id="iv.vi.vii.vii-Page_524"></span>of
the virtue of being without sin, <span
id="fr_2256"></span>[2257](#fn_2256) we fancy that we cannot contract
any guilt from those idle and random vagaries of our thoughts, but being
rendered stupid by dullness and as it were smitten with blindness we can
see nothing in ourselves but capital offences, and think that we have
only to keep clear of those things which are condemned also by the
severity of secular laws, and if we find that even for a short time we
are free from these we at once imagine that there is no sin at all in
us. Accordingly we are distinguished from the number of those who see,
because we do not see the many small stains, which are crowded together
in us, and are not smitten with saving contrition, if the malady of
vexation overtakes our thoughts, nor are we sorry that we are struck by
the suggestions of vainglory, nor do we weep over our prayers offered up
so tardily and coldly, nor consider it a fault if while we are singing
or praying, something else besides the actual prayer or Psalm fills our
thoughts, nor are we horrified because we do not blush to conceive many
things which we are ashamed to speak or do before men, in our heart,
which, as we know, lies open to the Divine gaze; nor do we purge away
the pollution of filthy dreams with copious ablutions of our tears, nor
grieve that in the pious act of almsgiving when we are assisting the
needs of the brethren, or ministering support to the poor, the
brightness of our cheerfulness is clouded over by a stingy delay, nor do
we think that we are affected by any loss when we forget God and think
about things that are temporal and corrupt, so that these words of
Solomon fairly apply to us: “They smite me but I have not grieved, and
they have mocked me, but I knew it not.” <span
