#### <span id="iv.vi.v.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.

<span id="iv.vi.v.vi-p1"></span>How the grace of the gospel supports the
weak so that they can obtain pardon, as it secures to the perfect the
kingdom of God.

<span id="iv.vi.v.vi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.v.vi-p2.1"></span>And</span> as the word of the gospel raises
those that are strong to sublime and lofty heights, so it suffers not
the weak to be dragged down to the depths, for it secures to the perfect
the fulness of blessing, and brings to those who are overcome through
weakness pardon. For the law placed those who fulfilled its commands in
a sort of middle state between what they deserved in either case,
severing them from the condemnation due to transgressors, as it also
kept them away from the glory of the perfect. But how wretched and
miserable this is, you can see from comparing the state of this present
life, in which it is considered a very poor thing for a man to sweat and
labour only to avoid being regarded as guilty among good men, not also
to be esteemed rich and honourable and renowned.

remain under the grace of the gospel or under the terror of the
law.](2111007.md)
