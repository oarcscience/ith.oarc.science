down with regard to the character of prayer.

the actual force of the names and words, and discuss what is the
difference between prayer and supplication and intercession; then in
like manner we must investigate whether they are to be offered
separately or all together; and in the third place must examine whether
the particular order which is thus arranged by the Apostle’s authority
has anything further to teach the hearer, or whether the distinction
simply is to be taken, and it should be considered that they were
arranged by him indifferently in such a way: a thing which seems to me
utterly absurd. For one must not believe that the Holy Spirit uttered
anything casually or without reason through the Apostle. And so we will,
as the Lord grants us, consider them in the same order in which we
began.
