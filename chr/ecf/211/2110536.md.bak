#### <span id="iv.iii.xii.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.

<span id="iv.iii.xii.v-p1"></span>That incentives to all sins spring
from pride.

<span id="iv.iii.xii.v-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span

destroyed by it, produced the weaknesses and materials of all faults.

efforts he could obtain the glory of Deity, he actually lost that glory
which he already possessed through the free gift of the Creator.
