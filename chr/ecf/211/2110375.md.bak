#### <span id="iv.iii.v.ii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.

<span id="iv.iii.v.ii-p1"></span>How the occasions of these faults,
being found in everybody, are ignored by everybody; and how we need the
Lord’s help to make them plain.

<span id="iv.iii.v.ii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.v.ii-p2.1"></span>And</span> of these passions as the
occasions are recognized by everybody as soon as they are laid open by
the teaching of the elders, so before they are revealed, although we are
all overcome by them, and they exist in every one, yet nobody knows of
them. But we trust that we shall be able in some measure to explain
them, if by your prayers that word of the Lord, which was announced by
Isaiah, may apply to us also—“I will go before thee, and bring low the
mighty ones of the land, I will break the gates of brass, and cut
asunder the iron bars, and I will open to thee concealed treasures and
hidden secrets” <span id="fr_819"></span>[820](#fn_819.md) —so that the
word of the Lord may go before us also, and first may bring low the
mighty ones of our land, i.e. these same evil passions which we are
desirous to overcome, and which claim for themselves dominion and a most
horrible tyranny in our mortal body; and may make them yield to our
investigation and explanation, and thus breaking the gates of our
ignorance, and cutting asunder the bars of vices which shut us out from
true knowledge, may lead to the hidden things of our secrets, and reveal
to us who have been illuminated, according to the Apostle’s word, “the
hidden things of darkness, and may make manifest the counsels of the
hearts,” <span id="fr_820"></span>[821](#fn_820.md) that thus penetrating
with pure eyes of the mind to the foul darkness of vices, we may be able
to disclose them and drag them forth to light; and may succeed in
explaining their occasions and natures to those who are either free from
them, or are still tied and bound by them, and so passing as the prophet
says, <span id="fr_821"></span>[822](#fn_821.md) through the fire of vices
which terribly inflame our minds, we may be able forthwith to pass also
through the water of virtues which extinguish them unharmed, and being
bedewed (as it were) with spiritual remedies may be found worthy to be
brought in purity of heart to the consolations of perfection.
