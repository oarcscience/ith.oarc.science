#### <span id="ii.vi.i.vii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.

<span id="ii.vi.i.vii-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.vi.i.vii-p1.1"></span>Almost</span> at the same time, when
Abraham was now a hundred years old, his son Isaac was born. Then Sara
expelled the maid-servant by whom Abraham had had a son; and she is said
to have dwelt in the desert along with her son, and defended by the help
of God. Not long after this, God tried the faith of Abraham, and
required that his son Isaac should be sacrificed to him by his father.
Abraham did not hesitate to offer him, and had already laid the lad upon
the altar, and was drawing the sword to slay him, when a voice came from
heaven commanding him to spare the young man; and a ram was found at
hand to be for a victim. When the sacrifice was offered, God spoke to
Abraham, and promised him those things which he had already said he
would bestow. But Sara died in her one hundred and twenty-seventh year,
and her body was, through the care of her husband, buried in Hebron, a
town of the Canaanites, for Abraham was staying in that place. Then
Abraham, seeing that his son Isaac was now of youthful <span
id="fr_257"></span>[258](#fn_257.md) age, for he was, in fact, in his
fortieth year, enjoined his servant to seek a wife for him, but only
from that tribe and territory from which he himself was known to be
descended. He was instructed, however, on finding the girl, to bring her
into the land of the Canaanites, and not to suppose that Isaac would
return into the country of his father for the purpose of obtaining a
wife. In order that the servant might carry out those instructions
zealously, Abraham administered an oath to him, while his hand rested on
the thigh of his master. The servant accordingly set out for
Mesopotamia, and came to the town of Nachor, the brother of Abraham. He
entered into the house of Bathuel, the Syrian, son of Nachor; and having
seen Rebecca, a beautiful virgin, the daughter of Nachor, he asked for
her, and brought her to his master. After this, Abraham took a wife
named Kethurah, who is called in the Chronicles his concubine, and begat
children by her. But he left his possessions to Isaac, the son of Sara,
while, at the same time, he distributed gifts to those whom he had
begotten by his concubines; and thus they were separated from Isaac.
Abraham <span id="page_74">p. 74</span> <span
id="ii.vi.i.vii-Page_74"></span>died after a life of a hundred and
seventy-five years; and his body was laid in the tomb of Sara his wife.

that he ceased to be a mere *adolescens*, and had reached the flower of
his age.
