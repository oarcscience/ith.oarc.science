#### <span id="iii.xxiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXIII.

<span id="iii.xxiv-p1"></span>On Development in Religious Knowledge.

<span id="iii.xxiv-p2"></span>\[54.\] <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.xxiv-p2.1"></span>But</span> some one will say, perhaps, Shall
there, then, be no progress in Christ’s Church? Certainly; all possible
progress. For what being is there, so envious of men, so full of hatred
to God, who would seek to forbid it? Yet on condition that it be real
<span id="page_148">p. 148</span> <span
id="iii.xxiv-Page_148"></span>progress, not alteration of the faith. For
progress requires that the subject be enlarged n itself, alteration,
that it be transformed into something else. The intelligence, then, the
knowledge, the wisdom, as well of individuals as of all, as well of one
man as of the whole Church, ought, in the course of ages and centuries,
to increase and make much and vigorous progress; but yet only in its own
kind; that is to say, in the same doctrine, in the same sense, and in
the same meaning.

<span id="iii.xxiv-p3"></span>\[55.\] The growth of religion in the soul
must be analogous to the growth of the body, which, though in process of
years it is developed and attains its full size, yet remains still the
same. There is a wide difference between the flower of youth and the
maturity of age; yet they who were once young are still the same now
that they have become old, insomuch that though the stature and outward
form of the individual are changed, yet his nature is one and the same,
his person is one and the same. An infant’s limbs are small, a young
man’s large, yet the infant and the young man are the same. Men when
full grown have the same number of joints that they had when children;
and if there be any to which maturer age has given birth these were
already present in embryo, so that nothing new is produced in them when
old which was not already latent in them when children. This, then, is
undoubtedly the true and legitimate rule of progress, this the
established and most beautiful order of growth, that mature age ever
develops in the man those parts and forms which the wisdom of the
Creator had already framed beforehand in the infant. Whereas, if the
human form were changed into some shape belonging to another kind, or at
any rate, if the number of its limbs were increased or diminished, the
result would be that the whole body would become either a wreck or a
monster, or, at the least, would be impaired and enfeebled.

<span id="iii.xxiv-p4"></span>\[56.\] In like manner, it behoves
Christian doctrine to follow the same laws of progress, so as to be
consolidated by years, enlarged by time, refined by age, and yet,
withal, to continue uncorrupt and unadulterate, complete and perfect in
all the measurement of its parts, and, so to speak, in all its proper
members and senses, admitting no change, no waste of its distinctive
property, no variation in its limits.

<span id="iii.xxiv-p5"></span>\[57.\] For example: Our forefathers in
the old time sowed wheat in the Church’s field. It would be most unmeet
and iniquitous if we, their descendants, instead of the genuine truth of
corn, should reap the counterfeit error of tares. This rather should be
the result,—there should be no discrepancy between the first and the
last. From doctrine which was sown as wheat, we should reap, in the
increase, doctrine of the same kind—wheat also; so that when in process
of time any of the original seed is developed, and now flourishes under
cultivation, no change may ensue in the character of the plant. There
may supervene shape, form, variation in outward appearance, but the
nature of each kind must remain the same. God forbid that those
rose-beds of Catholic interpretation should be converted into thorns and
thistles. God forbid that in that spiritual paradise from plants of
cinnamon and balsam, darnel and wolfsbane should of a sudden shoot
forth.

<span id="iii.xxiv-p6"></span>Therefore, whatever has been sown by the
fidelity of the Fathers in this husbandry of God’s Church, the same
ought to be cultivated and taken care of by the industry of their
children, the same ought to flourish and ripen, the same ought to
advance and go forward to perfection. For it is right that those ancient
doctrines of heavenly philosophy should, as time goes on, be cared for,
smoothed, polished; but not that they should be changed, not that they
should be maimed, not that they should be mutilated. They may receive
proof, illustration, definiteness; but they must retain withal their
completeness, their integrity, their characteristic properties.

<span id="iii.xxiv-p7"></span>\[58.\] For if once this license of
impious fraud be admitted, I dread to say in how great danger religion
will be of being utterly destroyed and annihilated. For if any one part
of Catholic truth be given up, another, and another, and another will
thenceforward be given up as a matter of course, and the several
individual portions having been rejected, what will follow in the end
but the rejection of the whole? On the other hand, if what is new begins
to be mingled with what is old, foreign with domestic, profane with
sacred, the custom will of necessity creep on universally, till at last
the Church will have nothing left untampered with, nothing
unadulterated, nothing sound, nothing pure; but where formerly there was
a sanctuary of chaste and undefiled truth, thenceforward there will be a
brothel of impious and base errors. May God’s mercy avert this
wickedness from the minds of his servants; be it rather the frenzy of
the ungodly.

<span id="iii.xxiv-p8"></span>\[59.\] But the Church of Christ, the
careful and watchful guardian of the doctrines deposited in her charge,
never changes anything in them, never diminishes, never adds, does not
cut off what is necessary, does not add what is superfluous, does not
lose her own, <span id="page_149">p. 149</span> <span
id="iii.xxiv-Page_149"></span>does not appropriate what is another’s,
but while dealing faithfully and judiciously with ancient doctrine,
keeps this one object carefully in view,—if there be anything which
antiquity has left shapeless and rudimentary, to fashion and polish it,
if anything already reduced to shape and developed, to consolidate and
strengthen it, if any already ratified and defined, to keep and guard
it. Finally, what other object have Councils ever aimed at in their
decrees, than to provide that what was before believed in simplicity
should in future be believed intelligently, that what was before
preached coldly should in future be preached earnestly, that what was
before practised negligently should thenceforward be practised with
double solicitude? This, I say, is what the Catholic Church, roused by
the novelties of heretics, has accomplished by the decrees of her
Councils,—this, and nothing else,—she has thenceforward consigned to
posterity in writing what she had received from those of olden times
only by tradition, comprising a great amount of matter in a few words,
and often, for the better understanding, designating an old article of
the faith by the characteristic of a new name. <span
