#### <span id="iv.iii.iv.xxxiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXIII.

<span id="iv.iii.iv.xxxiii-p1"></span>How it is that, just as a great
reward is due to the monk who labours according to the regulations of
the fathers, so likewise punishment must he inflicted on an idle one;
and therefore no one should be admitted into a monastery too easily.

<span id="iv.iii.iv.xxxiii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.iv.xxxiii-p2.1"></span>For</span> as unbounded glory
hereafter is promised to those who faithfully serve God and cleave to
Him according to the rule of this system; so the severest penalties are
in store for those who have carried it out carelessly and coldly, and
have failed to show to Him fruits of holiness corresponding to what they
professed or what they were believed by men to be. For “it is better,”
as Scripture says, “that a man should not vow rather than that he should
vow and not pay;” and “Cursed is he that doeth the work of the Lord
carelessly.” <span id="fr_793"></span>[794](#fn_793) Therefore you were
for a long while declined by us, not as if we did not desire with all
our hearts to secure your salvation and the salvation of all, nor as if
we did not care to go to meet even afar off those who are longing to be
converted to Christ; but for fear lest if we received you rashly we
might make ourselves guilty in the sight of God of levity, and make you
incur a yet heavier punishment, if, when you had been too easily
admitted by us without realizing the responsibility of this profession,
you had afterwards turned out a deserter or lukewarm. Wherefore you
ought in the first instance to learn the actual reason for the
renunciation of the world, and when you have seen this, you can be
taught more plainly what you ought to do, from the reason for it.
