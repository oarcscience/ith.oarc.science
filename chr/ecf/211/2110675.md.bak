#### <span id="iv.iv.vi.xii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XII.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.xii-p1"></span>How vainglory may be useful to us.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.xii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.vi.xii-p2.1"></span>But</span> in one matter vainglory is
found to be a useful thing for beginners. I mean by those who are still
troubled by carnal sins, as for instance, if, when they are troubled by
the spirit of fornication, they formed an idea of the dignity of the
priesthood, or of reputation among all men, by which they may be thought
saints and immaculate: and so with these considerations they repell the
unclean suggestions of lust, as deeming them base and at least unworthy
of their rank and reputation; and so by means of a smaller evil they
overcome a greater one. For it is better for a man to be troubled by the
sin of vainglory than for him to fall into the desire for fornication,
from which he either cannot recover at all or only with great difficulty
after he has fallen. <span id="page_345">p. 345</span> <span
id="iv.iv.vi.xii-Page_345"></span>And this thought is admirably
expressed by one of the prophets speaking in the person of God, and
saying: “For My name’s sake I will remove My wrath afar off: and with My
praise I will bridle thee lest thou shouldest perish,” <span
id="fr_1334"></span>[1335](#fn_1334.md) i.e., while you are enchained by
the praises of vainglory, you cannot possibly rush on into the depths of
hell, or plunge irrevocably into the commission of deadly sins. Nor need
we wonder that this passion has the power of checking anyone from
rushing into the sin of fornication, since it has been again and again
proved by many examples that when once a man has been affected by its
poison and plague, it makes him utterly indefatigable, so that he
scarcely feels a fast of even two or three days. And we have often known
some who are living in this desert, confessing that when their home was
in the monasteries of Syria they could without difficulty go for five
days without food, while now they are so overcome with hunger even by
the third hour, that they can scarcely keep on their daily fast to the
ninth hour. And on this subject there is a very neat answer of Abbot
Macarius <span id="fr_1335"></span>[1336](#fn_1335.md) to one who asked him
why he was troubled with hunger as early as the third hour in the
desert, when in the monastery he had often scorned food for a whole
week, without feeling hungry. “Because,” said he, “here there is nobody
to see your fast, and feed and support you with his praise of you: but
there you grew fat on the notice of others and the food of vainglory.”
And of the way in which, as we said, the sin of fornication is prevented
by an attack of vainglory, there is an excellent and significant figure
in the book of Kings, where, when the children of Israel had been taken
captive by Necho, King of Egypt, Nebuchadnezzar, King of Assyria, came
up and brought them back from the borders of Egypt to their own country,
not indeed meaning to restore them to their former liberty and their
native land, but meaning to carry them off to his own land and to
transport them to a still more distant country than the land of Egypt in
which they had been prisoners. And this illustration exactly applies to
the case before us. For though there is less harm in yielding to the sin
of vainglory than to fornication, yet it is more difficult to escape
from the dominion of vainglory. For somehow or other the prisoner who is
carried off to a greater distance, will have more difficulty in
returning to his native land and the freedom of his fathers, and the
prophet’s rebuke will be deservedly aimed at him: “Wherefore art thou
grown old in a strange country? <span
id="fr_1336"></span>[1337](#fn_1336.md) since a man is rightly said to have
grown old in a strange country, if he has not broken up the ground of
his faults. Of pride there are two kinds: (1) carnal, and (2) spiritual,
which is the worse. For it especially attacks those who are seen to have
made progress in some good qualities.
