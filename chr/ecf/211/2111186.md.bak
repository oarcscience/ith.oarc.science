#### <span id="iv.vii.viii.xi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XI.

<span id="iv.vii.viii.xi-p1"></span>How the devil was forced by many
reasons to the view that Christ was God.

<span id="iv.vii.viii.xi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.viii.xi-p2.1"></span>Finally</span> as for the devil himself,
when he was tempting Him with every show of allurements, and every art
of his wickedness, what was it that in his ignorance he suspected, or
wanted to find out by tempting Him? Or what so greatly moved him, that
he sought God under the humble form of man? Had he learned that by
previous proofs? Or had he known of anyone who came as God in man’s
body? Most certainly not. But it was by the mighty evidence of signs, by
mighty results of actions, by the words of the Truth Himself that he was
driven to suspect and examine into this matter: inasmuch as he had
already once heard from John: “Behold the Lamb of God, behold Him who
taketh away the sin of the world.” <span
id="fr_2619"></span>[2620](#fn_2619.md) And again from the same person: “I
have need to be baptized of Thee, and comest Thou to me?” <span
id="fr_2620"></span>[2621](#fn_2620.md) The dove also which came down from
heaven and stopped over the Lord’s head had made itself a clear and open
proof of a God who declared Himself. The voice too which was sent from
God not in riddles or figures had moved him, when it said: “Thou art My
beloved Son, in Thee I am well pleased.” <span
id="fr_2621"></span>[2622](#fn_2621.md) And though he saw a man outwardly
in Jesus, yet he was searching for the Son of God, when he said: “If
Thou art the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.” <span
id="fr_2622"></span>[2623](#fn_2622.md) Did the contemplation of the man
drive away the devil’s suspicions of His Divinity, so that owing to the
fact that he saw a man, he did not believe that He could be God? Most
certainly not. But what does he say? “If Thou art the Son of God,
command that these stones be made bread.” Certainly he had no doubt
about the possibility of that, the existence of which he was examining
into. His anxiety was about its truth. There was no security as to its
impossibility.

[Next: Chapter XII. He compares this notion and reasonable suspicion of
the devil with the obstinate and inflexible idea of his opponents, and
shows that this last is worse and more blasphemous than the
former.](2111187.md)
