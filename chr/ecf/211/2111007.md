#### <span id="iv.vi.v.vii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.

<span id="iv.vi.v.vii-p1"></span>How it lies in our own power to choose
whether to remain under the grace of the gospel or under the terror of
the law.

<span id="iv.vi.v.vii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.v.vii-p2.1"></span>Wherefore</span> it lies today in our own
power whether we choose to live under the grace of the gospel or under
the terrors of the law: for each man must incline to one side or the
other in accordance with the character of his actions, for either the
grace of Christ welcomes those who go beyond the law, or else the law
keeps its hold over the weaker ones as those who are its debtors and
within its clutches. For one who is guilty as regards the precepts of
the law will never be able to attain to the perfection of the gospel,
even though he idly boasts that he is a Christian and freed by the
Lord’s grace: for we must not only regard as still under the law the man
who refuses to fulfil what the law enjoins, but the man as well who is
satisfied with the mere observance of what the law commands, and who
never brings forth fruits worthy of his vocation and the grace of
Christ, where it is not said: “Thou shalt offer to the Lord thy God thy
tithes and firstfruits;” but: “Go and sell all that thou hast and give
to the poor, and come follow Me;” <span
id="fr_2175"></span>[2176](#fn_2175) where, owing to the grandeur of
perfection, to the request of the disciple there is not granted even the
very short space of an hour in which to bury his father, <span
id="fr_2176"></span>[2177](#fn_2176) as the offices of human charity are
outweighed by the virtue of Divine love.
