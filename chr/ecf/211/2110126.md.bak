#### <span id="ii.v.ii.xviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.

<span id="ii.v.ii.xviii-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.ii.xviii-p1.1"></span>Delight</span> thyself rather in fastings
than in feastings, mindful of that widow who did not depart from the
temple, but served God with fastings and prayers day and night. Now, if
she who was a widow, and a Jewish widow, proved herself such, what is it
fitting that a virgin of Christ should now attain to? Love more than any
other thing the feast of the divine word, and desire that you be filled
with spiritual dainties, while you seek for such food as refreshes the
soul, rather than for that which only pleases the body. Flee from all
kinds of flesh and wine, as being the sources of heat and provocatives
to lust. And only then, if need be, use a little wine, when the
stomach’s uneasiness, or great infirmity of body, requires you to do so.
Subdue anger, restrain enmity, and whatever there may be which gives
rise to remorse when it is done, avoid as an abomination giving
rise <span id="fr_223"></span>[224](#fn_223.md) to immediate sin. It is
fitting that that mind should be very tranquil and quiet, as well as
free from all the tumults of anger, which desires to be the
dwelling-place of God, as he testifies through the prophet, saying,
“Upon <span id="fr_224"></span>[225](#fn_224.md) what other man shall I
rest than upon him who is humble and quiet, and who trembleth at my
words?” Believe that God is a witness of all thy deeds and thoughts, and
take good heed lest you either do or think anything which is unworthy of
the divine eyesight. When you desire to engage in prayer, show yourself
in such a frame of mind as becomes one who is to speak with the Lord.

<span id="ii.v.ii.xviii-p2"></span> “velut proximi criminis
abominationem declina”: the text and construction are both very
uncertain, so that we can only make a guess at the meaning.
