#### <span id="ii.vi.ii.xi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XI.

<span id="ii.vi.ii.xi-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.vi.ii.xi-p1.1"></span>There</span> was at that time at Babylon
one Nehemiah, a servant of the king, a Jew by birth, and very much
beloved by Artaxerxes on account of the services he had rendered. He,
having inquired of his fellow-countrymen the Jews, what was the
condition of their ancestral city; and having learned that his native
land remained in the same fallen condition as before, is said to have
been disturbed with all his heart, and to have prayed to God with groans
and many tears. He also called to mind the sins of his nation, and
urgently entreated the divine compassion. Accordingly, the king noticing
that he, while waiting at table, seemed more sorrowful than usual, asked
him to explain the reasons of his grief. Then he began to bewail the
misfortunes of his nation, and the ruin of his ancestral city, which
now, for almost two hundred and fifty years, being leveled with the
ground, furnished a proof of the evils which had been endured, and a
gazing-stock to their enemies. He therefore begged the king to grant him
the liberty of going and restoring it. The king yielded to these dutiful
entreaties, and immediately sent him away with a guard of cavalry, that
he might the more safely accomplish his journey, giving him, at the same
time, letters to the rulers requesting them to furnish him with all that
was necessary. When he arrived at Jerusalem, he distributed the work
connected with the city to the people, man by man; and all vied with
each other in carrying out the orders which they received. And already
the work of rebuilding <span id="fr_339"></span>[340](#fn_339.md) had been
half accomplished, when the jealousy of the surrounding heathen burst
out, and the neighboring cities conspired to interrupt the works, and to
deter the Jews from building. But Nehemiah, having stationed guards
against those making assaults upon the people, was in no degree alarmed,
and carried out what he had begun. And thus, after the wall was
completed, and the entrances of the gates finished, he measured out the
city for the construction by families of houses within it. He reckoned,
also, that the people were not adequate in numbers to the size of the
city; for there were not more of them than fifty thousand of both sexes
and of all ranks—to such an extent had their formerly enormous numbers
been reduced by frequent wars, and by the multitude kept in captivity.
For, of old, those two tribes, of whom the remaining people were all
that survived, had, when the ten tribes were separated from them, been
able to furnish three hundred and twenty thousand armed men. But being
given up by God, on account of their sin, to death and captivity, they
had sunk down to the miserably small number which they now presented.
This company, however, as I have said, consisted only of the two tribes:
the ten <span id="fr_340"></span>[341](#fn_340.md) which had previously
been carried away being scattered among the Parthians, Medes, Indians,
and Ethiopians never returned to their native country, and are to this
day held under the sway of barbarous nations. But the completion of the
restored city is related to have been effected in the thirty-second year
of the reign of Artaxerxes. From that time to the crucifixion of Christ;
that is, to the time when Fufius Geminus and Rubellius were consuls,
there elapsed three hundred and ninety and eight years. But from the
restoration of the temple to its destruction, which was completed by
Titus under Vespasian, when Augustus was consul, there was a period of
four hundred and eighty-three years. That was formerly predicted by
Daniel, who announced that from the restoration of the temple to its
overthrow there would elapse seventy and nine weeks. Now, from the date
of the captivity of the Jews until the time of the restoration of the
city, there were two hundred and sixty years.

<span id="ii.vi.ii.xi-p3"></span> Our author here touches upon a most
interesting question—the ultimate destiny of the ten tribes. He seems to
imply that none of them returned to Palestine, but were wholly absorbed
among the Gentile nations. That, however, cannot be correct, for it was
still possible, in the time of Christ, to speak of some as connected
with the tribe of Asher, one of the ten tribes. See [Luke ii.
36](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#036.md)<span id="ii.vi.ii.xi-p3.1"></span>.
