<span id="iv.iii.i.v-p1"></span>Of their Cords. <span

id="iv.iii.i.v-p3.1"></span>They</span> also wear double scarves <span
id="fr_650"></span>[651](#fn_650.md) woven of woollen yarn which the Greeks
call <span class="Greek"><span id="iv.iii.i.v-p4.1"></span>ἀ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.iii.i.v-p4.2"></span>νάλαβοι</span>, but
which we should name girdles <span id="fr_651"></span>[652](#fn_651.md) or
strings, <span id="fr_652"></span>[653](#fn_652.md) or more properly
cords. <span id="fr_653"></span>[654](#fn_653.md) These falling down over
the top of the neck and divided on either side of the throat go round
the folds (of the robe) at the armpits and gather them up on either
side, so that they can draw up and tuck in close to the body the wide
folds of the dress, and so with their arms girt they are made active and
ready for all kinds of work, endeavouring with all their might to fulfil
the Apostle’s charge: “For these hands have ministered not only to me
but to those also who are with me,” “Neither have we eaten any man’s
bread for nought, but with labour and toil working night and day that we
should not be burdensome to any of you.” And: “If any will not work
neither let him eat.” <span id="fr_654"></span>[655](#fn_654.md)

and cord, the former girding the loins, the latter going round the
shoulders and arms, admonish them that they ought always to be ready for
the service of God and their work.”
