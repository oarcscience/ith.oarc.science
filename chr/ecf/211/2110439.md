#### <span id="iv.iii.vii.xxiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXIII.

<span id="iv.iii.vii.xxiii-p1"></span>An example drawn from the case of
Judas.

<span id="iv.iii.vii.xxiii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.vii.xxiii-p2.1"></span>Would</span> you like to know how
dangerously and harmfully that incitement, unless it has been carefully
eradicated, will shoot up for the destruction of its owner, and put
forth all sorts of branches of different sins? Look at Judas, reckoned
among the number of the apostles, and see how because he would not
bruise the deadly head of this serpent it destroyed him with its poison,
and how when he was caught in the snares of concupiscence, it drove him
into sin and a headlong downfall, so that he was persuaded to sell the
Redeemer of the world and the author of man’s salvation for thirty
pieces of silver. And he could never have been impelled to this heinous
sin of the betrayal if he had not been contaminated by the sin of
covetousness: nor would he have made himself wickedly guilty of
betraying <span id="fr_902"></span>[903](#fn_902) the Lord, unless he
had first accustomed himself to rob the bag intrusted to him.
