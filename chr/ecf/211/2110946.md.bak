#### <span id="iv.v.viii.xxvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXVI.

<span id="iv.v.viii.xxvi-p1"></span>How saintly men cannot be hard and
obstinate.

<span id="iv.v.viii.xxvi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.viii.xxvi-p2.1"></span>Nor</span> must we emit the value of
that command because even if we have bound ourselves by some oath under
the influence of anger or some other passion, (a thing which ought never
to be done by a monk) still the case for each side should be weighed by
a thorough judgment of the mind, and the course on which we have
determined should be compared to that which we are urged to adopt, and
we should without hesitation adopt that which on the occurrence of
sounder considerations is decided to be the best. For it is better to
put our promise on one side than to undergo the loss of something good
and more desirable. Finally we never remember that venerable and
approved fathers were hard and unyielding in decisions of this sort, but
as wax under the influence of heat, so they were modified by reason, and
when sounder counsels prevailed, did not hesitate to give in to the
better side. But those whom we have seen obstinately clinging to their
determinations we have always set down as unreasonable and wanting in
judgment.
