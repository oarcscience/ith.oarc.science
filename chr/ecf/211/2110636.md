#### <span id="iv.iv.iv.xviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xviii-p1"></span>That the continual fear of God must
be bestowed on us by the Lord.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xviii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.iv.xviii-p2.1"></span>And</span> lastly the prophet Jeremiah,
speaking in the person of God, clearly testifies that even the fear of
God, by which we can hold fast to Him, is shed upon us by the Lord:
saying as follows: “And I will give them one heart, and one way, that
they may fear Me all days: and that it may be well with them and with
their children after them. And I will make an everlasting covenant with
them and will not cease to do them good: and I will give My fear in
their hearts that they may not revolt from Me.” <span
id="fr_1276"></span>[1277](#fn_1276) Ezekiel also says: “And I will give
them one heart, and will put a new spirit in their bowels: and I will
take away the stony heart out of their flesh and will give them a heart
of flesh: that they may walk in My commandments, and keep My judgments
and do them: and that they may be My people, and I may be their
God.” <span id="fr_1277"></span>[1278](#fn_1277)
