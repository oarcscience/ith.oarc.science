#### <span id="iv.v.vii.xxiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXIII.

<span id="iv.v.vii.xxiii-p1"></span>How he is the strong and vigorous
man, who yields to the will of another.

<span id="iv.v.vii.xxiii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.vii.xxiii-p2.1"></span>But</span> you must certainly know that
in general he plays a stronger part who subjects his own will to his
brother’s, than he who is found to be the more pertinacious in defending
and clinging to his own decisions. For the former by bearing and putting
up with his neighbour gains the character of being strong and vigorous,
while the latter gains that of being weak and sickly, who must be
pampered and petted so that sometimes for the sake of his peace and
quiet it is a good thing to relax something even in necessary matters.
And indeed in this he need not fancy that he has lost anything of his
own perfection, though by yielding he has given up something of his
intended strictness, but on the contrary he may be sure that he has
gained much more by his virtue of long-suffering and patience. For this
is the Apostle’s command: “Ye who are strong should bear the infirmities
of the weak;” and: “Bear ye one another’s burdens, and so fulfil the law
of Christ.” <span id="fr_2000"></span>[2001](#fn_2000) For a weak man
will never support a weak man, nor can one who is suffering in the same
way, bear or cure one in feeble health, but one who is himself not
subject to infirmity brings remedies to one in weak health. For it is
rightly said to him: “Physician, heal thyself.” <span
