#### <span id="iv.iv.ii.i-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.

<span id="iv.iv.ii.i-p1"></span>Of our stay in Scete, and that which we
proposed to Abbot Moses.

<span id="iv.iv.ii.i-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.ii.i-p2.1"></span>When</span> I was in the desert of Scete,
where are the most excellent monastic fathers and where all perfection
flourishes, in company with the holy father Germanus (who had since the
earliest days and commencement of our spiritual service been my closest
companion both in the Cœnobium and in the desert, so that to show the
harmony of our friendship and aims, everybody would say that a single
heart and soul existed in our two bodies), I sought out Abbot
Moses, <span id="fr_1086"></span>[1087](#fn_1086) who was eminent amid
those splendid flowers, not only in practical but also in contemplative
excellence, in my anxiety to be grounded by his instruction: and
together we implored him to give us a discourse for our edification; not
without tears, for we knew full well his determination never to consent
to open the gate of perfection, except to those who desired it with all
faithfulness, and sought it with all sorrow of heart; for fear lest if
he showed it at random to those who cared nothing for it, or only
desired it in a half-hearted way, by opening what is necessary, and what
ought only to be discovered to those seeking perfection, to unworthy
persons, and such as accepted it with scorn, he might appear to lay
himself open either to the charge of bragging, or to the sin of
betraying his trust; and at last being overcome by our prayers he thus
began.
