#### <span id="iv.iii.v.xxii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXII.

<span id="iv.iii.v.xxii-p1"></span>That we should for this reason
practise bodily abstinence that we may by it attain to a spiritual fast.

<span id="iv.iii.v.xxii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.v.xxii-p2.1"></span>And</span> so we know that we ought
therefore to bestow attention on bodily abstinence, that we may by this
fasting attain to purity of heart. Otherwise our labours will be spent
in vain, if we endure this without weariness, in contemplating the end,
but are unable to reach the end for which we have endured such trials;
and it would have been better to have abstained from the forbidden foods
of the soul than to have fasted with the body from things indifferent
and harmless, for in the case of these latter there is a simple and
harmless reception of a creature of God, which in itself has nothing
wrong about it: but in the case of the former there is at the very first
a dangerous tendency to devour the brethren; of which it is said, “Do
not love backbiting lest thou be rooted out.” <span
id="fr_861"></span>[862](#fn_861.md) And concerning anger and jealousy the
blessed Job says: “For anger slayeth a fool, and envy killeth a
child.” <span id="fr_862"></span>[863](#fn_862.md) And at the same time it
should be noticed that he who is angered is set down as a fool; and he
who is jealous, as a child. For the former is not undeservedly
considered a fool, since of his own accord he brings death upon himself,
being goaded by the stings of anger; and the latter, while he is
envious, proves that he is a child and a minor, for while he envies
another he shows that the one at whose prosperity he is vexed, is
greater than he.
