#### <span id="iv.vii.viii.xvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVI.

<span id="iv.vii.viii.xvi-p1"></span>He shows that like the devil when
tempting Christ, the heretics garble and pervert holy Scripture.

<span id="iv.vii.viii.xvi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.viii.xvi-p2.1"></span>Why</span> then, you heretic, did you
not in this way quote the whole and entire passage which you had read?
So you see that the Apostle laid down that the Lord was “without mother”
in the same way in which he laid down that He was born “without father:”
that we might know that He is “without mother” in the same way in which
we understand Him to be “without father.” And as it is impossible to
believe Him to be altogether “without father,” so we cannot understand
that He is altogether “without mother.” Why then, you heretic, did you
not in this way quote what you had read in the Apostle, entire and
unmutilated? But you insert part, and omit part; and garble the words of
truth in order that you may be able to build up your false notions by
your wicked act. I see who was your master. We must believe that you had
*his* instruction, whose example you are following. For so the devil in
the gospel when tempting the Lord said: “If Thou art the Son of God,
cast Thyself down. For it is written that He shall give His angels
charge concerning Thee to keep Thee in all Thy ways.” <span
id="fr_2627"></span>[2628](#fn_2627.md) And when he had said this, he left
out the context and what belongs to it; viz., “Thou shalt walk upon the
asp and the basilisk: and thou shalt trample under foot the lion and the
dragon.” <span id="fr_2628"></span>[2629](#fn_2628.md) Surely he cunningly
quoted the previous verse and left out the latter: for he quoted the one
to deceive Him: he held his tongue about the latter to avoid condemning
himself. For he knew that he himself was signified by the asp and
basilisk, the lion and dragon in the Prophet’s words. So then you also
bring forward a part and omit a part; and quote the one to deceive; and
omit the other for fear lest if you were to quote the whole, you might
condemn your own deception. But it is now time to pass on to further
matters, for by dwelling too long on particular points, as we are led to
do by the desire of giving a full answer, we exceed the limits even of a
longish book.

[Next: Chapter XVII. That the glory and honour of Christ is not to be
ascribed to the Holy Ghost in such a way as to deny that it proceeds
from Christ Himself, as if all that excellency, which was in Him, was
another's and proceeded from another source.](2111192.md)
