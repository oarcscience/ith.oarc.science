#### <span id="iv.vi.viii.x-p0.1"></span>Chapter X.

<span id="iv.vi.viii.x-p1"></span>A question whether it is bad for a
monk to have his wants supplied by his kinsfolk.

<span id="iv.vi.viii.x-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.viii.x-p2.1"></span>Germanus</span>: On this subject you have
certainly left no room for any further uncertainty. For we are sure that
we cannot possibly keep up our present wretched garb, or our daily going
barefoot in their neighbourhood, and that there we should not even
procure with the same labour what is necessary for our sustenance, as
here we are actually obliged to fetch our water on our necks for three
miles. For shame on our part as well as on theirs would not in the least
allow us to do this before them. However how will it hurt our plan of
life if we are altogether set free from anxiety on the score of
preparing our food, by being supplied by them with all things, and so
give ourselves up simply to reading and prayer, that by the removal of
that labour with which we are now distracted we may devote ourselves
more earnestly to spiritual interests alone?
