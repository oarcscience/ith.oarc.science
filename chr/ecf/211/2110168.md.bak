#### <span id="ii.vi.i.xxxiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXIV.

<span id="ii.vi.i.xxxiv-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.vi.i.xxxiv-p1.1"></span>God</span>, displeased with what had been
done, spoke to Samuel, saying that he repented that he had made Saul
king. The priest reports what he had heard to the king. And ere long,
being instructed by God, he anointed David with the royal oil, while he
was as yet only a little boy <span id="fr_302"></span>[303](#fn_302.md)
living under the care of his father, and acting as a shepherd, while he
was accustomed often to play upon the harp. For this reason, he was
taken afterwards by Saul, and reckoned among the servants of the king.
And the Philistines and Hebrews being at this time hotly engaged in war,
as the armies were stationed opposite to each other, a certain man of
the Philistines named Goliath, a man of marvelous size and strength,
passing along the ranks of his countrymen, cast insults, in the fiercest
terms, upon the enemy, and challenged any one to engage in single combat
with him. Then the king promised a great reward and his daughter in
marriage to any one who should bring home the spoils of that boaster;
but no one out of so great a multitude ventured to make the attempt. In
these circumstances, though still a youth, <span
id="fr_303"></span>[304](#fn_303.md) David offered himself for the contest,
and rejecting the arms by which his yet tender age was weighed down,
simply with a staff and five stones which he had taken, advanced to the
battle. And by the first blow, having discharged one of the stones from
a sling, he overthrew the Philistine; then he cut off the head of his
conquered foe, carried off his spoils, and afterwards laid up his sword
in the temple. In the meanwhile, all the Philistines, turning to flight,
yielded the victory to the Hebrews. But the great favor shown to David
as they were returning from the battle excited the envy of the king.
Fearing, however, that if he put to death one so beloved by all, that
might give rise to hatred against himself and prove disastrous, he
resolved, under an appearance of doing him honor, to expose him to
danger. First then he made him a captain, that he might be charged with
the affairs of war; and next, although he had promised him his daughter,
he broke his word, and gave her to another. Ere long, a younger daughter
of the king, Melchol by name, fell violently in love with David.
Accordingly, Saul sets before David as the condition of obtaining her in
marriage the following proposal: that if he should bring in a hundred
foreskins of the enemy, the royal maiden would be given him in marriage;
for he hoped that the youth, venturing on so great dangers, would
probably perish. But the result proved very different from what he
imagined, for David, according to the proposal made to him, speedily
brought in a hundred foreskins of the Philistines; and thus he obtained
the daughter of the king in marriage.

<span id="ii.vi.i.xxxiv-p2"></span> This is a mistake: David was
undoubtedly then a grown-up young man.
