#### <span id="iv.vi.viii.xviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.

<span id="iv.vi.viii.xviii-p1"></span>A question whether we should be
drawn back to our country by a proper desire for greater silence.

<span id="iv.vi.viii.xviii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.viii.xviii-p2.1"></span>Germanus</span>: Among other kinds of
illusions and mistakes on our part, which by the vain promise of
spiritual advantages have fired us with a longing for our country (as
your holiness has discovered by the keen insight of your mind), this
stands out as the principal reason, that sometimes we are beset by our
brethren and cannot possibly continue in unbroken solitude and continual
silence, as we should like. And by this the course and measure of our
daily abstinence, which we always want to maintain undisturbed for the
chastening of our body, is sure to be interfered with on the arrival of
some of the brethren. And this we certainly feel would never happen in
our own country, where it is impossible to find anyone, or scarcely
anyone who adopts this manner of life.
