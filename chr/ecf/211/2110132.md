### <span id="ii.v.vii-p0.1"></span>Letter VII.

#### <span id="ii.v.vii-p0.2"></span>To an Unknown Person, Begging the Favor of a Letter.

<span id="ii.v.vii-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.vii-p1.1"></span>The</span> faith and piety of souls, no doubt,
remain, but this should be made known by the evidence of a letter, in
order that an increase of affection may be gained by such mutual
courtesy. For just as a fertile field cannot bring forth abundant
fruits, if its cultivation has been neglected, and the good qualities of
soil are lost through the indolence of one who rests, instead of
working, so I think that the love and kindly feelings of the mind grow
feeble, unless those who are absent are visited, as if present, by means
of a letter. <span id="fr_245"></span>[246](#fn_245)
