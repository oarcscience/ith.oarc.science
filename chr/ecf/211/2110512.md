#### <span id="iv.iii.xi.i-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.

<span id="iv.iii.xi.i-p1"></span>How our seventh combat is against the
spirit of vainglory, and what its nature.

<span id="iv.iii.xi.i-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.xi.i-p2.1"></span>Our</span> seventh combat is against the
spirit of <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iii.xi.i-p2.2"></span>κενοδοξία</span>, which we may term vain or
idle glory: a spirit that takes many shapes, and is changeable and
subtle, so that it can with difficulty, I will not say be guarded
against, but be seen through and discovered even by the keenest eyes.
