#### <span id="iv.iv.ii.xx-p0.1"></span>Chapter XX.

<span id="iv.iv.ii.xx-p1"></span>About discerning the thoughts, with an
illustration from a good money-changer.

<span id="iv.iv.ii.xx-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.ii.xx-p2.1"></span>We</span> ought then carefully to notice
this threefold order, and with a wise discretion to analyse the thoughts
which arise in our hearts, tracking out their origin and cause and
author in the first instance, that we may be able to consider how we
ought to yield ourselves to them in accordance with the desert of those
who suggest them so that we may, as the Lord’s command bids us, become
good money-changers, <span id="fr_1147"></span>[1148](#fn_1147.md) whose
highest skill and whose training is to test what is perfectly pure gold
and what is commonly termed *tested*, <span
id="fr_1148"></span>[1149](#fn_1148.md) or what is not sufficiently
purified in the fire; and also with unerring skill not to be taken in by
a common brass denarius, if by being coloured with bright gold it is
made like some coin of great value; and not only shrewdly to recognize
coins stamped with the heads of usurpers, but with a still shrewder
skill to detect those which have the image of the right king, but are
not properly made, and lastly to be careful by the test of the balance
to see that they are not under proper weight. All of which <span
id="page_305">p. 305</span> <span
id="iv.iv.ii.xx-Page_305"></span>things the gospel saying, which uses
this figure, shows us that we ought also to observe spiritually; first
that whatever has found an entrance into our hearts, and whatever
doctrine has been received by us, should be most carefully examined to
see whether it has been purified by the divine and heavenly fire of the
Holy Ghost, or whether it belongs to Jewish superstition, or whether it
comes from the pride of a worldly philosophy and only externally makes a
show of religion. And this we can do, if we carry out the Apostle’s
advice, “Believe not every spirit, but prove the spirits whether they
are of God.” <span id="fr_1149"></span>[1150](#fn_1149.md) But by this kind
those men also are deceived, who after having been professed as monks
are enticed by the grace of style, and certain doctrines of
philosophers, which at the first blush, owing to some pious meanings not
out of harmony with religion, deceive as with the glitter of gold their
hearers, whom they have superficially attracted, but render them poor
and miserable for ever, like men deceived by false money made of copper:
either bringing them back to the bustle of this world, or enticing them
into the errors of heretics, and bombastic conceits: a thing which we
read of as happening to Achan in the book of Joshua the son of
Nun, <span id="fr_1150"></span>[1151](#fn_1150.md) when he coveted a golden
weight from the camp of the Philistines, and stole it, and was smitten
with a curse and condemned to eternal death. In the second place we
should be careful to see that no wrong interpretation fixed on to the
pure gold of Scripture deceives us as to the value of the metal: by
which means the devil in his craft tried to impose upon our Lord and
Saviour as if He was a mere man, when by his malevolent interpretation
he perverted what ought to be understood generally of all good men, and
tried to fasten it specially on to Him, who had no need of the care of
the angels: saying, “For He shall give His angels charge concerning
Thee, to keep Thee in all Thy ways: and in their hands they shall bear
Thee up, lest at any time Thou dash Thy foot against a stone,” <span
id="fr_1151"></span>[1152](#fn_1151.md) by a skilful assumption on his part
giving a turn to the precious sayings of Scripture and twisting them
into a dangerous sense, the very opposite of their true meaning, so as
to offer to us the image and face of an usurper under cover of the gold
colour which may deceive us. Or whether he tries to cheat us with
counterfeits, for instance by urging that some work of piety should be
taken up which as it does come from the true minds of the fathers, leads
under the form of virtue to vice; and, deceiving us either by immoderate
or impossible fasts, or by too long vigils, or inordinate prayers, or
unsuitable reading, brings us to a bad end. Or, when he persuades us to
give ourselves up to mixing in the affairs of others, and to pious
visits, by which he may drive us away from the spiritual cloisters of
the monastery, and the secrecy of its friendly peacefulness, and
suggests that we take on our shoulders the anxieties and cares of
religious women who are in want, that when a monk is inextricably
entangled in snares of this sort he may distract him with most injurious
occupations and cares. Or else when he incites a man to desire the holy
office of the clergy under the pretext of edifying many people, and the
love of spiritual gain, by which to draw us away from the humility and
strictness of our life. All of which things, although they are opposed
to our salvation and to our profession, yet when covered with a sort of
veil of compassion and religion, easily deceive those who are lacking in
skill and care. For they imitate the coins of the true king, because
they seem at first full of piety, but are not stamped by those who have
the right to coin, i.e., the approved Catholic fathers, nor do they
proceed from the head public office for receiving them, but are made by
stealth and by the fraud of the devil, and palmed off upon the unskilful
and ignorant not without serious harm. And even although they seem to be
useful and needful at first, yet if afterwards they begin to interfere
with the soundness of our profession, and as it were to weaken in some
sense the whole body of our purpose, it is well that they should be cut
off and cast away from us like a member which may be necessary, but yet
offends us and which seems to perform the office of the right hand or
foot. For it is better, without one member of a command, i.e., its
working or result, to continue safe and sound in other parts, and to
enter as weak into the kingdom of heaven rather than with the whole mass
of commands to fall into some error which by an evil custom separates us
from our strict rule and the system purposed and entered upon, and leads
to such loss, that it will never outweigh the harm that will follow, but
will cause all our past fruits and the whole body of our work to be
burnt in hell fire. <span id="fr_1152"></span>[1153](#fn_1152.md) Of which
kind of illusions it is well said in the Proverbs: “There are ways which
seem to be right to a man, but their latter end will come into the
depths of hell,” <span id="fr_1153"></span>[1154](#fn_1153.md) and again
“An evil man is harmful when he attaches himself to a good man,” <span
id="fr_1154"></span>[1155](#fn_1154.md) <span id="page_306">p. 306</span>
<span id="iv.iv.ii.xx-Page_306"></span>i.e., the devil deceives when he
is covered with an appearance of sanctity: “but he hates the sound of
the watchman,” <span id="fr_1155"></span>[1156](#fn_1155.md) i.e., the
power of discretion which comes from the words and warnings of the
fathers.
