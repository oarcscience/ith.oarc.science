#### <span id="iv.iv.ix.xv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XV.

<span id="iv.iv.ix.xv-p1"></span>Of the fact that it is not without
reason that the names of angels and archangels are given to holy and
heavenly powers.

<span id="iv.iv.ix.xv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.ix.xv-p2.1"></span>For</span> no one doubts that not without
cause or reason are the same titles of rank assigned to the better sort,
and that they are names of office and of worth or dignity, for it is
plain that they are termed angels, i.e., messengers from their office of
bearing messages, and the appropriateness of the name teaches that they
are “archangels” because they preside over angels, “dominions” because
they hold dominion over certain persons, and “principalities” because
they have some to be princes over, and “thrones” because they are so
near to God and so privy and close to Him that the Divine Majesty
specially rests in them as in a Divine throne, and in a way reclines
surely on them.
