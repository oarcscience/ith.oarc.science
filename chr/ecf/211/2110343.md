#### <span id="iv.iii.iv.xiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIV.

<span id="iv.iii.iv.xiv-p1"></span>How, even if a large sum of money is
amassed by the labour of each, still no one may venture to exceed the
moderate limit of what is appointed as adequate.

<span id="iv.iii.iv.xiv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.iv.xiv-p2.1"></span>And</span> although each one of them may
bring in daily by his work and labour so great a return to the monastery
that he could out of it not only satisfy his own moderate demands but
could also abundantly supply the wants of many, yet he is no way puffed
up, nor does he flatter himself on account of his toil and this large
gain from his labour, but, except two biscuits, <span
id="fr_768"></span>[769](#fn_768.md) which are sold there for scarcely
threepence, no one thinks that he has a right to anything further. And
among them there is nothing (and I am ashamed to say this, and heartily
wish it was unknown in our own monasteries) which is claimed by any of
them, I will not say in deed but even in thought, as <span
id="page_223">p. 223</span> <span id="iv.iii.iv.xiv-Page_223"></span>his
special property. And though he believes that the whole granary of the
monastery forms his substance, and, as lord of all, devotes his whole
care and energy to it all, yet nevertheless, in order to maintain that
excellent state of want and poverty which he has secured and which he
strives to preserve to the very last in unbroken perfection, he regards
himself as a foreigner and an alien to them all, so that he conducts
himself as a stranger and a sojourner in this world, and considers
himself a pupil of the monastery and a servant instead of imagining that
he is lord and master of anything.

<span id="iv.iii.iv.xiv-p3"></span> *Paxamatium*, a biscuit. The word
comes from the Greek <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iii.iv.xiv-p3.1"></span>παξαμάδιον</span>, and is said to be
derived from the name of a baker, <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iii.iv.xiv-p3.2"></span>Παξαμός</span> (see Liddell and Scott, c.
v.). These biscuits formed an important part of the diet of the Egyptian
monks, as we see from the Conferences, where they are often mentioned;
e.g., II. xi, xix., xxiv., xxvi.; XII. xv.; XIX. iv.
