#### <span id="iv.iv.vi.xiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIII.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.xiii-p1"></span>Of the different ways in which all
these faults assault us.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.xiii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.vi.xiii-p2.1"></span>Although</span> then these eight faults
trouble all sorts of men, yet they do not attack them all in the same
way. For in one man the spirit of fornication holds the chief place:
wrath rides rough shod over another: over another vainglory claims
dominion: in an other pride holds the field: and though it is clear that
we are all attacked by all of them, yet the difficulties come to each of
us in very different ways and manners.

faults, when they attack us.](2110677.md)
