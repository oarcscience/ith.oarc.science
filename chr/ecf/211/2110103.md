#### <span id="ii.v.i.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.

<span id="ii.v.i.iii-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.i.iii-p1.1"></span>O how</span> happy shall be that departure
of ours, when Christ shall receive us into his own abode after we have
been purged <span id="fr_142"></span>[143](#fn_142) from the stains of
sin through the experience <span id="fr_143"></span>[144](#fn_143) of a
better life! Martyrs and prophets will meet with us, apostles will join
themselves to us, angels will be glad, archangels will rejoice, and
Satan, being conquered, will look pale, though still retaining his cruel
countenance, inasmuch as he will lose all <span
id="fr_144"></span>[145](#fn_144) advantage from our sins which he had
secured for himself in us. He will see glory granted us through mercy,
and merits honored by means of glory. We shall triumph over our
conquered foe. Where shall now the wise men of the world appear? Where
shall the covetous man, where shall the adulterer, where shall the
irreligious, where shall the drunkard, where shall the evil-speaker be
recognized? What shall these wretched beings say in their own defense?
“We did not know thee, Lord; we did not see that thou wast in the world:
thou didst not send the prophets: thou didst not give the law to the
world: we did not see the patriarchs: we did not read the lives of the
saints. Thy Christ never was upon the earth: Peter was silent: Paul
refused to preach: no Evangelist taught. There were no martyrs whose
example we should follow: no one predicted thy future judgment: no one
commanded us to clothe the poor: no one enjoined us to restrain lust: no
one persuaded us to fight against covetousness: we fell through
ignorance, not knowing what we did.”

<span id="ii.v.i.iii-p2"></span> Clericus here remarks that “these words
clearly teach us that Severus knew of no other purgation than that by
which we are cleansed in this life from sin by a change of character and
which change if we steadily maintain, then, when life is ended, we are
received into the abode of Christ, without any dread of the fire of
purgatory.”

condemned along with himself. The meaning, however, is obscure.
