#### <span id="iv.iii.ix.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.

<span id="iv.iii.ix.iii-p1"></span>To what the soul may be compared
which is a prey to the attacks of dejection.

<span id="iv.iii.ix.iii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.ix.iii-p2.1"></span>For</span> the garment that is moth-eaten
has no longer any commercial value or good use to which it can be put;
and in the same way <span id="fr_953"></span>[954](#fn_953.md) the wood
that is worm-eaten is no longer worth anything for ornamenting even an
ordinary building, but is destined to be burnt in the fire. So therefore
the soul also which is a prey to the attacks of gnawing dejection will
be useless for that priestly garment which, according to the prophecy of
the holy David, the ointment of the Holy Spirit coming down from heaven,
first on Aaron’s beard, then on his skirts, is wont to assume: as it is
said, “It is like the ointment upon the head which ran down upon Aaron’s
beard, which ran down to the skirts of his clothing.” <span
id="fr_954"></span>[955](#fn_954.md) Nor can it have anything to do with
the building or ornamentation of that spiritual temple of which Paul as
a wise master builder laid the foundations, saying, “Ye are the temple
of God, and the Spirit of God dwelleth in you:” <span
id="fr_955"></span>[956](#fn_955.md) and what the beams of this are like
the bride tells us in the Song of Songs: “Our rafters are of cypress:
the beams of our houses are of cedar.” <span
id="fr_956"></span>[957](#fn_956.md) And therefore those sorts of wood are
chosen for the temple of God which are fragrant and not liable to rot,
and which are not subject to decay from age nor to be worm-eaten.
