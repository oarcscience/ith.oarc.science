#### <span id="iv.iii.iv.xxiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXIII.

<span id="iv.iii.iv.xxiii-p1"></span>The obedience of Abbot John by
which he was exalted even to the grace of prophecy.

<span id="iv.iii.iv.xxiii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.iv.xxiii-p2.1"></span>And</span> since this book is about the
training of one who renounces this world, whereby, making a beginning of
true humility and perfect obedience, he may be enabled to ascend the
heights of the other virtues as well, I think it well to set down just
by way of specimen, as we promised, some of the deeds of the elders
whereby they excelled in this virtue, selecting a few only out of many
instances, that, if any are anxious to aim at still greater heights,
they may not only receive from these an incitement towards the perfect
life, but may also be furnished with a model of what they purpose.
Wherefore, to make this book as short as possible we will produce and
set down two or three out of the whole number of the Fathers; and first
of all Abbot John who lived near Lycon <span
id="fr_782"></span>[783](#fn_782.md) which is a town in the Thebaid; and
who was exalted even to the grace of prophecy for his admirable
obedience, and was so celebrated all the world over that he was by his
merits rendered famous even among kings of this world. For though, as we
said, he lived in the most remote parts of the Thebaid, still the
Emperor Theodosius did not venture to declare war against the most
powerful tyrants before he was encouraged by his utterances and replies:
trusting in which as if they had been brought to him from heaven he
gained victories over his foes in battles which seemed hopeless. <span

<span id="iv.iii.iv.xxiii-p3"></span> Lycon or Lycopolis in the Thebaid
is the modern El Syout on the west banks of the Nile, S. E. of
Hermopolis ( = Minieh).

<span id="fn_783"></span>[226:784](2110352.htm#fr_783.md) <span
id="iv.iii.iv.xxiii-p3.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.iv.xxiii-p4"></span> This John of Lycopolis was one of
the most celebrated hermits of the fourth century. Originally a
carpenter, he retired at the age of twenty-five into the wilderness, and
after the death of his instructor settled near Lycopolis. Here, as
Cassian tells us, he received as reward for his obedience the gift of
prophecy, and was consulted by crowds who came to him for this purpose
and among others by the Emperor Theodosius, to whom he foretold (1) his
victory over the usurper Maximus (<span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.iv.xxiii-p4.1"></span>a.d</span>. 388), and (2) his success
against Eugenius in <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.iv.xxiii-p4.2"></span>a.d.</span> 395. He is mentioned again
by Cassian in the Conferences I. xxi., XXIV. xxvi., etc. A full account
of him is given by Rufinus in his history of the monks c. i. and by
Palladius in the Lausiac History 43–60; he is also mentioned by
Augustine De Civitate Dei, Book V. c. xxvi, De Cura pro mortius gerenda,
c. xvii., and Jerome Ep. cxxxiii.<span id="iv.iii.iv.xxiii-p4.3"></span>
ad Ctesiphontem, as well as by Theodoret H. E. V. xxiv, and Sozomen H.
E. VI. xxviii.
