Finally it is in many ways a grander virtue and a more splendid achievement to cure the weaknesses&#146; of one&#146;s own soul than those of the body of another. For just as the soul is higher than the flesh, so is its salvation of more importance, and as its nature is more precious and excellent, so is its destruction more grievous and dangerous.</p>
