#### <span id="iv.iii.v.x-p0.1"></span>Chapter X.

<span id="iv.iii.v.x-p1"></span>That abstinence from food is not of
itself sufficient for preservation of bodily and mental purity.

<span id="iv.iii.v.x-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.v.x-p2.1"></span>In</span> order to preserve the mind and
body in a perfect condition abstinence from food is not alone
sufficient: unless the other virtues of the mind as well are joined to
it. And so humility must first be learned by the virtue of obedience,
and grinding toil <span id="fr_832"></span>[833](#fn_832) and bodily
exhaustion. The possession of money must not only be avoided, but the
desire for it must be utterly rooted out. For it is not enough not to
possess it,—a thing which comes to many as a matter of necessity: but we
ought, if by chance it is offered, not even to admit the *wish* to have
it. The madness of anger should be controlled; the downcast look of
dejection be overcome; vainglory should be despised, the disdainfulness
of pride trampled under foot, and the shifting and wandering thoughts of
the mind restrained by continual recollection of God. And the slippery
wanderings of our heart should be brought back again to the
contemplation of God as often as our crafty enemy, in his endeavour to
lead away the mind a captive from this consideration, creeps into the
innermost recesses of the heart.
