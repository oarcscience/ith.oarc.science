#### <span id="iv.iv.x.xxxiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXIV.

<span id="iv.iv.x.xxxiv-p1"></span>Answer on the different reasons for
prayer being heard.

<span id="iv.iv.x.xxxiv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.x.xxxiv-p2.1"></span>Isaac</span>: That there are different
reasons for prayer being heard in accordance with the varied and
changing condition of souls the words of the gospels and of the prophets
teach us. For you have the fruits of an answer pointed out by our Lord’s
words in the case of the agreement of two persons; as it is said: “If
two of you shall agree upon earth touching anything for which they shall
ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.” <span
id="fr_1629"></span>[1630](#fn_1629.md) You have another in the fulness of
faith, which is compared to a grain of mustard-seed. “For,” He says, “if
you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this
mountain: Be thou removed, and it shall be removed; and nothing shall be
impossible to you.” <span id="fr_1630"></span>[1631](#fn_1630.md) You have
it in continuance in prayer, which the Lord’s words call, by reason of
unwearied perseverance in petitioning, importunity: “For, verily, I say
unto you that if not because of his friendship, yet because of his
importunity he will rise and give him as much as he needs.” <span
id="fr_1631"></span>[1632](#fn_1631.md) You have it in the fruits of
almsgiving: “Shut up alms in the heart of the poor and it shall pray for
thee in the time of tribulation.” <span
id="fr_1632"></span>[1633](#fn_1632.md) You have it in the purifying of
life and in works of mercy, as it is said: “Loose the bands of
wickedness, undo the bundles that oppress;” and after a few words in
which the barrenness of an unfruitful fast is rebuked, “then,” he says,
“thou shalt call and the Lord shall hear thee; thou shalt cry, and He
shall say, Here am I.” <span id="fr_1633"></span>[1634](#fn_1633.md)
Sometimes also excess of trouble causes it to be heard, as it is said:
“When I was in trouble I called unto the Lord, and He heard me;” <span
id="fr_1634"></span>[1635](#fn_1634.md) and again: “Afflict not the
stranger for if he crieth unto Me, I will hear him, for I am
merciful.” <span id="fr_1635"></span>[1636](#fn_1635.md) You see then in
how many ways the gift of an answer may be obtained, so that no one need
be crushed by the despair of his conscience for securing those things
which are salutary and eternal. For if in contemplating our wretchedness
I admit that we are utterly destitute of all those virtues which we
mentioned above, and that we have neither that laudable agreement of two
persons, nor that faith which <span id="page_399">p. 399</span> <span
id="iv.iv.x.xxxiv-Page_399"></span>is compared to a grain of mustard
seed, nor those works of piety which the prophet describes, surely we
cannot be without that importunity which He supplies to all who desire
it, owing to which alone the Lord promises that He will give whatever He
has been prayed to give. And therefore we ought without unbelieving
hesitation to persevere, and not to have the least doubt that by
continuing in them we shall obtain all those things which we have asked
according to the mind of God. For the Lord, in His desire to grant what
is heavenly and eternal, urges us to constrain Him as it were by our
importunity, as He not only does not despise or reject the importunate,
but actually welcomes and praises them, and most graciously promises to
grant whatever they have perseveringly hoped for; saying, “Ask and ye
shall receive: seek and ye shall find: knock and it shall be opened unto
you. For every one that asketh receiveth, and he that seeketh findeth,
and to him that knocketh it shall be opened;” <span
id="fr_1636"></span>[1637](#fn_1636.md) and again: “All things whatsoever
ye shall ask in prayer believing ye shall receive, and nothing shall be
impossible to you.” <span id="fr_1637"></span>[1638](#fn_1637.md) And
therefore even if all the grounds for being heard which we have
mentioned are altogether wanting, at any rate the earnestness of
importunity may animate us, as this is placed in the power of any one
who wills without the difficulties of any merits or labours. But let not
any suppliant doubt that he certainly will not be heard, so long as he
doubts whether he is heard. But that this also shall be sought from the
Lord unweariedly, we are taught by the example of the blessed Daniel,
as, though he was heard from the first day on which he began to pray, he
only obtained the result of his petition after one and twenty
days. <span id="fr_1638"></span>[1639](#fn_1638.md) Wherefore we also ought
not to grow slack in the earnestness of the prayers we have begun, if we
fancy that the answer comes but slowly, for fear lest perhaps the gift
of the answer be in God’s providence delayed, or the angel, who was to
bring the Divine blessing to us, may when he comes forth from the
Presence of the Almighty be hindered by the resistance of the devil, as
it is certain that he cannot transmit and bring to us the desired boon,
if he finds that we slack off from the earnestness of the petition made.
And this would certainly have happened to the above mentioned prophet
unless he had with incomparable steadfastness prolonged and persevered
in his prayers until the twenty-first day. Let us then not be at all
cast down by despair from the confidence of this faith of ours, even
when we fancy that we are far from having obtained what we prayed for,
and let us not have any doubts about the Lord’s promise where He says:
“All things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer believing, ye shall
receive.” <span id="fr_1639"></span>[1640](#fn_1639.md) For it is well for
us to consider this saying of the blessed Evangelist John, by which the
ambiguity of this question is clearly solved: “This is,” he says, “the
confidence which we have in Him, that whatsoever we ask according to His
will, He heareth us.” <span id="fr_1640"></span>[1641](#fn_1640.md) He bids
us then have a full and undoubting confidence of the answer only in
those things which are not for our own advantage or for temporal
comforts, but are in conformity to the Lord’s will. And we are also
taught to put this into our prayers by the Lord’s Prayer, where we say
“Thy will be done,”—*Thine* not ours. For if we also remember these
words of the Apostle that “we know not what to pray for as we
ought” <span id="fr_1641"></span>[1642](#fn_1641.md) we shall see that we
sometimes ask for things opposed to our salvation and that we are most
providentially refused our requests by Him who sees what is good for us
with greater right and truth than we can. And it is clear that this also
happened to the teacher of the Gentiles when he prayed that the
messenger of Satan who had been for his good allowed by the Lord’s will
to buffet him, might be removed, saying: “For which I besought the Lord
thrice that he might depart from me. And He said unto me, My grace is
sufficient for thee, for strength is made perfect in weakness.” <span
id="fr_1642"></span>[1643](#fn_1642.md) And this feeling even our Lord
expressed when He prayed in the character <span
id="fr_1643"></span>[1644](#fn_1643.md) of man which He had taken, that He
might give us a form of prayer as other things also by His example;
saying thus: “Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me:
nevertheless not as I will but as Thou wilt,” <span
id="fr_1644"></span>[1645](#fn_1644.md) though certainly His will was not
discordant with His Father’s will, “For He had come to save what was
lost and to give His life a ransom for many;” <span
id="fr_1645"></span>[1646](#fn_1645.md) as He Himself says: “No man taketh
my life from Me, but I lay it down of Myself. I have power to lay it
down and I have power to take it again.” <span
id="fr_1646"></span>[1647](#fn_1646.md) In which character there is in the
thirty-ninth Psalm the following sung by the blessed David, of the Unity
of will which He ever maintained with the Father: “To do Thy will: O My
God, I am willing.” <span id="fr_1647"></span>[1648](#fn_1647.md) For even
if we read of the Father: “For God so loved the world that He gave His
only begotten <span id="page_400">p. 400</span> <span
id="iv.iv.x.xxxiv-Page_400"></span>Son,” <span
id="fr_1648"></span>[1649](#fn_1648.md) we find none the less of the Son:
“Who gave Himself for our sins.” <span
id="fr_1649"></span>[1650](#fn_1649.md) And as it is said of the One: “Who
spared not His own Son, but gave Him for all of us,” <span
id="fr_1650"></span>[1651](#fn_1650.md) so it is written of the other: “He
was offered because He Himself willed it.” <span
id="fr_1651"></span>[1652](#fn_1651.md) And it is shown that the will of
the Father and of the Son is in all things one, so that even in the
actual mystery of the Lord’s resurrection we are taught that there was
no discord of operation. For just as the blessed Apostle declares that
the Father brought about the resurrection of His body, saying: “And God
the Father, who raised Him from the dead,” <span
id="fr_1652"></span>[1653](#fn_1652.md) so also the Son testifies that He
Himself will raise again the Temple of His body, saying: “Destroy this
temple, and in three days I will raise it up again.” <span
id="fr_1653"></span>[1654](#fn_1653.md) And therefore we being instructed
by all these examples of our Lord which have been enumerated ought to
end our supplications also with the same prayer, and always to subjoin
this clause to all our petitions: “Nevertheless not as I will, but as
Thou wilt.” <span id="fr_1654"></span>[1655](#fn_1654.md) But it is clear
enough that one who does not <span id="fr_1655"></span>[1656](#fn_1655.md)
pray with attention of mind cannot observe that threefold
reverence <span id="fr_1656"></span>[1657](#fn_1656.md) which is usually
practised in the assemblies of the brethren at the close of service.
