<span id="iv.iv.iv.xvi"></span>

#### <span id="iv.iv.iv.xvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVI.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xvi-p1"></span>That faith itself must be given us by
the Lord.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xvi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.iv.xvi-p2.1"></span>But</span> so thoroughly did the Apostles
realize that everything which concerns salvation was given them by the
Lord, that they even asked that faith itself should be granted from the
Lord, saying: “Add to us faith” <span
id="fr_1265"></span>[1266](#fn_1265.md) as they did not imagine that it
could be gained by free will, but believed that it would be bestowed by
the free gift of God. Lastly the Author of man’s salvation teaches us
how feeble and weak and insufficient our faith would be unless it were
strengthened by the aid of the Lord, when He says to Peter “Simon,
Simon, behold Satan hath desired to have you that he may sift you as
wheat. But I have prayed to my Father that thy faith fail not.” <span
id="fr_1266"></span>[1267](#fn_1266.md) And another finding that this was
happening in his own case, and seeing that his faith was being driven by
the waves of unbelief on the rocks which would cause a fearful
shipwreck, asks of the same Lord an aid to his faith, saying “Lord, help
mine unbelief.” <span id="fr_1267"></span>[1268](#fn_1267.md) So thoroughly
then did those Apostles and men in the gospel realize that everything
which is good is brought to perfection by the aid of the Lord, and not
imagine that they could preserve their faith unharmed by their own
strength or free will that they prayed that it might be helped or
granted to them by the Lord. And if in Peter’s case there was need of
the Lord’s help that it might not fail, who will be so presumptuous and
blind as to fancy that he has no need of daily assistance from the Lord
in order to preserve it? Especially <span id="page_328">p. 328</span>
<span id="iv.iv.iv.xvi-Page_328"></span>as the Lord Himself has made
this clear in the gospel, saying: “As the branch cannot bear fruit of
itself except it abide in the vine, so no more can ye, except ye abide
in me.” <span id="fr_1268"></span>[1269](#fn_1268.md) And again: “for
without me ye can do nothing.” <span
id="fr_1269"></span>[1270](#fn_1269.md) How foolish and wicked then it is
to attribute any good action to our own diligence and not to God’s grace
and assistance, is clearly shown by the Lord’s saying, which lays down
that no one can show forth the fruits of the Spirit without His
inspiration and co-operation. For “every good gift and every perfect
boon is from above, coming down from the Father of lights.” <span
id="fr_1270"></span>[1271](#fn_1270.md) And Zechariah too says, “For
whatever is good is His, and what is excellent is from Him.” <span
id="fr_1271"></span>[1272](#fn_1271.md) And so the blessed Apostle
consistently says: “What hast thou which thou didst not receive? But if
thou didst receive it, why boastest thou as if thou hadst not received
it?” <span id="fr_1272"></span>[1273](#fn_1272.md)
