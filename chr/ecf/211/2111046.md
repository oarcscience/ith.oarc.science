#### <span id="iv.vi.vii.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VIII.

<span id="iv.vi.vii.viii-p1"></span>How it is given to but few to
understand what sin is.

<span id="iv.vi.vii.viii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.vii.viii-p2.1"></span>Those</span> on the other hand who make
the sum of all their joy and delight and bliss consist in the
contemplation of divine and spiritual things alone, if they are
unwillingly withdrawn from them even for a short time by thoughts that
force themselves upon them, punish this as if it were a kind of
sacrilege in them, and avenge it by immediate chastisement, and in their
grief that they have preferred some worthless creature (to which their
mental gaze was turned aside) to their Creator, charge themselves with
the guilt (I had almost said) of impiety, and although they turn the
eyes of their heart with the utmost speed to behold the brightness of
the Divine Glory, yet they cannot tolerate even for a very short time
the darkness of carnal thoughts, and execrate whatever keeps back their
soul’s gaze from the true light. Finally when the blessed Apostle John
would instill this feeling into everybody he says: “Little children,
love not the world, neither the things which are in the world. If any
man love the world, the love of God is not in him: for everything that
is in the world is the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and
the pride of life, which is not of the Father but of the world. And the
world perisheth and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God
abideth forever.” <span id="fr_2258"></span>[2259](#fn_2258) The saints
therefore scorn all those things on which the world exists, but it is
impossible for them never to be carried away to them by a brief
aberration of thoughts, and even now no man, except our Lord and
Saviour, can keep his naturally wandering mind always fixed on the
contemplation of God so as never to be carried away from it through the
love of something in this world; as Scripture says: “Even the stars are
not clean in His sight,” and again: “If He puts no trust in His saints,
and findeth iniquity in His angels,” or as the more correct translation
has it: “Behold among His saints none is unchangeable, and the heavens
are not pure in His sight.” <span id="fr_2259"></span>[2260](#fn_2259)
