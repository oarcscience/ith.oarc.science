#### <span id="ii.vi.i.xlix-p0.1"></span>Chapter XLIX.

<span id="ii.vi.i.xlix-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.vi.i.xlix-p1.1"></span>But</span> in Samaria, Zacharia the king,
who was very wicked, and whom we have spoken of above as occupying the
throne, was slain by a certain Sella, who seized the kingdom. He, in
turn, perished by the treachery of Mane, who simply repeated the conduct
of his predecessor. Mane held the government which he had taken from
Sella, and left it to his son Pache. But a certain person of the same
name slew Pache, and seized the kingdom. Ere long being cut off by Osee,
he lost the sovereignty by the same crime by which he had received it.
This man, being ungodly beyond all the kings who had preceded him,
brought punishment upon himself from God, and a perpetual captivity on
his nation. For Salmanasar, king of the Assyrians, made war with him,
and when conquered rendered him tributary. But when, with secret plans,
he was preparing for rebellion, and had asked the king of the
Ethiopians, who then had possession of Egypt for his assistance,
Salmanasar, on discovering that, cast him into prison with fetters never
taken off, while he destroyed the city, and carried off the whole people
into his own kingdom, Assyrians being placed in the enemy’s country to
guard it. Hence that district was called Samaria, because in the
language of the Assyrians guards are called Samaritæ. <span
id="fr_325"></span>[326](#fn_325.md) Very many of their settlers accepted
the divine rites of the Jewish religion, while others remained in the
errors of heathenism. In this war, Tobias was carried into captivity.
But on the side of the two tribes, Achaz, who was displeasing to God on
account of his impiety, finding he had frequently the worst of it in
wars with his neighbors, resolved to worship the gods of the heathen,
undoubtedly because by their help his enemies had proved victorious in
frequent battles. He ended his days with this crime <span
id="fr_326"></span>[327](#fn_326.md) in his wicked mind, after a reign of
sixteen years.
