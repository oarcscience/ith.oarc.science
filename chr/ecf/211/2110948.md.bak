#### <span id="iv.v.viii.xxviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXVIII.

<span id="iv.v.viii.xxviii-p1"></span>The answer telling in what cases
the determination is to be kept fixedly, and in what cases it may be
broken if need be.

<span id="iv.v.viii.xxviii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.viii.xxviii-p2.1"></span>Joseph</span>: We do not lay this down
with regard to those fundamental commands, without which our salvation
cannot in any way exist, but with regard to those which we can either
relax or hold fast to without endangering our state, as for instance, an
unbroken and strict fast, or total abstinence from wine or oil, or
entire prohibition to leave one’s cell, or incessant attention to
reading and meditation, all of which can be practised at pleasure,
without damage to our profession and purpose, and, if need be, can be
given up without blame. But we must most resolutely make up our minds to
observe those fundamental commands, and not even, if need arise, to
avoid death in their cause, with regard to which we must immovably
assert: “I have sworn and am purposed.” And this should be done for the
preservation of love, for which all things else should be disregarded
lest the beauty and perfection of its calm should suffer a stain. In the
same way we must swear for the purity of our chastity, and we ought to
do the same for faith, and sobriety and justice, to all of which we must
cling with unchangeable persistence, and to forsake which even for a
little is worthy of blame. But in the case of those bodily exercises,
which are said to be profitable for a little, <span
id="fr_2066"></span>[2067](#fn_2066.md) we must, as we said, decide in such
a way that, if there occurs any more decided opportunity for a good act,
which would lead us to relax them, we need not be bound by any rule
about them, but may give them up and freely adopt what is more useful.
For in the case of those bodily exercises, if they are dropped for a
time, there is no danger: but to have given up these others even for a
moment is deadly.
