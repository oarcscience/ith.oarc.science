#### <span id="iv.v.vi.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.

<span id="iv.v.vi.iv-p1"></span>Of the miracle which Abbot Abraham
wrought on the breasts of a woman.

<span id="iv.v.vi.iv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.vi.iv-p2.1"></span>Why</span> also need I mention the acts of
Abbot Abraham, <span id="fr_1948"></span>[1949](#fn_1948.md) who was
surnamed <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.v.vi.iv-p3.1"></span>ἁ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.v.vi.iv-p3.2"></span>πλοῦς</span>, i.e., the simple, from the
simplicity of his life and his innocence. This man when he had gone from
the desert to Egypt for the harvest in the season of Quinquagesima <span
id="fr_1949"></span>[1950](#fn_1949.md) was pestered with tears and prayers
by a woman who brought her little child, already pining away and half
dead from lack of milk; he gave her a cup of water to drink signed with
the sign of the cross; and when she had drunk it at once most
marvellously her breasts that had been till then utterly dry flowed with
a copious abundance of milk.
