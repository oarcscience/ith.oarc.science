<span id="iv.iii.ii.xiv-p1"></span>Of the way in which they devote
themselves in their cells equally to manual labour and to prayer.

<span id="iv.iii.ii.xiv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.ii.xiv-p2.1"></span>And</span> therefore they supplement
their prayer by the addition of labour, lest slumber might steal upon
them as idlers. For as they scarcely enjoy any time of leisure, so there
is no limit put to their spiritual meditations. For practising equally
the virtues of the body and of the soul, they balance what is due to the
outer by what is profitable to the inner man; <span
id="fr_706"></span>[707](#fn_706.md) steadying the slippery motions of the
heart and the shifting fluctuations of the thoughts by the weight of
*labour*, like some strong and immoveable anchor, by which the
changeableness and wanderings of the heart, fastened within the barriers
of the cell, may be shut up in some perfectly secure harbour, and so,
intent only on spiritual meditation and watchfulness over the thoughts,
may not only forbid the watchful mind to give a hasty consent to any
evil suggestions, but may also keep it safe from any unnecessary and
idle thoughts: so that it is not easy to say which depends on the
other—I mean, whether they practise their incessant manual labour for
the sake of spiritual meditation, or whether it is for the sake of their
continuous labours that they acquire such remarkable spiritual
proficiency and light of knowledge.

any one who does otherwise is subject.](2110312.md)
