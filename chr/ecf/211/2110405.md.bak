#### <span id="iv.iii.v.xxxii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXII.

<span id="iv.iii.v.xxxii-p1"></span>Of the letters which were burnt
without being read.

<span id="iv.iii.v.xxxii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.v.xxxii-p2.1"></span>Nor</span> do I think it less needful to
relate this act of a brother who was intent on purity of heart, and
extremely anxious with regard to the contemplation of things divine.
When after an interval of fifteen years a large number of letters had
been brought to him from his father and mother and many friends in the
province of Pontus, he received the huge packet of letters, and turning
over the matter in his own mind for some time, “What thoughts,” said he,
“will the reading of these suggest to me, which will incite me either to
senseless joy or to useless sadness! for how many days will they draw
off the attention of my heart from the contemplation I have set before
me, by the recollection of those who wrote them! How long will it take
for the disturbance of mind thus created to be calmed, and what an <span
id="page_245">p. 245</span> <span
id="iv.iii.v.xxxii-Page_245"></span>effort will it cost for that former
state of peacefulness to be restored, if the mind is once moved by the
sympathy of the letters, and by recalling the words and looks of those
whom it has left for so long begins once more in thought and spirit to
revisit them, to dwell among them and to be with them. And it will be of
no use to have forsaken them in the body, if one begins to look on them
with the heart, and readmits and revives that memory which on renouncing
this world every one gave up, as if he were dead.” Turning this over in
his mind, he determined not only not to read a single letter, but not
even to open the packet, for fear lest, at the sight of the names of the
writers, or on recalling their appearance, the purpose of his spirit
might give way. And so he threw it into the fire to be burnt, all tied
up just as he had received it, crying, “Away, O ye thoughts of my home,
be ye burnt up, and try no further to recall me to those things from
which I have fled.”
