#### <span id="iv.iii.iv.xliii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XLIII.

<span id="iv.iii.iv.xliii-p1"></span>Recapitulation of the explanation
how a monk can mount up towards perfection.

<span id="iv.iii.iv.xliii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.iv.xliii-p2.1"></span>And</span> in order that all these
things which have been set forth in a somewhat lengthy discourse may be
more easily stamped on your heart and may stick in your thoughts with
all tenacity, I will make a summary of them so that you may be able to
learn all the changes by heart by reason of their brevity and
conciseness. Hear then in few words how you can mount up to the heights
of perfection without an effort or difficulty. “The beginning” of our
salvation and “of wisdom” is, according to Scripture, “the fear of the
Lord.” <span id="fr_817"></span>[818](#fn_817) From the fear of the Lord
arises salutary compunction. From compunction of heart springs
renunciation, i.e. nakedness and contempt of all possessions. From
nakedness is begotten humility; from humility the mortification of
desires. Through mortification of desires all faults are extirpated and
decay. By driving out faults virtues shoot up and increase. By the
budding of virtues purity of heart is gained. By purity of heart the
perfection of apostolic love is acquired.
