#### <span id="iv.iv.ii.xv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XV.

<span id="iv.iv.ii.xv-p1"></span>How we must meditate on God.

<span id="iv.iv.ii.xv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.ii.xv-p2.1"></span>But</span> the contemplation of God is
gained in a variety of ways. For we not only discover God by admiring
His incomprehensible essence, a thing which still lies hid in the hope
of the promise, but we see Him through the greatness of His creation,
and the consideration of His justice, and the aid of His daily
providence: when with pure minds we contemplate what He has done with
His saints in every generation, when with trembling heart we admire His
power with which He governs, directs, and rules all things, or the
vastness of His knowledge, and that eye of His from which no secrets of
the heart can lie hid, when we consider the sand of the sea, and the
number of the waves measured by Him and known to Him, when in our wonder
we think that the drops of rain, the days and hours of the ages, and all
things past and future are present to His knowledge; when we gaze in
unbounded admiration on that ineffable mercy of His, which with
unwearied patience endures countless sins which are <span
id="page_303">p. 303</span> <span id="iv.iv.ii.xv-Page_303"></span>every
moment being committed under His very eyes, or the call with which from
no antecedent merits of ours, but by the free grace of His pity He
receives us; or again the numberless opportunities of salvation which He
grants to those whom He is going to adopt—that He made us be born in
such a way as that from our very cradles His grace and the knowledge of
His law might be given to us, that He Himself, overcoming our enemy in
us simply for the pleasure of His good will, rewards us with eternal
bliss and everlasting rewards, when lastly He undertook the dispensation
of His Incarnation for our salvation, and extended the marvels of His
sacraments <span id="fr_1128"></span>[1129](#fn_1128.md) to all nations.
But there are numberless other considerations of this sort, which arise
in our minds according to the character of our life and the purity of
our heart, by which God is either seen by pure eyes or embraced: which
considerations certainly no one will preserve lastingly, if anything of
carnal affections still survives in him, because “thou canst not,” saith
the Lord, “see My face: for no man shall see Me and live;” <span
id="fr_1129"></span>[1130](#fn_1129.md) viz., to this world and to earthly
affections.
