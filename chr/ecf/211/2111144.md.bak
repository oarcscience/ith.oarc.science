#### <span id="iv.vii.vi.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.

<span id="iv.vii.vi.ix-p1"></span>Since those marvellous works which
from the days of Moses were shown to the children of Israel are
attributed to Christ, it follows that He must have existed long before
His birth in time.

<span id="iv.vii.vi.ix-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.vi.ix-p2.1"></span>And</span> when the Apostle wanted to make
this clear and patent to everybody he spoke as follows, saying that,
“Jesus having saved the people out of the land of Egypt afterward
destroyed them that believed not.” <span
id="fr_2519"></span>[2520](#fn_2519.md) But elsewhere too we read: “Neither
let us tempt Christ, as some <span id="page_587">p. 587</span> <span
id="iv.vii.vi.ix-Page_587"></span>of them tempted, and were destroyed by
serpents.” <span id="fr_2520"></span>[2521](#fn_2520.md) Peter also the
chief of the apostles says: “And now why tempt ye God to put a yoke upon
the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we have been
able to bear. But we believe that we shall be saved by the grace of our
Lord Jesus Christ even as they were.” <span
id="fr_2521"></span>[2522](#fn_2521.md) We know most certainly that the
people of God were delivered from Egypt, and led dryshod through mighty
tracts of water, and preserved in the vast desert wastes, by none but
God alone; as it is written: “The Lord alone did lead them, and there
was no strange God among them.” <span
id="fr_2522"></span>[2523](#fn_2522.md) And how can an Apostle declare in
so many and such clear passages that the people of the Jews were
delivered from Egypt by *Jesus*, and that *Christ* was at that time
tempted by the Jews in the wilderness, saying, “Neither let us tempt
Christ, as some of them tempted, and were destroyed of the serpents?”
And further the blessed Apostle Peter says of all the saints who lived
under the law of the Old Covenant that they were saved by the grace of
our Lord Jesus Christ. Get out then, and wriggle out of this if you
can—whoever you are—you who rage with vapid mouth and a spirit of
blasphemy, and think that there is no difference at all between Adam and
Christ; and you who deny that He was God before His birth of the Virgin,
show clearly how you can prove that He was not God before His body came
into existence. For lo, an Apostle says that the people were saved out
of the land of Egypt by Jesus: and that Christ was tempted by
unbelievers in the wilderness: and that our fathers, i.e., the
patriarchs and prophets, were saved by the grace of our Lord Jesus
Christ. Deny it if you can. I shall not be surprised if you manage to
deny what we all read, as you have already denied what we all believe.
Know then that even then it was Christ in God who led the people out of
Egypt, and it was Christ in God who was tempted by the people who
tempted, and it was Christ in God who saved all the righteous men by His
lavish grace: for through the oneness of the mystery (of the
Incarnation) the terms God and Christ so pass into each other, that
whatever God did, that we may say that Christ did; and whatever
afterwards Christ bore, we may say that God bore. And so when the
prophet said, “There shall no new God be in thee, neither shalt thou
worship any other God,” <span id="fr_2523"></span>[2524](#fn_2523.md) he
announced it with the same meaning and in the same spirit as that with
which the Apostle said that Christ was the leader of the people of
Israel out of Egypt; to show that He who was born of the Virgin as man,
was even through the unity of the mystery still in God. Otherwise,
unless we believe this, we must either believe with the heretics that
Christ is not God, or against the teaching of the prophet hold that He
is a new God. But may it be far from the Catholic people of God, to seem
either to differ from the prophet or to agree with heretics: or
perchance the people who should be blessed may be involved in a curse,
and be charged with putting their hope in man. For whoever declares that
the Lord Jesus Christ was at His birth a mere man, is doubly liable to
the curse, whether he believes in Him or not. For if he believes,
“Cursed is he who puts his hope in man.” <span
id="fr_2524"></span>[2525](#fn_2524.md) But if he does not believe,
nonetheless is he still cursed, because though not believing in man, he
still has altogether denied God.
