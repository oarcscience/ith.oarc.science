#### <span id="iv.vi.v.xi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XI.

<span id="iv.vi.v.xi-p1"></span>An inquiry why in Egypt they do not fast
during all the fifty days (of Easter) nor bend their knees in prayer.

<span id="iv.vi.v.xi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.v.xi-p2.1"></span>But</span> it is now time to follow out the
plan of the promised discourse. So then when Abbot Theonas had come to
visit us in our cell during Eastertide <span
id="fr_2184"></span>[2185](#fn_2184.md) after Evensong was over we sat for
a little while on the ground and began diligently to consider why they
were so very careful that no one should during the whole fifty days
either bend his knees in prayer <span
id="fr_2185"></span>[2186](#fn_2185.md) or venture to fast till the ninth
hour, and we made our inquiry the more earnestly because we had never
seen this custom so carefully observed in the monasteries of Syria.

<span id="iv.vi.v.xi-p4"></span> The 20th Canon of the Council of Nicæa
(<span class="sc"><span id="iv.vi.v.xi-p4.1"></span>a.d.</span> 325)
alludes to diversities of custom with regard to posture for prayer on
Sundays and from Easter to Pentecost, and ordered that for the future
prayer should be made standing at these times. Cassian’s language in the
text would seem to show that in his day the Canon in question, though
kept in Egypt, was not strictly observed in Palestine but that the
ancient diversity of customs still to some extent prevailed.
