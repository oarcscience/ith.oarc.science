#### <span id="iv.vi.viii.xxii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXII.

<span id="iv.vi.viii.xxii-p1"></span>A question how we ought to
understand what the gospel says “My yoke is easy and My burden is
light.”

<span id="iv.vi.viii.xxii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.viii.xxii-p2.1"></span>Germanus</span>: As you have given us a
remedy for all delusions, and by God’s grace all the wiles of the devil
by which we were harassed, have been exposed by your teaching, we beg
that you will also explain to us this that is said in the gospel: “My
yoke is easy, and My burden is light.” <span
id="fr_2323"></span>[2324](#fn_2323.md) For it seems tolerably opposed to
that saying of the prophet where it is said: “For the sake of the words
of Thy lips I kept hard ways;” while even the Apostle says: “All who
will live godly in Christ suffer persecutions.” <span
id="fr_2324"></span>[2325](#fn_2324.md) But whatever is hard and fraught
with persecutions cannot be easy and light.
