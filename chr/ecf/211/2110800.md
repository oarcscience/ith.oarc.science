#### <span id="iv.iv.x.xxx-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXX.

<span id="iv.iv.x.xxx-p1"></span>How tears ought not to be squeezed out,
when they do not flow spontaneously.

<span id="iv.iv.x.xxx-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.x.xxx-p2.1"></span>From</span> these tears those are vastly
different which are squeezed out from dry eyes while the heart is hard:
and although we cannot believe that these are altogether fruitless (for
the attempt to shed them is made with a good intention, especially by
those who have not yet been able to attain to perfect knowledge or to be
thoroughly cleansed from the stains of past or present sins), yet
certainly the flow of tears ought not to be thus forced out by those who
have already advanced to the love of virtue, nor should the weeping of
the outward man be with great labour attempted, as even if it is
produced it will never attain the rich copiousness of spontaneous tears.
For it will rather <span id="page_398">p. 398</span> <span
id="iv.iv.x.xxx-Page_398"></span>cast down the soul of the suppliant by
his endeavours, and humiliate him, and plunge him in human affairs and
draw him away from the celestial heights, wherein the awed mind of one
who prays should be steadfastly fixed, and will force it to relax its
hold on its prayers and grow sick from barren and forced tears.
