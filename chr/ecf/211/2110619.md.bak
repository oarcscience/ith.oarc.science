#### <span id="iv.iv.iv.i-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.i-p1"></span>Of the life and conduct of Abbot
Paphnutius.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.i-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.iv.i-p2.1"></span>In</span> that choir of saints who shine
like brilliant stars in the night of this world, we have seen the holy
Paphnutius, <span id="fr_1198"></span>[1199](#fn_1198.md) like some great
luminary, shining with the brightness of knowledge. For he was a
presbyter of our company, I mean of those whose abode was in the desert
of Scete, where he lived to extreme old age, without ever moving from
his cell, of which he had taken possession when still young, and which
was five miles from the church, even to nearer districts; nor was he
when worn out with years hindered by the distance from going to Church
on Saturday or Sunday. But not wanting to return from thence empty
handed he would lay on his shoulders a bucket of water to last him all
the week, and carry it back to his cell, and even when he was past
ninety would not suffer it to be fetched by the labour of younger men.
He then from his earliest youth threw himself into the monastic
discipline with such fervour that when he had spent only a short time in
it, he was endowed with the virtue of submission, as well as the
knowledge of all good qualities. For by the practice of humility and
obedience he mortified all his desires, and by this stamped out all his
faults and acquired every virtue which the monastic system and the
teaching of the ancient fathers produces, and, inflamed with desire for
still further advances, he was eager to penetrate into the recesses of
the desert, so that, with no human companions to disturb him, he might
be more readily united to the Lord, to whom he longed to be inseparably
joined, even while he still lived in the society of the brethren. And
there once more in his excessive fervour he outstripped the virtues of
the Anchorites, and in his eager desire for continual divine meditation
avoided the sight of them: and he plunged into solitary places yet
wilder and more inaccessible, and hid himself for a long while in them,
so that, as the Anchorites themselves only with great difficulty caught
a glimpse of him every now and then, the belief was that he enjoyed and
delighted in the daily society of angels, and because of this remarkable
characteristic of his <span id="fr_1199"></span>[1200](#fn_1199.md) he was
surnamed by them the Buffalo.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.i-p3"></span> Paphnutius. The name is not uncommon in
the annals of the fourth century: (1) A Deacon who bore it suffered in
the persecution of Diocletian; and (2) a Bishop of the same name, who
had been a confessor, was mainly instrumental in preventing the rule of
celibacy being forced on the clergy by the Council of Nicæa; (3) another
was a prominent member of the Meletian schism; while (4) a fourth was
present, as Bishop of Sais in Lower Egypt at the Council of Alexandria
in 362; and (5) the life of a fifth is given by Palladius (Hist. Laus.
lxii.–lxv.) and Rufinus (Hist. Monach. c. xvi.). The one whom Cassian
here mentions, surnamed the Buffalo, is apparently a different person
from the last mentioned. Further details of his history are given in the
Institutes IV. c. xxx. xxxi., and in Conference X. ii., iii. Cassian
tells the interesting story of his share in the Anthropomorphite
controversy, and the beneficial influence which he then exercised.
