#### <span id="ii.v.ii.xvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVI.

<span id="ii.v.ii.xvi-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.ii.xvi-p1.1"></span>Take</span> heed that ye love not human
glory in any respect, lest your portion also be reckoned among those to
whom it was said, “How <span id="fr_217"></span>[218](#fn_217.md) can ye
believe, who seek glory, one from another?” <span id="page_66">p.
66</span> <span id="ii.v.ii.xvi-Page_66"></span>and of whom it is said
through the prophet, “Increase <span id="fr_218"></span>[219](#fn_218.md)
evils to them; increase evils to the boastful of the earth”; and
elsewhere, “Ye are confounded <span id="fr_219"></span>[220](#fn_219.md)
from your boasting, from your reproaching in the sight of the Lord.” For
I do not wish you to have regard to those, who are virgins of the world,
and not of Christ; who unmindful of their purpose and profession,
rejoice in delicacies, are delighted with riches, and boast of their
descent from a merely carnal nobility; who, if they assuredly believed
themselves to be the daughters of God, would never, after their divine
ancestry, admire mere human nobility, nor glory in any honored earthly
father: if they felt that they had God as their Father, they would not
love any nobility connected with the flesh. Why, thou foolish woman,
dost thou flatter thyself about the nobleness of thy descent, and take
delight in it? God, at the beginning, created two human beings, from
whom the whole multitude of the human race has descended; and thus it is
not the equity of nature, but the ambition of evil desire, which has
given rise to worldly nobility. Unquestionably, we are all rendered
equal by the grace of the divine <span id="fr_220"></span>[221](#fn_220.md)
bath, and there can be no difference among those, whom the second birth
has generated, by means of which alike the rich man and the poor man,
the free man and the slave, the nobly born and the lowly born, is
rendered a son of God. Thus mere earthly rank is overshadowed by the
brilliance of heavenly glory, and henceforth is taken no account of,
while those who formerly had been unequal in worldly honors are now
equally arrayed in the glory of a heavenly and divine nobility. There is
now among such no place for lowness of birth; nor is any one inferior to
another whom the majesty of the divine birth adorns; except in the
estimation of those who do not think that the things of heaven are to be
preferred to those of earth. There can be no worldly boasting among
them, if they reflect how vain a thing it is that they should, in
smaller matters, prefer themselves to those whom they know to be equal
to themselves in greater matters, and should regard, as placed below
themselves on earth, those whom they believe to be equal to themselves
in what relates to heaven. But do thou, who art a virgin of Christ, and
not of the world, flee from all the glory of this present life, that
thou mayest attain to the glory which is promised in the world to come.
