If then pride of heart alone was enough to cast down from heaven to earth a power that was so great and adorned with the attributes of such might, the very greatness of his fall shows us with what care we who are surrounded by the weakness of the flesh ought to be on our guard. But we can learn how to avoid the most deadly poison of this evil if we trace out the origin and causes of his fall. For weakness can never be cured, nor the remedies for bad states of health be disclosed  <A NAME="page_281"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 281</FONT></A> <a name="iv.iii.xii.iv-Page_281"></A>unless first their origin and causes are investigated by a wise scrutiny. For as he (viz., Lucifer) was endowed with divine splendour, and shone forth among the other higher powers by the bounty of his Maker, he believed that he had acquired the splendour of that wisdom and the beauty of those powers, with which he was graced by the gift of the Creator, by the might of his own nature, and not by the beneficence of His generosity. And on this account he was puffed up as if he stood in no need of divine assistance in order to continue in this state of purity, and esteemed himself to be like God, as if, like God, he had no need of any one, and trusting in the power of his own will, fancied that through it he could richly supply himself with everything which was necessary for the consummation of virtue or for the perpetuation of perfect bliss. This thought alone was the cause of his first fall. On account of which being forsaken by God, whom he fancied he no longer needed, he suddenly became unstable and tottering, and discovered the weakness of his own nature, and lost the blessedness which he had enjoyed by God&#146;s gift. And because he &#8220;loved the words of ruin,&#8221; with which he had said, &#8220;I will ascend into heaven,&#8221; and the &#8220;deceitful tongue,&#8221; with which he had said of himself, &#8220;I will be like the Most High,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1017"></A><A HREF="#fn_1017"><FONT SIZE="1">1018</FONT></A>
 and of Adam and Eve, &#8220;Ye shall be as gods,&#8221; therefore &#8220;shall God destroy him forever and pluck him out and remove him from his dwelling place and his root out of the land of the living.&#8221; Then &#8220;the just,&#8221; when they see his ruin, &#8220;shall fear, and shall laugh at him and say&#8221; (what may also be most justly aimed at those who trust that they can obtain the highest good without the protection and assistance of God): &#8220;Behold the man that made not God his helper, but trusted in the abundance of his riches, and prevailed in his vanity.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1018"></A><A HREF="#fn_1018"><FONT SIZE="1">1019</FONT></A>
