#### <span id="iv.iii.iv.xxvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXVI.

<span id="iv.iii.iv.xxvi-p1"></span>How Abbot John obeyed his senior by
trying to roll a huge stone, which a large number of men were unable to
move.

<span id="iv.iii.iv.xxvi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.iv.xxvi-p2.1"></span>Again</span>, when some others were
anxious to be edified by the example of his obedience, the elder called
him and said: “John, run and roll that stone hither as quickly as
possible;” and he forthwith, applying now his neck, and now his whole
body, tried with all his might and main to roll an enormous stone which
a great crowd of men would not be able to move, so that not only were
his clothes saturated with sweat from his limbs, but the stone itself
was wetted by his neck; in this too never weighing the impossibility of
the command and deed, out of reverence for the old man and the unfeigned
simplicity of his service, as he believed implicitly that the old man
could not command him to do anything vain or without reason.

Patermucius, which he did not hesitate to make perfect by throwing his
little boy into the river at the command of his senior.](2110356.md)
