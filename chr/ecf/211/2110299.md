#### <span id="iv.iii.ii.ii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.

<span id="iv.iii.ii.ii-p1"></span>Of the difference of the number of
Psalms appointed to be sung in all the provinces.

<span id="iv.iii.ii.ii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.ii.ii-p2.1"></span>For</span> we have found that many in
different countries, according to the fancy of their mind (having,
indeed, as the Apostle says, “a zeal, for God but not according to
knowledge” <span id="fr_673"></span>[674](#fn_673) .md), have made for
themselves different rules and arrangements in this matter. For some
have appointed that each night twenty or thirty Psalms should be said,
and that these should be prolonged by the music of antiphonal
singing <span id="fr_674"></span>[675](#fn_674.md) , and by the addition of
some modulations as well. Others have even tried to go beyond this
number. Some use eighteen. And in this way we have found different rules
appointed in different places, and the system and regulations that we
have seen are almost as many in number as the monasteries and cells
which we have visited. There are some, too, to whom it has seemed good
that in the day offices of prayer, viz., Tierce, Sext, and Nones, <span
id="fr_675"></span>[676](#fn_675.md) the number of Psalms and prayers
should be made to correspond exactly to the number of the hours at which
the services are offered up to the Lord. <span
id="fr_676"></span>[677](#fn_676.md) Some have thought fit that six Psalms
should be assigned to each service of the day. And so I think it best to
set forth the most ancient system of the fathers which is still observed
by the servants of God throughout the whole of Egypt, so that your new
monastery in its untrained infancy in Christ <span
id="fr_677"></span>[678](#fn_677.md) may be instructed in the most ancient
institutions of the earliest fathers.

<span id="iv.iii.ii.ii-p4"></span> *Antiphona*. In this passage the word
appears to mean the actual Psalms sung antiphonally, rather than what is
generally meant in later writings by the term. Cf. the Rule of Aurelian,
“Dicite matutinarios, i.e., primo canticum in antiphona, deinde
directaneum, judica me Deus…in antiphona dicite hymnum, splendor patudæ
gloriæ.” And see the use of the word later on by Cassian himself, c.
vii.

<span id="iv.iii.ii.ii-p5"></span> The third, sixth, and ninth hours
were observed as hours of prayer from the earliest days. Cf. Tertullian
De Oratione, c. 25; Clem. Alex. Stromata, VII., c. 7, § 40.

<span id="iv.iii.ii.ii-p6"></span> I.e., that at Tierce there should be
three Psalms, at Sext six, and at Nones nine.
