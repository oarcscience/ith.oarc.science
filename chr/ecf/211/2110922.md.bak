#### <span id="iv.v.viii.ii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.

<span id="iv.v.viii.ii-p1"></span>Of the anxiety of Abbot Germanus at
the recollection of our promise.

<span id="iv.v.viii.ii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.viii.ii-p2.1"></span>What</span> are we doing? said he. For we
see that we are involved in a great difficulty and are in an evil
plight, as reason itself and the life of the saints is effectually
teaching us what is the best thing for our progress in the spiritual
life, and yet our promise given to the Elders does not allow us to
choose what is helpful. For we might, by the examples of such great men,
be formed for a more perfect life and aim, were it not that the terms of
our promise compelled us to return at once to the monastery. But if we
return thither, we shall never get another chance of coming here again.
But if we stay here and choose to carry out our wishes, what becomes of
the faith of the oath which we are aware that we gave to our Elders
promising a speedy return; that we might be allowed to make a hasty
round of the monasteries and saints of this province? And when in this
state of tumult we could not make up our minds what we ought to decide
on the state of our salvation we simply testified by our groans the hard
fate of our condition, upbraiding the audacity of our impudence, and yet
hating the shame which was natural to us, weighed down by which we could
not in any other way resist the prayers of those who kept us back
against our profit and purpose, except by the promise of a speedy
return, as we wept indeed that we laboured under the fault of that
shame, of which it is said “There is a shame that bringeth sin.” <span
