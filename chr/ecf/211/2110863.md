#### <span id="iv.v.v.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.

<span id="iv.v.v.iii-p1"></span>How practical perfection depends on a
double system.

<span id="iv.v.v.iii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.v.iii-p2.1"></span>But</span> this practical perfection depends
on a double system; for its first method is to know the nature of all
faults and the manner of their cure. Its second, to discover the order
of the virtues, and form our mind by their perfection so that it may be
obedient to them, not as if it were forced and subject to some fierce
sway, but as if it delighted in its natural good, and throve upon it,
and mounted by that steep and narrow way with real pleasure. For in what
way will one, who has neither succeeded in understanding the nature of
his own faults, nor tried to eradicate them, be able to gain an
understanding of virtues, which is the second stage of practical
training, or the mysteries of spiritual and heavenly things, which exist
in the higher stage of theoretical knowledge? For it will necessarily be
maintained that he <span id="page_436">p. 436</span> <span
id="iv.v.v.iii-Page_436"></span>cannot advance to more lofty heights who
has not surmounted the lower ones, and much less will he be able to
grasp those things that are without, who has not succeeded in
understanding what is within his comprehension. But you should know that
we must make an effort with a twofold purpose in our exertion; both for
the expulsion of vice, and for the attainment of virtue. And this we do
not gather from our own conjecture, but are taught by the words of Him
who alone knows the strength and method of His work: “Behold,” He says:
“I have set thee this day over the nations and over kingdoms, to root
up, and to pull down, and to waste, and to destroy, and to build and to
plant.” <span id="fr_1866"></span>[1867](#fn_1866.md) He points out that
for getting rid of noxious things four things are requisite; viz., to
root up, to pull down, to waste, and to destroy: but for the performance
of what is good, and the acquisition of what pertains to righteousness
only to build and to plant. Whence it is perfectly evident that it is a
harder thing to tear up and eradicate the inveterate passions of body
and soul than to introduce and plant spiritual virtues.
