#### <span id="iv.iii.x.xx-p0.1"></span>Chapter XX.

<span id="iv.iii.x.xx-p1"></span>Of a lazy brother who tried to persuade
others to leave the monastery.

<span id="iv.iii.x.xx-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.x.xx-p2.1"></span>We</span> know a brother, whose name we
would give if it would do any good, who, although he was remaining in
the monastery and compelled to deliver to the steward his fixed task
daily, yet for fear lest he might be led on to some larger portion of
work, or put to shame by the example of one labouring more zealously,
when he had seen some brother admitted into the monastery, who in the
ardour of his faith wanted to make up the sale of a larger piece of
work, if he found that he could not by secret persuasion check him from
carrying out his purpose, he would by bad advice and whisperings
persuade him to depart thence. And in order to get rid of him more
easily he would pretend that he also had already been for many reasons
offended, and wanted to leave, if only he could find a companion and
support for the journey. And when by secretly running down the monastery
he had wheedled him into consenting, and arranged with him the time at
which to leave the monastery, and the place to which he should go
before, and where he should wait for him, he himself, pretending that he
would follow, stopped where he was. And when the other out of shame for
his flight did not dare to return again to the monastery from which he
had run away, the miserable author of his flight stopped behind in the
monastery. It will be enough to have given this single instance of this
sort of men in order to put beginners on their guard, and to show
clearly what evils idleness, as Scripture says, <span
id="fr_982"></span>[983](#fn_982.md) can produce in the mind of a monk, and
how “evil communications corrupt good manners.” <span
