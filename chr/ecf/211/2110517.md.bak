#### <span id="iv.iii.xi.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.

<span id="iv.iii.xi.vi-p1"></span>That vainglory is not altogether got
rid of by the advantages of solitude.

<span id="iv.iii.xi.vi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.xi.vi-p2.1"></span>In</span> solitude also it does not cease
from pursuing him who has for the sake of glory fled from intercourse
with all men. And the more thoroughly a man has shunned the whole world,
so much the more keenly does it pursue him. It tries to lift up with
pride one man because of his great endurance of work and labour, another
because of his extreme readiness to obey, another because he outstrips
other men in humility. One man is tempted through the extent of his
knowledge, another through the extent of his reading, another through
the length of his vigils. Nor does this malady endeavour to wound a man
except through his virtues; introducing hindrances which lead to death
by means of those very things through which the supplies of life are
sought. For when men are anxious to walk in the path of holiness and
perfection, the enemies do not lay their snares to deceive them anywhere
except in the way along which they walk, in accordance with that saying
of the blessed David: “In the way wherein I walked have they laid a
snare for me;” <span id="fr_1006"></span>[1007](#fn_1006.md) that in this
very way of virtue along which we are walking, when pressing on to “the
prize of our high calling,” <span id="fr_1007"></span>[1008](#fn_1007.md)
we may be elated by our successes, and so sink down, and fall with the
feet of our soul entangled and caught in the snares of vainglory. And so
it results that those of us who could not be vanquished in the conflict
with the foe are overcome by the very greatness of our triumph, or else
(which is another kind of deception) that, overstraining the limits of
that self-restraint which is possible to us, we fail of perseverance in
our course on account of bodily weakness.
