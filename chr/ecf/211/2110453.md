#### <span id="iv.iii.viii.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.

<span id="iv.iii.viii.v-p1"></span>How calm a monk ought to be.

<span id="iv.iii.viii.v-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.viii.v-p2.1"></span>And</span> so a monk aiming at
perfection, and desiring to strive lawfully in his spiritual combat,
should be free from all sin of anger and wrath, and should listen to the
charge which the “chosen vessel” gives him. “Let all anger,” says he,
“and wrath, and clamour, and evil speaking, be taken away from among
you, with all malice.” <span id="fr_926"></span>[927](#fn_926) When he
says, “Let all anger be taken away from you,” he excepts none whatever
as necessary or useful for us. And if need be, he should at once treat
an erring brother in such a way that, while he manages to apply a remedy
to one afflicted with perhaps a slight fever, he may not by his wrath
involve himself in a more dangerous malady of blindness. For he who
wants to heal another’s wound ought to be in good health and free from
every affection of weakness himself, lest that saying of the gospel
should be used to him, “Physician, first heal thyself;” <span
id="fr_927"></span>[928](#fn_927) and lest, seeing a mote in his
brother’s eye, he see not the beam in his own eye, for how will he see
to cast out the mote from his brother’s eye, who has the beam of anger
in his own eye? <span id="fr_928"></span>[929](#fn_928)
