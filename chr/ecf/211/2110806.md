#### <span id="iv.iv.x.xxxvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXVI.

<span id="iv.iv.x.xxxvi-p1"></span>Of the value of short and silent
prayer.

<span id="iv.iv.x.xxxvi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.x.xxxvi-p2.1"></span>Wherefore</span> we ought to pray often
but briefly, lest if we are long about it our crafty foe may succeed in
implanting something in our heart. For that is the true sacrifice, as
“the sacrifice of God is a broken spirit.” This is the salutary
offering, these are pure drink offerings, that is the “sacrifice of
righteousness,” the “sacrifice of praise,” these are true and fat
victims, “holocausts full of marrow,” which are offered by contrite and
humble hearts, and which those who practise this control and fervour of
spirit, of which we have spoken, with effectual power can sing: “Let my
prayer be set forth in Thy sight as the incense: let the lifting up of
my hands be an evening sacrifice.” <span
id="fr_1658"></span>[1659](#fn_1658.md) But the approach of the right hour
and of night warns us that we ought with fitting devotion to do this
very thing, of which, as our slender ability allowed, we seem to have
propounded a great deal, and to have prolonged our conference
considerably, though we believe that we have discoursed very little when
the magnificence and difficulty of the subject are taken into account.

<span id="iv.iv.x.xxxvi-p4"></span>With these words of the holy Isaac we
were dazzled rather than satisfied, and after evening service had been
held, rested our limbs for a short time, and intending at the first dawn
again to return under promise of a fuller discussion departed, rejoicing
over the acquisition of these precepts as well as over the assurance of
his promises. Since we felt that though the excellence of prayer had
been shown to us, still we had not yet understood from his discourse its
nature, and the power by which continuance in it might be gained and
kept.
