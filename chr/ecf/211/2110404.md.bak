#### <span id="iv.iii.v.xxxi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXI.

<span id="iv.iii.v.xxxi-p1"></span>The same old man’s rebuke when he saw
how the brethren went to sleep during the spiritual conferences, and
woke up when some idle story was told.

<span id="iv.iii.v.xxxi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.v.xxxi-p2.1"></span>The</span> same old man made clear by
this proof that it was the devil who encouraged idle tales, and showed
himself always as the enemy of spiritual conferences. For when he was
discoursing to some of the brethren on necessary matters and spiritual
things, and saw that they were weighed down with a sound slumber, and
could not drive away the weight of sleep from their eyes, he suddenly
introduced an idle tale. And when he saw that at once they woke up,
delighted with it, and pricked up their ears, he groaned and said, “Up
till now we were speaking of celestial things and all your eyes were
overpowered with a sound slumber; but as soon as an idle tale was
introduced, we all woke up and shook off the drowsiness of sleep which
had overcome us. And from this therefore consider who is the enemy of
that spiritual conference, and who has shown himself the suggester of
that useless and carnal talk. For it is most evidently shown that it is
he who, rejoicing in evil, never ceases to encourage the latter and to
oppose the former.”
