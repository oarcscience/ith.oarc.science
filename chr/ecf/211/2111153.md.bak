#### <span id="iv.vii.vii.ii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.

<span id="iv.vii.vii.ii-p1"></span>The author adapts the mystery of the
number seven (made up of the five loaves and two fishes) to his own
work.

<span id="iv.vii.vii.ii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.vii.ii-p2.1"></span>Meanwhile</span> as we have alluded to
the five loaves, I think it will not be out of place to make a
comparison of the five books which we have already composed. For as they
are equal in number, so they are not dissimilar in character. For as the
loaves were of barley, so these books may (as far as my ability is
concerned) be fairly termed “of barley,” although they are enriched with
passages from Holy Scripture, and contain life-giving treasures in
contemptible surroundings. And even in this point they are not unlike
those loaves, for though they were poor things to look at, yet they
proved to be rich in blessing: and so these books, though, as far as my
powers are concerned, they are worthless, yet they are valuable from the
sacred matter which is mingled with them: and though they appear
outwardly worthless like barley owing to my words, yet within they have
the savour of the bread of life owing to the testimonies from the Lord
Himself. It remains that, after His example, they may, by the gift of
Divine grace, furnish life-giving food from countless seeds. And as
those loaves supplied bodily strength to those who ate them, so may
these give spiritual vigour to those who read them. But as then the
Lord, from whom this gift comes as did that, by means of that food
provided that they might be filled and so should not faint by the way,
so now is He able to bring it about that by means of this men may be
filled and not err (from the faith). But still because there, where a
countless host of God’s people was fed with a mighty gift, though there
was very little for them to eat, we read that to those five loaves there
were added two fishes, it is fitting that we too, who are anxious to
give to all God’s people who are following, the nourishment of a
spiritual repast, should add to those five books corresponding to the
five loaves, two more books corresponding to the two fishes: praying and
beseeching Thee, O Lord, that Thou wilt look on our efforts and prayers,
and grant a prosperous issue to our pious undertaking. And since we, out
of our love and obedience, desire to make the number of our books
correspond to the number of loaves and fishes, do Thou grant the virtue
of Thy Benediction upon them; and, as Thou dost bless <span
id="fr_2545"></span>[2546](#fn_2545.md) this little work of ours with a
gospel number, so mayest Thou fill up the number with the fruit of the
gospel, and grant that this may be for holy and saving food to all the
people of Thy Church, of every age and sex. And if there are some who
are affected by the deadly breath of that poisonous serpent, and in an
unhealthy state of soul and spirit have caught a pestilential disease in
their feeble dispositions, give to them all the vigour of health, and
entire soundness of faith, that by granting to them all, by means of
these writings of ours, the saving care of Thy gift—just as <span
id="page_592">p. 592</span> <span
id="iv.vii.vii.ii-Page_592"></span>that food in the gospel was
completely sanctified by Thee, so that by eating it those hungry souls
were strengthened,—so mayest Thou bid languid souls to be healed by
these.
