#### <span id="ii.iv.i.xi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XI.

<span id="ii.iv.i.xi-p1"></span>“<span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.i.xi-p1.1"></span>When</span> the monk whom I have mentioned
heard of this,—when he learned both that the children had encountered
danger through meeting the snake, and that moreover, having got the
better of the serpent, they had received a sound beating,—he implored
the Abbot that henceforth no bread or food of any kind should be sent to
him. And now the eighth day had passed since that man of Christ had
exposed himself to the danger of perishing from hunger; his limbs were
growing dry with fasting, but his mind fixed upon heaven could not fail;
his body was wearing away with abstinence, but his faith remained firm.
In the meantime, the Abbot was admonished by the Spirit to visit that
disciple. Under the influence of a pious solicitude, he was eager to
learn by what means of preserving life that faithful man was supported,
since he had declined any human aid in ministering to his necessities.
Accordingly, he sets out in person to satisfy himself on the subject.
When the recluse saw from a distance the old man coming to him, he ran
to meet him: he thanks him for the visit, and conducts him to his cell.
As they enter the cell together, they behold a basket of palm branches,
full of hot bread, hanging fixed at the door-post. And first the smell
of the hot bread is perceived; but on touching it, it appears as if just
a little before it had been taken from the oven. At the same time, they
do not recognize the bread as being of the shape common in Egypt. Both
are filled with amazement, and acknowledge the gift as being from
heaven. On the one side, the recluse declared that this event was due to
the arrival of the Abbot; while, on the other side, the Abbot ascribed
it rather to the faith and virtue of the recluse; but both broke the
heaven-sent bread with exceeding joy. And when, on his return to the
monastery, the old man reported to the brethren what had occurred, such
enthusiasm seized the minds of all of them, that they vied with each
other in their haste to betake themselves to the desert, and its sacred
seclusion; while they declared themselves miserable in having made their
abode only too long amid a multitude, where human fellowship had to be
carried on and endured.
