#### <span id="iv.v.vi.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.

<span id="iv.v.vi.ix-p1"></span>How uprightness of life is of more
importance than the working of miracles.

<span id="iv.v.vi.ix-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.vi.ix-p2.1"></span>And</span> of those cures it was said to the
blessed Apostles: “Rejoice not that the devils are subject to
you.” <span id="fr_1958"></span>[1959](#fn_1958.md) For this was wrought
not by their own power, but by the might of the name invoked. And
therefore they are warned not to presume to claim for themselves any
blessedness or glory on this account as it was done simply by the power
and might of God, but only on account of the inward purity of their life
and heart, for which it was vouchsafed to them to have their names
written in heaven.
