#### <span id="iv.iii.xi.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.

<span id="iv.iii.xi.iii-p1"></span>How many forms and shapes vainglory
takes.

<span id="iv.iii.xi.iii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.xi.iii-p2.1"></span>For</span> our other faults and passions
may be said to be simpler and of but one form: but this takes many forms
and shapes, and changes about and assails the man who stands up against
it from every quarter, and assaults its conqueror on all sides. For it
tries to injure the soldier of Christ in his dress, in his manner, his
walk, his voice, his work, his vigils, his fasts, his prayers, when he
withdraws, when he reads, in his knowledge, his silence, his obedience,
his humility, his patience; and like some most dangerous rock hidden by
surging waves, it causes an unforeseen and miserable shipwreck to those
who are sailing with a fair breeze, while they are not on the lookout
for it or guarding against it.
