#### <span id="ii.v.ii.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.

<span id="ii.v.ii.v-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.ii.v-p1.1"></span>Now</span>, there are three kinds of virtue,
by means of which the possession of the kingdom of heaven is secured.
The first is chastity, the second, contempt of the world, and the third,
righteousness, which, as when joined together, they very greatly benefit
their possessors, so, when separated, they can hardly be of any
advantage, since every one of them is required, not for its own sake
only, but for the sake of another. First of all, then, chastity is
demanded, <span id="page_60">p. 60</span> <span
id="ii.v.ii.v-Page_60"></span>that contempt of the world may more easily
follow, because the world can be more easily despised by those who are
not held fast in the bonds of matrimony. Contempt of the world, again,
is required, in order that righteousness may be maintained, which those
can with difficulty fully preserve who are involved in desires after
worldly advantages, and in the pursuit of mundane pleasures. Whosoever,
therefore, possesses the first kind of virtue, chastity, but does not,
at the same time, have the second, which is contempt of the world,
possesses the first almost to no purpose, since he does not have the
second, for the sake of which the first was required. And if any one
possesses the first and second, but is destitute of the third which is
righteousness, he labors in vain, since the former two are principally
required for the sake of the third. For what profits it to possess
chastity in order to contempt of the world, and yet not to have that on
account of which you have the other? Or why should you despise the
things of the world, if you do not observe righteousness, for the sake
of which it is fitting that you should possess chastity, as well as
contempt for the world? For as the first kind of virtue is on account of
the second, and the second on account of the third, so the first and the
second are on account of the third; and if it does not exist, neither
the first nor the second will prove of any advantage.
