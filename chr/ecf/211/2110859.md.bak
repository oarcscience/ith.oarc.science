#### <span id="iv.v.iv.xviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.

<span id="iv.v.iv.xviii-p1"></span>The decision of the fathers that free
will is not equal to save a man.

<span id="iv.v.iv.xviii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.iv.xviii-p2.1"></span>And</span> from this it is clearly
gathered by those who, led not by chattering words but by experience,
measure the magnitude of grace, and the paltry limits of man’s will,
that “the race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong, nor
food to the wise, nor riches to the prudent, nor grace to the learned,”
but that “all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing
to every man severally as He will.” <span
id="fr_1861"></span>[1862](#fn_1861.md) And therefore it is proved by no
doubtful faith but by experience which can (so to speak) be laid hold
of, that God the Father of all things worketh indifferently all things
in all, as the Apostle says, like some most kind father and most benign
physician; and that now He puts into us the very beginnings of
salvation, and gives to each the zeal of his free will; and now grants
the carrying out of the work, and the perfecting of goodness; and now
saves men, even against their will and without their knowledge, from
ruin that is close at hand, and a headlong fall; and now affords them
occasions and opportunities of salvation, and wards off headlong and
violent attacks from purposes that would bring death; and assists some
who are already willing and running, while He draws others who are
unwilling and resisting, and forces them to a good will. But that, when
we do not always resist or remain persistently unwilling, everything is
granted to us by God, and that the main share in our salvation is to be
ascribed not to the merit of our own works but to heavenly grace, we are
thus taught by the words of the Lord Himself: “And you shall remember
your ways and all your wicked doings with which you have been defiled;
and you shall be displeased with yourselves in your own sight for all
your wicked deeds which you have committed. And you shall know that I am
the Lord, when I shall have done well by you for My own name’s sake, not
according to your evil ways, nor according to your wicked deeds, O house
of Israel.” <span id="fr_1862"></span>[1863](#fn_1862.md) And therefore it
is laid down by all the Catholic fathers who have taught perfection of
heart not by empty disputes of words, but in deed and act, that the
first stage in the Divine gift is for each man to be inflamed with the
desire of everything that is good, but in such a way that the choice of
free will is open to either side: and that the second stage in Divine
grace is for the aforesaid practices of virtue to be able to be
performed, but in such a way that the possibilities of the will are not
destroyed: the third stage also belongs to the gifts of God, so that it
may be held by the persistence of the goodness already acquired, and in
such a way that the liberty may not be surrendered and experience
bondage. For the God of all must be held to work in all, so as to
incite, protect, and strengthen, but not to take away the freedom of the
will which He Himself has once given. If however any more subtle <span
id="page_435">p. 435</span> <span
id="iv.v.iv.xviii-Page_435"></span>inference of man’s argumentation and
reasoning seems opposed to this interpretation, it should be avoided
rather than brought forward to the destruction of the faith (for we gain
not faith from understanding, but understanding from faith, as it is
written: “Except ye believe, ye will not understand” <span
id="fr_1863"></span>[1864](#fn_1863) .md) for how God works all things in
us and yet everything can be ascribed to free will, cannot be fully
grasped by the mind and reason of man.

<span id="iv.v.iv.xviii-p6"></span>Strengthened by this food the blessed
Chæremon prevented us from feeling the toil of so difficult a journey.
