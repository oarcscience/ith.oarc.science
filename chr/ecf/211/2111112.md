#### <span id="iv.vii.iv.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VIII.

<span id="iv.vii.iv.viii-p1"></span>When confessing the Divinity of
Christ we ought not to pass over in silence the confession of the cross.

<span id="iv.vii.iv.viii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.iv.viii-p2.1"></span>But</span> let us see what else follows.
In writing to the church of Corinth, he whom we spoke of above, the
instructor of all the churches viz. Paul, speaks thus: “The Jews,” says
he, “seek signs, and the Greeks ask for wisdom. But we preach Christ
crucified, to the Jews a stumbling-block, to the Gentiles foolishness:
but to them that are saved, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of
God and the wisdom of God.” <span id="fr_2436"></span>[2437](#fn_2436) O
most powerful teacher of the faith, who even in this passage, when
teaching the Church thought it not enough to speak of Christ as God
without adding that He was crucified on purpose that for the sake of the
open and solid teaching of the faith he might proclaim Him, whom he
called the crucified, to be the wisdom of God. He then employed no
subtilty or circumlocution, nor did he when he preached the gospel of
the Lord blush at the mention of the cross of Christ. And though it was
a stumbling-block to the Jews, and foolishness to the Gentiles to hear
of God as born, God in bodily form, God suffering, God crucified, yet he
did not weaken the force of his pious utterance because of the
wickedness of the offence of the Jews: nor did he lessen the vigour of
his faith because of the unbelief and the foolishness of others: but
openly, persistently, and boldly proclaimed that He, whom a mother <span
id="fr_2437"></span>[2438](#fn_2437) had borne, whom men had slain, the
spear had pierced, the cross had stretched—was “the power and wisdom of
God, to the Jews a stumbling-block, and to the Gentiles foolishness.”
But still that which was to some a stumbling-block and foolishness, was
to others the power and wisdom of God. For as the persons differed, so
was there a difference of their thoughts: and what a man who was void of
sound understanding, and incapable of true good, foolishly denied in
unbelief, that a wise faith could feel in its inmost soul to be holy and
life giving.
