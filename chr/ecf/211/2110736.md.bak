mentioned as living in this desert, although he was also a remarkable
and striking man, yet, in order to punish a single word, to which in a
dispute with Abbot Macarius, <span id="fr_1494"></span>[1495](#fn_1494.md)
he had given utterance somewhat too sharply, as he was anticipated in
some opinion, he was instantly delivered to so dreadful a demon that he
filled his mouth with filth <span id="fr_1495"></span>[1496](#fn_1495.md)
which he supplied, and the Lord showed by the quickness of his cure, and
the author of his healing, that He had brought this scourge upon him to
purify him, that there might not remain in him any stain from his
momentary error: for as soon as Abbot Macarius committed himself to
prayer, quicker than a word the evil spirit fled away from him and
departed.
