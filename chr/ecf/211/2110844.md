#### <span id="iv.v.iv.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.

<span id="iv.v.iv.iii-p1"></span>The answer that without God’s help not
only perfect chastity but all good of every kind cannot be performed.

<span id="iv.v.iv.iii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.iv.iii-p2.1"></span>Chæremon</span>: By this very instance
which you bring forward we can still more clearly prove that the
exertions of the worker can do nothing without God’s aid. For neither
can the husbandman, when he has spent the utmost pains in cultivating
the ground, forthwith ascribe the produce of the crops and the rich
fruits to his own exertions, as he finds that these are often in vain
unless opportune rains and a quiet and calm winter aids them, so that we
have often seen fruits already ripe and set and thoroughly matured
snatched as it were from the hands of those who were grasping them; and
their continuous and earnest efforts were of no use to the workers
because they were not under the guidance of the Lord’s assistance. As
then the Divine goodness does not grant these rich crops to idle
husbandmen who do not till their fields by frequent ploughing, so also
toil all night long is of no use to the workers unless the mercy of the
Lord prospers it. But herein human pride should never try to put itself
on a level with the grace of God or to intermingle itself with it, so as
to fancy that its own efforts were the cause of Divine bounty, or to
boast that a very plentiful crop of fruits was an answer to the merits
of its own exertions. For a man should consider and with a most careful
scrutiny weigh the fact that he could not by his own strength apply
those very efforts which he has earnestly used in his desire for wealth,
unless the Lord’s protection and pity had given him strength for the
performance of all agricultural labours; and that his own will and
strength would have been powerless unless Divine compassion had supplied
the means for the completion of them, as they sometimes fail either from
too much or from too little rain. For when vigour has been granted by
the Lord to the oxen, and bodily health and the power to do all the
work, and prosperity in undertakings, still a man must pray lest there
come to him, as Scripture says, “a heaven of brass and an earth of
iron,” and “the cankerworm eat what the locust hath left, and the
palmerworm eat what the cankerworm hath left, and the mildew destroys
what the palmerworm hath left.” <span
id="fr_1746"></span>[1747](#fn_1746.md) Nor is it only in this that the
efforts of the husbandman in his work need God’s help, unless it also
averts unlooked for accidents by which, even when the field is rich with
the expected fruitful crops, not only is the man deprived of what he has
vainly hoped and looked for, but actually loses the abundant fruits
which he has already gathered and stored up in the threshing floor or in
the barn. From which we clearly infer that the initiative not only of
our actions but also of good thoughts comes from God, who inspires us
with a good will to begin with, and supplies us with the opportunity of
carrying out what we rightly desire: for “every good gift and every
perfect gift cometh down from above, from the Father of lights,” <span
id="fr_1747"></span>[1748](#fn_1747.md) who both begins what is good, and
continues it and completes it in us, as the Apostle says: “But He who
giveth seed to the sower will both provide bread to eat and will
multiply your seed and make the fruits of your righteousness to
increase.” <span id="fr_1748"></span>[1749](#fn_1748.md) But it is for us,
humbly to follow day by day the grace of God which is drawing us, or
else if we resist with “a stiff neck,” and (to use the words of
Scripture) “uncircumcised ears,” <span
id="fr_1749"></span>[1750](#fn_1749.md) we shall deserve to hear the words
of Jeremiah: “Shall he that falleth, not rise again? and he that is
turned away, shall he not turn again? Why then is this people in
Jerusalem turned away with a stubborn revolting? They have stiffened
their necks and refused to return.” <span
id="fr_1750"></span>[1751](#fn_1750.md)
