<span id="ii.v.i.vi"></span>

#### <span id="ii.v.i.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.

<span id="ii.v.i.vi-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.i.vi-p1.1"></span>After</span> these, and several others who
have discharged for us the duties of instruction, the Son of God himself
will speak thus: “I, certainly, exalted on a lofty seat, holding heaven
in my hand, and the earth in my fist, extended within and without, in
the inside of all things which are produced, and on the outside of
all <span id="fr_156"></span>[157](#fn_156.md) things that move,
inconceivable, infinite in the power <span
id="fr_157"></span>[158](#fn_157.md) of nature, invisible to sight,
inaccessible to touch, in order that I might exist as the least of you
(for the purpose of subduing the hardness of your heart and for
softening your faithlessness by sound doctrines), condescended to be
born in flesh, and, having laid aside the glory of God, I assumed the
form of a servant, so that, sharing with you in bodily infirmity, I
might in turn bring you to a participation in my glory, through
obedience to the precept of salvation. I restored health to the sick and
infirm, hearing to the deaf, sight to the blind, the power of speech to
the dumb, and the use of their feet to the lame; that I might influence
you, by heavenly signs, all the more easily to believe in me, and in
those things which I had announced, I promised you the kingdom of
heaven; I also, in order that you might have an example of escape from
punishment, placed in Paradise the robber who acknowledged me almost at
the moment of his death, that ye might follow even the faith of him who
had been thought worthy of having his sins forgiven him. And that by my
example in your behalf, ye yourselves also might be able to suffer; I
suffered for you, that no man might hesitate to suffer for himself what
God <span id="fr_158"></span>[159](#fn_158.md) had endured for man. I
showed myself after my resurrection, in order that your faith might not
be overthrown. I admonished the Jews in the person of Peter; I preached
to the Gentiles in the person of Paul; and I do not regret doing so, for
good results followed. The good have understood my work; the faithful
have perfected it; the righteous have completed it; the merciful have
consummated it: there have been a large number of martyrs, and a large
number of saints. Those to whom I thus refer were undoubtedly in the
same body and in the same world as you. Why, then, do I find no good
work in you, ye descendants of vipers? Ye have shown no repentance for
your wicked deeds, even at the very end of your earthly course. And what
does it profit that ye honor me with your lips, when you deny me by your
deeds and works? Where are now your riches, where your honors, where
your powers, and where your pleasures? I pronounce no new sentence over
you: you simply incur the judgment which I formerly predicted.”

id="ii.v.i.vi-p1.2"></span>

<span id="ii.v.i.vi-p2"></span> The divine omnipresence is here denoted.

<span id="fn_157"></span>[57:158](2110106.htm#fr_157.md) <span
id="ii.v.i.vi-p2.1"></span>

<span id="ii.v.i.vi-p3"></span> Or, according to another punctuation,
“inconceivable in nature, infinite in power.”

<span id="fn_158"></span>[57:159](2110106.htm#fr_158.md) <span
id="ii.v.i.vi-p3.1"></span>

<span id="ii.v.i.vi-p4"></span> Clericus thinks this expression
unscriptural, and fitted to support heresy. But it may be justified by
such a passage as [Acts xx. 28](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#028.md)<span
id="ii.v.i.vi-p4.1"></span>, if <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.v.i.vi-p4.2"></span>θεοῦ</span> can be accepted as the correct
reading, which is now generally agreed upon.
