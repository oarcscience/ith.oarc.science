#### <span id="iv.iii.iv.xxxviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXVIII.

<span id="iv.iii.iv.xxxviii-p1"></span>Of the renunciant’s preparation
against temptation, and of the few who are worthy of imitation.

<span id="iv.iii.iv.xxxviii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.iv.xxxviii-p2.1"></span>Wherefore</span>, as Scripture says,
“when you go forth to serve the Lord stand in the fear of the Lord, and
prepare your mind” <span id="fr_806"></span>[807](#fn_806) not for
repose or carelessness or delights, but for temptations and troubles.
For “through much tribulation we must enter into the kingdom of God.”
For “strait is the gate and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life,
and <span id="page_232">p. 232</span> <span
id="iv.iii.iv.xxxviii-Page_232"></span>few there be which find
it.” <span id="fr_807"></span>[808](#fn_807) Consider therefore that you
belong to the few and elect; and do not grow cold after the examples of
the lukewarmness of many: but live as the few, that with the few you may
be worthy of a place in the kingdom of God: for “many are called, but
few chosen,” and it is a “little flock to which it is the Father’s good
pleasure to give” <span id="fr_808"></span>[809](#fn_808) an
inheritance. You should therefore realize that it is no light sin for
one who has made profession of perfection to follow after what is
imperfect. And to this state of perfection you may attain by the
following steps and in the following way.
