#### <span id="iv.vii.viii.xxii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXII.

<span id="iv.vii.viii.xxii-p1"></span>That the raising up of Christ into
heaven is not to be ascribed to the Spirit alone.

<span id="iv.vii.viii.xxii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.viii.xxii-p2.1"></span>But</span> you add this also to those
impieties of yours mentioned above; viz., that the Spirit granted to the
Lord His ascension into heaven: showing by this blasphemous notion of
yours that you believe that the Lord Jesus Christ was so weak and
powerless that had not the Spirit raised Him up to heaven, you fancy
that He would still at this day have been on earth. But to prove this
assertion you bring forward a passage of Scripture: for you say “Giving
commands to the apostles whom He had chosen, by the Holy Ghost He was
raised up.” <span id="fr_2652"></span>[2653](#fn_2652) What am I to call
you? What am I to think of you who by corrupting the sacred writings
contrive that their evidences should not have the force of evidences? A
new kind of audacity, which strives by its impious arguments to manage
that truth may seem to confirm falsehood. For the Acts of the Apostles
does not say what you make out. For what says the Scripture? “What Jesus
began to do and to teach until the day in which giving charge to the
apostles whom He had chosen by the Holy Ghost, He was taken up.” Which
is an instance of Hyperbaton, and must be understood in this way: what
Jesus began to do and to teach until the day in which he was taken up,
giving charge to the apostles whom He had chosen by the Holy Ghost; so
that we ought not perhaps to have to give you any further answer in this
matter than that of the passage itself, for the entire passage ought to
be sufficient for the full truth, if the mutilation of it was available
for your falsehood. But still, you, who think that our Lord Jesus Christ
could not have ascended into heaven, unless He had been raised up by the
Spirit; tell me how is it that He Himself says “No one hath ascended
into heaven but He who came down from heaven, even the Son of man who is
in heaven”? <span id="fr_2653"></span>[2654](#fn_2653) Confess then how
foolish and absurd your notion is that He could not ascend into heaven,
who is said, although He had descended into earth, never to have been
absent from heaven: and say whether to leave the regions below and
ascend into heaven was possible for Him to whom it was easy when still
on earth, ever to continue in heaven. But what is that which He Himself
says: “I ascend unto my Father.” <span
id="fr_2654"></span>[2655](#fn_2654) Did He imply that in this ascension
there would be the intervention of Another’s help, who by the very fact
that He said He would ascend, shows the efficacy of His own power? David
also says of the Ascension of the Lord: “God ascended with a merry
noise, the Lord with the sound of the trumpet:” <span
id="fr_2655"></span>[2656](#fn_2655) He clearly explained the glory of
Him who ascends by the power of the ascension.
