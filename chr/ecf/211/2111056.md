#### <span id="iv.vi.vii.xviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.

<span id="iv.vi.vii.xviii-p1"></span>That even good and holy men are not
without sin.

<span id="iv.vi.vii.xviii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.vii.xviii-p2.1"></span>But</span> that no one however holy is
in this life free from trespasses and sin, we are told also by the
teaching of the Saviour, who gave His disciples the form of the perfect
prayer and among those other sublime and sacred commands, which as they
were only given to the saints and perfect cannot apply to the wicked and
unbelievers, He bade this to be inserted: “And forgive us our debts as
we also forgive our debtors.” <span id="fr_2286"></span>[2287](#fn_2286)
If then this is offered as a true prayer and by saints, as we ought
without the shadow of a doubt to believe, who can be found so obstinate
and impudent, so puffed up with the pride of the devil’s own rage, as to
maintain that he is without sin, and not only to think himself greater
than apostles, but also to charge the Saviour Himself with ignorance or
folly, as if He either did not know that some men could be free from
debts, or was idly teaching those whom He knew to stand in no need of
the remedy of that prayer? But since all the saints who altogether keep
the commands of their King, say every day “Forgive us our debts,” if
they speak the truth there is indeed no one free from sin, but if they
speak falsely, it is equally true that they are not free from the sin of
falsehood. Wherefore also that most wise Ecclesiastes reviewing in his
mind all the actions and purposes of men declares without any exception:
“that there is not a righteous man upon earth, that doeth good and
sinneth not,” <span id="fr_2287"></span>[2288](#fn_2287) i.e., no one
ever could or ever will be found on this earth so holy, so diligent, so
earnest as to be able continually to cling to that true and unique good,
and not day after day to feel that he is drawn aside from it and fails.
But still though he maintains that he cannot be free from wrong doing,
yet none the less we must not deny that he is righteous.
