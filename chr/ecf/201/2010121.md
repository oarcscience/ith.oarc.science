and to the whole Roman people, I , Justin, son of Priscus and grandson
of Bacchius, <span id="fr_1100"></span>[1101](#fn_1100.md) of Flavia
Neapolis in Palestine, Syria, present this address and petition in
behalf of those men of every nation who are unjustly hated and
persecuted, I myself being one of them.” And the same emperor having
learned also from other brethren in Asia of the injuries of all kinds
which they were suffering from the inhabitants of the province, thought
it proper to address the following ordinance to the Common
Assembly <span id="fr_1101"></span>[1102](#fn_1101.md) of Asia.

id="iii.ix.xii-p2.2"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.xii-p3"></span> On the titles of the Emperor Antoninus
Pius, see Otto’s notes in his edition of Justin’s works (*Corpus Apol.
Christianorum*, Vol. I. p. 2. sq.).

<span id="fn_1098"></span>[185:1099](2010121.htm#fr_1098.md) <span
id="iii.ix.xii-p3.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.xii-p4"></span> That is, Marcus Aurelius, whose
original name was Marcus Annius Verus, but who, after his adoption by
the Emperor Antoninus Pius, was styled Marcus Ælius Aurelius Verus
Cæsar. As a tribute to his sincerity and truthfulness, he was quite
commonly called, instead of *Verus*, *Verissimus*.

<span id="fn_1099"></span>[185:1100](2010121.htm#fr_1099.md) <span
id="iii.ix.xii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.xii-p5"></span> The <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.ix.xii-p5.1"></span>mss</span>. are divided here between the
forms φιλοσόφω and φιλοσόφου. If the former reading be followed, we must
translate, “to Lucius, own son of Cæsar the philosopher.” The <span
class="c13"><span id="iii.ix.xii-p5.2"></span>mss</span>. are about
equally divided, and the latter reading is adopted by Stephanus,
Valesius, Stroth, and Burton. But our <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.ix.xii-p5.3"></span>mss</span>. of Justin support the former
reading, which is adopted by Schwegler and Heinichen, and which, as the
latter remarks, is far more natural than the other reading, for Justin
had greater reason for giving the appellation of “philosopher” to a
Cæsar who was still living, even though he may not have been noted for
his philosophical tastes, than to a Cæsar who was already dead, and
whose character certainly entitled him to the appellation no more than,
if as much as, his son. See Heinichen’s note *in loco*, and Otto’s note
in his edition of Justin’s works, Vol. I. p. 3. ff. The Lucius addressed
here was Lucius Ceionius Commodus, whose father, bearing the same name,
had been adopted as Cæsar by Hadrian. The younger Lucius was adopted as
Cæsar along with Marcus by Antoninus Pius, and later became Marcus’
colleague in the empire, when he added to his own name the name Verus,
which Marcus had formerly borne. He is therefore commonly known in
history as Lucius Verus (see the respective articles in Smith’s *Dict.
of Greek and Roman Biog*.).

<span id="iii.ix.xii-p6"></span> Of Justin’s father and grandfather we
know nothing except their names. On the place of his birth, see above,
chap. 11, note 20.

<span id="iii.ix.xii-p7"></span> This “Assembly of Asia” (τὸ κοινὸν τῆς
᾽Ασίας) was one of the regular provincial diets which Augustus had
called into being as fixed institutions. It was an annual assembly of
the civic deputies of the province, and served as a general organ of the
province, especially in bringing the wishes of the people to the
knowledge of the governor, and through him to the emperor, and decrees
of the emperor were often addressed to it, and legates chosen by it were
sent to the emperor whenever occasion required. See Marquardt, *Röm.
Staatsverwaltung*, I. p. 366. sq.
