<span id="iv.vi.i.vii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII</span>.—*Comparison with Cyrus,
King of the Persians, and with Alexander of Macedon.*

<span id="iv.vi.i.vii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.vii-p2.1"></span>Ancient</span> history describes Cyrus,
king of the Persians, as by far the most illustrious of all kings up to
his time. And yet if we regard the end of his days, <span
id="fr_3064"></span>[3065](#fn_3064.md) we find it but little corresponded
with his past prosperity, since he met with an inglorious and
dishonorable death at the hands of a woman. <span
id="fr_3065"></span>[3066](#fn_3065.md)

<span id="iv.vi.i.vii-p5"></span>Again, the sons of Greece celebrate
Alexander the Macedonian as the conqueror of many and diverse nations;
yet we find that he was removed by an early death, before he had reached
maturity, being carried off by the effects of revelry and
drunkenness. <span id="fr_3066"></span>[3067](#fn_3066.md) His whole life
embraced but the space of thirty-two years, and his reign extended to no
more than a third part of that period. Unsparing as the thunderbolt, he
advanced through streams of blood and reduced entire nations and cities,
young and old, to utter slavery. But when he had scarcely arrived at the
maturity of life, and was lamenting the loss of youthful pleasures,
death fell upon him with terrible stroke, and, that he might not longer
outrage the human race, cut him off in a foreign and hostile land,
childless, without successor, and homeless. His kingdom too was
instantly dismembered, each of his officers taking away and
appropriating a portion for himself. And yet this man is extolled for
such deeds as these. <span id="fr_3067"></span>[3068](#fn_3067.md)

<span id="iv.vi.i.vii-p3"></span> \[Such seems to be the probable
meaning of this passage, which is manifestly corrupt, and of which
various emendations have been proposed.—*Bag.*\] Perhaps better
paraphrased, “But since the test of blessedness lies not in this, but in
his end, we look and find that this.” The key to the idea is found in
the remark near the end of chapter 11. Cf. also note.

<span id="fn_3065"></span>[483:3066](2010392.htm#fr_3065.md) <span
id="iv.vi.i.vii-p3.1"></span>

<span id="iv.vi.i.vii-p4"></span> This is the account of Diodorus, who
says he was taken prisoner and crucified by the queen of the “Scythians”
(3. 11, ed. 1531, f. 80b). Herodotus says that he was slain in battle,
but his head cut off afterwards and dipped in a sack of blood by the
queen Tomyris, who had rejected his suit, the death of whose son he had
caused, and who had sworn to “give him his fill of blood” (Herod. Bk. I,
§§205–214). Xenophon says he died quietly in bed (*Cyrop.* 8. 7).

<span id="fn_3066"></span>[483:3067](2010392.htm#fr_3066.md) <span
id="iv.vi.i.vii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iv.vi.i.vii-p6"></span> A malarial fever, but made fatal by
drinking at a banquet (cf. Plut. chaps. 75 and 76, Arrian, Bk. 7).

<span id="fn_3067"></span>[483:3068](2010392.htm#fr_3067.md) <span
id="iv.vi.i.vii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="iv.vi.i.vii-p7"></span> Eusebius’ rhetorical purpose makes him
unfair to Alexander, who certainly in comparison with others of his time
brought relative blessing to the conquered (cf. Smith, *Dict.* I, p.
122).
