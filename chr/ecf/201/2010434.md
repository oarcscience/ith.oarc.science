oppressed the East.*

<span id="iv.vi.i.xlix-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.xlix-p2.1"></span>For</span> he was informed that in that
quarter a certain savage beast was besetting both the church of God and
the other inhabitants of the provinces, owing, as it were, to the
efforts of the evil spirit to produce effects quite contrary to the
deeds of the pious emperor: so that the Roman empire, divided into two
parts, seemed to all men to resemble night and day; since darkness
overspread the provinces of the East, while the brightest day illumined
the inhabitants of the other portion. And whereas the latter were
receiving manifold blessings at the hand of God, the sight of these
blessings proved intolerable to that envy which hates all good, as well
as to the tyrant who afflicted the other division of the empire; and
who, notwithstanding that his government was prospering, and he had been
honored by a marriage connection <span

Constantine, yet cared not to follow the steps of that pious prince, but
strove rather to imitate the evil purposes and practice of the impious;
and chose to adopt the course of those whose ignominious end he had seen
with his own eyes, rather than to maintain amicable relations with him
who was his superior. <span id="fr_3149"></span>[3150](#fn_3149.md)
