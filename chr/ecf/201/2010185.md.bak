for the deeper study of divine things, and for the investigation and
interpretation of the Sacred Scriptures, and also for the instruction of
those who came to him,—for coming, one after another, from morning till

Heraclas, who was a zealous student of divine things, and in other
respects a very learned man, not ignorant of philosophy, and made him
his associate in the work of instruction. He entrusted to him the
elementary training of beginners, but reserved for himself the teaching
of those who were farther advanced.
