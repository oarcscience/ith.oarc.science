<span id="iii.iii.i.ix-p1"></span> §9. *The Death of Eusebius.*

<span id="iii.iii.i.ix-p2"></span>In less than two years after the
celebration of his *tricennalia*, on May 22, 337 <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.iii.i.ix-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span>, the great Constantine
breathed his last, in Nicomedia, his former Capital. Eusebius, already
an old man, produced a lasting testimonial of his own unbounded
affection and admiration for the first Christian emperor, in his *Life
of Constantine*. Soon afterward he followed his imperial friend at the
<span id="page_26">p. 26</span> <span
id="iii.iii.i.ix-Page_26"></span>advanced age of nearly, if not quite,
eighty years. The exact date of his death is unknown, but it can be
fixed approximately. We know from Sozomen (*H. E*. III. 5) that in the
summer of 341, when a council was held at Antioch (on the date of the
Council, which we are able to fix with great exactness, see Hefele,
*Conciliengesch*. I. p. 502 sq.) Acacius, Eusebius’ successor, was
already bishop of Cæsarea. Socrates (*H. E*. II. 4) and Sozomen (*H. E*.
III. 2) both mention the death of Eusebius and place it shortly before
the death of Constantine the younger, which took place early in 340 (see
Tillemont’s *Hist. des Emp*. IV. p. 327 sq.), and after the intrigues
had begun which resulted in Athanasius’ second banishment. We are thus
led to place Eusebius’ death late in the year 339, or early in the year
340 (cf. Lightfoot’s article, p. 318).
