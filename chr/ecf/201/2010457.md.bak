<span id="iv.vi.ii.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII</span>.—*How Constantine,
after praying in his Tabernacle, obtained the Victory.*

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.xii-p2.1"></span>But</span> while Licinius, giving himself
up to these impieties, rushed blindly towards the gulf of destruction,
the emperor on the other hand, when he saw that he must meet his enemies
in a second battle, devoted the intervening time to his Saviour. He
pitched the tabernacle of the cross <span
id="fr_3172"></span>[3173](#fn_3172.md) outside and at a distance from his
camp, and there passed his time in a pure and holy manner, offering up
prayers to God; following thus the example of his ancient prophet, of
whom the sacred oracles testify, that he pitched the tabernacle without
the camp. <span id="fr_3173"></span>[3174](#fn_3173.md) He was attended
only by a few, whose faith and pious devotion he highly esteemed. And
this custom he continued to observe whenever he meditated an engagement
with the enemy. For he was deliberate in his measures, the better to
insure safety, and desired in everything to be directed by divine
counsel. And making earnest supplications to God, he was always honored
after a little with a manifestation of his presence. And then, as if
moved by a divine impulse, he would rush from the tabernacle, and
suddenly give orders to his army to move at once without delay, and on
the instant to draw their swords. On this they would immediately
commence the attack, fight vigorously, so as with incredible celerity to
secure the victory, and raise trophies of victory over their enemies.
