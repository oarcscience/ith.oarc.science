<span id="iii.iii.i.vi-p1"></span> §6. *The Council of Nicæa*.

<span id="iii.iii.i.vi-p2"></span>At the Council of Nicæa, which met
pursuant to an imperial summons in the year 325 <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.iii.i.vi-p2.1"></span>A.D</span>., Eusebius played a very
prominent part. A description of the opening scenes of the Council is
given in his *Vita Constantini*, III. 10 sq. After the Emperor had
entered in pomp and had taken his seat, a bishop who sat next to him
upon his right arose and delivered in his honor the opening oration, to
which the Emperor replied in a brief Latin address. There can be no
doubt that this bishop was our Eusebius. Sozomen (*H. E.* I. 19) states
it directly; and Eusebius, although he does not name the speaker, yet
refers to him, as he had referred to the orator at the dedication of
Paulinus’ church at Tyre, in such a way as to make it clear that it was
himself; and moreover in his *Vita Constantini*, I. 1, he mentions the
fact that he had in the midst of an assembly of the servants of God
addressed an oration to the Emperor on the occasion of the latter’s
*vicennalia*, i.e. in 325 <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.iii.i.vi-p2.2"></span>a.d.</span> On the other hand, however,
Theodoret (*H. E*. I. 7) states that this opening oration was delivered
by Eustathius, bishop of Antioch; while Theodore of Mopsuestia and
Philostorgius (according to Nicetas Choniates, *Thes. de orthod. fid*.
V. 7) assign it to Alexander of Alexandria. As Lightfoot suggests, it is
possible to explain the discrepancy in the reports by <span
id="page_20">p. 20</span> <span
id="iii.iii.i.vi-Page_20"></span>supposing that Eustathius and
Alexander, the two great patriarchs, first addressed a few words to the
Emperor and that then Eusebius delivered the regular oration. This
supposition is not at all unlikely, for it would be quite proper for the
two highest ecclesiastics present to welcome the Emperor formally in
behalf of the assembled prelates, before the regular oration was
delivered by Eusebius. At the same time, the supposition that one or the
other of the two great patriarchs must have delivered the opening
address was such a natural one that it may have been adopted by
Theodoret and the other writers referred to without any historical
basis. It is in any case certain that the regular oration was delivered
by Eusebius himself (see the convincing arguments adduced by Stroth, p.
xxvii. sq.). This oration is no longer extant, but an idea of its
character may be formed from the address delivered by Eusebius at the
Emperor’s *tricennalia* (which is still extant under the title *De
laudibus Constantini*; see below, p. 43) and from the general tone of
his Life of Constantine. It was avowedly a panegyric, and undoubtedly as
fulsome as it was possible to make it, and his powers in that direction
were by no means slight.

<span id="iii.iii.i.vi-p3"></span>That Eusebius, instead of the bishop
of some more prominent church, should have been selected to deliver the
opening address, may have been in part owing to his recognized standing
as the most learned man and the most famous writer in the Church, in
part to the fact that he was not as pronounced a partisan as some of his
distinguished brethren; for instance, Alexander of Alexandria, and
Eusebius of Nicomedia; and finally in some measure to his intimate
relations with the Emperor. How and when his intimacy with the latter
grew up we do not know. As already remarked, he seems to have become
personally acquainted with him many years before, when Constantine
passed through Cæsarea in the train of Diocletian, and it may be that a
mutual friendship, which was so marked in later years, began at that
time. However that may be, Eusebius seems to have possessed special
advantages of one kind or another, enabling him to come into personal
contact with official circles, and once introduced to imperial notice,
his wide learning, sound common sense, genial temper and broad charity
would insure him the friendship of the Emperor himself, or of any other
worthy officer of state. We have no record of an intimacy between
Constantine and Eusebius before the Council of Nicæa, but many clear
intimations of it after that time. In fact, it is evident that during
the last decade at least of the Emperor’s life, few, if any, bishops
stood higher in his esteem or enjoyed a larger measure of his
confidence. Compare for instance the records of their conversations
(contained in the *Vita Constantini*, I. 28 and II. 9), of their
correspondence (*ib*. II. 46, III. 61, IV. 35 and 36), and the words of
Constantine himself (*ib*. III. 60). The marked attention paid by him to
the speeches delivered by Eusebius in his presence (*ib*. IV. 33 and 46)
is also to be noticed. Eusebius’ intimacy with the imperial family is
shown likewise in the tone of the letter which he wrote to Constantia,
the sister of Constantine and wife of Licinius, in regard to a likeness
of Christ which she had asked him to send her. The frankness and freedom
with which he remonstrates with her for what he considers mistaken zeal
on her part, reveal a degree of familiarity which could have come only
from long and cordial relations between himself and his royal
correspondent. Whatever other reasons therefore may have combined to
indicate Eusebius as the most fitting person to deliver the oration in
honor of the Emperor at the Council of Nicæa, there can be little doubt
that Constantine’s personal friendship for him had much to do with his
selection. The action of the Council on the subject of Arianism, and
Eusebius’ conduct in the matter, have already been discussed. Of the
bishops assembled at the Council, not far from three hundred in number
(the reports of eye-witnesses vary from two hundred and fifty to three
hundred and eighteen), all but two signed the Nicene creed as adopted by
the Council. These two, both of them Egyptians, were banished with Arius
to Illyria, while Eusebius of Nicomedia, and Theognis of Nicæa, who
subscribed the creed itself but refused to assent to its anathemas, were
also banished for a time, but soon yielded, and were restored to their
churches.

<span id="iii.iii.i.vi-p4"></span>Into the other purposes for which the
Nicene Council was called,—the settlement of the dispute respecting the
time of observing Easter and the healing of the Meletian schism,—it is
not neces<span id="page_21">p. 21</span> <span
id="iii.iii.i.vi-Page_21"></span>sary to enter here. We have no record
of the part which Eusebius took in these transactions. Lightfoot has
abundantly shown (p. 313 sq.) that the common supposition that Eusebius
was the author of the paschal cycle of nineteen years is false, and that
there is no reason to suppose that he had anything particular to do with
the decision of the paschal question at this Council.
