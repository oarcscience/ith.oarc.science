<span id="iii.xvii.vi"></span>

<span id="iii.xvii.vi-p1"></span> On Bk. III. chap. 32, § 6 (note 14a).

<span id="iii.xvii.vi-p2"></span>The Greek reads <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.xvii.vi-p2.1"></span>π€σης ἐκκλησίας</span>
(without the article), and so, two lines below, <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.xvii.vi-p2.2"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.xvii.vi-p2.3"></span>ν π€σῃ ἐκκλησί&
139·</span>. All the translators (with the exception of Pratten in the
*Ante-Nicene Fathers*, Vol. VIII., who reads, “the churches”) render
“the whole church,” as if reading <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xvii.vi-p2.4"></span>πᾶς</span> with the article. We have not,
it is true, enough of Hegesippus’ writings to be able to ascertain
positively his use of <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xvii.vi-p2.5"></span>πᾶς</span>, and it is possible that he
carelessly employed it indifferently with or without the article to
signify the definite “all” or “the whole.” In the absence of positive
testimony, however, that he failed to draw the proper distinction
between its use with and its use without the article, and in view of the
fact that Eusebius himself (as well as other early Fathers so far as I
am able to recall) is very consistent in making the distinction, I have
not felt at liberty in my translation to depart from a strict
grammatical interpretation of the phrases in question. Moreover, upon
second thought, it seems quite as possible that Hegesippus meant to say
“every” not “all”; for he can hardly have supposed these relatives of
the Lord to have presided literally over the whole Church, while he
might very well say that they presided each over the church in the city
in which he lived, which is all that the words necessarily imply. The
phrase just below, “in every church,” is perhaps as natural as “in the
whole church.”
