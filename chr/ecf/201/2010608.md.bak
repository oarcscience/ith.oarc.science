id="iv.vi.iv.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXII</span>.—*Of his Zeal in
Prayer, and the Honor he paid to the Feast of Easter.*

<span id="iv.vi.iv.xxii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.xxii-p2.1"></span>The</span> emperor himself, as a sharer
in the holy mysteries of our religion, would seclude himself daily at a
stated hour in the innermost chambers of his palace; and there in
solitary converse with his God, would kneel in humble supplication, and
entreat the blessings of which he stood in need. But especially at the
salutary feast of Easter, his religious diligence was redoubled; he
fulfilled as it were the duties of a hierophant with every energy of his
mind and body, and outvied all others in the zealous celebration of this
feast. He changed, too, the holy night vigil into a brightness like that
of day, by causing waxen tapers of great length to be lighted throughout
the city: besides which, torches everywhere diffused their light, so as
to impart to this mystic vigil a brilliant splendor beyond that of
day. <span id="fr_3320"></span>[3321](#fn_3320.md) As soon as day itself
returned, in imitation of our Saviour’s gracious acts, he opened a
liberal hand to his subjects of every nation, province, and people, and
lavished abundant bounties on all.
