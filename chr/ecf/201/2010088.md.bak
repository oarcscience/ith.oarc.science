id="iii.viii.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIX.—</span>*Domitian commands the
Descendants of David to be slain.*

<span id="iii.viii.xix-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.viii.xix-p2.1"></span>But</span> when this same Domitian had
commanded that the descendants of David should be slain, an ancient
tradition says <span id="fr_718"></span>[719](#fn_718.md) that some of the
heretics brought accusation against the descendants of Jude (said to
have been a brother of the Saviour according to the flesh), on the
ground that they were of the lineage of David and were related to Christ
himself. Hegesippus relates these facts in the following words.

<span id="iii.viii.xix-p3"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.viii.xix-p3.1"></span>παλαιὸς κατέχει λόγος</span>. It is
noticeable that, although Eusebius has the written authority of
Hegesippus for this account, he still speaks of it as supported by
“ancient tradition.” This is different from his ordinary custom, and
serves to make us careful in drawing conclusions as to the nature of
Eusebius’ authority for any statement from the expression used in
introducing it.
