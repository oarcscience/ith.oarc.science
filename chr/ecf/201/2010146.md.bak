<span id="iii.x.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.x.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter V.—</span>*God sent Rain from Heaven
for Marcus Aurelius Cæsar in Answer to the Prayers of our People.*

<span id="iii.x.vi-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.x.vi-p2.1"></span>It</span> is reported <span
id="fr_1415"></span>[1416](#fn_1415.md) that Marcus Aurelius Cæsar, brother
of Antoninus, <span id="fr_1416"></span>[1417](#fn_1416.md) being about to
engage in battle with the Germans and Sarmatians, was in great trouble
on account of his army suffering from thirst. <span
id="fr_1417"></span>[1418](#fn_1417.md) But the soldiers of the so-called
Melitene legion, <span id="fr_1418"></span>[1419](#fn_1418.md) through
<span id="page_220">p. 220</span> <span
id="iii.x.vi-Page_220"></span>the faith which has given strength from
that time to the present, when they were drawn up before the enemy,
kneeled on the ground, as is our custom in prayer, <span
id="fr_1419"></span>[1420](#fn_1419.md) and engaged in supplications to
God.

<span id="iii.x.vi-p9"></span>2. This was indeed a strange sight to the
enemy, but it is reported <span id="fr_1420"></span>[1421](#fn_1420.md)
that a stranger thing immediately followed. The lightning drove the
enemy to flight and destruction, but a shower refreshed the army of
those who had called on God, all of whom had been on the point of
perishing with thirst.

<span id="iii.x.vi-p11"></span>3. This story is related by non-Christian
writers who have been pleased to treat the times referred to, and it has
also been recorded by our own people. <span
id="fr_1421"></span>[1422](#fn_1421.md) By those historians who were
strangers to the faith, the marvel is mentioned, but it is not
acknowledged as an answer to our prayers. But by our own people, as
friends of the truth, the occurrence is related in a simple and artless
manner.

<span id="iii.x.vi-p13"></span>4. Among these is Apolinarius, <span
id="fr_1422"></span>[1423](#fn_1422.md) who says that from that time the
legion through whose prayers the wonder took place received from the
emperor a title appropriate to the event, being called in the language
of the Romans the Thundering Legion.

<span id="iii.x.vi-p16"></span>5. Tertullian is a trustworthy witness of
these things. In the Apology for the Faith, which he addressed to the
Roman Senate, and which work we have already mentioned, <span
id="fr_1423"></span>[1424](#fn_1423.md) he confirms the history with
greater and stronger proofs.

<span id="iii.x.vi-p18"></span>6. He writes <span
id="fr_1424"></span>[1425](#fn_1424.md) that there are still extant
letters <span id="fr_1425"></span>[1426](#fn_1425.md) of the most
intelligent Emperor Marcus in which he testifies that his army, being on
the point of perishing with thirst in Germany, was saved by the prayers
of the Christians. And he says also that this emperor threatened
death <span id="fr_1426"></span>[1427](#fn_1426.md) to those who brought
accusation against us.

<span id="iii.x.vi-p22"></span>7. He adds further: <span
id="fr_1427"></span>[1428](#fn_1427.md)

<span id="iii.x.vi-p24"></span>“What kind of laws are those which
impious, unjust, and cruel persons use against us alone? which
Vespasian, though he had conquered the Jews, did not regard; <span
id="fr_1428"></span>[1429](#fn_1428.md) which Trajan partially annulled,
forbidding Christians to be sought after; <span
id="fr_1429"></span>[1430](#fn_1429.md) which neither Adrian, <span
id="fr_1430"></span>[1431](#fn_1430.md) though inquisitive in all matters,
nor he who was called Pius <span id="fr_1431"></span>[1432](#fn_1431.md)
sanctioned.” But let any one treat these things as he chooses; <span
id="fr_1432"></span>[1433](#fn_1432.md) we must pass on to what followed.

<span id="iii.x.vi-p30"></span>8. Pothinus having died with the other
martyrs in Gaul at ninety years of age, <span
id="fr_1433"></span>[1434](#fn_1433.md) Irenæus succeeded him in the
episcopate of the church at Lyons. <span
id="fr_1434"></span>[1435](#fn_1434.md) We have learned that, in his youth,
he was a hearer of Polycarp. <span id="fr_1435"></span>[1436](#fn_1435.md)

<span id="iii.x.vi-p34"></span>9. In the third book of his work Against
Heresies he has inserted a list of the bishops of Rome, bringing it down
as far as Eleutherus (whose times we are now considering), under whom he
composed his work. He writes as follows: <span
id="fr_1436"></span>[1437](#fn_1436.md)

<span id="fn_1415"></span>[219:1416](2010146.htm#fr_1415.md) <span
id="iii.x.vi-p2.2"></span>

<span id="iii.x.vi-p3"></span> The expression <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.x.vi-p3.1"></span>λόγος žχει</span>, employed here by Eusebius,
is ordinarily used by him to denote that the account which he subjoins
rests simply upon verbal testimony. But in the present instance he has
written authority, which he mentions below. He seems, therefore, in the
indefinite phrase <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.x.vi-p3.2"></span>λόγος žχει</span>, to express doubts which he
himself feels as to the trustworthiness of the account which he is about
to give. The story was widely known in his time, and the Christians’
version of it undoubtedly accepted by the Christians themselves with
little misgiving, and yet he is too well informed upon this subject to
be ignorant of the fact that the common version rests upon a rather
slender foundation. He may have known of the coins and monuments upon
which the emperor had commemorated his own view of the matter,—at any
rate he was familiar with the fact that all the heathen historians
contradicted the claims of the Christians, and hence he could not but
consider it a questionable matter. At the same time, the Christian
version of the story was supported by strong names and was widely
accepted, and he, as a good Christian, of course wished to accept it, if
possible, and to report it for the edification of posterity.

<span id="fn_1416"></span>[219:1417](2010146.htm#fr_1416.md) <span

<span id="iii.x.vi-p4"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.x.vi-p4.1"></span>τούτου δὲ ἀδελφόν</span>: the <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.x.vi-p4.2"></span>τούτου</span> referring to
the Antoninus mentioned at the close of the previous chapter. Upon
Eusebius’ confusion of the successors of Antoninus Pius, see below, p.
390, note.

<span id="fn_1417"></span>[219:1418](2010146.htm#fr_1417.md) <span
id="iii.x.vi-p4.3"></span>

<span id="iii.x.vi-p5"></span> It is an historical fact that, in 174
<span class="c13"><span id="iii.x.vi-p5.1"></span>a.d.</span>, the Roman
army in Hungary was relieved from a very dangerous predicament by the
sudden occurrence of a thunder-storm, which quenched their thirst and
frightened the barbarians, and thus gave the Romans the victory. By
heathen writers this event (quite naturally considered miraculous) was
held to have taken place in answer to prayer, but by no means in answer
to the prayers of the Christians. Dion Cassius (LXXI. 8) ascribes the
supposed miracle to the conjurations of the Egyptian magician Arnuphis;
Capitolinus (*Vita Marc. Aurelii,* chap. 24, and *Vita Heliogabali,*
chap. 9), to the prayer of Marcus Aurelius. The emperor himself
expresses his view upon a coin which represents Jupiter as hurling
lightning against the barbarians (see Eckhel. *Numism.* III. 61).

<span id="iii.x.vi-p6"></span>As early as the time of Marcus Aurelius
himself the Christians ascribed the merit of the supposed miracle to
their own prayers (e.g. Apolinarius, mentioned just below), and this
became the common belief among them (cf. Tertullian, *Apol.* chap. 5,
quoted just below, and *ad Scap.* chap. 4, and the forged edict of
Marcus Aurelius, appended to Justin Martyr’s first Apology). It is
probable that the whole legion prayed for deliverance to their
respective deities, and thus quite naturally each party claimed the
victory for its particular gods. That there were some Christians in the
army of Marcus Aurelius there is, of course, no reason to doubt, but
that a legion at that time was wholly composed of Christians, as
Eusebius implies, is inconceivable.

<span id="fn_1418"></span>[219:1419](2010146.htm#fr_1418.md) <span
id="iii.x.vi-p6.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.vi-p7"></span> This legion was called the Melitene from
the place where it was regularly stationed,—Melitene, a city in Eastern
Cappadocia, or Armenia.

<span id="fn_1419"></span>[220:1420](2010146.htm#fr_1419.md) <span
id="iii.x.vi-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.vi-p8"></span> Kneeling was the common posture of
offering prayer in the early Church, but the standing posture was by no
means uncommon, especially in the offering of thanksgiving. Upon Sunday
and during the whole period from Easter to Pentecost all prayers were
regularly offered in a standing position, as a symbolical expression of
joy (cf. Tertullian, *de Corona,* chap. 3; *de Oratione,* chap. 23,
&c.). The practice, however, was not universal, and was therefore
decreed by the Nicene Council in its twentieth canon (Hefele,
*Conciliengesch.* I. 430). See Kraus’ *Real-Encyclopädie der
Christlichen Alterthümer,* Bd. I. p. 557 sqq.

<span id="fn_1420"></span>[220:1421](2010146.htm#fr_1420.md) <span
id="iii.x.vi-p9.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.vi-p10"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.x.vi-p10.1"></span>λόγος žχει</span>. See above, note 1.

<span id="fn_1421"></span>[220:1422](2010146.htm#fr_1421.md) <span
id="iii.x.vi-p11.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.vi-p12"></span> Dion Cassius and Capitolinus record the
occurrence (as mentioned above, note 2). It is recorded also by other
writers after Eusebius’ time, such as Claudian and Zonaras. None of
them, however, attribute the occurrence to the prayers of the
Christians, but all claim it for the heathen gods. The only pre-Eusebian
*Christian* accounts of this event still extant are those contained in
the forged edict of Marcus Aurelius and in the *Apology* of Tertullian,
quoted just below (cf. also his *de Orat.* 29). Cyprian also probably
refers to the same event in his *Tractat. ad Demetriadem,* 20. Eusebius,
in referring to Apolinarius and Tertullian, very likely mentions all the
accounts with which he was acquainted. Gregory Nyssa, Jerome, and other
later Christian writers refer to the event.

<span id="fn_1422"></span>[220:1423](2010146.htm#fr_1422.md) <span
id="iii.x.vi-p13.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.vi-p14"></span> i.e. Claudius Apolinarius, bishop of
Hierapolis. Upon him and his writings, see above, Bk. IV. chap. 27, note
1. This reference is in all probability to the *Apology* of Apolinarius,
as this is the only work known to us which would have been likely to
contain an account of such an event. The fact that in the reign of the
very emperor under whom the occurrence took place, and in an Apology
addressed to him, the Christians could be indicated as the source of the
miracle, shows the firmness of this belief among the Christians
themselves, and also proves that they must have been so numerous in the
army as to justify them in setting up a counter-claim over against the
heathen soldiers.

<span id="iii.x.vi-p15"></span>Apolinarius is very far from the truth in
his statement as to the name of the legion. From Dion Cassius, LV. 23,
it would seem that the legion bore this name even in the time of
Augustus; but if this be uncertain, at any rate it bore it as early as
the time of Nero (as we learn from an inscription of his eleventh year,
*Corp. Ins. Lat.* III. 30). Neander thinks it improbable that
Apolinarius, a contemporary who lived in the neighborhood of the
legion’s winter quarters, could have committed such a mistake. He
prefers to think that the error is Eusebius’, and resulted from a too
rapid perusal of the passage in Apolinarius, where there must have stood
some such words as, “Now the emperor could with right call the legion
the Thundering Legion.” His opinion is at least plausible. Tertullian
certainly knew nothing of the naming of the legion at this time, or if
he had heard the report, rejected it.

id="iii.x.vi-p19.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.vi-p20"></span> A pretended epistle of Marcus Aurelius,
addressed to the Senate, in which he describes the miraculous
deliverance of his army through the prayers of the Christians, is still
extant, and stands at the close of Justin Martyr’s first Apology. It is
manifestly the work of a Christian, and no one now thinks of accepting
it as genuine. It is in all probability the same epistle to which
Tertullian refers, and therefore must have been forged before the end of
the second century, although its exact date cannot be determined. See
Overbeck, *Studien zur Gesch. d. alten Kirche,* I.

<span id="fn_1426"></span>[220:1427](2010146.htm#fr_1426.md) <span
id="iii.x.vi-p20.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.vi-p21"></span> The epistle says that the accuser is to
be burned alive (<span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.x.vi-p21.1"></span>ζῶντα καίεσθαι</span>). Tertullian simply
says that he is to be punished with a “condemnation of greater severity”
(*damnatione et quidem tetriore*). Eusebius therefore expresses himself
more definitely than Tertullian, though it is very likely that the poor
Greek translation which he used had already made of *damnatio tetrior*
the simpler and more telling expression, <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.x.vi-p21.2"></span>θανατός</span>.

<span id="iii.x.vi-p29"></span> Whether Eusebius refers in this remark
only to the report of Tertullian, or to the entire account of the
miracle, we do not know. The remark certainly has reference at least to
the words of Tertullian. Eusebius had apparently not himself seen the
epistle of Marcus Aurelius; for in the first place, he does not cite it;
secondly, he does not rest his account upon it, but upon Apolinarius and
Tertullian; and thirdly, in his *Chron.* both the Armenian and Greek
say, “*it is said* that there are epistles of Marcus Aurelius extant,”
while Jerome says directly, “*there are* letters extant.”
