<p class="c18"><a name="iv.vi.i.xliv-p2"></A><span class="c11"><a name="iv.vi.i.xliv-p2.1"></A>Such</span>, then, was his general character towards all. But he exercised a peculiar care over the church of God: and whereas, in the several provinces there were some who differed from each other in judgment, he, like some general bishop constituted by God, convened synods of his ministers. Nor did he disdain to be present and sit with them in their assembly, but bore a share in their deliberations, ministering to all that pertained to the peace of God. He took <A NAME="page_495"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 495</FONT></A> <a name="iv.vi.i.xliv-Page_495"></A>his seat, too, in the midst of them, as an individual amongst many, dismissing his guards and soldiers, and all whose duty it was to defend his person; but protected by the fear of God, and surrounded by the guardianship of his faithful friends. Those whom he saw inclined to a sound judgment, and exhibiting a calm and conciliatory temper, received his high approbation, for he evidently delighted in a general harmony of sentiment; while he regarded the unyielding wills with aversion.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3142"></A><A HREF="#fn_3142"><FONT SIZE="1">3143</FONT></A>

<p class="endnote"><a name="iv.vi.i.xliv-p3"></A> Constantine, like Eusebius himself, would be a distinct &#8220;tolerationist&#8221; in modern theological controversy. One may imagine that Eusebius entered into favor with Constantine in this way. It commends itself to our feeling; but after all, the unyielding Athanasius was a greater man than Eusebius.</p>
