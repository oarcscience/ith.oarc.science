<span id="iii.viii.xxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.viii.xxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVI.—</span>*Menander the
Sorcerer.*

<span id="iii.viii.xxvi-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.viii.xxvi-p2.1"></span>Menander</span>, <span
id="fr_812"></span>[813](#fn_812.md) who succeeded Simon Magus, <span
id="fr_813"></span>[814](#fn_813.md) showed himself in his conduct another
in<span id="page_158">p. 158</span> <span
id="iii.viii.xxvi-Page_158"></span>strument of diabolical power, <span
id="fr_814"></span>[815](#fn_814.md) not inferior to the former. He also
was a Samaritan and carried his sorceries to no less an extent than his
teacher had done, and at the same time reveled in still more marvelous
tales than he.

<span id="iii.viii.xxvi-p6"></span>2. For he said that he was himself
the Saviour, who had been sent down from invisible æons for the
salvation of men; <span id="fr_815"></span>[816](#fn_815.md) and he taught
that no one could gain the mastery over the world-creating angels
themselves <span id="fr_816"></span>[817](#fn_816.md) unless he had first
gone through the magical discipline imparted by him and had received
baptism from him. Those who were deemed worthy of this would partake
even in the present life of perpetual immortality, and would never die,
but would remain here forever, and without growing old become
immortal. <span id="fr_817"></span>[818](#fn_817.md) These facts can be
easily learned from the works of Irenæus. <span
id="fr_818"></span>[819](#fn_818.md)

<span id="iii.viii.xxvi-p11"></span>3. And Justin, in the passage in
which he mentions Simon, gives an account of this man also, in the
following words: <span id="fr_819"></span>[820](#fn_819.md) “And we know
that a certain Menander, who was also a Samaritan, from the village of
Capparattea, <span id="fr_820"></span>[821](#fn_820.md) was a disciple of
Simon, and that he also, being driven by the demons, came to
Antioch <span id="fr_821"></span>[822](#fn_821.md) and deceived many by his
magical art. And he persuaded his followers that they should not die.
And there are still some of them that assert this.”

<span id="iii.viii.xxvi-p15"></span>4. And it was indeed an artifice of
the devil to endeavor, by means of such sorcerers, who assumed the name
of Christians, to defame the great mystery of godliness by magic art,
and through them to make ridiculous the doctrines of the Church
concerning the immortality of the soul and the resurrection of the
dead. <span id="fr_822"></span>[823](#fn_822.md) But they that have chosen
these men as their saviours have fallen away from the true hope.

<span id="iii.viii.xxvi-p3"></span> Justin, in the passage quoted just
below, is the first one to tell us about Menander. According to him, he
was a Samaritan and a disciple of Simon Magus, and, like him, deceived
many by the practice of magic arts. Irenæus (*Adv. Hær.* I. 23) gives a
somewhat fuller account of him, very likely based upon Justin’s work
against heresies which the latter mentions in his *Apol.* I. 26, and
from which Irenæus quotes in IV. 6. 2 (at least he quotes from a *Contra
Marcionem,* which was in all probability a part of the same work; see
Bk. IV. chap. 11, note 22), and perhaps in V. 26. 2. From this account
of Irenæus that of Eusebius is drawn, and no new particulars are added.
Tertullian also mentions Menander (*De Anima,* 23, 50) and his
resurrection doctrine, but evidently knows only what Irenæus has already
told; and so the accounts of all the early Fathers rest wholly upon
Justin and Irenæus, and probably ultimately upon Justin alone. See
Salmon’s article *Menander* in the *Dict. of Christ. Biog.*

<span id="fn_813"></span>[157:814](2010095.htm#fr_813.md) <span

<span id="iii.viii.xxvi-p4"></span> Upon Simon Magus, see above, Bk. II.
chap. 13, note 3.

<span id="fn_814"></span>[158:815](2010095.htm#fr_814.md) <span
id="iii.viii.xxvi-p4.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.xxvi-p5"></span> “Instrument of diabolical power,” is
an embellishment of Eusebius’ own, quite in keeping with his usual
treatment of heretics. It is evident, however, that neither Justin nor
Irenæus looked upon Menander with any greater degree of allowance.

<span id="fn_815"></span>[158:816](2010095.htm#fr_815.md) <span
id="iii.viii.xxvi-p6.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.xxvi-p7"></span> Simon (Irenæus, I. 23. 1) taught
that he himself was the Supreme Power; but Menander, according to
Irenæus (*ibid.* §5), taught that the Supreme Power continues unknown to
all, but that he himself (as Eusebius here says) was sent forth as a
saviour for the deliverance of men.

<span id="fn_816"></span>[158:817](2010095.htm#fr_816.md) <span
id="iii.viii.xxvi-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.xxvi-p8"></span> He agreed with Simon in teaching
that the world was formed by angels who had taken their origin from the
Ennœa of the Supreme Power, and that the magical power which he imparted
enabled his followers to overcome these creative angels, as Simon had
taught of himself before him.

<span id="fn_817"></span>[158:818](2010095.htm#fr_817.md) <span
id="iii.viii.xxvi-p8.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.xxvi-p9"></span> This baptism (according to Irenæus
“into his own name”), and the promise of the resurrection as a result,
seem to have been an original addition of Menander’s. The exemption from
death taught by Menander was evidently understood by Irenæus, Tertullian
(*De Anima,* 50), and Eusebius in its physical, literal sense; but the
followers of Menander must of course have put a spiritual meaning upon
it, or the sect could not have continued in existence for any length of
time. It is certain that it was flourishing at the time of Justin; how
much longer we do not know. Justin himself does not emphasize the
physical element, and he undoubtedly understood that the immortality
taught was spiritual simply. Hegesippus (quoted below, in Bk. IV. chap.
22) mentions the Menandrianists, but this does not imply that he was
himself acquainted with them, for he draws his information largely from
Justin Martyr.

<span id="fn_818"></span>[158:819](2010095.htm#fr_818.md) <span
id="iii.viii.xxvi-p9.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.xxvi-p10"></span> Irenæus, *Adv. Hær.* I. 23. 5. In
III. 4. 3 he mentions Menander again, making him the father of all the
Gnostics.

<span id="fn_819"></span>[158:820](2010095.htm#fr_819.md) <span
id="iii.viii.xxvi-p11.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.xxvi-p12"></span> Justin, *Apol.* I. 26.

<span id="fn_820"></span>[158:821](2010095.htm#fr_820.md) <span
id="iii.viii.xxvi-p12.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.xxvi-p13"></span> The situation of the village of
Capparattea is uncertain. See Harnack’s *Quellen-Kritik des
Gnosticismus,* p. 84.

<span id="fn_821"></span>[158:822](2010095.htm#fr_821.md) <span
id="iii.viii.xxvi-p13.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.xxvi-p14"></span> Menander’s Antiochene activity is
reported only by Justin. It is probable, therefore, that Tertullian used
Irenæus alone in writing his account of Menander, for it is unlikely
that both of them would have omitted the same fact if they drew
independently from Justin.

<span id="fn_822"></span>[158:823](2010095.htm#fr_822.md) <span
id="iii.viii.xxvi-p15.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.xxvi-p16"></span> Cyril of Jerusalem (*Cat.* XVIII.
1) says that the denial of the resurrection of the body was a peculiarly
Samaritan heresy, and it would seem therefore that the heresy of these
Menandrianists was in that direction, i.e. that they taught rather a
spiritual immortality and denied a bodily resurrection (as suggested in
note 6); evidently, however, this was not Eusebius’ idea. He probably
looked upon them as discrediting the Christian doctrine of a
resurrection by teaching a physical immortality, which of course was
soon proved contrary to truth, and which thus, being confounded by the
masses with the doctrines of the Christians, brought the latter also
into contempt, and threw discredit upon immortality and resurrection of
every kind.
