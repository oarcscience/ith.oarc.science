<span id="iv.vi.i.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II.—</span>*The Preface Continued.*

<span id="iv.vi.i.ii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.ii-p2.1"></span>And</span> I am indeed amazed, when I
consider that he who was but lately visible and present with us in his
mortal body, is still, even after death, when the natural thought
disclaims everything superfluous as unsuitable, most marvelously endowed
with the same imperial dwellings, and honors, and praises as
heretofore. <span id="fr_3054"></span>[3055](#fn_3054) But farther,
<span id="page_482">p. 482</span> <span
id="iv.vi.i.ii-Page_482"></span>when I raise my thoughts even to the
arch of heaven, and there contemplate his thrice-blessed soul in
communion with God himself, freed from every mortal and earthly vesture,
and shining in a refulgent robe of light, and when I perceive that it is
no more connected with the fleeting periods and occupations of mortal
life, but honored with an ever-blooming crown, and an immortality of
endless and blessed existence, I stand as it were without power of
speech or thought <span id="fr_3055"></span>[3056](#fn_3055) and unable
to utter a single phrase, but condemning my own weakness, and imposing
silence on myself, I resign the task of speaking his praises worthily to
one who is better able, even to him who, being the immortal God and
veritable Word, alone has power to confirm his own sayings. <span

<span id="iv.vi.i.ii-p3"></span> Referring to special honors paid after
death, as mentioned in Bk. 4.

<span id="iv.vi.i.ii-p4"></span> Here there is play on the word Logos.
My logos stands voiceless and a-logos, “un-logosed.” If the author meant
both to refer to expression, the first relates to the sound, and the
second to the power of construction or composition. The
interchangeableness of the weaving of consecutive thought in the mind,
and the weaving it in expressed words, is precisely the question of the
“relation of thought and language,” so warmly contested by modern
philosophers and philologians (cf. Müller, *Science of Thought,* Shedd’s
Essays, &c.). The old use of logos for both operations of “binding
together” various ideas into one synthetical form has decided
advantages.

<span id="fn_3056"></span>[482:3057](2010387.htm#fr_3056) <span
id="iv.vi.i.ii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="iv.vi.i.ii-p5"></span> Here there is again the play on the
word Logos. For Eusebius’ philosophy of the logos, and of Christ as the
Logos or Word, see the second half of his tricennial oration and notes.
