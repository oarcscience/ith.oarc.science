<span id="iii.viii.xxii-p4"></span> We cannot doubt that the earliest
tradition made Evodius first bishop of Antioch, for otherwise we could
not explain the insertion of his name before the great name of Ignatius.
The tendency would be, of course, to connect Ignatius directly with the
apostles, and to make him the first bishop. This tendency is seen in
Athanasius and Chrysostom, who do not mention Evodius at all; also in
the *Apost. Const.* VII. 46, where, however, it is said that Evodius was
ordained by Peter, and Ignatius by Paul (as in the parallel case of
Clement of Rome). The fact that the name of Evodius appears here shows
that the tradition that he was the first bishop seemed to the author too
old and too strong to be set aside. Origen (*in Luc. Hom.* VI.) is an
indirect witness to the episcopacy of Evodius, since he makes Ignatius
the second, and not the first, bishop of Antioch. As to the respective
dates of the early bishops of Antioch, we know nothing certain. On their
chronology, see Harnack, *Die Zeit des Ignatius,* and cf. Salmon’s
article *Evodius,* in Smith and Wace’s *Dict. of Christ. Biog.*
