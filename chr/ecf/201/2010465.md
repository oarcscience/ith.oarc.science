id="iv.vi.ii.xx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XX</span>.—*Constantine’s
Enactments in Favor of the Confessors.*

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xx-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.xx-p2.1"></span>Moreover</span>, the emperor’s edicts,
permeated with his humane spirit, were published among us also, as they
had been among the inhabitants of the other division of the empire; and
his laws, which breathed a spirit of piety toward God, gave promise of
manifold blessings, since they secured many advantages to his provincial
subjects in every nation, and at the same time prescribed measures
suited to the exigencies of the churches of God. For first of all they
recalled those who, in consequence of their refusal to join in idol
worship, had been driven to exile, or ejected from their homes by the
governors of their respective provinces. In the next place, they
relieved from their burdens those who for the same reason had been
adjudged to serve in the civil courts, and ordained restitution to be
made to any who had been deprived of property. They too, who in the time
of trial had signalized themselves by fortitude of soul in the cause of
God, and had therefore been condemned to the painful labor of the mines,
or consigned to the solitude of islands, or compelled to toil in the
public works, all received an immediate release from these burdens;
while others, whose religious constancy had cost them the forfeiture of
their military rank, were vindicated by the emperor’s generosity from
this dishonor: for he granted them the alternative either of resuming
their rank, and enjoying their former privileges, or, in the event of
their preferring a more settled life, of perpetual exemption from all
service. Lastly, all who had been compelled by way of disgrace and
insult to serve in the employments of women, <span
