<span id="iv.vi.iii.xix-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIX</span>.—*Exhortation to
follow the Example of the Greater Part of the World.*

<span id="iv.vi.iii.xix-p2"></span>“<span class="c13"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.xix-p2.1"></span>Since</span>, therefore, it was needful
that this matter should be rectified, so that we might have nothing in
common with that nation of parricides who slew their Lord: and since
that arrangement is consistent with propriety which is observed by all
the churches of the western, southern, and northern parts of the world,
and by some of the eastern also: for these reasons all are unanimous on
this present occasion in thinking it worthy of adoption. And I myself
have undertaken that this decision should meet with the approval of your
Sagacities, <span id="fr_3255"></span>[3256](#fn_3255) in the hope that
your Wisdoms <span id="fr_3256"></span>[3257](#fn_3256) will gladly
admit that practice which is observed at once in the city of Rome, and
in Africa; throughout Italy, and in Egypt, in Spain, the Gauls, Britain,
Libya, and the whole of Greece; in the dioceses of Asia and Pontus, and
in Cilicia, with entire unity of judgment. And you will consider not
only that the number of churches is far greater in the regions I have
enumerated than in any other, but also that it is most fitting that all
should unite in desiring that which sound reason appears to demand, and
in avoiding all participation in the perjured conduct of the Jews. <span
id="fr_3257"></span>[3258](#fn_3257) In fine, that I may express my
meaning in as few words as possible, it has been determined by the
common judgment of all, that the most holy feast of Easter should be
kept on one and the same day. For on the one hand a discrepancy of
opinion on so sacred a question is unbecoming, and on the other it is
surely best to act on a decision which is free from strange folly and
error.

referring to the conduct of the Jews in professing to acknowledge God as
their king, and yet denying him by saying, “We have no king but
Cæsar.”—*Bag.*\]
