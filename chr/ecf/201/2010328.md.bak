<span id="iii.xvii.xxi-p1"></span> On Bk. VIII. chap. 2, § 4 (note 3,
continued). *The Causes of the Diocletian Persecution*.

<span id="iii.xvii.xxi-p2"></span>The persecution of Diocletian,
following as it did a period of more than forty years during which
Christianity had been recognized as a *religio licita*, and undertaken
as it was by a man who throughout the first eighteen years of his reign
had shown himself friendly to the Christians, and had even filled his
own palace with Christian servants, presents a very difficult problem to
the historian. Why did Diocletian persecute? The question has taxed the
ingenuity of many scholars and has received a great variety of answers.
Hunziker (in his *<span id="iii.xvii.xxi-p2.1"></span>Regierung und
Christenverfolgung des Kaisers Diocletianus und seiner Nachfolger*,
Leipzig, 1869), Burckhardt (in his *<span
id="iii.xvii.xxi-p2.2"></span>Zeit Constantins*, Basel, 1853, 2d and
improved edition, Leipzig, 1880), and A. J. Mason (in his *Persecution
of Diocletian*, Cambridge and London, 1876), not to mention other
investigators, have treated the subject with great ability and at
considerable <span id="page_398">p. 398</span> <span
id="iii.xvii.xxi-Page_398"></span>length, and the student is referred to
their works for a fuller examination of the questions involved. It is
not my purpose here to discuss the various views that have been
presented by others; but inasmuch as I am unable fully to agree with any
of them, I desire to indicate my own conception of the causes that led
to the persecution. We are left almost wholly to conjecture in the
matter; for our only authority, Lactantius, makes so many palpably
erroneous statements in his description of the causes which produced the
great catastrophe that little reliance can be placed upon him (see
Burckhardt’s demonstration of these errors, *ibid*. p. 289 sq.).
Nevertheless, he has preserved for us at least one fact of deep
significance, and it is a great merit of Mason’s discussion that he has
proved so conclusively the correctness of the report. The fact I refer
to is that the initiative came from Galerius, not from Diocletian
himself. Lactantius states this very distinctly and repeatedly, but it
has been argued by Hunziker and many others that the persecution had
been in Diocletian’s mind for a long time, and that it was but the
culmination of his entire policy. Having settled political matters, it
is said, he turned his attention to religious matters, and determined as
a step toward the restoration of the old Roman religion in its purity to
exterminate Christianity. But, as Mason shows, this is an entire
misconception of Diocletian’s policy. It had never been his intention to
attack Christianity. Such an attack was opposed to all his principles,
and was at length made only under the pressure of strong external
reasons. But though Mason has brought out this important fact so
clearly, and though he has shown that Galerius was the original mover in
the matter, he has, in my opinion, gone quite astray in his explanation
of the causes which led Diocletian to accede to the wishes of Galerius.
According to Mason, Diocletian was induced against his will to undertake
a course of action which his judgment told him was unwise. “But the
Cæsar \[Galerius\] was the younger and the stronger man; and a
determination to do has always an advantage over the determination not
to do. At length Diocletian broke down so far as to offer to forbid the
profession of the faith within the walls of his palace and under the
eagles of his legions. He was sure it was a mistaken policy. It was
certainly distasteful to himself. The army would suffer greatly by the
loss. Diocletian would have to part with servants to whom he was
attached,” &c. To my mind, it is impossible to believe that
Diocletian—great and wise emperor as he had proved himself, and with an
experience of over eighteen years of imperial power during which he had
always shown himself master—can thus have yielded simply to the
importunity of another man. Our knowledge of Diocletian’s character
should lead us to repudiate absolutely such a supposition. Feeling the
difficulty of his own supposition, Mason suggests that Diocletian may
have felt that it would be better for him to begin the persecution
himself, and thus hold it within some bounds, than to leave it for
Galerius to conduct when he should become emperor two years later. But
certainly if, as Mason assumes, Diocletian was convinced that the
measure was in itself vicious and impolitic, that was a most remarkable
course to pursue. To do a bad thing in order to leave no excuse for a
successor to do the same thing in a worse way—certainly that is hardly
what we should expect from the strongest and the wisest ruler Rome had
seen for three centuries. If he believed it ought not to be done, we may
be sure he would not have done it, and that neither Galerius nor any one
else could compel him to. He was not such a helpless tool in the hands
of others, nor was he so devoid of resources as to be obliged to prevent
a successor’s folly and wickedness by anticipating him in it, nor so
devoid of sense as to believe that he could. It is, in my opinion,
absolutely necessary to assume that Diocletian was convinced of the
necessity of proceeding against the Christians before he took the step
he did. How then are we to account for this change in his opinions?
Burckhardt attributes the change to the discovery of a plot among the
Christians. But the question naturally arises, what motive can the
Christians have had for forming a plot against an emperor so friendly to
them and a government under which they enjoyed such high honors?
Burckhardt gives no satisfactory answer to this very pertinent query,
and consequently his theory has not found wide acceptance. And yet I
believe he is upon the right track in speaking of a plot, though he has
not formed the right conception of its causes and nature, and has not
been able to urge any known facts in direct support of his theory. In my
opinion the key to the mystery lies in the fact which Lactantius states
and the truth of which Mason demonstrates, but which Burckhardt quite
overlooks, that the initiative came from Galerius, not Diocletian,
viewed in the light of the facts that Galerius had long been known to be
a bitter enemy of the Christians, and that he was to succeed Diocletian
within a couple of years. The course of events might be pictured
somewhat as follows. Some of the Christian officials and retainers of
Diocletian, fearing what might happen upon the accession of Galerius,
who was known to be a deadly enemy of the Christians, and who might be
expected, if not to persecute, at least to be a deadly enemy of the
Christian officials that had enjoyed Diocletian’s favor (Galerius
himself had only heathen officials in his court), conceived the idea of
frustrating in some way the appointed <span id="page_399">p. 399</span>
<span id="iii.xvii.xxi-Page_399"></span>succession and secure it for
some one who would be more favorable to them (possibly for the young
Constantine, who was then at Diocletian’s court, and who, as we know,
was later so cordially hated by Galerius). It may have been hoped by
some of them that it would be possible in the end to win Diocletian
himself over to the side of Christianity, and then induce him to change
the succession and transmit the power to a fitter prince. There may thus
have been nothing distinctly treasonable in the minds of any of them,
but there may have been enough to arouse the suspicions of Galerius
himself, who was the one most deeply interested, and who was always well
aware of the hatred which the Christians entertained toward him. We are
told by Lactantius that Galerius spent a whole winter with Diocletian,
endeavoring to persuade him to persecute. The latter is but a conclusion
drawn by Lactantius from the events which followed; for he tells us
himself that their conferences were strictly private, and that no one
knew to what they pertained. But why did the persecution of the
Christians at this particular time seem so important a thing to Galerius
that he should make this long and extraordinary visit to Nicomedia? Was
it the result of a fresh accession of religious zeal on his part? I
confess myself unable to believe that Galerius’ piety lay at the bottom
of the matter, and at any rate, knowing that he would himself be master
of the empire in two years, why could he not wait until he could take
matters into his own hands and carry them out after his own methods? No
one, so far as I know, has answered this question; and yet it is a very
pertinent one. It might be said that Galerius was afraid that he should
not be able to carry out such measures unless they had had the sanction
of his great predecessor. But Galerius never showed, either as Cæsar or
Augustus, any lack of confidence in himself, and I am inclined to think
that he would have preferred to enjoy the glory of the great undertaking
himself rather than give it all to another, had he been actuated simply
by general reasons of hostility toward the Church. But if we suppose
that he had conceived a suspicion of such a plan as has been suggested,
we explain fully his remarkable visit and his long and secret interviews
with Diocletian. There was no place in which he could discover more
about the suspected plot (which he might well fancy to be more serious
than it really was) than in Nicomedia itself; and if such a plot was on
foot, it was of vital importance to unearth it and reveal it to
Diocletian. We may believe then that Galerius busied himself during the
whole winter in investigating matters, and that long after he had become
thoroughly convinced of the existence of a plot Diocletian remained
skeptical.

<span id="iii.xvii.xxi-p3"></span>We may suppose that at the same time
whatever vague plans were in the minds of any of the Christians were
crystallizing during that winter, as they began to realize that
Galerius’ hold upon the emperor was such that the latter could never be
brought to break with him. We may thus imagine that while Galerius was
seeking evidence of a plot, the plot itself was growing and taking a
more serious shape in the minds at least some of the more daring and
worldly minded Christians. Finally, sufficient proof was gathered to
convince even Diocletian that there was some sort of a plot on foot, and
that the plotters were Christians. The question then arose what course
should be pursued in the matter. And this question may well have caused
the calling together of a number of counsellors and the consultation of
the oracle of Apollo of which Lactantius tells us. Galerius naturally
wished to exterminate the Christians as a whole, knowing their universal
hostility to him; but Diocletian just as naturally wished to punish only
such as were concerned in the plot, and was by no means convinced that
the Christians as a whole were engaged in it. The decision which was
reached, and which is exhibited in the edict of the 24th of February,
303 seems to confirm in a remarkable manner the theory which has been
presented. Instead of issuing an edict against Christians in general,
Diocletian directs his blows solely against Christians in governmental
circles,—public officials and servants in official families (cf. the
interpretation of the edict given above in Bk. VIII. chap. 2, note 6).
This is certainly not the procedure of an emperor who is persecuting on
religious grounds. The church officers should in that case have been
first attacked as they had been by Decius and Valerian. The singling out
of Christians in official circles—and the low as well as the high ones,
the servants as well as the masters—is a clear indication that the
motive was political, not religious. Moreover, that the edict was drawn
in such mild terms is a confirmation of this. These men were certainly
not all guilty, and it was not necessary to put them all to death. It
was necessary to put an end to the plot in the most expeditious and
complete way. The plotters should be shown that their plot was
discovered, and the whole thing should be broken up by causing some of
them to renounce their faith, by degrading and depriving of citizenship
all that would not renounce it. It was a very shrewd move. Executions
would but have increased the rebellious spirit and caused the plot to
spread. But Diocletian was well aware that any one that renounced his
faith would lose caste with his fellow-Christians, and even if he had
been a plotter in the past, he could never hope to gain anything in the
future from the accession of a Christian emperor. He was <span
id="page_400">p. 400</span> <span
id="iii.xvii.xxi-Page_400"></span>careful moreover to provide against
any danger from those who refused to renounce their faith, by putting
them into a position where it would be impossible for them to accomplish
anything in that line in the future. He knew that a plot which had no
support within official circles would be of no account and was not to be
feared. The action, based on the grounds given, was worthy of
Diocletian’s genius; explained in any other way it becomes, in my
opinion, meaningless. A further confirmation of the view which has been
presented is found in the silence of Lactantius and Eusebius. The former
was in Nicomedia, and cannot have failed to know the ostensible if not
the true cause of the great persecution. Diocletian cannot have taken
such a step without giving some reason for it, and doubtless that reason
was stated in the preambles of his edicts, as is the case in the edicts
of other emperors; but as it happens, while we know the substance of all
the edicts, not a single preamble has been preserved. May it not be
possible that the Christians, who preserved the terms of the edicts,
found the preambles distasteful because derogatory to some of themselves
and yet unfortunately not untrue? The reasons which Lactantius gives are
palpable makeshifts, and indeed he does not venture to state them
categorically. “I have learned,” he says, “that the cause of his fury
was as follows.” Doubtless he had heard it thus in Christian circles;
but doubtless he had heard it otherwise from heathen or from the edicts
themselves; and he can hardly, as a sensible man, have been fully
satisfied with his own explanation of the matter. Eusebius attempts no
explanation. He tells us in chapter I, above, that the Church just
before the persecution was in an abominable state and full of unworthy
Christians, and yet he informs us that he will pass by the unpleasant
facts to dwell upon the brighter side for the edification of posterity.
Was the cause of the persecution one of the unpleasant facts? He calls
it a judgment of God. Was it a merited judgment upon some who had been
traitors to their country? He gives us his opinion as to the causes of
the persecution of Decius and Valerian; why is he silent about the
causes of this greatest of all the persecutions? His silence in the
present case is eloquent.

<span id="iii.xvii.xxi-p4"></span>The course of events after the
publication of the First Edict is not difficult to follow. Fire broke
out twice in the imperial palace. Lactantius ascribes it to Galerius,
who was supposed to have desired to implicate the Christians; but, as
Burckhardt remarks, Diocletian was not the man to be deceived in that
way, and we may dismiss the suspicion as groundless. That the fires were
accidental is possible, but extremely improbable. Diocletian at least
believed that they were kindled by Christians, and it must be confessed
that he had some ground for his belief. At any rate, whether true or
not, the result was the torture (for the sake of extorting evidence) and
the execution of some of his most faithful servants (see Bk. VIII. chap.
6). It had become an earnest matter with Diocletian, and he was
beginning to feel—as he had never had occasion to feel before—that a
society within the empire whose claims were looked upon as higher than
those of the state itself, and duty to which demanded, in case of a
disagreement between it and the state, insubordination, and even
treason, toward the latter, was too dangerous an institution to tolerate
longer, however harmless it might be under ordinary circumstances. It
was at about this time that there occurred rebellions in Melitene and
Syria, perhaps in consequence of the publication of the First Edict; at
any rate, the Christians, who were regarded with ever increasing
suspicion, were believed to be in part at least responsible for the
outbreaks, and the result was that a second edict was issued, commanding
that all the rulers of the churches should be thrown into prison (see
above, Bk. VIII. chap. 6). Here Diocletian took the same step taken by
Decius and Valerian, and instituted thereby a genuine religious
persecution. It was now Christians as Christians whom he attacked; no
longer Christian officials as traitors. The vital difference between the
first and second edicts is very clear. All that followed was but the
legitimate carrying out of the principle adopted in the Second
Edict,—the destruction of the Church as such, the extermination of
Christianity.
