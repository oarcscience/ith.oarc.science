to the King of Persia,* <span id="fr_3313"></span>[3314](#fn_3313.md) *who
had sent him an Embassy, on Behalf of the Christians in his Realm.*

<span id="iv.vi.iv.viii-p3"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.viii-p3.1"></span>The</span> king of the Persians also
having testified a desire to form an alliance with Constantine, by
sending an embassy and presents as assurances of peace and friendship,
the emperor, in negotiating this treaty, far surpassed the monarch who
had first done him honor, in the magnificence with which he acknowledged
his gifts. Having heard, too, that there were many churches of God in
Persia, and that large numbers there were gathered into the fold of
Christ, full of joy at this intelligence, he resolved to extend his
anxiety for the general welfare to that country also, as one whose aim
it was to care for all alike in every nation.

<span id="iv.vi.iv.viii-p2"></span> Sapor II. (310–381) called the
Great, one of the Sassanidæ and afterwards the persistent enemy of the
sons of Constantine. He was at various times a bitter persecutor of the
Christians, and it is said (Plate) that “no Persian king had ever caused
such terror to Rome as this monarch.” Compare article by Plate on the
Sassanidæ in Smith, *Dict. of Gr. and R. Biog. and Mythol*.
