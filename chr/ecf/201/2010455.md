unable to resist the emperor’s first assault, threw down their arms, and
prostrated themselves at his feet. All these he spared, rejoicing to

accepted he ordered his army to commence the attack. On this they
immediately turned and betook themselves to flight; and some were

each other in the confusion of their flight, and perished by the swords
of their comrades.
