<span id="iii.x.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.x.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter X.—</span>*Pantænus the Philosopher.*

<span id="iii.x.xi-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.x.xi-p2.1"></span>About</span> that time, Pantænus, <span
id="fr_1504"></span>[1505](#fn_1504.md) a man highly distinguished for his
learning, had charge of the school of the faithful in Alexandria. <span
id="fr_1505"></span>[1506](#fn_1505.md) A school of sacred learning, which
continues to our day, was established there in ancient times, <span
id="fr_1506"></span>[1507](#fn_1506.md) <span id="page_225">p. 225</span>
<span id="iii.x.xi-Page_225"></span>and as we have been informed, <span
id="fr_1507"></span>[1508](#fn_1507.md) was managed by men of great ability
and zeal for divine things. Among these it is reported <span
id="fr_1508"></span>[1509](#fn_1508.md) that Pantænus was at that time
especially conspicuous, as he had been educated in the philosophical
system of those called Stoics.

<span id="iii.x.xi-p8"></span>2. They say that he displayed such zeal
for the divine Word, that he was appointed as a herald of the Gospel of
Christ to the nations in the East, and was sent as far as India. <span
id="fr_1509"></span>[1510](#fn_1509.md) For indeed <span
id="fr_1510"></span>[1511](#fn_1510.md) there were still many evangelists
of the Word who sought earnestly to use their inspired zeal, after the
examples of the apostles, for the increase and building up of the Divine
Word.

<span id="iii.x.xi-p11"></span>3. Pantænus was one of these, and is said
to have gone to India. It is reported that among persons there who knew
of Christ, he found the Gospel according to Matthew, which had
anticipated his own arrival. For Bartholomew, <span
id="fr_1511"></span>[1512](#fn_1511.md) one of the apostles, had preached
to them, and left with them the writing of Matthew in the Hebrew
language, <span id="fr_1512"></span>[1513](#fn_1512.md) which they had
preserved till that time.

<span id="iii.x.xi-p14"></span>4. After many good deeds, Pantænus
finally became the head of the school at Alexandria, <span
id="fr_1513"></span>[1514](#fn_1513.md) and expounded the treasures of
divine doctrine both orally and in writing. <span
id="fr_1514"></span>[1515](#fn_1514.md)

<span id="fn_1504"></span>[224:1505](2010151.htm#fr_1504.md) <span
id="iii.x.xi-p2.2"></span>

<span id="iii.x.xi-p3"></span> Pantænus is the first teacher of the
Alexandrian school that is known to us, and even his life is involved in
obscurity. His chief significance for us lies in the fact that he was
the teacher of Clement, with whom the Alexandrian school first steps out
into the full light of history, and makes itself felt as a power in
Christendom. Another prominent pupil of Pantænus was Alexander, bishop
of Jerusalem (see below, Bk. VI. chap. 14). Pantænus was originally a
Stoic philosopher, and must have discussed philosophy in his school in
connection with theology, for Origen appeals to him as his example in
this respect (see below, Bk. VI. chap. 19). His abilities are testified
to by Clement (in his *Hypotyposes*; see the next chapter, §4), who
speaks of him always in terms of the deepest respect and affection. Of
his birth and death we know nothing. Clement, *Strom.* I. 1, calls him a
“Sicilian bee,” which may, perhaps, have reference to his birthplace.
The statement of Philip of Side, that he was an Athenian, is worthless.
We do not know when he began his work in Alexandria, nor when he
finished it. But from Bk. VI. chap. 6 we learn that Clement had
succeeded Pantænus, and was in charge of the school in the time of
Septimius Severus. This probably means not merely that Pantænus had left
Egypt, but that he was already dead; and if that be the case, the
statement of Jerome (*de vir. ill.* 36), that Pantænus was in charge of
the school during the reigns of Septimius Severus and Caracalla, is
erroneous (Jerome himself expressly says, in *ibid*. chap. 38, that
Clement succeeded Pantænus upon the death of the latter). Jerome’s
statement, however, that Pantænus was sent to India by Demetrius, bishop
of Alexandria, is not necessarily in conflict with the indefinite
account of Eusebius, who gives no dates. What authority Jerome has for
his account we do not know. If his statement be correct, the journey
must have taken place after 190; and thus after, or in the midst or, his
Alexandrian activity. Eusebius apparently accepted the latter opinion,
though his statement at the end of this chapter is dark, and evidently
implies that he was very uncertain in regard to the matter. His whole
account rests simply on hearsay, and therefore too much weight must not
be laid upon its accuracy. After Clement comes upon the scene (which was
at least some years before the outbreak of the persecution of Severus,
200 <span class="c13"><span id="iii.x.xi-p3.1"></span>a.d.</span>—when
he left the city) we hear nothing more of Pantænus. Some have put his
journey to India in this later period; but this is contrary to the
report of Eusebius, and there is no authority for the opinion. Photius
(*Cod.* 118) records a tradition that Pantænus had himself heard some of
the apostles; but this is impossible, and is asserted by no one else.
According to Jerome, numerous commentaries of Pantænus were extant in
his time. Eusebius, at the close of this chapter, speaks of his
expounding the Scriptures “both orally and in writing,” but he does not
enumerate his works, and apparently had never seen them. No traces of
them are now extant, unless some brief reminiscences of his teaching,
which we have, are supposed to be drawn from his works, and not merely
from his lectures or conversations (see Routh, *Rel. Sac.* I. p.
375–383).

<span id="fn_1505"></span>[224:1506](2010151.htm#fr_1505.md) <span
id="iii.x.xi-p3.2"></span>

<span id="iii.x.xi-p4"></span> The origin of this school of the
faithful, or “catechetical school,” in Alexandria is involved in
obscurity. Philip of Side names Athenagoras as the founder of the
school, but his account is full of inconsistencies and contradictions,
and deserves no credence. The school first comes out into the light of
history at this time with Pantænus at its head, and plays a prominent
part in Church history under Clement, Origen, Heraclas, Dionysius,
Didymus, &c., until the end of the fourth century, when it sinks out of
sight in the midst of the dissensions of the Alexandrian church, and its
end like its beginning is involved in obscurity. It probably owed its
origin to no particular individual, but arose naturally as an outgrowth
from the practice which flourished in the early Church of instructing
catechumens in the elements of Christianity before admitting them to
baptism. In such a philosophical metropolis as Alexandria, a school,
though intended only for catechumens, would very naturally soon assume a
learned character, and it had already in the time of Pantænus at least
become a regular theological school for the preparation especially of
teachers and preachers. It exercised a great influence upon theological
science, and numbered among its pupils many celebrated theologians and
bishops. See the article by Redepenning in Herzog, 2d ed. I. 290–292,
and Schaff’s *Ch. Hist.* II. 777–781, where the literature of the
subject is given.

<span id="fn_1506"></span>[224:1507](2010151.htm#fr_1506.md) <span
id="iii.x.xi-p4.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.xi-p5"></span> Jerome (*de vir. ill.* c. 36) states that
there had always been ecclesiastical teachers in Alexandria from the
time of Mark. He is evidently, however, giving no independent tradition,
but merely draws his conclusion from the words of Eusebius who simply
says “from ancient times.” The date of the origin of the school is in
fact entirely unknown, though there is nothing improbable in the
statement of Jerome that ecclesiastical teachers were always there. It
must, however, have been some years before a school could be developed
or the need of it be felt.

id="iii.x.xi-p8.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.xi-p9"></span> Jerome (*de vir. ill.* 36) says that he
was sent to India by the bishop Demetrius at the request of the Indians
themselves,—a statement more exact than that of Eusebius, whether
resting upon tradition merely, or upon more accurate information, or
whether it is simply a combination of Jerome’s, we do not know. It is at
any rate not at all improbable (see above, note 1). A little farther on
Eusebius indicates that Pantænus preached in the same country in which
the apostle Bartholomew had done missionary work. But according to
Lipsius (*Dict. of Christ. Biog.* I. p. 22) Bartholomew’s traditional
field of labor was the region of the Bosphorus. He follows Gutschmid
therefore in claiming that the Indians here are confounded with the
Sindians, over whom the Bosphorian kings of the house of Polemo ruled.
Jerome (*Ep. ad Magnum;* Migne, *Ep.* 70) evidently regards the India
where Pantænus preached as India proper (*Pantænus Stoicæ sectæ
philosophus, ob pracipue eruditionis gloriam, a Demetrio Alexandriæ
episcopo missus est in Indiam, ut Christum apud Brachmanas, et illius
gentis philosophos prædicaret*). Whether the original tradition was that
Pantænus went to India, and his connection with Bartholomew (who was
wrongly supposed to have preached to the Indians) was a later
combination, or whether, on the other hand, the tradition that he
preached in Bartholomew’s field of labor was the original and the
mission to India a later combination, we cannot tell. It is probable
that Eusebius meant India proper, as Jerome certainly did, but both of
them may have been mistaken.

<span id="iii.x.xi-p10"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.x.xi-p10.1"></span>ἦ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.x.xi-p10.2"></span>σαν γὰρ, ἦσαν εἰσέτι</span>. Eusebius seems
to think it a remarkable fact that there should *still* have been
preaching evangelists. Evidently they were no longer common in his day.
It is interesting to notice that he calls them “evangelists.” In earlier
times they were called “apostles” (e.g. in the *Didache*), but the
latter had long before Eusebius’ time become a narrower, technical term.

<span id="fn_1512"></span>[225:1513](2010151.htm#fr_1512.md) <span
id="iii.x.xi-p12.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.xi-p13"></span> If the truth of this account be
accepted, Pantænus is a witness to the existence of a Hebrew Matthew.
See above, Bk. III. chap. 24, note 5. It has been assumed by some that
this Gospel was the Gospel according to the Hebrews (see Bk. III. chap.
25, note 24). This is possible; but even if Pantænus really did find a
Hebrew Gospel of Matthew as Eusebius says (and which, according to
Jerome, *de vir. ill.* 36, he brought back to Alexandria with him), we
have no grounds upon which to base a conclusion as to its nature, or its
relation to our Greek Matthew.

<span id="fn_1513"></span>[225:1514](2010151.htm#fr_1513.md) <span
id="iii.x.xi-p14.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.xi-p15"></span> Eusebius apparently puts the journey of
Pantænus in the middle of his Alexandrian activity, and makes him return
again and teach there until his death. Jerome also agrees in putting the
journey in the middle and not at the beginning or close of his
Alexandrian activity. It must be confessed, however, that Eusebius’
language is very vague, and of such a nature as perhaps to imply that he
really had no idea when the mission took place.
