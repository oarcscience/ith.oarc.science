<span id="iii.xii.xxxi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xii.xxxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXX</span>.—*The Epistle of the
Bishops against Paul.*

<span id="iii.xii.xxxi-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xii.xxxi-p2.1"></span>The</span> pastors who had assembled about
this matter, prepared by common consent an epistle addressed to
Dionysius, <span id="fr_2396"></span>[2397](#fn_2396.md) bishop of Rome,
and Maximus <span id="fr_2397"></span>[2398](#fn_2397.md) of Alexandria,
and sent it to all the provinces. In this they make manifest to all
their own zeal and the perverse error of Paul, and the arguments and
discussions which they had with him, and show the entire life and
conduct of the man. It may be well to put on record at the present time
the following extracts from their writing:

<span id="iii.xii.xxxi-p5"></span>2. “To Dionysius and Maximus, and to
all our fellow-ministers throughout the world, bishops, presbyters, and
deacons, and to the whole Catholic Church under heaven, <span
id="fr_2398"></span>[2399](#fn_2398.md) Helenus, <span
id="fr_2399"></span>[2400](#fn_2399.md) Hymenæus, Theophilus, Theotecnus,
Maximus, Proclus, Nicomas, Ælianus, Paul, Bolanus, Protogenes, Hierax,
Eutychius, Theodorus, <span id="fr_2400"></span>[2401](#fn_2400.md)
Malchion, and Lucius, and all the others who dwell with us in the
neighboring cities and nations, bishops, presbyters, and deacons, and
the churches of God, greeting to the beloved brethren in the Lord.”

<span id="iii.xii.xxxi-p9"></span>3. A little farther on they proceed
thus: “We sent for and called many of the bishops from a distance to
relieve us from this deadly doctrine; as Dionysius of Alexandria <span
id="fr_2401"></span>[2402](#fn_2401.md) and Firmilianus <span
id="fr_2402"></span>[2403](#fn_2402.md) of Cappadocia, <span
id="page_314">p. 314</span> <span
id="iii.xii.xxxi-Page_314"></span>those blessed men. The first of these
not considering the author of this delusion worthy to be addressed, sent
a letter to Antioch, <span id="fr_2403"></span>[2404](#fn_2403.md) not
written to him, but to the entire parish, of which we give a copy below.

<span id="iii.xii.xxxi-p13"></span>4. But Firmilianus came twice <span
id="fr_2404"></span>[2405](#fn_2404.md) and condemned his innovations, as
we who were present know and testify, and many others understand. But as
he promised to change his opinions, he believed him and hoped that
without any reproach to the Word what was necessary would be done. So he
delayed the matter, being deceived by him who denied even his own God
and Lord, <span id="fr_2405"></span>[2406](#fn_2405.md) and had not kept
the faith which he formerly held.

<span id="iii.xii.xxxi-p16"></span>5. And now Firmilianus was again on
his way to Antioch, and had come as far as Tarsus because he had learned
by experience his God-denying wickedness. But while we, having come
together, were calling for him and awaiting his arrival, he died.” <span
id="fr_2406"></span>[2407](#fn_2406.md)

<span id="iii.xii.xxxi-p18"></span>6. After other things they describe
as follows the manner of life which he <span
id="fr_2407"></span>[2408](#fn_2407.md) led:

<span id="iii.xii.xxxi-p20"></span>7. “Whereas he has departed from the
rule of faith, <span id="fr_2408"></span>[2409](#fn_2408.md) and has turned
aside after base and spurious teachings, it is not necessary,—since he
is without,—that we should pass judgment upon his practices: as for
instance in that although formerly destitute and poor, and having
received no wealth from his fathers, nor made anything by trade or
business, he now possesses abundant wealth through his iniquities and
sacrilegious acts, and through those things which he extorts from the
brethren, <span id="fr_2409"></span>[2410](#fn_2409.md) depriving the
injured of their rights and promising to assist them for reward, yet
deceiving them, and plundering those who in their trouble are ready to
give that they may obtain reconciliation with their oppressors,
‘supposing that gain is godliness’; <span
id="fr_2410"></span>[2411](#fn_2410.md) —

<span id="iii.xii.xxxi-p24"></span>8. or in that he is haughty, and is
puffed up, and assumes worldly dignities, preferring to be called
ducenarius <span id="fr_2411"></span>[2412](#fn_2411.md) rather than
bishop; and struts in the market-places, reading letters and reciting
them as he walks in public, attended by a body-guard, with a multitude
preceding and following him, so that the faith is envied and hated on
account of his pride and haughtiness of heart;—

<span id="iii.xii.xxxi-p26"></span>9. or in that he practices chicanery
in ecclesiastical assemblies, contrives to glorify himself, and deceive
with appearances, and astonish the minds of the simple, preparing for
himself a tribunal and lofty throne, <span
id="fr_2412"></span>[2413](#fn_2412.md) —not like a disciple of Christ,—and
possessing a ‘secretum,’ <span id="fr_2413"></span>[2414](#fn_2413.md)
—like the rulers of the world,—and so calling it, and striking his thigh
with his hand, and stamping on the tribunal with his feet;—or in that he
rebukes and insults those who do not applaud, and shake their
handkerchiefs as in the theaters, and shout and leap about like the men
and women that are stationed around him, and hear him in this unbecoming
manner, but who listen reverently and orderly as in the house of God;—or
in that he violently and coarsely assails in public the expounders of
the Word that have departed this life, and magnifies himself, not as a
bishop, but as a sophist and juggler,

<span id="iii.xii.xxxi-p29"></span>10. and stops the psalms to our Lord
Jesus Christ, as being the modern productions of modern men, and trains
women to sing psalms to himself in the midst of the church on the great
day of the passover, which any one might shudder to hear, and persuades
the bishops and presbyters of the neighboring districts and cities who
fawn <span id="page_315">p. 315</span> <span
id="iii.xii.xxxi-Page_315"></span>upon him, to advance the same ideas in
their discourses to the people.

<span id="iii.xii.xxxi-p30"></span>11. For to anticipate something of
what we shall presently write, he is unwilling to acknowledge that the
Son of God has come down from heaven. And this is not a mere assertion,
but it is abundantly proved from the records which we have sent you; and
not least where he says ‘Jesus Christ is from below.’ <span
id="fr_2414"></span>[2415](#fn_2414.md) But those singing to him and
extolling him among the people say that their impious teacher has come
down an angel from heaven. <span id="fr_2415"></span>[2416](#fn_2415.md)
And he does not forbid such things; but the arrogant man is even present
when they are uttered.

<span id="iii.xii.xxxi-p33"></span>12. And there are the women, the
‘subintroductæ,’ <span id="fr_2416"></span>[2417](#fn_2416.md) as the
people of Antioch call them, belonging to him and to the presbyters and
deacons that are with him. Although he knows and has convicted these
men, yet he connives at this and their other incurable sins, in order
that they may be bound to him, and through fear for themselves may not
dare to accuse him for his wicked words and deeds. <span
id="fr_2417"></span>[2418](#fn_2417.md) But he has also made them rich; on
which account he is loved and admired by those who covet such things.

<span id="iii.xii.xxxi-p36"></span>13. We know, beloved, that the bishop
and all the clergy should be an example to the people of all good works.
And we are not ignorant how many have fallen or incurred suspicion,
through the women whom they have thus brought in. So that even if we
should allow that he commits no sinful act, yet he ought to avoid the
suspicion which arises from such a thing, lest he scandalize some one,
or lead others to imitate him.

<span id="iii.xii.xxxi-p37"></span>14. For how can he reprove or
admonish another not to be too familiar with women,—lest he fall, as it
is written, <span id="fr_2418"></span>[2419](#fn_2418.md) —when he has
himself sent one away already, and now has two with him, blooming and
beautiful, and takes them with him wherever he goes, and at the same
time lives in luxury and surfeiting?

<span id="iii.xii.xxxi-p39"></span>15. Because of these things all mourn
and lament by themselves; but they so fear his tyranny and power, that
they dare not accuse him.

<span id="iii.xii.xxxi-p40"></span>16. But as we have said, while one
might call the man to account for this conduct, if he held the Catholic
doctrine and was numbered with us, <span
id="fr_2419"></span>[2420](#fn_2419.md) since he has scorned the mystery
and struts about in the abominable heresy of Artemas <span
id="fr_2420"></span>[2421](#fn_2420.md) (for why should we not mention his
father?), we think it unnecessary to demand of him an explanation of
these things.”

<span id="iii.xii.xxxi-p43"></span>17. Afterwards, at the close of the
epistle, they add these words:

<span id="iii.xii.xxxi-p44"></span>“Therefore we have been compelled to
excommunicate him, since he sets himself against God, and refuses to
obey; and to appoint in his place another bishop for the Catholic
Church. By divine direction, as we believe, we have appointed
Domnus, <span id="fr_2421"></span>[2422](#fn_2421.md) who is adorned with
all the qualities becoming in a bishop, and who is a son of the blessed
Demetrianus, <span id="fr_2422"></span>[2423](#fn_2422.md) who formerly
presided in a distinguished manner over the same parish. We have
informed you of this that you may write to him, and may receive letters
of communion <span id="fr_2423"></span>[2424](#fn_2423.md) from him. But
let this man write to Artemas; and let those who think as Artemas does,
communicate with him.” <span id="fr_2424"></span>[2425](#fn_2424.md)

<span id="iii.xii.xxxi-p49"></span><span id="page_316">p. 316</span>
<span id="iii.xii.xxxi-Page_316"></span>18. As Paul had fallen from the
episcopate, as well as from the orthodox faith, Domnus, as has been
said, became bishop of the church at Antioch.

<span id="iii.xii.xxxi-p50"></span>19. But as Paul refused to surrender
the church building, the Emperor Aurelian was petitioned; and he decided
the matter most equitably, ordering the building to be given to those to
whom the bishops of Italy and of the city of Rome should adjudge
it. <span id="fr_2425"></span>[2426](#fn_2425.md) Thus this man was driven
out of the church, with extreme disgrace, by the worldly power.

<span id="iii.xii.xxxi-p52"></span>20. Such was Aurelian’s treatment of
us at that time; but in the course of his reign he changed his mind in
regard to us, and was moved by certain advisers to institute a
persecution against us. <span id="fr_2426"></span>[2427](#fn_2426.md) And
there was great talk about this on every side.

<span id="iii.xii.xxxi-p54"></span>21. But as he was about to do it, and
was, so to speak, in the very act of signing the decrees against us, the
divine judgment came upon him and restrained him at the very verge <span
id="fr_2427"></span>[2428](#fn_2427.md) of his undertaking, showing in a
manner that all could see clearly, that the rulers of this world can
never find an opportunity against the churches of Christ, except the
hand that defends them permits it, in divine and heavenly judgment, for
the sake of discipline and correction, at such times as it sees best.

<span id="iii.xii.xxxi-p56"></span>22. After a reign of six years, <span
id="fr_2428"></span>[2429](#fn_2428.md) Aurelian was succeeded by Probus.
He reigned for the same number of years, and Carus, with his sons,
Carinus and Numerianus, succeeded him. After they had reigned less than
three years the government devolved on Diocletian, and those associated
with him. <span id="fr_2429"></span>[2430](#fn_2429.md) Under them took
place the persecution of our time, and the destruction of the churches
connected with it.

<span id="iii.xii.xxxi-p59"></span>23. Shortly before this,
Dionysius, <span id="fr_2430"></span>[2431](#fn_2430.md) bishop of Rome,
after holding office for nine years, died, and was succeeded by
Felix. <span id="fr_2431"></span>[2432](#fn_2431.md)

Hierax is possibly the bishop addressed by Dionysius in the epistle

Maximus of Bostra and Nicomas of Iconium, in chap. 28, as distinguished
bishops. Of the others we know nothing.

<span id="iii.xii.xxxi-p8"></span> It has been suggested that Theodorus
may be Gregory Thaumaturgus, who was also known by that name (see Bk.
VI. chap. 30); but this is extremely improbable for everywhere else in
referring to him as bishop, Eusebius calls him Gregory, and in chap. 31
speaks of him as one of the most celebrated bishops, and puts him near
the head of the list. Here Theodorus is placed near the end of the list,
and no prominence is given him. There is in fact no reason to identify
the two. The name Theodorus was a very common one.

<span id="iii.xii.xxxi-p12"></span> On this epistle, see chap. 27, note
6. As we see from this passage, the epistle of Dionysius was addressed
not to Paul himself, but to the council, and hence could not be
identified with the epistle given by Labbe, even were the latter
authentic.

<span id="fn_2404"></span>[314:2405](2010248.htm#fr_2404.md) <span
id="iii.xii.xxxi-p13.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.xxxi-p14"></span> It is plain from this passage that
the case of Paul of Samosata had been discussed in at least two
Antiochian synods before the one which deposed him, and not only in one
as has been claimed. The passage shows, too, the way in which Paul
escaped condemnation so long. Not merely on account of his influential
position, as some have said, but also because he promised that he would
give up his heresy and conform his teaching to the orthodox faith. The
language would seem to imply that Firmilian had presided at the synod or
synods, which are referred to here; and this is assumed by most writers.
On Firmilian, see Bk. VI. chap. 26, note 3.

<span id="fn_2405"></span>[314:2406](2010248.htm#fr_2405.md) <span
id="iii.xii.xxxi-p14.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.xxxi-p15"></span> The words “and Lord” are wanting in
some good <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xii.xxxi-p15.1"></span>mss.</span> as well as in Rufinus, and
are consequently omitted by Schwegler and Heinichen. But I have
preferred to follow the majority of the <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xii.xxxi-p15.2"></span>mss.</span> and all the other editors in
retaining the words which are really necessary to the sense; for it is
not meant that Paul denied God, but that he denied his God and Lord
Jesus Christ; namely, by rejecting his essential deity.

<span id="fn_2411"></span>[314:2412](2010248.htm#fr_2411.md) <span
id="iii.xii.xxxi-p24.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.xxxi-p25"></span> Paul was the “Procurator Ducenarius”
of Zenobia, the queen of Palmyra, an official so-called because his
salary was 200 sestertia. “The Ducenarius was an imperial procurator,
so-called from his salary of 200 sesteria, or 1600 pounds a year. Some
critics suppose that the bishop of Antioch had actually obtained such an
office from Zenobia” (Gibbon). There seems to be no reason to doubt that
Paul held such a position under Zenobia, which appears to be the
implication of the words here, and so he is commonly spoken of as a high
official, even as “Viceroy” of Zenobia. We know from Athanasius (*Hist.
Ar*. §71, Oxf. ed. Chap. VIII. §10), that he was a great favorite with
Zenobia, and that to her he owed the privilege of retaining his
bishopric after the synod had deposed him. This friendship shown toward
him by Zenobia, who was of the strictest manners, is much in his favor,
and almost tempts us to doubt the terrible character given him in this
epistle by the members of the synod. There must have been some
palliating circumstances in the case. He can hardly have been as
unqualifiedly bad as this letter paints him.

<span id="fn_2412"></span>[314:2413](2010248.htm#fr_2412.md) <span
id="iii.xii.xxxi-p26.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.xxxi-p27"></span> Valesius says, “The Fathers do not
here condemn Paul because he had a throne; …but because he erected a
tribunal for himself in the church and placed upon that a high throne.
Rufinus, therefore, translates this passage correctly: *In ecclesia vero
tribunal sibi multo altius quam fuerat exstrui, et thronum in
excelsioribus collocari jubet.* Bishops did sit on a seat a little
higher than the rest of the presbyters, but they did not have a
tribunal.” This has been frequently quoted, and is on the whole a true
statement of facts. But the Greek is <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xii.xxxi-p27.1"></span>βῆμα μὲν καὶ θρόνον ὑψηλόν</span>, and
Rufinus is certainly wrong in putting his *multo altius* with the
tribunal. The emphasis, as the Greek reads, is upon the <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.xii.xxxi-p27.2"></span>βῆμα</span> as such,
not upon the height of it, while the <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xii.xxxi-p27.3"></span>θρόνος</span> is condemned because of its
height. The translation of Rufinus shows what was the custom in his day.
He could not understand that a <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xii.xxxi-p27.4"></span>βῆμα</span> should be objected to as
such.

<span id="fn_2413"></span>[314:2414](2010248.htm#fr_2413.md) <span
id="iii.xii.xxxi-p27.5"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.xxxi-p28"></span> Greek <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xii.xxxi-p28.1"></span>σήκρητον</span>, for the Latin
*secretum,* which was the name of the place where the civil magistrates
and higher judges sat to decide cases, and which was raised and enclosed
with railings and curtains in order to separate it from the people. In
the present case it means of course a sort of cabinet which Paul had at
the side of the tribunal, in which he could hold private conferences,
and whose resemblance to the *secretum* of a civil magistrate he
delighted to emphasize.

<span id="fn_2414"></span>[315:2415](2010248.htm#fr_2414.md) <span
id="iii.xii.xxxi-p30.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.xxxi-p31"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xii.xxxi-p31.1"></span>᾽</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xii.xxxi-p31.2"></span>Ιησοῦν χριστὸν κ€τωθεν</span>. Compare,
by way of contrast, the words of [John iii.
31](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#031.md)<span
id="iii.xii.xxxi-p31.3"></span>: “He that cometh from above is above
all” (<span class="Greek"><span id="iii.xii.xxxi-p31.4"></span>ὁ</span>
<span class="Greek"><span id="iii.xii.xxxi-p31.5"></span>ἄνωθεν
ἐρχόμενος ἐπ€νω π€ντων ἐστίν</span>). The words quoted in the epistle
can hardly have been used by Paul himself. They are rather to be
regarded as a logical inference from his positions stated by the writers
of the epistle in order to bring out the blasphemous nature of his views
when contrasted with the statement in John, which was doubtless in their
minds while they wrote.

<span id="fn_2415"></span>[315:2416](2010248.htm#fr_2415.md) <span
id="iii.xii.xxxi-p31.6"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.xxxi-p32"></span> The account seems to me without
doubt overdrawn at this point. It was such a common thing, from the time
of Herod Agrippa down, to accuse a man who was noted for his arrogance
of encouraging the people to call him an angel descended from heaven,
that we should almost be surprised if the accusation were omitted here.
We have no reason to think, in spite of the report of these good
Fathers, that Paul’s presumption went to such a blasphemous and at the
same time absurd length.

<span id="iii.xii.xxxi-p35"></span> It is quite probable that Paul had
given some ground for the suspicions which the worthy bishops breathe
here, but that is very far from saying that he was actually guilty of
immorality. In fact, just below (§13), they show that these are nothing
more than suspicions. Exactly what position the two women held who are
mentioned in §14 it is difficult to say, but Paul must of course have
given some plausible reason for their presence, and this is implied in
§16, where the writers say that were he orthodox, they would inquire his
reasons for this conduct, but since he is a heretic, it is not worth
while to investigate the matter. As remarked above, while the direct
statements of the epistle can in the main hardly be doubted, we must
nevertheless remember that the prejudices of the writers would lead them
to paint the life of Paul as black as circumstances could possibly
warrant, and unfounded suspicions might therefore easily be taken as
equivalent to proved charges.

<span id="iii.xii.xxxi-p41"></span> We get a glimpse here of the
relative importance of orthodoxy and morality in the minds of these
Fathers. Had Paul been orthodox, they would have asked him to explain
his course, and would have endeavored to persuade him to reform his
conduct; but since he was a heretic, it was not worth while. It is
noticeable that he is not condemned because he is immoral, but because
he is heretical. The implication is that he might have been even worse
than he was in his morals and yet no decisive steps have been taken
against him, had he not deviated from the orthodox faith. The Fathers,
in fact, by their letters, put themselves in a sad dilemma. Either Paul
was not as wicked as they try to make him out, or else they were
shamefully indifferent to the moral character of their bishops, and even
of the incumbents of their most prominent sees.

<span id="iii.xii.xxxi-p42"></span> On Artemas, or Artemon, see Bk. V.

above, chap. 27, note 4.

<span id="iii.xii.xxxi-p45"></span> The action of this council in
appointing Domnus was entirely irregular, as the choice of the bishop
devolved upon the clergy and the people of the diocese. But the synod
was afraid that Paul’s influence would be great enough to secure his
re-election, and hence they took this summary means of disposing of him.
But it was only after the accession of Aurelian that Paul was actually
removed from his bishopric and Domnus was enabled to enter upon his
office (see chap. 27, note 4). The exact date of Domnus’ appointment is
uncertain, as already shown (see the note just referred to); so also the
date of his death. Both versions of the *Chron.* put his accession in
the year of Abr. 2283 (<span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xii.xxxi-p45.1"></span>a.d.</span> 265), and Jerome’s version
puts the accession of his successor, Timæus, in the year of Abr. 2288
(<span class="c13"><span id="iii.xii.xxxi-p45.2"></span>a.d.</span>
270), while the Armenian omits the notice entirely. We can place no
reliance whatever upon these dates; the date of Domnus’ death is
certainly at least two years too early (see the note already referred
to).

<span id="iii.xii.xxxi-p47"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xii.xxxi-p47.1"></span>τὰ κοινωνικὰ γρ€μματα</span>. Valesius
says: “The Latins call them *literas communicatorias,* and the use of
them is very ancient in the Church. They were also called *formatæ* (cf.
Augustine Epistle 163). These writers were of two kinds: the one given
to the clergy and laity when they were going to travel, in order that
they might be admitted to communion by foreign bishops: while the other
kind were sent by bishops to other bishops to declare their communion
with them, and were in turn received from other bishops. Of the latter
the synod speaks here. They were usually sent by new bishops soon after
their ordination.” Valesius refers to Augustine (*ibid.*), to Cyprian’s
epistle to Cornelius (*Ep.* 41, *al.* 45), and to the synodical epistle
of the Council of Sardica.

<span id="iii.xii.xxxi-p48"></span> This is a very keen bit of sarcasm.
As Harnack remarks, the mention of Artemas in this way proves (or at
least renders it very probable) that he was still alive at this time, in
which case his activity in Rome must be put somewhat later than the
commonly accepted dates, viz. the episcopate of Zephyrinus (202–217).

<span id="iii.xii.xxxi-p53"></span> Aurelian, according to tradition,
was the author of the ninth of the “ten great persecutions” against the
Church. But the report is a mistake. Eusebius apparently is the ultimate
source to which the report is to be referred, but he says expressly that
he died before he was able to begin his intended persecution, and more
than that, that he was even prevented from signing the decree, so that
it is not proper to speak even of an hostile edict of Aurelian (as many
do who reject the actual persecution). It is true that in Lactantius’
*De mort. persecutorum,* chap. 6, it is said that Aurelian actually
issued edicts against the Christians, but that he died before they had
found their way to the most distant provinces. It seems probable,
however, that Eusebius’ account is nearest the truth, and that the
reports that Aurelian actually signed the edicts as well as that he
commenced the persecution are both developments from the original and
more correct version of the affair which Eusebius gives. There is no
reason to doubt the account of Eusebius. Aurelian’s conduct in the case
of Paul does not imply any special friendliness on his part toward the
Church. The Christians had secured legal recognition under Gallienus;
and it was a simple act of common justice to put the valuable property
of the Church in Antioch into the hands of the rightful owners whoever
they might be. His act does imply, however, that he cannot have been in
the beginning actively hostile to the Church, for in that case he would
simply have driven Paul out, and confiscated the property.

<span id="iii.xii.xxxi-p57"></span> Aurelian reigned from 270 to 275,
and was succeeded by Tacitus, who ruled only six months, and he in turn
by Probus (276 to 282), who was followed by Carus and his sons Carinus
and Numerian, and they in turn by Diocletian in 284. Eusebius here omits
Tacitus, although he mentions him in his *Chron.,* and assigns six
months to his reign, and five years and six months to the reign of
Aurelian.

<span id="iii.xii.xxxi-p58"></span> Diocletian associated Maximian with
himself in the government in 286, and sent him to command the West with
the title of Augustus. In 293 he appointed Constantius Chlorus and
Galerius as Cæsars, giving to the former the government of Gaul and
Britain, to the latter that of the provinces between the Adriatic and
the Euxine, while Maximian held Africa and Italy, and Diocletian himself
retained the provinces of Asia. He issued an edict, opening his famous
persecution against the Christians, of which Eusebius gives an account
in the next book, on Feb. 23, 303.

id="iii.xii.xxxi-p60.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.xxxi-p61"></span> According to the Liberian catalogue,
Felix became bishop on the fifth of January, 269, and held office five
years eleven months and twenty-five days, until the thirtieth of
December, 274, and these dates Lipsius accepts as correct. Eusebius, in
chap. 32, gives five years as the duration of his episcopate, and with
this Jerome’s version of the *Chron.* agrees, while the Armenian gives
nineteen years, which is absolutely inconsistent with its own notices,
and must be of course a copyist’s mistake. Jerome puts the accession of
Felix in the first year of Probus, which is wide of the mark, and the
Armenian in the first year of Aurelian, which is not so far out of the
way.

<span id="iii.xii.xxxi-p62"></span>Felix addressed a letter, in regard
to Paul of Samosata, to Maximus and the clergy of Antioch, of which
fragments have been preserved in the Apology of Cyril of Alexandria, and
in the Acts of the Council of Ephesus (given by Mansi, *Conc.* I. 1114).
The report of his martyrdom is probably a mistake, and has resulted from
confusing him with Felix II., who was bishop of Rome in the fourth
century.
