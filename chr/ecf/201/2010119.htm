 was succeeded in the government of the Romans by Antoninus, called the Pious. In the first year of his reign Telesphorus&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1059"></A><A HREF="#fn_1059"><FONT SIZE="1">1060</FONT></A>
 died in the eleventh year of his episcopate, and Hyginus became bishop of Rome.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1060"></A><A HREF="#fn_1060"><FONT SIZE="1">1061</FONT></A>
 Iren&aelig;us records that Telesphorus&#146; death was made glorious by martyrdom,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1061"></A><A HREF="#fn_1061"><FONT SIZE="1">1062</FONT></A>
 and in the same connection he states that in the time of the above-mentioned Roman bishop Hyginus, Valentinus, the founder of a sect of his own, and Cerdon, the author of Marcion&#146;s error, were both well known at Rome.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1062"></A><A HREF="#fn_1062"><FONT SIZE="1">1063</FONT></A>

<p class="endnote"><a name="iii.ix.x-p4"></A> On Telesphorus, see above, chap. 5, note 13. The date given here by Eusebius (138&#8211;139 <span class="c13"><a name="iii.ix.x-p4.1"></A>a.d.</span>) is probably (as remarked there) at least a year too late.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="iii.ix.x-p5"></A> We know very little about Hyginus. His dates can be fixed with tolerable certainty as 137&#8211;141, the duration of his episcopate being four years, as Eusebius states in the next chapter. See Lipsius&#146; <i>Chron. d. r&ouml;m. Bisch&ouml;fe,</i> p. 169 and 263. The Roman martyrologies make him a martyr, but this means nothing, as the early bishops of Rome almost without exception are called martyrs by these documents. The forged decretals ascribe to him the introduction of a number of ecclesiastical rites.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="iii.ix.x-p6"></A> In his <i>Adv. H&aelig;r.</i> III. 3. 3. The testimony of Iren&aelig;us rests upon Roman tradition at this point, and is undoubtedly reliable. Telesphorus is the first Roman bishop whom we know to have suffered martyrdom, although the Roman Catholic Church celebrates as martyrs all the so-called popes down to the fourth century.</p>
