id="iv.vi.ii.xliii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLIII</span>.—*How the
Enactments of Constantine were carried into Effect.*

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xliii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.xliii-p2.1"></span>Such</span> were the injunctions
contained in the first letter which the emperor addressed to us. And the
provisions of this enactment were speedily carried into effect,
everything being conducted in a manner quite different from the
atrocities which had but lately been daringly perpetrated during the
cruel ascendancy of the tyrants. Those persons also who were legally
entitled to it, received the benefit of the emperor’s liberality.
