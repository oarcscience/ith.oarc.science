id="iv.vii.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II</span>.—*An Appeal to the Church
and to his Hearers to pardon and correct the Errors of His Speech.*

<span id="iv.vii.ii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vii.ii-p2.1"></span>Hear</span> then, thou master <span
id="fr_3369"></span>[3370](#fn_3369.md) of the ship, possessor of virgin
purity, and thou Church, the cherisher of tender and inexperienced age,
guardian of truth and gentleness, through whose perennial fountain the
stream <span id="fr_3370"></span>[3371](#fn_3370.md) of salvation flows! Be
ye also indulgent, my hearers, who worship God sincerely, and are,
therefore, the objects of his care: attending, not to the language, but
to the truth of what is said; not to him who speaks, but rather to the
pious zeal which hallows his discourse! For what will be the use of
words when the real purpose of the speaker remains unknown? It may be,
indeed, that I essay great things; the love of God which animates my
soul, a love which overpowers natural reserve, is my plea for the bold
attempt. On you, then, I call, who are best instructed in the mysteries
of God, to aid me with your counsel, to follow me with your thoughts,
and correct whatever shall savor of error in my words, expecting no
display of perfect knowledge, but graciously accepting the sincerity of
my endeavor. And may the Spirit of the Father and the Son accord his
mighty aid, while I utter the words which he shall suggest to speech or
thought. <span id="fr_3371"></span>[3372](#fn_3371.md) For if any one,
whether in the practice of eloquence, or any other art, expects to
produce a finished work without the help of God, both the author and his
efforts will be found alike imperfect; while he has no cause to fear, no
room for discouragement, <span id="fr_3372"></span>[3373](#fn_3372.md) who
has once been blessed with the inspiration of Heaven. Wherefore asking
your indulgence for the length of this preface, let us attempt the theme
in its utmost scope. <span id="fr_3373"></span>[3374](#fn_3373.md)

substantially by *Bag.,* omitting <span class="Greek"><span

principal matter of our design.” *Hein.* retains <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.vii.ii-p7.2"></span>πρός</span>, and like
*Molz.* renders “proceed, as well as I may, to my theme.” He means
rather that having God’s help he will not fear to “essay great things.”
