<span id="iii.xi.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xi.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.—</span>*The pupils of Origen that
became Martyrs.*

<span id="iii.xi.iv-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xi.iv-p2.1"></span>The</span> first of these was Plutarch, who
was mentioned just above. <span id="fr_1793"></span>[1794](#fn_1793) As
he was led to death, the man of whom we are speaking being with him at
the end of his life, came near being slain by his fellow-citizens, as if
he were the cause of his death. But the providence of God preserved him
at this time also.

<span id="iii.xi.iv-p4"></span>2. After Plutarch, the second martyr
among the pupils of Origen was Serenus, <span
id="fr_1794"></span>[1795](#fn_1794) who gave through fire a proof of
the faith which he had received.

<span id="iii.xi.iv-p6"></span>3. The third martyr from the same school
was Heraclides, <span id="fr_1795"></span>[1796](#fn_1795) and after him
the fourth was Hero. <span id="fr_1796"></span>[1797](#fn_1796) The
former of these was as yet a catechumen, and the latter had but recently
been baptized. Both of them were beheaded. After them, the fifth from
the same school proclaimed as an athlete of piety was another Serenus,
who, it is reported, was beheaded, after a long endurance of tortures.
And of women, Herais <span id="fr_1797"></span>[1798](#fn_1797) died
while yet a catechumen, receiving baptism by fire, as Origen himself
somewhere says.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1793"></span>[252:1794](2010174.htm#fr_1793) <span
id="iii.xi.iv-p2.2"></span>

<span id="iii.xi.iv-p3"></span> See the previous chapter, §2. The
martyrdom of these disciples of Origen took place under Aquila, and
hence the date depends on the date of his rule, which cannot be fixed
with exactness, as remarked in note 4 on the previous chapter.

<span id="fn_1794"></span>[252:1795](2010174.htm#fr_1794) <span
id="iii.xi.iv-p4.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xi.iv-p5"></span> These two persons named Serenus, the
first of whom was burned, the second beheaded, are known to us only from
this chapter.

<span id="fn_1795"></span>[252:1796](2010174.htm#fr_1795) <span
id="iii.xi.iv-p6.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xi.iv-p7"></span> Of this Heraclides, we know only what is
told us in this chapter. He, with the other martyrs mentioned in this
connection, is commemorated in the mediæval martyrologies, but our
authentic information is limited to what Eusebius tells us here.

<span id="fn_1796"></span>[252:1797](2010174.htm#fr_1796) <span
id="iii.xi.iv-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xi.iv-p8"></span> Our authentic information of Hero is
likewise limited to this account of Eusebius.

<span id="fn_1797"></span>[252:1798](2010174.htm#fr_1797) <span
id="iii.xi.iv-p8.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xi.iv-p9"></span> Herais likewise is known to us from this
chapter alone. It is interesting to note that Origen’s pupils were not
confined to the male sex. His association with female catechumens, which
his office of instructor entailed upon him, formed one reason for the
act of self-mutilation which he committed (see chap. 8, §2).
