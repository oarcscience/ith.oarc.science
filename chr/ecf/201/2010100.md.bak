<span id="iii.viii.xxxi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.viii.xxxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXI.—</span>*The Death of John
and Philip.*

<span id="iii.viii.xxxi-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.viii.xxxi-p2.1"></span>The</span> time and the manner of the
death of Paul and Peter as well as their burial places, have been
already shown by us. <span id="fr_852"></span>[853](#fn_852.md)

<span id="iii.viii.xxxi-p4"></span>2. The time of John’s death has also
been given in a general way, <span id="fr_853"></span>[854](#fn_853.md) but
his burial place is indicated by an epistle of Polycrates <span
id="fr_854"></span>[855](#fn_854.md) (who was bishop of the parish of
Ephesus), addressed to Victor, <span id="fr_855"></span>[856](#fn_855.md)
bishop of Rome. In this epistle he mentions him together with the
apostle Philip and his daughters in the following words: <span
id="fr_856"></span>[857](#fn_856.md)

<span id="iii.viii.xxxi-p9"></span>3. “For in Asia also great lights
have fallen asleep, which shall rise again on the last day, at the
coming of the Lord, when he shall come with glory from heaven and shall
seek out all the saints. Among these are Philip, one of the twelve
apostles, <span id="fr_857"></span>[858](#fn_857.md) who sleeps in
Hierapolis, <span id="fr_858"></span>[859](#fn_858.md) and his two aged
virgin daughters, and another daughter who lived in the Holy Spirit and
now rests at Ephesus; <span id="fr_859"></span>[860](#fn_859.md) and <span
id="page_163">p. 163</span> <span
id="iii.viii.xxxi-Page_163"></span>moreover John, who was both a
witness <span id="fr_860"></span>[861](#fn_860.md) and a teacher, who
reclined upon the bosom of the Lord, and being a priest wore the
sacerdotal plate. <span id="fr_861"></span>[862](#fn_861.md) He also sleeps
at Ephesus.” <span id="fr_862"></span>[863](#fn_862.md)

<span id="iii.viii.xxxi-p16"></span>4. So much concerning their death.
And in the Dialogue of Caius which we mentioned a little above, <span
id="fr_863"></span>[864](#fn_863.md) Proclus, <span
id="fr_864"></span>[865](#fn_864.md) against whom he directed his
disputation, in agreement with what has been quoted, <span
id="fr_865"></span>[866](#fn_865.md) speaks thus concerning the death of
Philip and his daughters: “After him <span
id="fr_866"></span>[867](#fn_866.md) there were four prophetesses, the
daughters of Philip, at Hierapolis in Asia. Their tomb is there and the
tomb of their father.” Such is his statement.

<span id="iii.viii.xxxi-p22"></span>5. But Luke, in the Acts of the
Apostles, mentions the daughters of Philip who were at that time at
Cæsarea in Judea with their father, and were honored with the gift of
prophecy. His words are as follows: “We came unto Cæsarea; and entering
into the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, we
abode with him. Now this man had four daughters, virgins, which did
prophesy.” <span id="fr_867"></span>[868](#fn_867.md)

<span id="iii.viii.xxxi-p24"></span>6. We have thus set forth in these
pages what has come to our knowledge concerning the apostles themselves
and the apostolic age, and concerning the sacred writings which they
have left us, as well as concerning those which are disputed, but
nevertheless have been publicly used by many in a great number of
churches, <span id="fr_868"></span>[869](#fn_868.md) and moreover,
concerning those that are altogether rejected and are out of harmony
with apostolic orthodoxy. Having done this, let us now proceed with our
history.

id="iii.viii.xxxi-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.xxxi-p8"></span> This epistle is the only writing of
Polycrates which is preserved to us. This passage, with considerably
more of the same epistle, is quoted below in Bk. V. chap. 24. From that
chapter we see that the epistle was written in connection with the
Quarto-deciman controversy, and after saying, “We therefore observe the
genuine day,” Polycrates goes on in the words quoted here to mention the
“great lights of Asia” as confirming his own practice. (See the notes
upon the epistle in Bk. V. chap. 24.) The citation here of this
incidental passage from a letter upon a wholly different subject
illustrates Eusebius’ great diligence in searching out all historical
notices which could in any way contribute to his history.

<span id="fn_857"></span>[162:858](2010100.htm#fr_857.md) <span
id="iii.viii.xxxi-p9.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.xxxi-p10"></span> Philip the apostle and Philip the
evangelist are here confounded. That they were really two different men
is clear enough from Luke’s account in the Acts (cf. [Acts
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#002.md), [Acts
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#014.md), [Acts
21:8](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#008.md)<span
id="iii.viii.xxxi-p10.1"></span>[Acts vi.
2-5](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#002.md)<span
id="iii.viii.xxxi-p10.2"></span>, viii. 14–17, and xxi. 8). That it was
the evangelist, and not the apostle, that was buried in Hierapolis may
be assumed upon the following grounds: (1) The evangelist (according to
[Acts xxi. 8](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#008.md)<span
id="iii.viii.xxxi-p10.3"></span>) had four daughters, who were virgins
and prophetesses. Polycrates speaks here of three daughters, at least
two of whom were virgins, and Proclus, just below, speaks of four
daughters who were prophetesses. (2) Eusebius, just below, expressly
identifies the apostle and evangelist, showing that in his time there
was no separate tradition of the two men. Lightfoot (*Colossians,* p.
45) maintains that Polycrates is correct, and that it was the apostle,
not the evangelist, that was buried in Hierapolis; but the reasons which
he gives are trivial and will hardly convince scholars in general.
Certainly we need strong grounds to justify the separation of two men so
remarkably similar so far as their families are concerned. But the truth
is, there is nothing more natural than that later generations should
identify the evangelist with the apostle of the same name, and should
assume the presence of the latter wherever the former was known to have
been. This identification would in itself be a welcome one to the
inhabitants of Hierapolis, and hence it would be assumed there more
readily than anywhere else. Of course it is not impossible that Philip
the apostle also had daughters who were virgins and prophetesses, but it
is far more probable that Polycrates (and possibly Clement too; see the
previous chapter) confounded him with the evangelist,—as every one may
have done for some generations before them. Eusebius at any rate,
historian though he was, saw no difficulty in making the identification,
and certainly it was just as easy for Polycrates and Clement to do the
same. Lightfoot makes something of the fact that Polycrates mentions
only three daughters, instead of four. But the latter’s words by no
means imply that there had not been a fourth daughter (see note 8,
below).

<span id="fn_858"></span>[162:859](2010100.htm#fr_858.md) <span
id="iii.viii.xxxi-p10.4"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.xxxi-p11"></span> Hierapolis was a prominent city in
Proconsular Asia, about five miles north of Laodicea, in connection with
which city it is mentioned in [Col. iv.
13](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#013.md)<span
id="iii.viii.xxxi-p11.1"></span>. The ruins of this city are quite
extensive, and its site is occupied by a village called Pambouk Kelessi.

<span id="fn_859"></span>[162:860](2010100.htm#fr_859.md) <span
id="iii.viii.xxxi-p11.2"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.xxxi-p12"></span> The fact that only three of
Philip’s daughters are mentioned here, when from the Acts we know he had
four, shows that the fourth had died elsewhere; and therefore it would
have been aside from Polycrates’ purpose to mention her, since, as we
see from Bk. V. chap. 24, he was citing only those who had lived in Asia
(the province), and had agreed as to the date of the Passover. The
separate mention of this third daughter by Polycrates has been supposed
to arise from the fact that she was married, while the other two
remained virgins. This is, however, not at all implied, as the fact that
she was buried in a different place would be enough to cause the
separate mention of her. Still, inasmuch as Clement (see the preceding
chapter) reports that Philip’s daughters were married, and inasmuch as
Polycrates expressly states that two of them were virgins, it is quite
possible that she (as well as the fourth daughter, not mentioned here)
may have been a married woman, which would, perhaps, account for her
living in Ephesus and being buried there, instead of with her father and
sister in Hierapolis. It is noticeable that while two of the daughters
are expressly called virgins, the third is not.

<span id="fn_861"></span>[163:862](2010100.htm#fr_861.md) <span
id="iii.viii.xxxi-p13.2"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.xxxi-p14"></span> The Greek word is <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.viii.xxxi-p14.1"></span>πέταγον</span>,
which occurs in the LXX. as the technical term for the plate or diadem
of the high priest (cr. [Ex. xxviii.
36](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#036.md)<span
id="iii.viii.xxxi-p14.2"></span>, &c.). What is meant by the word in the
present connection is uncertain. Epiphanius (*Hær.* LXXVII. 14) says the
same thing of James, the brother of the Lord. But neither James nor John
was a Jewish priest, and therefore the words can be taken literally in
neither case. Valesius and others have thought that John and James, and
perhaps others of the apostles, actually wore something resembling the
diadem of the high priest; but this is not at all probable. The words
are either to be taken in a purely figurative sense, as meaning that
John bore the character of a priest,—i.e. the high priest of Christ as
his most beloved disciple,—or, as Hefele suggests, the report is to be
regarded as a mythical tradition which arose after the second Jewish
war. See Kraus’ *Real-Encyclopædie der christlichen Alterthümer,* Band
II. p. 212 sq.

<span id="iii.viii.xxxi-p17"></span> Bk. II. chap. 25, §6, and Bk. III.
chap. 28, §1. Upon Caius and his dialogue with Proclus, see the former
passage, note 8.

id="iii.viii.xxxi-p17.1"></span>

<span id="fn_865"></span>[163:866](2010100.htm#fr_865.md) <span
id="iii.viii.xxxi-p18.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.xxxi-p19"></span> The agreement of the two accounts
is not perfect, as Polycrates reports that two daughters were buried at
Hierapolis and one at Ephesus, while Proclus puts them all four at
Hierapolis. But the report of Polycrates deserves our credence rather
than that of Proclus, because, in the first place, Polycrates was
earlier than Proclus; in the second place, his report is more exact, and
it is hard to imagine how, if all four were really buried in one place,
the more detailed report of Polycrates could have arisen, while on the
other hand it is quite easy to explain the rise of the more general but
inexact account of Proclus; for with the general tradition that Philip
and his daughters lived and died in Hierapolis needed only to be
combined the fact that he had four daughters, and Proclus’ version was
complete. In the third place, Polycrates’ report bears the stamp of
truth as contrasted with mere legend, because it accounts for only three
daughters, while universal tradition speaks of four.

<span id="iii.viii.xxxi-p20"></span>How Eusebius could have overlooked
the contradiction it is more difficult to explain. He can hardly have
failed to notice it, but was undoubtedly unable to account for the
difference, and probably considered it too small a matter to concern
himself about. He was quite prone to accept earlier accounts just as
they stood, whether contradictory or not. The fact that they had been
recorded was usually enough for him, if they contained no improbable or
fabulous stories. He cannot be accused of intentional deception at this
point, for he gives the true accounts side by side, so that every reader
might judge of the agreement for himself. Upon the confusion of the
apostle and evangelist, see above, note 6.

<span id="fn_866"></span>[163:867](2010100.htm#fr_866.md) <span
id="iii.viii.xxxi-p20.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.xxxi-p21"></span> I read <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.viii.xxxi-p21.1"></span>μετὰ τοῦτον</span> with the majority of
the <span class="c13"><span id="iii.viii.xxxi-p21.2"></span>mss.</span>,
with Burton, Routh, Schwegler, Heinichen, &c., instead of <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.viii.xxxi-p21.3"></span>μετὰ τοῦτο</span>,
which occurs in some <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.viii.xxxi-p21.4"></span>mss.</span> and in Rufinus, and is
adopted by Valesius, Crusè, and others. As Burton says, the copyists of
Eusebius, not knowing to whom Proclus here referred, changed <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.viii.xxxi-p21.5"></span>τοῦτον</span> to
<span class="Greek"><span id="iii.viii.xxxi-p21.6"></span>τοῦτο</span>;
but if we had the preceding context we should find that Proclus had been
referring to some prophetic man such as the Montanists were fond of
appealing to in support of their position. Schwegler suggests that it
may have been the Quadratus mentioned in chap. 37, but this is a mere
guess. As the sentence stands isolated from its connection, <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.viii.xxxi-p21.7"></span>τοῦτον</span> is the
harder reading, and could therefore have more easily been changed into
<span class="Greek"><span id="iii.viii.xxxi-p21.8"></span>τοῦτο</span>
than the latter into <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.viii.xxxi-p21.9"></span>τοῦτον</span>.

[9](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#009.md)<span
id="iii.viii.xxxi-p23.2"></span>. Eusebius clearly enough considers
Philip the apostle and Philip the evangelist identical. Upon this
identification, see note 6, above.

<span id="fn_868"></span>[163:869](2010100.htm#fr_868.md) <span
id="iii.viii.xxxi-p24.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.xxxi-p25"></span> <span class="Greek"><span

id="iii.viii.xxxi-p25.3"></span>…</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.viii.xxxi-p25.4"></span>δεδημοσιευμένων</span>. The
classification here is not inconsistent with that given in chap. 25, but
is less complete than it, inasmuch as here Eusebius draws no distinction
between <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.viii.xxxi-p25.5"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.viii.xxxi-p25.6"></span>ντιλεγόμενα</span> and <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.viii.xxxi-p25.7"></span>νόθοι</span>, but
uses the former word in its general sense, and includes under it both
the particular classes (*Antilegomena* and <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.viii.xxxi-p25.8"></span>νόθοι</span>) of chap. 25 (see note 27
on that chapter).
