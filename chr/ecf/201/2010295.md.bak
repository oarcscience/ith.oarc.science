<span id="iii.xv.x-p1"></span> <span id="page_366">p. 366</span> <span

id="iii.xv.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter X.—</span>*The Overthrow of the
Tyrants and the Words which they uttered before their Death.* <span
id="fr_2776"></span>[2777](#fn_2776.md)

<span id="iii.xv.x-p3"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xv.x-p3.1"></span>The</span> circumstances which drove him to
this course were the following. Being no longer able to sustain the
magnitude of the government which had been undeservedly committed to
him, in consequence of his want of prudence and imperial understanding,
he managed affairs in a base manner, and with his mind unreasonably
exalted in all things with boastful pride, even toward his colleagues in
the empire who were in every respect his superiors, in birth, in
training, in education, in worth and intelligence, and, greatest of all,
in temperance and piety toward the true God, he began to venture to act
audaciously and to arrogate to himself the first rank. <span
id="fr_2777"></span>[2778](#fn_2777.md)

<span id="iii.xv.x-p5"></span>2. Becoming mad in his folly, he broke the
treaties which he had made with Licinius <span
id="fr_2778"></span>[2779](#fn_2778.md) and undertook an implacable war.
Then in a brief time he threw all things into confusion, and stirred up
every city, and having collected his entire force, comprising an immense
number of soldiers, he went forth to battle with him, elated by his
hopes in demons, whom he supposed to be gods, and by the number of his
soldiers.

<span id="iii.xv.x-p7"></span>3. And when he joined battle <span
id="fr_2779"></span>[2780](#fn_2779.md) he was deprived of the oversight of
God, and the victory was given to Licinius, <span
id="fr_2780"></span>[2781](#fn_2780.md) who was then ruling, by the one and
only God of all.

<span id="iii.xv.x-p10"></span>4. First, the army in which he trusted
was destroyed, and as all his guards abandoned him and left him alone,
and fled to the victor, he secretly divested himself as quickly as
possible of the imperial garments, which did not fitly belong to him,
and in a cowardly and ignoble and unmanly way mingled with the crowd,
and then fled, concealing himself in fields and villages. <span
id="fr_2781"></span>[2782](#fn_2781.md) But though he was so careful for
his safety, he scarcely escaped the hands of his enemies, revealing by
his deeds that the divine oracles are faithful and true, in which it is
said, “A king is not saved by a great force, and a giant shall not be
saved by the greatness of his strength; a horse is a vain thing for
safety, nor shall he be delivered by the greatness of his power.

<span id="iii.xv.x-p12"></span>5. Behold, the eyes of the Lord are upon
them that fear him, upon them that hope in his mercy, to deliver their
souls from death.” <span id="fr_2782"></span>[2783](#fn_2782.md)

<span id="iii.xv.x-p14"></span>6. Thus the tyrant, covered with shame,
went to his own country. And first, in frantic rage, he slew many
priests and prophets of the gods whom he had formerly admired, and whose
oracles had incited him to undertake the war, as sorcerers and
impostors, and besides all as betrayers of his safety. Then having given
glory to the God of the Christians and enacted a most full and complete
ordinance in behalf of their liberty, <span
id="fr_2783"></span>[2784](#fn_2783.md) he was immediately seized with a
mortal disease, and no respite being granted him, departed this
life. <span id="fr_2784"></span>[2785](#fn_2784.md) The law enacted by him
was as follows:

<span id="iii.xv.x-p17"></span>Copy of the edict of the tyrant in behalf
of the Christians, translated from the Roman tongue.

<span id="iii.xv.x-p18"></span>7. “The Emperor Cæsar Caius Valerius
Maximinus, Germanicus, Sarmaticus, Pius, Felix, Invictus, Augustus. We
believe it manifest that no one is ignorant, but that every man who
looks back over the past knows and is conscious that in every way we
care continually for the good of our provincials, and wish to furnish
them with those things which are of especial advantage to all, and for
the common benefit and profit, and whatever contributes to the public
welfare and is agreeable to the views of each.

<span id="iii.xv.x-p19"></span>8. When, therefore, before this, it
became clear to our mind that under pretext of the command of our
parents, the most divine Diocletian and Maximianus, which enjoined that
the meetings of the <span id="page_367">p. 367</span> <span
id="iii.xv.x-Page_367"></span>Christians should be abolished, many
extortions <span id="fr_2785"></span>[2786](#fn_2785.md) and spoliations
had been practiced by officials; and that those evils were continually
increasing, to the detriment of our provincials toward whom we are
especially anxious to exercise proper care, and that their possessions
were in consequence perishing, letters were sent last year <span
id="fr_2786"></span>[2787](#fn_2786.md) to the governors of each province,
in which we decreed that, if any one wished to follow such a practice or
to observe this same religion, he should be permitted without hindrance
to pursue his purpose and should be impeded and prevented by no one, and
that all should have liberty to do without any fear or suspicion that
which each preferred.

<span id="iii.xv.x-p22"></span>9. But even now we cannot help perceiving
that some of the judges have mistaken our commands, and have given our
people reason to doubt the meaning of our ordinances, and have caused
them to proceed too reluctantly to the observance of those religious
rites which are pleasing to them.

<span id="iii.xv.x-p23"></span>10. In order, therefore, that in the
future every suspicion of fearful doubt may be taken away, we have
commanded that this decree be published, so that it may be clear to all
that whoever wishes to embrace this sect and religion is permitted to do
so by virtue of this grant of ours; and that each one, as he wishes or
as is pleasing to him, is permitted to practice this religion which he
has chosen to observe according to his custom. It is also granted them
to build Lord’s houses.

<span id="iii.xv.x-p24"></span>11. But that this grant of ours may be
the greater, we have thought good to decree also that if any houses and
lands before this time rightfully belonged to the Christians, and by the
command of our parents fell into the treasury, or were confiscated by
any city,—whether they have been sold or presented to any one as a
gift,—that all these should be restored to their original possessors,
the Christians, in order that in this also every one may have knowledge
of our piety and care.”

<span id="iii.xv.x-p25"></span>12. These are the words of the tyrant
which were published not quite a year after the decrees against the
Christians engraved by him on pillars. <span
id="fr_2787"></span>[2788](#fn_2787.md) And by him to whom a little before
we seemed impious wretches and atheists and destroyers of all life, so
that we were not permitted to dwell in any city nor even in country or
desert,—by him decrees and ordinances were issued in behalf of the
Christians, and they who recently had been destroyed by fire and sword,
by wild beasts and birds of prey, in the presence of the tyrant himself,
and had suffered every species of torture and punishment, and most
miserable deaths as atheists and impious wretches, were now acknowledged
by him as possessors of religion and were permitted to build churches;
and the tyrant himself bore witness and confessed that they had some
rights.

<span id="iii.xv.x-p27"></span>13. And having made such confessions, as
if he had received some benefit on account of them, he suffered perhaps
less than he ought to have suffered, and being smitten by a sudden
scourge of God, he perished in the second campaign of the war.

<span id="iii.xv.x-p28"></span>14. But his end was not like that of
military chieftains who, while fighting bravely in battle for virtue and
friends, often boldly encounter a glorious death; for like an impious
enemy of God, while his army was still drawn up in the field, remaining
at home and concealing himself, he suffered the punishment which he
deserved. For he was smitten with a sudden scourge of God in his whole
body, and harassed by terrible pains and torments, he fell prostrate on
the ground, wasted by hunger, while all his flesh was dissolved by an
invisible and God-sent fire, so that the whole appearance of his frame
was changed, and there was left only a kind of image wasted away by
length of time to a skeleton of dry bones; so that those who were
present could think of his body as nothing else than the tomb of his
soul, which was buried in a body already dead and completely melted
away.

<span id="iii.xv.x-p29"></span>15. And as the heat still more violently
consumed him in the depths of his marrow, his eyes burst forth, and
falling from their sockets left him blind. Thereupon still breathing and
making free confession to the Lord, he invoked death, and at last, after
acknowledging that he justly suffered these things on account of his
violence against Christ, he gave up the ghost.

id="iii.xv.x-p3.2"></span>

<span id="iii.xv.x-p4"></span> That Maximin should arrogate to himself,
as Eusebius says, the highest rank is not very surprising, when we
realize that that position, in so far as any difference in rank between
the different rulers was acknowledged, belonged to him by right,
inasmuch as he was Constantine’s senior (having been first Cæsar when
the latter was only second), while Constantine (see above, chap. 9, note
2) was regarded as the senior of Licinius.

<span id="fn_2778"></span>[366:2779](2010295.htm#fr_2778.md) <span

id="iii.xv.x-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xv.x-p8"></span> This battle between Licinius and Maximin
was fought on April 30, 313, at Adrianople, in Thrace. For a more
detailed but somewhat imaginative account of the battle, see *De mort.
pers.* chap. 45 sq. Lactantius is considerate enough to accord Licinius
the honor of a divine vision, that he may not be behind his imperial
colleague Constantine; and he is pious enough to ascribe the victory
wholly to the divine aid vouchsafed in response to the prayers of
Licinius and his soldiers.

<span id="fn_2780"></span>[366:2781](2010295.htm#fr_2780.md) <span
id="iii.xv.x-p8.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xv.x-p9"></span> The word Licinius is omitted by Laemmer
and Heinichen, but without sufficient warrant, for it is found in nearly
all the <span class="c13"><span id="iii.xv.x-p9.1"></span>mss</span>.

<span id="fn_2781"></span>[366:2782](2010295.htm#fr_2781.md) <span
id="iii.xv.x-p10.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xv.x-p11"></span> Lactantius (*ibid.* chap. 47) informs us
that Maximin’s flight was so rapid that he reached Nicomedia, which was
160 miles from Adrianople, on the evening of the day following the
battle. As Gibbon remarks, “The incredible speed which Maximin exerted
in his flight is much more celebrated than his prowess in battle.”

<span id="fn_2783"></span>[366:2784](2010295.htm#fr_2783.md) <span
id="iii.xv.x-p14.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xv.x-p15"></span> The final toleration edict of Maximin
must have been issued very soon after his defeat, and its occasion is
plain enough. If he were to oppose Licinius successfully, he must secure
the loyalty of all his subjects, and this could be done only by granting
the Christians full toleration. He could see plainly enough that
Licinius’ religious policy was a success in securing the allegiance of
his subjects, and he found himself compelled in self-defense to pursue a
similar course, distasteful as it was to him. There is no sign that he
had any other motive in taking this step. Religious considerations seem
to have had nothing to do with it; he was doubtless as much of a pagan
as ever. The edict itself is composed in an admirable vein. As Mason
remarks, “Maximin made the concession with so much dignity and grace,
that it is impossible to help wishing that his language were truer.” As
in the previous decree, he indulges his passion for lying without
restraint; but, unlike that one, the present edict is straightforward
and consistent throughout, and grants the Christians full liberty in the
most unequivocal terms.

<span id="fn_2784"></span>[366:2785](2010295.htm#fr_2784.md) <span
id="iii.xv.x-p15.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xv.x-p16"></span> Maximin’s death took place at Tarsus
(according to *De mort. pers.* chap. 49), and apparently within a few
weeks after his defeat at Adrianople and the publication of his edict of
toleration. The reports of his death are somewhat conflicting. Zosimus
and the epitomist of Victor say merely that he died a natural death;
Lactantius tells us that he took poison; while Eusebius in § 14 sq.
gives us a horrible account of his last sickness which, according to
him, was marked, to say the least, with some rather remarkable symptoms.
Mason facetiously remarks that Eusebius seems to be thinking of a
spontaneous combustion. It was quite the fashion in the early Church to
tell dreadful tales in connection with the deaths of the persecutors,
but in the present case exaggeration is hardly necessary, for it would
seem from Lactantius’ account, that he died not of poison, as he states,
but of delirium tremens. As Mason remarks, “It is probable that Maximin
died of nothing worse than a natural death. But the death which was
natural to him was the most dreadful perhaps that men can die. Maximin
was known as an habitual drunkard; and in his dying delirium he is said
to have cried out that he saw God, with assessors, all in white robes,
judging him.”
