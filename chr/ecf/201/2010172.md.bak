<span id="iii.xi.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xi.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II</span>.—*The Training of Origen
from Childhood.* <span id="fr_1766"></span>[1767](#fn_1766.md)

<span id="iii.xi.ii-p3"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xi.ii-p3.1"></span>Many</span> things might be said in
attempting to describe the life of the man while in school; but this
subject alone would require a separate treatise. Nevertheless, for the
present, abridging most things, we shall state a few facts concerning
him as briefly as possible, gathering them from certain letters, and
from the statement of persons still living who were acquainted with him.

<span id="iii.xi.ii-p4"></span>2. What they report of Origen seems to me
worthy of mention, even, so to speak, from his swathing-bands.

<span id="iii.xi.ii-p5"></span>It was the tenth year of the reign of
Severus, <span id="page_250">p. 250</span> <span
id="iii.xi.ii-Page_250"></span>while Lætus <span
id="fr_1767"></span>[1768](#fn_1767.md) was governor of Alexandria and the
rest of Egypt, and Demetrius <span id="fr_1768"></span>[1769](#fn_1768.md)
had lately received the episcopate of the parishes there, as successor
of Julian. <span id="fr_1769"></span>[1770](#fn_1769.md)

<span id="iii.xi.ii-p9"></span>3. As the flame of persecution had been
kindled greatly, <span id="fr_1770"></span>[1771](#fn_1770.md) and
multitudes had gained the crown of martyrdom, such desire for martyrdom
seized the soul of Origen, although yet a boy, that he went close to
danger, springing forward and rushing to the conflict in his eagerness.

<span id="iii.xi.ii-p11"></span>4. And truly the termination of his life
had been very near had not the divine and heavenly Providence, for the
benefit of many, prevented his desire through the agency of his mother.

<span id="iii.xi.ii-p12"></span>5. For, at first, entreating him, she
begged him to have compassion on her motherly feelings toward him; but
finding, that when he had learned that his father had been seized and
imprisoned, he was set the more resolutely, and completely carried away
with his zeal for martyrdom, she hid all his clothing, and thus
compelled him to remain at home.

<span id="iii.xi.ii-p13"></span>6. But, as there was nothing else that
he could do, and his zeal beyond his age would not suffer him to be
quiet, he sent to his father an encouraging letter on martyrdom, <span
id="fr_1771"></span>[1772](#fn_1771.md) in which he exhorted him, saying,
“Take heed not to change your mind on our account.” This may be recorded
as the first evidence of Origen’s youthful wisdom and of his genuine
love for piety.

<span id="iii.xi.ii-p15"></span>7. For even then he had stored up no
small resources in the words of the faith, having been trained in the
Divine Scriptures from childhood. And he had not studied them with
indifference, for his father, besides giving him the usual liberal
education, <span id="fr_1772"></span>[1773](#fn_1772.md) had made them a
matter of no secondary importance.

<span id="iii.xi.ii-p17"></span>8. First of all, before inducting him
into the Greek sciences, he drilled him in sacred studies, requiring him
to learn and recite every day.

<span id="iii.xi.ii-p18"></span>9. Nor was this irksome to the boy, but
he was eager and diligent in these studies. And he was not satisfied
with learning what was simple and obvious in the sacred words, but
sought for something more, and even at that age busied himself with
deeper speculations. So that he puzzled his father with inquiries for
the true meaning of the inspired Scriptures.

<span id="iii.xi.ii-p19"></span>10. And his father rebuked him seemingly
to his face, telling him not to search beyond his age, or further than
the manifest meaning. But by himself he rejoiced greatly and thanked
God, the author of all good, that he had deemed him worthy to be the
father of such a child.

<span id="iii.xi.ii-p20"></span>11. And they say that often, standing by
the boy when asleep, he uncovered his breast as if the Divine Spirit
were enshrined within it, and kissed it reverently; considering himself
blessed in his goodly offspring. These and other things like them are
related of Origen when a boy.

<span id="iii.xi.ii-p21"></span>12. But when his father ended his life
in martyrdom, he was left with his mother and six younger brothers when
he was not quite seventeen years old. <span
id="fr_1773"></span>[1774](#fn_1773.md)

<span id="iii.xi.ii-p23"></span>13. And the property of his father being
confiscated to the royal treasury, he and his family were in want of the
necessaries of life. But he was deemed worthy of Divine care. And he
found welcome and rest with a woman of great wealth, and distinguished
in her manner of life and in other respects. She was treating with great
honor a famous heretic then in Alexandria; <span
id="fr_1774"></span>[1775](#fn_1774.md) who, however, was born in Antioch.
He was with her as an adopted son, and she treated him with the greatest
kindness.

<span id="iii.xi.ii-p25"></span>14. But although Origen was under the
necessity of associating with him, he nevertheless gave from this time
on strong evidences of his orthodoxy in the faith. For when on account
of the apparent skill in argument <span
id="fr_1775"></span>[1776](#fn_1775.md) of Paul,—for this was the man’s
name,—a great multitude came to him, not only of heretics but also of
our people, Origen could never be induced to join with him in
prayer; <span id="fr_1776"></span>[1777](#fn_1776.md) for he held, although
a boy, the rule of the Church, <span
id="fr_1777"></span>[1778](#fn_1777.md) and abominated, as he somewhere
expresses it, heretical teachings. <span
id="fr_1778"></span>[1779](#fn_1778.md) Having been instructed in the
sciences of the Greeks by his father, he <span id="page_251">p.
251</span> <span id="iii.xi.ii-Page_251"></span>devoted him after his
death more assiduously and exclusively to the study of literature, so
that he obtained considerable preparation in philology <span
id="fr_1779"></span>[1780](#fn_1779.md) and was able not long after the
death of his father, by devoting himself to that subject, to earn a
compensation amply sufficient for his needs at his age. <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1766"></span>[249:1767](2010172.htm#fr_1766.md) <span
id="iii.xi.ii-p1.2"></span>

<span id="iii.xi.ii-p2"></span> This sixth book of Eusebius’ *History*
is our chief source for a knowledge of Origen’s life. His own writings
give us little information of a personal nature; but Eusebius was in a
position to learn a great deal about him. He had the advantage of
personal converse with surviving friends of Origen, as he tells us in
this connection; he had also a large collection of Origen’s epistles (he
had himself made a collection of more than one hundred of them, as he
tells us in chap. 36); and he had access besides to official documents,
and to works of Origen’s contemporaries which contained references to
him (see chap. 33). As a result, he was in a position to write a full
and accurate account of his life, and in fact, in connection with
Pamphilus, he did write a *Defense of Origen* in six books, which
contained both an exposition of his theology with a refutation of
charges brought against him, and a full account of his life. Of this
work only the first book is extant, and that in the translation of
Rufinus. It deals solely with theological matters. It is greatly to be
regretted that the remaining books are lost, for they must have
contained much of the greatest interest in connection with Origen’s
life, especially that period of it about which we are most poorly
informed, his residence in Cæsarea after his retirement from Alexandria
(see chap. 23). In the present book Eusebius gives numerous details of
Origen’s life, frequently referring to the *Defense* for fuller
particulars. His account is very desultory, being interspersed with
numerous notices of other men and events, introduced apparently without
any method, though undoubtedly the design was to preserve in general the
chronological order. There is no part of Eusebius’ work which reveals
more clearly the viciousness of the purely chronological method breaking
up as it does the account of a single person or movement into numerous
detached pieces, and thus utterly destroying all historical continuity.
It may be well, therefore, to sum up in brief outline the chief events
of Origen’s life, most of which are scattered through the following
pages. This summary will be found below, on p. 391 sq. In addition to
the notices contained in this book, we have a few additional details
from the *Defense,* which have been preserved by Jerome, Rufinus, and
Photius, none of whom seems to have had much, if any, independent
knowledge of Origen’s life. Epiphanius (*Hær.* LXIII, and LXIV.) relates
some anecdotes of doubtful credibility. The *Panegyric* of Gregory
Thaumaturgus is valuable as a description of Origen’s method of
teaching, and of the wonderful influence which he possessed over his
pupils. (For outline of Origen’s life, see below, p. 391 sq.)

<span id="fn_1767"></span>[250:1768](2010172.htm#fr_1767.md) <span
id="iii.xi.ii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xi.ii-p6"></span> This Lætus is to be distinguished from
Q. Æmilius Lætus, prætorian prefect under Commodus, who was put to death
by the Emperor Didius Julianus, in 193; and from Julius Lætus, minister
of Severus, who was executed in 199 (see Dion Cassius, Bk. LXXIII. chap.
16, and LXXV. chap. 10; cf. Tillemont, *Hist. des emp.* III. p. 21, 55,
and 58). The dates of Lætus’ rule in Egypt are unknown to us.

particularly chap. 1, note 1.

<span id="fn_1771"></span>[250:1772](2010172.htm#fr_1771.md) <span
id="iii.xi.ii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xi.ii-p14"></span> This epistle which was apparently
extant in the time of Eusebius, and may have been contained in the
collection made by him (see chap. 36), is now lost, and we possess only
this sentence from it.

<span id="fn_1772"></span>[250:1773](2010172.htm#fr_1772.md) <span

<span id="iii.xi.ii-p16"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xi.ii-p16.1"></span>τῇ τῶν ἐγκυκλίων παιδεί& 139·</span>.
According to Liddell and Scott, <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xi.ii-p16.2"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xi.ii-p16.3"></span>γκ. παιδεία</span> in later Greek meant
“*the circle of those arts and sciences* which every free-born youth in
Greece was obliged to go through before applying to any professional
studies; *school learning,* as opposed to the business of life.” So
Valesius says that the Greeks understood by <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xi.ii-p16.4"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xi.ii-p16.5"></span>γκ. μαθήματα</span> the branches in which
the youth were instructed; i.e. mathematics, grammar, and rhetoric
philosophy not being included (see Valesius’ note *in loco*).

id="iii.xi.ii-p23.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xi.ii-p24"></span> Of this Antiochene heretic Paul we know
only what Eusebius tells us here. His patroness seems to have been a
Christian, and in good standing in the Alexandrian church, or Origen
would hardly have made his home with her.

<span id="iii.xi.ii-p27"></span> Redepenning (p. 189) refers to Origen’s
*In Matt. Comment. Series,* sec. 89, where it is said, *melius est cum
nullo orare, quam cum malis orare.*

<span id="fn_1777"></span>[250:1778](2010172.htm#fr_1777.md) <span

the words of the *Apostolic Constitutions,* VIII. 34: “Let not one of
the faithful pray with a catechumen, no, not in the house; for it is not
reasonable that he who is admitted should be polluted with one not
admitted. Let not one of the godly pray with an heretic, no, not in the
house. For ‘what fellowship hath light with darkness?’” Compare also the
*Apostolic Canons,* 11, 12, and 45. The last reads: “Let a bishop, or
presbyter, or deacon, who only prays with heretics, be suspended; but if
he also permit them to perform any part of the office of a clergyman,
let him be deprived.” Hefele (*Conciliengesch.* I. p. 815) considers
this canon only a “consistent application of apostolic principles to
particular cases,—an application which was made from the first century
on, and therefore very old.”

<span id="iii.xi.ii-p29"></span> Redepenning (p. 190) refers to the
remarks of Origen upon the nature and destructiveness of heresy
collected by Pamphilus (*Fragm. Apol. Pamph.* Opp. Origen, IV. 694 \[ed.
Delarue\]).
