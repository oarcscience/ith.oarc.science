<span id="iv.vi.iii.xxxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.xxxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXIII</span>.—*How the Church
of our Saviour, the New Jerusalem prophesied of in Scripture, was
built.*

<span id="iv.vi.iii.xxxiii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.xxxiii-p2.1"></span>This</span> was the emperor’s letter;
and his directions were at once carried into effect. Accordingly, on the
very spot which witnessed the Saviour’s sufferings, a new Jerusalem was
constructed, over against the one so celebrated of old, which, since the
foul stain of guilt brought on it by the murder of the Lord, had
experienced the last extremity of desolation, the effect of Divine
judgment on its impious people. It was opposite this city that the
emperor now began to rear a monument to the Saviour’s victory over
death, with rich and lavish magnificence. And it may be that this was
that second and new Jerusalem spoken of in the predictions of the
prophets, <span id="fr_3265"></span>[3266](#fn_3265.md) concerning which
such abundant testimony is given in the divinely inspired records.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.xxxiii-p4"></span>First of all, then, he adorned the
sacred cave itself, as the chief part of the whole work, and the
hallowed monument at which the angel radiant with light had once
declared to all that regeneration which was first manifested in the
Saviour’s person.

Jerusalem, coming down from God, out of heaven” &c.; an extraordinary,
nay, almost ludicrous application of Scripture, though perhaps
characteristic of the author’s age.—*Bag.*\] And it may be said
characteristic of Eusebius himself, for it is not his only sin in this
regard.
