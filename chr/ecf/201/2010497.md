<span id="iv.vi.ii.lii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.lii-p1.1"></span>Chapter LII</span>.—*The Manifold Forms of
Torture and Punishment practiced against the Christians.*

<span id="iv.vi.ii.lii-p2"></span>“<span class="c13"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.lii-p2.1"></span>Then</span>, indeed, one might see with
what arrogance those venerable worshipers of God were daily exposed,
with continued and relentless cruelty, to outrages of the most grievous
kind, and how that modesty of character <span
id="fr_3199"></span>[3200](#fn_3199.md) which no enemy had ever treated
with disrespect, became the mere sport of their infuriated
fellow-citizens. Is there any punishment by fire, are there any tortures
or forms of torment, which were not applied to all, without distinction
of age or sex? Then, it may be truly said, the earth shed tears, the
all-encircling compass of heaven mourned because of the pollution of
blood; and the very light of day itself was darkened in grief at the
spectacle.
