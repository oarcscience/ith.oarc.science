id="iv.vi.iv.xlvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLVII</span>.—*That the Council
at Nicæa was held in the Twentieth, the Dedication of the Church at
Jerusalem in the Thirtieth, Year of Constantine’s Reign.*

<span id="iv.vi.iv.xlvii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.xlvii-p2.1"></span>This</span> second synod the emperor
convened at Jerusalem, being the greatest of which we have any
knowledge, next to the first which he had summoned at the famous
Bithynian city. That indeed was a triumphal assembly, held in the
twentieth year of his reign, an occasion of thanksgiving for victory
over his enemies in the very city which bears the name of victory. <span
id="fr_3344"></span>[3345](#fn_3344.md) The present meeting added luster to
the thirtieth anniversary, during which the emperor dedicated the church
at the sepulchre of our Saviour, as a peace-offering to God, the giver
of all good.
