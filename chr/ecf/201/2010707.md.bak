<span id="iv.viii.xviii"></span>

<span id="iv.viii.xviii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.viii.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVII.</span>

<span id="iv.viii.xviii-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iv.viii.xviii-p2.1"></span>And</span> now the time is come for us to
consider the works of our Saviour in our own age, and to contemplate the
living operations of the living God. For how shall we describe these
mighty works save as living proofs of the power of a living agent, who
truly enjoys the life of God? If any one inquire the nature of these
works, let him now attend.

<span id="iv.viii.xviii-p3"></span>2. But recently a class of persons,
impelled by furious zeal, and backed by equal power and military force,
evinced their enmity against God, by destroying his churches, and
overthrowing from their foundations the buildings dedicated to his
worship. In short, in every way they directed their attacks against the
unseen God, and assailed him with a thousand shafts of impious words.
But he who is invisible avenged himself with an invisible hand.

<span id="iv.viii.xviii-p4"></span>3. By the single fiat of his will his
enemies were utterly destroyed, they who a little while before had been
flourishing in great prosperity, exalted by their fellow men as worthy
of divine honor, and blessed with a continued period of power and
glory, <span id="fr_3577"></span>[3578](#fn_3577.md) so long as they had
maintained peace and amity with him whom they afterwards opposed. As
soon, however, as they dared openly to resist his will, and to set their
gods in array against him whom we adore; immediately, according to the
will and power of that God against whom their arms were raised, they all
received the judgment due to their audacious deeds. Constrained to yield
and flee before his power, together they acknowledged his Divine nature,
and hastened to reverse the measures which they had before essayed.

<span id="iv.viii.xviii-p6"></span>4. Our Saviour, therefore, without
delay erected trophies of this victory everywhere, and once more adorned
the world with holy temples and consecrated houses of prayer; in every
city and village, nay, throughout all countries, and even in barbaric
wilds, ordaining the erection of churches and sacred buildings to the
honor of the Supreme God and Lord of all. Hence it is that these
hallowed edifices are deemed worthy to bear his name, and receive not
their appellation from men, but from the Lord himself, from which
circumstances they are called churches (or houses of the Lord). <span
id="fr_3578"></span>[3579](#fn_3578.md)

<span id="iv.viii.xviii-p8"></span>5. And now let him who will stand
forth and tell us who, after so complete a desolation, has restored
these sacred buildings from foundation to roof? Who, when all hope
appeared extinct, has caused them to rise on a nobler scale than
heretofore? And well may it claim our wonder, that this renovation was
not subsequent to the death of those adversaries of God, but whilst the
destroyers of these edifices were still alive; so that the recantation
of their evil deeds came in their own words and edicts. <span
id="fr_3579"></span>[3580](#fn_3579.md) And this they did, not in the
sunshine of prosperity and ease (for then we might suppose that
benevolence or clemency might be the cause), but at the very time that
they were suffering under the stroke of Divine vengeance.

<span id="iv.viii.xviii-p10"></span>6. Who, again, has been able to
retain in obedience to his heavenly precepts, after so many successive
storms of persecution, nay, in the very crisis of danger, so many
persons throughout the world devoted to philosophy, and the service of
God and those holy choirs of virgins who had dedicated themselves to a
life of perpetual chastity and purity? Who taught them cheerfully to
persevere in the exercise of protracted fasting, and to embrace a life
of severe and consistent self-denial? Who has persuaded multitudes of
either sex to devote themselves to the study of sacred things, and
prefer to bodily nutriment that intellectual food which is suited to the
wants of a rational soul? <span id="fr_3580"></span>[3581](#fn_3580.md) Who
has instructed barbarians and peasants, yea, feeble women, slaves, and
children, in short, unnumbered multitudes of all nations, to live in the
contempt of death; persuaded of the immortality of their souls,
conscious that human actions are observed by the unerring eye of
justice, expecting God’s award to the righteous and the wicked, and
therefore true to the practice of a just and virtuous life? For they
could not otherwise have persevered in the course of godliness. Surely
these are the acts which our Saviour, and he alone, even now performs.

<span id="iv.viii.xviii-p12"></span>7. And now let us pass from these
topics, and endeavor by inquiries such as these that follow to convince
the objector’s obdurate understanding. Come forward, then, whoever thou
art, and speak the words of reason: utter, not the thoughts of a
senseless heart, but those of an intelligent and enlightened mind:
speak, I say, after deep solemn converse with thyself. Who of the sages
whose names have yet been known to fame, has ever been fore-known and
proclaimed from the remotest ages, as our Saviour was by the prophetic
oracles to the once divinely-favored Hebrew nation? But <span
id="page_609">p. 609</span> <span id="iv.viii.xviii-Page_609"></span>his
very birth-place, the period of his advent the manner of his life, his
miracles, and words and mighty acts, were anticipated and recorded in
the sacred volumes of these prophets.

<span id="iv.viii.xviii-p13"></span>8. Again, who so present an avenger
of crimes against himself; so that, as the immediate consequence of
their impiety, the entire Jewish people were scattered by an unseen
power, their royal seat utterly removed, and their very temple with its
holy things levelled with the ground? Who, like our Saviour, has uttered
predictions at once concerning that impious nation and the establishment
of his church throughout the world, and has equally verified both by the
event? Respecting the temple of these wicked men, our Saviour said:
“Your house is left unto you desolate”: <span
id="fr_3581"></span>[3582](#fn_3581.md) and, “There shall not be left one
stone upon another in this place, that shall not be thrown down.” <span
id="fr_3582"></span>[3583](#fn_3582.md) And again, of his church he says:
“I will build my church upon a rock, and the gates of hell shall not
prevail against it.” <span id="fr_3583"></span>[3584](#fn_3583.md)

<span id="iv.viii.xviii-p17"></span>9. How wondrous, too, must that
power be deemed which summoned obscure and unlettered men from their
fisher’s trade, and made them the legislators and instructors of the
human race! And how clear a demonstration of his deity do we find in the
promise so well performed, that he would make them fishers of men: in
the power and energy which he bestowed, so that they composed and
published writings of such authority that they were translated into
every civilized and barbarous language, <span
id="fr_3584"></span>[3585](#fn_3584.md) were read and pondered by all
nations, and the doctrines contained in them accredited as the oracles
of God!

<span id="iv.viii.xviii-p19"></span>10. How marvelous his predictions of
the future, and the testimony whereby his disciples were forewarned that
they should be brought before kings and rulers, and should endure the
severest punishments, not indeed as criminals, but simply for their
confession of his name! Or who shall adequately describe the power with
which he prepared them thus to suffer with a willing mind, and enabled
them, strong in the armor of godliness, to maintain a constancy of
spirit indomitable in the midst of conflict?

<span id="iv.viii.xviii-p20"></span>11. Or how shall we enough admire
that steadfast firmness of soul which strengthened, not merely his
immediate followers, but their successors also, even to our present age,
in the joyful endurance of every infliction, and every form of torture,
in proof of their devotion to the Supreme God? Again, what monarch has
prolonged his government through so vast a series of ages? Who else has
power to make war after death, to triumph over every enemy, to subjugate
each barbarous and civilized nation and city, and to subdue his
adversaries with an invisible and secret hand?

<span id="iv.viii.xviii-p21"></span>12. Lastly, and chief of all, what
slanderous lip shall dare to question that universal peace to which we
have already referred; established by his power throughout the
world? <span id="fr_3585"></span>[3586](#fn_3585.md) For thus the mutual
concord and harmony of all nations coincided in point of time with the
extension of our Saviour’s doctrine and preaching in all the world: a
concurrence of events predicted in long ages past by the prophets of
God. The day itself would fail me, gracious emperor, should I attempt to
exhibit in a single view those cogent proofs of our Saviour’s Divine
power which even now are visible in their effects; for no human being,
in civilized or barbarous nations, has ever yet exhibited such power of
Divine virtue as our Saviour.

<span id="iv.viii.xviii-p23"></span>13. But why do I speak of men, since
of the beings whom all nations have deemed divine, none has appeared on
earth with power like to his? If there has, let the fact now be proved.
Come forward, ye philosophers, and tell us what god or hero has yet been
known to fame, who has delivered the doctrines of eternal life and a
heavenly kingdom as he has done who is our Saviour? Who, like him, has
persuaded multitudes throughout the world to pursue the principles of
Divine wisdom, to fix their hope on heaven itself, and look forward to
the mansions there reserved for them that love God? What god or hero in
human form has ever held his course from the rising to the setting sun,
a course co-extensive as it were with the solar light, and irradiated
mankind with the bright and glorious beams of his doctrine, causing each
nation of the earth to render united worship to the One true God? What
god or hero yet, as he has done, has set aside all gods and heroes among
civilized or barbarous nations; has ordained that divine honors should
be withheld from all, and claimed obedience to that command: and then,
though singly conflicting with the power of all, has utterly destroyed
the opposing hosts; victorious over the gods and heroes of every age,
and causing himself alone, in every region of the habitable world, to be
acknowledged by all people as the only Son of God?

<span id="iv.viii.xviii-p24"></span>14. Who else has commanded the
nations inhabiting the continents and islands of this mighty globe to
assemble weekly on the Lord’s day, and to observe it as a festival, not
indeed for the pampering of the body, but for the invigoration of the
soul by instruction in Divine truth? What god or hero, exposed, as our
Saviour was, to so sore a conflict, has raised <span id="page_610">p.
610</span> <span id="iv.viii.xviii-Page_610"></span>the trophy of
victory over every foe? For they indeed, from first to last, unceasingly
assailed his doctrine and his people: but he who is invisible, by the
exercise of a secret power, has raised his servants and the sacred
houses of their worship to the height of glory.

<span id="iv.viii.xviii-p25"></span>But why should we still vainly aim
at detailing those Divine proofs of our Saviour’s power which no
language can worthily express; which need indeed no words of ours, but
themselves appeal in loudest tones to those whose mental ears are open
to the truth? Surely it is a strange, a wondrous fact, unparalleled in
the annals of human life; that the blessings we have described should be
accorded to our mortal race, and that he who is in truth the only, the
eternal Son of God, should thus be visible on earth.
