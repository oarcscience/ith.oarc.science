id="iv.vi.i.xxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXV</span>.—*Victories of
Constantine over the Barbarians and the Britons.*

<span id="iv.vi.i.xxv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.xxv-p2.1"></span>As</span> soon then as he was established
on the throne, he began to care for the interests of his paternal
inheritance, and visited with much considerate kindness all those
provinces which had previously been under his father’s government. Some
tribes of the barbarians who dwelt on the banks of the Rhine, and the
shores of the Western ocean, having ventured to revolt, he reduced them
all to obedience, and brought them from their savage state to one of
gentleness. He contented himself with checking the inroads of others,
and drove from his dominions, like untamed and savage beasts, those whom
he perceived to be altogether incapable of the settled order of
civilized life. <span id="fr_3100"></span>[3101](#fn_3100.md) Having
disposed of these affairs to his satisfaction, he directed his attention
to other quarters of the world, and first passed over to the British
nations, <span id="fr_3101"></span>[3102](#fn_3101.md) which lie in the
very bosom of the ocean. These he reduced to submission, and then
proceeded to consider the state of the remaining portions of the empire,
that he might be ready to tender his aid wherever circumstances might
require it.

<span id="iv.vi.i.xxv-p4"></span> \[Eusebius here speaks of a *second*
expedition of Constantine to Britain, which is not mentioned by other
ancient writers; or he may have been forgetful or ignorant of the fact
that Constantine had received the imperial authority in Britain itself,
Constantius having died in his palace at York, <span class="c13"><span
id="iv.vi.i.xxv-p4.1"></span>a.d.</span> 306. Vide Gibbon’s *Decline and
Fall,* chap. 14.—*Bag.*\] It seems to be a part of the confusion about
his crossing to Britain in the first place.
