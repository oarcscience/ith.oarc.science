id="iv.vi.i.liii-p1.1"></span>Chapter LIII</span>.—*Edict that Women
should not meet with the Men in the Churches.*

<span id="iv.vi.i.liii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.liii-p2.1"></span>Accordingly</span> he passed a second law,
which enjoined that men should not appear in company with women in the
houses of prayer, and forbade women to attend the sacred schools of
virtue, or to receive instruction from the bishops, directing the
appointment of women to be teachers of their own sex. These regulations
being received with general ridicule, he devised other means for
effecting the ruin of the churches. He ordered that the usual
congregations of the people should be held in the open country outside
the gates, alleging that the open air without the city was far more
suitable for a multitude than the houses of prayer within the walls.
