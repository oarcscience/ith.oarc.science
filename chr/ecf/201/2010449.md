<span id="iv.vi.ii.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV</span>.—*That Constantine
prepared himself for the War by Prayer: Licinius by the Practice of
Divination.*

<span id="iv.vi.ii.iv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.iv-p2.1"></span>He</span> took with him also the priests of
God, feeling well assured that now, if ever, he stood in need of the
efficacy of prayer, and thinking it right that they should constantly be
near and about his person, as most trusty guardians of the soul.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.iv-p3"></span>Now, as soon as the tyrant understood
that Constantine’s victories over his enemies were secured to him by no
other means than the cooperation of God, and that the persons above
alluded to were continually with him and about his person; and besides
this, that the symbol of the salutary passion preceded both the emperor
himself and his whole army; he regarded these precautions with ridicule
(as might be expected), at the same time mocking and reviling the
emperor with blasphemous words.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.iv-p4"></span>On the other hand, he gathered round
himself Egyptian diviners and soothsayers, with sorcerers and
enchanters, and the priests and prophets of those whom he imagined to be
gods. He then, after offering the sacrifices which he thought the
occasion demanded, enquired how far he might reckon on a successful
termination of the war. They replied with one voice, that he would
unquestionably be victorious over his enemies, and triumphant in the
war: and the oracles everywhere held out to him the same prospect in
copious and elegant verses. The soothsayers certified him of favorable
omens from the flight of birds; the priests <span
id="fr_3163"></span>[3164](#fn_3163.md) declared the same to be indicated
by the motion of the entrails of their victims. Elevated, therefore, by
these fallacious assurances, he boldly advanced at the head of his army,
and prepared for battle.

technically “augurs” and “haruspices.” Compare for their functions the
articles *Augur,* *Divinatio,* and *Haruspices,* in Smith, *Dict. Gr.
