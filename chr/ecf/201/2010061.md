id="iii.vii.xx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIX.—</span>*The Calamity which
befell the Jews in Jerusalem on the Day of the Passover.*

<span id="iii.vii.xx-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.vii.xx-p2.1"></span>While</span> Claudius was still emperor, it
happened that so great a tumult and disturbance took place in Jerusalem
at the feast of the Passover, that thirty thousand of those Jews alone
who were forcibly crowded together at the gate of the temple
perished, <span id="fr_453"></span>[454](#fn_453.md) being trampled under
foot by one another. Thus the festival became a season of mourning for
all the nation, and there was weeping in every house. These things are
related literally <span id="fr_454"></span>[455](#fn_454.md) by Josephus.

<span id="iii.vii.xx-p5"></span>2. But Claudius appointed Agrippa, <span
id="fr_455"></span>[456](#fn_455.md) son of Agrippa, king of the Jews,
having sent Felix <span id="fr_456"></span>[457](#fn_456.md) as procurator
of the whole country of Samaria and Galilee, and of the land called
Perea. <span id="fr_457"></span>[458](#fn_457.md) And after he had reigned
thirteen years and eight months <span id="fr_458"></span>[459](#fn_458.md)
he died, and left Nero as his successor in the empire.

<span id="iii.vii.xx-p3"></span> This disturbance (described by Jos. *B.
J.* II. 12. 1, and *Ant.* XX. 5. 3) took place in 48 <span
class="c13"><span id="iii.vii.xx-p3.1"></span>a.d.</span> while Cumanus
was procurator of Judea. During the Passover feast the procurator, as
was the custom, brought extra troops to Jerusalem to guard against any
uproar which might arise among the great mass of people. One of the
soldiers, with the view of insulting the Jews, conducted himself
indecently in their presence, whereupon so great an uproar arose that
the procurator felt obliged to collect his troops upon the temple hill,
but the appearance of the soldiers so greatly alarmed the multitude
assembled there that they fled in all directions and crushed each other
to death in their eagerness to escape. Josephus, in his *Jewish War,*
gives the number of the slain as ten thousand, and in the *Antiquities*
as twenty thousand. The latter work was written last, but knowing
Josephus’ fondness for exaggerating numbers, we shall perhaps not accept
the correction as any nearer the truth. That Eusebius gives thirty
thousand need not arouse suspicion as to his honesty,—he could have had
no object for changing “twenty” to “thirty,” when the former was
certainly great enough,—we need simply remember how easily numbers
become altered in transcription. Valesius says that this disturbance
took place under Quadratus in 52 <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.vii.xx-p3.2"></span>a.d.</span> (quoting Pearson’s *Ann. Paull.*
p. 11 sqq., and Tacitus, *Ann.* XII. 54). But Eusebius, in his *Chron.,*
gives the eighth year of Claudius (48 <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.vii.xx-p3.3"></span>a.d.</span>), and Orosius, VII. 4, gives the
seventh year. Jost and Ewald agree with Eusebius in regard to the date.

<span id="fn_454"></span>[122:455](2010061.htm#fr_454.md) <span
id="iii.vii.xx-p3.4"></span>

<span id="iii.vii.xx-p4"></span> Eusebius simply sums up in the one
sentence what fills half a page in Josephus.

<span id="fn_455"></span>[122:456](2010061.htm#fr_455.md) <span
id="iii.vii.xx-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vii.xx-p6"></span> Herod Agrippa II., son of Herod Agrippa
I. At the time of his father’s death (44 <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.vii.xx-p6.1"></span>a.d.</span>) he was but seventeen years of
age, and his youth deterred Claudius from giving him the kingdom of his
father, which was therefore again converted into a Roman province, and
Fadus was sent as procurator. In 49 <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.vii.xx-p6.2"></span>a.d.</span> Agrippa was given the kingdom of
Chalcis which had belonged to his uncle Herod (a brother of Agrippa I.),
and in 53 <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.vii.xx-p6.3"></span>a.d.</span> he was transferred to the
tetrarchies of Philip and Lysanias with the title of King. He was never
king of the Jews in the same sense in which his father was, as Judea
remained a Roman province throughout his reign, while his dominion
comprised only the northeastern part of Palestine. He enjoyed, however,
the right of appointing and removing the high priests, and under Nero
his domain was somewhat increased by the addition of several cities of
Galilee, and Perea. He sided with the Romans in the Jewish war, and
afterwards went to Rome, where he died in 100 <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.vii.xx-p6.4"></span>a.d.</span>, the last prince of the Herodian
line. It was before this Agrippa that Paul made his defense recorded in
[Acts xxvi](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#000.md)<span
id="iii.vii.xx-p6.5"></span>.

<span id="fn_456"></span>[122:457](2010061.htm#fr_456.md) <span
id="iii.vii.xx-p6.6"></span>

<span id="iii.vii.xx-p7"></span> Felix, a freedman of Claudius,
succeeded Cumanus as procurator of Judea in 52 (or, according to
Wieseler, 53) <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.vii.xx-p7.1"></span>a.d.</span> The territory over which he
ruled included Samaria and the greater part of Galilee and Perea, to
which Judea was added by Nero, according to Josephus, *B. J.* II. 13. 2.
Ewald, in the attempt to reconcile Tacitus, *Ann.* XII. 54, and
Josephus, *Ant.* XX. 5. 2–7. 1,—the former of whom makes Cumanus and
Felix contemporary procurators, each over a part of the province, while
the latter makes Felix the successor of Cumanus,—concludes that Felix
was sent to Judea as the assistant of Cumanus, and became procurator
upon the banishment of the latter. This is not impossible, though we
have no testimony to support it. Compare Wieseler, p. 67, note. Between
59 and 61 (according to Wieseler, in 60; see chap. 22, note 1, below) he
was succeeded by Porcius Festus. For the relations of these two
procurators to the apostle Paul, see [Acts
xx](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#000.md)<span id="iii.vii.xx-p7.2"></span>.
sqq. Eusebius, in his *Chron.,* puts the accession of Felix in the
eleventh year of Claudius (51 <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.vii.xx-p7.3"></span>a.d.</span>), and the accession of Festus in
the fourteenth year (54 <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.vii.xx-p7.4"></span>a.d.</span>), but both of these dates are
clearly incorrect (cf. Wieseler, p. 68, note).

<span id="fn_457"></span>[122:458](2010061.htm#fr_457.md) <span
id="iii.vii.xx-p7.5"></span>

<span id="iii.vii.xx-p8"></span> Eusebius evidently supposed the Roman
province at this time to have been limited to Samaria, Galilee, and
Perea; but in this he was wrong, for it included also Judea (see
preceding note), Agrippa II. having under him only the tetrarchies
mentioned above (note 3) and a few cities of Galilee and Perea. He had,
however, the authority over the temple and the power of appointing the
high priests (see Jos. *Ant.* XX. 8. 11 and 9. 1, 4, 6, 7), which had
been given by Claudius to his uncle, the king of Chalcis (Jos. *Ant.*
XX. 1. 3).

<span id="fn_458"></span>[122:459](2010061.htm#fr_458.md) <span
id="iii.vii.xx-p8.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vii.xx-p9"></span> Claudius ruled from Jan. 24, 41 <span
class="c13"><span id="iii.vii.xx-p9.1"></span>a.d.</span>, to Oct. 13,
54.
