Adulterous Conduct of Maxentius at Rome.* <span

<span id="iv.vi.i.xxxiii-p3"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.xxxiii-p3.1"></span>For</span> he who had tyrannically
possessed himself of the imperial city, <span
id="fr_3117"></span>[3118](#fn_3117.md) had proceeded to great lengths in
impiety and wickedness, so as to venture without hesitation on every
vile and impure action.

<span id="iv.vi.i.xxxiii-p5"></span>For example: he would separate women
from their husbands, and after a time send them back to them again, and
these insults he offered not to men of mean or obscure condition, but to
those who held the first places in the Roman senate. Moreover, though he
shamefully dishonored almost numberless free women, he was unable to
satisfy his ungoverned and intemperate desires. But <span
id="fr_3118"></span>[3119](#fn_3118.md) when he assayed to corrupt
Christian women also, he could no longer secure success to his designs,
since they chose rather to submit their lives <span
id="fr_3119"></span>[3120](#fn_3119.md) to death than yield their persons
to be defiled by him.

<span id="iv.vi.i.xxxiii-p6"></span> “For” seems to express the author’s
real meaning, but both punctuation of editors and renderings of
translators insist on “but.”

<span id="iv.vi.i.xxxiii-p7"></span> Various readings of text add
“lawfully married” women, and send them back again “grievously
dishonored,” and so *Bag.,* but Heinichen has this reading. Compare note
of Heinichen.
