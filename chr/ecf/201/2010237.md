id="iii.xii.xx-p2.1"></span>The</span> chair of James, who first
received the episcopate of the church at Jerusalem from the Saviour

who, as the divine records show, <span

been preserved until now, <span id="fr_2301"></span>[2302](#fn_2301.md) the
brethren who have followed him in succession there exhibiting clearly to
all the reverence which both those of old times and those of our own day
maintained and do maintain for holy men on account of their piety. So
much as to this matter.

<span id="iii.xii.xx-p3"></span> That James was appointed bishop of
Jerusalem by Christ himself was an old and wide-spread tradition.
Compare, e.g., the Clementine *Recognitions,* Bk. I. chap. 43, the
*Apostolic Constitutions,* Bk. VIII. chap. 35, and Chrysostom’s *Homily
XXXVII. on First Corinthians.* See Valesius’ note *ad locum;* and on the
universal tradition that James was bishop of Jerusalem, see above, Bk.
II. chap. 1, note 11.

On the actual relationship of “James, the Brother of the Lord” to
Christ, see Bk. I. chap. 12, note 14.

id="iii.xii.xx-p4.2"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.xx-p5"></span> There can be no doubt that a chair
(<span class="Greek"><span id="iii.xii.xx-p5.1"></span>θρόνος</span>),
said to be the episcopal seat of James, the first bishop of Jerusalem,
was shown in that church in the time of Eusebius, but there can be no
less doubt that it was not genuine. Even had James been bishop of
Jerusalem, and possessed a regular episcopal chair, or throne (a very
violent supposition, which involves a most glaring anachronism), it was
quite out of the question that it should have been preserved from
destruction at the fall of the city in 70 <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xii.xx-p5.2"></span>a.d.</span> As Stroth drily remarks: “Man
hatte auch wohl nichts wichtigeres zu retten, als einen Stuhl!” The
beginning of that veneration of relics which later took such strong hold
on the Church, and which still flourishes within the Greek and Roman
communions is clearly seen in this case recorded by Eusebius. At the
same time, we can hardly say that that superstitious veneration with
which we are acquainted appeared in this case. There seems to be nothing
more than the customary respect for an article of old and time-honored
associations which is seen everywhere and in all ages (cf. Heinichen’s
Excursus on this passage, Vol. III. p. 208 sq.). Crusè has unaccountably
rendered <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xii.xx-p5.3"></span>θρόνος</span> in this passage as if it
referred to the see of Jerusalem, not to the chair of the bishop. It is
plain enough that such an interpretation is quite unwarranted.
