ignominiously employed in the Mines and Public Works.*

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xxxii-p2"></span>“<span class="c13"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.xxxii-p2.1"></span>Again</span>, with regard to those who
have been condemned either to the grievous labor of the mines, or to
service in the public works, let them enjoy the sweets of leisure in
place of these long-continued toils, and henceforth lead a far easier
life, and more accordant with the wishes of their hearts, exchanging the
incessant hardships of their tasks for quiet relaxation. And if any have
forfeited the common privilege of liberty, or have unhappily suffered
dishonor, <span id="fr_3185"></span>[3186](#fn_3185.md) let them hasten
back every one to the country of his nativity, and resume with becoming
joy their former positions in society, from which they have been as it
were separated by long residence abroad.
