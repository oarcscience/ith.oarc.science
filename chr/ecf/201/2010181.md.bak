<span id="iii.xi.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xi.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI.—</span>*Alexander.*

<span id="iii.xi.xi-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xi.xi-p2.1"></span>But</span> as on account of his great age
Narcissus was no longer able to perform his official duties, <span
id="fr_1821"></span>[1822](#fn_1821.md) the Providence of God called to the
office with him, by a revelation given him in a night vision, the
above-mentioned Alexander, who was then bishop of another parish. <span
id="fr_1822"></span>[1823](#fn_1822.md)

<span id="iii.xi.xi-p5"></span><span id="page_257">p. 257</span> <span
id="iii.xi.xi-Page_257"></span>2. Thereupon, as by Divine direction, he
journeyed from the land of Cappadocia, where he first held the
episcopate, to Jerusalem, in consequence of a vow and for the sake of
information in regard to its places. <span
id="fr_1823"></span>[1824](#fn_1823.md) They received him there with great
cordiality, and would not permit him to return, because of another
revelation seen by them at night, which uttered the clearest message to
the most zealous among them. For it made known that if they would go
outside the gates, they would receive the bishop foreordained for them
by God. And having done this, with the unanimous consent of the bishops
of the neighboring churches, they constrained him to remain.

<span id="iii.xi.xi-p7"></span>3. Alexander, himself, in private letters
to the Antinoites, <span id="fr_1824"></span>[1825](#fn_1824.md) which are
still preserved among us, mentions the joint episcopate of Narcissus and
himself, writing in these words at the end of the epistle:

<span id="iii.xi.xi-p9"></span>4. “Narcissus salutes you, who held the
episcopate here before me, and is now associated with me in prayers,
being one hundred and sixteen years of age; and he exhorts you, as I do,
to be of one mind.”

<span id="iii.xi.xi-p10"></span>These things took place in this manner.
But, on the death of Serapion, <span
id="fr_1825"></span>[1826](#fn_1825.md) Asclepiades, <span
id="fr_1826"></span>[1827](#fn_1826.md) who had been himself distinguished
among the confessors <span id="fr_1827"></span>[1828](#fn_1827.md) during
the persecution, succeeded to the episcopate of the church at Antioch.
Alexander alludes to his appointment, writing thus to the church at
Antioch:

<span id="iii.xi.xi-p14"></span>5. “Alexander, a servant and prisoner of
Jesus Christ, to the blessed church of Antioch, greeting in the Lord.
The Lord hath made my bonds during the time of my imprisonment light and
easy, since I learned that, by the Divine Providence, Asclepiades, who
in regard to the true faith is eminently qualified, has undertaken the
bishopric of your holy church at Antioch.”

<span id="iii.xi.xi-p15"></span>6. He indicates that he sent this
epistle by Clement, <span id="fr_1828"></span>[1829](#fn_1828.md) writing
toward its close as follows:

<span id="iii.xi.xi-p17"></span>“My honored brethren, <span
id="fr_1829"></span>[1830](#fn_1829.md) I have sent this letter to you by
Clement, the blessed presbyter, a man virtuous and approved, whom ye
yourselves also know and will recognize. Being here, in the providence
and oversight of the Master, he has strengthened and built up the Church
of the Lord.”

<span id="fn_1821"></span>[256:1822](2010181.htm#fr_1821.md) <span
id="iii.xi.xi-p2.2"></span>

<span id="iii.xi.xi-p3"></span> The extreme age of Narcissus at this
time is evident from the fact that Alexander, writing before the year
216 (see note 4), says that Narcissus is already in his 116th year. The
translation of Alexander to Jerusalem must have taken place about 212
(see chap. 8, note 6), and hence Narcissus was now more than 110 years
old. The appointment of Alexander as Narcissus’ assistant involved two
acts which were even at that time not common, and which were later
forbidden by canon; first the translation of a bishop from one see to
another, and secondly the appointment of an assistant bishop, which made
two bishops in one city. The *Apost. Canons* (No. 14) ordain that “a
bishop ought not to leave his own parish and leap to another, although
the multitude should compel him, unless there be some good reason
forcing him to do this, as that he can contribute much greater profit to
the people of the new parish by the word of piety; but this is not to be
settled by himself, but by the judgment of many bishops and very great
supplication.” It has been disputed whether this canon is older or
younger than the fifteenth canon of Nicæa, which forbids unconditionally
the practice of translation from one see to another. Whichever may be
the older, it is certain that even the Council of Nicæa considered its
own canon as liable to exceptions in certain cases, for it translated
Eustathius from Beræa to Antioch (see Sozomen, *H. E.* I. 2). The truth
is, the rule was established—whether before or for the first time at the
Council of Nicæa—chiefly in order to guard against the ambition of
aspiring men who might wish to go from a smaller to a greater parish,
and to prevent, as the Nicene Canon says, the many disorders and
quarrels which the custom of translation caused; and a rule formed on
such grounds of expediency was of course liable to exception whenever
the good of the Church seemed to demand it, and therefore, whether the
fourteenth Apostolic Canon is more ancient than the Nicene Council or
not, it certainly embodies a principle which must long have been in
force, and which we find in fact acted upon in the present case; for the
translation of Alexander takes place “with the common consent of the
bishops of the neighboring churches,” or, as Jerome puts it, *cunctis in
Palestina episcopis in unum congregatis,* which is quite in accord with
the provision of the Apostolic Canons. There were some in the early
Church who thought it absolutely unlawful under any circumstances for a
bishop to be translated (cf. Jerome’s *Ep. ad Oceanum;* Migne, *Ep.* 69,
§5), but this was not the common view, as Bingham (*Antiq.* VI. 4. 6)
well observes, and instances of translation from one see to another were
during all these centuries common (cf. e.g. Socrates, *H. E.* VII. 36),
although always of course exceptional, and considered lawful only when
made for good and sufficient reasons. To say, therefore, with Valesius
that these Palestinian bishops violated a rule of the Church in
translating Alexander is too strong. They were evidently unconscious of
anything uncanonical, or even irregular in their action, though it is
clear that they regarded the step as too important to be taken without
the approval of all the bishops of the neighborhood. In regard to
assistant bishops, Valesius correctly remarks that this is the first
instance of the kind known to us, but it is by no means the only one,
for the following centuries furnish numerous examples; e.g. Theotecnus
and Anatolius in Cæsarea (see below, Bk. VII. chap. 32), Maximus and
Macarius in Jerusalem (see Sozomen, *H. E.* II. 20); and so in Africa
Valerius of Hippo had Augustine as his coadjutor (Possidius, *Vita.
Aug.* chap. 8; see Bingham’s *Antiq.* II. 13. 4 for other instances and
for a discussion of the whole subject). The principle was in force from
as early as the third century (see Cyprian to Cornelius, *Ep.* 40, *al.*
44 and to Antonianus, *Ep.* 51, *al.* 55) that there should be only one
bishop in a city, and we see from the works of various Fathers that this
rule was universally accepted at an early date. The eighth canon of
Nicæa refers to this principle in passing as if it were already firmly
established, and the council evidently did not think it necessary to
promulgate a special canon on the subject. Because of this principle,
Augustine hesitated to allow himself to be ordained assistant bishop of
Hippo; and although his scruples were overcome at the time, he
afterward, upon learning of the Nicene Canon, considered the practice of
having a coadjutor illegal and refused to ordain one for himself. But,
as the instances referred to above and many others show, not all the
Church interpreted the principle as rigidly as Augustine did, and hence
under certain circumstances exceptions were made to the rule, and were
looked upon throughout the Church as quite lawful. The existence of two
bishops in one city as a matter of compromise, for the sake of healing a
schism, formed one common exception to the general principle (see
Bingham, II. 13. 2), and the appointment of coadjutors, as in the
present case, formed another.

<span id="iii.xi.xi-p4"></span> Of what city in Cappadocia Alexander was
bishop we are not told by Eusebius, nor by our other ancient
authorities. Valesius (note on this passage) and Tillemont (*Hist.
eccles.* III. p. 415) give Flaviopolis or Flaviadis as the name of the
city (upon the authority of Basilicon, *Jur. Græco-Rom*. Tom. I. p. 295,
according to Tillemont). But Flaviopolis was a city of Cilicia, and
hence Tillemont conjectures that it had once been taken from Cappadocia
and attached to Cilicia, and that its inhabitants retained the memory of
Alexander, their early bishop. The report seems to rest upon a very
slender foundation; but not having access to the authority cited, I am
unable to form an opinion as to the worth of the tradition.

a city of Egypt founded by Hadrian in honor of Antinous (see Bk. IV.
chap. 8, note 3). This is the first mention of a church there, but its
bishops were present at more than one council in later centuries (see
Wiltsch’s *Geography and Statistics,* p. 59, 196, 473). This letter must
have been written between 212, at about which time Alexander became
Narcissus’ coadjutor (see chap. 8, note 6), and 216, when Origen visited
Palestine (see chap. 19, note 23). For at the time of that visit
Alexander is said to have been bishop of Jerusalem, and no mention is
made of Narcissus, who must therefore have been already dead (see Bk. V.
chap. 12, note 1). The fragments of Alexander’s epistles quoted in this
chapter are given in Routh’s *Rel. Sacræ,* II. p. 161 sq., and in
English in the *Ante-Nicene Fathers,* VI. p. 154.

<span id="iii.xi.xi-p12"></span> The *Chron.* puts the accession of
Asclepiades in the first year of Caracalla (211 <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xi.xi-p12.1"></span>a.d.</span>). Harnack (*Zeit des Ignatius,*
p. 47) believes that this notice rests upon better knowledge than the
notices of most of the Antiochian bishops, because in this case the
author departs from the artificial scheme which he follows in the main.
But Harnack contends that the date is not quite correct, because
Alexander, who suffered under Severus, was still in prison when
Asclepiades became bishop, and therefore the latter’s accession must be
put back into Severus’ reign. He would fix, therefore, upon about 209 as
the date of it, rightly perceiving that there is good reason for
thinking the *Chron.* at least nearly correct in its report, and that in
any case his accession cannot be carried back much beyond that, because
it is quite probable (from the congratulations which Alexander extends
to the church of Antioch) that there had been a vacancy in that church
for some time after the death of Serapion (a thing not at all unnatural
in the midst of the persecutions of the time), while Serapion was still
alive as late as 203 (see Bk. V. chap. 19, note 1). But it seems to me
that there is no good ground for making any alteration in the date given
by the *Chron.,* for we know that at the very end of Severus’ reign the
persecution broke out again with considerable severity, and that it
continued, at least in Africa, for some time after Caracalla’s accession
(see Tertullian’s *ad Scap.*). The general amnesty issued by Caracalla
after the murder of his brother Geta in 212 (see Dion Cassius, LXXVII.
3) seems first to have put a definitive end to the persecutions. There
is therefore no ground for confining Alexander’s imprisonment to the
reign of Severus. It may well have run into the time of Caracalla, and
hence it is quite possible that Asclepiades did not become bishop until
after the latter became emperor, so that it is not necessary to correct
the date of the *Chron.* It is impossible to determine with certainty
the length of Asclepiades’ episcopate (see chap. 21, note 6). Of
Asclepiades himself we know no more than is told us in this chapter. He
seems to have been a man of most excellent character, to judge from
Alexander’s epistle. That epistle, of course, was written immediately
after Asclepiades’ appointment.
