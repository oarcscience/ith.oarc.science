made its home among them, <span id="fr_386"></span>[387](#fn_386.md) the
power of <span id="page_116">p. 116</span> <span
id="iii.vii.xvi-Page_116"></span>Simon was quenched and immediately
destroyed, together with the man himself. <span
id="fr_387"></span>[388](#fn_387.md) And so greatly did the splendor of
piety illumine the minds of Peter’s hearers that they were not satisfied
with hearing once only, and were not content with the unwritten teaching
of the divine Gospel, but with all sorts of entreaties they besought
Mark, <span id="fr_388"></span>[389](#fn_388.md) a follower of Peter, and
the one whose Gospel is extant, that he would leave them a written
monument of the doctrine which had been orally communicated to them. Nor
did they cease until they had prevailed with the man, and had thus
become the occasion of the written Gospel which bears the name of
Mark. <span id="fr_389"></span>[390](#fn_389.md)

<span id="iii.vii.xvi-p8"></span>2. And they say that Peter when he had
learned, through a revelation of the Spirit, of that which had been
done, was pleased with the zeal of the men, and that the work obtained
the sanction of his authority for the purpose of being used in the
churches. <span id="fr_390"></span>[391](#fn_390.md) Clement in the eighth
book of his Hypotyposes gives this account, and with him agrees the
bishop of Hierapolis named Papias. <span
id="fr_391"></span>[392](#fn_391.md) And Peter makes mention of Mark in his
first epistle which they say that he wrote in Rome itself, as is
indicated by him, when he calls the city, by a figure, Babylon, as he
does in the following words: “The church that is at Babylon, elected
together with you, saluteth you; and so doth Marcus my son.” <span

<span id="iii.vii.xvi-p3"></span> The origin of the Church at Rome is
shrouded in mystery. Eusebius gives the tradition which rules in the
Catholic Church, viz.: that Christianity was introduced into Rome by
Peter, who went there during the reign of Claudius. But this tradition
is sufficiently disproved by history. The origin of the Church was due
to unknown persons, though it is possible we may obtain a hint of them
in the Andronicus and Junta of [Romans xvi.
7](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#007.md)<span id="iii.vii.xvi-p3.1"></span>,
who are mentioned as apostles, and who were therefore, according to the
usage of the word in Paul’s writings, persons that introduced
Christianity into a new place—missionaries proper, who did not work on
others’ ground.

<span id="iii.vii.xvi-p5"></span> John Mark, son of Mary ([Acts xii.
12](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#012.md)<span
id="iii.vii.xvi-p5.1"></span>), a sister of Barnabas ([Col. iv.
10](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#010.md)<span
id="iii.vii.xvi-p5.2"></span>), was a companion of Paul and Barnabas in
their missionary journeys, and afterward a companion of Barnabas alone
(<span id="iii.vii.xvi-p5.3"></span>[Acts xv.
39](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#039.md)<span
id="iii.vii.xvi-p5.4"></span>), and still later was with Paul again in
Rome ([Col. 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#010.md), [Phlm.
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#024.md)<span
id="iii.vii.xvi-p5.5"></span>[Col. iv.

and [Philemon 24](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#024.md)<span
id="iii.vii.xvi-p5.7"></span>), and with Peter when he wrote his first
epistle ([1 Pet. v. 13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#013.md)<span
id="iii.vii.xvi-p5.8"></span>). For the later traditions concerning
Mark, see the next chapter, note 1.

id="iii.vii.xvi-p5.9"></span>

<span id="iii.vii.xvi-p6"></span> That Mark wrote the second Gospel
under the influence of Peter, or as a record of what he had heard from
him, is the universal tradition of antiquity. Papias, in the famous and
much-disputed passage (quoted by Eusebius, III. 39, below), is the first
to record the tradition. Justin Martyr refers to Mark’s Gospel under the
name “Memoirs (<span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vii.xvi-p6.1"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vii.xvi-p6.2"></span>πομνημονεύματα</span>) of Peter” (*Dial. c.
Tryph.* 106; the translation in the *Ante-Nicene Fathers,* Am. Ed. Vol.
I. p. 252, which refers the <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vii.xvi-p6.3"></span>αὐτοῦ</span> to Christ, is incorrect;
compare Weiss, *N. T. Einleitung,* p. 44, note 4). Irenæus (*Adv. Hær.*
III. 11. 1, quoted below, V. 8. 2), Tertullian (*Adv. Marcionem,* IV.
5), and Origen (quoted below, VI. 25) confirm the tradition, which is
repeated over and over again by the Fathers.

<span id="iii.vii.xvi-p7"></span>The question as to the real authorship
of our second Gospel, or rather as to its composition and its relation
to Matthew and Luke, is a very difficult one. The relationship of the
three synoptical Gospels was first discussed by Augustine (*De Consensu
Evangelistarum*), who defended the traditional order, but made Mark
dependent upon Matthew. This view prevailed until the beginning of the
present century, when the problem was attacked anew, and since then it
has been the crux of the literary criticism of the Bible. The three have
been held to be dependent upon each other, and every possible order has
found its advocates; a common source has been assumed for the three: the
Hebrew Matthew, the *Gospel according to the Hebrews* (see Bk. III.
chap. 25, note 24), our canonical Gospel of Mark, or an original Mark,
resembling the present one; a number of fragmentary documents have been
assumed; while others, finally, have admitted only oral tradition as the
basis. According to Baur’s tendency theory, Matthew (polemically
Jewish-Christian) came first, followed by an original Luke (polemically
Pauline-Christian), then by our Mark, which was based upon both and
written in the interest of neutrality, and lastly by our present Luke,
designed as a final irenicum. This view now finds few advocates. The
whole matter is still unsettled, but criticism seems to be gradually
converging toward a common ground type (or rather two independent types)
for all three while at the same time maintaining the relative
independence of the three, one toward the other. What these ground types
were, is a matter of still sharper dispute, although criticism is
gradually drawing their larger features with more and more certainty and
clearness. (The latest discussion upon the subject by Handmann, *das
Hebräer-Evangelium,* makes the two types the “Ur-Marcus” and the Gospel
of the Hebrews.) That in the last analysis, however, some space must
still be left for floating tradition, or for documents irreducible to
the one or two types, seems absolutely certain. For further information
as to the state of discussion upon this intricate problem, see among
recent works, especially Weiss, *Einleitung,* p. 473 sqq., Holtzmann,
*Einleitung,* p. 328 sqq., and Schaff, *Ch. Hist*. I. 575 sqq., where
the literature down to 1882 is given with great fullness. Conservative
opinion puts the composition of all the synoptic Gospels before the
destruction of Jerusalem (for the date of Luke, see III. 4, note 12);
but the critical school, while throwing the original type back of that
date, considers the composition of our present Gospels to have been the
gradual work of years, assuming that they were not finally crystallized
into the form in which we have them before the second century.

id="iii.vii.xvi-p8.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vii.xvi-p9"></span> This mention of the “pleasure” of
Peter, and the “authority” given by him to the work of Mark, contradicts
the account of Clement to which Eusebius here appeals as his authority.
In Bk. VI. chap. 14 he quotes from the *Hypotyposes* of Clement, a
passage which must be identical with the one referred to in this place,
for it is from the same work and the general account is the same; but
there Clement says expressly, “which when Peter understood he neither
directly hindered nor encouraged it.”

<span id="fn_391"></span>[116:392](2010057.htm#fr_391.md) <span
id="iii.vii.xvi-p9.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vii.xvi-p10"></span> The passage from Papias is quoted
below in Bk. III. chap. 39. Papias is a witness to the general fact that
Mark wrote down what he had heard from Peter, but not (so far as he is
extant) to the details of the account as given by Eusebius. Upon Papias
himself, see Bk. III. chap. 39.

<span id="fn_392"></span>[116:393](2010057.htm#fr_392.md) <span
id="iii.vii.xvi-p10.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vii.xvi-p11"></span> [1 Pet. v.
13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#013.md)<span
id="iii.vii.xvi-p11.1"></span>. Commentators are divided as to the place
in which Peter wrote this epistle (compare *Schaff’s Church Hist.* I. p.
744 sqq.). The interpretation given by Eusebius is the patristic and
Roman Catholic opinion, and is maintained by many Protestant
commentators. But on the other hand the literal use of the word
“Babylon” is defended by a great number of the leading scholars of the
present day. Compare Weiss, *N. T. Einleitung,* p. 433, note 1.
