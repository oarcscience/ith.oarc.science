<span id="iii.xiv.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xiv.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII.</span>

<span id="iii.xiv.viii-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xiv.viii-p2.1"></span>Again</span>, in Cæsarea, when the
persecution had continued to the fifth year, on the second day of the
month Xanthicus, <span id="fr_2655"></span>[2656](#fn_2655.md) which is the
fourth before the Nones of April, on the very Lord’s day of our
Saviour’s resurrection, <span id="fr_2656"></span>[2657](#fn_2656.md)
Theodosia, a virgin from Tyre, a faithful and sedate maiden, not yet
eighteen years of age, went up to certain prisoners who were confessing
the kingdom of Christ and sitting before the judgment seat, and saluted
them, and, as is probable, besought them to remember her when they came
before the Lord.

<span id="iii.xiv.viii-p5"></span>2. Thereupon, as if she had committed
a profane and impious act, the soldiers seized her and led her to the
governor. And he immediately, like a madman and a wild beast in his
anger, tortured her with dreadful and most terrible torments in her
sides and breasts, even to the very bones. And as she still breathed,
and withal stood with a joyful and beaming countenance, he ordered her
thrown into the waves of the sea. Then passing from her to the other
confessors, he condemned all of them to the copper mines in Phæno in
Palestine.

<span id="iii.xiv.viii-p6"></span>3. Afterwards on the fifth of the
month Dius, <span id="fr_2657"></span>[2658](#fn_2657.md) on the Nones of
November according to the Romans, in the same city, Silvanus <span
id="fr_2658"></span>[2659](#fn_2658.md) (who at that time was a presbyter
and confessor, but who shortly after was honored with the episcopate and
died a martyr), and those with him, men who had shown the noblest
firmness in behalf of religion, were condemned by him to labor in the
same copper mines, command being first given that their ankles be
disabled with hot irons.

<span id="iii.xiv.viii-p9"></span>4. At the same time he delivered to
the flames a man who was illustrious through numerous other confessions.
This was Domninus, who was well known to all in Palestine for his
exceeding fearlessness. <span id="fr_2659"></span>[2660](#fn_2659.md) After
this the same judge, who was a cruel contriver of suffering, and an
inventor of devices against the doctrine of Christ, planned against the
pious punishments that had never been heard of. He condemned three to
single pugilistic combat. He delivered to be devoured by wild beasts
Auxentius, a grave and holy old man. Others who were in mature life he
made eunuchs, and condemned them to the same mines. Yet others, after
severe tortures, he cast into prison.

<span id="iii.xiv.viii-p11"></span>Among these was my dearest friend
Pamphilus, <span id="fr_2660"></span>[2661](#fn_2660.md) who was by reason
of every virtue the most illustrious of the martyrs in our time.

<span id="iii.xiv.viii-p13"></span>5. Urbanus first tested him in
rhetorical philosophy and learning; and afterwards endeavored to compel
him to sacrifice. But as he saw that he refused and in nowise regarded
his threats, being exceedingly angry, he ordered him to be tormented
with severest tortures.

<span id="iii.xiv.viii-p14"></span>6. And when the brutal man, after he
had almost satiated himself with these tortures by continuous and
prolonged scrapings in his sides, was yet covered with shame before all,
he put him also with the confessors in prison.

<span id="iii.xiv.viii-p15"></span>7. But what recompense for his
cruelty to the saints, he who thus abused the martyrs of Christ, shall
receive from the Divine judgment, may be easily determined from the
preludes to it, in which immediately, and not long after his daring
cruelties against Pamphilus, while he yet held the government, the
Divine judgment came upon him. For thus suddenly, he who but yesterday
was judging on the lofty tribunal, guarded by a band of soldiers, and
ruling over the whole nation of Palestine, the associate and dearest
friend and table companion of the tyrant himself, was stripped in one
night, and overwhelmed with disgrace and shame before those who had
formerly admired him as if he were himself an emperor; and he appeared
cowardly and unmanly, uttering womanish cries and supplications to all
the people whom he had ruled. And Maximinus himself, in reliance upon
whose favor Urbanus was formerly so arrogantly insolent, as if he loved
him exceedingly for his deeds against us, was set as a harsh and most
severe judge in this same Cæsarea to pronounce sentence of death against
him, for the great disgrace of the crimes of which he was convicted. Let
us say this in passing.

<span id="iii.xiv.viii-p16"></span>8. A suitable time may come when we
shall have leisure to relate the end and the fate of those impious <span
id="page_349">p. 349</span> <span id="iii.xiv.viii-Page_349"></span>men
who especially fought against us, <span
id="fr_2661"></span>[2662](#fn_2661.md) both of Maximinus himself and those
with him.

<span id="iii.xiv.viii-p3"></span> i.e. April 2, 307. Eusebius is
inconsistent with himself in this case. In chap. 3, above, he states
that Apphianus suffered on April 2, in the third year of the
persecution. But as shown in the note on that passage, Apphianus
suffered in April, 306, and therefore, in that case, Eusebius reckons
the first year of the persecution as beginning after the second of
April. But in the present case he reckons it as beginning before the
second of April, and the latter date as falling early in a new year of
the persecution. That the martyrdom recorded in the present case
actually took place in 307, and not in 308, as it must have done if
Eusebius were consistent with himself, is proved, first, by the fact
that, in entering upon this new chapter, he says, “the persecution
having continued to the fifth year,” implying thereby that the event
which he is about to relate took place at the beginning, not at the end,
of the fifth year; and secondly, by the fact that later on, in this same
chapter, while still relating the events of the fifth year, he recounts
martyrdoms as taking place in the month of November (Dius). This is
conclusive, for November of the fifth year can be only November, 307,
and hence the April mentioned in the present paragraph can be only April
of the same year. Evidently Eusebius did not reckon the beginning of the
persecution in Palestine from a fixed day, but rather from the month
Xanthicus (April). As a consequence, the inconsistency into which he has
fallen is not very strange; the second day of April might easily be
reckoned either as one of the closing days of a year, or as the
beginning of the ensuing year. In the present case, he evidently forgot
that he had previously used the former reckoning.

<span id="iii.xiv.viii-p17"></span> The death of Maximinus is related in
Bk. IX. chap. 10. Nothing further is said in regard to Urbanus; but the
fate of his successor Firmilianus is recorded in chap. 11, below. It is
quite possible that Eusebius, in the present case, is referring to a
more detailed statement of the fates of the various persecutors, which
was to form the second part of the present work; and it is possible,
still further, that the appendix printed at the close of the eighth book
is a fragment of this second part, as suggested by Lightfoot (see above,
p. 29).
