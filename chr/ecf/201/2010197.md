<span id="iii.xi.xxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xi.xxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVII</span>.—*How the Bishops
regarded Origen.*

<span id="iii.xi.xxvii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xi.xxvii-p2.1"></span>He</span> was so earnestly affected toward
Origen, that he urged him to come to that country for the benefit of the
churches, and moreover he visited him in Judea, remaining with him for
some time, for the sake of improvement in divine things. And
Alexander, <span id="fr_1998"></span>[1999](#fn_1998) bishop of
Jerusalem, and Theoctistus, <span id="fr_1999"></span>[2000](#fn_1999)
bishop of Cæsarea, attended on him constantly, <span
id="fr_2000"></span>[2001](#fn_2000) as their only teacher, and
allowed <span id="fr_2001"></span>[2002](#fn_2001) him to expound the
Divine Scriptures, and to perform the other duties pertaining to
ecclesiastical discourse. <span id="fr_2002"></span>[2003](#fn_2002)

to preach and teach only from the bishop, and hence these bishops
extended to Origen, whom they had ordained a presbyter, full liberty to
preach and teach within their dioceses.
