id="iv.vi.iii.lvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter LVI</span>.—*Destruction of the
Temple of Æsculapius at Ægæ.* <span id="fr_3289"></span>[3290](#fn_3289.md)

<span id="iv.vi.iii.lvi-p3"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.lvi-p3.1"></span>For</span> since a wide-spread error of
these pretenders to wisdom concerned the demon worshiped in Cilicia,
whom thousands regarded with reverence as the possessor of saving and
healing power, who sometimes appeared to those who passed the night in
his temple, sometimes restored the diseased to health, though on the
contrary he was a destroyer of souls, who drew his easily deluded
worshipers from the true Saviour to involve them in impious error, the
emperor, consistently with his practice, and desire to advance the
worship of him who is at once a jealous God and the true Saviour, gave
directions that this temple also should be razed to the ground. In
prompt obedience to this command, a band of soldiers laid this building,
the admiration of noble philosophers, prostrate in the dust, together
with its unseen inmate, neither demon nor god, but rather a deceiver of
souls, who had seduced mankind for so long a time through various ages.
And thus he who had promised to others deliverance from misfortune and
distress, could find no means for his own security, any more than when,
as is told in myth, he was scorched by the lightning’s stroke. <span
id="fr_3290"></span>[3291](#fn_3290.md) Our emperor’s pious deeds, however,
had in them nothing fabulous or feigned; but by virtue of the manifested
power of his Saviour, this temple as well as others was so utterly
overthrown, that not a vestige of the former follies was left behind.
