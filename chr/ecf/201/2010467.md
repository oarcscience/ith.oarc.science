Favor of the People.*

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xxii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.xxii-p2.1"></span>But</span> his munificence bestowed still
further and more numerous favors on the heathen peoples and the other
nations of his empire. So that the inhabitants of our \[Eastern\]
regions, who had heard of the privileges experienced in the opposite
portion of the empire, and had blessed the fortunate recipients of them,
and longed for the enjoyment of a similar lot for themselves, now with
one consent proclaimed their own happiness, when they saw themselves in
possession of all these blessings; and confessed that the appearance of
such a monarch to the human race was indeed a marvelous event, and such
as the world’s history had never yet recorded. Such were their
sentiments.
