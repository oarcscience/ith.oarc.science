from Nicomedia to the Palace at Constantinople.*

<span id="iv.vi.iv.lxvi-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.lxvi-p2.1"></span>After</span> this the soldiers lifted the
body from its couch, and laid it in a golden coffin, which they
enveloped in a covering of purple, and removed to the city which was
called by his own name. Here it was placed in an elevated position in
the principal chamber of the imperial palace, and surrounded by candles
burning in candlesticks of gold, presenting a marvelous spectacle, and
such as no one under the light of the sun had ever seen on earth since
the world itself began. For in the central apartment of the imperial
palace, the body of the emperor lay in its elevated resting-place,
arrayed in the symbols of sovereignty, the diadem and purple robe, and
encircled by a numerous retinue of attendants, who watched around it
incessantly night and day.
