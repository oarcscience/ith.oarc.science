<span id="iv.vi.i.lvii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.lvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter LVII</span>.—*That
Maximian,* <span id="fr_3154"></span>[3155](#fn_3154.md) *brought Low by a
Fistulous Ulcer with Worms, issued an Edict in Favor of the Christians.*

<span id="iv.vi.i.lvii-p3"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.lvii-p3.1"></span>For</span> whereas this man had commenced
the attack on the churches, and had been the first to pollute his soul
with the blood of just and godly men, a judgment from God overtook him,
which at first affected his body, but eventually extended itself to his
soul. For suddenly an abscess appeared in the secret parts of his
person, followed by a deeply seated fistulous ulcer; and these diseases
fastened with incurable virulence on the intestines, which swarmed with
a vast multitude of worms, and emitted a pestilential odor. Besides, his
entire person had become loaded, through gluttonous excess, with an
enormous quantity of fat, and this, being now in a putrescent state, is
said to have presented to all who approached him an intolerable and
dreadful spectacle. Having, therefore, to struggle against such
sufferings, at length, though late, he came to a realization of his past
crimes against the Church; and, confessing his sins before God, he put a
stop to the persecution of the Christians, and hastened to issue
imperial edicts and rescripts for the rebuilding of their churches, at
the same time enjoining them to perform their customary worship, and to
offer up prayers on his behalf. <span
