<span id="iii.vii.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.vii.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIII.—</span>*Simon Magus.* <span
id="fr_359"></span>[360](#fn_359.md)

<span id="iii.vii.xiv-p3"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.vii.xiv-p3.1"></span>But</span> faith in our Saviour and Lord
Jesus Christ having now been diffused among all men, <span
id="fr_360"></span>[361](#fn_360.md) the enemy of man’s salvation contrived
a plan for seizing the imperial city for himself. He conducted thither
the above-mentioned Simon, <span id="fr_361"></span>[362](#fn_361.md) aided
him in his deceitful arts, led many of the inhabitants of Rome astray,
and thus brought them into his own power.

<span id="iii.vii.xiv-p6"></span>2. This is stated by Justin, <span
id="fr_362"></span>[363](#fn_362.md) one of our distinguished writers who
lived not long after the time of the apostles. Concerning him I shall
speak in the proper place. <span id="fr_363"></span>[364](#fn_363.md) Take
and read the work of this <span id="page_114">p. 114</span> <span
id="iii.vii.xiv-Page_114"></span>man, who in the first Apology <span
id="fr_364"></span>[365](#fn_364.md) which he addressed to Antonine in
behalf of our religion writes as follows: <span
id="fr_365"></span>[366](#fn_365.md)

<span id="iii.vii.xiv-p11"></span>3. “And after the ascension of the
Lord into heaven the demons put forward certain men who said they were
gods, and who were not only allowed by you to go unpersecuted, but were
even deemed worthy of honors. One of them was Simon, a Samaritan of the
village of Gitto, <span id="fr_366"></span>[367](#fn_366.md) who in the
reign of Claudius Cæsar <span id="fr_367"></span>[368](#fn_367.md)
performed in your imperial city some mighty acts of magic by the art of
demons operating in him, and was considered a god, and as a god was
honored by you with a statue, which was erected in the river
Tiber, <span id="fr_368"></span>[369](#fn_368.md) between the two bridges,
and bore this inscription in the Latin tongue, *Simoni Deo Sancto*, that
is, *To Simon the Holy God.* <span id="fr_369"></span>[370](#fn_369.md)

<span id="iii.vii.xiv-p16"></span>4. And nearly all the Samaritans and a
few even of other nations confess and worship him as the first God. And
there went around with him at that time a certain Helena <span
id="fr_370"></span>[371](#fn_370.md) who had formerly been a prostitute in
Tyre of Phœnicia; and her they call the first idea that proceeded from
him.” <span id="fr_371"></span>[372](#fn_371.md)

<span id="iii.vii.xiv-p19"></span>5. Justin relates these things, and
Irenæus also agrees with him in the first book of his work, Against
Heresies, where he gives an account of the man <span
id="fr_372"></span>[373](#fn_372.md) and of his profane and impure
teaching. It would be superfluous to quote his account here, for it is
possible for those who wish to know the origin and the lives and the
false doctrines of each of the heresiarchs that have followed him, as
well as the customs practiced by them all, to find them treated at
length in the above-mentioned work of Irenæus.

<span id="iii.vii.xiv-p21"></span>6. We have understood that Simon was
the author of all heresy. <span id="fr_373"></span>[374](#fn_373.md) From
his time down to the present those who have followed his heresy have
feigned the sober philosophy of the Christians, which is celebrated
among all on account of its purity of life. But they nevertheless have
embraced again the superstitions of idols, which they seemed to have
renounced; and they fall down before pictures and images of Simon
himself and of the above-mentioned Helena who was with him; and they
venture to worship them with incense and sacrifices and libations.

<span id="iii.vii.xiv-p23"></span>7. But those matters which they keep
more secret than these, in regard to which they say that one upon first
hearing them would be astonished, and, to use one of the written phrases
in vogue among them, would be confounded, <span
id="fr_374"></span>[375](#fn_374.md) are in truth full of amazing things,
and of madness and folly, being of such a sort that it is impossible not
only to commit them to writing, but also for modest men even to utter
them with the lips on account of their excessive baseness and
lewdness. <span id="fr_375"></span>[376](#fn_375.md)

<span id="iii.vii.xiv-p26"></span>8. For whatever could be conceived of,
viler than the vilest thing—all that has been outdone by this most
abominable sect, which is composed of those who make a sport of those
miserable females that are literally overwhelmed with all kinds of
vices. <span id="fr_376"></span>[377](#fn_376.md)

<span id="iii.vii.xiv-p2"></span> It is justly remarked by Reuterdahl
that no chapters of Eusebius’ *History* are so imperfect and
unsatisfactory as those which relate to heresies, but that this is to be
ascribed more to the age than to the author. A right understanding of
heresies and an appreciation of any truth which they might contain was
utterly impossible to men who looked upon heresy as the work of the
devil, and all heretics as his chosen tools. Eusebius has been condemned
by some, because he gives his information about heretics only from
second hand, and quotes none of them directly; but it must be remembered
that this method was by no means peculiar to Eusebius, and, moreover, it
is highly probable that he did not have access to any of their works.
The accounts of the heretics given by Irenæus, Hippolytus, and others
would of course be preserved, but the writings of heretics themselves
would be piously excluded as completely as possible from all Christian
libraries, and the knowledge of them cannot have remained long in the
Church. The sources upon which we have to rely at the present day for a
knowledge of these heresies furnish an illustration of this. We know
them almost solely through their enemies, and Eusebius knew them in the
same way and very likely for the same reason.

<span id="fn_361"></span>[113:362](2010055.htm#fr_361.md) <span
id="iii.vii.xiv-p4.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vii.xiv-p5"></span> Simon Magus, of whom mention is first
made in [Acts viii. 9](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#009.md)<span
id="iii.vii.xiv-p5.1"></span> sqq. (quoted above, in chap. 1), played a
very prominent role in early Church history. His life has been so
greatly embellished with legends that it is very difficult to extract a
trustworthy account of him. Indeed the Tübingen school, as well as some
other modern critics, have denied altogether the existence of such a
personage, and have resolved the account of him into a Jewish Christian
fiction produced in hostility to the apostle Paul, who under the mask of
Simon was attacked as the real heretic. But this identification of Paul
and Simon rests upon a very slender foundation, as many passages can be
adduced in which the two are expressly distinguished, and indeed the
thought of identifying Paul and Simon seems never to have occurred to
the writer of the *Recognitions.* The most that can be said is that the
author of the *Homilies* gives, and without doubt purposely, some
Pauline traits to his picture of Simon, but this does not imply that he
makes Simon no more than a mask for Paul (cf. the words of Salmon in his
article, *Clementine Literature,* in the *Dict. of Christ. Biog.* Vol.
I. p. 576). The original of Simon then is not to be found in Paul. The
third century fiction is based upon a real historic person whose actual
existence must be assumed to account for the early notices of him in the
Acts and in Justin Martyr, as well as the common tradition of him among
all parties in the Church. Salmon considers Simon of Gitton—the basis of
the account of Justin Martyr and of all the later Simon legends—a second
century Gnostic distinct from the Simon mentioned in the Acts (see his
excellent article *Simon Magus,* in the *Dict. of Christ. Biog.* IV. p.
681 sqq.). In the Pseudo-Clementines Simon is represented as traveling
widely and spreading his errors in all directions, while Peter follows
him for the purpose of exposing his impostures, and refutes him
repeatedly in public disputations, until at length he conquers him
completely in Rome, and Simon ends his life by suicide. His death, as
well as his life, is recorded in various conflicting and fabulous
traditions (see note 9, below). For ancient accounts of Simon, see
Justin Martyr, *Apol.* I. 26 and 56 and *Dial. c. Trypho.* CXX.; the
Pseudo-Clementine *Homilies* and *Recognitions;* Irenæus, I. 23;
Hippolytus, VI. 2 sq.; Tertullian’s *Apology, On Idolatry, On the Soul,*
etc.; *Apost. Constitutions,* VII. 7 sq.; Arnobius, *Adv. Gentes,* II.
12, &c.; *Acts of the Holy Apostles Peter and Paul (Ante-Nicene
Fathers,* Am. ed. VIII. p. 477 sqq.); Epiphanius, *Hær.* XXI.; and

<span id="iii.vii.xiv-p12"></span> Gitton was a village of Samaria, near
Flavia Neapolis (the modern Nâblus), and is identified by Robinson with
the present village of Kuryet Jît (see Robinson’s *Biblical Researches,*
III. p. 144, note). Some have doubted the accuracy of Justin’s report,
for the reason that Josephus (*Ant.* XXII. 7. 2) mentions a magician
named Simon, of about the same date, who was born in Cyprus. There was a
town called <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vii.xiv-p12.1"></span>Κίτιον</span> in Cyprus, and it has been
thought that Justin may have mistaken this place for the Samaritan
Gitton. But even if we assume the identity of the two Simons as many
critics do, it is less likely that Justin, a native of Samaria, was
mistaken upon a question concerning his own country, than that Josephus
was. Simon’s activity may have extended to Cyprus, in which case
Josephus might easily have mistaken his birthplace.

<span id="fn_367"></span>[114:368](2010055.htm#fr_367.md) <span
id="iii.vii.xiv-p12.2"></span>

<span id="iii.vii.xiv-p13"></span> Justin here assigns Simon’s visit to
Rome to the reign of Claudius (41–54 <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.vii.xiv-p13.1"></span>a.d.</span>), as Irenæus also does. Other
accounts assign it to the reign of Nero, but all differ as to the
details of his death; suicide, death from injuries received while trying
to fly, voluntary burial in expectation of rising again on the third
day, &c., are reported in different traditions. All, however, agree that
he visited Rome at some time or another.

<span id="fn_368"></span>[114:369](2010055.htm#fr_368.md) <span
id="iii.vii.xiv-p13.2"></span>

<span id="iii.vii.xiv-p14"></span> That is, on the island which lies in
the middle of the Tiber, a short distance below the Vatican, and which
now bears the name *Isola Tiberiana,* or *di S. Sebastiano.*

<span id="fn_369"></span>[114:370](2010055.htm#fr_369.md) <span
id="iii.vii.xiv-p14.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vii.xiv-p15"></span> In 1574 a statue, bearing the
inscription *Semoni Sanco deo fidio,* &c., was found in the place
described by Justin Martyr, but this statue was erected to the Sabine
divinity Semo Sancus. It is therefore highly probable that Justin
mistook this statue for a statue of Simon Magus. This is now the
commonly accepted view, though the translator of Justin Martyr in the
*Ante-Nicene Fathers* ventures to dispute it (see the Am. ed. Vol. I. p.
171, note). The report is given a second time by Justin in his *Apol.*
56, and also by Irenæus, I. 23. 1 (who, however, simply says “It is
said,” and may have drawn his knowledge only from Justin Martyr) and by
Tertullian, *Apol.* chap. 13. The last named is in general a poor
authority even if he be independent of Justin at this point, which is
not probable. Hippolytus, who lived at Rome, and who gives us an account
of the death of Simon (Bk. VII. chap. 15), says nothing about the statue
and his silence is a strong argument against it.

<span id="fn_370"></span>[114:371](2010055.htm#fr_370.md) <span
id="iii.vii.xiv-p16.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vii.xiv-p17"></span> A similar story is told of this Helen
by Irenæus, I. 23; by Hippolytus, VI. 15 (who adds some important
particulars); by Tertullian, *De Anima,* 34; by Epiphanius, *Hær.* 21;
and by Theodoret, *Hær. Fab.* I. 1; compare also Origen, *Contra
Celsum,* V. 62. Simon taught that this Helen was the first conception of
his mind, the mother of all things, the impersonation of the divine
intelligence, &c. The Simonians, according to Irenæus (I. 23. 4), and
Hippolytus (VI. 15; see chap. 14, note 8), had images of Simon and Helen
whom they honored as Jupiter and Minerva. Simon’s doctrines and
practice, as recorded by these Fathers, show some of the general
conceptions common to all the Gnostic systems, but exhibit a crude and
undeveloped form of Gnosticism. Upon Helen, see Salmon, in the *Dict. of
Christ. Biog.* II. p. 880 sq., and all the works upon Simon Magus.

<span id="fn_371"></span>[114:372](2010055.htm#fr_371.md) <span
id="iii.vii.xiv-p17.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vii.xiv-p18"></span> This conception of the idea (<span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.vii.xiv-p18.1"></span>ž</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.vii.xiv-p18.2"></span>ννοια</span>) is
thoroughly Gnostic, and plays an important part in all the Gnostic
systems. Most of these systems had a dualistic element recognizing the
<span class="Greek"><span id="iii.vii.xiv-p18.3"></span>δύναμις</span>
and the <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vii.xiv-p18.4"></span>ž</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vii.xiv-p18.5"></span>ννοια</span>as the original principles
from whose union all beings emanated. These general conceptions appeared
in all varieties of forms in the different systems.

<span id="fn_372"></span>[114:373](2010055.htm#fr_372.md) <span
id="iii.vii.xiv-p19.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vii.xiv-p20"></span> Irenæus *adv. Hær.* I. 23.

<span id="fn_375"></span>[114:376](2010055.htm#fr_375.md) <span
id="iii.vii.xiv-p24.2"></span>

<span id="iii.vii.xiv-p25"></span> This was the general opinion of the
early Fathers, all of whom picture Gnosticism as a wilderness of
absurdities and nonsense; and Irenæus, Hippolytus, and others undertake
its refutation only for the purpose of exposing these absurdities. It is
treated by none of them as an intelligent speculation with a foundation
in reason or sense. This thorough misunderstanding of the nature and aim
of Gnosticism has been perpetuated in our day by many writers upon the
subject. Neander was the first to attempt a thoroughly philosophical
treatment of it (in his *Genetische Entwickelung d. gnost. Systeme,*
Berlin, 1818), and since that time the subject has been treated
intelligently and discriminatingly by many writers, e.g. Baur, Lipsius,
Lightfoot, Salmon and especially Harnack who has grasped the true
principle of Gnosticism perhaps more fully than any one else. See his
*Dogmengeschichte,* I. p. 158 sqq.

<span id="fn_376"></span>[114:377](2010055.htm#fr_376.md) <span
id="iii.vii.xiv-p26.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vii.xiv-p27"></span> This was true of the Simonians, who
were very immoral and licentious, and of some other Gnostic sects, as
e.g. the Ophites, the Carpocratians, &c. But many of the Gnostics, e.g.
Marcion (but see below, IV. 11, note 24), Saturninus, Tatian, &c., went
to the opposite extreme, teaching a rigid and gloomy asceticism.
Underlying both of these extremes we perceive the same principle—a
dualism of matter and spirit, therefore of body and mind—the former
considered as the work of the devil, and therefore to be despised and
abused: the latter as divine, and therefore to be honored above all
else. The abhorrence of the body, and of matter and nature in general,
logically led to one of the two opposite results, asceticism or
antinomianism, according to the character and instincts of the person
himself. See Schaff, *Church Hist.* II. p. 457 sqq. The Fathers, in
their hatred of all forms of heresy, naturally saw no good in any of
them, and heretics were therefore indiscriminately accused of immorality
and licentiousness in their worst forms.
