id="iii.x.xxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVII.—</span>*The Works of Others
that flourished at that Time.*

<span id="iii.x.xxviii-p2"></span><span class="c13"><span
id="iii.x.xxviii-p2.1"></span>Numerous</span> memorials of the faithful
zeal of the ancient ecclesiastical men of that time are still preserved
by many. Of these we would note particularly the writings of
Heraclitus <span id="fr_1726"></span>[1727](#fn_1726.md) On the Apostle,
and those of Maximus on the question so much discussed among heretics,
the Origin of Evil, and on the Creation of Matter. <span
id="fr_1727"></span>[1728](#fn_1727.md) Also those of Candidus on the
Hexæmeron, <span id="fr_1728"></span>[1729](#fn_1728.md) and of Apion <span
id="fr_1729"></span>[1730](#fn_1729.md) on the same subject; likewise of
Sextus <span id="fr_1730"></span>[1731](#fn_1730.md) on the Resurrection,
and another treatise of Arabianus, <span
id="fr_1731"></span>[1732](#fn_1731.md) and writings of a multitude of
others, in regard to whom, because we have no data, it is impossible to
state in our work when they lived, or to give any account of their
history. <span id="fr_1732"></span>[1733](#fn_1732.md) And works of many
others have come <span id="page_246">p. 246</span> <span
id="iii.x.xxviii-Page_246"></span>down to us whose names we are unable
to give, orthodox and ecclesiastical, as their interpretations of the
Divine Scriptures show, but unknown to us, because their names are not
stated in their writings. <span id="fr_1733"></span>[1734](#fn_1733.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1726"></span>[245:1727](2010168.htm#fr_1726.md) <span
id="iii.x.xxviii-p2.2"></span>

<span id="iii.x.xxviii-p3"></span> This Heraclitus is mentioned only by
Eusebius and by Jerome (*de vir. ill.* chap. 46), who, in his
description of him and in the five following chapters (on Maximus,
Candidus, Apion, Sextus, and Arabianus), does nothing more than repeat
the words of Eusebius in this chapter. The work which Eusebius calls τὰ
῾Ηρακλείτου εἰς τὸν ἀπόστολον is called by Jerome *in apostolum
Commentarios*. The word ἀπόστολος was quite commonly used among the
Fathers to denote the epistles of Paul (see Suicer’s *Thesaurus*), and
hence Eusebius seems here to refer to commentaries (the plural article
τὰ is used) on the Pauline epistles. These commentaries are no longer
extant, and we know nothing of their nature.

<span id="fn_1727"></span>[245:1728](2010168.htm#fr_1727.md) <span
id="iii.x.xxviii-p3.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.xxviii-p4"></span> The Greek reads <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.x.xxviii-p4.1"></span>καὶ τὰ Μαξιμου περὶ
τοῦ πολυθρυλήτου παρὰ τοῖς αἱρεσιώταις ζητήματος, τοῦ πόθεν ἡ κακία, καὶ
περὶ τοῦ γενητὴν ὑπ€ρχειν τὴν ὕλην</span>. The plural <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.x.xxviii-p4.2"></span>τὰ</span> (*sc.* <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.x.xxviii-p4.3"></span>ὑ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.x.xxviii-p4.4"></span>πομνήματα</span>)
might lead us to suppose Eusebius refers here to separate works, were it
not for the fact that in his *Præp. Evang.* VII. 22 is found a long
extract from a work of Maximus *On Matter* (<span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.x.xxviii-p4.5"></span>περὶ τῆς ὕλης</span>) in which the subject
of the origin of evil is discussed in connection with the origin and
nature of matter. In that age one could hardly discuss the origin of
evil without at the same time discussing matter, to which the origin of
evil was referred by the great majority of the ancients. We are to
suppose, then, that the work of Maximus bore the double title given by
Eusebius in this chapter. Jerome in his *de vir. ill.* chap. 47, says:
*Maximus*…*famosam quæstionem insigni volumine ventilavit, unde malum,
et quod materia a Deo facta sit.* As remarked above, a long extract,
which must have been taken from this work, is given by Eusebius in his
*Præp. Evang.* It appears from this extract that the work was written in
the form of a dialogue between three speakers,—two inquirers, and one
orthodox Christian. The same fragment of Maximus’ work is found also in
the twenty-fourth chapter of the *Philocalia* of Origen, and is said by
the editors, Gregory and Basil, to have been copied by them from
Eusebius’ work. The *Dialogue on Free Will,* ascribed to Methodius (of
the early part of the fourth century), made large use of this work of
Maximus; and the same is to be said of the Pseudo-Origenistic *Dialogue
against the Marcionites,* though according to Routh (*Rel. Sac.* II. p.
79) the latter drew his quotations from Methodius and not directly from
Maximus. The work of Methodius undoubtedly contains much more of
Maximus’ work than is given here by Eusebius; but it is difficult to
ascertain what is his own and what belongs to Maximus, and Routh, in
publishing the fragments of Maximus’ work (*ibid.* p. 87–107), gives
only the extract quoted by Eusebius. In his *Præp. Evang.* Eusebius
speaks of Maximus as <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.x.xxviii-p4.6"></span>τῆς χριστοῦ διατριβὴς οὐκ ἄσημος
ἀνήρ</span>, but we know no more about him than has been already
indicated. Gallandius suggests that he may be identical with Maximus,
the twenty-sixth bishop of Jerusalem (see above, chap. 12), who, it is
quite probable, lived about this time (cf. Eusebius’ *Chron.,* year of
Abr. 2202). But Eusebius, neither in this chapter nor in his *Præp.
Evang.,* calls Maximus a bishop, and it seems proper to conclude that he
at least did not know that he was a bishop; and hence Gallandius’
conjecture, which rests only upon agreement in a very common name, must
be pronounced quite baseless.

<span id="fn_1728"></span>[245:1729](2010168.htm#fr_1728.md) <span
id="iii.x.xxviii-p4.7"></span>

<span id="iii.x.xxviii-p5"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.x.xxviii-p5.1"></span>εἰς τὴν ἑξαήμερον</span> (*sc.* <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.x.xxviii-p5.2"></span>κοσμοποιΐαν</span>
<span class="Greek"><span id="iii.x.xxviii-p5.3"></span>ορ</span> <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.x.xxviii-p5.4"></span>δημιουργίαν</span>).
The adjective <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.x.xxviii-p5.5"></span>ἑ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.x.xxviii-p5.6"></span>ξαήμερος</span> was commonly used in this
way, with the feminine article, implying a noun understood, and
referring to the six days’ work of creation (see Suicer’s *Thesaurus*).
The subject was quite a favorite one with the Fathers. Hippolytus,
Basil, Gregory of Nyssa, Ambrose, and others wrote upon it, as did also
the Apion mentioned in the next sentence. The work of Candidus is no
longer extant, nor do we know anything more about it and its author than
Eusebius tells us here. The plural <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.x.xxviii-p5.7"></span>τὰ</span> occurs again, and Jerome
supplies *tractatus.* Whether the word fitly describes the work, or
works, or whether they were rather of the nature of homilies, like
Basil’s, we do not know. Sophronius, in translating Jerome, puts <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.x.xxviii-p5.8"></span>ὁ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.x.xxviii-p5.9"></span>μιλίας</span> for
*tractatus,* but this of course is of no authority.

<span id="fn_1729"></span>[245:1730](2010168.htm#fr_1729.md) <span
id="iii.x.xxviii-p5.10"></span>

<span id="iii.x.xxviii-p6"></span> Apion’s work is mentioned also by
Jerome (*de vir. ill.* chap. 4), but nothing is added to the statement
of Eusebius. We know nothing more about him or his work.

<span id="fn_1730"></span>[245:1731](2010168.htm#fr_1730.md) <span
id="iii.x.xxviii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.xxviii-p7"></span> Sextus also is mentioned by Jerome,
in his *de vir. ill.* chap. 50, but we know nothing about him or his
work, except what Eusebius tells us here.

<span id="fn_1731"></span>[245:1732](2010168.htm#fr_1731.md) <span
id="iii.x.xxviii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.xxviii-p8"></span> Nothing more is known of this
Arabianus, and Eusebius does not even tell us the name of his work. His
silence is difficult to explain. We can hardly imagine that the title
was intentionally omitted; for had there been a reason for such a
course, there must have been as much reason for omitting the writer’s
name also. It does not seem probable that he had never known the title
of the book, for he was not in the habit of mentioning works which he
had not seen, except with the formula <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.x.xxviii-p8.1"></span>λόγος žχει</span>, or something of the
kind, to indicate that he makes his statement only on the authority of
others. It is possible that he had seen this, with the other works
mentioned (perhaps all bound in one volume), at sometime in the past,
but that the title of Arabianus’ work had escaped him, and hence he
simply mentioned the work along with the others, without considering the
title a matter of great importance. He speaks of but a single
work,—<span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.x.xxviii-p8.2"></span>ἄ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.x.xxviii-p8.3"></span>λλη τις ὑπόθεσις</span>,—but Jerome (chap.
51) mentions *quædam opuscula ad christianum dogma pertinentia.* His
description is not specific enough to lead us to think that he had
personal knowledge of Arabianus’ writings. It must rather be concluded
that he allowed himself some license, and that, not satisfied to speak
of a writer without naming his works, and, at the same time, knowing
nothing definite about them, he simply calls them, in the most general
terms, *ad christianum dogma pertinentia;* for if they were Christian
works, he was pretty safe in concluding that they had to do, in some way
at least, with Christian doctrine. The substitution of the plural for
the singular (*quædam opuscula* for <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.x.xxviii-p8.4"></span>τις ὑπόθεσις</span>) can hardly have been
an accident. It is, perhaps safe to say, knowing Jerome’s methods, that
he permitted himself to make the change in order to conceal his own
ignorance of the writings of Arabianus; for to mention a single book,
and say no more about it than that it had to do with Christian doctrine,
would be a betrayal of entire ignorance in regard to it; but to sum up a
number of writings under the general head *ad christianum dogma
pertinentia,* instead of giving all the titles in detail, would be, of
course, quite consistent with an exact acquaintance with all of them. If
our supposition be correct, we have simply another instance of Jerome’s
common sin, and an instance which, in this case, reveals a sharp
contrast between his character and that of Eusebius, who never hesitated
to confess his ignorance.

<span id="fn_1732"></span>[245:1733](2010168.htm#fr_1732.md) <span
id="iii.x.xxviii-p8.5"></span>

<span id="iii.x.xxviii-p9"></span> Eusebius does not imply, in this
sentence, that he is not acquainted with these works to which he refers.
As the words are commonly translated, we might imagine that he was not
familiar with them, for all the translators make him speak of not being
able to draw any extracts from them for his own history. Thus Valesius:
*nec narrationem ullam libris nostris intexere possumus;* Stroth: “noch
etwas darauserzählen kann”; Closs: “noch etwas daraus anführen können”;
Crusè: “we can neither insert the time nor any extracts in our History.”
The Greek of the whole sentence reads, <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.x.xxviii-p9.1"></span>ὧ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.x.xxviii-p9.2"></span>ν διὰ τὸ μηδεμίαν žχειν ἀφορμὴν οὐχ οἷ&
231·ν τε οὔτε τοὺς χρόνους παραδοῦναι γραφῇ, οὔθ᾽ ἱστορίας μνήμην
ὑποσημήνασθαι</span>, which seems to mean simply that their works
contain no information which enables him to give the dates of the
authors, or to recount anything about their lives; that is, they contain
no personal allusions. This is quite different from saying that he was
not acquainted with the works; in fact, had he not been quite familiar
with them, he could not have made such a broad statement. He seems to
have searched them for personal notices, and to have failed in the
search. Whether these words of Eusebius apply to all the works already
mentioned, or only to the <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.x.xxviii-p9.3"></span>μυρίων ἄλλων</span> just referred to,
cannot be certainly determined. The latter seems most natural; but even
if the reference be only to those last mentioned, there is every reason
to think that the words are just as true of the writings of Heraclitus,
Maximus, and the others, for he tells us nothing about their lives, nor
the time in which they lived, but introduces them in the most general
terms, as “ancient ecclesiastical men.” There seems, therefore, no good
reason for connecting these writers with the reign of Commodus, rather
than with any other reign of the late second or of the third century. It
must be noticed that Eusebius does not say that “these men lived at this
time”; he simply mentions them in this connection because it is a
convenient place, and perhaps because there were indications which led
him to think they could not have lived early in the second or late in
the third century. It is quite possible, as suggested in the previous
note, that the works of the writers whose names are mentioned in this
chapter were collected in a single volume, and that thus Eusebius was
led to class them all together, although the subjects of their works
were by no means the same, and their dates may have been widely
different.

<span id="fn_1733"></span>[246:1734](2010168.htm#fr_1733.md) <span
id="iii.x.xxviii-p9.4"></span>

<span id="iii.x.xxviii-p10"></span> Eusebius mentioned first those works
whose authors’ names were known to him, but now adds that he is
acquainted with many other writings which bear the name of no author. He
claims, however, that the works testify to their authors’ orthodoxy, and
he seems to imply, by this statement, that he has convinced himself of
their orthodoxy by a personal examination of them.
