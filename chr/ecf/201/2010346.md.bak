<span id="iv.iii.i.v-p1"></span> §5. *Third Five Years.*

<span id="iv.iii.i.v-p2"></span>About the time of his decennial
celebration, <span id="fr_3027"></span>[3028](#fn_3027.md) his sons Crispus
and Constantine, and Licinius, son of Licinius, were made Cæsars. The
peace between the emperors continued during the whole of this period.
There was more or less fighting with the frontier tribes, Crispus, e.g.,
defeating the Franks in 320 (Naz. *Paneg.* c. 3. 17?), but the main
interest of the period does not lie in its wars. It was a period of
legislation and internal improvement (cf. Laws of 319, 320, 321,
collected in Clinton, 1, p. 9; also De Broglie, I. 1, 296–97). Early in
the period he was at Milan, where the Donatist matter, which had been
dragging along since 311, came up for final settlement (cf. note,
above). He was also at one time or another at Arles and at Rome, but the
latter and greater part of the period was spent mainly in Dacia and
Pannonia (cf. Laws, as above). The close of his fifteen years was
celebrated somewhat prematurely at Rome, in the absence of Constantine,
by the oration of Nazarius (cf. Naz. *Paneg.*).
