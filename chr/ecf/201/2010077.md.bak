<span id="iii.viii.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.viii.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—</span>*The Signs which
preceded the War.*

<span id="iii.viii.viii-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.viii.viii-p2.1"></span>Taking</span>, then, the work of this
author, read what he records in the sixth book of his History. His words
are as follows: <span id="fr_655"></span>[656](#fn_655.md) “Thus were the
miserable people won over at this time by the impostors and false
prophets; <span id="fr_656"></span>[657](#fn_656.md) but they did not heed
nor give credit to the visions and signs that foretold the approaching
desolation. On the contrary, as if struck by lightning, and as if
possessing neither eyes nor understanding, they slighted the
proclamations of God.

<span id="iii.viii.viii-p5"></span>2. At one time a star, in form like a
sword, stood over the city, and a comet, which lasted for a whole year;
and again before the revolt and before the disturbances that led to the
war, when the people were gathered for the feast of unleavened bread, on
the eighth of the month Xanthicus, <span
id="fr_657"></span>[658](#fn_657.md) at the ninth hour of the night, so
great a light shone about the altar and the temple that it seemed to be
bright day; and this continued for half an hour. This seemed to the
unskillful a good sign, but was interpreted by the sacred scribes as
portending those events which very soon took place.

<span id="iii.viii.viii-p7"></span>3. And at the same feast a cow, led
by the high priest to be sacrificed, brought forth a lamb in the midst
of the temple.

<span id="iii.viii.viii-p8"></span>4. And the eastern gate of the inner
temple, which was of bronze and very massive, and which at evening was
closed with difficulty by twenty men, and rested upon iron-bound beams,
and had bars sunk deep in the ground, was seen at the sixth hour of the
night to open of itself.

<span id="iii.viii.viii-p9"></span>5. And not many days after the feast,
on the twenty-first of the month Artemisium, <span
id="fr_658"></span>[659](#fn_658.md) a certain marvelous vision was seen
which passes belief. The prodigy might seem fabulous were it not related
by those who saw it, and were not the calamities which followed
deserving of such signs. For before the setting of the sun chariots and
armed troops were seen throughout the whole region in mid-air, wheeling
through the clouds and encircling the cities.

<span id="iii.viii.viii-p11"></span>6. And at the feast which is called
Pentecost, when the priests entered the temple at night, as was their
custom, to perform the services, they said that at first they perceived
a movement and a noise, and afterward a voice as of a great multitude,
saying, ‘Let us go hence.’ <span id="fr_659"></span>[660](#fn_659.md)

<span id="iii.viii.viii-p13"></span>7. But what follows is still more
terrible; for a certain Jesus, the son of Ananias, a common countryman,
four years before the war, <span id="fr_660"></span>[661](#fn_660.md) when
the city was particularly <span id="page_143">p. 143</span> <span
id="iii.viii.viii-Page_143"></span>prosperous and peaceful, came to the
feast, at which it was customary for all to make tents at the temple to
the honor of God, <span id="fr_661"></span>[662](#fn_661.md) and suddenly
began to cry out: ‘A voice from the east, a voice from the west, a voice
from the four winds, a voice against Jerusalem and the temple, a voice
against bridegrooms and brides, a voice against all the people.’ Day and
night he went through all the alleys crying thus.

<span id="iii.viii.viii-p16"></span>8. But certain of the more
distinguished citizens, vexed at the ominous cry, seized the man and
beat him with many stripes. But without uttering a word in his own
behalf, or saying anything in particular to those that were present, he
continued to cry out in the same words as before.

<span id="iii.viii.viii-p17"></span>9. And the rulers, thinking, as was
true, that the man was moved by a higher power, brought him before the
Roman governor. <span id="fr_662"></span>[663](#fn_662.md) And then, though
he was scourged to the bone, he neither made supplication nor shed
tears, but, changing his voice to the most lamentable tone possible, he
answered each stroke with the words, ‘Woe, woe unto Jerusalem.’”

<span id="iii.viii.viii-p19"></span>10. The same historian records
another fact still more wonderful than this. He says <span
id="fr_663"></span>[664](#fn_663.md) that a certain oracle was found in
their sacred writings which declared that at that time a certain person
should go forth from their country to rule the world. He himself
understood that this was fulfilled in Vespasian.

<span id="iii.viii.viii-p21"></span>11. But Vespasian did not rule the
whole world, but only that part of it which was subject to the Romans.
With better right could it be applied to Christ; to whom it was said by
the Father, “Ask of me, and I will give thee the heathen for thine
inheritance, and the ends of the earth for thy possession.” <span
id="fr_664"></span>[665](#fn_664.md) At that very time, indeed, the voice
of his holy apostles “went throughout all the earth, and their words to
the end of the world.” <span id="fr_665"></span>[666](#fn_665.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_655"></span>[142:656](2010077.htm#fr_655.md) <span
id="iii.viii.viii-p2.2"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.viii-p3"></span> Josephus, *B. J.* Bk. VI. chap. 5,
§3.

<span id="fn_656"></span>[142:657](2010077.htm#fr_656.md) <span
id="iii.viii.viii-p3.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.viii-p4"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.viii.viii-p4.1"></span>καταψευδόμενοι τοῦ θεοῦ</span>. In the
previous paragraph Josephus says that a great many false prophets were
suborned by the tyrants to impose on the people. It is to these false
prophets therefore that he refers here, and I have consequently felt at
liberty thus to translate the Greek word given above, instead of
rendering merely “liars against God” (as Crusè does), which is
indefinite, and might have various meanings.

<span id="fn_657"></span>[142:658](2010077.htm#fr_657.md) <span
id="iii.viii.viii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.viii-p6"></span> The feast referred to is the feast
of the Passover. The Greek name of the month used here is <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.viii.viii-p6.1"></span>ξανθικός</span>,
which was the name of a Macedonian month corresponding to our April.
According to Whiston, Josephus regularly used this name for the Jewish
month Nisan (the first month of the Jewish year), in which case this
event took place six days before the Passover, which began on the 14th
of Nisan.

<span id="fn_658"></span>[142:659](2010077.htm#fr_658.md) <span
id="iii.viii.viii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.viii-p10"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.viii.viii-p10.1"></span>᾽</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.viii.viii-p10.2"></span>Αρτεμίσιος</span>. According to Liddell
and Scott, this was a Spartan and Macedonian month corresponding to a
part of the ninth Attic month (<span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.viii.viii-p10.3"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.viii.viii-p10.4"></span>λαφηβολιών</span>), which in turn
corresponded to the latter part of our March and the early part of
April. According to Wieseler, Josephus used the word to denote the
second month of the Jewish year, the month Iyar.

<span id="fn_659"></span>[142:660](2010077.htm#fr_659.md) <span
id="iii.viii.viii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.viii-p12"></span> The majority of the <span
class="c13"><span id="iii.viii.viii-p12.1"></span>mss.</span> of
Eusebius read <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.viii.viii-p12.2"></span>μεταβαίνομεν</span>, “we go hence.” But
at least one of the best <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.viii.viii-p12.3"></span>mss.</span> and a majority of the <span
class="c13"><span id="iii.viii.viii-p12.4"></span>mss.</span> of
Josephus, supported by Rufinus and Jerome (who render *migremus*), read
<span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.viii.viii-p12.5"></span>μεταβαίνωμεν</span>, “let us go hence,”
and I have followed Stephanus, Valesius, Stroth, and the English and
German translators in adopting that reading.

<span id="fn_660"></span>[142:661](2010077.htm#fr_660.md) <span
id="iii.viii.viii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.viii-p14"></span> That is, in 62 <span
class="c13"><span id="iii.viii.viii-p14.1"></span>a.d.</span> for,
according to Josephus, the war began in 66 <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.viii.viii-p14.2"></span>a.d.</span> A little further on,
Josephus says that he continued his cry for seven years and five months,
when he was slain during the siege of Jerusalem. This shows that he is
here, as well as elsewhere, reckoning the date of the beginning of the
war as 66 <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.viii.viii-p14.3"></span>a.d.</span>

<span id="fn_661"></span>[143:662](2010077.htm#fr_661.md) <span
id="iii.viii.viii-p14.4"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.viii-p15"></span> That is, the Feast of Tabernacles,
which began on the fifteenth day of the seventh month of the Jewish
year, and continued seven days.

<span id="fn_662"></span>[143:663](2010077.htm#fr_662.md) <span
id="iii.viii.viii-p17.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.viii-p18"></span> This was Albinus, as we should know
from the date of the event, and as Josephus directly states in the
context. He was procurator from 61 or 62 to 64 <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.viii.viii-p18.1"></span>a.d.</span> See above, Bk. II. chap. 23,
note 35, and chap. 22, note 1.

<span id="fn_663"></span>[143:664](2010077.htm#fr_663.md) <span

<span id="iii.viii.viii-p20"></span> See Josephus, *B. J.* VI. 5.4, and
cf. *ibid*. III. 8. 9.
