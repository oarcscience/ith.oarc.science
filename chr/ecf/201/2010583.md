<span id="iv.vi.iii.lxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.lxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter LXIV</span>.—*Constantine’s
Edict against the Heretics.*

<span id="iv.vi.iii.lxiv-p2"></span>“<span class="c13"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.lxiv-p2.1"></span>Victor Constantinus, Maximus
Augustus</span>, to the heretics.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.lxiv-p3"></span>“Understand now, by this present
statute, ye Novatians, Valentinians, Marcionites, Paulians, ye who are
called Cataphrygians, <span id="fr_3303"></span>[3304](#fn_3303) and all
ye who devise and support heresies by means of your private assemblies,
with what a tissue of falsehood and vanity, with what destructive and
venomous errors, your doctrines are inseparably interwoven; so that
through you the healthy soul is stricken with disease, and the living
becomes the prey of everlasting death. Ye haters and enemies of truth
and life, in league with destruction! All your counsels are opposed to
the truth, but familiar with deeds of baseness; full of absurdities and
fictions: and by these ye frame falsehoods, oppress the innocent, and
withhold the light from them that believe. Ever trespassing under the
mask of godliness, ye fill all things with defilement: ye pierce the
pure and guileless conscience with deadly wounds, while ye withdraw, one
may almost say, the very light of day from the eyes of men. But why
should I particularize, when to speak of your criminality as it deserves
demands more time and leisure than I can give? For so long and
unmeasured is the catalogue of your offenses, so hateful and altogether
atrocious are they, that a single day would not suffice to recount them
all. And, indeed, it is well to turn one’s ears and eyes from such a
subject, lest by a description of each particular evil, the pure
sincerity and freshness of one’s own faith be impaired. Why then do I
still bear with such abounding evil; especially since this protracted
clemency is the cause that some who were sound are become tainted with
this pestilent disease? Why not at once strike, as it were, at the root
of so great a mischief by a public manifestation of displeasure?
