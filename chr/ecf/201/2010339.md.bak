<span id="iv.ii-p3"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.ii-p3.1"></span>In</span> accordance with the instruction of the
editor-in-chief the following work consists of a revision of the Bagster
translation of Eusebius’ “Life of Constantine,” Constantine’s “Oration
to the Saints,” and Eusebius’ “Oration in Praise of Constantine,” with
somewhat extended Prolegomena and limited notes, especial attention
being given in the Prolegomena to a study of the *Character* of
Constantine. In the work of revision care has been taken so far as
possible not to destroy the style of the original translator, which
though somewhat inflated and verbose, represents perhaps all the better,
the corresponding styles of both Eusebius and Constantine, but the
number of changes really required has been considerable, and has caused
here and there a break in style in the translation, whose chief merit is
that it presents in smooth, well-rounded phrase the generalized idea of
a sentence. The work on the Prolegomena has been done as thoroughly and
originally as circumstances would permit, and has aimed to present
material in such way that the general student might get a survey of the
man Constantine; and the various problems and discussions of which he is
center. It is impossible to return special thanks to all who have given
special facilities for work, but the peculiar kindness of various
helpers in the *<span id="iv.ii-p3.2"></span>Bibliothèque de la Ville*
at Lyons demands at least the recognition of individualized
thanksgiving.
