<span id="iv.vi.i.xlvi-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.xlvi-p2.1"></span>Thus</span> the emperor in all his actions
honored God, the Controller of all things, and exercised an
unwearied <span id="fr_3145"></span>[3146](#fn_3145.md) oversight over His
churches. And God requited him, by subduing all barbarous nations under
his feet, so that he was able everywhere to raise trophies over his
enemies: and He proclaimed him as conqueror to all mankind, and made him
a terror to his adversaries: not indeed that this was his natural
character, since he was rather the meekest, and gentlest, and most
benevolent of men.
