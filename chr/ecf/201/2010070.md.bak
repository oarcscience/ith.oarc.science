<span id="iii.viii.i-p4"></span> According to Lipsius, the legends
concerning the labors of the apostles in various countries were all
originally connected with that of their separation at Jerusalem, which
is as old as the second century. But this separation was put at various
dates by different traditions, varying from immediately after the
Ascension to twenty-four years later. A lost book, referred to by the
*Decretum Gelasii* as *Liber qui appellatus sortes Apostolorum
apocryphus,* very likely contained the original tradition, and an
account of the fate of the apostles, and was probably of Gnostic or
Manichean origin. The efforts to derive from the varying traditions any
trustworthy particulars as to the apostles themselves is almost wholly
vain. The various traditions not only assign different fields of labor
to the different apostles, but also give different lists of the apostles
themselves. See Lipsius’ article on the *Apocryphal Acts of the
Apostles* in Smith and Wace’s *Dict. of Christ. Biog.* I. p. 17 sqq. The
extant Apocryphal Gospels, Acts, Apocalypses, &c., are translated in the
*Ante-Nicene Fathers,* Vol. VIII. p. 361 sqq. Lipsius states that,
according to the oldest form of the tradition, the apostles were divided
into three groups: first, Peter and Andrew, Matthew and Bartholomew, who
were said to have preached in the region of the Black Sea; second,
Thomas, Thaddeus, and Simeon, the Canaanite, in Parthia; third, John and
Philip, in Asia Minor.

<span id="fn_563"></span>[132:564](2010070.htm#fr_563.md) <span
id="iii.viii.i-p4.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.i-p5"></span> Parthia, in the time of the apostles,
was an independent kingdom, extending from the Indus to the Tigris, and
from the Caspian Sea to the Persian Gulf. This is the oldest form of the
tradition in regard to Thomas (see preceding note). It is found also in
the Clementine *Recognitions,* IX. 29, and in Socrates, *H. E.* I. 19.
Rufinus (*H. E.* II. 5) and Socrates (*H. E.* IV. 18) speak of Edessa as
his burial place. Later traditions extended his labors eastward as far
as India, and made him suffer martyrdom in that land; and there his
remains were exhibited down to the sixteenth century. According to the
*Martyrium Romanum,* however, his remains were brought from India to
Edessa, and from thence to Ortona, in Italy, during the Crusades. The
Syrian Christians in India called themselves Thomas-Christians; but the
name cannot be traced beyond the eighth century, and is derived,
probably, from a Nestorian missionary.

<span id="fn_564"></span>[132:565](2010070.htm#fr_564.md) <span
id="iii.viii.i-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.i-p6"></span> The name Scythia was commonly used by
the ancients, in a very loose sense, to denote all the region lying
north of the Caspian and Black Seas. But two Scythias were distinguished
in more accurate usage: a European Scythia, lying north of the Black
Sea, between the Danube and the Tanais, and an Asiatic Scythia,
extending eastward from the Ural. The former is here meant.

<span id="fn_565"></span>[132:566](2010070.htm#fr_565.md) <span
id="iii.viii.i-p6.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.i-p7"></span> The traditions respecting Andrew are
very uncertain and contradictory, though, as remarked above (note 1),
the original form, represented here, assigned as his field the region in
the neighborhood of the Black Sea. His traditional activity in Scythia
has made him the patron saint of Russia. He is also called the patron
saint of Greece, where he is reported to have been crucified; but his
activity there rests upon a late tradition. His body is said to have
been carried to Constantinople in 357 (cf. Philostorgius, *Hist.
Eccles.* III. 2), and during the Crusades transferred to Amalpæ in
Italy, in whose cathedral the remains are still shown. Andrew is in
addition the patron saint of Scotland; but the tradition of his activity
there dates back only to the eighth century (cf. Skene’s *Celtic
Scotland,* II. 221 sq.). Numerous other regions are claimed, by various
traditions, to have been the scene of his labors.

<span id="fn_566"></span>[132:567](2010070.htm#fr_566.md) <span
id="iii.viii.i-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.i-p8"></span> Proconsular Asia included only a narrow
strip of Asia Minor, lying upon the coast of the Mediterranean and
comprising Mysia, Lydia, and Caria.

<span id="fn_567"></span>[132:568](2010070.htm#fr_567.md) <span
id="iii.viii.i-p8.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.i-p9"></span> The universal testimony of antiquity
assigns John’s later life to Ephesus: e.g. Irenæus, *Adv. Hær.* III. 1.
1 and 3. 4, etc.; Clement of Alex., *Quis Dives Salvetur,* c. 42 (quoted
by Eusebius, chap. 23, below); Polycrates in his Epistle to Victor
(quoted by Eusebius in chap. 31, below, and in Bk. V. chap. 24); and
many others. The testimony of Irenæus is especially weighty, for the
series: Irenæus, the pupil of Polycarp, the pupil of John, forms a
complete chain such as we have in no other case. Such testimony, when
its force is broken by no adverse tradition, ought to be sufficient to
establish John’s residence in Ephesus beyond the shadow of a doubt, but
it has been denied by many of the critics who reject the Johannine
authorship of the fourth Gospel (e.g. Keim, Holtzmann, the author of
*Supernat. Religion,* and others), though the denial is much less
positive now than it was a few years ago. The chief arguments urged
against the residence of John in Ephesus are two, both a *silentio:*
first, Clement in his first Epistle to the Corinthians speaks of the
apostles in such a way as to seem to imply that they were all dead;
secondly, in the Ignatian Epistles, Paul is mentioned, but not John,
which is certainly very remarkable, as one is addressed to Ephesus
itself. In reply it may be said that such an interpretation of Clement’s
words is not necessary, and that the omission of John in the epistles of
Ignatius becomes perfectly natural if the Epistles are thrown into the
time of Hadrian or into the latter part of Trajan’s reign, as they ought
to be (cf. chap. 36, note 4). In the face of the strong testimony for
John’s Ephesian residence these two objections must be overruled. The
traditional view is defended by all conservative critics as well as by
the majority even of those who deny the Johannine authorship of the
fourth Gospel (cf. especially Hilgenfeld in his *Einleitung,* and
Weizsäcker in his *Apostaliches Zeitalter*). The silence of Paul’s
epistles and of the Acts proves that John cannot have gone to Ephesus
until after Paul had permanently left there, and this we should
naturally expect to be the case. Upon the time of John’s banishment to
Patmos, see Bk. III. chap. 18, note 1. Tradition reports that he lived
until the reign of Trajan (98–117). Cf. Irenæus, II. 22. 5 and III. 3.
4.

<span id="iii.viii.i-p10"></span> Origen in this extract seems to be
uncertain how long John remained in Ephesus and when he died.

<span id="fn_569"></span>[132:570](2010070.htm#fr_569.md) <span
id="iii.viii.i-p11.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.i-p12"></span> The language of Origen (<span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.viii.i-p12.1"></span>κεκηρυχέναι
žοικεν</span>, instead of <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.viii.i-p12.2"></span>λόγος žχει</span> or <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.viii.i-p12.3"></span>παρ€δοσις
περιέχει</span>) seems to imply that he is recording not a tradition,
but a conclusion drawn from the first Epistle of Peter, which was known
to him, and in which these places are mentioned. Such a tradition did,
however, exist quite early. Cf. e.g. the Syriac *Doctrina Apostolorum*
(ed. Cureton) and the Gnostic *Acts of Peter and Andrew.* The former
assigns to Peter, Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia, in addition to Galatia
and Pontus, and cannot therefore, rest solely upon the first Epistle of
Peter, which does not mention the first three places. All the places
assigned to Peter are portions of the field of Paul, who in all the
traditions of this class is completely crowded out and his field given
to other apostles, showing the Jewish origin of the traditions. Upon
Peter’s activity in Rome and his death there, see Bk. II. chap. 25, note
7.

<span id="fn_571"></span>[132:572](2010070.htm#fr_571.md) <span
id="iii.viii.i-p13.2"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.i-p14"></span> Origen is the first to record that
Peter was crucified with his head downward, but the tradition afterward
became quite common. It is of course not impossible, but the absence of
any reference to it by earlier Fathers (even by Tertullian, who mentions
the crucifixion), and its decidedly legendary character, render it
exceedingly doubtful.

<span id="fn_572"></span>[132:573](2010070.htm#fr_572.md) <span

Illyricum was a Roman province lying along the eastern coast of the
Adriatic.

<span id="iii.viii.i-p17"></span> This fragment of Origen has been
preserved by no one else. It is impossible to tell where the quotation
begins—whether with the words “Thomas according to tradition received
Parthia,” as I have given it, or with the words “Peter appears to have
preached,” etc., as Bright gives it.
