<span id="iii.vii.xxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.vii.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXII.—</span>*Paul having been
sent bound from Judea to Rome, made his Defense, and was acquitted of
every Charge.*

<span id="iii.vii.xxiii-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.vii.xxiii-p2.1"></span>Festus <span
id="fr_468"></span>[469](#fn_468.md) </span> was sent by Nero to be Felix’s
successor. Under him Paul, having made his defense, was sent bound to
Rome. <span id="fr_469"></span>[470](#fn_469.md) Aristarchus was with him,
whom he also somewhere in his epistles quite naturally calls his
fellow-prisoner. <span id="fr_470"></span>[471](#fn_470.md) <span
id="page_124">p. 124</span> <span id="iii.vii.xxiii-Page_124"></span>And
Luke, who wrote the Acts of the Apostles, <span
id="fr_471"></span>[472](#fn_471.md) brought his history to a close at this
point, after stating that Paul spent two whole years at Rome as a
prisoner at large, and preached the word of God without restraint. <span
id="fr_472"></span>[473](#fn_472.md)

<span id="iii.vii.xxiii-p8"></span>2. Thus after he had made his defense
it is said that the apostle was sent again upon the ministry of
preaching, <span id="fr_473"></span>[474](#fn_473.md) and that upon coming
to the same city a second time he suffered martyrdom. <span
id="fr_474"></span>[475](#fn_474.md) In this imprisonment he wrote his
second epistle to Timothy, <span id="fr_475"></span>[476](#fn_475.md) in
which he mentions his first defense and his impending death.

<span id="iii.vii.xxiii-p12"></span>3. But hear his testimony on these
matters: “At my first answer,” he says, “no man stood with me, but all
men forsook me: I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge.
Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me
the preaching might be fully known, and that all the Gentiles might
hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.” <span
id="fr_476"></span>[477](#fn_476.md)

<span id="iii.vii.xxiii-p14"></span>4. He plainly indicates in these
words that on the former occasion, in order that the preaching might be
fulfilled by him, he was rescued from the mouth of the lion, referring,
in this expression, to Nero, as is probable on account of the latter’s
cruelty. He did not therefore afterward add the similar statement, “He
will rescue me from the mouth of the lion”; for he saw in the spirit
that his end would not be long delayed.

<span id="iii.vii.xxiii-p15"></span>5. Wherefore he adds to the words,
“And he delivered me from the mouth of the lion,” this sentence: “The
Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me unto
his heavenly kingdom,” <span id="fr_477"></span>[478](#fn_477.md)
indicating his speedy martyrdom; which he also foretells still more
clearly in the same epistle, when he writes, “For I am now ready to be
offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.” <span
id="fr_478"></span>[479](#fn_478.md)

<span id="iii.vii.xxiii-p18"></span>6. In his second epistle to Timothy,
moreover, he indicates that Luke was with him when he wrote, <span
id="fr_479"></span>[480](#fn_479.md) but at his first defense not even
he. <span id="fr_480"></span>[481](#fn_480.md) Whence it is probable that
Luke wrote the Acts of the Apostles at that time, continuing his history
down to the period when he was with Paul. <span
id="fr_481"></span>[482](#fn_481.md)

<span id="iii.vii.xxiii-p22"></span>7. But these things have been
adduced by us to show that Paul’s martyrdom did not take place at the
time of that Roman sojourn which Luke <span id="page_125">p. 125</span>
<span id="iii.vii.xxiii-Page_125"></span>records.

<span id="iii.vii.xxiii-p23"></span>8. It is probable indeed that as
Nero was more disposed to mildness in the beginning, Paul’s defense of
his doctrine was more easily received; but that when he had advanced to
the commission of lawless deeds of daring, he made the apostles as well
as others the subjects of his attacks. <span

id="iii.vii.xxiii-p2.2"></span>

<span id="iii.vii.xxiii-p3"></span> The exact year of the accession of
Festus is not known, but it is known that his death occurred before the
summer of 62 <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.vii.xxiii-p3.1"></span>a.d.</span>; for at that time his
successor, Albinus, was already procurator, as we can see from Josephus,
*B. J.* VI. 5. 3. But from the events recorded by Josephus as happening
during his term of office, we know he must have been procurator at least
a year; his accession, therefore, took place certainly as early as 61
<span class="c13"><span id="iii.vii.xxiii-p3.2"></span>a.d.</span>, and
probably at least a year earlier, i.e. in 60 <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.vii.xxiii-p3.3"></span>a.d.</span>, the date fixed by Wieseler.
The widest possible margin for his accession is from 59–61. Upon this
whole question, see Wieseler, p. 66 sqq. Festus died while in office. He
seems to have been a just and capable governor,—in this quite a contrast
to his predecessor.

<span id="fn_469"></span>[123:470](2010064.htm#fr_469.md) <span
id="iii.vii.xxiii-p3.4"></span>

<span id="iii.vii.xxiii-p4"></span> [Acts
xxv](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#000.md)<span
id="iii.vii.xxiii-p4.1"></span>. sqq. The determination of the year in
which Paul was sent as a prisoner to Rome depends in part upon the
determination of the year of Festus’ accession. He was in Rome (which he
reached in the spring) at least two years before the Neronic persecution
(June, 64 <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.vii.xxiii-p4.2"></span>a.d.</span>), therefore as early as 62
<span class="c13"><span id="iii.vii.xxiii-p4.3"></span>a.d.</span> He
was sent from Cæsarea the previous autumn, therefore as early as the
autumn of 61. If Festus became procurator in 61, this must have been the
date. But if, as is probable, Festus became procurator in 60, then Paul
was sent to Rome in the autumn of the same year, and reached Rome in the
spring of 61. This is now the commonly accepted date; but the year 62
cannot be shut out (cf. Wieseler, *ibid.*). Wieseler shows conclusively
that Festus cannot have become procurator before 60 <span
class="c13"><span id="iii.vii.xxiii-p4.4"></span>a.d.</span>, and hence
Paul cannot have been taken to Rome before the fall of that year.

<span id="iii.vii.xxiii-p9"></span> Eusebius is the first writer to
record the release of Paul from a first, and his martyrdom during a
second Roman imprisonment. He introduces the statement with the formula
<span class="Greek"><span id="iii.vii.xxiii-p9.1"></span>λόγος
žχει</span>, which indicates probably that he has only an oral tradition
as his authority, and his efforts to establish the fact by exegetical
arguments show how weak the tradition was. Many maintain that Eusebius
follows no tradition here, but records simply his own conclusion formed
from a study of the Pastoral Epistles, which apparently necessitate a
second imprisonment. But were this the case, he would hardly have used
the formula <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vii.xxiii-p9.2"></span>λόγος žχει</span>. The report may have
arisen solely upon exegetical grounds, but it can hardly have originated
with Eusebius himself. In accordance with this tradition, Eusebius, in
his *Chron.,* gives the date of Paul’s death as 67 <span
class="c13"><span id="iii.vii.xxiii-p9.3"></span>a.d.</span> Jerome (*de
vir. ill.* 5) and other later writers follow Eusebius (though Jerome
gives the date as 68 instead of 67), and the tradition soon became
firmly established (see below, chap. 25, note 5). Scholars are greatly
divided as to the fact of a second imprisonment. Nearly all that defend
the genuineness of the Pastoral Epistles assume a second imprisonment,
though some (e.g. Wieseler, Ebrard, Reuss and others) defend the
epistles while assuming only one imprisonment; but this is very
difficult. On the other hand, most opponents of the epistles (e.g. the
Tübingen critics and the majority of the new critical school) deny the
second imprisonment. As to the place where Paul spent the
interval—supposing him to have been released—there is again a difference
of opinion. The Pastoral Epistles, if assumed to be genuine, seem to
necessitate another visit to the Orient. But for such a visit there is
no ancient tradition, although Paul himself, in the Epistle to the
Philippians, expresses his expectation of making such a visit. On the
other hand, there is an old tradition that he visited Spain (which must
of course have been during this interval, as he did not reach it before
the first imprisonment). The Muratorian Fragment (from the end of the
second century) records this tradition in a way to imply that it was
universally known. Clement of Rome (*Epistle to the Corinthians,* c. 5.)
is also claimed as a witness for such a visit, but the interpretation of
his words is doubtful, so that little weight can be laid upon his
statement. In later times the tradition of this visit to Spain dropped
out of the Church. The strongest argument against the visit is the
absence of any trace of it in Spain itself. If any church there could
have claimed the great apostle to the Gentiles as its founder, it seems
that it must have asserted its claim and the tradition have been
preserved at least in that church. This appears to the writer a fatal
argument against a journey to Spain. On the other hand, the absence of
all tradition of another journey to the Orient does not militate against
such a visit, for tradition at any place might easily preserve the fact
of a visit of the apostle, without preserving an accurate account of the
number of his visits if more than one were made. Of the defenders of the
Pastoral Epistles, that accept a second imprisonment, some assume simply
a journey to the Orient, others assume also the journey to Spain.
Between the spring of 63 <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.vii.xxiii-p9.4"></span>a.d.</span>, the time when he was
probably released, if released, and the date of his death (at the
earliest the summer of 64), there is time enough, but barely so, for
both journeys. If the date of Paul’s death be put later with Eusebius
and Jerome (as many modern critics put it), the time is of course quite
sufficient. Compare the various Lives of Paul, Commentaries, etc., and
especially, among recent works, Schaff’s *Church Hist.* I. p. 231 sqq.;
Weiss’ *Einleitung in das N. T.* p. 283 sqq.; Holtzmann’s *Einleitung,*
p. 295 sqq.; and Weizsäcker’s *Apostolisches Zeitalter,* p. 453 sqq.

id="iii.vii.xxiii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vii.xxiii-p11"></span> Eusebius looked upon the Pastoral
Epistles as undoubtedly genuine, and placed them among the
*Homologumena,* or undisputed writings (compare Bk. III. chaps. 3 and
25). The external testimony for them is very strong, but their
genuineness has, during the present century, been quite widely denied
upon internal grounds. The advanced critical scholars of Germany treat
their non-Pauline authorship as completely established, and many
otherwise conservative scholars follow their lead. It is impossible here
to give the various arguments for or against their genuineness; we may
refer the reader particularly to Holtzmann’s *Die Pastoralbriefe,
kritisch und exegetisch behandelt* (1880), and to his *Einleitung*
(1886), for the most complete presentation of the case against the
genuineness; and to Weiss’ *Einleitung in das N. T.* (1886), p. 286
sqq., and to his Commentary on the Pastoral Epistles, in the fifth
edition of the Meyer Series, for a defense of their genuineness, and
also to Woodruff’s article in the *Andover Review,* October, 1886, for a
brief and somewhat popular discussion of the subject. The second epistle
must have been written latest of all Paul’s epistles, just before his
death,—at the termination of his second captivity, or of his first, if
his second be denied.

<span id="iii.vii.xxiii-p21"></span> This is a very commonly accepted
opinion among conservative commentators, who thus explain the lack of
mention of the persecution of Nero and of the death of Paul. On the
other hand, some who accept Luke’s authorship of the Acts, put the
composition into the latter part of the century and explain the omission
of the persecution and the death of Paul from the object of the work,
e.g. Weiss, who dates the Gospel of Luke between 70 and 80, and thus
brings the Acts down to a still later date (see his *Einleitung,* p. 585
sqq.). It is now becoming quite generally admitted that Luke’s Gospel
was written after the destruction of Jerusalem, and if this be so, the
Acts must have been written still later. There is in fact no reason for
supposing the book to have been written at the point of time at which
its account of Paul ceases. The design of the book (its text is found in
the eighth verse of the first chapter) was to give an account of the
progress of the Church from Jerusalem to Rome, not to write the life of
Paul. The record of Paul’s death at the close of the book would have
been quite out of harmony with this design, and would have formed a
decided anti-climax, as the author was wise enough to understand. He was
writing, not a life of Paul, nor of any apostle or group of apostles,
but a history of the planting of the Church of Christ. The advanced
critics, who deny that the Acts were written by a pupil of Paul, of
course put its composition much later,—some into the time of Domitian,
most into the second century. But even such critics admit the
genuineness of certain portions of the book (the celebrated “We”
passages), and the old Tübingen theory of intentional misrepresentation
on the part of the author is finding less favor even among the most
radical critics.

<span id="fn_482"></span>[125:483](2010064.htm#fr_482.md) <span
id="iii.vii.xxiii-p23.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vii.xxiii-p24"></span> Whether Eusebius’ conclusion be
correct or not, it is a fact that Nero became much more cruel and
tyrannical in the latter part of his reign. The famous “first five
years,” however exaggerated the reports about them, must at least have
been of a very different character from the remainder of his reign. But
those five years of clemency and justice were past before Paul reached
Rome.
