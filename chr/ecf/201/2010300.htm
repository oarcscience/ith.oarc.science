<p class="c18"><a name="iii.xvi.iii-p2"></A>1. <span class="c13"><a name="iii.xvi.iii-p2.1"></A>After</span> this was seen the sight which had been desired and prayed for by us all; feasts of dedication in the cities and consecrations of the newly built houses of prayer took place, bishops assembled, foreigners came together from abroad, mutual love was exhibited between people and people, the members of Christ&#146;s body were united in complete harmony.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.xvi.iii-p3"></A>2. Then was fulfilled the prophetic utterance which mystically foretold what was to take place: &#8220;Bone to bone and joint to joint,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2811"></A><A HREF="#fn_2811"><FONT SIZE="1">2812</FONT></A>
 and whatever was truly announced in enigmatic expressions in the inspired passage.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.xvi.iii-p5"></A>3. And there was one energy of the Divine Spirit pervading all the members, and one soul in all, and the same eagerness of faith, and one hymn from all in praise of the Deity. Yea, and perfect services were conducted by the prelates, the sacred rites being solemnized, and the majestic institutions of the Church observed,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2812"></A><A HREF="#fn_2812"><FONT SIZE="1">2813</FONT></A>
 here with the singing of psalms and with the reading of the words committed to us by God, and there with the performance of divine and mystic services; and the mysterious symbols of the Saviour&#146;s passion were dispensed.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.xvi.iii-p7"></A>4. At the same time people of every age, both male and female, with all the power of the mind gave honor unto God, the author of their benefits, in prayers and thanksgiving, with a joyful mind and soul. And every one of the bishops present, each to the best of his ability, delivered panegyric orations, adding luster to the assembly.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="iii.xvi.iii-p6"></A> These sentences are excellent examples of Eusebius&#146; rhetorical style, which marks the greater part of this tenth book. My endeavor has been to adhere as closely as possible to the original; and yet there are cases in which it is quite out of the question to give a literal translation without violating all grammatical laws, and in which the sense can be reproduced only by paraphrasing. The present sentence runs &#957;&#945;&#8054; &#956;&#8052;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#951;&#947;&#959;&#965;&#956;&#8051;&#957;&#969;&#957; &#7952;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#955;&#949;&#8150;&#962; &#952;&#961;&#951;&#963;&#954;&#949;&#8150;&#945;&#953;, &#7985;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#965;&#961;&#947;&#8055;&#945;&#953; &#964;&#949; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#7985;&#949;&#961;&#969;&#956;&#8051;&#957;&#969;&#957;, &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#952;&#949;&#959;&#960;&#961;&#949;&#960;&#949;&#8150;&#962; &#7952;&#954;&#954;&#955;&#951;&#963;&#8055;&#945;&#962; &#952;&#949;&#963;&#956;&#959;&#8055;.</p>
