<span id="iv.vi.ii.xxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.xxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVIII</span>.—*That God chose
Constantine to be the Minister of Blessing.*

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xxviii-p2"></span>“<span class="c13"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.xxviii-p2.1"></span>And</span> now, with such a mass of
impiety oppressing the human race, and the commonwealth in danger of
being utterly destroyed, as if by the agency of some pestilential
disease, and therefore needing powerful and effectual aid; what was the
relief, and what the remedy which the Divinity devised for these evils?
(And by Divinity is meant the one who is alone and truly God, the
possessor of almighty and eternal power: and surely it cannot be deemed
arrogance in one who has received benefits from God, to acknowledge them
in the loftiest terms of praise.) I myself, then, was the instrument
whose services He chose, and esteemed suited for the accomplishment of
his will. Accordingly, beginning at the remote Britannic ocean, and the
regions where, according to the law of nature, the sun sinks beneath the
horizon, through the aid of divine power I banished and utterly removed
every form of evil which prevailed, in the hope that the human race,
enlightened through my instrumentality, might be recalled to a due
observance of the holy laws of God, and at the same time our most
blessed faith might prosper under the guidance of his almighty hand.
