<span id="iv.vi.ii.lxi-p3"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.lxi-p3.1"></span>In</span> this manner the emperor, like a
powerful herald of God, addressed himself by his own letter to all the
provinces, at the same time warning his subjects against
superstitious <span id="fr_3207"></span>[3208](#fn_3207.md) error, and
encouraging them in the pursuit of true godliness. But in the midst of
his joyful anticipations of the success of this measure, he received
tidings of a most serious disturbance which had invaded the peace of the
Church. This intelligence he heard with deep concern, and at once
endeavored to devise a remedy for the evil. The origin of this
disturbance may be thus described. The people of God were in a truly
flourishing state, and abounding in the practice of good works. No
terror from without assailed them, but a bright and most profound peace,
through the favor of God, encompassed his Church on every side.
Meantime, however, the spirit of envy was watching to destroy our
blessings, which at first crept in unperceived, but soon revelled in the
midst of the assemblies of the saints. At length it reached the bishops
themselves, and arrayed them in angry hostility against each other, on
pretense of a jealous regard for the doctrines of Divine truth. Hence it
was that a mighty fire was kindled as it were from a little spark, and
which, originating in the first instance in the Alexandrian
church, <span id="fr_3208"></span>[3209](#fn_3208.md) overspread the whole
of Egypt and Libya, and the further Thebaid. Eventually it extended its
ravages to the other provinces and cities of the empire; so that not
only the prelates of the churches might be seen encountering each other
in the strife of words, but the people themselves were completely
divided, some adhering to one faction and others to another. Nay, so
notorious did the scandal of these proceedings become, that the sacred
matters of inspired teaching were exposed to the most shameful ridicule
in the very theaters of the unbelievers.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.lxi-p5"></span> It was at Alexandria that the
controversy with Arius arose. He was called to account by Alexander of
Alexandria who summoned one council and then another, at which Arius and
his followers were excommunicated.
