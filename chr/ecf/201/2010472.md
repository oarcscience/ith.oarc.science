id="iv.vi.ii.xxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVII</span>.—*How the
Persecution became the Occasion of Calamities to the Aggressors.*

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xxvii-p2"></span>“<span class="c13"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.xxvii-p2.1"></span>From</span> the causes I have described,
grievous wars arose, and destructive devastations. Hence followed a
scarcity of the common necessaries of life, and a crowd of consequent
miseries: hence, too, the authors of these impieties have either met a
disastrous death of extreme suffering, or have dragged out an
ignominious existence, and confessed it to be worse than death itself,
thus receiving as it were a measure of punishment proportioned to the
heinousness of their crimes. <span id="fr_3182"></span>[3183](#fn_3182.md)
For each experienced a degree of calamity according to the blind fury
with which he had been led to combat, and as he thought, defeat the
Divine will: so that they not only felt the pressure of the ills of this
present life, but were tormented also by a most lively apprehension of
punishment in the future world. <span
