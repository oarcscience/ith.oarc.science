<span id="iii.vii.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.vii.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII.—</span>*Helen, the Queen of
the Osrhœnians.*

<span id="iii.vii.xiii-p2"></span>1.  <span
id="fr_351"></span>[352](#fn_351.md) “<span class="c13"><span
id="iii.vii.xiii-p3.1"></span>And</span> at this time <span
id="fr_352"></span>[353](#fn_352.md) it came to pass that the great
famine <span id="fr_353"></span>[354](#fn_353.md) took place in Judea, in
which the queen Helen, <span id="fr_354"></span>[355](#fn_354.md) having
purchased grain from Egypt with large sums, distributed it to the
needy.”

<span id="iii.vii.xiii-p7"></span>2. You will find this statement also
in agreement with the Acts of the Apostles, where it is said that the
disciples at Antioch, “each according to his ability, determined to send
relief to the brethren that dwelt in Judea; which also they did, and
sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Paul.” <span
id="fr_355"></span>[356](#fn_355.md)

<span id="iii.vii.xiii-p9"></span>3. But splendid monuments <span
id="fr_356"></span>[357](#fn_356.md) of this Helen, of whom the historian
has made mention, are still shown in the suburbs of the city which is
now called Ælia. <span id="fr_357"></span>[358](#fn_357.md) But she is said
to have been queen of the Adiabeni. <span
id="fr_358"></span>[359](#fn_358.md)

<span id="iii.vii.xiii-p5"></span> Josephus had already mentioned this
famine in the same book of his *Ant.,* chap. 2, §5.

id="iii.vii.xiii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vii.xiii-p6"></span> Josephus gives an extensive account
of this Helen and of her son Izates in the *Ant.* XX. 2. Helen was the
wife of the king Monabazus of Adiabene, and the mother of Izates, his
successor. Both Izates and Helen embraced the Jewish religion, and the
latter happening to come to Jerusalem in the time of the famine, did a
great deal to relieve the distress, and was seconded in her benefactions
by her son. After their death the bones of both mother and son were
brought to Jerusalem and buried just outside of the walls, where Helen
had erected three pyramids (Jos. *Ant.* XX. 4. 3).

Paul. But the change made by Eusebius is a very natural one.

<span id="iii.vii.xiii-p10"></span> “Pausanias (*in Arcadicis*) speaks
of these great monuments of Helen and compares them to the tomb of
Mausolus. Jerome, too, testifies that they were standing in his time.
Helen had besides a palace in Jerusalem” (Stroth).

<span id="fn_357"></span>[113:358](2010054.htm#fr_357.md) <span
id="iii.vii.xiii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vii.xiii-p11"></span> Ælia was the heathen city built on
the site of Jerusalem by Hadrian (see below, Bk. IV. chap. 6).

<span id="fn_358"></span>[113:359](2010054.htm#fr_358.md) <span
id="iii.vii.xiii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vii.xiii-p12"></span> Adiabene was probably a small
province lying between the Tigris, Lycus, and the Gordiæan Mountains
(see Dion Cassius, LXVIII.), but before the time of Pliny, according to
Vaux (in Smith’s *Dict. of Greek and Roman Geography*), the word was
used in a wider sense to indicate Assyria in general (see Pliny, *H. N.*
VI. 12, and Ammianus Marcellinus, XXIII. 6). Izates was king of Adiabene
in the narrower sense.
