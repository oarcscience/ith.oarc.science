id="iv.vi.ii.lxxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter LXXIII</span>.—*The Controversy
continues without Abatement, even after the Receipt of This Letter.*

<span id="iv.vi.ii.lxxiii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.lxxiii-p2.1"></span>In</span> this manner the pious emperor
endeavored by means of the foregoing letter to promote the peace of the
Church of God. And the excellent man <span
id="fr_3221"></span>[3222](#fn_3221.md) to whom it was intrusted performed
his part not merely by communicating the letter itself, but also by
seconding the views of him who sent it; for he was, as I have said, in
all respects a person of pious character. The evil, however, was greater
than could be remedied by a single letter, insomuch that the acrimony of
the contending parties continually increased, and the effects of the
mischief extended to all the Eastern provinces. These things jealousy
and some evil spirit who looked with an envious eye on the prosperity of
the Church, wrought.
