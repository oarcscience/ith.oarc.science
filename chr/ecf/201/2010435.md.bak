id="iv.vi.i.l-p1.1"></span>Chapter L</span>.—*How Licinius attempted a
Conspiracy against Constantine.*

<span id="iv.vi.i.l-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.l-p2.1"></span>Accordingly</span> he engaged in an
implacable war against his benefactor, altogether regardless of the laws
of friendship, the obligation of oaths, the ties of kindred, and already
existing treaties. For the most benignant emperor had given him a proof
of sincere affection in bestowing on him the hand of his sister, thus
granting him the privilege of a place in family relationship and his own
ancient imperial descent, and investing him also with the rank and
dignity of his colleague in the empire. <span
id="fr_3150"></span>[3151](#fn_3150.md) But the other took the very
opposite course, employing himself in machinations against his superior,
and devising various means to repay his benefactor with injuries. At
first, pretending friendship, he did all things by guile and treachery,
expecting thus to succeed in concealing his designs; but God enabled his
servant to detect the schemes thus devised in darkness. Being
discovered, however, in his first attempts, he had recourse to fresh
frauds; at one time pretending friendship, at another claiming the
protection of solemn treaties. Then suddenly violating every engagement,
and again beseeching pardon by embassies, yet after all shamefully
violating his word, he at last declared open war, and with desperate
infatuation resolved thenceforward to carry arms against God himself,
whose worshiper he knew the emperor to be.

gloss from the *Church History,* 10. 8. Compare rendering of McGiffert.
Molzberger renders “and left him in complete possession of the portions
of the kingdom which had fallen to his lot.”
