<span id="iii.xiv.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xiv.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI.</span>

<span id="iii.xiv.vii-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xiv.vii-p2.1"></span>In</span> the fourth year of the
persecution against us, on the twelfth day before the Kalends of
December, which is the twentieth day of the month Dius, <span
id="fr_2651"></span>[2652](#fn_2651.md) on the day before the
Sabbath, <span id="fr_2652"></span>[2653](#fn_2652.md) while the tyrant
Maximinus was present and giving magnificent shows in honor of his
birthday, the following event, truly worthy of record, occurred in the
city of Cæsarea.

<span id="iii.xiv.vii-p5"></span>2. As it was an ancient custom to
furnish the spectators more splendid shows when the emperors were
present than at other times, new and foreign spectacles taking the place
of the customary amusements, such as animals brought from India or
Ethiopia or other places, or men who could astonish the beholders with
skillful bodily exercises,—it was necessary at this time, as the emperor
was giving the exhibition, to add to the shows something more wonderful.
And what should this be?

<span id="iii.xiv.vii-p6"></span>3. A witness of our doctrine was
brought into the midst and endured the contest for the true and only
religion. This was Agapius, who, as we have stated a little above, <span
id="fr_2653"></span>[2654](#fn_2653.md) was, with Thecla, the second to be
thrown to the wild beasts for food. He had also, three times and more,
marched with malefactors from the prison to the arena; and every time,
after threats from the judge, whether in compassion or in hope that he
might change his mind, had been reserved for other conflicts. But the
emperor being present, he was brought out at this time, as if he had
been appropriately reserved for this occasion, until the very word of
the Saviour should be fulfilled in him, which through divine knowledge
he declared to his disciples, that they should be brought before kings
on account of their testimony unto him. <span
id="fr_2654"></span>[2655](#fn_2654.md)

<span id="iii.xiv.vii-p9"></span>4. He was taken into the midst of the
arena with a certain malefactor who they said was charged with the
murder of his master.

<span id="iii.xiv.vii-p10"></span>5. But this murderer of his master,
when he had been cast to the wild beasts, was deemed worthy of
compassion and humanity, almost like Barabbas in the time of our
Saviour. And the whole theater resounded with shouts and cries of
approval, because the murderer was humanely saved by the emperor, and
deemed worthy of honor and freedom.

<span id="iii.xiv.vii-p11"></span>6. But the athlete of religion was
first summoned by the tyrant and promised liberty if he would deny his
profession. But he testified with a loud voice that, not for any fault,
but for the religion of the Creator of the universe, he would readily
and with pleasure endure whatever might be inflicted upon him.

<span id="iii.xiv.vii-p12"></span>7. Having said this, he joined the
deed to the word, and rushed to meet a bear which had been let loose
against him, surrendering himself most cheerfully to be devoured by him.
After this, as he still breathed, he was cast into prison. And living
yet one day, stones <span id="page_348">p. 348</span> <span
id="iii.xiv.vii-Page_348"></span>were bound to his feet, and he was
drowned in the depths of the sea. Such was the martyrdom of Agapius.

<span id="iii.xiv.vii-p3"></span> The month Dius was the third month of
the Macedonian year, and corresponded to our November (see table on p.
403, below).

<span id="fn_2652"></span>[347:2653](2010277.htm#fr_2652.md) <span

<span id="iii.xiv.vii-p4"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xiv.vii-p4.1"></span>προσαββ€του ἡμέρᾳ</span>, i.e. on Friday,
<span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xiv.vii-p4.2"></span>προσ€ββατος</span> being sometimes used
among the Jews as a designation of that day, which was more commonly
called <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xiv.vii-p4.3"></span>παρασκευή</span> (cf. [Mark xv.
42](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#042.md)<span
id="iii.xiv.vii-p4.4"></span>). Whether it was widely used in the
Christian Church of Eusebius’ day I am unable to say (Suicer does not
give the word); but the use of it here shows that it was familiar at
least in Palestine. It is said in Kraus’ *Real-Encyclop. d. christ.
Alterth,* s.v. *Wochentage,* to occur in a decree of Constantine, quoted
in Eusebius’ *Vita Const.* IV. 18; but the text is doubtful, and at
best, the use of it there proves no more as to the prevalence of the
word than its use in the present case, for Eusebius simply gives, in his
own language, the substance of Constantine’s edict.
