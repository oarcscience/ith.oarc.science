<span id="iii.viii.x-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.viii.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter X.—</span>*The Manner in which
Josephus mentions the Divine Books.*

<span id="iii.viii.x-p2"></span>1.  <span
id="fr_674"></span>[675](#fn_674) “<span class="c13"><span
id="iii.viii.x-p65.3"></span>We</span> have not, therefore, a multitude
of books disagreeing and conflicting with one another; but we have only
twenty-two, which contain the record of all time and are justly held to
be divine.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p66"></span>2. Of these, five are by Moses, and
contain the laws and the tradi<span id="page_145">p. 145</span> <span
id="iii.viii.x-Page_145"></span>tion respecting the origin of man, and
continue the history <span id="fr_675"></span>[676](#fn_675) down to his
own death. This period embraces nearly three thousand years. <span
id="fr_676"></span>[677](#fn_676)

<span id="iii.viii.x-p69"></span>3. From the death of Moses to the death
of Artaxerxes, who succeeded Xerxes as king of Persia, the prophets that
followed Moses wrote the history of their own times in thirteen
books. <span id="fr_677"></span>[678](#fn_677) The other four books
contain hymns to God, and precepts for the regulation of the life of
men.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p89"></span>4. From the time of Artaxerxes to our
own day all the events have been recorded, but the accounts are not
worthy of the same confidence that we repose in those which preceded
them, because there has not been during this time an exact succession of
prophets. <span id="fr_678"></span>[679](#fn_678)

<span id="iii.viii.x-p91"></span>5. How much we are attached to our own
writings is shown plainly by our treatment of them. For although so
great a period has already passed by, no one has ventured either to add
to or to take from them, but it is inbred in all Jews from their very
birth to regard them as the teachings of God, and to abide by them, and,
if necessary, cheerfully to die for them.”

<span id="iii.viii.x-p92"></span>These remarks of the historian I have
thought might advantageously be introduced in this connection.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p93"></span>6. Another work of no little merit has
been produced by the same writer, On the Supremacy of Reason, <span
id="fr_679"></span>[680](#fn_679) which some have called
Maccabaicum, <span id="fr_680"></span>[681](#fn_680) because it contains
an account of the struggles of those Hebrews who contended manfully for
the true religion, as is related in the books called Maccabees.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p96"></span>7. And at the end of the twentieth book
of his Antiquities <span id="fr_681"></span>[682](#fn_681) Josephus
himself intimates that he had purposed to write a work in four books
concerning God and his existence, according to the traditional opinions
of the Jews, and also concerning the laws, why it is that they permit
some things while prohibiting others. <span
id="fr_682"></span>[683](#fn_682) And the same writer also mentions in
his own works other books written by himself. <span
id="fr_683"></span>[684](#fn_683)

<span id="iii.viii.x-p100"></span>8. In addition to these things it is
proper to quote also the words that are found at the close of his
Antiquities, <span id="fr_684"></span>[685](#fn_684) in confirmation of
the testimony which we have drawn from his accounts. In that place he
attacks Justus of Tiberias, <span id="fr_685"></span>[686](#fn_685) who,
like himself, had attempted to write a history of contemporary events,
on the ground that he had not written truthfully. Having brought many
<span id="page_146">p. 146</span> <span
id="iii.viii.x-Page_146"></span>other accusations against the man, he
continues in these words: <span id="fr_686"></span>[687](#fn_686)

<span id="iii.viii.x-p104"></span>9. “I indeed was not afraid in respect
to my writings as you were, <span id="fr_687"></span>[688](#fn_687) but,
on the contrary, I presented my books to the emperors themselves when
the events were almost under men’s eyes. For I was conscious that I had
preserved the truth in my account, and hence was not disappointed in my
expectation of obtaining their attestation.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p106"></span>10. And I presented my history also to
many others, some of whom were present at the war, as, for instance,
King Agrippa <span id="fr_688"></span>[689](#fn_688) and some of his
relatives.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p108"></span>11. For the Emperor Titus desired so
much that the knowledge of the events should be communicated to men by
my history alone, that he indorsed the books with his own hand and
commanded that they should be published. And King Agrippa wrote
sixty-two epistles testifying to the truthfulness of my account.” Of
these epistles Josephus subjoins two. <span
id="fr_689"></span>[690](#fn_689) But this will suffice in regard to
him. Let us now proceed with our history.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_674"></span>[144:675](2010079.htm#fr_674) <span
id="iii.viii.x-p2.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.x-p3"></span> *Against Apion,* I. 8. The common
Christian tradition (since the first century, when it was stated in the
fourth book of Ezra xiv. 44<span id="iii.viii.x-p3.1"></span> sq.) is
that Ezra was the compiler of the Old Testament canon. This, however, is
a mistake, for the canon was certainly not completed before the time of
Judas Maccabæus. Josephus is the earliest writer to give us a summary of
the books of the Old Testament; and he evidently gives not merely his
own private opinion but the commonly accepted canon of his day. He does
not name the separate books, but he tells us that they were twenty-two
in number (the number of the letters of the Hebrew alphabet), and gives
us the three divisions, so that we are able to ascertain his canon in
detail. It was doubtless as follows:—

<span id="iii.viii.x-p4"></span>1–5. Books of Moses.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p5"></span>6. Joshua.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p6"></span>7. Judges and Ruth.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p7"></span>8. Samuel.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p8"></span>9. Kings.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p9"></span>10. Chronicles.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p10"></span>11. Ezra and Nehemiah.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p11"></span>12. Esther.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p12"></span>13. Isaiah.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p13"></span>14. Jeremiah and Lamentations.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p14"></span>15. Ezekiel.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p15"></span>16. Daniel.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p16"></span>17. Twelve Minor Prophets.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p17"></span>18. Job.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p18"></span>19. Psalms.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p19"></span>20. Proverbs.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p20"></span>21. Ecclesiastes.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p21"></span>22. Song of Songs.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p22"></span>The earliest detailed list of Old
Testament books is that of Melito (given by Eusebius, IV. 26), which is
as follows:—

<span id="iii.viii.x-p23"></span>Books of Moses

<span id="iii.viii.x-p24"></span>Genesis.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p25"></span>Exodus.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p26"></span>Leviticus.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p27"></span>Numbers.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p28"></span>Deuteronomy.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p29"></span>Joshua Nave.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p30"></span>Judges.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p31"></span>Ruth.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p32"></span>Four of Kings.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p33"></span>Chronicles.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p34"></span>Psalms.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p35"></span>Proverbs.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p36"></span>Ecclesiastes.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p37"></span>Song of Songs.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p38"></span>Job.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p39"></span>Isaiah.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p40"></span>Jeremiah.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p41"></span>Twelve Minor Prophets.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p42"></span>Daniel.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p43"></span>Ezekiel.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p44"></span>Ezra.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p45"></span>Melito says nothing of the number
twenty-two, and, in fact, his list, as he gives it, numbers only
twenty-one. His list really differs from Josephus’ only in omitting the
Book of Esther. This omission may be accidental, though it is omitted by
Athanasius and Gregory Nazianzen. He makes no mention of Nehemiah, but
that is doubtless included with Ezra, as in the case of Josephus’ canon.
His canon purports to be the Palestinian one, and hence we should expect
it to be the same as that of Josephus, which makes it more probable that
the omission of Esther was only accidental. Origen (in Eusebius, VI. 25)
tells us that there were twenty-two books in the Hebrew canon; but his
list differs somewhat from that of Josephus. It is as follows:—

<span id="iii.viii.x-p46"></span>1–5. Books of Moses.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p47"></span>6. Joshua.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p48"></span>7. Judges and Ruth.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p49"></span>8. Samuel.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p50"></span>9. Kings.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p51"></span>10. Chronicles.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p52"></span>11. Ezra I. and II.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p53"></span>12. Psalms.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p54"></span>13. Proverbs.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p55"></span>14. Ecclesiastes.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p56"></span>15. Song of Songs.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p57"></span>16. \[Twelve Minor Prophets
(Rufinus).\]

<span id="iii.viii.x-p58"></span>17. Isaiah.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p59"></span>18. Jeremiah, Lamentations, and
Epistle.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p60"></span>19. Daniel.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p61"></span>20. Ezekiel.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p62"></span>21. Job.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p63"></span>22. Esther.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p64"></span>“Besides these also the Maccabees.”

<span id="iii.viii.x-p65"></span>The peculiar thing about the list is
the omission of the Twelve Minor Prophets and the insertion of the
Epistle of Jeremiah. The former were certainly looked upon by Origen as
sacred books, for he wrote a commentary upon them (according to
Eusebius, VI. 36). There is no conceivable reason for their omission,
and indeed they are needed to make up the number twenty-two. We must
conclude that the omission was simply an oversight on the part of
Eusebius or of some transcriber. Rufinus gives them as number sixteen,
as shown in the list, but the position there assigned to them is not the
ordinary one. We should expect to find them in connection with the other
prophets; but the various lists are by no means uniform in the order of
the books. On the other hand, the Greek Epistle of Jeremiah (Baruch
vi.<span id="iii.viii.x-p65.1"></span>) did not stand in the Hebrew
canon, and can have been included by Origen here only because he had
been used to seeing it in connection with Jeremiah in his copy of the
LXX. (for in ancient <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.viii.x-p65.2"></span>mss.</span> of the LXX., which probably
represent the original arrangement, it is given not as a part of Baruch,
but as an appendix to Lamentations), and hence mentioned it in this book
without thinking of its absence from the Hebrew canon. Origen adds the
Maccabees to his list, but expressly excludes them from the twenty-two
books (see Bk. VI. chap. 25, note 5). Meanwhile the Talmud and the
Midrash divide the canon into twenty-four books, and this was probably
the original Jewish division. The number twenty-two was gained by adding
Ruth to Judges and Lamentations to Jeremiah. The number thus obtained
agreed with the number of letters in the alphabet, and was therefore
accepted as the number sanctioned by divine authority, and the division
was commonly adopted by the early Fathers. This is Strack’s view, and
seems better than the opposite opinion, which is advocated by many, that
the number twenty-two was the original. It is easier to see how
twenty-four might be changed to twenty-two than how the reverse should
happen. So, for instance, Jerome in his preface to the translation of
Samuel and Kings, makes the number twenty-two, and gives a list which
agrees with the canon of Josephus except in the three general divisions,
which are differently composed. It will be seen that these various lists
(with the exception of that of Origen, which includes the Epistle of
Jeremiah and appends the Maccabees) include only the books of our canon.
But the LXX. prints with the Old Testament a number of Books which we
call Apocrypha and exclude from the canon. It has been commonly
supposed, therefore, that there was a regular Alexandrian canon
differing from the Palestinian. But this is not likely. An examination
of Philo’s use of the Old Testament shows us that his canon agreed with
that of Josephus, comprising no apocryphal books. It is probable in fact
that the LXX. included in their translation these other books which were
held in high esteem, without intending to deliver any utterance as to
the extent of the canon or to alter the common Jewish canon by declaring
these a part of it. But however that was, the use of the LXX., which was
much wider than that of the Hebrew, brought these books into general
use, and thus we see them gradually acquiring canonical authority and
used as a part of the canon by Augustine and later Fathers. Jerome was
the only one in the West to utter a protest against such use of them.
Both Athanasius and Cyril of Jerusalem added to the canon Baruch and the
Epistle of Jeremiah; but opinion in the Orient was mostly against making
any books not in the Hebrew canon of canonical authority, and from the
fourth century the Eastern Fathers used them less and less. They were,
however, officially recognized as a part of the canon by numerous
medieval and modern synods until 1839, when the larger Catechism of the
Orthodox Catholic Eastern Church, the most authoritative standard of the
Græco-Russian Church, expressly excluded them. The Latin Church,
meanwhile, has always regarded the Apocrypha as canonical, and by its
action at the Council of Trent has made them a part of the official
canon. See Strack’s article in Herzog, translated in Schaff-Herzog; also
Harman’s *Introduction to the Holy Scripture,* p. 33 sqq. The subject is
discussed in all Old Testament introductions.

<span id="fn_675"></span>[145:676](2010079.htm#fr_675) <span
id="iii.viii.x-p66.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.x-p67"></span> Literally, “the tradition respecting
the origin of man (<span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.viii.x-p67.1"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.viii.x-p67.2"></span>νθρωπογονίας</span>) down to his own
death.” I have felt it necessary to insert the words, “and continue the
history,” which are not found in the Greek, but which are implied in the
words, “down to his own death.”

<span id="fn_676"></span>[145:677](2010079.htm#fr_676) <span
id="iii.viii.x-p67.3"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.x-p68"></span> Among the Jews in the time of Christ a
world’s era was in use, dating from the creation of the world; and it is
this era which Josephus employs here and throughout his *Antiquities.*
His figures are often quite inconsistent,—probably owing, in large part,
to the corrupt state of the existing text,—and the confusion which
results is considerable. See Destinon’s *Chronologie des Josephus.*

<span id="fn_677"></span>[145:678](2010079.htm#fr_677) <span
id="iii.viii.x-p69.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.x-p70"></span> These thirteen books were:—

<span id="iii.viii.x-p71"></span>1. Joshua.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p72"></span>2. Judges and Ruth.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p73"></span>3. Samuel.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p74"></span>4. Kings.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p75"></span>5. Chronicles.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p76"></span>6. Ezra and Nehemiah.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p77"></span>7. Esther.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p78"></span>8. Isaiah.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p79"></span>9. Jeremiah and Lamentations.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p80"></span>10. Ezekiel.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p81"></span>11. Daniel.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p82"></span>12. Twelve Minor Prophets.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p83"></span>13. Job.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p84"></span>As will be seen, Josephus divided the
canon into three parts: first, the Law (five books of Moses); second,
the Prophets (the thirteen just mentioned); third, the Hagiographa
(Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Canticles). The division of the
canon into three such parts is older than Josephus; at the same time,
his division is quite different from any other division known. Jerome’s
is as follows:—

<span id="iii.viii.x-p85"></span>1. Law: five books of Moses.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p86"></span>2. Prophets: Joshua, Judges and Ruth,
Samuel, Kings, Isaiah, Jeremiah and Lamentations, Ezekiel, Twelve Minor
Prophets (eight books).

<span id="iii.viii.x-p87"></span>3. Hagiographa (Holy writings): Job,
Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Canticles, Daniel, Chronicles, Ezra,
Esther (nine books).

<span id="iii.viii.x-p88"></span>The division which exists in our Hebrew
Bibles differs from this of Jerome’s only in transferring Ruth and
Lamentations to the third division, and thus making twenty-four books.
This is held by many to be a later form, as remarked above, but as
Strack shows, it is rather the original. In the LXX., which is followed
in our English Bible, the books are arranged, without reference to the
three divisions, solely according to their subject-matter. The peculiar
division of Josephus was caused by his looking at the matter from the
historical standpoint, which led him to include in the second division
all the books which contained, as he says, an account of events from
Moses to Artaxerxes.

<span id="fn_678"></span>[145:679](2010079.htm#fr_678) <span
id="iii.viii.x-p89.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.x-p90"></span> The Artaxerxes here referred to is
Artaxerxes Longimanus who reigned <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.viii.x-p90.1"></span>b.c.</span> 464 to 425. It was under him
that Ezra and Nehemiah carried on their work and that the later prophets
flourished. Malachi—the last of them—uttered his prophecies at the end
of Artaxerxes’ or at the beginning of Darius’ reign. It was commonly
held among the Jews that with Haggai, Zachariah and Malachi the
prophetical spirit had departed from Israel, and the line was sharply
drawn, as here by Josephus, between them and the writers of the
Apocrypha who followed them.

<span id="fn_679"></span>[145:680](2010079.htm#fr_679) <span
id="iii.viii.x-p93.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.x-p94"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.viii.x-p94.1"></span>εἰς Μακκαβαίους λόγος ἣ περὶ αὐτοκρ€τορος
λογισμοῦ</span>: *De Maccabæis, seu de rationis imperio liber.* This
book is often called the Fourth Book of Maccabees, and was formerly
ascribed to Josephus. As a consequence it is printed with his works in
many editions. But it is now universally acknowledged to be spurious,
although who the author is we cannot tell.

<span id="fn_680"></span>[145:681](2010079.htm#fr_680) <span
id="iii.viii.x-p94.2"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.x-p95"></span> <span class="Greek"><span

chapter, note 7.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p98"></span> See the same note.

<span id="fn_684"></span>[145:685](2010079.htm#fr_684) <span
id="iii.viii.x-p100.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.x-p101"></span> The passage referred to, which is
quoted just below, is found in his *Life,* §65, and not in the
*Antiquities.* But we can see from the last paragraph of the
*Antiquities* that he wrote his *Life* really as an appendix to that
work, and undoubtedly as Ewald suggests, issued it with a second edition
of the *Antiquities* about twenty years after the first. In the <span
class="c13"><span id="iii.viii.x-p101.1"></span>mss.</span> it is always
found with the *Antiquities,* and hence the whole might with justice be
viewed as one work. It will be noticed that Eusebius mentions no
separate Life of Josephus, which shows that he regarded it simply as a
part of the *Antiquities.*

<span id="fn_685"></span>[145:686](2010079.htm#fr_685) <span
id="iii.viii.x-p101.2"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.x-p102"></span> Justus of Tiberias was the leader of
one of the factions of that city during the troublous times before the
outbreak of the war, while Josephus was governor of Galilee, and as an
opponent he caused him considerable trouble. He is mentioned frequently
in Josephus’ *Life,* and we are thus enabled to gather a tolerably
complete idea of him—though of course the account is that of an enemy.
He wrote a work upon the Jews which was devoted chiefly to the affairs
of the Jewish war and in which he attacked Josephus very severely. This
work, which is no longer extant, was read by Photius and is described by
him in his *Bibl. Cod.* 33, under the title, <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.viii.x-p102.1"></span>βασιλεῖς ᾽Ιουδαῖοι οἱ ἐν τοῖς
στέμμασι</span>. It was in consequence of this work that Josephus felt
obliged to publish his *Life,* which is really little more than a
defense of himself over against the attacks of Justus. See above, note
1.

<span id="fn_686"></span>[146:687](2010079.htm#fr_686) <span
id="iii.viii.x-p102.2"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.x-p103"></span> *Vita,*§65.

<span id="fn_687"></span>[146:688](2010079.htm#fr_687) <span
id="iii.viii.x-p104.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.x-p105"></span> Josephus has just affirmed in a
previous paragraph that Justus had had his *History* written for twenty
years, and yet had not published it until after the death of Vespasian,
Titus, and Agrippa, and he accuses him of waiting until after their
death because he was afraid that they would contradict his statements.
Josephus then goes on to say in the passage quoted that he was not, like
Justus, afraid to publish his work during the lifetime of the chief
actors in the war.

<span id="fn_688"></span>[146:689](2010079.htm#fr_688) <span
id="iii.viii.x-p106.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.x-p107"></span> Agrippa II. See above, Bk. II. chap.
19, note 3. Agrippa sided with the Romans in the war and was with
Vespasian and Titus in their camp much of the time, and in Galilee made
repeated efforts to induce the people to give up their rebellion, that
the war might be avoided.

<span id="fn_689"></span>[146:690](2010079.htm#fr_689) <span
id="iii.viii.x-p108.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.x-p109"></span> These two epistles are still extant,
and are given by Josephus in his *Vita,* immediately after the passage
just quoted by Eusebius. The first of them reads as follows (according
to Whiston’s translation): “King Agrippa to Josephus, his dear friend,
sendeth greeting. I have read over thy book with great pleasure, and it
appears to me that thou hast done it much more accurately and with
greater care than have the other writers. Send me the rest of these
books. Farewell, my dear friend.”
