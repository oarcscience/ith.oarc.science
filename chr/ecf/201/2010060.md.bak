<span id="iii.vii.xix-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.vii.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.—</span>*The Works of
Philo* <span id="fr_419"></span>[420](#fn_419.md) *that have come down to
us.*

<span id="iii.vii.xix-p3"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.vii.xix-p3.1"></span>Copious</span> in language, comprehensive
in thought, sublime and elevated in his views of divine Scripture, Philo
has produced manifold and various expositions of the sacred books. On
the one hand, he expounds in order the events recorded in Genesis in the
books to which he gives the title *Allegories of the Sacred Laws*; <span
id="fr_420"></span>[421](#fn_420.md) on the other hand, he makes successive
divisions of the chapters in the Scriptures which are the subject of
investigation, and gives objections and solutions, in the books which he
quite suitably calls *Questions and Answers on Genesis and
Exodus*. <span id="fr_421"></span>[422](#fn_421.md)

<span id="iii.vii.xix-p6"></span>2. There are, besides these, treatises
expressly worked out by him on certain subjects, such as the two books
*On Agriculture*, <span id="fr_422"></span>[423](#fn_422.md) and the same
number *On Drunken*<span id="page_120">p. 120</span> <span
id="iii.vii.xix-Page_120"></span>*ness*; <span
id="fr_423"></span>[424](#fn_423.md) and some others distinguished by
different titles corresponding to the contents of each; for instance,
*Concerning the things which the Sober Mind desires and
execrates,* <span id="fr_424"></span>[425](#fn_424.md) *On the Confusion of
Tongues,* <span id="fr_425"></span>[426](#fn_425.md) *On Flight and
Discovery,* <span id="fr_426"></span>[427](#fn_426.md) *On Assembly for the
sake of Instruction,* <span id="fr_427"></span>[428](#fn_427.md) *On the
question, ‘Who is heir to things divine?’* or *On the division of things
into equal and unequal,* <span id="fr_428"></span>[429](#fn_428.md) and
still further the work *On the three Virtues which with others have been
described by Moses.* <span id="fr_429"></span>[430](#fn_429.md)

<span id="iii.vii.xix-p16"></span>3. In addition to these is the work
*On those whose Names have been changed and why they have been
changed,* <span id="fr_430"></span>[431](#fn_430.md) in which he says that
he had written also two books *On Covenants.* <span
id="fr_431"></span>[432](#fn_431.md)

<span id="iii.vii.xix-p20"></span>4. And there is also a work of his *On
Emigration,* <span id="fr_432"></span>[433](#fn_432.md) and one *On the
life of a Wise Man made perfect in Righteousness,* or *On unwritten
Laws;* <span id="fr_433"></span>[434](#fn_433.md) and still further the
work *On Giants* or *On the Immutability of God,* <span
id="fr_434"></span>[435](#fn_434.md) and a first, second, third, fourth and
fifth book *On the proposition, that Dreams according to Moses are sent
by God.* <span id="fr_435"></span>[436](#fn_435.md) These are the books on
Genesis that have come down to us.

<span id="iii.vii.xix-p25"></span>5. But on Exodus we are acquainted
with the first, second, third, fourth and fifth books of *Questions and
Answers;* <span id="fr_436"></span>[437](#fn_436.md) also with that *On the
Tabernacle,* <span id="fr_437"></span>[438](#fn_437.md) and that *On the
Ten Commandments,* <span id="fr_438"></span>[439](#fn_438.md) and the four
books <span id="page_121">p. 121</span> <span
id="iii.vii.xix-Page_121"></span>*On the laws which refer especially to
the principal divisions of the ten Commandments,* <span
id="fr_439"></span>[440](#fn_439.md) and another *On animals intended for
sacrifice* and *On the kinds of sacrifice,* <span
id="fr_440"></span>[441](#fn_440.md) and another *On the rewards fixed in
the law for the good, and on the punishments and curses fixed for the
wicked.* <span id="fr_441"></span>[442](#fn_441.md)

<span id="iii.vii.xix-p32"></span>6. In addition to all these there are
extant also some single-volumed works of his; as for instance, the work
*On Providence,* <span id="fr_442"></span>[443](#fn_442.md) and the book
composed by him *On the Jews,* <span id="fr_443"></span>[444](#fn_443.md)
and *The Statesman;* <span id="fr_444"></span>[445](#fn_444.md) and still
further, *Alexander,* or *On the possession of reason by the irrational
animals.* <span id="fr_445"></span>[446](#fn_445.md) Besides these there is
a work *On the proposition that every wicked man is a slave,* to which
is subjoined the work *On the proposition that every goad man is
free.* <span id="fr_446"></span>[447](#fn_446.md)

<span id="iii.vii.xix-p38"></span>7. After these was composed by him the
work *On the contemplative life,* or *On suppliants,* <span
id="fr_447"></span>[448](#fn_447.md) from which we have drawn the facts
concerning the life of the apostolic men; and still further, the
*Interpretation of the Hebrew names in the law and in the prophets* are
said to be the result of his industry. <span
id="fr_448"></span>[449](#fn_448.md)

<span id="iii.vii.xix-p41"></span>8. And he is said to have read in the
presence of the whole Roman Senate during the reign of Claudius <span
id="fr_449"></span>[450](#fn_449.md) the work which he had written, when he
came to Rome under Caius, concerning Caius’ hatred of the gods, and to
which, with ironical reference to its character, he had given the title
*On the Virtues.* <span id="fr_450"></span>[451](#fn_450.md) And his
discourses were so much admired as to be deemed worthy of a place in the
libraries.

<span id="iii.vii.xix-p44"></span>9. At this time, while Paul was
completing his journey “from Jerusalem and round about unto
Illyricum,” <span id="fr_451"></span>[452](#fn_451.md) Claudius drove the
Jews out of Rome; and Aquila and Priscilla, leaving Rome with the other
Jews, came to Asia, and there abode with the apostle Paul, who was
confirming the churches of that region whose <span id="page_122">p.
122</span> <span id="iii.vii.xix-Page_122"></span>foundations he had
newly laid. The sacred book of the Acts informs us also of these
things. <span id="fr_452"></span>[453](#fn_452.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_419"></span>[119:420](2010060.htm#fr_419.md) <span
id="iii.vii.xix-p1.2"></span>

<span id="iii.vii.xix-p2"></span> On Philo’s works, see Schürer, *Gesch.
des jüd. Volkes,* II. p. 831 sqq. The best (though it leaves much to be
desired) complete edition of Philo’s works is that of Mangey: 2 vols.,
folio, London, 1742; English translation of Philo’s works by Yonge, 4
vols., London, 1854–55. Upon Philo’s life, see chaps. 4–6, above.
Eusebius, in his *Præp. Evang.,* quotes extensively from Philo’s works
and preserves some fragments of which we should otherwise be ignorant.

<span id="fn_420"></span>[119:421](2010060.htm#fr_420.md) <span
id="iii.vii.xix-p3.2"></span>

<span id="iii.vii.xix-p4"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vii.xix-p4.1"></span>νόμων ἱερῶν ἀλληγορίαι</span>. This work is
still extant, and, according to Schürer, includes all the works
contained in the first volume of Mangey’s edition (except the *De
Opificio Mundi,* upon which see Schürer, p. 846 sqq. and note 11,
below), comprising 16 different titles. The work forms the second great
group of writings upon the Pentateuch, and is a very full and
allegorical commentary upon Genesis, beginning with the second chapter
and following it verse by verse through the fourth chapter; but from
that point on certain passages are selected and treated at length under
special titles, and under those titles, in Schürer’s opinion, were
published by Philo as separate works, though really forming a part of
one complete whole. From this much confusion has resulted. Eusebius
embraces all of the works as far as the end of chap. 4 (including five
titles in Mangey) under the one general title, but from that point on he
too quotes separate works under special titles, but at the end (§5,
below) he unites them all as the “extant works on Genesis.” Many
portions of the commentary are now missing. Compare Schürer, *ibid*. pp.
838–846.

<span id="fn_421"></span>[119:422](2010060.htm#fr_421.md) <span
id="iii.vii.xix-p4.2"></span>

<span id="iii.vii.xix-p5"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vii.xix-p5.1"></span>ζητήματα καὶ λύσεις</span>: *Quaestiones et
solutiones.* According to Schürer (*ibid.* p. 836 sq.), a comparatively
brief catechetical interpretation of the Pentateuch in the form of
questions and answers, embracing probably six books on Genesis and five
on Exodus, and forming the first great group of writings upon the
Pentateuch. So far as Eusebius seems to have known, they covered only
Genesis and Exodus, and this is all that we are sure of, though some
think that they included also the remainder of the Pentateuch. About
half of his work (four books on Genesis and two on Exodus) is extant in
an Armenian version (published by Aucher in 2 vols., Venet. 1822 and
’26, and in Latin by Ritter, vols. 6 and 7 of his edition of Philo’s
works); and numerous Latin and Greek fragments still exist (see Schürer,
p. 837 sqq.).

<span id="fn_422"></span>[119:423](2010060.htm#fr_422.md) <span

<span id="iii.vii.xix-p7"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vii.xix-p7.1"></span>περὶ γεωργίας δύο</span>: *De Agricultura
duo* (so Jerome, *de vir. ill.* 11). Upon [Genesis ix.
20](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#020.md)<span id="iii.vii.xix-p7.2"></span>,
forming a part (as do all the works mentioned in §§2–4 except *On the
Three Virtues,* and *On the Unwritten Laws,* which belong to the third
group of writings on the Pentateuch) of the large commentary, <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.vii.xix-p7.3"></span>νόμων ἱερῶν
ἀλληγορίαι</span>, mentioned above (note 2). This work is still extant,
and is given by Mangey, I. 300–356, as two works with distinct titles:
<span class="Greek"><span id="iii.vii.xix-p7.4"></span>περὶ
γεωργίας</span> and <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vii.xix-p7.5"></span>περὶ φυτουργίας Νῶε τὸ δεύτερον</span>
(Schürer, p. 843).

<span id="fn_423"></span>[120:424](2010060.htm#fr_423.md) <span
id="iii.vii.xix-p7.6"></span>

<span id="iii.vii.xix-p8"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vii.xix-p8.1"></span>περὶ μέθης τοσαῦτα</span>: *De ebrietate
duo* (so Jerome, *ibid.*). Upon <span id="iii.vii.xix-p8.2"></span>[Gen.
ix. 21](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#021.md)<span
id="iii.vii.xix-p8.3"></span>. Only the second book is extant (Mangey,
I. 357–391), but from its beginning it is plain that another book
originally preceded it (Schürer, p. 843).

<span id="fn_424"></span>[120:425](2010060.htm#fr_424.md) <span
id="iii.vii.xix-p8.4"></span>

<span id="iii.vii.xix-p9"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vii.xix-p9.1"></span>περὶ ὧν νήψας ὁ νοῦς εὔχεται καὶ
καταρᾶται</span>. Jerome, *de vir. ill.* 11, *de his quæ sensu precamur
et detestamur.* Upon [Gen. ix. 24](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#024.md)<span
id="iii.vii.xix-p9.2"></span>. Still extant, and given by Mangey (I.
392–403), who, however, prints the work under the title <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.vii.xix-p9.3"></span>περὶ τοῦ ἐξένηψε
Νῶε</span>: *De Sobrietate;* though in two of the best <span
class="c13"><span id="iii.vii.xix-p9.4"></span>mss.</span> (according to
Mangey, I. 392, note) the title agrees closely with that given by
Eusebius (Schürer, p. 843).

<span id="fn_425"></span>[120:426](2010060.htm#fr_425.md) <span
id="iii.vii.xix-p9.5"></span>

<span id="iii.vii.xix-p10"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vii.xix-p10.1"></span>περὶ συγκύσεως τῶν διαλέκτων</span>. Upon
<span id="iii.vii.xix-p10.2"></span>[Gen. xi.
1-9](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#001.md)<span
id="iii.vii.xix-p10.3"></span>. Still extant, and given by Mangey, I.
404–435 (Schürer, p. 844).

<span id="fn_426"></span>[120:427](2010060.htm#fr_426.md) <span
id="iii.vii.xix-p10.4"></span>

<span id="iii.vii.xix-p11"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vii.xix-p11.1"></span>περὶ φυγῆς καὶ εὑρέσεως</span>. The same
title is found in Johannes Monachus (Mangey, I. 546, note), and it is
probably correct, as the work treats of the flight and the discovery of
Hagar (<span id="iii.vii.xix-p11.2"></span>[Gen. xvi.
6-14](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#006.md)<span
id="iii.vii.xix-p11.3"></span>). It is still extant and is given by
Mangey (I. 546–577) under the title <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vii.xix-p11.4"></span>περὶ φυγ€δων</span>, ‘On Fugitives.’ The
text of Eusebius in this place has been very much corrupted. The reading
which I give is supported by good <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.vii.xix-p11.5"></span>ms.</span> authority, and is adopted by
Valesius, Stroth, and Laemmer. But Nicephorus reads <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.vii.xix-p11.6"></span>περὶ φυγῆς καὶ
αἱρέσεως καὶ ὁ περὶ φύσεως καὶ εὑρέσεως</span>, which is also supported
by <span class="c13"><span id="iii.vii.xix-p11.7"></span>ms.</span>
authority, and is adopted by Burton, Schwegler, and Heinichen. But upon
comparing the title of the work, as given by Johannes Monachus and as
found in the various <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.vii.xix-p11.8"></span>mss.</span> of Philo, with the contents of
the work itself, there can be little doubt of the correctness of the
shorter reading. Of the second work, which the longer reading introduces
into the text of Eusebius, we have no knowledge, and Philo can hardly
have written it. Schürer, who adopts the shorter reading, expresses
himself very strongly (p. 845, note 34).

<span id="fn_427"></span>[120:428](2010060.htm#fr_427.md) <span
id="iii.vii.xix-p11.9"></span>

<span id="iii.vii.xix-p12"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vii.xix-p12.1"></span>περὶ τῆς πρὸς τὰ παιδεύματα
συνόδου</span>, “On Assembly for the sake of instruction.” Upon <span
id="iii.vii.xix-p12.2"></span>[Gen. xvi.
1-6](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#001.md)<span
id="iii.vii.xix-p12.3"></span>, which is interpreted to mean that one
must make himself acquainted with the lower branches of knowledge
(Hagar) before he can go on to the higher (Sarah), and from them obtain
the fruit, viz.: virtue (Isaac). Still extant, and given by Mangey, I.
519–545 (Schürer, 844 sqq.).

<span id="fn_428"></span>[120:429](2010060.htm#fr_428.md) <span
id="iii.vii.xix-p12.4"></span>

<span id="iii.vii.xix-p13"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vii.xix-p13.1"></span>περὶ τε τοῦ, τίς ὁ τῶν θείων ἐστὶ
κληρονόμος, ἢ περὶ τῆς εἰς τὰ ἴσα καὶ ἐναντία τομῆς</span>. From this
double title Jerome (*de vir. ill.* 11) wrongly makes two works. The
writing is still extant, and is given by Mangey (I. 473–518) under the
title <span class="Greek"><span id="iii.vii.xix-p13.2"></span>περὶ τοῦ
τίς ὁ τῶν θείων πραγμ€των κληρονόμος</span> (Schürer, 844).

<span id="fn_429"></span>[120:430](2010060.htm#fr_429.md) <span
id="iii.vii.xix-p13.3"></span>

<span id="iii.vii.xix-p14"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vii.xix-p14.1"></span>περὶ τῶν τριῶν ἀρετῶν, ἃς σὺν ἄλλαις
ἀνέγραψε Μωυσῆς</span>. This work is still extant, and is given by
Mangey under the title <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vii.xix-p14.2"></span>περὶ τριῶν ἀρετῶν ἤτοι περὶ ἀνδρείας καὶ
φιλανθρωπίας καὶ μετανοίας: περὶ ἀνδρείας</span>, II. 375–383; <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.vii.xix-p14.3"></span>περὶ
φιλανθρωπίας</span>, II. 383–405; <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vii.xix-p14.4"></span>περὶ μετανοίας</span>, II. 405–407. Jerome
gives the simple title *De tribus virtutibus liber unus.*

<span id="iii.vii.xix-p15"></span>According to Schürer (p. 852 sqq.) it
forms an appendix to the third great group of works upon the Pentateuch,
containing those laws which do not belong to any one of the ten
commandments in particular, but fall under the head of general cardinal
virtues. The third group, as Schürer describes it (p. 846), aims to give
for non-Jews a complete view of the Mosaic legislation, and embraces,
first, the work upon the Creation (which in the <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.vii.xix-p15.1"></span>mss.</span> and editions of Philo is
wrongly placed at the beginning in connection with the great
*Allegorical Commentary,* and is thus included in that by Eusebius in
his list of Philo’s works, so that he does not make special mention of
it); second, the lives of great and good men, the *living unwritten
law;* and third, the Mosaic legislation proper (1. The ten commandments;
2. The special laws connected with each of these); and finally an
appendix treating of certain cardinal virtues, and of reward and
punishments. This group is more historic and less allegoric than the two
others, which are rather esoteric and scientific.

<span id="fn_430"></span>[120:431](2010060.htm#fr_430.md) <span
id="iii.vii.xix-p16.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vii.xix-p17"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vii.xix-p17.1"></span>περὶ τῶν μετονομαζομένων καὶ ὧν ἓνεκα
μετονομ€ζονται</span>, *De Mutatione nominum.* Upon <span
id="iii.vii.xix-p17.2"></span>[Gen. xvii.
1-22](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#001.md)<span
id="iii.vii.xix-p17.3"></span>. This work is still extant, and is given
by Mangey, I. 578–619. See Schürer, p. 485.

<span id="fn_431"></span>[120:432](2010060.htm#fr_431.md) <span
id="iii.vii.xix-p17.4"></span>

<span id="iii.vii.xix-p18"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vii.xix-p18.1"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vii.xix-p18.2"></span>ν ᾧ φησι συντεταχέναι καὶ περι διαθηκῶν
πρῶτον καὶ δεύτερον</span>. Nearly all the <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.vii.xix-p18.3"></span>mss.</span>, followed by some of the
editors, read <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vii.xix-p18.4"></span>πρώτης καὶ δευτέρας</span>, instead of
<span class="Greek"><span id="iii.vii.xix-p18.5"></span>πρῶτον καὶ
δεύτερον</span>, thus making Eusebius mention a work “On the first and
second covenants,” instead of a first and second book “On the
covenants.” It is plain from Philo’s own reference to the work (on p.
586 in Mangey’s ed.) that he wrote two books “On covenants,” and not a
work “On the two covenants.” I have therefore felt warranted in reading
with Heinichen and some other editors <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vii.xix-p18.6"></span>πρῶτον καὶ δεύτερον</span>, a reading
which is more natural in view of the absence of an article with <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.vii.xix-p18.7"></span>διαθηκῶν</span>, and
which is confirmed by Nicephorus Callistus. This reading must be correct
unless we are to suppose that Eusebius misread Philo. Fabricius suggests
that Eusebius probably wrote <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vii.xix-p18.8"></span>ὰ</span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vii.xix-p18.9"></span>καὶ β'</span>, which the copyists wrongly
referred to the “covenants” instead of to the number of the books, and
hence gave the feminine instead of the neuter form.

<span id="iii.vii.xix-p19"></span>This work “On covenants,” or “On the
whole discussion concerning covenants” (as Philo gives it), is now lost,
as it was already in the time of Eusebius; at least he knew of it only
from Philo’s reference to it. See Schürer, p. 845.

<span id="fn_432"></span>[120:433](2010060.htm#fr_432.md) <span

class="Greek"><span id="iii.vii.xix-p22.2"></span>δικαιοσύνην</span>
here is a mistake for <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vii.xix-p22.3"></span>διδασκαλίαν</span>, which is the true
reading in the original title.) This work, which is still extant, is
given by Mangey, II. 1–40, under the same title (<span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.vii.xix-p22.4"></span>διδασκαλίαν</span>,
however, instead of <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vii.xix-p22.5"></span>δικαιοσύνην</span>), with the addition,
<span class="Greek"><span id="iii.vii.xix-p22.6"></span>ὁ</span> <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.vii.xix-p22.7"></span>ἐστὶ περὶ
᾽Αβρα€μ</span>: *De Abrahamo.* It opens the second division of the third
great group of writings on the Pentateuch (see note 11, above): the
biographical division, mentioning Enos, Enoch and Noah, Abraham, Isaac
and Jacob, but dealing chiefly with Abraham. The biographies of Isaac
and Jacob probably followed, but they are lost, and we have no trace of
them, so that the life of Joseph (see below, note 26) in the <span
class="c13"><span id="iii.vii.xix-p22.8"></span>mss.</span> follows

[11](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#011.md)<span
id="iii.vii.xix-p23.2"></span>. The two parts of this work, both of
which are still extant, form really but one book; for instance, Johannes
Monachus (*ineditus*) quotes from the latter part under the title <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.vii.xix-p23.3"></span>περὶ γιγ€ντων</span>
(according to Mangey, I. 262, note, and 272, note). But the two are
divided in Mangey’s edition, where the first is given under the title
<span class="Greek"><span id="iii.vii.xix-p23.4"></span>περὶ
γιγ€ντων</span> (I. 262–272), the second under the title <span

class="Greek"><span id="iii.vii.xix-p23.6"></span>τι ἄτρεπτον</span> (I.

the beginning of this note in all the <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.vii.xix-p23.7"></span>mss.</span> of Eusebius except two, which
have <span class="Greek"><span id="iii.vii.xix-p23.8"></span>καὶ</span>
instead of ἤ, thus making two separate works. This reading is adopted by
Heinichen and by Closs, but is poorly supported by <span
class="c13"><span id="iii.vii.xix-p23.9"></span>ms.</span> authority,
and since the two titles cover only one work, as already mentioned, the
ἤ is more natural than the <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vii.xix-p23.10"></span>καὶ</span>.

id="iii.vii.xix-p24.4"></span> sqq. (given by Mangey, I. 620–658), the

id="iii.vii.xix-p24.6"></span> and xl.–xli. (given by Mangey, I.
659–699). Jerome (*de vir. ill.* 11) follows Eusebius in mentioning five
books, and there is no occasion to doubt the report. Schürer thinks that
the two extant books are the second and third of the original five
(Schürer, 845 sqq.).

<span id="iii.vii.xix-p26"></span> <span class="Greek"><span

reason to think there were any more.

<span id="iii.vii.xix-p27"></span> Philo wrote a work entitled <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.vii.xix-p27.1"></span>περὶ βίου
Μωσέως</span>: *Vita Mosis,* which is still extant, but is not mentioned
in the catalogue of Eusebius. It contains a long description of the
tabernacle, and consequently Schürer concludes that the work mentioned
here by Eusebius (<span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vii.xix-p27.2"></span>περὶ τῆς σκήνης</span>) represents that
portion of the larger work. If this be the case, it is possible that the
section in the <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.vii.xix-p27.3"></span>mss.</span> used by Eusebius was detached
from the rest of the work and constituted an independent book. The
omission of the title of the larger work is doubtless due, as Schürer
remarks, to the imperfect transmission of the text of Eusebius’
catalogue. See Schürer, p. 855.

<span id="fn_438"></span>[120:439](2010060.htm#fr_438.md) <span

<span id="iii.vii.xix-p28"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vii.xix-p28.1"></span>περὶ τῶν δέκα λογίων</span>: *De
Decalogo.* Still extant, and given by Mangey, II. 180–209. Jerome has
the condensed title *de tabernaculo et decalogo libri quattuor,* and
this introduces the third division of the third general group of works
upon the Pentateuch (see note 11, above), and, according to Schürer,
should be joined directly to the <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vii.xix-p28.2"></span>βίος πολιτικός</span>, or *Life of
Joseph,* and not separated from it by the insertion of the *Life of
Moses* (as is done by Mangey), which does not belong to this group
(Schürer, p. 849 sqq.).

specialibus legibus.* A part of the third division of the third general
group of works (see note 11, above). It is still extant in four books,
each with a special title, and each containing many subdivisions. They
are given by Mangey: first book, II. 210–269, in seven parts: *de
circumcisione, de monarchia Liber I., de monarchia Liber II., de præmiis
sacerdotum, de victimis, de sacrificantibus,* or *de victimis
offerentibus, de mercede meretricis non accipienda in sacrarium;* second
book, 270–298, incomplete in Mangey, but entire in Tischendorf’s
*Philonea,* p. 1–83; third book, 299–334; fourth book, 335–374: made up
like the first of a number of tracts on special subjects. Philo, in this
work, attempts to bring all the Mosaic laws into a system under the ten
rubrics of the decalogue: for instance, under the first two
commandments, the laws in regard to priests and sacrifices; under the
fourth, the laws in regard to the Sabbath, &c. See Schürer, p. 850 sqq.

id="iii.vii.xix-p30.1"></span>περὶ τῶν εἰς τὰς ἱερουργίας ζώων, καὶ τίνα
τὰ τῶν θυσιῶν εἴδη</span>. This is really only a portion of the first
book of the work just mentioned, given in Mangey under the title *de
victimis* (II. 237–250). It is possible that these various sections of
books—or at least this one—circulated separately, and that thus Eusebius
took it for an independent work. See Schürer, p. 851.

ἀγαθοῖς ἄθλων, τοῖς δὲ πονηροῖς ἐπιτιμίων καὶ ἀρῶν</span>, still extant
and given by Mangey (incorrectly as two separate works) under the titles
<span class="Greek"><span id="iii.vii.xix-p31.2"></span>περὶ ἄθλων καὶ
ἐπιτιμίων</span>, *de præmiis et pœnis* (II. 408–428), and <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.vii.xix-p31.3"></span>περὶ ἀρῶν</span>, *de
execrationibus* (II. 429–437). The writing forms a sort of epilogue to
the work upon the Mosaic legislation. Schürer, p. 854.

<span id="iii.vii.xix-p33"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vii.xix-p33.1"></span>τὸ περὶ προνοίας</span>, *De providentia.*
This work is extant only in an Armenian version, and is published with a
Latin translation by Aucher, Vol. I. p. 1–121 (see above, note 3), and
in Latin by Ritter (Vol. VIII.). Two Greek fragments, one of
considerable extent, are preserved by Eusebius in his *Præparatio
Evang.* VII. 21, and VIII. 14. In the Armenian the work consists of two
books, but the first is of doubtful genuineness, and Eusebius seems to
have known only one, for both quotations in the *Præp. Evang.* are from
the present second book, and the work is cited in the singular, as also
in the present passage, where <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vii.xix-p33.2"></span>τὸ</span> is to be read instead of <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.vii.xix-p33.3"></span>τὰ</span>, though some
<span class="c13"><span id="iii.vii.xix-p33.4"></span>mss.</span> have
the latter. The work (which is not found in Mangey’s ed.) is one of
Philo’s separate works which does not fall under any of the three groups
upon the Pentateuch.

<span id="iii.vii.xix-p34"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vii.xix-p34.1"></span>περὶ ᾽Ιουδαίων</span>, which is doubtless
to be identified with the <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vii.xix-p34.2"></span>ἡ</span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vii.xix-p34.3"></span>ὑπὲρ ᾽Ιουδαίων ἀπολογία</span>, which is
no longer extant, but which Eusebius mentions, and from which he quotes
in his *Præp. Evang.* VIII. 2. The fragment given by Eusebius is printed
by Mangey in Vol. II. p. 632–634, and in Dähne’s opinion (*Theol.
Studien und Kritiken,* 1883, p. 990) the two preceding fragments given
by Mangey (p. 626 sqq.) also belong to this *Apology.* The work entitled
*de nobilitate* (Mangey, II. 437–444) possibly formed a part of the
*Apology.* This is Dähne’s opinion (see *ibid.* p. 990, 1037), with whom
Schürer agrees. The genuineness of the *Apology* is generally admitted,
though it has been disputed on insufficient grounds by Grätz (*Gesch.
der Juden,* III. p. 680, third ed.), who is followed by Hilgenfeld (in
the *Zeitschrift für wiss. Theologie,* 1832, p. 275 sq. and in his
*Ketzergesch. des Urchristenthums,* p. 87 sq.). This too, like the
preceding, was one of the separate works of Philo. See Schürer, p. 861
sq.

id="iii.vii.xix-p35.3"></span>βίος πολιτικὸς ὅπερ ἐστὶ περὶ
᾽Ιωσήφ</span>: *De Josepho.* Photius, *Bib. Cod.* 103, gives the title
<span class="Greek"><span id="iii.vii.xix-p35.4"></span>περὶ βίου
πολιτικοῦ</span>. This forms a part of the second division of the third
great group upon the Pentateuch (see above, note 11), and follows
directly the Life of Abraham, the Lives of Isaac and Jacob probably
having fallen out (compare note 15, above). The work is intended to show
how the wise man should conduct himself in affairs of state or political
life. See Schürer, p. 849.

habeant,* as the title is given by Jerome (*de vir. ill.* c. 11). The
work is extant only in Armenian, and is given by Aucher, I. p. 123–172,
and in Latin by Ritter, Vol. VII. Two short Greek fragments are also
found in the *Florilegium* of Leontius and Johannes, according to
Schürer. This book is also one of the separate works of Philo, and
belongs to his later writings. See Schürer, p. 860 sqq.

formed originally the two halves of a single work, in which the subject
was treated from its two sides,—the slavery of the wicked man and the
freedom of the good man. The first half is lost; but the second half is
extant, and is given by Mangey (II. 445–470). A long fragment of the
extant second half is given also by Eusebius, in his *Præp. Evang.*
VIII. 12. The genuineness of the work has been disputed by some, but is
defended with success by Lucius, *Der Essenismus,* p. 13–23, Strasburg,
1881 (Schürer, p. 85).

id="iii.vii.xix-p40.1"></span>τῶν ἐν νόμῳ δὲ και προφήταις ᾽Εβραϊκῶν
ὀνομ€των αἱ ἑρμηνεῖαι</span>. The way in which Eusebius speaks of this
work (<span class="Greek"><span id="iii.vii.xix-p40.2"></span>τοῦ αὐτοῦ
σπουδαῖ εἰναι λέγονται</span>) shows that it lay before him as an
anonymous work, which, however, was “said to be the result of Philo’s
industry.” Jerome, too, in speaking of the same work (at the beginning
of his own work, *De nominibus Hebraicis*), says that, according to the
testimony of Origen, it was the work of Philo. For Jerome, too,
therefore, it was an anonymous work. This testimony of Origen cannot,
according to Schürer, be found in his extant works, but in his *Comment.
in Joann.* II. 27 (ed. Lommatzsch, I. 50) he speaks of a work upon the
same subject, the author of which he does not know. The book therefore
in view of the existing state of the tradition in regard to it, is
usually thought to be the work of some other writer than Philo. In its
original form it is no longer extant (and in the absence of this
original it is impossible to decide the question of authorship), though
there exist a number of works upon the same subject which are probably
based upon this lost original. Jerome, e.g., informs us that his *Liber
de Nominibus Hebraicis* (Migne, III. 771) is a revision of it. See
Schürer, p. 865 sq.

<span id="iii.vii.xix-p42"></span> “This report is very improbable, for
a work full of hatred to the Romans and of derogatory references to the
emperor Caligula could not have been read before the Roman Senate,
especially when the author was a Jew” (Closs). It is in fact quite
unlikely that Philo was in Rome during the reign of Claudius (see above,
chap. 17, note 1). The report given here by Eusebius owes its origin
perhaps to the imagination of some man who supposed that Philo was in
Rome during the reign of Claudius (on the ground of the other tradition
already referred to), and whose fancy led him to picture Philo as
obtaining at that time his revenge upon the emperor Caligula in this
dramatic way. It was not difficult to imagine that this bitterly
sarcastic and vivid work might have been intended for public reading,
and it was an attractive suggestion that the Senate might have
constituted the audience.
