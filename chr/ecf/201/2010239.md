<span id="iii.xii.xxii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xii.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXI</span>.—*The Occurrences at
Alexandria.*

<span id="iii.xii.xxii-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xii.xxii-p2.1"></span>Peace</span> had but just been restored
when he returned to Alexandria; <span
id="fr_2309"></span>[2310](#fn_2309.md) but as sedition and war broke out
again, rendering it impossible for him to oversee all the brethren,
separated in different places by the insurrection, at the feast of the
passover, as if he were still an exile from Alexandria, he addressed
them again by letter. <span id="fr_2310"></span>[2311](#fn_2310.md)

<span id="iii.xii.xxii-p5"></span>2. And in another festal epistle
written later to Hierax, <span id="fr_2311"></span>[2312](#fn_2311.md) a
bishop in Egypt, he mentions the sedition then prevailing in Alexandria,
as follows:

<span id="iii.xii.xxii-p7"></span>“What wonder is it that it is
difficult for me to communicate by letters with those who live far away,
when it is beyond my power even to reason with myself, or to take
counsel for my own life?

<span id="iii.xii.xxii-p8"></span>3. Truly I need to send letters to
those who are as my own bowels, <span
id="fr_2312"></span>[2313](#fn_2312.md) dwelling in one home, and brethren
of one soul, and citizens of the same church; but how to send them I
cannot tell. For it would be easier for one to go, not only beyond the
limits of the province, but even from the East to the West, than from
Alexandria to Alexandria itself.

<span id="iii.xii.xxii-p10"></span><span id="page_306">p. 306</span>
<span id="iii.xii.xxii-Page_306"></span>4. For the very heart of the
city is more intricate and impassable than that great and trackless
desert which Israel traversed for two generations. And our smooth and
waveless harbors have become like the sea, divided and walled up,
through which Israel drove and in whose highway the Egyptians were
overwhelmed. For often from the slaughters there committed they appear
like the Red Sea.

<span id="iii.xii.xxii-p11"></span>5. And the river which flows by the
city has sometimes seemed drier than the waterless desert, and more
parched than that in which Israel, as they passed through it, so
suffered for thirst, that they cried out against Moses, and the water
flowed for them from the steep rock, <span
id="fr_2313"></span>[2314](#fn_2313.md) through him who alone doeth
wonders.

<span id="iii.xii.xxii-p13"></span>6. Again it has overflowed so greatly
as to flood all the surrounding country, and the roads and the fields;
threatening to bring back the deluge of water that occurred in the days
of Noah. And it flows along, polluted always with blood and slaughter
and drownings, as it became for Pharaoh through the agency of Moses,
when he changed it into blood, and it stank. <span
id="fr_2314"></span>[2315](#fn_2314.md)

<span id="iii.xii.xxii-p15"></span>7. And what other water could purify
the water which purifies everything? How could the ocean, so great and
impassable for men, if poured into it, cleanse this bitter sea? Or how
could the great river which flowed out of Eden, if it poured the four
heads into which it is divided into the one of Geon, <span
id="fr_2315"></span>[2316](#fn_2315.md) wash away this pollution?

<span id="iii.xii.xxii-p17"></span>8. Or when can the air poisoned by
these noxious exhalations become pure? For such vapors arise from the
earth, and winds from the sea, and breezes from the river, and mists
from the harbors, that the dews are, as it were, discharges from dead
bodies putrefying in all the elements around us.

<span id="iii.xii.xxii-p18"></span>9. Yet men wonder and cannot
understand whence these continuous pestilences; whence these severe
sicknesses; whence these deadly diseases of all kinds; whence this
various and vast human destruction; why this great city no longer
contains as many inhabitants, from tender infants to those most advanced
in life, as it formerly contained of those whom it called hearty old
men. But the men from forty to seventy years of age were then so much
more numerous that their number cannot now be filled out, even when
those from fourteen to eighty years are enrolled and registered for the
public allowance of food.

<span id="iii.xii.xxii-p19"></span>10. And the youngest in appearance
have become, as it were, of equal age with those who formerly were the
oldest. But though they see the race of men thus constantly diminishing
and wasting away, and though their complete destruction is increasing
and advancing, they do not tremble.”
