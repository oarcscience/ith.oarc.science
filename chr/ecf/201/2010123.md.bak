<span id="iii.ix.xiv-p1"></span> <span id="page_187">p. 187</span> <span

id="iii.ix.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter</span> <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.ix.xiv-p1.2"></span>XIV.—</span>*The Circumstances related of
Polycarp, a Friend of the Apostles*.

<span id="iii.ix.xiv-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.ix.xiv-p2.1"></span>At</span> this time, while Anicetus was at
the head of the church of Rome, <span
id="fr_1111"></span>[1112](#fn_1111.md) Irenæus relates that Polycarp, who
was still alive, was at Rome, <span id="fr_1112"></span>[1113](#fn_1112.md)
and that he had a conference with Anicetus on a question concerning the
day of the paschal feast. <span id="fr_1113"></span>[1114](#fn_1113.md)

<span id="iii.ix.xiv-p6"></span>2. And the same writer gives another
account of Polycarp which I feel constrained to add to that which has
been already related in regard to him. The account is taken from the
third book of Irenæus’ work Against Heresies, and is as follows: <span
id="fr_1114"></span>[1115](#fn_1114.md)

<span id="iii.ix.xiv-p8"></span>3. “But Polycarp <span
id="fr_1115"></span>[1116](#fn_1115.md) also was not only instructed by the
apostles, and acquainted with many that had seen Christ, but was also
appointed by apostles in Asia bishop of the church of Smyrna. <span
id="fr_1116"></span>[1117](#fn_1116.md)

<span id="iii.ix.xiv-p11"></span>4. We too saw him in our early youth;
for he lived a long time, and died, when a very old man, a glorious and
most illustrious martyr’s death, <span
id="fr_1117"></span>[1118](#fn_1117.md) having always taught the things
which he had learned from the apostles, which the Church also hands
down, and which alone are true. <span
id="fr_1118"></span>[1119](#fn_1118.md)

<span id="iii.ix.xiv-p14"></span>5. To these things all the Asiatic
churches testify, as do also those who, down to the present time, have
succeeded Polycarp, <span id="fr_1119"></span>[1120](#fn_1119.md) who was a
much more trustworthy and certain witness of the truth than Valentinus
and Marcion and the rest of the heretics. <span
id="fr_1120"></span>[1121](#fn_1120.md) He also was in Rome in the time of
Anicetus <span id="fr_1121"></span>[1122](#fn_1121.md) and caused many to
turn away from the above-mentioned heretics to the Church of God,
proclaiming that he had received from the apostles this one and only
system of truth which has been transmitted by the Church.

<span id="iii.ix.xiv-p18"></span>6. And there are those that heard from
him that John, the disciple of the Lord, going to bathe in Ephesus and
seeing Cerinthus within, ran out of the bath-house without bathing,
crying, ‘Let us flee, lest even the bath fall, because Cerinthus, the
enemy of the truth, is within.’ <span
id="fr_1122"></span>[1123](#fn_1122.md)

<span id="iii.ix.xiv-p20"></span>7. And Polycarp himself, when Marcion
once met him <span id="fr_1123"></span>[1124](#fn_1123.md) and said,
‘Knowest <span id="fr_1124"></span>[1125](#fn_1124.md) thou us?’ replied,
‘I know the first born of Satan.’ Such caution did the apostles and
their disciples exercise that they might not even converse with any of
those who perverted the truth; as Paul also said, ‘A man that is a
heretic, after the first and second admonition, <span id="page_188">p.
188</span> <span id="iii.ix.xiv-Page_188"></span>reject; knowing he that
is such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself.’ <span
id="fr_1125"></span>[1126](#fn_1125.md)

<span id="iii.ix.xiv-p24"></span>8. There is also a very powerful
epistle of Polycarp written to the Philippians, <span
id="fr_1126"></span>[1127](#fn_1126.md) from which those that wish to do
so, and that are concerned for their own salvation, may learn the
character of his faith and the preaching of the truth.” Such is the
account of Irenæus.

<span id="iii.ix.xiv-p26"></span>9. But Polycarp, in his above-mentioned
epistle to the Philippians, which is still extant, has made use of
certain testimonies drawn from the First Epistle of Peter. <span
id="fr_1127"></span>[1128](#fn_1127.md)

<span id="iii.ix.xiv-p28"></span>10. And when Antoninus, called Pius,
had completed the twenty-second year of his reign, <span
id="fr_1128"></span>[1129](#fn_1128.md) Marcus Aurelius Verus, his son, who
was also called Antoninus, succeeded him, together with his brother
Lucius. <span id="fr_1129"></span>[1130](#fn_1129.md)

<span id="iii.ix.xiv-p3"></span> On Anicetus, see above, chap. 11, note
18. He was bishop probably from 154 to 165 <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.ix.xiv-p3.1"></span>a.d.</span>

<span id="iii.ix.xiv-p4"></span> γένεσθαι ἐπὶ ῾Ρώμης. It is quite
commonly said that Polycarp came to Rome during the episcopate of
Anicetus; but our authorities say only that he was in Rome at that time,
and do not specify the date at which he arrived there. Neither these
words, nor the words of Irenæus in §5 below (ἐπιδηυήσας τῇ ῾Ρώμη), are
to be translated “came to Rome,” as is often done (e.g. by Crusè, by
Roberts and Rambaut, in their translation of Irenæus, and by Salmon, in
the *Dict. of Christ. Biog*.), but “was at Rome” (as Closs, Stigloher,
Lightfoot, &c., correctly render the words). Inasmuch as Polycarp
suffered martyrdom in 155 or 156 <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.ix.xiv-p4.1"></span>a.d.</span>(see below, chap. 15, note 2), he
must have left Rome soon after Anticetus’ accession (which took place
probably in 154); and though of course he may have come thither sometime
before that event, still the fact that his stay there is connected with
Anicetus’ episcopate, and his alone, implies that he went thither either
immediately after, or shortly before Anicetus became bishop.

<span id="fn_1113"></span>[187:1114](2010123.htm#fr_1113.md) <span
id="iii.ix.xiv-p4.2"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.xiv-p5"></span> On the paschal controversies of the
early Church, see below, Bk. V. chap. 23, note 1. We learn from Bk. V.
chap. 24, that though Polycarp and Anicetus did not reach an agreement
on the subject, they nevertheless remained good friends, and that
Polycarp celebrated the eucharist in Rome at the request of Anicetus.

<span id="fn_1114"></span>[187:1115](2010123.htm#fr_1114.md) <span
id="iii.ix.xiv-p6.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.xiv-p7"></span> Irenæus, *Adv. Hær*. III. 3. 4.

<span id="fn_1115"></span>[187:1116](2010123.htm#fr_1115.md) <span
id="iii.ix.xiv-p8.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.xiv-p9"></span> Eusebius takes his account of Polycarp
solely from Irenæus, and from the epistle of the church of Smyrna, given
in the next chapter. He is mentioned by Irenæus again in his *Adv. Hær*.
V. 33. 4 (quoted by Eusebius in Bk. III. chap. 39), and in his epistle
to Florinus and to Victor. From the epistle to Florinus (quoted below in
Bk. V. chap. 20), where quite an account of Polycarp is given, we learn
that the latter was Irenæus’ teacher. He was one of the most celebrated
men of the time, not because of his ability or scholarship, but because
he had been a personal friend of some of the disciples of the Lord, and
lived to a great age, when few if any were still alive that had known
the first generation of Christians. He suffered martyrdom about 155
<span class="c13"><span id="iii.ix.xiv-p9.1"></span>a.d.</span> (see
below, chap. 15, note 2); and as he was at least eighty-six years old at
the time of his death (see the next chap., §20), he must have been born
as early as 70 <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.ix.xiv-p9.2"></span>a.d</span>. He was a personal disciple of
John the apostle, as we learn from Irenæus’ epistle to Florinus, and was
acquainted also with others that had seen the Lord. That he was at the
head of the church of Smyrna cannot be doubted (cf. Ignatius’ epistle to
him), but Irenæus’ statement that he was appointed bishop of Smyrna by
apostles is probably to be looked upon as a combination of his own. He
reasoned that bishops were the successors of the apostles; Polycarp was
a bishop, and lived in the time of the apostles; and therefore he must
have been appointed by them. The only known writing of Polycarp’s is his
epistle to the Philippians, which is still extant (see below, note 16).
His character is plainly revealed in that epistle as well as in the
accounts given us by Irenæus and by the church of Smyrna in their
epistle. He was a devoutly pious and simple-minded Christian, burning
with intense personal love for his Master, and yet not at all fanatical
like his contemporary Ignatius. The instances related in this chapter
show his intense horror of heretics, of those whom he believed to be
corrupting the doctrine of Christ, and yet he does not seem to have had
the taste or talent to refute their errors. He simply wished to avoid
them as instruments of Satan. He was pre-eminently a man that lived in
the past. His epistle is full of reminiscences of New Testament thought
and language, and his chief significance to the Christians of the second
century was as a channel of apostolic tradition. He does not compare
with Ignatius for vigor and originality of thought, and yet he was one
of the most deeply venerated characters of the early Church, his noble
piety, his relation to John and other disciples of the Lord, and finally
his glorious martyrdom, contributing to make him such. Upon Polycarp,
see especially Lightfoot’s edition of Ignatius and Polycarp, and the
article of Salmon, in Smith and Wace’s *Dict. of Christ. Biog*.

<span id="iii.ix.xiv-p10"></span> The church of Smyrna (situated in Asia
Minor) was one of the “seven churches of Asia,” and is mentioned in
<span id="iii.ix.xiv-p10.1"></span>[Rev. i.
11](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#011.md)<span id="iii.ix.xiv-p10.2"></span>;

<span id="fn_1117"></span>[187:1118](2010123.htm#fr_1117.md) <span
id="iii.ix.xiv-p11.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.xiv-p12"></span> On his age and the date of his death,
see chap. 15, note 2. A full account of his martyrdom is given in the
epistle of the church of Smyrna, quoted in the next chapter.

<span id="fn_1118"></span>[187:1119](2010123.htm#fr_1118.md) <span
id="iii.ix.xiv-p12.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.xiv-p13"></span> Irenæus emphasizes here, as was his
wont, the importance of tradition in determining true doctrine. Compare
also Eusebius’ words in chap. 21.

<span id="fn_1119"></span>[187:1120](2010123.htm#fr_1119.md) <span
id="iii.ix.xiv-p14.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.xiv-p15"></span> Of these successors of Polycarp we
know nothing.

id="iii.ix.xiv-p20.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.xiv-p21"></span> Marcion came to Rome about 135 <span
class="c13"><span id="iii.ix.xiv-p21.1"></span>a.d</span>., but how long
he remained there we do not know. Polycarp’s words show the great
abhorrence in which he was held by the Church. He was considered by many
the most dangerous of all the heretics, for he propagated his errors and
secured many followers among all classes. Marcion’s conduct in this case
is very significant when compared with that of the Gnostics. He tried
everywhere to gain support and to make friends with the Church, that he
might introduce his reforms within it; while the genuine Gnostics, on
the contrary, held themselves aloof from the Church, in pride and in a
feeling of superiority. Polycarp in his Epistle to the Philippians,
chap. 7, shows the same severity toward false teachers, and even uses
the same expression, “first born of Satan,” perhaps referring to Marcion
himself; but see below, note 16.

<span id="fn_1124"></span>[187:1125](2010123.htm#fr_1124.md) <span
id="iii.ix.xiv-p21.2"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.xiv-p22"></span> ἐπιγινώσκεις, which is the reading of
the great majority of the <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.ix.xiv-p22.1"></span>mss</span>., and is adopted by Schwegler,
Laemmer, Harnack, Lightfoot, and others. Three <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.ix.xiv-p22.2"></span>mss</span>., supported by Nicephorus,
Rufinus, and the Latin version of Irenæus, read ἐπιγίνωσκε, and this is
adopted by Valesius, Heinichen, Stroth, Closs, and Crusè.

<span id="fn_1125"></span>[188:1126](2010123.htm#fr_1125.md) <span

<span id="fn_1126"></span>[188:1127](2010123.htm#fr_1126.md) <span
id="iii.ix.xiv-p24.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.xiv-p25"></span> Polycarp’s Epistle to the Philippians
is still extant, and is the only work of Polycarp which we have. (The
Greek text is given in all editions of the apostolic Fathers, and with
especially valuable notes and discussions in Zahn’s *Ignatius von
Antiochien*, and in Lightfoot’s *Ignatius and Polycarp*, II. p. 897
sqq.; an English translation is contained in the latter edition, and
also in the *Ante-Nicene Fathers*, Vol. I. p. 31–36.) The date of its
composition it is very difficult to determine. It must have been written
after the death of Ignatius (chap. 9), and yet soon after, as Polycarp
does not seem to know all the circumstances attending that event (see
chap. 13). Its date therefore depends upon the date of the martyrdom of
Ignatius, which is a very difficult question, not yet fully decided. The
attack upon false teachers reminds us of Marcion, and contains traits
which seem to imply that Polycarp had Marcion in his mind at the time of
writing. If this be so, the epistle was written as late as 135 <span
class="c13"><span id="iii.ix.xiv-p25.1"></span>a.d</span>., which puts
the date of Ignatius’ death much later than the traditional date (on the
date of Ignatius’ death, see above, Bk. III. chap. 36, note 4). The
genuineness of Polycarp’s epistle has been sharply disputed—chiefly on
account of its testimony to the Ignatian epistles in chap. 13. Others,
while acknowledging its genuineness as a whole, have regarded chap. 13
as an interpolation. But the external testimony for its genuineness is
very strong, beginning with Irenæus, and the epistle itself is just what
we should expect from such a man as Polycarp. There is no good reason
therefore to doubt its genuineness nor the genuineness of chap. 13, the
rejection of which is quite arbitrary. The genuineness of the whole has
been ably defended both by Zahn and by Lightfoot, and may be regarded as
definitely established.

<span id="fn_1127"></span>[188:1128](2010123.htm#fr_1127.md) <span
id="iii.ix.xiv-p26.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.xiv-p27"></span> Polycarp in his epistle makes constant
use of the First Epistle of Peter, with which he was evidently very
familiar, though it is remarkable that he nowhere mentions Peter as its
author (cf. Bk. III. chap. 3, note 1).

<span id="fn_1128"></span>[188:1129](2010123.htm#fr_1128.md) <span
id="iii.ix.xiv-p28.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.xiv-p29"></span> Antoninus Pius reigned from July 2,
138, to March 7, 161.

Pius. See above, chap. 12, note 3.
