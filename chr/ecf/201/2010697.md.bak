<span id="iv.viii.viii"></span>

<span id="iv.viii.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.viii.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII.</span>

<span id="iv.viii.viii-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iv.viii.viii-p2.1"></span>For</span> whereas we are composed of two
distinct natures, I mean of body and spirit, of which the one is visible
to all, the other invisible, against both these natures two kinds of
barbarous and savage enemies, the one invisibly, the other openly, are
constantly arrayed. <span id="page_590">p. 590</span> <span
id="iv.viii.viii-Page_590"></span>The one oppose our bodies with bodily
force: the other with incorporeal assaults besiege the naked soul
itself.

<span id="iv.viii.viii-p3"></span>2. Again, the visible barbarians, like
the wild nomad tribes, no better than savage beasts, assail the nations
of civilized men, ravage their country, and enslave their cities,
rushing on those who inhabit them like ruthless wolves of the desert,
and destroying all who fall under their power. But those unseen foes,
more cruel far than barbarians, I mean the soul-destroying demons whose
course is through the regions of the air, had succeeded, through the
snares of vile polytheism, in enslaving the entire human race, insomuch
that they no longer recognized the true God, but wandered in the mazes
of atheistic error. For they procured, I know not whence, gods who never
anywhere existed, and set him aside who is the only and the true God, as
though he were not.

<span id="iv.viii.viii-p4"></span>3. Accordingly the generation of
bodies was esteemed by them a deity, and so the opposite principle to
this, their dissolution and destruction, was also deified. The first, as
the author of generative power, was honored with rites under the name of
Venus: <span id="fr_3524"></span>[3525](#fn_3524.md) the second, as rich,
and mighty in dominion over the human race, received the names of Pluto,
and Death. For men in those ages, knowing no other than naturally
generated life, declared the cause and origin of that life to be divine:
and again, believing in no existence after death, they proclaimed Death
himself a universal conqueror and a mighty god. Hence, unconscious of
responsibility, as destined to be annihilated by death, they lived a
life unworthy of the name, in the practice of actions deserving a
thousand deaths. No thought of God could enter their minds, no
expectation of Divine judgment, no recollection of, no reflection on,
their spiritual existence: acknowledging one dread superior, Death, and
persuaded that the dissolution of their bodies by his power was final
annihilation, they bestowed on Death the title of a mighty, a wealthy
god, and hence the name of Pluto. <span
id="fr_3525"></span>[3526](#fn_3525.md) Thus, then, Death became to them a
god; nor only so, but whatever else they accounted precious in
comparison with death, whatever contributed to the luxuries of life.

<span id="iv.viii.viii-p7"></span>4. Hence animal pleasure became to
them a god; nutrition, and its production, a god; the fruit of trees, a
god; drunken riot, a god; carnal desire and pleasure, a god. Hence the
mysteries of Ceres and Proserpine, the rape of the latter, and her
subsequent restoration, by Pluto: hence the orgies of Bacchus, and
Hercules overcome by drunkenness as by a mightier god: hence the
adulterous rites of Cupid and of Venus: hence Jupiter himself infatuated
with the love of women, and of Ganymede: <span
id="fr_3526"></span>[3527](#fn_3526.md) hence the licentious legends of
deities abandoned to effeminacy and pleasure.

<span id="iv.viii.viii-p9"></span>5. Such were the weapons of
superstition whereby these cruel barbarians and enemies of the Supreme
God afflicted, and indeed entirely subdued, the human race; erecting
everywhere the monuments of impiety, and rearing in every corner the
shrines and temples of their false religion.

<span id="iv.viii.viii-p10"></span>6. Nay, so far were the ruling powers
of those times enslaved by the force of error, as to appease their gods
with the blood of their own countrymen and kindred; to whet their swords
against those who stood forward to defend the truth; to maintain a
ruthless war and raise unholy hands, not against foreign or barbarian
foes, but against men bound to them by the ties of family and affection,
against brethren, and kinsmen, and dearest friends, who had resolved, in
the practice of virtue and true piety, to honor and worship God.

<span id="iv.viii.viii-p11"></span>7. Such was the spirit of madness
with which these princes sacrificed to their demon deities men
consecrated to the service of the King of kings. On the other hand their
victims, as noble martyrs in the cause of true godliness, resolved to
welcome a glorious death in preference to life itself, and utterly
despised these cruelties. Strengthened, as soldiers of God, with patient
fortitude, they mocked at death in all its forms; at fire, and sword,
and the torment of crucifixion; at exposure to savage beasts, and
drowning in the depths of the sea; at the cutting off and searing of
limbs, the digging out of eyes, the mutilation of the whole body;
lastly, at famine, the labor of the mines, and captivity: nay, all these
sufferings they counted better than any earthly good or pleasure, for
the love they bore their heavenly King. In like manner women also
evinced a spirit of constancy and courage not inferior to that of men.

<span id="iv.viii.viii-p12"></span>8. Some endured the same conflicts
with them, and obtained a like reward of their virtue: others, forcibly
carried off to be the victims of violence and pollution, welcomed death
rather than dishonor; while many, very many more, endured not even to
hear the same threats wherewith they were assailed by the provincial
governors, but boldly sustained every variety of torture, and sentence
of death in every form. <span id="fr_3527"></span>[3528](#fn_3527.md) Thus
did these valiant soldiers of the Almighty Sovereign maintain the
conflict with steadfast fortitude of soul against the hostile forces of
polytheism: and thus did these enemies of God and adversaries of man’s
salvation, more cruel far than the ferocious savage, delight in
libations of human blood: thus did <span id="page_591">p. 591</span>
<span id="iv.viii.viii-Page_591"></span>their ministers drain as it were
the cup of unrighteous slaughter in honor of the demons whom they
served, and prepare for them this dread and impious banquet, to the ruin
of the human race.

<span id="iv.viii.viii-p14"></span>9. In these sad circumstances, what
course should the God and King of these afflicted ones pursue? Could he
be careless of the safety of his dearest friends or abandon his servants
in this great extremity? Surely none could deem him a wary pilot, who,
without an effort to save his fellow-mariners should suffer his vessel
to sink with all her crew: surely no general could be found so reckless
as to yield his own allies, without resistance, to the mercy of the foe:
nor can a faithful shepherd regard with unconcern the straying of a
single sheep from his flock, but will rather leave the rest in safety,
and dare all things for the wanderer’s sake, even, if need be, to
contend with savage beasts.

<span id="iv.viii.viii-p15"></span>10. The zeal, however, of the great
Sovereign of all was for no unconscious <span
id="fr_3528"></span>[3529](#fn_3528.md) sheep: his care was exercised for
his own faithful host, for those who sustained the battle for his sake:
whose conflicts in the cause of godliness he himself approved, and
honored those who had returned to his presence with the prize of victory
which he only can bestow, uniting them to the angelic choirs. Others he
still preserved on earth, to communicate the living seeds of piety to
future generations; to be at once eye-witnesses of his vengeance on the
ungodly, and narrators of the events.

<span id="iv.viii.viii-p17"></span>11. After this he outstretched his
arm in judgment on the adversaries, and utterly destroyed them with the
stroke of Divine wrath, compelling them, how reluctant soever to confess
with their own lips and recant their wickedness, but raising from the
ground and exalting gloriously those who had long been oppressed and
disclaimed by all.

<span id="iv.viii.viii-p18"></span>12. Such were the dealings of the
Supreme Sovereign, who ordained an invincible champion to be the
minister of his heaven-sent vengeance (for our emperor’s surpassing
piety delights in the title of Servant of God), and him he has proved
victorious over all that opposed him, having raised him up, an
individual against many foes. For they were indeed numberless, being the
friends of many evil spirits (though in reality they were nothing, and
hence are now no more); but our emperor is one, appointed by, and the
representative of, the one Almighty Sovereign. And they, in the very
spirit of impiety, destroyed the righteous with cruel slaughter: but he,
in imitation of his Saviour, and knowing only how to save men’s lives,
has spared and instructed in godliness the impious themselves.

<span id="iv.viii.viii-p19"></span>13. And so, as truly worthy the name
of <span class="c13"><span id="iv.viii.viii-p19.1"></span>Victor</span>,
he has subdued the twofold race of barbarians; soothing the savage
tribes of men by prudent embassies, compelling them to know and
acknowledge their superiors, and reclaiming them from a lawless and
brutal life to the governance of reason and humanity; at the same time
that he proved by the facts themselves that the fierce and ruthless race
of unseen spirits had long ago been vanquished by a higher power. For he
who is the preserver of the universe had punished these invisible
spirits by an invisible judgment: and our emperor, as the delegate of
the Supreme Sovereign, has followed up the victory, bearing away the
spoils of those who have long since died and mouldered into dust, and
distributing the plunder with lavish hand among the soldiers of his
victorious Lord. <span id="fr_3529"></span>[3530](#fn_3529.md)
