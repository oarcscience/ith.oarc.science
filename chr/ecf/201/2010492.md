id="iv.vi.ii.xlvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLVII</span>.—*That he wrote a
Letter in Condemnation of Idolatry.*

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xlvii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.xlvii-p2.1"></span>Moreover</span>, the emperor, who
continually made progress in piety towards God, dispatched an admonitory
letter to the inhabitants of every province, respecting the error of
idolatry into which his predecessors in power had fallen, in which he
eloquently exhorts his subjects to acknowledge the Supreme God, and
openly to profess their allegiance to his Christ as their Saviour. This
letter also, which is in his own handwriting, I have judged it necessary
to translate from the Latin for the present work, in order that we may
hear, as it were, the voice the emperor himself uttering these
sentiments in the audience of all mankind.
