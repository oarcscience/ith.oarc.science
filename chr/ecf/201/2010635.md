year of his reign he solemnized the marriage of his second son, <span
id="fr_3346"></span>[3347](#fn_3346) having concluded that of his
first-born long before. This was an occasion of great joy and festivity,
the emperor himself attending on his son at the ceremony, and
entertaining the guests of both sexes, the men and women in distinct and
separate companies, with sumptuous hospitality. Rich presents likewise
were liberally distributed among the cities and people.
