id="iv.vi.iii.xlix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLIX</span>.—*Representation of
the Cross in the Palace, and of Daniel at the Public Fountains.*

<span id="iv.vi.iii.xlix-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.xlix-p2.1"></span>On</span> the other hand one might see
the fountains in the midst of the market place graced with figures
representing the good Shepherd, well known to those who study the sacred
oracles, and that of Daniel also with the lions, forged in brass, and
resplendent with plates of gold. Indeed, so large a measure of Divine
love possessed the emperor’s soul, that in the principal apartment of
the imperial palace itself, on a vast tablet <span
id="fr_3281"></span>[3282](#fn_3281) displayed in the center of its
gold-covered paneled ceiling, he caused the symbol of our Saviour’s
Passion to be fixed, composed of a variety of precious stones richly
inwrought with gold. This symbol he seemed to have intended to be as it
were the safeguard of the empire itself.

restored church of St. Paul, outside the walls at Rome, has a paneled
ceiling with a very large central panel.
