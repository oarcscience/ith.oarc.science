<span id="iii.xv.ii-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xv.ii-p2.1"></span>But</span> the tyrant who, as we have said,
ruled over the districts of the Orient, a thorough hater of the good and
an enemy of every virtuous person, as he was, could no longer bear this;
and indeed he did not permit matters to go on in this way quite six
months. <span id="fr_2718"></span>[2719](#fn_2718.md) Devising all possible
means of destroying the peace, he first attempted to restrain us, under
a pretext, <span id="fr_2719"></span>[2720](#fn_2719.md) from meeting in
the cemeteries.

<span id="iii.xv.ii-p5"></span>2. Then through the agency of some wicked
men he sent an embassy to himself against us, <span
id="fr_2720"></span>[2721](#fn_2720.md) inciting the citizens of Antioch to
ask from him as a very great favor that he would by no means permit any
of the Christians to dwell in their country; and others were secretly
induced to do the same thing. The author of all this in Antioch was
Theotecnus, <span id="fr_2721"></span>[2722](#fn_2721.md) a violent and
wicked man, who was an impostor, and whose character was foreign to his
name. <span id="fr_2722"></span>[2723](#fn_2722.md) He appears to have been
the curator <span id="fr_2723"></span>[2724](#fn_2723.md) of the city.

<span id="iii.xv.ii-p3"></span> The Edict of Galerius was issued in
April, 311 (see Lactantius, *de Mort. pers.* 35, and Bk. VIII. chap. 17,
note 1, above), so that Maximin’s change of policy, recorded in this
chapter, must have begun in October, or thereabouts. Valesius supposes
that the death of Galerius was the cause of Maximin’s return to
persecuting measures. But Galerius died, not some months after the issue
of the edict, as Valesius, and others after him, assert, but within a
few days after it, as is directly stated by Lactantius (*ibid.*), whose
accuracy in this case there is no reason to question. Another
misstatement made by Valesius in the same connection, and repeated by
Heinichen, Crusè, and others, is that Maximin became Augustus only after
the death of Galerius. The truth is, he was recognized as an Augustus in
308 (see Lactantius, *ibid.* chap. 32; and Bk. VIII. chap. 13, note 22,
above). The cause of the renewal of the persecution seems to have been
simply impatience at the exultation of the Church and at the wonderful
recuperative power revealed the moment the pressure was taken off. That
it was not renewed sooner was doubtless due to the more important
matters which engaged the attention of Maximinus immediately after the
death of Galerius, in connection with the division of the Eastern Empire
between himself and Licinius (see Lactantius, *ibid.* chap. 36). It
would seem from the passage just referred to, that as soon as these
matters were satisfactorily adjusted, Maximin turned his attention again
to the Christians, and began to curtail their liberty.

id="iii.xv.ii-p3.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xv.ii-p4"></span> Very likely under the pretext that night
gatherings at the tombs of the martyrs, with the excitement and
enthusiasm necessarily engendered under such circumstances, were of
immoral tendency. Naturally, the honor shown by the Christians to their
fellows who had been put to death at the command of the state was looked
upon as an insult to the authorities, and could not but be very
distasteful to them. They imagined that such meetings would only tend to
foster discontent and disloyalty on the part of those who engaged in
them, and consequently they were always suspicious of them.

<span id="fn_2720"></span>[358:2721](2010287.htm#fr_2720.md) <span
id="iii.xv.ii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xv.ii-p6"></span> The same account is given by Lactantius,
*ibid.* chap. 36 (“First of all he took away the toleration and general
protection granted by Galerius to the Christians, and, for this end, he
secretly procured addresses for the different cities, requesting that no
Christian church might be built within their walls; and thus he meant to
make that which was his own choice appear as if extorted from him by
importunity”). It is possible that the account is correct, but it is
more probable that the embassies were genuine, and were voluntarily sent
to the emperor, while he was on a tour through his dominions, by the
pagan population of some of the cities who knew the emperor’s own
position in the matter, and desired to conciliate him and secure favors
from him. Of course such deputations would delight him greatly; and what
one city did, others would feel compelled to do also, in order not to
seem behindhand in religious zeal and in order not to run the risk of
offending the emperor, who since the death of Galerius was of course a
more absolute master than before. Cf. Mason, p. 313 sq.

<span id="iii.xv.ii-p7"></span> Theotecnus, according to the *Passion of
St. Theodotus* (translated in Mason, p. 354 sq.) an apostate from
Christianity, was for some time chief magistrate of Galatia, where he
indulged in the most terrible cruelties against the Christians. Beyond
the account given in the *Passion* referred to we know in regard to
Theotecnus only what is told us by Eusebius in the present book, in
which he is frequently mentioned. His hatred of the Christians knew no
bounds. He seems, moreover, to have been something of a philosopher and
literary man (Mason calls him a Neo-Platonist, and makes him the author
of the anti-Christian *Acta Pilati;* but see below, chap. 5, note 1). He
was executed by command of Licinius, after the death of Maximinus (see
below, chap. 11).
