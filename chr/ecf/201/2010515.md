question and the inconsiderate answer receive your mutual
forgiveness. <span id="fr_3219"></span>[3220](#fn_3219.md) For the cause of
your difference has not been any of the leading doctrines or precepts of
the Divine law, nor has any new heresy respecting the worship of God
arisen among you. You are in truth of one and the same judgment: <span

communion and fellowship.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.lxx-p4"></span> \[The emperor seems at this time to
have had a very imperfect knowledge of the errors of the Arian heresy.
After the Council of Nice, at which he heard them fully explained, he
wrote of them in terms of decisive condemnation in his letter to the
Alexandrian church. Vide Socrates’ *Eccles. Hist.,* Bk. 1, ch.
9.—*Bag.*\] Neither at this time nor at any time does Constantine seem
to have entered very fully into an appreciation of doctrinal niceties.
Later he was more than tolerant of semi-Arianism. He seems to have
depended a good deal on the “explanations” of others, and to have been
led in a somewhat devious path in trying to follow all.
