<span id="iv.vi.iv.liv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.liv-p1.1"></span>Chapter LIV</span>.—*Of those who abused
His Extreme Benevolence for Avarice and Hypocrisy.*

<span id="iv.vi.iv.liv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.liv-p2.1"></span>In</span> like manner his mental <span
id="fr_3352"></span>[3353](#fn_3352.md) qualities reached the highest point
of human perfection. Indeed he was distinguished by every excellence of
character, but especially by benevolence; a virtue, however, which
subjected him to censure from many, in consequence of the baseness of
wicked men, who ascribed their own crimes to the emperor’s forbearance.
In truth I can myself bear testimony to the grievous evils which
prevailed during these times; I mean the violence of rapacious and
unprincipled men, who preyed on all classes of society alike, and the
scandalous hypocrisy of those who crept into the Church, and assumed the
name and character of Christians. His own benevolence and goodness of
heart, the genuineness of his own faith, and his truthfulness of
character, induced the emperor to credit the profession of these reputed
Christians, who craftily preserved the semblance of sincere affection
for his person. The confidence he reposed in such men sometimes forced
him into conduct unworthy of himself, of which envy took advantage to
cloud in this respect the luster of his character. <span

There is a striking touch of naturalness in this passage which tells for
the historical trustworthiness of the biographer, and though exposing
the fault of the emperor yet gives a rather pleasing glimpse of his
character.
