<span id="iii.xii.xxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xii.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXII</span>.—*The Pestilence
which came upon them.*

<span id="iii.xii.xxiii-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xii.xxiii-p2.1"></span>After</span> these events a pestilential
disease followed the war, and at the approach of the feast he wrote
again to the brethren, describing the sufferings consequent upon this
calamity. <span id="fr_2316"></span>[2317](#fn_2316.md)

<span id="iii.xii.xxiii-p4"></span>2. “To other men <span
id="fr_2317"></span>[2318](#fn_2317.md) the present might not seem to be a
suitable time for a festival. Nor indeed is this or any other time
suitable for them; neither sorrowful times, nor even such as might be
thought especially cheerful. <span id="fr_2318"></span>[2319](#fn_2318.md)
Now, indeed, everything is tears and every one is mourning, and wailings
resound daily through the city because of the multitude of the dead and
dying.

<span id="iii.xii.xxiii-p7"></span>3. For as it was written of the
firstborn of the Egyptians, so now ‘there has arisen a great cry, for
there is not a house where there is not one dead.’ <span
id="fr_2319"></span>[2320](#fn_2319.md) And would that this were all! <span
id="fr_2320"></span>[2321](#fn_2320.md)

<span id="iii.xii.xxiii-p10"></span>4. For many terrible things have
happened already. First, they drove us out; and when alone, and
persecuted, and put to death by all, even then we kept the feast. And
every place of affliction was to us a place of festival: field, desert,
ship, inn, prison; but the perfected martyrs kept the most joyous
festival of all, feasting in heaven.

<span id="iii.xii.xxiii-p11"></span>5. After these things war and famine
followed, which we endured in common with the heathen. But we bore alone
those things with which they afflicted us, and at the same time we
experienced also the effects of what they inflicted upon and suffered
from one another; and again, we rejoiced in the peace of Christ, which
he gave to us alone.

<span id="iii.xii.xxiii-p12"></span>6. “But after both we and they had
enjoyed a very brief season of rest this pestilence assailed us; to them
more dreadful than any dread, and more intolerable than any other
calamity; and, as one of their own writers has said, the only thing
which prevails over all hope. <span id="page_307">p. 307</span> <span
id="iii.xii.xxiii-Page_307"></span>But to us this was not so, but no
less than the other things was it an exercise and probation. For it did
not keep aloof even from us, but the heathen it assailed more severely.”

<span id="iii.xii.xxiii-p13"></span>7. Farther on he adds:

<span id="iii.xii.xxiii-p14"></span>“The most of our brethren were
unsparing in their exceeding love and brotherly kindness. They held fast
to each other and visited the sick fearlessly, and ministered to them
continually, serving them in Christ. And they died with them most
joyfully, taking the affliction of others, and drawing the sickness from
their neighbors to themselves and willingly receiving their pains. And
many who cared for the sick and gave strength to others died themselves
having transferred to themselves their death. And the popular saying
which always seems a mere expression of courtesy, they then made real in
action, taking their departure as the others’ ‘offscouring.’ <span
id="fr_2321"></span>[2322](#fn_2321.md)

<span id="iii.xii.xxiii-p16"></span>8. “Truly the best of our brethren
departed from life in this manner, including some presbyters and deacons
and those of the people who had the highest reputation; so that this
form of death, through the great piety and strong faith it exhibited,
seemed to lack nothing of martyrdom.

<span id="iii.xii.xxiii-p17"></span>9. And they took the bodies of the
saints in their open hands and in their bosoms, and closed their eyes
and their mouths; and they bore them away on their shoulders and laid
them out; and they clung to them and embraced them; and they prepared
them suitably with washings and garments. And after a little they
received like treatment themselves, for the survivors were continually
following those who had gone before them.

<span id="iii.xii.xxiii-p18"></span>10. “But with the heathen everything
was quite otherwise. They deserted those who began to be sick, and fled
from their dearest friends. And they cast them out into the streets when
they were half dead, and left the dead like refuse, unburied. They
shunned any participation or fellowship with death; which yet, with all
their precautions, it was not easy for them to escape.”

<span id="iii.xii.xxiii-p19"></span>11. After this epistle, when peace
had been restored to the city, he wrote another festal letter <span
id="fr_2322"></span>[2323](#fn_2322.md) to the brethren in Egypt, and again
several others besides this. And there is also a certain one extant On
the Sabbath, <span id="fr_2323"></span>[2324](#fn_2323.md) and another On
Exercise.

<span id="iii.xii.xxiii-p22"></span>12. Moreover, he wrote again an
epistle to Hermammon <span id="fr_2324"></span>[2325](#fn_2324.md) and the
brethren in Egypt, describing at length the wickedness of Decius and his
successors, and mentioning the peace under Gallienus.

<span id="fn_2316"></span>[306:2317](2010240.htm#fr_2316.md) <span
id="iii.xii.xxiii-p2.2"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.xxiii-p3"></span> This letter seems to have been
written shortly before Easter of the year 263; for the festal epistle to
Hierax, quoted in the last chapter, was written while the war was still
in progress (i.e. in 262), this one after its close. It does not seem to
have been a regular festal epistle so-called, for in §11, below, we are
told that Dionysius wrote a regular festal letter (<span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.xii.xxiii-p3.1"></span>ἑ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.xii.xxiii-p3.2"></span>ορταστικὴν
γραφήν</span>) to the brethren in Egypt, and that apparently in
connection with this same Easter of the year 263.

<span id="fn_2317"></span>[306:2318](2010240.htm#fr_2317.md) <span
id="iii.xii.xxiii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.xxiii-p5"></span> i.e. to the heathen.

<span id="fn_2318"></span>[306:2319](2010240.htm#fr_2318.md) <span
id="iii.xii.xxiii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.xxiii-p6"></span> i.e. there is no time when heathen
can fitly rejoice.

<span id="fn_2319"></span>[306:2320](2010240.htm#fr_2319.md) <span
id="iii.xii.xxiii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.xxiii-p8"></span> [Ex. xii.
30](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#030.md)<span
id="iii.xii.xxiii-p8.1"></span>.

<span id="fn_2320"></span>[306:2321](2010240.htm#fr_2320.md) <span
id="iii.xii.xxiii-p8.2"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.xxiii-p9"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xii.xxiii-p9.1"></span>καὶ ὄφελόν γε</span>, with the majority
of the <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xii.xxiii-p9.2"></span>mss.</span>, followed by Valesius,
Schwegler, and Heinichen. Stroth, Burton, and Zimmermann, upon the
authority of two <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xii.xxiii-p9.3"></span>mss.</span>, read <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.xii.xxiii-p9.4"></span>καὶ ὄφελόν γε
εἷς</span> (“and would that there were but one!”), a reading which
Valesius approves in his notes. The weight of <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xii.xxiii-p9.5"></span>ms.</span> authority, however, is with
the former, and it alone justifies the <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xii.xxiii-p9.6"></span>γ€ρ</span> of the following sentence.

<span id="fn_2321"></span>[307:2322](2010240.htm#fr_2321.md) <span
id="iii.xii.xxiii-p14.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.xxiii-p15"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xii.xxiii-p15.1"></span>περίψημα</span>; cf. <span
id="iii.xii.xxiii-p15.2"></span>[1 Cor. iv.
13](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#013.md)<span
id="iii.xii.xxiii-p15.3"></span>. Valesius suggests that this may have
been a humble and complimentary form of salutation among the
Alexandrians: <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xii.xxiii-p15.4"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xii.xxiii-p15.5"></span>γὼ εἰμὶ περίψημ€ σου</span> (cf. our
words, “Your humble servant”); or, as he thinks more probable, that the
expression had come to be habitually applied to the Christians by the
heathen. The former interpretation seems to me the only possible one in
view of the words immediately preceding: “which always seems a mere
expression of courtesy.” Certainly these words rule out the second
interpretation suggested by Valesius.

<span id="fn_2322"></span>[307:2323](2010240.htm#fr_2322.md) <span
id="iii.xii.xxiii-p19.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.xxiii-p20"></span> The connection into which this
festal epistle is brought with the letter just quoted would seem to
indicate that it was written not a whole year, but very soon after that
one. We may, therefore, look upon it as Dionysius’ festal epistle of the
year 263 (see above, note 1). Neither this nor the “several others”
spoken of just below is now extant.

<span id="fn_2323"></span>[307:2324](2010240.htm#fr_2323.md) <span
id="iii.xii.xxiii-p20.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.xxiii-p21"></span> This and the next epistle are no
longer extant, and we know neither the time of their composition nor the
persons to whom they were addressed.

<span id="fn_2324"></span>[307:2325](2010240.htm#fr_2324.md) <span
id="iii.xii.xxiii-p22.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.xxiii-p23"></span> On Hermammon and the epistle
addressed to him, see above, chap. 1, note 3. An extract from this same
epistle is given in that chapter and also in chap. 10.
