id="iii.xii.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII.—</span>*The Martyrs in
Cæsarea in Palestine.*

<span id="iii.xii.xiii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xii.xiii-p2.1"></span>During</span> the above-mentioned
persecution under Valerian, three men in Cæsarea in Palestine, being
conspicuous in their confession of Christ, were adorned with divine
martyrdom, becoming food for wild beasts. One of them was called
Priscus, another Malchus, and the name of the third was Alexander. <span
id="fr_2264"></span>[2265](#fn_2264.md) They say that these men, who lived
in the country, acted at first in a cowardly manner, as if they were
careless and thoughtless. For when the opportunity was given to those
who longed for the prize with heavenly desire, they treated it lightly,
lest they should seize the Crown of martyrdom prematurely. But having
deliberated on the matter, they hastened to Cæsarea, and went before the
judge and met the end we have mentioned. They relate that besides these,
in the same persecution and the same city, a certain woman endured a
similar conflict. But it is reported that she belonged to the sect of
Marcion. <span id="fr_2265"></span>[2266](#fn_2265.md)

<span id="iii.xii.xiii-p4"></span> Marcionitic martyrs are mentioned by
Eusebius in Bk. IV. chap. 15, and in *Martyrs of Pal.* chap. 10. In *H.
E.* V. 16, it is stated that the Marcionites as well as the Montanists
had many martyrs, but that the orthodox Christians did not acknowledge
them as Christians, and would not recognize them even when they were
martyred together. Of course they were all alike Christians in the eyes
of the state, and hence all alike subject to persecution.
