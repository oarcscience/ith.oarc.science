id="iii.xi.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter X.—</span>*The Bishops of Jerusalem.*

<span id="iii.xi.x-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xi.x-p2.1"></span>Narcissus</span> having departed, and no one
knowing where he was, those presiding over the neighboring churches
thought it best to ordain another bishop. His name was Dius. <span
id="fr_1818"></span>[1819](#fn_1818.md) He presided but a short time, and
Germanio succeeded him. He was followed by Gordius, <span
id="fr_1819"></span>[1820](#fn_1819.md) in whose time Narcissus appeared
again, as if raised from the dead. <span
id="fr_1820"></span>[1821](#fn_1820.md) And immediately the brethren
besought him to take the episcopate, as all admired him the more on
account of his retirement and philosophy, and especially because of the
punishment with which God had avenged him.

<span id="iii.xi.x-p3"></span> Of these three bishops, Dius, Germanio,
and Gordius, we know nothing more than is told us here. Syncellus
assigns eight years to Dius, four to Germanio, and five to Sardianus,
whom he names instead of Gordius. Epiphanius reports that Dius was
bishop until Severus (193 <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xi.x-p3.1"></span>a.d.</span>), and Gordius until Antonine (i.e.
Caracalla, 211 <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xi.x-p3.2"></span>a.d.</span>). But no reliance is to be placed
upon these figures or dates, as remarked above, Bk. V. chap. 12, note 2.

<span id="fn_1819"></span>[256:1820](2010180.htm#fr_1819.md) <span
id="iii.xi.x-p3.3"></span>

<span id="iii.xi.x-p4"></span> Eusebius and Epiphanius give <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.xi.x-p4.1"></span>Τόρδιος</span>, and
Jerome, Gordius; but the Armenian has Gordianus, and Syncellus, <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.xi.x-p4.2"></span>Σαρδιανός</span>. What
became of Gordius when Narcissus reappeared we do not know. He must have
died very speedily, or some compromise would have been made, as it
seems, which would have rendered the appointment of Alexander as
assistant bishop unnecessary.

<span id="iii.xi.x-p5"></span> Literally, “as if from a resurrection”

class="Greek"><span id="iii.xi.x-p5.2"></span>σπερ ἐξ
ἀναβιώσεως</span>).
