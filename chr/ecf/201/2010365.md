<span id="iv.iii.iii.v-p1"></span> §5. *Various*.

<span id="iv.iii.iii.v-p2"></span>Besides the more formal works
mentioned above, various conversations, sayings, bon mots, prayers, &c.,
are preserved, among which may be mentioned:

<span id="iv.iii.iii.v-p3"></span>1. *Memoirs of himself*, of which no
portion is extant. Writings of Constantine are mentioned by Lydus (p.
194, 226), but whether the writings referred to deserve the title given
by Burckhardt it is hard to say.

<span id="iv.iii.iii.v-p4"></span>2. *A form of prayer* given by
Constantine to his soldiers (*V. C*. 4. 20).

<span id="iv.iii.iii.v-p5"></span>3. *His address* when the memorials of
contendents, at Council of Nicæa, were brought to him (Soz. 1. 17).

<span id="iv.iii.iii.v-p6"></span>4. *The conversation with Acesius*,
for which Socrates vouches, closing, “O Acesius, set up a ladder, and do
you alone climb up to heaven.”

<span id="iv.iii.iii.v-p7"></span>5. *His rebuke to the courtier*
concerning covetousness (*V. C.* 4. 30).

<span id="iv.iii.iii.v-p8"></span>6. *His answer* when told his statues
had been stoned, “Strange, but I feel no wound” (“Chrysost. *Ad Pop.
Ant*.”).

<span id="iv.iii.iii.v-p9"></span>7. *His appeal to the bishops*,
requesting them to confer upon him the rite of baptism (*V. C*. 4. 62).

<span id="iv.iii.iii.v-p10"></span>8. *His Thanksgiving* after baptism
*and testimony* (*V. C*. 4. 63).

<span id="iv.iii.iii.v-p11"></span>In general, his writings were
composed in Latin, and translated into Greek by those appointed for this
special purpose (*V. C*. 4. 32). His general style is rhetorical, rather
profuse, and declamatory, abounding in pious allusion and exhortation,
as well as philosophical quotation and reflection. His works are
interesting to study and not without a touch here and there of genuine
literary interest. A remark on friendship, for example, unless it be a
product of his habit of borrowing the thoughts of other men more or less
directly, is delightful and most quotable. “For it often happens,” he
says, “that when a reconciliation is effected by the removal of the
causes of enmity, friendship becomes even sweeter than it was before”
(Const. to Alex. and Ar. in *V. C*. 2. 71).
