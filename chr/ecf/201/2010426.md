the Provinces; and Constantine’s Acts of Grace.*

<span id="iv.vi.i.xli-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.xli-p2.1"></span>Thus</span> the pious emperor, glorying in
the confession of the victorious cross, proclaimed the Son of God to the
Romans with great boldness of testimony. And the inhabitants of the
city, one and all, senate and people, reviving, as it were, from the
pressure of a bitter and tyrannical domination, seemed to enjoy purer
rays of light, and to be born again into a fresh and new life. All the
nations, too, as far as the limit of the western ocean, being set free
from the calamities which had heretofore beset them, and gladdened by
joyous festivals, ceased not to praise him as the victorious, the pious,
the common benefactor: all, indeed, with one voice and one mouth,
declared that Constantine had appeared by the grace of God as a general
blessing to mankind. The imperial edict also was everywhere published,
whereby those who had been wrongfully deprived of their estates were
permitted again to enjoy their own, while those who had unjustly
suffered exile were recalled to their homes. Moreover, he freed from
imprisonment, and from every kind of danger and fear, those who, by
reason of the tyrant’s cruelty, had been subject to these sufferings.
