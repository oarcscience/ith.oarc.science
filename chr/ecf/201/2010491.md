<span id="iv.vi.ii.xlvi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.xlvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLVI</span>.—*Constantine’s
Letter to Eusebius and Other Bishops, respecting the Building of
Churches, with Instructions to repair the Old, and erect New Ones on a
Larger Scale, with the Aid of the Provincial Governors.*

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xlvi-p2"></span>“<span class="c13"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.xlvi-p2.1"></span>Victor Constantinus, Maximus
Augustus</span>, to Eusebius.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xlvi-p3"></span>“Forasmuch as the unholy and willful
rule of tyranny has persecuted the servants of our Saviour until this
present time, I believe and have fully satisfied myself, best beloved
brother, that the buildings belonging to all the churches have either
become ruinous through actual neglect, or have received inadequate
attention from the dread of the violent spirit of the times.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xlvi-p4"></span>“But now, that liberty is restored,
and that serpent <span id="fr_3192"></span>[3193](#fn_3192.md) driven from
the administration of public affairs by the providence of the Supreme
God, and our instrumentality, we trust that all can see the efficacy of
the Divine power, and that they who through fear of persecution or
through unbelief have fallen into any errors, will now acknowledge the
true God, and adopt in future that course of life which is according to
truth and rectitude. With respect, therefore, to the churches over which
you yourself preside, as well as the bishops, presbyters, and deacons of
other churches with whom you are acquainted, do you admonish all to be
zealous in their attention to the buildings of the churches, and either
to repair or enlarge those which at present exist, or, in cases of
necessity, to erect new ones.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xlvi-p6"></span>“We also empower you, and the others
through you, to demand what is needful for the work, both from the
provincial governors and from the Prætorian Præfect. For they have
received instructions to be most diligent in obedience to your
Holiness’s orders. God preserve you, beloved brother.” A copy of this
charge was transmitted throughout all the provinces to the bishops of
the several churches: the provincial governors received directions
accordingly, and the imperial statute was speedily carried into effect.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xlvi-p5"></span> \[Licinius, thus designated for the
subtlety of his character.—*Bag.*\] More probably for his wickedness,
and perhaps with thought of the “dragon” of the Book of Revelation. The
word is <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.xlvi-p5.1"></span>δρ€κων</span>, not <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.vi.ii.xlvi-p5.2"></span>ὄ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.vi.ii.xlvi-p5.3"></span>φις</span>. It is the
latter which is used in the LXX, where the English version speaks of the
serpent as the “subtlest.” For historical and symbolical use of the
words, compare Fergusson, *Tree and Serpent Worship* (Lond., 1874), and
Conway, *Demonology and Devil Lore* (N.Y., 1879, 2 v.).
