<span id="iv.vi.i.xxxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.xxxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXVII</span>.—*Defeat of
Maxentius’s Armies in Italy.*

<span id="iv.vi.i.xxxvii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.xxxvii-p2.1"></span>Constantine</span>, however, filled with
compassion on account of all these miseries, began to arm himself with
all warlike preparation against the tyranny. Assuming therefore the
Supreme God as his patron, and invoking His Christ to be his preserver
and aid, and setting the victorious trophy, the salutary symbol, in
front of his soldiers and body-guard, he marched with his whole forces,
trying to obtain again for the Romans the freedom they had inherited
from their ancestors.

<span id="iv.vi.i.xxxvii-p3"></span>And whereas, Maxentius, trusting
more in his magic arts than in the affection of his subjects, dared not
even advance outside the city gates, <span
id="fr_3122"></span>[3123](#fn_3122.md) but had guarded every place and
district and city subject to his tyranny, with large bodies of
soldiers, <span id="fr_3123"></span>[3124](#fn_3123.md) the emperor,
confiding in the help of God, advanced against the first and second and
third divisions of the tyrant’s forces, defeated them all with ease at
the first assault, <span id="fr_3124"></span>[3125](#fn_3124.md) and made
his way into the very interior of Italy.

<span id="iv.vi.i.xxxvii-p5"></span> *Bag.*adds “and numberless
ambuscades,” following *Valesius* and *1709.* The word so rendered is
the word for “companies of soldiers.” The rather awkward “multitude of
heavy-armed soldiers and myriads of companies of soldiers” may be
rendered as above, although “larger bodies of soldiers and limitless
supplies” suggested by the translation is perhaps the real meaning. He
had both “men and means.”
