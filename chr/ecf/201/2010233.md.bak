<span id="iii.xii.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xii.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XV.—</span>*The Martyrdom of
Marinus at Cæsarea.*

<span id="iii.xii.xvi-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xii.xvi-p2.1"></span>At</span> this time, when the peace of the
churches had been everywhere <span id="fr_2287"></span>[2288](#fn_2287.md)
restored, Marinus in Cæsarea in Palestine, who was honored for his
military deeds, and illustrious by virtue of family and wealth, was
beheaded for his testimony to Christ, on the following account.

<span id="iii.xii.xvi-p4"></span>2. The vine-branch <span
id="fr_2288"></span>[2289](#fn_2288.md) is a certain mark of honor among
the Romans, and those who obtain it become, they say, centurions. A
place being vacated, the order of succession called Marinus to this
position. But when he was about to receive the honor, another person
came before the tribunal and claimed that it was not legal, according to
the ancient laws, for him to receive the Roman dignity, as he was a
Christian and did not sacrifice to the emperors; but that the office
belonged rather to him.

<span id="iii.xii.xvi-p6"></span>3. Thereupon the judge, whose name was
Achæus, <span id="fr_2289"></span>[2290](#fn_2289.md) being disturbed,
first asked what opinion Marinus held. And when he perceived that he
continually confessed himself a Christian, he gave him three hours for
reflection.

<span id="iii.xii.xvi-p8"></span>4. When he came out from the tribunal,
Theotecnus, <span id="fr_2290"></span>[2291](#fn_2290.md) the bishop there,
took him aside and conversed with him, and taking his hand led him into
the church. And standing with him within, in the sanctuary, he raised
his cloak a little, and pointed to the sword that hung by his side; and
at the same time he placed before him the Scripture of the divine
Gospels, and told him to choose which of the two he wished. And without
hesitation he reached forth his right hand, and took the divine
Scripture. “Hold fast then,” says Theotecnus to him, “hold fast to God,
and strengthened by him mayest thou obtain what thou hast chosen, and go
in peace.”

<span id="iii.xii.xvi-p10"></span>5. Immediately on his return the
herald cried out calling him to the tribunal, for the appointed time was
already completed. And standing before the tribunal, and manifesting
greater zeal for the faith, immediately, as he was, he was led away and
finished his course by death.

<span id="iii.xii.xvi-p3"></span> The martyrdom of Marinus after the
promulgation of Gallienus’ edict of toleration and after peace had been,
as Eusebius remarks, everywhere restored to the churches, has caused
historians some difficulty. It is maintained, however, by Tillemont and
others, and with especial force by Görres in the *Jahrbücher für prot.
Theol.,* 1877, p. 620 sq., that the martyrdom of Marinus took place
while the usurper Macrianus, who was exceedingly hostile to the
Christians, was still in power in the East, and at a time, therefore,
when the edicts of Gallienus could have no force there. This of course
explains the difficulty completely. The martyrdom then must have taken
place toward the beginning of Gallienus’ reign, for Macrianus was slain
as early as 262. Of the martyr Marinus we know only what Eusebius tells
us here.

a badge of office a vine-branch or vine-switch, which was called by the
Romans *Vitis.*

<span id="iii.xii.xvi-p7"></span> Achæus is an otherwise unknown person.
That he was governor of Palestine, as Valesius asserts, is apparently a
pure assumption, for the term used of him (<span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xii.xvi-p7.1"></span>δικαστής</span>) is quite indefinite.
