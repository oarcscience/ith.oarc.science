<span id="iv.vi.i.xliv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.xliv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLIV</span>.—*How he was present
at the Synods of Bishops.*

<span id="iv.vi.i.xliv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.xliv-p2.1"></span>Such</span>, then, was his general
character towards all. But he exercised a peculiar care over the church
of God: and whereas, in the several provinces there were some who
differed from each other in judgment, he, like some general bishop
constituted by God, convened synods of his ministers. Nor did he disdain
to be present and sit with them in their assembly, but bore a share in
their deliberations, ministering to all that pertained to the peace of
God. He took <span id="page_495">p. 495</span> <span
id="iv.vi.i.xliv-Page_495"></span>his seat, too, in the midst of them,
as an individual amongst many, dismissing his guards and soldiers, and
all whose duty it was to defend his person; but protected by the fear of
God, and surrounded by the guardianship of his faithful friends. Those
whom he saw inclined to a sound judgment, and exhibiting a calm and
conciliatory temper, received his high approbation, for he evidently
delighted in a general harmony of sentiment; while he regarded the
unyielding wills with aversion. <span

<span id="iv.vi.i.xliv-p3"></span> Constantine, like Eusebius himself,
would be a distinct “tolerationist” in modern theological controversy.
One may imagine that Eusebius entered into favor with Constantine in
this way. It commends itself to our feeling; but after all, the
unyielding Athanasius was a greater man than Eusebius.
