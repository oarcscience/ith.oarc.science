<span id="iii.xii.xxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xii.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIII.—</span>*The Reign of
Gallienus.*

<span id="iii.xii.xxiv-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xii.xxiv-p2.1"></span>But</span> there is nothing like hearing
his own words, which are as follows:

<span id="iii.xii.xxiv-p3"></span>“Then he, <span
id="fr_2325"></span>[2326](#fn_2325.md) having betrayed one of the emperors
that preceded him, and made war on the other, <span
id="fr_2326"></span>[2327](#fn_2326.md) perished with his whole family
speedily and utterly. But Gallienus was proclaimed and universally
acknowledged at once an old emperor and a new, being before them and
continuing after them.

<span id="iii.xii.xxiv-p6"></span>2. For according to the word spoken by
the prophet Isaiah, ‘Behold the things from the beginning have come to
pass, and new things shall now arise.’ <span
id="fr_2327"></span>[2328](#fn_2327.md) For as a cloud passing over the
sun’s rays and obscuring them for a little time hides it and appears in
its place; but when the cloud has passed by or is dissipated, the sun
which had risen before appears again; so Macrianus who put himself
forward and approached the existing empire of Gallienus, is not, since
he never was. But the other is just as he was.

<span id="iii.xii.xxiv-p8"></span>3. And his kingdom, as if it had cast
aside old age, and had been purified from the former wickedness, now
blossoms out more vigorously, and is seen and heard farther, and extends
in all directions.” <span id="fr_2328"></span>[2329](#fn_2328.md)

<span id="iii.xii.xxiv-p10"></span>4. He then indicates the time at
which he wrote this in the following words:

<span id="iii.xii.xxiv-p11"></span>“It occurs to me again to review the
days of the imperial years. For I perceive that those most impious men,
though they have been famous, yet in a short time have become nameless.
But the holier and more godly prince, <span
id="fr_2329"></span>[2330](#fn_2329.md) having <span id="page_308">p.
308</span> <span id="iii.xii.xxiv-Page_308"></span>passed the seventh
year, is now completing the ninth, <span
id="fr_2330"></span>[2331](#fn_2330.md) in which we shall keep the feast.”

<span id="iii.xii.xxiv-p5"></span> He is supposed to have betrayed
Valerian into the hands of the Persians, or at least, by his treachery,
to have brought about the result which took place, and after Valerian’s
capture he made war upon Gallienus, the latter’s son and successor. See
the note referred to just above.

id="iii.xii.xxiv-p8.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.xxiv-p9"></span> Dionysius is evidently somewhat
dazzled and blinded by the favor shown by Gallienus to the Christians.
For we know from the profane historians of this period that the reign of
Gallienus was one of the darkest in all the history of the Roman Empire,
on account of the numerous disasters which came upon the empire, and the
internal disturbances and calamities it was called upon to endure.

<span id="fn_2329"></span>[307:2330](2010241.htm#fr_2329.md) <span
id="iii.xii.xxiv-p11.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.xxiv-p12"></span> Gallienus is known to us as one of
the most abandoned and profligate of emperors, though he was not without
ability and courage which he displayed occasionally. Dionysius’ words at
this point are not surprising, for the public benefits conferred by
Gallienus upon the Christians would far outweigh his private vices in
the minds of those who had suffered from the persecutions of his
predecessors.

<span id="fn_2330"></span>[308:2331](2010241.htm#fr_2330.md) <span
id="iii.xii.xxiv-p12.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.xxiv-p13"></span> The peculiar form of reckoning
employed here (the mention of the seventh and then the ninth year) has
caused considerable perplexity. Stroth thinks that “Dionysius speaks
here of the time when Gallienus actually ruled in Egypt. For Macrianus
had ruled there for a year, and during that time the authority of
Gallienus in that country had been interrupted.” The view of Pearson,
however, seems to me better. He remarks: “Whoever expressed himself
thus, that one after his seven years was passing his ninth year? This
*septennium* (<span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xii.xxiv-p13.1"></span>ἑ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xii.xxiv-p13.2"></span>πταετηρίς</span>) must designate
something peculiar and different from the time following. It is
therefore the septennium of imperial power which he had held along with
his father. In the eighth year of that empire \[the father, Valerian
being in captivity in Persia\], Macrianus possessed himself of the
imperial honor especially in Egypt. After his assumption of the purple,
however, Gallienus had still much authority in Egypt. At length in the
ninth year of Gallienus, i.e. in 261, Macrianus, the father and the two
sons being slain, the sovereignty of Gallienus was recognized also among
the Egyptians.” “The ninth year of Gallienus, moreover, began about
midsummer of this year; and the time at which this letter was written by
Dionysius, as Eusebius observes, may be gathered from that, and falls
consequently before the Paschal season of 262 <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xii.xxiv-p13.3"></span>a.d.</span>” See also chap. 1, note 3,
above.
