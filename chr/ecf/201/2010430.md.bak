id="iv.vi.i.xlv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLV</span>.—*His Forbearance with
Unreasonable Men.*

<span id="iv.vi.i.xlv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.xlv-p2.1"></span>Moreover</span> he endured with patience
some who were exasperated against himself, directing them in mild and
gentle terms to control themselves, and not be turbulent. And some of
these respected his admonitions, and desisted; but as to those who
proved incapable of sound judgment, he left them entirely at the
disposal of God, and never himself desired harsh measures against any
one. Hence it naturally happened that the disaffected in Africa reached
such a pitch of violence as even to venture on overt acts of
audacity; <span id="fr_3143"></span>[3144](#fn_3143.md) some evil spirit,
as it seems probable, being jealous of the present great prosperity, and
impelling these men to atrocious deeds, that he might excite the
emperor’s anger against them. He gained nothing, however, by this
malicious conduct; for the emperor laughed at these proceedings, and
declared their origin to be from the evil one; inasmuch as these were
not the actions of sober persons, but of lunatics or demoniacs; who
should be pitied rather than punished; since to punish madmen is as
great folly as to sympathize with their condition is supreme
philanthropy. <span id="fr_3144"></span>[3145](#fn_3144.md)

<span id="iv.vi.i.xlv-p4"></span> \[This passage in the text is
defective or corrupt.—*Bag.*\] What is given is substantially the
conventional translation of *Valesius, Heinichen, Molzberger,* and with
some variation, *1709* and *Bag.* It is founded, however, on a
conjectural reading, and reluctating against this, a suggestion may be
hazarded—“an excessive philanthropy for the folly of the insane, even to
the point of sympathy for them.”
