<span id="iii.xi.xliv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xi.xliv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLIV</span>.—*Dionysius’ Account of
Serapion.*

<span id="iii.xi.xliv-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xi.xliv-p2.1"></span>To</span> this same Fabius, who seemed to
lean somewhat toward this schism, <span
id="fr_2134"></span>[2135](#fn_2134) Dionysius of Alexandria also wrote
an epistle. <span id="fr_2135"></span>[2136](#fn_2135) He writes in this
many other things concerning repentance, and relates the conflicts of
those who had lately suffered martyrdom at Alexandria. After the other
account he mentions a certain wonderful fact, which deserves a place in
this work. It is as follows:

<span id="iii.xi.xliv-p5"></span>2. “I will give thee this one example
which occurred among us. There was with us a certain Serapion, <span
id="fr_2136"></span>[2137](#fn_2136) an aged believer who had lived for
a long time blamelessly, but had fallen in the trial. He besought often,
but no one gave heed to him, because he had sacrificed. But he became
sick, and for three successive days continued speechless and senseless.

<span id="iii.xi.xliv-p7"></span>3. Having recovered somewhat on the
fourth day he sent for his daughter’s son, and said, How long do you
detain me, my child? I beseech you, make haste, and absolve me speedily.
Call one of the presbyters to me. And when he had said this, he became
again speechless. And the boy ran to the presbyter. But it was night and
he was sick, and therefore unable to come.

<span id="iii.xi.xliv-p8"></span>4. But as I had commanded that persons
at the point of death, if they requested it, and especially if they had
asked for it previously, should receive remission, that they might
depart with a good hope, he gave the boy a small portion of the
eucharist, telling him to soak <span
id="fr_2137"></span>[2138](#fn_2137) it and let the drops fall into the
old man’s mouth. <span id="fr_2138"></span>[2139](#fn_2138)

<span id="iii.xi.xliv-p11"></span>5. The boy returned with it, and as he
drew near, before he entered, Serapion again arousing, said, ‘Thou art
come, my child, and the presbyter could not come; but do quickly what he
directed, and let me depart.’ Then the boy soaked it and dropped it into
his mouth. And when he had swallowed a little, immediately he gave up
the ghost.

<span id="iii.xi.xliv-p12"></span>6. Is it not evident that he was
preserved and his life continued till he was absolved, and, his sin
having been blotted out, he could be acknowledged <span
id="fr_2139"></span>[2140](#fn_2139) for the many good deeds which he
had done?”

<span id="iii.xi.xliv-p14"></span>Dionysius relates these things.

id="iii.xi.xliv-p3.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xi.xliv-p4"></span> This epistle, as we may gather from
the description of its contents in the next sentence, is without doubt
the same from which Eusebius has quoted at such length in chaps. 41 and
42. Upon the date and purpose of it, see chap. 41, note 1. We possess
only the fragments quoted by Eusebius in these three chapters.

<span id="fn_2136"></span>[290:2137](2010214.htm#fr_2136) <span
id="iii.xi.xliv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xi.xliv-p6"></span> Of this Serapion we know only what is
told us in this chapter.

<span id="fn_2137"></span>[290:2138](2010214.htm#fr_2137) <span

<span id="iii.xi.xliv-p9"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xi.xliv-p9.1"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xi.xliv-p9.2"></span>ποβρέξαι</span>. This is translated by
Crusè and by Salmond (in the *Ante-Nicene Fathers,* VI. p. 101) “soak
(or steep) in water”; but the liquid is not specified in the text, and
it has consequently been thought by others that the bread was dipped in
the wine, as was commonly done in the celebration of the eucharist in
the Eastern Church (see Bingham’s *Ant.* Bk. XV.). But it must be
noticed that the bread was soaked not by the presbyter but by the boy,
and that too after his return home, where there can have been no
consecrated wine for eucharistic use, and there is no hint that wine was
given him for the purpose by the presbyter. It therefore seems probable
that the bread was soaked simply in water, and that the soaking was only
in order that the old man, in his enfeebled state, might be able to
receive the element in a liquid instead of in a solid form.

id="iii.xi.xliv-p13.1"></span>ὁ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xi.xliv-p13.2"></span>μολογηθῆναι</span>. The meaning is
apparently “acknowledged or confessed by Christ,” and Valesius is
doubtless correct in remarking that Dionysius was alluding to the words
of [Matt. x. 32](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#032)<span
id="iii.xi.xliv-p13.3"></span>.
