<span id="iv.vii.xix-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vii.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIX</span>.—*That this Prophecy
respecting our Saviour was not the Fiction of any Member of the
Christian Church, but the Testimony of the Erythræan Sibyl, whose Books
were translated into Latin by Cicero before the coming of Christ. Also
that Virgil makes mention of the same, and of the Birth of the Virgin’s
Child: though he spoke obscurely of this Mystery from Fear of the Ruling
Powers.*

<span id="iv.vii.xix-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vii.xix-p2.1"></span>Many</span>, however, who admit that the
Erythræan Sibyl was really a prophetess, yet refuse to credit this
prediction, and imagine that some one professing our faith, and not
unacquainted with the poetic art, was the composer of these verses. They
hold, in short, that they are a forgery, and alleged to be the
prophecies of the Sibyl on the ground of their containing useful moral
sentiments, tending to restrain licentiousness, and to lead man to a
life of sobriety and decorum. Truth, however, in this case is evident,
since the diligence of our countrymen <span
id="fr_3461"></span>[3462](#fn_3461.md) has made a careful computation of
the times; so that there is no room to suspect that this poem was
composed after the advent and condemnation of Christ, or that the
general report is false, that the verses were a prediction of the Sibyl
in an early age. For it is allowed that Cicero was acquainted with this
poem, which he translated into the Latin tongue, and incorporated with
his own works. <span id="fr_3462"></span>[3463](#fn_3462.md) This writer
was put to death during the ascendancy of Antony, who in his turn was
conquered by Augustus, whose reign lasted fifty-six years. Tiberius
succeeded, in whose age it was that the Saviour’s advent enlightened the
world, the mystery of our most holy religion began to prevail, and as it
were a new race of men commenced: of which, I suppose, the prince of
Latin poets thus speaks:

<span id="iv.vii.xix-p5"></span>Behold, a new, a heaven-born race
appears. <span id="fr_3463"></span>[3464](#fn_3463.md)

<span id="iv.vii.xix-p7"></span>And again, in another passage of the
Bucolics:

<span id="iv.vii.xix-p8"></span>Sicilian Muses, sound a loftier strain.

<span id="iv.vii.xix-p9"></span>What can be clearer than this? For he
adds,

<span id="iv.vii.xix-p10"></span>The voice of Cuma’s oracle is heard
again. <span id="fr_3464"></span>[3465](#fn_3464.md)

<span id="iv.vii.xix-p12"></span>Evidently referring to the Cumæan
Sibyl. Nor was even this enough: the poet goes further, as if
irresistibly impelled to bear his testimony. What then does he say?

<span id="iv.vii.xix-p13"></span>Behold! the circling years new
blessings bring:

<span id="iv.vii.xix-p14"></span>The virgin comes, with her the
long-desired king. <span id="fr_3465"></span>[3466](#fn_3465.md)

<span id="iv.vii.xix-p18"></span><span id="page_576">p. 576</span> <span
id="iv.vii.xix-Page_576"></span>Who, then, is the virgin who was to
come? Is it not she who was filled with, and with child of the Holy
Spirit? And why is it impossible that she who was with child of the Holy
Spirit should be, and ever continue to be a virgin? This king, too, will
return, and by his coming lighten the sorrows of the world. The poet
adds,

<span id="iv.vii.xix-p19"></span>Thou, chaste Lucina, greet the new-born
child,

<span id="iv.vii.xix-p20"></span>Beneath whose reign the iron offspring
ends,

<span id="iv.vii.xix-p21"></span>A golden progeny from heaven descends;

<span id="iv.vii.xix-p22"></span>His kingdom banished virtue shall
restore,

<span id="iv.vii.xix-p23"></span>And crime shall threat the guilty world
no more.

<span id="iv.vii.xix-p24"></span>We perceive that these words are spoken
plainly and at the same time darkly, by way of allegory. Those who
search deeply for the import of the words, are able to discern the
Divinity of Christ. But lest any of the powerful in the imperial city
might be able to accuse the poet of writing anything contrary to the
laws of the country, and subverting the religious sentiments which had
prevailed from ancient times, he intentionally obscures the truth. For
he was acquainted, as I believe, with that blessed mystery which gave to
our Lord the name of Saviour: <span id="fr_3466"></span>[3467](#fn_3466.md)
but, that he might avoid the severity of cruel men, he drew the thoughts
of his hearers to objects with which they were familiar, saying that
altars must be erected, temples raised, and sacrifices offered to the
new-born child. His concluding words also are adapted to the sentiments
of those who were accustomed to such a creed; for he says:

id="iv.vii.xix-p2.2"></span>

<span id="iv.vii.xix-p3"></span> “Our men,” i.e. Christians rather than
“countrymen.”

<span id="fn_3462"></span>[575:3463](2010681.htm#fr_3462.md) <span
id="iv.vii.xix-p3.1"></span>

<span id="iv.vii.xix-p4"></span> \[The passage in Cicero (*De
Divinatione,* Bk. II. ch. 54) clearly does not refer to *this* acrostic,
and contains in itself a plain denial of prophetic truth in the
Sibylline prediction (whatever it was) which the writer had in view.
“Non esse autem illud carmen furentis, cum ipsum poema declaret (est
enim magis artis et diligentiæ, quam incitationis et motus), tum verò
ea, quæ <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.vii.xix-p4.1"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.vii.xix-p4.2"></span>κροστιχὶς</span> dicitur, cum deinceps ex
primis versuum litteris aliquid connectitur, ut in quibusdam Cumanis, id
certe magis est attenti animi, quam furentis,” &c.—*Bag.*\]

<span id="fn_3463"></span>[575:3464](2010681.htm#fr_3463.md) <span
id="iv.vii.xix-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iv.vii.xix-p6"></span> This and following quotations are found
in the fourth eclogue of Virgil—the *Pollio.* The version of *Bag.* is
allowed to stand. If farther variety of rendering and interpretation is
desired, it can be found in charming profusion in the various English
translations of Virgil of which the few at hand give ample promise.
Those at hand are Ogilby, Lond., 1675, p. 41–49; Warton, Lond., 1763, p.
76–82; Trapp, Lond., 1755, p. 37–46; Kennedy, Lond., 1849, p. 25–29;
Wilstach, Bost., 1884, p. 154–161; Bowen, Lond., 1887, p. 24–28. Compare
Henley, *Observations on the Subject of the Fourth Eclogue,* etc.,
Lond., 1788. 8vo.

<span id="fn_3464"></span>[575:3465](2010681.htm#fr_3464.md) <span
id="iv.vii.xix-p10.1"></span>

<span id="iv.vii.xix-p11"></span> Here is variety indeed. *1711*
renders, “Last times are come Cumæa’s prophecy,”—whatever that may mean.
*Molz.* has “Now the voice of the famed oracle of Cumæ is dumb.”

<span id="fn_3465"></span>[575:3466](2010681.htm#fr_3465.md) <span
id="iv.vii.xix-p14.1"></span>

<span id="iv.vii.xix-p15"></span> Constantine takes large liberty with
the poet here in order to make him say what he would like to have had
him say. The latest translation at hand (Bowen) renders:

<span id="iv.vii.xix-p16"></span>“Now is the world’s grand cycle begun
once more from of old;

<span id="iv.vii.xix-p17"></span>Justice the Virgin comes, and the
Saturn Kingdom again.”

<span id="fn_3466"></span>[576:3467](2010681.htm#fr_3466.md) <span
id="iv.vii.xix-p24.1"></span>

<span id="iv.vii.xix-p25"></span> “The blessed and salutary mystery of
our Saviour.”—*1709.* “Mystery of salvation.”—*Molz.*
