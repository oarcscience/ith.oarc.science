at Noon on the Feast of Pentecost.*

<span id="iv.vi.iv.lxiv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.lxiv-p2.1"></span>All</span> these events occurred during a
most important festival, I mean the august and holy solemnity of
Pentecost, which is distinguished by a period of seven weeks, and sealed
with that one day on which the holy Scriptures attest, the ascension of
our common Saviour into heaven, and the descent of the Holy Spirit among
men. In the course of this feast the emperor received the privileges I
have described; and on the last day of all, which one might justly call
the feast of feasts, he was removed about mid-day to the presence of his
God, leaving his mortal remains to his fellow mortals, and carrying into
fellowship with God that part of his being which was capable of
understanding and loving him. <span id="fr_3361"></span>[3362](#fn_3361.md)
Such was the close of Constantine’s mortal life. Let us now attend to
the circumstances which followed this event.
