of the Great Might of our Saviour.*

<span id="iii.xii.xviii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xii.xviii-p2.1"></span>Among</span> these is also the following
wonder. At Cæsarea Philippi, which the Phœnicians call Paneas, <span
id="fr_2293"></span>[2294](#fn_2293) springs are shown at the foot of
the Mountain Panius, out of which the Jordan flows. They say that on a
certain feast day, a victim was thrown in, <span
id="fr_2294"></span>[2295](#fn_2294) and that through the power of the
demon it marvelously disappeared and that which happened was a famous
wonder to those who were present. Astyrius was once there when these
things were done, and seeing the multitude astonished at the affair, he
pitied their delusion; and looking up to heaven he supplicated the God
over all through Christ, that he would rebuke the demon who deceived the
people, and bring the men’s delusion to an end. And they say that when
he had prayed thus, immediately the sacrifice floated on the surface of
the fountain. And thus the miracle departed; and no wonder was ever
afterward performed at the place.

<span id="iii.xii.xviii-p3"></span> Cæsarea Philippi (to be
distinguished from Cæsarea, the chief city of Palestine, mentioned in
previous chapters) was originally called Paneas by the Greeks,—a name
which it retained even after the name Cæsarea Philippi had been given it
by Philip the Tetrarch, who enlarged and beautified it. The place, which
is now a small village, is called Banias by the Arabs. It lies at the
base of Mt. Hermon, and is noted for one of the principal sources of the
Jordan, which issues from springs beneath the rocks of Mt. Hermon at
this point. The spot is said to be remarkably beautiful. See Robinson’s
*Biblical Researches in Palestine,* Vol. III, p. 409 sq.

<span id="iii.xii.xviii-p4"></span> Valesius remarks that the heathen
were accustomed to throw victims into their sacred wells and fountains,
and that therefore Publicola asks Augustine, in Epistle 153, whether one
ought to drink from a fountain or well whither a portion of sacrifice
had been sent.
