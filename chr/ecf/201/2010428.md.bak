<span id="iv.vi.i.xliii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.xliii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLIII</span>.—*Constantine’s
Liberality to the Poor.*

<span id="iv.vi.i.xliii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.xliii-p2.1"></span>He</span> likewise distributed money
largely to those who were in need, and besides these showing himself
philanthropist and benefactor even to the heathen, who had no claim on
him; <span id="fr_3139"></span>[3140](#fn_3139.md) and even for the beggars
in the forum, miserable and shiftless, he provided, not with money only,
or necessary food, but also decent clothing. But in the case of those
who had once been prosperous, and had experienced a reverse of
circumstances, his aid was still more lavishly bestowed. On such
persons, in a truly royal spirit, he conferred magnificent benefactions;
giving grants of land to some, and honoring others with various
dignities. Orphans of the unfortunate he cared for as a father, while he
relieved the destitution of widows, and cared for them with special
solicitude. Nay, he even gave virgins, left unprotected by their
parents’ death, in marriage to wealthy men with whom he was personally
acquainted. But this he did after first bestowing on the brides such
portions as it was fitting they should bring to the communion of
marriage. <span id="fr_3140"></span>[3141](#fn_3140.md) In short, as the
sun, when he rises upon the earth, liberally imparts his rays of light
to all, so did Constantine, proceeding at early dawn from the imperial
palace, and rising as it were with the heavenly luminary, impart the
rays of his own beneficence to all who came into his presence. It was
scarcely possible to be near him without receiving some benefit, nor did
it ever happen that any who had expected to obtain his assistance were
disappointed in their hope. <span id="fr_3141"></span>[3142](#fn_3141.md)

<span id="iv.vi.i.xliii-p3"></span> So usually rendered literally, “to
those who came to him from without,” but it might rather mean
“foreigners.” His generosity included not only the worthy poor citizens,
but foreigners and beggars.

<span id="iv.vi.i.xliii-p4"></span> The word used is the <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.vi.i.xliii-p4.1"></span>κοινωνία</span>,
familiar in the doctrine of the “communion” or “fellowship” of the
saints. It has the notion of reciprocity and mutual sharing.

<span id="fn_3141"></span>[494:3142](2010428.htm#fr_3141.md) <span
id="iv.vi.i.xliii-p4.2"></span>

<span id="iv.vi.i.xliii-p5"></span> The popular proverb that at the end
of his life he was a spendthrift, as given by Victor, represents the
other side of this liberality. Compare Prolegomena, under *Character.*
