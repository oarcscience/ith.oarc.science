id="iv.vi.ii.lvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter LVI</span>.—*He prays that All may
be Christians, but compels None.*

<span id="iv.vi.ii.lvi-p2"></span>“<span class="c13"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.lvi-p2.1"></span>My</span> own desire is, for the common
good of the world and the advantage of all mankind, that thy people
should enjoy a life of peace and undisturbed concord. Let those,
therefore, who still delight in error, be made welcome to the same
degree of peace and tranquillity which they have who believe. For it may
be that this restoration of equal privileges to all will prevail to lead
them into the straight path. Let no one molest another, but let every
one do as his soul desires. Only let men of sound judgment be assured of
this, that those only can live a life of holiness and purity, whom thou
callest to a reli<span id="page_514">p. 514</span> <span
id="iv.vi.ii.lvi-Page_514"></span>ance on thy holy laws. With regard to
those who will hold themselves aloof from us, let them have, if they
please, their temples <span id="fr_3201"></span>[3202](#fn_3201.md) of
lies: *we* have the glorious edifice of thy truth, which thou hast given
us as our native home. <span id="fr_3202"></span>[3203](#fn_3202.md) We
pray, however, that they too may receive the same blessing, and thus
experience that heartfelt joy which unity of sentiment inspires.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.lvi-p4"></span> \[<span class="Greek"><span

id="iv.vi.ii.lvi-p4.2"></span>Ονπερ κατὰ φύσιν δέδωκας</span>. The
clause is thus rendered by Valesius: “Nos splendidissimam domum
veritatis tuæ, quam nascentibus nobis donasti, retinemus.” This seems
almost as unintelligible as the original. The translation above
attempted yields, perhaps, a sense not inconsistent with the general
scope of the passage.—*Bag.*\] *1709* renders “according to nature.”
Molzberger has “through no merit on our part.” Stroth renders
“characteristically” or “as our own natural possession” (i.e.
eigenthümlich), and is confirmed by Heinichen, while Christophorson has
“natura” and Portesius “a natura.” The last is the best *translation*
“by nature.” As a matter of *interpretation* Bagster is probably wrong
and Stroth substantially right. Whether Constantine had the Epistle to
the Romans in mind or not, he had the same thought as Paul that men “by
nature” have the “truth of God,” but exchange this for a lie ([Rom.
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#025.md), [Rom.
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#014.md), [Rom.
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#021.md),

25](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#025.md)<span
id="iv.vi.ii.lvi-p4.4"></span>; ii. 14; cf. xi. 21 and 24). This
suggests, however, another possible meaning, that the truth is known
“through the things that are made” (<span

20](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#020.md)<span
