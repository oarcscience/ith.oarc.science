<span id="iv.viii.i-p6"></span><span class="c10"><span

<span id="iv.viii.i-p7"></span>————————————

<span id="iv.viii.i-p8"></span>*Prologue to the Oration.* <span
id="fr_3493"></span>[3494](#fn_3493)

<span id="iv.viii.i-p11"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iv.viii.i-p11.1"></span>I come</span> not forward prepared with a
fictitious narrative, nor with elegance of language to captivate the
ear, desiring to charm my hearers as it were, with a siren’s voice; nor
shall I present the draught of pleasure in cups of gold decorated with
lovely flowers (I mean the graces of style) to those who are pleased
with such things. Rather would I follow the precepts of the wise, and
admonish all to avoid and turn aside from the beaten road, and keep
themselves from contact with the vulgar crowd.

<span id="iv.viii.i-p12"></span>2. I come, then, prepared to celebrate
our emperor’s praises in a newer strain; and, though the number be
infinite of those who desire to be my companions in my present task, I
am resolved to shun the common track of men, <span
id="fr_3494"></span>[3495](#fn_3494) and to pursue that untrodden path
which it is unlawful to enter on with unwashed feet. Let those who
admire a vulgar style, abounding in puerile subtleties, and who court a
pleasing and popular muse, essay, since pleasure is the object they have
in view, to charm the ears of men by a narrative of merely human merits.
Those, however who are initiated into the universal science, <span
id="fr_3495"></span>[3496](#fn_3495) and have attained to Divine as well
as human knowledge, and account the choice of the latter as the real
excellence, will prefer those virtues of the emperor which Heaven itself
approves, and his pious actions, to his merely human accomplishments;
and will leave to inferior encomiasts the task of celebrating his lesser
merits.

<span id="iv.viii.i-p15"></span>3. For since our emperor is gifted as
well with that sacred wisdom which has immediate reference to God, as
with the knowledge which concerns the interests of men; let those who
are competent to such a task describe his secular acquirements, great
and transcendent as they are, and fraught with advantage to mankind (for
all that characterizes the emperor is great and noble), yet still
inferior to his diviner qualifies, to those who stand without the sacred
precincts.

<span id="iv.viii.i-p16"></span>4. Let those, however, who are within
the sanctuary, and have access to its inmost and untrodden recesses,
close the doors against every profane ear, and unfold, as it were, the
secret mysteries of our emperor’s character to the initiated alone. And
let those who have purified their ears in the streams of piety, and
raised their thoughts on the soaring wing of the mind itself, join the
company which surrounds the Sovereign Lord of all, and learn in silence
the divine mysteries.

<span id="iv.viii.i-p17"></span>5. Meanwhile let the sacred oracles,
given, not by the spirit of divination (or rather let me say of madness
and folly), but by the inspiration of Divine truth, <span
id="fr_3496"></span>[3497](#fn_3496) be our instructors in these
mysteries; speaking to us of sovereignty, generally: of him who is the
Supreme Sovereign of all, and the heavenly array which surrounds the
Lord of all; of that exemplar of imperial power which <span
id="page_582">p. 582</span> <span id="iv.viii.i-Page_582"></span>is
before us, and that counterfeit coin: and, lastly, of the consequences
which result from both. With these oracles, then, to initiate us in the
knowledge of the sacred rites, let us essay, as follows, the
commencement of our divine mysteries.

id="iv.viii.i-p8.1"></span>

<span id="iv.viii.i-p9"></span> The conventional heading has been
retained. Literally it is “Tricennial oration of Eusebius, addressed to
the Emperor Constantine. Prologue to the praises addressed to
Constantine.”

<span id="iv.viii.i-p10"></span>The translation of this oration shows,
even more than that of the *Life* or Constantine’s *Oration,* a sympathy
on the part of the translator with the florid style of Eusebius, and,
trying as the style itself is, the success of *Bag.* in presenting the
spirit of the original with, on the whole, very considerable accuracy of
rendering has been a constant matter of surprise during the effort to
revise.

<span id="fn_3494"></span>[581:3495](2010690.htm#fr_3494) <span
id="iv.viii.i-p12.1"></span>

<span id="iv.viii.i-p13"></span> Cf. Hom. *Il.* 6. 202, tr. Bryant, 6.
263–4, “shunning every haunt of human-kind.”

<span id="fn_3495"></span>[581:3496](2010690.htm#fr_3495) <span
id="iv.viii.i-p13.1"></span>

<span id="iv.viii.i-p14"></span> Eusebius seems to use this phrase much
as the modern phrases “The final philosophy,” “The science of sciences,”
“The queen of sciences,” when applied to theology.

<span id="fn_3496"></span>[581:3497](2010690.htm#fr_3496) <span
id="iv.viii.i-p17.1"></span>

<span id="iv.viii.i-p18"></span> “Divine light.”
