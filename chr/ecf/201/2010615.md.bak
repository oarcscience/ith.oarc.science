id="iv.vi.iv.xxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIX</span>.—*Of Constantine’s
Discourses and Declamations.* <span id="fr_3326"></span>[3327](#fn_3326.md)

<span id="iv.vi.iv.xxix-p3"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.xxix-p3.1"></span>For</span> himself, he sometimes passed
sleepless nights in furnishing his mind with Divine knowledge: and much
of his time was spent in composing discourses, many of which he
delivered in public; for he conceived it to be incumbent on him to
govern his subjects by appealing to their reason, and to secure in all
respects a rational obedience to his authority. Hence he would sometimes
himself evoke an assembly, on which occasions vast multitudes attended,
in the hope of hearing an emperor sustain the part of a philosopher. And
if in the course of his speech any occasion offered of touching on
sacred topics, he immediately stood erect, and with a grave aspect and
subdued tone of voice seemed reverently to be initiating his auditors in
the mysteries of the Divine doctrine: and when they greeted him with
shouts of acclamation, he would direct them by his gestures to raise
their eyes to heaven, and reserve their admiration for the Supreme King
alone, and honor him with adoration and praise. He usually divided the
subjects of his address, first thoroughly exposing the error of
polytheism, and proving the superstition of the Gentiles to be mere
fraud, and a cloak for impiety. He then would assert the sole
sovereignty of God: passing thence to his Providence, both general and
particular. Proceeding next to the dispensation of salvation, he would
demonstrate its necessity, and adaptation to the nature of the case;
entering next in order on the doctrine of the Divine judgment. <span
id="fr_3327"></span>[3328](#fn_3327.md) And here especially he appealed
most powerfully to the consciences of his hearers, while he denounced
the rapacious and violent, and those who were slaves to an inordinate
thirst of gain. Nay, he caused some of his own acquaintance who were
present to feel the severe lash of his words, and to stand with downcast
eyes in the consciousness of guilt, while he testified against them in
the clearest and most impressive terms that they would have an account
to render of their deeds to God. He reminded them that God himself had
given him the empire of the world, portions of which he himself, acting
on the same Divine principle, had intrusted to their government; but
that all would in due time be alike summoned to give account of their
actions to the Supreme Sovereign of all. Such was his constant
testimony; <span id="page_548">p. 548</span> <span
id="iv.vi.iv.xxix-Page_548"></span>such his admonition and instruction.
And he himself both felt and uttered these sentiments in the genuine
confidence of faith: but his hearers were little disposed to learn, and
deaf to sound advice; receiving his words indeed with loud applause, but
induced by insatiable cupidity practically to disregard them.
