<span id="iii.xvi.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xvi.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter III</span>.—*The Dedications in
Every Place.*

<span id="iii.xvi.iii-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xvi.iii-p2.1"></span>After</span> this was seen the sight which
had been desired and prayed for by us all; feasts of dedication in the
cities and consecrations of the newly built houses of prayer took place,
bishops assembled, foreigners came together from abroad, mutual love was
exhibited between people and people, the members of Christ’s body were
united in complete harmony.

<span id="iii.xvi.iii-p3"></span>2. Then was fulfilled the prophetic
utterance which mystically foretold what was to take place: “Bone to
bone and joint to joint,” <span id="fr_2811"></span>[2812](#fn_2811.md) and
whatever was truly announced in enigmatic expressions in the inspired
passage.

<span id="iii.xvi.iii-p5"></span>3. And there was one energy of the
Divine Spirit pervading all the members, and one soul in all, and the
same eagerness of faith, and one hymn from all in praise of the Deity.
Yea, and perfect services were conducted by the prelates, the sacred
rites being solemnized, and the majestic institutions of the Church
observed, <span id="fr_2812"></span>[2813](#fn_2812.md) here with the
singing of psalms and with the reading of the words committed to us by
God, and there with the performance of divine and mystic services; and
the mysterious symbols of the Saviour’s passion were dispensed.

<span id="iii.xvi.iii-p7"></span>4. At the same time people of every
age, both male and female, with all the power of the mind gave honor
unto God, the author of their benefits, in prayers and thanksgiving,
with a joyful mind and soul. And every one of the bishops present, each
to the best of his ability, delivered panegyric orations, adding luster
to the assembly.

<span id="iii.xvi.iii-p6"></span> These sentences are excellent examples
of Eusebius’ rhetorical style, which marks the greater part of this
tenth book. My endeavor has been to adhere as closely as possible to the
original; and yet there are cases in which it is quite out of the
question to give a literal translation without violating all grammatical
laws, and in which the sense can be reproduced only by paraphrasing. The
present sentence runs ναὶ μὴν καὶ τῶν προηγουμένων ἐντελεῖς θρησκεῖαι,
ἱερουργίαι τε τῶν ἱερωμένων, καὶ θεοπρεπεῖς ἐκκλησίας θεσμοί.
