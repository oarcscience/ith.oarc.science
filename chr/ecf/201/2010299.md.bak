id="iii.xvi.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II.—</span>*The Restoration of the
Churches.*

<span id="iii.xvi.ii-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xvi.ii-p2.1"></span>All</span> men, then, were freed from the
oppression of the tyrants, and being released from the former ills, one
in one way and another in another acknowledged the defender of the pious
to be the only true God. And we especially who placed our hopes in the
Christ of God had unspeakable gladness, and a certain inspired joy
bloomed for all of us, when we saw every place which shortly before had
been desolated by the impieties of the tyrants reviving as if from a
long and death-fraught pestilence, and temples again rising from their
foundations to an immense height, and receiving a splendor far greater
than that of the old ones which had been destroyed.

<span id="iii.xvi.ii-p3"></span>2. But the supreme rulers also confirmed
to us still more extensively the munificence of God by repeated
ordinances in behalf of the Christians; and personal letters of the
emperor were sent to the bishops, with honors and gifts of money. It may
not be unfitting to insert these documents, translated from the Roman
into the Greek tongue, at the proper place in this book, <span
id="fr_2810"></span>[2811](#fn_2810.md) as in a sacred tablet, that they
may remain as a memorial to all who shall come after us.
