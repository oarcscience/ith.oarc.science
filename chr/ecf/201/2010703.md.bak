<span id="iv.viii.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.viii.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIII.</span>

<span id="iv.viii.xiv-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iv.viii.xiv-p2.1"></span>And</span> now let us proceed to explain
the reasons for which this mighty Word of God descended to dwell with
men. Our ignorant and foolish race, incapable of comprehending him who
is the Lord of heaven and earth, proceeding from his Father’s Deity as
from the supreme fountain, ever present throughout the world, and
evincing by the clearest proofs his providential care for the interests
of man; have ascribed the adorable title of Deity to the sun, and moon,
the heaven and the stars of heaven. Nor did they stop here, but deified
the earth itself, its products, and the various substances by which
animal life is sustained, and devised <span id="page_601">p. 601</span>
<span id="iv.viii.xiv-Page_601"></span>images of Ceres, of Proserpine,
of Bacchus, <span id="fr_3556"></span>[3557](#fn_3556.md) and many such as
these.

<span id="iv.viii.xiv-p4"></span>2. Nay, they shrank not from giving the
name of gods to the very conceptions of their own minds, and the speech
by which those conceptions are expressed; calling the mind itself
Minerva, and language Mercury, <span
id="fr_3557"></span>[3558](#fn_3557.md) and affixing the names of Mnemosyne
and the Muses to those faculties by means of which science is acquired.
Nor was even this enough: advancing still more rapidly in the career of
impiety and folly, they deified their own evil passions, which it
behooved them to regard with aversion, or restrain by the principles of
self-control. Their very lust and passion and impure disease of soul,
the members of the body which tempt to obscenity, and even the very
uncontrol <span id="fr_3558"></span>[3559](#fn_3558.md) in shameful
pleasure, they described under the titles of Cupid, Priapus,
Venus, <span id="fr_3559"></span>[3560](#fn_3559.md) and other kindred
terms.

<span id="iv.viii.xiv-p8"></span>3. Nor did they stop even here.
Degrading their thoughts of God to this corporeal and mortal life, they
deified their fellow-men, conferring the names of gods and heroes on
those who had experienced the common lot of all, and vainly imagining
that the Divine and imperishable Essence could frequent the tombs and
monuments of the dead. Nay, more than this: they paid divine honors to
animals of various species, and to the most noxious reptiles: they
felled trees, and excavated rocks; they provided themselves with brass,
and iron, and other metals, of which they fashioned resemblances of the
male and female human form, of beasts, and creeping things; and these
they made the objects of their worship.

<span id="iv.viii.xiv-p9"></span>4. Nor did this suffice. To the evil
spirits themselves which lurked within their statues, or lay concealed
in secret and dark recesses, eager to drink their libations, and inhale
the odor of their sacrifices, they ascribed the same divine honors. Once
more, they endeavored to secure the familiar aid of these spirits, and
the unseen powers which move through the tracts of air, by charms of
forbidden magic, and the compulsion of unhallowed songs and
incantations. Again, different nations have adopted different persons as
objects of their worship. The Greeks have rendered to Bacchus, Hercules,
Æsculapius, Apollo, and others who were mortal men, the titles of gods
and heroes. The Egyptians have deified Horus and Isis, Osiris, and other
mortals such as these. And thus they who boast of the wondrous skill
whereby they have discovered geometry, astronomy, and the science of
number, know not, wise as they are in their own conceit, nor understand
how to estimate the measure of the power of God, or calculate his
exceeding greatness above the nature of irrational and mortal beings.

<span id="iv.viii.xiv-p10"></span>5. Hence they shrank not from applying
the name of gods to the most hideous of the brute creation, to venomous
reptiles and savage beasts. The Phœnicians deified Melcatharus,
Usorus, <span id="fr_3560"></span>[3561](#fn_3560.md) and others; mere
mortals, and with little claim to honor: the Arabians, Dusaris <span
id="fr_3561"></span>[3562](#fn_3561.md) and Obodas: the Getæ, Zamolxis: the
Cicilians, Mopsus: and the Thebans, Amphiaraus: <span
id="fr_3562"></span>[3563](#fn_3562.md) in short, each nation has adopted
its own peculiar deities, differing in no respect from their
fellow-mortals, being simply and truly men. Again, the Egyptians with
one consent, the Phœnicians, the Greeks, nay, every nation beneath the
sun, have united in worshiping the very parts and elements of the world,
and even the produce of the ground itself. And, which is most
surprising, though acknowledging the adulterous, unnatural, and
licentious crimes of their deities, they have not only filled every
city, and village, and district with temples, shrines, and statues in
their honor, but have followed their evil example to the ruin of their
own souls.

<span id="iv.viii.xiv-p14"></span>6. We hear of gods and the sons of
gods described by them as heroes and good genii, titles entirely opposed
to truth, honors utterly at variance with the qualifies they are
intended to exalt. It is as if one who desired to point out the sun and
the luminaries of heaven, instead of directing his gaze thitherward,
should grope with his hands on the ground, and search for the celestial
powers in the mud and mire. Even so mankind, deceived by their own folly
and the craft of evil spirits, have believed that the Divine and
spiritual Essence which is far above heaven and earth could be
compatible with the birth, the affections, and death, of mortal bodies
here below. To such a pitch of madness did they proceed, as to sacrifice
the dearest objects of their affection to their gods, regardless of all
natural ties, and urged by frenzied feeling to slay their only and best
beloved children.

<span id="iv.viii.xiv-p15"></span>7. For what can be a greater proof of
madness, than to offer human sacrifice, to pollute every city, and even
their own houses, with kindred blood? Do not the Greeks themselves
attest this, and is not all history filled with records of the same
impiety? The Phœnicians devoted their best beloved and only children as
an annual sacrifice to Saturn. The Rhodians, on the sixth day of the
month Metageitnion, <span id="fr_3563"></span>[3564](#fn_3563.md) offered
human victims to the same god. At Salamis, a man was pursued in <span
id="page_602">p. 602</span> <span id="iv.viii.xiv-Page_602"></span>the
temple of Minerva Agraulis and Diomede, compelled to run thrice round
the altar, afterwards pierced with a lance by the priest, and consumed
as a burnt offering on the blazing pile. In Egypt, human sacrifice was
most abundant. At Heliopolis three victims were daily offered to Juno,
for whom king Amoses, impressed with the atrocity of the practice,
commanded the substitution of an equal number of waxen figures. In
Chios, and again in Tenedos, a man was slain and offered up to Omadian
Bacchus. At Sparta they immolated human beings to Mars. In Crete they
did likewise, offering human sacrifices to Saturn. In Laodicea of Syria
a virgin was yearly slain in honor of Minerva, for whom a hart is now
the substitute. The Libyans and Carthaginians appeased their gods with
human victims. The Dumateni of Arabia buried a boy annually beneath the
altar. History informs us that the Greeks without exception, the
Thracians also, and Scythians, were accustomed to human sacrifice before
they marched forth to battle. The Athenians record the immolation of the
virgin children of Leus, <span id="fr_3564"></span>[3565](#fn_3564.md) and
the daughter of Erechtheus. <span id="fr_3565"></span>[3566](#fn_3565.md)
Who knows not that at this day a human victim is offered in Rome itself
at the festival of Jupiter Latiaris?

<span id="iv.viii.xiv-p19"></span>8. And these facts are confirmed by
the testimony of the most approved philosophers. Diodorus, the
epitomizer of libraries, <span id="fr_3566"></span>[3567](#fn_3566.md)
affirms that two hundred of the noblest youths were sacrificed to Saturn
by the Libyan people, and that three hundred more were voluntarily
offered by their own parents. Dionysius, the compiler of Roman
history, <span id="fr_3567"></span>[3568](#fn_3567.md) expressly says that
Jupiter and Apollo demanded human sacrifices of the so-called
Aborigines, in Italy. He relates that on this demand they offered a
proportion of all their produce to the gods; but that, because of their
refusal to slay human victims, they became involved in manifold
calamities, from which they could obtain no release until they had
decimated themselves, a sacrifice of life which proved the desolation of
their country. Such and so great were the evils which of old afflicted
the whole human race.

<span id="iv.viii.xiv-p22"></span>9. Nor was this the full extent of
their misery: they groaned beneath the pressure of other evils equally
numerous and irremediable. All nations, whether civilized or barbarous,
throughout the world, as if actuated by a demoniac frenzy, were infected
with sedition as with some fierce and terrible disease: insomuch that
the human family was irreconcilably divided against itself; the great
system of society was distracted and torn asunder; and in every corner
of the earth men stood opposed to each other, and strove with fierce
contention on questions of law and government.

<span id="iv.viii.xiv-p23"></span>10. Nay, more than this: with passions
aroused to fury, they engaged in mutual conflicts, so frequent that
their lives were passed as it were in uninterrupted warfare. None could
undertake a journey except as prepared to encounter an enemy; in the
very country and villages the rustics girded on the sword, provided
themselves with armor rather than with the implements of rural labor,
and deemed it noble exploit to plunder and enslave any who belonged to a
neighboring state.

<span id="iv.viii.xiv-p24"></span>11. Nay, more than this: from the
fables they had themselves devised respecting their own deities, they
deduced occasions for a vile and abandoned life, and wrought the ruin of
body and soul by licentiousness of every kind. Not content with this,
they even overstepped the bounds which nature had defined, and together
committed incredible and nameless crimes, “men with men (in the words of
the sacred writer) working un-seemliness, and receiving in themselves
that recompense of their error which was due.”

<span id="iv.viii.xiv-p25"></span>12. Nor did they stop even here; but
perverted their natural thoughts of God, and denied that the course of
this world was directed by his providential care, ascribing the
existence and constitution of all things to the blind operation of
chance, or the necessity of fate.

<span id="iv.viii.xiv-p26"></span>13. Once more: believing that soul and
body were alike dissolved by death, they led a brutish life, unworthy of
the name: careless of the nature or existence of the soul, they dreaded
not the tribunal of Divine justice, expected no reward of virtue, nor
thought of chastisement as the penalty of an evil life.

<span id="iv.viii.xiv-p27"></span>14. Hence it was that whole nations, a
prey to wickedness in all its forms, were wasted by the effects of their
own brutality: some living in the practice of most vile and lawless
incest with mothers, others with sisters, and others again corrupting
their own daughters. Some were found who slew their confiding guests;
others who fed on human flesh; some strangled, and then feasted on,
their aged men; others threw them alive to dogs. The time would fail me
were I to attempt to describe the multifarious symptoms of the
inveterate malady which had asserted its dominion over the whole human
race.

<span id="iv.viii.xiv-p28"></span>15. Such, and numberless others like
these, were the prevailing evils, on account of which the gracious Word
of God, full of compassion for his human flock, had long since, by the
ministry of his prophets, and earlier still, as well as later, by that
of men distinguished by <span id="page_603">p. 603</span> <span
id="iv.viii.xiv-Page_603"></span>pious devotion to God, invited those
thus desperately afflicted to their own cure; and had, by means of laws,
exhortations, and doctrines of every kind, proclaimed to man the
principles and elements of true godliness. But when for mankind,
distracted and torn as I have said, not indeed by wolves and savage
beasts, but by ruthless and soul-destroying spirits of evil, human power
no longer sufficed, but a help was needed superior to that of man; then
it was that the Word of God, obedient to his all-gracious Father’s will,
at length himself appeared, and most willingly made his abode amongst
us.

<span id="iv.viii.xiv-p29"></span>16. The causes of his advent I have
already described, induced by which he condescended to the society of
man; not in his wonted form and manner, for he is incorporeal, and
present everywhere throughout the world, proving by his agency both in
heaven and earth the greatness of his almighty power, but in a character
new and hitherto unknown. Assuming a mortal body, he deigned to
associate and converse with men; desiring, through the medium of their
own likeness, to save our mortal race.
