<span id="iv.vi.i.xix-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIX</span>.—*Of his Son
Constantine, who in his Youth accompanied Diocletian into Palestine.*

<span id="iv.vi.i.xix-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.xix-p2.1"></span>The</span> latter had been with his
father’s imperial colleagues, <span id="fr_3088"></span>[3089](#fn_3088.md)
and had passed his life among them, as we have said, like God’s ancient
prophet. And even in the very earliest period of his youth he was judged
by them to be worthy of the highest honor. An instance of this we have
ourselves seen, when he passed through Palestine with the senior
emperor, <span id="fr_3089"></span>[3090](#fn_3089.md) at whose right hand
he stood, and commanded the admiration of all who beheld him by the
indications he gave even then of royal greatness. For no one was
comparable to him for grace and beauty of person, or height of stature;
and he so far surpassed his compeers in personal strength as to be a
terror to them. He was, however, even more conspicuous for the
excellence of his mental <span id="fr_3090"></span>[3091](#fn_3090.md)
qualities than for his superior physical endowments; being gifted in the
first place with a sound judgment, <span
id="fr_3091"></span>[3092](#fn_3091.md) and having also reaped the
advantages of a liberal education. He was <span id="page_488">p.
488</span> <span id="iv.vi.i.xix-Page_488"></span>also distinguished in
no ordinary degree both by natural intelligence and divinely imparted
wisdom.
