id="iv.vi.iii.l-p1.1"></span>Chapter L</span>.—*That he erected Churches
in Nicomedia, and in Other Cities.*

<span id="iv.vi.iii.l-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.l-p2.1"></span>Having</span> thus embellished the city
which bore his name, he next distinguished the capital of Bithynia <span
id="fr_3282"></span>[3283](#fn_3282) by the erection of a stately and
magnificent church, being desirous of raising in this city also, in
honor of his Saviour and at his own charges, a memorial of his victory
over his own enemies and the adversaries of God. He also decorated the
principal cities of the other provinces with sacred edifices of great
beauty; as, for example, in the case of that metropolis of the East
which derived its name from Antiochus, in which, as the head of that
portion of the empire, he consecrated to the service of God a church of
unparalleled size and beauty. The entire building was encompassed by an
enclosure of great extent, within which the church itself rose to a vast
elevation, being of an octagonal form, and surrounded on all sides by
<span id="page_533">p. 533</span> <span
id="iv.vi.iii.l-Page_533"></span>many chambers, courts, and upper and
lower apartments; the whole richly adorned with a profusion of gold,
brass, and other materials of the most costly kind.
