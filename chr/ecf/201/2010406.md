id="iv.vi.i.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXI</span>.—*Death of Constantius,
who leaves his Son Constantine Emperor.* <span
id="fr_3094"></span>[3095](#fn_3094.md)

<span id="iv.vi.i.xxi-p3"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.xxi-p3.1"></span>Immediately</span>, therefore, on his
escape from the plots which had been thus insidiously laid for him, he
made his way with all haste to his father, and arrived at length at the
very time that he was lying at the point of death. <span
id="fr_3095"></span>[3096](#fn_3095.md) As soon as Constantius saw his son
thus unexpectedly in his presence, he leaped from his couch, embraced
him tenderly, and, declaring that the only anxiety which had troubled
him in the prospect of death, namely, that caused by the absence of his
son, was now removed, he rendered thanks to God, saying that he now
thought death better than the longest life, <span
id="fr_3096"></span>[3097](#fn_3096.md) and at once completed the
arrangement of his private affairs. Then, taking a final leave of the
circle of sons and daughters by whom he was surrounded, in his own
palace, and on the imperial couch, he bequeathed the empire, according
to the law of nature, <span id="fr_3097"></span>[3098](#fn_3097.md) to his
eldest son, and breathed his last.

<span id="iv.vi.i.xxi-p2"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.vi.i.xxi-p2.1"></span>Βασιλεύς</span>. The writer of the chapter
headings uses this word here and Augustus in the following chapter, but
it does not seem to mean technically “Cæsar,” and so the rendering
emperor is retained.

<span id="iv.vi.i.xxi-p4"></span> This seems to imply that Constantine
reached him only after he was sick in bed, i.e. at York in Britain; but
other accounts make it probable that he joined him at Boulogne before he
sailed on this last expedition to Britain. Compare Prolegomena.

<span id="fn_3096"></span>[488:3097](2010406.htm#fr_3096.md) <span

<span id="iv.vi.i.xxi-p5"></span> Literally, “than immortality \[on
earth\].”

<span id="fn_3097"></span>[488:3098](2010406.htm#fr_3097.md) <span
id="iv.vi.i.xxi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iv.vi.i.xxi-p6"></span> It will hardly be agreed that imperial
succession is a law of nature anyway. Rather, “the succession \[where it
exists\] is established by the express will or the tacit consent of the
nation,” and the “pretended proprietary right…is a chimera” (Vattell,
*Law of Nations,* Phila., 1867, p. 24, 25). That primogeniture is a
natural law has been often urged, but it seems to be simply the law of
first come first served. The English custom of primogeniture is said to
have risen from the fact that in feudal times the eldest son was the one
who, at the time of the father’s death, was of an age to meet the duties
of feudal tenure (compare Kent, *Commentaries,* Boston, 1867, v. 4, p.
420, 421). This is precisely the fact respecting Constantine. His
several brothers were all too young to be thought of.
