foregoing writers, a certain very elegant discourse is extant, which was
written by him against some brethren that had gone over to the heresy of
the so-called Encratites, <span id="fr_1321"></span>[1322](#fn_1321.md)
which had recently sprung up, and which introduced a strange and
pernicious error. It is said that Tatian was the author of this false
doctrine.

<span id="iii.ix.xxviii-p3"></span> Of this Musanus, we know only what
Eusebius tells us here, for Jerome (*de vir. ill.* 31) and Theodoret
(*Hær. Fab.* I. 21) simply repeat the account of Eusebius. It is clear
from Eusebius’ language, that he had not himself seen this work of
Musanus; he had simply heard of it. Here, and in chap. 21, Eusebius
assigns the activity of Musanus to the reign of Marcus Aurelius, making
him a contemporary of Melito, Apolinarius, Irenæus, &c. But in the
*Chron.* he is put much later. The Armenian version, under the year of
Abr. 2220 (the eleventh year of Septimius), has the entry *Musanus
noster scriptor cognoscebatur.* Jerome, under the same year (2220 of
Abr., but twelfth year of Severus) has *Musanus nostræ filosofiæ
scriptor agnoscitur;* while Syncellus, under the year of Abr. 2231
(fourth year of Caracalla) has <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.ix.xxviii-p3.1"></span>Μουσιανὸς ἐκκλησιαστικὸς συγγραφευς
ἐγνωρίζετο</span>. All of them, therefore, speak of Musanus (or
Musianus) as a writer, but do not specify any of his works. The dates in
the *Chron.* (whichever be taken as original) and in the *History* are
not mutually exclusive; at the same time it is clear that Eusebius was
not working upon the same information in the two cases. We have no means
of testing the correctness of either statement.
