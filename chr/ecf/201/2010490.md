<span id="iv.vi.ii.xlv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.xlv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLV</span>.—*Statutes which
forbade Sacrifice, and enjoined the Building of Churches.*

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xlv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.xlv-p2.1"></span>Soon</span> after this, two laws were
promulgated about the same time; one of which was intended to restrain
the idolatrous abominations which in time past had been practiced in
every city and country; and it provided that no one should erect images,
or practice divination and other false and foolish arts, or offer
sacrifice in any way. <span id="fr_3191"></span>[3192](#fn_3191) The
other statute commanded the heightening of the oratories, and the
enlargement in length and breadth of the churches of God; as though it
were expected that, now the madness of polytheism was wholly removed,
pretty nearly all mankind would henceforth attach themselves to the
service of God. His own personal piety induced the emperor to devise and
write these instructions to the governors of the several provinces: and
the law farther admonished them not to spare the expenditure of money,
but to draw supplies from the imperial treasury itself. Similar
instructions were written also to the bishops of the several churches;
and the emperor was pleased to transmit the same to myself, being the
first letter which he personally addressed to me.
