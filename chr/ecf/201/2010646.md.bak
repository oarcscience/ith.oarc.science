<span id="iv.vi.iv.lx-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.lx-p1.1"></span>Chapter LX</span>.—*He also erected his own
Sepulchral Monument in this Church.*

<span id="iv.vi.iv.lx-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.lx-p2.1"></span>All</span> these edifices the emperor
consecrated with the desire of perpetuating the memory of the apostles
of our Saviour. He had, however, another object in erecting this
building: an object at first unknown, but which afterwards became
evident to all. He had in fact made choice of this spot in the prospect
of his own death, anticipating with extraordinary fervor of faith that
his body would share their title with the apostles themselves, and that
he should thus even after death become the subject, with them, of the
devotions which should be performed to their honor in this place. He
accordingly caused twelve coffins to be set up in this church, like
sacred pillars in honor and memory of the apostolic number, in the
center of which his own was placed, having six of theirs on either side
of it. Thus, as I said, he had provided with prudent foresight an
honorable resting-place for his body after death, and, having long
before secretly formed this resolution, he now consecrated this church
to the apostles, believing that this tribute to their memory would be of
no small advantage to his own soul. Nor did God disappoint him of that
which he so ardently expected and desired. For after he had completed
the first services of the feast of Easter, and had passed this sacred
day of our Lord in a manner which made it an occasion of joy and
gladness to himself and to all; the God through whose aid he performed
all these acts, and whose zealous servant he continued to be even to the
end of life, was pleased at a happy time to translate him to a better
life.
