with Innumerable Evils, commenced the Last War Against the Romans.*

<span id="iii.vii.xxvii-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.vii.xxvii-p2.1"></span>Josephus</span> again, after relating
many things in connection with the calamity which came upon the whole
Jewish nation, records, <span id="fr_556"></span>[557](#fn_556.md) in
addition to many other circumstances, that a great many <span
id="fr_557"></span>[558](#fn_557.md) of the most honorable among the Jews
were scourged in Jerusalem itself and then crucified by Florus. <span
id="fr_558"></span>[559](#fn_558.md) It happened that he was procurator of
Judea when the war began to be kindled, in the twelfth year of
Nero. <span id="fr_559"></span>[560](#fn_559.md)

<span id="iii.vii.xxvii-p7"></span><span id="page_131">p. 131</span>
<span id="iii.vii.xxvii-Page_131"></span>2. Josephus says <span
id="fr_560"></span>[561](#fn_560.md) that at that time a terrible commotion
was stirred up throughout all Syria in consequence of the revolt of the
Jews, and that everywhere the latter were destroyed without mercy, like
enemies, by the inhabitants of the cities, “so that one could see cities
filled with unburied corpses, and the dead bodies of the aged scattered
about with the bodies of infants, and women without even a covering for
their nakedness, and the whole province full of indescribable
calamities, while the dread of those things that were threatened was
greater than the sufferings themselves which they anywhere
endured.” <span id="fr_561"></span>[562](#fn_561.md) Such is the account of
Josephus; and such was the condition of the Jews at that time.

<span id="iii.vii.xxvii-p3"></span> Josephus, *B. J.* II. 14. 9. He
relates that Florus, in order to shield himself from the consequences of
his misrule and of his abominable extortions, endeavored to inflame the
Jews to rebel against Rome by acting still more cruelly toward them. As
a result many disturbances broke out, and many bitter things were said
against Florus, in consequence of which he proceeded to the severe
measures referred to here by Eusebius.

<span id="iii.vii.xxvii-p4"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vii.xxvii-p4.1"></span>μυρίους ὅσους</span>. Josephus gives the
whole number of those that were destroyed, including women and children,
as about thirty-six hundred (no doubt a gross exaggeration, like most of
his figures). He does not state the number of noble Jews whom Florus
whipped and crucified. The “myriads” of Eusebius is an instance of the
exaggerated use of language which was common to his age, and which
almost invariably marks a period of decline. In many cases “myriads”
meant to Eusebius and his contemporaries twenty, or thirty, or even
less. Any number that seemed large under the circumstances was called a
“myriad.”

<span id="fn_558"></span>[130:559](2010068.htm#fr_558.md) <span
id="iii.vii.xxvii-p4.2"></span>

<span id="iii.vii.xxvii-p5"></span> Gessius Florus was a Greek whose
wife, Cleopatra, was a friend of the Empress Poppæa, through whose
influence he obtained his appointment (Jos. *Ant.* XX. 11. 1). He
succeeded Albinus in 64 <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.vii.xxvii-p5.1"></span>a.d.</span> (see above, chap. 23, note
35), and was universally hated as the most corrupt and unprincipled
governor Judea had ever endured. Josephus (*B. J.* II. 14. 2 sqq. and
*Ant.* XX. 11. 1) paints him in very black colors.

<span id="fn_559"></span>[130:560](2010068.htm#fr_559.md) <span
id="iii.vii.xxvii-p5.2"></span>

<span id="iii.vii.xxvii-p6"></span> Josephus (*B. J.* II. 14. 4) puts
the beginning of the war in the twelfth year of the reign of Nero (i.e.
<span class="c13"><span id="iii.vii.xxvii-p6.1"></span>a.d.</span> 66)
in the month of Artemision, corresponding to the month Iyar, the second
month of the Jewish year. According to Josephus (*Ant.* XX. 11. 1) this
was in the second year of Gessius Florus. The war began at this time by
repeated rebellious outbreaks among the Jews, who had been driven to
desperation by the unprincipled and tyrannical conduct of Florus,—though
Vespasian himself did not appear in Palestine until the spring of 67,
when he began his operations in Galilee.
