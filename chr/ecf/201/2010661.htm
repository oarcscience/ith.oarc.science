<p class="endnote"><a name="iv.vi.iv.lxxv-p3"></A> The sharp sarcasms of Julian&#146;s <i>C&aelig;sars</i> seem almost to have taken their text from this challenge. He marshals the great emperors before the gods, where each presents his claim to greatness. Constantine is greatly ridiculed, and yet to choose between Julian and Eusebius, if regard is had to Constantine&#146;s real effect on world history, Eusebius is the truer judge, and is at least not so far wrong that his superlative enthusiasm for his imperial friend cannot be readily pardoned.</p>
