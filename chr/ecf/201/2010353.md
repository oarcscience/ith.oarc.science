<span id="iv.iii.ii.ii-Page_421"></span>§2. *Inherited Characteristics.*

<span id="iv.iii.ii.ii-p2"></span>The fact of the inheritance of
character, virtues or vices as the case may be, curiously recognized in
various nations and ancient philosophies (cf. Ribot. *Heredity,* N.Y.
1875, p. 375–6), and even in the ten commandments, has received the
clearer exposition of modern science. In view of it, a scientific study
of character considers antecedent generations. Biography rests properly
on genealogy. Constantine’s father, Constantius Chlorus, was a man of
great mildness, self-possession, and philosophic virtue, just, and a
Neo-Platonist of the best type, a monotheist and philanthropist (cf.
Sinclair, in Smith & W. 1. 661–2). Constantine is said to have inherited
his father’s strength, courage, personal appearance (Eumen. *Paneg.* c.
4), piety (Pseud.-Leo, p. 83; cf. Const. and Euseb. in *V. C.* 2. 49),
and general virtues. The slur of Zosimus on the character of
Constantine’s mother seems to have been quite gratuitous. Her relation
to Constantius was in nowise incompatible with virtue, and the honor
afterwards paid her, along with the indisputable good early training of
Constantine which was with her, indicate a woman of unusual character.
The later enterprise and activity with the honors and responsibilities
given her show her to have been of very considerable energy and ability.
