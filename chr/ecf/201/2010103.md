<span id="iii.viii.xxxiv-p5"></span> In Bk. IV. chap. 1, Eusebius gives
eight years as the duration of Evarestus’ episcopate; but in his
*Chron.* he gives seven. Other catalogues differ widely, both as to the
time of his accession and the duration of his episcopate. The truth is,
as the monarchical episcopate was not yet existing in Rome, it is
useless to attempt to fix his dates, or those of any of the other
so-called bishops who lived before the second quarter of the second
century.
