<span id="iv.vi.ii.xxi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXI</span>.—*His Laws concerning
Martyrs, and concerning Ecclesiastical Property.*

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xxi-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.xxi-p2.1"></span>Such</span> were the benefits secured by
the emperor’s written mandates to the persons of those who had thus
suffered for the faith, and his laws made ample provision for their
property also.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xxi-p3"></span>With regard to those holy martyrs of
God who had laid down their lives in the confession of His name, he
directed that their estates should be enjoyed by their nearest kindred;
and, in default of any of these, that the right of inheritance should be
vested in the churches. Farther, whatever property had been consigned to
other parties from the treasury, whether in the way of sale or gift,
together with that retained in the treasury itself, the generous mandate
of the emperor directed should be restored to the original owners. Such
benefits did his bounty, thus widely diffused, confer on the Church of
God.
