id="iv.vi.iii.xliii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLIII</span>.—*A Farther Notice
of the Churches at Bethlehem.*

<span id="iv.vi.iii.xliii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span

two churches to the God whom she adored, one at the grotto which had
been the scene of the Saviour’s birth; the other on the mount of his
ascension. For <span id="page_531">p. 531</span> <span
id="iv.vi.iii.xliii-Page_531"></span>he who was “God with us” had
submitted to be born even in a cave <span
id="fr_3275"></span>[3276](#fn_3275.md) of the earth, and the place of his
nativity was called Bethlehem by the Hebrews. Accordingly the pious
empress honored with rare memorials the scene of her travail who bore
this heavenly child, and beautified the sacred cave with all possible
splendor. The emperor himself soon after testified his reverence for the
spot by princely offerings, and added to his mother’s magnificence by
costly presents of silver and gold, and embroidered hangings. And
farther, the mother of the emperor raised a stately structure on the
Mount of Olives also, in memory of his ascent to heaven who is the
Saviour of mankind, erecting a sacred church and temple on the very
summit of the mount. And indeed authentic history informs us that in
this very cave the Saviour imparted his secret revelations to his
disciples. <span id="fr_3276"></span>[3277](#fn_3276.md) And here also the
emperor testified his reverence for the King of kings, by diverse and
costly offerings. Thus did Helena Augusta, the pious mother of a pious
emperor, erect over the two mystic caverns these two noble and beautiful
monuments of devotion, worthy of everlasting remembrance, to the honor
of God her Saviour, and as proofs of her holy zeal, receiving from her
son the aid of his imperial power. Nor was it long ere this aged woman
reaped the due reward of her labors. After passing the whole period of
her life, even to declining age, in the greatest prosperity, and
exhibiting both in word and deed abundant fruits of obedience to the
divine precepts, and having enjoyed in consequence an easy and tranquil
existence, with unimpaired powers of body and mind, at length she
obtained from God an end befitting her pious course, and a recompense of
her good deeds even in this present life.

seems to have been characteristic of the age of Eusebius to invest the
more prominent circumstances connected with the Lord’s life on earth
with a degree of romance and mystery equally inconsistent with Scripture
and with probability. It is obvious that Scripture furnishes no
authority for the caves either of the nativity or ascension. See ch. 41,
