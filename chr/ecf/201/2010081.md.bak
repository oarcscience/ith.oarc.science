id="iii.viii.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII.—</span>*Vespasian commands
the Descendants of David to be sought.*

<span id="iii.viii.xii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.viii.xii-p2.1"></span>He</span> also relates that Vespasian
after the conquest of Jerusalem gave orders that all that belonged to
the lineage of David should be sought out, in order that none of the
royal race might be left among the Jews; and in consequence of this a
most terrible persecution again hung over the Jews. <span

<span id="iii.viii.xii-p3"></span> It is not certain that Eusebius
intends to give Hegesippus as his authority for the statements of this
chapter, inasmuch as he does not mention his name. He gives the account,
however, upon the authority of some one else, and not as a direct
historical statement, for the verb is in the infinitive, and it is much
more natural to supply <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.viii.xii-p3.1"></span>῾</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.viii.xii-p3.2"></span>Η</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.viii.xii-p3.3"></span>γήσιππος ἱστορεῖ</span>, the last words of
the preceding chapter, than to supply any other phrase, such as <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.viii.xii-p3.4"></span>λόγος κατέχει</span>,
which occurs two chapters earlier. The translators are divided as to the
words that are to be supplied, but it seems to me beyond doubt that this
account rests upon the same authority as that of the previous chapter.
There is in any case nothing at all unlikely in the report, as Vespasian
and his successors kept a very close watch upon the Jews, and this would
have been a very natural method of endeavoring to prevent future
revolutions. The same course was pursued also by Domitian; see below,
chaps. 19 and 20. We hear from no other source of a persecution raised
against the Jews by Vespasian, and we may therefore conclude that it
cannot have amounted to much, if indeed it deserves to be called a
persecution at all.
