<span id="iii.viii.ii-p3"></span> The actual order of the first three
so-called bishops of Rome is a greatly disputed matter. The oldest
tradition is that given by Irenæus (*Adv. Hær.* III. 3. 3) and followed
here by Eusebius, according to which the order was Linus, Anencletus,
Clement. Hippolytus gives a different order, in which he is followed by
many Fathers; and in addition to these two chief arrangements all
possible combinations of the three names, and all sorts of theories to
account for the difficulties and to reconcile the discrepancies in the
earlier lists, have been proposed. In the second chapter of the
so-called *Epistle of Clement to James* (a part of the Pseudo-Clementine
Literature prefixed to the *Homilies*) it is said that Clement was
ordained by Peter, and Salmon thinks that this caused Hippolytus to
change the order, putting Clement first. Gieseler (*Eccles. Hist.,* Eng.
Trans., I. p. 107, note 10) explains the disagreements in the various
traditions by supposing that the three were presbyters together at Rome,
and that later, in the endeavor to make out a complete list of bishops,
they were each successively elevated by tradition to the episcopal
chair. It is at least certain that Rome at that early date had no
monarchical bishop, and therefore the question as to the order of these
first three so-called bishops is not a question as to a fact, but simply
as to which is the oldest of various unfounded traditions. The Roman
Church gives the following order: Linus, Clement, Cletus, Anacletus,
following Hippolytus in making Cletus and Anacletus out of the single
Anencletus of the original tradition. The apocryphal martyrdoms of Peter
and Paul are falsely ascribed to Linus (see Tischendorf, *Acta Apost.
Apocr.* p. xix. sq.). Eusebius (chap. 13, below) says that Linus was
bishop for twelve years. In his *Chron.* (Armen.) he says fourteen
years, while Jerome says eleven. These dates are about as reliable as
the episcopal succession itself. We have no trustworthy information as
to the personal character and history of Linus. Upon the subjects
discussed in this note see especially Salmon’s articles, *Clemens
Romanus,* and *Linus,* in the *Dict. of Christ. Biog.*

The same identification is made by Irenæus, *Adv. Hær.* III. 3. 3, and
by Pseudo-Ignatius in the *Epistle to the Trallians* (longer version),
chap. 7.
