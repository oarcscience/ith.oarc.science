id="iv.vi.i.xxxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXV</span>.—*Massacre of the
Roman People by Maxentius.*

<span id="iv.vi.i.xxxv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.xxxv-p2.1"></span>All</span> men, therefore, both people and
magistrates, whether of high or low degree, trembled through fear of him
whose daring wickedness was such as I have described, and were oppressed
by his grievous tyranny. Nay, though they submitted quietly, and endured
this bitter servitude, still there was no escape from the tyrant’s
sanguinary cruelty. For at one time, on some trifling pretense, he
exposed the populace to be slaughtered by his own body-guard; and
countless multitudes of the Roman people were slain in the very midst of
the city by the lances and weapons, not of Scythians or barbarians, but
of their own fellow-citizens. And besides this, it is impossible to
calculate the number of senators whose blood was shed with a view to the
seizure of their respective estates, for at different times and on
various fictitious charges, multitudes of them suffered death.
