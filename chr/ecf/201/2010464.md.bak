Festivities.*

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xix-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span

removed, the sun once more shone brightly after the gloomy cloud of
tyrannic power. Each separate portion of the Roman dominion became
blended with the rest; the Eastern nations united with those of the
West, and the whole body of the Roman empire was graced as it were by
its head in the person of a single and supreme ruler, whose sole
authority pervaded the whole. Now too the bright rays of the light of
godliness gladdened the days of those who had heretofore been sitting in
darkness and the shadow of death. Past sorrows were no more remembered,
for all united in celebrating the praises of the victorious prince, and
avowed their recognition of his preserver as the only true God. Thus he
whose character shone with all the virtues of piety, the emperor <span
class="c13"><span id="iv.vi.ii.xix-p2.2"></span>Victor</span>, for he
had himself adopted this name as a most fitting appellation to express
the victory which God had granted him over all who hated or opposed
him, <span id="fr_3177"></span>[3178](#fn_3177.md) assumed the dominion of
the East, and thus singly governed the Roman empire, re-united, as in
former times, under one head. Thus, as he was the first to proclaim to
all the sole sovereignty of God, so he himself, as sole sovereign of the
Roman world, extended his authority over the whole human race. Every
apprehension of those evils under the pressure of which all had suffered
was now removed; men whose heads had drooped in sorrow now regarded each
other with smiling countenances, and looks expressive of their inward
joy. With processions and hymns of praise they first of all, as they
were told, ascribed the supreme sovereignty to God, as in truth the King
of kings; and then with continued acclamations rendered honor to the
victorious emperor, and the Cæsars, his most discreet and pious sons.
The former afflictions were forgotten, and all past impieties forgiven:
while with the enjoyment of present happiness was mingled the
expectation of continued blessings in the future.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xix-p3"></span> Like very many other things which
Eusebius tells of Constantine, that which was entirely customary with
other emperors as well as Constantine has the appearance of being
peculiar to him. Victor is a common title of various emperors.
