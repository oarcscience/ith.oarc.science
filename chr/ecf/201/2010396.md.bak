<span id="iv.vi.i.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI</span>.—*That his Present Object
is to record only the Pious Actions of Constantine.*

<span id="iv.vi.i.xi-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.xi-p2.1"></span>It</span> is my intention, therefore, to
pass over the greater part of the royal deeds of this thrice-blessed
prince; as, for example, his conflicts and engagements in the field, his
personal valor, his victories and successes against the enemy, and the
many triumphs he obtained: likewise his provisions for the interests of
individuals, his legislative enactments for the social advantage of his
subjects, and a multitude of other imperial labors which are fresh in
the memory of all; the design of my present undertaking being to speak
and write of those circumstances only which have reference to his
religious character.

<span id="iv.vi.i.xi-p3"></span>And since these are themselves of almost
infinite variety, I shall select from the facts <span id="page_485">p.
485</span> <span id="iv.vi.i.xi-Page_485"></span>which have come to my
knowledge such as are most suitable, and worthy of lasting record, and
endeavor to narrate them as briefly as possible. Henceforward, indeed,
there is a full and free opportunity for celebrating in every way the
praises of this truly blessed prince, which hitherto we have been unable
to do, on the ground that we are forbidden to judge any one blessed
before his death, <span id="fr_3073"></span>[3074](#fn_3073.md) because of
the uncertain vicissitudes of life. Let me implore then the help of God,
and may the inspiring aid of the heavenly Word be with me, while I
commence my history from the very earliest period of his life.

a man shall be known in his children.” Or, possibly, to the well-known
