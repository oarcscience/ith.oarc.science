Christians to Offices of Government, and forbade Gentiles in Such
Stations to offer Sacrifice.*

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xliv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.xliv-p2.1"></span>After</span> this the emperor continued
to address himself to matters of high importance, and first he sent
governors to the several provinces, mostly such as were devoted to the
saving faith; and if any appeared inclined to adhere to Gentile worship,
he forbade them to offer sacrifice. This law applied also to those who
surpassed the provincial governors in rank and dignity, <span

highest station, and held the authority of the Prætorian
Præfecture. <span id="fr_3190"></span>[3191](#fn_3190.md) If they were
Christians, they were free to act consistently with their profession; if
otherwise, the law required them to abstain from idolatrous sacrifices.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xliv-p4"></span> \[The power of the four Prætorian
Præfects in the time of Constantine is thus described by Gibbon: “1. The
Præfect of the East stretched his ample jurisdiction into the three
parts of the globe which were subject to the Romans, from the cataracts
of the Nile to the banks of the Phasis, and from the mountains of Thrace
to the frontiers of Persia. 2. The important provinces of Pannonia,
Dacia, Macedonia, and Greece once acknowledged the authority of the
Præfect of Illyricum. 3. The power of the Præfect of Italy was not
confined to the country from whence he derived his title; it extended
over the additional territory of Rhætia as far as the banks of the
Danube, over the dependent islands of the Mediterranean, and over that
part of the continent of Africa which lies between the confines of
Cyrene and those of Tingitania. 4. The Præfect of the Gauls comprehended
under that plural denomination the kindred provinces of Britain and
Spain, and his authority was obeyed from the wall of Antoninus to the
fort of Mount Atlas.”—*Decline and Fall,* chap. 17.— *Bag.*\]
