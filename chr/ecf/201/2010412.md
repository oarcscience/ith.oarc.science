<span id="iv.vi.i.xxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.xxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVII</span>.—*That after
reflecting on the Downfall of those who had worshiped Idols, he made
Choice of Christianity.*

<span id="iv.vi.i.xxvii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.xxvii-p2.1"></span>Being</span> convinced, however, that he
needed some more powerful aid than his military forces could afford him,
on account of the wicked and magical enchantments which were so
diligently practiced by the tyrant, <span
id="fr_3103"></span>[3104](#fn_3103) he sought Divine assistance,
deeming the possession of arms and a numerous soldiery of secondary
importance, but believing the co-operating power of Deity invincible and
not to be shaken. He considered, therefore, on what God he might rely
for protection and assistance. While engaged in this enquiry, the
thought occurred to him, that, of the many emperors who had preceded
him, those who had rested their hopes in a multitude of gods, and served
them with sacrifices and offerings, had in the first place been deceived
by flattering predictions, and oracles which promised them all
prosperity, and at last had met with an unhappy end, while not one of
their gods had stood by to warn them of the impending wrath of heaven;
while one alone who had pursued an entirely opposite course, who had
condemned their error, and honored the one Supreme God during his whole
life, had found him to be the Saviour and Protector of his empire, and
the Giver of every good thing. Reflecting on this, and well weighing the
fact that they who had trusted in many gods had also fallen by manifold
forms of death, without leaving behind them either family or offspring,
stock, name, or memorial among men: while the God of his father had
given to him, on the other hand, manifestations of his power and very
many tokens: and considering farther that those who had already taken
arms against the tyrant, and had marched to the battle-field under the
protection of a multitude of gods, had met with a dishonorable end (for
one of them <span id="fr_3104"></span>[3105](#fn_3104) had shamefully
retreated from the contest without a blow, and the other, <span
id="fr_3105"></span>[3106](#fn_3105) being slain in the midst of <span
id="page_490">p. 490</span> <span id="iv.vi.i.xxvii-Page_490"></span>his
own troops, became, as it were, the mere sport of death <span
id="fr_3106"></span>[3107](#fn_3106) ); reviewing, I say, all these
considerations, he judged it to be folly indeed to join in the idle
worship of those who were no gods, and, after such convincing evidence,
to err from the truth; and therefore felt it incumbent on him to honor
his father’s God alone.

<span id="iv.vi.i.xxvii-p6"></span> This last phrase has exercised the
ingenuity of translators greatly. This translation does well enough,
though one might hazard “was easily overcome by death,” or “was an easy
victim to death.”
