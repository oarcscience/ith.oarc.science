id="iv.vi.iv.lxxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter LXXI</span>.—*Sacred Service in
the Church of the Apostles on the Occasion of Constantine’s Funeral.*

<span id="iv.vi.iv.lxxi-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.lxxi-p2.1"></span>As</span> soon as \[Constantius\] had
withdrawn himself with the military train, the ministers of God came
forward, with the multitude and the whole congregation of the faithful,
and performed the rites of Divine worship with prayer. At the same time
the tribute of their praises was given to the character of this blessed
prince, whose body rested on a lofty and conspicuous monument, and the
whole multitude united with the priests of God in offering prayers for
his soul, not without tears,—nay, rather with much weeping; thus
performing an office consonant with the desires of the pious
deceased. <span id="fr_3362"></span>[3363](#fn_3362.md) In this respect
also the favor of God was manifested to his servant, in that he not only
bequeathed the succession of the empire to his own beloved sons, but
that the earthly tabernacle of his thrice blessed soul, according to his
own earnest wish, was permitted to share the monument of the apostles;
was associated with the honor of their name, and with that of the people
of God; was honored by the performance of the sacred ordinances and
mystic service; and enjoyed a participation in the prayers of the
saints. Thus, too, he continued to possess imperial power even after
death, controlling, as though with renovated life, a universal dominion,
and retaining in his own name, as Victor, Maximus, Augustus, the
sovereignty of the Roman world. <span
