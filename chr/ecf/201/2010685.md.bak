<span id="iv.vii.xxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vii.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIII</span>.—*Of Christian
Conduct. That God is pleased with those who lead a Life of Virtue: and
that we must expect a Judgment and Future Retribution.*

<span id="iv.vii.xxiii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vii.xxiii-p2.1"></span>Compare</span> our religion with your own.
Is <span id="page_579">p. 579</span> <span
id="iv.vii.xxiii-Page_579"></span>there not with us genuine concord, and
unwearied love of others? If we reprove a fault, is not our object to
admonish, not to destroy; our correction for safety, not for cruelty? Do
we not exercise, not only sincere faith towards God, but fidelity in the
relations of social life? Do we not pity the unfortunate? Is not ours a
life of simplicity which disdains to cover evil beneath the mask of
fraud and hypocrisy? Do we not acknowledge the true God, and his
undivided sovereignty? This is real godliness: this is religion sincere
and truly undefiled: this is the life of wisdom; and they who have it
are travelers, as it were, on a noble road which leads to eternal life.
For he who has entered on such a course, and keeps his soul pure from
the pollutions of the body, does not wholly die: rather may he be said
to complete the service appointed him by God, than to die. Again, he who
confesses allegiance to God is not easily overborne by insolence or
rage, but nobly stands under the pressure of necessity and the trial of
his constancy is as it were, a passport to the favor of God. For we
cannot doubt that the Deity is pleased with excellence in human conduct.
For it would be absurd indeed if the powerful and the humble alike
acknowledge gratitude to those from whose services they receive benefit,
and repay them by services in return, and yet that he who is supreme and
sovereign of all, nay, who is Good itself, should be negligent in this
respect. Rather does he follow us throughout the course of our lives, is
near us in every act of goodness, accepts, and at once rewards our
virtue and obedience; though he defers the full recompense to that
future period, when the actions of our lives shall pass under his review
and when those who are clear in that account shall receive the reward of
everlasting life, while the wicked shall be visited with the penalties
due to their crimes.
