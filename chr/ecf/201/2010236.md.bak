<span id="iii.xii.xix-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xii.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.—</span>*The Statue which the
Woman with an Issue of Blood erected.* <span
id="fr_2295"></span>[2296](#fn_2295.md)

<span id="iii.xii.xix-p3"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xii.xix-p3.1"></span>Since</span> I have mentioned this city I
do not think it proper to omit an account which is worthy of record for
posterity. For they say that the woman with an issue of blood, who, as
we learn from the sacred Gospel, <span
id="fr_2296"></span>[2297](#fn_2296.md) received from our Saviour
deliverance from her affliction, came from this place, and that her
house is shown in the city, and that remarkable memorials of the
kindness of the Saviour to her remain there.

<span id="iii.xii.xix-p5"></span>2. For there stands upon an elevated
stone, by the gates of her house, a brazen image of a woman kneeling,
with her hands stretched out, as if she were praying. Opposite this is
another upright image of a man, made of the same material, clothed
decently in a double cloak, and extending his hand toward the woman. At
his feet, beside the statue itself, <span
id="fr_2297"></span>[2298](#fn_2297.md) is a certain strange plant, which
climbs up to the hem of the brazen cloak, and is a remedy for all kinds
of diseases.

<span id="iii.xii.xix-p7"></span>3. They say that this statue is an
image of Jesus. It has remained to our day, so that we ourselves also
saw it when we were staying in the city.

<span id="iii.xii.xix-p8"></span>4. Nor is it strange that those of the
Gentiles who, of old, were benefited by our Saviour, should have done
such things, since we have learned also that the likenesses of his
apostles Paul and Peter, and of Christ himself, are preserved in
paintings, <span id="fr_2298"></span>[2299](#fn_2298.md) the ancients being
accustomed, as it is likely, according to a habit of the Gentiles, to
pay this kind of honor indiscriminately to those regarded by them as
deliverers.

<span id="iii.xii.xix-p2"></span> This account of the statue erected by
the woman with the issue of blood is repeated by many later writers, and
Sozomen (*H. E.* V. 21) and Philostorgius (*H. E.* VII. 3) inform us
that it was destroyed by the Emperor Julian. Gieseler remarks (*Eccles.
Hist.,* Harper’s ed. I. p. 70), “Judging by the analogy of many coins,
the memorial had been erected in honor of an emperor (probably Hadrian),
and falsely interpreted by the Christians, perhaps on account of a <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.xii.xix-p2.1"></span>σωτῆρι</span> or <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.xii.xix-p2.2"></span>θεῷ</span> appearing in
the inscription.” There can be no doubt of Eusebius’ honesty in the
matter, but no less doubt that the statue commemorated something quite
different from that which Christian tradition claimed. Upon this whole
chapter, see Heinichen’s Excursus, in Vol. III. p. 698 sq.

<span id="iii.xii.xix-p6"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xii.xix-p6.1"></span>οὗ παρὰ τοῖς ποσὶν ἐπὶ τῆς στήλης
αὐτῆς</span>. This is commonly translated “at his feet, *upon the
pedestal*”; but, as Heinichen remarks, in the excursus referred to just
above, the plant can hardly have grown *upon* the pedestal, and what is
more, we have no warrant for translating <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xii.xix-p6.2"></span>στήλη</span> “pedestal.” Paulus, in his
commentary on Matthew *in loco,* maintains that Eusebius is speaking
only of a representation upon the base of the statue, not of an actual
plant. But this interpretation, as Heinichen shows, is quite
unwarranted. For the use of <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xii.xix-p6.3"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xii.xix-p6.4"></span>πὶ</span> in the sense of “near” or
“beside,” we have numerous examples (see the instances given by
Heinichen, and also Liddell and Scott’s Greek Lexicon, *s.v.*).

<span id="fn_2298"></span>[304:2299](2010236.htm#fr_2298.md) <span
id="iii.xii.xix-p8.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.xix-p9"></span> Eusebius himself, as we learn from his
letter to the Empress Constantia Augusta (see above, p. 44), did not
approve of the use of images or representations of Christ, on the ground
that it tended to idolatry. In consequence of this disapproval he fell
into great disrepute in the later image-worshiping Church, his epistle
being cited by the iconoclasts at the second Council of Nicæa, in 787,
and his orthodoxy being in consequence fiercely attacked by the
defenders of image-worship, who dominated the council, and won the day.
