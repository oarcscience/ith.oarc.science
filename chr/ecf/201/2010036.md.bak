id="iii.vi.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter IX.—</span>*The Times of Pilate.*

<span id="iii.vi.ix-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.vi.ix-p2.1"></span>The</span> historian already mentioned agrees
with the evangelist in regard to the fact that Archelaus <span
id="fr_161"></span>[162](#fn_161.md) succeeded to the government after
Herod. He records the manner in which he received the kingdom of the
Jews by the will of his father Herod and by the decree of Cæsar
Augustus, and how, after he had reigned ten years, he lost his kingdom,
and his brothers Philip <span id="fr_162"></span>[163](#fn_162.md) and
Herod the younger, <span id="fr_163"></span>[164](#fn_163.md) with
Lysanias, <span id="fr_164"></span>[165](#fn_164.md) still ruled their own
tetrarchies. The same writer, in the eighteenth book of his
Antiquities, <span id="fr_165"></span>[166](#fn_165.md) says that about the
twelfth year of the reign of Tiberius, <span
id="fr_166"></span>[167](#fn_166.md) who had succeeded to the empire after
Augustus had ruled fifty-seven years, <span
id="fr_167"></span>[168](#fn_167.md) Pontius Pilate was entrusted with the
government of Judea, and that he remained there ten full years, almost
until the death of Tiberius.

<span id="iii.vi.ix-p10"></span>2. Accordingly the forgery of those who
have recently given currency to acts against our Saviour <span
id="fr_168"></span>[169](#fn_168.md) is clearly proved. For the very date
given in them <span id="fr_169"></span>[170](#fn_169.md) shows the
falsehood of their fabricators.

<span id="iii.vi.ix-p13"></span>3. For the things which they have dared
to say concerning the passion of the Saviour are put into the fourth
consulship of Tiberius, which occurred in the seventh year of his reign;
at which time it is plain that Pilate was not yet ruling in Judea, if
the testimony of Josephus is to be believed, who clearly shows in the
above-mentioned work <span id="fr_170"></span>[171](#fn_170.md) that Pilate
was made procurator of Judea by Tiberius in the twelfth year of his
reign.

<span id="iii.vi.ix-p3"></span> Archelaus was a son of Herod the Great,
and own brother of the Tetrarch Herod Antipas, with whom he was educated
at Rome. Immediately after the death of Antipater he was designated by
his father as his successor in the kingdom, and Augustus ratified the
will, but gave him only the title of ethnarch. The title of King he
never really received, although he is spoken of as king in [Matt. ii.
22](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#022.md)<span id="iii.vi.ix-p3.1"></span>,
the word being used in a loose sense. His dominion consisted of Idumea,
Judea, Samaria, and the cities on the coast, comprising a half of his
father’s kingdom. The other half was divided between Herod Antipas and
Philip. He was very cruel, and was warmly hated by most of his subjects.
In the tenth year of his reign (according to Josephus, *Ant.* XVII. 13.
2), or in the ninth (according to *B. J.* II. 7. 3), he was complained
against by his brothers and subjects on the ground of cruelty, and was
banished to Vienne in Gaul, where he probably died, although Jerome says
that he was shown his tomb near Bethlehem. Jerome’s report, however, is
too late to be of any value. The exact length of his reign it is
impossible to say, as Josephus is not consistent in his reports. The
difference may be due to the fact that Josephus reckoned from different
starting-points in the two cases. He probably ruled a little more than
nine years. His condemnation took place in the consulship of M. Æmilius
Lepidus and L. Arruntius (i.e. in 6 <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.vi.ix-p3.2"></span>a.d.</span>) according to Dion Cassius, LV.
27. After the deposition of Archelaus Judea was made a Roman province
and attached to Syria, and Coponius was sent as the first procurator. On
Archelaus, see Josephus, *Ant.* XVII. 8, 9, 11 sq., and *B. J.* I. 33. 8
sq.; II. 6 sq.

<span id="fn_162"></span>[96:163](2010036.htm#fr_162.md) <span
id="iii.vi.ix-p3.3"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.ix-p4"></span> Philip, a son of Herod the Great by his
wife Cleopatra, was Tetrarch of Batanea, Trachonitis, Aurinitis, &c.,
from <span class="c13"><span id="iii.vi.ix-p4.1"></span>b.c.</span> 4 to
<span class="c13"><span id="iii.vi.ix-p4.2"></span>a.d.</span> 34. He
was distinguished for his justice and moderation. He is mentioned only
once in the New Testament, [Luke iii.
1](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#001.md)<span id="iii.vi.ix-p4.3"></span>. On
Philip, see Josephus, *Ant.* XVII. 8. 1; 11. 4; XVIII. 4. 6.

<span id="fn_163"></span>[96:164](2010036.htm#fr_163.md) <span
id="iii.vi.ix-p4.4"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.ix-p5"></span> Herod Antipas, son of Herod the Great by
his wife Malthace, was Tetrarch of Galilee and Perea from <span
class="c13"><span id="iii.vi.ix-p5.1"></span>b.c.</span> 4 to <span
class="c13"><span id="iii.vi.ix-p5.2"></span>a.d.</span> 39. In 39 <span
class="c13"><span id="iii.vi.ix-p5.3"></span>a.d.</span> he went to Rome
to sue for the title of King, which his nephew Herod Agrippa had already
secured. But accusations against him were sent to the emperor by
Agrippa, and he thereby lost his tetrarchy and was banished to Lugdunum
(Lyons) in Gaul, and died (according to Josephus, *B. J.* II. 9. 6) in
Spain. It was he who beheaded John the Baptist, and to him Jesus was
sent by Pilate. His character is plain enough from the New Testament
account. For further particulars of his life, see Josephus, *Ant.* XVII.
8. 1; 11. 4; XVIII. 2. 1; 5 and 7; *B. J.* II. 9.

<span id="fn_164"></span>[96:165](2010036.htm#fr_164.md) <span
id="iii.vi.ix-p5.4"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.ix-p6"></span> The Lysanias referred to here is
mentioned in [Luke iii. 1](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#001.md)<span
id="iii.vi.ix-p6.1"></span> as Tetrarch of Abilene. Eusebius, in
speaking of Lysanias here, follows the account of Luke, not that of
Josephus, for the latter nowhere says that Lysanias continued to rule
his tetrarchy after the exile of Archelaus. Indeed he nowhere states
that Lysanias ruled a tetrarchy at this period. He only refers (*Ant.*
XVIII. 6. 10; XIX. 5. 1; XX. 7. 1; and *B. J.* II. 12. 8) to “the
tetrarchy of Lysanias,” which he says was given to Agrippa I. and II. by
Caligula and Claudius. Eusebius thus reads more into Josephus than he
has any right to do, and yet we cannot assume that he is guilty of
willful deception, for he may quite innocently have interpreted Josephus
in the light of Luke’s account, without realizing that Josephus’
statement is of itself entirely indefinite. That there is no real
contradiction between the statements of Josephus and Luke has been
abundantly demonstrated by Davidson, *Introduction to the New
Testament,* I. p. 215 sq.

<span id="iii.vi.ix-p7"></span> Josephus, *Ant.* XVIII. 2. 2 and 4. 2.

<span id="fn_166"></span>[96:167](2010036.htm#fr_166.md) <span
id="iii.vi.ix-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.ix-p8"></span> Josephus reckons here from the death of
Augustus (14 <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.vi.ix-p8.1"></span>a.d.</span>), when Tiberius became sole
emperor. Pilate was appointed procurator in 26 <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.vi.ix-p8.2"></span>a.d.</span> and was recalled in 36.

<span id="fn_167"></span>[96:168](2010036.htm#fr_167.md) <span
id="iii.vi.ix-p8.3"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.ix-p9"></span> Josephus dates the beginning of
Augustus’ reign at the time of the death of Julius Cæsar (as Eusebius
also does in chap. 5, §2), and calls him the second emperor. But
Augustus did not actually become emperor until 31 <span
class="c13"><span id="iii.vi.ix-p9.1"></span>b.c.</span>, after the
battle of Actium.

<span id="fn_168"></span>[96:169](2010036.htm#fr_168.md) <span
id="iii.vi.ix-p10.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.ix-p11"></span> Eusebius refers here, not to the acts
of Pilate written by Christians, of which so many are still extant (cf.
Bk. II. chap. 2, note 1), but to those forged by their enemies with the
approval of the emperor Maximinus (see below, Bk. IX. chap. 5).

<span id="fn_169"></span>[96:170](2010036.htm#fr_169.md) <span

place <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vi.ix-p12.3"></span>παρασ</span>. is the superscription or the
designation of the time which was customarily prefixed to acts. For
judicial acts were thus drawn up: *Consulatu Tiberii Augusti Septimo,
inducto in judicium Jesu,* &c.” (Val.)
