<span id="iii.vii.xviii-p1"></span> <span id="page_117">p. 117</span>
<span id="iii.vii.xviii-Page_117"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.vii.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVII.—</span>*Philo’s Account of
the Ascetics of Egypt.*

<span id="iii.vii.xviii-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.vii.xviii-p2.1"></span>It</span> is also said that Philo in the
reign of Claudius became acquainted at Rome with Peter, who was then
preaching there. <span id="fr_395"></span>[396](#fn_395.md) Nor is this
indeed improbable, for the work of which we have spoken, and which was
composed by him some years later, clearly contains those rules of the
Church which are even to this day observed among us.

<span id="iii.vii.xviii-p4"></span>2. And since he describes as
accurately as possible the life of our ascetics, it is clear that he not
only knew, but that he also approved, while he venerated and extolled,
the apostolic men of his time, who were as it seems of the Hebrew race,
and hence observed, after the manner of the Jews, the most of the
customs of the ancients.

<span id="iii.vii.xviii-p5"></span>3. In the work to which he gave the
title, *On a Contemplative Life or on Suppliants*, <span
id="fr_396"></span>[397](#fn_396.md) after affirming in the first place
that he will add to those things which he is about to relate nothing
contrary to truth or of his own invention, <span
id="fr_397"></span>[398](#fn_397.md) he says that these men were called
Therapeutæ and the women that were with them Therapeutrides. <span
id="fr_398"></span>[399](#fn_398.md) He then adds the reasons for such a
name, explaining it from the fact that they applied remedies and healed
the souls of those who came to them, by relieving them like physicians,
of evil passions, or from the fact that they served and worshiped the
Deity in purity and sincerity.

<span id="iii.vii.xviii-p9"></span>4. Whether Philo himself gave them
this name, employing an epithet well suited to their mode of life, or
whether the first of them really called themselves so in the beginning,
since the name of Christians was not yet everywhere known, we need not
discuss here.

<span id="iii.vii.xviii-p10"></span>5. He bears witness, however, that
first of all they renounce their property. When they begin the
philosophical <span id="fr_399"></span>[400](#fn_399.md) mode of life, he
says, they give up their goods to their relatives, and then, renouncing
all the cares of life, they go forth beyond the walls and dwell in
lonely fields and gardens, knowing well that intercourse with people of
a different character is unprofitable and harmful. They did this at that
time, as seems probable, under the influence of a spirited and ardent
faith, practicing in emulation the prophets’ mode of life.

<span id="iii.vii.xviii-p12"></span>6. For in the Acts of the Apostles,
a work universally acknowledged as authentic, <span
id="fr_400"></span>[401](#fn_400.md) it is recorded that all the <span
id="page_118">p. 118</span> <span
id="iii.vii.xviii-Page_118"></span>companions of the apostles sold their
possessions and their property and distributed to all according to the
necessity of each one, so that no one among them was in want. “For as
many as were possessors of lands or houses,” as the account says, “sold
them and brought the prices of the things that were sold, and laid them
at the apostles’ feet, so that distribution was made unto every man
according as he had need.” <span id="fr_401"></span>[402](#fn_401.md)

<span id="iii.vii.xviii-p15"></span>7. Philo bears witness to facts very
much like those here described and then adds the following
account: <span id="fr_402"></span>[403](#fn_402.md) “Everywhere in the
world is this race <span id="fr_403"></span>[404](#fn_403.md) found. For it
was fitting that both Greek <span id="fr_404"></span>[405](#fn_404.md) and
Barbarian should share in what is perfectly good. But the race
particularly abounds in Egypt, in each of its so-called nomes, <span
id="fr_405"></span>[406](#fn_405.md) and especially about Alexandria.

<span id="iii.vii.xviii-p20"></span>8. The best men from every quarter
emigrate, as if to a colony of the Therapeutæ’s fatherland, <span
id="fr_406"></span>[407](#fn_406.md) to a certain very suitable spot which
lies above the lake Maria <span id="fr_407"></span>[408](#fn_407.md) upon a
low hill excellently situated on account of its security and the
mildness of the atmosphere.”

<span id="iii.vii.xviii-p23"></span>9. And then a little further on,
after describing the kind of houses which they had, he speaks as follows
concerning their churches, which were scattered about here and
there: <span id="fr_408"></span>[409](#fn_408.md) “In each house there is a
sacred apartment which is called a sanctuary and monastery, <span
id="fr_409"></span>[410](#fn_409.md) where, quite alone, they perform the
mysteries of the religious life. They bring nothing into it, neither
drink nor food, nor any of the other things which contribute to the
necessities of the body, but only the laws, and the inspired oracles of
the prophets, and hymns and such other things as augment and make
perfect their knowledge and piety.”

<span id="iii.vii.xviii-p26"></span>10. And after some other matters he
says: <span id="fr_410"></span>[411](#fn_410.md)

<span id="iii.vii.xviii-p28"></span>“The whole interval, from morning to
evening, is for them a time of exercise. For they read the holy
Scriptures, and explain the philosophy of their fathers in an
allegorical manner, regarding the written words as symbols of hidden
truth which is communicated in obscure figures.

<span id="iii.vii.xviii-p29"></span>11. They have also writings of
ancient men, who were the founders of their sect, and who left many
monuments of the allegorical method. These they use as models, and
imitate their principles.”

<span id="iii.vii.xviii-p30"></span>12. These things seem to have been
stated by a man who had heard them expounding their sacred writings. But
it is highly probable that the works of the ancients, which he says they
had, were the Gospels and the writings of the apostles, and probably
some expositions of the ancient prophets, such as are contained in the
Epistle to the Hebrews, and in many others of Paul’s Epistles.

<span id="iii.vii.xviii-p31"></span>13. Then again he writes as follows
concerning the new psalms which they composed: <span
id="fr_411"></span>[412](#fn_411.md) “So that they not only spend their
time in meditation, but they also compose songs and hymns to God in
every variety of metre and melody, though they divide them, of course,
into measures of more than common solemnity.”

<span id="iii.vii.xviii-p33"></span>14. The same book contains an
account of many other things, but it seemed necessary to select those
facts which exhibit the characteristics of the ecclesiastical mode of
life.

<span id="iii.vii.xviii-p34"></span>15. But if any one thinks that what
has been said is not peculiar to the Gospel polity, but that it can be
applied to others besides those mentioned, let him be convinced by the
subsequent words of the same author, in which, if he is unprejudiced, he
will find undisputed testimony on this subject. Philo’s words are as
follows: <span id="fr_412"></span>[413](#fn_412.md)

<span id="iii.vii.xviii-p36"></span>16. “Having laid down temperance as
a sort of foundation in the soul, they build upon it the other virtues.
None of them may take food or drink before sunset, since they regard
philosophizing as a work worthy of the light, but attention to the wants
of the body as proper only in the darkness, and therefore assign the day
to the former, but to the latter a small portion of the night.

<span id="iii.vii.xviii-p37"></span>17. But some, in whom a great desire
for knowledge dwells, forget to take food for three days; and some are
so delighted and feast so luxuriously upon wisdom, which furnishes
doctrines richly and without stint, that they abstain even twice as long
as this, and are accustomed, after six days, scarcely to take necessary
food.” These statements of Philo we regard as referring clearly and
indisputably to those of our communion.

<span id="iii.vii.xviii-p38"></span>18. But if after these things any
one still obstinately persists in denying the reference, let him
renounce his incredulity and be convinced by yet more striking examples,
which are to be found nowhere else than in the evangelical religion of
the Christians. <span id="fr_413"></span>[414](#fn_413.md)

<span id="iii.vii.xviii-p40"></span>19. For they say that there were
women also with those of whom we are speaking, and that the most of them
were aged virgins <span id="fr_414"></span>[415](#fn_414.md) who had
preserved <span id="page_119">p. 119</span> <span
id="iii.vii.xviii-Page_119"></span>their chastity, not out of necessity,
as some of the priestesses among the Greeks, <span
id="fr_415"></span>[416](#fn_415.md) but rather by their own choice,
through zeal and a desire for wisdom. And that in their earnest desire
to live with it as their companion they paid no attention to the
pleasures of the body, seeking not mortal but immortal progeny, which
only the pious soul is able to bear of itself.

<span id="iii.vii.xviii-p43"></span>20. Then after a little he adds
still more emphatically: <span id="fr_416"></span>[417](#fn_416.md) “They
expound the Sacred Scriptures figuratively by means of allegories. For
the whole law seems to these men to resemble a living organism, of which
the spoken words constitute the body, while the hidden sense stored up
within the words constitutes the soul. This hidden meaning has first
been particularly studied by this sect, which sees, revealed as in a
mirror of names, the surpassing beauties of the thoughts.”

<span id="iii.vii.xviii-p45"></span>21. Why is it necessary to add to
these things their meetings and the respective occupations of the men
and of the women during those meetings, and the practices which are even
to the present day habitually observed by us, especially such as we are
accustomed to observe at the feast of the Saviour’s passion, with
fasting and night watching and study of the divine Word.

<span id="iii.vii.xviii-p46"></span>22. These things the above-mentioned
author has related in his own work, indicating a mode of life which has
been preserved to the present time by us alone, recording especially the
vigils kept in connection with the great festival, and the exercises
performed during those vigils, and the hymns customarily recited by us,
and describing how, while one sings regularly in time, the others listen
in silence, and join in chanting only the close of the hymns; and how,
on the days referred to they sleep on the ground on beds of straw, and
to use his own words, <span id="fr_417"></span>[418](#fn_417.md) “taste no
wine at all, nor any flesh, but water is their only drink, and the reish
with their bread is salt and hyssop.”

<span id="iii.vii.xviii-p48"></span>23. In addition to this Philo
describes the order of dignities which exists among those who carry on
the services of the church, mentioning the diaconate, and the office of
bishop, which takes the precedence over all the others. <span
id="fr_418"></span>[419](#fn_418.md) But whosoever desires a more accurate
knowledge of these matters may get it from the history already cited.

<span id="iii.vii.xviii-p50"></span>24. But that Philo, when he wrote
these things, had in view the first heralds of the Gospel and the
customs handed down from the beginning by the apostles, is clear to
every one.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_395"></span>[117:396](2010059.htm#fr_395.md) <span
id="iii.vii.xviii-p2.2"></span>

<span id="iii.vii.xviii-p3"></span> This tradition that Philo met Peter
in Rome and formed an acquaintance with him is repeated by Jerome (*de
vir ill.* 11), and by Photius (*Cod.* 105), who even goes further, and
says directly that Philo became a Christian. The tradition, however,
must be regarded as quite worthless. It is absolutely certain from
Philo’s own works, and from the otherwise numerous traditions of
antiquity that he never was a Christian, and aside from the report of
Eusebius (for Jerome and Photius do not represent an independent
tradition) there exists no hint of such a meeting between Peter and
Philo; and when we realize that Philo was already an old man in the time
of Caius (see above, chap. 4, note 8), and that Peter certainly did not
reach Rome before the later years of Nero’s reign, we may say that such
a meeting as Eusebius records (only upon tradition, <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.vii.xviii-p3.1"></span>λόγος žχει</span>) is
certainly not historical. Where Eusebius got the tradition we do not
know. It may have been manufactured in the interest of the Philonic
authorship of the *De vita contemplativa,* or it may have been a natural
outgrowth of the ascription of that work to him, some such explanation
suggesting itself to the reader of that work as necessary to explain
Philo’s supposed praise of Christian monks. Philo’s visit to Rome during
the reign of Caligula being a well-known historic fact, and Peter’s
visit to Rome during the reign of Claudius being assumed as likewise
historic (see above, chap. 14, note 8), it was not difficult to suppose
a meeting between them (the great Christian apostle and the great Jewish
philosopher), and to invent for the purpose a second visit of Philo to
Rome. It seems probable that the ascription of the work *De vita
contemplativa* to Philo came before the tradition of his acquaintance
with Peter in Rome (which is first mentioned by Eusebius); but in any
case the two were mutually corroborative.

<span id="fn_396"></span>[117:397](2010059.htm#fr_396.md) <span
id="iii.vii.xviii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vii.xviii-p6"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vii.xviii-p6.1"></span>περὶ βίου θεωρητικοῦ ἢ ἱκετῶν</span>; *De
Vita Contemplativa.* This work is still extant, and is given by Mangey,
II. 471–486. Eusebius is the first writer to mention it, and he
identifies the Therapeutæ described in it with the Christian monks, and
assumes in consequence that monasticism in the form in which he knew it
existed in the apostolic age, and was known and praised by Philo. This
opinion was generally adopted by the Fathers (with the single exception
of Photius, *Cod.* 105, who looked upon the Therapeutæ as a Jewish sect)
and prevailed unquestioned until the Reformation, when in the Protestant
reaction against monasticism it was denied that monks existed in the
apostolic age, and that the Therapeutæ were Christians at all. Various
opinions as to their identity have been held since that time, the
commonest being that they were a Jewish sect or school, parallel with
the Palestinian Essenes, or that they were an outgrowth of Alexandrian
Neo-Pythagoreanism. The former opinion may be said to have been the
prevailing one among Christian scholars until Lucius, in his work
entitled *Die Therapeuten und ihre Stellung in der Gesch. der Askese*
(Strassburg, 1879), proved (what had been asserted already by Grätz and
Jost) that the Therapeutæ are really to be identified with Christian
monks, and that the work *De Vita Contemplativa* is not a genuine work
of Philo’s. If the former proposition is proved, the latter follows of
necessity, for it is absolutely impossible to suppose that monasticism
can have existed in so developed a form (or indeed in any form) in the
time of Philo. On the other hand it may be proved that the work is not
Philonic, and yet it may not follow that the Therapeutæ are to be
identified with Christian monks. And so some scholars reject the
Philonic authorship while still maintaining the Jewish character of the
Therapeutæ (e.g. Nicolas, Kuenen, and Weingarten; see Schürer, *Gesch.
der Juden im Zeitalter Jesu Christi,* p. 863). In the opinion of the
writer, who agrees therein with the great majority of scholars, Lucius
has conclusively demonstrated both his propositions, and has shown that
the work *De Vita Contemplativa* is the production of some Christian of
the latter part of the third century, who aimed to produce an apology
for and a panegyric of monasticism as it existed in his day, and thus to
secure for it wider recognition and acceptance. Lucius concludes with
the following words: “Wir haben es demnach in D.V.C. mit einer
Tendenzschrift zu thun, welche, da sie eine weit ausgebildete und in
zahlreichen Ländern verbreitete Askese, so wie Zustände voraussetzt,
genau wie dieselben nur im Christenthum des dritten Jahrhunderts
vorhanden waren, kaum anders aufgefasst werden kann, als eine, etwa am
Ende des dritten Jahrhunderts, unter dem Namen Philo’s, zu Gunsten der
Christlichen Askese, verfasste Apologie, als erstes Glied eines an
derartigen Producte überaus reichen Litteratur-zweige der alten Kirche.”
Compare with Lucius’ work the reviews of it by Hilgenfeld in the
*Zeitschrift für wiss. Theol.,* 1880, pp. 423–440, and by Schürer in the
*Theologische Literaturzeitung,* 1880, No. 5. The latter especially has
added some important considerations with reference to the reasons for
the composition of this work under the name of Philo. Assuming then the
correctness of Lucius’ conclusions, we see that Eusebius was quite right
in identifying the Therapeutæ with the Christian monks as he knew them
in his day, but that he was quite wrong in accepting the Philonic
authorship of the work in question, and in concluding that the
institution of monasticism as he knew it existed already in the
apostolic age (compare note 19, below).

<span id="fn_397"></span>[117:398](2010059.htm#fr_397.md) <span
id="iii.vii.xviii-p6.2"></span>

<span id="iii.vii.xviii-p7"></span> It may fairly be doubted whether the
work does not really contain considerable that is not in strict
accordance with the facts observed by the author, whether his account is
not to an extent idealized, and whether, in his endeavor to emphasize
the Jewish character of the Therapeutæ, with the design of establishing
the antiquity of monasticism (compare the review of Schürer referred to
above), he has not allowed himself to introduce some imaginative
elements. The strong asseveration which he makes of the truthfulness of
his account would rather increase than allay this suspicion, and the
account itself at certain points seems to bear it out. On the whole,
however, it may be regarded as a reasonably accurate sketch. Were it not
such, Eusebius would not have accepted it, so unreservedly as he does,
as an account of Christian monks. Lucius’ exhibition of the points of
similarity between the practices of the Therapeutæ, as described here,
and of early Christian monks, as known from other sources, is very
interesting (see p. 158 sq.).

that the words were accidentally omitted by him.

<span id="iii.vii.xviii-p19"></span> Egypt, exclusive of the cities

<span id="iii.vii.xviii-p41"></span> How Eusebius, who knew that Philo
lived and wrote during the reign of Claudius, could have overlooked the
fact that Christianity had not at that time been long enough established
to admit of virgins growing old within the Church, is almost
inexplicable. It is but another example of his carelessness in regard to
chronology which comes out so often in his history. Compare Stroth’s
words: “In der That ein wichtiger Beweis, der gerade der irrigen Meinung
des Eusebius am meisten entgegen ist. Denn sie hätten alt zum
Christenthum kommen müssen, sonst konnten sie ja zu Philo’s Zeiten
unmöglich im Christenthum alt geworden sein, dessen Schrift Eusebius
selbst in die Regierung des Claudius setzt. Es ist beinahe
unbegreiflich, wie ein so guter Kopf, wie Eusebius ist, in so grobe
Irrthümer fallen konnte.”

<span id="iii.vii.xviii-p49"></span> *Ibid.*§§8–10. The author of the
*D. V. C.* mentions young men that serve at table (<span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.vii.xviii-p49.1"></span>διακονοῦντες</span>)
and a president (<span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vii.xviii-p49.2"></span>πρόεδρος</span>) who leads in the
exposition of the Scriptures. Eusebius is quite right in finding in
these persons deacons and bishops. The similarity is too close to be
merely accidental, and the comment of Stroth upon this passage is quite
unwarranted: “Was einer doch alles in einer Stelle finden kann, wenn er
es darin finden will! Philo sagt, dass bei ihren gemeinschaftlichen
Gastmählern einige bei Tische dienten (<span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vii.xviii-p49.3"></span>διακονοῦντες</span>), hieraus macht
Eusebius Diakonate; und dass bei ihren Untersuchungen über die Bibel
einer (<span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vii.xviii-p49.4"></span>πρόεδρος</span>) den Vorsitz habe;
hieraus macht Eusebius die bischöfliche würde (<span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vii.xviii-p49.5"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vii.xviii-p49.6"></span>πισκοπῆς προεδρίαν</span>).”
