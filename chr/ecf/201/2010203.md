<span id="iii.xi.xxxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xi.xxxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXIII.—</span>*The Error of
Beryllus.*

<span id="iii.xi.xxxiii-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xi.xxxiii-p2.1"></span>Beryllus, <span
id="fr_2032"></span>[2033](#fn_2032) </span> whom we mentioned recently
as bishop of Bostra in Arabia, turned aside from the ecclesiastical
standard <span id="fr_2033"></span>[2034](#fn_2033) and attempted to
introduce ideas foreign to the faith. He dared to assert that our
Saviour and Lord did not pre-exist in a distinct form of being of his
own <span id="fr_2034"></span>[2035](#fn_2034) before his abode among
men, and that he does not possess a divinity of his own, <span
id="fr_2035"></span>[2036](#fn_2035) but only that of the Father
dwelling in him.

<span id="iii.xi.xxxiii-p7"></span>2. Many bishops carried on
investigations and discussions with him on this matter, and Origen
having been invited with the others, went down at first for a conference
with him to ascertain his real opinion. But when he understood his
views, and perceived that they were erroneous, having persuaded him by
argument, and convinced him by demonstration, he brought him back to the
true doctrine, and re<span id="page_278">p. 278</span> <span
id="iii.xi.xxxiii-Page_278"></span>stored him to his former sound
opinion.

<span id="iii.xi.xxxiii-p8"></span>3. There are still extant writings of
Beryllus and of the synod held on his account, which contain the
questions put to him by Origen, and the discussions which were carried
on in his parish, as well as all the things done at that time.

<span id="iii.xi.xxxiii-p9"></span>4. The elder brethren among us <span
id="fr_2036"></span>[2037](#fn_2036) have handed down many other facts
respecting Origen which I think proper to omit, as not pertaining to
this work. But whatever it has seemed necessary to record about him can
be found in the Apology in his behalf written by us and Pamphilus, the
holy martyr of our day. We prepared this carefully and did the work
jointly on account of faultfinders. <span

<span id="iii.xi.xxxiii-p3"></span> Beryllus, bishop of Bostra in Arabia
(mentioned above, in chap. 20) is chiefly noted on account of the heresy
into which he fell, and from which Origen won him back, by convincing
him of his error. According to chap. 20, he was a learned and cultured
man, and Jerome (*de vir. ill.* c. 60) says of him, *gloriose rexisset
ecclesiam.* We do not know his dates, but we may gather from this
chapter that the synod which was called on his account convened during
the reign of Gordian (238–244), and apparently toward the close of the
reign. Our sources for a knowledge of the heresy of Beryllus are very
meager. We have only the brief passage in this chapter; a fragment of
Origen’s commentary on Titus (Lommatzsch, V. 287), which undoubtedly
refers to Beryllus’ error, though he is not mentioned by name; and
finally, a single sentence in Jerome’s *de vir. ill.* c. 60 (*Christum
ante incarnationem regat*), which, however, is apparently no more than
his own interpretation of Eusebius’ words. Our sources have been
interpreted very differently, some holding Beryllus to have been a
Patripassian, others classing him with the Artemonites (see above, Bk.
V. chap. 28). He was, at any rate, a Monarchion, and his position, not
to enter here into details, seems to have been that our Lord did not
pre-exist as an independent being; but that, with the incarnation, he,
who had previously been identified with the <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xi.xxxiii-p3.1"></span>πατρικὴ θεότης</span>, became a distinct
being, possessed of an independent existence (see Dorner’s *Person of
Christ,* Div. I. Vol. II. p. 35 sq., Edinburgh edition). According to
this chapter and chap. 20, Beryllus was the author of numerous treatises
and epistles, which were extant in Eusebius’ time. According to Jerome
(*l.c.*), he wrote, *varia opuscula et maxime epistolas, in quibus
Origeni gratias agit.* Jerome reports, also, that there were extant in
his time epistles of Origen, addressed to Beryllus, and a dialogue
between Origen and Beryllus. All traces of these epistles and other
works have perished.
