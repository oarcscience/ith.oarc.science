<span id="iii.vii.xxv-p4"></span> Annianus, according to Bk. III. chap.
14, below, held his office twenty-two years. In *Apost. Const.* VII. 46
he is said to have been ordained by Mark as the first bishop of
Alexandria. The *Chron. Orient.* 89 (according to Westcott in the *Dict.
of Christ. Biog.*) reports that he was appointed by Mark after he had
performed a miracle upon him. He is commemorated in the Roman
martyrology with St. Mark, on April 25.
