<span id="iii.x.xxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.x.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIII.—</span>*The Question then
agitated concerning the Passover.*

<span id="iii.x.xxiv-p2"></span>1. A <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.x.xxiv-p2.1"></span>question</span> of no small importance arose
at that time. For the parishes of all Asia, as from an older tradition,
held that the fourteenth day of the moon, on which day the Jews were
commanded to sacrifice the lamb, should be observed as the feast of the
Saviour’s passover. <span id="fr_1686"></span>[1687](#fn_1686.md) It was
therefore necessary to end their fast on that day, whatever day of the
week it should happen to be. But it was not the custom of the churches
in the rest of the world to end it at this time, as they observed the
practice which, from apostolic tradition, has prevailed to the present
time, of terminating the fast on no other day than on that of the
resurrection of our Saviour.

<span id="iii.x.xxiv-p4"></span>2. Synods and assemblies of bishops were
held on this account, <span id="fr_1687"></span>[1688](#fn_1687.md) and
all, with one consent, through mutual correspondence drew up an
ecclesiastical decree, that the mystery of the resurrection of the Lord
should be celebrated on no other but the Lord’s day, and that we should
observe the close of the paschal fast on this day only. There is still
extant a writing of those who were then assembled in Palestine, over
whom Theophilus, <span id="fr_1688"></span>[1689](#fn_1688.md) bishop of
Cæsarea, and Narcissus, bishop of Jerusalem, presided. And there is also
another writing extant of those who were assembled at Rome to consider
the same question, which bears the name of Bishop Victor; <span
id="fr_1689"></span>[1690](#fn_1689.md) also of the bishops in <span
id="page_242">p. 242</span> <span id="iii.x.xxiv-Page_242"></span>Pontus
over whom Palmas, <span id="fr_1690"></span>[1691](#fn_1690.md) as the
oldest, presided; and of the parishes in Gaul of which Irenæus was
bishop, and of those in Osrhoëne <span
id="fr_1691"></span>[1692](#fn_1691.md) and the cities there; and a
personal letter of Bacchylus, <span id="fr_1692"></span>[1693](#fn_1692.md)
bishop of the church at Corinth, and of a great many others, who uttered
the same opinion and judgment, and cast the same vote.

<span id="iii.x.xxiv-p11"></span>3. And that which has been given above
was their unanimous decision. <span id="fr_1693"></span>[1694](#fn_1693.md)

<span id="iii.x.xxiv-p3"></span> The great question of dispute between
the church of Asia Minor and the rest of Christendom was whether the
paschal communion should be celebrated on the fourteenth of Nisan, or on
the Sunday of the resurrection festival, without regard to Jewish
chronology. The Christians of Asia Minor, appealing to the example of
the apostles, John and Philip, and to the uniform practice of the
Church, celebrated the Christian passover always on the fourteenth of
Nisan, whatever day of the week that might be, by a solemn fast, and
closed the day with the communion in commemoration of the last paschal
supper of Christ. The Roman church, on the other hand, followed by all
the rest of Christendom, celebrated the death of Christ always on
Friday, and his resurrection on the Sunday following the first full moon
after the vernal equinox, and continued their paschal fast until the
latter day. It thus happened that the fast of the Asiatic Christians,
terminating, as it did, with the fourteenth of Nisan, often closed some
days before the fast of the other churches, and the lack of uniformity
occasioned great scandal. As Schaff says: “The gist of the paschal
controversy was whether the Jewish paschal day (be it a Friday or not)
or the Christian Sunday should control the idea and time of the entire
festival.” The former practice emphasized Christ’s death; the latter his
resurrection. The first discussion of the question took place between
Polycarp and Anicetus, bishop of Rome, when the former was on a visit to
that city, between 150 and 155. Irenæus gives an account of this which
is quoted by Eusebius in chap. 25. Polycarp clung to the Asiatic
practice of observing the 14th of Nisan, but could not persuade Anicetus
to do the same, nor could Anicetus persuade him not to observe that day.
They nevertheless communed together in Rome, and separated in peace.
About 170 <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.x.xxiv-p3.1"></span>a.d.</span> the controversy broke out again
in Laodicea, the chief disputants being Melito of Sardis and Apolinarius
of Hierapolis (see above, Bk. IV. chap. 26, note 1, and chap. 27, note
1). In this controversy Melito advocated the traditional Asiatic custom
of observing the fourteenth day, while Apolinarius opposed it. To
distinguish two parties of Quartodecimans,—a Judaizing and a more
orthodox,—as must be done if Apolinarius is regarded, as he is by many,
as a Quartodeciman, is, as Schaff shows entirely unwarranted. We know
only of the one party, and Apolinarius did not belong to it. The third
stage of the controversy, which took place while Victor was bishop of
Rome, in the last decade of the second century, was much more bitter and
important. The leaders of the two sides were Polycrates, bishop of
Ephesus, and Victor, bishop of Rome,—the latter an overbearing man, who
believed that he, as Bishop of Rome, had a right to demand of all other
churches conformity to the practices of his own church. The controversy
came to an open rupture between the churches of Asia and that of Rome,
but other churches did not sympathize with the severe measures of
Victor, and the breach was gradually healed—just how and when we do not
know; but the Roman practice gradually prevailed over the Asiatic, and
finally, at the Council of Nicæa (325), was declared binding upon the
whole Church, while the old Asiatic practice was condemned. This
decision was acquiesced in by the bishops of Asia, as well as by the
rest of the world, and only scattered churches continued to cling to the
practice of the earlier Asiatics, and they were branded as heretics, and
called Quartodecimanians (from *quarta decima*), a name which we carry
back and apply to all who observed the fourteenth day, even those of the
second and third centuries. This brief summary will enable us better to
understand the accounts of Eusebius, who is our chief authority on the
subject. The paschal controversy has had an important bearing upon the
question of the authenticity of the fourth Gospel, the Tübingen critics
having drawn from this controversy one of their strongest arguments
against its genuineness. This subject cannot be discussed here, but the
reader is referred, for a brief statement of the case, to Schaff’s *Ch.
Hist.* II. 219. The Johannine controversy has given rise to an extensive
literature on these paschal disputes. Among the most important’ works
are Hilgenfeld’s *Der Paschastreit der alten Kirche nach seiner
Bedeutung fur die Kirchengesch. u. s. w.;* and Schürer’s *Die
Paschastreitigkeiten des zweiten Jahrhunderts,* in the *Zeitschrift für
hist. Theologie,* 1870, p. 182–284,—the latter perhaps the ablest
extended discussion of the subject extant. The reader is also referred
to the article *Easter,* in Smith’s *Dict. of Christ. Ant.;* to Hefele’s
*Conciliengesch.* I. p. 86–101; and especially to the chapter on the
paschal controversies in Schaff’s *Ch. Hist.* Vol. II. p. 209–220. This
chapter of Schaff’s is the clearest, and, in the opinion of the writer,
by far the most satisfactory, brief statement of the whole subject which
we have.

<span id="fn_1687"></span>[241:1688](2010164.htm#fr_1687.md) <span
id="iii.x.xxiv-p4.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.xxiv-p5"></span> Although other synods are mentioned by
the *Libellus synodicus* (of the ninth century), the only ones which we
have good reason for accepting are those mentioned by Eusebius in this
chapter and the next; viz. one in Palestine (the *Libellus synodicus*
gives two: one at Jerusalem, presided over by Narcissus, and another at
Cæsarea, presided over by Theophilus, but the report is too late to be
of authority); one in Pontus, under the presidency of Palmas; one in
Gaul, under Irenæus; one in Osrhoëne in Mesopotamia; and one in Asia
Minor, under Polycrates. Hefele (*Conciliengesch.* I. p. 101) adds one
in Rome under Victor; and although Eusebius does not distinctly mention
such a synod, we are undoubtedly to conclude that the epistle written by
Victor was a synodical epistle and hence Hefele is, in all probability,
correct in assuming that some kind of a synod, whether municipal or
provincial, took place there at this time (see note 4). From the words
of Eusebius at the close of the chapter, we may gather that still other
synods than those mentioned by him were held on this subject. The date
of all of these councils is commonly given as 198 <span
class="c13"><span id="iii.x.xxiv-p5.1"></span>a.d.</span>, but there is
no particular authority for that year. Jerome’s version of the *Chron.*
assigns the composition of the various epistles to the fourth year of
Septimius Severus (196–197); but it is clear that he is giving only an
approximate date. We can say only that the synods took place sometime
during Victor’s episcopate. All the councils, as we learn from this
chapter, except the one under Polycrates in Asia Minor, decided against
the Quartodeciman practice. Athanasius, however (*de Syn.* c. 5), speaks
of Christians of Syria, Cilicia, and Mesopotamia as celebrating the
paschal feast on the fourteenth day; and Jerome (*de vir. ill.* c. 35)
says that many bishops of Asia *and of the Orient* kept up this
observance. It is possible that the practice was from the beginning more
widely spread than Eusebius supposed, or, what is more probable, that
the words of Athanasius and Jerome refer to individual churches and
bishops, whose observance of the fourteenth day was not general enough
to invalidate what Eusebius says of the common consent of the whole
Church, outside of Asia Minor, against the Quartodeciman practice, and
that this individual observance, not being officially recognized by any
synod, did not seem to him to require mention.

id="iii.x.xxiv-p7.1"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.x.xxiv-p7.2"></span>πίσκοπον βίκτορα δηλοῦσα</span>. This and
the following epistles are no longer extant, nor have we any fragments
of them. They seem to have disappeared, even before Jerome’s time; at
least, he speaks only of the memory of them as remaining to his day (see
chap. 22, note 6). Heinichen is certainly wrong in making this epistle
an individual letter from Victor alone, for Eusebius expressly says that
the epistle was from “those at Rome” (<span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.x.xxiv-p7.3"></span>τῶν ἐπὶ ῾Ρώμης</span>), which seems to imply
a council, as in the other cases. The grammatical construction naturally
leads us to supply with the <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.x.xxiv-p7.4"></span>τῶν</span> the word used with it in the
previous sentence, <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.x.xxiv-p7.5"></span>συγκεκροτημένων</span>,—“those who were
assembled.” Valesius, Hefele, and others are, therefore, quite justified
in assuming that, according to Eusebius, a synod met at Rome, also, at
this time.

<span id="iii.x.xxiv-p10"></span> This epistle of Bacchylus is
distinguished from the preceding ones by the fact that it is not a
synodical or collective epistle but the independent production of one
man, if Eusebius’ report is correct (see the preceding chapter, note 8).
The epistles “of many others,” mentioned in the next sentence, may have
been of the same kind.

fourteenth day.
