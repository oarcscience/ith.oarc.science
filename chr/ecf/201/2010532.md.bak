id="iv.vi.iii.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIII</span>.—*How he led the
Dissentient Bishops to Harmony of Sentiment.*

<span id="iv.vi.iii.xiii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.xiii-p2.1"></span>As</span> soon as the emperor had spoken
these words in the Latin tongue, which another interpreted, he gave
permission to those who presided in the council to deliver their
opinions. On this some began to accuse their neighbors, who defended
themselves, and recriminated in their turn. In this manner numberless
assertions were put forth by each party, and a violent controversy arose
at the very commencement. Notwithstanding this, the emperor gave patient
audience to all alike, and received every proposition with steadfast
attention, and by occasionally assisting the argument of each party in
turn, he gradually disposed even the most vehement disputants to a
reconciliation. At the same time, by the affability of his address to
all, and his use of the Greek language, with which he was not altogether
unacquainted, he appeared in a truly attractive and amiable light,
persuading some, convincing others by his reasonings, praising those who
spoke well, and urging all to unity of sentiment, until at last he
succeeded in bringing them to one mind and judgment respecting every
disputed question.
