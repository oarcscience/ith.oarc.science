<span id="iii.xi.i-p3"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xi.i-p3.1"></span>When</span> Severus began to persecute the
churches, <span id="fr_1764"></span>[1765](#fn_1764.md) glorious
testimonies were given everywhere by the athletes of religion. This was
especially the case in Alexandria, to which city, as to a most prominent
theater, athletes of God were brought from Egypt and all Thebais
according to their merit, and won crowns from God through their great
patience under many tortures and every mode of death. Among these was
Leonides, who was called the father of Origen, <span
id="fr_1765"></span>[1766](#fn_1765.md) and who was beheaded while his son
was still young. How remarkable the predilection of this son was for the
Divine Word, in consequence of his father’s instruction, it will not be
amiss to state briefly, as his fame has been very greatly celebrated by
many.

<span id="iii.xi.i-p4"></span> During the early years of the reign of
Septimius Severus the Christians enjoyed comparative peace, and Severus
himself showed them considerable favor. Early in the third century a
change set in, and in 202 the emperor issued an edict forbidding
conversions to Christianity and to Judaism (Spartianus, *in Severo,* c.
16; cf. Tillemont, *Hist. des Emp.* III. p. 58). The cause of this
radical change of conduct we do not know, but it is possible that the
excesses of the Montanists produced a reaction in the emperor’s mind
against the Christians, or that the rapidity with which Christianity was
spreading caused him to fear that the old Roman institutions would be
overturned, and hence produced a reaction against it. Why the Jews, too,
should have been attacked, it is hard to say,—possibly because of a new
attempt on their part to throw off the Roman yoke (see Spartianus, *in
Severo,* c. 16); or perhaps there underlay the whole movement a reaction
in the emperor’s mind toward the old Roman paganism (he was always
superstitious), and Judaism and Christianity being looked upon as alike
opposed to it, were alike to be held in check. The edict was aimed, not
against those already Christians, but only against new converts, the
idea being to prevent the further spread of Christianity. But the change
in the emperor’s attitude, thus published abroad, at once intensified
all the elements which were hostile to Christianity; and the popular
disfavor, which continued widespread and was continually venting itself
in local persecutions, now allowed itself freer rein, and the result was
that severe persecutions broke out, which were confined, however, almost
wholly to Egypt and North Africa. Our principal authorities for these
persecutions (which went on intermittently, during the rest of Severus’
reign) are the first twelve chapters of this book of Eusebius’
*History,* and a number of Tertullian’s works, especially his *De corona
milites, Ad Scap.,* and *De fuga in persecutione.*

<span id="iii.xi.i-p5"></span> We know very little about Origen’s
father. The fame of the son overshadowed that of the father, even though
the latter was a martyr. The phrase used in this passage to describe him
has caused some trouble. <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xi.i-p5.1"></span>Λεωνίδης ὁ λεγόμενος ᾽Ωριγένους πατήρ</span>.
Taken in its usual sense, the expression means “said to be the father of
Origen,” or the “so-called father of Origen,” both of which appear
strange, for there can have been no doubt as to his identity. It seems
better, with Westcott, to understand that Eusebius means that Origen’s
fame had so eclipsed his father’s that the latter was distinguished as
“Leonides, the father of Origen,” and hence says here, “Leonides, who
was known as the father of Origen.” The name Leonides is Greek, and that
he was of Greek nationality is further confirmed by the words of
Porphyry (quoted in chap. 19, below), who calls Origen “a Greek, and
educated in Greek literature.” Porphyry may simply have concluded from
his knowledge of Greek letters that he was a Greek by birth, and hence
his statement taken alone has little weight; but taken in conjunction
with Leonides’ name, it makes it probable that the latter was at least
of Greek descent; whether a native of Greece or not we do not know. A
late tradition makes him a bishop, but there is no foundation for such a
report. From the next chapter we learn that Leonides’ martyrdom took
place in the tenth year of Severus (201–202 <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xi.i-p5.2"></span>a.d.</span>), which is stated also by the
*Chron.*
