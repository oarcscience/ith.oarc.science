<span id="iv.vi.iv.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII</span>.—*He declares that,
having witnessed the Fall of the Persecutors, he now rejoices at the
Peace enjoyed by the Christians.*

<span id="iv.vi.iv.xii-p2"></span>“<span class="c13"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.xii-p2.1"></span>And</span> it is surely a happy
circumstance that the punishment of such persons as I have described
should have been publicly manifested in our own times. For I myself have
witnessed the end of those who lately harassed the worshipers of God by
their impious edict. And for this abundant thanksgivings are due to God
that through his excellent Providence all men who observe his holy laws
are gladdened by the renewed enjoyment of peace. Hence I am fully
persuaded that everything is in the best and safest posture, since God
is vouchsafing, through the influence of their pure and faithful
religious service, and their unity of judgment respecting his Divine
character, to gather all men to himself.
