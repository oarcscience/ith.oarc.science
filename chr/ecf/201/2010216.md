<span id="iii.xi.xlvi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xi.xlvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLVI.—</span>*Other Epistles of
Dionysius.*

<span id="iii.xi.xlvi-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xi.xlvi-p2.1"></span>He</span> wrote also an epistle to the
brethren in Egypt on Repentance. <span
id="fr_2142"></span>[2143](#fn_2142) In this he sets forth what seemed
proper to him in regard to those who had fallen, and he describes the
classes of transgressions.

<span id="iii.xi.xlvi-p4"></span>2. There is extant also a private
letter on Repentance, which he wrote to Conon, <span
id="fr_2143"></span>[2144](#fn_2143) bishop of the parish of Hermopolis,
and another of an admonitory <span id="fr_2144"></span>[2145](#fn_2144)
character, to his flock at Alexandria. Among them also is the one
written to Origen on Martyrdom <span
id="fr_2145"></span>[2146](#fn_2145) and to the brethren at
Laodicea, <span id="fr_2146"></span>[2147](#fn_2146) of whom Thelymidres
was bishop. He likewise sent one on Repentance to the brethren in
Armenia, <span id="fr_2147"></span>[2148](#fn_2147) of whom Merozanes
was bishop.

<span id="iii.xi.xlvi-p10"></span>3. Besides all these, he wrote to
Cornelius of Rome, when he had received from him an epistle against
Novatus. <span id="fr_2148"></span>[2149](#fn_2148) He states in this
that he had been invited by Helenus, <span
id="fr_2149"></span>[2150](#fn_2149) bishop of Tarsus, in Cilicia, and
the others who were with him, Firmilianus, <span
id="fr_2150"></span>[2151](#fn_2150) bishop in Cappadocia, and
Theoctistus, <span id="fr_2151"></span>[2152](#fn_2151) of Palestine, to
meet them at the synod in Antioch, where some persons were endeavoring
to establish the schism of Novatus.

<span id="iii.xi.xlvi-p15"></span>4. Besides this he writes that he had
been informed that Fabius <span id="fr_2152"></span>[2153](#fn_2152) had
fallen asleep, and that Demetrianus <span
id="fr_2153"></span>[2154](#fn_2153) had been appointed his successor in
the episcopate of Antioch. He writes also in these words concerning the
bishop of Jerusalem: “For the blessed Alexander <span
id="fr_2154"></span>[2155](#fn_2154) having been confined in prison,
passed away happily.”

<span id="iii.xi.xlvi-p19"></span>5. In addition to this there is extant
also a certain other diaconal epistle of Dionysius, sent to those in
Rome through Hippolytus. <span id="fr_2155"></span>[2156](#fn_2155) And
he wrote <span id="page_292">p. 292</span> <span
id="iii.xi.xlvi-Page_292"></span>another to them on Peace, and likewise
on Repentance; <span id="fr_2156"></span>[2157](#fn_2156) and yet
another to the confessors there who still held to the opinion of
Novatus. <span id="fr_2157"></span>[2158](#fn_2157) He sent two more to
the same persons after they had returned to the Church. And he
communicated with many others by letters, which he has left behind him
as a benefit in various ways to those who now diligently study his
writings. <span id="fr_2158"></span>[2159](#fn_2158)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_2142"></span>[291:2143](2010216.htm#fr_2142) <span
id="iii.xi.xlvi-p2.2"></span>

<span id="iii.xi.xlvi-p3"></span> This epistle on the subject of
repentance or penance, which was the burning one just at this time in
connection with the lapsed, was doubtless written at about the same time
with those to Fabius and Novatian, already referred to. No fragments of
it have been preserved.

<span id="fn_2143"></span>[291:2144](2010216.htm#fr_2143) <span
id="iii.xi.xlvi-p4.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xi.xlvi-p5"></span> This work (<span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xi.xlvi-p5.1"></span>πρὸς Κόνωνα ἰδία τις περὶ μετανοίας
γραφή</span>), which was probably written at about this same time, is
mentioned also by Jerome (*de vir. ill.* 69). Eusebius preserves no
extract from it, but extended fragments have been preserved in various
<span class="c13"><span id="iii.xi.xlvi-p5.2"></span>mss.</span>, and
have been published by Pitra (*Spic. Solesm.* I. p. 15 sq.), though it
is questionable whether all that he gives are genuine. The translation
of Dionysius’ works in the *Ante-Nicene Fathers* omits all of these
fragments, though they are interesting and valuable. For further
particulars, see Dittrich, p. 62. The general character of the letter
must have been the same as that of the preceding.

<span id="fn_2144"></span>[291:2145](2010216.htm#fr_2144) <span
id="iii.xi.xlvi-p5.3"></span>

<span id="iii.xi.xlvi-p6"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xi.xlvi-p6.1"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xi.xlvi-p6.2"></span>πιστρεπτική</span>; literally, “calculated
to turn.” Musculus and Christophorsonus translate *hortatoria;*
Valesius, *objurgatoria;* Stroth and Closs, “Ermahnungsschrift”; Crusè,
“epistle of reproof.” The word does not necessarily carry the idea of
reproof with it, but it is natural to suppose in the present case that
it was written while Dionysius was absent from Alexandria, during the
persecution of Decius, and if so, may well have contained an admonition
to steadfastness, and at the same time, possibly, an argument against
rigoristic measures which some of the people may have been advocating in
reference to the lapsed. At least, the connection in which Eusebius
mentions it might lead us to think that it had something to do with that
question, though, as the epistle is no longer extant, we can reach no
certainty in the matter.

<span id="fn_2145"></span>[291:2146](2010216.htm#fr_2145) <span
id="iii.xi.xlvi-p6.3"></span>

<span id="iii.xi.xlvi-p7"></span> This epistle was doubtless written
while Origen was suffering imprisonment in the persecution of Decius
(see above, chap. 39, and below, p. 394), and was for the purpose of
comforting and encouraging him (cf. Origen’s own work on martyrdom,
referred to in chap. 28, above). The epistle is no longer extant.
Numerous fragments are given by Gallandi, Migne, and others, which they
assign to this work; but Dittrich has shown (p. 35 sq.) that they are to
be ascribed to some one else, perhaps to another Dionysius who lived
much later than the great bishop.

<span id="fn_2146"></span>[291:2147](2010216.htm#fr_2146) <span
id="iii.xi.xlvi-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xi.xlvi-p8"></span> This epistle to the Laodiceans, which
is no longer extant, very likely dealt, like so many of the others, with
the question of discipline. Of Thelymidres, bishop of Laodicea, we know
nothing.

<span id="fn_2147"></span>[291:2148](2010216.htm#fr_2147) <span
id="iii.xi.xlvi-p8.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xi.xlvi-p9"></span> We know no more about this epistle to
the Armenians than is told us here. The character of the letter must
have been similar to the two upon the same subject mentioned above. Of
the bishop Merozanes nothing is known.

<span id="fn_2148"></span>[291:2149](2010216.htm#fr_2148) <span
id="iii.xi.xlvi-p10.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xi.xlvi-p11"></span> On Cornelius, see above, chap. 39,
note. 3. His epistle to Dionysius is no longer extant. Dionysius’
epistle to him is likewise lost, and is known to us only from what
Eusebius tells us here. It was written after the death of Fabius of
Antioch (see below, §4), and therefore probably in 253 (see above, chap.
39, note 7). It has been questioned whether this synod of Antioch to
which, according to Eusebius, Dionysius referred, was really held, or
only projected. The *Libellus Synodicus* records it as an actual synod,
but its authority is of no weight. On the other hand, Eusebius’ words
seem plainly to indicate that he believed that the council was really
held, for he speaks of it as “*the* synod at Antioch”; had he thought of
it only as projected, he could hardly have referred to it in such
definite terms. In spite, therefore, of the doubts of Dittrich, Hefele,
and others, I am inclined to believe that Eusebius supposed that the
synod had actually been held in Antioch. Whether the epistle of
Dionysius warranted him in drawing that conclusion is another question,
which cannot be decided. I look upon it, however, as probable that, had
the synod been simply projected and failed to convene, some indication
of that fact would have been given by Dionysius, and would have caused a
modification of Eusebius’ statement.

<span id="fn_2149"></span>[291:2150](2010216.htm#fr_2149) <span
id="iii.xi.xlvi-p11.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xi.xlvi-p12"></span> Helenus, bishop of Tarsus, played a
prominent part in the controversy concerning the re-baptism of heretics,
maintaining, like most of the Oriental bishops, the necessity of
re-baptizing them (see below, Bk. VII. chap. 5), and also in the
controversy which arose about Paul of Samosata (see Bk. VII. chaps. 28
and 30). From the latter chapter we should gather that he presided at
the final council in Antioch, which passed condemnation upon Paul,
Firmilian, who seems to have presided at the previous councils, having
died on his way to the last one. Of Helenus’ dates we know only what we
can gather from the facts here stated. He must have been bishop as early
as 252; and he cannot have died until after 265 (on the date of the
Antiochian synod at which Paul was condemned, see Bk. VII. chap. 29,
note 1).

<span id="fn_2150"></span>[291:2151](2010216.htm#fr_2150) <span
id="iii.xi.xlvi-p12.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xi.xlvi-p13"></span> On Firmilian, see above, chap. 26,
note 3.

<span id="fn_2151"></span>[291:2152](2010216.htm#fr_2151) <span
id="iii.xi.xlvi-p13.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xi.xlvi-p14"></span> On Theoctistus, see above, chap. 19,
note 27.

<span id="fn_2152"></span>[291:2153](2010216.htm#fr_2152) <span
id="iii.xi.xlvi-p15.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xi.xlvi-p16"></span> On Fabius, bishop of Antioch, see
above, chap. 39, note 7.

<span id="fn_2153"></span>[291:2154](2010216.htm#fr_2153) <span
id="iii.xi.xlvi-p16.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xi.xlvi-p17"></span> Demetrianus, the successor of Fabius,
and predecessor of Paul in the bishopric of Antioch, is mentioned also
in Bk. VII. chaps. 5, 14, 27, and 30. The date of his accession is
uncertain; but as Fabius died probably in 253 (possibly in 252), we can
fix approximately the beginning of his episcopate. In Bk. VII. chaps. 5
and 14, he is said to have survived Gallienus’ edict of toleration (260
<span class="c13"><span id="iii.xi.xlvi-p17.1"></span>a.d.</span>); but
as Harnack has shown (*Zeit des Ignatius,* p. 51), this notice is quite
unreliable, as are also the notices in the *Chronicle.* We can only say
that his successor, Paul, became bishop between the years 257 and 260.

<span id="fn_2154"></span>[291:2155](2010216.htm#fr_2154) <span
id="iii.xi.xlvi-p17.2"></span>

<span id="iii.xi.xlvi-p18"></span> On Alexander, bishop of Jerusalem,
see above, chap. 8, note 6.

<span id="fn_2155"></span>[291:2156](2010216.htm#fr_2155) <span
id="iii.xi.xlvi-p19.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xi.xlvi-p20"></span> The interpretation of this sentence
is very difficult. The Greek runs <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xi.xlvi-p20.1"></span>ἑ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xi.xlvi-p20.2"></span>ξῆς ταύτῃ καὶ ἑτέρα τις ἐπιστολὴ τοῖς ἐν
῾Ρώμῃ τοῦ Διονυσίου φέρεται διακονικὴ διὰ ῾Ιππολύτου</span>. The <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.xi.xlvi-p20.3"></span>φέρεται</span>,
according to the usage of Eusebius, must mean “is extant,” and some
participle (e.g. “written” or “sent”) must then be supplied before <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.xi.xlvi-p20.4"></span>διὰ ῾Ιππολύτου</span>.
Whether Eusebius means that the letter was written by Hippolytus or was
carried by him to Rome cannot be determined. The latter is more probable
and is the commonly accepted interpretation. That Eusebius should name a
messenger in this particular case and in no other seems peculiar, unless
it be supposed that Hippolytus was so prominent a character as to merit
especial mention. Who he was we do not know, for chronology will not
permit us (as was formerly done by some scholars) to identify him with
the great writer of the Roman church (see above, chaps. 20 and 22), and
no other Hippolytus of prominence is known to us. In view of Eusebius’
mention of the name at this point, I am inclined, however, to think that
he, knowing so little about the Roman Hippolytus, fancied that this was
the same man. If he did, he had good reason to mention him. The word
“diaconal” (<span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xi.xlvi-p20.5"></span>διακονικὴ</span>) in this sentence has
caused much dispute. Rufinus translates *epistola de ministeriis;*
Valesius, *epistola de officio diaconi,* that is, “concerning the office
(or duties) of the diaconate,” and it seems out of the question to
understand the word in any other way. Why Dionysius should address an
epistle on this subject to the Roman church it is impossible to say.
Magistris supposed that it was called “diaconal” because it was to be
read in church by a deacon, and concluded that it was an exhortation to
peace, since it was customary for the deacons to offer the <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.xi.xlvi-p20.6"></span>εἰρηνικ€</span>, or
prayers for peace. The supposition is attractive, for it is natural to
think that this epistle, like the others, discussed the Novatian schism
and contained an exhortation to peace. But we cannot without further
evidence adopt Magistris’ explanation, nor indeed can we assume that a
diaconal epistle as such (whether the word is a technical one or not,
and though it might seem such we have no other trace of such a use of
it) had to do with the unity or peace of the Church. We must, in fact,
leave the matter quite undetermined. Compare Dittrich, *ibid.* p. 55.

<span id="fn_2156"></span>[292:2157](2010216.htm#fr_2156) <span
id="iii.xi.xlvi-p20.7"></span>

<span id="iii.xi.xlvi-p21"></span> Of these two epistles to the Romans
we know only the titles, as given here by Eusebius.

<span id="fn_2157"></span>[292:2158](2010216.htm#fr_2157) <span
id="iii.xi.xlvi-p21.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xi.xlvi-p22"></span> On these confessors, and their return
to the Church, see above, chap. 43, note 9. Dionysius’ epistles to them
are known to us only from Eusebius’ reference to them in this passage.

<span id="fn_2158"></span>[292:2159](2010216.htm#fr_2158) <span
id="iii.xi.xlvi-p22.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xi.xlvi-p23"></span> Besides the epistles mentioned by
Eusebius in this and the previous chapter we know at least the titles of
a number of others. In Bk. VII. many are referred to, and extracts from
some are quoted by Eusebius. See especially Bk. VII. chap. 26, where
another partial list of them is given. Eusebius does not pretend to
mention all of Dionysius’ epistles; indeed, he states that he wrote many
besides those mentioned. For further particulars in regard to all the
epistles known to us, see Dittrich’s monograph.
