<span id="iii.vi.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.vi.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII.—</span>*The Alleged Discrepancy
in the Gospels in regard to the Genealogy of Christ.*

<span id="iii.vi.vii-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.vi.vii-p2.1"></span>Matthew</span> and Luke in their gospels
have given us the genealogy of Christ differently, and many suppose that
they are at variance with one another. Since as a consequence every
believer, in ignorance of the truth, has been zealous to invent some
explanation which shall harmonize the two passages, permit us to subjoin
the account of the matter which has come down to us, <span
id="fr_106"></span>[107](#fn_106.md) and which is given by Africanus, who
was mentioned by us just above, in his epistle to Aristides, <span
id="fr_107"></span>[108](#fn_107.md) where he discusses the harmony of the
gospel genealogies. After refuting the opinions of others as forced and
deceptive, he give the account which he had received from
tradition <span id="fr_108"></span>[109](#fn_108.md) in these words:

<span id="iii.vi.vii-p8"></span>2. “For whereas the names of the
generations were reckoned in Israel either according to nature or
according to law;—according to nature by the succession of legitimate
offspring, and according to law whenever another raised up a child to
the name of a brother dying childless; <span
id="fr_109"></span>[110](#fn_109.md) for because a clear hope of
resurrection was not yet given they had a representation of the future
promise by a kind of mortal resurrection, in order that the name of the
one deceased might be perpetuated;—

<span id="iii.vi.vii-p10"></span>3. whereas then some of those who are
inserted in this genealogical table succeeded by natural descent, the
son to the father, while others, though born of one father, were
ascribed by name to another, mention was made of both of those who were
progenitors in fact and of those who were so only in name.

<span id="iii.vi.vii-p11"></span>4. Thus neither of the gospels is in
error, for one reckons by nature, the other by law. For the line of
descent from Solomon and that from Nathan <span
id="fr_110"></span>[111](#fn_110.md) were so involved, the one with the
other, by the raising up of children to the childless and by second
marriages, that the same persons are justly considered to belong at one
time to one, at another time to another; that is, at one time to the
reputed fathers, at another to the actual fathers. So that both these
accounts are strictly true and come down to Joseph with considerable
intricacy indeed, yet quite accurately.

<span id="iii.vi.vii-p13"></span>5. But in order that what I have said
may be made clear I shall explain the interchange of the generations. If
we reckon the generations from David through Solomon, the third from the
end is found to be Matthan, who begat Jacob the father of Joseph. But
if, with Luke, we reckon them from Nathan the son of David, in like
manner the third from the end is Melchi, <span
id="fr_111"></span>[112](#fn_111.md) whose son Eli was the father of
Joseph. For Joseph was the son of Eli, the son of Melchi.

<span id="iii.vi.vii-p15"></span>6. Joseph therefore being the object
proposed to us, it must be shown how it is that each is recorded to be
his father, both Jacob, who derived his descent from Solomon, and Eli,
who derived his from Nathan; first how it is that these two, Jacob and
Eli, were brothers, and then how it is that their fathers, Matthan and
Melchi, although of different families, are declared to be grandfathers
of Joseph.

<span id="iii.vi.vii-p16"></span>7. Matthan and Melchi having married in
succession the same woman, begat children who were uterine brothers, for
the law did not prohibit a widow, whether such by divorce or by the
death of her husband, from marrying another.

<span id="iii.vi.vii-p17"></span>8. By Estha <span
id="fr_112"></span>[113](#fn_112.md) then (for this was the woman’s name
according to tradition) Matthan, a descendant of Solomon, first begat
Jacob. <span id="page_92">p. 92</span> <span
id="iii.vi.vii-Page_92"></span>And when Matthan was dead, Melchi, who
traced his descent back to Nathan, being of the same tribe <span
id="fr_113"></span>[114](#fn_113.md) but of another family, <span
id="fr_114"></span>[115](#fn_114.md) married her as before said, and begat
a son Eli.

<span id="iii.vi.vii-p21"></span>9. Thus we shall find the two, Jacob
and Eli, although belonging to different families, yet brethren by the
same mother. Of these the one, Jacob, when his brother Eli had died
childless, took the latter’s wife and begat by her a son <span
id="fr_115"></span>[116](#fn_115.md) Joseph, his own son by nature <span
id="fr_116"></span>[117](#fn_116.md) and in accordance with reason.
Wherefore also it is written: ‘Jacob begat Joseph.’ <span
id="fr_117"></span>[118](#fn_117.md) But according to law <span
id="fr_118"></span>[119](#fn_118.md) he was the son of Eli, for Jacob,
being the brother of the latter, raised up seed to him.

<span id="iii.vi.vii-p26"></span>10. Hence the genealogy traced through
him will not be rendered void, which the evangelist Matthew in his
enumeration gives thus: ‘Jacob begat Joseph.’ But Luke, on the other
hand, says: ‘Who was the son, as was supposed’ <span
id="fr_119"></span>[120](#fn_119) (for this he also adds.md), ‘of Joseph,
the son of Eli, the son of Melchi’; for he could not more clearly
express the generation according to law. And the expression ‘he begat’
he has omitted in his genealogical table up to the end, tracing the
genealogy back to Adam the son of God. This interpretation is neither
incapable of proof nor is it an idle conjecture. <span
id="fr_120"></span>[121](#fn_120.md)

<span id="iii.vi.vii-p30"></span>11. For the relatives of our Lord
according to the flesh, whether with the desire of boasting or simply
wishing to state the fact, in either case truly, have handed down the
following account: <span id="fr_121"></span>[122](#fn_121.md) Some Idumean
robbers, <span id="fr_122"></span>[123](#fn_122.md) having attacked
Ascalon, a city of Palestine, carried away from a temple of Apollo which
stood near the walls, in addition to other booty, Antipater, son of a
certain temple slave named Herod. And since the priest <span
id="fr_123"></span>[124](#fn_123.md) was not able to pay the ransom for his
son, Antipater was brought up in the customs of the Idumeans, and
afterward was befriended by Hyrcanus, the high priest of the Jews.

<span id="iii.vi.vii-p34"></span>12. And having been sent by Hyrcanus on
an embassy to Pompey, and having restored to <span id="page_93">p.
93</span> <span id="iii.vi.vii-Page_93"></span>him the kingdom which had
been invaded by his brother Aristobulus, he had the good fortune to be
named procurator of Palestine. <span id="fr_124"></span>[125](#fn_124.md)
But Antipater having been slain by those who were envious of his great
good fortune <span id="fr_125"></span>[126](#fn_125.md) was succeeded by
his son Herod, who was afterward, by a decree of the senate, made King
of the Jews <span id="fr_126"></span>[127](#fn_126.md) under Antony and
Augustus. His sons were Herod and the other tetrarchs. <span
id="fr_127"></span>[128](#fn_127.md) These accounts agree also with those
of the Greeks. <span id="fr_128"></span>[129](#fn_128.md)

<span id="iii.vi.vii-p40"></span>13. But as there had been kept in the
archives <span id="fr_129"></span>[130](#fn_129.md) up to that time the
genealogies of the Hebrews as well as of those who traced their lineage
back to proselytes, <span id="fr_130"></span>[131](#fn_130.md) such as
Achior <span id="fr_131"></span>[132](#fn_131.md) the Ammonite and Ruth the
Moabitess, and to those who were mingled with the Israelites and came
out of Egypt with them, Herod, inasmuch as the lineage of the Israelites
contributed nothing to his advantage, and since he was goaded with the
consciousness of his own ignoble extraction, burned all the genealogical
records, <span id="fr_132"></span>[133](#fn_132.md) thinking that he might
appear of noble origin if no one else were able, from the public
registers, to trace back his lineage to the patriarchs or proselytes and
to those mingled with them, who were called Georae. <span
id="fr_133"></span>[134](#fn_133.md)

<span id="iii.vi.vii-p48"></span>14. A few of the careful, however,
having obtained private records of their own, either by remembering the
names or by getting them in some other way from the registers, pride
themselves on preserving the memory of their noble extraction. Among
these are those already mentioned, called Desposyni, <span
id="fr_134"></span>[135](#fn_134.md) on account of their connection with
the family of the Saviour. Coming from Nazara and Cochaba, <span
id="fr_135"></span>[136](#fn_135.md) villages of Judea, <span
id="fr_136"></span>[137](#fn_136.md) into other parts of the world, they
drew the aforesaid genealogy from memory <span
id="fr_137"></span>[138](#fn_137.md) and from the book of daily
records <span id="fr_138"></span>[139](#fn_138.md) as faithfully as
possible.

<span id="iii.vi.vii-p54"></span>15. Whether then the case stand thus or
not no one could find a clearer explanation, according to my own opinion
and that of every candid person. And let this suffice us, <span
id="page_94">p. 94</span> <span id="iii.vi.vii-Page_94"></span>for,
although we can urge no testimony in its support, <span
id="fr_139"></span>[140](#fn_139.md) we have nothing better or truer to
offer. In any case the Gospel states the truth.” And at the end of the
same epistle he adds these words: “Matthan, who was descended from
Solomon, begat Jacob. And when Matthan was dead, Melchi, who was
descended from Nathan begat Eli by the same woman. Eli and Jacob were
thus uterine brothers. Eli having died childless, Jacob raised up seed
to him, begetting Joseph, his own son by nature, but by law the son of
Eli. Thus Joseph was the son of both.”

<span id="iii.vi.vii-p56"></span>17. Thus far Africanus. And the lineage
of Joseph being thus traced, Mary also is virtually shown to be of the
same tribe with him, since, according to the law of Moses,
intermarriages between different tribes were not permitted. <span
id="fr_140"></span>[141](#fn_140.md) For the command is to marry one of the
same family <span id="fr_141"></span>[142](#fn_141.md) and lineage, <span
id="fr_142"></span>[143](#fn_142.md) so that the inheritance may not pass
from tribe to tribe. This may suffice here.

id="iii.vi.vii-p2.2"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.vii-p3"></span> “Over against the various opinions of
uninstructed apologists for the Gospel history, Eusebius introduces this
account of Africanus with the words, <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vi.vii-p3.1"></span>τὴν περὶ τούτων κατελθούσαν εὶς ἡμᾶς
ἱστορίαν</span>.” (Spitta.)

<span id="fn_107"></span>[91:108](2010034.htm#fr_107.md) <span
id="iii.vi.vii-p3.2"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.vii-p4"></span> On Africanus, see Bk. VI. chap. 31. Of
this Aristides to whom the epistle is addressed we know nothing. He must
not be confounded with the apologist Aristides, who lived in the reign
of Trajan (see below, Bk. IV. c. 3). Photius (*Bibl.* 34) mentions this
epistle, but tells us nothing about Aristides himself. The epistle
exists in numerous fragments, from which Spitta (*Der Brief des Julius
Africanus an Aristides kritisch untersucht und hergestellt,* Halle,
1877) attempts to reconstruct the original epistle. His work is the best
and most complete upon the subject. Compare Routh, *Rel. Sacræ,* II. pp.
228–237 and pp. 329–356, where two fragments are given and discussed at
length. The epistle (as given by Mai) is translated in the *Ante-Nicene
Fathers,* Am. ed. VI. p. 125 ff.

<span id="iii.vi.vii-p5"></span>The attempt of Africanus is, so far as
we know, the first critical attempt to harmonize the two genealogies of
Christ. The question had been the subject merely of guesses and
suppositions until his time. He approaches the matter in a free critical
spirit (such as seems always to have characterized him), and his
investigations therefore deserve attention. He holds that both
genealogies are those of Joseph, and this was the unanimous opinion of
antiquity, though, as he says, the discrepancies were reconciled in
various ways. Africanus himself, as will be seen, explains by the law of
Levirate marriages, and his view is advocated by Mill (*On the Mythical
Interpretation of the Gospel,* p. 201 sq.); but of this interpretation
Rev. John Lightfoot justly says, “There is neither reason for it, nor,
indeed, any foundation at all.”

<span id="iii.vi.vii-p6"></span>Upon the supposition that both
genealogies relate to Joseph the best explanation is that Matthew’s
table represents the royal line of legal successors to the throne of
David, while Luke’s gives the line of actual descent. This view is ably
advocated by Hervey in Smith’s *Bible Dictionary* (article *Genealogy of
Jesus*). Another opinion which has prevailed widely since the
Reformation is that Luke gives the genealogy of Mary. The view is
defended very ingeniously by Weiss (*Leben Jesu,* I. 205, 2d edition).
For further particulars see, besides the works already mentioned, the
various commentaries upon Matthew and Luke and the various lives of
Christ, especially Andrews’, p. 55 sq.

<span id="fn_108"></span>[91:109](2010034.htm#fr_108.md) <span
id="iii.vi.vii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.vii-p7"></span> Eusebius makes a mistake in saying that
Africanus had received the explanation which follows from tradition. For
Africanus himself says expressly (§15, below) that his interpretation is
not supported by testimony. Eusebius’ error has been repeated by most
writers upon the subject, but is exposed by Spitta, *ibid.* p. 63.

<span id="fn_109"></span>[91:110](2010034.htm#fr_109.md) <span
id="iii.vi.vii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.vii-p9"></span> The law is stated in <span

sq.

<span id="fn_110"></span>[91:111](2010034.htm#fr_110.md) <span
id="iii.vi.vii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.vii-p12"></span> Nathan was a son of David and
Bathsheba, and therefore own brother of Solomon.

<span id="fn_111"></span>[91:112](2010034.htm#fr_111.md) <span
id="iii.vi.vii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.vii-p14"></span> Melchi, who is here given as the third
from the end, is in our present texts of Luke the fifth ([Luke iii.
24](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#024.md)<span
id="iii.vi.vii-p14.1"></span>), Matthat and Levi standing between Melchi
and Eli. It is highly probable that the text which Africanus followed
omitted the two names Matthat and Levi (see Westcott and Hort’s Greek
Testament, Appendix, p. 57). It is impossible to suppose that Africanus
in such an investigation as this could have overlooked two names by
mistake if they had stood in his text of the Gospels.

<span id="fn_112"></span>[91:113](2010034.htm#fr_112.md) <span
id="iii.vi.vii-p17.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.vii-p18"></span> We know nothing more of Estha.
Africanus probably refers to the tradition handed down by the relatives
of Christ, who had, as he says, preserved genealogies which agreed with
those of the Gospels. He distinguishes here what he gives on tradition
from his own interpretation of the Gospel discrepancy upon which he is
engaged.

<span id="iii.vi.vii-p20"></span> <span class="Greek"><span

class="Greek"><span id="iii.vi.vii-p20.2"></span>γένος</span> is used to
denote *family.* Matthan and Melchi were of different families, but both
belonged to the same Davidic race which was divided into two families,
that of Solomon and that of Nathan” (Valesius).

<span id="fn_115"></span>[92:116](2010034.htm#fr_115.md) <span
id="iii.vi.vii-p21.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.vii-p22"></span> All the <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.vi.vii-p22.1"></span>mss.</span>, and editions of Eusebius read
<span class="Greek"><span id="iii.vi.vii-p22.2"></span>τρίτον</span>
instead of <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vi.vii-p22.3"></span>ὑ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vi.vii-p22.4"></span>ιόν</span> here. But it is very difficult
to make any sense out of the word <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vi.vii-p22.5"></span>τρίτον</span> in this connection. We
therefore prefer to follow Spitta (see *ibid.* pp. 87 sqq.) in reading
<span class="Greek"><span id="iii.vi.vii-p22.6"></span>ὑ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.vi.vii-p22.7"></span>ιόν</span> instead of
<span class="Greek"><span id="iii.vi.vii-p22.8"></span>τρίτον</span>, an
emendation which he has ventured to make upon the authority of Rufinus,
who translates “genuit Joseph filium suum,” showing no trace of a <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.vi.vii-p22.9"></span>τρίτον</span>. The word
<span class="Greek"><span id="iii.vi.vii-p22.10"></span>τρίτον</span> is
wanting also in three late Catenæ which contain the fragments of
Africanus’ Epistle (compare Spitta, *ibid.* p. 117, note 12).

<span id="fn_116"></span>[92:117](2010034.htm#fr_116.md) <span
id="iii.vi.vii-p22.11"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.vii-p23"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vi.vii-p23.1"></span>κατὰ λόγον</span>. These words have caused
translators and commentators great difficulty, and most of them seem to
have missed their significance entirely. Spitta proposes to alter by
reading <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vi.vii-p23.2"></span>κατ€λογον</span>, but the emendation is
unnecessary. The remarks which he makes (p. 89 sqq.) upon the relation
between this sentence and the next are, however, excellent. It was
necessary to Africanus’ theory that Joseph should be allowed to trace
his lineage through Jacob, his father “by nature,” as well as through
Eli, his father “by law,” and hence the words <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vi.vii-p23.3"></span>κατὰ λόγον</span> are added and emphasized.
He was his son by nature and therefore “rightfully to be reckoned as his
son.” This explains the Biblical quotation which follows:
“Wherefore”—because he was Jacob’s son by nature and could rightfully be
reckoned in his line, and not only in the line of Eli—“it is written,”
&c.

id="iii.vi.vii-p26.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.vii-p27"></span> This passage has caused much trouble.
Valesius remarks, “Africanus wishes to refer the words <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.vi.vii-p27.1"></span>ὡ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.vi.vii-p27.2"></span>ς</span> <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.vi.vii-p27.3"></span>ἐνομίζετο</span> (‘as
was supposed’) not only to the words <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vi.vii-p27.4"></span>ὑ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vi.vii-p27.5"></span>ιὸς ᾽Ιωσήφ</span>, but also to the words
<span class="Greek"><span id="iii.vi.vii-p27.6"></span>τοῦ ῾Ηλὶ</span>,
which follow, which although it is acute is nevertheless improper and
foolish; for if Luke indicates that legal generation or adoption by the
words <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vi.vii-p27.7"></span>ὡ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vi.vii-p27.8"></span>ς</span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vi.vii-p27.9"></span>ἐνομίζετο</span>, as Africanus claims, it
would follow that Christ was the son of Joseph by legal adoption in the
same way that Joseph was the son of Eli. And thus it would be said that
Mary, after the death of Joseph, married his brother, and that Christ
was begotten by him, which is impious and absurd. And besides, if these
words, <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vi.vii-p27.10"></span>ὡ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vi.vii-p27.11"></span>ς</span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vi.vii-p27.12"></span>ἐνομίζετο</span>, are extended to the
words <span class="Greek"><span id="iii.vi.vii-p27.13"></span>τοῦ
῾Ηλὶ</span>, in the same way they can be extended to all which follow.
For there is no reason why they should be supplied in the second grade
and not in the others.”

<span id="iii.vi.vii-p28"></span>But against Valesius, Stroth says that
Africanus seeks nothing in the words <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vi.vii-p28.1"></span>ὡ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vi.vii-p28.2"></span>ς</span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vi.vii-p28.3"></span>ἐνομίζετο</span>, but in the fact that Luke
says “he was the son of,” while Matthew says “he begat.” Stroth’s
interpretation is followed by Closs, Heinichen, and others, but Routh
follows Valesius. Spitta discusses the matter carefully (p. 91 sq.),
agreeing with Valesius that Africanus lays the emphasis upon the words
<span class="Greek"><span id="iii.vi.vii-p28.4"></span>ὡ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.vi.vii-p28.5"></span>ς</span> <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.vi.vii-p28.6"></span>ἐνομίζετο</span>, but
by an emendation (introducing a second <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vi.vii-p28.7"></span>ὡ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vi.vii-p28.8"></span>ς</span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vi.vii-p28.9"></span>ἐνομίζετο</span>, and reading “who was the
son, as was supposed, of Joseph, the son of Jacob, who was himself also
the son, as was supposed,—for this he also adds,—of Eli, the son of
Melchi”) he applies the <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vi.vii-p28.10"></span>ὡ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vi.vii-p28.11"></span>ς</span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vi.vii-p28.12"></span>ἐνομίζετο</span> only to the first and
second members, and takes it in a more general sense to cover both
cases, thus escaping Valesius’ conclusions expressed above. The
conjecture is ingenious, but is unwarranted and unnecessary. The words
which occur in the next sentence, “and the expression, ‘he begat’ he has
omitted,” show that Africanus, as Stroth contends, lays the emphasis
upon the difference of form in the two genealogies, “Son of” and “he
begat.” The best explanation seems to me to be that Africanus supposes
Luke to have implied the legal generation in the words “the Son of,”
used in distinction from the definite expression “he begat,” and that
the words <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vi.vii-p28.13"></span>ὡ</span><span class="Greek"><span

id="iii.vi.vii-p28.15"></span>ἐνομίζετο</span>, which “he also adds,”
simply emphasize this difference of expression by introducing a still
greater ambiguity into Luke’s mode of statement. He not only uses the
words, the “Son of,” which have a wide latitude, admitting *any* kind of
sonship, but “he also adds,” “as was supposed,” showing, in Africanus’
opinion, still more clearly that the list which follows is far from
being a closely defined table of descent by “natural generation.”

id="iii.vi.vii-p28.16"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.vii-p29"></span> This seems the best possible rendering
of the Greek, which reads <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vi.vii-p29.1"></span>τὴν ἀναφορὰν ποιησ€μενος ἑ& 240·ς τοῦ
᾽Αδὰμ, τοῦ θεοῦ κατ᾽ ἀν€λυσιν. οὐδὲ μὴν ἀναπόδεικτον κ.τ.λ</span>.,
which is very dark, punctuated thus, and it is difficult to understand
what is meant by <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vi.vii-p29.2"></span>κατ᾽ ἀν€λυσιν</span> in connection with the
preceding words. (Crusè translates, “having traced it back as far as
Adam, ‘who was the son of God,’ he resolves the whole series by
referring back to God. Neither is this incapable of proof, nor is it an
idle conjecture.”) The objections which Spitta brings against the
sentence in this form are well founded. He contends (p. 63 sqq.), and
that rightly, that Africanus could not have written the sentence thus.
In restoring the original epistle of Africanus, therefore, he throws the
words <span class="Greek"><span id="iii.vi.vii-p29.3"></span>κατ᾽
ἀν€λυσιν</span> into the next sentence, which disposes of the
difficulty, and makes good sense. We should then read, “having traced it
back as far as Adam, the Son of God. This interpretation (more
literally, ‘as an interpretation,’ or ‘by way of interpretation’) is
neither incapable of proof, nor is it an idle conjecture.” That
Africanus wrote thus I am convinced. But as Spitta shows, Eusebius must
have divided the sentences as they now stand, for, according to his
idea, that Africanus’ account was one which he had received by
tradition, the other mode of reading would be incomprehensible, though
he probably did not understand much better the meaning of <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.vi.vii-p29.4"></span>κατ᾽ ἀν€λυσιν</span> as
he placed it. In translating Africanus’ epistle here, I have felt
justified in rendering it as Africanus probably wrote it, instead of
following Eusebius’ incorrect reproduction of it.

<span id="fn_121"></span>[92:122](2010034.htm#fr_121.md) <span
id="iii.vi.vii-p30.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.vii-p31"></span> The Greek reads: <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.vi.vii-p31.1"></span>παρέδοσαν καὶ
τοῦτο</span>, “have handed down *also.*” The <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vi.vii-p31.2"></span>καὶ</span> occurs in all the <span
class="c13"><span id="iii.vi.vii-p31.3"></span>mss.</span> and versions
of Eusebius, and was undoubtedly written by him, but Spitta supposes it
an addition of Eusebius, caused, like the change in the previous
sentence, by his erroneous conception of the nature of Africanus’
interpretation. The <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vi.vii-p31.4"></span>καὶ</span> is certainly troublesome if we
suppose that all that precedes is Africanus’ own interpretation of the
Biblical lists, and not a traditional account handed down by the
“relatives of our Lord”; and this, in spite of Eusebius’ belief, we must
certainly insist upon. We may therefore assume with Spitta that the
<span class="Greek"><span id="iii.vi.vii-p31.5"></span>καὶ</span> did
not stand in the original epistle as Africanus wrote it. The question
arises, if what precedes is not given upon the authority of the
“relatives of our Lord,” why then is this account introduced upon their
testimony, as if confirming the preceding? We may simply refer again to
Africanus’ words at the end of the extract (§15 below) to prove that his
interpretation did not rest upon testimony, and then we may answer with
Spitta that their testimony, which is appealed to in §14 below, was to
the genealogies themselves, and in this Africanus wishes it to be known
that they confirmed the Gospel lists.

upon the authority of Rufinus and the author of the Syriac version, both
of whom reproduce the word (cf. Spitta, p. 99 sq.). Africanus certainly
supposed that Herod destroyed *all* the genealogical records, and not
simply those of the true Jews.

<span id="iii.vi.vii-p45"></span>This account of the burning of the
records given by Africanus is contradicted by history, for we learn from
Josephus, *De Vita,* §1, that he drew his own lineage from the public
records, which were therefore still in existence more than half a
century after the time at which Herod is said to have utterly destroyed
them. It is significant that Rufinus translates *omnes Hebræorum
generationes descriptæ in Archivis templi secretioribus habebantur.*

<span id="iii.vi.vii-p46"></span>How old this tradition was we do not
know; Africanus is the sole extant witness of it.

<span id="iii.vi.vii-p50"></span> Cochaba, according to Epiphanius
(*Hær.* XXX. 2 and 16), was a village in Basanitide near Decapolis. It
is noticeable that this region was the seat of Ebionism. There may
therefore be significance in the care with which these *Desposyni*
preserved the genealogy of Joseph, for the Ebionites believed that
Christ was the real son of Joseph, and therefore Joseph’s lineage was
his.

<span id="iii.vi.vii-p51"></span> “Judea” is here used in the wider
sense of Palestine as a whole, including the country both east and west
of the Jordan. The word is occasionally used in this sense in Josephus;
and so in [Matt. 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#001.md), [Mark
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#001.md)<span
id="iii.vi.vii-p51.1"></span>[Mark x.
1](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#001.md)<span id="iii.vi.vii-p51.2"></span>,
we read of “the coasts of Judea beyond Jordan.” Ptolemy, Dion Cassius,
and Strabo habitually employ the word in the wide sense.

<span id="iii.vi.vii-p52"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vi.vii-p52.1"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vi.vii-p52.2"></span>κ μνήμης</span>. These words are not found
in any extant <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.vi.vii-p52.3"></span>mss.</span>, but I have followed Stroth and
others in supplying them for the following reasons. The Greek, as we
have it, runs: <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vi.vii-p52.4"></span>καὶ τὴν προκειμένην γενεαλογίαν žκ τε τῆς
βίβλου τῶν ἡμερῶν κ.τ.λ</span>. The particle <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vi.vii-p52.5"></span>τε</span> indicates plainly that some
phrase has fallen out. Rufinus translates *ordinem supra dictæ
generationis partim memoriter partim etiam ex dierum libris in quantum
erat perdocebant.* The words *partim memoriter* find no equivalent in
the Greek as we have it, but the particle <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vi.vii-p52.6"></span>τε</span>, which still remains, shows that
words which Rufinus translated thus must have stood originally in the
Greek. The Syriac version also confirms the conclusion that something
stood in the original which has since disappeared, though the rendering
which it gives rests evidently upon a corrupt text (cf. Spitta, p. 101).
Valesius suggests the insertion of <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vi.vii-p52.7"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vi.vii-p52.8"></span>πὸ μνήμης</span>, though he does not place
the phrase in his text. Heinichen supplies <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vi.vii-p52.9"></span>μνημονεύσαντες</span>, and is followed by
Closs in his translation. Stroth, Migne, Routh, and Spitta read <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.vi.vii-p52.10"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.vi.vii-p52.11"></span>κ μνήμης</span>. The
sense is essentially the same in each case.

<span id="fn_138"></span>[93:139](2010034.htm#fr_138.md) <span
id="iii.vi.vii-p52.12"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.vii-p53"></span> It has been the custom since Valesius,
to consider this “Book of daily records” (<span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vi.vii-p53.1"></span>βίβλος τῶν ἡμερῶν</span>) the same as the
“private records” (<span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vi.vii-p53.2"></span>ἰ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vi.vii-p53.3"></span>διωτικὰς ἀπογραφ€ς</span>) mentioned just
above. But this opinion has been combated by Spitta, and that with
perfect right. The sentence is, in fact, an exact parallel to the
sentence just above, where it is said that a few of the careful, either
by means of their memory or by means of copies, were able to have
“private records of their own.” In the present sentence it is said that
“they drew the *aforesaid genealogy* (viz., ‘the private records of
their own’) from memory, or from the *Book of daily records*” (which
corresponds to the *copies* referred to above). This book of daily
records is clearly, therefore, something other than the <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.vi.vii-p53.4"></span>ἰ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.vi.vii-p53.5"></span>διωτικὰς
ἀπογραφὰς</span>, but exactly what we are to understand by it is not so
easy to say. It cannot denote the regular public records (called the
archives above), for these were completed, and would not need to be
supplemented by memory; and apparently, according to Africanus’ opinion,
these private records were made after the destruction of the regular
public ones. The “Book of daily records” referred to must have been at
any rate an incomplete genealogical source needing to be supplemented by
the memory. Private family record books, if such existed previous to the
supposed destruction of the public records, of which we have no
evidence, would in all probability have been complete for each family.
Spitta maintains (p. 101 sq.) that the Book of Chronicles is meant: the
Hebrew <span class="Hebrew"><span id="iii.vi.vii-p53.6"></span>דִּבְרֵי
הַיָּמִים </span>, *words or records of the days.* This is a very
attractive suggestion, as the book exactly corresponds to the book
described: the genealogies which it gives are incomplete and require
supplementing, and it is a book which was accessible to all; public,
therefore, and yet not involved in the supposed destruction. The
difficulty lies in the name given. It is true that Jerome calls the
Books of Chronicles *Verba Dierum* and Hilary *Sermones Dierum,* &c.;
but we should expect Africanus to use here the technical LXX.
designation, <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vi.vii-p53.7"></span>Παραλειπομένων</span>. But whatever this
“Book of daily records” was, it cannot have been the “private records”
which were formed “from memory and from copies,” but was one of the
sources from which those “private records” were drawn.

<span id="fn_139"></span>[94:140](2010034.htm#fr_139.md) <span
id="iii.vi.vii-p54.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.vii-p55"></span> Compare note 3, above. Africanus’
direct statement shows clearly enough that he does not rest his
interpretation of the genealogies (an interpretation which is purely a
result of Biblical study) upon the testimony of the relatives of the
Saviour. Their testimony is invoked with quite a different purpose,
namely, in confirmation of the genealogies themselves, and the long
story (upon the supposition that their testimony is invoked in support
of Africanus’ *interpretation,* introduced absolutely without sense and
reason) thus has its proper place, in showing how the “relatives of the
Saviour” were in a position to be competent witnesses upon this question
of fact (not *interpretation*), in spite of the burning of the public
records by Herod.

<span id="iii.vi.vii-p57"></span> The law to which Eusebius refers is
recorded in <span id="iii.vi.vii-p57.1"></span>[Num.

[7](../../../bib/kjv/num036.htm#007.md)<span id="iii.vi.vii-p57.2"></span>.
But the prohibition given there was not an absolute and universal one,
but a prohibition which concerned only heiresses, who were not to marry
out of their own tribe upon penalty of forfeiting their inheritance (cf.
Josephus, *Ant.* IV. 7. 5). It is an instance of the limited nature of
the law that Mary and Elizabeth were relatives, although Joseph and Mary
belonged to the tribe of Judah, and Zacharias, at least, was a Levite.
This example lay so near at hand that Eusebius should not have
overlooked it in making his assertion. His argument, therefore in proof
of the fact that Mary belonged to the tribe of Judah has no force, but
the fact itself is abundantly established both by the unanimous
tradition of antiquity (independent of Luke’s genealogy, which was
universally supposed to be that of Joseph), and by such passages as
