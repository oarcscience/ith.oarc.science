<span id="iii.ix.x-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.ix.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter X.—</span>*The Bishops of Rome and of
Alexandria during the Reign of Antoninus*.

<span id="iii.ix.x-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.ix.x-p2.1"></span>Adrian</span> having died after a reign of
twenty-one years, <span id="fr_1058"></span>[1059](#fn_1058.md) was
succeeded in the government of the Romans by Antoninus, called the
Pious. In the first year of his reign Telesphorus <span
id="fr_1059"></span>[1060](#fn_1059.md) died in the eleventh year of his
episcopate, and Hyginus became bishop of Rome. <span
id="fr_1060"></span>[1061](#fn_1060.md) Irenæus records that Telesphorus’
death was made glorious by martyrdom, <span
id="fr_1061"></span>[1062](#fn_1061.md) and in the same connection he
states that in the time of the above-mentioned Roman bishop Hyginus,
Valentinus, the founder of a sect of his own, and Cerdon, the author of
Marcion’s error, were both well known at Rome. <span
id="fr_1062"></span>[1063](#fn_1062.md) He writes as follows: <span

<span id="iii.ix.x-p3"></span> Hadrian reigned from Aug. 8, 117, to July
10, 138 <span class="c13"><span id="iii.ix.x-p3.1"></span>a.d.</span>

<span id="iii.ix.x-p4"></span> On Telesphorus, see above, chap. 5, note
13. The date given here by Eusebius (138–139 <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.ix.x-p4.1"></span>a.d.</span>) is probably (as remarked there)
at least a year too late.

<span id="fn_1060"></span>[182:1061](2010119.htm#fr_1060.md) <span
id="iii.ix.x-p4.2"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.x-p5"></span> We know very little about Hyginus. His
dates can be fixed with tolerable certainty as 137–141, the duration of
his episcopate being four years, as Eusebius states in the next chapter.
See Lipsius’ *Chron. d. röm. Bischöfe,* p. 169 and 263. The Roman
martyrologies make him a martyr, but this means nothing, as the early
bishops of Rome almost without exception are called martyrs by these
documents. The forged decretals ascribe to him the introduction of a
number of ecclesiastical rites.

<span id="fn_1061"></span>[182:1062](2010119.htm#fr_1061.md) <span
id="iii.ix.x-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.x-p6"></span> In his *Adv. Hær.* III. 3. 3. The
testimony of Irenæus rests upon Roman tradition at this point, and is
undoubtedly reliable. Telesphorus is the first Roman bishop whom we know
to have suffered martyrdom, although the Roman Catholic Church
celebrates as martyrs all the so-called popes down to the fourth
century.

the next chapter.
