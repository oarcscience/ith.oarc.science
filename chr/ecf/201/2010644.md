id="iv.vi.iv.lviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter LVIII</span>.—*Concerning the
Building of a Church in Honor of the Apostles at Constantinople.*

<span id="iv.vi.iv.lviii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.lviii-p2.1"></span>After</span> this he proceeded to erect
a church in memory of the apostles, in the city which bears his name.
This building he carried to a vast height, and brilliantly decorated by
encasing it from the foundation to the roof with marble slabs of various
colors. He also formed the inner roof of finely fretted work, and
overlaid it throughout with gold. The external covering, which protected
the building from the rain, was of brass instead of tiles; and this too
was splendidly and profusely adorned with gold, and reflected the sun’s
rays with a brilliancy which dazzled the distant beholder. The dome was
entirely encompassed by a finely carved tracery, wrought in brass and
gold.
