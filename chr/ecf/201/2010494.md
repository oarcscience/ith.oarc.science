id="iv.vi.ii.xlix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLIX</span>.—*Concerning
Constantine’s Pious Father, and the Persecutors Diocletian and
Maximian.*

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xlix-p2"></span>“<span class="c13"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.xlix-p2.1"></span>The</span> former emperors I have been
accustomed to regard as those with whom I could have no sympathy, <span
id="fr_3196"></span>[3197](#fn_3196.md) on account of the savage cruelty of
their character. Indeed, my father was the only one who uniformly
practiced the duties of humanity, and with admirable piety called for
the blessing of God the Father on all his actions, but the rest, unsound
in mind, were more zealous of cruel than gentle measures; and this
disposition they indulged without restraint, and thus persecuted the
true doctrine during the whole period of their reign. Nay, so violent
did their malicious fury become, that in the midst of a profound peace,
as regards both the religious and ordinary interests of men, they
kindled, as it were, the flames of a civil war. <span

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xlix-p3"></span> The word means “having no share
with,” and sometimes “disinherited.” It may perhaps mean, “I have been
accustomed to think of the former emperors as having been deprived of
their possessions on account,” &c.

with its attendant horrors, being the act, not of foreign enemies, but
of their countrymen and fellow-citizens.—*Bag.*\]
