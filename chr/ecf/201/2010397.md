<span id="iv.vi.i.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII</span>.—*That like Moses, he
was reared in the Palaces of Kings.*

<span id="iv.vi.i.xii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.xii-p2.1"></span>Ancient</span> history relates that a cruel
race of tyrants oppressed the Hebrew nation; and that God, who
graciously regarded them in their affliction, provided that the prophet
Moses, who was then an infant, should be brought up in the very palaces
and bosoms of the oppressors, and instructed in all the wisdom they
possessed. And when in the course of time he had arrived at manhood, and
the time was come for Divine justice to avenge the wrongs of the
afflicted people, then the prophet of God, in obedience to the will of a
more powerful Lord, forsook the royal household, and, estranging himself
in word and deed from the tyrants by whom he had been brought up, openly
acknowledging his true brethren and kinsfolk. Then God, exalting him to
be the leader of the whole nation, delivered the Hebrews from the
bondage of their enemies, and inflicted Divine vengeance through his
means on the tyrant race. This ancient story, though rejected by most as
fabulous, has reached the ears of all. But now the same God has given to
us to be eye-witnesses of miracles more wonderful than fables, and, from
their recent appearance, more authentic than any report. For the tyrants
of our day have ventured to war against the Supreme God, and have sorely
afflicted His Church. <span id="fr_3074"></span>[3075](#fn_3074.md) And in
the midst of these, Constantine, who was shortly to become their
destroyer, but at that time of tender age, and blooming with the down of
early youth, dwelt, as that other servant of God had done, in the very
home of the tyrants, <span id="fr_3075"></span>[3076](#fn_3075.md) but
young as he was did not share the manner of life of the ungodly: for
from that early period his noble nature, under the leading of the Divine
Spirit, inclined him to piety and a life acceptable to God. A desire,
moreover, to emulate the example of his father had its influence in
stimulating the son to a virtuous course of conduct. His father was
Constantius <span id="fr_3076"></span>[3077](#fn_3076.md) (and we ought to
revive his memory at this time), the most illustrious emperor of our
age; of whose life it is necessary briefly to relate a few particulars,
which tell to the honor of his son.
