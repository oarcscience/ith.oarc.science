<span id="iv.vi.iv.xxv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.xxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXV</span>.—*Prohibition of
Sacrifices, of Mystic Rites, Combats of Gladiators, also the Licentious
Worship of the Nile.*

<span id="iv.vi.iv.xxv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.xxv-p2.1"></span>Consistently</span> with this zeal he
issued successive laws and ordinances, forbidding any to offer sacrifice
to idols, to consult diviners, to erect images, or to pollute the cities
with the sanguinary combats of gladiators. <span

especially those of Alexandria, had been accustomed to honor their river
through a priesthood composed of effeminate men, a further law was
passed commanding the extermination of the whole class as vicious, that
no one might thenceforward be found tainted with the like impurity. And
whereas the superstitious inhabitants apprehended that the river would
in consequence withhold its customary flood, God himself showed his
approval of the emperor’s law by ordering all things in a manner quite
contrary to their expectation. For those who had defiled the cities by
their vicious conduct were indeed seen no more; but the river, as if the
country through which it flowed had been purified to receive it, rose
higher than ever before, and completely overflowed the country with its
fertilizing streams: thus effectually admonishing the deluded people to
turn from impure men, and ascribe their prosperity to him alone who is
the Giver of all good.

getting a glimpse of the legislation of Constantine in these and similar
regards is the section, *The alteration in general and penal
legislation* in Wordsworth’s Constantinus I., in Smith and Wace, *Dict.*
1 (1877). This section is on p. 636–7. Compare also the laws themselves
as gathered in Migne, *Patrol. lat*. vol. 8. Compare also Prolegomena
for general statement of the value of his legislation and his reputation
as legislator.
