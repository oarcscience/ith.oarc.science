<span id="iv.viii.xvi"></span>

<span id="iv.viii.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.viii.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XV.</span>

<span id="iv.viii.xvi-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iv.viii.xvi-p2.1"></span>What</span> now remains, but to account for
those which are the crowning facts of all; I mean his death, so far and
widely known, the manner of his passion, and the mighty miracle of his
resurrection after death: and then to establish the truth of these
events by the clearest testimonies?

<span id="iv.viii.xvi-p3"></span>2. For the reasons detailed above he
used the instrumentality of a mortal body, as a figure becoming his
Divine majesty, and like a mighty sovereign employed it as his
interpreter in his intercourse with men, performing all things
consistently with his own Divine power. Supposing, then, at the end of
his sojourn among men, he had by any other means suddenly withdrawn
himself from their sight, and, secretly removing that interpreter of
himself, the form which he had assumed, had hastened to flee from death,
and afterwards by his own act had consigned his mortal body to
corruption and dissolution: doubtless in such a case he would have been
deemed a mere phantom by all. Nor would he have acted in a manner worthy
of himself, had he who is Life, the Word, and the Power of God,
abandoned this interpreter of himself to corruption and death.

<span id="iv.viii.xvi-p4"></span>3. Nor, again, would his warfare with
the spirits of evil have received its consummation by conflict with the
power of death. The place of his retirement must have remained unknown;
nor would his existence have been believed by those who had not seen him
for themselves. No proof would have been given that he was superior to
death nor would he have delivered mortality from the law of its natural
infirmity. His name had never been heard throughout the world nor could
he have inspired his disciples with contempt of death, or encouraged
those who embraced his doctrine to hope for the enjoyment of a future
life with God. Nor would he have fulfilled the assurances of his own
promise, nor have accomplished the predictions of the prophets
concerning himself. Nor would he have undergone the last conflict of
all; for this was to be the struggle with the power of death.

<span id="iv.viii.xvi-p5"></span>4. For all these reasons, then, and
inasmuch as it was necessary that the mortal body which had rendered
such service to the Divine Word should meet with an end worthy its
sacred occupant, the manner of his death was ordained accordingly. For
since but two alternatives remained: either to consign his body entirely
to corruption, and so to bring the scene of life to a dishonored close,
or else to prove himself victorious over death, and render mortality
immortal by the act of Divine power; the former of these alternatives
would have contravened his own promise. For as it is not the property of
fire to cool, nor of light to darken, no more is it compatible with
life, to deprive of life, or with Divine intelligence, to act in a
manner contrary to reason. For how would it be consistent, with reason,
that he who had promised <span id="page_605">p. 605</span> <span
id="iv.viii.xvi-Page_605"></span>life to others, should permit his own
body, the form which he had chosen, to perish beneath the power of
corruption? That he who had inspired his disciples with hopes of
immortality, should yield this exponent of his Divine counsels to be
destroyed by death?

<span id="iv.viii.xvi-p6"></span>5. The second alternative was therefore
needful: I mean, that he should assert his dominion over the power of
death. But how? should this be a furtive and secret act, or openly
performed and in the sight of all? So mighty an achievement, had it
remained unknown and unrevealed, must have failed of its effect as
regards the interests of men; whereas the same event, if openly declared
and understood, would, from its wondrous character, redound to the
common benefit of all. With reason, therefore, since it was needful to
prove his body victorious over death, and that not secretly but before
the eyes of men, he shrank not from the trial, for this indeed would
have argued fear, and a sense of inferiority to the power of death, but
maintained that conflict with the enemy which has rendered mortality
immortal; a conflict undertaken for the life, the immortality, the
salvation of all.

<span id="iv.viii.xvi-p7"></span>6. Suppose one desired to show us that
a vessel could resist the force of fire; how could he better prove the
fact than by casting it into the furnace and thence withdrawing it
entire and unconsumed? Even thus the Word of God who is the source of
life to all, desiring to prove the triumph of that body over death which
he had assumed for man’s salvation, and to make this body partake his
own life and immortality, pursued a course consistent with this object.
Leaving his body for a little while, <span
id="fr_3570"></span>[3571](#fn_3570.md) and delivering it up to death in
proof of its mortal nature, he soon redeemed it from death, in
vindication of that Divine power whereby he has manifested the
immortality which he has promised to be utterly beyond the sphere of
death.

<span id="iv.viii.xvi-p9"></span>7. The reason of this is clear. It was
needful that his disciples should receive ocular proof of the certainty
of that resurrection on which he had taught them to rest their hopes as
a motive for rising superior to the fear of death. It was indeed most
needful that they who purposed to pursue a life of godliness should
receive a clear impression of this essential truth: more needful still
for those who were destined to declare his name in all the world, and to
communicate to mankind that knowledge of God which he had before
ordained for all nations.

<span id="iv.viii.xvi-p10"></span>8. For such the strongest conviction
of a future life was necessary, that they might be able with fearless
and unshrinking zeal to maintain the conflict with Gentile and
polytheistic error: a conflict the dangers of which they would never
have been prepared to meet, except as habituated to the contempt of
death. Accordingly, in arming his disciples against the power of this
last enemy, he delivered not his doctrines in mere verbal precepts, nor
attempted to prove the soul’s immortality, by persuasive and probable
arguments; but displayed to them in his own person a real victory over
death.

<span id="iv.viii.xvi-p11"></span>9. Such was the first and greatest
reason of our Saviour’s conflict with the power of death, whereby he
proved to his disciples the nothingness of that which is the terror of
all mankind, and afforded a visible evidence of the reality of that life
which he had promised; presenting as it were a first-fruit of our common
hope, of future life and immortality in the presence of God.

<span id="iv.viii.xvi-p12"></span>10. The second cause of his
resurrection was, that the Divine power might be manifested which dwelt
in his mortal body. Mankind had heretofore conferred Divine honors on
men who had yielded to the power of death, and had given the titles of
gods and heroes to mortals like themselves. For this reason, therefore,
the Word of God evinced his gracious character, and proved to man his
own superiority over death, recalling his mortal body to a second life,
displaying an immortal triumph over death in the eyes of all, and
teaching them to acknowledge the Author of such a victory to be the only
true God, even in death itself.

<span id="iv.viii.xvi-p13"></span>11. I may allege yet a third cause of
the Saviour’s death. He was the victim offered to the Supreme Sovereign
of the universe for the whole human race: a victim consecrated for the
need of the human race, and for the overthrow of the errors of demon
worship. For as soon as the one holy and mighty sacrifice, the sacred
body of our Saviour, had been slain for man, to be as a ransom for all
nations, heretofore involved in the guilt of impious superstition,
thenceforward the power of impure and unholy spirits was utterly
abolished, and every earth-born and delusive error was at once weakened
and destroyed.

<span id="iv.viii.xvi-p14"></span>12. Thus, then, this salutary victim
taken from among themselves, I mean the mortal body of the Word, was
offered on behalf of the common race of men. This was that sacrifice
delivered up to death, of which the sacred oracles speak: “Behold the
Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.” <span
id="fr_3571"></span>[3572](#fn_3571.md) And again, as follows: “He was led
as a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb before the shearer is dumb.”
They declare also the cause, saying: “He bears our sins, and is pained
for us: yet we accounted him to be in trouble, and in suffering, and in
affliction. But he was wounded on account of our sins, and bruised
because of our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was <span
id="page_606">p. 606</span> <span id="iv.viii.xvi-Page_606"></span>upon
him; *and* by his bruises we were healed. All we as sheep have gone
astray; every one has gone astray in this way; and the Lord gave him up
for our sins.” <span id="fr_3572"></span>[3573](#fn_3572.md)

<span id="iv.viii.xvi-p17"></span>13. Such were the causes which led to
the offering of the human body of the Word of God. But forasmuch as he
was the great high priest, consecrated to the Supreme Lord and King, and
therefore more than a victim, the Word, the Power, and the Wisdom of
God; he soon recalled his body from the grasp of death, presented it to
his Father as the first-fruit of our common salvation, and raised this
trophy, a proof at once of his victory over death and Satan, and of the
abolition of human sacrifices, for the blessing of all mankind.
