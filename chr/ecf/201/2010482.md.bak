<span id="iv.vi.ii.xxxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.xxxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXVII</span> —*Lands, Gardens,
or Houses, but not Actual Produce from them, are to be given back.*

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xxxvii-p2"></span>“<span class="c13"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.xxxvii-p2.1"></span>And</span> that there may be no
obscurity in this our ordinance, but every one may readily apprehend its
requirements, let all men hereby know that if they are now maintaining
themselves in possession of a piece of land, or a house, or garden, or
anything else which had appertained to the before-mentioned persons, it
will be good and advantageous for them to acknowledge the fact, and make
restitution with the least possible delay. On the other hand, although
it should appear that some individuals have reaped abundant profits from
this unjust possession, we do not consider that justice demands the
restitution of such profits. They must, however, declare explicitly what
amount of benefit they have thus derived, and from what sources, and
entreat our pardon for this offense; in order that their past
covetousness may in some measure be atoned for, and that the Supreme God
may accept this compensation as a token of contrition, and be pleased
graciously to pardon the sin.
