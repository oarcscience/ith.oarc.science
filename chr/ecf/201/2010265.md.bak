<span id="iii.xiii.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xiii.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIII.—</span>*The Bishops of the
Church that evinced by their Blood the Genuineness of the Religion which
they preached.*

<span id="iii.xiii.xiv-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xiii.xiv-p2.1"></span>As</span> for the rulers of the Church
that suffered martyrdom in the principal cities, the first martyr of the
kingdom of Christ whom we shall mention among the monuments of the pious
is Anthimus, <span id="fr_2553"></span>[2554](#fn_2553.md) bishop of the
city of Nicomedia, who was beheaded.

<span id="iii.xiii.xiv-p4"></span>2. Among the martyrs at Antioch was
Lucian, <span id="fr_2554"></span>[2555](#fn_2554.md) a presbyter of that
parish, whose entire life was most excellent. At Nicomedia, in the
presence of the emperor, he proclaimed the heavenly kingdom of Christ,
first in an oral defense, and afterwards by deeds as well.

<span id="iii.xiii.xiv-p6"></span>3. Of the martyrs in Phœnicia the most
distinguished were those devoted pastors of the spiritual flocks of
Christ: Tyrannion, <span id="fr_2555"></span>[2556](#fn_2555.md) bishop of
the church of Tyre; Zenobius, a presbyter of the church at Sidon; and
Silvanus, <span id="fr_2556"></span>[2557](#fn_2556.md) bishop of the
churches about Emesa.

<span id="iii.xiii.xiv-p9"></span><span id="page_334">p. 334</span>
<span id="iii.xiii.xiv-Page_334"></span>4. The last of these, with
others, was made food for wild beasts at Emesa, and was thus received
into the ranks of martyrs. The other two glorified the word of God at
Antioch through patience unto death. The bishop <span
id="fr_2557"></span>[2558](#fn_2557.md) was thrown into the depths of the
sea. But Zenobius, who was a very skillful physician, died through
severe tortures which were applied to his sides.

<span id="iii.xiii.xiv-p11"></span>5. Of the martyrs in Palestine,
Silvanus, <span id="fr_2558"></span>[2559](#fn_2558.md) bishop of the
churches about Gaza, was beheaded with thirty-nine others at the copper
mines of Phæno. <span id="fr_2559"></span>[2560](#fn_2559.md) There also
the Egyptian bishops, Peleus and Nilus, <span
id="fr_2560"></span>[2561](#fn_2560.md) with others, suffered death by
fire.

<span id="iii.xiii.xiv-p15"></span>6. Among these we must mention
Pamphilus, a presbyter, who was the great glory of the parish of
Cæsarea, and among the men of our time most admirable.

<span id="iii.xiii.xiv-p16"></span>7. The virtue of his manly deeds we
have recorded in the proper place. <span
id="fr_2561"></span>[2562](#fn_2561.md) Of those who suffered death
illustriously at Alexandria and throughout Egypt and Thebais,
Peter, <span id="fr_2562"></span>[2563](#fn_2562.md) bishop of Alexandria,
one of the most excellent teachers of the religion of Christ, should
first be mentioned; and of the presbyters with him Faustus, <span
id="fr_2563"></span>[2564](#fn_2563.md) Dius and Ammonius, perfect martyrs
of Christ; also Phileas, <span id="fr_2564"></span>[2565](#fn_2564.md)
Hesychius, <span id="fr_2565"></span>[2566](#fn_2565.md) Pachymius and
Theodorus, bishops of Egyptian churches, and besides them many other
distinguished persons who are commemorated by the parishes of their
country and region.

<span id="iii.xiii.xiv-p22"></span>It is not for us to describe the
conflicts of those who suffered for the divine religion throughout the
entire world, and to relate accurately what happened to each of them.
This would be the proper work of those who were eye-witnesses of the
events. I will describe for posterity in another work <span
id="fr_2566"></span>[2567](#fn_2566.md) those which I myself witnessed.

<span id="iii.xiii.xiv-p24"></span>8. But in the present book <span
id="fr_2567"></span>[2568](#fn_2567.md) I will add to what I have given the
revocation issued by our persecutors, and those events that occurred at
the beginning of the persecution, which will be most profitable to such
as shall read them.

<span id="iii.xiii.xiv-p27"></span>9. What words could sufficiently
describe the greatness and abundance of the prosperity of the Roman
government before the war against us, while the rulers were friendly and
peaceable toward us? Then those who were highest in the government, and
had held the position ten or twenty years, passed their time in tranquil
peace, in festivals and public games and most joyful pleasures and
cheer.

<span id="iii.xiii.xiv-p28"></span>10. While thus their authority was
growing uninterruptedly, and increasing day by day, suddenly they
changed their peaceful attitude toward us, and began an implacable war.
But the second year of this movement was not yet past, when a <span
id="page_335">p. 335</span> <span
id="iii.xiii.xiv-Page_335"></span>revolution took place in the entire
government and overturned all things.

<span id="iii.xiii.xiv-p29"></span>11. For a severe sickness came upon
the chief of those of whom we have spoken, by which his understanding
was distracted; and with him who was honored with the second rank, he
retired into private life. <span id="fr_2568"></span>[2569](#fn_2568.md)
Scarcely had he done this when the entire empire was divided; a thing
which is not recorded as having ever occurred before. <span
id="fr_2569"></span>[2570](#fn_2569.md)

<span id="iii.xiii.xiv-p32"></span>12. Not long after, the Emperor
Constantius, who through his entire life was most kindly and favorably
disposed toward his subjects, and most friendly to the Divine Word,
ended his life in the common course of nature, and left his own son,
Constantine, as emperor and Augustus in his stead. <span
id="fr_2570"></span>[2571](#fn_2570.md) He was the first that was ranked by
them among the gods, and received after death every honor which one
could pay to an emperor. <span id="fr_2571"></span>[2572](#fn_2571.md)

<span id="iii.xiii.xiv-p36"></span>13. He was the kindest and mildest of
emperors, and the only one of those of our day that passed all the time
of his government in a manner worthy of his office. Moreover, he
conducted himself toward all most favorably and beneficently. He took
not the smallest part in the war against us, but preserved the pious
that were under him unharmed and unabused. He neither threw down the
church buildings, <span id="fr_2572"></span>[2573](#fn_2572.md) nor did he
devise anything else against us. The end of his life was honorable and
thrice blessed. He alone at death left his empire happily and gloriously
to his own son as his successor,—one who was in all respects most
prudent and pious.

<span id="iii.xiii.xiv-p38"></span>14. His son Constantine entered on
the government at once, being proclaimed supreme emperor and Augustus by
the soldiers, and long before by God himself, the King of all. He showed
himself an emulator of his father’s piety toward our doctrine. Such an
one was he.

<span id="iii.xiii.xiv-p39"></span>But after this, Licinius was declared
emperor and Augustus by a common vote of the rulers. <span
id="fr_2573"></span>[2574](#fn_2573.md)

<span id="iii.xiii.xiv-p41"></span>15. These things grieved Maximinus
greatly, for until that time he had been entitled by all only Cæsar. He
therefore, being exceedingly imperious, seized the dignity for himself,
and became Augustus, being made such by himself. <span
id="fr_2574"></span>[2575](#fn_2574.md) In the mean time he whom we <span
id="page_336">p. 336</span> <span id="iii.xiii.xiv-Page_336"></span>have
mentioned as having resumed his dignity after his abdication, being
detected in conspiring against the life of Constantine, perished by a
most shameful death. <span id="fr_2575"></span>[2576](#fn_2575.md) He was
the first whose decrees and statues and public monuments were destroyed
because of his wickedness and impiety. <span
id="fr_2576"></span>[2577](#fn_2576.md)

id="iii.xiii.xiv-p6.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xiii.xiv-p7"></span> Of Tyrannion and Zenobius, we know
only what is told us here and in the next paragraph. All of the martyrs
of whom Eusebius tells us in this and the following books are
commemorated in the Martyrologies, and accounts of the passions of many
of them are given in various Acts, usually of doubtful authority. I
shall not attempt to mention such documents in my notes, nor to give
references to the Martyrologies, unless there be some special reason for
it in connection with a case of particular interest. Wherever we have
farther information in regard to any of these martyrs, in Eusebius
himself or other early Fathers, I shall endeavor to give the needed
references, passing other names by unnoticed. Tillemont (*H. E.* V.)
contains accounts of all these men, and all the necessary references to
the Martyrologies, the Bollandist Acts, etc. To his work the curious
reader is referred.

<span id="fn_2556"></span>[333:2557](2010265.htm#fr_2556.md) <span
id="iii.xiii.xiv-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xiii.xiv-p8"></span> Silvanus is mentioned again in Bk.
IX. chap. 6, and from that passage we learn that he was a very old man
at the time of his death, and that he had been bishop forty years. It
is, moreover, directly stated in that passage that Silvanus suffered
martyrdom at the same period with Peter of Alexandria, namely, in the
year 312 or thereabouts. This being the date also of Lucian’s martyrdom,
mentioned just above, we may assume it as probable that all mentioned in
this chapter suffered about the same time.

<span id="fn_2557"></span>[334:2558](2010265.htm#fr_2557.md) <span

<span id="iii.xiii.xiv-p10"></span> i.e. Tyrannion.

<span id="fn_2558"></span>[334:2559](2010265.htm#fr_2558.md) <span
id="iii.xiii.xiv-p11.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xiii.xiv-p12"></span> Silvanus, bishop of Gaza, is
mentioned also in *Mart. Pal.* chaps. 7 and 13. From the former chapter
we learn that he became a confessor at Phæno in the fifth year of the
persecution (<span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xiii.xiv-p12.1"></span>a.d.</span> 307), while still a
presbyter; from the latter, that he suffered martyrdom in the seventh
year, at the very close of the persecution in Palestine, and that he had
been eminent in his confessions from the beginning of the persecution.

<span id="fn_2559"></span>[334:2560](2010265.htm#fr_2559.md) <span
id="iii.xiii.xiv-p12.2"></span>

<span id="iii.xiii.xiv-p13"></span> Phæno was a village of Arabia
Petræa, between Petra and Zoar, and contained celebrated copper mines,
which were worked by condemned criminals.

<span id="fn_2560"></span>[334:2561](2010265.htm#fr_2560.md) <span
id="iii.xiii.xiv-p13.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xiii.xiv-p14"></span> Peleus and Nilus are mentioned in
*Mart. Pal.* chap. 13, from which passage we learn that they, like
Silvanus, died in the seventh year of the persecution. An anonymous
presbyter and a man named Patermuthius, are named there as perishing
with them in the flames.

<span id="fn_2561"></span>[334:2562](2010265.htm#fr_2561.md) <span

<span id="iii.xiii.xiv-p17"></span> On Pamphilus, see above, Bk. VII.
chap. 32, note 40. Eusebius refers here to his *Life of Pamphilus* (see
above, p. 28).

<span id="fn_2563"></span>[334:2564](2010265.htm#fr_2563.md) <span
id="iii.xiii.xiv-p18.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xiii.xiv-p19"></span> Faustus is probably to be identified
with the deacon of the same name, mentioned above in Bk. VI. chap. 40
and in Bk. VII. chap. 11. At any rate, we learn from the latter chapter
that the Faustus mentioned there lived to a great age, and died in the
persecution of Diocletian, so that nothing stands in the way of
identifying the two, though in the absence of all positive testimony,
the identification cannot be insisted upon. Of Dius and Ammonius we know
nothing.

<span id="fn_2564"></span>[334:2565](2010265.htm#fr_2564.md) <span
id="iii.xiii.xiv-p19.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xiii.xiv-p20"></span> On Phileas, see above, chap. 9, note
3.

<span id="fn_2565"></span>[334:2566](2010265.htm#fr_2565.md) <span
id="iii.xiii.xiv-p20.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xiii.xiv-p21"></span> A Latin version of an epistle
purporting to have been written by these four bishops is still extant
(see above, chap. 9, note 3). We know nothing more about the last three
named here. It has been customary to identify this Hesychius with the
reviser of the text of the LXX and the Gospels which was widely current
in Egypt in the time of Jerome, and was known as the Hesychian recension
(see Jerome, *Præf. in Paralipom., Apol. adv. Ruf.* II. 27, *Præf in
quattuor Evangelia;* and cf. *Comment. in Isaiam,* LVIII. 11). We know
little about this text; but Jerome speaks of it slightingly, as does
also the Decretal of Gelasius, VI. §15 (according to Westcott’s *Hist.
of the Canon,* 5th ed. p. 392, note 5). The identification of the two
men is quite possible, for the recension referred to belonged no doubt
to this period; but no positive arguments beyond agreement in name and
country can be urged in support of it. Fabricius proposed to identify
our Hesychius with the author of the famous Greek Lexicon, which is
still extant. But this identification is now commonly rejected; and the
author of the lexicon is regarded as a pagan, who lived in Alexandria
during the latter part of the fourth century. See Smith’s *Dict. of
Greek and Roman Biography* and Smith and Wace’s *Dict. of Christ. Biog.
s.v.*

<span id="fn_2566"></span>[334:2567](2010265.htm#fr_2566.md) <span
id="iii.xiii.xiv-p22.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xiii.xiv-p23"></span> Eusebius refers here to his *Martyrs
of Palestine.* See above, p. 29 sq.

<span id="fn_2567"></span>[334:2568](2010265.htm#fr_2567.md) <span
id="iii.xiii.xiv-p24.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xiii.xiv-p25"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xiii.xiv-p25.1"></span>κατὰ τὸν παρόντα λόγον</span>. Eusebius
seems to refer here to the eighth book of his *History;* for he uses
<span class="Greek"><span id="iii.xiii.xiv-p25.2"></span>λόγος</span>
frequently in referring to the separate books of his work, but nowhere
else, so far as I am aware, in referring to the work as a whole. This
would seem to indicate that he was thinking at this time of writing only
eight books, and of bringing his *History* to an end with the toleration
edict of Galerius, which he gives in chap. 17, below. Might it be
supposed that the present passage was written immediately after the
publication of the edict of Galerius, and before the renewal of the
persecution by Maximin? If that were so, we might assume that after the
close of that persecution, in consequence of the victory of Constantine
and Licinius, the historian felt it necessary to add yet a ninth book to
his work, not contemplated at the time he was writing his eighth; as he
seems still later, after the victory of Constantine over Licinius, to
have found it necessary to add a tenth book, in order that his work
might cover the entire period of persecution and include the final
triumph of the Church. His motive, indeed, in adding the tenth book
seems not to have been to bring the history down to the latest date
possible, for he made no additions during his later years, in spite of
the interesting and exciting events which took place after 325 <span
class="c13"><span id="iii.xiii.xiv-p25.3"></span>a.d.</span>, but to
bring it down to the final triumph of the Church over her pagan enemies.
Had there been another persecution and another toleration edict between
325 and 338, we can hardly doubt that Eusebius would have added an
account of it to his *History.* In view of these considerations, it is
possible that some time may have elapsed between the composition of the
eighth and ninth books, as well as between the composition of the ninth
and tenth.

<span id="iii.xiii.xiv-p26"></span>It must be admitted, however, that a
serious objection to this supposition lies in the fact that in chaps. 15
and 16, below, the tenth year of the persecution is spoken of, and in
the latter chapter the author is undoubtedly thinking of the Edict of
Milan, which was issued in 312, after the renewal of Maximin’s
persecution described in Book IX. I am, nevertheless, inclined to think
that Eusebius, when he wrote the present passage, was expecting to close
his work with the present book, and that the necessity for another book
made itself manifest before he finished the present one. It may be that
the words in chaps. 15 and 16 are a later insertion. I do not regard
this as probable, but knowing the changes that were made in the ninth
book in a second edition of the *History,* it must be admitted that such
changes in the eighth book are not impossible (see above, p. 30 and 45).
At the same time I prefer the former alternative, that the necessity for
another book became manifest before he finished the present one. A
slight confirmation of the theory that the ninth book was a later
addition, necessitated by the persecution of Maximin’s later years, may
be found in the appendix to the eighth book which is found in many <span
class="c13"><span id="iii.xiii.xiv-p26.1"></span>mss.</span> See below,
p. 340, note 1.

<span id="fn_2568"></span>[335:2569](2010265.htm#fr_2568.md) <span
id="iii.xiii.xiv-p29.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xiii.xiv-p30"></span> The abdication of Diocletian and
Maximian, the two Augusti, took place on May 1, 305, and therefore a
little more, not a little less, than two years after the publication of
Diocletian’s First Edict. The causes of the abdication have been given
variously by different writers, and our original authorities are
themselves in no better agreement. I do not propose to enter here into a
discussion of the subject, but am convinced that Burckhardt, Mason, and
others are correct in looking upon the abdication, not as the result of
a sudden resolve, but as a part of Diocletian’s great plan, and as such
long resolved upon and regarded as one of the fundamental requirements
of his system to be regularly observed by his successors, as well as by
himself. The abdication of Diocletian and Maximian raised the Cæsars
Constantius and Galerius to the rank of Augusti, and two new Cæsars,
Maximinus Daza in the East, and Severus in the West, were appointed to
succeed them. Diocletian himself retired to Dalmatia, his native
province, where he passed the remainder of his life in rural pursuits,
until his death in 313.

<span id="fn_2569"></span>[335:2570](2010265.htm#fr_2569.md) <span
id="iii.xiii.xiv-p30.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xiii.xiv-p31"></span> Eusebius is correct in saying that
the empire had never been divided up to this time. For it had always
been ruled as one whole, even when the imperial power was shared by two
or more princes. And even the system of Diocletian was not meant to
divide the empire into two or more independent parts. The plan was
simply to vest the supreme power in two heads, who should be given
lieutenants to assist them in the government, but who should jointly
represent the unity of the whole while severally administering their
respective territories. Imperial acts to be valid had to be joint, not
individual acts, and had to bear the name of both Augusti, while the
Cæsars were looked upon only as the lieutenants and representatives of
their respective superiors. Finally, in the last analysis, there was
theoretically but the one supreme head, the first Augustus. While
Diocletian was emperor, the theoretical unity was a practical thing. So
long as his strong hand was on the helm, Maximian, the other Augustus,
did not venture to do anything in opposition to his wishes, and thus the
great system worked smoothly. But with Diocletian’s abdication,
everything was changed. Theoretically Constantius was the first
Augustus, but Galerius, not Constantius, had had the naming of the
Cæsars; and there was no intention on Galerius’ part to acknowledge in
any way his inferiority to Constantius. In fact, being in the East,
whence the government had been carried on for twenty years, it was
natural that he should be entirely independent of Constantius, and that
thus, as Eusebius says, a genuine division of the empire, not
theoretical but practical, should be the result. The principle remained
the same; but West and East seemed now to stand, not under one great
emperor, but under two equal and independent heads.

<span id="fn_2570"></span>[335:2571](2010265.htm#fr_2570.md) <span
id="iii.xiii.xiv-p32.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xiii.xiv-p33"></span> Constantius Chlorus died at York, in
Britain, July 25, 306. According to the system of Diocletian, the Cæsar
Severus should regularly have succeeded to his place, and a new Cæsar
should have been appointed to succeed Severus. But Constantine, the
oldest son of Constantius, who was with his father at the time of his
death, was at once proclaimed his successor, and hailed as Augustus by
the army. This was by no means to Galerius’ taste, for he had far other
plans in mind; but he was not in a position to dispute Constantine’s
claims, and so made the best of the situation by recognizing Constantine
not as Augustus, but as second Cæsar, while he raised Severus to the
rank of Augustus, and made his own Cæsar Maximin first Cæsar.
Constantine was thus theoretically subject to Severus, but the
subjection was only a fiction, for he was practically independent in his
own district from that time on.

<span id="iii.xiii.xiv-p34"></span>Our sources are unanimous in giving
Constantius an amiable and pious character, unusually free from bigotry
and cruelty. Although he was obliged to show some respect to the
persecuting edicts of his superiors, Diocletian and Maximian, he seems
to have been averse to persecution, and to have gone no further than was
necessary in that direction, destroying some churches, but apparently
subjecting none of the Christians to bodily injury. We have no hint,
however, that he was a Christian, or that his generous treatment of the
Christians was the result in any way of a belief in their religion. It
was simply the result of his natural tolerance and humanity, combined,
doubtless, with a conviction that there was nothing essentially vicious
or dangerous in Christianity.

<span id="fn_2571"></span>[335:2572](2010265.htm#fr_2571.md) <span
id="iii.xiii.xiv-p34.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xiii.xiv-p35"></span> Not the first of Roman emperors to
be so honored, but the first of the four rulers who were at that time at
the head of the empire. It had been the custom from the beginning to
decree divine honors to the Roman emperors upon their decease, unless
their characters or their reigns had been such as to leave universal
hatred behind them, in which case such honors were often denied them,
and their memory publicly and officially execrated, and all their public
monuments destroyed. The ascription of such honors to Constantius,
therefore, does not in itself imply that he was superior to the other
three rulers, nor indeed superior to the emperors in general, but only
that he was not a monster, as some had been. The last emperor to receive
such divine honors was Diocletian himself, with whose death the old
pagan regime came finally to an end.

<span id="fn_2572"></span>[335:2573](2010265.htm#fr_2572.md) <span
id="iii.xiii.xiv-p36.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xiii.xiv-p37"></span> This is a mistake; for though
Constantius seems to have proceeded as mildly as possible, he did
destroy churches, as we are directly informed by Lactantius (*de Mort.
pers.* 15), and as we can learn from extant Acts and other sources (see
Mason, p. 146 sq.). Eusebius, perhaps, knew nothing about the matter,
and simply drew a conclusion from the known character of Constantius and
his general tolerance toward the Christians.

<span id="fn_2573"></span>[335:2574](2010265.htm#fr_2573.md) <span
id="iii.xiii.xiv-p39.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xiii.xiv-p40"></span> The steps which led to the
appointment of Licinius are omitted by Eusebius. Maxentius, son of the
old Augustus Maximian, spurred on by the success of Constantine’s move
in Britain, attempted to follow his example in Italy. He won the support
of a considerable portion of the army and of the Roman people, and in
October of the same year (306) was proclaimed emperor by soldiers and
people. Severus, who marched against the usurper, was defeated and
slain, and Galerius, who endeavored to revenge his fallen colleague, was
obliged to retreat without accomplishing anything. This left Italy and
Africa in the hands of an independent ruler, who was recognized by none
of the others. Toward the end of the year 307, Licinius, an old friend
and comrade-in-arms of Galerius, was appointed Augustus to succeed
Severus, whose death had occurred a number of months before, but whose
place had not yet been filled. The appointment of Licinius took place at
Carnuntum on the Danube, where Galerius, Diocletian, and Maximian met
for consultation. Inasmuch as Italy and Africa were still in the hands
of Maxentius, Licinius was given the Illyrian provinces with the rank of
second Augustus, and was thus nominally ruler of the entire West.

<span id="iii.xiii.xiv-p42"></span> Early in 308 Maximinus, the first
Cæsar, who was naturally incensed at the promotion of a new man,
Licinius, to a position above himself, was hailed as Augustus by his
troops, and at once notified Galerius of the fact. The latter could not
afford to quarrel with Maximinus, and therefore bestowed upon him the
full dignity of an Augustus, as upon Constantine also at the same time.
There were thus four independent Augusti (to say nothing of the emperor
Maxentius), and the system of Diocletian was a thing of the past.

<span id="iii.xiii.xiv-p43"></span> The reference is to the Augustus
Maximian. After his abdication he retired to Lucania, but in the
following year was induced by his son, Maxentius, to leave his
retirement, and join him in wresting Italy and Africa from Severus. It
was due in large measure to his military skill and to the prestige of
his name that Severus was vanquished and Galerius repulsed. After his
victories Maximian went to Gaul, to see Constantine and form an alliance
with him. He bestowed upon him the title of Augustus and the hand of his
daughter Fausta, and endeavored to induce him to join him in a campaign
against Galerius. This, however, Constantine refused to do; and Maximian
finally returned to Rome, where he found his son Maxentius entrenched in
the affections of the soldiers and the people, and bent upon ruling for
himself. After a bitter quarrel with him, in which he attempted, but
failed, to wrest the purple from him, he left the city, attended the
congress of Carnuntum, and acquiesced in the appointment of Licinius as
second Augustus, which of course involved the formal renunciation of his
own claims and those of his son. He then betook himself again to
Constantine, but during the latter’s temporary absence treacherously had
himself proclaimed Augustus by some of the troops. He was, however,
easily overpowered by Constantine, but was forgiven and granted his
liberty again. About two years later, unable to resist the desire to
reign, he made an attempt upon Constantine’s life with the hope of once
more securing the power for himself, but was detected and allowed to
choose the manner of his own death, and in February, 310, strangled
himself. The general facts just stated are well made out, but there is
some uncertainty as to the exact order of events, in regard to which our
sources are at variance. Compare especially the works of Hunziker,
Burckhardt, and Mason, and the respective articles in Smith’s *Dict. of
Greek and Roman Biog.*

<span id="iii.xiii.xiv-p44"></span>Eusebius’ memory plays him false in
this passage; for he has not mentioned, as he states, Maximian’s
resumption of the imperial dignity after his abdication. A few important
<span class="c13"><span id="iii.xiii.xiv-p44.1"></span>mss.</span>,
followed by Heinichen, omit the entire clause, “whom we have mentioned
as having resumed his dignity after his abdication.” But the words are
found in the majority of the <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xiii.xiv-p44.2"></span>mss.</span> and in Rufinus, and are
accepted by all the other editors. There can, in fact, be no doubt that
Eusebius wrote the words, and that the omission of them in some codices
is due to the fact that some scribe or scribes perceived his slip, and
consequently omitted the clause.

<span id="fn_2576"></span>[336:2577](2010265.htm#fr_2576.md) <span
id="iii.xiii.xiv-p44.3"></span>

<span id="iii.xiii.xiv-p45"></span> Valesius understands by this (as in
§12, above), the first of the four emperors. But we find in Lactantius
(*ibid.* chap. 42) the distinct statement that Diocletian (whose statues
were thrown down in Rome with those of Maximian, to which they were
joined, Janus-fashion) was the first emperor that had ever suffered such
an indignity, and there is no hint in the text that Eusebius means any
less than that in making his statement, though we know that it is
incorrect.
