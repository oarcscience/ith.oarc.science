<span id="iv.vii.v-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vii.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V</span>.—*That Christ, the Son of
God, created All Things, and has appointed to Every Thing the Term of
its Existence.*

<span id="iv.vii.v-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vii.v-p2.1"></span>But</span> why do I defile my tongue with
unhallowed words, when my object is to sound the praises of the true
God? Rather let me cleanse myself, as it were, from this bitter draught
by the pure stream which flows from the everlasting fountain of the
virtue <span id="fr_3384"></span>[3385](#fn_3384) of that God who is the
object of my praise. Be it my special province to glorify Christ, as
well by the actions of my life, as by that thanksgiving which is due to
him for the manifold and signal blessings which he has bestowed. I
affirm, therefore, that he <span id="fr_3385"></span>[3386](#fn_3385)
has laid the foundations of this universe; and conceived the race of
men, ordaining these things by his word. And immediately he transferred
our newly created parents (ignorant at first, according to his will, of
good and evil) to a happy region, abounding in flowers and fruits of
every kind. <span id="fr_3386"></span>[3387](#fn_3386) At length,
however, he appointed them a seat on earth befitting creatures endued
with reason; and then unfolded to their faculties, as intelligent
beings, the knowledge of good and evil. Then, too, he bade the race
increase; and each healthy region of the world, as far as the bounds of
the circumambient ocean, became the dwelling-place of men; while with
this increase of numbers the invention of the useful arts went hand in
<span id="page_564">p. 564</span> <span
id="iv.vii.v-Page_564"></span>hand. Meantime the various species of
inferior <span id="fr_3387"></span>[3388](#fn_3387) animals increased in
due proportion, each kind discovering some characteristic quality, the
special gift of nature: the tame distinguished by gentleness and
obedience to man; the wild by strength and swiftness, and an instinctive
foresight which warned them to escape from peril. The gentler animals he
placed entirely beneath man’s protecting care, but entailed on him the
necessity of strife with those of fiercer nature. He next created the
feathered race, manifold in number, diverse in character and habits;
brilliant with every variety of color, and endued with native powers of
melody. Finally, having arranged with wise discrimination whatever else
the compass of this world contains, and having assigned to every
creature the stated term of its existence, he thus completed the
beautiful order of the perfect whole.

<span id="iv.vii.v-p5"></span> \[Constantine seems to have supposed the
Paradise of our first parents to be somewhere apart from this earth. In
this fanciful idea, which is obviously indefensible from Scripture he is
countenanced by the opinions of Tertullian, Tatian, Clement of
Alexandria, Origen, Valentinian, and Jerome, some of whom placed it in
or above the third heaven, others in the fourth, others again in a world
superior to the present, &c. See the note of Valesius, who quotes from
some of these Fathers. In reference to what follows, we may ask, Was
Constantine acquainted with, or does he avoid noticing, the
circumstances of the fall?—*Bag.*\] *Ans.* Constantine like many another
to our own day seems to regard the “fall” as a fall upwards—that
complacent optimism which ignores Scripture and Schopenhauer alike.
