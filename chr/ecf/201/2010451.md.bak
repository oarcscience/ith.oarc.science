the Cities subject to Licinius, as of Constantine’s Troops passing
through them.*

<span id="iv.vi.ii.vi-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.vi-p2.1"></span>While</span> these things were taking place
a supernatural appearance is said to have been observed in the cities
subject to the tyrant’s rule. Different detachments of Constantine’s
army seemed to present themselves to the view, marching at noonday
through these cities, as though they had obtained the victory. In
reality, not a single soldier was anywhere present at the time, and yet
this appearance was seen through the agency of a divine and superior
power, and foreshadowed what was shortly coming to pass. For as soon as
the armies were ready to engage, he who had broken through the ties of
friendly alliance <span id="fr_3166"></span>[3167](#fn_3166.md) was the
first to commence the battle; on which Constantine, calling on the name
of “God the Supreme Saviour,” and giving this as the watchword to his
soldiers, overcame him in this first conflict: and not long after in a
second battle he gained a still more important and decisive victory, the
salutary trophy preceding the ranks of his army.
