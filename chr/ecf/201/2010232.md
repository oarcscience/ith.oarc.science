flourished at that Time.*

<span id="iii.xii.xv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xii.xv-p2.1"></span>At</span> that time Xystus <span
id="fr_2276"></span>[2277](#fn_2276) was still presiding over the church
of Rome, and Demetrianus, <span id="fr_2277"></span>[2278](#fn_2277)
successor of Fabius, <span id="fr_2278"></span>[2279](#fn_2278) over the
church of Antioch, and Firmilianus <span
id="fr_2279"></span>[2280](#fn_2279) over that of Cæsarea in Cappadocia;
and besides these, Gregory <span id="fr_2280"></span>[2281](#fn_2280)
and his brother Athenodorus, <span id="fr_2281"></span>[2282](#fn_2281)
friends of Origen, were presiding over the churches in Pontus; and
Theoctistus <span id="fr_2282"></span>[2283](#fn_2282) of Cæsarea in
Palestine having died, Domnus <span id="fr_2283"></span>[2284](#fn_2283)
received the episcopate there. He held it but a short time, and
Theotecnus, <span id="fr_2284"></span>[2285](#fn_2284) our contemporary,
succeeded him. He also was a member of Origen’s school. But in
Jerusalem, after the death of Mazabanes, <span
id="fr_2285"></span>[2286](#fn_2285) Hymenæus, <span
id="fr_2286"></span>[2287](#fn_2286) who has been celebrated among us
for a great many years, succeeded to his seat.

id="iii.xii.xv-p9.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.xv-p10"></span> Of the life and character of Domnus we
know nothing. So far as I am aware he is mentioned only here. His dates
are uncertain, but his predecessor, Theoctistus, was still bishop in the
time of Stephen of Rome (254–257; see above, Bk. VI. chap. 19, note 27),
while he himself became bishop before the death of Xystus of Rome, as we
may gather from this chapter, i.e. before August, 258 (see chap. 5, note
5), so that between these dates his accession must be placed. Eusebius’
words in this passage will hardly admit an episcopate of more than one
or two years; possibly he was bishop but a few months.

<span id="fn_2284"></span>[303:2285](2010232.htm#fr_2284) <span
id="iii.xii.xv-p10.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.xv-p11"></span> The dates of Theotecnus are likewise
uncertain. Eusebius in Bk. VII. chap. 32, says that he was acquainted
with Pamphilus during the episcopate of Agapius (the successor of
Theotecnus), implying that he first made his acquaintance then. It is
therefore likely that Agapius became bishop some years before the
persecution of Diocletian, for otherwise we hardly allow enough time for
the acquaintance of Pamphilus and Eusebius who did so much work
together, and apparently were friends for so long a time. Pamphilus
himself suffered martyrdom in 309 <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xii.xv-p11.1"></span>a.d.</span> Theotecnus was quite a
prominent man and was present at the two Antiochian synods mentioned in
chaps. 27 and 30, which were convened to consider the heresy of Paul of
Samosata.

<span id="iii.xii.xv-p12"></span> On Mazabanes, see Bk. VI. chap. 39,
note 5.

<span id="fn_2286"></span>[303:2287](2010232.htm#fr_2286) <span
id="iii.xii.xv-p12.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.xv-p13"></span> According to the *Chron.* of Eusebius,
Hymenæus was bishop of Jerusalem from 265–298. It is expressly stated in
the *Chron.* that the dates of the earlier Jerusalem bishops are not
known (see Bk. V. chap. 12, note 1); but with the dates of the bishops
of the latter part of the third century Eusebius can hardly have been
unacquainted, and that Hymenæus was bishop at any rate as early as 265
is proved by chaps. 27 and 30 (see the note on Mazabanes referred to
just above). The dates given in the *Chron.* may therefore be accepted
as at least approximately correct.
