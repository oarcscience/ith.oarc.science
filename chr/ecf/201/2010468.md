<span id="iv.vi.ii.xxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIII</span>.—*That he declared
God to be the Author of his Prosperity: and concerning his Rescripts.*

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xxiii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.xxiii-p2.1"></span>And</span> now that, through the
powerful aid of God his Saviour, all nations owned their subjection to
the emperor’s authority, he openly proclaimed to all the name of Him to
whose bounty he owed all his blessings, and declared that He, and not
himself, was the author of his past victories. This declaration, written
both in the Latin and Greek languages, he caused to be transmitted
through every province of the empire. Now the excellence of his style of
expression <span id="fr_3179"></span>[3180](#fn_3179.md) may be known from
a perusal of his letters themselves which were two in number; one
addressed to the churches of God; the other to the heathen population in
the several cities of the empire. The latter of these I think it well to
insert here as connected with my present subject, in order on the one
hand that a copy of this document may be recorded as matter of history,
and thus preserved to posterity, and on the other that it may serve to
confirm the truth of my present narrative. It is taken from an authentic
copy of the imperial statute in my own possession and the signature in
the emperor’s own handwriting attaches as it were the impress of truth
to the statement I have made.
