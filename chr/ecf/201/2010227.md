<span id="iii.xii.x-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xii.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter IX.—</span>*The Ungodly Baptism of
the Heretics.*

<span id="iii.xii.x-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xii.x-p2.1"></span>His</span> fifth epistle <span
id="fr_2201"></span>[2202](#fn_2201.md) was written to Xystus, <span
id="fr_2202"></span>[2203](#fn_2202.md) bishop of Rome. In this, after
saying much against the heretics, he relates a certain occurrence of his
time as follows: “For truly, brother, I am in need of counsel, and I ask
thy judgment concerning a certain matter which has come to me, fearing
that I may be in error.

<span id="iii.xii.x-p5"></span>2. For one of the brethren that assemble,
who has long been considered a believer, and who, before my ordination,
and I think before the appointment of the blessed Heraclas, <span
id="fr_2203"></span>[2204](#fn_2203.md) was a member of the congregation,
was present with those who were recently baptized. And when he heard the
questions and answers, <span id="fr_2204"></span>[2205](#fn_2204.md) he
came to me weeping, and bewailing himself; and falling at my feet he
acknowledged and protested that the baptism with which he had been
baptized among the heretics was not of this character, nor in any
respect like this, because it was full of impiety and blasphemy. <span
id="fr_2205"></span>[2206](#fn_2205.md)

<span id="iii.xii.x-p9"></span>3. And he said that his soul was now
pierced with sorrow, and that he had not confidence to lift his eyes to
God, because he had set out from those impious words and deeds. And on
this account he besought that he might receive this most perfect
purification, and reception and grace.

<span id="iii.xii.x-p10"></span>4. But I did not dare to do this; and
said that his long communion was sufficient for this. For I should not
dare to renew from the beginning one who had heard the giving of thanks
and joined in repeating the Amen; who had stood by the table and had
stretched forth his hands to receive the blessed food; and who had
received it, and partaken for a long while of the body and blood of our
Lord Jesus Christ. But I exhorted him to be of good courage, and to
approach the partaking of the saints with firm faith and good hope.

<span id="iii.xii.x-p11"></span>5. But he does not cease lamenting, and
he shudders to approach the table, and scarcely, though entreated, does
he dare to be present at the prayers.” <span
id="fr_2206"></span>[2207](#fn_2206.md)

<span id="iii.xii.x-p13"></span><span id="page_298">p. 298</span> <span
id="iii.xii.x-Page_298"></span>6. Besides these there is also extant
another epistle of the same man on baptism, addressed by him and his
parish to Xystus and the church at Rome. In this he considers the
question then agitated with extended argument. And there is extant yet
another after these, addressed to Dionysius of Rome, <span
id="fr_2207"></span>[2208](#fn_2207.md) concerning Lucian. <span
id="fr_2208"></span>[2209](#fn_2208.md) So much with reference to these.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_2201"></span>[297:2202](2010227.htm#fr_2201.md) <span
id="iii.xii.x-p2.2"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.x-p3"></span> i.e. his fifth epistle on the subject of
baptism (see above, chap. 5, note 6). The sixth, likewise addressed to
Xystus, is mentioned below in §6.

<span id="fn_2202"></span>[297:2203](2010227.htm#fr_2202.md) <span
id="iii.xii.x-p3.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.x-p4"></span> On Xystus II. of Rome, see chap 5, note
5.

<span id="fn_2203"></span>[297:2204](2010227.htm#fr_2203.md) <span
id="iii.xii.x-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.x-p6"></span> On Heraclas, see above Bk. VI. chap. 3,
note 2.

<span id="fn_2204"></span>[297:2205](2010227.htm#fr_2204.md) <span
id="iii.xii.x-p6.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.x-p7"></span> See the previous chapter, note 3.

<span id="fn_2205"></span>[297:2206](2010227.htm#fr_2205.md) <span
id="iii.xii.x-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.x-p8"></span> The reference here, of course, is not to
the Novatians, because this old man, who had been a regular attendant
upon the orthodox Church since the time of Heraclas, if not before, had
been baptized by the heretics long before Novatian arose. The epistle
seems to contain no reference to Novatian; at least, the fragment which
we have is dealing with an entirely different subject.

<span id="fn_2206"></span>[297:2207](2010227.htm#fr_2206.md) <span
id="iii.xii.x-p11.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.x-p12"></span> Dittrich finds in this epistle an
evidence that Dionysius was not fully convinced of the advisability of
re-baptizing converts from heretical bodies, that he wavered in fact
between the Eastern and the Roman practices, but I am unable to see that
the epistle implies anything of the kind. It is not that he doubts the
necessity of re-baptism in ordinary cases,—he is not discussing that
subject at all,—the question is, does long communion itself take the
place of baptism; does not a man, unwittingly baptized, gain through
such communion the grace from the Spirit which is ordinarily conveyed in
baptism, and might not the rite of baptism at so late a date be an
insult to the Spirit, who might have been working through the sacrament
of the eucharist during all these years? It is this question which
Dionysius desires to have Xystus assist him in answering—a question
which has nothing to do, in Dionysius’ mind, with the validity or
non-validity of heretical baptism, for it will be noticed that he does
not base his refusal to baptize the man upon the fact that he has
already been baptized, partially, or imperfectly, or in any other way,
but solely upon the fact that he has for so long been partaking of the
eucharist.

<span id="fn_2207"></span>[298:2208](2010227.htm#fr_2207.md) <span
id="iii.xii.x-p13.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.x-p14"></span> On Dionysius of Rome, see chap. 27,
note 2.

<span id="fn_2208"></span>[298:2209](2010227.htm#fr_2208.md) <span
id="iii.xii.x-p14.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.x-p15"></span> So many Lucians of this time are known
to us that we cannot speak with certainty as to the identity of the one
referred to here. But it may perhaps be suggested that the well-known
Carthaginian Confessor is meant, who caused Cyprian so much trouble by
granting letters of pardon indiscriminately to the lapsed, in defiance
of regular custom and of Cyprian’s authority (see *Cypriani Ep.* 16, 17,
20, 21, 22; *al.* 23, 26, 21, 22, 27). If this be the Lucian referred
to, the epistle must have discussed the *lapsi,* and the conditions upon
which they were to be received again into the Church. That the epistle
did not, like the one mentioned just before, have to do with the subject
of baptism, seems clear from the fact that it is not numbered among the
epistles on that subject, as six others are.
