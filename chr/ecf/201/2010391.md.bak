<span id="iv.vi.i.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI</span>.—*That he was the Servant
of God, and the Conqueror of Nations.*

<span id="iv.vi.i.vi-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.vi-p2.1"></span>Thus</span>, like a faithful and good
servant, did he act and testify, openly declaring and confessing himself
the obedient minister of the supreme King. And God forthwith rewarded
him, by making him ruler and sovereign, and victorious to such a degree
that he alone of all rulers pursued a continual course of conquest,
unsubdued and invincible, and through his trophies a greater ruler than
tradition records ever to have been before. So dear was he to God, and
so blessed; so pious and so fortunate in all that he undertook, that
with the greatest facility he obtained the authority over more nations
than any who had preceded him, <span
id="fr_3063"></span>[3064](#fn_3063.md) and yet retained his power,
undisturbed, to the very close of his life.
