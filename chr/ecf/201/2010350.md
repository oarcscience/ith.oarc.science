<span id="iv.iii.i.ix-p1"></span> §9. *Last Years.*

<span id="iv.iii.i.ix-p2"></span>Later in this year, Constantine is
known to have been at Jerusalem, where he dedicated a church (*V. C.* 4.
40; Chron. Pasch., but wrong year). It was also the year of the Synods
of Tyre (Athanas. *c. Ar.* 1. p. 788; *V. C.* 4. 41; Theod. 1. 28). The
same year, or early in the following one, Eusebius pronounced his
tricennial oration (see *Special Prolegomena*). In 337 the Great Emperor
died at Ancyrona, near Nicomedia, just as he was preparing for an
expedition against the Persians, and was buried in the Church of the
Apostles, at Constantinople (cf. notes on Eusebius’ Life of
Constantine). <span id="fr_3038"></span>[3039](#fn_3038.md)

<span id="iv.iii.i.ix-p3"></span> The events and dates of these later
periods have to do mainly with theological matters,—the “religious”
activity of Constantine, to which Eusebius devotes his attention so
fully,—and are treated in the *V. C.*
