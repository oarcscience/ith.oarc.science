Bishop of Alexandria.*

<span id="iii.xi.xxvi-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xi.xxvi-p2.1"></span>It</span> was in the tenth year of the
above-mentioned reign that Origen removed from Alexandria to
Cæsarea, <span id="fr_1995"></span>[1996](#fn_1995) leaving the charge
of the catechetical school in that city to Heraclas. Not long afterward
Demetrius, bishop of the church of Alexandria, died, having held the
office for forty-three full years, <span
id="fr_1996"></span>[1997](#fn_1996) and Heraclas succeeded him. At this
time Firmilianus, <span id="fr_1997"></span>[1998](#fn_1997) bishop of
Cæsarea in Cappadocia, was conspicuous.

<span id="iii.xi.xxvi-p5"></span> Firmilian, bishop of Cæsarea, the
capital of Cappadocia (to be distinguished from Cæsarea in Palestine),
was one of the most famous prelates of his day in the Eastern Church. He
was a friend of Origen, as we learn from the next chapter, and took part
in a council called on account of the schism of Novatian (see chap. 46),
and also in councils called to consider the case of Paul of Samosata
(see Bk. VII. chaps. 28 and 30). He was one of the bishops whom Stephen
excommunicated because they rebaptized heretics (see Bk. VII. chap. 2,
note 3, and chap. 5, note 4), and he wrote an epistle upon this subject
to Cyprian, which is extant in a Latin translation made by Cyprian
himself (*Ep.* 74, *al.* 75, in the collection of Cyprian’s epistles.
See *Dict. of Christ. Biog.* I. 751, note). Basil (*de Spiritu Sancto,*
29) refers to works (<span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xi.xxvi-p5.1"></span>λόγοι</span>) left by Firmilian, but none
of them are extant except the single epistle mentioned, nor do we hear
from any other source that he was a writer. Jerome does not mention him
in his *De vir. ill.* The exact date of his accession is unknown to us,
as it very likely was to Eusebius also. He was a bishop already in the
tenth year of Alexander (231 <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xi.xxvi-p5.2"></span>a.d.</span>), or very soon afterward, and
from Bk. VII. chap. 30, we learn that he died at Tarsus on his way to
Antioch to attend a council which had been summoned to deal with Paul of
Samosata. This synod was held about 265 <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xi.xxvi-p5.3"></span>a.d.</span> (not in 272 as is commonly
supposed; see Bk. VII. chap. 29, note 1), and it is at this time,
therefore, that we must put the death of Firmilian; so that he was
bishop of Cæsarea at least some thirty-four years.
