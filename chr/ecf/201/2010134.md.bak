id="iii.ix.xxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXV.—</span>*Philip and Modestus.*

<span id="iii.ix.xxv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.ix.xxv-p2.1"></span>Philip</span> who, as we learn from the
words of Dionysius, <span id="fr_1271"></span>[1272](#fn_1271.md) was
bishop of the parish of Gortyna, likewise wrote a most elaborate work
against Marcion, <span id="fr_1272"></span>[1273](#fn_1272.md) as did also
Irenæus <span id="fr_1273"></span>[1274](#fn_1273.md) and Modestus. <span
id="fr_1274"></span>[1275](#fn_1274.md) The last named has exposed the
error of the man more clearly than the rest to the view of all. There
are a number of others also whose works are still presented by a great
many of the brethren.

<span id="iii.ix.xxv-p4"></span> Philip’s work against Marcion which
Eusebius mentions here is no longer extant, and, so far as the writer
knows, is mentioned by no other Father except Jerome (*de vir. ill.*
30), who tells us only what Eusebius records here, using, however, the
adjective *præclarum* for Eusebius’ <span class="Greek"><span

<span id="iii.ix.xxv-p5"></span> On Irenæus, see above, chap. 21, note
9.

<span id="iii.ix.xxv-p6"></span> Modestus, also, is a writer known to us
only from Eusebius (here, and in chap. 21) and from Jerome (*de vir.
ill.* 32). According to the latter, the work against Marcion was still
extant in his day, but he gives us no description of it. He adds,
however, that a number of spurious works ascribed to Modestus were in
circulation at that time (*Feruntur sub nomine ejus et alia syntagmata,
sed ab eruditis quasi* <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.ix.xxv-p6.1"></span>ψευδόγραφα</span> *repudiantur*). Neither
these nor the genuine works are now extant, so far as we know.
