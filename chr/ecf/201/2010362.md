<span id="iv.iii.iii.ii-p1"></span> §2. *Oratorical Writings.*

<span id="iv.iii.iii.ii-p2"></span>According to Eusebius (*V. C.* 4. 29;
cf. 4. 55) these were very numerous, and it may well be believed. He
seems to have done much of everything he undertook at all—fighting, or
learning, or building temples, or making laws, he was nothing if not
incessant. He had a habit of inflicting his orations on his court, and
undoubtedly had plenty of enthusiastic hearers, as any emperor would,
and as Eusebius says he did. They seem to have been generally
philosophical with as much religion as possible worked in (*V. C.* 4.
9). Not many are extant, but we have some account of the few following:

<span id="iv.iii.iii.ii-p3"></span>1. *Oration to the saints (Oratio ad
sanctum cœtum,* S. C.). For this see the following translation and
Special Prolegomena.

<span id="iv.iii.iii.ii-p4"></span>2. *Address to the Council of Nicæa
in praise of peace (Ad Syn. Nic.),* in Euseb. *V. C.* 3. 12. Address of
welcome. He rejoices in the assembly, and exhorts them to be united,
that they may thereby please God and do a favor to their emperor.

<span id="iv.iii.iii.ii-p5"></span>3. *Oration to the Council of Nicæa,
in Gelasius, Hist. Coun. Nic.* 1. 7. Begins with rhetorical comparison
of the Church to a temple, and ends with injunctions to observe peace
and to search the Scriptures as the authority in all points of doctrine.
Appears dubiously authentic.

<span id="iv.iii.iii.ii-p6"></span>4. *Address to the bishops on their
departure from Nicæa.* Abstract in Euseb. *V. C.* 32. 1. Exhorts them to
keep peace, cautions against jealousy, &c.

<span id="iv.iii.iii.ii-p7"></span>5. *Funeral oration.* A description
in Euseb. *V. C.* 4. 55. Dwells on the immortality of the soul, the
blessings laid up for those who love God, and the ruin of the ungodly.

<span id="iv.iii.iii.ii-p8"></span>His method of composition is spoken
of by Eusebius (*V. C.* 4. 29), and his manner of delivery may be
gathered from Eusebius’ description of his speech at the opening of the
Council of Nicæa (*V. C.* 3. 11). For the style of his oratorical
discourses, compare remarks on the Oration to the Saints in the Special
Prolegomena.
