Clement.*

<span id="iii.viii.xvi-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.viii.xvi-p2.1"></span>There</span> is extant an epistle of this
Clement <span id="fr_705"></span>[706](#fn_705) which is acknowledged to
be genuine and is of considerable length and of remarkable merit. <span
id="fr_706"></span>[707](#fn_706) He wrote it in the name of the church
of Rome to the church of Corinth, when a sedition had arisen in the
latter church. <span id="fr_707"></span>[708](#fn_707) We know that this
epistle also has been publicly used in a great many churches both in
former times and in our own. <span id="fr_708"></span>[709](#fn_708) And
of the fact that a sedition did take place in the church of Corinth at
the time referred to Hegesippus is a trustworthy witness. <span

<span id="iii.viii.xvi-p3"></span> This epistle of Clement, which is
still extant in two Greek <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.viii.xvi-p3.1"></span>mss.</span>, and in a Syriac version,
consists of fifty-nine chapters, and is found in all editions of the
Apostolic Fathers. It purports to have been written from the church at
Rome to the church at Corinth, but bears the name of no author.
Unanimous tradition, however (beginning with Dionysius of Corinth, in
Eusebius, IV. 23), ascribes it to Clement, Bishop of Rome, and scholars,
with hardly an exception, accept it as his work. It was, in all
probability, written immediately after the persecution of Domitian, in
the last years of the first century, and is one of the earliest, perhaps
the very earliest, post-biblical works which we have. It was held in
very high repute in the early Church, and in the Alexandrian Codex it
stands among the canonical books as a part of the New Testament (though
this is exceptional; cf. chap. 3, above, and chap. 25, below, in both of
which this epistle is omitted, though Eusebius is giving lists of New
Testament books, both accepted and disputed). We have had the epistle
complete only since 1875, when Bryennios discovered a <span
class="c13"><span id="iii.viii.xvi-p3.2"></span>ms.</span> containing it
and other valuable works. Previously a part of the epistle had been
wanting. In consequence the older editions have been superseded by the
more recent. See appendix to Lightfoot’s edition (1877), which gives the
recovered portions of the text; so, also, the later editions of Gebhardt
and Harnack’s, and of Hilgenfeld’s Apostolic Fathers. The epistle is
translated in the *Ante-Nicene Fathers,* I. p. 5–21.

<span id="iii.viii.xvi-p5"></span> See the epistle itself, especially
chaps. 1 and 3. It was these seditions in the church at Corinth which
occasioned the epistle.

<span id="iii.viii.xvi-p6"></span> Compare the words of Dionysius of
Corinth, in Bk. IV. chap. 23. Though the epistle was held in high
esteem, it was not looked upon as a part of the New Testament canon.

<span id="fn_709"></span>[147:710](2010085.htm#fr_709) <span
id="iii.viii.xvi-p6.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.xvi-p7"></span> Hegesippus’ testimony upon this point
is no longer extant.
