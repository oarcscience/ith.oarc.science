<span id="iii.xii.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xii.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter V.—</span>*The Peace following the
Persecution.*

<span id="iii.xii.vi-p2"></span>1. “<span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xii.vi-p2.1"></span>But</span> know now, my brethren, that all
the churches throughout the East and beyond, which formerly were
divided, have become united. And all the bishops everywhere are of one
mind, and rejoice greatly in the peace which has come beyond
expectation. Thus Demetrianus in Antioch, <span
id="fr_2173"></span>[2174](#fn_2173.md) Theoctistus in Cæsarea, Mazabanes
in Ælia, Marinus in Tyre (Alexander having fallen asleep), <span
id="fr_2174"></span>[2175](#fn_2174.md) Heliodorus in Laodicea (Thelymidres
being dead), Helenus in Tarsus, and all the churches of Cilicia,
Firmilianus, and all Cappadocia. I have named only the more illustrious
bishops, that I may not make my epistle too long and my words too
burdensome.

<span id="iii.xii.vi-p5"></span>2. And all Syria, and Arabia to which
you send help when needed, <span id="fr_2175"></span>[2176](#fn_2175.md)
and whither you have just written, <span
id="fr_2176"></span>[2177](#fn_2176.md) Mesopotamia, Pontus, Bithynia, and
in short all everywhere are rejoicing and glorifying God for the
unanimity and brotherly love.” Thus far Dionysius.

<span id="iii.xii.vi-p8"></span>3. But Stephen, having filled his office
two years, was succeeded by Xystus. <span
id="fr_2177"></span>[2178](#fn_2177.md) Diony<span id="page_295">p.
295</span> <span id="iii.xii.vi-Page_295"></span>sius wrote him a second
epistle on baptism, <span id="fr_2178"></span>[2179](#fn_2178.md) in which
he shows him at the same time the opinion and judgment of Stephen and
the other bishops, and speaks in this manner of Stephen:

<span id="iii.xii.vi-p11"></span>4. “He therefore had written previously
concerning Helenus and Firmilianus, and all those in Cilicia and
Cappadocia and Galatia and the neighboring nations, saying that he would
not commune with them for this same cause; namely, that they re-baptized
heretics. But consider the importance of the matter.

<span id="iii.xii.vi-p12"></span>5. For truly in the largest synods of
the bishops, as I learn, decrees have been passed on this subject, that
those coming over from heresies should be instructed, and then should be
washed <span id="fr_2179"></span>[2180](#fn_2179.md) and cleansed from the
filth of the old and impure leaven. And I wrote entreating him
concerning all these things.” Further on he says:

<span id="iii.xii.vi-p14"></span>6. “I wrote also, at first in few
words, recently in many, to our beloved fellow-presbyters,
Dionysius <span id="fr_2180"></span>[2181](#fn_2180.md) and Philemon, <span
id="fr_2181"></span>[2182](#fn_2181.md) who formerly had held the same
opinion as Stephen, and had written to me on the same matters.” So much
in regard to the above-mentioned controversy.

Helenus, see Bk. VI. chap. 46. On Theoctistus, see *ibid.* chap. 19,

<span id="iii.xii.vi-p4"></span> This clause (<span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xii.vi-p4.1"></span>κοιμηθέντος ᾽Αλεξ€νδρου</span>) is placed by
Rufinus, followed by Stroth, Zimmermann, Valesius (in his notes), Closs,
and Crusè, immediately after the words “Mazabanes in Ælia.” But all the
<span class="c13"><span id="iii.xii.vi-p4.2"></span>mss.</span> followed
by all the other editors give the clause in the position which it
occupies above in my translation. It is natural, of course, to think of
the famous Alexander of Jerusalem as referred to here (Bk. VI. chap. 8,
note 6), but it is difficult to see how, if he were referred to, the
words could stand in the position which they occupy in the text. It is
not impossible, however, to assume simple carelessness on Dionysius’
part to explain the peculiar order, and thus hold that Alexander of
Jerusalem is here referred to. Nor is it, on the other hand, impossible
(though certainly difficult) to suppose that Dionysius is referring to a
bishop of Tyre named Alexander, whom we hear of from no other source.

<span id="fn_2175"></span>[294:2176](2010223.htm#fr_2175.md) <span
id="iii.xii.vi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.vi-p6"></span> The church of Rome had been from an
early date very liberal in assisting the needy in every quarter. See the
epistle of Dionysius of Corinth to Soter, bishop of Rome, quoted above
in Bk. IV. chap. 23.

<span id="fn_2176"></span>[294:2177](2010223.htm#fr_2176.md) <span
id="iii.xii.vi-p6.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.vi-p7"></span> Dionysius speaks just below (§6) of
epistles or an epistle of Stephen upon the subject of baptism, in which
he had announced that he would no longer commune with the Oriental
bishops, who held to the custom of baptizing heretics. And it is this
epistle which must have stirred up the rage of Firmilian, which shows
itself in his epistle to Cyprian, already mentioned. The epistle of
Stephen referred to here, however, cannot be identical with that one, or
Dionysius would not speak of it in such a pleasant tone. It very likely
had something to do with the heresy of Novatian, of which Dionysius is
writing. It is no longer extant, and we know only what Dionysius tells
us about it in this passage.

<span id="fn_2177"></span>[294:2178](2010223.htm#fr_2177.md) <span
id="iii.xii.vi-p8.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.vi-p9"></span> Known as Sixtus II. in the list of
Roman bishops. On Sixtus I. see above, Bk. IV. chap. 4, note 3. That
Xystus (or Sixtus) was martyred under Valerian we are told not only by
the Liberian catalogue, but also by Cyprian, in an epistle written
shortly before his own death, in 258 (No. 81, *al.* 80), in which he
gives a detailed account of it. There is no reason to doubt the date
given by the Liberian catalogue (Aug. 6, 258); for the epistle of
Cyprian shows that it must have taken place just about that time,
Valerian having sent a very severe rescript to the Senate in the summer
of 258. This fixed point for the martyrdom of Xystus enables us to
rectify all the dates of the bishops of this period (cf. Lipsius,
*l.c.*). As to the duration of his episcopate, the ancient authorities
differ greatly. The Liberian catalogue assigns to it two years eleven
months and six days, but this is impossible, as can be gathered from
Cyprian’s epistle. Lipsius retains the months and days (twelve or six
days), rejecting the two years as an interpolation, and thus putting his
accession on Aug. 24 (or 31), 257. According to Eusebius, chap. 27, and
the Armenian *Chron.,* he held office eleven years, which is quite
impossible, and which, as Lipsius remarks, is due to the eleven months
which stood in the original source from which the notice was taken, and
which appears in the Liberian catalogue. Jerome’s version of the
*Chron.* ascribes eight years to his episcopate, but this, too, is quite
impossible, and the date given for his accession (the first year of
Valerian) is inconsistent with the notice which he gives in regard to
Stephen. Xystus upheld the Roman practice of accepting heretics and
schismatics without re-baptism, but he seems to have adopted a more
conciliatory tone toward those who held the opposite view than his
predecessor Stephen had done (cf. Pontius’ *Vita Cypriani,* chap. 14).

<span id="fn_2178"></span>[295:2179](2010223.htm#fr_2178.md) <span
id="iii.xii.vi-p9.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.vi-p10"></span> The first of Dionysius’ epistles on
baptism was written to Stephen of Rome, as we learn from chap. 2, above.
Four others are mentioned by Eusebius, addressed respectively to
Philemon, a Roman presbyter (chap. 7, §1), to Dionysius of Rome (*ibid.*
§6), to Xystus of Rome (chap. 9, §1), and to Xystus and the church of
Rome (*ibid.* §6).

<span id="fn_2179"></span>[295:2180](2010223.htm#fr_2179.md) <span

<span id="iii.xii.vi-p15"></span> Dionysius afterward became Xystus’
successor as bishop of Rome. See below, chap. 27, note 2.

<span id="fn_2181"></span>[295:2182](2010223.htm#fr_2181.md) <span
id="iii.xii.vi-p15.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.vi-p16"></span> Of this Philemon we know only that he
was a presbyter of Rome at this time (see below, chap. 7, §1). A
fragment from Dionysius’ epistle to him on the subject of baptism is
quoted in that chapter.
