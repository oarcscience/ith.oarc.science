Augustus to Sapor, King of the Persians, containing a truly Pious

<span id="iv.vi.iv.ix-p2"></span>Copy of his Letter to the King of

id="iv.vi.iv.ix-p3.1"></span>“By</span> keeping the Divine faith, I am
made a partaker of the light of truth: guided by the light of truth, I
advance in the knowledge of the Divine faith. Hence it is that, as my
actions themselves evince, I profess the most holy religion; and this
worship I declare to be that which teaches me deeper acquaintance with
the most holy God; aided by whose Divine power, beginning from the very
borders of the ocean, I have aroused each nation of the world in
succession to a well-grounded hope of security; so that those which,
groaning in servitude to the most cruel tyrants and yielding to the
pressure of their daily sufferings, had well nigh been utterly
destroyed, have been restored through my agency to a far happier state.
This God I confess that I hold in unceasing honor and remembrance; this
God I delight to contemplate with pure and guileless thoughts in the
height of his glory.
