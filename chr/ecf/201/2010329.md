<span id="iii.xvii.xxii-p1"></span> On Bk. X. chap. 8, § 4 (note I, a).

<span id="iii.xvii.xxii-p2"></span>After Constantine’s victory over
Maxentius, his half-sister Constantia, daughter of Constantius Chlorus
by his second wife, Theodora, was married to Licinius, and thus the
alliance of the two emperors was cemented by family ties. Constantius
Chlorus was a grandson of Crispus, brother of the Emperor Claudius II.,
and hence could claim to be, in a sense, of imperial extraction; a fact
which gave him a dignity beyond that of his colleagues, who were all of
comparatively low birth. Constantine himself and his panegyrists always
made much of his illustrious descent.
