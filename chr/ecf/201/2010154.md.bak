id="iii.x.xiv-Page_227"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.x.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIII.—</span>*Rhodo and his Account
of the Dissension of Marcion.*

<span id="iii.x.xiv-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.x.xiv-p2.1"></span>At</span> this time Rhodo, <span
id="fr_1534"></span>[1535](#fn_1534.md) a native of Asia, who had been
instructed, as he himself states, by Tatian, with whom we have already
become acquainted, <span id="fr_1535"></span>[1536](#fn_1535.md) having
written several books, published among the rest one against the heresy
of Marcion. <span id="fr_1536"></span>[1537](#fn_1536.md) He says that this
heresy was divided in his time into various opinions; <span
id="fr_1537"></span>[1538](#fn_1537.md) and while describing those who
occasioned the division, he refutes accurately the falsehoods devised by
each of them.

<span id="iii.x.xiv-p8"></span>2. But hear what he writes: <span
id="fr_1538"></span>[1539](#fn_1538.md)

<span id="iii.x.xiv-p10"></span>“Therefore also they disagree among
themselves, maintaining an inconsistent opinion. <span
id="fr_1539"></span>[1540](#fn_1539.md) For Apelles, <span
id="fr_1540"></span>[1541](#fn_1540.md) one of the herd, priding himself on
his manner of life <span id="fr_1541"></span>[1542](#fn_1541.md) and his
age, acknowledges one principle, <span
id="fr_1542"></span>[1543](#fn_1542.md) but says that the prophecies <span
id="fr_1543"></span>[1544](#fn_1543.md) are from an opposing spirit, being
led to this view by the responses of a maiden by name Philumene, <span
id="fr_1544"></span>[1545](#fn_1544.md) who was possessed by a <span
id="page_228">p. 228</span> <span id="iii.x.xiv-Page_228"></span>demon.

<span id="iii.x.xiv-p17"></span>3. But others, among whom are Potitus
and Basilicus, <span id="fr_1545"></span>[1546](#fn_1545.md) hold to two
principles, <span id="fr_1546"></span>[1547](#fn_1546.md) as does the
mariner <span id="fr_1547"></span>[1548](#fn_1547.md) Marcion himself.

<span id="iii.x.xiv-p21"></span>4. These following the wolf <span
id="fr_1548"></span>[1549](#fn_1548.md) of Pontus, and, like him, unable to
fathom the division of things, became reckless, and without giving any
proof asserted two principles. Others, again, drifting into a worse
error, consider that there are not only two, but three natures. <span
id="fr_1549"></span>[1550](#fn_1549.md) Of these, Syneros <span
id="fr_1550"></span>[1551](#fn_1550.md) is the leader and chief, as those
who defend his teaching <span id="fr_1551"></span>[1552](#fn_1551.md) say.”

<span id="iii.x.xiv-p26"></span>5. The same author writes that he
engaged in conversation with Apelles. He speaks as follows:

<span id="iii.x.xiv-p27"></span>“For the old man Apelles, when
conversing with us, <span id="fr_1552"></span>[1553](#fn_1552.md) was
refuted in many things which he spoke falsely; whence also he said that
it was not at all necessary to examine one’s doctrine, <span
id="fr_1553"></span>[1554](#fn_1553.md) but that each one should continue
to hold what he believed. For he asserted that those who trusted in the
Crucified would be saved, if only they were found doing good
works. <span id="fr_1554"></span>[1555](#fn_1554.md) But as we have said
before, his opinion concerning God was the most obscure of all. For he
spoke of one principle, as also our doctrine does.”

<span id="iii.x.xiv-p32"></span>6. Then, after stating fully his own
opinion, he adds:

<span id="iii.x.xiv-p33"></span>“When I said to him, Tell me how you
know this or how can you assert that there is one principle, he replied
that the prophecies refuted themselves, because they have said nothing
true; <span id="fr_1555"></span>[1556](#fn_1555.md) for they are
inconsistent, and false, and self-contradictory. But how there is one
principle he said that he did not know, but that he was thus persuaded.

<span id="iii.x.xiv-p35"></span>7. As I then adjured him to speak the
truth, he swore that he did so when he said that he did not know how
there is one unbegotten God, but that he believed it. Thereupon I
laughed and reproved him because, though calling himself a teacher, he
knew not how to confirm what he taught.” <span
id="fr_1556"></span>[1557](#fn_1556.md)

<span id="iii.x.xiv-p37"></span>8. In the same work, addressing
Callistio, <span id="fr_1557"></span>[1558](#fn_1557.md) the same writer
acknowledges that he had been instructed at Rome by Tatian. <span
id="fr_1558"></span>[1559](#fn_1558.md) And he says that a book of
Problems <span id="fr_1559"></span>[1560](#fn_1559.md) had been prepared by
Tatian, in which he promised to explain the ob<span id="page_229">p.
229</span> <span id="iii.x.xiv-Page_229"></span>scure and hidden parts
of the divine Scriptures. Rhodo himself promises to give in a work of
his own solutions of Tatian’s problems. <span
id="fr_1560"></span>[1561](#fn_1560.md) There is also extant a Commentary
of his on the Hexæmeron. <span id="fr_1561"></span>[1562](#fn_1561.md)

<span id="iii.x.xiv-p43"></span>9. But this Apelles wrote many things,
in an impious manner, of the law of Moses, blaspheming the divine words
in many of his works, being, as it seemed, very zealous for their
refutation and overthrow. <span id="fr_1562"></span>[1563](#fn_1562.md)

<span id="iii.x.xiv-p45"></span>So much concerning these.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1534"></span>[227:1535](2010154.htm#fr_1534.md) <span
id="iii.x.xiv-p2.2"></span>

<span id="iii.x.xiv-p3"></span> We know nothing of Rhodo except what is
contained in this chapter. Jerome gives a very brief account of him in
his *de vir. ill.* 37, but it rests solely upon this chapter, with the
single addition of the statement that Rhodo wrote a work *Against the
Phrygians.* It is plain enough, however, that he had for his account no
independent source, and that he in this statement simply attributed to
Rhodo the work quoted by Eusebius as an anonymous work in chap. 16.
Jerome permits himself such unwarranted combinations very frequently,
and we need not be at all surprised at it. With him a guess is often as
good as knowledge, and in this case he doubtless considered his guess a
very shrewd one. There is no warrant for supposing that he himself saw
the work mentioned by Eusebius, and thus learned its authorship. What
Eusebius did not learn from it he certainly could not, and his whole
account betrays the most slavish and complete dependence upon Eusebius
as his only source. In chap. 39 Jerome mentions Rhodo again as
referring, in a book which he wrote against Montanus, Prisca, and
Maximilla, to Miltiades, who also wrote against the same heretics. This
report is plainly enough taken directly from Eusebius, chap. 17, where
Eusebius quotes from the same anonymous work. Jerome’s utterly baseless
combination is very interesting, and significant of his general method.

<span id="iii.x.xiv-p4"></span>Rhodo’s works are no longer extant, and
the only fragments we have are those preserved by Eusebius in this
chapter.

<span id="fn_1535"></span>[227:1536](2010154.htm#fr_1535.md) <span

<span id="iii.x.xiv-p5"></span> See Bk. IV. chap. 29.

<span id="fn_1537"></span>[227:1538](2010154.htm#fr_1537.md) <span
id="iii.x.xiv-p6.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.xiv-p7"></span> It is noticeable that Rhodo says <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.x.xiv-p7.1"></span>γνώμας</span>,
*opinions,* not *parties.* Although the different Marcionites held
various theoretical beliefs, which gave rise to different schools, yet
they did not split up into sects, but remained one church, and retained
the one general name of Marcionites, and it is by this general name
alone that they are always referred to by the Fathers. The fact that
they could hold such variant beliefs (e.g. one, two, or three
principles; see below, note 9) without splitting up into sects, shows
that doctrines were but a side issue with them, and that the religious
spirit was the matter upon which they laid the chief emphasis. This
shows the fundamental difference between Marcion and the Gnostics.

<span id="fn_1538"></span>[227:1539](2010154.htm#fr_1538.md) <span
id="iii.x.xiv-p8.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.xiv-p9"></span> These fragments of Rhodo are collected
and discussed by Routh in his *Rel. Sacræ,* I. 437–446.

<span id="fn_1539"></span>[227:1540](2010154.htm#fr_1539.md) <span
id="iii.x.xiv-p10.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.xiv-p11"></span> The Fathers entirely misunderstood
Marcion, and mistook the significance of his movement. They regarded it,
like Gnosticism in general, solely as a speculative system, and entirely
overlooked its practical aim. The speculative and theological was not
the chief thing with Marcion, but it is the only thing which receives
any attention from his opponents. His positions, all of which were held
only with a practical interest, were not treated by him in a speculative
manner, nor were they handled logically and systematically. As a
consequence, many contradictions occur in them. These contradictions
were felt by his followers, who laid more and more emphasis upon the
speculative over against the practical; and hence, as Rhodo reports,
they fell into disagreement, and, in their effort to remove the
inconsistencies, formed various schools, differing among themselves
according to the element upon which the greatest weight was laid. There
is thus some justification for the conduct of the Fathers, who naturally
carried back and attributed to Marcion the principles of his followers.
But it is our duty to distinguish the man from his followers, and to
recognize his greatness in spite of their littleness. Not all of them,
however, fell completely away from his practical religious spirit.
Apelles, as we shall see below, was in many respects a worthy follower
of his master.

<span id="fn_1540"></span>[227:1541](2010154.htm#fr_1540.md) <span
id="iii.x.xiv-p11.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.xiv-p12"></span> Apelles was the greatest and most
famous of Marcion’s disciples. Tertullian wrote a special work against
him, which is unfortunately lost, but from his own quotations, and from
those of Pseudo-Tertullian and Hippolytus, it can be in part restored
(cf. Harnack’s *De Apellis Gnosis Monarchia,* p. 11 sqq.). As he was an
old man (see §5, below) when Rhodo conversed with him, he must have been
born early in the second century. We know nothing definite either as to
his birth or death. The picture which we have of him in this chapter is
a very pleasing one. He was a man evidently of deep religious spirit and
moral life, who laid weight upon “trust in the crucified Christ” (see
§5, below), and upon holiness in life in distinction from doctrinal
beliefs; a man who was thus thoroughly Marcionitic in his principles,
although he differed so widely with Marcion in some of his doctrinal
positions that he was said to have founded a new sect (so Origen, *Hom.
in Gen.* II. 2). The slightest difference, however, between his teaching
and Marcion’s would have been sufficient to make him the founder of a
separate Gnostic sect in the eyes of the Fathers, and therefore this
statement must be taken with allowance (see note 4, above). The account
which Hippolytus (*Phil.* X. 16) gives of the doctrinal positions of
Apelles is somewhat different from that of Rhodo, but ambiguous and less
exact. The scandal in regard to him, reported by Tertullian in his *De
Præscriptione,* 30, is quite in accord with Tertullian’s usual conduct
towards heretics, and may be set aside as not having the slightest
foundation in fact, and as absolutely contradicting what we know of
Apelles from this report of his contemporary, Rhodo. His moral character
was certainly above reproach, and the same may be said of his master,
Marcion. Upon Apelles, see especially Harnack’s *De Apellis Gnosis
Monarchia,* Lips. 1874.

<span id="fn_1541"></span>[227:1542](2010154.htm#fr_1541.md) <span
id="iii.x.xiv-p12.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.xiv-p13"></span> The participle (<span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.x.xiv-p13.1"></span>σεμνυνόμενος</span>)
carries with it the implication that Apelles’ character was affected or
assumed. The implication, however, does not lessen the value of Rhodo’s
testimony to his character. He could not deny its purity, though he
insinuated that it was not sincere.

<span id="fn_1542"></span>[227:1543](2010154.htm#fr_1542.md) <span
id="iii.x.xiv-p13.2"></span>

<span id="iii.x.xiv-p14"></span> This means that Apelles accepted only
one God, and made the creator but an angel who was completely under the
power of the Supreme God. Marcion, on the contrary, held, as said below,
two principles, teaching that the world-creator was himself a God,
eternal, uncreated, and independent of the good God of the Christians.
It is true that Marcion represented the world-creator as limited in
power and knowledge, and taught that the Christian God would finally be
supreme, and the world-creator become subject to him; but this, while it
involves Marcion in self-contradiction as soon as the matter is looked
at theoretically, yet does not relieve him from the charge of actual
dualism. His followers were more consistent, and either accepted one
principle, subordinating the world-creator completely to the good God,
as did Apelles, or else carried out Marcion’s dualism to its logical
result and asserted the continued independence of the Old Testament God
and the world-creator, who was thus very early identified with Satan and
made the enemy of the Christian God. (Marcion’s world-creator was not
the bad God, but the righteous in distinction from the good God.) Still
others held three principles: the good God of the Christians, the
righteous God or world-creator, and the bad God, Satan. The varying
doctrines of these schools explain the discrepant and often
contradictory reports of the Fathers in regard to the doctrines of
Marcion. Apelles’ doctrine was a decided advance upon that of Marcion,
as he rejected the dualism of the latter, which was the destructive
element in his system, and thus approached the Church, whose foundation
must be *one* God who rules the world for good. His position is very
significant, as remarked by Harnack, because it shows that one could
hold Marcion’s fundamental principle without becoming a dualist.

<span id="fn_1543"></span>[227:1544](2010154.htm#fr_1543.md) <span
id="iii.x.xiv-p14.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.xiv-p15"></span> i.e. the Old Testament prophecies.
Apelles in his *Syllogisms* (see below, note 28) exhibited the supposed
contradictions of the Old Testament in syllogistic form, tracing them to
two adverse angels, of whom the one spoke falsely, contradicting the
truth spoken by the other. Marcion, on the other hand (in his
*Antitheses*), referred all things to the same God, the world-creator,
and from the contradictions of the book endeavored to show his
vacillating and inconsistent character. He, however, accepted the Old
Testament as in the main a trustworthy book, but referred the prophecies
to the Jewish Messiah in distinction from the Christ of the New
Testament. But Apelles, looking upon two adverse angels as the authors
of the book, regarded it as in great part false. Marcion and Apelles
were one, however, in looking upon it as an anti-Christian book.

<span id="fn_1544"></span>[227:1545](2010154.htm#fr_1544.md) <span
id="iii.x.xiv-p15.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.xiv-p16"></span> This virgin, Philumene, is connected
with Apelles in all the reports which we have of him (e.g. in
Hippolytus, Tertullian, Jerome, &c.), and is reported to have been
looked upon by Apelles as a prophetess who received revelations from an
angel, and who worked miracles. Tertullian, *De Præscriptione,* 6,
evidently accepts these miracles as facts, but attributes them to the
agency of a demon. They all unite in considering her influence the cause
of Apelles’ heretical opinions. Tertullian (*ibid.* 30, &c.) calls her a
prostitute, but the silence of Rhodo and Hippolytus is sufficient
refutation of such a charge, and it may be rejected as a baseless
slander, like the report of Apelles’ immorality mentioned in note 7.
There is nothing strange in the fact that Apelles should follow the
prophecies of a virgin, and the Fathers who mention it evidently do not
consider it as anything peculiar or reprehensible in itself. It was very
common in the early Church to appeal to the relatives of virgins and
widows. Cf. e.g. the virgin daughters of Philip who prophesied (<span
id="iii.x.xiv-p16.1"></span>[Acts xxi.
9](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#009.md)<span id="iii.x.xiv-p16.2"></span>;
Eusebius, III. 31), also the *Eccles. Canons,* chap. 21, where it is
directed that three widows shall be appointed, of whom two shall give
themselves to prayer, waiting for revelations in regard to any question
which may arise in the Church, and the third shall devote herself to
nursing the sick. Tertullian also appeals for proof of the materiality
of the soul to a vision enjoyed by a Christian sister (*de Anima,* 9).
So Montanus had his prophetesses Priscilla and Maximilla (see the next
chapter).

<span id="fn_1545"></span>[228:1546](2010154.htm#fr_1545.md) <span
id="iii.x.xiv-p17.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.xiv-p18"></span> Of these two men we know only what is
told us here. They are not mentioned elsewhere.

<span id="fn_1546"></span>[228:1547](2010154.htm#fr_1546.md) <span
id="iii.x.xiv-p18.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.xiv-p19"></span> See note 9.

<span id="fn_1547"></span>[228:1548](2010154.htm#fr_1547.md) <span
id="iii.x.xiv-p19.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.xiv-p20"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.x.xiv-p20.1"></span>ὁ</span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.x.xiv-p20.2"></span>ναύτης</span>. This word is omitted by many
<span class="c13"><span id="iii.x.xiv-p20.3"></span>mss.</span>, but is
found in the best ones and in Rufinus, and is accepted by most of the
editors of Eusebius. Tertullian calls Marcion a ship-master (*Adv.
Marc.* III. 6, and IV. 9, &c.) and a pilot (*ibid.* I. 18), and makes
many plays upon his profession (e.g. *ibid.* V. 1), and there is no
reason to take the word in a figurative sense (as has been done) and
suppose that he is called a mariner simply because of his nationality.
We know that he traveled extensively, and that he was a rich man (for he
gave 200,000 sesterces at one time to the church of Rome, which was a
large sum for those days; see Tertullian, *de Præscript.* 30). There is,
therefore, no reason to doubt that he was a “ship-master,” as Tertullian
calls him.

<span id="fn_1548"></span>[228:1549](2010154.htm#fr_1548.md) <span
id="iii.x.xiv-p21.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.xiv-p22"></span> It was the custom of the Fathers to
call the heretics hard names, and Marcion received his full share of
them from his opponents, especially from Tertullian. He is compared to a
wolf by Justin also, *Apol.* I. 58, on account of his “carrying away” so
many “lambs” from the truth.

<span id="fn_1549"></span>[228:1550](2010154.htm#fr_1549.md) <span

<span id="fn_1550"></span>[228:1551](2010154.htm#fr_1550.md) <span
id="iii.x.xiv-p23.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.xiv-p24"></span> Of Syneros we know only what is told us
here. He is not mentioned elsewhere. Had the Marcionites split into
various sects, these leaders must have been well known among the
Fathers, and their names must have been frequently referred to. As it
was, they all remained Marcionites, in spite of their differences of
opinion (see above, note 4).

<span id="fn_1551"></span>[228:1552](2010154.htm#fr_1551.md) <span

<span id="iii.x.xiv-p25"></span> <span class="Greek"><span

the majority of the <span class="c13"><span

Burton and Schwegler read <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.x.xiv-p25.3"></span>διδασκαλεῖον</span>, on the authority of two
<span class="c13"><span id="iii.x.xiv-p25.4"></span>mss.</span>

<span id="fn_1552"></span>[228:1553](2010154.htm#fr_1552.md) <span
id="iii.x.xiv-p27.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.xiv-p28"></span> Apelles was evidently like Marcion in
his desire to keep within the Church as much as possible, and to
associate with Church people. He had no esoteric doctrines to conceal
from the multitude, and in this he shows the great difference between
himself and the Gnostics. Marcion did not leave the Church until he was
obliged to, and he founded his own church only under compulsion, upon
being driven out of the Catholic community.

<span id="fn_1553"></span>[228:1554](2010154.htm#fr_1553.md) <span
id="iii.x.xiv-p28.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.xiv-p29"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.x.xiv-p29.1"></span>τὸν λόγον</span>.

<span id="fn_1554"></span>[228:1555](2010154.htm#fr_1554.md) <span
id="iii.x.xiv-p29.2"></span>

<span id="iii.x.xiv-p30"></span> This is a truly Christian sentiment,
and Apelles should be honored for the expression of it. It reveals
clearly the religious character of Marcionism in distinction from the
speculative and theological character of the Gnostics, and indeed of
many of the Fathers. With Marcion and Apelles we are in a world of
sensitive moral principle and of deep religious feeling like that in
which Paul and Augustine lived, but few others in the early Church.
Rhodo, in spite of his orthodoxy, shows himself the real Gnostic over
against the sincere believer, though the latter was in the eyes of the
Church a “blasphemous heretic.” Apelles’ noble words do honor to the
movement—however heretical it was—which in that barren age of theology
could give them birth.

<span id="iii.x.xiv-p31"></span>The latter clause, taken as it stands,
would seem to indicate an elevation of good works to the level of faith;
but though it is possible that Apelles may have intended to express
himself thus, it is more probable, when we remember the emphasis which
Marcion laid upon Paul’s doctrine of salvation by the grace of God
alone, that he meant to do no more than emphasize good works as a
natural result of true faith, as we do to-day. The apparent
co-ordination of the two may perhaps lie simply in Rhodo’s reproduction
of Apelles’ words. He, at least, did not comprehend Paul’s grand
doctrine of Christian liberty, nor did any of his orthodox
contemporaries. The difference between the common conception of Christ’s
relation to the law, and the conception of Paul as grasped by Marcion
and perhaps by Apelles, is well illustrated by a passage in Tertullian,
in which he expresses astonishment that the Marcionites do not sin
freely, so long as they do not expect to be punished, and exclaims (to
his own dishonor), “I would sin without scruple, if I believed as you
do.”

<span id="fn_1555"></span>[228:1556](2010154.htm#fr_1555.md) <span
id="iii.x.xiv-p33.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.xiv-p34"></span> Rhodo had probably brought forward
against Apelles proof from prophecy which led to the discussion of the
Old Testament prophecies in general. Although Apelles had rejected
Marcion’s dualism, and accepted the “one principle,” he still rejected
the Old Testament. This is quite peculiar, and yet perfectly
comprehensible; for while Marcion was indeed the only one of that age
that understood Paul, yet as Harnack well says, even he misunderstood
him; and neither himself nor his followers were able to rise to Paul’s
noble conception of the Old Testament law as a “schoolmaster to bring us
to Christ,” and thus a part of the good God’s general plan of salvation.
It took, perhaps, a born Jew, as Paul was, to reach that high conception
of the law in those days. To Marcion and his followers the law seemed to
stand in irreconcilable conflict with the Gospel,—Jewish law on the one
side, Gospel liberty on the other,—they could not reconcile them; they
must, therefore, reject the former as from another being, and not from
the God of the Gospel. There was in that age no historical
interpretation of the Old Testament. It must either be interpreted
allegorically, and made a completely Christian book, or else it must be
rejected as opposed to Christianity. Marcion and his followers, in their
conception of law and Gospel as necessarily opposed, could follow only
the latter course. Marcion, in his rejection of the Old Testament,
proceeded simply upon dogmatic presumptions. Apelles, although his
rejection of it undoubtedly originated in the same presumptions, yet
subjected it to a criticism which satisfied him of the correctness of
his position, and gave him a fair basis of attack. His procedure was,
therefore, more truly historical than that of Marcion, and anticipated
modern methods of higher criticism.

<span id="iii.x.xiv-p36"></span> A true Gnostic sentiment, over against
which the pious “agnosticism” of Apelles is not altogether unrefreshing.
The Church did not fully conquer Gnosticism,—Gnosticism in some degree
conquered the Church, and the anti-Gnostics, like Apelles, were called
heretics. It was the vicious error of Gnosticism that it looked upon
Christianity as knowledge, that it completely identified the two, and
our existing systems of theology, some of them, testify to the fact that
there are still Gnostics among us.

<span id="iii.x.xiv-p38"></span> Of this Callistio we know nothing; but,
as has been remarked by another, he must have been a well-known man, or
Eusebius would probably have said “a certain Callistio” (see Salmon’s
article in Smith and Wace).

do not know. The work is mentioned by no one else, and Eusebius
evidently had no knowledge of its existence, or he would have said so.

<span id="iii.x.xiv-p42"></span> <span class="Greek"><span

of Rhodo’s, on the *Hexæmeron* (or *six days’ work),* is mentioned by no
one else, and no fragments of it are known to us. For a notice of other
works on the same subject, see below, Bk. VI. chap. 22, note 3.

<span id="iii.x.xiv-p44"></span> Hippolytus (X. 16) also mentions works
of Apelles against the law and the prophets. We know of but one work of
his, viz. the *Syllogisms,* which was devoted to the criticism of the
Old Testament, and in which he worked out the antitheses of Marcion in a
syllogistic form. The work is cited only by Origen (*in Gen.* II. 2) and
by Ambrose (*De Parad.* V. 28), and they have preserved but a few brief
fragments. It must have been an extensive work, as Ambrose quotes from
the 38th book. From these fragments we can see that Apelles’ criticism
of the Old Testament was very keen and sagacious. For the difference
between himself and Marcion in the treatment of the Old Testament, see
above, note 9. The words of Eusebius, “as it seemed,” show that he had
not himself seen the book, as might indeed be gathered from his general
account of Apelles, for which he depended solely upon secondary sources.
