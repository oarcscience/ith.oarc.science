<span id="iii.xiv.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xiv.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter I.</span>

<span id="iii.xiv.ii-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xiv.ii-p2.1"></span>The</span> first of the martyrs of Palestine
was Procopius, <span id="fr_2616"></span>[2617](#fn_2616.md) who, before he
had received the trial of imprisonment, immediately on his first
appearance before the governor’s tribunal, having been ordered to
sacrifice to the so-called gods, declared that he knew only one to whom
it was proper to sacrifice, as he himself wills. But when he was
commanded to offer libations to the four emperors, having quoted a
sentence which displeased them, he was immediately beheaded. The
quotation was from the poet: <span id="page_343">p. 343</span> <span
id="iii.xiv.ii-Page_343"></span>“The rule of many is not good; let there
be one ruler and one king.” <span id="fr_2617"></span>[2618](#fn_2617.md)

<span id="iii.xiv.ii-p7"></span>2. It was the seventh <span
id="fr_2618"></span>[2619](#fn_2618.md) day of the month Desius, <span
id="fr_2619"></span>[2620](#fn_2619.md) the seventh before the ides of
June, <span id="fr_2620"></span>[2621](#fn_2620.md) as the Romans reckon,
and the fourth day of the week, when this first example was given at
Cæsarea in Palestine.

<span id="iii.xiv.ii-p11"></span>3. Afterwards, <span
id="fr_2621"></span>[2622](#fn_2621.md) in the same city, many rulers of
the country churches readily endured terrible sufferings, and furnished
to the beholders an example of noble conflicts. But others, benumbed in
spirit by terror, were easily weakened at the first onset. Of the rest,
each one endured different forms of torture, as scourgings without
number, and rackings, and tearings of their sides, and insupportable
fetters, by which the hands of some were dislocated.

<span id="iii.xiv.ii-p13"></span>4. Yet they endured what came upon
them, as in accordance with the inscrutable purposes of God. For the
hands of one were seized, and he was led to the altar, while they thrust
into his right hand the polluted and abominable offering, and he was
dismissed as if he had sacrificed. Another had not even touched it, yet
when others said that he had sacrificed, he went away in silence.
Another, being taken up half dead, was cast aside as if already dead,
and released from his bonds, and counted among the sacrificers. When
another cried out, and testified that he would not obey, he was struck
in the mouth, and silenced by a large band of those who were drawn up
for this purpose, and driven away by force, even though he had not
sacrificed. Of such consequence did they consider it, to seem by any
means to have accomplished their purpose.

<span id="iii.xiv.ii-p14"></span>5. Therefore, of all this number, the
only ones who were honored with the crown of the holy martyrs were
Alphæus and Zacchæus. <span id="fr_2622"></span>[2623](#fn_2622.md) After
stripes and scrapings and severe bonds and additional tortures and
various other trials, and after having their feet stretched for a night
and day over four holes in the stocks, <span
id="fr_2623"></span>[2624](#fn_2623.md) on the seventeenth day of the month
Dius, <span id="fr_2624"></span>[2625](#fn_2624.md) —that is, according to
the Romans, the fifteenth before the Kalends of December,—having
confessed one only God and Christ Jesus as king, <span
id="fr_2625"></span>[2626](#fn_2625.md) as if they had uttered some
blasphemy, they were beheaded like the former martyr.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_2616"></span>[342:2617](2010272.htm#fr_2616.md) <span
id="iii.xiv.ii-p2.2"></span>

<span id="iii.xiv.ii-p3"></span> The account of Procopius was somewhat
fuller in the longer recension of the *Martyrs of Palestine,* as can be
seen from the Syriac version (English translation in Cureton, p. 3 sq.).
There exists also a Latin translation of the Acts of St. Procopius,
which was evidently made from that longer recension, and which is
printed by Valesius and also by Cureton (p. 50 sq.), and in English by
Crusè *in loco.* We are told by the Syriac version that his family was
from Baishan. According to the Latin, he was a native of Ælia
(Jerusalem), but resided in Scythopolis (the Greek name of Baishan).
With the Latin agrees the Syriac version of these Acts, which is
published by Assemani in his *Acta SS. Martt. Orient. et Occident.* ed.
1748, Part II. p. 169 sq. (see Cureton, p. 52). We learn from the longer
account that he was a lector, interpreter, and exorcist in the church,
and that he was exceedingly ascetic in his manner of life. It is clear
from this paragraph that Procopius was put to death, not because he was
a Christian, but because he uttered words apparently treasonable in
their import. To call him a Christian martyr is therefore a misuse of
terms. We cannot be sure whether Procopius was arrested under the terms
of the first or under the terms of the second edict. If in consequence
of the first, it may be that he was suspected of complicity in the plot
which Diocletian was endeavoring to crush out, or that he had interfered
with the imperial officers when they undertook to execute the decree for
the destruction of the church buildings. The fact that he was commanded
by the governor to sacrifice would lead us to think of the first, rather
than of the second edict (see above, Bk. VIII. chap. 6, note 3, and
chap. 2, note 8). Still, it must be admitted that very likely many
irregularities occurred in the methods by which the decrees were
executed in the province, and the command to sacrifice can, therefore,
not be claimed as proving that he was not arrested under the terms of
the second edict; and in fact, the mention of imprisonment as the
punishment which he had to expect would lead us to think of the second
edict as at least the immediate occasion of his arrest. In any case,
there is no reason to suppose that his arrest would have resulted in his
death had he not been rash in his speech.

<span id="iii.xiv.ii-p4"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xiv.ii-p4.1"></span>οὐκ ἀγαθὸν πολυκοιρανίη εἷς κοίρανος
žστω,</span>

<span id="iii.xiv.ii-p5"></span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xiv.ii-p5.1"></span>εἷς βασιλεύς</span>.

<span id="iii.xiv.ii-p6"></span>The sentence is from Homer’s *Iliad,*
Bk. II. vers. 204 and 205. It was a sort of proverb, like many of
Homer’s sayings, and was frequently quoted. As a consequence the use of
it by Procopius does not prove at all his acquaintance with Homer or
Greek literature in general.

<span id="fn_2618"></span>[343:2619](2010272.htm#fr_2618.md) <span
id="iii.xiv.ii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xiv.ii-p8"></span> The majority of the <span
class="c13"><span id="iii.xiv.ii-p8.1"></span>mss.</span> read “eighth,”
which according to Eusebius’ customary mode of reckoning the Macedonian
months is incorrect. For, as Valesius remarks, he always synchronizes
the Macedonian with the Roman months, as was commonly done in his time.
But the seventh before the Ides of June is not the eighth, but the
seventh of June (or Desius). In fact, a few good <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xiv.ii-p8.2"></span>mss.</span> read “seventh” instead of
“eighth,” and I have followed Burton, Schwegler, and Heinichen in
adopting that reading.

<span id="fn_2619"></span>[343:2620](2010272.htm#fr_2619.md) <span
id="iii.xiv.ii-p8.3"></span>

<span id="iii.xiv.ii-p9"></span> Desius was the tenth month of the
Macedonian year, and corresponded to our June (see the table on p. 403,
below).

<span id="fn_2620"></span>[343:2621](2010272.htm#fr_2620.md) <span
id="iii.xiv.ii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xiv.ii-p10"></span> On the Roman method of reckoning the
days of the month, see below, p. 402.

<span id="fn_2621"></span>[343:2622](2010272.htm#fr_2621.md) <span
id="iii.xiv.ii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xiv.ii-p12"></span> We may gather from §5, below, that the
sufferings to which Eusebius refers in such general terms in this and
the following paragraphs took place late in the year 303. In fact, from
the Syriac version of the longer recension (Cureton, p. 4) we learn that
the tortures inflicted upon Alphæus and Zacchæus were, in consequence of
the third edict, issued at the approach of the emperor’s vicennalia, and
intended rather as a step toward amnesty than as a sharpening of the
persecution (see above, Bk. VIII. chap. 5, note 8). This leads us to
conclude that all the tortures mentioned in these paragraphs had the
same occasion, and this explains the eagerness of the judges to set the
prisoners free, even if they had not sacrificed, so long as they might
be made to appear to have done so, and thus the law not be openly
violated. Alphæus and Zacchæus alone suffered death, as we are told in
§5, and they evidently on purely political grounds (see note 10).

<span id="fn_2622"></span>[343:2623](2010272.htm#fr_2622.md) <span
id="iii.xiv.ii-p14.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xiv.ii-p15"></span> We learn from the Syriac version that
Zacchæus was a deacon of the church of Gadara, and that Alphæus belonged
to a noble family of the city of Eleutheropolis, and was a reader and
exorcist in the church of Cæsarea.

<span id="fn_2623"></span>[343:2624](2010272.htm#fr_2623.md) <span
id="iii.xiv.ii-p15.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xiv.ii-p16"></span> See above, Bk. IV. chap. 16, note 9.

<span id="fn_2624"></span>[343:2625](2010272.htm#fr_2624.md) <span
id="iii.xiv.ii-p16.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xiv.ii-p17"></span> The month Dius was the third month of
the Macedonian year, and corresponded with our November (see below, p.
403).

<span id="fn_2625"></span>[343:2626](2010272.htm#fr_2625.md) <span
id="iii.xiv.ii-p17.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xiv.ii-p18"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xiv.ii-p18.1"></span>μόνον ἕνα Θεὸν καὶ χριστὸν βασιλέα ᾽Ιησοῦν
ὁμολογησ€ντες</span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xiv.ii-p18.2"></span>Βασιλεύς</span> was the technical term for
emperor, and it is plain enough from this passage that these two men,
like Procopius, were beheaded because they were regarded as guilty of
treason, not because of their religious faith. The instances given in
this chapter are very significant, for they reveal the nature of the
persecution during its earlier months, and throw a clear light back upon
the motives which had led Diocletian to take the step against the
Christians which he did.
