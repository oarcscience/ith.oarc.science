<span id="iii.ix.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.ix.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—</span>*Ecclesiastical
Writers*.

<span id="iii.ix.viii-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.ix.viii-p2.1"></span>Among</span> these Hegesippus was well
known. <span id="fr_1036"></span>[1037](#fn_1036.md) We have already quoted
his words a number of times, <span id="fr_1037"></span>[1038](#fn_1037.md)
relating events which happened in the time of the apostles according to
his account.

<span id="iii.ix.viii-p5"></span>2. He records in five books the true
tradition of apostolic doctrine in a most simple style, and he indicates
the time in which he flourished when he writes as follows concerning
those that first set up idols: “To whom they erected cenotaphs and
temples, as is done to the present day. Among whom is also
Antinoüs, <span id="fr_1038"></span>[1039](#fn_1038.md) a slave of the
Emperor Adrian, in whose honor are celebrated also the Antinoian games,
which were instituted in our day. For he \[i.e. Adrian\] also founded a
city named after Antinoüs, <span id="fr_1039"></span>[1040](#fn_1039.md)
and appointed prophets.”

<span id="iii.ix.viii-p8"></span>3. At the same time also Justin, a
genuine lover of the true philosophy, was still continuing to busy
himself with Greek literature. <span
id="fr_1040"></span>[1041](#fn_1040.md) He indicates this time in the
Apology which he addressed to Antonine, where he writes as
follows: <span id="fr_1041"></span>[1042](#fn_1041.md) “We do not think it
out of place to mention here Antinoüs also, who lived in our day, and
whom all <span id="page_181">p. 181</span> <span
id="iii.ix.viii-Page_181"></span>were driven by fear to worship as a
god, although they knew who he was and whence he came.”

<span id="iii.ix.viii-p11"></span>4. The same writer, speaking of the
Jewish war which took place at that time, adds the following: <span
id="fr_1042"></span>[1043](#fn_1042.md) “For in the late Jewish war
Barcocheba, the leader of the Jewish rebellion, commanded that
Christians alone <span id="fr_1043"></span>[1044](#fn_1043.md) should be
visited with terrible punishments unless they would deny and blaspheme
Jesus Christ.”

<span id="iii.ix.viii-p14"></span>5. And in the same work he shows that
his conversion from Greek philosophy to Christianity <span
id="fr_1044"></span>[1045](#fn_1044.md) was not without reason, but that it
was the result of deliberation on his part. His words are as
follows: <span id="fr_1045"></span>[1046](#fn_1045.md) “For I myself, while
I was delighted with the doctrines of Plato, and heard the Christians
slandered, and saw that they were afraid neither of death nor of
anything else ordinarily looked upon as terrible, concluded that it was
impossible that they could be living in wickedness and pleasure. For
what pleasure-loving or intemperate man, or what man that counts it good
to feast on human flesh, could welcome death that he might be deprived
of his enjoyments, and would not rather strive to continue permanently
his present life, and to escape the notice of the rulers, instead of
giving himself up to be put to death?”

<span id="iii.ix.viii-p17"></span>6. The same writer, moreover, relates
that Adrian having received from Serennius Granianus, <span
id="fr_1046"></span>[1047](#fn_1046.md) a most distinguished governor, a
letter <span id="fr_1047"></span>[1048](#fn_1047.md) in behalf of the
Christians, in which he stated that it was not just to slay the
Christians without a regular accusation and trial, merely for the sake
of gratifying the outcries of the populace, sent a rescript <span
id="fr_1048"></span>[1049](#fn_1048.md) to Minucius Fundanus, <span
id="fr_1049"></span>[1050](#fn_1049.md) proconsul of Asia, commanding him
to condemn no one without an indictment and a well-grounded accusation.

<span id="iii.ix.viii-p23"></span>7. And he gives a copy of the epistle,
preserving the original Latin in which it was written, <span
id="fr_1050"></span>[1051](#fn_1050.md) and prefacing it with the following
words: <span id="fr_1051"></span>[1052](#fn_1051.md) “Although from the
epistle of the greatest and most illustrious Emperor Adrian, your
father, we have good ground to demand that you order judgment to be
given as we have desired, yet we have asked this not because it was
ordered by Adrian, but rather because we know that what we ask is just.
And we have subjoined the copy of Adrian’s epistle that you may know
that we are <span id="page_182">p. 182</span> <span
id="iii.ix.viii-Page_182"></span>speaking the truth in this matter also.
And this is the copy.”

<span id="iii.ix.viii-p26"></span>8. After these words the author
referred to gives the rescript in Latin, which we have translated into
Greek as accurately as we could. <span
id="fr_1052"></span>[1053](#fn_1052.md) It reads as follows:

<span id="iii.ix.viii-p3"></span> On the life and writings of
Hegesippus, see below, chap. 22, note 1. Eusebius in this passage puts
his literary activity too early (see above, chap. 7, note 10). Jerome
follows Eusebius’ chronological arrangement in his *de vir ill.,* giving
an account of Hegesippus in chap. 22, between his accounts of Agrippa
Castor and Justin Martyr.

<span id="iii.ix.viii-p6"></span> Antinoüs, a native of Bithynia, was a
beautiful page of the Emperor Hadrian, and the object of his extravagant
affections. He was probably drowned in the Nile, in 130 <span
class="c13"><span id="iii.ix.viii-p6.1"></span>a.d.</span> After his
death he was raised to the rank of the gods, and temples were built for
his worship in many parts of the empire, especially in Egypt. In Athens
too games were instituted in his honor, and games were also celebrated
every fifth year at Mantinea, in Arcadia, according to Valesius, who
cites Pausanias as his authority.

<span id="fn_1039"></span>[180:1040](2010117.htm#fr_1039.md) <span
id="iii.ix.viii-p6.2"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.viii-p7"></span> Hadrian rebuilt the city of Besa in
the Thebais, in whose neighborhood Antinoüs was drowned, and called it
Antinoöpolis.

<span id="iii.ix.viii-p9"></span> On Justin Martyr, see chap. 16, below.
We do not know the date of his conversion, but as it did not take place
until mature years, it is highly probable that he was still a heathen
during the greater part of Hadrian’s reign. There is no reason, however,
to suppose that Eusebius is speaking here with more than approximate
accuracy. He may not have known any better than we the exact time of
Justin’s conversion.

is, as Münter remarks, not to be understood as implying that Barcocheba
did not treat the Greeks and Romans also with cruelty, but that he
persecuted the Christians especially, from religious hate, if he could
not compel them to apostatize. Moreover, he handled the Christians so
roughly because of their hesitation to take part in the rebellion”
(Closs).

id="iii.ix.viii-p15.3"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.viii-p16"></span> Justin, *Apol.* II. 12. Eusebius here
quotes from what is now known as the Second Apology of Justin, but
identifies it with the first, from which he has quoted just above. This
implies that the two as he knew them formed but one work, and this is
confirmed by his quotations in chaps. 16 and 17, below. For a discussion
of this matter, see chap. 18, note 3.

<span id="fn_1046"></span>[181:1047](2010117.htm#fr_1046.md) <span
id="iii.ix.viii-p17.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.viii-p18"></span> The best <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.ix.viii-p18.1"></span>mss.</span> of Eusebius write the name
<span class="Greek"><span id="iii.ix.viii-p18.2"></span>Σερέννιος
Γρανιανός</span>, but one <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.ix.viii-p18.3"></span>ms.</span>, supported by Syncellus, writes
the first word Σερένιος. Rufinus writes “Serenius”; Jerome, in his
version of Eusebius’ *Chronicle,* followed by Orosius (VII. 13), writes
“Serenius Granius,” and this, according to Kortholdt (quoted by
Heinichen), is shown by an inscription to have been the correct form
(see Heinichen’s edition, *in loco*). We know no more of this man,
except that he was Minucius Fundanus’ predecessor as proconsul of Asia,
as we learn from the opening sentence of the rescript quoted in the next
chapter.

<span id="iii.ix.viii-p19"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.ix.viii-p19.1"></span>γρ€μματα</span>. The plural is often used
like the Latin *literæ* to denote a single epistle and we learn from the
opening sentence of the rescript itself (if the Greek of Eusebius is to
be relied on) that Hadrian replies, not to a number of letters, but to a
single one,—an <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.ix.viii-p19.2"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.ix.viii-p19.3"></span>πιστολή</span>, as Eusebius calls it.

<span id="fn_1048"></span>[181:1049](2010117.htm#fr_1048.md) <span
id="iii.ix.viii-p19.4"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.viii-p20"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.ix.viii-p20.1"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.ix.viii-p20.2"></span>ντιγρ€ψαι</span>

<span id="fn_1049"></span>[181:1050](2010117.htm#fr_1049.md) <span
id="iii.ix.viii-p20.3"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.viii-p21"></span> This Minucius Fundanus is the same
person that is addressed by Pliny, *Ep.* I. 9 (see Mommsen’s note in
Keil’s ed. of Pliny’s epistles, p. 419). He is mentioned also by Melito
(Eusebius, IV. 26) as proconsul of Asia, and it is there said that
Hadrian wrote to him concerning the Christians. The authenticity of this
rescript is a disputed point. Keim (*Theol. Jahrbücher,* 1856, p. 387
sqq.) was the first to dispute its genuineness. He has been followed by
many scholars, especially Overbeck, who gives a very keen discussion of
the various edicts of the early emperors relating to the Christians in
his *Studien zur Gesch. der alten Kirche,* I. p. 93 sqq. The genuineness
of the edict, however, has been defended against Keim’s attack by
Wieseler, Renan, Lightfoot, and others. The whole question hinges upon
the interpretation of the rescript. According to Gieseler, Neander, and
some others, it is aimed only against tumultuous proceedings, and, far
from departing from the principle laid down by Trajan, is an attempt to
return to that principle and to substitute orderly judicial processes
for popular attacks. If this be the sense of the edict, there is no
reason to doubt its genuineness, but the next to the last sentence
certainly cannot be interpreted in that way: “if any one therefore
brings an accusation, and shows that they have done something contrary
to the laws (<span class="Greek"><span id="iii.ix.viii-p21.1"></span>τι
παρὰ τοὺς νόμους</span>) determine thus *according to the heinousness of
the crime*” (<span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.ix.viii-p21.2"></span>κατὰ τὴν δύναμιν τοῦ ἁμαρτήματος</span>).
These last words are very significant. They certainly imply various
crimes of which the prisoners are supposed to be accused. According to
the heinousness of these crimes the punishment is to be regulated. In
other words, the trial of the Christians was to be for the purpose of
ascertaining whether they were guilty of moral or political crimes, not
whether they merely professed Christianity; that is, the profession of
Christianity, according to this rescript, is not treated as a crime in
and of itself. If the edict then be genuine, Hadrian reversed completely
Trajan’s principle of procedure which was to punish the profession of
Christianity in and of itself as a crime. But in the time of Antoninus
Pius and Marcus Aurelius the rescript of Trajan is seen still to be in
full force. For this and other reasons presented by Keim and Overbeck, I
am constrained to class this edict with those of Antoninus Pius and
Marcus Aurelius as a forgery. It can hardly have been composed while
Hadrian was still alive, but must have been forged before Justin wrote
his Apology, for he gives it as a genuine edict, i.e. it must belong to
the early part of the reign of Antoninus Pius.

<span id="iii.ix.viii-p22"></span>The illusion under which the early
Christian writers labored in regard to the relations of the emperors to
Christianity is very remarkable. Both Melito and Tertullian state that
no emperor had persecuted the Christians except Nero and Domitian.
Christian writers throughout the second century talk in fact as if the
mode of treatment which they were receiving was something new and
strange, and in opposition to the better treatment which previous
emperors had accorded the Christians. In doing this, they ignore
entirely the actual edicts of the emperors, all of which are now lost
and notice only forged edicts which are favorable to the Christians;
when and by whom they were forged we do not know. Thus Tertullian, in
addressing Septimius Severus, speaks of the favors which his
predecessors had granted the Christians and contrasts their conduct with
his; Melito addresses Marcus Aurelius in the same way, and so Justin
addresses Antoninus Pius. This method probably arose from a
misunderstanding of the original edict of Trajan (cf. Bk. III. chap. 33,
note 6), which they all considered favorable, and therefore presupposed
a friendly attitude on the part of the emperors toward the Christians,
which, not finding in their own age, they naturally transferred to a
previous age. This led gradually to the idea—which Lactantius first
gives precise expression to—that only the bad emperors persecuted
Christianity, while the good ones were favorable to it. But after the
empire became Christian, the belief became common that all the heathen
emperors had been persecutors, the good as well as the bad;—all the
Christian emperors were placed upon one level, and all the heathen on
another, the latter being looked upon, like Nero and Domitian, as wicked
tyrants. Compare Overbeck, *l.c.*

<span id="fn_1050"></span>[181:1051](2010117.htm#fr_1050.md) <span
id="iii.ix.viii-p23.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.viii-p24"></span> Our two <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.ix.viii-p24.1"></span>mss.</span> of Justin have substituted the
Greek translation of Eusebius for the Latin original given by the
former. Rufinus, however, in his version of Eusebius’ *History,* gives a
Latin translation which is very likely the original one. Compare
Kimmel’s *De Rufino,* p. 175 sq., and Lightfoot’s *Ignatius,* I. p. 463
sq., and see Otto’s *Corpus Apol.* I. p. 190 sq., where the edict is
given, both in the Greek of our <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.ix.viii-p24.2"></span>mss.</span> of Justin and in the Latin of
Rufinus. Keim (*Aus dem Urchristenthum,* p. 184 sq.) contends that the
Latin of Rufinus is not the original, but a translation of Eusebius’
Greek. His arguments, however, do not possess any real weight, and the
majority of scholars accept Kimmel’s view.

<span id="fn_1051"></span>[181:1052](2010117.htm#fr_1051.md) <span
id="iii.ix.viii-p24.3"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.viii-p25"></span> Justin, *Apol.* I. 68.

<span id="fn_1052"></span>[182:1053](2010117.htm#fr_1052.md) <span
id="iii.ix.viii-p26.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.viii-p27"></span> We cannot judge as to the
faithfulness of the Greek translation which follows, because we are not
absolutely sure whether the Latin of Rufinus is its original, or itself
a translation of it. Eusebius and Rufinus, however, agree very well, and
if the Latin of Rufinus is the original of Eusebius’ translation, the
latter has succeeded much better than the Greek translator of the
*Apology* of Tertullian referred to in Bk. II. chap. 2, above. We should
expect, however, that much greater pains would be taken with the
translation of a brief official document of this kind than with such a
work as Tertullian’s *Apology,* and Eusebius’ translation of the
rescript does not by any means prove that he was a fluent Latin scholar.
As remarked above (Bk. II. chap. 2, note 9), he probably had
comparatively little acquaintance with the Latin, but enough to enable
him to translate brief passages for himself in cases of necessity.
