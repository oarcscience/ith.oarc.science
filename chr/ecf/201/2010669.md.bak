<span id="iv.vii.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vii.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII</span>.—*In regard to Things
above our Comprehension, we should glorify the Creator’s Wisdom, and
attribute their Causes to him alone, and not to Chance.*

<span id="iv.vii.vii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vii.vii-p2.1"></span>In</span> fact, this word “chance” is the
expression of men who think in haphazard and illogical fashion; who are
unable to understand the causes of these things, and who, owing to the
feebleness of their own apprehensions, conceive that those things for
which they cannot assign a reason, are ordered without reason. There
are, unquestionably, some things which possess wonderful natural
properties, and the full apprehension of which is very difficult: for
example, the nature of hot springs. For no one can easily explain the
cause of so powerful a fire; and it is indeed surprising that though
surrounded on all sides by a body of cold water, it loses none of its
native heat. These phenomena appear to be of rare occurrence throughout
the world, being intended, I am persuaded, to afford to mankind
convincing evidence of the power of that Providence which ordains that
two directly opposite natures, heat and cold, should thus proceed from
the self-same source. Many indeed, yea, numberless, are the gifts which
God has bestowed for the comfort and enjoyment of man; and of these the
fruit of the olive-tree and the vine deserve especial notice; the one
for its power of renovating and cheering the soul, <span
id="fr_3403"></span>[3404](#fn_3403.md) the other because it ministers to
our enjoyment, and is likewise adapted for the cure of bodily disease.
Marvelous, too, is the course of rivers, flowing night and day with
unceasing motion, and presenting a type of ever-flowing, never-ceasing
life: and equally wonderful is the alternate succession of day and
night.

<span id="iv.vii.vii-p3"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.vii.vii-p3.1"></span>ψυχῆς</span> = “soul.” In the absence of a
proper Biblical psychology the word has been most sadly abused in
translations. The only way back to a proper conception of the words
“spirit” and “soul” and “life,” &c., is to re-establish a uniform
rendering for them. It is as bad as the rendering of our English
version, where *nephesk* (= <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.vii.vii-p3.2"></span>ψυχή</span>) is rendered “life.”
