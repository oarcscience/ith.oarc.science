<span id="iii.viii.xiii-p3"></span> Vespasian reigned from July 1 (if
his reign be dated from the time he was proclaimed emperor in Egypt; if
from the death of Vitellius, Dec. 20), 69, to June 24, 79 <span
class="c13"><span id="iii.viii.xiii-p3.1"></span>a.d.</span>

<span id="fn_698"></span>[147:699](2010082.htm#fr_698.md) <span
id="iii.viii.xiii-p3.2"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.xiii-p4"></span> In his *Chron.* (Armenian) Eusebius
gives the length of Linus’ episcopate as fourteen years, while Jerome
gives it as eleven years. Both figures are about equally reliable; see
above, chap. 2, note 1.

<span id="fn_699"></span>[147:700](2010082.htm#fr_699.md) <span
id="iii.viii.xiii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.xiii-p5"></span> Of Anencletus, or Cletus, as he is
also called, we know nothing more than that he was one of the
traditional first three bishops of Rome. Hippolytus makes two bishops,
Anencletus and Cletus, out of the one man, and he is followed by the
Roman Catholic Church (see above, chap. 2, note 1). According to chap.
15, Anencletus held office twelve years.

<span id="fn_700"></span>[147:701](2010082.htm#fr_700.md) <span
id="iii.viii.xiii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.xiii-p6"></span> Titus died Dec. 13, <span
class="c13"><span id="iii.viii.xiii-p6.1"></span>a.d.</span> 81. He
therefore reigned two years and six months, instead of two years and two
months as Eusebius states.
