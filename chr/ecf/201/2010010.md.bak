<span id="iii.iii.i.iv-p1"></span>§4. *Eusebius’ Accession to the
Bishopric of Cæsarea.*

<span id="iii.iii.i.iv-p2"></span>Not long after the close of the
persecution, Eusebius became bishop of Cæsarea in Palestine, his own
home, and held the position until his death. The exact date of his
accession cannot be ascertained, indeed we cannot say that it did not
take place even before the close of the persecution, but that is hardly
probable; in fact, we know of no historian who places it earlier than
313. His immediate predecessor in the episcopate was Agapius, whom he
mentions in terms of praise in *H. E.* VII. 32. Some writers have
interpolated a bishop Agricolaus between Agapius and Eusebius (see
*e.g.* Tillemont, *Hist. Eccles.* VII. 42), on the ground that his name
appears in one of the lists of those present at the Council of Ancyra
(c. 314), as bishop of Cæsarea in Palestine (see *Labbei et Cossartii
Conc.* I. 1475). But, as Hefele shows (*Conciliengesch.* I. 220), this
list is of late date and not to be relied upon. On the other hand, as
Lightfoot points out, in the *Libellus Synodicus* (*Conc*. I. 1480),
where Agricolaus is said to have been present at the Council of Ancyra,
he is called bishop of Cæsarea in Cappadocia; and this statement is
confirmed by a Syriac list given in Cowper’s *Miscellanies,* p. 41.
Though perhaps no great reliance is to be <span id="page_11">p.
11</span> <span id="iii.iii.i.iv-Page_11"></span>placed upon the
correctness of any of these lists, the last two may at any rate be set
over against the first, and we may conclude that there exists no ground
for assuming that Agapius, who is the last Cæsarean bishop mentioned by
Eusebius, was not the latter’s immediate predecessor. At what time
Agapius died we do not know. That he suffered martyrdom is hardly
likely, in view of Eusebius’ silence on the subject. It would seem more
likely that he outlived the persecution. However that may be, Eusebius
was already bishop at the time of the dedication of a new and elegant
Church at Tyre under the direction of his friend Paulinus, bishop of
that city. Upon this occasion he delivered an address of considerable
length, which he has inserted in his *Ecclesiastical History,* Bk. X.
chap. 4. He does not name himself as its author, but the way in which he
introduces it, and the very fact that he records the whole speech
without giving the name of the man who delivered it, make its origin
perfectly plain. Moreover, the last sentence of the preceding chapter
makes it evident that the speaker was a bishop: “Every one of the rulers
(<span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.iii.i.iv-p2.1"></span>ἀρχόντων</span>) present delivered
panegyric discourses.” The date of the dedication of this church is a
matter of dispute, though it is commonly put in the year 315. It is
plain from Eusebius’ speech that it was uttered before Licinius had
begun to persecute the Christians, and also, as Görres remarks, at a
time when Constantine and Licinius were at least outwardly at peace with
each other. In the year 314 the two emperors went to war, and
consequently, if the persecution of Licinius began soon after that
event, as it is commonly supposed to have done, the address must have
been delivered before hostilities opened; that is, at least as early as
314, and this is the year in which Görres places it (*Kritische
Untersuchungen ueber die licinianische Christenverfolgung*, p. 8). But
if Görres’ date (319 <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.iii.i.iv-p2.2"></span>a.d.</span>) for the commencement of the
persecution be accepted (and though he can hardly be said to have proved
it, he has urged some strong grounds in support of it), then the address
may have been delivered at almost any time between 315 and 319, for, as
Görres himself shows, Licinius and Constantine were outwardly at peace
during the greater part of that time (*ib*. p. 14, sq.). There is
nothing in the speech itself which prevents this later date, nor is it
intrinsically improbable that the great basilica reached completion only
in 315 or later. In fact, it must be admitted that Eusebius may have
become bishop at any time between about 311 and 318.

<span id="iii.iii.i.iv-p3"></span>The persecution of Licinius, which
continued until his defeat by Constantine, in 323, was but local, and
seems never to have been very severe. Indeed, it did not bear the
character of a bloody persecution, though a few bishops appear to have
met their death on one ground or another. Palestine and Egypt seem not
to have suffered to any great extent (see Görres, *ib*. p. 32 sq.).
