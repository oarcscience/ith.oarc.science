id="iv.vi.iv.lxxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter LXXV</span>.—*He surpassed all
Preceding Emperors in Devotion to God.*

<span id="iv.vi.iv.lxxv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.lxxv-p2.1"></span>Standing</span>, as he did, alone and
pre-eminent among the Roman emperors as a worshiper of God; alone as the
bold proclaimer to all men of the doctrine of Christ; having alone
rendered honor, as none before him had ever done, to his Church; having
alone abolished utterly the error of polytheism, and discountenanced
idolatry in every form: so, alone among them both during life and after
death, was he accounted worthy of such honors as none can say have been
attained to by any other; so that no one, whether Greek or Barbarian,
nay, of the ancient Romans themselves, has ever been presented to us as
worthy of comparison with him. <span

<span id="iv.vi.iv.lxxv-p3"></span> The sharp sarcasms of Julian’s
*Cæsars* seem almost to have taken their text from this challenge. He
marshals the great emperors before the gods, where each presents his
claim to greatness. Constantine is greatly ridiculed, and yet to choose
between Julian and Eusebius, if regard is had to Constantine’s real
effect on world history, Eusebius is the truer judge, and is at least
not so far wrong that his superlative enthusiasm for his imperial friend
cannot be readily pardoned.
