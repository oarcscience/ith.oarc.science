<span id="iv.vi.iii.v-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V</span>.—*Of the Disagreement
respecting the Celebration of Easter.*

<span id="iv.vi.iii.v-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.v-p2.1"></span>But</span> before this time another most
virulent disorder had existed, and long afflicted the <span
id="page_521">p. 521</span> <span
id="iv.vi.iii.v-Page_521"></span>Church; I mean the difference
respecting the salutary feast of Easter. <span
id="fr_3233"></span>[3234](#fn_3233.md) For while one party asserted that
the Jewish custom should be adhered to, the other affirmed that the
exact recurrence of the period should be observed, without following the
authority of those who were in error, and strangers to gospel grace.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.v-p4"></span>Accordingly, the people being thus in
every place divided in respect of this, <span
id="fr_3234"></span>[3235](#fn_3234.md) and the sacred observances of
religion confounded for a long period (insomuch that the diversity of
judgment in regard to the time for celebrating one and the same feast
caused the greatest disagreement between those who kept it, some
afflicting themselves with fastings and austerities, while others
devoted their time to festive relaxation), no one appeared who was
capable of devising a remedy for the evil, because the controversy
continued equally balanced between both parties. To God alone, the
Almighty, was the healing of these differences an easy task; and
Constantine appeared to be the only one on earth capable of being his
minister for this good end. For as soon as he was made acquainted with
the facts which I have described, and perceived that his letter to the
Alexandrian Christians had failed to produce its due effect, he at once
aroused the energies of his mind, and declared that he must prosecute to
the utmost this war also against the secret adversary who was disturbing
the peace of the Church.
