id="iv.vi.iii.xxxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXVI</span>.—*Description of
the Walls, Roof, Decoration, and Gilding of the Body of the Church.*

id="iv.vi.iii.xxxvi-p2.1"></span>For</span> at the side opposite to the
cave, which was the eastern side, the church itself was erected; a noble
work rising to a vast height, and of great extent both in length and
breadth. The interior of this structure was floored with marble slabs of
various colors; while the external surface of the walls, which shone
with polished stones exactly fitted together, exhibited a degree of
splendor in no respect inferior to that of marble. With regard to the
roof, it was covered on the outside with lead, as a protection against
the rains of winter. But the inner part of the roof, which was finished
with sculptured panel work, extended in a series of connected
compartments, like a vast sea, over the whole church; <span

the purest gold, caused the entire building to glitter as it were with
rays of light.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.xxxvi-p3"></span> It would seem from this
description that the paneling was like that of Santa Maria Maggiore at
Rome, a horizontal surface rather than the pointed roof paneled.
