<span id="iii.iii.i.i-p3"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.iii.i.i-p3.1"></span>§ 1.</span> *Sources and Literature*

<span id="iii.iii.i.i-p4"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.iii.i.i-p4.1"></span>Acacius</span>, the pupil and successor of
Eusebius in the bishopric of Cæsarea, wrote a life of the latter (Socr.
*H. E*. II. 4) which is unfortunately lost. He was a man of ability
(Sozomen *H. E.* III. 2, IV. 23) and had exceptional opportunities for
producing a full and accurate account of Eusebius’ life; the
disappearance of his work is therefore deeply to be regretted.

<span id="iii.iii.i.i-p5"></span>Numerous notices of Eusebius are found
in the works of Socrates, Sozomen, Theodoret, Athanasius, Jerome, and
other writers of his own and subsequent ages, to many of which
references will be made in the following pages. A collection of these
notices, made by Valesius, is found in English translation on p. 57 sq.
of this volume. The chief source for a knowledge of Eusebius’ life and
character is to be found in his own works. These will be discussed
below, on p. 26 sq. Of the numerous modern works which treat at greater
or less length of the life of Eusebius I shall mention here only those
which I have found most valuable.

*Eusebius of Cæsarea,* in *Smith and Wace’s Dictionary of Christian
Biography,* vol. II. pp. 308–348. Lightfoot’s article is a magnificent
monument of patristic scholarship and contains the best and most
exhaustive treatment of the life and writings of Eusebius that has been
written.

<span id="iii.iii.i.i-p15"></span>The student may be referred finally to
all the larger histories of the Church (*e.g.* Schaff, vol. III. 871
sqq. and 1034 sq.), which contain more or less extended accounts of
Eusebius.
