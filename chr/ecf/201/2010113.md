<span id="iii.ix.iv-p5"></span> Known as Sixtus I. (Sixtus, or Sistus,
being the Latin form of the name) in the list of Roman bishops. He was
supposed to be the author of a collection of religious and moral maxims,
which were widely read in the ancient Church and are mentioned by many
of the Fathers. His authorship was disputed by Jerome and others, and
the work from that time on was commonly assigned to a heathen author,
until recently some voices have again been heard in favor of the
authorship of Bishop Sixtus (notably de Lagarde and Ewald). See Schaff’s
*Church Hist*. II. p. 703 sq.

<span id="iii.ix.iv-p6"></span>He is, according to Lipsius, the first
Roman bishop whose dates we have any means of ascertaining, and it may
be assumed that he was the first one that occupied an episcopal position
in Rome; and yet, even in his time, the monarchical episcopate can
hardly have been established in its full sense. In the next chapter we
are told that he held office ten years; and this figure, which is
supported by most of the ancient catalogues, may be accepted as
approximately correct. The date of his accession given here by Eusebius
cannot, however, be correct; for, as Lipsius has shown (*Chron. de röm.
Bischöfe*, p. 183 sq.) he must have died at least as early as 126 <span
class="c13"><span id="iii.ix.iv-p6.1"></span>a.d.</span> (possibly as
early as 124), so that his accession took place not later than 116; that
is, before the death of Trajan. Like most of the other early Roman
bishops he is celebrated as a martyr in the martyrologies, but the fact
of his martyrdom rests upon a very late and worthless tradition.

id="iii.ix.iv-p6.2"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.iv-p7"></span> On Primus, see chap. 1, note 4. Eusebius
contradicts his own dates here. For in chap. 1 he says that Alexander of
Rome and Primus of Alexandria became bishops at the same time; but
according to this chapter, Alexander died at the close of the tenth year
of his episcopate, and Primus in the twelfth year of his. Eusebius may
have used the word “about” advisedly, to cover considerable ground, and
may have grouped the two bishops together simply for convenience’ sake.
No reliance is to be placed upon the dates in any case.

<span id="fn_992"></span>[176:993](2010113.htm#fr_992) <span
id="iii.ix.iv-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.iv-p8"></span> We know nothing about Justus except that
he ruled eleven years, according to the next chapter. If Primus died in
the twelfth year of his episcopate, as Eusebius says in this chapter,
and entered upon his office in the twelfth year of Trajan, as he says in
chapter 1, Justus must have become bishop about 120 <span
class="c13"><span id="iii.ix.iv-p8.1"></span>a.d</span>., in the third
or fourth year of Hadrian. It must be remembered, however, that all of
these dates are historically worthless.
