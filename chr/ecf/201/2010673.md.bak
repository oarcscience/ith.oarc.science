id="iv.vii.xi-Page_568"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vii.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI</span>.—*On the Coming of our Lord
in the Flesh; its Nature and Cause.* <span
id="fr_3414"></span>[3415](#fn_3414.md)

<span id="iv.vii.xi-p3"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vii.xi-p3.1"></span>Whoever</span>, then, has pursued a course
unworthy of a life of virtue, and is conscious of having lived an
irregular and disorderly life, let him repent, and turn with enlightened
spiritual vision to God; and let him abandon his past career of
wickedness, content if he attain to wisdom even in his declining years.
We, however, have received no aid from human instruction; nay, whatever
graces of character are esteemed of good report by those who have
understanding, are entirely the gift of God. And I am able to oppose no
feeble buckler against the deadly weapons of Satan’s armory; I mean the
knowledge I possess of those things which are pleasing to him: and of
these I will select such as are appropriate to my present design, while
I proceed to sing the praises of the Father of all. But do thou, O
Christ, Saviour of mankind, be present to aid me in my hallowed task!
Direct the words which celebrate thy virtues, <span
id="fr_3415"></span>[3416](#fn_3415.md) and instruct me worthily to sound
thy praises. And now, let no one expect to listen to the graces of
elegant language: for well I know that the nerveless eloquence of those
who speak to charm the ear, and whose aim is rather applause than sound
argument, is distasteful to hearers of sound judgment. It is asserted,
then, by some profane and senseless persons, that Christ, whom we
worship, was justly condemned to death, and that he who is the author of
life to all, was himself deprived of life. That such an assertion should
be made by those who have once dared to enter the paths of impiety, who
have cast aside all fear, and all thought of concealing their own
depravity, is not surprising. But it is beyond the bounds of folly
itself that they should be able, as it seems, really to persuade
themselves that the incorruptible God yielded to the violence of men,
and not rather to that love alone which he bore to the human race: that
they should fail to perceive that divine magnanimity and forbearance is
changed by no insult, is moved from its intrinsic steadfastness by no
revilings; but is ever the same, breaking down and repelling, by the
spirit of wisdom and greatness of soul, the savage fierceness of those
who assail it. The gracious kindness of God had determined to abolish
iniquity, and to exalt order and justice. Accordingly, he gathered a
company of the wisest among men, <span
id="fr_3416"></span>[3417](#fn_3416.md) and ordained that most noble and
useful doctrine, which is calculated to lead the good and blessed of
mankind to an imitation of his own providential care. And what higher
blessing can we speak of than this, that God should prescribe the way of
righteousness, and make those who are counted worthy of his instruction
like himself; that goodness might be communicated to all classes of
mankind, and eternal felicity be the result? This is the glorious
victory: this the true power: this the mighty work, worthy of its
author, the restoration of all people to soundness of mind: and the
glory of this triumph we joyfully ascribe to thee, thou Saviour of all!
But thou, vile and wretched blasphemy, whose glory is in lies and rumors
and calumny; thy power is to deceive and prevail with the inexperience
of youth, and with men who still retain the folly of youth. These thou
seducest from the service of the true God, and settest up false idols as
the objects of their worship and their prayers; and thus the reward of
their folly awaits thy deluded victims: for they calumniate Christ, the
author of every blessing, who is God, and the Son of God. Is not the
worship of the best and wisest of the nations of this world worthily
directed to that God, who, while possessing boundless power, remains
immovably true to his own purpose, and retains undiminished his
characteristic kindness and love to man? Away, then, ye impious, for
still ye may while vengeance on your transgressions is yet withheld;
begone to your sacrifices, your feasts, your scenes of revelry and
drunkenness, wherein, under the semblance of religion, your hearts are
devoted to profligate enjoyment, and pretending to perform sacrifices,
yourselves are the willing slaves of your own pleasures. No knowledge
have ye of any good, nor even of the first commandment of the mighty
God, who both declares his will to man, and gives commission to his Son
to direct the course of human life, that they who have passed a career
of virtue and self-control may obtain, according to the judgment of that
Son, a second, yea, a blessed and happy existence. <span
id="fr_3417"></span>[3418](#fn_3417.md) I have now declared the decree of
God respecting the life which he prescribes to man, neither ignorantly,
as many have done, nor <span id="page_569">p. 569</span> <span
id="iv.vii.xi-Page_569"></span>resting on the ground of opinion or
conjecture. But it may be that some will ask, Whence this title of Son?
Whence this generation of which we speak, if God be indeed only One, and
incapable of union with another? We are, however, to consider generation
as of two kinds; one in the way of natural birth, which is known to all;
the other, that which is the effect of an eternal cause, the mode of
which is seen by the prescience of God, and by those among men whom he
loves. For he who is wise will recognize the cause which regulates the
harmony of creation. Since, then, nothing exists without a cause, of
necessity the cause of existing substances preceded their existence. But
since the world and all things that it contains exist, and are
preserved, <span id="fr_3418"></span>[3419](#fn_3418.md) their preserver
must have had a prior existence; so that Christ is the cause of
preservation, and the preservation of things is an effect: <span
id="fr_3419"></span>[3420](#fn_3419.md) even as the Father is the cause of
the Son, and the Son the effect of that cause. Enough, then, has been
said to prove his priority of existence. But how do we explain his
descent to this earth, and to men? His motive in this, <span
id="fr_3420"></span>[3421](#fn_3420.md) as the prophets had foretold,
originated in his watchful care for the interests of all: for it needs
must be that the Creator should care for his own works. But when the
time came for him to assume a terrestrial body, and to sojourn on this
earth, the need requiring, he devised for himself a new mode <span
id="fr_3421"></span>[3422](#fn_3421.md) of birth. Conception was there, yet
apart from marriage: childbirth, yet pure virginity: and a maiden became
the mother of God! An eternal nature received a beginning of temporal
existence: a sensible form of a spiritual essence, a material
manifestation of incorporeal brightness, <span
id="fr_3422"></span>[3423](#fn_3422.md) appeared. Alike wondrous were the
circumstances which attended this great event. A radiant dove, like that
which flew from the ark of Noah, <span
id="fr_3423"></span>[3424](#fn_3423.md) alighted on the Virgin’s bosom: and
accordant with this impalpable union, purer than chastity, more
guileless than innocence itself, were the results which followed. From
infancy possessing the wisdom of God, received with reverential awe by
the Jordan, in whose waters he was baptized, gifted with that royal
unction, the spirit of universal intelligence; with knowledge and power
to perform miracles, and to heal diseases beyond the reach of human art;
he yielded a swift and unhindered assent to the prayers of men, to whose
welfare, indeed, his whole life was devoted without reserve. His
doctrines instilled, not prudence only, <span
id="fr_3424"></span>[3425](#fn_3424.md) but real wisdom: his hearers were
instructed, not in the mere social virtues, <span
id="fr_3425"></span>[3426](#fn_3425.md) but in the ways which conduct to
the spiritual world; and devoted themselves to the contemplation of
immutable and eternal things, and the knowledge of the Supreme Father.
The benefits which he bestowed were no common blessings: for blindness,
the gift of sight; for helpless weakness, the vigor of health; in the
place of death, restoration to life again. I dwell not on that abundant
provision in the wilderness, whereby a scanty measure of food became a
complete and enduring supply <span id="fr_3426"></span>[3427](#fn_3426.md)
for the wants of a mighty multitude. <span
id="fr_3427"></span>[3428](#fn_3427.md) Thus do we render thanks to thee,
our God and Saviour, according to our feeble power; unto thee, O Christ,
supreme Providence of the mighty Father, who both savest us from evil,
and impartest to us thy most blessed doctrine: for I say these things,
not to praise, but to give thanks. For what mortal is he who shall
worthily declare thy praise, of whom we learn that thou didst from
nothing call creation into being, and illumine it with thy light; that
thou didst regulate the confusion of the elements by the laws of harmony
and order? But chiefly we mark thy loving-kindness, <span
id="fr_3428"></span>[3429](#fn_3428.md) in that thou hast caused those
<span id="page_570">p. 570</span> <span
id="iv.vii.xi-Page_570"></span>whose hearts inclined to thee to desire
earnestly a divine and blessed life, and hast provided that, like
merchants of true blessings, they might impart to many others the wisdom
and good fortune they had received; themselves, meanwhile, reaping the
everlasting fruit of virtue. Freed from the trammels of vice, and imbued
with the love of their fellow-men, they keep mercy ever before their
eyes, and hoping for the promises of faith; <span
id="fr_3429"></span>[3430](#fn_3429.md) devoted to modesty, and all those
virtues which the past career of human life had thrown aside \[but which
were now restored by him whose providence is over all\]. <span
id="fr_3430"></span>[3431](#fn_3430.md) No other power could be found to
devise a remedy for such evils, and for that spirit of injustice which
had heretofore asserted its dominion over the race of men. Providence,
however, could reach the circumstances even here, and with ease restored
whatever had been disordered by violence and the licentiousness of human
passion. And this restoring power he exercised without concealment. For
he knew that, though there were some whose thoughts were able to
recognize and understand his power, others there were whose brutish and
senseless nature led them to rely exclusively on the testimony of their
own senses. In open day, therefore, that no one, whether good or evil,
might find room for doubt, he manifested his blessed and wondrous
healing power; restoring the dead to life again, and renewing with a
word the powers of those who had been bereft of bodily sense. <span
id="fr_3431"></span>[3432](#fn_3431.md) Can we, in short, suppose, that to
render the sea firm as the solid ground, to still the raging of the
storm, and finally to ascend to heaven, after turning the unbelief of
men to steadfast faith by the performance of these wondrous acts,
demanded less than almighty power, was less than the work of God? Nor
was the time of his passion unaccompanied by like wonders: when the sun
was darkened, and the shades of night obscured the light of day. Then
terror everywhere laid hold upon the people, and the thought that the
end of all things was already come, and that chaos, such as had been ere
the order of creation began, would once more prevail. Then, too, the
cause was sought of so terrible an evil, and in what respect the
trespasses of men had provoked the wrath of Heaven; until God himself,
who surveyed with calm dignity the arrogance of the ungodly, renewed the
face of heaven, and adorned it with the host of stars. Thus the
beclouded face of Nature was again restored to her pristine beauty.

<span id="iv.vii.xi-p2"></span> One <span class="c13"><span
id="iv.vii.xi-p2.1"></span>ms.</span> adds, “and concerning those who
did not know this mystery.” In another the chapter is divided, and this
is the heading of the second part.

<span id="fn_3415"></span>[568:3416](2010673.htm#fr_3415.md) <span
id="iv.vii.xi-p3.2"></span>

<span id="iv.vii.xi-p4"></span> Or “this discourse concerning virtue.”

<span id="fn_3416"></span>[568:3417](2010673.htm#fr_3416.md) <span
id="iv.vii.xi-p4.1"></span>

<span id="iv.vii.xi-p5"></span> \[Alluding to the apostles, who are
called in the beginning of ch. 15, “the best men of their age.” Were it
our province to criticise, we might notice the contrariety of such
expressions as these to the account which Scripture gives us of those
“unlearned and ignorant men,” the feeble, and, in themselves, fallible
instruments, whom God selected to further his wondrous designs of mercy
to a ruined world.—*Bag.*\] Were it in our province to criticise the
critic, we might notice that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of
wisdom, and refer to the whole Book of Proverbs. Any just conception of
wisdom or true learning says the same thing. The man who knows that God
and not <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.vii.xi-p5.1"></span>φύσις</span> or <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.vii.xi-p5.2"></span>τύχη</span> manages the universe, is more
learned than the wisest of those learned in things which are not so.

<span id="fn_3417"></span>[568:3418](2010673.htm#fr_3417.md) <span
id="iv.vii.xi-p5.3"></span>

<span id="iv.vii.xi-p6"></span> Christophorson extends ch. 10 to this
point, and here introduces ch. 11, with the heading “On the coming of
Our Lord in the flesh; its nature and cause.”

<span id="fn_3418"></span>[569:3419](2010673.htm#fr_3418.md) <span
id="iv.vii.xi-p6.1"></span>

<span id="iv.vii.xi-p7"></span> Preserved, preserver, and preservation =
saved, saviour, and salvation. This represents the N.T. idea better than
the popular conception which confuses Christ our Saviour with Christ our
Redeemer. Redemption was a necessary part of his effort for our
salvation, but the salvation itself was a saving, in literal English
preserving. We have been redeemed; we are being saved.

<span id="fn_3419"></span>[569:3420](2010673.htm#fr_3419.md) <span
id="iv.vii.xi-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iv.vii.xi-p8"></span> *Bag.*follows here Valesius’ translation
and note where he makes the word “preservation” a conjectural emendation
of Scaliger, inconsistent with the meaning of the passage, and omits
translating “the cause of all things that exist.” But *Hein.* does not
even hint such reading, and his text (followed also by *Molz.*), so far
from tending to disturb the whole meaning, gives much the more
intelligent conception. Christ is the preserver (saviour) of things.
Preservation of things is the effect of that cause, just as the Father
is the cause of the Son, and the Son the effect of that cause. Therefore
the preserver precedes created things as a cause precedes its effect.

<span id="fn_3420"></span>[569:3421](2010673.htm#fr_3420.md) <span
id="iv.vii.xi-p8.1"></span>

<span id="iv.vii.xi-p9"></span> Valesius expresses a preference for the
reading <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.vii.xi-p9.1"></span>καθόδου</span> (advent) here instead of <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.vii.xi-p9.2"></span>καθόλου</span>
(universal), but the latter is the reading of Heinichen, and undoubtedly
correct. *Bag.* has followed Valesius.

<span id="fn_3421"></span>[569:3422](2010673.htm#fr_3421.md) <span
id="iv.vii.xi-p9.3"></span>

<span id="iv.vii.xi-p10"></span> “New mode” is a paraphrase supported by
only one <span class="c13"><span id="iv.vii.xi-p10.1"></span>ms.</span>
The real meaning of <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.vii.xi-p10.2"></span>νόθην</span> is well expressed by *Chr.,*
“alienam quandam a communi hominum natura nascendi rationem sibi
excogitavit.” Its usual meaning is “illegitimate.”

<span id="fn_3422"></span>[569:3423](2010673.htm#fr_3422.md) <span
id="iv.vii.xi-p10.3"></span>

<span id="iv.vii.xi-p11"></span> This is supposed to refer to [Heb. i.
3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003.md)<span id="iv.vii.xi-p11.1"></span>,
although a different Greek word is used.

<span id="fn_3423"></span>[569:3424](2010673.htm#fr_3423.md) <span
id="iv.vii.xi-p11.2"></span>

<span id="iv.vii.xi-p12"></span> Various suggestions have been made
regarding the dove which according to the literal rendering “flew from
the ark of Noah.” Christophorson (according to Valesius) supposes it to
be that dove which Noah formerly sent out of the ark, this dove being a
figure of the Holy Spirit which was afterward to come in the Virgin.
Jerome, *Ep. ad Oc.,* also regards the Noachic dove as a symbol of the
Holy Spirit. Vales., followed by *1711* and *Bag.,* prefer to translate
as if it were “like that,” &c. This form of the story, according to
which the Holy Spirit descends in the form of a dove, is according to
Valesius from the Apocrypha; perhaps, he suggests, from the “Gospel to
the Hebrews.” In later art the dove is the constant symbol of the Holy
Spirit, and is often found in pictures of the annunciation, e.g. in
pictures by Simeone Memmi, Dürer, Andrea del Sarto, and many others. It
is found in six of the pictures of the annunciation given by Mrs.
Jameson (*Legends of the Madonna,* p. 165 sq.).

<span id="fn_3424"></span>[569:3425](2010673.htm#fr_3424.md) <span
id="iv.vii.xi-p12.1"></span>

<span id="iv.vii.xi-p13"></span> The author seems to have here a
reference to the Aristotelian distinction between prudence and wisdom
(cf. *Ethics,* 6. 3; 7. 8, &c.). It reminds of that passage (vi. 7, ed.
Grant ad. ii. 165–166), where the two are distinguished and defined,
wisdom being “concerned with the immutable, and prudence with the
variable”; and a little farther along wisdom is distinguished from
“statesmanship,” i.e. the “social” of *Bag.,* which is a form of
“prudence” (tr. Williams, p. 160), and indeed (vi. 8. 1) generically
identical with prudence. So again (1, 2) “political art” is identified
with ethics.

<span id="fn_3425"></span>[569:3426](2010673.htm#fr_3425.md) <span
id="iv.vii.xi-p13.1"></span>

<span id="iv.vii.xi-p14"></span> Social virtues or “political” virtues.
Cf. the “political art” or “statesmanship” of Aristotle.

<span id="fn_3426"></span>[569:3427](2010673.htm#fr_3426.md) <span
id="iv.vii.xi-p14.1"></span>

<span id="iv.vii.xi-p15"></span> \[<span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.vii.xi-p15.1"></span>Πολλοῦ χρόνου</span>, “for a considerable
time.” This seems to be a rhetorical addition to the circumstances of
the miracle, scarcely to be justified by the terms of the inspired
narrative.—*Bag.*\]

<span id="fn_3427"></span>[569:3428](2010673.htm#fr_3427.md) <span
id="iv.vii.xi-p15.2"></span>

<span id="iv.vii.xi-p16"></span> At this point Christophorson begins his
chapter xii., “of those who did not know the mystery,” &c.

<span id="fn_3428"></span>[569:3429](2010673.htm#fr_3428.md) <span
id="iv.vii.xi-p16.1"></span>

<span id="iv.vii.xi-p17"></span> The translator takes most extraordinary
liberties with the word “philanthropy”; now it is “loving-kindness,” now
“love of their fellow-men,” and so on in picturesque variety, and yet as
appropriate as it is lacking in uniformity.

<span id="fn_3429"></span>[570:3430](2010673.htm#fr_3429.md) <span
id="iv.vii.xi-p17.1"></span>

<span id="iv.vii.xi-p18"></span> Cf. [Rom.
8:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#025.md), [Gal.
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#005.md)<span id="iv.vii.xi-p18.1"></span>.

<span id="fn_3430"></span>[570:3431](2010673.htm#fr_3430.md) <span
id="iv.vii.xi-p18.2"></span>

<span id="iv.vii.xi-p19"></span> \[The text, in the last clause of this
passage, is undoubtedly corrupt. The above is an attempt to supply a
probable sense.—*Bag.*\] This is omitted by *Hein.* from his text.

<span id="fn_3431"></span>[570:3432](2010673.htm#fr_3431.md) <span
id="iv.vii.xi-p19.1"></span>

<span id="iv.vii.xi-p20"></span> i.e. healing the paralytics. This
paraphrased passage reads more literally, “bidding those bereft of sense
\[i.e. sensation, feeling\] to feel again.” Still it may be that *Molz.*
is right in thinking it refers to the senses—seeing, hearing, &c.—as
well as feeling, though his translation will hardly stand; “and to such
as lacked any of the senses he granted the full use of all their senses
again.”
