<span id="iv.vi.iv.xl-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.xl-p1.1"></span>Chapter XL</span>.—*That having conferred
the Dignity of Cæsars on his Three Sons at the Three Decennial Periods
of his Reign, he dedicated the Church at Jerusalem.*

<span id="iv.vi.iv.xl-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.xl-p2.1"></span>By</span> this time the thirtieth year of
his reign was completed. In the course of this period, his three sons
had been admitted at different times as his colleagues in the empire.
The first, Constantinus, who bore his father’s name, obtained this
distinction about the tenth year of his reign. Constantius, the second
son, so called from his grandfather, was proclaimed Cæsar about the
twentieth, while Constans, the third, whose name expresses the firmness
and stability of his character, was advanced to the same dignity at the
thirtieth anniversary of his father’s reign. <span
id="fr_3336"></span>[3337](#fn_3336) Having thus reared a threefold
offspring, a Trinity, <span id="fr_3337"></span>[3338](#fn_3337) as it
were, of pious sons, and having received them severally at each
decennial period to a participation in his imperial authority, he judged
the festival of his Tricennalia to be a fit occasion for thanksgiving to
the Sovereign Lord of all, at the same time believing that the
dedication of the church which his zealous magnificence had erected at
Jerusalem might advantageously be performed.

<span id="iv.vi.iv.xl-p3"></span> These are general dates; “about” the
tenth, etc., would have been more exact. Compare Prolegomena, under
*Life.*

English Translator remark on this, “An odd expression.” We may go
further, and denounce it as an instance of the senseless and profane
adulation to which our author, perhaps in the spirit of his age, seems
to have been but too much inclined.—*Bag*.\]
