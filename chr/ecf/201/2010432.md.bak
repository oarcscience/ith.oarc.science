<span id="iv.vi.i.xlvii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.xlvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLVII</span>.—*Death of
Maximin,* <span id="fr_3146"></span>[3147](#fn_3146.md) *who had attempted
a Conspiracy, and of Others whom Constantine detected by Divine
Revelation.*

<span id="iv.vi.i.xlvii-p3"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.xlvii-p3.1"></span>While</span> he was thus engaged, the
second of those who had resigned the throne, being detected in a
treasonable conspiracy, suffered a most ignominious death. He was the
first whose pictures, statues, and all similar marks of honor and
distinction were everywhere destroyed, on the ground of his crimes and
impiety. After him others also of the same family were discovered in the
act of forming secret plots against the emperor; all their intentions
being miraculously revealed by God through visions to His servant.

<span id="iv.vi.i.xlvii-p4"></span>For he frequently vouchsafed to him
manifestations of himself, the Divine presence appearing to him in a
most marvelous manner, and according to him manifold intimations of
future events. Indeed, it is impossible to express in words the
indescribable wonders of Divine grace which God was pleased to vouchsafe
to His servant. Surrounded by these, he passed the rest of his life in
security, rejoicing in the affection of his subjects, rejoicing too
because he saw all beneath his government leading contented lives; but
above all delighted at the flourishing condition of the churches of God.

<span id="iv.vi.i.xlvii-p2"></span> There is long discussion of whether
Maximian or Maximin is intended. To any one who compares the order of
narration in the *Church History,* 9. 9, 11, the discussion will seem
idle, though it is curious that the one most jealous and greedy of power
should have been mistaken for one of the abdicators. It seems as if
there had been some confusion in the mind of Eusebius himself.
