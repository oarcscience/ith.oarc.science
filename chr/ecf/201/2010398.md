<span id="iv.vi.i.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIII</span>.—*Of Constantius his
Father, who refused to imitate Diocletian, Maximian, and
Maxentius,* <span id="fr_3077"></span>[3078](#fn_3077.md) *in their
Persecution of the Christians.*

<span id="iv.vi.i.xiii-p3"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.xiii-p3.1"></span>At</span> a time when four emperors <span
id="fr_3078"></span>[3079](#fn_3078.md) shared the administration of the
Roman empire, Constantius alone, following a course of conduct different
from that pursued by his colleagues, entered into the friendship of the
Supreme God.

<span id="iv.vi.i.xiii-p5"></span>For while they besieged and wasted the
churches of God, leveling them to the ground, and obliterating the very
foundations of the houses of prayer, <span
id="fr_3079"></span>[3080](#fn_3079.md) he kept his hands pure from their
abominable impiety, and never in any respect resembled them. They
polluted their provinces by the indiscriminate slaughter of godly men
and women; but he kept his soul free from the stain of this crime. <span
id="fr_3080"></span>[3081](#fn_3080.md) They, involved in the mazes of
impious idolatry, enthralled first themselves, and then all under their
authority, in bondage to the errors of evil demons, while he at the same
time originated the profoundest peace throughout his dominions, and
secured to his subjects the privilege of celebrating without hindrance
the worship of God. In short, while his colleagues oppressed all men by
the most grievous exactions, and rendered their lives intolerable, and
even worse than death, Constantius alone governed his people with a mild
and tranquil sway, and exhibited towards them a truly parental and
fostering care. Numberless, indeed, are the other virtues of this man,
which are the theme of praise to all; of these I will record one or two
instances, as specimens of the quality of those which I must pass by in
silence, and then I will proceed to the appointed order of my narrative.
