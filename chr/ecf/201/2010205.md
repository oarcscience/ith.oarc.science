<span id="iii.xi.xxxv-p3"></span> On Heraclas, see chap. 3, note 2. The
third year of Philip’s reign extended from the summer of 246 to the
summer of 247, so that if Heraclas became bishop in 232, he cannot have
held office fully sixteen years. The agreement, however, is so close as
to occasion no difficulty.
