<span id="iv.vi.iii.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XV</span>.—*How Constantine
entertained the Bishops on the Occasion of His Vicennalia.*

<span id="iv.vi.iii.xv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.xv-p2.1"></span>About</span> this time he completed the
twentieth year of his reign. <span id="fr_3250"></span>[3251](#fn_3250)
On this occasion public festivals were celebrated by the people of the
provinces generally, but the emperor himself invited and feasted with
those ministers of God <span id="page_524">p. 524</span> <span
id="iv.vi.iii.xv-Page_524"></span>whom he had reconciled, and thus
offered as it were through them a suitable sacrifice to God. Not one of
the bishops was wanting at the imperial banquet, <span
id="fr_3251"></span>[3252](#fn_3251) the circumstances of which were
splendid beyond description. Detachments of the body-guard and other
troops surrounded the entrance of the palace with drawn swords, and
through the midst of these the men of God proceeded without fear into
the innermost of the imperial apartments, in which some were the
emperor’s own companions at table, while others reclined on couches
arranged on either side. <span id="fr_3252"></span>[3253](#fn_3252) One
might have thought that a picture of Christ’s kingdom was thus shadowed
forth, and a dream rather than reality.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.xv-p4"></span> At the risk of seeming trivial in
sober and professedly condensed annotation, one cannot help noting that
the human nature of ancient and modern councils is the same,—much
controversy and more or less absenteeism, but all present at dinner.
