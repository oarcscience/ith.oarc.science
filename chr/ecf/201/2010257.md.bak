<span id="iii.xiii.vi-p3"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span

the decree against the churches in Nicomedia, <span
id="fr_2515"></span>[2516](#fn_2515.md) a certain man, not obscure but very
highly honored with distinguished temporal dignities, moved with zeal
toward God, and incited with ardent faith, seized the edict as it was
posted openly and publicly, and tore it to pieces as a profane and
impious thing; <span id="fr_2516"></span>[2517](#fn_2516.md) and this was
done <span id="page_327">p. 327</span> <span
id="iii.xiii.vi-Page_327"></span>while two of the sovereigns were in the
same city,—the oldest of all, and the one who held the fourth place in
the government after him. <span id="fr_2517"></span>[2518](#fn_2517.md)

<span id="iii.xiii.vi-p7"></span>2. But this man, first in that place,
after distinguishing himself in such a manner suffered those things
which were likely to follow such daring, and kept his spirit cheerful
and undisturbed till death.

<span id="iii.xiii.vi-p2"></span> Nicomedia, the capital city of
Bithynia, became Diocletian’s chief place of residence, and was made by
him the Eastern capital of the empire.

<span id="fn_2515"></span>[326:2516](2010257.htm#fr_2515.md) <span
id="iii.xiii.vi-p3.2"></span>

<span id="iii.xiii.vi-p4"></span> The great church of Nicomedia was
destroyed on Feb. 23, 303, and the First Edict was published on the
following day (see above, chap. 2, note 3).

<span id="fn_2516"></span>[326:2517](2010257.htm#fr_2516.md) <span
id="iii.xiii.vi-p4.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xiii.vi-p5"></span> Lactantius relates this account in his
*De mort. pers.* chap. 13, and expresses disapproval of the act, while
admiring the spirit of the man. He, too, is silent in regard to the name
of the man, though, living as he did in Nicomedia, he can hardly have
been ignorant of it. We may perhaps imagine that he did not care to
perpetuate the name of a man whom he considered to have acted rashly and
illegally. The old martyrologies give the man’s name as John. That he
deserved death is clear enough. He was not a martyr to the faith, but a
criminal, who was justly executed for treasonable conduct. The first
edict contemplated no violence to the persons of the Christians. If they
suffered death, it was solely in consequence of their own rashness, as
in the present case. It is clear that such an incident as this would
anger Diocletian and increase his suspicions of Christians as a class,
and thus tend to precipitate a regular persecution. It must have seemed
to the authorities that the man would hardly commit such a foolhardy act
unless he was conscious of the support of a large body of the populace,
and so the belief in the wide extension of the plot which had caused the
movement on the part of the emperors must have been confirmed. See
below, p. 398 sq.
