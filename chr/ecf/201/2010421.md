id="iv.vi.i.xxxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXVI</span>.—*Magic Arts of
Maxentius against Constantine; and Famine at Rome.*

<span id="iv.vi.i.xxxvi-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.xxxvi-p2.1"></span>But</span> the crowning point of the
tyrant’s wickedness was his having recourse to sorcery: sometimes for
magic purposes ripping up women with child, at other times searching
into the bowels of new-born infants. He slew lions also, and practiced
certain horrid arts for evoking demons, and averting the approaching
war, hoping by these means to get the victory. In short, it is
impossible to describe the manifold acts of oppression by which this
tyrant of Rome enslaved his subjects: so that by this time they were
reduced to the most extreme penury and want of necessary food, a
scarcity such as our contemporaries do not remember ever before to have
existed at Rome. <span id="fr_3121"></span>[3122](#fn_3121)

else,” but *Bag.* is undoubtedly right in translating simply “ever
before.” The chapter is found substantially and in part word for word in
the *Church History,* 8. 14.
