id="iv.vi.iv.lxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter LXIII</span>.—*How after his
Baptism he rendered Thanks to God.*

<span id="iv.vi.iv.lxiii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.lxiii-p2.1"></span>He</span> then lifted his voice and
poured forth a strain of thanksgiving to God; after which he added these
words. “Now I know that I am truly blessed: now I feel assured that I am
accounted worthy of immortality, and am made a partaker of Divine
light.” He further expressed his compassion for the unhappy condition of
those who were strangers to such blessings as he enjoyed: and when the
tribunes and generals of his army appeared in his presence with
lamentations and tears at the prospect of their bereavement, and with
prayers that his days might yet be prolonged, he assured them in reply
that he was now in possession of true life; that none but himself could
know the value of the blessings he had received; so that he was anxious
rather to hasten than to defer his departure to God. He then proceeded
to complete the needful arrangement of his affairs, bequeathing an
annual donation to the Roman inhabitants of his imperial city;
apportioning the inheritance of the empire, like a patrimonial estate,
among his own children; in short, making every disposition according to
his own pleasure. <span id="fr_3360"></span>[3361](#fn_3360.md)

<span id="iv.vi.iv.lxiii-p3"></span> The idea of ownership in empire
which seems so strange in these days of republics, and is disallowed
even by theoretical monarchists, seems to have been a most
matter-of-course one in the mind of Constantine, and Eusebius was a true
imperialist regarding “tyranies” and “republics” as in the same
category. Whether it was by “divine right” or “natural right” they were
quite sure it was a “right,” and one to be freely exercised.
