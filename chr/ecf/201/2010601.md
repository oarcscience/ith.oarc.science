<span id="iv.vi.iv.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XV</span>.—*He causes himself to be
represented on his Coins, and in his Portraits, in the Attitude of
Prayer.*

<span id="iv.vi.iv.xv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.xv-p2.1"></span>How</span> deeply his soul was impressed by
the power of divine faith may be understood from the circumstance that
he directed his likeness to be stamped on the golden coin of the empire
with the eyes uplifted as in the posture of prayer to God: and this
money became current throughout the Roman world. His portrait also at
full length was placed over the entrance gates of the palaces in some
cities, the eyes upraised to heaven, and the hands outspread as if in
prayer.
