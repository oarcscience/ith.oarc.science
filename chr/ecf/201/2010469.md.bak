Augustus</span>, to the inhabitants of the province of Palestine.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xxiv-p4"></span>“To all who entertain just and sound
sentiments respecting the character of the Supreme Being, it has long
been most clearly evident, and beyond the possibility of doubt, how vast
a difference there has ever been between those who maintain a careful
observance of the hallowed duties of the Christian religion, and those
who treat this religion with hostility or contempt. But at this present
time, we may see by still more manifest proofs, and still more decisive
instances, both how unreasonable it were to question this truth, and how
mighty is the power of the Supreme God: since it appears that they who
faithfully observe His holy laws, and shrink from the transgression of
His commandments, are rewarded with abundant blessings, and are endued
with well-grounded hope as well as ample power for the accomplishment of
their undertakings. On the other hand, they who have cherished impious
sentiments have experienced results corresponding to their evil choice.
For how is it to be expected that any blessing would be obtained by one
who neither desired to acknowledge nor duly to worship that God who is
the source of all blessing? Indeed, facts themselves are a confirmation
of what I say.
