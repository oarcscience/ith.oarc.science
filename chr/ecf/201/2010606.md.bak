<span id="iv.vi.iv.xx-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.xx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XX</span>.—*The Form of Prayer
given by Constantine to his Soldiers.*

<span id="iv.vi.iv.xx-p2"></span>“<span class="c13"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.xx-p2.1"></span>We</span> acknowledge thee the only God: we
own thee, as our King and implore thy succor. By thy favor have we
gotten the victory: through thee are we mightier than our enemies. We
render thanks for thy past benefits, and trust thee for future
blessings. Together we pray to thee, and beseech thee long to preserve
to us, safe and triumphant, our emperor Constantine and his pious sons.”
Such was the duty to be performed on Sunday by his troops, and such the
prayer they were instructed to offer up to God.
