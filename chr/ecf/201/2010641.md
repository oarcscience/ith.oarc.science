<span id="iv.vi.iv.lv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.lv-p1.1"></span>Chapter LV</span>.—*Constantine employed
himself in Composition of Various Kinds to the Close of his Life.*

<span id="iv.vi.iv.lv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span

over-taken by divine chastisement. To return to our emperor. He had so
thoroughly trained his mind in the art of reasoning that he continued to
the last to compose discourses on various subjects, to deliver frequent
orations in public, and to instruct his hearers in the sacred doctrines
of religion. He was also habitually engaged in legislating both on
political and military questions; <span
id="fr_3354"></span>[3355](#fn_3354.md) in short, in devising whatever
might be conducive to the general welfare of the human race. It is well
worthy of remark, that, very shortly before his departure, he pronounced
a funeral oration before his usual auditory, in which he spoke at length
on the immortality of the soul, the state of those who had persevered in
a life of godliness, and the blessings which God has laid up in store
for them that love him. On the other hand he made it appear by copious
and conclusive arguments what the end of those will be who have pursued
a contrary career, describing in vivid language the final ruin of the
ungodly. His powerful testimony on these subjects seemed so far to touch
the consciences of those around him, that one of the self-imagined
philosophers, of whom he asked his opinion of what he had heard, bore
testimony to the truth of his words, and accorded a real, though
reluctant, tribute of praise to the arguments by which he had exposed
the worship of a plurality of gods. By converse such as this with his
friends before his death, the emperor seemed as it were to smooth and
prepare the way for his transition to a happier life.
