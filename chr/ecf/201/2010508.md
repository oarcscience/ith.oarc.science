id="iv.vi.ii.lxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter LXIII</span>.—*How Constantine
sent a Messenger and a Letter concerning Peace.*

<span id="iv.vi.ii.lxiii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.lxiii-p2.1"></span>As</span> soon as the emperor was
informed of these facts, which he heard with much sorrow of heart,
considering them in the light of a calamity personally affecting
himself, he forthwith selected from the Christians in his train one whom
he well knew to be approved for the sobriety and genuineness of his
faith, <span id="fr_3210"></span>[3211](#fn_3210.md) and who had before
this time distinguished himself by the boldness of his religious
profession, and sent him to negotiate peace <span
id="fr_3211"></span>[3212](#fn_3211.md) between the dissentient parties at
Alexandria. He also made him the bearer of a most needful and
appropriate letter to the original movers of the strife: and this
letter, as exhibiting a specimen of his watchful care over God’s people,
it may be well to introduce into this our narrative of his life. Its
purport was as follows.
