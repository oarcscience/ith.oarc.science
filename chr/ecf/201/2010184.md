<span id="iii.xi.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xi.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIV.—</span>*The Scriptures
mentioned by Him.*

<span id="iii.xi.xiv-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xi.xiv-p2.1"></span>To</span> sum up briefly, he has given in
the Hypotyposes <span id="fr_1868"></span>[1869](#fn_1868.md) abridged
accounts of all canonical Scripture, not omitting the disputed
books, <span id="fr_1869"></span>[1870](#fn_1869.md) —I refer to Jude and
the other Catholic epistles, and Barnabas <span
id="fr_1870"></span>[1871](#fn_1870.md) and the so-called Apocalypse of
Peter. <span id="fr_1871"></span>[1872](#fn_1871.md)

<span id="iii.xi.xiv-p7"></span>2. He says that the Epistle to the
Hebrews <span id="fr_1872"></span>[1873](#fn_1872.md) is the work of Paul,
and that it was written to the Hebrews in the Hebrew language; but that
Luke translated it carefully and published it for the Greeks, and hence
the same style of expression is found in this epistle and in the Acts.

<span id="iii.xi.xiv-p9"></span>3. But he says that the words, Paul the
Apostle, were probably not prefixed, because, in sending it to the
Hebrews, who were prejudiced and suspicious of him, he wisely did not
wish to repel them at the very beginning by giving his name.

<span id="iii.xi.xiv-p10"></span>4. Farther on he says: “But now, as the
blessed presbyter said, since the Lord being the apostle of the
Almighty, was sent to the Hebrews, Paul, as sent to the Gentiles, on
account of his modesty did not subscribe himself an apostle of the
Hebrews, through respect for the Lord, and because being a herald and
apostle of the Gentiles he wrote to the Hebrews out of his
superabundance.”

<span id="iii.xi.xiv-p11"></span>5. Again, in the same books, Clement
gives the tradition of the earliest presbyters, as to the order of the
Gospels, in the following manner:

<span id="iii.xi.xiv-p12"></span>6. The Gospels containing the
genealogies, he says, were written first. The Gospel according to
Mark <span id="fr_1873"></span>[1874](#fn_1873.md) had this occasion. As
Peter had preached the Word publicly at Rome, and declared the Gospel by
the Spirit, many who were present requested that Mark, who had followed
him for a long time and remembered his sayings, should write them out.
And having composed the Gospel he gave it to those who had requested it.

<span id="iii.xi.xiv-p14"></span>7. When Peter learned of this, he
neither directly forbade nor encouraged it. But, last of all, John,
perceiving that the external <span id="fr_1874"></span>[1875](#fn_1874.md)
facts had been made plain in the Gospel, being urged by his friends, and
inspired by the Spirit, composed a spiritual Gospel.” <span
id="fr_1875"></span>[1876](#fn_1875.md) This is the account of Clement.

<span id="iii.xi.xiv-p17"></span>8. Again the above-mentioned
Alexander, <span id="fr_1876"></span>[1877](#fn_1876.md) in a certain
letter to Origen, refers to Clement, and at the same time to Pantænus,
as being among his familiar acquaintances. He writes as follows:

<span id="iii.xi.xiv-p19"></span>“For this, as thou knowest, was the
will of God, that the ancestral friendship existing between us should
remain unshaken; nay, rather should be warmer and stronger.

<span id="iii.xi.xiv-p20"></span>9. For we know well those blessed
fathers who have trodden the way before us, with whom we shall soon
be; <span id="fr_1877"></span>[1878](#fn_1877.md) Pantænus, the truly
blessed man and master, and the holy Clement, my master and benefactor,
and if there is any other like them, through whom I became acquainted
with thee, the best in everything, my master and brother.” <span
id="fr_1878"></span>[1879](#fn_1878.md)

<span id="iii.xi.xiv-p23"></span>10. So much for these matters. But
Adamantius, <span id="fr_1879"></span>[1880](#fn_1879.md) —for this also
was a name of Origen,—when Zephyrinus <span
id="fr_1880"></span>[1881](#fn_1880.md) was bishop of Rome, visited <span
id="page_262">p. 262</span> <span id="iii.xi.xiv-Page_262"></span>Rome,
“desiring,” as he himself somewhere says, “to see the most ancient
church of Rome.”

<span id="iii.xi.xiv-p26"></span>11. After a short stay there he
returned to Alexandria. And he performed the duties of catechetical
instruction there with great zeal; Demetrius, who was bishop there at
that time, urging and even entreating him to work diligently for the
benefit of the brethren. <span id="fr_1881"></span>[1882](#fn_1881.md)

<span id="fn_1877"></span>[261:1878](2010184.htm#fr_1877.md) <span
id="iii.xi.xiv-p20.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xi.xiv-p21"></span> We see from this sentence that at the
time of the writing of this epistle both Pantænus and Clement were dead.
The latter was still alive when Alexander wrote to the Antiochenes (see
chap. 11), i.e. about the year 211 (see note 5 on that chapter). How
much longer he lived we cannot tell. The epistle referred to here must
of course have been written at any rate subsequent to the year 211, and
hence while Alexander was bishop of Jerusalem. The expression “with whom
we shall soon be” (<span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xi.xiv-p21.1"></span>πρὸς οὕς μετ᾽ ὀλίγον ἐσόμεθα</span>) seems
to imply that the epistle was written when Alexander and Origen were
advanced in life, but this cannot be pressed.

<span id="fn_1878"></span>[261:1879](2010184.htm#fr_1878.md) <span
id="iii.xi.xiv-p21.2"></span>

<span id="iii.xi.xiv-p22"></span> It is from this passage that we gather
that Alexander was a student of Clement’s and a fellow-pupil of Origen’s
(see chap. 8, note 6, and chap. 2, note 1). The epistle does not state
this directly, but the conclusion seems sufficiently obvious.

<span id="fn_1879"></span>[261:1880](2010184.htm#fr_1879.md) <span
id="iii.xi.xiv-p23.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xi.xiv-p24"></span> The name Adamantius (<span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.xi.xiv-p24.1"></span>᾽</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.xi.xiv-p24.2"></span>Αδαμ€ντιος</span> from
<span class="Greek"><span id="iii.xi.xiv-p24.3"></span>ἀ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.xi.xiv-p24.4"></span>δ€μας</span>
*unconquerable,*hence *hard, adamantine*) is said by Jerome (*Ep. ad
Paulam,* §3; Migne’s ed. *Ep.* XXXIII.) to have been given him on
account of his untiring industry, by Photius (*Cod.* 118) on account of
the invincible force of his arguments, and by Epiphanius (*Hær.* LXIV.
74) to have been vainly adopted by himself. But Eusebius’ simple
statement at this point looks rather as if *Adamantius* was a second
name which belonged to Origen from the beginning, and had no reference
to his character. We know that two names were very common in that age.
This opinion is adopted by Tillemont, Redepenning, Westcott, and others,
although many still hold the opposite view. Another name,
*Chalcenterus,* given to him by Jerome in the epistle already referred
to, was undoubtedly, as we can see from the context, applied to him by
Jerome, because of his resemblance to Didymus of Alexandria (who bore
that surname) in his immense industry as an author.

<span id="fn_1880"></span>[261:1881](2010184.htm#fr_1880.md) <span
id="iii.xi.xiv-p24.5"></span>

<span id="iii.xi.xiv-p25"></span> On Zephyrinus, bishop of Rome, see Bk.
V. chap. 28, note 5. He was bishop from about 198, or 199, to 217. This
gives considerable range for the date of Origen’s visit to Rome, which
we have no means of fixing with exactness. There is no reason for
supposing that Eusebius is incorrect in putting it among the events
occurring during Caracalla’s reign (211–217). On the other hand, it must
have taken place before the year 216, for in that year Origen went to
Palestine (see chap. 19, note 23) and remained there some time. Whether
Origen’s visit was undertaken simply from the desire to see the church
of Rome, as Eusebius says, or in connection with matters of business, we
cannot tell.
