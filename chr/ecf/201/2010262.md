<span id="iii.xiii.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xiii.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter X</span>.—*The Writings of Phileas
the Martyr describing the Occurrences at Alexandria.*

<span id="iii.xiii.xi-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xiii.xi-p2.1"></span>Since</span> we have mentioned Phileas as
having a high reputation for secular learning, let him be his own
witness in the following extract, in which he shows us who he was, and
at the same time describes more accurately than we can the martyrdoms
which occurred in his time at Alexandria: <span
id="fr_2538"></span>[2539](#fn_2538)

<span id="iii.xiii.xi-p4"></span>2. “Having before them all these
examples and models and noble tokens which are given us in the Divine
and Sacred Scriptures, the blessed martyrs who were with us did not
hesitate, but directing the eye of the soul in sincerity toward the God
over all, and having their mind set upon death for religion, they
adhered firmly to their calling. For they understood that our Lord Jesus
Christ had become man on our account, that he might cut off all sin and
furnish us with the means of entrance into eter<span id="page_331">p.
331</span> <span id="iii.xiii.xi-Page_331"></span>nal life. For ‘he
counted it not a prize to be on an equality with God, but emptied
himself taking the form of a servant; and being found in fashion as a
man, he humbled himself unto death, even the death of the cross.’ <span
id="fr_2539"></span>[2540](#fn_2539)

<span id="iii.xiii.xi-p6"></span>3. Wherefore also being zealous for the
greater gifts, the Christ-bearing martyrs endured all trials and all
kinds of contrivances for torture; not once only, but some also a second
time. And although the guards vied with each other in threatening them
in all sorts of ways, not in words only, but in actions, they did not
give up their resolution; because ‘perfect love casteth out fear.’ <span
id="fr_2540"></span>[2541](#fn_2540)

<span id="iii.xiii.xi-p8"></span>4. “What words could describe their
courage and manliness under every torture? For as liberty to abuse them
was given to all that wished, some beat them with clubs, others with
rods, others with scourges, yet others with thongs, and others with
ropes.

<span id="iii.xiii.xi-p9"></span>5. And the spectacle of the outrages
was varied and exhibited great malignity. For some, with their hands
bound behind them, were suspended on the stocks, and every member
stretched by certain machines. Then the torturers, as commanded,
lacerated with instruments <span id="fr_2541"></span>[2542](#fn_2541)
their entire bodies; not only their sides, as in the case of murderers,
but also their stomachs and knees and cheeks. Others were raised aloft,
suspended from the porch by one hand, and endured the most terrible
suffering of all, through the distension of their joints and limbs.
Others were bound face to face to pillars, not resting on their feet,
but with the weight of their bodies bearing on their bonds and drawing
them tightly.

<span id="iii.xiii.xi-p11"></span>6. And they endured this, not merely
as long as the governor talked with them or was at leisure, but through
almost the entire day. For when he passed on to others, he left officers
under his authority to watch the first, and observe if any of them,
overcome by the tortures, appeared to yield. And he commanded to cast
them into chains without mercy, and afterwards when they were at the
last gasp to throw them to the ground and drag them away.

<span id="iii.xiii.xi-p12"></span>7. For he said that they were not to
have the least concern for us, but were to think and act as if we no
longer existed, our enemies having invented this second mode of torture
in addition to the stripes.

<span id="iii.xiii.xi-p13"></span>8. “Some, also, after these outrages,
were placed on the stocks, and had both their feet stretched over the
four <span id="fr_2542"></span>[2543](#fn_2542) holes, so that they were
compelled to lie on their backs on the stocks, being unable to keep
themselves up on account of the fresh wounds with which their entire
bodies were covered as a result of the scourging. Others were thrown on
the ground and lay there under the accumulated infliction of tortures,
exhibiting to the spectators a more terrible manifestation of severity,
as they bore on their bodies the marks of the various and diverse
punishments which had been invented.

<span id="iii.xiii.xi-p15"></span>9. As this went on, some died under
the tortures, shaming the adversary by their constancy. Others half dead
were shut up in prison, and suffering with their agonies, they died in a
few days; but the rest, recovering under the care which they received,
gained confidence by time and their long detention in prison.

<span id="iii.xiii.xi-p16"></span>10. When therefore they were ordered
to choose whether they would be released from molestation by touching
the polluted sacrifice, and would receive from them the accursed
freedom, or refusing to sacrifice, should be condemned to death, they
did not hesitate, but went to death cheerfully. For they knew what had
been declared before by the Sacred Scriptures. For it is said, <span
id="fr_2543"></span>[2544](#fn_2543) ‘He that sacrificeth to other gods
shall be utterly destroyed,’ <span id="fr_2544"></span>[2545](#fn_2544)
and, ‘Thou shalt have no other gods before me.’” <span
id="fr_2545"></span>[2546](#fn_2545)

<span id="iii.xiii.xi-p20"></span>11. Such are the words of the truly
philosophical and God-loving martyr, which, before the final sentence,
while yet in prison, he addressed to the brethren in his parish, showing
them his own circumstances, and at the same time exhorting them to hold
fast, even after his approaching death, to the religion of Christ.

<span id="iii.xiii.xi-p21"></span>12. But why need we dwell upon these
things, and continue to add fresh instances of the conflicts of the
divine martyrs throughout the world, especially since they were dealt
with no longer by common law, but attacked like enemies of war?

literally a weapon of defense, but the word seems to indicate in the
present case some kind of a sharp instrument with claws or hooks.
Rufinus translates *ungulæ,* the technical term for an instrument of
torture of the kind just described. Valesius remarks, however, that
these <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xiii.xi-p10.4"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xiii.xi-p10.5"></span>μυντήρια</span> seem to have been
something more than *ungulæ,* for Hesychius interprets <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.xiii.xi-p10.6"></span>ἀ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.xiii.xi-p10.7"></span>μυντήριον</span> as
<span class="Greek"><span id="iii.xiii.xi-p10.8"></span>ξίφος

<span id="iii.xiii.xi-p14"></span> The majority of the <span

Laemmer and Heinichen, omit <span class="Greek"><span

however, is found in a few good <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xiii.xi-p14.3"></span>mss.</span>, and is adopted by all the
other editors and translators, and seems necessary in the present case.
Upon the instrument referred to here, see above, Bk. IV. chap. 16, note
9. It would seem that “four holes” constituted in ordinary cases the
extreme limit. But in two cases (Bk. V. chap. 1, §27, and *Mart. Pal.*
chap. 2) we are told of a “fifth hole.” It is possible that the
instruments varied in respect to the number of the holes, for the way in
which the “four” is used here and elsewhere seems to indicate that the
extreme of torture is thought of.
