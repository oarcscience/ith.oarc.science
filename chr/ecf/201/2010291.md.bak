<span id="iii.xv.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xv.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI.—</span>*Those who suffered
Martyrdom at this Time.*

<span id="iii.xv.vi-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xv.vi-p2.1"></span>Not</span> long afterward, however, this
military commander became his own murderer and paid the penalty for his
wickedness. But we were obliged again to endure exile and severe
persecutions, and the governors in every province were once more
terribly stirred up against us; so that even some of those illustrious
in the Divine Word were seized and had sentence of death pronounced upon
them without mercy. Three of them in the city of Emesa <span
id="fr_2733"></span>[2734](#fn_2733.md) in Phœnicia, having confessed that
they were Christians, were thrown as food to the wild beasts. Among them
was a bishop Silvanus, <span id="fr_2734"></span>[2735](#fn_2734.md) a very
old man, who had filled his office full forty years.

<span id="iii.xv.vi-p5"></span>2. At about the same time Peter <span
id="fr_2735"></span>[2736](#fn_2735.md) also, who presided most
illustriously over the parishes in Alexandria, a divine example of a
bishop on account of the excellence of his life and his study of the
sacred Scriptures, being seized for no cause and quite unexpectedly,
was, as if by command of Maximinus, immediately and without explanation,
beheaded. With him also many other bishops of Egypt suffered the same
fate.

<span id="iii.xv.vi-p7"></span>3. And Lucian, <span
id="fr_2736"></span>[2737](#fn_2736.md) a presbyter of the parish at
Antioch, and a most excellent man in every respect, temperate in life
and famed for his learning in sacred things, was brought to the city of
Nicomedia, where at that time the emperor happened to be staying, and
after delivering before the ruler an apology for the doctrine which he
professed, was committed to prison and put to death.

<span id="iii.xv.vi-p9"></span>4. Such trials were brought upon us in a
brief time by Maximinus, the enemy of virtue, so that this persecution
which was stirred up against us seemed far more cruel than the former.

<span id="iii.xv.vi-p3"></span> Emesa was an important city in Northern
Phœnicia, the birthplace of the Emperor Elagabalus, and chiefly famous
for its great temple of the Sun.

<span id="fn_2734"></span>[360:2735](2010291.htm#fr_2734.md) <span
id="iii.xv.vi-p3.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xv.vi-p4"></span> On Silvanus, bishop of Emesa, see above,
Bk. VIII. chap. 13, note 4.

<span id="fn_2735"></span>[360:2736](2010291.htm#fr_2735.md) <span
id="iii.xv.vi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xv.vi-p6"></span> On Peter, bishop of Alexandria, see
above, Bk. VII. chap. 32, note 54. According to that chapter he suffered
in the ninth year of the persecution; that is, at least as early as
April, 312.

<span id="fn_2736"></span>[360:2737](2010291.htm#fr_2736.md) <span
id="iii.xv.vi-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xv.vi-p8"></span> The presbyter Lucian, who is mentioned
also in Bk. VIII. chap. 13, above, was one of the greatest scholars of
the early Church, and with Dorotheus (see above, Bk. VII. chap. 32, note
9) at the head of the famous theological school at Antioch. He produced
a revised version of the LXX, which enjoyed a wide circulation (see
Jerome’s *de vir. ill.* 77, and Westcott’s *Hist. of the N. T. Canon,*
p. 392 sq.); and also wrote some books on Faith (see Jerome, *ibid.*),
some epistles (see *ibid.,* and Suidas, *s.v.*), and a commentary on
Job, of which a Latin fragment has been preserved and is given by Routh,
*Rel. Sacræ,* IV. p. 7–10. His works have perished, with the exception
of a brief fragment of an epistle, the fragment from his commentary on
Job just referred to, and a part of his defense before Maximinus
(referred to in the present chapter) which is preserved by Rufinus, *H.
E.* IX. 6, and is probably genuine (cf. Westcott, *ibid.* p. 393). These
extant fragments are given, with annotations, by Routh, *ibid*. p. 5 sq.
Lucian’s chief historical significance lies in his relation to Arianism.
On this subject, see above, p. 11 sq.
