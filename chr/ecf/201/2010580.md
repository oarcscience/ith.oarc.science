id="iv.vi.iii.lxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter LXI</span>.—*The Emperor’s Letter
to Eusebius praising him for refusing the Bishopric of Antioch.*

<span id="iv.vi.iii.lxi-p2"></span>The Emperor’s Letter to me on my
refusing the Bishopric of Antioch.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.lxi-p3"></span>“<span class="c13"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.lxi-p3.1"></span>Victor Constantinus, Maximus
Augustus</span>, to Eusebius.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.lxi-p4"></span>“I have most carefully perused your
letter, and perceive that you have strictly conformed to the rule
enjoined by the discipline of the Church. Now to abide by that which
appears at the same time pleasing to God, and accordant with apostolical
tradition, is a proof of true piety. You have reason to deem yourself
happy on this behalf, that you are counted worthy, in the judgment, I
may say, of all the world, to have the oversight of any church. For the
desire which all feel to claim you for their own, undoubtedly enhances
your enviable fortune in this respect. Notwithstanding, your Prudence
whose resolve it is to observe the ordinances of God and the apostolic
canon of the Church, <span id="fr_3299"></span>[3300](#fn_3299) has done
excellently well in declining the bishopric of the church at Antioch,
and desiring to continue in that church of which you first received the
oversight by the will of God. I have written on this subject to the
people of Antioch, and also to your colleagues in the ministry who had
themselves consulted me in regard to this question; on reading which
letters, your Holiness will easily discern, that, inasmuch as justice
itself opposed their claims, I have written to them under divine
direction. It will be necessary that your Prudence should be present at
their conference, in order that this decision may be ratified in the
church at Antioch. God preserve you, beloved brother!”
