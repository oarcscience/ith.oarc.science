id="iv.vi.ii.i-p2.1"></span>Chapter I</span>.—*Secret Persecution by
Licinius, who causes Some Bishops to be put to Death at Amasia of
Pontus.*

<span id="iv.vi.ii.i-p3"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.i-p3.1"></span>In</span> this manner, he of whom we have
spoken continued to rush headlong towards that destruction which awaits
the enemies of God; and once more, with a fatal emulation of their
example whose ruin he had himself witnessed as the consequence of their
impious conduct, he re-kindled the persecution of the Christians, like a
long-extinguished fire, and fanned the unhallowed flame to a fiercer
height than any who had gone before him.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.i-p4"></span>At first, indeed, though breathing fury
and threatenings against God, like some savage beast of prey, or some
crooked and wriggling serpent, he dared not, from fear of Constantine,
openly level his attacks against the churches of God subject to his
dominion; but dissembled the virulence of his malice, and endeavored by
secret and limited measures to compass the death of the bishops, the
most eminent of whom he found means to remove, through charges laid
against them by the governors of the several provinces. And the manner
in which they suffered had in it something strange, and hitherto unheard
of. At all events, the barbarities perpetrated at Amasia of Pontus
surpassed every known excess of cruelty.
