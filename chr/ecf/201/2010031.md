<span id="iii.vi.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.vi.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.—</span>*The Religion Proclaimed
by Him to All Nations Was Neither New Nor Strange.*

<span id="iii.vi.iv-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.vi.iv-p2.1"></span>But</span> that no one may suppose that his
doctrine is new and strange, as if it were framed by a man of recent
origin, differing in no respect from other men, let us now briefly
consider this point also.

<span id="iii.vi.iv-p3"></span>2. It is admitted that when in recent
times the appearance of our Saviour Jesus Christ had become known to all
men there immediately made its appearance a new nation; a nation
confessedly not small, and not dwelling in some corner of the earth, but
the most numerous and pious of all nations, <span
id="fr_65"></span>[66](#fn_65) indestructible and unconquerable, because
it always receives assistance from God. This nation, thus suddenly
appearing at the time appointed by the inscrutable counsel of God, is
the one which has been honored by all with the name of Christ.

<span id="iii.vi.iv-p5"></span>3. One of the prophets, when he saw
beforehand with the eye of the Divine Spirit that which was to be, was
so astonished at it that he cried out, “Who hath heard of such things,
and who hath spoken thus? Hath the earth brought forth in one day, and
hath a nation been born at once?” <span id="fr_66"></span>[67](#fn_66)
And the same prophet gives a hint also of the name by which the nation
was to be called, when he says, “Those that serve me shall be called by
a new name, which shall be blessed upon the earth.” <span
id="fr_67"></span>[68](#fn_67)

<span id="iii.vi.iv-p8"></span>4. But although it is clear that we are
new and that this new name of Christians has really but recently been
known among all nations, nevertheless our life and our conduct, with our
doctrines of religion, have not been lately invented by us, but from the
first creation of man, so to speak, have been established by the natural
understanding of divinely favored men of old. That this is so we shall
show in the following way.

<span id="iii.vi.iv-p9"></span>5. That the Hebrew nation is not new, but
is universally honored on account of its antiquity, is known to all. The
books and writings of this people contain accounts of ancient men, rare
indeed and few in number, but nevertheless distinguished for piety and
righteousness and every other virtue. Of these, some excellent men lived
before the flood, others of the sons and descendants of Noah lived after
it, among them Abraham, whom the Hebrews celebrate as their own founder
and forefather.

<span id="iii.vi.iv-p10"></span>6. If any one should assert that all
those who have enjoyed the testimony of righteousness, from Abraham
himself back to the first man, were Christians in fact if not in name,
he would not go beyond the truth. <span id="fr_68"></span>[69](#fn_68)

<span id="iii.vi.iv-p12"></span>7. For that which the name indicates,
that the Christian man, through the knowledge and the teaching of
Christ, is distinguished for temperance and righteousness, for patience
in life and manly virtue, and for a profession of piety toward the one
and only God over all—all that was zealously practiced by them not less
than by us.

<span id="iii.vi.iv-p13"></span>8. They did not care about circumcision
of the body, neither do we. They did not care about observing Sabbaths,
nor do we. They did not avoid certain kinds of food, neither did they
regard the other distinctions which Moses first delivered to their
posterity to be observed as symbols; nor do Christians of the present
day do such things. But they also clearly knew the very Christ of God;
for it has already been shown that he appeared unto Abraham, that he
imparted revelations to Isaac, that he talked with Jacob, that he held
converse with Moses and with the prophets that came after.

<span id="iii.vi.iv-p14"></span>9. Hence you will find those divinely
favored men honored with the name of Christ, according to the passage
which says of them, “Touch not my Christs, and do my prophets no
harm.” <span id="fr_69"></span>[70](#fn_69)

<span id="iii.vi.iv-p16"></span><span id="page_88">p. 88</span> <span
id="iii.vi.iv-Page_88"></span>10. So that it is clearly necessary to
consider that religion, which has lately been preached to all nations
through the teaching of Christ, the first and most ancient of all
religions, and the one discovered by those divinely favored men in the
age of Abraham.

<span id="iii.vi.iv-p17"></span>11. If it is said that Abraham, a long
time afterward, was given the command of circumcision, we reply that
nevertheless before this it was declared that he had received the
testimony of righteousness through faith; as the divine word says,
“Abraham believed in God, and it was counted unto him for
righteousness.” <span id="fr_70"></span>[71](#fn_70)

<span id="iii.vi.iv-p19"></span>12. And indeed unto Abraham, who was
thus before his circumcision a justified man, there was given by God,
who revealed himself unto him (but this was Christ himself, the word of
God), a prophecy in regard to those who in coming ages should be
justified in the same way as he. The prophecy was in the following
words: “And in thee shall all the tribes of the earth be blessed.” <span
id="fr_71"></span>[72](#fn_71) And again, “He shall become a nation
great and numerous; and in him shall all the nations of the earth be
blessed.” <span id="fr_72"></span>[73](#fn_72)

<span id="iii.vi.iv-p22"></span>13. It is permissible to understand this
as fulfilled in us. For he, having renounced the superstition of his
fathers, and the former error of his life, and having confessed the one
God over all, and having worshiped him with deeds of virtue, and not
with the service of the law which was afterward given by Moses, was
justified by faith in Christ, the Word of God, who appeared unto him. To
him, then, who was a man of this character, it was said that all the
tribes and all the nations of the earth should be blessed in him.

<span id="iii.vi.iv-p23"></span>14. But that very religion of Abraham
has reappeared at the present time, practiced in deeds, more efficacious
than words, by Christians alone throughout the world.

<span id="iii.vi.iv-p24"></span>15. What then should prevent the
confession that we who are of Christ practice one and the same mode of
life and have one and the same religion as those divinely favored men of
old? Whence it is evident that the perfect religion committed to us by
the teaching of Christ is not new and strange, but, if the truth must be
spoken, it is the first and the true religion. This may suffice for this
subject.
