Persecutors.*

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xxvi-p2"></span>“<span class="c13"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.xxvi-p2.1"></span>For</span> whoever have addressed
themselves with integrity of purpose to any course of action, keeping
the fear of God continually before their thoughts, and preserving an
unwavering faith in him, without allowing present fears or dangers to
outweigh their hope of future blessings—such persons, though for a
season they may have experienced painful trials, have borne their
afflictions lightly, being supported by the belief of greater rewards in
store for them; and their character has acquired a brighter luster in
proportion to the severity of their past sufferings. With regard, on the
other hand, to those who have either dishonorably slighted the
principles of justice, or refused to acknowledge the Supreme God
themselves, and yet have dared to subject others who have faithfully
maintained his worship to the most cruel insults and punishments; who
have failed equally to recognize their own wretchedness in oppressing
others on such grounds, and the happiness and blessing of those who
preserved their devotion to God even in the midst of such sufferings:
with regard, I say, to such men, many a time have their armies been
slaughtered, many a time have they been put to flight; and their warlike
preparations have ended in total ruin and defeat.
