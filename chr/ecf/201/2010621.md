<span id="iv.vi.iv.xxxv-Page_549"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.xxxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXV</span>.—*Constantine’s
Letter to Eusebius, in praise of his Discourse concerning Easter.*

<span id="iv.vi.iv.xxxv-p2"></span>“<span class="c13"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.xxxv-p2.1"></span>Victor Constantinus, Maximus
Augustus,</span> to Eusebius.

<span id="iv.vi.iv.xxxv-p3"></span>“It is indeed an arduous task, and
beyond the power of language itself, worthily to treat of the mysteries
of Christ, and to explain in a fitting manner the controversy respecting
the feast of Easter, its origin as well as its precious and toilsome
accomplishment. <span id="fr_3331"></span>[3332](#fn_3331) For it is not
in the power even of those who are able to apprehend them, adequately to
describe the things of God. I am, notwithstanding, filled with
admiration of your learning and zeal, and have not only myself read your
work with pleasure, but have given directions, according to your own
desire, that it be communicated to many sincere followers of our holy
religion. Seeing, then, with what pleasure we receive favors of this
kind from your Sagacity, be pleased to gladden us more frequently with
those compositions, to the practice of which, indeed, you confess
yourself to have been trained from an early period, so that I am urging
a willing man, as they say, in exhorting you to your customary pursuits.
And certainly the high and confident judgment we entertain is a proof
that the person who has translated your writings into the Latin tongue
is in no respect incompetent to the task, impossible though it be that
such version should fully equal the excellence of the works themselves.
God preserve you, beloved brother.” Such was his letter on this subject:
and that which related to the providing of copies of the Scriptures for
reading in the churches was to the following purport.
