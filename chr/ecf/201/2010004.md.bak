<span id="iii.ii-p2"></span>————————————

<span id="iii.ii-p3"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.ii-p3.1"></span>The</span> present translation of the Church
History of Eusebius has been made from Heinichen’s second edition of the
Greek text, but variant readings have been adopted without hesitation
whenever they have approved themselves to my judgment. In all such cases
the variation from Heinichen’s text has been indicated in the notes. A
simple revision of Crusè’s English version was originally proposed, but
a brief examination of it was sufficient to convince me that a
satisfactory revision would be an almost hopeless task, and that nothing
short of a new and independent translation ought to be undertaken. In
the preparation of that translation, invaluable assistance has been
rendered by my father, the Rev. Joseph N. McGiffert, D.D., for whose
help and counsel I desire thus publicly to give expression to my
profound gratitude. The entire translation has been examined by him and
owes much to his timely suggestions and criticisms; while the
translation itself of a considerable portion of the work (Bks. V.–VIII.
and the Martyrs of Palestine) is from his hand. The part thus rendered
by him I have carefully revised for the purpose of securing uniformity
in style and expression throughout the entire work, and I therefore hold
myself alone responsible for it as well as for the earlier and later
books. As to the principle upon which the translation has been made,
little need be said. The constant endeavor has been to reproduce as
nearly as possible, both the substance and form of the original, and in
view of the peculiar need of accuracy in such a work as the present, it
has seemed better in doubtful cases to run the risk of erring in the
direction of over-literalness rather than in that of undue license.

<span id="iii.ii-p4"></span>A word of explanation in regard to the notes
which accompany the text may not be out of place. In view of the popular
character of the series of which the present volume forms a part, it
seemed important that the notes should contain much supplementary
information in regard to persons, places, and events mentioned in the
text which might be quite superfluous to the professional historian as
well as to the student enjoying access to libraries rich in historical
and bibliographical material, and I have therefore not felt justified in
confining myself to such questions as might interest only the critical
scholar. Requested by the general editor to make the work in some sense
a general history of, or historical commentary upon, the first three
centuries of the Christian Church, I have ventured to devote
considerable space to a fuller presentation of various subjects but
briefly touched upon or merely referred to by Eusebius. At the same time
my chief endeavor has been, by a careful study of difficult and disputed
points, to do all that I could for their elucidation, and thus to
perform as faithfully as possible the paramount duty of a commentator.
The number and fulness of the notes needed in such a work must of course
be matter of dispute, but annoyed as I have repeatedly been by the
fragmentary character of the annotations in the existing editions of the
work, I have been anxious to avoid that defect, and have therefore
passed by no passage which seemed to me to need discussion, nor
consciously evaded any difficulty. Working with historical students
constantly in mind I have felt it due to them to fortify all my
statements by references to the authorities upon which they have been
based, and to indicate at the same time with sufficient fullness the
sources whose examination a fuller investigation of the subject on their
part might render necessary. The modern works which have been most
helpful are mentioned in the notes, but I cannot in justice refrain from
making espe<span id="page_x">p. x</span> <span
id="iii.ii-Page_x"></span>cial reference at this point to Smith and
Wace’s *Dictionary of Christian Biography* which has been constantly at
my side, and to the first and second volumes of Schaff’s *Church
History*, whose bibliographies have been especially serviceable. Many of
Valesius’ notes have been found very suggestive and must always remain
valuable in spite of the great advance made in historical knowledge
since his day. For the commentary of Heinichen less can be said.
Richardson’s *Bibliographical Synopsis*, published as a supplement to
the Ante-Nicene Library, did not come into my hands until the greater
part of the work was completed. In the preparation of the notes upon the
latter portion it proved helpful, and its existence has enabled me
throughout the work to omit extended lists of books which it would
otherwise have been necessary to give.

<span id="iii.ii-p5"></span>It was my privilege some three years ago to
study portions of the fourth and fifth books of Eusebius’ Church History
with Professor Adolf Harnack in his *Seminar* at Marburg. Especial
thanks are due for the help and inspiration gained from that eminent
scholar, and for the light thrown by him upon many difficult passages in
those portions of the work.

<span id="iii.ii-p6"></span>It gives me pleasure also to express my
obligation to Dr. Isaac G. Hall, of New York, and to Dr. E. C.
Richardson, of Hartford, for information furnished by them in regard to
certain editions of the History, also to the Rev. Charles R. Gillett,
Librarian of Union Theological Seminary, and to the Rev. J. H. Dulles,
Librarian of Princeton Theological Seminary, for their kindness in
granting me the privileges of the libraries under their charge, and for
their unfailing courtesy shown me in many ways. To Mr. James McDonald,
of Shelbyville, Ky., my thanks are due for his translation of the
Testimonies for and against Eusebius, printed at the close of the
Prolegomena, and to Mr. F. E. Moore, of New Albany, Ind., for assistance
rendered in connection with the preparation of the indexes.
