<span id="iv.vi.iii.lvii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.lvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter LVII</span>.—*How the Gentiles
abandoned Idol Worship, and turned to the Knowledge of God.*

<span id="iv.vi.iii.lvii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.lvii-p2.1"></span>Hence</span> it was that, of those who
had been the slaves of superstition, when they saw with their own eyes
the exposure of their delusion, and beheld the actual ruin of the
temples and images in every place, some applied themselves to the saving
doctrine of Christ; while others, though they declined to take this
step, yet reprobated the folly which they had received from their
fathers, and laughed to scorn what they had so long been accustomed to
regard as gods. Indeed, what other feelings could possess their minds,
when they witnessed the thorough uncleanness concealed beneath the fair
exterior of the objects of their worship? Beneath this were found either
the bones of dead men or dry skulls, fraudulently adorned by the arts of
magicians, <span id="fr_3291"></span>[3292](#fn_3291.md) or filthy rags
full of abominable impurity, or a bundle of hay or stubble. On seeing
all these things heaped together within their lifeless images, they
denounced their fathers’ extreme folly and their own, especially when
neither in the secret recesses of the temples nor in the statues
themselves could any inmate be found; neither demon, nor utterer of
oracles, neither god nor prophet, as they had heretofore supposed: nay,
not even a dim and shadowy phantom could be seen. Accordingly, every
gloomy cavern, every hidden recess, afforded easy access to the
emperor’s emissaries: the inaccessible and secret chambers, the
innermost shrines of the temples, were trampled by the soldiers’ feet;
and thus the mental blindness which had prevailed for so many ages over
the gentile world became clearly apparent to the eyes of all.
