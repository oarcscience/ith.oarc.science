<span id="iv.iii.i.i-p9"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.iii.i.i-p9.1"></span>The</span> Emperor Flavius Valerius
Constantinus, surnamed the Great, <span
id="fr_2991"></span>[2992](#fn_2991.md) born February 27, 272 or 274, <span
id="fr_2992"></span>[2993](#fn_2992.md) at Naïssus, <span
id="fr_2993"></span>[2994](#fn_2993.md) was son of Constantius Chlorus,
afterwards Emperor, <span id="fr_2994"></span>[2995](#fn_2994.md) and
Helena his wife. <span id="fr_2995"></span>[2996](#fn_2995.md) He was
brought up at Drepanum, his mother’s home, <span
id="fr_2996"></span>[2997](#fn_2996.md) where he remained until his father
became <span id="page_412">p. 412</span> <span
id="iv.iii.i.i-Page_412"></span>Cæsar (<span class="c13"><span
id="iv.iii.i.i-p17.1"></span>a.d.</span> 292 acc. to Clinton) and
divorced Helena (Anon. Vales. p. 471). He was then sent to the court of
Diocletian, nominally to be educated (Praxagoras, in Müller, *Fragm.* 4
(1868); Zonar. 13. 1, &c.), but really as hostage, <span
id="fr_2997"></span>[2998](#fn_2997.md) and remained with Diocletian, or
Galerius, until the year 306. <span id="fr_2998"></span>[2999](#fn_2998.md)
During this time he took part in various campaigns, including the famous
Egyptian expedition of Diocletian in 296 (Euseb. *V. C.* 1. 19; Anon.
Metroph., Theoph. p. 10). <span id="fr_2999"></span>[3000](#fn_2999.md)
Shortly after joining the emperor he contracted (296 or 297) his
alliance with Minervina, <span id="fr_3000"></span>[3001](#fn_3000.md) by
whom he had a son, Crispus. <span id="fr_3001"></span>[3002](#fn_3001.md)
He was at Nicomedia when Diocletian’s palace was struck by lightning
(Const. *Orat.* 35), and was present at the abdication of Diocletian and
Maximinus in 305 (Lact. *De M. P.* c. 18 sq.). This last event proved a
crisis for Constantine. He had grown to be a man of fine physique (Lact.
c. 18; Euseb. *V. C.* 1. 19), of proved courage and military skill (cf.
remarks on physical characteristics under *Character*), and a general
favorite (Lact. l.c.). He had already “long before” (Lact. c. 18) been
created Tribune of the first order. It was both natural and fitting that
at this time he should become Cæsar in the place of his father, who
became Augustus. Every one supposed he would be chosen (c. 19), and
Diocletian urged it (c. 18), but the princely youth was too able and
illustrious to please Galerius, and Constantine was set aside for
obscure and incompetent men (cf. Lact.). His position was far from easy
before. His brilliant parts naturally aroused the jealousy and
suspicions of the emperors. They, or at least Galerius, even sought his
death, it is said, by tempting him to fight wild beasts (a lion, Praxag.
p. 3; cf. Zonaras 2, p. 623), or exposing him to special danger in
battle (cf. Philistog. 1. 6; Lact. c. 24; Anon. Vales. p. 471;
Theophanes p. 10–12, &c.). The situation, hard enough before, now
became, we may well believe, intolerable. He was humiliated,
handicapped, and even in danger of his life. He was practically a
prisoner. The problem was, how to get away. Several times Constantius
asked that his son might be allowed to join him, but in vain (Lact. c.
24; Anon. Vales. p. 471). Finally, however, Constantine gained a
grudging permission to go. It was given at night, and the emperor
intended to take it back in the morning (Lact. c. 24). But in the
morning it was too late. Constantine had left at once to join his
father. He lost no time either in starting or making the journey. Each
relay of post horses which he left was maimed to baffle pursuit (Anon.
Vales., Vict. *Epit.* p. 49; cf. Lact. c. 24, Praxag. p. 3). The rage of
the emperor when he learned of the flight was great but vain.
Constantine was already out of reach, and soon joined his father at
Bononia (Boulogne, Anon. Vales.; cf. Eumen. *Paneg.* (310), c. 7), <span
id="fr_3002"></span>[3003](#fn_3002.md) just in time to accompany him on
his final expeditions to Britain (Eumen. *Paneg*. (310) c. 7; cf. Anon.
Vales. l.c.). Constantius died shortly after at York (Anon. Vales. p.
471; Eutrop. 10. 1), having named Constantine as his successor (Euseb.
*V. C.* 1. 21; Eumen. *Paneg.* (310) c. 7.; Lact. c. 24).

<span id="fn_2990"></span>[411:2991](2010342.htm#fr_2990.md) <span
id="iv.iii.i.i-p6.2"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.i.i-p7"></span> This sketch of the life of Constantine
is intended to give the thread of events, and briefly to supplement,
especially for the earlier part of his reign, the life by Eusebius,
which is distinctly confined to his religious acts and life.

<span id="fn_2991"></span>[411:2992](2010342.htm#fr_2991.md) <span

Proconsul Pontifex Maximus, Magnus, Maximus, Pius, Felix, Fidelis,
Mansuetus, Benificus, Clementissimus, Victor, Invictus, Triumphator,
Salus Reip. Beticus, Alemanicus, Gothicus, Sarmarticus, Germanicus,
Britannicus, Hunnicus, Gallicanus,” is a portion of his title, as
gathered from coins, inscriptions, and various documents.

p. 113. The date varies by a year or two, according to way of reckoning,
but 274 is the date usually given. (Cf. Burckhardt, Manso, Keim, De
Broglie, Wordsworth, etc.) Eutropius and Hieronymus say he died in his
sixty-sixth year, Theophanes says he was sixty-five years old, and
Socrates and Sozomen say substantially the same, while Victor, *Epit.*
has sixty-three, and Victor, *Cæs*. sixty-two. Eusebius says he lived
twice the length of his reign, i.e. 63 +.

<span id="iv.iii.i.i-p12"></span>Manso chose 274, because it agreed best
with the representations of the two Victors as over against the “later
church historians.” But the two Victors say, one that he lived sixty-two
years and reigned thirty-two, and the other that he lived sixty-three
and reigned thirty; while Eutropius, secretary to Constantine, gives
length of reign correctly, and so establishes a slight presumption in
favor of his other statement. Moreover, it is supported by Hieronymus,
whose testimony is not of the highest quality, to be sure, and is quite
likely taken from Eutropius, and Theophanes, who puts the same fact in
another form, and who certainly chose that figure for a reason. The
statement of Eusebius is a very elastic generalization, and is the only
support of Victor, *Epit*. Socrates, who, according to Wordsworth, says
he was in his sixty-fifth year, uses the idiom “mounting upon” (<span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.iii.i.i-p12.1"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.iii.i.i-p12.2"></span>πιβ€ς</span>)
sixty-five years, which at the least must mean nearly sixty-five years
old, and unless there is some well-established usage to the contrary,
seems to mean having lived already sixty-five years. In the
interpretation of Sozomen (also given in *translation* “in his
sixty-fifth year”) he was “about” sixty-five years old. Now if he died
in May, his following birthday would not have been as “about,” and he
must have been a little over sixty-five. This would make a strong
consensus against Victor, against whom Eutropius alone would have a
presumption of accuracy. On the whole it may be said that in the
evidence, so far as cited by Manso, Wordsworth, Clinton, and the run of
historians, there is no critical justification for the choice of the
later date and the shorter life.

“Firmicus 1. 4.” According to some it was Tarsus (“Julius Firmic. 1.
2”), or Drepanum (Niceph. Callist.), or in Britain (the English
chroniclers, Voragine, and others, the mistake arising from one of the
panegyrists (c. 4) speaking of his taking his origin thence), or Trèves
(Voragine). Compare Vogt, who adds Rome (“Petr. de Natalibus”), or Roba
(“Eutychius”), or Gaul (“Meursius”). Compare also monographs by Janus
and by Schoepflin under *Literature.*

<span id="fn_2994"></span>[411:2995](2010342.htm#fr_2994.md) <span
id="iv.iii.i.i-p13.2"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.i.i-p14"></span> For characterization of Constantius
compare *V. C.* 1. 13 sq.

<span id="fn_2995"></span>[411:2996](2010342.htm#fr_2995.md) <span
id="iv.iii.i.i-p14.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.i.i-p15"></span> It has been a much discussed question,
whether Helena was legitimate wife or not. Some (Zosimus 2. 8; Niceph.
Callist. 7. 18) have asserted that Helena was a woman “indifferent
honest,” and the birth of Constantine illegitimate. This view is simply
psychologically impossible regarding a woman of so much and such
strength of character. That she stood in the relation of legitimate
concubinage (cf. Smith and Cheetham, *Dict.* 1. 422) is not improbable,
since many (Hieron. Orosius, Zosimus 2.8; Chron. Pasch. p. 516, and
others) assert this lesser relationship. This would have been not unlike
a modern morganatic marriage. The facts are: 1. That she is often spoken
of as concubine (cf. above). 2. That she is distinctly called wife, and
that by some of the most competent authorities (Eutrop. 10. 2; Anon.
Vales. p. 471; Euseb. *H. E.* 8. 13; Ephraem p. 21, etc.), also in
various inscriptions (compare collected inscriptions in Clinton 2. 81).
3. That she was divorced (Anon. Vales. p. 47). The weight of testimony
is clearly in favor of the word “wife,” though with divorce so easy it
seems to have been a name only. The view that she was married in the
full legal sense, but only after the birth of Constantine, is plausible
enough, and has a support more apparent than real, in the fact that he
“first established that natural children should be made legitimate by
the subsequent marriage of their parents” (Sandars *Inst. Just.* (1865)
113; cf. Cod. Just. V. xxvii. 1 and 5 ed. Krueger 2 (1877) 216).

<span id="iv.iii.i.i-p16"></span>Of course the story of her violation by
and subsequent marriage to Constantius (Inc. auct. ed. Heydenreich) is
purely legendary, and the same may be said of the somewhat
circumstantial account of her relation as concubine, given by Nicephorus
Callistus 7, 18. For farther account of Helena, compare the *V. C.* 3.
42 and notes.

<span id="fn_2996"></span>[411:2997](2010342.htm#fr_2996.md) <span
id="iv.iii.i.i-p16.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.i.i-p17"></span> Helena was born probably at Drepanum,
afterwards called Helenopolis, in her honor, by Constantine (Procopius
*De ædif.* V. 2, p. 311, Chron. Pasch. etc.).

<span id="fn_2997"></span>[412:2998](2010342.htm#fr_2997.md) <span
id="iv.iii.i.i-p17.2"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.i.i-p18"></span> This appears from the disregard of his
father’s repeated requests that he be sent back to him (Lact., Anon.
Vales. p. 471), and the whole story of his final flight. So also it is
said by Anon. Vales. p. 471, and the two Victors (*Cæs.* p. 156, *Epit.*
p. 49). Zonaras (12. 33, ed. Migne 1091), gives both reasons for
sending, and is likely right. Nicephorus Callistus (7. 18) suggests that
he was sent there for education, since Constantius could not take him
himself on account of Theodora.

<span id="fn_2998"></span>[412:2999](2010342.htm#fr_2998.md) <span
id="iv.iii.i.i-p18.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.i.i-p19"></span> He was with Diocletian still in 305
(cf. Lact. and note, below), and was with his father early in 306.

<span id="fn_2999"></span>[412:3000](2010342.htm#fr_2999.md) <span
id="iv.iii.i.i-p19.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.i.i-p20"></span> Eusebius, who saw him on his way to
Egypt in 296, gives the impression which he made on him at that time
(l.c.). According to some he was also with Galerius in his Persian war,
and this is possible (cf. Clinton 1. 338–40). Theophanes describes him
as “already eminent in war” (p. 10), Anon. Vales. p. 471, as conducting
himself “bravely.”

<span id="fn_3000"></span>[412:3001](2010342.htm#fr_3000.md) <span
id="iv.iii.i.i-p20.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.i.i-p21"></span> This was probably a morganatic
marriage or concubinate (Victor, *Epit.* 41, Zosimus 2. 20; Zonaras 13.
2, &c.). “The improbability that Constantine should have marked out an
illegitimate son as his successor” which Ramsay (Smith, *Dict.* 2. 1090)
mentions as the only argument against, is reduced to a minimum in view
of Constantine’s law for the legitimization of natural children by
rescript (Cod. Just. V. xxvii. ed. Krueger 2 (1877), 216–17; cf. notes
of Sandars in his *Inst. Just.* (1865) 113). It would be uncritical, as
in the case before mentioned, to lay stress on this as positive
evidence, but over against a simple “improbability” it has a certain
suggestiveness at least. The panegyrical praises of Constantine’s
continence hardly justify Clinton’s claim that she was lawful wife; for
to have a regular concubine would not have been considered in any sense
immoral, and it would not have been particularly pertinent in a wedding
oration to have introduced even a former wife. For what little is known
of Minervina, compare Ramsay, in Smith *Dict.* 2. 1090, “Tillemont,
*Hist. Emp.* IV. iv. p. 84,” and Clinton, *Fasti Rom.* 2. (1850) 86,
note *k.*

<span id="fn_3001"></span>[412:3002](2010342.htm#fr_3001.md) <span
id="iv.iii.i.i-p21.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.i.i-p22"></span> Crispus was “already a young man” when
made Cæsar in 317 (Zos. 2. 30).

<span id="fn_3002"></span>[412:3003](2010342.htm#fr_3002.md) <span
id="iv.iii.i.i-p22.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.i.i-p23"></span> According to some (e.g. Victor, *Cæs.*
p. 156; Victor, *Epit.* p. 51; Zos. 2. 8) his father was already in
Britain.
