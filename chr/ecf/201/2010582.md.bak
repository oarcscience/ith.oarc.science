<span id="iv.vi.iii.lxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.lxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter LXIII</span>.—*How he displayed
his Zeal for the Extirpation of Heresies.*

<span id="iv.vi.iii.lxiii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.lxiii-p2.1"></span>Such</span> were the exhortations to do
all things to the honor of the divine religion which the emperor
addressed to the rulers of the churches. Having by these means banished
dissension, and <span id="page_539">p. 539</span> <span
id="iv.vi.iii.lxiii-Page_539"></span>reduced the Church of God to a
state of uniform harmony, he next proceeded to a different duty, feeling
it incumbent on him to extirpate another sort of impious persons, as
pernicious enemies of the human race. These were pests of society, who
ruined whole cities under the specious garb of religious decorum; men
whom our Saviour’s warning voice somewhere terms false prophets and
ravenous wolves: “Beware of false prophets, which will come to you in
sheep’s clothing, but inwardly are ravening wolves. By their fruits ye
shall know them.” <span id="fr_3302"></span>[3303](#fn_3302.md)
Accordingly, by an order transmitted to the governors of the several
provinces, he effectually banished all such offenders. In addition to
this ordinance he addressed to them personally a severely awakening
admonition, exhorting them to an earnest repentance, that they might
still find a haven of safety in the true Church of God. Hear, then, in
what manner he addressed them in this letter.
