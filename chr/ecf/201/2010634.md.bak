<span id="iv.vi.iv.xlviii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.xlviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLVIII</span>.—*That
Constantine was displeased with one who praised him excessively.*

<span id="iv.vi.iv.xlviii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.xlviii-p2.1"></span>And</span> now that all these
ceremonies were completed, and the divine qualities of the emperor’s
character continued to be the theme of universal praise, one of God’s
ministers presumed so far as in his own presence to pronounce him
blessed, as having been counted worthy to hold absolute and universal
empire in this life, and as being destined to share the empire of the
Son of God in the world to come. These words, however, Constantine heard
with indignation, and forbade the speaker to hold such language,
exhorting him rather to pray earnestly on his behalf, that whether in
this life or in that which is to come, he might be found worthy to be a
servant of God. <span id="fr_3345"></span>[3346](#fn_3345.md)

Oration uses language almost as obnoxious, and records that Constantine
was much pleased with it. The difference was probably one of
gracefulness.
