<span id="iv.vi.iv.li-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.li-p1.1"></span>Chapter LI</span>.—*That Constantine
divided the Empire between his Three Sons, whom he had instructed in
Politics and Religion.*

<span id="iv.vi.iv.li-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.li-p2.1"></span>Having</span> thus established his power in
the opposite extremities of the world, he divided the whole extent of
his dominions, as though he were allotting a patrimonial inheritance to
the dearest objects of his regard, among his three sons. To the eldest
he assigned his grandfather’s portion; to the second, the empire of the
East; to the third, the countries which lie between these two
divisions. <span id="fr_3347"></span>[3348](#fn_3347.md) And being desirous
of furnishing his children with an inheritance truly valuable and
salutary to their souls, he had been careful to imbue them with true
religious principles, being himself their guide to the knowledge of
sacred things, and also appointing men of approved piety to be their
instructors. At the same time he assigned them the most accomplished
teachers of secular learning, by some of whom they were taught the arts
of war, while they were trained by others in political, and by others
again in legal science. To each moreover was granted a truly royal
retinue, consisting of infantry, spearmen, and body guards, with every
other kind of military force; commanded respectively by captains,
tribunes, and generals <span id="fr_3348"></span>[3349](#fn_3348.md) of
whose warlike skill and devotion to his sons the emperor had had
previous experience.

appointed to hold his court in Gaul; and his brother Constantius
exchanged that department, the ancient patrimony of their father, for
the more opulent, but less martial, countries of the East. Italy, the
Western Illyricum, and Africa, were accustomed to revere Constans, the
third of his sons, as the representative of the great Constantine”
