<span id="iv.iv.iii-p2"></span>The *Editions* and *Translations* of this
work are substantially identical with those of the Life, above, but some
of the earlier ones do not contain the work. It was delivered in the
year 336 (or possibly 335) at Constantinople, in celebration of the
thirtieth anniversary of Constantine’s accession, Constantine himself
being present (cf. *V.C.* 4. 46 and O.C. 1). It gave the emperor lively
satisfaction, from which one may safely infer a peculiar taste for
combined panegyric and philosophical theology unless the hypothesis of a
double work be true. According to this hypothesis the work consists of
two separate orations, spoken perhaps at different times, the first
including chapters 1–10, which are panegyrical in character, and the
other chapters 11–18, which are theological (compare Lightfoot,
Eusebius, p. 343; also McGiffert, Prolegomena, p. 43). It is like the
oration of Constantine, a proper part of the Life of Constantine being
appended according to his promise in Bk. 4, ch. 46.

works are treated in the notes.
