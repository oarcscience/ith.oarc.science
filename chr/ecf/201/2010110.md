<span id="iii.ix.i-p3"></span> We still have lists of bishops as old as
the end of the second century. The most ancient is that of the Roman
bishops given by Irenæus (III. 3. 3); but this has no dates. The list is
probably the official catalogue as it had been handed down to the time
of Eleutherus; but it is not authentic, as there was no monarchical
episcopate in Rome at the time of Clement, nor even in the time of
Hermas. For other churches the oldest lists date from the end of the
third century. According to one interpretation of a passage from
Hegesippus, quoted in chapter 22, below, Hegesippus drew up a list of
Roman bishops down to the time of Anicetus; and Bishop Lightfoot thinks
he has discovered this lost catalogue in Epiphanius, *Hær*. XXVII. 6
(see his article in the *Academy* for May 27, 1887). If Lightfoot is
right, we have recovered the oldest Papal catalogue; but it is very
doubtful whether Hegesippus composed such a catalogue (see note on chap.
22), and even if he did, it is uncertain whether the list which
Epiphanius gives is identical with it. See the writer’s notice of
Lightfoot’s article in the *Theologische Literatur-Zeitung*, 1887; No.
18, Col. 435<span id="iii.ix.i-p3.1"></span> sqq.

<span id="iii.ix.i-p4"></span>The list of Roman bishops which Eusebius
gives is the same as that of Irenæus; but it has dates, while Irenæus’
has none. From what source Eusebius took his dates we do not know. His
*Chronicle* contains different dates. It is possible that the difference
is owing, in part, to defective transcriptions or translations; but it
is more probable that Eusebius himself discovered another source, before
writing his *History*, which he considered more authentic, and therefore
substituted for the one he has used in his *Chronicle*. Lipsius
(*Chronologie der römischen Bischöfe*, p. 145) says, “We may assume that
the oldest catalogue extended as far as Eleutherus, but rested upon
historical knowledge only from Xystus, or, at the farthest, from
Alexander down.” On the chronology of the Roman bishops in general, see
especially the important work of Lipsius just referred to.

<span id="iii.ix.i-p7"></span> The *Chronicle* of Eusebius (Armenian)
makes Primus succeed to the bishopric of Alexandria in the eleventh year
of Trajan; the version of Jerome, in the ninth. According to chap. 4,
below, he held office twelve years. No reliance can be placed upon any
of the figures. The Alexandrian church is shrouded in darkness until the
latter part of the second century, and all extant traditions in regard
to its history before that time are about equally worthless. Of Primus
himself we have no authentic knowledge, though he figures somewhat in
later tradition. See Smith and Wace’s *Dict. of Christian Biography*,
*in loco*.

<span id="iii.ix.i-p9"></span> According to the *Chronicle* of Eusebius
(Armenian), Alexander became bishop of Rome in the eighth year of
Trajan; according to Jerome’s version, in the twelfth year. He is said,
in chap. 4, below, to have died in the third year of Hadrian, after
holding office ten years. On the reliability of these dates, see note 1,
above. Of Alexander’s life and character we know nothing.
