<span id="iv.iii.i.vi-p1"></span> §6. *Fourth Five Years.*

<span id="iv.iii.i.vi-p2"></span>If the third period was relatively
quiet the fourth was absolutely stirring. There had undoubtedly been
more or less fighting along the Danube frontier during the preceding
years, but early in this period there was a most important campaign
against the Sarmatians, in which they were defeated and their king taken
prisoner. <span id="fr_3028"></span>[3029](#fn_3028) In honor of this
victory coins were struck (Eckhel, *Doct. Num. Vet.* 8 (1827) 87). But
this was only skirmishing; afterwards came the tug of war. Nine years of
peace proved the utmost limit of mutual patience, and Constantine and
Licinius came to words, and from words to blows. For a long time
Constantine had been vexed at the persecution of the Christians by
Licinius (cf. Euseb. *H. E.* 10. 8, 9), persecutions waged perhaps with
the express purpose of aggravating him. <span
id="fr_3029"></span>[3030](#fn_3029) Licinius, on the other hand,
naturally chagrined over the previous loss of territory, knowing of
Constantine’s indignation over his persecutions, and perhaps suspecting
him of further designs, was naturally suspicious when Constantine passed
within his boundaries in pursuing the Sarmatians (Anon. Vales. p. 474).
Mutual recriminations and aggravations followed. Licinius would not let
the Sarmatian coins pass current and had them melted down (Anon. Contin.
Dio. Cass., in Müller, *Fragm. Hist*. Gr. 4 \[1868\] 199). Altogether
they soon came to blows. The steps were short, sharp, decisive.
Constantine defeated Licinius by land (July 3, 323), and through
Crispus, by sea (Soz. 1. 7; Anon. Vales. p. 474–5; Zos. 2. 22–3). After
the defeat at Adrianople, Licinius retreated to Byzantium (Zos. 2. 23–5;
Vict. <span id="page_419">p. 419</span> <span
id="iv.iii.i.vi-Page_419"></span>*Epit*. p. 50), and then to Chalcedon
(Anon. Vales. p. 475, Zos. 2. 25–6). Two months after the first victory
(Sept. 18) a final and decisive battle was fought at Chrysopolis <span
id="fr_3030"></span>[3031](#fn_3030) (Anon. Vales. p. 475; Socr. 1. 4).
Licinius surrendered on condition that his life should be spared (Zos.
2. 28), or rather Constantia secured from her brother the promise that
his life should be spared (Anon. Vales. p. 475; Vict. *Epit.* p. 50;
Pseudo-Leo, p. 85, &c.). He retired to Nicomedia, residing at
Thessalonica (Soz. 1. 7; Pseudo-Leo, &c.), but was put to death the
following year. <span id="fr_3031"></span>[3032](#fn_3031) Constantine
was now sole emperor. His first act (Soz. 1. 8) was to issue a
proclamation in favor of the Christians (Soz. *l.c.*; *V. C.* 2. 24- ,
and 48- ). This was followed by many other acts in their favor,—building
of churches, &c. (cf. Euseb. *V. C.,* and notes). From this time on he
was much identified with Christian affairs, and the main events are
given *in extenso* by Eusebius (see various notes). In 325 (June 19-Aug.
25) the Council of Nicæa was held (cf. Euseb. *V. C.* 3. 6, and notes),
and Constantine took an active part in its proceedings. The same year
his Vicennalia were celebrated at Nicomedia (Euseb. *V. C.* 1. 1;
Hieron.; Cassiod.) and the following year at Rome also (Hieron.,
Cassiod., Prosper, Idat.), Constantine being present at both
celebrations, <span id="fr_3032"></span>[3033](#fn_3032) being thus at
Rome in July, and passing during the year as far as Arles, apparently
spending some time at Milan (cf. the various laws in Clinton, v. 2, p.
92).

<span id="iv.iii.i.vi-p3"></span> Zos. 2. 21. An exhaustive discussion
of this is that by Bessell, *Gothen,* in Ersch u. Gruber, *Encykl.* I.
75 (Leipz. 1862), 132–33. The same article (p. 133–35) discusses various
relations of Goths and Sarmatians with Constantine.

<span id="fn_3029"></span>[418:3030](2010347.htm#fr_3029) <span
id="iv.iii.i.vi-p3.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.i.vi-p4"></span> According to Sozomen, Licinius
withdrew his favor from Christians and persecuted them, because “He was
deeply incensed against the Christians on account of his disagreement
with Constantine, and thought to wound him by their sufferings; and,
besides, he suspected that they earnestly desired that Constantine
should enjoy the sovereign rule” (1. 7). In this view of the case, it is
easy to see how and why affairs marched as they did. Eusebius (*H. E.*
10. 9) makes this, like the war against Maxentius, a real crusade in
behalf of the persecuted Christians.
