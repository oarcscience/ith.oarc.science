<span id="iv.vi.iv.xxxi-p3"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.xxxi-p3.1"></span>Meantime</span>, since there was no fear
of capital punishment to deter from the commission of crime, for the
emperor himself was uniformly inclined to clemency, and none of the
provincial governors visited offenses with their proper penalties, this
state of things drew with it no small degree of blame on the general
administration of the empire; whether justly or not, let every one form
his own judgment: for myself, I only ask permission to record the fact.
