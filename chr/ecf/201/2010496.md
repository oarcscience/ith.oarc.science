<span id="iv.vi.ii.li-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.li-p1.1"></span>Chapter LI</span>.—*That Constantine, when
a Youth, heard from him who wrote the Persecution Edict that “the
Righteous Men” were the Christians.*

<span id="iv.vi.ii.li-p2"></span>“<span class="c13"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.li-p2.1"></span>I call</span> now on thee, most high God,
to witness that, when young, I heard him who at that time was chief
among the Roman emperors, unhappy, truly unhappy as he was, and laboring
under mental delusion, make earnest enquiry of his attendants as to who
these righteous ones on earth were, and that one of the Pagan priests
then <span id="page_513">p. 513</span> <span
id="iv.vi.ii.li-Page_513"></span>present replied that they were
doubtless the Christians. This answer he eagerly received, like some
honeyed draught, and unsheathed the sword which was ordained for the
punishment of crime, against those whose holiness was beyond reproach.
Immediately, therefore, he issued those sanguinary edicts, traced, if I
may so express myself, with a sword’s point dipped in blood; at the same
time commanding his judges to tax their ingenuity for the invention of
new and more terrible punishments.
