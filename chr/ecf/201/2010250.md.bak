<span id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXII.—</span>*The Distinguished
Ecclesiastics* <span id="fr_2435"></span>[2436](#fn_2435.md) *of our Day,
and which of them survived until the Destruction of the Churches.*

<span id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p3"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p3.1"></span>At</span> this time, Felix, <span
id="fr_2436"></span>[2437](#fn_2436.md) having presided over the church of
Rome for five years, was succeeded by Eutychianus, <span
id="fr_2437"></span>[2438](#fn_2437.md) but he in less than ten months left
the position to Caius, <span id="fr_2438"></span>[2439](#fn_2438.md) who
lived in our day. He held it about fifteen years, and was in turn
succeeded by Marcellinus, <span id="fr_2439"></span>[2440](#fn_2439.md) who
was overtaken by the persecution.

<span id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p8"></span>2. About the same time Timæus <span
id="fr_2440"></span>[2441](#fn_2440.md) received the episcopate of Antioch
after Domnus, <span id="fr_2441"></span>[2442](#fn_2441.md) and
Cyril, <span id="fr_2442"></span>[2443](#fn_2442.md) who lived in our day,
succeeded him. In his time we became acquainted with Dorotheus, <span
id="fr_2443"></span>[2444](#fn_2443.md) a man of learning among those of
his day, who was honored with the office of presbyter in Antioch. He was
a lover of the beautiful in divine things, and devoted himself to the
Hebrew language, so that he read the Hebrew Scriptures with
facility. <span id="fr_2444"></span>[2445](#fn_2444.md)

<span id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p14"></span>3. He belonged to those who were
especially liberal, and was not unacquainted with Grecian
propædeutics. <span id="fr_2445"></span>[2446](#fn_2445.md) Besides this he
was a eunuch, <span id="fr_2446"></span>[2447](#fn_2446.md) having been so
from his very birth. On this account, as if it were a miracle, the
emperor <span id="fr_2447"></span>[2448](#fn_2447.md) took him into his
family, and honored him by placing him over the purple dye-works at
Tyre. We have heard him expound the Scriptures wisely in the Church.

<span id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p18"></span>4. After Cyril, Tyrannus <span
id="fr_2448"></span>[2449](#fn_2448.md) re<span id="page_318">p. 318</span>
<span id="iii.xii.xxxiii-Page_318"></span>ceived the episcopate of the
parish of Antioch. In his time occurred the destruction of the churches.

<span id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p20"></span>5. Eusebius, <span
id="fr_2449"></span>[2450](#fn_2449.md) who had come from the city of
Alexandria, ruled the parishes of Laodicea after Socrates. <span
id="fr_2450"></span>[2451](#fn_2450.md) The occasion of his removal thither
was the affair of Paul. He went on this account to Syria, and was
restrained from returning home by those there who were zealous in divine
things. Among our contemporaries he was a beautiful example of religion,
as is readily seen from the words of Dionysius which we have
quoted. <span id="fr_2451"></span>[2452](#fn_2451.md)

<span id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p24"></span>6. Anatolius <span
id="fr_2452"></span>[2453](#fn_2452.md) was appointed his successor; one
good man, as they say, following another. He also was an Alexandrian by
birth. In learning and skill in Greek philosophy, such as arithmetic and
geometry, astronomy, and dialectics in general, as well as in the theory
of physics, he stood first among the ablest men of our time, and he was
also at the head in rhetorical science. It is reported that for this
reason he was requested by the citizens of Alexandria to establish there
a school of Aristotelian philosophy. <span
id="fr_2453"></span>[2454](#fn_2453.md)

<span id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p27"></span>7. They relate of him many other
eminent deeds during the siege of the Pyrucheium <span
id="fr_2454"></span>[2455](#fn_2454.md) in Alexandria, on account of which
he was especially honored by all those in high office; but I will give
the following only as an example.

<span id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p29"></span>8. They say that bread had failed
the besieged, so that it was more difficult to withstand the famine than
the enemy outside; but he being present provided for them in this
manner. As the other part of the city was allied with the Roman army,
and therefore was not under siege, Anatolius sent for Eusebius,—for he
was still there before his transfer to Syria, and was among those who
were not besieged, and possessed, moreover, a great reputation and a
renowned name which had reached even the Roman general,—and he informed
him of those who were perishing in the siege from famine.

<span id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p30"></span>9. When he learned this he
requested the Roman commander as the greatest possible favor, to grant
safety to deserters from the enemy. Having obtained his request, he
communicated it to Anatolius. As soon as he received the message he
convened the senate of Alexandria, and at first proposed that all should
come to a reconciliation with the Romans. But when he perceived that
they were angered by this advice, he said, “But I do not think you will
oppose me, if I counsel you to send the supernumeraries and those who
are in nowise useful to us, as old women and children and old men,
outside the gates, to go wherever they may please. For why should we
retain for no purpose these who must at any rate soon die? and why
should we destroy with hunger those who are crippled and maimed in body,
when we ought to provide only for men and youth, and to distribute the
necessary bread among those who are needed for the garrison of the
city?”

<span id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p31"></span>10. With such arguments he
persuaded the assembly, and rising first he gave his vote that the
entire multitude, whether of men or women, who were not needful for the
army, should depart from the city, because if they remained and
unnecessarily continued in the city, there would be for them no hope of
safety, but they would perish with famine.

<span id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p32"></span>11. As all the others in the senate
agreed to this, he saved almost all the besieged. He provided that
first, those belonging to the church, and afterwards, of the others in
the city, those of every age should escape, not only the classes
included in the decree, but, under cover of these, a multitude of
others, secretly clothed in women’s garments; and through his management
they went out of the gates by night and escaped to the Roman camp. <span
id="page_319">p. 319</span> <span
id="iii.xii.xxxiii-Page_319"></span>There Eusebius, like a father and
physician, received all of them, wasted away through the long siege, and
restored them by every kind of prudence and care.

<span id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p33"></span>12. The church of Laodicea was
honored by two such pastors in succession, who, in the providence of
God, came after the aforesaid war from Alexandria to that city.

<span id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p34"></span>13. Anatolius did not write very
many works; but in such as have come down to us we can discern his
eloquence and erudition. In these he states particularly his opinions on
the passover. It seems important to give here the following extracts
from them. <span id="fr_2455"></span>[2456](#fn_2455.md)

<span id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p36"></span>14. *From the Paschal Canons of
Anatolius.* “There is then in the first year the new moon of the first
month, which is the beginning of every cycle of nineteen years, <span
id="fr_2456"></span>[2457](#fn_2456.md) on the twenty-sixth day of the
Egyptian Phamenoth; <span id="fr_2457"></span>[2458](#fn_2457.md) but
according to the months of the Macedonians, the twenty-second day of
Dystrus, <span id="fr_2458"></span>[2459](#fn_2458.md) or, as the Romans
would say, the eleventh before the Kalends of April.

<span id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p40"></span>15. On the said twenty-sixth of
Phamenoth, the sun is found not only entered on the first segment, <span
id="fr_2459"></span>[2460](#fn_2459.md) but already passing through the
fourth day in it. They are accustomed to call this segment the first
dodecatomorion, <span id="fr_2460"></span>[2461](#fn_2460.md) and the
equinox, and the beginning of months, and the head of the cycle, and the
starting-point of the planetary circuit. But they call the one preceding
this the last of months, and the twelfth segment, and the final
dodecatomorion, and the end of the planetary circuit. Wherefore we
maintain that those who place the first month in it, and determine by it
the fourteenth of the passover, commit no slight or common blunder.

<span id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p43"></span>16. And this is not an opinion of
our own; but it was known to the Jews of old, even before Christ, and
was carefully observed by them. This may be learned from what is said by
Philo, Josephus, and Musæus; <span id="fr_2461"></span>[2462](#fn_2461.md)
and not only by them, but also by those yet more ancient, the two
Agathobuli, <span id="fr_2462"></span>[2463](#fn_2462.md) surnamed
‘Masters,’ and the famous Aristobulus, <span
id="fr_2463"></span>[2464](#fn_2463.md) who was chosen among the seventy
interpreters of the sacred and divine Hebrew Scriptures <span
id="fr_2464"></span>[2465](#fn_2464.md) by Ptolemy Philadelphus and his
father, and who also dedicated his exegetical books on the law of Moses
to the same kings.

<span id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p48"></span>17. These writers, explaining
questions in regard to the Exodus, say that all alike should sacrifice
the passover offerings after the vernal equinox, in the middle of the
first month. But this occurs while the sun is passing through the first
segment of the solar, or as some of them have styled it, the zodiacal
circle. Aristobulus adds that it is necessary for the feast of the
passover, that not only the sun should pass through the equinoctial
segment, but the moon also.

<span id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p49"></span>18. For as there are two
equinoctial segments, the vernal and the autumnal, directly opposite
each other, and as the day of the passover was appointed on the
fourteenth of the month, beginning with the evening, the moon will hold
a position diametrically opposite the sun, as may be seen in full moons;
and the sun will be in the segment of the vernal equinox, and of
necessity the moon in that of the autumnal.

<span id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p50"></span>19. I know that many other things
have been said by them, some of them probable, and some approaching
absolute demonstration, by which they endeavor to prove that it is
altogether necessary to keep the passover and the feast of unleavened
bread after the equinox. But I refrain from demanding this sort of
demonstration for matters from which the veil of the Mosaic law has been
removed, so that now at <span id="page_320">p. 320</span> <span
id="iii.xii.xxxiii-Page_320"></span>length with uncovered face we
continually behold as in a glass Christ and the teachings and sufferings
of Christ. <span id="fr_2465"></span>[2466](#fn_2465.md) But that with the
Hebrews the first month was near the equinox, the teachings also of the
Book of Enoch show.” <span id="fr_2466"></span>[2467](#fn_2466.md)

<span id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p54"></span>20. The same writer has also left
the Institutes of Arithmetic, in ten books, <span
id="fr_2467"></span>[2468](#fn_2467.md) and other evidences of his
experience and proficiency in divine things.

<span id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p56"></span>21. Theotecnus, <span
id="fr_2468"></span>[2469](#fn_2468.md) bishop of Cæsarea in Palestine,
first ordained him as bishop, designing to make him his successor in his
own parish after his death. And for a short time both of them presided
over the same church. <span id="fr_2469"></span>[2470](#fn_2469.md) But the
synod which was held to consider Paul’s case <span
id="fr_2470"></span>[2471](#fn_2470.md) called him to Antioch, and as he
passed through the city of Laodicea, Eusebius being dead, he was
detained by the brethren there.

<span id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p60"></span>22. And after Anatolius had
departed this life, the last bishop of that parish before the
persecution was Stephen, <span id="fr_2471"></span>[2472](#fn_2471.md) who
was admired by many for his knowledge of philosophy and other Greek
learning. But he was not equally devoted to the divine faith, as the
progress of the persecution manifested; for it showed that he was a
cowardly and unmanly dissembler rather than a true philosopher.

<span id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p62"></span>23. But this did not seriously
injure the church, for Theodotus <span
id="fr_2472"></span>[2473](#fn_2472.md) restored their affairs, being
straightway made bishop of that parish by God himself, the Saviour of
all. He justified by his deeds both his lordly name <span
id="fr_2473"></span>[2474](#fn_2473.md) and his office of bishop. For he
excelled in the medical art for bodies, and in the healing art for
souls. Nor did any other man equal him in kindness, sincerity, sympathy,
and zeal in helping such as needed his aid. He was also greatly devoted
to divine learning. Such an one was he.

<span id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p65"></span>24. In Cæsarea in Palestine,
Agapius <span id="fr_2474"></span>[2475](#fn_2474.md) succeeded Theotecnus,
who had most zealously performed the duties of his episcopate. Him too
we know to have labored diligently, and to have manifested most genuine
providence in his oversight of the people, particularly caring for all
the poor with liberal hand.

<span id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p67"></span>25. In his time we became
acquainted with Pamphilus, <span id="fr_2475"></span>[2476](#fn_2475.md)
that most eloquent man, of truly philosophical life, who was esteemed
worthy of the office of presbyter in that parish. It would be no small
matter to show what sort of a man he was and whence he came. But we have
de<span id="page_321">p. 321</span> <span
id="iii.xii.xxxiii-Page_321"></span>scribed, in our special work
concerning him, <span id="fr_2476"></span>[2477](#fn_2476.md) all the
particulars of his life, and of the school which he established, and the
trials which he endured in many confessions during the persecution, and
the crown of martyrdom with which he was finally honored. But of all
that were there he was indeed the most admirable.

<span id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p70"></span>26. Among those nearest our times,
we have known Pierius, <span id="fr_2477"></span>[2478](#fn_2477.md) of the
presbyters in Alexandria, and Meletius, <span
id="fr_2478"></span>[2479](#fn_2478.md) bishop of the churches in
Pontus,—rarest of men.

<span id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p73"></span>27. The first was distinguished for
his life of extreme poverty and his philosophic learning, and was
exceedingly diligent in the contemplation and exposition of divine
things, and in public discourses in the church. Meletius, whom the
learned called the “honey of Attica,” <span
id="fr_2479"></span>[2480](#fn_2479.md) was a man whom every one would
describe as most accomplished in all kinds of learning; and it would be
impossible to admire sufficiently his rhetorical skill. It might be said
that he possessed this by nature; but who could surpass the excellence
of his great experience and erudition in other respects?

<span id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p75"></span>28. For in all branches of
knowledge had you undertaken to try him even once, you would have said
that he was the most skillful and learned. Moreover, the virtues of his
life were not less remarkable. We observed him well in the time of the
persecution, when for seven full years he was escaping from its fury in
the regions of Palestine.

<span id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p76"></span>29. Zambdas <span
id="fr_2480"></span>[2481](#fn_2480.md) received the episcopate of the
church of Jerusalem after the bishop Hymenæus, whom we mentioned a
little above. <span id="fr_2481"></span>[2482](#fn_2481.md) He died in a
short time, and Hermon, <span id="fr_2482"></span>[2483](#fn_2482.md) the
last before the persecution in our day, succeeded to the apostolic
chair, which has been preserved there until the present time. <span
id="fr_2483"></span>[2484](#fn_2483.md)

<span id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p81"></span>30. In Alexandria, Maximus, <span
id="fr_2484"></span>[2485](#fn_2484.md) who, after the death of
Dionysius, <span id="fr_2485"></span>[2486](#fn_2485.md) had been bishop
for eighteen years, was succeeded by Theonas. <span
id="fr_2486"></span>[2487](#fn_2486.md) In his time Achillas, <span
id="fr_2487"></span>[2488](#fn_2487.md) who had been appointed a pres<span
id="page_322">p. 322</span> <span
id="iii.xii.xxxiii-Page_322"></span>byter in Alexandria at the same time
with Pierius, became celebrated. He was placed over the school of the
sacred faith, <span id="fr_2488"></span>[2489](#fn_2488.md) and exhibited
fruits of philosophy most rare and inferior to none, and conduct
genuinely evangelical.

<span id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p87"></span>31. After Theonas had held the
office for nineteen years, Peter <span
id="fr_2489"></span>[2490](#fn_2489.md) received the episcopate in
Alexandria, and was very eminent among them for twelve entire years. Of
these he governed the church less than three years before the
persecution, and for the remainder of his life he subjected himself to a
more rigid discipline and cared in no secret manner for the general
interest of the churches. On this account he was beheaded in the ninth
year of the persecution, and was adorned with the crown of martyrdom.

<span id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p91"></span>32. Having written out in these
books the account of the successions from the birth of our Saviour to
the destruction of the places of worship,—a period of three hundred and
five years, <span id="fr_2490"></span>[2491](#fn_2490.md) —permit me to
pass on to the contests of those who, in our day, have heroically fought
for religion, and to leave in writing, for the information of posterity,
the extent and the magnitude of those conflicts.

<span id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p5"></span> Jerome’s version of the *Chron.*
agrees with this passage in assigning eight months to the episcopate of
Eutychianus, while the Armenian gives him only two months. The Liberian
catalogue, however, gives eight years eleven months and three days; and
Lipsius accepts these figures as correct, putting his accession on the
fifth of January, 275, and his death on the eighth of December, 283.
Jerome puts his accession in the fifth year of Probus, which is wide of
the mark, the Armenian in the second year, which is also too late by
about two years. Lipsius explains the eight months of the *Church
History* and the *Chron.* as a change, in their original source, of
years to mouths. The present error makes up in part for the error in
chap. 27, where Xystus is given eleven years instead of eleven months.
Eutychianus was not a martyr, but was buried, according to the Liberian
catalogue, in the Catacombs of St. Calixtus, a statement which has been
confirmed by the discovery of a stone bearing his name.

<span id="fn_2438"></span>[317:2439](2010250.htm#fr_2438.md) <span
id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p6"></span> According to the Liberian
catalogue, Caius became bishop on the 17th of December, 283, and held
office for twelve years four months and six (or seven) days, i.e. until
April 22, 296, and these dates are accepted by Lipsius as correct. Both
versions of the *Chron.* agree with the *History* in assigning fifteen
years to Caius’ episcopate, but this error is of a piece with the others
which abound in this period. The report of his martyrdom is fabulous.

<span id="fn_2439"></span>[317:2440](2010250.htm#fr_2439.md) <span
id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p7"></span> According to the Liberian
catalogue, Marcellinus became bishop on the 30th of June, 296, and held
office for eight years three months and twenty-five days, i.e. until the
25th of October, 304, and these dates Lipsius accepts as correct,
although there is considerable uncertainty as to the exact date of his
death. Jerome’s version of the *Chron.* puts his accession in the
twelfth year of Diocletian, which is not far out of the way, but does
not give the duration of his episcopate, nor does Eusebius in his
*History.* The Armenian *Chron.* does not mention Marcellinus at all.
Tradition, although denied by many of the Fathers, says that he proved
wanting in the Diocletian persecution, and this seems to have been a
fact. It is also said that he afterward repented and suffered martyrdom,
but that is only an invention. The expression of Eusebius in this
connection is ambiguous; he simply says he was “overtaken by the
persecution,” which might mean martyrdom, or might mean simply arrest.
The eleven bishops that preceded him from Pontianus to Caius were buried
in the Catacombs of St. Calixtus, but he was buried in those of
Priscilla.

<span id="fn_2440"></span>[317:2441](2010250.htm#fr_2440.md) <span
id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p9"></span> Of Timæus we know nothing, nor can
we fix his dates. The *Chron.* puts his accession in the year of Abr.
2288 (270 <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p9.1"></span>a.d.</span>), and the accession of his
successor, Cyril, in 2297 (279 <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p9.2"></span>a.d.</span>), but the former at least is
certainly far too early. Harnack (*Zeit des Ignatius,* p. 53) concludes
that Cyril must have been bishop as early as 280, and hence neither
Domnus nor Timæus can have held office a great while.

<span id="fn_2441"></span>[317:2442](2010250.htm#fr_2441.md) <span
id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p9.3"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p10"></span> On Domnus, see chap. 30, note 24.

<span id="fn_2442"></span>[317:2443](2010250.htm#fr_2442.md) <span
id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p11"></span> According to Jerome’s *Chron.,*
Cyril became bishop in the year of Abr. 2297, or fourth year of Probus
(279–280 <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p11.1"></span>a.d.</span>); and Harnack accepts this
as at least approximately correct. The same authority puts the accession
of his successor, Tyrannus, in the eighteenth year of Diocletian
(301–302 <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p11.2"></span>a.d.</span>), and just below Eusebius
says that the destruction of the churches (in Diocletian’s persecution)
took place under Tyrannus, not under Cyril. But the *Passio sanctorum
quattuor coronatorum* (see Mason’s *Persecution of Diocletian,* p.
259–271) contains a reference to him which assumes that he was condemned
to the mines, and died there after three years. The condemnation, if a
fact, must have taken place after the second edict of Diocletian (303
<span class="c13"><span id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p11.3"></span>a.d.</span>),
and his death therefore in 306. There is no other authority for this
report, but Harnack considers it in the highest degree probable, and the
indirect way in which Cyril is mentioned certainly argues for its truth.
Neither Eusebius nor Jerome, however, seems to have known anything about
it, and this is very hard to explain. The matter must, in fact, be left
undecided. See Harnack, *Zeit des Ignatius,* p. 53 sq.

<span id="fn_2443"></span>[317:2444](2010250.htm#fr_2443.md) <span
id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p11.4"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p12"></span> This Dorotheus and his
contemporary, Lucian (mentioned below, in Bk. VIII. chap. 13), are the
earliest representatives of the sound critical method of Biblical
exegesis, for which the theological school at Antioch was distinguished,
over against the school of Alexandria, in which the allegorical method
was practiced. From Bk. VIII. chap. 6 we learn that Dorotheus suffered
martyrdom by hanging early in the Diocletian persecution, so that it
must have been from this emperor, and not from Constantine, that he
received his appointment mentioned just below. Diocletian, before he
began to persecute, had a number of Christian officials in his
household, and treated them with considerable favor.

Hebrew was by no means a common thing among the early teachers of the

<span id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p16"></span> According to the first canon of
the Council of Nicæa (see Hefele, *Conciliengeschichte,* I. p. 376),
persons who made themselves eunuchs were not to be allowed to become
clergymen, nor to remain clergymen if already such. But this prohibition
was not to apply to persons who were made eunuchs by physicians or by
their persecutors; and the latter part of the canon confines the
prohibition expressly to those who have purposely performed the act upon
themselves, and hence nothing would have stood in the way of the
advancement of one born a eunuch as Dorotheus was, even had he lived
after the Council of Nicæa, and still less previous to that time. Closs
(followed by Heinichen) is therefore hardly correct in regarding the
fact that Dorotheus held office as an exception to the established order
of things.

<span id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p19"></span> According to Jerome’s *Chron.*
Tyrannus became bishop in the eighteenth year of Diocletian (301–302).
If the account of Cyril’s death accepted by Harnack be taken as correct,
this date is at least a year too early. If Cyril was sent to the mines
in 303 and died in 306, Tyrannus may have become bishop in 303, or not
until 306. According to Theodoret, *H. E.* I. 3, his successor, Vitalis,
is said to have become bishop “after peace had been restored to the
Church,” which seems to imply, though it is not directly said, that
Tyrannus himself lived until that time (i.e. until 311). We know nothing
certainly either about his character or the dates of his episcopate.

<span id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p21"></span> This Eusebius, who is mentioned
with praise by Dionysius of Alexandria, in the epistle quoted in chap.
11, above, was a deacon in the church of Alexandria, who distinguished
himself by his good offices during the persecution of Valerian (<span
class="c13"><span id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p21.1"></span>a.d.</span> 257), as
recorded in that epistle, and also during the revolt and siege of
Alexandria after the death of Valerian (in 262), as recorded in this
chapter. From the account given here we see that he attended the first,
or at least one of the earlier councils of Antioch in which the case of
Paul was discussed (undoubtedly as the representative of Dionysius,
whose age prevented his attending the first one, as mentioned in chap.
27), and the Laodiceans, becoming acquainted with him there, compelled
him to accept the bishopric of their church, at that time vacant. As we
see from the account of Anatolius’ appointment farther on in this
chapter, he died before the meeting of the council which condemned Paul.
We know in regard to him only what is told us in these two chapters. The
name Eusebius was a very common one in the early Church. The *Dict. of
Christ. Biog.* mentions 137 persons of that name belonging to the first
eight centuries.

<span id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p25"></span> Anatolius we are told here was a
man of great distinction both for his learning and for his practical
common sense. It is not said that he held any ecclesiastical office in
Alexandria, but farther on in the chapter we are told that he left that
city after the close of the siege, as Eusebius had done, and that he was
ordained assistant bishop by Theotecnus, bishop of Cæsarea, and was the
latter’s colleague in that church for a short time. When on his way to
(possibly on his return from) the synod of Antioch, which passed
condemnation upon Paul (and at which Theotecnus was also present), he
passed through Laodicea and was prevailed upon to accept the bishopric
of that city, Eusebius, his old friend, being deceased. The way in which
Laodicea got its two bishops is thus somewhat remarkable. The character
of Anatolius is clear from the account which follows. Jerome mentions
him in his *de vir. ill.* chap. 73, and in his *Ep. ad Magnum* (Migne,
No. 70), but adds nothing to Eusebius’ account. Upon his writings, one
of which is quoted in this chapter, see below, notes 21 and 32.

<span id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p28"></span> The Pyrucheium (the <span

Eusebius vary considerably in their spelling, but I have adopted that
form which seems best supported) or Brucheium (as it is called by other
ancient writers and as it is more generally known) was one of the three
districts of Alexandria and was inhabited by the royal family and by the
Greeks. It was the finest and most beautiful quarter of the city, and
contained, besides the royal palaces, many magnificent public buildings.
Comprising, as it did, the citadel as well, it was besieged a number of
times, and it is uncertain which siege is meant in the present case. It
seems to me most likely that we are to think of the time of the revolt
of Æmilian (see above, chap. 11, note 4), in 260 <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p28.2"></span>a.d.</span>, when the Romans under
Theodotus besieged and finally (just how soon we cannot tell, but the
city seems to have been at peace again at least in 264) took the
Brucheium. Valesius and others think of a later siege under Claudius,
but that seems to me too late (see Tillemont, *Hist. des Emp.* III. p.
345 sq.).

(though this is uncertain), and which was first published by Ægidius
Bucherius in his *Doctrina Temporum,* Antwerp, 1634. Ideler (*Chron.*
II. 230) claims that this supposed translation of Anatolius is a work of
the seventh century. But there are the best of reasons for supposing it
an early translation of Anatolius’ genuine work (see Zahn, *Forschungen
zur Gesch. des N. T. Kanons,* III. p. 177–196). The Latin version is
given with the other extant fragments of Anatolius’ works in Migne’s
*Pat. Gr.* X. 209–222, 231–236, and an English translation of the
*Paschal Canons* in the *Ante-Nicene Fathers,* VI. p. 146–151. Upon this
work of Anatolius, see especially the works of Ideler and Zahn referred

<span id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p45"></span> Who the two Agathobuli were we do
not know. In the *Chron.* of Eusebius a philosopher Agathobulus is
mentioned under the third year of Hadrian in connection with Plutarch,
Sextus, and Œnomaus. Valesius therefore suspects that Anatolius is in
error in putting the Agathobuli earlier than Philo and Josephus. I must
confess, however, that the connection in which Eusebius mentions
Agathobulus in his *Chron.* makes it seem to me very improbable that he
can be referring to either of the Agathobuli whom Anatolius mentions,
and that it is much more likely that the latter were two closely related
Jewish writers (perhaps father and son), who lived, as Anatolius says,
before the time of Philo.

<span id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p46"></span> Aristobulus was a well-known
Hellenistic philosopher of Alexandria, who lived in the time of Ptolemy
Philometor in the second century <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p46.1"></span>b.c.</span> He was thoroughly
acquainted with Greek philosophy, and was in many respects the
forerunner of Philo. Anatolius’ statement that he wrote in the time of
Ptolemy Philadelphus, and consequently his report that he was one of the
seventy translators of the Septuagint (on the legend as to its
composition, see Bk. V. chap. 8, note 31) must be looked upon as
certainly an error (see Clement Alex *Strom.* I. 22, Eusebius’ *Præp.
Evang.* IX. 6, and XIII. 12, and his *Chron.,* year of Abr. 1841). He is
mentioned often by Clement of Alexandria, by Origen (*Contra Cels.* IV.
51), and by Eusebius, who in his *Præp. Evang.* (VII. 14 and VIII. 10)
gives two fragments of his work (or works) *On the Mosaic Law.* It is
doubtless to this same work that Anatolius refers in the present
passage. No other fragments of his writings are extant. See especially
Schürer, *Gesch. der Juden im Zeitalter Jesu Christi,* II. p. 760 sq.
See also Bk. VI. chap. 23, note 13, above.

above, Bk. V. chap. 8, note 31. The mythical character of the common
legend in regard to its composition is referred to in that note, and
that the LXX (or at least that part of it which comprises the law) was
already in existence before the time of Aristobulus is clear from the
latter’s words, quoted by Eusebius, *Præp. Evang.* XIII. 12, 1–2
(Heinichen’s ed.).

<span id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p52"></span> The Book of Enoch is one of the

ancient Church, and is quoted in the [Jude
14](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#014.md)<span
id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p52.1"></span> sq. The work disappeared after about
the fifth century, and was supposed to have perished (with the exception
of a few fragments) until in 1773 it was discovered entire in an
Ethiopic Bible, and in 1838 was published in Ethiopic by Lawrence, who
in 1821 had already translated it into English. Dillmann also published
the Ethiopic text in 1851, and in 1853 a German translation with
commentary. Dillmann’s edition of the original entirely supersedes that
of Lawrence, and his translation and commentary still form the standard
work upon the subject. More recently it has been re-translated into
English and discussed by George H. Schodde: *The Book of Enoch,
translated, with Introduction and Notes,* Andover, 1882. The literature
on the book of Enoch is very extensive. See especially Schodde’s work,
the German translation of Dillmann, Schürer’s *Gesch. der Juden,* II. p.
616 sq., and Lipsius’ article, *Enoch, Apocryphal Book of,* in the
*Dict. of Christ. Biog.*

<span id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p53"></span>The teachings of the book to which
Anatolius refers are found in the seventy-second chapter (Schodde’s ed.
p. 179 sq.), which contains a detailed description of the course of the
sun during the various months of the year.

the final council at which Paul was condemned, and which has been
already mentioned in chaps. 29 and 30 (on its date, see chap. 29, note
1). That it is this particular council to which he refers is implied in
the way in which it is spoken of,—as if referring to the well-known
synod, of which so much has been said,—and still further by the fact
that Eusebius, who had attended the first one (see above, §5), and had
then become bishop of Laodicea, was already dead.

<span id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p63"></span> Theodotus, of whom Eusebius speaks
in such high terms in this passage, was bishop of Laodicea for a great
many years, and played a prominent part in the Arian controversy, being
one of the most zealous supporters of the Arian cause (see Theodoret,
*H. E.* I. 5 and V. 7, and Athanasius *de Synodis Arim. et Seleuc.* I.
17). He was present at the Council of Nicæa (Labbe, *Concil.* II. 51),
and took part in the council which deposed Eustathius of Antioch, in 330
(according to Theodoret, *H. E.* I. 21, whose account, though
unreliable, is very likely correct so far as its list of bishops is
concerned; on the council, see also p. 21, above). He was already dead
in the year 341; for his successor, George, was present at the Council
of Antioch (*In Encæniis*), which was held in that year (see Sozomen,
*H. E.* III. 5, and cf. Hefele, *Conciliengesch.* I. p. 502 sq.). We
have no information that he was present at the Council of Tyre, in 335
(as is incorrectly stated by Labbe, who confounds Theodore of Heraclea
with Theodotus; see Theodoret, *H. E.* I. 28). It is, therefore,
possible that he was dead at that time, though his absence of course
does not prove it. According to Socrates, *H. E.* II. 46, and Sozomen,
*H. E.* VI. 25, Theodotus had trouble with the two Apolinarii, father
and son, who resided at Antioch. We do not know the date of the younger
Apolinarius’ birth (the approximate date, 335, given in the article in
the *Dict. of Christ. Biog.* is a gross error), but we can hardly put it
much earlier than 320, and therefore as he was a reader in the church,
according to Socrates (Sozomen calls him only a youth) in the time of
Theodotus, it seems best to put the death of the latter as late as
possible, perhaps well on toward 340. The date of his accession is
unknown to us; but as Eusebius says that he became bishop straightway
after the fall of Stephen, we cannot well put his accession later than
311; so that he held office in all probability some thirty years.
Venables’ article on Theodotus, in the *Dict. of Christ. Biog.* is a
tissue of errors, caused by identifying Theodotus with Theodore of
Heraclea (an error committed by Labbe before him) and with another
Theodotus, present at the Council of Seleucia, in 359 (Athanasius,
*ibid.* I. 12; cf. Hefele, *Conciliengesch.* I. p. 713).

<span id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p66"></span> Of Agapius we know only what
Eusebius tells us in this passage. He was the immediate predecessor of
Eusebius in the church of Cæsarea, and probably survived the
persecution, but not for many years (see above, p. 10 sq.). Eusebius
speaks of him in the past tense, so that he was clearly already dead at
the time this part of the History was written (i.e. probably in 313; see

<span id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p68"></span> Pamphilus, a presbyter of Cæsarea,
was Eusebius’ teacher and most intimate friend, and after his death
Eusebius showed his affection and respect for him by adopting his name,
styling himself Eusebius Pamphili. He pursued his studies in Alexandria
(according to Photius, under Pierius, more probably under Achillas, the
head of the catechetical school there; see below, notes 42 and 53), and
conceived an unbounded admiration for Origen, the great light of that
school, which he never lost. Pamphilus is chiefly celebrated for the
library which he collected at Cæsarea and to which Eusebius owes a large
part of the materials of his history. Jerome also made extensive use of
it. It was especially rich in copies of the Scripture, of commentaries
upon it, and of Origen’s works (see above, p. 38). He wrote very little,
devoting himself chiefly to the study of Scripture, and to the
transcription of <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p68.1"></span>mss.</span> of it and of the works of
Origen. During the last two years of his life, however, while in prison,
he wrote with the assistance of Eusebius *a Defense of Origen* in five
books, to which Eusebius afterward added a sixth (see above, p. 36 sq.).
During the persecution under Maximinus, he was thrown into prison by
Urbanus, prefect of Cæsarea, in 307, and after remaining two years in
close confinement, cheered by the companionship of Eusebius, he was put
to death by Firmilian, the successor of Urbanus, in 309, as recorded
below, in the *Martyrs of Palestine,* chap. 11 (see above, p. 9). The
*Life of Pamphilus* which Eusebius wrote is no longer extant (see above,
p. 28). On Pamphilus, see Jerome, *de vir. ill.* chap. 75, and Photius,
*Cod.* 118. See also the present volume, p. 5–9 *passim.*

<span id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p71"></span> According to Jerome (*de vir.
ill.* 76) Pierius was a presbyter and a teacher in Alexandria under the
emperors Carus and Diocletian, while Theonas was bishop there (see note
51, below), on account of the elegance of his writings was called “the
younger Origen,” was skilled, moreover, in dialectics and rhetoric,
lived an ascetic life, and passed his later years, after the
persecution, in Rome. According to Photius, *Cod.* 118, he was at the
head of the catechetical school of Alexandria, was the teacher of
Pamphilus, and finally suffered martyrdom. Photius may be correct in the
former statements. The last statement is at variance with Jerome’s
distinct report which in the present instance at least is to be
decidedly preferred to that of Photius. The first statement also is
subject to grave doubt, for according to Eusebius (§30, below),
Achillas, who was made presbyter at the same time as Pierius, and who
lived until after the persecution (when he became bishop), was principal
of the school. Eusebius’ statement must be accepted as correct, and in
that case it is difficult to believe the report of Photius, both on
account of Eusebius’ silence in regard to Pierius’ connection with the
school, and also because if Pierius was principal of the school, he must
apparently have given it up while he was still in Alexandria, or must
have left the city earlier than Jerome says. It is more probable that
Photius’ report is false and rests upon a combination of the accounts of
Eusebius and Jerome. If both the first and third statements of Photius
are incorrect, little faith can be placed on the second, which may be
true, or which may be simply a combination of the known fact that
Pamphilus studied in Alexandria with the supposed fact that Pierius was
the principal of the catechetical school while he was there. It is quite
as probable that Pamphilus studied with Achillas. Jerome tells us that a
number of works (*tractatuum*) by Pierius were extant in his day, among
them a long homily on Hosea (cf. also Jerome’s *Comment. in Osee,
prologus*). In his second epistle to Pammachius (Migne, No. 49) Jerome
refers also to Pierius’ commentary on First Corinthians, and quotes from
it the words, “In saying this Paul openly preaches celibacy.” Photius,
*Cod.* 119, mentions a work in twelve books, whose title he does not
name, but in which he tells us Pierius had uttered some dangerous
sentiments in regard to the Spirit, pronouncing him inferior to the
Father and the Son. This work contained, according to Photius, a book on
Luke’s Gospel, and another on the passover, and on Hosea. Pierius’
writings are no longer extant. The passages from Jerome’s epistle to
Pammachius and from Photius, *Cod.* 119, are given, with notes, by
Routh, *Rel. Sac.* 2d ed. III. 429 sq., and an English translation in
the *Ante-Nicene Fathers,* VI. p. 157. Pierius was evidently a “younger
Origen” in his theology as well as in his literary character, as we can
gather from Photius’ account of him (cf. Harnack’s *Dogmengesch.* I. p.
640).

<span id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p72"></span> A Meletius, bishop of
Sabastopolis, is mentioned by Philostorgius (*H. E.* I. 8) as in
attendance upon the Council of Nicæa, and it is commonly assumed that
this is the same one referred to here by Eusebius. But Eusebius’ words
seem to me to imply clearly that the Meletius of whom he speaks was
already dead at the time he wrote; and, therefore, if we suppose that
Philostorgius is referring to the same man, we must conclude that he was
mistaken in his statement, possibly confounding him with the later
Meletius of Sebaste, afterwards of Antioch. Our Meletius is, however,
doubtless to be identified with the orthodox Meletius mentioned in terms
of praise by Athanasius, in his *Ep. ad Episc. Æg.* §8, and by Basil in
his *De Spir. Sanct.* chap. 29, §74. It is suggested by Stroth that
Eusebius was a pupil of Meletius during the time that the latter was in
Palestine, but this is not implied in Eusebius’ words (see above, p. 5).

know nothing about this bishop, except what is told us here and in the
*Chron.,* where he is called the thirty-eighth bishop (Jerome calls him
the thirty-seventh, but incorrectly according to his own list), and is
said to have entered upon his office in the fifteenth year of Diocletian
(Armen. fourteenth), i.e. in 298. Hermon succeeded him three years
later, according to Jerome; two years later, according to the Armenian
version.

<span id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p79"></span> According to Jerome’s version of

<span class="c13"><span id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p79.1"></span>a.d.</span>
301; according to the Armenian, in the sixteenth year. The accession of
his successor Macharius is put by Jerome in the eighth year of
Constantine, <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p79.2"></span>a.d.</span> 312. Eusebius’ words seem
to imply that Hermon was still bishop at the time he was writing, though
it is not certain that he means to say that. Jerome’s date may be
incorrect, but is probably not far out of the way. Of Hermon himself we
know nothing more.

<span id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p84"></span> According to Jerome’s *Chron.,*
Theonas became bishop in the sixth year of Probus (281 <span
class="c13"><span id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p84.1"></span>a.d.</span>);
according to the Armenian, in the first year of Numerian and Carinus,
i.e. a year later. Both agree with the *History* in assigning nineteen
years to his episcopate. An interesting and admirable epistle is extant
addressed to Lucian, the chief chamberlain of the emperor, and
containing advice in regard to the duties of his position, which is
commonly and without doubt correctly ascribed to Theonas. The name of
the emperor is not given, but all of the circumstances point to
Diocletian, who had a number of Christians in influential positions in
his household during the earlier years of his reign. The epistle, which
is in Latin (according to some a translation of a Greek original), is
given by Routh, *Rel. Sac.* III. 439–445, and an English translation is
contained in the *Ante-Nicene Fathers,* VI. p. 158–161.

<span id="fn_2487"></span>[321:2488](2010250.htm#fr_2487.md) <span
id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p84.2"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p85"></span> The character given to Achillas by
Eusebius is confirmed by Athanasius, who calls him “the great Achillas”
(in his *Epistle to the Bishops of Egypt,* §23). He succeeded Peter as
bishop of Alexandria (Epiphanius makes him the successor of Alexander,
but wrongly, for the testimony of Athanasius, to say nothing of Jerome,
Socrates, and other writers, is decisive on this point; see Athanasius’
*Apology against the Arians,* §§11 and 59, and *Epist. to the Bishops of
Egypt,* §23), but our authorities differ as to the date of his accession
and the length of his episcopate. Eusebius, in this chapter, §31, puts
the death of Peter in the ninth year of the persecution 311–312), and
with this Jerome agrees in his *Chron.,* and there can be no doubt as to
the correctness of the report. But afterwards, quite inconsistently
(unless it be supposed that Achillas became bishop before Peter’s death,
which, in the face of Eusebius’ silence on the subject, is very
improbable), Jerome puts the accession of Achillas into the fifth year
of Constantine, <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p85.1"></span>a.d.</span> 309. Jerome commits another
error in putting the accession of his successor, Alexander, in the
sixteenth year of Constantine (<span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p85.2"></span>a.d.</span> 320); for Alexander’s
controversy with Arius (see above, p. 11 sq.) can hardly have broken out
later than 318 or 319, and it would appear that Alexander had been
bishop already some time when that took place. Theodoret (*H. E.* I. 2)
states that Achillas ruled the church but a short time, and with him
agrees Epiphanius (*Hær.* LXIX. 11), who says that he held office but
three months. The casual way in which Achillas is spoken of in all our
sources, most of which mention him only in passing from Peter to
Alexander, would seem to confirm Theodoret’s report, and Alexander’s
accession may, therefore, be put not long after 311.

<span id="fn_2488"></span>[322:2489](2010250.htm#fr_2488.md) <span
id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p85.3"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p86"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p86.1"></span>τῆς ἱερᾶς πίστεως τὸ
διδασκαλεῖον</span>. Eusebius refers here to the famous catechetical
school of Alexandria (upon which, see above, Bk. V. chap. 10, note 2).
The appointment of Achillas to the principalship of this school would
seem to exclude Pierius, who is said by Photius to have been at the head
of it (see above, note 42).

<span id="fn_2489"></span>[322:2490](2010250.htm#fr_2489.md) <span
id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p87.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p88"></span> Peter is mentioned again in Bk.
VIII. chap. 13, and in Bk. IX. chap. 6, and both times in the highest
terms. In the latter passage his death is said to have taken place by
order of Maximinus, quite unexpectedly and without any reason. This was
in the ninth year of the persecution, as we learn from the present
passage (i.e. Feb. 311 to Feb. 312, or according to Eusebius own
reckoning, Mar. or Apr. 311 to Mar. or Apr. 312; see below Bk. VII.
chap. 2, note o), and evidently after the publication of the toleration
edict of Galerius, when the Christians were not looking for any further
molestation (see below, Bk. VIII. chap. 14, note 2). According to this
passage, Peter was bishop less than three years before the outbreak of
the persecution, and hence he cannot have become bishop before the
spring of 300. On the other hand since he died as early as the spring of
312, and was bishop twelve years he must have become bishop not later
than the spring of 300, and he must have died not long before the spring
of 312, and even then, if Eusebius’ other statements are exact, it is
impossible to make his episcopate fully twelve years in length. The date
thus obtained for his accession is in accord with the dates given for
the episcopate of his predecessor Theonas (see above, note 51). Jerome
puts his accession in the nineteenth year of Diocletian (<span
class="c13"><span id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p88.1"></span>a.d.</span> 302), but
this is at variance with his own figures in connection with Theonas, and
is plainly incorrect.

<span id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p89"></span>Fourteen *Canons,* containing
detailed directions in regard to the lapsed were drawn up by Peter in
306 (see the opening sentence of the first canon), and are still extant.
They are published in all collections of canons and also in numerous
other works. See especially Routh’s *Rel. Sac.* IV. p. 23 sq. An English
translation is given in the *Ante-Nicene Fathers,* VI. p. 269–278. Brief
fragments of other works—*On the Passover, On the Godhead, On the Advent
of the Saviour, On the Soul,* and the beginning of an epistle addressed
to the Alexandrians—are given by Routh, *ibid.* p. 45 sq. These
fragments, together with a few others of doubtful origin, given by
Gallandius and Mai, are translated in the *Ante-Nicene Fathers, ibid.*
p. 280–283. In the same volume (p. 261–268) are given *The Genuine Acts
of Peter,* containing an account of his life and martyrdom. These,
however, are spurious and historically quite worthless.

<span id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p90"></span>Peter seems, to judge from the
extant fragments, to have been in the main an Origenist, but to have
departed in some important respects from the teachings of Origen,
especially on the subject of anthropology (cf. Harnack’s *Dogmengesch.*
I. p. 644). The famous Meletian schism took its rise during the
episcopate of Peter (see Athanasius, *Apology against the Arians,* §59).

id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p91.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.xxxiii-p92"></span> Diocletian’s edict decreeing the
demolition of the churches was published in February, 303. See Bk. VIII.
chap. 2, note 3.
