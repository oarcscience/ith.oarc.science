respect for the memory of him who had been honored by God. The second of
his sons, however, who had by this time arrived, proceeded to celebrate
his father’s funeral in the city which bears his name, himself heading
the procession, which was preceded by detachments of soldiers in
military array, and followed by vast multitudes, the body itself being
surrounded by companies of spearmen and heavy armed infantry. On the
arrival of the procession at the church dedicated to the apostles of our
Saviour, the coffin was there entombed. Such honor did the youthful
emperor Constantius render to his deceased parent, both by his presence,
and by the due performance of this sacred ceremony.
