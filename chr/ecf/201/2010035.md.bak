<span id="iii.vi.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.vi.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—</span>*The Cruelty of Herod
toward the Infants, and the Manner of his Death.*

<span id="iii.vi.viii-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.vi.viii-p2.1"></span>When</span> Christ was born, according to
the prophecies, in Bethlehem of Judea, at the time indicated, Herod was
not a little disturbed by the enquiry of the magi who came from the
east, asking where he who was born King of the Jews was to be found,—for
they had seen his star, and this was their reason for taking so long a
journey; for they earnestly desired to worship the infant as God, <span
id="fr_143"></span>[144](#fn_143.md) —for he imagined that his kingdom
might be endangered; and he enquired therefore of the doctors of the
law, who belonged to the Jewish nation, where they expected Christ to be
born. When he learned that the prophecy of Micah <span
id="fr_144"></span>[145](#fn_144.md) announced that Bethlehem was to be his
birthplace he commanded, in a single edict, all the male infants in
Bethlehem, and all its borders, that were two years of age or less,
according to the time which he had accurately ascertained from the magi,
to be slain, supposing that Jesus, as was indeed likely, would share the
same fate as the others of his own age.

<span id="iii.vi.viii-p5"></span>2. But the child anticipated the snare,
being carried into Egypt by his parents, who had learned from an angel
that appeared unto them what was about to happen. These things are
recorded by the Holy Scriptures in the Gospel. <span
id="fr_145"></span>[146](#fn_145.md)

<span id="iii.vi.viii-p7"></span>3. It is worth while, in addition to
this, to observe the reward which Herod received for his daring crime
against Christ and those of the same age. For immediately, without the
least delay, the divine vengeance overtook him while he was still alive,
and gave him a foretaste of what he was to receive after death.

<span id="iii.vi.viii-p8"></span>4. It is not possible to relate here
how he tarnished the supposed felicity of his reign by successive
calamities in his family, by the murder of wife and children, and others
of his nearest relatives and dearest friends. <span
id="fr_146"></span>[147](#fn_146.md) The account, which casts every other
tragic drama into the shade, is detailed at length in the histories of
Josephus. <span id="fr_147"></span>[148](#fn_147.md)

<span id="iii.vi.viii-p11"></span>5. How, immediately after his crime
against our Saviour and the other infants, the punishment sent by God
drove him on to his death, we can best learn from the words of that
historian who, in the seventeenth book of his Antiquities of the Jews,
writes as follows concerning his end: <span
id="fr_148"></span>[149](#fn_148.md)

<span id="iii.vi.viii-p13"></span>6. “But the disease of Herod grew more
severe, God inflicting punishment for his crimes. For a slow fire burned
in him which was not so apparent to those who touched him, but augmented
his internal distress; for he had a terrible desire for food which it
was not possible to resist. He was affected also with ulceration of the
intestines, and with especially severe pains in the colon, while a
watery and transparent humor settled about his feet.

<span id="iii.vi.viii-p14"></span>7. He suffered also from a similar
trouble in his abdomen. Nay more, his privy member was putrefied and
produced worms. He found also excessive difficulty in breathing, and it
was particularly disagreeable because of the offensive<span
id="page_95">p. 95</span> <span id="iii.vi.viii-Page_95"></span>ness of
the odor and the rapidity of respiration.

<span id="iii.vi.viii-p15"></span>8. He had convulsions also in every
limb, which gave him uncontrollable strength. It was said, indeed, by
those who possessed the power of divination and wisdom to explain such
events, that God had inflicted this punishment upon the King on account
of his great impiety.”

<span id="iii.vi.viii-p16"></span>9. The writer mentioned above recounts
these things in the work referred to. And in the second book of his
History he gives a similar account of the same Herod, which runs as
follows: <span id="fr_149"></span>[150](#fn_149.md) “The disease then
seized upon his whole body and distracted it by various torments. For he
had a slow fever, and the itching of the skin of his whole body was
insupportable. He suffered also from continuous pains in his colon, and
there were swellings on his feet like those of a person suffering from
dropsy, while his abdomen was inflamed and his privy member so putrefied
as to produce worms. Besides this he could breathe only in an upright
posture, and then only with difficulty, and he had convulsions in all
his limbs, so that the diviners said that his diseases were a
punishment. <span id="fr_150"></span>[151](#fn_150.md)

<span id="iii.vi.viii-p20"></span>10. But he, although wrestling with
such sufferings, nevertheless clung to life and hoped for safety, and
devised methods of cure. For instance, crossing over Jordan he used the
warm baths at Callirhoë, <span id="fr_151"></span>[152](#fn_151.md) which
flow into the Lake Asphaltites, <span id="fr_152"></span>[153](#fn_152.md)
but are themselves sweet enough to drink.

<span id="iii.vi.viii-p23"></span>11. His physicians here thought that
they could warm his whole body again by means of heated oil. But when
they had let him down into a tub filled with oil, his eyes became weak
and turned up like the eyes of a dead person. But when his attendants
raised an outcry, he recovered at the noise; but finally, despairing of
a cure, he commanded about fifty drachms to be distributed among the
soldiers, and great sums to be given to his generals and friends.

<span id="iii.vi.viii-p24"></span>12. Then returning he came to Jericho,
where, being seized with melancholy, he planned to commit an impious
deed, as if challenging death itself. For, collecting from every town
the most illustrious men of all Judea, he commanded that they be shut up
in the so-called hippodrome.

<span id="iii.vi.viii-p25"></span>13. And having summoned Salome, <span
id="fr_153"></span>[154](#fn_153.md) his sister, and her husband,
Alexander, <span id="fr_154"></span>[155](#fn_154.md) he said: ‘I know that
the Jews will rejoice at my death. But I may be lamented by others and
have a splendid funeral if you are willing to perform my commands. When
I shall expire surround these men, who are now under guard, as quickly
as possible with soldiers, and slay them, in order that all Judea and
every house may weep for me even against their will.’” <span
id="fr_155"></span>[156](#fn_155.md)

<span id="iii.vi.viii-p29"></span>14. And after a little Josephus says,
“And again he was so tortured by want of food and by a convulsive cough
that, overcome by his pains, he planned to anticipate his fate. Taking
an apple he asked also for a knife, for he was accustomed to cut apples
and eat them. Then looking round to see that there was no one to hinder,
he raised his right hand as if to stab himself.” <span
id="fr_156"></span>[157](#fn_156.md)

<span id="iii.vi.viii-p31"></span>15. In addition to these things the
same writer records that he slew another of his own sons <span
id="fr_157"></span>[158](#fn_157.md) before his death, the third one slain
by his command, and that immediately afterward he breathed his last, not
without excessive pain.

<span id="iii.vi.viii-p33"></span>16. Such was the end of Herod, who
suffered a just punishment for his slaughter of the children of
Bethlehem, <span id="fr_158"></span>[159](#fn_158.md) which was the result
of his plots against our Saviour.

<span id="iii.vi.viii-p35"></span>17. After this an angel appeared in a
dream to Joseph in Egypt and commanded him to go to Judea with the child
and its mother, revealing to him that those who had sought the life of
the child were dead. <span id="fr_159"></span>[160](#fn_159.md) To this the
evangelist adds, “But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in the room
of his father Herod he was afraid to go thither; notwithstanding being
warned of God in a dream he turned aside into the parts of
Galilee.” <span id="fr_160"></span>[161](#fn_160.md)

<span id="iii.vi.viii-p9"></span> Herod’s reign was very successful and
prosperous, and for most of the time entirely undisturbed by external
troubles; but his domestic life was embittered by a constant succession
of tragedies resulting from the mutual jealousies of his wives (of whom
he had ten) and of their children. Early in his reign he slew Hyrcanus,
the grandfather of his best-loved wife Mariamne, upon suspicion of
treason; a little later, Mariamne herself was put to death; in 6 <span
class="c13"><span id="iii.vi.viii-p9.1"></span>b.c.</span> her sons,
Alexander and Aristobulus, were condemned and executed; and in 4 <span
class="c13"><span id="iii.vi.viii-p9.2"></span>b.c.</span>, but a few
days before his death, Antipater, his eldest son, who had been
instrumental in the condemnation of Alexander and Aristobulus, was also
slain by his orders. These murders were accompanied by many others of
friends and kindred, who were constantly falling under suspicion of
treason.

<span id="iii.vi.viii-p18"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vi.viii-p18.1"></span>ποινὴν εἰναι τὰ νοσήματα λέγειν</span>.
Josephus, according to the text of Hudson, reads <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.vi.viii-p18.2"></span>ποινὴν εἶναι τῶν
σοφιστῶν τὰ νοσήματα λέγειν</span>, which is translated by Traill,
“pronounced his maladies a judgment for his treatment of the Sophists.”
Nicephorus (*H. E.* I. 15) agrees with Eusebius in omitting the words
<span class="Greek"><span id="iii.vi.viii-p18.3"></span>τῶν
σοφιστῶν</span>, but he is not an independent witness. Whether Hudson’s
text is supported at this point by strong <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.vi.viii-p18.4"></span>ms.</span> authority I do not know. If the
words stood in the original of Josephus, we may suppose that they were
accidentally omitted by Eusebius himself or by one of his copyists, or
that they were thrown out in order to make Josephus’ statement better
correspond with his own words in *Ant.* XVII. 6, quoted just above,
where his disease is said to have been a result of his impiety in
general, not of any particular exhibition of it.

<span id="iii.vi.viii-p19"></span>On the other hand, the omission of the
words in *Ant.* XVII. 6 casts at least a suspicion on their genuineness,
and if we were to assume that the words did not occur in the original
text of Josephus, it would be very easy to understand their insertion by
some copyist, for in the previous paragraph the historian has been
speaking of the Sophists, and of Herod’s cruel treatment of them.

<span id="fn_151"></span>[95:152](2010035.htm#fr_151.md) <span

<span id="iii.vi.viii-p21"></span> Callirhoë was a town just east of the
Dead Sea.

<span id="fn_152"></span>[95:153](2010035.htm#fr_152.md) <span
id="iii.vi.viii-p21.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.viii-p22"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vi.viii-p22.1"></span>τὴν ᾽Ασφαλτῖτιν λίμνην</span>. This is the
name by which Josephus commonly designates the Dead Sea. The same name
occurs also in Diodorus Siculus (II. 48, XIX. 98).

<span id="fn_153"></span>[95:154](2010035.htm#fr_153.md) <span
id="iii.vi.viii-p25.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.viii-p26"></span> Salome was own sister of Herod the
Great, and wife in succession of Joseph, Costabarus, and Alexas. She
possessed all the cruelty of Herod himself and was the cause, through
her jealousy and envy, of most of the terrible tragedies in his family.

<span id="fn_154"></span>[95:155](2010035.htm#fr_154.md) <span
id="iii.vi.viii-p26.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.viii-p27"></span> Alexander, the third husband of
Salome, is always called Alexas by Josephus.

<span id="fn_155"></span>[95:156](2010035.htm#fr_155.md) <span
id="iii.vi.viii-p27.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.viii-p28"></span> *B. J.*I. 13. 6 (cf. *Ant.* XVII. 6.
5). This terrible story rests upon the authority of Josephus alone, but
is so in keeping with Herod’s character that we have no reason to doubt
its truth. The commands of Herod, however, were not carried out, the
condemned men being released after his death by Salome (see *ibid.* §8).

<span id="fn_156"></span>[95:157](2010035.htm#fr_156.md) <span
id="iii.vi.viii-p29.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.viii-p30"></span> *B. J.*I. 33. 7 (cf. *Ant.* XVII. 7).
Herod’s suicide was prevented by his cousin Achiabus, as Josephus
informs us in the same connection.

<span id="fn_157"></span>[95:158](2010035.htm#fr_157.md) <span
id="iii.vi.viii-p31.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.viii-p32"></span> *B. J.*I. 33. 7 and 8 (cf. *Ant.*
XVII. 7). Antipater, son of Herod and his first wife Doris, was intended
by his father to be his successor in the kingdom. He was beheaded five
days before the death of Herod, for plotting against his father. He
richly deserved his fate.

<span id="fn_158"></span>[95:159](2010035.htm#fr_158.md) <span
id="iii.vi.viii-p33.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.viii-p34"></span> Eusebius gives here the traditional
Christian interpretation of the cause of Herod’s sufferings. Josephus
nowhere mentions the slaughter of the innocents; whether through
ignorance, or because of the insignificance of the tragedy when compared
with the other bloody acts of Herod’s reign, we do not know.
