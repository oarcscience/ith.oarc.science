Symmachus.* <span id="fr_1893"></span>[1894](#fn_1893)

<span id="iii.xi.xvii-p3"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xi.xvii-p3.1"></span>As</span> to these translators it should be
stated that Symmachus was an Ebionite. But the heresy of the Ebionites,
as it is called, asserts that Christ was the son of Joseph and Mary,
considering him a mere man, and insists strongly on keeping the law in a
Jewish manner, as we have seen already in this history. <span
id="fr_1894"></span>[1895](#fn_1894) Commentaries of Symmachus are still
extant in which he appears to support this heresy by attacking the
Gospel of Matthew. <span id="fr_1895"></span>[1896](#fn_1895) Origen
states that he obtained these and other commentaries of Symmachus on the
Scriptures from a certain Juliana, <span
id="fr_1896"></span>[1897](#fn_1896) who, he says, received the books by
inheritance from Symmachus himself.

<span id="iii.xi.xvii-p2"></span> On Symmachus, see the previous
chapter, note 4.

<span id="iii.xi.xvii-p4"></span> In Bk. III. chap. 27. For a discussion
of Ebionism, see the notes on that chapter.

<span id="fn_1895"></span>[264:1896](2010187.htm#fr_1895) <span
id="iii.xi.xvii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xi.xvii-p5"></span> On the attitude of the Ebionites
toward the Canonical Gospel of Matthew (to which of course Eusebius here
refers), see *ibid.* note 8. All traces of this work and of Symmachus’
“other interpretations of Scripture” (<span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xi.xvii-p5.1"></span>ἄ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xi.xvii-p5.2"></span>λλων εἰς τὰς γραφὰς ἑρμηνειῶν</span>),
mentioned just below, have vanished. We must not include Symmachus’
translation of the Old Testament in these other works (as has been done
by Huet and others), for there is no hint either in this passage or in
that of Palladius (see next note) of a reference to that version, which
was, like those of Aquila and Theodotion, well known in Origen’s time
(see the previous chapter).

<span id="fn_1896"></span>[264:1897](2010187.htm#fr_1896) <span
id="iii.xi.xvii-p5.3"></span>

<span id="iii.xi.xvii-p6"></span> This Juliana is known to us only from
this passage and from Palladius, *Hist. Laus.* 147. Palladius reports,
on the authority of an entry written by Origen himself, which he says he
found in an ancient book (<span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xi.xvii-p6.1"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xi.xvii-p6.2"></span>ν παλαιοτ€τῳ βιβλί& 251· στιχηρῷ</span>),
that Juliana was a virgin of Cæsarea in Cappadocia, and that she gave
refuge to Origen in the time of some persecution. If this account is to
be relied upon, Origen’s sojourn in the lady’s house is doubtless to be
assigned, with Huet, to the persecution of Maximinus (235–238; see
below, chap. 28, note 2). It must be confessed, however, that in the
face of the absolute silence of Eusebius and others, the story has a
suspicious look.
