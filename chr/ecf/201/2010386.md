Constantine.*

<span id="iv.vi.i.i-p9"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.i-p9.1"></span>Already <span
id="fr_3048"></span>[3049](#fn_3048.md) </span> have all mankind united in
celebrating with joyous festivities the completion of the second and
third decennial period of this great emperor’s reign; already have we
ourselves received him as a triumphant conqueror in the assembly of
God’s ministers, and greeted him with the due meed of praise on the
twentieth anniversary of his reign: <span
id="fr_3049"></span>[3050](#fn_3049.md) and still more recently we have
woven, as it were, garlands of words, wherewith we encircled his sacred
head in his own palace on his thirtieth anniversary. <span
id="fr_3050"></span>[3051](#fn_3050.md)

<span id="iv.vi.i.i-p13"></span>But now, while I desire <span
id="fr_3051"></span>[3052](#fn_3051.md) to give utterance to some of the
customary sentiments, I stand perplexed and doubtful which way to turn,
being wholly lost in wonder at the extraordinary spectacle before me.
For to whatever quarter I direct my view, whether to the east, or to the
west, or over the whole world, or toward heaven itself, everywhere and
always I see the blessed one yet administering the self-same empire. On
earth I behold his sons, like some new reflectors of his brightness,
diffusing everywhere the luster of their father’s character, <span
id="fr_3052"></span>[3053](#fn_3052.md) and himself still living and
powerful, and governing all the affairs of men more completely than ever
before, being multiplied in the succession of his children. They had
indeed had previously the dignity of Cæsars; <span
id="fr_3053"></span>[3054](#fn_3053.md) but now, being invested with his
very self, and graced by his accomplishments, for the excellence of
their piety they are proclaimed by the titles of Sovereign, Augustus,
Worshipful, and Emperor.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_3048"></span>[481:3049](2010386.htm#fr_3048.md) <span
id="iv.vi.i.i-p9.2"></span>

<span id="iv.vi.i.i-p10"></span> Literally “recently” or “not long
since,” and so it is rendered by Tr. 1709, Stroth, Molzberger, Valesius
(“nuper”), and Portesius. Christophorson and Cousin avoid the
awkwardness by circumlocution or simple omission, while our translator
shows his one characteristic excellence of hitting nearly the unliteral
meaning in a way which is hard to improve.

<span id="fn_3049"></span>[481:3050](2010386.htm#fr_3049.md) <span
id="iv.vi.i.i-p10.1"></span>

<span id="iv.vi.i.i-p11"></span> The assembly referred to was the
Council of Nicæa. Constantine’s vicennial celebration was held at
Nicomedia during the session of the Council at Nicæa (July 25),
according to Hieronymus and others, but celebrated again at Rome the
following year. The speech of Eusebius on this occasion is not
preserved. Valesius thinks the one spoken of in the *V. C.* 3. 11, as
delivered in the presence of the council, is the one referred to.

<span id="fn_3050"></span>[481:3051](2010386.htm#fr_3050.md) <span
id="iv.vi.i.i-p11.1"></span>

<span id="iv.vi.i.i-p12"></span> This oration is the one appended by
Eusebius to this *Life of Constantine,* and given in this translation
(cf. *V. C.* 4. 46).

<span id="fn_3051"></span>[481:3052](2010386.htm#fr_3051.md) <span
id="iv.vi.i.i-p13.1"></span>

<span id="iv.vi.i.i-p14"></span> \[In the text it is <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.vi.i.i-p14.1"></span>ὁ</span> <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.vi.i.i-p14.2"></span>λόγος</span>, “my power
of speech, or of description, much desires,” and so throughout this
preface: but this kind of personification seems scarcely suited to the
English idiom.—*Bag.*\] This usage of Logos is most interesting. Both he
and his friend, the emperor, are fond of dwelling on the circles of
philosophical thought which center about the word Logos (cf. the Oration
of Constantine, and especially the Vicennial Oration of Eusebius). “My
Logos desires” seems to take the place in ancient philosophical slang
which “personality” or “self” does in modern. In ancient usage the word
includes “both the ratio and the oratio” (Liddell and Scott), both the
thought and its expression, both reasoning and saying,—the “internal”
and “expressed” of the Stoics, followed by Philo and early Christian
theology. He seems to use it in the combined sense, and it makes a
pretty good equivalent for “personality,” “my personality desires,” &c.
The idiom is kept up through the chapter.

<span id="fn_3052"></span>[481:3053](2010386.htm#fr_3052.md) <span

<span id="iv.vi.i.i-p15"></span> Constantine II., Constantius, and
Constans proved on the whole sorry reflectors of glory.

<span id="fn_3053"></span>[481:3054](2010386.htm#fr_3053.md) <span
id="iv.vi.i.i-p15.1"></span>

<span id="iv.vi.i.i-p16"></span> The first had been Cæsar more than
twenty years; the second, ten; and the third, less than five.
