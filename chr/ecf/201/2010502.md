id="iv.vi.ii.lvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter LVII</span>.—*He gives Glory to
God, who has given Light by his Son to those who were in Error.*

<span id="iv.vi.ii.lvii-p2"></span>“<span class="c13"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.lvii-p2.1"></span>And</span> truly our worship is no new or
recent thing, but one which thou hast ordained for thine own due honor,
from the time when, as we believe, this system of the universe was first
established. And, although mankind have deeply fallen, and have been
seduced by manifold errors, yet hast thou revealed a pure light in the
person of thy Son, that the power of evil should not utterly prevail,
and hast thus given testimony to all men concerning thyself.
