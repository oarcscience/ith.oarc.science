<span id="iii.xiii.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xiii.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII.—</span>*Many Others, both
Men and Women, who suffered in Various Ways.*

<span id="iii.xiii.xiii-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xiii.xiii-p2.1"></span>Why</span> need we mention the rest by
name, or number the multitude of the men, or picture the various
sufferings of the admirable martyrs of Christ? Some of them were slain
with the axe, as in Arabia. The limbs of some were broken, as in
Cappadocia. Some, raised on high by the feet, with their heads down,
while a gentle fire burned beneath them, were suffocated by the smoke
which arose from the burning wood, as was done in Mesopotamia. Others
were mutilated by cutting off their noses and ears and hands, and
cutting to pieces the other members and parts of their bodies, as in
Alexandria. <span id="fr_2550"></span>[2551](#fn_2550.md)

<span id="iii.xiii.xiii-p4"></span>2. Why need we revive the
recollection of those in Antioch who were roasted on grates, not so as
to kill them, but so as to subject them to a lingering punishment? Or of
others who preferred to thrust their right hand into the fire rather
than touch the impious sacrifice? Some, shrinking from the trial, rather
than be taken and fall into the hands of their enemies, threw themselves
from lofty houses, considering death preferable to the cruelty of the
impious.

<span id="iii.xiii.xiii-p5"></span>3. A certain holy person,—in soul
admirable for virtue, in body a woman,—who was illustrious beyond all in
Antioch for wealth and family and reputation, had brought up in the
principles of religion her two daughters, who were now in the freshness
and bloom of life. Since great envy was excited on their account, every
means was used to find them in their concealment; and when it was
ascertained that they were away, they were summoned deceitfully to
Antioch. Thus they were caught in the nets of the soldiers. When the
woman saw herself and her daughters thus helpless, and knew the things
terrible to speak of that men would do to them,—and the most unbearable
of all terrible things, the threatened violation of their
chastity, <span id="fr_2551"></span>[2552](#fn_2551.md) —she exhorted
herself and the maidens that they ought not to submit even to hear of
this. For, she said, that to surrender their souls to the slavery of
demons was worse than all deaths and destruction; and she set before
them the only deliverance from all these things,—escape to Christ.

<span id="iii.xiii.xiii-p7"></span>4. They then listened to her advice.
And after arranging their garments suitably, they went aside from the
middle of the road, having requested of the guards a little time for
retirement, and cast themselves into a river which was flowing <span
id="page_333">p. 333</span> <span id="iii.xiii.xiii-Page_333"></span>by.

<span id="iii.xiii.xiii-p8"></span>5. Thus they destroyed
themselves. <span id="fr_2552"></span>[2553](#fn_2552.md) But there were
two other virgins in the same city of Antioch who served God in all
things, and were true sisters, illustrious in family and distinguished
in life, young and blooming, serious in mind, pious in deportment, and
admirable for zeal. As if the earth could not bear such excellence, the
worshipers of demons commanded to cast them into the sea. And this was
done to them.

<span id="iii.xiii.xiii-p10"></span>6. In Pontus, others endured
sufferings horrible to hear. Their fingers were pierced with sharp reeds
under their nails. Melted lead, bubbling and boiling with the heat, was
poured down the backs of others, and they were roasted in the most
sensitive parts of the body.

<span id="iii.xiii.xiii-p11"></span>7. Others endured on their bowels
and privy members shameful and inhuman and unmentionable torments, which
the noble and law-observing judges, to show their severity, devised, as
more honorable manifestations of wisdom. And new tortures were
continually invented, as if they were endeavoring, by surpassing one
another, to gain prizes in a contest.

<span id="iii.xiii.xiii-p12"></span>8. But at the close of these
calamities, when finally they could contrive no greater cruelties, and
were weary of putting to death, and were filled and satiated with the
shedding of blood, they turned to what they considered merciful and
humane treatment, so that they seemed to be no longer devising terrible
things against us.

<span id="iii.xiii.xiii-p13"></span>9. For they said that it was not
fitting that the cities should be polluted with the blood of their own
people, or that the government of their rulers, which was kind and mild
toward all, should be defamed through excessive cruelty; but that rather
the beneficence of the humane and royal authority should be extended to
all, and we should no longer be put to death. For the infliction of this
punishment upon us should be stopped in consequence of the humanity of
the rulers.

<span id="iii.xiii.xiii-p14"></span>10. Therefore it was commanded that
our eyes should be put out, and that we should be maimed in one of our
limbs. For such things were humane in their sight, and the lightest of
punishments for us. So that now on account of this kindly treatment
accorded us by the impious, it was impossible to tell the incalculable
number of those whose right eyes had first been cut out with the sword,
and then had been cauterized with fire; or who had been disabled in the
left foot by burning the joints, and afterward condemned to the
provincial copper mines, not so much for service as for distress and
hardship. Besides all these, others encountered other trials, which it
is impossible to recount; for their manly endurance surpasses all
description.

<span id="iii.xiii.xiii-p15"></span>11. In these conflicts the noble
martyrs of Christ shone illustrious over the entire world, and
everywhere astonished those who beheld their manliness; and the
evidences of the truly divine and unspeakable power of our Saviour were
made manifest through them. To mention each by name would be a long
task, if not indeed impossible.

<span id="iii.xiii.xiii-p3"></span> The barbarous mutilation of the
Christians which is spoken of here and farther on in the chapter, began,
as we learn from the *Martyrs of Palestine,* in the sixth year of the
persecution (<span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xiii.xiii-p3.1"></span>a.d.</span> 308). The tyrant Maximin
seems to have become alarmed at the number of deaths which the
persecution was causing, and to have hit upon this atrocious expedient
as a no less effectual means of punishment. It was practiced apparently
throughout Maximin’s dominions; we are told of numbers who were treated
in this way, both in Egypt and Palestine (see *Mart. Pal.* chap. 8 sq.).

<span id="fn_2551"></span>[332:2552](2010264.htm#fr_2551.md) <span
id="iii.xiii.xiii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xiii.xiii-p6"></span> This abominable treatment of female
Christians formed a feature of the persecutions both of Maximian and
Maximin, who were alike monsters of licentiousness. It was entirely
foreign to all the principles of Diocletian’s government, and could
never have been allowed by him. It began apparently in Italy under
Maximian, after the publication by him of the Fourth Edict (see *Mart.
Pal.* chap. 3, note 2), and was continued in the East by Maximin, when
he came into power. We have a great many instances given of this kind of
treatment, and in many cases, as in the present, suicide relieved the
victims of the proposed indignity.

<span id="fn_2552"></span>[333:2553](2010264.htm#fr_2552.md) <span
id="iii.xiii.xiii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xiii.xiii-p9"></span> Eusebius evidently approved of these
women’s suicide, and it must be confessed that they had great
provocation. The views of the early Church on the subject of suicide
were in ordinary cases very decided. They condemned it unhesitatingly as
a crime, and thus made a decided advance upon the position held by many
eminent Pagans of that age, especially among the Stoics. In two cases,
however, their opinion of suicide was somewhat uncertain. There existed
in many quarters a feeling of admiration for those who voluntarily
rushed to martyrdom and needlessly sacrificed their lives. The wiser and
steadier minds, however, condemned this practice unhesitatingly (cf. p.
8, above). The second case in connection with which the opinions of the
Fathers were divided, was that which meets us in the present passage.
The majority of them evidently not only justified but commended suicide
in such an extremity. The first Father distinctly to condemn the
practice was Augustine (*[De civ.](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#000.md)<span
id="iii.xiii.xiii-p9.1"></span> Dei.* I. 22–27). He takes strong ground
on the subject, and while admiring the bravery and chastity of the many
famous women that had rescued themselves by taking their own lives, he
denounces their act as sinful under all circumstances, maintaining that
suicide is never anything else than a crime against the law of God. The
view of Augustine has very generally prevailed since his time. Cf.
Leckey’s *History of European Morals,* 3d edition (Appleton, New York),
Vol. II. p. 43 sq.
