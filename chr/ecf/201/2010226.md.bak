hatred toward Novatian, <span id="fr_2197"></span>[2198](#fn_2197.md) who
has sundered the Church and drawn some of the brethren into impiety and
blasphemy, and has introduced impious teaching concerning God, and has
calumniated our most compassionate Lord Jesus Christ as unmerciful. And
besides all this he rejects the <span id="page_297">p. 297</span> <span

confession which precede it, <span id="fr_2199"></span>[2200](#fn_2199.md)
and entirely banishes from them the Holy Ghost, if indeed there was any
hope that he would remain or return to them.” <span

<span id="iii.xii.ix-p3"></span> The majority of the <span
class="c13"><span id="iii.xii.ix-p3.1"></span>mss.</span> have <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.xii.ix-p3.2"></span>Νοουατιανῷ</span>, a few
<span class="Greek"><span id="iii.xii.ix-p3.3"></span>Ναυατιανῷ</span>.
This is the only place in which the name Novatian occurs in Eusebius’
*History,* and here it is used not by Eusebius himself but by Dionysius.
Eusebius, in referring to the same man, always calls him Novatus (see
above, Bk. VI. chap. 43, note 1). Upon Novatian and his schism, see the
same note.

<span id="fn_2198"></span>[297:2199](2010226.htm#fr_2198.md) <span

<span id="iii.xii.ix-p4"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xii.ix-p4.1"></span>λουτρόν</span>. That Novatian re-baptized
all those who came over to him from the Church is stated by Cyprian in
his epistle to Jubaianus, §2 (No. 72, *al.* 73). His principle was
similar to that which later actuated the Donatists, namely, that baptism
is valid only when performed by priests of true and approved Christian
character. Denying, then, that those who defiled themselves and did
despite to God s holy Church by communing with the lapsed were true
Christians, he could not do otherwise than reject their baptism as quite
invalid.

<span id="fn_2199"></span>[297:2200](2010226.htm#fr_2199.md) <span
id="iii.xii.ix-p4.2"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.ix-p5"></span> It was the custom from a very early
period to cause the candidate for baptism to go through a certain course
of training of greater or less length, and to require him to assent to a
formulated statement of belief before the administration of the sacred
rite. Thus we learn from the *Didache* that even as early as the very
beginning of the second century the custom of pre-baptismal training was
already in vogue, and we know that by the third century the system of
catechetical instruction was a highly developed thing, extending
commonly over two to three years. Candidates for baptism were then known
as catechumens. So far as a baptismal creed or confession of faith is
concerned, Caspari (see his great work, *Studien zur Gesch. des
Taufsymbols*) has shown that such a creed was in use in the Roman church
before the middle of the second century, and that it formed the basis of
what we know as the Apostles’ Creed, which in the form in which we have
it is a later development.

<span id="iii.xii.ix-p6"></span>Inasmuch as Novatian, so far as we can
learn, was perfectly orthodox on matters of faith, he would not have
cared to make any alteration in such a creed as the present Apostles’
Creed. Exactly what Dionysius means in the present case is not certain.
It is possible that he is simply speaking in general terms, assuming
that if Novatian does not accept the Church baptism, he must overturn
and pervert with it the instruction which had preceded; or it may be
that he is thinking of that form of confession to which the candidate
was required to give his assent, according to Cyprian, *Ep.* 69 (*al.*
70): *credis in vitam æternam et remissionem peccatorum per sanctam
ecclesiam?* “Dost thou believe in eternal life and remission of sins
through the holy Church?” The latter is the view of Valesius, who is
followed by all others that have discussed the passage so far as I am
aware. Of course Novatian could not put the last clause of this question
to his converts, and hence Dionysius may have been thinking of this
omission in using the words he does. At the same time I confess myself
unable to agree with others in interpreting him thus. In the first
place, it is, to say the least, very doubtful whether the question
quoted above from Cyprian formed an article in the baptismal confession
of the Church in general. It does not appear in the Apostles’ Creed, and
can therefore hardly have formed a part of the earlier Roman formula
which underlay that. And so far as I am aware there are no traces of the
use of such an article in the church of Alexandria. In the second place,
Dionysius’ language seems to me too general to admit of such a
particular application. Had he been thinking of one especial article of
the confession, as omitted or altered by Novatian, he would, in my
opinion, have given some indication of it. I am, therefore, inclined to
take his words in the most general sense, suggested as possible just
above.

<span id="fn_2200"></span>[297:2201](2010226.htm#fr_2200.md) <span
id="iii.xii.ix-p6.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.ix-p7"></span> These last clauses are, according to
Valesius, fraught with difficulty. He interprets the <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.xii.ix-p7.1"></span>αὐτῶν</span> (“entirely
banished from *them*”) as referring to the *lapsi,* and interpreted thus
I find the passage not simply difficult, as he does, but
incomprehensible. But I confess myself again unable to accept his
interpretation. To me the <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xii.ix-p7.2"></span>αὐτῶν</span> seems not to refer to the
*lapsi,* to whom there has been no direct reference in this fragment
quoted by Eusebius, but rather to Novatian’s converts, to whom reference
is made in the previous sentence, and who are evidently in the mind of
the writer in referring to Novatian’s baptism in the first clause of the
present sentence. It seems to me that Dionysius means simply to say that
in rejecting the baptism of the Church, and the “faith and confession
which precede it,” Novatian necessarily drove away from his converts the
Holy Spirit, who works in and through right confession and true baptism.
The meaning of the words “if, indeed, there was any hope,” &c., thus
becomes very clear; Dionysius does not believe, of course, that the Holy
Spirit would remain with those who should leave the Church to go with
Novatian, but even if he should remain, he would be driven entirely away
from them when they blasphemed him and denied his work, by rejecting the
true baptism and submitting to another baptism without the Church.
