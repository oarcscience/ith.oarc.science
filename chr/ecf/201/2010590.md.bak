id="iv.vi.iv.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV</span>.—*His Liberality, from
His Private Resources, to the Losers in Suits of a Pecuniary Nature.*

<span id="iv.vi.iv.iv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.iv-p2.1"></span>In</span> cases of judicial arbitration, in
order that the loser by his decision might not quit his presence less
contented than the victorious litigant, he himself bestowed, and from
his own private means, in some cases lands, in other money, on the
defeated party. In this manner he took care that the loser, as having
appeared in his presence, should be as well satisfied as the gainer of
the cause; for he considered that no one ought in any case to retire
dejected and sorrowful from an interview with such a prince. <span
id="fr_3309"></span>[3310](#fn_3309.md) Thus it happened that both parties
returned from the scene of trial with glad and cheerful countenances,
while the emperor’s noble-minded liberality excited universal
admiration.

<span id="iv.vi.iv.iv-p3"></span> In reality it may have been less
childish than Eusebius makes it appear, for it probably refers to cases
where it was a matter of just equalization of claims, where each party
thought his claim just.
