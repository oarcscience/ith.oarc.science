id="iii.ix.xx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XX.—</span>*The Rulers of the Church
of Antioch.*

<span id="iii.ix.xx-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.ix.xx-p2.1"></span>At</span> that time also in the church of
Antioch, Theophilus <span id="fr_1212"></span>[1213](#fn_1212.md) was well
known as the sixth from the apostles. For Cornelius, <span
id="fr_1213"></span>[1214](#fn_1213.md) who succeeded Hero, <span
id="fr_1214"></span>[1215](#fn_1214.md) was the fourth, and after him
Eros, <span id="fr_1215"></span>[1216](#fn_1215.md) the fifth in order, had
held the office of bishop.

<span id="iii.ix.xx-p4"></span> Of the life and character of Cornelius
and Eros we know nothing. The *Chron.* of Eusebius puts the accession of
Cornelius into the twelfth year of Trajan (128 <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.ix.xx-p4.1"></span>a.d.</span>), and the accession of his
successor Eros into the fifth year of Antoninus Pius (142). These dates,
however, are quite unreliable, and we have no means of correcting them
(see Harnack’s *Zeit des Ignatius,* p. 12 sqq.). Theophilus, the
successor of Eros we have reason to think became bishop about the middle
of Marcus Aurelius’ reign and hence the *Chron.,* which puts his
accession into the ninth year of that reign, (169 <span
class="c13"><span id="iii.ix.xx-p4.2"></span>a.d.</span>) cannot be far
out of the way. This gives us the approximate date for the death of
Eros.
