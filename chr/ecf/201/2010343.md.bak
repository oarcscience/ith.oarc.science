<span id="iv.iii.i.ii-Page_413"></span>§2. *The First Five Years of
Reign.*

<span id="iv.iii.i.ii-p2"></span>The will of the father was promptly
ratified by the soldiers, who at once proclaimed Constantine
Augustus. <span id="fr_3003"></span>[3004](#fn_3003.md) Supported by them,
and also by Erocus, king of the Allemanni (Vict. *Epit.* p. 49–50), he
sent his portrait to Galerius, claiming the title of Augustus. This the
emperor refused to grant, but, much against his will, allowed him to
have the title of Cæsar (Lact. c. 25). Constantine did not insist on his
right to the greater title, but waited his time, and in the interim
contented himself with the lesser,—as the coins show. <span
id="fr_3004"></span>[3005](#fn_3004.md) There was enough to do. After his
father’s death he waged war against the Francs, and later against the
Bructeri and others (Eutrop. 10. 3; *Paneg.* (307) c. 4; Eumen. *Paneg.*
(310) cc. 10–12; Nazar. *Paneg.* (321) 18; Euseb. *V. C.* 1. 25, &c.;
cf. Inscr. ap. Clinton 2. 93), and celebrated his victories by exposing
his captives to the wild beasts (Eutrop. 10. 3; Eumen. *Paneg.* (310) c.
12; *Paneg.* (313) c. 23; cf. Nazar. *Paneg.* (321) c. 16).

<span id="iv.iii.i.ii-p5"></span>Meanwhile affairs were marching at
Rome, too. The same year (306) that Constantine was elected Augustus by
the soldiers, Maxentius at Rome was proclaimed emperor by the Pretorian
Guards (Eutrop. 10. 2; Vict. *Cæs.* p. 156; Anon. Vales. p. 472; Zos. 2.
9; Socr. 1. 2; Oros. c. 26, &c.; Lact. c. 26). He persuaded the willing
(Eutrop. 10. 2) Maximian to resume the imperial purple (Lact. c. 26;
Zos. 2. 10), but soon quarreled with him (Socr. 1. 2; Eutrop. 10. 3;
Zos. 2. 11; Lact. c. 28). <span id="fr_3005"></span>[3006](#fn_3005.md) In
307 Constantine and Maximinus were named “sons of the emperors,” and the
following year were reluctantly acknowledged as emperors by Galerius.
Maximian, after he had quarreled with his son, betook himself to Gaul
and made alliance with Constantine by giving his daughter Fausta in
marriage (307). He proved an uncomfortable relative. The much-abused
mother-in-law of fiction is not to be compared with this choice
father-in-law of history. First he tried to supersede Constantine by
corrupting his soldiers. At his persuasion Constantine had left behind
the bulk of his army while he made a campaign on the frontier. As soon
as he was supposably out of the way, the soldiers were won by largesses,
and Maximian assumed the purple again. But he had reckoned without his
host. Constantine acted with decisive promptness, returned by such rapid
marches that he caught Maximian entirely unprepared (Lact. c. 29) and
drove him into Marseilles, where the latter cursed him vigorously from
the walls (Lact. c. 29), but was able to offer no more tangible
resistance. The gates were thrown open (Lact. c. 29), and Maximian was
in the power of Constantine, who this time spared his precious
father-in-law. <span id="fr_3006"></span>[3007](#fn_3006.md) Grateful for
this mildness, Maximian then plotted to murder him. The plan was for
Fausta to leave her husband’s door open and for Maximian to enter and
kill Constantine with his own hands. Fausta pretended to agree, but told
her husband (Zos. 2. 11; Joh. Ant. p. 603; Oros. c. 28), who put a slave
in his own place (but apparently did not “put himself in the place of”
the slave), had the program been carried out, and catching Maximian in
the act, granted him that supreme ancient mercy,—the right to choose how
he would die (Lact. c. 30). <span id="fr_3007"></span>[3008](#fn_3007.md)

<span id="iv.iii.i.ii-p9"></span>Though in the midst of wars and plots,
and liable at any time to have to run from one end of his province to
the other to put down some insurrection, Constantine kept steadily at
the work of internal improvement, organizing the interior, fortifying
the boundaries, building bridges, restor<span id="page_414">p.
414</span> <span id="iv.iii.i.ii-Page_414"></span>ing cities, building
up educational institutions, &c. <span
id="fr_3008"></span>[3009](#fn_3008.md) At the end of five years’ reign
(July 24, 311) he had reduced the turbulent tribes, organized his
affairs, and endeared himself to his people, especially to the
Christians, whom he had favored from the first (Lact. c. 24), and who
could hardly fail in those days of persecution to rejoice in a policy
such as is indicated in his letter to Maximinus Daza in behalf of
persecuted Christians (Lact, c. 37).

<span id="iv.iii.i.ii-p3"></span> So Eusebius *H. E.* 8. 13; Lact. c.
25; Julian *Orat.* 1. p. 13. Eumenius (*Paneg.* 310, c. 7) says that he
was elected “imperator,” but in cc. 8–9 speaks of him as having become
Cæsar. Eutropius (10. 2) also uses the word “imperator.” Zosimus, on the
other hand (2. 9), and Anonymus Vales. say he was elected “Augustus,”
but was only confirmed “Cæsar” by Galerius (see below). The elevation
was in Britain (cf. Eutrop. 10. 2; Eumen. *Paneg.* (310) c. 9; Soz. 1.
5, &c.).

<span id="fn_3004"></span>[413:3005](2010343.htm#fr_3004.md) <span
id="iv.iii.i.ii-p3.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.i.ii-p4"></span> See coins in Eckhel 8, p. 72, under
the year. It is also expressly stated by *Paneg.* (307) c. 5.

<span id="fn_3005"></span>[413:3006](2010343.htm#fr_3005.md) <span
id="iv.iii.i.ii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.i.ii-p6"></span> It is said by many that the quarrel
was a feigned one, and that it was wholly for the purpose of getting rid
of Constantine in behalf of Maxentius that he betook himself to Gaul.
That he went to Gaul with this purpose, at least, is mentioned by many
(cf. Lact. c. 29; Oros. c. 28; Eutrop. 10. 2, “on a planned stratagem”).
It seems curious, if he had attempted to supersede Maxentius by raising
a mutiny (Eutrop. 10. 3), that he should now be working for him and
planning to rejoin him (Eutrop. 10. 2), but it is no inconsistency in
this man, who was consistent only in his unceasing effort to destroy
others for his own advantage.

<span id="fn_3006"></span>[413:3007](2010343.htm#fr_3006.md) <span
id="iv.iii.i.ii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.i.ii-p7"></span> Compare on all this Lact. c. 29;
Eumen. *Paneg* c. 14.

<span id="iv.iii.i.ii-p8"></span> Socrates (1. 2) with many others (e.g.
Zos. 2. 11) says he died at Tarsus, confusing him thus with Maximinus.

<span id="fn_3008"></span>[414:3009](2010343.htm#fr_3008.md) <span
id="iv.iii.i.ii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.i.ii-p10"></span> Notably at Autun. The city had been
almost destroyed. Eumenius, whose oration of thanks in behalf of the
people of Autun is extant, praises Constantine as the restorer, almost
the founder. The work had been undertaken by Constantius, indeed, but
was carried on by his son. Constantine’s work of internal improvement
was in many ways distinctly a continuation of the work begun by
Constantius. Compare Eumen. *Paneg.* (especially c. 13, 22, &c.) and
*Grat. act.*
