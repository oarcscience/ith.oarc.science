id="iii.xi.xxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVIII</span>.—*The Persecution
under Maximinus.*

<span id="iii.xi.xxviii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xi.xxviii-p2.1"></span>The</span> Roman emperor, Alexander,
having finished his reign in thirteen years, was succeeded by Maximinus
Cæsar. <span id="fr_2003"></span>[2004](#fn_2003.md) On account of his
hatred toward the household of Alexander, <span
id="fr_2004"></span>[2005](#fn_2004.md) which contained many believers, he
began a persecution, commanding that only the rulers of the churches
should be put to death, as responsible for the Gospel teaching.
Thereupon Origen composed his work On Martyrdom, <span
id="fr_2005"></span>[2006](#fn_2005.md) and dedicated it to Ambrose and
Protoctetus, <span id="fr_2006"></span>[2007](#fn_2006.md) a presbyter of
the parish of Cæsarea, because in the persecution there had come upon
them both unusual hardships, in which it is reported that they were
eminent in confession during the reign of Maximinus, which lasted but
three years. Origen has noted this as the time of the persecution in the
twenty-second book of his Commentaries on John, and in several
epistles. <span id="fr_2007"></span>[2008](#fn_2007.md)

<span id="iii.xi.xxviii-p3"></span> Alexander Severus was murdered early
in the year 235, and was succeeded at once by his commanding general,
the Thracian Maximinus, or Caius Julius Verus Maximinus, as he called
himself.

<span id="fn_2004"></span>[274:2005](2010198.htm#fr_2004.md) <span
id="iii.xi.xxviii-p3.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xi.xxviii-p4"></span> The reference here is not to the
immediate family of Alexander, but to the court as a whole, his family
in the widest sense including court officials, servants, &c. The favor
which Alexander had shown to the Christians (see chap. 21, note 8) is
clearly seen in the fact that there were so many Christians at court, as
Eusebius informs us here. This persecution was at first directed,
Eusebius tells us, solely against the heads of the churches (<span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.xi.xxviii-p4.1"></span>τοὺς τῶν ἐκκλησιῶν
ἄρχοντας</span>), i.e. the bishops; and we might imagine only those
bishops who had stood nearest Alexander and had been most favored by him
to be meant (Pontianus and Hippolytus of Rome were exiled, for instance,
at the very beginning of Maximinus’ reign, in the year 235; see chap.
22, note 1); for Maximinus’ hostility to the Christians seems to have
been caused, not by religious motives, but by mere hatred of his
predecessor, and of every cause to which he had shown favor. But the
persecution was not confined to such persons, as we learn from this
chapter, which tells us of the sufferings of Ambrose and Protoctetus,
neither of whom was a bishop. It seems probable that most of the
persecuting was not the result of positive efforts on the part of
Maximinus, but rather of the superstitious hatred of the common people,
whose fears had been recently aroused by earthquakes and who always
attributed such calamities to the existence of the Christians. Of course
under Maximinus they had free rein, and could persecute whenever they or
the provincial authorities felt inclined (cf. Firmilian’s epistle to
Cyprian, and Origen’s *Exhort. ad Mart.*). Eusebius tells us nothing of
Origen’s whereabouts at this time; but in Palladius’ *Hist. Laus.* 147,
it is said that Origen was given refuge by Juliana in Cæsarea in
Cappadocia during some persecution, undoubtedly this one, if the report
is true (see chap. 17, note 4).

<span id="iii.xi.xxviii-p5"></span> This work on martyrdom (<span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.xi.xxviii-p5.1"></span>εἰς μαρτύριον
προτρεπτικὸς λόγος</span>, *Exhortatio ad Martyrium*) is still extant,
and is printed by Lommatzsch in Vol. XX., p. 231–316. It is a most
beautiful and inspiring exhortation.

<span id="iii.xi.xxviii-p6"></span> On Ambrose, see chap. 18, note 1.
Protoctetus, a presbyter of the church of Cæsarea (apparently
Palestinian Cæsarea), is known to us only from this passage.

<span id="iii.xi.xxviii-p7"></span> On Origen’s Commentary on John’s
Gospel, see chap. 24, note 1. No fragments of the twenty-second book are
extant, nor any of the epistles in which reference is made to this
persecution.
