<span id="iv.vi.ii.xxxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.xxxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXVI</span>.—*The Church is
declared Heir of those who leave no Kindred; and the Free Gifts of such
Persons Confirmed.*

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xxxvi-p2"></span>“<span class="c13"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.xxxvi-p2.1"></span>But</span> should there be no surviving
relation to succeed in due course to the property of those
above-mentioned, I mean the martyrs, or confessors, or those who for
some such cause have been banished from their native land; in such cases
we ordain that the church locally nearest in each instance shall succeed
to the inheritance. And surely it will be no wrong to the departed that
that church should be their heir, for whose sake they have endured every
extremity of suffering. We think it necessary to add this also, that in
case any of the above-mentioned persons have donated any part of their
property in the way of free gift, possession of such property shall be
assured, as is reasonable, to those who have thus received it.
