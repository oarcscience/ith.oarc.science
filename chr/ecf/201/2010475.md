<span id="iv.vi.ii.xxx-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.xxx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXX</span>.—*A Law granting
Release from Exile, from Service in the Courts, and from the
Confiscation of Property.*

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xxx-p2"></span>“<span class="c13"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.xxx-p2.1"></span>Let</span> all therefore who have
exchanged their country for a foreign land, because they would not
abandon that reverence and faith toward God to which they had devoted
themselves with their whole hearts, and have in consequence at different
times been subject to the cruel sentence of the courts; together with
any who have been enrolled in the registers of the public courts though
in time past exempt from such office; let these, I say, now render
thanks to God the Liberator of all, in that they are restored to their
hereditary property, and their wonted tranquility. Let those also who
have been despoiled of their goods, and have hitherto passed a wretched
existence, mourning under the loss of all that they possessed, once more
be restored to their former homes, their families, and estates, and
receive with joy the bountiful kindness of God.
