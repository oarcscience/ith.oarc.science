<span id="iv.vi.i.v-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V</span>.—*That he reigned above
Thirty Years, and lived above Sixty*.

<span id="iv.vi.i.v-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.v-p2.1"></span>With</span> respect to the duration of his
reign, God honored him with three complete periods of ten years, and
something more, extending the whole term of his mortal life to twice
this number of years. <span id="fr_3061"></span>[3062](#fn_3061.md) And
being pleased to make him a representative of his own sovereign power,
he displayed him as the conqueror of the whole race of tyrants, and the
destroyer of those God-defying giants <span
id="fr_3062"></span>[3063](#fn_3062.md) of the earth who madly raised <span
id="page_483">p. 483</span> <span id="iv.vi.i.v-Page_483"></span>their
impious arms against him, the supreme King of all. They appeared, so to
speak, for an instant, and then disappeared: while the one and only true
God, when he had enabled his servant, clad in heavenly panoply, to stand
singly against many foes, and by his means had relieved mankind from the
multitude of the ungodly, constituted him a teacher of his worship to
all nations, to testify with a loud voice in the hearing of all that he
acknowledged the true God, and turned with abhorrence from the error of
them that are no gods.

Refers of course to the mythical Gigantes who fought against the gods.
It is used in the same sense in which Æschylus uses it of Capaneus
(Theb. 424), who defied Zeus in declaring that even his thunderbolts
should not keep him out of Thebes.
