of God, had granted to His worshipers freedom of access to the imperial
palaces; this enemy of God, in a spirit the very reverse of this,
expelled thence all Christians subject to his authority. He banished
those who had proved themselves his most <span id="page_497">p.

servants, and compelled others, on whom he had himself conferred honor
and distinction as a reward for their former eminent services, to the
performance of menial offices as slaves to others; and at length, being

by the continual practice of adultery and other shameless vices, he
assumed his own worthless character as a specimen of human nature
generally, and denied that the virtue of chastity and continence existed
among men.
