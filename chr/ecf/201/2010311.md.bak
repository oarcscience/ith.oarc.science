<span id="iii.xvii.iv"></span>

<span id="iii.xvii.iv-p1"></span> On Bk. III. chap. 25, § 4 (note 18
continued).

<span id="iii.xvii.iv-p2"></span>The words <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xvii.iv-p2.1"></span>ἡ</span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xvii.iv-p2.2"></span>φερομένη Βαρν€βα ἐπιστολή</span> have been
commonly translated “the so-called Epistle of Barnabas,” or “the Epistle
ascribed to Barnabas,” implying a doubt in Eusebius’ mind as to the
authenticity of the work. This translation, however, is, in my opinion,
quite unwarranted. There are passages in Eusebius where the word <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.xvii.iv-p2.3"></span>φέρομαι</span> used in
connection with writings cannot by any possibility be made to bear this
meaning; cases in which it can be interpreted only “to be extant” or “in
circulation.” Compare, for instance, Bk. II. chap. 15, § 1, <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.xvii.iv-p2.4"></span>Μ€ρκον οὗ τὸ εὐγγέλιον
φέρεται</span>; II. 18. 6, <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xvii.iv-p2.5"></span>μονόβιβλα αὐτοῦ φέρεται</span>; III. 9. 4;
III. 16; III. 25. 3, <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xvii.iv-p2.6"></span>ἡ</span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xvii.iv-p2.7"></span>λεγο</span><span id="page_389">p.
389</span> <span id="iii.xvii.iv-Page_389"></span><span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.xvii.iv-p2.8"></span>μένη ᾽Ιακώβου
φέρεται</span>; III. 37. 4; III. 39. 1; IV. 3. 1, <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.xvii.iv-p2.9"></span>εἰσέτι δὲ φέρεται παρὰ
πλείστοις</span>; IV. 14. 9, <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xvii.iv-p2.10"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xvii.iv-p2.11"></span>ν τῇ δηλωθείσῃ πρὸς φιλιππησίους αὐτοῦ
γραφῇ φερομένῃ εἰς δεῦρο</span>. Compare also IV. 15. I; IV. 23. 4, 9,
12; IV. 24. 1; IV. 28; V. 5. 6; 19. 3; 23. 2; 24. 10; VI. 15. 1; VI. 20,
&c. These passages, and many others which are cited by Heinichen (Vol.
III. p. 91), prove that the word is frequently used in the sense of
“extant” or “in circulation.” But in spite of these numerous examples,
Heinichen maintains that the word is also used by Eusebius in another
and quite different sense; namely, “so-called” or “ascribed to,” thus
equivalent to <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xvii.iv-p2.12"></span>λεγομένη</span>. A careful examination,
however, of all the passages cited by him in illustration of this second
meaning will show that in them too the word may be interpreted in the
same way as in those already referred to; in fact, that in many of them
that is in itself the more natural interpretation. The passages to which
we refer are Bk. III. chap. 25, §§ 2, 3, and 4; III. 3. 1, <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.xvii.iv-p2.13"></span>τὴν δὲ φερομένην αὐτοῦ
δευτέραν</span>; III. 39. 6 (where I ought to have translated “is extant
under the name of John”). To draw a distinction between the meaning of
the word as used in these and in the other passages is quite arbitrary,
and therefore unwarranted. The sense in which, as we have found,
Eusebius so commonly employs the word attaches also to the Latin word
*fertur* in the Muratorian Canon. I have not endeavored to trace
carefully the use of the word in other writers; but while many instances
occur in which it is certainly used in this sense, others in which
either interpretation is allowable, I have not yet found one in which
this meaning is ruled out by the nature of the case or by the context.
In view of these facts I believe we should be careful to draw a sharp
distinction between <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xvii.iv-p2.14"></span>λεγομένη</span> or <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.xvii.iv-p2.15"></span>καλουμένη</span> and
<span class="Greek"><span id="iii.xvii.iv-p2.16"></span>φερομένη</span>
when used in connection with written works.

<span id="iii.xvii.iv-p3"></span>A considerable portion of my
translation was in type before I had observed this distinction between
the two words, which is commonly quite overlooked, and as a consequence
in a few cases my rendering of the word <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xvii.iv-p3.1"></span>φερομένη</span> is inaccurate. All such
cases I have endeavored to call attention to in these supplementary
notes.
