<span id="iii.x.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.x.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII.—</span>*Even down to those
Times Miracles were performed by the Faithful.*

<span id="iii.x.viii-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.x.viii-p2.1"></span>These</span> things Irenæus, in agreement
with the accounts already given by us, <span
id="fr_1458"></span>[1459](#fn_1458.md) records in the work which comprises
five books, and to which he gave the title Refutation and Overthrow of
the Knowledge Falsely So-called. <span
id="fr_1459"></span>[1460](#fn_1459.md) In the second book of the same
treatise he shows that manifestations of divine and miraculous power
continued to his time in some of the churches.

<span id="iii.x.viii-p5"></span>2. He says: <span
id="fr_1460"></span>[1461](#fn_1460.md)

<span id="iii.x.viii-p8"></span>“But so far do they come short of
raising the dead, as the Lord raised them, and the apostles through
prayer. And oftentimes in the brotherhood, when, on account of some
necessity, our entire Church has besought with fasting and much
supplication, the spirit of the dead has returned, <span
id="fr_1461"></span>[1462](#fn_1461.md) and the man has been restored
through the prayers of the saints.”

<span id="iii.x.viii-p10"></span>3. And again, after other remarks, he
says: <span id="fr_1462"></span>[1463](#fn_1462.md)

<span id="iii.x.viii-p12"></span><span id="page_222">p. 222</span> <span
id="iii.x.viii-Page_222"></span>“If they will say that even the Lord did
these things in mere appearance, we will refer them to the prophetic
writings, and show from them that all things were beforehand spoken of
him in this manner, and were strictly fulfilled; and that he alone is
the Son of God. Wherefore his true disciples, receiving grace from him,
perform such works in his Name for the benefit of other men, as each has
received the gift from him.

<span id="iii.x.viii-p13"></span>4. For some of them drive out demons
effectually and truly, so that those who have been cleansed from evil
spirits frequently believe and unite with the Church. Others have a
foreknowledge of future events, and visions, and prophetic revelations.
Still others heal the sick by the laying on of hands, and restore them
to health. And, as we have said, even dead persons have been raised, and
remained with us many years.

<span id="iii.x.viii-p14"></span>5. But why should we say more? It is
not possible to recount the number of gifts which the Church, throughout
all the world, has received from God in the name of Jesus Christ, who
was crucified under Pontius Pilate, and exercises every day for the
benefit of the heathen, never deceiving any nor doing it for money. For
as she has received freely from God, freely also does she
minister.” <span id="fr_1463"></span>[1464](#fn_1463.md)

<span id="iii.x.viii-p16"></span>6. And in another place the same author
writes: <span id="fr_1464"></span>[1465](#fn_1464.md)

<span id="iii.x.viii-p18"></span>“As also we hear that many brethren in
the Church possess prophetic gifts, and speak, through the Spirit, with
all kinds of tongues, and bring to light the secret things of men for
their good, and declare the mysteries of God.”

<span id="iii.x.viii-p19"></span>So much in regard to the fact that
various gifts remained among those who were worthy even until that time.

This work of Irenæus, which is commonly known under its Latin title,
*Adversus Hæreses (Against Heresies),* is still extant in a barbarous
Latin version, of which we possess three <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.x.viii-p4.4"></span>mss.</span> The original Greek is lost,
though a great part of the first book can be recovered by means of
extensive quotations made from it by Hippolytus and Epiphanius. The work
is directed against the various Gnostic systems, among which that of
Valentinus is chiefly attacked. The first book is devoted to a statement
of their doctrines, the second to a refutation of them, and the
remaining three to a presentation of the true doctrines of Christianity
as opposed to the false positions of the Gnostics. The best edition of
the original is that of Harvey: *S. Irenæi libros quinque adv.
Hæreses.,* Cambr. 1857, 2 vols.; English translation in the *Ante-Nicene
Fathers,* I. p. 309 ff. For the literature of the subject, see Schaff,
II. p. 746 ff. On Irenæus himself, see Book IV. chap. 21, note 9.

<span id="fn_1460"></span>[221:1461](2010148.htm#fr_1460.md) <span
id="iii.x.viii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.viii-p6"></span> *Adv. Hær.* II. 31. 2. The sentence as
it stands in Eusebius is incomplete. Irenæus is refuting the pretended
miracles of Simon and Carpocrates. The passage runs as follows: “So far
are they \[i.e. Simon and Carpocrates\] from being able to raise the
dead as the Lord raised them and as the apostles did by means of prayer,
and as has been frequently done in the brotherhood on account of some
necessity—the entire Church in that locality entreating with much
fasting and prayer \[so that\] the spirit of the dead man has returned,
and he has been bestowed in answer to the prayer of the saints—that they
do not even believe this can possibly be done, \[and hold\] that the
resurrection from the dead is simply an acquaintance with that truth
which they proclaim.”

<span id="iii.x.viii-p7"></span>This resurrection of the dead recorded
by Irenæus is very difficult to explain, as he is a truth-loving man,
and we can hardly conceive of his uttering a direct falsehood. Even
Augustine, “the iron man of truth,” records such miracles, and so the
early centuries are full of accounts of them. The Protestant method of
drawing a line between the apostolic and post-apostolic ages in this
matter of miracles is arbitrary, and based upon dogmatic, not historical
grounds. The truth is, that no one can fix the point of time at which
miracles ceased; at the same time it is easy to appreciate the
difference between the apostolic age and the third, fourth, and
following centuries in this regard. That they did cease at an early date
in the history of the Church is clear enough. Upon post-apostolic
miracles, see Schaff, *Ch. Hist.* II. p. 116 ff., J. H. Newman’s *Two
Essays on Biblical and Eccles. Miracles,* and J. B. Mozley’s Bampton
lectures *On Miracles.*
