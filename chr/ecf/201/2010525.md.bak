<span id="iv.vi.iii.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI</span>.—*How he ordered a
Council to be held at Nicæa.*

<span id="iv.vi.iii.vi-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.vi-p2.1"></span>Then</span> as if to bring a divine array
against this enemy, he convoked a general council, and invited the
speedy attendance of bishops from all quarters, in letters expressive of
the honorable estimation in which he held them. Nor was this merely the
issuing of a bare command but the emperor’s good will contributed much
to its being carried into effect: for he allowed some the use of the
public means of conveyance, while he afforded to others an ample supply
of horses <span id="fr_3235"></span>[3236](#fn_3235.md) for their
transport. The place, too, selected for the synod, the city Nicæa in
Bithynia (named from “*Victory*”), was appropriate to the
occasion. <span id="fr_3236"></span>[3237](#fn_3236.md) As soon then as the
imperial injunction was generally made known, all with the utmost
willingness hastened thither, as though they would outstrip one another
in a race; for they were impelled by the anticipation of a happy result
to the conference, by the hope of enjoying present peace, and the desire
of beholding something new and strange in the person of so admirable an
emperor. Now when they were all assembled, it appeared evident that the
proceeding was the work of God, inasmuch as men who had been most widely
separated, not merely in sentiment but also personally, and by
difference of country, place, and nation, were here brought together,
and comprised within the walls of a single city, forming as it were a
vast garland of priests, composed of a variety of the choicest flowers.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.vi-p4"></span> The probably apocryphal version of
the summoning letter given by Cowper (*Syr. Misc.*) from the Syriac
gives the reason of the choice of Nicæa, “the excellent temperature of
the air” there.
