<span id="iii.xi.xxv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xi.xxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXV</span>.—*His Review of the
Canonical Scriptures.*

<span id="iii.xi.xxv-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xi.xxv-p2.1"></span>When</span> expounding the first
Psalm, <span id="fr_1969"></span>[1970](#fn_1969.md) he gives a catalogue
of the sacred Scriptures of the Old Testament <span
id="fr_1970"></span>[1971](#fn_1970.md) as follows:

<span id="iii.xi.xxv-p5"></span>“It should be stated that the canonical
books, as the Hebrews have handed them down, are twenty-two;
corresponding with the number of their letters.” Farther on he says:

<span id="iii.xi.xxv-p6"></span>2. “The twenty-two books of the Hebrews
are the following: That which is called by us Genesis, but by the
Hebrews, from the beginning of the book, Bresith, <span
id="fr_1971"></span>[1972](#fn_1971.md) which means, ‘In the beginning’;
Exodus, Welesmoth, <span id="fr_1972"></span>[1973](#fn_1972.md) that is,
‘These are the names’; Leviticus, Wikra, ‘And he called‘; Numbers,
Ammesphekodeim; Deuteronomy, Eleaddebareim, ‘These are the words’;
Jesus, the son of Nave, Josoue ben Noun; Judges and Ruth, among them in
one book, Saphateim; the First and Second of Kings, among them one,
Samouel, that is, ‘The called of God’; the Third and Fourth of Kings in
one, Wammelch David, that is, ‘The kingdom of David’; of the Chronicles,
the First and Second in one, Dabreïamein, that is, ‘Records of days’;
Esdras, <span id="fr_1973"></span>[1974](#fn_1973.md) First and Second in
one, Ezra, that is, ‘An assistant’; the book of Psalms, Spharthelleim;
the Proverbs of Solomon, Meloth; Ecclesiastes, Koelth; the Song of Songs
(not, as some suppose, Songs of Songs), Sir Hassirim; Isaiah, Jessia;
Jeremiah, with Lamentations and the epistle in one, Jeremia; Daniel,
Daniel; Ezekiel, Jezekiel; Job, Job; Esther, Esther. And besides these
there are the Maccabees, which are entitled Sarbeth Sabanaiel.” <span
id="fr_1974"></span>[1975](#fn_1974.md) He gives these in the
above-mentioned work.

<span id="iii.xi.xxv-p11"></span><span id="page_273">p. 273</span> <span
id="iii.xi.xxv-Page_273"></span>3. In his first book on Matthew’s
Gospel, <span id="fr_1975"></span>[1976](#fn_1975.md) maintaining the Canon
of the Church, he testifies that he knows only four Gospels, writing as
follows:

<span id="iii.xi.xxv-p13"></span>4. “Among the four Gospels, <span
id="fr_1976"></span>[1977](#fn_1976.md) which are the only indisputable
ones in the Church of God under heaven, I have learned by tradition that
the first was written by Matthew, who was once a publican, but
afterwards an apostle of Jesus Christ, and it was prepared for the
converts from Judaism, and published in the Hebrew language. <span
id="fr_1977"></span>[1978](#fn_1977.md)

<span id="iii.xi.xxv-p16"></span>5. The second is by Mark, who composed
it according to the instructions of Peter, <span
id="fr_1978"></span>[1979](#fn_1978.md) who in his Catholic epistle
acknowledges him as a son, saying, ‘The church that is at Babylon
elected together with you, saluteth you, and so doth Marcus, my
son.’ <span id="fr_1979"></span>[1980](#fn_1979.md)

<span id="iii.xi.xxv-p19"></span>6. And the third by Luke, the Gospel
commended by Paul, <span id="fr_1980"></span>[1981](#fn_1980.md) and
composed for Gentile converts. Last of all that by John.” <span
id="fr_1981"></span>[1982](#fn_1981.md)

<span id="iii.xi.xxv-p22"></span>7. In the fifth book of his Expositions
of John’s Gospel, he speaks thus concerning the epistles of the
apostles: <span id="fr_1982"></span>[1983](#fn_1982.md) “But he who was
‘made sufficient to be a minister of the New Testament, not of the
letter, but of the Spirit,’ <span id="fr_1983"></span>[1984](#fn_1983.md)
that is, Paul, who ‘fully preached the Gospel from Jerusalem and round
about even unto Illyricum,’ <span id="fr_1984"></span>[1985](#fn_1984.md)
did not write to all the churches which he had instructed and to those
to which he wrote he sent but few lines. <span
id="fr_1985"></span>[1986](#fn_1985.md)

<span id="iii.xi.xxv-p27"></span>8. And Peter, on whom the Church of
Christ is built, ‘against which the gates of hell shall not
prevail,’ <span id="fr_1986"></span>[1987](#fn_1986.md) has left one
acknowledged epistle; perhaps also a second, but this is doubtful. <span
id="fr_1987"></span>[1988](#fn_1987.md)

<span id="iii.xi.xxv-p30"></span>9. Why need we speak of him who
reclined upon the bosom of Jesus, <span
id="fr_1988"></span>[1989](#fn_1988.md) John, who has left us one
Gospel, <span id="fr_1989"></span>[1990](#fn_1989.md) though he confessed
that he might write so many that the world could not contain them? <span
id="fr_1990"></span>[1991](#fn_1990.md) And he wrote also the Apocalypse,
but was commanded to keep silence and not to write the words of the
seven thunders. <span id="fr_1991"></span>[1992](#fn_1991.md)

<span id="iii.xi.xxv-p35"></span>10. He has left also an epistle of very
few lines; perhaps also a second and third; but not all consider them
genuine, and together they do not contain hundred lines.”

<span id="iii.xi.xxv-p36"></span>11. In addition he makes the following
statements in regard to the Epistle to the Hebrews <span
id="fr_1992"></span>[1993](#fn_1992.md) in his Homilies upon it: “That the
verbal style of the epistle entitled ‘To the Hebrews,’ is not rude like
the language of the apostle, who acknowledged himself ‘rude in
speech’ <span id="fr_1993"></span>[1994](#fn_1993.md) that is, in
expression; but that its diction is purer Greek, any one who has the
power to discern differences of phraseology will acknowledge.

<span id="iii.xi.xxv-p39"></span>12. Moreover, that the thoughts of the
epistle are admirable, and not inferior to the acknowledged apostolic
writings, any one who carefully examines the apostolic text <span
id="fr_1994"></span>[1995](#fn_1994.md) will admit.’

<span id="iii.xi.xxv-p41"></span>13. Farther on he adds: “If I gave my
opinion, I should say that the thoughts are those of the apostle, but
the diction and phraseology are those of some one who remembered the
apostolic teachings, and wrote down at his leisure what had been said by
his teacher. Therefore if any church holds that this epistle is by Paul,
let it be commended for this. For not without reason have the ancients
handed it down as Paul’s.

<span id="iii.xi.xxv-p42"></span>14. But who wrote the epistle, in
truth, God knows. The statement of some who have gone before us is that
Clement, bishop of the Romans, wrote the epistle, and of others that
Luke, the author of the Gospel and the Acts, wrote it.” But let this
suffice on these matters.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1969"></span>[272:1970](2010195.htm#fr_1969.md) <span
id="iii.xi.xxv-p2.2"></span>

<span id="iii.xi.xxv-p3"></span> On Origen’s commentary on Psalms, see
the previous chapter, note 3. The first fragment given here by Eusebius
is found also in the *Philocalia,* chap. 3, where it forms part of a
somewhat longer extract. The second fragment is extant only in this
chapter of Eusebius’ History.

<span id="fn_1970"></span>[272:1971](2010195.htm#fr_1970.md) <span
id="iii.xi.xxv-p3.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xi.xxv-p4"></span> On the Hebrew canon of the Old
Testament, see Bk. III. chap. 10, note 1. Upon Origen’s omission of the
twelve minor prophets and the insertion of the apocryphal epistle of
Jeremiah, see the same note.

<span id="fn_1971"></span>[272:1972](2010195.htm#fr_1971.md) <span
id="iii.xi.xxv-p6.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xi.xxv-p7"></span> I have reproduced Origen’s Greek
transliteration of this and the following Hebrew words letter by letter.
It will be seen by a comparison of the words with the Hebrew titles of
the books, as we now have them, that Origen’s pronunciation of Hebrew,
even after making all due allowance for a difference in the
pronunciation of the Greek and for changes in the Hebrew text, must have
been, in many respects, quite different from ours.

<span id="fn_1972"></span>[272:1973](2010195.htm#fr_1972.md) <span
id="iii.xi.xxv-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xi.xxv-p8"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xi.xxv-p8.1"></span>Οὐελεσμώθ</span>. I represent the diphthong
<span class="Greek"><span id="iii.xi.xxv-p8.2"></span>οὐ</span> at the
beginning of a word by “w.”

<span id="fn_1973"></span>[272:1974](2010195.htm#fr_1973.md) <span
id="iii.xi.xxv-p8.3"></span>

<span id="iii.xi.xxv-p9"></span> The first and second books of Esdras
here referred to are not the apocryphal books known by that name, but
Ezra and Nehemiah, which in the Hebrew canon formed but one book, as
Origen says here, but which in the LXX were separated (see above, Bk.
III. chap. 10, note 4). Esdras is simply the form which the word Ezra
assumes in Greek.

<span id="fn_1974"></span>[272:1975](2010195.htm#fr_1974.md) <span
id="iii.xi.xxv-p9.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xi.xxv-p10"></span> Whether this sentence closed Origen’s
discussion of the Hebrew canon, or whether he went on to mention the
other apocryphal books, we cannot tell. The latter seems intrinsically
much more probable, for it is difficult to understand the insertion of
the Maccabees in this connection, and the omission of all the others;
for the Maccabees, as is clear from the words <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xi.xxv-p10.1"></span>ž</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xi.xxv-p10.2"></span>ξω δὲ τούτων ἐστὶ τὰ Μακκαβαϊκ€</span>, are
not reckoned by Origen among the twenty-two books as a part of the
Hebrew canon. At the same time, it is hardly conceivable that Eusebius
should have broken off thus, in the midst of a passage, without any
explanation; though it is, of course, not impossible that he gives only
the first sentence of the new paragraph on the books of the LXX, in
order to show that the discussion of the Hebrew canon closes, and a new
subject is introduced at this point. But, however that may be, it must
be regarded as certain that Origen did not reckon the books of the
Maccabees as a part of the Hebrew canon, and on the other hand, that he
did reckon those books, as well as others (if not all) of the books
given in the LXX, as inspired Scripture. This latter fact is proved by
his use of these books indiscriminately with those of the Hebrew canon
as sources for dogmatic proof texts, and also by his express citation of
at least some of them as Scripture (cf. on this subject, Redepenning, p.
235 sq.). We must conclude, therefore, that Origen did not adopt the
Hebrew canon as his own, but that he states it as clearly as he does in
this place, in order to bring concretely before the minds of his readers
the difference between the canon of the Jews and the canon of the
Christians, who looked upon the LXX as the more authoritative form of
the Old Testament. Perhaps he had in view the same purpose that led him
to compare the Hebrew text and the LXX in his *Hexapla* (see chap. 16,
note 8).

<span id="fn_1975"></span>[273:1976](2010195.htm#fr_1975.md) <span
id="iii.xi.xxv-p11.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xi.xxv-p12"></span> On Origen’s Commentary on Matthew, see
chap. 36, note 4. The fragment given here by Eusebius is all that is
extant of the first book of the commentary.

<span id="fn_1976"></span>[273:1977](2010195.htm#fr_1976.md) <span
id="iii.xi.xxv-p13.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xi.xxv-p14"></span> Compare Origen’s *Hom. I. in Lucam:
Ecclesia quatuor habet evangelia, hæresea plurima;* and *multi conati
sunt scribere, sed et multi conati sunt ordinare: quatuor tantum
evangelia sunt probata,* &c. Compare also Irenæus, *Adv. Hær.* III. 11,
8, where the attempt is made to show that it is impossible for the
Gospels to be either more or fewer in number than four; and the
Muratorian Fragment where the four Gospels are named, but the number
four is not represented as in itself the necessary number; also
Tertullian’s *Adv. Marc.* IV. 2, and elsewhere.

extracts given here by Eusebius are the only fragments of Origen’s
Homilies on the Epistle to the Hebrews now extant. Four brief Latin
fragments of his commentary upon that epistle are preserved in the first
book of Pamphilus’ *Defense of Origen,* and are printed by Lommatzsch in
Vol. V. p. 297 sq. The commentaries (or “books,” as they are called) are
mentioned only in that *Defense.* The catalogue of Jerome speaks only of
“eighteen homilies.” We know nothing about the extent or the date of
composition of these homilies and commentaries.

<span class="Greek"><span id="iii.xi.xxv-p40.2"></span>&
135·ν€γνωσις</span> meant originally the act of reading, then also that
which is read. It thus came to be used (like <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xi.xxv-p40.3"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xi.xxv-p40.4"></span>ν€γνωσμα</span>) of the pericope or text or
section of the Scripture read in church, and in the plural to designate
the church lectionaries, or service books. In the present case it is
used evidently in a wider sense of the text of Paul’s writings as a
whole. This use of the two words to indicate, not simply the selection
read in church, but the text of a book or books as a whole, was not at
all uncommon, as may be seen from the examples given by Suicer, although
he does not mention this wider signification among the uses of the word.
See his *Thesaurus, s.v.*
