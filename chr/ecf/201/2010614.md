the Churches, and Bounties to Virgins and to the Poor.*

<span id="iv.vi.iv.xxviii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.xxviii-p2.1"></span>His</span> liberality, however, was
most especially exercised on behalf of the churches of God. In some
cases he granted lands, in others he issued supplies of food for the
support of the poor, of orphan children, and widows; besides which, he
evinced much care and forethought in fully providing the naked and
destitute with clothing. He distinguished, however, with most special
honor those who had devoted their lives to the practice of Divine
philosophy. Hence his respect, little short of veneration, for God’s
most holy and ever virgin choir: for he felt assured that the God to
whom such persons devoted themselves was himself an inmate of their
souls.
