<span id="iii.vi.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.vi.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter</span> II.—*Summary View of the
Pre-existence and Divinity of Our Saviour and Lord Jesus Christ.*

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.vi.ii-p2.1"></span>Since</span> in Christ there is a twofold
nature, and the one—in so far as he is thought of as God—resembles the
head of the body, while the other may be compared with the feet,—in so
far as he, for the sake of our salvation, put on human nature with the
same passions as our own,—the following work will be complete only if we
begin with the chief and lordliest events of all his history. In this
way will the antiquity and divinity of Christianity be shown to those
who suppose it of recent and foreign origin, <span
id="fr_20"></span>[21](#fn_20.md) and imagine that it appeared only
yesterday. <span id="fr_21"></span>[22](#fn_21.md)

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p5"></span>2. No language is sufficient to express
the origin and the worth, the being and the nature of Christ. Wherefore
also the divine Spirit says in the prophecies, “Who shall declare his
generation?” <span id="fr_22"></span>[23](#fn_22.md) For none knoweth the
Father except the Son, neither can any one know the Son adequately
except the Father alone who hath begotten him. <span
id="fr_23"></span>[24](#fn_23.md)

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p8"></span>3. For who beside the Father could
clearly understand the Light which was before the world, the
intellectual and essential Wisdom which existed before the ages, the
living Word which was in the beginning with the Father and which was
God, the first and only begotten of God which was before every creature
and creation visible and invisible, the commander-in-chief of the
rational and immortal host of heaven, the messenger of the great
counsel, the executor of the Father’s unspoken will, the creator, with
the Father, of all things, the second cause of the universe after the
Father, the true and only-begotten Son of God, the Lord and God and King
of all created things, the one who has received dominion and power, with
divinity itself, and with might and honor from the Father; as it is said
in regard to him in the mystical passages of Scripture which speak of
his divinity: “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God,
and the Word was God.” <span id="fr_24"></span>[25](#fn_24.md) “All things
were made by him; and without him was not anything made.” <span
id="fr_25"></span>[26](#fn_25.md)

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p11"></span>4. This, too, the great Moses teaches,
when, as the most ancient of all the prophets, he describes under the
influence of the divine Spirit the creation and arrangement of the
universe. He declares that the maker of the world and the creator of all
things yielded to Christ himself, and to none other than his own clearly
divine and first-born Word, the making of inferior things, and communed
with him respecting the creation of man. “For,” says he, “God said, Let
us make man in our image and in our likeness.” <span
id="fr_26"></span>[27](#fn_26.md)

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p13"></span>5. And another of the prophets confirms
this, speaking of God in his hymns as follows: “He spake and they were
made; he commanded and they were created.” <span
id="fr_27"></span>[28](#fn_27.md) He here introduces the Father and Maker
as Ruler of all, commanding with a kingly nod, and second to him the
divine Word, none other than the one who is proclaimed by us, as
carrying out <span id="page_83">p. 83</span> <span
id="iii.vi.ii-Page_83"></span>the Father’s commands.

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p15"></span>6. All that are said to have excelled in
righteousness and piety since the creation of man, the great servant
Moses and before him in the first place Abraham and his children, and as
many righteous men and prophets as afterward appeared, have contemplated
him with the pure eyes of the mind, and have recognized him and offered
to him the worship which is due him as Son of God.

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p16"></span>7. But he, by no means neglectful of the
reverence due to the Father, was appointed to teach the knowledge of the
Father to them all. For instance, the Lord God, it is said, appeared as
a common man to Abraham while he was sitting at the oak of Mambre. <span
id="fr_28"></span>[29](#fn_28.md) And he, immediately falling down,
although he saw a man with his eyes, nevertheless worshiped him as God,
and sacrificed to him as Lord, and confessed that he was not ignorant of
his identity when he uttered the words, “Lord, the judge of all the
earth, wilt thou not execute righteous judgment?” <span
id="fr_29"></span>[30](#fn_29.md)

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p19"></span>8. For if it is unreasonable to suppose
that the unbegotten and immutable essence of the almighty God was
changed into the form of man or that it deceived the eyes of the
beholders with the appearance of some created thing, and if it is
unreasonable to suppose, on the other hand, that the Scripture should
falsely invent such things, when the God and Lord who judgeth all the
earth and executeth judgment is seen in the form of a man, who else can
be called, if it be not lawful to call him the first cause of all
things, than his only pre-existent Word? <span
id="fr_30"></span>[31](#fn_30.md) Concerning whom it is said in the Psalms,
“He sent his Word and healed them, and delivered them from their
destructions.” <span id="fr_31"></span>[32](#fn_31.md)

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p22"></span>9. Moses most clearly proclaims him
second Lord after the Father, when he says, “The Lord rained upon Sodom
and Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the Lord.” <span
id="fr_32"></span>[33](#fn_32.md) The divine Scripture also calls him God,
when he appeared again to Jacob in the form of a man, and said to Jacob,
“Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name,
because thou hast prevailed with God.” <span
id="fr_33"></span>[34](#fn_33.md) Wherefore also Jacob called the name of
that place “Vision of God,” <span id="fr_34"></span>[35](#fn_34.md) saying,
“For I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.” <span
id="fr_35"></span>[36](#fn_35.md)

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p27"></span>10. Nor is it admissible to suppose that
the theophanies recorded were appearances of subordinate angels and
ministers of God, for whenever any of these appeared to men, the
Scripture does not conceal the fact, but calls them by name not God nor
Lord, but angels, as it is easy to prove by numberless testimonies.

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p28"></span>11. Joshua, also, the successor of
Moses, calls him, as leader of the heavenly angels and archangels and of
the supramundane powers, and as lieutenant of the Father, <span
id="fr_36"></span>[37](#fn_36.md) entrusted with the second rank of
sovereignty and rule over all, “captain of the host of the Lord,”
although he saw him not otherwise than again in the form and appearance
of a man. For it is written:

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p30"></span>12. “And it came to pass when Joshua was
at Jericho <span id="fr_37"></span>[38](#fn_37.md) that he looked and saw a
man standing over against him with his sword drawn in his hand, and
Joshua went unto him and said, Art thou for us or for our adversaries?
And he said unto him, As captain of the host of the Lord am I now come.
And Joshua fell on his face to the earth and said unto him, Lord, what
dost thou command thy servant? and the captain of the Lord said unto
Joshua, Loose thy shoe from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou
standest is holy.” <span id="fr_38"></span>[39](#fn_38.md)

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p33"></span>13. You will perceive also from the same
words that this was no other than he who talked with Moses. <span
id="fr_39"></span>[40](#fn_39.md) For the Scripture says in the same words
and with reference to the same one, “When the Lord saw that he drew near
to see, the Lord called to him out of the bush and said, Moses, Moses.
And he said, What is it? And he said, Draw not nigh hither; loose thy
shoe from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy
ground. And he said unto him, I am the God of thy fathers, the God of
Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.” <span
id="fr_40"></span>[41](#fn_40.md)

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p36"></span>14. And that there is a certain
substance which lived and subsisted <span id="fr_41"></span>[42](#fn_41.md)
before the world, and which ministered unto the Father and God of the
universe for the formation of all created things, and which is called
the Word of God and Wisdom, we may learn, to quote other proofs in
addition to those already cited, from the mouth of Wisdom herself, who
reveals most clearly through Solomon the following mysteries concerning
herself: “I, Wisdom, have dwelt <span id="page_84">p. 84</span> <span
id="iii.vi.ii-Page_84"></span>with prudence and knowledge, and I have
invoked understanding. Through me kings reign, and princes ordain
righteousness. Through me the great are magnified, and through me
sovereigns rule the earth.” <span id="fr_42"></span>[43](#fn_42.md)

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p39"></span>15. To which she adds: “The Lord created
me in the beginning of his ways, for his works; before the world he
established me, in the beginning, before he made the earth, before he
made the depths, before the mountains were settled, before all hills he
begat me. When he prepared the heavens I was present with him, and when
he established the fountains of the region under heaven <span
id="fr_43"></span>[44](#fn_43.md) I was with him, disposing. I was the one
in whom he delighted; daily I rejoiced before him at all times when he
was rejoicing at having completed the world.” <span
id="fr_44"></span>[45](#fn_44.md)

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p42"></span>16. That the divine Word, therefore,
pre-existed and appeared to some, if not to all, has thus been briefly
shown by us.

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p43"></span>17. But why the Gospel was not preached
in ancient times to all men and to all nations, as it is now, will
appear from the following considerations. <span
id="fr_45"></span>[46](#fn_45.md) The life of the ancients was not of such
a kind as to permit them to receive the all-wise and all-virtuous
teaching of Christ.

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p45"></span>18. For immediately in the beginning,
after his original life of blessedness, the first man despised the
command of God, and fell into this mortal and perishable state, and
exchanged his former divinely inspired luxury for this curse-laden
earth. His descendants having filled our earth, showed themselves much
worse, with the exception of one here and there, and entered upon a
certain brutal and insupportable mode of life.

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p46"></span>19. They thought neither of city nor
state, neither of arts nor sciences. They were ignorant even of the name
of laws and of justice, of virtue and of philosophy. As nomads, they
passed their lives in deserts, like wild and fierce beasts, destroying,
by an excess of voluntary wickedness, the natural reason of man, and the
seeds of thought and of culture implanted in the human soul. They gave
themselves wholly over to all kinds of profanity, now seducing one
another, now slaying one another, now eating human flesh, and now daring
to wage war with the Gods and to undertake those battles of the giants
celebrated by all; now planning to fortify earth against heaven, and in
the madness of ungoverned pride to prepare an attack upon the very God
of all. <span id="fr_46"></span>[47](#fn_46.md)

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p48"></span>20. On account of these things, when
they conducted themselves thus, the all-seeing God sent down upon them
floods and conflagrations as upon a wild forest spread over the whole
earth. He cut them down with continuous famines and plagues, with wars,
and with thunderbolts from heaven, as if to check some terrible and
obstinate disease of souls with more severe punishments.

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p49"></span>21. Then, when the excess of wickedness
had overwhelmed nearly all the race, like a deep fit of drunkenness,
beclouding and darkening the minds of men, the first-born and
first-created wisdom of God, the pre-existent Word himself, induced by
his exceeding love for man, appeared to his servants, now in the form of
angels, and again to one and another of those ancients who enjoyed the
favor of God, in his own person as the saving power of God, not
otherwise, however, than in the shape of man, because it was impossible
to appear in any other way.

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p50"></span>22. And as by them the seeds of piety
were sown among a multitude of men and the whole nation, descended from
the Hebrews, devoted themselves persistently to the worship of God, he
imparted to them through the prophet Moses, as to multitudes still
corrupted by their ancient practices, images and symbols of a certain
mystic Sabbath and of circumcision, and elements of other spiritual
principles, but he did not grant them a complete knowledge of the
mysteries themselves.

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p51"></span>23. But when their law became
celebrated, and, like a sweet odor, was diffused among all men, as a
result of their influence the dispositions of the majority of the
heathen were softened by the lawgivers and philosophers who arose on
every side, and their wild and savage brutality was changed into
mildness, so that they enjoyed deep peace, friendship, and social
intercourse. <span id="fr_47"></span>[48](#fn_47.md) Then, finally, at the
time of the origin of the Roman Empire, there appeared again to all men
and nations throughout the world, who had been, as it were, previously
assisted, and were now fitted to receive the knowledge of the Father,
that same teacher <span id="page_85">p. 85</span> <span
id="iii.vi.ii-Page_85"></span>of virtue, the minister of the Father in
all good things, the divine and heavenly Word of God, in a human body
not at all differing in substance from our own. He did and suffered the
things which had been prophesied. For it had been foretold that one who
was at the same time man and God should come and dwell in the world,
should perform wonderful works, and should show himself a teacher to all
nations of the piety of the Father. The marvelous nature of his birth,
and his new teaching, and his wonderful works had also been foretold; so
likewise the manner of his death, his resurrection from the dead, and,
finally, his divine ascension into heaven.

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p53"></span>24. For instance, Daniel the prophet,
under the influence of the divine Spirit, seeing his kingdom at the end
of time, <span id="fr_48"></span>[49](#fn_48.md) was inspired thus to
describe the divine vision in language fitted to human comprehension:
“For I beheld,” he says, “until thrones were placed, and the Ancient of
Days did sit, whose garment was white as snow and the hair of his head
like pure wool; his throne was a flame of fire and his wheels burning
fire. A river of fire flowed before him. Thousand thousands ministered
unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him. He
appointed judgment, and the books were opened.” <span
id="fr_49"></span>[50](#fn_49.md)

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p56"></span>25. And again, “I saw,” says he, “and
behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and he
hastened unto the Ancient of Days and was brought into his presence, and
there was given him the dominion and the glory and the kingdom; and all
peoples, tribes, and tongues serve him. His dominion is an everlasting
dominion which shall not pass away, and his kingdom shall not be
destroyed.” <span id="fr_50"></span>[51](#fn_50.md)

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p58"></span>26. It is clear that these words can
refer to no one else than to our Saviour, the God Word who was in the
beginning with God, and who was called the Son of man because of his
final appearance in the flesh.

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p59"></span>27. But since we have collected in
separate books <span id="fr_51"></span>[52](#fn_51.md) the selections from
the prophets which relate to our Saviour Jesus Christ, and have arranged
in a more logical form those things which have been revealed concerning
him, what has been said will suffice for the present.

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p4"></span> This was one of the principal objections
raised against Christianity. Antiquity was considered a prime requisite
in a religion which claimed to be true, and no reproach was greater than
the reproach of novelty. Hence the apologists laid great stress upon the
antiquity of Christianity, and this was one reason why they appropriated
the Old Testament as a Christian book. Compare, for instance, the
apologies of Justin Martyr, Tatian, Athenagoras, Theophilus, Tertullian
and Minucius Felix, and the works of Clement of Alexandria. See
Engelhardt’s article on Eusebius, in the *Zeitschrift für die hist.
Theologie*, 1852, p. 652 sq.; Schaff’s *Church History*, Vol. II. p.

There is really nothing in this passage to imply that the Psalmist
thinks, as Eusebius supposes, of the Son as the Father’s agent in
creation, who is here addressed by the Father. As Stroth remarks,
“According to Eusebius, ‘He spake’ is equivalent to ‘He said to the Son,
Create’; and ‘They were created’ means, according to him, not ‘They
arose immediately upon this command of God,’ but ‘The Son was
immediately obedient to the command of the Father and produced them.’
For Eusebius connects this verse with the sixth, ‘By the *word* of the
Lord were the heavens made,’ where he understands Christ to be referred
to. Perhaps this verse has been omitted in the Greek through an
oversight, for it is found in Rufinus.”

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p20"></span> Eusebius accepts the common view of the
early Church, that the theophanies of the Old Testament were
Christophanies; that is, appearances of the second person of the
Trinity. Augustine seems to have been the first of the Fathers to take a
different view, maintaining that such Christophanies were not consistent
with the identity of essence between Father and Son, and that the
Scriptures themselves teach that it was not the Logos, but an angel,
that appeared to the Old Testament worthies on various occasions (cf.
*De Trin.* III. 11). Augustine’s opinion was widely adopted, but in
modern times the earlier view, which Eusebius represents, has been the
prevailing one (see Hodge, *Systematic Theology*, I. p. 490, and Lange’s
article *Theophany* in Herzog).

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p34"></span> Eusebius agrees with other earlier
Fathers (e.g. Justin Martyr, Origen, and Cyprian) in identifying the one
that appeared to Joshua with him that had appeared to Moses, on the
ground that the same words were used in both cases (cf. especially
Justin’s *Dial. c. Trypho*, chap. 62). Many later Fathers (e.g.
Theodoret) regard the person that appeared to Joshua as the archangel

<span id="fn_44"></span>[84:45](2010029.htm#fr_44.md) <span

<span id="fn_45"></span>[84:46](2010029.htm#fr_45.md) <span
id="iii.vi.ii-p43.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p44"></span> Eusebius pursues much the same line of
argument in his *Dem. Evang*., Prœm. Bk. VIII.; and compare also Gregory
of Nyssa’s Third Oration on the birth of the Lord (at the beginning).
The objection which Eusebius undertakes to answer here was an old one,
and had been considered by Justin Martyr, by Origen in his work against
Celsus, and by others (see Tzschirner’s *Geschichte der Apologetik,* p.
25 ff.).

<span id="fn_46"></span>[84:47](2010029.htm#fr_46.md) <span
id="iii.vi.ii-p46.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p47"></span> The reference here seems to be to the
building of the tower of Babel (<span id="iii.vi.ii-p47.1"></span>[Gen.
xi. 1-9](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#001.md)<span
id="iii.vi.ii-p47.2"></span>), although Valesius thinks otherwise. The
fact that Eusebius refers to the battles of the giants, which were
celebrated in heathen song, does not militate against a reference in
this passage to the narrative recounted in Genesis. He illustrates the
presumption of the human race by instances familiar to his readers
whether drawn from Christian or from Pagan sources. Compare the *Præp.
Evang*. ix. 14.

<span id="fn_47"></span>[84:48](2010029.htm#fr_47.md) <span
id="iii.vi.ii-p51.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p52"></span> It was the opinion of Eusebius, in
common with most of the Fathers, that the Greek philosophers, lawgivers,
and poets had obtained their wisdom from the ancient Hebrews, and this
point was pressed very strongly by many of the apologists in their
effort to prove the antiquity of Christianity. The assertion was made
especially in the case of Plato and Pythagoras, who were said to have
become acquainted with the books of the Hebrews upon their journey to
Egypt. Compare among other passages Justin’s *Apol*. I. 59 ff.; Clement
of Alexandria’s *Cohort. ad Gentes*, chap. 6; and Tertullian’s *Apol.*
chap. 47. Compare also Eusebius’ *Præp. Evang.,* Bks. IX. and X.

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p54"></span> The Greek has only <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.vi.ii-p54.1"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.vi.ii-p54.2"></span>πὶ τέλει</span>, which
can refer, however, only to the end of time or to the end of the world.

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p60"></span> Eusebius refers here probably to his
*Eclogæ propheticæ*, or *Prophetical Extracts,* possibly to his *Dem.
Evang.;* upon these works see the Prolegomena, p. 34 and. 37, above.
