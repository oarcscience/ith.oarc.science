<span id="iii.xvi.i-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xvi.i-p2.1"></span>Chapter I.—</span>*The Peace granted us by
God.*

<span id="iii.xvi.i-p3"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xvi.i-p3.1"></span>Thanks</span> for all things be given unto
God the Omnipotent Ruler and King of the universe, and the greatest
thanks to Jesus Christ the Saviour and Redeemer of our souls, through
whom we pray that peace may be always preserved for us firm and
undisturbed by external troubles and by troubles of the mind.

<span id="iii.xvi.i-p4"></span>2. Since in accordance with thy wishes,
my most holy Paulinus, <span id="fr_2798"></span>[2799](#fn_2798.md) we
have added the tenth book of the Church History to those which have
preceded, <span id="fr_2799"></span>[2800](#fn_2799.md) we will inscribe it
to thee, proclaiming thee as the seal of the whole work; and we will
fitly add in a perfect number the perfect panegyric upon the restoration
of the churches, <span id="fr_2800"></span>[2801](#fn_2800.md) obeying the
Divine Spirit which exhorts us in the following words:

<span id="iii.xvi.i-p8"></span>3. “Sing unto the Lord a new song, for he
hath done marvelous things. His right hand and his holy arm hath saved
him. The Lord hath made known his salvation, his righteousness hath he
revealed in the presence of the nations.” <span
id="fr_2801"></span>[2802](#fn_2801.md)

<span id="iii.xvi.i-p10"></span>4. And in accordance with the utterance
which commands us to sing the new song, let us proceed to show that,
after those terrible and gloomy spectacles which we have
described, <span id="fr_2802"></span>[2803](#fn_2802.md) we are now
permitted to see and celebrate such things as many truly righteous men
and martyrs of God before us desired to see upon earth and did not see,
and to hear and did not hear. <span id="fr_2803"></span>[2804](#fn_2803.md)

<span id="iii.xvi.i-p13"></span>5. But they, hastening on, obtained far
better things, <span id="fr_2804"></span>[2805](#fn_2804.md) being carried
to heaven and the paradise of divine pleasure. But, acknowledging that
even these things are greater than we deserve, we have been astonished
at the grace manifested by the author of the great gifts, and rightly do
we admire him, worshiping him with the whole power of our souls, and
testifying to the truth of those recorded utterances, in which it is
said, “Come and see the works of the Lord, the wonders which he hath
done upon the earth; he removeth wars to the ends of the world, he shall
break the bow and snap the spear in sunder, and shall burn the shields
with fire.” <span id="fr_2805"></span>[2806](#fn_2805.md)

<span id="iii.xvi.i-p16"></span>6. Rejoicing in these things which have
been clearly fulfilled in our day, let us proceed with our account.

<span id="iii.xvi.i-p17"></span>7. The whole race of God’s enemies was
destroyed in the manner indicated, <span
id="fr_2806"></span>[2807](#fn_2806.md) and was thus suddenly swept from
the sight of men. So that again a divine utterance had its fulfillment:
“I have seen the impious highly exalted and raising himself like the
cedars of Lebanon and I have passed by, and behold, he was not and I
have sought his place, and it could not be found.” <span
id="fr_2807"></span>[2808](#fn_2807.md)

<span id="iii.xvi.i-p20"></span>8. And finally a bright and splendid
day, overshadowed by no cloud, illuminated with beams of heavenly light
the churches of Christ throughout the entire world. And not even those
without our communion <span id="fr_2808"></span>[2809](#fn_2808.md) were
prevented from sharing in the same blessings, or at least from coming
under their influ<span id="page_370">p. 370</span> <span
id="iii.xvi.i-Page_370"></span>ence and enjoying a part of the benefits
bestowed upon us by God. <span id="fr_2809"></span>[2810](#fn_2809.md)

<span id="iii.xvi.i-p5"></span> Paulinus, bishop of Tyre, became
afterward bishop of Antioch, as we are told by Eusebius, *Contra
Marcellum*, I. 4, and by Philostorgius, *H. E*. III. 15. According to
Jerome’s *Chron*, year of Abr. 2345, he was the successor of Philogonius
and the predecessor of Eustathius in the episcopate of Antioch. He was
still alive when Eusebius completed his *History*, that is, at least as
late as 323 (see above, p. 45), but he was already dead when the Council
of Nicæa met; for Eustathius was at that time bishop of Antioch (see
e.g. Sozomen, *H. E.* I. 17, Theodoret, *H. E.* I. 7, and the Acts of
the Council of Nicæa, ed. Labbei et Cossartii, I. p. 51), and Zeno,
bishop of Tyre (see the Acts of the Nicene Council, *ibid*.).
Philostorgius (*ibid*.) informs us that he became bishop of Antioch but
six months before his death, and there is no reason to doubt the
statement. Eusebius speaks of him in the highest terms, both here and in
his *Contra Marcellum*, and it was at the dedication of his church in
Tyre that he delivered the panegyric oration quoted in chap. 4, below.
He is claimed as a sympathizer by Arius in his epistle to Eusebius of
Nicomedia (Theodoret, *H. E.* I. 5), and that he accepted Arius’ tenets
is implied by Eusebius of Nicomedia, who, however, feels obliged to
admonish him for not showing greater zeal in the support of the cause
(see this epistle quoted by Theodoret, *H. E*. I. 6). This is the extent
of our information in regard to him.

<span id="iii.xvi.i-p6"></span> On the date of the composition of the
tenth book of the *History*, and its relation to the earlier books, see
above, p. 45.

<span id="fn_2800"></span>[369:2801](2010298.htm#fr_2800.md) <span
id="iii.xvi.i-p6.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xvi.i-p7"></span> εἰκότως δ᾽ ἐν ἀριθμῷ τελεί& 251· τὸν
τέλειον ἐνταῦθα καὶ πανηγυρικὸν τῆς τῶν ἐκκλησιῶν ἀνανεώσεως λόγον
κατατ€ξομεν. The meaning of this sentence is very obscure. Valesius
translates: *Nec absurde ut opinor, absolutam omnibus numeris orationem
panegyricam de ecclesiarum instauratione hic in perfecto numero
collocabimus*. Stroth, followed by Closs, renders: “Mit Recht werden wir
hier auch eine vollständige feierliche Rede, von der Wiedererneuerung
der Kirchen, als einen ordentlichen Theil miteinrücken.” Crusè reads:
“Justly, indeed, shall we here subjoin in a perfect number a complete
discourse and panegyric on the renovation of the churches.” The “perfect
number” seems to refer to the number of the book (the number ten being
commonly so called in ancient times), to which he has referred in the
previous clause. Could we regard the “perfect panegyric” as referring to
the book as a whole, as Crusè does, the sentence would be somewhat
clearer; but the phrase seems to be a plain reference to the oration
given in chap. 4, especially since Eusebius does not say τῆς ἐκκλησίας,
but τῶν ἐκκλησὶ& 242·ν, as in the title of that oration. I have
preserved the play of words, τελεί& 251·—τέλειον, in order to bring out
Eusebius’ thought more clearly, but it must be remarked that the word
τέλειον does not imply praise of the quality of his oration on the
author’s part. It is used rather in the sense of complete or final,
because it celebrates a completed work, as the tenth book completes his
*History*, and thus crowns the whole.
