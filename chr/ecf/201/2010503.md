id="iv.vi.ii.lviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter LVIII</span>.—*He glorifies him
again for his Government of the Universe.*

<span id="iv.vi.ii.lviii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.lviii-p2.1"></span>The</span> truth of this is assured to
us by thy works. It is thy power which removes our guilt, and makes us
faithful. The sun and the moon have their settled course. The stars move
in no uncertain orbits round this terrestrial globe. The revolution of
the seasons recurs according to unerring laws. The solid fabric of the
earth was established by thy word: the winds receive their impulse at
appointed times; and the course of the waters continues with ceaseless
flow, <span id="fr_3203"></span>[3204](#fn_3203) the ocean is
circumscribed by an immovable barrier, and whatever is comprehended
within the compass of earth and sea, is all contrived for wondrous and
important ends.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.lviii-p4"></span>“Were it not so, were not all
regulated by the determination of thy will, so great a diversity, so
manifold a division of power, would unquestionably have brought ruin on
the whole race and its affairs. For those agencies which have maintained
a mutual strife <span id="fr_3204"></span>[3205](#fn_3204) would thus
have carried to a more deadly length that hostility against the human
race which they even now exercise, though unseen by mortal eyes.
