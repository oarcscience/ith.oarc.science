<span id="iii.xvii.xx-p1"></span> On Bk. VII. chap. 26, § 1 (note 4,
continued).

<span id="iii.xvii.xx-p2"></span>On Dionysius’ attitude toward
Sabellianism and the occasion of the Apology (<span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xvii.xx-p2.1"></span>ž</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xvii.xx-p2.2"></span>λεγχος καὶ ἀπολογία</span>) in four books,
which he addressed to Dionysius of Rome, see Bk. VI. chap. 40, note 1.
This work is no longer extant, but brief fragments of it have been
preserved by Athanasius (in his *De Sent. Dionysii*) and by Basil ( in
his *De Spir. Sancto*). English translation in the *Ante-Nicene
Fathers*, Vol. VI. p. 92 sq. The longer work was preceded by a shorter
one, now lost, to which reference is made in one of the fragments of the
longer work. We do not know the exact date of the work, but may assign
it with considerable probability to the earlier part of the episcopate
of Dionysius of Rome; that is, soon after 259. Upon this work and upon
Dionysius’ attitude toward Sabellianism, see especially Dittrich, *<span
id="iii.xvii.xx-p2.3"></span>Dionysius der Grosse*, p. 91. sq.
