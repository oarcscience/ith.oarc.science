id="iii.xii.xvii-p2.1"></span>Astyrius <span
id="fr_2291"></span>[2292](#fn_2291) </span> also is commemorated on
account of his pious boldness in connection with this affair. He was a
Roman of senatorial rank, and in favor with the emperors, and well known
to all on account of his noble birth and wealth. Being present at the
martyr’s death, he took his body away on his shoulder, and arraying him
in a splendid and costly garment, prepared him for the grave in a
magnificent manner, and gave him fitting burial. <span
id="fr_2292"></span>[2293](#fn_2292) The friends of this man, that
remain to our day, relate many other facts concerning him.

<span id="iii.xii.xvii-p3"></span> We know nothing more about this
Astyrius than is recorded here. Rufinus, in his *H. E.* VII. 13, tells
us that he suffered martyrdom at about this time; but Eusebius says
nothing of the kind, and it is therefore not at all probable that
Rufinus is correct. He probably concluded, from Eusebius’ account of
him, that he also suffered martyrdom.

<span id="iii.xii.xvii-p4"></span> Burton and Crusè close the chapter at
this point, throwing the next sentence into chap. 17. Such a
transposition, however, is unnecessary, and I have preferred to follow
Valesius, Heinichen, Schwegler, and other editors, in dividing as above.
