<span id="iii.ix.xvii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.ix.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVII.—</span>*The Martyrs whom
Justin mentions in his Own Work.*

<span id="iii.ix.xvii-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.ix.xvii-p2.1"></span>The</span> same man, before his conflict,
mentions in his first Apology <span id="fr_1182"></span>[1183](#fn_1182.md)
others that suffered martyrdom before him, and most fittingly records
the following events.

<span id="iii.ix.xvii-p4"></span>2. He writes thus: <span
id="fr_1183"></span>[1184](#fn_1183.md) “A certain woman lived with a
dissolute husband; she herself, too, having formerly been of the same
character. But when she came to the knowledge of the teachings of
Christ, she became temperate, and endeavored to persuade her husband
likewise to be temperate, repeating the teachings, and declaring the
punishment in eternal fire which shall come upon those who do not live
temperately and conformably to right reason.

<span id="iii.ix.xvii-p6"></span>3. But he, continuing in the same
excesses, alienated his wife by his conduct. For she finally, thinking
it wrong to live as a wife with a man who, contrary to the law of nature
and right, sought every possible means of pleasure, desired to be
divorced from him.

<span id="iii.ix.xvii-p7"></span>4. And when she was earnestly entreated
by her friends, who counseled her still to remain with him, on the
ground that her husband might some time give hope of amendment, she did
violence to herself and remained.

<span id="iii.ix.xvii-p8"></span>5. But when her husband had gone to
Alexandria, and was reported to be conducting himself still worse,
she—in order that she might not, by continuing in wedlock, and by
sharing his board and bed, become a partaker in his lawlessness and
impiety—gave him what we <span id="fr_1184"></span>[1185](#fn_1184.md) call
a bill of divorce and left him.

<span id="iii.ix.xvii-p10"></span>6. But her noble and excellent
husband,—instead of rejoicing, as he ought to have done, that she had
given up those actions which she had formerly recklessly committed with
the servants and hirelings, when she delighted in drunkenness and in
every vice, and that she desired him likewise to give them up,—when she
had gone from him contrary to his wish, brought an accusation concerning
her, declaring that she was a Christian.

<span id="iii.ix.xvii-p11"></span>7. And she petitioned you, the
emperor, that she might be permitted first to set her affairs in order,
and afterwards, after the settlement of her affairs, to make her defense
against the accusation. And this you granted.

<span id="iii.ix.xvii-p12"></span>8. But he who had once been her
husband, being no longer able to prosecute her, directed his attacks
against a certain Ptolemæus, <span id="fr_1185"></span>[1186](#fn_1185.md)
who had been her teacher in the doctrines of Christianity, and whom
Urbicius <span id="fr_1186"></span>[1187](#fn_1186.md) had punished.
Against him he proceeded in the following manner:

<span id="iii.ix.xvii-p15"></span>9. “He persuaded a centurion who was
his friend to cast Ptolemæus into prison, and to take him and ask him
this only: whether he were a Christian? And when Ptolemæus, who was a
lover of truth, and not of a deceitful and false disposition, confessed
that he was a Christian, the centurion bound him and punished him for a
long time in the prison.

<span id="iii.ix.xvii-p16"></span>10. And finally, when the man was
brought before Urbicius he was likewise asked this question only:
whether he were a Christian? And again, conscious of the benefits which
he enjoyed through the teaching of Christ, he confessed his schooling in
divine virtue.

<span id="iii.ix.xvii-p17"></span>11. For whoever denies that he is a
Christian, either denies because he despises Christianity, or he avoids
confession because he is conscious that he is unworthy and an alien to
it; neither of which is the case with the true Christian.

<span id="iii.ix.xvii-p18"></span>12. And when Urbicius commanded that
he be led away to punishment, a certain Lucius, <span
id="fr_1187"></span>[1188](#fn_1187.md) who was also a Christian, seeing
judgment so unjustly passed, <span id="page_196">p. 196</span> <span
id="iii.ix.xvii-Page_196"></span>said to Urbicius, ‘Why have you
punished this man who is not an adulterer, nor a fornicator, nor a
murderer, nor a thief, nor a robber, nor has been convicted of
committing any crime at all, but has confessed that he bears the name of
Christian? You do not judge, O Urbicius, in a manner befitting the
Emperor Pius, or the philosophical son <span
id="fr_1188"></span>[1189](#fn_1188.md) of Cæsar, or the sacred senate.’

<span id="iii.ix.xvii-p21"></span>13. And without making any other
reply, he said to Lucius, ‘Thou also seemest to me to be such an one.’
And when Lucius said, ‘Certainly,’ he again commanded that he too should
be led away to punishment. But he professed his thanks, for he was
liberated, he added, from such wicked rulers and was going to the good
Father and King, God. And still a third having come forward was
condemned to be punished.”

<span id="iii.ix.xvii-p22"></span>14. To this, Justin fittingly and
consistently adds the words which we quoted above, <span
id="fr_1189"></span>[1190](#fn_1189.md) saying, “I, too, therefore expect
to be plotted against by some one of those whom I have named,” &c. <span
id="fr_1190"></span>[1191](#fn_1190.md)

id="iii.ix.xvii-p2.2"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.xvii-p3"></span> Eusebius in this chapter quotes what
we now know as Justin’s second *Apology,* calling it his first. It is
plain that the two were but one to him. See chap. 18, note 3.

class="Greek"><span id="iii.ix.xvii-p9.3"></span>ὑ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.ix.xvii-p9.4"></span>μῖν</span>, but I have
followed Heinichen in adopting the former, which has much stronger <span

which is in itself at least as natural as the latter.

<span id="fn_1185"></span>[195:1186](2010126.htm#fr_1185.md) <span
id="iii.ix.xvii-p12.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.xvii-p13"></span> Of this Ptolemæus we know only what
is told us here. Tillemont, Ruinart, and others have fixed the date of
his martyrdom as 166, or thereabouts. But inasmuch as the second Apology
is now commonly regarded as an appendix to, or as a part of, the first,
and was at any rate written during the reign of Antoninus Pius, the
martyrdom of Ptolemæus must have taken place considerably earlier than
the date indicated, in fact in all probability as early as 152 (at about
which time the *Apology* was probably written). We learn from the
opening of the second *Apology* that the martyrdoms which are recorded
in the second chapter, and the account of which Eusebius here quotes,
happened very shortly before the composition of the *Apology* (<span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.ix.xvii-p13.1"></span>χθὲς δὲ καὶ
πρώην</span>, “yesterday and the day before”).

give the name. In Justin the form <span class="Greek"><span

above.
