<span id="iii.xiii.ix-p3"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xiii.ix-p3.1"></span>Such</span> was the conflict of those
Egyptians who contended nobly for religion in Tyre. But we must admire
those also who suffered martyrdom in their native land; where thousands
of men, women, and children, despising the present life for the sake of
the teaching of our Saviour, endured various deaths.

<span id="iii.xiii.ix-p4"></span>2. Some of them, after scrapings and
rackings and severest scourgings, and numberless other kinds of
tortures, terrible even to hear of, were committed to the flames; some
were drowned in the sea; some offered their heads bravely to those who
cut them off; some died under their tortures, and others perished with
hunger. And yet others were crucified; some according to the method
commonly employed for malefactors; others yet more cruelly, being nailed
to the cross with their heads downward, and being kept alive until they
perished on the cross with hunger.

severely during these years than the territory of the tyrant Maximinus,
who became a Cæsar in 305, and who ruled in Egypt and Syria.
