id="iv.vi.iv.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI</span>.—*Conquest of the
Sarmatians, consequent on the Rebellion of their Slaves.*

<span id="iv.vi.iv.vi-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.vi-p2.1"></span>With</span> respect to the Sarmatians, God
himself brought them beneath the rule of Constantine, and subdued a
nation swelling with barbaric pride in the following manner. Being
attacked by the Scythians, they had entrusted their slaves with arms, in
order to repel the enemy. These slaves first overcame the invaders and
then, turning their weapons against their masters, drove them all from
their native land. The expelled Sarmatians found that their only hope of
safety was in Constantine’s protection: and he, whose familiar habit it
was to save men’s lives, received them all within the confines of the
Roman empire. <span id="fr_3311"></span>[3312](#fn_3311.md) Those who were
capable of serving he incorporated with his own troops: to the rest he
allotted lands to cultivate for their own support: so that they
themselves acknowledged that their past misfortune had produced a happy
result, in that they now enjoyed Roman liberty in place of savage
barbarism. In this manner God added to his dominions many and various
barbaric tribes.
