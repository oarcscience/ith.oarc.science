<span id="iii.xii.xxi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xii.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XX.—</span>*The Festal Epistles of
Dionysius, in which he also gives a Paschal Canon.*

<span id="iii.xii.xxi-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xii.xxi-p2.1"></span>Dionysius</span>, besides his epistles
already mentioned, <span id="fr_2302"></span>[2303](#fn_2302) wrote at
that time <span id="fr_2303"></span>[2304](#fn_2303) also his extant
Festal Epistles, <span id="fr_2304"></span>[2305](#fn_2304) in which he
uses words of panegyric respecting the passover feast. He addressed one
of these to Flavius, <span id="fr_2305"></span>[2306](#fn_2305) and
another to Domitius and Didymus, <span
id="fr_2306"></span>[2307](#fn_2306) in which he sets forth a canon of
eight years, <span id="fr_2307"></span>[2308](#fn_2307) maintaining that
it is not proper to observe the paschal feast until after the vernal
equinox. Besides these he sent another epistle to his fellow-presbyters
in Alexandria, as well as various others to different persons while the
persecution was still prevailing. <span

<span id="iii.xii.xxi-p3"></span> Upon Dionysius of Alexandria, see Bk.
VI. chap. 40, note 1, and see that note for references to the various
passages in which Eusebius mentions or quotes from his epistles.

<span id="fn_2303"></span>[305:2304](2010238.htm#fr_2303) <span
id="iii.xii.xxi-p3.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.xxi-p4"></span> Eusebius supposes all of these
epistles to have been written in the time of Valerian or Gallienus; but
he is mistaken, at least so far as the epistle to Domitius and Didymus
is concerned (see above, chap. 11, note 25), and possibly in regard to
some of the others also.

<span id="fn_2304"></span>[305:2305](2010238.htm#fr_2304) <span
id="iii.xii.xxi-p4.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.xxi-p5"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xii.xxi-p5.1"></span>τὰς φερομένας ἑορταστικ€ς</span>. It was
the custom for the bishops of Alexandria to write every year before
Easter a sort of epistle, or homily, and in it to announce the time of
the festival. These writings thus received the name Festal or Festival
Epistles or Homilies (see Suicer’s *Thesaurus s.v.* <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.xii.xxi-p5.2"></span>ἑ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.xii.xxi-p5.3"></span>ορταστικός</span>, and
Valesius’ note *ad locum*). This is apparently the earliest mention of
such epistles. Others are referred to by Eusebius in chaps. 21 and 22,
as written by Dionysius to various persons. Undoubtedly all the
Alexandrian bishops during these centuries wrote such epistles, but none
are extant, so far as I am aware, except a number by Athanasius (extant
only in a Syriac version, published in Syriac and English by Cureton in
1846 and 1848), a few by Theophilus (extant only in Latin), and thirty
by Cyril (published in Migne’s *Patr. Gr.* LXXVII. 391 sq.).

<span id="fn_2305"></span>[305:2306](2010238.htm#fr_2305) <span
id="iii.xii.xxi-p5.4"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.xxi-p6"></span> Of this Flavius we know nothing. The
epistle addressed to him is no longer extant.

<span id="fn_2306"></span>[305:2307](2010238.htm#fr_2306) <span
id="iii.xii.xxi-p6.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.xxi-p7"></span> On Domitius and Didymus, and the
epistle addressed to them, see above, chap. 11, note 25. Eusebius quotes
from the epistle in that chapter.

<span id="fn_2307"></span>[305:2308](2010238.htm#fr_2307) <span
id="iii.xii.xxi-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.xxi-p8"></span> That is, an eight-year cycle for the
purpose of determining the time of the full moon. Hippolytus had
employed the old eight-year cycle, but had, as he thought, improved it
by combining two in a single sixteen-year cycle (see above, Bk. VI.
chap. 22), as was done also by the author of the so-called Cyprianic
Chronicle at the middle of the third century. The more accurate
nineteen-year Metonic cycle (already in use among the Greeks in the
fifth century <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xii.xxi-p8.1"></span>b.c.</span>) had not come into general use
in the Church until later than this time. The Nicene Council sanctioned
it and gave it wide currency, but it had apparently not yet come into
use in the Church. In fact, the first Christian to make use of it for
the computation of Easter, so far as we know, was Anatolius of
Alexandria, later bishop of Laodicea (see below, chap. 32, §14). It was
soon adopted in the Alexandrian church, and already in the time of
Athanasius had become the basis of all Easter calculations, as we can
gather from Athanasius’ Festal Epistles. From about the time of the
Nicene Council on, Alexandria was commonly looked to for the reckoning
of the date of Easter, and although an older and less accurate cycle
remained in use in the West for a long time, the nineteen-year cycle
gradually won its way everywhere. See Ideler’s great work on chronology,
and cf. Hefele’s *Conciliengesch.* 2d ed. 1. p. 332, and Lightfoot in
the *Dict. of Christ. Biog.* II. p. 313 sq.

<span id="fn_2308"></span>[305:2309](2010238.htm#fr_2308) <span
id="iii.xii.xxi-p8.2"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.xxi-p9"></span> These various epistles are no longer
extant, nor do we know the names of the persons to whom they were
addressed. At least a part of them, if not all, were very likely written
during the Valerian persecution, as Eusebius states, for the fact that
he made a mistake in connection with the epistle to Domitius and Didymus
does not prove that he was in error in regard to all the others as well.
