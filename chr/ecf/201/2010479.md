id="iv.vi.ii.xxxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXIV</span>.—*The Liberation of
Free Persons condemned to labor in the Women’s Apartments, or to
Servitude.*

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xxxiv-p2"></span>“<span class="c13"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.xxxiv-p2.1"></span>Lastly</span>, if any have wrongfully
been deprived of the privileges of noble lineage, and subjected to a
judicial sentence which has consigned them <span id="page_509">p.

apartments <span id="fr_3186"></span>[3187](#fn_3186) and to the linen
making, there to undergo a cruel and miserable labor, or reduced them to
servitude for the benefit of the public treasury, without any exemption
on the ground of superior birth; let such persons, resuming the honors
they had previously enjoyed, and their proper dignities, henceforward
exult in the blessings of liberty, and lead a glad life. Let the free
man, <span id="fr_3187"></span>[3188](#fn_3187) too, by some injustice
and inhumanity, or even madness, made a slave, who has felt the sudden
transition from liberty to bondage, and ofttimes bewailed his unwonted
labors, return to his family once more a free man in virtue of this our
ordinance, and seek those employments which befit a state of freedom;
and let him dismiss from his remembrance those services which he found
so oppressive, and which so ill became his condition.
