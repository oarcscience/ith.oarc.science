under Domitian.*

<span id="iii.viii.xvii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.viii.xvii-p2.1"></span>Domitian</span>, having shown great
cruelty toward many, and having unjustly put to death no small number of
well-born and notable men at Rome, and having without cause exiled and
confiscated the property of a great many other illustrious men, finally
became a successor of Nero in his hatred and enmity toward God. He was
in fact the second that stirred up a persecution against us, <span
id="fr_710"></span>[711](#fn_710.md) although his father Vespasian had
undertaken nothing prejudicial to us. <span

<span id="iii.viii.xvii-p3"></span> The persecutions under Nero and
Domitian were not undertaken by the state as such; they were simply
personal matters, and established no precedent as to the conduct of the
state toward Christianity. They were rather spasmodic outbursts of
personal enmity, but were looked upon with great horror as the first to
which the Church was subjected. There was no general persecution, which
took in all parts of the empire, until the reign of Decius (249–251),
but Domitian’s cruelty and ferocity were extreme, and many persons of
the highest rank fell under his condemnation and suffered banishment and
even death, not especially on account of Christianity, though there were
Christians among them, but on account of his jealousy, and for political
reasons of various sorts. That Domitian’s persecution of the Christians
was not of long duration is testified by Tertullian, *Apol.* 5. Upon the
persecutions of the Christians, see, among other works, Wieseler’s *Die
Christenverfolgungen der Cäsaren, hist. und chronolog. untersucht,*
1878; Uhlhorn’s *Der Kampf des Christenthums mit dem Heidenthum,*
English translation by Smyth and Ropes, 1879; and especially the keen
essay of Overbeck, *Gesetze der römischen Kaiser gegen die Christen,* in
his *Studien zur Gesch. der alten Kirche,* I. (1875).

<span id="iii.viii.xvii-p4"></span> The fact that the Christians were
not persecuted by Vespasian is abundantly confirmed by the absence of
any tradition to the opposite effect. Compare Tertullian’s *Apol.* chap.
5, where the persecutions of Nero and Domitian are recorded.
