<span id="iv.vi.ii.xxxv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.xxxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXV</span>.—*Of the Inheritance
of the Property of Martyrs and Confessors, also of those who had
suffered Banishment or Confiscation of Property.*

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xxxv-p2"></span>“<span class="c13"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.xxxv-p2.1"></span>Nor</span> must we omit to notice those
estates of which individuals have been deprived on various pretenses.
For if any of those who have engaged with dauntless and resolute
determination in the noble and divine conflict of martyrdom have also
been stripped of their fortunes; or if the same has been the lot of the
confessors, who have won for themselves the hope of eternal treasures;
or if the loss of property has befallen those who were driven from their
native land because they would not yield to the persecutors, and betray
their faith; lastly, if any who have escaped the sentence of death have
yet been despoiled of their worldly goods; we ordain that the
inheritances of all such persons be transferred to their nearest
kindred. And whereas the laws expressly assign this right to those most
nearly related, it will be easy to ascertain to whom these inheritances
severally belong. And it is evidently reasonable that the succession in
these cases should belong to those who would have stood in the place of
nearest affinity, had the deceased experienced a natural death.
