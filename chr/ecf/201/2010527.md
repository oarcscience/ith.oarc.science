<span id="iv.vi.iii.viii-Page_522"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VIII</span>.—*That the Assembly
was composed, as in the Acts of the Apostles, of Individuals from
Various Nations.*

<span id="iv.vi.iii.viii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.viii-p2.1"></span>For</span> it is said <span
id="fr_3242"></span>[3243](#fn_3242) that in the Apostles’ age, there
were gathered “devout men from every nation under heaven”; among whom
were Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in
Mesopotamia, in Judea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus and Asia, in Phrygia
and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and the parts of Libya about Cyrene; and
sojourners from Rome, both Jews and proselytes, Cretans and Arabians.
But that assembly was less, in that not all who composed it were
ministers of God; but in the present company, the number of bishops
exceeded two hundred and fifty, <span
id="fr_3243"></span>[3244](#fn_3243) while that of the presbyters and
deacons in their train, and the crowd of acolytes and other attendants
was altogether beyond computation.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.viii-p4"></span> The number present is given
variously as three hundred (Socrates), three hundred and eighteen
(Athanasius, &c.), two hundred and seventy (Theodoret), or even two
thousand (cf. Hefele). It has been conjectured that the variation came
from the omission of names of the Arians (cf. note of Heinichen, Vol. 3,
p. 506–507), or that it varied during the two months and more.
