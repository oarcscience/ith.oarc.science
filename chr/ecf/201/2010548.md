<span id="iv.vi.iii.xxix-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.xxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIX</span>.—*How he wrote
concerning the Erection of a Church, both to the Governors of the
Provinces, and to the Bishop Macarius.*

<span id="iv.vi.iii.xxix-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.xxix-p2.1"></span>Immediately</span> after the
transactions I have recorded, the emperor sent forth injunctions which
breathed a truly pious spirit, at the same time granting ample supplies
of money, and commanding that a house of prayer worthy of the worship of
God should be erected near the Saviour’s tomb on a scale of rich and
royal greatness. This object he had indeed for some time kept in view,
and had foreseen, as if by the aid of a superior intelligence, that
which should afterwards come to pass. He laid his commands, therefore,
on the governors of the Eastern provinces, that by an abundant and
unsparing expenditure they should secure the completion of the work on a
scale of noble and ample magnificence. He also despatched the following
letter to the bishop who at that time presided over the church at
Jerusalem, in which he clearly asserted the saving doctrine of the
faith, writing in these terms.
