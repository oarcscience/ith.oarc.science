<span id="iv.vi.i.xxxi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.xxxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXI</span>.—*A Description of the
Standard of the Cross, which the Romans now call the Labarum.* <span
id="fr_3109"></span>[3110](#fn_3109.md)

<span id="iv.vi.i.xxxi-p3"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.xxxi-p3.1"></span>Now</span> it was made in the following
manner. A long spear, overlaid with gold, formed the <span
id="page_491">p. 491</span> <span
id="iv.vi.i.xxxi-Page_491"></span>figure of the cross by means of a
transverse bar laid over it. On the top of the whole was fixed a wreath
of gold and precious stones; and within this, <span
id="fr_3110"></span>[3111](#fn_3110.md) the symbol of the Saviour’s name,
two letters indicating the name of Christ by means of its initial
characters, the letter P being intersected by X in its centre: <span
id="fr_3111"></span>[3112](#fn_3111.md) and these letters the emperor was
in the habit of wearing on his helmet at a later period. From the
cross-bar of the spear was suspended a cloth, <span
id="fr_3112"></span>[3113](#fn_3112.md) a royal piece, covered with a
profuse embroidery of most brilliant precious stones; and which, being
also richly interlaced with gold, presented an indescribable degree of
beauty to the beholder. This banner was of a square form, and the
upright staff, whose lower section was of great length, <span
id="fr_3113"></span>[3114](#fn_3113.md) bore a golden half-length
portrait <span id="fr_3114"></span>[3115](#fn_3114.md) of the pious emperor
and his children on its upper part, beneath the trophy of the cross, and
immediately above the embroidered banner.

<span id="iv.vi.i.xxxi-p9"></span>The emperor constantly made use of
this sign of salvation as a safeguard against every adverse and hostile
power, and commanded that others similar to it should be carried at the
head of all his armies.

or from *labarva,* which, in the Basque language, still signifies a
standard.—Riddle’s *Lat. Dict.* voc. *Labarum.* Gibbon declares the
derivation and meaning of the word to be “totally unknown, in spite of
the efforts of the critics, who have ineffectually tortured the Latin,
Greek, Spanish, Celtic, Teutonic, Illyric, Armenian, &c., in search of
an etymology.”—*Decline and Fall,* chap. 22, note 33.—*Bag.*\] Compare

<span id="iv.vi.i.xxxi-p4"></span> Thus rather than “on.” Compare cuts
in article of Venables. “It \[the monogram of Christ\] is often set
within a crown or palm branch.”—*Wolcott, Sacred Archæalogy*, p. 390.

<span id="iv.vi.i.xxxi-p6"></span> That this was no new invention of
Constantine may be seen by comparing the following description of an
ordinary Roman standard, “…each cohort had for its own ensign the
serpent or dragon, which was woven on a square piece of cloth, elevated
on a gilt staff, to which a cross-bar was adapted for the purpose…under
the eagle or other emblem was often placed a head of the reigning
emperor.” Yates, art. *Signa militaria,* in Smith, *Dict. Gr. and Rom.
Ant.* (1878), 1044–1045.

great length.”—*Bag.,* according to suggestion of Valesius of a possible
meaning, but better as above, meaning the part below the cross-bar. So
