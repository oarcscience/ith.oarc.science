<p class="endnote"><a name="iii.ix.xii-p4"></A> That is, Marcus Aurelius, whose original name was Marcus Annius Verus, but who, after his adoption by the Emperor Antoninus Pius, was styled Marcus &AElig;lius Aurelius Verus C&aelig;sar. As a tribute to his sincerity and truthfulness, he was quite commonly called, instead of <i>Verus</i>, <i>Verissimus</i>.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="iii.ix.xii-p5"></A> The <span class="c13"><a name="iii.ix.xii-p5.1"></A>mss</span>. are divided here between the forms &#966;&#953;&#955;&#959;&#963;&#8057;&#966;&#969; and &#966;&#953;&#955;&#959;&#963;&#8057;&#966;&#959;&#965;. If the former reading be followed, we must translate, &#8220;to Lucius, own son of C&aelig;sar the philosopher.&#8221; The <span class="c13"><a name="iii.ix.xii-p5.2"></A>mss</span>. are about equally divided, and the latter reading is adopted by Stephanus, Valesius, Stroth, and Burton. But our <span class="c13"><a name="iii.ix.xii-p5.3"></A>mss</span>. of Justin support the former reading, which is adopted by Schwegler and Heinichen, and which, as the latter remarks, is far more natural than the other reading, for Justin had greater reason for giving the appellation of &#8220;philosopher&#8221; to a C&aelig;sar who was still living, even though he may not have been noted for his philosophical tastes, than to a C&aelig;sar who was already dead, and whose character certainly entitled him to the appellation no more than, if as much as, his son. See Heinichen&#146;s note <i>in loco</i>, and Otto&#146;s note in his edition of Justin&#146;s works, Vol. I. p. 3. ff. The Lucius addressed here was Lucius Ceionius Commodus, whose father, bearing the same name, had been adopted as C&aelig;sar by Hadrian. The younger Lucius was adopted as C&aelig;sar along with Marcus by Antoninus Pius, and later became Marcus&#146; colleague in the empire, when he added to his own name the name Verus, which Marcus had formerly borne. He is therefore commonly known in history as Lucius Verus (see the respective articles in Smith&#146;s <i>Dict. of Greek and Roman Biog</i>.).</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="iii.ix.xii-p7"></A> This &#8220;Assembly of Asia&#8221; (&#964;&#8056; &#954;&#959;&#953;&#957;&#8056;&#957; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#8125;&#913;&#963;&#8055;&#945;&#962;) was one of the regular provincial diets which Augustus had called into being as fixed institutions. It was an annual assembly of the civic deputies of the province, and served as a general organ of the province, especially in bringing the wishes of the people to the knowledge of the governor, and through him to the emperor, and decrees of the emperor were often addressed to it, and legates chosen by it were sent to the emperor whenever occasion required. See Marquardt, <i>R&ouml;m. Staatsverwaltung</i>, I. p. 366. sq.</p>
