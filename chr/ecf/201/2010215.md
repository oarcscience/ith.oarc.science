<span id="iii.xi.xlv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xi.xlv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLV.—</span>*An Epistle of Dionysius
to Novatus.*

<span id="iii.xi.xlv-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xi.xlv-p2.1"></span>But</span> let us see how the same man
addressed Novatus <span id="fr_2140"></span>[2141](#fn_2140) when he was
disturbing the Roman brotherhood. As he pretended that some of the
brethren were the occasion of his apostasy and schism, as if he had been
forced by them to proceed as he had, <span
id="fr_2141"></span>[2142](#fn_2141) observe the manner in which he
writes to him:

<span id="iii.xi.xlv-p5"></span>2. “Dionysius to his brother Novatus,
greeting. If, as thou sayest, thou hast been led on unwillingly, thou
wilt prove this if thou retirest willingly. For it were better to suffer
everything, rather than divide the Church of God. Even martyrdom for the
sake of preventing division would not be less glorious than for refusing
to worship idols. Nay, to me it seems greater. For in the one case a man
suffers martyrdom <span id="page_291">p. 291</span> <span
id="iii.xi.xlv-Page_291"></span>for the sake of his own soul; in the
other case in behalf of the entire Church. And now if thou canst
persuade or induce the brethren to come to unanimity, thy righteousness
will be greater than thine error, and this will not be counted, but that
will be praised. But if thou canst not prevail with the disobedient, at
least save thine own soul. I pray that thou mayst fare well, maintaining
peace in the Lord.” This he wrote to Novatus.

<span id="iii.xi.xlv-p3"></span> This epistle to Novatian was doubtless
written in reply to a letter from him announcing his election to the
episcopate of Rome, for we know that Novatian sent such letters, as was
customary, to all the prominent bishops of the Church. Dionysius’
epistle, therefore, must have been written soon after the election of
Novatian, which took place in the year 251. We have only the fragment
quoted in this chapter.

<span id="fn_2141"></span>[290:2142](2010215.htm#fr_2141) <span
id="iii.xi.xlv-p3.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xi.xlv-p4"></span> Novatian may well have been urged
against his will to permit himself to be made opposition bishop; but of
course, once having taken the step, so long as he believed in the
justice of the cause for which he was contending, he could not turn
back, but must maintain his position with vigor and firmness. This, of
course, would lead his enemies to believe that he had himself sought the
position, as Dionysius evidently believed that he had.
