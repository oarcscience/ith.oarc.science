the heretical teachings of Sabellius, <span

prominent, and says:

<span id="iii.xii.vii-p5"></span>“For concerning the doctrine now
agitated in Ptolemais of Pentapolis,—which is impious and marked by
great blasphemy against the Almighty God, the Father, and our Lord Jesus
Christ, and contains much unbelief respecting his Only Begotten Son and
the first-born of every creature, the Word which became man, and a want
of perception of the Holy Spirit,—as there came to me communications
from both sides and brethren discussing the matter, I wrote certain
letters treating the subject as instructively as, by the help. of God, I
was able. <span id="fr_2183"></span>[2184](#fn_2183.md) Of these I
send <span id="fr_2184"></span>[2185](#fn_2184.md) thee copies.”

<span id="iii.xii.vii-p3"></span> Of the life of Sabellius we know very
little. He was at the head of the Monarchian (modalistic) party in Rome
during the episcopate of Zephyrinus (198–217), and was there perhaps
even earlier. He is, and was already in the fourth century, commonly
called a native of Africa, but the first one directly to state this is
Basil, and the opinion seems to rest upon the fact that his views were
especially popular in Pentapolis as early as the middle of the third
century, as Dionysius says here. Hippolytus in speaking of him does not
mention his birthplace, which causes Stokes to incline to the opinion
that he was a native of Rome. The matter, in fact, cannot be decided. We
are told by Hippolytus that Callistus led Sabellius into heresy, but
that after he became pope he excommunicated him in order to gain a
reputation for orthodoxy. Of the later life of Sabellius we know
nothing. His writings are no longer extant, though there are apparently
quotations from some of them in Epiphanius, *Hær.* 62, and Athanasius,
*Contra Arian. Oratio* 4.

<span id="iii.xii.vii-p4"></span>In the third century those Monarchians
(modalists) who were known as Patripassians in the West were called
Sabellians in the East. In the fourth and fifth centuries the Fathers
used the term Sabellianism in a general sense for various forms of
Monarchianism, all of which, however, tended in the one direction, viz.
toward the denial of any personal distinction in the Godhead, and hence
the identification of Father and Son. And so we characterize every
teaching which tends that way as Sabellianistic, although this form of
Monarchianism is really much older than Sabellius. See Harnack’s article
on Monarchianism in Herzog, 2d ed. (abridged translation in
Schaff-Herzog), and Stokes’ article on Sabellius and Sabellianism in the
*Dict. of Christ. Biog.,* both of which give the literature, and
Schaff’s *Ch. Hist.* II. p. 580 sqq., which gives the sources in full.
Neander’s account deserves especial notice. Upon Eusebius’ attitude
toward Sabellianism, see above, p. 13 sq.

Of these letters no fragments are extant. They are not to be confounded
with the four books against Sabellius, addressed to Dionysius of Rome,
and mentioned in chap. 26, below. It is possible, as Dittrich suggests,
that they included the letters on the same subject to Ammon,
Telesphorus, Euphranor, and others which Eusebius mentions in that
chapter. Upon Dionysius’ attitude toward Sabellianism, see above, Bk.
VI. chap. 40, note 1.

id="iii.xii.vii-p7.1"></span>ž</span><span class="Greek"><span

here does not refer to a past time, but to the time of the writing of
the letter, which is past when the person to whom the letter is sent
reads the words. The same word (<span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xii.vii-p7.3"></span>ž</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xii.vii-p7.4"></span>πεμψα</span>) is used in this sense in
