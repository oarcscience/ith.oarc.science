<span id="iv.vi.i.xxix-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.xxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIX</span>.—*How the Christ of
God appeared to him in his Sleep, and commanded him to use in his Wars a
Standard made in the Form of the Cross.*

<span id="iv.vi.i.xxix-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.xxix-p2.1"></span>He</span> said, moreover, that he doubted
within himself what the import of this apparition could be. And while he
continued to ponder and reason on its meaning, night suddenly came on;
then in his sleep the Christ of God appeared to him with the same sign
which he had seen in the heavens, and commanded him to make a likeness
of that sign which he had seen in the heavens, and to use it as a
safeguard in all engagements with his enemies.
