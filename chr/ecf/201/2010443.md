<span id="iv.vi.i.lviii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.lviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter LVIII</span>.—*That Maximin, who
had persecuted the Christians, was compelled to fly, and conceal himself
in the Disguise of a Slave.*

<span id="iv.vi.i.lviii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.lviii-p2.1"></span>Such</span> was the punishment which he
underwent who had commenced the persecution. He, <span
id="fr_3156"></span>[3157](#fn_3156.md) however, of whom we are now
speaking, who had been a witness of these things, and known them by his
own actual experience, all at once banished the remembrance of them from
his mind, and reflected neither on the punishment of the first, nor the
divine judgment which had been executed on the second persecutor. <span
id="fr_3157"></span>[3158](#fn_3157.md) The latter had indeed endeavored to
outstrip his predecessor in the career of crime, and prided himself on
the invention of new tortures for us. Fire nor sword, nor piercing with
nails, nor yet wild beasts or the depths of the sea sufficed him. In
addition to all these, he discovered a new mode of punishment, and
issued an edict directing that their eyesight should be destroyed. So
that numbers, not of men only, but of women and children, after being
deprived of the sight of their eyes, and the use of the joints of their
feet, by mutilation or cauterization, were consigned in this condition
to the painful labor of the mines. Hence it was that this tyrant also
was overtaken not long after by the righteous judgment of God, at a time
when, confiding in the aid of the demons whom he worshiped as gods, and
relying on the countless multitudes of his troops, he had ventured to
engage in battle. For, feeling himself on that occasion destitute of all
hope in God, he threw from him the imperial dress which so ill became
him, hid himself with unmanly timidity in the crowd around him, and
sought safety in flight. <span id="fr_3158"></span>[3159](#fn_3158.md)

<span id="iv.vi.i.lviii-p6"></span>He afterwards lurked about the fields
and villages in the habit of a slave, hoping he should thus be
effectually concealed. He had not, however, eluded the mighty and
all-searching eye of God: for even while he was expecting to pass the
residue of his days in security, he fell prostrate, smitten by God’s
fiery dart, and his whole body consumed by the stroke of Divine
vengeance; so that all trace of the original lineaments of his person
was lost, and nothing remained to him but dry bones and a skeleton-like
appearance.
