<span id="iii.x.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.x.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI.—</span>*Clement of Alexandria.*

<span id="iii.x.xii-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.x.xii-p2.1"></span>At</span> this time Clement, <span
id="fr_1515"></span>[1516](#fn_1515.md) being trained with him <span
id="fr_1516"></span>[1517](#fn_1516.md) in the divine Scriptures at
Alexandria, became well known. He had the same name as the one who
anciently was at the head of the Roman church, and who was a disciple of
the apostles. <span id="fr_1517"></span>[1518](#fn_1517.md)

<span id="iii.x.xii-p6"></span>2. In his Hypotyposes <span
id="fr_1518"></span>[1519](#fn_1518.md) he speaks of Pantænus by name as
his teacher. It seems to me that he alludes to the same person also in
the first book of his Stromata, when, referring to the more conspicuous
of the successors of the apostles whom he had met, <span
id="fr_1519"></span>[1520](#fn_1519.md) he says: <span
id="fr_1520"></span>[1521](#fn_1520.md)

<span id="iii.x.xii-p10"></span>3. “This work <span
id="fr_1521"></span>[1522](#fn_1521.md) is not a writing artfully
constructed for display; but my notes are stored up for old age, as a
remedy against forgetfulness; an image without art, and a rough sketch
of those powerful and animated words which it was my privilege to hear,
as well as of blessed and truly remarkable men.

<span id="iii.x.xii-p12"></span>4. Of these the one—the Ionian <span
id="fr_1522"></span>[1523](#fn_1522.md) —was in <span id="page_226">p.
226</span> <span id="iii.x.xii-Page_226"></span>Greece, the other in
Magna Græcia; <span id="fr_1523"></span>[1524](#fn_1523.md) the one of them
was from Cœle-Syria, <span id="fr_1524"></span>[1525](#fn_1524.md) the
other from Egypt. There were others in the East, one of them an
Assyrian, <span id="fr_1525"></span>[1526](#fn_1525.md) the other a Hebrew
in Palestine. <span id="fr_1526"></span>[1527](#fn_1526.md) But when I met
with the last, <span id="fr_1527"></span>[1528](#fn_1527.md) —in ability
truly he was first,—having hunted him out in his concealment in Egypt, I
found rest.

<span id="iii.x.xii-p19"></span>5. These men, preserving the true
tradition of the blessed doctrine, directly from the holy apostles,
Peter and James and John and Paul, the son receiving it from the father
(but few were like the fathers), have come by God’s will even to us to
deposit those ancestral and apostolic seeds.” <span

<span id="fn_1515"></span>[225:1516](2010152.htm#fr_1515.md) <span
id="iii.x.xii-p2.2"></span>

<span id="iii.x.xii-p3"></span> Of the place and time of Titus Flavius
Clement’s birth we have no certain knowledge, though it is probable that
he was an Athenian by training at least, if not by birth, and he must
have been born about the middle of the second century. He received a
very extensive education, and became a Christian in adult years, after
he had tried various systems of philosophy, much as Justin Martyr had.
He had a great thirst for knowledge, and names six different teachers
under whom he studied Christianity (see below, §4). Finally he became a
pupil of Pantænus in Alexandria, whom he afterward succeeded as the head
of the catechetical school there. It is at this time (about 190 <span
class="c13"><span id="iii.x.xii-p3.1"></span>a.d.</span>) that he comes
out clearly into the light of history, and to this period (190–202)
belongs his greatest literary activity. He was at the head of the school
probably until 202, when the persecution of Severus having broken out,
he left Alexandria, and we nave no notice that he ever returned. That he
did not leave Alexandria dishonorably, through fear, may be gathered
from his presence with Alexander during his imprisonment, and from the
letters of the latter (see below, Bk. VI. chaps. 11 and 14, and cf. Bk.
VI. chap. 6, notes). This is the last notice that we have of him (<span
class="c13"><span id="iii.x.xii-p3.2"></span>a.d.</span> 212); and of
the place and time of his death we know nothing, though he cannot have
lived many years after this. He was never a bishop, but was a presbyter
of the Alexandrian church, and was in ancient times commemorated as a
saint, but his name was dropped from the roll by Clement VIII. on
account of suspected heterodoxy. He lived in an age of transition, and
his great importance lies in the fact that he completed the bond between
Hellenism and Christianity, and as a follower of the apologists
established Christianity as a philosophy, and yet not as they had done
in an apologetic sense. He was the teacher of Origen, and the real
father of Greek theology. He published no system, as did Origen; his
works were rather desultory and fragmentary, but full of wide and varied
learning, and exhibit a truly broad and catholic spirit. Upon his works,
see Bk. VI. chap. 13. Upon Clement, see especially Westcott’s article in
Smith and Wace, I. 559–567, and Schaff, II. 781–785, where the
literature is given with considerable fullness. For an able and popular
presentation of his theology, see Allen’s *Continuity of Christian
Thought*, p. 38–70.

not been preserved. Eusebius repeats the same statement in Bk. VI. chap.
13, §1.

id="iii.x.xii-p8.1"></span>τοὺς ἐμφανεστέρους ἧς κατείληφεν ἀπόστολικῆς
διαδοχῆς ἐπισημαινόμενος</span>. Rufinus reads *apostolicæ
prædicationis* instead of *successionis*. And so Christophorsonus and
Valesius adopt <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.x.xii-p8.2"></span>διδαχῆς</span> instead of <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.x.xii-p8.3"></span>διαδοχῆς</span>, and
translate *doctrinæ*. But <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.x.xii-p8.4"></span>διαδοχῆς</span> is too well supported by
<span class="c13"><span id="iii.x.xii-p8.5"></span>ms.</span> authority
to be rejected; and though the use of the abstract “succession,” instead
of the concrete “successors,” seems harsh, it is employed elsewhere in
the same sense by Eusebius (see Bk. I. chap. 1, §1).

<span id="fn_1520"></span>[225:1521](2010152.htm#fr_1520.md) <span

<span id="iii.x.xii-p11"></span> i.e. his *Stromata*.

<span id="fn_1522"></span>[225:1523](2010152.htm#fr_1522.md) <span
id="iii.x.xii-p12.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.xii-p13"></span> This is hardly a proper name, although
many have so considered it, for Clement gives no other proper name in
this connection, and it is much more natural to translate “the Ionian.”
Various conjectures have been made as to who these teachers were, but
none are more than mere guesses. Philip of Side tells us that
Athenagoras was a teacher of Clement, but, as we have seen, no
confidence can be placed in his statement. It has been conjectured also
that Melito may be the person referred to as “the Ionian,” for Clement
mentions his works, and wrote a book on the paschal question in reply to
Melito’s work on the same subject (see above, Bk. IV. chap. 26, note
23). This too, however, is mere conjecture.

<span id="fn_1523"></span>[226:1524](2010152.htm#fr_1523.md) <span
id="iii.x.xii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.xii-p14"></span> The lower part of the peninsula of
Italy was called Magna Græcia, because it contained so many Greek
colonies.

<span id="fn_1524"></span>[226:1525](2010152.htm#fr_1524.md) <span
id="iii.x.xii-p14.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.xii-p15"></span> Cœle-Syria was the valley lying between
the eastern and western ranges of Lebanon.

<span id="fn_1525"></span>[226:1526](2010152.htm#fr_1525.md) <span
id="iii.x.xii-p15.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.xii-p16"></span> This has been conjectured to be Tatian.
But in the first place, Clement, in *Strom.* III. 12, calls Tatian a
Syrian instead of an Assyrian (the terms are indeed often used
interchangeably, but we should nevertheless hardly expect Clement to
call his own teacher in one place a Syrian, in another an Assyrian). And
again, in II. 12, he speaks very harshly of Tatian, and could hardly
have referred to him in this place in such terms of respect and
affection.

<span id="fn_1526"></span>[226:1527](2010152.htm#fr_1526.md) <span
id="iii.x.xii-p16.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.xii-p17"></span> Various conjectures have been made as
to the identity of this teacher,—for instance, Theophilus of Cæsarea
(who, however, was never called a Hebrew, according to Valesius), and
Theodotus (so Valesius).

<span id="fn_1527"></span>[226:1528](2010152.htm#fr_1527.md) <span
id="iii.x.xii-p17.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.xii-p18"></span> Pantænus. There can be no doubt as to
his identity, for Clement says that he remained with him and sought no
further. Eusebius omits a sentence here in which Clement calls Pantænus
the “Sicilian bee,” from which it is generally concluded that he was a
native of Sicily (see the previous chapter, note 1).

<span id="fn_1528"></span>[226:1529](2010152.htm#fr_1528.md) <span
id="iii.x.xii-p19.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.xii-p20"></span> This entire passage is very important,
as showing not only the extensiveness of Clement’s own acquaintance with
Christians, but also the close intercourse of Christians in general,
both East and West. Clement’s statement in regard to the directness with
which he received apostolic tradition is not definite, and he by no
means asserts that his teachers were hearers of the apostles (which in
itself would not be impossible, but Clement would certainly have spoken
more clearly had it been a fact), nor indeed that they were hearers of
disciples of the apostles. But among so many teachers, so widely
scattered, he could hardly have failed to meet with some who had at
least known those who had known the apostles. In any case he considers
his teachers very near the apostles as regards the accuracy of their
traditions.

<span id="iii.x.xii-p21"></span>The passage is also interesting, as
showing the uniformity of doctrine in different parts of Christendom,
according to Clement’s view, though this does not prove much, as Clement
himself was so liberal and so much of an eclectic. It is also
interesting, as showing how much weight Clement laid upon tradition, how
completely he rested upon it for the truth, although at the same time he
was so free and broad in his speculation.
