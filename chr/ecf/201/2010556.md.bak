id="iv.vi.iii.xxxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXVII</span>.—*Description of
the Double Porticos on Either Side, and of the Three Eastern Gates.*

<span id="iv.vi.iii.xxxvii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.xxxvii-p2.1"></span>Besides</span> this were two porticos
on each side, with upper and lower ranges of pillars, <span
id="fr_3267"></span>[3268](#fn_3267.md) corresponding in length with the
church itself; and these also had their roofs ornamented with gold. Of
these porticos, those which were exterior to the church were supported
by columns of great size, while those within these rested on piles <span
id="fr_3268"></span>[3269](#fn_3268.md) of <span id="page_530">p.
530</span> <span id="iv.vi.iii.xxxvii-Page_530"></span>stone beautifully
adorned on the surface. Three gates, placed exactly east, were intended
to receive the multitudes who entered the church.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.xxxvii-p3"></span> Whether this means two series,
one underground and one above (*Molz.* and many), or not, is fully
discussed by Heinichen in a separate note (*Eusebius,* vol. 3, p.
520–521).

<span id="iv.vi.iii.xxxvii-p4"></span> \[These inner porticos seem to
have rested on massy piles, because they adjoined the sides of the
church, and had to bear its roof, which was loftier than any of the
rest.—*Bag.*\] Translated by *Molz.* “Quadrangular supports.” “In
Architecture *a cubic mass of building,* to serve for
bearings.”—*Liddell and Scott.*
