id="iv.vi.ii.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XV</span>.—*Treacherous Friendship,
and Idolatrous Practices of Licinius.*

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.xv-p2.1"></span>And</span> inasmuch as he who had lately
fled before him now dissembled his real sentiments, and again petitioned
for a renewal of friendship and alliance, the emperor thought fit, on
certain conditions, to grant his request, <span
id="fr_3174"></span>[3175](#fn_3174) in the hope that such a measure
might be expedient, and generally advantageous to the community.
Licinius, however, while he pretended a ready submission to the terms
prescribed, and attested his sincerity by oaths, at this very time was
secretly engaged in collecting a military force, and again meditated war
and strife, inviting even the barbarians to join his standard, <span
id="fr_3175"></span>[3176](#fn_3175) and he began also to look about him
for other gods, having been deceived by those in whom he had hitherto
trusted. And, without bestowing a thought on what he had himself
publicly spoken on the subject of false deities, or choosing to
acknowledge that God who had fought on the side of Constantine, he made
himself ridiculous by seeking for a multitude of new gods.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xv-p3"></span> \[“He consented to leave his rival,
or, as he again styled Licinius, his friend and brother, in the
possession of Thrace, Asia Minor, Syria, and Egypt; but the provinces of
Pannonia, Dalmatia, Dacia, Macedonia, and Greece, were yielded to the
Western empire, and the dominions of Constantine now extended from the
confines of Caledonia to the extremity of Peloponnesus.”—Gibbon,
*Decline and Fall,* chap. XIV.—*Bag.*\]

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xv-p4"></span> \[Gibbon (chap. XIV.) says that the
reconciliation of Constantine and Licinius maintained, *above eight
years,* the tranquillity of the Roman world. If this be true, it may be
regarded as one proof that our author’s work is rather to be considered
as a general sketch of Constantine’s life and character than as a
minutely correct historical document.—*Bag.*\] There is either a strange
lack of perspective in this account, or else Eusebius omits all account
of the first wars with Licinius (314) which resulted in the division of
territory mentioned in the above note. This latter view is plausible on
comparison with the account in the *Church History.* In this view the
conditions referred to above relate to the terms on which Licinius was
spared on Constantia’s request, and what follows is the explanation of
the alleged oath-breaking of Constantine in putting Licinius to death.
