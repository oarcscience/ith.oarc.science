<span id="iii.xv.iv-p3"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xv.iv-p3.1"></span>1. The</span>fact that this man, who took the
lead in this matter, had succeeded in his purpose was an incitement to
all the other officials in the cities under the same government to
prepare a similar memorial. <span id="fr_2727"></span>[2728](#fn_2727.md)
And the governors of the provinces perceiving that this was agreeable to
the emperor suggested to their subjects that they should do the same.

<span id="iii.xv.iv-p5"></span>2. And as the tyrant by a rescript
declared himself well pleased with their measures, <span
id="fr_2728"></span>[2729](#fn_2728.md) persecution was kindled anew
against us. Priests for the images were then appointed in the cities,
and besides them high priests by Maximinus himself. <span
id="fr_2729"></span>[2730](#fn_2729.md) The latter were taken from among
those who were most distinguished in public life and had gained
celebrity in all the offices which they had filled; and who were imbued,
moreover, with great zeal for the service of those whom they worshiped.

<span id="iii.xv.iv-p8"></span>3. Indeed, the extraordinary superstition
of the emperor, to speak in brief, led all his subjects, both rulers and
private citizens, for the sake of gratifying him, to do everything
against us, supposing that they could best show their gratitude to him
for the benefits which they had received from him, by plotting murder
against us and exhibiting toward us any new signs of malignity.

<span id="iii.xv.iv-p7"></span> Lactantius (*ibid.* chap. 36) says: “In
compliance with those addresses he \[Maximinus\] introduced a new mode
of government in things respecting religion, and for each city he
created a high priest, chosen from among the persons of most
distinction. The office of those men was to make daily sacrifices to all
their gods, and, with the aid of the former priests, to prevent the
Christians from erecting churches, or from worshiping God, either
publicly or in private; and he authorized them to compel the Christians
to sacrifice to idols, and, on their refusal, to bring them before the
civil magistrate; and, as if this had not been enough, in every province
he established a superintendent priest, one of chief eminence in the
state; and he commanded that all those priests newly instituted should
appear in white habits, that being the most honorable distinction of
dress.” Maximin perceived the power that existed in the Catholic Church
with its wonderful organization, and conceived the stupendous idea of
rejuvenating paganism by creating a pagan Catholic Church. The Roman
religion should cease to be the loose, unorganized, chaotic thing it had
always been, and should be made a positive aggressive power over against
Christianity by giving it a regular organization and placing the entire
institution in the hands of honorable and able men, whose business it
should be to increase its stability and power in every way and in all
quarters. We are compelled to admire the wisdom of Maximin’s plan. No
persecutor before him had ever seen the need of thus replacing the
Christian Church by another institution as great and as splendid as
itself. The effort, like that of Julian a half-century later, must
remain memorable in the annals of the conflict of paganism with
Christianity.
