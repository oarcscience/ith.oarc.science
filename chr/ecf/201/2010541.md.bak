Some, and wrote Letters to Others; also his Presents.*

<span id="iv.vi.iii.xxii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span

success, the emperor presented as it were pleasant fruits in the way of
letters to those who had not been present at the council. He commanded
also that ample gifts of money should be bestowed on all the people,
both in the country and the cities, being pleased thus to honor the
festive occasion of the twentieth anniversary of his reign.
