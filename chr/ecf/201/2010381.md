<span id="iv.iv.ii-p2"></span>The *Editions* and *Translations* of this
work are substantially identical with those of the Life. See above,
under *Life*. The *Authenticity* of the work has been doubted, and its
composition ascribed to Eusebius or some other Christian writer, but
without sufficient reason. It was appended by Eusebius to his Life of
Constantine as specimens of the latter’s style (cf. *V.C.* 4. 32). As
such it shows a man of some learning, though learning taken at second
hand, it is thought, from Lactantius and others (cf. Wordsworth’s
Constantine I.). It was composed in Latin, and translated into Greek by
the special officials appointed for such work (*V.C.* 4. 32). It was
delivered on Good Friday, but in what year or where is not known. It has
been placed before the year 324 (Ceiller, 130), but the mention of
events and the character of the work itself suggest a considerably later
date.
