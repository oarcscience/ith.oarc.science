<span id="iii.xi.xxxii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xi.xxxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXII.—</span>*The Commentaries
which Origen composed in Cæsarea in Palestine.*

<span id="iii.xi.xxxii-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xi.xxxii-p2.1"></span>About</span> this time Origen prepared his
Commentaries on Isaiah <span id="fr_2025"></span>[2026](#fn_2025.md) and on
Ezekiel. <span id="fr_2026"></span>[2027](#fn_2026.md) Of the former there
have come down to us thirty books, as far as the third part of Isaiah,
to the vision of the beasts in the desert; <span
id="fr_2027"></span>[2028](#fn_2027.md) on Ezekiel twenty-five books, which
are all that he wrote on the whole prophet.

<span id="iii.xi.xxxii-p6"></span>2. Being at that time in Athens, <span
id="fr_2028"></span>[2029](#fn_2028.md) he finished his work on Ezekiel and
commenced his Commentaries on the Song of Songs, <span
id="fr_2029"></span>[2030](#fn_2029.md) which he carried forward to the
fifth book. After his return to Cæsarea, he completed these also, ten
books in number.

<span id="iii.xi.xxxii-p9"></span>3. But why should we give in this
history an accurate catalogue of the man’s works, which would require a
separate treatise? <span id="fr_2030"></span>[2031](#fn_2030.md) we have
furnished this also in our narrative of the life of Pamphilus, <span
id="fr_2031"></span>[2032](#fn_2031.md) a holy martyr of our own time.
After showing how great the diligence of Pamphilus was in divine things,
we give in that a catalogue of the library which he collected of the
works of Origen and of other ecclesiastical writers. Whoever desires may
learn readily from this which of Origen’s works have reached us. But we
must proceed now with our history.

id="iii.xi.xxxii-p2.2"></span>

<span id="iii.xi.xxxii-p3"></span> “About this time” refers us still to
the reign of Gordian (238–244). Eusebius mentions only the commentaries
on Isaiah, but Jerome refers also to homilies and notes. The thirty
books which were extant in Eusebius’ time extended to XXX. 6, as we are
informed here. Whether the commentary originally went beyond this point
we do not know. There are extant only two brief Latin fragments from the
first and eighth books of the commentary, and nine homilies (the last
incomplete) in a Latin version by Jerome; printed by Lommatzsch, XIII.
235–301.

<span id="fn_2026"></span>[277:2027](2010202.htm#fr_2026.md) <span
id="iii.xi.xxxii-p3.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xi.xxxii-p4"></span> Eusebius records that Origen wrote
only twenty-five books of a commentary on Ezekiel. The form of
expression would seem to imply that these did not cover the whole of
Ezekiel, but a fragment of the twentieth book, extant in the eleventh
chapter of the *Philocalia,* deals with the thirty-fourth chapter of the
prophecy, so that the twenty-five books must have covered at any rate
most of the ground. The catalogue of Jerome mentions twenty-nine books
and twelve homilies, but the former number must be a mistake, for
Eusebius’ explicit statement that Origen wrote but twenty-five books can
hardly be doubted. There are extant only the Greek fragment of the
twentieth book referred to above, fourteen homilies in the Latin version
of Jerome, and a few extracts; all printed by Lommatzsch, XIV. 1–232.

<span id="fn_2027"></span>[277:2028](2010202.htm#fr_2027.md) <span
id="iii.xi.xxxii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xi.xxxii-p5"></span> i.e. to <span
id="iii.xi.xxxii-p5.1"></span>[Isa. xxx.
6](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#006.md)<span id="iii.xi.xxxii-p5.2"></span>,
where the LXX reads <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xi.xxxii-p5.3"></span>ἡ</span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xi.xxxii-p5.4"></span>ὄρασις τῶν τετραπόδων τῶν ἐν τῇ
ἐρήμῳ</span>, which are the exact words used by Eusebius. Our English
versions, both the authorized and revised, read, “The burden of the
beasts of the South.” The Hebrew will bear either rendering.

<span id="fn_2028"></span>[277:2029](2010202.htm#fr_2028.md) <span
id="iii.xi.xxxii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xi.xxxii-p7"></span> The cause of this second visit to
Athens we do not know, nor the date of it; although if Eusebius is to be
relied upon, it took place during the reign of Gordian (238–244). He
must have remained some time in Athens and have had leisure for study,
for he finished his commentary on Ezekiel and wrote five books of his
commentary on Canticles. This visit to Athens is to be distinguished
from the one referred to in chap. 23, because it is probable that Origen
found the Nicopolis copy of the Old Testament (mentioned in chap. 16) on
the occasion of a visit to Achaia, and this visit is apparently too
late, for he seems to have finished his *Hexapla* before this time; and
still further, the epistle in which he refers to spurious accounts of
his disputation at Athens (see Jerome’s *Apol. adv. Ruf.* II. 18)
complains also of Demetrius and of his own excommunication, which, as
Redepenning remarks, points to a date soon after that excommunication
took place, and not a number of years later, when Demetrius had been
long dead.

<span id="fn_2029"></span>[277:2030](2010202.htm#fr_2029.md) <span
id="iii.xi.xxxii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xi.xxxii-p8"></span> From the seventh chapter of the
*Philocalia* we learn that Origen, in his youth, wrote a small book
(<span class="Greek"><span id="iii.xi.xxxii-p8.1"></span>μικρὸς
τόμος</span>) upon Canticles, of which a single brief fragment is
preserved in that chapter. The catalogue of Jerome mentions ten books,
two books written early, and two homilies. Eusebius mentions only the
commentary, of which, he says, five books were written in Athens, and
five more in Cæsarea. The prologue and four books are extant in a Latin
translation by Rufinus, and two homilies in a translation by Jerome;
besides these, some Greek extracts made by Procopius,—all printed by
Lommatzsch, XIV. 233; XV. 108.
