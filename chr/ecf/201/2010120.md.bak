<span id="iii.ix.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.ix.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI.—</span>*The Heresiarchs of that
Age*.

<span id="iii.ix.xi-p2"></span>1. “<span class="c13"><span
id="iii.ix.xi-p2.1"></span>For</span> Valentinus came to Rome under
Hyginus, flourished under Pius, and remained until Anicetus. <span
id="fr_1064"></span>[1065](#fn_1064.md) Cerdon <span
id="fr_1065"></span>[1066](#fn_1065.md) also, Mar<span id="page_183">p.
183</span> <span id="iii.ix.xi-Page_183"></span>cion’s <span
id="fr_1066"></span>[1067](#fn_1066.md) predecessor, entered the Church in
the time of Hyginus, the ninth <span
id="fr_1067"></span>[1068](#fn_1067.md) bishop, and made confession, and
continued in this way, now teaching in secret, now making confession
again, and now denounced for corrupt doctrine and withdrawing <span
id="fr_1068"></span>[1069](#fn_1068.md) from the assembly of the brethren.”

<span id="iii.ix.xi-p8"></span>2. These words are found in the third
book of the work Against Heresies. And again in the first book he speaks
as follows concerning Cerdon: <span id="fr_1069"></span>[1070](#fn_1069.md)
“A certain Cerdon, who had taken his system from the followers of Simon,
and had come to Rome under Hyginus, the ninth in the episcopal
succession from the apostles, <span id="fr_1070"></span>[1071](#fn_1070.md)
taught that the God proclaimed by the law and prophets was not the
father of our Lord Jesus Christ. For the former was known, but the
latter unknown; and the former was just, but the latter good. <span
id="fr_1071"></span>[1072](#fn_1071.md) Marcion of Pontus succeeded Cerdon
and developed his doctrine, uttering shameless blasphemies.”

<span id="iii.ix.xi-p12"></span>3. The same Irenæus unfolds with the
greatest vigor the unfathomable abyss of Valentinus’ errors in regard to
matter, and reveals his wickedness, secret and hidden like a serpent
lurking in its nest.

<span id="iii.ix.xi-p13"></span>4. And in addition to these men he says
that there was also another that lived in that age, Marcus by
name, <span id="fr_1072"></span>[1073](#fn_1072.md) who was remarkably
skilled in magic arts. And he describes also their unholy initiations
and their abominable mysteries in the following words: <span
id="fr_1073"></span>[1074](#fn_1073.md)

<span id="iii.ix.xi-p16"></span>5. “For some of them prepare a nuptial
couch and perform a mystic rite with certain forms of expression
addressed to those who are being initiated, and they say that it is a
spiritual marriage which is celebrated by them, after the likeness of
the marriages above. But others lead them to water, and while they
baptize them they repeat the following words: Into the name of the
unknown father of the universe, into truth, the mother of all things,
into the one that descended upon Jesus. <span
id="fr_1074"></span>[1075](#fn_1074.md) Others repeat Hebrew names <span
id="fr_1075"></span>[1076](#fn_1075.md) in order the better to confound
those who are being initiated.”

<span id="iii.ix.xi-p19"></span>6. But Hyginus <span
id="fr_1076"></span>[1077](#fn_1076.md) having died at the close of the
fourth year of his episcopate, Pius <span
id="fr_1077"></span>[1078](#fn_1077.md) <span id="page_184">p. 184</span>
<span id="iii.ix.xi-Page_184"></span>succeeded him in the government of
the church of Rome. In Alexandria Marcus <span
id="fr_1078"></span>[1079](#fn_1078.md) was appointed pastor, after
Eumenes <span id="fr_1079"></span>[1080](#fn_1079.md) had filled the office
thirteen years in all. And Marcus having died after holding office ten
years was succeeded by Celadion <span
id="fr_1080"></span>[1081](#fn_1080.md) in the government of the church of
Alexandria.

<span id="iii.ix.xi-p25"></span>7. And in Rome Pius died in the
fifteenth year of his episcopate, and Anicetus <span
id="fr_1081"></span>[1082](#fn_1081.md) assumed the leadership of the
Christians there. Hegesippus records that he himself was in Rome at this
time, and that he remained there until the episcopate of
Eleutherus. <span id="fr_1082"></span>[1083](#fn_1082.md)

<span id="iii.ix.xi-p28"></span>8. But Justin <span
id="fr_1083"></span>[1084](#fn_1083.md) was especially prominent in those
days. In the guise of a philosopher <span
id="fr_1084"></span>[1085](#fn_1084.md) he preached the divine word, and
contended for the faith in his writings. He wrote also a work against
Marcion, <span id="fr_1085"></span>[1086](#fn_1085.md) in which he states
that the latter was alive at the time he wrote.

<span id="iii.ix.xi-p33"></span>9. He speaks as follows: <span
id="fr_1086"></span>[1087](#fn_1086.md) “And there is a certain
Marcion <span id="fr_1087"></span>[1088](#fn_1087.md) of Pontus, <span
id="fr_1088"></span>[1089](#fn_1088.md) who is even now <span
id="page_185">p. 185</span> <span id="iii.ix.xi-Page_185"></span>still
teaching his followers to think that there is some other God greater
than the creator. And by the aid of the demons <span
id="fr_1089"></span>[1090](#fn_1089.md) he has persuaded many of every race
of men <span id="fr_1090"></span>[1091](#fn_1090.md) to utter blasphemy,
and to deny that the maker of this universe is the father of Christ, and
to confess that some other, greater than he, was the creator. <span
id="fr_1091"></span>[1092](#fn_1091.md) And all who followed them are, as
we have said, <span id="fr_1092"></span>[1093](#fn_1092.md) called
Christians, just as the name of philosophy is given to philosophers,
although they may have no doctrines in common.”

<span id="iii.ix.xi-p42"></span>10. To this he adds: <span
id="fr_1093"></span>[1094](#fn_1093.md) “And we have also written a work
against all the heresies that have existed, <span
id="fr_1094"></span>[1095](#fn_1094.md) which we will give you if you wish
to read it.”

<span id="iii.ix.xi-p45"></span>11. But this same Justin contended most
successfully against the Greeks, and addressed discourses containing an
apology for our faith to the Emperor Antoninus, called Pius, and to the
Roman senate. <span id="fr_1095"></span>[1096](#fn_1095.md) For he lived at
Rome. But who and whence he was he shows in his Apology in the following
words. <span id="fr_1096"></span>[1097](#fn_1096.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1064"></span>[182:1065](2010120.htm#fr_1064.md) <span
id="iii.ix.xi-p2.2"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.xi-p3"></span> Valentinus is the best known of the
Gnostics. According to Epiphanius (*Hær.* XXXI. 2) he was born on the
coast of Egypt, and studied Greek literature and science at Alexandria.
The same writer, on the authority of the lost *Syntagma* of Hippolytus,
informs us that he taught in Cyprus, and this must have been before he
went to Rome. The direct statement of Irenæus as to the date of his
activity there is confirmed by Tertullian, and perhaps by Clement of
Alexandria, and is not to be doubted. Since Hyginus held office in all
probability from 137–141, and Anicetus from 154 or 155 to 166 or 167,
Valentinus must have been in Rome at least thirteen years. His
chronological position between Basilides and Marcion (as given by
Clement of Alexandria, *Strom.* VII. 17) makes it probable that he came
to Rome early in Antoninus’ reign and remained there during all or the
most of that reign, but not longer. Valentinus’ followers divided into
two schools, an Oriental and an Italian, and constituted by far the most
numerous and influential Gnostic sect. His system is the most profound
and artistic of the Gnostic systems, and reveals great depth and power
of mind. For an excellent account of Valentinus and Valentinianism, see
Lipsius’ article in the *Dict. of Christ. Biog.* Vol. IV. Valentinus
occupies a prominent place in all works on Gnosticism.

<span id="fn_1065"></span>[182:1066](2010120.htm#fr_1065.md) <span
id="iii.ix.xi-p3.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.xi-p4"></span> Cerdon is best known as the teacher of
Marcion. Epiphanius (*Hær*. XLI.) and Philaster (*Hær*. XLIV.) call him
a native of Syria. Epiphanius speaks of a sect of Cerdonians, but there
seems never to have been such a sect, and his disciples probably early
became followers of Marcion, who joined Cerdon soon after reaching Rome.
It is not possible to distinguish his teachings from those of his pupil,
Marcion. Hippolytus (X. 15) treats Cerdon and Marcion together, making
no attempt to distinguish their doctrines. Irenæus, in the passage
quoted, and the lost *Syntagma* of Hippolytus (represented by
Pseudo-Tertullian’s *Adv. Hær.* and by Epiphanius) distinguish the two,
treating Cerdon separately but very briefly. The doctrines of Cerdon,
however, given by them, are identical with or at least very similar to
the known views of Marcion. If they were really Cerdon’s positions
before Marcion came to him, then his influence over Marcion was most
decided.

<span id="fn_1066"></span>[183:1067](2010120.htm#fr_1066.md) <span
id="iii.ix.xi-p4.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.xi-p5"></span> On Marcion, see below, note 24.

<span id="fn_1067"></span>[183:1068](2010120.htm#fr_1067.md) <span
id="iii.ix.xi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.xi-p6"></span> The Latin text of Irenæus here reads
“eighth” instead of “ninth.” See below, note 7.

<span id="fn_1068"></span>[183:1069](2010120.htm#fr_1068.md) <span
id="iii.ix.xi-p6.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.xi-p7"></span> ἐφιστ€μενος. This is commonly taken to
mean that Cerdon was excommunicated. But as Valesius remarks, the
participle is strictly middle, not passive. The distinction, however,
cannot be insisted upon in the present case, and therefore we cannot
determine decisively whether Cerdon was excluded by the congregation or
excluded himself.

<span id="fn_1069"></span>[183:1070](2010120.htm#fr_1069.md) <span
id="iii.ix.xi-p8.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.xi-p9"></span> Irenæus, *Adv. Hær*. I. 27. 1–2.

<span id="fn_1070"></span>[183:1071](2010120.htm#fr_1070.md) <span
id="iii.ix.xi-p9.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.xi-p10"></span> Hyginus is here called the ninth
bishop, and the reading is confirmed by a passage in Cyprian’s epistle
to Pompey (*Ep*. LXXIII. 2 in the *Ante-Nicene Fathers*), and also by
Epiphanius (*Hær*. LXI. 1). In the passage quoted just above, however,
from the third book of Irenæus, although Eusebius calls Hyginus the
“ninth,” the Latin text of Irenæus makes him the “eighth,” and according
to Salmon in the *Dict of Christ. Biog*.: “The <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.ix.xi-p10.1"></span>ms</span>. evidence is decisive that Irenæus
here \[in the passage quoted above from III. 4. 3\] describes Hyginus as
the eighth bishop, and this agrees with the list of Roman bishops given
in the preceding chapter (*Adv. Hær*. III. 3. 3), and with the
description of Anicetus as the tenth bishop a couple of chapters further
on. Lipsius hence infers that Irenæus drew his account of Cerdon from
two sources in which Hyginus was differently described, but this
inference is very precarious. In the interval between the composition of
the first and third books, Irenæus may have been led to alter his way of
counting by investigations concerning the succession of the Roman
bishops, which he had in the meantime either made himself, or adopted
from Hegesippus. As for the numeration ‘ninth,’ we do not venture to
pronounce whether it indicates a list in which Peter was counted first
bishop, or one in which Cletus and Anacletus were reckoned as distinct.”
According to Eusebius’ own reckoning up to the present chapter, Hyginus
was the eighth, not the ninth, from the apostles, for in chap. 5, above,
he calls Telesphorus (Hyginus’ predecessor) the seventh, in chap. 1,
Alexander (the predecessor of Xystus, who preceded Telesphorus) the
fifth, and so on. Why, in the passage quoted at the beginning of this
chapter, he should change his reckoning, and call Hyginus the ninth if
the original list of Irenæus from which he drew said eighth is difficult
to see. It is possible that he made the change under the influence of
the “ninth,” in the present passage, which certainly stood in the
original text. It would be easier to think this if the order in which
the passages are quoted were reversed, but it may be that Eusebius had
the present quotation in mind when making the first, or that he went
back afterward and corrected that to correspond. If he ventured to
change the text of Irenæus in that passage, he must have done it in all
good faith, assuming a mistake in transcription, where the contradiction
was so glaring. It still remains to me inexplicable, however, why he did
not change the “ninth” of the second passage to “eighth” instead of the
“eighth” of the first passage to “ninth.” He would thus have gotten rid
of all contradictions, and have remained consistent with himself. I am
tempted, in fact, to believe that Eusebius found “ninth” in the original
of both passages quoted, and copied just what he found. At the same
time, I do not feel disposed in the face of what Lipsius and Salmon say
as to the original text of Irenæus to claim that Irenæus himself wrote
“ninth” at that point.

<span id="fn_1071"></span>[183:1072](2010120.htm#fr_1071.md) <span
id="iii.ix.xi-p10.2"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.xi-p11"></span> Marcion drew this same distinction
between the strictly just God of the Old Testament and the good or
merciful God of the New, and the distinction was a fundamental one in
his system. It is noticeable that Pseudo-Tertullian (*Adv. Omnes Hær*.
chap 6) says that Cerdon taught two Gods, one good, the other cruel
(*sævum*); the good being the superior God,—the latter, the cruel one,
being the creator of the world.

<span id="fn_1072"></span>[183:1073](2010120.htm#fr_1072.md) <span
id="iii.ix.xi-p13.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.xi-p14"></span> Irenæus gives an account of Marcus and
the Marcosians in I. 13–21. He was a Gnostic of the sect of Valentinus.
Jerome calls him a Basilidian (*Ep*. LXXV. 3), but he was mistaken.
Hippolytus and Epiphanius (*Hær*. 34) copy their accounts from Irenæus,
and probably had no direct knowledge of the works of Marcus, or of his
sect. Clement of Alexandria, however, knew and used his writings. It is
probable that Asia Minor was the scene of his labors. He is spoken of in
the present tense by Irenæus, and hence seems to have been alive when he
wrote; that is, in the latter part of the second century. His additions
to Valentinianism lay chiefly, perhaps solely, in the introduction of
worthless magic rites. He seems to have lowered greatly the tone of the
philosophical Gnosticism of Valentinus. See Salmon’s article in the
*Dict. of Christ. Biog*.

<span id="fn_1073"></span>[183:1074](2010120.htm#fr_1073.md) <span
id="iii.ix.xi-p14.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.xi-p15"></span> Irenæus, *Adv. Hær*. I. 21. 3.

<span id="fn_1074"></span>[183:1075](2010120.htm#fr_1074.md) <span
id="iii.ix.xi-p16.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.xi-p17"></span> εἰς τὸν κατελθόντα εἰς τὸν ᾽Ιησοῦν.
Taking the Greek simply as it stands, we should naturally put a comma
before the second εἰς, and translate “into the one that descended, into
Jesus,” identifying the “one that descended” with Jesus. But the
Gnostics in general taught that Jesus was only a man, upon whom
descended one of the æons, or higher spiritual powers, and hence it is
plain that in the present case the “one that descended upon \[or
literally “into”\] Jesus” is referred to here as the third person of the
baptismal Trinity.

<span id="fn_1075"></span>[183:1076](2010120.htm#fr_1075.md) <span
id="iii.ix.xi-p17.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.xi-p18"></span> The Greek and Latin texts of Irenæus
add at this point widely variant lists of these words, but in both lists
the words are quite meaningless.

<span id="fn_1076"></span>[183:1077](2010120.htm#fr_1076.md) <span
id="iii.ix.xi-p19.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.xi-p20"></span> On Hyginus, see the previous chapter,
note 3.

<span id="fn_1077"></span>[183:1078](2010120.htm#fr_1077.md) <span
id="iii.ix.xi-p20.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.xi-p21"></span> Eusebius states, just below, that Pius
held office fifteen years, and in his *Chronicle* he gives the same
figure. In that work (Armen. version) he places his accession in the
first year of Antoninus Pius, though the version of Jerome assigns it to
the fifth year, and with this Eusebius agrees in his *History*, for in
the previous chapter he puts the accession of Hyginus in the first year
of Antoninus Pius, and here tells us that Hyginus held office four
years. Lipsius assigns Pius’ episcopate to the years 139–154, as the
earliest possible termini; the years 141–156 as the latest. But since we
learn from chapter 14, below, that Polycarp was in Rome during the
episcopate of Anicetus, and from other sources (see chapter 15, note 2)
that he was martyred in Asia Minor in 155 or 156, we may assume it as
certain that Pius cannot have held office as late as 156. The earlier
date for his death (154) may therefore be accepted as more probable. The
Liberian and Felician Catalogues put Anicetus between Hyginus and Pius;
but that is certainly incorrect, for, in support of the order given here
by Eusebius, we have the testimony both of Hegesippus, quoted below, in
chap. 22, and of Irenæus (III. 3). Pius is commonly regarded as the
first monarchical bishop in the strict sense, the so-called bishops
before his time having been simply leading presbyters or presbyter
bishops of the Roman church (see chap. 11, note 14). According to the
Muratorian Fragment and the Liberian Catalogue, Pius was the brother of
Hermas, the author of the *Shepherd*. Upon this alleged relationship,
see Bk. III. chap. 3, note 23.

<span id="fn_1078"></span>[184:1079](2010120.htm#fr_1078.md) <span
id="iii.ix.xi-p21.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.xi-p22"></span> Of Marcus we know only what Eusebius
tells us here: that he succeded Eumenes, after the latter had held
office thirteen years, and that he continued in office ten years. If
Eumenes became bishop in 132 or 133 (see above, chap. 5, note 16), then
Marcus must have succeeded him in 145 or 146, and this agrees with the
Armenian *Chron*. of Eusebius, which, while it does not mention the
accession of Marcus, yet puts the accession of his successor Celadin in
the eighteenth year of Antoninus Pius, which would make the beginning of
his own episcopate the eighth year of the same ruler. Jerome’s version
of the *Chron*., however, puts it in the sixth year. Little reliance is
to be placed upon any of the dates of the Alexandrian bishops during the
first two centuries.

<span id="fn_1079"></span>[184:1080](2010120.htm#fr_1079.md) <span
id="iii.ix.xi-p22.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.xi-p23"></span> On Eumenes, see above, chap. 5, note
14.

<span id="fn_1080"></span>[184:1081](2010120.htm#fr_1080.md) <span
id="iii.ix.xi-p23.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.xi-p24"></span> Of Celadion we know only what Eusebius
tells us here, and in chap. 19, where he gives fourteen years as the
duration of his episcopate. As mentioned in the previous note, the
Armenian *Chron*. of Eusebius puts his accession in the eighteenth year
of Antoninus Pius, i.e. 155 or 156, while the version of Jerome puts it
in the sixteenth year.

<span id="fn_1081"></span>[184:1082](2010120.htm#fr_1081.md) <span
id="iii.ix.xi-p25.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.xi-p26"></span> Anicetus, according to the Armenian
*Chron*. of Eusebius, succeeded Pius in the fifteenth year of Antoninus
Pius; according to Jerome’s version, in the eighteenth year (i.e. 155 or
156), which is more nearly correct. Lipsius puts his accession between
154 and 156 (see note 14, above). According to chap. 19, below, with
which both versions of the *Chron*. agree, Anicetus held office eleven
years; i.e. until 165 to 167, when he was succeeded by Soter. Irenæus
(as quoted by Eusebius in Bk. V. chap. 24) informs us that Polycarp was
in Rome in the time of Anicetus, and endeavored to induce him to adopt
the Quartodeciman practice of celebrating Easter; but that, while the
two remained perfectly friendly to one another, Anicetus would not
change the custom of the Roman church (see the notes on the chapter
referred to). As stated in note 13, the Liberian and Felician Catalogues
incorrectly insert the name of Anicetus between those of Hyginus and
Pius.

<span id="fn_1082"></span>[184:1083](2010120.htm#fr_1082.md) <span
id="iii.ix.xi-p26.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.xi-p27"></span> Eusebius evidently makes a mistake
here. That Hegesippus remained so long in Rome (Anicetus ruled from
154–168 (?), and Eleutherus from 177–190) is upon the face of it very
improbable. And in this case we can see clearly how Eusebius made his
mistake. In chap. 22 he quotes a passage from Hegesippus in regard to
his stay in Rome, and it was in all probability this passage from which
Eusebius drew his conclusion. But Hegesippus says there that he
“remained in Rome until the time of Anicetus,” &c. It is probable,
therefore, that he returned to the East during Anicetus’ episcopacy. He
does not express himself as one who had remained in Rome until the reign
of Eleutherus; but Eusebius, from a hasty reading, might easily have
gathered that idea. According to Hegesippus’ account in chap. 22, he
must, then, have come to Rome *before* Anicetus, i.e. during the reign
of Pius, and this Eusebius does not here contradict, though he is said
to do so by Reading, who translates the Greek words, ἐπιδημῆσαι τῇ
῾Ρώμῃ, “came to the city” (so, also, Closs, Stigloher, and Crusè). But
the words properly mean “to be in Rome,” not “to come to Rome,” which
would require, rather, ἐπιδημῆσαι εἰς τὴν ῾Ρώμην, as in §2, above, where
the words are used of Cerdon. Jerome, to be sure (*de vir. ill*. 22),
says that Hegesippus came to Rome in the time of Anicetus; but his
account rests solely upon Eusebius, whom he mistranslated. The
tradition, therefore, that Hegesippus came to Rome in the time of
Anicetus has no foundation; he was already there, as he himself informs
us, in chap. 22, below. Cf. the note on this passage, in chap. 22.

<span id="fn_1083"></span>[184:1084](2010120.htm#fr_1083.md) <span
id="iii.ix.xi-p28.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.xi-p29"></span> Eusebius here puts Justin in his proper
place, in the time of Antoninus Pius. The date of his birth is unknown,
though it cannot have been far from the beginning of the second century.
He was born in Flavia Neapolis, a Roman town built close by the ruins of
the ancient Sychem, in Samaria. He was of heathen parentage, and
received a thoroughly Greek education. He became an earnest student of
philosophy, and after turning to many different systems in his search
for truth, he was at last converted to Christianity, where he found that
for which he had been searching; and his whole conception of
Christianity shows the influence of the manner in which he accepted it.
The date of his conversion is unknown, but it seems (from *Dial*. I. 1)
to have taken place at least before the close of the Barcochba war (135
<span class="c13"><span id="iii.ix.xi-p29.1"></span>a.d</span>.). He
died as a martyr at Rome. The date of his death is difficult to
determine, but it probably took place under Marcus Aurelius, in 163+.
Upon his death, see below, chap. 16, note 4. Upon Justin, see Semich’s
*Justin der Märtyrer*, Otto’s edition of the Greek Apologists, von
Engelhardt’s article in Herzog, 2d ed., Holland’s article in Smith and
Wace’s *Dict. of Christ. Biog*., and finally Schaff’s *Ch. Hist*. II.
p.110 sq., where the most important literature is mentioned. Upon his
theology, see especially von Engelhardt’s masterly monograph, *Das
Christenthum Justins des Märtyrers* (Erlangen, 1878). A recent and
interesting discussion of Justin’s testimony to early Christianity is
found in Purves’ work on that subject (New York, 1889).

<span id="iii.ix.xi-p30"></span> ἐν σχήματι φιλοσόφου. The reference
here is to the distinctive cloak or mantle of the Greek philosophers,
which was called the *pallium*, and to which Justin refers in his *Dial.
c. Trypho*, §1. The wearing of the mantle was an advantage to the
philosophers, inasmuch as it gave them peculiar opportunities to engage
in philosophic discourse in the street or market, or other public
places, which they could not otherwise so easily have enjoyed. Perhaps
it was this fact which led Justin to continue wearing the cloak, and we
see from the introduction to his Dialogue that it was the wearing of it
which was the immediate occasion of his conversation with Trypho and his
friends. Heraclas, the friend of Origen, also continued to wear the
philosopher’s cloak after his conversion, as we learn from Bk. VI. chap.
19.

<span id="iii.ix.xi-p31"></span> This work against Marcion is also
mentioned by Irenæus, who quotes from it in his *Adv. Hær*. IV. 16. 2
(see below, chap. 18), and by Photius, *Cod*. 125. The work is lost, and
we have only the single brief fragment preserved by Irenæus. It is
possible that it formed a part of the larger *Syntagma contra omnes
Hæreses*, mentioned by Justin in his *Apol*. I. 26 (see below), and it
has been urged in support of this possibility that Irenæus nowhere
mentions a work of Justin’s *Against all Heresies*, although it is
highly probable that he made use of such a work (see Lipsius’ *Quellen
der ältesten Ketzergesch*. and Harnack’s *Zur Quellenkritik des
Gnosticismus*). It would seem that Irenæus is referring to this work
when he mentions the *Syntagma contra Marcionem*. On the other hand,
Photius mentions the work against Marcion and the one against all
heresies as two separate works. He does not seem, however, to have had a
personal knowledge of them, and is possibly only repeating Eusebius
(Harnack says he is certainly doing so, *Ueberlieferung d. griech.
Apol*. p. 150; but in view of the fact that he omits two works mentioned
by Eusebius, this seems to be somewhat doubtful); and if this is so, no
reliance is to be placed upon his report, for it is evident that
Eusebius himself knew neither of the two works, and hence the fact that
he distinguishes them has no significance. Although, therefore, it
cannot be determined whether Justin wrote two separate works against
heretics, it is quite probable that he did not.

<span id="iii.ix.xi-p32"></span>The conduct of Eusebius in this
connection is very peculiar. After mentioning the work against Marcion,
he at once gives a quotation in such a way as to convey the impression
that the quotation is taken from this work, but it is really taken from
the first *Apology*. This makes it very probable that he had not seen
this work against Marcion, a conclusion which is confirmed by its
omission from the list of Justin’s writings given in chap. 18. It is
claimed by many that Eusebius practices a little deception here, wishing
to convey the impression that he knew a book which he did not know. This
is not in accord with his usual conduct (as he seldom hesitates to
confess his ignorance of any matter), and his general character for
candor and honesty must be taken into account in deciding the case. He
does not state directly that the quotation is taken from the work
against Marcion, and it is possible that the seeming reference of it to
that source was an oversight on his part. But it must be acknowledged,
if that be the case, that he was very careless in making the quotation.

<span id="iii.ix.xi-p34"></span> Justin, *Apol*. I. 26.

<span id="fn_1087"></span>[184:1088](2010120.htm#fr_1087.md) <span
id="iii.ix.xi-p34.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.xi-p35"></span> Marcion cannot be called a Gnostic in
the strict sense of the term. He was rather an anti-Jewish reformer. He
had much in common with the Gnostics, but laid stress upon belief rather
than upon knowledge. He developed no complete system as did the extreme
and perverted Paulinism, considering Paul the only true apostle and
rejecting the others as Judaizing teachers. He cut the Gospel away from
its historical connections, repudiating the Old Testament and all of the
New except a mutilated Gospel of Luke and the Epistles of Paul, and
denying the identity of the God of the Old Testament with the Supreme
God, and the identity of Jesus with the promised Jewish Messiah. He
magnified the mercy of God in redemption at the expense of creation,
which he attributed to the demiurge, and in which he saw nothing good.
He was an extreme anti-metaphysician, and the first Biblical critic. He
was born in Pontus, was the son of a bishop, went to Rome about 135
<span class="c13"><span id="iii.ix.xi-p35.1"></span>a.d</span>., and
endeavored to carry out his reforms there, but was unsuccessful, and
very soon broke with the Church. He traveled extensively and
disseminated his doctrines very widely. The sect existed well on into
the Middle Ages, and some of his opinions have never been completely
eradicated. In Rome the Gnostic Cerdon exercised great influence over
him, and to him are doubtless due many of Marcion’s Gnostic traits. The
dualism which he held in common with the Gnostics arose rather from
practical than speculative considerations; but his followers in the
fourth and fifth centuries, when they had lost his practical religious
spirit and yet retained his dualism, passed over quite naturally into
Manicheeism. He was attacked by Justin, Irenæus, Tertullian, and all the
anti-heretical writers of the early Church, and was considered one of
the most dangerous of heretics. A complete monograph upon Marcion is
still a desideratum, but he is discussed in all the general accounts of
Gnosticism; see especially the brief but excellent account by Harnack,
*Dogmengeschichte*, I. 197–214.

<span id="iii.ix.xi-p36"></span> Pontus was a province in Northeastern
Asia Minor, bordering upon the Black Sea.

<span id="fn_1089"></span>[185:1090](2010120.htm#fr_1089.md) <span
id="iii.ix.xi-p36.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.xi-p37"></span> Justin here agrees with Eusebius in his
transcendental theory of heresy, looking upon it not as a natural growth
from within, but as an infliction upon the Church from without, through
the agency of demons. Indeed, this was the prevailing notion of the
early Church.

<span id="fn_1090"></span>[185:1091](2010120.htm#fr_1090.md) <span
id="iii.ix.xi-p37.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.xi-p38"></span> The extent of Marcion’s influence
referred to here is very significant. Gnosticism was not intended for
common people, and never spread among the masses, but on the contrary
was confined to philosophers and speculative thinkers. In this respect,
Marcion, whose sect included multitudes of all classes, was
distinguished most sharply from them, and it was because of the
popularity of his sect that his heresy appeared so dangerous to the
early Church.

<span id="fn_1091"></span>[185:1092](2010120.htm#fr_1091.md) <span

<span id="iii.ix.xi-p39"></span> ἄλλον δέ τινα ὡς, ὄντα μείζονα παρὰ
τοῦτον ὁμολογεῖν πεποιηκέναι. The sentence as it thus stands is very
difficult to construe, for we are compelled to take the last verb
without an object, in the sense of *create*. Our <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.ix.xi-p39.1"></span>mss</span>. of Justin Martyr insert after
the ὡςὄντα μείζονα the words τὰ μείζονα, and the sentence then reads,
“some other one, greater than he, has done greater works.” It is plain
that this was the original form of the sentence, and that the harsh
construction found in Eusebius is a result of defective transcription.
It was very easy for a copyist to drop out the second μείζονα.

<span id="fn_1092"></span>[185:1093](2010120.htm#fr_1092.md) <span
id="iii.ix.xi-p39.2"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.xi-p40"></span> Justin refers here to *Apol*. I. 7. He
wishes to have it clear that not all that call themselves Christians are
really such. From chaps. 26–29, we see that in Justin’s time the
Christians were accused of great immoralities, and in this same chapter
(chap. 26) he is rather inclined to throw the guilt upon heretics,
although he does not expressly accuse them of it (“whether they
perpetrate these shameful deeds—we know not”). See above.

<span id="iii.ix.xi-p41"></span>His mention of philosophers here in his
appeal to the philosophical emperors is very shrewd.

<span id="fn_1093"></span>[185:1094](2010120.htm#fr_1093.md) <span

<span id="fn_1094"></span>[185:1095](2010120.htm#fr_1094.md) <span
id="iii.ix.xi-p43.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.xi-p44"></span> This work is not mentioned by Eusebius
in the list of Justin’s works which he gives in chap. 18. He had,
therefore, undoubtedly never seen it. Irenæus nowhere mentions it under
this title, though he seems to have made extensive use of it, and he
does mention a work, *Against Marcion*, which is very likely to be
identified with the work referred to here (see Harnack’s *Zur
Quellenkritik des Gnosticismus*). The work, which is now lost, is
mentioned by Photius (*Cod*. 125), but he evidently had never seen it,
and is simply copying some earlier list, perhaps that of Eusebius. His
testimony to the work, therefore, amounts to little. Compare note 22,
above.

*Against the Greeks*, see below, chap. 18, notes 3 and 4. As shown in
note 3 of that chapter, he really wrote only one *Apology*.
