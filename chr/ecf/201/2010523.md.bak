employed himself with pleasure: but the effects of that envious spirit
which so troubled the peace of the churches of God in Alexandria,
together with the Theban and Egyptian schism, continued to cause him no
little disturbance of mind. For in fact, in every city bishops were
engaged in obstinate conflict with bishops, and people rising against
people; and almost like the fabled Symplegades, <span

each other. Nay, some were so far transported beyond the bounds of
reason as to be guilty of reckless and outrageous conduct, and even to
insult the statues of the emperor. This state of things had little power
to excite his anger, but rather caused in him sorrow of spirit; for he
deeply deplored the folly thus exhibited by deranged men.

by which the Argo was said (*Od.* 12. 69) to be the only ship which ever
passed in safety.
