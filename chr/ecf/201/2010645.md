of the same Church.*

<span id="iv.vi.iv.lix-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.lix-p2.1"></span>Such</span> was the magnificence with
which the emperor was pleased to beautify this church. The building was
surrounded by an open area of great extent, the four sides of which were
terminated by porticos which enclosed the area and the church itself.
Adjoining these porticos were ranges of stately chambers, with baths and
promenades, and besides many apartments adapted to the use of those who
had charge of the place.
