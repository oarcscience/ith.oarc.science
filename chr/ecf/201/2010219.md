and Gallus.*

<span id="iii.xii.ii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xii.ii-p2.1"></span>When</span> Decius had reigned not quite two
years, <span id="fr_2160"></span>[2161](#fn_2160) he was slain with his

sixty-nine years of age. <span id="fr_2161"></span>[2162](#fn_2161)
Dionysius, writing to Hermammon, <span

id="fr_2163"></span>[2164](#fn_2163)

<span id="iii.xii.ii-p7"></span>“Gallus neither recognized the
wickedness of Decius, nor considered what had destroyed him; but
stumbled on the same stone, though it lay before his eyes. For when his
reign was prosperous and affairs were proceeding according to his mind,
he attacked the holy men who were interceding with God for his peace and
welfare. Therefore with them he persecuted also their prayers in his
behalf.” So much concerning him.

<span id="iii.xii.ii-p3"></span> Decius reigned about thirty months,
from the summer of 249 until almost the close of the year 251 (see
Tillemont, *Hist. des Emp.* III. p. 285). His son Herennius Etruscus was
slain with his father in a battle fought against the Goths in Thrace;
another son, Hostilianus, was associated in the purple with Decius’
successor, Gallus, but died soon afterwards, probably by the plague,
which was at that time raging; possibly, as was suspected, by the
treachery of Gallus. There has been some controversy as to whether
Hostilianus was a son, or only a nephew, or a son-in-law of Decius.
Eusebius in speaking of more than one son becomes an independent witness
to the former alternative, and there is really little reason to doubt
it, for Zosimus’ statements are explicit (see Zosimus, I. 25, and cf.
Tillemont, *ibid.* p. 506). Two other sons are mentioned in one
inscription but its genuineness is doubtful. Eusebius, however, may be
urged as a witness that he had more than two (cf. Tillemont, *ibid.*).

<span id="iii.xii.ii-p5"></span> Of this Hermammon we know nothing. The
words of Eusebius at the close of chap. 22, below, lead us to think that
he was probably a bishop of some church in Egypt. Fragments of the
epistle addressed to him are preserved in this chapter and in chapters
10 and 23, below. It is possible that Dionysius wrote more than one
epistle to Hermammon and that the fragments which we have are from
different letters. This, however, is not probable, for Eusebius gives no
hint that he is quoting from more than one epistle, and, moreover, the
three extracts which we have correspond excellently with one another,
seeming to be drawn from a single epistle which contained a description
of the conduct of successive emperors toward the Christians. The date of
the epistle is given at the close of chap. 23; namely, the ninth year of
the Emperor Gallienus (i.e. August, 261–August, 262), reckoning from the
time of his association with his father Valerian in the purple.

<span id="fn_2163"></span>[293:2164](2010219.htm#fr_2163) <span
id="iii.xii.ii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.ii-p6"></span> Gallus succeeded Decius toward the
close of the year 251 and reigned until the summer of 253 (some with
less ground say 254), when he was slain, with his son, by his own
soldiers. His persecution of the Christians (under him, for instance,
Cornelius, bishop of Rome, was banished, see above, Bk. VI. chap. 39,
note 3), seems to have been less the result of a deeply rooted religious
conviction and a fixed political principle (such as Decius possessed)
than of the terrible plague which had begun during the reign of Decius
and was ravaging the empire during the early part of Gallus’ reign (see
Tillemont’s *Hist. des Emp.* III. p. 288). He persecuted, therefore, not
so much as a matter of principle as because he desired either to appease
the populace or to propitiate the Gods, whom he superstitiously
believed, as the people did, to be the authors of the terrible scourge.
