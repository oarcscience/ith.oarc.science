id="iv.vi.ii.liii-p1.1"></span>Chapter LIII</span>.—*That the Barbarians
kindly received the Christians.*

<span id="iv.vi.ii.liii-p2"></span>“<span class="c13"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.liii-p2.1"></span>But</span> what is the consequence of
this? Why, the barbarians themselves may boast now of the contrast their
conduct presents to these creel deeds; for they received and kept in
gentlest captivity those who then fled from amongst us, and secured to
them not merely safety from danger, but also the free exercise of their
holy religion. And now the Roman people bear that lasting stain which
the Christians, at that time driven from the Roman world, and taking
refuge with the barbarians, have branded on them.
