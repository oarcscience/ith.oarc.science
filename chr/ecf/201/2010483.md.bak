who have become masters of such property (if it be right or possible to
allow them such a title) will assure us by way of apology for their
conduct, that it was not in their power to abstain from this
appropriation at a time when a spectacle of misery in all its forms
everywhere met the view; when men were cruelly driven from their homes,
slaughtered without mercy, thrust forth without remorse: when the
confiscation of the property of innocent persons was a common thing, and
<span id="page_510">p. 510</span> <span
id="iv.vi.ii.xxxviii-Page_510"></span>when persecutions and property
seizures were unceasing. If any defend their conduct by such reasons as
these, and still persist in their avaricious temper, they shall be made
sensible that such a course will bring punishment on themselves, and all
the more because this correction of evil is the very characteristic of
our service to the Supreme God. So that it will henceforth be dangerous
to retain what dire necessity may in time past have compelled men to
take; especially because it is in any case incumbent on us to discourage
covetous desires, both by persuasion, and by warning examples.
