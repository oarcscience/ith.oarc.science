<span id="iv.vi.ii.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II</span>.—*Demolition of Churches,
and Butchery of the Bishops.*

<span id="iv.vi.ii.ii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.ii-p2.1"></span>For</span> in that city some of the
churches, for the second time since the commencement of the
persecutions, were leveled with the ground, and others were closed by
the governors of the several districts, in order to prevent any who
frequented them from assembling together, or rendering due worship to
God. For he by whose orders these outrages were committed was too
conscious of his own crimes to expect that these services were performed
with any view to his benefit, and was convinced that all we did, and all
our endeavors to obtain the favor of God, were on Constantine’s behalf.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.ii-p3"></span>These servile governors <span
id="fr_3159"></span>[3160](#fn_3159.md) then, feeling assured that such a
course would be pleasing to the impious tyrant, subjected the most
distinguished prelates of the churches to capital punishment.
Accordingly, men who had been guilty of no crime were led away, without
cause <span id="fr_3160"></span>[3161](#fn_3160.md) punished like
murderers: and some suffered a new kind of death, having their bodies
cut piecemeal; and, after this cruel punishment, more horrible than any
named in tragedy, being cast, as a food to fishes, into the depths of
the sea. The result of these horrors was again, as before, the flight of
pious men, and once more the fields and deserts received the worshipers
of God. The tyrant, having thus far succeeded in his object, he farther
determined to raise a general persecution of the Christians: <span
id="fr_3161"></span>[3162](#fn_3161.md) and he would have accomplished his
purpose, nor could anything have hindered him from carrying his
resolution into effect, had not he who defends his own anticipated the
coming evil, and by his special guidance conducted his servant
Constantine to this part of the empire, causing him to shine forth as a
brilliant light in the midst of the darkness and gloomy night.
