<span id="iv.iii.iv.iii-p1"></span> 2. *Constantine the Son of a British
Princess.*

<span id="iv.iii.iv.iii-p2"></span>Duke Coel of Colchester, say the old
chronicles, by an insurrection became king. The Senate, rejoiced at the
overthrow of an enemy, sent Constantius to Britain. Coel, fearing, sent
ambassadors to meet him, gave hostages, and shortly died. Constantius
was crowned, married Helena, daughter of Coel, the most beautiful,
cultivated, and educated woman of her time. By her he had a son,
Constantine, afterwards called the Great. This is in substance the
account of Geoffrey of Monmouth (5. 6) and Pierre de Langloft (1, p.
66–7). The story is mentioned by <span id="page_442">p. 442</span> <span
id="iv.iii.iv.iii-Page_442"></span>Henry of Huntington (Bk. I. 37), who
perhaps wrote before Geoffrey (in 1137 \[?\]), and Richard of
Cirencester (2. 1. 33). Waurin (Vol. I. Bk. 2. 43) makes “Choel” Count
of Leicester, but in general is identical with Geoffrey. The famous Brut
of Layamon (ed. Madden, 2 \[1847\] p. 35) is translated with
amplifications from Wace’s Brut, and this in turn from Geoffrey. This
makes Coel Earl of Gloucester. The Eulogium Hist. calls Helena (1. 337)
daughter of a British king, but also concubine, though elsewhere (2, p.
267) she is wife according to the conventional story. It is also
mentioned by many others; e.g. Voragine, *Golden Legend*. It is
interesting that this legendary father of Helena is supposed (Hayden,
Index to Eulogium, p. 45, and Giles, note on Geoffrey, p. 162) to be the
same as “Old King Cole, the merry old soul,” making Constantine thus the
grandson of the Mother Goose hero.
