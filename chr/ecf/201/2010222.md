<span id="iii.xii.v-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xii.v-p2.1"></span>Dionysius</span>, therefore, having
communicated with him extensively on this question by letter, <span

persecution had abated, <span id="fr_2172"></span>[2173](#fn_2172.md) the
churches everywhere had rejected the novelty of Novatus, and were at
peace among themselves. He writes as follows:

<span id="iii.xii.v-p3"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xii.v-p3.1"></span>διὰ γραμμ€των</span>, which might mean
“letters,” but in the present case must refer apparently to a single
letter (the plural, <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xii.v-p3.2"></span>γρ€μματα</span>, like the Latin *litteræ,*
was very commonly used to denote a single epistle), for in chap. 2
Eusebius says that Dionysius’ first epistle on baptism was addressed to
Stephen, and in chap. 5 informs us that his second was addressed to
Xystus. The epistle mentioned here must be the one referred to in chap.
2 and must have been devoted chiefly to the question of the re-baptism
of heretics or schismatics (<span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xii.v-p3.3"></span>περὶ τούτου</span> referring evidently to the
subject spoken of in the previous chapter). But Eusebius quite
irrelevantly quotes from the epistle a passage not upon the subject in
hand, but upon an entirely different one, viz. upon the peace which had
been established in the Eastern churches, after the disturbances caused
by the schism of Novatian (see Bk. VI. chap. 43 sq.). That the peace
spoken of in this epistle cannot mean, as Baronius held, that the
Eastern churches had come over to Stephen’s opinion in regard to the
subject of baptism is clear enough from the fact that Dionysius wrote
another epistle to Stephen’s successor (see the next chapter) in which
he still defended the practice of re-baptism. In fact, the passage
quoted by Eusebius from Dionysius’ epistle to Stephen has no reference
to the subject of baptism.
