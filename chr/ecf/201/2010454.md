<span id="iv.vi.ii.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter IX</span>.—*That One of the
Cross-Bearers, who fled from his Post, was slain: while Another, who
faithfully stood his Ground, was preserved.*

<span id="iv.vi.ii.ix-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.ix-p2.1"></span>For</span> he said that once, during the
very heat of an engagement, a sudden tumult and panic attacked his army,
which threw the soldier who then bore the standard into an agony of
fear, so that he handed it over to another, in order to secure his own
escape from the battle. As soon, however, as his comrade had received
it, and he had withdrawn, and resigned all charge of the standard, he
was struck in the belly by a dart, which took his life. Thus he paid the
penalty of his cowardice and unfaithfulness, and lay dead on the spot:
but the other, who had taken his place as the bearer of the salutary
standard, found it to be the safeguard of his life. For though he was
assailed by a continual shower of darts, the bearer remained unhurt, the
staff of the standard receiving every weapon. It was indeed a truly
marvelous circumstance, that the enemies’ darts all fell within and
remained in the slender circumference of this spear, and thus saved the
standard-bearer from death; so that none of those engaged in this
service ever received a wound.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.ix-p3"></span>This story is none of mine, but for
this, <span id="fr_3168"></span>[3169](#fn_3168) too, I am indebted to
the emperor’s own authority, who related it in my hearing along with
other matters. And now, having thus through the power of God secured
these first victories, he put his forces in motion and continued his
onward march.
