<span id="iv.viii.v-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.viii.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.</span>

<span id="iv.viii.v-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iv.viii.v-p2.1"></span>But</span> whence has man this knowledge, and
who has ministered these truths to mortal ears? Or whence has a tongue
of flesh the power to speak of things so utterly distinct from fleshly
or material substance? Who has gazed on the invisible King, and beheld
these perfections in him? The bodily sense may comprehend elements and
their combinations, of a nature kindred to its own: but no one yet has
boasted to have scanned with corporeal eye that unseen kingdom which
governs all things nor has mortal nature yet discerned the beauty of
perfect wisdom. Who has beheld the face of righteousness through the
medium of flesh? And whence came the idea of legitimate sovereignty and
imperial power to man? Whence the thought of absolute dominion to a
being composed of flesh and blood? Who declared those ideas which are
invisible and undefined, and that incorporeal essence which has no
external form, to the mortals of this earth?

<span id="iv.viii.v-p3"></span>2. Surely there was but one interpreter
of these things; the all-pervading Word of God. <span
id="fr_3510"></span>[3511](#fn_3510.md) For he is the author of that
rational and intelligent being which exists in man; and, being himself
one with his Father’s Divine nature, he sheds upon his offspring the
out-flowings of his Father’s bounty. Hence the natural and untaught
powers of thought, which all men, Greeks or Barbarians, alike possess:
hence the perception of reason and wisdom, the seeds of integrity and
righteousness, the understanding of the arts of life, the knowledge of
virtue, the precious name of wisdom, and the noble love of philosophic
learning. Hence the knowledge of all that is great and good: hence
apprehension of God himself, and a life worthy of his worship: hence the
royal authority of man, and his invincible lordship over the creatures
of this world.

<span id="iv.viii.v-p5"></span>3. And when that Word, who is the Parent
of rational beings, had impressed a character on the mind of man
according to the image and likeness of God, <span
id="fr_3511"></span>[3512](#fn_3511.md) and had made him a royal creature,
in that he gave him alone of all earthly creatures capacity to rule and
to obey (as well as forethought and foreknowledge even here, concerning
the promised hope of his heavenly kingdom, because of which he himself
came, and, as the Parent of his children, disdained not to hold converse
with mortal men); he continued to cherish the seeds which himself had
sown, and renewed his gracious favors from above; holding forth to all
the promise of sharing his heavenly kingdom. Accordingly he called men,
and exhorted them to be ready for their heavenward journey, and to
provide themselves with the garment which became their calling. And by
an indescribable power he filled the world in every part with his
doctrine, expressing by the similitude of an earthly kingdom that
heavenly one to which he earnestly invites all mankind, and presents it
to them as a worthy object of their hope.

impresses the image of God on men, shows good philosophy and good
theology.
