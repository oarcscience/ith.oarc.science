id="iv.vi.iii.xlii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLII</span>.—*That the Empress
Helena,* <span id="fr_3273"></span>[3274](#fn_3273.md) *Constantine’s
Mother, having visited this Locality for Devotional Purposes, built
these Churches.*

<span id="iv.vi.iii.xlii-p3"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.xlii-p3.1"></span>For</span> she, having resolved to
discharge the duties of pious devotion to the God, the King of kings,
and feeling it incumbent on her to render thanksgivings with prayers on
behalf both of her own son, now so mighty an emperor, and of his sons,
her own grandchildren, the divinely favored Cæsars, though now advanced
in years, yet gifted with no common degree of wisdom, had hastened with
youthful alacrity to survey this venerable land; and at the same time to
visit the eastern provinces, cities, and people, with a truly imperial
solicitude. As soon, then, as she had rendered due reverence to the
ground which the Saviour’s feet had trodden, according to the prophetic
word which says <span id="fr_3274"></span>[3275](#fn_3274.md) “Let us
worship at the place whereon his feet have stood,” she immediately
bequeathed the fruit of her piety to future generations.
