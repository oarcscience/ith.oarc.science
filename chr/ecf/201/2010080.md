<span id="iii.viii.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.viii.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI.—</span>*Symeon rules the Church
of Jerusalem after James.*

<span id="iii.viii.xi-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.viii.xi-p2.1"></span>After</span> the martyrdom of James <span
id="fr_690"></span>[691](#fn_690.md) and the conquest of Jerusalem which
immediately followed, <span id="fr_691"></span>[692](#fn_691.md) it is said
that those of the apostles and disciples of the Lord that were still
living came together from all directions with those that were related to
the Lord according to the flesh <span id="fr_692"></span>[693](#fn_692.md)
(for the majority of them also were still alive) to take counsel as to
who was worthy to succeed James.

<span id="iii.viii.xi-p6"></span>2. They all with one consent pronounced
Symeon, <span id="fr_693"></span>[694](#fn_693.md) the son of Clopas, of
whom the Gospel also makes mention; <span
id="fr_694"></span>[695](#fn_694.md) to be worthy of the episcopal throne
of that parish. He was a cousin, as they say, of the Saviour. For
Hegesippus records that Clopas was a brother of Joseph. <span

<span id="iii.viii.xi-p4"></span> See *ibid.* note 40. The date of
Symeon’s accession (assuming that he did take charge of the Jerusalem
church as James had done) cannot be fixed. Eusebius himself, as he
informs us in Bk. IV. chap. 5, although he had a list of the Jerusalem
bishops, had no information as to the dates of their accession, or the
length of their incumbency. He puts Symeon’s accession after the
destruction of Jerusalem, but he evidently does that only because he
supposed that it followed immediately upon the death of James. Some
(e.g. Lightfoot) think it probable that Symeon was appointed immediately
after James’ death, therefore before the destruction of Jerusalem;
others (e.g. Renan) suppose that in Pella they had no bishop and
appointed Symeon only after the return of the church to Jerusalem.

<span id="fn_692"></span>[146:693](2010080.htm#fr_692.md) <span
id="iii.viii.xi-p4.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.xi-p5"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.viii.xi-p5.1"></span>λόγος κατέχει</span>. Hegesippus (quoted in
Bk. IV. chap. 22, below) says that “Symeon was appointed the second
bishop, whom all proposed as the cousin of our Lord.” Upon what
authority Eusebius’ more definite account rests we do not know. He
introduces it with the formula <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.viii.xi-p5.2"></span>λόγος κατέχει</span>, and we know of no
other author who has put it as he does. It may be that the simple
statement of Hegesippus was the sole ground of the more detailed
tradition which Eusebius repeats in this chapter. The reason of Symeon’s
appointment as given by Hegesippus is quite significant. It was the
common Oriental custom to accord the highest honors to all the members
of a prophet’s or religious leader’s family, and it was undoubtedly
owing chiefly to his close physical relationship to Christ that James
enjoyed such prominence and influence in the Jerusalem church,
apparently exceeding even that of the apostles themselves.

<span id="fn_693"></span>[146:694](2010080.htm#fr_693.md) <span
id="iii.viii.xi-p6.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.xi-p7"></span> This Symeon is to be distinguished
from the apostle Simon, the Canaanite, and also from Simon, the brother
of our Lord (mentioned in [Matt.
13:55](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#055.md), [Mark
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#003.md)<span
id="iii.viii.xi-p7.1"></span>). It is noticeable that Hegesippus nowhere
calls him the “brother of the Lord,” though he does give James that
title in Bk. II. chap. 23. Clopas is mentioned in [John xix.
25](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#025.md)<span id="iii.viii.xi-p7.2"></span>,
as the husband of Mary, who is without doubt identical with Mary the
mother of James (the little) and of Joses; mentioned in [Matt.
27:56](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#056.md), [Mark
15:40](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#040.md)<span
id="iii.viii.xi-p7.3"></span>, &c. If Hegesippus’ account be accepted as
trustworthy (and there is no reason for doubting it), Symeon was the son
of Clopas and Mary, and therefore brother of James the Little and Joses.
If, then, Alphæus and Clopas be the same, as many claim, James the
Little is to be identified with James the son of Alphæus, the apostle,
and hence the latter was the brother of Symeon. This identification,
however, is entirely arbitrary, and linguistically difficult, and we
shall do better therefore to keep the men separate, as Renan does (see
above, Bk. I. chap. 12, note 14). Upon the martyrdom of Symeon, see
below, chap. 32.

<span id="fn_694"></span>[146:695](2010080.htm#fr_694.md) <span
id="iii.viii.xi-p7.4"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.xi-p8"></span> In [John xix.
25](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#025.md)<span id="iii.viii.xi-p8.1"></span>

<span id="fn_695"></span>[146:696](2010080.htm#fr_695.md) <span
id="iii.viii.xi-p8.2"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.xi-p9"></span> Hegesippus, quoted below in Bk. IV.
chap. 22, calls Clopas the uncle of the Lord, which would make him of
course the brother or brother-in-law of Joseph. Eusebius evidently
considered them own brothers. Whether Hegesippus elsewhere stated this
directly, or whether Eusebius’ opinion is simply an inference from the
words of Hegesippus already referred to, we do not know. There is no
objection to the conclusion that Clopas and Joseph were own brothers,
although it cannot be proved from Hegesippus’ words that they were more
than brothers-in-law. From [John xix.
25](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#025.md)<span id="iii.viii.xi-p9.1"></span>
it is at any rate plain that their wives cannot have been own sisters,
as was formerly maintained by so many commentators. With the remaining
possibilities of relationship we do not need to concern ourselves.
