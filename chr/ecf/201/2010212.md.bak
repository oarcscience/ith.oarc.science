<span id="iii.xi.xlii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xi.xlii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLII.—</span>*Others of whom
Dionysius gives an Account.*

<span id="iii.xi.xlii-p2"></span>1. “<span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xi.xlii-p2.1"></span>Many</span> others, in cities and villages,
were torn asunder by the heathen, of whom I will mention one as an
illustration. Ischyrion <span id="fr_2097"></span>[2098](#fn_2097.md) was
employed as a steward by one of the rulers. His employer commanded him
to sacrifice, and on his refusal insulted him, and as he remained firm,
abused him. And as he still held out he seized a long staff and thrust
it through his bowels <span id="fr_2098"></span>[2099](#fn_2098.md) and
slew him.

<span id="iii.xi.xlii-p5"></span>2. “Why need I speak of the multitude
that wandered in the deserts and mountains, and perished by hunger, and
thirst, and cold, and sickness, and robbers, and wild beasts? Those of
them who survived are witnesses of their election and victory.

<span id="iii.xi.xlii-p6"></span>3. But I will relate one occurrence as
an example. Chæremon, <span id="fr_2099"></span>[2100](#fn_2099.md) who was
very old, was bishop of the city called Nilus. He fled with his
wife <span id="fr_2100"></span>[2101](#fn_2100.md) to the Arabian
mountain <span id="fr_2101"></span>[2102](#fn_2101.md) and did not return.
And though the brethren searched diligently they could not find either
them or their bodies.

<span id="iii.xi.xlii-p10"></span>4. And many who fled to the same
Arabian mountain were carried into slavery by the barbarian Saracens.
Some of them were ransomed with difficulty and at a large price; others
have not been to the present time. I have related these things, my
brother, not without an object, but that you may understand how many and
great distresses came upon us. Those indeed will understand them the
best who have had the largest experience of them.”

<span id="iii.xi.xlii-p11"></span>5. A little further on he adds: “These
divine martyrs among us, who now are seated with Christ, and are sharers
in his kingdom, partakers of his judgment and judges with him, received
some of the brethren who had fallen away and become chargeable with the
guilt of sacrificing. When they perceived that their conversion and
repentance were sufficient to be acceptable with him who by no means
desires the death of the sinner, but his repentance, having proved them
they received them back and brought them together, and met with them and
had fellowship with them in prayers and feasts. <span
id="fr_2102"></span>[2103](#fn_2102.md)

<span id="iii.xi.xlii-p13"></span>6. What counsel then, <span
id="page_286">p. 286</span> <span
id="iii.xi.xlii-Page_286"></span>brethren, do you give us concerning
such persons? What should we do? Shall we have the same judgment and
rule as theirs, and observe their decision and charity, and show mercy
to those whom they pitied? Or, shall we declare their decision
unrighteous, and set ourselves as judges of their opinion, and grieve
mercy and overturn order?” <span id="fr_2103"></span>[2104](#fn_2103.md)
These words Dionysius very properly added when making mention of those
who had been weak in the time of persecution.

<span id="iii.xi.xlii-p7"></span> Of the bishop Chæremon of Nilus we
know only what is told us here. The city Nilus or Nilopolis was situated
on an island in the Nile, in middle Egypt, some distance south of
Memphis.

<span id="iii.xi.xlii-p8"></span> <span class="Greek"><span

<span class="Greek"><span id="iii.xi.xlii-p8.2"></span>σύμβιος</span>,
which means a “companion” or “partner,” can signify nothing else than
“wife” as used here in the feminine.

<span id="iii.xi.xlii-p9"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xi.xlii-p9.1"></span>τὸ ᾽Αρ€βιον ὄρος</span>. The name *Arabicus
mons,* <span class="Greek"><span id="iii.xi.xlii-p9.2"></span>τὸ
᾽Αρ€βιον οὖρος</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xi.xlii-p9.3"></span>,</span> was given by Herodotus to the
range of mountains which separated that part of Arabia lying west of the
Arabian Gulf from the Nile valley (see Smith’s *Dict. of Greek and Rom.
Geography*).

<span id="fn_2102"></span>[285:2103](2010212.htm#fr_2102.md) <span
id="iii.xi.xlii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xi.xlii-p12"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xi.xlii-p12.1"></span>εἰσεδέξαντο καὶ συνήγαγον καὶ συνέστησαν
καὶ προσευχῶν αὐτοῖς καὶ ἑστι€σεων ἐκοινώνησαν</span>. It will be
observed that nothing is said here about joining with these persons in
celebrating the eucharist, or about admitting them to that service, and
hence Valesius is quite right in distinguishing the kind of communion
spoken of here from official communion in the church, around the Lord’s
table. Dionysius does not imply that these confessors had the power
given them to receive the lapsed back again into the Church, and to
dispense the eucharist to them. That was the prerogative of the bishop,
and evidently Dionysius has no thought of its being otherwise. The
communion of which he speaks was private fellowship merely, and implied
a recognition on the part of these confessors that the persons in
question had truly repented of their sin, and could be recommended for
readmission into the Church. As we see from chap. 44, §2, the
recommendation of these persons or of the people in general was quite
necessary, before the bishop would consent to absolve the fallen person
and receive him back again into the Church. And Dionysius’ words in this
passage show that he felt that the judgment of these confessors in
regard to the fitness of the lapsed for readmission ought to be received
with consideration, and have influence upon the final decision.
Dionysius thus shows great respect to the confessors, but does not
accord them the privileges which they claimed in some places (as we
learn from Tertullian’s *de Pudicitia,* 22, and from a number of
Cyprian’s *Epistles*) of themselves absolving the lapsed and readmitting
them to church communion. In this he showed again his agreement with
Cyprian and with the principles finally adopted in the Roman and
Carthaginian churches (cf. e.g. Cyprian’s *Epistles,* 9 sq., *al.* 15;
see also Dittrich, p. 51 sq.).

<span id="iii.xi.xlii-p14"></span> The object of the letter is clearly
revealed in these sentences (see chap. 41, note 1).
