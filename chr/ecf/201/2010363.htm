<p class="c33"><a name="iv.iii.iii.iii-p1"></A>  &sect;3. <i>Letters and Edicts.</i></p>  
<p><a name="iv.iii.iii.iii-p2"></A>It is hard to separate between letters, edicts, and laws. A substantial autocrat, the form of address was much the same, and the force. The extant letters are quite numerous, and those of which we have definite or general mention, many. He seems to have been a most industrious letter-writer. Of the extant letters a majority are undoubtedly or probably genuine. Some, however, need more critical study than seems to have been given to them.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3047"></A><A HREF="#fn_3047"><FONT SIZE="1">3048</FONT></A>
 Following is the roughly chronological list, the works being grouped by years. The dating is taken mainly from <A NAME="page_437"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 437</FONT></A> <a name="iv.iii.iii.iii-Page_437"></A>the Migne edition, Ceillier, and Valesius with slight original study. The descriptions are of course from the documents themselves.</p>  
<p><a name="iv.iii.iii.iii-p4"></A>1. (313 <span class="c13"><a name="iv.iii.iii.iii-p4.1"></A>a.d.</span>) <i>Edict of Constantine and Licinius for the restoration of the Church.</i> In Lact. <i>De M. P.</i> c. 48, and also in Euseb. <i>H. E.</i> 10. 5 (Op. Const. ed. Migne, 105&#8211;110). The second edict of toleration. The first edict (Euseb. 8. 17; Lact. <i>De M. P.</i> 34) can hardly be classed among the &#8220;writings&#8221; of Constantine. This famous second edict grants full religious liberty to the Christians and restoration of their property. Compare section on <i>Acts of Toleration</i> in Wordworth&#146;s <i>Constantinus.</i></p>  
<p><a name="iv.iii.iii.iii-p5"></A>2. (313.) <i>First letter of Constantine and Licinius to Anulinus.</i> In Euseb. <i>H. E.</i> 10. 5 (Op. Const. ed. Migne, 479&#8211;480). Restores goods to the Catholic Christians; written about the same time as the edict of toleration, according to Ceillier.</p>  
<p><a name="iv.iii.iii.iii-p6"></A>3. (313.) <i>Second Letter of Constantine to Anulinus.</i> In Euseb. <i>H. E.</i> 10. 7 (Op. Const. 481&#8211;2). Ordering that the Catholic clergy be free from public service, that they might not be disturbed in their worship of God.</p>  
<p><a name="iv.iii.iii.iii-p7"></A>4. (313.) <i>Letter of Constantine to C&aelig;cilianus.</i> In Euseb. <i>H. E.</i> 10. 6 (Op. Const. 481&#8211;4). Presents money&#8212;three thousand purses (folles)&#8212;to be distributed according to direction of Hosius.</p>  
<p><a name="iv.iii.iii.iii-p8"></A>5. (313.) <i>Letter of Constantine to Melchiades (or Miltiades).</i> In Euseb. <i>H. E.</i> 10. 5 (Op. Const. 477- ). Having received various letters from Anulinus regarding C&aelig;cilian and the Donatists, he summons a council at Rome to consider the matter.</p>  
<p><a name="iv.iii.iii.iii-p9"></A>6. (314.) <i>Letter of Constantine to Ablavius (or &AElig;lafius).</i> In Optat. <i>Mon. vet</i>. p. 283&#8211;4 (Op. Const. 483&#8211;6). The result of the council at Rome not having proved final, he summons the Council of Arles.</p>  
<p><a name="iv.iii.iii.iii-p10"></A>7. (314.) <i>Letter of Constantine to Chrestus (Crescentius), bishop of Syracuse.</i> In Euseb. <i>H. E.</i> 10. 5 (Op. Const. 485&#8211;8). Invites to the Council of Arles.</p>  
<p><a name="iv.iii.iii.iii-p11"></A>8. (314.) <i>Letter of Constantine to the Bishops after the Council of Arles.</i> In Optat. <i>Mon. vet.</i> p. 287&#8211;8 (Op. Const. 487&#8211;90). Contains gratulations, reprobations of obstinate schismatists, and exhortations to patience with such obstinateness. It is full of religious expressions, and if genuine, is a most interesting exhibition of Constantine&#146;s religious position at this time, but it looks suspicious, and probably is not genuine.</p>  
<p><a name="iv.iii.iii.iii-p12"></A>9. (314) <i>Letter of Constantine and Licinius to Probianus, the Proconsul of Africa.</i> In Augustine, <i>Ep.</i> 88 (ed. Migne 33 [1865] 3045), and also in <i>Contr. Cresc</i>. (43 [1861] 540, also in Op. Const. and tr. Engl. in Schaff, <i>Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers,</i> 1, p. 370). Orders that the Donatist Ingentius be brought to his court. One text adds Maximianus or Maximus in place of Maximus as epithet of Constantine.</p>  
<p><a name="iv.iii.iii.iii-p13"></A>10. (314 or 315.) <i>Letter of Constantine to the Donatist Bishops.</i> In Optat. <i>Mon. vet.</i> p. 290 (Op. Const. ed. Migne [1844] 490). As the Donatists were not yet satisfied, he summons them to meet C&aelig;cilian, and promises if they convict him in one particular, it shall be as if in all.</p>  
<p><a name="iv.iii.iii.iii-p14"></A>11. (315.) <i>Letter of Constantine to Celsus.</i> In Optat. <i>Mon. vet</i> p. 291 (Op. Const. 489&#8211;90). In reply to letter mentioning disturbances of the Donatists, he hints that he expects to go shortly to Africa and settle things summarily.</p>  
<p><a name="iv.iii.iii.iii-p15"></A>12. (315.) <i>Fragment of a Letter of Constantine to Eumalius Vicarius.</i> In Augustine&#146;s <i>Contr. Crest</i>. 3. 71 (ed. Migne 43 [1861] 541; also Op. Const. 491&#8211;2). An extract of six lines, in which he says C&aelig;cilianus was entirely innocent.</p>  
<p><a name="iv.iii.iii.iii-p16"></A>13. (316 or 317.) <i>Letter of Constantine to the bishops and people of Africa.</i> Optat. <i>Mon. vet.</i> p. 294 (Op. Const. 491&#8211;2). He has tried every way to settle the Donatist disturbances in vain, and now leaves them to God and advises patience.</p>

<p><a name="iv.iii.iii.iii-p18"></A><A NAME="page_438"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 438</FONT></A> <a name="iv.iii.iii.iii-Page_438"></A>15. (323 <span class="c13"><a name="iv.iii.iii.iii-p18.1"></A>a.d.</span>) <i>Law of Constantine respecting piety toward God and the Christian Religion</i> (Ad prov. Pal.). In Euseb. <i>V. C</i>. 2. 24&#8211;42; abstr. in Soz. 1. 8 (Op. Const. 253&#8211;282). This long edict, addressed to the inhabitants of Palestine, contains an exposition of the prosperity which attends the righteous and the adversity which comes to the wicked, followed by edict for the restitution of confiscated property, the recall of exiles, and various other rectifications of injustices. This is the copy, &#8220;or letter,&#8221; sent to the heathen population of the empire.</p>  
<p><a name="iv.iii.iii.iii-p19"></A>16. (324.) <i>Constantine&#146;s edict to the people of the eastern provinces concerning the error of polytheism,</i> &amp;c. (Ad. prov. Or). In Euseb. <i>V. C</i>. 48&#8211; . This letter, written in Latin and translated by Eusebius, begins with &#8220;some general remarks on virtue and vice,&#8221; touches on the persecutions and the fate of the persecutors, expresses the wish that all would become Christians, praises God, and exhorts concord.</p>  
<p><a name="iv.iii.iii.iii-p20"></A>17. (323 or 324.) <i>Letter of Constantine to Alexander the Bishop and Arius the Presbyter.</i> In Euseb. <i>V. C</i>. 2. 64&#8211;72; Gelas. 2. 4; Socr. 1. 7 (Op. Const. 493&#8211;502). Expresses his desire for peace, his hope that they might have helped him in the Donatist troubles, his distress at finding that they, too, were in a broil, his opinion that the matters under discussion are of little moment, and what he thinks they are. He exhorts to unanimity, repeats his opinion that the matters are of little moment, mentions his &#8220;copious and constant tears,&#8221; and finally gets through.</p>  
<p><a name="iv.iii.iii.iii-p21"></A>18. (324&#8211;5.) <i>Letter to Porphyrius</i> (Optatian). In Migne, <i>Patrol. Lat.</i> 19 [1846] 393&#8211;394 and in various editions of Optatian. This letter to Porphyrius or Optatian was on the occasion of the sending of a poem by the latter for his vicennalia. It expresses his pleasure and his disposition to encourage the cultivation of <i>belles lettres.</i> Compare note on Optatian under sources.</p>  
<p><a name="iv.iii.iii.iii-p22"></A>19. (325.) <i>Letter of Constantine the King, summoning the bishops to Nic&aelig;a.</i> In Cowper, <i>Syriac Misc.,</i> Lond. 1841, p. 5&#8211;6. This is translated from a Syriac <span class="c13"><a name="iv.iii.iii.iii-p22.1"></A>ms.</span> in the British Museum, written in 501. Gives as reason for the choice of Nic&aelig;a the convenience for the European bishops and &#8220;the excellent temperature of the air.&#8221; This, if genuine, is the letter mentioned by Eusebius, <i>V. C</i>., but it looks suspicious.</p>  
<p><a name="iv.iii.iii.iii-p23"></A>20. (325.) <i>Letter of Constantine to the churches after the Council of Nic&aelig;a.</i> In Euseb. <i>V. C</i>. 3. 17&#8211;20; Socr. 1. 9 (Op. Const. 501&#8211;506). Dwells on the harmonious result, especially respecting the Easter controversy, and commends to the bishops to observe what the Council has decreed.</p>

<p><a name="iv.iii.iii.iii-p25"></A>22. (325.) <i>Letter of Constantine to Arius and the Arians.</i> In &#8220;Conc. 2. 269.&#8221; A long and rather railing address against Arius.</p>  
<p><a name="iv.iii.iii.iii-p26"></A>23. (325.) <i>Letter of Constantine to the churches.</i> In Socr. <i>H. E.</i> 1. 9.

Constantine and his sons write as to a father.

<p><a name="iv.iii.iii.iii-p45"></A>42. (335.) <i>A Letter to Dalmatius</i> is mentioned by Athanasius, <i>Apol</i>. 5. 13, but not preserved (Op. Const. 563&#8211;564; Tr. Engl. in Athan. <i>Hist. Tracts</i>, Oxf. 1850, p. 94). It required him to make judicial enquiry respecting the charge against Athanasius of the murder of Arsenius.</p>

<p class="c105"><a name="iv.iii.iii.iii-p48"></A>Besides these there are the clearly spurious:</p>  
<p><a name="iv.iii.iii.iii-p49"></A>1. <i>Letter of Helena to Constantine</i> (Op. Const. 529&#8211;530).</p>  
<p><a name="iv.iii.iii.iii-p50"></A>2. <i>Letter of Constantine in response to Helena</i> (Op. Const. 529&#8211;532).</p>  
<p><a name="iv.iii.iii.iii-p51"></A>3. <i>Treaty of peace between Constantine, Sylvester and Tiridates</i> (Op. Const. 579&#8211;582).

C.</i> 3. 24) of which there is no specific knowledge. Of the former may be mentioned that <i>to the inhabitants of Heliopolis</i>, one to Valerius (or Valerianus or Verinus) (Augustine, <i>Ad Donat. p. c</i>. c. 33); one <i>to the Council of Tyre</i>, asking them to hasten to Jerusalem (<i>V. C</i>. 4. 43; Soz. 2. 26); and one acknowledging the copies of the Scriptures prepared at his order, through Eusebius (<i>V. C</i>. 4. 37).</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="iv.iii.iii.iii-p3"></A> There is of course more or less critical treatment of various letters in critical works on Donatism or Arianism or other special topics. Since writing the above, the exceedingly interesting analysis of sources for early Donatist history, by Seeck, in Briegers&#146; <i>Ztschr. f. Kirchenges.,</i> 1889, has been examined. He has, like V&ouml;lter and Deutsch before him, admirable critical studies of certain letters. But a systematic critical study of the Constantinian letters as a whole seem to be still lacking.</p>
