<span id="iv.vi.iv.xxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.xxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVII</span>.—*Among Other
Enactments, he decrees that no Christian shall slave to a Jew, and
affirms the Validity of the Decisions of Councils.*

<span id="iv.vi.iv.xxvii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.xxvii-p2.1"></span>He</span> also passed a law to the
effect that no Christian should remain in servitude to a Jewish master,
on the ground that it could not be right that those whom the Saviour had
ransomed should be subjected to the yoke of slavery by a people who had
slain the prophets and the Lord himself. If any were found hereafter in
these circumstances, the slave was to be set at liberty, and the master
punished by a fine.

<span id="iv.vi.iv.xxvii-p3"></span>He likewise added the sanction of
his authority to the decisions of bishops passed at their synods, and
forbade the provincial governors to annul any of their decrees: for he
rated the priests of God at a higher value than any judge whatever.
These and a thousand similar provisions did he enact for the benefit of
his subjects; but there is not time now to give a special description of
them, such as might convey an accurate idea of his imperial wisdom in
these respects: nor need I now relate at length, how, as a devoted
servant of the Supreme God, he employed himself from morning until night
in seeking objects for his beneficence, and how equally and universally
kind he was to all.
