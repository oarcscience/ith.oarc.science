<span id="iv.vi.i.xl-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.xl-p1.1"></span>Chapter XL</span>.—*Of the Statue of
Constantine holding a Cross, and its Inscription.*

<span id="iv.vi.i.xl-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.xl-p2.1"></span>Moreover</span>, by loud proclamation and
monumental inscriptions he made known to all men the salutary symbol,
setting up this great trophy of victory over his enemies in the midst of
the imperial city, and expressly causing it to be engraven in indelible
characters, that the salutary symbol was the safeguard of the Roman
government and of the entire empire. Accordingly, he immediately ordered
a lofty spear in the figure of a cross to be placed beneath the hand of
a statue representing himself, in the most frequented part of Rome, and
the following inscription to be engraved on it in the Latin language:
<span class="c13"><span id="iv.vi.i.xl-p2.2"></span>by virtue of this
salutary sign, which is the true test of valor, I have preserved and
liberated your city from the yoke of tyranny. I have also set at liberty
the roman senate and people, and restored them to their ancient
distinction and splendor</span>. <span

<span id="iv.vi.i.xl-p3"></span> Compare the *Church History,* 9. 9.

<span id="iv.vi.i.xl-p4"></span>If it be true, as Crusè says, that in
this inscription there are traces of the Latin original, it gives a
strong presumption that Eusebius was quoting a really existing
inscription and accordingly that it is genuine. If so, of course the
probability of the vision of the cross is greatly increased.
