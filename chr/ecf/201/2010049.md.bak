id="iii.vii.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII.—</span>*Pilate’s Suicide.*

<span id="iii.vii.viii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.vii.viii-p2.1"></span>It</span> is worthy of note that Pilate
himself, who was governor in the time of our Saviour, is reported to
have fallen into such misfortunes under Caius, whose times we are
recording, that he was forced to become his own murderer and
executioner; <span id="fr_322"></span>[323](#fn_322.md) and thus divine
vengeance, as it seems, was not long in overtaking him. This is stated
by those Greek historians who have recorded the Olympiads, together with
the respective events which have taken place in each period. <span

<span id="iii.vii.viii-p3"></span> Pilate’s downfall occurred in the
following manner. A leader of the Samaritans had promised to disclose
the sacred treasures which Moses was reported to have concealed upon Mt.
Gerizim, and the Samaritans came together in great numbers from all
quarters. Pilate, supposing the gathering to be with rebellious purpose,
sent troops against them and defeated them with great slaughter. The
Samaritans complained to Vitellius, governor of Syria, who sent Pilate
to Rome (36 <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.vii.viii-p3.1"></span>a.d.</span>) to answer the charges brought
against him. Upon reaching Rome he found Tiberius dead and Caius upon
the throne. He was unsuccessful in his attempt to defend himself, and,
according to tradition, was banished to Vienne in Gaul, where a monument
is still shown as Pilate’s tomb. According to another tradition he
committed suicide upon the mountain near Lake Lucerne, which bears his
name.

<span id="iii.vii.viii-p4"></span> Eusebius, unfortunately, does not
mention his authority in this case, and the end of Pilate is recorded by
no Greek historians known to us. We are unable, therefore, to form a
judgment as to the trustworthiness of the account.
