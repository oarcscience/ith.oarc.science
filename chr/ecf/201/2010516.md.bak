<span id="iv.vi.ii.lxxi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.lxxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter LXXI</span>.—*There should be no
Contention in Matters which are in themselves of Little Moment.*

<span id="iv.vi.ii.lxxi-p2"></span>“<span class="c13"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.lxxi-p2.1"></span>For</span> as long as you continue to
contend about these small and very insignificant questions, it is not
fitting that so large a portion of God’s people should be under the
direction of your judgment, since you are thus divided between
yourselves. I believe it indeed to be not merely unbecoming, but
positively evil, that such should be the case. But I will refresh your
minds by a little illustration, as follows. You know that philosophers,
though they all adhere to one system, are yet frequently at issue on
certain points, and differ, perhaps, in their degree of knowledge: yet
they are recalled to harmony of sentiment by the uniting power of their
common doctrines. If this be true, is it not far more reasonable that
you, who are the ministers of the Supreme God, should be of one mind
respecting the profession of the same religion? But let us still more
thoughtfully and with closer attention examine what I have said, and see
whether it be right that, on the ground of some trifling and foolish
verbal difference between ourselves, brethren should assume towards each
other the attitude of enemies, and the august meeting of the Synod be
rent by profane disunion, because of you who wrangle together on points
so trivial and altogether unessential? This is vulgar, and rather
characteristic of childish ignorance, than consistent with the wisdom of
priests and men of sense. Let us withdraw ourselves with a good will
from these temptations of the devil. Our great God and common Saviour of
all has granted the same light to us all. Permit me, who am his servant,
to bring my task to a successful issue, under the direction of his
Providence, that I may be enabled, through my exhortations, and
diligence, and earnest admonition, to recall his people to communion and
fellowship. For since you have, as I said, but one faith, and one
sentiment respecting our religion, and since the Divine commandment in
all its parts enjoins on us all the duty of maintaining a spirit of
concord, let not the circumstance which has led to a slight difference
between you, since it does not affect the validity of the whole, cause
any division or schism among you. And this I say without in any way
desiring to force you to entire unity of judgment in regard to this
truly idle question, whatever its real nature may be. For the dignity of
your synod may be preserved, and the communion of your whole body
maintained unbroken, however wide a difference may exist among you as to
unimportant matters. For we are not all of us like-minded on every
subject, <span id="page_518">p. 518</span> <span
id="iv.vi.ii.lxxi-Page_518"></span>nor is there such a thing as one
disposition and judgment common to all alike. As far, then, as regards
the Divine Providence, let there be one faith, and one understanding
among you, one united judgment in reference to God. But as to your
subtle disputations on questions of little or no significance, though
you may be unable to harmonize in sentiment, such differences should be
consigned to the secret custody of your own minds and thoughts. And now,
let the preciousness of common affection, let faith in the truth, let
the honor due to God and to the observance of his law continue immovably
among you. Resume, then, your mutual feelings of friendship, love, and
regard: restore to the people their wonted embracings; and do ye
yourselves, having purified your souls, as it were, once more
acknowledge one another. For it often happens that when a reconciliation
is effected by the removal of the causes of enmity, friendship becomes
even sweeter than it was before.
