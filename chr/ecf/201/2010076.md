<span id="iii.viii.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.viii.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII.</span>—*The Predictions of
Christ.*

<span id="iii.viii.vii-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.viii.vii-p2.1"></span>It</span> is fitting to add to these
accounts the true prediction of our Saviour in which he foretold these
very events.

<span id="iii.viii.vii-p3"></span>2. His words are as follows: <span
id="fr_643"></span>[644](#fn_643.md) “Woe unto them that are with child,
and to them that give suck in those days! But pray ye that your flight
be not in the winter, neither on the Sabbath day. For there shall be
great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to
this time, no, nor ever shall be.”

<span id="iii.viii.vii-p5"></span>3. The historian, reckoning the whole
number of the slain, says that eleven hundred thousand persons perished
by famine and sword, <span id="fr_644"></span>[645](#fn_644.md) and that
the rest of the rioters and robbers, being betrayed by each other after
the taking of the city, were slain. <span
id="fr_645"></span>[646](#fn_645.md) But the tallest of the youths and
those that were distinguished for beauty were preserved for the triumph.
Of the rest of the multitude, those that were over seventeen years of
age were sent as prisoners to labor in the works of Egypt, <span
id="fr_646"></span>[647](#fn_646.md) while still more were scattered
through the provinces to meet their death in the theaters by the sword
and by beasts. Those under seventeen years of age were carried away to
be sold as slaves, and of these alone the number reached ninety
thousand. <span id="fr_647"></span>[648](#fn_647.md)

<span id="iii.viii.vii-p10"></span>4. These things took place in this
manner in the second year of the reign of Vespasian, <span
id="fr_648"></span>[649](#fn_648.md) in accordance with the prophecies of
our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, who by divine power saw them
beforehand as if they were already present, and wept and mourned
according to the statement of the holy evangelists, who give the very
words which he uttered, when, as if addressing Jerusalem herself, he
said: <span id="fr_649"></span>[650](#fn_649.md)

<span id="iii.viii.vii-p13"></span>5. “If thou hadst known, even thou,
in this day, the things which belong unto thy peace! But now they are
hid from thine eyes. For the days shall come upon thee, that thine
enemies shall cast a rampart about thee, and compass thee round, and
keep thee in on every side, and shall lay thee and thy children even
with the ground.”

<span id="iii.viii.vii-p14"></span>6. And then, as if speaking
concerning the people, he says, <span id="fr_650"></span>[651](#fn_650.md)
“For there shall be great distress in the land, and wrath upon this
people. And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led
away captive into all nations. And Jerusalem shall be trodden down of
the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.” And
again: <span id="fr_651"></span>[652](#fn_651.md) “When ye shall see
Jerusalem com<span id="page_142">p. 142</span> <span
id="iii.viii.vii-Page_142"></span>passed with armies, then know that the
desolation thereof is nigh.”

<span id="iii.viii.vii-p17"></span>7. If any one compares the words of
our Saviour with the other accounts of the historian concerning the
whole war, how can one fail to wonder, and to admit that the
foreknowledge and the prophecy of our Saviour were truly divine and
marvellously strange. <span id="fr_652"></span>[653](#fn_652.md)

<span id="iii.viii.vii-p19"></span>8. Concerning those calamities, then,
that befell the whole Jewish nation after the Saviour’s passion and
after the words which the multitude of the Jews uttered, when they
begged the release of the robber and murderer, but besought that the
Prince of Life should be taken from their midst, <span
id="fr_653"></span>[654](#fn_653.md) it is not necessary to add anything to
the account of the historian.

<span id="iii.viii.vii-p21"></span>9. But it may be proper to mention
also those events which exhibited the graciousness of that all-good
Providence which held back their destruction full forty years after
their crime against Christ,—during which time many of the apostles and
disciples, and James himself the first bishop there, the one who is
called the brother of the Lord, <span id="fr_654"></span>[655](#fn_654.md)
were still alive, and dwelling in Jerusalem itself, remained the surest
bulwark of the place. Divine Providence thus still proved itself
long-suffering toward them in order to see whether by repentance for
what they had done they might obtain pardon and salvation; and in
addition to such long-suffering, Providence also furnished wonderful
signs of the things which were about to happen to them if they did not
repent.

<span id="iii.viii.vii-p23"></span>10. Since these matters have been
thought worthy of mention by the historian already cited, we cannot do
better than to recount them for the benefit of the readers of this work.

<span id="iii.viii.vii-p6"></span> Josephus, *B. J.* Bk. VI. chap. 9,
§3. Josephus simply says that the whole number of those that perished
during the siege was 1,100,000; he does not specify the manner of their
death. On the accuracy of the numbers which he gives, see above, chap.
5, note 13.

id="iii.viii.vii-p8.1"></span>εἰς τὰ κατ᾽ ῎Αιγυπτον žργα</span>. The
works meant are the great stone quarries of Egypt (commonly called the
mines of Egypt), which furnished a considerable part of the finest
marble used for building purposes in Rome and elsewhere. The quarries
were chiefly in the hands of the Roman government, and the work of
quarrying was done largely by captives taken in war, as in the present
case.

<span id="fn_647"></span>[141:648](2010076.htm#fr_647.md) <span
id="iii.viii.vii-p8.2"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.vii-p9"></span> Josephus does not say that the number
of those sold as slaves was upward of 90,000, as Eusebius asserts, but
simply (*ibid.* §3) that the number of captives taken during the whole
war was 97,000, a number which Eusebius, through an error, applies to
the one class of prisoners that were sold as slaves.

<span id="iii.viii.vii-p11"></span> In *B. J.* Bk. VI. 8. 5 and 10. 1
Josephus puts the completion of the siege on the eighth of the month
Elul (September), and in the second passage he puts it in the second
year of Vespasian. Vespasian was proclaimed emperor in Egypt July 1, 69,
so that Sept. 8 of his second year would be Sept. 8, <span
class="c13"><span id="iii.viii.vii-p11.1"></span>a.d.</span> 70. (Cf.

<span id="iii.viii.vii-p18"></span> It is but right to remark that not
merely the negative school of critics, but even many conservative
scholars (e.g. Weiss) put the composition of the Gospel of Luke after
the year 70, because its eschatological discourses seem to bear the mark
of having been recorded after the fulfillment of the prediction,
differing as they do in many minor particulars from the accounts of the
same discourses in Matthew and Mark. To cite a single instance: in the
passage quoted just above from [Luke xxi.
20](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#020.md)<span
id="iii.viii.vii-p18.1"></span>, the armies encompassing Jerusalem are
mentioned, while in parallel passages in the other Gospels ([Matt.
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#015.md), [Mark
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#014.md)<span
id="iii.viii.vii-p18.2"></span>[Mark xiii.
14](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#014.md)<span
id="iii.viii.vii-p18.3"></span>) not armies, but “the abomination of
desolation standing in the holy place” is spoken of as the sign. Compare
the various commentaries upon these passages.
