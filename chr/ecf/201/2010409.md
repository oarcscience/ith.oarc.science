of God that Constantine became possessed of the Empire.*

<span id="iv.vi.i.xxiv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.xxiv-p2.1"></span>Thus</span> then the God of all, the
Supreme Governor of the whole universe, by his own will appointed
Constantine, the descendant of so renowned a parent, to be prince and
sovereign: so that, while others have been raised to this distinction by
the election of their fellow-men, he is the only one to whose elevation
no mortal may boast of having contributed.
