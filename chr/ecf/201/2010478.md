id="iv.vi.ii.xxxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXIII</span>.—*Concerning
those Confessors engaged in Military Service.*

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xxxiii-p2"></span>“<span class="c13"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.xxxiii-p2.1"></span>Once</span> more, with respect to those
who had previously been preferred to any military distinction, of which
they were afterwards deprived, for the cruel and unjust reason that they
chose rather to acknowledge their allegiance to God than to retain the
rank they held; we leave them perfect liberty of choice, either to
occupy their former stations, should they be content again to engage in
military service, or after an honorable discharge, to live in
undisturbed tranquillity. For it is fair and consistent that men who
have displayed such magnanimity and fortitude in meeting the perils to
which they have been exposed, should be allowed the choice either of
enjoying peaceful leisure, or resuming their former rank.
