id="iv.vi.i.xxxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXIX</span>.—*Constantine’s
Entry into Rome.*

<span id="iv.vi.i.xxxix-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.xxxix-p2.1"></span>Having</span> then at this time sung
these and suchlike praises to God, the Ruler of all and the Author of
victory, after the example of his great servant Moses, Constantine
entered the imperial city in triumph. And here the whole body of the
senate, and others of rank and distinction in the city, freed as it were
from the restraint of a prison, along with the whole Roman populace,
their countenances expressive of the gladness of their hearts, received
him with acclamations and abounding joy; men, women, and children, with
countless multitudes of servants, greeting him as deliverer, preserver,
and benefactor, with incessant shouts. But he, being possessed of inward
piety toward God, was neither rendered arrogant by these plaudits, nor
uplifted by the praises he heard: <span

received help from God, he immediately rendered a thanksgiving to him as
the Author of his victory.
