<span id="iv.vi.iv.lxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.lxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter LXVIII</span>.—*Resolution of
the Army to confer thence-forward the Title of Augustus on his Sons.*

<span id="iv.vi.iv.lxviii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.lxviii-p2.1"></span>Meanwhile</span> the tribunes selected
from the troops under their command those officers whose fidelity and
zeal had long been known to the emperor, and dispatched them to the
Cæsars <span id="page_558">p. 558</span> <span
id="iv.vi.iv.lxviii-Page_558"></span>with intelligence of the late
event. This service they accordingly performed. As soon, however, as the
soldiery throughout the provinces received the tidings of the emperor’s
decease, they all, as if by a supernatural impulse, resolved with one
consent, as though their great emperor had been yet alive, to
acknowledge none other than his sons as sovereigns of the Roman world:
and these they soon after determined should no longer retain the name of
Cæsar, but should each be honored with the title of Augustus, a name
which indicates the highest supremacy of imperial power. Such were the
measures adopted by the army; and these resolutions they communicated to
each other by letter, so that the unanimous desire of the legions became
known at the same point of time throughout the whole extent of the
empire.
