<span id="iv.iii.ii.i-p4"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.iii.ii.i-p4.1"></span>A man’s</span> character consists of an
inherited personality enlarged, modified, or disfigured by his own
repeated voluntary acts. A sufficiently exhaustive survey of such
character may be made under the rubrics of: 1. Inherited
characteristics. 2. Physical characteristics. 3. Mental characteristics.
4. Moral characteristics. 5. Religious characteristics.

<span id="iv.iii.ii.i-p5"></span>The character of Constantine has been
so endlessly treated, with such utter lack of agreement, that it seems
hopeless to try to reach any clear results in a study of it. “Who shall
decide when doctors disagree?” “How shall I go about it to find what
sort of a man Constantine really was?” Certainly nothing can be gained
by that method which chooses a few acts or characteristics to which
shifting tests of various philosophies are applied. Nor can any
haphazard selection and stringing together of traits give what is by its
nature a synthesis of them all. Like any other scientific study, the
first condition of method is that it be systematic. Then, a character
generalization is worth just so much, no more, as the grounds on which
it is based. To get a man’s character from secondary sources, from other
men’s generalizations, is a hopelessly will-of-the-wisp effort. Again,
another vice of characterization as usually practised is the
interpretation of the whole by a part rather than the part by the whole.
The individual act is thus made the standard of character. To get at
what this personality called Constantine was therefore requires a
systematic survey of the primary sources with a view to getting the
*ensemble* that the eccentric may be judged by the normal. In such
survey the main thing is the body of analyzed and grouped facts. The
editor’s summary, like any summary, is worth only what the facts are
worth. This method, however imperfectly carried out, is at least better
than rambling observations of incoherent phenomena; and has therefore
been adopted in this attempt to find out what sort of a man this
Constantine was; Physically, Mentally, Morally, Spiritually.
