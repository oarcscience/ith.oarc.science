<span id="iv.vi.iv.lii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.lii-p1.1"></span>Chapter LII</span>.—*That after they had
reached Man’s Estate he was their Guide in Piety.*

<span id="iv.vi.iv.lii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.lii-p2.1"></span>As</span> long as the Cæsars were of
tender years, they were aided by suitable advisers in the management of
public affairs; but on their arrival at the age of manhood their
father’s instructions alone sufficed. When present he proposed to them
his own example, and admonished them to follow his pious course: in
their absence he furnished them by letter with rules of conduct suited
to their imperial station, the first and greatest of which was an
exhortation to value the knowledge and worship of the Sovereign Lord of
all more than wealth, nay, more than empire itself. At length he
permitted them to direct the public administration of the empire without
control, making it his first request that they would care for the
interests of the Church of God, and boldly profess themselves disciples
of Christ. Thus trained, and excited to obedience not so much by precept
as by their own voluntary desire for virtue, his sons more than
fulfilled the admonitions of their father, devoting their earnest
attention to the service of God, and observing the ordinances of the
Church even in the palace itself, with all the members of their
households. <span id="fr_3349"></span>[3350](#fn_3349) For their
father’s forethought had provided that all the attendants of his son’s
should be Christians. And not only so, but the military officers of
highest rank, and those who had the control of public business, were
professors of the same faith: for the emperor placed confidence in the
fidelity of men devoted to the service of God, as in a strong and sure
defense. When our thrice blessed prince had completed these
arrangements, and thus secured order and tranquillity throughout the
empire, God, the dispenser of all blessings, judged it to be the fitting
<span id="page_554">p. 554</span> <span

inheritance, and summoned him to pay the debt of nature.
