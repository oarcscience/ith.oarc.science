<span id="iv.vi.i.xxii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXII</span>.—*How, after the
Burial of Constantius, Constantine was Proclaimed Augustus by the Army.*

<span id="iv.vi.i.xxii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.xxii-p2.1"></span>Nor</span> did the imperial throne remain
long unoccupied: for Constantine invested himself with his father’s
purple, and proceeded from his father’s palace, presenting to all a
renewal, as it were, in his own person, of his father’s life and reign.
He then conducted the funeral procession in company with his father’s
friends, some preceding, others following the train, and performed the
last offices for the pious deceased with an extraordinary degree of
magnificence, and all united in honoring this thrice blessed prince with
acclamations and praises, and while with one mind and voice, they
glorified the rule of the son as a living again of him who was dead,
they hastened at once to hail their new sovereign by the titles of
Imperial and Worshipful Augustus, with joyful shouts. <span
id="fr_3098"></span>[3099](#fn_3098) Thus the memory of the deceased
emperor received honor from the praises bestowed upon his son, while the
latter was pronounced blessed in being the successor of such a father.
All the nations also under his dominion were filled with joy and
inexpressible gladness at not being even for a moment deprived of the
benefits of a well ordered government.

<span id="iv.vi.i.xxii-p4"></span>In the instance of the Emperor
Constantius, God has made manifest to our generation what the end of
those is who in their lives have honored and loved him.

once. Galerius refused him the title of emperor, and he contented
himself with that of Cæsar for a little. Compare Prolegomena.
