id="iv.vi.iii.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIV</span>.—*How he wrote
Frequent Letters of a Religious Character to the Bishops and People.*

<span id="iv.vi.iii.xxiv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.xxiv-p2.1"></span>But</span> besides these, his writings
are very numerous on kindred subjects, and he was the author of a
multitude of letters, some to the bishops, in which he laid injunctions
on them tending to the advantage of the churches of God; and sometimes
the thrice blessed one addressed the people of the churches generally,
calling them his own brethren and fellow-servants. But perhaps we may
hereafter find leisure to collect these despatches in a separate form,
in order that the integrity of our present history may not be impaired
by their insertion.
