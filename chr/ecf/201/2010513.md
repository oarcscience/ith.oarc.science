<span id="iv.vi.ii.lxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.lxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter LXVIII</span>.—*Being grieved
by the Dissension, he counsels Peace.*

<span id="iv.vi.ii.lxviii-p2"></span>“<span class="c13"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.lxviii-p2.1"></span>But</span>, O glorious Providence of
God! how deep a wound did not my ears only, but my very heart receive in
the report that divisions existed among yourselves more grievous still
than those which continued in that country! <span
id="fr_3213"></span>[3214](#fn_3213) so that you, through whose aid I
had hoped to procure a remedy for the errors of others, are in a state
which needs healing even more than theirs. And yet, having made a
careful enquiry into the origin and foundation of these differences, I
find the cause to be of a truly insignificant character, and quite
unworthy of such fierce contention. Feeling myself, therefore, compelled
to address you in this letter, and to appeal at the same time to your
unanimity <span id="fr_3214"></span>[3215](#fn_3214) and sagacity, I
call on Divine Providence to assist me in the task, while I interrupt
your dissension in the character of a minister of peace. And with
reason: for if I might expect, with the help of a higher Power, to be
able without difficulty, by a judicious appeal to the pious feelings of
those who heard me, to recall them to a better spirit, even though the
occasion of the disagreement were a greater one, how can I refrain from
promising myself a far easier and more speedy adjustment of this
difference, when the cause which hinders general harmony of sentiment is
intrinsically trifling and of little moment?
