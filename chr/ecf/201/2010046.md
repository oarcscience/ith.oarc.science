<span id="iii.vii.v-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.vii.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.—</span>*After the Death of
Tiberius, Caius appointed Agrippa King of the Jews, having punished
Herod with Perpetual Exile.*

<span id="iii.vii.v-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.vii.v-p2.1"></span>Tiberius</span> died, after having reigned
about twenty-two years, <span id="fr_291"></span>[292](#fn_291.md) and
Caius succeeded him in the empire. <span
id="fr_292"></span>[293](#fn_292.md) He immediately gave the government of
the Jews to Agrippa, <span id="fr_293"></span>[294](#fn_293.md) making him
king over the tetrarchies of Philip and of Lysanias; in addition to
which he bestowed upon him, not long afterward, the tetrarchy of
Herod, <span id="fr_294"></span>[295](#fn_294.md) having punished Herod
(the one under whom the Saviour suffered <span
id="fr_295"></span>[296](#fn_295) .md) and his wife Herodias with perpetual
exile <span id="fr_296"></span>[297](#fn_296.md) on account of numerous
crimes. Josephus is a witness to these facts. <span
id="fr_297"></span>[298](#fn_297.md)

<span id="iii.vii.v-p10"></span>2. Under this emperor, Philo <span
id="fr_298"></span>[299](#fn_298.md) became known; <span id="page_108">p.
108</span> <span id="iii.vii.v-Page_108"></span>a man most celebrated
not only among many of our own, but also among many scholars without the
Church. He was a Hebrew by birth, but was inferior to none of those who
held high dignities in Alexandria. How exceedingly he labored in the
Scriptures and in the studies of his nation is plain to all from the
work which he has done. How familiar he was with philosophy and with the
liberal studies of foreign nations, it is not necessary to say, since he
is reported to have surpassed all his contemporaries in the study of
Platonic and Pythagorean philosophy, to which he particularly devoted
his attention. <span id="fr_299"></span>[300](#fn_299.md)

<span id="iii.vii.v-p3"></span> From Aug. 29, <span class="c13"><span

<span id="iii.vii.v-p4"></span> Caius ruled from the death of Tiberius
until Jan. 24, <span class="c13"><span

<span id="iii.vii.v-p5"></span> Herod Agrippa I. He was a son of
Aristobulus, and a grandson of Herod the Great. He was educated in Rome
and gained high favor with Caius, and upon the latter’s accession to the
throne received the tetrarchies of Philip and Lysanias, and in <span
class="c13"><span id="iii.vii.v-p5.1"></span>a.d.</span> 39 the
tetrarchy of Galilee and Perea, which had belonged to Herod Antipas.
After the death of Caius, his successor, Claudius, appointed him also
king over the province of Judea and Samaria, which made him ruler of all
Palestine, a dominion as extensive as that of Herod the Great. He was a
strict observer of the Jewish law, and courted the favor of the Jews
with success. It was by him that James the Elder was beheaded, and Peter
imprisoned ([Acts xii.](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#000.md)<span
id="iii.vii.v-p5.2"></span>). He died of a terrible disease in <span
class="c13"><span id="iii.vii.v-p5.3"></span>a.d.</span> 44. See below,
chap. 10.

<span id="iii.vii.v-p8"></span> He was banished in <span

in Gaul (according to Josephus, *Ant.* XVIII. 7. 2; or to Spain,
according to his *B. J*. II. 9. 6), and died in Spain (according to *B.
J*. II. 9. 6).

<span id="iii.vii.v-p11"></span> Philo was an Alexandrian Jew of high
family, who was born probably about 20–10 <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.vii.v-p11.1"></span>b.c.</span> (in his *Legat. ad Cajum,* he
calls himself an old man). Very little is known about his life, and the
time of his death is uncertain. The only fixed date which we have is the
embassy to Caligula (<span class="c13"><span
id="iii.vii.v-p11.2"></span>a.d.</span> 40), and he lived for at least
some time after this. He is mentioned by Jerome (*de vir. ill.* 11), who
says he was born of a priestly family; but Eusebius knows nothing of
this, and there is probably no truth in the statement. He is mentioned
also by Josephus in his *Ant.* XVIII. 8. 1. He was a Jewish philosopher,
thoroughly imbued with the Greek spirit, who strove to unite Jewish
beliefs with Greek culture, and exerted immense influence upon the
thought of subsequent ages, especially upon Christian theology. His
works (Biblical, historical, philosophical, practical, &c.) are very
numerous, and probably the majority of them are still extant. For
particulars, see chap. 18, below. For an excellent account of Philo, see
Schürer, *Geschichte des Jüdischen Volkes im Zeitalter Jesu Christi;*
zweite Auflage, Bd. II. p. 831 to 884 (Leipzig, 1886), where the chief
literature upon the subject is given.

<span id="iii.vii.v-p12"></span> Philo was thoroughly acquainted with
Greek literature in all its departments, and shows great familiarity
with it in his works. The influence of Plato upon him was very great,
not only upon his philosophical system, but also upon his language; and
all the Greek philosophers were studied and honored by him. He may,
indeed, himself be called one of them. His system is eclectic, and
contains not only Platonic, but also Pythagorean, and even Stoic,
elements. Upon his doctrinal system, see especially Schürer, *ibid.* p.
836 sq.
