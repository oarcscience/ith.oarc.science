<span id="iv.iii.iii.iv-p1"></span> §4. *Laws*.

<span id="iv.iii.iii.iv-p2"></span>The numerous laws are collected in
the edition of Migne (*Patrol. Lat.* 8. p. 93–400), mainly from the
Theodosian code. They are in the opinion of Eutropius (10. 8) “many,”
“some good and equitable, but most of them superfluous, and some severe”
(cf. under *Character*). Many of them show the author’s tendency to
declamation, but taken all in all they are businesslike and do credit,
in the main, to their author’s heart, and even, though less
conspicuously, to his head. For more specific account, compare the laws
themselves as collected in Migne, the relating passages in Wordsworth
and Ceillier, standard and annotated editions of the codes, and special
treatises, such as Balduin, *De leg. eccl. et civ*. 1737.
