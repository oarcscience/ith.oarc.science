<span id="iv.vi.i.xxxiv-p3"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.xxxiv-p3.1"></span>Now</span> a certain woman, wife of one
of the senators who held the authority of prefect, when she understood
that those who ministered to the tyrant in such matters were standing
before her house (she was a Christian), and knew that her husband
through fear had bidden them take her and lead her away, begged a short
space of time for arraying herself in her usual dress, and entered her
chamber. There, being left alone, she sheathed a sword in her own
breast, and immediately expired, leaving indeed her dead body to the
procurers, but declaring to all mankind, both to present and future
generations, by an act which spoke louder than any words, that the
chastity for which Christians are famed is the only thing which is
invincible and indestructible. Such was the conduct displayed by this
woman.
