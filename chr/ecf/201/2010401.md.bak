<span id="iv.vi.i.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVI</span>.—*How Constantius,
feigning Idolatry, expelled those who consented to offer Sacrifice, but
retained in his Palace all who were willing to confess Christ.*

<span id="iv.vi.i.xvi-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.xvi-p2.1"></span>On</span> the other hand, Constantius
conceived an expedient full of sagacity, and did a thing which sounds
paradoxical, but in fact was most admirable.

<span id="iv.vi.i.xvi-p3"></span>He made a proposal to all the officers
of his court, including even those in the highest stations of authority,
offering them the following alternative: either that they should offer
sacrifice to demons, and thus be permitted to remain with him, and enjoy
their usual honors; or, in case of refusal, that they should be shut out
from all access to his person, and entirely disqualified from
acquaintance and association with him. Accordingly, when they had
individually made their choice, some one way and some the other; and the
choice of each had been ascertained, then this admirable prince
disclosed the secret meaning of his expedient, and condemned the
cowardice and selfishness of the one party, while he highly commended
the other for their conscientious devotion to God. He declared, too,
that those who had been false to their God must be unworthy of the
confidence of their prince; for how was it possible that they should
preserve their fidelity to him, who had proved themselves faithless to a
higher power? He determined, therefore, that such persons should be
removed altogether from the imperial court, while, on the other hand,
declaring that those men who, in bearing witness for the truth, had
proved them<span id="page_487">p. 487</span> <span
id="iv.vi.i.xvi-Page_487"></span>selves to be worthy servants of God,
would manifest the same fidelity to their king, he entrusted them with
the guardianship of his person and empire, saying that he was bound to
treat such persons with special regard as his nearest and most valued
friends, and to esteem them far more highly than the richest treasures.
