Christianity to the Inhabitants of Egypt.*

<span id="iii.vii.xvii-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span

first that was sent to Egypt, and that he proclaimed the Gospel which he
had written, and first established churches in Alexandria. <span

<span id="iii.vii.xvii-p4"></span>2. And the multitude of believers,
both men and women, that were collected there at the very outset, and
lived lives of the most philosophical and excessive asceticism, was so
great, that Philo thought it worth while to describe their pursuits,
their meetings, their entertainments, and their whole manner of
life.” <span id="fr_394"></span>[395](#fn_394.md)

<span id="iii.vii.xvii-p3"></span> That Mark labored in Egypt is stated
also by Epiphanius (*Hær.* LI. 6), by Jerome (*de vir. ill.* 8), by
Nicephorus (*H. E.* II. 43), and by the *Acta Barnabæ,* p. 26
(Tischendorf’s *Acta Apost. Apocr.* p. 74), which were written probably
in the third century. Eusebius gained his knowledge apparently from oral
tradition, for he uses the formula, “they say” (<span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.vii.xvii-p3.1"></span>φασὶν</span>). In
chap. 24, below, he says that Annianus succeeded Mark as a leader of the
Alexandrian Church in the eighth year of Nero (62 <span
class="c13"><span id="iii.vii.xvii-p3.2"></span>a.d.</span>), thus
implying that Mark died in that year; and Jerome gives the same date for
his death. But if the tradition that he wrote his Gospel in Rome under
Peter (or after Peter’s death, as the best tradition puts it, so e.g.
Irenæus) be correct, then this date is hopelessly wrong. The varying
traditions are at best very uncertain, and the whole career of Mark, so
far as it is not recorded in the New Testament, is involved in
obscurity.
