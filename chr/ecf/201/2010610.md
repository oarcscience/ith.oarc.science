himself to be a Bishop, in Charge of Affairs External to the Church.*

<span id="iv.vi.iv.xxiv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.xxiv-p2.1"></span>Hence</span> it was not without reason
that once, on the occasion of his entertaining a company of bishops, he
let fall the expression, “that he himself too was a bishop,” addressing
them in my hearing in the following words: “You are bishops whose
jurisdiction is within the Church: I also am a bishop, ordained by God
to overlook whatever is external to the Church.” <span

with his words: for he watched over his subjects with an episcopal care,
and exhorted them as far as in him lay to follow a godly life.
