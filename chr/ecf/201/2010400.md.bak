id="iv.vi.i.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XV</span>.—*Of the Persecution
raised by his Colleagues.*

<span id="iv.vi.i.xv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.xv-p2.1"></span>By</span> command of the supreme authorities
of the empire, the governors of the several provinces had set on foot a
general persecution of the godly. Indeed, it was from the imperial
courts themselves that the very first of the pious martyrs proceeded,
who passed through those conflicts for the faith, and most readily
endured both fire and sword, and the depths of the sea; every form of
death, in short, so that in a brief time all the royal palaces were
bereft of pious men. <span id="fr_3082"></span>[3083](#fn_3082.md) The
result was, that the authors of this wickedness were entirely deprived
of the protecting care of God, since by their persecution of his
worshipers they at the same time silenced the prayers that were wont to
be made on their own behalf.
