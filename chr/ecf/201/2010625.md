<span id="iv.vi.iv.xxxix-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.xxxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXIX</span>.—*That a Place in
Phœnicia also was made a City, and in Other Cities Idolatry was
abolished, and Churches built.*

<span id="iv.vi.iv.xxxix-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.xxxix-p2.1"></span>A similar</span> change was effected in
several other cities; for instance, in that town of Phœnicia which
received its name from that of the emperor, and the inhabitants of which
committed their innumerable idols to the flames, and adopted in their
stead the principles of the saving faith. Numbers, too, in the other
provinces, both in the cities and the country, became willing inquirers
after the saving knowledge of God; destroyed as worthless things the
images of every kind which they had heretofore held most sacred;
voluntarily demolished the lofty temples and shrines which contained
them; and, renouncing their former sentiments, or rather errors,
commenced and completed entirely new churches. But since it is not so
much my province to give a circumstantial detail of the actions of this
pious prince, as it is theirs who have been privileged to enjoy his
society at all times, I shall content myself with briefly recording such
facts as have come to my own personal knowledge, before I proceed to
notice the last days of his life.
