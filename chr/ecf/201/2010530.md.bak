Council, after Some Words by the Bishop Eusebius.*

<span id="iv.vi.iii.xi-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.xi-p2.1"></span>The</span> bishop who occupied the chief
place in the right division of the assembly <span
id="fr_3247"></span>[3248](#fn_3247.md) then rose, and, addressing the
emperor, delivered a concise speech, in a strain of thanksgiving to
Almighty God on his behalf. When he had resumed his seat, silence
ensued, and all regarded the emperor with fixed attention; on which he
looked serenely round on the assembly with a cheerful aspect, and,
having collected his thoughts, in a calm and gentle tone gave utterance
to the following words.
