<span id="iii.vii.xv-p1"></span> <span id="page_115">p. 115</span> <span
id="iii.vii.xv-Page_115"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.vii.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIV.—</span>*The Preaching of the
Apostle Peter in Rome.*

<span id="iii.vii.xv-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.vii.xv-p2.1"></span>The</span> evil power, <span
id="fr_377"></span>[378](#fn_377.md) who hates all that is good and plots
against the salvation of men, constituted Simon at that time the father
and author of such wickedness, <span id="fr_378"></span>[379](#fn_378.md)
as if to make him a mighty antagonist of the great, inspired apostles of
our Saviour.

<span id="iii.vii.xv-p5"></span>2. For that divine and celestial grace
which co-operates with its ministers, by their appearance and presence,
quickly extinguished the kindled flame of evil, and humbled and cast
down through them “every high thing that exalted itself against the
knowledge of God.” <span id="fr_379"></span>[380](#fn_379.md)

<span id="iii.vii.xv-p7"></span>3. Wherefore neither the conspiracy of
Simon nor that of any of the others who arose at that period could
accomplish anything in those apostolic times. For everything was
conquered and subdued by the splendors of the truth and by the divine
word itself which had but lately begun to shine from heaven upon men,
and which was then flourishing upon earth, and dwelling in the apostles
themselves.

<span id="iii.vii.xv-p8"></span>4. Immediately <span
id="fr_380"></span>[381](#fn_380.md) the above-mentioned impostor was
smitten in the eyes of his mind by a divine and miraculous flash, and
after the evil deeds done by him had been first detected by the apostle
Peter in Judea, <span id="fr_381"></span>[382](#fn_381.md) he fled and made
a great journey across the sea from the East to the West, thinking that
only thus could he live according to his mind.

<span id="iii.vii.xv-p11"></span>5. And coming to the city of
Rome, <span id="fr_382"></span>[383](#fn_382.md) by the mighty co-operation
of that power which was lying in wait there, he was in a short time so
successful in his undertaking that those who dwelt there honored him as
a god by the erection of a statue. <span
id="fr_383"></span>[384](#fn_383.md)

<span id="iii.vii.xv-p14"></span>6. But this did not last long. For
immediately, during the reign of Claudius, the all-good and gracious
Providence, which watches over all things, led Peter, that strongest and
greatest of the apostles, and the one who on account of his virtue was
the speaker for all the others, to Rome <span
id="fr_384"></span>[385](#fn_384.md) against this great corrupter of life.
He like a noble commander of God, clad in divine armor, carried the
costly merchandise of the light of the understanding from the East to
those who dwelt in the West, proclaiming the light itself, and the word
which brings salvation to souls, and preaching the kingdom of
heaven. <span id="fr_385"></span>[386](#fn_385.md)

<span id="iii.vii.xv-p9"></span> The significance of the word
“immediately” as employed here is somewhat dark. There is no event
described in the preceding context with which it can be connected. I am
tempted to think that Eusebius may have been using at this point some
unknown source and that the word “immediately” refers to an encounter
which Simon had had with Peter (perhaps his Cæsarean discussion,
mentioned in the Clementines), of which an account was given in the
document employed by Eusebius. The figure employed here is most
remarkable.

sqq. This occurred in Samaria, not in Judea proper, but Eusebius
evidently uses the word “Judea” in a wide sense, to indicate the Roman
province of Judea, which included also Samaria. It is not impossible,
especially if Eusebius is quoting here from a written source, that some
other encounter of Simon and Peter is referred to. Such a one e.g. as is
mentioned in the *Apostolic Constitutions,* VI. 8.

<span id="fn_382"></span>[115:383](2010056.htm#fr_382.md) <span
id="iii.vii.xv-p11.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vii.xv-p12"></span> Rome was a great gathering place of
heretics and schismatics. They were all attracted thither by the
opportunities for propagandism which the city afforded, and therefore
Eusebius, with his transcendental conception of heresy, naturally makes
it the especial seat of the devil.

id="iii.vii.xv-p14.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vii.xv-p15"></span> Upon the historic truth of Peter’s
visit to Rome, see below, chap. 25, note 7. Although we may accept it as
certain that he did visit Rome, and that he met his death there, it is
no less certain that he did not reach there until late in the reign of
Nero. The tradition that he was for twenty-five years bishop of Rome is
first recorded by Jerome (*de vir. ill.* c. 1), and since his time has
been almost universally accepted in the Roman Catholic Church, though in
recent years many more candid scholars of that communion acknowledge
that so long an episcopate there is a fiction. The tradition undoubtedly
took its rise from the statement of Justin Martyr (quoted in the
previous chapter) that Simon Magus came to Rome during the reign of
Claudius. Tradition, in the time of Eusebius, commonly connected the
Roman visits of Simon and of Peter; and consequently Eusebius, accepting
the earlier date for Simon’s arrival in Rome, quite naturally assumed
also the same date for Peter’s arrival there, although Justin does not
mention Peter in connection with Simon in the passage which Eusebius
quotes. The assumption that Peter took up his residence in Rome during
the reign of Claudius contradicts all that we know of Peter’s later life
from the New Testament and from other early writers. In 44 <span
class="c13"><span id="iii.vii.xv-p15.1"></span>a.d.</span> he was in
Jerusalem (according to <span id="iii.vii.xv-p15.2"></span>[Acts xii.
3](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#003)<span id="iii.vii.xv-p15.3"></span>.md);
in 51 he was again there (according to [Acts
xv](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#000.md)<span
id="iii.vii.xv-p15.4"></span>.); and a little later in Antioch
(according to [Gal. i. 11](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#011.md)<span
id="iii.vii.xv-p15.5"></span> sq.). Moreover, at some time during his
life he labored in various provinces in Asia Minor, as we learn from his
first epistle, and probably wrote that epistle from Babylon on the
Euphrates (see chap. 15, note 7). At any rate, he cannot have been in
Rome when Paul wrote his epistle to the Romans (57 or 58 <span
class="c13"><span id="iii.vii.xv-p15.6"></span>a.d.</span>), for no
mention is made of him among the brethren to whom greetings are sent.
Nor can he have been there when Paul wrote from Rome during his
captivity (61 or 62 to 63 or 64 <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.vii.xv-p15.7"></span>a.d.</span>). We have, in fact, no trace of
him in Rome, except the extra-Biblical but well-founded tradition (see
chap. 25, note 7) that he met his death there. We may assume, then, that
he did not reach Rome at any rate until shortly before his death; that
is, shortly before the summer of 64 <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.vii.xv-p15.8"></span>a.d.</span> As most of the accounts put
Simon Magus’ visit to Rome in the reign of Nero (see above, chap. 13,
note 9), so they make him follow Peter thither (as he had followed him
everywhere, opposing and attacking him), instead of precede him, as
Eusebius does. Eusebius follows Justin in giving the earlier date for
Simon’s visit to Rome; but he goes beyond Justin in recording his
encounter there with Peter, which neither Justin nor Irenæus mentions.
The earlier date for Simon’s visit is undoubtedly that given by the
oldest tradition. Afterward, when Peter and Paul were so prominently
connected with the reign of Nero, the visit of Simon was postponed to
synchronize with the presence of the two apostles in Rome. A report of
Simon’s meeting with Peter in Rome is given first by Hippolytus (VI.
15); afterward by Arnobius (II. 12), who does not describe the meeting;
by the *Ap. Const.,* the Clementine *Recognitions* and *Homilies,* and
the *Acts of the Apostles Peter and Paul.* It is impossible to tell from
what source Eusebius drew his information. Neither Justin, Irenæus, nor
Tertullian mentions it. Hippolytus and Arnobius and the *App. Const.*
give too much, as they give accounts of his death, which Eusebius does
not follow. As to this, it might, however, be said that these accounts
are so conflicting that Eusebius may have omitted them entirely, while
yet recording the meeting. Still, if he had read Hippolytus, he could
hardly have omitted entirely his interesting account. Arnobius and
Tertullian, who wrote in Latin, he did not read, and the Clementines
were probably too late for him; at any rate, they cannot have been the
source of his account, which differs entirely from theirs. It is highly
probable, therefore, that he followed Justin and Irenæus as far as they
go, and that he recorded the meeting with Peter in Rome as a fact
commonly accepted in his time, and one for which he needed no written
authority; or it is possible that he had another source, unknown to us,
as suggested above (note 4).

This sentence furnishes an excellent illustration of Eusebius’
rhetorical style.
