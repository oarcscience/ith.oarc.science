outrages; being stretched on the rack and lacerated in their sides, that
it might be ascertained through various tortures, whether they came from
the enemy; and finally being subjected to punishment by the cross or by
fire.

and breastplates were preparing, and darts and spears and other warlike
accoutrements were making ready, and galleys and naval armor were
collecting in every place. And no one expected anything else than to be
attacked by enemies any day. In addition to this, famine and pestilence
came upon them, in regard to which we shall relate what is necessary in
the proper place. <span id="fr_2585"></span>[2586](#fn_2585.md)

<span id="iii.xiii.xvi-p4"></span> Diocletian’s First Edict was issued
on Feb. 24, 303; and the persecution was brought to a final end by
Constantine and Licinius’ edict of toleration, which was issued at Milan
late in the year 312 (see below, Bk. IX. chap. 9, note 17). The
persecution may therefore be said to have lasted altogether ten years;
although of course there were many cessations during that period, and in
the West it really came to an end with the usurpation of Maxentius in
306, and in the East (except in Maximin’s dominions) with the edict of
Galerius in 311.

<span id="iii.xiii.xvi-p5"></span> This passage is largely rhetorical.
It is true that enough plotting and warring went on after the usurpation
of Maxentius in 306, and after the death of Galerius in 311, to justify
pretty strong statements. Gibbon, for instance, says: “The abdication of
Diocletian and Maximian was succeeded by eighteen years of discord and
confusion. The empire was afflicted by five civil wars; and the
remainder of the time was not so much a state of tranquillity as a
suspension of arms between several hostile monarchs, who, viewing each
other with an eye of fear and hatred, strove to increase their
respective forces at the expense of their subjects” (chap. xiv.). At the
same time, during the four years between 307 and 311, though there was
not the harmony which had existed under Diocletian, and though the
interests of the West and East were in the main hostile, yet the empire
was practically at peace, barring the persecution of the Christians.
