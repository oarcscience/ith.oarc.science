id="iv.vi.iii.xxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVII</span>.—*How Constantine
commanded the Materials of the Idol Temple, and the Soil itself, to be
removed at a Distance.*

<span id="iv.vi.iii.xxvii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.xxvii-p2.1"></span>Nor</span> did the emperor’s zeal stop
here; but he gave further orders that the materials of what was thus
destroyed, both stone and timber, should be removed and thrown as far
from the spot as possible; and this command also was speedily executed.
The emperor, however, was not satisfied with having proceeded thus far:
once more, fired with holy ardor, he directed that the ground itself
should be dug up to a considerable depth, and the soil which had been
polluted by the foul impurities of demon worship transported to a far
distant place.
