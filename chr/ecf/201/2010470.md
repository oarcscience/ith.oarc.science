Ancient Times.*

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xxv-p2"></span>“<span class="c13"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.xxv-p2.1"></span>For</span> certainly any one who will
mentally retrace the course of events from the earliest period down to
the present time, and will reflect on what has occurred in past ages,
will find that all who have made justice and probity the basis of their
conduct, have not only carried their undertakings to a successful issue,
but have gathered, as it were, a store of sweet fruit as the produce of
this pleasant root. Again, whoever observes the career of those who have
been bold in the practice of oppression or injustice; who have either
directed their senseless fury against God himself, or have conceived no
kindly feelings towards their fellow-men, but have dared to afflict them
with exile, disgrace, confiscation, massacre, or other miseries of the
like kind, and all this without any sense of compunction, or wish to
direct thoughts to a better course, will find that such men have
received a recompense proportioned to their crimes. And these are
results which might naturally and reasonably be expected to ensue. <span

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xxv-p3"></span> There is a curious unanimity of
effort on the part of theological amateurs, ancient and modern, to prove
that those upon whom the tower in Siloam fell were guiltier than others.
This was the spirit of Lactantius and it is not to be wondered at that
Constantine should adopt such a peculiarly self-satisfying doctrine.
