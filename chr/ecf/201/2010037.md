<span id="iii.vi.x-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.vi.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter X.—</span>*The High Priests of the
Jews under whom Christ taught.*

<span id="iii.vi.x-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.vi.x-p2.1"></span>It</span> was in the fifteenth year of the
reign of Tiberius, <span id="fr_171"></span>[172](#fn_171) according to
the evangelist, and in the fourth year of the governorship of Pontius
Pilate, <span id="fr_172"></span>[173](#fn_172) while Herod and Lysanias
and Philip were ruling the rest of Judea, <span
id="fr_173"></span>[174](#fn_173) that our Saviour and Lord, Jesus the
Christ of God, being about thirty years of age, <span
id="fr_174"></span>[175](#fn_174) came to John for baptism and began the
promulgation of the Gospel.

<span id="iii.vi.x-p7"></span>2. The Divine Scripture says, moreover,
that he passed the entire time of his ministry under the high priests
Annas and Caiaphas, <span id="fr_175"></span>[176](#fn_175) showing that
in the time which be<span id="page_97">p. 97</span> <span
id="iii.vi.x-Page_97"></span>longed to the priesthood of those two men
the whole period of his teaching was completed. Since he began his work
during the high priesthood of Annas and taught until Caiaphas held the
office, the entire time does not comprise quite four years.

<span id="iii.vi.x-p11"></span>3. For the rites of the law having been
already abolished since that time, the customary usages in connection
with the worship of God, according to which the high priest acquired his
office by hereditary descent and held it for life, were also annulled
and there were appointed to the high priesthood by the Roman governors
now one and now another person who continued in office not more than one
year. <span id="fr_176"></span>[177](#fn_176)

<span id="iii.vi.x-p13"></span>4. Josephus relates that there were four
high priests in succession from Annas to Caiaphas. Thus in the same book
of the Antiquities <span id="fr_177"></span>[178](#fn_177) he writes as
follows: “Valerius Gratus <span id="fr_178"></span>[179](#fn_178) having
put an end to the priesthood of Ananus <span
id="fr_179"></span>[180](#fn_179) appoints Ishmael, <span
id="fr_180"></span>[181](#fn_180) the son of Fabi, high priest. And
having removed him after a little he appoints Eleazer, <span
id="fr_181"></span>[182](#fn_181) the son of Ananus the high priest, to
the same office. And having removed him also at the end of a year he
gives the high priesthood to Simon, <span
id="fr_182"></span>[183](#fn_182) the son of Camithus. But he likewise
held the honor no more than a year, when Josephus, called also
Caiaphas, <span id="fr_183"></span>[184](#fn_183) succeeded him.”
Accordingly the whole time of our Saviour’s ministry is shown to have
been not quite four full years, four high priests, from Annas to the
accession of Caiaphas, having held office a year each. The Gospel
therefore has rightly indicated Caiaphas as the high priest under whom
the Saviour suffered. From which also we can see that the time of our
Saviour’s ministry does not disagree with the foregoing investigation.

<span id="iii.vi.x-p21"></span>5. Our Saviour and Lord, not long after
the beginning of his ministry, called the twelve apostles, <span
id="fr_184"></span>[185](#fn_184) and these alone of all his disciples
he named apostles, as an especial honor. And again he appointed seventy
others whom he sent out two by two before his face into every place and
city whither he himself was about to come. <span

<span id="iii.vi.x-p3"></span> [Luke iii.
1](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#001)<span id="iii.vi.x-p3.1"></span>.
Eusebius reckons the fifteenth year of Tiberius from 14 <span
class="c13"><span id="iii.vi.x-p3.2"></span>a.d.</span>, that is, from
the time when he became sole emperor. There is a difference of opinion
among commentators as to whether Luke began to reckon from the
colleagueship of Tiberius (11 or 12 <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.vi.x-p3.3"></span>a.d.</span>), or from the beginning of his
reign as sole emperor. Either mode of reckoning is allowable, but as
Luke says that Christ “began to be about thirty years of age” at this
time, and as he was born probably about 4 <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.vi.x-p3.4"></span>b.c.</span>, the former seems to have been
Luke’s mode. Compare Andrew’s *Life of our Lord,* p. 28.

<span id="fn_172"></span>[96:173](2010037.htm#fr_172) <span
id="iii.vi.x-p3.5"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.x-p4"></span> Luke says simply, “while Pontius Pilate
was governor of Judea,” and does not mention the year, as Eusebius does.

<span id="fn_173"></span>[96:174](2010037.htm#fr_173) <span
id="iii.vi.x-p4.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.x-p5"></span> See the previous chapter.

<span id="fn_174"></span>[96:175](2010037.htm#fr_174) <span
id="iii.vi.x-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.x-p6"></span> Eusebius’ reckoning would make Christ’s
birthday synchronize with the beginning of our Christian era, which is
at least three years out of the way.

<span id="fn_175"></span>[96:176](2010037.htm#fr_175) <span
id="iii.vi.x-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.x-p8"></span> [Luke
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#002), [John
11:49](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#049),
[51](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#051), [John
18:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#013)<span
id="iii.vi.x-p8.1"></span>[Luke iii.
2](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#002)<span id="iii.vi.x-p8.2"></span>
compared with [John xi. 49](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#049)<span
id="iii.vi.x-p8.3"></span> and 51, and xviii. 13.

<span id="iii.vi.x-p9"></span>Stroth remarks: “Had I not feared acting
contrary to the duty of a translator, I should gladly, for the sake of
Eusebius’ honor, have left out this entire chapter, which is full of
historical inaccuracies and contradictions. Eusebius deduces from
Josephus himself that the Procurator Gratus, whom Pilate succeeded,
appointed Caiaphas high priest. Therefore Caiaphas became high priest
before the twelfth year of Tiberius, for in that year Pilate became
procurator. In the fifteenth year of Tiberius, Christ began his work
when Caiaphas had already been high priest three years and according to
the false account of our author he became high priest for the first time
in the nineteenth year of Tiberius. The whole structure of this chapter,
therefore, falls to the ground. It is almost inconceivable how so
prudent a man could have committed so great a mistake of the same sort
as that which he had denounced a little before in connection with the
*Acts of Pilate*.”

<span id="iii.vi.x-p10"></span>The whole confusion is due to Eusebius’
mistaken interpretation of the Gospel account, which he gives in this
sentence. It is now universally assumed that Annas is named by the
evangelists as ex-high-priest, but Eusebius, not understanding this,
supposed that a part of Christ’s ministry must have fallen during the
active administration of Annas, a part during that of Caiaphas, and
therefore his ministry must have run from the one to the other,
embracing the intermediate administrations of Ishmael, Eleazer, and
Simon, and covering less than four years. In order to make this out he
interprets the “not long after” in connection with Ishmael as meaning
“one year,” which is incorrect, as shown below in note 9. How Eusebius
could have overlooked the plain fact that all this occurred under
Valerius Gratus instead of Pilate, and therefore many years too early
(when he himself states the fact), is almost incomprehensible. Absorbed
in making out his interpretation, he must have thoughtlessly confounded
the names of Gratus and Pilate while reading the account. He cannot have
acted knowingly, with the intention to deceive, for he must have seen
that anybody reading his account would discover the glaring discrepancy
at once.

<span id="fn_176"></span>[97:177](2010037.htm#fr_176) <span
id="iii.vi.x-p11.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.x-p12"></span> It is true that under the Roman
governors the high priests were frequently changed (cf. above, chap. 6,
note 19), but there was no regularly prescribed interval, and some
continued in office for many years; for instance, Caiaphas was high
priest for more than ten years, during the whole of Pilate’s
administration, having been appointed by Valerius Gratus, Pilate’s
predecessor, and his successor being appointed by the Proconsul
Vitellius in 37 <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.vi.x-p12.1"></span>a.d.</span> (*vid.* Josephus, *Ant.* XVIII.
2. 2 and 4. 3).

<span id="fn_177"></span>[97:178](2010037.htm#fr_177) <span
id="iii.vi.x-p13.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.x-p14"></span> Josephus, *Ant.* XVIII. 2.2.

<span id="fn_178"></span>[97:179](2010037.htm#fr_178) <span
id="iii.vi.x-p14.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.x-p15"></span> This Valerius Gratus was made procurator
by Tiberius, soon after his accession, and ruled about eleven years,
when he was succeeded by Pilate in 26 <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.vi.x-p15.1"></span>a.d.</span>

<span id="fn_179"></span>[97:180](2010037.htm#fr_179) <span
id="iii.vi.x-p15.2"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.x-p16"></span> Ananus (or Annas) was appointed high
priest by Quirinius, governor of Syria, in 6 or 7 <span
class="c13"><span id="iii.vi.x-p16.1"></span>a.d.</span> (Josephus,
*Ant.* XVIII. 2. 1), and remained in office until <span
class="c13"><span id="iii.vi.x-p16.2"></span>a.d.</span> 14 or 15, when
he was deposed by Valerius Gratus (*ib.* §2). This forms another
instance, therefore, of a term of office more than one year in length.
Annas is a familiar personage from his connection with the Gospel
history; but the exact position which he occupied during Christ’s
ministry is difficult to determine (cf. Wieseler’s *Chronology of the
Life of Christ*).

<span id="fn_180"></span>[97:181](2010037.htm#fr_180) <span
id="iii.vi.x-p16.3"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.x-p17"></span> Either this Ishmael must have held the
office eight or ten years, or else Caiaphas that long before Pilate’s
time, for otherwise Gratus’ period is not filled up. Josephus’ statement
is indefinite in regard to Ishmael, and Eusebius is wrong in confining
his term of office to one year.

<span id="fn_181"></span>[97:182](2010037.htm#fr_181) <span
id="iii.vi.x-p17.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.x-p18"></span> According to Josephus, *Ant.* XX. 9. 1,
five of the sons of Annas became high priests.

<span id="fn_182"></span>[97:183](2010037.htm#fr_182) <span
id="iii.vi.x-p18.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.x-p19"></span> This Simon is an otherwise unknown
personage.

<span id="fn_183"></span>[97:184](2010037.htm#fr_183) <span
id="iii.vi.x-p19.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.x-p20"></span> Joseph Caiaphas, son-in-law of Annas, is
well known from his connection with the Gospel history.
