<span id="iv.vi.i.xxxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.xxxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXVIII</span>.—*Death of
Maxentius on the Bridge of the Tiber.* <span
id="fr_3125"></span>[3126](#fn_3125)

<span id="iv.vi.i.xxxviii-p3"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.xxxviii-p3.1"></span>And</span> already he was approaching
very near Rome itself, when, to save him from the necessity of fighting
with all the Romans for the tyrant’s sake, God himself drew the tyrant,
as it were by secret cords, a long way outside the gates. <span
id="fr_3126"></span>[3127](#fn_3126) And now those miracles recorded in
<span id="page_493">p. 493</span> <span
id="iv.vi.i.xxxviii-Page_493"></span>Holy Writ, which God of old wrought
against the ungodly (discredited by most as fables, yet believed by the
faithful), did he in every deed confirm to all alike, believers and
unbelievers, who were eye-witnesses of the wonders. For as once in the
days of Moses and the Hebrew nation, who were worshipers of God,
“Pharaoh’s chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea and his
chosen chariot-captains are drowned in the Red Sea,” <span
id="fr_3127"></span>[3128](#fn_3127) —so at this time Maxentius, and the
soldiers and guards <span id="fr_3128"></span>[3129](#fn_3128) with him,
“went down into the depths like stone,” <span
id="fr_3129"></span>[3130](#fn_3129) when, in his flight before the
divinely-aided forces of Constantine, he essayed to cross the river
which lay in his way, over which, making a strong bridge of boats, he
had framed an engine of destruction, really against himself, but in the
hope of ensnaring thereby him who was beloved by God. For his God stood
by the one to protect him, while the other, godless, <span
id="fr_3130"></span>[3131](#fn_3130) proved to be the miserable
contriver of these secret devices to his own ruin. So that one might
well say, “He hath made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the
ditch which he made. His mischief shall return upon his own head, and
his violence shall come down upon his own pate.” <span
id="fr_3131"></span>[3132](#fn_3131) Thus, in the present instance,
under divine direction, the machine erected on the bridge, with the
ambuscade concealed therein, giving way unexpectedly before the
appointed time, the bridge began to sink, and the boats with the men in
them went bodily to the bottom. <span
id="fr_3132"></span>[3133](#fn_3132) And first the wretch himself, then
his armed attendants and guards, even as the sacred oracles had before
described, “sank as lead in the mighty waters.” <span
id="fr_3133"></span>[3134](#fn_3133) So that they who thus obtained
victory from God might well, if not in the same words, yet in fact in
the same spirit as the people of his great servant Moses, sing and speak
as they did concerning the impious tyrant of old: “Let us sing unto the
Lord, for he hath been glorified exceedingly: the horse and his rider
hath he thrown into the sea. He is become my helper and my shield unto
salvation.” And again, “Who is like unto thee, O Lord, among the gods?
who is like thee, glorious in holiness, marvelous in praises, doing
wonders?” <span id="fr_3134"></span>[3135](#fn_3134)

<span id="iv.vi.i.xxxviii-p4"></span> The present Ponte Molle is nearly
2½ kilometers (say 1½ miles) from the Porta del Popolo (at the Mons
Pincius). The walls at that time were the ones built by Aurelian, and
are substantially the same as the present ones. This Pons Milvius was
first built 100 years <span class="c13"><span
id="iv.vi.i.xxxviii-p4.1"></span>b.c.</span>, and “some part of the
first bridge is supposed to remain” (Jenkin, p. 329). Compare Jenkin,
art. *Bridges,* in *Enc. Brit.* 4 (1878), 329, for cut and description.

Septuagint with the change of only one word, where Eusebius gains little
in exchanging “swallowed up in” for plunged or drowned in.
