<span id="ii-p3"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii-p3.1"></span>The</span> First Series of the Nicene and
Post-Nicene Library of the Christian Fathers, containing, in fourteen
volumes, the principal works of St. Augustin and St. Chrysostom, has
been completed in less than four years, according to the Prospectus of
the Publisher issued in 1886.

<span id="ii-p4"></span>I am happy to state that the Second Series,
containing the chief works of the Fathers from Eusebius to John of
Damascus, and from Ambrose to Gregory the Great, will be issued on the
same liberal terms, as announced by the Publisher.

<span id="ii-p5"></span>The present volume opens the Second Series with
a new translation and critical commentary of the historical works of
Eusebius, by my friends, Dr. Arthur C. McGiffert and Dr. Ernest C.
Richardson, who have bestowed a vast amount of labor of love on their
tasks for several years past. I desired them to make these works a
reliable and tolerably complete Church History of the first three
centuries for the English reader. I think they have succeeded. Every
scholar will at once see the great value and superiority of this over
every other previous edition of Eusebius.

<span id="ii-p6"></span>The next two volumes will contain the Church
Histories of Socrates, Sozomen, Theodoret, and Evagrius. For further
details the reader is referred to the Publisher’s announcement at the
end of this volume.
