<span id="iii.x.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.x.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter III.—</span>*The Vision which appeared
in a Dream to the Witness Attalus.*

<span id="iii.x.iv-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.x.iv-p2.1"></span>The</span> same letter of the above-mentioned
witnesses contains another account worthy of remembrance. No one will
object to our bringing it to the knowledge of our readers.

<span id="iii.x.iv-p3"></span>2. It runs as follows: “For a certain
Alcibiades, <span id="fr_1405"></span>[1406](#fn_1405.md) who was one of
them, led a very austere life, partaking of nothing whatever but bread
and water. When he endeavored to continue this same sort of life in
prison, it was revealed to Attalus after his first conflict in the
amphitheater that Alcibiades was not doing well in refusing the
creatures of God and placing a stumbling-block before others.

<span id="iii.x.iv-p5"></span>3. And Alcibiades obeyed, and partook of
all things without restraint, giving thanks to God. For they were not
deprived of the grace of God, but the Holy Ghost was their counselor.”
Let this suffice for these matters.

<span id="iii.x.iv-p6"></span>4. The followers of Montanus, <span
id="fr_1406"></span>[1407](#fn_1406.md) Alcibiades <span
id="fr_1407"></span>[1408](#fn_1407.md) and Theodotus <span
id="fr_1408"></span>[1409](#fn_1408.md) in Phrygia were now first giving
wide circulation to their assumption in regard to prophecy,—for the many
other miracles <span id="page_219">p. 219</span> <span
id="iii.x.iv-Page_219"></span>that, through the gift of God, were still
wrought in the different churches caused their prophesying to be readily
credited by many,—and as dissension arose concerning them, the brethren
in Gaul set forth their own prudent and most orthodox judgment in the
matter, and published also several epistles from the witnesses that had
been put to death among them. These they sent, while they were still in
prison, to the brethren throughout Asia and Phrygia, and also to
Eleutherus, <span id="fr_1409"></span>[1410](#fn_1409.md) who was then
bishop of Rome, negotiating for the peace of the churches. <span
id="fr_1410"></span>[1411](#fn_1410.md)

id="iii.x.iv-p3.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.iv-p4"></span> Of this Alcibiades we know only what is
told us in this connection. Doubtless Eusebius found this extract very
much to his taste, for we know that he was not inclined to asceticism.
The enthusiastic spirit of the Lyons Christians comes out strongly in
the extract, and considerable light is thrown by it upon the state of
the Church there. Imprisoned confessors were never permitted to suffer
for want of food and the other comforts of life so long as their
brethren were allowed access to them. Compare e.g. Lucian’s *Peregrinus
Proteus.*

id="iii.x.iv-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.iv-p8"></span> Of this Montanist Alcibiades we know
nothing. He is, of course, to be distinguished from the confessor
mentioned just above. The majority of the editors of Eusebius substitute
his name for that of Miltiades in chap. 16, below, but the <span
class="c13"><span id="iii.x.iv-p8.1"></span>mss.</span> all read <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.x.iv-p8.2"></span>Μιλτι€δην</span>, and the
emendation is unwarranted (see chap. 16, note 7). Salmon suggests that
we should read Miltiades instead of Alcibiades in the present passage,
supposing that the latter may have crept in through a copyist’s error,
under the influence of the name Alcibiades mentioned just above. Such an
error is possible, but not probable (see chap. 16, note 7).

<span id="iii.x.iv-p9"></span> Of the Montanist Theodotus we know only
what is told us here and in chap. 16, below (see that chapter, note 25).

<span id="fn_1410"></span>[219:1411](2010144.htm#fr_1410.md) <span
id="iii.x.iv-p10.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.iv-p11"></span> It is commonly assumed that the Gallic
martyrs favored the Montanists and exhorted Eleutherus to be mild in his
judgment of them, and to preserve the peace of the Church by permitting
them to remain within it and enjoy fellowship with other Christians. But
Salmon (in the *Dict. of Christian Biog.* III. p. 937) has shown, in my
opinion conclusively, that the Gallic confessors took the opposite side,
and exhorted Eleutherus to confirm the Eastern Church in its
condemnation of the Montanists, representing to him that he would
threaten the peace of the Church by refusing to recognize the justice of
the decision of the bishops of the East and by setting himself in
opposition to them. Certainly, with their close connection with Asia
Minor, we should expect the Gallic Christians to be early informed of
the state of affairs in the East, and it is not difficult to think that
they may have formed the same opinion in regard to the new prophecy
which the majority of their brethren there had formed. The decisive
argument for Salmon’s opinion is the fact that Eusebius calls the letter
of the Lyons confessors to Eleutherus “pious and most orthodox.”
Certainly, looking upon Montanism as one of the most execrable of
heresies and as the work of Satan himself (cf. his words in chap. 16,
below), it is very difficult to suppose that he can have spoken of a
letter written expressly in favor of the Montanists in any such terms of
respect. Salmon says: “It is monstrous to imagine that Eusebius,
thinking thus of Montanism, could praise as pious or orthodox the
opinion of men who, ignorant of Satan’s devices, should take the devil’s
work for God’s. The way in which we ourselves read the history is that
*the Montanists had appealed to Rome*; that the Church party solicited
the good offices of their countrymen settled in Gaul, who wrote to
Eleutherus representing the disturbance to the peace of the churches (a
phrase probably preserved by Eusebius from the letter itself) which
would ensue if the Roman Church should approve what the Church on the
spot had condemned.…To avert, then, the possibility of the calamity of a
breach between the Eastern and Western churches, the Gallic churches, it
would appear, not only wrote, but sent Irenæus to Rome at the end of 177
or the beginning of 178. The hypothesis here made relieves us from the
necessity of supposing this <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.x.iv-p11.1"></span>πρεσβεία</span> to have been unsuccessful,
while it fully accounts for the necessity of sending it.”
