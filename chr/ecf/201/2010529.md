<span id="iv.vi.iii.x-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter X</span>.—*Council in the Palace.
Constantine, entering, took his Seat in the Assembly.*

<span id="iv.vi.iii.x-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.x-p2.1"></span>Now</span> when the appointed day arrived
on which the council met for the final solution of the questions in
dispute, each member was present for this in the central building of the
palace, <span id="fr_3245"></span>[3246](#fn_3245.md) which appeared to
exceed the rest in magnitude. On each side of the interior of this were
many seats disposed in order, which were occupied by those who had been
invited to attend, according to their rank. As soon, then, as the whole
assembly had seated themselves with becoming orderliness, a general
silence prevailed, in expectation of the emperor’s arrival. And first of
all, three of his immediate family entered in succession, then others
also preceded his approach, not of the soldiers or guards who usually
accompanied him, but only friends in the faith. And now, all rising at
the signal which indicated the emperor’s entrance, at last he himself
proceeded through the midst of the assembly, like some heavenly
messenger of God, clothed in raiment which glittered as it were with
rays of light, reflecting the glowing radiance of a purple robe, and
adorned with the brilliant splendor of gold and precious stones. Such
was the external appearance of his person; and with regard to his mind,
it was evident that he was distinguished by piety and godly fear. This
was indicated by his downcast eyes, the blush on his countenance, and
his gait. For the rest of his personal excellencies, he surpassed all
present in height of stature and beauty of form, as well as in majestic
dignity of mien, and invincible strength and vigor. All these graces,
united to a suavity of manner, and a serenity becoming his imperial
station, declared the excellence of his mental qualities to be above all
praise. <span id="fr_3246"></span>[3247](#fn_3246.md) As soon as he had
advanced to the upper end of the seats, at first he remained standing,
and when a low chair of wrought gold had been set for him, he waited
until the bishops had beckoned to him, and then sat down, and after him
the whole assembly did the same.

was the last day of the Council; the entire session of which occupied
more than two months, and which was originally held in a
church.—*Bag.*\] The exact dates of the Council are controverted, but it
seems that it ended August 25, having probably begun June 14.
