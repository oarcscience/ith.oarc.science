<span id="iii.x.xxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.x.xxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXV.—</span>*How All came to an
Agreement respecting the Passover.*

<span id="iii.x.xxvi-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.x.xxvi-p2.1"></span>Those</span> in Palestine whom we have
recently mentioned, Narcissus and Theophilus, <span
id="fr_1716"></span>[1717](#fn_1716.md) and with them Cassius, <span
id="fr_1717"></span>[1718](#fn_1717.md) bishop of the church of Tyre, and
Clarus of the church of Ptolemais, and those who met with them, <span
id="fr_1718"></span>[1719](#fn_1718.md) having stated many things
respecting the tradition concerning the passover which had come to them
in succession from the apostles, at the close of their writing add these
words: <span id="fr_1719"></span>[1720](#fn_1719.md)

<span id="iii.x.xxvi-p7"></span>2. “Endeavor to send copies of our
letter to every church, that we may not furnish occasion to those who
easily deceive their souls. We show you indeed that also in Alexandria
they keep it on the same day that we do. For letters are carried from us
to them and from them to us, so that in the same manner and at the same
time we keep the sacred day.” <span id="fr_1720"></span>[1721](#fn_1720.md)
