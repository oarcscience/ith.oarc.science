and incidentally, how he subjected barbarous nations to the Roman power;
how he was the first who <span id="page_542">p. 542</span> <span

never learned submission, and compelled them, how unwilling soever, to
own the sovereignty of Rome? For the emperors who preceded him had
actually rendered tribute to the Scythians: and Romans, by an annual
payment, had confessed themselves servants to barbarians; an indignity
which our emperor could no longer bear, nor think it consistent with his
victorious career to continue the payment his predecessors had made.
Accordingly, with full confidence in his Saviour’s aid, he raised his
conquering standard against these enemies also, and soon reduced them
all to obedience; coercing by military force those who fiercely resisted
his authority, while, on the other hand, he conciliated the rest by
wisely conducted embassies, and reclaimed them to a state of order and
civilization from their lawless and savage life. Thus the Scythians at
length learned to acknowledge subjection to the power of Rome.
