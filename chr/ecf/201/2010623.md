were provided.*

<span id="iv.vi.iv.xxxvii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.xxxvii-p2.1"></span>Such</span> were the emperor’s
commands, which were followed by the immediate execution of the work
itself, which we sent him in magnificent and elaborately bound volumes
of a threefold and fourfold form. <span
id="fr_3335"></span>[3336](#fn_3335) This fact is attested by another
letter, which the emperor wrote in acknowledgment, in which, having
heard that the city Constantia in our country, the inhabitants of which
had been more than commonly devoted to superstition, had been impelled
by a sense of religion to abandon their past idolatry, he testified his
joy, and approval of their conduct.

usually arranged in quaternions, i.e. four leaves made up together, as
the ternions consisted of three leaves. The quaternions each contained
sixteen pages, the ternions twelve (Valesius in loc.).—*Bag.*\] So
probably, although the three-columned form of the Sinaiticus and the
four of the Vaticanus suggest a possible other meaning.
