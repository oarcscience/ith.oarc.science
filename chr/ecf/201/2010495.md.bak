<span id="iv.vi.ii.l-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.l-p1.1"></span>Chapter L</span>.—*That the Persecution
originated on Account of the Oracle of Apollo, who, it was said, could
not give Oracles because of “the Righteous Men.”*

<span id="iv.vi.ii.l-p2"></span>“<span class="c13"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.l-p2.1"></span>About</span> that time it is said that
Apollo spoke from a deep and gloomy cavern, and through the medium of no
human voice, and declared that *the righteous men* on earth were a bar
to his speaking the truth, and accordingly that the oracles from the
tripod were fallacious. Hence it was that he suffered his tresses to
droop in token of grief, <span id="fr_3198"></span>[3199](#fn_3198.md) and
mourned the evils which the loss of the oracular spirit would entail on
mankind. But let us mark the consequences of this.
