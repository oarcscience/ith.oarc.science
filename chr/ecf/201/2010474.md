<span id="iv.vi.ii.xxix-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.xxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIX</span>.—*Constantine’s
Expressions of Piety towards God; and Praise of the Confessors.*

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xxix-p2"></span>“I <span class="c13"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.xxix-p2.1"></span>said</span>, <span
id="fr_3184"></span>[3185](#fn_3184.md) under the guidance of his hand; for
I would desire never to be forgetful of the gratitude due to his grace.
Believing, therefore, that this most excellent service had been confided
to me as a special gift, I proceeded as far as the regions of the East,
which, being under the pressure of severer calamities, seemed to demand
still more effectual remedies at my hands. At the same time I am most
certainly persuaded that I myself owe my life, my every breath, in
short, my very inmost and secret thoughts, entirely to the favor of the
Supreme God. Now I am well aware that they who are sincere in the
pursuit of the heavenly hope, and have fixed this hope in heaven itself
as the peculiar and predominant principle of their lives, have no need
to depend on human favor, but rather have enjoyed higher honors in
proportion as they have separated themselves from the inferior and evil
things of this earthly existence. Nevertheless I deem it <span
id="page_508">p. 508</span> <span
id="iv.vi.ii.xxix-Page_508"></span>incumbent on me to remove at once and
most completely from all such persons the hard necessities laid upon
them for a season, and the unjust inflictions under which they have
suffered, though free from any guilt or just liability. For it would be
strange indeed, that the fortitude and constancy of soul displayed by
such men should be fully apparent during the reign of those whose first
object it was to persecute them on account of their devotion to God, and
yet that the glory of their character should not be more bright and
blessed, under the administration of a prince who is His servant.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xxix-p3"></span> \[“I said, under the guidance,” &c.
It seems necessary to supply some expression of this kind, in order to
preserve the sense, which is otherwise interrupted by the division (in
this instance, at least, manifestly improper) into chapters.—*Bag.*\]
