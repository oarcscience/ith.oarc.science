id="iii.xiv.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII.</span>

<span id="iii.xiv.xiii-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xiv.xiii-p2.1"></span>I think</span> it best to pass by all the
other events which occurred in the meantime: such as those which
happened to the bishops of the churches, when instead of shepherds of
the rational <span id="fr_2693"></span>[2694](#fn_2693) flocks of
Christ, over which they presided in an unlawful manner, the divine
judgment, considering them worthy of such a charge, made them keepers of
camels, <span id="fr_2694"></span>[2695](#fn_2694) an irrational
beast <span id="fr_2695"></span>[2696](#fn_2695) and very crooked in the
structure of its body, or condemned them to have the care of the
imperial horses;—and I pass by also the insults and disgraces and
tortures they endured from the imperial overseers and rulers on account
of the sacred vessels and treasures of the Church; and besides these the
lust of power on the part of many, the disorderly and unlawful
ordinations, and the schisms among the confessors themselves; also the
novelties which were zealously devised against the remnants of the
Church by the new and factious members, who added innovation after
innovation and forced them in unsparingly among the calamities of the
persecution, heaping misfortune upon misfortune. I judge it more
suitable to shun and avoid the account of these things, as I said at the
beginning. <span id="fr_2696"></span>[2697](#fn_2696) But such things as
are sober and praiseworthy, according to the sacred word,—“and if there
be any virtue and praise,” <span id="fr_2697"></span>[2698](#fn_2697) —I
consider it most proper to tell and to record, and to present to
believing hearers in the history of the admirable martyrs. And after
this I think it best to crown the entire work with an account of the
peace which has appeared unto us from heaven.

<span id="iii.xiv.xiii-p4"></span> “It was a punishment among the Romans
that freemen should be condemned to take care of the emperor’s horses or
camels, and to perform other personal offices of that kind” (Valesius).
For fuller particulars, see Valesius’ note *ad locum.* In the *Acts of
St. Marcellus* (who was bishop of Rome) we are told that he was set by
Maximian to groom his horses in a church which the emperor had turned
into a stable.
