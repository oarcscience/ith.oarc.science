<span id="iii.vii.xxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.vii.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIII.—</span>*The Martyrdom of
James, who was called the Brother of the Lord.*

<span id="iii.vii.xxiv-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.vii.xxiv-p2.1"></span>But</span> after Paul, in consequence of
his appeal to Cæsar, had been sent to Rome by Festus, the Jews, being
frustrated in their hope of entrapping him by the snares which they had
laid for him, turned against James, the brother of the Lord, <span
id="fr_483"></span>[484](#fn_483.md) to whom the episcopal seat at
Jerusalem had been entrusted by the apostles. <span
id="fr_484"></span>[485](#fn_484.md) The following daring measures were
undertaken by them against him.

<span id="iii.vii.xxiv-p5"></span>2. Leading him into their midst they
demanded of him that he should renounce faith in Christ in the presence
of all the people. But, contrary to the opinion of all, with a clear
voice, and with greater boldness than they had anticipated, he spoke out
before the whole multitude and confessed that our Saviour and Lord Jesus
is the Son of God. But they were unable to bear longer the testimony of
the man who, on account of the excellence of ascetic virtue <span
id="fr_485"></span>[486](#fn_485.md) and of piety which he exhibited in his
life, was esteemed by all as the most just of men, and consequently they
slew him. Opportunity for this deed of violence was furnished by the
prevailing anarchy, which was caused by the fact that Festus had died
just at this time in Judea, and that the province was thus without a
governor and head. <span id="fr_486"></span>[487](#fn_486.md)

<span id="iii.vii.xxiv-p8"></span>3. The manner of James’ death has been
already indicated by the above-quoted words of Clement, who records that
he was thrown from the pinnacle of the temple, and was beaten to death
with a club. <span id="fr_487"></span>[488](#fn_487.md) But
Hegesippus, <span id="fr_488"></span>[489](#fn_488.md) who lived
immediately after the apostles, gives the most accurate account in the
fifth book of his Memoirs. <span id="fr_489"></span>[490](#fn_489.md) He
writes as follows:

<span id="iii.vii.xxiv-p12"></span>4. “James, the brother of the Lord,
succeeded to the government of the Church in conjunction with the
apostles. <span id="fr_490"></span>[491](#fn_490.md) He has been called the
Just <span id="fr_491"></span>[492](#fn_491.md) by all from the time of our
Saviour to the present day; for there were many that bore the name of
James.

<span id="iii.vii.xxiv-p15"></span>5. He was holy from his mother’s
womb; and he drank no wine nor strong drink, nor did he eat flesh. No
razor came upon his head; he did not anoint himself with oil, and he did
not use the bath.

<span id="iii.vii.xxiv-p16"></span>6. He alone was permitted to enter
into the holy place; for he wore not woolen but linen garments. And he
was in the habit of entering alone into the temple, and was frequently
found upon his knees begging forgiveness for the people, so that his
knees became hard like those of a camel, in consequence of his
constantly bending them in his worship of God, and asking forgiveness
for the people. <span id="fr_492"></span>[493](#fn_492.md)

<span id="iii.vii.xxiv-p18"></span>7. Because of his exceeding great
justice he was called the Just, and Oblias, <span
id="fr_493"></span>[494](#fn_493.md) which signifies in Greek, ‘Bulwark of
the people’ and ‘Justice,’ <span id="fr_494"></span>[495](#fn_494.md) in
accordance with what the prophets declare concerning him. <span
id="fr_495"></span>[496](#fn_495.md)

<span id="iii.vii.xxiv-p22"></span>8. Now some of the seven sects, which
existed among the people and which have been mentioned by me in the
Memoirs, <span id="fr_496"></span>[497](#fn_496.md) asked him, ‘What is the
gate of Jesus?’ <span id="fr_497"></span>[498](#fn_497.md) <span
id="page_126">p. 126</span> <span id="iii.vii.xxiv-Page_126"></span>and
he replied that he was the Saviour.

<span id="iii.vii.xxiv-p25"></span>9. On account of these words some
believed that Jesus is the Christ. But the sects mentioned above did not
believe either in a resurrection or in one’s coming to give to every man
according to his works. <span id="fr_498"></span>[499](#fn_498.md) But as
many as believed did so on account of James.

<span id="iii.vii.xxiv-p27"></span>10. Therefore when many even of the
rulers believed, there was a commotion among the Jews and Scribes and
Pharisees, who said that there was danger that the whole people would be
looking for Jesus as the Christ. Coming therefore in a body to James
they said, ‘We entreat thee, restrain the people; for they are gone
astray in regard to Jesus, as if he were the Christ. <span
id="fr_499"></span>[500](#fn_499.md) We entreat thee to persuade all that
have come to the feast of the Passover concerning Jesus; for we all have
confidence in thee. For we bear thee witness, as do all the people, that
thou art just, and dost not respect persons. <span
id="fr_500"></span>[501](#fn_500.md)

<span id="iii.vii.xxiv-p30"></span>11. Do thou therefore persuade the
multitude not to be led astray concerning Jesus. For the whole people,
and all of us also, have confidence in thee. Stand therefore upon the
pinnacle of the temple, <span id="fr_501"></span>[502](#fn_501.md) that
from that high position thou mayest be clearly seen, and that thy words
may be readily heard by all the people. For all the tribes, with the
Gentiles also, are come together on account of the Passover.’

<span id="iii.vii.xxiv-p32"></span>12. The aforesaid Scribes and
Pharisees therefore placed James upon the pinnacle of the temple, and
cried out to him and said: ‘Thou just one, in whom we ought all to have
confidence, forasmuch as the people are led astray after Jesus, the
crucified one, declare to us, what is the gate of Jesus.’ <span
id="fr_502"></span>[503](#fn_502.md)

<span id="iii.vii.xxiv-p34"></span>13. And he answered with a loud
voice, ‘Why do ye ask me concerning Jesus, the Son of Man? He himself
sitteth in heaven at the right hand of the great Power, and is about to
come upon the clouds of heaven.’ <span id="fr_503"></span>[504](#fn_503.md)

<span id="iii.vii.xxiv-p36"></span>14. And when many were fully
convinced and gloried in the testimony of James, and said, ‘Hosanna to
the Son of David,’ these same Scribes and Pharisees said again to one
another, ‘We have done badly in supplying such testimony to Jesus. But
let us go up and throw him down, in order that they may be afraid to
believe him.’

<span id="iii.vii.xxiv-p37"></span>15. And they cried out, saying, ‘Oh!
oh! the just man is also in error.’ And they fulfilled the Scripture
written in Isaiah, <span id="fr_504"></span>[505](#fn_504.md) ‘Let us take
away <span id="fr_505"></span>[506](#fn_505.md) the just man, because he is
troublesome to us: therefore they shall eat the fruit of their doings.’

<span id="iii.vii.xxiv-p40"></span>16. So they went up and threw down
the just man, and said to each other, ‘Let us stone James the Just.’ And
they began to stone him, for he was not killed by the fall; but he
turned and knelt down and said, ‘I entreat thee, Lord God our
Father, <span id="fr_506"></span>[507](#fn_506.md) forgive them, for they
know not what they do.’ <span id="fr_507"></span>[508](#fn_507.md)

<span id="iii.vii.xxiv-p43"></span>17. And while they were thus stoning
him one of the priests of the sons of Rechab, the son of the
Rechabites, <span id="fr_508"></span>[509](#fn_508.md) who are mentioned by
Jeremiah the prophet, <span id="fr_509"></span>[510](#fn_509.md) cried out,
saying, ‘Cease, what do ye? The just one prayeth for you.’ <span
id="fr_510"></span>[511](#fn_510.md)

<span id="iii.vii.xxiv-p47"></span><span id="page_127">p. 127</span>
<span id="iii.vii.xxiv-Page_127"></span>18. And one of them, who was a
fuller, took the club with which he beat out clothes and struck the just
man on the head. And thus he suffered martyrdom. <span
id="fr_511"></span>[512](#fn_511.md) And they buried him on the spot, by
the temple, and his monument still remains by the temple. <span
id="fr_512"></span>[513](#fn_512.md) He became a true witness, both to Jews
and Greeks, that Jesus is the Christ. And immediately Vespasian besieged
them.” <span id="fr_513"></span>[514](#fn_513.md)

<span id="iii.vii.xxiv-p51"></span>19. These things are related at
length by Hegesippus, who is in agreement with Clement. <span
id="fr_514"></span>[515](#fn_514.md) James was so admirable a man and so
celebrated among all for his justice, that the more sensible even of the
Jews were of the opinion that this was the cause of the siege of
Jerusalem, which happened to them immediately after his martyrdom for no
other reason than their daring act against him.

<span id="iii.vii.xxiv-p53"></span>20. Josephus, at least, has not
hesitated to testify this in his writings, where he says, <span
id="fr_515"></span>[516](#fn_515.md) “These things happened to the Jews to
avenge James the Just, who was a brother of Jesus, that is called the
Christ. For the Jews slew him, although he was a most just man.”

<span id="iii.vii.xxiv-p55"></span>21. And the same writer records his
death also in the twentieth book of his Antiquities in the following
words: <span id="fr_516"></span>[517](#fn_516.md) “But the emperor, when he
learned of the death of Festus, sent Albinus <span
id="fr_517"></span>[518](#fn_517.md) to be procurator of Judea. But the
younger Ananus, <span id="fr_518"></span>[519](#fn_518.md) who, as we have
already said, <span id="fr_519"></span>[520](#fn_519.md) had obtained the
high priesthood, was of an exceedingly bold and reckless disposition. He
belonged, moreover, to the sect of the Sadducees, who are the most cruel
of all the Jews in the execution of judgment, as we have already
shown. <span id="fr_520"></span>[521](#fn_520.md)

<span id="iii.vii.xxiv-p61"></span>22. Ananus, therefore, being of this
character, and supposing that he had a favorable opportunity on account
of the fact that Festus was dead, and Albinus was still on the way,
called together the Sanhedrim, and brought before them the brother of
Jesus, the so-called Christ, James by name, together with some
others, <span id="fr_521"></span>[522](#fn_521.md) and accused them of
violating the law, and condemned them to be stoned. <span
id="fr_522"></span>[523](#fn_522.md)

<span id="iii.vii.xxiv-p64"></span>23. But those in the city who seemed
most moderate and skilled in the law were very angry at this, and sent
secretly to the king, <span id="fr_523"></span>[524](#fn_523.md) requesting
him to order Ananus to cease such proceedings. For he had not done right
even this first time. And certain of them also went to meet Albinus, who
was journeying from Alexandria, and reminded him that it was not lawful
for Ananus to summon the Sanhedrim without his knowledge. <span
id="fr_524"></span>[525](#fn_524.md)

<span id="iii.vii.xxiv-p67"></span>24. And Albinus, being <span
id="page_128">p. 128</span> <span
id="iii.vii.xxiv-Page_128"></span>persuaded by their representations,
wrote in anger to Ananus, threatening him with punishment. And the king,
Agrippa, in consequence, deprived him of the high priesthood, <span
id="fr_525"></span>[526](#fn_525.md) which he had held three months, and
appointed Jesus, the son of Damnæus.” <span
id="fr_526"></span>[527](#fn_526.md)

<span id="iii.vii.xxiv-p70"></span>25. These things are recorded in
regard to James, who is said to be the author of the first of the
so-called catholic <span id="fr_527"></span>[528](#fn_527.md) epistles. But
it is to be observed that it is disputed; <span
id="fr_528"></span>[529](#fn_528.md) at least, not many of the ancients
have mentioned it, as is the case likewise with the epistle that bears
the name of Jude, <span id="fr_529"></span>[530](#fn_529.md) which is also
one of the seven so-called catholic epistles. Nevertheless we know that
these also, <span id="fr_530"></span>[531](#fn_530.md) with the rest, have
been read publicly in very many churches. <span

id="iii.vii.xxiv-p10.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vii.xxiv-p11"></span> As the Memoirs of Hegesippus
consisted of but five books, this account of James occurred in the last
book, and this shows how entirely lacking the work was in all
chronological arrangement (cf. Book IV. chap. 22). This fragment is
given by Routh, *Rel. Sac.* I. p. 208 sqq., with a valuable discussion
on p. 228 sqq.

<span id="fn_490"></span>[125:491](2010065.htm#fr_490.md) <span
id="iii.vii.xxiv-p12.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vii.xxiv-p13"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vii.xxiv-p13.1"></span>μετὰ τῶν ἀποστόλων</span>, “with the
apostles”; as Rufinus rightly translates, *cum apostolis.* Jerome, on
the contrary, reads *post apostolos,* “after the apostles,” as if the
Greek were <span class="Greek"><span id="iii.vii.xxiv-p13.2"></span>μετὰ
τοὺς ἀποστόλους</span>. This statement of Hegesippus is correct. James
was a leader of the Jerusalem church, in company with Peter and John, as
we see from [Gal. ii. 9](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#009.md)<span
id="iii.vii.xxiv-p13.3"></span>. But that is quite different from
saying, as Eusebius does just above, and as Clement (quoted by Eusebius,
chap. 1, §3) does, that he was appointed Bishop of Jerusalem by the
apostles. See chap. 1, note 11.

<span id="fn_491"></span>[125:492](2010065.htm#fr_491.md) <span
id="iii.vii.xxiv-p13.4"></span>

<span id="iii.vii.xxiv-p14"></span> See chap. 1, note 6.

<span id="fn_492"></span>[125:493](2010065.htm#fr_492.md) <span
id="iii.vii.xxiv-p16.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vii.xxiv-p17"></span> “The dramatic account of James by
Hegesippus is an overdrawn picture from the middle of the second
century, colored by Judaizing traits which may have been derived from
the *Ascents of James,* and other Apocryphal sources. He turns James
into a Jewish priest and Nazarite saint (cf. his advice to Paul, <span
id="iii.vii.xxiv-p17.1"></span>[Acts
21:23](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#023.md),
[24](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#024.md)<span
id="iii.vii.xxiv-p17.2"></span>), who drank no wine, ate no flesh, never
shaved nor took a bath, and wore only linen. But the Biblical James is
Pharisaic and legalistic, rather than Essenic and ascetic” (Schaff, *Ch.
Hist.* I. p. 268). For Peter’s asceticism, see the Clementine
*Recognitions,* VII. 6; and for Matthew’s, see Clement of Alexandria’s
*Pædagogus,* II. 1.

<span id="fn_493"></span>[125:494](2010065.htm#fr_493.md) <span
id="iii.vii.xxiv-p18.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vii.xxiv-p19"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vii.xxiv-p19.1"></span>᾽</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vii.xxiv-p19.2"></span>Ω</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vii.xxiv-p19.3"></span>βλίας</span>: probably a corruption of
the Heb. <span class="Hebrew"><span id="iii.vii.xxiv-p19.4"></span>אֹפֶל
עַם</span>, which signifies “bulwark of the people.” The same name is
given to James by Epiphanius, by Dionysius the Areopagite, and others.
See Suicer, *Thesaurus Ecclesiasticus,* s.v.

<span id="fn_495"></span>[125:496](2010065.htm#fr_495.md) <span
id="iii.vii.xxiv-p20.2"></span>

<span id="iii.vii.xxiv-p21"></span> To what Hegesippus refers I do not
know, as there is no passage in the prophets which can be interpreted in
this way. He may have been thinking of the passage from Isaiah quoted in
§15, below, but the reference is certainly very much strained.

<span id="fn_496"></span>[125:497](2010065.htm#fr_496.md) <span
id="iii.vii.xxiv-p22.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vii.xxiv-p23"></span> See Bk. IV. chap. 22.

<span id="fn_497"></span>[125:498](2010065.htm#fr_497.md) <span
id="iii.vii.xxiv-p23.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vii.xxiv-p24"></span> For a discussion of this very
difficult question, whose interpretation has puzzled all commentators,
see Routh *Rel. Sac.* I. p. 434 sq., and Heinichen’s Mel. IV., in his
edition of Eusebius, Vol. III., p. 654 sqq. The explanation given by
Grabe (in his *Spic. PP.* p. 254), seems to me the best. According to
him, the Jews wish to ascertain James’ opinion in regard to Christ,
whether he considers him a true guide or an impostor, and therefore they
ask, “What (of what sort) is the gate (or the way) of Christ? Is it a
gate which opens into life (or a way which leads to life); or is it a
gate which opens upon death (or a way which leads to death)?” Cf. [Matt.
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#013.md),
[14](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#014.md)<span
id="iii.vii.xxiv-p24.1"></span>, where the two ways and the two gates
are compared. The Jews had undoubtedly often heard Christ called “the
Way,” and thus they might naturally use the expression in asking James’
opinion about Jesus, “Is he the true or the false way?” or, “Is this way
true or false?” The answer of James which follows is then perfectly
consistent: “He is the Saviour,” in which words he expresses as
decidedly as he can his belief that the way or the gate of Christ led to
salvation. And so below, in §12, where he gives a second answer to the
question, expressing his belief in Christ still more emphatically. This
is somewhat similar to the explanation of Heinichen (*ibid.* p. 659
sq.), who construes the genitive <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vii.xxiv-p24.2"></span>᾽</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vii.xxiv-p24.3"></span>Ιησοῦ</span> as in virtual apposition to
<span class="Greek"><span id="iii.vii.xxiv-p24.4"></span>θύρα</span>:
“What is this way, Jesus?” But Grabe seems to bring out most clearly the
true meaning of the question.

<span id="fn_498"></span>[126:499](2010065.htm#fr_498.md) <span
id="iii.vii.xxiv-p25.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vii.xxiv-p26"></span> Rufinus translates *non crediderunt
neque surrexisse eum,* &c., and he is followed by Fabricius (*Cod. Apoc.
N. T.* II. p. 603). This rendering suits the context excellently, and
seems to be the only rendering which gives any meaning to the following
sentence. And yet, as our Greek stands, it is impossible to translate
thus, as both <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vii.xxiv-p26.1"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vii.xxiv-p26.2"></span>ν€στασιν</span> and <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.vii.xxiv-p26.3"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.vii.xxiv-p26.4"></span>ρχόμενον</span> are
left entirely indefinite. The Greek runs, <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vii.xxiv-p26.5"></span>οὐκ ἐπίστευον ἀν€στασιν, οὐτε ἐρχόμενον
ἀποδοῦναι, κ.τ.λ</span>. Cf. the notes of Valesius and of Heinichen on
this passage. Of these seven sects, so far as we know, only one, the
Sadducees, disbelieved in the resurrection from the dead. If Hegesippus’
words, therefore, be understood of a general resurrection, he is
certainly in error.

<span id="fn_499"></span>[126:500](2010065.htm#fr_499.md) <span
id="iii.vii.xxiv-p27.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vii.xxiv-p28"></span> This sentence sufficiently reveals
the legendary character of Hegesippus’ account. James’ position as a
Christian must have been well enough known to prevent such a request
being made to him in good faith (and there is no sign that it was made
in any other spirit); and at any rate, after his reply to them already
recorded, such a repetition of the question in public is absurd.
Fabricius, who does not think the account is true, says that, if it is,
the Jews seem to have asked him a second time, thinking that they could
either flatter or frighten him into denying Christ.

<span id="fn_500"></span>[126:501](2010065.htm#fr_500.md) <span
id="iii.vii.xxiv-p28.1"></span>

<span id="fn_501"></span>[126:502](2010065.htm#fr_501.md) <span

<span class="Greek"><span id="iii.vii.xxiv-p31.4"></span>τοῦ

reproduction in Greek letters of the Hebrew plural, and is equivalent to
“the Rechabites.” But Hegesippus uses it without any article as if it

class="Greek"><span id="iii.vii.xxiv-p44.3"></span>῾</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.vii.xxiv-p44.4"></span>Ρηχ€β</span> which
immediately precedes. The Rechabites were a tribe who took their origin
from Jehonadab, the son of Rechab, who appears from <span
id="iii.vii.xxiv-p44.5"></span>[1 Chron. ii.
55](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#055.md)<span
id="iii.vii.xxiv-p44.6"></span> to have belonged to a branch of the
Kenites, the Arabian tribe which came into Palestine with the
Israelites. Jehonadab enjoined upon his descendants a nomadic and
ascetic mode of life, which they observed with great strictness for
centuries, and received a blessing from God on account of their
steadfastness ([Jer. xxxv. 19](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#019.md)<span
id="iii.vii.xxiv-p44.7"></span>). That a Rechabite, who did not belong
to the tribe of Judah, nor even to the genuine people of Israel, should
have been a priest seems at first sight inexplicable. Different
solutions have been offered. Some think that Hegesippus was
mistaken,—the source from which he took his account having confounded
this ascetic Rechabite with a priest,—but this is hardly probable.
Plumptre, in Smith’s *Bib. Dict.* art. *Rechabites* (which see for a
full account of the tribe), thinks that the blessing pronounced upon
them by God (<span id="iii.vii.xxiv-p44.8"></span>[Jer. xxxv.
19](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#019.md)<span
id="iii.vii.xxiv-p44.9"></span>) included their solemn adoption among
the people of Israel, and their incorporation into the tribe of Levi,
and therefore into the number of the priests. Others (e.g. Tillemont,
*H. E.* I. p. 633) have supposed that many Jews, including also priests,
embraced the practices and the institutions of the Rechabites and were
therefore identified with them. The language here, however, seems to
imply a native Rechabite, and it is probable that Hegesippus at least
believed this person to be such, whether his belief was correct or not.

these words are put into the mouth of Simeon, the son of Clopas; from
which some have concluded that Simeon had joined the order of the
Rechabites; but there is no ground for such an assumption. The Simeon of
Epiphanius and the Rechabite of Hegesippus are not necessarily
identical. They represent simply varieties of the original account, and
Epiphanius’, as the more exact, was undoubtedly the later tradition, and
an intentional improvement upon the vagueness of the original.

<span id="iii.vii.xxiv-p48"></span> Clement (in chap. 5, §4, above), who
undoubtedly used the account of Hegesippus as his source, describes the
death of James as taking place in the same way, but omits the stoning
which preceded. Josephus, on the other hand (quoted below), mentions
only the stoning. But Hegesippus’ account, which is the fullest that we
have gives us the means of reconciling the briefer accounts of Clement
and of Josephus, and we have no reason to think either account
incorrect.

<span id="iii.vii.xxiv-p49"></span> Valesius remarks that the monument
(<span class="Greek"><span id="iii.vii.xxiv-p49.1"></span>στήλη</span>)
could not have stood through the destruction of Jerusalem until the time
of Hegesippus, nor could James have been buried near the temple, as the
Jews always buried their dead without the city walls. Tillemont
attempted to meet the difficulty by supposing that James was thrown from
a pinnacle of the temple overlooking the Valley of Jehoshaphat, and
therefore fell without the walls, where he was stoned and buried, and
where his monument could remain undisturbed. Tillemont however,
afterward withdrew his explanation, which was beset with difficulties.
Others have supposed that the monument mentioned by Hegesippus was
erected after the destruction of Jerusalem (cf. Jerome, *de vir. ill.*
2), while his body was buried in another place. This is quite possible,
as Hegesippus must have seen some monument of James which was reported
to have been the original one but which must certainly have been of
later date. A monument, which is now commonly known as the tomb of St.
James, is shown upon the east side of the Valley of Jehoshaphat, and
therefore at a considerable distance from the temple. See Routh, *Rel.
Sac.* I. p. 246 sqq.

<span id="iii.vii.xxiv-p54"></span> This passage is not found in our

Origen (*Contra Celsum,* I. 47), which shows at any rate that Eusebius
did not invent the words. It is probable therefore, that the copies of
Josephus used by Origen and Eusebius contained this interpolation, while
the copies from which our existing <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.vii.xxiv-p54.2"></span>mss.</span> drew were without it. It is
of course possible, especially since he does not mention the reference
in Josephus, that Eusebius quoted these words from Origen. But this does
not help matters any, as it still remains as difficult to account for
the occurrence of the words in Origen, and even if Eusebius did take the
passage from Origen instead of from Josephus himself, we still have no
right with Jachmann (*ib.* p. 40) to accuse him of wilful deception. For
with his great confidence in Origen, and his unbounded admiration for
him, and with his naturally uncritical spirit, he would readily accept
as true in all good faith a quotation given by Origen and purporting to
be taken from Josephus, even though he could not find it in his own copy
of the latter’s works.

spurious, but Neander, *Gesch. der Pflanzung und Leitung der
Christlichen Kirche,* 5th ed., p. 445, note, contends for their
genuineness, and this is now the common opinion of critics. It is in
fact very difficult to suppose that a Christian in interpolating the
passage, would have referred to James as the brother of the “*so-called*
Christ.” On the other hand, as the words stand there is no good reason
to doubt their genuineness.

<span id="iii.vii.xxiv-p63"></span> The date of the martyrdom of James,
given here by Josephus, is 61 or 62 <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.vii.xxiv-p63.1"></span>a.d.</span> (at the time of the Passover,
according to Hegesippus, §10, above). There is no reason for doubting
this date which is given with such exactness by Josephus, and it is
further confirmed by Eusebius in his *Chron.,* who puts James’s
martyrdom in the seventh year of Nero, i.e. 61 <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.vii.xxiv-p63.2"></span>a.d.</span>, while Jerome puts it in the
eighth year of Nero. The Clementines and the *Chronicon Paschale,* which
state that James survived Peter, and are therefore cited in support of a
later date, are too late to be of any weight over against such an exact
statement as that of Josephus, especially since Peter and James died at
such a distance from one another. Hegesippus has been cited over and
over again by historians as assigning the date of the martyrdom to 69
<span class="c13"><span id="iii.vii.xxiv-p63.3"></span>a.d.</span>, and
as thus being in direct conflict with Josephus; as a consequence some
follow his supposed date, others that of Josephus. But I can find no
reason for asserting that Hegesippus assigns the martyrdom to 69.
Certainly his words in this chapter, which are referred to, by no means
necessitate such an assumption. He concludes his account with the words
<span class="Greek"><span id="iii.vii.xxiv-p63.4"></span>καὶ εὐθὺς
Οὐεσπασιανὸς πολιορκεῖ αὐτούς</span>. The <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vii.xxiv-p63.5"></span>πολιορκεῖ αὐτούς</span> is certainly to
be referred to the commencement of the war (not to the siege of the city
of Jerusalem, which was undertaken by Titus, not by Vespasian), i.e. to
the year 67 <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.vii.xxiv-p63.6"></span>a.d.</span>, and in such an account as
this, in which the overthrow of the Jews is designedly presented in
connection with the death of James, it is hyper-criticism to insist that
the word <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vii.xxiv-p63.7"></span>εὐθύς</span> must indicate a space of
time of only a few months’ duration. It is a very indefinite word, and
the most we can draw from Hegesippus’ account is that not long before
Vespasian’s invasion of Judea, James was slain. The same may be said in
regard to Eusebius’ report in Bk. III. chap. 11, §1, which certainly is
not definite enough to be cited as a contradiction of his express
statement in his *Chronicle.* But however it may be with this report and
that of Hegesippus, the date given by Josephus is undoubtedly to be
accepted as correct.

instead of <span class="Greek"><span

consequently draws the conclusion that the Sanhedrim could be called
only with the consent of Agrippa, and that therefore Ananus had acted
contrary to the rights of Agrippa, but not contrary to the rights of
Albinus. But the reading <span class="Greek"><span

<span class="c13"><span id="iii.vii.xxiv-p66.8"></span>ms.</span>

class="Greek"><span id="iii.vii.xxiv-p66.10"></span>κείνου</span> forced
upon him, is quite incorrect. The passage appears to imply that the
Sanhedrim could be called only with the consent of the procurator, and
it has been so interpreted; but as Schürer points out (*Gesch. der Juden
im Zeitalter Jesu Christi,* p. 169 sq.) this conclusion is incorrect and
all that the passage implies is that the Sanhedrim could not hold a
sovereign process, that is, could not meet for the purpose of passing
sentence of death and executing the sentence, during the absence or
without the consent of the procurator. For the transaction of ordinary
business the consent of the procurator was not necessary. Compare the

<span id="iii.vii.xxiv-p71"></span> This term was applied to all or a
part of these seven epistles by the Alexandrian Clement, Origen, and
Dionysius, and since the time of Eusebius has been the common
designation. The word is used in the sense of “general,” to denote that
the epistles are encyclical letters addressed to no particular persons
or congregations, though this is not true of II. and III. John, which,
however, are classed with the others on account of their supposed
Johannine authorship, and consequent close connection with his first
epistle. The word was not first used, as some have held, in the sense of
“canonical,” to denote the catholic or general acceptance of the
epistle,—a meaning which Eusebius contradicts in this very passage, and
which the history of the epistles themselves (five of the seven being
among the antilegomena) sufficiently refutes. See Holtzmann’s
*Einleitung,* p. 472 sqq., and Weiss, *ibid.* p. 89 sqq.

<span id="iii.vii.xxiv-p72"></span> <span class="Greek"><span

translate the word <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vii.xxiv-p72.2"></span>νόθος</span>, “spurious” (and the kindred
verb, “to be spurious”); but it is plain enough from this passage, as
also from others that Eusebius did not employ the word in that sense. He
commonly used it in fact, in a loose way, to mean “disputed,” in the
same sense in which he often employed the word <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vii.xxiv-p72.3"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vii.xxiv-p72.4"></span>ντιλεγόμενος</span>. Lücke, indeed,
maintained that Eusebius always used the words <span class="Greek"><span

class="Greek"><span id="iii.vii.xxiv-p72.6"></span>ἀ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.vii.xxiv-p72.7"></span>ντιλεγόμενος</span>
as synonymous; but in Bk. III. chap. 25, as pointed out in note 1 on
that chapter, he employed the words as respective designations of two
distinct classes of books.

<span id="iii.vii.xxiv-p73"></span>The Epistle of James is classed by
Eusebius (in Bk. III. chap. 25) among the antilegomena. The ancient
testimonies for its authenticity are very few. It was used by no one,
except Hermas, down to the end of the second century. Irenæus seems to
have known the epistle (his works exhibit some apparent reminiscences of
it), but he nowhere directly cites it. The Muratorian Fragment omits it,
but the Syriac Peshito contains it, and Clement of Alexandria shows a
few faint reminiscences of it in his extant works, and according to
Eusebius VI. 14, wrote commentaries upon “Jude and the other catholic
epistles.” It is quoted frequently by Origen, who first connects it with
the “Brother of the Lord,” but does not express himself with decision as
to its authenticity. From his time on it was commonly accepted as the
work of “James, the Lord’s brother.” Eusebius throws it among the
antilegomena; not necessarily because he considered it unauthentic, but
because the early testimonies for it are too few to raise it to the
dignity of one of the homologoumena (see Bk. III. chap. 25, note 1).
Luther rejected the epistle upon purely dogmatic grounds. The advanced
critical school are unanimous in considering it a post-apostolic work,
and many conservative scholars agree with them. See Holtzmann’s
*Einleitung,* p. 475 sqq. and Weiss’ *Einleitung,* p. 396 sqq. The
latter defends its authenticity (i.e. the authorship of James, the
brother of the Lord), and, in agreement with many other scholars of
conservative tendencies, throws its origin back into the early part of
the fifties.

<span id="iii.vii.xxiv-p74"></span> The authenticity of the Epistle of
Jude (also classed among the antilegomena by Eusebius in Bk. III. chap.
25) is about as well supported as that of the Epistle of James. The
Peshito does not contain it, and the Syrian Church in general rejected
it for a number of centuries. The Muratorian Fragment accepts it, and
Tertullian evidently considered it a work of Jude, the apostle (see *De
Cultu Fem.* I. 3). The first to quote from it is Clement of Alexandria
who wrote a commentary upon it in connection with the other catholic
epistles according to Eusebius, VI. 14. 1. Origen looked upon it much as
he looked upon the Epistle of James, but did not make the “Jude, the
brother of James,” one of the twelve apostles. Eusebius treats it as he
does James, and Luther, followed by many modern conservative scholars
(among them Neander), rejects it. Its defenders commonly ascribe it to
Jude, the brother of the Lord, in distinction from Jude the apostle, and
put its composition before the destruction of Jerusalem. The advanced
critical school unanimously deny its authenticity, and most of them
throw its composition into the second century, although some put it back
into the latter part of the first. See Holtzmann, p. 501.
