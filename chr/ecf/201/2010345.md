<span id="iv.iii.i.iv"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.i.iv-p1"></span> §4. *Second Five Years.*

<span id="iv.iii.i.iv-p2"></span>This period was most momentous for the
world’s history. Maxentius, seeking an excuse for war against
Constantine, found it in a pretended desire to avenge his father (Zos.
2. 14), and prepared for war. <span id="fr_3012"></span>[3013](#fn_3012.md)
Like his father before him, however, he did not know his man.
Constantine’s mind was prepared. He was alert and ready to act. He
gathered all the forces, German, Gallic, and British (Zos. 2. 15) that
he could muster, left a portion for the protection of the Rhine, entered
Italy by way of the Alps (*Paneg.*), and marched to meet the much more
numerous forces of Maxentius,—Romans, Italians, Tuscans, Carthagenians,
and Sicilians (Zos. 2. 15). <span id="fr_3013"></span>[3014](#fn_3013.md)
First Sigusium was taken by storm (Naz. *Paneg.* \[321\] c. 17 and 21;
*Paneg.* \[313\] c. 5); then the cavalry of Maxentius was defeated at
Turin (Naz. *Paneg.* \[321\] c. 22; *Paneg.* \[313\] c. 6). After a few
days’ rest in Milan (*Paneg.* \[313\] c. 7) he continued his triumphant
march, defeating the enemy again in a cavalry engagement at Brescia
(Naz. *Paneg.* c. 25), and taking the strongly fortified Verona after a
hard-fought battle before the walls (Anon. Vales. p. 473; *Paneg.*
\[313\]; Naz. *Paneg.* c. 25–26). This had taken him out of his way a
little; but now there were no enemies in the rear, and he was free to
push on to Rome, on his way whither, if not earlier, he had his famous
vision of the cross. <span id="fr_3014"></span>[3015](#fn_3014.md) He
reached the Tiber October 26. Maxentius, tempted by a dubious
oracle <span id="fr_3015"></span>[3016](#fn_3015.md) issued from Rome,
crossed the Tiber, and joined battle. His apparently unwise action in
staking so much on a pitched battle has its explanation, if we could
believe Zosimus (2. 15), Eusebius (*V. C.* 1. 38), Praxagoras, and
others. His object was, it is said, by a feigned retreat to tempt
Constantine across the bridge of boats which he had built in such a way
that it could be broken, and the enemy let into the river. <span
id="fr_3016"></span>[3017](#fn_3016.md) If it was a trick, he at least fell
into his own pit. The dissipated soldiers of Maxentius gave way before
the hardy followers of Constantine, fired by his own energy and the
sight of the cross. The defeat was a rout. The bridge broke. Maxentius,
caught in the jam, was cast headlong into the river (Anon. Val. p. 473;
Lact. c. 44; Chron. Pasch. p. 521, &c.); and after a vain attempt to
climb out on the steep bank opposite (*Paneg.* \[313\] c. 17), was swept
away by the stream. The next day his body was found, the head cut off
(Praxag.; Anon. Vales. p. 473), and carried into the city (Anon. Vales.
p. 473) on the point of a spear (*Paneg.* \[313\] c. 18; Zos. 2. 17;
Praxag. p. 1). Constantine entered the city <span id="page_417">p.
417</span> <span id="iv.iii.i.iv-Page_417"></span>in triumph amid
rejoicings of the people, <span id="fr_3017"></span>[3018](#fn_3017.md)
exacted penalties from a few of those most intimate with Maxentius (Zos.
2. 17), <span id="fr_3018"></span>[3019](#fn_3018.md) disbanded the
Prætorian Guards (Vict. *Cæs.* p. 159; Zos. 2. 17), raised a statue to
himself, and did many other things which are recorded; and if he did as
many things which are not recorded as there are recorded things which he
did not do, he must have been very busy in the short time he remained
there. <span id="fr_3019"></span>[3020](#fn_3019.md)

<span id="iv.iii.i.iv-p14"></span>Constantine was now sole emperor in
the West, and the emperors were reduced to three. History was making
fast. After a very brief stay in Rome he returned to Milan (Lact. c.
45), where Licinius met him (Anon. Vales. p. 473; Lact. c. 25; Vict.
*Epit.* p. 50; Zos. 2. 17, &c.). It had become of mutual advantage to
these emperors to join alliance. So a betrothal had been made, and now
the marriage of Licinius to the sister of Constantine was celebrated
(cf. refs. above Lact.; Vict.; Zos.; Anon. Vales.). At the same time the
famous Second Edict or Edict of Milan was drawn up by the two emperors
(Euseb. *H. E.* 10. 5; Lact. c. 48), and probably proclaimed. <span
id="fr_3020"></span>[3021](#fn_3020.md) Constantine then returned to Gaul
(Anon. Vales. p. 473; Zos. 11. 17), where he was forced into another
sort of strenuous warfare—the ecclesiastical, taking a hand somewhat
against his will in trying to settle the famous Donatist schism. <span
id="fr_3021"></span>[3022](#fn_3021.md)

<span id="iv.iii.i.iv-p17"></span>Licinius had a more critical problem
to meet. Maximin thought it a good time to strike while Licinius was off
in Milan engaged in festivities (Lact. c. 45); but the latter, hastily
gathering his troops and pushing on by forced marches, met near Heraclea
and utterly defeated him (Lact. c. 46). Maximin fled precipitately,
escaping the sword only to die a more terrible death that same summer
(Lact. c. 49; Euseb. *V. C.* 1. 58; cf. Zos. 2. 17). <span
id="fr_3022"></span>[3023](#fn_3022.md) The death of Maximin cleared the
field still farther. Through progressive subtractions the number of
emperors had been reduced to two,—one in the East and one in the West.

<span id="iv.iii.i.iv-p19"></span>They, too, promptly fell out. The next
year they were at war. Causes and pretexts were various; but the
pretext, if not the cause, was in general that Licinius proved an
accomplice after the fact, at least, to a plot against
Constantine. <span id="fr_3023"></span>[3024](#fn_3023.md) Whatever the
immediate cause, it was one of <span id="page_418">p. 418</span> <span
id="iv.iii.i.iv-Page_418"></span>the inevitabilities of fate. Another
vigorous campaign followed, characterized by the same decisive action
and personal courage on the part of Constantine which he had already
shown, and which supplied his lack of soldiers. <span
id="fr_3024"></span>[3025](#fn_3024.md) First at Cibalis in Pannonia (Oct.
8), <span id="fr_3025"></span>[3026](#fn_3025.md) then in a desperate
battle at Mardia, Licinius was defeated and forced to make peace (Anon.
Vales. p. 474; Zos. 2. 19–20). The world was re-divided between the
affectionate brothers-in-law, and Constantine took Illyrium to his other
possessions. <span id="fr_3026"></span>[3027](#fn_3026.md) After this
battle and the re-division there was a truce between the emperors for
some years, during the early part of which (in 316 or 315) the
Decennalia of Constantine were celebrated (Euseb. *V. C.* 1. 48).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_3012"></span>[416:3013](2010345.htm#fr_3012.md) <span
id="iv.iii.i.iv-p2.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.i.iv-p3"></span> Eusebius represents the occasion of
Constantine’s movement as a philanthropic compassion for the people of
Rome (*V. C.* 1. 26; *H. E.* 9. 9).

<span id="iv.iii.i.iv-p4"></span>Praxagoras (ed. Müller, p. 1) says
distinctly that it was to avenge those who suffered under the tyrannical
rule of Maxentius and Nazarius (*Paneg.* c. 19), that it was “for
liberating Italy.” So, too, Nazarius (*Paneg.* \[321\] c. 27), Zonaras
(13. 1), Cedrenus, and Ephraem (p. 22) speak of a legation of the Romans
petitioning him to go.

<span id="iv.iii.i.iv-p5"></span>Undoubtedly he did pity them, and as to
the legation, every Roman who found his way to Trèves must have been an
informal ambassador asking help. The fact seems to be that he had long
suspected Maxentius (Zos. 2. 15), and now, learning of his preparations
for war, saw that his suspicions were well grounded. Whatever underlying
motive of personal ambition there may have been, it is probable that the
philanthropic motive was his justification and pretext to his own
conscience for the attempt to rid himself of this suspected and
dangerous neighbor. Zosimus being Zosimus, it is probable that Maxentius
was the aggressor if he says so.

<span id="fn_3013"></span>[416:3014](2010345.htm#fr_3013.md) <span
id="iv.iii.i.iv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.i.iv-p6"></span> Constantine numbered, according to
Zosimus, 90,000 foot, 8,000 horse; and Maxentius, 170,000 foot, and
18,000 horse. According to Panegyr. (313) c. 3, he left the major part
of his army to guard the Rhine and went to meet a force of 100,000 men
with less than 40,000 (c. 5).

<span id="fn_3014"></span>[416:3015](2010345.htm#fr_3014.md) <span
id="iv.iii.i.iv-p6.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.i.iv-p7"></span> See note on Bk. I. c. 28.

<span id="fn_3015"></span>[416:3016](2010345.htm#fr_3015.md) <span
id="iv.iii.i.iv-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.i.iv-p8"></span> That “on the same day the enemy of the
Romans should perish” (Lact. c. 44.).

<span id="fn_3016"></span>[416:3017](2010345.htm#fr_3016.md) <span
id="iv.iii.i.iv-p8.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.i.iv-p9"></span> The circumstance pronounced by
Wordsworth “almost incredible” is witnessed to by Eusebius (*V. C.* 1.
38), Zosimus (2. 15), Praxagoras (ed. Müller, p. 1). The bridge
certainly broke as mentioned by Lactantius (c. 44) and as represented on
the triumphal arch, but whether the “plot” was an *ex post facto* notion
or not is unclear.

<span id="fn_3017"></span>[417:3018](2010345.htm#fr_3017.md) <span
id="iv.iii.i.iv-p9.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.i.iv-p10"></span> “Senate and people rejoiced with
incredible rejoicing” (Vict. *Cæs*. p. 159). Cf. Euseb. *V. C*. 1. 39;
*Paneg.* \[313\] c. 19; Naz. *Paneg.* c. 30; *Chron. Pasch.* p. 521, &c.

<span id="fn_3018"></span>[417:3019](2010345.htm#fr_3018.md) <span
id="iv.iii.i.iv-p10.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.i.iv-p11"></span> It is said he put to death Romulus,
son of Maxentius, but it lacks evidence, and the fact that Romulus was
consul for two years (208–9) with Maxentius, and then Maxentius appears
alone, seems to indicate that he died in 209 or 210 (cf. Clinton, under
the years 208 and 209).

<span id="fn_3019"></span>[417:3020](2010345.htm#fr_3019.md) <span
id="iv.iii.i.iv-p11.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.i.iv-p12"></span> For the churches he is said to have
founded, compare note on Bk. I. ch. 42.

<span id="iv.iii.i.iv-p13"></span>The curious patchwork triumphal arch
which still stands in a state of respectable dilapidation near the
Coliseum at Rome, was erected in honor of this victory. It is to be
hoped that it was erected after Constantine had gone, and that his
æsthetic character is not to be charged with this crime. It was an arch
to Trajan made over for the occasion,—by itself and piecemeal of great
interest. Apart from the mutilation made for the glory of Constantine,
it is a noble piece of work. The changes made were artistic
disfigurements; but art’s loss is science’s gain, and for the historian
it is most interesting. The phrase “*instinctu divinitatis*” has its
value in the “*Hoc signo*” discussion (cf. notes to the *V. C.*); and
the sculptures are most suggestive.

<span id="fn_3020"></span>[417:3021](2010345.htm#fr_3020.md) <span
id="iv.iii.i.iv-p14.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.i.iv-p15"></span> It has been maintained that there
were three edicts of Constantine up to this time: 1. Galerius,
Constantine, and Licinius in 311; 2. Constantine and Licinius in 312
(lost); 3. Constantine and Licinius in 313 (cf. Keim, p. 16 and 81–84;
Zahn, p. 33). So Gass in Herzog, p. 201, Wordsworth (*Ch. Hist.*), and
others. But, like most certain things, it seems to have been disproved.
The “harder edict” seems to have been a product of Eusebius’ rather
slovenly historical method, and to refer to the first, or Galerian
edict.

<span id="fn_3021"></span>[417:3022](2010345.htm#fr_3021.md) <span
id="iv.iii.i.iv-p15.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.i.iv-p16"></span> The appeal of the Donatists to
Constantine was first met by the appointment of a “court of enquiry,”
held at Rome, Oct. 2, 313. The result was unsatisfactory, and
Constantine ordered an examination on the spot, which took place at
Carthage, Feb. 15, 314 (Phillott). The Donatists still urging, the
Council of Arles was called, Aug. 1, 314, and some progress seemed to be
made, but progress more satisfactory to the orthodox than to the
schismatics, who urged again that Constantine hear the matter himself,
as he finally did, November, 316 (Wordsworth; cf. Augustine, *Ep.* 43,
¶20). He confirmed the previous findings, and took vigorous but
ineffective measures to suppress the Donatists, measures which he saw
afterwards could not be carried out, and perhaps saw to be unjust.
Compare Augustine, *Ep.* 43, ch. 2, and elsewhere, also various
documents from Augustine, Lactantius, Eusebius, Optatus, &c., collected
in Migne, *Patrol. Lat.* 8 (1844), 673–784. Compare also Fuller,
*Donatism,* Phillott, *Felix,*—articles in Smith and W. *Dict.* &c.; and
for general sources and literature, cf. *Donatist Schism,* Hartranft, in
Schaff, *Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers,* 4 (1887), 369–72; Völter,
*Ursprung des Donatismus,* 1883; and Seeck in Brieger’s *Zeitschrift f.
Kirchengeschichte,* 10 (1889), 505–508.

<span id="fn_3022"></span>[417:3023](2010345.htm#fr_3022.md) <span
id="iv.iii.i.iv-p17.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.i.iv-p18"></span> According to Lactantius (c. 49), an
attempt at suicide by poison was followed by a wretched disease,
bringing to a lingering and most painful death.

<span id="fn_3023"></span>[417:3024](2010345.htm#fr_3023.md) <span
id="iv.iii.i.iv-p19.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.i.iv-p20"></span> Bassianus, who had married Anastasia,
sister of Constantine, was incited by his brother, who was an adherent
of Licinius, to revolt against Constantine. The attempt was nipped in
the bud, and Constantine demanded from Licinius the author of the plot.
His refusal, together with the throwing down of the statues of
Constantine, was the direct occasion of the war (Anon. Vales. p. 473).
Compare Eusebius, *V. C.* 1. 50–51, and Socr. 1. 3, where Licinius is
charged with repeated treachery, perjury, and hypocrisy. Zosimus, on the
other hand (2. 18), distinctly says that Licinius was not to blame, but
that Constantine, with characteristic faithlessness to their agreement,
tried to alienate some of Licinius’ provinces. Here, however, notice
that Zosimus would not count any movement *in behalf of Christians* as a
proper motive, and sympathy for them was undoubtedly one of the
underlying reasons.

<span id="fn_3024"></span>[418:3025](2010345.htm#fr_3024.md) <span
id="iv.iii.i.iv-p20.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.i.iv-p21"></span> Constantine at Cibalis had 20,000
Licinius 35,000 (Anon. Vales. p. 473).

<span id="fn_3025"></span>[418:3026](2010345.htm#fr_3025.md) <span
id="iv.iii.i.iv-p21.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.i.iv-p22"></span> Zos. 2. 18; “by a sudden attack”
(Eutrop. 10. 4); “by night” (Vict. *Epit.* p. 50). Cf. Orosius, c. 28.

<span id="fn_3026"></span>[418:3027](2010345.htm#fr_3026.md) <span
id="iv.iii.i.iv-p22.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.i.iv-p23"></span> After the battle of Cibalis the
Greeks and the Macedonians, the inhabitants of the banks of the Danube,
of Achaia, and the whole nation of Illyrica became subject to
Constantine (Soz. 1. 6; cf. Anon. Vales. p. 474; Zos. 2. 20; Oros. c.
28, &c.).
