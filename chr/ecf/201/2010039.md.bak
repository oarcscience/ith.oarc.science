<span id="iii.vi.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.vi.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII.—</span>*The Disciples of our
Saviour.*

<span id="iii.vi.xii-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.vi.xii-p2.1"></span>The</span> names of the apostles of our
Saviour are known to every one from the Gospels. <span
id="fr_198"></span>[199](#fn_198.md) But there exists no catalogue of the
seventy disciples. <span id="fr_199"></span>[200](#fn_199.md) Barnabas,
indeed, is said to have been one of them, of whom the Acts of the
apostles makes mention in various places, <span
id="fr_200"></span>[201](#fn_200.md) <span id="page_99">p. 99</span> <span
id="iii.vi.xii-Page_99"></span>and especially Paul in his Epistle to the
Galatians. <span id="fr_201"></span>[202](#fn_201.md)

<span id="iii.vi.xii-p7"></span>2. They say that Sosthenes also, who
wrote to the Corinthians with Paul, was one of them. <span
id="fr_202"></span>[203](#fn_202.md) This is the account of Clement <span
id="fr_203"></span>[204](#fn_203.md) in the fifth book of his Hypotyposes,
in which he also says that Cephas was one of the seventy
disciples, <span id="fr_204"></span>[205](#fn_204.md) a man who bore the
same name as the apostle Peter, and the one concerning whom Paul says,
“When Cephas came to Antioch I withstood him to his face.” <span
id="fr_205"></span>[206](#fn_205.md)

<span id="iii.vi.xii-p12"></span>3. Matthias, <span
id="fr_206"></span>[207](#fn_206.md) also, who was numbered with the
apostles in the place of Judas, and the one who was honored by being
made a candidate with him, <span id="fr_207"></span>[208](#fn_207.md) are
likewise said to have been deemed worthy of the same calling with the
seventy. They say that Thaddeus <span id="fr_208"></span>[209](#fn_208.md)
also was one of them, concerning whom I shall presently relate an
account which has come down to us. <span
id="fr_209"></span>[210](#fn_209.md) And upon examination you will find
that our Saviour had more than seventy disciples, according to the
testimony of Paul, who says that after his resurrection from the dead he
appeared first to Cephas, then to the twelve, and after them to above
five hundred brethren at once, of whom some had fallen asleep; <span
id="fr_210"></span>[211](#fn_210.md) but the majority were still living at
the time he wrote.

<span id="iii.vi.xii-p18"></span>4. Afterwards he says he appeared unto
James, who was one of the so-called brethren of the Saviour. <span
id="fr_211"></span>[212](#fn_211.md) But, since in addition to these, there
were many others who were called apostles, in imitation of the Twelve,
as was Paul himself, he adds: “Afterward he appeared to all the
apostles.” <span id="fr_212"></span>[213](#fn_212.md) So much in regard to
these persons. But the story concerning Thaddeus is as follows.

*et passim*. Clement of Alexandria (*Strom.* II. 20) calls Barnabas one
of the Seventy. This tradition is not in itself improbable, but we can
trace it back no further than Clement. The Clementine *Recognitions* and
*Homilies* frequently mention Barnabas as an apostle active in
Alexandria and in Rome. One tradition sends him to Milan and makes him
the first bishop of the church there, but the silence of Ambrose in
regard to it is a sufficient proof of its groundlessness. There is
extant an apocryphal work, probably of the fifth century, entitled *Acta
et Passio Barnabæ in Cypro,* which relates his death by martyrdom in
Cyprus. The tradition may be true, but its existence has no weight.
Barnabas came from Cyprus and labored there for at least a time. It
would be natural, therefore, to assign his death (which was necessarily
martyrdom, for no Christian writer of the early centuries could have
admitted that he died a natural death) to that place.

<span id="iii.vi.xii-p8"></span> Sosthenes is mentioned in [1 Cor. i.
1](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#001.md)<span id="iii.vi.xii-p8.1"></span>.
From what source Eusebius drew this report in regard to him I cannot
tell. He is the first to mention it, so far as I know. A later tradition
reports that he became Bishop of Colophon, a city in Ionia. A Sosthenes
is mentioned also in [Acts xviii.
17](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#017.md)<span id="iii.vi.xii-p8.2"></span>,
as ruler of the Jewish synagogue in Corinth. Some wish to identify the
two, supposing the latter to have been afterward converted, but in this
case of course he cannot have been one of the Seventy. Eusebius’
tradition is one in regard to whose value we can form no opinion.

id="iii.vi.xii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.xii-p10"></span> Clement is, so far as I know, the
first to make this distinction between Peter the Apostle, and Cephas,
one of the Seventy. The reason for the invention of a second Peter in
the post-apostolic age is easy to understand as resulting from the
desire to do away with the conflict between two apostles. This Cephas
appears frequently in later traditions and is commemorated in the
Menology of Basil on December 9, and in the Armenian calendar on
September 25. In the *Ecclesiastical Canons* he is made one of the
twelve apostles, and distinguished from Peter.

id="iii.vi.xii-p12.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.xii-p13"></span> We learn from [Acts i.
21](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#021.md)<span id="iii.vi.xii-p13.1"></span>
sqq. that Matthias was a follower of Christ throughout his ministry and
therefore the tradition, which Eusebius is, so far as we know, the first
to record, is not at all improbable. Epiphanius (at the close of the
first book of his *Hær.,* Dindorf’s ed. I. p. 337) a half-century later
records the same tradition. Nicephorus Callistus (II. 40) says that he
labored and suffered martyrdom in Ethiopia (probably meaning Caucasian
Ethiopia, east of the Black Sea). Upon the *Gospel of Matthias* see
below, III. 25, note 30.

<span id="fn_207"></span>[99:208](2010039.htm#fr_207.md) <span
id="iii.vi.xii-p13.2"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.xii-p14"></span> Joseph Barsabas, surnamed Justus. He,
too, had been with Christ from the beginning, and therefore may well
have been one of the Seventy, as Eusebius reports. Papias (quoted by
Eusebius, III. 39, below) calls him Justus Barsabas, and relates that he
drank a deadly poison without experiencing any injury.

<span id="fn_208"></span>[99:209](2010039.htm#fr_208.md) <span
id="iii.vi.xii-p14.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.xii-p15"></span> From a comparison of the different
lists of apostles given by Matthew, Mark, and Luke, Thaddeus is seen to
be one of the Twelve, apparently identical with Jude and Lebbæus
(compare Jerome, *In Matt.* X.). Eusebius here sunders him from the
apostles and makes him one of the Seventy, committing an error similar
to that which arose in the case of Peter and Cephas. He perhaps records
only an oral tradition, as he uses the word <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vi.xii-p15.1"></span>φασί</span>. He is, so far as is known, the
first to mention the tradition.

id="iii.vi.xii-p18.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.xii-p19"></span> The relationship of James and Jesus
has always been a disputed matter. Three theories have been advanced,
and are all widely represented.

<span id="iii.vi.xii-p20"></span>The first is the full-brother
hypothesis, according to which the brothers and sisters of Jesus were
children of both Joseph and Mary. This was advocated strongly by the
heretic Helvidius in Rome in 380, and is widely accepted in the
Protestant Church. The only serious objection to it is the committal of
Mary to the care of John by Christ upon the cross. But John was at any
rate an own cousin of Jesus, and the objection loses its weight when we
realize the spiritual sympathy which existed between Jesus and John, and
the lack of belief exhibited by his own brothers. The second is the
half-brother hypothesis which regards the brethren and sisters of Jesus
as children of Joseph by a former wife. This has the oldest tradition in
its favor (though the tradition for none of the theories is old or
universal enough to be of great weight), the apocryphal *Gospel of
James,* chap. ix., recording that Joseph was a widower and had children
before marrying Mary. It is still the established theory in the Greek
Church. The greatest objection to it is that if it be true, Christ as a
younger son of Joseph, could not have been regarded as the heir to the
throne of David. That the objection is absolutely fatal cannot be
asserted for it is nowhere clearly stated that he was the heir-apparent
to the throne; it is said only that he was of the line of David. Both of
these theories agree in distinguishing James, the brother of the Lord,
from James, the son of Alphæus, the apostle, and thus assume at least
three Jameses in the New Testament. Over against both of them is to be
mentioned a third, which assumes only two Jameses, regarding the
brethren of the Lord as his cousins, and identifying them with the sons
of Alphæus. This theory originated with Jerome in 383 <span
class="c13"><span id="iii.vi.xii-p20.1"></span>a.d.</span> with the
confessedly dogmatic object of preserving the virginity both of Mary and
of Joseph in opposition to Helvidius. Since his time it has been the
established theory in the Latin Church, and is advocated also by many
Protestant scholars. The original and common form of the theory makes
Jesus and James maternal cousins: finding only three women in [John xix.
25](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#025.md)<span id="iii.vi.xii-p20.2"></span>,
and regarding Mary, the wife of Clopas, as the sister of the Virgin
Mary. But this is in itself improbable and rests upon poor exegesis. It
is far better to assume that four women are mentioned in this passage. A
second form of the cousin theory, which regards Jesus and James as
paternal cousins—making Alphæus (Clopas) the brother of
Joseph—originated with Lange. It is very ingenious, and urges in its
support the authority of Hegesippus, who, according to Eusebius (*H. E.*
III. 11), says that Clopas was the brother of Joseph and the father of
Simeon, which would make the latter the brother of James, and thus just
as truly the brother of the Lord as he. But Hegesippus plainly thinks of
James and of Simeon as standing in different relations to Christ,—the
former his brother, the latter his cousin,—and therefore his testimony
is against, rather than for Lange’s hypothesis. The statement of
Hegesippus, indeed, expresses the cousinship of Christ with James the
Little, the son of Clopas (if Alphæus and Clopas be identified), but
does not identify this cousin with James the brother of the Lord.
Eusebius also is claimed by Lange as a witness to his theory, but his
exegesis of the passage to which he appeals is poor (see below, Bk. IV.
chap. 22 note 4). Against both forms of the cousin theory may be urged
the natural meaning of the word <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vi.xii-p20.3"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vi.xii-p20.4"></span>δελφός</span>, and also the statement of
[John vii. 5](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#005.md)<span
id="iii.vi.xii-p20.5"></span>, “Neither did his brethren believe in
him,” which makes it impossible to suppose that his brothers were
apostles. From this fatal objection both of the brother hypotheses are
free, and either of them is possible, but the former rests upon a more
natural interpretation of the various passages involved, and would
perhaps have been universally accepted had it not been for the dogmatic
interest felt by the early Church in preserving the virginity of Mary.
Renan’s complicated theory (see his *Les Evangiles,* p. 537 sqq.) does
not help matters at all, and need not be discussed here. There is much
to be said, however, in favor of the separation of Alphæus and Clopas,
upon which he insists and which involves the existence of four Jameses
instead of only three.

<span id="iii.vi.xii-p21"></span>For a fuller discussion of this whole
subject, see Andrews (*Life of our Lord*, pp. 104–116), Schaff (*Church
Hist.* I. 272–275), and Weiss (*Einleitung in das N. T.* p. 388 sqq.),
all of whom defend the natural brother hypothesis; Lightfoot (Excursus
upon “The Brethren of the Lord” in his *Commentary on Galatians*, 2d ed.
p. 247–282), who is the strongest advocate of the half-brother theory;
Mill (*The Accounts of our Lord’s Brethren in the N. T. vindicated,*
Cambridge, 1843), who maintains the maternal cousin theory; and Lange
(in *Herzog*), who presents the paternal cousin hypothesis. Compare
finally Holtzmann’s article in the *Zeitschrift für Wiss. Theologie*,
1880, p. 198 sqq.
