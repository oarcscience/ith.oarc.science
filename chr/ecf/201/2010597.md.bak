Persecutors; and on the Captivity of Valerian.*

<span id="iv.vi.iv.xi-p2"></span>“<span class="c13"><span

that I err in acknowledging this one God, the author and parent of all
things: whom many of my predecessors in power, led astray by the madness
of error, have ventured to deny, but who were all visited with a
retribution so terrible and so destructive, that all succeeding
generations have held up their calamities as the most effectual warning
to any who desire to follow in their steps. Of the number of these I
believe him <span id="fr_3315"></span>[3316](#fn_3315.md) to have been,
whom the lightning-stroke of Divine vengeance drove forth from hence,
and banished to your dominions and whose disgrace contributed to the
fame of your celebrated triumph.
