<span id="iv.vi.iii.li-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.li-p1.1"></span>Chapter LI</span>.—*That he ordered a
Church to be built at Mambre.*

<span id="iv.vi.iii.li-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.li-p2.1"></span>Such</span> was the principal sacred
edifices erected by the emperor’s command. But having heard that the
self-same Saviour who erewhile had appeared on earth <span
id="fr_3283"></span>[3284](#fn_3283) had in ages long since past
afforded a manifestation of his Divine presence to holy men of Palestine
near the oak of Mambre, <span id="fr_3284"></span>[3285](#fn_3284) he
ordered that a house of prayer should be built there also in honor of
the God who had thus appeared. Accordingly the imperial commission was
transmitted to the provincial governors by letters addressed to them
individually, enjoining a speedy completion of the appointed work. He
sent moreover to the writer of this history an eloquent admonition, a
copy of which I think it well to insert in the present work, in order to
convey a just idea of his pious diligence and zeal. To express, then,
his displeasure at the evil practices which he had heard were usual in
the place just referred to, he addressed me in the following terms.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.li-p3"></span> This doctrine, which appears again
and again in Eusebius and in Constantine, has a curiously interesting
bearing at present theological controversies in America, and England for
that matter. It may be called the doctrine of the “eternal Christ,” as
over against the doctrine of the “essential Christ,” or that which seems
to make his existence begin with his incarnation—the “historical
Christ.” He had historical existence from the beginning, both as the
indwelling and as the objective, and one might venture to think that
advocates of these two views could find a meeting-ground, or solution of
difficulty at least, in this phrase which represents him who was in the
beginning with God and is and ever shall be, who has made all things
which have been made, and is in all parts of the universe and the world,
among Jews and Gentiles.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.li-p4"></span> \[The English version in this passage
([Gen. xviii. 1](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#001)<span
id="iv.vi.iii.li-p4.1"></span>), and others, has “plains,” though the
Septuagint and ancient interpreters generally render it, as here, by
“oak,” some by “terebinth” (turpentine tree), the Vulgate by
“convallis.”—*Bag.*\] The Revised Version (1881–1885) has “oaks.”
