id="iv.vi.iv.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIV</span>.—*How the Zealous
Prayers of Constantine procured Peace to the Christians.*

<span id="iv.vi.iv.xiv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.xiv-p2.1"></span>Thus</span>, the nations of the world
being everywhere guided in their course as it were by the skill of a
single pilot, and acquiescing in the administration of him who governed
as the servant of God, the peace of the Roman empire continued
undisturbed, and all classes of his subjects enjoyed a life of
tranquillity and repose. At the same time the emperor, who was convinced
that the prayers of godly men contributed powerfully to the maintenance
of the public welfare, felt himself constrained zealously to seek such
prayers and not only himself implored the help and favor of God, but
charged the prelates of the churches to offer supplications on his
behalf.
