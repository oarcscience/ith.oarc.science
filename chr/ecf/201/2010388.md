<span id="iv.vi.i.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter III</span>.—*How God honors Pious
Princes, but destroys Tyrants.*

<span id="iv.vi.i.iii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.iii-p2.1"></span>Having</span> given assurance that those
who glorify and honor him will meet with an abundant recompense at his
hands, while those who set themselves against him as enemies and
adversaries will compass the ruin of their own souls, he has already
established the truth of these his own declarations, having shown on the
one hand the fearful end of those tyrants who denied and opposed
him, <span id="fr_3057"></span>[3058](#fn_3057) and at the same time
having made it manifest that even the death of his servant, as well as
his life, is worthy of admiration and praise, and justly claims the
memorial, not merely of perishable, but of immortal monuments.

<span id="iv.vi.i.iii-p4"></span>Mankind, devising some consolation for
the frail and precarious duration of human life, have thought by the
erection of monuments to glorify the memories of their ancestors with
immortal honors. Some have employed the vivid delineations and colors of
painting <span id="fr_3058"></span>[3059](#fn_3058) ; some have carved
statues from lifeless blocks of wood; while others, by engraving their
inscriptions deep on tablets <span id="fr_3059"></span>[3060](#fn_3059)
and monuments, have thought to transmit the virtues of those whom they
honored to perpetual remembrance. All these indeed are perishable, and
consumed by the lapse of time, being representations of the corruptible
body, and not expressing the image of the immortal soul. And yet these
seemed sufficient to those who had no well-grounded hope of happiness
after the termination of this mortal life. But God, that God, I say, who
is the common Saviour of all, having treasured up with himself, for
those who love godliness, greater blessings than human thought has
conceived, gives the earnest and first-fruits of future rewards even
here, assuring in some sort immortal hopes to mortal eyes. The ancient
oracles of the prophets, delivered to us in the Scripture, declare this;
the lives of pious men, who shone in old time with every virtue, bear
witness to posterity of the same; and our own days prove it to be true,
wherein Constantine, who alone of all that ever wielded the Roman power
was the friend of God the Sovereign of all, has appeared to all mankind
so clear an example of a godly life.
