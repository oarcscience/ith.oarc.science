<span id="iv.vi.iii.lix-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.lix-p1.1"></span>Chapter LIX</span>.—*Of the Disturbance
at Antioch by Eustathius.*

<span id="iv.vi.iii.lix-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.lix-p2.1"></span>In</span> the midst, however, of the
general happiness occasioned by these events, and while the Church of
God was every where and every way flourishing throughout the empire,
once more that spirit of envy, who ever watches for the ruin of the
good, prepared himself to combat the greatness of our prosperity, in the
expectation, perhaps, that the emperor himself, provoked by our tumults
and disorders, might eventually become estranged from us. Accordingly,
he kindled a furious controversy at Antioch, and thereby involved the
church in that place in a series of tragic calamities, which had
well-nigh occasioned the total overthrow of the city. The members of the
Church were divided into two opposite parties; while the people,
including even the magistrates and soldiery, were roused to such a
pitch, that the contest would have been decided by the sword, had not
the watchful providence of God, as well as dread of the emperor’s
displeasure, controlled the fury of the multitude. On this occasion,
too, the emperor, acting the part of a preserver and physician of souls,
applied with much forbearance the remedy of persuasion to those who
needed it. He gently pleaded, as it were by an embassy, with his people,
sending among them one of the best approved and most faithful of those
who were honored with the dignity of Count; <span
id="fr_3293"></span>[3294](#fn_3293.md) at the same time that he exhorted
them to a peaceable spirit by repeated letters, and instructed them in
the practice of true godliness. Having prevailed by these remonstrances,
he excused their conduct in his subsequent letters, alleging that he had
himself heard the merits of the case from him on whose account the
disturbance had arisen. <span id="fr_3294"></span>[3295](#fn_3294.md) And
these letters of his, which are replete with learning and instruction of
no ordinary kind, I should have inserted in this present work, were it
not that they might affix a mark of dishonor to the character of the
persons accused. I will therefore omit these, being unwilling to revive
the memory of past grievances, and will only annex those to my present
narrative which he wrote to testify his satisfaction at the
re-establishment of peace and concord among the rest. In these letters,
he cautioned them against any desire to claim the ruler of another
district, <span id="fr_3295"></span>[3296](#fn_3295.md) through whose
intervention peace had been restored, as their own, and exhorted them,
consistently with the usage of the Church, to choose him as their
bishop, whom the common Saviour of all should point out as suited for
the office. His letter, then, is addressed to the people and to the
bishops, severally, in the following terms.

whose deposition, on the ground of a charge of immorality, by the
partisans of Eusebius of Nicomedia, had occasioned the disturbances
alluded to in the text.—*Bag.*\] There is a view that this whole trouble
was the result of an intrigue of Eusebius to get the better of
Eustathius, who was in a sense a rival. Compare for very vigorous
expression of this view, Venables, *Eustathius of Antioch,* in Smith and
Wace, *Dict.*

paraphrase of *Molz.* may be better, “no foreign bishops.”
