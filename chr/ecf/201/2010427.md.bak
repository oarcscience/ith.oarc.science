upon Bishops, and the Building of Churches.*

<span id="iv.vi.i.xlii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.xlii-p2.1"></span>The</span> emperor also personally
inviting the society of God’s ministers, distinguished them with the
highest possible respect and honor, showing them favor in deed and word
as persons consecrated to the service of his God. Accordingly, they were
admitted to his table, though mean in their attire and outward
appearance; yet not so in his estimation, since he thought he saw not
the man as seen by the vulgar eye, but the God in him. He made them also
his companions in travel, believing that He whose servants they were
would thus help him. Besides this, he gave from his own private
resources costly benefactions to the churches of God, both enlarging and
heightening the sacred edifices, <span

sanctuaries <span id="fr_3138"></span>[3139](#fn_3138.md) of the church
with abundant offerings.

<span id="iv.vi.i.xlii-p4"></span> Variously rendered, but seems to say
that the smaller buildings were enlarged and the larger ones enriched.
The number of buildings which Constantine is claimed to have erected in
Rome alone is prodigious. One meets at every turn in the modern city
churches which were, it is said, founded or remodeled by him. For
interesting monograph which claims to have established the Constantinian
foundation of many of these, see <span class="c13"><span

*Literature.*
