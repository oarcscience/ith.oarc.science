<span id="iii.xii.xxx-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xii.xxx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIX</span>.—*Paul, having been
refuted by Malchion, a Presbyter from the Sophists, was excommunicated.*

<span id="iii.xii.xxx-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xii.xxx-p2.1"></span>During</span> his reign a final synod <span
id="fr_2392"></span>[2393](#fn_2392.md) composed of a great many bishops
was held, and the leader of heresy <span
id="fr_2393"></span>[2394](#fn_2393.md) in Antioch was detected, and his
false doctrine clearly shown before all, and he was excommunicated from
the Catholic Church under heaven. <span

<span id="iii.xii.xxx-p7"></span>2. Malchion especially drew him out of
his hiding-place and refuted him. He was a man learned in other
respects, and principal of the sophist school of Grecian learning in
Antioch; yet on account of the superior nobility of his faith in Christ
he had been made a presbyter of that parish. This man, having conducted
a discussion with him, which was taken down by stenographers and which
we know is still extant, was alone able to detect the man who dissembled
and deceived the others.

<span id="iii.xii.xxx-p3"></span> Eusebius puts this council in the
reign of Aurelian (270–275), and in chap. 32 makes it subsequent to the
siege of the Brucheium which, according to his *Chron.,* took place in
272. The epistle written at this council (and given in the next chapter)
is addressed to Maximus, bishop of Alexandria, and Dionysius, bishop of
Rome, so that the latter must have been alive in 272, if the council was
held as late as that. The council is ordinarily, however, assigned to
the year 269, and Dionysius’ death to December of the same year; but
Lipsius has shown (*ibid.* p. 226 ff.) that the synod which Eusebius
mentions here was held in all probability as early as 265 (but not
earlier than 264, because Dionysius of Alexandria was not succeeded by
Maximus until that year), certainly not later than 268, and hence it is
not necessary to extend the episcopate of Dionysius of Rome beyond 268,
the date which he has shown to be most probable (see chap. 27, note 2).
Eusebius then is entirely mistaken in putting the council into the reign
of Aurelian.

<span id="iii.xii.xxx-p5"></span> Malchion gained such fame from his
controversy with Paul that an account of him is given by Jerome in his
*de vir. ill.* 71. He tells us, however, nothing new about him, except
that he was the author of an epistle to the bishops of Alexandria and
Rome, referring probably to the encyclical letter given in the next
chapter. We do not know upon what authority he bases this statement; in
fact knowing the character of his work, we shall probably be safe in
assuming that the statement is no more than a guess on his part. There
is nothing improbable in the report, but we must remember that Jerome is
our only authority for it, and he is in such a case very poor authority
(nevertheless, in Fremantle’s articles, *Malchion,* in the *Dict. of
Christ. Biog.,* the report is repeated as a fact). Both Eusebius and
Jerome tell us that the report of his discussion with Paul was extant in
their day, and a few fragments of it have been preserved, and are given
by Leontius (*de Sectis,* III. p. 504, according to Fremantle).

ἐκκλησίας, i.e., “from the *entire* Catholic Church.” The phrase is
usually strengthened by a πᾶς, as in the next chapter, § 2. On the use
of the phrase, “Catholic Church,” see Bk. IV. chap. 15, note 6.
