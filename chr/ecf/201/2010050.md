<span id="iii.vii.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.vii.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—</span>*The Famine which took
Place in the Reign of Claudius.*

<span id="iii.vii.ix-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.vii.ix-p2.1"></span>Caius</span> had held the power not quite
four years, <span id="fr_324"></span>[325](#fn_324) when he was
succeeded by the emperor Claudius. Under him the world was visited with
a famine, <span id="fr_325"></span>[326](#fn_325) which writers that are
entire strangers to our religion have recorded in their histories. <span
id="fr_326"></span>[327](#fn_326) And thus the prediction of Agabus
recorded in the Acts of the Apostles, <span
id="fr_327"></span>[328](#fn_327) according to which the whole world was
to be visited by a famine, received its fulfillment.

<span id="iii.vii.ix-p7"></span>2. And Luke, in the Acts, after
mentioning the famine in the time of Claudius, and stating that the
brethren of Antioch, each according to his ability, sent to the brethren
of Judea by the hands of Paul and Barnabas, <span
id="fr_328"></span>[329](#fn_328) adds the following account.

<span id="iii.vii.ix-p3"></span> Caius ruled from March 16, <span
class="c13"><span id="iii.vii.ix-p3.1"></span>a.d.</span> 37, to Jan.
24, <span class="c13"><span id="iii.vii.ix-p3.2"></span>a.d.</span> 41,
and was succeeded by his uncle Claudius.

<span id="fn_325"></span>[110:326](2010050.htm#fr_325) <span
id="iii.vii.ix-p3.3"></span>

<span id="iii.vii.ix-p4"></span> Several famines occurred during the
reign of Claudius (cf. Dion Cassius, LX. 11, Tacitus, *Annal.* XII. 13,
and Eusebius, *Chron.,* year of Abr. 2070) in different parts of the
empire, but no universal famine is recorded such as Eusebius speaks of.
According to Josephus (*Ant.* XX. 2.5 and 5. 2), a severe famine took
place in Judea while Cuspius Fadus and Tiberius Alexander were
successively procurators. Fadus was sent into Judea upon the death of
Agrippa (44 <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.vii.ix-p4.1"></span>a.d.</span>), and Alexander was succeeded by
Cumanus in 48 <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.vii.ix-p4.2"></span>a.d.</span> The exact date of Alexander’s
accession we do not know, but it took place probably about 45 or 46.
This famine is without doubt the one referred to by Agabus in <span
id="iii.vii.ix-p4.3"></span>[Acts xi.
28](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#028)<span id="iii.vii.ix-p4.4"></span>.
The exact meaning of the word <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vii.ix-p4.5"></span>οἰκουμένη</span>, in that passage, is a
matter of dispute. Whether it refers simply to Palestine, or is used to
indicate a succession of famines in different parts of the world, or is
employed only in a rhetorical sense, it is impossible to say. Eusebius
understands the word in its widest sense, and therefore assumes a
universal famine; but he is mistaken in his assumption.

id="iii.vii.ix-p4.6"></span>

<span id="iii.vii.ix-p5"></span> The only non-Christian historians, so
far as we know, to record a famine during the reign of Claudius, are
Dion Cassius and Tacitus, who mention a famine in Rome, and Josephus,
who speaks of the famine in Judea (see the previous note for the
references). Eusebius, in his *Chron.,* mentions famines both in Greece
and in Rome during this reign, but upon what authority we do not know.
As already remarked, we have no extant account of a general famine at
this time.
