id="iv.vi.iv.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIII</span>.—*How he forbade
Idolatrous Worship, but honored Martyrs and the Church Festivals.*

<span id="iv.vi.iv.xxiii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.xxiii-p2.1"></span>Such</span> were his sacred
ministrations in the service of his God. At the same time, his subjects,
both civil and military, throughout the empire, found a barrier
everywhere opposed against idol worship, and every kind of sacrifice
forbidden. <span id="fr_3321"></span>[3322](#fn_3321.md) A statute was also
passed, enjoining the due observance of the Lord’s day, and transmitted
to the governors of every province, who undertook, at the emperor’s
command, to respect the days commemorative of martyrs, and duly to honor
the festal seasons in the churches: <span
id="fr_3322"></span>[3323](#fn_3322.md) and all these intentions were
fullfilled to the emperor’s entire satisfaction.

honored the festal days by public gatherings,’ while *Val*. \[and
