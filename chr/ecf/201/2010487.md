id="iv.vi.ii.xlii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLII</span>.—*An Earnest
Exhortation to worship God.*

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xlii-p2"></span>“<span class="c13"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.xlii-p2.1"></span>And</span> now, since it appears by the
clearest and most convincing evidence, that the miseries which erewhile
oppressed the entire human race are now banished from every part of the
world, through the power of Almighty God, and at the same time the
counsel and aid which he is pleased on many occasions to administer
through our agency; it remains for all, both individually and unitedly,
to observe and seriously consider how great this power and how
efficacious this grace are, which have annihilated and utterly destroyed
this generation, as I may call them, of most wicked and evil men; have
restored joy to the good, and diffused it over all countries; and now
guarantee the fullest authority both to honor the Divine law as it
should be honored, with all reverence, and pay due observance to those
who have dedicated themselves to the service of that law. These rising
as from some dark abyss and, with an enlightened knowledge of the
present course of events, will henceforward render to its precepts that
becoming reverence and honor which are consistent with their pious
character.
