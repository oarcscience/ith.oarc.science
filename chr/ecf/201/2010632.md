<span id="iv.vi.iv.xlvi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.xlvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLVI</span>.—*That Eusebius
afterwards delivered his Description of the Church of the Saviour, and a
Tricennial Oration before Constantine himself.*

<span id="iv.vi.iv.xlvi-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.xlvi-p2.1"></span>The</span> structure of the church of our
Saviour, the form of his sacred cave, the splendor of the work itself,
and the numberless offerings in gold, and silver, and precious stones, I
have described to the best of my ability, and dedicated to the emperor
in a separate treatise, which on a fitting opportunity I shall append to
this present work. I shall add to it also that oration on his
Tricennalia which shortly afterwards, having traveled to the city which
bears his name, I delivered in the emperor’s own presence. <span
id="fr_3343"></span>[3344](#fn_3343.md) This was the second opportunity
afforded me of glorifying the Supreme God in the imperial palace itself:
and on this occasion my pious hearer evinced the greatest joy, as he
afterwards testified, when he entertained the bishops then present, and
loaded them with distinctions of every kind.
