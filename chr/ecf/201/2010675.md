<span id="iv.vii.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vii.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIII</span>.—*That there is a
Necessary Difference between Created Things. That the Propensity to Good
and Evil depends on the Will of Man; and that, consequently, Judgment is
a Necessary and Reasonable Thing.*

<span id="iv.vii.xiii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vii.xiii-p2.1"></span>There</span> are, indeed, some who venture
with childish presumption to find fault with God in respect of this
also, and ask why it is that he has not created one and the same natural
disposition for all, but rather has ordained the existence of many
things different, nay, contrary in their nature, whence arises the
dissimilarity of our moral conduct and character. Would it not (say
they) have been better, both as regards obedience to the commands of
God, and a just apprehension of himself, and for the confirmation of
individual faith, that all mankind should be of the same moral
character? It is indeed ridiculous to expect that this could be the
case, and to forget that the constitution of the world is different from
that of the things that are in the world; that physical and moral
objects are not identical in their nature, nor the affections of the
body the same as those of the soul. \[For the immortal soul far exceeds
the material world in dignity, and is more blessed than the perishable
and terrestrial creation, in proportion as it is noble and more allied
to God. <span id="fr_3437"></span>[3438](#fn_3437.md) \] Nor is the human
race excluded from participation in the divine goodness; though this is
not the lot of all indiscriminately, but of those only who search deeply
into the Divine nature, and propose the knowledge of sacred things as
the leading object of their lives.

defective. The conjectural restoration of Valesius, which seems
probable, is chiefly followed.—*Bag.*\] Heinichen, like Christophorson
