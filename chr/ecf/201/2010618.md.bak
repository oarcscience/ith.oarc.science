<span id="iv.vi.iv.xxxii-p3"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.xxxii-p3.1"></span>The</span> emperor was in the habit of
composing his orations in the Latin tongue, from which they were
translated into Greek by interpreters appointed for this special
service. One of the discourses thus translated I intend to annex, by way
of specimen, to this present work, that one, I mean, which he inscribed
“To the assembly of the saints,” and dedicated to the Church of God,
that no one may have ground for deeming my testimony on this head mere
empty praise.
