id="iii.xiv.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter X.</span>

<span id="iii.xiv.xi-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xiv.xi-p2.1"></span>On</span> the fourteenth day of the
following month Appellæus, <span id="fr_2672"></span>[2673](#fn_2672.md)
the nineteenth before the Kalends of January, certain persons from Egypt
were again seized by those who examined people passing the gates. They
had been sent to minister to the confessors in Cilicia. They received
the same sentence as those whom they had gone to help, being mutilated
in their eyes and feet. Three of them exhibited in Ascalon, where they
were imprisoned, marvelous bravery in the endurance of various kinds of
martyrdom. One of them named Ares was condemned to the flames, and the
others, called Probus <span id="fr_2673"></span>[2674](#fn_2673.md) and
Elias, were beheaded.

<span id="iii.xiv.xi-p5"></span>2. On the eleventh day of the month
Audynæus, <span id="fr_2674"></span>[2675](#fn_2674.md) which is the third
before the Ides of January, in the same city of Cæsarea, Peter an
ascetic, also called Apselamus, <span
id="fr_2675"></span>[2676](#fn_2675.md) from the village of Anea, <span
id="fr_2676"></span>[2677](#fn_2676.md) on the borders of Eleutheropolis,
like purest gold, gave noble proof by fire of his faith in the Christ of
God. Though the judge and those around him besought him many times to
have compassion on himself, and to spare his own youth and bloom, he
disregarded them, preferring hope in the God of the universe to all
things, even to life itself. A certain Asclepius, supposed to be <span
id="fr_2677"></span>[2678](#fn_2677.md) a bishop of the sect of Marcion,
possessed as he thought with zeal for religion, but “not according to
knowledge,” <span id="fr_2678"></span>[2679](#fn_2678.md) ended his life on
one and the same funeral pyre. These things took place in this manner.

<span id="iii.xiv.xi-p3"></span> i.e. Dec. 14, 308 (see the tables on p.
403, below).

<span id="iii.xiv.xi-p4"></span> The majority of the codices read <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.xiv.xi-p4.1"></span>Πρόμος</span>, but as
Valesius remarks, such a proper name is quite unknown in Greek, and the
form probably arose from a confusion of <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xiv.xi-p4.2"></span>β</span> and <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xiv.xi-p4.3"></span>μ</span>, which in ancient <span
class="c13"><span id="iii.xiv.xi-p4.4"></span>mss.</span> were written
alike. Two of our existing codices read <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xiv.xi-p4.5"></span>Πρόβος</span>, and this has been adopted by
Zimmermann and Heinichen, whom I have followed in the text.

<span id="iii.xiv.xi-p8"></span> Of this village we know nothing, but
Eleutheropolis (originally Bethozabris) was an important place lying
some forty miles southwest of Jerusalem.

<span id="iii.xiv.xi-p9"></span> <span class="Greek"><span

admit that he was a bishop in a true sense.
