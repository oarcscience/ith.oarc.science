id="iv.vi.iii.xxxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXII</span>.—*That he
instructed the Governors concerning the Beautifying of the Roof; also
concerning Workmen, and Materials.*

<span id="iv.vi.iii.xxxii-p2"></span>“<span class="c13"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.xxxii-p2.1"></span>With</span> respect to the
ceiling <span id="fr_3263"></span>[3264](#fn_3263.md) of the church, <span
id="page_529">p. 529</span> <span id="iv.vi.iii.xxxii-Page_529"></span>I
wish to know from you whether in your judgment it should be
panel-ceiled, <span id="fr_3264"></span>[3265](#fn_3264.md) or finished
with any other kind of workmanship. If the panel ceiling be adopted, it
may also be ornamented with gold. For the rest, your Holiness will give
information as early as possible to the before-mentioned magistrates how
many laborers and artificers, and what expenditure of money is required.
You will also be careful to send us a report without delay, not only
respecting the marbles and columns, but the paneled ceiling also, should
this appear to you to be the most beautiful form. God preserve you,
beloved brother!”

<span id="iv.vi.iii.xxxii-p3"></span> The word used is the technical
“camera,” meaning properly a certain style of vaulted ceiling, but here
it is perhaps the generic ceiling if the specific word below means panel
ceiling.

<span id="fn_3264"></span>[529:3265](2010551.htm#fr_3264.md) <span
id="iv.vi.iii.xxxii-p3.1"></span>

<span id="iv.vi.iii.xxxii-p4"></span> This is the word for the Lacunaria
or panel ceilings, a style of ceiling where “planks were placed across
these beams at certain intervals leaving hollow spaces” “which were
frequently covered with gold and ivory and sometimes with paintings.”
Compare article *Domus,* in Smith, *Dict. Gr. and Rom. Ant.* The passage
may mean either “with respect to the ceiling…whether…wainscoted” or
“with respect to the Camera…whether panel ceiled.”
