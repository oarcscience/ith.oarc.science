<span id="iii.vii.iv-p1"></span> <span id="page_107">p. 107</span> <span
id="iii.vii.iv-Page_107"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.vii.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter III.—</span>*The Doctrine of Christ
soon spread throughout All the World.*

<span id="iii.vii.iv-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.vii.iv-p2.1"></span>Thus</span>, under the influence of heavenly
power, and with the divine co-operation, the doctrine of the Saviour,
like the rays of the sun, quickly illumined the whole world; <span
id="fr_282"></span>[283](#fn_282.md) and straightway, in accordance with
the divine Scriptures, <span id="fr_283"></span>[284](#fn_283.md) the voice
of the inspired evangelists and apostles went forth through all the
earth, and their words to the end of the world.

<span id="iii.vii.iv-p5"></span>2. In every city and village, churches
were quickly established, filled with multitudes of people like a
replenished threshing-floor. And those whose minds, in consequence of
errors which had descended to them from their forefathers, were fettered
by the ancient disease of idolatrous superstition, were, by the power of
Christ operating through the teaching and the wonderful works of his
disciples, set free, as it were, from terrible masters, and found a
release from the most cruel bondage. They renounced with abhorrence
every species of demoniacal polytheism, and confessed that there was
only one God, the creator of all things, and him they honored with the
rites of true piety, through the inspired and rational worship which has
been planted by our Saviour among men.

<span id="iii.vii.iv-p6"></span>3. But the divine grace being now poured
out upon the rest of the nations, Cornelius, of Cæsarea in Palestine,
with his whole house, through a divine revelation and the agency of
Peter, first received faith in Christ; <span
id="fr_284"></span>[285](#fn_284.md) and after him a multitude of other
Greeks in Antioch, <span id="fr_285"></span>[286](#fn_285.md) to whom those
who were scattered by the persecution of Stephen had preached the
Gospel. When the church of Antioch was now increasing and abounding, and
a multitude of prophets from Jerusalem were on the ground, <span
id="fr_286"></span>[287](#fn_286.md) among them Barnabas and Paul and in
addition many other brethren, the name of Christians first sprang up
there, <span id="fr_287"></span>[288](#fn_287.md) as from a fresh and
life-giving fountain. <span id="fr_288"></span>[289](#fn_288.md)

<span id="iii.vii.iv-p12"></span>4. And Agabus, one of the prophets who
was with them, uttered a prophecy concerning the famine which was about
to take place, <span id="fr_289"></span>[290](#fn_289.md) and Paul and
Barnabas were sent to relieve the necessities of the brethren. <span
id="fr_290"></span>[291](#fn_290.md)

That Christianity had already spread over the whole world at this time
is, of course, an exaggeration; but the statement is not a mere
rhetorical flourish; it was believed as a historical fact. This
conception arose originally out of the idea that the second coming of
Christ was near, and the whole world must know of him before his coming.
The tradition that the apostles preached in all parts of the world is to
be traced back to the same cause.

The Textus Receptus of the New Testament reads at this point ῾<span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.vii.iv-p8.2"></span>Ελληνιστ€ς</span>, a
reading which is strongly supported by external testimony and adopted by
Westcott and Hort. But the internal evidence seems to demand ῞<span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.vii.iv-p8.3"></span>Ελληνας</span>, and this
reading is found in some of the oldest versions and in a few <span
class="c13"><span id="iii.vii.iv-p8.4"></span>mss.</span>, and is
adopted by most modern critics, including Tischendorf. Eusebius is a
witness for the latter reading. He takes the word <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.vii.iv-p8.5"></span>῞</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.vii.iv-p8.6"></span>Ελληνας</span> in a
broad sense to indicate all that are not Jews, as is clear from his
insertion of the <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vii.iv-p8.7"></span>ἄ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vii.iv-p8.8"></span>λλων</span>, “*other* Greeks,” after
speaking of Cornelius, who was not a Greek, but a Roman. Closs
accordingly translates *Nichtjuden,* and Stigloher *Heiden.*

This name was first given to the disciples by the heathen of Antioch,
not by the Jews, to whom the word “Christ” meant too much; nor by the
disciples themselves, for the word seldom appears in the New Testament,
and nowhere in the mouth of a disciple. The word <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.vii.iv-p10.2"></span>χριστιανός</span> has a
Latin termination, but this does not prove that it was invented by
Romans, for Latinisms were common in the Greek of that day. It was
probably originally given as a term of contempt, but accepted by the
disciples as a term of the highest honor.

Agabus is known to us only from this and one other passage of the [Acts
21.10](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#010.md)<span
id="iii.vii.iv-p13.2"></span>, where he foretells the imprisonment of
Paul. The famine here referred to took place in the reign of Claudius,
where Eusebius puts it when he mentions it again in chap. 8. He cannot
therefore be accused, as many accuse him, of putting the famine itself
into the reign of Tiberius, and hence of committing a chronological
error. He is following the account of the Acts, and mentions the
prominent fact of the famine in that connection, without thinking of
chronological order. His method is, to be sure, loose, as he does not
inform his readers that he is anticipating by a number of years, but
leaves them to discover it for themselves when they find the same
subject taken up again after a digression of four chapters. Upon the
famine itself, see below, chap. 8.
