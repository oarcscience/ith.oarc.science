<span id="iv.vi.iii.lviii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.lviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter LVIII</span>.—*How he destroyed
the Temple of Venus at Heliopolis, and built the First Church in that
City.*

<span id="iv.vi.iii.lviii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.lviii-p2.1"></span>Such</span> actions as I have described
may well be reckoned among the emperor’s noblest achievements, as also
the wise arrangements which he made respecting each particular province.
We may instance the Phœnician city Heliopolis, in which those who
dignify licentious pleasure with a distinguishing title of honor, had
permitted their wives and daughters to commit shameless fornication. But
now a new statute, breathing the very spirit of modesty, proceeded from
the emperor, which peremptorily forbade the con<span id="page_536">p.
536</span> <span id="iv.vi.iii.lviii-Page_536"></span>tinuance of former
practices. And besides this he sent them also written exhortations, as
though he had been especially ordained by God for this end, that he
might instruct all men in the principles of chastity. Hence, he
disdained not to communicate by letter even with these persons, urging
them to seek diligently the knowledge of God. At the same time he
followed up his words by corresponding deeds, and erected even in this
city a church of great size and magnificence: so that an event unheard
of before in any age, now for the first time came to pass, namely, that
a city which had hitherto been wholly given up to superstition now
obtained the privilege of a church of God, with presbyters and deacons,
and its people were placed under the presiding care of a bishop
consecrated to the service of the supreme God. And further, the emperor,
being anxious that here also as many as possible might be won to the
truth, bestowed abundant provision for the necessities of the poor,
desiring even thus to invite them to seek the doctrines of salvation, as
though he were almost adopting the words of him who said, “Whether in
pretense, or in truth, let Christ be preached.” <span
