Third Ruler of the Church of Alexandria.*

<span id="iii.viii.xxi-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.viii.xxi-p2.1"></span>After</span> Nerva had reigned a little
more than a year <span id="fr_731"></span>[732](#fn_731.md) he was
succeeded by Trajan. It was during the first year of his reign that
Abilius, <span id="fr_732"></span>[733](#fn_732.md) who had ruled the
church of Alexandria for thirteen years, was succeeded by Cerdon. <span
id="fr_733"></span>[734](#fn_733.md)

<span id="iii.viii.xxi-p6"></span>2. He was the third that presided over
that church after Annianus, <span id="fr_734"></span>[735](#fn_734.md) who
was the first. At that time Clement still ruled the church of Rome,
being also the third that held the episcopate there after Paul and
Peter.

<span id="iii.viii.xxi-p8"></span>3. Linus was the first, and after him
came Anencletus. <span id="fr_735"></span>[736](#fn_735.md)
