<span id="iv.vi.iv.xlv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.xlv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLV</span>.—*Various Discourses by
the Assembled Bishops; also by Eusebius, the Writer of this History.*

<span id="iv.vi.iv.xlv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.xlv-p2.1"></span>Meantime</span> the festival derived
additional luster both from the prayers and discourses of the ministers
of God, some of whom extolled the pious emperor’s willing devotion to
the Saviour of mankind, and dilated on the magnificence of the edifice
which he had raised to his memory. Others afforded, as it were, an
intellectual feast to the ears of all present, by public disquisitions
on the sacred doctrines of our religion. Others interpreted passages of
holy Scripture, and unfolded their hidden meaning; while such as were
unequal to these efforts presented a bloodless sacrifice and mystical
service to God in the prayers which they offered for general peace, for
the Church of God, for the emperor himself as the instrumental cause of
so many blessings, and for his pious sons. I myself too, unworthy as I
was of such a privilege, pronounced various public orations in honor of
this solemnity, wherein I partly explained by a written description the
details of the imperial edifice, and partly endeavored to gather from
the prophetic visions apt illustrations of the symbols it
displayed. <span id="fr_3342"></span>[3343](#fn_3342.md) Thus joyfully was
the festival of dedication celebrated in the thirtieth year of our
emperor’s reign.

Jerusalem, in his fourth Homily, explains this passage in Zephaniah of
the Martyrium, of Basilica, which Constantine built on the spot of the
Lord’s resurrection. Let any one examine the whole passage (allowing for
the mistake of one Hebrew word for another by the LXX), and say, if this
be a fair specimen, what we are to think of the Fathers of the fourth
century as interpreters of Scripture. See also Bk. 3, ch. 33,
note.—*Bag.*\] “Interpreted pertinent passages from the
prophets.”—*Str.* and *Molz.*
