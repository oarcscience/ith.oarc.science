<span id="iii.xi.xx-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xi.xx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XX.—</span>*The Extant Works of the
Writers of that Age.*

<span id="iii.xi.xx-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xi.xx-p2.1"></span>There</span> flourished many learned men in
the Church at that time, whose letters to each other have been preserved
and are easily accessible. They have been kept until our time in the
library at Ælia, <span id="fr_1932"></span>[1933](#fn_1932) which was
established by Alexander, who at that time presided over that church. We
have been able to gather from that library material for our present
work.

<span id="iii.xi.xx-p4"></span>2. Among these Beryllus <span
id="fr_1933"></span>[1934](#fn_1933) has left us, besides letters and
treatises, various elegant works. He was bishop of Bostra in Arabia.
Likewise also Hippolytus, <span id="fr_1934"></span>[1935](#fn_1934) who
presided over another church, has left writings.

<span id="iii.xi.xx-p7"></span>3. There has reached us also a dialogue
of Caius, <span id="fr_1935"></span>[1936](#fn_1935) a very learned man,
which was held at Rome under Zephyrinus, <span
id="fr_1936"></span>[1937](#fn_1936) with Proclus, who contended for the
Phrygian heresy. In this he curbs the rashness and boldness of his
opponents in setting forth new Scriptures. He mentions only thirteen
epistles of the holy apostle, not counting that to the Hebrews <span
id="fr_1937"></span>[1938](#fn_1937) with the others. And unto our day
there are some among the Romans who do not consider this a work of the
apostle.

history of this library of Alexander, but it had already been in
existence nearly a hundred years when Eusebius examined it.
