<span id="iv.vi.iv.liii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.liii-p1.1"></span>Chapter LIII</span>.—*Having reigned
about Thirty-Two Years, and lived above Sixty, he still had a Sound
Body.*

<span id="iv.vi.iv.liii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.liii-p2.1"></span>He</span> completed the time of his reign
in two and thirty years, wanting a few months and days, <span
id="fr_3350"></span>[3351](#fn_3350) and his whole life extended to
about twice that period. At this age he still possessed a sound and
vigorous body, free from all blemish, and of more than youthful
vivacity; a noble mien, and strength equal to any exertion; so that he
was able to join in martial exercises, to ride, endure the fatigues of
travel, engage in battle, and erect trophies over his conquered enemies,
besides gaining those bloodless victories by which he was wont to
triumph over those who opposed him. <span
