id="iii.xvi.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI. <span
id="fr_2950"></span>[2951](#fn_2950) —</span>*Copy of an Imperial
Epistle in which Money is granted to the Churches.* <span
id="fr_2951"></span>[2952](#fn_2951)

<span id="iii.xvi.vi-p4"></span>1. “<span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xvi.vi-p4.1"></span>Constantine Augustus</span> to
Cæcilianus, <span id="fr_2952"></span>[2953](#fn_2952) bishop of
Carthage. Since it is our pleasure that something should be granted in
all the provinces of Africa and Numidia and Mauritania to certain
ministers of the legitimate <span id="fr_2953"></span>[2954](#fn_2953)
and most holy catholic religion, to defray their expenses, I have
written to Ursus, <span id="fr_2954"></span>[2955](#fn_2954) the
illustrious finance minister <span id="fr_2955"></span>[2956](#fn_2955)
of Africa, and have directed him to make provision to pay to thy
firmness three thousand folles. <span
id="fr_2956"></span>[2957](#fn_2956)

<span id="iii.xvi.vi-p10"></span>2. Do thou there<span id="page_383">p.
383</span> <span id="iii.xvi.vi-Page_383"></span>fore, when thou hast
received the above sum of money, command that it be distributed among
all those mentioned above, according to the brief <span
id="fr_2957"></span>[2958](#fn_2957) sent to thee by Hosius. <span
id="fr_2958"></span>[2959](#fn_2958)

<span id="iii.xvi.vi-p13"></span>3. But if thou shouldst find that
anything is wanting for the fulfillment of this purpose of mine in
regard to all of them, thou shalt demand without hesitation from
Heracleides, <span id="fr_2959"></span>[2960](#fn_2959) our
treasurer, <span id="fr_2960"></span>[2961](#fn_2960) whatever thou
findest to be necessary. For I commanded him when he was present that if
thy firmness should ask him for any money, he should see to it that it
be paid without delay.

<span id="iii.xvi.vi-p16"></span>4. And since I have learned that some
men of unsettled mind wish to turn the people from the most holy and
catholic Church by a certain method of shameful corruption, <span
id="fr_2961"></span>[2962](#fn_2961) do thou know that I gave command to
Anulinus, the proconsul, and also to Patricius, <span
id="fr_2962"></span>[2963](#fn_2962) vicar of the prefects, <span
id="fr_2963"></span>[2964](#fn_2963) when they were present, that they
should give proper attention not only to other matters but also above
all to this, and that they should not overlook such a thing when it
happened. Wherefore if thou shouldst see any such men continuing in this
madness, do thou without delay go to the above-mentioned judges and
report the matter to them; that they may correct them as I commanded
them when they were present. <span id="fr_2964"></span>[2965](#fn_2964)
The divinity of the great God preserve thee for many years.”

<span id="iii.xvi.vi-p2"></span> Upon the title of this chapter given in

<span id="iii.xvi.vi-p3"></span> The accompanying epistle furnishes the
first instance which we have of financial support furnished the clergy
by the state. From this time on the old system of voluntary
contributions fell more and more into disuse, and the clergy gained
their support from the income upon the church property, which
accumulated rapidly, in consequence of special grants by the state and
voluntary gifts and legacies by pious Christians, or from imperial
bounties, as in the present case. Chrysostom, however, complains that
the clergy in his time were not as well supported as under the ancient
voluntary system. The accuracy of his statement, however, is open to
doubt, as is the accuracy of all such comparisons between an earlier age
and our own, unless it be based upon exhaustive statistics. Upon the
general subject of the maintenance of the clergy in the early Church,
see Bingham’s *Antiquities*, Bk. V. Compare also Hatch’s *Constitution
of the Early Christian Churches*, p. 150 sq. Upon the Montanistic
practice of paying their clergy salaries, see above, Bk. V. chap. 18,
note 8, and for an example of the same thing among the Theodotians, see
Bk. V. chap. 28, § 10.

<span id="iii.xvi.vi-p9"></span> φόλλεις. We learn from Epiphanius (*De
pond. et mens*., at the end of the work; Dindorf’s ed. IV. p. 33) that
there were two folles, one a small coin, and the other a sum of money of
uncertain value. The latter is evidently referred to here. According to
one computation it was worth 208 denarii. If this were correct, the
present sum would amount to over ninety thousand dollars; but the truth
is, we can reach no certainty in the matter. For an exhaustive
discussion of the subject, see Petavius’ essay in Dindorf’s edition of
Epiphanius, IV. p. 109 sq.

id="iii.xvi.vi-p11.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xvi.vi-p12"></span> Doubtless to be identified with the
famous Hosius, bishop of Cordova in Spain, who was for many years
Constantine’s most influential adviser and took a prominent part in all
the great controversies of the first half of the fourth century, and who
died shortly before 360, when he was upwards of a hundred years old.
Upon his life, see especially the exhaustive article by Morse, in the
*Dict. of Christ. Biog*.

<span id="fn_2959"></span>[383:2960](2010303.htm#fr_2959) <span
id="iii.xvi.vi-p13.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xvi.vi-p14"></span> Heracleides is, so far as I am aware,
mentioned only here.

id="iii.xvi.vi-p16.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xvi.vi-p17"></span> This would seem to be a reference to
the Donatists. If it is, it leads us to suppose that Constantine had
heard about the troubles in Carthage before he received the
communication from Anulinus referred to in the previous chapter; for we
can hardly suppose that pending the trial of Cæcilian Constantine would
show him such signal marks of favor, which would lay him at once open to
the charge of partiality, and would be practically a prejudgment of the
case. On the other hand, he could not have referred to the Donatists in
this way after the trial of the case, for his words imply that he is
referring, not to an already well-established and well-known party, but
simply to individuals whom he has recently learned to be making some
kind of trouble in the church. These considerations seem to me to lead
to the conclusion that this epistle preceded the one to Miltiades quoted
in the previous chapter, and also the one from Anulinus to Constantine
(see notes 16 and 19 on that chapter). If this be so, it must have been
written as early as April, 313, and therefore soon after the epistle to
Anulinus quoted in the previous chapter, § 15 sq. We might then be led
to suppose that it was in consequence of this grant made by Constantine
solely to Cæcilian and the clergy under him that the Donatists decided
to appeal to the emperor, his treatment of all who were opposed to
Cæcilian showing them that he had heard reports of them by no means to
their advantage, and thus impelling them to try and set themselves right
in his eyes and in the eyes of the world by a public investigation of
their cause. There are difficulties connected with the exact order of
events at this point which beset any theory we may adopt, but the one
just stated seems to me most in harmony with our sources and with the
nature of the case. For a full, though not altogether satisfactory,
discussion of the matter, which I cannot dwell upon here, see Walch’s
*Ketzergeschichte*, IV. p. 116 sq.

<span id="iii.xvi.vi-p18"></span> This Patricius is known to us, so far
as I am aware, from this passage only.

<span id="fn_2963"></span>[383:2964](2010303.htm#fr_2963) <span
id="iii.xvi.vi-p18.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xvi.vi-p19"></span> τῷ οὐικαρί& 251· τῶν ἐπ€ρχων, which
doubtless represents the Latin *Vicarius Præfectorum*, the vicar or
deputy of the prefects. See Valesius’ note *ad locum* and the note of
Heinichen (Vol. III. p. 463), with the additional references given by
him.

<span id="fn_2964"></span>[383:2965](2010303.htm#fr_2964) <span
id="iii.xvi.vi-p19.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xvi.vi-p20"></span> This is the first instance we have of
an effort on Constantine’s part to suppress schismatics. In 316 he
enacted a stringent law against the Donatists (see the previous chapter,
note 16), which, however, he withdrew within a few years, finding the
policy of repression an unwise one. The same was done later in
connection with the Arians, whom he at first endeavored to suppress by
force, but afterward tolerated. His successors were in the main far less
tolerant than he was, and heretics and schismatics were frequently
treated with great harshness during the fourth and following centuries.
