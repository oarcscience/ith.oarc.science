<span id="iv.vi.iv.xxx-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.xxx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXX</span>.—*That he marked out
before a Covetous Man the Measure of a Grave, and so put him to Shame.*

<span id="iv.vi.iv.xxx-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.xxx-p2.1"></span>On</span> one occasion he thus personally
addressed one of his courtiers: “How far, my friend, are we to carry our
inordinate desires?” Then drawing the dimensions of a human figure with
a lance which he happened to have in his hand, he continued: “Though
thou couldst obtain the whole wealth of this world, yea, the whole world
itself, thou wilt carry with thee at last no more than this little spot
which I have marked out, if indeed even that be thine.” <span
id="fr_3328"></span>[3329](#fn_3328.md) Such were the words and actions of
this blessed prince; and though at the time he failed to reclaim any
from their evil ways, yet notwithstanding the course of events afforded
evident proof that his admonitions were more like Divine prophecies than
mere words.
