Judas.* <span id="fr_1806"></span>[1807](#fn_1806.md)

<span id="iii.xi.vii-p4"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xi.vii-p4.1"></span>At</span> this time another writer, Judas,
discoursing about the seventy weeks in Daniel, brings down the
chronology to the tenth year of the reign of Severus. He thought that
the coming of Antichrist, which was much talked about, was then
near. <span id="fr_1807"></span>[1808](#fn_1807.md) So greatly did the
agitation caused by the persecution of our people at this time disturb
the minds of many.

<span id="iii.xi.vii-p2"></span> The mention of the writer Judas at this
point seems, at first sight, as illogical as the reference to Clement in
the preceding chapter. But it does not violate chronology as that did;
and hence, if the account of Origen’s life was to be broken anywhere for
such an insertion, there was perhaps no better place. We cannot
conclude, therefore, that Eusebius, had he revised his work, would have
changed the position of this chapter, as Valesius suggests (see the
previous chapter, note 1).

<span id="iii.xi.vii-p3"></span>Jerome (*de vir. ill.* c. 52) repeats
Eusebius’ notice of Judas, but adds nothing to it, and we know no more
about him. Since he believed that the appearance of Antichrist was at
hand, he must have written before the persecutions had given place again
to peace, and hence not long after 202, the date to which he extended
his chronology. Whether the work mentioned by Eusebius was a commentary
or a work on chronology is not clear. It was possibly an historical
demonstration of the truth of Daniel’s prophecies, and an interpretation
of those yet unfulfilled, in which case it combined history and
exegesis.

<span id="fn_1807"></span>[254:1808](2010177.htm#fr_1807.md) <span
id="iii.xi.vii-p4.2"></span>

<span id="iii.xi.vii-p5"></span> It was the common belief in the Church,
from the time of the apostles until the time of Constantine, that the
second coming of Christ would very speedily take place. This belief was
especially pronounced among the Montanists, Montanus having proclaimed
that the *parousia* would occur before his death, and even having gone
so far as to attempt to collect all the faithful (Montanists) in one
place in Phrygia, where they were to await that event and where the new
Jerusalem was to be set up (see above, Bk. V. chap. 18, note 6). There
is nothing surprising in Judas’ idea that this severe persecution must
be the beginning of the end, for all through the earlier centuries of
the Church (and even to some extent in later centuries) there were never
wanting those who interpreted similar catastrophes in the same way;
although after the third century the belief that the end was at hand
grew constantly weaker.
