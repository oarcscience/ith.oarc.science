<span id="iv.vi.i.lix-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.lix-p1.1"></span>Chapter LIX</span>.—*That Maximin, blinded
by Disease, issued an Edict in Favor of the Christians.*

<span id="iv.vi.i.lix-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.lix-p2.1"></span>And</span> still the stroke of God
continued heavy upon him, so that his eyes protruded and fell from their
sockets, leaving him quite blind: and thus he suffered, by a most
righteous retribution, the very same punishment which he had been <span

first to devise for the martyrs of God. At length, however, surviving
even these sufferings, he too implored pardon of the God of the
Christians, and confessed his impious fighting against God: he too
recanted, as the former persecutor had done; and by laws and ordinances
explicitly acknowledged his error in worshiping those whom he had
accounted gods, declaring that he now knew, by positive experience, that
the God of the Christians was the only true God. These were facts which
Licinius had not merely received on the testimony of others, but of
which he had himself had personal knowledge: and yet, as though his
understanding had been obscured by some dark cloud of error, persisted
in the same evil course.
