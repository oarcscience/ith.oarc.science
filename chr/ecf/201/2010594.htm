Having heard, too, that there were many churches of God in Persia, and that large numbers there were gathered into the fold of Christ, full of joy at this intelligence, he resolved to extend his anxiety for the general welfare to that country also, as one whose aim it was to care for all alike in every nation.</p>

He was at various times a bitter persecutor of the Christians, and it is said (Plate) that &#8220;no Persian king had ever caused such terror to Rome as this monarch.&#8221; Compare article by Plate on the Sassanid&aelig; in Smith, <i>Dict. of Gr. and R.
