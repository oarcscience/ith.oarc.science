<span id="iv.vi.i.li-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.li-p1.1"></span>Chapter LI</span>.—*Intrigues of Licinius
against the Bishops, and his Prohibition of Synods.*

<span id="iv.vi.i.li-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.li-p2.1"></span>And</span> at first he made secret enquiry
respecting the ministers of God subject to his dominion, who had never,
indeed, in any respect offended against his government, in order to
bring false accusations against them. And when he found no ground of
accusation, and had no real ground of objection against them, he next
enacted a law, to the effect that the bishops should never on any
account hold communication with each other, nor should any one of them
absent himself on a visit to a neighboring church; nor, lastly, should
the holding of synods, or councils for the consideration of affairs of
common interest, <span id="fr_3151"></span>[3152](#fn_3151) be
permitted. Now this was clearly a pretext for displaying his malice
against us. For we were compelled either to violate the law, and thus be
amenable to punishment, or else, by compliance with its injunctions, to
nullify the statutes of the Church; inasmuch as it is impossible to
bring important questions to a satisfactory adjustment, except by means
of synods. In other cases also this God-hater, being determined to act
contrary to the God-loving prince, enacted such things. For whereas the
one assembled the priests of God in order to honor them, and to promote
peace and unity of judgment; the other, whose object it was to destroy
everything that was good, used all his endeavors to destroy the general
harmony.
