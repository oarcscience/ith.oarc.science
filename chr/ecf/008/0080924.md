id="vi.iv.xiii.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVII.—The Egyptians’ Defence of
Their System.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xiii.xvii-p2"></span>On Peter’s saying this, the
surrounding multitude laughed.  Then Peter said to the laughing
multitude:  “You laugh at their proceedings, not knowing that you are
yourselves much more objects of ridicule to them.  But you laugh at one
another’s proceedings; for, being led by evil custom into deceit, you do
not see your own.  But I admit that you have reason to laugh at the
idols of the Egyptians, since they, being rational, worship irrational
animals, and these altogether dying.  But listen to what they say when
they deride you.  We, they say, though we worship <span id="page_283">p.

yet still such as have once had life:  but you reverence things that
never lived.  And in addition to this, they say, We wish to honour the
form of the one God, but we cannot find out what it is, and so we choose
to give honour to every form.  And so, making some such statements as
these, they think that they judge more rightly than you do.
