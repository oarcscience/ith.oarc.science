<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xiv.xxvii-p2"></A>&#8220;Therefore approach, be ye righteous or unrighteous.&#160; For if you are righteous, baptism alone is lacking in order to salvation.&#160; But if you are unrighteous, come to be baptized for the remission of the sins formerly committed in ignorance.&#160; And to the unrighteous man it remains that his well-doing after baptism be according to the proportion of his <i>previous</i> impiety.&#160; Wherefore, be ye righteous or unrighteous, hasten to be born to God, because delay brings danger, on account of the fore-appointment of death being unrevealed; and show by well-doing your likeness to the Father, who begetteth you of water.&#160; As a lover of truth, honour the true God as your Father.&#160; But His honour is that you live as He, being righteous, would have you live.&#160; And the will of the righteous One is that you do no wrong.&#160; But wrong is murder, hatred, envy, and such like; and of these there are many forms.</p>
