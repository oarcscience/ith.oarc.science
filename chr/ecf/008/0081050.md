id="vi.iv.xviii.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter X.—Poverty Not Necessarily
Righteous.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xviii.x-p2"></span>And our father said:  “How then is
this?  Do we not see many impious men poor?  Then do these belong to the
saved on this account?”  And Peter said:  “Not at all; for that poverty
is not acceptable which longs for what it ought not.  So that some are
rich as far as their choice goes, though poor in actual wealth, and they
are punished because they desire to have more.  But one is not
unquestionably righteous because he happens to be poor.  For he can be a
beggar as far as actual wealth is concerned, but he may desire and even
do what above everything he ought not to do. Thus he may worship idols,
or be a blasphemer or fornicator, or he may live indiscriminately, or
perjure himself, or lie, or live the life of an unbeliever. But our
teacher pronounced the faithful poor blessed; <span

given anything, for they had nothing, but because they were not to be
condemned, as having done no sin, simply because they gave no alms,
because they had nothing to give.”  And our father said:  “In good truth
all seems to go right as far as the subject of discussion is concerned;
wherefore I have resolved to listen to the whole of your argument in
regular order.”
