<span id="vi.iv.xxii.xxii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.xxii.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXII.—Sins of Ignorance.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxii.xxii-p2"></span>And Simon:  “Why is it, then, that
some die prematurely, and periodical diseases arise; and that there are,
moreover, attacks of demons, and of madness, and all other kinds of
afflictions which can greatly punish?”  And Peter said:  “Because men,
following their own pleasure in all things, cohabit without observing
the proper times; and thus the deposition of seed, taking place
unseasonably, naturally produces a multitude of evils.  For they ought
to reflect, that as a season has been fixed suitable for planting and
sowing, <span id="fr_1464"></span>[1465](#fn_1464.md) so days have been
appointed as appropriate for cohabitation, which are carefully to be
observed.  Accordingly some one well instructed in the doctrines taught
by Moses, finding fault with the people for their sins, called them sons
of the new moons and the sabbaths. <span
id="fr_1465"></span>[1466](#fn_1465.md)   Yet in the beginning of the world
men lived long, and had no diseases.  But when through carelessness they
neglected the observation of the proper times, then the sons in
succession cohabiting through ignorance at times when <span
id="fr_1466"></span>[1467](#fn_1466.md) they ought not, place their
children under innumerable afflictions.  Whence our Teacher, when we
inquired of Him <span id="fr_1467"></span>[1468](#fn_1467.md) in regard to
the man who was blind from his birth, and recovered his sight, if this
man sinned, or his parents, that he should be born blind, answered,
‘Neither did he sin at all, nor his parents, but that the power of God
might be made manifest through him in healing the sins of
ignorance.’ <span id="fr_1468"></span>[1469](#fn_1468.md)   And, in truth,
such afflictions arise because of ignorance; as, for instance, by not
knowing when one ought to cohabit with his wife, as if she be pure from
her discharge.  Now the afflictions which you mentioned before are the
result of ignorance, and not, assuredly, of any wickedness that has been
perpetrated.  Moreover, give me the man who sins not, and I will show
you the man who suffers not; and you will find that he not only does not
suffer himself, but that he is able <span
id="fr_1469"></span>[1470](#fn_1469.md) to heal others.  For instance,
Moses, on account of his <span id="page_338">p. 338</span> <span
id="vi.iv.xxii.xxii-Page_338"></span>piety, continued free from
suffering all his life, and by his prayers he healed the Egyptians when
they suffered on account of their sins.”
