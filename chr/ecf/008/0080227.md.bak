Made.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.v.xvii-p2"></span>But Simon, perceiving that Peter was
clearly assigning a reason from the head of prophecy, from which the
whole question is settled, declined that the discourse should take this
turn; and thus answered:  “Give me an answer to the questions that I
put, and tell me, if that visible heaven is, as you say, to be
dissolved, why was it made at first?”  Peter answered:  “It was made for
the sake of this present life of men, that there might be some sort of
interposition and separation, lest any unworthy one might see the
habitation of the celestials and the abode of God Himself, which are
prepared in order to be seen by those only who are of pure heart. <span

conflict, it has pleased Him that those things be invisible, which are
destined as a reward to the conquerers.”  Then Simon said:  “If the
Creator is good, and the world is good, how shall He who is good ever
destroy that which is good?  But if He shall destroy that which is good,
how shall He Himself be thought to be good?  But if He shall dissolve
and destroy it as evil, how shall He not appear to be evil, who has made
that which is evil?”
