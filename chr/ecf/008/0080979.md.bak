<span id="vi.iv.xv.viii-p2"></span>Then Peter inquired, “Are you really,
then, alone in your family?”  Then I answered, “There are indeed many
and great men, being of the kindred of Cæsar.  Wherefore Cæsar himself
gave a wife of his own family to my father, who was his foster-brother;
and of her three sons of us were born, two before me, who were twins and
very like each other, as my father told me.  But I scarcely know either
them or our mother, but bear about with me an obscure image of them, as
through dreams.  My mother’s name was Mattidia, and my father’s,
Faustus; and of my brothers one was called Faustinus, and the other
Faustinianus. <span id="fr_1145"></span>[1146](#fn_1145.md)   Then after I,
their third son, was born, my mother saw a vision—so my father told
me—*which told her*, that unless she immediately took away her twin
sons, and left the city of Rome for exile for twelve years, she and they
must die by an all-destructive fate.
