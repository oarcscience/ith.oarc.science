id="vi.iv.ix.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIII.—Kronos and
Aphrodite.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.ix.xiii-p2"></span>“And the bonds of Kronos are the
binding together of heaven and earth, as I have heard others
allegorizing; and his mutilation is the separation and parting of the
elements; for they all were severed and separated, according to their
respective natures, that each kind might be arranged by itself.  And
time no longer begets anything; but the things which have been begotten
of it, by a law of nature, produce their successors.  And the Aphrodite
who emerged from the sea is the fruitful substance which arises out of
moisture, with which the warm spirit mixing, causes that sexual desire,
and perfects the beauty of the world.
