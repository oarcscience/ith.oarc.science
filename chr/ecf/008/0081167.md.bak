<span id="vi.iv.xxiii.xxii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.xxiii.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXII.—Appion and Athenodorus
Return to Simon.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxiii.xxii-p2"></span>When Appion and those who were
with him heard this, they howled and lamented, saying:  <span
id="page_346">p. 346</span> <span
id="vi.iv.xxiii.xxii-Page_346"></span>“Why did you not receive him?” 
And when at the same time Athenodorus wished to say to me, “It was
Faustus, your father;” Appion anticipated him, and said, “We learned
from some one that Simon, finding him, urged him *to go along with
him*, <span id="fr_1543"></span>[1544](#fn_1543.md) Faustus himself
entreating him, since he did not wish to see his sons after they had
become Jews.  And hearing this, we came, for his own sake, in search of
him.  But since he is not here, it is plain that he spake the truth who
gave us the information which we, hearing it from him, have given to
you.”  And I Clement, perceiving the design of Peter, that he wished to
beget a suspicion in them that he intended to look out among them for
the old man, that they might be afraid and take to flight, assisted in
his design, and said to Appion:  “Listen to me, my dearest Appion.  We
were eager to give to him, as being our father, what we ourselves deemed
to be good.  But if he himself did not wish to receive it, but, on the
contrary, fled from us in horror, I shall make a somewhat harsh remark,
‘Nor do we care for him.’”  And when I said this, they went away, as if
irritated by my savageness; and, as we learn next day, they went to
Judæa in the track of Simon.
