Prophet.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.xii.li-p2"></span>“Then, besides, of what sort is that
which some of the philosophers have presumed to speak even concerning
God, though they are mortal, and can only speak by opinion concerning
invisible things, or concerning the origin of the world, since they were
not present when it was made, or concerning the end of it, or concerning
the treatment and judgment of souls in the infernal regions, forgetting
that it belongs indeed to a reasonable man to know things present and
visible, but that it is the part of prophetic prescience alone to know
things past, and things future, and things invisible?  These things,
therefore, are not to be gathered from conjectures and opinions, in
which men are greatly deceived, but from faith in prophetic truth, as
this doctrine of ours is.  For we speak nothing of ourselves, nor
announce things gathered by human judgment; for this were to deceive our
hearers.  But we preach the things which have been committed and
revealed to us by the true Prophet.  And concerning His prophetic
prescience and power, if any one, as I have said, wishes to receive
clear proofs, let him come instantly and be alert to hear, and we shall
give evident proofs by which he shall seem not only to hear the power of
prophetic prescience with his ears, but even to see it with his eyes and
handle it with his hand; and when he has entertained a sure faith
concerning Him, he will without any labour take upon him the yoke of
righteousness and piety; <span id="fr_879"></span>[880](#fn_879.md) and so
great sweetness will he perceive in it, that not only will he not find
fault with any labour being in it, but will even desire something
further to be added and imposed upon him.”
