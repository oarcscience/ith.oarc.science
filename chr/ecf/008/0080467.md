id="vi.iii.x.lxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter LXI.—Ignorance of the
Philosophers.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.x.lxi-p2"></span>“For let us consider carefully the
work of divine providence. <span id="fr_831"></span>[832](#fn_831.md)   For
whereas the philosophers have introduced certain subtile and difficult
words, so that not even the terms that they use in their discourses can
be known and understood by all, God has shown that those who thought
themselves word-framers are altogether unskilful as respects the
knowledge of the truth.  For the knowledge of things which is imparted
by the true Prophet is simple, and plain, and brief; which those men
walking through devious places, and through the stony difficulties of
words, are wholly ignorant of.  Therefore, to modest and simple minds,
when they see things come to pass which have been foretold, it is
enough, and more than enough, that they may receive most certain
knowledge from most certain prescience; and for the rest may be at
peace, having received evident knowledge of the truth.  For all other
things are treated by opinion, in which there can be nothing firm.  For
what speech is there which may not be contradicted?  And what argument
is there that may not be overthrown by another argument?  And hence it
is, that by disputation of this sort men can never come to any end of
knowledge and learning, but find the end of their life sooner than the
end of their questions.
