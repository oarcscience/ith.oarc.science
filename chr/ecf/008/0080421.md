id="vi.iii.x.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XV.—Theories of Creation.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.x.xv-p2"></span>“For the Greek philosophers, inquiring
into the beginnings of the world, have gone, some in one way and some in
another.  In short, Pythagoras says that numbers are the elements of its
beginnings; Callistratus, that qualities; Alcmæon, that contrarieties;
Anaximander, that immensity; Anaxagoras, that equalities of parts;
Epicurus, that atoms; Diodorus, that <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iii.x.xv-p2.1"></span>ἀμερῆ</span>, that is, things in which
there are no parts; Asclepius, that <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iii.x.xv-p2.2"></span>ὄγκοι</span>, which we may call tumours or
swellings; the geometricians, that ends; Democritus, that ideas; Thales,
that water; Heraclitus, that fire; Diogenes, that air; Parmenides, that
earth; Zeno, Empedocles, Plato, that fire, water, air, and earth. 
Aristotle also introduces a fifth element, which he called <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.iii.x.xv-p2.3"></span>ἀκατονόμαστον</span>;
that is, that which cannot be named; without doubt indicating Him who
made the world, by joining the four elements into one.  Whether,
therefore, there be two, or three, or four, or more, or innumerable
elements, of which the world consists, in every supposition there is
shown to be a God, who collected many into one, and again drew them,
when collected, into diverse species; and by this it is proved that the
machine of the world could not have subsisted without a maker and a
disposer.
