Phœnicia to go to Antioch of Syria, on the same day we came to Orthasia,
and there stayed. <span id="fr_1140"></span>[1141](#fn_1140.md)   And on
account of its being near the city which we had left, almost all having
heard the preaching before, we stopped there only one day, and set out
to Antaradus.  And as there were many who journeyed with us, Peter,
addressing Nicetus and Aquila, said, “Inasmuch as the great crowd of
those who journey with us draws upon us no little envy as we enter city
after city, I have thought that we must of necessity arrange, so that
neither, on the one hand, these may be grieved at being prevented from
accompanying us, nor, on the other hand, we, by being so conspicuous,
may fall under the envy of the wicked. <span
id="fr_1141"></span>[1142](#fn_1141.md)   Wherefore I wish you, Nicetus and
Aquila, to go before me in two separate bodies, and enter secretly into
the Gentile cities.
