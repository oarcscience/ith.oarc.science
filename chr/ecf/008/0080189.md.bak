Absurdum</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iv.lii-p2"></span>Then Peter said:  “I wonder how you
have been able to learn more from the law than the law was able to know
or to teach; and how you say that you adduce proofs from the law of
those things which you are pleased to assert, when you declare that
neither the law, nor He who gave the law—that is, the Creator of the
world—knows those things of which you speak!  But this also I wonder at,
how you, who alone know these things, should be standing here now with
us all, circumscribed by the limits of this small court.”  Then Simon,
seeing Peter and all the people laughing, said:  “Do you laugh, Peter,
while so great and lofty matters are under discussion?”  Then said
Peter:  “Be not enraged, Simon, for we are doing no more than keeping
our promise:  for we are neither shutting our ears, as you said, nor did
we take to flight as soon as we heard you propound your unutterable
things; but we have not even stirred from the place.  For indeed you do
not even propound things that have any resemblance to truth, which might
to a certain extent frighten us.  Yet, at all events, disclose to us the
meaning of this saying, how from the law you have learned of a God whom
the law itself does not know, and of whom He who gave the law is
ignorant.”  Then Simon said:  “If you have done laughing, I shall prove
it by clear assertions.”  Then Peter said:  “Assuredly I shall give
over, that I may learn from you how you have learned from the law what
neither the law nor the God of the law Himself knows.”
