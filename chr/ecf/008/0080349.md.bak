id="vi.iii.vii.xxxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXV.—Judgment to Come.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.vii.xxxv-p2"></span>“But he does not receive these
things as true who does not believe that there is to be a judgment of
God, and therefore, being bound by the pleasures of the present life, is
shut out from eternal good things; and therefore we do not neglect to
proclaim to you what we know to be necessary for your salvation, and to
show you what is the true worship of God, that, believing in God, you
may be able, by means of good works, to be heirs with us of the world to
come.  But if you are not yet convinced that what we say is true,
meantime, in the first instance, you ought not to take it amiss and to
be hostile to us because we announce to you the things which we consider
to be good, and because we do not grudge to bestow also upon you that
which we believe brings salvation to ourselves, labouring, as I have
said, with all eagerness, that we may have you as fellow-heirs of the
blessings which we believe are to befall ourselves.  But whether those
things which we declare to you are certainly true, you shall not be able
to know otherwise than by rendering obedience to the things which are
commanded, that you may be taught by the issue of things, and the most
certain end of blessedness.
