<span id="x.xv"></span>

<span id="x.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c6"><span
id="x.xv-p1.1"></span>Pantænus, <span
id="fr_3810"></span>[3811](#fn_3810.md) the Alexandrian Philosopher.</span>

<span id="x.xv-p3"></span>\[<span class="c9"><span
id="x.xv-p3.1"></span>a.d.</span> 182–192–212.\]  The world owes more to
Pantænus than to all the other Stoics put together.  His mind discovered
that true philosophy is found, not in the Porch, but in Nazareth, in
Gethsemane, in Gabbatha, in Golgotha; and he set himself to make it
known to the world.  We are already acquainted with the great master of
Clement, <span id="fr_3811"></span>[3812](#fn_3811.md) “the Sicilian bee,”
that forsook <span id="page_777">p. 777</span> <span
id="x.xv-Page_777"></span>the flowers of Enna, to enrich Alexandria with
what is “sweeter than honey and the honey-comb;” and we remember that he
became a zealous missionary to the Oriental Ethiopia, and found there
the traces of St. Matthias’ labours, and those also of St. Bartholomew. 
From this mission he seems to have returned about <span class="c9"><span
id="x.xv-p4.1"></span>a.d.</span> 192.  Possibly he was master of the
Alexandrian school before he went to India, and came back to his chair
when that mission was finished.  There he sat till about <span
class="c9"><span id="x.xv-p4.2"></span>a.d.</span> 212, and under him
this Christian academy became famous.  It had existed as a catechetical
school from the Apostles’ time, according to St. Jerome.  I have
elsewhere noted some reasons for supposing that its founder may have
been Apollos. <span id="fr_3812"></span>[3813](#fn_3812.md)   All the
learning of Christendom may be traced to this source; and blessed be the
name of one of whom all we know is ennobling to the Church, and whose
unselfish career was a track of light “shining more and more unto the
perfect day.”

<span id="x.xv-p6"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="x.xv-p6.1"></span>I. <span id="fr_3813"></span>[3814](#fn_3813.md)
</span>

<span id="x.xv-p8"></span>“<span class="c9"><span
id="x.xv-p8.1"></span>In</span> the sun hath He set His tent.” <span
id="fr_3814"></span>[3815](#fn_3814.md)   Some affirm that the reference is
to the Lord’s body, which He Himself places in the sun; <span
id="fr_3815"></span>[3816](#fn_3815.md) Hermogenes, for instance.  As to
His body, some say it is His tent, others the Church of the faithful. 
But our Pantænus said:  “The language employed by prophecy is for the
most part indefinite, the present tense being used for the future, and
again the present for the past.”

<span id="x.xv-p11"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="x.xv-p11.1"></span>II. <span id="fr_3816"></span>[3817](#fn_3816.md)
</span>

<span id="x.xv-p13"></span>This mode of speaking Saint Dionysius the
Areopagite declares to be used in Scripture to denote predeterminations
and expressions of the divine will. <span
id="fr_3817"></span>[3818](#fn_3817.md)   In like manner also the followers
of Pantænus, <span id="fr_3818"></span>[3819](#fn_3818.md) who became the
preceptor of the great Clement the Stromatist, affirm that they are
commonly used in Scripture for expressions of the divine will. 
Accordingly, when asked by some who prided themselves on the outside
learning, <span id="fr_3819"></span>[3820](#fn_3819.md) in what way the
Christians supposed God to become acquainted with the universe, <span
id="fr_3820"></span>[3821](#fn_3820.md) their own opinion being that He
obtains His knowledge of it *in different ways*,—of things falling
within the province of the understanding by means of the understanding,
and of those within the region of the senses by means of the
senses,—they replied:  “Neither *does He gain acquaintance with*
sensible things by the senses, nor with things within the sphere of the
understanding by the understanding:  for it is not possible that He who
is above all existing things should apprehend them by means of existing
things.  We assert, on the contrary, that He is acquainted with existing
things as the products of His own volition.” <span
id="fr_3821"></span>[3822](#fn_3821.md)   They added, by way of showing the
reasonableness of their view:  “If He has made all things by an act of
His will (and no argument will be adduced to gainsay this), and if it is
ever a matter of piety and rectitude to say that God is acquainted with
His own will, and if He has voluntarily made every several thing that
has come into existence, then surely God must be acquainted with all
existing things as the products of His own will, seeing that it was in
the exercise of that will that He made them.”
