<span id="vi.iii.x.xxi-p2"></span>“But if you would rather have the
opinions of others of the Greek philosophers,—and you are acquainted
with mechanical science,—you are of course familiar with what is their
deliverance concerning the heavens.  For they suppose a sphere, equally
rounded in every direction, and looking indifferently to all points, and
at equal distances in all directions from the centre of the earth, and
so stable by its own symmetry, that its perfect equality does not permit
it to fall off to any side; and so the sphere is sustained, although
supported by no prop.  Now if the fabric of the world really has this
form, the divine work is evident in it.  But if, as others think, the
sphere is placed upon the waters, and is supported by them, or floating
in them, even so the work of a great contriver is shown in it.
