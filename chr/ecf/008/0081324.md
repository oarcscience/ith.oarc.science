<span id="vii.xvi.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vii.xvi.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 6 (22).</span>

<span id="vii.xvi.vi-p2"></span>When this was seen by Hades and Death,
and their impious officers, along with their cruel servants, they
trembled at perceiving in their own dominions the clearness of so great
a light, when they saw Christ suddenly in their abodes; and they cried
out, saying:  We have been overcome by thee.  Who art thou, that to the
Lord directest our confusion? <span id="fr_1985"></span>[1986](#fn_1985)
  Who art thou, that, undestroyed by corruption, the uncorrupted proof
of thy majesty, with fury condemnest our power?  Who art thou, so great
and little, lowly and exalted, soldier and commander, wonderful warrior
in the form of a slave, and the king of glory dead and alive, whom slain
the cross has carried?  Thou, who didst lie dead in the sepulchre, hast
come down to us alive; and in thy death every creature trembled, and the
stars in a body were moved; and now thou hast been made free among the
dead, and disturbest our legions.  Who art thou, that settest free those
who art held captive, bound by original sin, and recallest them to their
former liberty?  Who art thou, who sheddest a divine, and splendid, and
illuminating light upon those who have been blinded by the darkness of
their sins?

<span id="vii.xvi.vi-p4"></span>In like manner, also, all the legions of
the demons, terror-stricken with like fear from their fearful overthrow,
cried out, saying:  Whence art thou, O Jesus, a man so powerful and
splendid in majesty, so excellent, without spot, and free from guilt? 
For that world of earth which has been subject to us always until now,
which used to pay tribute for our uses, has never sent us such a dead
man, has never destined such gifts for the powers below.  Who therefore
art thou, that hast <span id="page_451">p. 451</span> <span
id="vii.xvi.vi-Page_451"></span>so intrepidly entered our bounds, and
who hast not only no fear of our punishments, but, moreover, attemptest
to take all away from our chains?  Perhaps thou art that Jesus of whom
our prince Satan said, that by thy death of the cross thou wast destined
to receive the dominion of the whole world.

<span id="vii.xvi.vi-p5"></span>Then the King of glory, trampling on
death by His majesty, and seizing Prince Satan, delivered him to the
power of Hades, and drew Adam to His brightness.

<span id="vii.xvi.vi-p3"></span> Some <span class="c9"><span

to God directest thy prayer to our confusion?  The correct reading may
be:  Who art thou, that bringest confusion upon our master?
