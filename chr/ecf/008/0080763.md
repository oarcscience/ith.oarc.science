<span id="vi.iv.vii.ii-p2"></span>“For we hear that Simon the magician,
being worsted at Cæsarea in the discussion with our lord Peter,
immediately hastened hither, and is doing much mischief.  For he is
slandering Peter, in opposition to truth, to all the adversaries, and
stealing away the souls of the multitude.  For he being a magician,
calls him a magician; and he being a deceiver, proclaims him as a
deceiver.  And although in the discussions he was beaten in all points,
and fled, yet he says that he was victorious; and he constantly charges
them that they ought not to listen to Peter,—as if, forsooth, he were
anxious that they may not be fascinated by a terrible magician.
