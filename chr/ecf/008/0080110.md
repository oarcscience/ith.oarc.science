Priest.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iii.xlviii-p2"></span>Then Peter answered, with an
appearance of indignation:  “What! do you suppose, Clement, that all of
us can know all things before the time?  But not to be drawn aside now
from our proposed discourse, we shall at another time, when your
progress is more manifest, explain these things more distinctly.

<span id="vi.iii.iii.xlviii-p3"></span>“Then, however, a priest or a
prophet, being anointed with the compounded ointment, putting fire to
the altar of God, was held illustrious in all the world.  But after
Aaron, who was a priest, another is taken out of the waters.  I do not
speak of Moses, but of Him who, in the waters of baptism, was called by
God His Son. <span id="fr_579"></span>[580](#fn_579.md)   For it is Jesus
who has put out, by the grace of baptism, that fire which the priest
kindled for sins; for, from the time when He appeared, the chrism has
ceased, by which the priesthood or the prophetic or the kingly office
was conferred.”
