Jews.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iii.lxiii-p2"></span>“Thus we argued and bore witness;
and we who were unlearned men and fishermen, taught the priests
concerning the one only God of heaven; the Sadducees, concerning the
resurrection of the dead; the Samaritans, concerning the sacredness of
Jerusalem (not that we entered into their cities, but disputed with them
in public); the scribes and Pharisees, concerning the kingdom of heaven;
the disciples of John, that they should not suffer John to be a
stumbling-block to them; and all the people, that Jesus is the eternal
Christ.  At last, however, I warned them, that before we should go forth
to the Gentiles, to preach to them the knowledge of God the Father, they
should themselves be reconciled to God, receiving His Son; for I showed
them that in no way else could they be saved, unless through the grace
of the Holy Spirit they hasted to be washed with the baptism of
threefold invocation, and received the Eucharist of Christ the Lord,
whom alone they ought to believe concerning those things which He
taught, that so they might merit to attain eternal salvation; but that
otherwise it was utterly impossible for them to be reconciled to God,
even if they should kindle a thousand altars and a thousand high altars
to Him.”
