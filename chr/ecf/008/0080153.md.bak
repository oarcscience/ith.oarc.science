id="vi.iii.iv.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVI.—Simon Magus:  Hopelessness
of His Case.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iv.xvi-p2"></span>But Peter, hearing these things, said
with tears: <span id="fr_610"></span>[611](#fn_610.md)   “Greatly do I
wonder at the infinite patience of God, and, on the other hand, at the
audacity of human rashness in some.  For what further reason can be
found to persuade Simon that God judges the unrighteous, since he
persuades himself that he employs the obedience of souls for the service
of his crimes?  But, in truth, he is deluded by demons.  Yet, although
he is sure by these very things that souls are immortal, and are judged
for the deeds which they have done, and although he thinks that he
really sees those things which we believe by faith; though, as I said,
he is deluded by demons, yet he thinks that he sees the very substance
of the soul.  How shall such a man, I say, be brought to confess either
that he acts wickedly while he occupies such an evil position, or that
he is to be judged for those things which he hath done, who, knowing the
judgment of God, despises it, and shows himself an enemy to God, and
dares commit such horrid things?  Wherefore it is certain, my brethren,
that some oppose the truth and religion of God, not because it appears
to them that reason can by no means stand with faith, but because they
are either involved in excess of wickedness, or prevented by their own
evils, or elated by the swelling of their heart, so that they do not
even believe those things which they think that they see with their own
eyes.”

of Peter is quite different and far less worthy.  In Homily III. 1–28 a
similar discourse is given, just before the discussion with Simon,
abounding in statements that suggest erroneous views of Scripture, and
indicate a Gnostic origin.—R.\]
