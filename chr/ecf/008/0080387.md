Woman.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.ix.xx-p2"></span>Then Peter, incapable of deception,
and moved with compassion, began to say:  “There is a certain young man
among those who follow me for the sake of religion and sect, a Roman
citizen, who told me that he had a father and two twin brothers, of whom
not one is left to him.  ‘My mother,’ he said, ‘as I learned from my
father, saw a vision, that she should depart from the Roman city for a
time with her twin sons, else they should perish by a dreadful death;
and when she had departed, she was nevermore seen.’  And afterwards his
father set out to search for his wife and sons, and was also lost.”
