id="vi.iii.iv.xxxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXII.—Simon’s
Challenge.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iv.xxxii-p2"></span>Then said Simon:  “I am astonished
at your folly.  For you so propound the words of your Master, as if it
were held to be certain concerning him that he is a prophet; while I can
very easily prove that he often contradicted himself.  In short, I shall
refute you from those words which you have yourself brought forward. 
For you say, that he said that every kingdom or every city divided in
itself shall not stand; and elsewhere you say, that he said that he
would send a sword, that he might separate those who are in one house,
so that son shall be divided from father, daughter from mother, brother
from brother; so that if there be five in one house, three shall be
divided against two, and two against three. <span

falls, he who makes divisions furnishes causes of falling; and if he is
such, assuredly he is wicked.  Answer this if you can.”
