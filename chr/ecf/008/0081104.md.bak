id="vi.iv.xxi.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter IX.—How Simon Bears His
Exposure.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxi.ix-p2"></span>When Peter said this, the multitudes
applauded. <span id="fr_1378"></span>[1379](#fn_1378.md)   But Simon, being
thus exposed, <span id="fr_1379"></span>[1380](#fn_1379.md) blushed through
shame, and rubbing his forehead, said:  “Well, then, do they declare
that I, a magician, yea, even I who syllogize, am conquered by Peter? 
It is not so.  But if one should syllogize, though carried away and
conquered, he still re<span id="page_327">p. 327</span> <span
id="vi.iv.xxi.ix-Page_327"></span>tains the truth that is in him.  For
the weakness in the defender is not identical with the truth in the
conquered man. <span id="fr_1380"></span>[1381](#fn_1380.md)   But I assure
you that I have judged all those who are bystanders worthy to know the
unrevealed Father.  Wherefore, because I publicly reveal him to them,
you yourself, through envy, are angry with me who wish to confer a
benefit on them.”

<span id="vi.iv.xxi.ix-p5"></span> This passage is deemed corrupt by
commentators.  We have made no change in the reading of the <span
class="c9"><span id="vi.iv.xxi.ix-p5.1"></span>mss.</span>, except that
of <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.xxi.ix-p5.2"></span>νενικημένην</span> into <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.iv.xxi.ix-p5.3"></span>νενικημένος</span>,
and perhaps even this is unnecessary.  The last sentence means:  “A man
may overcome the weakness of his adversary:  but he does not therefore
strip him of the truth, which he possesses even when he is conquered.” 
The Latin translation of Cotelerius, with some emendations from later
editors, yields this:  “But they say that I, a magician, am not merely
conquered by Peter, but reduced to straits by his reasonings.  But not
even though one be reduced to straits by reasonings, has he the truth
which is in him conquered.  For the weakness of the defender is not the
truth of the conqueror.”
