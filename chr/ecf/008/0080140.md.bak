id="vi.iii.iv.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter III.—Need of Caution.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iv.iii-p2"></span>Then Peter, being pleased to hear
that I understood the purport of his preface, that he had delivered it
for our advantage; and commending me, doubtless for the purpose of
encouraging, and stimulating me, began to deliver the following

be seasonable and necessary to have some discussion relating to those
things that are near at hand; that is, concerning Simon.  For I should
wish to know of what character and of what conduct he is.  Wherefore, if

whom the words of immortality are to be committed!  For we ought to be
careful, yea, extremely careful, that we cast not our pearls before
swine. <span id="fr_603"></span>[604](#fn_603.md)
