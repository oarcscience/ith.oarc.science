Continued.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.ix.xviii-p2"></span>“And, not to detain you with a long
and profitless story, I willingly dwelt with her on account of the
faithful affection which she retained for her husband.  But not long
after, my hands (unhappy woman that I was!), long torn with gnawing,
became powerless, and she who had taken me in fell into palsy, and now
lies at home in her bed; also the affection of those women who had
formerly pitied me grew cold.  We are both helpless.  I, as you see, sit
begging; and when I get anything, one meal serves two wretches.  Behold,
now you have heard enough of my affairs; why do you delay the fulfilment
of your promise, to give me a remedy, by which both of us may end our
miserable life without torment?”
