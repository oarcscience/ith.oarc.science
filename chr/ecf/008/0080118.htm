<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.iii.lvi-p2"></A>&#8220;But the party of the Sadducees, who deny the resurrection of the dead, were in a rage, so that one of them cried out from amongst the people, saying that those greatly err who think that the dead ever arise.&#160; In opposition to him, Andrew, my brother, answering, declared that it is not an error, but the surest matter of faith, that the dead rise, in accordance with the teaching of Him of whom Moses foretold that He should come the true Prophet.&#160; &#145;Or if,&#146; says he, &#145;you do not think that this is He whom Moses foretold, let this first be inquired into, so that when this is clearly proved to be He, there may be no further doubt concerning the things which He taught.&#146;&#160; These, and many such like things, Andrew proclaimed, and then stopped.&#8221;</p>
