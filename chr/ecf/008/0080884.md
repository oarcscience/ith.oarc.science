<span id="vi.iv.xii.i-p3"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iv.xii.i-p3.1"></span>Therefore</span> on the next day, Peter
going out with his companions, and coming to the former place, and
taking his stand, proceeded to say: <span
id="fr_1107"></span>[1108](#fn_1107)   “God having cut off by water all
the impious men of old, having found one alone amongst them all that was
pious, caused him to be saved in an ark, with his three sons and their
wives.  Whence may be perceived that it is His nature not to care for a
multitude of wicked, nor to be indifferent to the salvation of one
pious.  Therefore the greatest impiety of all is forsaking the sole Lord
of all, and worshipping many, who are no gods, as if they were gods.
