<span id="vii.xiii.ix-p2"></span>Other men cried:  This man is a
prophet, and the demons are afraid of him.  Pilate says:  And how were
the demons not at all thus afraid of your parents also?  They say:  We
do not know.  Others, again, said:  Lazarus, after having been four days
in the tomb, he raised by a single word. <span

raising of Lazarus, was afraid, and said to the people:  Why do you wish
to shed the blood of a just man?
