<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.x.i-p3"></A><span class="c9"><a name="vi.iii.x.i-p3.1"></A>Now</span> the next morning Peter took my brothers and me with him, and we went down to the harbour to bathe in the sea, and thereafter we retired to a certain secret place for prayer.&#160; But a certain poor old man, a workman, as he appeared by his dress, began to observe us eagerly, without our seeing him, that he might see what we were doing in secret.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_805"></A><A HREF="#fn_805"><FONT SIZE="1">806</FONT></A>
&#160; And when he saw us praying, he waited till we came out, and then saluted us, and said:&#160; &#8220;If you do not take it amiss, and regard me as an inquisitive and importunate person, I should wish to converse with you; for I take pity on you, and would not have you err under the appearance of truth, and be afraid of things that have no existence; or if you think that there is any truth in them, then declare it to me.&#160; If, therefore, you take it patiently, I can in a few words instruct you in what is right; but if it be unpleasant to you, I shall go on, and do my business.&#8221;&#160; To him Peter answered:&#160; &#8220;Speak what you think good, and we will gladly hear, whether it be true or false; for you are to be welcomed, because, like a father anxious on behalf of his children, you wish to put us in possession of what you regard as good.&#8221;</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="vi.iii.x.i-p4"></A> [From this point there are considerable variations in the two narratives.&#160; The old man becomes, in the <i>Recognitions</i>, a prominent participant in the discussions, arguing with Peter, and with Niceta, Aquila, and Clement.&#160; At the close of these discussions he is recognised first by the sons (ix. 35), and then by his wife, as Faustinianus (ix. 37).&#160; In the <i>Homilies</i> Peter tells of an interview with the old man (xiv. 2&#8211;8), and the recognition takes place immediately upon his appearance (xiv. 9).&#160; Some discussion with him follows (Homily XV.); but soon the main controversy is with Simon Magus (Homilies XVI.&#8211;XIX.), in the presence of the father, who is convinced by Peter.&#160; Book x. contains much matter introduced in Homilies IV.&#8211;VII.&#160; The correspondences will be indicated in the footnotes.&#8212;R.]</p>
