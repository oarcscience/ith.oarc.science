id="vi.iv.xxiii.xx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XX.—Faustus, His Wife, and Sons,
Prepare to Go to Antioch.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxiii.xx-p2"></span>When Peter suggested this, my father
said:  “I know what you want; wherefore take no trouble.  For assuredly
I shall take good care, when I reach that place, to make such statements
in regard to you as I ought to make.”  And Peter again suggested: 
“When, then, you perceive the city changing from its hatred of me, and
longing to see me, send information to me of this, and I shall come to
you immediately.  And when I arrive there, that same day I shall remove
the strange shape which now invests you, and I shall make your own
unmistakeably visible to your own people and to all others.”  Saying
this, he made his sons, my brothers, and our mother Mattidia to go along
with him; and he also commanded some of his more intimate acquaintances
to accompany him.  But my mother was <span
id="fr_1537"></span>[1538](#fn_1537.md) unwilling to go with him, and
said:  “I seem to be an adulteress if I associate with the shape of
Simon; but if I shall be compelled to go along with him, <span
id="fr_1538"></span>[1539](#fn_1538.md) it is impossible for me to recline
on the same couch with him!  But I do not know if I shall be persuaded
to go along with him.”  And while she was very unwilling to go, Annubion
urged her, saying:  “Believe me and Peter, and the very voice itself,
that this is *Faustus* your husband, whom I love not less than you.  And
I myself *will go* <span id="fr_1539"></span>[1540](#fn_1539.md) along with
him.”  When Annubion said this, our mother promised to go with him.
