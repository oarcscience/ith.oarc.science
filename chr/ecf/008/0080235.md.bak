id="vi.iii.v.xxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXV.—Learning Before
Teaching.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.v.xxv-p2"></span>To this Simon replied:  “Then truth is
not the property of all, but of those only who know the art of
disputation, which is absurd; for it cannot be, since He is equally the
God of all, that all should not be equally able to know His will.”  Then
Peter:  “All were made equal by Him, and to all He has given equally to
be receptive of truth.  But that none of those who are born, are born
with education, but education is subsequent to birth, no one can doubt. 
Since, therefore, the birth of men holds equity in this respect, that
all are equally capable of receiving discipline, the difference is not
in nature, but in education.  Who does not know that the things which
any one learns, he was ignorant of before he learned them?”  Then Simon
said “You say truly.”  Then Peter said, “If then in those arts which are
in common use, one first learns and then teaches, how much more ought
those who profess to be the educators of souls, first to learn, and so
to teach, that they may not expose themselves to ridicule, if they
promise to afford knowledge to others, when they themselves are
unskilful?”  Then Simon:  “This is true in respect of those arts which
are in common use; but in the word of knowledge, as soon as any one has
heard, he has learned.”
