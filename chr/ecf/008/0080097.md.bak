id="vi.iii.iii.xxxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXV.—The Exodus.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iii.xxxv-p2"></span>“After this, Moses, by the command
of God, whose providence is over all, led out the people of the Hebrews
into the wilderness; and, leaving the shortest road which leads from
Egypt to Judæa, he led the people through long windings of the
wilderness, that, by the discipline of forty years, the novelty of a
changed manner of life might root out the evils which had clung to them
by a long-continued familiarity with the customs of the Egyptians. 
Meantime they came to Mount Sinai, and thence the law was given to them
with voices and sights from heaven, written in ten precepts, of which
the first and greatest was that they should worship God Himself alone,
and not make to themselves any appearance or form <span
id="fr_556"></span>[557](#fn_556.md) to worship.  But when Moses had gone
up to the mount, and was staying there forty days, the people, although
they had seen Egypt struck with the ten plagues, and the sea parted and
passed over by them on foot, manna also given to them from heaven for
bread, and drink supplied to them out of the rock that followed <span
id="fr_557"></span>[558](#fn_557.md) them, which kind of food was turned
into whatever taste any one desired; and although, being placed under
the torrid region of heaven, they were shaded by a cloud in the
day-time, that they might not be scorched by the heat, and by night were
enlightened by a pillar of fire, lest the horror of darkness should be
added to the wasteness of the wilderness;—those very people, I say, when
Moses stayed in the mount, made and worshipped a golden calf’s head,
after the fashion of Apis, whom they had seen worshipped in Egypt; and
after so many and so great marvels which they had seen, were unable to
cleanse and wash out from themselves the defilements of old habit.  On
this account, leaving the short road which leads from Egypt to Judæa,
Moses conducted them by an immense circuit of the desert, if haply he
might be able, as we mentioned before, to shake off the evils of old
habit by the change of a new education.”
