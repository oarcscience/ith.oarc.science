<span id="vi.iv.vii.vi-p2"></span>Then I said:  “If our lord Peter did
not know that he himself alone can prevail against this power, he would
not have sent us before him with orders to get information secretly
concerning Simon, and to write to him.”  Then, as evening had come on,
we took supper, <span id="fr_1031"></span>[1032](#fn_1031.md) and went to
sleep.  But in the morning, one of Bernice’s friends came and said that
Simon had set sail for Sidon, and that he had left behind him Appion
Pleistonices, <span id="fr_1032"></span>[1033](#fn_1032.md) —a man of
Alexandria, a <span id="page_253">p. 253</span> <span
id="vi.iv.vii.vi-Page_253"></span>grammarian by profession, whom I knew
as being a friend of my father; and a certain astrologer, Annubion the
Diospolitan, and Athenodorus the Athenian, attached to the doctrine of
Epicurus.  And we, having learned these things concerning Simon, in the
morning wrote and despatched a letter to Peter, and went to take a walk.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.vi-p3"></span> Literally, “partook of salt.”

<span id="vi.iv.vii.vi-p4"></span> This epithet means, “the conqueror of
very many.”  Suidas makes Appion the son of Pleistonices.  \[Comp.
*Recognitions*, x. 52.  It is evident that the writer has in mind Apion,
the opponent of the Jews, against whom Josephus wrote his treatise. 
Compare the statement of Homily V. 2.  The entire discussion with
Appion, extending over Homilies IV.–VI. is peculiar to this narrative,
though much of the argument occurs in the discussion of Clement with his
father (*Recognitions*, x.).  Appion and Annubion are introduced in
*Recognitions*, x. 52, but not as disputants.  The discussion here is
constructed with much skill.—R.\]
