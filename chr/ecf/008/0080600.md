<span id="vi.iv.iii.xi-p2"></span>“Wherefore, being disciples of the
true Prophet, laying aside double-mindedness, from which comes
ill-doing, eagerly undertake well-doing.  But if any of you doubt
concerning the things which I have said are to be, let him confess it
without shame, if he cares for his own soul, and he shall be satisfied
by the president.  But if he has believed rightly, let his conversation
be with confidence, as fleeing from the great fire of condemnation, and
entering into the eternal good kingdom of God.
