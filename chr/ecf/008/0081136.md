<span id="vi.iv.xxii.xvii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.xxii.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVII.—The Devil Has Not Equal
Power with God.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxii.xvii-p2"></span>And Simon said:  “If, then, he
exists for ever, is not the fact of the sole government *of God* thus
destroyed, since there is another power, namely, that concerned with
matter, which rules along with Him?”  And Peter said:  “If they are
different in their substances, they are different also in their powers,
and the superior rules the inferior.  But if they are of the same
substance, then they are equal in power, and they are in like manner
good or bad.  But it is plain that they are not equal in power; for the
Creator put matter into that shape of a world into which He willed to
put it.  Is it then at all possible to maintain that it always existed,
being a substance; and is not matter, as it were, the storehouse of
God?  For it is not possible to maintain that there was a time <span
id="fr_1442"></span>[1443](#fn_1442.md) when God possessed nothing, but He
always was the only ruler of it.  Wherefore also He is an eternal sole
ruler; <span id="fr_1443"></span>[1444](#fn_1443.md) and on this account it
would justly be said to belong to Him who exists, and rules, and is
*eternal*.” <span id="fr_1444"></span>[1445](#fn_1444.md)   And Simon
said:  “What then?  Did the wicked one make himself?  And was God good
in such a way, that, knowing he would be the cause of evil, he yet did
not destroy him at his origination, when he could have been destroyed,
as not yet being perfectly made?  For if he came into being suddenly and
complete, then on that account <span
id="fr_1445"></span>[1446](#fn_1445.md) he is at war with the Creator, as
having come suddenly into being, possessed of equal power with him.”
