<span id="vi.iii.v.xi-p2"></span>Then said Peter:  “I advise that the
first inquiry be, whether it be in our power to know whence we are to be
judged.”  But Simon said:  “Not so; but concerning God, about whom all
who are present are desirous to hear.”  Then Peter:  “You admit, then,
that something is in the power of the will:  only confess this, if it is
so, and let us inquire, as you say, concerning God.”  To this Simon
answered:  “By no means.”  Then Peter said:  “If, then, nothing is in
our power, it is useless for us to inquire anything concerning God,
since it is not in the power of those who seek to find; hence I said
well, that this should be the first inquiry, whether <span

id="vi.iii.v.xi-Page_120"></span>anything is in the power of the
will.” <span id="fr_681"></span>[682](#fn_681)   Then said Simon:  “We
cannot even understand this that you say, if there is anything in the
power of the will.”  But Peter, seeing that he was turning to
contention, and, through fear of being overcome, was confounding all
things as being in general uncertain, answered:  “How then do you know
that it is not in the power of man to know anything, since this very
thing at least you know?”
