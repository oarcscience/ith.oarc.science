id="vi.iv.vii.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIX.—“Where Ignorance is
Bliss.”</span>

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xix-p2"></span>“Wherefore it behoves the young not
to be satisfied with those corrupting lessons, and those who are in
their prime should carefully avoid listening to the mythologies of the
Greeks.  For lessons about their gods are much worse than ignorance, as
we have shown from the case of those dwelling in the country, who sin
less through their not having been instructed by Greeks.  Truly, such
fables of theirs, and spectacles, and books, ought to be shunned, and if
it were possible, even their cities.  For those who are full of evil
learning, even with their breath infect as with madness those who
associate with them, with their own passions.  And what is worst,
whoever is most instructed among them, is so much the more turned from
the judgment which is according to nature.
