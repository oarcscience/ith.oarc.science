<span id="viii.iv.ii.i-p3"></span>(Of conspiracies and other illicit
pursuits, that they be not engaged in, and of the restoration of the
lapsed after penitence.)

<span id="viii.iv.ii.i-p4"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="viii.iv.ii.i-p4.1"></span>Callistus</span> to our most dearly
beloved brethren, all the bishops settled throughout Gaul.

<span id="viii.iv.ii.i-p5"></span>By the report of very many, we learn
that your love, by the zeal of the Holy Spirit, holds and guides the
helm of the Church so firmly in the face of all assaults, that by God’s
will it is conscious neither of shipwreck nor of the losses of
shipwreck.  Rejoicing, therefore, in such testimonies, we beg you not to
permit anything to be done in those parts contrary to the apostolic
statutes; but, supported by our authority, do ye check what is
injurious, and prohibit what is unlawful.
