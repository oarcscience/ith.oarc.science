<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.ix.vii-p2"></A>But I trembled when I heard this, and my tears immediately gushed forth, because so great a man, who is worth more than the whole world, had addressed such a proposal to me.&#160; Then he, when he saw me weeping, inquired the reason; and I answered him:&#160; &#8220;How have I so sinned against you, that you should distress me with such a proposal?&#8221;&#160; Then Peter:&#160; &#8220;If it is evil that I said I should serve you, you were first in fault in saying the same thing to me.&#8221;&#160; Then said I:&#160; &#8220;The cases are not alike:&#160; for it becomes me to do this to you; but it is grievous that you, who are sent as the herald of the Most High God to save the souls of men, should say it to me.&#8221;&#160; Then said Peter:&#160; &#8220;I should agree with you, were it not that our Lord, who came for the salvation of the whole world, and who was nobler than any creature, submitted to be a servant, that He might persuade us not to be ashamed to perform the ministry of servants to our brethren.&#8221;&#160; Then said I:&#160; &#8220;It were foolishness in me to suppose that I can prevail with you; nevertheless I give thanks to the providence of God, because I have merited to have you instead of parents.&#8221;</p>
