<span id="vi.iii.iv.xxv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iii.iv.xxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXV.—Principles on Which the
Discussion Should Be Conducted.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iv.xxv-p2"></span>“For some, in the contest of
disputations, when they perceive that their error is confuted,
immediately begin, for the sake of making good their retreat, to create
a disturbance, and to stir up strifes, that it may not be manifest to
all that they are defeated; and therefore I frequently entreat that the
investigation of the matter in dispute may be conducted with all
patience and quietness, so that if perchance anything seem to be not
rightly spoken, it may be allowed to go back over it, and explain it
more distinctly.  For sometimes a thing may be spoken in one way and
heard in another, while it is either advanced too obscurely, or not
attended to with sufficient care; and on this account I desire that our
conversation should be conducted patiently, so that neither should the
one snatch it away from the other, nor should the unseasonable speech of
one contradicting interrupt the speech of the other; and that we should
not cherish the desire of finding fault, but that we should be allowed,
as I have said, to go over again what has not been clearly enough
spoken, that by fairest examination the knowledge of the truth may
become clearer.  For we ought to know, that if any one is conquered by
the truth, it is not he that is conquered, but the ignorance which is in
him, which is the worst of all demons; so that he who can drive it out
receives the palm of salvation.  For it is our purpose to benefit the
hearers, not that we may conquer badly, but that we may be well
conquered for the acknowledgment of the truth.  For if our speech be
actuated by the desire of seeking the truth, even although we shall
speak anything imperfectly through human frailty, God in His unspeakable
goodness will fill up secretly in the understandings of the hearers
those things that are lacking.  For He is righteous; and according to
the purpose of every one, He enables some to find easily what they seek,
while to others He renders even that obscure which is before their
eyes.  Since, then, the way of God is the way of peace, let us with
peace seek the things which are God’s.  If any one has anything to
advance in answer to this, let him do so; but if there is no one who
wishes to answer, I shall begin to speak, and I myself shall bring
forward what another may object to me, and shall refute it.”
