<span id="viii.iv.ii.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="viii.iv.ii.iv-p1.1"></span>III.</span>

<span id="viii.iv.ii.iv-p2"></span>(That no bishop should presume in
anything pertaining to another’s parish, and of the transference of
bishops.)

<span id="viii.iv.ii.iv-p3"></span>Let no one, again, trespass upon the
boundaries of another, nor presume to judge or excommunicate one
belonging to another’s parish; because such judgment or ordination, or
excommunication or condemnation, shall neither be ratified nor have any
virtue; since no one shall be bound by the decision of another judge
than his own, neither shall he be condemned by such.  Whence also the
Lord speaks to this effect:  “Pass not the ancient landmarks which thy
fathers have set.” <span id="fr_2736"></span>[2737](#fn_2736.md)  
Moreover, let no primate or metropolitan *invade* the church or parish
of a diocesan (*diœcesani*), or presume to excommunicate or judge any
one belonging to his parish, or do anything without his counsel or
judgment; but let him observe this law, which has been laid down by the
apostles <span id="fr_2737"></span>[2738](#fn_2737.md) and fathers, and our
predecessors, and has been ratified by us:  to wit, that if any
metropolitan bishop, except in that which pertains to his own proper
parish alone, shall attempt to do anything without the counsel and
good-will of all the comprovincial bishops, he will do it at the risk of
his position, and what he does in this manner shall be held null and
void; but whatever it may be necessary to do or to arrange with regard
to the cases of the body of provincial bishops, and the necessities of
their churches and clergy and laity, this should be done by consent of
all the pontiffs of the same province, and that too without any pride of
lordship, but with the most humble and harmonious action, even as the
Lord says:  “I came not to be ministered unto, but to minister.” <span
id="fr_2738"></span>[2739](#fn_2738.md)   And in another passage He says: 
“And whosoever of you is the greater, shall be your servant,” <span
id="fr_2739"></span>[2740](#fn_2739.md) and so forth.  And in like manner
the bishops of the same province themselves should do all things in
counsel with him, except so much as pertains to their own proper
parishes, in accordance with the statutes of the holy fathers (who,
although they have preceded us by a certain interval of time, have yet
drawn the light of truth and faith from one and the same fountain of
purity, and have sought the prosperity of the Church of God and the
common advantage of all Christians by the same enlightening and guiding
Spirit), that <span id="page_616">p. 616</span> <span
id="viii.iv.ii.iv-Page_616"></span>with one mind, and one mouth, and one
accord, the Holy Trinity may be glorified for ever.  No primate, no
metropolitan, nor any of the other bishops, is at liberty to enter the
seat of another, or to occupy a possession which does not pertain to
him, and which forms part of the parish of another bishop, at the
direction of any one, unless he is invited by him to whose jurisdiction
it is acknowledged to belong; nor can he set about any arrangement or
ordinance, or judgment there, if he wishes to keep the honour of his
station.  But if he presume to do otherwise, he shall be condemned; and
not only he, but those who co-operate and agree with him:  for just as
the power of making appointments (*ordinatio*) is interdicted in such
circumstances, so also is the power of judging or of disposing of other
matters.  For if a man has no power to appoint, how shall he judge? 
Without doubt, he shall in no wise judge or have power to judge:  for
just as another man’s wife cannot intermarry with anyone (*adulterari*),
nor be judged or disposed of by any one but by her own husband so long
as he liveth; so neither can it in anywise be allowed that the wife of a
bishop, by whom undoubtedly is meant his church or parish, should be
judged or disposed of by another without his (the bishop’s) judgment and
good-will so long as he liveth, or enjoy another’s embrace, that is, his
ordaining.  Wherefore the apostle says:  “The wife is bound by the law
so long as her husband liveth; but if he be dead, she is loosed from the
law of her husband.” <span id="fr_2740"></span>[2741](#fn_2740.md)   In
like manner also, the spouse of a bishop (for the church is called his
spouse and wife) is bound to him while he liveth; but when he is dead
she is loosed, and may be wedded to whomsoever she will, only in the
Lord, that is, according to order.  For if, while he is alive, she marry
another, she shall be judged to be an adulteress.  And in the same
manner, he too, if he marry another of his own will, shall be held to be
an adulterer, and shall be deprived of the privilege of communion.  If,
however, he is persecuted in his own church, he must flee to another,
and attach himself to it, as the Lord says:  “If they persecute you in
one city, flee ye into another.” <span
id="fr_2741"></span>[2742](#fn_2741.md)   If, however, the change be made
for the sake of the good *of the church*, he may not do this of himself,
but only on the invitation of the brethren, and with the sanction of
this holy seat, and not for ambition’s sake, but for the public good.
