id="vi.iii.vi.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVI.—Why They Wish to Possess
Men.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.vi.xvi-p2"></span>“Now that the demons are desirous of
occupying the bodies of men, this is the reason.  They are spirits
having their purpose turned to wickedness.  Therefore by immoderate
eating and drinking, and lust, they urge men on to sin, but only those
who entertain the purpose of sinning, who, while they seem simply
desirous of satisfying the necessary cravings of nature, give
opportunity to the demons to enter into them, because through excess
they do not maintain moderation.  For as long as the measure of nature
is kept, and legitimate moderation is preserved, the mercy of God does
not give them liberty to enter into men.  But when either the mind falls
into impiety, or the body is filled with immoderate meat or drink, then,
as if invited by the will and purpose of those who thus neglect
themselves, they receive power as against those who have broken the law
imposed by God.
