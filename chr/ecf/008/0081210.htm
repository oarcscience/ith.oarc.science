<p class="c21"><a name="vii.v.xxxiii-p2"></A>After these things, Joseph and Mary departed thence with Jesus into the city of Nazareth; and He remained there with His parents.&#160; And on the first of the week, when Jesus was playing with the children on the roof of a certain house, it happened that one of the children pushed another down from the roof to the ground, and he was killed.&#160; And the parents of the dead boy, who had not seen this, cried out against Joseph and Mary, saying:&#160; Your son has thrown our son down to the ground, and he is dead.&#160; But Jesus was silent, and answered them nothing.&#160; And Joseph and Mary came in haste to Jesus; and His mother asked Him, saying:&#160; My lord, tell me if thou didst throw him down.&#160; And immediately Jesus went down from the roof to the ground, and called the boy by his name, Zeno.&#160; And he answered Him:&#160; My lord.&#160; And Jesus said to him:&#160; Was it I that threw thee down from the roof to the ground?&#160; And he said:&#160; No, my lord.&#160; And the parents of the boy who had been dead wondered, and honoured Jesus for the miracle that had been wrought.&#160; And Joseph and Mary departed thence with Jesus to Jericho.</p>
