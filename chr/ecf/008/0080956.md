id="vi.iv.xiv.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXII.—“The Gods that Have Not
Made the Heavens.”</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xiv.xxii-p2"></span>“For are not they graven with iron? 
And has not the graying iron been softened by fire?  And is not the fire
itself extinguished with water?  And has not the water its motion from
the spirit?  And has not the spirit the beginning of its course from the
God who hath made all things?  For thus said the prophet Moses:  ‘In the
beginning God made the heaven and the earth.  And the earth was
unsightly, and unadorned; and darkness was over the deep:  and the
Spirit of God was borne above the waters.’  Which Spirit, at the bidding
of God, as it were His hand, makes all things, dividing light from
darkness, and after the invisible heaven spreading out the visible, that
the places above might be inhabited by the angels of light, and those
below by man, and all the creatures that were made for his use.
