<span id="vi.iii.xi.xxx-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iii.xi.xxx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXX.—“Genesis” Inconsistent with
God’s Justice.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.xi.xxx-p2"></span>“Behold, from the very matter in
which we are now engaged <span id="fr_849"></span>[850](#fn_849.md) draw an
inference, and from the circumstances in which we are now placed deduce
a conclusion, how, through a rumour only <span id="page_190">p.
190</span> <span id="vi.iii.xi.xxx-Page_190"></span>reaching the ears of
men that a Prophet had appeared in Judæa to teach men with signs and
miracles to worship one God, all were expecting with prepared and eager
minds, even before the coming of my lord Peter, that some one would
announce to them what He taught who had appeared.  But lest I should
seem to carry the enumeration too far, I shall tell you what conclusion
ought to be drawn from the whole.  Since God is righteous, and since He
Himself made the nature of men, how could it be that He should place
<span class="c9"><span id="vi.iii.xi.xxx-p3.1"></span>Genesis</span> in
opposition to us, which should compel us to sin, and then that He should
punish us when we do sin?  Whence it is certain that God punishes no
sinner either in the present life or in that to come, except because He
knows that he could have conquered, but neglected victory.  For even in
the present world He takes vengeance upon men, as He did upon those who
perished in the deluge, who were all destroyed in one day, yea, in one
hour, although it is certain that they were not all born in one hour
according to the order of *genesis*.  But it is most absurd to say that
it befalls us by nature to suffer evils, if sins had not gone before.

a reference to the Prophet is much more dignified than the personal
boast of miraculous power which, in the *Homilies*, is placed in the
mouth of the Apostle just before the recognition.—R.\]
