id="vi.iv.xiv.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—Liberty and
Necessity.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xiv.viii-p2"></span>“But, you say, God ought to have
made us at first so that we should not have thought at all of such
things.  You who say this do not know what is free-will, and how it is
possible to be really good; that he who is good by his own choice is
really good; but he who is made good by another under necessity is not
really good, because he is not what he is by his own choice. <span
id="fr_1127"></span>[1128](#fn_1127)   Since therefore every one’s
freedom constitutes the true good, and shows the true evil, God has
contrived that friendship or hostility should be in each man by
occasions.  But no, it is said:  everything that we think He makes us to
think.  Stop!  Why do you blaspheme more and more, in saying this?  For
if we are under His influence in all that we think, you say that He is
the cause of fornications, lusts, avarice, and all blasphemy.  Cease
your evil-speaking, ye who ought to speak well of Him, and to bestow all
honour upon Him.  And do not say that God does not claim any honour; for
if He Himself claims nothing, you ought to look to what is right, and to
answer with thankful voice Him who does you good in all things.
