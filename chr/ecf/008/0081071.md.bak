id="vi.iv.xix.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIX.—The Shape of God in
Man.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xix.xix-p2"></span>And Simon said:  “I should like to
know, Peter, if you really believe that the shape of man has been
moulded after the shape of God.” <span
id="fr_1305"></span>[1306](#fn_1305.md)   And Peter said:  “I am really
quite certain, Simon, that this is the case.”  And Simon said:  “How can
death dissolve the body, impressed as it has thus been with the greatest
seal?”  And Peter said:  “It is the shape of the just God.  When, then,
the body begins to act unjustly, the form which is in it takes to
flight, and thus the body <span id="page_317">p. 317</span> <span
id="vi.iv.xix.xix-Page_317"></span>is dissolved, by the shape
disappearing, in order that an unjust body may not have the shape of the
just God.  The dissolution, however, does not take place in regard to
the seal, but in regard to the sealed body.  But that which is sealed is
not dissolved without Him who sealed it.  And thus it is not permitted
to die without judgment.”  And Simon said:  “What necessity was there to
give the shape of such a being to man, who was raised from the earth?” 
And Peter said:  “This was done because of the love of God, who made
man.  For while, as far as substance is concerned, all things are
superior to the flesh of man,—I mean the ether, the sun, the moon, the
stars, the air, the water, the fire—in a word, all the other things
which have been made for the service of man,—yet, though superior in
substance, they willingly endure to serve the inferior in substance,
because of the shape of the superior.  For as they who honour the clay
image of a king have paid honour to the king himself, whose shape the
clay happens to have, so the whole creation with joy serves man, who is
made from earth, looking to the honour thus paid to God.
