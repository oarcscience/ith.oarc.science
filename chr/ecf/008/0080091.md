id="vi.iii.iii.xxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIX.—The Giants:  the
Flood.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iii.xxix-p2"></span>“All things therefore being
completed which are in heaven, and in earth, and in the waters, and the
human race also having multiplied, in the eighth generation, righteous
men, who had lived the life of angels, being allured by the beauty of
women, fell into promiscuous and illicit connections with these; <span
id="fr_548"></span>[549](#fn_548.md) and thenceforth acting in all things
without discretion, and disorderly, they changed the state of human
affairs and the divinely prescribed order of life, so that either by
persuasion or force they compelled all men to sin against God their
Creator.  In the ninth generation are born the giants, so called from of
old, <span id="fr_549"></span>[550](#fn_549.md) not dragon-footed, as the
fables of the Greeks relate, but men of immense bodies, whose bones, of
enormous size, are still shown in some places for confirmation.  But
against these the righteous providence of God brought a flood upon the
world, that the earth might be purified from their pollution, and every
place might be turned into a sea by the destruction of the wicked.  Yet
there was then found one righteous man, by name Noah, who, being
delivered in an ark with his three sons and their wives, became the
colonizer of the world after the subsiding of the waters, with those
animals and seeds which he had shut up with him.”

<span id="vi.iii.iii.xxix-p4"></span> The writer here translates the
words of the Septuagint, of <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iii.iii.xxix-p4.1"></span>οἱ γίγαντες οἱ ἀπ᾽ αἰῶνος οἱ ἄνθρωποι
οἱ ὀνομαστοί</span>, illi qui a seculo nominantur.  We have given the
translation of our authorized version.  It is likely, however, that the
writer believed the name to imply that they lived to a great age, as is
maintained by Diodorus quoted by Suicer on the word, or he may have
traced the word to <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iii.iii.xxix-p4.2"></span>γῆ</span>.
