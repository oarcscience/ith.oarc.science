<span id="vi.iii.iii.xxviii-p2"></span>“After this He adorns that
visible heaven with stars.  He places in it also the sun and the moon,
that the day might enjoy the light of the one, the night that of the
other; and that at the same time they might be for an indication of
things past, present, and future.  For they were made for signs of
seasons and of days, which, although they are seen indeed by all, are
understood only by the learned and intelligent.  And when, after this,
He had ordered living creatures to be produced from the earth and the
waters, He made Paradise, which also He named a place of delights.  But
after all these things He made man, on whose account He had prepared all
things, whose internal species <span id="fr_547"></span>[548](#fn_547.md)
is older, and for whose sake all things that are were made, given up to
his service, and assigned to the uses of his habitation.”
