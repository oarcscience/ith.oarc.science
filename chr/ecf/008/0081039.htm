<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xvii.xii-p2"></A>When both were silent, I said:&#160; &#8220;Since I know accurately the science, but our lord and our father are not in this condition, I should like if Annubion himself were here, to have a discussion with him in the presence of my father.&#160; For thus would the matter be able to become public, when one practically acquainted with the subject has held the discussion with one equally informed.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1216"></A><A HREF="#fn_1216"><FONT SIZE="1">1217</FONT></A>
&#160; And our father answered:&#160; &#8220;Where, then, is it possible to fall in with Annubion?&#8221;&#160; And Peter said:&#160; &#8220;In Antioch, for I learn that Simon Magus is there, whose inseparable companion Annubion is.&#160; When, then, we go there, if we come upon them, the discussion can take place.&#8221;&#160; And so, when we had discussed many subjects, and rejoiced at the recognition and given thanks to God, evening came down upon us, and we turned to sleep.</p>
