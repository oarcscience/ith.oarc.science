<span id="vi.iii.vi.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iii.vi.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIV.—God Both Good and
Righteous.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.vi.xiv-p2"></span>“Hence, since so many false and
erratic religions have been introduced into the world, <span
id="fr_734"></span>[735](#fn_734.md) we have been sent, as good merchants,
bringing unto you the worship of the true God, handed down from the
fathers, and preserved; as the seeds of which we scatter these words
amongst you, and place it in your choice to choose what seems to you to
be right.  For if you receive those things which we bring you, you shall
not <span id="page_138">p. 138</span> <span
id="vi.iii.vi.xiv-Page_138"></span>only be able yourselves to escape the
incursions of the demon, but also to drive them away from others; and at
the same time you shall obtain the rewards of eternal good things.  But
those who shall refuse to receive those things which are spoken by us,
shall be subject in the present life to diverse demons and disorders of
sicknesses, and their souls after their departure from the body shall be
tormented for ever.  For God is not only good, but also just; for if He
were always good, and never just to render to every one according to his
deeds, goodness would be found to be injustice.  For it were injustice
if the impious and the pious were treated by Him alike.
