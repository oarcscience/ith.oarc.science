<span id="vi.iv.xx.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.xx.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIII.—The Evidence of the Senses
Contrasted with that from Supernatural Vision.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xx.xiii-p2"></span>Simon, on hearing this, interrupted
him, and said:  “I know against whom you are making these remarks; but
in order that I may not spend any time in discussing subjects which I do
not wish to discuss, repeating the same statements to refute you, reply
to that which is concisely stated by us.  You professed that you had
well understood the doctrines and deeds <span
id="fr_1345"></span>[1346](#fn_1345.md) of your teacher because you saw
them before you with your own eyes, <span
id="fr_1346"></span>[1347](#fn_1346.md) and heard them with your <span
id="page_322">p. 322</span> <span id="vi.iv.xx.xiii-Page_322"></span>own
ears, and that it is not possible for any other to have anything similar
by vision or apparition.  But I shall show that this is false.  He who
hears any one with his own ears, is not altogether fully assured of the
truth of what is said; for his mind has to consider whether he is wrong
or not, inasmuch as he is a man as far as appearance goes.  But
apparition not merely presents an object to view, but inspires him who
sees it with confidence, for it comes from God.  Now reply first to
this.” <span id="fr_1347"></span>[1348](#fn_1347.md)

<span id="vi.iv.xx.xiii-p4"></span> The <span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iv.xx.xiii-p4.1"></span>mss.</span> have here <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.iv.xx.xiii-p4.2"></span>ἐνεργείᾳ</span>,
“activity.”  This has been amended into <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.xx.xiii-p4.3"></span>ἐναργείᾳ</span>, “with plainness, with
distinctness.”  <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.xx.xiii-p4.4"></span>᾽Ενάργεια</span> is used throughout in
opposition to <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.xx.xiii-p4.5"></span>ὀπτασία</span>, <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.xx.xiii-p4.6"></span>ὅραμα</span>, and <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.iv.xx.xiii-p4.7"></span>ἐνύπνιον</span>, and
means the act of seeing and hearing by our own senses in plain daylight,
when to doubt the fact observed is to doubt the senses; <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.iv.xx.xiii-p4.8"></span>ὀπτασία</span> is
apparition or vision in ecstasy, or some extraordinary way but that of
sleep; <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.xx.xiii-p4.9"></span>ὅραμα</span> and <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.iv.xx.xiii-p4.10"></span>ἐνύπνιον</span> are
restricted to visions in sleep.  The last term implies this.  The first
means simply “a thing seen.”

<span id="vi.iv.xx.xiii-p5"></span> \[Comp. *Recognitions*, ii. 50, 51,
61–65.  The emphasis laid upon supernatural visions in the remainder of
the Homily has been supposed to convey an insinuation against the
revelations to the Apostle Paul.—R.\]
