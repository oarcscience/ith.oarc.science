id="vi.iv.xxiii.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II.—The Two Ages.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxiii.ii-p2"></span>And Peter said:  “Listen, therefore,
to the truth of the harmony in regard to the evil one.  God appointed
two kingdoms, and established two ages, determining that the present
world should be given to the evil one, because it is small, and passes
quickly away; but He promised to preserve for the good one the age to
come, as it will be great and eternal.  Man, therefore, He created with
free-will, and possessing the capability of inclining to whatever
actions he wishes.  And his body consists of three parts, deriving its
origin from the female; for it has lust, anger, and grief, and what is
consequent on these.  But the spirit not being uniform, <span
id="fr_1479"></span>[1480](#fn_1479.md) but consisting of three parts,
derives its origin from the male; and it is capable of reasoning,
knowledge, and fear, and what is consequent on these.  And each of these
triads has one root, so that man is a compound of two mixtures, the
female and the male.  Wherefore also two ways have been laid before
him—those of obedience and disobedience to law; and two kingdoms, have
been established,—the one called <span
id="fr_1480"></span>[1481](#fn_1480.md) the kingdom of heaven, and the
other the kingdom of those who are now kings upon earth.  Also two kings
have been appointed, of whom the one is selected to rule by law over the
present and transitory world, and his composition is such that he
rejoices in the destruction of the wicked.  But the other and good <span
id="fr_1481"></span>[1482](#fn_1481.md) one, who is the King of the age to
come, loves the whole nature of man; but not being able to have boldness
in the present world, he counsels what is advantageous, like one who
tries to conceal who he really is. <span
