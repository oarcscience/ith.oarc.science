Again.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.xii.lxvii-p2"></span>Whilst he made these and similar
statements, the people began to curse him, and to weep and lament
because they had sinned against Peter, believing him to be a magician or
wicked man.  But the same day, at evening, Faustinianus had his own face
restored to him, and the appearance of Simon Magus left him.  Now Simon,
hearing that his face on Faustinianus had contributed to the glory of
Peter, came in haste to anticipate Peter, and intending to cause by his
art that his likeness should be taken from Faustinianus, when Christ had
already accomplished this according to the word of His apostle.  But
Niceta and Aquila, seeing their father’s face restored after the
necessary proclamation, gave thanks to God, and would not suffer him to
address the people any more.
