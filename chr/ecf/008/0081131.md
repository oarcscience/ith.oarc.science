<span id="vi.iv.xxii.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.xxii.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII.—God Produced the Wicked
One, But Not Evil.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxii.xii-p2"></span>And Simon said:  “If, then, God is
the cause only of what is good, what else can we think than that some
other principle begot the evil one; <span
id="fr_1426"></span>[1427](#fn_1426) or is evil unbegotten?”  And Peter
said:  “No other power begot the wicked one, nor is evil unbegotten, as
I shall show in the conclusion; for now my object is to prove, as I
promised in the commencement, that God is blameless in every <span
id="fr_1427"></span>[1428](#fn_1427) respect.  We have granted, then,
that God possesses in an incomparable way the better attributes that
belong to men.  Wherefore also it is possible for Him to have been the
producer of the four substances,—heat, I mean, and cold, moist and dry. 
These, as being at first simple and unmixed, were naturally indifferent
in their desire; <span id="fr_1428"></span>[1429](#fn_1428) but being
produced by God, and mixed externally, they would naturally become a
living being, possessing the free choice to destroy those who are evil. 
And thus, since all things have been begotten from Him, the wicked one
is from no other source.  Nor has he derived his evil from the God who
has created all things (with whom it is impossible that evil should
exist), because the substances were produced by Him in a state of
indifference, and carefully separated from each other; and when they
were externally blended through his art, there arose through volition
the desire for the destruction of the evil ones.  But the good cannot be
destroyed by the evil that arose, even though it should wish to do so: 
for it exercises its power only <span
id="fr_1429"></span>[1430](#fn_1429) against those who sin.  Ignorant,
then, of the character of each, <span
id="fr_1430"></span>[1431](#fn_1430) he makes his attempt against him,
and convicting him, he punishes him.”  And Simon said:  “God being able
to mingle the elements, and to make His mixtures so as to produce any
dispositions that He may wish, why did He not make the composition of
each such as that it would prefer what is good?”
