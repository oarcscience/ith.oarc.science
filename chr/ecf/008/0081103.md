id="vi.iv.xxi.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—The Work of Revelation
Belongs to the Son Alone.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxi.viii-p2"></span>And Peter said:  “Since, at least in
appearance, you have confessed that you do not understand it, reply to
the question I put to you, and you will learn the meaning of the
statement.  Tell me, do you maintain that the Son, whoever he be, is
just, or that he is not just?”  And Simon said:  “I maintain that he is
most just.”  And Peter said:  “Seeing He is just, why does He not make
the revelation to all, but only to those to whom He wishes?”  And Simon
said:  “Because, being just, he wishes to make the revelation only to
the worthy.”  And Peter said:  “Must He not therefore know the mind of
each one, in order that He may make the revelation to the worthy?”  And
Simon said:  “Of course he must.”  And Peter said:  “With reason,
therefore, has the work of giving the revelation been confined to Him
alone, for He alone knows the mind of every one; and it has not been
given to you, who are not able to understand even that which is stated
by us.”
