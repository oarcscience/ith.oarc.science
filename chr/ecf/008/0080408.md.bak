<span id="vi.iii.x.ii-p2"></span>Then the old man proceeded to say:  “I
saw you bathe in the sea, and afterwards retire into a secret place;
wherefore observing, without your noticing me, what you were doing, I
saw you praying.  Therefore, pitying your error, I waited till you came
out, that I might speak to you, and instruct you not to err in an
observance of this sort; because there is neither any God, nor any
worship, neither is there any providence in the world, but all things
are done by fortuitous chance and *genesis*, as I have discovered most
clearly for myself, being accomplished beyond others in the discipline
of learning. <span id="fr_806"></span>[807](#fn_806.md)   Do not err,
therefore:  for whether you pray, or whether you do not pray, whatever
your *genesis* contains, that shall befall you.”  Then I Clement was
affected, I know not how, in my heart, recollecting many things in him
that seemed familiar to me; for some one says well, that that which is
sprung from any one, although it may be long absent, yet a spark of
relationship is never extinguished. <span
id="fr_807"></span>[808](#fn_807.md)   Therefore I began to ask of him who
and whence he was, and how descended.  But he, not wishing to answer
these questions, said:  “What has that to do with what I have told you? 
But first, if you please, let us converse of those matters which we have
propounded; and afterwards, if circumstances require, we can disclose to
one another, as friends to friends, our names, and families, and
country, and other things connected with these.”  Yet we all admired the
eloquence of the man, and the gravity of his manners, and the calmness
of his speech.
