<span id="vi.iv.ix.i-p3"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iv.ix.i-p3.1"></span>And</span> on the third day, when I came
with my friends to the appointed place in Tyre, I found Appion sitting
between Anubion and Athenodorus, and waiting for us, along with many
other learned men.  But in no wise dismayed, I greeted them, and sat
down opposite Appion.  And in a little he began to speak:—

<span id="vi.iv.ix.i-p4"></span>“I wish to start from the following
point, and to come with all speed at once to the question.  Before you,
my son Clement, joined us, my friend Anubion here, and Athenodorus, who
yesterday were among those who heard you discourse, were reporting to me
what you said of the numerous false accusations I brought against the
gods when I was visiting you in Rome, at the time you were shamming
love, how I charged them with pæderasty, lasciviousness, and numerous
incests of all kinds.  But, my son, you ought to have known that I was
not in earnest when I wrote such things about the gods, but was
concealing the truth, from my love to you.  That truth, however, if it
so please you, you may hear from me now.
