id="vi.iv.xv.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II.—Love of Preachers and Their
Converts.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xv.ii-p2"></span>“I know, indeed, that you are
distressed at being told to do this, being separated from me by a space
of two days.  I would have you know, therefore, that we the persuaders
love you the persuaded much more than you love us who have persuaded
you.  Therefore loving one another as we do by not unreasonably doing
what we wish, let us provide, as much as in us lies, for safety.  For I
prefer, as you also know, to go into the more notable cities of the
provinces, and to remain some days, and discourse.  And for the present
lead the way into the neighbouring Laodicea, and, after two or three
days, so far as it depends upon my choice, I shall overtake you.  And do
you alone receive me at the gates, on account of the confusion, that
thus we may enter along with you without tumult.  And thence, in like
manner, after some days’ stay, others in your stead will go forward by
turns to the places beyond, preparing lodgings for us.”
