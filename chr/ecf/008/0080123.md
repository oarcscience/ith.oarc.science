<span id="vi.iii.iii.lxi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iii.iii.lxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter LXI.—Caiaphas Answered.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iii.lxi-p2"></span>“Then Caiaphas attempted to impugn
the doctrine of Jesus, saying that He spoke vain things, for He said
that the poor are blessed; <span id="fr_590"></span>[591](#fn_590.md) and
promised earthly rewards; and placed the chief gift in an earthly
inheritance; and promised that those who maintain righteousness shall be
satisfied with meat and drink; and many things of this sort He is
charged with teaching.  Thomas, in reply, proves that his accusation is
frivolous; showing that the prophets, in whom Caiaphas believes, taught
these things much more, and did not show in what manner these things are
to be, or how they are to be understood; whereas Jesus pointed out how
they are to be taken.  And when he had spoken these things, and others
of like kind, Thomas also held his peace.”
