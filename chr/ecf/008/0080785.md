<span id="vi.iv.vii.xxiv-p2"></span>When Appion heard this, he said:  “I
knew, ever since I heard that you were consorting with Jews, that you
had alienated your judgment.  For it has been well said by some one,
‘Evil communications corrupt good manners.’”  Then said I:  “Therefore
good communications correct evil manners.”  And Appion said:  “Today I
am fully satisfied to have learned your position; therefore I permitted
you to speak first.  But to-morrow, in this place, if it is agreeable to
you, I will show, in the presence of these friends when they meet, that
our gods are neither adulterers, nor murderers, nor corrupters of
children, nor guilty of incest with sisters or daughters.  But the
ancients, wishing that only lovers of learning should know the
mysteries, veiled them with those fables of which you have spoken.  For
they speak physiologically of boiling substance under the name of Zen,
and of time under that of Kronos, and of the ever-flowing nature of
water under that of Rhea.  However, as I have promised, I shall
to-morrow exhibit the truth of things, explaining them one by one to you
when you come together in the morning.” <span

“To-morrow, as you have promised, so do.  But now hear something in
opposition to what you are going to say.
