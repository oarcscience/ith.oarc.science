&#160; &#8220;We have no need of your peace; for if there be peace and con<A NAME="page_104"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 104</FONT></A> <a name="vi.iii.iv.xxiii-Page_104"></A>cord, we shall not be able to make any advance towards the discovery of truth.&#160; For robbers and debauchees have peace among themselves, and every wickedness agrees with itself; and if we have met with this view, that for the sake of peace we should give assent to all that is said, we shall confer no benefit upon the hearers; but, on the contrary, we shall impose upon them, and shall depart friends.&#160; Wherefore, do not invoke peace, but rather battle, which is the mother of peace; and if you can, exterminate errors.&#160; And do not seek for friendship obtained by unfair admissions; for this I would have you know, above all, that when two fight with each other, then there will be peace when one has been defeated and has fallen.&#160; And therefore fight as best you can, and do not expect peace without war, which is impossible; or if it can be attained, show us how.&#8221;</p>
