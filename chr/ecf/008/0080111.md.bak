id="vi.iii.iii.xlix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLIX.—Two Comings of
Christ.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iii.xlix-p2"></span>“His coming, therefore, was
predicted by Moses, who delivered the law of God to men; but by another
also before him, as I have already informed you.  He therefore intimated
that He should come, humble indeed in His first coming, but glorious in
His second.  And the first, indeed, has been already accomplished; since
He has come and taught, and He, the Judge of all, has been judged and
slain.  But at His second coming He shall come to judge, and shall
indeed condemn the wicked, but shall take the pious into a share and
association with Himself in His kingdom.  Now the faith of His second
coming depends upon His first.  For the prophets—especially Jacob and
Moses—spoke of the first, but some also of the second.  But the
excellency of prophecy is chiefly shown in this, that the prophets spoke
not of things to come, according to the sequence of things; otherwise
they might seem merely as wise men to have conjectured what the sequence
of things pointed out.”
