id="vi.iv.vi.lix-p1.1"></span>Chapter LIX.—Peter’s Resolution to
Follow.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.vi.lix-p2"></span>Peter, hearing this, on the following
night assembled the multitude of hearers; and as soon as they were come
together, he said:  “While I am going forth to the nations which say
that there are many gods, to teach and to preach that God is one, who
made heaven and earth, and all things that are in them, in order that
they may love Him and be saved, evil has anticipated me, and by the very
law of conjunction has sent Simon before me, in order that these men, if
they shall cease to say that there are many gods, disowning those upon
earth that are called gods, may think that there are many gods in
heaven; so that, not feeling the excellency of the monarchy, they may
perish with eternal punishment.  And what is most dreadful, since true
doctrine has incomparable power, he forestalls me with slanders, and
persuades them to this, not even at first to receive me; lest he who is
the slanderer be convicted of being himself in reality a devil, and the
true doctrine be received and believed.  Therefore I must quickly catch
him up, lest the false accusation, through gaining time, wholly get hold
of all men.
