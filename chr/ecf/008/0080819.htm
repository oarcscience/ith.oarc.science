<p class="c22"><a name="vi.iv.ix.i-p4"></A>&#8220;I wish to start from the following point, and to come with all speed at once to the question.&#160; Before you, my son Clement, joined us, my friend Anubion here, and Athenodorus, who yesterday were among those who heard you discourse, were reporting to me what you said of the numerous false accusations I brought against the gods when I was visiting you in Rome, at the time you were shamming love, how I charged them with p&aelig;derasty, lasciviousness, and numerous incests of all kinds.&#160; But, my son, you ought to have known that I was not in earnest when I wrote such things about the gods, but was concealing the truth, from my love to you.&#160; That truth, however, if it so please you, you may hear from me now.</p>
