id="vi.iii.v.xxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXVI.—Self-Evidence of the
Truth.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.v.xxvi-p2"></span>Then said Peter:  “If indeed one hear
in an orderly and regular manner he is able to know what is true; but he
who refuses to submit to the rule of a reformed life and a pure
conversation, which truly is the proper result of knowledge of the
truth, will not confess that he knows what he does know.  For this is
exactly what we see in the case of some who, abandoning the trades which
they learned in their youth, betake themselves to other performances,
and by way of excusing their own sloth, begin to find fault with the
trade as unprofitable.”  Then Simon:  “Ought all who hear to believe
that whatever they hear is true?”  Then Peter:  “Whoever hears an
orderly statement of the truth, cannot by any means gainsay it, but
knows that what is spoken is true, provided he also willingly submit to
the rules of life.  But those who, when they hear, are unwilling to
betake themselves to good works, are prevented by the desire of doing
evil from acquiescing in those things which they judge to be right. 
Hence it is manifest that it is in the power of the hearers to choose
which of the two they prefer.  But if all who hear were to obey, it
would be rather a necessity of nature, leading all in one way.  For as
no one can be persuaded to become shorter or taller, because the force
of nature does not permit it; so also, if either all were converted to
the truth by a word, or all were not <span id="page_124">p. 124</span>
<span id="vi.iii.v.xxvi-Page_124"></span>converted, it would be the
force of nature which compelled all in the one case, and none at all in
the other, to be converted.”
