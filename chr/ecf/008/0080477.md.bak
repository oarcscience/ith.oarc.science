<span id="vi.iii.xi.viii-p2"></span>“But perhaps you will say, that in
those things indeed in which the necessity of nature demands the service
of arts and works, any one may have it in his power to maintain justice,
and to put what restraint he pleases either upon his desires or his
actions; but what shall we say of the sicknesses and infirmities which
befall men, and of some being harassed with demons, and fevers, and cold
fits, and some being attacked with madness, or losing their reason, and
all those things which overwhelm the race of man with innumerable
misfortunes?  To this we say, that if any one consider the reason of the
whole mystery, he will pronounce these things to be more just than those
that we have already explained.  For God has given a nature to men, by
which they may be taught concerning what is good, and to resist evil;
that is, they may learn arts, and to resist pleasures, and to set the
law of God before them in all things.  And for this end He has permitted
certain contrary powers to wander up and down in the world, and to
strive against us, <span id="fr_839"></span>[840](#fn_839.md) for the
reasons which have been stated before, that by striving with them the
palm of victory and the merit of rewards may accrue to the righteous.
