<span id="vi.iv.xxi.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.xxi.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIII.—Peter’s Explanation of the
Passage.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxi.xiii-p2"></span>And Peter said:  “I shall reply to
that which you wish me to speak of,—namely, the passage, ‘No one knows
the Father but the Son, nor does any one know the Son but the Father,
and they to <span id="page_328">p. 328</span> <span
id="vi.iv.xxi.xiii-Page_328"></span>whom the Son may wish to reveal
Him.’  First, then, I am astonished that, while this statement admits of
countless interpretations, you should have chosen the very dangerous
position of maintaining that the statement is made in reference to the
ignorance of the Creator (Demiurge), and all who are under him.  For,
first, the statement can apply to all the Jews who think that David is
the father of Christ, and that Christ himself is his son, and do not
know that He is the Son of God.  Wherefore it is appropriately said, ‘No
one knows the Father,’ since, instead of God, they affirmed David to be
His father; and the additional remark, that no one knows even the Son,
is quite correct, since they did not know that He was the Son.  The
statement also, ‘to whomsoever the Son may wish to reveal Him,’ is also
correct; for He being the Son from the beginning, was alone appointed to
give the revelation to those to whom He wishes to give it.  And thus the
first man (protoplast) Adam must have heard of Him; and Enoch, who
pleased *God*, must have known Him; and Noah, the righteous one, must
have become acquainted with Him; and Abraam His friend must have
understood Him; and Isaac must have perceived Him; and Jacob, who
wrestled with Him, must have believed in Him; and the revelation must
have been given to all among the people who were worthy.
