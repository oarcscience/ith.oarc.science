<span id="vi.iv.xvi.i-p3"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iv.xvi.i-p3.1"></span>Now</span> at break of day Peter entered,
and said: <span id="fr_1156"></span>[1157](#fn_1156)   “Clement, and his
mother Mattidia, and my wife, must take their seats immediately on the
waggon.”  And so they did straightway.  And as we were hastening along
the road to Balanæae, my mother asked me how my father was; and I said: 
“My father went in search of you, and of my twin brothers Faustinus and
Faustinianus, and is now nowhere to be found.  But I fancy he must have
died long ago, either perishing by shipwreck, or losing his way, <span
id="fr_1157"></span>[1158](#fn_1157) or wasted away by grief.”  When she
heard this, she burst into tears, and groaned through grief; but the joy
which she felt at finding me, mitigated in some degree the painfulness
of her recollections.  And so we all went down together to Balanæae. 
And on the following day we went to Paltus, and from that to Gabala; and
on the next day we reached Laodicea.  And, lo! before the gates of the
city Nicetas and Aquila met us, and embracing us, brought us to our
lodging.  Now Peter, seeing that the city was beautiful and great,
said:  “It is worth our while to stay here for some days; for, generally
speaking, a populous place is most capable of yielding us those whom we
seek.” <span id="fr_1158"></span>[1159](#fn_1158)   Nicetas and Aquila
asked me who that strange woman was; and I said:  “My mother, whom God,
through my lord Peter, has granted me to recognise.”
