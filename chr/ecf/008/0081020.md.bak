id="vi.iv.xvi.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XV.—Peter’s Speech
Continued.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xvi.xv-p2"></span>“The chaste wife doing the will of
God, is a good reminiscence of His first creation; for God, being one,
created one woman for one man.  She is also still more chaste if she
does not forget her own creation, and has future punishment before her
eyes, and is not ignorant of the loss of eternal blessings.  The chaste
woman takes pleasure in those who wish to be saved, and is a pious
example to the pious, for she is the model of a good life.  She who
wishes to be chaste, cuts off all occasions for slander; but if she be
slandered as by an enemy, though affording him no pretext, she is
blessed and avenged by God.  The chaste woman longs for God, loves God,
pleases God, glorifies God; and to men she affords no occasion for
slander.  The chaste woman perfumes the Church with her good reputation,
and glorifies it by her piety.  She is, moreover, the praise of her
teachers, and a helper to them in their chastity. <span
