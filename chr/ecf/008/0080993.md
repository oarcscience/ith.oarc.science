<span id="vi.iv.xv.xxii-p2"></span>Peter, therefore, took her by the
hand, and led her to the boat.  But I, when I saw him leading the woman
by the hand, laughed, and approaching, offered to lead her instead of
him, to his honour.  But as soon as I touched her hand, she gave a
motherly shout, and embraced me violently, and eagerly kissed me as her
son.  But I, being ignorant of the whole affair, shook her off as a
madwoman.  But, through my respect for Peter, I checked myself.
