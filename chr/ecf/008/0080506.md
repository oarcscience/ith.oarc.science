id="vi.iii.xi.xxxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXVII.—Another
Recognition.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.xi.xxxvii-p2"></span>But while Peter was detailing
these things in the hearing of the old man, in a narrative which was
most pleasing to the crowd, so that the hearers wept through wonder at
the events, and through compassion for sufferings incident to
humanity, <span id="fr_853"></span>[854](#fn_853.md) my mother, hearing (I
know not how) of the recognition of my father, rushed into the middle of
us in breathless haste, crying out, and saying:  “Where is my husband,
my lord Faustinianus, who has been so long afflicted, wandering from
city to city in search of me?”  While she shouted thus like one
demented, and gazed around, the old man, running up, began to embrace
and hug her with many tears. <span id="fr_854"></span>[855](#fn_854.md)  
And while these things were going on, Peter requested the crowds to
disperse, saying that it was unseemly to remain longer; but that
opportunity must be afforded them of seeing one another more privately. 
“But to-morrow,” said he, “if any of you wish it, let them assemble to
hear the word.”
