<span id="v.iv.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.—Conduct of the Holy Man Where There
are Women Only.</span>

<span id="v.iv.iv-p2"></span>But if we chance to come into a place where
there are no *Christian* men, but all the believers are women and
maidens, <span id="fr_447"></span>[448](#fn_447.md) and they press us to
pass the night there in that place, we call them all together to some
suitable place, <span id="fr_448"></span>[449](#fn_448.md) and ask them how
they do; and according to that which we learn from them, and what we see
to be their state of mind, we address them in a suitable manner, as men
fearing God.  And when they have all assembled and come *together*, and
we see that they are in peace, <span id="fr_449"></span>[450](#fn_449.md)
we address to them words of exhortation in the fear of God, and read the
Scripture to them, with purity and in the concise <span
id="fr_450"></span>[451](#fn_450.md) and weighty words of the fear of God. 
We do everything as for their edification.  And as to those who are
married, we speak to them in the Lord in a manner suited to them.  And
if, moreover, the day decline and the eventide draw on, we select, in
order to pass the night there, a woman who is aged and the most
exemplary <span id="fr_451"></span>[452](#fn_451.md) of them all; and we
speak to her to give us a place all to ourselves, where no woman enters,
nor maiden.  And this old woman herself will bring us a lamp, and
whatever is requisite for us she will herself bring us.  From love to
the brethren, she will bring whatever is requisite for the service of
stranger brethren.  And she herself, when the time for sleep is come,
will depart and go to her house in peace.
