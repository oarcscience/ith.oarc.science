Search.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xv.xvii-p2"></span>“But when the day dawned, I shouted
aloud, and howled miserably, and looked around, seeking for the dead
bodies of my hapless children.  Therefore the inhabitants took pity on
me, and seeing me naked, they first clothed me and then sounded the
deep, seeking for my children.  And when they found nothing of what they
sought, some of the hospitable women came to me to comfort me, and every
one told her own misfortunes, that I might obtain comfort from the
occurrences of similar misfortunes.  But this only grieved me the more
for I said that I was not so wicked that I could take comfort from the
misfortunes of others.  And so, when many of them asked me to accept
their hospitality, a certain poor woman with much urgency constrained me
to come into her cottage, saying to me, ‘Take courage, woman, for my
husband, who was a sailor, also died at sea, while he was still in the
bloom of his youth; and ever since, though many have asked me in
marriage, I have preferred living as a widow, regretting the loss of my
husband.  But we shall have in common whatever we can both earn with our
hands.’
