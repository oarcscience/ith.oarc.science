Time.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.viii.ii-p2"></span>When he had said this, as very many
had already assembled in the accustomed place of the garden to hear him,
Peter went forth; and having saluted the crowds in his usual manner,
began to speak as follows: <span id="fr_775"></span>[776](#fn_775.md)  
“Since, indeed, as land neglected by the cultivator necessarily produces
thorns and thistles, so your sense, by long neglect, has produced a
plentiful crop of noxious opinions of things and dogmas of false
science; there is need now of much care in cultivating the field of your
mind, that the word of truth, which is the true and diligent husbandman
of the heart, may cultivate it with continual instructions.  It is
therefore your part to render obedience to it, and to lop off
superfluous occupations and anxieties, lest a noxious growth choke the
good seed of the word.  For it may be that a short and earnest diligence
may repair a long time’s neglect; for the time of every one’s life is
uncertain, and therefore we must hasten to salvation, lest haply sudden
death seize upon him who delays.
