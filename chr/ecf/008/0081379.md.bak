the Theologian.</span>

<span id="vii.xxxvii-p2"></span><span class="c6"><span
id="vii.xxxvii-p2.1"></span>About His Exile and Departure.</span>

<span id="vii.xxxvii-p3"></span> ————————————

<span id="vii.xxxvii-p4"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.xxxvii-p4.1"></span>When</span> Agrippa, whom, on account of his
plotting against Peace, they stoned and put to death, was king of the
Jews, Vespasian Cæsar, coming with a great army, invested Jerusalem; and
some prisoners of war he took and slew, others he destroyed by famine in
the siege, and most he banished, and at length scattered up and down. 
And having destroyed the temple, and put the holy vessels on board a
ship, he sent them to Rome, to make for himself a temple of peace, and
adorned it with the spoils of war.

<span id="vii.xxxvii-p5"></span>And when Vespasian was dead, his son
Domitian, having got possession of the kingdom, along with his other
wrongful acts, set himself also to make a persecution against the
righteous men.  For, having learned that the city was filled with Jews,
remembering the orders given by his father about them, he purposed
casting them all out of the city of the Romans.  And some of the Jews
took courage, and gave Domitian a book, in which was written as
follows:—

<span id="vii.xxxvii-p6"></span>O Domitian, Cæsar and king of all the
world, as many of us as are Jews entreat thee, as suppliants we beseech
of thy power not to banish us from thy divine and benignant countenance;
for we are obedient to thee, and the customs, and laws, and practices,
and policy, doing wrong in nothing, but being of the same mind with the
Romans.  But there is a new and strange nation, neither agreeing with
other nations nor consenting to the religious observances of the Jews,
uncircumcised, inhuman, lawless, subverting whole houses, proclaiming a
man as God, all assembling together <span
id="fr_2434"></span>[2435](#fn_2434.md) under a strange name, that of
Christian.  These men reject God, paying no heed to the law given by
Him, and proclaim to be the Son of God a man born of ourselves, Jesus by
name, whose parents and brothers and all his family have been connected
with the Hebrews; whom on account of his great blasphemy and his wicked
fooleries we gave up to the cross.  And they add another blasphemous lie
to their first one:  him that was nailed up and buried, they glorify as
having risen from the dead; and, more than this, they falsely assert
that he has been taken up by <span id="fr_2435"></span>[2436](#fn_2435.md)
clouds into the heavens.

<span id="vii.xxxvii-p9"></span>At all this the king, being affected
with rage, ordered the senate to publish a decree that they should put
to death all who confessed themselves to be Christians.  Those, then,
who were found in the time of his rage, and who reaped the fruit of
patience, and were crowned in the triumphant contest against the works
of the devil, received the repose of incorruption.

<span id="vii.xxxvii-p10"></span>And the fame of the teaching of John
was spread abroad in Rome; and it came to the ears of Domitian that
there was a certain Hebrew in Ephesus, John by name, who spread a report
about the seat of empire of the Romans, saying that it would quickly be
rooted out, and that the kingdom of the Romans would be given over to
another.  And Domitian, troubled by what was said, sent a centurion with
soldiers to seize John, and bring him.  And having gone to Ephesus, they
asked where John lived.  And having come up to his gate, they found him
standing before the door; and, thinking that he was the porter, they
inquired of him where John lived.  And he answered and said:  I am he. 
And they, despising his common, and low, and poor appearance, were
filled with threats, and said:  Tell us the truth.  And when he declared
again that he was the man they sought, the neighbours moreover bearing
witness to it, they said that he was to go with them at once to the king
in Rome.  And, urging them to take provisions for the journey, he turned
and took a few dates, and straightway went forth.

<span id="vii.xxxvii-p11"></span>And the soldiers, having taken the
public conveyances, travelled fast, having seated him in the midst of
them.  And when they came to the first change, it being the hour of
breakfast, they <span id="page_561">p. 561</span> <span
id="vii.xxxvii-Page_561"></span>entreated him to be of good courage, and
to take bread, and eat with them.  And John said:  I rejoice in soul
indeed, but in the meantime I do not wish to take any food.  And they
started, and were carried along quickly.  And when it was evening they
stopped at a certain inn; and as, besides, it was the hour of supper,
the centurion and the soldiers being most kindly disposed, entreated
John to make use of what was set before them.  But he said that he was
very tired, and in want of sleep more than any food.  And as he did this
each day, all the soldiers were struck with amazement, and were afraid
lest John should die, and involve them in danger.  But the Holy Spirit
showed him to them as more cheerful.  And on the seventh day, it being
the Lord’s day, he said to them:  Now it is time for me also to partake
of food.  And having washed his hands and face, he prayed, and brought
out the linen cloth, and took one of the dates, and ate it in the sight
of all.

<span id="vii.xxxvii-p12"></span>And when they had ridden a long time
they came to the end of their journey, John thus fasting.  And they
brought him before the king, and said:  Worshipful king, we bring to
thee John, a god, not a man; for, from the hour in which we apprehended
him, to the present, he has not tasted bread.  At this Domitian being
amazed, stretched out his mouth on account of the wonder, wishing to
salute him with a kiss; but John bent down his head, and kissed his
breast.  And Domitian said:  Why hast thou done this?  Didst thou not
think me worthy to kiss thee?  And John said to him:  It is right to
adore the hand of God first of all, and in this way to kiss the mouth of
the king; for it is written in the holy books, The heart of a king is in
the hand of God. <span id="fr_2436"></span>[2437](#fn_2436.md)

<span id="vii.xxxvii-p14"></span>And the king said to him:  Art thou
John, who said that my kingdom would speedily be uprooted, and that
another king, Jesus, was going to reign instead of me?  And John
answered and said to him:  Thou also shalt reign for many years given
thee by God, and after thee very many others; and when the times of the
things upon earth have been fulfilled, out of heaven shall come a King,
eternal, true, Judge of living and dead, to whom every nation and tribe
shall confess, through whom every earthly power and dominion shall be
brought to nothing, and every mouth speaking great things shall be
shut.  This is the mighty Lord and King of everything that hath breath
and flesh, <span id="fr_2437"></span>[2438](#fn_2437.md) the Word and Son
of the living One, who is Jesus Christ.

<span id="vii.xxxvii-p16"></span>At this Domitian said to him:  What is
the proof of these things?  I am not persuaded by words only; words are
a sight of the unseen. <span id="fr_2438"></span>[2439](#fn_2438.md)   What
canst thou show in earth or heaven by the power of him who is destined
to reign, as thou sayest?  For he will do it, if he is the Son of God. 
And immediately John asked for a deadly poison.  And the king having
ordered poison to be given to him, they brought it on the instant.  John
therefore, having taken it, put it into a large cup, and filled it with
water, and mixed it, and cried out with a loud voice, and said:  In Thy
name, Jesus Christ, Son of God, I drink the cup which Thou wilt sweeten;
and the poison in it do Thou mingle with Thy Holy Spirit, and make it
become a draught of life and salvation, for the healing of soul and
body, for digestion and harmless assimilation, for faith not to be
repented of, for an undeniable testimony of death as the cup of
thanksgiving. <span id="fr_2439"></span>[2440](#fn_2439.md)   And when he
had drunk the cup, those standing beside Domitian expected that he was
going to fall to the ground in convulsions.  And when John stood,
cheerful, and talked with them safe, Domitian was enraged against those
who had given the poison, as having spared John.  But they swore by the
fortune and health of the king, and said that there could not be a
stronger poison than this.  And John, understanding what they were
whispering to one another, said to the king:  Do not take it ill, O
king, but let a trial be made, <span
id="fr_2440"></span>[2441](#fn_2440.md) and thou shalt learn the power of
the poison.  Make some condemned criminal be brought from the prison. 
And when he had come, John put water into the cup, and swirled it round,
and gave it with all the dregs to the condemned criminal.  And he,
having taken it and drunk, immediately fell down and died.

<span id="vii.xxxvii-p20"></span>And when all wondered at the signs that
had been done, and when Domitian had retired and gone to his palace,
John said to him:  O Domitian, king of the Romans, didst thou contrive
this, that, thou being present and bearing witness, I might to-day
become a murderer?  What is to be done about the dead body which is
lying?  And he ordered it to be taken and thrown away.  But John, going
up to the dead body, said:  O God, Maker of the heavens, Lord and Master
of angels, of glories, of powers, in the name of Jesus Christ, Thine
only begotten Son, give to this man who has died for this occasion a
renewal of life, and restore him his soul, that Domitian may learn that
the Word is much more powerful than poison, and is the ruler of life. 
And having taken him by the hand, he raised him up alive.

<span id="vii.xxxvii-p21"></span>And when all were glorifying God, and
wondering at the faith of John, Domitian said to him:  I have put forth
a decree of the senate, that all such persons should be summarily dealt
with, without trial; but since I find from thee <span id="page_562">p.
562</span> <span id="vii.xxxvii-Page_562"></span>that they are innocent,
and that their religion is rather beneficial, I banish thee to an
island, that I may not seem myself to do away with my own decrees.  He
asked then that the condemned criminal should be let go; and when he was
let go, John said:  Depart, give thanks to God, who has this day
delivered thee from prison and from death.

<span id="vii.xxxvii-p22"></span>And while they were standing, a certain
home-born slave of Domitian’s, of those in the bed-chamber, was suddenly
seized by the unclean demon, and lay dead; and word was brought to the
king.  And the king was moved, and entreated John to help her.  And John
said:  It is not in man to do this; but since thou knowest how to reign,
but dost not know from whom thou hast received it, learn who has the
power over both thee and thy kingdom.  And he prayed thus:  O Lord, the
God of every kingdom, and master of every creature, give to this maiden
the breath of life.  And having prayed, he raised her up.  And Domitian,
astonished at all the wonders, sent him away to an island, appointing
for him a set time.

<span id="vii.xxxvii-p23"></span>And straightway John sailed to Patmos,
where also he was deemed worthy to see the revelation of the end.  And
when Domitian was dead, Nerva succeeded to the kingdom, and recalled all
who had been banished; and having kept the kingdom for a year, he made
Trajan his successor in the kingdom.  And when he was king over the
Romans, John went to Ephesus, and regulated all the teaching of the
church, holding many conferences, and reminding them of what the Lord
had said to them, and what duty he had assigned to each.  And when he
was old and changed, he ordered Polycarp to be bishop over the church.

<span id="vii.xxxvii-p24"></span>And what like his end was, or his
departure from men, who cannot give an account of?  For on the following
day, which was the Lord’s day, and in the presence of the brethren, he
began to say to them:  Brethren, and fellow-servants, and co-heirs, and
copartners of the kingdom of the Lord, know the Lord what miracles He
hath shown you through me, what wonders, what cures, what signs, what
gracious gifts, teachings, rulings, rests, services, glories, graces,
gifts, faiths, communions; how many things you have seen with your eyes,
that ear hath not heard.  Be strong, therefore, in Him, remembering Him
in all your doings, knowing the mystery of the dispensation that has
come to men, for the sake of which the Lord has worked.  He then,
through me, exhorts you:  Brethren, I wish to remain without grief,
without insult, without treachery, without punishment.  For He also
knows insult from you, He knows also dishonour, He knows also treachery,
He knows also punishment from those that disobey His commandments.  Let
not therefore our God be grieved, the good, the compassionate, the
merciful, the holy, the pure, the undefiled, the only, the one, the
immutable, the sincere, the guileless, the slow to anger, He that is
higher and more exalted than every name that we speak or think of—our
God, Jesus Christ.  Let Him rejoice along with us because we conduct
ourselves well; let Him be glad because we live in purity; let Him rest
because we behave reverently; let Him be pleased because we live in
fellowship; let Him smile because we are sober-minded; let Him be
delighted because we love.  These things, brethren, I communicate to
you, pressing on to the work set before me, already perfected for me by
the Lord.  For what else have I to say to you?  Keep the sureties of
your God; keep His presence, that shall not be taken away from you.  And
if then ye sin no more, He will forgive you what ye have done in
ignorance; but if, after ye have known Him, and He has had compassion
upon you, you return to the like courses, even your former offences will
be laid to your charge, and ye shall have no portion or compassion
before His face. <span id="fr_2441"></span>[2442](#fn_2441.md)

<span id="vii.xxxvii-p26"></span>And when he had said this to them, he
thus prayed:  Jesus, who didst wreathe this crown by Thy twining, who
hast inserted these many flowers into the everlasting flower of Thy
countenance, who hast sown these words among them, be Thou Thyself the
protector and healer of Thy people.  Thou alone art benignant and not
haughty, alone merciful and kind, alone a Saviour, and just; Thou who
always seest what belongs to all, and art in all, and everywhere
present, God Lord Jesus Christ; who with Thy gifts and Thy compassion
coverest those that hope in Thee; who knowest intimately those that
everywhere speak against us, and blaspheme Thy holy name, do Thou alone,
O Lord, help Thy servants with Thy watchful care.  So be it, Lord.

<span id="vii.xxxvii-p27"></span>And having asked bread, he gave thanks
thus, saying:  What praise, or what sort of offering, or what
thanksgiving, shall we, breaking the bread, invoke, but Thee only?  We
glorify the name by which Thou hast been called by the Father; we
glorify the name by which Thou hast been called through the Son; we
glorify the resurrection which has been manifested to us through Thee;
of Thee we glorify the seed, <span id="fr_2442"></span>[2443](#fn_2442.md)
the word, the grace, the true pearl, the treasure, the plough, the
net, <span id="fr_2443"></span>[2444](#fn_2443.md) the majesty, the diadem,
Him called Son of man for our sakes, the truth, the rest, the knowledge,
the freedom, the place of refuge in Thee.  For Thou alone art Lord, the
root of immortality, and the fountain of incorruption, <span
id="page_563">p. 563</span> <span id="vii.xxxvii-Page_563"></span>and
the seat of the ages; Thou who hast been called all these for our sakes,
that now we, calling upon Thee through these, may recognise Thine
illimitable majesty, presented to us by Thy presence, that can be seen
only by the pure, seen in Thine only Son.

<span id="vii.xxxvii-p30"></span>And having broken the bread, he gave it
to us, praying for each of the brethren, that he might be worthy of the
Eucharist of the Lord.  He also therefore, having likewise tasted it,
said:  To me also let there be a portion with you, and peace, O
beloved.  And having thus spoken, and confirmed the brethren, he said to
Eutyches, also named Verus:  Behold, I appoint thee a minister <span
id="fr_2444"></span>[2445](#fn_2444.md) of the Church of Christ, and I
entrust to thee the flock of Christ.  Be mindful, therefore, of the
commandments of the Lord; and if thou shouldst fall into trials or
dangers, be not afraid:  for thou shalt fall under many troubles, and
thou shalt be shown to be an eminent witness <span
id="fr_2445"></span>[2446](#fn_2445.md) of the Lord.  Thus, then, Verus,
attend to the flock as a servant of God, until the time appointed for
thy testimony.

<span id="vii.xxxvii-p33"></span>And when John had spoken this, and more
than this, having entrusted to him the flock of Christ, he says to him: 
Take some brethren, with baskets and vessels, and follow me.  And
Eutyches, without considering, <span
id="fr_2446"></span>[2447](#fn_2446.md) did what he was bid.  And the
blessed John having gone forth from the house, went outside of the
gates, having told the multitude to stand off from him.  And having come
to the tomb of one of our brethren, he told them to dig.  And they dug. 
And he says:  Let the trench be deeper.  And as they dug, he conversed
with those who had come out of the house with him, building them up, and
furnishing them thoroughly into the majesty of the Lord.  And when the
young men had finished the trench, as he had wished, while we knew <span
id="fr_2447"></span>[2448](#fn_2447.md) nothing, he takes off the clothes
he had on, and throws them, as if they were some bedding, into the depth
of the trench; and, standing in only his drawers, <span
id="fr_2448"></span>[2449](#fn_2448.md) stretched forth his hands, and
prayed.

<span id="vii.xxxvii-p37"></span>O God, who hast chosen us for the
mission <span id="fr_2449"></span>[2450](#fn_2449.md) of the Gentiles, who
hast sent us out into the world, who hast declared Thyself through the
apostles; who hast never rested, but always savest from the foundation
of the world; who hast made Thyself known through all nature; who hast
made our wild and savage nature quiet and peaceable; who hast given
Thyself to it when thirsting after knowledge; <span
id="fr_2450"></span>[2451](#fn_2450.md) who hast put to death its
adversary, when it took refuge in Thee; who hast given it Thy hand, and
raised it from the things done in Hades; who hast shown it its own
enemy; who hast in purity turned its thoughts upon Thee, O Christ Jesus,
Lord of things in heaven, and law of things on earth, the course of
things aerial, and guardian of things etherial, the fear of those under
the earth, and grace of Thine own people, receive also the soul of Thy
John, which has been certainly deemed worthy by Thee, Thou who hast
preserved me also till the present hour pure to Thyself, and free from
intercourse with woman; who, when I wished in my youth to marry, didst
appear to me, and say, I am in need of thee, John; who didst strengthen
for me beforehand my bodily weakness; who, when a third time I wished to
marry, didst say to me at the third hour, in the sea, John, if thou wert
not mine, I would let thee marry; who hast opened up the sight of my
mind, and hast favoured my bodily <span
id="fr_2451"></span>[2452](#fn_2451.md) eyes; who, when I was looking about
me, didst call even the gazing upon a woman hateful; who didst deliver
me from temporary show, and preserve me for that which endureth for
ever; who didst separate me from the filthy madness of the flesh; who
didst stop up <span id="fr_2452"></span>[2453](#fn_2452.md) the secret
disease of the soul, and cut out its open actions; who didst afflict and
banish him who rebelled in me; who didst establish my love to Thee
spotless and unimpaired; who didst give me undoubting faith in Thee; who
hast drawn out for me pure thoughts towards Thee; who hast given me the
due reward of my works; who hast set it in my soul to have no other
possession than Thee alone:  for what is more precious than Thou?  Now,
O Lord, when I have accomplished Thy stewardship with which I was
entrusted, make me worthy of Thy repose, having wrought that which is
perfect in Thee, which is ineffable salvation.  And as I go to Thee, let
the fire withdraw, let darkness be overcome, let the furnace be
slackened, let Gehenna be extinguished, let the angels follow, let the
demons be afraid, let the princes be broken in pieces, let the powers of
darkness fall, let the places on the right hand stand firm, let those on
the left abide not, let the devil be muzzled, let Satan be laughed to
scorn, let his madness be tamed, let his wrath be broken, let his
children be trodden under foot, and let all his root be uprooted; and
grant to me to accomplish the journey to Thee, not insulted, not
despitefully treated, and to receive what Thou hast promised to those
that live in purity, and that have loved a holy life.

<span id="vii.xxxvii-p42"></span>And gazing towards heaven, he glorified
God; and having sealed himself altogether, he stood and said to us,
Peace and grace be with you, <span id="page_564">p. 564</span> <span
id="vii.xxxvii-Page_564"></span>brethren! and sent the brethren away. 
And when they went on the morrow they did not find him, but his sandals,
and a fountain welling up.  And after that they remembered what had been
said to Peter by the Lord about him:  For what does it concern thee if I
should wish him to remain until I come? <span
id="fr_2453"></span>[2454](#fn_2453.md)   And they glorified God for the
miracle that had happened.  And having thus believed, they retired
praising and blessing the benignant God; because to Him is due glory now
and ever, and to ages of ages.  Amen.
