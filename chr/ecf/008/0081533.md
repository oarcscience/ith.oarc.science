<span id="x.xix-p2"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="x.xix-p2.1"></span>It</span> may be worth while to state here, that
I have uniformly (mistakes excepted) put my chronological statements, at
the head of introductions, into brackets, so as to make the reader sure
that the Edinburgh edition is not to be responsible for them.  Some have
inferred, therefore, that what follows is from the Edinburgh; but I
think my modes of expression sufficient, generally, to guard against
misconception.  Notes (like this) are sometimes marked, “By the American
Editor,” when I have feared a misleading ambiguity.  Otherwise, I have
been unguarded.  All the introductions in these “Remains” are mine, save
the prefatory paragraphs of the translator on pp. 747, 748.  Annotations
on my own material are not bracketed.  The very large amount of work
bestowed upon this edition can only be known by comparison with the
Edinburgh.  In several instances of delicate criticism I have obtained
valuable aid from my beloved friend, F. P. <span class="c9"><span

in questions of the low Latin or ambiguous Greek.
