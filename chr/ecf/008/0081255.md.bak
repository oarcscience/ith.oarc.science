<span id="vii.xii.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vii.xii.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 2.</span>

<span id="vii.xii.iii-p2"></span>And Pilate seeing this, was afraid, and
sought to go away from the tribunal; but when he was still thinking of
going away, his wife sent to him, saying:  Have nothing to do with this
just man, for many things have I suffered on his account this
night. <span id="fr_1811"></span>[1812](#fn_1811.md)   And Pilate,
summoning the Jews, says to them:  You know that my wife is a worshipper
of God, and prefers to adhere to the Jewish religion along with you. 
They say to him:  Yes; we know.  Pilate says to them:  Behold, my
wife <span id="fr_1812"></span>[1813](#fn_1812.md) has sent to me, saying,
Have nothing to do with this just man, for many things have I suffered
on account of him this night.  And the Jews answering, say unto Pilate: 
Did we not tell thee that he was a sorcerer? <span
id="fr_1813"></span>[1814](#fn_1813.md) behold, he has sent a dream to thy
wife.

<span id="vii.xii.iii-p6"></span><span id="page_418">p. 418</span> <span
id="vii.xii.iii-Page_418"></span>And Pilate, having summoned Jesus, says
to Him:  What do these witness against thee?  Sayest thou nothing?  And
Jesus said:  Unless they had the power, they would say nothing; for
every one has the power of his own mouth to speak both good and evil. 
They shall see to it. <span id="fr_1814"></span>[1815](#fn_1814.md)

<span id="vii.xii.iii-p8"></span>And the elders of the Jews answered,
and said to Jesus:  What shall we see? first, that thou wast born of
fornication; secondly, that thy birth in Bethlehem was the cause of the
murder of the infants; thirdly, that thy father Joseph and thy mother
Mary fled into Egypt because they had no confidence in the people.

<span id="vii.xii.iii-p9"></span>Some of the bystanders, pious men of
the Jews, say:  we deny that he was born of fornication; for we know
that Joseph espoused Mary, and he was not born of fornication.  Pilate
says to the Jews who said that he was of fornication:  This story of
yours is not true, because they were betrothed, as also these
fellow-countrymen of yours say.  Annas and Caiaphas say to Pilate:  All
the multitude of us cry out that he was born of fornication, and are not
believed; these are proselytes, and his disciples.  And Pilate, calling
Annas and Caiaphas, says to them:  What are proselytes?  They say to
him:  They are by birth children of the Greeks, and have now become
Jews.  And those that said that He was not born of fornication,
viz.—Lazarus, Asterius, Antonius, James, Amnes, Zeras, Samuel, Isaac,
Phinees, Crispus, Agrippas, and Judas <span
id="fr_1815"></span>[1816](#fn_1815.md) —say:  We are not proselytes, but
are children of the Jews, and speak of the truth; for we were present at
the betrothal of Joseph and Mary.

<span id="vii.xii.iii-p11"></span>And Pilate, calling these twelve men
who said that He was not born of fornication, says to them:  I adjure
you by the health of Cæsar, to tell me whether it be true that you say,
that he was not born of fornication.  They say to Pilate:  We have a law
against taking oaths, because it is a sin; but they will swear by the
health of Cæsar, <span id="fr_1816"></span>[1817](#fn_1816.md) that it is
not as we have said, and we are liable to death.  Pilate says to Annas
and Caiaphas:  Have you nothing to answer to this?  Annas and Caiaphas
say to Pilate:  These twelve are believed when they say that he was not
born of fornication; all the multitude of us cry out that he was born of
fornication, and that he is a sorcerer, and he says that he is the Son
of God and a king, and we are not believed.

<span id="vii.xii.iii-p13"></span>And Pilate orders all the multitude to
go out, except the twelve men who said that He was not born of
fornication, and he ordered Jesus to be separated from them.  And Pilate
says to them:  For what reason do they wish to put him to death?  They
say to him:  They are angry because he cures on the Sabbath.  Pilate
says:  For a good work do they wish to put him to death?  They say to
him:  Yes.
