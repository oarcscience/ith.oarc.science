id="vi.iv.xvii.i-p2.1"></span>Chapter I.—Mattidia is Baptized in the
Sea.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xvii.i-p3"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iv.xvii.i-p3.1"></span>Much</span> earlier than usual Peter
awoke, and came to us, and awaking us, said:  “Let Faustinus and
Faustinianus, along with Clement and the household, accompany me, that
we may go to some sheltered spot by the sea, and there be able to
baptize her without attracting observation.”  Accordingly, when we had
come to the sea-shore, he baptized her between some rocks, which
supplied a place at once free from wind and dust. <span
id="fr_1188"></span>[1189](#fn_1188)   But we brothers, along with our
brother and some others, retired because of the women and bathed, and
coming again to the women, we took them along with us, and thus we went
to a secret place and prayed.  Then Peter, on account of the multitude,
sent the women on before, ordering them to go to their lodging by
another way, and he permitted us alone of the men to accompany our
mother and the rest of the women. <span
id="fr_1189"></span>[1190](#fn_1189)   We went then to our lodging, and
while waiting for Peter’s arrival, we conversed with each other.  Peter
came several hours after, and breaking the bread for the
Eucharist, <span id="fr_1190"></span>[1191](#fn_1190) and putting salt
upon it, he gave it first to our mother, and, after her, to us her
sons.  And thus we took food along with her and blessed God.

<span id="vi.iv.xvii.i-p4"></span> Lit., “tranquil and clean.”  \[The
baptism is narrated in *Recognitions*, vii. 38.—R.\]

<span id="vi.iv.xvii.i-p5"></span> We have adopted an emendation of
Schwegler’s.  The <span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iv.xvii.i-p5.1"></span>mss.</span> read either “these” or “the
same” for “the rest of.”

<span id="fn_1190"></span>[305:1191](0081028.htm#fr_1190) <span
id="vi.iv.xvii.i-p5.2"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.xvii.i-p6"></span> The words “for the Eucharist” might
be translated “after thanksgiving.”  But it is much the same which, for
the Eucharist is plainly meant.  The *Epitomes* have it:  “taking the
bread, giving thanks, blessing, and consecrating it, he gave it; ” but
no mention is made of salt.  \[The details here are more specific than
in *Recognitions*, vii. 38.  \[The mention of “salt” is peculiar. 
Compare “the salt” named as one of the “seven witnesses” in the
baptismal form of the Elkesaites, Hippolytus, *Ante-Nicene Fathers*, v.
pp. 132, 133.—R.\]
