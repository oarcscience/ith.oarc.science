<span id="vi.iv.xx.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.xx.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.—It is Asserted that Christ’s
Teaching is Different from Peter’s.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xx.iv-p2"></span>“‘And that he does not really believe
even the doctrines proclaimed by his teacher is evident, for he
proclaims doctrines opposite to his. <span
id="fr_1317"></span>[1318](#fn_1317)   For he said to some one, as I
learn, <span id="fr_1318"></span>[1319](#fn_1318) “Call me not good, for
the good is one.”  Now in speaking of the good one, he no longer speaks
of that just one, <span id="fr_1319"></span>[1320](#fn_1319) whom the
Scriptures proclaim, who kills and makes alive,—kills those who sin, and
makes alive those who live according to His will.  But that he did not
really call Him who is the framer of the world good, is plain to any one
who can reflect.  For the framer of the world was known to Adam whom He
had made, and to Enoch who pleased Him, and to Noah who was seen to be
just by Him; likewise to Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob; also to Moses,
and the people, and the whole world.  But Jesus, the <span
id="page_319">p. 319</span> <span
id="vi.iv.xx.iv-Page_319"></span>teacher of Peter himself, came and
said, <span id="fr_1320"></span>[1321](#fn_1320) “No one knew the Father
except the Son, as no one knoweth <span
id="fr_1321"></span>[1322](#fn_1321) even the Son except the Father, and
those to whom the Son may wish to reveal Him.”  If, then, it was the Son
himself who was present, it was from the time of his appearance that he
began to reveal to those to whom he wished, Him who was unknown to all. 
And thus the Father was unknown to all who lived before him, and could
not thus be He who was known to all.
