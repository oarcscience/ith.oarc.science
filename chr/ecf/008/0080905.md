id="vi.iv.xii.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXII.—“Rather Rejoice.”</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xii.xxii-p2"></span>“But still, though all demons, with
all diseases, flee before you, you are not to rejoice in this only, but
in that, through grace, your names, as of the ever-living, are written
in heaven.  Thus also the Divine Holy Spirit rejoices because man hath
overcome death; for the putting of the demons to flight makes for the
safety of another.  But this we say, not as denying that we ought to
help others, but that we ought not to be inflated by this and neglect
ourselves.  It happens, also, that the demons flee before some wicked
men by reason of the honoured name, and both he who expels the demon and
he who witnesses it are deceived:  he who expels him, as if he were
honoured on account of righteousness, not knowing the wickedness of the
demon.  For he has at once honoured the name, and by his flight has
brought the wicked man into a thought of his righteousness, and so
deceived him away from repentance.  But the looker-on, associating with
the expeller as a pious man, hastens to a like manner of life, and is
ruined.  Sometimes also they pretend to flee before adjurations not made
in the name of God, that they may deceive men, and destroy them whom
they will.
