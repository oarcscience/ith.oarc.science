id="vi.iv.xvi.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter III.—Recognition of Nicetas and
Aquila.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xvi.iii-p2"></span>Now when this summary narrative had
been given by Peter, Nicetas and Aquila in amazement said:  “Is this
indeed true, O Ruler and Lord of the universe, or is it a dream?”  And
Peter said:  “Unless we are asleep, it certainly is true.”  On this they
waited for a little in deep meditation, and then said:  “We are
Faustinus and Faustinianus.  From the commencement of your conversation
we looked at each other, and conjectured much with regard to ourselves,
whether what was said had reference to us or not; for we reflected that
many coincidences take place in life.  Wherefore we remained silent
while our hearts beat fast.  But when you came to the end of your
narrative, we saw clearly <span id="fr_1160"></span>[1161](#fn_1160.md)
that your statements referred to us, and then we avowed who we were.” 
And on saying this, bathed in tears, they rushed in to see their mother;
and although they found her asleep, they were yet anxious to embrace
her.  But Peter forbade them, saying:  “Let me bring you and present you
to your mother, lest she should, in consequence of her great and sudden
joy, lose her reason, as she is slumbering, and her spirit is held fast
by sleep.”
