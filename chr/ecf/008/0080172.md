id="vi.iii.iv.xxxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXV.—How Error Cannot Stand
with Truth.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iv.xxxv-p2"></span>Then Simon said:  “Instruct us,
therefore, how it can be consistent that he who causes divisions, which
divisions cause those who are divided to fall, can either seem to be
good, or to have come for the salvation of men.”  Then Peter said:  “I
will tell you how our Master said that every kingdom and every house
divided against itself cannot stand; and whereas He Himself did this,
see how it makes for salvation.  By the word of truth He certainly
divides the kingdom of the world, which is founded in error, and every
home in it, that error may fall, and truth may reign.  But if it happen
to any house, that error, being introduced by any one, divides the
truth, then, where error has gained a footing, it is certain that truth
cannot stand.”  Then Simon said:  “But it is uncertain whether your
master divides error or truth.”  Then Peter:  “That belongs to another
question; but if you are agreed that everything which is divided falls,
it remains that I show, if only you will hear in peace, that our Jesus
has divided and dispelled error by teaching truth.”
