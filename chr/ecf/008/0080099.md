id="vi.iii.iii.xxxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXVII.—The Holy
Place.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iii.xxxvii-p2"></span>“In addition to these things, he
also appointed a place in which alone it should be lawful to them to
sacrifice to God. <span id="fr_559"></span>[560](#fn_559)   And all this
was arranged with this view, that when the fitting time should come, and
they should learn by means of the Prophet that God desires mercy and not
sacrifice, <span id="fr_560"></span>[561](#fn_560) they might see Him
who should teach them that the place chosen of God, in which it was
suitable that victims should be offered to God, is his Wisdom; and that
on the other hand they might hear that this place, which seemed chosen
for a time, often harassed as it had been by hostile invasions and
plunderings, was at last to be wholly destroyed. <span
id="fr_561"></span>[562](#fn_561)   And in order to impress this upon
them, even before the coming of the true Prophet, who was to reject at
once the sacrifices and the place, it was often plundered by enemies and
burnt with fire, and the people carried into captivity among foreign
nations, and then brought back when they betook themselves to the mercy
of God; that by these things they might be taught that a people who
offer sacrifices are driven away and delivered up into the hands of the
enemy, but they who do mercy and righteousness are without sacrifices
freed from captivity, and restored to their native land.  But it fell
out that very few understood this; for the greater number, though they
could perceive and observe these things, yet were held by the irrational
opinion of the vulgar:  for right opinion with liberty is the
prerogative of a few.”
