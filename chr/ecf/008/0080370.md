<span id="vi.iii.ix.iii-p2"></span>When Peter thus spoke, they of course
acquiesced, saying:  “It does not greatly sadden us to do this, because
we are ordered by you, who have been chosen by the foresight of Christ
to do and to counsel well in all things; but also because, while it is a
heavy loss not to see our lord Peter for one, or it may be two days, yet
it is not intolerable.  And we think of our twelve brethren who go
before us, and who are deprived of the advantage of hearing and seeing
you for a whole month out of the three that you stay in every city. 
Therefore we shall not delay doing as you order, because you order all
things aright.”  And thus saying, they went forward, having received
instructions that they should speak to the brethren who journeyed with
them outside the city, and request them not to enter the cities in a
crowd and with tumult, but apart, and divided.
