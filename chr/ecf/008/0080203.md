<span id="vi.iii.iv.lxvi-p2"></span>To this Simon replied: <span
id="fr_668"></span>[669](#fn_668.md)   “O thou who hast woven a web of many
frivolities, listen now.  It is impossible that anything which comes
into a man’s thoughts should not also subsist in truth and reality.  For
things that do not subsist, have no appearances; <span
id="fr_669"></span>[670](#fn_669.md) but things that have no appearances,
cannot present themselves to our thoughts.”  Then said Peter:  “If
everything that can come into our thoughts has a subsistence, then, with
respect to that place of immensity which you say is outside the world,
if one thinks in his heart that it is light, and another that it is
darkness, how can one and the same place be both light and darkness,
according to their different thoughts concerning it?”  Then said Simon: 
“Let pass for the present what I have said; and tell us what you suppose
to be above the heavens.”
