<span id="vii.v.xxxix-p2"></span>And it came to pass a second time, that
Joseph and Mary were asked by the people that Jesus should be taught His
letters in school.  They did not refuse to do so; and according to the
commandment of the elders, they took Him to a master to be instructed in
human learning.  Then the master began to teach Him in an imperious
tone, saying:  Say Alpha. <span id="fr_1684"></span>[1685](#fn_1684.md)  
And Jesus said to him:  Do thou tell me first what Betha is, and I will
tell thee what Alpha is.  And upon this the master got angry and struck
Jesus; and no sooner had he struck Him, than he fell down dead.

<span id="vii.v.xxxix-p4"></span>And Jesus went home again to His
mother.  And Joseph, being afraid, called Mary to him, and said to her: 
Know of a surety that my soul is sorrowful even unto death on account of
this child.  For it is very likely that at some time or other some one
will strike him in malice, and he will die.  But Mary answered and
said:  O man of God! do not believe that this is possible.  You may
believe to a certainty that He who has sent him to be born among men
will Himself guard him from all mischief, and will in His own name
preserve him from evil.
