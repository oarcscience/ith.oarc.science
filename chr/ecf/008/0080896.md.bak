id="vi.iv.xii.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIII.—Deceits of the
Demons.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xii.xiii-p2"></span>“But some of the maleficent demons
deceive in another way.  For at first they do not even show their
existence, in order that care may not be taken against them; but in due
time, by means of anger, love, or some other affection, they suddenly
injure the body, by sword, or halter, or precipice, or something else,
and at last bring to punishment the deceived souls of those who have
been mixed up with them, as we said, withdrawing into the purifying
fire.  But others, who are deceived in another way, do not approach us,
being seduced by the instigations of maleficent demons, as if they
suffered these things at the hands of the gods themselves, on account of
their neglect of them, and were able to reconcile them by sacrifices,
and that it is not needful to come to us, but rather to flee from and
hate us.  And at the same time <span
id="fr_1114"></span>[1115](#fn_1114.md) they hate and flee from those who
have greater compassion for them, and who follow after them in order to
do good to them.
