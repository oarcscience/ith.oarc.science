id="vi.iv.xii.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIII.—The Sick Healed.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xii.xxiii-p2"></span>“This then we would have you know,
that unless any one of his own accord give himself over as a slave to
demons, as I said before, the demon has no power against him.  Choosing,
therefore, to worship one God, and refraining from the table of demons,
and undertaking chastity with philanthropy and righteousness, and being
baptized with the thrice-blessed invocation for the remission of sins,
and devoting yourselves as much as you can to the perfection of purity,
you can escape everlasting punishment, and be constituted heirs of
eternal blessings.”

<span id="vi.iv.xii.xxiii-p3"></span>Having thus spoken, he ordered
those to approach who were distressed with diseases; <span
id="fr_1118"></span>[1119](#fn_1118.md) and thus many approached, having
come together through the experience of those who had been healed
yesterday.  And he having laid his hands upon them and prayed, and
immediately healed them, and having charged them and the others to come
earlier, he bathed and partook of food, and went to sleep.
