<span id="vi.iv.v.xxxvi-p2"></span>But he (Peter) saw me disheartened,
and asked the reason; and being told that it proceeded from no cause but
the postponement of <span id="page_236">p. 236</span> <span
id="vi.iv.v.xxxvi-Page_236"></span>the inquiry, <span
id="fr_943"></span>[944](#fn_943.md) he said:  “He who has apprehended that
the world is regulated by the good providence of God, O beloved Clement,
is not vexed by things howsoever occurring, considering that things take
their course advantageously under the providence of the Ruler.  Whence,
knowing that He is just, and living with a good conscience, he knows how
by right reason to shake off from his soul any annoyance that befalls
him, because, when complete, it must come to some unknown good.  Now
then, let not Simon the magician’s postponement of the inquiry grieve
you; for perhaps it has happened from the providence of God for your
profit.  Wherefore I shall not scruple to speak to you as being my
special friend.
