<span id="vii.xiii.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vii.xiii.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 15.</span>

<span id="vii.xiii.xvi-p2"></span>Nicodemus says:  O children of the
inhabitants of Jerusalem, the prophet Helias went up into the height of
heaven with a fiery chariot, and it is nothing incredible if Jesus too
has risen; for the prophet Helias was a prototype of Jesus, in order
that you, hearing that Jesus has risen, might not disbelieve.  I
therefore say and advise, that it is befitting that we send soldiers
into Galilee, to that place where these men testify that they saw him
with his disciples, in order that they may go round about and find him,
and that thus we may ask pardon of him for the evil which we have done
to him.  This proposal pleased them; and they chose soldiers, and sent
them away into Galilee.  And Jesus indeed they did not find; but they
found Joseph in Arimathæa.

<span id="vii.xiii.xvi-p3"></span>When, therefore, the soldiers had
returned, the chief priests, having ascertained that Joseph was found,
brought the people together, and said:  What shall we do to get Joseph
to come to us?  After deliberating, therefore, they wrote to him a
letter to the following effect:—O father Joseph, peace *be* to thee and
all thy house, and thy friends!  We know that we have offended against
God, and against thee His servant.  On account of this, we entreat thee
to come here to us thy children.  For we have wondered much how thou
didst escape from the prison, and we say in truth that we had an evil
design against thee.  But God, seeing that our designs against thee were
unjust, has delivered thee out of our hands.  But come to us, for thou
art the honour of our people.

<span id="vii.xiii.xvi-p4"></span>This letter the Jews sent to
Arimathæa, with seven soldiers, friends of Joseph.  And they went away
and found him; and having respectfully saluted him, as they had been
ordered, they gave him the letter.  And after receiving it and reading
it, he glorified God, and embraced the soldiers; and having set a table,
ate and drank with them during all the day and the night.

<span id="vii.xiii.xvi-p5"></span>And on the following day he set out
with them to Jerusalem; and the people came forth to meet him, and
embraced him.  And Nicodemus received him into his own house.  And the
day after, Annas and Caiaphas, the chief priests, having summoned him to
the temple, said to him:  Give glory to the God of Israel, and tell us
the truth.  For we know that thou didst bury Jesus; and on this account
we laid hold of thee, and locked thee up in the prison.  Thereafter,
when we sought to bring thee out to be put to death, we did not find
thee, and we were greatly astonished and afraid.  Moreover, we prayed to
God that we might find thee, and ask thee.  Tell us therefore the truth.

<span id="vii.xiii.xvi-p6"></span>Joseph said to them:  In the evening
of the Preparation, when you secured me in prison, I fell a-praying
throughout the whole night, and throughout the whole day of the
Sabbath.  And at midnight I see the prison-house that four angels lifted
it up, <span id="fr_1924"></span>[1925](#fn_1924.md) holding it by the four
corners.  And Jesus came in like lightning, and I fell to the ground
from fear.  Taking hold of me, therefore, by the hand, he raised me,
saying, Fear not, Joseph.  Thereafter, embracing me, he kissed me, and
said, Turn thyself, and see who I am.  Turning myself, therefore, and
looking, I said, My lord, I know not who thou art.  He says, I am Jesus,
whom thou didst bury the day before yesterday.  I say to him, Show me
the tomb, and then I shall believe.  He took me, therefore, by the hand,
and led me away to the tomb, which had been opened.  And seeing the
linen and the napkin, and recognising him, I said, Blessed is he that
cometh in the name of the Lord; <span
id="fr_1925"></span>[1926](#fn_1925.md) and I adored him.  Then taking me
by the hand, and accompanied by the angels, he brought me to my house in
Arimathæa, and said to me, Sit here for forty days; for I go to my
disciples, in order that I may enable them fully to proclaim my
resurrection.
