id="vi.iii.vii.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI.—Free-Will.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.vii.vi-p2"></span>“Whether any one, truly hearing the
word of of the true Prophet; is willing or unwilling to receive it, and
to embrace His burden, that is, the precepts of life, he has either in
his power, for we are free in will. <span
id="fr_753"></span>[754](#fn_753)   For if it were so, that those who
hear had it not in their power to do otherwise than they had heard,
there were some power of nature in virtue of which it were not free to
him to pass over to another opinion.  Or if, again, no one of the
hearers could at all receive it, this also were a power of nature which
should compel the doing of some one thing, and should leave no place for
the other course.  But now, since it is free for the mind to turn its
judgment to which side it pleases, and to choose the way which it
approves, it is clearly manifest that there is in men a liberty of
choice.
