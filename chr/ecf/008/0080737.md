<span id="vi.iv.vi.l-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.vi.l-p1.1"></span>Chapter L.—His Teaching Concerning the
Scriptures.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.vi.l-p2"></span>Then Peter:  “As to the mixture of truth
with falsehood, <span id="fr_992"></span>[993](#fn_992.md) I remember that
on one occasion He, finding fault with the Sadducees, said, ‘Wherefore
ye do err, not knowing the true things of the Scriptures; and on this
account ye are ignorant of the power of God.’ <span
id="fr_993"></span>[994](#fn_993.md)   But if He cast up to them that they
knew not the true things of the Scriptures, it is manifest that there
are false things in them.  And also, inasmuch as He said, ‘Be ye prudent
money-changers,’ <span id="fr_994"></span>[995](#fn_994.md) it is because
there are genuine and spurious words.  And whereas He said, ‘Wherefore
do ye not <span id="page_248">p. 248</span> <span
id="vi.iv.vi.l-Page_248"></span>perceive that which is reasonable in the
Scriptures?’  He makes the understanding of him stronger who voluntarily
judges soundly.

<span id="vi.iv.vi.l-p3"></span> \[Comp. Homily II. 40.  The attitude of
Peter, as here represented, disparaging the Old Testament, appearing to
exalt the author of Christ’s teachings, and yet ignoring the claims of
His Person and Work, seeks its justification in rationalistic
interpretation.  The attitude is not an uncommon one at present.—R.\]

of Christ.  It is probably from one of the apocryphal Gospels.  \[Comp.
Homily II. 51.—R.\]
