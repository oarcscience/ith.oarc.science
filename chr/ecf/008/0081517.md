<span id="x.vi.ii.i-p3"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="x.vi.ii.i-p3.1"></span>Concerning the Martyrdom of James, the
Brother of the Lord, from Book V. <span
id="fr_3692"></span>[3693](#fn_3692) </span>

<span id="x.vi.ii.i-p5"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="x.vi.ii.i-p5.1"></span>James</span>, the Lord’s brother, succeeds to
the government of the Church, in conjunction with the apostles.  He has
been universally called *the Just*, from the days of the Lord down to
the present time.  For many bore the name of James; but this one was
holy from his mother’s womb.  He drank no wine or *other* intoxicating
liquor, <span id="fr_3693"></span>[3694](#fn_3693) nor did he eat flesh;
no razor came upon his head; he did not anoint himself with oil, nor
make use of the bath.  He alone was permitted to enter the holy
place: <span id="fr_3694"></span>[3695](#fn_3694)   for he did not wear
any woollen garment, but fine linen *only*.  He alone, *I say*, was wont
to go into the temple:  and he used to be found kneeling on his knees,
begging forgiveness for the people—so that the skin of his knees became
horny like that of a camel’s, by reason of his constantly bending the
knee in adoration to God, and begging forgiveness for the people. 
Therefore, in consequence of his pre-eminent justice, he was called *the
Just*, and *Oblias*, <span id="fr_3695"></span>[3696](#fn_3695) which
signifies in Greek *Defence of the People*, and *Justice*, in accordance
with what the prophets declare concerning him.

<span id="x.vi.ii.i-p9"></span>Now some persons belonging to the seven
sects existing among the people, which have been before described by me
in the Notes, asked him:  “What is the door of Jesus?”  <span
id="page_763">p. 763</span> <span id="x.vi.ii.i-Page_763"></span>And he
replied that He was the Saviour.  In consequence of this answer, some
believed that Jesus is the Christ.  But the sects before mentioned did
not believe, either in a resurrection or in the coming of One to requite
every man according to his works; but those who did believe, believed
because of James.  So, when many even of the ruling class believed,
there was a commotion among the Jews, and scribes, and Pharisees, who
said:  “A little more, and we shall have all the people looking for
Jesus as the Christ.

<span id="x.vi.ii.i-p10"></span>They came, therefore, in a body to
James, and said:  “We entreat thee, restrain the people:  for they are
gone astray in their opinions about Jesus, as if he were the Christ.  We
entreat thee to persuade all who have come hither for the day of the
passover, concerning Jesus.  For we all listen to thy persuasion; since
we, as well as all the people, bear thee testimony that thou art just,
and showest partiality to none.  Do thou, therefore, persuade the people
not to entertain erroneous opinions concerning Jesus:  for all the
people, and we also, listen to thy persuasion.  Take thy stand, then,
upon the summit <span id="fr_3696"></span>[3697](#fn_3696) of the
temple, that from that elevated spot thou mayest be clearly seen, and
thy words may be plainly audible to all the people.  For, in order to
attend the passover, all the tribes have congregated *hither*, and some
of the Gentiles also.”

<span id="x.vi.ii.i-p12"></span>The aforesaid scribes and Pharisees
accordingly set James on the summit of the temple, and cried aloud to
him, and said:  “O just one, whom we are all bound to obey, forasmuch as
the people is in error, and follows Jesus the crucified, do thou tell us
what is the door of Jesus, the crucified.”  And he answered with a loud
voice:  “Why ask ye me concerning Jesus the Son of man?  He Himself
sitteth in heaven, at the right hand of the Great Power, and shall come
on the clouds of heaven.”

<span id="x.vi.ii.i-p13"></span>And, when many were fully convinced *by
these words*, and offered praise for the testimony of James, and said,
“Hosanna to the son of David,” then again the said Pharisees and scribes
said to one another, “We have not done well in procuring this testimony
to Jesus.  But let us go up and throw him down, that they may be afraid,
and not believe him.”  And they cried aloud, and said:  “Oh! oh! the
just man himself is in error.”  Thus they fulfilled the Scripture
written in Isaiah:  “Let us away with the just man, because he is
troublesome to us:  therefore shall they eat the fruit of their
doings.”  So they went up and threw down the just man, and said to one
another:  “Let us stone James the Just.”  And they began to stone him: 
for he was not killed by the fall; but he turned, and kneeled down, and
said:  “I beseech Thee, Lord God *our* Father, forgive them; for they
know not what they do.”

<span id="x.vi.ii.i-p14"></span>And, while they were thus stoning him to
death, one of the priests, the sons of Rechab, the son of Rechabim, to
whom testimony is borne by Jeremiah the prophet, began to cry aloud,
saying:  “Cease, what do ye?  The just man is praying for us.”  But one
among them, one of the fullers, took the staff with which he was
accustomed to wring out the garments *he dyed*, and hurled it at the
head of the just man.

<span id="x.vi.ii.i-p15"></span>And so he suffered martyrdom; and they
buried him on the spot, and the pillar erected to his memory still
remains, close by the temple.  This man was a true witness to both Jews
and Greeks that Jesus is the Christ.

<span id="x.vi.ii.i-p16"></span>And shortly after Vespasian besieged
Judæa, taking them captive.
