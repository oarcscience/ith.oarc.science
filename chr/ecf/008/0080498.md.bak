<span id="vi.iii.xi.xxix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iii.xi.xxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIX.—The Gospel More Powerful
Than “Genesis.”</span>

<span id="vi.iii.xi.xxix-p2"></span>“But I shall give a still stronger
proof of the matters in hand.  For, behold, scarcely seven years have
yet passed since the advent of the righteous and true Prophet; and in
the course of these, men of all nations coming to Judæa, and moved both
by the signs and miracles which they saw, and by the grandeur of His
doctrine, received His faith; and then going back to their own
countries, they rejected the lawless rites of the Gentiles, and their
incestuous marriages.  In short, among the Parthians—as Thomas, who is
preaching the Gospel amongst them, has written to us—not many now are
addicted to polygamy; nor among the Medes do many throw their dead to
dogs; nor are the Persians pleased with intercourse with their mothers,
or incestuous marriages with their daughters; nor do the Susian women
practise the adulteries that were allowed them; nor has <span
class="c9"><span id="vi.iii.xi.xxix-p2.1"></span>Genesis</span> been
able to force those into crimes whom the teaching of religion
restrained.
