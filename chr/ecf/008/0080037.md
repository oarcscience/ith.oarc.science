<span id="v.iii.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iii.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII.—Rules for Visits, Exorcisms, and
How People are to Assist the Sick, and to Walk in All Things Without
Offence.</span>

<span id="v.iii.xii-p2"></span>Moreover, also, this is comely and
useful, that a man “visit orphans and widows,” <span
id="fr_408"></span>[409](#fn_408.md) and especially those poor persons who
have many children.  These things are, without controversy, required of
the servants of God, and comely and suitable for them.  This also,
again, is suitable and right and comely for those who are brethren in
Christ, that they should visit those who are harassed by evil spirits,
and pray and pronounce adjurations <span
id="fr_409"></span>[410](#fn_409.md) over them, intelligently, *offering*
such prayer as is acceptable before God; not with a multitude of fine
words, <span id="fr_410"></span>[411](#fn_410.md) well prepared and
arranged, so that they may appear to men eloquent and of a good memory. 
*Such men* are “like a sounding pipe, or a tinkling cymbal;” <span
id="fr_411"></span>[412](#fn_411.md) and they bring no help to those over
whom they make their adjurations; but they speak with terrible words,
and affright people, but do not act with true faith, according to the
teaching of our Lord, who hath said:  “This kind goeth not out but by
fasting and prayer,” <span id="fr_412"></span>[413](#fn_412.md) offered
unceasingly and with earnest mind.  And let them holily ask and beg of
God, with cheerfulness and all circumspection and purity, without hatred
and without malice.  In this way let us approach a brother or a sister
who is sick, and visit them in a way that is right, without guile, and
without covetousness, and without noise, and without talkativeness, and
without such behaviour as is alien from the fear of God, and without
haughtiness, but with the meek and lowly spirit of Christ.  Let them,
therefore, with fasting and with prayer make their adjurations, and not
with the elegant and well-arranged and fitly-ordered words of learning,
but as men who have received the gift of healing from God, confidently,
to the glory of <span id="page_60">p. 60</span> <span
id="v.iii.xii-Page_60"></span>God.  By <span
id="fr_413"></span>[414](#fn_413.md) your fastings and prayers and
perpetual watching, together with your other good works, mortify the
works of the flesh by the power of the Holy Spirit.  He who acts thus
“is a temple of the Holy Spirit of God.” <span
id="fr_414"></span>[415](#fn_414.md)   Let this man cast out demons, and
God will help him.  For it is good that a man help those that are sick. 
Our Lord hath said:  “Cast out demons,” at the same time *commanding*
many other acts of healing; and, “Freely ye have received, freely
give.” <span id="fr_415"></span>[416](#fn_415.md)   For such persons as
these a goodly recompense is *laid up* by God, because they serve their
brethren with the gifts which have been given them by the Lord.  This is
also comely and helpful to the servants of God, because they act
according to the injunctions of our Lord, who hath said:  “I was sick,
and ye visited Me, and so on.” <span id="fr_416"></span>[417](#fn_416.md)  
And this is comely and right and just, that we visit our neighbours for
the sake of God with all seemliness of manner and purity of behaviour;
as the Apostle hath said:  “Who is sick, and I am not sick? who is
offended, and I am not offended?” <span
id="fr_417"></span>[418](#fn_417.md)   But all these things are spoken in
reference to the love with which a man should love his neighbour.  And
in these things let us occupy ourselves, <span
id="fr_418"></span>[419](#fn_418.md) without giving offence, and let us not
do anything with partiality or for the shaming of others, but let us
love the poor as the servants of God, and especially let us visit them. 
For this is comely before God and before men, that we should remember
the poor, and be lovers of the brethren and of strangers, for the sake
of God and for the sake of those who believe in God, as we have learnt
from the law and from the prophets, and from our Lord Jesus Christ,
concerning the love of the brotherhood and the love of strangers:  for
ye know the words which have been spoken concerning the love of the
brotherhood and the love of strangers; <span
id="fr_419"></span>[420](#fn_419.md) powerfully are the words spoken to all
those who do them.
