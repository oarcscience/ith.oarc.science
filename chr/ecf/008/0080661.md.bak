Counsel.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.v.xxviii-p2"></span>“These things, and things reckoned
greater than these, he promised us, on condition only that we should
associate with him, and keep silence as to the wickedness of his
undertaking, so that the scheme of his deceit might succeed.  But still
we would not consent, but even counselled him to desist from such
madness, saying to him:  ‘We, O Simon, remembering our friendship
towards you from our childhood, and out of affection for you, give you
good counsel.  Desist from this attempt.  You cannot be a God.  Fear Him
who is really God.  Know that you are a man, and that the time of your
life is short; and though you should get great riches, or even become a
king, few things accrue to the short time of your life for enjoyment,
and things wickedly gotten soon flee away, and procure everlasting
punishment for the adventurer.  Wherefore we counsel you to fear God, by
whom the soul of every one must be judged for the deeds that he hath
done here.’
