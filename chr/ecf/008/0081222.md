<span id="vii.vi.i-p4"></span>The blessed and glorious ever-virgin Mary,
sprung from the royal stock and family of David, born in the city of
Nazareth, was brought up at Jerusalem in the temple of the Lord.  Her
father was named Joachim, and her mother Anna.  Her father’s house was
from Galilee and the city of Nazareth, but her mother’s family from
Bethlehem.  Their life was guileless and right before the Lord, and
irreproachable and pious before men.  For they divided all their
substance into three parts.  One part they spent upon the temple and the
temple servants; another they distributed to strangers and the poor; the
third they reserved, for themselves and the necessities of their
family.  Thus, dear to God, kind to men, for about twenty years they
lived in their own house, a chaste married life, without having any
children.  Nevertheless they vowed that, should the Lord happen to give
them offspring, they would deliver it to the service of the Lord; on
which account also they used to visit the temple of the Lord at each of
the feasts during the year.
