<span id="vi.iii.iii.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iii.iii.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.—His Increasing
Disquiet.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iii.iv-p2"></span>Being therefore straitened in the
discovery of things, I said to myself, Why do we labour in vain, since
the end of things is manifest?  For if after death I shall be no more,
my present torture is useless; but if there is to be for me a life after
death, let us keep for that life the excitements that belong to it, lest
perhaps some sadder things befall me than those which I now suffer,
unless I shall have lived piously and soberly; and, according to the
opinions of some of the philosophers, I be consigned to the stream of
dark-rolling Phlegethon, or to Tartarus, like Sisyphus and Tityus, and
to eternal punishment in the infernal regions, like Ixion and Tantalus. 
And again I would answer to myself:  But these <span id="page_78">p.
78</span> <span id="vi.iii.iii.iv-Page_78"></span>things are fables; or
if it be so, since the matter is in doubt, it is better to live
piously.  But again I would ponder with myself, How should I restrain
myself from the lust of sin, while uncertain as to the reward of
righteousness?—and all the more when I have no certainty what
righteousness is, or what is pleasing to God; and when I cannot
ascertain whether the soul be immortal, and be such that it has anything
to hope for; nor do I know what the future is certainly to be.  Yet
still I cannot rest from thoughts of this sort.
