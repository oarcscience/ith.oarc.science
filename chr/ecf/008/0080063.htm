 was from my earliest age a lover of chastity; while the bent of my mind held me bound as with chains of anxiety and sorrow.&#160; For a thought that was in me&#8212;whence originating, I cannot tell&#8212;constantly led me to think of my condition of mortality, and to discuss such questions as these:&#160; Whether there be for me any life after death, or whether I am to be wholly annihilated:&#160; whether I did not exist before I was born, and whether there shall be no remembrance of this life after death, and so the boundlessness of time shall consign all things to oblivion and silence; so that not only we shall cease to be, but there shall be no remembrance that we have ever been.&#160; This also I revolved in my mind:&#160; when the world was made, or what was before it was made, or whether it has existed from eternity.&#160; For it seemed certain, that if it had been made, it must be doomed to dissolution; and if it be dissolved, what is to be afterwards?&#8212;unless, perhaps, all things shall be buried in oblivion and silence, or something shall be, which the mind of man cannot now conceive.</p>
