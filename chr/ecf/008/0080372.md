id="vi.iii.ix.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V.—Clement’s Affection for
Peter.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.ix.v-p2"></span>Then I answered:  “Think not, my lord,
that I suffer these things unreasonably; but there is a certain cause
and reason of this affection of mine towards you.  For I have you alone
as the object of all my affections, instead of father and mother, and
brethren; but above all this, is the fact that you alone are the cause
of my salvation and knowledge of the truth.  And also this I do not
count of least moment, that my youthful age is subject to the snares of
lusts; and I am afraid to be without you, by whose sole presence all
effeminacy, however irrational it be, is put to shame; although I trust,
by the mercy of God, <span id="page_158">p. 158</span> <span
id="vi.iii.ix.v-Page_158"></span>that even my mind, from what it has
conceived through your instruction, shall be unable to receive aught
else into its thoughts.  Besides, I remember your saying at Cæsarea, ‘If
any one wishes to accompany me, without violating dutifulness, let him
accompany me.’  And by this you meant that he should not make any one
sad, to whom he ought according to God’s appointment to cleave; for
example, that he should not leave a faithful wife, or parents, or the
like.  Now from these I am entirely free, and so I am fit for following
you; and I wish you would grant me that I might perform to you the
service of a servant.”
