id="vi.iii.vii.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter IX.—The Two Kingdoms.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.vii.ix-p2"></span>“For he who persists in evil, and is
the servant of evil, cannot be made a portion of good so long as he
persists in evil, because from the beginning, as we have said, God
instituted two kingdoms, and has given to each man the power of becoming
a portion of that kingdom to which he shall yield himself to obey.  And
since it is decreed by God that no one man can be a servant of both
kingdoms, therefore endeavour with all earnestness to betake yourselves
to the covenant and laws of the good King.  Wherefore also the true
Prophet, when He was present with us, and saw some rich men negligent
with respect to the worship of God, thus unfolded the truth of this
matter:  ‘No one,’ said He, ‘can serve two masters; ye cannot serve God
and mammon;’ <span id="fr_754"></span>[755](#fn_754) calling riches, in
the language of His country, *mammon*.
