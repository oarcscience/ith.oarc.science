to hold a discussion with Simon, he rose earlier than usual and prayed. 
On ceasing to pray, Zacchæus came in, and said:  “Simon is seated
without, discoursing with about thirty of his own special followers.” 
And Peter said:  “Let him talk until the multitude assemble, and then
let us begin the discussion in the following way.  We shall hear all
that has been said by him, and having fitted our reply to this, we shall
go out and discourse.”  And assuredly so it happened.  Zacchæus,
therefore, went out, and not long after entered again, and communicated
to Peter the discourse delivered by Simon against him. <span
