<span id="vi.iii.xii.xxvi-p2"></span>“Hence there has now been added,
that the poets also adorn the falsehoods of error by elegance of words,
and by sweetness of speech persuade that mortals have been made
immortal; yea more, they say that men are changed into stars, and trees,
and animals, and flowers, and birds, and fountains, and rivers.  And but
that it might seem to be a waste of words, I could even enumerate almost
all the stars, and trees, and fountains, and rivers, which they assert
to have been made of men; yet, by way of example, I shall mention at
least one of each class.  They say that Andromeda, the daughter of
Cepheus, was turned into a star; Daphne, the daughter of the river Lado,
into a tree; Hyacinthus, beloved of Apollo, into a flower; Callisto into
the constellation which they call Arctos; Progne and Philomela, with
Tereus, into birds; that Thysbe in Cilicia was dissolved into a
fountain; and Pyramus, at the same place, into a river.  And they assert
that almost all the stars, trees, fountains, and rivers, flowers,
animals, and birds, were at one time human beings.”
