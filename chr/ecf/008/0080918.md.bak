id="vi.iv.xiii.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI.—Why the Serpent Tempts to
Sin.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xiii.xi-p2"></span>“For he knows the original law, that
if he bring you to the persuasion of the so-called gods, so that you sin
against the one good of monarchy, your overthrow becomes a gain to him. 
And that for this reason, because he being <span id="page_282">p.
282</span> <span id="vi.iv.xiii.xi-Page_282"></span>condemned eats
earth, he has power to eat him who through sin being dissolved into
earth, has become earth, your souls going into his belly of fire.  In
order, therefore, that you may suffer these things, he suggests every
thought to your hurt.
