id="vi.iv.iii.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIX.—Installation of
Clement.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.iii.xix-p2"></span>Having thus spoken, he laid his hands
upon me in the presence of all, and compelled me to sit in his own
chair.  And when I was seated, he immediately said to me:  “I entreat
you, in the presence of all the brethren here, that whensoever I depart
from this life, as depart I must, <span id="page_222">p. 222</span>
<span id="vi.iv.iii.xix-Page_222"></span>you send to James the brother
of the Lord a brief account of your reasonings from your boyhood, and
how from the beginning until now you have journeyed with me, hearing the
discourses preached by me in every city, and *seeing* my deeds.  And
then at the end you will not fail to inform him of the manner of my
death, as I said before.  For that event will not grieve him very much,
when he knows that I piously went through what it behoved me to suffer. 
And he will get the greatest comfort when he learns, that not an
unlearned man, or one ignorant of life-giving words, or not knowing the
rule of the Church, shall be entrusted with the chair of the teacher
after me.  For the discourse of a deceiver destroys the souls of the
multitudes who hear.”
