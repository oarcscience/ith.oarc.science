id="viii.iii.ii.i-p1.1"></span>The Second Epistle.</span>

<span id="viii.iii.ii.i-p2"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="viii.iii.ii.i-p2.1"></span>To the Bishops of the Province of
Egypt.</span>

<span id="viii.iii.ii.i-p3"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="viii.iii.ii.i-p3.1"></span>Zephyrinus</span>, archbishop of the city
of Rome, to the most beloved brethren who serve the Lord in Egypt.

<span id="viii.iii.ii.i-p4"></span>So great trust have we received from
the Lord, the Founder of this holy seat and of the apostolic church, and
from the blessed Peter, chief of the apostles, that we may labour with
unwearied affection <span id="fr_2704"></span>[2705](#fn_2704.md) for the
universal Church which has been redeemed by the blood of Christ, and aid
all who serve the Lord, and give help to all who live piously by
apostolic authority.  All who will live <span
id="fr_2705"></span>[2706](#fn_2705.md) piously in Christ must needs endure
reproaches from the impious and aliens, and be despised as fools and
madmen, that they may be made better and purer who lose the good things
of time that they may gain those of eternity.  But the contempt and
ridicule of those who afflict and scorn them will be cast back upon
themselves, when their abundance shall change to want, and their pride
to confusion.
