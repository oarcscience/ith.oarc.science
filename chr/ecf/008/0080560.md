<span id="vi.iii.xii.lii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iii.xii.lii-p1.1"></span>Chapter LII.—Appion and Anubion.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.xii.lii-p2"></span>And when he had said this, and more
to the same purpose, and had cured some who were present who were infirm
and possessed of de<span id="page_206">p. 206</span> <span
id="vi.iii.xii.lii-Page_206"></span>mons, he dismissed the crowds, while
they gave thanks and praised God, charging them to come to the same
place on the following days also for the sake of hearing.  And when we
were together at home, and were preparing to eat, one entering told us
that Appion Pleistonices, <span id="fr_880"></span>[881](#fn_880) with
Anubion, were lately come from Antioch, and were lodging with
Simon. <span id="fr_881"></span>[882](#fn_881)   Then my father, when he
heard this, rejoiced, and said to Peter:  “If you permit me, I should
like to go and salute Appion and Anubion, for they are great friends of
mine; and perhaps I shall be able to persuade Anubion to dispute with
Clement on the subject of <span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iii.xii.lii-p4.1"></span>Genesis</span>.”  Then Peter said:  “I
consent; and I commend you, because you respect your friends.  But
consider how all things occur to you according to your wish by God’s
providence; for, behold, not only have *the objects* *of* proper
affection been restored to you by the appointment of God, but also the
presence of your friends is arranged for you.”  Then said my father: 
“Truly I consider that it is so as you say.”  And when he had said this,
he went away to Anubion.

<span id="vi.iii.xii.lii-p3"></span> The name is generally written
Apion.  The meaning of Pleistonices is doubtful, some supposing that it
indicates his birthplace, some his father; but generally it is taken as
an epithet, and it will then refer to his frequent victories in literary
contests.  \[See Homily IV. 3, and the discussions with Appion which
follow in that homily and in V., VI.—R.\]

<span id="vi.iii.xii.lii-p4"></span> \[From this point the resemblance
to the close of Homily XX. (chaps. 11–22) is quite marked.  But in the
*Recognitions* the conclusion is more detailed and complete; see chap.
65.  This is in accordance with the general design of this narrative,
which gives greater prominence to the family of Clement.—R.\]
