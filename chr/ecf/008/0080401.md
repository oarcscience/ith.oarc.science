id="vi.iii.ix.xxxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXIV.—Baptism Must Be Preceded
by Fasting.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.ix.xxxiv-p2"></span>When Niceta had spoken thus, our
mother fell down at Peter’s feet, entreating and beseeching him that
both herself and her hostess might be baptized without delay; “that,”
said she, “I may not even for a single day suffer the loss of the
company and society of my sons.”  In like manner, we her sons also
entreated Peter.  But he said:  “What!  Do you think that I alone am
unpitiful, and that I do not wish you to enjoy your mother’s society at
meals?  But she must fast at least one day first, and so be baptized;
and this because I have heard from her a certain declaration, by which
her faith has been made manifest to me, and which has given evidence of
her belief; otherwise she must have been instructed and taught many days
before she could have been baptized.”
