id="vii.xvi.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter 10 (26).</span>

<span id="vii.xvi.x-p2"></span>And while the saints Enoch and Elias were
thus speaking, behold, there came up another man, most wretched,
carrying on his shoulders the sign of the cross.  And seeing him, all
the saints said to him:  Who art thou? because thy appearance is that of
a robber.  And what is the sign which thou carriest on thy shoulders? 
In answer to them, he said:  Truly have you said that I was a robber,
doing all sorts of evil upon the earth.  And the Jews crucified me along
with Jesus; and I saw the miracles in created things which were done
through the cross of Jesus crucified, and I believed Him to be the
Creator of all created things, and the King omnipotent; and I entreated
Him, saying, Be mindful of me, Lord, when Thou shalt have come into Thy
kingdom.  Immediately He accepted my entreaty, and said to me, Amen; I
say to thee, To-day shalt thou be with me in paradise. <span
id="fr_1995"></span>[1996](#fn_1995.md)   And He gave me this sign of the
cross, saying, Walk into paradise carrying this; and if the guardian
angel of paradise will not let thee go in, show him the sign of the
cross, and thou shalt say to him, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who has
now been crucified, has sent me.  Having done so, I said all this to the
guardian angel of paradise.  And when he heard this, he immediately
opened, and led me in, and placed me at the right of paradise, saying,
Lo, hold a little, and there will come in the father of the whole human
race, Adam, with all his children, holy and just, after the triumph and
glory of the ascension of Christ the crucified Lord.  Hearing all these
words of the robber, all the holy patriarchs and prophets with one voice
said:  Blessed art Thou, O Lord Almighty, Father of everlasting
benefits, and Father of mercies, who hast given such grace to Thy
sinners, and hast brought them back into the grace of paradise, and into
Thy rich pastures; for this is spiritual life most sure.  Amen, amen.
