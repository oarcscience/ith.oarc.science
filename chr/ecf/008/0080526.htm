<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.xii.xviii-p2"></A>&#8220;Of all these, the first-born of the heaven took to wife the first-born of earth; the second the second, and in like manner all the rest.&#160; The first male, therefore, who had married the first female, was on her account drawn downwards; but the second female rose upwards, by reason of him to whom she was married; and so each doing in their order, remained in those places which fell to their share by the nuptial lot.&#160; From their intercourse they assert that innumerable others sprang.&#160; But of these six males, the one who is called Saturn received in marriage Rhea, and having been warned by a certain oracle that he who should be born of her should be more powerful than himself, and should drive him from his kingdom, he determined to devour all the sons that should be born to him.&#160; First, then, there is born to him a son called Aides, who amongst us is called Orcus; and him, for the reason we have just stated, he took and devoured.&#160; After him he begot a second son, called Neptune; and him he devoured in like manner.&#160; Last of all, he begot him whom they call Jupiter; but him his mother Rhea pitying, by stratagem withdrew from his father when he was about to devour him.&#160; And first, indeed, that the crying of the child might not be noticed, she made certain Corybantes strike cymbals and drums, that by the deafening sound the crying of the infant might not be heard.</p>
