id="vi.iv.xiv.xxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVIII.—Purification.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xiv.xxviii-p2"></span>“However, it is necessary to add
something to these things which has not community with man, but is
peculiar to the worship of God.  I mean purification, not approaching to
a man’s own wife when she is in separation, for so the law of God
commands.  But what?  If purity be not added to the service of God, you
would roll pleasantly like the dung-flies.  Wherefore as man, having
something more than the irrational animals, namely, rationality, purify
your hearts from evil by heavenly reasoning, and wash your bodies in the
bath.  For purification according to the truth is not that the purity of
the body precedes purification after the heart, but that purity follows
goodness.  For our Teacher also, *dealing with* certain of the Pharisees
and Scribes among us, who are separated, and as Scribes know the matters
of the law more than others, still He reproved them as hypocrites,
because they cleansed only the things that appear to men, but omitted
purity of heart and the things seen by God alone.
