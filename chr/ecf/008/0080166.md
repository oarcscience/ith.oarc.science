id="vi.iii.iv.xxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIX.—Peace and Strife.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iv.xxix-p2"></span>“Thus, therefore, our Master,
inviting His disciples to patience, impressed upon them that the
blessing of peace was also to be preserved with the labour of patience. 
But, on the other hand, He mourned over those who lived in riches and
luxury, who bestowed nothing upon the poor; proving that they must
render an account, because they did not pity their neighbours, even when
they were in poverty, whom they ought to love as themselves.  And by
such sayings as these He brought some indeed to obey Him, but others He
rendered hostile.  The believers therefore, and the obedient, He charges
to have peace among themselves. and says to them, ‘Blessed are the
peacemakers, for they shall be called the very sons of God.’ <span
id="fr_621"></span>[622](#fn_621.md)   But to those who not only did not
believe, but set themselves in opposition to His doctrine, He proclaims
the war of the word and of confutation, and says that ‘henceforth ye
shall see son separated from father, and husband from wife, and daughter
from mother, and brother from brother, and daughter-in-law from
mother-in-law, and a man’s foes shall be they of his own house.’ <span
id="fr_622"></span>[623](#fn_622.md)   For in every house, when there
begins to be a difference betwixt believer and unbeliever, there is
necessarily a contest:  the unbelievers, on the one hand, fighting
against the faith; and the believers on the other, confuting the old
error and the vices of sins in them.”
