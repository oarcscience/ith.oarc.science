of Good and Evil.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.x.xlvi-p2"></span>“But we shall discourse at greater
length on these subjects at another time.  Now, meantime, *we remark
that* though he is that good servant for regulating the changes of the
seasons, yet, when chastisement is inflicted upon men according to the
will of God, he glows more fiercely, and burns up the world with more
vehement fires.  In like manner also the course of the moon, and that
changing which seems to the unskilful to be disorderly, is adapted to
the growth of crops, and cattle, and all living creatures; for by her
waxings and wanings, by a certain wonderful contrivance of providence,
everything that is born is nourished and grows; concerning which we
could speak more at length and unfold the matter in detail, but that the
method of the question proposed recalls us.  Yet, by the very same
appliances by which they are produced, all things are nourished and
increased; but when, from any just cause, the regulation of the ap<span

and distemper arise, so that chastisement may come upon men by the will
of God, as we have said above.
