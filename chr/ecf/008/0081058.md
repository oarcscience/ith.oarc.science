<span id="vi.iv.xix.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.xix.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI.—Simon Appeals to the Old
Testament to Prove that There are Many Gods.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xix.vi-p2"></span>“For instance, in the very first words
of the law, He evidently speaks of them as being like even unto
Himself.  For thus it is written, that, when the first man received a
commandment from God to eat of every tree that was in the garden, <span
id="fr_1254"></span>[1255](#fn_1254.md) but not to eat of the tree of the
knowledge of good and evil, the serpent having persuaded them by means
of the woman, through the promise that they would become gods, made them
look up; <span id="fr_1255"></span>[1256](#fn_1255.md) and then, when they
had thus looked up, God said, <span id="fr_1256"></span>[1257](#fn_1256.md)
‘Behold, Adam is become as one of us.’  When, then, the serpent
said, <span id="fr_1257"></span>[1258](#fn_1257.md) ‘Ye shall be as gods,’
he plainly speaks in the belief that gods exist; all the more as God
also added His testimony, saying, ‘Behold, Adam is become as one of
us.’  The serpent, then, who said that there are many gods, did not
speak falsely.  Again, the scripture, <span
id="fr_1258"></span>[1259](#fn_1258.md) ‘Thou shalt not revile the gods,
nor curse the rulers of thy people,’ points out many gods whom it does
not wish even to be cursed.  But it is also somewhere else
written, <span id="fr_1259"></span>[1260](#fn_1259.md) ‘Did another god
dare to enter and take him a nation from the midst of another nation, as
did I the Lord God?’  When He says, ‘Did another God dare?’ He speaks on
the supposition that other gods exist.  And elsewhere: <span
id="fr_1260"></span>[1261](#fn_1260.md)   ‘Let the gods that have not made
the heavens and the earth perish;’ as if those who had made them were
not to perish.  And in another place, when it says, <span
id="fr_1261"></span>[1262](#fn_1261.md) ‘Take heed to thyself lest thou go
and serve other gods whom thy fathers knew not,’ it speaks as if other
gods existed whom they were not to follow.  And again: <span
id="fr_1262"></span>[1263](#fn_1262.md)   ‘The names of other gods shall
not ascend upon thy lips.’  Here it mentions many gods whose names it
does not wish to be uttered.  And again it is written, <span
id="fr_1263"></span>[1264](#fn_1263.md) ‘Thy God is the Lord, He is God of
gods.’  And again: <span id="fr_1264"></span>[1265](#fn_1264.md)   ‘Who is
like unto Thee, O Lord, among the Gods?’  And again: <span
id="fr_1265"></span>[1266](#fn_1265.md)   ‘God is Lord of gods.’  And
again: <span id="fr_1266"></span>[1267](#fn_1266.md)   ‘God stood in the
assembly of gods:  He judgeth among the gods.’  Wherefore I wonder how,
when there are so many passages in writing which testify that there are
many gods, you have asserted that we ought neither to say nor to think
that there are many. <span id="fr_1267"></span>[1268](#fn_1267.md)  
Finally, if you have anything to say against what has been spoken so
distinctly, say it in the presence of all.”

look up, or to recover one’s sight.  Possibly the second meaning is the
one intended here, corresponding to the words of our version:  “Then
your eyes shall be opened.”
