<span id="vi.iv.xviii.iii-p2"></span>And our father said:  “There is
evidently much reason in what you say.”  And Peter said:  “What is it,
then, that prevents you from coming to our faith?  Tell me, that we may
begin our discussion with it.  For many are the hindrances.  The
faithful are hindered by occupation with merchandise, or public
business, or the cultivation of the soil, or cares, and such like; the
unbelievers, of whom you also are one, are hindered by ideas such as
that the gods, which do not exist, really exist, or that all things are
subject to Genesis, or chance, <span

our doctrines are false because there is no providence.
