<span id="vi.iv.xix.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.xix.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—Simon and Peter Continue
the Discussion.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xix.viii-p2"></span>And Simon said:  “My original
stipulation with you was that I should prove from the Scriptures that
you were wrong in maintaining that we ought not to speak of many gods.” 
Accordingly I adduced many written passages to show that the divine
Scriptures themselves speak of many gods.”  And Peter said:  “Those very
Scriptures which speak of many gods, also exhorted us, saying, ‘The
names of other gods shall not ascend upon thy lips.’ <span
id="fr_1275"></span>[1276](#fn_1275.md)   Thus, Simon, I did not speak
contrary to what was written.”  And Simon said:  “Do you, Peter, listen
to what I have to say.  You seem to me to sin in speaking against
them, <span id="fr_1276"></span>[1277](#fn_1276.md) when the Scripture
says, <span id="fr_1277"></span>[1278](#fn_1277.md) ‘Thou shalt not revile
*the gods*, nor curse the rulers of thy people.’”  And Peter said:  “I
am not sinning, Simon, in pointing out their destruction according to
the Scriptures; for thus it is written: <span
id="fr_1278"></span>[1279](#fn_1278.md)   ‘Let the gods who did not make
the heavens and the earth perish.’  And He said thus, not as though
<span class="c9"><span id="vi.iv.xix.viii-p6.2"></span>some</span> had
made the heavens and were not to perish, as you interpreted the
passage.  For it is plainly declared that He who made them is one in the
very first part of Scripture: <span id="fr_1279"></span>[1280](#fn_1279.md)
  ‘In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.  And it did
not say, ‘the gods.’  And somewhere else it says, <span
id="fr_1280"></span>[1281](#fn_1280.md) ‘And the firmament showeth His
handiwork.’  And in another place it is written, <span
id="fr_1281"></span>[1282](#fn_1281.md) ‘The heavens themselves shall
perish, but Thou shalt remain for ever.’”
