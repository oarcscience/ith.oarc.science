<span id="vi.iii.v.lii-p2"></span>But Peter said:  “Who is he that is
earnest toward instruction, and that studiously inquires into every
particular, except him who loves his own soul to salvation, and
renounces all the affairs of this world, that he may have leisure to
attend to the word of God only?  Such is he whom alone the true Prophet
deems wise, even he who sells all that he has and buys the one true
pearl, <span id="fr_707"></span>[708](#fn_707) who understands what is
the difference between temporal things and eternal, small and great, men
and God.  For he understands what is the eternal hope in presence of the
true and good God.  But who is he that loves God, save him who knows His
wisdom?  And how can any one obtain knowledge of God’s wisdom, unless he
be constant in hearing His word?  Whence it comes, that he conceives a
love for Him, and venerates Him with worthy honour, pouring out hymns
and prayers to Him, and most pleasantly resting in these, accounteth it
his greatest damage if at any time he speak or do aught else even for a
moment of time; because, in reality, the soul which is filled with the
love of God can neither look upon anything except what pertains to God,
nor, by reason of love of Him, can be satisfied with meditating upon
those things which it knows to be pleasing to Him.  But those who have
not conceived affection for Him, nor bear His love lighted up in their
mind, are as it were placed in darkness and cannot see light; and
therefore, even before they begin to learn anything of God, they
immediately faint as though worn out by labour; and filled with
weariness, they are straightway hurried by their own peculiar habits to
those words with which they are pleased.  For it is wearisome and
annoying to such persons to hear anything about God; and that for the
reason I have stated, because their mind has received no sweetness of
divine love.”
