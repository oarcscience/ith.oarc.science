<span id="vi.iv.xiii.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.xiii.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XV.—Its Inconclusiveness.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xiii.xv-p2"></span>“For if you say that, after the
manner of Cæsar, God has subordinate powers—those, namely, which are
called gods—you do not thus go by your illustration.  For if you went by
it, you must of necessity know that it is not lawful to give the name of
Cæsar to another, whether he be consul, or prefect, or captain, or any
one else, and that he who gives such a name shall not live, and he who
takes it shall be cut off.  Thus, according to your own illustration,
the name of God must not be given to another; and he who is tempted
either to take or give it is destroyed.  Now, if this insult of a man
induces punishment, much more they who call others gods shall be subject
to eternal punishment, as insulting God.  And with good reason; because
you subject to all the insult that you can the name which it was
committed to you to honour, in order to His monarchy.  For <span
class="c9"><span id="vi.iv.xiii.xv-p2.1"></span>God</span> is not
properly His name; but you having in the meantime received it, insult
what has been given you, that it may be accounted as done against the
real name, according as you use that.  But you subject it to every kind
of insult.
