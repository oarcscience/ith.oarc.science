id="vi.iv.xv.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI.—The Afflictions of the
Righteous.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xv.xi-p2"></span>But Peter, hearing this, wept through
sympathy, and immediately said to the gentlemen who were present:  “If
any worshipper of God had suffered these things, such as this man’s
father hath suffered, he would immediately have assigned the cause of it
to be his worship of God, ascribing it to the wicked one.  Thus also it
is the lot of the wretched Gentiles to suffer; and we worshippers of God
know it not.  But with good reason I call them wretched, because here
they are ensnared, and the hope that is thine they obtain not.  For
those who in the worship of God suffer afflictions, suffer them for the
expiation of their transgressions.”
