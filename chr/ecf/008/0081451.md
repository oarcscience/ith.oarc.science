<span id="ix.v.i-p7"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="ix.v.i-p7.1"></span>And</span>, when he had entered the sepulchre,
he was raised to life again, and came forth from the sepulchre with
many.  And those who were guarding the sepulchre saw not how He came
forth from the sepulchre; but the watchers from on high—they were the
proclaimers and announcers of His resurrection.  For, had He not willed,
He had not died, because He is Lord of death, the exit from *this life*;
nor, had it not pleased Him, would He have put on a body, inasmuch as He
is Himself the framer of the body.  For that will which led Him to stoop
to be born of the Virgin, likewise caused Him further to descend to the
suffering of death.—*And a little after* (*we read*):  For, although His
appearance was that of men, yet His power, and His knowledge, and his
authority, were those of God.
