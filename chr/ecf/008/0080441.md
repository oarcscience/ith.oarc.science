id="vi.iii.x.xxxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXV.—A Contest of
Hospitality.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.x.xxxv-p2"></span>When Niceta had thus spoken, the old
man answered:  “You indeed, my son, have conducted your argument wisely
and vigorously; so much so, that I do not think the subject of
providence could be better treated.  But as it is now late, I wish to
say some things to-morrow in answer to what you have argued; and if on
these you can satisfy me, I shall confess myself a debtor to your
favour.”  And when the old man said this, Peter rose up.  Then one of
those present, a chief man of the Laodiceans, requested of Peter and us
that he might give the old man other clothes instead of the mean and
torn ones that he wore. <span id="fr_817"></span>[818](#fn_817)   This
man Peter and we embraced; and praising him for his honourable and
excellent intention, said:  “We are not so foolish and impious as not to
bestow the things which are necessary for bodily uses upon him to whom
we have committed so precious words; and we hope that he will willingly
receive them, as a father from his sons, and also we trust that he will
share with us our house and our living.”  While we said this, and that
chief man of the city strove to take the old man away from us with the
greatest urgency and with many blandishments, while we the more eagerly
strove to keep him with us, all the people cried out that it should
rather be done as the old man himself pleased; and when silence was
obtained, the old man, with an oath, said:  “To-day I shall stay with no
<span id="page_175">p. 175</span> <span
id="vi.iii.x.xxxv-Page_175"></span>one, nor take anything from any one,
lest the choice of the one should prove the sorrow of the other;
afterwards these things may be, if so it seem right.”

*Recognitions*.  There seems to be a reminiscence of this chief man in
Homily IV. 10, where a rich man provides a place for the discussion;
