id="vii.v.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 18.</span>

<span id="vii.v.xix-p2"></span>And having come to a certain cave, and
wishing to rest in it, the blessed <span
id="fr_1659"></span>[1660](#fn_1659.md) Mary dismounted from her beast, and
sat down with the child Jesus in her bosom.  And there were with Joseph
three boys, and with Mary a girl, going on the journey along with them. 
And, lo, suddenly there came forth from the cave many dragons; and when
the children saw them, they cried out in great terror.  Then Jesus went
down from the bosom of His mother, and stood on His feet before the
dragons; and they adored Jesus, and thereafter retired.  Then was
fulfilled that which was said by David the prophet, saying:  Praise the
Lord from the earth, ye dragons; ye dragons, and all ye deeps. <span
id="fr_1660"></span>[1661](#fn_1660.md)   And the young child Jesus,
walking before them, commanded them to hurt no man.  But Mary and Joseph
were very much afraid lest the child should be hurt by the dragons.  And
Jesus said to them:  Do not be afraid, and do not consider me to be a
little child; for I am and always have been perfect; and all the beasts
of the forest must needs be tame before me.

virgin and the boy upon a beast, and himself mounted another, and took
the road through the hill country and the desert, that he might get safe
to Egypt; for they did not want to go by the shore, for fear of being
waylaid.
