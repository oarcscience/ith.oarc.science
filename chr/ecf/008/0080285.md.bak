Enjoyment.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.vi.ix-p2"></span>“When God had made man after His own
image and likeness, He grafted into His work a certain breathing and
odour of His divinity, that so men, being made partakers of His
Only-begotten, might through Him be also friends of God and sons of
adoption.  Whence also He Himself, as the true Prophet, knowing with
what actions the Father is pleased, instructed them in what way they
might obtain that privilege.  At that time, therefore, there was among
men only one worship of God—a pure mind and an uncorrupted spirit.  And
for this reason every creature kept an inviolable covenant with the
human race.  For by reason of their reverence of the Creator, no
sickness, or bodily disorder, or corruption of food, had power over
them; <span id="page_137">p. 137</span> <span
id="vi.iii.vi.ix-Page_137"></span>whence it came to pass, that a life of
a thousand years did not fall into the frailty of old age.
