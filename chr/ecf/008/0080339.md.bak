id="vi.iii.vii.xxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXV.—Fifth Suggestion.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.vii.xxv-p2"></span>“But you say:  Then those who adore
what ought not to be adored, should be immediately destroyed by God, to
prevent others doing the like.  But are you wiser than God, that you
should offer Him counsel? <span id="fr_766"></span>[767](#fn_766.md)   He
knows what to do.  For with all who are placed in ignorance He exercises
patience, because He is merciful and gracious; and He foresees that many
of the ungodly become godly, and that even some of those who worship
impure statues and polluted images have been converted to God, and
forsaking their sins and doing good works, attain to salvation.  But it
is said:  We ought never to have come even to the thought of doing these
things.  You do not know what freedom of will is, and you forget that he
is good who is so by his own intention; but, he who is retained in
goodness by necessity cannot be called good, because it is not of
himself that he is so.  Because, therefore, there is in every one
liberty to choose good or evil, he either acquires rewards, or brings
destruction on himself.  Nay it is said, God brings to our minds
whatsoever we think.  What mean ye, O men?  Ye blaspheme.  For if He
brings all our thoughts into our minds, then it is He that suggests to
us thoughts of adultery, and covetousness, and blasphemy, and every kind
of effeminacy.  Cease, I entreat of you, these blasphemies, and
understand what is the honour worthy of God.  And say not, as some of
you are wont to say, that God needs not honour from men.  Indeed, He
truly is in need of none; but you ought to know that the honour which
you bestow upon God is profitable to yourselves.  For what is so
execrable, as for a man not to render thanks to his Creator?
