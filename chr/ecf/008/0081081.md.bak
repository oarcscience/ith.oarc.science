id="vi.iv.xx.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII.—Man in the Shape of
God.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xx.vii-p2"></span>“Knowing therefore that we knew all
that was spoken by Him, and that we could supply the proofs, He sent us
to the ignorant Gentiles to baptize them for remission of sins, and
commanded us to teach them first. <span
id="fr_1328"></span>[1329](#fn_1328.md)   Of His commandments this is the
first and great one, to fear the Lord God, and to serve Him only.  But
He meant us to fear that God whose angels they are who are the angels of
the least of the faithful amongst us, and who stand in heaven
continually beholding the face of the Father. <span
id="fr_1329"></span>[1330](#fn_1329.md)   For He has shape, and He has
every limb primarily and solely for beauty’s sake, and not for
use. <span id="fr_1330"></span>[1331](#fn_1330.md)   For He has not eyes
that He may see with them; for He sees on every side, since He is
incomparably more brilliant in His body than the visual spirit which is
in us, and He is more splendid than everything, so that in comparison
with Him the light of the sun may be reckoned as darkness.  Nor has He
ears that He may hear; for He hears, perceives, moves, energizes, acts
on every side.  But He has the most beautiful shape on account <span
id="page_320">p. 320</span> <span id="vi.iv.xx.vii-Page_320"></span>of
man, that the pure in heart <span id="fr_1331"></span>[1332](#fn_1331.md)
may be able to see Him, that they may rejoice because they suffered. 
For He moulded man in His own shape as in the grandest seal, in order
that he may be the ruler and lord of all, and that all may be subject to
him.  Wherefore, judging that He is the universe, and that man is His
image (for He is Himself invisible, but His image man is visible), the
man who wishes to worship Him honours His visible image, which is man. 
Whatsoever therefore any one does to man, be it good or bad, is regarded
as being done to Him.  Wherefore the judgment which proceeds from Him
shall go before, giving to every one according to his merits.  For He
avenges His own shape.
