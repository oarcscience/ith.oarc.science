id="vi.iii.v.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXII.—Peter’s Private
Instruction.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.v.xxii-p2"></span>When Peter spoke thus to us, every
one of us eagerly assured him, that ere now we were awake, being
satisfied with short sleep, but that we were afraid to arouse him,
because it did not become the disciples to command the master; “and yet
even this, O Peter, we had almost ventured to take upon ourselves,
because our hearts, agitated with longing for your words, drove sleep
wholly from our eyes.  But again our affection towards you opposed it,
and did not suffer us violently to rouse you.”  Then Peter said:  “Since
therefore you assert that you are willingly awake through desire of
hearing, I wish to repeat to you more carefully, and to explain in their
order, the things that were spoken yesterday without arrangement.  And
this I propose to do throughout these daily disputations, that by night,
when privacy of time and place is afforded, I shall unfold in correct
order, and by a straight line of explanation, anything that in the
controversy has not been stated with sufficient fulness.”  And then he
began to point out to us how the yesterday’s discussion ought to have
been conducted, and how it could not be so conducted on account of the
contentiousness or the unskilfulness of his opponent; and how therefore
he only made use of assertion, <span id="page_123">p. 123</span> <span
id="vi.iii.v.xxii-Page_123"></span>and only overthrew what was said by
his adversary, but did not expound his own doctrines either completely
or distinctly.  Then repeating the several matters to us, he discussed
them in regular order and with full reason.
