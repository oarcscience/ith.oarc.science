<span id="vii.vi.iv-p2"></span>Thereafter he appeared to Anna his wife,
saying:  Fear not, Anna, nor think that it is a phantom which thou
seest.  For I am that angel who has presented your prayers and alms
before God; and now have I been sent to you to announce to you that thou
shalt bring forth a daughter, who shall be called Mary, and who shall be
blessed above all women.  She, full of the favour of the Lord even from
her birth, shall remain three years in her father’s house until she be
weaned.  Thereafter, being delivered to the service of the Lord, she
shall not depart from the temple until she reach the years of
discretion.  There, in fine, serving God day and night in fastings and
prayers, she shall abstain from every unclean thing; she shall never
know man, but alone, without example, immaculate, uncorrupted, without
intercourse with man, she, a virgin, shall bring forth a son; she, His
hand-maiden, shall bring forth the Lord—both in grace, and in name, and
in work, the Saviour of the world.  Wherefore arise, and go up to
Jerusalem; and when thou shalt come to the gate which, because it is
plated with gold, is called Golden, there, for a sign, thou shalt meet
thy husband, for whose safety thou hast been anxious.  And when these
things shall have so happened, know that what I announce shall without
doubt be fulfilled.
