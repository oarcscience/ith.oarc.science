id="vi.iv.xxi.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIX.—Misconception of God in the
Old Testament.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxi.xix-p2"></span>“And some sinned thus, on account of
imagining that there would be no judgment <span
id="fr_1397"></span>[1398](#fn_1397) because of His goodness.  But
others took an opposite course.  For, supposing the expressions of the
Scriptures which are against God, and are unjust and false, to be true,
they did not know His real divinity and power.  Therefore, in the belief
that He was ignorant and rejoiced in murder, and let off the wicked in
consequence of the gifts of sacrifices; yea, moreover, that He deceived
and spake falsely, and did every thing that is unjust, they themselves
did things like to what their God did, and thus sinning, asserted that
they were acting piously.  Wherefore it was impossible for them to
change to the better, and when warned they took no heed.  For they were
not afraid, since they became like their God through such actions.

<span id="vi.iv.xxi.xix-p3"></span> We have adopted the Latin
translation here, as giving the meaning which was intended by the
writer:  but the Greek will scarcely admit of such a translation. 
Probably the text is corrupt, or something is omitted.  The literal
translation is, “in consequence of the unjudging supposition on account
of the goodness.”
