id="vi.iii.vii.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIII.—Invitation of the
Gentiles.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.vii.xiii-p2"></span>“Wherefore awake, and take to
yourselves our Lord and God, even that Lord who is Lord both of heaven
and earth, and conform yourselves to His image and likeness, as the true
Prophet Himself teaches, saying, ‘Be ye merciful, as also your heavenly
Father is merciful, who makes His sun to rise upon the good and the
evil, and rains upon the just and the unjust.’ <span
id="fr_758"></span>[759](#fn_758.md)   Imitate Him, therefore, and fear
Him, as the commandment is given to men, ‘Thou shalt worship the Lord
thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve.’ <span
id="fr_759"></span>[760](#fn_759.md)   For it is profitable to you to serve
this Lord alone, that through Him knowing the one God, ye may be freed
from the many whom ye vainly feared.  For he who fears not God the
Creator of all, but fears those whom he himself with his own hands hath
made, what does he do but make himself subject to a vain and senseless
fear, and render himself more vile and abject than those very things,
the fear of which he has conceived in his mind?  But rather, by the
goodness of Him who inviteth you, return to your former nobleness, and
by good deeds show that you bear the image of your Creator, that by
contemplation of His likeness ye may be believed to be even His sons.
