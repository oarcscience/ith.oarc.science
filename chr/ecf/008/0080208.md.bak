id="vi.iii.iv.lxxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter LXXI.—Separation from the
Unclean.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iv.lxxi-p2"></span>But Peter, most benignantly
regarding me, lest haply that separation might cause me sorrow, says to
me:  “It is not from pride, O Clement, that I do not eat with those who
have not yet been purified; but I fear lest perhaps I should injure
myself, and do no good to them. <span id="fr_670"></span>[671](#fn_670.md)
  For this I would have you know for certain, that every one who has at
any time worshipped idols, and has adored those whom the pagans call
gods, or has eaten of the things sacrificed to them, is not without an
unclean spirit; for he has become a guest of demons, and has been
partaker with that demon of which he has formed the image in his mind,
either through fear or love. <span id="fr_671"></span>[672](#fn_671.md)  
And by these means he is not free from an unclean spirit, and therefore
needs the purification of baptism, that the unclean spirit may go out of
him, which has made its abode in the inmost affections of his soul, and
what is worse, gives no indication that it lurks within, for fear it
should be exposed and expelled.”
