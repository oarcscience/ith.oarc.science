<p class="c21"><a name="vii.x.ii-p2"></A>And as Jesus was walking with Mary His mother through the middle of the city market-place, He looked and saw a schoolmaster teaching his scholars.&#160; And behold twelve sparrows that were quarrelling fell over the wall into the bosom of that schoolmaster, who was teaching the boys.&#160; And seeing this, Jesus was very much amused, and stood still.&#160; And when that teacher saw Him making merry, he said to his scholars with great fury:&#160; Go and bring him to me.&#160; And when they had carried Him to the master, he seized Him by the ear, and said:&#160; What didst thou see, to amuse thee so much?&#160; And He said to him:&#160; Master, see my hand full of wheat.&#160; I showed it to them, and scattered the wheat among them, and they carry it out of the middle of the street where they are in danger; and on this account they fought among themselves to divide the wheat.&#160; And Jesus did not pass from the place until it was accomplished.&#160; And this being done, the master began to thrust Him out of the city, along with His mother.</p>
