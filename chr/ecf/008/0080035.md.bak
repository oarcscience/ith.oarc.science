<span id="v.iii.x-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iii.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter X.—Denunciation of Dangerous and
Scandalous Association with Maidens.</span>

<span id="v.iii.x-p2"></span>Now, we are persuaded of you, my brethren,
that your thoughts are occupied about those things which are requisite
for your salvation. <span id="fr_378"></span>[379](#fn_378.md)   But we
speak thus <span id="fr_379"></span>[380](#fn_379.md) in consequence of the
evil rumours and reports concerning shameless men, who, under pretext of
the fear of God, have their dwelling with maidens, and *so,* expose
themselves to danger, and walk with them along the road and in solitary
places <span id="fr_380"></span>[381](#fn_380.md) alone—a course which is
full of dangers, and full of stumbling-blocks and snares and pitfalls;
nor is it in any respect right for Christians and those who fear God so
to conduct themselves.  Others, too, eat and drink with them at
entertainments *allowing themselves* in loose behaviour and much
uncleanness—such as ought not to be among believers, and especially
among those who have chosen for themselves *a life of* holiness. <span
id="fr_381"></span>[382](#fn_381.md)   Others, again, meet together for
vain and trifling conversation and merriment, and that they may speak
evil of one another; and they hunt up tales against one another, and are
idle:  persons with whom we do not allow you even to eat bread.  Then,
others gad about among the houses of virgin brethren or sisters, on
pretence of visiting them, or reading the Scriptures *to them*, or
exorcising them.  Forasmuch as they are idle and do no work, they pry
into those things which ought not to be inquired into, and by means of
plausible words make merchandise of the name of Christ.  *These are* men
from whom the divine apostle kept aloof, because of the multitude of
their evil *deeds*; as it is written:  “Thorns sprout in the hands of
the idle;” <span id="fr_382"></span>[383](#fn_382.md) and, “The ways of the
idle are full of thorns.” <span id="fr_383"></span>[384](#fn_383.md)
