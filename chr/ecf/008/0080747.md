Appointed.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.vi.lx-p2"></span>“Since, therefore, it is necessary to
set apart some one instead of me to fill my place, let us all with one
consent pray to God, that He would make manifest who amongst us is the
best, that, sitting in the chair of Christ, he may piously rule His
Church.  Who, then, shall be set apart?  For by the counsel of God that
man is set forth as blessed, ‘whom his Lord shall appoint over the
ministry of his fellow-servants, to give them their meat in their
season, not thinking and saying in his heart, My Lord delayeth His
coming, and who shall not begin to beat his fellow-servants, eating and
drinking with harlots and drunkards.  And the Lord of that servant shall
come in an hour when he doth not look for Him, and in a day when he is
not aware, and shall cut him in sunder, and shall assign his unfaithful
part with the hypocrites.’ <span id="fr_1020"></span>[1021](#fn_1020)
