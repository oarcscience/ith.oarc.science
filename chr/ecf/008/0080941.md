<span id="vi.iv.xiv.vii-p2"></span>“But it will be said that the
worshippers themselves ought to be taken away by the true God, that
others may not do it.  But you are not wiser than God, that you should
give Him counsel as one more prudent than He.  He knows what He does;
for He is long-suffering to all who are in impiety, as a merciful and
philanthropic father, knowing that impious men become pious.  And of
those very worshippers of base and senseless things, many becoming sober
have ceased to worship these things and to sin, and many Greeks have
been saved so as to pray to the true God.
