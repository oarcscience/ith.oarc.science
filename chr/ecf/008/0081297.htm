<p class="c21"><a name="vii.xiv.ix-p2"></A>And setting out to paradise, He took hold of our forefather Adam by the hand, and delivered him, and all the just, to the archangel Michael.&#160; And as they were going into the door of paradise, there met them two old men, to whom the holy fathers said:&#160; Who are you, who have not seen death, and have not come down into Hades, but who dwell in paradise in your bodies and your souls?&#160; One of them answered, and said:&#160; I am Enoch, who was well-pleasing to God, and who was translated hither by Him; and this is Helias the Thesbite; and we are also to live until the end of the world; and then we are to be sent by God to withstand Antichrist, and to be slain by him, and after three days to rise again, and to be snatched up in clouds to meet the Lord.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1950"></A><A HREF="#fn_1950"><FONT SIZE="1">1951</FONT></A>
