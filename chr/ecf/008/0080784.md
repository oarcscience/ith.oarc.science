id="vi.iv.vii.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIII.—“Whither Shall I Go from
Thy Presence?”</span>

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xxiii-p2"></span>When I had thus spoken, Appion
broke in upon my discourse.  “What!” said he; “do not the laws of the
Greeks also forbid wickedness, and punish adulterers?”  Then said I: 
“Then the gods of the Greeks, who acted contrary to the laws, deserve
punishment.  But how shall I be able to restrain myself, if I suppose
that the gods themselves first practised all wickednesses as well as
adultery, and did not suffer punishment; whereas they ought the rather
to have suffered, as not being slaves to lust?  But if they were subject
to it, how were they gods?”  <span id="page_256">p. 256</span> <span
id="vi.iv.vii.xxiii-Page_256"></span>Then Appion said:  “Let us have in
our eye not the gods, but the judges; and looking to them, we shall be
afraid to sin.”  Then I said:  “This is not fitting, O Appion:  for he
who has his eye upon men will dare to sin, in hope of escaping
detection; but he who sets before his soul the all-seeing God, knowing
that he cannot escape His notice, will refrain from sinning even in
secret.”
