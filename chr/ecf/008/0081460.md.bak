<span id="ix.vi.i-p3"></span><span class="c6"><span
id="ix.vi.i-p3.1"></span>The Teaching of Addæus the Apostle. <span
id="fr_2959"></span>[2960](#fn_2959.md) </span>

<span id="ix.vi.i-p6"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="ix.vi.i-p6.1"></span>Addæus <span
id="fr_2960"></span>[2961](#fn_2960.md) </span> said to him:  Because thou
hast thus believed, I lay my hand upon thee in the name of Him in whom
thou hast thus believed.  And at the very moment that he laid his hand
upon him he was healed of the plague of the disease which he had for a
long time. <span id="fr_2961"></span>[2962](#fn_2961.md)   And Abgar was
astonished and marvelled, because, like as he had heard about Jesus, how
He wrought and healed, so Addæus also, without any medicine whatever,
was healing in the name of Jesus.  And Abdu also, son of Abdu, had the
gout in his feet; and he also presented his feet to him, and he laid his
hand upon them, and healed him, and he had the gout no more.  And in all
the city also he wrought great cures, and showed forth wonderful
mighty-works in it.

<span id="ix.vi.i-p9"></span>Abgar said to him:  Now that every man
knoweth that by the power of Jesus Christ thou doest these miracles, and
lo! we are astonished at thy deeds, I therefore entreat of thee to
relate to us the story about the coming of Christ, in what manner it
was, and about His glorious power, and about the miracles which we have
heard that He did, which thou hast thyself seen, together with thy
fellow-disciples.

<span id="ix.vi.i-p10"></span>Addæus said:  I will not hold my peace
from declaring this; since for this very purpose was I sent hither, that
I might speak to and teach every one who is willing to believe, even as
thou.  Assemble me tomorrow all the city, and I will sow in it the word
of life by the preaching which I will address to you—about the coming of
Christ, in what manner it was; and about Him that sent Him, why and how
He sent Him; and about His power and His wonderful works; and about the
glorious mysteries of His coming, which He spake of in the world; and
about the unerring truth <span id="fr_2962"></span>[2963](#fn_2962.md) of
His preaching; and how and for what cause He abused Himself, and humbled
His exalted Godhead by the manhood which He took, and was crucified, and
descended to the place of the dead, and broke through the
enclosure <span id="fr_2963"></span>[2964](#fn_2963.md) which had never
been broken through *before*, and gave life to the dead by being slain
Himself, and descended alone, and ascended with many to His glorious
Father, with whom He had been from eternity in one exalted Godhead.

<span id="ix.vi.i-p13"></span>And Abgar commanded them to give to Addæus
silver and gold.  Addæus said to him:  How can we receive that which is
not ours.  For, lo! that which was ours have we forsaken, as we were
commanded by our Lord; because without purses and without scrips,
bearing the cross upon our shoulders, were we commanded to preach His
Gospel in the whole creation, of whose crucifixion, which was for our
sakes, for the redemption of all men, the whole creation was sensible
and suffered pain.

<span id="ix.vi.i-p14"></span>And he related before Abgar the king, and
before his princes and his nobles, and before Augustin, Abgar’s mother,
and before Shalmath, <span id="fr_2964"></span>[2965](#fn_2964.md) the
daughter of Meherdath, <span id="fr_2965"></span>[2966](#fn_2965.md)
Abgar’s wife, <span id="fr_2966"></span>[2967](#fn_2966.md) the signs of
our Lord, and His wonders, and the glorious mighty-works which He did,
and His divine exploits, and His ascension to His Father; and how they
had received power and authority at the same time that He was received
up—by which same power it was that he had healed Abgar, and Abdu son of
Abdu, the second person <span id="fr_2967"></span>[2968](#fn_2967.md) of
his kingdom; and how He informed them that He would reveal Himself at
the end of the ages <span id="fr_2968"></span>[2969](#fn_2968.md) and at
the consummation of all created things; also *of* the resuscitation and
resurrection which is to come for all men, and <span id="page_658">p.
658</span> <span id="ix.vi.i-Page_658"></span>the separation which will
be made between the sheep and the goats, and between the faithful and
those who believe not.

<span id="ix.vi.i-p20"></span>And he said to them:  Because the gate of
life is strait and the way of truth narrow, therefore are the believers
of the truth few, and through unbelief is Satan’s gratification. 
Therefore are the liars many who lead astray those that see.  For, were
it not that there is a good end awaiting believing men, our Lord would
not have descended from heaven, and come to be born, and to *endure* the
suffering of death.  Yet He did come, and us did He send <span
id="fr_2969"></span>[2970](#fn_2969.md) …of the faith which we preach, that
God was crucified for <span id="fr_2970"></span>[2971](#fn_2970.md) all
men.

<span id="ix.vi.i-p23"></span>And, if there be those who are not
willing <span id="fr_2971"></span>[2972](#fn_2971.md) to agree with these
our words, let them draw near to us and disclose to us what is in their
mind, that, like as in the case of a disease, we may apply to their
thoughts healing medicine for the cure of their ailments.  For, though
ye were not present at the time of Christ’s suffering, yet from the sun
which was darkened, and which ye saw, learn ye and understand concerning
the great convulsion <span id="fr_2972"></span>[2973](#fn_2972.md) which
took place at that time, when He was crucified whose Gospel has winged
its way through all the earth by the signs which His disciples my
fellows do in all the earth:  yea, those who were Hebrews, and knew only
the language of the Hebrews, in which they were born, lo! at this day
are speaking in all languages, in order that those who are afar off may
hear and believe, even as those who are near.  For He it is that
confounded the tongues of the presumptuous in this region who were
before us; and He it is that teaches at this day the faith of truth and
verity by us, humble and despicable <span
id="fr_2973"></span>[2974](#fn_2973.md) men from Galilee of Palestine.  For
I also whom ye see am from Paneas, <span
id="fr_2974"></span>[2975](#fn_2974.md) from the place where the river
Jordan issues forth, and I was chosen, together with my fellows, to be a
preacher.

<span id="ix.vi.i-p28"></span>For, according as my Lord commanded me,
lo! I preach and publish the Gospel, and lo! His money do I cast upon
the table before you, and the seed of His word do I sow in the ears of
all men; and such as are willing to receive it, theirs is the good
recompense of the confession *of Christ;* but those who are not
persuaded, the dust of my feet do I shake off against them, as He
commanded me.

<span id="ix.vi.i-p29"></span>Repent therefore, my beloved, of evil ways
and of abominable deeds, and turn yourselves towards Him with a good and
honest will, as He hath turned Himself towards you with the favour of
His rich mercies; and be ye not as the generations of former times that
have passed away, which, because they hardened their heart against the
fear of God, received punishment openly, that they themselves might be
chastised, and that those who come after them may tremble and be
afraid.  For the purpose of our Lord’s coming into the world assuredly
was, <span id="fr_2975"></span>[2976](#fn_2975.md) that He might teach us
and show us that at the consummation of the creation there will be a
resuscitation of all men, and that at that time their course of conduct
will be portrayed in their persons, and their bodies will be volumes for
the writings of justice; nor will any one be there who is unacquainted
with books, because every one will read that which is written in His own
book. <span id="fr_2976"></span>[2977](#fn_2976.md)

<span id="ix.vi.i-p32"></span>Ye that have eyes, forasmuch as ye do not
perceive, are yourselves also become like those who see not and hear
not; and in vain do your ineffectual voices strain themselves to
deaf <span id="fr_2977"></span>[2978](#fn_2977.md) ears.  Whilst *they* are
not to be blamed for not hearing, because they are by <span
id="fr_2978"></span>[2979](#fn_2978.md) nature deaf and dumb, yet the blame
which is justly incurred falls upon you, <span
id="fr_2979"></span>[2980](#fn_2979.md) because ye are not willing to
perceive—not even that which ye see.  For the dark cloud of error which
overspreads your minds suffers you not to obtain the heavenly light,
which is the understanding of knowledge. <span
id="fr_2980"></span>[2981](#fn_2980.md)

<span id="ix.vi.i-p38"></span>Flee, then, from things made and created,
as I said to you, which are only called gods in name, whilst they are
not gods in their nature; and draw near to this *Being*, who in His
nature is God from everlasting and from eternity, and is not something
made, like your idols, nor is He a creature and a work of art, like
those images in which ye glory.  Because, although this <span
id="fr_2981"></span>[2982](#fn_2981.md) *Being* put on a body, *yet* is He
God with His Father.  For the works of creation, which trembled when He
was slain and were dismayed at His suffering of death,—these bear
witness that He is Himself God the Creator.  For it was not on account
of a man that the earth trembled, <span
id="fr_2982"></span>[2983](#fn_2982.md) but on ac<span id="page_659">p.
659</span> <span id="ix.vi.i-Page_659"></span>count of Him who
established the earth upon the waters; nor was it on account of a man
that the sun grew dark in the heavens, but on account of Him who made
the great lights; nor was it for a man that the just and righteous were
restored to life again, but for Him who had granted power over death
from the beginning; nor was it for a man that the veil of the temple of
the Jews was rent from the top to the bottom, but for Him who said to
them, “Lo, your house is left desolate.”  For, lo! unless those who
crucified Him had known that He was the Son of God, they would not have
had to proclaim <span id="fr_2983"></span>[2984](#fn_2983.md) the
desolation <span id="fr_2984"></span>[2985](#fn_2984.md) of their city, nor
would they have brought down Woe! upon themselves. <span
id="fr_2985"></span>[2986](#fn_2985.md)   For, even if they had wished to
make light of this confession, <span
id="fr_2986"></span>[2987](#fn_2986.md) the fearful convulsions which took
place at that time would not have suffered them to do so.  For lo! some
even of the children of the crucifiers are become at this day preachers
and evangelists, along with my fellow-apostles, in all the land of
Palestine, and among the Samaritans, and in all the country of the
Philistines.  The idols also of paganism are despised, and the cross of
Christ is honoured, and *all* nations and creatures confess God who
became man.

<span id="ix.vi.i-p45"></span>If, therefore, while Jesus our Lord was on
earth ye would have believed in Him that He is the Son of God, and
before ye had heard the word of His preaching would have confessed Him
that He is God; now that He is ascended to His Father, and ye have seen
the signs and the wonders which are done in His name, and have heard
with your own ears the word of His Gospel, let no one of you doubt in
his mind—so that the promise of His blessing which He sent to you may be
fulfilled <span id="fr_2987"></span>[2988](#fn_2987.md) towards you: 
Blessed are ye that have believed in me, not having seen me; and,
because ye have so believed in me, the town <span
id="fr_2988"></span>[2989](#fn_2988.md) in which ye dwell shall be blessed,
and the enemy shall not prevail against it for ever. <span
id="fr_2989"></span>[2990](#fn_2989.md)   Turn not away, therefore, from
his faith:  for, lo! ye have heard and seen what things bear witness to
His faith—*showing* that He is the adorable Son, and is the glorious
God, and is the victorious King, and is the mighty Power; and through
faith in Him a man is able to acquire the eyes of a true mind, <span
id="fr_2990"></span>[2991](#fn_2990.md) and to understand that, whosoever
worshippeth creatures, the wrath of justice will overtake him.

<span id="ix.vi.i-p51"></span>For *in* everything which we speak before
you, according as we have received of the gift of our Lord, *so* speak
we and teach and declare *it*, that ye may secure <span
id="fr_2991"></span>[2992](#fn_2991.md) your salvation and not
destroy <span id="fr_2992"></span>[2993](#fn_2992.md) your spirits through
the error of paganism:  because the heavenly light has arisen on the
creation, and He it is who chose the fathers of former times, and the
righteous men, and the prophets, and spoke with them in the revelation
of the Holy Spirit. <span id="fr_2993"></span>[2994](#fn_2993.md)   For He
is Himself the God of the Jews who crucified Him; and to Him it is that
the erring pagans offer worship, even while they know it not:  because
there is no other God in heaven and on earth; and lo! confession
ascendeth up to Him from the four quarters of the creation.  Lo!
therefore, your ears have heard that which was not heard by you; and lo!
further, your eyes have seen that which was never seen by you. <span
id="fr_2994"></span>[2995](#fn_2994.md)

<span id="ix.vi.i-p56"></span>Be not, therefore, gainsayers of that
which ye have seen and heard.  Put away from you the rebellious mind of
your fathers, and free yourselves from the yoke of sin, which hath
dominion over you in libations and in sacrifices *offered* before carved
images; and be ye concerned for your endangered <span
id="fr_2995"></span>[2996](#fn_2995.md) salvation, and for the unavailing
support on which ye lean; <span id="fr_2996"></span>[2997](#fn_2996.md) and
get you a new mind, that worships the Maker and not the <span
id="page_660">p. 660</span> <span id="ix.vi.i-Page_660"></span>things
which are made—*a mind* in which is portrayed the image of verity and of
truth, of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit; believing
and being baptized in the triple and glorious names.  For this is our
teaching and our preaching.  For the belief of the truth of Christ does
not consist of many things. <span id="fr_2997"></span>[2998](#fn_2997.md)  
And those of you as are willing to be obedient to Christ are aware that
I have many times repeated my words before you, in order that ye might
learn and understand what ye hear.

<span id="ix.vi.i-p61"></span>And we ourselves shall rejoice in this,
like the husbandman who rejoices in the field which is blessed; God also
will be glorified by your repentance towards Him.  While ye are saved
hereby, we also, who give you this counsel, shall not be despoiled of
the blessed reward of this work.  And, because I am assured that ye are
a land blessed according to the will of the Lord Christ, therefore,
instead of the dust of our feet which we were commanded to shake off
against the town that would not receive our words, I have shaken off
to-day at the door of your ears the sayings of my lips, in which are
portrayed the coming of Christ which has *already* been, and also that
which is *yet* to be; and the resurrection, and the resuscitation of all
men, and the separation which is to be made between the faithful and the
unbelieving; and the sore punishment which is reserved for those who
know not God, and the blessed promise of future joy which they shall
receive who have believed in Christ and worshipped Him and His exalted
Father, and have confessed Him and His divine Spirit. <span
id="fr_2998"></span>[2999](#fn_2998.md)

<span id="ix.vi.i-p63"></span>And now it is meet for us that I conclude
my present discourse; and let those who have accepted the word of Christ
remain with us, and those also who are willing to join with us in
prayer; and afterwards let them go to their homes.

<span id="ix.vi.i-p64"></span>And Addæus the apostle was rejoiced to see
that a great number of the population of the city stayed with him; and
they were *but* few who did not remain at that time, while even those
few not many days after accepted his words and believed in the Gospel
set forth in <span id="fr_2999"></span>[3000](#fn_2999.md) the preaching of
Christ.

<span id="ix.vi.i-p66"></span>And when Addæus the apostle had spoken
these things before all the town of Edessa, and King Abgar saw that all
the city rejoiced in his teaching, men and women alike, and *heard them*
saying to him, “True and faithful is Christ who sent thee to us”—he
himself also rejoiced greatly at this, giving praise to God; because,
like as he had heard from Hanan, <span
id="fr_3000"></span>[3001](#fn_3000.md) his Tabularius, about Christ, so
had he seen the wonderful mighty-works which Addæus the apostle did in
the name of Christ.

<span id="ix.vi.i-p68"></span>And Abgar the king also said to him: 
According as I sent to Christ in my letter to Him, and according as He
also sent to me, *so* have I also received from thine own self this day;
so will I believe all the days of my life, and in the selfsame things
will I continue and make my boast, because I know also that there is no
other power in whose name these signs and wonders are done but the power
of Christ whom thou preachest in verity and in truth.  And henceforth
Him will I worship—I and my son Maanu, <span
id="fr_3001"></span>[3002](#fn_3001.md) and Augustin, <span
id="fr_3002"></span>[3003](#fn_3002.md) and Shalmath the queen.  And now,
wherever thou desirest, build a church, a place of meeting for those who
have believed and shall believe in thy words; and, according to the
command given thee by thy Lord, minister thou at the seasons with
confidence; to those also who shall be with thee as teachers of this
Gospel I am prepared to give large donations, in order that they may not
have any other work beside the ministry; and whatsoever is required by
thee for the expenses of the building I myself will give thee without
any restriction, <span id="fr_3003"></span>[3004](#fn_3003.md) whilst thy
word shall be authoritative and sovereign in this town; moreover,
without *the intervention of* any other person do thou come into my
presence as one in authority, into the palace of my royal majesty.

<span id="ix.vi.i-p72"></span>And when Abgar was gone down to his royal
palace he rejoiced, he and his princes with him, Abdu son of Abdu, and
Garmai, and Shemashgram, <span id="fr_3004"></span>[3005](#fn_3004.md) and
Abubai, and Meherdath, <span id="fr_3005"></span>[3006](#fn_3005.md)
together with the others their companions, at all that their eyes had
seen and their ears also had heard; and in the gladness of their heart
they too began to praise God for having turned their mind towards Him,
renouncing the paganism in which they had lived, <span
id="fr_3006"></span>[3007](#fn_3006.md) and confessing the Gospel of
Christ.  And when Addæus had built a church they proceeded to offer in
it vows and oblations, they and the people of the city; and there they
continued to present their praises all the days of their life.

<span id="ix.vi.i-p76"></span>And Avida and Barcalba, <span
id="fr_3007"></span>[3008](#fn_3007.md) who were chief men and rulers, and
wore the royal headband, <span id="fr_3008"></span>[3009](#fn_3008.md) drew
<span id="page_661">p. 661</span> <span
id="ix.vi.i-Page_661"></span>near to Addæus, and asked him about the
matter of Christ, *requesting* that he would tell them how He, though He
was God, appeared to them as a man:  And how, said they, were ye able to
look upon Him?  And he proceeded to satisfy them all about this, about
all that their eyes had seen and about whatsoever their ears had heard
from him.  Moreover, everything that the prophets had spoken concerning
Him he repeated before them, and they received his words gladly and with
faith, and there was not a man that withstood him; for the glorious
deeds which he did suffered not any man to withstand him.

<span id="ix.vi.i-p79"></span>Shavida, moreover, and Ebednebu, chiefs of
the priests of this town, together with Piroz <span
id="fr_3009"></span>[3010](#fn_3009.md) and Dilsu their companions, when
they had seen the signs which he did, ran and threw down the altars on
which they were accustomed to sacrifice before Nebu and Bel, <span
id="fr_3010"></span>[3011](#fn_3010.md) their gods, except the great altar
which was in the middle of the town; and they cried out and said: 
Verily this is the disciple of that eminent and glorious Master,
concerning whom we have heard all that He did in the country of
Palestine.  And all those who believed in Christ did Addæus receive, and
baptized them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
Spirit.  And those who used to worship stones and stocks sat at his
feet, recovered from the madness <span
id="fr_3011"></span>[3012](#fn_3011.md) of paganism wherewith they had been
afflicted.  Jews also, traders in fine raiment, <span
id="fr_3012"></span>[3013](#fn_3012.md) who were familiar with the law and
the prophets—they too were persuaded, and became disciples, and
confessed Christ that He is the Son of the living God.

<span id="ix.vi.i-p84"></span>But neither did King Abgar nor yet the
Apostle Addæus compel any man by force to believe in Christ, because
without the force of man the force of the signs compelled many to
believe in Him.  And with affection did they receive His doctrine—all
this country of Mesopotamia, and all the regions round about it.

<span id="ix.vi.i-p85"></span>Aggæus, moreover, who <span
id="fr_3013"></span>[3014](#fn_3013.md) made the silks <span
id="fr_3014"></span>[3015](#fn_3014.md) and headbands of the king, and
Palut, and Barshelama, and Barsamya, together with the others their
companions, clave to Addæus the apostle; and he received them, and
associated them with him in the ministry, their business being to read
in the Old Testament and the New, <span
id="fr_3015"></span>[3016](#fn_3015.md) and in the prophets, and in the
Acts of the Apostles, *and* to meditate upon them daily; strictly
charging them to let their bodies be pure and their persons holy, as is
becoming in men who stand before the altar of God.  “And be ye,” said
he, “far removed from false swearing and from wicked homicide, and from
dishonest testimony, which is connected with adultery; and from magic
arts, for which there is no mercy, and from sooth-saying, and
divination, and fortune-tellers; and from fate and nativities, of which
the deluded Chaldeans make their boast; and from the stars, and the
signs of the Zodiac, in which the foolish put their trust.  And put far
from you unjust partiality, and bribes, and presents, through which the
innocent are pronounced guilty.  And along with this ministry, to which
ye have been called, see that ye have no other work besides:  for the
Lord is the work of your ministry all the days of your life.  And be ye
diligent to give the seal of baptism.  And be not fond of the gains of
this world.  And hear ye a cause with justice and with truth.  And be ye
not a stumbling-block to the blind, lest through you should be
blasphemed the name of Him who opened *the eyes of* the blind, according
as we have seen.  Let all, therefore, who see you perceive that ye
yourselves are in harmony with whatsoever ye preach and teach.”

<span id="ix.vi.i-p89"></span>And they ministered with him in the church
which Addæus had built at the word and command of Abgar the king, being
furnished with supplies by the king and his nobles, partly for the house
of God, and partly for the supply of the poor.  Moreover, much people
day by day assembled and came to the prayers of the service, and to *the
reading of* the Old Testament, <span id="page_662">p. 662</span> <span
id="ix.vi.i-Page_662"></span>and the New of the Diatessaron. <span
id="fr_3016"></span>[3017](#fn_3016.md)   They also believed in the
restoration of the dead, and buried their departed in the hope of
resuscitation.  The festivals of the Church they also observed in their
seasons, and were assiduous every day in the vigils of the Church.  And
they made visits of almsgiving, to the sick and to those that were
whole, according to the instruction of Addæus to them.  In the environs,
too, of the city churches were built, and many received from him
ordination to the priesthood. <span id="fr_3017"></span>[3018](#fn_3017.md)
  So that even people of the East, in the guise of merchants, passed
over into the territory of the Romans, that they might see the signs
which Addæus did.  And such as became disciples received from him
ordination to the priesthood, and in their own country of the Assyrians
they instructed the people of their nation, and erected houses of prayer
there in secret, by reason of the danger from those who worshipped fire
and paid reverence to water. <span id="fr_3018"></span>[3019](#fn_3018.md)

<span id="ix.vi.i-p93"></span>Moreover, Narses, the king of the
Assyrians, when he heard of those same things which Addæus the apostle
had done, sent *a message* to Abgar the king:  Either despatch to me the
man who doeth these signs before thee, that I may see him and hear his
word, or send me *an account of* all that thou hast seen him do in thy
own town.  And Abgar wrote to Narses, <span
id="fr_3019"></span>[3020](#fn_3019.md) and related to him the whole story
of the deeds of Addæus from the beginning to the end; and he left
nothing which he did not write to him.  And, when Narses heard those
things which were written to him, he was astonished and amazed.

<span id="ix.vi.i-p95"></span>Abgar the king, moreover, because he was
not able to pass over into the territory of the Romans, <span
id="fr_3020"></span>[3021](#fn_3020.md) and go to Palestine and slay the
Jews for having crucified Christ, wrote a letter and sent it to Tiberius
Cæsar, <span id="fr_3021"></span>[3022](#fn_3021.md) writing in it thus:—

<span id="ix.vi.i-p98"></span>King Abgar to our Lord Tiberius Cæsar: 
Although I know that nothing is hidden from thy Majesty, I write to
inform thy dread and mighty Sovereignty that the Jews who are under thy
dominion and dwell in the country of Palestine have assembled themselves
together and crucified Christ, without any fault *worthy* of death,
after He had done before them signs and wonders, and had shown them
powerful mighty-works, so that He even raised the dead to life for them;
and at the time that they crucified Him the sun became darkened and the
earth also quaked, and all created things trembled and quaked, and, as
if of themselves, at this deed the whole creation and the inhabitants of
the creation shrank away.  And now thy Majesty knoweth what it is meet
for thee to command concerning the people of the Jews who have done
these things.

<span id="ix.vi.i-p99"></span>And Tiberius Cæsar wrote and sent to King
Abgar; and thus did he write to him:—

<span id="ix.vi.i-p100"></span>The letter of thy Fidelity towards me I
have received, and it hath been read before me.  Concerning what the
Jews have dared to do in the matter of the cross, Pilate <span
id="fr_3022"></span>[3023](#fn_3022.md) the governor also has written and
informed Aulbinus <span id="fr_3023"></span>[3024](#fn_3023.md) my
proconsul concerning these selfsame things of which thou hast written to
me.  But, because a war with the people of Spain, <span
id="fr_3024"></span>[3025](#fn_3024.md) who have rebelled against me, is on
foot at this time, on this account I have not been able to avenge this
matter; but I am prepared, when I shall have leisure, to issue a command
according to law against the Jews, who act not according to law.  And on
this account, as regards Pilate also, who was appointed by me governor
there—I have sent another in his stead, and dismissed him in disgrace,
because he departed from the law, <span
id="fr_3025"></span>[3026](#fn_3025.md) and did the will of the Jews, and
for the gratification of the Jews crucified Christ, who, according to
what I hear concerning Him, instead of *suffering* the cross of death,
deserved to be honoured and worshipped <span
id="fr_3026"></span>[3027](#fn_3026.md) by them:  and more especially
because with their own eyes they saw everything that He did.  Yet thou,
in accordance with thy fidelity towards me, and the faithful covenant
*entered into by* thyself and by thy fathers, hast done well in writing
to me thus.

<span id="ix.vi.i-p106"></span>And Abgar the king received Aristides,
who had been sent by Tiberius Cæsar to him; and in reply he sent him
*back* with presents of honour suitable for him who had sent him to
him.  <span id="page_663">p. 663</span> <span
id="ix.vi.i-Page_663"></span>And from Edessa he went to Thicuntha, <span
id="fr_3027"></span>[3028](#fn_3027.md) where Claudius, the second from the
emperor, was; and from thence, again, he went to Artica, <span
id="fr_3028"></span>[3029](#fn_3028.md) where Tiberius Cæsar was:  Caius,
moreover, was guarding the regions round about Cæsar.  And Aristides
himself also related before Tiberius concerning the mighty-works which
Addæus had done before Abgar the king.  And when he had leisure from the
war he sent and put to death some of the chief men of the Jews who were
in Palestine.  And, when Abgar the king heard of this, he rejoiced
greatly that the Jews had received punishment, as it was right.

<span id="ix.vi.i-p109"></span>And some years after Addæus the apostle
had built the church in Edessa, and had furnished it with everything
that was suitable for it, and had made disciples of a great number of
the population of the city, he further built churches in the
villages <span id="fr_3029"></span>[3030](#fn_3029.md) also—*both* those
which were at a distance and those which were near, and finished and
adorned them, and appointed in them deacons and elders, and instructed
in them those who should read the Scriptures, and taught the ordinances
and <span id="fr_3030"></span>[3031](#fn_3030.md) the ministry without and
within.

<span id="ix.vi.i-p112"></span>After all these things he fell ill of the
sickness of which he departed from this world.  And he called for Aggæus
before the whole assembly of the church, and bade him draw near, and
made him Guide and Ruler <span id="fr_3031"></span>[3032](#fn_3031.md) in
his stead.  And Palut, <span id="fr_3032"></span>[3033](#fn_3032.md) who
was a deacon, he made elder; and Abshelama, who was a scribe, he made
deacon.  And, the nobles and chief men being assembled, and standing
near him—Barcalba son of Zati, <span
id="fr_3033"></span>[3034](#fn_3033.md) and Maryhab <span
id="fr_3034"></span>[3035](#fn_3034.md) son of Barshemash, and Senac <span
id="fr_3035"></span>[3036](#fn_3035.md) son of Avida, and Piroz son of
Patric, <span id="fr_3036"></span>[3037](#fn_3036.md) together with the
rest of their companions—Addæus the apostle said to them:—

<span id="ix.vi.i-p119"></span>“Ye know and are witness, all of you who
hear me, that, *according to* all that I have preached to you and taught
you and ye have heard from me, even so have I behaved myself in the
midst of you, and ye have seen *it* in deeds also:  because our Lord
thus charged us, that, whatsoever we preach in words before the people,
we should practise it in deeds before all men.  And, according to the
ordinances and laws which were appointed by the disciples in
Jerusalem, <span id="fr_3037"></span>[3038](#fn_3037.md) and by which my
fellow-apostles also guided their conduct, so also *do* ye—turn not
aside from them, nor diminish aught from them: even as I also am guided
by them amongst you, and have not turned aside from them to the right
hand or to the left, lest I should become estranged from the promised
salvation which is reserved for such as are guided by them.

<span id="ix.vi.i-p121"></span>“Give <span
id="fr_3038"></span>[3039](#fn_3038.md) heed, therefore, to this ministry
which ye hold, and with fear and trembling continue in it, and minister
every day.  Minister not in it with neglectful habits, but with the
discreetness of faith; and let not the praises of Christ cease out of
your mouth, nor let weariness of prayer at the *stated* times come upon
you.  Give heed to the verity which ye hold, and to the teaching of the
truth which ye have received, and to the inheritance of salvation which
I commit to you:  because before the tribunal of Christ will ye have to
give an account of it, when He maketh reckoning with the shepherds and
overseers, and when He taketh His money from the traders with the
addition of the gains.  For He is the Son of a King, and goeth to
receive a kingdom and return; and He will come and make a resuscitation
*to life* for all men, and then will He sit upon the throne of His
righteousness, and judge the dead and the living, as He said to us.

<span id="ix.vi.i-p123"></span>“Let not the secret eye of your minds be
closed by pride, lest your stumbling-blocks be many in the way in which
there are no stumbling-blocks, but a hateful <span
id="fr_3039"></span>[3040](#fn_3039.md) wandering in its paths.  Seek ye
those that are lost, and direct those that go astray, and rejoice in
those that are found; bind up the bruised, and watch over the fatlings: 
because at your hands will the sheep of Christ be required.  Look ye not
for the honour that passeth away:  for the shepherd that looketh to
receive honour from his flock—sadly, sadly stands his flock with respect
to him.  Let your concern be great for the young lambs, whose angels
behold the face of the Father who is unseen.  And be ye not stones of
stumbling before the blind, but clearers of the way and the paths <span
id="page_664">p. 664</span> <span id="ix.vi.i-Page_664"></span>in a
rugged country, among the Jews the crucifiers, and the deluded pagans: 
for with these two parties have ye to fight, in order that ye may show
the truth of the faith which ye hold; and, though ye be silent, your
modest and decorous appearance will fight for you against those who hate
truth and love falsehood.

<span id="ix.vi.i-p125"></span>“Buffet not the poor in the presence of
the rich:  for scourge grievous enough for them is their poverty.

<span id="ix.vi.i-p126"></span>“Be not beguiled by the hateful devices
of Satan, lest ye be stripped naked of the faith which ye have put
on.” <span id="fr_3040"></span>[3041](#fn_3040.md) …“And with the Jews, the
crucifiers, we will have no fellowship.  And this inheritance which we
have received from thee we will not let go, but in that will we depart
out of this world; and on the day of our Lord, before the judgment-seat
of His righteousness, there will He restore to us this inheritance, even
as thou hast told us.”

<span id="ix.vi.i-p128"></span>And, when these things had been spoken,
Abgar the king rose up, he and his chief men and his nobles, and he went
to his palace, all of them being distressed for him because he was
dying.  And he sent to him noble and excellent apparel, that he might be
buried in it.  And, when Addæus saw it, he sent to him, *saying:*  In my
lifetime I have not taken anything from thee, nor will I now at my death
take anything from thee, nor will I frustrate the word of Christ which
He spake to us:  Accept not anything from any man, and possess not
anything in this world. <span id="fr_3041"></span>[3042](#fn_3041.md)

<span id="ix.vi.i-p130"></span>And three days more after these things
had been spoken by Addæus the apostle, and he had heard and received the
testimony concerning the teaching set forth in their preaching from
those engaged with him in the ministry, in the presence of all the
nobles he departed out of this world.  And that day was the fifth of the
week, and the fourteenth of the month Iyar, <span
id="fr_3042"></span>[3043](#fn_3042.md) *nearly answering to May*.  And the
whole city was in great mourning and bitter anguish for him.  Nor was it
the Christians only that were distressed for him, but the Jews also, and
the pagans, who were in this same town.  But Abgar the king was
distressed for him more than any one, he and the princes of his
kingdom.  And in the sadness of his soul he despised and laid aside the
magnificence of his kingly state on that day, and with tears mingled
with moans he bewailed him with all men.  And all the people of the city
that saw him were amazed *to see* how greatly he suffered on his
account.  And with great and surpassing pomp he bore *him*, and buried
him like one of the princes when he dies; and he laid him in a grand
sepulchre adorned with sculpture wrought by the fingers—that in which
were laid those of the house of Ariu, the ancestors of Abgar the king:
 there he laid him sorrowfully, with sadness and great distress.  And
all the people of the church went there from time to time and prayed
fervently; and they kept up the remembrance of his departure from year
to year, according to the command and direction which had been received
by them from Addæus the apostle, <span
id="fr_3043"></span>[3044](#fn_3043.md) and according to the word of
Aggæus, who himself became Guide and Ruler, and the successor of his
seat after him, by the ordination to the priesthood which he had
received from him in the presence of all men.

<span id="ix.vi.i-p133"></span>He too, with the same ordination which he
had received from him, made Priests and Guides in the whole of this
country of Mesopotamia.  For they also, in like manner as Addæus the
apostle, held fast his word, and listened to and received *it*, as good
and faithful successors of the apostle of the adorable Christ.  But
silver and gold he took not from any man, nor did the gifts of the
princes come near him:  for, instead of *receiving* gold and silver, he
*himself* enriched the Church of Christ with the souls of believers.

<span id="ix.vi.i-p134"></span>Moreover, *as regards* the entire
state <span id="fr_3044"></span>[3045](#fn_3044.md) of the men and the
women, they were chaste and circumspect, and holy and pure:  for they
lived like anchorites <span id="fr_3045"></span>[3046](#fn_3045.md) and
chastely, without spot—in circumspect watchfulness touching the
ministry, in their sympathy <span id="fr_3046"></span>[3047](#fn_3046.md)
toward the poor, in their visitations to the sick:  for their footsteps
were fraught with praise from those who saw *them*, and their conduct
was arrayed in commendation from strangers—so that even the priests of
the house of <span id="fr_3047"></span>[3048](#fn_3047.md) Nebu and Bel
divided the honour with them at all times, by reason of their dignified
aspect, their truthful words, their frankness of speech arising from
their noble nature, which was neither subservient through covetousness
nor in bondage under *the fear of* blame.  For there was no one who saw
them that did not run to meet them, that he might salute them
respectfully, because the very sight of them shed peace upon the
beholden:  for just like a net <span
id="fr_3048"></span>[3049](#fn_3048.md) were their words of gentleness
spread over the contumacious, and they entered within the fold of truth
and verity.  For there was no man who saw them that was <span
id="page_665">p. 665</span> <span id="ix.vi.i-Page_665"></span>ashamed
of them, because they did nothing that was not accordant with rectitude
and propriety.  And in consequence of these things their bearing was
fearless as they published their teaching to all men.  For, whatsoever
they said to others and enjoined on them, they themselves exhibited in
practice in their own persons; and the hearers, who saw that their
actions went along with their words, without much persuasion became
their disciples, and confessed the King Christ, praising God for having
turned them towards Him.

<span id="ix.vi.i-p141"></span>And some years after the death of Abgar
the king, there arose one of his contumacious <span
id="fr_3049"></span>[3050](#fn_3049.md) sons, who was not favourable to
peace; and he sent *word* to Aggæus, as he was sitting in the church: 
Make me a headband of gold, such as thou usedst to make for my fathers
in former times.  Aggæus sent to him:  I will not give up the ministry
of Christ, which was committed to me by the disciple of Christ, and make
a headband of wickedness.  And, when he saw that he did not comply, he
sent and brake his legs <span id="fr_3050"></span>[3051](#fn_3050.md) as he
was sitting in the church expounding.  And as he was dying he adjured
Palut and Abshelama:  In this house, for whose truth’s sake, lo! I am
dying, lay me and bury me.  And, even as he had adjured *them*, so did
they lay him—inside the middle door of the church, between the men and
the women.  And there was great and bitter mourning in all the church,
and in all the city—over and above the anguish and the mourning which
there had been within *the church*, such as had been the mourning when
Addæus the apostle himself died.

<span id="ix.vi.i-p144"></span>And, <span
id="fr_3051"></span>[3052](#fn_3051.md) in consequence of his dying
suddenly and quickly at the breaking of his legs, he was not able to lay
*his* hand upon Palut.  Palut went to Antioch, and received ordination
to the priesthood from Serapion bishop of Antioch; by which Serapion
himself also ordination had been received from Zephyrinus bishop of the
city of Rome, in the succession of the ordination to the priesthood from
Simon Cephas, who had received *it* from our Lord, and was bishop there
in Rome twenty-five years in the days of the Cæsar who reigned there
thirteen years.

<span id="ix.vi.i-p146"></span> ————————————

<span id="ix.vi.i-p147"></span>And, according to the custom which exists
in the kingdom of Abgar the king, and in all kingdoms, that whatsoever
the king commands and whatsoever is spoken in his presence is committed
to writing and deposited among the records, so also did Labubna, <span
id="fr_3052"></span>[3053](#fn_3052.md) son of Senac, son of Ebedshaddai,
the king’s scribe, write these things also relating to Addæus the
apostle from the beginning to the end, whilst Hanan also the Tabularius,
a sharir of the kings, set-to his hand in witness, and deposited *the
writing* among the records of the kings, where the ordinances and laws
are deposited, and where *the contracts of* the buyers and sellers are
kept with care, without any negligence whatever.

<span id="ix.vi.i-p149"></span>*Here* endeth the teaching of Addæus the
apostle, which he proclaimed in Edessa, the faithful city of Abgar, the
faithful king.

<span id="ix.vi.i-p47"></span> Perhaps “town” will not seem too
insignificant a word if it be taken in its original sense of a fortified
place, which the Syriac term also denotes.  It seemed desirable to
distinguish, if possible, the two words which have been rendered
respectively “city” and “town” in these pages.  The only exception made
is in a single passage were Rome is spoken of.—<span class="c9"><span

<span id="ix.vi.i-p48"></span> These words are not in the letter of
Christ to Abgar.  They must therefore be, either a message brought by
Addæus himself, or, much more probably, a later interpolation:  earlier,
however, than Ephraem Syrus, who alludes to them in his *Testament*. 
This notion of the immunity of the city of Edessa is referred to by
several Syriac writers.  Nor was it confined to the East:  it obtained
in very early times in our own country, where the letter of our Lord to
Abgar was regarded as a charm.  In a very ancient service-book of the
Saxon times, preserved in the British Museum, the letter followed the
Lord’s Prayer and the Apostles’ Creed; and an appended description of
the virtues of the epistle closes with these words, according to the
Latin version of Rufinus:  “*Si quis hanc epistolam secum habuerit,
securus ambulet in pace*.”  Jeremiah Jones, writing of the last century,
says:  “The common people in England have had it in their houses in many
places in a frame with a picture before it:  and they generally, with
much honesty and devotion, regard it as the word of God and the genuine
epistle of Christ.”  Even now a similar practice is believed to linger
in some districts.  The story of Abgar is told in an Anglo-Saxon poem,
published in *Abgarus-Legenden paa Old-Engelsk* by G. Stephens,
Copenhagen, 1853.

<span id="ix.vi.i-p49"></span>It consists of 204 lines, is a tolerable
close rendering of Eusebius, and is ascribed by Stephens to Aelfric,
archbishop of York from 1023 to 1052.  Note that *ambulet* (above) is

<span id="ix.vi.i-p78"></span> Or “the headbands of the kings.”  Nothing
appears to be known of the derivation of the word \*\*\*, which does not
occur in the ordinary lexicons.  Dr. Payne Smith has favoured the
translator with the following note:  “\*\*\* is evidently some kind of
ornament.  In Ephs. ii. 379 (in the form \*\*\*) it is an ornament worn
by young people.  B.A. (Bar Alii *Lex. Syro-Arab*.) and K. (Georgii
Karmsedinoyo *Lex*.) render it (in the form \*\*\*) \*\*\*, which may
mean ‘a circlet of jewels.’”  Cureton says:  “These headbands of the
king, or diadems, seem to have been made of silk or muslin scarves, like
the turbans of orientals at the present day, interwoven with gold, and
with figures and devices upon them, as was the case with that worn by
Sharbil.  See *Acts of Sharbil*, *sub init*.” The art. *Diadema* in Dr.
W. Smith’s *Antiqq*. seems to furnish a good idea of what is intended. 
The ornament was probably *white*; and this has caused our expression to
be sometimes confounded with the similar \*\*\*.  See *Teaching of Simon
Cephas*, init.—<span class="c9"><span

calls Aggæus “un fabricant de coiffures de *soie*,” according to the
translation of Florival; or “quendam *serici* opificem,” according to
Whiston.  It may be added that the word \*\*\* is doubtless the same as
our “silk,” which is only a form of *Sericum*, an adjective from

<span id="ix.vi.i-p88"></span> These terms could only have been used

the Apostles is meant the work of Luke, this passage seems to show that
the compiler of this account of Addæus wrote some years subsequently to
the events which he relates, or that it has been added by a later
interpolator.  For at the earlier period of Addæus’ ministry no other
part of the New Testament was written than the Hebrew Gospel of Matthew,
which is probably the Gospel here meant.

seems that it ought to be *Diatessaron*, which Tatian has the Syrian
compiled from the four Gospels about the middle of the second century. 
This was in general use at Edessa up to the fourth century, and Ephraem
Syrus wrote a commentary on it.  If this be so, we have here a later
interpolation.  \[The translator says (of *Ditornon* and *Diatess*.): 
“The two words would differ but slightly in the mode of writing.”  He
also corrects Cureton, who calls Tatian “the Syrian:”  it should be “the
*Assyrian*.”\]

to, in the *Exit of Mary*, *infra*:  “Sabinus, the governor who had been
appointed by the Emperor Tiberius; and even as far as the river
Euphrates the governor Sabinus had authority.”  The person meant can
only be Vitellius, who was then governor of Syria, who removed Pilate
from the administration of Judea, sending Marcellus in his stead, and
ordered him to appear before Tiberius at Rome.  The emperor died before
he reached Rome.

be intended for *Ortygia* near Syracuse, which was not far from the
island of Capreæ, where Tiberius then resided, seldom leaving it to go
farther than to the neighbouring coast of Campania.

<span id="ix.vi.i-p110"></span> Lit. “the *other* villages.”  So, in
several passages of these Documents, “the rest of the other—.”  The
habit of including two or more distinguished nations under a class to
which only one of them belongs was not unknown among classical writers
also:  as when, e.g., Thucydides speaks of the Peloponnesian war as the
most remarkable of all the wars that *preceded* it.  Milton’s imitation,
“The fairest of her daughters, Eve” \[*Paradise Lost*, iv. 324\], is
well known.—<span class="c9"><span id="ix.vi.i-p110.1"></span>Tr.</span>

<span id="ix.vi.i-p111"></span> The \*\*\* (and) seems to have been
altered into \*\*\* (of).—<span class="c9"><span
id="ix.vi.i-p111.1"></span>Wright</span>.  Perhaps “of” is the better
reading.—<span class="c9"><span id="ix.vi.i-p111.2"></span>Tr.</span>

<span id="fn_3031"></span>[663:3032](0081460.htm#fr_3031.md) <span
id="ix.vi.i-p112.1"></span>

<span id="ix.vi.i-p113"></span> It is plain from the context here, as
well as wherever it occurs in these early Syriac Documents, that this
title (or that of Guide alone) is precisely the same as that of Bishop,
although the Greek word <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.vi.i-p113.1"></span>ἐπίσκοπος</span> had not yet obtained in the
East.  The first mention we find of the title *Bishop* (in these pages)
is in the *Acts of Sharbil* about <span class="c9"><span
id="ix.vi.i-p113.2"></span>a.d.</span> 105–112, where Barsamya is called
“the Bishop of the Christians,” although he is more generally designated
as here.  It is also found in the *Teaching Simon Cephas*, *sub fin*.,
which seems to have been written early in the second century or at the
end of the first.  The passage in the *Teaching of Addæus*, p. 665,
*infra*, where it occurs, was interpolated at a much later period.

before that of Abgar, which took place <span class="c9"><span

that his ministry at Edessa lasted about ten or eleven years.

<span id="ix.vi.i-p140"></span> An allusion to [Matt. iv.

“I will make you fishers of men.”

<span id="ix.vi.i-p142"></span> i.e., refusing to accept Christianity: 
as a few lines before.—<span class="c9"><span
id="ix.vi.i-p142.1"></span>Tr.</span>  The person referred to would seem
to be the second of the two sons of Abgar called Maanu, who succeeded
his brother Maanu, and reigned fourteen years—from <span
class="c9"><span id="ix.vi.i-p142.2"></span>a.d.</span> 52 to <span

<span id="ix.vi.i-p143"></span> This ignominious mode of execution,
which was employed in the case of the two thieves at Calvary, seems to
have been of Roman origin.  The object of the king in putting Aggæus to
this kind of death was, probably, to degrade and disgrace him.

<span id="fn_3051"></span>[665:3052](0081460.htm#fr_3051.md) <span
id="ix.vi.i-p144.1"></span>

<span id="ix.vi.i-p145"></span> This paragraph is a barefaced
interpolation made by some ignorant person much later, who is also
responsible for the additions to the *Martyrdom of Sharbil*, and to that
of Barsamya.  For this Palut was made *Elder* by Addæus himself, at the
time that Aggæus was appointed *Bishop*, or *Guide and Ruler*.  This
took place even before the death of Abgar, who died <span
class="c9"><span id="ix.vi.i-p145.1"></span>a.d.</span> 45; whereas
Serapion did not become bishop of Antioch till the beginning of the
third century, if, as is here stated, he was consecrated by Zephyrinus,
who did not become Bishop of Rome till <span class="c9"><span
id="ix.vi.i-p145.2"></span>a.d.</span> 201.

<span id="fn_3052"></span>[665:3053](0081460.htm#fr_3052.md) <span
id="ix.vi.i-p147.1"></span>

<span id="ix.vi.i-p148"></span> Moses Chor., ii. 36, calls him, in the
translation of Le Vaillant de Florival, “Ghéroupna, fils de l’ecrivain
Apchatar;” in that of Whiston, “Lerubnas, Apsadari scribæ filius.” 
Apchatar of the first, and Apsadar of the second, translator are
evidently corruptions in the Armenian from the Adbshaddai (=
Ebedshaddai) of the Syriac.  Dr. Alishan, in a letter to Dr. Cureton
from the Armenian Convent of St. Lazarus, Venice, says he has found an
Armenian<span class="c9"><span id="ix.vi.i-p148.1"></span>ms.</span>, of
probably the twelfth century, which he believes to be a translation of
the present Syriac original.  It is a history of Abgad and Thaddæus,
written by Ghérubnia with the assistance of Ananias (= Hanan), confidant
(= sharir) of King Abgar.
