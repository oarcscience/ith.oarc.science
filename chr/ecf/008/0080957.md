id="vi.iv.xiv.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIII.—“To Whom Much is
Given.”</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xiv.xxiii-p2"></span>“For on thy account, O man, God
commanded the water to retire upon the face of the earth, that the earth
might be able to bring forth fruits for thee.  And He made
water-courses, that He might provide for thee fountains, and that
river-beds might be disclosed, that animals might teem forth; in a word,
that He might furnish thee with all things.  For is it not for thee that
the winds blow, and the rains fall, and the seasons change for the
production of fruits?  Moreover, it is for thee that the sun and moon,
with the other heavenly bodies, accomplish their risings and settings;
and rivers and pools, with all fountains, serve thee.  Whence to thee, O
senseless one, as the greater honour has been given, so for thee,
ungrateful, the greater punishment by fire has been prepared, because
thou wouldest not know Him whom it behoved thee before all things to
know.
