<span id="viii.iii.ii.ii"></span>

<span id="viii.iii.ii.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="viii.iii.ii.ii-p1.1"></span>I.</span>

<span id="viii.iii.ii.ii-p2"></span>On the Spoliation or Expulsion of
certain Bishops.

<span id="viii.iii.ii.ii-p3"></span>It has been reported at the seat of
the apostles by your delegates, <span
id="fr_2706"></span>[2707](#fn_2706.md) that certain of our brethren,
bishops to wit, are being expelled from their churches and seats, and
deprived of their goods, and summoned, thus destitute and spoiled, to
trial; a thing which is void of all reason, since the constitutions of
the apostles and their successors, and the statutes of emperors, and the
regulations of laws, prohibit it, and the authority of the seat of the
apostles forbids it to be done.  <span id="page_611">p. 611</span> <span
id="viii.iii.ii.ii-Page_611"></span>It has been ordained, indeed, in the
ancient statutes, that bishops who have been ejected and spoiled of
their property should recover their churches, and, in the first place,
have all their property restored to them; and then, in the second place,
that if any one may desire to accuse them justly, he should do so at the
like risk; that the judges should be discreet, the bishops right-minded
and harmonious in the Church, where they should be witnesses for every
one who seemed to be oppressed; and that they should not answer till all
that belonged to them was restored to them, and to their churches by law
without detriment.  Nor is it strange, brethren, if they persecute you,
when they persecuted even to death your Head, Christ our Lord.  Yet even
persecutions are to be endured patiently, that ye may be known to be His
disciples, for whom also ye suffer.  Whence, too, he says Himself,
“Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness’ sake.” <span
id="fr_2707"></span>[2708](#fn_2707.md)   Sustained by these testimonies,
we ought not greatly to fear the reproach of men, nor be overcome by
their up-braidings, since the Lord gives us this command by Isaiah the
prophet, saying, “Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, my
people, in whose heart is my law; fear ye not the reproach of men,
neither be ye afraid of their revilings;” <span
id="fr_2708"></span>[2709](#fn_2708.md) considering what is written in the
Psalm, “Shall not God search this out? for He knoweth the secrets of the
heart, <span id="fr_2709"></span>[2710](#fn_2709.md) and the thoughts of
such men, that they are vanity,” <span
id="fr_2710"></span>[2711](#fn_2710.md) “They spoke vanity every one with
his neighbour:  with deceitful lips in their heart, and with an evil
heart they spoke.  But the Lord shall cut off all deceitful lips, and
the tongue that speaketh proud things; who have said, Our lips are our
own; who is Lord over us?” <span id="fr_2711"></span>[2712](#fn_2711.md)  
For if they kept these things in memory, they would by no means break
forth into so great wickedness.  For they do not this by laudable and
paternal instruction (*probabili et paterna doctrina*), but that they
may wreak their vengeful feeling against the servants of God.  For it is
written, “The way of a fool is right in his eyes;” <span
id="fr_2712"></span>[2713](#fn_2712.md) and, “There are ways which seem
right unto a man, but the end thereof leads to death.” <span
id="fr_2713"></span>[2714](#fn_2713.md)   Now we who suffer these things
ought to leave them to the judgment of God, who will render to every man
according to his works; <span id="fr_2714"></span>[2715](#fn_2714.md) who
also has thundered through His servants, saying, “Vengeance is mine, I
will repay.” <span id="fr_2715"></span>[2716](#fn_2715.md)   Assist ye,
therefore, one another in good faith, and by deed and with a hearty
will; nor let any one remove his hand from the help of a brother, since
“by this,” saith the Lord, “shall all men know that ye are my disciples,
if ye have love one to another.” <span
id="fr_2716"></span>[2717](#fn_2716.md)   Whence, too, He speaks by the
prophet, saying, “Behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to
dwell together in unity!” <span id="fr_2717"></span>[2718](#fn_2717.md)  
In a spiritual dwelling, I interpret it, and in a concord which is in
God, and in the unity of the faith which distinguishes this pleasant
dwelling according to truth, which indeed was more beauteously
illustrated in Aaron and the priests <span
id="fr_2718"></span>[2719](#fn_2718.md) clothed with honour, as ointment
upon the head, nurturing the highest understanding and leading even to
the end of wisdom.  For in this dwelling the Lord has promised blessing
and eternal life.  Apprehending, therefore, the importance of this
utterance of the prophet, we have spoken this present brotherly word for
love’s sake, and by no means seeking, or meaning to seek, our own
things.  For it is not good to repay detraction with detraction, or
*according to the common proverb* to cast out a beam with a beam
(*excutere palum palo*).  Be it far from us.  Such manners are not
ours.  May the Godhead indeed forbid it.  By the just judgment of God,
power is given sometimes to sinners to persecute His saints, in order
that they who are aided and borne on by the Spirit of God may become
more glorious through the discipline of sufferings.  But to those very
persons who persecute, and reproach, and injure them, there will
doubtless be woe.  Woe, woe to those who injure the servants of God; for
injury done to them concerns Him whose service they discharge, and whose
function they execute.  But we pray that a door of enclosure be placed
upon their mouths, as we desire that no one perish or be defiled by
their lips, and that they think or publish with their mouth no hurtful
word.  Whence also the Lord speaks by the prophet, “I said I will take
heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue.” <span
id="fr_2719"></span>[2720](#fn_2719.md)   May the Lord Almighty, and His
only-begotten Son and our Saviour Jesus Christ, give you this
incitement, that with all means in your power you aid all the brethren
under whatsoever tribulations they labour, and esteem, as is meet, their
sufferings your own.  Afford them the utmost assistance by word and
deed, that ye may be found His true disciples, who enjoined all to love
the brethren as themselves.

<span id="viii.iii.ii.ii-p4"></span> By these *apocrisarii* are meant
the deputies of the bishops, and their *locum tenentes*, as it were, who
manage the affairs of the Church, hear the cases of individuals, and
refer them to the bishops.  They are therefore called *apocrisarii*,
i.e., responders, from <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.iii.ii.ii-p4.1"></span>ἀποκρίνομαι</span>, to respond.  Mention
is made of them in Justinian Novell., *Quomodo oporteat Episcopos*,
chap. xii.  Albericus understands by them the legates of the Pope.
