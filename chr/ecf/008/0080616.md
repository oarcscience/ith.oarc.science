id="vi.iv.iv.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI.—Tidings from Judæa.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.iv.vi-p2"></span>And, not to discuss such matters to you
in a long speech, while I was occupied with such reasonings and doings,
a certain report, taking its rise in the spring-time, <span
id="fr_901"></span>[902](#fn_901) in the reign of Tiberius Cæsar,
gradually grew everywhere, and ran through the world as truly the good
tidings of God, being unable to stifle the counsel of God in silence. 
Therefore it everywhere became greater and louder, saying that a certain
One in Judæa, beginning in the spring season, was preaching to the Jews
the kingdom of the invisible God, and saying that whoever of them would
reform his manner of living should enjoy it.  And in order that He might
be believed that He uttered these things full of the Godhead, He wrought
many wonderful miracles and signs by His mere command, as having
received power from God.  For He made the deaf to hear, the blind to
see, the lame to walk, raised up the bowed down, drove away every
disease, put to flight every demon; and even scabbed lepers, by only
looking on Him from a distance, were sent away cured by Him; and the
dead being brought to Him, were raised; and there was nothing which He
could not do.  And as time advanced, so much the greater, through the
arrival of more persons, and the stronger grew—I say not now the report,
but—the truth of the thing; for now at length there were meetings in
various places for consultation and inquiry as to who He might be that
had appeared, and what was His purpose.
