id="vi.iv.viii.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIV.—If a Principle Be Good,
Carry It Out.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.viii.xxiv-p2"></span>“‘But if we must emulate their
lives, let us imitate not only their adulteries, but also their
banquets.  For Kronos devoured his own children, and Zeus in like manner
his own daughter.  And what must I say?  Pelops served as a supper for
all the gods.  Wherefore let us also, before unhallowed marriages,
perpetrate a supper like that of the gods; for thus the supper would be
worthy of the marriages.  But this you would never consent to; no more
will I to adultery.  Besides this, you threaten me with the anger of
Eros as of a powerful god.  Eros is not a god, as I conceive him, but a
desire occurring from the temperament of the living creature in order to
the perpetuation of life, according to the foresight of Him who worketh
all things, that the whole race may not fail, but by reason of pleasure
another may be produced out of the substance of one who shall die,
springing forth by lawful marriage, that he may know to sustain his own
father in old age.  And this those born from adultery cannot do, not
having the nature of affection towards those who have begotten them.
