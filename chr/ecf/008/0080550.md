Scripture.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.xii.xlii-p2"></span>Then Peter, commending his
statement, said: <span id="fr_875"></span>[876](#fn_875.md)   “Ingenious
men, as I perceive, take many verisimilitudes from the things which they
read; and therefore great care is to be taken, that when the law of God
is read, it be not read according to the understanding of our own mind. 
For there are many sayings in the divine Scriptures which can be drawn
to that sense which every one has preconceived for himself; and this
ought not to be done.  For you ought not to seek a foreign and
extraneous sense, which you have brought from without, which you may
confirm from the authority of the Scriptures, but to take the sense of
truth from the Scriptures themselves; and therefore it behoves you to
learn the meaning of the Scriptures from him who keeps it according to
the truth handed down to him from his fathers, so that he can
authoritatively declare what he has rightly received.  But when one has
received an entire and firm rule of truth from the Scriptures, it will
not be improper if he contribute to the establishment of true doctrine
anything from common education and from liberal studies, which, it may
be, he has attached himself to in his boyhood; yet so that, when he has
learned the truth, he renounce falsehood and pretence.”

conclusion to the discussion.—R.\]
