<span id="vii.xiv.ix-p2"></span>And setting out to paradise, He took
hold of our forefather Adam by the hand, and delivered him, and all the
just, to the archangel Michael.  And as they were going into the door of
paradise, there met them two old men, to whom the holy fathers said: 
Who are you, who have not seen death, and have not come down into Hades,
but who dwell in paradise in your bodies and your souls?  One of them
answered, and said:  I am Enoch, who was well-pleasing to God, and who
was translated hither by Him; and this is Helias the Thesbite; and we
are also to live until the end of the world; and then we are to be sent
by God to withstand Antichrist, and to be slain by him, and after three
days to rise again, and to be snatched up in clouds to meet the
Lord. <span id="fr_1950"></span>[1951](#fn_1950.md)
