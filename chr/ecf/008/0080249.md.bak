<span id="vi.iii.v.xxxix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iii.v.xxxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLIX.—Simon’s Retreat.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.v.xxxix-p2"></span>Then the people in indignation cast
Simon from the court, and drove him forth from the gate of the house;
and only one person followed him when he was driven out. <span
id="fr_699"></span>[700](#fn_699.md)   Then silence being obtained, Peter
began to address the people in this manner:  “You ought, brethren, to
bear with wicked men patiently; knowing that although God could cut them
off, yet He suffers them to remain even till the day appointed, in which
judgment shall pass upon all.  Why then should not we bear with those
whom God suffers?  Why should not we bear with fortitude the wrongs that
they do to us, when He who is almighty does not take vengeance on them,
that both His own goodness and the impiety of the wicked may be known? 
But if the wicked one had not found Simon to be his minister, he would
doubtless have found another:  for it is of necessity that in this life
offences come, ‘but woe to that man by whom they come;’ <span
id="fr_700"></span>[701](#fn_700.md) and therefore Simon is rather to be
mourned over, because he has become a choice vessel for the wicked one,
which undoubtedly would not have happened had he not received power over
him for his former sins.  For why should I further say that he once
believed in our Jesus, and was persuaded that souls are immortal? <span
id="fr_701"></span>[702](#fn_701.md)   Although in this he is deluded by
demons, yet he has persuaded himself that he has the soul of a murdered
boy ministering to him in whatever he pleases to employ it in; in which
truly, as I have said, he is deluded by demons, and therefore I spoke to
him according to his own ideas:  for he has learned from the Jews, that
judgment and vengeance are to be brought forth against those who set
themselves against the true faith, and do not repent.  But here are men
to whom, as being perfect in crimes, the wicked one appears, that he may
deceive them, so that they may never be turned to repentance.
