id="vii.x.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XV.—How Jesus Raised a Boy to
Life.</span>

<span id="vii.x.xv-p2"></span>A few days after, a child, His neighbour,
died, and his mother mourned for him sore.  Jesus, hearing this, went
and stood over the boy, and knocked upon his breast, and said:  I say to
thee, child, do not die, but live.  And immediately the child rose up. 
And Jesus said to the boy’s mother:  Take thy son, and give him the
breast, and remember me.  And the crowd, seeing this miracle, said:  In
truth, this child is from heaven; for already has he freed many souls
from death, and he has made whole all that hope in him.

<span id="vii.x.xv-p3"></span>The scribes and Pharisees said to Mary: 
Art thou the mother of this child?  And Mary said:  Indeed I am.  And
they said to her:  Blessed art thou among women, <span
id="fr_1774"></span>[1775](#fn_1774.md) since God hath blessed the fruit of
thy womb, seeing that He hath given thee such a glorious child, and such
a gift of wisdom, as we have never seen nor heard of.  Jesus rose up and
followed His mother.  And Mary kept in her heart all the great miracles
that Jesus had done among the people, in healing many that were
diseased.  And Jesus grew in stature and wisdom; and all who saw Him
glo<span id="page_404">p. 404</span> <span
id="vii.x.xv-Page_404"></span>rified God the Father Almighty, who is
blessed for ever and ever.  Amen.

<span id="vii.x.xv-p5"></span>And all these things I Thomas the
Israelite have written what I have seen, and have recounted them to the
Gentiles and to our brethren, and many other things done by Jesus, who
was born in the land of Judah.  Behold, the house of Israel has seen
all, from the first even to the last; how great signs and wonders Jesus
did among them, which were exceedingly good, and invisible to their
father, <span id="fr_1775"></span>[1776](#fn_1775.md) as holy Scripture
relates, and the prophets have borne witness to His works in all the
peoples of Israel.  And He it is who is to judge the world according to
the will of immortality, since He is the Son of God throughout all the
world.  To Him is due all glory and honour for ever, who lives and
reigns God through all ages of ages.  Amen.

father Israel, i.e. their fathers generally, had not seen.
