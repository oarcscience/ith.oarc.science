id="vii.vi.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter 10.</span>

<span id="vii.vi.x-p2"></span>Joseph therefore came from Judæa into
Galilee, intending to marry the virgin who had been betrothed to him;
for already three months had elapsed, and it was the beginning of the
fourth since she had been betrothed to him.  In the meantime, it was
evident from her shape that she was pregnant, nor could she conceal this
from Joseph.  For in consequence of his being betrothed to her, coming
to her more freely and speaking to her more familiarly, he found out
that she was with child.  He began then to be in great doubt and
perplexity, because he did not know what was best for him to do.  For,
being a just man, he was not willing to expose her; nor, being a pious
man, to injure her fair fame by a suspicion of fornication.  He came to
the conclusion, therefore, privately to dissolve their contract, and to
send her away secretly.  And while he thought on these things, behold,
an angel of the Lord appeared to him in his sleep, saying:  Joseph, thou
son of David, fear not; that is, do not have any suspicion of
fornication in the virgin, or think any evil of her; and fear not to
take her as thy wife:  for that which is begotten in her, and which now
vexes thy soul, is the work not of man, but of the Holy Spirit.  For she
alone of all virgins shall bring forth the Son of God, and thou shalt
call His name Jesus, that is, Saviour; for He shall save His people from
their sins.  Therefore Joseph, according to the command of the angel,
took the virgin as his wife; nevertheless he knew her not, but took care
of her, and kept her in chastity. <span

conception was at hand, when Joseph, taking with him his wife along with
what things he needed, went to Bethlehem, the city from which he came. 
And it came to pass, while they were there, that her days were fulfilled
that she should bring forth; and she brought forth her first-born son,
as the holy evangelists have shown, our Lord Jesus Christ, who with the
Father and the Son <span id="fr_1705"></span>[1706](#fn_1705.md) and the
Holy Ghost lives and reigns God from everlasting to everlasting.
