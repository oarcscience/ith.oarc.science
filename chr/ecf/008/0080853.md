id="vi.iv.x.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—The Service of God’s
Appointment.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.x.viii-p2"></span>“And this is the service He has
appointed:  To worship Him only, and trust only in the Prophet of truth,
and to be baptized for the remission of sins, and thus by this pure
baptism to be born again unto God by saving water; to abstain from the
table of devils, that is, from food offered to idols, from dead
carcases, from animals which have been suffocated or caught by wild
beasts, and from blood; <span id="fr_1083"></span>[1084](#fn_1083.md) not
to live any longer impurely; to wash after intercourse; that the women
on their part should keep the law of purification; that all should be
sober-minded, given to good works, refraining from wrongdoing, looking
for eternal life from the all-powerful God, and asking with prayer and
continual supplication that they may win it.”  Such was Peter’s counsel
to the men of Sidon also.  And in few days many repented and believed,
and were healed.  And Peter having founded a church, and set over it as
bishop one of the elders who were with him, left Sidon.
