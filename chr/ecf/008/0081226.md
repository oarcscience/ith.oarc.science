<span id="vii.vi.v-p2"></span>Therefore, as the angel had commanded,
both of them setting out from the place where they were, went up to
Jerusalem; and when they had come to the place pointed out by the
angel’s prophecy, there they met each other.  Then, rejoicing at seeing
each other, and secure in the certainty of the promised offspring, they
gave the thanks due to the Lord, who exalteth the humble.  And so,
having worshipped the Lord, they returned home, and awaited in certainty
and in gladness the divine promise.  Anna therefore conceived, and
brought forth a daughter; and according to the command of the angel, her
parents called her name Mary.
