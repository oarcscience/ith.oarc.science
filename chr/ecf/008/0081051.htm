<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xviii.xi-p2"></A>And Peter said:&#160; &#8220;Since, then, you are eager henceforth to learn what relates to our religion, I ought to explain it in order, beginning with God Himself, and showing that we ought to call Him alone God, and that we neither ought to speak of the others as gods nor deem them such, and that he who acts contrary to this will be punished eternally, as having shown the greatest impiety to Him who is the Lord of all.&#8221;&#160; And saying this, he laid his hands on those who were vexed by afflictions, and were diseased, and possessed by demons; and, praying, he healed them, and dismissed the multitudes.&#160; And then entering in this way, he partook of his usual food, and went to sleep.</p>
