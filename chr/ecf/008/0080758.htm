<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.vi.lxxi-p2"></A>&#8220;But, brethren, there are some things that you must not wait to hear, but must consider of yourselves what is reasonable.&#160; Zacch&aelig;us alone having given himself up wholly to labour for you, and needing sustenance, and not being able to attend to his own affairs, how can he procure necessary support?&#160; Is it not reasonable that you are to take forethought for his living? not waiting for his asking you, for this is the part of a beggar.&#160; But he will rather die of hunger than submit to do this.&#160; And shall not you incur punishment, not considering that the workman is worthy of his hire?&#160; And let no one say:&#160; Is, then, the word sold which was freely given?&#160; Far be it.&#160; For if any one has the means of living, and takes anything, he sells the word; but if he who has not takes support in order to live&#8212;as the Lord also took at supper and among His friends, having nothing, though He alone is the owner of all things&#8212;he sins not.&#160; Therefore suitably honour elders, catechists, useful deacons, widows who have lived well, orphans as children of the Church.&#160; But wherever there is need of any provision for an emergency, contribute all together.&#160; Be kind one to another, not shrinking from the endurance of anything whatever for your own salvation.&#8221;</p>
