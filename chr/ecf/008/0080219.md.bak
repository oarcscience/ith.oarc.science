<span id="vi.iii.v.ix-p2"></span>Then Simon said:  “Does it not seem to
you to be absurd that an unskilled people should sit in judgment upon
our sayings?”  Then Peter:  “It is not so; for what perhaps is less
clear to one, can be investigated by many, for oftentimes even a popular
rumour has the aspect of a prophecy.  But in addition to all this, all
these people stand here constrained by the love of God, and by a desire
to know the truth, and therefore all these are to be regarded as one, by
reason of their affection being one and the same towards the truth; as,
on the other hand, two are many and diverse, if they disagree with each
other.  But if you wish to receive an indication how all these people
who stand before us are as one man, consider from their very silence and
quietness how with all patience, as you see, they do honour to the truth
of God, even before they learn it, for they have not yet learned the
greater observance which they owe to it.  Wherefore I hope, through the
mercy of God, that He will accept the religious purpose of their mind
towards Him, and will give the palm of victory to him who preaches the
truth, that He may make manifest to them the herald of truth.”
