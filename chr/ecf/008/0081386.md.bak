<span id="vii.xliv-p2"></span><span class="c29"><span
id="vii.xliv-p2.1"></span>Here Beginneth the Passing</span> <span
class="c29"><span id="vii.xliv-p2.2"></span>of the Blessed Virgin
Mary.</span>

<span id="vii.xliv-p3"></span>1. <span
id="fr_2657"></span>[2658](#fn_2657.md)   <span class="c9"><span
id="vii.xliv-p4.2"></span>Therefore</span>, when the Lord and Saviour
Jesus Christ was hanging on the tree fastened by the nails of the cross
for the life of the whole world, He saw about the cross His mother
standing, and John the evangelist, whom He peculiarly loved above the
rest of the apostles, because he alone of them was a virgin in the
body.  He gave him, therefore, the charge of holy Mary, saying to him: 
Behold thy mother! and saying, to her:  Behold thy son! <span
id="fr_2658"></span>[2659](#fn_2658.md)   From that hour the holy mother of
God remained specially in the care of John, as long as she had her
habitation in this life.  And when the apostles had divided the world by
lot for preaching, she settled in the house of his parents near Mount
Olivet.

<span id="vii.xliv-p6"></span>2.  In the second year, therefore, after
Christ had vanquished death, and ascended up into heaven, on a certain
day, Mary, burning with a longing for Christ, began to weep alone,
within the shelter of her abode.  And, behold, an angel, shining in a
dress of great light, stood before her and gave utterance to <span
id="fr_2659"></span>[2660](#fn_2659.md) the words of salutation saying: 
Hail! thou blessed by the Lord, receive the salutation of Him who
commanded safety to Jacob by His prophets.  Behold, said He, a palm
branch—I have brought it to thee from the paradise of the Lord—which
thou wilt cause to be carried before thy bier, when on the third day
thou shalt be taken up from the body.  For, lo, thy Son awaits thee with
thrones and angels, and all the powers of heaven.  Then Mary said to the
angel:  I beg that all the apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ be
assembled to me.  To whom the angel said:  Behold, to-day, by the power
of my Lord Jesus Christ, all the apostles will come to thee.  And Mary
says to him:  I ask that thou send upon me thy blessing, that no power
of the lower world may withstand me in that hour in which my soul shall
go out of my body, and that I may not see the prince of darkness.  And
the angel said:  No power indeed of the lower world will hurt thee; and
thy Lord God, whose servant and messenger I am, hath given thee eternal
blessing; but do not think that the privilege of not seeing the prince
of darkness is to be given thee by me, but by Him whom thou hast carried
in thy womb; for to Him belongeth power over all for ever and ever. 
Thus saying, the angel departed with great splendour.  And that palm
shone with exceeding great light.  Then Mary, undressing herself, put on
better garments.  And, taking the palm which she had received from the
hands of the angel, she went out to the mount of Olivet, and began to
pray, and say:  I had not been worthy, O Lord, to bear Thee, unless Thou
hadst had compassion on me; but nevertheless I have kept the treasure
which Thou entrustedst to me.  Therefore I ask of Thee, O King of glory,
that the power of Gehenna hurt me not.  For if the heavens and the
angels daily tremble before Thee, how much more man who is made from the
ground, who possesses no good thing, except as much as he has received
from Thy benignant bounty!  Thou art, O Lord, God always blessed for
ever.  And thus saying, she went back to her dwelling.

<span id="vii.xliv-p8"></span>3.  And, behold, suddenly, while St. John
was preaching in Ephesus, on the Lord’s day, at the third hour of the
day, there was a great earthquake, and a cloud raised him and took him
up from the eyes of all, and brought him before the door of the house
where Mary was.  And knocking at the door, he immediately went in.  And
when Mary saw him, she exulted in joy, and said:  I beg of thee, my son
John, be mindful of the words of my Lord Jesus Christ, in which He
entrusted me to thee.  For, behold, on the third day, when I am to
depart from the body, <span id="fr_2660"></span>[2661](#fn_2660.md) I have
heard the plans of the Jews, saying, Let us wait for the day when she
who bore that seducer shall die, and let us burn her body with fire. 
She therefore called St. John, and led him into the secret chamber of
the house, and showed him the robe of her burial, and that palm of light
which she had received from the <span id="page_596">p. 596</span> <span
id="vii.xliv-Page_596"></span>angel, instructing him that he should
cause it to be carried before her couch when she was going to her tomb.

<span id="vii.xliv-p10"></span>4.  And St. John said to her:  How shall
I alone perform thy funeral rites, unless my brethren and
fellow-apostles of my Lord Jesus Christ come to pay honour to thy body? 
And, behold, on a sudden, by the command of God, all the apostles were
snatched up, raised on a cloud, from the places in which they were
preaching the word of God, and set down before the door of the house in
which Mary dwelt.  And, saluting each other, they wondered, saying: 
What is the cause for which the Lord hath assembled us here? <span
id="fr_2661"></span>[2662](#fn_2661.md)

<span id="vii.xliv-p12"></span>5.  Then all the apostles,
rejoicing <span id="fr_2662"></span>[2663](#fn_2662.md) with one mind,
finished their prayer.  And when they had said the Amen, behold, on a
sudden, there came the blessed John, and told them all these things. 
The apostles then, having entered the house, found Mary, and saluted
her, saying:  Blessed art thou by the Lord, who hath made heaven and
earth.  And she said to them:  Peace be with you, most beloved
brethren!  How have you come hither?  And they recounted to her how they
had come, each one raised on a cloud by the Spirit of God, and set down
in the same place.  And she said to them:  God hath not deprived me of
the sight of you.  Behold, I shall go the way of all the earth, and I
doubt not that the Lord hath now conducted you hither to bring me
consolation for the anguish which is just coming upon me.  Now therefore
I implore you, that without intermission you all with one mind watch,
even till that hour in which the Lord will come, and I shall depart from
the body.

<span id="vii.xliv-p14"></span>6.  And when they had sat down in a
circle consoling her, when they had spent three days in the praises of
God, behold, on the third day, about the third hour of the day, a deep
sleep seized upon all who were in that house, and no one was at all able
to keep awake but the apostles alone, and only the three virgins who
were there.  And, behold, suddenly the Lord Jesus Christ came with a
great multitude of angels; and a great brightness came down upon that
place, and the angels were singing a hymn, and praising God together. 
Then the Saviour spoke, saying:  Come, most precious pearl, within the
receptacle of life eternal.

<span id="vii.xliv-p15"></span>7.  Then Mary prostrated herself on the
pavement, adoring God, and said:  Blessed be the name of Thy glory, O
Lord my God, who hast deigned to choose me Thine handmaid, and to
entrust to me Thy hidden mystery.  Be mindful of me, therefore, O King
of glory, for Thou knowest that I have loved Thee with all my heart, and
kept the treasure committed to me.  Therefore receive me, Thy servant,
and free me from the power of darkness, that no onset of Satan may
oppose me, and that I may not see filthy spirits standing in my way. 
And the Saviour answered her:  When I, sent by my Father for the
salvation of the world, was hanging on the cross, the prince of darkness
came to me; but when he was able to find in me no trace of his
work, <span id="fr_2663"></span>[2664](#fn_2663.md) he went off vanquished
and trodden under foot.  But when thou shalt see him, thou shalt see him
indeed by the law of the human race, in accordance with which thou hast
come to the end of thy life; but he cannot hurt thee, because I am with
thee to help thee.  Go in security, because the heavenly host is waiting
for thee to lead thee in to the joys of paradise.  And when the Lord had
thus spoken, Mary, rising from the pavement, reclined upon her couch,
and giving thanks to God, gave up the ghost.  And the apostles saw that
her soul was of such whiteness, that no tongue of mortals can worthily
utter it; for it surpassed all the whiteness of snow, and of every
metal, and of gleaming silver, by the great brightness of its light.

<span id="vii.xliv-p17"></span>8.  Then the Saviour spoke, saying: 
Rise, Peter, and take the body of Mary, and send it to the right hand
side of the city towards the east, and thou wilt find there a new tomb,
in which you will lay her, and wait until I come to you.  And thus
saying, the Lord delivered the soul of St. Mary to Michael, who was the
ruler of paradise, and the prince of the nation of the Jews; <span
id="fr_2664"></span>[2665](#fn_2664.md) and Gabriel went with them.  And
immediately the Saviour was received up into heaven along with the
angels.

<span id="vii.xliv-p19"></span>9.  And the three virgins, who were in
the same place, and were watching, took up the body of the blessed Mary,
that they might wash it after the manner of funeral rites.  And when
they had taken off her clothes, that sacred body shone with so much
brightness, that it could be touched indeed for preparation for burial,
but the form of it could not be seen for the excessive flashing light: 
except that the splendour of the Lord appeared great, and nothing was
perceived, the body, when it was washed, was perfectly clean, and
stained by no moisture of filth. <span
id="fr_2665"></span>[2666](#fn_2665.md)   And when they had put the
dead-clothes on her, that light <span id="page_597">p. 597</span> <span
id="vii.xliv-Page_597"></span>was gradually obscured.  And the body of
the blessed Mary was like lily flowers; and an odour of great sweetness
came forth from it, so that no sweetness could be found like it.

<span id="vii.xliv-p21"></span>10.  Then, accordingly, the apostles laid
the holy body on the bier, and said to each other:  Who is to carry this
palm before her bier?  Then John said to Peter:  Thou, who hast
precedence of us in the apostleship, shouldst carry this palm before her
couch.  And Peter answered him:  Thou wast the only virgin among us
chosen by the Lord, and thou didst find so great favour that thou didst
recline upon His breast. <span id="fr_2666"></span>[2667](#fn_2666.md)  
And He, when for our salvation He was hanging upon the stem of the
cross, entrusted her to thee with His own mouth.  Thou therefore
oughtest to carry this palm, and let us take up that body to carry it
even to the place of sepulture. <span
id="fr_2667"></span>[2668](#fn_2667.md)   After this, Peter, raising *it,
and saying*, Take the body, began to sing and say:  Israel hath gone
forth out of Egypt.  Alleluiah.  And the other apostles along with him
carried the body of the blessed Mary, and John bore the palm of light
before the bier.  And the other apostles sang with a most sweet voice.

<span id="vii.xliv-p24"></span>11.  And, behold, a new miracle.  There
appeared above the bier a cloud exceeding great, like the great circle
which is wont to appear beside the splendour of the moon; and there was
in the clouds an army of angels sending forth a sweet song, <span
id="fr_2668"></span>[2669](#fn_2668.md) and from the sound of the great
sweetness the earth resounded.  Then the people, having gone forth from
the city, about fifteen thousand, wondered, saying:  What is that sound
of so great sweetness?  Then there stood up one who said to them:  Mary
has departed from the body, and the disciples of Jesus are singing <span
id="fr_2669"></span>[2670](#fn_2669.md) praises around her.  And looking,
they saw the couch crowned with great glory, and the apostles singing
with a loud voice.  And, behold, one of them, who was chief of the
priests of the Jews in his rank, filled with fury and rage, said to the
rest:  Behold, the tabernacle of him who disturbed us and all our race,
what glory has it received?  And going up, he wished to overturn the
bier, and throw the body down to the ground.  And immediately his hands
dried up from his elbows, and stuck to the couch.  And when the apostles
raised the bier, part of him hung, and part of him adhered to the couch;
and he was vehemently tormented with pain, while the apostles were
walking and singing.  And the angels who were in the clouds smote the
people with blindness.

<span id="vii.xliv-p27"></span>12.  Then that chief cried out, saying: 
I implore thee, Saint Peter, do not despise me, I beseech thee, in so
great an extremity, because I am exceedingly tortured by great
torments.  Bear in mind that when, in the prætorium, the maid that kept
the door <span id="fr_2670"></span>[2671](#fn_2670.md) recognised thee, and
told the others to revile thee, then I spoke good words in thy behalf. 
Then Peter answering, said:  It is not for me to give other to thee; but
if thou believest with thy whole heart on the Lord Jesus Christ, whom
she carried in her womb, and remained a virgin after the birth, the
compassion of the Lord, which with profuse benignity saves <span
id="fr_2671"></span>[2672](#fn_2671.md) the unworthy, will give thee
salvation. <span id="fr_2672"></span>[2673](#fn_2672.md)

<span id="vii.xliv-p31"></span>To this he replied:  Do we not believe? 
But what shall we do?  The enemy of the human race has blinded our
hearts, and confusion has covered our face, lest we should confess the
great things of God, especially when we ourselves uttered maledictions
against Christ, shouting:  His blood be upon us, and upon our
children. <span id="fr_2673"></span>[2674](#fn_2673.md)   Then Peter said: 
Behold, this malediction will hurt him who has remained unfaithful to
Him; but to those who turn themselves to God mercy is not denied.  And
he said:  I believe all that thou sayest to me; only I implore, have
mercy upon me, lest I die.

<span id="vii.xliv-p33"></span>13.  Then Peter made the couch stand
still, and said to him:  If thou believest with all thy heart upon the
Lord Jesus Christ, thy hands will be released from the bier.  And when
he had said this <span id="fr_2674"></span>[2675](#fn_2674.md) his hands
were immediately released from the bier, and he began to stand on his
feet; but his arms were dried up, and the torture did not go away from
him.  Then Peter said to him:  Go up to the body, and kiss the couch,
and say:  I believe in God, and in the Son of God, Jesus Christ, whom
she bore, and I believe all whatsoever Peter the apostle of God has said
to me.  And going up, he kissed the couch, and immediately all pain went
away from him, and his hands were healed.  Then he began greatly to
bless God, and from the books of Moses to render testimony to the
praises of Christ, so that even the apostles themselves wondered, and
wept for joy, praising the name of the Lord.

<span id="vii.xliv-p35"></span>14.  And Peter said to him:  Take this
palm from the hand of our brother John, and going into the city thou
wilt find much people blinded, and declare to them the great things of
God; and whosoever shall believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, thou shalt
put this palm upon their eyes, and they shall see; but those who will
not believe shall remain blind.  And when he had done so, he found much
people blinded, lamenting thus:  Woe unto us, because we have been made
like <span id="page_598">p. 598</span> <span
id="vii.xliv-Page_598"></span>the Sodomites struck with blindness. <span
id="fr_2675"></span>[2676](#fn_2675.md)   Nothing now is left to us but to
perish.  But when they heard the words of the chief who had been cured
speaking, they believed in the Lord Jesus Christ; and when he put the
palm over their eyes, they recovered sight.  Five of them remaining in
hardness of heart died.  And the chief of the priests going forth,
carried back the palm to the apostles, reporting all things whatsoever
had been done.

<span id="vii.xliv-p37"></span>15.  And the apostles, carrying Mary,
came to the place of the Valley of Jehoshaphat which the Lord had showed
them; and they laid her in a new tomb, and closed the sepulchre.  And
they themselves sat down at the door of the tomb, as the Lord had
commanded them; and, behold, suddenly the Lord Jesus Christ came with a
great multitude of angels, with a halo of great brightness gleaming, and
said to the apostles:  Peace be with you!  And they answered and said: 
Let Thy mercy, O Lord, be upon us, as we have hoped in Thee. <span
id="fr_2676"></span>[2677](#fn_2676.md)   Then the Saviour spoke to them,
saying:  Before I ascended to my Father I promised to you, saying that
you who have followed me in the regeneration, when the Son of man shall
sit upon the throne of His majesty, will sit, you also, upon twelve
thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. <span
id="fr_2677"></span>[2678](#fn_2677.md)   Her, therefore, did I choose out
of the tribes of Israel by the command of my Father, that I should dwell
in her.  What, therefore, do you wish that I should do to her?  Then
Peter and the other apostles said:  Lord, Thou didst choose beforehand
this Thine handmaid to become a spotless chamber for Thyself, and us Thy
servants to minister unto Thee.  Before the ages Thou didst foreknow all
things along with the Father, with whom to Thee and the Holy Spirit
there is one Godhead, equal and infinite power.  If, therefore, it were
possible to be done in the presence of the power of Thy grace, it had
seemed to us Thy servants to be right that, just as Thou, having
vanquished death, reignest in glory, so, raising up again the body of
Thy mother, Thou shouldst take her with Thee in joy into heaven.

<span id="vii.xliv-p40"></span>16.  Then the Saviour said:  Let it be
according to your opinion.  And He ordered the archangel Michael to
bring the soul of St. Mary.  And, behold, the archangel Michael <span
id="fr_2678"></span>[2679](#fn_2678.md) rolled back the stone from the door
of the tomb; and the Lord said:  Arise, my beloved and my nearest
*relation;* thou who hast not put on corruption by intercourse with man,
suffer not destruction of the body in the sepulchre.  And immediately
Mary rose from the tomb, and blessed the Lord, and falling forward at
the feet of the Lord, adored Him, saying:  I cannot render sufficient
thanks to Thee, O Lord, for Thy boundless benefits which Thou hast
deigned to bestow upon me Thine handmaiden.  May Thy name, O Redeemer of
the world, God of Israel, be blessed for ever.

<span id="vii.xliv-p42"></span>17.  And kissing her, the Lord went back,
and delivered her soul to the angels, that they should carry it into
paradise.  And He said to the apostles:  Come up to me.  And when they
had come up He kissed them, and said:  Peace be to you! as I have always
been with you, so will I be even to the end of the world.  And
immediately, when the Lord had said this, He was lifted up on a cloud,
and taken back into heaven, and the angels along with Him, carrying the
blessed Mary into the paradise of God.  And the apostles being taken up
in the clouds, returned each into the place allotted <span
id="fr_2679"></span>[2680](#fn_2679.md) for his preaching, telling the
great things of God, and praising our Lord Jesus Christ, who liveth and
reigneth with the Father and the Holy Spirit, in perfect unity, and in
one substance of Godhead, for ever and ever.  Amen.

<span id="vii.xliv-p4"></span> The other<span class="c9"><span
id="vii.xliv-p4.1"></span>ms.</span> has the following introductory
chapter:  Melito, servant of Christ, bishop of the church of Sardis, to
the venerable brethren in the Lord appointed at Laodicea, in peace
greeting.  I remember that I have often written of one Leucius, who,
having along with ourselves associated with the apostles, turned aside
through alienated feelings and a rash soul from the path of rectitude,
and inserted very many things in his books about the acts of the
apostles.  Of their powers, indeed, he said many and diverse things; but
of their teaching he gave a very false account, affirming that they
taught otherwise than they did, and establishing his own impious
statements, as it were, by their words.  Nor did he think this to be
enough; but he even vitiated, by his impious writing, the assumption of
the blessed ever-virgin Mary, the mother of God, to such a degree that
it would be impious not only to read it in the church of God, but even
to hear it.  When you ask us, therefore, what we heard from the Apostle
John, we simply write this, and have directed it to your brotherhood;
believing, not the strange dogmas hatched by heretics, but the Father in
the Son, the Son in the Father, while the threefold person of the
Godhead and undivided substance remains; *believing* not that two human
natures were created by a good God, which by the craft of the serpent
was vitiated through sin, and restored through the grace of Christ.
