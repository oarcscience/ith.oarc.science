<span id="v.iii.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iii.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter III.—True Virgins Prove Themselves
Such by Self-Denial, as Does the True Believer by Good Works.</span>

<span id="v.iii.iii-p2"></span>For virgins are a beautiful pattern to
believers, and to those who shall believe.  The name alone, indeed,
without works, does not introduce into the kingdom of heaven; but, if a
man be truly a believer, such an one can be saved.  For, if a person be
only called a believer in name, whilst he is not such in works, he
cannot possibly be a believer.  “Let no one,” therefore, “lead you
astray with the empty words of error.” <span
id="fr_304"></span>[305](#fn_304.md)   For, merely because a person is
called a virgin, if he be destitute of works excellent and comely, and
suitable to virginity, he cannot possibly be saved.  For our Lord called
such virginity as that “foolish,” as He said in the Gospel; <span
id="fr_305"></span>[306](#fn_305.md) and because it had neither oil nor
light, it was left outside of the kingdom of heaven, and was shut out
from the joy of the bridegroom, and was reckoned with His enemies.  For
such persons as these “have the appearance only of the fear of God, but
the power of it they deny.” <span id="fr_306"></span>[307](#fn_306.md)  
For they “think with themselves that they are something, whilst they are
nothing, and are deceived.  But let every one constantly try <span
id="fr_307"></span>[308](#fn_307.md) his works,” <span
id="fr_308"></span>[309](#fn_308.md) and know himself; for empty worship
does he offer, whosoever he be that makes profession of virginity and
<span id="page_56">p. 56</span> <span
id="v.iii.iii-Page_56"></span>sanctity, “and denies its power.”  For
virginity of such a kind is impure, and disowned by all good works.  For
“every tree whatsoever is known from its fruits.” <span
id="fr_309"></span>[310](#fn_309.md)   “See that thou understand <span
id="fr_310"></span>[311](#fn_310.md) what I say:  God will give thee
understanding.” <span id="fr_311"></span>[312](#fn_311.md)   For whosoever
engages before God to preserve sanctity must be girded with all the holy
power of God.  And, if with true fear <span
id="fr_312"></span>[313](#fn_312.md) he crucify his body, he for the sake
of the fear of God excuses himself from that word *in* which *the
Scripture* <span id="fr_313"></span>[314](#fn_313.md) has said:  “Be
fruitful, and multiply,” <span id="fr_314"></span>[315](#fn_314.md) and
*shuns* all the display, and care, and sensuality, <span
id="fr_315"></span>[316](#fn_315.md) and fascination of this world, and its
revelries and its drunkenness, and all its luxury and ease, and
withdraws from the entire life of <span
id="fr_316"></span>[317](#fn_316.md) this world, and from its snares, and
nets, and hindrances; and, whilst thou walkest <span
id="fr_317"></span>[318](#fn_317.md) upon the earth, be zealous that thy
work and thy business be in heaven.
