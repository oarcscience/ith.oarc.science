<span id="vii.xiii.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vii.xiii.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 14.</span>

<span id="vii.xiii.xv-p2"></span>And a few days after there came from
Galilee to Jerusalem three men.  One of them was a priest, by name
Phinees; the second a Levite, by name Aggai; and the third a soldier, by
name Adas.  These came to the chief priests, and said to them and to the
people:  Jesus, whom you crucified, we have seen in Galilee with his
eleven disciples upon the Mount of Olives, teaching them, and saying, Go
into all the world, and proclaim the good news; and whosoever will
believe and be baptized shall be saved; but whosoever will not believe
shall be condemned.  And having thus spoken, he went up into
heaven. <span id="fr_1922"></span>[1923](#fn_1922.md)   And both we and
many others of the five hundred <span
id="fr_1923"></span>[1924](#fn_1923.md) besides were looking on.

<span id="vii.xiii.xv-p5"></span>And when the chief priests and the Jews
heard these things, they said to these three:  Give glory <span
id="page_433">p. 433</span> <span id="vii.xiii.xv-Page_433"></span>to
the God of Israel, and repent of these lies that you have told.  They
answered:  As the God of our fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob liveth,
we do not lie, but tell you the truth.  Then the high priest spoke, and
they brought the old *covenant* of the Hebrews out of the temple, and he
made them swear, and giving them also money, he sent them into another
place, in order that they might not proclaim in Jerusalem the
resurrection of Christ.

<span id="vii.xiii.xv-p6"></span>And when these stories had been heard
by all the people, the crowd came together into the temple, and there
was a great commotion.  For many said:  Jesus has risen from the dead,
as we hear, and why did you crucify him?  And Annas and Caiaphas said: 
Do not believe, ye Jews, what the soldiers say; and do not believe that
they saw an angel coming down from heaven.  For we have given money to
the soldiers, in order that they should not tell such tales to any one;
and thus also have the disciples of Jesus given them money, in order
that they should say that Jesus has risen from the dead.
