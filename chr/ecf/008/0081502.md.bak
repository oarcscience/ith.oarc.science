<span id="x.v.v-p4"></span>We have collected together *extracts* from
the Law and the Prophets relating to those things which have been
declared concerning our Lord Jesus Christ, that we may prove to your
love that this *Being* is perfect reason, the Word of God; He who was
begotten before the light; He who is Creator together with the Father;
He who is the Fashioner of man; He who is all in all; He who among the
patriarchs is Patriarch; He who in the law is the Law; among the <span
id="page_757">p. 757</span> <span id="x.v.v-Page_757"></span>priests,
Chief Priest; among kings, the Ruler; among prophets, the Prophet; among
the angels, Archangel; in the voice *of the preacher*, the Word; among
spirits, the Spirit; in the Father, the Son; in God, God; King for ever
and ever.  For this is He who was pilot to Noah; He who was guide to
Abraham; He who was bound with Isaac; He who was in exile with Jacob; He
who was sold with Joseph; He who was captain of the host with Moses; He
who was the divider of the inheritance with Jesus the son of Nun; He who
in David and the prophets announced His own sufferings; He who put on a
bodily form in the Virgin; He who was born in Bethlehem; He who was
wrapped in swaddling-clothes in the manger; He who was seen by the
shepherds; He who was glorified by the angels; He who was worshipped by
the Magi; He who was pointed out by John; He who gathered together the
apostles; He who preached the kingdom; He who cured the lame; He who
gave light to the blind; He who raised the dead; He who appeared in the
temple; He who was not believed on by the people; He who was betrayed by
Judas; He who was apprehended by the priests; He who was condemned by
Pilate; He who was pierced in the flesh; He who was hanged on the tree;
He who was buried in the earth; He who rose from the place of the dead;
He who appeared to the apostles; He who was carried up to heaven; He who
is seated at the right hand of the Father; He who is the repose of those
that are departed; the recoverer of those that are lost; the light of
those that are in darkness; the deliverer of those that are captive; the
guide of those that go astray; the asylum of the afflicted; the
bridegroom of the Church; the charioteer of the cherubim; the captain of
the angels; God who is from God; the Son who is from the Father; Jesus
Christ the King for evermore.  Amen.
