id="vi.iv.vi.xlii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLII.—Was Adam Blind?</span>

<span id="vi.iv.vi.xlii-p2"></span>Then said Peter:  “Because things are
written opposite to those sayings which speak evil of him; wherefore
neither the one nor the other can be confirmed.”  Then Simon:  “How,
then, is the truth to be ascertained, of those Scriptures that say he is
evil, or of those that say he is good?”  Then Peter:  “Whatever sayings
of the Scriptures are in harmony with the creation that was made by Him
are true, but whatever are contrary to it are false.” <span
id="fr_985"></span>[986](#fn_985.md)   Then Simon said:  “How can you show
that the Scriptures contradict themselves?”  And Peter said:  “You say
that Adam was created blind, which was not so; for He would not have
pointed out the tree of the knowledge of good and evil to a blind man,
and commanded him not to taste of it.”  Then said Simon:  “He meant that
his mind was blind.”  Then Peter:  “How could he be blind in respect of
his mind, who, before tasting of the tree, in harmony with Him who made
him, imposed appropriate names on all the animals?”  Then Simon:  “If
Adam had foreknowledge, how did he not foreknow that the serpent would
deceive his wife?”  Then Peter:  “If Adam had not foreknowledge, how did
he give names to the sons of men as they were born with reference to
their future doings, calling the first Cain (which is interpreted
‘envy’), who through envy killed his brother Abel (which is interpreted
‘grief’), for his parents grieved over him, the first slain?
