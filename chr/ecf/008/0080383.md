Continued.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.ix.xvi-p2"></span>“Now in order to carry out this plan,
I pretended that I had had a dream, in which some deity stood by me in a
vision, and told me that I should immediately depart from the city with
my twins, and should be absent until he should command me to return; and
that, if I did not do so, I should perish with all my children.  And so
it was done.  For as soon as I told the dream to my husband, he was
terrified; and sending with me my twin sons, and also slaves and
maid-servants, and giving me plenty of money, he ordered me to sail to
Athens, where I might educate my sons, and that I should stay there
until he who commanded me to depart should give me leave to return. 
While I was sailing along with my sons, I was shipwrecked in the night
by the violence of the winds, and, wretch that I am, was driven to this
place; and when all had perished, a powerful wave caught me, and cast me
upon a rock.  And while I sat there with this only hope, that haply I
might be able to find my sons, I did not throw myself into the deep,
although then my soul, disturbed and drunk with grief, had both the
courage and the power to do it.
