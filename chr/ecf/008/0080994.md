Hospitality.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xv.xxiii-p2"></span>But Peter said, “Alas!  What are you
doing, my son Clement, shaking off your real mother?”  But I, when I
heard this, wept, and falling down by my mother, who had fallen, I
kissed her.  For as soon as this was told me, I in some way recalled her
appearance indistinctly.  Then great crowds ran together to see the
beggar woman, telling one another that her son had recognised her, and
that he was a man of consideration.  Then, when we would have
straightway left the island with my mother, she said to us, “My much
longed-for son, it is right that I should bid farewell to the woman who
entertained me, <span id="page_297">p. 297</span> <span
id="vi.iv.xv.xxiii-Page_297"></span>who, being poor and wholly
debilitated, lies in the house.”  And Peter hearing this, and all the
multitude who stood by, admired the good disposition of the woman.  And
immediately Peter ordered some persons to go and bring the woman on her
couch.  And as soon as the couch was brought and set down, Peter said,
in the hearing of the whole multitude, “If I be a herald of the truth,
in order to the faith of the bystanders, that they may know that there
is one God, who made the world, let her straightway rise whole.”  And
while Peter was still speaking, the woman arose healed, and fell down
before Peter, and kissed her dear associate, and asked her what it all
meant.  Then she briefly detailed to her the whole business of the
recognition, <span id="fr_1146"></span>[1147](#fn_1146.md) to the
astonishment of the hearers.  Then also my mother, seeing her hostess
cured, entreated that she herself also might obtain healing.  And his
placing his hand upon her, cured her also.
