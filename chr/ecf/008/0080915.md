id="vi.iv.xiii.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—No Gods Which are Made
with Hands.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xiii.viii-p2"></span>“Therefore reduce your gods of gold
and silver, or any other material, to their original nature; I mean into
cups and basins and all other utensils, such as may be useful to you for
service; and those good things which were given you at first shall be
able to be restored.  But perhaps you will say, The laws of the emperors
do not permit us to do this. <span id="fr_1122"></span>[1123](#fn_1122)
  You say well that it is the law, and not the power of the vain idols
themselves, which is nothing.  How, then, have ye regarded them as gods,
who are avenged by human laws, guarded by dogs, kept by multitudes?—and
that if they are of gold, or silver, or brass.  For those of wood or
earthenware are preserved by their worthlessness, because no man desires
to steal a wooden or earthenware god!  So that your gods are exposed to
danger in proportion to the value of the material of which they are
made.  How, then, can they be gods, which are stolen, molten, weighed,
guarded?
