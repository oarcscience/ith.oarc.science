<span id="vi.iii.v.xxxv-p2"></span>But Simon hearing this, and being
smitten by his conscience, changed colour and became bloodless; for he
was afraid, if he denied it, that his house would be searched, or that
Peter in his indignation would betray him more openly, and so all would
learn what he was.  Thus he answered:  “I beseech thee, Peter, by that
good God who is in thee, to overcome the wickedness that is in me. 
Receive me to repentance, and you shall have me as an assistant in your
preaching.  For now I have learned in very deed that you are a prophet
of the true God, and therefore you alone know the secret and hidden
things of men.” <span id="fr_697"></span>[698](#fn_697)   Then said
Peter:  “You see, brethren, Simon seeking repentance; in a little while
you shall see him returning again to his infidelity.  For, thinking that
I am a prophet, forasmuch as I have disclosed his wickedness, which he
supposed to be secret and hidden, he has promised that he will repent. 
But it is not lawful for me to lie, nor must I deceive, whether this
infidel be saved or not saved.  For I call heaven and earth to witness,
that I spoke not by a prophetic spirit what I said, and what I
intimated, as far as was possible, to the listening crowds; but I
learned from some who once were his associates in his works, but have
now been converted to our faith, what things he did in secret. 
Therefore I spoke what I knew, not what I foreknew.”
