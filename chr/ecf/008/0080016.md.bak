<span id="iii.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c29"><span
id="iii.xiv-p1.1"></span>XII.—The Testament of Benjamin Concerning a
Pure Mind.</span>

<span id="iii.xiv-p2"></span>1.  <span class="c9"><span
id="iii.xiv-p2.1"></span>The</span> record of the words of Benjamin,
which he set forth to his sons, after he had lived a hundred and twenty
years.  And he kissed them, and said:  As Isaac was born to Abraham in
his hundredth year, so also was I to Jacob.  Now since Rachel died in
giving me birth, I had no milk; therefore I was suckled by Bilhah her
handmaid.  For Rachel remained barren for twelve years after that she
had borne Joseph:  and she prayed the Lord with fasting twelve days, and
she conceived and bare me.  For our father loved Rachel dearly, and
prayed that he <span id="page_36">p. 36</span> <span
id="iii.xiv-Page_36"></span>might see two sons born from her:  therefore
was I called the son of days, which is Benjamin. <span
id="fr_184"></span>[185](#fn_184.md)

<span id="iii.xiv-p4"></span>2.  When therefore I went into Egypt, and
Joseph my brother recognised me, he said unto me, What did they tell my
father in that they sold me?  And I said unto him, They dabbled thy coat
with blood and sent it, and said, Look if this is the coat of thy son. 
And he said to me, Even so, brother; for when the Ishmaelites took me,
one of them stripped off my coat, and gave me a girdle, and scourged me,
and bade me run.  And as he went away to hide my garment, a lion met
him, and slew him; and so his fellows were afraid, and sold me to their
companions.

<span id="iii.xiv-p5"></span>3.  Do ye also therefore, my children, love
the Lord God of heaven, and keep His commandments, and be followers of
the good and holy man Joseph; and let your mind be unto good, even as ye
know me.  He that hath his mind good seeth all things rightly.  Fear ye
the Lord, and love your neighbour; and even though the spirits of Beliar
allure you into all troublous wickedness, yet shall no troublous
wickedness have dominion over you, even as it had not over Joseph my
brother.  How many men wished to slay him, and God shielded him!  For he
that feareth God and loveth his neighbour cannot be smitten by Beliar’s
spirit of the air, being shielded by the fear of God; nor can he be
ruled over by the device of men or of beasts, for he is aided by the
love of the Lord which he hath towards his neighbour.  For he even
besought our father Jacob that he would pray for our brethren, that the
Lord would not impute to them the evil that they devised concerning
Joseph.  And thus Jacob cried out, My child Joseph, thou hast prevailed
over the bowels of thy father Jacob.  And he embraced him, and kissed
him for two hours, saying, In thee shall be fulfilled the prophecy of
heaven concerning the Lamb of God, even the Saviour of the world, that
spotless shall He be delivered up for transgressors, and sinless <span
id="fr_185"></span>[186](#fn_185.md) shall He be put to death for ungodly
men in the blood of the covenant, for the salvation <span
id="fr_186"></span>[187](#fn_186.md) of the Gentiles and of Israel, and
shall destroy Beliar, and them that serve him.

<span id="iii.xiv-p8"></span>4.  Know ye, my children, the end of the
good man?  Be followers of his compassion in a good mind, that ye also
may wear crowns of glory.  The good man hath not a dark eye; for he
showeth mercy to all men, even though they be sinners, even though they
devise evil concerning him.  So he that doeth good overcometh the evil,
being shielded by Him that is good; and he loveth the righteous as his
own soul.  If any one is glorified, he envieth him not; if any one is
enriched, he is not jealous; if any one is valiant, he praiseth him; he
trusteth and laudeth him that is sober-minded; he showeth mercy to the
poor; he is kindly disposed toward the weak; he singeth the praises of
God; as for him who hath the fear of God, he protecteth him as with a
shield; him that loveth God he aideth; him that rejecteth the Most High
he admonisheth and turneth back; and him that hath the grace of a good
spirit, he loveth even as his own soul.

<span id="iii.xiv-p9"></span>5.  If ye have a good mind, my children,
then will both wicked men be at peace with you, and the profligate will
reverence you and turn unto good; and the covetous shall not only cease
from their inordinate desire, but shall even give the fruits of their
covetousness to them that are afflicted.  If ye do well, even the
unclean spirits shall flee from you; yea, the very beasts shall flee
from you in dread.  For where the reverence for good works is present
unto the mind, darkness fleeth away from him.  For if any one is
injurious to a holy man, he repenteth; for the holy man showeth pity on
his reviler, and holdeth his peace.  And if any one betray a righteous
soul, and the righteous man, though praying, be humbled for a little
while, yet not long after he appeareth far more glorious, even as was
Joseph my brother.

<span id="iii.xiv-p10"></span>6.  The mind of the good man is not in the
power of the deceit of the spirit of Beliar, for the angel of peace
guideth his soul.  He gazeth not passionately on corruptible things, nor
gathereth together riches unto desire of pleasure; he delighteth not in
pleasure, he hurteth not his neighbour, he pampereth not himself with
food, he erreth not in the pride of his eyes, for the Lord is his
portion.  The good mind admitteth not the glory and dishonour of men,
neither knoweth it any guile or lie, fighting or reviling; for the Lord
dwelleth in him and lighteth up his soul, and he rejoiceth towards all
men at every time.  The good mind hath not two tongues, of blessing and
of cursing, of insult and of honour, of sorrow and of joy, of quietness
and of trouble, of hypocrisy and of truth, of poverty and of wealth; but
it hath one disposition, pure and uncorrupt, concerning all men.  It
hath no double sight, <span id="fr_187"></span>[188](#fn_187.md) nor double
hearing; for in everything which he doeth, or speaketh, or seeth, he
knoweth that the Lord watcheth his soul, and he cleanseth his mind that
he be not condemned by God and men.  But of Beliar every work is
twofold, and hath no singleness.

<span id="iii.xiv-p12"></span><span id="page_37">p. 37</span> <span
id="iii.xiv-Page_37"></span>7.  Flee ye therefore, my children, the
evil-doing of Beliar; for it giveth a sword to them that obeyeth, and
the sword is the mother of seven evils.  First the mind conceiveth
through Beliar, and first there is envy; secondly, desperation; thirdly,
tribulation; fourthly, captivity; fifthly, neediness; sixthly, trouble;
seventhly, desolation.  Therefore also Cain is delivered over to seven
vengeances by God, for in every hundred years the Lord brought one
plague upon him.  Two hundred years he suffered, and in the nine
hundredth year he was brought to desolation at the flood, for Abel his
righteous brother’s sake.  In seven <span
id="fr_188"></span>[189](#fn_188.md) hundred years was Cain judged, and
Lamech in seventy times seven; because for ever those who are likened
unto Cain in envy unto hatred of brethren shall be judged with the same
punishment.

<span id="iii.xiv-p14"></span>8.  Do ye also therefore, my children,
flee ill-doing, envy, and hatred of brethren, and cleave to goodness and
love.  He that hath a pure mind in love, looketh not after a woman unto
fornication; for he hath no defilement in his heart, because the Spirit
of God resteth in him.  For as the sun is not defiled by shining over
dung and mire, but rather drieth up both and driveth away the ill
smell:  so also the pure mind, constrained among the defilements of the
earth, rather edifieth, and itself suffereth no defilement.

<span id="iii.xiv-p15"></span>9.  Now I suppose, from the words of the
righteous Enoch, that there will be also evil-doings among you:  for ye
will commit fornication with the fornication of Sodom, and shall perish
all save a few, and will multiply inordinate lusts with women; and the
kingdom of the Lord shall not be among you, for forthwith He will take
it away.  Nevertheless the temple of God shall be built in your portion,
and shall be glorious among you.  For He shall take it, and the twelve
tribes shall be gathered together there, and all the Gentiles, until the
Most High shall send forth His salvation in the visitation of His
only-begotten one.  And He shall enter into the front <span
id="fr_189"></span>[190](#fn_189.md) of the temple, and there shall the
Lord be treated with outrage, and He shall be lifted up upon a tree. 
And the veil of the temple shall be rent, and the Spirit of God shall
descend upon the Gentiles as fire poured forth.  And He shall arise from
the grave, and shall ascend from earth into heaven:  and I know how
lowly He shall be upon the earth, and how glorious in the heaven.

<span id="iii.xiv-p17"></span>10.  Now when Joseph was in Egypt, I
longed to see his visage and the form of his countenance; and through
the prayers of Jacob my father I saw him, while awake in the daytime, in
his full and perfect shape.  Know ye therefore, my children, that I am
dying.  Work therefore truth and righteousness each one with his
neighbour, and judgment unto faithful doing, and keep the law of the
Lord and His commandments; for these things do I teach you instead of
all inheritance.  Do ye also therefore give them to your children for an
everlasting possession; for so did both Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob. 
All these things they gave us for an inheritance, saying, Keep the
commandments of God until the Lord shall reveal His salvation to all
nations.  Then shall ye see Enoch, Noah, and Shem, and Abraham, and
Isaac, and Jacob, arising on the right hand in gladness.  Then shall we
also arise, each one over our tribe, worshipping the King of heaven, who
appeared upon the earth in the form of a man of humility.  And as many
as believed on Him on the earth shall rejoice with Him; <span
id="fr_190"></span>[191](#fn_190.md) and then shall all men arise, some
unto glory and some unto shame.  And the Lord shall judge Israel first,
even for the wrong they did unto Him; for when He appeared as a
deliverer, God in the flesh, they believed Him not.  And then shall He
judge all the Gentiles, as many as believed Him not when He appeared
upon earth.  And He shall reprove Israel among the chosen ones of the
Gentiles, even as He reproved Esau among the Midianites, who deceived
their brethren, so that they fell into fornication and idolatry; and
they were alienated from God, and became as they that were no children
in the portion of them that fear the Lord.  But if ye walk in holiness
in the presence of the Lord, ye shall dwell in hope again in me, and all
Israel shall be gathered unto the Lord.

<span id="iii.xiv-p19"></span>11.  And I shall no longer be called a
ravening wolf <span id="fr_191"></span>[192](#fn_191.md) on account of your
ravages, but a worker of the Lord, distributing food to them that work
what is good.  And one <span id="fr_192"></span>[193](#fn_192.md) shall
rise up from my seed in the latter times, beloved of the Lord, hearing
upon the earth His voice, enlightening with new knowledge all the
Gentiles, bursting in upon Israel for salvation with the light of
knowledge, and tearing it away from it like a wolf, and giving it to the
synagogue of the Gentiles.  And until the consummation of the ages shall
he be in the synagogues of the Gentiles, and among their rulers, as a
strain of music in the mouth of all; <span
id="fr_193"></span>[194](#fn_193.md) and he shall be inscribed in the holy
books, both his work and his word, and he shall be a chosen one of God
for ever; and because of him my father Jacob instructed me, saying, He
shall fill up that which lacketh of thy tribe.

<span id="iii.xiv-p23"></span><span id="page_38">p. 38</span> <span
id="iii.xiv-Page_38"></span>12.  And when he finished his words, he
said:  I charge you, my children, carry up my bones out of Egypt, and
bury me at Hebron, near my fathers.  So Benjamin died a hundred and
twenty-five years old, in a good old age, and they placed him in a
coffin.  And in the ninety-first year of the departure of the children
of Israel from Egypt, they and their brethren brought up the bones of
their fathers secretly in a place which is called Canaan; and they
buried them in Hebron, by the feet of their fathers.  And they returned
from the land of Canaan, and dwelt in Egypt until the day of their
departing from the land of Egypt.

<span id="iii.xiv-p3"></span> The ordinary theory as to the meaning of
Benjamin is comparatively late, and seems doubtful.  The *Targum

Benjamin and Benoni synonymous.  Cf. Josephus, *Antiq*., i. 21. 3;
