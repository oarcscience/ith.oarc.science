<span id="x.v.vi"></span>

<span id="x.v.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="x.v.vi-p1.1"></span>V. <span id="fr_3596"></span>[3597](#fn_3596.md)
</span>

<span id="x.v.vi-p3"></span>This is He who took a bodily form in the
Virgin, and was hanged upon the tree, and was buried within the earth,
and suffered not dissolution; He who rose from the place of the dead,
and raised up men from the earth—from the grave below to the height of
heaven.  This is the Lamb that was slain; this is the Lamb that opened
not His mouth. <span id="fr_3597"></span>[3598](#fn_3597.md)   This is He
who was born of Mary, fair sheep *of the fold*.  This is He that was
taken from the flock, and was led to the slaughter, and was slain in the
evening, and was buried at night; He who had no bone of Him broken on
the tree; He who suffered not dissolution within the earth; He who rose
from the place of the dead, and raised up the race of Adam from the
grave below, This is He who was put to death.  And where was He put to
death?  In the midst of Jerusalem.  By whom?  By Israel:  because He
cured their lame, and cleansed their lepers, and gave light to their
blind, and raised their dead!  This was the cause of His death.  Thou,
*O Israel*, wast giving commands, and He was being crucified; thou wast
rejoicing, and He was being buried; thou wast reclining on a soft couch,
and He was watching in the grave and the shroud. <span
id="fr_3598"></span>[3599](#fn_3598.md)   O Israel, transgressor of the
law, why hast thou committed this new iniquity, subjecting the Lord to
new sufferings—thine own Lord, Him who fashioned thee, Him who made
thee, Him who honoured thee, who called thee Israel?  But thou hast not
been found to be Israel:  for thou hast not seen God, nor understood the
Lord.  Thou hast not known, O Israel, that this was the first-born of
God, who was begotten before the sun, who made the light to shine forth,
who lighted up the day, who separated the darkness, who fixed the first
foundations, who poised the earth, who collected the ocean, who
stretched out the firmament, who adorned the world.  Bitter *were* thy
nails, and sharp; bitter thy tongue, which thou didst whet; bitter *was*
Judas, to whom thou gavest hire; bitter thy false witnesses, whom thou
stirredst up; bitter thy gall, which thou preparedst; bitter thy
vinegar, which thou madest; bitter thy hands, filled with blood.  Thou
slewest thy Lord, and He was lifted up upon the tree; and an inscription
was fixed *above*, to show who He was that was slain.  And who was this?
(that which we shall not say is *too* shocking *to hear*, and that which
we shall say is very dreadful:  nevertheless hearken, and tremble.)  *It
was* He because of whom the earth quaked.  He that hung up the earth *in
space* was *Himself* hanged up; He that fixed the heavens was fixed
*with nails;* He that bore up the earth was borne up on a tree; the Lord
*of all* was subjected to ignominy in a naked body—God put to death! the
King of Israel slain with Israel’s right hand!  Alas for the new
wickedness of the new murder!  The Lord was exposed with naked body:  He
was not deemed worthy even of covering; and, in order that He might not
be seen, the luminaries turned away, and the day became darkened <span
id="fr_3599"></span>[3600](#fn_3599.md) because they slew God, who hung
naked on the tree.  It was not the body of our Lord that the luminaries
covered with darkness when they set, <span
id="fr_3600"></span>[3601](#fn_3600.md) but the eyes of men.  <span
id="page_758">p. 758</span> <span id="x.v.vi-Page_758"></span>For,
because the people quaked not, the earth quaked; because they were not
affrighted, the earth was affrighted.  Thou smotest thy Lord:  thou also
hast been smitten upon the earth.  And thou indeed liest dead; but He is
risen from the place of the dead, and ascended to the height of heaven,
having suffered for the sake of those who suffer, and having been bound
for the sake of Adam’s race which was imprisoned, and having been judged
for the sake of him who was condemned, and having been buried for the
sake of him who was buried.

<span id="x.v.vi-p8"></span>*And further on:*—This is He who made the
heaven and the earth, and in the beginning, together with the Father,
fashioned man; who was announced by means of the law and the prophets;
who put on a bodily form in the Virgin; who was hanged upon the tree;
who was buried in the earth; who rose from the place of the dead, and
ascended to the height of heaven, and sitteth on the right hand of the
Father.
