<span id="vi.iii.xii.xliv-p2"></span>“But if he who comes to repentance
is of more advanced age, he ought the more to give thanks to God,
because, having received the knowledge of the truth, after all the
violence of carnal lust has been broken, there awaits him no fight of
contest, by which to repress the pleasures of the body rising against
the mind.  It remains, therefore, that he be exercised in the learning
of the truth, and in works of mercy, that he may bring forth fruits
worthy of repentance; and that he do not suppose that the proof of
conversion is shown by length of time, but by strength of devotion and
of purpose.  For minds are manifest to God; and He does not take account
of times, but of hearts.  For He approves if any one, on hearing the
preaching of the truth, does not delay, nor spend time in negligence,
but immediately, and if I may say so, in the same moment, abhorring the
past, begins to desire things to come, and burns with love of the
heavenly kingdom.
