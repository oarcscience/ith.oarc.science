of Mind.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.ix.xxv-p2"></span>“Thus we are shut up to the
supposition that there is an unbegotten artificer, who brought the
elements together, if they were separate; or, if they were together,
artistically blended them so as to generate life, and perfected from all
one work.  For it cannot be that a work which is completely wise can be
made without a mind which is greater than it.  Nor will it do to say
that love is the artificer of all things, or desire, or power, or any
such thing.  All these are liable to change, and transient in their very
nature.  Nor can that be God which is moved by another, much less what
is altered by time and nature, and can be annihilated.” <span

noteworthy, not only from the fairness of the argument, but from the
skill with which the position of Clement, as a heathen inquirer, is
maintained.—R.\]
