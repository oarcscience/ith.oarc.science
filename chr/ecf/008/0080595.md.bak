<span id="vi.iv.iii.vi-p2"></span>“Now, if you were occupied with
secular cares, you should deceive both yourself and your hearers.  For
not being able, on account of occupation, to point out the things that
are advantageous, both you should be punished, as not having taught what
was profitable, and they, not having learned, should perish by reason of
ignorance.  Wherefore do you indeed preside over them without
occupation, so as to send forth seasonably the words that are able to
save them; and so let them listen to you, knowing that whatever the
ambassador of the truth shall bind upon earth is bound also in heaven,
and what he shall loose is loosed.  But you shall bind what ought to be
bound, and loose what ought to be loosed.  And these, and such like, are
the things that relate to you as president.
