Testament Written to Try Us.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxi.xx-p2"></span>“But one might with good reason
maintain that it was with reference to those who thought Him to be such
that the statement was made, ‘No one knoweth the Father but the Son, as
no one knoweth even the Son, but the Father.’  And reasonably.  For if
they had known, they would not have sinned, by trusting to the books
written against God, really for the purpose of trying.  But somewhere
also He says, wishing to exhibit the cause of their error more
distinctly to them, ‘On this account ye do err, not knowing the true
things of the Scriptures, on which account ye are ignorant also of the
power of God.’ <span id="fr_1398"></span>[1399](#fn_1398)   Wherefore
every man who wishes to be saved must become, as the Teacher said, a
judge of the books written to try us.  For thus He spake:  ‘Become
experienced bankers.’  Now the need of bankers arises from the
circumstance that the spurious is mixed up with the genuine.”
