<span id="vi.iii.xii.xxxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iii.xii.xxxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXIII.—Allegory of Jupiter,
Etc.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.xii.xxxiii-p2"></span>“Now this Jupiter the Greeks
would have to be called from his living, or giving life, but our people
from his giving succour. <span id="fr_871"></span>[872](#fn_871.md)   They
say, therefore, that this is the living substance, which, placed in the
upper regions, and drawing all things to itself by the influence of
heat, as by the convolution of the brain, and arranging them by the
moderation of a certain tempering, is said from his head to have
produced wisdom, whom they call Minerva, who was called <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.iii.xii.xxxiii-p3.1"></span>᾽Αθήνη</span> by
the Greeks on account of her immortality; who, because the father of all
created all things by his wisdom, is also said to have been produced
from his head, and from the principal place of all, and is represented
as having formed and adorned the whole world by the regulated admixture
of the elements. <span id="fr_872"></span>[873](#fn_872.md)   Therefore the
forms which were impressed upon matter, that the world might be made,
because they are constrained by the force of heat, are said to be held
together by the energy of Jupiter.  And since there are enough of these,
and they do not need anything new to be added to them, but each thing is
repaired by the produce of its own seed, the hands of Saturn are said to
be bound by Jupiter; because, as I have said, time now produces from
matter nothing new:  but the warmth of seeds restores all things
according to their kinds; and no birth of Rhea—that is, no increase of
flowing matter—ascends further.  And therefore they call that first
division of the elements the mutilation of Saturn, because he cannot any
more produce a world.
