<span id="vi.iv.iii.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.iii.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIV.—The Vessel of the
Church.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.iii.xiv-p2"></span>“For the whole business of the Church
is like unto a great ship, bearing through a violent storm men who are
of many places, and who desire to inhabit the city of the good kingdom. 
Let, therefore, God be your shipmaster; and let the pilot be likened to
Christ, the mate <span id="fr_897"></span>[898](#fn_897) to the bishop,
and the sailors to the deacons, the midshipmen to the catechists, the
multitude of the brethren to the passengers, the world to the <span
id="page_221">p. 221</span> <span
id="vi.iv.iii.xiv-Page_221"></span>sea; the foul winds to temptations,
persecutions, and dangers; and all manner of afflictions to the waves;
the land winds and their squalls to the discourses of deceivers and
false prophets; the promontories and rugged rocks to the judges in high
places threatening terrible things; the meetings of two seas, and the
wild places, to unreasonable men and those who doubt of the promises of
truth.  Let hypocrites be regarded as like to pirates.  Moreover,
account the strong whirlpool, and the Tartarean Charybdis, and murderous
wrecks, and deadly founderings, to be nought but sins.  In order,
therefore, that, sailing with a fair wind, you may safely reach the
haven of the hoped-for city, pray so as to be heard.  But prayers become
audible by good deeds.

<span id="vi.iv.iii.xiv-p3"></span> It is impossible to translate these
terms very accurately.  I suppose the <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.iii.xiv-p3.1"></span>πρωρεύς</span> was rather the
“bow-oarsman” in the galley.
