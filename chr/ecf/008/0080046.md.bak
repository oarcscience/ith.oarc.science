id="v.iv.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII.—Uses of Considering Admonitory
Examples, as Well as Instructive Patterns.</span>

<span id="v.iv.vii-p2"></span>Let us consider, therefore, my brethren,
and see how all the righteous fathers conducted themselves during the
whole time of their sojourn in *this* life, and let us search and
examine from the law *down* to the New Testament.  For this is both
becoming and profitable, that we should know how many men there have
been, and who *they were*, that have perished through women; and who and
how many have been the women that have perished through men, by reason
of the constancy with which they have associated with one another.  And
further, also, for the same reason, I will show how many have been the
men, and who *they were*, that lived all their lifetime, and continued
even to the close, with one another in *the performance of* chaste works
without blemish.  And it is manifest and well-known that this is
so. <span id="fr_469"></span>[470](#fn_469.md)
