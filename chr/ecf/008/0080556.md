id="vi.iii.xii.xlviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLVIII.—Errors of the
Philosophers.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.xii.xlviii-p2"></span>“But some one will say that
precepts of this sort are given by the philosophers also. <span
id="fr_877"></span>[878](#fn_877.md)   Nothing of the kind:  for they do
indeed give commandments concerning justice and sobriety, but they are
ignorant that God is the recompenser of good and evil deeds; and
therefore their laws and precepts only shun a public accuser, but cannot
purify the conscience.  For why should one fear to sin in secret, who
does not know that there is a witness and a judge of secret things? 
Besides, the philosophers in their precepts add that even the gods, who
are demons, are to be honoured; and this alone, even if in other
respects they seemed worthy of approbation, is sufficient to convict
them of the most dreadful im<span id="page_205">p. 205</span> <span
id="vi.iii.xii.xlviii-Page_205"></span>piety, and condemn them by their
own sentence, since they declare indeed that there is one God, yet
command that many be worshipped, by way of humouring human error.  But
also the philosophers say that God is not angry, not knowing what they
say.  For anger is evil, when it disturbs the mind, so that it loses
right counsel.  But that anger which punishes the wicked does not bring
disturbance to the mind; but it is one and the same affection, so to
speak, which assigned rewards to the good and punishment to the evil;
for if He should bestow blessings upon the good and the evil, and confer
equal rewards upon the pious and the impious, He would appear to be
unjust rather than good.
