<span id="vi.iii.xi.xxvi-p2"></span>“But some one skilled in the science
of mathematics will say that <span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iii.xi.xxvi-p2.1"></span>Genesis</span> is divided into seven
parts, which they call climates, and that over each climate one of the
seven heavenly bodies bears rule; and that those diverse laws to which
we have referred are not given by men, but by those dominant stars
according to their will, and that that which pleases the star is
observed by men as a law.  To this we shall answer, in the first place,
that the world is not divided into seven parts; and in the second place,
that if it were so, we find many different laws in one part and one
country; and therefore there are neither seven *laws* according to the
number of the heavenly bodies, nor twelve according to the number of the
signs, nor thirty-six according to that of the divisions of ten degrees;
but they are innumerable.
