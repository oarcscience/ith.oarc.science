id="vi.iv.vi.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIII.—Prophetic Knowledge
Constant.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.vi.xiii-p2"></span>“Wherefore He confidently made
statements respecting things that are to be—I mean sufferings, places,
limits.  For, being a faultless Prophet, and looking upon all things
with the boundless eye of His soul, He knows hidden things.  But if we
should hold, as many do, that even the true Prophet, not always, but
sometimes, when He has the Spirit, and through it, foreknows, but when
He has it not is ignorant,—if we should suppose thus, we should deceive
ourselves and mislead others.  For such a matter belongs to those who
are madly inspired by the spirit of disorder—to those who are drunken
beside the altars, and are gorged with fat.
