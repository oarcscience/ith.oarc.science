House.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.x.xxxviii-p2"></span>To these counsels of Peter we
willingly assented, saying to him that we should do nothing but what was
pleasing to him.  Then said he:  “That you may therefore be exercised
without danger, each of you conduct the discussion in my presence, one
succeeding another, and each one elucidating his own questions.  Now,
then, as Niceta discoursed sufficiently yesterday, let Aquila conduct
the discussion to-day; and after Aquila, Clement; and then I, if the
case shall require it, will add something.”  Meantime, while we were
talking in this way, we came to the house; and the master of the house
welcomed us, and led us to a certain apartment, arranged after the
manner of a theatre, and beautifully built.  There we found great crowds
waiting for us, who had come during the night, and amongst them the old
man who had argued with us yesterday.  Therefore we entered, having
Peter in the midst of us, looking about if we could see the old man
anywhere; and when Peter saw him hiding in the midst of the crowd, he
called him to him, saying:  “Since you possess a soul more enlightened
than most, why do you hide yourself, and conceal yourself in modesty? 
Rather come hither, and propound your sentiments.”
