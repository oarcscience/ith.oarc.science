<span id="vi.iii.v.xiii-p2"></span>Then said Peter:  “I shall speak, not
as under compulsion from you, but at the request of the hearers.  The
power of choice is the sense of the soul, possessing a quality by which
it can be inclined towards what acts it wills.”  Then Simon, applauding
Peter for what he had spoken, said:  “Truly you have expounded it
magnificently and incomparably, for it is my duty to bear testimony to
your speaking well.  Now if you will explain to me this which I now ask
you, in all things else I shall submit to you.  What I wish to learn,
then, is this:  if what God wishes to be, is; and what He does not wish
to be, is not.  Answer me this.”  Then Peter:  “If you do not know that
you are asking an absurd and incompetent question, I shall pardon you
and explain; but if you are aware that you are asking inconsequently,
you do not well.”  Then Simon said:  “I swear by the Supreme Divinity,
whatsoever that may be, which judges and punishes those who sin, that I
know not what I have said inconsequently, or what absurdity there is in
my words, that is, in those that I have just uttered.”
