Interrupted.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xi.iii-p2"></span>But awaking about the second
cock-crowing, he found us astir.  We were in all sixteen, viz., Peter
himself, and I Clement, Nicetas and Aquila, and the twelve who had
preceded us. <span id="fr_1087"></span>[1088](#fn_1087)   Having
therefore saluted us, he said, “To-day, <span id="page_271">p.
271</span> <span id="vi.iv.xi.iii-Page_271"></span>not being occupied
with those without, we are free to be occupied with one another. 
Wherefore I shall tell you the things that happened after your departure
from Tyre; and do you minutely relate to me what have been the doings of
Simon here.”  While, therefore, we were answering one another by
narratives on either side, one of our friends entered, and announced to
Peter that Simon, learning of his arrival, had set off for Syria, and
that the multitudes, thinking this one night to be like a year’s time,
and not able to wait for the appointment which he had made, were
standing before the doors conversing with one another in knots and
circles about the accusation brought by Simon, and how that, having
raised their expectations, and promised that he would charge Peter when
he came with many evils, he had fled by night when he knew of his
arrival.  “However,” said he, “they are eager to hear you; and I know
not whence some rumour has reached them to the effect that you are going
to address them to-day.  In order, therefore, that they may not when
they are very tired be dismissed without reason, you yourself know what
it is proper for you to do.”
