<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.v.xviii-p2"></A>&#8220;Since, then, as I said, some men do not know the rule of combination, thence they do not know who is my precursor Simon.&#160; For if he were known, he would not be believed; but now, not being known, he is improperly believed; and though his deeds are those of a hater, he is loved; and though an enemy, he is received as a friend; and though he be death, he is desired as a saviour; and though fire, he is esteemed as light; and though a deceiver, he is believed as a speaker of truth.&#8221;</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vi.iv.v.xviii-p3"></A>Then I Clement, when I heard this, said, &#8220;Who then, I pray you, is this who is such a deceiver?&#160; I should like to be informed.&#8221;&#160; Then said Peter:&#160; &#8220;If you wish to learn, it is in your power to know it from those from whom I also got accurate information on all points respecting him.</p>
