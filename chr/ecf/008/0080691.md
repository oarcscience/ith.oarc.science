id="vi.iv.vi.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.—Snares Laid for the
Gentiles.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.vi.iv-p2"></span>“And with us, indeed, who have had
handed down from our forefathers the worship of the God who made all
things, and also the mystery of the books which are able to deceive, he
will not prevail; but with those from amongst the Gentiles who have the
polytheistic fancy bred in them, and who know not the falsehoods of the
Scriptures, he will prevail much.  And not only he; but if any other
shall recount to those from among the Gentiles any vain, dreamlike,
richly set out story against God, he will be believed, because from
their childhood their minds are accustomed to take in things spoken
against God.  And few there shall be of them, as a few out of a
multitude, who through ingenuousness shall not be willing so much as to
hear an evil word against the God who made all things.  And to these
alone from amongst the Gentiles it shall be vouchsafed to be saved.  Let
not any one of you, therefore, altogether complain of Simon, or of any
one else; for nothing happens unjustly, since even the falsehoods of
Scripture are with good reason presented for a test.”
