<span id="vii.xiv.v-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vii.xiv.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter 5 (21).</span>

<span id="vii.xiv.v-p2"></span>While Satan and Hades were thus speaking
to each other, there was a great voice like thunder, saying:  Lift up
your gates, O ye rulers; and be ye lifted up, ye everlasting gates; and
the King of glory shall come in. <span
id="fr_1942"></span>[1943](#fn_1942.md)   When Hades heard, he said to
Satan:  Go forth, if thou art able, and withstand him.  Satan therefore
went forth to the outside.  Then Hades says to his demons:  Secure well
and strongly the gates of brass and the bars of iron, and attend to my
bolts, and stand in order, <span id="fr_1943"></span>[1944](#fn_1943.md)
and see to <span id="page_437">p. 437</span> <span
id="vii.xiv.v-Page_437"></span>everything; for if he come in here, woe
will seize us.

<span id="vii.xiv.v-p5"></span>The forefathers having heard this, began
all to revile him, saying:  O all-devouring and insatiable! open, that
the King of glory may come in.  David the prophet says:  Dost thou not
know, O blind, that I when living in the world prophesied this saying: 
Lift up your gates, O ye rulers?  Hesaias said:  I, foreseeing this by
the Holy Spirit, wrote:  The dead shall rise up, and those in their
tombs shall be raised, and those in the earth shall rejoice. <span
id="fr_1944"></span>[1945](#fn_1944.md)   And where, O death, is thy sting?
where, O Hades, is thy victory? <span
id="fr_1945"></span>[1946](#fn_1945.md)

<span id="vii.xiv.v-p8"></span>There came, then, again a voice saying: 
Lift up the gates.  Hades, hearing the voice the second time, answered
as if forsooth he did not know, and says:  Who is this King of glory? 
The angels of the Lord say:  The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty
in battle. <span id="fr_1946"></span>[1947](#fn_1946.md)   And immediately
with these words the brazen gates were shattered, and the iron bars
broken, and all the dead who had been bound came out of the prisons, and
we with them.  And the King of glory came in in the form of a man, and
all the dark places of Hades were lighted up.
