<span id="vi.iv.iv.i-p6"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iv.iv.i-p6.1"></span>I Clement</span>, being a Roman
citizen, <span id="fr_899"></span>[900](#fn_899.md) even from my earliest
youth was able to live chastely, my mind from my boyhood drawing away
the lust that was in me to dejection and distress.  For I had a habit of
reasoning—how originating I know not—making frequent cogitations
concerning death:  When I die, shall I neither exist, nor shall any one
ever have any remembrance of me, while boundless time bears all things
of all men into forgetfulness? and shall I then be without being, or
acquaintance with those who are; neither knowing nor being known,
neither having been nor being?  And has the world ever been made? and
was there anything before it was made?  For if it has been always, it
shall also continue to be; but if it has been made, it shall also be
dissolved.  And after its dissolution, shall there ever be anything
again, unless, perhaps, silence and forgetfulness?  Or perhaps something
shall be which is not possible now to conceive.
