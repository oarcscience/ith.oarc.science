<span id="vii.xvi.iii-p2"></span>And when the first created, father
Adam, had heard this, that Jesus was baptized in Jordan, he cried out to
his son Seth:  Tell thy sons, the patriarchs and the prophets, all that
thou heardest from Michael the archangel when I sent thee to the gates
of paradise to implore God that he might send thee His angel to give
thee oil from the tree of mercy, with which to anoint my body when I was
sick.  Then Seth, coming near to the holy patriarchs and prophets,
said:  When I, Seth, was praying to the Lord at the gates of paradise,
behold Michael, the angel of the Lord, appeared to me, saying, I have
been sent to thee by the Lord.  I am set over the human race. <span
id="fr_1976"></span>[1977](#fn_1976.md)   And to thee, Seth, I say, do not
labour with tears in prayers and supplications on account of the oil of
the tree of mercy to anoint thy father Adam for the pain of his body,
because in no wise shalt thou receive of it, except in the last days and
times, except when five thousand and five hundred years have been
fulfilled:  then will come upon the earth the most beloved Son of God,
to raise up again the body of Adam, and the bodies of the dead; and He,
when He comes, will be baptized in Jordan.  And when he shall have come
out of the water of Jordan, then with the oil of His mercy shall He
anoint all that believe on Him; and that oil of mercy shall be for the
generation of those who shall be born out of water and the Holy Spirit
into life eternal.  Then, descending upon earth, Christ Jesus, the most
beloved Son of God, will lead our father Adam into paradise to the tree
of mercy.

<span id="vii.xvi.iii-p4"></span>And when they heard all these things
from Seth, all the patriarchs and prophets exulted with great
exultation.
