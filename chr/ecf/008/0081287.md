<span id="vii.xiii.xvii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vii.xiii.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 16.</span>

<span id="vii.xiii.xvii-p2"></span>When Joseph had thus spoken, the
chief priests cried out to the people:  We know that Jesus had a father
and mother; how can we believe that he is the Christ?  One of the
Levites answered and said:  I know the family of Jesus, noble-minded
men, <span id="fr_1926"></span>[1927](#fn_1926.md) great servants of God,
and receiving tithes from the people of the Jews.  And I know also
Symeon the <span id="page_434">p. 434</span> <span
id="vii.xiii.xvii-Page_434"></span>elder, that he received him when he
was an infant, and said to him:  Now thou sendest away Thy servant, O
Lord.

<span id="vii.xiii.xvii-p4"></span>The Jews said:  Let us now find the
three men that saw him on the Mount of Olives, that we may question
them, and learn the truth more accurately.  They found them, and brought
them before all, and made them swear to tell the truth.  And they said: 
As the God of Israel liveth, we saw Jesus alive on the Mount of Olives,
and going up into heaven.

<span id="vii.xiii.xvii-p5"></span>Then Annas and Caiaphas took the
three apart, one by one, and questioned them singly in private.  They
agreed with one another, therefore, and gave, even the three, one
account.  The chief priests answered, saying:  Our Scripture says that
every word shall be established by two or three witnesses. <span
id="fr_1927"></span>[1928](#fn_1927.md)   Joseph, then, has confessed that
he, along with Nicodemus, attended to his body, and buried him, and how
it is the truth that he has risen. <span

a question:  And how is it the truth that he has risen?
