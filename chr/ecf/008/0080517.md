<span id="vi.iii.xii.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iii.xii.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter IX.—Existence of Evil on
Astrological Principles.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.xii.ix-p2"></span>Then I answered:  “Since, therefore,
I have to deal with one who is skilled in astrological science, <span
id="fr_858"></span>[859](#fn_858) I shall treat the matter with you
according to that science, that, taking my method from those things with
which you are familiar, you may the more readily acquiesce.  Listen now,
therefore:  you confess that those things which we have mentioned are
evils, such as fevers, conflagrations, and such like.  Now these,
according to you, are said to be produced by malignant stars, such as
the humid Saturn and the hot Mars; but things contrary to these are
produced by benignant stars, such as the temperate Jupiter and the humid
Venus.  Is it not so?”  My father answered:  “It is so, my son; and it
cannot be otherwise.”  Then said I:  “Since you say, therefore, that
good things are produced by good stars—by Jupiter and Venus, for
example—let us see what is the product where any one of the evil stars
is mixed with the good, and let us understand that that is evil.  For
you lay it down that Venus makes marriages, and if she have Jupiter in
her configura<span id="page_195">p. 195</span> <span
id="vi.iii.xii.ix-Page_195"></span>tion she makes the marriages chaste;
but if Jupiter be not regarding, and Mars be present, then you pronounce
that the marriages are corrupted by adultery.”  Then said my father: 
“It is even so.”  Then I answered:  “Therefore adultery is an evil,
seeing that it is committed through the admixture of evil stars; and, to
state it in a word, all things that you say that the good stars suffer
from the mixture of evil stars, are undoubtedly to be pronounced to be
evil.  Those stars, therefore, by whose admixture we have said that
fevers, configurations, and other such like evils are produced,—those,
according to you, work also murders, adulteries, thefts, and also
produce haughty and stolid men.”
