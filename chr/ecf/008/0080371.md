with Peter.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.ix.iv-p2"></span>But when they were gone, I Clement
rejoiced greatly because he had kept me with himself, and I said to
him:  “I give thanks to God that you have not sent me forward with the
others, for I should have died through sadness.”  Then said Peter:  “And
what will happen if necessity shall demand that you be sent anywhere for
the purpose of teaching?  Would you die if you were separated from me
for a good purpose?  Would you not put a restraint upon yourself, to
bear patiently what necessity has laid upon you?  Or do you not know
that friends are always together, and are joined in memory, though they
be separated bodily; as, on the other hand, some persons are near to one
another in body, but are separate in mind?”
