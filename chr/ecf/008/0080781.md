id="vi.iv.vii.xx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XX.—False Theories of
Philosophers.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xx-p2"></span>“And some of those amongst them who
even profess to be philosophers, assert that such sins are indifferent,
and say that those who are indignant at such practices are
senseless. <span id="fr_1041"></span>[1042](#fn_1041)   For they say
that such things are not sins by nature, but have been proscribed by
laws made by wise men in early times, through their knowing that men,
through the instability of their minds, being greatly agitated on these
accounts, wage war with one another; for which reason, wise men have
made laws to proscribe such things as sins.  But this is a ridiculous
supposition.  For how can they be other than sins, which are the cause
of tumults, and murders, and every confusion?  For do not shortcomings
of life <span id="fr_1042"></span>[1043](#fn_1042) and many more evils
proceed from adultery?
