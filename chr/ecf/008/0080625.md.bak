<span id="vi.iv.iv.xv-p2"></span>But having spent *some* days, and not
having been able to recover the whole debt, for the sake of speed I
neglected the balance, as being a hindrance, and myself also set sail
for Judæa, and in fifteen days arrived at Cæsarea Stratonis. <span
id="fr_910"></span>[911](#fn_910.md)   And when I had landed, and was
seeking for a lodging, I learned that one named Peter, who was the most
esteemed disciple of the Man who had appeared in Judæa, and had done
signs and wonders, was going to have a verbal controversy next day with
Simon, a Samaritan of Gitthi.  When I heard this, I begged to be shown
his lodging; and as soon as I learned it, I stood before the door.  And
those who were in the house, seeing me, discussed the question who I
was, and whence I had come.  And, behold, Barnabas came out; and as soon
as he saw me he embraced me, rejoicing greatly, and weeping.  And he
took me by the hand, and conducted me to where Peter was, saying to me,
“This is Peter, of whom I told you as being the greatest in the wisdom
of God, and I have spoken to him of you continually.  Therefore enter
freely, <span id="fr_911"></span>[912](#fn_911.md) for I have told him your
excellent qualities, without falsehood; and, at the same time, have
disclosed to him your intention, so that he himself also is desirous to
see you.  Therefore I offer him a great gift when by my hands I present
you to him.”  Thus saying, he presented me, and said, “This, O Peter, is
Clement.”
