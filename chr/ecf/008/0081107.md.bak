id="vi.iv.xxi.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII.—Simon’s Opinions Expounded
by Peter.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxi.xii-p2"></span>“We, Simon, do not assert that from
the great power, which is also called the dominant <span
id="fr_1381"></span>[1382](#fn_1381.md) power, two angels were sent forth,
the one to create the world, the other to give the law; nor that each
one when he came proclaimed himself, on account of what he had done, as
the sole creator; nor that there is one who stands, will stand, and is
opposed. <span id="fr_1382"></span>[1383](#fn_1382.md)   Learn how you
disbelieve even in respect to this subject.  If you say that there is an
unrevealed power, that power is full of ignorance.  For it did not
foreknow the ingratitude of the angels who were sent by it.”  And Simon
became exceedingly angry with Peter for saying this, and interrupted his
discourse, saying:  “What nonsense is this you speak, you daring and
most impudent of men, revealing plainly before the multitudes the secret
doctrines, so that they can be easily learned?”  And Peter said:  “Why
do you grudge that the present audience should receive benefit?”  And
Simon said:  “Do you then allow that such knowledge is a benefit?”  And
Peter said:  “I allow it:  for the knowledge of a false doctrine is
beneficial, inasmuch as you do not fall into it because of ignorance.” 
And Simon said:  “You are evidently not able to reply to the
propositions I laid before you.  I maintain that even your teacher
affirms that there is some Father unrevealed.”

<span id="vi.iv.xxi.xii-p4"></span> The text is corrupt.  Various
emendations have been proposed, none of which are satisfactory.  Uhlhorn
proposes, “That there is a standing one, one who will stand.  You who
are opposed, learn how you disbelieve, and that this subject which you
say is the power unrevealed is full of ignorance.”  P. 328, note 1.
