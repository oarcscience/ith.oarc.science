<span id="vi.iii.v.x-p2"></span>Then Simon:  “On what subject do you
wish the discussion to be held?  Tell me, that I also may define what I
think, and so the inquiry may begin.”  And Peter answered:  “If indeed,
you will do as I think right, I would have it done according to the
precept of my Master, who first of all commanded the Hebrew nation, whom
He knew to have knowledge of God, and that it is He who made the world,
not that they should inquire about Him whom they knew, but that, knowing
Him, they should investigate His will and His righteousness; because it
is placed in men’s power that, searching into these things, they may
find, and do, and observe those things concerning which they are to be
judged.  Therefore He commanded us to inquire, not whence evil cometh,
as you asked just now, but to seek the righteousness of the good God,
and His kingdom; and all these things, says He, shall be added to
you.” <span id="fr_680"></span>[681](#fn_680)   Then Simon said:  “Since
these things are commanded to Hebrews, as having a right knowledge of
God, and being of opinion that every one has it in his power to do these
things concerning which he is to be judged,—but my opinion differs from
theirs,—where do you wish me to begin?”
