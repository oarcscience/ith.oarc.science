<span id="vi.iv.xv.v-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.xv.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V.—Clement’s Office of
Service.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xv.v-p2"></span>Then I answered, “Do not think, my lord,
that I should endure that grief foolishly, but with some good reason. 
For since I hold you, my lord, in place of all, father, mother,
brothers, relatives, you who are the means through God of my having the
saving truth, holding you in place of all, I have the greatest
consolation.  And in addition to this, being afraid of my natural
youthful lust, I was concerned lest, being left by you (being but a
young man, and having now such a resolution that it would be impossible
to desert you without incurring the anger of God,) <span
id="fr_1142"></span>[1143](#fn_1142) I should be overcome by lust.  But
since it is much better and safer for me to remain with you, when my
mind is with good reason set upon venerating, therefore I pray that I
may always remain with you.  Moreover, I remember you saying in Cæsarea,
‘If any one wishes to journey with me, let him piously journey.’  And by
<span class="c9"><span id="vi.iv.xv.v-p3.1"></span>piously</span> you
meant, that those who are devoted to the worship of God should grieve no
one in respect of God, such as by leaving parents, an attached wife, or
any others. <span id="fr_1143"></span>[1144](#fn_1143)   Whence I am in
all respects a fitting fellow-traveller for you, to whom, if you would
confer the greatest favour, you would allow to perform the functions of
a servant.”

<span id="vi.iv.xv.v-p3"></span> Here the text is hopelessly corrupt,
and the meaning can only be guessed at.

<span id="fn_1143"></span>[293:1144](0080976.htm#fr_1143) <span
id="vi.iv.xv.v-p3.2"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.xv.v-p4"></span> I have ventured to make a very slight
change on the reading here, so as to bring out what I suppose to be the
sense.
