<span id="vi.iv.vi.xli-p2"></span>Then said Simon:  “You are manifestly
avoiding the hearing of the charge from the Scriptures against your
God.”  Then Peter:  “You yourself appear to me to be doing this; for he
who avoids the order of inquiry, does not wish a true investigation to
be made.  Hence I, who proceed in an orderly manner, and wish that the
writer should first be considered, am manifestly desirous to walk in a
straight path.”  Then Simon:  “First confess that if the things written
against the Creator are true, he is not above all, since, according to
the Scriptures, he is subject to all evil; then afterwards we shall
inquire as to the writer.”  Then said Peter:  “That I may not seem to
speak against your want of order through unwillingness to enter upon the
investigation, <span id="fr_984"></span>[985](#fn_984) I answer you.  I
say that if the things written against God are true, they do not show
that God is wicked.”  Then said Simon:  “How can you maintain that?”
