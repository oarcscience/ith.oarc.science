<span id="vii.xvii.v-p2"></span>Then all the saints, hearing this again,
exulted in joy.  And one of those standing round, Isaias by name, cried
out aloud, and thundered:  Father Adam, and all standing round, hear my
declaration.  When I was on earth, and by the teaching of the Holy
Spirit, in prophecy I sang of this light:  The people who sat in
darkness have seen a great light; to them dwelling in the region of the
shadow of death light has arisen.  At these words father Adam, and all
of them, turned and asked him:  Who art thou? because what thou sayest
is true.  And he subjoined, and said:  My name is Isaias.

<span id="vii.xvii.v-p3"></span>Then appeared another near him, as if a
hermit.  And they asked him, saying:  Who art thou, who bearest such an
appearance in thy body? <span id="fr_2008"></span>[2009](#fn_2008.md)   And
he firmly answered:  I am John the Baptist, voice and prophet of the
Most High.  I went before the face of the same Lord, that I might make
the waste and rough places into plain ways.  I with my finger pointed
out and made manifest the Lamb of the Lord, and Son of God, to the
inhabitants of Jerusalem.  I baptized Him in the river Jordan.  I heard
the voice of the Father from heaven thundering over Him, and
proclaiming, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.  I
received from Him the answer that He would descend to the lower world

id="vii.xvii.v-Page_457"></span>Then father Adam, hearing this, cried
with a loud voice, exclaiming:  Alleluia! which is, interpreted, The
Lord is certainly coming.
