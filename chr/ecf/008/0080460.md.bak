<span id="vi.iii.x.liv-p2"></span>To this the old man answered:  “Show
me a way, my son, by which I may establish in my mind one or other of
these two orders, the one of which asserts, and the other denies,
providence.”  “To one having a right judgment,” says Aquila, “the
decision is easy.  For this very thing that you say, order and disorder,
may be produced by a contriver, but not by insensible nature.  For let
us suppose, by way of illustration, that a great mass were torn from a
high rock, and cast down headlong, and when clashed upon the ground were
broken into many pieces, <span id="page_180">p. 180</span> <span
id="vi.iii.x.liv-Page_180"></span>could it in any way happen that,
amongst that multitude of fragments, there should be found even one
which should have any perfect figure and shape?”  The old man answered: 
“It is impossible.”  “But,” said Aquila, “if there be present a
statuary, he can by his skilful hand and reasonable mind form the stone
cut from the mountain into whatever figure he pleases.”  The old man
said:  “That is true.”  “Therefore,” says Aquila, “when there is not a
rational mind, no figure can be formed out of the mass; but when there
is a designing mind, there may be both form and deformity:  for example,
if a workman cuts from the mountain a block to which he wishes to give a
form, he must first cut it out unformed and rough; then, by degrees
hammering and hewing it by the rule of his art, he expresses the form
which he has conceived in his mind.  Thus, therefore, from informity or
deformity, by the hand of the workman form is attained, and both proceed
from the workman.  In like manner, therefore, the things which are done
in the world are accomplished by the providence of a contriver, although
they may seem not quite orderly.  And therefore, because these two ways
have been made known to you, and you have heard the divisions of them,
flee from the way of unbelief, lest haply it lead you to that prince who
delights in evils; but follow the way of faith, that you may come to
that King who delighteth in good men.”
