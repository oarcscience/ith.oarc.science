<span id="vii.xiii.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vii.xiii.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 2.</span>

<span id="vii.xiii.iii-p2"></span>Pilate says to Jesus:  Hearest thou
what these testify against thee, and answerest thou not? <span
id="fr_1874"></span>[1875](#fn_1874.md)   And Jesus answered and said: 
Every man has power to speak either good or bad, as he wishes; these
also, therefore, having power, say what they wish. <span
id="fr_1875"></span>[1876](#fn_1875.md)

<span id="vii.xiii.iii-p5"></span>The Jews said to Him:  What have we to
say about thee?  First, that thou wast begotten from sin; second, that
on account of thee, when thou wast born, the infants <span
id="fr_1876"></span>[1877](#fn_1876.md) were murdered; third, that thy
father and thy mother fled into Egypt, because they had no confidence in
the people.

<span id="vii.xiii.iii-p7"></span>To these the Jews who were there
present, God-fearing men, answered and said:  We say that his birth is
not from sin; for we know that Joseph received into keeping his mother
Mary, according to the practice of betrothal.  Pilate said: 
Consequently you lie who say that his birth is from sin.  They say again
to Pilate:  All the people testify that he is a magician.  The
God-fearing Jews answered and said:  We also were at the betrothal of
his mother, and we are Jews, and know all his daily life; but that he is
a magician, that we do not know.  And the Jews that thus said were
these:  Lazarus, Astharius, Antonius, James, Zaras, Samuel, Isaac,
Phinees, Crispus, Dagrippus, Amese, and Judas.

<span id="vii.xiii.iii-p8"></span>Pilate therefore says to them:  By the
life of Cæsar, I wish you to swear whether the birth of this man is
without sin.  They answered:  Our law lays down that we are to swear not
at all, because an oath is great sin.  Notwithstanding, by the life of
Cæsar we swear that his birth is without sin; and if we lie, order us
all to be beheaded.  And when they had thus spoken, the Jews that were
bringing the charge answered Pilate, and said:  And dost thou believe
these twelve single Jews more than all the multitude and us, who know
for certain that he is a magician and blasphemer, and that he names
himself Son of God?

<span id="vii.xiii.iii-p9"></span>Then Pilate ordered them all to go
forth out of the prætorium except the said twelve alone.  And when this
had been done, Pilate says to them privately:  As to this man, it
appears that from envy and madness the Jews wish to murder him:  for of
one thing—that he does away with the Sabbath—they accuse him; but he
then does a good work, because he cures the sick.  For this, sentence of
death is not upon the man.  The twelve also say to him:  Assuredly, my
lord, it is so.
