id="vi.iii.v.lvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter LXVI.—Zacchæus Made Bishop of
Cæsarea; Presbyters and Deacons Ordained.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.v.lvi-p2"></span>At this announcement all the people
wept, hearing that he was going to leave them; and Peter, sympathizing
with them, himself also shed tears; and looking up to heaven, he said: 
“To Thee, O God, who hast made heaven and earth, and all things that are
in them, we pour out the prayer of supplication, that Thou wouldest
comfort those who have recourse to Thee in their tribulation.  For by
reason of the affection that they have towards Thee, they do love me who
have declared to them Thy truth.  Wherefore guard them with the right
hand of Thy compassion; for neither Zacchæus nor any other man can be a
sufficient guardian to them.”  When he had said this, and more to the
same effect, he laid his hands upon Zacchæus, and prayed that he might
blamelessly discharge the duty of his bishopric.  Then he ordained
twelve presbyters and four deacons, and said:  “I have <span

id="vi.iii.v.lvi-Page_132"></span>ordained you this Zacchæus as a
bishop, knowing that he has the fear of God, and is expert in the
Scriptures.  You ought therefore to honour him as holding the place of
Christ, obeying him for your salvation, and knowing that whatever honour
and whatever injury is done to him, redounds to Christ, and from Christ
to God.  Hear him therefore with all attention, and receive from him the
doctrine of the faith; and from the presbyters the monitions of life;
and from the deacons the order of discipline.  Have a religious care of
widows; vigorously assist orphans; take pity on the poor; teach the
young modesty;—and in a word, sustain one another as circumstances shall
demand; worship God, who created heaven and earth; believe in Christ;
love one another; be compassionate to all; and fulfil charity not only
in word, but in act and deed.”
