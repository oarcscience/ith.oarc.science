<span id="vi.iv.vi.xxv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.vi.xxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXV.—Cain’s Name and
Nature.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.vi.xxv-p2"></span>“Hence the ambiguous name which she
gave to her first-born son, calling him <span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iv.vi.xxv-p2.1"></span>Cain</span>, which has a capability of
interpretation in two ways; <span id="fr_969"></span>[970](#fn_969.md) for
it is interpreted both <span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iv.vi.xxv-p3.1"></span>Possession</span> and <span
class="c9"><span id="vi.iv.vi.xxv-p3.2"></span>Envy</span>, as
signifying that in the future he was to envy either a woman, or
possessions, or the love of the parents towards her. <span
id="fr_970"></span>[971](#fn_970.md)   But if it be none of these, then it
will befall him to be called the <span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iv.vi.xxv-p4.1"></span>Possession</span>.  For she possessed him
first, which also was advantageous to him.  For he was a murderer and a
liar, and with his sins was not willing to be at peace with respect to
the government.  Moreover, those who came forth by succession from him
were the first adulterers.  And there were psalteries, and harps, and
forgers of instruments of war.  Wherefore also the prophecy of his
descendants being full of adulterers and of psalteries, secretly by
means of pleasures excites to wars.
