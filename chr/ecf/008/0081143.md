<span id="vi.iv.xxii.xxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.xxii.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIV.—Simon Rebuked by
Faustus.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxii.xxiv-p2"></span>And Simon hearing this, said:  “Do
not imagine that, when I, while questioning you, agreed with you in each
topic, I went to the next, as being fully assured of the truth of the
previous; but I appeared to yield to your ignorance, that you might go
on to the next topic, in order that, becoming acquainted with the whole
range of your ignorance, I might condemn you, not through mere
conjecture, but from full knowledge. <span
id="fr_1472"></span>[1473](#fn_1472)   Allow me now to retire for three
days, and I shall come back and show that you know nothing.”  When Simon
said this, and was on the point of going out, my father said:  “Listen
to me, Simon, for a moment, and then go wherever you like.  I remember
that in the beginning, before the discussion, you accused me of being
prejudiced, though as yet you had no experience of me.  But now, having
heard you discuss in turn, and judging that Peter has the advantage, and
now assigning to him the merit of speaking the truth, do I appear to you
to judge correctly, and with knowledge; <span
id="fr_1473"></span>[1474](#fn_1473) or is it not so?  For if you should
say that I have judged correctly, but do not agree, then you are plainly
prejudiced, inasmuch as you do not wish to agree, after confessing your
defeat.  But if I was not correct in maintaining that Peter has the
advantage in the discussion, do you convince us how we have not judged
correctly, or you will cease <span id="fr_1474"></span>[1475](#fn_1474)
to discuss with him before all, since you will always be defeated and
agree, and in consequence your own soul will suffer pain, condemned as
you will be, and in disgrace, through your own conscience, even if you
do not feel shame before all the listeners as the greatest torture; for
we have seen you conquered, in fact, and we have heard your own lips
confess it.  Finally, therefore, I am of opinion that you will not
return to the discussion, as you promised; but that you may seem not to
have been defeated, <span id="fr_1475"></span>[1476](#fn_1475) you have
promised, when going away, that you will return.”

<span id="vi.iv.xxii.xxiv-p3"></span> The whole of this sentence is
corrupt.  We have adopted the conjectures of Wieseler, though they are
not entirely satisfactory.

id="vi.iv.xxii.xxiv-p3.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxii.xxiv-p4"></span> Possibly something is corrupt
here.  The words may be translated:  “Is it not plain that I know how to
judge correctly?”

<span id="vi.iv.xxii.xxiv-p5"></span> The <span class="c9"><span

have omitted <span class="Greek"><span

<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.xxii.xxiv-p5.4"></span>παύσει</span>.  We have inserted the

after <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.xxii.xxiv-p5.6"></span>ἤ</span>, changed into <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.iv.xxii.xxiv-p5.7"></span>εἰ</span> before
<span class="Greek"><span

<span id="vi.iv.xxii.xxiv-p6"></span> We have adopted an emendation of
Wieseler’s.
