id="vi.iii.vi.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIII.—Evil Not in
Substance.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.vi.xxiii-p2"></span>“But if any one, proceeding more
curiously, inquire:  What then was the use of God’s making these evil
things, which should have so great a tendency to subvert the minds of
men? <span id="fr_736"></span>[737](#fn_736.md)   To one proposing such a
question, we answer that we must first of all inquire whether there is
any <span id="page_140">p. 140</span> <span
id="vi.iii.vi.xxiii-Page_140"></span>evil in substance.  And although it
would be sufficient to say to him that it is not suitable that the
creature judge the Creator, but that to judge the work of another
belongs to him who is either of equal skill or equal power; yet, to come
directly to the point, we say absolutely that there is no evil in
substance.  But if this be so, then the Creator of substance is vainly
blamed.
