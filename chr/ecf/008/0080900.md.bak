<span id="vi.iv.xii.xvii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.xii.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVII.—Reasons Why Their Deceits
are Not Detected.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xii.xvii-p2"></span>“For why do they oracularly foretell
cures after a long time?  And why, if they are almighty, do they not
effect cures without administering any medicine?  And for what reason do
they prescribe remedies to some of those who pray to them, while to
some, and it may be more suitable cases, they give no response?  Thus,
whenever a cure is going to take place spontaneously, they promise, in
order that they may get the credit of the cure; and others, having been
sick, and having prayed, and having recovered spontaneously, attributed
the cure to those whom they had invoked, and make offerings to them. 
Those, however, who, after praying, have failed, are not able to offer
their sacrifices.  But if the relatives of the dead, or any of their
children, inquired into the losses, you would find the failures to be
more than the successes.  But no one who has been taken in by them is
willing to exhibit an accusation against them, through shame or fear;
but, on the other hand, they conceal the crimes which they believe them
to be guilty of.
