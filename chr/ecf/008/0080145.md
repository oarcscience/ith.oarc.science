id="vi.iii.iv.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—Simon Magus:  His
History.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iv.viii-p2"></span>“For after that John the Baptist was
killed, as you yourself also know, when Dositheus had broached his
heresy, <span id="fr_605"></span>[606](#fn_605) with thirty other chief
disciples, and one woman, who was called *Luna* <span
id="fr_606"></span>[607](#fn_606) —whence also these thirty appear to
have been appointed with reference to the number of the days, according
to the course of the moon—this Simon ambitious of evil glory, as we have
said, goes to Dositheus, and pretending friendship, entreats him, that
if any one of those thirty should die, he should straightway substitute
him in room of the dead:  for it was contrary to their rule either to
exceed the fixed number, or to admit any one who was unknown, or not yet
proved; whence also the rest, desiring to become worthy of the place and
number, are eager in every way to please, according to the institutions
of their sect each one of those who aspire after admittance into the
number, hoping that he may be deemed worthy to be put into the place of
the deceased, when, as we have said, any one dies.  Therefore Dositheus,
being greatly urged by this man, introduced Simon when a vacancy
occurred among the number.”
