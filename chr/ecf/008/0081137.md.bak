<span id="vi.iv.xxii.xviii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.xxii.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.—Is the Devil a
Relation?</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxii.xviii-p2"></span>And Peter said:  “What you state
is impossible; for if he came into existence by degrees, <span
id="page_336">p. 336</span> <span
id="vi.iv.xxii.xviii-Page_336"></span>He could have cut him off as a foe
by His own free choice.  And knowing beforehand that he was coming into
existence, He would not have allowed him as a good, had He not known
that by reason of him what was useful was being brought into
existence. <span id="fr_1446"></span>[1447](#fn_1446.md)   And he could not
have come into existence suddenly, complete, of his own power.  For he
who did not exist could not fashion himself; and he neither could become
complete out of nothing, nor could any one justly say that he had
substance, <span id="fr_1447"></span>[1448](#fn_1447.md) so as always to be
equal in power if he were begotten.”  And Simon said:  “Is he then a
mere relation, and in this way wicked? <span
id="fr_1448"></span>[1449](#fn_1448.md) —being injurious, as water is
injurious to fire, but good for the seasonably thirsty land; as iron is
good for the cultivation of the land, but bad for murders; and lust is
not evil in respect of marriage, but bad in respect of adultery; as
murder is an evil, but good for the murderer so far as his purpose is
concerned; and cheating is an evil, but pleasant to the man who cheats;
and other things of a like character are good and bad in like manner. 
In this way, neither is evil, nor good; for the one produces the other. 
For does not that which seems to be done injuriously rejoice the doer,
but punish the sufferer?  And though it seems unjust that a man should,
out of self-love, gratify himself by every means in his power, to whom,
on the other hand, does it not seem unjust that a man should suffer
severe punishments at the hand of a just judge for having loved
himself?”

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1446"></span>[336:1447](0081137.htm#fr_1446.md) <span
id="vi.iv.xxii.xviii-p2.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxii.xviii-p3"></span> The editors punctuate
differently, thus:  “And knowing beforehand that he was becoming not
good, He would not have allowed him, unless He knew that he would be
useful to Himself.”  We suppose the reference in the text to be to [Gen.
i. 31](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#031.md)<span
id="vi.iv.xxii.xviii-p3.1"></span>.

<span id="fn_1447"></span>[336:1448](0081137.htm#fr_1447.md) <span
id="vi.iv.xxii.xviii-p3.2"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxii.xviii-p4"></span> Or, “self-subsistence.”  We have
supposed a transposition of the words in the text.  The text is without
doubt corrupt.

<span id="fn_1448"></span>[336:1449](0081137.htm#fr_1448.md) <span
id="vi.iv.xxii.xviii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxii.xviii-p5"></span> We have adopted an emendation of
Lagarde’s.
