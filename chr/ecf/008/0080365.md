id="vi.iii.viii.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIV.—Knowledge Enhances
Responsibility.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.viii.xiv-p2"></span>“And truly confusion is our worthy
portion, if we have done no more than those who are inferior to us in
knowledge.  But if it be confusion to us, to be found equal to them in
works, what shall become of us if the examination that is to take place
find us inferior and worse than them?  Hear, therefore, how our true
Prophet has taught us concerning these things; for, with respect to
those who neglect to hear the words of wisdom, He speaks thus:  ‘The
queen of the south shall rise in judgment with this generation, and
shall condemn it, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear
the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here, and
they hear Him not.’ <span id="fr_786"></span>[787](#fn_786)   But with
respect to those who refused to repent of their evil deeds, He spoke
thus:  ‘The men of Nineve shall rise in the judgment with this
generation, and shall condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of
Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.’ <span
id="fr_787"></span>[788](#fn_787)   You see, therefore, how He condemned
those who were instructed out of the law, by adducing the example of
those who came from Gentile ignorance, and showing that the former were
not even equal to those who seemed to live in error.  From all these
things, then, the statement that He propounded is proved, that chastity,
which is observed to a certain extent even by those who live in error,
should be held much more purely and strictly, in all its forms, as we
showed above, by us who follow the truth; and the rather because with us
eternal rewards are assigned to its observance.”
