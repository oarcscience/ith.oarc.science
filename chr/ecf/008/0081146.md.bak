and wakened us, and then sat down in his usual way, and said:  “Ask me
questions about anything you like.” <span

begin to speak to him:  “Will you explain to us who are eager to learn
what is the real truth in regard to evil?”  And Peter said:  “I have
already explained it in the course of my discussion with Simon; but
because I stated the truth in regard to it in combination with other
topics, it was not altogether clearly put; for many topics that seem to
be of equal weight with the truth afford some kind of knowledge of the
truth to the masses.  So that, if now I state what I formerly stated to
Simon along with many topics, do not imagine that you are *not* <span
id="fr_1478"></span>[1479](#fn_1478.md) honoured with honour equal to
his.”  And Sophonias said:  “You are right; for if you now separate it
for us from many of the topics that were then discussed, you will make
the truth more evident.”
