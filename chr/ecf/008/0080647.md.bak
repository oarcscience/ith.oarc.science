id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIV.—Righteousness and
Unrighteousness.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p2"></span>“But if any one, according to the
opinion of this Simon the Samaritan, will not admit that God is just, to
whom then can any one ascribe justice, or the possibility of it?  For if
the Root of all have it not, there is every necessity to think that it
must be impossible to find it in human nature, which, is, as it were,
the fruit.  And if it is to be found in man, how much more in God!  But
if righteousness can be found nowhere, neither in God nor in man, then
neither can unrighteousness.  But there is such a thing as
righteousness, for unrighteousness takes its name from the existence of
righteousness; for it is called unrighteousness, when righteousness is
compared with it, and is found to be opposite to it.
