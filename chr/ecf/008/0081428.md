<span id="viii.viii.ii.i-p3"></span>*That the chrism* <span
id="fr_2840"></span>[2841](#fn_2840) *should be renewed with
consecration every year, and that the old supply should be set aside to
be burnt in the churches; also concerning the accusing of priests, and
on the duty of the sheep not to dare to blame their shepherd unless he
errs in the faith.*

id="viii.viii.ii.i-p5.1"></span>Fabian</span>, bishop of the city of
Rome, to all the bishops of the East, and to the whole body of the
faithful, greeting in the Lord.

<span id="viii.viii.ii.i-p6"></span>Your love for the seat of the
apostles requires counsels which we neither can nor ought to deny you. 
It is clear, moreover, that our predecessors did this for the bishops of
many districts; and brotherly charity and the debt of obedience impose
the duty of so doing also upon us who, by the bountiful goodness of God,
are placed in the same seat.  Care, therefore, is to be had by your
solicitude, that neither remissness may avail to neglect, nor
presumption be able to disturb, those things which have been ordained by
the apostles and their successors, and established under the inspiration
of the Holy Spirit.  But as it was proper that that should be defined
which the use of right order required, so what has been so defined ought
not to be violated.
