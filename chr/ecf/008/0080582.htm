<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.i-p6"></A><span class="c9"><a name="vi.iv.i-p6.1"></A>We</span> have already given an account of the <i>Clementines</i> in the Introductory Notice to the <i>Recognitions</i>.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_887"></A><A HREF="#fn_887"><FONT SIZE="1">888</FONT></A>
&#160; All that remains for us to do here, is to notice the principal editions of the <i>Homilies</i>.&#160; The first edition was published by Cotelerius in his collection of the <i>Apostolic Fathers</i>, from a manuscript in the Royal Library at Paris, the only manuscript of the work then known to exist.&#160; He derived assistance from an epitome of the work which he found in the same library.&#160; The text of Cotelerius was revised by Clericus in his edition of Cotelerius, but more carefully by Schwegler, Stuttgart, 1847.&#160; The Paris <span class="c9"><a name="vi.iv.i-p7.1"></A>ms.</span> breaks off in the middle of the fourteenth chapter of the nineteenth book.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vi.iv.i-p8"></A>In 1853 (G&ouml;ttingen) Dressel published a new recension of the <i>Homilies</i>, having found a complete manuscript of the twenty Homilies in the Ottobonian Library in Rome.&#160; In 1859 (Leipzig) he published an edition of two Epitomes of the Homilies,&#8212;the one previously edited by Turnebus and Cotelerius being given more fully, and the other appearing for the first time.&#160; To these Epitomes were appended notes by Frederic Wieseler on the Homilies.&#160; The last edition of the <i>Clementines</i> is by Paul de Lagarde (Leipzig, 1865), which has no new sources, is pretentious, but far from accurate.</p>
