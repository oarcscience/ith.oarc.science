id="vi.iii.vii.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVII.—Suggestions of the Old
Serpent.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.vii.xvii-p2"></span>“Above all, therefore, you ought to
understand the deception of the old serpent <span
id="fr_763"></span>[764](#fn_763.md) and his cunning suggestions, who
deceives you as it were by prudence, and as by a sort of reason creeps
through your senses; and beginning at the head, he glides through your
inner marrow, accounting the deceiving of you a great gain.  Therefore
he insinuates into your minds opinions of gods of whatsoever kinds, only
that he may withdraw you from the faith of one God knowing that your sin
is his comfort.  For he, for his wickedness, was condemned from the
beginning to eat dust, for that he caused to be again resolved into dust
him who had been taken from the dust, even till the time when your souls
shall be restored, being brought through the fire; as we shall instruct
you more fully at another time.  From him, therefore, proceed all the
errors and doubts, by which you are driven from the faith and belief of
one God.

10, etc., the influence of the serpent is spoken of, but the discourse
here is much fuller. There is, however, a general agreement in outline
between chaps. 17–22 here and Homily X. 10–21.—R.\]
