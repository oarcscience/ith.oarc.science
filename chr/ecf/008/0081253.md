proprætor’s body-guard, being learned in the law, knowing our Lord Jesus
Christ from the Holy Scriptures, coming to Him by faith, and counted
worthy of the holy baptism, searching also the memorials written at that
time of what was done in the case of our Lord Jesus Christ, which the
Jews had laid up in the time of Pontius Pilate, found these memorials
written in Hebrew, and by the favour of God have translated them into
Greek for the information of all who call upon the name of our Master
Jesus Christ, in the seventeenth year of the reign of our Lord Flavius
Theodosius, and the sixth of Flavius Valentinianus, in the ninth
indiction. <span id="fr_1801"></span>[1802](#fn_1801.md)

who hear and to their households.  Amen.

and Rubellio, in the fourth year of the two hundred and second Olympiad,
Joseph Caiaphas being high priest of the Jews.

<span id="vii.xii.i-p13"></span>The account that Nicodemus wrote in
Hebrew, after the cross and passion of our Lord Jesus Christ, the
Saviour God, and left to those that came after him, is as follows:—

Pilate in both forms.  The variations here correspond with the various

respecting the beginning of the public ministry with the time of our
