<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.x.li-p2"></A>&#8220;But by the freedom of the will, every man, while he is unbelieving in regard to things to come, by evil deeds runs into evils.&#160; And these are the things in the world which seem to be done contrary to order, which owe their existence to unbelief.&#160; Therefore the dispensation of divine providence is withal to be admired, which granted to those men in the beginning, walking in the good way of life, to enjoy incorruptible good things; but when they sinned, they gave birth to evil by sin.&#160; And to every good thing evil is joined as by a certain covenant of alliance on the part of sin, since indeed the earth has been polluted with human blood, and altars have been lighted to demons, and they have polluted the very air by the filthy smoke of sacrifices; and so at length the elements, being first corrupted, have handed over to men the fault of their corruption, as roots <i>communicate their qualities</i> to the branches and the fruit.</p>
