<span id="vi.iv.xx.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.xx.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter IX.—God the Centre or Heart of the
Universe.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xx.ix-p2"></span>“One, then, is the God who truly
exists, who presides in a superior shape, being the heart of that which
is above and that which is below twice, <span
id="fr_1332"></span>[1333](#fn_1332.md) which sends forth from Him as from
a centre the life-giving and incorporeal power; the whole universe with
the stars and regions <span id="fr_1333"></span>[1334](#fn_1333.md) of the
heaven, the air, the fire, and if anything else exists, is proved to be
a substance infinite in height, boundless in depth, immeasurable in
breadth, extending the life-giving and wise nature from Him over three
infinites. <span id="fr_1334"></span>[1335](#fn_1334.md)   It must be,
therefore, that this infinite which proceeds from Him on every side
exists, <span id="fr_1335"></span>[1336](#fn_1335.md) having as its heart
Him who is above all, and who thus possesses figure; for wherever He be,
He is as it were in the centre of the infinite, being the limit of the
universe.  And the extensions taking their rise with Him, possess the
nature of six infinites; of whom the one taking its rise with Him
penetrates <span id="fr_1336"></span>[1337](#fn_1336.md) into the height
above, another into the depth below, another to the right hand, another
to the left, another in front, and another behind; to whom He Himself,
looking as to a number that is equal on every side, <span
id="fr_1337"></span>[1338](#fn_1337.md) completes the world in six temporal
intervals, <span id="fr_1338"></span>[1339](#fn_1338.md) Himself being the
rest, <span id="fr_1339"></span>[1340](#fn_1339.md) and having the infinite
age to come as His image, being the beginning and the end.  For in Him
the six infinites end, and from Him they receive their extension to
infinity.

<span id="fn_1332"></span>[320:1333](0081083.htm#fr_1332.md) <span
id="vi.iv.xx.ix-p2.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.xx.ix-p3"></span> The whole of this chapter is full of
corruption; “twice” occurs in one <span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iv.xx.ix-p3.1"></span>ms.</span>  Various attempts have been made
to amend the passage.

<span id="fn_1333"></span>[320:1334](0081083.htm#fr_1333.md) <span

<span id="vi.iv.xx.ix-p4"></span> An emendation.

<span id="fn_1334"></span>[320:1335](0081083.htm#fr_1334.md) <span
id="vi.iv.xx.ix-p4.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.xx.ix-p5"></span> The text is corrupt.  We have
translated <span class="Greek"><span id="vi.iv.xx.ix-p5.1"></span>ἐπ᾽
ἀπείρους τρεῖς</span>.  Some think “three” should be omitted.  The three
infinites are in respect of height, depth, and breadth.

<span id="fn_1335"></span>[320:1336](0081083.htm#fr_1335.md) <span
id="vi.iv.xx.ix-p5.2"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.xx.ix-p6"></span> As punctuated in Dressel, this reads,
“that the infinite is the heart.”

<span id="fn_1336"></span>[320:1337](0081083.htm#fr_1336.md) <span
id="vi.iv.xx.ix-p6.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.xx.ix-p7"></span> The emendation of the transcriber of
one of the <span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iv.xx.ix-p7.1"></span>mss.</span>

<span id="fn_1337"></span>[320:1338](0081083.htm#fr_1337.md) <span
id="vi.iv.xx.ix-p7.2"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.xx.ix-p8"></span> This refers to the following mode of
exhibiting the number:  \*\*\* where each side presents the number
three.

<span id="fn_1338"></span>[320:1339](0081083.htm#fr_1338.md) <span
id="vi.iv.xx.ix-p8.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.xx.ix-p9"></span> The creation of the world in six days.

id="vi.iv.xx.ix-p9.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.xx.ix-p10"></span> The seventh day on which God rested,
the type of the rest of the future age.  See *Epistle of Barnabas*, c.
xv.
