id="vi.iv.iii.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII.—Duties of Presbyters.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.iii.vii-p2"></span>“And with respect to the presbyters,
take these *instructions*.  Above all things, let them join the young
betimes in marriage, anticipating the entanglements of youthful lusts. 
But neither let them neglect the marriage of those who are already old;
for lust is vigorous even in some old men.  Lest, therefore, fornication
find a place among you, and bring upon you a very pestilence, take
precaution, and search, lest at any time the fire of adultery be
secretly kindled among you.  For adultery is a very terrible thing, even
such that it holds the second place in respect of punishment, the first
being assigned to those who are in error, even although they be chaste. 
Wherefore do you, as elders of the Church, exercise the spouse of Christ
to chastity (by the spouse I mean the body of the Church); for if she be
apprehended to be chaste by her royal Bridegroom, she shall obtain the
greatest honour; and you, as wedding guests, shall receive great
commendation.  But if she be caught having sinned, she herself indeed
shall be cast out; and you shall suffer punishment, if at any time her
sin has been through your negligence.
