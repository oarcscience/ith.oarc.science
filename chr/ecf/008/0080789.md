of Appion.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.viii.ii-p2"></span>“Yesterday, when I left this, O
friends, I confess that, through much anxiety about the discussion that
was to take place with Appion, I was not able to get any sleep.  And
while I was unable to sleep, I remembered a trick that I played upon him
in Rome.  It was this.  From my boyhood I Clement was a lover of truth,
and a seeker of the things that are profitable for the soul, and
spending my time in raising and refuting theories; but being unable to
find anything perfect, through distress of mind I fell sick.  And while
I was confined to bed Appion came to Rome, and being my father’s friend,
he lodged with me; and hearing that I was in bed, he came to me, as
being not unacquainted with medicine, and inquired the cause of my being
in bed.  But I, being aware that the man exceedingly hated the Jews, as
also that he had written many books against them, and that he had formed
a friendship with this Simon, not through desire of learning, but
because he knew that he was a Samaritan and a hater of the Jews, and
that he had come forth in opposition to the Jews, therefore he had
formed an alliance with him, that he might learn something from him
against the Jews; <span id="fr_1045"></span>[1046](#fn_1045.md) —
