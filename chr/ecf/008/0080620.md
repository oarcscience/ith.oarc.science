id="vi.iv.iv.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter X.—Cavils of the
Philosophers.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.iv.x-p2"></span>But while the multitudes were favourably
disposed towards the things that he so artlessly spoke, the
philosophers, impelled by their worldly learning, set upon laughing at
him and making sport of him, upbraiding and reproaching him with
excessive presumption, making use of the great armoury of syllogisms. 
But he set aside their babbling, and did not enter into their subtle
questioning, but without embarrassment went on with what he was saying. 
And then one of them asked, Wherefore it was that a gnat, although it be
so small, and has six feet, has wings also; while an elephant, the
largest of beasts, is wingless, and has but four feet?  But he, after
the question had been put, resuming his discourse, which had been
interrupted, as though he had answered the question, resumed his
original discourse, only making use of this preface after each
interruption:  We have a commission only to tell you the words and the
wondrous doings of Him who sent us; and instead of logical
demonstration, we present to you many witnesses from amongst yourselves
who stand by, whose faces I remember, as living images.  These
sufficient testimonies it is left to your choice to submit to, or to
disbelieve. <span id="fr_905"></span>[906](#fn_905.md)   But I shall not
cease to declare unto you what is for your profit; for to be silent were
to me a loss, and to disbelieve is ruin to you.  But indeed I could give
answers to your frivolous questions, if you asked them through love of
truth.  But the reason of the different structure of the gnat and
elephant it is not fitting to tell to those who are ignorant of the God
of all.”

<span id="vi.iv.iv.x-p3"></span> We have here adopted a conjectural
reading of Davis.  The common text is thus translated:  “whose faces I
remember, and who as being living images are satisfactory testimonies. 
These it is left,” etc.
