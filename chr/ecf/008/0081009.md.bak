id="vi.iv.xvi.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.—The Mother Must Not Take Food
with Her Son.  The Reason Stated.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xvi.iv-p2"></span>As soon as my mother had enough of
sleep, she awoke, and Peter at once began first to talk to her of *true*
piety, saying:  “I wish you to know, O woman, the course of life
involved in our religion. <span id="fr_1161"></span>[1162](#fn_1161.md)  
We worship one God, who made the world which you see; and we keep His
law, which has for its chief injunctions to worship Him alone, and to
hallow His name, and to honour our parents, and to be chaste, and to
live piously.  In addition to this, we do not live with all
indiscriminately; nor do we take our food from the same table as
Gentiles, inasmuch as we cannot eat along with them, because they live
impurely.  But when we have persuaded them to have true thoughts, and to
follow a right course of action, and have baptized them with a thrice
blessed invocation, then we dwell with them.  For not even if it were
our father, or mother, or wife, or child, or brother, or <span

other one having a claim by nature on our affection, can we venture to
take our meals with him; for our religion compels us to make a
distinction.  Do not, therefore, regard it as an insult if your son does
not take his food along with you, until you come to have the same
opinions and adopt the same course of conduct as he follows.”
