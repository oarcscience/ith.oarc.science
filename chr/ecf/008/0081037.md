id="vi.iv.xvii.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter X.—Faustus Explains His Narrative
to Peter.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xvii.x-p2"></span>Peter seeing this, said:  “Are you
Faustus, the husband of this woman, and the father of her children?” 
And he said:  “I am.”  And Peter said:  “How, then, did you relate to me
your own history as if it were another’s; telling <span id="page_308">p.
308</span> <span id="vi.iv.xvii.x-Page_308"></span>me of your toils, and
sorrow, and burial?”  And our father answered:  “Being of the family of
Cæsar, and not wishing to be discovered, I devised the narrative in
another’s name, in order that it might not be perceived who I was.  For
I knew that, if I were recognised, the governors in the place would
learn this, and recall me to gratify Cæsar, and would bestow upon me
that former prosperity to which I had formerly bidden adieu with all the
resolution I could summon.  For I could not give myself up to a
luxurious life when I had pronounced the strongest condemnation on
myself, because I believed that I had been the cause of death to those
who were loved by me.” <span id="fr_1211"></span>[1212](#fn_1211.md)

<span id="vi.iv.xvii.x-p3"></span> Lit., “Having judged the greatest
things in regard to those who were loved by me, as having died.”  The
text is doubtful; for the first *Epitome* has something quite different.
