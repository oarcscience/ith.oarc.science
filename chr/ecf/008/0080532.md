Polytheism.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.xii.xxiv-p2"></span>“But also the sepulchres of his
sons, who are regarded amongst these *the Gentiles* as gods, are openly
pointed out, one in one place, and another in another:  that of Mercury
at Hermopolis; that of the Cyprian Venus at Cyprus; that of Mars in
Thrace; that of Bacchus at Thebes, where he is said to have been torn in
pieces; that of Hercules at Tyre, where he was burnt with fire; that of
Æsculapius in Epidaurus.  And all these are spoken of, not only as men
who have died, but as wicked men who have been punished for their
crimes; and yet they are adored as gods by foolish men. <span
