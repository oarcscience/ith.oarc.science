id="vi.iv.v.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—Test of Truth.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.v.viii-p2"></span>“And it is by no means that which is
true, but that which is pleasing, which persuades every one who seeks to
learn from himself.  Since, therefore, one thing is pleasing to one, and
another to another, one thing prevails over one as truth, and another
thing over another.  But the truth is that which is approved by the
Prophet, not that which is pleasant to each individual.  For that which
is one would be many, if the pleasing were the true; which is
impossible.  Wherefore also the Grecian philologers—rather than
philosophers <span id="fr_920"></span>[921](#fn_920.md) —going about
matters by conjectures, have dogmatized much and diversely, thinking
that the apt sequence of hypotheses is truth, not knowing that when they
have assigned to themselves false beginnings, their conclusion has
corresponded with the beginning.
