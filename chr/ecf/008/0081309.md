<span id="vii.xv.ix-p2"></span>And certain others, a multitude of men
and women, cried out, saying:  That man is a prophet, and the demons are
subject to him.  Pilate says to those who said the demons are subject to
him:  And your masters, why are they not subject to him?  They say to
Pilate:  We do not know.  And others said to Pilate:  He raised up dead
Lazarus from the tomb after four days.  The governor, hearing this, said
trembling to all the multitude of the Jews:  Why do you wish to shed
innocent blood?
