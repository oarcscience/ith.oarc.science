id="vi.iii.v.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVI.—Existence of Evil.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.v.vi-p2"></span>Then Peter said:  “If you truly wish to
learn, then first learn this, how unskilfully you have framed your
question; for you say, Since God has created all things, whence is
evil?  But before you asked this, three sorts of questions should have
had the precedence:  *First*, Whether there be evil?  *Secondly*, What
evil is?  *Thirdly*, To whom it is, and whence?”  To this Simon
answered:  “Oh thou most unskilful and unlearned, is there any man who
does not confess that there is evil in this life?  Whence I also,
thinking that you had even the common sense of all men, asked, whence
evil is; not as wishing to learn, since I know all things, least of all
from you, who know nothing, but that I might show you to be ignorant of
all things.  And that you may not suppose that it is because I am angry
that I speak somewhat sternly, know that I am moved with compassion for
those who are present, whom you are attempting to deceive.”  Then Peter
said:  “The more wicked are you, if you can do such wrong, not being
angry; but smoke must rise where there is fire.  Nevertheless I shall
tell you, lest I should seem to take you up with words, so as not to
answer to those things which you have spoken disorderly.  You say that
all confess the existence of evil, which is verily false; for, first of
all, the whole Hebrew nation deny its existence.”
