<span id="vi.iii.vi.iii-p2"></span>Thereupon Peter was greatly
delighted, and praised the brethren, and blessed them, and requested
them to remain with him.  Then, when he had bathed in the sea, and had
taken food, he went to sleep in the evening; and rising, as usual, at
cock-crow, while the evening light was still burning, he found us all
awake.  Now there were in all sixteen of us, viz. Peter and I, Clement,
Niceta and Aquila, and those twelve who had preceded us. <span
id="fr_719"></span>[720](#fn_719)   Saluting us, then, as was his wont,
Peter said:  “Since we are not taken up with others to-day, let us be
taken up with ourselves.  I shall tell you what took place at Cæsarea
after your departure, and you shall tell us of the doings of Simon
here.”  And while the conversation was going on on these subjects, at
daybreak some of the members of the family came in and told Peter that
Simon, when he heard of Peter’s arrival, departed in the night, on the
way to Syria.  They also stated that the crowds thought that the day
which he had said was to intervene was a very long time for their
affection, and that they were standing in impatience before the gate,
conversing among themselves about those things which they wished to
hear, and that they hoped that they should by all means see him before
the time appointed; and that as the day became lighter the multitudes
were increasing, and that they were trusting confidently, whatever they
might be presuming upon, that they should hear a discourse from him. 
“Now then,” said they, “instruct us to tell them what seems good to you;
for it is absurd that so great a multitude should have come together,
and should depart with sadness, through no answer being returned to
them.  For they will not consider that it is they that have not waited
for the appointed day but rather they will think that you are slighting
them.”
