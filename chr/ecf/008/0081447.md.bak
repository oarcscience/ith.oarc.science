Documents.</span>

<span id="ix.ii-p4"></span> ————————————

<span id="ix.ii-p5"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="ix.ii-p5.1"></span>The</span> *Syriac Documents* here subjoined are
to be regarded as interesting relics of the primitive ages, but neither
wholly genuine nor in details authentic.  They have been interpolated
and corrupted so as to reflect, in some particulars, ideas wholly
repugnant to those of Christian antiquity, and which first received
currency in the period of the Iconoclastic controversy. <span
id="fr_2887"></span>[2888](#fn_2887.md)   Yet the pages of Eusebius bear
witness to the Edessene legends as of very early origin, and it is
reasonable to suppose that they rest on some inquiries made by the
contemporary Abgar concerning the great Prophet who had appeared in
Galilee.  The visit of the Wise Men from the East, and the history of
Naaman the Syrian, lend antecedent probability to the idea that such
inquiries may have been made.  The mission of Thaddæus seems a
historical fact; and if he found Abgar predisposed to believe, and
familiar with the story of the Christ, the growth of the whole fable is
sufficiently accounted for.  Let me quote Wake in the Preliminary
Discourse to his *Apostolic Fathers*.  He says: <span
id="fr_2888"></span>[2889](#fn_2888.md)   “That both the intercourse
reported by Eusebius between our Saviour and this prince (Abgarus), and
the report of the picture being brought to him, have been received as a
matter of unquestionable truth in those parts, the authority of
Gregorius Abulpharagius <span id="fr_2889"></span>[2890](#fn_2889.md) will
not suffer us to doubt.…But Gelasius <span
id="fr_2890"></span>[2891](#fn_2890.md) pronounced the epistle of our
Saviour to be apocryphal.…Natalis Alexander judges both it and the reply
of Abgar *supposititious*; and Dupin, after him, yet more solidly
convicts it of such manifest errors as may satisfy all considering
persons that Eusebius and Ephraem were too easy of belief in this
particular, and did not sufficiently examine into it.” <span
id="fr_2891"></span>[2892](#fn_2891.md)

<span id="ix.ii-p11"></span>But I cannot do better than refer the
inquirer to Jones’ work *On the Canon*, <span
id="fr_2892"></span>[2893](#fn_2892.md) where, even in early youth, I found
the whole matter, and the story of the portrait of our Saviour,
attractive reading.  I owe to that work my initiation into the study of
what I am now endeavouring to elucidate, in some degree, for others.  I
subjoin the words of Lardner, <span id="fr_2893"></span>[2894](#fn_2893.md)
in concluding his candid examination of the matter, as follows:  “The
whole history is the fiction of some Christian at Edessa, in the time of
Eusebius or not long before.  The people of Edessa were then generally
Christians; and they valued themselves upon it, and were willing to do
themselves the honour of a very early conversion to the Christian
faith.  By some one of them, or more united together, this history was
formed, *and was so far* received by Eusebius as to be thought by him
*not improper* to be inserted in his *Ecclesiastical History*.”

<span id="ix.ii-p14"></span>I conclude that Eusebius was led to put some
confidence in it by the *antecedent probability* to <span
id="page_648">p. 648</span> <span id="ix.ii-Page_648"></span>which I
have referred, favouring the idea that some knowledge of Christ had
penetrated the mind and heart of Abgar even in our Saviour’s lifetime. 
This idea receives some countenance from the fact recorded by St.
Matthew: <span id="fr_2894"></span>[2895](#fn_2894.md)   “His fame went
*throughout all Syria*; and they brought unto Him all sick people that
were taken with divers diseases,” etc.

<span id="ix.ii-p16"></span>The remarks I have quoted from the learned
will sufficiently prepare the reader for the other *Syriac Documents*
which follow these *Edessene Memoirs*, as I find it convenient to call
them.

<span id="ix.ii-p17"></span>Here follows the <span class="c9"><span
id="ix.ii-p17.1"></span>Introductory Notice</span> by the translator:—

<span id="ix.ii-p18"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="ix.ii-p18.1"></span>These</span> Documents were selected by the late
Dr. Cureton, from manuscripts acquired by the British Museum from the
Nitrian Monastery in Lower Egypt, of which the first portion arrived in
1841, the second in 1843, and a third in 1847.  The preparation of them
for publication occupied the closing days of his life.  It is to be
regretted that his death occurred before he was able to write a
preface:  the more so because, to use the words of Dr. W. Wright, the
editor of the posthumous work, “he had studied the questions connected
with this volume for years and from every point of view.”  In a note
occurring in the preface to his *Festal Letters of Athanasius*, <span
id="fr_2895"></span>[2896](#fn_2895.md) he says:  “I have found among the
Syriac <span class="c9"><span id="ix.ii-p19.1"></span>mss.</span> in the
British Museum a considerable portion of the original Aramaic document
which Eusebius cites as preserved in the archives of Edessa, and various
passages from it quoted by several authors, with other testimonies which
seem to be sufficient to establish the fact of the early conversion of
the inhabitants of that city, and among them of the king himself,
although his successors afterwards relapsed into paganism.  These,
together with accounts of the martyrdom of some of the first bishops of
that city, forming a most interesting accession to our knowledge of the
early propagation of Christianity in the East down to about <span
class="c9"><span id="ix.ii-p19.2"></span>a.d.</span> 300, I have already
transcribed, and hope to publish.”  “He was himself firmly persuaded,”
adds Dr. Wright, “of the genuineness of the Epistles attributed to
Abgar, king of Edessa, and our Lord:  an opinion which he shared with
such illustrious scholars as Baronius, Tillemont, Cave, R. Mountague
(Bishop of Norwich), and Grabe.”

<span id="ix.ii-p20"></span>Without attempting here to decide what
degree of historical value belongs to these Documents, it may be proper
to observe that the several matters contained in them are so far
distinct from one another that they do not necessarily stand or fall
together.  Such matters are:  the celebrated Epistles, the conversion of
King Abgar Uchomo, the visit of Thaddæus, and the early prevalence of
Christianity at Edessa.  With regard to the letters said to have passed
between Abgar and our Lord, it seems sufficient, without referring to
the internal evidence, to remark, with Lardner and Neander, that it is
inconceivable how anything written by Christ should have remained down
to the time of Eusebius unknown to the rest of the world <span
id="fr_2896"></span>[2897](#fn_2896.md)   The conversion of Abgar is a
distinct matter of inquiry.  But on this again, doubt, to say the least,
is cast by the statement that Abgar Bar Manu, who reigned between the
years 160 and 170 <span class="c9"><span
id="ix.ii-p21.1"></span>a.d.</span>, is the first king of Edessa on
whose coins the usual symbols of the Baal-worship of the country are
wanting, these being replaced in his case by the sign of the
Cross. <span id="fr_2897"></span>[2898](#fn_2897.md)   If this refers to a
complete series of the coins of Edessa, the evidence afforded must be
considered very strong.  For although, to take a parallel instance, “we
seek in vain for Christian emblems on the coinage of Constantine, the
first Christian emperor,” <span id="fr_2898"></span>[2899](#fn_2898.md)
this may readily be accounted for by his preference of military
distinction to the humbler honours conferred by his new faith, whilst it
does not appear that *anti*-Christian emblems are found, and on the
coins of his son and successor Christian emblems do make their
appearance.  The other two subjects referred to do not lie under the
same suspicion.  There is nothing in the nature of the case to disprove
the visit of Thaddæus (or Addæus)—nothing improbable in the fact itself,
whatever judgment may be formed of the details of it presented to us
here.  If, however, the visit of Thaddæus also should have to be ranked
among apocryphal stories, this would not affect the <span
id="page_649">p. 649</span> <span id="ix.ii-Page_649"></span>remaining
point—that with which we are chiefly concerned in these Documents.  “It
is certain,” says Neander, “that Christianity was early diffused in this
country.”  How early, is not so certain.  But the evidence furnished by
the later portions of these Documents, which there is nothing to
contradict and much to confirm, proves that early in the second century
Christianity had already made many converts there.  The martyrdoms of
Sharbil and Barsamya are said to have occurred <span class="c9"><span
id="ix.ii-p23.1"></span>a.d.</span> 113, <span
id="fr_2899"></span>[2900](#fn_2899.md) the year in which Trajan conquered
the Parthian kingdom, of which Edessa was a part; and, whilst the pagan
element was plainly predominant, we find the Christians sufficiently
numerous to have a bishop and presbyters and deacons.  This sufficiently
falls in with the proof already adduced of the conversion of even a king
of Edessa about fifty years later.

<span id="ix.ii-p25"></span>To the Documents which are presumably of the
ante-Nicene age, Dr. Cureton added two Metrical Homilies by Jacob of
Serug, who lived in the next century.  But, as they are so closely
connected with the most interesting portions of the rest, the
martyrdoms, and are besides of considerable merit as compositions, the
decision of the editors to insert them will, it is presumed, be approved
by most readers.  The two supplemental portions, one from the Latin of
Simeon Metaphrastes, and the other from Le Vaillant de Florival’s French
translation of Moses of Chorene, have also been inserted.

<span id="ix.ii-p26"></span>The translation of the Syriac portions,
although made with Dr. Cureton’s version constantly in sight, may fairly
be considered as independent.  The only matter in which his authority
has been relied on is—in the case of proper names, the supply of the
necessary vowels,—for the text is vowelless.  And even to this, one
exception occurs, in the *Martyrdom of Barsamya*, where “Evaristus” has
been adopted instead of his “Erastus.”  In regard to the sense, it has
been frequently found necessary to differ from him, while a style
somewhat freer, though, it is hoped, not less faithful, has been
employed.  The Metrical Homilies also have been arranged so as to
present the appearance of poetry.  The results of Dr. Wright’s collation
of the text with the <span class="c9"><span
id="ix.ii-p26.1"></span>mss.</span> have also contributed to the greater
correctness of the work.

<span id="ix.ii-p27"></span>The translator desires very thankfully to
acknowledge his obligations to Dr. R. Payne Smith, Regius Professor of
Divinity in the University of Oxford, <span
id="fr_2900"></span>[2901](#fn_2900.md) the progress of whose *Thesaurus
Syriacus* is regarded with so much satisfaction and hope, for his
kindness in furnishing much valuable information respecting matters on
which the lexicons are silent.

<span id="ix.ii-p29"></span>The notes marked <span class="c9"><span
id="ix.ii-p29.1"></span>Tr</span>. are by the translator.  The others,
where the contrary is not indicated, are, at least in substance, Dr.
Cureton’s:  though their citation does not always imply approval. <span
