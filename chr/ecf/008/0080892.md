id="vi.iv.xii.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter IX.—How Demons Get Power Over
Men.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xii.ix-p2"></span>“Since, on the other hand, you are
oppressed by strange sufferings inflicted by demons, on your removal
from the body you shall have your souls also punished for ever; not
indeed by God’s inflicting vengeance, but because such is the judgment
of evil deeds.  For the demons, having power by means of the food given
to them, are admitted into your bodies by your own hands; and lying hid
there for a long time, they become blended with your souls.  And through
the carelessness of those who think not, or even wish not, to help
themselves, upon the dissolution of their bodies, their souls being
united to the demon, are of necessity borne by it into whatever places
it pleases.  And what is most terrible of all, when at the end of all
things the demon is first consigned to the purifying fire, the soul
which is mixed with it is under the necessity of being horribly
punished, and the demon of being pleased.  For the soul, being made of
light, and not capable of bearing the heterogeneous flame of fire, is
tortured; but the demon, being in the substance of his own kind, is
greatly pleased, becoming the strong chain of the soul that he has
swallowed up.
