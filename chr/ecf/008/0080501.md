id="vi.iii.xi.xxxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXII.—Stubborn Facts.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.xi.xxxii-p2"></span>“Now, old man, if you have any
thing to say in answer to these things, say on.”  Then said the old
man: <span id="fr_850"></span>[851](#fn_850.md)   “You have most fully
argued, my son; but I, as I said at first, am prevented by my own
consciousness from according assent to all this incomparable statement
of yours.  For I know both my own <span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iii.xi.xxxii-p3.1"></span>Genesis</span> and that of my wife, and
I know that those things have happened which our <span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iii.xi.xxxii-p3.2"></span>Genesis</span> prescribed to each of
us; and I cannot now be withdrawn by words from those things which I
have ascertained by facts and deeds.  In short, since I perceive that
you are excellently skilled in this sort of learning, hear the horoscope
of my wife, and you shall find the configuration whose issue has
occurred.  For she had Mars with Venus above the centre, and the Moon
setting in the houses of Mars and the confines of Saturn.  Now this
configuration leads women to be adulteresses, and to love their own
slaves, and to end their days in foreign travel and in waters.  And this
has so come to pass.  For she fell in love with her slave, and fearing
at once danger and reproach, she fled with him, and going abroad, where
she satisfied her love, she perished in the sea.”
