<span id="vi.iv.xxi.xviii-p2"></span>“From the circumstance that Isaiah
said, in the person of God, <span id="fr_1395"></span>[1396](#fn_1395.md)
‘But Israel hath not known me, and the people hath not understood me,’
it is not to be inferred that Isaiah indicated another God besides Him
who is known; <span id="fr_1396"></span>[1397](#fn_1396.md) but he meant
that the known God was in another sense unknown, because the people
sinned, being ignorant of the just character of the known God, and
imagined that they would not be punished by the good God.  Wherefore,
after he said, ‘But Israel hath not known me, and the people hath not
understood me,’ he adds, ‘Alas! a sinful nation, a people laden with
sins.’  For, not being afraid, in consequence of their ignorance of His
justice, as I said, they became laden with sins, supposing that He was
merely good, and would not therefore punish them for their sins.
