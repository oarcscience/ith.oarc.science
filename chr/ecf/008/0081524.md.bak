<span id="x.x-p1"></span> <span class="c6"><span
id="x.x-p1.1"></span>Claudius Apollinaris, <span
id="fr_3754"></span>[3755](#fn_3754.md) Bishop of Hierapolis, and
Apologist.</span>

<span id="x.x-p3"></span>\[<span class="c9"><span
id="x.x-p3.1"></span>a.d.</span> 160–180.\]  This author, an early
apologist, is chiefly interesting as a competent witness, who tells the
story of the *Thundering Legion* <span
id="fr_3755"></span>[3756](#fn_3755.md) in an artless manner, and gives it
the simple character of an answer to prayer.  This subject is treated by
Lightfoot, in his recent work on the *Apostolic Fathers*, <span
id="fr_3756"></span>[3757](#fn_3756.md) in an exhaustive manner; and the
story, reduced to the simple narrative as Apollinaris gives it, receives
from him a just and discriminating approval.

<span id="x.x-p6"></span>Apollinaris, as well as Rhodon, has been
imagined the author of the work (ascribed to Asterius Urbanus) against
Montanism, dedicated to Abiricius Marcellus. <span
id="fr_3757"></span>[3758](#fn_3757.md)   This is sufficiently refuted by
Routh, <span id="fr_3758"></span>[3759](#fn_3758.md) whose Greek text, with
notes, must be consulted by the studious. <span
id="fr_3759"></span>[3760](#fn_3759.md)

<span id="x.x-p10"></span>Apollinaris was bishop of Hierapolis on the
Mæander, and, Lightfoot thinks, was probably with Melito and Polycrates,
known to Polycarp, and influenced by his example and doctrine. <span
id="fr_3760"></span>[3761](#fn_3760.md)   He addressed his *Apology*, which
is honourably mentioned by Jerome, to M. Antoninus, the emperor.  He
also wrote *Adversus Gentes* and *De Veritate;* also against the Jews. 
Serapion calls him <span id="fr_3761"></span>[3762](#fn_3761.md) “most
blessed.”

<span id="x.x-p13"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="x.x-p13.1"></span>From an Unknown Book. <span
id="fr_3762"></span>[3763](#fn_3762.md) </span>

<span id="x.x-p15"></span>“<span class="c9"><span
id="x.x-p15.1"></span>This</span> narration (says Eusebius, *Hist*., v.
5) is given” (it relates to that storm of rain which was sent to the
army of the Emperor M. Antoninus, to allay the thirst of the soldiers,
whilst the enemy was discomfited by thunderbolts hurled upon them) “even
by those historians who are at a wide remove from the doctrines that
prevail among us, and who have been simply concerned to describe what
related to *the emperors who are* the subjects of their history; and it
has been recorded also by our own writers.  But historians without *the
pale of the Church*, as being unfriendly to the faith, while they have
recorded the prodigy, have refrained from acknowledging that it was sent
in answer to our prayers.  On the other hand, our writers, as lovers of
truth, have reported the matter in a simple and artless way.  To this
number Apollinaris must be considered as belonging.  ‘Thereupon,’ he
says, ‘the legion which had by its prayer caused the prodigy received
from the emperor a title suitable to the occurrence, and was called in
the Roman language the Thunder-hurling *Legion*.’”

<span id="x.x-p16"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="x.x-p16.1"></span>From the Book Concerning the Passover. <span
id="fr_3763"></span>[3764](#fn_3763.md) </span>

<span id="x.x-p18"></span>There are, then, some who through ignorance
raise disputes about these things (though their conduct is pardonable: 
for ignorance is no subject for blame—it rather needs further
instruction), and say that on the fourteenth day the Lord ate the lamb
with the disciples, and that on the great day of the *feast of*
unleavened bread He Himself suffered; and they quote Matthew as speaking
in accordance with their view.  Wherefore their opinion is contrary to
the law, and the Gospels seem to be at variance with them. <span
id="fr_3764"></span>[3765](#fn_3764.md)

<span id="x.x-p20"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="x.x-p20.1"></span>From the Same Book.</span>

<span id="x.x-p21"></span>The fourteenth day, the true Passover of the
Lord; the great sacrifice, the Son of God instead <span id="page_773">p.
773</span> <span id="x.x-Page_773"></span>of the lamb, who was bound,
who bound the strong, and who was judged, *though* Judge of living and
dead, and who was delivered into the hands of sinners to be crucified,
who was lifted up on the horns of the unicorn, and who was pierced in
His holy side, who poured forth from His side the two purifying
elements, <span id="fr_3765"></span>[3766](#fn_3765.md) water and blood,
word and spirit, and who was buried on the day of the passover, the
stone being placed upon the tomb.
