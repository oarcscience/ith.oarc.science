<span id="viii.iv.ii.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span

<span id="viii.iv.ii.vii-p2"></span>(As to whether a priest may minister
after a lapse.)

<span id="viii.iv.ii.vii-p3"></span>For those are in error who think
that the priests of the Lord, after a lapse, although they may have
exhibited true repentance, are not capable of ministering to the Lord,
and engaging their honourable offices, though they may lead a good life
thereafter, and keep their priesthood correctly.  And those who hold
this opinion are not only in error, but also seem to dispute and act in
opposition to *the power of* the keys committed to the Church, whereof
it is said:  “Whatsoever ye shall loose on earth, shall be loosed in
heaven.” <span id="fr_2746"></span>[2747](#fn_2746.md)   And in short, this
opinion either is not the Lord’s, or it is true.  But *be that as it
may*, we believe without hesitation, that both the priests of the Lord
and other believers may return to their honours after a proper
satisfaction for their error, as the Lord Himself testifies by His
prophet:  “Shall he who falls not also rise again? and shall he who
turns away not return?” <span id="fr_2747"></span>[2748](#fn_2747.md)   And
in another passage the Lord says:  “I desire not the death of the
sinner, but that he may turn, and live.” <span
id="fr_2748"></span>[2749](#fn_2748.md)   And the prophet David, on his
repentance, said:  “Restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation, and uphold
me with Thy free Spirit.” <span id="fr_2749"></span>[2750](#fn_2749.md)  
And he indeed, after his repentance, taught others also, and offered
sacrifice to God, giving thereby an example to the teachers of the holy
Church, that if they have fallen, and thereafter have exhibited a right
repentance to God, they may do both things in like manner.  For he
taught when he said:  “I will teach transgressors Thy ways, and sinners
shall be converted unto Thee.” <span
id="fr_2750"></span>[2751](#fn_2750.md)   And he offered sacrifice for
himself, while he said:  “The sacrifice for God is a broken
spirit.” <span id="fr_2751"></span>[2752](#fn_2751.md)   For the prophet,
seeing his own transgressions purged by repentance, had no doubt as
<span id="page_618">p. 618</span> <span
id="viii.iv.ii.vii-Page_618"></span>to healing those of others by
preaching, and by making offering to God.  Thus the shedding of tears
moves the mind’s feeling (*passionem*).  And when the satisfaction is
made good, the mind is turned aside from anger.  For how does that man
think that mercy will be shown to himself, who does not forgive his
neighbour?  If offences abound, then, let mercy also abound; for with
the Lord there is mercy, and with Him is plenteous redemption. <span
id="fr_2752"></span>[2753](#fn_2752.md)   In the Lord’s hand there is
abundance of all things, because He is the Lord of powers (*virtutum*)
and the King of glory. <span id="fr_2753"></span>[2754](#fn_2753.md)   For
the apostle says:  “All have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;
being justified freely by His grace, through the redemption that is in
Jesus Christ:  whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through
faith in His blood, to declare His righteousness for the remission of
sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; to declare, ‘I say,’
at this time His righteousness, that He might be just, and the justifier
of him which believeth in Jesus.” <span
id="fr_2754"></span>[2755](#fn_2754.md)   And David says:  “Blessed are
they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.” <span
id="fr_2755"></span>[2756](#fn_2755.md)   Man, therefore, is cleansed of
his sin, and rises again by the grace of God though he has fallen, and
abides in his first position, according to the above-cited authorities. 
Let him see to it that he sin no more, that the sentence of the Gospel
may abide in him:  “Go, and sin no more.” <span
id="fr_2756"></span>[2757](#fn_2756.md)   Whence the apostle says:  “Let
not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey the
lusts thereof:  neither yield ye your members as instruments of
unrighteousness unto sin:  but yield yourselves unto God, as those that
are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of
righteousness unto God.  For sin shall not have dominion over you:  for
ye are not under the law, but under grace.  What then? shall we sin
because we are not under the law, but under grace?  God forbid.  Know ye
not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye
are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto
righteousness?  But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin;
but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was
delivered you.  Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of
righteousness.  I speak after the manner of men.” <span
id="fr_2757"></span>[2758](#fn_2757.md)   For greater is the sin of him who
judgeth, than of him who is judged.  “Thinkest thou,” says the apostle,
“O man, that judgest them that do such things, and doest the same, that
thou shalt escape the judgment of God? or despisest thou the riches of
His goodness, and forbearance, and long-suffering?  Dost thou not know
that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?  But, after thy
hardness and impenitent heart, thou treasurest up unto thyself wrath
against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of
God; who will render to every man according to his deeds:  to them who,
by patient continuance in well-doing, seek for glory, and honour, and
immortality, eternal life; but unto them that are contentious, and do
not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,
tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the
Jew first, and *also* of the Greek:  but glory, honour, and peace, to
every man that worketh good.” <span id="fr_2758"></span>[2759](#fn_2758.md)
  My brethren, shun not only the holding, but even the hearing, of the
judgment that bans mercy; for better is mercy than all whole
burnt-offerings and sacrifices. <span
id="fr_2759"></span>[2760](#fn_2759.md)   We have replied to your
interrogations shortly, because your letter found us burdened overmuch,
and preoccupied with other judgments.  Given on the 8th day of October,
in the consulship of the most illustrious Antonine and Alexander.” <span
