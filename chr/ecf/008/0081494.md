<span id="x.ii-p4"></span> ————————————

<span id="x.ii-p5"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="x.ii-p5.1"></span>Under</span> the title of *Fragments of the Second
and Third Centuries* are grouped together, in the Edinburgh series, a
mass of valuable illustrative material, which might have been
distributed with great advantage through the former volumes, in strict
order of chronology.  Something is due, however, to the unity of
authorship, and to the marked design of the editors of the original
edition to let these Fragments stand together, as the work of their
accomplished collaborator, the Rev. B. P. Pratten, with whose skill and
erudition our readers are already familiar. <span
id="fr_3528"></span>[3529](#fn_3528)

<span id="x.ii-p7"></span>I have contented myself, therefore, with
giving approximate order and continuity, on chronological grounds, to
the series of names subjoined.  Bardesanes has been eliminated here, and
placed more appropriately with the Syriac authors.  The reader will find
references which may aid him in seeking further information.  Some of
these names are of lasting value and interest in the Church.  I prefer
to call these “Fragments” their “Remains.”

<span id="x.ii-p8"></span>To each of the following names I have prefixed
some details of information, with such dates as the learned supply.

<span id="x.ii-p9"></span>The following is the

<span id="x.ii-p10"></span><span class="c62"><span
id="x.ii-p10.1"></span>Translator’s Introductory Notice</span>

<span id="x.ii-p11"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="x.ii-p11.1"></span>The</span> fragments that follow are the
productions of writers who lived during the second century or the
beginning of the third.  Little is known of the writers, and the
statements made in regard to them are often very indefinite, and the
result of mere conjecture.

<span id="x.ii-p12"></span>1.  Quadratus was one of the first of the
Christian apologists.  He is said to have presented his apology to
Hadrian while the emperor was in Athens attending the celebration of the
Eleusinian mysteries.

<span id="x.ii-p13"></span>2.  Aristo of Pella, a Jew, was the author of
a work called *The Disputation of Jason and Papiscus*.  Nothing further
is known of him.  He flourished in the first half of the second century.

<span id="x.ii-p14"></span>3.  Melito was bishop of Sardis, and
flourished in the reign of Marcus Aurelius.  He wrote many works, but
all of them have perished except a few fragments.  The genuineness of
the Syriac fragments is open to question.

<span id="x.ii-p15"></span>4.  Hegesippus also flourished in the time of
Antoninus Pius and Marcus Aurelius.  He is the first ecclesiastical
historian; but his book was rather notes for an ecclesiastical history,
than a history.

<span id="x.ii-p16"></span>5.  Dionysius was bishop of Corinth in the
reign of Marcus Aurelius.  He wrote letters to various churches.

<span id="x.ii-p17"></span><span id="page_748">p. 748</span> <span
id="x.ii-Page_748"></span>6.  Rhodon went from Asia to Rome, and became
a pupil of Tatian.  After the lapse of his master into heresy he
remained true to the faith, and wrote against heretics.

<span id="x.ii-p18"></span>7.  Maximus flourished about the same time as
Rhodon, under the emperors Commodus and Severus.

<span id="x.ii-p19"></span>8.  Claudius Apollinaris was bishop of
Hierapolis, and presented a defense of the Christians to Marcus
Aurelius.  He wrote many important works, of which we have only a few
fragments.

<span id="x.ii-p20"></span>9.  Polycrates was bishop of Ephesus.  He
took part in the controversy on the Passover question.  He died about
200 <span class="c9"><span id="x.ii-p20.1"></span>a.d.</span>

<span id="x.ii-p21"></span>10.  Theophilus was bishop of Cæsarea.  He
was a contemporary of Polycrates, and, like him, engaged in the Passover
controversy.

<span id="x.ii-p22"></span>11.  Serapion was ordained bishop of Antioch
<span class="c9"><span id="x.ii-p22.1"></span>a.d.</span> 190, but
almost no other fact of his life is known.  He wrote several works.

<span id="x.ii-p23"></span>12.  Apollonius wrote a work against the
Montanists, probably in the year <span class="c9"><span
id="x.ii-p23.1"></span>a.d.</span> 210.  This is all that is known of
him.

<span id="x.ii-p24"></span>13.  Pantænus, probably a Sicilian by birth,
passed from Stoicism to Christianity, and went to Judæa to proclaim the
truth.  He returned to Alexandria, and became president of the
catechetical school there, in which post he remained till his death,
which took place about the year 212 <span class="c9"><span
id="x.ii-p24.1"></span>a.d.</span>

<span id="x.ii-p25"></span>14.  *The Letter of the Churches in Vienne
and Lyons* was written shortly after the persecution in Gaul, which took
place in <span class="c9"><span id="x.ii-p25.1"></span>a.d.</span> 177. 
It is not known who is the author.  Some have supposed that Irenæus
wrote it, but there is no historical testimony to this effect.
