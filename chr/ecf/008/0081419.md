<span id="viii.v.viii-p2"></span>Of the imposition of the bishop’s hand.

<span id="viii.v.viii-p3"></span>For all the faithful ought to receive
the Holy Spirit after baptism by imposition of the hand of the bishops,
so that they may be found to be Christians fully; because when the Holy
Spirit is shed upon them, the believing heart is enlarged for prudence
and stedfastness.  We receive of the Holy Spirit in order that we may be
made spiritual; for the natural man receiveth not the things of the
Spirit of God. <span id="fr_2777"></span>[2778](#fn_2777)   We receive
of the Holy Spirit in order that we may be wise to discern between good
and evil, to love the just, and to loathe the unjust, so as to withstand
malice and pride, and resist luxury and divers allurements, and impure
and unworthy lust.  We receive of the Holy Spirit in order that, fired
with the love of life and the ardour of glory, we may be able to raise
our mind from things earthly to things heavenly and divine.—Given on the
Nones of September,—that is, on the fifth day of the same month, in the
consulship of the most illustrious Antonine and Alexander.
