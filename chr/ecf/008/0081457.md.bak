<span id="ix.v.vii-p2"></span>*From the homily composed by the holy Mar
Jacob, the teacher, on the fall of idols.* <span
id="fr_2954"></span>[2955](#fn_2954.md)

<span id="ix.v.vii-p4"></span>To Edessa he made his journey, and found
in it a great work:

<span id="ix.v.vii-p5"></span>For the king was become a labourer for the
church, and was building it.

<span id="ix.v.vii-p6"></span>The apostle Addæus stood in it like a
builder,

<span id="ix.v.vii-p7"></span>And King Abgar laid aside his diadem and
builded with him.

<span id="ix.v.vii-p8"></span>When apostle and king concurred the one
with the other,

<span id="ix.v.vii-p9"></span>What idol must not fall before them?

<span id="ix.v.vii-p10"></span>Satan fled to the land of Babylon from
the disciples,

<span id="ix.v.vii-p11"></span>And the tale of the crucifixion had got
before him to the country of the Chaldeans.

<span id="ix.v.vii-p12"></span>He said, when they were making sport of
the signs of the Zodiac, that he was nothing.
