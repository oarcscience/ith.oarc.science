<span id="vi.iii.xii.lxiii-p2"></span>Then said I:  “God arranges our
affairs to our liking; for we have with us Anubion an astrologer, with
whom, if we come to Antioch, we shall dispute with all earnestness on
the subject of <span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iii.xii.lxiii-p2.1"></span>Genesis</span>.”  And when our father
had set out, after the middle of the night, with those whom Peter had
ordered to accompany him, and with Anubion; in the morning, before Peter
went to the discussion, those men returned who had convoyed Simon,
namely Appion and Athenodorus, and came to us inquiring after my
father.  But Peter, when he was informed of their coming, ordered them
to enter.  And when they were seated, they asked, “Where is
Faustinianus?”  Peter answered:  “We do not know; for since the evening
that he went to you, no one of his friends has seen him.  But yesterday
morning Simon came inquiring for him; and because we gave him no answer,
I know not what he meant, but he said that he was Faustinianus.  But
when nobody believed him, he went and lamented, and threatened that he
would destroy himself; and afterwards he went away towards the sea.”
