id="vi.iv.xix.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVII.—The Nature of God.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xix.xvii-p2"></span>“We call Him God whose peculiar
attributes cannot belong to the nature of any other; for, as He is
called the Unbounded because He is boundless on every side, it must of
necessity be the case that it is no other one’s peculiar attribute to be
called unbounded, as another cannot in like manner be boundless.  But if
any one says that it is possible, he is wrong; for two things boundless
on every side cannot co-exist, for the one is bounded by the other. 
Thus it is in the nature <span id="fr_1302"></span>[1303](#fn_1302.md) of
things that the unbegotten is one.  But if he possesses a figure, even
in this case the figure is one and incomparable. <span
id="fr_1303"></span>[1304](#fn_1303.md)   Wherefore He is called the Most
High, because, being higher than all, He has the universe subject to
Him.”
