<span id="vi.iii.iv.xxxix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iii.iv.xxxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXIX.—Argument for
Polytheism.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iv.xxxix-p2"></span>Then Simon said:  “I shall make use
of assertions from the law of the Jews only.  For it is manifest to all
who take interest in religion, that this law is of universal authority,
yet that every one receives the understanding of this law according to
his own judgment.  For it has so been written by Him who created the
world, that the faith of things is made to depend upon it.  Whence,
whether any one wishes to bring forward truth, or any one to bring
forward falsehood, no assertion will be received without this law. 
Inasmuch, therefore, as my knowledge is most fully in accordance with
the law, I rightly declared that there are many gods, of whom one is
more eminent than the rest, and incomprehensible, even He who is God of
gods.  But that there are many gods, the law itself informs me.  For, in
the first place, *it says this in the passage* where one in the figure
of a serpent speaks to Eve, the first woman, ‘On the day ye eat of the
tree of the knowledge of good and evil, ye shall be as gods,’ <span
id="fr_630"></span>[631](#fn_630.md) that is, as those who made man; and
after they have tasted of the tree, God Himself testifies, saying to the
rest of the gods, ‘Behold, Adam is become as one of us;’ <span
id="fr_631"></span>[632](#fn_631.md) thus, therefore, it is manifest that
there were many gods engaged in the making of man.  Also, whereas at the
first God said to the other gods, ‘Let us make man after our image and
likeness;’ <span id="fr_632"></span>[633](#fn_632.md) also His saying, ‘Let
us drive him out;’ <span id="fr_633"></span>[634](#fn_633.md) and again,
‘Come, let us go down, and confound their language;’ <span
id="fr_634"></span>[635](#fn_634.md) all these things indicate that there
are many gods.  But this also is written, ‘Thou shalt not curse the
gods, nor curse the chief of thy people;’ <span
id="fr_635"></span>[636](#fn_635.md) and again this writing, ‘God alone led
them, and there was no strange god with them,’ <span
id="fr_636"></span>[637](#fn_636.md) shows that there are many gods.  There
are also many other testimonies which might be adduced from the law, not
only obscure, but plain, by which it is taught that there are many
gods. <span id="fr_637"></span>[638](#fn_637.md)   One of these was chosen
by lot, that he might be the god of the Jews.  But it is not of him that
I speak, but of that God who is also his God, whom even the Jews
themselves did not know.  For he is not their God, but the God of those
who know him.”
