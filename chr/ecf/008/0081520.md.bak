<span id="x.vi.ii.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="x.vi.ii.iv-p1.1"></span>Concerning His Journey to Rome, and the
Jewish Sects. <span id="fr_3703"></span>[3704](#fn_3703.md) </span>

<span id="x.vi.ii.iv-p3"></span>And the church of the Corinthians
continued in the orthodox faith <span
id="fr_3704"></span>[3705](#fn_3704.md) up to the time when Primus was
bishop in Corinth.  I had some intercourse with these *brethren* on my
voyage to Rome, when I spent several days with the Corinthians, during
which we were mutually refreshed by the orthodox faith.

<span id="x.vi.ii.iv-p5"></span>On my arrival at Rome, I drew up a list
of the succession *of bishops* down to Anicetus, whose deacon was
Eleutherus.  To Anicetus succeeded Soter, and after him *came*
Eleutherus.  But in the case of every succession, <span
id="fr_3705"></span>[3706](#fn_3705.md) and in every city, the state of
affairs is in accordance with the teaching of the Law and of the
Prophets and of the Lord.…

<span id="x.vi.ii.iv-p7"></span>And after James the Just had suffered
martyrdom, as had the Lord also *and* on the same account, again Symeon
the son of Clopas, descended from *the Lord’s* uncle, is made bishop,
his election being promoted by all as being a kinsman of the Lord.

<span id="x.vi.ii.iv-p8"></span>Therefore was the Church called a
virgin, for she was not as yet corrupted by worthless teaching. <span
id="fr_3706"></span>[3707](#fn_3706.md)   Thebulis it was who, *displeased*
because he was not made bishop, first began to corrupt her by stealth. 
He too was connected with the seven sects which existed among the
people, like Simon, from whom come the Simoniani; and Cleobius, from
whom come the Cleobiani; and Doritheus, from whom come the Dorithiani;
and Gorthæus, from whom come the Gortheani; Masbothæus, from whom come
the Masbothæi.  From these *men* also come the Menandrianists, and the
Marcionists, and the Carpocratians, and the Valentinians, and the
Basilidians, and the Saturnilians.  Each *of these leaders* in his own
private and distinct capacity brought in his own private opinion.  From
these have come false Christs, false prophets, false apostles—men who
have split up the one Church into parts <span
id="fr_3707"></span>[3708](#fn_3707.md) through their corrupting doctrines,
*uttered* in disparagement of God and of His Christ.…

<span id="x.vi.ii.iv-p11"></span>There were, moreover, various opinions
in the <span id="page_765">p. 765</span> <span
id="x.vi.ii.iv-Page_765"></span>matter of circumcision among the
children of Israel, held by those who were opposed to the tribe of Judah
and to Christ:  such as the Essenes, the Galileans, the Hemerobaptists,
the Masbothæi, the Samaritans, the Sadducees, the Pharisees.
