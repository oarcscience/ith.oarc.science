<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.iv.x-p2"></A>But while the multitudes were favourably disposed towards the things that he so artlessly spoke, the philosophers, impelled by their worldly learning, set upon laughing at him and making sport of him, upbraiding and reproaching him with excessive presumption, making use of the great armoury of syllogisms.&#160; But he set aside their babbling, and did not enter into their subtle questioning, but without embarrassment went on with what he was saying.&#160; And then one of them asked, Wherefore it was that a gnat, although it be so small, and has six feet, has wings also; while an elephant, the largest of beasts, is wingless, and has but four feet?&#160; But he, after the question had been put, resuming his discourse, which had been interrupted, as though he had answered the question, resumed his original discourse, only making use of this preface after each interruption:&#160; We have a commission only to tell you the words and the wondrous doings of Him who sent us; and instead of logical demonstration, we present to you many witnesses from amongst yourselves who stand by, whose faces I remember, as living images.&#160; These sufficient testimonies it is left to your choice to submit to, or to disbelieve.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_905"></A><A HREF="#fn_905"><FONT SIZE="1">906</FONT></A>
&#160; But I shall not cease to declare unto you what is for your profit; for to be silent were to me a loss, and to disbelieve is ruin to you.&#160; But indeed I could give answers to your frivolous questions, if you asked them through love of truth.&#160; But the reason of the different structure of the gnat and elephant it is not fitting to tell to those who are ignorant of the God of all.&#8221;</p>
