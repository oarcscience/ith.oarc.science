His Intercourse with the Other Sex, and Tells How in His Journeys He

<span id="v.iv.i-p3"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="v.iv.i-p3.1"></span>I would</span>, moreover, have you know, my
brethren, of what sort is our conduct in Christ, as well as that of all
our brethren, in the *various* places in which we are.  And if so be
that you approve it, do ye also conduct yourselves in like manner in the
Lord.  Now we, if God help us, conduct ourselves thus:  with maidens we
do not dwell, nor have we anything in common with them; with maidens we
do not eat, nor drink; and, where a maiden sleeps, we do not sleep;
neither do women wash our feet, nor anoint us; and on no account do we
sleep where a maiden sleeps who is unmarried or has taken the vow: <span
id="fr_432"></span>[433](#fn_432.md)   even though she be in some other
place *if she be* alone, we do not pass the night there. <span
id="fr_433"></span>[434](#fn_433.md)   Moreover, if it chance that the time
*for rest* overtake us in a place, whether in the country, or in a
village, or in a town, or in a hamlet, <span
id="fr_434"></span>[435](#fn_434.md) or wheresoever we happen to be, and
there are found brethren in that place, we turn in to one who is a
brother, and call together there all the brethren, and speak to them
words of encouragement and exhortation. <span
id="fr_435"></span>[436](#fn_435.md)   And those among us who are gifted in
speaking will speak such words as are earnest, and serious, and chaste,
in the fear of God, and *exhort them* to please God in everything, and
abound and go forward in good works, and “be free from <span
id="fr_436"></span>[437](#fn_436.md) anxious care in everything,” <span
id="fr_437"></span>[438](#fn_437.md) as is fit and right for the people of
God.

<span id="fn_432"></span>[61:433](0080040.htm#fr_432.md) <span
id="v.iv.i-p3.2"></span>

<span id="v.iv.i-p4"></span> *Lit*. “or *is* a daughter of the
covenant.”

<span id="fn_433"></span>[61:434](0080040.htm#fr_433.md) <span
id="v.iv.i-p4.1"></span>

<span id="v.iv.i-p5"></span> Beelen’s rendering, “we do not even pass
the night,” seems not to be favoured either by the arrangement or the
context.

<span id="fn_434"></span>[61:435](0080040.htm#fr_434.md) <span
id="v.iv.i-p5.1"></span>

<span id="v.iv.i-p6"></span> *Lit* “dwelling-place.”

<span id="fn_435"></span>[61:436](0080040.htm#fr_435.md) <span
id="v.iv.i-p6.1"></span>

<span id="v.iv.i-p7"></span> Or “consolation.”  So <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.iv.i-p7.1"></span>παράκλησις</span> in the
N.T. has both senses.

<span id="fn_436"></span>[61:437](0080040.htm#fr_436.md) <span
id="v.iv.i-p7.2"></span>

<span id="v.iv.i-p8"></span> *Lit*. “without.”
