<span id="vii.vi.vi-p2"></span>And when the circle of three years had
rolled round, and the time of her weaning was fulfilled, they brought
the virgin to the temple of the Lord with offerings.  Now there were
round the temple, according to the fifteen Psalms of Degrees, <span
id="fr_1695"></span>[1696](#fn_1695.md) fifteen steps going up; for, on
account of the temple having been built on a mountain, the altar of
burnt-offering, which stood outside, could not be reached except by
steps.  On one of these, then, her parents placed the little girl, the
blessed virgin Mary.  And when they were putting off the clothes which
they had worn on the journey, and were putting on, as was usual, others
that were neater and cleaner, the virgin of the Lord went up all the
steps, one after the other, without the help of any one leading her or
lifting her, in such a manner that, in this respect at least, you would
think that she had already attained full age.  For already the Lord in
the infancy of His virgin wrought a great thing, and by the indication
of this miracle foreshowed how great she was to be.  Therefore, a
sacrifice having been offered according to the custom of the law, and
their vow being perfected, they left the virgin within the enclosures of
the temple, there to be educated with the other virgins, and themselves
returned home.
