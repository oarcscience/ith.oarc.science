<span id="vi.iv.vi.xlviii-p2"></span>Then said Simon:  “Since, as you
say, we must understand the things concerning God by comparing them with
the creation, how is it possible to recognise the other things in the
law which are from the tradition of Moses, and are true, and are mixed
up with these falsehoods?”  Then Peter said:  “A certain verse has been
recorded without controversy in the written law, according to the
providence of God, so as to show clearly which of the things written are
true and which are false.”  Then said Simon:  “Which is that?  Show it
us.”
