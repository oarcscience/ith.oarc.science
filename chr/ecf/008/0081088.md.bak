<span id="vi.iv.xx.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.xx.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIV.—The Evidence of the Senses
More Trustworthy Than that of Supernatural Vision.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xx.xiv-p2"></span>And Peter said:  “You proposed to
speak to one point, you replied to another. <span
id="fr_1348"></span>[1349](#fn_1348.md)   For your proposition was, that
one is better able to know more fully, *and to attain confidence*, <span
id="fr_1349"></span>[1350](#fn_1349.md) when he hears in consequence of an
apparition, than when he hears with his own ears; but when you set about
the matter, you were for persuading us that he who hears through an
apparition is surer than he who hears with his own ears.  Finally, you
alleged that, on this account, you knew more satisfactorily the
doctrines of Jesus than I do, because you heard His words through an
apparition.  But I shall reply to the proposition you made at the
beginning.  The prophet, because he is a prophet, having first given
certain information with regard to what is objectively <span
id="fr_1350"></span>[1351](#fn_1350.md) said by him, is believed with
confidence; and being known beforehand to be a true prophet, and being
examined and questioned as the disciple wishes, he replies:  But he who
trusts to apparition or vision and dream is insecure.  For he does not
know to whom he is trusting.  For it is possible either that he may be
an evil demon or a deceptive spirit, pretending in his speeches to be
what he is not.  But if any one should wish to inquire of him who he is
who has appeared, he can say to himself whatever he likes.  And thus,
gleaming forth like a wicked one, and remaining as long as he likes, he
is at length extinguished, not remaining with the questioner so long as
he wished him to do for the purpose of consulting him.  For any one that
sees by means of dreams cannot inquire about whatever he may wish.  For
reflection is not in the special power of one who is asleep.  Hence we,
desiring to have information in regard to something in our waking hours,
inquire about something else in our dreams; or without inquiring, we
hear about matters that do not concern us, and awaking from sleep we are
dispirited because we have neither heard nor inquired about those
matters which we were eager to know.”
