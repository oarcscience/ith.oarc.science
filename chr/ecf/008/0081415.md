<span id="viii.v.iv-p2"></span>As to any one’s attempting to take from
the Church the right of holding property.

<span id="viii.v.iv-p3"></span>By the increase, therefore, and the mode
of life which have been mentioned, the churches over which the bishops
preside have grown so greatly with the help of the Lord, and the greater
part of them are now in possession of so much property, that among them
there is not a man who, selecting the life in common, is kept in
poverty; but such an one receives all necessaries from the bishop and
his ministers.  Therefore, if any one in modern or in future time shall
rise up and attempt to divert that property, let him be smitten with the
judgment which has been already mentioned.
