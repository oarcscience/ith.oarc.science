<span id="vi.ii-p5"></span> ————————————

<span id="vi.ii-p6"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vi.ii-p6.1"></span>The</span> name “Pseudo-Clementine Literature”
(or, more briefly, “Clementina”) is applied to a series of writings,
closely resembling each other, purporting to emanate from the great
Roman Father.  But, as Dr. Schaff remarks, in this literature he is
evidently confounded with “Flavius Clement, kinsman of the Emperor
Domitian.” <span id="fr_503"></span>[504](#fn_503.md)   These writings are
three in number:  (1) the *Recognitions*, of which only the Latin
translation of Rufinus has been preserved; <span
id="fr_504"></span>[505](#fn_504) (2.md) the *Homilies*, twenty in number,
of which a complete collection has been known since 1853; (3) the
*Epitome*, “an uninteresting extract from the *Homilies*, to which are
added extracts from the letter of Clement to James, from the *Martyrium*
of Clement by Simeon Metaphrastes, etc.” <span
id="fr_505"></span>[506](#fn_505.md)   Other writings may be classed with
these; but they are of the same general character, except that most of
them show the influence of a later age, adapting the material more
closely to the orthodox doctrine.

<span id="vi.ii-p10"></span>The *Recognitions* and the *Homilies* appear
in the pages which follow.  The former are given a prior position, as in
the Edinburgh series.  It probably cannot be proven that these represent
the earlier form of this theological romance; but the *Homilies*, “in
any case, present the more doctrinally developed and historically
important form of the other treatises, which are essentially
similar.” <span id="fr_506"></span>[507](#fn_506.md)   They are therefore
with propriety placed after the *Recognitions*, which do not seem to
have been based upon them, but upon some earlier document. <span
id="fr_507"></span>[508](#fn_507.md)

<span id="vi.ii-p13"></span>The critical discussion of the *Clementina*
has been keen, but has not reached its end.  It necessarily involves
other questions, about which there is still great difference of
opinion.  A few results seem to be established:—

<span id="vi.ii-p14"></span>(1)  The entire literature is of
Jewish-Christian, or Ebionitic, origin.  The position accorded to
“James, the Lord’s brother,” in all the writings, is a clear indication
of this; so is the silence respecting the Apostle Paul.  The doctrinal
statements, “though not perfectly homogeneous” (Uhlhorn), are Judaistic,
even when mixed with Gnostic speculation of heathen origin.  This
tendency is, perhaps, not so clearly marked in the *Recognitions* as in
the *Homilies*; but both partake largely of the same general character. 
More particularly, the literature has been connected with the Ebionite
sect called the Elkesaites; and some regard the *Homilies* as containing
a further development of their system. <span
id="fr_508"></span>[509](#fn_508.md)   This is not definitely established,
but finds some <span id="page_70">p. 70</span> <span
id="vi.ii-Page_70"></span>support in the resemblance between the
baptismal forms, as given by Hippolytus in the case of the
Elkesaites, <span id="fr_509"></span>[510](#fn_509.md) and those indicated
in the *Recognitions* and *Homilies*, especially the latter. <span
id="fr_510"></span>[511](#fn_510.md)

<span id="vi.ii-p18"></span>(2)  The entire literature belongs to the
class of fictitious writing “with a purpose.”  The Germans properly term
the *Homilies* a “Tendenz-Romance.”  The many “lives of Christ” written
in our day to insinuate some other view of our Lord’s person than that
given in the canonical Gospels, furnish abundant examples of the class. 
The Tübingen school, finding here a real specimen of the influence of
party feeling upon quasi-historical literature, naturally pressed the
*Clementina* in support of their theory of the origin of the Gospels.

<span id="vi.ii-p19"></span>(3)  The discussion leaves it quite
probable, though not yet certain, that all the works are “independent
elaborations—perhaps at first hand, perhaps at second or third—of some
older tract not now extant.” <span id="fr_511"></span>[512](#fn_511.md)  
Some of the opinions held respecting the relations of the two principal
works are given by the Edinburgh translator in his Introductory Notice. 
It is only necessary here to indicate the progress of the modern
discussion.  Neander, as early as 1818, gave some prominence to the
doctrinal view of the *Homilies*.  He was followed by Baur, who found in
these writings, as indicated above, support for his theory of the origin
of historical Christianity.  It is to be noted, however, that the
heterogeneous mixture of Ebionism and Gnosticism in the doctrinal views
proved perplexing to the leader of the Tübingen school. 
Schliemann <span id="fr_512"></span>[513](#fn_512.md) took ground against
Baur, collecting much material, and carefully investigating the
question.  Both authors give the priority to the *Homilies*.  While Baur
went too far in one direction, Schliemann, perhaps, failed to recognise
fully the basis of truth in the position of the former.  The next
important step in the discussion was made by Hilgenfeld, <span
id="fr_513"></span>[514](#fn_513.md) whose views are briefly given in the
Notice which follows.  Hilgenfeld assigned the priority to the
*Recognitions*, though he traced all the literature to an earlier work. 
Uhlhorn <span id="fr_514"></span>[515](#fn_514.md) at first attempted to
prove that the *Recognitions* were a revision of the *Homilies*. 
Further contributions were made by Lehmann <span
id="fr_515"></span>[516](#fn_515.md) and Lipsius. <span
id="fr_516"></span>[517](#fn_516.md)   The former discovered in the
*Recognitions* two distinct parts by different authors (i.–iii.,
iv.–ix.), tracing all the literature to the *Kerygma* of Peter.  The
latter finds the basis of the whole in the *Acta Petri*, which show a
strong anti-Pauline tendency.

<span id="vi.ii-p26"></span>Influenced by these investigations, Uhlhorn
modified his views.  Lechler, <span id="fr_517"></span>[518](#fn_517.md)
while not positive in his convictions, makes the following prudent
statement:  “An older work lies at the basis both of the *Homilies* and
*Recognitions*, bearing the title, *Kerygmen des Petrus*. <span
id="fr_518"></span>[519](#fn_518.md)   To this document sometimes the
*Homilies*, sometimes the *Recognitions*, correspond more faithfully;
its historical contents are more correctly seen from the *Recognitions*,
its doctrinal contents from the *Homilies*.”  Other views, some of them
quite fanciful, have been presented.

<span id="vi.ii-p29"></span>The prevalent opinion necessarily leaves us
in ignorance of the authors of this literature.  The date of
composition, or editing, cannot be definitely fixed.  In their present
form the several works may be as old as the first half of the third
century, and the common basis may be placed in the latter half of the
second century.

<span id="vi.ii-p30"></span>How far the anti-Pauline tendency is
carried, is a matter of dispute.  Baur and many others think Simon is
meant to represent Paul; <span id="fr_519"></span>[520](#fn_519.md) but
this is difficult to believe, though we must admit <span id="page_71">p.
71</span> <span id="vi.ii-Page_71"></span>the disposition to ignore the
Apostle to the Gentiles.  As to the literary merit of these productions
the reader must judge.

<span id="vi.ii-p32"></span>For convenience in comparison of the two
works, the following table has been prepared, based on the order of the
*Recognitions*.  The correspondences are not exact, and the reader is
referred to the footnotes for fuller details.  This table gives a
general view of the arrangement of the two narratives:—
