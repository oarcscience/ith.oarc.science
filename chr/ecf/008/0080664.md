id="vi.iv.v.xxxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXI.—A Dilemma.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.v.xxxi-p2"></span>Nicetas having thus spoken, Aquila
himself in turn said:  “This only should I wish to learn of you, Simon,
whether it is the soul or whether it is a demon that is conjured:  what
is it afraid of, that it does not despise the conjuration?  Then Simon
said:  ‘It knows that it should suffer punishment if it were
disobedient.’  Then said Aquila:  ‘Therefore, if the soul comes when
conjured, there is also a judgment.  If, therefore, souls are immortal,
assuredly there is also a judgment.  As you say, then, that those which
are conjured on wicked business are punished if they disobey, how are
you not afraid to compel them, when those that are compelled are
punished for disobedience?  For it is not wonderful that you do not
already suffer for your doings, seeing the judgment has not yet come,
when you are to suffer the penalty of those deeds which you have
compelled others to do, and when that which has been done under
compulsion shall be pardoned, as having been out of respect for the oath
which led to the evil action.’ <span id="fr_941"></span>[942](#fn_941.md)  
And he hearing this was enraged, and threatened death to us if we did
not keep silence as to his doings.”
