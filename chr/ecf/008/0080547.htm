<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.xii.xxxix-p2"></A>Then he answered:&#160; &#8220;Be sure, beloved Aquila, that all things are done by the good providence of God, that the cause which was to be contrary to the truth should not only be infirm and weak, but also base.&#160; For if the assertion of error had been stronger and more truth-like, any one who had been deceived by it would not easily return to the path of truth.&#160; If even now, when so many wicked and disgraceful things are related concerning the gods of the Gentiles, scarce any one forsakes the base error, how much more if there had been in it anything seemly and truth-like?&#160; For the mind is with difficulty transferred from those things with which it has been imbued in early youth; and on this account, as I said, it has been effected by divine providence, that the substance of error should be both weak and base.&#160; But all other things also divine providence dispenses fitly and advantageously, although the method of the divine dispensation, as good, and the best possible, is not clear to us who are ignorant of the causes of things.&#8221;</p>
