<span id="vi.iv.vi.lxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.vi.lxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter LXIV.—The Bishopric.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.vi.lxiv-p2"></span>Then Peter said:  “If you are afraid
of this, do not be called <span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iv.vi.lxiv-p2.1"></span>Ruler</span>, but <span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iv.vi.lxiv-p2.2"></span>The</span> <span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iv.vi.lxiv-p2.3"></span>Appointed</span> <span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iv.vi.lxiv-p2.4"></span>One</span>, the Lord having permitted you
to be so called, when He said, ‘Blessed is that man whom his Lord shall
<span class="c9"><span id="vi.iv.vi.lxiv-p2.5"></span>Appoint</span> to
the ministry of his fellow-servants.’ <span
id="fr_1025"></span>[1026](#fn_1025)   But if you wish it to be
altogether unknown that you have authority of administration, you seem
to me to be ignorant that the acknowledged authority of the president
has great influence as regards the respect of the multitude.  For every
one obeys him who has received authority, having conscience as a great
constraint.  And are you not well aware that you are not to rule as the
rulers of the nations, but as a servant ministering to them, as a father
to the oppressed, visiting them as a physician, guarding them as a
shepherd,—in short, taking all care for their salvation?  And do you
think that I am not aware what labours I compel you to undertake,
desiring you to be judged by multitudes whom it is impossible for any
one to please?  But it is most possible for him who does well to please
God.  Wherefore I entreat you to undertake it heartily, by God, by
Christ, for the salvation of the brethren, for their ordering, and your
own profit.
