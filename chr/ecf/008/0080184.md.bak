id="vi.iii.iv.xlvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLVII.—Simon’s Cavil.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iv.xlvii-p2"></span>To this Simon replied: <span
id="fr_657"></span>[658](#fn_657.md)   “From the words of your master I
shall refute you, because even he introduces to all men a certain God
who was known.  For although both Adam knew the God who was his creator,
and the maker of the world; and Enoch knew him, inasmuch as he was
translated by him; and Noah, since he was ordered by him to construct
the ark; and although Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and Moses, and all,
even every people and all nations, know the maker of the world, and
confess him to be a God, yet your Jesus, who appeared long after the
patriarchs, says:  ‘No one knows the Son, but the Father; neither
knoweth any one the Father, but the Son, and he to whom the Son has been
pleased to reveal Him.’ <span id="fr_658"></span>[659](#fn_658.md)   Thus,
therefore, even your Jesus confesses that there is another God,
incomprehensible and unknown to all.”
