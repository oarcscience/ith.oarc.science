id="vi.iii.iv.i-p1.1"></span>Chapter I.—Power of Habit.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iv.i-p2"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iii.iv.i-p2.1"></span>When</span> the day dawned which had been
fixed for the discussion with Simon, Peter, rising at the first
cock-crowing, aroused us also:  for we were sleeping in the same
apartment, thirteen of us in all; <span
id="fr_599"></span>[600](#fn_599.md) of whom, next to Peter, Zacchæus was
first, then Sophonius, Joseph and Michæas, Eliesdrus, Phineas, Lazarus,
and Elisæus:  after these I (Clement) and Nicodemus; then Niceta and
Aquila, who had formerly been disciples of Simon, and were converted to
the faith of Christ under the teaching of Zacchæus.  Of the women there
was no one present.  As the evening light <span
id="fr_600"></span>[601](#fn_600.md) was still lasting, we all sat down;
and Peter, seeing that we were awake, and that we were giving attention
to him, having saluted us, immediately began to speak, as follows:—

<span id="vi.iii.iv.i-p5"></span>“I confess, brethren, that I wonder at
the power of human nature, which I see to be fit and suited to every
call upon it.  This, however, it occurs to me to say of what I have
found by experience, that when the middle of the night is passed, I
awake of my own accord, and sleep does not come to me again.  This
happens to me for this reason, that I have formed the habit of recalling
to memory the words of my Lord, which I heard from Himself; and for the
longing I have towards them, I constrain my mind and my thoughts to be
roused, that, awaking to them, and recalling and arranging them one by
one, I may retain them in my memory.  From this, therefore, whilst I
desire to cherish the sayings of the Lord with all delight in my heart,
the habit of waking has come upon me, even if there be nothing that I
wish to think of.  Thus, in some unaccountable way, when any custom is
established, the old custom is changed, provided indeed you do not force
it above measure, but as far as the measure of nature admits.  For it is
not possible to be altogether without sleep; otherwise night would not
have been made for rest.”
