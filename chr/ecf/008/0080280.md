id="vi.iii.vi.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.—The Harvest Plenteous.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.vi.iv-p2"></span>Then Peter, filled with admiration,
said: <span id="fr_720"></span>[721](#fn_720)   “You see, brethren, how
every word of the Lord spoken prophetically is fulfilled.  For I
remember that He said, ‘The harvest indeed is plenteous, but the
labourers are few; ask therefore the Lord of the harvest, that He would
send out labourers into His harvest.’ <span
id="fr_721"></span>[722](#fn_721)   Behold, therefore, the things which
are foretold in a mystery are fulfilled.  But whereas He said also,
‘Many shall come from the east and the west, from the north and the
south, and shall recline in the bosom of Abraham, and Isaac, and
Jacob;’ <span id="fr_722"></span>[723](#fn_722) this also is, as you
see, in like manner fulfilled.  Wherefore I entreat you, my
fellow-servants and helpers, that you would learn diligently the order
of preaching, and the ways of absolutions, that ye may be able to save
the souls of men, which by the secret power of God acknowledge whom they
ought to love, even before they are taught.  For you see that these men,
like good servants, long for him whom they expect to announce to them
the coming of their Lord, that they may be able to fulfil His will when
they have learned it.  The desire, therefore, of hearing the word of
God, and inquiring into His will, they have from God; and this is the
beginning of the gift of God, which is given to the Gentiles, that by
this they may be able to receive the doctrine of truth.
