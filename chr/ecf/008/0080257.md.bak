Magicians.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.v.xlvii-p2"></span>Then said Niceta:  “In what respect
did the Egyptians sin in not believing Moses, since the magicians
wrought like signs, even although they were done rather in appearance
than in truth?  For if I had been there then, should I not have thought,
from the fact that the magicians did like things to those which Moses
did, either that Moses was a magician, or that the magicians wrought
their signs by divine commission?  For I should not have thought it
likely that the same things could be effected by magicians, even in
appearance, which he who was sent by God performed.  And now, in what
respect do they sin who believe Simon, since they see him do so great
marvels?  Or is it not marvellous to fly through the air, to be so mixed
with fire as to become one body with it, to make statues walk, brazen
dogs bark, and other such like things, which assuredly are sufficiently
wonderful to those who know not how to distinguish?  Yea, he has also
been seen to make bread of stones.  But if he sins who believes those
who do signs, how shall it appear that he also does not sin who has
believed our Lord for His signs and works of power?”
