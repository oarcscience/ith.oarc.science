<span id="vi.iv.v.xliv-p2"></span>“But if He desires the fruitful
hill, <span id="fr_949"></span>[950](#fn_949) whose then are all
things?  If He is false, who then is true?  If He dwells in a
tabernacle, who is without bounds?  If He is fond of fat, and
sacrifices, and offerings, and drink-offerings, who then is without
need, and who is holy, and pure, and perfect?  If He is pleased with
candles and candlesticks, who then placed the luminaries in heaven?  If
He dwells in shadow, and darkness, and storm, and smoke, who is the
light that lightens the universe?  If He comes with trumpets, and
shoutings, and darts, and arrows, who is the looked-for tranquillity of
all?  If He loves war, who then wishes peace?  If He makes evil things,
who makes good things?  If He is without affection, who is a lover of
men?  If He is not faithful to His promises, who shall be trusted?  If
He loves the wicked, and adulterers, and murderers, who shall be a just
judge?  If He changes His mind, who is stedfast?  If He chooses evil
men, who then takes the part of the good?
