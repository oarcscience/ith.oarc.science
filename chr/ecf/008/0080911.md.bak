<span id="vi.iv.xiii.iv-p2"></span>“While, therefore, he was righteous,
he was also superior to all sufferings, as being unable by his immortal
body to have any experience of pain; but when he sinned, as I showed you
yesterday and the day before, becoming as it were the servant of sin, he
became subject to all sufferings, being by a righteous judgment deprived
of all excellent things.  For it was not reasonable, the Giver having
been forsaken, that the gifts should remain with the ungrateful. 
Whence, of His abundant mercy, in order to our receiving, with the
first, also future blessings, He sent His Prophet.  And the Prophet has
given in charge to us to tell you what you ought to think, and what to
do.  Choose, therefore; and this is in your power.  What, therefore, you
ought to think is this, to worship the God who made all things; whom if
you receive in your minds, you shall receive from Him, along with the
first excellent things, also the future eternal blessings.
