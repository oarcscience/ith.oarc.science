id="vi.iii.iv.xxxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXI.—Peace and War.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iv.xxxi-p2"></span>“Thus, therefore, we, observing the
commands of our Master, first offer peace to our hearers, that the way
of salvation may be known without any tumult.  But if any one do not
receive the words of peace, nor acquiesce in the truth, we know how to
direct against him the war of the word, and to rebuke him sharply by
confuting his ignorance and charging home upon him his sins.  Therefore
of necessity we offer peace, that if any one is a son of peace, our
peace may come upon him; but from him who makes himself an enemy of
peace, our peace shall return to ourselves.  We do not therefore, as you
say, propose peace by agreement with the wicked, for indeed we should
straightway have given you the right hand; but only in order that,
through our discussing quietly and patiently, it might be more easily
ascertained by the hearers which is the true speech.  But if you differ
and disagree with yourself, how shall you stand?  He must of necessity
fall who is divided in himself; ‘for every kingdom divided against
itself shall not stand.’ <span id="fr_625"></span>[626](#fn_625.md)   If
you have aught to say to this, say on.”
