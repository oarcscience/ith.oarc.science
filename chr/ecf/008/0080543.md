id="vi.iii.xii.xxxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXV.—Uselessness of These
Allegories.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.xii.xxxv-p2"></span>When Niceta had thus spoken, Aquila
answered: <span id="fr_873"></span>[874](#fn_873)   “Whoever he was that
was the author and inventor of these things, he seems to me to have been
very impious, since he covered over those things which seem to be
pleasant and seemly, and made the ritual of his superstition to consist
in base and shameful observances, since those things which are written
according to the letter are manifestly unseemly and base; and the whole
observance of their religion consists in these, that by such crimes and
impieties they may teach men to imitate their gods whom <span
id="page_202">p. 202</span> <span
id="vi.iii.xii.xxxv-Page_202"></span>they worship.  For in these
allegories what profit can there be to them?  For although they are
framed so as to be decent, yet no use is derived from them for worship,
nor for amendment of morals.
