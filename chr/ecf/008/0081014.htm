<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xvi.ix-p2"></A>When Faustinus had said this, our mother fell down at Peter&#146;s feet, begging and entreating him to send for her and her hostess, and baptize them immediately, in order that, says she, not a single day may pass after the recovery of my children, without my taking food with them.&#160; When we united with our mother in making the same request, Peter said:&#160; &#8220;What can you imagine?&#160; Am I alone heartless, so as not to wish that you should take your meals with your mother, baptizing her this very day?&#160; But yet it is incumbent on her to fast one day before she be baptized.&#160; And it is only one day, because, in her simplicity, she said something in her own behalf, which I looked on as a sufficient indication of her faith; otherwise, her purification must have lasted many days.&#8221;</p>
