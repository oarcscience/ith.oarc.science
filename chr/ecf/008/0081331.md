id="vii.xvi.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 13 (29).</span>

<span id="vii.xvi.xiii-p2"></span>Pilate, hearing these words of Annas
and Caiaphas, laid them all up in the acts of our Lord and Saviour, in
the public records of his prætorium, and wrote a letter to Claudius,
king of the city of Rome, <span id="fr_2002"></span>[2003](#fn_2002)
saying:—

<span id="vii.xvi.xiii-p4"></span>Pontius Pilate to Claudius his king,
greeting.  It has lately happened, as I myself have also proved, that
the Jews, through envy, have punished themselves and their posterity by
a cruel condemnation.  In short, when their fathers had a promise that
their God would send them from heaven his holy one, who should
deservedly be called their king, and promised that he would send him by
a virgin upon the earth:  when, therefore, while I was procurator, he
had come into Judæa, and when they saw him enlightening the blind,
cleansing the lepers, curing the paralytics, making demons flee from
men, even raising the dead, commanding the winds, walking dryshod upon
the waves of the sea, and doing many other signs of miracles; and when
all the people of the Jews said that he was the Son of God, the chief
priests felt envy against him, and seized him, and delivered him to me;
and, telling me one lie after another, they said that he was a sorcerer,
and was acting contrary to their law.

<span id="vii.xvi.xiii-p5"></span>And I believed that it was so, and
delivered him to be scourged, according to their will.  And they
crucified him, and set guards over him when buried.  And he rose again
on the third day, while my soldiers were keeping guard.  But so flagrant
was the iniquity of the Jews, that they gave money to my soldiers,
saying, Say that his disciples have stolen his body.  But after
receiving the money they could not keep secret what had been done; for
they bore witness both that he had risen again, that they had seen
him, <span id="fr_2003"></span>[2004](#fn_2003) and that they had
received money from the Jews.

<span id="vii.xvi.xiii-p7"></span>This accordingly I have done, lest any
one should give a different and a false account of it, and lest thou
shouldst think that the lies of the Jews are to be believed.
