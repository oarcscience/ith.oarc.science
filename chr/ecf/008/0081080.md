Simon.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xx.vi-p2"></span>“These and such like were the
statements, Peter, which Simon addressed to the multitudes while he
stood outside; and he seems to me to be disturbing the minds of the
greater number.  Wherefore go forth immediately, and by the power of
truth break down his false statements.”  When Zacchæus said this, Peter
prayed after his usual manner and went out, and standing in the place
where he spoke the day before, and saluting the multitudes according to
the custom enjoined by his religion, he began to speak as follows:  “Our
Lord Jesus Christ, who is the true prophet (as I shall prove
conclusively at the proper time), made concise declarations in regard to
those matters that relate to the truth, for these two reasons:  first,
because He was in the habit of addressing the pious, who had knowledge
enough to enable them to believe the opinions uttered by Him by way of
declaration; for His statements were not strange to their usual mode of
thought; and in the second place, because, having a limited time
assigned Him for preaching, He did not employ the method of
demonstration in order that He might not spend all His limited time in
arguments, for in this way it might happen that He would be fully
occupied in giving the solutions of a few problems which might be
understood by mental exertion, while He would not have given us to any
great extent <span id="fr_1327"></span>[1328](#fn_1327.md) those statements
which relate to the truth.  Accordingly He stated any opinions He
wished, as to a people who were able to understand Him, to whom we also
belong, who, whenever we did not understand anything of what had been
said by Him,—a thing which rarely happened,—inquired of Him privately,
that nothing said by Him might be unintelligible to us.
