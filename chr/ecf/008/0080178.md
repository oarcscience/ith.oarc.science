id="vi.iii.iv.xli-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLI.—The Answer,
Continued.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iv.xli-p2"></span>“Listen, then,” says Peter, “that you
may know, first of all, that even if there are many gods, as you say,
they are subject to the God of the Jews, to whom no one is equal, than
whom no one can be greater; for it is written that the prophet Moses
thus spoke to the Jews:  ‘The Lord your God is the God of gods, and the
Lord of lords, the great God.’ <span id="fr_639"></span>[640](#fn_639.md)  
Thus, although there are many that are called gods, yet He who is the
God of the Jews is alone called the God of gods.  For not every one that
is called God is necessarily God.  Indeed, even Moses is called a god to
Pharaoh, <span id="fr_640"></span>[641](#fn_640.md) and it is certain that
he was a man; and judges were called gods, and it is evident that they
were mortal.  The idols also of the Gentiles are called gods, and we all
know that they are not; but this has been inflicted as a punishment on
the wicked, that because they would not acknowledge the true God, they
should regard as God whatever form or image should occur to them. 
Because they refused to receive the knowledge of the One who, as I said,
is God of all, therefore it is permitted to them to have as gods those
who can do nothing for their worshippers.  For what can either dead
images or living creatures confer upon men, since the power of all
things is with One?
