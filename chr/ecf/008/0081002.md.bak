id="vi.iv.xv.xxxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXI.—“Howbeit, They Meant It
Not.”</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xv.xxxi-p2"></span>To this I answered, “Those,
therefore, who do wrong are not guilty, because they wrong the just by
the judgment of God.”  Then Peter said, “They indeed sin greatly, for
they have given themselves to sin.  Wherefore knowing this, *God*
chooses from among them *some* to punish those who righteously repented
of their former sins, that the evil things done by the just before their
repentance may be remitted through this punishment.  But to the wicked
who punish and desire to ill-use them, and will not repent, it is
permitted to ill-use the righteous for the filling up of their own
punishment.  For without the will of God, not even a sparrow can fall
into a girn. <span id="fr_1152"></span>[1153](#fn_1152.md)   Thus even the
hairs of the righteous are numbered by God.
