<span id="vi.iii.iv.xlvi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iii.iv.xlvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLVI.—Christ Acknowledged the
God of the Jews.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iv.xlvi-p2"></span>“Wherefore also our Lord, who
wrought signs and wonders, preached the God of the Jews; and therefore
we are right in believing what He preached.  But as for you, even if you
were really a prophet, and performed signs and wonders, as you promise
to do, if you were to announce other gods besides Him who is the true
God, it would be manifest that you were raised up as a trial to the
people of God; and therefore you can by no means be believed.  For He
alone is the true God, who is the God of the Jews; and for this reason
our Lord Jesus Christ did not teach them that they must inquire after
God, for Him they knew well already, but that they must seek His kingdom
and righteousness, <span id="fr_655"></span>[656](#fn_655.md) which the
scribes and Pharisees, having received the key of knowledge, had not
shut in, but shut out. <span id="fr_656"></span>[657](#fn_656.md)   For if
they had been ignorant of the true God, surely He would never have left
the knowledge of this thing, which was the chief of all, and blamed them
for small and little things, as for enlarging their fringes, and
claiming the uppermost rooms in feasts, and praying standing in the
highways, and such like things; which assuredly, in comparison of this
great charge, ignorance of God, seem to be small and insignificant
matters.”
