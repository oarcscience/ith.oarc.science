<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xxi.xi-p2"></A>And Simon said:&#160; It contributes much to victory, if the man who wars uses his own weapons; for what one loves he can in real earnest defend, and that which is defended with genuine earnestness has no ordinary power in it.&#160; Wherefore in future I shall lay before you my real opinions.&#160; I maintain that there is some unrevealed power, unknown to all, even to the Creator himself, as Jesus himself has also declared, though he did not know what he said.&#160; For when one talks a great deal he sometimes hits the truth, not knowing what he is saying.&#160; I am referring to the statement which he uttered, &#145;No one knows the Father.&#146;&#8221;&#160; And Peter said:&#160; &#8220;Do not any longer profess that you know His doctrines.&#8221;&#160; And Simon said:&#160; &#8220;I do not profess to believe his doctrines; but I am discussing points in which he was by accident right.&#8221;&#160; And Peter said:&#160; &#8220;Not to give you any pretext for escape, I shall carry on the discussion with you in the way you wish.&#160; At the same time, I call all to witness that you do not yet believe the statement which you just now made.&#160; For I know your opinions.&#160; And in order that you may not imagine that I am not speaking the truth, I shall expound your opinions, that you may know that you are discussing with one who is well acquainted with them.</p>
