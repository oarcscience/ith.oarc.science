<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.iv.xxxv-p2"></A>Then Simon said:&#160; &#8220;Instruct us, therefore, how it can be consistent that he who causes divisions, which divisions cause those who are divided to fall, can either seem to be good, or to have come for the salvation of men.&#8221;&#160; Then Peter said:&#160; &#8220;I will tell you how our Master said that every kingdom and every house divided against itself cannot stand; and whereas He Himself did this, see how it makes for salvation.&#160; By the word of truth He certainly divides the kingdom of the world, which is founded in error, and every home in it, that error may fall, and truth may reign.&#160; But if it happen to any house, that error, being introduced by any one, divides the truth, then, where error has gained a footing, it is certain that truth cannot stand.&#8221;&#160; Then Simon said:&#160; &#8220;But it is uncertain whether your master divides error or truth.&#8221;&#160; Then Peter:&#160; &#8220;That belongs to another question; but if you are agreed that everything which is divided falls, it remains that I show, if only you will hear in peace, that our Jesus has divided and dispelled error by teaching truth.&#8221;</p>
