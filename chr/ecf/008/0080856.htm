<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.x.xi-p2"></A>&#8220;Were I able to cause earthquakes, and do all that I wish, I assure you I would not destroy Simon and his friends (for not to destroy men am I sent), but would make him my friend, that he might no longer, by his slanders against my preaching the truth, hinder the salvation of many.&#160; But if you believe me, he himself is a magician; he is a slanderer; he is a minister of evil to them who know not the truth.&#160; Therefore he has power to bring diseases on sinners, having the sinners themselves to help him in his power over them.&#160; But I am a servant of God the Creator of all things, and a disciple of His Prophet who is at His right hand.&#160; Wherefore I, being His apostle, preach the truth:&#160; to serve a good man I drive away diseases, for I am His second messenger, since first the disease comes, but after that the healing.&#160; By that evil-working magician, then, you were stricken with disease because you revolted from God.&#160; By me, if you believe on Him ye shall be cured:&#160; and so having had experience that He is able, you may turn to good works, and have your souls saved.&#8221;</p>
