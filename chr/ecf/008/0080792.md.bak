id="vi.iv.viii.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V.—Theory of Magic.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.viii.v-p2"></span>“Then Appion said:  ‘Admit that I know
more of these things than you do.  However, that you may not think that
there is nothing in what you have heard from me in reference to what you
have said, I will tell you how the demons are under necessity to obey
the magicians in the matters about which they are commanded.  For as it
is impossible for a soldier to contradict his general, and impossible
for the generals themselves to disobey the king—for if any one oppose
those set over him, he is altogether deserving of punishment—so it is
impossible for the demons not to serve the angels who are their
generals; and when they are adjured by them, they yield trembling, well
knowing that if they disobey they shall be fully punished.  But the
angels also themselves, being adjured by the magicians in the name of
their ruler, obey, lest, being found guilty of disobedience, they be
destroyed.  For unless all things that are living and rational foresaw
vengeance from the ruler, confusion would ensue, all revolting against
one another.’
