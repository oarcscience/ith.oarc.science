<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.vii.xxiv-p2"></A>&#8220;But to these things the serpent answers us with another mouth, and says:&#160; If God did not wish these things to be, then they should not be.&#160; I am not telling you how it is that many contrary things are permitted to be in this world for the probation of every one&#146;s mind.&#160; But this is what is suitable to be said in the meantime:&#160; If, according to you, everything that was to be worshipped ought not to have been, there would have been almost nothing in this world.&#160; For what is there that you have left without worshipping it?&#160; The sun, the moon, the stars, the water, the earth, mountains, trees, stones, men; there is no one of these that ye have not worshipped.&#160; According to your saying, therefore, none of these ought to have been made by God, that you might not have anything that you could worship!&#160; Yea, He ought not even to have made men themselves to be the worshippers!&#160; But this is the very thing which that serpent which lurks within you desires:&#160; for he spares none of you; he would have no one of you escape from destruction.&#160; But it shall not be so.&#160; For I tell you, that not that which is worshipped is in fault, but he who worships.&#160; For with God is righteous judgment; and He judges in one way the sufferer, and in another way the doer, of wrong.</p>
