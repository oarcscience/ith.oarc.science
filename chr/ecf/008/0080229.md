Things Made by the Incorruptible and Eternal.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.v.xix-p2"></span>Then Simon:  “It does not seem to me
that the heaven, which has been made by God, can be dissolved.  For
things made by the Eternal One are eternal, while things made by a
corruptible one are temporary and decaying.”  Then Peter:  “It is not
so.  Indeed corruptible and temporary things of all sorts are made by
mortal creatures; but the Eternal does not always make things
corruptible, nor always incorruptible; but according to the will of God
the Creator, so will be the things which He creates.  For the power of
God is not subject to law, but His will is law to His creatures.”  Then
Simon answered:  “I call you back to the first question.  You said now
that God is visible to no one; but when that heaven shall be dissolved,
and that superior condition of the heavenly kingdom shall shine forth,
then those who are pure in heart <span id="fr_685"></span>[686](#fn_685)
shall see God; which statement is contrary to the law, for there it is
written that God said, ‘None shall see my face and live.’” <span
