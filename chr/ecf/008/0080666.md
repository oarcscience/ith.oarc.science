id="vi.iv.v.xxxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXIII.—Doctrine of
Pairs.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.v.xxxiii-p2"></span>These things having been thus
spoken, the excellent Peter himself also proceeded to speak: <span
id="fr_942"></span>[943](#fn_942.md)   “You must perceive, brethren, the
truth of the rule of conjunction, from which he who departs not cannot
be misled.  For since, as we have said, we see all things in pairs and
contraries, and as the night is first, and then the day; and first
ignorance, then knowledge; first disease, then healing, so the things of
error come first into our life, then truth supervenes, as the physician
upon the disease.  Therefore straightway, when our God-loved nation was
about to be ransomed from the oppression of the Egyptians, first
diseases were produced by means of the rod turned into a serpent, which
was given to Aaron, and then remedies were superinduced by the prayers
of Moses.  And now also, when the Gentiles are about to be ransomed from
the superstition with respect to idols, wickedness, which reigns over
them, has by anticipation sent forth her ally like another serpent, even
this Simon whom you see, who works wonders to astonish and deceive, not
signs of healing to convert and save.  Wherefore it behoves you also
from the miracles that are done to judge the doers, what is the
character of the performer, and what that of the deed.  If he do
unprofitable miracles, he is the agent of wickedness; but if he do
profitable things, he is a leader of goodness.
