<span id="vi.iii.x.i-p3"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iii.x.i-p3.1"></span>Now</span> the next morning Peter took my
brothers and me with him, and we went down to the harbour to bathe in
the sea, and thereafter we retired to a certain secret place for
prayer.  But a certain poor old man, a workman, as he appeared by his
dress, began to observe us eagerly, without our seeing him, that he
might see what we were doing in secret. <span
id="fr_805"></span>[806](#fn_805.md)   And when he saw us praying, he
waited till we came out, and then saluted us, and said:  “If you do not
take it amiss, and regard me as an inquisitive and importunate person, I
should wish to converse with you; for I take pity on you, and would not
have you err under the appearance of truth, and be afraid of things that
have no existence; or if you think that there is any truth in them, then
declare it to me.  If, therefore, you take it patiently, I can in a few
words instruct you in what is right; but if it be unpleasant to you, I
shall go on, and do my business.”  To him Peter answered:  “Speak what
you think good, and we will gladly hear, whether it be true or false;
for you are to be welcomed, because, like a father anxious on behalf of
his children, you wish to put us in possession of what you regard as
good.”

<span id="vi.iii.x.i-p4"></span> \[From this point there are
considerable variations in the two narratives.  The old man becomes, in
the *Recognitions*, a prominent participant in the discussions, arguing
with Peter, and with Niceta, Aquila, and Clement.  At the close of these
discussions he is recognised first by the sons (ix. 35), and then by his
wife, as Faustinianus (ix. 37).  In the *Homilies* Peter tells of an
interview with the old man (xiv. 2–8), and the recognition takes place
immediately upon his appearance (xiv. 9).  Some discussion with him
follows (Homily XV.); but soon the main controversy is with Simon Magus
(Homilies XVI.–XIX.), in the presence of the father, who is convinced by
Peter.  Book x. contains much matter introduced in Homilies IV.–VII. 
The correspondences will be indicated in the footnotes.—R.\]
