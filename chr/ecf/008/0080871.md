Angels.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xi.xiii-p2"></span>“But when, having assumed these
forms, they convicted as covetous those who stole them, and <span
id="page_273">p. 273</span> <span
id="vi.iv.xi.xiii-Page_273"></span>changed themselves into the nature of
men, in order that, living holily, and showing the possibility of so
living, they might subject the ungrateful to punishment, yet having
become in all respects men, they also partook of human lust, and being
brought under its subjection they fell into cohabitation with
women; <span id="fr_1097"></span>[1098](#fn_1097) and being involved
with them, and sunk in defilement and altogether emptied of their first
power, were unable to turn back to the first purity of their proper
nature, their members turned away from their fiery substance: <span
id="fr_1098"></span>[1099](#fn_1098)   for the fire itself, being
extinguished by the weight of lust, *and changed* into flesh, they trode
the impious path downward.  For they themselves, being fettered with the
bonds of flesh, were constrained and strongly bound; wherefore they have
no more been able to ascend into the heavens.
