id="vi.iv.xxii.xxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXV.—Simon Retires.  Sophonias
Asks Peter to State His Real Opinions in Regard to Evil.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxii.xxv-p2"></span>And Simon hearing this, gnashed his
teeth for rage, and went away in silence.  But Peter (for a considerable
portion of the day still remained) laid his hands on the large multitude
to heal them; and having dismissed them, went into the house with his
more intimate friends, and sat down.  And one of his attendants, of the
name of Sophonias, said:  “Blessed is God, O Peter, who selected you and
instructed <span id="fr_1476"></span>[1477](#fn_1476.md) you for the
comfort of the good.  For, in truth, you discussed with Simon with
dignity and great patience.  But we beg of you to discourse to us of
evil; for we expect that you will state to us your own genuine belief in
regard to it,—not, however at the present moment, but to-morrow, if it
seems good to you:  for we spare you, because of the fatigue you feel on
account of your discussion.”  And Peter said:  “I wish you to know, that
he who does anything with pleasure, finds rest in the very toils
themselves; but he <span id="page_339">p. 339</span> <span
id="vi.iv.xxii.xxv-Page_339"></span>who does not do what he wishes, is
rendered exceedingly weary by the very rest he takes.  Wherefore you
confer on me a great rest when you make me discourse on topics which
please me.”  Content, then, with his disposition, and sparing him on
account of his fatigue, we requested him to put the discussion off till
the night, when it was his custom to discourse to his genuine friends. 
And partaking of salt, we turned to sleep.
