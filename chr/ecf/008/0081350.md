id="vii.xxiii.i-p3.1"></span>Narrative of Joseph of Arimathæa, That
Begged the Lord’s Body; In Which Also He Brings In the Cases of the Two
Robbers.</span>

<span id="vii.xxiii.i-p4"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="vii.xxiii.i-p4.1"></span>Chapter 1.</span>

<span id="vii.xxiii.i-p5"></span>I *am* Joseph of Arimathæa, who begged
from Pilate the body of the Lord Jesus for burial, and who for this
cause was kept close in prison by the murderous and God-fighting <span
id="fr_2031"></span>[2032](#fn_2031) Jews, who also, keeping to the law,
have by Moses himself become partakers in tribulation and having
provoked their Lawgiver to anger, and not knowing that He was God,
crucified Him and made Him manifest to those that knew God.  In those
days in which they condemned the Son of God to be crucified, seven days
before Christ suffered, two condemned robbers were sent from Jericho to
the procurator Pilate; and their case was as follows:—

<span id="vii.xxiii.i-p7"></span>The first, his name Gestas, put
travellers to death, murdering them with the sword, and others he
exposed naked.  And he hung up women by the heels, head down, and cut
off their breasts, and drank the blood of infants limbs, never having
known God, not obeying the laws, being violent from the beginning, and
doing such deeds.

<span id="vii.xxiii.i-p8"></span>And the case of the other was as
follows:  He was called Demas, and was by birth a Galilæan, and kept an
inn.  He made attacks upon the rich, but was good to the poor—a thief
like Tobit, for he buried the bodies of the poor. <span
id="fr_2032"></span>[2033](#fn_2032)   And he set his hand to robbing
the multitude of the Jews, and stole the law <span
id="fr_2033"></span>[2034](#fn_2033) itself in Jerusalem, and stripped
naked the daughter of Caiaphas, who was priestess of the sanctuary, and
took away from its place the mysterious deposit itself placed there by
Solomon.  Such were his doings.

<span id="vii.xxiii.i-p11"></span>And Jesus also was taken on the third
day before the passover, in the evening.  And to Caiaphas and the
multitude of the Jews it was not a passover, but it was a great mourning
to them, on account of the plundering of the sanctuary by the robber. 
And they summoned Judas Iscariot, and spoke to him, for he was *son* of
the brother <span id="fr_2034"></span>[2035](#fn_2034) of Caiaphas the
priest.  He was not a disciple before the face of Jesus; but all the
multitude of the Jews craftily supported him, that he might follow
Jesus, not that he might be obedient to the miracles done by Him, nor
that he might confess Him, but that he might betray Him to them, wishing
to catch up some lying word of Him, giving him gifts for such brave,
honest conduct to the amount of a half shekel of gold each day.  And he
did this for two years with Jesus, as says one of His disciples called
John.

<span id="vii.xxiii.i-p13"></span>And on the third day, before Jesus was
laid hold of, Judas says to the Jews:  Come, let us hold a council; for
perhaps it was not the robber that stole the law, but Jesus himself, and
I accuse him.  And when these words had been spoken, Nicodemus, who kept
the keys of the sanctuary, came in to us, and said to all:  Do not do
such a deed.  For Nicodemus was true, more than all the multitude of the
Jews.  And the daughter of Caiaphas, Sarah by name, cried out, and
said:  He himself said before all against this holy place, I am able to
destroy this temple, and in three days to raise it.  The Jews say to
her:  Thou hast credit with all of us.  For they regarded her as a
prophetess.  And assuredly, after the council had been held, Jesus was
laid hold of.
