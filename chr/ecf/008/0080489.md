<span id="vi.iii.xi.xx-p2"></span>“There are likewise amongst the
Bactrians, in the Indian countries, immense multitudes of Brahmans, who
also themselves, from the tradition of their ancestors, and peaceful
customs and laws, neither commit murder nor adultery, nor worship idols,
nor have the practice of eating animal food, are never drunk, never do
anything maliciously, but always fear God.  And these things indeed they
do, though the rest of the Indians commit both murders and adulteries,
and worship idols, and are drunken, and practise other wickednesses of
this sort.  Yea, in the western parts of India itself there is a certain
country, where strangers, when they enter it, are taken and slaughtered
and eaten; and neither have good stars prevented these men from such
wickednesses and from accursed food, nor have malign stars compelled the
Brahmans to do any evil.  Again, there is a custom among the Persians to
marry mothers, and sisters, and daughters.  In all that district the
Persians contract incestuous marriages.
