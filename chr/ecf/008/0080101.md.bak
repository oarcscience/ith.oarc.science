id="vi.iii.iii.xxxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXIX.—Baptism Instituted in
Place of Sacrifices.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iii.xxxix-p2"></span>“But when the time began to draw
near that what was wanting in the Mosaic institutions should be
supplied, as we have said, and that the Prophet should appear, of whom
he had foretold that He should warn them by the mercy of God to cease
from sacrificing; lest haply they might suppose that on the cessation of
sacrifice there was no remission of sins for them, He instituted baptism
by water amongst them, in which they might be absolved from all their
sins on the invocation of His name, and for the future, following a
perfect life, might abide in immortality, being purified not by the
blood of beasts, but by the purification of the Wisdom of God. 
Subsequently also an evident proof of this great mystery is supplied *in
the fact*, that every one who, believing in this Prophet who had been
foretold by Moses, is baptized in His name, shall be kept unhurt from
the destruction of war which impends over the unbelieving nation, and
the place itself; but that those who do not believe shall be made exiles
from their place and kingdom, that even against their will they may
understand and obey the will of God.”
