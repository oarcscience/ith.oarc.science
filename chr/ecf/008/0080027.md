<span id="v.iii.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iii.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II.—For True Virginity Perfect Virtue
is Necessary.</span>

<span id="v.iii.ii-p2"></span>Of all virgins of either sex who have
truly resolved to preserve virginity for the sake of the kingdom of
heaven—of each and every one of them it is required that he be worthy of
the kingdom of heaven in every thing.  For not by eloquence <span
id="fr_294"></span>[295](#fn_294.md) or renown, <span
id="fr_295"></span>[296](#fn_295.md) by station <span
id="fr_296"></span>[297](#fn_296.md) and descent, or by beauty or strength,
or by length of life, <span id="fr_297"></span>[298](#fn_297.md) is the
kingdom of heaven obtained; but it is obtained by the power of faith,
when a man exhibits the works of faith.  For whosoever is truly
righteous, his works testify concerning his faith, that he is truly a
believer, with a faith which is great, a faith which is perfect, a faith
which is in God, a faith which shines in good works, that the Father of
all may be glorified through Christ.  Now, those who are truly virgins
for the sake of God give heed to Him who hath said, “Let not
righteousness and faith fail thee; bind them on thy neck, and thou shalt
find favour for thyself; and devise thou good things before God and
before men.” <span id="fr_298"></span>[299](#fn_298.md)   “The paths,”
therefore, “of the righteous shine as the light, and the light of them
advances until the day is perfect.” <span
id="fr_299"></span>[300](#fn_299.md)   For the beams of their light
illumine the whole creation even now by good works, as those who are
truly “the light of the world,” <span id="fr_300"></span>[301](#fn_300.md)
giving light to “those who sit in darkness,” <span
id="fr_301"></span>[302](#fn_301.md) that they may arise and go forth from
the darkness by the light of the good works of the fear of God, “that
they may see our good works and glorify our Father who is in
heaven.” <span id="fr_302"></span>[303](#fn_302.md)   For it is required of
the man of God, that in all his words and works he be perfect, and that
in his life he be adorned with all exemplary and well-ordered
behaviour, <span id="fr_303"></span>[304](#fn_303.md) and do all his deeds
in righteousness, as a man of God.
