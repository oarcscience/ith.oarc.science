<span id="vi.iii.ix.xiv-p2"></span>Then Peter said:  “Do you think, O
woman, that those who destroy themselves are set free from torments, and
not rather that the souls of those who lay violent hands upon themselves
are subjected to greater punishments?”  Then said she:  “I wish I were
sure that souls live in the infernal regions, for I would gladly embrace
the suffering of the penalty of suicide, only that I might see my
darling children, if it were but for an hour.”  Then Peter:  “What thing
is it so great, that effects you with so heavy sadness?  I should like
to know.  For if you informed me of the cause, I might be able both to
show you clearly, O woman, that souls do live in the infernal regions;
and instead of the precipice or the deep sea, I might give you some
remedy, that you may be able to end your life without torment.”
