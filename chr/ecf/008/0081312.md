id="vii.xv.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 11.</span>

<span id="vii.xv.xii-p2"></span>And it was about the sixth hour, and
there was darkness over the whole earth; and the sun was obscured, and
the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.  And crying out with a
loud voice, He said:  Father, into Thy hands I commend my spirit.  And
thus saying, He gave up the ghost.  And the centurion, seeing what was
done, glorified God, saying:  This was a just man.  And all the people
who were present at that spectacle, seeing what was done, beating their
breasts, returned.

<span id="vii.xv.xii-p3"></span>And the centurion reported to the
governor what was done.  And the governor and his wife hearing, were
very sorrowful, and neither ate nor drank that day.  And Pilate, calling
together the Jews, said to them:  Have you seen what has been done?  And
they said to the governor:  There has been an eclipse of the sun, as is
usual.

<span id="vii.xv.xii-p4"></span>And his acquaintances also stood afar
off, and the women who had followed Him from Galilee, seeing these
things.  And lo, a certain man, by name Joseph, holding office, a man
good and just, who did not consent to their counsels nor their deeds,
from Arimathæa, <span id="fr_1962"></span>[1963](#fn_1962) a city of the
Jews, waiting, he also, for the kingdom of God, went to Pilate and
begged the body of Jesus.  And taking Him down from the cross, he
wrapped Him in clean linen, and laid Him in his own new tomb, in which
no one had been laid.
