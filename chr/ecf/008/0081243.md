Foot.</span>

<span id="vii.x.viii-p2"></span>And a few days thereafter, a boy in that
town was splitting wood, and struck his foot.  And a great crowd went to
him, and Jesus too went with them.  And He touched the foot which had
been hurt, and immediately it was made whole.  And Jesus said to him: 
Rise, and split the wood, and remember me.  And when the crowd saw the
miracles that were done by Him, they adored Jesus, and said:  Indeed we
most surely believe that Thou art God.
