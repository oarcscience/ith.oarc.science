Idolatry.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xiii.xxiii-p2"></span>“Nay, it will be said; but they
are detected by their foresight.  It is false; for how many of them have
not been detected?  And if on account of the capture of some it be said
that they have power, it is a mistake.  For of those who rob tombs, some
are found out and some escape; but it is not by the power of the dead
that those who are apprehended are detected.  And such ought to be our
conclusion with respect to those who steal and pilfer the gods.  But it
will be said, The gods that are in them take no care of their images. 
Why, then, do you tend them, wiping them, and washing them, and scouring
them, crowning them, and sacrificing to them?  Wherefore agree with me
that you act altogether without right reason.  For as you lament over
the dead, so you sacrifice and make libations to your gods.
