Kindled?</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xiv.xx-p2"></span>“And let not any one say, How is this
just, that parents should be separated from their children, and children
from their parents?  It is just, even entirely.  For if they remained
with them, and, after profiting them nothing, were also destroyed along
with them, how is it not just that he who wishes to be saved should be
separated from him who will not, but who wishes to destroy him along
with himself.  Moreover, it is not those who judge better that wish to
be separated, but they wish to stay with them, and to profit them by the
exposition of better things; and therefore the unbelievers, not wishing
to hearken to them, make war against them, banishing, persecuting,
hating them.  But those who suffer these things, pitying those who are
ensnared by ignorance, by the teaching of wisdom pray for those who
contrive evil against them, having learned that ignorance is the cause
of their sin.  For the Teacher Himself, being nailed to *the cross*,
prayed to the Father that the sin of those who slew Him might be
forgiven, saying, ‘Father, forgive them their sins, for they know not
what they do.’ <span id="fr_1132"></span>[1133](#fn_1132.md)   They also
therefore, being imitators of the Teacher in their sufferings, pray for
those who contrive them, as they have been taught.  Therefore they are
not separated as hating their parents, since they make constant prayers
even for those who are neither parents nor relatives, but enemies, and
strive to love them, as they have been commanded.
