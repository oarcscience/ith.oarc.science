Instructions.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iii.xxii-p2"></span>When he had said this, he began to
expound to me point by point of those chapters of the law which seemed
to be in question, from the beginning of the creation even to that point
of time at which I came to him at Cæsarea, telling me that the delay of
Simon had contributed to my learning all things in order.  “At other
times,” said he, “we shall discourse more fully on individual points of
which we have now spoken shortly, according as the occasion of our
conversation shall bring them before us; so that, according to my
promise, you may gain a full and perfect knowledge of all.  Since, then,
by this delay we have to-day on our hands, I wish to repeat to you again
what has been spoken, that it may be the better recalled to your
memory.”  Then he began in this way to refresh my recollection of what
he had said:  “Do you remember, O friend Clement, the account I gave you
of the eternal age, that knows no end?”  Then said I, “Never, O Peter,
shall I retain anything, if I can lose or forget that.”
