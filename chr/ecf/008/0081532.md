<span id="x.xviii-p3"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="x.xviii-p3.1"></span>Here</span> our author mentions that he noted
the succession of Bishops at Rome, but he gives his list with no remark
about Rome in particular.  He adds that “in every succession and in
every city (i.e., in every See) a primitive accordance with the law and
the Gospel is maintained.”  How can our excellent Lightfoot <span
id="fr_3865"></span>[3866](#fn_3865) give it a colour wholly gratuitous
in these words:  “He interested himself in the succession of the Roman
See, *intent, like Irenæus* in the next generation, on showing the
permanence of the orthodox tradition, through the continuity of the
Roman episcopate.”  Irenæus, who, above all the Westerns, is identified
with the Orient!

<span id="x.xviii-p5"></span>Where is the evidence of any such idea or
“intent”?  As for Irenæus, his testimony has been sufficiently
illustrated before, with proof that his words have not the slightest
reference to the continuity of the Roman more than any other See, save
only as the influx of visitors from other Sees helped to give it
orthodoxy by their concurrent testimony. <span
