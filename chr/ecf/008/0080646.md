id="vi.iv.v.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIII.—Future Rewards and
Punishments.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiii-p2"></span>“For there is every necessity, that he
who says that God is by His nature righteous, should believe also that
the souls of men are immortal:  for where would be His justice, when
some, having lived piously, have been evil-treated, and sometimes
violently cut off, while others who have been wholly impious, and have
indulged in luxurious living, have died the common death of men?  Since
therefore, without all contradiction, God who is good is also just, He
shall not otherwise be known to be just, unless the soul after its
separation from the body be immortal, so that the wicked man, being in
hell, <span id="fr_921"></span>[922](#fn_921) as having here received
his good things, may there be punished for his sins; and the good man,
who has been punished here for his sins, may then, as in the bosom of
the righteous, be constituted an heir of good things.  Since therefore
God is righteous, it is fully evident to us that there is a judgment,
and that souls are immortal.
