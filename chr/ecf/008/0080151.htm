<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.iv.xiv-p2"></A>&#8220;At those sayings of his Simon grew pale; but after a little, recollecting himself, he thus answered:&#160; &#145;Do not think that I am a man of your race.&#160; I am neither magician, nor lover <A NAME="page_101"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 101</FONT></A> <a name="vi.iii.iv.xiv-Page_101"></A>of Luna, nor son of Antonius.&#160; For before my mother Rachel and he came together, she, still a virgin, conceived me, while it was in my power to be either small or great, and to appear as a man among men.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_609"></A><A HREF="#fn_609"><FONT SIZE="1">610</FONT></A>
&#160; Therefore I have chosen you first as my friends, for the purpose of trying you, that I may place you first in my heavenly and unspeakable places when I shall have proved you.&#160; Therefore I have pretended to be a man, that I might more clearly ascertain if you cherish entire affection towards me.&#146;&#160; But when I heard that, judging him indeed to be a wretch, yet wondering at his impudence; and blushing for him, and at the same time fearing lest he should attempt some evil against us, I beckoned to Niceta to feign for a little along with me, and said to him:&#160; &#145;Be not angry with us, corruptible men, O thou incorruptible God, but rather accept our affection, and our mind willing to know who God is; for we did not till now know who thou art, nor did we perceive that thou art he whom we were seeking.&#146;&#8221;</p>
