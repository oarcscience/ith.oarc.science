<span id="vi.iv.xv.xxx-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.xv.xxx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXX.—Offences Must Come.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xv.xxx-p2"></span>“But the Master knowing that those who
wrongfully do these things are guilty by means of their former sins, and
that the spirit of wickedness works these things by means of the guilty,
has counselled to compassionate men, as they are men, and as being the
instruments of wickedness through sin; *and this counsel* He has given
to His disciples as claiming philanthropy, and, as much as in us lies,
to absolve the wrong-doers from condemnation, that, as it were, the
temperate may help the drunken, by prayers, fastings, and benedictions,
not resisting, not avenging, lest they should compel them to sin more. 
For when a person is condemned by any one to suffer, it is not
reasonable for him to be angry with him by whose means the suffering
comes; for he ought to reason, that if he had not ill-used him, yet
because he was to be ill-used, he must have suffered it by means of
another.  Why, then, should I be angry with the dispenser, when I was
condemned at all events to suffer?  But yet, further:  if we do these
same things to the evil on pretence of <span id="page_299">p. 299</span>
<span id="vi.iv.xv.xxx-Page_299"></span>revenge, we who are good do the
very things which the evil do, excepting that they do them first, and we
second; and, as I said, we ought not to be angry, as knowing that in the
providence of God, the evil punish the good.  Those, therefore, who are
bitter against their punishers, sin, as disdaining the messengers of
God; but those who honour them, and set themselves in opposition to
those who think to injure them, <span
id="fr_1151"></span>[1152](#fn_1151.md) are pious towards God who has thus
decreed.”
