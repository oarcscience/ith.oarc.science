id="vi.iii.iii.lxx-p1.1"></span>Chapter LXX.—Tumult Raised by
Saul.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iii.lxx-p2"></span>“And when matters were at that point
that they should come and be baptized, some one of our enemies, <span
id="fr_595"></span>[596](#fn_595.md) entering the temple with a few men,
began to cry out, and to say, ‘What mean ye, O men of Israel?  Why are
you so easily hurried on?  Why are ye led headlong by most miserable
men, who are deceived by Simon, a magician?’  While he was thus
speaking, and adding more to the same effect, and while James the bishop
was refuting him, he began to excite the people and to raise a tumult,
so that the people might not be able to hear what was said.  Therefore
he began to drive all into confusion with shouting, and to undo what had
been arranged with much labour, and at the same time to reproach the
priests, and to enrage them with revilings and abuse, and, like a
madman, to excite every one to murder, saying, ‘What do ye?  Why do ye
hesitate?  Oh sluggish and inert, why do we not lay hands upon them, and
pull all these fellows to pieces?’  When he had said this, he first,
seizing a strong brand from the altar, set the example of smiting.  Then
others also, seeing him, were carried away with like readiness.  Then
ensued a tumult on either side, of the beating and the beaten.  Much
blood is shed; there is a confused flight, in the midst of which that
enemy attacked James, and threw him headlong from the top of the steps;
and supposing him to be dead, he cared not to inflict further violence
upon him.”
