<span id="vi.iv.xix.i-p3"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iv.xix.i-p3.1"></span>At</span> break of day Peter went out, and
reaching the place where he was wont to discourse, he saw a great
multitude assembled.  At the very time when he was going to discourse,
one of his deacons entered, and said:  “Simon has come from
Antioch, <span id="fr_1246"></span>[1247](#fn_1246.md) starting as soon as
it was evening, having learned that you promised to speak on the

<span id="vi.iv.xix.i-p4"></span> \[Homilies XVI.–XIX., giving the
details of a second discussion with Simon at Laodicea, are peculiar to
this narrative.  Much of the matter finds a parallel in the longer
account of the previous discussion at Cæsarea in *Recognitions*, ii.
iii. (comp. Homily III.), but all the circumstances are different. 
Uhlhorn formerly regarded this portion of the *Homilies* as the nucleus
of the entire literature.  He has modified his view.  An analysis of the
discussion cannot be attempted; but in the footnote to *Recognitions*,
ii. 19, a general comparison is given of the three accounts of
discussions with Simon Magus.—R.\]

government or monarchy of God.”  It means that God alone is ruler.
