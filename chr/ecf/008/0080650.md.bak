Better.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.v.xvii-p2"></span>“In like manner, the combination with
respect to Elias, which behoved to have come, has been willingly put off
to another time, having determined to enjoy it conveniently
hereafter. <span id="fr_925"></span>[926](#fn_925.md)   Wherefore, also, he
who was among those born of woman came first; then he who was among
<span id="page_232">p. 232</span> <span
id="vi.iv.v.xvii-Page_232"></span>the sons of men came second.  It were
possible, following this order, to perceive to what series Simon
belongs, who came before me to the Gentiles, and to which I belong who
have come after him, and have come in upon him as light upon darkness,
as knowledge upon ignorance, as healing upon disease.  And thus, as the
true Prophet has told us, a false prophet must first come from some
deceiver; and then, in like manner, after the removal of the holy place,
the true Gospel must be secretly sent abroad for the rectification of
the heresies that shall be.  After this, also, towards the end,
Antichrist must first come, and then our Jesus must be revealed to be
indeed the Christ; and after this, the eternal light having sprung up,
all the things of darkness must disappear.

<span id="fn_925"></span>[231:926](0080650.htm#fr_925.md) <span
id="vi.iv.v.xvii-p2.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.v.xvii-p3"></span> In this sentence the text is probably
corrupted.  The general meaning seems to be, that he does not enter
fully at present into the subject of Elias, or John the Baptist, and the
Christ, the greatest among the sons of men, coming after, but that he
will return to the subject on a fitting occasion.
