Its Parts Can Be God.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xiii.xx-p2"></span>“But the world, not being
incomparable and unsurpassable, and altogether in all respects without
defect, cannot be God.  But if the whole world cannot be God, in respect
of its having been made, how much more should not its parts be
reasonably called God; I mean the parts that are by you called gods,
being made of gold and silver, brass and stone, or of any other material
whatsoever; and they constructed by mortal hand.  However, let us
further see how the terrible serpent through man’s mouth poisons those
who are seduced by his solicitations.
