<span id="vii.iv-p6"></span>1.  <span class="c9"><span
id="vii.iv-p6.1"></span>In</span> the records of the twelve tribes of
Israel was Joachim, a man rich exceedingly; and he brought his offerings
double, <span id="fr_1554"></span>[1555](#fn_1554.md) saying:  There shall
be of my superabundance to all the people, and there shall be the
offering for my forgiveness <span id="fr_1555"></span>[1556](#fn_1555.md)
to the Lord for a propitiation for me. <span
id="fr_1556"></span>[1557](#fn_1556.md)   For the great day of the Lord was
at hand, and the sons of Israel were bringing their offerings.  And
there stood over against him Rubim, saying:  It is not meet for thee
first to bring thine offerings, because thou hast not made seed in
Israel. <span id="fr_1557"></span>[1558](#fn_1557.md)   And Joachim was
exceedingly grieved, and went away to the registers of the twelve tribes
of the people, saying:  I shall see the registers of the twelve tribes
of Israel, as to whether I alone have not made seed in Israel.  And he
searched, and found that all the righteous had raised up seed in
Israel.  And he called to mind the patriarch Abraham, that in the last
day <span id="fr_1558"></span>[1559](#fn_1558.md) God gave him a son
Isaac.  And Joachim was exceedingly grieved, and did not come into the
presence of his wife; but he retired to the desert, <span
id="fr_1559"></span>[1560](#fn_1559.md) and there pitched his tent, and
fasted forty days and forty nights, <span
id="fr_1560"></span>[1561](#fn_1560.md) saying in himself:  I will not go
down either for food or for drink until the Lord my God shall look upon
me, and prayer shall be my food and drink.

<span id="vii.iv-p14"></span>2.  And his wife Anna <span
id="fr_1561"></span>[1562](#fn_1561.md) mourned in two mournings, and
lamented in two lamentations, saying:  I shall bewail my widowhood; I
shall bewail my childlessness.  And the great day of the Lord was at
hand; and Judith <span id="fr_1562"></span>[1563](#fn_1562.md) her
maid-servant said:  How long dost thou humiliate thy soul?  Behold, the
great day of the Lord is at hand, and it is unlawful for thee to mourn. 
But take this head-band, which the woman that made it gave to me; for it
is not proper that I should wear it, because I am a maid-servant, and it
has a royal appearance. <span id="fr_1563"></span>[1564](#fn_1563.md)   And
Anna said:  Depart from me; for I have not done such things, and the
Lord has brought me very low.  I fear that some wicked person has given
it to thee, and thou hast come to make me a sharer in thy sin.  And
Judith said:  Why should I curse thee, seeing that <span
id="fr_1564"></span>[1565](#fn_1564.md) the Lord hath shut thy womb, so as
not to give thee fruit in Israel?  And Anna was grieved exceedingly, and
put off her garments of mourning, and cleaned her head, and put on her
wedding garments, and about the ninth hour went down to the garden to
walk.  And she saw a laurel, and sat under it, and prayed to the Lord,
saying:  O God of our fathers, bless me and hear my prayer, as Thou
didst bless the womb of Sarah, and didst give her a son Isaac. <span
id="fr_1565"></span>[1566](#fn_1565.md)

<span id="vii.iv-p20"></span>3.  And gazing towards the heaven, she saw
a sparrow’s nest in the laurel, <span
id="fr_1566"></span>[1567](#fn_1566.md) and made a lamentation in herself,
saying:  Alas! who begot me? and what womb produced me? because I have
become a curse in the presence of the sons of Israel, and I have been
reproached, and they have driven me in derision out of the temple of the
Lord.  Alas! to what have I been likened?  I am not like the fowls of
the heaven, because even the fowls of the heaven are productive before
Thee, O Lord.  Alas! to what have I been likened?  I am not like the
beasts of the earth, because even the beasts of the earth are productive
before Thee, O Lord.  Alas! to what have I been likened?  I am not like
these waters, because <span id="page_362">p. 362</span> <span
id="vii.iv-Page_362"></span>even these waters are productive before
Thee, O Lord.  Alas! to what have I been likened?  I am not like this
earth, because even the earth bringeth forth its fruits in season, and
blesseth Thee, O Lord. <span id="fr_1567"></span>[1568](#fn_1567.md)

<span id="vii.iv-p23"></span>4.  And, behold, an angel of the Lord stood
by, saying:  Anna, Anna, the Lord hath heard thy prayer, and thou shalt
conceive, and shall bring forth; and thy seed shall be spoken of in all
the world.  And Anna said:  As the Lord my God liveth, if I beget either
male or female, I will bring it as a gift to the Lord my God; and it
shall minister to Him in holy things all the days of its life. <span
id="fr_1568"></span>[1569](#fn_1568.md)   And, behold, two angels came,
saying to her:  Behold, Joachim thy husband is coming with his
flocks. <span id="fr_1569"></span>[1570](#fn_1569.md)   For an angel of the
Lord went down to him, saying:  Joachim, Joachim, the Lord God hath
heard thy prayer.  Go down hence; for, behold, thy wife Anna shall
conceive.  And Joachim went down and called his shepherds, saying: 
Bring me hither ten she-lambs without spot or blemish, and they shall be
for the Lord my God; and bring me twelve tender calves, and they shall
be for the priests and the elders; and a hundred goats for all the
people.  And, behold, Joachim came with his flocks; and Anna stood by
the gate, and saw Joachim coming, and she ran and hung upon his neck,
saying:  Now I know that the Lord God hath blessed me exceedingly; for,
behold the widow no longer a widow, and I the childless shall conceive. 
And Joachim rested the first day in his house.

<span id="vii.iv-p26"></span>5.  And on the following day he brought his
offerings, saying in himself:  If the Lord God has been rendered
gracious to me, the plate <span id="fr_1570"></span>[1571](#fn_1570.md) on
the priest’s forehead will make it manifest to me.  And Joachim brought
his offerings, and observed attentively the priest’s plate when he went
up to the altar of the Lord, and he saw no sin in himself.  And Joachim
said:  Now I know that the Lord has been gracious unto me, and has
remitted all my sins.  And he went down from the temple of the Lord
justified, and departed to his own house.  And her months were
fulfilled, and in the ninth <span id="fr_1571"></span>[1572](#fn_1571.md)
month Anna brought forth.  And she said to the midwife:  What have I
brought forth? and she said:  A girl.  And said Anna:  My soul has been
magnified this day.  And she laid her down.  And the days having been
fulfilled, Anna was purified, and gave the breast to the child, <span
id="fr_1572"></span>[1573](#fn_1572.md) and called her name Mary.

<span id="vii.iv-p30"></span>6.  And the child grew strong day by day;
and when she was six <span id="fr_1573"></span>[1574](#fn_1573.md) months
old, her mother set her on the ground to try whether she could stand,
and she walked seven steps and came into her bosom; and she snatched her
up, saying:  As the Lord my God liveth, thou shalt not walk on this
earth until I bring thee into the temple of the Lord.  And she made a
sanctuary in her bed-chamber, and allowed nothing common or unclean to
pass through her.  And she called the undefiled daughters of the
Hebrews, and they led her astray. <span
id="fr_1574"></span>[1575](#fn_1574.md)   And when she was a year old,
Joachim made a great feast, and invited the priests, and the scribes,
and the elders, and all the people of Israel.  And Joachim brought the
child to the priests; and they blessed her, saying:  O God of our
fathers, bless this child, and give her an everlasting name to be named
in all generations.  And all the people said:  So be it, so be it,
amen.  And he brought her to the chief priests; and they blessed her,
saying:  O God most high, look upon this child, and bless her with the
utmost blessing, which shall be for ever.  And her mother snatched her
up, and took her into the sanctuary of her bed-chamber, and gave her the
breast.  And Anna made a song to the Lord God, saying:  I will sing a
song to the Lord my God, for He hath looked upon me, and hath taken away
the reproach of mine enemies; and the Lord hath given the fruit of His
righteousness, singular in its kind, and richly endowed before Him.  Who
will tell the sons of Rubim that Anna gives suck?  Hear, hear, ye twelve
tribes of Israel, that Anna gives suck.  And she laid her to rest in the
bed-chamber of her sanctuary, and went out and ministered unto them. 
And when the supper was ended, they went down rejoicing, and glorifying
the God of Israel. <span id="fr_1575"></span>[1576](#fn_1575.md)

<span id="vii.iv-p34"></span>7.  And her months were added to the
child.  And the child was two years old, and Joachim said:  Let us take
her up to the temple of the Lord, that we may pay the vow that we have
vowed, lest perchance the Lord send to us, <span
id="fr_1576"></span>[1577](#fn_1576.md) and our offering be not received. 
And Anna said:  Let us wait for the third year, in order that the child
may not seek for father or mother.  And Joachim said:  So let us wait. 
And the child was three years old, and Joachim said:  Invite the
daughters of the Hebrews that are undefiled, and let them take each a
lamp, and let them stand with the lamps burning, that the <span
id="page_363">p. 363</span> <span id="vii.iv-Page_363"></span>child may
not turn back, and her heart be captivated from the temple of the Lord. 
And they did so until they went up into the temple of the Lord.  And the
priest received her, and kissed her, and blessed her, saying:  The Lord
has magnified thy name in all generations.  In thee, on the last of the
days, the Lord will manifest His redemption to the sons of Israel.  And
he set her down upon the third step of the altar, and the Lord God sent
grace upon her; and she danced with her feet, and all the house of
Israel loved her.

<span id="vii.iv-p36"></span>8.  And her parents went down marvelling,
and praising the Lord God, because the child had not turned back.  And
Mary was in the temple of the Lord as if she were a dove that dwelt
there, and she received food from the hand of an angel.  And when she
was twelve <span id="fr_1577"></span>[1578](#fn_1577.md) years old there
was held a council of the priests, saying:  Behold, Mary has reached the
age of twelve years in the temple of the Lord.  What then shall we do
with her, lest perchance she defile the sanctuary of the Lord?  And they
said to the high priest:  Thou standest by the altar of the Lord; go in,
and pray concerning her; and whatever the Lord shall manifest unto thee,
that also will we do.  And the high priest went in, taking the
robe <span id="fr_1578"></span>[1579](#fn_1578.md) with the twelve bells
into the holy of holies; and he prayed concerning her.  And behold an
angel of the Lord stood by him, saying unto him:  Zacharias, Zacharias,
go out and assemble the widowers of the people, and let them bring each
his rod; and to whomsoever the Lord shall show a sign, his wife shall
she be.  And the heralds went out through all the circuit of Judæa, and
the trumpet of the Lord sounded, and all ran.

<span id="vii.iv-p39"></span>9.  And Joseph, throwing away his axe, went
out to meet them; and when they had assembled, they went away to the
high priest, taking with them their rods.  And he, taking the rods of
all of them, entered into the temple, and prayed; and having ended his
prayer, he took the rods and came out, and gave them to them:  but there
was no sign in them, and Joseph took his rod last; and, behold, a dove
came out of the rod, and flew upon Joseph’s head.  And the priest said
to Joseph, Thou hast been chosen by lot to take into thy keeping the
virgin of the Lord.  But Joseph refused, saying:  I have children, and I
am an old man, and she is a young girl.  I am afraid lest I become a
laughing-stock to the sons of Israel.  And the priest said to Joseph: 
Fear the Lord thy God, and remember what the Lord did to Dathan, and
Abiram, and Korah; <span id="fr_1579"></span>[1580](#fn_1579.md) how the
earth opened, and they were swallowed up on account of their
contradiction.  And now fear, O Joseph, lest the same things happen in
thy house.  And Joseph was afraid, and took her into his keeping.  And
Joseph said to Mary:  Behold, I have received thee from the temple of
the Lord; and now I leave thee in my house, and go away to build my
buildings, and I shall come to thee.  The Lord will protect thee.

<span id="vii.iv-p41"></span>10.  And there was a council of the
priests, saying:  Let us make a veil for the temple of the Lord.  And
the priest said:  Call to me the undefiled virgins of the family of
David.  And the officers went away, and sought, and found seven
virgins.  And the priest remembered the child Mary, that she was of the
family of David, and undefiled before God.  And the officers went away
and brought her.  And they brought them into the temple of the Lord. 
And the priest said:  Choose for me by lot who shall spin the gold, and
the white, <span id="fr_1580"></span>[1581](#fn_1580.md) and the fine
linen, and the silk, and the blue, <span
id="fr_1581"></span>[1582](#fn_1581.md) and the scarlet, and the true
purple. <span id="fr_1582"></span>[1583](#fn_1582.md)   And the true purple
and the scarlet fell to the lot of Mary, and she took them, and went
away to her house.  And at that time Zacharias was dumb, and Samuel was
in his place until the time that Zacharias spake.  And Mary took the
scarlet, and span it.

<span id="vii.iv-p45"></span>11.  And she took the pitcher, and went out
to fill it with water.  And, behold, a voice saying:  Hail, thou who
hast received grace; the Lord is with thee; blessed art thou among
women! <span id="fr_1583"></span>[1584](#fn_1583.md)   And she looked
round, on the right hand and on the left, to see whence this voice
came.  And she went away, trembling, to her house, and put down the
pitcher; and taking the purple, she sat down on her seat, and drew it
out.  And, behold, an angel of the Lord stood before her, saying:  Fear
not, Mary; for thou hast found grace before the Lord of all, and thou
shalt conceive, according to His word.  And she hearing, reasoned with
herself, saying:  Shall I conceive by the Lord, the living God? and
shall I bring forth as every woman brings forth?  And the angel of the
Lord said:  Not so, Mary; for the power of the Lord shall overshadow
thee:  wherefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall
be called the Son of the Most High.  And thou shalt call His name Jesus,
for He shall save His people from their sins.  And Mary said:  Behold,
the servant of the Lord before His face:  let it be unto me according to
thy word.

<span id="vii.iv-p47"></span>12.  And she made the purple and the
scarlet, and took them to the priest.  And the priest blessed her, and
said:  Mary, the Lord God hath <span id="page_364">p. 364</span> <span
id="vii.iv-Page_364"></span>magnified thy name, and thou shalt be
blessed in all the generations of the earth.  And Mary, with great joy,
went away to Elizabeth her kinswoman, <span
id="fr_1584"></span>[1585](#fn_1584.md) and knocked at the door.  And when
Elizabeth heard her, she threw away the scarlet, <span
id="fr_1585"></span>[1586](#fn_1585.md) and ran to the door, and opened it;
and seeing Mary, she blessed her, and said:  Whence is this to me, that
the mother of my Lord should come to me? for, behold, that which is in
me leaped and blessed thee. <span id="fr_1586"></span>[1587](#fn_1586.md)  
But Mary had forgotten the mysteries of which the archangel Gabriel had
spoken, and gazed up into heaven, and said:  Who am I, O Lord, that all
the generations of the earth should bless me? <span
id="fr_1587"></span>[1588](#fn_1587.md)   And she remained three months
with Elizabeth; and day by day she grew bigger.  And Mary being afraid,
went away to her own house, and hid herself from the sons of Israel. 
And she was sixteen <span id="fr_1588"></span>[1589](#fn_1588.md) years old
when these mysteries happened.

<span id="vii.iv-p53"></span>13.  And she was in her sixth month; and,
behold, Joseph came back from his building, and, entering into his
house, he discovered that she was big with child.  And he smote <span
id="fr_1589"></span>[1590](#fn_1589.md) his face, <span
id="fr_1590"></span>[1591](#fn_1590.md) and threw himself on the ground
upon the sackcloth, and wept bitterly, saying:  With what face shall I
look upon the Lord my God? and what prayer shall I make about this
maiden? because I received her a virgin out of the temple of the Lord,
and I have not watched over her.  Who is it that has hunted me <span
id="fr_1591"></span>[1592](#fn_1591.md) down?  Who has done this evil thing
in my house, and defiled the virgin?  Has not the history of Adam been
repeated in me?  For just as Adam was in the hour of his singing
praise, <span id="fr_1592"></span>[1593](#fn_1592.md) and the serpent came,
and found Eve alone, and completely deceived her, so it has happened to
me also.  And Joseph stood up from the sackcloth, and called Mary, and
said to her:  O thou who hast been cared for by God, why hast thou done
this and forgotten the Lord thy God?  Why hast thou brought low thy
soul, thou that wast brought up in the holy of holies, and that didst
receive food from the hand of an angel?  And she wept bitterly, saying: 
I am innocent, and have known no man.  And Joseph said to her:  Whence
then is that which is in thy womb?  And she said:  As the Lord my God
liveth, I do not know whence it is to me.

<span id="vii.iv-p58"></span>14.  And Joseph was greatly afraid, and
retired from her, and considered what he should do in regard to
her. <span id="fr_1593"></span>[1594](#fn_1593.md)   And Joseph said:  If I
conceal her sin, I find myself fighting against the law of the Lord; and
if I expose her to the sons of Israel, I am afraid lest that which is in
her be from an angel, <span id="fr_1594"></span>[1595](#fn_1594.md) and I
shall be found giving up innocent blood to the doom of death.  What then
shall I do with her?  I will put her away from me secretly.  And night
came upon him; and, behold, an angel of the Lord appears to him in a
dream, saying:  Be not afraid for this maiden, for that which is in her
is of the Holy Spirit; and she will bring forth a Son, and thou shalt
call His name Jesus, for He will save His people from their sins. <span
id="fr_1595"></span>[1596](#fn_1595.md)   And Joseph arose from sleep, and
glorified the God of Israel, who had given him this grace; and he kept
her.

<span id="vii.iv-p62"></span>15.  And Annas the scribe came to him, and
said:  Why hast thou not appeared in our assembly?  And Joseph said to
him:  Because I was weary from my journey, and rested the first day. 
And he turned, and saw that Mary was with child.  And he ran away to the
priest, <span id="fr_1596"></span>[1597](#fn_1596.md) and said to him: 
Joseph, whom thou didst vouch for, has committed a grievous crime.  And
the priest said:  How so?  And he said:  He has defiled the virgin whom
he received out of the temple of the Lord, and has married her by
stealth, and has not revealed it to the sons of Israel.  And the priest
answering, said:  Has Joseph done this?  Then said Annas the scribe: 
Send officers, and thou wilt find the virgin with child.  And the
officers went away, and found it as he had said; and they brought her
along with Joseph to the tribunal.  And the priest said:  Mary, why hast
thou done this? and why hast thou brought thy soul low, and forgotten
the Lord thy God?  Thou that wast reared in the holy of holies, and that
didst receive food from the hand of an angel, and didst hear the hymns,
and didst dance before Him, why hast thou done this?  And she wept
bitterly, saying:  As the Lord my God liveth, I am pure before Him, and
know not a man.  And the priest said to Joseph:  Why hast thou done
this?  And Joseph said:  As the Lord liveth, I am pure concerning her. 
Then said the priest:  Bear not false witness, but speak the truth. 
Thou hast married her by stealth, and hast not revealed it to the sons
of Israel, and hast not bowed thy head under the strong hand, that thy
seed might be blessed.  And Joseph was silent.

<span id="vii.iv-p64"></span>16.  And the priest said:  Give up the
virgin whom thou didst receive out of the temple of the Lord.  And
Joseph burst into tears.  And the priest said:  I will give you to drink
of the water of the ordeal of the Lord, <span
id="fr_1597"></span>[1598](#fn_1597.md) and He shall make manifest your
sins in your eyes.  And the <span id="page_365">p. 365</span> <span
id="vii.iv-Page_365"></span>priest took the water, and gave Joseph to
drink and sent him away to the hill-country; and he returned unhurt. 
And he gave to Mary also to drink, and sent her away to the
hill-country; and she returned unhurt.  And all the people wondered that
sin did not appear in them.  And the priest said:  If the Lord God has
not made manifest your sins, neither do I judge you.  And he sent them
away.  And Joseph took Mary, and went away to his own house, rejoicing
and glorifying the God of Israel.

<span id="vii.iv-p66"></span>17.  And there was an order from the
Emperor Augustus, that all in Bethlehem of Judæa should be
enrolled. <span id="fr_1598"></span>[1599](#fn_1598.md)   And Joseph said: 
I shall enrol my sons, but what shall I do with this maiden?  How shall
I enrol her?  As my wife?  I am ashamed.  As my daughter then?  But all
the sons of Israel know that she is not my daughter.  The day of the
Lord shall itself bring it to pass <span
id="fr_1599"></span>[1600](#fn_1599.md) as the Lord will.  And he saddled
the ass, and set her upon it; and his son led it, and Joseph
followed. <span id="fr_1600"></span>[1601](#fn_1600.md)   And when they had
come within three miles, Joseph turned and saw her sorrowful; and he
said to himself:  Likely that which is in her distresses her.  And again
Joseph turned and saw her laughing.  And he said to her:  Mary, how is
it that I see in thy face at one time laughter, at another sorrow?  And
Mary said to Joseph:  Because I see two peoples with my eyes; the one
weeping and lamenting, and the other rejoicing and exulting.  And they
came into the middle of the road, and Mary said to him:  Take me down
from off the ass, for that which is in me presses to come forth.  And he
took her down from off the ass, and said to her:  Whither shall I lead
thee, and cover thy disgrace? for the place is desert.

<span id="vii.iv-p70"></span>18.  And he found a cave <span
id="fr_1601"></span>[1602](#fn_1601.md) there, and led her into it; and
leaving his two sons beside her, he went out to seek a widwife in the
district of Bethlehem.

<span id="vii.iv-p72"></span>And I Joseph was walking, and was not
walking; and I looked up into the sky, and saw the sky astonished; and I
looked up to the pole of the heavens, and saw it standing, and the birds
of the air keeping still.  And I looked down upon the earth, and saw a
trough lying, and work-people reclining: and their hands were in the
trough.  And those that were eating did not eat, and those that were
rising did not carry it up, and those that were conveying anything to
their mouths did not convey it; but the faces of all were looking
upwards.  And I saw the sheep walking, and the sheep stood still; and
the shepherd raised his hand to strike them, and his hand remained up. 
And I looked upon the current of the river, and I saw the mouths of the
kids resting on the water and not drinking, and all things in a moment
were driven from their course.

<span id="vii.iv-p73"></span>19.  And I saw a woman coming down from the
hill-country, and she said to me:  O man, whither art thou going?  And I
said:  I am seeking an Hebrew midwife.  And she answered and said unto
me:  Art thou of Israel?  And I said to her:  Yes.  And she said:  And
who is it that is bringing forth in the cave?  And I said:  A woman
betrothed to me.  And she said to me:  Is she not thy wife?  And I said
to her:  It is Mary that was reared in the temple of the Lord, and I
obtained her by lot as my wife.  And yet she is not my wife, but has
conceived of the Holy Spirit.

<span id="vii.iv-p74"></span>And the widwife said to him:  Is this
true?  And Joseph said to her:  Come and see.  And the midwife went away
with him.  And they stood in the place of the cave, and behold a
luminous cloud overshadowed the cave.  And the midwife said:  My soul
has been magnified this day, because mine eyes have seen strange
things—because salvation has been brought forth to Israel.  And
immediately the cloud disappeared out of the cave, and a great light
shone in the cave, so that the eyes could not bear it.  And in a little
that light gradually decreased, until the infant appeared, and went and
took the breast from His mother Mary.  And the midwife cried out, and
said:  This is a great day to me, because I have seen this strange
sight.  And the midwife went forth out of the cave, and Salome met her. 
And she said to her:  Salome, Salome, I have a strange sight to relate
to thee:  a virgin has brought forth—a thing which her nature admits not
of.  Then said Salome:  As the Lord my God liveth, unless I thrust in my
finger, and search the parts, I will not believe that a virgin has
brought forth.

<span id="vii.iv-p75"></span>20.  And the midwife went in, and said to
Mary:  Show thyself; for no small controversy has arisen about thee. 
And Salome put in her finger, and cried out, and said:  Woe is me for
mine iniquity and mine unbelief, because I have tempted the living God;
and, behold, my hand is dropping off as if burned with fire.  And she
bent her knees before the Lord, saying:  O God of my fathers, remember
that I am the seed of Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob; do not make a show
of me to the sons of Israel, but restore me to the poor; for Thou
knowest, O Lord, that in Thy name I have performed my services, and that
I have received my reward at Thy <span id="page_366">p. 366</span> <span
id="vii.iv-Page_366"></span>hand.  And, behold, an angel of the Lord
stood by her, saying to her:  Salome, Salome, the Lord hath heard thee. 
Put thy hand to the infant, and carry it, and thou wilt have safety and
joy.  And Salome went and carried it, saying:  I will worship Him,
because a great King has been born to Israel.  And, behold, Salome was
immediately cured, and she went forth out of the cave justified.  And
behold a voice saying:  Salome, Salome, tell not the strange things thou
hast seen, until the child has come into Jerusalem.

<span id="vii.iv-p76"></span>21.  And, behold, Joseph was ready to go
into Judæa.  And there was a great commotion in Bethlehem of Judæa, for
Magi came, saying:  Where is he that is born king of the Jews? for we
have seen his star in the east, and have come to worship him.  And when
Herod heard, he was much disturbed, and sent officers to the Magi.  And
he sent for the priests, and examined them, saying:  How is it written
about the Christ? where is He to be born?  And they said:  In Bethlehem
of Judæa, for so it is written. <span
id="fr_1602"></span>[1603](#fn_1602.md)   And he sent them away.  And he
examined the Magi, saying to them:  What sign have you seen in reference
to the king that has been born?  And the Magi said:  We have seen a star
of great size shining among these stars, and obscuring their light, so
that the stars did not appear; and we thus knew that a king has been
born to Israel, and we have come to worship him.  And Herod said:  Go
and seek him; and if you find him, let me know, in order that I also may
go and worship him.  And the Magi went out.  And, behold, the star which
they had seen in the east went before them until they came to the cave,
and it stood over the top of the cave.  And the Magi saw the infant with
His mother Mary; and they brought forth from their bag gold, and
frankincense, and myrrh.  And having been warned by the angel not to go
into Judæa, they went into their own country by another road. <span
id="fr_1603"></span>[1604](#fn_1603.md)

<span id="vii.iv-p79"></span>22.  And when Herod knew that he had been
mocked by the Magi, in a rage he sent murderers, saying to them:  Slay
the children <span id="fr_1604"></span>[1605](#fn_1604.md) from two years
old and under.  And Mary, having heard that the children were being
killed, was afraid, and took the infant and swaddled Him, and put Him
into an ox-stall.  And Elizabeth, having heard that they were searching
for John, took him and went up into the hill-country, and kept looking
where to conceal him.  And there was no place of concealment.  And
Elizabeth, groaning with a loud voice, says:  O mountain of God, receive
mother and child.  And immediately the mountain was cleft, and received
her.  And a light shone about them, for an angel of the Lord was with
them, watching over them.

<span id="vii.iv-p81"></span>23.  And Herod searched for John, and sent
officers to Zacharias, saying:  Where hast thou hid thy son?  And he,
answering, said to them:  I am the servant of God in holy things, and I
sit constantly in the temple of the Lord:  I do not know where my son
is.  And the officers went away, and reported all these things to
Herod.  And Herod was enraged, and said:  His son is destined to be king
over Israel.  And he sent to him again, saying:  Tell the truth; where
is thy son? for thou knowest that thy life is in my hand.  And Zacharias
said:  I am God’s martyr, if thou sheddest my blood; for the Lord will
receive my spirit, because thou sheddest innocent blood at the vestibule
of the temple of the Lord.  And Zacharias was murdered about daybreak. 
And the sons of Israel did not know that he had been murdered. <span
id="fr_1605"></span>[1606](#fn_1605.md)

<span id="vii.iv-p83"></span>24.  But at the hour of the salutation the
priests went away, and Zacharias did not come forth to meet them with a
blessing, according to his custom. <span
id="fr_1606"></span>[1607](#fn_1606.md)   And the priests stood waiting for
Zacharias to salute him at the prayer, <span
id="fr_1607"></span>[1608](#fn_1607.md) and to glorify the Most High.  And
he still delaying, they were all afraid.  But one of them ventured to go
in, and he saw clotted blood beside the altar; and he heard a voice
saying:  Zacharias has been murdered, and his blood shall not be wiped
up until his avenger come.  And hearing this saying, he was afraid, and
went out and told it to the priests.  And they ventured in, and saw what
had happened; and the fretwork of the temple made a wailing noise, and
they rent their clothes <span id="fr_1608"></span>[1609](#fn_1608.md) from
the top even to the bottom.  And they found not his body, but they found
his blood turned into stone.  And they were afraid, and went out and
reported to the people that Zacharias had been murdered.  And all the
tribes of the people heard, and mourned, and lamented for him three days
and three nights.  And after the three days, the priests consulted as to
whom they should put in his place; and the lot fell upon Simeon.  For it
was he who had been warned by the Holy Spirit that he should not see
death until he should see the Christ in the flesh. <span
id="fr_1609"></span>[1610](#fn_1609.md)

<span id="vii.iv-p88"></span>And I James that wrote this history in
Jerusalem, a commotion having arisen when Herod died, withdrew myself to
the wilderness until the commotion in Jerusalem ceased, glorifying <span
id="page_367">p. 367</span> <span id="vii.iv-Page_367"></span>the Lord
God, who had given me the gift and the wisdom to write this
history. <span id="fr_1610"></span>[1611](#fn_1610.md)   And grace shall be
with them that fear our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory to ages of

manuscript of the eleventh century (Paris).  At least seventeen other
forms exist.  The book is variously named by ancient writers.  In the
decree of Gelasius (<span class="c9"><span

<span id="vii.iv-p5"></span>The text of Tischendorf, here translated, is
somewhat less diffuse than that of Fabricius, and is based on manuscript

me.

<span id="vii.iv-p69"></span> Another reading is:  And his son Samuel

<span id="vii.iv-p71"></span> Bethlehem…used to be overshadowed by a
grove of Thammuz, i.e., Adonis; and in the cave where Christ formerly
wailed as an infant, they used to mourn for the beloved of Venus
(*Jerome to Paulinus*).  In his letter to Sabinianus the cave is
repeatedly mentioned:  “That cave in which the Son of God was born;”
“that venerable cave,” etc., “within the door of what was once the
Lord’s manger, now the altar.”  “Then you run to the place of the
shepherds.”  There appears also to have been above the altar the figure
of an angel, or angels.  See also Justin, *Tryph*., 78.

<span id="vii.iv-p82"></span> Another reading is:  And Herod, enraged at
this, ordered him to be slain in the midst of the altar before the dawn,
that the slaying of him might not be prevented by the people.  \[This
incident was probably suggested by the reference to “Zacharias the son
of Barachias” in [Matt. 23:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#035.md), [Luke

<span id="vii.iv-p89"></span> \[Assuming that this is among the most
ancient of the Apocryphal Gospels, it is noteworthy that the writer
abstains from elaborating his statements on points fully narrated in the
Canonical Gospels.  The *supplementary* character of the earliest of
these writings is obvious.  But what a contrast between the impressive
silence of the New Testament narratives, and the garrulity, not to say
indelicacy, of these detailed descriptions of the Nativity!—R.\]
