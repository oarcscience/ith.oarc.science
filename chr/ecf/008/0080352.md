<span id="vi.iii.viii.i-p3"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iii.viii.i-p3.1"></span>But</span> as soon as day began to
advance the dawn upon the retiring darkness, Peter having gone into the
garden to pray, and returning thence and coming to us, by way of excuse
for awaking and coming to us a little later than usual, said this: <span
id="fr_773"></span>[774](#fn_773)   “Now that the spring-time has
lengthened the day, of course the night is shorter; if, therefore, one
desires to occupy some portion of the night in study, he must not keep
the same hours <span id="fr_774"></span>[775](#fn_774) for waking at all
seasons, but should spend the same length of time in sleeping, whether
the night be longer or shorter, and be exceedingly careful that he do
not cut off from the period which he is wont to have for study, and so
add to his sleep and lessen his time of keeping awake.  And this also is
to be <span id="page_153">p. 153</span> <span
id="vi.iii.viii.i-Page_153"></span>observed, lest haply if sleep be
interrupted while the food is still undigested, the undigested mass lead
the mind, and by the exhalation of crude spirits render the inner sense
confused and disturbed.  It is right, therefore, that that part also be
cherished with sufficient rest, so that, those things being sufficiently
accomplished which are due to it, the body may be able in other things
to render due service to the mind.”
