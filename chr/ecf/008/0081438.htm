<p class="c21"><a name="viii.viii.iv-p2"></A><span class="c9"><a name="viii.viii.iv-p2.1"></A>It</span> should be borne in mind by the reader that the holy martyr Fabian must not be less esteemed because this forgery was put upon him long after his decease.&#160; The forger puts many good things into his work, to make it accord with the character to which he attributes good and bad together.&#160; So with all the Decretals:&#160; they are made specious by piety and texts of Scripture.</p>
