Constant.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.vi.xiv-p2"></span>“For if it were permitted to any one
who will profess prophecy to have it believed in the cases in which he
was found false, that then he had not the Holy Spirit of foreknowledge,
it will be difficult to convict him of being a false prophet; for among
the many things that he speaks, a few come to pass, and then he is
believed to have the Spirit, although he speaks the first things last,
and the last first; speaks of past events as future, and future as
already past; and also without sequence; or things borrowed from others
and altered, and some that are lessened, unformed, foolish, ambiguous,
unseemly, obscure, proclaiming all unconscientiousness.
