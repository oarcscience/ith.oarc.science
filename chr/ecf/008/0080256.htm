<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.v.xlvi-p2"></A>&#8220;In a similar transaction I see that I am even now engaged.&#160; For as then, when Moses exhorted the king to believe God, the magicians opposed him by a pretended exhibition of similar signs, and so kept back the unbelievers from salvation; so also now, when I have come forth to teach all nations to believe in the true God, Simon the magician resists me, acting in opposition to me, as they also did in opposition to Moses; in order that whosoever they be from among the nations that do not use sound judgment, they may be made manifest; but that those may be saved who rightly distinguish signs from signs.&#8221;&#160; While Peter thus spoke, Niceta answered:&#160; &#8220;I beseech you that you would permit me to state whatever occurs to my mind.&#8221;&#160; Then Peter, being delighted with the eagerness of his disciples, said:&#160; &#8220;Speak what you will.&#8221;</p>
