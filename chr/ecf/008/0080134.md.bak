id="vi.iii.iii.lxxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter LXXII.—Peter Sent to
Cæsarea.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iii.lxxii-p2"></span>“While, therefore, we abode in
Jericho, and gave ourselves to prayer and fasting, James the bishop sent
for me, and sent me here to Cæsarea, saying that Zacchæus had written to
him from Cæsarea, that one Simon, a Samaritan magician, was subverting
many of our people, asserting that he was one *Stans*, <span
id="fr_597"></span>[598](#fn_597.md) —that is, in other words, the Christ,
and the great power of the high God, which is superior to the Creator of
the world; at the same time that he showed many miracles, and made some
doubt, and others fall away to him.  He informed me of all things that
had been ascertained respecting this man from those who had formerly
been either his associates or his disciples, and had afterwards been
converted to Zacchæus.  ‘Many therefore there are, O Peter,’ said James,
‘for whose safety’s sake it behoves you to go and to refute the
magician, and to teach the word of truth.  Therefore make no delay; nor
let it grieve you that you set out alone, knowing that God by Jesus will
go with you, and will help you, and that soon, by His grace, you will
have many associates and sympathizers.  Now be sure that you send me in
writing every year an account of your sayings and doings, and especially
at the end of every seven years.’  With these expressions he dismissed
me, and in six days I arrived at Cæsarea.” <span

It is probable that the author of the *Recognitions* connected the
persecution by Saul and the sorceries of Simon because of the similar
juxtaposition in [Acts viii](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#000.md)<span
