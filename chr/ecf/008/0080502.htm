<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.xi.xxxiii-p2"></A>Then I answered:&#160; &#8220;How know you that she cohabited with her slave abroad, and died in his society?&#8221;&#160; Then the old man said:&#160; &#8220;I know it with perfect certainty; not indeed that she was married to the slave, as indeed I had not even discovered that she loved him.&#160; But after she was gone, my brother gave me the whole story, telling me that first she had loved himself; but he, being honourable as a brother, would not pollute his brother&#146;s bed with the stain of incest.&#160; But she, being both afraid of me, and unable to bear the unhappy reproaches (and yet she should not be blamed for that to which her <span class="c9"><a name="vi.iii.xi.xxxiii-p2.1"></A>Genesis</span> compelled her), pretended a dream, and said to me:&#160; &#145;Some one stood by me in a vision, who ordered me to leave the city without delay with my two twins.&#146;&#160; When I heard this, being anxious for her safety and that of my sons, I immediately sent away her and the children, retaining with myself one who was younger.&#160; For this she said that he had permitted who had given her warning in her sleep.&#8221;</p>
