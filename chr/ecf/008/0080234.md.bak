id="vi.iii.v.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXIV.—Against Order is Against
Reason.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.v.xxiv-p2"></span>“Let such a one then hear this:  The
teaching of all doctrine has a certain order, and there are some things
which must be delivered first, others in the second place, and others in
the third, and so all in their order; and if these things be delivered
in their order, they become plain; but if they be brought forward out of
order, they will seem to be spoken against reason.  And therefore order
is to be observed above all things, if we seek for the purpose of
finding what we seek.  For he who enters rightly upon the road, will
observe the second place in due order, and from the second will more
easily find the third; and the further he proceeds, so much the more
will the way of knowledge become open to him, even until he arrive at
the city of truth, whither he is bound, and which he desires to reach. 
But he who is unskilful, and knows not the way of inquiry, as a
traveller in a foreign country, ignorant and wandering, if he will not
employ a native of the country as a guide,—undoubtedly when he has
strayed from the way of truth, shall remain outside the gates of life,
and so, involved in the darkness of black night, shall walk through the
paths of perdition.  Inasmuch therefore, as, if those things which are
to be sought, be sought in an orderly manner, they can most easily be
found, but the unskilful man is ignorant of the order of inquiry, it is
right that the ignorant man should yield to the knowing one, and first
learn the order of inquiry, that so at length he may find the method of
asking and answering.”
