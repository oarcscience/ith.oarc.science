id="vi.iv.xi.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XV.—The Giants.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xi.xv-p2"></span>“But from their unhallowed intercourse
spurious men sprang, much greater in stature than *ordinary* men, whom
they afterwards called giants; not those dragon-footed giants who waged
war against God, as those blasphemous myths of the Greeks do sing, but
wild in manners, and greater than men in size, inasmuch as they were
sprung of angels; yet less than angels, as they were born of women. 
Therefore God, knowing that they were barbarized to brutality, and that
the world was not sufficient to satisfy them (for it was created
according to the proportion of men and human use), that they might not
through want of food turn, contrary to nature, to the eating of animals,
and yet seem to be blameless, as having ventured upon this through
necessity, the Almighty God rained manna upon them, suited to their
various tastes; and they enjoyed all that they would.  But they, on
account of their bastard nature, not being pleased with purity of food,
longed only after the taste of blood.  Wherefore they first tasted
flesh.
