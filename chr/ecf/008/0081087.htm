<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xx.xiii-p2"></A>Simon, on hearing this, interrupted him, and said:&#160; &#8220;I know against whom you are making these remarks; but in order that I may not spend any time in discussing subjects which I do not wish to discuss, repeating the same statements to refute you, reply to that which is concisely stated by us.&#160; You professed that you had well understood the doctrines and deeds&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1345"></A><A HREF="#fn_1345"><FONT SIZE="1">1346</FONT></A>
 of your teacher because you saw them before you with your own eyes,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1346"></A><A HREF="#fn_1346"><FONT SIZE="1">1347</FONT></A>
 and heard them with your <A NAME="page_322"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 322</FONT></A> <a name="vi.iv.xx.xiii-Page_322"></A>own ears, and that it is not possible for any other to have anything similar by vision or apparition.&#160; But I shall show that this is false.&#160; He who hears any one with his own ears, is not altogether fully assured of the truth of what is said; for his mind has to consider whether he is wrong or not, inasmuch as he is a man as far as appearance goes.&#160; But apparition not merely presents an object to view, but inspires him who sees it with confidence, for it comes from God.&#160; Now reply first to this.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1347"></A><A HREF="#fn_1347"><FONT SIZE="1">1348</FONT></A>
