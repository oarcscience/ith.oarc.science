id="ix.v.vi-p1.1"></span>VI.</span>

<span id="ix.v.vi-p2"></span>*From the departure* <span
id="fr_2950"></span>[2951](#fn_2950.md) *of Marath* <span
id="fr_2951"></span>[2952](#fn_2951.md) *Mary from the world, and the birth
and childhood of our Lord Jesus Christ.  Book the Second.*

<span id="ix.v.vi-p5"></span>In the year three hundred and forty-five,
in the month of the latter Tishrin, <span
id="fr_2952"></span>[2953](#fn_2952.md) Marath Mary went out from her
house, and went to the sepulchre of Christ:  because every day she used
to go and weep there.  But the Jews immediately after the death of
Christ seized the sepulchre, and heaped great stones at the door of it. 
And over the sepulchre and Golgotha they set guards, and commanded them
that, if any one should go and pray at the sepulchre or at Golgotha, he
should immediately be put to death.  And the Jews took away the cross of
our Lord, and those two other crosses, and that spear with which our
Saviour was struck, and those nails which they drove into His hands and
into His feet, and those robes of mockery in which He had been clad; and
they hid them:  lest, as they said, any one of the kings or of the chief
persons should come and inquire concerning the putting to death of
Christ.

<span id="ix.v.vi-p7"></span>And the guards went in and said to the
priests:  Mary cometh in the evening and in the morning, and prayeth
there.  And there was a commotion in Jerusalem on account of Marath
Mary.  And the priests went to the judge, and said to him:  My lord,
send and command Mary that she go not to pray at the sepulchre and at
Golgotha.  And while they were deliberating, lo! letters came from
Abgar, the king of the city of Edessa, to Sabina the procurator <span
id="fr_2953"></span>[2954](#fn_2953.md) who had been appointed by Tiberius
the emperor, and as far as the river Euphrates the procurator Sabina had
authority.  And, because Addæus the apostle, one of the seventy-two
apostles, had gone down and built a church at Edessa, and had cured the
disease with which Abgar the king was afflicted—for Abgar the king loved
Jesus Christ, and was constantly inquiring about Him; and, when Christ
was put to death and Abgar the king heard that the Jews had slain Him on
the cross, he was much displeased; and Abgar arose and rode and came as
far as the river Euphrates, because he wished to go up against Jerusalem
and lay it waste; and, when Abgar came and was arrived at the river
Euphrates, he deliberated in his mind:  If I pass over, there will be
enmity between me and Tiberius the emperor.  And Abgar wrote letters and
sent them to Sabina the procurator, and Sabina sent them to Tiberius the
emperor.  In this manner did Abgar write to Tiberius the emperor:—

<span id="ix.v.vi-p9"></span>“From Abgar, the king of the city of
Edessa.  Much peace to thy Majesty, our lord Tiberius!  In order that
thy Majesty may not be offended with me, I have not passed over the
river Euphrates:  for I have been wishing to go up against Jerusalem and
lay her waste, forasmuch as she has slain Christ, a skilful healer.  But
do thou, as a great sovereign who hast authority over all the earth and
over us, send and do me judgment on the people of Jerusalem.  For be it
known to thy Majesty that I desire that thou wilt do me judgment on the
crucifiers.”

<span id="ix.v.vi-p10"></span>And Sabina received the letters, and sent
them to Tiberius the emperor.  And, when he had read them, Tiberius the
emperor was greatly incensed, and he desired to destroy and slay all the
Jews.  And the people of Jerusalem heard it and were alarmed.  And the
priests went to the governor, and said to him:  My lord, send and
command Mary that she go not to pray at the sepulchre and Golgotha.  The
judge said to the priests:  Go ye yourselves, and give her what command
and what caution ye please.
