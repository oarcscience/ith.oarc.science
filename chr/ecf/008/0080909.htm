<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xiii.ii-p2"></A>&#8220;There seems to me to be a great difference between the ignorant and the erring.&#160; For the ignorant man seems to me to be like a man who does not wish to set out for a richly stored city, through his not knowing the excellent things that are there; but the erring man to be like one who has learned indeed the good things that are in the city, but who has forsaken the highway in proceeding towards it, and so has wandered.&#160; Thus, therefore, it seems to me that there is a great difference between those who worship idols and those who are faulty in the worship of God.&#160; For they who worship idols are ignorant of eternal life, and therefore they do not desire it; for what they do not know, they cannot love.&#160; But those who have chosen to worship one God, and who have learned of the eternal life given to the good, if they either believe or do anything different from what is pleasing to God, are like to those who have gone out from the city of punishment, and are desirous to come to the well-stored city, and on the road have strayed from the right path.&#8221;</p>
