<span id="vi.iv.vii.xiii-p2"></span>“And others introduce an
unforeseeing destiny, as if all things revolved of their own accord,
without the superintendence of any master.  But thus to think these
things is, as we have said, the most grievous of all opinions.  For, as
if there were no one superintending and fore-judging and distributing to
every one according to his deserving, they easily do everything as they
can through fearlessness.  Therefore those who have such opinions do not
easily, or perhaps do not at all, live virtuously; for they do not
foresee the danger which might have the effect of converting them.  But
the doctrine of the barbarous Jews, as you call them, is most pious,
introducing One as the Father and Creator of all this world, by nature
good and righteous; good, indeed, as pardoning sins to those who repent;
but righteous, as visiting to every one after repentance according to
the worthiness of his doings.
