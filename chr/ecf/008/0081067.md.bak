<span id="vi.iv.xix.xv-p2"></span>When Simon heard this, he said: 
“Since you say that we ought not to believe even the prophet that gives
signs and wonders if he say that there is another god, and that you know
that he even incurs the penalty of death, therefore your teacher also
was with reason cut off for having given signs and wonders.”  And Peter
answered:  “Our Lord neither asserted that there were gods except the
Creator of all, nor did He proclaim Himself to be God, but He with
reason pronounced blessed him who called Him the Son of that God who has
arranged the universe.”  And Simon answered:  “Does it not seem to you,
then, that he who comes from God is God?” <span
