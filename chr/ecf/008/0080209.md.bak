id="vi.iii.iv.lxxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter LXXII.—The Remedy.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iv.lxxii-p2"></span>“For these unclean spirits love to
dwell in the bodies of men, that they may fulfil their own desires by
their service, and, inclining the motions of their souls to those things
which they themselves desire, may compel them to obey their own lusts,
that they may become wholly vessels of demons. <span
id="fr_672"></span>[673](#fn_672.md)   One of whom is this Simon, who is
seized with such disease, and cannot now be healed, because he is sick
in his will and purpose.  Nor does the demon dwell in him against his
will; and therefore, if any one would drive it out of him, since it is
inseparable from himself, and, so to speak, has now become his very
soul, he should seem rather to kill him, and to incur the guilt of
manslaughter.  Let no one of you therefore be saddened at being
separated from eating with us, for every one ought to observe that it is
for just so long a time as he <span id="page_117">p. 117</span> <span
id="vi.iii.iv.lxxii-Page_117"></span>pleases.  For he who wishes soon to
be baptized is separated but for a little time, but he for a longer who
wishes to be baptized later.  Every one therefore has it in his own
power to demand a shorter or a longer time for his repentance; and
therefore it lies with you, when you wish it, to come to our table; and
not with us, who are not permitted to take food with any one who has not
been baptized.  It is rather you, therefore, who hinder us from eating
with you, if you interpose delays in the way of your purification, and
defer your baptism.”  Having said thus, and having blessed, he took
food.  And afterwards, when he had given thanks to God, he went into the
house and went to bed; and we all did the like, for it was now night.
