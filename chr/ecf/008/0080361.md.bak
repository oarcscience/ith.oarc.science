id="vi.iii.viii.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter X.—Necessity of Good
Works.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.viii.x-p2"></span>“But when you have been regenerated
by water, show by good works the likeness in you of that Father who hath
begotten you.  Now you know God, honour Him as a father; and His honour
is, that you live according to His will.  And His will is, that you so
live as to know nothing of murder or adultery, to flee from hatred and
covetousness, to put away anger, pride, and boasting, to abhor envy, and
to count all such things entirely unsuitable to you.  There is truly a
certain peculiar observance of our religion, which is not so much
imposed upon men, as it is sought out by every worshipper of God by
reason of its purity.  By reason of chastity, I say, of which there are
many kinds, but first, that every one be careful that he ‘come not near
a menstruous woman;’ for this the law of God regards as detestable.  But
though the law had given no admonition concerning these things, should
we willingly, like beetles, roll ourselves in filth?  For we ought to
have something more than the animals, as reasonable men, and capable of
heavenly senses, whose chief study it ought to be to guard the
conscience from every defilement of the heart.
