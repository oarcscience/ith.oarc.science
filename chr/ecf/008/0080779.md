id="vi.iv.vii.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.—Second Nature.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xviii-p2"></span>“On this account, they who live in
the country sin much less than they do, not having been <span
id="page_255">p. 255</span> <span
id="vi.iv.vii.xviii-Page_255"></span>indoctrinated in those things in
which they have been indoctrinated who dare do these things, having
learned from evil instruction to be impious.  For they who from their
childhood learn letters by means of such fables, while their soul is yet
pliant, engraft the impious deeds of those who are called gods into
their own minds; whence, when they are grown up, they ripen fruit, like
evil seeds cast into the soul.  And what is worst of all, the rooted
impurities cannot be easily cut down, when they are perceived to be
bitter by them when they have attained to manhood.  For every one is
pleased to remain in those habits which he forms in childhood; and thus,
since custom is not much less powerful than nature, they become
difficult to be converted to those good things which were not sown in
their souls from the beginning.
