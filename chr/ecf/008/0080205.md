Invisible Heaven.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iv.lxviii-p2"></span>To this Simon answered:  “It seems
to me to be better to believe simply that God is, and that that heaven
which we see is the only heaven in the whole universe.”  But Peter
said:  “Not so; but it is proper to confess one God who truly is; but
that there are heavens, which were made by Him, as also the law says, of
which one is the higher, in which also is contained the visible
firmament; and that that higher heaven is perpetual and eternal, with
those who dwell in it; but that this visible heaven is to be dissolved
and to pass away at the end of the world, in order that that heaven
which is older and higher may appear after the judgment to the holy and
the worthy.”  To this Simon answered:  “That these things are so, as you
say, may appear to those who believe them; but to him who seeks for
reasons of these things, it is impossible that they can be produced from
the law, and especially concerning the immensity of light.”
