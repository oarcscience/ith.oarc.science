<span id="vi.iv.vii.x-p3"></span> The text here is corrupt.  If we adopt
Lobeck’s emendation of <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.vii.x-p3.1"></span>παμμιούσων</span> into <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.iv.vii.x-p3.2"></span>παμπλουσιον</span>, the
literal translation is, “possessing a property around him continually
rich in leaves.”  \[The offer of this man has a partial parallel in
*Recognitions*, viii. 35–38.—R.\]
