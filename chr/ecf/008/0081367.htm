<p class="c15"><a name="vii.xxxi-p5"></A><span class="c29"><a name="vii.xxxi-p5.1"></A>Acts of the Holy Apostles Peter and Andrew.</span></p> 
<p class="c21"><a name="vii.xxxi-p6"></A><span class="c9"><a name="vii.xxxi-p6.1"></A>It</span> came to pass when Andrew the apostle of Christ went forth from the city of the man-eaters, behold a luminous cloud snatched him up, and carried him away to the mountain where Peter and Matthew and Alexander were sitting.&#160; And when he saw them, they saluted him with great joy.&#160; Then Peter says to him:&#160; What has happened to thee, brother Andrew?&#160; Hast thou sown the word of truth in the country of the man-eaters or not?&#160; Andrew says to him:&#160; Yes, father Peter, through thy prayers; but the men of that city have done me many mischiefs, for they dragged me through their street three days, so that my blood stained the whole street.&#160; Peter says to him:&#160; Be a man in the Lord, brother Andrew, and come hither, and rest from thy labour.&#160; For if the good husbandman laboriously till the ground, it will also bear fruit, and straightway all his toil will be turned into joy; but if he toil, and his land bring forth no fruit, he has double toil.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xxxi-p7"></A>And while he was thus speaking, the Lord Jesus Christ appeared to them in the form of a child, and said to them:&#160; Hail, Peter, bishop of the whole of my Church! hail, Andrew!&#160; My co-heirs, be courageous, and struggle for mankind; for verily I say unto you, you shall endure toils in this world for mankind.&#160; <i>But be bold; I will give you rest</i> in one hour of repose in the kingdom of my Father.&#160; Arise, then, and go into the city of the barbarians, and preach in it; and I will be with you in the wonders that shall happen in it by your hands.&#160; And the Lord Jesus, after saluting them, went up into the heavens in glory.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xxxi-p8"></A>And Peter, and Andrew, and Alexander, and Rufus, and Matthias, went into the city of the barbarians.&#160; And after they had come near the city, Andrew answered and said to Peter:&#160; Father Peter, have we again to undergo toils in this city, as in the country of the man-eaters?&#160; Peter says to him:&#160; I do not know.&#160; But, behold, there is an old man before us sowing in his field:&#160; if we go up to him, let us say to him, Give us bread; and if he give us bread, we may know that we are not to suffer in this city; but if he say to us, We have no bread, on the other hand, we shall know that suffering again awaits us.&#160; And when they came up to the old man, Peter says to him:&#160; Hail, farmer!&#160; And the farmer says to them:&#160; Hail you too, merchants!&#160; Peter says to him:&#160; Have you bread to give to these children, for we have been in want?&#160; The old man says to them:&#160; Wait a little, and look after the oxen, and the plough, and the land, that I may go into the city, and get you loaves.&#160; Peter says to him:&#160; If you provide hospitality for us, we shall took after the cattle and the field.&#160; The old man says:&#160; So be it.&#160; Peter says to him:&#160; Are the oxen your own?&#160; The old man says:&#160; No; I have them on hire.&#160; Peter says to him:&#160; Go into the city.&#160; And the old man went into the city.&#160; And Peter arose, and girded up his cloak and his under-garment, and says to Andrew:&#160; It is not right for us to rest and be idle; above all, when the old man is working for us, having left his own work.&#160; Then Peter took hold of the plough, and sowed the wheat.&#160; And Andrew was behind the oxen, and says to Peter:&#160; Father Peter, why dost thou bring toil upon us, especially when we have work enough already!&#160; Then Andrew took the plough out of Peter&#146;s hand, and sowed the wheat, saying:&#160; O seed cast into the ground in the field of the righteous, come up, and come to the light.&#160; Let the young men of the city therefore come forth, whom I found in the pit of destruction until to-day; for, behold, the apostles of Christ are coming into the city, pardoning the sins of those who believe in them, and healing every disease, and every sickness.&#160; Pray ye for me, that He may have mercy upon me, and that I may be delivered from this strait.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xxxi-p9"></A>And many of the multitude believed in Christ, because of the saying of the woman;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2279"></A><A HREF="#fn_2279"><FONT SIZE="1">2280</FONT></A>
 and they fell at the feet of the apostles, and adored them.&#160; <A NAME="page_527"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 527</FONT></A> <a name="vii.xxxi-Page_527"></A>And they laid their hands upon them.&#160; And they healed those in the city that were sick, and gave sight to the blind and, hearing to the deaf, and drove out the demons.&#160; All the multitude glorified the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xxxi-p11"></A>And there was a certain rich man in the city, by name Onesiphorus.&#160; He, having seen the miracles done by the apostles, says to them:&#160; If I believe in your God, can I also do a miracle like you?&#160; Andrew says to him:&#160; If thou wilt forsake all that belongs to thee, and thy wife and thy children, as we also have done, then thou also shalt do miracles.&#160; When Onesiphorus heard this, he was filled with rage, and took his scarf and threw it over Andrew&#146;s neck, and struck him, and said to him:&#160; Thou art a sorcerer.&#160; How dost thou force me to abandon my wife, and my children, and my goods?&#160; Then Peter, having turned and seen him striking Andrew, says to him:&#160; Man, stop now striking Andrew.&#160; Onesiphorus says to him:&#160; I see that thou art more sensible than he.&#160; Do thou then tell me to leave my wife, and my children, and my goods.&#160; What dost thou say?&#160; Peter says to him:&#160; One thing I say unto thee:&#160; it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to go into the kingdom of heaven.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2280"></A><A HREF="#fn_2280"><FONT SIZE="1">2281</FONT></A>
&#160; When Onesiphorus heard this, he was even more filled with rage and anger, and took his scarf off the neck of Andrew, and threw it upon the neck of Peter; and so he dragged him along, saying:&#160; Verily thou art a great sorcerer, more than the other; for a camel cannot go through the eye of a needle.&#160; But if thou wilt show me this miracle, I will believe in thy God; and not only I, but also the whole city.&#160; But if not, thou shalt be grievously punished in the midst of the city.&#160; And when Peter heard this, he was exceedingly grieved, and stood and stretched forth his hands towards heaven, and prayed, saying:&#160; O Lord our God, listen to me at this time; for they will ensnare us from Thine own words:&#160; for no prophet has spoken to set forth this his explanation, and no patriarch that we might learn the interpretation of it; and now we seek for ourselves the explanation with boldness.&#160; Do Thou then, Lord, not overlook us:&#160; for thou art He who is praised by the cherubim.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xxxi-p13"></A>And after he had said this, the Saviour appeared in the form of a child of twelve years old, wearing a linen garment; and He says to them:&#160; Be courageous, and tremble not, my chosen disciples; for I am with you always.&#160; Let the needle and the camel be brought.&#160; And after saying this, He went up into the heavens.&#160; And there was a certain merchant&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2281"></A><A HREF="#fn_2281"><FONT SIZE="1">2282</FONT></A>
 in the city who had believed in the Lord through the Apostle Philip; and when he heard of this, he ran and searched for a needle with a big eye, to do a favour to the apostles.&#160; When Peter learned this, he said:&#160; My son, do not search for a big needle; for nothing is impossible with God:&#160; rather bring us a small needle.&#160; And after the needle had been brought, and all the multitude of the city were standing by to see, Peter looked up and saw a camel coming.&#160; And he ordered her to be brought.&#160; Then he fixed the needle in the ground, and cried out with a loud voice, saying:&#160; In the name of Jesus Christ, who was crucified under Pontius Pilate, I order thee, O camel, to go through the eye of the needle.&#160; Then the eye of the needle was opened like a gate, and the camel went through it, and all the multitude saw it.&#160; Again Peter says to the camel:&#160; Go again through the needle.&#160; And the camel went a second time.&#160; When Onesiphorus saw this, he said to Peter; Truly thou art a great sorcerer; but I do not believe unless I send and bring a camel and a needle.&#160; And he called one of his servants, and said to him privately:&#160; Go and bring me here a camel and a needle; find also a polluted woman, and force her to come here:&#160; for these men are sorcerers.&#160; And Peter having learned the mystery through the Spirit, says to Onesiphorus:&#160; Send and bring the camel, and the woman, and the needle.&#160; And when they brought them, Peter took the needle, and fixed it in the ground.&#160; And the woman was sitting on the camel. &#160;Then Peter says:&#160; In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ the crucified, I order thee, O camel, to go through this needle.&#160; And immediately the eye of the needle was opened, and became like a gate, and the camel went through it.&#160; Peter again says to the camel:&#160; Go through it again, that all may see the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ, in order that some may believe on Him.&#160; Then the camel again went through the needle.&#160; And Onesiphorus seeing it, cried out, and said:&#160; Truly great is the God of Peter and Andrew, and I from this time forth believe in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.&#160; Now then, hear my words, O Peter.&#160; I have corn lands, vineyards, and fields; I have also twenty-seven pounds of gold, and fifty pounds of silver; and I have very many slaves.&#160; I give my possessions to the poor, that I also may do one miracle like you.&#160; And Peter was grieved lest the powers should not work in him, seeing that he had not received the seal in Christ.&#160; And while he was considering this, behold, a voice out of the heaven saying to him:&#160; Do to him what he wishes, because I will accomplish for him what he desires.&#160; Peter says to him:&#160; My son, come hither; do as we do.&#160; And Onesiphorus came up, and stood before the camel and the needle, and said:&#160; In the n&#8230; (Here the <span class="c9"><a name="vii.xxxi-p14.2"></A>ms.</span> ends.)</p>
