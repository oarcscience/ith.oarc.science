<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.iv.xix-p2"></A>&#8220;Now the Man who is the helper I call the true Prophet; and He alone is able to enlighten the souls of men, so that with our own eyes we may be able to see the way of eternal salvation.&#160; But otherwise it is impossible, as you also know, since you said a little while ago that every doctrine is set up and pulled down, and the same is <A NAME="page_228"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 228</FONT></A> <a name="vi.iv.iv.xix-Page_228"></A>thought true or false, according to the power of him who advocates it; so that doctrines do not appear as they are, but take the appearance of being or not being truth or falsehood from those who advocate them.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_913"></A><A HREF="#fn_913"><FONT SIZE="1">914</FONT></A>
&#160; On this account the whole business of religion needed a true prophet, that he might tell us things that are, as they are, and how we must believe concerning all things.&#160; So that it is first necessary to test the prophet by every prophetic sign, and having ascertained that he is true, thereafter to believe him in every thing, and not to sit in judgment upon his several sayings, but to receive them as certain, being accepted indeed by seeming faith, yet by sure judgment.&#160; For by our initial proof, and by strict inquiry on every side, all things are received with right reason.&#160; Wherefore before all things it is necessary to seek after the true Prophet, because without Him it is impossible that any certainty can come to men.&#8221;</p>
