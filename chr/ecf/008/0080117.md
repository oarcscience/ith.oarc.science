id="vi.iii.iii.lv-p1.1"></span>Chapter LV.—Public Discussion.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iii.lv-p2"></span>“However, as we were proceeding to
say, when the high priest had often sent priests to ask us that we might
discourse with one another concerning Jesus; when it seemed a fit
opportunity, and it pleased all the Church, we went up to the temple,
and, standing on the steps together with our faithful brethren, the
people kept perfect silence; and first the high priest began to exhort
the people that they should hear patiently and quietly, and at the same
time witness and judge of those things that were to be spoken.  Then, in
the next place, exalting with many praises the rite or sacrifice which
had been bestowed by God upon the human race for the remission of sins,
he found fault with the baptism of our Jesus, as having been recently
brought in in opposition to the sacrifices.  But Matthew, <span
id="fr_586"></span>[587](#fn_586.md) meeting his propositions, showed
clearly, that whosoever shall not obtain the baptism of Jesus shall not
only be deprived of the kingdom of heaven, but shall not be without
peril at the resurrection of the dead, even though he be fortified by
the prerogative of a good life and an upright disposition.  Having made
these and such like statements, Matthew stopped.”
