<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.vi.xi-p2"></A>&#8220;By the most righteous judgment of God, therefore, labours and afflictions are assigned as a remedy to men languishing in the vanity of such thoughts.&#160; And when labour and tribulations came upon them, they were excluded from the place of delights and amenity.&#160; Also the earth began to produce nothing to them without labour; and then men&#146;s thoughts being turned in them, they were warned to seek the aid of their Creator, and by prayers and vows to ask for the divine protection.&#160; And thus it came to pass, that the worship of God, which they had neglected by reason of their prosperity, they recovered through their adversity; and their thoughts towards God, which indulgence had perverted, affliction corrected.&#160; So therefore the divine providence, seeing that this was more profitable to man, removed from them the ways of benignity and abundance, as being hurtful, and introduced the way of vexation and tribulation.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_729"></A><A HREF="#fn_729"><FONT SIZE="1">730</FONT></A>
