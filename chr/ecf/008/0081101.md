Revelation.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxi.vi-p2"></span>And Peter said:  “If this is the case,
you are acting most impiously.  For if it belongs to the Son, who
arranged heaven and earth, to reveal His unrevealed Father to whomsoever
He wishes, you are, as I said, acting most impiously in revealing Him to
those to whom He has not revealed Him.”  And Simon said:  “But he
himself wishes me to reveal him.”  And Peter said:  “You do not
understand what I mean, Simon.  But listen and understand.  When it is
said that the Son will reveal Him to whom He wishes, it is meant that
such an one is to learn of Him not by instruction, but by revelation
only.  For it is revelation when that which lies secretly veiled in all
the hearts of men is revealed *unveiled* by His *God’s* own will without
any utterance.  And thus knowledge comes to one, not because he has been
instructed, but because he has understood.  And yet the person who
understands it cannot demonstrate it to another, since he did not
himself receive it by instruction; nor can he reveal it, since he is not
himself the Son, unless he maintains that he is himself the Son.  But
you are not the standing Son.  For if you were the Son, assuredly you
would know those who are worthy of such a revelation.  But you do not
know them.  For if you knew them, you would do as they do who know.”
