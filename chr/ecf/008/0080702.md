id="vi.iv.vi.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XV.—Christ’s Prophecies.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.vi.xv-p2"></span>“But our Master did not prophesy after
this fashion; but, as I have already said, being a prophet by an inborn
and ever-flowing Spirit, and knowing all things at all times, He
confidently set forth, plainly as I said before, sufferings, places,
appointed times, manners, limits.  Accordingly, therefore, prophesying
concerning the temple, He said:  ‘See ye these buildings?  Verily I say
to you, There shall not be left here one stone upon another which shall
not be taken away; and this generation shall not pass until the
destruction begin.  For they shall come, and shall sit here, and shall
besiege it, and shall slay your children here.’ <span
id="fr_957"></span>[958](#fn_957)   And in like manner He spoke in plain
words the things that were straightway to happen, which we can now see
with our eyes, in order that the accomplishment might be among those to
whom the word was spoken.  For the Prophet of truth utters the word of
proof in order to the faith of His hearers.
