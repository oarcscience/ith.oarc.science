id="vi.iii.v.l-p1.1"></span>Chapter LX.—Uselessness of Pretended
Miracles.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.v.l-p2"></span>“For tell me, I pray you, what is the
use of showing statues walking, dogs of brass or stone barking,
mountains dancing, of flying through the air, and such like things,
which you say that Simon did?  But those *signs* which are of the good
One, are directed to the advantage of men, as are those which were done
by our Lord, who gave sight to the blind and hearing to the deaf, raised
up the feeble and the lame, drove away sicknesses and demons, raised the
dead, and did other like things, as you see also that I do.  Those
signs, therefore, which make for the benefit of men, and confer some
good upon them, the wicked one cannot do, excepting only at the end of
the world.  For then it shall be permitted him to mix up with his signs
some good ones, as the expelling of demons or the healing of diseases;
by this means going beyond his bounds, and being divided against
himself, and fighting against himself, he shall be destroyed.  And
therefore the Lord has foretold, that in the last times there shall be
such temptation, that, if it be possible, the very elect shall be
deceived; that is to say, that by the marks of signs being confused,
even those must be disturbed who seem to be expert in discovering
spirits and distinguishing miracles.
