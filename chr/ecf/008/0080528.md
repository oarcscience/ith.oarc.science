<span id="vi.iii.xii.xx-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iii.xii.xx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XX.—Doings of Jupiter.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.xii.xx-p2"></span>“But enough of the old wife’s fables
and genealogy of the Gentiles; for it were endless if I should set forth
all the generations of those whom they call gods, and their wicked
doings.  But by way of example, omitting the rest, I shall detail the
wicked deeds of him only whom they hold to be the greatest and the
chief, and whom they call Jupiter. <span
id="fr_863"></span>[864](#fn_863)   For they say that he possesses
heaven, as being superior to the rest; and he, as soon as he grew up,
married his own sister, whom they call Juno, in which truly he at once
becomes like a beast.  Juno bears Vulcan; but, as they relate, Jupiter
was not his father.  However, by Jupiter himself she became mother of
Medea; and Jupiter having received a response that one who should be
born of her should be more powerful than himself, and should expel him
from his kingdom, took her and devoured her.  Again Jupiter produced
Minerva from his brain, and Bacchus from his thigh.  After this, when he
had fallen in love with Thetis, they say <span id="page_198">p.
198</span> <span id="vi.iii.xii.xx-Page_198"></span>that Prometheus
informed him that, if he lay with her, he who should be born of her
should be more powerful than his father; and for fear of this, he gave
her in marriage to one Peleus.  Subsequently he had intercourse with
Persephone, who was his own daughter by Ceres and by her he begot
Dionysius, <span id="fr_864"></span>[865](#fn_864) who was torn in
pieces by the Titans.  But calling to mind, it is said, that perhaps his
own father Saturn might beget another son, who might be more powerful
than himself, and might expel him from the kingdom, he went to war with
his father, along with his brothers the Titans; and having beaten them,
he at last threw his father into prison, and cut off his genitals, and
threw them into the sea.  But the blood which flowed from the wound,
being mixed with the waves, and turned into foam by the constant
churning, produced her whom they call Aphrodite, and whom with us they
call Venus.  From his intercourse with her who was thus his own sister,
they say that this same Jupiter begot Cypris, who, they say, was the
mother of Cupid.

subsequently in the text for Dionysus the Greek god corresponding to the
Latin Bacchus.  Some of the other names are more or less corrupt forms.
