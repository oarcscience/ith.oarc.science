id="vi.iv.xiii.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIX.—God’s Peculiar
Attribute.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xiii.xix-p2"></span>“He who would worship God ought
before all things to know what alone is peculiar to the nature of God,
which cannot pertain to another, that, looking at His peculiarity, and
not finding it in any other, he may not be seduced into ascribing
godhead to another.  But this is peculiar to God, that He alone is, as
the Maker of all, so also the best of all.  That which makes is indeed
superior in power to that which is made; that which is boundless is
superior in magnitude to that which is bounded:  in respect of beauty,
that which is comeliest; in respect of happiness, that which is most
blessed; in respect of understanding, that which is most perfect.  And
in like manner, in other respects, He has incomparably the
pre-eminence.  Since then, as I said, this very thing, viz., to be the
best of all, is peculiar to God, and the all-comprehending world was
made by Him, none of the things made by Him can come into equal
comparison with Him.
