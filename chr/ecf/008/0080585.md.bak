id="vi.iv.ii.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II.—Misrepresentation of Peter’s
Doctrine.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.ii.ii-p2"></span>In order, therefore, that the like may
also happen to those among us as to these Seventy, give the books of my
preachings to our brethren, with the like mystery of initiation, that
they may indoctrinate those who wish to take part in teaching; for if it
be not so done, our word of truth will be rent into many opinions.  And
this I know, not as being a prophet, but as already seeing the beginning
of this very evil.  For some from among the Gentiles have rejected my
legal preaching, attaching themselves to certain lawless and trifling
preaching of the man who is my enemy. <span
id="fr_889"></span>[890](#fn_889.md)   And these things some have attempted
while I am still alive, to transform my words by certain various
interpretations, in order to the dissolution of the law; as though I
also myself were of such a mind, but did not freely proclaim it, which
God forbid!  For such a thing were to act in opposition to the law of
God which was spoken by Moses, and was borne witness to by our Lord in
respect of its eternal continuance; for thus he spoke:  “The heavens and
the earth shall pass away, but one jot or one tittle shall in no wise
pass from the law.” <span id="fr_890"></span>[891](#fn_890.md)  And this He
has said, that all things might come to pass.  But these men,
professing, I know not how, to know my mind, undertake to explain my
words, which they have heard of me, more intelligently than I who spoke
them, telling their catechumens that this is my meaning, which indeed I
never thought of.  But if, while I am still alive, they dare thus to
misrepresent me, how much more will those who shall come after me dare
to do so!
