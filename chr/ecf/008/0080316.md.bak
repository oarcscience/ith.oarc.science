id="vi.iii.vii.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II.—Suffering the Effect of
Sin.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.vii.ii-p2"></span>“God, the Creator of all, at the
beginning made man after His own image, and gave him dominion over the
earth and sea, and over the air; as the true Prophet has told us, and as
the very reason of things instructs us: for man alone is rational, and
it is fitting that reason should rule over the irrational.  At first,
therefore, while he was still righteous, he was superior to all
disorders and all frailty; but when he sinned, as we taught you
yesterday, and became the servant of sin, he became at the same time
liable to frailty.  This therefore is written, that men may know that,
as by impiety they have been made liable to suffer, so by piety they may
be made free from suffering; and not only free from suffering, but by
even a little faith in God be able to cure the sufferings of others. 
For thus the true Prophet promised us, saying, ‘Verily I say to you,
that if ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say to this
mountain, Remove hence, and it shall remove.’ <span
id="fr_751"></span>[752](#fn_751.md)   Of this saving you have yourselves
also had proofs; for you saw yesterday how at our presence the demons
removed and were put to flight, with those sufferings which they had
brought upon men.
