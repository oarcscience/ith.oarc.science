<span id="vi.iii.xii.vi-p2"></span>“But I should like that one of you,
and not Peter, should answer what I have said; for it is not fitting to
take words and instruction at his hand, with questions; but when he
gives a deliverance on any subject, that should be held without
answering again.  And therefore let us keep him as an umpire; so that if
at any time our discussion does not come to an issue, he may declare
what seems good to him, and so give an undoubted end to doubtful
matters.  And now therefore I could believe, content with his sole
opinion, if he expressed any opinion; and this is what I shall do at
last.  Yet I wish first to see if it is possible by discussion to find
what is sought.  My wish therefore is, that Clement should begin first,
and should show if there is any good or evil in substance or in
actions.”
