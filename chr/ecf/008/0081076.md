id="vi.iv.xx.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II.—Simon’s Speech Against
Peter.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xx.ii-p2"></span>Now he said:  “He accuses you, Peter,
of being the servant of wickedness, of having great power in magic, and
as charming the souls of men in a way worse than idolatry. <span
id="fr_1314"></span>[1315](#fn_1314)   To prove that you are a magician,
he seemed to me to adduce the following evidence, saying:  ‘I am
conscious of this, that when I come to hold a discussion with him, I do
not remember a single word of what I have been meditating on by myself. 
For while he is discoursing, and my mind is engaged in recollecting what
it is that I thought of saying on coming to a conference with him, I do
not hear anything whatsoever of what he is saying.  Now, since I do not
experience this in the presence of any other than in his alone, is it
not plain that I am under the influence of his magic?  And as to his
doctrines being worse than those of idolatry, I can make that quite
clear to any one who has understanding.  For there is no other benefit
than this, that the soul should be freed from images <span
id="fr_1315"></span>[1316](#fn_1315) of every kind.  For when the soul
brings an image before its eye, it is bound by fear, and it pines away
through anxiety lest it should suffer some calamity; and being altered,
it falls under the influence of a demon; and being under his influence,
it seems to the mass to be wise.
