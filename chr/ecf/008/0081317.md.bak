<span id="vii.xv.xvii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vii.xv.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 16.</span>

<span id="vii.xv.xvii-p2"></span>And the rulers of the synagogue, and
the priests and the Levites, hearing these words from Joseph, became as
it were dead, and fell to the ground, and fasted until the ninth hour. 
And Joseph and Nicodemus entreated them, saying:  Arise and stand upon
your feet, and taste bread, and comfort your souls, seeing that
to-morrow is the Sabbath of the Lord.  And they arose, and entreated the
Lord, and ate and drank, and went every man to his own house.

<span id="vii.xv.xvii-p3"></span>And on the Sabbath the teachers and
doctors sat questioning each other, and saying:  What is this wrath that
has come upon us? because we know his father and mother.  Levi the
teacher said:  I know that his parents fear God, and never depart from
prayer, and give tithes thrice a-year.  And when Jesus was born, his
parents <span id="page_447">p. 447</span> <span
id="vii.xv.xvii-Page_447"></span>brought him up to this place, and gave
to God sacrifices and burnt-offerings.  And assuredly the great teacher
Simeon took him into his arms, saying:  Now Thou sendest away Thy
servant, O Lord, according to Thy word, in peace; for mine eyes have
seen Thy salvation, which Thou hast prepared before the face of all
peoples, a light for the revealing of the nations, and the glory of Thy
people Israel.  And he blessed Mary his mother, and said, I make an
announcement to thee concerning this child.  And Mary said, Well, my
lord. <span id="fr_1969"></span>[1970](#fn_1969.md)   And Simeon said,
Well.  And he said again, Lo, he has been set for the fall and rising
again of many in Israel, and for a sign which shall be spoken against;
and a sword shall pierce thine own soul, that the thoughts of many
hearts may be revealed.

<span id="vii.xv.xvii-p5"></span>And the Jews said to Levi:  And how
knowest thou these things?  Levi says:  Do you not know that from him I
learned the law?  They of the council say:  We wish to see thy father. 
And they searched out his father, and got information; for he said:  Why
did you not believe my son?  The blessed and just Simeon taught him the
law.  The council says to Rabbi Levi:  The saying which thou hast spoken
is true.  The chief priests and rulers of the synagogue, and Levites,
said to each other:  Come, let us send into Galilee to the three men who
came hither and gave an account of his teaching and his being taken up,
and let them tell us how they saw him taken up into heaven.  And that
saying pleased all.  Then they sent three men into Galilee; and Go, said
they, say to Rabbi Addas and Rabbi Finees and Rabbi Egias, Peace to you
and yours!  Many investigations have been made in the council concerning
Jesus; therefore have we been instructed to call you to the holy place,
to Jerusalem.

<span id="vii.xv.xvii-p6"></span>The men went to Galilee, and found them
sitting, and meditating on the law.  And they saluted them in peace. 
And they said:  Why have you come?  The messengers said:  The council
summon you to the holy city Jerusalem.  And the men, hearing that they
were sought for by the council, prayed to God, and reclined with the
men, and ate and drank with them.  And rising in the morning, they went
to Jerusalem in peace.

<span id="vii.xv.xvii-p7"></span>And on the morrow the council sat; and
they questioned them, saying:  Did you plainly see Jesus sitting on
Mount Mambre teaching his disciples, and taken up into heaven?

<span id="vii.xv.xvii-p8"></span>First Addas the teacher says:  I really
saw him sitting on Mount Mambre teaching his disciples; and a shining
cloud overshadowed him and his disciples, and he went up into heaven;
and his disciples prayed upon their faces on the ground.  And calling
Finees the priest, they questioned him also, saying:  How didst thou see
Jesus taken up?  And he said the same as the other.  And again they
called the third, Rabbi Egias, and questioned him, and he said the same
as the first and second.  And those who were in the council said:  The
law of Moses holds that by the mouth of two or three every word should
stand.  Abudem, a teacher, one of the doctors, says:  It is written in
the law, Enoch walked with God, and was translated; for God took him. 
Jairus, a teacher, said:  And we have heard of the death of holy Moses,
and have not seen *it*; for it is written in the law of the Lord, And
Moses died according to the word <span
id="fr_1970"></span>[1971](#fn_1970.md) of the Lord, and no man knoweth of
his burying even to the present day.  Rabbi Levi said:  What is it that
Rabbi Simeon said:  Lo, he lies for the fall and rising again of many in
Israel, and for a sign which shall be spoken against?  Rabbi Isaac
said:  It is written in the law, Lo, I send mine angel, who shall go
before thy face to keep thee in every good way, because I have brought
his <span id="fr_1971"></span>[1972](#fn_1971.md) new name.

<span id="vii.xv.xvii-p11"></span>Then Annas and Caiaphas said:  Rightly
have ye said that these things are written in the law of Moses, that no
one saw the death of Enoch, and no one has named the burying of holy
Moses.  And Jesus gave account to <span
id="fr_1972"></span>[1973](#fn_1972.md) Pilate, and we saw him scourged,
and receiving spitting on his face; and the soldiers put a crown of
thorns on him, and he received sentence from Pilate; and then he was
crucified, and they gave him gall and vinegar to drink, and two robbers
were crucified with him, and the soldier Longinus pierced his side with
a lance; and our honourable father Joseph begged his body, and he has
risen again, and, as they say, the three teachers have seen him taken up
into heaven.  And Rabbi Levi has borne witness to what was said by
Simeon the elder—that he has been set for the fall and rising again of
many in Israel, and for a sign which shall be spoken against.

<span id="vii.xv.xvii-p13"></span>Then Didas, a teacher, said to all the
assembly:  If all the things which these have borne witness to have come
to pass in Jesus, they are from God, and let it not be wonderful in our
eyes. <span id="fr_1973"></span>[1974](#fn_1973.md)   The chiefs of the
synagogue, and the priests and the Levites, said to each other how our
law holds, saying:  His name shall be blessed for ever:  His place
endureth before the sun, and His seat before the moon:  and all the
tribes of earth shall be blessed in Him, and all nations shall serve
Him; and kings shall come from far, adoring and magnifying Him. <span
