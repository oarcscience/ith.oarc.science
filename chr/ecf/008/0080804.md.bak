Constellations.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.viii.xvii-p2"></span>“‘For reckon to me how many
mistresses they have rewarded, some of whom they have placed among the
stars; and of some they have blessed both the children and the
associates.  Thus Zeus made Callisto a constellation, called the Little
Bear, which some also call the Dog’s Tail.  Poseidon also placed the
dolphin in the sky for the sake of Amphitrite; and he gave a place among
the stars to Orion the son of Euryale, the daughter of Minos, for the
sake of his mother Euryale.  And Dionysus made a constellation of the
crown of Ariadne, and Zeus invested the eagle which assisted him in the
rape of Ganymede, and Ganymede himself with the honour of the
Water-pourer.  Also he honoured the bull for the sake of Europa; and
also having bestowed Castor, and Polydeuces, and Helena upon Leda, he
made them stars.  Also Perseus for the sake of Danae; and Arcus for the
sake of Callisto.  The virgin who also is Dice, for the sake of Themis;
and Heracles for the sake of Alcmene.  But I do not enlarge further; for
it were long to tell particularly how many others the gods have blessed
for the sake of their many mistresses. in their intercourse with human
beings, which senseless men repudiate as evil <span id="page_260">p.

that pleasure is the great advantage among men.
