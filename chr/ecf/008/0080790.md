<span id="vi.iv.viii.iii-p2"></span>“I knowing this before concerning
Appion, as soon as he asked me the cause of my sickness, answered
feignedly, that I was suffering and distressed in my mind after the
manner of young men.  And to this he said, ‘My son, speak freely as to a
father:  what is your soul’s ailment?’  And when I again groaned
feignedly, as being ashamed to speak of love, by means of silence and
down-looking I conveyed the impression of what I wished to intimate. 
But he, being persuaded that I was in love with a woman, said:  ‘There
is nothing in life which does not admit of help.  For indeed I myself,
when I was young, being in love with a most accomplished woman, not only
thought it impossible to obtain her, but did not even hope ever to
address her.  And yet, having fallen in with a certain Egyptian who was
exceedingly well versed in magic, and having become his friend, I
disclosed to him my love, and not only did he assist me in all that I
wished, but, honouring me more bountifully, he hesitated not to teach me
an incantation by means of which I obtained her; and as soon as I had
obtained her, by means of his secret instruction, being persuaded by the
liberality of my teacher, I was cured of love.
