<span id="vi.iv.xxii.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.xxii.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XV.—Sin the Cause of Evil.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxii.xv-p2"></span>And Simon said:  “But what if, being
lifeless, it possesses a nature capable of producing what is evil and
what is good?”  And Peter said:  “According to this statement, it is
neither good nor evil, because it does not act by free choice, being
lifeless and insensible.  Wherefore it is possible to perceive
distinctly in this matter, how, being lifeless, it produces as if it
were liv<span id="page_335">p. 335</span> <span
id="vi.iv.xxii.xv-Page_335"></span>ing; <span
id="fr_1436"></span>[1437](#fn_1436.md) and being insensible, it yet
plainly fashions artistic shapes both in animals and plants.”  And Simon
said:  “What! if God Himself gave it life, is not He, then, the cause of
the evils which it produces?”  And Peter said:  “If God gave it life
according to His own will, then it is His Spirit that produces it, and
no longer is it anything hostile to God, or of equal power with Him; or
it is impossible that everything made by Him is made according as He
wishes.  But you will say, He Himself is the cause of evil, since He
Himself produces the evils through it.  What sort, then, are the evils
of which you speak?  Poisonous serpents and deadly plants, or demons, or
any other of those things that can disturb men?—which things would not
have been injurious had not man sinned, for which reason <span
id="fr_1437"></span>[1438](#fn_1437.md) death came in.  For if man were
sinless, the poison of serpents would have no effect, nor the activities
of injurious plants, nor would there be the disturbances of demons, nor
would man naturally have any other suffering; but losing his immortality
on account of his sin, he has become, as I said, capable of every
suffering.  But if you say, Why, then, was the nature of man made at the
beginning capable of death? I tell you, because of free-will; for if we
were not capable of death, we could not, as being immortal, be punished
on account of our voluntary sin. <span
id="fr_1438"></span>[1439](#fn_1438.md)   And thus, on account of our
freedom from suffering, righteousness would be still more weakened if we
were wicked by choice; for those who should have evil purposes could not
be punished, on account of their being incapable of suffering. <span
