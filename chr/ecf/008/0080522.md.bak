id="vi.iii.xii.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIV.—No Man Has Universal
Knowledge.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.xii.xiv-p2"></span>Then Peter said:  “These things come
not only from envy or indignation; but sometimes there is a bashfulness
in some persons, lest haply they may not be able to answer fully the
questions that may be proposed, and so they avoid the discovery of their
want of skill.  But no one ought to be ashamed of this, because there is
no man who ought to profess that he knows all things; for there is only
One who knows all things, even He who also made all things.  For if our
Master declared that He knew not the day and the hour whose signs even
He foretold, and referred the whole to the Father, how shall we account
it disgraceful to confess that we are ignorant of some things, since in
this we have the example of our Master?  But this only we profess, that
we know those things which we have learned from the true Prophet; and
that those things have been delivered to us by the true Prophet, which
He judged to be sufficient for human knowledge.”
