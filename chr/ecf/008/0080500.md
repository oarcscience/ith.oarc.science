<span id="vi.iii.xi.xxxi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iii.xi.xxxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXI.—Value of Knowledge.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.xi.xxxi-p2"></span>“And therefore, if we desire
salvation, we ought above all to seek after knowledge, being sure that
if our mind remain in ignorance, we shall endure not only the evils of
*genesis*, but also whatever other evils from without the demons may
please, unless fear of laws and of the judgment to come resist all our
desires, and check the violence of sinning.  For even human fear does
much good, and also much evil, unknown to <span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iii.xi.xxxi-p2.1"></span>Genesis</span>, as we have shown above. 
Therefore our mind is subject to errors in a threefold manner:  from
those things which come to us through evil custom; or from those lusts
which the body naturally stirs up in us; or from those which hostile
powers compel us to.  But the mind has it in its own nature to oppose
and fight against these, when the knowledge of truth shines upon it, by
which knowledge is imparted fear of the judgment to come, which is a fit
governor of the mind, and which can recall it from the precipices of
lusts.  That these things, therefore, are in our power, has been
sufficiently stated.
