<span id="vii.v.xvii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vii.v.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 16.</span>

<span id="vii.v.xvii-p2"></span>And when the second year was past, <span
id="fr_1651"></span>[1652](#fn_1651.md) Magi came from the east to
Jerusalem, bringing great gifts.  And they made strict inquiry of the
Jews, saying:  Where is the king who has been born to you? for we have
seen his star in the east, and have come to worship him.  And word of
this came to King Herod, and so alarmed him that he called together the
scribes and the Pharisees, and the teachers of the people, asking of
them where the prophets had foretold that Christ should be born.  And
they said:  In Bethlehem of Judah.  For it is written:  And thou
Bethelehem, in the land of Judah, art by no means the least among the
princes of Judah; for out of thee shall come forth a Leader who shall
<span id="page_376">p. 376</span> <span
id="vii.v.xvii-Page_376"></span>rule my people Israel. <span
id="fr_1652"></span>[1653](#fn_1652.md)   Then King Herod summoned the magi
to him, and strictly inquired of them when the star appeared to them. 
Then, sending them to Bethlehem, he said:  Go and make strict inquiry
about the child; and when ye have found him, bring me word again, that I
may come and worship him also.  And while the magi were going on their
way, there appeared to them the star, which was, as it were, a guide to
them, going before them until they came to where the child was.  And
when the magi saw the star, they rejoiced with great joy; and going into
the house, they saw the child Jesus sitting in His mother’s lap.  Then
they opened their treasures, and presented great gifts to the blessed
Mary and Joseph.  And to the child Himself they offered each of them a
piece of gold. <span id="fr_1653"></span>[1654](#fn_1653.md)   And likewise
one gave gold, another frankincense, and the third myrrh. <span
id="fr_1654"></span>[1655](#fn_1654.md)   And when they were going to
return to King Herod, they were warned by an angel in their sleep not to
go back to Herod; and they returned to their own country by another
road. <span id="fr_1655"></span>[1656](#fn_1655.md)
