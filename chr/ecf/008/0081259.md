<span id="vii.xii.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vii.xii.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 6.</span>

<span id="vii.xii.vii-p2"></span>One of the Jews, stepping up, asked
leave of the procurator to say a word.  The procurator says:  If thou
wishest to say any thing, say on.  And the Jew said:  Thirty-eight years
I lay in my bed in great agony.  And when Jesus came, many demoniacs,
and many lying ill of various diseases, were cured by him.  And some
young men, taking pity on me, carried me, bed and all, and took me to
him.  And when Jesus saw me, he had compassion on me, and said to me: 
Take up thy couch and walk.  And I took up my couch, and walked.  The
Jews say to Pilate:  Ask him on what day it was that he was cured.  He
that had been cured says:  On a Sabbath. <span
id="fr_1823"></span>[1824](#fn_1823)   The Jews say:  Is not this the
very thing that we said, that on a Sabbath he cures and casts out
demons?

<span id="vii.xii.vii-p4"></span>And another Jew stepped up and said:  I
was born blind; I heard sounds, but saw not a face.  And as Jesus passed
by, I cried out with a loud voice, Pity me, O son of David.  And he
pitied me, and put his hands upon my eyes, and I instantly received my
sight. <span id="fr_1824"></span>[1825](#fn_1824)   And another Jew
stepped up and said:  I was crooked, and he straightened me with a
word.  And another said:  I was a leper, and he cured me with a
word. <span id="fr_1825"></span>[1826](#fn_1825)
