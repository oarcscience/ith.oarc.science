<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xv.viii-p2"></A>Then Peter inquired, &#8220;Are you really, then, alone in your family?&#8221;&#160; Then I answered, &#8220;There are indeed many and great men, being of the kindred of C&aelig;sar.&#160; Wherefore C&aelig;sar himself gave a wife of his own family to my father, who was his foster-brother; and of her three sons of us were born, two before me, who were twins and very like each other, as my father told me.&#160; But I scarcely know either them or our mother, but bear about with me an obscure image of them, as through dreams.&#160; My mother&#146;s name was Mattidia, and my father&#146;s, Faustus; and of my brothers one was called Faustinus, and the other Faustinianus.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1145"></A><A HREF="#fn_1145"><FONT SIZE="1">1146</FONT></A>
&#160; Then after I, their third son, was born, my mother saw a vision&#8212;so my father told me&#8212;<i>which told her</i>, that unless she immediately took away her twin sons, and left the city of Rome for exile for twelve years, she and they must die by an all-destructive fate.</p>
