<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.x.lx-p2"></A>&#8220;Therefore, if any one wishes to learn all things, <i>he cannot do it by</i> discussing them one by one; for, being mortal, he shall not be able to trace the counsel of God, and to scan immensity itself.&#160; But if, as we have said, he desires to learn all things, let him seek after the true Prophet; and when he has found Him, let him not treat with Him by questions and disputations and arguments; but if He has given any response, or pronounced any judgment, it cannot be doubted that this is certain.&#160; And therefore, before all things, let the true Prophet be sought, and His words be laid hold of.&#160; In respect to these this only should be discussed by every one, that he may satisfy himself if they are truly His prophetic words; that is, if they contain undoubted faith of things to come, if they mark out definite times, if they preserve the order of things, if they do not relate as last those things which are first, nor as first those things which were done last, if they contain nothing subtle, nothing composed by magic art to deceive, or if they have not transferred to themselves things which were revealed to others, and have mixed them with falsehoods.&#160; And when, all these things having been discussed by <A NAME="page_182"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 182</FONT></A> <a name="vi.iii.x.lx-Page_182"></A>right judgment, it is established that they are prophetic words, so they ought to be at once believed concerning all things on which they have spoken and answered.</p>
