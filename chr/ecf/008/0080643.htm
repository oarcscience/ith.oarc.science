<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.v.x-p2"></A>&#8220;If he is a Prophet, and is able to know how the world was made, and the things that are in it, and the things that shall be to the end, if He has foretold us anything, and we have ascertained that it has been perfectly accomplished, we easily believe that the things shall be which <i>He says</i> are to be, from the things that have been already; we believe Him, I say, as not only knowing, but foreknowing.&#160; To whom then, however limited an understanding he may have, does it not appear, that it behoves us, with respect to the things that are pleasing to God, to believe beyond all others Him who beyond all men knows, even though He has not learned?&#160; Wherefore, if any one should be unwilling to concede the power of knowing the truth to such an one&#8212;I mean to Him who has foreknowledge through the divinity of the Spirit that is in Him&#8212;conceding the power of knowing to any one else, is he not void of understanding, in conceding to him who is no prophet, that power of knowing which he would not concede to the Prophet?</p>
