<span id="vii.xii.ix-p2"></span>And others, a multitude both of men and
women, cried out, saying:  This man is a prophet, and the demons are
subject to him.  Pilate says to them who said that the demons <span
id="page_420">p. 420</span> <span id="vii.xii.ix-Page_420"></span>were
subject to Him:  Why, then, were not your teachers also subject to him? 
They say to Pilate:  We do not know.  And others said:  He raised
Lazarus from the tomb after he had been dead four days. <span

said to all the multitude of the Jews:  Why do you wish to pour out
innocent blood?
