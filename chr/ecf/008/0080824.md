id="vi.iv.ix.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI.—Phanes and Pluto.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.ix.vi-p2"></span>“This egg, then, which was the first
substance, growing somewhat hot, was broken by the living creature
within, and then there took shape and came forth something; <span
id="fr_1064"></span>[1065](#fn_1064) such as Orpheus also speaks of,
where he says, ‘when the capacious <span id="page_264">p. 264</span>
<span id="vi.iv.ix.vi-Page_264"></span>egg was broken,’ <span
id="fr_1065"></span>[1066](#fn_1065) etc.  And so by the mighty power of
that which appeared (<span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iv.ix.vi-p4.1"></span>phaneis</span>) and came forth, the globe
attained coherency, and maintained order, while it itself took its seat,
as it were, on the summit of heaven, there in ineffable mystery
diffusing light through endless ages.  But the productive matter left
inside the globe, separated the substances of all things.  For first its
lower part, just like the dregs, sank downwards of its own weight; and
this they called Pluto from its gravity, and weight, and great quantity
(<span class="c9"><span id="vi.iv.ix.vi-p4.2"></span>polu</span>) of
underlying matter, styling it the king of Hades and the dead. <span
id="fr_1066"></span>[1067](#fn_1066)

<span id="fn_1064"></span>[263:1065](0080824.htm#fr_1064) <span
id="vi.iv.ix.vi-p2.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.ix.vi-p3"></span> Wieseler corrects to “some such
being,” etc.; and below, “of him who appeared,” etc.; and “he took his
seat.”

<span id="vi.iv.ix.vi-p4"></span> The first word of this quotation gives
no sense, and has been omitted in the translation.  Lobeck suggests “at
its prime;” Hermann, “Heracapeian;” Duentzer, “ancient;” and Wieseler,
“white.”
