<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xiv.xxxi-p2"></A>&#8220;But some one of you will say, Must we then do whatsoever things we did while we were idolaters?&#160; I say to you, Not all things; but whatsoever you did well, you must do now, and more:&#160; for whatsoever is well done in error hangs upon truth, as if anything be ill done in the truth it is from error.&#160; Receive, therefore, from all quarters the things that are your own, and not those that are another&#146;s, and do not say, If those who are in error do anything well we are not bound to do it.&#160; For, on this principle, if any one who worships idols do not commit murder, we ought to commit murder, because he who is in error does not commit it.</p>
