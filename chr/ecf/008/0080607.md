Publican.”</span>

<span id="vi.iv.iii.xviii-p2"></span>“But some things also you ought of
yourselves to consider, on account of his not being able to speak openly
by reason of the plots.  Such as:  if he be hostile to any one, do not
wait for his speaking; and do not take part with that man, but prudently
follow the bishop’s will, being enemies to those to whom he is an enemy,
and not conversing with those with whom he does not converse, in order
that every one, desiring to have you all as his friends, may be
reconciled to him and be saved, listening to his discourse.  But if any
one remain a friend of those to whom he is an enemy, and speak to those
with whom he does not converse, he also himself is one of those who
would waste the church.  For, being with you in body, but not with you
in judgment, he is against you; and is much worse than the open enemies
from without, since with seeming friendship he disperses those who are
within.”
