Pleading.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.ix.xxxvi-p2"></span>But she declared with an oath, in
presence of my lord Peter’s wife, that from the time she recognised her
son, she had been unable to take any food from excess of joy, excepting
only that yesterday she drank a cup of water.  Peter’s wife also bore
witness, saying that it was even so.  Then Aquila said:  “What, then,
hinders her being baptized?”  Then Peter, smiling, said:  “But this is
not the fast of baptism, for it was not done in order to baptism.”  Then
Niceta said:  “But perhaps God, wishing that our mother, on our
recognition, should not be separated even for one day from participation
of our table, pre-ordained this fasting.  For as in her ignorance she
preserved her chastity, that it might profit her in order to the grace
of baptism; so she fasted before she knew the reason of fasting, that it
might profit her in order to baptism, and that immediately, from the
beginning of our acquaintance, she might enjoy communion of the table
with us.”
