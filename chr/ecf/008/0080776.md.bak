id="vi.iv.vii.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XV.—Wickedness of the Gods.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xv-p2"></span>“But I return to the foremost doctrine
of the Greeks, that which states in stories <span
id="fr_1036"></span>[1037](#fn_1036.md) that there are gods many, and
subject to all kinds of passions.  And not to spend much time upon
things that are clear, referring to the impious deeds of every one of
those who are called gods, I could not tell all their amours; those of
Zeus and Poseidon, of Pluto and Apollo, of Dionysus and Hercules, and of
them all singly. <span id="fr_1037"></span>[1038](#fn_1037.md)   And of
these you are yourselves not ignorant, and have been taught their
manners of life, being instructed in the Grecian learning, that, as
competitors with the gods, you might do like things.
