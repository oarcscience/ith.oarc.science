<span id="vi.iii.iii.vi-p2"></span>Not to make a long story of it,
whilst I was tossed upon these billows of my thought, a certain report,
which took its rise in the regions of the East in the reign of Tiberius
Cæsar, gradually reached us; and gaining strength as it passed through
every place, like some good message sent from God, it was filling the
whole world, and suffered not the divine will to be concealed in
silence.  For it was spread over all places, announcing that there was a
certain person in Judæa, who, beginning in the springtime, <span
id="fr_534"></span>[535](#fn_534.md) was preaching the kingdom of God to
the Jews, and saying that those should receive it who should observe the
ordinances of His commandments and His doctrine.  And that His speech
might be believed to be worthy of credit, and full of the Divinity, He
was said to perform many mighty works, and wonderful signs and prodigies
by His mere word; so that, as one having power from God, He made the
deaf to hear, and the blind to see, and the lame to stand erect, and
expelled every infirmity and all demons from men; yea, that He even
raised dead persons who were brought to Him; that He cured lepers also,
looking at them from a distance; and that there was absolutely nothing
which seemed impossible to Him.  These and such like things were
confirmed in process of time, not now by frequent rumours, but by the
plain statements of persons coming from those quarters; and day by day
the truth of the matter was further disclosed.
