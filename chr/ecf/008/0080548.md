<span id="vi.iii.xii.xl-p2"></span>When Peter had thus said, I Clement
asked Niceta that he would explain to us, for the sake of instruction,
some things concerning the allegories of the Gentiles, which he had
carefully studied; “for,” said I, “it is useful that when we dispute
with the Gentiles, we should not be unacquainted with these things.” 
Then said Niceta:  “If my lord Peter permits me, I can do as you ask
me.”  Then said Peter:  “To-day I have given you leave to speak in
opposition to the Gentiles, as you know.”  And Niceta said:  “Tell me
then, Clement, what you would have me speak about.”  And I said to him: 
“Inform us how the Gentiles represent matters concerning the supper of
the gods, which they had at the marriage of Peleus and Thetis. <span

shepherd Paris, and what of less Juno, Minerva, and Venus, between whom
he acted as judge?  What of Mercury? and what of the apple, and the
other things which follow in order?”
