<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.vi.xv-p2"></A>&#8220;But our Master did not prophesy after this fashion; but, as I have already said, being a prophet by an inborn and ever-flowing Spirit, and knowing all things at all times, He confidently set forth, plainly as I said before, sufferings, places, appointed times, manners, limits.&#160; Accordingly, therefore, prophesying concerning the temple, He said:&#160; &#145;See ye these buildings?&#160; Verily I say to you, There shall not be left here one stone upon another which shall not be taken away; and this generation shall not pass until the destruction begin.&#160; For they shall come, and shall sit here, and shall besiege it, and shall slay your children here.&#146;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_957"></A><A HREF="#fn_957"><FONT SIZE="1">958</FONT></A>
&#160; And in like manner He spoke in plain words the things that were straightway to happen, which we can now see with our eyes, in order that the accomplishment might be among those to whom the word was spoken.&#160; For the Prophet of truth utters the word of proof in order to the faith of His hearers.</p>
