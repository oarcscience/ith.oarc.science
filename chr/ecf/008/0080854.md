id="vi.iv.x.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter IX.—Simon Attacks Peter.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.x.ix-p2"></span>No sooner had he reached Beyrout than an
earthquake took place; and the multitude, running to Peter, said, “Help
us, for we are afraid we shall all utterly perish.”  Then Simon
ventured, along with Appion and Anubion and Athenodorus, and the rest of
his companions, to cry out to the people against Peter in public: 
“Flee, friends, from this man! he is a magician; trust us, he it was who
caused this earthquake: he sent us these diseases to terrify us, as if
he were God Himself.”  And many such false charges did Simon and his
friends bring against Peter, as one who could do things above human
power.  But as soon as the people gave him a moment’s quiet, Peter with
surprising boldness gave a little laugh, and said, “Friends, I admit
that I can do, God willing, what these men say; and more than that, I am
ready, if you do not believe what I say, to overturn your city from top
to bottom.”
