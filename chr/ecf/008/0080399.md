Their Desired Haven.”</span>

<span id="vi.iii.ix.xxxii-p2"></span>Then Niceta began to say:  “On that
night, O mother, when the ship was broken up, and we were being tossed
upon the sea, supported on a fragment of the wreck, certain men, whose
business it was to rob by sea, found us, and placed us in their boat,
and overcoming the power of the waves by rowing, by various stretches
brought us to Cæsarea Stratonis.  There they starved us, and beat us,
and terrified us, that we might not disclose the truth; and having
changed our names, they sold us to a certain widow, a very honourable
women, named Justa.  She, having bought us, treated us as sons, so that
she carefully educated us in Greek literature and liberal arts.  And
when we grew up, we also attended to philosophic studies, that we might
be able to confute the Gentiles, by supporting the doctrines of the
divine religion by philosophic disputations.
