<span id="vi.iv.v.xxxv-p2"></span>When Peter had thus spoken, towards
dawn Zacchæus entered and saluted us, and said to Peter:  “Simon puts
off the inquiry till to-morrow; for to-day is his Sabbath, which occurs
at intervals of eleven days.”  To him Peter answered:  “Say to Simon,
Whenever thou wishest; and know thou that we are always in readiness to
meet thee, by divine providence, when thou desirest.”  And Zacchæus
hearing this, went out to return the answer.
