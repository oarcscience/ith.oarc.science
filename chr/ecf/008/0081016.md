<span id="vi.iv.xvi.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.xvi.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI.—Mattidia Has Unintentionally
Fasted One Day.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xvi.xi-p2"></span>“But since your mother has real
confidence in the efficacy of baptism, <span
id="fr_1171"></span>[1172](#fn_1171.md) let her fast at least one day
before her baptism.”  But she swore:  “During the two past days, while I
related to the woman <span id="fr_1172"></span>[1173](#fn_1172.md) all the
events connected with the recognition, I could not, in consequence of my
excessive joy, partake of food:  only yesterday I took a little water.” 
Peter’s wife bore testimony to her statement with an oath, saying:  “In
truth she did not taste anything.”  And Aquila, who must rather be
called Faustinianus <span id="fr_1173"></span>[1174](#fn_1173.md) in
future, said:  “There is nothing, therefore, to prevent her being
baptized.”  And Peter, smiling, replied:  “But that is not a baptismal
fast which has not taken place on account of the baptism itself.”  And
Faustinus answered:  “Perhaps God, not wishing to separate our mother a
single day after our recognition from our table, has arranged beforehand
the fast.  For as she was chaste in the times of her ignorance, doing
what the true religion inculcated, <span
id="fr_1174"></span>[1175](#fn_1174.md) so even now perhaps God has
arranged that she should fast one day before for the sake of the true
baptism, that, from the first day of her recognising us, she might take
her meals along with us.”
