<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.iii.liv-p2"></A>&#8220;For when the rising of Christ was at hand for the abolition of sacrifices, and for the bestowal of the grace of baptism, the enemy, understanding from the predictions that the time was at hand, wrought various schisms among the people, that, if haply it might be possible to abolish the former sin,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_582"></A><A HREF="#fn_582"><FONT SIZE="1">583</FONT></A>
 the latter fault might be incorrigible.&#160; The first schism, therefore, was that of those who were called Sadducees, which took their rise almost in the time of John.&#160; These, as more righteous than others, began to separate themselves from the assembly of the people, and to deny the resurrection of the dead,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_583"></A><A HREF="#fn_583"><FONT SIZE="1">584</FONT></A>
 and to assert that by an argument of infidelity, saying that it was unworthy that God should be worshipped, as it were, under the promise of a reward.&#160; The first author of this opinion was Dositheus;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_584"></A><A HREF="#fn_584"><FONT SIZE="1">585</FONT></A>
 the second was Simon.&#160; Another schism is that of the Samaritans; for <A NAME="page_92"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 92</FONT></A> <a name="vi.iii.iii.liv-Page_92"></A>they deny the resurrection of the dead, and assert that God is not to be worshipped in Jerusalem, but on Mount Gerizim.&#160; They indeed rightly, from the predictions of Moses, expect the one true Prophet; but by the wickedness of Dositheus they were hindered from believing that Jesus is He whom they were expecting.&#160; The scribes also, and Pharisees, are led away into another schism; but these, being baptized by John, and holding the word of truth received from the tradition of Moses as the key of the kingdom of heaven, have hid it from the hearing of the people.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_585"></A><A HREF="#fn_585"><FONT SIZE="1">586</FONT></A>
&#160; Yea, some even of the disciples of John, who seemed to be great ones, have separated themselves from the people, and proclaimed their own master as the Christ.&#160; But all these schisms have been prepared, that by means of them the faith of Christ and baptism might be hindered.&#8221;</p>
