id="vi.iv.v.xlv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLV.—How God is to Be Thought
of.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.v.xlv-p2"></span>“Wherefore, Clement, my son, beware of
thinking otherwise of God, than that He is the only God, and Lord, and
Father, good and righteous, the Creator, long-suffering, merciful, the
sustainer, the benefactor, ordaining love of men, counselling purity,
immortal and making immortal, incomparable, dwelling in the souls of the
good, that cannot be contained and yet is contained, <span
id="fr_950"></span>[951](#fn_950.md) who has fixed the great world as a
centre in space, who has spread out the heavens and solidified the
earth, who has stored up the water, who has disposed the stars in the
sky, who has made the fountains flow in the earth, has produced faults,
has raised up mountains, hath set bounds to the sea, has ordered winds
and blasts, who by the spirit of counsel has kept safely the body
comprehended in a boundless sea.

<span id="vi.iv.v.xlv-p3"></span> The Latin has here, “imperceptus et
perceptus;” but Wieseler points out that <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.v.xlv-p3.1"></span>χωρούμενος</span> has reference to God’s
dwelling in the souls of the good, and thus He is contained by them.
