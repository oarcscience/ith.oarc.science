<span id="vi.iv.xi.x-p2"></span>“But thus the matter stands.  The only
good God having made all things well, and having handed them over to
man, who was made after His image, he who had been made breathing of the
divinity of Him who made him, being a true prophet and knowing all
things, for the honour of the Father who had given all things to him,
and for the salvation of the sons born of him, as a genuine father
preserving his affection towards the children born of him, and wishing
them, for their advantage, to love God and be loved of Him, showed them
the way which leads to His friendship, teaching them by what deeds of
men the one God and Lord of all is pleased; and having exhibited to them
the things that are pleasing to Him, appointed a perpetual law to all,
which neither can be abrogated by enemies, nor is vitiated by any
impious one, nor is concealed in any place, but which can be read by
all.  To them, therefore, by obedience to the law, all things were in
abundance,—the fairest of fruits, fulness of years, freedom from grief
and from disease, bestowed upon them without fear, with all salubrity of
the air.
