<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c6"><span
id="ix.xiv.ii-p1.1"></span>A Homily on Guria and Shamuna, Composed by
Mar Jacob.</span>

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p2"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="ix.xiv.ii-p2.1"></span>Shamuna</span> and Guria, martyrs who made
themselves illustrious in their afflictions,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p3"></span>Have in love required of me to tell of
their illustrious deeds.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p4"></span>To champions of the faith the doctrine
calleth me,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p5"></span>That I should go and behold their
contests and their crowns.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p6"></span>Children of the right hand, who have done
battle against the left,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p7"></span>Have called me this day to recite the
marvellous tale of their conflicts:—

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p8"></span>Simple old men, who entered into the
fight like heroes,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p9"></span>And nobly distinguished themselves in the
strife of blood:

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p10"></span>Those who were the salt of our land, and
it was sweetened thereby,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p11"></span>And its savour was restored, which had
become insipid through unbelief:

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p12"></span>Candlesticks of gold, which were full of
the oil of the crucifixion,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p13"></span>By which was lighted up all our region,
which had turned to darkness:

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p14"></span>Two lamps, of which, when all the winds
were blowing

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p15"></span>Of every *kind of* error, the lights
were not put out;

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p16"></span>Good labourers, who from the spring of
day laboured

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p17"></span>In the blessed vineyard of the house of
God right duteously:

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p18"></span>Bulwarks of our land, who became to us
as it were a defence

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p19"></span>Against all spoilers in all the wars
that surrounded us:

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p20"></span>Havens of peace, a place also of retreat
for all that were distressed,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p21"></span>And a resting-place for the head of
every one that was in need of succour:

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p22"></span>Two precious pearls, which were

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p23"></span>An ornament for the bride of my lord
Abgar, the Aramæan’s son.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p24"></span>Teachers they were who practised their
teaching in blood,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p25"></span>And whose faith was known by their
sufferings.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p26"></span>On their bodies they wrote the story of
the Son of God

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p27"></span>With *the marks of* combs and scourges
which thickly covered them.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p28"></span>They showed their love, not by words of
the mouth alone,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p29"></span>But by tortures and by the rending of
their limbs asunder.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p30"></span>For the love of the Son of God they gave
up their bodies:

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p31"></span><span id="page_715">p. 715</span> <span
id="ix.xiv.ii-Page_715"></span>Since it beseemeth the lover that for his
love he should give up himself.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p32"></span>Fire and sword proved their love, how
true *it was;*

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p33"></span>And more beautiful than silver tried in
*a furnace of* earth were their necks.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p34"></span>They looked on God, and, because they
saw His exalted beauties,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p35"></span>Therefore did they look with contempt
upon their sufferings for His sake.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p36"></span>The Sun of righteousness had arisen in
their hearts;

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p37"></span>And they were enlightened by it, and
with *His* light chased they away the darkness.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p38"></span>At the idols of vanity, which error had
brought in, they laughed,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p39"></span>Instinct with the faith of the Son of
God which is full of light.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p40"></span>The love of the Lord was as a fire in
their hearts;

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p41"></span>Nor could all the brambles of idolatry
stand before it.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p42"></span>Fixed was their love on God
unchangeably: <span id="fr_3327"></span>[3328](#fn_3327)

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p44"></span>And therefore did they look with scorn
upon the sword, <span id="fr_3328"></span>[3329](#fn_3328) all athirst
as it was for blood.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p46"></span>With guilelessness and *yet with* wisdom
stood they in the judgment-hall,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p47"></span>As they had been commanded by the
Teacher of that which is true.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p48"></span>Despising as they did kindred and
family, guileless were they;

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p49"></span>Forasmuch, also, as possessions and
wealth were held in no account by them.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p50"></span>*Nor guileless only:*  for in the
judgment-hall with the wisdom of serpents *too*

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p51"></span>They were heedful of the faith of the
house of God.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p52"></span>When a serpent is seized and struck, he
guards his head,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p53"></span>But gives up and leaves exposed all his
body to his captors:

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p54"></span>And, so long as his head is kept *from
harm*, his life abideth in him;

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p55"></span>But, if the head be struck, his life is
left *a prey* to destruction.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p56"></span>The head of the soul is men’s faith;

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p57"></span>And, if this be preserved *unharmed*, by
it is also preserved their life: <span
id="fr_3329"></span>[3330](#fn_3329)

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p59"></span>Even though the whole body be lacerated
with blows,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p60"></span>*Yet*, so long as faith is preserved,
the soul is alive;

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p61"></span>But, if faith is struck *down* by
unbelief,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p62"></span>Lost is the soul, and life has perished
from the man.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p63"></span>Shamuna and Guria of the faith as
men <span id="fr_3330"></span>[3331](#fn_3330)

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p65"></span>Were heedful, that it should not be
struck *down* by persecutors:

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p66"></span>For they knew that, if faith is
preserved,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p67"></span>Both soul and body are preserved from
destruction.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p68"></span>And, because of this, touching their
faith were they solicitous,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p69"></span>That that should not be struck *down* in
which their very life was hidden.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p70"></span>They gave up their bodies both to blows
and to dislocation, <span id="fr_3331"></span>[3332](#fn_3331)

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p72"></span>Yea to every *kind of* torture, that
their faith should not be stricken *down;*

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p73"></span>And, even as the serpent also hides his
head from blows,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p74"></span>So hid they their faith within their
hearts;

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p75"></span>And the body was smitten, and endured
stripes, and bore sufferings:

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p76"></span>But overthrown was not their faith which
was within their hearts.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p77"></span>The mouth betrayeth the soul to death
when it speaks,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p78"></span>And with the tongue, as with a sword,
worketh slaughter.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p79"></span>And from it spring up both life and
death to men:

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p80"></span>Denying *a man* dies, confessing he
lives, and *the mouth* hath power over it.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p81"></span>Denial is death, and in confession is
the soul’s life;

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p82"></span>And power hath the mouth over them both,
like a judge.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p83"></span>The word of the mouth openeth the door
for death to enter in;

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p84"></span>This, too, calleth for life, and it
beameth forth upon the man.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p85"></span>Even the robber by one word of faith

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p86"></span>Won him the kingdom, and became heir of
paradise, <span id="fr_3332"></span>[3333](#fn_3332) all fraught with
blessings.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p88"></span>The wicked judges too, from the martyrs,
the sons of the right hand,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p89"></span>Demanded that by word of mouth only they
should blaspheme;

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p90"></span>But, like true men holding fast the
faith,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p91"></span>They uttered not a word by which
unbelief might be served.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p92"></span>Shamuna, beauty of our faith, who is
adequate to *tell of* thee?

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p93"></span>All too narrow is my mouth for thy
praise, too mean for thee to be spoken of by it.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p94"></span>Thy truth is thy beauty, thy crown thy
suffering, thy wealth thy stripes,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p95"></span>And by reason of thy blows magnificent
is the beauty of thy championship.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p96"></span><span id="page_716">p. 716</span> <span
id="ix.xiv.ii-Page_716"></span>Proud of thee is our country, as of a
treasury which is full of gold:

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p97"></span>Since wealth art thou to us, and a
coveted store which cannot be stolen *from us*.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p98"></span>Guria, martyr, staunch hero of our
faith,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p99"></span>Who shall suffice thee, to recount thy
beauties divine?

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p100"></span>Lo! tortures on thy body are set like
gems of beryl,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p101"></span>And the sword on thy neck like a chain
of choice gold.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p102"></span>Thy blood upon thy form is a robe of
glory full of beauty,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p103"></span>And the scourging of thy back a vesture
with which the sun may not compare.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p104"></span>Radiant thou art and comely by virtue
of these thy sufferings, so abounding;

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p105"></span>And resplendent are thy beauties,
because of the pains which are *so* severe upon thee.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p106"></span>Shamuna, our riches, richer art thou
than the rich:

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p107"></span>For lo! the rich stand at thy door,
that thou mayest relieve them.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p108"></span>Small thy village, poor thy country: 
who, then, gave thee

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p109"></span>That lords of villages and cities
should court thy favour?

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p110"></span>Lo! judges in their robes and vestments

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p111"></span>Take dust from thy threshold, as
*though it were* the medicine of life.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p112"></span>The cross is rich, and to its
worshippers increaseth riches;

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p113"></span>And its poverty despiseth all the
riches of the world.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p114"></span>Shamuna and Guria, sons of the poor,
lo! at your doors

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p115"></span>Bow down the rich, that they may
receive from you *supplies for* their wants.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p116"></span>The Son of God in poverty and want

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p117"></span>Showed to the world that all its riches
are as nothing,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p118"></span>*His disciples*, all fishermen, all
poor, all weak,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p119"></span>All men of little note, became
illustrious through His faith.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p120"></span>One fisherman, whose “village” too was
a home of fishermen, <span id="fr_3333"></span>[3334](#fn_3333)

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p122"></span>He made chief over the twelve, yea head
of the house. <span id="fr_3334"></span>[3335](#fn_3334)

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p124"></span>One a tentmaker, who aforetime was a
persecutor,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p125"></span>He seized upon, and made him a chosen
vessel for the faith.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p126"></span>Shamuna and Guria came from villages
that were not wealthy,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p127"></span>And lo! in a great city became they
lords;

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p128"></span>And its chief men, its judges also,
stand before their doors,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p129"></span>And they solicit their charity to
satisfy their wants.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p130"></span>From their confession of the faith of
the Son of God

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p131"></span>These blessed men acquired riches
beyond compute.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p132"></span>Poor did He Himself become, and the
poor made He rich;

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p133"></span>And lo! enriched is the whole creation
through His poverty.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p134"></span>The chosen martyrs did battle against
error,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p135"></span>And in the confession of the Son of God
stood they firm like valiant men.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p136"></span>They went in and confessed Him before
the judge with look undaunted, <span
id="fr_3335"></span>[3336](#fn_3335)

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p138"></span>That He too might confess them, even as
they confessed Him, before His Father.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p139"></span>There arose against them the war of
pagans like a tempest;

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p140"></span>But the cross was their helmsman, and
steered them on.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p141"></span>They were required to sacrifice to
lifeless images,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p142"></span>But they departed not from their
confession of the Son of God.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p143"></span>The wind of idolatry blew in their
faces,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p144"></span>But they themselves were as rocks piled
up against the hurricane.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p145"></span>Like a swift whirlwind, error snatched
at them;

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p146"></span>But, forasmuch as they were sheltered
by the crucifixion, it hurt them not.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p147"></span>The Evil One set on all his dogs to
bark, that they might bite them;

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p148"></span>But, forasmuch as they had the cross
for a staff, they put them all to flight.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p149"></span>But who is sufficient to tell of their
contests,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p150"></span>Or their sufferings, or the rending
asunder of their limbs?

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p151"></span>Or who can paint the picture of their
coronation, <span id="fr_3336"></span>[3337](#fn_3336)

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p153"></span>How they went up from the contest
covered with glory?

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p154"></span>To judgment they went in, but of the
judge they took no account;

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p155"></span>Nor were they anxious what they should
say when questioned.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p156"></span>The judge menaced *them*, and
multiplied his words of threatening;

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p157"></span>And recounted tortures and all *kinds
of* inflictions, that he might terrify them.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p158"></span>He spake great words, <span
id="fr_3337"></span>[3338](#fn_3337) that by fright and intimidation,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p160"></span>By menaces too, he might incline them
to sacrifice.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p161"></span><span id="page_717">p. 717</span> <span
id="ix.xiv.ii-Page_717"></span>Yet the combatants despised the menaces,
and the intimidations,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p162"></span>And the sentence of judgment, and all
bodily deaths;

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p163"></span>And they prepared themselves for insult
and stripes, and for blows,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p164"></span>And for provocation, and to be dragged
along, and to be burnt;

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p165"></span>For imprisonment also, and for bonds,
and for all evil things,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p166"></span>And for all tortures, and for all
sufferings, rejoicing all the while.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p167"></span>They were not alarmed nor affrighted,
nor dismayed,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p168"></span>Nor did the sharpness of the tortures
bend them to sacrifice.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p169"></span>Their body they despised, and as dung
upon the ground accounted they it:

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p170"></span>For they knew that, the more it was
beaten, the more would its beauty increase;

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p171"></span>And, the more the judge increased his
menaces to alarm them,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p172"></span>The more did they show their contempt
of him, having no fear of his threats.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p173"></span>He kept telling them what tortures he
had prepared for them;

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p174"></span>And they continued telling him about
Gehenna which was reserved for him.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p175"></span>By those things which he told *them* he
tried to frighten them to sacrifice;

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p176"></span>And they spoke to him about the fearful
judgment yonder.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p177"></span>Truth is wiser than wise words,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p178"></span>And very hateful, however much it may
be adorned, is falsehood.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p179"></span>Shamuna and Guria went on speaking
truth,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p180"></span>While the judge continued to utter
falsehood.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p181"></span>And therefore were they not afraid of
his threatening,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p182"></span>Because all his menaces against the
truth were accounted *by them* as empty sound. <span
id="fr_3338"></span>[3339](#fn_3338)

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p184"></span>The intercourse of the world they
despised, they contemned and scorned, *yea* they abandoned;

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p185"></span>And to return to it they had no wish,
or to enter it *again*.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p186"></span>From the place of judgment they set
their faces to depart

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p187"></span>To that meeting-place for them all, the
life of the new world.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p188"></span>They cared neither for possessions nor
for houses,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p189"></span>Nor for the advantages of this world,
so full of evil.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p190"></span>In the world of light was their heart
bound captive with God,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p191"></span>And to “that” country did they set
their face to depart;

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p192"></span>And they looked to the sword, to come
and be a bridge

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p193"></span>To let them pass over to God, for whom
they were longing.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p194"></span>This world they accounted as a little
tent,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p195"></span>But that yonder as a city full of
beauties;

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p196"></span>And they were in haste by the sword to
depart hence

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p197"></span>To the land of light, which is full of
blessing for those who are worthy of it.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p198"></span>The judge commanded to hang them up by
their arms,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p199"></span>And without mercy did they stretch them
out in bitter agony.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p200"></span>A demon’s fury breathed rage into the
heart of the judge,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p201"></span>And embittered him against the stedfast
ones, *inciting him* to crush them;

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p202"></span>And between the height and the depth he
stretched them out to afflict them:

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p203"></span>And they were a marvel to both sides,
*when they saw* how much they endured.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p204"></span>At the old men’s frame heaven and earth
marvelled,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p205"></span>*To see* how much suffering it bore nor
cried out for help under *their* affliction.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p206"></span>Hung up and dragged along are their
feeble bodies by their arms,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p207"></span>Yet is there deep silence, nor is there
one that cries out for help or that murmurs.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p208"></span>Amazed were all who beheld their
contests,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p209"></span>*To see* how *calmly* the outstretched
forms bore the inflictions *laid upon them*. <span
id="fr_3339"></span>[3340](#fn_3339)

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p211"></span>Amazed too was Satan at their spotless
frames,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p212"></span>*To see* what weight of affliction they
sustained without a groan.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p213"></span>Yea, and gladdened too were the angels
by that fortitude *of theirs*,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p214"></span>*To see* how patiently it bore that
contest so terrible that was.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p215"></span>But, as combatants who were awaiting
their crowns,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p216"></span>There entered no sense of weariness
into their minds.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p217"></span>Nay, it was the judge that grew weary;
yea, he was astonished:

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p218"></span>But the noble men *before him felt* no
weariness in their afflictions.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p219"></span>He asked them whether they would
consent to sacrifice;

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p220"></span>But the mouth was unable to speak from
pain.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p221"></span>Thus did the persecutors increase their
inflictions,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p222"></span>Until they gave no place for the word
to be spoken.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p223"></span><span id="page_718">p. 718</span> <span
id="ix.xiv.ii-Page_718"></span>Silent was the mouth from the inflictions
laid on their limbs;

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p224"></span>But the will, like that of a hero, was
nerved with fortitude from itself.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p225"></span>Alas for the persecutors! how destitute
were they of righteousness!

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p226"></span>But the children of light—how were they
clad in faith!

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p227"></span>They demand speech, when there is no
place for speaking,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p228"></span>Since the word of the mouth was
forbidden them by pain.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p229"></span>Fast bound was the body, and silent the
mouth, and it was unable

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p230"></span>To utter the word when unrighteously
questioned.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p231"></span>And what should the martyr do, who had
no power to say,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p232"></span>When he was questioned, that he would
not sacrifice?

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p233"></span>All silent were the old men full of
faith,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p234"></span>And from pain they were incapable of
speaking.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p235"></span>Yet questioned they were:  and in what
way, if a man is silent

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p236"></span>When he is questioned, shall he assent
to that which is said?

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p237"></span>But the old men, that they might not be
thought to assent,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p238"></span>Expressed clearly by signs the word
which it behoved them to speak.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p239"></span>Their heads they shook, and, instead of
speech, by a dumb sign they showed

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p240"></span>The resolve of the new man that was
within.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p241"></span>Their heads hung down, signifying
amidst their pains

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p242"></span>That they were not going to sacrifice,
and every one understood their meaning.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p243"></span>As long as there was in them place for
speech, with speech did they confess;

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p244"></span>But, when it was forbidden them by
pain, they spake with a dumb sign.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p245"></span>Of faith they spoke both with the voice
and without the voice:

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p246"></span>So that, when speaking and also when
silent, they were *alike* stedfast.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p247"></span>Who but must be amazed at the path of
life, how narrow it is,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p248"></span>And how straight to him that desires to
walk in it?

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p249"></span>Who but must marvel *to see* that, when
the will is watchful and ready,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p250"></span>It is very broad and full of light to
him that goeth therein?

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p251"></span>About the path are ditches; full also
is it of pitfalls;

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p252"></span>And, if one turn but a little aside
from it, a ditch receives him.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p253"></span>That dumb sign only is there between
the right and the left,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p254"></span>And on “Yea” and “Nay” stand <span
id="fr_3340"></span>[3341](#fn_3340) sin and righteousness.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p256"></span>By a dumb sign only did the blessed men
plainly signify that they would not sacrifice,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p257"></span>And in virtue of a single dumb sign did
the path lead them to Eden;

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p258"></span>And, if this same dumb sign had
inclined and turned down but a little

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p259"></span>Toward the depth, the path of the old
men would have been to Gehenna.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p260"></span>Upwards they made a sign, *to signify*
that upwards were they prepared to ascend;

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p261"></span>And in consequence of that sign they
ascended and mingled with the heavenly ones.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p262"></span>Between sign and sign were Paradise and
Gehenna:

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p263"></span>They made a sign that they would not
sacrifice, and they inherited the place of the kingdom.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p264"></span>Even while they were silent they were
advocates for the Son of God:

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p265"></span>For not in multitude of words doth
faith consist.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p266"></span>That fortitude of theirs was a
full-voiced confession,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p267"></span>And as though with open mouth declared
they *their* faith by signs;

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p268"></span>And every one knew what they were
saying, though silent,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p269"></span>And enriched and increased was the
faith of the house of God;

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p270"></span>And error was put to shame by reason of
two old men, who, though they spake not,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p271"></span>Vanquished it; and they kept silence,
and their faith stood fast.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p272"></span>And, though tempestuous accents were
heard from the judge,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p273"></span>And the commands of the emperor were
dreadful, yea violent,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p274"></span>And paganism had a bold face and an
open mouth,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p275"></span>And its voice was raised, and silent
were the old men with pain,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p276"></span>*Yet* null and void became the command
and drowned was the voice of the judge,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p277"></span>And without speech the mute sign of the
martyrs bore off the palm.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p278"></span>Talking and clamour, and the sound of
stripes, on the left;

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p279"></span>And deep silence and suffering standing
on the right;

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p280"></span>And, by one mute sign with which the
old men pointed above their heads,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p281"></span>The head of faith was lifted up, and
error was put to shame.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p282"></span><span id="page_719">p. 719</span> <span
id="ix.xiv.ii-Page_719"></span>Worsted in the encounter were they who
spoke, and the victory was to the silent:

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p283"></span>For, voiceless they uttered by signs
the discourse of faith.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p284"></span>They took them down, because they had
vanquished while silent;

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p285"></span>And they put them in bonds, threatening
*yet* to vanquish them.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p286"></span>Bonds and a dungeon void of light were
by the martyrs

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p287"></span>Held of no account—yea *rather* as the
light which has no end.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p288"></span>*To be* without bread, and without
water, and without light,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p289"></span>Pleased them well, because of the love
of the Son of God.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p290"></span>The judge commanded by their feet to
hang them up

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p291"></span>With their heads downwards, by a
sentence all unrighteous:

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p292"></span>Hanged up was Shamuna with his head
downwards; and he prayed

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p293"></span>*In* prayer pure and strained clear by
pain.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p294"></span>Sweet fruit was hanging on the tree in
that judgment-hall,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p295"></span>And its taste and smell made the very
denizens of heaven to marvel.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p296"></span>Afflicted was his body, but sound was
his faith;

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p297"></span>Bound fast was his person, but
unfettered was his prayer over his deed.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p298"></span>For, prayer nothing whatsoever turneth
aside,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p299"></span>And *nothing* hindereth it—not even
sword, not even fire.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p300"></span>His form was turned upside down, but
*his* prayer was unrestrained,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p301"></span>And straight was its path on high to
the abode of the angels.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p302"></span>The more the affliction of the chosen
martyr was increased,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p303"></span>The more from his lips was all
confession heard.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p304"></span>The martyrs longed for the whetted
sword affectionately,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p305"></span>And sought it as a treasure full of
riches.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p306"></span>A new work has the Son of God wrought
in the world—

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p307"></span>That dreadful death should be yearned
for <span id="fr_3341"></span>[3342](#fn_3341) by many.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p309"></span>That men should run to meet the sword
is a thing unheard of,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p310"></span>Except they were those whom Jesus has
enlisted in His service by His crucifixion.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p311"></span>That death is bitter, every one knoweth
lo! from earliest time:

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p312"></span>To martyrs alone is it not bitter to be
slain.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p313"></span>They laughed at the whetted sword when
they saw it,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p314"></span>And greeted it with smiles:  for it was
that which was the occasion of their crowns.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p315"></span>As though it had been something hated,
they left the body to be beaten:

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p316"></span>Even though loving it, they held it not
back from pains.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p317"></span>For the sword they waited, and the
sword went forth and crowned them:

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p318"></span>Because for it they looked; and it came
to meet them, even as they desired.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p319"></span>The Son of God slew death by His
crucifixion;

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p320"></span>And, inasmuch as death is slain, it
caused no suffering to the martyrs.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p321"></span>With a wounded serpent one playeth
without fear;

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p322"></span>A slain lion even a coward will drag
along:

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p323"></span>The great serpent our Lord crushed by
His crucifixion;

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p324"></span>The dread lion did the Son of God slay
by His sufferings.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p325"></span>Death bound He fast, and laid him
prostrate and trampled on him at the gate of Hades;

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p326"></span>And *now* whosoever will draweth near
and mocketh at him, because he is slain.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p327"></span>These old men, Shamuna and Guria,
mocked at death,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p328"></span>As at that lion which by the Son of God
was slain.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p329"></span>The great serpent, which slew Adam
among the trees,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p330"></span>*Who* could seize, so long as he drank
not of the blood of the cross?

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p331"></span>The Son of God crushed the dragon by
His crucifixion,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p332"></span>And lo! boys and old men mock at the
wounded serpent.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p333"></span>Pierced is the lion with the spear
which *pierced* the side of the Son of God;

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p334"></span>And whosoever will trampleth on him,
yea mocketh at him.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p335"></span>The Son of God—He is the cause of all
good things,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p336"></span>And Him doth it behove every mouth to
celebrate.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p337"></span>He did Himself espouse <span
id="fr_3342"></span>[3343](#fn_3342) the bride with the blood which
flowed from His wounds,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p339"></span>And of His wedding-friends He demanded
as a nuptial gift <span id="fr_3343"></span>[3344](#fn_3343) the blood
of their necks.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p341"></span>The Lord of the wedding-feast hung on
the cross in nakedness,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p342"></span>And whosoever came to be a guest, He
let fall His blood upon him.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p343"></span><span id="page_720">p. 720</span> <span
id="ix.xiv.ii-Page_720"></span>Shamuna and Guria gave up their bodies
for His sake

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p344"></span>To sufferings and tomes and to all the
various forms of woe. <span id="fr_3344"></span>[3345](#fn_3344)

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p346"></span>At Him they looked as He was mocked by
wicked men,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p347"></span>And thus did they themselves endure
mockery without a groan.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p348"></span>Edessa was enriched by your slaughter,
O blessed ones:

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p349"></span>For ye adorned her with your crowns and
with your sufferings.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p350"></span>Her beauty are ye, her bulwark ye, her
salt ye,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p351"></span>Her riches and her store, yea her boast
and all her treasure.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p352"></span>Faithful stewards are ye: <span
id="fr_3345"></span>[3346](#fn_3345)

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p354"></span>Since by your sufferings ye did array
the bride in beauty.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p355"></span>The daughter of the Parthians, who was
espoused to the cross, <span id="fr_3346"></span>[3347](#fn_3346)

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p357"></span>Of *you* maketh her boast:  since by
your teaching lo! she was enlightened.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p358"></span>Her advocates are ye; scribes who,
though silent, vanquished

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p359"></span>All error, whilst its voice was
uplifted high in unbelief.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p360"></span>Those old men <span
id="fr_3347"></span>[3348](#fn_3347) of the daughter of the Hebrews were
sons of Belial, <span id="fr_3348"></span>[3349](#fn_3348)

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p363"></span>False witnesses, who killed Naboth,
feigning themselves *to be true*.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p364"></span>Her did Edessa outdo by her two old men
full of beauty,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p365"></span>Who were witnesses to the Son of God,
and died like Naboth.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p366"></span>Two were there, and two here, old men;

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p367"></span>And these were called witnesses, and
witnesses those.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p368"></span>Let us now see which of them were
witnesses chosen of God,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p369"></span>And which city is beloved by reason of
her old men and of her honourable ones.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p370"></span>Lo! the sons of Belial who slew Naboth
are witnesses;

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p371"></span>And here Shamuna and Guria, again, are
witnesses.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p372"></span>Let us now see which witnesses, and
which old men,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p373"></span>And which city can stand with
confidence <span id="fr_3349"></span>[3350](#fn_3349) before God.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p375"></span>Sons of Belial were those witnesses of
that adulterous woman,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p376"></span>And lo! their shame is all portrayed in
their names.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p377"></span>Edessa’s just and righteous old men,
her witnesses,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p378"></span>Were like Naboth, who himself also was
slain for righteousness’ sake.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p379"></span>They were not like the two lying sons
of Belial,

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p380"></span>Nor is Edessa like Zion, which also
crucified *the Lord*.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p381"></span>Like herself her old men were false,
yea dared

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p382"></span>To shed on the ground innocent blood
wickedly.

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p383"></span>*But* by these witnesses here lo! the
truth is spoken.—

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p384"></span>Blessed be He who gave us the
treasure-store of their crowns!

<span id="ix.xiv.ii-p385"></span>*Here* endeth the Homily on Guria and
Shamuna.
