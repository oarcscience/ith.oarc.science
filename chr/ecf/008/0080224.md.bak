id="vi.iii.v.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIV.—God the Author of Good, Not
of Evil.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.v.xiv-p2"></span>To this Peter answered:  “Since, then,
you confess that you are ignorant, now learn.  Your question demanded
our deliverance on two matters that are contrary to one another.  For
every motion is divided into two parts, so that a certain part is moved
by necessity, and another by will; and those things which are moved by
necessity are always in motion, those which are moved by will, not
always.  For example, the sun’s motion is performed by necessity to
complete its appointed circuit, and every state and service of heaven
depends upon necessary motions.  But man directs the voluntary motions
of his own actions.  And thus there are some things which have been
created for this end, that in their services they should be subject to
necessity, and should be unable to do aught else than what has been
assigned to them; and when they have accomplished this service, the
Creator of all things, who thus arranged them according to His will,
preserves them.  But there are other things, in which there is a power
of will, and which have a free choice of doing what they will.  These,
as I have said, do not remain always in that order in which they were
created:  but according as their will leads them, and the judgment of
their mind inclines them, they effect either good or evil; and therefore
He hath proposed rewards to those who do well, and penalties to those
who do evil. <span id="fr_682"></span>[683](#fn_682.md)
