<span id="vi.iii.xi.xvii-p3"></span>“In short, when Mars, holding the
centre in his house, regards Saturn quarterly, with Mercury towards the
centre, the full moon coming upon him, in the daily <span
class="c9"><span id="vi.iii.xi.xvii-p3.1"></span>Genesis</span>, he
produces murderers, and those who are to fall by the sword, <span
id="fr_842"></span>[843](#fn_842.md) bloody, drunken, lustful, devilish
men, inquirers into secrets, <span id="fr_843"></span>[844](#fn_843.md)
malefactors, sacrilegious persons, and such like; especially when there
was no one of the good stars looking on.  But again Mars himself, having
a quarterly position with respect to Venus, in a direction toward the
centre, while no good star looks on, produces adulterers and incestuous
persons.  Venus with the Moon, in the borders and houses of Saturn, if
she was with Saturn, and Mars looking on, produces women that are
viragos, ready for agriculture, building, and every manly work, to
commit adultery with whom they please, and not to be convicted by their
husbands, to use no delicacy, no ointments, nor feminine robes and
shoes, but to live after the fashion of men.  But the unpropitious Venus
makes men to be as women, and not to act in any respect as men, if she
is with Mars in Aries; on the contrary, she produces women if she is in
Capricorn or Aquarius.”
