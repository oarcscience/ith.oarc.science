<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.vii.vi-p2"></A>Then I said:&#160; &#8220;If our lord Peter did not know that he himself alone can prevail against this power, he would not have sent us before him with orders to get information secretly concerning Simon, and to write to him.&#8221;&#160; Then, as evening had come on, we took supper,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1031"></A><A HREF="#fn_1031"><FONT SIZE="1">1032</FONT></A>
 and went to sleep.&#160; But in the morning, one of Bernice&#146;s friends came and said that Simon had set sail for Sidon, and that he had left behind him Appion Pleistonices,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1032"></A><A HREF="#fn_1032"><FONT SIZE="1">1033</FONT></A>
&#8212;a man of Alexandria, a <A NAME="page_253"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 253</FONT></A> <a name="vi.iv.vii.vi-Page_253"></A>grammarian by profession, whom I knew as being a friend of my father; and a certain astrologer, Annubion the Diospolitan, and Athenodorus the Athenian, attached to the doctrine of Epicurus.&#160; And we, having learned these things concerning Simon, in the morning wrote and despatched a letter to Peter, and went to take a walk.</p>
