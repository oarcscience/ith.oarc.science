id="vi.iv.xv.xxxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXII.—The Golden Rule.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xv.xxxii-p2"></span>“But he is righteous who for the
sake of what is reasonable fights with nature.  For example, it is
natural to all to love those who love them.  But the righteous man tries
also to love his enemies and to bless those who slander him, and even to
pray for his enemies, and to compassionate those who do him wrong. 
Wherefore also he refrains from doing wrong, and blesses those who curse
him, pardons those who strike him, and submits to those who persecute
him, and salutes those who do not salute him, shares such things as he
has with those who have not, persuades him that is angry with him,
conciliates his enemy, exhorts the disobedient, instructs the
unbelieving, comforts the mourner; being distressed, he endures; being
ungratefully treated, he is not angry.  But having devoted himself to
love his neighbour as himself, he is not afraid of poverty, but becomes
poor by sharing his possessions with those who have none.  But neither
does he punish the sinner.  For he who loves his neighbour as himself,
as he knows that when he has sinned he does not wish to be punished, so
neither does he punish those who sin.  And as he wishes to be praised,
and blessed, and honoured, and to have all his sins forgiven, thus he
does to his neighbour, loving him as himself. <span
id="fr_1153"></span>[1154](#fn_1153)   In one word, what he wishes for
himself, he wishes also for his neighbour.  For this is the law of God
and of the prophets <span id="fr_1154"></span>[1155](#fn_1154) this is
the doctrine of truth.  And this perfect love towards every man is the
male part of philanthropy, but the female part of it is compassion; that
is, to feed the hungry, to give drink to the thirsty, to clothe the
naked, to visit the sick, to take in the stranger, to show herself to,
and help to the utmost of her power, him who is in prison, <span
id="fr_1155"></span>[1156](#fn_1155) and, in short, to have compassion
on him who is in misfortune.”
