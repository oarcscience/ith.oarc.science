<span id="viii.v.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="viii.v.vii-p1.1"></span>VI.</span>

<span id="viii.v.vii-p2"></span>Of the engagement made in baptism, and
of those who have given themselves to the life in common.

<span id="viii.v.vii-p3"></span>And in exhorting you, we also admonish
all who have embraced the faith of Christ, and who have taken from
Christ the name of Christian, that ye make your Christianity vain in no
respect, but keep stedfastly the engagement which ye took upon
yourselves in baptism, so that ye may be found not reprobate, but worthy
in His presence.  And if any one of you has entered the life which has
all things common, and has taken the vow to hold no private property,
let him see to it that he make not his promise vain, but let him keep
with all faithfulness this engagement which he has made to the Lord, so
that he may acquire for himself not damnation, but a reward; for it is
better for a man not to take a vow at all than not to discharge to the
best of his ability the vow that he has made.  For they who have made a
vow, or taken on them the faith, and have not kept their vow, or have
carried out their life in things evil, are punished more severely than
those who have carried out their life without a vow, or have died
without faith, but not without doing good works.  For to this end have
we received a reasonable mind by the gift of nature, and the renewal
also of the second birth, that, according to the apostle, we may discern
(*sapiamus*) rather things above, and not things on the earth; <span
id="fr_2771"></span>[2772](#fn_2771.md) for the wisdom of this world is
foolishness with God. <span id="fr_2772"></span>[2773](#fn_2772.md)   For
to what, most dearly beloved, does the wisdom of this world urge us, but
to seek things that are hurtful, and to love things that are to perish,
and to neglect things that are healthful, and to esteem as of no value
things that are lasting?  It commends the love of money, of which it is
said, The love of money is the root of all evil; <span
id="fr_2773"></span>[2774](#fn_2773.md) and which has this evil in
especial, that while it obtrudes the transitory, it hides from view the
eternal; and while it looks on things that are outside, it does not look
in upon things that lurk within; and while it seeks after strange
things, it is an evil that makes itself strange to him who does
it. <span id="fr_2774"></span>[2775](#fn_2774.md)   Behold, to what does
the wisdom of this world urge a man?  To live in pleasures.  Whence it
is said:  A widow that liveth in pleasure, is dead while she
liveth. <span id="fr_2775"></span>[2776](#fn_2775.md)   It urges a man to
feed the flesh with the softest delights, with sins, and vices, and
flames, to press the soul with intemperance in food and wine, and to
check the life of the spirit, and to put into his enemy’s hand the sword
to be used against himself.  Behold, what is the counsel which the
wisdom of this world gives?  That those who are good should choose
rather to be evil, and that in error of mind they should be zealous to
be sinners, and should not bethink themselves of that terrible voice of
God, when the wicked shall be burned up like grass. <span
