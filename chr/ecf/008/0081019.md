Continued.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xvi.xiv-p2"></span>“But some one will say, ‘How many
have perished on account of chastity!’  Yes; but it was because they did
not perceive the danger.  For the woman who perceives that she is in
love with any one, or is beloved by any one, should immediately shun all
association with him as she would shun a blazing fire or a mad dog.  And
this is exactly what your mother did, for she really loved chastity as a
blessing:  wherefore she was preserved, and, along with you, obtained
the full knowledge of the everlasting kingdom.  The woman who wishes to
be chaste, ought to know that she is envied by wickedness, and that
because of love many lie in wait for her.  If, then, she remain holy
through a stedfast persistence in chastity, she will gain the victory
over all temptations, and be saved; whereas, even if she were to do all
that is right, and yet should once commit the sin of adultery, she must
be punished, as said the prophet.
