<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.xii.viii-p2"></A>Then my father answered:&#160; &#8220;But as the harmfulness of an inharmonious conjunction of elements or stars is immediately betrayed, so ought also adultery to be immediately shown that it is an evil.&#8221;&#160; Then I:&#160; &#8220;First tell me this, whether, as you yourself have confessed, evils are produced from incongruous and inharmonious mixture; and then after that we shall inquire into the other matter.&#8221;&#160; Then my father said:&#160; &#8220;The nature of things is as you say, my son.&#8221;&#160; Then I answered:&#160; &#8220;Since, then, you wish to learn of these things, see how many things there are which no one doubts to be evils.&#160; Do you think that a fever, a fire, sedition, the fall of a house, murder, holds, racks, pains, mournings, and such like, are evils?&#8221;&#160; Then said my father:&#160; &#8220;It is true, my son, that these things are evil, and very evil; or, at all events, whoever denies that they are evil, let him suffer them!&#8221;</p>
