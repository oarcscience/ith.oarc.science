<span id="vi.iii.x.viii-p2"></span>When the old man had said this, I
Clement said to him:  “Hear, my father:  if my brother Niceta bring you
to acknowledge that the world is not governed without the providence of
God, I shall be able to answer you in that part which remains concerning
the *genesis*; for I am well acquainted with this doctrine.”  And when I
had thus spoken, my brother Aquila said:  “What is the use of our
calling him *father*, when we are commanded to call no man father upon
earth?” <span id="fr_811"></span>[812](#fn_811)   Then, looking to the
old man, he said, “Do not take it amiss, my father, that I have found
fault with my brother for calling you *father*, for we have a precept
not to call any one by that name.”  When Aquila said that, all the
assembly of the bystanders, as well as the old man and Peter, <span

id="vi.iii.x.viii-Page_168"></span>laughed.  And when Aquila asked the
reason of their all laughing, I said to him:  “Because you yourself do
the very thing which you find fault with in another; for you called the
old man *father*.”  But he denied it, saying:  “I am not aware that I
called him *father*.”  Meantime Peter was moved with certain
suspicions, <span id="fr_812"></span>[813](#fn_812) as he told us
afterwards; and looking to Niceta, he said, “Go on with what you have
proposed.”
