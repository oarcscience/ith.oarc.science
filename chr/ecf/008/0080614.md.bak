<span id="vi.iv.iv.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.iv.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.—More Perplexity.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.iv.iv-p2"></span>And again, living in doubt, I said to
myself, Why do I labour in vain, when the matter is clear, that if I
lose existence when I die, it is not fitting that I should distress
myself now while I do exist?  Wherefore I shall reserve my grief till
that *day*, when, ceasing to exist, I shall not be affected with grief. 
But if I am to exist, what <span id="page_224">p. 224</span> <span
id="vi.iv.iv.iv-Page_224"></span>does it profit me now to distress
myself gratuitously?  And immediately after this another reasoning
assailed me; for I said, Shall I not have something worse to suffer then
than that which distresses me now, if I have not lived piously; and
shall I not be delivered over, according to the doctrines of some
philosophers, to Pyriphlegethon and Tartarus, like Sisyphus, or Tityus,
or Ixion, or Tantalus, and be punished for ever in Hades?  But again I
replied, saying:  But there are no such things as these.  Yet again I
said:  But if there be?  Therefore, said I, since the matter is
uncertain, the safer plan is for me rather to live piously.  But how
shall I be able, for the sake of righteousness, to subdue bodily
pleasures, looking, as I do, to an uncertain hope?  But I am neither
fully persuaded what is that righteous thing that is pleasing to God,
nor do I know whether the soul is immortal or mortal.  Neither can I
find any well-established doctrine, nor can I abstain from such
debatings.
