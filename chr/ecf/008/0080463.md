<span id="vi.iii.x.lvii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iii.x.lvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter LVII.—The Old Man
Unconvinced.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.x.lvii-p2"></span>Then the old man:  “Do not take
amiss, my son, what I am going to say.  Though your words are powerful,
yet they cannot lead me to believe that anything can be done apart from
<span class="c9"><span id="vi.iii.x.lvii-p2.1"></span>Genesis</span>. 
For I know that all things have happened to me by the necessity of <span
class="c9"><span id="vi.iii.x.lvii-p2.2"></span>Genesis</span>, <span
id="fr_827"></span>[828](#fn_827.md) and therefore I cannot be persuaded
that either to do well or to do ill is in our power; and if we have not
our actions in our power, it cannot be believed that there is a judgment
to come, by which either punishments may be inflicted on the evil, or
rewards bestowed on the good.  In short, since I see that you are
initiated in this sort of learning, I shall lay before you a few things
from the art itself.”  “If,” says Aquila, “you wish to add anything from
that science, my <span id="page_181">p. 181</span> <span
id="vi.iii.x.lvii-Page_181"></span>brother Clement will answer you with
all care, since he has attended more fully to the science of
mathematics.  For I can maintain in other ways that our actions are in
our own power; but I ought not to presume upon those things which I have
not learned.”
