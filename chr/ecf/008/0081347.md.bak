id="vii.xxi-p1.1"></span>The Giving Up of Pontius Pilate.</span>

<span id="vii.xxi-p2"></span> ————————————

<span id="vii.xxi-p3"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.xxi-p3.1"></span>And</span> the writings having come to the city
of the Romans, and having been read to the Cæsar, with not a few
standing by, all were astounded, because through the wickedness of
Pilate the darkness and the earthquake had come over the whole world. 
And the Cæsar, filled with rage, sent soldiers, and ordered them to
bring Pilate a prisoner.

<span id="vii.xxi-p4"></span>And when he was brought to the city of the
Romans, the Cæsar, hearing that Pilate had arrived, sat in the temple of
the gods, in the presence of all the senate, and with all the army, and
all the multitude of his power; and he ordered Pilate to stand
forward. <span id="fr_2023"></span>[2024](#fn_2023.md)   And the Cæsar says
to him:  Why hast thou, O most impious, dared to do such things, having
seen so great miracles in that man?  By daring to do an evil deed, thou
hast destroyed the whole world.

<span id="vii.xxi-p6"></span>And Pilate said:  O almighty <span
id="fr_2024"></span>[2025](#fn_2024.md) king, I am innocent of these
things; but the multitude of the Jews are violent and guilty.  And the
Cæsar said:  And who are they?  Pilate says:  Herod, Archelaus, Philip,
Annas and Caiaphas, and all the multitude of the Jews.  The Cæsar says: 
For what reason didst thou follow out their counsel?  And Pilate says: 
Their nation is rebellious and insubmissive, not submitting themselves
to thy power.  And the Cæsar said:  When they delivered him to thee,
thou oughtest to have made him secure, and to have sent him to me, and
not to have obeyed them in crucifying such a man, righteous as he was,
and one that did such good miracles, as thou hast said in thy report. 
For from such miracles Jesus was manifestly the Christ, the King of the
Jews.

<span id="vii.xxi-p8"></span>And as the Cæsar was thus speaking, when he
named the name of Christ, all the multitude of the gods fell down in a
body, and became as dust, where the Cæsar was sitting with the senate. 
And the people standing beside the Cæsar all began to tremble, on
account of the speaking of the word, and the fall of their gods; and
being seized with terror, they all went away, each to his own house,
wondering at what had happened.  And the Cæsar ordered Pilate to be kept
in security, in order that he might know the truth about Jesus.

<span id="vii.xxi-p9"></span>And on the following day, the Cæsar,
sitting in the Capitol with all the senate, tried again to question
Pilate.  And the Cæsar says:  Tell the truth, O most impious, because
through thy impious action which thou hast perpetrated against Jesus,
even here the doing of thy wicked deeds has been shown by the gods
having been cast down.  Say, then, who is he that has been crucified;
because even his name has destroyed all the gods?  Pilate said:  And
indeed the records of him are true; for assuredly I myself was persuaded
from his works that he was greater than all the gods whom we worship. 
And the Cæsar said:  For what reason, then, didst thou bring against him
such audacity and such doings, if thou wert not ignorant of him, and
altogether devising mischief against my kingdom?  Pilate said:  On
account of the wickedness and rebellion of the lawless and ungodly Jews,
I did this.

<span id="vii.xxi-p10"></span>And the Cæsar, being filled with rage,
held a council with all his senate and his power, and ordered a decree
to be written against the Jews as follows:—To Licianus, the governor of
the chief places of the East, greeting.  The reckless deed which has
been done at the present time by the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the
cities of the Jews round about, and their wicked action, has come to my
knowledge, that they have forced Pilate to crucify a certain god named
Jesus, and on account of this great fault of theirs the world has been
darkened and dragged to destruction.  Do thou then speedily, with a
multitude of soldiers, go to them there, and make them prisoners, in
accordance with this decree.  Be obedient, and take action against them,
and scatter them, and make them slaves among all the nations; and having
driven them out of the whole of Judæa, make them the smallest of
nations, so that it may not any longer be seen at all, because they are
full of wickedness. <span id="fr_2025"></span>[2026](#fn_2025.md)

<span id="vii.xxi-p12"></span>And this decree having come into the
region of the East, Licianus, obeying from fear of the decree, seized
all the nation of the Jews; and those that were left in Judæa he
scattered among the nations, and sold for slaves: <span
id="fr_2026"></span>[2027](#fn_2026.md)   so that it was known to the Cæsar
that these things had been <span id="page_465">p. 465</span> <span
id="vii.xxi-Page_465"></span>done by Licianus against the Jews in the
region of the East; and it pleased him.

<span id="vii.xxi-p14"></span>And again the Cæsar set himself to
question Pilate; and he orders a captain named Albius to cut off
Pilate’s head, saying:  Just as he laid hands upon the just man named
Christ, in like manner also shall he fall, and not find safety.

<span id="vii.xxi-p15"></span>And Pilate, going away to the place,
prayed in silence, saying:  Lord, do not destroy me along with the
wicked Hebrews, because I would not have laid hands upon Thee, except
for the nation of the lawless Jews, because they were exciting rebellion
against me.  But Thou knowest that I did it in ignorance.  Do not then
destroy me for this my sin; but remember not evil against me, O Lord,
and against Thy servant Procla, who is standing with me in this the hour
of my death, whom Thou didst appoint to prophesy that Thou shouldest be
nailed to the cross.  Do not condemn her also in my sin; but pardon us,
and make us to be numbered in the portion of Thy righteous.

<span id="vii.xxi-p16"></span>And, behold, when Pilate had finished his
prayer, there came a voice out of the heaven, saying:  All the
generations and families of the nations shall count thee blessed,
because under thee have been fulfilled all those things said about me by
the prophets; and thou thyself shall be seen as my witness at my second
appearing, when I shall judge the twelve tribes of Israel, and those
that have not owned my name.  And the prefect struck off the head of
Pilate; and, behold, an angel of the Lord received it.  And his wife
Procla, seeing the angel coming and receiving his head, being filled
with joy herself also, immediately gave up the ghost, and was buried
along with her husband. <span id="fr_2027"></span>[2028](#fn_2027.md)
