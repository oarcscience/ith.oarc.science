Hatred.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.viii.xxvii-p2"></span>“When Appion heard the pretended
answer, he said:  ‘Is it without reason that I hate the Jews?  Here now
some Jew has fallen in with her, and has converted her to his religion,
and persuaded her to chastity, and it is henceforth impossible that she
ever have intercourse with another man; for these fellows, setting God
before them as the universal inspector of actions, are extremely
persistent in chastity, as being unable to be concealed from Him.’
