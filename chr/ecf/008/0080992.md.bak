<span id="vi.iv.xv.xxi-p2"></span>While Peter thus spoke, the woman, who
had listened attentively, swooned away as if in stupor.  But Peter
approached her, and caught hold of her, and exhorted her to restrain
herself, persuading her to confess what was the matter with her.  But
she, being powerless in the rest of her body, as through intoxication,
turned her *head* round, being able to sustain the greatness of the
hoped for joy, and rubbing her face:  “Where,” said she, “is this
youth?”  And he, now seeing through the whole affair, said, “Tell me
first; for otherwise you cannot see him.”  Then she earnestly said, “I
am that youth’s mother.”  Then said Peter, “What is his name?”  And she
said, “Clement.”  Then Peter said, “It is the same, and he it was that
spoke to me a little while ago, whom I ordered to wait for me in the
boat.  And she, falling at Peter’s feet, entreated him to make haste to
come to the boat.  Then Peter, “If you will keep terms with me, I shall
do so.”  Then she said, “I will do anything; only show me my only
child.  For I shall seem to see in him my two children who died here.” 
Then Peter said, “When ye see him, be quiet, until we depart from the
island.”  And she said, “I will.”
