<span id="vi.iii.iii.xi-p2"></span>At length I said to him, “Only
expound to me the doctrine of that man who you say has appeared, and I
will arrange your sayings in my language, and will preach the kingdom
and righteousness of Almighty God; and after that, if you wish it, I
shall even sail along with you, for I am extremely desirous to see
Judæa, and perhaps I shall remain with you always.”  To this he
answered, “If indeed you wish to see our country, and to learn those
things which you desire, set sail with me even now; or, if there be
anything that detains you now, I shall leave with you directions to my
dwelling, so that when you please to come you may easily find me; for
tomorrow I shall set out on my journey.”  When I saw him determined, I
went down with him to the harbour, and carefully took from him the
directions which he gave me to find his dwelling.  I told him that, but
for the necessity of getting some money which was due to me, I should
not at all delay, but that I should speedily follow him.  Having told
him this, I commended him to the kindness of those who had charge of the
ship, and returned sad; for I was possessed of the memory of the
intercourse which I had had with an excellent guest and a choice friend.
