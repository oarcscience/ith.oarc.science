<span id="vii.v.xxxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vii.v.xxxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 37.</span>

<span id="vii.v.xxxviii-p2"></span>Now Joseph <span
id="fr_1681"></span>[1682](#fn_1681) was a carpenter, and used to make
nothing else of wood but ox-yokes, and ploughs, and implements of
husbandry, and wooden beds.  And it came to pass that a certain young
man ordered him to make for him a couch six cubits long.  And Joseph
commanded his servant <span id="fr_1682"></span>[1683](#fn_1682) to cut
the wood with an iron saw, according to the measure which he had sent. 
But he did not keep to the prescribed measure, but made one piece of
wood shorter than the other.  And Joseph was in perplexity, and began to
consider what he was to do about this.  And when Jesus saw him in this
state of cogitation, seeing that it was a matter of impossibility to
him, He addresses him with words of comfort, saying:  Come, let us take
hold of the ends of the pieces of wood, and let us put them together,
end to end, and let us fit them exactly to each other, and draw to us,
for we shall be able to make them equal.  Then Joseph did what he was
bid, for he knew that He could do whatever He wished.  And Joseph took
hold of the ends of the pieces of wood, and brought them together
against the wall next himself, and Jesus took hold of the other ends of
the pieces of wood, and drew the shorter piece to Him, and made it of
the same length as the longer one.  And He said to Joseph:  Go and work,
and do what thou hast promised to do.  And Joseph did what he had
promised. <span id="fr_1683"></span>[1684](#fn_1683)

was with other children He repeatedly went up and sat down upon a
balcony, and many of them began to do likewise, and they fell down and
broke their legs and arms.  And the Lord Jesus healed them all.
