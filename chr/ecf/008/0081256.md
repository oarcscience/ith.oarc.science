id="vii.xii.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 3.</span>

<span id="vii.xii.iv-p2"></span>And Pilate, filled with rage, went
outside of the prætorium, and said to them:  I take the sun to
witness <span id="fr_1817"></span>[1818](#fn_1817) that I find no fault
in this man.  The Jews answered and said to the procurator:  Unless this
man were an evil-doer, we should not have delivered him to thee.  And
Pilate said, Do you take him, and judge him according to your law.  The
Jews said to Pilate:  It is not lawful for us to put any one to death. 
Pilate said:  Has God said that you are not to put to death, but that I
am?

<span id="vii.xii.iv-p4"></span>And Pilate went again into the
prætorium, and spoke to Jesus privately, and said to Him:  Art thou the
king of the Jews?  Jesus answered Pilate:  Dost thou say this of
thyself, or have others said it to thee of me?  Pilate answered Jesus: 
Am I also a Jew? <span id="fr_1818"></span>[1819](#fn_1818)   Thy nation
and the chief priests have given thee up to me.  What hast thou done? 
Jesus answered:  My kingdom is not of this world; for if my kingdom were
of this world, my servants would fight in order that I should not be
given up to the Jews:  but now my kingdom is not from thence.  Pilate
said to Him:  Art thou then a king?  Jesus answered him:  Thou sayest
that I am a king.  Because for this have I been born, and have I come,
in order that every one who is of the truth might hear my voice.  Pilate
says to him:  What is truth?  Jesus says to him:  Truth is from heaven. 
Pilate says:  Is truth not upon earth?  Jesus says to Pilate:  Thou
seest how those who speak the truth are judged by those that have the
power upon earth.

<span id="vii.xii.iv-p3"></span> See *Apost. Const*., ii. 56.  At last
he who is going to pronounce sentence of death upon the culprit raises
his hands aloft, and takes the sun to witness that he is innocent of his
blood.

You do not mean to say that I too am a Jew?
