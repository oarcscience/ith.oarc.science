id="vi.iii.x.xxx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXX.—Breath and Blood.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.x.xxx-p2"></span>“The nostrils also are made for the
purpose of collecting, inspiring, and expiring air, that by the renewal
of the breath, the natural heat which is in the heart may, by means of
the lungs, be either warmed or cooled, as the occasion may require;
while the lungs are made to abide in the breast, that by their softness
they may soothe and cherish the vigour of the heart, in which the life
seems to abide;—the life, I say, not the soul.  And what shall I say of
the substance of the blood, which, proceeding as a river from a
fountain, and first borne along in one channel, and then spreading
through innumerable veins, as through canals, irrigates the whole
territory of the human body with vital streams, being supplied by the
agency of the liver, which is placed in the right side, for effecting
the digestion of food and turning it into blood?  But in the left side
is placed the spleen, which draws to itself, and in some way cleanses,
the impurities of the blood.
