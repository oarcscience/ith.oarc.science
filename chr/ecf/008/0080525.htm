 that this, through a long time solidifying its outer parts, made bounds to itself and a sort of foundation, being gathered, as it were, into the manner and form of a huge egg, within which, in the course of a long time, as within the shell of the egg, there was cherished and vivified a certain animal; and that afterwards, that huge globe being broken, there came forth a certain kind of man of double sex, which they call masculo-feminine.&#160; This they called Phanetas, from appearing, because when it appeared, they say, then also light shone forth.&#160; And from this, they say that there were produced substance, prudence, motion, and coition, and from these the heavens and the earth were made.&#160; From the heaven they say that six males were produced, whom they call Titans; and in like manner, from the earth six females, whom they called Titanides.&#160; And these are the names of the males who sprang from the heaven:&#160; Oceanus, C&#339;us, Crios, Hyperion, Iapetus, Chronos, who amongst us is called Saturn.&#160; In like manner, the names of the females who sprang from the earth are these:&#160; Theia, Rhea, Themis, Mnemosyne, Tethys, Hebe.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_862"></A><A HREF="#fn_862"><FONT SIZE="1">863</FONT></A>
