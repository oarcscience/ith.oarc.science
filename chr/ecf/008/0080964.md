id="vi.iv.xiv.xxx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXX.—“Whatsoever Things are
Pure.”</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xiv.xxx-p2"></span>“But who is there to whom it is not
manifest that it is better not to have intercourse with a woman in her
separation, but purified and washed.  And also after copulation it is
proper to wash.  But if you grudge to do this, recall to mind how you
followed after the parts of purity when you served senseless idols; and
be ashamed that now, when it is necessary to attain, I say not more, but
to attain the one and whole of purity, you are more slothful.  Consider,
therefore, Him who made you, and you will understand who He is that
casts upon you this sluggishness with respect to purity.
