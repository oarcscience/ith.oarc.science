<span id="vi.iii.vi.xxviii-p2"></span>“But the foolish men who were
then, whereas they ought to have abandoned the opinion which they had
conceived of him, inasmuch as they had seen it confuted by his mortal
punishment, extolled him the more.  For raising a sepulchre to his
honour, they went so far as to adore him as a friend of God, and one who
had been removed to heaven in a chariot of lightning, and to worship him
as if he were a living star.  Hence also his name was called Zoroaster
after his death—that is, *living star*—by those who, after one
generation, had been taught to speak the Greek language.  In fine, by
this example, even now many worship those who have been struck with
lightning, honouring them with sepulchres, and worshipping them as
friends of God.  But this man was born in the fourteenth generation, and
died in the fifteenth, in which the tower was built, and the languages
of men were divided into many.
