id="vi.iii.v.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIII.—Simon a Seducer.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.v.iii-p2"></span>While Simon was talking on in this
style, Peter, having saluted the people in his usual way, thus
answered:  “O Simon, his own conscience is sufficient for every one to
confute him; but if you wonder at this, that those who are acquainted
with you not only do not love you but even hate you, learn the reason
from me.  Since you are a seducer you profess to proclaim the truth; and
on this account you had many friends who had a desire to learn the
truth.  But when they saw in you things contrary to what you professed,
they being, as I said, lovers of truth, began not only not to love you,
but even to hate you.  But yet they did not immediately forsake you,
because you still promised that you could show them what is true.  As
long, therefore, as no one was present who could show them, they bore
with you; but since the hope of better instruction has dawned upon them,
they despise you, and seek to know what they understand to be better. 
And you indeed, acting by nefarious arts, thought at first that you
should escape detection.  But <span id="page_118">p. 118</span> <span
id="vi.iii.v.iii-Page_118"></span>you are detected.  For you are driven
into a corner, and, contrary to your expectation, you are made
notorious, not only as being ignorant of the truth, but as being
unwilling to hear it from those who know it.  For if you had been
willing to hear, that saying would have been exemplified in you, of Him
who said that ‘there is nothing hidden which shall not be known, nor
covered which shall not be disclosed.’” <span
