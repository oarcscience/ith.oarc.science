<span id="vi.iv.vii.i-p3"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iv.vii.i-p3.1"></span>Thus</span> I Clement, departing from
Cæsarea Stratonis, together with Nicetas and Aquila, entered into Tyre
of Phœnicia; <span id="fr_1029"></span>[1030](#fn_1029) and according to
the injunction of Peter, who sent us, we lodged with Bernice, the
daughter of Justa the Canaanitess.  She received us most joyfully; and
striving with much honour towards me, and with affection towards Aquila
and Nicetas, and speaking freely as a friend, through joy she treated us
courteously, and hospitably urged us to take bodily refreshment. 
Perceiving, therefore, that she was endeavouring to impose a short delay
upon us, I said:  “You do well, indeed, to busy yourself in fulfilling
the part of love; but the fear of our God must take the precedence of
this.  For, having a combat on hand on behalf of many souls, we are
afraid of preferring our own ease before their salvation.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.i-p4"></span> \[In the *Recognitions* (iv. 1)
mention is made of Clement and others accompanying Peter to Dora,
Ptolemais, Tyre, Sidon, and Berytus (Beyrout), but no record is made of
any discourses.  In Homilies IV.–VII. the details of this journey are
given, but with variation in some particulars.  These *Homilies* are
peculiar, in form, to this work; but much of the matter occurs in the
*Recognitions*, in the final discussion with the father of Clement.—R.\]
