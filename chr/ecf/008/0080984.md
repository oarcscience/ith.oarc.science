id="vi.iv.xv.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIII.—A Woman of a Sorrowful
Spirit.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xv.xiii-p2"></span>But Peter alone did not think it
worth while to look at the sights that were there; but noticing a
certain woman sitting outside before the doors, begging constantly for
her support, he said to her, “O woman, is any of your limbs <span

id="vi.iv.xv.xiii-Page_295"></span>defective, that you submit to such
disgrace—I mean that of begging,—and do not rather work with the hands
which God has given you, and procure your daily food?”  But she,
groaning, answered, “Would that I had hands able to work!  But now they
retain only the form of hands, being dead and rendered useless by my
gnawing of them.”  Then Peter asked her, “What is the cause of your
suffering so terribly?”  And she answered, “Weakness of soul; and nought
else.  For if I had the mind of a man, there was a precipice or a pool
whence I should have thrown myself, and have been able to rest from my
tormenting misfortunes.”
