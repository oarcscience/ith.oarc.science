id="vi.iii.ix.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI.—Different Effects of Suffering
on Heathens and Christians.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.ix.xi-p2"></span>Peter, hearing this, shed tears of
sympathy, and said to his friends who were present:  “If any man who is
a worshipper of God had endured what this man’s father has endured,
immediately men would assign his religion as the cause of his
calamities; but when these things happen to miserable Gentiles, they
charge their misfortunes upon fate.  I call them miserable, because they
are both vexed with errors here, and are deprived of future hope;
whereas, when the worshippers of God suffer these things, their patient
endurance of them contributes to their cleansing from sin.”
