<span id="vii.v.xxxiv-p2"></span>Now Jesus was six years old, and His
mother sent Him with a pitcher to the fountain to draw water with the
children.  And it came to pass, after He had drawn the water, that one
of the children came against Him, and struck the pitcher, and broke it. 
But Jesus stretched out the cloak which He had on, and took up in His
cloak as much water as there had been in the pitcher, and carried it to
His mother.  And when she saw it she wondered, and reflected within
herself, and laid up all these things in her heart. <span
