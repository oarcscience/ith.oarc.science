<span id="v.iv.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVI.—Exhortation to Union and to
Obedience; Conclusion.</span>

<span id="v.iv.xvi-p2"></span>Therefore, we beseech you, our brethren in
our Lord, that these things be observed with you, as with us, and that
we may be of the same mind, that we may be one in you and ye may be one
in us, and that in everything we may be *of* one soul and one heart in
our Lord.  Whosoever knoweth the Lord heareth us; and every one <span
id="page_66">p. 66</span> <span id="v.iv.xvi-Page_66"></span>who is not
of God heareth not us.  He who desires truly to keep sanctity heareth
us; and the virgin who truly desires to keep virginity heareth us; but
she who does not truly desire to keep virginity doth not hear us. 
Finally, farewell in our Lord, and rejoice in the Lord, all ye saints. 
Peace and joy be with you from God the Father through Jesus Christ our
Lord.  So be it.

<span id="v.iv.xvi-p3"></span>*Here* endeth the Second Epistle of
Clement, the disciple of Peter.  His prayer be with us!  So be it.
