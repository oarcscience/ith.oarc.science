<span id="vi.iii.iv.lxiii-p2"></span>Then Peter:  “In short, when I did
not perceive, through the occupation of my mind, that I had caught a
very large fish which was attached to the hook, and that although it was
dragging the hook-line from my hand, my brother Andrew, who was sitting
by me, seeing me in a reverie and almost ready to fall, thrusting his
elbow into my side as if he would awaken me from sleep, said:  ‘Do you
not see, Peter, what a large fish you have caught?  Are you out of your
senses, that you are thus in a stupor of astonishment?  Tell me, What is
the matter with you?’  But I was angry with him for a little, because he
had withdrawn me from the delight of those things which I was
contemplating; then I answered that I was not suffering from any malady,
but that I was mentally gazing on the beloved Jerusalem, and at the same
time on Cæsarea; and <span id="page_115">p. 115</span> <span
id="vi.iii.iv.lxiii-Page_115"></span>that, while I was indeed with him
in the body, in my mind I was wholly carried away thither.  But he, I
know not whence inspired, uttered a hidden and secret word of truth.”
