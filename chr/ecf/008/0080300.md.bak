Evil.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.vi.xxiv-p2"></span>“But you will meet me by saying,
Even if it has come to this through freedom of will, was the Creator
ignorant that those whom He created would fall away into evil?  He ought
therefore not to have created those who, He foresaw, would deviate from
the path of righteousness.  Now we tell those who ask such questions,
that the purpose of assertions of the sort made by us is to show why the
wickedness of those who as yet were not, did not prevail over the
goodness of the Creator. <span id="fr_737"></span>[738](#fn_737.md)   For
if, wishing to fill up the number and measure of His creation, He had
been afraid of the wickedness of those who were to be, and like one who
could find no other way of remedy and cure, except only this, that He
should refrain from His purpose of creating, lest the wickedness of
those who were to be should be ascribed to Him; what else would this
show but unworthy suffering and unseemly feebleness on the part of the
Creator, who should so fear the actings of those who as yet were not,
that He refrained from His purposed creation?

<span id="fn_737"></span>[140:738](0080300.htm#fr_737.md) <span
id="vi.iii.vi.xxiv-p2.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iii.vi.xxiv-p3"></span> There is considerable variety of
reading in this sentence, and the precise meaning is somewhat obscure. 
The general sense, however, is sufficiently evident, that if God had
refrained from creating those who He foresaw, would fall into evil, this
would have been to subject His goodness to their evil.
