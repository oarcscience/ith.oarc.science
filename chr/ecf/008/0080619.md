<span id="vi.iv.iv.ix-p2"></span>And when I said that I wished I could
meet with some one of those who had seen Him, they immediately brought
me to one, saying, “There is one here who not only is acquainted with
Him, but is also of that country, a Hebrew, by name Barnabas, who says
that he himself is one of His disciples; and hereabouts he resides, and
readily announces to those who will the terms of His promise.”  Then I
went with them; and when I came, I stood listening to his words with the
crowd that stood round him; and I perceived that he was speaking the
truth not with dialectic art, but was setting forth simply and without
preparation what he had heard and seen the manifested Son of God do and
say.  And even from the crowd who stood around him he produced many
witnesses of the miracles and discourses which he narrated.
