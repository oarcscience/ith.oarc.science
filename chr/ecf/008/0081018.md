<span id="vi.iv.xvi.xiii-p2"></span>That same evening we all enjoyed the
benefit of Peter’s instruction.  Taking occasion by what had happened to
our mother, he showed us how the results of chastity are good, while
those of adultery are disastrous, and naturally bring destruction on the
whole race, if not speedily, at all events slowly. <span
id="fr_1175"></span>[1176](#fn_1175.md)   “And to such an extent,” he says,
“do deeds of chastity please God, that in this life He bestows some
small favour on account of it, even on those who are in error; for
salvation in the other world is granted only to those who have been
baptized on account of their trust <span
id="fr_1176"></span>[1177](#fn_1176.md) in Him, and who act chastely and
righteously.  This ye yourselves have seen in the case of your mother,
that the results of chastity are in the end good.  For perhaps she would
have been cut off if she had committed adultery; but God took pity on
her for having behaved chastely, rescued her from the death that
threatened her, and restored to her her lost children.
