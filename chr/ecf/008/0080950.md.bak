<span id="vi.iv.xiv.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.xiv.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVI.—All Things Work for Good to
Them that Love God.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xiv.xvi-p2"></span>“But no one of us can suffer such a
thing; but they themselves are punished by us, when, having entered into
any one, they entreat us that they may go out slowly.  But some one will
say perhaps, Even some of the worshippers of God fall under such
sufferings.  I say that is impossible.  For he is a worshipper of God,
of whom I speak, who is truly pious, not one who is such only in name,
but who really performs the deeds of the law that has been given him. 
If any one acts impiously, he is not pious; in like manner as, if he who
is of another tribe keeps the law, he is a Jew; but he who does not keep
it is a Greek.  For the Jew believes God and keeps the law, by which
faith he removes also other sufferings, though like mountains and
heavy. <span id="fr_1129"></span>[1130](#fn_1129.md)   But he who keeps not
the law is manifestly a deserter through not believing God; and thus as
no Jew, but a sinner, he is on account of his sin brought into
subjection to those sufferings which are ordained for the punishment of
sinners.  For, by the will of God prescribed at the beginning,
punishment righteously follows those who worship Him on account of
transgressions; and this is so, in order that having reckoned with them
by punishment for sin as for a debt, he may set forth those who have
turned to Him pure in the universal judgment.  For as the wicked here
enjoy luxury to the loss of eternal blessings, so punishments are sent
upon the Jews who transgress for a settlement of accounts, that,
expiating their transgression here, they may there be set free from
eternal punishments.
