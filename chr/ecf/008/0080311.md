id="vi.iii.vi.xxxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXV.—False Apostles.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.vi.xxxv-p2"></span>“Wherefore observe the greatest
caution, that you believe no teacher, unless he bring from Jerusalem the
testimonial of James the Lord’s brother, or of whosoever may come after
him. <span id="fr_745"></span>[746](#fn_745)   For no one, unless he has
gone up thither, and there has been approved as a fit and faithful
teacher for preaching the word of Christ,—unless, I say, he brings a
testimonial thence, is by any means to be received.  But let neither
prophet nor apostle be looked for by you at this time, besides us.  For
there is one true Prophet, whose words we twelve apostles preach; for He
is the accepted year of God, having us apostles as His twelve months.
 But for what reason the world itself was made, or what diversities have
occurred in it, and why our Lord, coming for its restoration, has chosen
and sent us twelve apostles, shall be explained more at length at
another time.  Meantime He has commanded us to go forth to preach, and
to invite you to the supper of the heavenly King, which the Father hath
prepared for the marriage of His Son, and that we should give you
wedding garments, that is, the grace of baptism; <span
id="fr_746"></span>[747](#fn_746) which whosoever obtains, as a spotless
robe with which he is to enter to the supper of the King, ought to
beware that it be not in any part of it stained with sin, and so he be
rejected as unworthy and reprobate.
