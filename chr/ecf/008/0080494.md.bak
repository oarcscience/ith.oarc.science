<span id="vi.iii.xi.xxv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iii.xi.xxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXV.—Not Genesis, But
Free-Will.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.xi.xxv-p2"></span>“The Medes alone in all the world,
with the greatest care, throw men still breathing to be devoured by
dogs; yet they have not Mars with the Moon placed in Cancer all through
their daily <span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iii.xi.xxv-p2.1"></span>Genesis</span>.  The Indians burn their
dead, and the wives of the dead voluntarily offer themselves, and are
burned with them.  But all the Indian women who are burned alive have
not the Sun under the earth in nightly <span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iii.xi.xxv-p2.2"></span>Genesis</span>, with Mars in the regions
of Mars.  Very many of the Germans end their lives by the halter; but
all have not therefore the Moon with Hora begirt by Saturn and Mars. 
From all this it appears that the fear of the laws bears sway in every
country, and the freedom of will which is implanted in man by the Spirit
complies with the laws; and <span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iii.xi.xxv-p2.3"></span>Genesis</span> can neither compel the
Seres to commit murder, nor the Brahmans to eat flesh, nor the Persians
to shun incest, nor the Indians to refrain from burning, nor the Medes
from being devoured by dogs, nor the Parthians from having many wives,
nor the women of Mesopotamia from preserving their chastity, nor the
Greeks from athletic exercises, nor the Gallic boys from being abused;
nor can it compel the barbarious nations to be instructed in the studies
of the Greeks; but, as we have said, each nation observes its own laws
according to free-will, and annuls the decrees of <span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iii.xi.xxv-p2.4"></span>Genesis</span> by the strictness of laws.
