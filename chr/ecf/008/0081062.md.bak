<span id="vi.iv.xix.x-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.xix.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter X.—Peter’s Explanation of the
Apparent Contradictions of Scripture.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xix.x-p2"></span>And Peter said: “They do not lead
astray, but convict and bring to light the evil disposition against God
which lurks like a serpent in each one.  For the Scriptures lie before
each one like many divers types.  Each one, then, has his own
disposition like wax, and examining the Scriptures and finding
everything in them, he moulds his idea of God according to his wish,
laying upon them, as I said, his own disposition, which is like
wax. <span id="fr_1282"></span>[1283](#fn_1282.md)   Since, then, each one
finds in the Scriptures whatever opinion he wishes to have in regard to
God, for this reason he, *Simon*, moulds from them the forms <span
id="fr_1283"></span>[1284](#fn_1283.md) of many gods, while we moulded the
form of Him who truly exists, coming to the knowledge of the true type
from our own shape. <span id="fr_1284"></span>[1285](#fn_1284.md)   For
assuredly the soul within us is clothed with His image for immortality. 
If I abandon the parent <span id="page_315">p. 315</span> <span
id="vi.iv.xix.x-Page_315"></span>of this soul, it also will abandon me
to just judgment, making known the injustice by the very act of
daring; <span id="fr_1285"></span>[1286](#fn_1285.md) and as coming from
one who is just, it will justly abandon me; and so, as far as the soul
is concerned, I shall, after punishment, be destroyed, having abandoned
the help that comes from it.  But if there is another god, first let him
put on another form, another shape, in order that by the new shape of
the body I may recognise the new god.  But if he should change the
shape, does he thereby change the substance of the soul?  But if he
should change it also, then I am no longer myself, having become another
both in shape and in substance.  Let him, therefore, create others, if
there is another.  But there is not.  For if there had been, he would
have created.  But since he has not created, then let him, as
nonexistent, leave him who is really existent. <span
id="fr_1286"></span>[1287](#fn_1286.md)   For he is nobody, <span
id="fr_1287"></span>[1288](#fn_1287.md) except only in the opinion of
Simon.  I do not accept of any other god but Him alone who created me.”

method of interpretation is in curious harmony with the prevalent theory
of this work respecting the mixture of error and truth in the
Scriptures.—R.\]

<span id="vi.iv.xix.x-p6"></span> Probably <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.xix.x-p6.1"></span>τολμήματι</span> should be changed into
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.iv.xix.x-p6.2"></span>ὁρμήματι</span>,
or some such word:  making known that an act of injustice has been
committed by taking its departure.

<span id="fn_1286"></span>[315:1287](0081062.htm#fr_1286.md) <span
id="vi.iv.xix.x-p6.3"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.xix.x-p7"></span> This might possibly be translated,
“let him leave him who exists to him who exists;” i.e., let him leave
the real God to man, who really exists.

<span id="fn_1287"></span>[315:1288](0081062.htm#fr_1287.md) <span
id="vi.iv.xix.x-p7.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.xix.x-p8"></span> Wieseler proposes, “for he exists to
no one.”
