<span id="vi.iv.xix.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.xix.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIII.—The Contradictions of the
Scriptures Intended to Try Those Who Read Them.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xix.xiii-p2"></span>And Peter answered: <span
id="fr_1291"></span>[1292](#fn_1291.md)   “If the Scriptures or prophets
speak of gods, they do so to try those who hear.  For thus it is
written: <span id="fr_1292"></span>[1293](#fn_1292.md)   ‘If there arise
among you a prophet, giving signs and wonders, and that sign and wonder
shall then come to pass, and he say to thee, Let us go after and worship
other gods which thy fathers have not known, ye <span
id="fr_1293"></span>[1294](#fn_1293.md) shall not hearken to the words of
that prophet; let thy hands be among the first to stone him.  For he
hath tried to turn thee from the Lord thy God.  But if thou say in thy
heart, How did he do that sign or wonder? thou shalt surely know that he
who tried thee, tried thee to see if thou dost fear the Lord thy God.’ 
The words ‘he who tried thee, tried thee,’ have reference to the
earliest times; <span id="fr_1294"></span>[1295](#fn_1294.md) but it
appears to be otherwise after the removal to Babylon.  For God, who
knows all things, would not, as can be proved by many arguments, try in
order that He Himself might know, for He fore-knows all things.  But, if
you like, let us discuss this point, and I shall show that God
foreknows.  But it has been proved that the opinion is false that He
does not know, and that this was written to try us.  Thus we, Simon, can
be led astray <span id="fr_1295"></span>[1296](#fn_1295.md) neither by the
Scriptures nor by any one else; nor are we deceived into the admission
of many gods, nor do we agree to any statement that is made against God.

<span id="vi.iv.xix.xiii-p6"></span> Lit., “But it had been said that he
who tried, tried.”  The idea seems to be, Before the removal to Babylon
true prophets tested the people by urging them to worship these gods;
but after that event false prophets arose who really wished to seduce
the Jews from the worship of the true God.
