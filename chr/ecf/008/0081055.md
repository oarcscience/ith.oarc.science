<span id="vi.iv.xix.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.xix.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter III.—The Mode of the
Discussion.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xix.iii-p2"></span>And our father said:  “Well might you
have demanded testimony from me, Simon, if Peter had first denied *that
he had made the promise*.  But now I shall feel no shame in saying what
I am bound to say.  I think that you wish to enter on the discussion
inflamed with anger.  Now this is a state of mind in which it is
improper for you to speak and for us to listen to you; for we are no
longer being helped on to the truth. but we are watching the progress of
a contest.  And now, having learned from Hellenic culture how those who
seek *the truth* ought to act, I shall remind you.  Let each of you give
an exposition of his own opinion, <span
id="fr_1250"></span>[1251](#fn_1250) and let the right of speech pass
from the one to the other. <span id="fr_1251"></span>[1252](#fn_1251)  
For if Peter alone should wish to expound his thought, but you should be
silent as to yours, it is possible that some argument adduced by you
might crush both your and his opinion; and both of you, though defeated
by this argument, would not appear defeated, but only the one who
expounded his opinion; while he who did not expound his, though equally
defeated, would not appear defeated, but would even be thought to have
conquered.”  And Simon answered:  “I will do as you say; but I am afraid
lest you do not turn out a truth-loving judge, as you have been already
prejudiced by his arguments.”
