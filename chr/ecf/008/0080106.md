id="vi.iii.iii.xliv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLIV.—Challenge by
Caiaphas.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iii.xliv-p2"></span>“But when we twelve apostles, on
the day of the passover, had come together with an immense multitude,
and entered into the church of the brethren, each one of us, at the
request of James, <span id="fr_574"></span>[575](#fn_574.md) stated
briefly, in the hearing of the people, what we had done in every
place. <span id="fr_575"></span>[576](#fn_575.md)   While this was going
on, Caiaphas, the high priest, sent priests to us, and asked us to come
to him, that either we should prove to him that Jesus is the eternal
Christ, or he to us that He is not, and that so all the people should
agree upon the one faith or the other; and this he frequently entreated
us to do.  But we often put it off, always seeking for a more convenient
time.”  Then I, Clement, answered to this:  “I think that this very
question, whether He is the Christ, is of great importance for the
establishment of the faith; otherwise the high priest would not so
frequently ask that he might either learn or teach concerning the
Christ.”  Then Peter:  “You have answered rightly, O Clement; for as no
one can see without eyes, nor hear without ears, nor smell without
nostrils, nor taste without a tongue, nor handle anything without hands,
so it is impossible, without the true Prophet, to know what is pleasing
to God.”  And I answered:  “I have already learned from your instruction
that this true prophet is *the Christ*; but I should wish to learn what
*the Christ* means, or why He is so called, that a matter of so great
importance may not be vague and uncertain to me.”

stoning of Stephen, to which there is no allusion.  The whole bears
abundant marks of “manipulation” of the New-Testament record.—R.\]
