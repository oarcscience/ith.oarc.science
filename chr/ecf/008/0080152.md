id="vi.iii.iv.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XV.—Simon Magus, Professed to Have
Made a Boy of Air.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iv.xv-p2"></span>“As we spoke these and such like words
with looks suited to the occasion, this most vain fellow believed that
we were deceived; and being thereby the more elated, he added also
this:  ‘I shall now be propitious to you, for the affection which you
bear towards me as God; for you loved me while you did not know me, and
were seeking me in ignorance.  But I would not have you doubt that this
is truly to be God, when one is able to become small or great as he
pleases; for I am able to appear to man in whatever manner I please. 
Now, then, I shall begin to unfold to you what is true.  Once on a time,
I, by my power, turning air into water, and water again into blood, and
solidifying it into flesh, formed a new human creature—a boy—and
produced a much nobler work than God the Creator.  For He created a man
from the earth, but I from air—a far more difficult matter; and again I
unmade him and restored him to air, but not until I had placed his
picture and image in my bed-chamber, as a proof and memorial of my
work.’  Then we understood that he spake concerning that boy, whose
soul, after he had been slain by violence, he made use of for those
services which he required.”
