<span id="vii.v.xii-p2"></span>And when he was thinking of rising up and
hiding himself, and dwelling in secret, behold, on that very night, the
angel of the Lord appeared to him in sleep, saying:  Joseph, thou son of
David, fear not; receive Mary as thy wife:  for that which is in her
womb is of the Holy Spirit.  And she shall bring forth a son, and His
name shall be called Jesus, for He will save His people from their
sins.  And Joseph, rising from his sleep, gave thanks to God, and spoke
to Mary and the virgins who were with her, and told them his vision. 
And he was comforted about Mary, saying:  I have sinned, in that I
suspected thee at all.
