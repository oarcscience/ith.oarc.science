id="vi.iv.iii.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter X.—“Whatsoever Things are
Honest.”</span>

<span id="vi.iv.iii.x-p2"></span>“Let the brethren who have causes to be
settled not be judged by the secular authorities; but let them by all
means be reconciled by the elders of the church, yielding ready
obedience to them.  Moreover, also, flee avarice, inasmuch as it is
able, under pretext of temporal gain, to deprive you of eternal
blessings.  Carefully keep your balances, your measures, your weights,
and the things belonging to your traffic, just.  Be faithful with
respect to your trusts.  Moreover, you will persevere in doing these
things, and things similar to these, until the end, if you have in your
hearts an ineradicable remembrance of the judgment that is from God. 
For who would sin, being persuaded that at the end of life there is a
judgment appointed of the righteous God, who only now is long-suffering
and good, <span id="fr_896"></span>[897](#fn_896.md) that the good may in
future enjoy for ever unspeakable blessings; but the sinners being found
as evil, shall obtain an eternity of unspeakable punishment.  And,
indeed, that these things are so, it would be reasonable to doubt, were
it not that the Prophet of the truth has said and sworn that it shall
be.

<span id="vi.iv.iii.x-p3"></span> The common reading would give “who
alone is now long-suffering;” but the change of a letter gives the
reading which we have adopted.
