id="vi.iv.xxii.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI.—The Application of the
Attributes of Man to God.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxii.xi-p2"></span>And Simon, hearing this, said:  “You
will not force me through shame to remain silent in regard to His
substance, and to inquire into His will alone.  For it is possible both
to think and to speak of His substance.  I mean from the good attributes
that belong to man.  For instance, life and death are attributes of man;
but death is not an attribute of God, but life, and eternal life. 
Furthermore, men may be both evil and good; but God can be only
incomparably good.  And, not to prolong the subject too much, the better
attributes of man are eternal attributes of God.”  And Peter said: 
“Tell me, Simon, is it an attribute of man to beget evil and good, and
to do evil and good?”  And Simon said:  “It is.”  And Peter said: 
“Since you made this assertion, we must assign the better attributes of
man to God; and so, while men beget evil and good, God can beget good
only; and while men do evil and good, God rejoices only in doing good. 
Thus, with regard <span id="page_334">p. 334</span> <span
id="vi.iv.xxii.xi-Page_334"></span>*to God*, we must either not
predicate any of the attributes of man and be silent, or it is
reasonable that we should assign the best of the good attributes to
Him.  And thus He alone is the cause of all good things.”
