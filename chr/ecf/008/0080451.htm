<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.x.xlv-p2"></A>Says Aquila:&#160; &#8220;I shall do so without delay.&#160; Two visible signs are shown in heaven&#8212;one of the sun, the other of the moon; and these are followed by five other stars, each describing its own separate orbit.&#160; These, therefore, God has placed in the heaven, by which the temperature of the air may be regulated according to the seasons, and the order of vicissitudes and alternations may be kept.&#160; But by means of the very same <i>signs</i>, if at any time plague and corruption is sent upon the earth for the sins of men, the air is disturbed, pestilence is brought upon animals, blight upon crops, and a destructive year in every way upon men; and thus it is that by one and the same means order is both kept and destroyed.&#160; For it is manifest even to the unbelieving and unskilful, that the course of the sun, which is useful and necessary to the world, and which is assigned by providence, is always kept orderly; but the courses of the moon, in comparison of the course of the sun, seem to the unskilful to be inordinate and unsettled in her waxings and wanings.&#160; For the sun moves in fixed and orderly periods: for from him are hours, from him the day when he rises, from him also the night when he sets; from him months and years are reckoned, from him the variations of seasons are produced; while, rising to the higher regions, he tempers the spring; but when he reaches the top of the heaven, he kindles the summer&#146;s heats:&#160; again, sinking, he produces the temper of autumn; and when he returns to his lowest circle, he bequeaths to us the rigour of winter&#146;s cold from the icy binding of heaven.</p>
