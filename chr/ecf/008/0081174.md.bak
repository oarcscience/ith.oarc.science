<span id="vii.iii.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vii.iii.ii-p1.1"></span>Part II.—The Apocryphal Acts of the
Apostles.</span>

<span id="vii.iii.ii-p2"></span>This portion of the volume, extending
from page 477 to page 564, presents us with documents written in a style
considerably different from that of the Apocryphal Gospels properly so
called.  There we have without stint the signs that the Jews desired;
here we begin to have some glimpses of the wisdom which the Greeks
sought after, along with a considerable share of

<span id="vii.iii.ii-p3"></span>Quidquid Græcia mendax

<span id="vii.iii.ii-p4"></span>Audet in historia.

<span id="vii.iii.ii-p5"></span>We have less of miracle, more of
elaborate discourse.  The Apocryphal Gospels were suited to the *vilis
plebecula*, from which, as Jerome said, the Church originated; the
Apocryphal Acts appeal more to the *Academia.*

<span id="vii.iii.ii-p6"></span>We have in ancient literature,
especially Greek literature, a long series of fabulous histories
attached to the names of men who made themselves famous either in arts
or arms.  This taste for the marvellous became general after the
expedition of Alexander; and from that time down we have numerous
examples of it in the lives of Alexander, of Pythagoras, of Apollonius
of Tyana, of Homer, of Virgil, and others without number; and we all
know how much fabulous matter is apt to gather round the names of
popular heroes even in modern times.

<span id="vii.iii.ii-p7"></span><span id="page_355">p. 355</span> <span
id="vii.iii.ii-Page_355"></span>It is not to be wondered at, then, that
round the names of Christ and His apostles, who had brought about social
changes greater than those effected by the exploits of any hero of old,
there should gather, as the result of the wondering awe of simple-minded
men, a growth of the romantic and the fabulous.

<span id="vii.iii.ii-p8"></span>These stories came at length to form a
sort of apostolic cycle, of which the documents following are portions. 
They exist also in a Latin form in the ten books of the Acts of the
Apostles, compiled probably in the sixth century, and falsely attributed
to Abdias, the first bishop of Babylon, by whom it was, of course,
written in Hebrew. <span id="fr_1552"></span>[1553](#fn_1552.md)

<span id="vii.iii.ii-p10"></span>We shall now give a brief account of
each of the thirteen documents which make up this part of the volume.

<span id="vii.iii.ii-p11"></span>I.  *The Acts of Peter and Paul*.—This
book was first published in a complete form by Thilo in 1837 and 1838. 
A portion of it had already been translated into Latin by the famous
Greek scholar Constantine Lascaris in 1490, and had been made use of in
the celebrated controversy as to the situation of the island Melita,
upon which St. Paul was shipwrecked.  For his edition Tischendorf
collated six <span class="c9"><span
id="vii.iii.ii-p11.1"></span>mss.</span>, the oldest of the end of the
ninth century.

<span id="vii.iii.ii-p12"></span>Some portions at least of the book are
of an early date.  The *Domine quo vadis* story, p. 485, is referred to
by Origen, and others after him.  A book called the Acts of Peter is
condemned in the decree of Pope Gelasius.

<span id="vii.iii.ii-p13"></span>II.  *Acts of Paul and Thecla*.—This
book is of undoubted antiquity.  There seems reason to accept the
account of it given by Tertullian, that it was written by an Asiatic
presbyter in glorification of St. Paul (who, however, unquestionably
occupies only a secondary place in it), and in support of the heretical
opinion that women may teach and baptize.  It is expressly mentioned and
quoted by a long line of Latin and Greek Fathers.  The quotations are
inserted in Tischendorf’s *Prolegomena*, p. xxiv.

<span id="vii.iii.ii-p14"></span>The text was first edited in 1698 by
Grabe from a Bodleian <span class="c9"><span
id="vii.iii.ii-p14.1"></span>ms.</span>, republished by Jones in 1726. 
A blank in the Bodleian <span class="c9"><span
id="vii.iii.ii-p14.2"></span>ms.</span> was supplied in 1715 by Thomas
Hearne from another Oxford <span class="c9"><span
id="vii.iii.ii-p14.3"></span>ms. </span> Tischendorf’s text is from a
recension of three Paris <span class="c9"><span
id="vii.iii.ii-p14.4"></span>mss.</span>, each of the eleventh century.

<span id="vii.iii.ii-p15"></span>III.  *Acts of Barnabas*.—This book has
more an air of truth about it than any of the others.  There is not much
extravagance in the details, and the geography is correct, showing that
the writer knew Cyprus well.  It seems to have been written at all
events before 478, in which year the body of Barnabas is said to have
been found in Cyprus.

<span id="vii.iii.ii-p16"></span>Papebroche first edited the book in the
*Acta Sanctorum*  in 1698, with a Latin translation.  The Vatican <span
class="c9"><span id="vii.iii.ii-p16.1"></span>ms.</span> which he used
was an imperfect one.  Tischendorf’s text is from a Parisian <span
class="c9"><span id="vii.iii.ii-p16.2"></span>ms.</span> of the end of
the ninth century.

<span id="vii.iii.ii-p17"></span>IV.  *Acts of Philip*.—A book under
this name was condemned in the decree of Pope Gelasius; and that the
traditions about Philip were well known from an early date, is evident
from the abundant references to them in ancient documents.  The writings
of the Hagiographers also, both Greek and Latin, contain epitomes of
Philip’s life.

<span id="vii.iii.ii-p18"></span>The Greek text, now first published, is
a recension of two <span class="c9"><span
id="vii.iii.ii-p18.1"></span>mss.</span>,—a Parisian one of the eleventh
century, and a Venetian one.  The latter is noticeable, from being
superscribed *From the Fifteenth Act to the end*, leaving us to infer
that we have only a portion of the book.

<span id="vii.iii.ii-p19"></span>V.  *Acts of Philip in Hellas*.—This
also is published for the first time by Tischendorf.  It is obviously a
later document than the preceding, though composed in the same style. 
It is from a Parisian <span class="c9"><span
id="vii.iii.ii-p19.1"></span>ms.</span> of the eleventh century.

<span id="vii.iii.ii-p20"></span><span id="page_356">p. 356</span> <span
id="vii.iii.ii-Page_356"></span>VI.  *Acts of Andrew*.—In the decree of
Pope Gelasius (*d*. 496), a book under this name is condemned as
apocryphal.  Epiphanius (*d*. 403) states that the Acts of Andrew were
in favour with the Encratites, the Apostolics, and the Origenians;
Augustine (*d*. 430) mentions that the Acts of the Apostles written by
Leucius Charinus—*discipulus diaboli*, as Pope Gelasius calls him—were
held in estimation by the Manichæans.  The authorship generally is
attributed to Leucius by early writers; Innocentius I. (*d*. 417),
however, says that the Acts of Andrew were composed by the philosophers
Nexocharis and Leonidas.  This book is much the same in substance with
the celebrated *Presbyterorum et Diaconorum Achaiæ de martyrio S. Andreæ
apostoli epistola encyclica*, first edited in Greek by Woog in 1749, and
by him considered to be a genuine writing of the apostolic age, composed
about <span class="c9"><span id="vii.iii.ii-p20.1"></span>a.d.</span>
80.  Thilo, while dissenting from this opinion of Woog’s, concludes that
it is a fragment from the Acts of Leucius, expurgated of most of its
heresy, and put into its present shape by an orthodox writer.  Cardinals
Baronius and Bellarmine assign the epistle to the apostolic age;
Fabricius thinks it much later.

<span id="vii.iii.ii-p21"></span>The probability is that the book was
written by Leucius, following earlier traditions, and that it was
afterwards revised and fitted for general reading by an orthodox hand.

<span id="vii.iii.ii-p22"></span>Though some of the traditions mentioned
in the book are referred to by authors of the beginning of the fifth
century, there does not seem to be any undoubted quotation of it before
the eighth and the tenth centuries.  Some portions of Pseudo-Abdias,
however, are almost in the words of our Greek Acts.

<span id="vii.iii.ii-p23"></span>The text is edited chiefly from two
<span class="c9"><span id="vii.iii.ii-p23.1"></span>mss.</span>,—the one
of the eleventh, the other of the fourteenth century.

<span id="vii.iii.ii-p24"></span>The Greek of the original is good of
the kind, and exhibits considerable rhetorical skill.

<span id="vii.iii.ii-p25"></span>VII.  *Acts of Andrew and
Matthias*.—Thilo assigns the authorship of these Acts also to Leucius,
and the use of them to the Gnostics, Manichæans, and other heretics. 
Pseudo-Abdias seems to have derived his account of Andrew and Matthias
from the same source.  Epiphanius the monk, who wrote in the tenth
century, gives extracts from the history.  There is, besides, an old
English—commonly called Anglo-Saxon—poem, Andrew and Helene, published
by Jacob Grimm in 1840, the argument of which in great part coincides
with that of the Acts of Andrew and Matthias.

<span id="vii.iii.ii-p26"></span>There is considerable doubt as to
whether it is Matthias or Matthew that is spoken of.  Pseudo-Abdias,
followed by all the Latin writers on the subject, calls him Matthew. 
The Greek texts hesitate between the two.  Tischendorf edits Matthias,
on the authority of his oldest <span class="c9"><span
id="vii.iii.ii-p26.1"></span>ms. </span> There is also some discrepancy
as to the name of the town.  Some <span class="c9"><span
id="vii.iii.ii-p26.2"></span>mss.</span> say Sinope, others Myrmene or
Myrna:  they generally, however, coincide in calling it a town of
Æthiopia.

<span id="vii.iii.ii-p27"></span>Thilo, and Tischendorf after him, made
use chiefly of three <span class="c9"><span
id="vii.iii.ii-p27.1"></span>mss.</span>, only one of which, of the
fifteenth century, contains the whole book.  The oldest is an uncial
<span class="c9"><span id="vii.iii.ii-p27.2"></span>ms.</span> of about
the eighth century.

<span id="vii.iii.ii-p28"></span>The Acts of Peter and Andrew, from the
Bodleian <span class="c9"><span id="vii.iii.ii-p28.1"></span>ms.</span>,
are inserted as an appendix to the Acts of Andrew and Matthias.

<span id="vii.iii.ii-p29"></span>VIII.  *Acts of Matthew*.—This book is
edited by Tischendorf for the first time.  It is a much later production
than the last, written in bad Greek, and in a style rendered very
cumbrous by the use of participial phrases.

<span id="vii.iii.ii-p30"></span>On the authority of the oldest <span
class="c9"><span id="vii.iii.ii-p30.1"></span>ms.</span>, Matthew, not
Matthias, is the name here.  It is probably owing to this confusion
between the names, that there is much uncertainty in the traditions
regarding St. Matthew.

<span id="vii.iii.ii-p31"></span>Tischendorf gives, in his
*Prolegomena*, a long extract from Nicephorus, which shows that he was
acquainted with this book, or something very like it.

<span id="vii.iii.ii-p32"></span>The text is edited from two <span
class="c9"><span id="vii.iii.ii-p32.1"></span>mss.</span>,—a Parisian of
the eleventh century, and a Viennese of a later date.

<span id="vii.iii.ii-p33"></span><span id="page_357">p. 357</span> <span
id="vii.iii.ii-Page_357"></span>IX.  *Acts of Thomas*.—The substance of
this book is of great antiquity, and in its original form it was held in
great estimation by the heretics of the first and second centuries.  The
main heresy which it contained was that the Apostle Thomas baptized, not
with water, but with oil only.  It is mentioned by Epiphanius,
Turribius, and Nicephorus, condemned in the decree of Gelasius, and in
the Synopsis of Scripture ascribed to Athanasius, in which it is placed,
along with the Acts of Peter, Acts of John, and other books, among the
*Antilegomena*.  St. Augustine in three passages refers to the book in
such a way as to show that he had it in something very like its present
form.  Two centuries later, Pseudo-Abdias made a recension of the book,
rejecting the more heretical portions, and adapting it generally to
orthodox use.  Photius attributes the authorship of this document, as of
many other apocryphal Acts, to Leucius Charinus.

<span id="vii.iii.ii-p34"></span>The Greek text was first edited, with
copious notes and prolegomena, by Thilo in 1823.  The text from which
the present translation is made is a recension of five <span
class="c9"><span id="vii.iii.ii-p34.1"></span>mss.</span>, the oldest of
the tenth century.

<span id="vii.iii.ii-p35"></span>X.  *Consummation of Thomas*.—This is
properly a portion of the preceding book.  Pseudo-Abdias follows it very
closely, but the Greek of some chapters of his translation or
compilation has not yet been discovered.

<span id="vii.iii.ii-p36"></span>The text, edited by Tischendorf for the
first time, is from a <span class="c9"><span
id="vii.iii.ii-p36.1"></span>ms.</span> of the eleventh century.

<span id="vii.iii.ii-p37"></span>XI.  *Martyrdom of Bartholomew*.—This
Greek text, now for the first time edited by Tischendorf, is very
similar to the account of Bartholomew in Pseudo-Abdias.  The editor is
inclined to believe, not that the Greek text is a translation of Abdias,
which it probably is, but that both it and Abdias are derived from the
same source.  Tischendorf seems inclined to lay some weight upon the
mention made by Abdias of a certain Crato, said to be a disciple of the
Apostles Simon and Judas, having written a voluminous history of the
apostles, which was translated into Latin by Julius Africanus.  The
whole story, however, is absurd.  It is very improbable that Julius
Africanus knew any Latin; it is possible, however, that he may have
compiled some stories of the apostles, that these may have been
translated into Latin, and that Pseudo-Crato and Pseudo-Abdias may have
derived some of their materials from this source.

<span id="vii.iii.ii-p38"></span>The Greek text is edited from a
Venetian <span class="c9"><span id="vii.iii.ii-p38.1"></span>ms.</span>
of the thirteenth century.

<span id="vii.iii.ii-p39"></span>XII.  *Acts of Thaddæus*.—This
document, of which our text is the *editio princeps*, is of some
consequence, as giving in another form the famous letters of Christ to
Abgarus.  Eusebius (*H. E*., i. 13) says that he found in the archives
of Edessa the letters written by their own hands, and that he translated
them from the Syriac.  The story of the portrait was a later invention. 
It is found in Pseudo-Abdias (x. 1), and with great detail in Nicephorus
(*H. E*., ii. 7).  There is considerable variety in the texts of the
letters.  They were probably written in Syriac in the third century by
some native of Edessa, who wished to add to the importance of his city
and the antiquity of his church.  See the whole subject discussed in Dr.
Cureton’s *Ancient Syriac Documents relative to the earliest
establishment of Christianity in Edessa.*

<span id="vii.iii.ii-p40"></span>The Greek text, which is probably of
the sixth or seventh century, seems, from allusions to the synagogue,
the hours of prayer, the Sabbath-day, etc., to have been written by a
Jew.  It is edited from a Paris <span class="c9"><span
id="vii.iii.ii-p40.1"></span>ms.</span> of the eleventh century, and a
Vienna one of a later date.

<span id="vii.iii.ii-p41"></span>XIII.  *Acts of John*.—A book under
this title is mentioned by Eusebius, Epiphanius, Photius, among Greek
writers; Augustine, Philastrius, Innocent I., and Turribius among Latin
writers.  The two last named and Photius ascribe the authorship to
Leucius, *discipulus diaboli*, who got the credit of all these heretical
*brochures*.  It is not named in the decree of Gelasius.

<span id="vii.iii.ii-p42"></span>Augustine (*Tractat*. 124 *in
Johannem*) relates at length the story of John going down alive into his
grave, and of the fact of his being alive being shown by his breath
stirring about the dust on the tomb.  This story, which has some
resemblance to the Teutonic legend of Barbarossa, is repeated by
Photius.

<span id="vii.iii.ii-p43"></span><span id="page_358">p. 358</span> <span
id="vii.iii.ii-Page_358"></span>There is a Latin document published by
Fabricius, *Pseudo-Melitonis liber de Passione S. Johannis Evangelistæ*,
which the author professed to write with the original of Leucius before
his eyes.  It has considerable resemblances in some passages to the
present text.  The only passages in Pseudo-Abdias that appear to have
any connection with the present document are those which refer to the
apostle’s burial.

<span id="vii.iii.ii-p44"></span>The text is edited from a Paris <span
class="c9"><span id="vii.iii.ii-p44.1"></span>ms.</span> of the eleventh
century, and a Vienna one, to which no date is assigned.

<span id="vii.iii.ii-p45"></span>It is doubtful whether the narrative
part of the Acts of John be by the same hand as the discourses.
