id="vi.iv.xxii.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXI.—The Uses of Lust, Anger,
Grief.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxii.xxi-p2"></span>And Simon said: <span
id="fr_1462"></span>[1463](#fn_1462.md)   “You were right in saying this;
but in the present world does not man seem to you to be capable of every
kind of affection,—as, for instance, of lust, anger, grief, and the
like?”  And Peter said:  “Yes, these belong to the things that are
accidental, not to those that always exist, and it will be found that
they now occur with advantage to the soul.  For lust has, by the will of
Him who created all things well, been made to arise within the living
being, that, led by it to intercourse, he may increase humanity, from a
selection of which a multitude of superior beings arise who are fit for
eternal life.  But if it were not for lust, no one would trouble himself
with intercourse with his wife; but now, for the sake of pleasure, and,
as it were, gratifying himself, man carries out His will.  Now, if a man
uses lust for lawful marriage, he does not act impiously; but if he
rushes to adultery, he acts impiously, and he is punished because he
makes a bad use of a good ordinance.  And in the same way, anger has
been made by God to be lighted up naturally within us, in order that we
may be induced by it to ward off injuries.  Yet if any one indulges it
without restraint, he acts unjustly; but if he uses it within due
bounds, he does what is right.  Moreover, we are capable of grief, that
we may be moved with sympathy at the death of relatives, of a wife, or
children, or brothers, or parents, or friends, or some others, since, if
we were not capable of sympathy, we should be inhuman.  In like manner,
all the other affections will be found to be adapted for us, if at least
the reason for their existence <span
id="fr_1463"></span>[1464](#fn_1463.md) be considered.”
