<span id="x.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c6"><span
id="x.vii-p1.1"></span>Dionysius, Bishop of Corinth.</span>

<span id="x.vii-p2"></span>\[<span class="c9"><span
id="x.vii-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> 170.\]  Eusebius is almost diffuse in
what he tells us of this Dionysius, <span
id="fr_3708"></span>[3709](#fn_3708.md) “who was appointed over the church
at Corinth, and imparted freely, not only to his own people, but to
others, and those abroad also, the blessings of his divine labours.”  He
wrote “Catholic Epistles;” he addressed an epistle to the Spartans and
the Athenians; and, as Eusebius says, Dionysius the Areopagite, the
convert of St. Paul, was the first bishop of Athens. <span
id="fr_3709"></span>[3710](#fn_3709.md)   He wrote to the Nicomedians,
refuting Marcion, and closely adhering to “the rule of faith.”  In an
epistle to the Gortynians and others in Crete, he praises Philip for his
courageous ministry, and warns them against the heretics.  He seems to
recognise Palmas as bishop of Amastris and Pontus, and adds expositions
of Scripture, and rules regarding marriage, its purity and sanctity.  He
also inculcates tenderness to penitent lapsers and backsliders.  With
Pinytus, bishop of the Gnossians, he corresponds on similar subjects;
but Pinytus, while he thanks him and commends his clemency, evidently
regards him as too much inclined to furnish “food for babes,” and
counsels him to add “strong meat for those of full age.”  He also writes
to Chrysophora, his most faithful sister, imparting spiritual
instruction.

id="x.vii-p5.1"></span>Fragments from a Letter to the Roman
Church.</span>

<span id="x.vii-p6"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="x.vii-p6.1"></span>I.</span>

<span id="x.vii-p7"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="x.vii-p7.1"></span>For</span> this has been your custom from the
beginning, to do good to all the brethren in various ways, and to send
resources to many churches which are in every city, thus refreshing the
poverty of the needy, and granting subsidies to the brethren who are in
the mines. <span id="fr_3710"></span>[3711](#fn_3710.md)   Through the
resources which ye have sent from the beginning, ye Romans, keep up the
custom of the Romans handed down by the fathers, which your blessed
Bishop Soter has not only preserved, but added to, sending a splendid
gift to the saints, and exhorting with blessed words those brethren who
go up to Rome, as an affectionate father his children.

<span id="x.vii-p9"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="x.vii-p9.1"></span>II.</span>

<span id="x.vii-p10"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="x.vii-p10.1"></span>From the Same Epistle. <span
id="fr_3711"></span>[3712](#fn_3711.md) </span>

<span id="x.vii-p12"></span>We passed this holy Lord’s day, in which we
read your letter, from the constant reading of which we shall be able to
draw admonition, even as from the reading of the former one you sent us
written through Clement.

<span id="x.vii-p13"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="x.vii-p13.1"></span>III.</span>

<span id="x.vii-p14"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="x.vii-p14.1"></span>From the Same.</span>

<span id="x.vii-p15"></span>Therefore you also have by such admonition
joined in close union *the churches* that were planted by Peter and
Paul, that of the Romans and that of the Corinthians:  for both of them
went <span id="fr_3712"></span>[3713](#fn_3712.md) to our Corinth, and
taught us in the same way as they taught you when they went to Italy;
and having taught you, they suffered martyrdom at the same time. <span
id="fr_3713"></span>[3714](#fn_3713.md)

<span id="x.vii-p18"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="x.vii-p18.1"></span>IV.</span>

<span id="x.vii-p19"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="x.vii-p19.1"></span>From the Same. <span
id="fr_3714"></span>[3715](#fn_3714.md) </span>

<span id="x.vii-p21"></span>For I wrote letters when the brethren
requested me to write.  And these letters the apostles of the devil have
filled with tares, taking away some things and adding others, for whom a
woe is in store.  It is not wonderful, then, if some have attempted to
adulterate the Lord’s writings, when they have formed designs against
those which are not such. <span id="fr_3715"></span>[3716](#fn_3715.md)
