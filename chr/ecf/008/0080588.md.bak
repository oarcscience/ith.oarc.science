id="vi.iv.ii.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V.—The Adjuration Accepted.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.ii.v-p2"></span>James having thus spoken, the elders
were in an agony of terror.  Therefore James, perceiving that they were
greatly afraid, said:  “Hear me, brethren and fellow-servants.  If we
should give the books to all indiscriminately, and they should be
corrupted by any daring men, or be perverted by interpretations, as you
have heard that some have already done, it will remain even for those
who really seek the truth, always to wander in error.  Wherefore it is
better that they should be with us, and that we should communicate them
with all the fore-mentioned care to those who wish to live piously, and
to save others.  But if any one, after taking this adjuration, shall act
otherwise, he shall with good reason incur eternal punishment.  For why
should not he who is the cause of the destruction of <span

not be destroyed himself?”  The elders, therefore, being pleased with
the sentiments of James exclaimed, “Blessed be He who, as foreseeing all
things, has graciously appointed thee as our bishop;” and when they had
said this, we all rose up, and prayed to the Father and God of all, to
whom be glory for ever.  Amen. <span id="fr_893"></span>[894](#fn_893.md)
