<span id="vi.iii.vii.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iii.vii.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI.—The Expectation of the
Gentiles.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.vii.xi-p2"></span>“But that which a prophet of the Jews
foretold, that He was to be waited for by the Gentiles, <span
id="fr_755"></span>[756](#fn_755.md) confirms above measure the faith of
truth in Him.  For if he had said that He was to be waited for by the
Jews, he would not have seemed to prophesy anything extraordinary, that
He whose coming had been promised for the salvation of the world should
be the object of hope to the people of the same tribe with Himself, and
to His own nation:  for that this would take place, would seem rather to
be a matter of natural inference than one requiring the grandeur of a
prophetic utterance.  But now, whereas the prophets say that all that
hope which is set forth concerning the salvation of the world, and the
newness of the kingdom which is to be established by Christ, and all
things which are declared concerning Him are to be transferred to the
Gentiles; the grandeur of the prophetic office is confirmed, not
according to the sequence of things, but by an incredible fulfilment of
the prophecy.  For the Jews from the beginning had understood by a most
certain tradition that this man should at some time come, by whom all
things should be restored; and daily meditating and looking out for His
coming, when they saw Him amongst them, and accomplishing the signs and
miracles, as had been written of Him, being blinded with envy, they
could not recognise Him when present, in the hope of whom they rejoiced
while He was absent; yet the few of us who were chosen by Him understood
it.
