Interpretation.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.xii.xxxii-p2"></span>“She therefore (Rhea, or nature),
it is said, produced, as it were, a certain bubble which had been
collecting for a long time; and it being <span id="page_201">p.
201</span> <span id="vi.iii.xii.xxxii-Page_201"></span>gradually
collected from the spirit which was in the waters, swelled, and being
for some time driven over the surface of matter, from which it had come
forth as from a womb, and being hardened by the rigour of cold, and
always increasing by additions of ice, at length was broken off and sunk
into the deep, and drawn by its own weight, went down to the infernal
regions; and because it became invisible it was called Aides, and is
also named Orcus or Pluto. <span id="fr_870"></span>[871](#fn_870)   And
since it was sunk from the top to the bottom, it gave place to the moist
element to flow together; and the grosser part, which is the earth, was
laid bare by the retirement of the waters.  They say, therefore, that
this freedom of the waters, which was formerly restrained by the
presence of the bubble, was called Neptune after the bubble attained the
lowest place.  After this, when the cold element had been sucked down to
the lower regions by the concretion of the icy bubble, and the dry and
the moist element had been separated, there being now no hindrance, the
warm element rushed by its force and lightness to the upper regions of
the air, being borne up by wind and storm.  This storm, therefore, which
in Greek is called <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iii.xii.xxxii-p3.1"></span>καταιγίς</span>, they called <span
class="c9"><span id="vi.iii.xii.xxxii-p3.2"></span>ægis</span>—that is,
a she-goat; and the fire which ascended to the upper regions they called
Jupiter; wherefore they say that he ascended to Olympus riding on a
she-goat.
