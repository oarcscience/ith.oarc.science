<span id="vii.v.ii-p3"></span>In those days there was a man in
Jerusalem, Joachim by name, of the tribe of Judah.  He was the shepherd
of his own sheep, fearing the Lord in integrity and singleness of
heart.  He had no other care than that of his herds, from the produce of
which he supplied with food all that feared God, offering double gifts
in the fear of God to all who laboured in doctrine, and who ministered
unto Him.  Therefore his lambs, and his sheep, and his wool, and all
things whatsoever he possessed, he used to divide into three portions: 
one he gave to the orphans, the widows, the strangers, and the poor; the
second to those that worshipped God; and the third he kept for himself
and all his house. <span id="fr_1616"></span>[1617](#fn_1616.md)   And as
he did so, the Lord multiplied to him his herds, so that there was no
man like him in the people of Israel.  This now he began to do when he
was fifteen years old.  And at the age of twenty he took to wife Anna,
the daughter of Achar, of his own tribe, that is, of the tribe of Judah,
of the family of David.  And though they had lived together for twenty
years, he had by her neither sons nor daughters. <span

own eyes I saw coming to pass in the time of the nativity of the holy
virgin Mary, or of the Lord the Saviour:  giving thanks to God, who has
given me wisdom in the accounts of His Advent, showing His abounding
grace to the twelve tribes of Israel.

temple; and because of this, they were wont to go to the temple of the
Lord at each of the yearly festivals.
