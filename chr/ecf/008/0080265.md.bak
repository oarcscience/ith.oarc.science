id="vi.iii.v.lv-p1.1"></span>Chapter LXV.—Peter Resolves to Follow
Simon.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.v.lv-p2"></span>“Be not, my brethren, distressed by
those things that have been done, but give heed to the future:  for what
is passed is ended; but the things which threaten are dangerous to those
who shall fall in with them.  For offences shall never be wanting in
this world, <span id="fr_710"></span>[711](#fn_710.md) so long as the enemy
is permitted to act according to his will; in order that the prudent and
those who understood his wiles may be conquerors in the contests which
he raises against them; but that those who neglect to learn the things
that pertain to the salvation of their souls, may be taken by him with
merited deceptions.  Since, therefore, as you have heard, Simon has gone
forth to preoccupy the ears of the Gentiles who are called to salvation,
it is necessary that I also follow upon his track, so that whatever
disputations he raises may be corrected by us.  But inasmuch as it is
right that greater anxiety should be felt concerning you who are already
received within the walls of life,—for if that which has been actually
acquired perish, a positive loss is sustained; while with respect to
that which has not yet been acquired, if it can be got, there is so much
gain; but if not, the only loss is that there is no gain;—in order,
therefore, that you may be more and more confirmed in the truth, and the
nations who are called to salvation may in no way be prevented by the
wickedness of Simon, I have thought good to ordain Zacchæus as pastor
over you, <span id="fr_711"></span>[712](#fn_711.md) and to remain with you
myself for three months; and so to go to the Gentiles, lest through our
delaying longer, and the crimes of Simon stalking in every direction,
they should become incurable.”
