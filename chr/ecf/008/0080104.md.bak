<span id="vi.iii.iii.xlii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iii.iii.xlii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLII.—Call of the
Gentiles.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iii.xlii-p2"></span>“But inasmuch as it was necessary
that the Gentiles should be called into the room of those who remained
unbelieving, <span id="fr_569"></span>[570](#fn_569.md) so that the number
might be filled up which had been shown to Abraham, <span
id="fr_570"></span>[571](#fn_570.md) the preaching of the blessed kingdom
of God is sent into all the world.  On this account worldly spirits are
disturbed, who always oppose those who are in quest of liberty, and who
make use of the engines of error to destroy God’s building; while those
who press on to the glory of safety and liberty, being rendered braver
by their resistance to these spirits, and by the toil of great struggles
against them, attain the crown of safety not without the palm of
victory.  Meantime, when He had suffered, and darkness had overwhelmed
the world from the sixth even to the ninth hour, <span
id="fr_571"></span>[572](#fn_571.md) as soon as the sun shone out again,
and things were returned to their usual course, even wicked men returned
to themselves and their former practices, their fear having abated.  For
some of them, watching the place with all care, when they could not
prevent His rising again, said that He was a magician; others pretended
that he was stolen away.” <span id="fr_572"></span>[573](#fn_572.md)
