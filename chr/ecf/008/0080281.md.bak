<span id="vi.iii.vi.v-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iii.vi.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V.—Moses and Christ.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.vi.v-p2"></span>“For so also it was given to the people
of the Hebrews from the beginning, that they should love Moses, and
believe his word; whence also it is written:  ‘The people believed God,
and Moses His servant.’ <span id="fr_723"></span>[724](#fn_723.md)   What,
therefore, was of peculiar gift from God toward the nation of the
Hebrews, we see now to be given also to those who are called from among
the Gentiles to the faith.  But the method of works is put into the
power and will of every one, and this is their own; but to have an
affection towards a teacher of truth, this is a gift of the heavenly
Father.  But salvation is in this, that you do His will of whom you have
conceived a love and affection through the gift of God; lest that saying
of His <span id="page_136">p. 136</span> <span
id="vi.iii.vi.v-Page_136"></span>be addressed to you which He spoke,
‘Why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not what I say?’ <span
id="fr_724"></span>[725](#fn_724.md)   It is therefore the peculiar gift
bestowed by God upon the Hebrews, that they believe Moses; and the
peculiar gift bestowed upon the Gentiles is that they love Jesus.  For
this also the Master intimated, when He said, ‘I will confess to Thee, O
Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because Thou hast concealed these
things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to
babes.’ <span id="fr_725"></span>[726](#fn_725.md)   By which it is
certainly declared, that the people of the Hebrews, who were instructed
out of the law, did not know Him; but the people of the Gentiles have
acknowledged Jesus, and venerate Him; on which account also they shall
be saved, not only acknowledging Him, but also doing His will.  But he
who is of the Gentiles, and who has it of God to believe Moses, ought
also to have it of his own purpose to love Jesus also.  And again, the
Hebrew, who has it of God to believe Moses, ought to have it also of his
own purpose to believe in Jesus; so that each of them, having in himself
something of the divine gift, and something of his own exertion, may be
perfect by both.  For concerning such an one our Lord spoke, as of a
rich man, ‘Who brings forth from his treasures things new and
old.’ <span id="fr_726"></span>[727](#fn_726.md)
