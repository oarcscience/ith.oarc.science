id="vi.iii.xi.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVI.—Imperfect Conviction.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.xi.xvi-p2"></span>Then said the old man:  “My son
Clement has wisely framed his argument, so that he has left us nothing
to say to these things; but all his discourse which he has delivered on
the nature of men has this bearing, that along with the fact that
freedom of will is in man, there is also some cause of evil without him,
whereby men are indeed incited by various lusts, yet are not compelled
to sin; and that for this reason, he said, because fear is much more
powerful than they, and it resists and checks the violence of desires,
so that, although natural emotions may arise, yet sin may not be
committed, those demons being put to flight who incite and inflame these
emotions.  But these things do not convince me; for I am conscious of
certain things from which I know well, that by the arrangement of the
heavenly bodies men become murderers or adulterers, and perpetrate other
evils; and in like manner honourable and modest women are compelled to
act well.
