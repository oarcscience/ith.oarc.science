id="vi.iv.xiii.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II.—Ignorance and Error.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xiii.ii-p2"></span>“There seems to me to be a great
difference between the ignorant and the erring.  For the ignorant man
seems to me to be like a man who does not wish to set out for a richly
stored city, through his not knowing the excellent things that are
there; but the erring man to be like one who has learned indeed the good
things that are in the city, but who has forsaken the highway in
proceeding towards it, and so has wandered.  Thus, therefore, it seems
to me that there is a great difference between those who worship idols
and those who are faulty in the worship of God.  For they who worship
idols are ignorant of eternal life, and therefore they do not desire it;
for what they do not know, they cannot love.  But those who have chosen
to worship one God, and who have learned of the eternal life given to
the good, if they either believe or do anything different from what is
pleasing to God, are like to those who have gone out from the city of
punishment, and are desirous to come to the well-stored city, and on the
road have strayed from the right path.”
