id="vi.iii.v.xxx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XL.—Proved by the Success of the
Wicked in This Life.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.v.xxx-p2"></span>“Listen, then,” said Peter:  “Some men
who are blasphemers against God, and who spend their whole life in
injustice and pleasure die in their own bed and obtain honourable
burial; while others who worship God, and maintain their life frugally
with all honesty and sobriety, die in deserted places for their
observance of righteousness, so that they are not even thought worthy of
burial.  Where, then, is the justice of God, if there be no immortal
soul to suffer punishment in the future for impious deeds, or enjoy
rewards for piety and rectitude?”  Then Simon said:  “It is this indeed
that makes me <span id="page_125">p. 125</span> <span
id="vi.iii.v.xxx-Page_125"></span>incredulous, because many well-doers
perish miserably, and again many evil-doers finish long lives in
happiness.” <span id="fr_693"></span>[694](#fn_693.md)
