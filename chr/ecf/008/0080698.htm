<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.vi.xi-p2"></A>&#8220;Whence it must before all things be known, that nowhere can truth be found unless from a prophet of truth.&#160; But He is a true Prophet, who always knows all things, and even the thoughts of all men, who is without sin, as being convinced respecting the judgment of God.&#160; Wherefore we ought not simply to consider respecting His foreknowledge, but whether His foreknowledge can stand, apart from other cause.&#160; For physicians predict certain things, having the pulse of the patient as matter submitted to them; and some predict by means of having fowls, and some by having sacrifices, and others by having many various matters submitted to them; yet these are not prophets.</p>
