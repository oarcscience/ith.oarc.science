<span id="viii.vii-p3"></span> ————————————

<span id="viii.vii-p4"></span><span class="c6"><span
id="viii.vii-p4.1"></span>The Epistle.</span>

<span id="viii.vii-p5"></span>On the translation of bishops and of
episcopal seats.

<span id="viii.vii-p6"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="viii.vii-p6.1"></span>To</span> the brethren, most dearly beloved,
constituted to be bishops in the provinces of Bœtica and Toletana,
Bishop Anterus sends greeting in the Lord.

<span id="viii.vii-p7"></span>I should wish, my dearest brethren, always
to receive the glad account of your sincere love and peace, so that the
signs of your welfare might be promoted in turn by the dissemination of
our letters among you, if our ancient enemy should give us quiet and
deliverance from his attacks; who was a liar from the beginning, <span
id="fr_2798"></span>[2799](#fn_2798.md) the enemy of the truth, the rival
of man—in order to deceive whom he first deceived himself,—the adversary
of modesty, the master of luxury.  He feeds on cruelties; he is punished
by abstinence; he hates fasts, and his ministers preach, to that effect,
as he declares them to be superfluous, having no hope of the future, and
echoing that sentence of the apostle, in which he says, “Let us eat and
drink, for to-morrow we shall die.” <span
id="fr_2799"></span>[2800](#fn_2799.md)   O miserable boldness!  O subtlety
of a desperate mind!  For he exhorts to hatred, and puts concord to
flight.  And because the mind of man is easily drawn over to the worse
part, and chooses rather to walk by the broad way than laboriously to
take its course by the narrow way, for this reason, brethren most dearly
beloved, follow ye the better, and always leave the worse behind you. 
Do good, avoid evil, in order that ye may be found to be the disciples
of the Lord in truth.

<span id="viii.vii-p10"></span>Now, of the transference of bishops, on
which subject it has been your wish to consult the holy seat of the
apostles, know ye that that may lawfully be done for the sake of the
common good, or when it is absolutely necessary, but not at the mere
will or bidding of any individual.  Peter, our holy master, and the
prince of the apostles, was translated for the sake of the common good
from Antioch to Rome, in order that he might be in a position there of
doing more service.  Eusebius also was transferred from a certain minor
city to Alexandria by apostolic authority.  In like manner Felix, on
account of the doctrine and the good life which he maintained, was
translated by the common consent of the bishops and the other priests,
and the people from the city in which, on the election of the citizens,
he had been ordained, to Ephesus.  For that man is not chargeable with
shifting from city to city who does not do that of his own inclination
or by the force of ambition, but who is transferred for the general
good, or in virtue of some necessity, by the counsel and with the
consent of the chief parties.  Nor can he be said to transfer himself
from a smaller city to a larger, who is placed in that position not by
his own self-seeking or his own choice, but either as being driven out
of his own proper seat by force, or as being compelled by some
necessity, and who without pride and in humility has been translated and
installed there by others for the good of the place or the people:  for
man looketh on the countenance, but the Lord seeth the heart.  And the
Lord, speaking by the prophet, says, “The Lord knows the thoughts of
men, that they are vanity.” <span id="fr_2800"></span>[2801](#fn_2800.md)  
That man, therefore, does not change his seat who does not change his
mind.  Nor does he change his city who is changed not of his own will,
but by the decision and election of others.  And accordingly he does not
shift from city to city who does not leave his own city for the sake of
gain to himself, or of his own choice, but who, as has already been
said, has been translated to another city either in consequence of being
driven out of his own seat, or compelled by some necessity, or in virtue
of the election and injunction of the priests and people.  For as the
bishops have power regularly to ordain bishops and other orders of
priests, so, as often as any matter of advantage or necessity constrains
them, they have power in the above-mentioned manner <span
id="page_627">p. 627</span> <span id="viii.vii-Page_627"></span>both to
transfer and to install.  As ye have asked our opinion in these matters,
though they are not subjects unknown to you, we give you these things in
charge to hold them, lest, through the ignorance of some, that which is
better and more profitable be avoided, and what is more profitless be
taken up, even as we read in the holy Gospel:  “Woe unto you,
hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint, and anise, and cummin, and have
omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: 
these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.  Ye
blind guides, which strain out a gnat and swallow a camel.” <span
id="fr_2801"></span>[2802](#fn_2801.md)   What is lawful is *with them* not
lawful, and what is not lawful is lawful.  Even as Jannes and
Mambres <span id="fr_2802"></span>[2803](#fn_2802.md) resisted the truth,
so do they, being reprobate in mind, and lovers of pleasure rather than
of God, teach that that is unlawful which is lawful, to wit, that
bishops should shift from city to city in the manner already noted; and
what is unlawful they teach as lawful, to wit, to omit to show mercy to
those who endure straits:  that is to say, they deny that a bishop
belonging to another city should be bestowed for good, or for
necessity’s sake, upon those who have no bishop, and who want the sacred
episcopal ministry; and that another episcopal seat should be assigned
to bishops who endure persecution or straits.  They contradict the
sacred Scripture also, which testifies that God desireth mercy rather
than judgment. <span id="fr_2803"></span>[2804](#fn_2803.md)

<span id="viii.vii-p15"></span>What greater charity, I pray you, can
there be, or what more profitable service of piety, on the part of any
one to another, than to deliver him from the darkness of ignorance and
the thick darkness of inexperience, and restore him, in fine, by the
nutriment of the doctrine of the true faith, not for gain indeed, or
ambition, but for instruction and edification?  \[For he becomes, so to
speak, the hand for the maimed, the foot for the lame, the eye for the
blind, <span id="fr_2804"></span>[2805](#fn_2804.md) who unlocks the
treasure of wisdom and knowledge to one wrapped in the darkness of
ignorance, and opens up to such an one the brightness of the light and
the ways of the Lord.\] <span id="fr_2805"></span>[2806](#fn_2805.md)

<span id="viii.vii-p18"></span>Now for both parties—namely, for those
who endure a famine of the word of God, and for bishops who endure
straits, when they are installed in other cities for the common good—no
small degree of mercy is shown.  And they who deny this, although they
have the form of godliness, do yet deny the power thereof. <span
id="fr_2806"></span>[2807](#fn_2806.md)   For in such a matter I make no
recognition of race (*prosapiam*).  If, however, any one of the wise,
whom the stress of this storm (or season) has allied with other leaders
among the unwise, is stained with a participation in their deeds, yet
the excellence of the wise man, although he may chance to be privy to
their offences, makes him incapable of giving himself as a leader to
sinners.  The cause of public good and necessity is one thing, and the
cause of self-seeking, and presumption, or private inclination, is
another thing.  On account of self-seeking, or presumption, or private
inclination, bishops are not to be transferred from one city to another,
but only on account of public good and necessity.  And this is a matter
which no one denies, except those of whom it is said, “They have erred
through wine; they have not known the seer; they have been ignorant of
judgment.” <span id="fr_2807"></span>[2808](#fn_2807.md)   For if I were
constrained to open up in narration things that have been brought to
end, I would show you that no comfort comes from the comparison of such
deeds.  But, most dearly beloved, “stand ye in the ways, and see, and
ask for the old paths of the Lord, and see what is the good way and the
right, and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for your souls.” <span
id="fr_2808"></span>[2809](#fn_2808.md)   And, to speak according to the
word of Wisdom:  “Love righteousness, ye that be judges of the earth. 
Think of the Lord in goodness, and in simplicity of heart seek Him.  For
He is found of them that tempt Him not, and showeth Himself unto such as
do not distrust Him.  For froward thoughts separate from God; and His
power, when it is tried, reproveth the unwise.  For into a malicious
soul wisdom shall not enter, nor dwell in the body that is subject unto
sin.  For the holy spirit of discipline will flee deceit, and remove
from thoughts that are without understanding, and will not abide when
unrighteousness cometh in.  For wisdom is a benign spirit, and will not
acquit a blasphemer of His words.  For God is witness of his reins, and
a true beholder of his heart, and a hearer of his tongue.  For the
Spirit of the Lord hath filled the world, and that which containeth all
things hath knowledge of the voice.  Therefore he that speaketh
unrighteous things cannot be hid; neither shall vengeance, when it
punisheth, pass by him.  For inquisition shall be made into the counsels
of the ungodly.  And the sound of his words shall come unto the Lord,
and unto the manifestation of his wicked deeds; for the ear of jealousy
heareth all things, and the noise of murmurings shall not be hid. 
Therefore beware of murmuring, which is unprofitable; and refrain your
tongue from backbiting, for there is no word so secret that it shall go
for nought.  The mouth that belieth slayeth the soul.  Seek not death in
the error of your life, and pull not upon your<span id="page_628">p.
628</span> <span id="viii.vii-Page_628"></span>self destruction with the
works of your hands; for God made not death, neither hath He pleasure in
the destruction of the living.  For He created all things that they
might have their being, and He wished the nations of the world to be
healthful.  There is no poison of destruction in them, nor the kingdom
of death upon the earth of the living.  Righteousness is perpetual and
immortal, but unrighteousness is the acquisition of death.  And ungodly
men with their hands and words called it to them; and when they thought
to have it their friend, they consumed to nought, and made a covenant
with it; because they are worthy of death who take part with it.” <span
id="fr_2809"></span>[2810](#fn_2809.md)   “For they said, reasoning with
themselves, but not aright, The time of our life is short and tedious;
and in the death of a man there is no remedy, neither was there any man
known to have returned from the grave.  For we are born of nothing, and
we shall be hereafter as though we had never been.  For the breath in
our nostrils is as smoke, and speech is a little spark for the moving of
our heart; which being extinguished, our body shall be turned into
ashes, and our spirit shall vanish as the soft air.  And our life shall
pass as the trace of a cloud, and shall be dispersed as a mist that is
driven away with the beams of the sun, and overcome with the heat
thereof.  And our name shall be forgotten in time, and no man shall have
our works in remembrance.  For our time is a very shadow that passeth
away, and after our end there is no returning; for it is fast sealed,
and no man shall come again.” <span id="fr_2810"></span>[2811](#fn_2810.md)
  And for this reason every one must see to it that he keep himself with
all care, and watch himself for his own good, so that when his last day
and the end of his life come upon him, he may not pass over to
everlasting death, but to eternal life.  For the deeds of those put
under us are judged by us, but our own doth God judge.  Sometimes,
moreover, bishops are perverted through the fault of the people, to the
end that those fall more precipitately who follow them.  When the head
languisheth, the other members of the body are affected thereby.  And
viler are those who corrupt the life and morals of the good, than those
who spoil the property and goods of others.  Let each one take care that
he have neither an itching tongue nor itching ears; that is to say, that
he neither be a detractor of others himself, nor listen to others in
their detractions.  “Thou sattest,” saith he, “and spakest against thy
brother; and thou didst slander thine own mother’s son.” <span
id="fr_2811"></span>[2812](#fn_2811.md)   Let every individual abstain from
a detracting tongue, and keep a guard upon his own words, and understand
that all that they say of others shall enter into the judgment wherewith
they themselves shall be judged.  No one readily refers to an unwilling
auditor.  Let it be the care of all of you, most dearly beloved, to keep
not only your eyes, but also your tongue, pure.  And let not another
house ever know by your means what is done in any man’s house.  Let all
have the simplicity of the dove, that they devise not guile against any
one; and the subtlety of the serpent, that they be not ever thrown by
the crafty designs of others.  It does not belong to my humble station
and measure to judge others, and to say anything unfavourable of the
ministers of the churches.  Far be it from me that I should say anything
unfavourable of those who are the successors to the apostolic status,
and make the body of Christ with their sacred mouth; by whose
instrumentality we too are Christians, and who have the keys of the
kingdom of heaven, and exercise judgment before the day of judgment. 
Moreover, it is contained in the ancient law, that whoever has not given
obedience to the priests should either be stoned outside the camp by the
people, or with his neck beneath the sword should expiate his
presumption by his blood. <span id="fr_2812"></span>[2813](#fn_2812.md)

<span id="viii.vii-p26"></span>Now, however, the disobedient is cut off
by spiritual chastisement; and being cast out of the church, is torn by
the rabid mouth of demons. <span id="fr_2813"></span>[2814](#fn_2813.md)  
For it becomes those who have God in their heritage, to serve God free
from all the hindrances of the world, so that they may be able to say,
“The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance.” <span
id="fr_2814"></span>[2815](#fn_2814.md)   “O how good and pleasant is Thy
Spirit, O Lord, in all things!” <span
id="fr_2815"></span>[2816](#fn_2815.md)   And Thou sparest all because they
are Thine, O Lord, who lovest souls.  *Therefore chastenest Thou them*
by little and little that offend, and warnest them of those things
wherein they offend, and dost address them, that leaving their
wickedness, they may believe on Thee, O Lord.” <span
id="fr_2816"></span>[2817](#fn_2816.md)   “But Thou, our God, art gracious
and true, long-suffering, and in mercy ordering all things.  For if we
sin, we are Thine, knowing Thy power.  And if we sin not, we know that
we are counted Thine.” <span id="fr_2817"></span>[2818](#fn_2817.md)   “The
spirit of those that fear the Lord shall be required of him; and in His
regard they shall be blessed.” <span
id="fr_2818"></span>[2819](#fn_2818.md)   Wherefore, most beloved brethren,
“let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which
is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace to the
hearers.  And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed
unto the day of redemption.  Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger,
and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice. 
<span id="page_629">p. 629</span> <span
id="viii.vii-Page_629"></span>And be ye kind one to another,
tender-hearted, forgiving one another, even as God in Christ hath
forgiven you.” <span id="fr_2819"></span>[2820](#fn_2819.md)   “Be ye
therefore followers of God, as dear children; and walk in love, as
Christ also hath loved us, and hath given Himself for us an offering and
a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savour.  But fornication, and
all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as
becometh saints; neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting,
which are not convenient; but rather giving of thanks.  For this know
ye, understanding that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous
man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ
and of God.  Let no man deceive you with vain words:  for because of
these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience. 
Be not ye therefore partakers with them.  For ye were sometimes
darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord:  walk as children of light
(for the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness, and righteousness, and
truth), proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.  And have no
fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove
them.  For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of
them in secret.  But all things that are reproved are made manifest by
the light:  for whatsoever is made manifest (*manifestatur*) is light. 
Wherefore He saith, Awake, thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead,
and Christ shall give thee light.  See then that ye walk circumspectly,
brethren, not as fools, but as wise, redeeming the time, because the
days are evil.  Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the
will of the Lord is.  And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but
be filled with the Holy Spirit; speaking to yourselves in psalms, and
hymns, and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your hearts to
the Lord; giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in
the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, submitting yourselves one to another
in the fear of Christ.” <span id="fr_2820"></span>[2821](#fn_2820.md)  
Therefore, brethren, stand fast and hold the tradition of the apostles
and the apostolic seat, “that our Lord Jesus Christ and our Father,
which hath loved us, and hath given us everlasting consolation and good
hope through grace, may comfort your hearts, and stablish you in every
good work and word.” <span id="fr_2821"></span>[2822](#fn_2821.md)  
“Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have free
course, and be glorified, even as it is with you, and that we may be
delivered from unreasonable and wicked men:  for all men have not
faith.  But the Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep you
from evil.” <span id="fr_2822"></span>[2823](#fn_2822.md)   Wherefore set
your hearts continually in the strength (*virtute*) of God, and always
resist the wicked, and tell these things, according to the word of the
prophet, “to the generations following; for this God is our God unto
eternity, and He will rule us for ever and ever.” <span
id="fr_2823"></span>[2824](#fn_2823.md)   Hence ye who are set for examples
(*in specula*) by the Lord, ought by all means to check and keep back
those who devise crafty counsels against the brethren, or excite against
them seditions and slanders.  For it is an easy thing to deceive man
with a word, but it is not so with the Lord.  Wherefore ye ought to
reprehend such persons, and turn away from them, to the end that, all
darkness of this manner being completely done away, the Morning Star may
shine upon them, and gladness arise in their hearts.  “*And we have*
confidence in the Lord touching you, brethren, that ye both do and will
do the things which we command you.” <span
id="fr_2824"></span>[2825](#fn_2824.md)   For the more ye show forth your
kindnesses to them, the greater a return have ye to look for from the
omnipotent God whom they serve.  May the omnipotent God keep you in His
protection, and grant you to maintain honour and precept; and may glory
and honour be to God the Father Almighty, and to His only-begotten Son
our Saviour, with the Holy Spirit, for ever and ever.  Amen.

<span id="viii.vii-p39"></span>Given on the 12th day before the kalends
of April (the 21st of March), in the consulship of the most illustrious
Maximianus and Africanus.
