Denied.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.v.lii-p2"></span>Then Peter answered:  “Assuredly, with
good reason, I neither believe anything against God, nor against the
just men recorded in the law, taking for granted that they are impious
imaginations.  For, as I am persuaded, neither was Adam a transgressor,
who was fashioned by the hands of God; nor was Noah drunken, who was
found righteous above all the world; <span

at once, who, on account of his sobriety, was thought worthy of a
numerous posterity; nor did Jacob associate with four—of whom two were
sisters—who was the father of the twelve tribes, and who intimated the
coming of the presence of our Master; nor was Moses a murderer, nor did
he learn to judge from an idolatrous priest—he who set forth the law of
God to all the world, and for his right judgment has been testified to
as a faithful steward.
