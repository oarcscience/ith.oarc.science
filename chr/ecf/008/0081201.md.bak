<span id="vii.v.xxiv-p2"></span>And it came to pass, when the most
blessed Mary went into the temple with the little child, that all the
idols prostrated themselves on the ground, so that all of them were
lying on their faces shattered and broken to pieces; <span
id="fr_1664"></span>[1665](#fn_1664.md) and thus they plainly showed that
they were nothing.  Then was fulfilled that which was said by the
prophet Isaiah:  Behold, the Lord will come upon a swift cloud, and will
enter Egypt, and all the handiwork of the Egyptians shall be moved at
His presence. <span id="fr_1665"></span>[1666](#fn_1665.md)
