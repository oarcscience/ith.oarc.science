<span id="vi.iv.xii.v-p2"></span>“Therefore the magician Nebrod, being
destroyed by this lightning falling on earth from heaven, for this
circumstance had his name changed to Zoroaster, on account of the living
(<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.iv.xii.v-p2.1"></span>ζῶσαν</span>)
stream of the star (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.xii.v-p2.2"></span>ἀστέρος</span>) being poured upon him.  But
the unintelligent amongst the men who then were, thinking that through
the love of God his soul had been sent for by lightning, buried the
remains of his body, and honoured his burial-place with a temple among
the Persians, where the descent of the fire occurred, and worshipped him
as a god.  By this example also, others there bury those who die by
lightning as beloved of God, and honour them with temples, and erect
statues of the dead in their own forms.  Thence, in like manner, the
rulers in different places were emulous *of like honour*, and very many
of them honoured the tombs of those who were beloved of them, though not
dying by lightning, with temples and statues, and lighted up altars, and
ordered them to be adored as gods.  And long after, by the lapse of
time, they were thought by posterity to be really gods.
