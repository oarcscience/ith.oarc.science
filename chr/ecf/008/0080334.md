<span id="vi.iii.vii.xx-p2"></span>“Although this word <span
class="c9"><span id="vi.iii.vii.xx-p2.1"></span>God</span> is not the
*name* of God, but meantime that word is employed by men as His name;
and therefore, as I have said, when it is used reproachfully, the
reproach is referred to the injury of the true name.  In short, the
ancient Egyptians, who thought that they had discovered the theory of
the heavenly revolutions and the nature of the stars, nevertheless,
through the demon’s blocking up their senses, subjected the
incommunicable name to all kinds of indignity.  For some taught that
their ox, which is called Apis, ought to be worshipped; others taught
that the he-goat, others that cats, the ibis, a fish also, a serpent,
onions, drains, crepitus ventris, ought to be regarded as deities, and
innumerable other things, which I am ashamed even to mention.”
