id="vi.iii.vi.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIII.—Origin of Idolatry.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.vi.xiii-p2"></span>“But when all these things were
done, men turned again to impiety; <span
id="fr_733"></span>[734](#fn_733) and on this account a law was given by
God to instruct them in the manner of living.  But in process of time,
the worship of God and righteousness were corrupted by the unbelieving
and the wicked, as we shall show more fully by and by.  Moreover,
perverse and erratic religions were introduced, to which the greater
part of men gave themselves up, by occasion of holidays and solemnities,
instituting drinkings and banquets, following pipes, and flutes, and
harps, and diverse kinds of musical instruments, and indulging
themselves in all kinds of drunkenness and luxury.  Hence every kind of
error took rise; hence they invented groves and altars, fillets and
victims, and after drunkenness they were agitated as if with mad
emotions.  By this means power was given to the demons to enter into
minds of this sort, so that they seemed to lead insane dances and to
rave like Bacchanalians; hence were invented the gnashing of teeth, and
bellowing from the depth of their bowels; hence a terrible countenance
and a fierce aspect in men, so that he whom drunkenness had subverted
and a demon had instigated, was believed by the deceived and the erring
to be filled with the Deity.
