<span id="vi.iii.vi.vi-p2"></span>“But enough has been said of these
things for time presses, and the religious devotion of the people
invites us to address them.”  And when he had thus spoken, he asked
where there was a suitable place for discussion.  And Maro said:  “I
have a very spacious hall <span id="fr_727"></span>[728](#fn_727.md) which
can hold more than five hundred men, and there is also a garden within
the house; or if it please you to be in some public place, all would
prefer it, for there is nobody who does not desire at least to see your
face.”  Then Peter said:  “Show me the hall, or the garden.”  And when
he had seen the hall, he went in to see the garden also; and suddenly
the whole multitude, as if some one had called them, rushed into the
house, and thence broke through into the garden, where Peter was already
standing, selecting a fit place for discussion.
