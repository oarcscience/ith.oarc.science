id="vi.iii.vii.xxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIX.—God’s Care of Human
Things.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.vii.xxix-p2"></span>“But perhaps some of you will say,
God has no care of human things; and if we cannot even attain to the
knowledge of Him, how shall we attain to His friendship?  That God does
concern Himself with the affairs of men, His government of the world
bears witness:  for the sun daily waits upon it, the showers minister to
it; the fountains, rivers, winds, and all elements, attend upon it; and
the more these things become known to men, the more do they indicate
God’s care over men.  For unless by the power of the Most High, the more
powerful would never minister to the inferior; and by this God is shown
to have not only a care over men, but some great affection, since He has
deputed such noble elements to their service.  But that men may also
attain to the friendship of God, is proved to us by the example of those
to whose prayers He has been so favourable, that He has withheld the
heaven from rain when they wished, and has again opened it when they
prayed. <span id="fr_767"></span>[768](#fn_767.md)   And many other things
He has bestowed upon those who does His will, which could not be
bestowed but upon His friends.  But you will say, What harm is done to
God if these things also are worshipped by us?  If any one of you should
pay to another the honour that is due to his father, from whom he has
received innumerable benefits, and should reverence a stranger and
foreigner as his father, should you not think that he was undutiful
towards his father, and most deserving to be disinherited?
