<span id="vi.iii.xii.lvii-p2"></span>And when all of us, along with my
father, were agitated with sorrow and weeping, meantime Anubion came to
us, intimating to us that Simon had fled during the night, making for
Judæa.  But seeing our father lamenting and bewailing himself, and
saying, “Wretch that I am, not to believe when I heard that he is a
magician!  What has befallen wretched me, that on one day, being
recognised by my wife and my sons, I have not been able to rejoice with
them, but have been rolled back to the former miseries which I endured
in my wandering!”—but my mother, tearing her dishevelled hair, bewailed
much more bitterly,—we also, confounded at the change of our father’s
countenance, were, as it were, thunderstruck and beside ourselves, and
could not understand what was the matter.  But Anubion, seeing us all
thus afflicted, stood like one dumb.  Then Peter, looking at us his
sons, said:  “Believe me that this is your very father; wherefore also I
charge you that you respect him as your father.  For God will afford
some opportunity on which he shall be able to put off the countenance of
Simon, and to recover the manifest figure of your father—that is, his
own.”
