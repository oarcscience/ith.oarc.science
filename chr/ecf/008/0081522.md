id="x.viii-Page_766"></span><span class="c6"><span

<span id="x.viii-p3"></span>\[<span class="c9"><span
id="x.viii-p3.1"></span>a.d.</span> 180.\]  This Rhodon <span
id="fr_3717"></span>[3718](#fn_3717.md) was supposed by St. Jerome to have
been the author of the work against the Cataphrygians, ascribed to
Asterius Urbanus more probably. <span
id="fr_3718"></span>[3719](#fn_3718.md)   Eusebius <span
id="fr_3719"></span>[3720](#fn_3719.md) gives us the fragment from his work
against Marcion, addressed to Callistion, which is here translated.  He
tells us that he was a pupil of Tatian, and expresses an intention of
furnishing original solutions of Scriptural problems stated by
Tatian, <span id="fr_3720"></span>[3721](#fn_3720.md) and by that author
explained in a manner apparently unsatisfactory.  He also appears to
have written against the blasphemous Apelles, <span
id="fr_3721"></span>[3722](#fn_3721.md) whose *Hexaëmeron* was an attempt
to refute Moses; but whether he also fulfilled his promise concerning an
<span class="Greek"><span id="x.viii-p8.1"></span>᾽Επίλυσις</span> of
Tatian’s Problems (or Questions), seems doubtful.  Routh has devoted to
the fragment here translated six pages of notes, <span
id="fr_3722"></span>[3723](#fn_3722.md) which he subjoins to the Greek text
(of Eusebius) and a Latin version of the same.

<span id="x.viii-p10"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="x.viii-p10.1"></span>Wherefore</span> also they <span
id="fr_3723"></span>[3724](#fn_3723.md) disagree among themselves,
maintaining as they do an opinion which has no consistency with itself. 
For one of their herd, Apelles, who prides himself on the strictness of
his life, <span id="fr_3724"></span>[3725](#fn_3724.md) and on his age,
admits that there is *only* one first principle, <span
id="fr_3725"></span>[3726](#fn_3725.md) yet says that the prophecies *have
come* from an opposing spirit, in which opinion he is influenced by the
responses of a soothsaying <span id="fr_3726"></span>[3727](#fn_3726.md)
maid named Philumene.  But others, among whom are Potitus and Basilicus,
like Marcion <span id="fr_3727"></span>[3728](#fn_3727.md) himself,
introduce two first principles.  These men, following the Pontic wolf,
and not being able to discover any more than he the division of things,
have had to recourse to rash assertion, and declared the existence of
two first principles simply and without proof.  Others of them, again,
drifting *from bad* to worse, assume not two only, but even three
natures.  Of these men the leader and champion is Syneros, as those who
adopt his teaching say.…

<span id="x.viii-p16"></span>For the old man Apelles entered into
conversation with us, and was convicted of uttering many false
opinions.  For example, he asserted that men should on no account
examine into their creed, <span id="fr_3728"></span>[3729](#fn_3728.md) but
that every one ought to continue to the last in the belief he has once
adopted.  For he declared that those who had rested their hope on the
Crucified One would be saved, provided only they were found living in
the practice of good works.  But the most perplexing of all the
doctrines laid down by him was, as we have remarked before, what he said
concerning God:  for he affirmed that there was *only* one first
principle, precisely as our own faith teaches.…

<span id="x.viii-p18"></span>On asking him, “Where do you get proof of
this? or how are you able to assert that there is *only* one first
principle? tell us,”—he said that the prophecies refuted themselves,
because they had uttered nothing at all that was true:  for that they
were discordant and false, and self-contradictory.  As to the question,
“How does it appear that there is *only* one first principle?” he said
he could not tell, only he was impelled to that belief.  On my thereupon
conjuring him to speak the truth, he solemnly declared that he was
expressing his real sentiments; and that he did not know “how” there
could be one uncreated God, but that he believed the fact.  Here I burst
into laughter and rebuked him, because he professed to be a teacher, and
yet was unable to confirm *by arguments* what he taught.
