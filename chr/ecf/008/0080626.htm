<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.iv.xvi-p2"></A>Then the blessed man, springing forward as soon as he heard my name, kissed me; and making me sit down, straightway said, &#8220;You acted nobly in entertaining Barnabas, a herald of the truth, to the honour of the living God, being magnanimously not ashamed, nor fearing the resentment of the rude multitude.&#160; Blessed shall you be.&#160; For as you thus with all honour entertained the ambassador of the truth, so also truth herself shall constitute you, who are a stranger, a citizen of her own city.&#160; And thus you shall greatly rejoice, because you have now lent a small favour; I mean the kindness of good words.&#160; You shall be heir of blessings which are both eternal and cannot possibly be taken from you.&#160; And do not trouble yourself to detail to me your manner of life; for the veracious Barnabas has detailed to us everything relating to you, making favourable mention of you almost every day.&#160; And in order that I may tell to you briefly, as to a genuine friend, what is in hand, travel with us, unless anything hinders you, partaking of the words of truth which I am going to speak from city to city, as far as Rome itself.&#160; And if you wish <i>to say</i> anything, speak on.&#8221;</p>
