<span id="vi.iv.vi.xxxii-p2"></span>“Do you, therefore, as thankful
servants of God, perceiving of yourselves what is reasonable, take upon
you the manner of life that is pleasing to Him, that so, loving Him, and
being loved of Him, you may enjoy good for ever.  For to Him alone is it
most possible to bestow it, who gave being to things that were not, who
created the heavens, settled the earth, set bounds to the sea, stored up
the things that are in Hades, and filled all places with air.
