 which you had explained to him,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1230"></A><A HREF="#fn_1230"><FONT SIZE="1">1231</FONT></A>
 which rather appeared to me to be very unjust, and I shall tell you how.&#160; He alleged that it was right to present to him who strikes you on the one cheek the other&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1231"></A><A HREF="#fn_1231"><FONT SIZE="1">1232</FONT></A>
 also, and to give to him who takes away your cloak your tunic also, and to go two miles with him who compels you to go one, and such like.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1232"></A><A HREF="#fn_1232"><FONT SIZE="1">1233</FONT></A>
