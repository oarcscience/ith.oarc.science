id="vi.iii.xii.lxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter LXI.—A Mine Dug.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.xii.lxi-p2"></span>“When therefore you come with them
to Antioch, as you will be thought to be Simon, stand in a public place,
and proclaim your repentance, and say:  ‘I Simon declare to you, and
confess that all that I said concerning Peter was false:  for he is
neither a seducer, nor a magician, nor a murderer, nor any of the things
that I spoke against him; but I said all these things under the
instigation of madness.  I therefore entreat you, even I myself, who
erewhile gave you causes of hatred against him, that you think no such
thing concerning him.  But lay aside your hatred; cease from your
indignation; because he is truly sent by God for the salvation of the
world—a disciple and apostle of the true Prophet.  Wherefore I advise,
exhort, and charge you that you hear him, and believe him when he
preaches to you the truth, lest haply, if you despise him, your very
city suddenly perish.  But I will tell you why I now make this
confession to you.  This night an angel of God rebuked me for my
wickedness, and scourged me terribly, because I was an enemy to the
herald of the truth.  Therefore I entreat you, that even if I myself
should ever again come to you, and attempt to say anything against
Peter, you will not receive nor believe me.  For I confess to you, I was
a magician, a seducer, a deceiver; but I repent, for it is possible by
repentance to blot out former evil deeds.’”
