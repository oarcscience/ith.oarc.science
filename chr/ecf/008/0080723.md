id="vi.iv.vi.xxxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXVI.—Dominion Over the
Creatures.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.vi.xxxvi-p2"></span>“Therefore, if any one shall
accurately scan the whole with reason, he shall find that God has made
them for the sake of man.  For showers fall for the sake of fruits, that
man may partake of them, and that animals may be fed, that they may be
useful to men.  And the sun shines, that he may turn the air into four
seasons, and that each time may afford its peculiar service to man.  And
the fountains spring, that drink may be given to men.  And, moreover,
who is lord over the creatures, so far as is possible?  Is it not man,
who has received wisdom to till the earth, to sail the sea:  to make
fishes, birds, and beasts his prey; to investigate the course of the
stars, to mine the earth, to sail the sea; to build cities, to define
kingdoms, to ordain laws, to execute justice, to know the invisible God,
to be cognizant of the names of angels, to drive away demons, to
endeavour to cure diseases by medicines, to find charms against
poison-darting serpents, to understand antipathies?
