id="vi.iv.v.xlii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLII.—Right Notions of God
Essential to Holiness.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.v.xlii-p2"></span>“But what I am going to tell you will
be sufficient by way of example.  But I do not think, my dear Clement,
that any one who possesses ever so little love to God and ingenuousness,
will be able to take in, or even to hear, the things that are spoken
against Him.  For how is it that he can have a monarchic <span
id="fr_948"></span>[949](#fn_948) soul, and be holy, who supposes that
there are many gods, and not one only?  But even if there be but one,
who will cherish zeal to be holy, that finds in Him many defects, since
he will hope that the Beginning of all things, by reason of the defects
of his own nature, will not visit the crimes of others?

<span id="vi.iv.v.xlii-p3"></span> Cotelerius doubts whether this
expression means a soul ruling over his body, or a soul disposed to
favor monarchical rule.  The former explanation seems more probable.
