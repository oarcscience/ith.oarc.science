Delay.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iii.xxi-p2"></span>To this Peter answered:  “Tell Simon
in the meantime to do as he pleases, and to rest assured that, Divine
Providence granting, he shall always find us ready.”  Then Zacchæus went
out to intimate to Simon what he had been told.  But Peter, looking at
us, and perceiving that I was saddened by the putting off of the
contest, said:  “He who believes that the world is administered by the
providence of the Most High God, ought not, O Clement, my friend, to
take it amiss, in whatever way particular things happen, being assured
that the righteousness of God guides to a favourable and fitting issue
even those things which seem superfluous or contrary in any business,
and especially towards those who worship Him more intimately; and
therefore he who is assured of these things, as I have said, if anything
occur contrary to his expectation, he knows how to drive away grief from
his mind on that account, holding it unquestionable in his better
judgment, that, by the government of the good God, even what seems
contrary may be turned to good.  Wherefore, O Clement, even now let not
this delay of the magician Simon sadden you:  for I believe that it has
been done by the providence of God, for your advantage; that I may be
able, in this interval of seven days, to expound to you the method of
our faith without any distraction, and the order continuously, according
to the tradition of the true Prophet, who alone knows the past as it
was, the present as it is, and the future as it shall be:  which things
were indeed plainly spoken *by Him*, but are not plainly written; so
much so, that when they are read, they cannot be understood without an
expounder, on account of the sin which has grown up with men, as I said
before.  Therefore I shall explain all things to you, that in those
things which are written you may clearly perceive what is the mind of
the Lawgiver.”
