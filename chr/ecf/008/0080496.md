Untenable.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.xi.xxvii-p2"></span>“Moreover, we ought to remember the
things which have been mentioned, that in the one country of India there
are both persons who feed on human flesh, and persons who abstain even
from the flesh of sheep, and birds, and all living creatures; and that
the Magusæi marry their mothers and daughters not only in Persia, but
that in every nation where they dwell they keep up their incestuous
customs. <span id="fr_846"></span>[847](#fn_846)   Then, besides, we
have mentioned also innumerable nations, which are wholly ignorant of
the studies of literature, and also some wise men have changed the laws
themselves in several places; and some laws have been voluntarily
abandoned, on account of the impossibility of observing them, or on
account of their baseness.  Assuredly we can easily ascertain how many
rulers have changed the laws and customs of nations which they have
conquered, and subjected them to their own laws.  This is manifestly
done by the Romans, who have brought under the Roman law and the civil
decrees almost the whole world, and all nations who formerly lived under
various laws and customs of their own.  It follows, therefore, that the
stars of the nations which have been conquered by the Romans have lost
their climates and their portions.

customs of their evils, or of their evil persons.”  Hilgenfeld
(*Bardesanes*, p. 113) notices that it should be, “of their ancestors.”
