<span id="v.iv.v-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V.—Where There is Only One Woman, the
Father Does Not Make a Stay; How Carefully Stumbling-Blocks Must Be
Avoided.</span>

<span id="v.iv.v-p2"></span>But if, moreover, we chance upon a place,
and find there one believing woman only, and no other person be there
but she only, we do not stop there, nor pray there, nor read the
Scriptures there, but we flee as from before the face of a serpent, and
as from before the face of sin.  Not that we disdain the believing
woman—far be it from us to be so minded towards our brethren in
Christ!—but, because she is alone, we are afraid lest any one should
make insinuations against us in words of falsehood.  For the hearts of
men are firmly set <span id="fr_452"></span>[453](#fn_452.md) on evil. 
And, that we may not give a pretext to those who desire to get a pretext
against us and to speak evil of us, and that we may not be a
stumbling-block to any one, on this account we cut off the pretext of
those who desire to get a pretext against us; on this account we must be
“on our guard that we be to no one a stumbling-block, neither to the
Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor yet to the Church of God; and we must not
seek that which is profitable to ourselves only, but that which is for
the profit of many, so that they may be saved.” <span
id="fr_453"></span>[454](#fn_453.md)   For this does not profit us, that
another stumble because of us.  Let us, therefore, be studiously on our
guard at all times, that we do not smite our brethren and give them to
drink of a disquieting conscience through our being to them a
stumbling-block.  For “if for the sake of meat our brother be made sad,
or shocked, or made weak, or caused to stumble, we are not walking in
the love of God.  For the sake of meat thou causest him to perish for
whose sake Christ died.” <span id="fr_454"></span>[455](#fn_454.md)   For,
*in* “thus sinning against your brethren and wounding their sickly
consciences, ye sin against Christ Himself.  For, if for the sake of
meat my brother is made to stumble,” let us *who are* believers say,
“Never will we eat flesh, that we may not make our brother to
stumble.” <span id="fr_455"></span>[456](#fn_455.md)   These things,
moreover, does ever one who truly loves God, who truly takes up his
cross, and puts on Christ, and loves his neighbour; the man who watches
over himself that he be not a stumbling-block to any one, that no one be
caused to stumble because of him and die because he is constantly with
maidens and lives in the same house with them—a thing which is not
right—to the overthrow of those who see and hear.  Evil conduct like
this is fraught with stumbling and peril, and *is* akin <span
id="fr_456"></span>[457](#fn_456.md) to death.  But blessed is that man who
is circumspect and fearful in everything for the sake of purity!
