id="vi.iii.viii.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—Necessity of
Baptism.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.viii.viii-p2"></span>“But now I lead you to
understanding by the same paths.  For you see that all things are
produced from waters.  But water was made at first by the Only-begotten;
and the Almighty God is the head of the Only-begotten, by whom we come
to the Father in such order as we have stated above.  But when you have
come to the Father you will learn that this is His will, that you be
born anew by means of waters, which were first created. <span
id="fr_782"></span>[783](#fn_782.md)   For he who is regenerated by water,
having filled up the measure of good works, is made heir of Him by whom
he has been regenerated in incorruption.  Wherefore, with prepared
minds, approach as sons to a father, that your sins may be washed away,
and it may be proved before God that ignorance was their sole cause. 
For if, after the learning of these things, you remain in unbelief, the
cause of your destruction will be imputed to yourselves, and not to
ignorance.  And do you suppose that you can have hope towards God, even
if you cultivate all piety and all righteousness, but do not receive
baptism.  Yea rather, he will be worthy or greater punishment, who does
good works not well; for merit accrues to men from good works, but only
if they be done as God commands.  Now God <span id="page_155">p.
155</span> <span id="vi.iii.viii.viii-Page_155"></span>has ordered every
one who worships Him to be sealed by baptism; but if you refuse, and
obey your own will rather than God’s, you are doubtless contrary and
hostile to His will.
