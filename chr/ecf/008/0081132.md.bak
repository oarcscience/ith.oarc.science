Devil.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxii.xiii-p2"></span>And Peter said:  “Now indeed our
object is to show how and by whom the evil one came into being, since he
did come into being; but we shall show if he came into being
blamelessly, when we have finished the subject now in hand.  Then I
shall show how and on account of what he came into being, and I shall
fully convince you that his Creator is blameless. <span
id="fr_1431"></span>[1432](#fn_1431.md)   We said, then, that the four
substances were produced by God.  And thus, through the volition of Him
who mingled them, arose, as He wished, the choice of evils.  For if it
had arisen contrary to His determination, or from some other substance
or cause, then God would not have had firmness of will:  for perchance,
even though He should not wish it, leaders of evil might continually
arise, who would war against His wishes.  But it is impossible that this
should be the case.  For no living being, and especially one capable of
giving guidance, can arise from accident:  for everything that is
produced must be produced by some one.”
