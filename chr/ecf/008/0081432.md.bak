<span id="viii.viii.iii.i-p3"></span>That extraneous judgments should be
rejected, and that the accused person should carry out his cause in his
own locality; and that every one who brings forward a charge should
intimate in writing his ability to prove it, and that if he fails to
prove what he alleges, he should bear the penalty which he advanced.

<span id="viii.viii.iii.i-p4"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="viii.viii.iii.i-p4.1"></span>Fabian</span>, to my dearly beloved
brother Bishop Hilary.

<span id="viii.viii.iii.i-p5"></span>We ought to be mindful of the grace
of God to us, who, in the compassion of His own regard, hath raised us
for this reason to the summit of sacerdotal dignity, that by cleaving to
His commandments, and by being set in a certain eminence as overseers of
His priests, we may restrain things unlawful, and inculcate things that
are to be followed.  For we have heard that in those western parts in
which you dwell, the craft of the devil rageth so violently against the
people of Christ, and breaketh forth in delusions so manifold, that it
oppresseth and troubleth not only the secular laity, but the priests of
the Lord themselves also.  Wherefore, involved as we are in deep grief,
we cannot conceal what we ought severely to correct.  Accordingly a
sufficient remedy must be employed for such wounds, lest a hasty
facility in the cure may prove of no service for the deadly disease of
the head; and lest the trouble, by being too easily dealt with, may
involve, through the defect of an illegitimate mode of cure, the hurt
and the healers together in its evil.
