<span id="vi.iv.v.xlix-p2"></span>Then Peter answered:  “You have
presented us with a matter that can easily be answered.  However,
listen, how God is ignorant of nothing, but even foreknows.  But first
answer me what I ask of you.  He who wrote the Bible, and told how the
world was made, and said that God does not foreknow, was he a man or
not?”  Then I said:  “He was a man.”  Then Peter answered:  “How, then,
was it possible for him, being a man, to know assuredly how the world
was made, and that God does not foreknow?”
