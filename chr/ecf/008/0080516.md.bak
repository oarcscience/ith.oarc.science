<span id="vi.iii.xii.viii-p2"></span>Then my father answered:  “But as
the harmfulness of an inharmonious conjunction of elements or stars is
immediately betrayed, so ought also adultery to be immediately shown
that it is an evil.”  Then I:  “First tell me this, whether, as you
yourself have confessed, evils are produced from incongruous and
inharmonious mixture; and then after that we shall inquire into the
other matter.”  Then my father said:  “The nature of things is as you
say, my son.”  Then I answered:  “Since, then, you wish to learn of
these things, see how many things there are which no one doubts to be
evils.  Do you think that a fever, a fire, sedition, the fall of a
house, murder, holds, racks, pains, mournings, and such like, are
evils?”  Then said my father:  “It is true, my son, that these things
are evil, and very evil; or, at all events, whoever denies that they are
evil, let him suffer them!”
