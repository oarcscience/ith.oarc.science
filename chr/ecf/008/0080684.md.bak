<span id="vi.iv.v.li-p2"></span>Then Peter said:  “If, therefore, some
of the Scriptures are true and some false, with good reason said our
Master, ‘Be ye good money-changers,’ <span
id="fr_951"></span>[952](#fn_951.md) inasmuch as in the Scriptures there
are some true sayings and some spurious.  And to those who err by reason
of the false scriptures He fitly showed the cause of their error,
saying, ‘Ye do therefore err, not knowing the true things of the
Scriptures; <span id="fr_952"></span>[953](#fn_952.md) for this reason ye
are ignorant also of the power of God.’”  Then said I:  “*You have
spoken* very excellently.”

<span id="vi.iv.v.li-p3"></span> This is quoted three times in the
*Homilies* as a saying of our Lord, viz., here and in Homily III. chap.
50, and Homily XVIII. chap. 20.  It is probably taken from one of the
apocryphal Gospels.  In Homily XVIII. chap. 20 the meaning is shown to
be, that as it is the part of a money-changer to distinguish spurious
coins from genuine, so it is part of a Christian to distinguish false
statements from true.
