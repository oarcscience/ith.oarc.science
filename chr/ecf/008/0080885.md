id="vi.iv.xii.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II.—Monarchy and Polyarchy.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xii.ii-p2"></span>“If, therefore, while I expound and
show you that this is the greatest sin, which is able to destroy you
all, it occur to your mind that you are not destroyed, being great
multitudes, you are deceived.  For you have the example of the old world
deluged.  And yet their sin was much less than that which is chargeable
against you.  For they were wicked with respect to their equals,
murdering or committing adultery.  But you are wicked against the God of
all, worshipping lifeless images instead of Him or along with Him, and
attributing His divine name to every kind of senseless matter.  In the
first place, therefore, you are unfortunate in not knowing the
difference between monarchy and polyarchy—that monarchy, on the one
hand, is productive of concord, but polyarchy is effective of wars.  For
unity does not fight with itself, but multitude has occasion of
undertaking battle one against another.
