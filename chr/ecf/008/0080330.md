<span id="vi.iii.vii.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iii.vii.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVI.—God Alone a Fit Object of
Worship.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.vii.xvi-p2"></span>“Oh! into what wretched plight the
understanding of men has fallen!  For if it is reckoned the greatest
folly to fear the dead, what shall we judge of those who fear something
that is worse than the dead are?  For those images are not even to be
reckoned among the number of the dead, because they were never alive. 
Even the sepulchres of the dead are preferable to them, since, although
they are now dead, yet they once had life; but those whom you worship
never possessed even such base life as is in all, the life of frogs and
owls.  But why say more about them, since it is enough to say to him who
adores them:  Do you not see that he whom you adore sees not, hear that
he whom you adore hears not, and understand that he understands not?—for
he is the work of man’s hand, and necessarily is void of understanding. 
You therefore worship a god without sense, whereas every one who has
sense believes that not even those things are to be worshipped which
have been made by God and have sense, <span
id="fr_762"></span>[763](#fn_762.md) such as the sun, moon, and <span
id="page_147">p. 147</span> <span
id="vi.iii.vii.xvi-Page_147"></span>stars, and all things that are in
heaven and upon earth.  For they think it reasonable, that not those
things which have been made for the service of the world, but the
Creator of those things themselves, and of the whole world, should be
worshipped.  For even these things rejoice when He is adored and
worshipped, and do not take it well that the honour of the Creator
should be bestowed on the creature.  For the worship of God alone is
acceptable *to them,* who alone is uncreated, and all things also are
His creatures.  For as it belongs to him who alone is uncreated to be
God, so everything that has been created is not truly God.

<span id="vi.iii.vii.xvi-p3"></span> It was a very prevalent opinion
among the ancient philosophers, that the heavenly bodies have some kind
of life and intelligence.
