<span id="vi.iv.xiv.xxiv-p2"></span>“And now from inferior things learn
the cause of all, reasoning that water makes all things, and water
receives the production of its movement from spirit, and the spirit has
its beginning from the God of all.  And thus you ought to have reasoned,
in order that by reason you might attain to God, that, knowing your
origin, and being born again by the first-born water, you may be
constituted heir of the parents who have begotten you to incorruption.
