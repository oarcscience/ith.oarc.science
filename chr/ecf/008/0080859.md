<span id="vi.iv.xi.i-p3"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iv.xi.i-p3.1"></span>Now</span>, as Peter was entering
Tripolis, <span id="fr_1084"></span>[1085](#fn_1084) the people from
Tyre and Sidon, Berytus and Byblus, who were eager <span
id="fr_1085"></span>[1086](#fn_1085) to get instruction, and many from
the neighbourhood, entered along with him; and not least were there
gatherings of the multitudes from the city itself wishing to see him. 
Therefore there met with us in the suburbs the brethren who had been
sent forth by him to ascertain as well other particulars respecting the
city, as the proceedings of Simon, and to come and explain them.  They
received him, and conducted him to the house of Maroones. <span
