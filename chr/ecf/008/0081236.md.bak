Jesus According to Thomas.</span>

<span id="vii.x.i-p3"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="vii.x.i-p3.1"></span>Chapter I.—How Mary and Joseph Fled with Him
into Egypt.</span>

<span id="vii.x.i-p4"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.x.i-p4.1"></span>When</span> a commotion took place in
consequence of the search made by Herod for our Lord Jesus Christ to
kill Him, then an angel said to Joseph:  Take Mary and her boy, and flee
into Egypt from the face of those who seek to kill Him.  And Jesus was
two years old when He went into Egypt.

<span id="vii.x.i-p5"></span>And as He was walking through a field of
corn, He stretched forth His hand, and took of the ears, and put them
over the fire, and rubbed them, and began to eat.

<span id="vii.x.i-p6"></span>And when they had come into Egypt, they
received hospitality in the house of a certain widow, and they remained
in the same place one year.

<span id="vii.x.i-p7"></span>And Jesus was in His third year.  And
seeing boys playing, He began to play with them.  And He took a dried
fish, and put it into a basin, and ordered it to move about.  And it
began to move about.  And He said again to the fish:  Throw out thy salt
which thou hast, and walk into the water.  And it so came to pass.  And
the neighbours, seeing what had been done, told it to the widow woman in
whose house Mary His mother lived.  And as soon as she heard it, she
thrust them out of her house with great haste.
