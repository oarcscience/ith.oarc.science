<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.viii.xix-p2"></A>&#8220;&#145;I know that to those uninitiated in the truth these things seem dreadful and most base; but not so to the gods and the philosophers of the Greeks, nor to those initiated in the mysteries of Dionysus and Demeter.&#160; But above all these, not to waste time in speaking of the lives of all the gods, and all the philosophers, let the two chief be your marks&#8212;Zeus the greatest of the gods, and Socrates of philosophic men.&#160; And the other things which I have mentioned in this letter, understand and attend to, that you may not grieve your lover; since, if you act contrarily to gods and heroes, you will be judged wicked, and will subject yourself to fitting punishment.&#160; But if you offer yourself to every lover, then, as an imitator of the gods, you shall receive benefits from them.&#160; For the rest, dearest one, remember what mysteries I have disclosed to you, and inform me by letter of your choice.&#160; Fare thee well.&#146;</p>
