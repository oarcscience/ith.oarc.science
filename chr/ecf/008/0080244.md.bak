<span id="vi.iii.v.xxxiv-p2"></span>Then Peter:  “I shall speak so that
it may be proved to you before all the rest.  Answer me, therefore,
which of the two can better persuade an incredulous man, seeing or
hearing?”  Then Simon said:  “Seeing.”  Then Peter:  “Why then do you
wish to learn from me by words, what is proved to you by the thing
itself and by sight?”  Then Simon:  “I know not what you mean.”  Then
Peter:  “If you do not know, go now to your house, and entering the
inner bed-chamber you will see an image placed, containing the figure of
a murdered boy clothed in purple; ask him, and he will inform you either
by hearing or seeing.  For what need is there to hear from him if the
soul is immortal, when you see it standing before you?  For if it were
not in being, it assuredly could not be seen.  But if you know not what
image I speak of, let us straightway go to your house, with ten other
men, of those who are here present.” <span
