<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xxi.xiii-p2"></A>And Peter said:&#160; &#8220;I shall reply to that which you wish me to speak of,&#8212;namely, the passage, &#145;No one knows the Father but the Son, nor does any one know the Son but the Father, and they to <A NAME="page_328"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 328</FONT></A> <a name="vi.iv.xxi.xiii-Page_328"></A>whom the Son may wish to reveal Him.&#146;&#160; First, then, I am astonished that, while this statement admits of countless interpretations, you should have chosen the very dangerous position of maintaining that the statement is made in reference to the ignorance of the Creator (Demiurge), and all who are under him.&#160; For, first, the statement can apply to all the Jews who think that David is the father of Christ, and that Christ himself is his son, and do not know that He is the Son of God.&#160; Wherefore it is appropriately said, &#145;No one knows the Father,&#146; since, instead of God, they affirmed David to be His father; and the additional remark, that no one knows even the Son, is quite correct, since they did not know that He was the Son.&#160; The statement also, &#145;to whomsoever the Son may wish to reveal Him,&#146; is also correct; for He being the Son from the beginning, was alone appointed to give the revelation to those to whom He wishes to give it.&#160; And thus the first man (protoplast) Adam must have heard of Him; and Enoch, who pleased <i>God</i>, must have known Him; and Noah, the righteous one, must have become acquainted with Him; and Abraam His friend must have understood Him; and Isaac must have perceived Him; and Jacob, who wrestled with Him, must have believed in Him; and the revelation must have been given to all among the people who were worthy.</p>
