Valour.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.vii.v-p2"></span>“Wherefore I do not think that any one
will be able to quench such a fire as has been kindled.  For no one
doubts his promises; but every one affirms that this is so.  Wherefore,
lest you should expose yourselves to danger, I advise you not to attempt
anything against him until Peter come, who alone shall be able to resist
such a power, being the most esteemed disciple of our Lord Jesus
Christ.  For so much do I fear this man, that if he had not elsewhere
been vanquished in disputing with my lord Peter, I should counsel you to
persuade even Peter himself not to attempt to oppose Simon.”
