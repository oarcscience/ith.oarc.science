<p class="c21"><a name="vii.xv.iv-p2"></A>Pilate, filled with fury, went forth outside of the pr&aelig;torium, and says to them:&#160; I take the sun to witness that I find in this man not even one fault.&#160; The Jews answered and said to the governor:&#160; If he were not an evil-doer, we should never have delivered him to thee.&#160; Pilate says to them:&#160; Take him, and judge him according to your law.&#160; The Jews answered:&#160; It is not permitted to us to put any one to death.&#160; Pilate says to them:&#160; Has God said to you not to put any one to death? has He therefore said to me that I am to kill?</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xv.iv-p3"></A>Pilate, having again gone into the pr&aelig;torium, called Jesus to him privately, and said to Him:&#160; Art thou the king of the Jews?&#160; Jesus answered Pilate:&#160; Speakest thou this of thyself, or have others said <i>it</i> to thee of me?&#160; Pilate answered:&#160; Am I a Jew?&#160; Thy nation and the chief priests have delivered thee to me.&#160; What hast thou done?&#160; Jesus answering, said:&#160; My kingdom is not of this world.&#160; If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would assuredly strive that I should not be delivered to the Jews; but now my kingdom is not from hence.&#160; Pilate said to Him:&#160; Art thou then a king?&#160; Jesus said to him:&#160; Thou sayest that I am a king.&#160; For I for this was born, and for this have I come, that I should bear witness to the truth; and every one who is of the truth hears my voice.&#160; Pilate says to him:&#160; What is truth?&#160; Jesus says:&#160; Truth is from heaven.&#160; Pilate says:&#160; Is not there truth upon earth?&#160; Jesus says to Pilate:&#160; Notice how the truth-speaking are judged by those who have power upon earth.</p>
