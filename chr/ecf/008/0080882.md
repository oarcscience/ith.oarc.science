<span id="vi.iv.xi.xxiv-p2"></span>When he had thus spoken, all of them
remained, some in order to be healed, and others to see those who
obtained cures.  But Peter, only laying his hands upon them, and
praying, healed them; <span id="fr_1106"></span>[1107](#fn_1106) so that
those who were straightway cured were exceeding glad, and those who
looked on exceedingly wondered, and blessed God, and believed with a
firm hope, and with those who had been healed departed to their own
homes, having received a charge to meet early on the following day.  And
when they had gone, Peter remained there with his associates, and
partook of food, and refreshed himself with sleep.
