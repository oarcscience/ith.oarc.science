id="vi.iii.iii.xxx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXX.—Noah’s Sons.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iii.xxx-p2"></span>“In the twelfth generation, when God
had blessed men, and they had begun to multiply, <span
id="fr_550"></span>[551](#fn_550.md) they received a commandment that they
should not taste blood, for on account of this also the deluge had been
sent.  In the thirteenth generation, when the second of Noah’s three
sons had done an injury to his father, and had been cursed by him, he
brought the condition of slavery upon his posterity.  His elder brother
meantime obtained the lot of a dwelling-place in the middle region of
the world, in which is the country of Judæa; the younger obtained the
eastern quarter, and he the western.  In the fourteenth generation one
of the cursed progeny first erected an altar to demons, for the purpose
of magical arts, and offered there bloody sacrifices.  In the fifteenth
generation, for the first time, men set up an idol and worshipped it. 
Until that time the Hebrew language, which had been given by God to men,
bore sole sway.  In the sixteenth generation the sons of men migrated
from the east, and, coming to the lands that had been assigned to their
fathers, each one marked the place of his own allotment by his own
name.  In the seventeenth generation Nimrod I. reigned in Babylonia, and
built a city, and thence mi<span id="page_86">p. 86</span> <span
id="vi.iii.iii.xxx-Page_86"></span>grated to the Persians, and taught
them to worship fire.” <span id="fr_551"></span>[552](#fn_551.md)
