<span id="vi.iv.xxiii.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.xxiii.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII.—The Objection Answered,
that One Cannot Change Himself.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxiii.vii-p2"></span>“But perhaps some one of you thinks
that one may become something under the influence of one, and another
under the influence of another, but no one can change himself into
whatever he wishes, and that it is the characteristic of one who grows
old, and who must die according to his nature, <span
id="fr_1501"></span>[1502](#fn_1501) to change, but we ought not to
entertain such thoughts of immortal beings.  For were not angels, who
are free from old age, and of a fiery substance, <span
id="fr_1502"></span>[1503](#fn_1502) changed into flesh,—those, for
instance, who received the hospitality of Abraham, <span
id="fr_1503"></span>[1504](#fn_1503) whose feet men washed, as if they
were the feet of men of like substance? <span
id="fr_1504"></span>[1505](#fn_1504)   Yea, moreover, with Jacob, <span
id="fr_1505"></span>[1506](#fn_1505) who was a man, there wrestled an
angel, converted into flesh that he might be able to come to close
quarters with him.  And, in like manner, after he had wrestled by his
own will, he was converted into his own natural form; and now, when he
was changed into fire, he did not burn up the broad sinew of Jacob, but
he inflamed it, and made him lame.  Now, that which cannot become
anything else, whatever it may wish, is mortal, inasmuch as it is
subject to its own nature; but he who can become whatever he wishes,
whenever he wishes, is immortal, returning to a new condition, inasmuch
as he has control over his own nature.  Wherefore much more does the
power of God change the substance of the body into whatever He wishes
and whenever He wishes; and by the change that takes place <span
id="fr_1506"></span>[1507](#fn_1506) He sends forth what, on the one
hand, is of similar substance, but, on the other, is not of equal
power.  Whatever, then, he who sends forth turns into a different
substance, that he can again turn back into his own; <span
id="fr_1507"></span>[1508](#fn_1507) but he who is sent forth, arising
in consequence of the change which proceeds from him, and being his
child, cannot become anything else without the will of him who sent him
forth, unless he wills it.”
