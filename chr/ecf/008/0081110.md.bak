id="vi.iv.xxi.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XV.—</span>[Matthew XI.
25](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#025.md)<span id="vi.iv.xxi.xv-p1.2"></span>
<span class="c1"><span id="vi.iv.xxi.xv-p1.3"></span>Discussed.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxi.xv-p2"></span>And Simon, being vexed at this, said: 
“Blame your own teacher, who said, ‘I thank Thee, Lord of heaven and
earth, that what was concealed from the wise, Thou hast revealed to
suckling babes.’” <span id="fr_1385"></span>[1386](#fn_1385.md)   And Peter
said:  “This is not the way in which the statement was made; but I shall
speak of it as if it had been made in the way that has seemed good to
you.  Our Lord, even if He had made this statement, ‘What was concealed
from the wise, the Father revealed to babes,’ could not even thus be
thought to point out another God and Father in addition to Him who
created the world.  For it is possible that the concealed things of
which He spoke may be those of the Creator (Demiurge) himself; because
Isaiah <span id="fr_1386"></span>[1387](#fn_1386.md) says, ‘I will open my
mouth in parables, and I will belch forth things concealed from the
foundation of the world.’  Do you allow, then, that the prophet was not
ignorant of the things concealed, which Jesus says were concealed from
the wise, but revealed to babes?  And how was the Creator (Demiurge)
ignorant of them, if his prophet Isaiah was not ignorant of them?  But
our Jesus did not in reality say ‘what was concealed,’ but He said what
seems a harsher statement; for He said, ‘*Thou hast concealed these
things from the wise*, and <span id="fr_1387"></span>[1388](#fn_1387.md)
hast revealed them to sucking babes.’  Now the word ‘Thou hast
concealed’ implies that they had once been known to them; for the key of
the kingdom of heaven, that is, the knowledge of the secrets, lay with
them.

but from the Gospel of Matthew ([Matt.
