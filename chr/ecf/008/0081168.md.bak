id="vi.iv.xxiii.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIII.—Peter Goes to
Antioch.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxiii.xxiii-p2"></span>Now, when ten days had passed
away, *there came one of our people* <span
id="fr_1544"></span>[1545](#fn_1544.md) from our father to announce to us
how our father *stood forward* publicly *in the* shape *of Simon*,
accusing him; <span id="fr_1545"></span>[1546](#fn_1545.md) and how by
praising Peter he had made the whole city of Antioch long for him:  and
in consequence of this, all said that they were eager to see him, and
that there were some who were angry with him as being Simon, on account
of their surpassing affection for Peter, and wished to lay hands on
Faustus, believing he was Simon.  Wherefore he, fearing that he might be
put to death, had sent to request Peter to come immediately if he wished
to meet him alive, and to appear at the proper time to the city, when it
was at the height of its longing for him. <span
id="fr_1546"></span>[1547](#fn_1546.md)   Peter, hearing this, called the
multitude together to deliberate, and appointed one of his attendants
bishop; and having remained three days in Laodicea baptizing and
healing, he hastened to the neighboring city of Antioch.  Amen.

<span id="vi.iv.xxiii.xxiii-p5"></span> \[The narrative in the
*Recognitions* (x. 65) is the same up to this point.  But, instead of
this somewhat abrupt conclusion of this chapter, we find there several
chapters (from the close of chap. 65 to the end, chap. 72), which round
out the story:  the confession of the father in his metamorphosis, his
restoration, the Apostle’s entry into Antioch, his miracles there, with
the happy re-union of the entire family of Clement as believers.  It
should be added, as indicating the close relation of the two narratives,
that the closing sentence of the *Homilies* is found, with slight
variations, in *Recognitions*, x. 18.—R.\]
