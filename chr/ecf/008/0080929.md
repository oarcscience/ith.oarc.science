id="vi.iv.xiii.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXII.—Confutation of
Idol-Worship.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xiii.xxii-p2"></span>“In the first place, indeed, if you
worship them as being animated, why do you also worship the sepulchres
of memorable men of old, who confessedly had no divine spirit?  Thus you
do not at all speak truth respecting this.  But if your objects of
worship were really animated, they would move of themselves; they would
have a voice; they would shake off the spiders that are on them; they
would thrust forth those that wish to surprise and to steal them; they
would easily capture those who pilfer the offerings.  But now they do
none of these things, but are guarded, like culprits, and especially the
more costly of them, as we have already said.  But what?  Is it not so,
that the rulers demand of you imposts and taxes on their account, as if
you were greatly benefited by them?  But what?  Have they not often been
taken as plunder by enemies, and been broken and scattered?  And <span
id="page_284">p. 284</span> <span
id="vi.iv.xiii.xxii-Page_284"></span>do not the priests, more than the
outside worshippers, carry off many of the offerings, thus acknowledging
the uselessness of their worship?
