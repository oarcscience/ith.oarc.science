id="vi.iii.iii.lvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter LVII.—Samaritan Refuted.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iii.lvii-p2"></span>“But a certain Samaritan, speaking
against the people and against God, and asserting that neither are the
dead to rise, nor is that worship of God to be maintained which is in
Jerusalem, but that Mount Gerizim is to be reverenced, added also this
in opposition to us, that our Jesus was not He whom Moses foretold as a
Prophet to come into the world.  Against him, and another who supported
him in what he said, James and John, the sons of Zebedee, strove
vigorously; and although they had a command not to enter into their
cities, <span id="fr_587"></span>[588](#fn_587.md) nor to bring the word of
preaching to them, yet, lest their discourse, unless it were confined,
should hurt the faith of others, they replied so prudently and so
powerfully, that they put them to perpetual silence.  For James made an
oration concerning the resurrection of the dead, with the approbation of
all the people; while John showed that if they would abandon the error
of Mount Gerizim, they should consequently acknowledge that Jesus was
indeed He who, according to the prophecy of Moses, was expected to come;
since, indeed, as Moses wrought signs and miracles, so also did Jesus. 
And there is no doubt but that the likeness of the signs proves Him to
be that prophet of whom he said that He should come, ‘like himself.’ 
Having declared these things, and more to the same effect, they ceased.”
