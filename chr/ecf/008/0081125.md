Worse Than the Devil.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxii.vi-p2"></span>And Simon said:  “When you have
discussed all the subjects which I have laid before you, I shall show
you the cause of evil.  Then I shall also reply to what you have now
said, and prove that that God whom you affirm to be blameless is
blameable.”  And Peter said:  “Since I perceive from what you say at the
commencement that you are striving after nothing else than to subject
God, as being the author of evil, to blame, I have resolved to go along
with you all the ways you like, and to prove that God is entirely free
from blame.”  And Simon said:  “You say this as loving God, whom you
suppose you know; but you are not right.”  And Peter said:  “But you, as
being wicked, and hating God whom you have not known, utter blasphemous
words.”  And Simon said:  “Remember that you have likened me to the
author of evil.”  And Peter said:  “I confess it, I was wrong in
comparing you to the evil one; for I was compelled to do so, because I
have not found one who is your equal, or worse than you.  For this
reason I likened you to the evil one; for you happen to be much more
wicked than the author of evil.  For no one can prove that the evil one
spoke against God; but all of us who are present see you speaking
daringly against Him.”  And Simon said:  “He who seeks the truth ought
not to gratify any one in any respect contrary to what is really true. 
For why does he make the inquiry at all?  Why, I ask? for I am not also
able, laying aside the accurate investigation of things, to spend all my
time in the praise of that God whom I do not know.” <span
