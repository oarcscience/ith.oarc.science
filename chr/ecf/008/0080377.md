id="vi.iii.ix.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter X.—Disappearance of His
Father.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.ix.x-p2"></span>“My father hearing this, and confounded
with excessive sorrow, not knowing whither to go or where to seek, went
down with me to the harbour, and began to ask of the sailors whether any
of them had seen or heard of the bodies of a mother and two little
children being cast ashore anywhere, four years ago; when one told one
story and another another, but nothing definite was disclosed to us
searching in this boundless sea.  Yet my father, by reason of the great
affection which he bore to his wife and children, was fed with vain
hopes, until he thought of placing me under guardians and leaving me at
Rome, as I was now twelve years old, and himself going in quest of
them.  Therefore he went down to the harbour weeping, and going on board
a ship, took his departure; and from that time till now I have never
received any letters from him, nor do I know whether he is alive or
dead.  But I rather suspect that he also has perished, either through a
broken heart or by shipwreck; for twenty years have now elapsed since
then, and no tidings of him have ever reached me.”
