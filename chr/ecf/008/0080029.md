<span id="v.iii.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iii.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.—Continuation of the Remarks on
Self-Denial; Object and Reward of True Virgins.</span>

<span id="v.iii.iv-p2"></span>For he who covets for himself these things
*so* great and excellent, withdraws and severs himself on this account
from all the world, that he may go *and* live a life divine and
heavenly, like the holy angels, in work pure and holy, and “in the
holiness <span id="fr_318"></span>[319](#fn_318) of the Spirit of
God,” <span id="fr_319"></span>[320](#fn_319) and that he may serve God
Almighty through Jesus Christ for the sake of the kingdom of heaven.  On
this account he severs himself from all the appetites of the body.  And
not only does he excuse himself from this *command*, “Be fruitful, and
multiply,” but he longs for the “hope promised” and prepared “and laid
up in heaven” <span id="fr_320"></span>[321](#fn_320) by God, who has
declared with His mouth, and He does not lie, that it is “better than
sons and daughters,” <span id="fr_321"></span>[322](#fn_321) and that He
will give to virgins a notable place in the house of God, which is
*something* “better than sons and daughters,” and better than *the place
of* those who have passed a wedded life in sanctity, and whose “bed has
not been defiled.” <span id="fr_322"></span>[323](#fn_322)   For God
will give to virgins the kingdom of heaven, as to the holy angels, by
reason of this great and noble profession.
