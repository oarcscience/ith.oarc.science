<span id="vi.iii.x.lv-p2"></span>To this the old man answered:  “But why
was that prince made who delights in evil? <span
id="fr_825"></span>[826](#fn_825)   And from what was he made?  Or was
he not made?”  Aquila said:  “The treatment of that subject belongs to
another time; but that you may not go away altogether without an answer
to this, I shall give a few hints on this subject also.  God, foreseeing
all things before the creation of the world, knowing that the men who
were to be would some of them indeed incline to good, but others to the
opposite, assigned those who should choose the good to His own
government and His own care, and called them His peculiar
inheritance; <span id="fr_826"></span>[827](#fn_826) but He gave over
the government of those who should turn to evil to those angels who, not
by their substance, but by opposition, were unwilling to remain with
God, being corrupted by the vice of envy and pride.  Those, therefore,
he made worthy princes of worthy subjects; yet he so delivered them over
to those angels, that they have not the power of doing what they will
against them, unless they transgress the bounds assigned to them from
the beginning.  And this is the bound assigned, that unless one first do
the will of the demons, the demons have no power over him.”
