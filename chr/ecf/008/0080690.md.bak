id="vi.iv.vi.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter III.—His Object.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.vi.iii-p2"></span>“When I heard this, how was I not
disheartened!  Wherefore I wished you also, my brethren, who associate
with me, to know that I am beyond measure grieved in my soul, seeing the
wicked one awake for the temptation of men, and men wholly indifferent
about their own salvation.  For to those from amongst the Gentiles who
were about being persuaded respecting the earthly images that they are
no gods, he has contrived to bring in opinions of many other gods, in
order that, if they cease from the polytheo-mania, they may be deceived
to speak otherwise, and even worse *than they now do*, against the sole
government of God, so that they may not yet value the truths connected
with that monarchy, and may never be able to obtain mercy.  And for the
sake of this attempt Simon comes to do battle with us, armed with the
false chapters of the Scriptures.  And what is more dreadful, he is not
afraid to dogmatize thus against the true God from the prophets whom he
does not *in fact* believe.
