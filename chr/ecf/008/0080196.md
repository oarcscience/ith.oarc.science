Father.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iv.lix-p2"></span>Then Simon:  “It is not impious for
the sake of greater profit and advantage to flee to him who is of richer
glory.”  Then Peter:  “If, as you say, it is not impious to flee to a
stranger, it is at all events much more pious to remain with our own
father, even if he be poor.  But if you do not think it impious to leave
our father, and flee to another, as being better than he; and you do not
believe that our Creator will take this amiss; much more the good God
will not be angry, because, when we were strangers to him, we have not
fled to him, but have remained with our own Creator.  Yea, I think he
will rather commend us the more for this, that we have kept faith with
God our Creator; for he will consider that, if we had been his
creatures, we should never have been seduced by the allurements of any
other to forsake him.  For if any one, allured by richer promises, shall
leave his own father and betake himself to a stranger, it may be that he
will leave him in his turn, and go to another who shall promise him
greater things, and this the rather because he is not his son, since he
could leave even him who by nature was his father.”  Then Simon said: 
“But what if souls <span id="page_114">p. 114</span> <span
id="vi.iii.iv.lix-Page_114"></span>are from him, and do not know him,
and he is truly their father?”
