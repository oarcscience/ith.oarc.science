<span id="vi.iv.xix.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.xix.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVI.—The Unbegotten and the
Begotten Necessarily Different from Each Other.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xix.xvi-p2"></span>“In addition to this, it is the
peculiarity of the Father not to have been begotten, but of the Son to
have been begotten; but what is begotten cannot be compared with that
which is unbegotten or self-begotten.”  And Simon said:  “Is it not the
same on account of its origin?” <span
id="fr_1299"></span>[1300](#fn_1299.md)   And Peter said:  “He who is not
the same in all respects as some one, cannot have all the same
appellations applied to him as that person.”  And Simon said:  “This is
to assert, not to prove.”  And Peter said:  “Why, do you not see that
if <span id="fr_1300"></span>[1301](#fn_1300.md) the one happens to be
self-begotten or unbegotten, they cannot be called the same; nor can it
be asserted of him who has been begotten that he is of the same
substance as he is who has begotten him? <span
id="fr_1301"></span>[1302](#fn_1301.md)   Learn this also:  The bodies of
men have immortal souls, which have been clothed with the breath of God;
and having come forth from God, they are of the same substance, but they
are not gods.  But if they are gods, then in this way the souls of all
men, both those who have died, and those who are alive, and those who
shall come into being, are gods.  But if in a spirit of controversy you
maintain that these also are gods, what great matter is it, then, for
Christ to be called God? for He has only what all have.

<span id="vi.iv.xix.xvi-p3"></span> The word <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.xix.xvi-p3.1"></span>γένεσις</span>, “arising, coming into
being,” is here used, not <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.xix.xvi-p3.2"></span>γέννησις</span>, “begetting.”  The idea
fully expressed is:  “Is not that which is begotten identical in essence
with that which begets it?”

<span id="vi.iv.xix.xvi-p4"></span> We have inserted <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.iv.xix.xvi-p4.1"></span>εἰ</span>.  The
passage is amended in various ways; this seems to be the simplest.

<span id="fn_1301"></span>[316:1302](0081068.htm#fr_1301.md) <span
id="vi.iv.xix.xvi-p4.2"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.xix.xvi-p5"></span> \[The very ancient variant in [John
i. 18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018.md)<span
id="vi.iv.xix.xvi-p5.1"></span>, “God only begotten,” indicates the
distinction between the Unbegotten God and the Son.  Even the Arians use
the phrase, “Only-begotten God.”—R.\]
