id="vi.iv.v.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter III.—Forewarned is
Forearmed.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.v.iii-p2"></span>“And let it not be said, Is it not,
then, proper to present comforts and admonitions to those who are in any
bad case?  To this I answer, that if, indeed, any one is able, let him
present them; but if not, let him bide his time.  For I know <span
id="fr_918"></span>[919](#fn_918.md) that all things have their proper
season.  Wherefore it is proper to ply men with words which strengthen
the soul in anticipation of evil; so that, if at any time any evil comes
upon them, the mind, being forearmed with the right argument, may be
able to bear up under that which befalls it:  for then the mind knows in
the crisis of the struggle to have recourse to him who succoured it by
good counsel.
