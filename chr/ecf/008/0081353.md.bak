<span id="vii.xxiii.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vii.xxiii.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 4.</span>

<span id="vii.xxiii.iv-p2"></span>And I Joseph begged the body of Jesus,
and put it in a new tomb, where no one had been put.  And of the robber
on the right the body was not found; but of him on the left, as the form
of a dragon, so was his body.

<span id="vii.xxiii.iv-p3"></span>And after I had begged the body of
Jesus to bury, the Jews, carried away by hatred and rage, shut me up in
prison, where evil-doers were kept under restraint.  And this happened
to me on the evening of the Sabbath, whereby our nation transgressed the
law.  And, behold, that same nation of ours endured fearful tribulations
on the Sabbath.

<span id="vii.xxiii.iv-p4"></span>And now, on the evening of the first
of the week, at the fifth hour of the night, Jesus comes to me in the
prison, along with the robber who had been crucified with Him on the
right, whom He sent into paradise.  And there was a great light in the
building.  And the house was hung up by the four corners, and the place
was opened, and I came out.  Then I first recognised Jesus, and again
the robber, bringing a letter to Jesus.  And as we were going into
Galilee, there shone a great light, which the creation did not produce. 
And there was also with the robber a great fragrance out of paradise.

<span id="vii.xxiii.iv-p5"></span>And Jesus, having sat down in a
certain place, thus read:  We, the cherubim and the six-winged, who have
been ordered by Thy Godhead to watch the garden of paradise, make the
following statement through the robber who was crucified along with
Thee, by Thy arrangement:  When we saw the print of the nails of the
robber crucified along with Thee, and the shining light of the letter of
Thy Godhead, <span id="fr_2044"></span>[2045](#fn_2044.md) the fire indeed
was extinguished, not being able to bear the splendour of the
print; <span id="fr_2045"></span>[2046](#fn_2045.md) and we crouched down,
being in great fear.  For we heard that the Maker of heaven and earth,
and of the whole creation, had come down from on high to dwell in the
lower parts of the earth, on account of Adam, the first created.  And
when we beheld the undefiled cross shining like lightning from the
robber, gleaming with sevenfold the light of the sun, trembling fell
upon us.  We felt a violent shaking of the world below; <span
id="fr_2046"></span>[2047](#fn_2046.md) and with a loud voice, the
ministers of Hades said, along with us:  Holy, holy, holy is He who in
the beginning was in the highest.  And the powers sent up a cry:  O
Lord, Thou hast been made manifest in heaven and in earth, bringing joy
to the world; and, a greater gift than this, Thou hast freed Thine own
image from death by the invisible purpose of the ages.

the fire of the Godhead, we indeed were extinguished.
