Herself and Her Hostess.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xvi.ix-p2"></span>When Faustinus had said this, our
mother fell down at Peter’s feet, begging and entreating him to send for
her and her hostess, and baptize them immediately, in order that, says
she, not a single day may pass after the recovery of my children,
without my taking food with them.  When we united with our mother in
making the same request, Peter said:  “What can you imagine?  Am I alone
heartless, so as not to wish that you should take your meals with your
mother, baptizing her this very day?  But yet it is incumbent on her to
fast one day before she be baptized.  And it is only one day, because,
in her simplicity, she said something in her own behalf, which I looked
on as a sufficient indication of her faith; otherwise, her purification
must have lasted many days.”
