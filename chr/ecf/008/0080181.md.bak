id="vi.iii.iv.xliv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLIV.—The Serpent, the Author of
Polytheism.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iv.xliv-p2"></span>“But even if there be others, as we
have said, who are called gods, they are under the power of the God of
the Jews; for thus saith the Scripture to the Jews, ‘The Lord our God,
He is God of gods, and Lord of lords.’ <span
id="fr_646"></span>[647](#fn_646.md)   Him alone the Scripture also
commands to be worshipped, saying, ‘Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God,
and Him only shalt thou serve;’ <span id="fr_647"></span>[648](#fn_647.md)
and, ‘Hear, O Israel:  the Lord thy God is one God.’ <span
id="fr_648"></span>[649](#fn_648.md)   Yea, also the saints, filled with
the Spirit of God, and bedewed with the drops of His mercy, cried out,
saying, ‘Who is like unto Thee among the gods? O Lord, who is like unto
Thee?’ <span id="fr_649"></span>[650](#fn_649.md)   And again, ‘Who is God,
but the Lord; and who is God, but our Lord?’ <span
id="fr_650"></span>[651](#fn_650.md)   Therefore Moses, when he saw that
the people were advancing, by degrees initiated them in the
understanding of the monarchy and the faith of one God, as he says in
the following words:  ‘Thou shalt not make mention of the names of other
gods;’ <span id="fr_651"></span>[652](#fn_651.md) doubtless remembering
with what penalty the serpent was visited, which had first named
*gods*. <span id="fr_652"></span>[653](#fn_652.md)   For it is condemned to
feed upon dust, and is judged worthy of such food, for this cause, that
it first of all introduced the name of *gods* into the world.  But if
you also wish to introduce many gods, see that you partake not the
serpent’s doom.
