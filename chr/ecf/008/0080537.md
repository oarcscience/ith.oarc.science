<span id="vi.iii.xii.xxix-p2"></span>When Peter had said this, Niceta
answered:  “Do not suppose, my lord Peter, but that the learned men of
the Gentiles have certain plausible arguments, by which they support
those things which seem to be blameworthy and disgraceful.  And this I
state, not as wishing to confirm their error (for far be it from me that
such a thing should ever come into my thought); but yet I know that
there are amongst the more intelligent of them certain defences, by
which they are accustomed to support and colour over those things which
seem to be absurd.  And if it please you that I should state some of
them—for I am to some extent acquainted with them—I shall do as you
order me.”  And when Peter had given him leave, Niceta proceeded as
