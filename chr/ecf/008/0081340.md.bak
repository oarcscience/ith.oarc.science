<span id="vii.xvii.viii-p2"></span>And, behold, suddenly Hades trembled,
and the gates of death and the bolts were shattered, and the iron bars
were broken and fell to the ground, and everything was laid open.  And
Satan remained in the midst, and stood confounded and downcast, bound
with fetters on his feet.  And, behold, the Lord Jesus Christ, coming in
the brightness of light from on high, compassionate, great, and lowly,
carrying a chain in His hand, bound Satan by the neck; and again tying
his hands behind him, dashed him on his back into Tartarus, and placed
His holy foot on his throat, saying:  Through all ages thou hast done
many evils; thou hast not in any wise rested.  To-day I deliver thee to
everlasting fire.  And Hades being suddenly summoned, He commanded him,
and said:  Take this most wicked and impious one, and have him in thy
keeping even to that day in which I shall command thee.  And he, as soon
as he received him, was plunged under the feet of the Lord along with
him into the depth of the abyss.
