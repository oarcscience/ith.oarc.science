<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.xii.ix-p2"></A>Then I answered:&#160; &#8220;Since, therefore, I have to deal with one who is skilled in astrological science,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_858"></A><A HREF="#fn_858"><FONT SIZE="1">859</FONT></A>
 I shall treat the matter with you according to that science, that, taking my method from those things with which you are familiar, you may the more readily acquiesce.&#160; Listen now, therefore:&#160; you confess that those things which we have mentioned are evils, such as fevers, conflagrations, and such like.&#160; Now these, according to you, are said to be produced by malignant stars, such as the humid Saturn and the hot Mars; but things contrary to these are produced by benignant stars, such as the temperate Jupiter and the humid Venus.&#160; Is it not so?&#8221;&#160; My father answered:&#160; &#8220;It is so, my son; and it cannot be otherwise.&#8221;&#160; Then said I:&#160; &#8220;Since you say, therefore, that good things are produced by good stars&#8212;by Jupiter and Venus, for example&#8212;let us see what is the product where any one of the evil stars is mixed with the good, and let us understand that that is evil.&#160; For you lay it down that Venus makes marriages, and if she have Jupiter in her configura<A NAME="page_195"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 195</FONT></A> <a name="vi.iii.xii.ix-Page_195"></A>tion she makes the marriages chaste; but if Jupiter be not regarding, and Mars be present, then you pronounce that the marriages are corrupted by adultery.&#8221;&#160; Then said my father:&#160; &#8220;It is even so.&#8221;&#160; Then I answered:&#160; &#8220;Therefore adultery is an evil, seeing that it is committed through the admixture of evil stars; and, to state it in a word, all things that you say that the good stars suffer from the mixture of evil stars, are undoubtedly to be pronounced to be evil.&#160; Those stars, therefore, by whose admixture we have said that fevers, configurations, and other such like evils are produced,&#8212;those, according to you, work also murders, adulteries, thefts, and also produce haughty and stolid men.&#8221;</p>
