<span id="vi.iii.vi.xxxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iii.vi.xxxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXIV.—Temptation of
Christ.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.vi.xxxiv-p2"></span>“This we would have you know
assuredly, that a demon has no power against a man, unless one
voluntarily submit himself to his desires. <span
id="fr_743"></span>[744](#fn_743.md)   Whence even that one who is the
prince of wickedness, approached Him who, as we have said, is appointed
of God King of peace, tempting Him, and began to promise Him all the
glory of the world; because he knew that when he had offered this to
others, for the sake of deceiving them, they had worshipped him. 
Therefore, impious as he was, and unmindful of himself, which indeed is
the special peculiarity of wickedness, he presumed that he should be
worshipped by Him by whom he knew that he was to be destroyed. 
Therefore our Lord, confirming the worship of one God, answered him: 
‘It is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt
thou serve.’ <span id="fr_744"></span>[745](#fn_744.md)   And he, terrified
by this answer, and fearing lest the true religion of the one and true
God should be restored, hastened straightway to send forth into this
world false prophets, and false apostles, and false teachers, who should
speak indeed in the name of Christ, but should accomplish the will of
the demon.
