id="vi.iv.xiii.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI.—Restoration of the Divine
Image.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xiii.vi-p2"></span>“Therefore approach with confidence
to God, you who at first were made to be rulers and <span
id="page_281">p. 281</span> <span
id="vi.iv.xiii.vi-Page_281"></span>lords of all things:  ye who have His
image in your bodies, have in like manner the likeness of His judgment
in your minds.  Since, then, by acting like irrational animals, you have
lost the soul of man from your soul, becoming like swine, you are the
prey of demons.  If, therefore, you receive the law of God, you become
men.  For it cannot be said to irrational animals, ‘Thou shalt not kill,
thou shalt not commit adultery, thou shalt not steal,’ and so forth. 
Therefore do not refuse, when invited, to return to your first nobility;
for it is possible, if ye be conformed to God by good works.  And being
accounted to be sons by reason of your likeness to Him, you shall be
reinstated as lords of all.
