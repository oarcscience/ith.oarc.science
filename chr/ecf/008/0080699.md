<span id="vi.iv.vi.xii-p2"></span>“But if any one should say that the
foreknowledge *shown* by these predictions is like to that foreknowledge
which is really implanted, he were much deceived.  For he only declares
such things as being present, and that if he speaks truth.  However,
even these things are serviceable to me, for they establish that there
is such a thing as foreknowledge.  But the foreknowledge of the one true
Prophet does not only know things present, but stretches out prophecy
without limit as far as the world to <span id="page_241">p. 241</span>
<span id="vi.iv.vi.xii-Page_241"></span>come, and needs nothing for its
interpretation, not prophesying darkly and ambiguously, so that the
things spoken would need another prophet for the interpretation of them;
but clearly and simply, as our Master and Prophet, by the inborn and
ever-flowing Spirit, always knew all things.
