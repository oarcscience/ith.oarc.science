<span id="vi.iv.xxiii.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.xxiii.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.—Men Sin Through
Ignorance.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxiii.iv-p2"></span>When Peter said this, Micah, who was
himself one of his followers, asked:  “What, then, is the reason why men
sin?”  And Peter said:  “It is because they are ignorant that they will
without doubt be punished for their evil deeds when judgment takes
place. <span id="fr_1489"></span>[1490](#fn_1489.md)   For this reason
they, having lust, as I elsewhere said, for the continuance of life,
gratify it in any accidental way, it may be by the vitiation of
boys, <span id="fr_1490"></span>[1491](#fn_1490.md) or by some other
flattering sin.  For in consequence of their ignorance, as I said
before, they are urged on through fearlessness to satisfy their lust in
an unlawful manner.  Wherefore God is not evil, who has rightly placed
lust within man, that there may be a continuance of life, but they are
most impious who have used the good of lust badly.  The same
considerations apply to anger also, that if one uses it righteously, as
is within his power, he is pious; but going beyond measure, and taking
judgment to himself, <span id="fr_1491"></span>[1492](#fn_1491.md) he is
impious.”

<span id="vi.iv.xxiii.iv-p3"></span> Part of this is supplied by
Dressel’s conjecture.

<span id="vi.iv.xxiii.iv-p4"></span> There is a lacuna, which has been
filled up in various ways.  We have supposed <span class="Greek"><span

class="Greek"><span id="vi.iv.xxiii.iv-p4.2"></span>ἢ</span> <span

<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.iv.xxiii.iv-p4.4"></span>μητέρων
ἤ</span>.  Wieseler supposes “immature boys.”

<span id="fn_1491"></span>[340:1492](0081149.htm#fr_1491.md) <span

<span id="vi.iv.xxiii.iv-p5"></span> Dressel translates, “drawing
judgment on himself.”
