<p class="c21"><a name="v.iv.vii-p2"></A>Let us consider, therefore, my brethren, and see how all the righteous fathers conducted themselves during the whole time of their sojourn in <i>this</i> life, and let us search and examine from the law <i>down</i> to the New Testament.&#160; For this is both becoming and profitable, that we should know how many men there have been, and who <i>they were</i>, that have perished through women; and who and how many have been the women that have perished through men, by reason of the constancy with which they have associated with one another.&#160; And further, also, for the same reason, I will show how many have been the men, and who <i>they were</i>, that lived all their lifetime, and continued even to the close, with one another in <i>the performance of</i> chaste works without blemish.&#160; And it is manifest and well-known that this is so.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_469"></A><A HREF="#fn_469"><FONT SIZE="1">470</FONT></A>
