id="vi.iii.xi.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII.—Astrologers.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.xi.xii-p2"></span>“Therefore the astrologers, <span
id="fr_840"></span>[841](#fn_840.md) being ignorant of such mysteries,
think that these things happen by the courses of the heavenly bodies: 
hence also, in their answers to those who go to them to consult them as
to future things, they are deceived in very many instances.  Nor is it
to be wondered at, for they are not prophets; but, by long practice, the
authors of errors find a sort of refuge in those things by which they
were deceived, and introduce certain <span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iii.xi.xii-p3.1"></span>Climacteric Periods</span>, that they may
pretend a knowledge of uncertain things.  For they represent these <span
class="c9"><span id="vi.iii.xi.xii-p3.2"></span>Climacterics</span> as
times of danger, in which one sometimes is destroyed, sometimes is not
destroyed, not knowing that it is not the course of the stars, but the
operation of demons, that regulates these things; and those demons,
being anxious to confirm the error of astrology, de<span
id="page_186">p. 186</span> <span
id="vi.iii.xi.xii-Page_186"></span>ceive men to sin by mathematical
calculations, so that when they suffer the punishment of sin, either by
the permission of God or by legal sentence, the astrologer may seem to
have spoken truth.  And yet they are deceived even in this; for if men
be quickly turned to repentance, and remember and fear the future
judgment, the punishment of death is remitted to those who are converted
to God by the grace of baptism.
