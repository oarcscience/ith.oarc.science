Discussion.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xvii.xii-p2"></span>When both were silent, I said: 
“Since I know accurately the science, but our lord and our father are
not in this condition, I should like if Annubion himself were here, to
have a discussion with him in the presence of my father.  For thus would
the matter be able to become public, when one practically acquainted
with the subject has held the discussion with one equally
informed.” <span id="fr_1216"></span>[1217](#fn_1216.md)   And our father
answered:  “Where, then, is it possible to fall in with Annubion?”  And
Peter said:  “In Antioch, for I learn that Simon Magus is there, whose
inseparable companion Annubion is.  When, then, we go there, if we come
upon them, the discussion can take place.”  And so, when we had
discussed many subjects, and rejoiced at the recognition and given
thanks to God, evening came down upon us, and we turned to sleep.
