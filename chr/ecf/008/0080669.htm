<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.v.xxxvi-p2"></A>But he (Peter) saw me disheartened, and asked the reason; and being told that it proceeded from no cause but the postponement of <A NAME="page_236"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 236</FONT></A> <a name="vi.iv.v.xxxvi-Page_236"></A>the inquiry,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_943"></A><A HREF="#fn_943"><FONT SIZE="1">944</FONT></A>
