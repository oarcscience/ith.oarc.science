id="vi.iv.xi.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXII.—The Marriage Supper.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xi.xxii-p2"></span>“However, the king of the impious,
striving to bring over to his own counsel the King of the pious, and not
being able, ceased his efforts, undertaking to persecute Him for the
remainder of His life.  But you, being ignorant of the fore-ordained
law, are under his power through evil deeds.  Wherefore you are polluted
in body and soul, and in the present life you are tyrannized over by
sufferings and demons, but in that which is to come you shall have your
souls to be punished.  And this not you alone suffer through ignorance,
but also some of our nation, who by evil deeds having been brought under
the power of the prince of wickedness, like persons invited to a supper
by a father celebrating the marriage of his son, have not obeyed. <span
id="fr_1105"></span>[1106](#fn_1105)   But instead of those who through
preoccupation disobeyed, the Father celebrating the marriage of his Son,
has ordered us, through the Prophet of the truth, to come into the
partings of the ways, that is, to you, and to invest you with the clean
wedding-garment, which is baptism, which is for the remission of the
sins done by you, and to bring the good to the supper of God by
repentance, although at the first they were left out of the banquet.
