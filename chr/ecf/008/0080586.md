id="vi.iv.ii.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter III.—Initiation.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.ii.iii-p2"></span>Therefore, that no such thing may
happen, for this end I have prayed and besought you not to communicate
the books of my preaching which I have sent you to any one, whether of
our own nation or of another nation, before trial; but if any one,
having been tested, has been found worthy, then to hand them over to
him, according to the initiation of Moses, by which he delivered *his
books* to the Seventy who succeeded to his chair; in order that thus
they may keep the faith, and everywhere deliver the rule of truth,
explaining all things after our tradition; lest being themselves dragged
down by ignorance, being drawn into error by conjectures after their
mind, they bring others into the like pit of destruction.  Now the
things that seemed good to me, I have fairly pointed out to you; and
what seems good to you, do you, my lord, becomingly perform.  Farewell.
