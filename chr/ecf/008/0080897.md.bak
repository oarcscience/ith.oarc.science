<span id="vi.iv.xii.xiv-p2"></span>“Therefore shunning and hating us
they are deceived, not knowing how it happens that they devise things
opposed to their health.  For neither can we compel them against their
will to incline towards health, since now we have no such power over
them, nor are they able of themselves to understand the evil instigation
of the demon; for they know not whence these evil instigations are
suggested to them.  And these are they whom the demons affright,
appearing in such forms as they please.  And sometimes they prescribe
remedies for those who are diseased, and thus they receive divine
honours from those who have previously been deceived.  And they conceal
from many that they are demons, but not from us, who know their mystery,
and why <span id="page_278">p. 278</span> <span
id="vi.iv.xii.xiv-Page_278"></span>they do these things, changing
themselves in dreams against those over whom they have power; and why
they terrify some, and give oracular responses to others, and demand
sacrifices from them, and command them to eat with them, that they may
swallow up their souls.
