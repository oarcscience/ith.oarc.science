<span id="vi.iv.vi.xxx-p2"></span>Therefore, standing and seeing all the
people gazing upon him in profound silence, and Simon the magician
standing in the midst, he began to speak thus:  “Peace be to all you who
are in readiness to give your right hands to the truth of God, <span
id="fr_972"></span>[973](#fn_972.md) which, being His great and
incomparable gift in the present world, He who sent us, being an
infallible Prophet of that which is supremely profitable, gave us in
charge, by way of salutation before our words of instruction, to
announce to you, in order that if there be any son of peace among you,
peace may take hold of him through our teaching; but if any of you will
not receive it, then we, shaking off for a testimony the road-dust of
our feet, which we have borne through our toils, and brought to you that
you may be saved, will go to the abodes and the cities of others. <span
