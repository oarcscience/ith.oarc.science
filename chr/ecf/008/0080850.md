id="vi.iv.x.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V.—Peter Departs for Sidon.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.x.v-p2"></span>After Peter had spent a few days in
teaching them in this way, and in healing them, they were baptized.  And
after that, <span id="fr_1081"></span>[1082](#fn_1081) all sat down
together in the market-places in sackcloth and ashes, grieving because
of his other wondrous works, and repenting their former sins.  And <span
id="page_269">p. 269</span> <span id="vi.iv.x.v-Page_269"></span>when
they of Sidon heard it, they did likewise, and sent to beseech Peter,
since they could not come themselves for their diseases.  And Peter did
not spend many days in Tyre; but when he had instructed all its
inhabitants, and freed them from all manners of diseases and had founded
a church, and set over it as bishop one of the elders who were with him,
he departed for Sidon.  But when Simon heard that Peter was coming, he
straightway fled to Beyrout with Appion and his friends.

wondrous deeds, all the rest (who had not been baptized) sat down,” etc.
