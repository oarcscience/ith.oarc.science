<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.iv.ii-p2"></A>Then I, when I heard this, said:&#160; &#8220;You have very well said, O Peter; for one custom is superseded by another.&#160; For when I was at sea, I was at first distressed, and all my system was disordered, so that I felt as if I had been beaten, and could not bear the tossing and tumult of the sea; but after a few days, when I had got accustomed to it, I began to bear it tolerably, so that I was glad to take food immediately in the morning along with the sailors, whereas before it was not my custom to eat anything before the seventh hour.&#160; Now, therefore, simply from the custom which I then acquired, hunger reminds me about that time at which I used to eat with the sailors; which, however, I hope to get rid of, when once another custom shall have been formed.&#160; I believe, therefore, that you also have acquired the habit of wakefulness, as you state; and you have wished at a fitting time to explain this to us, that we also may not grudge to throw off and dispense with some portion of our sleep, that we may be able to take in the precepts of the living doctrine.&#160; For when the food is digested, and the mind is under the influence of the silence of night, those things which are seasonably taught abide in it.&#8221;</p>
