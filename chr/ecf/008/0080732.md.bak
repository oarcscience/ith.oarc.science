id="vi.iv.vi.xlv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLV.—Sacrifices.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.vi.xlv-p2"></span>“But that He is not pleased with
sacrifices, is shown by this, that those who lusted after flesh were
slain as soon as they tasted it, and were consigned to a tomb, so that
it was called the grave of lusts. <span
id="fr_987"></span>[988](#fn_987.md)   He then who at the first was
displeased with the slaughtering of animals, not wishing them to be
slain, did not ordain sacrifices as desiring them; nor from the
beginning did He require them.  For neither are sacrifices accomplished
without the slaughter of animals, nor can the first-fruits be
presented.  But how is it possible for Him to abide in darkness, and
smoke, and storm (for this also is written), who created a pure heaven,
and created the sun to give light to all, and assigned the invariable
order of their revolutions to innumerable stars?  Thus, O Simon, the
handwriting of God—I mean the heaven—shows the counsels of Him who made
it to be pure and stable.
