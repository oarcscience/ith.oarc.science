id="vi.iv.vi.xliii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLIII.—God’s
Foreknowledge.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.vi.xliii-p2"></span>“But if Adam, being the work of God,
had foreknowledge, much more the God who created him.  And that is false
which is written that God reflected, as if using reasoning on account of
ignorance; and that the Lord tempted Abraham, that He might know if he
would endure it; and that which is written, ‘Let us go down, and see if
they are doing according to the cry of them which cometh to me; and if
not, that I may know.’  And, not to extend my discourse too far,
whatever sayings ascribe ignorance to Him, or anything else that is
evil, being upset by other sayings which affirm the contrary, are proved
to be false.  But because He does indeed foreknow, He says to Abraham,
‘Thou shalt assuredly know that thy seed shall be sojourners in a land
that is not their own; and they shall enslave them, and shall evil
entreat them, and humble them four hundred years.  But the nation to
which they shall be in bondage will I judge, and after that they shall
come out hither with much property; but thou shalt depart to thy fathers
with peace, being nourished in a good old age; and in the fourth
generation they shall return hither, for the sins of the Amorites are
hitherto not filled up.’ <span id="fr_986"></span>[987](#fn_986.md)
