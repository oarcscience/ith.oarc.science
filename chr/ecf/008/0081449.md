id="ix.iv-p3.1"></span>A Canticle of Mar <span
id="fr_2938"></span>[2939](#fn_2938.md) Jacob the Teacher on Edessa. <span

<span id="ix.iv-p6"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="ix.iv-p6.1"></span>Edessa</span> sent to Christ by an epistle to
come to her and enlighten her.  On behalf of all the peoples did she
make intercession to Him that He would leave Zion, which hated Him, and
come to the peoples, who loved Him.

<span id="ix.iv-p7"></span>She despatched a messenger to Him, and begged
of Him to enter into friendship with her.  By the righteous king she
made intercession to Him, that He would depart from the *Jewish* people,
and towards the *other* peoples direct His burden.

<span id="ix.iv-p8"></span>From among all kings one wise king did the
daughter of the peoples find.  Ambassador she made him.  To her Lord she
sent by him:  Come Thou unto me; I will forget in Thee all idols and
carved images.

<span id="ix.iv-p9"></span>The harlot heard the report of Him from afar,
as she was standing in the street, going astray with idols, playing the
wench with carved images.  She loved, she much desired Him, when He was
far away, and begged Him to admit her into His chamber.

<span id="ix.iv-p10"></span>Let the much-desired Bridegroom kiss me: 
with the kisses of His mouth let me be blessed.  I have heard of Him
from afar:  may I see Him near; and may I place my lips upon His, and be
delighted by seeing Him with mine eyes.

<span id="ix.iv-p11"></span>Thy breasts are better to me than wine:  for
the fragrance of Thy sweetness is life for evermore.  With Thy milk
shall I be nourished; with Thy fragrance shall I grow sweet from the
smoke of idols, which with its rank odour did make me fetid.

<span id="ix.iv-p12"></span>Draw me after Thee into Thy fold:  for I am
a sheep gone astray in the world.  After Thee do I run, and Thy converse
do I seek:  that in me may be completed that number of a hundred, by
means of a lost one which is found. <span
id="fr_2940"></span>[2941](#fn_2940.md)

<span id="ix.iv-p14"></span>Let Gabriel rejoice and be exceeding glad,
with the company of all the angels, in Thee, the Good Shepherd, who on
Thy shoulders didst carry the maimed sheep, that that number of a
hundred might be preserved.

<span id="ix.iv-p15"></span>Thy love is better than wine; than the face
of the upright Thy affection.  By wine let us be reminded of Thee, how
by the cup of Thy blood Thou didst grant us to obtain new life, and the
upright did celebrate Thy love.

<span id="ix.iv-p16"></span>A church am I from among the peoples, and I
have loved the Only-begotten who was sent *by God:*  whereas His
betrothed hated Him, I have loved Him; and by the hands of Abgar the
Black <span id="fr_2941"></span>[2942](#fn_2941.md) do I beseech Him to
come to me and visit me.

<span id="ix.iv-p18"></span>Black am I, yet comely.  Ye daughters of
Zion, blameless is your envy, seeing that the Son of the Glorious One
hath espoused me, to bring me into His chamber.  Even when I was
hateful, He loved me, for He is able to make me fairer than water.

<span id="ix.iv-p19"></span>Black was I in sins, but I am comely:  for I
have repented and turned me.  I have put away in baptism that hateful
hue, for He hath washed me in His innocent blood who is the Saviour of
all creatures.
