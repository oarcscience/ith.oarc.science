<span id="vii.vi.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vii.vi.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 9.</span>

<span id="vii.vi.ix-p2"></span>And in those days, that is, at the time
of her first coming into Galilee, the angel Gabriel was sent to her by
God, to announce to her the conception of the Lord, and to explain to
her the manner and order of the conception.  Accordingly, going in, he
filled the chamber where she was with a great light; and most
courteously saluting her, he said:  Hail, Mary!  O virgin highly
favoured by the Lord, virgin full of grace, the Lord is with thee;
blessed art thou above all women, blessed above all men that have been
hitherto born. <span id="fr_1699"></span>[1700](#fn_1699)   And the
virgin, who was already well acquainted with angelic faces, and was not
unused to the light from heaven, was neither terrified by the vision of
the angel, nor astonished at the greatness of the light, but only
perplexed by his words; and she began to consider of what nature a
salutation so unusual could be, or what it could portend, or what end it
could have.  And the angel, divinely inspired, taking up this thought,
says:  Fear not, Mary, as if anything contrary to thy chastity were hid
under this salutation.  For in choosing chastity, thou hast found favour
with the Lord; and therefore thou, a virgin, shalt conceive without sin,
and shalt bring forth a son.  He shall be great, because He shall rule
from sea to sea, and from the river even to the ends of the earth; <span
id="fr_1700"></span>[1701](#fn_1700) and He shall be called the Son of
the Most High, because He who is born on earth in humiliation, reigns in
heaven in exaltation; and the Lord God will give Him the throne of His
father David, and He shall reign in the house of Jacob for ever, and of
His kingdom there shall be no end; <span
id="fr_1701"></span>[1702](#fn_1701) forasmuch as He is King of kings
and Lord of lords, <span id="fr_1702"></span>[1703](#fn_1702) and His
throne is from everlasting to everlasting.  The virgin did not doubt
these words of the angel; but wishing to know the manner of it, she
answered:  How can that come to pass?  For while, according to my vow, I
never know man, how can I bring forth without the addition of man’s
seed?  To this the angel says:  Think not, Mary, that thou shalt
conceive in the manner of mankind:  for without any intercourse with
man, thou, a virgin, wilt conceive; thou, a virgin, wilt bring forth;
thou, a virgin, wilt nurse:  for the Holy Spirit shall come upon thee,
and the power of the Most High shall overshadow thee, <span
id="fr_1703"></span>[1704](#fn_1703) without any of the heats of lust;
and therefore that which shall be born of thee shall alone be holy,
because it <span id="page_387">p. 387</span> <span
id="vii.vi.ix-Page_387"></span>alone, being conceived and born without
sin, shall be called the Son of God.  Then Mary stretched forth her
hands, and raised her eyes to heaven, and said:  Behold the hand-maiden
of the Lord, for I am not worthy of the name of lady; let it be to me
according to thy word.

<span id="vii.vi.ix-p8"></span>It will be long, and perhaps to some even
tedious, if we insert in this little work every thing which we read of
as having preceded or followed the Lord’s nativity:  wherefore, omitting
those things which have been more fully written in the Gospel, let us
come to those which are held to be less worthy of being narrated.
