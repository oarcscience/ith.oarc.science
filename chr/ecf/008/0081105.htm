<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xxi.x-p2"></A>And Peter said:&#160; &#8220;Since you have thus spoken to please the multitudes who are present, I shall speak to them, not to please them, but to tell them the truth.&#160; Tell me how you know all those who are present to be worthy, when not even one of them agreed with your exposition of the subject; for the giving of applause to me in opposition to you is not the act of those who agree with you, but of those who agree with me, to whom they gave the applause for having spoken the truth.&#160; But since God, who is just, judges the mind of each one&#8212;a doctrine which you affirm to be true&#8212;He would not have wished this to be given through the left hand to those on the right hand, exactly as the man who receives anything from a robber is himself guilty.&#160; So that, on this account, He did not wish them to receive what is brought by you; but they are to receive the revelation through the Son, who has been set apart for this work.&#160; For to whom is it reasonable that the Father should give a revelation, but to His only Son, because He knows Him to be worthy of such a revelation?&#160; And so this is a matter which one cannot teach or be taught, but it must be revealed by the ineffable hand to him who is worthy to know it.&#8221;</p>
