<span id="vi.iv.vii.vii-p2"></span>And Appion met us, not only with the
two companions just named, but with about thirty other men.  And as soon
as he saw me, he saluted and kissed me, and said, “This is Clement, of
whose noble birth and liberal education I have often told you; for he,
being related to the family of Tiberius Cæsar, and equipped with all
Grecian learning, has been seduced by a certain barbarian called Peter
to speak and act after the manner of the Jews.  Wherefore I beg of you
to strive together with me for the setting of him right.  And in your
presence I now ask him.  Let him tell me, since he thinks that he has
devoted himself to piety, whether he is not acting most impiously, in
forsaking the customs of his country, and falling away to those of the
barbarians.”
