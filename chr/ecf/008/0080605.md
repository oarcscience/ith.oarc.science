id="vi.iv.iii.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVI.—The Bishop’s Labours and
Reward.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.iii.xvi-p2"></span>“But know all of you that the bishop
labours more than you all; because each of you suffers his own
affliction, but he his own and that of every one.  Wherefore, O Clement,
preside as a helper to every one according to your ability, being
careful of the cares of all.  Whence I know that in your undertaking the
administration, I do not confer, but receive, a favour.  But take
courage and bear it generously, as knowing that God will recompense you
when you enter the haven of rest, the greatest of blessings, a reward
that cannot be taken from you, in proportion as you have undertaken more
labour for the safety of all.  So that, if many of the brethren should
hate you on account of your lofty righteousness, their hatred shall
nothing hurt you, but the love of the righteous God shall greatly
benefit you.  Therefore endeavour to shake off the praise that arises
from injustice, and to attain the profitable praise that is from Christ
on account of righteous administration.”
