<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.iii.lxiv-p2"></A>&#8220;&#145;For we,&#146; said I, &#145;have ascertained beyond doubt that God is much rather displeased with the sacrifices which you offer, the time of sacrifices having now passed away; and because ye will not acknowledge that the time for offering victims is now past, therefore the temple shall be destroyed, and the abomination of desolation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_591"></A><A HREF="#fn_591"><FONT SIZE="1">592</FONT></A>
 shall stand in the holy place; and then the Gospel shall be preached to the Gentiles for a testimony against you, that your unbelief may be judged by their faith.&#160; For the whole world at different times suffers under divers maladies, either spreading generally over all, or affecting specially.&#160; Therefore it needs a physician to visit it for its salvation.&#160; We therefore bear witness to you, and declare to you what has been hidden from every one of you.&#160; It is for you to consider what is for your advantage.&#146;&#8221;</p>
