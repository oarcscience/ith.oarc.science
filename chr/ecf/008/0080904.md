id="vi.iv.xii.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXI.—The Demons Subject to the
Believer.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xii.xxi-p2"></span>“For, in like manner as the soldiers
who are put under one of Cæsar’s captains know to honour him who has
received authority on account of him who gave it, so that the commanders
say to this one, Come, and he comes, and to another, Go, and he goes; so
also he who has given himself to God, being faithful, is heard when he
only speaks to demons and diseases; and the demons give place, though
they be much stronger than they who command them.  For with unspeakable
power God subjects the mind of every one to whom He pleases.  For as
many captains, with whole camps and cities, fear Cæsar, who is but a
man, every one’s heart being eager to honour the image of all <span
id="fr_1117"></span>[1118](#fn_1117) for the will of God, all things
being enslaved by fear, do not know the cause; so also all
disease-producing spirits, being awed in some natural way, honour and
flee from him who has had recourse to God, and who carries right faith
as His image in his heart.

<span id="vi.iv.xii.xxi-p3"></span> I prefer here the common text to any
of the proposed emendations, and suppose that the author represents
Cæsar, though but one man, as the image or personification of the whole
empire.
