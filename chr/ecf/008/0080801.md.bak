Amours.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.viii.xiv-p2"></span>“‘In the likeness of a shepherd he
made Mnemosyne mother of the Muses.  Setting himself on fire, he married
Semele, the daughter of Cadmus, of whom he begat Dionysus.  In the
likeness of a dragon he deflowered his daughter Persephone, thought to
be the wife of his brother Pluto.  He had intercourse with many other
women without undergoing any change in his form; for the husbands had no
ill-will to him as if it were a sin, but knew well that in associating
with their wives he bountifully produced children for them, bestowing
upon them the Hermeses, the Apollos, the Dionysi, the Endymions, and
others whom we have spoken of, most excellent in beauty through his
fatherhood.
