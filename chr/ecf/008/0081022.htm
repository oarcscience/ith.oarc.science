&#160; And how will she be chaste, who does not come to the assembly to hear chaste-making words?&#160; And how could she obtain admonition?&#160; And how will she be chaste without watchmen, <A NAME="page_304"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 304</FONT></A> <a name="vi.iv.xvi.xvii-Page_304"></A>if she be not informed in regard to the coming judgement of God, and if she be not fully assured that eternal punishment is the penalty for the slight pleasure?&#160; Wherefore, on the other hand, compel her even against her will always to come to hear the chaste-making word, yea, coax her to do so.</p>
