<span id="vi.iv.xxiii.vi-Page_341"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.xxiii.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI.—God’s Power of Changing
Himself.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxiii.vi-p2"></span>When Peter heard this, he thought
for a little, and said:  “I do not think that any one can converse about
evil without doing the will of the evil one.  Therefore knowing this, I
do not know what I shall do, whether I shall be silent or speak.  For if
I be silent, I should incur the laughter of the multitude, because,
professing to proclaim the truth, I am ignorant of the explanation of
vice.  But if I should state my opinion, I am afraid lest it be not at
all pleasing to God that we should seek after evil, for only seeking
after good is pleasing to Him.  However, in my reply to the statements
of Sophonias, I shall make my ideas more plain.  I then agree with him
in thinking that we ought not to attribute to God all the qualities of
men.  For instance, men not having bodies that are convertible are not
converted; but they have a nature that admits of alteration by the lapse
of time through the seasons of the year.  But this is not the case with
God; for through His inborn <span id="fr_1494"></span>[1495](#fn_1494.md)
Spirit He becomes, by a power which cannot be described, whatever body
He likes.  And one can the more easily believe this, as the air, which
has received such a nature from Him, is converted into dew by the
incorporeal mind permeating it, and being thickened becomes water, and
water being compacted becomes stone and earth, and stones through
collision light up fire.  According to such <span
id="fr_1495"></span>[1496](#fn_1495.md) a change and conversion, air
becomes first water, and ends in being fire through conversions, and the
moist is converted into its natural opposite.  Why?  Did not God convert
the rod of Moses into an animal, making it a serpent, <span
id="fr_1496"></span>[1497](#fn_1496.md) which He reconverted into a rod? 
And by means of this very converted rod he converted the water of the
Nile <span id="fr_1497"></span>[1498](#fn_1497.md) into blood, which again
he reconverted into water.  Yea, even man, who is dust, He changed by
the inbreathing of His breath <span id="fr_1498"></span>[1499](#fn_1498.md)
into flesh, and changed him back again into dust. <span
id="fr_1499"></span>[1500](#fn_1499.md)   And was not Moses, <span
id="fr_1500"></span>[1501](#fn_1500.md) who himself was flesh, converted
into the grandest light, so that the sons of Israel could not look him
in the face?  Much more, then, is God completely able to convert Himself
into whatsoever He wishes.
