id="vi.iv.iv.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter III.—Perplexity.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.iv.iii-p2"></span>From my boyhood, then, being involved
in such reasonings, in order to learn something definite, I used to
resort to the schools of the philosophers.  But nought else did I see
than the setting up and the knocking down of doctrines, and strifes, and
seeking for victory, and the arts of syllogisms, and the skill of
assumptions; and sometimes one *opinion* prevailed,—as, for example,
that the soul is immortal, and sometimes that it is mortal.  If,
therefore, at any time the doctrine prevailed that it is immortal, I was
glad; and when the doctrine prevailed that it is mortal, I was grieved. 
And again, I was the more disheartened because I could not establish
either doctrine to my satisfaction.  However, I perceived that the
opinions on subjects under discussion are taken as true or false,
according to their defenders, and do not appear as they really are. 
Perceiving, therefore, now that the acceptance does not depend on the
real nature of the subjects discussed, but that opinions are proved to
be true or false, according to ability of those who defend them, I was
still more than ever at a loss in regard of things.  Wherefore I groaned
from the depth of my soul.  For neither was I able to establish
anything, nor could I shake off the consideration of such things,
though, as I said before, I wished it.  For although I frequently
charged myself to be at peace, in some way or other thoughts on these
subjects, accompanied with a feeling of pleasure, would come into my
mind.
