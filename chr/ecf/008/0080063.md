Doubts.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iii.i-p5"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iii.iii.i-p5.1"></span>I Clement</span>, who was born in the city
of Rome, <span id="fr_533"></span>[534](#fn_533.md) was from my earliest
age a lover of chastity; while the bent of my mind held me bound as with
chains of anxiety and sorrow.  For a thought that was in me—whence
originating, I cannot tell—constantly led me to think of my condition of
mortality, and to discuss such questions as these:  Whether there be for
me any life after death, or whether I am to be wholly annihilated: 
whether I did not exist before I was born, and whether there shall be no
remembrance of this life after death, and so the boundlessness of time
shall consign all things to oblivion and silence; so that not only we
shall cease to be, but there shall be no remembrance that we have ever
been.  This also I revolved in my mind:  when the world was made, or
what was before it was made, or whether it has existed from eternity. 
For it seemed certain, that if it had been made, it must be doomed to
dissolution; and if it be dissolved, what is to be afterwards?—unless,
perhaps, all things shall be buried in oblivion and silence, or
something shall be, which the mind of man cannot now conceive.
