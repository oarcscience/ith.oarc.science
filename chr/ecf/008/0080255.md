id="vi.iii.v.xlv-p1.1"></span>Chapter LV.—Ten Commandments Corresponding
to the Plagues of Egypt.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.v.xlv-p2"></span>“On account of those, therefore, who
by neglect of their own salvation please the evil one, and those who by
study of their own profit seek to please the good One, ten things have
been prescribed as a test to this present age, according to the number
of the ten plagues which were brought upon Egypt.  For when Moses,
according to the commandment of God, demanded of Pharaoh that he should
let the people go, and in token of his heavenly commission showed signs,
his rod being thrown upon the ground was turned into a serpent. <span
id="fr_702"></span>[703](#fn_702.md)   And when Pharaoh could not by these
means be brought to consent, as having freedom of will, again the
magicians seemed to do similar signs, by permission of God, that the
purpose of the king might be proved from the freedom of his will,
whether he would rather believe the signs wrought by Moses, who was sent
by God, or those which the magicians rather seemed to work than actually
wrought.  For truly he ought to have understood from their very name
that they were not workers of truth, because they were not called
messengers of God, but magicians, as the tradition also intimates. 
Moreover, they seemed to maintain the contest up to a certain point, and
afterwards they confessed of themselves, and yielded to their
superior. <span id="fr_703"></span>[704](#fn_703.md)   Therefore the last
plague is inflicted, <span id="fr_704"></span>[705](#fn_704.md) the de<span

id="vi.iii.v.xlv-Page_129"></span>struction of the first-born, and then
Moses is commanded to consecrate the people by the sprinkling of blood;
and so, gifts being presented, with much entreaty he is asked to depart
with the people.
