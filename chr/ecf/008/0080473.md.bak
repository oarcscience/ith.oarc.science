id="vi.iii.xi.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.—Why the Evil Prince Was
Made.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.xi.iv-p2"></span>But some one will say, How then was it
necessary that that prince should be made, who was to turn away the
minds of men from the true prince? <span
id="fr_835"></span>[836](#fn_835.md)   Because God, who, as I have said,
wished to prepare friends for His Son, did not wish them to be such as
by necessity of nature could not be aught else, but such as should
desire of their own choice and will to be good; because neither is that
praiseworthy which is not desirable, nor is that judged to be good which
is not sought for with purpose.  For there is no credit in being that
from which the necessity of your nature does not admit of your
changing.  Therefore the providence of God has willed that a multitude
of men should be born in this world, that those who should choose a good
life might be selected from many.  And because He foresaw that the
present world could not consist except by variety and inequality, He
gave to each mind freedom of motions, <span
id="fr_836"></span>[837](#fn_836.md) according to the diversities of
present things, and appointed this prince, through his suggestion of
those things which run contrary, that the choice of better things might
depend upon the exercise of virtue.
