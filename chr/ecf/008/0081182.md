<span id="vii.v.v-p2"></span>After these things, her nine months being
fulfilled, Anna brought forth a daughter, and called her Mary.  And
having weaned her in her third year, Joachim, and Anna his wife, went
together to the temple of the Lord to offer sacrifices to God, and
placed the infant, Mary by name, in the community of virgins, in which
the virgins remained day and night praising God.  And when she was put
down before the doors of <span id="page_371">p. 371</span> <span
id="vii.v.v-Page_371"></span>the temple, she went up the fifteen
steps <span id="fr_1627"></span>[1628](#fn_1627.md) so swiftly, that she
did not look back at all; nor did she, as children are wont to do, seek
for her parents.  Whereupon her parents, each of them anxiously seeking
for the child, were both alike astonished, until they found her in the
temple, and the priests of the temple themselves wondered.

Another reading is:  And there were about the temple, according to the
fifteen Psalms of Degrees, fifteen steps of ascent:  the temple was on a
mountain, and there had been there built the altar of burnt-offering,
which could not be reached but by steps.
