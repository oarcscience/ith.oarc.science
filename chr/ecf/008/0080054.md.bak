<span id="v.iv.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XV.—The Example of Jesus; How We May
Allow Ourselves to Be Served by Women.</span>

<span id="v.iv.xv-p2"></span>And, not to extend our discourse to *too*
great length, what shall we say concerning our Lord Jesus Christ?  Our
Lord Himself was constantly with His twelve disciples when He had come
*forth* to the world.  And not only so; but also, when He was sending
them out, He sent them out two and two together, men with men; but women
were not sent with them, and neither in the highway nor in the house did
they associate with women or with maidens:  and thus they pleased God in
everything.  Also, when our Lord Jesus Christ Himself was talking with
the woman of Samaria by the well alone, “His disciples came” and found
Him talking with her, “and wondered that Jesus was standing and talking
with a woman.” <span id="fr_499"></span>[500](#fn_499.md)   Is He not a
rule, such as may not be set aside, an example, and a pattern to all the
tribes of men?  And not only so; but also, when our Lord was risen from
the place of the dead, and Mary came to the place of sepulture, she ran
and fell at the feet of our Lord and worshipped Him, and would have
taken hold of Him.  But He said to her:  “Touch Me not; for I am not yet
ascended to My Father.” <span id="fr_500"></span>[501](#fn_500.md)   Is it
not, then, matter for astonishment, that, while our Lord did not allow
Mary, the blessed woman, to touch His feet, yet *thou* livest with them,
and art waited on by women and maidens, and sleepest where they sleep,
and women wash thy feet for thee, and anoint thee!  Alas for this
culpable state of mind!  Alas for this state of mind which is destitute
of fear!  Alas for this affrontery and folly, which is without fear of
God!  Dost thou not judge thine own self?  Dost thou not examine thine
own self?  Dost thou not know thine own self and the measure of thy
strength?  These things, moreover, are trustworthy, and these things are
true and right; and these are rules immutable for those who behave
themselves uprightly in our Lord.  Many holy women, again, ministered to
holy men of their substance, as the Shunammite woman ministered to
Elisha; but she did not live with him, but the prophet lived in a house
apart.  And, when her son died, she wanted to throw herself at the feet
of the prophet; but his attendant would not allow her, but restrained
her.  But Elisha said to his servant:  “Let her alone, because her soul
is distressed.” <span id="fr_501"></span>[502](#fn_501.md)   From these
things, then, we ought to understand their manner of life.  To Jesus
Christ our Lord women ministered of their substance:  but they did not
live with him; but chastely, and holily, and unblameably they behaved
before the Lord, and finished their course, and received the crown
in <span id="fr_502"></span>[503](#fn_502.md) our Lord God Almighty.
