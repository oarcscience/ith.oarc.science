id="v.iv.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter III.—Rules for the Conduct of Celibate
Brethren in Places Where There are Only Married Christians.</span>

<span id="v.iv.iii-p2"></span>And if again we chance to come into a
place where there is no consecrated brother, but all are married, all
those who are there will receive the brother who comes to them, and
minister to him, and care for his wants <span
id="fr_444"></span>[445](#fn_444.md) in everything, assiduously, with
good-will.  And the brother shall be ministered to by them in the way
that is suit<span id="page_62">p. 62</span> <span
id="v.iv.iii-Page_62"></span>able.  And the brother will say to the
married persons who are in that place:  We holy men do not eat or drink
with women, nor are we waited on by women or by maidens, nor do women
wash our feet for us, nor do women anoint us, nor do women prepare our
bed for us, nor do we sleep where women sleep, so that we may be without
reproach in everything, lest any one should be offended or stumble at
us.  And, whilst we observe all these things, “we are without offence to
every man.” <span id="fr_445"></span>[446](#fn_445.md)   As persons,
therefore, “who know the fear of the Lord, we persuade men, and to God
we are made manifest.” <span id="fr_446"></span>[447](#fn_446.md)
