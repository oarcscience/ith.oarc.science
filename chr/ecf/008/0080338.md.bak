<span id="vi.iii.vii.xxiv-p2"></span>“But to these things the serpent
answers us with another mouth, and says:  If God did not wish these
things to be, then they should not be.  I am not telling you how it is
that many contrary things are permitted to be in this world for the
probation of every one’s mind.  But this is what is suitable to be said
in the meantime:  If, according to you, everything that was to be
worshipped ought not to have been, there would have been almost nothing
in this world.  For what is there that you have left without worshipping
it?  The sun, the moon, the stars, the water, the earth, mountains,
trees, stones, men; there is no one of these that ye have not
worshipped.  According to your saying, therefore, none of these ought to
have been made by God, that you might not have anything that you could
worship!  Yea, He ought not even to have made men themselves to be the
worshippers!  But this is the very thing which that serpent which lurks
within you desires:  for he spares none of you; he would have no one of
you escape from destruction.  But it shall not be so.  For I tell you,
that not that which is worshipped is in fault, but he who worships.  For
with God is righteous judgment; and He judges in one way the sufferer,
and in another way the doer, of wrong.
