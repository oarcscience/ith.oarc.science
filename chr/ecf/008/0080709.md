id="vi.iv.vi.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXII.—Male and Female.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.vi.xxii-p2"></span>“But a companion was created along
with him, a female nature, much differing from him, as quality from
substance, as the moon from the sun, as fire from light.  She, as a
female ruling the present world as her like, <span
id="fr_965"></span>[966](#fn_965.md) was entrusted to be the first
prophetess, announcing prophecy with all amongst those born of
woman. <span id="fr_966"></span>[967](#fn_966.md)   But the other, as the
son of man, being a male, prophesies better things to the world to come
as a male.

<span id="vi.iv.vi.xxii-p3"></span> That is, the present world is
female, and is under the rule of the female; the world to come is male,
and is under the rule of the male.

<span id="vi.iv.vi.xxii-p4"></span> The allusion is to the fact that
John the Baptist is called the greatest of those born of woman, while
Christ is called the Son of man.
