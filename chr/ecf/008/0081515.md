<span id="x.vi.i-p3"></span>\[<span class="c9"><span
id="x.vi.i-p3.1"></span>a.d.</span> 170.\]  One of the sub-Apostolic
age, a contemporary of Justin and of the martyrs of “the good Aurelius,”
we must yet distinguish Hegesippus <span
id="fr_3691"></span>[3692](#fn_3691.md) from the apologists.  He is the
earliest of the Church’s chroniclers—we can hardly call him a
historian.  His aims were noble and his character was pure; nor can we
refuse him the credit due to a foresight of the Church’s ultimate want
of historical material, which he endeavoured to supply.

<span id="x.vi.i-p5"></span>What is commonly regarded as his defect is
in reality one of his greatest merits as a witness:  he was a Hebrew,
and looks at the Church from the stand-point of “James the Lord’s
brother.”  When we observe his Catholic spirit, therefore, as well as
his Catholic orthodoxy; his sympathy with the Gentile Church and Pauline
faith of the Corinthians; his abhorrence of “the Circumcision” so far as
it bred sects and heresies against Christ; and when we find him
confirming the testimony of the Apostolic Fathers, and sustaining the
traditions of Antioch by those of Jerusalem,—we have double reason to
cherish his name, and to treasure up “the fragments that remain” of his
works.  That touching episode of the kindred of Christ, as they appeared
before Domitian, has always impressed my imagination as worthy to be
classed with the story of St. John and the robber, as one of the most
suggestive incidents of early Christian history.  We must lament the
loss of other portions of the *Memoirs* which were known to exist in the
seventeenth century.  He was a traveller, and must have seen much of the
Apostolic churches in the East and West; and the mere scraps we have of
his narrative concerning Corinth and Rome excite a natural curiosity as
to the rest, which may lead to gratifying discoveries.
