<span id="vi.iii.xi.xxxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iii.xi.xxxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXIV.—The Other Side of the
Story.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.xi.xxxiv-p2"></span>Then I Clement, understanding that
he perchance was my father, was drowned in tears, and my brothers also
were ready to rush forward and to disclose the matter; but Peter
restrained them, saying:  “Be quiet, until I give you permission.” 
Therefore Peter, answering, said to the old man:  “What was the name of
your younger son?”  And he said:  “Clement.”  Then Peter:  “If I shall
this day restore to you your most chaste wife and your three sons, will
you believe that a modest mind can overcome unreasonable impulses, and
that all things that have been spoken by us are true, and that <span
class="c9"><span id="vi.iii.xi.xxxiv-p2.1"></span>Genesis</span> is
nothing?”  Then said the old man:  “As <span id="page_191">p. 191</span>
<span id="vi.iii.xi.xxxiv-Page_191"></span>it is impossible for you to
perform what you have promised, so it is impossible that anything can
take place apart from <span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iii.xi.xxxiv-p2.2"></span>Genesis</span>.”  Then says Peter:  “I
wish to have all who are here present as witnesses that I shall this day
hand over to you your wife, who is living most chastely, with your three
sons.  And now take a token of these things from this, that I know the
whole story much more accurately than you do; and I shall relate the
whole occurrences in order, both that you may know them, and that those
who are present may learn.”
