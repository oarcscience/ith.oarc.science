the Bite of a Serpent.</span>

<span id="vii.x.xiv-p2"></span>And Joseph sent James to gather straw,
and Jesus followed him.  And while James was gathering the straw, a
viper bit him; and he fell to the ground, as if dead from the poison. 
And Jesus seeing this, blew upon his wound; and immediately James was
made whole, and the viper died.
