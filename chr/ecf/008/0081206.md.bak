<span id="vii.v.xxix-p2"></span>And again the son of Annas, a priest of
the temple, who had come with Joseph, holding his rod in his hand in the
sight of all, with great fury broke down the dams which Jesus had made
with His own hands, and let out the water which He had collected in them
from the torrent.  Moreover, he shut the aqueduct by which the water
came in, and then broke it down.  And when Jesus saw this, He said to
that boy who had destroyed His dams:  O most wicked seed of iniquity!  O
son of death!  O workshop of Satan! verily the fruit of thy seed shall
be without strength, and thy roots without moisture, and thy branches
withered, bearing no fruit.  And immediately, in the sight of all, the
boy withered away, and died.
