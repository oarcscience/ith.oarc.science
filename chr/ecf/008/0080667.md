id="vi.iv.v.xxxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXIV.—Useless and Philanthropic
Miracles.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.v.xxxiv-p2"></span>“Those, then, are useless signs,
which you say that Simon did.  But I say that the making statues walk,
and rolling himself on burning coals, and becoming a dragon, and being
changed into a goat, and flying in the air, and all such things, not
being for the healing of man, are of a nature to deceive many.  But the
miracles of compassionate truth are philanthropic, such as you have
heard that the Lord did, and that I after Him accomplish by my prayers;
at which most of you have been present, some being freed from all kinds
of diseases, and some from demons, some having their hands restored, and
some their feet, some recovering their eyesight, and some their hearing,
and whatever else a man can do, being of a philanthropic spirit.”
