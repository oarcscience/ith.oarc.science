id="vi.iii.xii.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter III.—A Suggestion.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.xii.iii-p2"></span>And when we had commended his right
counsel, I Clement said:  “In all things, the end for the most part
looks back upon the beginning, and the issue of things is similar to
their commencement.  I hope, therefore, with respect to our father also,
since God by your means has given a good beginning, that He will bestow
also an ending suitable to the beginning, and worthy of Himself. 
However, I make this suggestion, that if, as you have said, we begin to
speak, in presence of my father, as if for the purpose of discussing
some subject, or learning something from one another, you, my lord
Peter, ought not to occupy the place of one who has anything to learn;
for if he see this, he will rather be offended.  For he is convinced
that you fully know all things, as indeed you do.  How then will it be,
if he see you pretending ignorance?  This, as I have said, will rather
hurt him, being ignorant of your design.  But if we brothers, while we
converse among ourselves, are in any doubt, let a fitting solution be
given by you to our inquiry.  For if he see even you hesitating and
doubting, then truly he will think that no one has knowledge of the
truth.”
