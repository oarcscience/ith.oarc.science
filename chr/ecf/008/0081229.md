<span id="vii.vi.viii-p2"></span>Now there was among the rest Joseph, of
the house and family of David, a man of great age:  and when all brought
there rods, according to the order, he alone withheld his.  Wherefore,
when nothing in conformity with the divine voice appeared, the high
priest thought it necessary to consult God a second time; and He
answered, that of those who had been designated, he alone to whom the
virgin ought to be espoused had not brought his rod.  Joseph, therefore,
was found out.  For when he had brought his rod, and the dove came from
heaven; and settled upon the top of it, it clearly appeared to all that
he was the man to whom the virgin should be espoused.  Therefore, the
usual ceremonies of betrothal having been gone through, he went back to
the city of Bethlehem to put his house in order, and to procure things
necessary for the marriage.  But Mary, the virgin of the Lord, with
seven other virgins of her own age, and who had been weaned at the same
time, whom she had received from the priest, returned to the house of
her parents in Galilee.
