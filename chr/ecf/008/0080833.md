<span id="vi.iv.ix.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.ix.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XV.—The Judgment of Paris.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.ix.xv-p2"></span>“Then Hera, and Athena, and Aphrodite,
and Eris, and the apple, and Hermes, and the judgment, and the shepherd,
have some such hidden meaning as the following:—Hera is dignity; Athena,
manliness; Aphrodite, pleasure; Hermes, language, which interprets
(<span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iv.ix.xv-p2.1"></span>hermeneutikos</span>) thought; the shepherd
Paris, unreasoned and brutish passion.  Now if, in the prime of life,
reason, that shepherd of the soul, is brutish, does not regard its own
advantage, will have nothing to do with manliness and temperance,
chooses only pleasure, and gives the prize to lust alone, bargaining
that it is to receive in return from lust what may delight it,—he who
thus judges incorrectly will choose pleasure to his own destruction and
that of his friends.  And Eris is jealous spite; and the golden apples
of the Hesperides are perhaps riches, by which occasionally even
temperate persons like Hera are seduced, and manly ones like Athena are
made jealous, so that they do things which do not become them, and the
soul’s beauty like Aphrodite is destroyed under the guise of
refinement.  To speak briefly, in all men riches provoke evil discord.
