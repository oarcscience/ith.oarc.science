id="vi.iv.v.xxx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXX.—An Argument.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.v.xxx-p2"></span>“Then Simon said:  ‘I am aware that you
know that I separated a soul from a human body; but I know that you are
ignorant that it is not the soul of the dead person that ministers to
me, for it does not exist; but a certain demon works, pretending to be
the soul.’  Then said Nicetas:  ‘Many incredible things we have heard in
our lifetime, but aught more senseless than this speech we do not expect
ever to hear.  For if a demon pretends to be the soul of the dead
person, what is the use of the soul at all, that it should be separated
from the body?  Were not we ourselves present and heard you conjuring
the soul from the body?  And how comes it that, when one is conjured,
another who is not conjured obeys, as if it were frightened?  And you
yourself, when at any time we have asked you why the conferences
sometimes cease, did not you say that the soul, having fulfilled the
time upon earth which it was to have passed in the body, goes to Hades? 
And you added, that <span id="page_235">p. 235</span> <span
id="vi.iv.v.xxx-Page_235"></span>the souls of those who commit suicide
are not easily permitted to come, because, having gone home into Hades,
they are guarded.’”
