<span id="vi.iv.xix.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.xix.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.—The Prejudices of Faustus
Rather on the Side of Simon Than on that of Peter.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xix.iv-p2"></span>Our father answered:  “Do not compel
me to agree with you without any exercise of my judgment in order that I
may seem to be a <span id="page_313">p. 313</span> <span
id="vi.iv.xix.iv-Page_313"></span>truth-loving judge; but if you wish me
to tell you the truth, my prepossessions are rather the side of your
opinions.”  And Simon said:  “How is this the case, when you do not know
what my opinions are?”  And our father said:  “It is easy to know this,
and I will tell you how.  You promised that you would convict Peter of
error in maintaining the unity of God; but if one undertakes to convict
of error him who maintains the unity of God. it is perfectly plain that
he, as being in the right, <span id="fr_1252"></span>[1253](#fn_1252.md)
does not hold the same opinion.  For if he holds the same opinion as the
man who is thoroughly in error, then he himself is in error; but if he
gives his proofs holding opposite opinions, then he is in the right.
 Not well <span id="fr_1253"></span>[1254](#fn_1253.md) then do you assert
that he who maintains the unity of God is wrong, unless you believe that
there are many gods.  Now I maintain that there are many gods.  Holding,
therefore, the same opinion as you before the discussion, I am
prepossessed rather in your favour.  For this reason you ought to have
no anxiety in regard to me, but Peter ought, for I still hold opinions
contrary to his.  And so after your discussion I hope that, as a
truth-loving judge, who has stripped himself of his prepossessions, I
shall agree to that doctrine which gains the victor.”  When my father
said this, a murmur of applause burst insensibly from the multitudes
because my father had thus spoken.
