<span id="vii.xii.xvii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vii.xii.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 16.</span>

<span id="vii.xii.xvii-p2"></span>And the rulers of the synagogue, and
the priests and the Levites, when they heard these words from Joseph,
became as dead, and fell to the ground, and fasted until the ninth
hour.  And Nicodemus, along with Joseph, exhorted Annas and Caiaphas,
the priests and the Levites, saying:  Rise up and stand upon your feet,
and taste bread, and strengthen your souls, because to-morrow is the
Sabbath of the Lord.  And they rose up, and prayed to God, and ate and
drank, and departed every man to his own house.

<span id="vii.xii.xvii-p3"></span>And on the Sabbath our teachers and
the priests and Levites sat questioning each other, and saying:  What is
this wrath that has come upon us? for we know his father and mother. 
Levi, a teacher, says:  I know that his parents fear God, and do not
withdraw themselves from the prayers, and give the tithes thrice a
year. <span id="fr_1852"></span>[1853](#fn_1852.md)   And when Jesus was
born, his parents brought him to this place, and gave sacrifices and
burnt-offerings to God.  And when the great teacher Symeon took him into
his arms, he said, Now Thou sendest away Thy servant, Lord, according to
Thy word, in peace; for mine eyes have seen Thy salvation, which Thou
hast prepared before the face of all the peoples:  a light for the
revelation of the Gentiles, and the glory of Thy people Israel.  And
Symeon blessed them, and said to Mary his mother, I give thee good news
about this child.  And Mary said, It is well, my lord.  And Symeon said
to her, It is well; behold, he lies for the fall and rising again of
many in Israel, and for a sign spoken against; and of thee thyself a
sword shall go through the soul, in order that the reasoning of many
hearts may be revealed. <span id="fr_1853"></span>[1854](#fn_1853.md)

<span id="vii.xii.xvii-p6"></span>They say to the teacher Levi:  How
knowest thou these things?  Levi says to them:  Do you not know that
from him I learned the law?  The Sanhedrin say to him:  We wish to see
thy father.  And they sent for his father.  And they asked him; and he
said to them:  Why have you not believed my son?  The blessed and just
Symeon himself taught him the law.  The Sanhedrin says to Rabbi Levi: 
Is the word that you have said true?  And he said:  It is true.  And the
rulers of the synagogue, and the priests and the Levites, said to
themselves:  Come, let us send into Galilee to the three men that came
and told about his teaching and his taking up, and let them tell us how
they saw him taken up.  And this saying pleased all.  And they sent away
the three men who had already gone away into Galilee with them; and they
say to them:  Say to Rabbi Adas, and Rabbi Phinees, and Rabbi Haggai: 
Peace to you, and all who are with you!  A great inquiry having taken
place in the Sanhedrin, we have been sent to you to call you to this
holy place, Jerusalem.

<span id="vii.xii.xvii-p7"></span>And the men set out into Galilee, and
found them sitting and considering the law; and they saluted them in
peace.  And the men who were in Galilee said to those who had come to
them:  Peace upon all Israel!  And they said:  Peace to you!  And they
again said to them:  Why have you come?  And those who had been sent
said:  The Sanhedrin call you to the holy city Jerusalem.  And when the
men heard that they were sought by the Sanhedrin, they prayed to God,
and reclined with the men, and ate and drank, and rose up, and set out
in peace to Jerusalem.

<span id="vii.xii.xvii-p8"></span>And on the following day the Sanhedrin
sat in the synagogue, and asked them, saying:  Did <span
id="page_425">p. 425</span> <span id="vii.xii.xvii-Page_425"></span>you
really see Jesus sitting on the mountain Mamilch teaching his eleven
disciples, and did you see him taken up?  And the men answered them, and
said:  As we saw him taken up, so also we said.

<span id="vii.xii.xvii-p9"></span>Annas says:  Take them away from one
another, and let us see whether their account agrees.  And they took
them away from one another.  And first they call Adas, and say to him: 
How didst thou see Jesus taken up?  Adas says:  While he was yet sitting
on the mountain Mamilch, and teaching his disciples, we saw a cloud
overshadowing both him and his disciples.  And the cloud took him up
into heaven, and his disciples lay upon their face upon the earth.  And
they call Phinees the priest, and ask him also, saying:  How didst thou
see Jesus taken up?  And he spoke in like manner.  And they again asked
Haggai, and he spoke in like manner.  And the Sanhedrin said:  The law
of Moses holds:  At the mouth of two or three every word shall be
established. <span id="fr_1854"></span>[1855](#fn_1854.md)   Buthem, a
teacher, says:  It is written in the law, And Enoch walked with God, and
is not, because God took him. <span id="fr_1855"></span>[1856](#fn_1855.md)
  Jairus, a teacher, said:  And the death of holy Moses we have heard
of, and have not seen it; for it is written in the law of the Lord, And
Moses died from the mouth of the Lord, and no man knoweth of his
sepulchre unto this day. <span id="fr_1856"></span>[1857](#fn_1856.md)  
And Rabbi Levi said:  Why did Rabbi Symeon say, when he saw Jesus,
“Behold, he lies for the fall and rising again of many in Israel, and
for a sign spoken against?” <span id="fr_1857"></span>[1858](#fn_1857.md)  
And Rabbi Isaac said:  It is written in the law, Behold, I send my
messenger before thy face, who shall go before thee to keep thee in
every good way, because my name has been called upon him. <span
id="fr_1858"></span>[1859](#fn_1858.md)

<span id="vii.xii.xvii-p15"></span>Then Annas and Caiaphas said: 
Rightly have you said what is written in the law of Moses, that no one
saw the death of Enoch, and no one has named the death of Moses; but
Jesus was tried before Pilate, and we saw him receiving blows and
spittings on his face, and the soldiers put about him a crown of thorns,
and he was scourged, and received sentence from Pilate, and was
crucified upon the Cranium, and two robbers with him; and they gave him
to drink vinegar with gall, and Longinus the soldier pierced his side
with a spear; and Joseph our honourable father begged his body, and, as
he says, he is risen; and as the three teachers say, We saw him taken up
into heaven; and Rabbi Levi has given evidence of what was said by Rabbi
Symeon, and that he said, Behold, he lies for the fall *and* rising
again of many in Israel, and for a sign spoken against.  And all the
teachers said to all the people of the Lord:  If this was from the Lord,
and is wonderful in your eyes, <span
id="fr_1859"></span>[1860](#fn_1859.md) knowing you shall know, O house of
Jacob, that it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth upon a
tree. <span id="fr_1860"></span>[1861](#fn_1860.md)   And another Scripture
teaches:  The gods which have not made the heaven and the earth shall be
destroyed. <span id="fr_1861"></span>[1862](#fn_1861.md)   And the priests
and the Levites said to each other:  If his memorial be until the *year*
that is called Jobel, <span id="fr_1862"></span>[1863](#fn_1862.md) know
that it shall it endure for ever, and he hath raised for himself a new
people.  Then the rulers of the synagogue, and the priests and the
Levites, announced to all Israel, saying:  Cursed is that man who shall
worship the work of man’s hand, and cursed is the man who shall worship
the creatures more than the Creator.  And all the people said, Amen,
amen. <span id="fr_1863"></span>[1864](#fn_1863.md)

<span id="vii.xii.xvii-p21"></span>And all the people praised <span
id="fr_1864"></span>[1865](#fn_1864.md) the Lord, and said:  Blessed is the
Lord, who hath given rest to His people Israel, according to all that He
hath spoken; there hath not fallen one word of every good word of His
that He spoke to Moses His servant.  May the Lord our God be with us, as
He was with our fathers:  let Him not destroy us.  And let Him not
destroy us, that we may incline our hearts to Him, that we may walk in
all His ways, that we may keep His commandments and His judgments which
He commanded to our fathers. <span id="fr_1865"></span>[1866](#fn_1865.md)
  And the Lord shall be for a king over all the earth in that day; and
there shall be one Lord, and His name one. <span
id="fr_1866"></span>[1867](#fn_1866.md)   The Lord is our king:  He shall
save us. <span id="fr_1867"></span>[1868](#fn_1867.md)   There is none like
Thee, O Lord. <span id="fr_1868"></span>[1869](#fn_1868.md)   Great art
Thou, O Lord, and great is Thy name.  By Thy power heal us, O Lord, and
we shall be healed:  save us, O Lord, and we shall be saved; <span
id="fr_1869"></span>[1870](#fn_1869.md) because we are Thy lot and
heritage.  And the Lord will not leave His people, for His great name’s
sake; for the Lord has begun to make us into His people. <span
id="fr_1870"></span>[1871](#fn_1870.md)

<span id="vii.xii.xvii-p29"></span>And all, having sung praises, went
away each man to his own house, glorifying God; for His is the glory for
ever and ever.  Amen.
