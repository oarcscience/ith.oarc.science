<span id="vi.iv.xvi.xix-p2"></span>“God is my witness:  one adultery is
as bad as many murders; and what is terrible in it is this, that the
fearfulness and impiety of its murders are not seen.  For, when blood is
shed, the dead body remains lying, and all are struck by the terrible
nature of the occurrence.  But the murders of the soul caused by
adultery, though they are more frightful, yet, since they are not seen
by men, do not make the daring a whit less eager in their impulse. 
Know, O man, whose breath it is that thou hast to keep thee in life, and
thou shalt not wish that it be polluted.  By adultery alone is the
breath of God polluted.  And therefore it drags him who has polluted it
into the fire; for it hastens to deliver up its insulter to everlasting
punishment.”
