id="vi.iv.xxi.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II.—Definition of Goodness and
Justice.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxi.ii-p2"></span>And Peter said:  “That I may not waste
my time in contentious discussions, while I make the fair demand that
you should give answers to my propositions, I shall myself answer those
questions which I put, as is your wish.  I then affirm that the man who
bestows <span id="fr_1370"></span>[1371](#fn_1370.md) *goods* is good, just
as I see the Framer of the world doing when He gives the sun to the
good, and the rain to the just and unjust.”  And Simon said:  “It is
most unjust that he should give the same things to the just and the
unjust.”  And Peter said:  “Do you, then, in your turn state to us what
course of conduct would constitute Him good.”  And Simon said:  “It is
you that must state this.”  And Peter said:  “I will.  He who gives the
same things to the good and just, and also to the evil and unjust, is
not even just according to you; but you would with reason call Him just
if He gave goods to the good and evils to the evil.  What course of
conduct, then, would He adopt, if He does not adopt the plan of giving
things temporal to the evil, if perchance they should be converted, and
things eternal to the good, if at least they remain *good?*  And thus by
giving to all, but by gratifying the more <span id="page_325">p.
325</span> <span id="vi.iv.xxi.ii-Page_325"></span>excellent, <span
id="fr_1371"></span>[1372](#fn_1371.md) His justice is good; and all the
more long-suffering in this, that to sinners who repent He freely grants
forgiveness of their sins, and to those who have acted well He assigns
even eternal life.  But judging at last, and giving to each one what he
deserves, He is just.  If, then, this is right, confess it; but if it
appears to you not to be right, refute it.”

<span id="vi.iv.xxi.ii-p3"></span> There is a lacuna in one of the <span
class="c9"><span id="vi.iv.xxi.ii-p3.1"></span>mss.</span> here, which
is supplied in various ways.  We have inserted the word “goods.”

<span id="fn_1371"></span>[325:1372](0081097.htm#fr_1371.md) <span
id="vi.iv.xxi.ii-p3.2"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxi.ii-p4"></span> This translation of Cotelerius is
doubtful.  More correctly it would be, “by gratifying different people,”
which does not make sense.  Wieseler proposes, “by gratifying in
different ways.”
