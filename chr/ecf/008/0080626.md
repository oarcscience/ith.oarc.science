<span id="vi.iv.iv.xvi-p2"></span>Then the blessed man, springing
forward as soon as he heard my name, kissed me; and making me sit down,
straightway said, “You acted nobly in entertaining Barnabas, a herald of
the truth, to the honour of the living God, being magnanimously not
ashamed, nor fearing the resentment of the rude multitude.  Blessed
shall you be.  For as you thus with all honour entertained the
ambassador of the truth, so also truth herself shall constitute you, who
are a stranger, a citizen of her own city.  And thus you shall greatly
rejoice, because you have now lent a small favour; I mean the kindness
of good words.  You shall be heir of blessings which are both eternal
and cannot possibly be taken from you.  And do not trouble yourself to
detail to me your manner of life; for the veracious Barnabas has
detailed to us everything relating to you, making favourable mention of
you almost every day.  And in order that I may tell to you briefly, as
to a genuine friend, what is in hand, travel with us, unless anything
hinders you, partaking of the words of truth which I am going to speak
from city to city, as far as Rome itself.  And if you wish *to say*
anything, speak on.”
