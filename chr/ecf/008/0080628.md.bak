id="vi.iv.iv.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.—Causes of
Ignorance.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xviii-p2"></span>“The will of God has been *kept* in
obscurity in many ways.  In the first place, there is evil instruction,
wicked association, terrible society, unseemly discourses, wrongful
prejudice.  Thereby is error, then fearlessness, unbelief, fornication,
covetousness, vainglory; and ten thousand other such evils, filling the
world as a quantity of smoke fills a house, have obscured the sight of
the men inhabiting the world, and have not suffered them to look up and
become acquainted with God the Creator from the delineation *of Himself
which He has given*, and to know what is pleasing to Him.  Wherefore it
behoves the lovers of truth, crying out inwardly from their breasts, to
call for aid, with truth-loving reason, that some one living within the
house <span id="fr_912"></span>[913](#fn_912.md) which is filled with smoke
may approach and open the door, so that the light of the sun which is
without may be admitted into the house, and the smoke of the fire which
is within may be driven out.

without the house,” seems preferable.
