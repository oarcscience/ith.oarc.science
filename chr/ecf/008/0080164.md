Answers.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iv.xxvii-p2"></span>Then Peter:  “Neither He who sent
me did amiss in sending a sword upon the earth, nor do I act contrary to
Him in asking peace of the hearers.  But you both unskilfully and rashly
find fault with what you do not understand:  for you have heard that the
Master came not to send peace on earth; but that He also said, ‘Blessed
are the peace-makers, for they shall be called the very sons of
God,’ <span id="fr_619"></span>[620](#fn_619) you have not heard. 
Wherefore my sentiments are not different from those of the Master when
I recommend peace, to the keepers of which He assigned blessedness.” 
Then Simon said:  “In your desire to answer for your Master, O Peter,
you have brought a much more serious charge against him, if he himself
came not to make peace, yet enjoined upon others to keep it.  Where,
then, is the consistency of that other saying of his, ‘it is enough for
the disciple that he be as his master?’” <span
