<p class="c35"><a name="vi.iv.xx.xviii-p1"></A> <span class="c1"><a name="vi.iv.xx.xviii-p1.1"></A>Chapter XVIII.&#8212;The Nature of Revelation.</span></p> 
<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xx.xviii-p2"></A>&#8220;Thus to me also was the Son revealed by the Father.&#160; Wherefore I know what is the meaning of revelation, having learned it in my own case.&#160; For at the very time when the Lord said, &#145;Who do they say that I am?&#146;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1359"></A><A HREF="#fn_1359"><FONT SIZE="1">1360</FONT></A>
 and when I heard one saying one thing of Him, and another another, it came into my heart to say (and I know not, therefore, how I said it), &#145;Thou art the Son of the living God.&#146;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1360"></A><A HREF="#fn_1360"><FONT SIZE="1">1361</FONT></A>
&#160; But He, pronouncing me blessed, pointed out to me that it was the Father who had revealed it to me; and from this time I learned that revelation is knowledge gained without instruction, and without apparition and dreams.&#160; And this is indeed the case.&#160; For in the <i>soul</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1361"></A><A HREF="#fn_1361"><FONT SIZE="1">1362</FONT></A>
 which has been placed in us by&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1362"></A><A HREF="#fn_1362"><FONT SIZE="1">1363</FONT></A>
 God, there is all the truth; but it is covered and revealed by the hand of God, who works so far as each one through his knowledge deserves.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1363"></A><A HREF="#fn_1363"><FONT SIZE="1">1364</FONT></A>
&#160; But the declaration of anything by means of apparitions and dreams from without is a proof, not that it comes from revelation, but from wrath.&#160; Finally, then, it is written in the law, that God, being angry, said to Aaron and Miriam,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1364"></A><A HREF="#fn_1364"><FONT SIZE="1">1365</FONT></A>
 &#145;If a prophet arise from amongst you, I shall make myself known to him through visions and dreams, but not so as to my servant Moses; because I shall speak to him in an <i>outward</i> appearance, and not through dreams, just as one will speak to his own friend.&#146;&#160; You see how the statements of wrath are made through visions and dreams, but the statements to a friend are made face to face, in <i>outward</i> appearance, and not through riddles and visions and dreams, as to an enemy.</p>
