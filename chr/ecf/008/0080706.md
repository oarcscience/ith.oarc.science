id="vi.iv.vi.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIX.—Reign of Christ.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.vi.xix-p2"></span>“On this account, I say, He Himself,
rising from His seat as a father for his children, proclaiming the
things which from the beginning were delivered in secret to the worthy,
extending mercy even to the Gentiles, and compassionating the souls of
all, neglected His own kindred.  For He, being thought worthy to be King
of the world to come, *fights against* <span
id="fr_961"></span>[962](#fn_961.md) him who, by predestination, has
usurped the kingdom that now is.  And the thing which exceedingly
grieved Him is this, that by those very persons for whom, as for sons,
he did battle, He was assailed, on account of their ignorance.  And yet
He loved even those who hated Him, and wept over the unbelieving, and
blessed those who slandered Him, and prayed for those who were in enmity
against Him. <span id="fr_962"></span>[963](#fn_962.md)   And not only did
He do this as a father, but also taught His disciples to do the like,
bearing themselves as towards brethren. <span
id="fr_963"></span>[964](#fn_963.md)   This did our Father, this did our
Prophet.  This is reasonable, that He should be King over His children;
that by the affection of a father towards his children, and the
engrafted respect of children towards their father, eternal peace might
be produced.  For when the good man reigneth, there is true joy among
those who are ruled over, on account of him who rules.
