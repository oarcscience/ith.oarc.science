Life.</span>

<span id="vii.x.vii-p2"></span>One day, when Jesus was climbing on a
certain house, along with the children, He began to play with them.  And
one of the boys fell down through a back-door, and died immediately. 
And when the children saw this, they all ran away; but Jesus remained in
the house. <span id="fr_1767"></span>[1768](#fn_1767.md)   And when the
parents of the boy who had died had come, they spoke against Jesus: 
Surely it was thou who made him fall down; and they reviled Him.  And
Jesus, coming down from the house, stood over the dead child, and with a
loud voice called out the name of the child:  Sinoo, Sinoo, rise and say
whether it was I that made thee fall down.  And suddenly he rose up, and
said:  No, my lord.  And his parents, seeing such a great miracle done
by Jesus, glorified God, and adored Jesus.
