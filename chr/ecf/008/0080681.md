Case.</span>

well in your inquiry; for it will be for your safety.  Therefore
listen:  Since there are many things that are spoken by the Scriptures
against God, as time presses on account of the evening, ask with respect
to any one matter that you please, and I will explain it, showing that
it is false, not only because it is spoken against God, but because it
is really false.”  Then I answered:  “I wish to learn how, when the
Scriptures say that God is ignorant, you can show that He knows?”
