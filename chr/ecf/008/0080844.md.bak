Cæsarea.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.ix.xxvi-p2"></span>While I was saying these things to
Appion, Peter drew near from Cæsarea, and in Tyre the people were
flocking together, hurrying to meet him and unite in an expression of
gratification at his visit.  And Appion withdrew, accompanied by Anubion
and Athenodorus only; but the rest of us hurried to meet Peter, and I
was the first to greet him at the gate, and I led him towards the inn.
 When we arrived, we dismissed the people; and when he deigned to ask
what had taken place, I concealed nothing, but told him of Simon’s
slanders, and the monstrous shapes he had taken, and all the diseases he
had sent after the sacrificial feast, and that some of the sick persons
were still there in Tyre, while others had gone on with Simon to Sidon
just as I arrived, hoping to be cured by him, but that I had heard that
none of them had been cured by him.  I also told Peter of the
controversy I had with Appion; and he, from his love to me, and desiring
to encourage me, praised and blessed me.  Then, having supped, he betook
himself to the rest the fatigues of his journey rendered so necessary.
