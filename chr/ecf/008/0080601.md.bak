id="vi.iv.iii.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII.—Duties of Deacons.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.iii.xii-p2"></span>“Moreover let the deacons of the
church, going about with intelligence, be as eyes to the bishop,
carefully inquiring into the doings of each member of the church,
*ascertaining* who is about to sin, in order that, being arrested with
admonition by the president, he may haply not accomplish the sin.  Let
them check the disorderly, that they may not desist from assembling to
hear the discourses, so that they may be able to counteract by the word
of truth those anxieties that fall upon the heart from every side, by
means of worldly casualties and evil communications; for if they long
remain fallow, they become fuel for the fire.  And let them learn who
are suffering under bodily disease, and let them bring them to the
notice of the multitude who do not know of them, that they may visit
them, and supply their wants according to the judgment of the
president.  Yea, though they do this without his knowledge, they do
nothing amiss.  These things, then, and things like to these, let the
deacons attend to.
