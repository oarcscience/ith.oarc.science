id="vi.iv.vi.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVII.—Whether Adam Had the
Spirit.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.vi.xvii-p2"></span>“But I shall begin the statement
now.  God having made all things, if any one will not allow to a man,
fashioned by His hands, to have possessed His great and Holy Spirit of
foreknowledge, how does not he greatly err who attributes it to another
born of a spurious stock! <span id="fr_958"></span>[959](#fn_958)   And
I do not think that he will obtain pardon, though he be misled by
spurious scripture to think dreadful things against the Father of all. 
For he who insults the image and the things belonging to the eternal
King, has the sin reckoned as committed against Him in whose likeness
the image was made.  But then, says he, the Divine Spirit left him when
he sinned.  In that case *the Spirit* sinned along with him; and how can
he escape peril who says this?  But perhaps he received the Spirit after
he sinned.  Then it is given to the unrighteous; and where is justice? 
But it was afforded to the just and the unjust.  This were most
unrighteous of all.  Thus every falsehood, though it be aided by ten
thousand reasonings, must receive its refutation, though after a long
time.
