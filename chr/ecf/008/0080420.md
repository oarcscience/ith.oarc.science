<span id="vi.iii.x.xiv-p2"></span>“And, indeed, I know that several of
the philosophers were rather of this opinion, that God the Creator made
divisions and distinctions from one body, which they call <span
class="c9"><span id="vi.iii.x.xiv-p2.1"></span>Matter</span>, which yet
consisted of four elements, mingled into one by a certain tempering of
divine providence.  For I think that what some have said is vain, that
the body of the world is simple, that is, without any conjunction; since
it is evident that what is simple can neither be a body, nor can be
mixed, or propagated, or dissolved; all which, we see, happen to the
bodies of the world.  For how could it be dissolved if it were simple,
and had not within it that from which it might be resolved and divided? 
But if bodies seem to be composed of two, or three, or even of four
elements,—who that has even a small portion of sense does not perceive
that there must have been some one who collected several into one, and
preserving the measure of tempering, made a solid body out of diverse
parts?  This *some one,* therefore, we call God, the Creator of the
world, and acknowledge Him as the author of the universe.
