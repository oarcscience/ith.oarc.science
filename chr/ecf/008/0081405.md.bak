<span id="viii.iv.ii.iii-p2"></span>(Of those who have intercourse with
excommunicated persons, or with unbelievers.)

<span id="viii.iv.ii.iii-p3"></span>Those, too, who are excommunicated
by the priests, let no one receive previous to the just examination of
both sides; nor let him have any intercourse with such in speech, or in
eating or drinking, or in the salutation with the kiss, nor let him
greet such; because, whosoever wittingly holds intercourse with the
excommunicated in these or other prohibited matters, will subject
himself, according to the ordinance of the apostles, <span
id="fr_2734"></span>[2735](#fn_2734.md) to like excommunication.  From
these, therefore, let clergy and laity keep themselves if they would not
have the same penalty to endure.  Also do not join the unbelievers,
neither have any fellowship with them.  They who do such things, indeed,
are judged not as believers, but as unbelievers.  Whence the apostle
says:  “What part hath he that believeth with an infidel? or what
fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness?” <span
