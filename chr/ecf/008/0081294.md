<span id="vii.xiv.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vii.xiv.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 6 (22).</span>

<span id="vii.xiv.vi-p2"></span>Immediately Hades cried out:  We have
been conquered:  woe to us!  But who art thou, that hast such power and
might? and what art thou, who comest here without sin who art seen to be
small and yet of great power, lowly and exalted, the slave and the
master, the soldier and the king, who hast power over the dead and the
living?  Thou wast nailed on the cross, and placed in the tomb; and now
thou art free, and hast destroyed all our power.  Art thou then the
Jesus about whom the chief satrap Satan told us, that through cross and
death thou art to inherit the whole world?

<span id="vii.xiv.vi-p3"></span>Then the King of glory seized the chief
satrap Satan by the head, and delivered him to His angels, and said: 
With iron chains bind his hands and his feet, and his neck, and his
mouth.  Then He delivered him to Hades, and said:  Take him, and keep
him secure till my second appearing.
