Godliness.”</span>

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xiv-p2"></span>“This doctrine, even if it also be
mythical, being pious, would not be without advantage for this life. 
For every one, in expectation of being judged by the all-seeing God,
receives the greater impulse towards virtue.  But if the doctrine be
also true, it withdraws him who has lived virtuously from eternal
punishment, and endows him with eternal and unspeakable blessings from
God.
