id="vi.iv.vi.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII.—What is Impiety?</span>

<span id="vi.iv.vi.vii-p2"></span>“But impiety against Him is, in the
matter of religion, to die saying there is another God, whether superior
or inferior, or in any way saying that there is one besides Him who
really is.  For He who truly is, is He whose form the body of man bears;
for whose sake the heaven and all the stars, though in their essence
superior, submit to serve him who is in essence inferior, on account of
the form of the Ruler.  So much has God blessed man above all, in order
that, loving the Benefactor in proportion to the multitude of His
benefits, by means of this love he may be saved for the world to come.
