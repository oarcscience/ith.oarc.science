<span id="vii.xii.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vii.xii.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 1.</span>

<span id="vii.xii.ii-p2"></span>Having called a council, the high
priests and scribes Annas and Caiaphas and Semes and Dathaes, and
Gamaliel, Judas, Levi and Nephthalim, Alexander and Jaïrus, <span
id="fr_1803"></span>[1804](#fn_1803.md) and the rest of the Jews, came to
Pilate accusing Jesus about many things, saying:  We know this man to be
the son of Joseph the carpenter, born of Mary; and he says that he is
the Son of God, and a king; moreover, he profanes the Sabbath, and
wishes to do away with the law of our fathers.  Pilate says:  And what
are the things which he does, to show that he wishes to do away with
it? <span id="fr_1804"></span>[1805](#fn_1804.md)   The Jews say:  We have
a law not to cure any one on the Sabbath; but this man <span
id="fr_1805"></span>[1806](#fn_1805.md) has on the Sabbath cured the lame
and the crooked, the withered and the blind and the paralytic, the dumb
and the demoniac, by evil practices.  Pilate says to them:  What evil
practices?  They say to him:  He is a magician, and by Beelzebul prince
of the demons he casts out the demons, and all are subject to him. 
Pilate says to them:  This is not casting out the demons by an unclean
spirit, but by the god Æsculapius.

<span id="vii.xii.ii-p6"></span><span id="page_417">p. 417</span> <span
id="vii.xii.ii-Page_417"></span>The Jews say to Pilate:  we entreat your
highness that he stand at thy tribunal, and be heard. <span
id="fr_1806"></span>[1807](#fn_1806.md)   And Pilate having called them,
says:  Tell me how I, being a procurator, can try a king?  They say to
him:  We do not say that he is a king, but he himself says that he is. 
And Pilate having called the runner, says to him:  Let Jesus be brought
in with respect.  And the runner going out, and recognising Him, adored
Him, and took his cloak into his hand, and spread it on the ground, and
says to him:  My lord, walk on this, and come in, for the procurator
calls thee.  And the Jews seeing what the runner had done, cried out
against Pilate, saying:  Why hast thou ordered him to come in by a
runner, and not by a crier? for assuredly the runner, when he saw him,
adored him, and spread his doublet on the ground, and made him walk like
a king.

<span id="vii.xii.ii-p8"></span>And Pilate having called the runner,
says to him:  Why hast thou done this, and spread out thy cloak upon the
earth, and made Jesus walk upon it?  The runner says to him:  My lord
procurator, when thou didst send me to Jerusalem to Alexander, <span
id="fr_1807"></span>[1808](#fn_1807.md) I saw him sitting upon an ass, and
the sons of the Hebrews held branches in their hands, and shouted; and
other spread their clothes under him saying, Save now, thou who art in
the highest:  blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord. <span
id="fr_1808"></span>[1809](#fn_1808.md)

<span id="vii.xii.ii-p11"></span>The Jews cry out, and say to the
runner:  The sons of the Hebrews shouted in Hebrew; whence then hast
thou the Greek?  The runner says to them:  I asked one of the Jews, and
said, What is it they are shouting in Hebrew?  And he interpreted it for
me.  Pilate says to them:  And what did they shout in Hebrew?  The Jews
say to him:  <span class="c9"><span id="vii.xii.ii-p11.1"></span>Hosanna
membrome Baruchamma Adonaï</span>. <span
id="fr_1809"></span>[1810](#fn_1809.md)   Pilate says to them:  And this
hosanna, etc., how is it interpreted?  The Jews say to him:  Save now in
the highest; blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.  Pilate
says to them:  If you bear witness to the words spoken by the children,
in what has the runner done wrong?  And they were silent.  And the
procurator says to the runner:  Go out, and bring him in what way thou
wilt.  And the runner going out, did in the same manner as before, and
says to Jesus:  My lord, come in; the procurator calleth thee.

<span id="vii.xii.ii-p13"></span>And Jesus going in, and the
standard-bearers holding their standards, the tops of the standards were
bent down, and adored Jesus.  And the Jews seeing the bearing of the
standards, how they were bent down and adored Jesus, cried <span
id="fr_1810"></span>[1811](#fn_1810.md) out vehemently against the
standard-bearers.  And Pilate says to the Jews:  Do you not wonder how
the tops of the standards were bent down, and adored Jesus?  The Jews
say to Pilate:  We saw how the standard-bearers bent them down, and
adored him.  And the procurator having called the standard-bearers, says
to them:  Why have you done this?  They say to Pilate:  We are Greeks
and temple-slaves, and how could we adore him? and assuredly, as we were
holding them up, the tops bent down of their own accord, and adored him.

<span id="vii.xii.ii-p15"></span>Pilate says to the rulers of the
synagogue and the elders of the people:  Do you choose for yourselves
men strong and powerful, and let them hold up the standards, and let us
see whether they will bend down with them.  And the elders of the Jews
picked out twelve men powerful and strong, and made them hold up the
standards six by six; and they were placed in front of the procurator’s
tribunal.  And Pilate says to the runner:  Take him outside of the
prætorium, and bring him in again in whatever way may please thee.  And
Jesus and the runner went out of the prætorium.  And Pilate, summoning
those who had formerly held up the standards, says to them:  I have
sworn by the health of Cæsar, that if the standards do not bend down
when Jesus comes in, I will cut off your heads.  And the procurator
ordered Jesus to come in the second time.  And the runner did in the
same manner as before, and made many entreaties to Jesus to walk on his
cloak.  And He walked on it, and went in.  And as He went in, the
standards were again bent down, and adored Jesus.
