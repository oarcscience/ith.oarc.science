<span id="vi.iii.xii.xi-p2"></span>Then I answered:  “I shall therefore
tell you, my father, what is the nature of mathematics, and do you act
according to what I tell you.  Go to a mathematician, <span
id="fr_859"></span>[860](#fn_859.md) and tell him first that such and such
evils have befallen you at such a time, and that you wish to learn of
him whence, or how, or through what stars they have befallen you.  He
will no doubt answer you that a malignant Mars or Saturn has ruled your
times, or that some one of them has been periodic; or that some one has
regarded you diametrically, or in conjunction, or centrally; or some
such answer will he give, adding that in all these some one was not in
harmony with the malignant one, or was invisible, or was in the figure,
or was beyond the division, or was eclipsed, or was not in contact, or
was among the dark stars; and many other like things will he answer,
according to his own reasons, and will condescend upon particulars. 
After him go to another mathematician, and tell him the opposite, that
such and such good happened to you at that time, mentioning to him the
same time, and ask him from what parts of your <span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iii.xii.xi-p3.1"></span>Genesis</span> this good has come to you,
and take care, as I said, that the times are the same with those about
which you asked concerning evils.  And when you have deceived him
concerning the times, see what figures he will invent for you, by which
to show that good things ought to have befallen you at those very
times.  For it is impossible for those treating of the <span
class="c9"><span id="vi.iii.xii.xi-p3.2"></span>Genesis</span> of men
not to find in every quarter, as they call it, of the heavenly bodies,
some stars favourably placed, and some unfavourably; for the circle is
equally complete in every part, according to mathematics, admitting of
diverse and various causes, from which they can take occasion of saying
whatever they please.
