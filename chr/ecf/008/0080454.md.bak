id="vi.iii.x.xlviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLVIII.—Chastisements for
Sins.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.x.xlviii-p2"></span>“For in the beginning of the world
there were none of these evils, but they took their rise from the
impiety of men; and thence, with the constant increase of iniquities,
the number of evils has also increased.  But for this reason divine
providence has decreed a judgment with respect to all men, because the
present life was not such that every one could be dealt with according
to his deservings.  Those things, therefore, which were well and orderly
appointed from the beginning, when no causes of evil existed, are not to
be judged of from the evils which have befallen the world by reason of
the sins of men.  In short, as an indication of the things which were
from the beginning, some nations are found which are strangers to these
evils.  For the Seres, because they live chastely, are kept free from
them all; for with them it is unlawful to come at a woman after she has
conceived, or while she is being purified.  No one there eats unclean
flesh, no one knows aught of sacrifices; all are judges to themselves
according to justice.  For this reason they are not chastened with those
plagues which we have spoken of; they live to extreme old age, and die
without sickness.  But we, miserable as we are, dwelling as it were with
deadly serpents <span id="fr_821"></span>[822](#fn_821.md) —I mean with
wicked men—necessarily suffer with them the plagues of afflictions in
this world, but we cherish hope from the comfort of good things to
come.”
