<span id="vi.iv.xii.vi-p2"></span>“Thus, in this fashion, there ensued
many partitions of the one original kingdom.  The Persians, first taking
coals from the lightning which fell from heaven, preserved them by
ordinary fuel, and honouring the heavenly fire as a god, were honoured
by the fire itself with the first kingdom, as its first worshippers. 
After them the Babylonians, stealing coals from the fire that was there,
and conveying it safely to their own home, and worshipping it, they
themselves also reigned in order.  And the Egyptians, acting in like
manner, and calling the fire in their own dialect <span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iv.xii.vi-p2.1"></span>Phthaë</span>, which is translated <span
class="c9"><span id="vi.iv.xii.vi-p2.2"></span>Hephaistus</span> or
<span class="c9"><span id="vi.iv.xii.vi-p2.3"></span>Osiris</span>, he
who first reigned amongst them is called by its name.  Those also who
reigned in different places, acting in this fashion, and making an
image, and kindling altars in honour of fire, most of them were excluded
from the kingdom.
