<span id="vi.iv.vii.xii-p2"></span>“Therefore I say that the whole
learning of the Greeks is a most dreadful fabrication of a wicked
demon.  For they have introduced many <span id="page_254">p. 254</span>
<span id="vi.iv.vii.xii-Page_254"></span>gods of their own, and these
wicked, and subject to all kinds of passion; so that he who wishes to do
the like things may not be ashamed, which belongs to a man, having as an
example the wicked and unquiet lives of the mythological gods.  And
through his not being ashamed, such an one affords no hope of his
repenting.  And others have introduced fate, which is called genesis,
contrary to which no one can suffer or do anything.  This, therefore,
also is like to the first.  For any one who thinks that no one has aught
to do or suffer contrary to genesis easily falls into sin; and having
sinned, he does not repent of his impiety, holding it as his apology
that he was borne on by genesis to do these things.  And as he cannot
rectify genesis, he has no reason to be ashamed of the sins he
commits. <span id="fr_1035"></span>[1036](#fn_1035)
