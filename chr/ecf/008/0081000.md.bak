id="vi.iv.xv.xxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIX.—Sufferings of the
Good.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xv.xxix-p2"></span>Then Peter answered, “The prophet of
the truth has said, ‘Good things must needs come, and blessed, said he,
is he by whom they come; in like manner evil things must needs come, but
woe to him through whom they come.’ <span
id="fr_1149"></span>[1150](#fn_1149.md)   But if evil things come by means
of evil men, and good things are brought by good men, it must needs be
in each man as his own to be either good or bad, and proceeding from
what he has proposed, in order to the coming of the subsequent good or
evil, <span id="fr_1150"></span>[1151](#fn_1150.md) which, being of his own
choice, are not arranged by the providence of God to come from him. 
This being so, this is the judgment of God, that he who, as by a combat,
comes through all misfortune and is found blameless, he is deemed worthy
of eternal life; for those who by their own will continue in goodness,
are tempted by those who continue in evil by their own will, being
persecuted, hated, slandered, plotted against, struck, cheated, accused,
tortured, disgraced,—suffering all these things by which it seems
reasonable that they should be enraged and stirred up to vengeance.
