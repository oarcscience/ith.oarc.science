id="vi.iii.xi.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V.—Necessity of Inequality.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.xi.v-p2"></span>“But to make our meaning plainer, we
shall explain it by particulars.  Was it proper, for example, that all
men in this world should be kings, or princes, or lords, or teachers, or
lawyers, or geometers, or goldsmiths, or bakers, or smiths, or
grammarians, or rich men, or farmers, or perfumers, or fishermen, or
poor men?  It is certain that all could not be these.  Yet all these
professions, and many more, the life of men requires, and without these
it cannot be passed; therefore inequality is necessary in this world. 
For there cannot be a king, unless he has subjects over whom he may rule
and reign; nor can there be a master, unless he has one over whom he may
bear sway; and in like manner of the rest.
