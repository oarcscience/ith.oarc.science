Baptized.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.v.lxii-p2"></span>“Meantime I shall remain with you
three months, as I promised.  Be ye constant in hearing the word; and at
the end of that time, if any are able and willing to follow us, they may
do so, if duty will admit of it.  And when I say *if duty will admit* I
mean that no one by his departure must sadden any one who ought not to
be saddened, as by leaving parents who ought not to be left, or a
faithful wife, or any other person to whom he is bound to afford comfort
for God’s sake.”  Meantime, disputing and teaching day by day, he filled
up the time appointed with the labour of teaching; and when the festival
day arrived, upwards of ten thousand were baptized.
