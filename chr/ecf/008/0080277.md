id="vi.iii.vi.i-p2.1"></span>Chapter I.—Halt at Dora.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.vi.i-p3"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iii.vi.i-p3.1"></span>Having</span> set out from Cæsarea on the
way to Tripolis, we made our first stoppage at a small town called Dora,
because it was not far distant; and almost all those who had believed
through the preaching of Peter could scarcely bear to be separated from
him, but walked along with us, again and again gazing upon him, again
and again embracing him, again and again conversing with him, until we
came to the inn.  On the following day we came to Ptolemais, where we
stayed ten days; and when a considerable number had received the word of
God, we signified to some of them who seemed particularly attentive, and
wished to detain us longer for the sake of instruction, that they might,
if so disposed, follow us to Tripolis.  We acted in the same way at
Tyre, and Sidon, and Berytus, and announced to those who desired to hear
further discourses, that we were to spend the winter at Tripolis. <span
id="fr_717"></span>[718](#fn_717)   Therefore, as all those who were
anxious followed Peter from each city, we were a great multitude of
elect ones when we entered into Tripolis.  On our arrival, the brethren
who had been sent before met us before the gates of the city; and taking
us under their charge, conducted us to the various lodgings which they
had prepared.  Then there arose a commotion <span id="page_135">p.
135</span> <span id="vi.iii.vi.i-Page_135"></span>in the city, and a
great assemblage of persons desirous to see Peter. <span

<span id="vi.iii.vi.i-p4"></span> \[In books iv.–vi. the scene is laid
at Tripolis.  The same city is the locality to which Homilies VIII.–XI.
are assigned.  The intervening portion (Homilies IV.–VII.) gives the
details of the journey here alluded to, telling of various discourses at
Tyre.  Some of the matter of these discourses occurs in the
*Recognitions*, but under different circumstances.  The heathen
disputants are not the same.

<span id="vi.iii.vi.i-p5"></span>The parallelisms of the portions
assigned to Tripolis are as follows:  book iv. has its counterpart in
Homily VIII. and in much of Homily IX.; book v. has a parallel in Homily
X. and it, parts of XI.; book vi. in its general outline resembles
Homily XI.

<span id="vi.iii.vi.i-p6"></span>The discourses of the Apostle as given
in the *Recognitions* are more orderly and logical than those in the
*Homilies*.  The views presented differ somewhat, in accordance with the
general character of the two works.  Much of the matter in the
*Recognitions* occurs in a different order in the *Homilies*, but the
internal evidence seems to point to the priority of the former.  Both
might be different manipulations of a common documentary source, but
that theory is not necessarily applicable to these portions of the
literature.—R.\]
