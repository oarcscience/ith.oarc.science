id="vi.iii.vi.xxxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXVI.—The Garments
Unspotted.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.vi.xxxvi-p2"></span>“But the ways in which this garment
may be spotted are these:  If any one withdraw from God the Father and
Creator of all, receiving another teacher besides Christ, who alone is
the faithful and true Prophet, and who has sent us twelve apostles to
preach the word; if any one think otherwise than worthily of the
substance of the Godhead, which excels all things;—these are the things
which even fatally pollute the garment of baptism.  But the things which
pollute it in actions are these:  murders, adulteries, hatreds, avarice,
evil ambition.  And the things which <span id="page_143">p. 143</span>
<span id="vi.iii.vi.xxxvi-Page_143"></span>pollute at once the soul and
the body are these:  to partake of the table of demons, that is, to
taste things sacrificed, or blood, or a carcase which is
strangled, <span id="fr_747"></span>[748](#fn_747.md) and if there be aught
else which has been offered to demons.  Be this therefore the first step
to you of three; which step brings forth thirty commands, and the second
sixty, and the third a hundred, <span id="fr_748"></span>[749](#fn_748.md)
as we shall expound more fully to you at another time.”

<span id="vi.iii.vi.xxxvi-p3"></span> \[In Homily VII. 8 a similar
injunction is given, at Sidon.  The language in both places recalls
[Acts 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#020.md), [1 Cor.
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#021.md)<span

to the *Recognitions*.—R.\]

[20](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#020.md)<span

corresponds with that of the *Recognitions*.  The interpretation is a
fanciful one, indicating not only Judaistic legalism, but the notion of
esoteric teaching.  The passage shows Ebionitic tendencies.—R.\]
