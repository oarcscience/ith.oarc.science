id="vii.v.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 14.</span>

<span id="vii.v.xv-p2"></span>And on the third day after the birth of
our Lord Jesus Christ, the most blessed Mary went forth out of the cave,
and entering a stable, placed the child in the stall, and the ox and the
ass adored Him.  Then was fulfilled that which was said by Isaiah the
prophet, saying:  The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master’s
crib. <span id="fr_1644"></span>[1645](#fn_1644.md)   The very animals,
therefore, the ox and the ass, having Him in their midst, incessantly
adored Him.  Then was fulfilled that which was said by Abacuc the
prophet, saying: <span id="fr_1645"></span>[1646](#fn_1645.md)   Between
two animals thou art made manifest.  In the same place Joseph remained
with Mary three days.
