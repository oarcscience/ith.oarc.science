Gods.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.viii.xxiii-p2"></span>“‘They were not gods, then, but
representations of tyrants.  For a certain tomb is shown among the
Caucasian mountains, not in heaven, but in <span id="page_261">p.
261</span> <span id="vi.iv.viii.xxiii-Page_261"></span>earth, as that of
Kronos, a barbarous man and a devourer of children.  Further, the tomb
of the lascivious Zeus, so famed in story, who in like manner devoured
his own daughter Metis, is to be seen in Crete, and those of Pluto and
Poseidon in the Acherusian lake; and that of Helius in Astra, and of
Selene in Carræ, of Hermes in Hermopolis, of Ares in Thrace, of
Aphrodite in Cyprus, of Dionysus in Thebes, and of the rest in other
places.  At all events, the tombs are shown of those that I have named;
for they were men, and in respect of these things, wicked men and
magicians. <span id="fr_1052"></span>[1053](#fn_1052.md)   For else they
should not have become despots—I mean Zeus, renowned in story, and
Dionysus—but that by changing their forms they prevailed over whom they
pleased, for whatever purpose they designed.
