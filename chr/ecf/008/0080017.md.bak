<span id="iii.xv-p2"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="iii.xv-p2.1"></span>I had</span> prepared annotations for these
pages which I find will require more space than this overloaded volume
can afford.  Let me indicate some sources of information which the
student may find convenient.  Thus, in Liddon’s *Bampton Lecture* (4th
ed., London, 1869), consult p. 71 for remarks on Philo and Alexandrian
Jews; see also p. 91.  Concerning the “Book of Enoch,” pp. 7 and 302;
see Westcott, *Study of the Gospels* (London, 1867), p. 109, a reference
to the *Book of Jubilees*, and its lack of reference to Messiah.  See
Jewish doctrine of the Messiah, pp. 86, 143, 151; the “Book of Henoch,”
pp. 69, 93, 101; apocryphal words of Jews, p. 428.  He places the “Book
of Henoch” earlier than the “Book of Jubilees,” and the Twelve
Patriarchs after that.  Compare Westcott’s *Historic Faith* (London,
1883), a quotation from Goldwin Smith, on “the blood of Christ,” note 8,
p. 237.

<span id="iii.xv-p3"></span>I cannot forbear to note, among useful
suggestions in these *Testaments*, that (on p. 11) of the share of
Simeon in the persecution of Joseph.  It explains the real purpose of
Joseph in selecting Simeon as the hostage to be left in Egypt ([Gen.
xlii. 21-24](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#021.md)<span
id="iii.xv-p3.1"></span>.)  Joseph heard the mutual reproaches of his
brothers, and foresaw that Simeon would be made to suffer as most
guilty:  so he was withdrawn.  Again, a like anxiety ([Gen. xlv.
2](../../../bib/kjv/gen045.htm#002)<span id="iii.xv-p3.2"></span>.md)
appears when Simeon was sent back with them to his father.  Other
suggestions may be noted as substantially illustrating the sacred
narrative.
