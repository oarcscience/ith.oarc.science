<span id="iv.ii-p5"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="iv.ii-p5.1"></span>We</span> may thank Mr. Wilson, the translator,
for separating this collection, absolutely, from the works of Clement of
Alexandria, to which it has been made an appendix.  The reference to
“our Pantænus” gives the only colour for such a collocation with so
great a name.  It is the work of a Montanist, perhaps, who may have had
some relations with the Alexandrian school; but it is hard to say
precisely who of three or four named Theodotus (all heretics), may have
made the compilation, more especially because disjointed and
contradictory fragments seem mixed up in it as it is commonly edited. 
Dupin (perhaps too readily copying Valesius) appears to think Clement
may have been the compiler, but that, like the *Hypotyposes*, the work
was the product of days when he was imperfectly educated in Christian
truth.  It seems to me more reasonable to conclude that these excerpts,
and what goes by the name of *Fragments from the Hypotyposes*, are alike
corrupt or forged documents, for which Clement’s name has been borrowed,
to give them some credit; and I can desire no better authority for this
opinion than that of Jeremiah Jones, with the arguments to be found in
his learned work on the *Canon*. <span id="fr_194"></span>[195](#fn_194.md)

<span id="iv.ii-p7"></span>The wretched performance, therefore, is
valuable chiefly as illustrating certain heresies of the second century;
but, incidentally, it is of considerable importance as confirming the
orthodox writers in those books and doctrines to which it bears witness
in coincidence with them.

<span id="iv.ii-p8"></span>I regret that the Edinburgh editors give us
not a line of information as to their estimate of these extracts, or
concerning authorship and like matters of interest and natural
curiosity.
