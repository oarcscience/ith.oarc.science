<span id="vii.xxiii.iii"></span>

<span id="vii.xxiii.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vii.xxiii.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 3.</span>

<span id="vii.xxiii.iii-p2"></span>Having therefore done many and
dreadful things against Jesus that night, they gave Him up to Pilate the
procurator at the dawn of the preparation, that he might crucify Him;
and for this purpose they all came together.  After a trial, therefore,
Pilate the procurator ordered Him to be nailed to the cross, along with
the two robbers.  And they were nailed up along with Jesus, Gestas on
the left, and Demas on the right.

<span id="vii.xxiii.iii-p3"></span>And he that was on the left began to
cry out, saying to Jesus:  See how many evil deeds I have done in the
earth; and if I had known that thou wast the king, I should have cut off
thee also.  And why dost thou call thyself Son of God, and canst not
help thyself in necessity? how canst thou afford it to another one
praying for help?  If thou art the Christ, come down from the cross,
that I may believe in thee.  But now I see thee perishing along with me,
not like a man, but like a wild beast.  And many other things he began
to say against Jesus, blaspheming and gnashing his teeth upon Him.  For
the robber was taken alive in the snare of the devil. <span
id="fr_2038"></span>[2039](#fn_2038)

<span id="vii.xxiii.iii-p5"></span>But the robber on the right hand,
whose name was Demas, seeing the Godlike grace of Jesus, thus cried
out:  I know Thee, Jesus Christ, that Thou art the Son of God.  I see
Thee, Christ, adored by myriads of myriads of angels.  Pardon me my sins
which I have done.  Do not in my trial make the stars come against me,
or the moon, when Thou shalt judge all the world; because in the night I
have accomplished my wicked purposes.  Do not urge the sun, which is now
darkened on account of Thee, to tell the evils of my heart, for no gift
can I give Thee for the remission of my sins.  Already death is coming
upon me because of my sins; but Thine is the propitiation.  Deliver me,
O Lord of all, from Thy fearful judgment.  Do not give the enemy power
to swallow me up, and to become heir of my soul, as of that of him who
is hanging on the left; for I see how the devil joyfully takes his soul,
and his body disappears.  Do not even order me to go away into the
portion of the Jews; for I see Moses and the patriarchs in great
weeping, and the devil rejoicing over them.  Before, then, O Lord, my
spirit departs, order my sins to be washed away, and remember me the
sinner in Thy kingdom, when upon the great most lofty throne <span
id="fr_2039"></span>[2040](#fn_2039) thou shalt judge the twelve tribes
of Israel. <span id="fr_2040"></span>[2041](#fn_2040)   For Thou hast
prepared great punishment for Thy world on account of Thyself.

<span id="vii.xxiii.iii-p8"></span>And the robber having thus spoken,
Jesus says to him:  Amen, amen; I say to thee, Demas, that to-day thou
shalt be with me in paradise. <span id="fr_2041"></span>[2042](#fn_2041)
  And the sons of the kingdom, the children of Abraham, and Isaac, and
Jacob, and Moses, shall be cast out into outer darkness; there shall be
weeping and gnashing of teeth. <span
id="fr_2042"></span>[2043](#fn_2042)   And thou alone shalt dwell in
paradise until my second appearing, when I am to judge those who do not
<span id="page_470">p. 470</span> <span
id="vii.xxiii.iii-Page_470"></span>confess my name.  And He said to the
robber:  Go away, and tell the cherubim and the powers, that turn the
flaming sword, that guard paradise from the time that Adam, the first
created, was in paradise, and sinned, and kept not my commandments, and
I cast him out thence.  And none of the first shall see paradise until I
am to come the second time to judge living and dead.  And He wrote
thus:  Jesus Christ the Son of God, who have come down from the heights
of the heavens, who have come forth out of the bosom of the invisible
Father without being separated from Him, <span
id="fr_2043"></span>[2044](#fn_2043) and who have come down into the
world to be made flesh, and to be nailed to a cross, in order that I
might save Adam, whom I fashioned,—to my archangelic powers, the
gatekeepers of paradise, to the officers of my Father:  I will and order
that he who has been crucified along with me should go in, should
receive remission of sins through me; and that he, having put on an
incorruptible body, should go in to paradise, and dwell where no one has
ever been able to dwell.

<span id="vii.xxiii.iii-p12"></span>And, behold, after He had said this,
Jesus gave up the ghost, on the day of the preparation, at the ninth
hour.  And there was darkness over all the earth; and from a great
earthquake that happened, the sanctuary fell down, and the wing of the
temple.
