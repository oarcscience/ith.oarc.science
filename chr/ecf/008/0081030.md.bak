<span id="vi.iv.xvii.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.xvii.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter III.—The Old Man Does Not
Believe in God or Providence.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xvii.iii-p2"></span>“The old man began to speak as
follows:  ‘When I saw you after you had bathed in the sea retire into
the secret place, I went up and secretly watched what might be your
object in entering into a secret place, and when I saw you pray, I
retired; <span id="fr_1194"></span>[1195](#fn_1194.md) but taking pity on
you, I waited that I might speak with you when you came out, and prevail
on you not to be led astray.  For there is neither God nor providence;
but all things are subject to Genesis. <span
id="fr_1195"></span>[1196](#fn_1195.md)   Of this I am fully assured in
consequence of what I have myself endured, having for a long time made a
careful study of the science. <span id="fr_1196"></span>[1197](#fn_1196.md)
  Do not therefore be deceived, my child.  For whether you pray or not,
you must endure what is assigned to you by Genesis.  For if prayers
could have <span id="page_306">p. 306</span> <span
id="vi.iv.xvii.iii-Page_306"></span>done anything or any good, I myself
should now be in better circumstances.  And now, unless my needy
garments mislead you, you will not refuse to believe what I say.  I was
once in affluent circumstances; I sacrificed much to the gods, I gave
liberally to the needy; and yet, though I prayed and acted piously, I
was not able to escape my destiny.’  And I said:  ‘What are the
calamities you have endured?’  And he answered:  ‘I need not tell you
now; perhaps at the end you shall learn who I am, and who are my
parents, and into what straitened circumstances I have fallen.  But at
present I wish you to become fully assured that everything is subject to
Genesis.’

the stars which rule at each man’s birth.  \[Comp. iv. 12.  In

the same way.—R.\]
