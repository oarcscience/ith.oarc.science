<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.xii.xiii-p2"></A>&#8220;If you have anything that you wish to say to this, say on.&#8221;&#160; Then my father:&#160; &#8220;Nothing can be more true, my son, than what you have stated.&#8221;&#160; And while we were thus speaking among ourselves, some one informed us that a great multitude of people were standing outside, having assembled for the purpose of hearing.&#160; Then Peter ordered them to be admitted, for the place was large and convenient.&#160; And when they had come in, Peter said to us:&#160; &#8220;If any one of you wishes, let him address the people, and discourse concerning idolatry.&#8221;&#160; To whom I Clement answered:&#160; &#8220;Your great benignity and gentleness and patience towards all encourages us, so that we dare speak in your presence, and ask what we please; and therefore, as I said, the gentleness of your disposition invites and encourages all to undertake the precepts of saving doctrine.&#160; This I never saw before in any one else, but in you only, with whom there is neither envy nor indignation.&#160; Or what do you think?</p>
