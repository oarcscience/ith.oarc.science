id="vi.iii.iii.xli-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLI.—Rejection of the True
Prophet.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iii.xli-p2"></span>“But some one perhaps may say that
it is possible for any one to imitate a number; but what shall we say of
the signs and miracles which He wrought?  For Moses had wrought miracles
and cures in Egypt.  He also of whom he foretold that He should rise up
a prophet like unto himself, though He cured every sickness and
infirmity among the people, wrought innumerable miracles, and preached
eternal life, was hurried by wicked men to the cross; which deed was,
however, by His power turned to good.  In short, while He was suffering,
all the world suffered with Him; for the sun was darkened, the mountains
were torn asunder, the graves were opened, the veil of the temple was
rent, <span id="fr_568"></span>[569](#fn_568.md) as in lamentation for the
destruction impending over the place.  And yet, though all the world was
moved, they themselves are not even now moved to the consideration of
these so great things.”
