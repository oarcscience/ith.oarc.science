Poets.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.xii.xxxviii-p2"></span>“But if, as they say, these
things, so creditably and piously done, are dispensed by so
discreditable and impious a ritual, assuredly he is sacrilegious,
whoever either gave forth these things at first, or persists in
fulfilling them, now that they have unhappily been given forth.  And
what shall we say of the books of the poets?  Ought not they, if they
have debased the honourable and pious deeds of the gods with base
fables, to be forthwith cast away and thrown into the fire, that they
may not persuade the still tender age of boys that Jupiter himself, the
chief of the gods, was a parricide towards his parents, incestuous
towards his sisters and his daughters, and even impure towards boys;
that Venus and Mars were adulterers, and all those things which have
been spoken of above?  What do you think of this matter, my lord Peter?”
