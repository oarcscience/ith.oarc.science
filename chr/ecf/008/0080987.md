id="vi.iv.xv.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVI.—The Shipwreck.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xv.xvi-p2"></span>“However, that matters might be thus
arranged, I resolved to fabricate a dream, to the effect that some one
stood by me by night, and thus spoke:  ‘O woman, straightway leave the
city with your twin children for some time, until I shall charge you to
return hither again; otherwise you forthwith shall die miserably, with
your husband and all your children.’  And so I did.  For as soon as I
told the false dream to my husband, he being alarmed, sent me off by
ship to Athens with my two sons, and with slaves, maids, and abundance
of money, to educate the boys, until, said he, it shall please the giver
of the oracle that you return to me.  But, wretch that I am, while
sailing with my children, I was driven by the fury of the winds into
these regions, and the ship having gone to pieces in the night, I was
wrecked.  And all the rest having died, my unfortunate self alone was
tossed by a great wave and cast upon a rock; and while I sat upon it in
my misery, I was prevented, by the hope of finding my children alive,
from throwing myself into the deep then, when I could easily have done
it, having my soul made drunk by the waves.
