Continued.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.ix.xvii-p2"></span>“But when the day dawned, and I with
shouting and howling was looking around, if I could even see the corpses
of my unhappy sons anywhere washed ashore, some of those who saw me were
moved with compassion, and searched, first over the sea, and then also
along the shores, if they could find either of my children.  But when
neither of them was anywhere found, the women of the place, taking pity
on me, began to comfort me, every one telling her own griefs, that I
might take consolation from the likeness of their calamities to my own. 
But this saddened me all the more; for my disposition was not such that
I could regard the misfortunes of others as comforts to me.  And when
many desired to receive me hospitably, a certain poor woman who dwells
here constrained me to enter into her hut, saying that she had had a
husband who was a sailor, and that he had died at sea while a young man,
and that, although many afterwards asked her in marriage, she preferred
widowhood through love of her husband.  ‘Therefore,’ said she, ‘we shall
share whatever we can gain by the labour of our hands.’
