<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.viii.viii-p2"></A>&#8220;But now I lead you to understanding by the same paths.&#160; For you see that all things are produced from waters.&#160; But water was made at first by the Only-begotten; and the Almighty God is the head of the Only-begotten, by whom we come to the Father in such order as we have stated above.&#160; But when you have come to the Father you will learn that this is His will, that you be born anew by means of waters, which were first created.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_782"></A><A HREF="#fn_782"><FONT SIZE="1">783</FONT></A>
&#160; For he who is regenerated by water, having filled up the measure of good works, is made heir of Him by whom he has been regenerated in incorruption.&#160; Wherefore, with prepared minds, approach as sons to a father, that your sins may be washed away, and it may be proved before God that ignorance was their sole cause.&#160; For if, after the learning of these things, you remain in unbelief, the cause of your destruction will be imputed to yourselves, and not to ignorance.&#160; And do you suppose that you can have hope towards God, even if you cultivate all piety and all righteousness, but do not receive baptism.&#160; Yea rather, he will be worthy or greater punishment, who does good works not well; for merit accrues to men from good works, but only if they be done as God commands.&#160; Now God <A NAME="page_155"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 155</FONT></A> <a name="vi.iii.viii.viii-Page_155"></A>has ordered every one who worships Him to be sealed by baptism; but if you refuse, and obey your own will rather than God&#146;s, you are doubtless contrary and hostile to His will.</p>
