<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.v.vi-p2"></A>Then Peter said:&#160; &#8220;If you truly wish to learn, then first learn this, how unskilfully you have framed your question; for you say, Since God has created all things, whence is evil?&#160; But before you asked this, three sorts of questions should have had the precedence:&#160; <i>First</i>, Whether there be evil?&#160; <i>Secondly</i>, What evil is?&#160; <i>Thirdly</i>, To whom it is, and whence?&#8221;&#160; To this Simon answered:&#160; &#8220;Oh thou most unskilful and unlearned, is there any man who does not confess that there is evil in this life?&#160; Whence I also, thinking that you had even the common sense of all men, asked, whence evil is; not as wishing to learn, since I know all things, least of all from you, who know nothing, but that I might show you to be ignorant of all things.&#160; And that you may not suppose that it is because I am angry that I speak somewhat sternly, know that I am moved with compassion for those who are present, whom you are attempting to deceive.&#8221;&#160; Then Peter said:&#160; &#8220;The more wicked are you, if you can do such wrong, not being angry; but smoke must rise where there is fire.&#160; Nevertheless I shall tell you, lest I should seem to take you up with words, so as not to answer to those things which you have spoken disorderly.&#160; You say that all confess the existence of evil, which is verily false; for, first of all, the whole Hebrew nation deny its existence.&#8221;</p>
