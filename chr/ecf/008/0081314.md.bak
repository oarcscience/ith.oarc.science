<span id="vii.xv.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vii.xv.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 13.</span>

<span id="vii.xv.xiv-p2"></span>And while they were sitting in the
synagogue, and recriminating about Joseph, there came certain of the
guards whom they had asked from Pilate to guard the sepulchre of Jesus,
lest His disciples coming should steal Him.  And they reported, saying
to the rulers of the synagogue, and the priests and the Levites, what
had happened:  how there had happened a great earthquake, and we saw how
an angel of the Lord came down from heaven, and rolled away the stone
from the door of the tomb, and sat upon it; and his countenance was like
lightning, and his raiment like snow.  And for fear, we became as dead. 
And we heard the voice of the angel speaking to the women who had come
to the sepulchre, and saying, Be not ye afraid; for I know that ye seek
Jesus who was crucified:  He is not here; He has risen, as He said: 
come and see the place where the Lord was laid.  And go immediately and
tell His disciples that He has risen from the dead, and will go before
you into Galilee, as He said to you.

<span id="vii.xv.xiv-p3"></span>The Jews say:  To what women was he
speaking?  The soldiers say:  We do not know who the women were.  The
Jews say:  At what hour was it?  The guards say:  At midnight.  The Jews
say:  And why did you not detain them?  The guards say:  We became as
dead from fear of the angel, not hoping now to see the light of day; and
how could we detain them?  The Jews says:  *As* the Lord God liveth, we
do not believe you.  And the guards said to the Jews:  You have seen so
great signs in that man, and have not believed; and how can you believe
us, that the Lord lives?  For well have ye sworn that the Lord Jesus
Christ lives.  Again the guards say to the Jews:  we have heard that you
have shut up Joseph, who begged the body of Jesus, in the prison, and
have sealed it with your rings; and on opening, that you have not found
him.  Give us Joseph, then, and we shall give you Jesus Christ.  The
Jews said:  Joseph has gone to Arimathea, his own city.  The guards say
to the Jews:  And Jesus, as we have heard from the angel, is in Galilee.

<span id="vii.xv.xiv-p4"></span>And the Jews, hearing these sayings,
feared exceedingly, saying:  Lest at some time or other this saying be
heard, and all believe in Jesus.  And the Jews, taking counsel among
themselves, brought forth a sufficient number of silver pieces, and gave
to the soldiers, saying:  Say that, while we slept, his disciples came
and stole him.  And if this be heard by the governor, we shall
persuade <span id="fr_1964"></span>[1965](#fn_1964.md) him, and make you
secure.  And the soldiers, taking *the money*, said as they were advised
by the Jews; and their saying was spread abroad among all.
