Disobedience.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.vi.lxvi-p2"></span>“And your work is to order what
things are proper; and that of the brethren is to submit, and not to
disobey.  Therefore submitting they shall be saved, but disobeying they
shall be punished by the Lord, because the president is entrusted with
the place of Christ.  Wherefore, indeed, honour or contempt shown to the
president is handed on to Christ, and from Christ to God.  And this I
have said, that these brethren may not be ignorant of the danger they
incur by disobedience to you, because whosoever disobeys your orders,
disobeys Christ; and he who disobeys Christ offends God.
