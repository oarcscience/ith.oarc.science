<span id="vi.iii.xii.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iii.xii.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVI.—“Would that All God’s
People Were Prophets.”</span>

<span id="vi.iii.xii.xvi-p2"></span>But when I was about to speak,
Niceta, biting his lip, beckoned to me to be silent.  And when Peter saw
him, he said:  “Why would you repress his liberal disposition and noble
nature, that you would have him be silent for my honour, which is
nothing?  Or do you not know, that if all nations, after they have heard
from me the preaching of the truth, and have believed, would betake
themselves to teaching, they would gain the greater glory for me, if
indeed you think me desirous of glory?  For what so glorious as to
prepare disciples for Christ, not who shall be silent, and shall be
saved alone, but who shall speak what they have learned, and shall do
good to others?  I wish indeed that both you, Niceta, and you, beloved
Aquila, would aid me in preaching the word of God, and the rather
because those things in which the Gentiles err are well known to you;
and not you only, but all who hear me, I wish, as I have said, so to
hear and to learn, that they may be able also to teach:  for the world
needs many helpers, by whom men may be recalled <span id="page_197">p.

he had spoken thus, he said to me:  “Go on then, Clement, with what you
have begun.”
