Peace.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.vi.lxii-p2"></span>“But, further, let the things that
are happening before your eyes persuade you; how wars are constantly
arising through there being now many kings all over the earth.  For each
one holds the government of another as a pretext for war.  But if one
were universal superior, he, having no reason why he should make war,
would have perpetual peace.  In short, therefore, to those who are
thought worthy of eternal life, God appoints one universal King in the
world that shall then be, that by means of monarchy there may be
unfailing peace.  It behoves all, therefore, to follow some one as a
leader, honouring him as the image of God; and it behoves the leader to
be acquainted with the road that entereth into the holy city.
