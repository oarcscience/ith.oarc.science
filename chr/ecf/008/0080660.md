id="vi.iv.v.xxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVII.—His Promises.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.v.xxvii-p2"></span>When Aquila had thus spoken, his
brother Nicetas said:  “It is necessary, O Clement our brother, for me
to mention what has been left out by Aquila.  For, in the first place,
God is witness that we assisted him in no impious work, but that we
looked on while he wrought; and as long as he did harmless things, and
exhibited them, we were also pleased.  But when, in order to deceive the
godly, he said that he did, by means of godhead, the things that were
done by magic, we no longer endured him, though he made us many
promises, especially that our statues should be thought worthy of *a
place in* the temple, <span id="fr_940"></span>[941](#fn_940) and that
we should be thought to be gods, and should be worshipped by the
multitude, and should be honoured by kings, and should be thought worthy
of public honours, and enriched with boundless wealth.
