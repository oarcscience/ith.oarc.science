<span id="viii.viii.i-p4"></span><span class="c6"><span
id="viii.viii.i-p4.1"></span>The First Epistle.</span>

<span id="viii.viii.i-p5"></span><span class="c29"><span
id="viii.viii.i-p5.1"></span>To All the Ministers of the Church
Catholic.</span>

<span id="viii.viii.i-p6"></span>Of those who ought not to be admitted
to clear themselves, and of the duty of having no fellowship with the
excommunicated.

<span id="viii.viii.i-p7"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="viii.viii.i-p7.1"></span>To</span> the dearly-beloved brethren in
the ministry of the Church Catholic in all regions, Fabian sends
greeting in the Lord.

<span id="viii.viii.i-p8"></span>By the divine precepts and the
apostolic institutes, we are admonished to watch in behoof of the
position of all the churches with unwearied interest.  Whence it follows
that you ought to know what is being done in things sacred in the church
of Rome, in order that, by following her example, ye may be found to be
true children of her who is called your mother.  Accordingly, as we have
received the institution from our fathers, we maintain seven deacons in
the city of Rome distributed over seven districts of the state, who
attend to the services enjoined on them week by week, and on the Lord’s
days and the solemn festivals, in concert with the subdeacons, and
acolytes, and servants of the succeeding orders, and hold themselves in
readiness every hour for religious duty, and for the discharge of all
that is enjoined upon them.  In like manner ought ye also to do
throughout your different cities, as may be convenient, that religious
duty may be discharged zealously and regularly, without any delay or
negligence.  Furthermore, we have ordained in like manner seven
subdeacons who shall stand by (*imminerent*) the seven notaries, and
bring into one full and accurate account the histories of the martyrs,
and lay them before us for our examination.  And this, too, we urge you
all to do, so that no doubt or questioning of these things may arise in
later times; “for whatsoever things were written, were written for our
learning.” <span id="fr_2826"></span>[2827](#fn_2826.md)   And whatsoever
things are written in truth in our times, are directed to the learning
of future times.  And therefore we enjoin these duties to be put in
charge of the most faithful, that nothing false may be found in them,
from which an offence (which may God forbid) may arise to the faithful. 
For this reason also we beg it of your love in paternal benignity, that
the holy Church may now find the good-will of your love in all things,
and obtain the comforts of your favour whenever there is necessity.  And
as the goodness of your zeal affords us the assurance that we ought to
distrust it in nothing, but rather commit these things in all confidence
to you as to wise sons of our church; so, small importance being
attached to opportune occasions, your virtue ought to exert itself the
more strenuously in labours, and keep off reproaches by all possible
means, and with all zeal.  We exhort you also, according to the word of
the apostle, to be “stedfast and immoveable, always abounding in the
work of the Lord; forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not vain in
the Lord.” <span id="fr_2827"></span>[2828](#fn_2827.md)   And in another
place:  “Watch ye, and pray, and stand fast in the faith.  Quit you like
men, and be strong.  Let all things be done with charity.” <span
id="fr_2828"></span>[2829](#fn_2828.md)   Furthermore, we desire you to
know this, that in our times, as our sins embarrassed us, and that
ancient enemy who always goeth about like a roaring lion, seeking whom
he may devour, <span id="fr_2829"></span>[2830](#fn_2829.md) instigated
him, Novatus came up out of Africa, and separated Novatianus and certain
other confessors of Christ from the Church of Christ, and persuaded them
into the acceptance of evil doctrine.  From such persons, brethren, keep
yourselves aloof, and beware of all who hold a faith and doctrine
different from that which the apostles and their successors have held
and taught, lest (which may God forbid) going after him ye fall into the
toils of Satan, and be bound with his fetters.  Wherefore with most
earnest prayers we beg it of your brotherly love, that ye may deem it
fit to remember our insignificance in your holy prayers, beseeching and
entreating the Lord of <span id="page_631">p. 631</span> <span
id="viii.viii.i-Page_631"></span>heaven that we, as well as our holy
mother the Church of Christ, redeemed with His precious blood, may be
delivered from the toils of Satan, who lieth in wait for us; and from
troublesome and wicked men, and that the Word of God may have free
course and be glorified, and that the evil doctrine of them, and of all
who teach things contrary to the truth, may be overthrown and perish. 
We beseech you also to be zealous in praying in your pious
supplications, that our God and Lord Jesus Christ, who will have all men
to be saved, and no one to perish, <span
id="fr_2830"></span>[2831](#fn_2830.md) may, by His vast omnipotence, cause
their hearts to turn again to sound doctrine and to the Catholic faith,
in order that they may be recovered from the toils of the devil who are
held captive by him, and be united with the children of our mother the
Church.  Be mindful also of your brethren, and have pity upon them, and
labour for them by all means in your power, that they be not lost, but
be saved unto the Lord by your prayers, and other efforts of your
goodness.  So act therefore in these matters that ye may approve
yourselves as obedient and faithful children of the holy Church of God,
and that ye may obtain the recompense of reward.  These men, and all
else who do not teach the true doctrine, and hold not the true faith,
cannot act as accusers of any true believer, because they are branded
with infamy, and are cut off from the bosom of our holy mother the
Church by the sword of the apostles, until their return to correct
conversation and belief.  Hence by apostolic authority, and in agreement
with all the sons of the same apostolic and universal Church, we resolve
that all who come under suspicion with respect to the Catholic faith
cannot be admitted as accusers of those who hold the true creed; for
suspicions are always to be set aside.  Rightly therefore are charges
which are preferred by those who are objects of suspicion in the matter
of the true faith, rejected.  Neither are they at all to be credited who
are unacquainted with the faith of the Trinity.  In like manner we set
aside and withdraw from all part in the accusing of the faithful, all
those whom the decrees of the holy fathers in times past and times
future alike anathematize.  Accordingly, the believing ought always to
be kept distinct from the unbelieving, and the righteous from the
unrighteous; since the unbelieving and evil-minded, by every means in
their power, are always troubling the believing, and striving to undo
them; and consequently they are not to be received, but rejected and
kept entirely at a distance, lest they may undo or defame the
believing.  For this reason, dearly beloved, beware of the pit of such
persons, into which we know many have fallen.  Beware of the snares (or
darts) of such persons, and of the efforts of the ancient enemy, by
which we have seen even those closely connected with us fall wounded
before us.  Watch the nooses of the liers in wait, by which they are
wont to strangle associates and comrades.  Follow not such, but keep
them far off from you.  Be ye, according to the voice of Truth, wise as
serpents and harmless as doves. <span
id="fr_2831"></span>[2832](#fn_2831.md)   See to it that ye neither run nor
labour in vain; but, sustained by each other’s prayers and
supplications, strive ye to do the will of God; and from those persons
whom I have mentioned, if they show themselves incorrigible, keep
yourselves separate in all things.  In like manner keep yourselves
separate from all those of whom the apostle makes mention when he says,
“with such persons, no, not to eat;” <span
id="fr_2832"></span>[2833](#fn_2832.md) since these latter, as well as the
former, are to be rejected, and are not to be admitted before they have
given satisfaction to the Church.  For those with whom it is not lawful
to eat are manifestly separated from all intercourse with the rest of
the brethren until such satisfaction is given.  Wherefore they ought not
and cannot be admitted to the preferring of charges against the
faithful, but they ought to be debarred from their society until the
satisfaction already mentioned is given, lest these too should be made
like them, or underlie their excommunication; for to this effect have
the apostles decreed, saying, With the excommunicated no fellowship is
to be held.  And if any one, setting aside the rules wittingly, sings
with the excommunicated in his house, or speaks or prays in company with
them, that man is to be deprived of the privilege of communion.  Such
persons, therefore, are in all things to be guarded against, and are not
to be received, because, according to the apostle, not only those who
commit such things are condemned, but also those who consent with those
who do them. <span id="fr_2833"></span>[2834](#fn_2833.md)   Whence also
the blessed chief of the apostles, Peter, addressing the people at the
ordination of Clement, says this among other things: <span
id="fr_2834"></span>[2835](#fn_2834.md)   If this Clement is hostile to any
one on account of his deeds, wait not ye for his saying directly to you,
Be not on terms of friendship with this man.  But mark ye carefully his
will as ye ought, and second it without need of direct injunction; and
separate yourselves from that man to whom ye perceive him to be
inimical, and speak not with those with whom he speaks not, in order
that every one who may be in fault, as he desires to possess the
friendship of all of you, may be zealous in effecting a reconciliation
all the more quickly with him who presides over all, so that he may
return to spiritual well-being (*redeat et salutem*) hereby, when <span
id="page_632">p. 632</span> <span id="viii.viii.i-Page_632"></span>he
begins to yield obedience to the charges of the president.

<span id="viii.viii.i-p18"></span>If, however, any one is not friendly,
and speaks with those with whom he (his chief) speaks not, such an one
belongs to those who seek to exterminate the Church of God; and though
he seems to be with you in body, he is against you in mind and heart. 
And such an one is a much more dangerous enemy than those who are
without, and who are openly hostile.  For this man under the guise of
friendship acts the part of an enemy, and scatters and ruins the
church.  And therefore, dearly beloved, in these apostolic institutes we
warn and teach you, that your charity, being instructed therein
(*effecta certior*), may hereafter study to act with greater care and
prudence, so that perverse and unbelieving men may not have the power of
injuring the faithful and well-disposed; for the hope of such, and of
all the ungodly, is like dust that is blown away with the wind; and like
a thin froth that is driven away with the storm; and like as the smoke
which is dispersed here and there with a tempest, and as the remembrance
of a guest of a single day that passeth away. <span
id="fr_2835"></span>[2836](#fn_2835.md)   With the utmost care, dearly
beloved, are such persons to be guarded against, and avoided, and
rejected, if they show themselves injurious.  For the laws of the world,
no less than those of the Church, do not admit the injurious, but reject
them.  Whence it is written, “The mouth of the wicked devoureth
iniquity.” <span id="fr_2836"></span>[2837](#fn_2836.md)   And the Lord,
speaking by the prophet, saith, “With the holy thou wilt show thyself
holy; and with the froward thou wilt show thyself froward; and with the
excellent thou wilt show thyself excellent (*electus*); and with the
innocent man thou wilt show thyself innocent.” <span
id="fr_2837"></span>[2838](#fn_2837.md)   And the apostle says, “Evil
communications corrupt good manners.” <span
id="fr_2838"></span>[2839](#fn_2838.md)   Wherefore, as has already been
indicated, the wicked are always to be avoided and shunned, and the good
and rightly-disposed are to be stedfastly followed, in order that, as
far as possible, we may avoid the peril of sloth.  And lest this pest
may be spread abroad more widely, let us cut it off from us with all
possible severity; for the temerity of presumption does not intervene
where there is the diligence of piety.  Let every one of you, sustained
by this apostolic representation, act according to his strength, and
study in brotherly love and in godly piety to keep his own manners
correct, and to help each other, and to abide in charity, and to keep
himself in the will of God unceasingly, in order that we may praise the
Lord together, and give Him thanks always without wearying.  Fare ye
well in the Lord, dearly beloved, and with the Lord’s help strive to
fulfil to the best of your ability the things before mentioned.—Given on
the first day of July, in the consulship of the most illustrious
Maximinus (or, Maximus) and Africanus. <span
