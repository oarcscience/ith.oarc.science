<span id="vi.iv.xxii.ii-Page_331"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.xxii.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II.—The Existence of the Devil
Affirmed.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxii.ii-p2"></span>“Do you maintain that there is any
prince of evil or not? <span id="fr_1402"></span>[1403](#fn_1402.md)   For
if you say that there is not, I can prove to you from many statements,
and those too of your teacher, that there is; but if you honestly allow
that the evil one exists, then I shall speak in accordance with this
belief.”  And Peter said:  “It is impossible for me to deny the
assertion of my Teacher.  Wherefore I allow that the evil one exists,
because my Teacher, who spoke the truth in all things, has frequently
asserted that he exists.  For instance, then, he acknowledges that he
conversed with Him, and tempted Him for forty days. <span
id="fr_1403"></span>[1404](#fn_1403.md)  And I know that He has said
somewhere else, ‘If Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against
himself:  how then is his kingdom to stand?’ <span
id="fr_1404"></span>[1405](#fn_1404.md)   And He pointed out that He saw
the evil one like lightning falling down from heaven. <span
id="fr_1405"></span>[1406](#fn_1405.md)   And elsewhere He said, ‘He who
sowed the bad seed is the devil.’ <span
id="fr_1406"></span>[1407](#fn_1406.md)   And again, ‘Give no pretext to
the evil one.’ <span id="fr_1407"></span>[1408](#fn_1407.md)   Moreover, in
giving advice, He said, ‘Let your yea be yea, and your nay nay; for what
is more than these is of the evil one.’ <span
id="fr_1408"></span>[1409](#fn_1408.md)   Also, in the prayer which He
delivered to us, we have it said, ‘Deliver us from the evil one.’ <span
id="fr_1409"></span>[1410](#fn_1409.md)   And in another place, He promised
that He would say to those who are impious, ‘Go ye into outer darkness,
which the Father prepared for the devil and his angels.’ <span
id="fr_1410"></span>[1411](#fn_1410.md)   And not to prolong this statement
further, I know that my Teacher often said that there is an evil one. 
Wherefore I also agree in thinking that he exists.  If, then, in future
you have anything to say in accordance with this belief, say it, as you
promised.”
