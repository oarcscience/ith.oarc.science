id="vi.iii.iv.lv-p1.1"></span>Chapter LV.—Simon’s Objections Turned
Against Himself.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iv.lv-p2"></span>Peter answered:  “O Simon, they are
wont to conceive such absurdities against God who do not read the law
with the instruction of masters, but account themselves teachers, and
think that they can understand the law, though he has not explained it
to them who has learned of the Master. <span
id="fr_664"></span>[665](#fn_664.md)   Nevertheless now, that we also may
seem to follow the book of the law according to your apprehension of it;
inasmuch as you say that the creator of the world is shown to be both
impotent and evil, how is it that you do not see that that power of
yours, which you say is superior to all, fails and lies under the very
same charges?  For the very same thing may be said of it, that it is
either powerless, since it does not correct those things which here are
done amiss; or if it can and will not, it is evil; or if it neither can
nor will, then it is both impotent and imperfect.  Whence that new power
of yours is not only found liable to a similar charge, but even to a
worse one, if, in addition to all these things, it is believed to be,
when it is not.  For He who created the world, His existence is manifest
by His very operation in creating the world, as you yourself also
confess.  But this power which you say that you alone know, affords no
indication of itself, by which we might perceive, at least, that it is,
and subsists.”
