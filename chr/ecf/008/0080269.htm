<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.v.lix-p2"></A>Having therefore separated me, Clement, and Niceta and Aquila, he said to those twelve:&#160; &#8220;I wish you the day after to-morrow to proceed to the Gentiles, and to follow in the footsteps of Simon, that you may inform me of all his proceedings.&#160; You will also inquire diligently the sentiments of every one, and announce to them that I shall come to them without delay; and, in short, in all places instruct the Gentiles to expect my coming.&#8221;&#160; When he had spoken these things, and others to the same effect, he said:&#160; &#8220;You also, my brethren, if you have anything to say to these things, say on, lest haply it be not right which seems good to me alone.&#8221;&#160; Then all, with one voice applauding him, said:&#160; &#8220;We ask you rather to arrange everything according to your own judgment, and to order what seems good to yourself; for this we think to be the perfect work of piety, if we fulfil what you command.&#8221;</p>
