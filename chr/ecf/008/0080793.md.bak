<span id="vi.iv.viii.vi-p2"></span>“Then said I:  ‘Are those things
correct, then, which are spoken by poets and philosophers, that in Hades
the souls of the wicked are judged and punished for their attempts; such
as those of Ixion, and Tantalus, and Tityus, and Sisyphus, and the
daughters of Danaus, and as many others as have been impious here?  And
how, if these things are not so, is it possible that magic can
subsist?’  Then he having told me that these things are so in Hades, I
asked him:  ‘Why are not we ourselves afraid of magic, being persuaded
of the punishment in Hades for adultery?  For I do not admit that it is
a righteous thing to compel to adultery a woman who is unwilling; but if
any one will engage to persuade her, I am ready for that, besides
confessing my thanks.’
