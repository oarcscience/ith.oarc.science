<span id="vi.iv.xxiii.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.xxiii.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter IX.—Why the Wicked One is
Appointed Over the Wicked by the Righteous God.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxiii.ix-p2"></span>When Peter said this, Lazarus, who
also was one of his followers, said:  “Explain to us the harmony, how it
can be reasonable that the wicked one should be appointed by the
righteous God to be the punisher of the impious, and yet should himself
afterwards be sent into lower darkness along with his angels and with
sinners:  for I remember that the Teacher Himself said this.” <span
id="fr_1513"></span>[1514](#fn_1513)   And Peter said:  “I indeed allow
that the evil one does no evil, inasmuch as he is accomplishing the law
given to him.  And although he has an evil disposition, yet through fear
of God he does nothing unjustly; but, accusing the teachers of truth so
as to entrap the unwary, he is himself named the accuser (the devil). 
But the statement of our unerring Teacher, that he and his angels, along
with the deluded sinners, shall go into lower darkness, admits of the
following explanation.  The evil one, having obtained the lot <span
id="fr_1514"></span>[1515](#fn_1514) of rejoicing in darkness according
to his composition, delights to go down to the darkness of Tartarus
along with angels who are his fellow-slaves; for darkness is dear to
fire.  But the souls of men, being drops of pure light, are absorbed by
the substance fire, which is of a different class; and not possessing a
nature capable of dying, they are punished according to their deserts. 
But if he who is the leader of men <span
id="fr_1515"></span>[1516](#fn_1515) into vice is not sent into
darkness, as not rejoicing in it, then his composition, which rejoices
in evils, cannot be changed by another combination into the disposition
for good.  And thus he will be adjudged to be with the good, <span
id="fr_1516"></span>[1517](#fn_1516) all the more because, having
obtained a composition which rejoices in evils, through fear of God he
has done nothing contrary to the decrees of the law of God.  And did not
the Scripture by a mysterious hint <span
id="fr_1517"></span>[1518](#fn_1517) point out by the statement <span
id="fr_1518"></span>[1519](#fn_1518) that the rod of the high priest
Aaron became a serpent, and was again converted into a rod, that a
change in the composition of the wicked one would afterwards take
place?”
