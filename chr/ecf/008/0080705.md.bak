id="vi.iv.vi.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.—Adam Not Ignorant.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.vi.xviii-p2"></span>“Be not deceived.  Our father was
ignorant of nothing; since, indeed, even the law publicly current,
though charging him with the crime of ignorance for the sake of the
unworthy, sends to him those desirous of knowledge, saying, ‘Ask your
father, and he will tell you; your elders, and they will declare to
you.’ <span id="fr_959"></span>[960](#fn_959.md)   This father, these
elders ought to be inquired of.  But you have not inquired whose is the
time of the kingdom, and whose is the seat of prophecy, though He
Himself points out Himself, saying, ‘The <span id="page_242">p.
242</span> <span id="vi.iv.vi.xviii-Page_242"></span>scribes and the
Pharisees sit in Moses’ seat; all things whatsoever they say to you,
hear them.’ <span id="fr_960"></span>[961](#fn_960.md)   Hear *them*, He
said, as entrusted with the key of the kingdom, which is knowledge,
which alone can open the gate of life, through which alone is the
entrance to eternal life.  But truly, He says, they possess the key, but
those wishing to enter they do not suffer to do so.
