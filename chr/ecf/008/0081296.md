<span id="vii.xiv.viii-p2"></span>While Hades was thus discoursing to
Satan, the King of glory stretched out His right hand, and took hold of
our forefather Adam, and raised him.  Then turning also to the rest, He
said:  Come all with me, as many as have died through the tree which he
touched:  for, behold, I again raise you all up through the tree of the
cross.  Thereupon He brought them all out, and our forefather Adam
seemed to be filled with joy, and said:  I thank Thy majesty, O Lord,
that Thou hast brought me up out of the lowest Hades. <span
id="fr_1947"></span>[1948](#fn_1947.md)   Likewise also all the prophets
and the saints said:  We thank Thee, O Christ, Saviour of the world,
that Thou hast brought our life up out of destruction. <span
id="fr_1948"></span>[1949](#fn_1948.md)

<span id="vii.xiv.viii-p5"></span>And after they had thus spoken, the
Saviour blessed Adam with the sign of the cross on his forehead, and did
this also to the patriarchs, and prophets, and martyrs, and forefathers;
and He took them, and sprang up out of Hades.  And while He was going,
the holy fathers accompanying Him sang praises, saying:  Blessed is He
that cometh in the name of the Lord: <span
id="fr_1949"></span>[1950](#fn_1949.md)   Alleluia; to Him be the glory of
all the saints.
