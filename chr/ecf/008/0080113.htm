<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.iii.li-p2"></A>&#8220;Him, therefore, has God appointed in the end of the world; because it was impossible that the evils of men could be removed by any other, provided that the nature of the human race were to remain entire, i.e., the liberty of the will being preserved.&#160; This condition, therefore, being preserved inviolate, He came to invite to His kingdom all righteous ones, and those who have been desirous to please Him.&#160; For these He has prepared unspeakable good things, and the heavenly city Jerusalem, which shall shine above the brightness of the sun, for the habitation of the saints.&#160; But the unrighteous, and the wicked and those who have despised God, and have devoted the life given them to diverse wickednesses, and have given to the practice of evil the time which was given them for the work of righteousness He shall hand over to fitting and condign vengeance.&#160; But the rest of the things which shall then be done, it is neither in the power of angels nor of men to tell or to describe.&#160; This only it is enough for us to know, that God shall confer upon the good an eternal possession of good things.&#8221;</p>
