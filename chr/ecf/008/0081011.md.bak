the Mother.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xvi.vi-p2"></span>The sons, on hearing their mother thus
speak, could no longer, in obedience to the exhortation of Peter,
restrain themselves, but rising up, they clasped her in their arms,
showering down upon her tears and kisses.  But she said:  “What is the
meaning of this?”  And Peter answered:  “Courageously summon up your
spirits, O woman, that you may enjoy your children; for these are
Faustinus and Faustinianus, your sons, who, you said, had perished in
the deep.  For how they are alive, after they had in your opinion died
on that most disastrous night, and how one of them now bears the name of
Nicetas, and the other that of Aquila, they will themselves be able to
tell you; for we, as well as you, have yet to learn this.”  When Peter
thus spoke, my mother fainted away through her excessive joy, and was
like to die.  But when we had revived her she sat up, and coming to
herself, she said:  “Be so good, my darling children, as tell us what
happened to you after that disastrous night.”
