Aradus.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.ix.xxiv-p2"></span>Then Peter, so far as he could, and
as time permitted, addressed the crowds on the faith of God, and the
ordinances of religion; and then added, that if any one wished to know
more accurately about these things, he should come to Antioch, “where,”
said he, “we have resolved to stay three months, and to teach fully the
things which pertain to salvation.  For if,” said he, “men leave their
country and their parents for commercial or military purposes, and do
not fear to undertake long voyages, why should it be thought burdensome
or difficult to leave home for three months for the sake of eternal
life?”  When he had said these things, and more to the same purpose, I
presented a thousand drachmas to the woman who had entertained my
mother, and who had recovered her health by means of Peter, and in the
presence of all committed her to the charge of a certain good man, the
chief person in that town, who promised that he would <span

I also distributed a little money among some others, and among those
women who were said formerly to have comforted my mother in her
miseries, to whom I also expressed my thanks.  And after this we sailed,
along with my mother, to Antaradus.
