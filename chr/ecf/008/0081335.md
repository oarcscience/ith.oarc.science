id="vii.xvii.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 3 (19).</span>

<span id="vii.xvii.iii-p2"></span>Then Satan said to Hades:  Make
thyself ready to receive him whom I shall bring down to thee.  Thereupon
Hades thus replied to Satan:  That voice was from nothing else than the
cry of the Son of the Father most high, because the earth and all the
places of the world below so trembled under it:  wherefore I think that
myself and all my dungeons are now lying open.  But I adjure thee,
Satan, head of all evils, <span id="fr_2006"></span>[2007](#fn_2006) by
thy power and my own, bring him not to me, lest, while we wish to take
him, we be taken captive by him.  For if, at his voice only, all my
power has been thus destroyed, what do you think he will do when he
shall come in person?

<span id="vii.xvii.iii-p4"></span>To him Satan, the leader of death,
thus replied:  What art thou crying out about?  Do not be afraid, my old
most wicked friend, because I have stirred up the people of the Jews
against him; I have told them to strike him with blows on the face, and
I have brought upon him betrayal by one of his disciples; and he is a
man in great fear of death, because from fear he said, My soul is
sorrowful, even unto death; and I have brought him to this, that he has
just been lifted up and hanged on the cross.

<span id="vii.xvii.iii-p5"></span>Then Hades said to him:  If he be the
same who, by the mere word of his command, made Lazarus fly away like an
eagle from my bosom, when he had already been dead four days, he is not
a man in humanity, but God in majesty.  I entreat thee not to bring him
to me.  And Satan says to him:  Make thyself ready nevertheless; be not
afraid; because he is already hanging on the cross, I can do nothing
else.  Then Hades thus replied to Satan:  If, then, thou canst do
nothing else, behold, thy destruction is at hand.  I, in short, shall
remain cast down and dishonoured; thou, however, wilt be tortured under
my power.
