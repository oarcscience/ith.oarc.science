id="vi.iii.viii.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI.—God to Be Loved More Than
Parents.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.viii.vi-p2"></span>“Then let us consider carefully, in
the next place, what reason we have for loving our parents.  For this
cause, it is said, we love them, because they seem to be the authors of
our life.  But our parents are not authors of our life, but means of
it.  For they do not bestow life, but afford the means of our entering
into this life; while the one and sole author of life is God.  If,
therefore we would love the Author of our life, let us know that it is
He that is to be loved.  But then it is said, We cannot know Him; but
them we know, and hold in affection.  Be it so:  you cannot know *what*
God is, but you can very easily know what God is *not*.  For how can any
man fail to know that wood, or stone, or brass, or other such matter, is
not God?  But if you will not give your mind to consider the things
which you might easily apprehend, it is certain that you are hindered in
the knowledge of God, not by impossibility, but by indolence; for if you
had wished it, even from these useless images you might have been set on
the way of understanding.
