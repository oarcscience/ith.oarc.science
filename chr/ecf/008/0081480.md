</span>

<span id="ix.xiii.x-p3"></span>Reign of Sanadroug; murder of Abgar’s
children; the princess Helena.

<span id="ix.xiii.x-p4"></span>Sanadroug, being on the throne, raises
troops with the help of the brave Pacradouni and Ardzrouni, who had
exalted him, and goes to wage war upon the children of Abgar, to make
him self master of the whole kingdom.  Whilst Sanadroug was occupied
with these affairs, as if by an effect of divine providence vengeance
was taken for the death of Attæus; for a marble column which the son of
Abgar was having erected at Edessa, on the summit of his palace, while
he was underneath to direct the work, escaped from the hands of the
workmen, fell upon him and crushed his feet.

<span id="ix.xiii.x-p5"></span>Immediately there came a message from the
inhabitants of the town, asking Sanadroug for a treaty by which he
should engage not to disturb them in the exercise of the Christian
religion, in consideration of which, they would give up the town and the
king’s treasures.  Sanadroug promised, but in the end violated his
oath.  Sanadroug put all the children of the house of Abgar to the edge
of the sword, with the exception of the daughters, whom he withdrew from
the town to place them in the canton of Hachdiank.  As to the first of
Abgar’s wives, named Helena, he sent her to his town at Kharan, and left
to her the sovereignty of the whole of Mesopotamia, in remembrance of
the benefits he had received from Abgar by Helena’s means.

<span id="ix.xiii.x-p6"></span>Helena, pious like her husband Abgar, did
not wish to live in the midst of idolaters; she went away to Jerusalem
in the time of Claudius, during the famine which Agabus had predicted;
with all her treasures she bought in Egypt an immense quantity of corn,
which she distributed <span id="page_707">p. 707</span> <span
id="ix.xiii.x-Page_707"></span>amongst the poor, a fact to which
Josephus testifies. Helena’s tomb, a truly remarkable one, is still to
be seen before the gate of Jerusalem.
