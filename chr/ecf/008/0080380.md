<span id="vi.iii.ix.xiii-p2"></span>But when Peter had admired only the
columns, being no wise ravished with the grace of the painting, he went
out, and saw before the gates a poor woman asking alms of those who went
in; and looking earnestly at her, he said:  “Tell me, O woman, what
member of your body is wanting, that you subject yourself to the
indignity of asking alms, and do not rather gain your bread by labouring
with your hands which God has given you.”  But she, sighing, said: 
“Would that I had hands which could be moved; but now only the
appearance of hands has been preserved, for they are lifeless, and have
been rendered feeble and without feeling by my knawing of them.”  Then
Peter said:  “What has been the cause of your inflicting so great an
injury upon yourself?”  “Want of courage,” said she, “and nought else;
for if I had had any bravery in me, I could either have thrown myself
from a precipice, or cast myself into the depths of the sea, and so
ended my griefs.”
