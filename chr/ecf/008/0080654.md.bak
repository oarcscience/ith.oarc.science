Associates with Simon.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.v.xxi-p2"></span>“These men having fallen in with
Zacchæus, who sojourned here, and having received the word of truth from
him, and having repented of their former innovations, and immediately
denouncing Simon as being privy with him in all things, as soon as I
came to sojourn here, they came to me with their foster-mother, being
presented to me by him, *Zacchæus*, and ever since they continue with
me, enjoying instructions in the truth.”  When Peter had said this, he
sent for them, and charged them that they should accurately relate to me
all things concerning Simon.  And they, having called God to witness
that in nothing they would falsify, proceeded with the relation.
