<span id="vi.iv.xvi.xxi-p2"></span>“Much better is it, then, that your
first circumstances should be distressing.  For when this is the case,
they do not so deeply grieve you, because you hope that they will pass
away, and they yield joy though the expectation of better
circumstances.  But, above all, I wish you to know how much chastity is
pleasing to God.  The chaste woman is God’s choice, God’s good pleasure,
God’s glory, God’s child.  So great a blessing is chastity, <span
id="fr_1187"></span>[1188](#fn_1187) that if there had not been a law
that not even a righteous person should enter into the kingdom of God
unbap<span id="page_305">p. 305</span> <span
id="vi.iv.xvi.xxi-Page_305"></span>tized, perhaps even the erring
Gentiles might have been saved solely on account of chastity.  Wherefore
I am exceedingly sorry for those erring ones who are chaste because they
shrink from baptism—thus choosing to be chaste without good hope. 
Wherefore they are not saved; for the decree of God is clearly set down,
that an unbaptized person cannot enter into His kingdom.”  When he said
this, and much more, we turned to sleep.

Wieseler’s.  The emendation is questionable; but the sense is the best
that can be got out of the words.
