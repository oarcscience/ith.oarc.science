Conference.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.v.liii-p2"></span>“But of these and such like things I
shall afford you an explanation in due time.  But for the rest, since,
as you see, the evening has come upon us, let what has been said be
enough for to-day.  But whenever you wish, and about whatever you wish,
ask boldly of us, and we shall gladly explain it at once.”  Thus having
spoken, he rose up.  And then, having partaken of food, we turned to
sleep, for the night had come upon us.
