<span id="vii.xiii.vii-p2"></span>And when Nicodemus had thus spoken,
another Hebrew rose up, and said to Pilate:  I beg of thee, my lord
Pilate, hear me also.  Pilate answered:  Say what thou wishest.  The
Hebrew says:  I lay sick in bed thirty-eight years; and when he saw me
he was grieved, and said to me, Rise, take up thy couch, and go into
thine house.  And while he was saying the word to me, I rose and walked
about.  The Hebrews say:  Ask him on what day of the week this
happened.  He says:  On Sabbath. <span
id="fr_1885"></span>[1886](#fn_1885)   The Jews said:  And consequently
we say truly, that he does not keep the Sabbath.

<span id="vii.xiii.vii-p4"></span>Another, again, standing in the midst,
said:  I was born blind; and as Jesus was going along the road, I cried
to him, saying, Have mercy upon me, Lord, thou son of David.  And he
took clay, and anointed mine eyes; and straightway I received my
sight. <span id="fr_1886"></span>[1887](#fn_1886)   Another said:  I was
crooked; and seeing him, I cried, Have mercy upon me, O Lord.  And he
took me by the hand, and I was immediately raised. <span
id="fr_1887"></span>[1888](#fn_1887)   Another said:  I was a leper, and
he healed me merely by a word. <span
id="fr_1888"></span>[1889](#fn_1888)
