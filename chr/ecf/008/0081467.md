<span id="ix.x-p3"></span><span class="c9"><span id="ix.x-p3.1"></span>I
found</span> at the Armenian Convent of St. Lazarus, near Venice, a
version of the *Letter of Abgar*, translated into French “from the
Armenian version of the fifth century,” and published in 1868, which is
now before me.  It ascribes the original to *Laboubnia*, and adds:  “The
name *Léroubna*, mentioned only by *Moses of Chorène*, was not repeated
after him by any one else, save, perhaps, *Mekhitar d’Aïrivank* (one of
our chroniclers of the thirteenth century), who puts him among our
historians, between *Tatien* and *Mar Ibas Gadina*, but without
affirming whether he knew him only by name or also by his writings.” 
The editor goes on to speak of his correspondence with Dr. Cureton
(<span class="c9"><span id="ix.x-p3.2"></span>a.d.</span> 1864) which is
referred to in note 4, p. 665, *supra*.  He notes the incomplete and
mutilated character of the Syriac copies used by Cureton, and
congratulates himself on the entire and integral condition of the
Armenian, which he found in 1852 in the Imperial Library at Paris, as
*Codex No. 88, <span class="c9"><span id="ix.x-p3.3"></span>mss.</span>
Armen*.  Here the name of the author is given as *Laboubnia*, and agrees
with the Syriac.  The interpolations he regards as made after the fourth
century.
