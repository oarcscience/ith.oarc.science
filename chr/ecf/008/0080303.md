id="vi.iii.vi.xxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVII.—Ham the First
Magician.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.vi.xxvii-p2"></span>“For these and some other causes, a
flood was brought upon the world, <span
id="fr_739"></span>[740](#fn_739) as we have said already, and shall say
again; and all who were upon the earth were destroyed, except the family
of Noah, who survived, with his three sons and their wives.  One of
these, by name Ham, unhappily discovered the magical act, and handed
down the instruction of it to one of his sons, who was called Mesraim,
from whom the race of the Egyptians and Babylonians and Persians are
descended.  Him the nations who then existed called Zoroaster, <span
id="fr_740"></span>[741](#fn_740) admiring him as the first author of
the magic art; under whose name also many books on this subject exist. 
He therefore, being much and frequently intent upon the stars, and
wishing to be esteemed a god among them, began to draw forth, as it
were, certain sparks from the stars, and to show them to men, in order
that the rude and ignorant might be astonished, as with a miracle; and
desiring to increase this estimation of him, he attempted these things
again and again, until he was set on fire, and consumed by the demon
himself, whom he accosted with too great importunity.
