id="vi.iii.iv.lxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter LXVII.—The Law Teaches of
Immensity.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iv.lxvii-p2"></span>Then said Peter:  “If you believed
concerning the true fountain of light, I could instruct you what and of
what sort is that which is immense, and should render, not a vain fancy,
but a consistent and necessary account of the truth, and should make
use, not of sophistical assertions, but testimonies of the law and
nature, that you might know that the law especially contains what we
ought to believe in regard to immensity.  But if the doctrine of
immensity is not unknown to the law, then assuredly, nought else can be
unknown to it; and therefore it is a false supposition of yours, that
there is anything of which the law is not cognisant.  Much more shall
nothing be unknown to Him who gave the law.  Yet I cannot speak anything
to you of immensity and of those things which are without limit, unless
first you either accept our account of those heavens which are bounded
by a certain limit, or else propound your own account of them.  But if
you cannot understand concerning those which are comprehended within
fixed boundaries, much more can you neither know nor learn anything
concerning those which are without limit.”
