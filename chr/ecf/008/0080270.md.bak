id="vi.iii.v.lx-p1.1"></span>Chapter LXX.—Departure of the
Twelve.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.v.lx-p2"></span>Therefore, on the day appointed, when
they had ranged themselves before Peter, they said:  “Do not think, O
Peter, that it is a small grief to us that we are to be deprived of the
privilege of hearing you for three months; but since it is <span
id="page_133">p. 133</span> <span id="vi.iii.v.lx-Page_133"></span>good
for us to do what you order, we shall most readily obey.  We shall
always retain in our hearts the remembrance of your face; and so we set
out actively, as you have commanded us.”  Then he, having poured out a
prayer to the Lord for them, dismissed them.  And when those twelve who
had been sent forward had gone, Peter entered, according to custom, and
stood in the place of disputation.  And a multitude of people had come
together, even a larger number than usual; and all with tears gazed upon
him, by reason of what they had heard from him the day before, that he
was about to go forth on account of Simon.  Then, seeing them weeping,
he himself also was similarly affected, although he endeavoured to
conceal and to restrain his tears.  But the trembling of his voice, and
the interruption of his discourse, betrayed that he was distressed by
similar emotion.
