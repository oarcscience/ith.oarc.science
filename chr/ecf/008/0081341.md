<span id="vii.xvii.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vii.xvii.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 9 (25).</span>

<span id="vii.xvii.ix-p2"></span>Then the Lord Jesus, the Saviour of
all, affectionate and most mild, saluting Adam kindly, said to him: 
Peace be to thee, Adam, with thy children, through immeasurable ages of
ages!  Amen.  Then father Adam, falling forward at the feet of the Lord,
and being raised erect, kissed His hands, and shed many tears, saying,
testifying to all:  Behold the hands which fashioned me!  And he said to
the Lord:  Thou hast come, O King of glory, delivering men, and bringing
them into Thy everlasting kingdom.  Then also our mother Eve in like
manner fell forward at the feet of our Lord, and was raised erect, and
kissed His hands, and poured forth tears in abundance, and <span
id="page_458">p. 458</span> <span id="vii.xvii.ix-Page_458"></span>said,
testifying to all:  Behold the hands which made me!

<span id="vii.xvii.ix-p3"></span>Then all the saints, adoring Him, cried
out, saying:  Blessed is He who cometh in the name of the Lord!  The
Lord God hath shone upon us—amen—through all ages.  Alleluia for ever
and ever!  Praise, honour, power, glory! because Thou hast come from on
high to visit us.  Singing Alleluia continually, and rejoicing together
concerning His glory, they ran together under the hands of the Lord. 
Then the Saviour, inquiring thoroughly about all, seized Hades, <span

Tartarus, and led some with Him to the upper world.

Hades, for <span class="Greek"><span
