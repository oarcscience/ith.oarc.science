Such as I Am.”</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xii.xx-p2"></span>“Do not then suppose that we do not
fear demons on this account, that we are of a different nature *from
you*.  For we are of the same nature, but not of the same worship. 
Wherefore, being not only much but altogether superior to you, we do not
grudge you becoming such *as we are*; but, on the other hand, counsel
you, knowing that all these *demons* beyond measure honour and fear
those who are reconciled to God.”
