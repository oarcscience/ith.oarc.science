id="x.vi.ii.ii-p1.1"></span>Concerning the Relatives of Our
Saviour. <span id="fr_3697"></span>[3698](#fn_3697) </span>

<span id="x.vi.ii.ii-p3"></span>There still survived of the kindred of
the Lord the grandsons of Judas, who according to the flesh was called
his brother.  These were informed against, as belonging to the family of
David, and Evocatus brought them before Domitian Cæsar:  for *that
emperor* dreaded the advent of Christ, as Herod had done.

<span id="x.vi.ii.ii-p4"></span>So he asked them whether they were of
*the family of* David; and they confessed they were.  Next he asked them
what property they had, or how much money they possessed.  They both
replied that they had only 9000 *denaria between them*, each of them
owning half that sum; but even this they said they did not possess in
cash, but as the estimated value of some land, consisting of thirty-nine
*plethra* only, out of which they had to pay the dues, and that they
supported themselves by their own labour.  And then they began to hold
out their hands, exhibiting, as proof of their manual labour, the
roughness of their skin, and the corns raised on their hands by constant
work.

<span id="x.vi.ii.ii-p5"></span>Being then asked concerning Christ and
His kingdom, what was its nature, and when and where it was to appear,
they returned answer that it was not of this world, nor of the earth,
but belonging to the sphere of heaven and angels, and would make its
appearance at the end of time, when He shall come in glory, and judge
living and dead, and render to every one according to the course of his
life. <span id="fr_3698"></span>[3699](#fn_3698)

<span id="x.vi.ii.ii-p7"></span>Thereupon Domitian passed no
condemnation upon them, but treated them with contempt, as too mean for
notice, and let them go free.  At the same time he issued a command, and
put a stop to the persecution against the Church.

<span id="x.vi.ii.ii-p8"></span><span id="page_764">p. 764</span> <span
id="x.vi.ii.ii-Page_764"></span>When they were released they became
leaders <span id="fr_3699"></span>[3700](#fn_3699) of the churches, as
was natural in the case of those who were at once martyrs and of the
kindred of the Lord.  And, after the establishment of peace *to the
Church*, their lives were prolonged to *the reign of* Trajan.
