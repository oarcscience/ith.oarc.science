id="vi.iv.xxii.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIV.—Is Matter Eternal?</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxii.xiv-p2"></span>And Simon said:  “But what if
matter, being coeval with Him, and possessing equal power, produces as
His foe leaders who hinder His wishes?”  And Peter said:  “If matter is
eternal, then it is the foe of no one:  for that which exists for ever
is impassible, and what is impassible is blessed; but what is blessed
cannot be receptive of hatred, since, on account of its eternal
creation, <span id="fr_1432"></span>[1433](#fn_1432.md) it does not fear
that it will be deprived of anything.  But how does not matter rather
love the Creator, when <span id="fr_1433"></span>[1434](#fn_1433.md) it
evidently sends forth its fruits to nourish all who are made by Him? 
And how does it not fear Him as superior, as trembling through
earthquakes it confesses, and as, though its billows ran high, yet, when
the Teacher was sailing on it and commanded a calm, it immediately
obeyed and became still? <span id="fr_1434"></span>[1435](#fn_1434.md)  
What! did not the demons go out through fear and respect for Him, and
others of them desired to enter into swine; but they first entreated Him
before going, plainly because they had no power to enter even into swine
without His permission?” <span id="fr_1435"></span>[1436](#fn_1435.md)

instead of “eternal creation.”
