<p class="c22"><a name="vii.x.i-p5"></A>And as He was walking through a field of corn, He stretched forth His hand, and took of the ears, and put them over the fire, and rubbed them, and began to eat.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.x.i-p6"></A>And when they had come into Egypt, they received hospitality in the house of a certain widow, and they remained in the same place one year.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.x.i-p7"></A>And Jesus was in His third year.&#160; And seeing boys playing, He began to play with them.&#160; And He took a dried fish, and put it into a basin, and ordered it to move about.&#160; And it began to move about.&#160; And He said again to the fish:&#160; Throw out thy salt which thou hast, and walk into the water.&#160; And it so came to pass.&#160; And the neighbours, seeing what had been done, told it to the widow woman in whose house Mary His mother lived.&#160; And as soon as she heard it, she thrust them out of her house with great haste.</p>
