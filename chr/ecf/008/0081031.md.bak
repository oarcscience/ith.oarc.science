id="vi.iv.xvii.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.—Peter’s Arguments Against
Genesis.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xvii.iv-p2"></span>“And I said:  ‘If all things are
subject to Genesis, and you are fully convinced that this is the case,
your thoughts and advice are contrary to your own opinion. <span
id="fr_1197"></span>[1198](#fn_1197.md)   For if it is impossible even to
think in opposition to Genesis, why do you toil in vain, advising me to
do what cannot be done?  Yea, moreover, even if Genesis subsists, do not
make haste to prevail on me not to worship Him who is also Lord of the
stars, by whose wish that a thing should not take place, that thing
becomes an impossibility.  For always that which is subject must obey
that which rules.  As far, however, as the worship of the common gods is
concerned, that is superfluous, if Genesis has sway.  For neither does
anything happen contrary to what seems good to fate, nor are they
themselves able to do anything, since they are subject to their own
universal Genesis.  If Genesis exists, there is this objection to it,
that that which is not first has the rule; or, *in other words*, the
uncreated cannot be subject, for the uncreated, as being uncreated, has
nothing that is older than itself.’ <span

contrary to yourself.”

<span id="vi.iv.xvii.iv-p4"></span> The argument here is obscure. 
Probably what is intended is as follows:  Genesis means origination,
coming into being.  Origination cannot be the ruling power, for there
must be something unoriginated which has given rise to the origination. 
The origination, therefore, as not being first, cannot have sway, and it
must itself be subject to that which is unoriginated.
