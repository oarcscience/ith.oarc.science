id="vi.iv.v.xl-p1.1"></span>Chapter XL.—Preliminary Instruction.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.v.xl-p2"></span>“Everything that is spoken or written
against God is false.  But that we say this truly, not only for the sake
of reputation, but for the sake of truth, I shall convince you when my
discourse has proceeded a little further.  Whence you, my most beloved
Clement, ought not to be sorry at Simon’s having interposed a day
between this and the discussion.  For to-day, before the discussion, you
shall be instructed concerning the chapters added to the Scriptures; and
then in the discussion concerning the only one and good God, the Maker
also of the world, you ought not to be distracted.  But in the
discussion you will even wonder how impious men, overlooking the
multitudes of things that are spoken in the Scriptures for God, and
looking at those that are spoken against Him, gladly bring these
forward; and thus the hearers, by reason of ignorance, believing the
things against God, become outcasts from His kingdom.  Wherefore you, by
advantage of the postponement, learning the mystery of the Scriptures,
and gaining the *means of* not sinning against God, will incomparably
rejoice.”
