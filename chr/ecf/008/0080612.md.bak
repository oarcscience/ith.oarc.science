<span id="vi.iv.iv.ii-p2"></span>As I pondered without ceasing these and
such like questions—I know not whence arising—I had such bitter grief,
that, becoming pale, I wasted away; and, what was most terrible, if at
any time I wished to drive away this meditation as unprofitable, my
suffering became all the more severe; and I grieved over this, not
knowing that I had a fair inmate, even my thought, which was to be to me
the cause of a blessed immortality, as I afterwards knew by experience,
and gave thanks to God, the Lord of all.  For it was by this thought,
which at first afflicted me, that I was compelled to come to the search
and the finding of things; and then I pitied those whom at first,
through ignorance, I ventured to call blessed.
