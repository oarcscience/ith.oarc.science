id="vi.iv.iv.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIX.—The True Prophet.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xix-p2"></span>“Now the Man who is the helper I call
the true Prophet; and He alone is able to enlighten the souls of men, so
that with our own eyes we may be able to see the way of eternal
salvation.  But otherwise it is impossible, as you also know, since you
said a little while ago that every doctrine is set up and pulled down,
and the same is <span id="page_228">p. 228</span> <span
id="vi.iv.iv.xix-Page_228"></span>thought true or false, according to
the power of him who advocates it; so that doctrines do not appear as
they are, but take the appearance of being or not being truth or
falsehood from those who advocate them. <span
id="fr_913"></span>[914](#fn_913.md)   On this account the whole business
of religion needed a true prophet, that he might tell us things that
are, as they are, and how we must believe concerning all things.  So
that it is first necessary to test the prophet by every prophetic sign,
and having ascertained that he is true, thereafter to believe him in
every thing, and not to sit in judgment upon his several sayings, but to
receive them as certain, being accepted indeed by seeming faith, yet by
sure judgment.  For by our initial proof, and by strict inquiry on every
side, all things are received with right reason.  Wherefore before all
things it is necessary to seek after the true Prophet, because without
Him it is impossible that any certainty can come to men.”
