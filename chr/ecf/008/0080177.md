id="vi.iii.iv.xl-p1.1"></span>Chapter XL.—Peter’s Answer.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iv.xl-p2"></span>When Peter had heard this, he
answered:  “Fear nothing, Simon:  for, behold, we have neither shut our
ears, nor fled; but we answer with words of truth to those things which
you have spoken falsely, asserting this first, that there is one God,
even the God of the Jews, who is the only God, the Creator of heaven and
earth, who is also the God of all those whom you call gods.  If, then, I
shall show you that none is superior to Him, but that He Himself is
above all, you will confess that your error is above all.” <span
id="fr_638"></span>[639](#fn_638)   Then Simon said:  “Why, indeed,
though I should be unwilling to confess it, would not the hearers who
stand by charge me with unwillingness to profess the things that are
true?”

<span id="vi.iii.iv.xl-p3"></span> \[The reply of Peter here is of a
higher character than that given in the *Homilies* (see iii. 40, etc.). 
Indeed, the report of the entire discussion in the *Recognitions* shows
a superior conception of the Apostle.—R.\]
