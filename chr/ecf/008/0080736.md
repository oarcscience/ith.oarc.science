id="vi.iv.vi.xlix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLIX.—The True Prophet.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.vi.xlix-p2"></span>Then Peter said:  “I shall tell you
forthwith.  It is written in the first book of the law, towards the
end:  ‘A ruler shall not fail from Judah, nor a leader from his thighs,
until He come whose it is; and He is the expectation of the
nations.’ <span id="fr_990"></span>[991](#fn_990)   If, therefore, any
one can apprehend Him who came after the failure of ruler and leader
from Judah, and who was to be expected by the nations, he will be able
by this verse to recognise Him as truly having come; <span
id="fr_991"></span>[992](#fn_991) and believing His teaching, he will
know what of the Scriptures are true and what are false.”  Then said
Simon:  “I understand that you speak of your Jesus as Him who was
prophesied of by the scripture.  Therefore let it be granted that it is
so.  Tell us, then, how he taught you to discriminate the Scriptures.”
