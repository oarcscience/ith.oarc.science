<span id="vi.iii.vi.xxxii-p2"></span>“Wherefore begin now with better
understanding to resist yourselves in those things which you do not
rightly desire; <span id="fr_741"></span>[742](#fn_741.md) if so be that
you can in any way repair and restore in yourselves that purity of
religion and innocence of life which at first were bestowed upon man by
God, that thereby also the hope of immortal blessings may be restored to
you.  And give thanks to the bountiful Father of all, by Him whom He has
constituted King of peace, and the treasury of unspeakable honours, that
even at the present time your sins may be washed away with the water of
the fountain, or river, or even sea:  the threefold name of blessedness
being called over you, that by it not only evil spirits may be driven
out, if any dwell in you, but also that, when you have forsaken your
sins, and have with entire faith and entire purity of mind believed in
God, you may drive out wicked spirits and demons from others also, and
may be able <span id="page_142">p. 142</span> <span
id="vi.iii.vi.xxxii-Page_142"></span>to set others free from sufferings
and sicknesses.  For the demons themselves know and acknowledge those
who have given themselves up to God, and sometimes they are driven out
by the mere presence of such, as you saw a little while ago, how, when
we had only addressed to you the word of salutation, straightway the
demons, on account of their respect for our religion, began to cry out,
and could not bear our presence even for a little.
