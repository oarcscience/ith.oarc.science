<span id="vi.iii.xi.xxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iii.xi.xxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVIII.—Jewish Customs.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.xi.xxviii-p2"></span>“I shall add another thing which
may satisfy even the most incredulous.  All the Jews who live under the
law of Moses circumcise their sons on the eighth day without fail, and
shed the blood of the tender infant.  But no one of the Gentiles has
ever submitted to this on the eighth day; and, on the other hand, no one
of the Jews has ever omitted it.  How then shall the account of <span
class="c9"><span id="vi.iii.xi.xxviii-p2.1"></span>Genesis</span> stand
with this, since Jews live in all parts of the world, mixed with
Gentiles, and on the eighth day suffer the cutting of a member?  And no
one of the Gentiles, but only they themselves, as I have said, do this,
induced to it not by the compulsion of any star, nor by the
perfusion <span id="fr_847"></span>[848](#fn_847) of blood, but by the
law of their religion; and in whatever part of the world they are, this
sign is familiar to them.  But also the fact that one name is among them
all, wheresoever they are, does this also come through <span
class="c9"><span id="vi.iii.xi.xxviii-p3.1"></span>Genesis</span>?  And
also that no child born among them is ever exposed, and that on every
seventh day they all rest, wherever they may be, and do not go upon a
journey, and do not use fire? <span id="fr_848"></span>[849](#fn_848)  
Why is it, then, that no one of the Jews is compelled by <span
class="c9"><span id="vi.iii.xi.xxviii-p4.2"></span>Genesis</span> to go
on a journey, or to build, or to sell or buy anything on that day?

<span id="vi.iii.xi.xxviii-p3"></span> Probably we should read
*perfusionem* instead of *perfusione*, and then the translation would
be:  “no star compelling, or even urging on them the shedding of
blood.”  So Whiston translates.
