id="vi.iv.vi.lxx-p1.1"></span>Chapter LXX.—“Hear the Bishop.”</span>

<span id="vi.iv.vi.lxx-p2"></span>“However, hear your bishop, and do not
weary of giving all honour to him; knowing that, by showing it to him,
it is borne to Christ, and from Christ it is borne to God; and to him
who offers it, is requited manifold. <span
id="fr_1027"></span>[1028](#fn_1027.md)   Honour, therefore, the throne of
Christ.  For you are commanded even to honour the chair of Moses, and
that although they who occupy it are accounted sinners. <span
id="fr_1028"></span>[1029](#fn_1028.md)   And now I have said enough to
you; and I deem it superfluous to say to him how he is to live
unblameably, since he is an approved disciple of Him who taught me also.
