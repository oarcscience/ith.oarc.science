Assembling of Yourselves Together.”</span>

<span id="vi.iv.vi.lxix-p2"></span>“But if you love your brethren, take
nothing from them, but share with them such things as ye have.  Feed the
hungry; give drink to the thirsty; clothe the naked; visit the sick; so
far as you can, help those in prison; receive strangers gladly into your
own abodes; hate no one.  And how you must be pious, your own mind will
teach you, judging rightly.  But before all else, if indeed I need say
it to you, come together frequently, if it were every hour, especially
on the appointed days of meeting.  For if you do this, you are within a
wall of safety.  For disorderliness is the beginning of perdition.  Let
no one therefore forsake the assembly on the ground of envy towards a
brother.  For if any one of you forsake the assembly, he shall be
regarded as of those who scatter the Church of Christ, and shall be cast
out with adulterers.  For as an adulterer, under the influence of the
spirit that is in him, he separates himself on some pretext, and gives
place to the wicked one against himself,—a sheep for the stealing, as
one found outside the fold. <span id="fr_1026"></span>[1027](#fn_1026)
