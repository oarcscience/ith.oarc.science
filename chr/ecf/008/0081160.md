id="vi.iv.xxiii.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XV.—The Repentance of
Faustus.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxiii.xv-p2"></span>When my father said this, after no
long time *Annubion came* <span id="fr_1527"></span>[1528](#fn_1527) to
us to announce to us the flight of Simon, and how that very night he had
hurried to Judæa.  And he found our father wailing, and with
lamentations saying:  “Alas, alas! unhappy man!  I did not believe when
I was told that he was a magician.  Miserable man that I am!  I have
been recognised for one day by my wife and children, and have speedily
gone back to my previous sad condition when I was still ignorant.”  And
my mother lamenting, plucked her hair; and we groaned in distress on
account of the transformation of our father, and could not comprehend
what in the world it could be.  But Annubion stood speechless, seeing
and hearing these things; while Peter said to us, his children, in the
presence of all:  “Believe me, this is Faustus your father.  Wherefore I
urge you to attend to him as being your father.  For God will vouchsafe
some occasion for his putting off the shape of Simon, and exhibiting
again distinctly that of your father.”  And saying this, and looking to
my father, he said:  “I permitted you to salute Appion and Annubion,
since you asserted that they were your friends from childhood, but I did
not permit you to associate with the magician Simon.”
