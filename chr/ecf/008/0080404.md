<span id="vi.iii.ix.xxxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iii.ix.xxxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXVII.—Peter
Inexorable.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.ix.xxxvii-p2"></span>Then said Peter: <span
id="fr_800"></span>[801](#fn_800.md)   “Let not the wicked one prevail
against us, taking occasion from a mother’s love; but let you, and me
with you, fast this day along with her, and to-morrow she shall be
baptized:  for it is not right that the precepts of truth be relaxed and
weakened in favour of any person or friendship.  Let us not shrink,
then, from suffering along with her, for it is a sin to transgress any
commandment.  But let us teach our bodily senses, which are without us,
to be in subjection to our inner senses; and not compel our inner
senses, which savour the things that be of God, to follow the outer
senses, which savour the things that be of the flesh.  For to this end
also the Lord commanded, saying:  ‘Whosoever shall look upon a woman to
lust after her, hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.’ 
And to this He added:  ‘If thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and
cast it from thee:  for it is profitable for thee <span id="page_165">p.
165</span> <span id="vi.iii.ix.xxxvii-Page_165"></span>that one of thy
members perish, rather than thy whole body be cast into
hell-fire.’ <span id="fr_801"></span>[802](#fn_801.md)   He does not say,
*has offended thee,* that you should then cast away the cause of sin
after you have sinned; but *if it offend you,* that is, that before you
sin you should cut off the cause of the sin that provokes and irritates
you.  But let none of you think, brethren, that the Lord commended the
cutting off of the members.  His meaning is, that the purpose should be
cut off, not the members, and the causes which allure to sin, in order
that our thought, borne up on the chariot of sight, may push towards the
love of God, supported by the bodily senses; <span
id="fr_802"></span>[803](#fn_802.md) and not give loose reins to the eyes
of the flesh as to wanton horses, eager to turn their running outside
the way of the commandments, but may subject the bodily sight to the
judgment of the mind, and not suffer those eyes of ours, which God
intended to be viewers and witnesses of His work, to become panders of
evil desire.  And therefore let the bodily senses as well as the
internal thought be subject to the law of God, and let them serve His
will, whose work they acknowledge themselves to be.”

<span id="vi.iii.ix.xxxvii-p3"></span> \[In Homily XIII. 12 the Apostle
is represented as thus deferring the baptism; but a longer discourse on
chastity (chaps. 13–21) is given, assigned to the evening of that
day.—R.\]

<span id="vi.iii.ix.xxxvii-p5"></span> Here a marginal reading is
followed.  The reading of the text is:  “In order that our thought,
borne on the chariot of contemplation, may hasten on, invisible to the
bodily senses, towards the love of God.”  But the translation of
*aspectus* by “contemplation” is doubtful.
