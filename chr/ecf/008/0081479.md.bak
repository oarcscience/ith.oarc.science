<span id="ix.xiii.ix-p3"></span>Martyrdom of our apostles.

<span id="ix.xiii.ix-p4"></span>After the death of Abgar, the kingdom of
Armenia was divided between two:  Ananoun, Abgar’s son, reigned at
Edessa, and his sister’s son, Sanadroug, in Armenia.  What took place in
their time has been previously told by others:  the apostle’s arrival in
Armenia, the conversion of Sanadroug and his apostasy for fear of the
Armenian satraps, and the martyrdom of the apostle and his companions in
the canton of Chavarchan, now called Ardaz, and the stone opening to
receive the body of the apostle, and the removal of this body by his
disciples, his burial in the plain, and the martyrdom of the king’s
daughter, Santoukhd, near the road, and the apparition of the remains of
the two saints, and their removal to the rocks—all circumstances related
by others, as we have said, a long time before us:  we have not thought
it important to repeat them here.  In the same way also what is related
of the martyrdom at Edessa of Attæus, a disciple of the apostle, a
martyrdom ordered by Abgar’s son, has been told by others before us.

<span id="ix.xiii.ix-p5"></span>The prince who reigned after the death
of his father, did not inherit his father’s virtues:  he opened the
temples of the idols, and embraced the religion of the heathen.  He sent
word to Attæus:  “Make me a head-dress of cloth interwoven with gold,
like those you formerly used to make for my father.”  He received this
answer from Attæus:  “My hands shall not make a head-dress for an
unworthy prince, who does not worship Christ the living God.”

<span id="ix.xiii.ix-p6"></span>Immediately the king ordered one of his
armed men to cut off Attæus’ feet.  The soldier went, and, seeing the
holy man seated in the chair of the teacher, cut off his legs with his
sword, and immediately the saint gave up the ghost.  We mention this
cursorily, as a fact related by others a long while ago.  There came
then into Armenia the Apostle Bartholomew, who suffered martyrdom among
us in the town of Arepan.  As to Simon, who was sent unto Persia, I
cannot relate with certainty what he did, nor where he suffered
martyrdom.  It is said that one Simon, an apostle, was martyred at
Veriospore.  Is this true, or why did the saint come to this place? I do
not know; I have only mentioned this circumstance that you may know I
spare no pains to tell you all that is necessary.
