id="vi.iv.xiii.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIII.—Condemnation of the
Ignorant.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xiii.xiii-p2"></span>“But if judgment follows upon
disobedience to instruction, much more shall God destroy those who will
not undertake His worship.  For he who will not learn, lest that should
make him subject to judgment, is already judged as knowing, for he knew
what he will not hear; so that imagination avails nothing as an apology
in presence of the heart-knowing God.  Wherefore avoid that cunning
thought suggested by the serpent to your minds.  But if any one end this
life in real ignorance, this charge will lie against him, that, having
lived so long, he did not know who was the bestower of the food supplied
to him:  and as a senseless, and ungrateful, and very unworthy servant,
he is rejected from the kingdom of God.
