id="vii.xii.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 12.</span>

<span id="vii.xii.xiii-p2"></span>And the Jews, hearing that Joseph had
begged the body of Jesus, sought him and the twelve who said that Jesus
was not born of fornication, and Nicodemus, and many others who had
stepped up before Pilate and declared His good works.  And of all these
that were hid, Nicodemus alone was seen by them, because he was a ruler
of the Jews.  And Nicodemus says to them:  How have you come into the
synagogue?  The Jews say to him:  How hast thou come into the synagogue?
for thou art a confederate of his, and his portion is with thee in the
world to come.  Nicodemus says:  Amen, amen.  And likewise Joseph also
stepped out and said to them:  Why are you angry against me because I
begged the body of Jesus?  Behold, I have put him in my new tomb,
wrapping him in clean linen; and I have rolled a stone to the door of
the tomb.  And you have acted not well against the just man, because you
have not repented of crucifying him, but also have pierced him with a
spear.  And the Jews seized Joseph, and ordered him to be secured until
the first day of the week, and said to him:  Know that the time does not
allow us to do anything against thee, because the Sabbath is dawning;
and know that thou shalt not be deemed worthy of burial, but we shall
give thy flesh to the birds of the air.  Joseph says to them:  These are
the words of the arrogant Goliath, who reproached the living God and
holy David. <span id="fr_1838"></span>[1839](#fn_1838.md)   For God has
said by the prophet, Vengeance is mine, and I will repay, saith the
Lord. <span id="fr_1839"></span>[1840](#fn_1839.md)   And now he that is
uncircumcised in flesh, but circumcised in heart, has taken water, and
washed his hands in the face of the sun, saying, I am innocent of the
blood of this just man; see ye to it.  And you answered and said to
Pilate, His blood be upon us, and upon our children.  And now I am
afraid lest the wrath of God come upon you, and upon your children, as
you have said.  And the Jews, hearing these words, were embittered in
their souls, and seized Joseph, and locked him into a room where there
was no window; and guards were stationed at the door, and they sealed
the door where Joseph was locked in.

<span id="vii.xii.xiii-p5"></span>And on the Sabbath, the rulers of the
synagogue, <span id="fr_1840"></span>[1841](#fn_1840.md) and the priests
and the Levites, made a decree that all should be found in the synagogue
on the first day of the week.  And rising up early, all the multitude in
the synagogue consulted by what death they should slay him.  And when
the Sanhedrin was sitting, they ordered him to be brought with much
indignity.  And having opened the door, they found him not.  And all the
people were surprised, and struck with dismay, because they found the
seals unbroken, and because Caiaphas had the key.  And they no longer
dared to lay hands upon those who had spoken before Pilate in Jesus’
behalf.
