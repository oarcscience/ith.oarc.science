id="vi.iii.xii.xlix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLIX.—God’s
Long-Suffering.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.xii.xlix-p2"></span>“But you say, Neither ought God to
do evil.  You say truly; nor does He.  But those who have been created
by Him, while they do not believe that they are to be judged, indulging
their pleasures, have fallen away from piety and righteousness.  But you
will say, If it is right to punish the wicked, they ought to be punished
immediately when they do wickedly.  You indeed do well to make haste;
but He who is eternal, and from whom nothing is secret, inasmuch as He
is without end, in the same proportion is His patience extended, and He
regards not the swiftness of vengeance, but the causes of salvation. 
For He is not so much pleased with the death as with the conversion of a
sinner. <span id="fr_878"></span>[879](#fn_878.md)   Therefore, in short,
He has bestowed upon men holy baptism, to which, if any one makes haste
to come, and for the future remains without stain, all his sins are
thenceforth blotted out, which were committed in the time of his
ignorance.
