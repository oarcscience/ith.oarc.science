id="vi.iii.iii.lii-p1.1"></span>Chapter LII.—The Saints Before Christ’s
Coming.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iii.lii-p2"></span>When he had thus spoken, I
answered:  “If those shall enjoy the kingdom of Christ, whom His coming
shall find righteous, shall then those be wholly deprived of the kingdom
who have died before His coming?”  Then Peter says:  “You compel me, O
Clement, to touch upon things that are unspeakable.  But so far as it is
allowed to declare them, I shall not shrink from doing so.  Know then
that Christ, who was from the beginning, and always, was ever present
with the pious, though secretly, through all their generations: 
especially with those who waited for Him, to whom He frequently
appeared.  But the time was not yet that there should be a resurrection
of the bodies that were dissolved; but this seemed rather to be their
reward from God, that whoever should be found righteous, should remain
longer in the body; or, at least, as is clearly related in the writings
of the law concerning a certain righteous man, that God translated
him. <span id="fr_581"></span>[582](#fn_581.md)   In like manner others
were dealt with, who pleased His will, that, being translated to
Paradise, they should be kept for the kingdom.  But as to those who have
not been able completely to fulfil the rule of righteousness, but have
had some remnants of evil in their flesh, their bodies are indeed
dissolved, but their souls are kept in good and blessed abodes, that at
the resurrection of the dead, when they shall recover their own bodies,
purified even by the dissolution, they may obtain an eternal inheritance
in proportion to their good deeds.  And therefore blessed are all those
who shall attain to the kingdom of Christ; for not only shall they
escape the pains of hell, but shall also remain incorruptible, and shall
be the first to see God the Father, and shall obtain the rank of honour
among the first in the presence of God.”
