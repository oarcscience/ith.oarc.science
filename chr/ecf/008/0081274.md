<span id="vii.xiii.iv-p2"></span>Pilate therefore went outside in rage
and anger, and says to Annas and Caiaphas, and to the crowd who brought
Jesus:  I take the sun to witness that I find no fault in this man.  The
crowd answered:  If he were not a sorcerer, and a magician, and a
blasphemer, we should not have brought him to your highness.  Pilate
said:  Try him yourselves; and since you have a law, do as your law
says.  The Jews said:  Our law permits to put no man to death. <span
id="fr_1877"></span>[1878](#fn_1877)   Pilate says:  If you are
unwilling to put him to death, how much more am I!

<span id="vii.xiii.iv-p4"></span>Then Pilate returned to the palace, and
says to Jesus:  Tell me, art thou the king of the Jews?  Jesus
answered:  Dost thou say this, or have the other Jews said this to thee,
that thou mightst question me?  Pilate said:  Thou dost not think that I
am a Hebrew?  I am not a Hebrew.  Thy people and the chief priests have
delivered thee into my hands; and tell me if thou art king of the Jews? 
Jesus answered:  My kingdom is not of this world; for if my kingdom were
in this world, my soldiers would not be unconcerned at my being seized: 
wherefore my kingdom is not in this world.  Pilate says:  But art thou a
king?  Jesus said:  Thou hast said:  for this was I born, to bear
witness to the truth; and if any one be a man of the truth, he believes
my word, and does it.  Pilate says:  What is the truth? <span
id="fr_1878"></span>[1879](#fn_1878)   Jesus answered:  The truth is
from the heavens.  Pilate says:  On earth, then, is there no truth? 
Christ says:  I am the truth; and how is the truth judged on earth by
those that have earthly power!
