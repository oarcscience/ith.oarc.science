id="vi.iii.vii.xxxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXVI.—Conclusion of
Discourse.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.vii.xxxvi-p2"></span>“And, therefore, although the
serpent lurking within you occupies your senses with a thousand arts of
corruption, and throws in your way a thousand obstacles, by which he may
turn you away from the hearing of saving instruction, all the more ought
you to resist him, and despising his suggestions, to come together the
more frequently to hear the word and receive instruction from us,
because nobody can learn anything who is not taught.” <span

<span id="vi.iii.vii.xxxvi-p4"></span>And when he had done speaking, he
ordered those to be brought to him who were oppressed by sickness or
demons, and laid his hands upon them with prayer; and so he dismissed
the crowds, charging them to resort to the hearing of the word during
the days that he was to remain there.  Therefore, when the crowds had
departed, Peter washed his body in the waters which ran through the
garden, with as many of the others as chose to do so; and then ordered
the couches to be spread on the ground under a very shady tree, and
directed us to recline according to the order established at Cæsarea. 
And thus, having taken food and given thanks to God after the manner of
the Hebrews, as there was yet some portion of the day remaining, he
ordered us to question him on any matters that we pleased.  And although
we were with him twenty in all, he explained to every one whatever he
pleased to ask of him; the particulars of which I set down in books and
sent to you some time ago.  And when evening came we entered with him
into the lodging, and went to sleep, each one in his own place.
