id="vi.iv.xxi.i-p2.1"></span>Chapter I.—Simon Maintains that the Framer
of the World is Not the Highest God.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxi.i-p3"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iv.xxi.i-p3.1"></span>At</span> break of day, when Peter went
forth to discourse, Simon anticipated him, and said:  “When I went away
yesterday, I promised to you to return to-day, and in a discussion show
that he who framed the world is not the highest God, but that the
highest God is another who alone is good, and who has remained unknown
up to this time.  At once, then, state to me whether you maintain that
the framer of the world is the same as the lawgiver or not?  If, then,
he is the lawgiver, he is just; but if he is just, he is not good.  But
if he is not good, then it was another that Jesus proclaimed, when he
said, <span id="fr_1368"></span>[1369](#fn_1368.md) ‘Do not call me good;
for one is good, the Father who is in the heavens.’  Now a lawgiver
cannot be both just and good, for these qualities do not
harmonize.” <span id="fr_1369"></span>[1370](#fn_1369.md)   And Peter
said:  “First tell us what are the actions which in your opinion
constitute a person good, and what are those which constitute him just,
in order that thus we may address our words to the same mark.”  And
Simon said:  “Do you state first what in your opinion is goodness, and
what justice.”
