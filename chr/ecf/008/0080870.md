id="vi.iv.xi.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII.—Metamorphoses of the
Angels.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xi.xii-p2"></span>“For of the spirits who inhabit the
heaven, <span id="fr_1096"></span>[1097](#fn_1096.md) the angels who dwell
in the lowest region, being grieved at the ingratitude of men to God,
asked that they might come into the life of men, that, really becoming
men, by more intercourse they might convict those who had acted
ungratefully towards Him, and might subject every one to adequate
punishment.  When, therefore, their petition was granted, they
metamorphosed themselves into every nature; for, being of a more godlike
substance, they are able easily to assume any form.  So they became
precious stones, and goodly pearl, and the most beauteous purple, and
choice gold, and all matter that is held in most esteem.  And they fell
into the hands of some, and into the bosoms of others, and suffered
themselves to be stolen by them.  They also changed themselves into
beasts and reptiles, and fishes and birds, and into whatsoever they
pleased.  These things also the poets among yourselves, by reason of
fearlessness, sing, as they befell, attributing to one the many and
diverse doings of all.
