id="vi.iii.iv.lxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter LXV.—Fallacy of
Imagination.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iv.lxv-p2"></span>“In short, that you may receive the
faith of the matter; concerning Jerusalem, which I had often seen, I
told my brother what places and what gatherings of people I had seemed
to myself to see.  But also concerning Cæsarea, which I had never seen,
I nevertheless contended that it was such as I had conceived it in my
mind and thought.  But when I came hither, and saw nothing at all like
to those things which I had seen in phantasy, I blamed myself, and
observed distinctly, that I had assigned to it gates, and walls, and
buildings from others which I had seen, taking the likeness in reality
from others.  Nor indeed can any one imagine anything new, and of which
no form has ever existed.  For even if any one should fashion from his
imagination bulls with five heads, he only forms them with five heads
out of those which he has seen with one head.  And you therefore, now,
if truly you seem to yourself to perceive anything with your thought,
and to look above the heavens, there is no doubt but that you imagine
them from those things which you see, placed as you are upon the earth. 
But if you think that there is easy access for your mind above the
heavens, and that you are able to conceive the things that are there,
and to apprehend knowledge of that immense light, I think that for him
who can comprehend these things, it were easier to throw his sense,
which knows how to ascend thither, into the heart and breast of some one
of us who stand by, and to tell what thoughts he is cherishing in his
breast.  If therefore you can declare the thoughts of the heart of any
one of us, who is not pre-engaged in your favour, we shall perhaps be
able to believe you, that you are able to know those things that are
above the heavens, although these are much loftier.”
