<span id="vi.iv.vi.lxxii-p2"></span>And having thus spoken, he placed
his hand upon Zacchæus, saying, “O Thou Ruler and Lord of all, Father
and God, do Thou guard the shepherd with the flock.  Thou art the cause,
Thou the power.  We are that which is helped; Thou the helper, the
physician, the saviour, the wall, the life, the hope, the refuge, the
joy, the expectation, the rest.  In a word, Thou art all things to us. 
In order to the eternal attainment of salvation, do Thou co-operate,
preserve, protect.  Thou canst do all things.  For Thou art the Ruler of
rulers, the Lord of lords, the Governor of kings.  Do Thou give power to
the president to loose what ought to be loosed, to bind what ought to be
bound.  Do Thou make him wise.  Do Thou, as by His name, protect the
Church of Thy Christ as a fair bride.  For Thine is eternal glory. 
Praise to the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost to all ages.  Amen.”
