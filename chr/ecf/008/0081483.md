<span id="ix.xiv.i-p2"></span> ————————————

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p3"></span><span class="c6"><span
id="ix.xiv.i-p3.1"></span>Homily on Habib the Martyr, Composed by Mar
Jacob. <span id="fr_3302"></span>[3303](#fn_3302) </span>

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p6"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="ix.xiv.i-p6.1"></span>Habib</span> the martyr, clad in flame, hath
called to me out of the fire,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p7"></span>That for him likewise I should fashion an
image of beauty among the glorious.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p8"></span>Comrade of conquerors, lo! he beckoneth to
me out of the burning,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p9"></span>That, as for the glory of his Lord, I
should sing concerning him.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p10"></span>In the midst of live coals stands the
*heroic* man, and lo! he calleth to me,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p11"></span>That I should fashion his image:  but the
blazing fire permits me not.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p12"></span>His love is fervid, glowing is his faith;

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p13"></span>His fire also burneth, and who is
adequate to recount his love?

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p14"></span>Nay, by reason of that love which led the
martyr into the fire,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p15"></span>No man is able to recount his beauties
divine.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p16"></span>For who shall dare enter and see in the
blazing fire

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p17"></span>To whom he is like, and after what
pattern he is to be fashioned among the glorious?

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p18"></span>Shall I fashion his image by the side of
the youths, the children of the furnace?

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p19"></span>With Hananiah shall I reckon Habib?  I
know not.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p20"></span>Lo! these were not burned there:  how,
then, is he like?

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p21"></span>He, *I say*, like them, when he was
burned and the youths not?

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p22"></span>Which, I ask, *the more* beautiful—Habib
the martyr, or Azariah?

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p23"></span>Difficult for me is the image:  how I am
to look upon it, I know not.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p24"></span>Lo! Michael was not burned by the flame;

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p25"></span>But Habib was burned:  which, then, *the
more* beautiful to him that looketh upon him?

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p26"></span>Who shall dare say that this is
repulsive, or that;

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p27"></span>Or not so comely this as that, to him
that beholdeth him?

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p28"></span>Three *there are* in the fire, and the
flame cometh not near them;

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p29"></span>But one was burned:  and how shall I
suffice to tell

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p30"></span>That the Fourth *form* is that of Him who
went down into the midst of the furnace,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p31"></span>That He might fashion an image for Habib
there along with *those of* the three?

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p32"></span>He giveth a place in the fire to him who
was burned,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p33"></span>That he may be, instead of Him the
Fourth, by the side of the conquerors.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p34"></span>And, if of the three the beauties be
glorious, though they were not burned,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p35"></span>How shall not this one, who *was* burned,
be mingled with the glorious?

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p36"></span>If a man have the power either to be
burned or not to be burned,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p37"></span>Of this man, who was burned, more exalted
was the beauty than that of the three.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p38"></span>But, inasmuch as the Lord is the control
*of all things*,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p39"></span>*He* is to be praised, *both* where He
rescues and where He delivers up.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p40"></span>Moreover, too, the will of the three who
were not burned,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p41"></span>And of him who was burned, is one and the
same, in this case and in that; <span
id="fr_3303"></span>[3304](#fn_3303)

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p43"></span>And, had its Lord commanded the fire to
burn them,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p44"></span>*Even* those three on their part, burned
they would have been;

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p45"></span><span id="page_709">p. 709</span> <span
id="ix.xiv.i-Page_709"></span>And, if He had signified to it that it
should not burn that one man also,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p46"></span>He would not have been burned; nor had it
been of himself that he was rescued.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p47"></span>To go into the fire was of their own
will, when they went in;

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p48"></span>But that they were not burned—*because*
the Lord of the fire willed and commanded it.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p49"></span>Therefore one equal beauty is that of him
who was burned,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p50"></span>And that of him who was not burned,
because the will also was equal.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p51"></span>Beloved martyr! exalted is thy beauty;
exalted is thy rank:

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p52"></span>Graceful too thy crown, and mingled thy
story with *that of* the glorious.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p53"></span>Choice gold art thou, and the fire hath
tried thee, and resplendent is thy beauty.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p54"></span>And lo! into the King’s crown art thou
wrought, along with the victorious.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p55"></span>Good workman! who, in the doctrine of the
Son of God,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p56"></span>Pursueth his course like a valiant <span
id="fr_3304"></span>[3305](#fn_3304) man, because of the beauty of his
faith.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p58"></span>Habib the martyr was a teacher of that
which is true;

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p59"></span>A preacher also, whose mouth was full of
faith.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p60"></span>Watchful was he, and prompt *for
service;* and he encouraged with his teaching

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p61"></span>The household of the house of God,
through his faith.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p62"></span>Of light was he full, and he wrestled
with the darkness

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p63"></span>Which overspread the country from the
paganism which had darkened it.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p64"></span>With the Gospel of the Son was his mouth
filled in the congregations;

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p65"></span>And as it were a leader of the way did he
become to the villages when he arrived in them.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p66"></span>Zealous he was, because he was concerned
for the doctrine

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p67"></span>Divine, that he might establish the
adherents <span id="fr_3305"></span>[3306](#fn_3305) of the faith.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p69"></span>At the time when the winds of the pagans
blew, a lamp was he,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p70"></span>And flamed forth whilst they blew upon
him, and went not out.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p71"></span>All on fire was he, and filled with the
love of his Lord, and was concerned

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p72"></span>For this—that he might speak of Him
without hindrance. <span id="fr_3306"></span>[3307](#fn_3306)

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p74"></span>The thorns of errour sprang up in the
land from paganism;

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p75"></span>And, as much as in him lay, he rooted
them out by his diligence.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p76"></span>He taught, admonished, and confirmed in
the faith,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p77"></span>The friends of Christ, <span
id="fr_3307"></span>[3308](#fn_3307) who were harassed by persecutors.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p79"></span>Against sword and against fire did he
wrestle,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p80"></span>With love hot as the flame, and was not
afraid.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p81"></span>Like a two-edged brand, <span
id="fr_3308"></span>[3309](#fn_3308) keen was

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p83"></span>His faith, and against error did he
contend.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p84"></span>Leaven did he prove to be in this land
which had become exhausted <span id="fr_3309"></span>[3310](#fn_3309)

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p86"></span>Through fondness for the idols of vanity
which error had brought in.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p87"></span>He was like salt by reason of his savoury
doctrine

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p88"></span>To this region, which had become insipid
through unbelief.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p89"></span>A deacon was he, and filled the place of
a high-priest

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p90"></span>By the preaching and teaching of that
which is true.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p91"></span>He was to the flock a good shepherd
whilst he was *its* overseer;

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p92"></span>And his life laid he down for the flock
while he tended it.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p93"></span>He chased away the wolf, and drove off
from it the beast of prey.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p94"></span>And he repaired the breaches, and
gathered the lambs into their folds.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p95"></span>He went out secretly *and* encouraged the
congregations:

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p96"></span>He strengthened them, and exhorted them,
and held them up.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p97"></span>And he forged armour of faith, and put it
on them,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p98"></span>That they might not be ignominiously
overthrown <span id="fr_3310"></span>[3311](#fn_3310) by the paganism
which abounded.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p100"></span>The flocks of the fold of the Son of God
were being laid waste

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p101"></span>By persecutors:  and he encouraged the
lambs and the ewes.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p102"></span><span id="page_710">p. 710</span> <span
id="ix.xiv.i-Page_710"></span>And he was an advocate to the household of
faith;

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p103"></span>And he taught them not to be daunted by
persecutors.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p104"></span>He taught them to run to meet death,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p105"></span>Without being afraid either of sword or
of fire.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p106"></span>In the teaching of the Son of God he
prospered,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p107"></span>So that his faith pursued its course
without dread.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p108"></span>Then errour grew envious, became
furious, and was maddened, because of him;

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p109"></span>And she pursued after him, that she
might shed upon the earth innocent blood.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p110"></span>The Defamer, who hates the race of men,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p111"></span>Laid snares for him, that he might rid
the place of his presence. <span id="fr_3311"></span>[3312](#fn_3311)

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p113"></span>He who hateth the truth pursued after
him to put him to death,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p114"></span>That he might make his voice to
cease <span id="fr_3312"></span>[3313](#fn_3312) from the teaching of
the house of God.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p116"></span>And errour raised an outcry *demanding*
that Habib should die, because she hated him;

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p117"></span>Vexation goaded her on, and she sought
to take away his life.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p118"></span>His story was talked about <span
id="fr_3313"></span>[3314](#fn_3313) before the pagan judge of the
country,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p120"></span>And the dear fame of him reached the
king:  who in great rage,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p121"></span>And because the diadem was interwoven
with paganism, decreed <span id="fr_3314"></span>[3315](#fn_3314) death

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p123"></span>Against Habib, because he was full of
faith.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p124"></span>And, when the command reached the judge,
he armed himself

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p125"></span>With rage and fury; and, with a mind
thirsting for blood,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p126"></span>And like hunters who lay nets for the
young stag,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p127"></span>After Habib did they go out to catch
*him*.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p128"></span>But this man was a preacher of the
faith,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p129"></span>Who in the highway of the crucifixion
was prospering;

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p130"></span>And, that he might benefit by his
teaching the children of his people,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p131"></span>His work embraced the countries round
about him.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p132"></span>So, when error went out after him, she
found him not:

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p133"></span>Not that he was fled, but that he had
gone out to preach the Gospel.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p134"></span>Then, because of the fury of the pagans,
which was great beyond all that was meet,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p135"></span>His kindred and his mother did they
seize for his sake.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p136"></span>Blessed art thou, O woman! mother since
thou art of the martyr.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p137"></span>For wherefore was it that they seized
thee *and* bound thee, iniquitously?

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p138"></span>What do they require of thee, O thou
full of beauty?  What, *I ask*, have they required of thee?

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p139"></span>Lo! they require of thee that thou bring
the martyr, that he may be a sacrifice.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p140"></span>Bring, oh bring thy sweet fruit to the
place of the oblation—

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p141"></span>*The fruit* whose smell is fragrant,
that it may be incense to the Godhead.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p142"></span>Fair shoot, thy cluster bring from where
it is,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p143"></span>That its wine may be for a libation
whose taste is sweet.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p144"></span>The lamb heard that they were seeking
him, that he might be a sacrifice;

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p145"></span>And he set out and came to the
sacrificers rejoicing.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p146"></span>He heard that others also were being
afflicted for his sake,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p147"></span>And he came that he might bear the
suffering which was his, in the stead of many.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p148"></span>The lot fell on him, to be himself alone
a sacrifice;

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p149"></span>And the fire that was to offer him up
was looking out *for him* until he came.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p150"></span>Of the many who were bound for his sake

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p151"></span>Not one single person was seized to die,
but only he.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p152"></span>He it was that was worthy, and for him
was martyrdom reserved;

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p153"></span>And to snatch the martyr’s place no man
was able.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p154"></span>And therefore of his own will did he
present himself

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p155"></span>To the judge, that he might be seized,
and die for Jesus’ sake.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p156"></span>He heard that they sought him, and he
came that he might be seized, even as they sought him:

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p157"></span>And he went in of himself before the
judge, and dauntless was his look.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p158"></span>He hid not himself, nor did he wish to
flee from the judge:

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p159"></span>For with light was he imbued, and from
the darkness he would not flee.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p160"></span>No robber *was he*, no murderer, no
thief,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p161"></span>No child of night:  but all his course
was run in open day.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p162"></span>Wherefore from his flock should the good
shepherd flee,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p163"></span>And leave his fold to be devoured by
robbers?

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p164"></span>Wherefore should the physician flee, who
goeth forth to heal diseases,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p165"></span>And to cure souls by the blood of the
Son of God?

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p166"></span><span id="page_711">p. 711</span> <span
id="ix.xiv.i-Page_711"></span>A fearless countenance <span
id="fr_3315"></span>[3316](#fn_3315) did the *brave* man carry with him,
and a great heart;

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p168"></span>And to meet death he ran, rejoicing, for
Jesus’ sake.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p169"></span>He went in, he stood before the judge,
saying to him:

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p170"></span>I am Habib, whom ye sought:  lo! *here*
I stand.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p171"></span>And the pagan trembled, and amazement
seized him, and he marvelled at him—

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p172"></span>At the man who was not afraid, either of
sword or of fire.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p173"></span>While he thought that he was fleeing
apace, he entered in and mocked him;

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p174"></span>And the judge shook, for he saw him
courageous in the *very* face of death.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p175"></span>A disciple he of that Son of God who
said:

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p176"></span>“Rise, come, let us go:  for he that
betrayeth me lo! is here.”

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p177"></span>And to the crucifiers, again, He said: 
“Whom seek ye?”

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p178"></span>They say:  “Jesus.”  And He said to
them:  “I am He.”

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p179"></span>The Son of God of His own will came to
the cross;

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p180"></span>And on Him the martyr looked, and
presented himself *uncompelled* before the judge.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p181"></span>And the pagan beheld him, and was
smitten with fear, and was exasperated *against him*.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p182"></span>His rage was excited, and he began in
his fury to put to him questions. <span
id="fr_3316"></span>[3317](#fn_3316)

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p184"></span>And, as if he had been one who had shed
on the ground the blood of the slain,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p185"></span>He proceeded to question the saintly
man, but he was not ashamed:

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p186"></span>Menacing him, and trying to terrify him,
and to frighten him,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p187"></span>And recounting the sufferings which were
being prepared by him on his account.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p188"></span>But Habib, when questioned, was not
afraid,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p189"></span>Was not ashamed, and was not frightened
by the menaces *he heard*.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p190"></span>Lifting up his voice, he confessed
Jesus, the Son of God—

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p191"></span>That he was His servant, and was His
priest, and His minister. <span id="fr_3317"></span>[3318](#fn_3317)

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p193"></span>At the fury of the pagans, roaring at
him like lions,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p194"></span>He trembled not, nor ceased <span
id="fr_3318"></span>[3319](#fn_3318) from the confession of the Son of
God.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p196"></span>He was scourged, and the scourgings were
very dear to him,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p197"></span>Seeing that he bore a little of the
stripes of the Son of God.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p198"></span>He was put into bonds, <span
id="fr_3319"></span>[3320](#fn_3319) and he looked on his Lord, whom
also they had bound;

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p200"></span>And his heart rejoiced that in the path
of His sufferings he had begun to walk.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p201"></span>He ascended the block, <span
id="fr_3320"></span>[3321](#fn_3320) and they tore him with combs, but
his soul was radiant with light,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p203"></span>Because he was *deemed* worthy that on
him should come the agony of the sufferings of crucifixion.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p204"></span>In the pathway of death had he set his
face to walk,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p205"></span>And what could he desire to find in it
but sufferings?

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p206"></span>The fire of sacrifice <span
id="fr_3321"></span>[3322](#fn_3321) was betrothed to him, and for her
did he look;

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p208"></span>And she *on her part* sent him combs,
and stripes, and pains, to taste.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p209"></span>All the while that she was coming, she
sent him sufferings, that by means of them

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p210"></span>He might be prepared, so that when she
met him she might not dismay him.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p211"></span>Sufferings purged him, so that, when the
blazing fire should put him to the proof,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p212"></span>There might not be any dross *found* in
his choice gold.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p213"></span>And he endured the whole of the pains
that came upon him,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p214"></span>That he might have experience *of
suffering*, and in the burning stand like a brave man.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p215"></span>And he accepted rejoicing the sufferings
which he had to bear:

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p216"></span>For he knew that at their termination he
should find death.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p217"></span>And he was not afraid, either of death
or of sufferings:

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p218"></span>For with that wine of the crucifixion
his heart was drunk.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p219"></span>He despised his body, while it was being
dragged along by the persecutors;

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p220"></span>And his limbs, while they were being
torn asunder in bitter agony. <span id="fr_3322"></span>[3323](#fn_3322)

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p222"></span>Scourges on his back, combs on his
sides, stocks on his feet,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p223"></span>And fire in front of him:  still was he
brave and full of faith.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p224"></span>They taunted him:  Lo! thou worshippest
a man;

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p225"></span>But he said:  A man I worship not,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p226"></span>But God, who took a body and became man:

id="ix.xiv.i-Page_712"></span>Him do I worship, because He is God with
Him that begat Him.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p228"></span>The faith of Habib, the martyr, was full
of light

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p229"></span>And by it was enlightened Edessa, the
faithful *city*.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p230"></span>The daughter of Abgar, whom Addæus
betrothed to the crucifixion—

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p231"></span>Through it is her light, through it her
truth and her faith.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p232"></span>Her king is from it, her martyrs from
it, her truth from it;

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p233"></span>The teachers also of *her* faith are
from it.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p234"></span>Abgar believed that Thou art God, the
Son of God;

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p235"></span>And he received a blessing because of
the beauty of his faith.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p236"></span>Sharbil the martyr, son of the
Edessæans, more-ever said:

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p237"></span>My heart is led captive by God, who
became man.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p238"></span>And Habib the martyr, who also was
crowned at Edessa,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p239"></span>Confessed these things:  that He took a
body and became man;

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p240"></span>That He is the Son of God, and also is
God, and became man.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p241"></span>Edessa learned from teachers the things
that are true:

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p242"></span>Her king taught her, her martyrs taught
her, the faith;

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p243"></span>But to others, who were fraudulent
teachers, she would not hearken.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p244"></span>Habib the martyr, in the ear of Edessa,
thus cried aloud

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p245"></span>Out of the midst of the fire:  A man I
worship not,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p246"></span>But God, who took a body and became man

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p247"></span>Him do I worship.  *Thus* confessed the
martyr with uplifted voice.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p248"></span>From confessors torn with combs, burnt,
raised up *on the block*, slain

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p249"></span>And *from* a righteous king, did Edessa
learn the faith,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p250"></span>And she knows our Lord—that He is even
God, the Son of God;

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p251"></span>She also learned and firmly believed
that He took a body and became man.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p252"></span>Not from common scribes did she learn
the faith:

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p253"></span>Her king taught her, her martyrs taught
her; and she firmly believed them:

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p254"></span>And, if she be calumniated as having
ever worshipped a man,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p255"></span>She points to her martyrs, who died for
Him as being God.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p256"></span>A man I worship not, said Habib,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p257"></span>Because it is written:  “Cursed is he
that putteth his trust in a man.” <span
id="fr_3323"></span>[3324](#fn_3323)

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p259"></span>Forasmuch as He is God, I worship Him,
yea submit to be burned

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p260"></span>For His sake, nor will I renounce His
faith.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p261"></span>This truth has Edessa held fast from her
youth,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p262"></span>And in her old age she will not barter
it away as a daughter of the poor.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p263"></span>Her righteous king became to her a
scribe, and from him she learned

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p264"></span>Concerning our Lord—that He is the Son
of God, yea God.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p265"></span>Addæus, who brought the bridegroom’s
ring and put it on her hand,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p266"></span>Betrothed her thus to the Son of God,
who is the Only-*begotten*.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p267"></span>Sharbil the priest, who made trial and
proof of all gods,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p268"></span>Died, even as he said, “for God who
became man.”

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p269"></span>Shamuna and Guria, for the sake of the
Only-*begotten*,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p270"></span>Stretched out their necks *to receive
the stroke*, and for Him died, forasmuch as He is God.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p271"></span>And Habib the martyr, who was teacher of
congregations,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p272"></span>Preached of Him, that He took a body and
became man.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p273"></span>For a man the martyr would not have
*submitted to be* burned in the fire;

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p274"></span>But he was burned “for the sake of God
who became man.”

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p275"></span>And Edessa is witness that thus he
confessed while he was being burned:

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p276"></span>And from the confession of a martyr that
has been burned who is he that can escape?

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p277"></span>All minds does faith reduce to silence
and despise—

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p278"></span>*She* that is full of light and stoopeth
not to shadows.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p279"></span>She despiseth him that maligns the Son
by denying that He is God;

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p280"></span>Him too that saith “He took not a body
and became man.”

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p281"></span>In faith which was full of truth he
stood upon the fire;

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p282"></span>And he became incense, and propitiated
with his fragrance the Son of God.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p283"></span>In all *his* afflictions, and in all
*his* tortures, and in all *his* sufferings,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p284"></span>Thus did he confess, and thus did he
teach the blessed *city*.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p285"></span>And this truth did Edessa hold fast
touching our Lord—

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p286"></span>Even that He is God, and of Mary became
a man.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p287"></span>And the bride hates him that denies His
God-head,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p288"></span>And despises and contemns him that
maligns His corporeal nature.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p289"></span>And she recognises Him *as* One in
Godhead and in manhood—

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p290"></span><span id="page_713">p. 713</span> <span
id="ix.xiv.i-Page_713"></span>The Only-*begotten*, whose body is
inseparable from Him.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p291"></span>And thus did the daughter of the
Parthians learn to believe,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p292"></span>And thus did she firmly hold, and thus
does she teach him that listens to her.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p293"></span>The judge, therefore, full of *zeal for*
paganism, commanded

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p294"></span>That the martyr should be led forth and
burned in the fire which was reserved for him.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p295"></span>And forthwith a strap was thrust into
his mouth, as *though he had been* a murderer,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p296"></span>His confession being kept within his
heart towards God.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p297"></span>And they hurried him away, and he went
out from the judgment-hall, rejoicing

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p298"></span>That the hour was come when the crown
should be given to his faith.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p299"></span>And there went out with him crowds of
people, that they might bear him company,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p300"></span>Looking upon him, not as a dead man
accompanied *to his burial*,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p301"></span>But as a man who was going away that by
means of fire he might become a bridegroom,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p302"></span>And that there might be bestowed the
crown which was by righteousness reserved for him.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p303"></span>They looked upon him as upon a man
entering into battle,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p304"></span>And around him were spears, and lances,
and swords, but he vanquished them.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p305"></span>They beheld him going up like a champion
from the contest,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p306"></span>And in his triumph chaplets were brought
to him by those who beheld.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p307"></span>They looked upon him as he vanquished
principalities and powers,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p308"></span>Which all made war with him, and he put
them to shame.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p309"></span>The whole congregation of the followers
of Christ exulted over him,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p310"></span>Because he raised up the friends <span
id="fr_3324"></span>[3325](#fn_3324) of the faith by the sufferings
which he bore.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p312"></span>There went forth with him the Church, a
bride full of light;

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p313"></span>And her face was beaming on the beloved
martyr who was united to her.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p314"></span>Then did his mother, because it was the
marriage-feast for her son,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p315"></span>Deck herself in garments nobler than her
wont.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p316"></span>Since sordid raiment suited not the
banquet-hall,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p317"></span>In magnificent *attire* all white she
clad herself right tastefully.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p318"></span>Hither to the battle came down love to
fight

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p319"></span>In the mother’s soul—*the love* of
nature, and *the love* of God.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p320"></span>She looked upon her son as he went forth
to be put into the flame;

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p321"></span>And, forasmuch as there was in her the
love of the Lord, she suffered not.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p322"></span>The yearnings of her mother’s womb cried
out on behalf of its fruit;

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p323"></span>But faith silenced them, so that their
tumult ceased.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p324"></span>Nature shrieked over the limb which was
severed from her;

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p325"></span>But the love of the Lord intoxicated the
soul, that she should not perceive it.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p326"></span>Nature loved, but the love of the Lord
did conquer in the strife

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p327"></span>Within the soul of the mother, that she
should not grieve for her beloved.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p328"></span>And instead of suffering, her heart was
filled with all emotions of joy;

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p329"></span>And, instead of mourning, she went forth
in splendid apparel.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p330"></span>And she accompanied him as he went out
to be burned, and was elate,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p331"></span>Because the love of the Lord vanquished
that of nature.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p332"></span>And *clad* in white, as for a
bridegroom, she made a marriage-feast—

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p333"></span>*She* the mother of the martyr, and was
blithe because of him.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p334"></span>“Shamuna the Second” may we call this
blessed *one:*

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p335"></span>Since, had seven been burned instead of
one, she had been well content.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p336"></span>One she had, and she gave him to be food
for the fire;

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p337"></span>And, even as that one, if she had had
seven, she had given *them all*.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p338"></span>He was cast into the fire, and the blaze
kindled around him;

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p339"></span>And his mother looked on, and grieved
not at his burning.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p340"></span>Another eye, which gazeth upon the
things unseen,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p341"></span>Was in her soul, and by reason of this
she exulted when he was being burned.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p342"></span>On the gems of light which are in
martyrs’ crowns she looked,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p343"></span>And on the glory which is laid up for
them after their sufferings;

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p344"></span>And *on* the promised blessings which
they inherit yonder through their afflictions,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p345"></span>And *on* the Son of God who clothes
their limbs with light;

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p346"></span>And *on* the manifold beauties of that
kingdom which shall not be dissolved,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p347"></span>And *on* the ample door which is opened
for them to enter in to God.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p348"></span>On these did the martyr’s mother look
when he was being burned,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p349"></span>And she rejoiced, she exalted, and in
white did she go forth with him.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p350"></span><span id="page_714">p. 714</span> <span
id="ix.xiv.i-Page_714"></span>She looked upon him while the fire
consumed his frame,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p351"></span>And, forasmuch as his crown was very
noble, she grieved not.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p352"></span>The sweet root was thrown into the fire,
upon the coals;

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p353"></span>And it turned to incense, and cleansed
the air from pollution.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p354"></span>With the fumes of sacrifice had the air
been polluted,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p355"></span>And by the burning of this martyr was it
cleansed.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p356"></span>The firmament was fetid with the
exhalations from <span id="fr_3325"></span>[3326](#fn_3325) the altars;

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p358"></span>And there rose up the sweet perfume of
the martyr, and it grew sweet thereby.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p359"></span>And the sacrifices ceased, and there was
peace in the assemblies;

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p360"></span>And the sword was blunted, that it
should no more lay waste the friends of Christ.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p361"></span>With Sharbil it began, with Habib it
ended, in our land;

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p362"></span>And from that time <span
id="fr_3326"></span>[3327](#fn_3326) even until now not one has it
slain, since he was burned.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p364"></span>Constantine, chief of conquerors, took
the empire,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p365"></span>And the cross has trampled on the diadem
of the emperor, and is set upon his head.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p366"></span>Broken is the lofty horn of idolatry,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p367"></span>And from the burning of the martyr even
until now not one has it pierced.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p368"></span>His smoke arose, and it became incense
to the Godhead;

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p369"></span>And by it was the air purged which was
tainted by paganism,

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p370"></span>And by his burning was the whole land
cleansed:

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p371"></span>Blessed be he that gave him a crown, and
glory, and a good name!

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p372"></span>*Here* endeth the Homily on Habib the
martyr, composed by Mar Jacob.

id="ix.xiv.i-p3.2"></span>

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p4"></span> The <span class="c9"><span
id="ix.xiv.i-p4.1"></span>ms.</span> from which this is taken is Cod.
Add. 17,158, fol. 30 vers.  Mar Jacob, bishop of Sarug, or Batnæ, was
one of the most learned and celebrated among all the Syriac writers.  He
was born <span class="c9"><span id="ix.xiv.i-p4.2"></span>a.d.</span>
452, made bishop of Sarug <span class="c9"><span
id="ix.xiv.i-p4.3"></span>a.d.</span> 519, and died <span
class="c9"><span id="ix.xiv.i-p4.4"></span>a.d.</span> 521.  He was the
author of several liturgical works, epistles, and sermons, and, amongst
these, of numerous metrical homilies, of which two are given here. 
Assemani enumerates no less than 231.  Ephraem Syrus also wrote a
similar homily on Habib, Shamuna, and Guria.

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p5"></span>The metre of the original in this and the
following homily consists of twelve syllables, and six dissyllabic feet;
but whether they were read as iambs ortroches, or as both, appears to
depend on the nature of the Syriac accentuation, which is still an
unsettled question.  Hoffmann, in his slight notice of the subject
(*Gram. Syr*., § 13), merely says:  “Scimus, poësin Syriacam non
quantitatis sed *accentus* tantum rationem habere, versusque suos
*syllabarum numero* metiri.  Quâ tamen poëseos Syriacæ conditione
*varietas morarum in pronuntiandis vocalibus observandarum* non
tollitur.”—<span class="c9"><span id="ix.xiv.i-p5.1"></span>Tr.</span>

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p78"></span> The ordinary word for “Christians” in
these documents is the borrowed <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.xiv.i-p78.1"></span>Χριστιανοί</span> :  here a native word is
used, formed from the one which we read as “Messiah.”—<span

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p82"></span> A corruption of the word <span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.xiv.i-p82.1"></span>σαμψηρά</span> is used
here.  It is said by Josephus, *Antiq*., xx. 2, 3, to have been the name
given by the Assyrians to some kind of sword.  Suidas mentions it as a
barbarian word for <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.xiv.i-p82.2"></span>σπάθη</span>, a *broadsword*.  Cureton’s
“scimetar” would be preferable, as being somewhat more distinctive, if
it appeared that a scimetar could have two edges.—<span class="c9"><span

<span id="ix.xiv.i-p85"></span> The temptation was strong to render
\*\*\*, “became unleavened” (or, “tasteless”), a sense apparently
required by the decided figure employed and by the language of the next
couplet, where “insipid ” corresponds to “salt.”  The word \*\*\* (=
<span class="Greek"><span id="ix.xiv.i-p85.1"></span>ἄζυμον</span>),
moreover, if not the Arabic \*\*\* (to which Schaaf, though it does not
appear on what authority, assigns the meaning “*sine fermento massam
subegit*”), seems to point in the same direction.  Dr. Payne Smith,
however, is not aware of any instance of the proposed meaning:  he says,
“My examples make \*\*\* = <span class="Greek"><span
