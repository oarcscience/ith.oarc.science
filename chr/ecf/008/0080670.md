id="vi.iv.v.xxxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXVII.—Spies in the Enemy’s
Camp.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.v.xxxvii-p2"></span>“Some <span
id="fr_944"></span>[945](#fn_944) of our people attend feignedly upon
Simon as companions, as if they were persuaded by his most atheistic
error, in order that they may learn his purpose and disclose it to us,
so that we may be able to encounter this terrible man on favourable
terms.  And now I have learned from them what arguments he is going to
employ in the discussion.  And knowing this, I give thanks to God on the
one hand, and I congratulate you on the other, on the postponement of
the discussion; for you, being instructed by me before the discussion,
of the arguments that are to be used by him for the destruction of the
ignorant, will be able to listen without danger of falling.
