id="vi.iv.vi.xxxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXV.—“These are a Part of His
Ways.”</span>

<span id="vi.iv.vi.xxxv-p2"></span>“And how many things besides are
unknown, having eluded the sagacity of men!  And of those that are
within our comprehension, who of mankind knows the limit?  I mean, how
the heaven rolls, how the stars are borne in their courses, and what
forms they have, and the subsistence of their being, <span
id="fr_976"></span>[977](#fn_976) and what are their ethereal paths. 
And whence the blasts of winds are borne around, and have different
energies; whence the fountains ceaselessly spring, and the rivers, being
ever flowing, run down into the sea, <span id="page_245">p. 245</span>
<span id="vi.iv.vi.xxxv-Page_245"></span>and neither is that *fountain*
emptied whence they come, nor do they fill that *sea* whither they
come!  How far reaches the unfathomable depth of the boundless
Tartarus!  Upon what the heaven is upborne which encircles all!  How the
clouds spring from air, and are absorbed into air!  What is the nature
of thunder and lightning, snow, hail, mist, ice, storms, showers,
hanging clouds!  And how He makes plants and animals!  And these things,
with all accuracy, continually perfected in their countless varieties!
