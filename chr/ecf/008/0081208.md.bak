<span id="vii.v.xxxi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vii.v.xxxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 30.</span>

<span id="vii.v.xxxi-p2"></span>Now a certain Jewish schoolmaster named
Zachyas <span id="fr_1668"></span>[1669](#fn_1668.md) heard Jesus thus
speaking; and seeing that He could not be overcome, from knowing the
power that was in Him, <span id="fr_1669"></span>[1670](#fn_1669.md) he
became angry, and began rudely and foolishly, and without fear, to speak
against Joseph.  And he said:  Dost thou not wish to entrust me with thy
son, that he may be instructed in human learning and in reverence?  But
I see that Mary and thyself have more regard for your son than for what
the elders of the people of Israel say against him.  You should have
given more honour to us, the elders of the whole church of Israel, both
that he might be on terms of mutual affection with the children, and
that among us he might be instructed in Jewish learning.  Joseph, on the
other hand, said to him:  And is there any one who can keep this child,
and teach him?  But if thou canst keep him and teach him, we by no means
hinder him from being taught by thee those things which are learned by
all.  And Jesus, having heard what Zachyas had said, answered and said
unto him:  The precepts of the law which thou hast just spoken of, and
all the things that thou hast named, must be kept by those who are
instructed in human learning; but I am a stranger to your law-courts,
because I have no father after the flesh.  Thou who readest the law, and
art learned in it, abidest in the law; but I was before the law.  But
since thou thinkest that no one is equal to thee in learning, thou shalt
be taught by me, that no other can teach anything but those things which
thou hast named.  But he alone can who is worthy. <span
id="fr_1670"></span>[1671](#fn_1670.md)   For when I shall be exalted on
earth, I will cause to cease all mention of your genealogy.  For thou
knowest not when thou wast born:  I alone know when you were born, and
how long your life on earth will be.  Then all who heard these words
were struck with astonishment, and cried out:  Oh! oh! oh! this
marvellously great and wonderful mystery.  Never have we heard the
like!  Never has it been heard from any one else, nor has it been said
or at any time heard by the prophets, or the Pharisees, or the scribes. 
We know whence he is sprung, and he is scarcely five years old; and
whence does he speak these words?  The Pharisees answered:  We have
never heard such words spoken by any other child so young.  And Jesus
answered and said unto them:  At this do ye wonder, that such things are
said by a child?  Why, then, do ye not believe me in those things which
I have said to you?  And you all wonder because I said to you that I
know when you were born.  I will tell you greater things, that you may
wonder more.  I have seen Abraham, whom you call your father, and have
spoken with him; and he has seen me. <span
id="fr_1671"></span>[1672](#fn_1671.md)   And when they heard this they
held their tongues, nor did any of them dare to speak.  And Jesus said
to them:  I have been among you with children, and you have not known
me; I have spoken to you as to wise men, and you have not understood my
words; because you are younger than I am, <span
id="fr_1672"></span>[1673](#fn_1672.md) and of little faith.

insuperable knowledge of virtue.

<span id="vii.v.xxxi-p5"></span> Tischendorf thinks that the text is
corrupt.  But the meaning seems to be:  You are not a whit better than
your neighbours; for all of you teach what you have named, and you can
teach nothing else.  But he alone (*ipse*, i.e., Christ) can teach more
who is worthy.
