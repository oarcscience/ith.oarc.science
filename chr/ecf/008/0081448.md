id="ix.iii-p7.1"></span>The Story <span
id="fr_2903"></span>[2904](#fn_2903.md) Concerning the King of
Edessa. <span id="fr_2904"></span>[2905](#fn_2904.md) </span>

<span id="ix.iii-p10"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="ix.iii-p10.1"></span>Now</span> the story relating to Thaddæus was
on this wise:—

<span id="ix.iii-p11"></span>While the Godhead of our Saviour and Lord
Jesus Christ was proclaimed among all men by reason of the astonishing
mighty-works which He wrought, and myriads, even from countries remote
from the land of Judæa, who were afflicted with sicknesses and diseases
of every kind, were coming to Him in the hope of being healed, King
Abgar <span id="fr_2905"></span>[2906](#fn_2905.md) also, who was renowned
among the nations on the east of the Euphrates for his valour, had his
body wasting away with a grievous disease, such as there is no cure for
among men.  And when he heard and was informed of the name of Jesus, and
about the mighty works which He did,—for every one alike bore witness
concerning Him,—he sent a letter of request by a man belonging to
him, <span id="fr_2906"></span>[2907](#fn_2906.md) and besought Him to come
and heal him of his disease.

<span id="ix.iii-p15"></span>But our Saviour at the time that he asked
Him did not comply with his request.  Yet He deigned to give him <span
id="fr_2907"></span>[2908](#fn_2907.md) a letter *in reply:*  for He
promised him that He would send one of His disciples, and heal his
sicknesses, and give salvation <span
id="fr_2908"></span>[2909](#fn_2908.md) to him and to all who were
connected with him. <span id="fr_2909"></span>[2910](#fn_2909.md)   Nor did
He delay to fulfil His promise to him:  but after He was risen from the
place of the dead, and was received into heaven, Thomas <span
id="fr_2910"></span>[2911](#fn_2910.md) the apostle, one of the twelve, as
by an impulse from God, sent Thaddæus, <span
id="fr_2911"></span>[2912](#fn_2911.md) who was himself also numbered among
the seventy <span id="fr_2912"></span>[2913](#fn_2912.md) disciples of
Christ, to Edessa, to be a preacher and proclaimer of the teaching of
Christ; and the promise of Christ was through him fulfilled.

<span id="ix.iii-p22"></span>Thou hast in writing the evidence of these
things, which is taken from the Book of Records <span
id="fr_2913"></span>[2914](#fn_2913.md) which was at Edessa:  for at that
time the kingdom was still standing. <span
id="fr_2914"></span>[2915](#fn_2914.md)   In the documents, then, which
were there, in which was contained whatever was done by those of old
down to the time of Abgar, these things also are found preserved down to
the present hour.  There is, however, nothing to prevent our hearing the
very letters themselves, which have been taken by us <span
id="fr_2915"></span>[2916](#fn_2915.md) from <span id="page_652">p.
652</span> <span id="ix.iii-Page_652"></span>the archives, and are in
words to this effect, translated from Aramaic into Greek.

<span id="ix.iii-p26"></span>Copy of the letter which was written by
King <span id="fr_2916"></span>[2917](#fn_2916.md) Abgar to Jesus, and sent
to Him by the hand of Hananias, <span
id="fr_2917"></span>[2918](#fn_2917.md) the Tabularius, <span
id="fr_2918"></span>[2919](#fn_2918.md) to Jerusalem:—

<span id="ix.iii-p31"></span>“Abgar the Black, <span
id="fr_2919"></span>[2920](#fn_2919.md) sovereign <span
id="fr_2920"></span>[2921](#fn_2920.md) of the country, to Jesus, the good
Saviour, who has appeared in the country of Jerusalem:  Peace.  I have
heard about Thee, <span id="fr_2921"></span>[2922](#fn_2921.md) and about
the healing which is wrought by Thy hands without drugs and roots.  For,
as it is reported, Thou makest the blind to see, and the lame to walk;
and Thou cleansest the lepers, and Thou castest out unclean spirits and
demons, and Thou healest those who are tormented with lingering
diseases, and Thou raisest the dead.  And when I heard all these things
about Thee, I settled in my mind one of two things:  either that Thou
art God, who hast come down from heaven, and doest these things or that
Thou art the Son of God, and doest these things.  On this account,
therefore, I have written to beg of Thee that Thou wouldest weary
Thyself to come to me, and heal this disease which I have.  For I have
also heard that the Jews murmur against Thee, and wish to do Thee harm. 
But I have a city, small and beautiful, which is sufficient for two.”

<span id="ix.iii-p36"></span>Copy of those things which were
written <span id="fr_2922"></span>[2923](#fn_2922.md) by Jesus by the hand
of Hananias, the Tabularius, to Abgar, sovereign of the country:—

<span id="ix.iii-p38"></span>“Blessed is he that hath believed in me,
not having seen me.  For it is written <span
id="fr_2923"></span>[2924](#fn_2923.md) concerning me, that those who see
me will not believe in me, and that those will believe who have not seen
me, and will be saved.  But touching that which thou hast written to me,
that I should come to thee—it is meet that I should finish here all that
for the sake of which I have been sent and, after I have finished it,
then I shall be taken up to Him that sent me; and, when I have been
taken up, I will send to thee one of my disciples, that he may heal thy
disease, and give salvation to thee and to those who are with thee.”

<span id="ix.iii-p40"></span>To these letters, moreover, is appended the
following also in the Aramaic tongue:—

<span id="ix.iii-p41"></span>“After Jesus was ascended, Judas Thomas
sent to him Thaddæus the apostle, one of the Seventy.  And, when he was
come, he lodged with Tobias, son of Tobias.  And, when the news about
him was heard, they made it known to Abgar:  “The apostle of Jesus is
come hither, as He sent thee word.”  Thaddæus, moreover, began to heal
every disease and sickness by the power of God, so that all men were
amazed.  And, when Abgar heard the great and marvellous cures which he
wrought, he bethought himself that he was the person about whom Jesus
had sent him word and said to him:  When I have been taken up, I will
send to thee one of my disciples, that he may heal thy disease.  So he
sent and called Tobias, with whom he was lodging, and said to him:  I
have heard that a mighty man has come, and has entered in and taken up
his lodging in thy house:  bring him up, therefore, to me.  And when
Tobias came to Thaddæus he said to him:  Abgar the king has sent and
called me, and commanded me to bring thee up to him, that thou mayest
heal him.  And Thaddæus said:  I will go up, because to him have I been
sent with power.  Tobias therefore rose up early the next day, and took
Thaddæus, and came to Abgar.

<span id="ix.iii-p42"></span>“Now, when they were come up, his princes
happened to be standing <span id="fr_2924"></span>[2925](#fn_2924.md)
there.  And immediately, as he was entering in, a great vision appeared
to Abgar on the countenance of Thaddæus the apostle.  And, when Abgar
saw Thaddæus, he prostrated himself before him. <span
id="fr_2925"></span>[2926](#fn_2925.md)   And astonishment seized upon all
who were standing there:  for they had not themselves seen that vision,
which appeared to Abgar alone.  And he proceeded to ask Thaddæus:  Art
thou in truth the disciple of Jesus the Son of God, who said to me, I
will send to thee one of my disciples, that he may heal thee and give
thee salvation?  And Thaddæus answered and said:  Because thou hast
mightily <span id="fr_2926"></span>[2927](#fn_2926.md) believed on Him that
sent me, therefore have I been sent to thee; and again, if thou shalt
believe on Him, thou shalt have the requests of thy heart.  And Abgar
said to him:  In such wise have I believed on Him, that I have even
desired to take an army and extirpate those Jews who crucified Him; were
it not that I was restrained by reason of the dominion of the
Romans. <span id="fr_2927"></span>[2928](#fn_2927.md)   And Thaddæus said: 
Our Lord has fulfilled the will of His Father; and, having fulfilled it,
has been taken up to His Father.  Abgar said to him:  I too have
believed <span id="page_653">p. 653</span> <span
id="ix.iii-Page_653"></span>in Him and in His Father.  And <span
id="fr_2928"></span>[2929](#fn_2928.md) Thaddæus said:  Therefore do I lay
my hand upon thee in His name.  And when he had done this, immediately
he was healed of his sickness and of the disease which he had.  And
Abgar marvelled, because, like as he had heard concerning Jesus, so he
saw in deeds by the hand of Thaddæus His disciple:  since without drugs
and roots he healed him; and not him only, but also Abdu, <span
id="fr_2929"></span>[2930](#fn_2929.md) son of Abdu, who had the gout:  for
he too went in, and fell at his feet, <span
id="fr_2930"></span>[2931](#fn_2930.md) and when he prayed over him he was
healed.  And many other people of their city did he heal, and he did
great works, and preached the word of God.

<span id="ix.iii-p51"></span>“After these things Abgar said to him: 
Thou, Thaddæus, doest these things by the power of God; we also marvel
at them.  But in addition to all these things I beg of thee to relate to
me the story about the coming of Christ, and in what manner it was; and
about His power, and by what power He wrought those things of which I
have heard.

<span id="ix.iii-p52"></span>“And Thaddæus said:  For the present I will
be silent; <span id="fr_2931"></span>[2932](#fn_2931.md) but, because I
have been sent to preach the word of God, assemble me tomorrow all the
people of thy city, and I will preach before them, and sow amongst them
the word of life; and *will tell them* about the coming of Christ, how
it took place; and about His mission, <span
id="fr_2932"></span>[2933](#fn_2932.md) for what purpose he was sent by His
Father; and about His power and His deeds, and about the mysteries which
He spake in the world, and by what power He wrought these things, and
about His new preaching, <span id="fr_2933"></span>[2934](#fn_2933.md) and
about His abasement and His humiliation, and how He humbled and emptied
and abased Himself, and was crucified, and descended to Hades, <span
id="fr_2934"></span>[2935](#fn_2934.md) and broke through the
enclosure <span id="fr_2935"></span>[2936](#fn_2935.md) which had never
been broken through *before*, and raised up the dead, and descended
alone, and ascended with a great multitude to His Father. <span
id="fr_2936"></span>[2937](#fn_2936.md)

<span id="ix.iii-p61"></span>“Abgar, therefore, commanded that in the
morning all the people of his city should assemble, and hear the
preaching of Thaddæus.  And afterwards he commanded gold and silver to
be given to him; but he received it not, and said:  If we have forsaken
that which was our own, how shall we accept that of others?”

<span id="ix.iii-p62"></span>These things were done in the year
340. <span id="fr_2937"></span>[2938](#fn_2937.md)

<span id="ix.iii-p65"></span>In order, moreover, that these things may
not have been translated to no purpose word for word from the Aramaic
into Greek, they are placed in their order of time here.

<span id="ix.iii-p66"></span>*Here* endeth the first book.

<span id="fn_2902"></span>[651:2903](0081448.htm#fr_2902.md) <span
id="ix.iii-p4.2"></span>

<span id="ix.iii-p5"></span> By Eusebius of Cæsarea.—<span
class="c9"><span id="ix.iii-p5.1"></span>Tr.</span>  The <span
class="c9"><span id="ix.iii-p5.2"></span>ms.</span> from which this
extract from Eusebius is taken is numbered 14,639, fol. 15 b.  It is
described in Cureton’s *Corpus Ignatianum*, p. 350.

<span id="fn_2903"></span>[651:2904](0081448.htm#fr_2903.md) <span
id="ix.iii-p7.2"></span>

<span id="ix.iii-p8"></span> Book I. chapter the thirteenth.—<span

<span id="fn_2904"></span>[651:2905](0081448.htm#fr_2904.md) <span
id="ix.iii-p8.2"></span>

<span id="ix.iii-p9"></span> Properly *Urrhoi*, or *Orrhoi* (\*\*\*). 
It seems probable that the word is connected with *Osrhoene*, the name
of the province in which Edessa held an important place, the correct
form of which is supposed to be Orrhoene.  The name Edessa (\*\*\*)
occurs only once in these Documents, viz., in the “*Acts of Sharbil*,”
*sub init*.—<span class="c9"><span id="ix.iii-p9.1"></span>Tr.</span>

<span id="fn_2905"></span>[651:2906](0081448.htm#fr_2905.md) <span
id="ix.iii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="ix.iii-p12"></span> “By this title all the toparchs of Edessa
were called, just as the Roman emperors were called Cæsars, the kings of
Egypt Pharaohs or Ptolemies, the kings of Syria Antiochi.”  Assem.,
*Bibl. Or*., vol. i. p. 261.  Assemani adds:  “Abgar in Syriac means
*lame*.”  Moses of Chorene, however, with more probability, derives it
from the Armenian *Avag-aïr*, “grand homme, à cause de sa grande
mansuétude et de sa sagesse, et de plus, à cause de sa taille.”  See
below the extract from his *History of Armenia*, book ii. ch. 26.

<span id="fn_2906"></span>[651:2907](0081448.htm#fr_2906.md) <span

meaning “life,” is generally to be translated in this collection.—<span

<span id="fn_2909"></span>[651:2910](0081448.htm#fr_2909.md) <span

<span id="ix.iii-p18"></span> Syr. “near to him;” Gr. <span

<span id="fn_2910"></span>[651:2911](0081448.htm#fr_2910.md) <span
id="ix.iii-p18.2"></span>

<span id="ix.iii-p19"></span> His real name was Judas Thomas:  see p. 8.

<span id="fn_2911"></span>[651:2912](0081448.htm#fr_2911.md) <span
id="ix.iii-p19.1"></span>

<span id="ix.iii-p20"></span> The name is taken from Eusebius, but in
the original Syriac treatises, which follow, he is called Addæus.

<span id="fn_2912"></span>[651:2913](0081448.htm#fr_2912.md) <span
id="ix.iii-p20.1"></span>

<span id="ix.iii-p21"></span> In *The Teaching of the Apostles* he is
said to have been one of the “seventy two apostles.”  His name, like
that of Thomas, seems to have been the very common one, Judas.

<span id="fn_2913"></span>[651:2914](0081448.htm#fr_2913.md) <span
id="ix.iii-p22.1"></span>

<span id="ix.iii-p23"></span> These were kept in the archives of the
kingdom, which were transferred by Abgar from Nisibis to Edessa when he
made it the capital of his dominions.  See Moses Chor. B. ii. ch. 27,
*infra*.  The archives appear to have been still kept at Edessa in <span
class="c9"><span id="ix.iii-p23.1"></span>a.d.</span> 550.  \[Compare
this fact with Tertullian’s statement, vol. iii. p. 164.\]

<span id="fn_2914"></span>[651:2915](0081448.htm#fr_2914.md) <span
id="ix.iii-p23.2"></span>

<span id="ix.iii-p24"></span> The kingdom of Edessa was brought to an
end and entirely subjected to the Romans in <span class="c9"><span
id="ix.iii-p24.1"></span>a.d.</span> 217 or 218.

<span id="fn_2915"></span>[651:2916](0081448.htm#fr_2915.md) <span
id="ix.iii-p24.2"></span>

<span id="ix.iii-p25"></span> The extract from the archives was probably
made by Sextus Julius Africanus, and copied by Eusebius from his
*Chronographia*.

<span id="ix.iii-p28"></span> Called Hanan in the original Syriac
document; and so in Moses Chor.; Eusebius has <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p28.1"></span>᾽Ανανίας</span>, which is copied here.

<span id="fn_2918"></span>[652:2919](0081448.htm#fr_2918.md) <span

<span id="ix.iii-p29"></span> Gr. <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p29.1"></span>ταχυδρόμου</span>.  But the post held by
Hananias must have been one of more dignity than that of a *courier*. 
He was probably a Secretary of State.  In *The Acts of Addæus* (*infra*)
he is called, in connection with the name Tabularius, a *sharir*, or
confidential servant.

<span id="ix.iii-p30"></span>It would seem that Tabularius has been
confounded with Tabellarius, a letter-carrier.—<span class="c9"><span
id="ix.iii-p30.1"></span>Tr.</span>

id="ix.iii-p31.1"></span>

<span id="ix.iii-p32"></span> Or “Abgar Uchomo.”  The epithet was
peculiar to this King Abgar.  He was the fourteenth king:  the eleventh
was called Abgar Sumoco, or “the Red.”

<span id="ix.iii-p33"></span>The occasion of the name “Black” is
doubtful:  it can hardly have arisen from the fact that Abgar was
suffering, as Cedrenus asserts, from the black leprosy.—<span
class="c9"><span id="ix.iii-p33.1"></span>Tr.</span>

But nothing more than *intensity* is necessarily denoted by either
word.  Compare, for the Syriac, [Ps.
19:107](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#107.md),
[167](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#167.md), [Dan.
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#012.md)<span
id="ix.iii-p45.2"></span>.—<span class="c9"><span
id="ix.iii-p45.3"></span>Tr.</span>

<span id="fn_2927"></span>[652:2928](0081448.htm#fr_2927.md) <span
id="ix.iii-p45.4"></span>

<span id="ix.iii-p46"></span> Compare the letters of Abgar and Tiberius,
*infra*.

<span id="fn_2928"></span>[653:2929](0081448.htm#fr_2928.md) <span
id="ix.iii-p46.1"></span>

<span id="ix.iii-p47"></span> In another piece, *The Teaching of
Addæus*, i.e., Thaddæus, we have a portion of the original Syriac from
which Eusebius’ translation was made.  The only portions that correspond
are:  in the present piece, from this place to “—accept that of others,”
near the end; and, in the following one, from the beginning to “—that
which is not ours.”  Some of the variations are worthy of notice.

<span id="fn_2929"></span>[653:2930](0081448.htm#fr_2929.md) <span
id="ix.iii-p47.1"></span>

<span id="ix.iii-p48"></span> See note 9, p. 657, *infra*.

<span id="fn_2930"></span>[653:2931](0081448.htm#fr_2930.md) <span
id="ix.iii-p48.1"></span>

<span id="ix.iii-p49"></span> This answers sufficiently well to the
Greek:  <span class="Greek"><span id="ix.iii-p49.1"></span>ὁς</span>
<span class="Greek"><span id="ix.iii-p49.2"></span>καὶ αὐτὸς προσελθὼν
ὑπὸ τοὺς πόδας αὐτοῦ ἔπεσεν</span>; but, as the original Syriac, p. 12,
reads “he too brought his feet to him, and he laid his hands upon them
and healed him,” the Greek translation must have been at fault.

<span id="ix.iii-p50"></span>For *brought* read *presented*.—<span
class="c9"><span id="ix.iii-p50.1"></span>Tr.</span>

<span id="fn_2931"></span>[653:2932](0081448.htm#fr_2931.md) <span
id="ix.iii-p52.1"></span>

<span id="ix.iii-p53"></span> The original Syriac has “I will not hold
my peace from declaring this.”

<span id="fn_2932"></span>[653:2933](0081448.htm#fr_2932.md) <span
id="ix.iii-p53.1"></span>

<span id="ix.iii-p54"></span> So Euseb.  The orig. Syr. has “His
sender.”

<span id="fn_2933"></span>[653:2934](0081448.htm#fr_2933.md) <span
id="ix.iii-p54.1"></span>

<span id="ix.iii-p55"></span> The orig. Syr. has “the certitude of His
preaching.”  The error seems to have arisen from the Greek translator
confounding \*\*\* with \*\*\*.

<span id="ix.iii-p56"></span>More probably with \*\*\*, “newness (of his
preaching),” which was freely translated by him (<span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.iii-p56.1"></span>περὶ</span>) <span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.iii-p56.2"></span>τῆς καινῆς αὐτοῦ
κηρύξεως</span>; and this, again, was by the Syrian re-translator
rendered literally, as in the text.

<span id="ix.iii-p57"></span>The word *certitude* (above) may be
rendered *unerring truth*. —<span class="c9"><span
id="ix.iii-p57.1"></span>Tr.</span>

<span id="fn_2934"></span>[653:2935](0081448.htm#fr_2934.md) <span
id="ix.iii-p57.2"></span>

<span id="ix.iii-p58"></span> Or “Sheol,” as in Hebrew.  The orig. Syr.
gives “the place of the dead.”

<span id="fn_2935"></span>[653:2936](0081448.htm#fr_2935.md) <span
id="ix.iii-p58.1"></span>

<span id="ix.iii-p59"></span> [Eph. ii.
14](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#014.md)<span id="ix.iii-p59.1"></span>.

<span id="fn_2936"></span>[653:2937](0081448.htm#fr_2936.md) <span

<span id="ix.iii-p60"></span> Comp. [Matt. xxvii.
52](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#052.md)<span id="ix.iii-p60.1"></span>.

<span id="ix.iii-p63"></span> Valesius says that the Edessenes commenced
their era with the 117th Olympiad, the first year of the reign of
Seleucus.  The year 340 corresponds, therefore, with the fifteenth year
of Tiberius.

<span id="ix.iii-p64"></span>It should be the *beginning* of the 117th
Olympiad.—<span class="c9"><span id="ix.iii-p64.1"></span>Tr.</span>
