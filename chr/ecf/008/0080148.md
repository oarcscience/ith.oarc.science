the Sect of Dositheus.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iv.xi-p2"></span>“Meantime, at the outset, as soon as
he was reckoned among the thirty disciples of Dositheus, he began to
depreciate Dositheus himself, saying that he did not teach purely or
perfectly, and that this was the result not of ill intention, but of
ignorance.  But Dositheus, when he perceived that Simon was depreciating
him, fearing lest his reputation among men might be obscured (for he
himself was supposed to be the *Standing One*), moved with rage, when
they met as usual at the school, seized a rod, and began to beat Simon;
but suddenly the rod seemed to pass through his body, as if it had been
smoke.  On which Dositheus, being astonished, says to him, ‘Tell me if
thou art the *Standing One*, that I may adore thee.’  And when Simon
answered that he was, then Dositheus, perceiving that he himself was not
the Standing One, fell down and worshipped him, and gave up his own
place as chief to Simon, ordering all the rank of thirty men to obey
him; himself taking the inferior place which Simon formerly occupied. 
Not long after this he died.”
