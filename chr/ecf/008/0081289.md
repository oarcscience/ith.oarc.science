<span id="vii.xiv.i-p7"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.xiv.i-p7.1"></span>Joseph</span> says:  And why do you wonder
that Jesus has risen?  But it is wonderful that He has not risen alone,
but that He has also raised many others of the dead who have appeared in
Jerusalem to many. <span id="fr_1929"></span>[1930](#fn_1929.md)   And if
you do not know the others, Symeon at least, who received Jesus, and his
two sons whom He has raised up—them at least you know.  For we buried
them not long ago; but now their tombs are seen open *and* empty, and
they are alive, and dwelling in Arimathæa.  They therefore sent men, and
they found their tombs open and empty.  Joseph says:  Let us go to
Arimathæa and find them.

<span id="vii.xiv.i-p9"></span>Then rose up the chief priests Annas and
Caiaphas, and Joseph, and Nicodemus, and Gamaliel, and others with them,
and went away to Arimathæa, and found those whom Joseph spoke of.  They
made prayer, therefore, and saluted each other.  Then they came with
them to Jerusalem, and brought them into the synagogue, and secured the
doors, and placed in the midst the old *covenant* of the Jews; and the
chief priests said to them:  We wish you to swear by the God of Israel
and Adonai, and so that you tell the truth, how you have risen, and who
has raised you from the dead.

<span id="vii.xiv.i-p10"></span>The men who had risen having heard this,
made upon their faces the sign of the cross, and said to the chief
priests:  Give us paper and ink and pen.  These therefore they brought. 
And sitting down, they wrote thus:—
