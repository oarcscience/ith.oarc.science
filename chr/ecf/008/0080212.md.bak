<span id="vi.iii.v.ii-p3"></span>But when the day had dawned, some one
came in and said:  “There is a very great multitude waiting in the
court, and in the midst of them stands Simon, endeavouring to preoccupy
the ears of the people with most wicked persuasions.”  Then Peter,
immediately going out, stood in the place where he had disputed the day
before, and all the people turning to him with joy, gave heed to him. 
But when Simon perceived that the people rejoiced at the sight of Peter,
and were moved to love him, he said in confusion:  “I wonder at the
folly of men, who call me a magician, and love Peter; whereas, having
knowledge of me of old, they ought to love me rather.  And therefore
from this sign those who have sense may understand that Peter may rather
seem to be the magician, since affection is not borne to me, to whom it
is almost due from acquaintance, but is abundantly expended upon him, to
whom it is not due by any familiarity.” <span

<span id="vi.iii.v.ii-p2"></span> Chaps ii.–xii. are wanting in the
<span class="c9"><span id="vi.iii.v.ii-p2.1"></span>mss</span>. of best
authority; and it seems to us indisputable that they form no part of the
original work.  For this reason, and because we have found them utterly
untranslatable, we have omitted them.
