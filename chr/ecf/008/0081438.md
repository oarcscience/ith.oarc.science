<span id="viii.viii.iv-p2"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="viii.viii.iv-p2.1"></span>It</span> should be borne in mind by the
reader that the holy martyr Fabian must not be less esteemed because
this forgery was put upon him long after his decease.  The forger puts
many good things into his work, to make it accord with the character to
which he attributes good and bad together.  So with all the Decretals: 
they are made specious by piety and texts of Scripture.
