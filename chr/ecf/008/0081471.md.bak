<span id="ix.xiii.i-p8"></span>Reign of Abgar; Armenia becomes
completely tributary to the Romans; war with Herod’s troops; his
brother’s son, Joseph, is killed.

<span id="ix.xiii.i-p9"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="ix.xiii.i-p9.1"></span>Abgar</span>, son of Archam, ascends the
throne in the twentieth year of Archavir, king of the Persians.  This
Abgar was called Avak-air (great man), on account of his great
gentleness and wisdom, and also on account of his size.  Not being able
to pronounce well, the Greeks and the Syrians called him Abgar.  In the
second year of his reign, all the districts of Armenia become tributary
to the Romans.  A command is given by the Emperor Augustus, as we are
told in the Gospel of St. Luke, to number all the people in every part. 
Roman commissioners, sent for that purpose into Armenia, carried thither
the statue of the Emperor Augustus, and set it up in all the temples. 
At this very time, our Saviour Jesus Christ, the Son of God, came into
the world.

<span id="ix.xiii.i-p10"></span>At the same period there was trouble
between Abgar and Herod:  for Herod wished that his statue should be
erected near to that of Cæsar in the temples of Armenia.  Abgar
withstood this claim.  Moreover, Herod was but seeking a pretext to
attack Abgar:  he sent an army of Thracians and Germans to make an
incursion into the country of the Persians, with orders to pass through
the territories of Abgar.  But Abgar, far from submitting to this,
resisted, saying that the emperor’s command was to march the troops into
Persia through the desert.  Herod, indignant, and unable to act by
himself, overwhelmed with troubles, as a punishment for his wicked
conduct towards Christ, as Josephus relates, sent his nephew to whom he
had given his daughter, who had been married in the first instance to
Phéror, his brother.  Herod’s lieutenant, at the head of a considerable
army, hastened to reach Mesopotamia, met Abgar at the camp in the
province of Pouknan, fell in the combat, and his troops were put to
flight.  Soon afterwards, Herod died: Archelaus, his son, was appointed
by Augustus ethnarch of Judæa.
