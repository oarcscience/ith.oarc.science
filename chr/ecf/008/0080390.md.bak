<span id="vi.iii.ix.xxiii-p2"></span>But he said:  “Cease:  what mean
you, O Clement, my son?  Do not push away your mother.”  But I, as soon
as I heard these words, immediately bathed in tears, fell upon my
mother, who had fallen down, and began to kiss her.  For as soon as I
heard, by degrees I recalled her countenance to my memory; and the
longer I gazed, the more familiar it grew to me.  Mean time a great
multitude assembled, hearing that the woman who used to sit and beg was
recognised by her son, who was a good man. <span

away from the island, my mother said to me:  “My darling son, it is
right that I should bid farewell to the woman who took me in; for she is
poor, and paralytic, and bedridden.”  When Peter and all who were
present heard this, they admired the goodness and prudence of the woman;
and immediately Peter ordered some to go and to bring the woman in her
bed as she lay.  And when she had been brought, and placed in the midst
of the crowd, Peter said, in the presence of all:  “If I am a preacher
of truth, for confirming the faith of all those who stand by, that they
may know and believe that there is one God, who made heaven and earth,
in the name of Jesus Christ, His Son, let this woman rise.”  And as soon
as he had said this, she arose whole, and fell down at Peter’s feet; and
greeting her friend and acquaintance with kisses asked of her was the
meaning of it all.  But she shortly related to her the whole proceeding
of the *Recognition*, <span id="fr_794"></span>[795](#fn_794.md) so that
the crowds standing around wondered.
