id="vi.iv.v.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.—Mistake About Simon
Magus.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.v.xviii-p2"></span>“Since, then, as I said, some men do
not know the rule of combination, thence they do not know who is my
precursor Simon.  For if he were known, he would not be believed; but
now, not being known, he is improperly believed; and though his deeds
are those of a hater, he is loved; and though an enemy, he is received
as a friend; and though he be death, he is desired as a saviour; and
though fire, he is esteemed as light; and though a deceiver, he is
believed as a speaker of truth.”

<span id="vi.iv.v.xviii-p3"></span>Then I Clement, when I heard this,
said, “Who then, I pray you, is this who is such a deceiver?  I should
like to be informed.”  Then said Peter:  “If you wish to learn, it is in
your power to know it from those from whom I also got accurate
information on all points respecting him.
