<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.iii.xlvii-p2"></A>To this, I replied:&#160; &#8220;I remember, Peter, that you told me of the first man that he was a prophet; but you did not say that he was anointed.&#160; If then there be no prophet without anointing, how could the first man be a prophet, since he was not anointed?&#8221;&#160; Then Peter, smiling, said:&#160; &#8220;If the first man prophesied, it is certain that he was also anointed.&#160; For although he who has recorded the law in his pages is silent as to his anointing, yet he has evidently left us to understand these things.&#160; For as, if he had said that he was anointed, it would not be doubted that he was also a prophet, although it were not written in the law; so, since it is certain that he was a prophet, it is in like manner certain that he was also anointed, because without anointing he could not be a prophet.&#160; But you should rather have said, If the chrism was compounded by Aaron, by the perfumer&#146;s art, how could the first man be anointed before Aaron&#146;s time, the arts of composition not yet having been discovered?&#8221;&#160; Then I answered, &#8220;Do not misunderstand me, Peter; for I do not speak of that compounded ointment and temporal oil, but of that simple and eternal <i>ointment</i>, which you told me was made by God, after whose likeness you say that that other was compounded by men.&#8221;</p>
