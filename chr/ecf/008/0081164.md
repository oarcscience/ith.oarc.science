id="vi.iv.xxiii.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIX.—Peter’s Instructions to
Faustus.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxiii.xix-p2"></span>“When *you are* with these in
Antioch, while you look like Simon, proclaim publicly your *repentance*,
saying, ‘I Simon proclaim this to you:  I confess <span
id="fr_1534"></span>[1535](#fn_1534) that all my statements in regard to
Peter are *utterly false;* <span id="fr_1535"></span>[1536](#fn_1535)
*for he is not* a deceiver, nor a murderer, nor a juggler; nor are any
of the evil things true which I, urged on by wrath, said previously in
regard to him.  I myself therefore beg of you, I who have been the cause
of your hatred to him, cease from hating him; for he is the true apostle
of the true Prophet that was sent by God for the salvation of the
world.  Wherefore also I counsel you to believe what he preaches; <span
id="fr_1536"></span>[1537](#fn_1536) for if you do not, your whole city
will be utterly destroyed.  Now I wish you to know for what reason I
have made this confession to you.  This night angels of God scourged me,
the impious one, terribly, as being an enemy to the herald of the
truth.  I beseech you, therefore, do not listen to me, even if I myself
should come at another time and attempt to say anything against Peter. 
For I confess to you I am a magician, I am a deceiver, I am a juggler. 
Yet perhaps it is possible for me by repentance to wipe out the sins
which were formerly committed by me.’”
