id="vi.iv.xx.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII.—The Fear and Love of
God.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xx.xii-p2"></span>“Thus, then, grateful service to Him
who is truly Lord, renders us free from service to all other
masters. <span id="fr_1344"></span>[1345](#fn_1344)   If, then, it is
possible for any one to be free from sin without fearing God, let him
not fear; for under the influence of love to Him one cannot do what is
displeasing to Him.  For, on the one hand, it is written that we are to
fear Him, and we have been commanded to love Him, in order that each of
us may use that prescription which is suitable to his constitution. 
Fear Him, therefore, because He is just; but whether you fear Him or
love Him, sin not.  And may it be the case that any one who fears Him
shall be able to gain the victory over unlawful desires, shall not lust
after what belongs to others, shall practise kindness, shall be sober,
and act justly!  For I see some who are imperfect in their fear of Him
sinning very much.  Let us therefore fear God, not only because He is
just; for it is through pity for those who have received injustice that
He inflicts punishment on those who have done the injustice.  As water
therefore quenches fire, so does fear extinguish the desire for evil
practices.  He who teaches fearlessness does not himself fear; but he
who does not fear, does not believe that there will be a judgment,
strengthens his lusts, acts as a magician, and accuses others of the
deeds which he himself does.”
