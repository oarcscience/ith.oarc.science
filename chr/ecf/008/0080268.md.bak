id="vi.iii.v.lviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter LXVIII.—Twelve Sent Before
Him.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.v.lviii-p2"></span>And when he had spoken at length on
the subject of baptism, he dismissed the crowd, and betook himself to
his usual place of abode; and there, while the twelve stood around him
(viz. Zacchæus and Sophonias, Joseph and Michæus, Eleazar and Phineas,
Lazarus and Eliseus, I Clement and Nicodemus, Niceta and Aquila), he
addressed us to the following effect:  “Let us, my brethren, consider
what is right; for it is our duty to bring some help to the nations,
which are called to salvation.  You have yourselves heard that Simon has
set out, wishing to anticipate our journey.  Him we should have followed
step by step, that wheresoever he tries to subvert any, we might
immediately confute him.  But since it appears to me to be unjust to
forsake those who have been already converted to God, and to bestow our
care upon those who are still afar off, I think it right that I should
remain three months with those in this city who have been turned to the
faith, and should strengthen them; and yet that we should not neglect
those who are still far off, lest haply, if they be long infected with
the power of pernicious doctrine, it be more difficult to recover them. 
Therefore I wish (only, however, if you also think it right), that for
Zacchæus, whom we have now ordained bishop, Benjamin the son of Saba be
substituted; and for Clement (whom I have resolved to have always by me,
because, coming from the Gentiles, he has a great desire to hear the
word of God) there be substituted Ananias the son of Safra; and for
Niceta and Aquila, who have been but lately converted to the faith of
Christ, Rubelus the brother of Zacchæus, and Zacharias the builder.  I
wish, therefore, to complete the number of twelve by substituting these
four for the other four, that Simon may feel that I in them am always
with him.” <span id="fr_713"></span>[714](#fn_713.md)
