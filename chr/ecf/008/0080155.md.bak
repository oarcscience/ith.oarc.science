id="vi.iii.iv.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.—Responsibility of
Men.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iv.xviii-p2"></span>“To this Aquila answered:  “How,
then, are men in fault, if the wicked one, transforming himself into the
brightness of light, <span id="fr_611"></span>[612](#fn_611.md) promises to
men greater things than the Creator Himself does?”  Then Peter
answered:  “I think,” says he “that nothing is more unjust than this;
and now listen while I tell you how unjust it is.  If your son, whom you
have trained and nourished with all care, and brought to man’s estate,
should be ungrateful to you, and should leave you and go to another,
whom perhaps he may have seen to be richer, and should show to him the
honour which he owed to you, and, through hope of greater profit, should
deny his birth, and refuse you your paternal rights, would this seem to
you right or wicked?”  Then Aquila answered:  “It is manifest to all
that it would be wicked.”  Then Peter said:  “If you say that this would
be wicked among men, how much more so is it in the case of God, who,
above all men, is worthy of honour from men; whose benefits we not only
enjoy, but by whose means and power it is that we began to be when we
were not, and whom, if we please, we shall obtain from Him to be for
ever in blessedness!  In order, therefore, that the unfaithful may be
distinguished from the faithful, and the pious from the impious, it has
been permitted to the wicked one to use those arts by which the
affections of every one towards the true Father may be proved.  But if
there were in truth some strange God, were it right to leave our own
God, who created us, and who is our Father and our Maker, and to pass
over to another?”  “God forbid!” said Aquila.  Then said Peter:  “How,
then, shall we say that the wicked one is the cause of our sin, when
this is done by permission of God, that those may be proved and
condemned in the day of judgment, who, allured by greater promises, have
abandoned their duty towards their true Father and Creator; while those
who have kept the faith and the love of their own Father, even with
poverty, if so it has befallen, and with tribulation, may enjoy heavenly
gifts and immortal dignities in His kingdom.  But we shall expound these
things more carefully at another time.  Meantime I desire to know what
Simon did after this.”
