<span id="viii.iv.i.iii-p2"></span>(Of accusations against doctors.)

<span id="viii.iv.i.iii-p3"></span>Moreover, let no one take up an
accusation against a doctor (*teacher*), because it is not right for
sons to find fault with fathers, nor for slaves to wound their masters. 
Now, all those whom they instruct are sons of doctors; and as sons ought
to love their fathers after the flesh, so ought they to love their
spiritual fathers.  For he does not live rightly who does not believe
rightly, or who reprehends fathers, or calumniates <span
id="page_614">p. 614</span> <span
id="viii.iv.i.iii-Page_614"></span>them.  Doctors therefore, who are
also called fathers, are rather to be borne with than reprehended,
unless they err from the true faith.  Let no one, consequently, accuse a
doctor by writing (*per scripta*); neither let him answer to any
accuser, unless he be one who is trustworthy and recognised by law, and
who leads also a life and conversation free from reproach.  For it is a
thing unworthy that a doctor should reply to a foolish and ignorant
person, and one who leads a reprehensible life, according to the man’s
folly; as Scripture says, Answer not a fool according to his
folly. <span id="fr_2727"></span>[2728](#fn_2727.md)   He does not live
rightly who does not believe rightly.  He means nothing evil who is
faithful.  If anyone is faithful (*a believer*), let him see to it that
he make no false allegations, nor lay a snare for any man.  The faithful
man acts always in faith; and the unfaithful man plots cunningly, and
strives to work the ruin of those who are faithful, and who live in
piety and righteousness, because like seeks like.  The unfaithful man is
one dead in the living body.  And on the other hand, the discourse of
the man of faith guards the life of his hearers.  For as the Catholic
doctor, and especially the priest of the Lord, ought to be involved in
no error, so ought he to be wronged by no machination or passion.  Holy
Scripture indeed says, Go not after thy lusts, but refrain thyself from
thine appetites; <span id="fr_2728"></span>[2729](#fn_2728.md) and we must
resist many allurements of this world, and many vanities, in order that
the integrity of a true continence may be obtained, whereof the first
blemish is pride, the beginning of transgression and the origin of sin;
for the mind with lustful will knows neither to abstain nor to give
itself to piety.  No good man has an enemy except in the wicked, who are
permitted to be such only in order that the good man may be corrected or
exercised through their means.  Whatever, therefore, is faultless is
defended by the Church Catholic.  Neither for prince, nor for any one
who observes piety, is it lawful to venture anything contrary to the
divine injunctions.  Consequently an unjust judgment, or an unjust
decision (*diffinitio*), instituted or enforced by judges under the fear
or by the command of a prince, or any bishop or person of influence,
cannot be valid.  The religious man ought not to hold it enough merely
to refrain from entering into the enmities of others, or increasing them
by evil speech, unless he also make it his study to extinguish them by
good speech. <span id="fr_2729"></span>[2730](#fn_2729.md)   Better is a
humble confession in evil deeds, than a proud boasting in good
deeds. <span id="fr_2730"></span>[2731](#fn_2730.md)   Moreover, all who
live the blessed life, choose rather to run that course in the proper
estate of peace and righteousness, than to involve themselves in the
avenging pains of our sins. <span id="fr_2731"></span>[2732](#fn_2731.md)  
For I am mindful that I preside over the Church under the name of him
whose confession was honoured by our Lord Jesus Christ, and whose faith
ever destroys all errors.  And I understand that I am not at liberty to
act otherwise than to expend all my efforts on that cause in which the
well-being of the universal Church is at stake (*infestatur*).  I hope,
too, that the mercy of God will so favour us, that, with the help of His
clemency, every deadly disease may be removed, God Himself expelling it,
and that whatever may be done wholesomely, under His inspiration and
help, may be accomplished to the praise of thy faith and devotion.  For
all things cannot otherwise be safe, unless, as far as pertains to the
service of the divine office, sacerdotal authority upholds them.  Given
on the 21st day of November in the consulship of the most illustrious
Antoninus and Alexander. <span id="fr_2732"></span>[2733](#fn_2732.md)
