id="x.v.xi-p2.1"></span>From the Book of Extracts. <span
id="fr_3621"></span>[3622](#fn_3621.md) </span>

<span id="x.v.xi-p4"></span>Melito to his brother Onesimus, greeting:—

<span id="x.v.xi-p5"></span>As you have often, prompted by your regard
for the word *of God*, expressed a wish to have some extracts made from
the Law and the Prophets concerning the Saviour, and concerning our
faith in general, and have desired, moreover, to obtain an accurate
account of the Ancient Books, as regards their number and their
arrangement, I have striven to the best of my ability to perform this
task:  well knowing your zeal for the faith, and your eagerness to
become acquainted with the Word, and especially because *I am assured
that*, through your yearning after God, you esteem these things beyond
all things else, engaged as you are in a struggle for eternal salvation.

<span id="x.v.xi-p6"></span>I accordingly proceeded to the East, and
went to the very spot where *the things in question* were preached and
took place; and, having made myself accurately acquainted with the books
of the Old Testament, I have set them down below, and herewith send you
*the list*.  Their names are as follows:—

<span id="x.v.xi-p7"></span>The five *books* of Moses—Genesis, Exodus,
Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy; Joshua, <span
id="fr_3622"></span>[3623](#fn_3622.md) Judges, Ruth, the four *books* of
Kings, the two of Chronicles, the *book of the* Psalms of David, the
Proverbs of Solomon, also called *the Book of* Wisdom, Ecclesiastes, the
Song of Songs, Job, *the books of* the prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, of the
twelve contained in a single book, Daniel, Ezekiel, Esdras.  From these
I have made my extracts, dividing them into six books.
