id="vi.iv.iii.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—“Do Good Unto All?”</span>

<span id="vi.iv.iii.viii-p2"></span>“Wherefore above all things be
careful about chastity; for fornication has been marked out as a bitter
thing in the estimation of God.  But there are many forms of
fornication, as also Clement himself will explain to you.  The first is
adultery, that a man should not enjoy his own wife alone, or a woman not
enjoy her own husband alone.  If any one be chaste, he is able also to
be philanthropic, on account of which he shall obtain eternal mercy. 
For as adultery is a great evil, so philanthropy is the greatest good. 
Wherefore love all your brethren with grave and compassionate eyes,
performing to orphans the part of parents, to widows that of husbands,
affording them sustenance with all kindliness, arranging marriages for
those who are <span id="page_220">p. 220</span> <span

are without a profession, the means of necessary support through
employment; giving work to the artificer, and alms to the incapable.
