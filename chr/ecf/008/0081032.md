<span id="vi.iv.xvii.v-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.xvii.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V.—Practical Refutation of
Genesis.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xvii.v-p2"></span>“While we were thus talking, a great
multitude gathered round us.  And then I looked to the multitude, and
said:  ‘I and my tribe have had handed down to us from our ancestors the
worship of God, and we have a commandment to give no heed to Genesis, I
mean to the science of astrology; <span
id="fr_1199"></span>[1200](#fn_1199) and therefore I gave no attention
to it.  For this reason I have no skill in astrology, but I shall state
that in which I have skill.  Since I am unable to refute Genesis by an
appeal to the science which relates to Genesis, I wish to prove in
another way that the affairs of this world are managed by a providence,
and that each one will receive reward or punishment according to his
actions.  Whether he shall do so now or hereafter, is a matter of no
consequence to me; all I affirm is, that each one without doubt will
reap the fruit of his deeds.  The proof that there is no Genesis is
this.  If any one of you present has been deprived of eyes, or has his
hand maimed, or his foot lame, or some other part of the body wrong, and
if it is utterly incurable, and entirely beyond the range of the medical
profession,—a case, indeed, which not even the astrologers profess to
cure, for no such cure has taken place within the lapse of a vast
period,—yet I praying to God will cure it, <span
id="fr_1200"></span>[1201](#fn_1200) although <span
id="fr_1201"></span>[1202](#fn_1201) it could never have been set right
by Genesis. <span id="fr_1202"></span>[1203](#fn_1202)   Since this is
so, do not they sin who blaspheme the God that fashioned all things?’ 
And the old man answered:  ‘Is it then blasphemy to say that all things
are subject to Genesis?’  And I replied:  ‘Most certainly it is.  For if
all the sins of men, and all their acts of impiety and licentiousness,
owe their origin to the stars, and if the stars have been appointed by
God to do this work, so as to be the efficient causes of all evils, then
the sins of all are traced up to Him who placed Genesis <span
id="fr_1203"></span>[1204](#fn_1203) in the stars.’
