<span id="vi.iv.iii.xx-p2"></span>Whence I, my lord James, having
promised as I was ordered, have not failed to write in books by chapters
the greater part of his discourses in every city, which have been
already written to you, and sent by himself, as for a token; and thus I
despatched them to you, <span id="fr_898"></span>[899](#fn_898.md)
inscribing them “Clement’s Epitome of the Popular Sermons of Peter.” 
However, I shall begin to set them forth, as I was ordered.

<span id="vi.iv.iii.xx-p3"></span> \[Compare with this the remarkable
chapter, *Recognitions*, iii. 75, where a summary is given of previous
writings sent to James.  The design of this letter, evidently known to
Rufinus, was to authenticate the work which follows.  The language of
Rufinus may fairly imply that this letter, known to be of later origin,
was sometimes prefixed to the *Recognitions* also.  This is an evidence
of Jewish-Christian origin.—R.\]
