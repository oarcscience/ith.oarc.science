id="vi.iii.vi.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII.—Translation of Enoch.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.vi.xii-p2"></span>“But <span
id="fr_730"></span>[731](#fn_730.md) that He might show that these things
were done on account of the ungrateful, He translated to immortality a
certain one of the first race of men, because He saw that he was not
unmindful of His grace, and because he hoped to call on the name of
God; <span id="fr_731"></span>[732](#fn_731.md) while the rest, who were so
ungrateful that they could not be amended and corrected even by labours
and tribulations, were condemned to a terrible death.  Yet amongst them
also He found a certain one, who was righteous with his house, <span
id="fr_732"></span>[733](#fn_732.md) whom He preserved, having enjoined him
to build an ark, in which he and those who were commanded to go with him
might escape, when all things should be destroyed by a deluge:  in order
that, the wicked being cut off by the overflow of waters, the world
might receive a purification; and he who had been preserved for the
continuance of the race, being purified by water, might anew repair the
world.

<span id="vi.iii.vi.xii-p4"></span> There seems to be here a mixing up
of the translation of *Enoch* with the statement that in the days of
*Enos* men began to call on the name of the Lord; [Gen. iv.
