id="vi.iii.v.xxxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLII.—“Full of All Subtlety and
All Mischief.”</span>

<span id="vi.iii.v.xxxii-p2"></span>But Peter, when he heard him speak
thus, grinding his teeth, and rubbing his forehead with his hand, and
sighing with profound grief, said: <span
id="fr_695"></span>[696](#fn_695.md)   “Armed with the cunning of the old
serpent, you stand forth to deceive souls; and therefore, as the serpent
is more subtile than any other beast, you profess that you are a teacher
from the beginning.  And again, like the serpent you wished to introduce
many gods; but now, being confuted in that, you assert that there is no
God at all.  For by occasion of I know not what unknown God, you denied
that the Creator of the world is God, but asserted that He is either an
evil being, or that He has many equals, or, as we have said, that He is
not God at all.  And when you had been overcome in this position, you
now assert that the soul is mortal, so that men may not live righteously
and uprightly in hope of things to come.  For if there be no hope for
the future, why should not mercy be given up, and men indulge in luxury
and pleasures, from which it is manifest that all unrighteousness
springs?  And while you introduce so impious a doctrine into the
miserable life of men, you call yourself pious, and me impious, because,
under the hope of future good things, I will not suffer men to take up
arms and fight against one another, plunder and subvert everything, and
attempt whatsoever lust may dictate.  And what will be the condition of
that life which you would introduce, that men will attack and be
attacked, be enraged and disturbed, and live always in fear?  For those
who do evil to others must expect like evil to themselves.  Do you see
that you are a leader of disturbance and not of peace, of iniquity and
not of equity?  But I feigned anger, not because I could not prove that
the soul is immortal, but because I pity the souls which you are
endeavouring to deceive.  I shall speak, therefore, but not as compelled
by you; for I know how I should speak; and you will be the only one who
wants not so much persuasion as admonition on this subject.  But those
who are really ignorant of this, I shall instruct as is suitable.”
