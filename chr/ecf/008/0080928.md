id="vi.iv.xiii.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXI.—Idols Not Animated by the
Divine Spirit.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xiii.xxi-p2"></span>“For many say, We do not worship the
gold or the silver, the wood or the stone, of the objects of our
worship.  For we also know that these are nothing but lifeless matter,
and the art of mortal man.  But the spirit that dwells in them, that we
call God.  Behold the immorality of those who speak thus!  For when that
which appears is easily proved to be nothing, they have recourse to the
invisible, as not being able to be convicted in respect of what is
non-apparent.  However, they agree with us in part, that one half of
their images is not God, but senseless matter.  It remains for them to
show how we are to believe that these images have a divine spirit.  But
they cannot prove to us that it is so, for it is not so; and we do not
believe them *when they say that they* have seen it.  We shall afford
them proofs that they have not a divine spirit, that lovers of truth,
hearing the refutation of the thought that they are animated, may turn
away from the hurtful delusion.
