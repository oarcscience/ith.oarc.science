<span id="vi.iii.x.vii-p2"></span>Then the old man answered:  “Whether
it pleases you, my son, to speak first, or whether you prefer that I
should speak, makes no difference, especially with those who discuss in
a friendly spirit.  However, speak you first, and I will gladly hear;
and I wish you may be able even to follow out those things that are to
be spoken by me, and to put in opposition to them those things that are
contrary to them, and from the comparison of both to show the truth.” 
Niceta answered:  “If you wish it, I can even state your side of the
argument, and then answer it.”  Then the old man:  “Show me first how
you can know what I have not yet spoken, and so I shall believe that you
can follow out my side of the argument.”  Then Niceta:  “Your sect is
manifest, even by the proposition which you have laid down, to those who
are skilled in doctrines of this sort; and its consequence is certain. 
And because I am not ignorant what are the propositions of the
philosophers, I know what follows from those things which you have
propounded; especially because I have frequented the schools of Epicurus
in preference to the other philosophers.  But my brother Aquila has
attended more to the Pyrrhonists, and our other brother to the
Platonists and Aristotelians; therefore you have to do with learned
hearers.” <span id="fr_810"></span>[811](#fn_810)   Then said the old
man:  “You have well and logically informed us how you perceived the
things that follow from the statements which have been enunciated.  But
I professed something more than the tenet of Epicurus; for I introduced
the *genesis*, and asserted that it is the cause of all the doings of
men.”
