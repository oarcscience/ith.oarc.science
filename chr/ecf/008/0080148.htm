<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.iv.xi-p2"></A>&#8220;Meantime, at the outset, as soon as he was reckoned among the thirty disciples of Dositheus, he began to depreciate Dositheus himself, saying that he did not teach purely or perfectly, and that this was the result not of ill intention, but of ignorance.&#160; But Dositheus, when he perceived that Simon was depreciating him, fearing lest his reputation among men might be obscured (for he himself was supposed to be the <i>Standing One</i>), moved with rage, when they met as usual at the school, seized a rod, and began to beat Simon; but suddenly the rod seemed to pass through his body, as if it had been smoke.&#160; On which Dositheus, being astonished, says to him, &#145;Tell me if thou art the <i>Standing One</i>, that I may adore thee.&#146;&#160; And when Simon answered that he was, then Dositheus, perceiving that he himself was not the Standing One, fell down and worshipped him, and gave up his own place as chief to Simon, ordering all the rank of thirty men to obey him; himself taking the inferior place which Simon formerly occupied.&#160; Not long after this he died.&#8221;</p>
