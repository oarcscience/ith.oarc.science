and of those who are born of them; and of accusations which the laws
reject.)

<span id="viii.iv.ii.v-p3"></span>Moreover, marriages among
blood-relations are forbidden, since all laws, both sacred and secular,
forbid such.  Wherefore the divine laws not only expel, but even
anathematize, those who do so, and those who spring from them.  Secular
laws, again, call such persons infamous, and interdict them from
inheriting.  And we too, following our fathers, and keeping close by
their footsteps, brand such with infamy, and hold them to be infamous,
because they are sprinkled with the stains of infamy.  Neither ought we
to admit those men or their accusations, that secular laws reject.  (For
who doubts that human laws, when they are not inconsistent with reason
and honour, are to be embraced, especially when they either further the
public good or defend the authority of the ecclesiastical office, and
uphold it as a help?)  And we call those blood-relations whom divine
laws, and those of the emperors, both Roman and Greek, name
blood-relations, and whom they admit to the right of inheriting, and
cannot exclude from that.  Marriages, then, between such are neither
lawful nor capable of holding good, but are to be rejected.  (And if any
such are attempted in rash daring, they come to be rescinded by
apostolic authority.)
