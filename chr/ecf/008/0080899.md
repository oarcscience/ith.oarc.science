id="vi.iv.xii.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVI.—Powers of the Demons.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xii.xvi-p2"></span>“But that the soul of each man
embodies the forms of demons after his own preconceptions, and that
those who are called gods do not appear, is manifest from the fact that
they do not appear to the Jews.  But some one will say, How then do they
give oracular responses, forecasting future things?  This also is
false.  But suppose it were true, this does not prove them to be gods;
for it does not follow, if anything prophesies, that it is a god.  For
pythons prophesy, yet they are cast out by us as demons, and put to
flight.  But some one will say, They work cures for some persons.  It is
false.  But suppose it were true, this is no proof of Godhead; for
physicians also heal many, yet are not gods.  But, says one, physicians
do not completely heal those of whom they take charge, but these heal
oracularly.  But the demons know the remedies that are suited to each
disease.  Wherefore, being skilful physicians, and able to cure those
diseases which can be cured by men, and also being prophets, and knowing
when each disease is healed of itself, they so arrange their remedies
that they may gain the credit of producing the cure.
