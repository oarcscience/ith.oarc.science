id="vi.iii.iii.lxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter LXIX.—Two Comings of
Christ.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iii.lxix-p2"></span>“To him our James began to show,
that whatsoever things the prophets say they have taken from the law,
and what they have spoken is in accordance with the law.  He also made
some statements respecting the books of the Kings, in what way, and
when, and by whom they were written, and how they ought to be used.  And
when he had discussed most fully concerning the law, and had, by a most
clear exposition, brought into light whatever things are in it
concerning Christ, he showed by most abundant proofs that Jesus is the
Christ, and that in Him are fulfilled all the prophecies which related
to His humble advent.  For he showed that two advents of Him are
foretold:  one in humiliation, which He has accomplished; the other in
glory, which is hoped for to be accomplished, when He shall come to give
the kingdom to those who believe in Him, and who observe all things
which He has commanded.  And when he had plainly taught the people
concerning these things, he added this also:  That unless a man be
baptized in water, in the name of the threefold blessedness, as the true
Prophet taught, he can neither receive remission of sins nor enter into
the kingdom of heaven; and he declared that this is the prescription of
the unbegotten God.  To which he added this also:  ‘Do not think that we
speak of two unbegotten Gods, or that one is divided into two, or that
the same is made male and female.  But we speak of the only-begotten Son
of God, not sprung from another source, but ineffably self-originated;
and in like manner we speak of the Paraclete.’ <span

also concerning baptism, through seven successive days he persuaded all
the people and the high priest that they should hasten straightway to
receive baptism.”
