id="vi.iii.x.xlvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLVII.—Chastisements on the
Righteous and the Wicked.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.x.xlvii-p2"></span>“But perhaps you will say, What of
the fact that, in that common chastisement, like things befall the pious
and the impious?  It is true, and we confess it; but the chastisement
turns to the advantage of the pious, that, being afflicted in the
present life, they may come more purified to the future, in which
perpetual rest is prepared for them, and that at the same time even the
impious may somewhat profit from their chastisement, or else that the
just sentence of the future judgment may be passed upon them; since in
the same chastisements the righteous give thanks to God, while the
unrighteous blaspheme.  Therefore, since the opinion of things is
divided into two parts, that some things are done by order and others
against order, it ought, from those things which are done according to
order, to be believed that there is a providence; but with respect to
those things which are done against order, we should inquire their
causes from those who have learned them by prophetic teaching:  for
those who have become acquainted with prophetic discourse know when, and
for what reason, blight, hail, and pestilence, and such like, have
occurred in every generation, and for what sins these have been sent as
a punishment; whence causes of sadness, lamentations, and griefs have
befallen the human race; whence also trembling sickness has ensued, and
that this has been from the beginning the punishment of parricide. <span
