&#160; &#8220;God having cut off by water all the impious men of old, having found one alone amongst them all that was pious, caused him to be saved in an ark, with his three sons and their wives.&#160; Whence may be perceived that it is His nature not to care for a multitude of wicked, nor to be indifferent to the salvation of one pious.&#160; Therefore the greatest impiety of all is forsaking the sole Lord of all, and worshipping many, who are no gods, as if they were gods.</p>
