<span id="vi.iii.iv.lxiv-p2"></span>“‘Give over,’ says he, ‘O Peter. 
What is it that you are doing?  For those who are beginning to be
possessed with a demon, or to be disturbed in their minds, begin in this
way.  They are first carried away by fancies to some pleasant and
delightful things, then they are poured out in vain and fond motions
towards things which have no existence.  Now this happens from a certain
disease of mind, by reason of which they see not the things which are,
but long to bring to their sight those which are not.  But thus it
happens also to those who are suffering phrenzy, and seem to themselves
to see many images, because their soul, being torn and withdrawn from
its place by excess of cold or of heat, suffers a failure of its natural
service.  But those also who are in distress through thirst, when they
fall asleep, seem to themselves to see rivers and fountains, and to
drink; but this befalls them through being distressed by the dryness of
the unmoistened body.  Wherefore it is certain that this occurs through
some ailment either of the soul or body.’
