<p class="c21"><a name="vii.xvii.xi-p2"></A>And when the paper was finished and read through, all that heard it fell on their faces, weeping bitterly, and cruelly beating their breasts, crying out, and saying through all:&#160; Woe to us!&#160; Why has this happened to us wretched?&#160; Pilate flees; Annas and Caiaphas flee; the priests and Levites flee; moreover also the people of the Jews, weeping and saying, Woe to us wretched! we have shed sacred blood upon the earth.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xvii.xi-p3"></A>For three days, therefore, and three nights, they did not taste bread and water at all; nor did any of them return to the synagogue.&#160; But on the third day again the council was assembled, and the other paper of Leucius was read through; and it was found neither more nor less, to a single letter, than that which the writing of Karinus contained.&#160; Then the synagogue was perplexed; and they all lamented forty days and forty nights, looking for destruction from God, and the vengeance of God.&#160; But He, pitier affectionate and most high, did not immediately destroy them, bountifully giving them a place of repentance.&#160; But they were not found worthy to be turned to the Lord.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xvii.xi-p4"></A>These are the testimonies of Karinus and Leucius, dearest brethren, concerning Christ the Son of God, and His holy deeds in the lower world; to whom let us all give praise and glory through immeasurable age of ages.&#160; Amen.</p>
