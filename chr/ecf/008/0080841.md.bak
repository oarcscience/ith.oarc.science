Honours to a Man.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.ix.xxiii-p2"></span>“Moreover, among the Egyptians even
to the present day, a man is worshipped as a god before his death.  And
this truly is a small impiety, that the Egyptians give divine honours to
a man in his lifetime; but what is of all things most absurd is, that
they worship birds and creeping things, and all kinds of beasts.  For
the mass of men neither think nor do anything with discretion.  But
look, I pray you, at what is most disgraceful of all:  he who is with
them the father of gods and men is said by them to have had intercourse
with Leda; and many of them set up in public a painting of this, writing
above it the name Zeus.  To punish this insult, I could wish that they
would paint their own present king in such base embraces as they have
dared to do with Zeus, and set it up in public, that from the anger of a
temporary monarch, and him a mortal, they might learn to render honour
where it is due.  This I say to you, not as myself already knowing the
true God; but I am happy to say that even if I do not know who is God, I
think I at least know clearly what God is.
