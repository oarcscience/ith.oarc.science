<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.iv.xiii-p2"></A>While I spake these words, and others to the same effect, there arose a great excitement among the crowd; and some as pitying Barnabas, sympathized with me; but others, being senseless, terribly gnashed their teeth against me.&#160; But, as the evening had already come, I took Barnabas by the hand, and by force conducted him, against his will, to my lodging, and constrained him to remain there, lest some one might lay hands on him.&#160; And having spent several days, and instructed me briefly in the true doctrine, as well as he could in a few days, he said that he should hasten into Jud&aelig;a for the observance of the festival, and also because he wished for the future to consort with those of his own nation.</p>
