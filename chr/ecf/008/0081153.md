<span id="vi.iv.xxiii.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.xxiii.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—The Origin of the Good
One Different from that of the Evil One.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxiii.viii-p2"></span>When Peter said this, Micah, <span
id="fr_1508"></span>[1509](#fn_1508) who was himself also one of the
companions that attended on him, said:  “I also should like to learn
from you if the good one has been produced in the same way that the evil
one came into being.  But if they came into being in a similar manner,
then they are brothers in my opinion.”  And Peter said:  “They have not
come into being in a similar way:  for no doubt you remember what I said
in the beginning, that the substance of the body of the wicked one,
being fourfold in origin, was carefully selected and sent forth by God;
<span id="page_342">p. 342</span> <span
id="vi.iv.xxiii.viii-Page_342"></span>but when it was combined
externally, according to the will of Him who sent it forth, there arose,
in consequence of the combination, the disposition which rejoices in
evils: <span id="fr_1509"></span>[1510](#fn_1509)   so that you may see
that the substance, fourfold in origin, which was sent forth by Him, and
which also always exists, is the child of God; but that the accidentally
arising disposition which rejoices in evils has supervened when the
substance <span id="fr_1510"></span>[1511](#fn_1510) was combined
externally by him.  And thus disposition has not been begotten by God,
nor by any one else, nor indeed has it been sent forth by Him, nor has
it come forth spontaneously, <span id="fr_1511"></span>[1512](#fn_1511)
nor did it always exist, like the substance before the combination; but
it has come on as an accident by external combination, according to the
will of God.  And we have often said that it must be so.  But the good
one having been begotten from the most beautiful change of God, and not
having arisen accidentally through an external combination, is really
His Son.  Yet, since these doctrines are unwritten, and are confirmed to
us only by conjecture, let us by no means deem it as absolutely certain
that this is the true state of the case.  For if we act otherwise, our
mind will cease from investigating the truth, in the belief that it has
already fully comprehended it.  Remember these things, therefore; for I
must not state such things to all, but only to those who are found after
trial most trustworthy.  Nor ought we rashly to maintain such assertions
towards each other, nor ought ye to dare to speak as if you were
accurately acquainted with the discovery of secret truths, but you ought
simply to reflect over them in silence; for in stating, perchance, that
a matter is so, <span id="fr_1512"></span>[1513](#fn_1512) he who says
it will err, and he will suffer punishment for having dared to speak
even to himself what has been honoured with silence.”

<span id="vi.iv.xxiii.viii-p3"></span> Dressel remarks that this cannot
be the true reading.  Some other name mentioned in Hom. II. c. 1 must be
substituted here or in c. 4.

<span id="vi.iv.xxiii.viii-p5"></span> We have read <span

Wieseler for <span class="Greek"><span
