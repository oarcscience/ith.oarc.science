<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.iii.lii-p2"></A>When he had thus spoken, I answered:&#160; &#8220;If those shall enjoy the kingdom of Christ, whom His coming shall find righteous, shall then those be wholly deprived of the kingdom who have died before His coming?&#8221;&#160; Then Peter says:&#160; &#8220;You compel me, O Clement, to touch upon things that are unspeakable.&#160; But so far as it is allowed to declare them, I shall not shrink from doing so.&#160; Know then that Christ, who was from the beginning, and always, was ever present with the pious, though secretly, through all their generations:&#160; especially with those who waited for Him, to whom He frequently appeared.&#160; But the time was not yet that there should be a resurrection of the bodies that were dissolved; but this seemed rather to be their reward from God, that whoever should be found righteous, should remain longer in the body; or, at least, as is clearly related in the writings of the law concerning a certain righteous man, that God translated him.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_581"></A><A HREF="#fn_581"><FONT SIZE="1">582</FONT></A>
&#160; In like manner others were dealt with, who pleased His will, that, being translated to Paradise, they should be kept for the kingdom.&#160; But as to those who have not been able completely to fulfil the rule of righteousness, but have had some remnants of evil in their flesh, their bodies are indeed dissolved, but their souls are kept in good and blessed abodes, that at the resurrection of the dead, when they shall recover their own bodies, purified even by the dissolution, they may obtain an eternal inheritance in proportion to their good deeds.&#160; And therefore blessed are all those who shall attain to the kingdom of Christ; for not only shall they escape the pains of hell, but shall also remain incorruptible, and shall be the first to see God the Father, and shall obtain the rank of honour among the first in the presence of God.&#8221;</p>
