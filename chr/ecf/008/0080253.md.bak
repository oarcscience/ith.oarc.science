id="vi.iii.v.xliii-p1.1"></span>Chapter LIII.—Self-Love the Foundation
of Goodness.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.v.xliii-p2"></span>“First of all, then, he is evil, in
the judgment of God, who will not inquire what is advantageous to
himself.  For how can any one love another, if he does not love
himself?  Or to whom will that man not be an enemy, who cannot be a
friend to himself?  In order, therefore, that there might be a
distinction between those who choose good and those who choose evil, God
has concealed that which is profitable to men, i.e., the possession of
the kingdom of heaven, and has laid it up and hidden it as a secret
treasure, so that no one can easily attain it by his own power or
knowledge.  Yet He has brought the report of it, under various names and
opinions, through successive generations, to the hearing of all:  so
that whosoever should be lovers of good, hearing it, might inquire and
discover what is profitable and salutary to them; but that they should
ask it, not from themselves, but from Him who has hidden it, and should
pray that access and the way of knowledge might be given to them:  which
way is opened to those only who love it above all the good things of
this world; and on no other condition can any one even understand it,
however wise he may seem; but that those who neglect to inquire what is
profitable and salutary to themselves, as self-haters and self-enemies,
should be deprived of its good things, as lovers of evil things.
