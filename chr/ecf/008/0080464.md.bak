<span id="vi.iii.x.lviii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iii.x.lviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter LVIII.—Sitting in Judgment Upon
God.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.x.lviii-p2"></span>When Aquila had thus spoken, then I
Clement said:  “To-morrow, my father, you shall speak as you please, and
we will gladly hear you; for I suppose it will also be gratifying to you
that you have to do with those who are not ignorant of the science which
you profess.”  When, therefore, it had been settled between the old man
and me, that on the following day we should hold a discussion on the
subject of <span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iii.x.lviii-p2.1"></span>Genesis</span>—whether all things are
done under its influence, or there be anything in us which is not done
by <span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iii.x.lviii-p2.2"></span>Genesis</span>, but by the judgment of
the mind—Peter rose up, and began to speak to the following
effect: <span id="fr_828"></span>[829](#fn_828.md)   “To me it is
exceedingly wonderful, that things which can easily be found out men
make difficult by recondite thoughts and words; and those especially who
think themselves wise, and who, wishing to comprehend the will of God,
treat God as if He were a man, yea, as if He were something less than a
man:  for no one can know the purpose or mind of a man unless he himself
reveal his thoughts; and neither can any one learn a profession unless
he be for a long time instructed by a master.  How much more must it be,
that no one can know the mind or the work of the invisible and
incomprehensible God, unless He Himself send a prophet to declare His
purpose, and expound the way of His creation, so far as it is lawful for
men to learn it!  Hence I think it ridiculous when men judge of the
power of God in natural ways, and think that this is possible and that
impossible to Him, or this greater and that less, while they are
ignorant of everything; who, being unrighteous men, judge the righteous
God; unskilled, judge the contriver; corrupt, judge the incorruptible;
creatures, judge the Creator.

peculiar to the *Recognitions*; it resembles somewhat the earlier
discourse to Clement in book i.—R.\]
