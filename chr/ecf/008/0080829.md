Before.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.ix.xi-p2"></span>While Appion was allegorizing in this
way, I became plunged in thought, and seemed not to be following what he
was saying.  So he interrupted his discourse, and said to me, “If you do
not follow what I am saying, why should I speak at all?”  And I
answered, “Do not suppose that I do not understand what you say.  I
understand it thoroughly; and that the more that this is not the first
time I have heard it.  And that you may know that I am not ignorant of
these things, I shall epitomize what you have said, and supply in their
order, as I have heard them from others, the allegorical interpretations
of those stories you have omitted.”  And Appion said:  “Do so.”
