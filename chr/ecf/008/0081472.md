<span id="ix.xiii.ii-p3"></span>Founding of the town of Edessa; brief
account of the race of our illuminator.

<span id="ix.xiii.ii-p4"></span>A little while afterwards, Augustus
dies, and Tiberius becomes emperor of the Romans in his stead. 
Germanicus, having become Cæsar, dragging in his train the princes of
the kingdom of Archavir and of Abgar, celebrates a triumph in respect of
the war waged with them, in which these princes had killed Herod’s
nephew.  Abgar, indignant, forms plans of revolt and prepares himself
for combat.  He builds a town on the ground occupied by the Armenian
army of observation, where previously the Euphrates had been defended
against the attempts of Cassius:  this new town is called Edessa.  Abgar
removed to it his court, which was at Medzpine, all his gods, Naboc,
Bel, Patnicagh, and Tarata, the books of the schools attached to the
temples, and even the royal archives.

<span id="ix.xiii.ii-p5"></span>After this, Archavir being dead,
Ardachès, his son, reigns over the Persians.  Though it is not in the
order of the history with respect to time, nor even the order according
to which we have begun these annals, yet, as we are treating of
descendants of the king Archavir, even of the blood of Ardachès his son,
we will, to do honour to these princes, place them, by anticipating the
time, near to Ardachès, in order that the reader may know that they are
of the same race, of the race of the brave Archag; then we will indicate
the time of the arrival of their fathers in Armenia, the Garenians and
the Sourenians, from whom St. Gregory and the Gamsa<span
id="page_703">p. 703</span> <span id="ix.xiii.ii-Page_703"></span>rians
are descended, when, following the order of events, we come to the reign
of the king under whom they appeared.

<span id="ix.xiii.ii-p6"></span>Abgar did not succeed in his plans of
revolt; for, troubles having arisen amongst his relatives in the Persian
kingdom, he set out at the head of an army to allay and bring to an end
the dissension.
