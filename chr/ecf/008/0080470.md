<span id="vi.iii.xi.i-p3"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iii.xi.i-p3.1"></span>On</span> the following day, Peter, along
with us, hastened early to the place in which the discussion had been
held the day before; and when he saw that great crowds had assembled
there to hear, and saw the old man with them, he said to him: <span
id="fr_833"></span>[834](#fn_833.md)   “Old man, it was agreed yesterday
that you should confer to-day with Clement; and that you should either
show that nothing takes place apart from *genesis*, or that Clement
should prove that there is no such thing as *genesis*, but that what we
do is in our own power.”  To this the old man answered:  “I both
remember what was agreed upon, and I keep in memory the words which you
spoke after the agreement was made, in which you taught that it is
impossible for man to know any thing, unless he learn from the true
Prophet.”  Then Peter said:  “You do not know what I meant; but I shall
now explain to you.  I spoke of the will and purpose of God, which He
had before the world was, and by which purpose He made the world,
appointed times, gave the law, promised a world to come to the righteous
for the rewarding of their good deeds, and decreed punishments to the
unjust according to a judicial sentence.  I said that this counsel and
this will of God cannot be found out by men, because no man can gather
the mind of God from conjectures and opinion, unless a prophet sent by
Him declare it.  I did not therefore speak <span id="page_183">p.
183</span> <span id="vi.iii.xi.i-Page_183"></span>of any doctrines or
studies, that they cannot be found out or known without a prophet; for I
know that both arts and sciences can be known and practised by men,
which they have learned, not from the true Prophet, but from human
instructors.
