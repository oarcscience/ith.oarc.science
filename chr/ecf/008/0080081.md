id="vi.iii.iii.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIX.—Peter’s
Satisfaction.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iii.xix-p2"></span>Then Peter, when he heard me speak
thus, said:  “I give thanks to my God, both for your salvation and for
my own peace; for I am greatly delighted to see that you have understood
what is the greatness of the prophetic virtue, and because, as you say,
not even I myself, if I should wish it (which God forbid!), should be
able to turn you away to another faith.  Now henceforth begin to be with
us, and to-morrow be present at our discussions, for I am to have a
contest with Simon the magician.”  When he had thus spoken, he retired
to take food along with his friends; but he ordered me to eat by
myself; <span id="fr_540"></span>[541](#fn_540) and after the meal, when
he had sung praise to God and given thanks, he rendered to me an account
of this proceeding, and added, “May the Lord grant to thee to be made
like to us in all things, that, receiving baptism, thou mayest be able
to meet with us at the same table.”  Having thus spoken, he ordered me
to go to rest, for by this time both fatigue and the time of the day
called to sleep.

expressed, but implied.  The whole passage suggests a separatism quite
contrary to Pauline precept.  Compare the more detailed statement of
separatism in book ii. 70, 72, vii. 29; Homily XIII. 4.—R.\]
