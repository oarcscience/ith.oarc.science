id="vi.iv.xxi.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVI.—These Things Hidden Justly
from the Wise.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxi.xvi-p2"></span>“And do not say He acted impiously
towards the wise in hiding these things from them.  Far be such a
supposition from us.  For He did not act impiously; but since they hid
the knowledge of the kingdom, <span id="fr_1388"></span>[1389](#fn_1388.md)
and neither themselves entered nor allowed those who wished to enter, on
this account, and justly, inasmuch as they hid the ways from those who
wished, were in like manner the secrets hidden from them, in order that
they themselves might experience what they had done to others, and with
what measure they had measured, an equal measure might be meted out to
them. <span id="fr_1389"></span>[1390](#fn_1389.md)   For to him who is
worthy to know, is due that which he does not know; but from him who is
not worthy, even should he seem to have any thing it is taken
away, <span id="fr_1390"></span>[1391](#fn_1390.md) even if he be wise in
other matters; and it is given to the worthy, even should they be babes
as far as the times of their discipleship are concerned.
