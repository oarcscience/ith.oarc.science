Seducers.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.vi.xxvi-p2"></span>“Now therefore, since you do not yet
understand how great darkness of ignorance surrounds you, meantime I
wish to explain to you whence the worship of idols began in this world. 
And by idols, I mean those lifeless images which you worship, whether
made of wood, or earthenware, or stone, or brass, or any other metals: 
of these the beginning was in this wise.  Certain angels, having left
the course of their proper order, began to favour the vices of
men, <span id="fr_738"></span>[739](#fn_738) and in some measure to lend
unworthy aid to their lust, in order that by these means they might
indulge their own pleasures the more; and then, that they might not seem
to be inclined of their own accord to unworthy services, taught men that
demons could, by certain arts—that is, by magical invocations—be made to
obey men; and so, as from a furnace and workshop of wickedness, they
filled the whole world with the smoke of impiety, the light of piety
being withdrawn.
