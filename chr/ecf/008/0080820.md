<span id="vi.iv.ix.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.ix.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II.—The Myths are Not to Be Taken
Literally.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.ix.ii-p2"></span>“The wisest of the ancients, men who
had by hard labour learned all truth, kept the path of knowledge hid
from those who were unworthy and had no taste for lessons in divine
things. <span id="fr_1053"></span>[1054](#fn_1053.md)   For it is not
really true that from Ouranos and his mother Ge were born twelve
children, as the myth counts them:  six sons, Okeanos, Koios, Krios,
Hyperion, Japetos, Kronos; and six daughters, Thea, Themis, Mnemosyne,
Demeter, Tethys, and Rhea. <span id="fr_1054"></span>[1055](#fn_1054.md)  
Nor that Kronos, with the knife of adamant, mutilated his father
Ouranos, as you say, and threw the part into the sea; nor that Aphrodite
sprang from the drops of blood which flowed from it; nor that Kronos
associated with Rhea, and devoured his first-begotten son Pluto, because
a certain saying of Prometheus led him to fear that a child born from
him would wax stronger than himself, and spoil him of his kingdom; nor
that he devoured in the same way Poseidon, his second child; nor that,
when Zeus was born next, his mother Rhea concealed him, and when Kronos
asked for him that he might devour him, gave him a stone instead; nor
that this, when it was devoured, pressed those who had been previously
devoured, and forced them out, so that Pluto, who was devoured first,
came out first, and after him Poseidon, and then Zeus; <span
id="fr_1055"></span>[1056](#fn_1055.md) nor that Zeus, as the story goes,
preserved by the wit of his mother, ascended into heaven, and spoiled
his father of the kingdom; nor that he punished his father’s brothers;
nor that he came down to lust after mortal women; nor that he associated
with his sisters, and daughters, and sisters-in-law, and was guilty of
shameful pæderasty; nor that he devoured his daughter Metis, in order
that from her he might make Athene be born out of his own brain (and
from his thigh might bear Dionysos, who is said to have been rent in
pieces by the Titans) <span id="fr_1056"></span>[1057](#fn_1056.md) ; nor
that he held a feast at the marriage of Peleus and Thetis; <span
id="fr_1057"></span>[1058](#fn_1057) nor that he excluded Eris (discord.md)
from the marriage; nor that Eris on her part, thus dishonoured,
contrived an occasion of quarrelling and discord among the feasters; nor
that she took a golden apple from the gardens of the Hesperides, and
wrote on it ‘For the fair.’  And then they fable how Hera, and Athena,
and Aphrodite, found the apple, and quarrelling about it, came to Zeus;
and he <span id="page_263">p. 263</span> <span
id="vi.iv.ix.ii-Page_263"></span>did not decide it for them, but sent
them by Hermes to the shepherd Paris, to be judged of their beauty.  But
there was no such judging of the goddesses; nor did Paris give the apple
to Aphrodite; nor did Aphrodite, being thus honoured, honour him in
return, by giving him Helen to wife.  For the honour bestowed by the
goddess could never have furnished a pretext for a universal war, and
that to the ruin of him who was honoured, himself nearly related to the
race of Aphrodite.  But, my son, as I said, such stories have a peculiar
and philosophical meaning, which can be allegorically set forth in such
a way that you yourself would listen with wonder.”  And I said, “I
beseech you not to torment me with delay.”  And he said, “Do not be
afraid; for I shall lose no time, but commence at once.

<span id="vi.iv.ix.ii-p6"></span> The common story about Dionysus is,
that he was the unborn son, not of Metis, but of Semele.  Wieseler
supposes that some words have fallen out, or that the latter part of the
sentence is a careless interpolation.
