Burn.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.viii.xxv-p2"></span>“‘Since, therefore, the erotic
desire occurs for the sake of continuation and legitimate increasing, as
I have said, it behoves parents providing for the chastity of their
children to anticipate the desire, by imbuing them with instruction by
means of chaste books, and to accustom them beforehand by excellent
discourses; for custom is a second nature.  And in addition to this,
frequently to remind them of the punishments appointed by the laws,
that, using fear as a bridle, they may not run on in wicked pleasures. 
And it behoves them also, before the springing of the desire, to satisfy
the natural passion of puberty by marriage, first persuading them not to
look upon the beauty of another woman.
