id="vi.iii.iv.xxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVIII.—Consistency of
Christ’s Teaching.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iv.xxviii-p2"></span>To this Peter answered:  “Our
Master, who was the true Prophet, and ever mindful of Himself, neither
contradicted Himself, nor enjoined upon us anything different from what
Himself practised.  For whereas He said, ‘I am not come to send peace on
earth, but a sword; and henceforth you shall see father separated from
son, son from father, husband from wife and wife from husband, mother
from daughter and daughter from mother, brother from brother,
father-in-law from daughter-in-law, friend from friend,’ all these
contain the doctrine of peace; and I will tell you how.  At the
beginning of His preaching, as wishing to invite and lead all to
salvation, and induce them to bear patiently labours and trials, He
blessed the poor, and promised that they should obtain the kingdom of
heaven for their endurance of poverty, in order that under the influence
of such a hope they might bear with equanimity the weight of poverty,
despising covetousness; for covetousness is one, and the greatest, of
most pernicious sins.  But He promised also that the hungry and the
thirsty should be satisfied with the eternal blessings of righteousness,
in order that they might bear poverty patiently, and not be led by it to
undertake any unrighteous work.  In like manner, also, He said that the
pure in heart are blessed, and that thereby they should see God, in
order that every one desiring so great a good might keep himself from
evil and polluted thoughts.”
