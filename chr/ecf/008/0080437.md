<span id="vi.iii.x.xxxi-p2"></span>“What reason also is employed in the
intestines, which are arranged in long circular windings, that they may
gradually carry off the refuse of the food, so as neither to render
places suddenly empty, and so as not to be hindered by the food that is
taken afterwards!  But they are made like a membrane, that the parts
that are outside of them may gradually receive moisture, which if it
were poured out suddenly would empty the internal parts; and not
hindered by a thick skin, which would render the outside dry, and
disturb the whole fabric of man with distressing thirst.
