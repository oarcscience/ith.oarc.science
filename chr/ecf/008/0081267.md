<span id="vii.xii.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vii.xii.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 14.</span>

<span id="vii.xii.xv-p2"></span>And Phinees a priest, and Adas a
teacher, and Haggai a Levite, came down from Galilee to Jerusalem, and
said to the rulers of the synagogue, and the priests and the Levites: 
We saw Jesus and his disciples sitting on the mountain called
Mamilch; <span id="fr_1843"></span>[1844](#fn_1843.md) and he said to his
disciples, Go into all the world, and preach to every creature:  he that
believeth and is baptized shall be saved, and he that believeth not
shall be condemned.  And these signs shall attend those who have
believed:  in my name they shall cast out demons, speak new tongues,
take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall by no
means hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall be
well.  And while Jesus was speaking to his disciples, we saw him taken
up to heaven. <span id="fr_1844"></span>[1845](#fn_1844.md)

<span id="vii.xii.xv-p5"></span>The elders and the priests and Levites
say:  Give glory to the God of Israel, and confess to Him whether you
have heard and seen those things of which you have given us an account. 
And those who had given the account said:  As the Lord liveth, the God
of our fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, we heard these things, and saw
him taken up into heaven.  The elders and the priests and the Levites
say to them:  Have you come to give us this announcement, or to offer
prayer to God?  And they say:  To offer prayer to God.  The elders and
the chief priests and the Levites say to them:  If you have come to
offer prayer to God, why then have you told these idle tales in the
presence of all the people? <span id="fr_1845"></span>[1846](#fn_1845.md)  
Says Phinees the priest, and Adas the teacher, and Haggai the Levite to
the rulers of the synagogues, and the priests and the Levites:  If what
we have said and seen be sinful, behold, we are before you; do to us as
seems good in your eyes.  And they took the law, and made them swear
upon it, not to give any more an account of these matters to any one. 
And they gave them to eat and drink, and sent them out of the city,
having given them also money, and three men with them; and they sent
them away to Galilee.  And these men having gone into Galilee, the chief
priests, and the rulers of the synagogue, and the elders, came together
into the synagogue, and locked the door, and lamented with a great
lamentation, saying:  Is this a miracle that has happened in Israel? 
And Annas and Caiaphas said:  Why are you so much moved?  Why do you
weep?  Do you not know that his disciples have given a sum of gold to
the guards of the tomb, and have instructed them to say that an angel
came down and rolled away the stone from the door of the tomb?  And the
priests and the elders said:  Be it that his disciples have stolen his
body; how is it that the life has come into his body, and that he is
going about in Galilee?  And they being unable to give an answer to
these things, said, after great hesitation:  It is not lawful for us to
believe the uncircumcised.
