id="vii.xiv.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 7 (23).</span>

<span id="vii.xiv.vii-p2"></span>And Hades receiving Satan, said to
him:  Beelzebul, heir of fire and punishment, enemy of the saints,
through what necessity didst thou bring about that the King of glory
should be crucified, so that he should come here and deprive us *of our
power?*  Turn and see that not one of the dead has been left in me, but
all that thou hast gained through the tree of knowledge, all hast thou
lost through the tree of the cross:  and all thy joy has been turned
into grief; and wishing to put to death the King of glory, thou hast put
thyself to death.  For, since I have received thee to keep thee safe, by
experience shalt thou learn how many evils I shall do unto thee.  O
arch-devil, the beginning of death, root of sin, end of all evil, what
evil didst thou find in Jesus, that thou shouldst compass his
destruction? how hast thou dared to do such evil? how hast thou busied
thyself to bring down such a man into this darkness, through whom thou
hast been deprived of all who have died from eternity?
