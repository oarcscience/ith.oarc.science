id="vi.iii.iv.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXI.—Righteousness the Way to the
Kingdom.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iv.xxi-p2"></span>“For if we occupy the short time of
this life with vain and useless questions, we shall without doubt go
into the presence of God empty and void of good works, when, as I have
said, our works shall be brought into judgment.  For everything has its
own time and place.  This is the place, this the time of works; the
world to come, that of recompenses.  That we may not therefore be
entangled, by changing the order of places and times, let us inquire, in
the first place, what is the righteousness of God; so that, like persons
going to set out on a journey, we may be filled with good works as with
abundant provision, so that we may be able to come to the kingdom of
God, as to a very great city.  For to those who think aright, God is
manifest even by the operations of the world which He hath made, using
the evidence of His creation; <span id="fr_615"></span>[616](#fn_615.md)
and therefore, since there ought to be no doubt about God, we have now
to inquire only about His righteousness and His kingdom.  But if our
mind suggest to us to make any inquiry concerning secret and hidden
things before we inquire into the works of righteousness, we ought to
render to ourselves a reason, because if acting well we shall merit to
obtain salvation:   then, going to God chaste and clean, we shall be
filled with the Holy Spirit, and shall know all things that are secret
and hidden, without any cavilling of questions; whereas now, even if any
one should spend the whole of his life in inquiring into these things,
he not only shall not be able to find them, but shall involve himself in
greater errors, because he did not first enter through the way of
righteousness, and strive to reach the haven of life.”
