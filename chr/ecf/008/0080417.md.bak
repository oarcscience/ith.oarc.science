<span id="vi.iii.x.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iii.x.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI.—General or Special
Providence.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.x.xi-p2"></span>“Now, if it be taught that there is a
providence, and that the world was made by it, other questions meet us
which must be discussed.  For it will be asked, In what way providence
acts, whether generally towards the whole, or specially towards the
parts, or generally also towards the parts, or both generally towards
the whole, and specially towards the parts?  But by general providence
we mean this:  as if God, at first making the world, has given an order
and appointed a course to things, and has ceased to take any further
care of what is done.  But special providence towards the parts is of
this sort, that He exercises providence over some men or places, but not
over others.  But general over all, and at the same time special over
the parts, is in this wise:  if God made all things at first, and
exercises providence over each individual even to the end, and renders
to every one according to his deeds.
