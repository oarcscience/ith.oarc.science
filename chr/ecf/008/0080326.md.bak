id="vi.iii.vii.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII.—Call of the
Gentiles.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.vii.xii-p2"></span>“But this happened by the providence
of God, that the knowledge of this good One should be handed over to the
Gentiles, and those who had never heard of Him, nor had learned from the
prophets, should acknowledge Him, while those who had acknowledged Him
in their daily meditations should not know Him.  For, behold, by you who
are now present, and desire to hear the doctrine of His faith, and to
know what, and how, and of what sort is His coming, the prophetic truth
is fulfilled.  For this is what the prophets foretold, that He is to be
sought for by you, who never heard of Him. <span
id="fr_756"></span>[757](#fn_756.md)   And, therefore, seeing that the
prophetic sayings are fulfilled even in yourselves, you rightly believe
in Him alone, you rightly wait for Him, you rightly inquire concerning
Him, that you not only may wait for Him, but also believing, you may
obtain the inheritance of His kingdom; <span id="page_146">p. 146</span>
<span id="vi.iii.vii.xii-Page_146"></span>according to what Himself
said, that every one is made the servant of him to whom he yields
subjection. <span id="fr_757"></span>[758](#fn_757.md)
