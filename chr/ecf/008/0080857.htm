<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.x.xii-p2"></A>As he said these things, all fell on their knees before his feet.&#160; And he, lifting up his hands to heaven, prayed to God, and healed them all by his simple prayer alone.&#160; And he remained not many days in Beyrout; but after he had accustomed many to the service of the one God, and had baptized them, and had set over them a bishop from the elders who were with him, he went to Byblus.&#160; And when he came there, and learned that Simon had not waited for them for a day, but had gone straightway to Tripolis, he remained there only a few days; and after that he had healed not a few, and exercised them in the Scriptures, he followed in Simon&#146;s track to Tripolis, preferring to pursue him rather than flee from him.</p>
