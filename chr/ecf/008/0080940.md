id="vi.iv.xiv.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI.—Why God Suffers Objects of
Idolatry to Subsist.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xiv.vi-p2"></span>“But some say, Unless He wished these
things to be, they should not be, but He would take them away.  But I
say this shall assuredly be the case, when all shall show their
preference for Him, and thus there shall be a change of the present
world.  However, if you wished Him to act thus, so that none of the
things that are worshipped should subsist, tell me what of existing
things you have not worshipped.  Do not some of you worship the sun, and
some the moon, and some water, and some the earth, and some the
mountains, and some plants, and some seeds, and some also man, as in
Egypt?  Therefore God must have suffered nothing, not even you, so that
there should have been neither worshipped nor worshipper.  Truly this is
what the terrible serpent which lurks in you would have, and spares you
not.  But so it shall not be.  For it is not the thing that is
worshipped that sins; for it suffers violence at the hands of him who
will worship it.  For though unjust judgment is passed by all men, yet
not by God.  For it is not just that the sufferer and the disposer
receive the same punishment, unless he willingly receive the honour
which belongs only to the Most Honourable.
