<span id="vii.xvi.v-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vii.xvi.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter 5 (21).</span>

<span id="vii.xvi.v-p2"></span>And as Prince Satan and Hades were thus
speaking to each other in turn, suddenly there was a voice as of
thunders, and a shouting of spirits:  Lift up your gates, ye princes;
and be ye lifted up, ye everlasting gates; and the King of glory shall
come in. <span id="fr_1977"></span>[1978](#fn_1977.md)   Hades hearing
this, said to Prince Satan:  Retire from me, and go outside of my
realms:  if thou art a powerful warrior, fight against the King of
glory.  But what hast thou to do with Him?  And Hades thrust Satan
outside of his realms.  And Hades said to his impious officers:  Shut
the cruel gates of brass, and put up the bars of iron, and resist
bravely, that we, holding captivity, may not take *Him* captive. <span
id="fr_1978"></span>[1979](#fn_1978.md)

<span id="vii.xvi.v-p5"></span>And all the multitude of the saints,
hearing this, said to Hades, with the voice of reproach:  Open thy
gates, that the King of glory may come in.  And David cried out,
saying:  Did I not, when I was alive upon earth, prophesy to you:  Let
them confess to the Lord His tender mercies and His wonderful works to
the children of men:  for He has shattered the brazen gates, and burst
the iron bars; He has taken them up out of the way of their
iniquity? <span id="fr_1979"></span>[1980](#fn_1979.md)   And after this,
in like manner, Esaias said:  Did not I, when I was alive upon earth,
prophesy to you:  The dead shall rise up, and those who are in their
tombs shall rise again, and those who are upon earth shall exult;
because the dew, which is from the Lord, is their health? <span
id="fr_1980"></span>[1981](#fn_1980.md)   And again I said, Where, O Death,
is thy sting? where, O Hades, is thy victory? <span
id="fr_1981"></span>[1982](#fn_1981.md)

<span id="vii.xvi.v-p9"></span>And when all the saints heard this from
Esaias, they said to Hades:  Open thy gates.  Since thou art now
conquered, thou wilt be weak and powerless.  And there was a great
voice, as of thunders, saying:  Lift up your gates, ye princes; and be
ye lifted up, ye infernal gates; and the King of glory shall come in. 
Hades, seeing that they had twice shouted out this, says, as if not
knowing:  Who is the king of glory?  David says, in answer to Hades:  I
recognise those words of the shout, since I prophesied the same by His
Spirit.  And now, what I have said above I say to thee, The Lord strong
and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle; He is the King of glory. <span
id="fr_1982"></span>[1983](#fn_1982.md)   And the Lord Himself hath looked
down from heaven upon earth, to hear the groans of the prisoners, and to
release the sons of the slain. <span
id="fr_1983"></span>[1984](#fn_1983.md)   And now, most filthy and most
foul Hades, open thy gates, that the King of glory may come in.  While
David was thus speaking, there came to Hades, in the form of a man, the
Lord of majesty, and lighted up the eternal darkness, and burst asunder
the indissoluble chains; and the aid of unconquered power visited us,
sitting in the profound darkness of transgressions, and in the shadow of
death of sins. <span id="fr_1984"></span>[1985](#fn_1984.md)
