<p class="c21"><a name="vii.xii.ii-p2"></A>Having called a council, the high priests and scribes Annas and Caiaphas and Semes and Dathaes, and Gamaliel, Judas, Levi and Nephthalim, Alexander and Ja&iuml;rus,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1803"></A><A HREF="#fn_1803"><FONT SIZE="1">1804</FONT></A>
 and the rest of the Jews, came to Pilate accusing Jesus about many things, saying:&#160; We know this man to be the son of Joseph the carpenter, born of Mary; and he says that he is the Son of God, and a king; moreover, he profanes the Sabbath, and wishes to do away with the law of our fathers.&#160; Pilate says:&#160; And what are the things which he does, to show that he wishes to do away with it?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1804"></A><A HREF="#fn_1804"><FONT SIZE="1">1805</FONT></A>
&#160; The Jews say:&#160; We have a law not to cure any one on the Sabbath; but this man&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1805"></A><A HREF="#fn_1805"><FONT SIZE="1">1806</FONT></A>
 has on the Sabbath cured the lame and the crooked, the withered and the blind and the paralytic, the dumb and the demoniac, by evil practices.&#160; Pilate says to them:&#160; What evil practices?&#160; They say to him:&#160; He is a magician, and by Beelzebul prince of the demons he casts out the demons, and all are subject to him.&#160; Pilate says to them:&#160; This is not casting out the demons by an unclean spirit, but by the god &AElig;sculapius.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xii.ii-p6"></A><A NAME="page_417"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 417</FONT></A> <a name="vii.xii.ii-Page_417"></A>The Jews say to Pilate:&#160; we entreat your highness that he stand at thy tribunal, and be heard.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1806"></A><A HREF="#fn_1806"><FONT SIZE="1">1807</FONT></A>
&#160; And Pilate having called them, says:&#160; Tell me how I, being a procurator, can try a king?&#160; They say to him:&#160; We do not say that he is a king, but he himself says that he is.&#160; And Pilate having called the runner, says to him:&#160; Let Jesus be brought in with respect.&#160; And the runner going out, and recognising Him, adored Him, and took his cloak into his hand, and spread it on the ground, and says to him:&#160; My lord, walk on this, and come in, for the procurator calls thee.&#160; And the Jews seeing what the runner had done, cried out against Pilate, saying:&#160; Why hast thou ordered him to come in by a runner, and not by a crier? for assuredly the runner, when he saw him, adored him, and spread his doublet on the ground, and made him walk like a king.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xii.ii-p8"></A>And Pilate having called the runner, says to him:&#160; Why hast thou done this, and spread out thy cloak upon the earth, and made Jesus walk upon it?&#160; The runner says to him:&#160; My lord procurator, when thou didst send me to Jerusalem to Alexander,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1807"></A><A HREF="#fn_1807"><FONT SIZE="1">1808</FONT></A>
 I saw him sitting upon an ass, and the sons of the Hebrews held branches in their hands, and shouted; and other spread their clothes under him saying, Save now, thou who art in the highest:&#160; blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1808"></A><A HREF="#fn_1808"><FONT SIZE="1">1809</FONT></A>
</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xii.ii-p11"></A>The Jews cry out, and say to the runner:&#160; The sons of the Hebrews shouted in Hebrew; whence then hast thou the Greek?&#160; The runner says to them:&#160; I asked one of the Jews, and said, What is it they are shouting in Hebrew?&#160; And he interpreted it for me.&#160; Pilate says to them:&#160; And what did they shout in Hebrew?&#160; The Jews say to him:&#160; <span class="c9"><a name="vii.xii.ii-p11.1"></A>Hosanna membrome Baruchamma Adona&iuml;</span>.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1809"></A><A HREF="#fn_1809"><FONT SIZE="1">1810</FONT></A>
&#160; Pilate says to them:&#160; And this hosanna, etc., how is it interpreted?&#160; The Jews say to him:&#160; Save now in the highest; blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.&#160; Pilate says to them:&#160; If you bear witness to the words spoken by the children, in what has the runner done wrong?&#160; And they were silent.&#160; And the procurator says to the runner:&#160; Go out, and bring him in what way thou wilt.&#160; And the runner going out, did in the same manner as before, and says to Jesus:&#160; My lord, come in; the procurator calleth thee.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xii.ii-p13"></A>And Jesus going in, and the standard-bearers holding their standards, the tops of the standards were bent down, and adored Jesus.&#160; And the Jews seeing the bearing of the standards, how they were bent down and adored Jesus, cried&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1810"></A><A HREF="#fn_1810"><FONT SIZE="1">1811</FONT></A>
 out vehemently against the standard-bearers.&#160; And Pilate says to the Jews:&#160; Do you not wonder how the tops of the standards were bent down, and adored Jesus?&#160; The Jews say to Pilate:&#160; We saw how the standard-bearers bent them down, and adored him.&#160; And the procurator having called the standard-bearers, says to them:&#160; Why have you done this?&#160; They say to Pilate:&#160; We are Greeks and temple-slaves, and how could we adore him? and assuredly, as we were holding them up, the tops bent down of their own accord, and adored him.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xii.ii-p15"></A>Pilate says to the rulers of the synagogue and the elders of the people:&#160; Do you choose for yourselves men strong and powerful, and let them hold up the standards, and let us see whether they will bend down with them.&#160; And the elders of the Jews picked out twelve men powerful and strong, and made them hold up the standards six by six; and they were placed in front of the procurator&#146;s tribunal.&#160; And Pilate says to the runner:&#160; Take him outside of the pr&aelig;torium, and bring him in again in whatever way may please thee.&#160; And Jesus and the runner went out of the pr&aelig;torium.&#160; And Pilate, summoning those who had formerly held up the standards, says to them:&#160; I have sworn by the health of C&aelig;sar, that if the standards do not bend down when Jesus comes in, I will cut off your heads.&#160; And the procurator ordered Jesus to come in the second time.&#160; And the runner did in the same manner as before, and made many entreaties to Jesus to walk on his cloak.&#160; And He walked on it, and went in.&#160; And as He went in, the standards were again bent down, and adored Jesus.</p>
