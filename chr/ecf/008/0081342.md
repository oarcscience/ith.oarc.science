id="vii.xvii.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter 10 (26).</span>

<span id="vii.xvii.x-p2"></span>Then all the saints of God asked the
Lord to leave as a sign of victory the sign of His holy cross in the
lower world, that its most impious officers might not retain as an
offender any one whom the Lord had absolved.  And so it was done.  And
the Lord set His cross in the midst of Hades, which is the sign of
victory, and which will remain even to eternity.

<span id="vii.xvii.x-p3"></span>Then we all went forth thence along with
the Lord, leaving Satan and Hades in Tartarus.  And to us and many
others it was commanded that we should rise in the body, giving in the
world a testimony of the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ, and of
those things which had been done in the lower world.

<span id="vii.xvii.x-p4"></span>These are the things, dearest brethren,
which we have seen, and which, adjured by you, we testify, He bearing
witness who died for us, and rose again; because, as it was written, so
has it been done in all points.
