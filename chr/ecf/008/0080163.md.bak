id="vi.iii.iv.xxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVI.—Simon’s
Interruption.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iv.xxvi-p2"></span>When therefore Peter had begun to
continue his discourse, Simon, interrupting his speech, said:  “Why do
you hasten to speak whatever you please?  I understand your tricks.  You
wish to bring forward those matters whose explanation you have well
studied, that you may appear to the ignorant crowd to be speaking well;
but I shall not allow you this subterfuge.  Now therefore, since you
promise, as a brave man, to answer to all that any one chooses to bring
forward, be pleased to answer me in the first place.”  Then Peter said: 
“I am ready, only provided that our discussion may be with peace.”  Then
Simon said:  “Do not you see, O simpleton, that in pleading for peace
you act in opposition to your Master, and that what you propose is not
suitable to him who promises that he will overthrow ignorance?  Or, if
you are right in asking peace from the audience, then your Master was
wrong in saying, ‘I have not come to send peace on earth, but a
sword.’ <span id="fr_618"></span>[619](#fn_618.md)   For either you say
well, and he not well; or else, if your Master <span id="page_105">p.
105</span> <span id="vi.iii.iv.xxvi-Page_105"></span>said well, then you
not at all well:  for you do not understand that your statement is
contrary to his, whose disciple you profess yourself to be.”
