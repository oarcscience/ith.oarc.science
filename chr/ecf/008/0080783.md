Way.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xxii-p2"></span>“But let us pass over this now.  But
this we all know, that universally men are beyond measure enraged on
account of it, that wars have been waged, that there have been
overthrows of houses, and captures of cities, and myriads of other
evils.  On this account I betook myself to the holy God and law of the
Jews, putting my faith in the well-assured conclusion that the law has
been assigned by the righteous judgment of God, and that the soul must
at some time receive according to the desert of its deeds.”
