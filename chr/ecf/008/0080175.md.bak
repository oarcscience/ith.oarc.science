Creed.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iv.xxxviii-p2"></span>Then Peter:  “Are not you making
use of long preambles, as you accused us of doing, because you have no
truth to bring forward?  For if you have, begin without circumlocution,
if you have so much confidence.  And if, indeed, what you say be
displeasing to any one of the hearers, he will withdraw; and those who
remain shall be compelled by your assertion to approve what is true. 
Begin, therefore, to expound what seemeth to you to be right.”  Then
Simon said:  “I say that there are many gods; but that there is one
incomprehensible and unknown to all, and that He is the God of all these
gods.”  Then Peter answered:  “This God whom you assert to be
incomprehensible and unknown to all, can you prove His existence from
the Scriptures of the Jews, <span id="fr_629"></span>[630](#fn_629.md)
which are held to be of authority, or from some others of which we are
all ignorant, <span id="page_108">p. 108</span> <span
id="vi.iii.iv.xxxviii-Page_108"></span>or from the Greek authors, or
from your own writings?  Certainly you are at liberty to speak from
whatever writings you please, yet so that you first show that they are
prophetic; for so their authority will be held without question.”

the *Homilies* the contest turns upon the monotheistic teaching of the
Old Testament and the supreme Deity of Jehovah.  This is rightly
regarded as an evidence of Ebionitic origin.  But Gnostic elements enter
again and again.—R.\]
