Merchandise.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xii.viii-p2"></span>“Many forms of worship, <span
id="fr_1112"></span>[1113](#fn_1112.md) then, having passed away in the
world, we come, bringing to you, as good merchantmen, the worship that
has been handed down to us from our fathers, and preserved; showing you,
as it were, the seeds of plants, and placing them under your judgment
and in your power.  Choose that which seems good unto you.  If,
therefore, ye choose our wares, not only shall ye be able to escape
demons, and the sufferings which are inflicted by demons, but yourselves
also putting them to flight, and having them reduced to make
supplication to you, shall for ever enjoy future blessings.
