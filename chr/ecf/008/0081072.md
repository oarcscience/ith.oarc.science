<span id="vi.iv.xix.xx-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.xix.xx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XX.—The Character of God.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xix.xx-p2"></span>“Behold, then, the character of that
God to whom you, Simon, wish to persuade us to be ungrateful, and the
earth continues to bear you, perhaps wishing to see who will venture to
entertain similar opinions to yours.  For you were the first to dare
what no other dared:  you were the first to utter what we first heard. 
We first and alone have seen the boundless long-suffering of God in
bearing with such great impiety as yours, and that God no other than the
Creator of the world, against whom you have dared to act impiously.  And
yet openings of the earth took not place, and fire was not sent down
from heaven and went not forth to burn up men, and rain was not poured
out, <span id="fr_1306"></span>[1307](#fn_1306) and a multitude of
beasts was not sent from the thickets, and upon us ourselves the
destructive wrath of God did not begin to show itself, on account of one
who sinned the sin, as it were, of spiritual adultery, which is worse
than the carnal.  For it is not God the Creator of heaven and earth that
in former times punished sins, since now, when He is blasphemed in the
highest degree, He would inflict the severest punishment. <span
id="fr_1307"></span>[1308](#fn_1307)   But, on the contrary, He is
long-suffering, calls to repentance, having the arrows which end in the
destruction of the impious laid up in His treasures, which He will
discharge like living animals when He shall sit down to give judgment to
those that are His. <span id="fr_1308"></span>[1309](#fn_1308)  
Wherefore let us fear the just God, whose shape the body of man bears
for honour.”

<span id="vi.iv.xix.xx-p3"></span> One <span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iv.xix.xx-p3.1"></span>ms.</span> reads, “was not restrained.”

<span id="fn_1307"></span>[317:1308](0081072.htm#fr_1307) <span
id="vi.iv.xix.xx-p3.2"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.xix.xx-p4"></span> We have inserted <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.iv.xix.xx-p4.1"></span>ἄν</span>, and suppose
the sentence to be ironical.  The meaning might be the same without
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.iv.xix.xx-p4.2"></span>ἄν</span>.  The
text of Dressel is as follows:  “For is not He who then punished the
sins God, Creator of heaven and earth; since even now, being blasphemed
in the highest degree, He punished it in the highest degree?”

<span id="fn_1308"></span>[317:1309](0081072.htm#fr_1308) <span
id="vi.iv.xix.xx-p4.3"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.xix.xx-p5"></span> Cotelerius translates:  “to His
enemies.”
