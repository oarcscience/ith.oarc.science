Seen.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.ix.xxi-p2"></span>“For instance, as I have mentioned
already, in the Caucasian mountains there is shown the tomb of a certain
Kronos, a man, and a fierce monarch who slew his children.  And the son
of this man, called Zeus, became worse *than his father;* and having by
the power of magic been declared ruler of the universe, he committed
many adulteries, and inflicted punishment on his father and uncles, and
so died; and the Cretans show his tomb.  And in Mesopotamia there lie
buried a certain Helios at Atir, and a certain Selene at Carrhæ.  A
certain Hermes, a man, lies buried in Egypt; Ares in Thrace; Aphrodite
in Cyprus; Æsculapius in Epidaurus; and the tombs of many other such
persons are to be seen. <span id="fr_1076"></span>[1077](#fn_1076.md)
