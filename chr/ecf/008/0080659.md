id="vi.iv.v.xxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVI.—His Wickedness.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.v.xxvi-p2"></span>“For he even began to commit
murder <span id="fr_938"></span>[939](#fn_938.md) as himself disclosed to
us, as a friend to friends, that, having separated the soul of a child
from its own body by horrid incantations, as his assistant for the
exhibition of anything that he pleased, and having drawn the likeness of
the boy, he has it set up in the inner room where he sleeps, saying that
he once formed the boy of air, by divine arts, and having painted his
likeness, he gave him back again to the air.  And <span id="page_234">p.
234</span> <span id="vi.iv.v.xxvi-Page_234"></span>he explains that he
did the deed thus.  He says that the first soul of man, being turned
into the nature of heat, drew to itself, and sucked in the surrounding
air, after the fashion of a gourd; <span
id="fr_939"></span>[940](#fn_939.md) and then that he changed it into
water, when it was within the form of the spirit; and he said that he
changed into the nature of blood the air that was in it, which could not
be poured out on account of the consistency of the spirit, and that he
made the blood solidified into flesh; then, the flesh being thus
consolidated, that he exhibited a man not *made* from earth, but from
air.  And thus, having persuaded himself that he was able to make a new
*sort of* man, he said that he reversed the changes, and again restored
him to the air.  And when he told this to others, he was believed; but
by us who were present at his ceremonies he was religiously
disbelieved.  Wherefore we denounced his impieties, and withdrew from
him.”
