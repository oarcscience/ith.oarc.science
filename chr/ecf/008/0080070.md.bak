<span id="vi.iii.iii.viii-p2"></span>Now, inasmuch as the people began
to assent willingly to the things which were sincerely spoken, and to
embrace his simple discourse, those who thought themselves learned or
philosophic began to laugh at the man, and to flout him, and to throw
out for him the grappling-hooks of syllogisms, like strong arms.  But
he, unterrified, regarding their subtleties as mere ravings, did not
even judge them worthy of an answer, but boldly pursued the subject
which he had set before him.  At length, some one having proposed this
question to him as he was speaking, Why a gnat has been so formed, that
though it is a small creature, and has six feet, yet it has got wings in
addition; whereas an elephant, though it is an immense animal, and has
no wings, yet has only four feet; he, paying no attention to the
question, went on with his discourse, which had been interrupted by the
unseasonable challenge, only adding this admonition at every
interruption:  “We have it in charge to declare to you the words and the
wondrous works of Him who hath sent us, and to confirm the truth of what
we speak, not by artfully devised arguments, but by witnesses produced
from amongst yourselves.  For I recognise many standing in the midst of
you whom I remember to have heard along with us the things which we have
heard, and to have seen what we have seen.  But be it in your option to
receive or to spurn the tidings which we bring to you.  For we cannot
keep back what we know to be for your advantage, because, if we be
silent, woe is to us; but to you, if you receive not what we speak,
destruction.  I could indeed very easily answer your foolish challenges,
if you asked for the sake of learning truth,—I mean as to the difference
of a gnat and an elephant; but now it were absurd to speak to you of
these creatures, when the very Creator and Framer of all things is
unknown by you.”
