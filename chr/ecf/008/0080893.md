Expelled.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xii.x-p2"></span>“But the reason why the demons delight
in entering into men’s bodies is this.  Being spirits, and having
desires after meats and drinks, and sexual pleasures, but not being able
to partake of these by reason of their being spirits, and wanting organs
fitted for their enjoyment, they enter into the bodies of men, in order
that, getting organs to minister to them, they may obtain the things
that they wish, whether it be meat, by means of men’s teeth, or sexual
pleasure, by means of men’s members.  Hence, in order to the putting of
demons to flight, the most useful help is abstinence, and fasting, and
suffering of affliction.  For if they enter into men’s bodies for the
sake of sharing *pleasures*, it is manifest that they are put to flight
by suffering.  But inasmuch as some, <span
id="fr_1113"></span>[1114](#fn_1113) being of a more malignant kind,
remain by the body that is undergoing punishment, though they are
punished with it, therefore it is needful to have recourse to God by
prayers and petitions, refraining from every occasion of impurity, that
the hand of God may touch him for his cure, as being pure and faithful.

<span id="vi.iv.xii.x-p3"></span> The gender is here changed, but the
sense shows that the reference is still to the demons.  I suppose the
author forgot that in the preceding sentences he had written <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.iv.xii.x-p3.1"></span>δαίμονες</span>
(*masc*.) and not <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.xii.x-p3.2"></span>δαιμόνια</span> (*neut*.).
