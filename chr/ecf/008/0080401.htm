<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.ix.xxxiv-p2"></A>When Niceta had spoken thus, our mother fell down at Peter&#146;s feet, entreating and beseeching him that both herself and her hostess might be baptized without delay; &#8220;that,&#8221; said she, &#8220;I may not even for a single day suffer the loss of the company and society of my sons.&#8221;&#160; In like manner, we her sons also entreated Peter.&#160; But he said:&#160; &#8220;What!&#160; Do you think that I alone am unpitiful, and that I do not wish you to enjoy your mother&#146;s society at meals?&#160; But she must fast at least one day first, and so be baptized; and this because I have heard from her a certain declaration, by which her faith has been made manifest to me, and which has given evidence of her belief; otherwise she must have been instructed and taught many days before she could have been baptized.&#8221;</p>
