<span id="vii.v.x-p2"></span>And on the second day, while Mary was at
the fountain to fill her pitcher, the angel of the Lord appeared to her,
saying:  Blessed art thou, Mary; for in thy womb thou hast prepared an
habitation for the Lord.  For, lo, the light from heaven shall come and
dwell in thee, and by means of thee will shine over the whole world.

<span id="vii.v.x-p3"></span>Again, on the third day, while she was
working at the purple with her fingers, there entered a young man of
ineffable beauty.  And when Mary saw him, she exceedingly feared and
trembled.  And he said to her:  Hail, Mary, full of grace; the Lord is
with thee:  blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of
thy womb. <span id="fr_1637"></span>[1638](#fn_1637.md)   And when she
heard these words, she trembled, and was exceedingly afraid.  Then the
angel of the Lord added:  Fear not, Mary; for thou hast found favour
with God:  Behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and shalt bring
forth a King, who fills not only the earth, but the heaven, and who
reigns from generation to generation.
