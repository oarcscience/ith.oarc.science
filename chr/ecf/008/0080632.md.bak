id="vi.iv.iv.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXII.—Thanksgiving.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xxii-p2"></span>When I had thus spoken, Peter said: 
“I give thanks to God, both for your salvation and for my satisfaction. 
For I am truly pleased to know that you apprehend what is the greatness
of prophecy.  Since, then, as you say, if I myself should ever
wish—which God forbid—to transfer you to another doctrine, I shall not
be able to persuade you, begin from to-morrow to attend upon me in the
discussions with the adversaries.  And to-morrow I have one with Simon
Magus.”  And having spoken thus, and he himself having partaken of food
in private, he ordered me also to partake; <span

having given thanks after being satisfied, and having giving me an
account of this matter, he went on to say:  “May God grant you in all
things to be made like unto me, and having been baptized, to partake of
the same table with me.”  And having thus spoken, he enjoined me to go
to rest; for now indeed my bodily nature demanded sleep.
