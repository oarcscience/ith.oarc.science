Subterfuges.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.v.xxxiii-p2"></span>Then says Simon:  “If you are
angry, I shall neither ask you any questions, nor do I wish to hear
you.”  Then Peter:  “If you are now seeking a pretext for escaping, you
have full liberty, and need not use any special pretext.  For all have
heard you speaking all amiss, and have perceived that you can prove
nothing, but that you only asked questions for the sake of
contradiction; which any one can do.  For what difficulty is there in
replying, after the clearest proofs have been adduced, ‘You have said
nothing to the purpose?’  But that you may know that I am able to prove
to you in a single sentence that the soul is immortal, I shall ask you
with respect to a point which all know; answer me, and I shall prove to
you in one sentence that it is immortal.”  Then Simon, who had thought
that he had got, from the anger of Peter, a pretext for departing,
stopped on account of the remarkable promise that was <span

then, and I shall answer you what all know, that I may hear in a single
sentence, as you have promised, how the soul is immortal.”
