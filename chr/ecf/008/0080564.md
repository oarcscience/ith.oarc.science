Transformation.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.xii.lvi-p2"></span>“All we, therefore, who went before
you, considered that in the meantime you should not go <span

to Antioch, till we see if the hatred of you which he has sown among the
people be in any degree lessened by his departure.”  When he who had
come from Antioch had imparted this information, Peter, looking to our
father, said, “Faustinianus, your countenance has been transformed by
Simon Magus, as is evident; for he, thinking that he was being sought
for by Cæsar for punishment, has fled in terror, and has placed his own
countenance upon you, if haply you might be apprehended instead of him,
and put to death, that so he might cause sorrow to your sons.”  But my
father, when he heard this, crying out, said with tears:  “You have
judged rightly, O Peter:  for Anubion also, who is very friendly with
me, began to inform me in a certain mysterious way of his plots; but
unhappily I did not believe him, because I had done him no harm.”
