<span id="vi.iv.xxiii.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.xxiii.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter III.—The Work of the Good One
and of the Evil One.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxiii.iii-p2"></span>“But of these two, *the one* <span
id="fr_1483"></span>[1484](#fn_1483.md) acts violently towards the other by
the command of God.  Moreover, each man has power to obey whichever of
them he pleases for the doing of good or evil.  But if any one chooses
to do what is good, he becomes the possession of the future good king;
but if any one should do evil, he becomes the servant of the present
evil one, who, having received power over him by just judgment on
account of his sins, and wishing *to use it* <span
id="fr_1484"></span>[1485](#fn_1484.md) before the coming age, rejoices in
punishing him in the present life, and thus by gratifying, as it were,
his own private passion, he accomplishes the will of God.  But the
other, being made to rejoice in power over the righteous, when he finds
a righteous man, is exceedingly glad, and saves him with eternal life;
and he also, as if gratifying himself, traces the gratification which he
feels on account of these to God.  Now it is within the power of every
unrighteous man to repent and be saved; and every righteous man may have
to undergo punishment for sins committed at the end of his career. 
Moreover, <span id="page_340">p. 340</span> <span
id="vi.iv.xxiii.iii-Page_340"></span>these two leaders are the swift
hands of God, eager to anticipate Him so as to accomplish His will.  But
that this is so, has been said even by the law in the person of God:  ‘I
will kill, and I will make alive; I will strike, and I will heal.’ <span
id="fr_1485"></span>[1486](#fn_1485.md)   For, in truth, He kills and makes
alive.  He kills through the left hand, that is, through the evil one,
who has been so composed as to rejoice in afflicting the impious.  And
he saves and benefits through the right hand, that is, through the good
one, who has been made to rejoice in the good deeds and salvation of the
righteous.  Now these have not their substances outside of God:  for
there is no other primal source.  Nor, indeed, have they been sent forth
as animals from God, for they were of the same mind with Him; nor are
they accidental, <span id="fr_1486"></span>[1487](#fn_1486.md) arising
spontaneously in opposition to His will, since thus the greatest
exercise of His power would have been destroyed.  But from God have been
sent forth the four first elements—heat and cold, moist and dry.  In
consequence of this, He is the father of every substance, but not of the
disposition <span id="fr_1487"></span>[1488](#fn_1487.md) which may arise
from the combination of the elements; for when these were combined from
without, disposition was begotten in them as a child.  The wicked one,
then, having served God blamelessly to the end of the present world, can
become good by a change in his composition, <span
id="fr_1488"></span>[1489](#fn_1488.md) since he assuredly is not of one
uniform substance whose sole bent is towards sin.  For not even more
does he do evil, although he is evil, since he has received power to
afflict lawfully.”
