<span id="vi.iv.xviii.i-p2"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.xviii.i-p2.1"></span>Chapter I.—Peter Wishes to Convert
Faustus.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xviii.i-p3"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iv.xviii.i-p3.1"></span>At</span> break of day our father, with
our mother and his three sons, entered the place where Peter was, and
accosting him, sat down.  Then we also did the same at his request; and
Peter looking at our father, said: <span
id="fr_1217"></span>[1218](#fn_1217.md)   “I am anxious that you should
become of the same mind as your wife and children, in order that here
you may live along with them, and in the other world, <span
id="fr_1218"></span>[1219](#fn_1218.md) after the separation of the soul
from the body, you will continue to be with them free from sorrow.  For
does it not grieve you exceedingly that you should not associate with
each other?”  And my <span id="page_309">p. 309</span> <span
id="vi.iv.xviii.i-Page_309"></span>father said:  “Most assuredly.”  And
Peter said:  “If, then, separation from each other here gives you pain,
and if without doubt the penalty awaits you that after death you should
not be with each other, how much greater will your grief be that you, a
wise man, should be separated from your own family on account of your
opinions?  They too, must <span id="fr_1219"></span>[1220](#fn_1219.md)
feel the more distressed from the consciousness that eternal punishment
awaits you because you entertain different opinions from theirs, and
deny the established truth.” <span id="fr_1220"></span>[1221](#fn_1220.md)

<span id="vi.iv.xviii.i-p6"></span> We have inserted a <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.iv.xviii.i-p6.1"></span>δεῖ</span>, probably
omitted on account of the previous <span class="Greek"><span

<span id="fn_1220"></span>[309:1221](0081041.htm#fr_1220.md) <span
id="vi.iv.xviii.i-p6.3"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.xviii.i-p7"></span> The words are peculiar.  Lit.,
“eternal punishment awaits you thinking other things, through denial of
the fixed dogma” (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.xviii.i-p7.1"></span>ῥητοῦ δόγματος</span>).  The Latin
translator gives:  “ob veri dogmatis negationem.”
