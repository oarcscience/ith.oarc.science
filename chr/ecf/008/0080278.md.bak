Maro.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.vi.ii-p2"></span>And when we had come to the house of
Maro, in which preparation had been made for Peter, he turned to the
crowd, and told them that he would address them the day after
to-morrow.  Therefore the brethren who had been sent before assigned
lodgings to all who had come with us.  Then, when Peter had entered into
the house of Maro, and was asked to partake of food, he answered that he
would by no means do so, until he had ascertained whether all those that
had accompanied him were provided with lodgings.  Then he learned from
the brethren who had been sent before, that the citizens had received
them not only hospitably, but with all kindness, by reason of their love
towards Peter; so much so, that several were disappointed because there
were no guests for them; for that all had made such preparations, that
even if many more had come, there would still have been a deficiency of
guests for the hosts, not of hosts for the guests.
