Propounded.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xvii-p2"></span>Then I set forth my purpose from the
beginning, and how I had spent myself upon difficult questions, and all
the things that I disclosed to you at the outset, so that I need not
write the same things again.  Then I said, “I hold myself in readiness
to journey with you; for this, I know not how, I gladly wish.  However,
I wish first to be convinced concerning the truth, that I may know
whether the soul is mortal or immortal; and whether, if it is eternal,
it is to be judged concerning the things which it hath done here.  Also,
whether there is anything that is righteous and well-pleasing to God;
and whether the world was made, and for what end it was made; and
whether it shall be dissolved; and if it shall be dissolved, whether it
shall be made better, or shall not be at all.”  And not to mention them
in detail, I said that I wished to learn these things, and things
consequent upon these.  And to this he answered:  “I shall shortly
convey to you, O Clement, the knowledge of the things that are; and even
now listen.
