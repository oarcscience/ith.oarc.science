id="vi.iii.viii.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI.—Inward and Outward
Cleansing.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.viii.xi-p2"></span>“Moreover, it is good, and tends to
purity, also to wash the body with water.  I call it good, not as if it
were that prime good of the purifying of the mind, but because this of
the washing of the body is the sequel of that good.  For so also our
Master rebuked some of the Pharisees and scribes, who seemed to be
better than others, and separated from the people, calling them
hypocrites, because they purified only those things which were seen of
men, but left defiled and sordid their hearts, which God alone sees.  To
some therefore of them—not to all—He said, ‘Woe to you, scribes and
Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye cleanse the outside of the cup and
platter, but the inside is full of pollution.  O blind Pharisees, first
make clean what is within, and what is without shall be clean
also.’ <span id="fr_784"></span>[785](#fn_784.md)   For truly, if the mind
be purified by the light of knowledge, when once it is clean and clear,
then it necessarily takes care of that which is without a man, that is,
his flesh, that it also may be purified.  But when that which is
without, the cleansing of the flesh, is neglected, it is certain that
there is no care taken of the purity of the mind and the cleanness of
the heart.  Thus therefore it comes to pass, that he who is clean
inwardly is without doubt cleansed outwardly also, but not always that
he who is clean outwardly is also cleansed inwardly—to wit, when he does
these things that he may please men.
