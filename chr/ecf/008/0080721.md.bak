<span id="vi.iv.vi.xxxiv-p2"></span>“O the great hand of the wise God,
which doeth all in all!  For a countless multitude of birds have been
made by Him, and those various, differing in all respects from one
another; I mean in respect of their colours, beaks, talons, looks,
senses, voices, and all else.  And how many different species of plants,
distinguished by boundless variety of colours, qualities, and scents! 
And how many animals on the land and in the water, of which it were
impossible to tell the figures, forms, habitats, colour, food, senses,
natures, multitude!  Then also the multitude and height of mountains,
the varieties of stones, awful caverns, fountains, rivers, marshes,
seas, harbours, islands, forests, and all the inhabited world, and
places uninhabited!
