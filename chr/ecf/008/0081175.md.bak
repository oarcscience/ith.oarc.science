<span id="vii.iii.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vii.iii.iii-p1.1"></span>Part III.—Apocryphal Apocalypses.</span>

<span id="vii.iii.iii-p2"></span>This portion of the volume, extending
from page 565 to page 598, consists of seven documents, four of which
are called Apocalypses by their authors.  Of these, the Greek text of
the first three is edited for the first time; the fourth, the Apocalypse
of John, has appeared before.  The fifth, The Falling Asleep of Mary,
appears for the first time in its Greek form, and in the first Latin
recension of it.

<span id="vii.iii.iii-p3"></span>The <span class="c9"><span
id="vii.iii.iii-p3.1"></span>mss.</span> of these documents are
characterized by extreme variety of readings; and in some of them,
especially the earlier portion of the Apocalypse of Esdras, the text is
in a very corrupt state.

<span id="vii.iii.iii-p4"></span>I.  *The Apocalypse of Moses*.—This
document belongs to the Apocrypha of the Old Testament rather than that
of the New.  We have been unable to find in it any reference to any
Christian writing.  In its form, too, it appears to be a portion of some
larger work.  Parts of it at least are of an ancient date, as it is very
likely from this source that the writer of the Gospel of Nicodemus took
the celebrated legend of the Tree of Life and the Oil of Mercy.  An
account of this legend will be found in Cowper’s *Apocryphal Gospels*,
xcix.–cii.; in Maury, *<span id="vii.iii.iii-p4.1"></span>Croyances et
Légendes de l’Antiquité*, p. 294; in Renan’s commentary to the Syriac
text of the Penitence of Adam, edited and translated by Renan in the
*Journal Asiatique* for 1853.  There appeared a poetical rendering of
the legend in *Blackwood’s Magazine* ten or twelve years ago.

<span id="vii.iii.iii-p5"></span>Tischendorf’s text is made from four
<span class="c9"><span id="vii.iii.iii-p5.1"></span>mss.</span>:  A, a
Venice <span class="c9"><span id="vii.iii.iii-p5.2"></span>ms.</span> of
the thirteenth century; B and C, Vienna <span class="c9"><span
id="vii.iii.iii-p5.3"></span>mss.</span> of the thirteenth and twelfth
centuries respectively; and D, a Milan <span class="c9"><span
id="vii.iii.iii-p5.4"></span>ms.</span> of about the eleventh century.

<span id="vii.iii.iii-p6"></span>II.  *The Apocalypse of Esdras*.—This
book is a weak imitation of the apocryphal fourth book of Esdras. 
Thilo, in his prolegomena to the Acts of Thomas, p. lxxxii., mentions
it, and doubts whether it be the fourth book of Esdras or not.  Portions
of it were published by Dr. Hase of the Paris Library, and it was then
seen that it was a different production.  The <span class="c9"><span
id="vii.iii.iii-p6.1"></span>ms.</span> is of about the fifteenth
century, and in the earlier portions very difficult to read.

<span id="vii.iii.iii-p7"></span>III.  *The Apocalypse of Paul*.—There
are two apocryphal books bearing the name of Paul mentioned by ancient
writers:  The Ascension of Paul, adopted by the Cainites and the
Gnostics; and the Apocalypse of Paul, spoken of by Augustine and
Sozomen.  There seems to be no doubt that the present text, discovered
by Tischendorf in 1843, and published by him in 1866, is the book
mentioned by Augustine and Sozomen.  It is referred to by numerous
authorities, one of whom, however, ascribes it to the heretic Paul of
Samosata, the founder of the sect of the Paulicians.

<span id="vii.iii.iii-p8"></span>There appear to be versions of it in
Coptic, Syriac, and Arabic.  One of the Syriac versions, from an
Urumiyeh <span class="c9"><span id="vii.iii.iii-p8.1"></span>ms.</span>,
was translated into English by an American missionary in 1864.  This
translation, or the greater portion of it, is printed by Tischendorf
along with his edition of the text.

<span id="vii.iii.iii-p9"></span><span id="page_359">p. 359</span> <span
id="vii.iii.iii-Page_359"></span>Tischendorf, upon what seems to be
pretty good evidence, ascribes it to the year 380.  It is from a Milan
<span class="c9"><span id="vii.iii.iii-p9.1"></span>ms.</span> of not
earlier than the fifteenth century.  There is another <span
class="c9"><span id="vii.iii.iii-p9.2"></span>ms.</span> two centuries
older; but they both seem to be copied from the same original.  The
Syriac seems to be later than the Greek, and, according to Eastern
fashion, fuller in details.

<span id="vii.iii.iii-p10"></span>IV.  *The Apocalypse of John*.—In the
scholia to the Grammar of Dionysius the Thracian, ascribed to the ninth
century, immediately after the ascription of the Apocalypse of Paul to
Paul of Samosata, there occurs the following statement:  ‘And there is
another called the Apocalypse of John the Theologian.  We do not speak
of that in the island of Patmos, God forbid, for it is most true; but of
a supposititious and spurious one.’  This is the oldest reference to
this Apocalypse.  Asseman says he found the book in Arabic in three
<span class="c9"><span id="vii.iii.iii-p10.1"></span>mss.</span>

<span id="vii.iii.iii-p11"></span>The document was first edited by Birch
in 1804, from a Vatican <span class="c9"><span
id="vii.iii.iii-p11.1"></span>ms.</span>, collated with a Vienna <span
class="c9"><span id="vii.iii.iii-p11.2"></span>ms. </span> For his
edition Tischendorf collated other five <span class="c9"><span
id="vii.iii.iii-p11.3"></span>mss.</span>, two of Paris, three of
Vienna, of from the fourteenth to the sixteenth century.

<span id="vii.iii.iii-p12"></span>Of other Apocalypses, Tischendorf in
his *Prolegomena* gives an abstract of the Apocalypse of Peter, the
Apocalypse of Bartholomew, the Apocalypse of Mary, and the Apocalypse of
Daniel.  The Apocalypse of Peter professes to be written by Clement. 
There is an Arabic <span class="c9"><span
id="vii.iii.iii-p12.1"></span>ms.</span> of it in the Bodleian Library. 
It is called the Perfect Book, or the Book of Perfection, and consists
of eighty-nine chapters, comprising a history of the world as revealed
to Peter, from the foundation of the world to the appearing of
Antichrist.

<span id="vii.iii.iii-p13"></span>The Apocalypse of Bartholomew, from a
<span class="c9"><span id="vii.iii.iii-p13.1"></span>ms.</span> in the
Paris Library, was edited and translated by Dulaurier in 1835.  The
translation appears in Tischendorf’s *Prolegomena*.

<span id="vii.iii.iii-p14"></span>The Apocalypse of Mary, containing her
descent to the lower world, appears in several Greek <span
class="c9"><span id="vii.iii.iii-p14.1"></span>mss. </span> It is of a
late date, the work of some monk of the middle ages.

<span id="vii.iii.iii-p15"></span>The Apocalypse of Daniel, otherwise
called the Revelation of the Prophet Daniel about the consummation of
the world, is also of a late date.  About the half of the Greek text is
given in the *Prolegomena*.  We have not thought it necessary to
translate it.

<span id="vii.iii.iii-p16"></span>V., VI., VII.  *The Assumption of
Mary*.—It is somewhat strange that the Greek text of this book, which
has been translated into several languages both of the East and the
West, is edited by Tischendorf for the first time.  He assigns it to a
date not later than the fourth century.  A book under this title is
condemned in the decree of Gelasius.  The author of the Second Latin
Form (see p. 595, note), writing under the name of Melito, ascribes the
authorship of a treatise on the same subject to Leucius.  This, however,
cannot be the book so ascribed to Leucius, as Pseudo-Melito affirms that
his book, which is in substance the same as the Greek text, was written
to condemn Leucius’ heresies.

<span id="vii.iii.iii-p17"></span>There are translations or recensions
of our text in Syriac, Sahidic, and Arabic.  The Syriac was edited and
translated by Wright in 1865, in his *Contributions to the Apocryphal
Literature of the New Testament*.  Another recension of it was published
in the *Journal of Sacred Literature* for January and April, 1864.  An
Arabic version of it, resembling more the Syriac than the Greek or
Latin, was edited and translated by Enger in 1854.  The Sahidic
recension, published and translated by Zoega and Dulaurier, is
considerably different from our present texts.  The numerous Latin
recensions also differ considerably from each other, as will be seen
from a comparison of the First Latin Form with the Second.  They are
all, however, from the same source, and that probably the Greek text
which we have translated.  The Greek texts, again, exhibit considerable
variations, especially in the latter portions.

<span id="vii.iii.iii-p18"></span>In the end of the seventh century,
John Archbishop of Thessalonica wrote a discourse on the falling asleep
of Mary, mainly derived from the book of Pseudo-John; and in some <span
class="c9"><span id="vii.iii.iii-p18.1"></span>mss.</span> this treatise
of John of Thessalonica is ascribed to John the Apostle.  Epiphanius,
however, makes distinctive mention of both treatises.

<span id="vii.iii.iii-p19"></span><span id="page_360">p. 360</span>
<span id="vii.iii.iii-Page_360"></span>For his edition of the Greek
text, Tischendorf made use of five <span class="c9"><span
id="vii.iii.iii-p19.1"></span>mss.</span>, the oldest of the eleventh
century.

<span id="vii.iii.iii-p20"></span>The First Latin Form is edited from
three Italian <span class="c9"><span
id="vii.iii.iii-p20.1"></span>mss.</span>, the oldest of the thirteenth
century.

<span id="vii.iii.iii-p21"></span>The Second Latin Form, which has been
previously published elsewhere, is from a Venetian <span
class="c9"><span id="vii.iii.iii-p21.1"></span>ms.</span> of the
fourteenth century.

<span id="vii.iii.iii-p22"></span>We have now concluded our notices,
compiled chiefly from Tischendorf’s *Prolegomena*, of the Apocryphal
Literature of the New Testament.

<span id="vii.iii.iii-p23"></span>While these documents are of
considerable interest and value, as giving evidence of a widespread
feeling in early times of the importance of the events which form the
basis of our belief, and as affording us curious glimpses of the state
of the Christian conscience, and of modes of Christian thought, in the
first centuries of our era, the predominant impression which they leave
on our minds is a profound sense of the immeasurable superiority, the
unapproachable simplicity and majesty, of the Canonical Writings.
