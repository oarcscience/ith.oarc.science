reasonable difference of other animals, and each one being suited to its
own use and service.  This also is testified by the variety of trees and
the diversity of herbs, varying both in form and in juices.  This also
is asserted by the change of seasons, distinguished into four periods,
and the circle closing the year with certain hours, days, months, and
not deviating from the appointed reckoning by a single hour.  Hence, in
short, the age of the world itself is reckoned by a certain and fixed
account, and a definite number of years.
