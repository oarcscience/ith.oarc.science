Confessed.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.viii.xxviii-p2"></span>“When I heard this, I said to
Appion:  ‘Now I shall confess the truth to you.  I was not enamoured of
the woman, or of any one else, my soul being exceedingly spent upon
other desires, and upon the investigation of true doctrines.  And till
now, although I have examined many doctrines of philosophers, I have
inclined to none of them, excepting only that of the Jews,—a certain
merchant of theirs having sojourned here in Rome, selling linen clothes,
and a fortunate meeting having set simply before me the doctrine of the
unity of God.’
