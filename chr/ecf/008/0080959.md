id="vi.iv.xiv.xxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXV.—Good Works to Be Well
Done.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xiv.xxv-p2"></span>“Wherefore come readily, as a son to
a father, that God may assign ignorance as the cause of your sins.  But
if after being called you will not, or delay, you shall be destroyed by
the just judgment of God, not being willed, through your not willing. 
And do not think, though you were more pious than all the pious that
ever were, but if you be unbaptized, that you shall ever obtain hope. 
For all the more, on this account, you <span id="page_290">p. 290</span>
<span id="vi.iv.xiv.xxv-Page_290"></span>shall endure the greater
punishment, because you have done excellent works not excellently.  For
well-doing is excellent when it is done as God has commanded.  But if
you will not be baptized according to His pleasure, you serve your own
will and oppose His counsel.
