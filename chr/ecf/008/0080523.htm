<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.xii.xv-p2"></A>Then I Clement went on to speak thus:&#160; &#8220;At Tripolis, when you were disputing against the Gentiles, my lord Peter, I greatly wondered at you, that although you were instructed by your father according to the fashion of the Hebrews and in observances of your own law, and were never polluted by the studies of Greek learning, you argued so magnificently and so incomparably; and that you even touched upon some things concerning the histories of the gods, which are usually declaimed in the theatres.&#160; But as I perceived that their fables and blasphemies are not so well known to you, I shall discourse upon these in your hearing, repeating them from the very beginning, if it please you.&#8221;&#160; Then says Peter:&#160; &#8220;Say on; you do well to assist my preaching.&#8221;&#160; Then said I:&#160; &#8220;I shall speak, therefore, because you order me, not by way of teaching you, but of making public what foolish opinions the Gentiles entertain of the gods.&#8221;</p>
