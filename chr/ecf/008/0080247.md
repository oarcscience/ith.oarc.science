id="vi.iii.v.xxxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLVII.—Simon’s Vaunt.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.v.xxxvii-p2"></span>“I am the first power, who am
always, and without beginning. <span id="fr_698"></span>[699](#fn_698)  
But having entered the womb of Rachel, I was born of her as a man, that
I might be visible to men.  I have flown through the air; I have been
mixed with fire, and been made one body with it; I have made statues to
move; I have animated lifeless things; I have made stones bread; I have
flown from mountain to mountain; I have moved from place to place,
upheld by angels’ hands, and have lighted on the earth.  Not only have I
done these things; but even now I am able to do them, that by facts I
may prove to all, that I am the Son of God, enduring to eternity, and
that I can make those who believe on me endure in like manner for ever. 
But your words are all vain; nor can you perform any real works *such as
I have now mentioned*, <span id="page_127">p. 127</span> <span
id="vi.iii.v.xxxvii-Page_127"></span>as he also who sent you is a
magician, who yet could not deliver himself from the suffering of the
cross.”
