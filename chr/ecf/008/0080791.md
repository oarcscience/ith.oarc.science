<span id="vi.iv.viii.iv-p2"></span>“‘Whence, if you also suffer any such
thing after the manner of men, use freedom with me with all security;
for within seven days I shall put you fully in possession of her.’  When
I heard this, looking at the object I had in view, I said:  ‘Pardon me
that I do not altogether believe in the existence of magic; for I have
already tried many who have made many promises, and have deceived me. 
However, your undertaking influences me, and leads me to hope.  But when
I think of the matter, I am afraid that the demons are sometimes not
subject to the magicians with respect to the things that are commanded
them.’
