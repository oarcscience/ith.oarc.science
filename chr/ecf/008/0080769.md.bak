<span id="vi.iv.vii.viii-p2"></span>I answered:  “I accept, indeed, your
kindly affection towards me, but I take exception to your ignorance. 
For your affection is kindly, because you wish to continue in those
*customs* which you consider to be good.  But your inaccurate knowledge
strives to lay a snare for me, under the guise of friendship.”  Then
said Appion:  “Does it seem to you to be ignorance, that one should
observe the customs of his fathers, and judge after the manner of the
Greeks?”  Then I answered:  “It behoves one who desires to be pious not
altogether to observe the customs of his fathers; but to observe them if
they be pious, and to shake them off if they be impious.  For it is
possible that one who is the son of an impious father, if he wishes to
be pious, should not desire to follow the religion of his father.” <span

then?  Do you say that your father was a man of an evil life?”  Then
said I:  “He was not of an evil life, but of an evil opinion.”  Then
Appion:  “I should like to know what was his evil apprehension.”  Then
said I:  “Because he believed the false and wicked myths of the
Greeks.”  Then Appion asked:  “What are these false and evil myths of
the Greeks?”  Then I said:  “The wrong opinion concerning the gods,
which, if you will bear with me, you shall hear, with those who are
desirous to learn.
