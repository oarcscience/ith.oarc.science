<span id="vii.v.xxxiii-p2"></span>After these things, Joseph and Mary
departed thence with Jesus into the city of Nazareth; and He remained
there with His parents.  And on the first of the week, when Jesus was
playing with the children on the roof of a certain house, it happened
that one of the children pushed another down from the roof to the
ground, and he was killed.  And the parents of the dead boy, who had not
seen this, cried out against Joseph and Mary, saying:  Your son has
thrown our son down to the ground, and he is dead.  But Jesus was
silent, and answered them nothing.  And Joseph and Mary came in haste to
Jesus; and His mother asked Him, saying:  My lord, tell me if thou didst
throw him down.  And immediately Jesus went down from the roof to the
ground, and called the boy by his name, Zeno.  And he answered Him:  My
lord.  And Jesus said to him:  Was it I that threw thee down from the
roof to the ground?  And he said:  No, my lord.  And the parents of the
boy who had been dead wondered, and honoured Jesus for the miracle that
had been wrought.  And Joseph and Mary departed thence with Jesus to
Jericho.
