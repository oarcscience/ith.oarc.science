<span id="vi.iv.xviii.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.xviii.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter IX.—Possessions are
Transgressions.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xviii.ix-p2"></span>“Will you be so good as to explain
this matter also?  I remember Clement saying to me, that we suffer
injuries and afflictions for the forgiveness of our sins.”  Peter said: 
“This is quite correct.  For we, who have chosen the future things, in
so far as we possess more goods than these, whether they be clothing, or
food or drink, or any other thing, possess sins, because we ought not to
have anything, as I explained to you a little ago.  To all of us
possessions are sins. <span id="fr_1242"></span>[1243](#fn_1242)   The
deprivation of these, in whatever way it may take place, is the removal
of sins.”  And our father said:  “That seems reasonable, as you
explained that these were the two boundary lines of the two kings,
and <span id="fr_1243"></span>[1244](#fn_1243) that it was in the power
of each to choose whatever he wished of what was under their authority. 
But why are the afflictions sent, or <span
id="fr_1244"></span>[1245](#fn_1244) do we suffer them justly?”  And
Peter said:  “Most justly; for since the boundary line of the saved is,
as I said, that no one should possess anything, but since many have many
possessions, or in other words sins, for this reason the exceeding love
of God sends afflictions on those who do not act in purity of heart,
that on account of their having some measure of the love of God, they
might, by temporary inflictions, be saved from eternal punishments.”
