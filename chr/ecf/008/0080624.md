<span id="vi.iv.iv.xiv-p2"></span>But it plainly appeared to me that he
was disconcerted.  For when I said to him, “Only set forth to me the
words which you have heard of the Man who has appeared, and I will adorn
them with my speech, and preach the counsel of God; and if you do so,
within a few days I will sail with you, for I greatly desire to go to
the land of Judæa, and perhaps I shall dwell with you all my life;”—when
he heard this, he answered:  “If you wish to inquire into our affairs,
and to learn what is for your advantage, sail with me at once.  But if
you will not, I shall now give you directions to my house, and that of
those whom you wish *to meet*, that when you choose to come you may find
us.  For I shall set out to-morrow for my home.”  And when I saw that he
could not be prevailed upon, I went with him as far as the harbour; and
having learned of him the directions which he had promised to give me
for finding the dwellings, I said to him, “Were it not that to-morrow I
am to recover a debt that is due to me, I should straightway set sail
with you.  But I shall soon overtake you.”  And having said this, and
having given him in charge to those who commanded the ship, I returned
grieving, remembering him as an excellent and dear friend.
