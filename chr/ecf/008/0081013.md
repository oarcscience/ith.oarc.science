id="vi.iv.xvi.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—Nicetas Like to Be
Deceived by Simon Magus.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xvi.viii-p2"></span>“We were brought up along with one
Simon, a magician; and in consequence of our friendly intercourse with
him, we were in danger of being <span id="page_302">p. 302</span> <span
id="vi.iv.xvi.viii-Page_302"></span>led astray.  Now there is a report
in regard to some man, that, when he appears, the mass of those who have
been pious are to live free from death and pain in his kingdom.  This
matter, however, mother, will be explained more fully at the proper
time.  But when we were going to be led astray by Simon, a friend of our
lord Peter, by name Zacchæus, came to us and warned us not to be led
astray by the magician; and when Peter came, he brought us to him that
he might give us full information, and convince us in regard to those
matters that related to piety.  Wherefore we beseech you, mother, to
partake of those blessings which have been vouchsafed to us, that we may
unite around the same table! <span id="fr_1167"></span>[1168](#fn_1167.md)
  This, then, is the reason, mother, why you thought we were dead.  On
that disastrous night we had been taken up in the sea by pirates, but
you supposed that we had perished.”
