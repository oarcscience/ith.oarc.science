id="vi.iv.xxiii.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVI.—Why Simon Gave to Faustus
His Own Shape.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxiii.xvi-p2"></span>And my father said:  “I have
sinned; I confess it.”  And Annubion said:  “I also along with him beg
you to forgive the noble and good old man who has been deceived:  for
the unfortunate man has been the sport of that notorious fellow.  But I
shall tell you how it took place. <span
id="fr_1528"></span>[1529](#fn_1528.md)   The good old man came to salute
us.  But at that very hour we who were there happened to be listening to
Simon, who wished to run away that night, for he had heard that some
people had come to Laodicea in search of him by the command of the
emperor.  But as Faustus was entering, he *turned* <span
id="fr_1529"></span>[1530](#fn_1529.md) his own rage on him, and thus
addressed us:  ‘Make him, when he comes, share your meals; and I will
prepare an ointment, so that, when he has supped, he may take some of
it, and anoint his face with it, and then he will appear to all to have
my shape.  But I will anoint you with the juice <span
id="fr_1530"></span>[1531](#fn_1530.md) of some plant, and then you will
not be deceived by his new <span id="fr_1531"></span>[1532](#fn_1531.md)
shape; but to all others Faustus will seem to be Simon.’
