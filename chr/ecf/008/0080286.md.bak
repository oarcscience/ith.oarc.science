Suffering.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.vi.x-p2"></span>“But when men, leading a life void of
distress, began to think that the continuance of good things was granted
them not by the divine bounty, but by the chance of things, and to
accept as a debt of nature, not as a gift of God’s goodness, their
enjoyment without any exertion of the delights of the divine
complaisance,—men, being led by these things into contrary and impious
thoughts, came at last, at the instigation of idleness, to think that
the life of gods was theirs by nature, without any labours or merits on
their part.  Hence they go from bad to worse, to believe that neither is
the world governed by the providence of God, nor is there any place for
virtues, since they knew that they themselves possessed the fulness of
ease and delights, without the assignment of any works previously, and
without any labours were treated as the friends of God.
