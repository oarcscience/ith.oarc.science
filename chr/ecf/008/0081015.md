<span id="vi.iv.xvi.x-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.xvi.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter X.—Mattidia Values Baptism
Aright.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xvi.x-p2"></span>And I said:  “Tell us what it was that
she said which made her faith manifest.”  And Peter, said:  “Her request
that her hostess and benefactress should be baptized along with her. 
For she would not have besought this to be granted to her whom she
loves, had she not herself first felt that baptism was a great gift. 
And for this reason I condemn many that, after being baptized, and
asserting that they have faith, they yet do nothing worthy of faith; nor
do they urge those whom they love—I mean their wives, or sons, or
friends—to be baptized. <span id="fr_1168"></span>[1169](#fn_1168)   For
if they had believed that God grants eternal life with good works on the
acceptance of baptism, <span id="fr_1169"></span>[1170](#fn_1169) they
without delay would urge those whom they loved to be baptized.  But some
one of you will say, ‘They do love them, and care for them.’  That is
nonsense.  For do they not, most assuredly, when they see them sick, or
led away along the road that ends in death, or enduring any other trial,
lament over them and pity them?  So, if they believed that eternal fire
awaits those who worship not God, they would not cease admonishing them,
or being in deep distress for them as unbelievers, if they saw them
disobedient, being fully assured that punishment awaits them.  But now I
shall send for the hostess, and question her as to whether she
deliberately accepts the law which is proclaimed through us; <span
id="fr_1170"></span>[1171](#fn_1170) and so, according to her state of
mind, shall we do what ought to be done.
