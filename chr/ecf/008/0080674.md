<span id="vi.iv.v.xli-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.v.xli-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLI.—Asking for Information, Not
Contradiction.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.v.xli-p2"></span>Then I Clement, hearing this, said: 
“Truly I rejoice, and I give thanks to God, who in all things doeth
well.  However, he knows that I shall be able to think nothing other
than that all <span id="page_237">p. 237</span> <span
id="vi.iv.v.xli-Page_237"></span>things are for God.  Wherefore do not
suppose that I ask questions, as doubting the words concerning
God, <span id="fr_947"></span>[948](#fn_947.md) or those that are to be
spoken, but rather that I may learn, and so be able myself to instruct
another who is ingenuously willing to learn.  Wherefore tell me what are
the falsehoods added to the Scriptures, and how it comes that they are
really false.”  Then Peter answered:  “Even although you had not asked
me, I should have gone on in order, and afforded you the exposition of
these matters, as I promised.  Learn, then, how the Scriptures
misrepresent Him in many respects, that you may know when you happen
upon them.
