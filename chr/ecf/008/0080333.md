id="vi.iii.vii.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIX.—His Second
Suggestion.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.vii.xix-p2"></span>“Again, the wicked serpent suggests
another opinion to men, which many of you are in the habit of bringing
forward,—that there is, as we say, one God, who is Lord of all; but
these also, they say, are gods.  For as there is one Cæsar, and he has
under him many judges,—for example, prefects, consuls, tribunes, and
other officers,—in like manner we think, that while there is one God
greater than all, yet still that these gods are ordained in this world,
after the likeness of those officers of whom we have spoken, subject
indeed to that greater God, yet ruling us and the things that are in
this world.  In answer to this, I shall show you how, in those very
things which you propose for deception, you are confuted by the reasons
of truth.  You say that God occupies the place of Cæsar, and those who
are called gods represent His judges and officers.  Hold then, as you
have adduced it, by the example of Cæsar; and know that, as one of
Cæsar’s judges or administrators, as prefects, proconsuls, generals, or
tribunes, may lawfully take the name of Cæsar,—or else both he who
should take it and those who should confer it should be destroyed
together,—so also in this case you ought to observe, that if any one
give the name of God to any but Himself, and he accept it, they shall
partake one and the same destruction, by a much more terrible fate than
the servants of Cæsar.  For he who offends against Cæsar shall undergo
temporal destruction; but he who offends against Him who is the sole and
true God, shall suffer eternal punishment, and that deservedly, as
having injured by a wrongful condition the name which is unique. <span

<span id="vi.iii.vii.xix-p3"></span> The writer means, that insult is
offered to that name which belongs to God alone by giving it to others,
and thus placing it in a position which is unjust to it.
