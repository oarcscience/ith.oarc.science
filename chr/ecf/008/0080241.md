<span id="vi.iii.v.xxxi-p2"></span>Then said Peter:  “This very thing
which draws you into incredulity, affords to us a certain conviction
that there shall be a judgment.  For since it is certain that God is
just, it is a necessary consequence that there is another world, in
which every one receiving according to his deserts, shall prove the
justice of God.  But if all men were now receiving according to their
deserts, we should truly seem to be deceivers when we say that there is
a judgment to come; and therefore this very fact, that in the present
life a return is not made to every one according to his deeds, affords,
to those who know that God is just, an indubitable proof that there
shall be a judgment.”  Then said Simon:  “Why, then, am I not persuaded
of it?”  Peter:  “Because you have not heard the true Prophet saying,
‘Seek first His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to
you.’ <span id="fr_694"></span>[695](#fn_694)   “Then said Simon: 
“Pardon me if I am unwilling to seek righteousness, before I know if the
soul is immortal.”  Then Peter:  “You also pardon me this one thing,
because I cannot do otherwise than the Prophet of truth has instructed
me.”  Then said Simon:  “It is certain that you cannot assert that the
soul is immortal, and therefore you cavil, knowing that if it be proved
to be mortal, the whole profession of that religion which you are
attempting to propagate will be plucked up by the roots.  And therefore,
indeed, I commend your prudence, while I do not approve your
persuasiveness; for you persuade many to embrace your religion, and to
submit to the restraint of pleasure, in hope of future good things; to
whom it happens that they lose the enjoyment of things present, and are
deceived with hopes of things future.  For as soon as they die, their
soul shall at the same time be extinguished.”
