<span id="vi.iv.v.xlvi-p2"></span>“This is our Judge, to whom it behoves
us to look. and to regulate our own souls, thinking all things in His
favour, speaking well of Him, persuaded that by His long-suffering He
brings to light the obstinacy of all, and is alone good.  And He, at the
end of all, shall sit as a just Judge upon every one of those who have
attempted what they ought not.”
