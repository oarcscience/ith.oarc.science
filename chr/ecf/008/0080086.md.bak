id="vi.iii.iii.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIV.—Repetition
Continued.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iii.xxiv-p2"></span>“There always was, there is now,
and there ever shall be, that by which the first Will be<span
id="page_84">p. 84</span> <span
id="vi.iii.iii.xxiv-Page_84"></span>gotten from eternity consists; and
from the first Will *proceeds* a second Will.  After these came the
world; and from the world came time:  from this, the multitude of men;
from the multitude the election of the beloved, from whose oneness of
mind the peaceful kingdom of God is constructed.  But the rest, which
ought to follow these, you promised to tell me at another time.  After
this, when you had explained about the creation of the world, you
intimated the decree of God, “which He, of His own good pleasure,
announced in the presence of all the first angels,” and which He
ordained as an eternal law to all; and how He established two
kingdoms,—I mean that of the present time and that of the future,—and
appointed times to each, and decreed that a day of judgment should be
expected, which He determined, in which a severance is to be made of
things and of souls:  so that the wicked indeed shall be consigned to
eternal fire for their sins; but those who have lived according to the
will of God the Creator, having received a blessing for their good
works, effulgent with brightest light, introduced into an eternal abode,
and abiding in incorruption, shall receive eternal gifts of ineffable
blessings.”
