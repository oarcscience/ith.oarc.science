id="vi.iii.vi.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVII.—The Gospel Gives Power
Over Demons.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.vi.xvii-p2"></span>“You see, then, how important is the
acknowledgment of God, and the observance of the divine religion, which
not only protects those who believe from the assaults of the demon, but
also gives them command over those who rule over others.  And therefore
it is necessary for you, who are of the Gentiles, to betake yourselves
to God, and to keep yourselves from all uncleanness, that the demons may
be expelled, and God may dwell in you.  And at the same time, by
prayers, commit yourselves to God, and call for His aid against the
impudence of the demons; for ‘whatever things ye ask, believing, ye
shall receive.’ <span id="fr_735"></span>[736](#fn_735.md)   But even the
demons themselves, in proportion as they see faith grow in a man, in
that proportion they depart from him, residing only in that part in
which something of infidelity still remains; but from those who believe
with full faith, they depart without any delay.  For when a soul has
come to the faith of God, it obtains the virtue of heavenly water, by
which it extinguishes the demon like a spark of fire.
