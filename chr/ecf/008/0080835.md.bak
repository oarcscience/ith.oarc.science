id="vi.iv.ix.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVII.—They are Blameworthy Who
Invented Such Stories.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.ix.xvii-p2"></span>“Now, <span
id="fr_1075"></span>[1076](#fn_1075.md) since these things can be clearly,
profitably, and without prejudice to piety, set forth in an open and
straightforward manner, I wonder you call those men sensible and wise
who concealed them under crooked riddles, and over<span id="page_266">p.
266</span> <span id="vi.iv.ix.xvii-Page_266"></span>laid them with
filthy stories, and thus, as if impelled by an evil spirit, deceived
almost all men.  For either these things are not riddles, but real
crimes of the gods, in which case they should not have been exposed to
contempt, nor should these their needs have been set before men at all
as models; or things falsely attributed to the gods were set forth in an
allegory, and then, Appion, they whom you call wise erred, in that, by
concealing under unworthy stories things in themselves worthy, they led
men to sin, and that not without dishonouring those whom they believed
to be gods.
