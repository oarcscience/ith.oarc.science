<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.v.xxxv-p2"></A>But Simon hearing this, and being smitten by his conscience, changed colour and became bloodless; for he was afraid, if he denied it, that his house would be searched, or that Peter in his indignation would betray him more openly, and so all would learn what he was.&#160; Thus he answered:&#160; &#8220;I beseech thee, Peter, by that good God who is in thee, to overcome the wickedness that is in me.&#160; Receive me to repentance, and you shall have me as an assistant in your preaching.&#160; For now I have learned in very deed that you are a prophet of the true God, and therefore you alone know the secret and hidden things of men.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_697"></A><A HREF="#fn_697"><FONT SIZE="1">698</FONT></A>
&#160; Then said Peter:&#160; &#8220;You see, brethren, Simon seeking repentance; in a little while you shall see him returning again to his infidelity.&#160; For, thinking that I am a prophet, forasmuch as I have disclosed his wickedness, which he supposed to be secret and hidden, he has promised that he will repent.&#160; But it is not lawful for me to lie, nor must I deceive, whether this infidel be saved or not saved.&#160; For I call heaven and earth to witness, that I spoke not by a prophetic spirit what I said, and what I intimated, as far as was possible, to the listening crowds; but I learned from some who once were his associates in his works, but have now been converted to our faith, what things he did in secret.&#160; Therefore I spoke what I knew, not what I foreknew.&#8221;</p>
