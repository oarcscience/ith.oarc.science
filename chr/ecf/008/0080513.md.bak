id="vi.iii.xii.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V.—Good and Evil.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.xii.v-p2"></span>Then the old man said:  “There is a
saying very prevalent among the Greek philosophers, to the effect that
there is in reality neither good nor evil in the life of man; but that
men call things good or evil as they appear to them, prejudiced by the
use and custom of life.  For not even murder is really an evil, because
it sets the soul free from the bonds of the flesh.  Further, they say
that even just judges put to death those who commit crimes; but if they
knew homicide to be an evil, just men would not do that.  Neither do
they say that adultery is an evil; for if the husband does not know, or
does not care, there is, they say, no evil in it.  But neither, say they
is theft an evil; for it takes away what one does not possess from
another who has it.  And, indeed, it ought to be taken freely and
openly; but in that it is done secretly, that is rather a reproof of his
inhumanity from whom it is secretly taken.  For all men ought to have
the common <span id="page_194">p. 194</span> <span
id="vi.iii.xii.v-Page_194"></span>use of all things that are in this
world; but through injustice one says that this is his, and another that
that is his, and so division is caused among men.  In short, a certain
man, the wisest among the Greeks, <span
id="fr_857"></span>[858](#fn_857.md) knowing that these things are so, says
that friends should have all things common.  Now, in *all things*
unquestionably wives are included.  He says also that, as the air and
the sunshine cannot be divided, so neither ought other things to be
divided, which are given in this world to all to be possessed in common,
but should be so possessed.  But I wished to say this, because I am
desirous to turn to well-doing, and I cannot act well unless I first
learn what is good; and if I can understand that, I shall thereby
perceive what is evil, that is, opposite to good.
