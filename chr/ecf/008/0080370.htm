<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.ix.iii-p2"></A>When Peter thus spoke, they of course acquiesced, saying:&#160; &#8220;It does not greatly sadden us to do this, because we are ordered by you, who have been chosen by the foresight of Christ to do and to counsel well in all things; but also because, while it is a heavy loss not to see our lord Peter for one, or it may be two days, yet it is not intolerable.&#160; And we think of our twelve brethren who go before us, and who are deprived of the advantage of hearing and seeing you for a whole month out of the three that you stay in every city.&#160; Therefore we shall not delay doing as you order, because you order all things aright.&#8221;&#160; And thus saying, they went forward, having received instructions that they should speak to the brethren who journeyed with them outside the city, and request them not to enter the cities in a crowd and with tumult, but apart, and divided.</p>
