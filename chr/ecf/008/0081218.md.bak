id="vii.v.xli-p1.1"></span>Chapter 40.</span>

<span id="vii.v.xli-p2"></span>After these things Joseph departed thence
with Mary and Jesus to go into Capernaum by the sea-shore, on account of
the malice of his adversaries.  And when Jesus was living in Capernaum,
there was in the city a man named Joseph, exceedingly rich.  But he had
wasted away under his infirmity, and died, and was lying dead in his
couch.  And when Jesus heard them in the city mourning, and weeping, and
lamenting over the dead man, He said to Joseph:  Why dost thou not
afford the benefit of thy favour to this man, seeing that he is called
by thy name?  And Joseph answered him:  How have I any power or ability
to afford him a benefit?  And Jesus said to him:  Take the handkerchief
which is upon thy head, and go and put it on the face of the dead man,
and say to him:  Christ heal thee; and immediately the dead man will be
healed, and will rise from his couch.  And when Joseph heard this, he
went away at the command of Jesus, and ran, and entered the house of the
dead man, and put the handkerchief which he was wearing on his head upon
the face of him who was lying in the couch, and said:  Jesus heal thee. 
And forthwith the dead man rose from his bed, and asked who Jesus
was. <span id="fr_1686"></span>[1687](#fn_1686.md)
