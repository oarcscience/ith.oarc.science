<p class="c15"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p1"></A> <span class="c6"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p1.1"></A>A Homily on Guria and Shamuna, Composed by Mar Jacob.</span></p> 
<p class="c35"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p2"></A><span class="c9"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p2.1"></A>Shamuna</span> and Guria, martyrs who made themselves illustrious in their afflictions,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p3"></A>Have in love required of me to tell of their illustrious deeds.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p4"></A>To champions of the faith the doctrine calleth me,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p5"></A>That I should go and behold their contests and their crowns.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p6"></A>Children of the right hand, who have done battle against the left,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p7"></A>Have called me this day to recite the marvellous tale of their conflicts:&#8212;</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p8"></A>Simple old men, who entered into the fight like heroes,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p9"></A>And nobly distinguished themselves in the strife of blood:</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p10"></A>Those who were the salt of our land, and it was sweetened thereby,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p11"></A>And its savour was restored, which had become insipid through unbelief:</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p12"></A>Candlesticks of gold, which were full of the oil of the crucifixion,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p13"></A>By which was lighted up all our region, which had turned to darkness:</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p14"></A>Two lamps, of which, when all the winds were blowing</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p15"></A>Of every <i>kind of</i> error, the lights were not put out;</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p16"></A>Good labourers, who from the spring of day laboured</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p17"></A>In the blessed vineyard of the house of God right duteously:</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p18"></A>Bulwarks of our land, who became to us as it were a defence</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p19"></A>Against all spoilers in all the wars that surrounded us:</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p20"></A>Havens of peace, a place also of retreat for all that were distressed,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p21"></A>And a resting-place for the head of every one that was in need of succour:</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p22"></A>Two precious pearls, which were</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p23"></A>An ornament for the bride of my lord Abgar, the Aram&aelig;an&#146;s son.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p24"></A>Teachers they were who practised their teaching in blood,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p25"></A>And whose faith was known by their sufferings.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p26"></A>On their bodies they wrote the story of the Son of God</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p27"></A>With <i>the marks of</i> combs and scourges which thickly covered them.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p28"></A>They showed their love, not by words of the mouth alone,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p29"></A>But by tortures and by the rending of their limbs asunder.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p30"></A>For the love of the Son of God they gave up their bodies:</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p31"></A><A NAME="page_715"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 715</FONT></A> <a name="ix.xiv.ii-Page_715"></A>Since it beseemeth the lover that for his love he should give up himself.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p32"></A>Fire and sword proved their love, how true <i>it was;</i></p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p33"></A>And more beautiful than silver tried in <i>a furnace of</i> earth were their necks.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p34"></A>They looked on God, and, because they saw His exalted beauties,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p35"></A>Therefore did they look with contempt upon their sufferings for His sake.</p> 
<p><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p36"></A>The Sun of righteousness had arisen in their hearts;</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p37"></A>And they were enlightened by it, and with <i>His</i> light chased they away the darkness.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p38"></A>At the idols of vanity, which error had brought in, they laughed,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p39"></A>Instinct with the faith of the Son of God which is full of light.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p40"></A>The love of the Lord was as a fire in their hearts;</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p41"></A>Nor could all the brambles of idolatry stand before it.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p42"></A>Fixed was their love on God unchangeably:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3327"></A><A HREF="#fn_3327"><FONT SIZE="1">3328</FONT></A>
</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p44"></A>And therefore did they look with scorn upon the sword,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3328"></A><A HREF="#fn_3328"><FONT SIZE="1">3329</FONT></A>
 all athirst as it was for blood.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p46"></A>With guilelessness and <i>yet with</i> wisdom stood they in the judgment-hall,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p47"></A>As they had been commanded by the Teacher of that which is true.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p48"></A>Despising as they did kindred and family, guileless were they;</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p49"></A>Forasmuch, also, as possessions and wealth were held in no account by them.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p50"></A><i>Nor guileless only:</i>&#160; for in the judgment-hall with the wisdom of serpents <i>too</i></p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p51"></A>They were heedful of the faith of the house of God.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p52"></A>When a serpent is seized and struck, he guards his head,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p53"></A>But gives up and leaves exposed all his body to his captors:</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p54"></A>And, so long as his head is kept <i>from harm</i>, his life abideth in him;</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p55"></A>But, if the head be struck, his life is left <i>a prey</i> to destruction.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p56"></A>The head of the soul is men&#146;s faith;</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p57"></A>And, if this be preserved <i>unharmed</i>, by it is also preserved their life:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3329"></A><A HREF="#fn_3329"><FONT SIZE="1">3330</FONT></A>
</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p59"></A>Even though the whole body be lacerated with blows,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p60"></A><i>Yet</i>, so long as faith is preserved, the soul is alive;</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p61"></A>But, if faith is struck <i>down</i> by unbelief,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p62"></A>Lost is the soul, and life has perished from the man.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p63"></A>Shamuna and Guria of the faith as men&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3330"></A><A HREF="#fn_3330"><FONT SIZE="1">3331</FONT></A>
</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p65"></A>Were heedful, that it should not be struck <i>down</i> by persecutors:</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p66"></A>For they knew that, if faith is preserved,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p67"></A>Both soul and body are preserved from destruction.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p68"></A>And, because of this, touching their faith were they solicitous,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p69"></A>That that should not be struck <i>down</i> in which their very life was hidden.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p70"></A>They gave up their bodies both to blows and to dislocation,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3331"></A><A HREF="#fn_3331"><FONT SIZE="1">3332</FONT></A>
</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p72"></A>Yea to every <i>kind of</i> torture, that their faith should not be stricken <i>down;</i></p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p73"></A>And, even as the serpent also hides his head from blows,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p74"></A>So hid they their faith within their hearts;</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p75"></A>And the body was smitten, and endured stripes, and bore sufferings:</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p76"></A>But overthrown was not their faith which was within their hearts.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p77"></A>The mouth betrayeth the soul to death when it speaks,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p78"></A>And with the tongue, as with a sword, worketh slaughter.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p79"></A>And from it spring up both life and death to men:</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p80"></A>Denying <i>a man</i> dies, confessing he lives, and <i>the mouth</i> hath power over it.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p81"></A>Denial is death, and in confession is the soul&#146;s life;</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p82"></A>And power hath the mouth over them both, like a judge.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p83"></A>The word of the mouth openeth the door for death to enter in;</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p84"></A>This, too, calleth for life, and it beameth forth upon the man.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p85"></A>Even the robber by one word of faith</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p86"></A>Won him the kingdom, and became heir of paradise,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3332"></A><A HREF="#fn_3332"><FONT SIZE="1">3333</FONT></A>
 all fraught with blessings.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p88"></A>The wicked judges too, from the martyrs, the sons of the right hand,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p89"></A>Demanded that by word of mouth only they should blaspheme;</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p90"></A>But, like true men holding fast the faith,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p91"></A>They uttered not a word by which unbelief might be served.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p92"></A>Shamuna, beauty of our faith, who is adequate to <i>tell of</i> thee?</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p93"></A>All too narrow is my mouth for thy praise, too mean for thee to be spoken of by it.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p94"></A>Thy truth is thy beauty, thy crown thy suffering, thy wealth thy stripes,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p95"></A>And by reason of thy blows magnificent is the beauty of thy championship.</p> 
<p><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p96"></A><A NAME="page_716"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 716</FONT></A> <a name="ix.xiv.ii-Page_716"></A>Proud of thee is our country, as of a treasury which is full of gold:</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p97"></A>Since wealth art thou to us, and a coveted store which cannot be stolen <i>from us</i>.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p98"></A>Guria, martyr, staunch hero of our faith,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p99"></A>Who shall suffice thee, to recount thy beauties divine?</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p100"></A>Lo! tortures on thy body are set like gems of beryl,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p101"></A>And the sword on thy neck like a chain of choice gold.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p102"></A>Thy blood upon thy form is a robe of glory full of beauty,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p103"></A>And the scourging of thy back a vesture with which the sun may not compare.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p104"></A>Radiant thou art and comely by virtue of these thy sufferings, so abounding;</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p105"></A>And resplendent are thy beauties, because of the pains which are <i>so</i> severe upon thee.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p106"></A>Shamuna, our riches, richer art thou than the rich:</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p107"></A>For lo! the rich stand at thy door, that thou mayest relieve them.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p108"></A>Small thy village, poor thy country:&#160; who, then, gave thee</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p109"></A>That lords of villages and cities should court thy favour?</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p110"></A>Lo! judges in their robes and vestments</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p111"></A>Take dust from thy threshold, as <i>though it were</i> the medicine of life.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p112"></A>The cross is rich, and to its worshippers increaseth riches;</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p113"></A>And its poverty despiseth all the riches of the world.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p114"></A>Shamuna and Guria, sons of the poor, lo! at your doors</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p115"></A>Bow down the rich, that they may receive from you <i>supplies for</i> their wants.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p116"></A>The Son of God in poverty and want</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p117"></A>Showed to the world that all its riches are as nothing,</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p118"></A><i>His disciples</i>, all fishermen, all poor, all weak,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p119"></A>All men of little note, became illustrious through His faith.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p120"></A>One fisherman, whose &#8220;village&#8221; too was a home of fishermen,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3333"></A><A HREF="#fn_3333"><FONT SIZE="1">3334</FONT></A>
</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p122"></A>He made chief over the twelve, yea head of the house.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3334"></A><A HREF="#fn_3334"><FONT SIZE="1">3335</FONT></A>
</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p124"></A>One a tentmaker, who aforetime was a persecutor,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p125"></A>He seized upon, and made him a chosen vessel for the faith.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p126"></A>Shamuna and Guria came from villages that were not wealthy,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p127"></A>And lo! in a great city became they lords;</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p128"></A>And its chief men, its judges also, stand before their doors,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p129"></A>And they solicit their charity to satisfy their wants.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p130"></A>From their confession of the faith of the Son of God</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p131"></A>These blessed men acquired riches beyond compute.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p132"></A>Poor did He Himself become, and the poor made He rich;</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p133"></A>And lo! enriched is the whole creation through His poverty.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p134"></A>The chosen martyrs did battle against error,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p135"></A>And in the confession of the Son of God stood they firm like valiant men.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p136"></A>They went in and confessed Him before the judge with look undaunted,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3335"></A><A HREF="#fn_3335"><FONT SIZE="1">3336</FONT></A>
</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p138"></A>That He too might confess them, even as they confessed Him, before His Father.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p139"></A>There arose against them the war of pagans like a tempest;</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p140"></A>But the cross was their helmsman, and steered them on.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p141"></A>They were required to sacrifice to lifeless images,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p142"></A>But they departed not from their confession of the Son of God.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p143"></A>The wind of idolatry blew in their faces,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p144"></A>But they themselves were as rocks piled up against the hurricane.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p145"></A>Like a swift whirlwind, error snatched at them;</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p146"></A>But, forasmuch as they were sheltered by the crucifixion, it hurt them not.</p> 
<p><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p147"></A>The Evil One set on all his dogs to bark, that they might bite them;</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p148"></A>But, forasmuch as they had the cross for a staff, they put them all to flight.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p149"></A>But who is sufficient to tell of their contests,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p150"></A>Or their sufferings, or the rending asunder of their limbs?</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p151"></A>Or who can paint the picture of their coronation,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3336"></A><A HREF="#fn_3336"><FONT SIZE="1">3337</FONT></A>
</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p153"></A>How they went up from the contest covered with glory?</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p154"></A>To judgment they went in, but of the judge they took no account;</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p155"></A>Nor were they anxious what they should say when questioned.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p156"></A>The judge menaced <i>them</i>, and multiplied his words of threatening;</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p157"></A>And recounted tortures and all <i>kinds of</i> inflictions, that he might terrify them.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p158"></A>He spake great words,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3337"></A><A HREF="#fn_3337"><FONT SIZE="1">3338</FONT></A>
 that by fright and intimidation,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p160"></A>By menaces too, he might incline them to sacrifice.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p161"></A><A NAME="page_717"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 717</FONT></A> <a name="ix.xiv.ii-Page_717"></A>Yet the combatants despised the menaces, and the intimidations,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p162"></A>And the sentence of judgment, and all bodily deaths;</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p163"></A>And they prepared themselves for insult and stripes, and for blows,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p164"></A>And for provocation, and to be dragged along, and to be burnt;</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p165"></A>For imprisonment also, and for bonds, and for all evil things,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p166"></A>And for all tortures, and for all sufferings, rejoicing all the while.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p167"></A>They were not alarmed nor affrighted, nor dismayed,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p168"></A>Nor did the sharpness of the tortures bend them to sacrifice.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p169"></A>Their body they despised, and as dung upon the ground accounted they it:</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p170"></A>For they knew that, the more it was beaten, the more would its beauty increase;</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p171"></A>And, the more the judge increased his menaces to alarm them,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p172"></A>The more did they show their contempt of him, having no fear of his threats.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p173"></A>He kept telling them what tortures he had prepared for them;</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p174"></A>And they continued telling him about Gehenna which was reserved for him.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p175"></A>By those things which he told <i>them</i> he tried to frighten them to sacrifice;</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p176"></A>And they spoke to him about the fearful judgment yonder.</p>

<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p233"></A>All silent were the old men full of faith,</p>

<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p237"></A>But the old men, that they might not be thought to assent,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p238"></A>Expressed clearly by signs the word which it behoved them to speak.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p239"></A>Their heads they shook, and, instead of speech, by a dumb sign they showed</p>

<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p243"></A>As long as there was in them place for speech, with speech did they confess;</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p244"></A>But, when it was forbidden them by pain, they spake with a dumb sign.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p245"></A>Of faith they spoke both with the voice and without the voice:</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p246"></A>So that, when speaking and also when silent, they were <i>alike</i> stedfast.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p247"></A>Who but must be amazed at the path of life, how narrow it is,</p>

<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p256"></A>By a dumb sign only did the blessed men plainly signify that they would not sacrifice,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p257"></A>And in virtue of a single dumb sign did the path lead them to Eden;</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p258"></A>And, if this same dumb sign had inclined and turned down but a little</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p259"></A>Toward the depth, the path of the old men would have been to Gehenna.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p260"></A>Upwards they made a sign, <i>to signify</i> that upwards were they prepared to ascend;</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p261"></A>And in consequence of that sign they ascended and mingled with the heavenly ones.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p262"></A>Between sign and sign were Paradise and Gehenna:</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p263"></A>They made a sign that they would not sacrifice, and they inherited the place of the kingdom.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p264"></A>Even while they were silent they were advocates for the Son of God:</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p265"></A>For not in multitude of words doth faith consist.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p266"></A>That fortitude of theirs was a full-voiced confession,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p267"></A>And as though with open mouth declared they <i>their</i> faith by signs;</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p268"></A>And every one knew what they were saying, though silent,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p269"></A>And enriched and increased was the faith of the house of God;</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p270"></A>And error was put to shame by reason of two old men, who, though they spake not,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p271"></A>Vanquished it; and they kept silence, and their faith stood fast.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p272"></A>And, though tempestuous accents were heard from the judge,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p273"></A>And the commands of the emperor were dreadful, yea violent,</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p274"></A>And paganism had a bold face and an open mouth,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p275"></A>And its voice was raised, and silent were the old men with pain,</p>

<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p280"></A>And, by one mute sign with which the old men pointed above their heads,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p281"></A>The head of faith was lifted up, and error was put to shame.</p>

<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p284"></A>They took them down, because they had vanquished while silent;</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p285"></A>And they put them in bonds, threatening <i>yet</i> to vanquish them.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p286"></A>Bonds and a dungeon void of light were by the martyrs</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p287"></A>Held of no account&#8212;yea <i>rather</i> as the light which has no end.</p>

<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p297"></A>Bound fast was his person, but unfettered was his prayer over his deed.</p>
