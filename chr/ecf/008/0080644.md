id="vi.iv.v.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI.—Ignorance, Knowledge,
Foreknowledge.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.v.xi-p2"></span>“Wherefore, before all things, we must
test the Prophet with all judgment by means of the prophetic promise;
and having ascertained Him to be the Prophet, we must undoubtingly
follow the other words of His teaching; and having confidence concerning
things hoped for, we must conduct ourselves according to the first
judgment, knowing that He who tells us these things has not a nature to
lie.  Wherefore, if any of the things that are afterwards spoken by Him
do not appear to us to be well spoken, we must know that it is not that
it has been spoken amiss, but that it is that we have not conceived it
aright.  For ignorance does not judge knowledge, and so neither is
knowledge competent truly to judge foreknowledge; but foreknowledge
affords knowledge to the ignorant.
