<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.viii.xxvi-p2"></A>&#8220;&#145;For our mind, whenever it is impressed delightfully with the image of a beloved one, always seeing the form as in a mirror, is tormented by the recollection; and if it do not obtain its desire, it contrives ways of obtaining it; but if it do obtain it, it is rather increased, like fire having a supply of wood, and especially when there is no fear impressed upon the soul of the lover before the rise of passion.&#160; For as water extinguishes fire, so fear is the extinguisher of unreasonable desire.&#160; Whence I, having learned from a certain Jew both to understand and to do the things that are pleasing to God, am not to be entrapped into adultery by your lying fables.&#160; But may God help you in your wish and efforts to be chaste, and afford a remedy to your soul burning with love.&#146;</p>
