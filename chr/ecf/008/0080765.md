<span id="vi.iv.vii.iv-p2"></span>But Bernice, being asked, said: 
“These things are indeed as you have heard; and I will tell you other
things respecting this same Simon, which perhaps you do not know.  For
he astonishes the whole city every day, by making spectres and ghosts
appear in the midst of the market-place; and when he walks abroad,
statues move, and many shadows go before him, which, he says, are souls
of the dead.  And many who attempted to prove him an impostor he
speedily reconciled to him; and afterwards, under pretence of a banquet,
having slain an ox, and given them to eat of it, he infected them with
various diseases, and subjected them to demons.  And in a word, having
injured many, and being supposed to be a god, he is both feared and
honoured.” <span id="fr_1030"></span>[1031](#fn_1030.md)
