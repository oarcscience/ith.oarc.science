<span id="vi.iii.iv.xlix-p2"></span>Then Simon said:  “Remember that you
said that God has a son, which is doing Him wrong; for how can He have a
son, unless He is subject to passions, like men or animals?  But on
these points there is not time now to show your profound folly, for I
hasten to make a statement concerning the immensity of the supreme
light; and so now listen.  My opinion is, that there is a certain power
of immense and ineffable light, whose greatness may be held to be
incomprehensible, of which power even the maker of the world is
ignorant, and Moses the lawgiver, and Jesus your master.” <span
