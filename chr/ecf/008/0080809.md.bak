<span id="vi.iv.viii.xxii-p2"></span>“‘But those who will not subdue
base lusts belie the gods, that, by representing the gods as first doing
the things which they do, they may be set free from blame.  For if those
who are called gods committed adulteries for the sake of begetting
children, and not through lasciviousness, why did they also debauch
males?  But it is said they complimented their mistresses by making them
stars.  Therefore before this were there no stars, until such time as,
by reason of wantonness, the heaven was adorned with stars by
adulterers?  And how is it that the children of those who have been made
stars are punished in Hades,—Atlas loaded, Tantalus tortured with
thirst, Sisyphus pushing a stone, Tityus thrust through the bowels,
Ixion continually rolled round a wheel?  How is it that these divine
lovers made stars of the women whom they defiled, but gave no such grace
to these?
