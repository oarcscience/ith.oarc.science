<span id="vi.iv.xiv.iv-p2"></span>“Ye are the image of the invisible
God. <span id="fr_1126"></span>[1127](#fn_1126.md)   Whence let not those
who would be pious say that idols are images of God, and therefore that
it is right to worship them.  For the image of God is man.  He who
wishes to be pious towards God does good to man, because the body of man
bears the image of God.  But all do not as yet bear His likeness, but
the pure mind of the good soul does.  However, as we know that man was
made after the image and after the likeness of God, we tell you to be
pious towards him, that the favour may be accounted as done to God,
whose image he is.  Therefore it behoves you to give honour to the image
of God, which is man—in this wise:  food to the hungry, drink to the
thirsty, clothing to the naked, care to the sick, shelter to the
stranger, and visiting him who is in prison, to help him as you can. 
And not to speak at length, whatever good things any one wishes for
himself, so let him afford to another in need, and then a good reward
can be reckoned to him as being pious towards the image of God.  And by
like reason, if he will not undertake to do these things, he shall be
punished as neglecting the image.
