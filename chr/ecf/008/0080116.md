<span id="vi.iii.iii.liv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iii.iii.liv-p1.1"></span>Chapter LIV.—Jewish Sects.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iii.liv-p2"></span>“For when the rising of Christ was
at hand for the abolition of sacrifices, and for the bestowal of the
grace of baptism, the enemy, understanding from the predictions that the
time was at hand, wrought various schisms among the people, that, if
haply it might be possible to abolish the former sin, <span
id="fr_582"></span>[583](#fn_582) the latter fault might be
incorrigible.  The first schism, therefore, was that of those who were
called Sadducees, which took their rise almost in the time of John. 
These, as more righteous than others, began to separate themselves from
the assembly of the people, and to deny the resurrection of the
dead, <span id="fr_583"></span>[584](#fn_583) and to assert that by an
argument of infidelity, saying that it was unworthy that God should be
worshipped, as it were, under the promise of a reward.  The first author
of this opinion was Dositheus; <span id="fr_584"></span>[585](#fn_584)
the second was Simon.  Another schism is that of the Samaritans; for
<span id="page_92">p. 92</span> <span
id="vi.iii.iii.liv-Page_92"></span>they deny the resurrection of the
dead, and assert that God is not to be worshipped in Jerusalem, but on
Mount Gerizim.  They indeed rightly, from the predictions of Moses,
expect the one true Prophet; but by the wickedness of Dositheus they
were hindered from believing that Jesus is He whom they were expecting. 
The scribes also, and Pharisees, are led away into another schism; but
these, being baptized by John, and holding the word of truth received
from the tradition of Moses as the key of the kingdom of heaven, have
hid it from the hearing of the people. <span
id="fr_585"></span>[586](#fn_585)   Yea, some even of the disciples of
John, who seemed to be great ones, have separated themselves from the
people, and proclaimed their own master as the Christ.  But all these
schisms have been prepared, that by means of them the faith of Christ
and baptism might be hindered.”
