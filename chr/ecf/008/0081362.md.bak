<span id="vii.xxviii.i-p2"></span> ————————————

<span id="vii.xxviii.i-p3"></span><span class="c6"><span
id="vii.xxviii.i-p3.1"></span>Of the Journeyings of Philip the
Apostle.</span>

<span id="vii.xxviii.i-p4"></span><span class="c29"><span
id="vii.xxviii.i-p4.1"></span>From the Fifteenth Acts Until the End, and
Among Them the Martyrdom. <span id="fr_2157"></span>[2158](#fn_2157.md)
</span>

<span id="vii.xxviii.i-p6"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.xxviii.i-p6.1"></span>About</span> the time when the Emperor
Trajan received the government of the Romans, after Simon the son of
Clopas, who was bishop of Jerusalem, had suffered martyrdom in the
eighth year of his reign, being the second bishop of the church there
after James who bore the name of brother of the Lord, <span
id="fr_2158"></span>[2159](#fn_2158.md) Philip the apostle, going through
the cities and regions of Lydia and Asia, preached to all the Gospel of
Christ.

<span id="vii.xxviii.i-p8"></span>And having come to the city of
Ophioryma, which is called Hierapolis of Asia, he was entertained by a
certain believer, Stachys by name.  And there was with him also
Bartholomew, one of the seventy disciples of the Lord, and his sister
Mariamme, and his disciples that followed him.  All the men of the city
therefore, having left their work, ran to the house of Stachys, hearing
about the works which Philip did.  And many men and women having
assembled in the house of Stachys, Philip along with Bartholomew taught
them the things of Jesus.

<span id="vii.xxviii.i-p9"></span>And Philip’s sister Mariamme, sitting
in the entry of the house of Stachys, addressed herself to those coming,
persuading them to listen to the apostles, saying to them:  Our
brethren, and sons of my Father in heaven, ye are the excellent riches,
and the substance of the city above, the delight of the habitation which
God has prepared for those that love Him.  Trample under foot the snares
of the enemy, the writhing serpent.  For his path is crooked, since he
is the son of the wicked one, and the poison of wickedness is in him;
and his father is the devil, the author of death, and his mother
corruption; rage in his eyes and destruction in his mouth, and his path
is Hades.  Wherefore flee from him that has no substance, the shapeless
one that has no shape in all the creation, whether in the heaven or in
the earth, whether in the flying creatures or the beasts.  For
everything is taken away from his shape; for among the beasts of the
earth and the fowls of the heaven is the knowledge of him, that the
serpent trails his belly and his breast; and Tartarus is his
dwelling-place, and he goes in the darkness, since he has confidence in
nothing. <span id="fr_2159"></span>[2160](#fn_2159.md)   Flee therefore
from him, that his poison may not be poured out into your mouth.  But be
rather believing, holy, of good works, having no deceit.  Take away from
yourselves the wicked disposition, that is, the evil desires through
which the serpent, the wicked dragon, the prince of evil, has produced
the pasture of destruction and death for the soul, since all the desire
of the wicked has proceeded from him.  And this is the root of iniquity,
the maintenance of evils, the death of souls:  for the desire of the
enemy is armed against the believers, and comes forth from the darkness,
and walks in the darkness, taking in hand to war with those who are in
the light.  For this is the beginning of concupiscence. <span
id="fr_2160"></span>[2161](#fn_2160.md)   Wherefore you who wish to come to
us, and the rather that God has come through us to you as a father to
his own children, wishing to have mercy upon you, and to deliver you
from the wicked snare of the enemy, flee from the evil lusts of the
enemy, and cast them completely out of your mind, hating openly the
father of evils, and loving Jesus, who is light, and life, and truth,
and the Saviour of all who desire Him.  Having run, therefore, to Him,
take hold of Him in love, that He may bring you up out of the pit of the
wicked, and having cleansed you, set you blameless, living in truth, in
the presence of His Father.

<span id="vii.xxviii.i-p12"></span>And all these things Philip said to
the multitudes that had come together to worship as in old times the
serpents and the viper, of which also they set up images and worshipped
them.  Wherefore also they called Hierapolis Ophioryma. <span
id="fr_2161"></span>[2162](#fn_2161.md)   And these things having been said
by Philip, Bartholomew and Mariamme and his disciples, and Stachys being
along with him, all the people gave ear, and a great multitude of <span
id="page_498">p. 498</span> <span id="vii.xxviii.i-Page_498"></span>them
fleeing from the enemy were turned to Jesus, and were added to Philip
and those about him.  And the faithful were the more confirmed in the
love of Christ.

<span id="vii.xxviii.i-p14"></span>And Nicanora, the wife of the
proconsul, lying in bed under various diseases, especially of the eyes,
having heard about the Apostle Philip and his teaching, believed in the
Lord.  For she had even before this heard about Him; and having called
upon His name, she was released from the troubles that afflicted her. 
And rising up, she went forth out of her house through the side door,
carried by her own slaves in a silver litter, and went into the house of
Stachys, where the apostles were.

<span id="vii.xxviii.i-p15"></span>And when she came before the gate of
the house, Mariamme, the sister of Philip the apostle, seeing her, spoke
to her in the Hebrew tongue before Philip and Bartholomew, and all the
multitude of those who had believed, saying:  <span class="c9"><span
id="vii.xxviii.i-p15.1"></span>Alemakan, ikasame, marmare,
nachaman, <span id="fr_2162"></span>[2163](#fn_2162.md) mastranan,
achaman</span>; which is, Daughter of the father, thou art my mistress,
thou hast been given as a pledge to the serpent; but Jesus our Redeemer
has come to deliver thee through us, to break thy bands, and cut them,
and to remove them from thee from their root, because thou art my
sister, one mother brought us forth twins.  Thou hast forsaken thy
father, thou hast forsaken the path leading thee to the dwelling-place
of thy mother, being in error; thou hast left the temple of that
deception, and of the temporary glory, and hast come to us, fleeing from
the enemy, because he is the dwelling-place of death.  Behold, now thy
Redeemer has come to redeem thee; Christ the Sun of righteousness has
risen upon thee, to enlighten thee. <span
id="fr_2163"></span>[2164](#fn_2163.md)

<span id="vii.xxviii.i-p18"></span>And when Nicanora, standing before
the door, heard these things, she took courage before all, crying out,
and saying:  I am a Hebrew, and a daughter of the Hebrews; speak with me
in the language of my fathers.  For, having heard the preaching of my
fathers, I was straightway cured of the disease and the troubles that
encompassed me.  I therefore adore the goodness of God who has caused
you to be spoiled even to this city, on account of His true stone <span
id="fr_2164"></span>[2165](#fn_2164.md) held in honour, in order that
through you we may receive the knowledge of Him, and may live with you,
having believed in Him.

<span id="vii.xxviii.i-p20"></span>Nicanora having thus spoken, the
Apostle Philip, along with Bartholomew and Mariamme and those with them,
prayed for her to God, saying:  Thou who bringest the dead to life,
Christ Jesus the Lord, who hast freed us through baptism from the
slavery of death, <span id="fr_2165"></span>[2166](#fn_2165.md) completely
deliver also this woman from the error, the enemy; make her alive in Thy
life, and perfect her in Thy perfection, in order that she may be found
in the country of her fathers in freedom, having a portion in Thy
goodness, O Lord Jesus.

<span id="vii.xxviii.i-p22"></span>And all having sent up the amen along
with the Apostle Philip, behold, there came the tyrant, the husband of
Nicanora, raging like an unbroken horse; and having laid hold of his
wife’s garments, he cried out, saying:  O Nicanora, did not I leave thee
in bed? how hadst thou so much strength as to come to these magicians? 
And how hast thou been cured of the inflammation of thine eyes?  Now,
therefore, unless thou tell me who thy physician is, and what is his
name, I shall punish thee with various punishments, and shall not have
compassion upon thee.  And she answering, says to him:  O tyrant, cast
out from thee this tyranny of thine, forsake this wickedness of thine;
abandon this life lasting only for a season; run away from the brutality
of thy worthless disposition; flee from the wicked dragon and his lusts;
throw from thee the works and the dart of the man-slaying serpent;
renounce the abominable and wicked sacrifices of the idols, which are
the husbandry of the enemy, the hedge of darkness; make for thyself a
life chaste and pure, that being in holiness thou mayst be able to know
my Physician, and to get His name.  If therefore thou wishest me to be
beside thee, prepare thyself to live in chastity and self-restraint, and
in fear of the true God, and I shall live with thee all my life; only
cleanse thyself from the idols, and from all their filth.

<span id="vii.xxviii.i-p23"></span>And when the gloomy tyrant her
husband heard these words of hers, he seized her by the hair of her
head, and dragged her along, kicking her, and saying:  It will be a fine
thing for thee to be cut off by the sword, or to see thee from beside me
committing fornication with these foreign magicians; for I see that thou
hast fallen into the madness of these deceivers.  Thee first of them,
therefore, I shall cut off by an evil death; and then, not sparing them,
I shall cut their sinews, and put them to a most cruel death.  And
having turned, he said to those about him:  Bring out for me those
impostors of magicians.  And the public executioners having run into the
house of Stachys, and laid hold of the Apostle Philip, and Bartholomew
and Mariamme, dragged them along, leading them to where the proconsul
was.  And the most faithful Stachys followed, and all the faithful.

<span id="vii.xxviii.i-p24"></span>And the proconsul seeing them,
gnashed his teeth, saying:  Torture these deceivers that have deceived
many women, and young men and girls, saying that they are worshippers of
God, while they are an abomination.  And he ordered thongs of raw hide
to be brought, and Philip <span id="page_499">p. 499</span> <span
id="vii.xxviii.i-Page_499"></span>and Bartholomew and Mariamme to be
beaten; and after they had been scourged with the thongs, he ordered
their feet to be tied, and them to be dragged through the streets of the
city as far as the gate of their temple.  And a great crowd was
assembled, so that scarcely any one stayed at home; and they all
wondered at their patience, as they were being violently and inhumanly
dragged along.

<span id="vii.xxviii.i-p25"></span>And the proconsul, having tortured
the Apostle Philip and the saints who were with him, ordered them to be
brought, and secured in the temple of the idol of the viper by its
priests, until he should decide by what death he should destroy each of
them.  And many of the crowd believed in the grace of Christ, and were
added to the Apostle Philip, and those with him, having renounced the
idol of the viper, and were confirmed in the faith, being magnified by
the endurance of the saints; and all together with their voice glorified
God, saying the amen.

<span id="vii.xxviii.i-p26"></span>And when they were shut up in the
temple of the viper—both Philip the Apostle, and Bartholomew and
Mariamme—the priests of the viper assembled in the same place, and a
great crowd, about seven thousand men; and having run to the proconsul,
they cried out, saying:  Avenge us of the foreigners, and magicians, and
corrupters and seducers of men.  For ever since they came to us, our
city has been filled with every evil deed; and they have also killed the
serpents, the sons of our goddess; and they have also shut the temple,
and the altar has been desolated; and we have not found the wine which
had been brought in order that the viper, having drunk of it, might go
to sleep.  But if thou wishest to know that they are really magicians,
look and see how they wish to bewitch us, saying, Live in chastity and
piety, after believing in God; and how also they have come into the
city; and how also the dragons have not struck them blind, or even
killed them; and how also they have not drunk their blood; but even they
who keep our city from every foreigner have been cast down by these men.

<span id="vii.xxviii.i-p27"></span>And the proconsul, having heard these
things, was the more inflamed with rage, and filled with wrath and
threatening; and he was exceedingly enraged, and said to the priests: 
Why *need you speak*, when they have bewitched my own wife?  And from
that time she has spoken to me with strange words; and praying all the
night through, she speaks in a strange tongue with a light shining round
her; and groaning aloud, she says, Jesus the true light has come to me. 
And I, having gone forth from my chamber, wished to look down through
the window and see Jesus, the light which she spoke of; and like
lightning it came upon me, so that I was within a little of being
blinded; and from that time forth I am afraid of my wife, on account of
her luminous Jesus.  Tell me, ye priests, what I am to do.  And they
said to him:  O proconsul, assuredly we are no longer priests; for ever
since thou didst shut them up, in consequence of them praying, not only
has the temple been shaken from the foundations, but it is also
assuredly falling down.

<span id="vii.xxviii.i-p28"></span>Then the proconsul ordered to bring
Philip and those with him forth out of the temple, and to bring them up
to the tribunal, saying to the public executioner:  Strip Philip and
Bartholomew and Mariamme, and search thoroughly to try to find their
enchantments.  Having therefore first stripped Philip, then Bartholomew,
they came also to Mariamme; and dragging her along, they said:  Let us
strip her naked, that all may see her, how she follows men; for she
especially deceives all the women.  And the tyrant says to the priests: 
Proclaim throughout the whole city round about that all should come, men
and women, that they may see her indecency, that she travels about with
these magicians, and no doubt commits adultery with them.  And he
ordered Philip to be hanged, and his ankles to be pierced, and to bring
also iron hooks, and his heels also to be driven through, and to be
hanged head downwards, opposite the temple on a certain tree; and
stretch out Bartholomew opposite Philip, having nailed his hands on the
wall of the gate of the temple.

<span id="vii.xxviii.i-p29"></span>And both of them smiled, seeing each
other, both Philip and Bartholomew; for they were as if they were not
tortured:  for their punishments were prizes and crowns.  And when also
they had stripped Mariamme, behold, straightway the semblance of her
body was changed in the presence of all, and straightway there was about
her a cloud of fire before all; and they could not longer look at all on
the place in which the holy Mariamme was, but they all fled from her.

<span id="vii.xxviii.i-p30"></span>And Philip spoke with Bartholomew in
the Hebrew tongue saying:  Where is our brother John? for, behold, I am
being released from the body; and who is he that has prayed for us? 
Because they have also laid hands on our sister Mariamme, contrary to
what is meet; and, behold, they have set fire to the house of Stachys,
saying, Let us burn it, since he entertained them.  Dost thou wish then,
Bartholomew, fire to come from heaven, and that we should burn them up?

<span id="vii.xxviii.i-p31"></span>And as Philip was thus speaking,
behold, also John entered into the city like one of their
fellow-citizens; and moving about in the street, he asked:  Who are
these men, and why are they punished?  And they say to him:  It cannot
be that thou art of our city, and askest about these men, who have
wronged many:  for they have shut up our gods, and by their magic <span
id="page_500">p. 500</span> <span id="vii.xxviii.i-Page_500"></span>have
cut off both the serpents and the dragons; and they have also raised
many of the dead, who have struck us with amazement, detailing many
punishments *against us*, and they wish also, these strangers who are
hanging, to pray for fire out of heaven, and to burn up us and our city.

<span id="vii.xxviii.i-p32"></span>Then says John:  Let us go, and do
you show me them.  They led John, therefore, as their fellow-citizen, to
where Philip was; and there was there a great crowd, and the proconsul,
and the priests.  And Philip, seeing John, said to Bartholomew in
Hebrew:  Brother, John has come, who was in Barek, where the living
water is. <span id="fr_2166"></span>[2167](#fn_2166.md)   And John saw
Philip hanging head downwards both by the ankles and the heels; <span
id="fr_2167"></span>[2168](#fn_2167.md) and he also saw Bartholomew
stretched out on the wall of the temple; and he said to them:  The
mystery of him that was hanged between the heaven and the earth shall be
with you.

<span id="vii.xxviii.i-p35"></span>And he said also to the men of that
city:  Ye men who dwell in Ophioryma Hierapolis, great is the ignorance
which is among you, for you have erred in the path of error.  The dragon
breathing has breathed upon you, and blinded you in three ways; that is,
he has made you blind in body, and blind in soul, and blind in spirit: 
and you have been struck by the destroyer.  Look upon the whole
creation, whether in the earth, or in the heaven, or in the waters, that
the serpent has no resemblance to anything above; <span
id="fr_2168"></span>[2169](#fn_2168.md) but he is of the stock of
corruption, and has been brought to nothing by God; and on this account
he is twisted and crooked, and there is no life in him; and anger, and
rage, and darkness, and fire, and smoke are in all his members.  And
now, therefore, why do you punish these men because they have told you
that the serpent is your enemy?

<span id="vii.xxviii.i-p37"></span>And when they heard these words from
John, they raised their hands against him, saying:  We thought thee to
be a fellow-citizen, but now thou hast shown thyself that thou art their
companion.  Like them, so also thou shalt be put to death; for the
priests have intended to squeeze out your blood, and having mixed it
with wine, to bring it to the viper to drink it.  When, therefore, the
priests attempted to lay hold of John, their hands were paralyzed.  And
John said to Philip:  Let us not at all render evil for evil.  And
Philip said to John:  Behold now, where is my Lord Jesus, who told me
not to avenge myself?  But for my part, I shall not endure it longer;
but I will accomplish upon them my threat, and will destroy them
all <span id="fr_2169"></span>[2170](#fn_2169.md) .

<span id="vii.xxviii.i-p39"></span>And John and Bartholomew and Mariamme
restrained him, saying:  Our Master was beaten, was scourged, was
extended *on the cross*, was made to drink gall and vinegar, and said,
Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do. <span
id="fr_2170"></span>[2171](#fn_2170.md)   And this He taught, saying: 
Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart. <span
id="fr_2171"></span>[2172](#fn_2171.md)   Let us also therefore be
patient.  Philip says:  Go away, and do not mollify me; for I will not
bear that they have hanged me head down, and pierced my ankles and my
heels with irons.  And thou, John, beloved of God, how much hast thou
reasoned with them, and thou hast not been listened to!  Wherefore go
away from me, and I will curse them, and they shall be destroyed utterly
to a man.  And he began to curse them, invoking, and crying out in
Hebrew:  <span class="c9"><span id="vii.xxviii.i-p41.2"></span>Abalo,
aremun, iduthael, tharseleon, nachoth, aidunaph, teletoloi</span>: <span
id="fr_2172"></span>[2173](#fn_2172.md)   that is, O Father of Christ, the
only and Almighty God; O God, whom all ages dread, powerful and
impartial Judge, whose name is in Thy dynasty Sabaoth, <span
id="fr_2173"></span>[2174](#fn_2173.md) blessed art Thou for everlasting: 
before Thee tremble dominions and powers of the celestials, and the
fire-breathing threats of the cherubic living ones; the King, holy in
majesty, whose name came upon the wild beasts of the desert, and they
were tamed, and praised Thee with a rational voice; who lookest upon us,
and readily grantest our requests; who knewest us before we were
fashioned; the Overseer of all:  now, I pray, let the great Hades open
its mouth; let the great abyss swallow up these the ungodly, who have
not been willing to receive the word of truth in this city.  So let it
be, Sabaoth.  And, behold, suddenly the abyss was opened, and the whole
of the place in which the proconsul was sitting was swallowed up, and
the whole of the temple, and the viper which they worshipped, and great
crowds, and the priests of the viper, about seven thousand men, besides
women and children, except where the apostles were:  they remained
unshaken.  And the proconsul was swallowed up into the abyss; and their
voices came up from beneath, saying, with weeping:  Have mercy upon us,
O God of Thy glorious apostles, because we now see the judgments of
those who have not confessed the crucified One:  behold, the cross
illumines us.  O Jesus Christ, manifest Thyself to us, because we are
all coming down alive into Hades, and are being scourged because we have
unjustly crucified Thine apostles.  And a voice was heard of one,
saying:  I shall be merciful to you in the cross of light.

<span id="vii.xxviii.i-p44"></span>And there remained both Stachys and
all his house, and the wife of the proconsul, and fifty other women who
had believed with her upon <span id="page_501">p. 501</span> <span
id="vii.xxviii.i-Page_501"></span>the Lord, and a multitude besides,
both of men and women, and a hundred virgins who had not been swallowed
up because of their chastity, having been sealed with the seal of
Christ.

<span id="vii.xxviii.i-p45"></span>Then the Lord, having appeared unto
Philip, said:  O Philip, didst thou not hear:  Thou shalt not render
evil for evil? and why hast thou inflicted such destruction?  O Philip,
whosoever putteth his hand to the plough, and looketh backwards, <span
id="fr_2174"></span>[2175](#fn_2174.md) is his furrow well set? or who
gives up his own lamp to another, and himself sits in darkness? or who
forsakes his own dwelling-place, and dwells on a dunghill himself?  And
who, giving away his own garment in winter, goes naked? or what enemy
rejoices in the joy of the man that hates him? and what soldier goes to
war without a full suit of armour? and what slave who has fulfilled his
master’s order will not be commended? and who in the race-course, having
nobly run, does not receive the prize? and who that has washed his
garments willingly defiles them?  Behold, my bride chamber is ready; but
blessed is he who has been found in it wearing the shining
garment: <span id="fr_2175"></span>[2176](#fn_2175.md)   he it is who
receives the crown upon his head.  Behold, the supper is ready; and
blessed is he who is invited, and is ready to go to Him that has invited
him.  The harvest of the field is much, <span
id="fr_2176"></span>[2177](#fn_2176.md) and blessed is the good labourer. 
Behold the lilies and all the flowers, and it is the good husbandman who
is the first to get a share of them.  And how hast thou become, O
Philip, unmerciful, having cursed thine enemies in wrath?

<span id="vii.xxviii.i-p49"></span>Philip says:  Why art Thou angry with
me, Lord, because I have cursed mine enemies? for why dost Thou not
tread them under foot, because they are yet alive in the abyss?  And
knowest Thou, Lord, that because of Thee I came into this city, and in
Thy name I have persecuted all the error of the idols, and all the
demons?  The dragons have withered away, and the serpents.  And since
these men have not received Thy light, therefore have I cursed them, and
they have gone down to Hades alive.

<span id="vii.xxviii.i-p50"></span>And the Saviour says to Philip:  But
since thou hast disobeyed me, and hast requited evil for evil, and hast
not kept my commandment, on this account thou shalt finish thy course
gloriously indeed, and shalt be led by the hand by my holy angels, and
shalt come with them even to the paradise of delight; and they indeed
shall come beside me into paradise, but thee will I order to be shut
outside of paradise for forty days, in terror under the flaming and
turning sword, and thou shalt groan because thou hast done evil to those
who have done evil to thee.  And after forty days I shall send my
archangel Michael; and he, having taken hold of the sword guarding
paradise, shall bring thee into it, and thou shalt see all the righteous
who have walked in their innocence, and then thou shalt worship the
glory of my Father in the heavens.  Nevertheless the sign of thy
departure shall be glorified in my cross.  And Bartholomew having gone
away into Lycaonia, shall there also be himself crucified; and Mariamme
shall lay her body in the river Jordan.  But I, O Philip, will not
endure thee, because thou hast swallowed up the men into the abyss; but,
behold, my Spirit is in them, and I shall bring them up from the dead;
and thus they, seeing thee, shall believe in the glory of Him that sent
thee.

<span id="vii.xxviii.i-p51"></span>And the Saviour having turned,
stretched up His hand, and marked a cross in the air coming down from
above even to the abyss, and it was full of light, and had its form
after the likeness of a ladder.  And all the multitude that had gone
down from the city into the abyss came up on the ladder of the luminous
cross; but there remained below the proconsul, and the viper which they
worshipped.  And when the multitude had come up, having looked upon
Philip hanging head downwards, they lamented with a great lamentation at
the lawless action which they had done.  And they also saw Bartholomew,
and Mariamme having her former appearance.  And, behold, the Lord went
up into the heavens in the sight of Philip, and Bartholomew and
Mariamme, and Stachys, and all the unbelieving people, and silently they
glorified God in fear and trembling.  And all the multitudes cried out,
saying:  He alone is God, whom these men proclaim in truth; He alone is
God, who sent these men for our salvation.  Let us therefore truly
repent for our great error, because we are by no means worthy of
everlasting life.  Now we believe, because we have seen great wonders,
because the Saviour has brought us up from the abyss.  And they all fell
upon their face, and adored Philip, and entreated him, ready to flee: 
Do not do another miracle, and again send us away into the abyss.  And
they prayed that they might become worthy of the appearing of Christ.

<span id="vii.xxviii.i-p52"></span>And Philip, yet hanging, addressed
them, and said:  Hear and learn how great are the powers of my God,
remembering what you have seen below, and how your city has been
overturned, with the exception of the house which received me; and now
the sweetness of my God has brought you up out of the abyss, and I am
obliged to walk round paradise for forty days on your account, because I
was enraged against you into requiting you.  And this commandment alone
I have not kept, in that I did not give you good in return for evil. 
But I say unto you, From this time forth, in the goodness of God,
re<span id="page_502">p. 502</span> <span
id="vii.xxviii.i-Page_502"></span>ject the evil, that you may become
worthy of the thanksgiving <span id="fr_2177"></span>[2178](#fn_2177.md) of
the Lord.

<span id="vii.xxviii.i-p54"></span>And some of the faithful ran up to
take down Philip, and take off him the iron grapnels, and the hooks out
of his ankles.  But Philip said:  Do not, my children, do not come near
me on account of this, for thus shall be my end.  Listen to me, ye who
have been enlightened in the Lord, that I came to this city, not to make
any merchandise, or do any other thing; but I have been destined to go
out of my body in this city in the case in which you see me.  Grieve
not, then, that I am hanging thus; for I bear the stamp <span
id="fr_2178"></span>[2179](#fn_2178.md) of the first man, who was brought
to the earth head downwards, and again, through the wood of the cross
brought to life out of the death of the transgression.  And now I
accomplish that which hath been enjoined upon me; for the Lord said to
me, Unless you shall make that of you which is down to be up, and that
which is on the left to be on the right, you shall not enter into my
kingdom.  Be ye not therefore likened to the unchanged type, for all the
world has been changed, and every soul dwelling in a body is in
forgetfulness of heavenly things; but let not us possessing the glory of
the heavenly seek that which is without, which is the body and the house
of slavery.  Be not unbelieving, but believing, and forgive each other’s
faults.  Behold, I hang six days, and I have blame from the true Judge,
because I altogether requited you evil, and put a stumbling-block in the
way of my rectitude.  And now I am going up on high; be not sorrowful,
but rather rejoice, because I am leaving this dwelling-place, my body,
having escaped from the corruption of the dragon, who punishes every
soul that is in sins.

<span id="vii.xxviii.i-p56"></span>And Philip, having looked round upon
the multitudes, said:  O ye who have come up out of the dead from Hades,
and the swallowing up of the abyss,—and the luminous cross led you up on
high, through the goodness of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy
Ghost,—He being God became man, having been made flesh out of the Virgin
Mary, immortal, abiding in flesh; and having died, He raised the dead,
having had pity on mankind, having taken away the sting of sin.  He was
great, and became small for our sake, until He should enlarge the small,
and bring them into His greatness.  And He it is who has sweetness; and
they spat upon Him, giving Him gall to drink, in order that He might
make those who were bitter against Him to taste of His sweetness. 
Cleave then to Him, and do not forsake Him, for He is our life to
everlasting.

<span id="vii.xxviii.i-p57"></span>And when Philip had finished this
announcement, he says to them, Loose Bartholomew; and having gone up,
they loosed him.  And after loosing him, Philip says to him:
 Bartholomew, my brother in the Lord, thou knowest that the Lord has
sent thee with me to this city, and thou hast shared with me in all the
dangers with our sister Mariamme; but I know that the going forth from
thy body has been appointed in Lycaonia, and it has been decreed to
Mariamme to go forth from the body in the river Jordan.  Now therefore I
command you, that when I have gone forth from my body, you shall build a
church in this place; and let the leopard and the kid of the goats <span
id="fr_2179"></span>[2180](#fn_2179.md) come into the church, for a sign to
those that believe; and let Nicanora provide for them until they shall
go forth from the body; and when they shall have gone forth, bury them
by the gate of the church.  And lay your peace upon the house of
Stachys, as Christ laid His peace on this city.  And let all the virgins
who believe stand in that house each day, watching over the sick,
walking two and two; but let them have no communication with young men,
that Satan may not tempt them: <span
id="fr_2180"></span>[2181](#fn_2180.md)   for he is a creeping serpent, and
he caused Adam by means of Eve to slip into death.  Let it not be so
again in this time as in the case of Eve.  But do thou, O Bartholomew,
look to them well: <span id="fr_2181"></span>[2182](#fn_2181.md)   and thou
shalt give these injunctions to Stachys, and appoint him bishop.  Do not
entrust the place of the bishopric to a young man, that the Gospel of
Christ may not be brought to shame; and let every one that teacheth have
his works equal to his words.  But I am going to the Lord, and take my
body and prepare it for burial with Syriac sheets of paper; and do not
put round me flaxen cloth, because the body of my Lord was wrapped in
linen.  And having prepared my body for burial in the sheets of paper,
bind it tight with papyrus reeds, and bury it in the church; and pray
for me <span id="fr_2182"></span>[2183](#fn_2182.md) forty days, in order
that the Lord may forgive me the transgression wherein I transgressed,
in requiting those who did evil to me.  See, O Bartholomew, where my
blood shall drop upon the earth, a plant shall spring up from my blood,
and shall become a vine, and shall produce fruit of a bunch of grapes;
and having taken the cluster, press it into the cup; and having partaken
of it on the third day, send up on high the Amen, in order that the
offering may be complete.

<span id="vii.xxviii.i-p62"></span>And Philip, having said these things,
prayed thus:  O Lord Jesus Christ, Father of the ages, King of the
light, who hast made us wise in Thy wisdom, and hast given us Thine
understanding, and hast bestowed upon us the counsel of Thy <span
id="page_503">p. 503</span> <span
id="vii.xxviii.i-Page_503"></span>goodness, who hast never at any time
left us, Thou art He who taketh away the disease of those who flee to
Thee for refuge; Thou art the Son of the living God, who hast given us
Thy presence of wisdom, who hast given us signs and wonders, and hast
turned those who have gone astray; who crownest those who overcome the
adversary, Thou excellent Judge. <span
id="fr_2183"></span>[2184](#fn_2183.md)   Come now, Jesus, and give me the
everlasting crown of victory against every adverse dominion and power,
and do not let their dark air hide me when I shall cross the waters of
fire and all the abyss.  O my Lord Jesus Christ, let not the enemy have
ground to accuse me at Thy tribunal:  but put on me Thy glorious robe,
Thy seal of light that ever shines, until I shall pass by all the powers
of the world, and the wicked dragon that lieth in wait for us.  Now
therefore, my Lord Jesus Christ, make me to meet Thee in the air, having
forgiven me the recompense which I recompensed to my enemies; and
transform the form of my body into angelic glory, and give me rest in
Thy blessedness; and let me receive the promise from Thee which Thou
hast promised to Thy saints to everlasting.

<span id="vii.xxviii.i-p64"></span>And having thus spoken, Philip gave
up the ghost, while all the multitudes were looking upon him, and
weeping, and saying:  The life of this spirit has been accomplished in
peace.  And they said the Amen.

<span id="vii.xxviii.i-p65"></span>And Bartholomew and Mariamme took
down his body, and did as Philip had commanded them, and buried it in
that place.  And there was straightway a voice out of the heavens: 
Philip the apostle has been crowned with an incorruptible crown by Jesus
Christ, the Judge of the contest.  And all shouted out the Amen.

<span id="vii.xxviii.i-p66"></span>And after the three days the plant of
the vine sprouted up where the blood of the holy Philip had dropped. 
And they did all that had been commanded them by him, offering an
offering for forty days, praying without ceasing.  And they built the
church in that place, having appointed Stachys bishop in the church. 
And Nicanora and all the faithful assembled, and did not cease, all of
them, glorifying God on account of the wonders that had happened among
them.  And all the city believed in the name of Jesus.  And Bartholomew
commanded Stachys to baptize those who believed into the name of the
Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost.

<span id="vii.xxviii.i-p67"></span>And after the forty days, the
Saviour, having appeared in the form of Philip, said to Bartholomew and
Mariamme:  My beloved brethren, do you wish to rest in the rest of God? 
Paradise has been opened to me, and I have entered into the glory of
Jesus.  Go away to the place appointed for you; for the plant that has
been set apart and planted in this city shall bear excellent fruit. 
Having therefore saluted the brethren, and prayed for each of them, they
departed from the city of Ophioryma, the Hierapolis of Asia; and
Bartholomew departed into Lycaonia, and Mariamme proceeded to the
Jordan; and Stachys and those with him remained, maintaining the church
in Christ Jesus our Lord, to whom be glory and strength for ever and
ever.  Amen.
