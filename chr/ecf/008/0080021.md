id="fr_196"></span>[197](#fn_196.md) </span>

<span id="iv.iii-p6"></span> ————————————

<span id="iv.iii-p7"></span>I.  <span class="c9"><span
id="iv.iii-p7.1"></span>Those</span> around Sedrach, Misak, and Abednago
in the furnace of fire say as they praise God, “Bless, ye heavens, the
Lord; praise and exalt Him for ever;” then, “Bless, ye angels, the
Lord;” then, “Bless the Lord, all ye waters that are above heaven.”  So
the Scriptures assign the heavens and the waters to the class of pure
powers <span id="fr_197"></span>[198](#fn_197.md) as is shown in Genesis. 
Suitably, then, inasmuch as “power” is used with a variety of meaning,
Daniel adds, “Let every power bless the Lord;” then, further, “Bless the
Lord, sun and moon;” and, “Bless the Lord, ye stars of heaven.  Bless
the Lord, all ye that worship *Him;* praise and confess the God of gods,
for His mercy is for ever.”  It is written in Daniel, on the occasion of
the three children praising in the furnace.

<span id="iv.iii-p9"></span>II.  “Blessed art Thou, who lookest on the
abysses as Thou sittest on the cherubim,” says Daniel, in agreement with
Enoch, <span id="fr_198"></span>[199](#fn_198.md) who said, “And I saw all
sorts of matter.”  For the abyss, which is in its essence boundless, is
bounded by the power of God.  These material essences then, from which
the separate genera and their species are produced, are called abysses;
since you would not call the water alone the abyss, although matter is
allegorically called water, the abyss.

<span id="iv.iii-p11"></span>III.  “In the beginning God made the heaven
and the earth,” <span id="fr_199"></span>[200](#fn_199.md) both terrestrial
and celestial things.  And that this is true, the Lord said to Osee,
“Go, take to thyself a wife of fornication, and children of
fornication:  because the land committing fornication, shall commit
fornication, *departing* from the Lord.” <span
id="fr_200"></span>[201](#fn_200.md)   For it is not the element *of earth*
that he speaks of, but those that dwell in the element, those who have
an earthly disposition.

<span id="iv.iii-p14"></span>IV.  And that the Son is the
beginning <span id="fr_201"></span>[202](#fn_201.md) *or head*, Hosea
teaches clearly:  “And it shall be, that in the place in which it was
said to them, Ye are not my people, they shall be called the children of
the living God:  and the children of Judah and the children of Israel
shall be gathered to the same place, and they shall place over them one
head, <span id="fr_202"></span>[203](#fn_202.md) and they shall come up out
of the land; for great is the day of Jezreel.” <span
id="fr_203"></span>[204](#fn_203.md)   For whom one believes, him He
chooses.  But one believes the Son, who is the head; wherefore also he
said in addition:  “But I will have mercy on the sons of Judah, and will
save them by the Lord their God.” <span
id="fr_204"></span>[205](#fn_204.md)   Now the Saviour who saves is the Son
of God.  He is then the head. <span id="fr_205"></span>[206](#fn_205.md)

<span id="iv.iii-p20"></span>V.  The Spirit by Osee says, “I am your
Instructor;” <span id="fr_206"></span>[207](#fn_206.md) “Blow ye <span
id="fr_207"></span>[208](#fn_207.md) the trumpet upon the hills of the
Lord; sound upon the high places.” <span
id="fr_208"></span>[209](#fn_208.md)   And is not baptism itself, which is
the sign of regeneration, an escape from matter, by the teaching of the
Saviour, a great impetuous stream, ever rushing on and bearing us
along?  The Lord accordingly, leading us out of disorder, illumines us
by bringing us into the light, which is shadowless and is material no
longer.

<span id="iv.iii-p24"></span>VI.  This river and sea of matter two
prophets <span id="fr_209"></span>[210](#fn_209.md) cut asunder and divided
by the power of the Lord, the matter being bounded, through both
divisions of the water.  Famous leaders both, by whom the signs were
believed, they complied with the will of God, so that the righteous man
may proceed from matter, having journeyed through it first.  On the one
of these commanders also was imposed the name of our Saviour. <span
id="fr_210"></span>[211](#fn_210.md)

<span id="iv.iii-p27"></span><span id="page_44">p. 44</span> <span
id="iv.iii-Page_44"></span>VII.  Now, regeneration is by water and
spirit, as was all creation:  “For the Spirit of God moved on the
abyss.” <span id="fr_211"></span>[212](#fn_211.md)   And for this reason
the Saviour was baptized, though not Himself needing <span
id="fr_212"></span>[213](#fn_212.md) to be so, in order that He might
consecrate the whole water for those who were being regenerated.  Thus
it is not the body only, but the soul, that we cleanse.  It is
accordingly a sign of the sanctifying of our invisible part, and of the
straining off from the new and spiritual creation of the unclean spirits
that have got mixed up with the soul.

<span id="iv.iii-p30"></span>VIII.  “The water above the heaven.”  Since
baptism is performed by water and the Spirit as a protection against the
twofold fire,—that which lays hold of what is visible, and that which
lays hold of what is invisible; and of necessity, there being an
immaterial element of water and a material, is it a protection against
the twofold <span id="fr_213"></span>[214](#fn_213.md) fire.  And the
earthly water cleanses the body; but the heavenly water, by reason of
its being immaterial and invisible, is an emblem of the Holy Spirit, who
is the purifier of what is invisible, as the water of the Spirit, as the
other of the body.

<span id="iv.iii-p32"></span>IX.  God, out of goodness, hath mingled
fear with goodness.  For what is beneficial for each one, that He also
supplies, as a physician to a sick man, as a father to his insubordinate
child:  “For he that spareth his rod hateth his son.” <span
id="fr_214"></span>[215](#fn_214.md)   And the Lord and His apostles walked
in the midst of fear and labours.  When, then, the affliction is sent in
the person of a righteous man, <span id="fr_215"></span>[216](#fn_215.md)
it is either from the Lord rebuking him for a sin committed before, or
guarding him on account of the future, or not preventing by the exercise
of His power an assault from without, <span
id="fr_216"></span>[217](#fn_216.md) —for some good end to him and to those
near, for the sake of example.

<span id="iv.iii-p36"></span>X.  Now those that dwell in a corrupt body,
like those who sail in an old ship, do not lie on their back, but are
ever praying, stretching their hands to God.

<span id="iv.iii-p37"></span>XI.  The ancients were exceedingly
distressed, unless they had always some suffering in the body.  For they
were afraid, that if they received not in this world the punishment of
the sins which, in numbers through ignorance, accompany those that are
in the flesh, they would in the other world suffer the penalty all at
once.  So that they preferred curative treatment here.  What is to be
dreaded is, then, not external disease, but sins, for which disease
*comes*, and disease of the soul, not of the body:  “For all flesh is
grass,” <span id="fr_217"></span>[218](#fn_217.md) and corporeal and
external good things are temporary; “but the things which are unseen are
eternal.” <span id="fr_218"></span>[219](#fn_218.md)

<span id="iv.iii-p40"></span>XII.  As to knowledge, some elements of it
we already possess; others, by what we do possess, we firmly hope *to
attain*.  For neither have we attained all, nor do we lack all.  But we
have received, as it were, an earnest of the eternal blessings, and of
the ancestral riches.  The provisions for the Lord’s way are the Lord’s
beatitudes.  For He said:  “Seek,” and anxiously seek, “the kingdom of
God, and all these things shall be added to you:  for the Father knoweth
what things ye have need of.” <span id="fr_219"></span>[220](#fn_219.md)  
Thus He limits not only our occupations, but our cares.  For He says: 
“Ye cannot, by taking thought, add aught to your stature.” <span
id="fr_220"></span>[221](#fn_220.md)   For God knows well what it is good
for us to have and what to want.  He wishes, therefore, that we,
emptying ourselves of worldly cares, should be filled with that which is
directed towards God.  “For we groan, desiring to be clothed upon with
that which is incorruptible, before putting off corruption.”  For when
faith is shed abroad, unbelief is nonplussed.  Similarly also with
knowledge and righteousness.  We must therefore not only empty the soul,
but fill it with God.  For no longer is there evil in it, since that has
been made to cease; nor yet is there good, since it has not yet received
good.  But what is neither good nor evil is nothing.  “For to the swept
and empty house return,” <span id="fr_221"></span>[222](#fn_221.md) if none
of the blessings of salvation has been put in, the unclean spirit that
dwelt there before, taking with him seven other unclean spirits. 
Wherefore, after emptying the soul of what is evil, we must fill with
the good God that which is His chosen dwelling-place.  For when the
empty rooms are filled, then follows the seal, that the sanctuary may be
guarded for God.

<span id="iv.iii-p44"></span>XIII.  “By two and three witnesses every
word is established.” <span id="fr_222"></span>[223](#fn_222.md)   By
Father, and Son, and Holy Spirit, by whose witness and help the
prescribed commandments ought to be kept. <span
id="fr_223"></span>[224](#fn_223.md)

<span id="iv.iii-p47"></span>XIV.  Fasting, according to the
signification of the word, is abstinence from food.  Now food makes us
neither more righteous nor less.  But mystically it shows that, as life
is maintained in individuals by sustenance, and want of sustenance is
the token of death; so also ought we to fast from worldly things, that
we may die to the world, and after that, by partaking of divine
sustenance, live to God.  Especially does fasting <span id="page_45">p.
45</span> <span id="iv.iii-Page_45"></span>empty the soul of matter, and
make it, along with the body, pure and light for the divine words. 
Worldly food is, then, the former life and sins; but the divine food is
faith, hope, love, patience, knowledge, peace, temperance.  For “blessed
are they that hunger and thirst after” God’s “righteousness; for they
shall be filled.” <span id="fr_224"></span>[225](#fn_224.md)   The soul,
but not the body, it is which is susceptible of this craving.

<span id="iv.iii-p49"></span>XV.  The Saviour showed to the believing
apostles prayer to be stronger than faith in the case of a demoniac,
whom they could not cleanse, when He said, Such things are accomplished
by prayer.  He who has believed has obtained forgiveness of sins from
the Lord; but he who has attained knowledge, inasmuch as he no longer
sins, obtains from himself the forgiveness of the rest.

<span id="iv.iii-p50"></span>XVI.  For as cures, and prophecies, and
signs are performed by the agency of men, God working in them, so also
is Gnostic teaching.  For God shows His power through men.  And the
prophecy rightly says, “I will send to them a man who will save
them.” <span id="fr_225"></span>[226](#fn_225.md)   Accordingly He sends
forth at one time prophets, at another apostles, to be saviours of men. 
Thus God does good by the agency of men.  For it is not that God can do
some things, and cannot do others:  He is never powerless in anything. 
No more are some things done with, and some things against His will; and
some things by Him, and some things by another.  But He even brought us
into being by means of men, and trained us by means of men.

<span id="iv.iii-p52"></span>XVII.  God made us, having previously no
existence.  For if we had a previous existence, we must have known where
we were, and how and why we came hither.  But if we had no
pre-existence, then God is the sole author of our creation.  As, then,
He made us who had no existence; so also, now that we are made, He saves
us by His own grace, if we show ourselves worthy and susceptible; if
not, He <span id="fr_226"></span>[227](#fn_226.md) will let us pass to our
proper end.  For He is Lord both of the living and the dead.

<span id="iv.iii-p54"></span>XVIII.  But see the power of God, not only
in the case of men, in bringing to existence out of non-existence, and
making them when brought into being grow up according to the progress of
the time of life, but also in saving those who believe, in a way
suitable to each individual.  And now He changes both hours, and times,
and fruits, and elements.  For this is the one God, who has measured
both the beginning and the end of events suitably to each one.

<span id="iv.iii-p55"></span>XIX.  Advancing from faith and fear to
knowledge, man knows how to say Lord, Lord; but not as His slave, he has
learned to say, Our Father. <span id="fr_227"></span>[228](#fn_227.md)  
Having set free the spirit of bondage, which produces fear, and advanced
by love to adoption, he now reverences from love Him whom he feared
before.  For he no longer abstains from what he ought to abstain from
out of fear, but out of love clings to the commandments.  “The Spirit
itself,” it is said, “beareth witness when we cry, Abba, <span
id="fr_228"></span>[229](#fn_228.md) Father.” <span
id="fr_229"></span>[230](#fn_229.md)

<span id="iv.iii-p59"></span>XX.  Now the Lord with His precious blood
redeems us, freeing us from our old bitter masters, that is, our sins,
on account of which the spiritual *powers* of wickedness ruled over us.
 Accordingly He leads us into the liberty of the Father,—sons that are
co-heirs and friends.  “For,” says the Lord, “they that do the will of
my Father are my brethren and fellow-heirs.” <span
id="fr_230"></span>[231](#fn_230.md)   “Call no man, therefore, father to
yourselves on earth.” <span id="fr_231"></span>[232](#fn_231.md)   For it
is masters that are on earth.  But in heaven is the Father, of whom is
the whole family, both in heaven and on earth. <span
id="fr_232"></span>[233](#fn_232.md)   For love rules willing *hearts*, but
fear the unwilling.  One kind of fear is base; but the other, leading us
as a pedagogue to good, brings us to Christ, and is saving.

<span id="iv.iii-p63"></span>XXI.  Now if one has a conception of God,
it by no means corresponds with His worthiness.  For what can the
worthiness of God be?  But let him, as far as is possible, conceive of a
great and incomprehensible and most beautiful light; inaccessible,
comprehending all good power, all comely virtue; caring for all,
compassionate, passionless, good; knowing all things, foreknowing all
things, pure, sweet, shining, stainless.

<span id="iv.iii-p64"></span>XXII.  Since the movement of the soul is
self-originated, the grace of God demands from it what the soul
possesses, willingness as its contribution to salvation.  For the soul
wishes to be its own good; which the Lord, *however*, gives it.  For it
is not devoid of sensation so as to be carried along like a body. 
Having is the result of taking, and taking of willing and desiring; and
keeping hold of what one has received, of the exercise of care and of
ability.  Wherefore God has endowed the soul with free choice, that He
may show it its duty, and that it choosing, may receive and retain.

<span id="iv.iii-p65"></span>XXIII.  As through the body the Lord spake
and healed, so also formerly by the prophets, and now by the apostles
and teachers.  For the Church is the minister of the Lord’s power. 
Thence He then assumed humanity, <span id="fr_233"></span>[234](#fn_233.md)
that by it He might <span id="page_46">p. 46</span> <span
id="iv.iii-Page_46"></span>minister to the Father’s will.  And at all
times, the God who loves humanity <span
id="fr_234"></span>[235](#fn_234.md) invests Himself with man for the
salvation of men,—in former times with the prophets, and now with the
Church.  For it is fitting that like should minister to like, in order
to a like salvation.

<span id="iv.iii-p68"></span>XXIV.  For we are of the earth.…Cæsar is
the prince, for the time being, whose earthly image is the old man, to
which he has returned.  To him, then, we are to render the earthly
things, which we bore in the image of the earthly, and the things of God
to God.  For each one of the passions is on us as a letter, and stamp,
and sign.  Now the Lord marks us with another stamp, and with other
names and letters, faith instead of unbelief, and so forth.  Thus we are
translated from what is material to what is spiritual, “having borne the
image of the heavenly.” <span id="fr_235"></span>[236](#fn_235.md)

<span id="iv.iii-p70"></span>XXV.  John says:  “I indeed baptize you
with water, but there cometh after me He that baptizeth with the Spirit
and fire.” <span id="fr_236"></span>[237](#fn_236.md)   But He baptized no
one with fire.  But some, as Heraclius says, marked with fire the ears
of those who were sealed; understanding so the apostolic saying, “For
His fan is in His hand, to purge His floor:  and He will gather the
wheat into the garner; but the chaff He will burn with fire
unquenchable.” <span id="fr_237"></span>[238](#fn_237.md)   There is
joined, then, the expression “by fire” to that “by the Spirit;” since He
separates the wheat from the chaff, that is, from the material husk, by
the Spirit; and the chaff is separated, being fanned by the wind: <span
id="fr_238"></span>[239](#fn_238.md)   so also the Spirit possesses a power
of separating material forces.  Since, then, some things are produced
from what is unproduced and indestructible,—that is, the germs of
life,—the wheat also is stored, and the material part, as long as it is
conjoined with the superior part, remains; when separated from it, it is
destroyed; for it had its existence in another thing.  This separating
element, then, is the Spirit, and the destroying element is the fire: 
and material fire is to be understood.  But since that which is saved is
like wheat, and that which grows in the soul like chaff, and the one is
incorporeal, and that which is separated is material; to the incorporeal
He opposes spirit, which is rarefied and pure—almost more so than mind;
and to the material *He opposes* fire, not as being evil or bad, but as
strong and capable of cleansing away evil.  For fire is conceived as a
good force and powerful, destructive of what is baser, and conservative
of what is better.  Wherefore this fire is by the prophets called wise.

<span id="iv.iii-p74"></span>XXVI.  Thus also, then, when God is called
“a consuming fire,” it is because a name and sign, not of wickedness,
but of power, is to be selected.  For as fire is the most potent of the
elements, and masters all things; so also God is all-powerful and
almighty, who is able to hold, to create, to make, to nourish, to make
grow, to save, having power of body and soul.  As, then, fire is
superior to the elements, so is the Almighty Ruler to gods, and powers,
and principalities.  The power of fire is twofold:  one power conduces
to the production and maturing of fruits and of animals, of which the
sun is the image; and the other to consumption and destruction, as
terrestrial fire.  When, then, God is called a consuming fire, *He is
called* a mighty and resistless power, to which nothing is impossible,
but which is able to destroy.

<span id="iv.iii-p75"></span>Respecting such a power, also, the Saviour
says, “I came to send fire upon the earth,” <span
id="fr_239"></span>[240](#fn_239.md) indicating a power to purify what is
holy, but destructive, as they say, of what is material; and, as we
should say, disciplinary.  Now fear pertains to fire, and diffusion to
light.

<span id="iv.iii-p77"></span>XXVII.  Now the more ancient men <span
id="fr_240"></span>[241](#fn_240.md) did not write, as they neither wished
to encroach on the time devoted to attention bestowed on what they
handed down, in the way of teaching, by the additional attention
bestowed on writing, nor spent the time for considering what was to be
said on writing.  And, perhaps convinced that the function of
composition and the department of teaching did not belong to the same
cast of mind, they gave way to those who had a natural turn for it.  For
in the case of a speaker, the stream of speech flows unchecked and
impetuous, and you may catch it up hastily.  But that which is always
tested by readers, meeting with strict <span
id="fr_241"></span>[242](#fn_241.md) examination, is thought worthy of the
utmost pains, and is, so to speak, the written confirmation of *oral*
instruction, and of the voice so wafted along to posterity by written
composition.  For that which was committed in trust to the elders,
speaking in writing, uses the writer’s help to hand itself down to those
who are to read it.  As, then, the magnet, repelling other matter,
attracts iron alone by reason of affinity; so also books, though many
read them, attract those alone who are capable of comprehending them. 
For the word of truth is to some “foolishness,” <span
id="fr_242"></span>[243](#fn_242.md) and to others a
“stumbling-block;” <span id="fr_243"></span>[244](#fn_243.md) but to a few
“wisdom.” <span id="fr_244"></span>[245](#fn_244.md)   So also is the power
of God found to be.  But far from the Gnostic be envy.  For it is for
this reason also that he asks whether it be worse to give to the
unworthy, or not commit to the worthy; and runs the risk, from his
abundant love of communicating, not <span id="page_47">p. 47</span>
<span id="iv.iii-Page_47"></span>only to every one who is qualified, but
sometimes also to one unworthy, who asks importunately; not on account
of his entreaty (for he loves not glory), but on account of the
persistency of the petitioner who bends his mind towards faith with
copious entreaty.

<span id="iv.iii-p83"></span>XXVIII.  There are those calling themselves
Gnostics who are envious of those in their own house more than
strangers.  And, as the sea is open to all, but one swims, another
sails, and a third catches fish; and as the land is common, but one
walks, another ploughs, another hunts,—somebody else searches the mines,
and another builds a house:  so also, when the Scripture is read, one is
helped to faith, another to morality, and a third is freed from
superstition by the knowledge of things.  The athlete, who knows the
Olympic stadium, strips for training, contends, and becomes victor,
tripping up his antagonists who contend against his scientific method,
and fighting out the contest.  For scientific knowledge <span
id="fr_245"></span>[246](#fn_245.md) is necessary both for the training of
the soul and for gravity of conduct; making the faithful more active and
keen observers of things.  For as there is no believing without
elementary instruction, so neither is there comprehension without
science. <span id="fr_246"></span>[247](#fn_246.md)

<span id="iv.iii-p86"></span>XXIX.  For what is useful and necessary to
salvation, such as *the knowledge of* the Father, and Son, and Holy
Spirit, and also of our own soul, are wholly requisite; and it is at
once beneficial and necessary to attain to the scientific account of
them.  And to those who have assumed the lead in doing good, much
experience is advantageous; so that none of the things which appear to
be known necessarily and eruditely by others may escape their notice. 
The exposition, too, of heterodox teaching affords another exercise of
the inquiring soul, and keeps the disciple from being seduced from the
truth, by his having already had practice beforehand in sounding all
round on warlike instruments of music. <span
id="fr_247"></span>[248](#fn_247.md)

<span id="iv.iii-p88"></span>XXX.  The life of the Gnostic rule, (as
they say that Crete was barren of deadly animals,) is pure from every
evil deed, and thought, and word; not only hating no one, but beyond
envy and hatred, and all evil-speaking and slander.

<span id="iv.iii-p89"></span>XXXI.  In length of days, it is not on
account of his having lived long that the man is to be regarded happy,
to whose lot it has also fallen, through his having lived, to be worthy
of living for ever.  He has pained no one, except in instructing by the
word the wounded in heart, as it were by a salutary honey, which is at
once sweet and pungent.  So that, above all, the Gnostic preserves the
decorous along with that which is in accordance with reason.  For
passion being cut away and stript off from the whole soul, he henceforth
consorts and lives with what is noblest, which has now become pure, and
emancipated to adoption.

<span id="iv.iii-p90"></span>XXXII.  Pythagoras thought that he who gave
things their names, ought to be regarded not only the most intelligent,
but the oldest of the wise men.  We must, then, search the Scriptures
accurately, since they are admitted to be expressed in parables, and
from the names hunt out the thoughts which the Holy Spirit, propounding
respecting things, teaches by imprinting His mind, so to speak, on the
expressions; that the names used with various meanings, being made the
subject of accurate investigation, may be explained, and that that which
is hidden under many integuments may, being handled and learned, come to
light and gleam forth.  For so also lead turns white as you rub it;
white lead being produced from black.  So also scientific knowledge
(gnosis), shedding its light and brightness on things, shows itself to
be in truth the divine wisdom, the pure light, which illumines the men
whose eyeball is clear, unto the sure vision and comprehension of truth.

<span id="iv.iii-p91"></span>XXXIII.  Lighting, then, our torch <span
id="fr_248"></span>[249](#fn_248.md) at the source of that light, by the
passionate desire which has it for its object, and striving as much as
possible to be assimilated to it, we become men <span
id="fr_249"></span>[250](#fn_249.md) full of light, <span
id="fr_250"></span>[251](#fn_250.md) Israelites indeed.  For He called
those friends and brethren who by desire and pursuit aimed after
likeness to the Divinity.

<span id="iv.iii-p95"></span>XXXIV.  Pure places and meadows have
received voices and visions of holy phantasms. <span
id="fr_251"></span>[252](#fn_251.md)   But every man who has been perfectly
purified, shall be thought worthy of divine teaching and of power.

<span id="iv.iii-p97"></span>XXXV.  Now I know that the mysteries of
science (gnosis) are a laughing-stock to many, especially when not
patched up with sophistical figurative language.  And the few are at
first startled at them; as when light is suddenly brought into a
convivial party in the dark.  Subsequently, on getting used and
accustomed, and trained to reasoning, as if gladdened and exulting for
delight, they *praise* the Lord.…For as pleasure has for its essence
release from pain; so also has knowledge the removal of ignorance.  For
as those that are most asleep think they are most awake, being under the
power of dream-visions very vivid and fixed; so those that are most
ignorant think that they know most.  But blessed are they who rouse
themselves from this sleep and derangement, and raise their eyes to the
light and the truth.

<span id="iv.iii-p98"></span>XXXVI.  It is, therefore, equally requisite
for him who wishes to have a pupil who is docile, <span id="page_48">p.
48</span> <span id="iv.iii-Page_48"></span>and has blended faith with
aspiration, to exercise himself and constantly to study by himself,
investigating the truth of his speculations; and when he thinks himself
right, to descend to questions regarding things contiguous.  For the
young birds make attempts to fly in the nest, exercising their wings.

<span id="iv.iii-p99"></span>XXXVII.  For Gnostic virtue everywhere
makes man good, and meek, and harmless, <span
id="fr_252"></span>[253](#fn_252.md) and painless, and blessed, and ready
to associate in the best way with all that is divine, in the best way
with men, at once a contemplative and active divine image, and turns him
into a lover of what is good by love.  For what is good, <span
id="fr_253"></span>[254](#fn_253.md) as there it is contemplated and
comprehended by wisdom, is here by self-control and righteousness
carried into effect through faith:  practising in the flesh an angelic
ministry; hallowing the soul in the body, as in a place clear and
stainless.

<span id="iv.iii-p102"></span>XXXVIII.  Against Tatian, <span
id="fr_254"></span>[255](#fn_254.md) who says that the words, “Let there be
light,” <span id="fr_255"></span>[256](#fn_255.md) are supplicatory.  If,
then, He is supplicating the supreme God, how does He say, “I am God,
and beside me there is none else?” <span
id="fr_256"></span>[257](#fn_256.md)   We have said that there are
punishments for blasphemies, for nonsense, for outrageous expressions;
which are punished and chastised by reason.

<span id="iv.iii-p106"></span>XXXIX.  And he said, too, that on account
of their hair and finery, women are punished by the Power that is set
over these matters; which also gave to Samson strength in his hair;
which punishes the women who allure to fornication through the adornment
of their hair.

<span id="iv.iii-p107"></span>XL.  As by the effluence of good, people
are made good; in like manner are they made bad.  Good is the judgment
of God, and the discrimination of the believing from the unbelieving,
and the judgment beforehand, so as not to fall into greater
judgment—this judgment being correction.

<span id="iv.iii-p108"></span>XLI.  Scripture says that infants which
are exposed are delivered to a guardian angel, and that by him they are
trained and reared.  “And they shall be,” it says, “as the faithful in
this world of a hundred years of age.”  Wherefore also Peter, in the
Revelation, <span id="fr_257"></span>[258](#fn_257.md) says:  “And a flash
of fire, leaping from those infants, and striking the eyes of the
women.”  For the just shines:  forth as a spark in a reed, and will
judge the nations. <span id="fr_258"></span>[259](#fn_258.md)

<span id="iv.iii-p111"></span>XLII.  “With the holy Thou wilt be
holy.” <span id="fr_259"></span>[260](#fn_259.md)   “According to thy
praise is thy name glorified;” God being glorified through our
knowledge, and through the inheritance.  Thus also it is said, “The Lord
liveth,” and “The Lord hath risen.” <span
id="fr_260"></span>[261](#fn_260.md)

<span id="iv.iii-p114"></span>XLIII.  “A people whom I knew not hath
served me;” <span id="fr_261"></span>[262](#fn_261.md) —by covenant I knew
them not, alien sons, who desired what pertained to another.

<span id="iv.iii-p116"></span>XLIV.  “Magnifying the salvations of His
king.” <span id="fr_262"></span>[263](#fn_262.md)   All the faithful are
called kings, brought to royalty through inheritance.

<span id="iv.iii-p118"></span>XLV.  Long-suffering is sweetness above
honey; not because it is long-suffering, but in consequence of the fruit
of long-suffering.  Since, then, the man of self-control is devoid of
passion, inasmuch as he restrains the passions, not without toil; but
when habit is formed, he is no longer a man of self-control, the man
having come under the influence of one habit and of the Holy Spirit.

<span id="iv.iii-p119"></span>XLVI.  The passions that are in the soul
are called spirits,—not spirits of power, since in that case the man
under the influence of passion would be a legion of demons; but *they
are so called* in consequence of the impulse they communicate.  For the
soul itself, through modifications, taking on this and that other sort
of qualities of wickedness, is said to receive spirits.

<span id="iv.iii-p120"></span>XLVII.  The Word does not bid us renounce
property; <span id="fr_263"></span>[264](#fn_263.md) but to manage property
without inordinate affection; and on anything happening, not to be vexed
or grieved; and not to desire to acquire.  Divine Providence bids keep
away from possession accompanied with passion, and from all inordinate
affection, and *from this* turns back those still remaining <span
id="fr_264"></span>[265](#fn_264.md) in the flesh.

<span id="iv.iii-p123"></span>XLVIII.  For instance, Peter says in the
Apocalypse, <span id="fr_265"></span>[266](#fn_265.md) that abortive
infants shall share the better fate; <span
id="fr_266"></span>[267](#fn_266.md) that these are committed to a guardian
angel, so that, on receiving knowledge, they may obtain the better
abode, having had the same experiences which they would have had had
they been in the body.  But the others shall obtain salvation merely, as
being injured and pitied, and remain without punishment, receiving this
reward.

<span id="iv.iii-p126"></span>XLIX.  The milk of women, flowing from the
breasts and thickening, says Peter in the Apocalypse, <span
id="fr_267"></span>[268](#fn_267.md) will produce minute beasts, that prey
on flesh, and running back into them will consume them:  teaching that
punishments arise for sins.  He says that they are produced from sins;
as it was for their sins that the people were sold.  And for their want
of faith in Christ, as the apostle says, they were bitten by serpents.

<span id="iv.iii-p128"></span><span id="page_49">p. 49</span> <span
id="iv.iii-Page_49"></span>L.  An ancient said that the embryo is a
living thing; for that the soul entering into the womb after it has been
by cleansing prepared for conception, and introduced by one of the
angels who preside over generation, and who knows the time for
conception, moves the woman to intercourse; and that, on the seed being
deposited, the spirit, which is in the seed, is, so to speak,
appropriated, and is thus assumed into conjunction in the process of
formation.  He cited as a proof to all, how, when the angels give glad
tidings to the barren, they introduce souls before conception.  And in
the Gospel “the babe leapt” <span id="fr_268"></span>[269](#fn_268.md) as a
living thing.  And the barren are barren for this reason, that the soul,
which unites for the deposit of the seed, is not introduced so as to
secure conception and generation.

<span id="iv.iii-p130"></span>LI.  “The heavens declare the glory of
God.” <span id="fr_269"></span>[270](#fn_269.md)   The heavens are taken in
various meanings, both those defined by space and revolution, and those
by covenant,—the immediate operation of the first-created angels.  For
the covenants caused a more especial appearance of angels,—that <span
id="fr_270"></span>[271](#fn_270.md) in the case of Adam, that in the case
of Noah, that in the case of Abraham, that in the case of Moses.  For,
moved by the Lord, the first-created angels exercised their influence on
the angels attached to the prophets, considering the covenants the glory
of God.  Furthermore, the things done on earth by angels were done by
the first-created angels to the glory of God.

<span id="iv.iii-p133"></span>LII.  It is the Lord that is principally
denominated the Heavens, and then the First-created; and after these
also the holy men before the Law, as the patriarchs, and Moses, and the
prophets; then also the apostles.  “And the firmament showeth His
handiwork.”  He applies the term “firmament” <span
id="fr_271"></span>[272](#fn_271.md) to God, the passionless and
immoveable, as also elsewhere the same David says, “I will love Thee, O
Lord, my strength <span id="fr_272"></span>[273](#fn_272.md) and my
refuge.” <span id="fr_273"></span>[274](#fn_273.md)   Accordingly, the
firmament itself shows forth the work of His hands,—that is, shows and
manifests the work of His angels.  For He shows forth and manifests
those whom He hath made.

<span id="iv.iii-p137"></span>LIII.  “Day unto day uttereth speech.”  As
the heavens have various meanings, so also has day.  Now speech is the
Lord; and He is also frequently called day.  “And night unto night
showeth forth knowledge.”  The devil knew that the Lord was to come. 
But he did not believe that He was God; wherefore also he tempted Him,
in order to know if He were powerful.  It is said, “he left <span
id="fr_274"></span>[275](#fn_274.md) Him, and departed from Him for a
season;” that is, he postponed the discovery till the resurrection.  For
he knew that He who was to rise was the Lord.  Likewise also the demons;
since also they suspected that Solomon was the Lord, and they knew that
he was not so, on his sinning.  “Night to night.”  All the demons knew
that He who rose after the passion was the Lord.  And already
Enoch <span id="fr_275"></span>[276](#fn_275.md) had said, that the angels
who transgressed taught men astronomy and divination, and the rest of
the arts.

<span id="iv.iii-p140"></span>LIV.  “There are no speeches or words
whose voices are not heard,” neither of days nor nights.  “Their sound
is gone forth unto all the earth.”  He has transferred the discourse to
the saints alone, whom he calls both heavens and days.

<span id="iv.iii-p141"></span>LV.  The stars, spiritual bodies, that
have communications with the angels set over them, and are governed by
them, are not the cause of the production of things, but are signs of
what is taking place, and will take place, and have taken place in the
case of atmospheric changes, of fruitfulness and barrenness, of
pestilence and fevers, and in the case of men.  The stars do not in the
least degree exert influences, but indicate what is, and will be, and
has been.

<span id="iv.iii-p142"></span>LVI.  “And in the sun hath He set His
tabernacle.”  There is a transposition here.  For it is of the second
coming that the discourse is.  So, then, we must read what is transposed
in its due sequence:  “And he, as a bridegroom issuing from his chamber,
will rejoice as a giant to run his way.  From heaven’s end is his going
forth; and there is no one who shall hide himself from his heat;” and
then, “He hath set His tabernacle in the sun.”

<span id="iv.iii-p143"></span>Some say that He deposited the Lord’s body
in the sun, as Hermogenes.  And “His tabernacle,” some say, is His body,
others the Church of the faithful.

<span id="iv.iii-p144"></span>Our Pantænus <span
id="fr_276"></span>[277](#fn_276.md) used to say, that prophecy utters its
expressions indefinitely for the most part, and uses the present for the
future, and again the present for the past.  Which is also seen
here. <span id="fr_277"></span>[278](#fn_277.md)   For “He hath set” is put
both for the past and the future.  For the future, because, on the
completion of this period, which is to run according to its
present <span id="fr_278"></span>[279](#fn_278.md) constitution, the Lord
will come to restore the righteous, the faithful, in whom He rests, as
in a tent, to one and the same unity; for all are one body, of the same
race, and have chosen the same faith and righteousness.  But some as
head, some as eyes, some as ears, some as hands, some as breasts, some
as feet, shall be set, resplendent, in the sun.  “Shine forth as the
sun,” <span id="fr_279"></span>[280](#fn_279.md) or in the sun; since an
angel <span id="page_50">p. 50</span> <span
id="iv.iii-Page_50"></span>high in command is in the sun.  For he is
appointed for rule over days; as the moon is for ruling over
night. <span id="fr_280"></span>[281](#fn_280.md)   Now angels are called
days.  Along with the angels in <span id="fr_281"></span>[282](#fn_281.md)
the sun, it is said, they shall have assigned to them one abode, to be
for some time and in some respects the sun, as it were the head of the
body which is one.  And, besides, they also are the rulers of the days,
as that angel in the sun, for the greater purpose for which he before
them <span id="fr_282"></span>[283](#fn_282.md) migrated to the same
place.  And again destined to ascend progressively, they reach the first
abode, in accordance with the past “He hath set:”  so that the
first-created angels shall no longer, according to providence, exercise
a definite ministry, but may be in repose, and devoted to the
contemplation of God alone; while those next to them shall be promoted
to the post which they have left; and so those beneath them similarly.

<span id="iv.iii-p152"></span>LVII.  There are then, according to the
apostle, those on the summit, <span id="fr_283"></span>[284](#fn_283.md)
the first-created.  And they are thrones, although Powers, being the
first-created, inasmuch as God rests in them, as also in those who
believe.  For each one, according to his own stage of advancement
possesses the knowledge of God in a way special to himself; and in this
knowledge God reposes, those who possess knowledge being made immortal
by knowledge.  And is not “He set His tabernacle in the sun” to be
understood thus?  God “set in the sun,” that is, in the God who is
beside Him, as in the Gospel, Eli, Eli, <span
id="fr_284"></span>[285](#fn_284.md) instead of my God, my God.  And what
is “above all rule, and authority, and power, and every name that is
named,” are those from among men that are made perfect as angels and
archangels, *so as to rise* to the nature of the angels first-created. 
For those who are changed from men to angels are instructed for a
thousand years by the angels after they are brought to perfection.  Then
those who have taught are translated to archangelic authority; and those
who have learned instruct those again who from men are changed to
angels.  Thus afterwards, in the prescribed periods, they are brought to
the proper angelic state of the body.

<span id="iv.iii-p155"></span>LVIII.  “The law of God is perfect,
converting souls.” <span id="fr_285"></span>[286](#fn_285.md)   The Saviour
Himself is called Law and Word, as Peter in “the Preaching,” and the
prophet:  “Out of Zion shall go forth the Law, and the Word of the Lord
from Jerusalem.” <span id="fr_286"></span>[287](#fn_286.md)

<span id="iv.iii-p158"></span>LIX.  “The testimony of the Lord is sure,
making children wise.”  The covenant of the Lord is true, making wise
children; those free from evil, both the apostles, and then also us. 
Besides, the testimony of the Lord, according to which He rose again
after His passion, having been verified by fact, led the Church to
confirmation in faith.

<span id="iv.iii-p159"></span>LX.  “The fear of the Lord is pure,
enduring for ever.”  He says that those who have been turned from fear
to faith and righteousness endure for ever.

<span id="iv.iii-p160"></span>“The judgments of the Lord are
true,”—sure, and incapable of being overturned; and giving rewards
according to what is right, bringing the righteous to the unity of the
faith.  For this is shown in the words, “justified for the same.” <span
id="fr_287"></span>[288](#fn_287.md)   “Such desires <span
id="fr_288"></span>[289](#fn_288.md) are above gold and precious stone.”

<span id="iv.iii-p163"></span>LXI.  “For also Thy servant keeps them.” 
Not that David alone is called servant; but the whole people saved is
called the servant of God, in virtue of obedience to the command.

<span id="iv.iii-p164"></span>LXII.  “Cleanse me from my secret
*faults*;”—thoughts contrary to right reason—defects.  For He calls this
foreign to the righteous man.

<span id="iv.iii-p165"></span>LXIII.  “If they have not dominion over
me, then shall I be innocent.”  If those who persecute me as they did
the Lord, do not have dominion over me, I shall not be innocent.  For no
one becomes a martyr unless he is persecuted; nor appears righteous,
unless, being wronged, he takes no revenge; nor forbearing…
