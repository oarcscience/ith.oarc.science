<span id="v.ii-p4"></span><span class="c9"><span

<span id="v.ii-p5"></span> ————————————

<span id="v.ii-p6"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="v.ii-p6.1"></span>Among</span> the “Pseudo-Clementina” the *Two
Epistles concerning Virginity* must properly be placed.  The evidence
against the genuineness seems conclusive; yet, with the exception of the
homily usually styled the *Second Epistle of Clement*, <span
id="fr_289"></span>[290](#fn_289.md) no spurious writings attributed to the
great Roman Father can be assigned an earlier date than these two
letters.  Uhlhorn, in view of the reference to the *sub-introductæ*,
thinks they were written shortly before the time of Cyprian; <span
id="fr_290"></span>[291](#fn_290.md) and this seems very probable.  Jerome
was acquainted with the writings (*Ad Jovinum*, i. 12), and possibly
Epiphanius (*Hær*., xxx. 15).  Hence we may safely allow an early date. 
Yet these evidences of age tell against the genuineness.

<span id="v.ii-p9"></span>1.  Early works of this character would not
have disappeared from notice to such an extent, had they been
authenticated as writings of Clement.  Supporting, as they do, the
ascetic tendency prevalent in the Western Church at and after the date
when they are first noticed by Christian writers, they would have been
carefully preserved and frequently cited, had they been genuine.  The
name of the great Roman Father would have been so weighty, that the
advocates of celibacy would have kept the documents in greater
prominence.  The silence of Eusebius respecting the letters is an
important fact in this discussion.

<span id="v.ii-p10"></span>2.  A second argument against the genuineness
is derived from the ascetic tone itself.  Such pronounced statements are
not, we must firmly hold, to be found in the Christian literature of the
sub-apostolic age.  This historical argument is further sustained by
other indications in the epistles.  They point to a stage of
ecclesiastical development which belongs to a much later period than
that of Clement.

<span id="v.ii-p11"></span>3.  The use of Scripture in these letters
seems to be conclusive against the Clementine authorship.  A comparison
with the citations in the genuine Epistle of Clement shows that these
writings make much greater use of the Pauline (particularly the
Pastoral) Epistles; that the Old Testament is less frequently cited, and
that the mode of handling proof-texts is that of a later age.

<span id="v.ii-p12"></span>4.  The judgment of the most candid patristic
scholars is against the genuineness.  Of Protestants, Wetstein stands
alone in supporting the Clementine authorship; and his position is
readily explained by the fact that he discovered the Syriac version
which restored the writings to modern scholars (see below).  The
genuineness is defended by Villecourt and Beelen (see below), also by
Möhler, Champagny, and Brück.  But such experts as Mansi, Hefele, Alzog,
and Funk, among Roman Catholics, unite with Protestant scholars in
assigning a later date, and consequently in denying the Clementine
authorship.

id="v.ii-p13.1"></span>Translator’s Introductory Notice.</span>

<span id="v.ii-p14"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="v.ii-p14.1"></span>While</span> the great mass of early Christian
literature bearing the name of Clement of Rome is undoubtedly spurious,
the case is somewhat different with regard to the two following
epistles.  Not only have Roman Catholic writers maintained their
genuineness with great ingenuity and learning, but Wetstein, who first
edited them, argued powerfully for their being received as the authentic
productions of Clement; and even Neander has admitted that they may
possibly have been written by that friend and fellow-labourer of the
apostles.

<span id="v.ii-p15"></span>Their literary history in modern times is
somewhat curious.  Wetstein unexpectedly discovered them appended to a
copy of the Syriac Peschito version of the New Testament furnished to
him by Sir James Porter, then British ambassador at Constantinople.  He
soon afterwards (1752) published them in Syriac, accompanied by a Latin
version of his own, with Prolegomena, in which he upheld their
genuineness.  This speedily called forth two works, one by Lardner
(1753), and a second by Venema (1754), in both of which their
authenticity was disputed.  To these writings Wetstein himself, and,
after his death, Gallandius, published rejoinders; but the question
remained as far from positive settlement as ever, and continues
*sub-judice* even at the present day

<span id="v.ii-p16"></span>It is generally admitted (and, of course,
*asserted* by those that maintain their truly Clementine origin) that
Greek was the original language of these epistles.  Many have argued
that they contain plain references to the *sub-introductæ* spoken of in
the literature of the third century, and that therefore they were
probably composed in the Oriental Church about that period.

<span id="v.ii-p17"></span>These epistles have been very carefully
edited in recent times by the Roman Catholic scholars Villecourt (1853)
and Beelen (1856).  Both have argued strenuously for the genuineness of
the letters, but it may be doubted if they have succeeded in repelling
all the objections of Lardner and Venema.  Beelen’s work is a highly
scholarly production, and his Prolegomena are marked by great fulness
and perspicuity.

<span id="v.ii-p18"></span>A German translation of these epistles was
published by Zingerle (1821).  They are now for the first time
translated into the English language.

<span id="v.ii-p19"></span>The translation is made from the text of
Beelen.

<span id="v.ii-p20"></span>The division into chapters is due to
Wetstein.
