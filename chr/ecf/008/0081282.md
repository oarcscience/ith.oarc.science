<span id="vii.xiii.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vii.xiii.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 11.</span>

<span id="vii.xiii.xii-p2"></span>Then Jesus, crying out with a loud
voice, Father, into Thy hands I shall commit my spirit, breathed His
last. <span id="fr_1910"></span>[1911](#fn_1910)   And immediately one
could see the rocks rent:  for there was an earthquake over all the
earth; and from the earthquake being violent and great, the rocks also
were rent.  And the tombs of the dead were opened, and the curtain of
the temple was rent, and there was darkness from the sixth hour till the
ninth.  And from all these things that had happened the Jews were
afraid, and said:  Certainly this was a just man.  And Longinus, the
centurion who stood by, said:  Truly this was a son of God.  Others
coming and seeing <span id="page_431">p. 431</span> <span
id="vii.xiii.xii-Page_431"></span>Him, beat their breasts from fear, and
again turned back. <span id="fr_1911"></span>[1912](#fn_1911)

<span id="vii.xiii.xii-p5"></span>And the centurion having perceived all
these so great miracles, went away and reported them to Pilate.  And
when he heard, he wondered and was astonished, and from his fear and
grief would neither eat nor drink that day.  And he sent notice, and all
the Sanhedrin came to him as soon as the darkness was past; and he said
to the people:  You know how the sun has been darkened; you know how the
curtain has been rent.  Certainly I did well in being by no means
willing to put to death the good man.  And the malefactors said to
Pilate:  This darkness is an eclipse of the sun, such as has happened
also at other times.  Then they say to him:  We hold the feast of
unleavened bread to-morrow; and we entreat thee, since the crucified are
still breathing, that their bones be broken, and that they be brought
down.  Pilate said:  It shall be so.  He therefore sent soldiers, and
they found the two robbers yet breathing, and they broke their legs; but
finding Jesus dead, they did not touch Him at all, except that a soldier
speared Him in the right side, and immediately there came forth blood
and water. <span id="fr_1912"></span>[1913](#fn_1912)

<span id="vii.xiii.xii-p7"></span>And as the *day of the*
preparation <span id="fr_1913"></span>[1914](#fn_1913) was drawing
towards evening, Joseph, a man well-born and rich, a God-fearing Jew,
finding Nicodemus, whose sentiments his foregoing speech had shown, says
to him:  I know that thou didst love Jesus when living, and didst gladly
hear his words, and I saw thee fighting with the Jews on his account. 
If, then, it seem good to thee, let us go to Pilate, and beg the body of
Jesus for burial, because it is a great sin for him to lie unburied.  I
am afraid, said Nicodemus, lest Pilate should be enraged, and some evil
should befall me.  But if thou wilt go alone, and beg the dead, and take
him, then will I also go with thee, and help thee to do everything
necessary for the burial.  Nicodemus having thus spoken, Joseph directed
his eyes to heaven, and prayed that he might not fail in his request;
and he went away to Pilate, and having saluted him, sat down.  Then he
says to him:  I entreat thee, my lord, not to be angry with me, if I
shall ask anything contrary to what seems good to your highness.  And he
said:  And what is it that thou askest?  Joseph says:  Jesus, the good
man whom through hatred the Jews have taken away to crucify, him I
entreat that thou give me for burial.  Pilate says:  And what has
happened, that we should deliver to be honoured again the dead body of
him against whom evidence of sorcery was brought by his nation, and who
was in suspicion of taking the kingdom of Cæsar, and so was given up by
us to death?  And Joseph, weeping and in great grief, fell at the feet
of Pilate, saying:  My lord, let no hatred fall upon a dead man; for all
the evil that a man has done should perish with him in his death.  And I
know your highness, how eager thou wast that Jesus should not be
crucified, and how much thou saidst to the Jews on his behalf, now in
entreaty and again in anger, and at last how thou didst wash thy hands,
and declare that thou wouldst by no means take part with those who
wished him to be put to death; for all which *reasons* I entreat thee
not to refuse my request.  Pilate, therefore, seeing Joseph thus lying,
and supplicating, and weeping, raised him up, and said:  Go, I grant
thee this dead man; take him, and do whatever thou wilt.

<span id="vii.xiii.xii-p9"></span>And then Joseph, having thanked
Pilate, and kissed his hands and his garments, went forth, rejoicing
indeed in heart as having obtained his desire, but carrying tears in his
eyes.  Thus also, though grieved, he was glad.  Accordingly he goes away
to Nicodemus, and discloses to him all that had happened.  Then, having
bought myrrh and aloes a hundred pounds, and a new tomb, <span
id="fr_1914"></span>[1915](#fn_1914) they, along with the mother of God
and Mary Magdalene and Salome, along with John, and the rest of the
women, did what was customary for the body with white linen, and placed
it in the tomb. <span id="fr_1915"></span>[1916](#fn_1915)

<span id="vii.xiii.xii-p12"></span>And the mother of God said, weeping: 
How am I not to lament thee, my son?  How should I not tear my face with
my nails?  This is that, my son, which Symeon the elder foretold to me
when I brought thee, an infant of forty days old, into the temple.  This
is the sword which now goes through my soul. <span
id="fr_1916"></span>[1917](#fn_1916)   Who shall put a stop to my tears,
my sweetest son?  No one at all except thyself alone, if, as thou
saidst, thou shalt rise again in three days.

<span id="vii.xiii.xii-p14"></span>Mary Magdalene said, weeping:  Hear,
O peoples, tribes, and tongues, and learn to what death the lawless Jews
have delivered him who did them ten thousand good deeds.  Hear, and be
astonished.  Who will let these things be heard by all the world?  I
shall go alone to Rome, to the Cæsar.  I shall show him what evil Pilate
hath done in obeying the lawless Jews.  Likewise also, Joseph lamented,
saying:  Ah, me! sweetest Jesus, most excellent of men, if indeed it be
proper to call thee man, who hast wrought such miracles as no man has
ever done.  How shall I enshroud thee?  How shall I entomb thee?  There
should now have been here those whom thou fedst with a few loaves; for
thus should I not have seemed to fail in what is due.

<span id="vii.xiii.xii-p15"></span>Then Joseph, along with Nicodemus,
went <span id="page_432">p. 432</span> <span
id="vii.xiii.xii-Page_432"></span>home; and likewise also the mother of
God, with the women, John <span id="fr_1917"></span>[1918](#fn_1917)
also being present with them.
