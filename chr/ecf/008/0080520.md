id="vi.iii.xii.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII.—Astrology Baffled by
Free-Will.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.xii.xii-p2"></span>“For, as usually happens when men
see unfavourable dreams, and can make nothing certain out of them, when
any event occurs, then they adapt what they saw in the dream to what has
occurred; so also is mathematics.  For before anything happens, nothing
is declared with certainty; but after something has happened, they
gather the causes of the event.  And thus often, when they have been at
fault, and the thing has fallen out otherwise, they take the blame to
themselves, saying that it was such and such a star which opposed, and
that they did not see it; not <span id="page_196">p. 196</span> <span
id="vi.iii.xii.xii-Page_196"></span>knowing that their error does not
proceed from their unskilfulness in their art, but from the
inconsistency of the whole system.  For they do not know what those
things are which we indeed desire to do, but in regard to which we do
not indulge our desires.  But we who have learned the reason of this
mystery know the cause, since, having freedom of will, we sometimes
oppose our desires, and sometimes yield to them. <span
id="fr_860"></span>[861](#fn_860)   And therefore the issue of human
doings is uncertain, because it depends upon freedom of will.  For a
mathematician can indeed indicate the desire which a malignant power
produces; but whether the acting or the issue of this desire shall be
fulfilled or not, no one can know before the accomplishment of the
thing, because it depends upon freedom of will.  And this is why
ignorant astrologers have invented to themselves the talk about
climacterics as their refuge in uncertainties, as we showed fully
yesterday.
