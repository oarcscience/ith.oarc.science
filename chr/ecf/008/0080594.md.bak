id="vi.iv.iii.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V.—A Charge.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.iii.v-p2"></span>“However, I wish, in the presence of
all, to remind you, for the sake of all, of the things belonging to the
administration.  It becomes you, living without reproach, with the
greatest earnestness to shake off all the cares of life, being neither a
surety, nor an advocate, nor involved in any other secular business. 
For Christ does not wish to appoint you either a judge or an arbitrator
in business, or negotiator of the secular affairs of the present life,
lest, being confined to the present cares of men, you should not have
leisure by the word of truth to separate the good among men from the
bad.  But let the disciples perform these offices to one another, and
not withdraw *you* from the discourses which are able to save.  For as
it is wicked for you to undertake secular cares, and to omit the doing
of what you have been commanded to do, so it is sin for every layman, if
they do not stand by one another even in secular necessities.  And if
all do not understand to take order that you be without care in respect
of the things in which you ought to be, let them learn it from the
deacons; that you may have the care of the Church always, in order both
to your administering it well, and to your holding forth the words of
truth.
