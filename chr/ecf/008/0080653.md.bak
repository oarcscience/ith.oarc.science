<span id="vi.iv.v.xx-p2"></span>“She, therefore, having taken up a
manner of life according to the law, was, with the daughter who had been
healed, driven out from her home by her husband, whose sentiments were
opposed to ours.  But she, being faithful to her engagements, and being
in affluent circumstances, remained a widow herself, but gave her
daughter in marriage to a certain man who was attached to the true
faith, and who was poor.  And, abstaining from marriage for the sake of
her daughter, she bought two boys and educated them, and had them in
place of sons.  And they being educated from their boyhood with Simon
Magus, have learned all things concerning him.  For such was their
friendship, that they were associated with him in all things in which he
wished to unite with them.
