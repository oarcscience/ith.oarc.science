Trouble.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xv.xviii-p2"></span>“And not to lengthen out unnecessary
details, I went to live with her, on account of her love to her
husband.  And not long after, my hands were debilitated by my gnawing of
them; and the woman who had taken me in, being wholly seized by some
malady, is confined in the house.  Since then the former compassion of
the women has declined, and I and the woman of the house are both of us
helpless.  For a long time I have sat here, as you see, begging; and
whatever I get I convey to my fellow-sufferer for our support.  Let this
suffice about my affairs.  For the rest, what hinders your fulfilling of
your promise to give me the drug, that I may give it to her also, who
desires to die; and thus I also, as you said, shall be able to escape
from life?”
