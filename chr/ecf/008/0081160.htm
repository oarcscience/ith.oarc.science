 to us to announce to us the flight of Simon, and how that very night he had hurried to Jud&aelig;a.&#160; And he found our father wailing, and with lamentations saying:&#160; &#8220;Alas, alas! unhappy man!&#160; I did not believe when I was told that he was a magician.&#160; Miserable man that I am!&#160; I have been recognised for one day by my wife and children, and have speedily gone back to my previous sad condition when I was still ignorant.&#8221;&#160; And my mother lamenting, plucked her hair; and we groaned in distress on account of the transformation of our father, and could not comprehend what in the world it could be.&#160; But Annubion stood speechless, seeing and hearing these things; while Peter said to us, his children, in the presence of all:&#160; &#8220;Believe me, this is Faustus your father.&#160; Wherefore I urge you to attend to him as being your father.&#160; For God will vouchsafe some occasion for his putting off the shape of Simon, and exhibiting again distinctly that of your father.&#8221;&#160; And saying this, and looking to my father, he said:&#160; &#8220;I permitted you to salute Appion and Annubion, since you asserted that they were your friends from childhood, but I did not permit you to associate with the magician Simon.&#8221;</p>
