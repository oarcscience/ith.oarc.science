id="vi.iv.xiv.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI.—Immortality of the
Soul.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xiv.xi-p2"></span>“And though by the dissolution of the
body you should escape punishment, how shall you be able by corruption
to flee from your soul, which is incorruptible?  For the soul even of
the wicked is immortal, for whom it were better not to have it
incorruptible.  For, being punished with endless torture under
unquenchable fire, and never dying, it can receive no end of its
misery.  But perhaps some one of you will say, ‘You terrify us, O
Peter.’  Teach us then how we can be <span id="page_287">p. 287</span>
<span id="vi.iv.xiv.xi-Page_287"></span>silent *about these things, and
yet* tell you things as they are, for not otherwise can we tell you
them.  But if we should be silent, you should be ensnared by evils
through ignorance.  But if we speak, we are suspected of terrifying you
with a false theory.  How then shall we charm that wicked *serpent* that
lurks in your *soul*, and subtilely insinuates suspicions hostile to
God, under the guise of love of God?  Be reconciled with yourselves; for
in order to your salvation recourse is to Him with well-doing. 
Unreasonable lust in you is hostile to God, for by conceit of wisdom it
strengthens ignorance.
