<span id="vi.iii.v.xxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iii.v.xxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXVIII.—God’s Justice Shown at
the Day of Judgment.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.v.xxviii-p2"></span>Then Simon:  “How can one and the
same being be both good and righteous?” <span
id="fr_690"></span>[691](#fn_690.md)   Peter answered:  “Because without
righteousness, goodness would be unrighteousness; for it is the part of
a good God to bestow His sunshine and rain equally on the just and the
unjust; <span id="fr_691"></span>[692](#fn_691.md) but this would seem to
be unjust, if He treated the good and the bad always with equal fortune,
and were it not that He does it for the sake of the fruits, which all
may equally enjoy who are born in this world.  But as the rain given by
God equally nourishes the corn and the tares, but at the time of harvest
the crops are gathered into the barn, but the chaff or the tares are
burnt in the fire, <span id="fr_692"></span>[693](#fn_692.md) so in the day
of judgment, when the righteous shall be introduced into the kingdom of
heaven, and the unrighteous shall be cast out, then also the justice of
God shall be shown.  For if He remained for ever alike to the evil and
the good, this would not only not be good, but even unrighteous and
unjust; that the righteous and the unrighteous should be held by Him in
one order of desert.”
