<span id="vii.xxxiii.ii.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vii.xxxiii.ii.ii-p1.1"></span>About the Dragon and the Young
Man.</span>

<span id="vii.xxxiii.ii.ii-p2"></span>And the apostle went forth to go
where the Lord had bidden him.  And when he came near the second
milestone he turned a little out of the way, and saw the body of a
beautiful youth lying; and he said:  Lord, was it for this that Thou
broughtest me out to come here, that I might see this trial?  Thy will
therefore be done, as Thou purposest.  And he began to pray, and to
say:  Lord, Judge of the living, and of those that are lying dead, and
Lord of all, and Father—Father not only of the souls that are in bodies,
but also of those that have gone out of them; for of the souls that are
in pollutions Thou art Lord and Judge—come at this time, when I call
upon Thee, and show Thy glory upon him that is lying down here.  And he
turned and said to those that followed him:  This affair has not
happened idly; but the enemy has wrought and effected this, that he
might make an assault upon him; and you see that he has availed himself
of no other form, and has wrought through no other living being, but
through his subject.

<span id="vii.xxxiii.ii.ii-p3"></span>And when the apostle had thus
spoken, behold, a great dragon came forth from his den, knocking his
head, and brandishing his tail down to the ground, and, using a loud
voice, said to the apostle:  I shall say before thee for what cause I
have put him to death, since thou art here in order to reprove my
works.  And the apostle says:  Yes, say on.  And the dragon:  There is a
certain woman in this place exceedingly beautiful; and as she was once
passing by, I saw her, and fell in love with her, and I followed and
watched her; and I found this young man kissing her, and he also had
intercourse with her, and did with her other shameful things.  And to me
indeed it was pleasant to tell thee this, for I know that thou art the
twin-brother of Christ, and always bringest our race to nought.  But,
not wishing to harass her, I did not at this time put him to death; but
I watched him passing by in the evening, and struck him, and killed him,
and especially as he had dared to do this on the Lord’s day. <span
id="fr_2349"></span>[2350](#fn_2349.md)   And the apostle inquired of him,
saying:  Tell me, of what seed and of what race art thou?

<span id="vii.xxxiii.ii.ii-p5"></span>And he said to him:  I am the
offspring of the race of the serpent, and hurtful of the hurtful; I am
son of him who hurt and struck the four brothers that stood; I am son of
him who sits on the throne of destruction, and takes his own from what
he has lent; <span id="fr_2350"></span>[2351](#fn_2350.md) I am son of that
apostate who encircles the globe; I am kinsman to him who is outside of
the ocean, whose tail lies in his mouth; I am he who went into paradise
through the hedge, and spoke with Eve what my father bade me speak to
her; I am he who inflamed and fired Cain to kill his brother, and
through me thorns and prickles sprang up in the ground; I am he who cast
down the angels from above, and bound them down by the desires of women,
that earth-born <span id="fr_2351"></span>[2352](#fn_2351.md) children
might be produced from them, and that I might work my will in
them; <span id="fr_2352"></span>[2353](#fn_2352.md) I am he who hardened
the heart of Pharaoh, that he should murder the children of Israel, and
keep them down by the hard yoke of slavery; I am he who caused the
multitude to err in the desert when they made the <span id="page_543">p.
543</span> <span id="vii.xxxiii.ii.ii-Page_543"></span>calf; I am he who
inflamed Herod and incited Caiaphas to the lying tales of falsehood
before Pilate, for this became me; I am he who inflamed Judas, and
bought him, that he should betray Christ; I am he who inhabits and holds
the abyss of Tartarus, and the Son of God has wronged me against my
will, and has gathered his own out of me; I am the kinsman of him who is
to come from the east, to whom also power has been given to do whatever
he will upon the earth.

<span id="vii.xxxiii.ii.ii-p9"></span>And that dragon having thus spoken
in the hearing of all the multitude, the apostle raised his voice on
high, and said:  Cease henceforth, O thou most unabashed, and be ashamed
and altogether put to death; for the end of thy destruction is at hand,
and do not dare to say what thou hast done through thy dependants.  And
I order thee, in the name of that Jesus who even until now makes a
struggle against you for the sake of His own human beings, to suck out
the poison which thou hast put into this man, and to draw it forth, and
take it out of him.  And the dragon said:  The time of our end is by no
means at hand, as thou hast said.  Why dost thou force me to take out
what I have put into him, and to die before the time?  Assuredly, when
my father shall draw forth and suck out what he has put into the
creation, then his end will come.  And the apostle said to him:  Show
us, therefore, now the nature of thy father.  And the dragon went up,
and put his mouth upon the wound of the young man, and sucked the gall
out of it.  And in a short time the skin of the young man, which was
like purple, grew white, and the dragon swelled.  And when the dragon
had drawn up all the gall into himself, the young man sprang up and
stood, and ran and fell at the apostle’s feet.  And the dragon, being
swelled up, shrieked out and died, and his poison and gall were poured
forth; and in the place where his poison was poured forth there was made
a great chasm, and that dragon was swallowed up.  And the apostle said
to the king and his brother:  Take workmen, and fill up the place in
which the dragon has been swallowed up, and lay foundations, and build
houses-above it, that it may be made a dwelling-place for the strangers.

<span id="vii.xxxiii.ii.ii-p10"></span>And the young man said to the
apostle, with many tears:  I have sinned against the God proclaimed by
thee, and against thee, but I ask pardon of thee; for thou art a man
having two forms, and wherever thou wishest there art thou found, and
thou art held in by no one, as I see.  For I beheld that man, when I
stood beside thee, who also said to thee, I have many wonders to show by
means of thee, and I have great works to accomplish by means of thee,
for which thou shalt obtain a reward; and thou shalt make many to live,
and they shall be in repose and eternal light as the children of God: 
do thou therefore bring alive—he says, speaking to thee about me—this
young man who has been cast down by the enemy, and in all time be the
overseer of him.  Thou hast, then, well come hither, and again thou
shalt well go away to him, he being not at all forsaken by thee.  And I
am without care and reproach, for the dawn has risen upon me from the
care of the night, and I am at rest; and I have also been released from
him who exasperated me to do these things:  for I have sinned against
Him who taught me the contrary, and I have destroyed him who is the
kinsman of the night, who forced me to sin by his own practices; and I
have found that kinsman of mine who is like the light.  I have destroyed
him who darkens and blinds those who are subject to him, lest they
should know what they are doing, and, ashamed of their works, withdraw
themselves from them, and their deeds have an end:  and I have found Him
whose works are light, and whose deeds are truth, of which whoever does
them shall not repent.  I have been set free also from him in whom
falsehood abides, whom darkness as a covering goes before, and shame
conducting herself impudently in idleness follows after.  And I have
found also Him who shows me what is beautiful, that I should lay hold of
it, the Son of the truth, who is kinsman of concord, who, driving away
the mist, enlightens His own creation, and heals its wounds, and
overturns its enemies.  But I entreat thee, O man of God, make me again
to behold and see Him, now become hidden from me, that I may also hear
His voice, the wonders of which I cannot declare:  for it is not of the
nature of this bodily organ.

<span id="vii.xxxiii.ii.ii-p11"></span>And the apostle said to him:  If,
as thou hast also said, thou hast cast off the knowledge of those things
which thou hast received, and if thou knowest who has wrought these
things in thee, and if thou shalt become a disciple and hearer of Him of
whom, through thy living love, thou now desirest the sight, thou shalt
both see Him, and shalt be with Him for ever, and shalt rest in His
rest, and shalt be in His joy.  But if thou art rather carelessly
disposed towards Him, and again returnest to thy former deeds, and
lettest go that beauty and that beaming countenance which has now been
displayed to thee, and if the splendour of the light of Him whom thou
now desirest be forgotten by thee, thou shalt be deprived not only of
this life, but also of that which is to come; and thou shalt go to him
whom thou hast said thou hast destroyed, and shalt no longer behold Him
whom thou hast said thou hast found.

<span id="vii.xxxiii.ii.ii-p12"></span>And when the apostle had thus
spoken, he went into the city, holding that young man by <span
id="page_544">p. 544</span> <span
id="vii.xxxiii.ii.ii-Page_544"></span>the hand, and saying to him: 
Those things which thou hast beheld, my child, are a few out of the many
which God has:  for it is not about these things that appear that the
good news is brought to us, but greater things than these are promised
to us; but inasmuch as we are in the body, we cannot tell and speak out
what He will do for our souls.  If we say that He affords us light, it
is seen by us, and we have it; and if riches, they exist and appear in
this world, and we name them, since it has been said, With difficulty
will a rich man enter into the kingdom of the heavens. <span
id="fr_2353"></span>[2354](#fn_2353.md)   And if we speak of fine clothing,
which they who delight in this life put on, it has been said, They that
wear soft things are in kings’ palaces; <span
id="fr_2354"></span>[2355](#fn_2354.md) and if costly dinners, about these
we have received a commandment to keep away from them, not to be
burdened by carousing and drunkenness and the cares of life; <span
id="fr_2355"></span>[2356](#fn_2355.md) as also in the Gospel it has been
said, Take no heed for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall
drink; nor for your body, what ye shall put on:  because the life is
more than food, and the body than clothing. <span
id="fr_2356"></span>[2357](#fn_2356.md)   And if we speak of this rest
lasting only for a season, its judgment has also been ordained.  But we
speak about the upper world, about God and angels, about ambrosial food,
about garments that last and become not old, about those things which
eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, nor hath there come into the heart of
sinful men what God has prepared for those that love Him. <span
id="fr_2357"></span>[2358](#fn_2357.md)   Do thou also therefore believe in
Him, that thou mayst live; and have confidence in Him, and thou shalt
never die.  For He is not persuaded by gifts, that thou shouldst offer
them to Him; nor does He want sacrifices, that thou shouldst sacrifice
to Him.  But look to Him, and thou shalt not look in vain, for His
comeliness and desirable beauty will make thee love Him; and neither
will He allow thee to turn thyself away from Him.

<span id="vii.xxxiii.ii.ii-p18"></span>And when the apostle was thus
speaking to that young man, a great multitude joined them.  And the
apostle looked, and saw them lifting themselves up that they might see
him; and they went up into elevated places.  And the apostle said to
them:  Ye men who have come to the assembly of Christ, and who wish to
believe in Jesus, take an example from this, and see that if you do not
get high up, you cannot see me, who am small, and cannot get a look of
me, who am like yourselves.  If, then, you cannot see me, who am like
yourselves, unless you raise yourselves a little from the earth, how can
you see Him who lives above, and is now found below, unless you first
raise yourselves out of your former behaviour, and unprofitable deeds,
and troublesome desires, and the riches that are left behind here, and
create things that are of the earth, and that grow old, and the garments
that are destroyed, and the beauty that ages and vanishes away, yea,
even out of the whole body in which all these have been stored past, and
which grows old, and becomes dust, returning into its own nature? for
all these things the body itself sets up. <span
id="fr_2358"></span>[2359](#fn_2358.md)   But rather believe in our Lord
Jesus Christ, whom we proclaim to you, in order that your hope may be
upon Him, and that you may have life in Him to ages of ages, that He may
be your fellow-traveller in this land, and may release you from error,
and may become <span id="fr_2359"></span>[2360](#fn_2359.md) a haven for
you in this troublous sea.  And there shall be for you also a fountain
welling out in this thirsty land, and a fold full of food in the place
of the hungry, and rest for your souls, and also a physician for your
bodies.

<span id="vii.xxxiii.ii.ii-p21"></span>Then the multitude of those
assembled that heard, wept, and said to the apostle:  O man of God, as
for the God whom thou proclaimest, we dare not say that we are his,
because our works which we have done are alien from him, not pleasing to
him; but if he has compassion upon us, and pities us, and delivers us,
overlooking our former doings; and if he set us free from the evil
things which we did when we were in error, and shall not take into
account nor keep the recollection of our former sins, we shall become
his servants, and we shall do his will to the end.  And the apostle
answered and said to them:  He does not reckon against you the sins
which you did, being in error; but He overlooks your transgressions
which you have done in ignorance. <span
