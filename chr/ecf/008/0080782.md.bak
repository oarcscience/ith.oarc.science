id="vi.iv.vii.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXI.—Evils of Adultery.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xxi-p2"></span>“But why, it is said, if a man is
ignorant of his wife’s being an adulteress, is he not indignant,
enraged, distracted? why does he not make war?  Thus these things are
not evil by nature, but the unreasonable opinion of men make them
terrible.  But I say, that even if these dreadful things do not occur,
it is usual for a woman, through association with an adulterer, either
to forsake her husband, or if she continue to live with him, to plot
against him, or to bestow upon the adulterer the goods procured by the
labour of her husband; and having conceived by the adulterer while her
husband is absent, to attempt the destruction of that which is in her
womb, through shame of conviction, and so to become a child-murderer; or
even, while destroying it, to be destroyed along with it.  But if while
her husband is at home she conceives by the adulterer and bears a child,
the child when he grows up does not know his father, and thinks that he
is his father who is not; and thus he who is not the father, at his
death leaves his substance to the child of another.  And how many other
evils naturally spring from adultery!  And the secret evils we do not
know.  For as the mad dog destroys all that he touches, infecting them
with the unseen madness, so also the hidden evil of adultery, though it
be not known, effects the cutting off of posterity.
