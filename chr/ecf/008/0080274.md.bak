id="vi.iii.v.lxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter LXXIV.—Farewell to
Cæsarea.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.v.lxiv-p2"></span>Peter therefore ordered the letter to
be read to the people; and after the reading of it, he addressed them
and gave them full instructions about everything, but especially that
they should obey Zacchæus, whom he had ordained bishop over them.  Also
he commended the presbyters and the deacons to the people, and not less
the people to them.  And then, announcing that he should spend the
winter at Tripolis, he said:  “I commend you to the grace of God, being
about to depart to-morrow, with God’s will.  But during the whole three
months which he spent at Cæsarea, for the sake of instruction, whatever
he discoursed of in the presence of the people in the day-time, he
explained more fully and perfectly in the night, in private to us, as
more faithful and completely approved by him.  And at the same time he
commanded me, because he understood that I carefully stored in my memory
what I heard, to commit to writing whatever seemed worthy of record, and
to send it to you, my lord James, as also I did, in obedience to his
command.”
