<p class="c21"><a name="vii.vi.ix-p2"></A>And in those days, that is, at the time of her first coming into Galilee, the angel Gabriel was sent to her by God, to announce to her the conception of the Lord, and to explain to her the manner and order of the conception.&#160; Accordingly, going in, he filled the chamber where she was with a great light; and most courteously saluting her, he said:&#160; Hail, Mary!&#160; O virgin highly favoured by the Lord, virgin full of grace, the Lord is with thee; blessed art thou above all women, blessed above all men that have been hitherto born.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1699"></A><A HREF="#fn_1699"><FONT SIZE="1">1700</FONT></A>
&#160; And the virgin, who was already well acquainted with angelic faces, and was not unused to the light from heaven, was neither terrified by the vision of the angel, nor astonished at the greatness of the light, but only perplexed by his words; and she began to consider of what nature a salutation so unusual could be, or what it could portend, or what end it could have.&#160; And the angel, divinely inspired, taking up this thought, says:&#160; Fear not, Mary, as if anything contrary to thy chastity were hid under this salutation.&#160; For in choosing chastity, thou hast found favour with the Lord; and therefore thou, a virgin, shalt conceive without sin, and shalt bring forth a son.&#160; He shall be great, because He shall rule from sea to sea, and from the river even to the ends of the earth;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1700"></A><A HREF="#fn_1700"><FONT SIZE="1">1701</FONT></A>
 and He shall be called the Son of the Most High, because He who is born on earth in humiliation, reigns in heaven in exaltation; and the Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David, and He shall reign in the house of Jacob for ever, and of His kingdom there shall be no end;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1701"></A><A HREF="#fn_1701"><FONT SIZE="1">1702</FONT></A>
 forasmuch as He is King of kings and Lord of lords,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1702"></A><A HREF="#fn_1702"><FONT SIZE="1">1703</FONT></A>
 and His throne is from everlasting to everlasting.&#160; The virgin did not doubt these words of the angel; but wishing to know the manner of it, she answered:&#160; How can that come to pass?&#160; For while, according to my vow, I never know man, how can I bring forth without the addition of man&#146;s seed?&#160; To this the angel says:&#160; Think not, Mary, that thou shalt conceive in the manner of mankind:&#160; for without any intercourse with man, thou, a virgin, wilt conceive; thou, a virgin, wilt bring forth; thou, a virgin, wilt nurse:&#160; for the Holy Spirit shall come upon thee, and the power of the Most High shall overshadow thee,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1703"></A><A HREF="#fn_1703"><FONT SIZE="1">1704</FONT></A>
 without any of the heats of lust; and therefore that which shall be born of thee shall alone be holy, because it <A NAME="page_387"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 387</FONT></A> <a name="vii.vi.ix-Page_387"></A>alone, being conceived and born without sin, shall be called the Son of God.&#160; Then Mary stretched forth her hands, and raised her eyes to heaven, and said:&#160; Behold the hand-maiden of the Lord, for I am not worthy of the name of lady; let it be to me according to thy word.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.vi.ix-p8"></A>It will be long, and perhaps to some even tedious, if we insert in this little work every thing which we read of as having preceded or followed the Lord&#146;s nativity:&#160; wherefore, omitting those things which have been more fully written in the Gospel, let us come to those which are held to be less worthy of being narrated.</p>
