id="vi.iv.xx.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIX.—Opposition to Peter
Unreasonable.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xx.xix-p2"></span>“If, then, our Jesus appeared to you
in a vision, made Himself known to you, and spoke to you, it was as one
who is enraged with an adversary; and this is the reason why it was
through visions and dreams, or through revelations that were from
without, that He spoke to you.  But can any one be rendered fit for
instruction through apparitions?  And if you will say, ‘It is possible,’
then I ask, ‘Why did our teacher abide and discourse a whole year to
those who were awake?’  And how are we to believe your word, when you
tell us that He appeared to you?  And how did He appear to you, when you
entertain opinions contrary to His teaching?  But if you were seen and
taught <span id="page_324">p. 324</span> <span
id="vi.iv.xx.xix-Page_324"></span>by Him, and became His apostle for a
single hour, proclaim His utterances, interpret His sayings, love His
apostles, contend not with me who companied with Him.  For in direct
opposition to me, who am a firm rock, the foundation of the
Church, <span id="fr_1365"></span>[1366](#fn_1365.md) you now stand.  If
you were not opposed to me, you would not accuse me, and revile the
truth proclaimed by me, in order that I may not be believed when I state
what I myself have heard with my own ears from the Lord, as if I were
evidently a person that was condemned and in bad repute. <span
id="fr_1366"></span>[1367](#fn_1366.md)   But if you say that I am
condemned, you bring an accusation against God, who revealed the Christ
to me, and you inveigh against Him who pronounced me blessed on account
of the revelation.  But if, indeed, you really wish to work in the cause
of truth, learn first of all from us what we have learned from Him, and,
becoming a disciple of the truth, become a fellow-worker with us.”

<span id="vi.iv.xx.xix-p4"></span> We have adopted an emendation of
Schwegler’s.  The text reads, “in good repute.”  \[The word “condemned”
is supposed to be borrowed from the account of the contest at Antioch in
[Gal. ii. 11](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#011.md)<span
id="vi.iv.xx.xix-p4.1"></span>, where it is applied to the Apostle
Peter.  This passage has therefore been regarded as a covert attack upon
the Apostle Paul.—R.\]
