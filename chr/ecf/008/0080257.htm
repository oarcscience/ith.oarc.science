<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.v.xlvii-p2"></A>Then said Niceta:&#160; &#8220;In what respect did the Egyptians sin in not believing Moses, since the magicians wrought like signs, even although they were done rather in appearance than in truth?&#160; For if I had been there then, should I not have thought, from the fact that the magicians did like things to those which Moses did, either that Moses was a magician, or that the magicians wrought their signs by divine commission?&#160; For I should not have thought it likely that the same things could be effected by magicians, even in appearance, which he who was sent by God performed.&#160; And now, in what respect do they sin who believe Simon, since they see him do so great marvels?&#160; Or is it not marvellous to fly through the air, to be so mixed with fire as to become one body with it, to make statues walk, brazen dogs bark, and other such like things, which assuredly are sufficiently wonderful to those who know not how to distinguish?&#160; Yea, he has also been seen to make bread of stones.&#160; But if he sins who believes those who do signs, how shall it appear that he also does not sin who has believed our Lord for His signs and works of power?&#8221;</p>
