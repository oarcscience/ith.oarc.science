<span id="vi.iii.xi.ii-p2"></span>“Since, therefore, you profess to be
conversant with the position of the stars and the courses of the
heavenly bodies, and that from these you can convince Clement that all
things are subject to <span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iii.xi.ii-p2.1"></span>Genesis</span>, or that you will learn
from him that all things are governed by providence, and that we have
something in our own power, it is now time for you two to set about
this.”  To this the old man answered:  “Now indeed it was not necessary
to raise questions of this kind, if it were possible for us to learn
from the true Prophet, and to hear in a definite proposition, that
anything depends on us and on the freedom of our will; for your
yesterday’s discourse affected me greatly, in which you disputed
concerning the prophetic power. <span id="fr_834"></span>[835](#fn_834.md)
  Whence also I assent to and confirm your judgment, that nothing can be
known by man with certainty, and without doubt, seeing that he has but a
short period of life, and a brief and slender breath, by which he seems
to be kept in life.  However, since I am understood to have promised to
Clement, before I heard anything of the prophetic power, that I should
show that all things are subject to <span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iii.xi.ii-p3.1"></span>Genesis</span>, or that I should learn
from him that there is something in ourselves, let him do me this
favour, that he first begin, and propound and explain what may be
objected:  for I, ever since I heard from you a few words concerning the
power of prophecy, have, I confess, been confounded, considering the
greatness of prescience; nor do I think that anything ought to be
received which is collected from conjectures and opinion.”
