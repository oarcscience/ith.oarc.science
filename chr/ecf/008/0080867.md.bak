Men.”</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xi.ix-p2"></span>“While beginning to discourse on the
worship of God to those who are altogether ignorant of everything, and
whose minds have been corrupted by the accusations of our adversary
Simon, I have thought it necessary first of all to speak of the
blamelessness of the God who hath made all things, starting from the
occasion seasonably afforded by Him according to His providence, that it
may be known how with good reason many are held by many demons, and
subjected to strange sufferings, that in this the justice of God may
appear; and that those who through ignorance blame Him, now may learn by
good speaking and well-doing what sentiments they ought to hold, and
recall themselves from their previous accusation, assigning ignorance as
the cause of their evil presumption, in order that they may be pardoned.
