id="vi.iii.xii.xxxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXVII.—Like Gods, Like
Worshippers.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.xii.xxxvii-p2"></span>“But since those things rather
are true which the public baseness testifies, and concealments have been
sought and fabricated by prudent men to excuse them by seemly speeches,
therefore are they not only not prohibited, but even in the very
mysteries figures are produced of Saturn devouring his sons, and of the
boy hidden by the cymbals and drums of the Corybantes; and with respect
to the mutilation of Saturn, what better proof of its truth could there
be, than that even his worshippers are mutilated, by a like miserable
fate, in honour of their god?  Since then these things are manifestly
seen, who shall be found of so little sense, yea, of such stolidity,
that he does not perceive that those things are true concerning the
unfortunate gods, which their more unfortunate worshippers attest by the
wounding and mutilation of their bodies?
