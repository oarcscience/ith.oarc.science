History.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iv.vii-p2"></span>“This Simon’s father was Antonius,
and his mother Rachel.  By nation he is a Samaritan, from a village of
the Gettones; by profession a magi<span id="page_99">p. 99</span> <span
id="vi.iii.iv.vii-Page_99"></span>cian yet exceedingly well trained in
the Greek literature; desirous of glory, and boasting above all the
human race, so that he wishes himself to be believed to be an exalted
power, which is above God the Creator, and to be thought to be the
Christ, and to be called the *Standing One*.  And he uses this name as
implying that he can never be dissolved, asserting that his flesh is so
compacted by the power of his divinity, that it can endure to eternity. 
Hence, therefore, he is called the *Standing One*, as though he cannot
fall by any corruption.”
