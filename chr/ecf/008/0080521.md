<span id="vi.iii.xii.xiii-p2"></span>“If you have anything that you wish
to say to this, say on.”  Then my father:  “Nothing can be more true, my
son, than what you have stated.”  And while we were thus speaking among
ourselves, some one informed us that a great multitude of people were
standing outside, having assembled for the purpose of hearing.  Then
Peter ordered them to be admitted, for the place was large and
convenient.  And when they had come in, Peter said to us:  “If any one
of you wishes, let him address the people, and discourse concerning
idolatry.”  To whom I Clement answered:  “Your great benignity and
gentleness and patience towards all encourages us, so that we dare speak
in your presence, and ask what we please; and therefore, as I said, the
gentleness of your disposition invites and encourages all to undertake
the precepts of saving doctrine.  This I never saw before in any one
else, but in you only, with whom there is neither envy nor indignation. 
Or what do you think?
