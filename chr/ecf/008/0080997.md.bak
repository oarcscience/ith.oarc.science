<span id="vi.iv.xv.xxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.xv.xxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVI.—What is
Philanthropy.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xv.xxvi-p2"></span>Then I answered, “Do you not think,
then, that even the stranger-receiver was philanthropic, who did good to
a stranger whom she did not know?”  Then Peter said, “Compassionate,
indeed, I can call her, but I dare not call her philanthropic, just as I
cannot call a mother philoteknic, for she is prevailed on to have an
affection for them by her pangs, and by her rearing of them.  As the
lover also is gratified by the company and enjoyment of his mistress,
and the friend by return of friendship, so also the compassionate man by
misfortune.  However the compassionate man is near to the philanthropic,
in that he is impelled, apart from hunting after the receipt of
anything, to do the kindness.  But he is not yet philanthropic.”  Then I
said, “By what deeds, then, can any one be philanthropic?”  And Peter
answered, “Since I see that you are eager to hear what is the work of
philanthropy, I shall not object to telling you.  He is the
philanthropic man who does good even to <span id="page_298">p.
298</span> <span id="vi.iv.xv.xxvi-Page_298"></span>his enemies.  And
that it is so, listen:  Philanthropy is masculo-feminine; and the
feminine part of it is called <span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iv.xv.xxvi-p2.1"></span>compassion</span>, and the male part is
named love to our neighbour.  But every man is neighbour to every man,
and not merely this man or that; for the good and the bad, the friend
and the enemy, are alike men.  It behoves, therefore, him who practises
philanthropy to be an imitator of God, doing good to the righteous and
the unrighteous, as God Himself vouchsafes His sun and His heavens to
all in the present world.  But if you will do good to the good, but not
to the evil, or even will punish them, you undertake to do the work of a
judge, you do not strive to hold by philanthropy.”
