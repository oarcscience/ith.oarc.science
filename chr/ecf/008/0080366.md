id="vi.iii.viii.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XV.—Bishops, Presbyters,
Deacons, and Widows Ordained at Tripolis.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.viii.xv-p2"></span>When he had said these things, and
others to the same effect, he dismissed the crowds; and having,
according to his custom, supped with his friends, he went to sleep.  And
while in this manner he was teaching the word of God for three whole
months, and converting multitudes to the faith, at the last he ordered
me to fast; and after the fast he conferred on me the baptism of
ever-flowing water, in the fountains which adjoin the sea. <span
id="fr_788"></span>[789](#fn_788.md)   And when, for the grace of
regeneration divinely conferred upon me, we had joyfully kept holiday
with our brethren, Peter ordered those who had been appointed to go
before him, to proceed to Antioch, and there to wait three months more. 
And they having gone, he himself led down to the fountains, which, I
have said, are near the sea, those who had fully received the faith of
the Lord, and baptized them; and celebrating <span
id="fr_789"></span>[790](#fn_789.md) the Eucharist with them, he appointed,
as bishop over them, Maro, who had entertained him in his house, and who
was now perfect in all things; and with him he ordained twelve
presbyters and deacons at the same time.  He also instituted the order
of widows, and arranged all the services of the Church; and charged them
all to obey Maro their bishop in all things that he should command
them.  And thus all things being suitably arranged, when the three
months were fulfilled, we bade farewell to those who were at Tripolis,
and set out for Antioch.
