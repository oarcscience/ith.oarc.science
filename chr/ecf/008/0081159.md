id="vi.iv.xxiii.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIV.—The Change in the Form of
Faustus Caused by Simon.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxiii.xiv-p2"></span>When the person who had gone before
gave this report, Peter looked to my father, and said:  “You hear,
Faustus; the change in your form has been caused by Simon the magician,
as is now evident.  For, thinking that *a servant* <span
id="fr_1524"></span>[1525](#fn_1524) of the emperor was seeking him to
punish him, he became afraid and fled, putting you into his own shape,
that if you were put to death, your children might have sorrow.”  When
my father heard this, he wept and lamented, and said:  “You have
conjectured rightly, Peter.  For Annubion, <span id="page_344">p.
344</span> <span id="vi.iv.xxiii.xiv-Page_344"></span>who is my dear
friend, <span id="fr_1525"></span>[1526](#fn_1525) hinted his design to
me; but I did not believe him, *miserable man that I am*, <span
id="fr_1526"></span>[1527](#fn_1526) since I deserved to suffer.”
