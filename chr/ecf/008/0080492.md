id="vi.iii.xi.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIII.—Manners of the
Susidæ.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.xi.xxiii-p2"></span>“But, further, in Susæ the women
use ointments, and indeed of the best sort, being decked with ornaments
and precious stones; also they go abroad supported by the aid of their
maidservants, with much greater ambition than the men.  They do not,
however, cultivate modesty, but have intercourse indifferently with
whomsoever they please, with slaves and guests, such liberty being
allowed them by their husbands; and not only are they not blamed for
this, but they also rule over their husbands.  And yet the <span
class="c9"><span id="vi.iii.xi.xxiii-p2.1"></span>Genesis</span> of all
the Susian women has not Venus, with Jupiter and Mars in the middle of
the heaven in the houses of Jupiter.  In the remoter parts of the East,
if a boy be treated unnaturally, when it is discovered, he is killed by
his brothers, or his parents, or any of his relations, and is left
unburied.  And again, among the Gauls, an old law allows boys to be thus
treated publicly; and no disgrace is thought to attach to it.  And is it
possible, that all those who are so basely treated among the Gauls, have
had Lucifer with Mercury in the houses of Saturn and the confines of
Mars?
