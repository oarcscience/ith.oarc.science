id="vi.iii.vi.xxxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXI.—Idolatry Led to All
Immorality.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.vi.xxxi-p2"></span>“For whereas at first, men
worshipping a righteous and all-seeing God, neither dared sin nor do
injury to their neighbours, being persuaded that God sees the actions
and movements of every one; when religious worship was directed to
lifeless images, concerning which they were certain that they were
incapable of hearing, or sight, or motion, they began to sin
licentiously, and to go forward to every crime, because they had no fear
of suffering anything at the hands of those whom they worshipped as
gods.  Hence the madness of wars burst out; hence plunderings, rapines,
captivities, and liberty reduced to slavery; each one, as he could,
satisfied his lust and his covetousness, although no power can satisfy
covetousness.  For as fire, the more fuel it gets, is the more
extensively kindled and strengthened, so also the madness of
covetousness is made greater and more vehement by means of those things
which it acquires.
