<span id="vi.iii.ix.vii-p2"></span>But I trembled when I heard this, and
my tears immediately gushed forth, because so great a man, who is worth
more than the whole world, had addressed such a proposal to me.  Then
he, when he saw me weeping, inquired the reason; and I answered him: 
“How have I so sinned against you, that you should distress me with such
a proposal?”  Then Peter:  “If it is evil that I said I should serve
you, you were first in fault in saying the same thing to me.”  Then said
I:  “The cases are not alike:  for it becomes me to do this to you; but
it is grievous that you, who are sent as the herald of the Most High God
to save the souls of men, should say it to me.”  Then said Peter:  “I
should agree with you, were it not that our Lord, who came for the
salvation of the whole world, and who was nobler than any creature,
submitted to be a servant, that He might persuade us not to be ashamed
to perform the ministry of servants to our brethren.”  Then said I:  “It
were foolishness in me to suppose that I can prevail with you;
nevertheless I give thanks to the providence of God, because I have
merited to have you instead of parents.”
