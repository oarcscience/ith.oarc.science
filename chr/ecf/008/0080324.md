id="vi.iii.vii.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter X.—Jesus the True Prophet.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.vii.x-p2"></span>“He therefore is the true Prophet, who
appeared to us, as you have heard, in Judæa, who, standing in public
places, by a simple command made the blind see, the deaf hear, cast out
demons, restored health to the sick, and life to the dead; and since
nothing was impossible to Him, He even perceived the thoughts of men,
which is possible for none but God only.  He proclaimed the kingdom of
God; and we believed Him as a true Prophet in all that He spoke,
deriving the confirmation of our faith not only from His words, but also
from His works; and also because the sayings of the law, which many
generations before had set forth His coming, were fulfilled in Him; and
the figures of the doings of Moses, and of the patriarch Jacob before
him, bore in all respects a type of Him.  It is evident also that the
time of His advent, that is, the very time at which He came, was
foretold by them; and, above all, it was contained in the sacred
writings, that He was to be waited for by the Gentiles.  And all these
things were equally fulfilled in Him.
