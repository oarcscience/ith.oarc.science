<span id="vi.iv.ix.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.ix.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter III.—Appion Proceeds to Interpret
the Myths.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.ix.iii-p2"></span>“There was once a time when nothing
existed but chaos and a confused mixture of orderless elements, which
were as yet simply heaped together. <span
id="fr_1058"></span>[1059](#fn_1058.md)   This nature testifies, and great
men have been of opinion that it was so.  Of these great men I shall
bring forward to you him who excelled them all in wisdom, Homer, where
he says, with a reference to the original confused mass, ‘But may you
all become water and earth;’ <span id="fr_1059"></span>[1060](#fn_1059.md)
implying that from these all things had their origin, and that all
things return to their first state, which is chaos, when the watery and
earthy substances are separated.  And Hesiod in the <span
class="c9"><span id="vi.iv.ix.iii-p4.1"></span>Theogony</span> says,
‘Assuredly chaos was the very first to come into being.’ <span
id="fr_1060"></span>[1061](#fn_1060.md)   Now, by ‘come into being,’ he
evidently means that chaos came into being, as having a beginning, and
did not always exist, without beginning.  And Orpheus likens chaos to an
egg, in which was the confused mixture of the primordial elements.  This
chaos, which Orpheus calls an egg, is taken for granted by Hesiod,
having a beginning, produced from infinite matter, and originated in the
following way.
