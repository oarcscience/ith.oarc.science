<span id="vi.iv.xx.xviii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.xx.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.—The Nature of
Revelation.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xx.xviii-p2"></span>“Thus to me also was the Son
revealed by the Father.  Wherefore I know what is the meaning of
revelation, having learned it in my own case.  For at the very time when
the Lord said, ‘Who do they say that I am?’ <span
id="fr_1359"></span>[1360](#fn_1359.md) and when I heard one saying one
thing of Him, and another another, it came into my heart to say (and I
know not, therefore, how I said it), ‘Thou art the Son of the living
God.’ <span id="fr_1360"></span>[1361](#fn_1360.md)   But He, pronouncing
me blessed, pointed out to me that it was the Father who had revealed it
to me; and from this time I learned that revelation is knowledge gained
without instruction, and without apparition and dreams.  And this is
indeed the case.  For in the *soul* <span
id="fr_1361"></span>[1362](#fn_1361.md) which has been placed in us
by <span id="fr_1362"></span>[1363](#fn_1362.md) God, there is all the
truth; but it is covered and revealed by the hand of God, who works so
far as each one through his knowledge deserves. <span
id="fr_1363"></span>[1364](#fn_1363.md)   But the declaration of anything
by means of apparitions and dreams from without is a proof, not that it
comes from revelation, but from wrath.  Finally, then, it is written in
the law, that God, being angry, said to Aaron and Miriam, <span
id="fr_1364"></span>[1365](#fn_1364.md) ‘If a prophet arise from amongst
you, I shall make myself known to him through visions and dreams, but
not so as to my servant Moses; because I shall speak to him in an
*outward* appearance, and not through dreams, just as one will speak to
his own friend.’  You see how the statements of wrath are made through
visions and dreams, but the statements to a friend are made face to
face, in *outward* appearance, and not through riddles and visions and
dreams, as to an enemy.

<span id="vi.iv.xx.xviii-p5"></span> This word is not in the text. 
Schliemann proposed the word “heart.”  Possibly “breath” or “spirit” may
be the lost word.  See above.

<span id="vi.iv.xx.xviii-p6"></span> “By” should properly be “from.”

<span id="vi.iv.xx.xviii-p7"></span> Lit., “who produces according to
the merit of each one knowing.”  Cotelerius translated, “who, knowing
the merit of each man, does to him according to it.”  The idea seems to
be, that God uncovers the truth hidden in the soul to each man according
to his deserts.
