<span id="vi.iv.xv.xxiv-p2"></span>And then Peter having discoursed
concerning God and the service accorded to Him, he concluded as
follows:  “If any one wishes to learn these things accurately, let him
come to Antioch, where I have resolved to remain some length of time,
and learn the things that pertain to his salvation.  For if you are
familiar with leaving your country for the sake of trading or of
warfare, and coming to far-off places, you should not be unwilling to go
three days’ journey for the sake of eternal salvation.”  Then, after the
address of Peter, I presented the woman who had been healed, in the
presence of all the multitude, with a thousand drachmas, for her
support, giving her in charge to a certain good man, who was the chief
man of the city, and who of his own accord joyfully undertook the
charge.  Further, having distributed money amongst many other women, and
thanked those who at any time had comforted my mother, I sailed away to
Antaradus, along with my mother, and Peter, and the rest of our
companions; and thus we proceeded to our lodging.
