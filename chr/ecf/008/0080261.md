id="vi.iii.v.li-p1.1"></span>Chapter LXI.—Ten Pairs.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.v.li-p2"></span>“The ten pairs <span
id="fr_706"></span>[707](#fn_706.md) of which we have spoken have therefore
been assigned to this world from the beginning of time.  Cain and Abel
were one pair.  The second was the giants and Noah; the third, Pharaoh
and Abraham; the fourth, the Philistines and Isaac; the fifth, Esau and
Jacob; the sixth, the magicians and Moses the lawgiver; the seventh, the
tempter and the Son of man; the eighth, Simon and I, Peter; the ninth,
all nations, and he who shall be sent to sow the word among the nations;
the tenth, Antichrist and Christ.  Concerning these pairs we shall give
you fuller information at another time.”  When Peter spoke thus, Aquila
said:  “Truly there is need of constant teaching, that one may learn
what is true about everything.”
