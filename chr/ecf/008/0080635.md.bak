Body.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.v.ii-p2"></span>And he, breaking off the discourse in
which he was engaged, assured me, by way of apology, why he had not
awakened me that I might hear his discourses, assigning as the reason
the discomfort of my voyage.  As he wished this to be dispelled, <span
id="fr_917"></span>[918](#fn_917.md) he had suffered me to sleep.  “For,”
said he, “whenever the soul is distracted concerning some bodily want,
it does not properly approach the instructions that are presented to
it.  On this account I am not willing to converse, either with those who
are greatly grieving through some calamity, or are immoderately angry,
or are turned to the frenzy of love, or are suffering under bodily
exhaustion, or are distressed with the cares of life, or are harassed
with any other sufferings, whose soul, as I said, being downcast, and
sympathizing with the suffering body, occupies also its own intelligence
therewith.
