emperor, greeting. <span id="fr_2012"></span>[2013](#fn_2012.md)

<span id="vii.xviii-p5"></span>Upon Jesus Christ, whose case I had
clearly set forth to thee in my last, at length by the will of the
people a bitter punishment has been inflicted, myself being in a sort
unwilling and rather afraid.  A man, by Hercules, so pious and strict,
no age has ever had nor will have.  But wonderful were the efforts of
the people themselves, and the unanimity of all the scribes and chief
men and elders, to crucify this ambassador of truth, notwithstanding
that their own prophets, and after our manner the sibyls, warned them
against it:  and supernatural signs appeared while he was hanging, and,
in the opinion of philosophers, threatened destruction to the whole
world.  His disciples are flourishing, in their work and the regulation
of their lives not belying their master; yea, in his name most
beneficent.  Had I not been afraid of the rising of a sedition among the
people, who were just on the point of breaking out, perhaps this man
would still have been alive to us; although, urged more by fidelity to
thy dignity than induced by my own wishes, I did not according to my
strength resist that innocent blood free from the whole charge *brought
against it*, but unjustly, through the malignity of men, should be sold
and suffer, yet, as the Scriptures signify, to their own destruction. 
Farewell.  28th March.
