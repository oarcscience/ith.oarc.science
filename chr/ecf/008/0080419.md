<span id="vi.iii.x.xiii-p2"></span>“Now, in the meantime, that this
visible world has been made, very many wise men among the philosophers
do testify.  But that we may not seem to make use of assertions as
witnesses, as though we needed them, let us inquire, if you please,
concerning its principles.  That this visible world is material, is
sufficiently evident from the fact that it is visible.  But every body
receives *one of* two <span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iii.x.xiii-p2.1"></span>Differentiæ</span>; for it is either
compact and solid, or divided and separate.  And if the body of which
the world was made was compact and solid, and that body was parted and
divided through diverse species and parts according to its differences,
there must necessarily be understood to have been some one to separate
the body which was compact and solid, and to draw it into many parts and
diverse forms; or if all this mass of the world was compounded and
compacted from diverse and dispersed parts of bodies, still there must
be understood to have been some one to collect into one the dispersed
parts, and to invest these things with their different species.
