<span id="vi.iii.v.xl-p2"></span>“You therefore who are turned to the
Lord by repentance, bend to Him your knees.”  When he had said this, all
the multitude bent their knees to God; and Peter, looking towards
heaven, prayed for them with tears that God, for His goodness, would
deign to receive those betaking themselves to Him.  And after he had
prayed and had instructed them to meet early the next day, he dismissed
the multitude.  Then according to custom, having taken food, we went to
sleep.
