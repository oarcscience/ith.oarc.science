id="vi.iii.iii.xxxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXII.—Abraham.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iii.xxxii-p2"></span>“In the twenty-first generation
there was a certain wise man, of the race of those who were expelled, of
the family of Noah’s eldest son, by name Abraham, from whom our Hebrew
nation is derived. <span id="fr_553"></span>[554](#fn_553.md)   When the
whole world was again overspread with errors, and when for the
hideousness of its crimes destruction was ready for it, this time not by
water, but fire, and when already the scourge was hanging over the whole
earth, beginning with Sodom, this man, by reason of his friendship with
God, who was well pleased with him, obtained from God that the whole
world should not equally perish.  From the first this same man, being an
astrologer, was able, from the account and order of the stars, to
recognise the Creator, while all others were in error, and understood
that all things are regulated by His providence.  Whence also an
angel, <span id="fr_554"></span>[555](#fn_554.md) standing by him in a
vision, instructed him more fully concerning those things which he was
beginning to perceive.  He showed him also what belonged to his race and
posterity, and promised him that those districts should be restored
rather than given to them.
