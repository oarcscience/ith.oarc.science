id="vi.iv.xvi.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVI.—Peter’s Speech
Continued.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xvi.xvi-p2"></span>“The chaste woman is adorned with the
Son of God as with a bridegroom.  She is clothed with holy light.  Her
beauty lies in a well-regulated soul; and she is fragrant with ointment,
even with a good reputation.  She is arrayed in beautiful vesture, even
in modesty.  She wears about her precious pearls, even chaste words. 
And she is radiant, for <span id="fr_1178"></span>[1179](#fn_1178.md) her
mind has been brilliantly lighted up.  Onto a beautiful mirror does she
look, for she looks into God.  Beautiful cosmetics <span
id="fr_1179"></span>[1180](#fn_1179.md) does she use, namely, the fear of
God, with which she admonishes her soul.  Beautiful is the woman not
because she has chains of gold on her, <span
id="fr_1180"></span>[1181](#fn_1180.md) but because she has been set free
from transient lusts.  The chaste woman is greatly desired by the great
King; <span id="fr_1181"></span>[1182](#fn_1181.md) she has been wooed,
watched, and loved by Him.  The chaste woman does not furnish occasions
for being desired, except by her own husband.  The chaste woman is
grieved when she is desired by another.  The chaste woman loves her
husband from the heart, embraces, soothes, and pleases him, acts the
slave to him, and is obedient to him in all things, except when she
would be disobedient to God.  For she who obeys God is without the aid
of watchmen chaste in soul and pure in body.
