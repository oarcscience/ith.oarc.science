<span id="vi.iii.viii.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iii.viii.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.—Not Peace, But a
Sword.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.viii.iv-p2"></span>Hence, also, He who hath sent us,
when He had come, <span id="fr_776"></span>[777](#fn_776) and had seen
that all the world had fallen into wickedness, did not forthwith give
peace to him who is in error, lest He should confirm him in evil; but
set the knowledge of truth in opposition to the ruins of ignorance of
it, that, if haply men would repent and look upon the light of truth,
they might rightly grieve that they had been deceived and drawn away
into the precipices of error, and might kindle the fire of salutary
anger against the ignorance that had deceived them.  On this account,
therefore, He said, ‘I have come to send fire on the earth; and how I
wish that it were kindled!’ <span id="fr_777"></span>[778](#fn_777)  
There is therefore a certain fight, which is to be fought by us in this
life; for the word of truth and knowledge necessarily separates men from
error and ignorance, as we have often seen putrified and dead flesh in
the body separated by the cutting knife from its connection with the
living members.  Such is the effect produced by knowledge of the truth. 
For it is necessary that, for the sake of salvation, the son, for
example, who has received the word of truth, be separated from his
unbelieving parents; or again, that the father be separated from his
son, or the daughter from her mother.  And in this manner the battle of
knowledge and ignorance, of truth and error, arises between believing
and unbelieving kinsmen and relations.  And therefore He who has sent us
said again, ‘I am not come to send peace on earth, but a sword.’ <span
