<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.iii.xii-p2"></A>&#8220;Moreover let the deacons of the church, going about with intelligence, be as eyes to the bishop, carefully inquiring into the doings of each member of the church, <i>ascertaining</i> who is about to sin, in order that, being arrested with admonition by the president, he may haply not accomplish the sin.&#160; Let them check the disorderly, that they may not desist from assembling to hear the discourses, so that they may be able to counteract by the word of truth those anxieties that fall upon the heart from every side, by means of worldly casualties and evil communications; for if they long remain fallow, they become fuel for the fire.&#160; And let them learn who are suffering under bodily disease, and let them bring them to the notice of the multitude who do not know of them, that they may visit them, and supply their wants according to the judgment of the president.&#160; Yea, though they do this without his knowledge, they do nothing amiss.&#160; These things, then, and things like to these, let the deacons attend to.</p>
