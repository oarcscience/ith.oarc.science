<span id="vi.iii.iv.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iii.iv.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIV.—Simon Magus, Professes to Be
God.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iv.xiv-p2"></span>“At those sayings of his Simon grew
pale; but after a little, recollecting himself, he thus answered:  ‘Do
not think that I am a man of your race.  I am neither magician, nor
lover <span id="page_101">p. 101</span> <span
id="vi.iii.iv.xiv-Page_101"></span>of Luna, nor son of Antonius.  For
before my mother Rachel and he came together, she, still a virgin,
conceived me, while it was in my power to be either small or great, and
to appear as a man among men. <span id="fr_609"></span>[610](#fn_609)  
Therefore I have chosen you first as my friends, for the purpose of
trying you, that I may place you first in my heavenly and unspeakable
places when I shall have proved you.  Therefore I have pretended to be a
man, that I might more clearly ascertain if you cherish entire affection
towards me.’  But when I heard that, judging him indeed to be a wretch,
yet wondering at his impudence; and blushing for him, and at the same
time fearing lest he should attempt some evil against us, I beckoned to
Niceta to feign for a little along with me, and said to him:  ‘Be not
angry with us, corruptible men, O thou incorruptible God, but rather
accept our affection, and our mind willing to know who God is; for we
did not till now know who thou art, nor did we perceive that thou art he
whom we were seeking.’”
