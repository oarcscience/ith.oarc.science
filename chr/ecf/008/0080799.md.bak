<span id="vi.iv.viii.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.viii.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII.—Jupiter’s Amours.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.viii.xii-p2"></span>“‘And not to spend the time to no
purpose in giving more examples, I shall begin with mentioning some
embraces of Zeus himself, the father of gods and men. <span
id="fr_1048"></span>[1049](#fn_1048.md)   For it is impossible to mention
all, on account of their multitude.  Hear, therefore, the amours of this
great Jupiter, which he concealed by changing his form, on account of
the fanaticism of senseless men.  For, in the first place, wishing to
show to wise men that adultery is no sin, when he was going to marry,
being, according to the multitude, knowingly an adulterer, in his first
marriage, but not being so in reality, by means, as I said, of a seeming
sin be accomplished a sinless marriage. <span
id="fr_1049"></span>[1050](#fn_1049.md)   For he married his own sister
Hera, assuming the likeness of a cuckoo’s wing; and of her were born
Hebe and Ilithyia.  For he gave birth to Metis without copulation with
any one, as did also Hera to Vulcan.

general meaning; but the text is hopelessly corrupt.
