Peter.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iii.lxxiv-p2"></span>“When Zacchæus had heard these
things, he told me in return of the doings of Simon; and in the meantime
Simon himself—how he heard of my arrival I do not know—sent a message to
me, saying, ‘Let us dispute to-morrow in the hearing of the people.’  To
which I answered, ‘Be it so, as it pleaseth you.’  And this promise of
mine was known over the whole city, so that even you, who arrived on
that very day, learned that I was to hold a discussion with Simon on the
following day, and having found out my abode, according to the
directions which you had received from Barnabas, came to me.  But I so
rejoiced at your coming, that my mind, moved I know not how, hastened to
expound all things quickly to you, yet especially that which is the main
point in our faith, concerning the true Prophet, which alone, I doubt
not, is a sufficient foundation for the whole of our doctrine.  Then, in
the next place, I unfolded to you the more secret meaning of the written
law, through its several heads, which there was occasion to unfold;
neither did I conceal from you the good things of the traditions.  But
what remains, beginning from tomorrow, you shall hear from day to day in
connection with the questions which will be raised in the discussion
with Simon, <span id="page_97">p. 97</span> <span
id="vi.iii.iii.lxxiv-Page_97"></span>until by God’s favour we reach that
city of Rome to which we believe that our journey is to be directed.”

<span id="vi.iii.iii.lxxiv-p3"></span>I then declared that I owed him
all thanks for what he had told me, and promised that I would most
readily do all that he commanded.  Then, having taken food, he ordered
me to rest, and he also betook himself to rest.”
