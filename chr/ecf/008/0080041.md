<span id="v.iv.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II.—His Behaviour in Places Where There
Were Christians of Both Sexes.</span>

<span id="v.iv.ii-p2"></span>And if, moreover, it chance that we are
distant from our homes and from our neighbours, and the day decline and
the eventide overtake us, and the brethren press us, through love of the
brotherhood and by reason of their affection for strangers, to stay with
them, so that we may watch with them, and they may hear the holy word of
God and do *it*, and be fed with the words of the Lord, so that they may
be mindful of them, and they set before us bread and water and that
which God provides, and we be willing and consent to stay through the
night with them; if there be there a holy man, <span
id="fr_438"></span>[439](#fn_438.md) with him we turn in and lodge, and
that same brother will provide and prepare whatever is necessary for us;
and he himself waits upon us, and he himself washes our feet for us and
anoints us with ointment, and he himself gets ready a bed for us, that
we may sleep in reliance on God.  All these things will that consecrated
brother, who is in the place in which we tarry, do in his own person. 
He will himself serve the brethren, and each one of the brethren who are
in the same place will join with him in rendering all those
services <span id="fr_439"></span>[440](#fn_439.md) which are requisite for
the brethren.  But with us may no female, whether young maiden or
married woman, be there at that time; <span
id="fr_440"></span>[441](#fn_440.md) nor she that is aged, <span
id="fr_441"></span>[442](#fn_441.md) nor she that has taken the vow; not
even a maid-servant, whether Christian or heathen; but there shall only
be men with men.  And, if we see it to be requisite to stand and pray
for the sake of the women, and to speak words of exhortation and
edification, we call *together* the brethren and all the holy sisters
and maidens, *and* likewise all the other women who are there, *inviting
them* with all modesty and becoming behaviour to come and feast on the
truth. <span id="fr_442"></span>[443](#fn_442.md)   And those among us who
are skilled in speaking speak to them, and exhort them in those words
which God has given us.  And then we pray, and salute <span
id="fr_443"></span>[444](#fn_443.md) one another, the men the men.  But the
women and the maidens will wrap their hands in their garments; *and* we
also, with circumspection and with all purity, our eyes looking upwards,
shall wrap our right hand in our garments; and then they will come and
give us the salutation on our right hand wrapped in our garments.  Then
we go where God permits us.
