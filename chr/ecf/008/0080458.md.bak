id="vi.iii.x.lii-p1.1"></span>Chapter LII.—“No Rose Without Its
Thorn.”</span>

<span id="vi.iii.x.lii-p2"></span>“Observe therefore in this, as I have
said, how justly divine providence comes to the help of things vitiated;
that, inasmuch as evils which had derived their origin from sin were
associated with the good things of God, He should assign two chiefs to
these two departments. <span id="fr_824"></span>[825](#fn_824.md)   And
*accordingly*, to Him who rejoices in good He has appointed the ordering
of good things, that He might bring those who believe *in Him* to the
faith of His providence; but to him who rejoices in evil, He has given
over those things which are done without order and uselessly, from which
of course the faith of His providence comes into doubt; and thus a just
division has been made by a just God.  Hence therefore it is, that
whereas the orderly course of the stars produces faith that the world
was made by the hand of a designer, on the other hand, the disturbance
of the air, the pestilent breeze, the uncontrolled fire of the
lightning, cast doubt upon the work of providence.  For, as we have
said, every good thing has its corresponding contrary evil thing joined
with it; as hail is opposite to the fertilizing showers, the corruption
of mildew is associated with the gentle dew, the whirlwinds of storms
are joined with the soft winds, unfruitful trees with fruitful, noxious
herbs with useful, wild and destructive animals with gentle ones.  But
all these things are arranged by God, because that the choice of men’s
will has departed from the purpose of good, and fallen away to evil.
