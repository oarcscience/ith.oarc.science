<span id="vii.v.xlii-p2"></span>And they went away from Capernaum into
the city which is called Bethlehem; and Joseph lived with Mary in his
own house, and Jesus with them.  And on a certain day Joseph called to
him his first-born son James, <span id="fr_1687"></span>[1688](#fn_1687.md)
and sent him into the vegetable garden to gather vegetables for the
purpose of making broth.  And Jesus followed His brother James into the
garden; but Joseph and Mary did not know this.  And while James was
collecting the vegetables, a viper suddenly came out of a hole and
struck his hand, <span id="fr_1688"></span>[1689](#fn_1688.md) and he began
to cry out from excessive pain.  And, becoming exhausted, he said, with
a bitter cry:  Alas! alas! an accursed viper has struck my hand.  And
Jesus, who was standing opposite to him, at the bitter cry ran up to
James, and took hold of his hand; and all that He did was to blow on the
hand of James, and cool it:  and immediately James was healed, and the
serpent died.  And Joseph and Mary did not know what had been done; but
at the cry of James, and the command of Jesus, they ran to the garden,
and found the serpent already dead, and James quite cured.
