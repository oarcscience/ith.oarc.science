God.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.vi.xlvi-p2"></span>“Thus the sayings accusatory of the
God who made the heaven are both rendered void by the opposite sayings
which are alongside of them, and are refuted by the creation.  For they
were not written by a prophetic hand.  Wherefore also they appear
opposite to the hand of God, who made all things.”  Then said Simon: 
“How can you show this?”
