<span id="vi.iv.xv.xii-p2"></span>When Peter had spoken thus, a certain
one amongst us ventured to invite him, in the name of all, that next
day, early in the morning, he should sail to Aradus, an island opposite,
distant, I suppose, not quite thirty stadia, for the purpose of seeing
two pillars of vine-wood that were there, and that were of very great
girth.  Therefore the indulgent Peter consented, saying, “When you leave
the boat, do not go many of you together to see the things that you
desire to see; for I do not wish that the attention of the inhabitants
should be turned to you.”  And so we sailed, and in short time arrived
at the island.  Then landing from the boat, we went to the place where
the vine-wood pillars were, and along with them we looked at several of
the works of Phidias.
