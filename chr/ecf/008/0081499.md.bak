<span id="x.v.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="x.v.ii-p1.1"></span>I.</span>

<span id="x.v.ii-p2"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="x.v.ii-p2.1"></span>A Discourse Which Was in the Presence of
Antoninus Cæsar, and He Exhorted <span
id="fr_3547"></span>[3548](#fn_3547.md) The Said Cæsar to Acquaint Himself
with God, and Showed to Him the Way of Truth.</span>

<span id="x.v.ii-p4"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="x.v.ii-p4.1"></span>He</span> began to speak as follows:—

<span id="x.v.ii-p5"></span>“It is not easy,” said Melito, “speedily to
bring into the right way the man who has a long time previously been
held fast by error.  It may, however, be effected:  for, when a man
turns away ever so little from error, the mention of the truth is
acceptable to him.  For, just as when the cloud breaks ever so little
there comes fair weather, even so, when a man turns toward God, the
thick cloud of error which deprived him of true vision is quickly
withdrawn from before him.  For error, like disease <span
id="fr_3548"></span>[3549](#fn_3548.md) and sleep, long holds fast those
who come under its influence; <span id="fr_3549"></span>[3550](#fn_3549.md)
but truth uses the word as a goad, and smites the slumberers, and
awakens them; and when they are awake they look at the truth, and also
understand it:  they hear, and distinguish that which is from that which
is not.  For there are men who call iniquity righteousness:  they think,
for example, that it is righteousness for a man to err with the many. 
But I, for my part, affirm that it is not a good excuse *for error* that
a man errs with the many.  For, if one man only sin, <span
id="fr_3550"></span>[3551](#fn_3550.md) his sin is great:  how much greater
will be the sin when many sin *together!*

<span id="x.v.ii-p9"></span>“Now, the sin of which I speak is this: 
when a man abandons that which really exists, and serves that which does
not really exist.  There ‘is’ that which really exists, and it is called
<span class="c9"><span id="x.v.ii-p9.1"></span>God</span>.  He, *I say*,
really exists, and by His power doth everything subsist.  This being is
in no sense made, nor did He ever come into being; but He has existed
from eternity, and will *continue to* exist for ever and ever.  He
changeth not, while everything *else* changes.  No eye <span
id="fr_3551"></span>[3552](#fn_3551.md) can see Him, nor thought apprehend
Him, nor language describe Him; and those who love Him speak of Him
thus:  ‘Father, and God of Truth.’

<span id="x.v.ii-p11"></span>“If, therefore, a man forsake the light,
and say that there is another God, it is plain from what he himself says
that it is some created thing which he calls God.  For, if a man call
fire God, it is not God, because it is fire; and, if a man call water
God, it is not God, because it is water; and, if *he so call* this earth
on which we tread, or these heavens which are seen by us, or the sun, or
the moon, or some one of these stars which run their course without
ceasing by *Divine* command, and do not speed along by their own will,
*neither are these gods;* and, if a man call gold and silver gods, are
not these objects things which we use as we please? and, if *he so call*
those pieces of wood which we burn, or those stones which we break, how
can these things be gods?  For, lo! they are *for* the use of man.  How
can ‘they’ escape the commission of great sin, who in their speech
change the great God into those things which, so long as they continue,
continue by *Divine* command?

<span id="x.v.ii-p12"></span>“But, notwithstanding this, I say that so
long as a man does not hear, and *so* does not discern or understand
that there is a Lord over these creatures, he is not perhaps to be
blamed:  because no one finds fault with a blind man though he walk ever
so badly.  For, in the same manner *as the blind, so* men also, when
they were seeking after God, stumbled upon stones and blocks of wood;
and such of them as were rich stumbled upon gold and silver, and were
prevented by their stumblings from *finding* that which they were
seeking after.  But, now that a voice has been heard through all the
earth, <span id="fr_3552"></span>[3553](#fn_3552.md) *declaring* that there
is a God of truth, and there has been given to every man an eye
wherewith to see, those persons are without excuse who are ashamed of
*incurring the censure of* their former companions in error, and yet
desire to walk in the right way.  For those who are ashamed to be saved
must of necessity perish.  I therefore counsel them to open their eyes
and see:  for, lo! light is given abundantly <span
id="fr_3553"></span>[3554](#fn_3553.md) to us all to see thereby; and if,
when light has arisen upon us, <span id="page_752">p. 752</span> <span
id="x.v.ii-Page_752"></span>any one close his eyes so as not to see,
into the ditch he must go. <span id="fr_3554"></span>[3555](#fn_3554.md)  
But why is a man ashamed of *the censure of* those who have been in
error along with himself?  Rather does it behove him to persuade them to
follow in his steps; and, if they should not be persuaded by him, *then*
to disengage himself from their society.  For there are some men who are
unable to rise from their mother earth, and therefore also do they make
them gods from the earth their mother; and they are condemned by the
judgments of truth, forasmuch as they apply the name *of Him* who is
unchangeable to those objects which are subject to change, and shrink
not from calling those things gods which have been made by the hands of
man, and dare to make an image of God whom they have not seen.

<span id="x.v.ii-p16"></span>“But I *have to* remark further, that the
Sibyl <span id="fr_3555"></span>[3556](#fn_3555.md) also has said
concerning them that it is the images of deceased kings that they
worship.  And this is easy to understand:  for, lo! even now they
worship and honour the images of those of Cæsarean rank <span
id="fr_3556"></span>[3557](#fn_3556.md) more than their former *gods*; for
from those their former gods both *pecuniary* tribute and produce accrue
to Cæsar, as to one who is greater than they.  On this account, those
who despise them, and *so* cause Cæsar’s revenue to fall short, are put
to death.  But to the treasury of other kings also it is appointed how
much the worshippers in various places shall pay, and how many
vesselfuls <span id="fr_3557"></span>[3558](#fn_3557.md) of water from the
sea they shall supply.  Such is the wickedness of the world—of those who
worship and fear that which has no sensation.  Many of them, too, who
are crafty, either for the sake of gain, or for vainglory, or for
dominion over the multitude, both themselves worship, and incite those
who are destitute of understanding to worship, that which has no
sensation.

<span id="x.v.ii-p24"></span>“I will further write and show, as far as
my ability goes, how and for what causes images were made to kings and
tyrants, and *how* they came to be regarded <span
id="fr_3558"></span>[3559](#fn_3558.md) as gods.  The people of Argos made
images to Hercules, because he belonged to their city, and was strong,
and by his valour slew noxious beasts, and more especially because they
were afraid of him.  For he was subject to no control, and carried off
the wives of many:  for his lust was great, like that of Zuradi the
Persian, his friend.  Again, the people of Acte worshipped
Dionysus, <span id="fr_3559"></span>[3560](#fn_3559.md) a king, because he
had recently <span id="fr_3560"></span>[3561](#fn_3560.md) planted the vine
in their country.  The Egyptians worshipped Joseph the Hebrew, who was
called Serapis, because he supplied them with corn during the years of
famine.  The Athenians worshipped Athene, the daughter of Zeus, king of
the island of Crete, because she built the town of Athens, and made
Ericthippus her son king there, whom she had by adultery with Hephæstus,
a blacksmith, son of a wife of her father.  She was, too, always
courting the society of Hercules, because he was her brother on her
father’s side.  For Zeus the king became enamoured of Alcmene, the wife
of Electryon, who was from Argos, and committed adultery with her, and
she gave birth to Hercules.  The people of Phœnicia worshipped
Balthi, <span id="fr_3561"></span>[3562](#fn_3561.md) queen of Cyprus,
because she fell in love with Tamuz, son of Cuthar king of the
Phœnicians, and left her own kingdom and came and dwelt in Gebal, a
fortress of the Phœnicians, and at the same time made all the Cyprians
subject to King Cuthar.  Also, before Tamuz she had fallen in love with
Ares, and committed adultery with him; and Hephæstus, her husband,
caught her, and his jealousy was roused against her, and he came and
killed Tamuz in Mount Lebanon, as he was hunting <span
id="fr_3562"></span>[3563](#fn_3562.md) wild boars; and from that time
Balthi remained in Gebal, and she died in the city of Aphiki, <span
id="fr_3563"></span>[3564](#fn_3563.md) where Tamuz was buried.  The
Elamites worshipped Nuh, daughter of the king of Elam:  when the enemy
had carried her captive, her father made for her an image and a temple
in Shushan, a royal residence which is in Elam.  The Syrians worshipped
Athi, a Hadibite, who sent the daughter of Belat, a person skilled in
medicine, and she healed Simi, the daughter of Hadad king of Syria; and
some time afterwards, when Hadad himself had the leprosy upon him, Athi
entreated Elisha the Hebrew, and he came and healed him of his leprosy. 
The people of Mesopotamia also worshipped Cuthbi, a Hebrew woman,
because she delivered Bakru, the paternal *king* <span
id="fr_3564"></span>[3565](#fn_3564.md) of Edessa, from his enemies.  With
respect to Nebo, who is *worshipped* in Mabug, why should I write to
you?  For, lo! all the priests who are in Mabug know that it is the
image of Orpheus, a Thracian <span id="page_753">p. 753</span> <span
id="x.v.ii-Page_753"></span>Magus.  Hadran, again, is the image of
Zaradusht, a Persian Magus.  For both of these Magi practised magic at a
well which was in a wood in Mabug, in which was an unclean spirit, and
it assaulted and disputed the passage of every one who passed by in all
that country in which the town of Mabug is situated; and these Magi, in
accordance with what was a mystery in their Magian system, bade Simi,
the daughter of Hadad, to draw water from the sea and pour it into the
well, so that the spirit should not come up and commit assault.  In like
manner, the rest of mankind made images to their kings and worshipped
them; of which matter I will not write further.

<span id="x.v.ii-p32"></span>“But thou, a *person of* liberal mind, and
familiar with the truth, if thou wilt *properly* consider these matters,
commune with thine own self; <span id="fr_3565"></span>[3566](#fn_3565.md)
and, though they should clothe thee in the garb of a woman, remember
that thou art a man.  Believe in Him who is in reality God, and to Him
lay open thy mind, and to Him commit thy soul, and He is able to give
thee immortal life for ever, for everything is possible to Him; <span
id="fr_3566"></span>[3567](#fn_3566.md) and let all other things be
esteemed by thee just as they are—images as images, and sculptures as
sculptures; and let not that which is only made be put by thee in the
place of Him who is not made, but let Him, the ever-living God, be
constantly present to thy mind. <span
id="fr_3567"></span>[3568](#fn_3567.md)   For thy mind itself is His
likeness:  for it too is invisible and impalpable, <span
id="fr_3568"></span>[3569](#fn_3568.md) and not to be represented by any
form, yet by its will is the whole bodily frame moved.  Know, therefore,
that, if thou constantly serve Him who is immoveable, even He exists for
ever, so thou also, when thou shalt have put off this *body*, which is
visible and corruptible, shall stand before Him for ever, endowed with
life and knowledge, and thy works shall be to thee wealth inexhaustible
and possessions unfailing.  And know that the chief of thy good works is
this:  that thou know God, and serve Him.  Know, too, that He asketh not
anything of thee:  He needeth not anything.

<span id="x.v.ii-p37"></span>“Who is this God?  He who is Himself truth,
and His word truth.  And what is truth?  That which is not fashioned,
nor made, nor represented by art:  that is, which has never been brought
into existence, and is *on that account* called truth. <span
id="fr_3569"></span>[3570](#fn_3569.md)   If, therefore, a man worship that
which is made with hands, it is not the truth that he worships, nor yet
the word of truth.

<span id="x.v.ii-p39"></span>“I have very much to say on this subject;
but I feel ashamed for those who do not understand that they are
superior to the work of their own hands, nor perceive how they give gold
to the artists that they may make for them gods, and give them silver
for their adornment and honour, and move their riches about from place
to place, and *then* worship them.  And what infamy can be greater than
this, that a man should worship his riches, and forsake Him who bestowed
those riches upon him? and that he should revile man, yet worship the
image of man; and slay a beast, yet worship the likeness of a beast? 
This also is evident, that it is the workmanship of their fellowmen that
they worship:  for they do not worship the treasures <span
id="fr_3570"></span>[3571](#fn_3570.md) while they are laid by in the bag,
but when the artists have fashioned images out of them they worship
them; neither do they worship the gold or the silver considered as
property, <span id="fr_3571"></span>[3572](#fn_3571.md) but when the
gravers have sculptured them then they worship them.  Senseless man!
what addition has been made to thy gold, that now thou worshippest it? 
If it is because it has been made to resemble a winged animal, why dost
thou not worship the winged animal *itself?*  And if because it has been
made like a beast of prey, lo! the beast of prey itself is before thee. 
And if it is the workmanship itself that pleases thee, let the
workmanship of God please thee, who made all things, and in His own
likeness made the workmen, who strive to do like Him, but resemble Him
not.

<span id="x.v.ii-p42"></span>“But perhaps thou wilt say:  How is it that
God did not so make me that I should serve Him, and not images?  In
speaking thus, thou art seeking to become an idle instrument, and not a
living man.  For God made thee as perfect as it seemed good to Him.  He
has given thee a mind endowed with freedom; He has set <span
id="page_754">p. 754</span> <span id="x.v.ii-Page_754"></span>before
thee objects in great number, that thou on thy part mayest distinguish
*the nature of* each thing and choose for thyself that which is good; He
has set before thee the heavens, and placed in them the stars; He has
set before thee the sun and the moon, and they too every day run their
course therein; He has set before thee the multitude of waters, and
restrained them by His word; He has set before thee the wide earth,
which remains at rest, and continues before thee without
variation: <span id="fr_3572"></span>[3573](#fn_3572.md)   yet, lest thou
shouldst suppose that of its own nature it *so* continues, He makes it
also to quake when He pleaseth; He has set before thee the clouds, which
by *His* command bring water from above and satisfy the earth—that from
hence thou mayest understand that He who puts these things in motion is
superior to them all, and mayest accept *thankfully* the goodness of Him
who has given thee a mind whereby to distinguish these things from one
another.

<span id="x.v.ii-p44"></span>“Wherefore I counsel thee to know thyself,
and to know God.  For understand how that there is within thee that
which is called the soul—by it the eye seeth, by it the ear heareth, by
it the mouth speaketh; and how it makes use of the whole body; and
*how*, whenever He pleaseth to remove the soul from the body, this
falleth *to decay* and perisheth.  From this, therefore, which exists
within thyself and is invisible, understand how God also moveth the
whole by His power, like the body; *and* that, whenever it pleases Him
to withdraw His power, the whole world also, like the body, will fall
*to decay* and perish.

<span id="x.v.ii-p45"></span>“But why this world was made, and why it
passes away, and why the body exists, and why it falls *to decay*, and
why it continues, thou canst not know until thou hast raised thy head
from this sleep in which thou art sunk, and hast opened thine eyes and
seen that God is One, the Lord of all, and hast come to serve Him with
all thy heart.  Then will He grant thee to know His will:  for every one
that is severed from the knowledge of the living God is dead and buried
*even while* in his body.  Therefore *is it that* thou dost wallow on
the ground before demons and shadows, and askest vain petitions from
that which has not anything to give.  But thou, stand thou up from among
those who are lying on the earth and caressing stones, and giving their
substance as food for the fire, and offering their raiment to idols,
and, while *themselves* possessed of senses, are bent on serving that
which has no sensation; and offer thou for thy imperishable soul
petitions *for that* which decayeth not, to God who suffers no decay—and
thy freedom will be at once apparent; and be thou careful of it, <span
id="fr_3573"></span>[3574](#fn_3573.md) and give thanks to God who made
thee, and gave thee the mind of the free, that thou mightest shape thy
conduct even as thou wilt.  He hath set before thee all these things,
and showeth thee that, if thou follow after evil, thou shalt be
condemned for thy evil deeds; but that, if after goodness, thou shalt
receive from Him abundant good, <span
id="fr_3574"></span>[3575](#fn_3574.md) together with immortal life for
ever.

<span id="x.v.ii-p48"></span>“There is, therefore, nothing to hinder
thee from changing thy evil manner of life, because thou art a free man;
or from seeking and finding out who is the Lord of all; or from serving
Him with all thy heart:  because with Him there is no reluctance to give
the knowledge of Himself to those that seek it, according to the measure
of their capacity to know Him.

<span id="x.v.ii-p49"></span>“Let it be thy first care not to deceive
thyself.  For, if thou sayest of that which is not God:  This is God,
thou deceivest thyself, and sinnest before the God of truth.  Thou fool!
is that God which is *bought and* sold?  Is that God which is in want? 
Is that God which must be watched over?  How buyest thou him as a slave,
and servest him as a master?  How askest thou of him, as of one that is
rich, to give to thee, and thyself givest to him as to one that is
poor?  How dost thou expect of him that he will make thee victorious in
battle? for, lo! when thy enemies have conquered thee, they strip him
likewise.

<span id="x.v.ii-p50"></span>“Perhaps one who is a king may say:  I
cannot behave myself aright, because I am a king; it becomes me to do
the will of the many.  He who speaks thus really deserves to be laughed
at:  for why should not the king himself lead the way <span
id="fr_3575"></span>[3576](#fn_3575.md) to all good things, and persuade
the people under his rule to behave with purity, and to know God in
truth, and in his own person set before them the patterns of all things
excellent—since thus it becomes him to do?  For it is a shameful thing
that a king, however badly he may conduct himself, should *yet* judge
and condemn those who do amiss.

<span id="x.v.ii-p52"></span>“My opinion is this:  that in ‘this’ way a
kingdom may be governed in peace—when the sovereign is acquainted with
the God of truth, and is withheld by fear of Him from doing wrong <span
id="fr_3576"></span>[3577](#fn_3576.md) to those who are his subjects, and
judges everything with equity, as one who knows that he himself also
will be judged before God; while, at the same time, those who are under
his rule <span id="fr_3577"></span>[3578](#fn_3577.md) are withheld by the
fear of God from doing wrong to their sovereign, and are restrained by
*the same* fear from doing wrong to one another.  <span id="page_755">p.
755</span> <span id="x.v.ii-Page_755"></span>By this knowledge of God
and fear of Him all evil may be removed from the realm.  For, if the
sovereign abstain from doing wrong to those who are under his rule, and
they abstain from doing wrong to him and to each other, it is evident
that the whole country will dwell in peace.  Many blessings, too, will
be *enjoyed* there, because amongst them all the name of God will be
glorified.  For what blessing is greater than this, that a sovereign
should deliver the people that are under his rule from error, and by
this good deed render himself pleasing to God?  For from error arise all
those evils *from which kingdoms suffer;* but the greatest of all errors
is this:  when a man is ignorant of God, and in God’s stead worships
that which is not God.

<span id="x.v.ii-p55"></span>“There are, however, persons who say:  It
is for the honour of God that we make the image:  in order, that is,
that we may worship the God who is concealed from our view.  But they
are unaware that God is in every country, and in every place, and is
never absent, and that there is not anything done and He knoweth it
not.  Yet thou, despicable man! within whom He is, and without whom He
is, and above whom He is, hast nevertheless gone and bought thee wood
from the carpenter’s, and it is carved and made into an image insulting
to God. <span id="fr_3578"></span>[3579](#fn_3578.md)   To this thou
offerest sacrifice, and knowest not that the all-seeing eye seeth thee,
and that the word of truth reproves thee, and says to thee:  How can the
unseen God be sculptured?  Nay, it is the likeness of thyself that thou
makest and worshippest.  Because the wood has been sculptured, hast thou
not the insight to perceive that it is *still* wood, or *that the stone*
is *still* stone?  The gold also the workman <span
id="fr_3579"></span>[3580](#fn_3579.md) taketh according to its weight in
the balance.  And when thou hast had it made <span
id="fr_3580"></span>[3581](#fn_3580.md) *into an image*, why dost thou
weigh it?  Therefore thou art a lover of gold, and not a lover of God. 
And art thou not ashamed, perchance it be deficient, to demand of the
maker of it why he has stolen some of it?  Though thou hast eyes, dose
thou not see?  And though thou hast intelligence, <span
id="fr_3581"></span>[3582](#fn_3581.md) dose thou not understand?  Why dost
thou wallow on the ground, and offer supplication to things which are
without sense?  Fear Him who shaketh the earth, and maketh the heavens
to revolve, and smiteth the sea, and removeth the mountain from its
place—Him who can make Himself like a fire, and consume all things; and,
if thou be not able to clear thyself of guilt, yet add not to thy sins;
and, if thou be not able to know God, yet doubt not <span
id="fr_3582"></span>[3583](#fn_3582.md) that He exists.

<span id="x.v.ii-p61"></span>“Again, there are persons who say: 
Whatsoever our fathers have bequeathed to us, *that* we reverence. 
Therefore, of course, it is, that those whose fathers have bequeathed
them poverty strive to become rich! and those whose fathers did not
instruct them, desire to be instructed, and to learn that which their
fathers knew not!  And why, forsooth, do the children of the blind see,
and the children of the lame walk?  Nay, it is not well for a man to
follow *his* predecessors, *if they be* those whose course was evil; but
*rather* that we should turn from that path of theirs, lest that which
befell *our* predecessors should bring disaster upon us also. 
Wherefore, inquire whether thy father’s course was good:  and, *if so*,
do thou also follow in his steps; but, if thy father’s course was very
evil, let thine be good, and so let it be with thy children after
thee. <span id="fr_3583"></span>[3584](#fn_3583.md)   Be grieved also for
thy father because his course is evil, so long as thy grief may avail to
help him.  But, as for thy children, speak to them thus:  There is a
God, the Father of all, who never came into being, neither was ever
made, and by whose will all things subsist.  He also made the
luminaries, that His works may see one another; and He conceals Himself
in His power from all His works:  for it is not permitted to any being
subject to change to see Him who changes not.  But such as are mindful
*of His words*, and are admitted into that covenant which is
unchangeable, ‘they’ see God—so far as it is possible for them to see
Him.  These also will have power to escape destruction, when the flood
of fire comes upon all the world.  For there was once a flood and a
wind, <span id="fr_3584"></span>[3585](#fn_3584.md) and the great <span
id="fr_3585"></span>[3586](#fn_3585.md) men were swept away by a violent
blast from the north, but the just were left, for a demonstration of the
truth.  Again, at another time there was a flood of water, and all men
and animals perished in the multitude of waters, but the just were
preserved in an ark of wood by the command of God.  So also will it be
at the last time:  there shall be a flood of fire, and the earth shall
be burnt up, together with its moun<span id="page_756">p. 756</span>
<span id="x.v.ii-Page_756"></span>tains; and mankind shall be burnt up,
along with the idols which they have made, and the carved images which
they have worshipped; and the sea shall be burnt up, together with its
islands; but the just shall be preserved from wrath, like as *were*
their fellows of the ark from the waters of the deluge.  And then shall
those who have not known God, and those who have made them idols, bemoan
themselves, when they shall see those idols of theirs being burnt up,
together with themselves, and nothing shall be found to help them.

<span id="x.v.ii-p70"></span>“When thou, Antoninus <span
id="fr_3586"></span>[3587](#fn_3586.md) Cæsar, shall become acquainted with
these things, and thy children also with thee, *then* wilt thou bequeath
to them an inheritance for ever which fadeth not away, and thou wilt
deliver thy soul, and the souls of thy children also, from that which
shall come upon the whole earth in the judgment of truth *and* of
righteousness.  For, according as thou hast acknowledged Him here, *so*
will He acknowledge thee there; and, if thou account Him here

<span id="x.v.ii-p3"></span> “Which was *delivered* in the presence…and
*in which* etc.”  This appears to be the sense intended, and is that
given by M. Renan:  “Sermo qui factus est.”  Cureton renders, “Who was
in the presence, etc.,” and supposes that Melito first saw and conversed
with the emperor, and afterwards wrote this discourse.  Melito speaks of
it more than once as written.  This view, however, does not dispose of
that fact that Melito is here affirmed to have “exhorted (lit., *said
to*) Cæsar, etc.”  It was clearly meant to be understood that the
discourse, or *speech*, was spoken:  the references to writing merely
show that it was written, either before or after the delivery.

Oracles*:—

<span id="x.v.ii-p18"></span>“But we have strayed from the Immortal’s
ways,

<span id="x.v.ii-p19"></span>And worship with a dull and senseless mind

<span id="x.v.ii-p20"></span>Idols, the workmanship of our own hands,

id="x.v.ii-p22.1"></span>

<span id="x.v.ii-p23"></span> Cureton:  “sacks full.”  The first word is
used of a leathern pouch or wallet, as in [Luke x.

id="x.v.ii-p28.1"></span>

<span id="x.v.ii-p29"></span> Cureton’s conjecture of \*\*\* or \*\*\*
for \*\*\* has been adopted.

<span id="fn_3563"></span>[752:3564](0081499.htm#fr_3563.md) <span
id="x.v.ii-p29.1"></span>

<span id="x.v.ii-p30"></span> Some have identified it with Aphek, [Josh.
xix. 30](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#030.md)<span
id="x.v.ii-p30.1"></span>.  The rites observed here were specially
abominable.

<span id="fn_3564"></span>[752:3565](0081499.htm#fr_3564.md) <span
id="x.v.ii-p30.2"></span>

<span id="x.v.ii-p31"></span> Cureton:  “the patrician.”  Dr. Payne
Smith, *Thes. Syr. s.v*., regards the word as equivalent to <span
class="Greek"><span id="x.v.ii-p31.1"></span>πατὴρ τῆς πόλεως</span>,
*pater civitatis*, “a title of honour found in the Byzantine writers,”
and is inclined to think it a term belonging to the dialect of Edessa. 
A similar use of the same adjective is quoted from Buxtorf, *Lex. Chald.
Talm*., p. 12:  “<span class="Hebrew"><span
id="x.v.ii-p31.2"></span>ייבַּאַ</span> cognomen R. Nachmanis, qui a
celebritate familiæ sic cognominatus est, quasi *Patritius*.”  This view
appears to be supported by the similar use of an adjective for a
substantive above:  “*persons* of Cæsarean rank,” or “Cæsars.”

<span id="fn_3565"></span>[753:3566](0081499.htm#fr_3565.md) <span
id="x.v.ii-p32.1"></span>

<span id="x.v.ii-p33"></span> Lit., “be (or, get to be) with thyself.” 
Cureton:  “enter into thyself.”  The meaning appears to be, “think for
thyself.”

<span id="fn_3566"></span>[753:3567](0081499.htm#fr_3566.md) <span
id="x.v.ii-p33.1"></span>

<span id="x.v.ii-p34"></span> Cureton:  “Everything cometh through His
hands.”  It should rather be, “*into* His hands,” i.e., “He has power to
do everything.”  See note 7, p. 725.

<span id="fn_3567"></span>[753:3568](0081499.htm#fr_3567.md) <span
id="x.v.ii-p34.1"></span>

<span id="x.v.ii-p35"></span> Lit., “be running in thy mind.”

<span id="fn_3568"></span>[753:3569](0081499.htm#fr_3568.md) <span
id="x.v.ii-p35.1"></span>

<span id="x.v.ii-p36"></span> The text has \*\*\*, which M. Renan
derives from the root \*\*\* and translates “*commovetur*.”  This,
although correct in grammar, does not suit the sense.  The grammars
recognise the form as a possible Eshtaphel of \*\*\*, “*tangere*,” but
it is not found in actual use.  Dr. Payne Smith thinks the right reading
to be \*\*\*, which gives the required sense.

<span id="fn_3569"></span>[753:3570](0081499.htm#fr_3569.md) <span
id="x.v.ii-p37.1"></span>

<span id="x.v.ii-p38"></span> Or, “that which is fixed and invariable.” 
There seems to be a reference to the derivation of \*\*\* (truth) from
\*\*\*, *firmus* (*stabilis*) *fuit*.  Cureton has strangely
mistranslated \*\*\*, by “that which, without having been brought into
existence, does exist.”  The first \*\*\* is nothing but the sign of
emphatic denial which is frequently appended to \*\*\*, and \*\*\* is
the infinitive of emphasis belonging to the second \*\*\*.

<span id="fn_3570"></span>[753:3571](0081499.htm#fr_3570.md) <span
id="x.v.ii-p39.1"></span>

<span id="x.v.ii-p40"></span> Cureton:  “materials.”  The printed text
has \*\*\* “drugs.”  The correct reading, there can hardly be a doubt,
is \*\*\*.

<span id="fn_3571"></span>[753:3572](0081499.htm#fr_3571.md) <span
id="x.v.ii-p40.1"></span>

<span id="x.v.ii-p41"></span> Lit., “the property of the gold or
silver,” if the word \*\*\* is rightly taken.  Although no such
derivative of \*\*\* is found in the lexicons, the form is possible from
the Palel of that verb:  e.g. \*\*\* from \*\*\*.  See Hoffmann, *Gram.
Syr*., sec. 87, 19.

<span id="fn_3572"></span>[754:3573](0081499.htm#fr_3572.md) <span
id="x.v.ii-p42.1"></span>

<span id="x.v.ii-p43"></span> Lit. “in one fashion.”

<span id="fn_3573"></span>[754:3574](0081499.htm#fr_3573.md) <span
id="x.v.ii-p45.1"></span>

<span id="x.v.ii-p46"></span> Or, “of what pertains to it.”

<span id="fn_3574"></span>[754:3575](0081499.htm#fr_3574.md) <span
id="x.v.ii-p46.1"></span>

<span id="x.v.ii-p47"></span> Lit. “many good things.”

<span id="fn_3575"></span>[754:3576](0081499.htm#fr_3575.md) <span
id="x.v.ii-p50.1"></span>

<span id="x.v.ii-p51"></span> Lit. “be the beginner.”

<span id="fn_3576"></span>[754:3577](0081499.htm#fr_3576.md) <span
id="x.v.ii-p52.1"></span>

<span id="x.v.ii-p53"></span> Cureton is probably right in so taking the
words, although the construction is not quite the same as in the similar
sentence a little below.  If so, for \*\*\* we must read \*\*\*.

<span id="fn_3577"></span>[754:3578](0081499.htm#fr_3577.md) <span
id="x.v.ii-p53.1"></span>

<span id="x.v.ii-p54"></span> Lit. “hand.”

<span id="fn_3578"></span>[755:3579](0081499.htm#fr_3578.md) <span
id="x.v.ii-p55.1"></span>

<span id="x.v.ii-p56"></span> Lit. “into an insult of God.”  So M.
Renan, “in opprobrium Dei.”  Cureton, admitting that this may be the
sense, renders, “an abomination of God,” and refers to the circumstance
that in Scripture an idol is frequently so spoken of.  But \*\*\* is not
used in such passages (it is either \*\*\*, or, less frequently,
\*\*\*), nor does it appear ever to have the meaning which Cureton
assigns to it.

<span id="fn_3579"></span>[755:3580](0081499.htm#fr_3579.md) <span
id="x.v.ii-p56.1"></span>

<span id="x.v.ii-p57"></span> Lit. “he.”

<span id="fn_3580"></span>[755:3581](0081499.htm#fr_3580.md) <span
id="x.v.ii-p57.1"></span>

<span id="x.v.ii-p58"></span> Lit. “hast made it.”

<span id="fn_3581"></span>[755:3582](0081499.htm#fr_3581.md) <span
id="x.v.ii-p58.1"></span>

<span id="x.v.ii-p59"></span> Lit. “heart.”

<span id="fn_3582"></span>[755:3583](0081499.htm#fr_3582.md) <span
id="x.v.ii-p59.1"></span>

<span id="x.v.ii-p60"></span> Lit. “be of opinion.”

<span id="fn_3583"></span>[755:3584](0081499.htm#fr_3583.md) <span
id="x.v.ii-p61.1"></span>

<span id="x.v.ii-p62"></span> This seems preferable to Cureton’s, “and
let thy children also follow after thee.”  Had this been the meaning,
probably the verb \*\*\* would have been used, as in the preceding
sentence, not \*\*\*.

<span id="fn_3584"></span>[755:3585](0081499.htm#fr_3584.md) <span
id="x.v.ii-p62.1"></span>

<span id="x.v.ii-p63"></span> So the Sibylline oracle, as quoted by
Cureton in the Greek:—

<span id="x.v.ii-p64"></span>“And, when he would the starry steep of
heaven

<span id="x.v.ii-p65"></span>Ascend, the Sire Immortal did his works

<span id="x.v.ii-p66"></span>With mighty blasts assail:  forthwith the
winds

<span id="x.v.ii-p67"></span>Hurled prostrate from its height the
towering pile,

<span id="x.v.ii-p68"></span>And bitter strife among the builders
roused.”

<span id="fn_3585"></span>[755:3586](0081499.htm#fr_3585.md) <span
id="x.v.ii-p68.1"></span>

<span id="x.v.ii-p69"></span> Lit. “chosen.”  The same expression,
except that the similar \*\*\* is used for \*\*\*, occurs Sap. Sol. xiv.
6, as a translation of <span class="Greek"><span
id="x.v.ii-p69.1"></span>ὑπερηφάνων γιγάντων</span>, *gigantes
superbi*.  See *Thes. Syr*., *s.v*. \*\*\*.

<span id="fn_3586"></span>[756:3587](0081499.htm#fr_3586.md) <span
id="x.v.ii-p70.1"></span>

<span id="x.v.ii-p71"></span> The <span class="c9"><span
id="x.v.ii-p71.1"></span>ms.</span> has “Antonius.”

<span id="fn_3587"></span>[756:3588](0081499.htm#fr_3587.md) <span
id="x.v.ii-p72.1"></span>

<span id="x.v.ii-p73"></span> Cureton, for the last clause, gives “as
thou wilt,” remarking that the sense is obscure.  The literal rendering
is, “if thou wilt,” the consequent clause being unexpressed.  “If you
please, accept them,” seems what is meant.
