<span id="vi.iii.ix.xxii-p2"></span>Then Peter, holding her hand, led
her to the ship.  And when I saw him giving his hand to the woman, I
began to laugh; yet, approaching to do him honour, I tried to substitute
my hand for his, and to support the woman.  But as soon as I touched her
hand, she uttered a loud scream, and rushed into my embrace, and began
to devour me with a mother’s kisses.  But I, being ignorant of the whole
matter, pushed her off as a mad woman; and at the same time, though with
reverence, I was somewhat angry with Peter.
