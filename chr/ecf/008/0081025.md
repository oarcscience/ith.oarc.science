id="vi.iv.xvi.xx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XX.—Peter Addresses
Mattidia.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xvi.xx-p2"></span>While Peter was saying this, he saw
the good and chaste Mattidia weeping for joy; but thinking that she was
grieved at having suffered so much in past times, he said: <span
id="fr_1186"></span>[1187](#fn_1186.md)   “Take courage, O woman; for while
many have suffered many evils on account of adultery, you have suffered
on account of chastity, and therefore you did not die.  But if you had
died, your soul would have been saved.  You left your native city of
Rome on account of chastity, but through it you found the truth, the
diadem of the eternal kingdom.  You underwent danger in the deep, but
you did not die; and even if you had died, the deep itself would have
proved to you, dying on account of chastity, a baptism for the salvation
of your soul.  You were deprived of your children for a little; but
these, the true offspring of your husband, have been found in better
circumstances.  When starving, you begged for food, but you did not
defile your body by fornication.  You exposed your body to torture, but
you saved your soul; you fled from the adulterer, that you might not
defile the couch of your husband:  but, on account of your chastity,
God, who knows your flight, will fill up the place of your husband. 
Grieved and left desolate, you were for a short time deprived of husband
and children, but all these you must have been deprived of, some time or
other, by death, the preordained lot of man.  But better is it that you
were willingly deprived of them on account of chastity, than that you
should have perished unwillingly after a time, simply on account of
sins.
