<span id="vi.iv.xv.iv-p2"></span>When, therefore, they had gone, I,
Clement, rejoiced greatly that he had ordered me to remain with
himself.  Then I answered and said, “I thank God that you have not sent
me away as you have done the others, as I should have died of grief.” 
But he said, “But what?  If there shall ever be any necessity that you
be sent away for the sake of teaching, would you, on account of being
separated for a little while from me, and that for an advantageous
purpose, would you die for that?  Would you not rather impress upon
yourself the duty of bearing the things that are arranged for you
through necessity, and cheerfully submit?  And do you not know that
friends are present with one another in their memories, although they
are separated bodily; whereas some, being bodily present, wander from
their friends in their souls, by reason of want of memory?”
