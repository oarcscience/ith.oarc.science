<span id="vi.iii.ix.xxi-p2"></span>When Peter had thus spoken, the
woman, struck with astonishment, fainted.  Then Peter began to hold her
up, and to comfort her, and to ask what was the matter, or what she
suffered.  But she at length, with difficulty recovering her breath, and
nerving herself up to the greatness of the joy which she hoped for, and
at the same time wiping her face, said:  “Is he here, the youth of whom
you speak?”  But Peter, when he understood the matter, said:  “Tell me
first, or else you shall not see him.”  Then she said:  “I am the mother
of the youth.”  Then says Peter:  “What is his name?”  And she
answered:  “Clement.”  Then said Peter:  “It is himself; and he it was
that spoke with me a little while ago, and whom I ordered to go before
me to the ship.”  Then she fell down at Peter’s feet and began to
entreat him that he would hasten to the ship.  Then Peter said:  “Yes,
if you will promise me that you will do as I say.”  Then she said:  “I
will do anything; only show me my only son, for I think that in him I
shall see my twins also.”  Then Peter said:  “When you have seen him,
dissemble for a little time, until we leave the island.”  “I will do
so,” she said.
