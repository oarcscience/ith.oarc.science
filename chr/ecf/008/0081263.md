<span id="vii.xii.xi-p2"></span>And Jesus went forth out of the
prætorium, and the two malefactors with Him.  And when they came to the
place, they stripped Him of his clothes, and girded Him with a towel,
and put a crown of thorns on Him round His head.  And they crucified
Him; and at the same time also they hung up the two malefactors along
with Him.  And Jesus said:  Father, forgive them, for they know not what
they do.  And the soldiers parted His clothes among them; and the people
stood looking at Him.  And the chief priests, and the rulers with them,
mocked Him, saying:  He saved others; let him save himself.  If he be
the Son of God, let him come down from the cross.  And the soldiers made
sport of Him, coming near and offering Him vinegar mixed with gall, and
said:  Thou art the king of the Jews; save thyself. <span

<span id="vii.xii.xi-p4"></span>And Pilate, after the sentence, ordered
the charge made against Him to be inscribed as a superscription in
Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, according to what the Jews had said:  He
is king of the Jews.

<span id="vii.xii.xi-p5"></span>And one of the malefactors hanging up
spoke to Him, saying:  If thou be the Christ, save thyself and us.  And
Dysmas answering, reproved him, saying:  Dost thou not fear God, because
thou art in the same condemnation?  And we indeed justly, for we receive
the fit punishment of our deeds; but this man has done no evil.  And he
said to Jesus:  Remember me, Lord, in Thy kingdom.  And Jesus said to
him:  Amen, amen; I say to thee, To-day shalt thou be <span
