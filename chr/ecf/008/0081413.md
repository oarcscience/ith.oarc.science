<span id="viii.v.ii-p2"></span>Of the life in common, and of the reason
why the Church has begun to hold property.

<span id="viii.v.ii-p3"></span>We know that you are not ignorant of the
fact that hitherto the principle of living with all things in common has
been in vigorous operation among good Christians, and is still so by the
grace of God; and most of all among those who have been chosen to the
lot of the Lord, that is to say, the clergy, even as we read in the Acts
of the Apostles:  “And the multitude of them that believed were of one
heart and of one soul:  neither said any of them that ought of the
things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common. 
And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of
Jesus Christ:  and great grace was upon them all.  Neither was there any
among them that lacked:  for as many as were possessors of lands or
houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,
and laid them down at the apostles’ feet:  and distribution was made
unto every man according as he had need.  And Joseph, who by the
apostles was surnamed Barnabas (which is, being interpreted, the son of
consolation), a Levite, and of the country of Cyprus, having land, sold
it, and brought the money, and laid it at the apostles’ feet;” <span
id="fr_2766"></span>[2767](#fn_2766.md) and so forth.  Accordingly, as the
chief priests and others, and the Levites, and the rest of the faithful,
perceived that it might be of more advantage if they handed over to the
churches over which the bishops presided the heritages and fields which
they were in the way of selling, inasmuch as they might furnish a larger
and better maintenance for the faithful who hold the common faith, not
only in present but also in future times, out of the revenues of such
property than out of the money for which they might at once be sold,
they began to consign to the mother churches the property and lands
which they were wont to sell, and got into the manner of living on the
revenues of these.
