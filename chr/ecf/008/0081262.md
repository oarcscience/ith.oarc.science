<span id="vii.xii.x-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vii.xii.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter 9.</span>

<span id="vii.xii.x-p2"></span>And having summoned Nicodemus and the
twelve men that said He was not born of fornication, he says to them: 
What shall I do, because there is an insurrection among the people? 
They say to him:  We know not; let them see to it.  Again Pilate, having
summoned all the multitude of the Jews, says:  You know that it is
customary, at the feast of unleavened bread, to release one prisoner to
you.  I have one condemned prisoner in the prison, a murderer named
Barabbas, and this man standing in your presence, Jesus, in whom I find
no fault.  Which of them do you wish me to release to you?  And they cry
out:  Barabbas.  Pilate says:  What, then, shall we do to Jesus who is
called Christ?  The Jews say:  Let him be crucified.  And others said: 
Thou art no friend of Cæsar’s if thou release this man, because he
called himself Son of God and king.  You wish, then, this man to be
king, and not Cæsar? <span id="fr_1830"></span>[1831](#fn_1830.md)

<span id="vii.xii.x-p4"></span>And Pilate, in a rage, says to the Jews: 
Always has your nation been rebellious, and you always speak against
your benefactors.  The Jews say:  What benefactors?  He says to them: 
Your God led you out of the land of Egypt from bitter slavery, and
brought you safe through the sea as through dry land, and in the desert
fed you with manna, and gave you quails, and quenched your thirst with
water from a rock, and gave you a law; and in all these things you
provoked your God to anger, and sought a molten calf.  And you
exasperated your God, and He sought to slay you.  And Moses prayed for
you, and you were not put to death.  And now you charge me with hating
the emperor. <span id="fr_1831"></span>[1832](#fn_1831.md)

<span id="vii.xii.x-p6"></span>And rising up from the tribunal, he
sought to go out.  And the Jews cry out, and say:  We know that Cæsar is
king, and not Jesus.  For assuredly the magi brought gifts to him as to
a king.  And when Herod heard from the magi that a king had been born,
he sought to slay him; and his father Joseph, knowing this, took him and
his mother, and they fled into Egypt.  And Herod hearing of it,
destroyed the children of the Hebrews that had been born in
Bethlehem. <span id="fr_1832"></span>[1833](#fn_1832.md)

<span id="vii.xii.x-p8"></span>And when Pilate heard these words, he was
afraid; and ordering the crowd to keep silence, because they were crying
out, he said to them:  So this is he whom Herod sought?  The Jews say: 
Yes, it is he.  And, taking water, Pilate washed his hands in the face
of the sun, saying:  I am innocent of the blood of this just man; see
you to it.  Again the Jews cry out:  His blood be upon us, and upon our
children.

<span id="vii.xii.x-p9"></span>Then Pilate ordered the curtain of the
tribunal where he was sitting to be drawn, <span
id="fr_1833"></span>[1834](#fn_1833.md) and says to Jesus:  Thy nation has
charged thee with being a king.  On this account I sentence thee, first
to be scourged, according to the enactment of venerable kings, and then
to be fastened on the cross in the garden where thou wast seized.  And
let Dysmas and Gestas, the two malefactors, be crucified with thee.
