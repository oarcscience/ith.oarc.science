id="vi.iii.v.xlvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter LVI.—Simon Resisted Peter, as the
Magicians Moses.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.v.xlvi-p2"></span>“In a similar transaction I see that
I am even now engaged.  For as then, when Moses exhorted the king to
believe God, the magicians opposed him by a pretended exhibition of
similar signs, and so kept back the unbelievers from salvation; so also
now, when I have come forth to teach all nations to believe in the true
God, Simon the magician resists me, acting in opposition to me, as they
also did in opposition to Moses; in order that whosoever they be from
among the nations that do not use sound judgment, they may be made
manifest; but that those may be saved who rightly distinguish signs from
signs.”  While Peter thus spoke, Niceta answered:  “I beseech you that
you would permit me to state whatever occurs to my mind.”  Then Peter,
being delighted with the eagerness of his disciples, said:  “Speak what
you will.”
