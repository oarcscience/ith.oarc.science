<span id="v.iv.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIII.—The History of Susanna Teaches
Circumspection with the Eyes and in Society.</span>

<span id="v.iv.xiii-p2"></span>Hast thou not read, and dost thou not
know, concerning those elders who were in the days of Susanna, who,
because they were constantly with women, and looking upon the beauty
which was another’s, <span id="fr_485"></span>[486](#fn_485.md) fell into
the depths of wantonness, and were not able to keep themselves in a
chaste mind, <span id="fr_486"></span>[487](#fn_486.md) but were overcome
by a depraved disposition, and came suddenly <span
id="fr_487"></span>[488](#fn_487.md) upon the blessed Susanna to corrupt
her.  But she did not consent to their foul passion, but cried unto God,
and God saved her out of the hands of the bad old men.  Does it not,
therefore, behove us to tremble and be afraid, forasmuch as these old
men, judges and elders of the people of God, fell from their dignity
because of a woman?  For they did not keep in mind that which is said: 
“Look thou not on the beauty which is another’s;” and, “The beauty of
woman has destroyed many;” <span id="fr_488"></span>[489](#fn_488.md) and
“With a married woman do not sit;” <span
id="fr_489"></span>[490](#fn_489.md) and that, again, *in* which it says: 
“Is there any one that puts fire in his bosom, and does not burn his
clothes;” <span id="fr_490"></span>[491](#fn_490.md) or, “Does a man walk
on fire, and his feet are not scorched?  So whosoever goeth in to
another man’s wife is not pure from evil, and whosoever comes near to
her shall not escape.” <span id="fr_491"></span>[492](#fn_491.md)   And
again it says:  “Thou shalt not long after the beauty a woman, lest she
take thee captive with her eyelids;” <span
id="fr_492"></span>[493](#fn_492.md) and, “Thou shalt not look upon a
maiden, lest thou perish through desire of her;” <span
id="fr_493"></span>[494](#fn_493.md) and, “With a woman that sings
beautifully thou shalt not constantly be;” <span
id="fr_494"></span>[495](#fn_494.md) and, “Let him that thinketh he
standeth take heed lest he fall.” <span
id="fr_495"></span>[496](#fn_495.md)
