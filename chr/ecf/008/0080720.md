id="vi.iv.vi.xxxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXIII.—Works of
Creation.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.vi.xxxiii-p2"></span>“He alone turned into the four
contrary elements <span id="fr_974"></span>[975](#fn_974) the one,
first, simple substance.  Thus combining them, He made of them myriads
of compounds, that, being turned into opposite natures, and mingled,
they might effect the pleasure of life from the combination of
contraries.  In like manner, He alone, having created races of angels
and spirits by the <span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iv.vi.xxxiii-p3.1"></span>Fiat</span> of His will, peopled the
heavens; as also He decked the visible firmament with stars, to which
also He assigned their paths and arranged their courses.  He compacted
the earth for the production of fruits.  He set bounds to the sea,
marking out a dwelling-place on the dry land. <span
id="fr_975"></span>[976](#fn_975)   He stores up the things in Hades,
designating it as the place of souls; and He filled all places with air,
that all living creatures might be able to breathe safely in order that
they might live.
