id="vi.iv.v.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V.—Excellence of the Knowledge of the
True Prophet.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.v.v-p2"></span>And Peter, being greatly pleased with
this, answered:  “Already hath the rectifying process taken its end, as
regards you, knowing as you do the greatness of the infallible prophecy,
without which it is impossible for any one to receive that which is
supremely profitable.  For of many and diverse blessings which are in
the things which are or which may be, the most blessed of all—whether it
be eternal life, or perpetual health, or a perfect understanding, or
light, or joy, or immortality, or whatever else there is or that can be
supremely good in the nature of things—cannot be possessed without first
knowing things as they are; and this knowledge cannot be otherwise
obtained than by first becoming acquainted with the Prophet of the
truth.
