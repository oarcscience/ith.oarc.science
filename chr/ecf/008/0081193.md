id="vii.v.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 15.</span>

<span id="vii.v.xvi-p2"></span>And on the sixth day they entered
Bethlehem, where they spent the seventh day.  And on the eighth day they
circumcised the child, and called His name Jesus; for so He was called
by the angel before He was conceived in the womb. <span
id="fr_1646"></span>[1647](#fn_1646)   Now, after the days of the
purification of Mary were fulfilled according to the law of Moses, then
Joseph took the infant to the temple of the Lord.  And when the infant
had received parhithomus, <span id="fr_1647"></span>[1648](#fn_1647)
—parhithomus, that is, circumcision—they offered for Him a pair of
turtle-doves, or two young pigeons. <span
id="fr_1648"></span>[1649](#fn_1648)

<span id="vii.v.xvi-p6"></span>Now there was in the temple a man of God,
perfect and just, whose name was Symeon, a hundred and twelve years
old.  He had received the answer from the Lord, that he should not taste
of death till he had seen Christ, the Son of God, living in the flesh. 
And having seen the child, he cried out with a loud voice, saying:  God
hath visited His people, and the Lord hath fulfilled His promise.  And
he made haste, and adored Him.  And after this he took Him up into his
cloak and kissed His feet, and said:  Lord, now lettest Thou Thy servant
depart in peace, according to Thy word:  for mine eyes have seen Thy
salvation, which Thou hast prepared before the face of all peoples, to
be a light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of Thy people
Israel. <span id="fr_1649"></span>[1650](#fn_1649)

<span id="vii.v.xvi-p8"></span>There was also in the temple of the Lord,
Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher, who
had lived with her husband seven years from her virginity; and she had
now been a widow eighty-four years.  And she never left the temple of
the Lord, but spent her time in fasting and prayer.  She also likewise
adored the child, saying:  In Him is the redemption of the world. <span
