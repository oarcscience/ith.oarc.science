<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.iii.xii-p2"></A>Having then stopped for a few days, and having in some measure finished the business of collecting what was owing to me (for I neglected many things through my desire of hastening, that I might not be hindered from my purpose), I set sail direct for Jud&aelig;a, and after fifteen days landed at C&aelig;sarea Stratonis, which is the largest city in Palestine.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_537"></A><A HREF="#fn_537"><FONT SIZE="1">538</FONT></A>
&#160; When I had landed, and was seeking for an inn, I learned from the conversation of the people, that one Peter, a most approved disciple of Him who appeared in Jud&aelig;a, and showed many signs and miracles divinely performed among men, was going to hold a discussion of words and questions the next day with one Simon, a Samaritan.&#160; Having heard this, I asked to be shown his lodging; and having found it, and standing before the door, I informed the doorkeeper who I was, and whence I came; and, behold, Barnabas coming out, as soon as he saw me rushed into my arms, weeping for joy, and, seizing me by the hand, led me in to Peter.&#160; Having pointed him out to me at a distance, &#8220;This,&#8221; said he, &#8220;is Peter, of whom I spoke, to you as the greatest in the wisdom of God, and to whom also I have spoken constantly of you.&#160; Enter, therefore, as one well known to him.&#160; For he is well acquainted with all the good that is in thee, and has carefully made himself aware of your religious purpose, whence also he is greatly desirous to see you.&#160; Therefore I present you to him to-day as a great gift.&#8221;&#160; At the same time, presenting me, he said, &#8220;This, O Peter, is Clement.&#8221;</p>
