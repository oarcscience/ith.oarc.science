id="vi.iv.iv.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V.—A Resolution.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.iv.v-p2"></span>What, then, am I to do, unless this?  I
shall go into Egypt, and I shall become friendly with the hierophants of
the shrines, and with the prophets; and I shall seek and find a
magician, and persuade him with large bribes to effect the calling up of
a soul, which is called necromancy, as if I were going to inquire of it
concerning some business.  And the inquiry shall be for the purpose of
learning whether the soul is immortal.  But the answer of the soul that
it is immortal shall not give me the knowledge from its speaking or my
hearing, but only from its being seen; so that, seeing it with my very
eyes, I may have a self-sufficient and fit assurance, from the very fact
of its appearing, that it exists; and never again shall the uncertain
words of hearing be able to overturn the things which the eyes have made
their own.  However, I submitted this very plan to a certain companion
who was a philosopher; and he counselled me not to venture upon it, and
that on many accounts.  “For if,” said he, “the soul shall not listen to
the magician, you will live with an evil conscience, as having acted
against the laws which forbid the doing of these things.  But if it
shall listen to him, then, besides your living with an evil conscience,
I think that matters of piety will not be promoted to you on account of
your making this attempt.  For they say that the Deity is angry with
those who disturb souls after their release from the body.” <span

indeed more backward to undertake such a thing, but I did not abandon my
original plan; but I was distressed, as being hindered in the execution
of it.
