<span id="vi.iv.xxii.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.xxii.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—Peter Undertakes to
Discuss the Devil’s Origin.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxii.viii-p2"></span>And Peter said:  “Since you compel
us, after we have made accurate investigations into the contrivances of
God, to venture to state them, and that, too, to men who are not able to
comprehend thoroughly the contrivances of their fellow-men, for the sake
at least of those who are present, I, instead of remaining silent—a
course which would be most pious—shall discuss the subjects of which you
wish me to speak.  I agree with you in believing that there is a prince
of evil, of whose origin the Scripture has ventured to say nothing
either true or false.  But let us follow out the inquiry in many ways,
as to how he has come into existence, if it is the fact that he has come
into existence; and of the <span id="page_333">p. 333</span> <span
id="vi.iv.xxii.viii-Page_333"></span>opinions which present themselves,
let us select that which is most reverential, since in the case of
probable opinions, that one is assumed with confidence which *is based
on the principle* that we ought to attribute to God that which is more
reverential; and all the more so, if, when all other suppositions are
removed, there still remains one which is adequate and involves less
danger. <span id="fr_1422"></span>[1423](#fn_1422.md)   But I promise you,
before I proceed with the investigation, that every method in the
investigation can show that God alone is blameless.

<span id="vi.iv.xxii.viii-p3"></span> This sentence is regarded as
corrupt by Wieseler.  We have retained the reading of the Paris <span
class="c9"><span id="vi.iv.xxii.viii-p3.1"></span>ms.</span>, <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.iv.xxii.viii-p3.2"></span>ὁ</span>, and
understand <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.xxii.viii-p3.3"></span>λαμβάνεται</span> after it.  <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.iv.xxii.viii-p3.4"></span>Δὲ</span> would
naturally be inserted after <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.xxii.viii-p3.5"></span>ταύτῃ</span>, but it is not necessary. 
<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.xxii.viii-p3.6"></span>Καθαρθεισῶν</span> is translated in the
Latin *purgatis*, which may mean the same as in our translation if we
take it in the sense of “washed away;” but <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.xxii.viii-p3.7"></span>καθαιρεθεισῶν</span> would be a better
reading.  The translation of Cotelerius gives, “Since this is reasonably
assumed with firmness,—namely, that it is right to give to God,” etc.
