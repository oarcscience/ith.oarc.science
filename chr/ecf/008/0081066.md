id="vi.iv.xix.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIV.—Other Beings Called
Gods.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xix.xiv-p2"></span>“For we ourselves also know that
angels are called gods by the Scriptures,—as, for instance, He who spake
at the bush, and wrestled with Jacob,—and the name is likewise applied
to Him who is born Emmanuel, and who is called the mighty God. <span
id="fr_1296"></span>[1297](#fn_1296)   Yea, even Moses became a god to
Pharaoh, though in reality he was a man.  The same is the case also with
the idols of the Gentiles.  But we have but one God, one who made
creation and arranged the universe, whose Son is the Christ.  Obeying
Christ, <span id="fr_1297"></span>[1298](#fn_1297) we learn to know what
is false from the Scriptures.  Moreover, being furnished by our
ancestors with the truths of the Scriptures, we know that there is only
one who has made the heavens and the earth, the God of the Jews, and of
all who <span id="page_316">p. 316</span> <span
id="vi.iv.xix.xiv-Page_316"></span>choose to worship Him.  Our fathers,
with pious thought, setting down a fixed belief in Him as the true God,
handed down this belief to us, that we may know that if any thing is
said against God, it is a falsehood.  I shall add this remark over and
above what I need say:  If the case be not as I have said, then may I,
and all who love the truth, incur danger in regard to the praise of the
God who made us.”
