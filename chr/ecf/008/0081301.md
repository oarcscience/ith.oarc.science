<span id="vii.xv.i-p6"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.xv.i-p6.1"></span>I Æneas</span> was at first a protector of the
Hebrews, and follower of the law; then the grace of the Saviour and His
great gift took possession of me.  I recognised Christ Jesus in holy
Scripture; I came to Him, and embraced His faith, so that I might become
worthy of His holy baptism.  First of all I searched for the memoirs
written in those times about our Lord Jesus Christ, which the Jews
published in the age of Pontius Pilate, and we found them in Hebrew
writings, drawn up in the age of the Lord Jesus Christ; and I translated
them into the language of the Gentiles, in the reign of the eminent
Theodosius, who was fulfilling his seventeenth consulship, and of
Valentinian, consul for the fifth time in the ninth indiction. 
Whosoever of you read this book, and transfer it to other copies,
remember me, and pray for me, Æneas, least of the servants of God, that
He be merciful to me, and pardon my sins which I have committed against
Him.  Peace be to all who shall read these, and to all their house, for
ever!  Amen.

<span id="vii.xv.i-p7"></span>Now it came to pass, in the nineteenth
year of the reign of Tiberius Cæsar, emperor of the Romans, and of
Herod, son of Herod king of Galilee, in the nineteenth year of his rule,
on the eighth day before the kalends of April, which is the twenty-fifth
day of the month of March, in the consulship of Rufinus and Rubellio, in
the fourth year of the 202d Olympiad, under the rule of Joseph and
Caiaphas, priests of the Jews:  the things done by the chief priests and
the rest of the Jews, which Nicodemus recorded after the cross and
passion of the Lord, Nicodemus himself committed to Hebrew letters.
