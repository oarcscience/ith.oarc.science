id="vi.iv.xi.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.—Many Called.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xi.iv-p2"></span>Then Peter, wondering at the eagerness
of the multitudes, answered, <span id="fr_1088"></span>[1089](#fn_1088)
“You see, brethren, how the words of our Lord are manifestly fulfilled. 
For I remember His saying, ‘Many shall come from the east and from the
west, the north and the south, and shall recline on the bosoms of
Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob.’ <span
id="fr_1089"></span>[1090](#fn_1089)   ‘But many,’ said He also, ‘are
called, but few chosen.’ <span id="fr_1090"></span>[1091](#fn_1090)  
The coming, therefore, of these called ones is fulfilled.  But inasmuch
as it is not of themselves, but of God who has called them and caused
them to come, on this account alone they have no reward, since it is not
of themselves but of Him who has wrought in them.  But if, after being
called, they do things that are excellent, for this is of themselves,
then for this they shall have a reward.
