id="vi.iii.iv.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII.—Simon Magus and Luna.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iv.xii-p2"></span>“Therefore, after the death of
Dositheus Simon took Luna to himself; and with her he still goes about,
as you see, deceiving multitudes, and asserting that he himself is a
certain power which is above God the Creator, while Luna, who is with
him, has been brought down from the higher heavens, and that she is
Wisdom, the mother of all things, for whom, says he, the Greeks and
barbarians contending, were able in some measure to see an image of her;
but of herself, as she is, as the dweller with the first and only God,
they were wholly ignorant.  Propounding these and other things of the
same sort, he has deceived many.  But I ought also to state this, which
I remember that I myself saw.  Once, when this Luna of his was in a
certain tower, a great multitude had assembled to see her, and were
standing around the tower on all sides; but she was seen by all the
people to lean forward, and to look out through all the windows of that
tower. <span id="fr_608"></span>[609](#fn_608.md)   Many other wonderful
things he did and does; so that men, being astonished at them, think
that he himself is the great God.”

<span id="vi.iii.iv.xii-p3"></span> The meaning seems to be, that she
was seen at all the windows at once.—<span class="c9"><span
