id="vi.iv.iii.i-p3.1"></span>Clement</span> to James, the lord, <span
id="fr_894"></span>[895](#fn_894.md) and the bishop of bishops, who rules
Jerusalem, the holy church of the Hebrews, and the churches everywhere
excellently founded by the providence of God, with the elders and
deacons, and the rest of the brethren, peace be always.

<span id="vi.iv.iii.i-p5"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.iii.i-p5.1"></span>Chapter I.—Peter’s Martyrdom.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.iii.i-p6"></span>Be it known to you, my lord, that
Simon, who, for the sake of the true faith, and the most sure foundation
of his doctrine, was set apart to be the foundation of the Church, and
for this end was by Jesus Himself, with His truthful mouth, named Peter,
the first-fruits of our Lord, the first of the apostles; to whom first
the Father revealed the Son; whom the Christ, with good reason, blessed;
the called, and elect, and associate at table and in the journeyings *of
Christ;* the excellent and approved disciple, who, as being fittest of
all, was commanded to enlighten the darker part of the world, namely the
West, and was enabled to accomplish it,—and to what extent do I lengthen
my discourse, not wishing to indicate what is sad, which yet of
necessity, though reluctantly, I must tell you,—he himself, by reason of
his immense love towards men, having come as far as Rome, clearly and
publicly testifying, in opposition to the wicked one who withstood him,
that there is to be a good King over all the world, while saving men by
his God-inspired doctrine, himself, by violence, exchanged this present
existence for life.

<span id="vi.iv.iii.i-p4"></span> More probably “the Lord’s brother.” 
So it must have been in the text from which Rufinus translated.  \[That
this means “James the Lord’s brother” is quite certain, but it is not
necessary to adopt this reading here; comp. chap. 20 and the opening
sentence of the previous epistle.  In *Recognitions*, iii. 74, Clement
is represented as writing “my lord James.”—R.\]
