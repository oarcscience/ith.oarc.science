id="vi.iii.vii.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter III.—Faith and Unbelief.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.vii.iii-p2"></span>“Whereas therefore some men suffer,
and others cure those who suffer, it is necessary to know the cause at
once of the suffering and the cure; and this is proved to be nought else
than unbelief on the part of the sufferers, and faith on the part of
those who cure them.  For unbelief, while it does not believe that there
is to be a judgment by God, affords licence to sin, and sin makes men
liable to sufferings; but faith, believing that there is to be a
judgment of God, restrains men from sin; and those who do not sin are
not only free from demons and sufferings, but can also put to flight the
demons and sufferings of others.
