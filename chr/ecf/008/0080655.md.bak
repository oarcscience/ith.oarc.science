<span id="vi.iv.v.xxii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.v.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXII.—Doctrines of Simon.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.v.xxii-p2"></span>First Aquila began to speak in this
wise:  “Listen, O dearest brother, that you may know accurately
everything about this man, whose he is, and what, and whence; and what
the things are which he does, and how and why he does them. <span
id="fr_930"></span>[931](#fn_930.md)   This Simon is the son of Antonius
and Rachel, a Samaritan by race, of the village of Gitthæ, which is six
schoeni distant from the city.  He having disciplined himself greatly in
Alexandria, <span id="fr_931"></span>[932](#fn_931.md) and being very
powerful in magic, and being ambitious, wishes to be accounted a certain
supreme power, greater even than the God who created the world.  And
sometimes intimating <span id="page_233">p. 233</span> <span
id="vi.iv.v.xxii-Page_233"></span>that he is Christ, he styles himself
the Standing One. <span id="fr_932"></span>[933](#fn_932.md)   And this
epithet he employs, as intimating that he shall always stand, and as not
having any cause of corruption so that his body should fall.  And he
neither says that the God who created the world is the Supreme, nor does
he believe that the dead will be raised.  He rejects Jerusalem, and
substitutes Mount Gerizzim for it.  Instead of our Christ, he proclaims
himself.  The things of the law he explains by his own presumption; and
he says, indeed, that there is to be a judgment, but he does not expect
it.  For if he were persuaded that he shall be judged by God, he would
not dare be impious towards God Himself.  Whence some not knowing that,
using religion as a cloak, he spoils the things of the truth, and
faithfully believing the hope and the judgment which in some way he says
are to be, are ruined.
