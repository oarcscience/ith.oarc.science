<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.v.xi-p2"></A>Then said Peter:&#160; &#8220;I advise that the first inquiry be, whether it be in our power to know whence we are to be judged.&#8221;&#160; But Simon said:&#160; &#8220;Not so; but concerning God, about whom all who are present are desirous to hear.&#8221;&#160; Then Peter:&#160; &#8220;You admit, then, that something is in the power of the will:&#160; only confess this, if it is so, and let us inquire, as you say, concerning God.&#8221;&#160; To this Simon answered:&#160; &#8220;By no means.&#8221;&#160; Then Peter said:&#160; &#8220;If, then, nothing is in our power, it is useless for us to inquire anything concerning God, since it is not in the power of those who seek to find; hence I said well, that this should be the first inquiry, whether <A NAME="page_120"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 120</FONT></A> <a name="vi.iii.v.xi-Page_120"></A>anything is in the power of the will.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_681"></A><A HREF="#fn_681"><FONT SIZE="1">682</FONT></A>
&#160; Then said Simon:&#160; &#8220;We cannot even understand this that you say, if there is anything in the power of the will.&#8221;&#160; But Peter, seeing that he was turning to contention, and, through fear of being overcome, was confounding all things as being in general uncertain, answered:&#160; &#8220;How then do you know that it is not in the power of man to know anything, since this very thing at least you know?&#8221;</p>
