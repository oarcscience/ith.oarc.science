<span id="x.v.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="x.v.ix-p1.1"></span>II.</span>

<span id="x.v.ix-p2"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="x.v.ix-p2.1"></span>From the Apology Addressed to Marcus Aurelius
Antoninus. <span id="fr_3607"></span>[3608](#fn_3607) </span>

<span id="x.v.ix-p4"></span>For the race of the pious is now persecuted
in a way contrary to all precedent, being harassed by a new kind of
edicts <span id="fr_3608"></span>[3609](#fn_3608) everywhere in Asia. 
For unblushing informers, and such as are greedy of other men’s goods,
taking occasion from the orders *issued*, carry on their robbery without
any disguise, plundering of their property night and day those who are
guilty of no wrong.

<span id="x.v.ix-p6"></span>If these proceedings take place at thy
bidding, <span id="fr_3609"></span>[3610](#fn_3609) well and good. <span
id="fr_3610"></span>[3611](#fn_3610)   For a just sovereign will never
take unjust measures; and we, on our part, gladly accept the honour of
such a death.  This request only we present to thee, that thou wouldst
first of all examine for thyself into the behaviour of these *reputed*
agents of so much strife, and then come to a just decision as to whether
they merit death and punishment, or deserve to live in safety and
quiet.  But if, on the contrary, it shall turn out that this measure,
and this new sort of command, which it would be unbecoming to employ
even against barbarian foemen, do not proceed from thee, then all the
more do we entreat thee not to leave us thus exposed to the spoliation
of the populace.

<span id="x.v.ix-p9"></span>For the philosophy current with us
flourished in the first instance among barbarians; <span
id="fr_3611"></span>[3612](#fn_3611) and, when it afterwards sprang up
among the nations under thy rule, during the distinguished reign of thy
ancestor Augustus, it proved to be a blessing of most happy omen to thy
empire.  For from that time the Roman power has risen to greatness and
splendour.  To this power thou hast succeeded as the much desired <span
id="fr_3612"></span>[3613](#fn_3612) possessor; and such shalt thou
continue, together with thy son, <span
id="fr_3613"></span>[3614](#fn_3613) if thou protect that philosophy
which has grown up with thy empire, and which took its rise with
Augustus; to which also thy *more recent* ancestors paid honour, along
with the other religions *prevailing in the empire*.  A very strong
proof, moreover, that it was for good that the system we profess came to
prevail at the same time that the empire of such happy commencement was
established, is this—that ever since the reign of Augustus nothing
untoward has happened; but, on the contrary, everything has contributed
to the splendour and renown *of the empire*, in accordance with the
devout wishes <span id="fr_3614"></span>[3615](#fn_3614) of all.  Nero
and Domitian alone of all *the emperors*, imposed <span id="page_759">p.
759</span> <span id="x.v.ix-Page_759"></span>upon by certain
calumniators, have cared to bring any impeachment against our
doctrines.  They, too, are the source from which it has happened that
the lying slanders on those who profess them have, in consequence of the
senseless habit which prevails *of taking things on hear*say, flowed
down to our own times. <span id="fr_3615"></span>[3616](#fn_3615)   But
the course which they in their ignorance pursued was set aside by thy
pious progenitors, who frequently and in many instances rebuked by their
rescripts <span id="fr_3616"></span>[3617](#fn_3616) those who dared to
set on foot any hostilities against them.  It appears, for example, that
thy grandfather Adrian wrote, among others, to Fundanus, the proconsul
then in charge of the government of Asia.  Thy father, too, when thou
thyself wast associated with him <span
id="fr_3617"></span>[3618](#fn_3617) in the administration of the
empire, wrote to the cities, forbidding them to take any measures
adverse to us:  among the rest to the people of Larissa, and of
Thessalonica, and of Athens, and, *in short*, to all the Greeks.  And as
regards thyself, seeing that thy sentiments respecting the
Christians <span id="fr_3618"></span>[3619](#fn_3618) are not only the
same as theirs, but even much more generous and wise, we are the more
persuaded that thou wilt do all that we ask of thee.
