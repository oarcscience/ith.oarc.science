<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xviii.x-p2"></A>And our father said:&#160; &#8220;How then is this?&#160; Do we not see many impious men poor?&#160; Then do these belong to the saved on this account?&#8221;&#160; And Peter said:&#160; &#8220;Not at all; for that poverty is not acceptable which longs for what it ought not.&#160; So that some are rich as far as their choice goes, though poor in actual wealth, and they are punished because they desire to have more.&#160; But one is not unquestionably righteous because he happens to be poor.&#160; For he can be a beggar as far as actual wealth is concerned, but he may desire and even do what above everything he ought not to do.
