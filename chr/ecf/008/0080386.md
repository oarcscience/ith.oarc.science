id="vi.iii.ix.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIX.—Peter’s Reflections on the
Story.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.ix.xix-p2"></span>While she was speaking, Peter, being
distracted with much thought, stood like one thunder-struck; and I
Clement coming up, said:  “I have been seeking you everywhere, and now
what are we to do?”  But he commanded me to go before him to the ship,
and there to wait for him; and because he must not be gainsayed, I did
as he commanded me.  But he, as he afterwards told me the whole, being
struck with a sort of suspicion, asked of the woman her family, and her
country, and the names of her sons; “and straightway,” he said, “if you
tell me these things, I shall give you the remedy.”  But she, like one
suffering violence, because she would not confess these things, and yet
was desirous of the remedy, feigned one thing after another, saying that
she was an Ephesian, and her husband a Sicilian, and giving false names
to her sons.  Then Peter, supposing that she had answered truly, said: 
“Alas! O woman, I thought that some great joy should spring up to us
to-day; for I suspected that you were a certain woman, concerning whom I
lately learned certain like things.”  But she adjured him, saying:  “I
entreat you to tell me what they are, <span id="page_161">p. 161</span>
<span id="vi.iii.ix.xix-Page_161"></span>that I may know if amongst
women there be one more unfortunate than myself.”
