Water?”</span>

<span id="vi.iii.ix.xxx-p2"></span>Then she, when she heard this, said: 
“And what hinders me to be baptized to-day?  For even before I saw you I
was wholly alienated from those whom they call gods because they were
not able to do anything for me, although I frequently, and almost daily,
sacrificed to them.  And as to chastity, what shall I say, when neither
in former times did pleasures deceive me, nor afterwards did poverty
compel me to sin?  But I think you know well enough how great was my
love of chastity, when I pretended that dream that I might escape the
snares of unhallowed love, and that I might go abroad with my two twins,
and when I left this my son Clement alone to be a comfort to his
father.  For if two were scarcely enough for me, how much more it would
have saddened their father, if he had had none at all?  For he was
wretched through his great affection towards our sons, so that even the
authority of the dream could scarce prevail upon him to give up to me
Faustinus and Faustus, the brothers of this Clement, and that himself
should be content with Clement alone.”
