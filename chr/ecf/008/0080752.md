<span id="vi.iv.vi.lxv-p2"></span>“And consider this other thing, that
in proportion as there is labour and danger in ruling the Church of
Christ, so much greater is the reward.  And yet again the greater is
also the punishment to him who can, and refuses.  I wish, therefore,
knowing that you are the best instructed of my attendants, to turn to
account those noble powers of judging with which you have been entrusted
by the Lord, in order that you may be saluted with the <span
class="c9"><span id="vi.iv.vi.lxv-p2.1"></span>Well done, good and
faithful servant</span>, and not be found fault with, and declared
liable to punishment, like him who hid the one talent.  But if you will
not be appointed a good guardian of the Church, point out another in
your stead, more learned and more faithful than yourself.  But you
cannot do this; for you associated with the Lord, and witnessed His
marvellous doings, and learned the administration of the Church.
