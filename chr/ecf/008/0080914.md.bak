id="vi.iv.xiii.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII.—Unprofitableness of
Idols.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xiii.vii-p2"></span>“Begin, <span
id="fr_1121"></span>[1122](#fn_1121.md) then, to divest yourselves of the
injurious fear of vain idols, that you may escape unrighteous bondage. 
For they have become your masters, who even as servants are unprofitable
to you.  I speak of the material of the lifeless images, which are of no
use to you as far as service is concerned.  For they neither hear nor
see nor feel, nor can they be moved.  For is there any one of you who
would like to see as they see, and to hear as they hear, and to feel as
they feel, and to be moved as they are?  God forbid that such a wrong
should be done to any man bearing the image of God, though he have lost
His likeness.
