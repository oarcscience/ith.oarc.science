<p class="c35"><a name="vi.iv.vii.xvi-p1"></A> <span class="c1"><a name="vi.iv.vii.xvi-p1.1"></A>Chapter XVI.&#8212;Wickedness of Jupiter.</span></p> 
<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.vii.xvi-p2"></A>&#8220;But I shall begin with the most royal Zeus, whose father Kronos, having, as you say, devoured his own children, and having shorn off the members of his father Uranus with a sickle of adamant, showed to those who are zealous for the mysteries of the gods an example of piety towards parents and of love towards children.&#160; And Jupiter himself bound his own father, and imprisoned him in Tartarus; and he also punishes the other gods.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1038"></A><A HREF="#fn_1038"><FONT SIZE="1">1039</FONT></A>
&#160; And for those who wish to do things not to be spoken of, he begat Metis, and devoured her.&#160; But Metis was seed; for it is impossible to devour a child.&#160; And for an excuse to abusers of themselves with mankind, he carries away Ganymedes.&#160; And as a helper of adulterers in their adultery, he is often found an adulterer.&#160; And to those who wish to commit incest with sisters, he sets the example in his intercourse with his sisters Hera and Demeter, and the heavenly Aphrodite, whom some call Dodona.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1039"></A><A HREF="#fn_1039"><FONT SIZE="1">1040</FONT></A>
&#160; And to those who wish to commit incest with their daughters, there is a wicked example from his story, in his committing incest with Persephone.&#160; But in myriads of instances he acted impiously, that by reason of his excessive wickedness the fable of his being a god might be received by impious men.</p>
