id="vii.xv.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 5.</span>

<span id="vii.xv.vi-p2"></span>But one Nicodemus, a Jew, stood before
the governor, and said:  I entreat, mercifully allow me to say a few
words.  Pilate says to him:  Say on.  Nicodemus says:  I said to the
elders and the priests and the Levites, and to all the multitude of the
Jews, in the synagogue, What have you *to do* with this man?  This man
does many wonders and signs, which no one of men has done or can do. 
Let him go, and do not devise any evil against him:  if the signs which
he does are of God, they will stand; but if of men, they will come to
nothing.  For Moses also, being sent by God into Egypt, did many signs,
which God told him to do before Pharaoh king of Egypt.  And the
sorcerers Jamnes and Mambres were there healing, and they did, they
also, the signs which Moses did, but not all; and the Egyptians deemed
them as gods, Jamnes and Mambres.  And since the signs which they did
were not of God, they perished, both they and those who believed in
them.  And now let this man go, for he is not deserving of death.

<span id="vii.xv.vi-p3"></span>The Jews say to Nicodemus:  Thou hast
become his disciple, and takest his part. <span
id="fr_1959"></span>[1960](#fn_1959)   Nicodemus says to them:  Has the
governor also become his disciple, and does he take his part?  Has not
Cæsar set him over that dignity?  And the Jews were raging and gnashing
with their teeth against Nicodemus.  Pilate says to them:  Why do you
gnash with your teeth against him, *when you are* hearing the truth? 
The Jews say to Nicodemus:  Mayst thou receive his truth, and a portion
with him!  Nicodemus says:  Amen, amen, amen; may I receive *it*, as you
have said!
