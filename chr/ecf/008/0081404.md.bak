<span id="viii.iv.ii.ii-p2"></span>(Of those who conspire against
bishops, or who take part with such.)

<span id="viii.iv.ii.ii-p3"></span>Now we have heard that the crime of
conspiracies prevails in your parts, and it has been shown us that the
people are conspiring against their bishops; of which crime the craft is
hateful, not only among Christians, but even among the heathen, and it
is forbidden by foreign laws.  And therefore the laws not only of the
Church, but of the world, condemn those who are guilty of this crime;
and not only those indeed who actually conspire, but those also who take
part with such. <span id="fr_2733"></span>[2734](#fn_2733.md)   Our
predecessors, moreover, together with a very numerous body of bishops,
ordained that any *guilty of this offence* among those who are set in
the honour of the priesthood, and who belong to the clergy, should be
deprived of the honour which they enjoy; and they ordered that others
should be cut off from communion, and expelled from the Church; and they
decreed, at the same time, that all men of both orders should be
infamous (*infames*); and that, too, not only for those who did the
deed, but for those also who took part with such.  For it is but
equitable that those who despise the divine mandates, and prove
themselves disobedient to the ordinances of the fathers, should be
chastised with severer penalties, in order that others may fear to do
such things, and that all may rejoice in brotherly concord, and all take
to themselves the example of severity and goodness.  For if (which may
God forbid) we neglect the care of the Church, and are regardless of its
strength, our slothfulness will destroy discipline, and injury will be
done assuredly to the souls of the faithful.  Such persons, moreover,
are not to be admitted to accuse any one:  neither can their voice, nor
that of those who are under the ban, injure or criminate any man.
