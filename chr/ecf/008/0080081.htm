<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.iii.xix-p2"></A>Then Peter, when he heard me speak thus, said:&#160; &#8220;I give thanks to my God, both for your salvation and for my own peace; for I am greatly delighted to see that you have understood what is the greatness of the prophetic virtue, and because, as you say, not even I myself, if I should wish it (which God forbid!), should be able to turn you away to another faith.&#160; Now henceforth begin to be with us, and to-morrow be present at our discussions, for I am to have a contest with Simon the magician.&#8221;&#160; When he had thus spoken, he retired to take food along with his friends; but he ordered me to eat by myself;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_540"></A><A HREF="#fn_540"><FONT SIZE="1">541</FONT></A>
 and after the meal, when he had sung praise to God and given thanks, he rendered to me an account of this proceeding, and added, &#8220;May the Lord grant to thee to be made like to us in all things, that, receiving baptism, thou mayest be able to meet with us at the same table.&#8221;&#160; Having thus spoken, he ordered me to go to rest, for by this time both fatigue and the time of the day called to sleep.</p>
