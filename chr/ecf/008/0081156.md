id="vi.iv.xxiii.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI.—Arrival of Appion and
Annubion.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxiii.xi-p2"></span>And as we were going to take our
meals, <span id="fr_1519"></span>[1520](#fn_1519.md) some one ran in and
said:  “Appion Pleistonices has just come with Annubion from Antioch,
and he is lodging with Simon.”  And my father hearing this, and
rejoicing, said to Peter:  “If you permit me, I shall go to salute
Appion and <span id="page_343">p. 343</span> <span
id="vi.iv.xxiii.xi-Page_343"></span>Annubion, who have been my friends
from childhood.  For perchance I shall persuade Annubion to discuss
genesis with Clement.”  And Peter said:  “I permit you, and I praise you
for fulfilling the duties of a friend.  But now consider how in the
providence of God there come together from all quarters considerations
which contribute to your full assurance, rendering the harmony
complete.  But I say this because the arrival of Annubion happens
advantageously for you.”  And my father:  “In truth, I see that this is
the case.”  And saying this, he went to Simon.
