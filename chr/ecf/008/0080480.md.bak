id="vi.iii.xi.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI.—Fear.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.xi.xi-p2"></span>“But some one will say, And what shall
we do now, whom it has already happened to us to be smeared with sins as
with pitch?  I answer:  Nothing; but hasten to be washed, that the fuel
of the fire may be cleansed out of you by the invocation of the holy
name, and that for the future you may bridle your lusts by fear of the
judgment to come, and with all constancy beat back the hostile powers
whenever they approach your senses.  But you say, If any one fall into
love, how shall he be able to contain himself, though he see before his
eyes even that river of fire which they call Pyriphlegethon?  This is
the excuse of those who will not be converted to repentance.  But now I
would not have you talk of Pyriphlegethon.  Place before you human
punishments, and see what influence fear has.  When any one is brought
to punishment for the crime of love, and is bound to the stake to be
burned, can he at that time conceive any desire of her whom he loved, or
place her image before his eyes?  By no means, you will say.  You see,
then, that present fear cuts off unrighteous desires.  But if those who
believe in God, and who confess the judgment to come, and the penalty of
eternal fire,—if they do not refrain from sin, it is certain that they
do not believe with full faith:  for if faith is certain, fear also
becomes certain; but if there be any detect in faith, fear also is
weakened, and then the contrary powers find opportunity of entering. 
And when they have consented to their persuasions, they necessarily
become subject also to their power, and by their instigation are driven
to the precipices of sin.
