Thanksgiving.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.xii.lxix-p2"></span>Stating these and such like things,
they bring to him those distressed with sicknesses, and tormented with
demons, paralytics also, and those suffering diverse perils; and there
was an infinite number of sick people collected.  And when Peter saw
that they not only repented of the evil thoughts they had entertained of
him through means of Simon, but also that they showed so entire faith in
God, that they believed that all who suffered from every sort of ailment
could be healed by him, he spread out his hands towards heaven, pouring
out prayers with tears, and gave thanks to God, saying:  “I bless thee,
O Father, worthy of all praise, who hast deigned to fulfil every word
and promise of Thy Son, that every creature may know that Thou alone art
God in heaven and in earth.”
