<span id="x.xiv"></span>

<span id="x.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c6"><span
id="x.xiv-p1.1"></span>Apollonius. <span
id="fr_3795"></span>[3796](#fn_3795.md) </span>

<span id="x.xiv-p3"></span>\[<span class="c9"><span
id="x.xiv-p3.1"></span>a.d.</span> 211.\]  He was a most eloquent man,
according to St. Jerome; and his writings against Montanism were so
forcible as to call forth Tertullian himself, to confute him, if
possible.  He flourished under Commodus and Severus, and probably until
the times of Caracalla.  He bears testimony to the existence of a canon
of Scripture, <span id="fr_3796"></span>[3797](#fn_3796.md) and to its
inspired authority as the rule of faith and practice; and he witnesses,
by citation, to the Gospel of St. Matthew.  The Revelation of St. John
also, according to Eusebius, was employed by him in his works; and he
preserves a tradition that our Lord bade the Apostles continue in
Jerusalem for the space of twelve years.  We cannot affirm that he was
invested with any office in the Church.

<span id="x.xiv-p5"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="x.xiv-p5.1"></span>Concerning Montanism. <span
id="fr_3797"></span>[3798](#fn_3797.md) </span>

<span id="x.xiv-p7"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="x.xiv-p7.1"></span>I.</span>

<span id="x.xiv-p8"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="x.xiv-p8.1"></span>But</span> who is this new teacher?  His works
and teaching inform *us*.  This is he who taught the dissolution of
marriage; who inculcated fasting; who called Peruga and Tymius, small
towns of Phrygia, Jerusalem, because he wished to collect thither people
from all parts; who set up exactors of money; who craftily contrives the
taking of gifts under the name of voluntary offerings; who grants
stipends to those who publish abroad his doctrine, that by means of
gluttony the teaching of the doctrine may prevail.

<span id="x.xiv-p9"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="x.xiv-p9.1"></span>II.</span>

<span id="x.xiv-p10"></span>We declare to you, then, that these first
prophetesses, as soon as they were filled with the spirit, left their
husbands.  Of what falsehood, then, were they guilty in calling Prisca a
maiden!  <span id="page_776">p. 776</span> <span
id="x.xiv-Page_776"></span>Do you not think that all Scripture forbids a
prophet to receive gifts and money?  When, therefore, I see that the
prophetess has received gold and silver and expensive articles of dress,
how can I avoid treating her with disapproval?

<span id="x.xiv-p11"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="x.xiv-p11.1"></span>III.</span>

<span id="x.xiv-p12"></span>Moreover, Themison also, who was clothed in
a garb of plausible <span id="fr_3798"></span>[3799](#fn_3798.md)
covetousness, who declined to bear the sign of confessorship, but by a
large sum of money put away from him the chains *of martyrdom*, although
after such conduct it was his duty to conduct himself with humility, yet
had the hardihood to boast that he was a martyr, and, in imitation of
the apostle, to compose a general epistle, in which he attempted to
instruct <span id="fr_3799"></span>[3800](#fn_3799.md) in the elements of
the faith those who had believed to better purpose than he, and defended
the doctrines of the new-fangled teaching, <span
id="fr_3800"></span>[3801](#fn_3800.md) and moreover uttered blasphemy
against the Lord and the apostles and the holy Church.

<span id="x.xiv-p16"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="x.xiv-p16.1"></span>IV.</span>

<span id="x.xiv-p17"></span>But, not to dwell further on these matters,
let the prophetess tell us concerning Alexander, who calls himself a
martyr, with whom she joins in banqueting; who himself also is
worshipped by many; <span id="fr_3801"></span>[3802](#fn_3801.md) whose
robberies and other deeds of daring, for which he has been punished, it
is not necessary for us to speak of, since the treasury <span
id="fr_3802"></span>[3803](#fn_3802.md) has him in keeping.  Which of them,
then, condones the sins of the other?  The prophet the robberies of the
martyr, or the martyr the covetousness of the prophet?  For whereas the
Lord has said, “Provide not gold, nor silver, nor two coats
*a-piece*,” <span id="fr_3803"></span>[3804](#fn_3803.md) these men have,
on the flat contrary, transgressed the command by the acquisition of
these forbidden things.  For we shall show that those who are called
among them prophets and martyrs obtain money not only from the rich, but
also from the poor, from orphans and widows.  And if they are confident
*that they are right* in so doing, let them stand *forward* and discuss
*the point*, in order that, if they be refuted, they may cease for the
future so to transgress.  For the fruits of the prophet must needs be
brought to the test:  for “from its fruit is the tree known.” <span
id="fr_3804"></span>[3805](#fn_3804.md)   But that those that desire it may
become acquainted with what relates to Alexander, he was condemned by
Æmilius Frontinus, proconsul at Ephesus, not on account of the name *of
Christ*, but for the daring robberies he committed when he was already a
transgressor. <span id="fr_3805"></span>[3806](#fn_3805.md)   Afterwards,
when he had spoken falsely of the name of the Lord, he was released,
having deceived the faithful there; <span
id="fr_3806"></span>[3807](#fn_3806.md) and *even the brethren of* his own
district, <span id="fr_3807"></span>[3808](#fn_3807.md) from which he came,
did not receive him, because he was a robber.  Thus, those who wish to
learn what he is, have the public treasury of Asia to go to.  And yet
the prophet, although he spent many years with him, knows *forsooth*
nothing about him!  By convicting “him,” we by his means clearly convict
of misrepresentation <span id="fr_3808"></span>[3809](#fn_3808.md) the
prophet likewise.  We are able to prove the like in the case of many
*others* besides.  And if they are confident *of their innocence*, let
them abide the test.

<span id="x.xiv-p26"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="x.xiv-p26.1"></span>V.</span>

<span id="x.xiv-p27"></span>If they deny that their prophets have taken
gifts, let them confess thus much, that if they be convicted of having
taken them, they are not prophets; and we will adduce ten thousand
proofs *that they have*.  It is proper, too, that all the fruits of a
prophet should be examined.  Tell me:  does a prophet dye *his hair?* 
Does a prophet use stibium *on his eyes?*  Is a prophet fond of dress? 
Does a prophet play at gaming-tables and dice?  Does a prophet lend
money on interest? <span id="fr_3809"></span>[3810](#fn_3809.md)   Let them
confess whether these things are allowable or not.  For my part, I will
prove that these practices have occurred among them.
