id="vi.iv.xvii.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II.—The Reason of Peter’s
Lateness.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xvii.ii-p2"></span>Then, <span
id="fr_1191"></span>[1192](#fn_1191) at length, Peter seeing that the
multitude had entered, sat down, and bidding us sit down beside him, he
related first of all why he had sent us on before him after the baptism,
and why he himself had been late in returning. <span
id="fr_1192"></span>[1193](#fn_1192)   He said that the following was
the reason:  “At the time that you came up,” <span
id="fr_1193"></span>[1194](#fn_1193) he says, “an old man, a workman,
entered along with you, concealing himself out of curiosity.  He had
watched us before, as he himself afterwards confessed, in order to see
what we were doing when we entered into the sheltered place, and then he
came out secretly and followed us.  And coming up to me at a convenient
place, and addressing me, he said, ‘For a long time I have been
following you and wishing to talk with you, but I was afraid that you
might be angry with me, as if I were instigated by curiosity; but now I
shall tell you, if you please, what I think is the truth.’  And I
replied, ‘Tell us what you think is good, and we shall approve your
conduct, even should what you say not be really good, since with a good
purpose you have been anxious to state what you deem to be good.’

<span id="vi.iv.xvii.ii-p3"></span> \[For the extensive variations in
the plan of the two narratives from this point to the end, see footnote
on *Recognitions*, viii. 1.  In the *Recognitions* the family of Clement
are brought into greater prominence as disputants; in the *Homilies*
Simon Magus, and Peter’s discourses against him, are the main features;
both, however, preserve the dramatic element of the re-united family,
though the details are given differently in the two narratives.—R.\]
