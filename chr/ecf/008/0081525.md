<span id="x.xi"></span>

<span id="x.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c6"><span
id="x.xi-p1.1"></span>Polycrates, <span
id="fr_3766"></span>[3767](#fn_3766.md) Bishop of Ephesus.</span>

<span id="x.xi-p3"></span>\[<span class="c9"><span
id="x.xi-p3.1"></span>a.d.</span> 130–196.\]  This author <span
id="fr_3767"></span>[3768](#fn_3767.md) comes in as an appendix to the
stories of Polycarp and Irenæus and good Anicetus, and his writings also
bear upon the contrast presented by the less creditable history of
Victor.  If, as I suppose, the appearance of our Lord to St. John on
“the Lord’s day” was on the Paschal Sunday, it may at first seem
surprising that this Apostle can be claimed by Polycrates in behalf of
the Eastern custom to keep Easter, with the Jews, on the fourteenth day
of the moon.  But to the Jews the Apostles became “as Jews” in all
things tolerable, so long as the Temple stood, and while the bishops of
Jerusalem were labouring to identify the Paschal Lamb with their
Passover.  The long survival of St. John among Jewish Christians led
them to prolong this usage, no doubt, as sanctioned by his example.  He
foreknew it would quietly pass away.  The wise and truly Christian
spirit of Irenæus prepared the way for the ultimate unanimity of the
Church in a matter which lies at the base of “the Christian Sabbath,”
and of our own observance of the first day of the week as a weekly
Easter.  Those who in our own times have revived the observance of the
Jewish Sabbath, show us how much may be said on their side, <span
id="fr_3768"></span>[3769](#fn_3768.md) and elucidate the tenacity of the
Easterns in resisting the abolition of the Mosaic ordinance as to the
Paschal, although they agreed to keep it “not with the old leaven.”

<span id="x.xi-p6"></span>Our author belonged to a family in which he
was the eighth Christian bishop; and he presided over the church of
Ephesus, in which the traditions of St. John were yet fresh in men’s
minds at the date of his birth.  He had doubtless known Polycarp, and
Irenæus also.  He seems to have presided over a synod of Asiatic bishops
(<span class="c9"><span id="x.xi-p6.1"></span>a.d.</span> 196) which
came together to consider this matter of the Paschal feast.  It is
surely noteworthy that nobody doubted that it was kept by a Christian
and Apostolic ordinance.  So St. Paul argues from its Christian
observance, in his rebuke of the Corinthians. <span
id="fr_3769"></span>[3770](#fn_3769.md)   They were keeping it “unleavened”
ceremonially, and he urges a spiritual unleavening as more important. 
The Christian hallowing of Pentecost connects with the Paschal
argument. <span id="fr_3770"></span>[3771](#fn_3770.md)   The Christian
Sabbath hinges on these points.

<span id="x.xi-p9"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="x.xi-p9.1"></span>From His Epistle to Victor and the Roman Church
Concerning the Day of Keeping the Passover. <span
id="fr_3771"></span>[3772](#fn_3771.md) </span>

<span id="x.xi-p11"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="x.xi-p11.1"></span>As</span> for us, then, we scrupulously observe
the exact day, <span id="fr_3772"></span>[3773](#fn_3772.md) neither adding
nor taking away.  For in Asia great luminaries <span
id="fr_3773"></span>[3774](#fn_3773.md) have gone to their rest, who shall
rise again in the day of the coming of the Lord, when He cometh with
glory from heaven and shall raise again all the saints.  *I speak of*
Philip, one of the twelve apostles, <span
id="fr_3774"></span>[3775](#fn_3774.md) who is laid to rest at Hierapolis;
and his two daughters, who arrived at old age unmarried; <span
id="fr_3775"></span>[3776](#fn_3775.md) his other daughter also, who passed
her life <span id="fr_3776"></span>[3777](#fn_3776.md) under the influence
of the Holy Spirit, and reposes at Ephesus; John, moreover, who reclined
on the Lord’s bosom, and who became a priest wearing the mitre, <span
id="fr_3777"></span>[3778](#fn_3777.md) and a witness and a teacher—he
rests at Ephesus.  Then there is Polycarp, both bishop and martyr at
Smyrna; and Thraseas from Eumenia, both bishop and <span
id="page_774">p. 774</span> <span id="x.xi-Page_774"></span>martyr, who
rests at Smyrna.  Why should I speak of Sagaris, bishop and martyr, who
rests at Laodicea? of the blessed Papirius, moreover? and of Melito the
eunuch, <span id="fr_3778"></span>[3779](#fn_3778.md) who performed all his
actions under the influence of the Holy Spirit, and lies at Sardis,
awaiting the visitation <span id="fr_3779"></span>[3780](#fn_3779.md) from
heaven, when he shall rise again from the dead?  These all kept the
passover on the fourteenth. day *of the month*, in accordance with the
Gospel, without ever deviating from it, but keeping to the rule of
faith.

<span id="x.xi-p20"></span>Moreover I also, Polycrates, who am the least
of you all, in accordance with the tradition of my relatives, some of
whom I have succeeded—seven of my relatives were bishops, and I am the
eighth, and my relatives always observed the day when the people put
away <span id="fr_3780"></span>[3781](#fn_3780.md) the leaven—I myself,
brethren, I say, who am sixty-five years old in the Lord, and have
fallen in with the brethren in all parts of the world, and have read
through all Holy Scripture, am not frightened at the things which are
said to terrify us.  For those who are greater than I have said, “We
ought to obey God rather than men.” <span
id="fr_3781"></span>[3782](#fn_3781.md) …

<span id="x.xi-p23"></span>I might also have made mention of the bishops
associated with me, whom it was your own desire to have called together
by me, and I called them together:  whose names, if I were to write them
down, would amount to a great number.  These *bishops*, on coming to see
me, unworthy as I am, <span id="fr_3782"></span>[3783](#fn_3782.md)
signified their united approval of the letter, knowing that I wore
*these* grey hairs not in vain, but have always regulated my conduct in
*obedience* to the Lord Jesus.
