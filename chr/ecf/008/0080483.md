id="vi.iii.xi.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIV.—Knowledge Deadens
Lusts.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.xi.xiv-p2"></span>“But if, while in this life, they had
placed before their eyes the punishments which they shall then suffer,
they would certainly have bridled their lusts, and would in nowise have
fallen into sin.  For the understanding in the soul has much power for
cutting off all its desires, especially when it has acquired the
knowledge of heavenly things, by means of which, having received the
light of truth, it will turn away from all darkness of evil actions. 
For as the sun obscures and conceals all the stars by the brightness of
his shining, so also the mind, by the light of knowledge, renders all
the lusts of the soul ineffective and inactive, sending out upon them
the thought of the judgment to come as its rays, so that they can no
longer appear in the soul.
