id="vi.iv.v.xxxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXIX.—Tactics.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.v.xxxix-p2"></span>“Simon, therefore, as I learn,
intends to come into public, and to speak of those chapters against God
that are added to the Scriptures, for the sake of temptation, that he
may seduce as many wretched ones as he can from the love of God.  For we
do not wish to say in public that these chapters are added to the Bible,
since we should thereby perplex the unlearned multitudes, and so
accomplish the purpose of this wicked Simon.  For they not having yet
the power of discerning, would flee from us as impious; or, as if not
only the blasphemous chapters were false, they would even withdraw from
the word.  Wherefore we are under a necessity of assenting to the false
chapters, and putting questions in return to him concerning them, to
draw him into a strait, and to give in private an explanation of the
chapters that are spoken against God to the well-disposed after a trial
of their faith; and of this there is but one way, and that a brief one. 
It is this. <span id="fr_946"></span>[947](#fn_946)
