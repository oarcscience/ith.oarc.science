id="vi.iii.vii.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.—Ignorance the Mother of
Evils.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.vii.iv-p2"></span>“From <span
id="fr_752"></span>[753](#fn_752) all these things, therefore, it is
concluded that all evil springs from ignorance; and ignorance herself,
the mother of all evils, is sprung from carelessness and sloth, and is
nourished, and increased, and rooted in the senses of men by negligence;
and if any one teach that she is to be put to flight, she is with
difficulty and indignantly torn away, as from an ancient and hereditary
abode.  And therefore we must labour for a little, that we may search
out the presumptions of ignorance, and cut them off by means of
knowledge, especially in those who are preoccupied with some erroneous
opinions, by means of which ignorance is the more firmly rooted in them,
as under the appearance of a certain kind of knowledge; for nothing is
worse than for one to believe that he knows what he is ignorant of, and
to maintain that to be true which is false.  This is as if a drunk man
should think himself to be sober, and should act indeed in all respects
as a *drunk* man, and yet think himself to be sober, and should wish to
be called so by others.  Thus, therefore, are those also who do not know
what is true, yet hold some appearance of knowledge, and do many evil
things as if they were good, and hasten destruction as if it were to
salvation.
