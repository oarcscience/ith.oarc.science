id="fr_3530"></span>[3531](#fn_3530.md) is spoken of by Eusebius as a “man
of understanding and of Apostolic faith.”  And he celebrates Aristides
as a man of similar character.  These were the earliest apologists; both
addressed their writings to Hadrian, and they were extant and valued in
the churches in the time of Eusebius.

present:  for they were real, *consisting of* those who had been healed
of their diseases, those who had been raised from the dead; who were not
only seen whilst they were being healed and raised up, but were
*afterwards* constantly present.  Nor did they remain only during the
sojourn of the Saviour *on earth*, but also a considerable time after
His departure; and, indeed, some of them have survived even down to our
own times. <span id="fr_3532"></span>[3533](#fn_3532.md)
