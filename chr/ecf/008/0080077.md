id="vi.iii.iii.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XV.—Peter’s First Instruction: 
Causes of Ignorance.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iii.xv-p2"></span>“The will and counsel of God has for
many reasons been concealed from men; first, indeed, through bad
instruction, wicked associations, evil habits, unprofitable
conversation, and unrighteous presumptions.  On account of all these, I
say, first error, then contempt, then infidelity and malice,
covetousness also, and vain boasting, and other such like evils, have
filled the whole house of this world, like some enormous smoke, and
preventing those who dwell in it from seeing its Founder aright, and
from perceiving what things are pleasing to Him.  What, then, is fitting
for those who are within, excepting with a cry brought forth from their
inmost hearts to invoke His aid, who alone is not shut up in the
smoke-filled house, that He would approach and open the door of the
house, so that the smoke may be dissipated which is within, and the
light of the sun which shines without may be admitted.”
