Cause.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xiv.x-p2"></span>“But it will be said that the cases are
not parallel between God and man; and I admit that they are not
parallel:  for the punishment is greater to him who is guilty of impiety
against the greater, and less to him who sins against the less.  As,
therefore, God is greatest of all, so he who is impious against Him
shall endure greater punishment, as sinning against the greater; not
through His defending Himself with His own hand, but the whole creation
being indignant at him, and naturally taking vengeance on him.  For to
the blasphemer the sun will not give his light, nor the earth her
fruits, nor the fountain its water, nor in Hades shall he who is there
constituted prince give rest to the soul; since even now, while the
constitution of the world subsists, the whole creation is indignant at
him.  Wherefore neither do *the clouds* afford sufficient rains, nor the
earth fruits, whereby many perish; yea, even the air itself, inflamed
with anger, is turned to pestilential courses.  However, whatsoever good
things we enjoy, He of His mercy compels the creature to our benefits. 
Still, against you who dishonour the Maker of all, the whole creation is
hostile.
