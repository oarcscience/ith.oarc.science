id="vi.iii.iv.xlv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLV.—Polytheism
Inexcusable.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iv.xlv-p2"></span>“For be sure of this, that you shall
not have us participators in this attempt; nor will we suffer ourselves
to be deceived by you.  For it will not serve us for an excuse in the
judgment, if we say that you deceived us; because neither could it
excuse the first woman, that she had unhappily believed the serpent; but
she was condemned to death, because she believed badly.  For this cause
therefore, Moses, also commending the faith of one God to the people,
says, ‘Take heed to thyself, that thou be not seduced from the Lord thy
God.’ <span id="fr_653"></span>[654](#fn_653.md)   Observe that he <span
id="page_110">p. 110</span> <span
id="vi.iii.iv.xlv-Page_110"></span>makes use of the same word which the
first woman also made use of in excusing herself, saying that she was
seduced; but it profited her nothing.  But over and above all this, even
if some true prophet should arise, who should perform signs and
miracles, but should wish to persuade us to worship other gods besides
the God of the Jews, we should never be able to believe him.  For so the
divine law has taught us, handing down a secret injunction more purely
by means of tradition, for thus it saith:  ‘If there arise among you a
prophet, or one dreaming a dream, and give you signs or wonders, and
these signs or wonders come to pass, and he say to you, Let us go and
worship strange gods, whom ye know not; ye shall not hear the words of
that prophet, nor the dream of that dreamer, because proving he hath
proved you, that he may see if ye love the Lord your God.’ <span
