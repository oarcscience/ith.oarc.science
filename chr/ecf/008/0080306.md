<span id="vi.iii.vi.xxx-p2"></span>“By a like example, other men in
other places built temples, set up statues, instituted mysteries and
ceremonies and sacrifices, to those whom they had admired, either for
some arts or for virtue, or at least had held in very great affection;
and rejoiced, by means of all things belonging to gods, to hand down
their fame to posterity; and that especially, because, as we have
already said, they seemed to be supported by some phantasies of magic
art, so that by invocation of demons something seemed to be done and
moved by them towards the deception of men.  To these they add also
certain solemnities, and drunken banquets, in which men might with all
freedom indulge; and demons, conveyed into them in the chariot of
repletion, might be mixed with their very bowels, and holding a place
there, might bind the acts and thoughts of men to their own will.  Such
errors, then, having been introduced from the beginning, and having been
aided by lust and drunkenness, in which carnal men chiefly delight, the
religion of God, which consisted in continence and sobriety, began to
become rare amongst men, and to be well-nigh abolished.
