Difference.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.viii.vii-p2"></span>“Then Appion said:  ‘Do you not
think it is the same thing, whether you obtain her by magic, or by
deceiving her with words?’  Then said I:  ‘Not altogether the same; for
these differ widely from one another.  For he who constrains an
unwilling woman by the force of magic, subjects himself to the most
terrible punishment, as having plotted against a chaste woman; but he
who persuades her with words, and puts the choice in her own power and
will, does not force her.  And I am of opinion, that he who has
persuaded *a woman* will not suffer so great punishment as he who has
forced her.  Therefore, if you can persuade her, I shall be thankful to
you when I have obtained her; but otherwise, I had rather die than force
her against her will.’
