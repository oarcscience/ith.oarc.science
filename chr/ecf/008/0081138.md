<span id="vi.iv.xxii.xix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.xxii.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIX.—Some Actions Really
Wicked.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxii.xix-p2"></span>And Peter said:  “A man ought to
punish himself through self-restraint, <span
id="fr_1449"></span>[1450](#fn_1449.md) when his lust wishes to hurry on to
the injury of another, knowing *that* <span
id="fr_1450"></span>[1451](#fn_1450.md) the wicked one can destroy the
wicked, for he has received power over them from the beginning.  And not
yet is this an evil to those who have done evil; but that their souls
should remain punished after the destruction, you are right in thinking
to be really harsh, though the man who has been fore-ordained for evil
should say that it is right. <span id="fr_1451"></span>[1452](#fn_1451.md)
  Wherefore, as I said, we ought to avoid doing injury <span
id="fr_1452"></span>[1453](#fn_1452.md) to another for the sake of a short
lived pleasure, that we may not involve ourselves in eternal punishment
for the sake of a little pleasure.”  And Simon said:  “Is it the case,
then, that there is nothing either bad or good by nature, but the
difference arises through law and custom?  *For is it not* <span
id="fr_1453"></span>[1454](#fn_1453.md) the habit of the Persians to marry
their own mothers, sisters and daughters, while marriage with other
women is prohibited <span id="fr_1454"></span>[1455](#fn_1454.md) as most
barbarous?  Wherefore, if it is not settled what things are evil, it is
not possible for all to look forward to the judgment of God.”  And Peter
said:  “This cannot hold; for it is plain to all that cohabitation with
mothers is abominable, even though the Persians, who are a mere fraction
of the whole, should under the effects of a bad custom fail to see the
iniquity of their abominable conduct.  Thus also the Britons publicly
cohabit in the sight of all, and are not ashamed; and some men eat the
flesh of others, and feel no disgust; and others eat the flesh of dogs;
and others practice other unmentionable deeds.  Thus, then we ought not
to form our judgments with a perception which through habit has been
perverted from its natural action.  For to be murdered is an evil, even
if all were to deny it; for no one wishes to suffer it himself, and in
the case of theft <span id="fr_1455"></span>[1456](#fn_1455.md) no one
rejoices at his own punishment.  If, then, no one <span
id="fr_1456"></span>[1457](#fn_1456.md) were at all ever to confess that
these are sins, it is right even then to look forward of necessity to a
judgment in regard to sins.”  When Peter said this, Simon answered: 
“Does this, then, seem to you to be the truth in regard to the wicked
one?  Tell me.”

<span id="vi.iv.xxii.xix-p5"></span> This passage is hopelessly

class="Greek"><span id="vi.iv.xxii.xix-p5.2"></span>δικαιοῖς</span>, the

<span id="vi.iv.xxii.xix-p7"></span> This is a conjectural filling up of

<span id="vi.iv.xxii.xix-p8"></span> This is partly conjecture, to fill

<span id="vi.iv.xxii.xix-p10"></span> Uhlhorn changed <span
