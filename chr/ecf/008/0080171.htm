<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.iv.xxxiv-p2"></A>Then said Simon:&#160; &#8220;I have no need to learn this from you, but how these things agree with one another.&#160; For if he shall be shown to be inconsistent, he shall be proved at the same time not to be a prophet.&#8221;&#160; Then says Peter:&#160; &#8220;But if I first show Him to be a prophet, it will follow that what seems to be inconsistency is not such.&#160; For no one can be proved to be a prophet merely by consistency, because it is possible for many to attain this; but if consistency does not make a prophet, much more inconsistency does not.&#160; Because, therefore, there are many things which to some seem inconsistent, which yet have consistency in them on a more profound investigation; as also other things which seem to have consistency, but which, being more carefully discussed, are found to be inconsistent; for this reason I do not think there is any better way to judge of these things than to ascertain in the first instance whether He be a prophet who has spoken those things which appear to be inconsistent.&#160; For it is evident that, if He be found a <A NAME="page_107"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 107</FONT></A> <a name="vi.iii.iv.xxxiv-Page_107"></A>prophet, those things which seem to be contradictory must have consistency, but are misunderstood.&#160; Concerning these things, therefore, proofs will be properly demanded.&#160; For we apostles are sent to expound the sayings and affirm the judgments of Him who has sent us; but we are not commissioned to say anything of our own, but to unfold the truth, as I have said, of His words.&#8221;</p>
