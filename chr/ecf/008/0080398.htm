<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.ix.xxxi-p2"></A>While she was yet speaking, my brothers could contain themselves no longer, but rushed into their mother&#146;s embrace with many tears, and kissed her.&#160; But she said:&#160; &#8220;What is the meaning of this?&#8221;&#160; &#8220;Then said Peter:&#160; &#8220;Be not disturbed, O woman; be firm.&#160; These are your sons Faustinus and Faustus, whom you supposed to have perished in the deep; but how they are alive, and how they escaped in that horrible night, and how the one of them is called Niceta and the other Aquila, they will be able to explain to you themselves, and we also shall hear it along with you.&#8221;&#160; When Peter had said this, our mother fainted, being overcome with excess of joy; and after some time, being restored and come to herself, she said: &#8220;I beseech you, darling sons, tell me what has befallen you since that dismal and cruel night.&#8221;</p>
