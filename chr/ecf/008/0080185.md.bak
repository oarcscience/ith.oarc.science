<span id="vi.iii.iv.xlviii-p2"></span>Then Peter says:  “You do not
perceive that you are making statements in opposition to yourself.  For
if our Jesus also knows Him whom ye call the unknown God, then He is not
known by you alone.  Yea, if our Jesus knows Him, then Moses also, who
prophesied that Jesus should come, assuredly could not himself be
ignorant of Him.  For he was a prophet; and he who prophesied of the Son
doubtless knew the Father.  For if it is in the option of the Son to
reveal the Father to whom He will, then the Son, who has been with the
Father from the beginning, and through all generations, as He revealed
the Father to Moses, so also to the other prophets; but if this be so,
it is evident that the Father has not been unknown to any of them.  But
how could the Father be revealed to you, who do not believe in the Son,
since the Father is known to none except him to whom the Son is pleased
to reveal Him?  But the Son reveals the Father to those who honour the
Son as they honour the Father.” <span id="fr_659"></span>[660](#fn_659.md)
