id="vi.iv.xiv.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.—Charming of the
Serpent.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xiv.xviii-p2"></span>“Wherefore, as to the matter in
hand, although in ten thousand ways the serpent that lurks in you
suggesting evil reasonings and hindrances, wishes to ensnare you,
therefore so much the more ought ye to resist him, and to listen to us
assiduously.  For it behoves you, consulting, as having been grievously
deceived, to know how he must be charmed.  But in no other way is it
possible.  But by charming I mean the setting yourselves by reason in
opposition to their evil counsels, remembering that by promise of
knowledge he brought death into the world at the first. <span
