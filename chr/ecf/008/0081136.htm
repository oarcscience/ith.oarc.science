<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xxii.xvii-p2"></A>And Simon said:&#160; &#8220;If, then, he exists for ever, is not the fact of the sole government <i>of God</i> thus destroyed, since there is another power, namely, that concerned with matter, which rules along with Him?&#8221;&#160; And Peter said:&#160; &#8220;If they are different in their substances, they are different also in their powers, and the superior rules the inferior.&#160; But if they are of the same substance, then they are equal in power, and they are in like manner good or bad.&#160; But it is plain that they are not equal in power; for the Creator put matter into that shape of a world into which He willed to put it.&#160; Is it then at all possible to maintain that it always existed, being a substance; and is not matter, as it were, the storehouse of God?&#160; For it is not possible to maintain that there was a time&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1442"></A><A HREF="#fn_1442"><FONT SIZE="1">1443</FONT></A>
 when God possessed nothing, but He always was the only ruler of it.&#160; Wherefore also He is an eternal sole ruler;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1443"></A><A HREF="#fn_1443"><FONT SIZE="1">1444</FONT></A>
 and on this account it would justly be said to belong to Him who exists, and rules, and is <i>eternal</i>.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1444"></A><A HREF="#fn_1444"><FONT SIZE="1">1445</FONT></A>
&#160; And Simon said:&#160; &#8220;What then?&#160; Did the wicked one make himself?&#160; And was God good in such a way, that, knowing he would be the cause of evil, he yet did not destroy him at his origination, when he could have been destroyed, as not yet being perfectly made?&#160; For if he came into being suddenly and complete, then on that account&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1445"></A><A HREF="#fn_1445"><FONT SIZE="1">1446</FONT></A>
 he is at war with the Creator, as having come suddenly into being, possessed of equal power with him.&#8221;</p>
