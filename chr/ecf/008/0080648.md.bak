id="vi.iv.v.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XV.—Pairs.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.v.xv-p2"></span>“Hence therefore God, teaching men with
respect to the truth of existing things, being Himself one, has
distinguished all principles into pairs and opposites, <span
id="fr_922"></span>[923](#fn_922.md) Himself being one and sole God from
the beginning, having made heaven and earth, day and night, light and
fire, sun and moon, life and death.  But man alone amongst these He made
self-controlling, having a fitness to be either righteous or
unrighteous.  To him also he hath varied the figures of combinations,
placing before him small things first, and great ones afterwards, such
as the world and eternity.  But the world that now is, is temporary;
that which shall be, is eternal.  First is ignorance, then knowledge. 
So also has He arranged the leaders of prophecy.  For, since the present
world is female, as a mother bringing forth the souls of her children,
but the world to come is male, as a father receiving his children *from
their mother*, therefore in this world there come a succession of
prophets, as being sons of the world to come, and having knowledge of
men.  And if pious men had understood this mystery, they would never
have gone astray, but even now they should have known that Simon, who
now enthralls all men, is a fellow-worker of error and deceit.  Now, the
doctrine of the prophetic rule is as follows.
