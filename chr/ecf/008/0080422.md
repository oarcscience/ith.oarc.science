<span id="vi.iii.x.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iii.x.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVI.—The World Made of Nothing by
a Creator.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.x.xvi-p2"></span>“But from this fact also, that in the
conjunction of the elements, if one be deficient or in excess, the
others are loosened and fall, is shown that they took their beginning
from nothing.  For if for example, moisture be wanting in any body,
neither will the dry stand; for dry is fed by moisture, as also cold by
heat; in which, as we have said, if one be defective, the whole are
dissolved.  And in this they give indications of their origin, that they
were made out of nothing.  Now if matter itself is proved to have been
made, how shall its parts and its species, of which the world consists,
be thought to be unmade?  But about matter and its qualities this is not
the time to speak:  only let it suffice to have taught this, that God is
the Creator of all things, because neither, if the body of which the
world <span id="page_170">p. 170</span> <span
id="vi.iii.x.xvi-Page_170"></span>consists was solid and united, could
it be separated and distinguished without a Creator; nor, if it was
collected into one from diverse and separate parts, could it be
collected and mixed without a Maker.  Therefore, if God is so clearly
shown to be the Creator of the world, what room is there for Epicurus to
introduce atoms, and to assert that not only sensible bodies, but even
intellectual and rational minds, are made of insensible corpuscles?
