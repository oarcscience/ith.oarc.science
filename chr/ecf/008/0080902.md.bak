id="vi.iv.xii.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIX.—Privileges of the
Baptized.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xii.xix-p2"></span>“For God is almighty.  For He is good
and righteous, now long-suffering to all, that those who will, repenting
of the evils which they have done, and living well, may receive a worthy
reward in the day in which all things are judged.  Wherefore now begin
to obey God by reason of <span id="page_279">p. 279</span> <span
id="vi.iv.xii.xix-Page_279"></span>good knowledge, <span
id="fr_1116"></span>[1117](#fn_1116.md) and to oppose your evil lusts and
thoughts, that you may be able to recover the original saving worship
which was committed to humanity.  For thus shall blessings straightway
spring up to you, which, when you receive, you will thenceforth quit the
trial of evils.  But give thanks to the Giver; being kings for ever of
unspeakable good things, with the King of peace.  But in the present
life, washing in a flowing river, or fountain, or even in the sea, with
the thrice-blessed invocation, you shall not only be able to drive away
the spirits which lurk in you; but yourselves no longer sinning, and
undoubtingly believing God, you shall drive out evil spirits and dire
demons, with terrible diseases, from others.  And sometimes they shall
flee when you but look on them.  For they know those who have given
themselves up to God.  Wherefore, honouring them, they flee affrighted,
as you saw yesterday, how, when after the address I delayed praying for
those who were suffering these maladies, through respect towards the
worship they cried out, not being able to endure it for a short hour.
