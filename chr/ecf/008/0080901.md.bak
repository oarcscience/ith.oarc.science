<span id="vi.iv.xii.xviii-p2"></span>“And how many also falsify the
responses given and the cures effected by them, and confirm them with an
oath!  And how many give themselves up to them for hire, undertaking
falsely to suffer certain things, and thus proclaiming their suffering,
and being restored by remedial means, they say that they oracularly
promised them healing, in order that they may assign as the cause the
senseless worship!  And how many of these things were formerly done by
magical art, in the way of interpreting dreams, and divining!  Yet in
course of time these things have disappeared.  And how many are there
now, who, wishing to obtain such things, make use of charms!  However,
though a thing be prophetical or healing, it is not divine.
