<span id="vi.iv.xv.xiv-p2"></span>Then said Peter, “What then?  Do you
suppose, O woman, that those who destroy themselves are freed from
punishment?  Are not the souls of those who thus die punished with a
worse punishment in Hades for their suicide?”  But she said, “Would that
I were persuaded that souls are really found alive in Hades; then I
should love death, making light of the punishment, that I might see,
were it but for an hour, my longed for sons!”  Then said Peter, “What is
it that grieves you?  I should like to know, O woman.  For if you inform
me, in return for this favour, I shall satisfy you that souls live in
Hades; and instead of precipice or pool, I shall give you a drug, that
you may live and die without torment.”
