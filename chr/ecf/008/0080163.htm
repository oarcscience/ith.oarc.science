<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.iv.xxvi-p2"></A>When therefore Peter had begun to continue his discourse, Simon, interrupting his speech, said:&#160; &#8220;Why do you hasten to speak whatever you please?&#160; I understand your tricks.&#160; You wish to bring forward those matters whose explanation you have well studied, that you may appear to the ignorant crowd to be speaking well; but I shall not allow you this subterfuge.&#160; Now therefore, since you promise, as a brave man, to answer to all that any one chooses to bring forward, be pleased to answer me in the first place.&#8221;&#160; Then Peter said:&#160; &#8220;I am ready, only provided that our discussion may be with peace.&#8221;&#160; Then Simon said:&#160; &#8220;Do not you see, O simpleton, that in pleading for peace you act in opposition to your Master, and that what you propose is not suitable to him who promises that he will overthrow ignorance?&#160; Or, if you are right in asking peace from the audience, then your Master was wrong in saying, &#145;I have not come to send peace on earth, but a sword.&#146;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_618"></A><A HREF="#fn_618"><FONT SIZE="1">619</FONT></A>
&#160; For either you say well, and he not well; or else, if your Master <A NAME="page_105"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 105</FONT></A> <a name="vi.iii.iv.xxvi-Page_105"></A>said well, then you not at all well:&#160; for you do not understand that your statement is contrary to his, whose disciple you profess yourself to be.&#8221;</p>
