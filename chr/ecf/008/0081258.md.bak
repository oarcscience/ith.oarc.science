id="vii.xii.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 5.</span>

<span id="vii.xii.vi-p2"></span>And one Nicodemus, a Jew, stood before
the procurator, and said:  I beseech your honour, let me say a few
words.  Pilate says:  Say on.  Nicodemus says:  I said to the elders and
the priests and Levites, and to all the multitude of the Jews in the
synagogue, What do you seek to do with this man?  This man does many
miracles and strange things, which no one has done or will do.  Let him
go, and do not wish any evil against him.  If the miracles which he does
are of God, they will stand; but if man, they will come to
nothing. <span id="fr_1821"></span>[1822](#fn_1821.md)   For assuredly
Moses, being sent by God into Egypt, did many miracles, which the Lord
commanded him to do before Pharaoh king of Egypt.  And there were there
Jannes and Jambres, servants of Pharaoh, and they also did not a few of
the miracles which Moses did; and the Egyptians took them to be
gods—this Jannes and this Jambres. <span
id="fr_1822"></span>[1823](#fn_1822.md)   But, since the miracles which
they did were not of God, both they and those who believed in them were
destroyed.  And now release this man, for he is not deserving of death.

<span id="vii.xii.vi-p5"></span>The Jews say to Nicodemus:  Thou hast
become his disciple, and therefore thou defendest him.  Nicodemus says
to them:  Perhaps, too, the procurator has become his disciple, because
he defends him.  Has the emperor not appointed him to this place of
dignity?  And the Jews were vehemently enraged, and gnashed their teeth
against Nicodemus.  Pilate says to them:  Why do you gnash your teeth
against him when you hear the truth?  The Jews say to Nicodemus:  Mayst
thou receive his truth and his portion.  Nicodemus says:  Amen, amen;
may I receive it, as you have said.
