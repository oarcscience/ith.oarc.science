id="vi.iii.iv.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIII.—Simon Refuses
Peace.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iv.xxiii-p2"></span>To this Simon answered: <span
id="fr_617"></span>[618](#fn_617.md)   “We have no need of your peace; for
if there be peace and con<span id="page_104">p. 104</span> <span
id="vi.iii.iv.xxiii-Page_104"></span>cord, we shall not be able to make
any advance towards the discovery of truth.  For robbers and debauchees
have peace among themselves, and every wickedness agrees with itself;
and if we have met with this view, that for the sake of peace we should
give assent to all that is said, we shall confer no benefit upon the
hearers; but, on the contrary, we shall impose upon them, and shall
depart friends.  Wherefore, do not invoke peace, but rather battle,
which is the mother of peace; and if you can, exterminate errors.  And
do not seek for friendship obtained by unfair admissions; for this I
would have you know, above all, that when two fight with each other,
then there will be peace when one has been defeated and has fallen.  And
therefore fight as best you can, and do not expect peace without war,
which is impossible; or if it can be attained, show us how.”

arguments are, in the main, those given in chap. 39 of this book. 
Chaps. 23–36 are without a direct parallel in the *Homilies*.—R.\]
