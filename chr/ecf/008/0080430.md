<span id="vi.iii.x.xxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iii.x.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIV.—Rivers and Seas.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.x.xxiv-p2"></span>“What shall we say of fountains and
rivers, which flow with perpetual motion into the sea?  And, by the
divine providence, neither does their abundant supply fail, nor does the
sea, though it receives so great quantities of water, experience any
increase, but both those elements which contribute to it and those which
are thus contributed <span id="page_172">p. 172</span> <span
id="vi.iii.x.xxiv-Page_172"></span>remain in the same proportion.  But
you will say to me:  The salt water naturally consumes the fresh water
which is poured into it.  Well, in this is manifest the work of
providence, that it made that element salt into which it turned the
courses of all the waters which it had provided for the use of men.  So
that through so great spaces of time the channel of the sea has not been
filled, and produced a deluge destructive to the earth and to men.  Nor
will any one be so foolish as to think that this so great reason and so
great providence has been arranged by irrational nature.
