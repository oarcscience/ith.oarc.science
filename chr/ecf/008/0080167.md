Peace.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iv.xxx-p2"></span>“In like manner, also, during the
last period of His teaching, He wages war against the scribes and
Pharisees, charging them with evil deeds and unsound doctrine, and with
hiding the key of knowledge which they had handed down to them from
Moses, by which the gate of the heavenly kingdom might be opened. <span
id="fr_623"></span>[624](#fn_623)   But when our Master sent us forth to
preach, He commanded us, that into whatsoever city or house we should
enter, we should say, ‘Peace be to this house.’  ‘And if,’ said He, ‘a
son of peace be there, your peace shall come upon him; but if there be
not, your peace shall return to you.’  Also that, going out from that
house or city, we should shake off upon them the very dust which adhered
to our feet.  ‘But it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and
Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city or house.’ <span
id="fr_624"></span>[625](#fn_624)   This indeed He <span
id="page_106">p. 106</span> <span
id="vi.iii.iv.xxx-Page_106"></span>commanded to be done at length, if
first the word of truth be preached in the city or house, whereby they
who receive the faith of the truth may become sons of peace and sons of
God; and those who will not receive it may be convicted as enemies of
peace and of God.”
