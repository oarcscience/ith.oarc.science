id="vi.iv.xi.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIV.—Their Discoveries.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xi.xiv-p2"></span>“For after the intercourse, being
asked to show what they were before, and being no longer able to do so,
on account of their being unable to do aught else after their
defilement, yet wishing to please their mistresses, instead of
themselves, they showed the bowels <span
id="fr_1099"></span>[1100](#fn_1099) of the earth; I mean, the choice
metals, <span id="fr_1100"></span>[1101](#fn_1100) gold, brass, silver,
iron, and the like, with all the most precious stones.  And along with
these charmed stones, they delivered the arts of the things pertaining
to each, and imparted the discovery of magic, and taught astronomy, and
the powers of roots, and whatever was impossible to be found out by the
human mind; also the melting of gold and silver, and the like, and the
various dyeing of garments.  And all things, in short, which are for the
adornment and delight of women, are the discoveries of these demons
bound in flesh.
