<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.x.vi-p2"></A>When Niceta had thus spoken, those who had assembled conversed among themselves:&#160; &#8220;Is this that Peter of whom we heard, the most approved disciple of Him who appeared in Jud&aelig;a, and wrought many signs and miracles?&#8221;&#160; And they stood gazing upon him with great fear and veneration, as conferring upon the Lord the honour of His good servant.&#160; Which when Peter observed, he said to them:&#160; &#8220;Let us hear with all attention, holding an impartial judgment of what shall be said by each; and after their encounter we also shall add what may seem necessary.&#8221;&#160; And when Peter had said this, the crowds rejoiced.&#160; Then Niceta began to speak as follows:&#160; &#8220;You have laid down, my father, that the world is not governed by the providence of God, but that all things are subject to <i>genesis</i>, whether the things which relate to the dispositions, or those which relate to the doings of every one.&#160; This I could answer immediately; but because it is right to observe order, we also lay down what we hold, as you yourself requested should be done.&#160; I say that the world is governed by the providence of God, at least in those things which need His government.&#160; For He it is alone who holds all things in His hand, who also made the world; the just God, who shall at some time render to every one according to his deeds.&#160; Now, then, you have our position; go on as you please, either overthrowing mine or establishing your own, that I may meet your statements.&#160; Or if you wish me to speak first, I shall not hesitate.&#8221;</p>
