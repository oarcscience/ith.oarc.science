<span id="x.v.iii-p2"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="x.v.iii-p2.1"></span>From the Discourse on Soul and Body. <span
id="fr_3588"></span>[3589](#fn_3588.md) </span>

<span id="x.v.iii-p4"></span>For this reason did the Father send His Son
from heaven without a bodily form, that, when He should put on a body by
means of the Virgin’s womb, and be born man, He might save man, and
gather together those members of His which death had scattered when he
divided man.

<span id="x.v.iii-p5"></span>*And further on:*—The earth shook, and its
foundations trembled; the sun fled away, and the elements turned back,
and the day was changed *into night:*  for they could not endure *the
sight of* their Lord hanging on a tree.  The *whole* creation was
amazed, marvelling and saying, “What new mystery, then, is this?  The
Judge is judged, and holds his peace; the Invisible One is seen, and is
not ashamed; the Incomprehensible is laid hold upon, and is not
indignant; the Illimitable is circumscribed, and doth not resist; the
Impossible suffereth, and doth not avenge; the Immortal dieth, and
answereth not a word; the Celestial is laid in the grave, and endureth! 
What new mystery is this?”  The *whole* creation, *I say*, was
astonished; but, when our Lord arose from the place of the dead, and
trampled death under foot, and bound the strong one, and set man free,
then did the whole creation see clearly that for man’s sake the Judge
was condemned, and the Invisible was seen, and the Illimitable was
circumscribed, and the Impassible suffered, and the Immortal died, and
the Celestial was laid in the gave.  For our Lord, when He was born man,
was condemned in order that He might show mercy, was bound in order that
He might loose, was seized in order that He might release, suffered in
order that He might feel compassion, <span
id="fr_3589"></span>[3590](#fn_3589.md) died in order that He might give
life, was laid in the grave that He might raise *from the dead*. <span
