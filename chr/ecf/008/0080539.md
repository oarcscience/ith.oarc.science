<span id="vi.iii.xii.xxxi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iii.xii.xxxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXI.—Hesiod’s
Cosmogony.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.xii.xxxi-p2"></span>“But to this Hesiod adds, that
after chaos the heaven and the earth were made immediately, from which
he says that those eleven were produced (and sometimes also he speaks of
them as twelve) of whom he makes six males and five females.  And these
are the names that he gives to the males:  Oceanus, Cœus, Crius,
Hyperion, Iapetus, Chronos, who is also called Saturn.  Also the names
of the females are:  Theia, Rhea, Themis, Mnemosyne, Tethys. <span
id="fr_868"></span>[869](#fn_868.md)   And these names they thus interpret
allegorically.  They say that the number is eleven or twelve:  that the
first is nature itself, which also they would have to be called Rhea,
from <span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iii.xii.xxxi-p3.1"></span>Flowing</span>; and they say that the
other ten are her accidents, which also they call qualities; yet they
add a twelfth, namely Chronos, who with us is called Saturn, and him
they take to be time. <span id="fr_869"></span>[870](#fn_869.md)  
Therefore they assert that Saturn and Rhea are time and matter; and
these, when they are mixed with moisture and dryness, heat and cold,
produce all things.
