id="vi.iv.xix.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXI.—Simon Promises to Appeal to
the Teaching of Christ.  Peter Dismisses the Multitudes.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xix.xxi-p2"></span>When Peter said this, Simon
answered:  “Since I see you skilfully hinting that what is written in
the books <span id="fr_1309"></span>[1310](#fn_1309) against the
framer <span id="fr_1310"></span>[1311](#fn_1310) *of the world* does
not happen to be true, to-morrow I shall show, from the discourses of
your teacher, that he asserted that the framer *of the world* was not
the highest God.”  And when Simon said this, he went out.  But Peter
said to the assembled multitudes:  “If Simon can do no other injury to
us in regard to God, he at least prevents you from listening to the
words that can purify the soul.”  On Peter saying this, much whispering
arose amongst the crowds, saying, “What necessity is there for
permitting him to come in here, and utter his blasphemies against God?” 
And Peter heard, and said, “Would that the doctrines against God which
are intended to try men <span id="fr_1311"></span>[1312](#fn_1311) went
no further than Simon!  For there will be, as the Lord said, false
apostles, false prophets, <span id="fr_1312"></span>[1313](#fn_1312)
heresies, desires for supremacy, who, as I conjecture, finding their
beginning in Simon, who blasphemes God, will work together in the
assertion of the same opinions against God as those of Simon.”  And
saying this with tears, he summoned the multitudes to him by his hand;
and when they came, he laid his hands upon them and prayed, and then
dismissed them, telling them to come at an earlier hour next day. 
Saying this, and groaning, he entered and went to sleep, without taking
food.
