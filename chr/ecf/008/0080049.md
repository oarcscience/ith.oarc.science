<span id="v.iv.x-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter X.—David’s Sin, So Admonitory to Us Weak
Men.</span>

<span id="v.iv.x-p2"></span>Does not the case of David instruct thee,
whom God “found a man after His heart,” <span
id="fr_476"></span>[477](#fn_476.md) one faithful, faultless, pious, true? 
This same man saw the beauty of a woman—I mean of Bathsheba—when he saw
her as she was cleansing herself and washing unclothed.  This woman the
holy man saw, and was thoroughly <span id="fr_477"></span>[478](#fn_477.md)
captivated with desire by the sight of her. <span
id="fr_478"></span>[479](#fn_478.md)   See, then, what evils he committed
because of a woman, and *how* this righteous man sinned, and gave
command that the husband of this woman should be killed in battle.  Ye
have seen what wicked schemes he laid and executed, and *how*, because
of his passion for a woman, he perpetrated a murder—*he*, David, who was
called “the anointed of the Lord.” <span
id="fr_479"></span>[480](#fn_479.md)   Be admonished, O man:  for, if such
men as these have been brought to ruin through women, what is *thy*
righteousness, or what art thou among the holy, that thou consortest
with women and with maidens day and night, with much silliness, without
fear of God?  Not *thus*, my brethren, not thus let us conduct
ourselves; but let us be mindful of that word which is spoken concerning
a woman:  “Her hands lay snares, and her heart spreadeth nets; but the
just shall escape from her, whilst the wicked falleth into her
hands.” <span id="fr_480"></span>[481](#fn_480.md)   Therefore let us, who
are consecrated, <span id="fr_481"></span>[482](#fn_481.md) be careful not
to live in the same house with females who have taken the vow.  For such
conduct as this is not becoming nor right for the servants of God.
