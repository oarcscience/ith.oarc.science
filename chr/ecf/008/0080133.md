<span id="vi.iii.iii.lxxi-p2"></span>“But our friends lifted him up, for
they were both more numerous and more powerful than the others; but,
from their fear of God, they rather suffered themselves to be killed by
an inferior force, than they would kill others.  But when the evening
came the priests shut up the temple, and we returned to the house of
James, and spent the night there in prayer.  Then before daylight we
went down to Jericho, to the number of 5000 men.  Then after three days
one of the brethren came to us from Gamaliel, whom we mentioned before,
bringing to us secret tidings that that enemy had received a commission
from Caiaphas, the chief priest, that he should arrest all who believed
in Jesus, and should go to Damascus with his letters, and that there
also, employing the help of the unbelievers, he should make havoc among
the faithful; and that he was hastening to Damascus chiefly on this
account, because he believed that Peter had fled thither. <span
id="fr_596"></span>[597](#fn_596.md)   And about thirty days thereafter he
stopped on his way while passing through Jericho going to Damascus.  At
that time we were absent, having gone out to the sepulchres of two
brethren which were whitened of themselves every year, by which miracle
the fury of many against us was restrained, because they saw that our
brethren were had in remembrance before God.”
