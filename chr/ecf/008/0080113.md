<span id="vi.iii.iii.li-p2"></span>“Him, therefore, has God appointed in
the end of the world; because it was impossible that the evils of men
could be removed by any other, provided that the nature of the human
race were to remain entire, i.e., the liberty of the will being
preserved.  This condition, therefore, being preserved inviolate, He
came to invite to His kingdom all righteous ones, and those who have
been desirous to please Him.  For these He has prepared unspeakable good
things, and the heavenly city Jerusalem, which shall shine above the
brightness of the sun, for the habitation of the saints.  But the
unrighteous, and the wicked and those who have despised God, and have
devoted the life given them to diverse wickednesses, and have given to
the practice of evil the time which was given them for the work of
righteousness He shall hand over to fitting and condign vengeance.  But
the rest of the things which shall then be done, it is neither in the
power of angels nor of men to tell or to describe.  This only it is
enough for us to know, that God shall confer upon the good an eternal
possession of good things.”
