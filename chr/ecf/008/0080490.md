<span id="vi.iii.xi.xxi-p2"></span>“And that those who study mathematics
may not have it in their power to use that subterfuge by which they say
that there are certain districts of heaven to which it is granted to
have some things peculiar to themselves, some of that nation of Persians
have gone to foreign countries, who are called Magusæi, of whom there
are some to this day in Media, others in Parthia, some also in Egypt,
and a considerable number in Galatia and Phrygia, all of whom maintain
the form of this incestuous tradition without variation, and hand it
down to their posterity to be observed, even although they have changed
their district of heaven; nor has Venus with the Moon in the confines
and houses of Saturn, with <span id="page_188">p. 188</span> <span

compelled them to have a <span class="c9"><span

<span id="vi.iii.xi.xxi-p3"></span> This is a literal translation of
text.  If we read *genesi* for *genesim*, we get:  “nor has Venus, etc.,
compelled them to keep up this custom in the midst of others through the
force of *genesis.*”  Eusebius reads:  “And assuredly Venus, etc., is
not found in the *genesis* of all of them.”
