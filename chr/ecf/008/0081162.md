<span id="vi.iv.xxiii.xvii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.xxiii.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVII.—Annubion’s Services to
Faustus.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxiii.xvii-p2"></span>“And while he stated this
beforehand, I said, ‘What, then, is the advantage you now expect to get
from such a contrivance?’  And Simon said, ‘First, those who seek me,
when they apprehend him, will give up the search after me.  But if he be
executed by the hand of the emperor, very great sorrow will fall upon
his children, who left me, and fleeing *to Peter*, now aid him in his
work.’  And now, Peter, I confess the truth to you:  I was prevented by
fear *of Simon* from informing *Fau*stus of this.  But Simon did not
give us an opportunity for private conversation, *lest* some one of us
might reveal <span id="fr_1532"></span>[1533](#fn_1532.md) to him the
wicked design of Simon.  Simon then rose up in the middle of the night
and fled to Judæa, convoyed by Appion and Athenodorus.  Then I pretended
that I was sick, in order that, remaining after they had gone, I might
make Faustus go back immediately to his own people, if by any chance he
might be able, by being concealed with you, to escape observation, lest,
being caught as Simon by those who were in search of Simon, he might be
put to death through the wrath of the emperor.  At the dead of night,
therefore, I sent him away to you; and in my anxiety for him I came by
night to see him, with the intention of returning before those who
convoyed Simon should return.”  And looking to us, he said:  “I,
Annubion, see the true shape of your father; for I was anointed, as I
related to you before, by Simon himself, that the true shape of Faustus
might be seen by my eyes.  Astonished, therefore, I exceedingly wonder
at the magic power of Simon, in that standing <span
id="fr_1533"></span>[1534](#fn_1533.md) you do not recognise your own
father.”  And while our father and our mother and we ourselves wept on
account of the calamity common to all of us, Annubion also through
sympathy wept with us.

<span id="vi.iv.xxiii.xvii-p4"></span> We should have expected “standing
near” or something similar, as Weiseler remarks; but the Latin of the
*Recognitions* agrees with the Greek in having the simple “standing.”
