id="vi.iii.v.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVI.—No Goodness Without
Liberty.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.v.xvi-p2"></span>To this Simon answered:  “Was not He
able to make us all such that we should be good, and that we should not
have it in our power to be otherwise?”  Peter answered:  “This also is
an absurd question.  For if He had made us of an unchangeable nature and
incapable of being moved away from good, we should not be really good,
because we could not be aught else; and it would not be of our purpose
that we were good; and what we did would not be ours, but of the
necessity of our nature. <span id="fr_683"></span>[684](#fn_683)   But
how can that be called good which is not done of purpose?  And on this
account the world required long periods, until the number of souls which
were predestined to fill it should be completed, and then that visible
heaven should be folded up like a scroll, and that which is higher
should appear, and the souls of the blessed, being restored to their
bodies, should be ushered into light; but the souls of the wicked, for
their impure actions being surrounded with fiery spirit, should be
plunged into the abyss of unquenchable fire, to endure punishments
through eternity.  Now that these things are so, the true Prophet. has
testified to us; concerning whom, if you wish to know that He is a
prophet, I shall instruct you by innumerable declarations.  For of those
things which were spoken by Him, even now everything that He said is
being fulfilled; and those things which He spoke with respect to the
future are believed to be about to be fulfilled, for faith is given to
the future from those things which have already come to pass.”
