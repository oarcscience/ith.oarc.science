id="vi.iii.x.li-p1.1"></span>Chapter LI.—Evils Brought in by Sin.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.x.li-p2"></span>“But by the freedom of the will, every
man, while he is unbelieving in regard to things to come, by evil deeds
runs into evils.  And these are the things in the world which seem to be
done contrary to order, which owe their existence to unbelief. 
Therefore the dispensation of divine providence is withal to be admired,
which granted to those men in the beginning, walking in the good way of
life, to enjoy incorruptible good things; but when they sinned, they
gave birth to evil by sin.  And to every good thing evil is joined as by
a certain covenant of alliance on the part of sin, since indeed the
earth has been polluted with human blood, and altars have been lighted
to demons, and they have polluted the very air by the filthy smoke of
sacrifices; and so at length the elements, being first corrupted, have
handed over to men the fault of their corruption, as roots *communicate
their qualities* to the branches and the fruit.
