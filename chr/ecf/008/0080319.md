id="vi.iii.vii.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V.—Advantages of Knowledge.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.vii.v-p2"></span>“Wherefore we must, above all things,
hasten to the knowledge of the truth, that, as with a light kindled
thereat, we may be able to dispel the darkness of errors:  for
ignorance, as we have said, is a great evil; but because it has no
substance, it is easily dispelled by those who are in earnest.  For
ignorance is nothing else than not knowing what is good for us; once
know this, and ignorance perishes.  Therefore the knowledge of truth
ought to be eagerly sought after; and no one can confer it except the
true Prophet.  For this is the gate of life to those who will enter, and
the road of good works to those going to the city of salvation.
