id="vi.iii.ix.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII.—Excursion to Aradus.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.ix.xii-p2"></span>After this, one of those present
began to ask Peter, that early next day we should go to a neighbouring
island called Aradus, which was not more than six furlongs off, to see a
certain wonderful work that was in it, viz. vine-wood <span
id="fr_792"></span>[793](#fn_792) columns of immense size.  To this
Peter assented, as he was very complaisant; but he charged us that, when
we left the ship, we should not rush all together to see it:  “for,”
said he, “I do not wish you to be noticed by the crowd.”  When
therefore, next day, we reached the island by ship in the course of an
hour, forthwith we hastened to the place where the wonderful columns
were.  They were placed in a certain temple, in which there were very
magnificent works of Phidias, on which every one of us gazed earnestly.
