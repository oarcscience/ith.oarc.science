<p class="c21"><a name="vii.xii.xiv-p2"></A>And while they were still sitting in the synagogue, and wondering about Joseph, there come some of the guard whom the Jews had begged of Pilate to guard the tomb of Jesus, that His disciples might not come and steal Him.&#160; And they reported to the rulers of the synagogue, and the priests and the Levites, what had happened:&#160; how there had been a great earthquake; and we saw an angel coming down from heaven, and he rolled away the stone from the mouth of the tomb, and sat upon it; and he shone like snow, and like lightning.&#160; And we were very much afraid, and lay like dead men; and we heard the voice of the angel saying to the women who remained beside the tomb, Be not afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified.&#160; He is not here:&#160; He is risen, as He said.&#160; Come, see the place where the Lord lay:&#160; and go quickly, and tell His disciples that He is risen from the dead, and is in Galilee.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1841"></A><A HREF="#fn_1841"><FONT SIZE="1">1842</FONT></A>

<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xii.xiv-p5"></A>And when the Jews heard these words, they were very much afraid, and said:&#160; We must take care lest this story be heard, and all incline to Jesus.&#160; And the Jews called a council, and paid down a considerable sum of money, and gave it to the soldiers, saying:&#160; Say, while we slept, his disciples came by night and stole him; and if this come to the ears of the procurator, we shall persuade him, and keep you out of trouble.&#160; And they took it, and said as they had been instructed.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1842"></A><A HREF="#fn_1842"><FONT SIZE="1">1843</FONT></A>

<p class="endnote"><a name="vii.xii.xiv-p6"></A> Three of the Latin versions say:&#160; And they took the money, but could not hide the truth.&#160; For they wanted to say, His disciples stole him while we slept, and could not utter it; but said, Truly the Lord Jesus Christ has risen from the dead; and we saw an angel of God coming down from heaven, and he rolled back the stone, and sat on it.&#160; And this saying has been spread abroad among the Jews even to this day.</p>
