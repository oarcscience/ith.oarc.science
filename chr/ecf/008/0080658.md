id="vi.iv.v.xxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXV.—Simon’s Deceit.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.v.xxv-p2"></span>“But Simon is going about in company
with Helena, and even till now, as you see, is stirring up the people. 
And he says that he has brought down this Helena from the highest
heavens to the world; being queen, as the all-bearing being, and wisdom,
for whose sake, says he, the Greeks and barbarians fought, having before
their eyes but an image of truth; <span
id="fr_937"></span>[938](#fn_937.md) for she, who really is the truth, was
then with the chiefest god.  Moreover, by cunningly explaining certain
things of this sort, made up from Grecian myths, he deceives many;
especially as he performs many signal marvels, so that if we did not
know that he does these things by magic, we ourselves should also have
been deceived.  But whereas we were his fellow-labourers at the first,
so long as he did such things without doing wrong to the interests of
religion; now that he has madly begun to attempt to deceive those who
are religious, we have withdrawn from him.

<span id="vi.iv.v.xxv-p3"></span> We have here an allusion to the
tradition that it was only an image of Helen that was taken to Troy, and
not the real Helen herself.
