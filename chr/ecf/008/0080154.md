id="vi.iii.iv.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVII.—Men Enemies to God.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iv.xvii-p2"></span>“But, inasmuch as inborn affection
towards God the Creator seemed to suffice for salvation to those who
loved Him, the enemy studies to pervert this affection in men, and to
render them hostile and ungrateful to their Creator.  For I call heaven
and earth to witness, that if God permitted the enemy to rage as much as
he desires, all men should have perished long ere now; but for His
mercy’s sake God doth not suffer him.  But if men would turn their
affection towards God, all would doubtless be saved, even if for some
faults they might seem to be corrected for righteousness.  But now the
most of men have been made enemies of God, whose hearts the wicked one
has entered, and has turned aside towards himself the affection which
God the Creator had implanted in them, that they might have it towards
Him.  But of the rest, who seemed for a time to be watchful, the enemy,
appearing in a phantasy of glory and splendour, and promising them
certain great and mighty things, has caused their mind and heart to
wander away from God; yet it is for some just reason that he is
permitted to accomplish these things.”
