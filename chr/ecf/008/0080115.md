id="vi.iii.iii.liii-p1.1"></span>Chapter LIII.—Animosity of the
Jews.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iii.liii-p2"></span>“Wherefore there is not the least
doubt concerning Christ; and all the unbelieving Jews are stirred up
with boundless rage against us, fearing lest haply He against whom they
have sinned should be He.  And their fear grows all the greater, because
they know that, as soon as they fixed Him on the cross, the whole world
showed sympathy with Him; and that His body, although they guarded it
with strict care, could nowhere be found; and that innumerable
multitudes are attaching themselves to His faith.  Whence they, together
with the high priest Caiaphas, were compelled to send to us again and
again, that an inquiry might be instituted concerning the truth of His
name.  And when they were constantly entreating that they might either
learn or teach concerning Jesus, whether He were the Christ, it seemed
good to us to go up into the temple, and in the presence of all the
people to bear witness concerning Him, and at the same time to charge
the Jews with many foolish things which they were doing.  For the people
was now divided into many parties, ever since the days of John the
Baptist.”
