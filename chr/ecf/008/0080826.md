id="vi.iv.ix.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—Pallas and Hera.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.ix.viii-p2"></span>“And this, when it had reached the
summit of the æther, was devoured by it (moisture being mixed with heat,
so to say); and causing in it that ceaseless palpitation, it begat
intelligence, which they call Pallas from this palpitating (<span
class="c9"><span
id="vi.iv.ix.viii-p2.1"></span>pallesthai</span>). <span
id="fr_1068"></span>[1069](#fn_1068.md)   And this is artistic wisdom, by
which the ætherial artificer wrought out the whole world.  And from
all-pervading Zeus, that is, from this very hot æther, air (<span
class="c9"><span id="vi.iv.ix.viii-p3.1"></span>aer</span>) extends all
the way to our earth; and this they call Hera.  Wherefore, because it
has come below the æther, which is the purest substance (just as a
woman, as regards purity, is inferior), when the two were compared to
see which was the better, she was rightly regarded as the sister of
Zeus, in respect of her origin from the same substance, but as his
spouse, as being inferior like a wife.
