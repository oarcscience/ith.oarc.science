<span id="viii.viii.iii.v-p2"></span>Of the case of any one bringing
forward a charge in passion, or failing to prove his allegations.

<span id="viii.viii.iii.v-p3"></span>If, then, any one in passion brings
a charge rashly against any one, mere abuse is not to be taken for an
accusation.  But a certain time being allowed for dealing with the
matter, the person should profess his ability in writing to prove what
he has alleged in passion; so that, if he should happen to think better
of the things he uttered in passion, and decline to repeat or write
them, the person may not be held as charged with the crime.  Every one,
therefore, who adduces a charge, ought to state in writing his ability
to prove it.  And, indeed, a cause should always be dealt with in the
place where the charge is admitted; and the man who fails to
substantiate his allegation, should himself bear the penalty which he
advanced.
