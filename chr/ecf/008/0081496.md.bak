<span id="x.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c6"><span
id="x.iv-p1.1"></span>Aristo of Pella.</span>

<span id="x.iv-p2"></span>\[<span class="c9"><span
id="x.iv-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> 140.\]  Aristo of Pella <span
id="fr_3533"></span>[3534](#fn_3533.md) is supposed to have been a Jew,
whose work was designed to help the failing Judaism of his country. 
Though his work is lost, alike the original and the Latin translation of
one “Celsus,” it seems to have been a popular tract among Christians of
Cyprian’s time, and the Latin preface is often suffixed to editions of
that Father.

<span id="x.iv-p4"></span>The work of Aristo is known as the
*Disputation of Papiscus and Jason*, and Celsus tells us that Jason was
a Hebrew Christian, while his opponent was a Jew of Alexandria.  Now,
Papiscus owns himself convinced by the arguments of Jason, and concludes
by a request to be baptized.  Celsus, who seems to have been a heathen
or an Epicurean, derides the work with scornful commiseration; but
Origen rebukes this, and affirms his respect for the work.  All this
considered, one must think Aristo was “almost persuaded to be a
Christian,” and deserves a place among Christian writers.

<span id="x.iv-p5"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="x.iv-p5.1"></span>From the Disputation of Jason and Papiscus.</span>

<span id="x.iv-p6"></span>“<span class="c9"><span
id="x.iv-p6.1"></span>I remember</span>,” says Jerome (*Comm. ad Gal.*,
cap. iii. comm. 13), “in the *Dispute between Jason and Papiscus*, which
is composed in Greek, to have found it written:  ‘The execration of God
is he that is hanged.’”

<span id="x.iv-p7"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="x.iv-p7.1"></span>From the Same Work.</span>

<span id="x.iv-p8"></span>Jerome likewise, in his *Hebrew Questions on
Genesis*, says:  “*In the beginning God made the heaven and the earth*. 
The majority believe, as it is affirmed also in the *Dispute between
Jason and Papiscus*, and as Tertullian in his book <span
id="page_750">p. 750</span> <span id="x.iv-Page_750"></span>*Against
Praxeas* contends, and as Hilarius too, in his exposition of one of the
Psalms, declares, that in the Hebrew it is:  ‘In the Son, God made the
heaven and the earth.’  But that this is false, the nature of the case
itself proves.”

<span id="x.iv-p9"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="x.iv-p9.1"></span>Perhaps from the Same Work.</span>

<span id="x.iv-p10"></span>…And when the man himself <span
id="fr_3534"></span>[3535](#fn_3534.md) who had instigated them <span
id="fr_3535"></span>[3536](#fn_3535.md) to this folly had paid the just
penalty (says Eusebius, *Hist.*, iv. 6), “the whole nation from that
time was strictly forbidden to set foot on the region about Jerusalem,
by the formal decree and enactment of Adrian, who commanded that they
should not even from a distance look on their native soil!”  So writes
Aristo of Pella.

<span id="x.iv-p13"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="x.iv-p13.1"></span>From the Same Work.</span>

<span id="x.iv-p14"></span>I have found this expression *Seven heavens*
(says Maximus, in *Scholia on the work concerning the Mystical
Theology*, ascribed to Dionysius the Areopagite, cap. i.) also in the
*Dispute between Papiscus and Jason*, written by Aristo of Pella, which
Clement of Alexandria, in the sixth book of the *Outlines*, <span
id="fr_3536"></span>[3537](#fn_3536.md) says was composed by Saint Luke.

<span id="x.iv-p16"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="x.iv-p16.1"></span>Concerning the Same Work.</span>

<span id="x.iv-p17"></span>*Thus writes Origen*: <span
id="fr_3537"></span>[3538](#fn_3537.md) …in which *book* a Christian is
represented disputing with a Jew from the Jewish Scriptures, and showing
that the prophecies concerning the Christ apply to Jesus:  although his
opponent addresses himself to the argument with no common ability, <span
id="fr_3538"></span>[3539](#fn_3538.md) and in a manner not unbefitting his
Jewish character.
