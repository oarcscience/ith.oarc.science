<span id="vi.iv.xvi.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.xvi.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II.—Peter Relates to Nicetas and
Aquila the History of Clement and His Family.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xvi.ii-p2"></span>On my saying this, Peter gave them a
summary account <span id="fr_1159"></span>[1160](#fn_1159) of all the
incidents,—how, when they had gone on before, I Clement had explained to
him my descent, the journey undertaken by my mother with her twin
children on the false pretext of the dream; and furthermore, the journey
undertaken by my father in search of her; and then how Peter himself,
after hearing this, went into the island, met with the woman, saw her
begging, and asked the reason of her so doing; and then ascertained who
she was, and her mode of life, and the feigned dream, and the names of
her children—that is, the name borne by me, who was left with my father,
and the names of the twin children who travelled along with her, and
who, she supposed, had perished in the deep.
