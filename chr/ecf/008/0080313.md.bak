Dismissed.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.vi.xxxvii-p2"></span>When he had thus spoken, and had
charged them to come to the same place in good time on the following
day, he dismissed the crowds; and when they were unwilling to depart,
Peter said to them:  “Do me this favour on account of the fatigue of
yesterday’s journey; and now go away, and meet in good time to-morrow.” 
And so they departed with joy.  But Peter, commanding me to withdraw a
little for the purpose of prayer, <span
id="fr_749"></span>[750](#fn_749.md) afterwards ordered the couches to be
spread in the part of the garden which was covered with shade; and every
one, according to custom, recognising the place of his own rank, we took
food.  Then, as there was still some portion of the day left, he
conversed with us concerning the Lord’s miracles; and when evening was
come, he entered his bed-chamber and went to sleep.

is represented as not permitted to join with the disciples, even in
prayer.  \[Comp. i. 19, ii. 70–72.  This separation is indicated in the
*Homilies*, but more emphasis is placed upon it in the
*Recognitions*.—R.\]
