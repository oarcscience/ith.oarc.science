<span id="v.iii.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iii.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI.—Perniciousness of Idleness;
Warning Against the Empty Longing to Be Teachers; Advice About Teaching
and the Use of Divine Gifts.</span>

<span id="v.iii.xi-p2"></span>Such are the ways of all those who do not
work, but go hunting for tales, and think to themselves that this is
profitable and right. <span id="fr_384"></span>[385](#fn_384.md)   For such
persons are like those idle and prating widows “who go wandering
about <span id="fr_385"></span>[386](#fn_385.md) among houses” <span
id="fr_386"></span>[387](#fn_386.md) with their prating, and hunt for idle
tales, and carry them from house to house with much exaggeration,
without fear of God.  And besides all this, barefaced men as they
are, <span id="fr_387"></span>[388](#fn_387.md) under pretence of teaching,
they set forth a variety of doctrines.  And would that they taught the
doctrines of truth!  But it is this which is *so* disquieting, that they
understand not what they mean, and assert that which is not *true*: 
because they wish to be teachers, and to display themselves as skil<span
id="page_59">p. 59</span> <span id="v.iii.xi-Page_59"></span>ful in
speaking; because they traffic in iniquity in the name of Christ—which
it is not right for the servants of God *to do*.  And they hearken not
to that which the Scripture has said:  “Let not many be teachers among
you, my brethren, and be not all of you prophets.” <span
id="fr_388"></span>[389](#fn_388.md)   For “he who does not transgress in
word is a perfect man, able to keep down and subjugate his whole
body.” <span id="fr_389"></span>[390](#fn_389.md)   And, “If a man speak,
let him speak in the words <span id="fr_390"></span>[391](#fn_390.md) of
God.” <span id="fr_391"></span>[392](#fn_391.md)   And, “If there is in
thee understanding, give an answer to thy brother but if not, put thy
hand on thy mouth.” <span id="fr_392"></span>[393](#fn_392.md)   For, “at
one time *it is proper* to keep silence, and at another thee to
speak.” <span id="fr_393"></span>[394](#fn_393.md)   And again it says
“When a man speaks in season, it is honourable <span
id="fr_394"></span>[395](#fn_394.md) to him.” <span
id="fr_395"></span>[396](#fn_395.md)   And again it says:  “Let your speech
be seasoned with grace.  For it is required of a man to know how to give
an answer to every one in season.” <span
id="fr_396"></span>[397](#fn_396.md)   For “he that utters whatsoever comes
to his mouth, that man produces strife; and he that utters a superfluity
of words increases vexation; and he that is hasty with his lips falls
into evil.  For because of the unruliness of the tongue cometh anger;
but the perfect man keeps watch over his tongue, and loves his soul’s
life.” <span id="fr_397"></span>[398](#fn_397.md)   For these are they “who
by good words and fair speeches lead astray the hearts of the simple,
and, while offering them blessings, lead them astray.” <span
id="fr_398"></span>[399](#fn_398.md)   Let us, therefore, fear the judgment
which awaits teachers.  For a severe judgment will those teachers
receive “who teach, but do not,” <span id="fr_399"></span>[400](#fn_399.md)
and those who take *upon them* the name of Christ falsely, and say:  We
teach the truth, and *yet* go wandering about idly, and exalt
themselves, and make their boast” in the mind of the flesh.” <span
id="fr_400"></span>[401](#fn_400.md)   These, moreover, are like “the blind
man who leads the blind man, and they both fall into the ditch.” <span
id="fr_401"></span>[402](#fn_401.md)   And they will receive judgment,
because in their talkativeness and their frivolous teaching they teach
natural <span id="fr_402"></span>[403](#fn_402.md) wisdom and the
“frivolous error of the plausible words of the wisdom of men,” <span
id="fr_403"></span>[404](#fn_403.md) “according to the will of the prince
of the dominion of the air, and of the spirit which works in those men
who will not obey, according to the training of this world, and not
according to the doctrine of Christ.” <span
id="fr_404"></span>[405](#fn_404.md)   But if thou hast received “the word
of knowledge, or the word of instruction, or of prophecy,” <span
id="fr_405"></span>[406](#fn_405.md) blessed be God, “who helps every man
without grudging—that God who gives to every man and does not upbraid
*him*.” <span id="fr_406"></span>[407](#fn_406.md)   With the gift,
therefore, which thou hast received from our Lord, serve *thy* spiritual
brethren, the prophets who know that the words which thou speakest are
*those* of our Lord; and declare the gift which thou hast received in
the Church for the edification of the brethren in Christ (for good and
excellent are those things which help the men of God), if so be that
they are truly with thee. <span id="fr_407"></span>[408](#fn_407.md)
