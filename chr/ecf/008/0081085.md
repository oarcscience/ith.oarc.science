id="vi.iv.xx.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI.—The Fear of God.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xx.xi-p2"></span>“But some who are strangers to the
truth, and who give their energies to the service of evil, on pretext of
glorifying God, say that He has no figure, in order that, being
shapeless and formless, He may be visible to no one, so as not to be
longed for.  For the mind, not seeing the form of God, is empty of Him. 
But how can any one pray if he has no one to whom he may flee for
refuge, on whom he may lean?  For if he meets with no resistance, he
falls out into vacuity.  Yea, says he, we ought not to fear God, but to
love Him.  I agree; but the consciousness of having done well in each
good act will accomplish this.  Now well-doing proceeds from fearing. 
But fear, says he, strikes death into the soul.  Nay, but I affirm that
it does not strike death, but awakens the soul, and converts it.  And
perhaps the injunction not to fear God might be right, if we men did not
fear many other things; such, for instance, as plots against us by those
who are like us, and wild beasts, serpents, diseases, sufferings,
demons, and a thousand other ills.  Let him, then, who asks us not to
fear God, rescue us from these, that we may not fear them; but if he
cannot, why should he grudge that we should be delivered from a thousand
fears by one fear, the fear of the Just One, and that it should be
possible by a slight <span id="fr_1343"></span>[1344](#fn_1343.md) faith in
Him to remove a thousand afflictions from ourselves and others, and
receive instead an exchange of blessings, and that, doing no ill in
consequence of fear of the God who sees everything, we should continue
in peace even in the present life.

<span id="vi.iv.xx.xi-p3"></span> The word “slight” is not used in
reference to the character of the faith, but to indicate that the act of
faith is a small act compared with the results that flow from it.
