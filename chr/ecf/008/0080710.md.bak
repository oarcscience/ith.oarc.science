id="vi.iv.vi.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIII.—Two Kinds of
Prophecy.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.vi.xxiii-p2"></span>“Let us then understand that there
are two kinds of prophecy: <span id="fr_967"></span>[968](#fn_967.md)   the
one male; and let it be defined that the first, being the male, has been
ranked after the other in the order of advent; but the second, being
female, has been appointed to come first in the advent of the pairs. 
This second, therefore, being amongst those born of woman, as the female
superintendent of this present world, wishes to be thought
masculine. <span id="fr_968"></span>[969](#fn_968.md)   Wherefore, stealing
the seeds of the male, and sowing them with her own seeds of the flesh,
she brings forth the fruits—that is, words—as wholly her own.  And she
promises that she will give the present earthly riches as a dowry,
wishing to change the slow for the swift, the small for the greater.

tinged with Gnostic dualism; much of the matter might, according to
tradition, have been equally well put in the mouth of Simon.—R.\]
