id="vi.iv.viii.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVI.—Praise of
Unchastity.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.viii.xvi-p2"></span>“‘Thus have I in part set before you
the amours of all the more noted gods, beloved, that you may know that
fanaticism respecting this thing is confined to senseless men. 
Therefore they are mortal, and spend their lives sadly, because through
their zeal they proclaim those things to be evil which the gods esteem
as excellent.  Therefore for the future you will be blessed, imitating
the gods, and not men.  For men, seeing you preserving that which is
thought to be chastity, on account of what they themselves feel, praise
you indeed, but do not help you.  But the gods, seeing you like unto
themselves, will both praise and help.
