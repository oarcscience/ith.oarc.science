Others?”</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xiv.xxxi-p2"></span>“But some one of you will say, Must
we then do whatsoever things we did while we were idolaters?  I say to
you, Not all things; but whatsoever you did well, you must do now, and
more:  for whatsoever is well done in error hangs upon truth, as if
anything be ill done in the truth it is from error.  Receive, therefore,
from all quarters the things that are your own, and not those that are
another’s, and do not say, If those who are in error do anything well we
are not bound to do it.  For, on this principle, if any one who worships
idols do not commit murder, we ought to commit murder, because he who is
in error does not commit it.
