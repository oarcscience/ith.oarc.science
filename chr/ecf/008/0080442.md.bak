To-Morrow.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.x.xxxvi-p2"></span>And when the old man had said this,
Peter said to the chief man of the city:  “Since you have shown your
good-will in our presence, it is not right that you should go away
sorrowful; but we will accept from you favour for favour.  Show us your
house, and make it ready, so that the discussion which is to be
to-morrow may be held there, and that any who wish to be present to hear
it may be admitted.”  When the chief man of the city heard this, he
rejoiced greatly; and all the people also heard it gladly.  And when the
crowds had dispersed, he pointed out his house; and the old man also was
preparing to depart.  But I commanded one of my attendants to follow the
old man secretly, and find out where he stayed.  And when we returned to
our lodging, we told our brethren all our dealings with the old man; and
so, as usual, we supped and went to sleep.
