<span id="vi.iii.xi.xviii-p2"></span>And when the old man had pursued
this subject at great length, and had enumerated every kind of
mathematical figure, and also the position of the heavenly bodies,
wishing thereby to show that fear is not sufficient to restrain lusts, I
answered again:  “Truly, my father, you have argued most learnedly and
skilfully; and reason herself invites me to say something in answer to
your discourse, since indeed I am acquainted with the science of
mathematics, and gladly hold a conference with so learned a man.  Listen
therefore, while I reply to what you have said that you may learn
distinctly that <span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iii.xi.xviii-p2.1"></span>Genesis</span> is not at all from the
stars, and that it is possible for those to resist the assault of demons
who have recourse to God; and, as I said before, that not only by the
fear of God can natural lusts be restrained, but even by the fear of
men, as we shall now instruct you.
