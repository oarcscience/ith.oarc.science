id="vi.iv.vi.xxxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXVIII.—Simon’s
Challenge.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.vi.xxxviii-p2"></span>When Peter had thus spoken, Simon,
at the outside of the crowd, cried aloud: <span
id="fr_977"></span>[978](#fn_977.md)   “Why would you lie, and deceive the
unlearned multitude standing around you, persuading them that it is
unlawful to think that there are gods, and to call them so, when the
books that are current among the Jews say that there are many
gods? <span id="fr_978"></span>[979](#fn_978.md)   And now I wish, in the
presence of all, to discuss with you from these books on the necessity
of thinking that there are gods; first showing respecting him whom you
call God, that he is not the supreme and omnipotent *Being*, inasmuch as
he is without foreknowledge, imperfect, needy, not good, and underlying
many and innumerable grievous passions.  Wherefore, when this has been
shown from the Scriptures, as I say, it follows that there is another,
not written of, foreknowing, perfect, without want, good, removed from
all grievous passions.  But he whom you call the Creator is subject to
the opposite *evils*.

*Recognitions* is quite different, though the substance of this attack
is given in the progress of this discussion; see *Recognitions*, ii.
