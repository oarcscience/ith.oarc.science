Magicians.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.ix.xx-p2"></span>“Then those who chose to make
dishonourable allegories of divine things—as, for instance, that Metis
was devoured by Zeus—have fallen into a dilemma, because they did not
see that they who in these stories about the gods indirectly taught
physics, denied the very existence of the gods, revolving all kinds of
gods into mere allegorical representations of the various substances of
the universe.  And so it is more likely that the gods these persons
celebrate were some sort of wicked magicians, who were in reality wicked
men, but by magic assumed different shapes, committed adulteries, and
took away life, and thus to the men of old who did not understand magic
seemed to be gods by the things they did; and the bodies and tombs of
these men are to be seen in many towns.
