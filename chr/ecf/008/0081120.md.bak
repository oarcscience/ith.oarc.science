<span id="vi.iv.xxii.i-p3"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iv.xxii.i-p3.1"></span>The</span> next day Peter came forth
earlier than usual; and seeing Simon with many others waiting for him,
he saluted the multitude, and began to discourse.  But no sooner did he
begin than Simon interrupted him, and said:  “Pass by these long
introductions of yours, and answer directly the questions I put to you. 
Since I perceive that you <span id="fr_1401"></span>[1402](#fn_1401.md) (as
I know from what I heard at the beginning, that you have no other
purpose, than by every contrivance to show that the Creator himself is
alone the blameless God),—since, as I said, I perceive that you have
such a decided desire to maintain this, that you venture to declare to
be false some portions of the Scriptures that clearly speak against him,
for this reason I have determined to-day to prove that it is impossible
that he, being the Creator of all, should be blameless.  But thus proof
I can now begin, if you reply to the questions which I put to you.

has proposed to amend it by bold transposition of the clauses.  We make
one slight alteration in the text.
