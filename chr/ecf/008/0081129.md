id="vi.iv.xxii.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter X.—The Absolute God Entirely
Incomprehensible by Man.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxii.x-p2"></span>“For instance, then, what did you say
in the beginning?  If the wicked one has been begotten of God, being of
the same substance as He, then God is wicked.  But when I showed you,
from the example which you yourself adduced, that wicked beings come
from good, and good from wicked, you did not admit the argument, for you
said that the example was a human one.  Wherefore I now do not admit
that the term ‘being begotten’ <span
id="fr_1425"></span>[1426](#fn_1425.md) can be used with reference to God;
for it is characteristic of man, and not of God, to beget.  Not only so;
but God cannot be good or evil, just or unjust.  Nor indeed can He have
intelligence, or life, or any of the other attributes which can exist in
man; for all these are peculiar to man.  And if we must not, in our
investigations in regard to God, give Him the good attributes which
belong to man, it is not possible for us to have any thought or make any
statement in regard to God; but all we can do is to investigate One
point alone,—namely, what is His will which He has Himself allowed us to
apprehend, in order that, being judged, we might be without excuse in
regard to those laws which we have not observed, though we knew them.”

it is, “I do not admit that God had been begotten.”
