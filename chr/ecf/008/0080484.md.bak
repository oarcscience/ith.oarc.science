id="vi.iii.xi.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XV.—Fear of Men and of God.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.xi.xv-p2"></span>“But as a proof that the fear of God
has much efficacy for the repressing of lusts, take the example of human
fear.  Who is there among men that does not covet his neighbour’s
goods?  And yet they are restrained, and act honestly, through fear of
the punishment which is prescribed by the laws.  Through fear, nations
are subject to their kings, and armies obey with arms in their hands. 
Slaves, although they are stronger than their masters, yet through fear
submit to their masters’ rule.  Even wild beasts are tamed by fear; the
strongest bulls submit their necks to the yoke, and huge elephants obey
their masters, through fear.  But why do we use human examples, when
even divine are not wanting?  Does not the earth itself remain under the
fear of precept, which it testifies by its motion and quaking?  The sea
keeps its prescribed bounds; the angels maintain peace; the stars keep
their order, and the rivers their channels:  it is certain also that
demons are put to flight by fear.  And not to lengthen the discourse by
too many particulars, see how the fear of God, restraining everything,
keeps all things in proper harmony, and in their fixed order.  How much
more, then, may you be sure that the lusts of demons which arise in your
hearts may be extinguished and wholly abolished by the admonition of the
fear of God, when even the inciters of lust are themselves put to flight
by the influence of fear?  You know that these things are so; but if you
have anything to answer, proceed.”
