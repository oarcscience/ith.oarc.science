<span id="vi.iii.x.xxxix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iii.x.xxxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXIX.—Recapitulation of
Yesterday’s Argument.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.x.xxxix-p2"></span>When Peter had thus spoken,
immediately the crowd began to make room for the old man. <span
id="fr_819"></span>[820](#fn_819)   And when he had come forward, he
thus began:  “Although I do not remember the words of the discourse
which the young man delivered yesterday, yet I recollect the purport and
the order of it; and therefore I think it necessary, for the sake of
those who were not present yesterday, to call up what was said, and to
repeat everything shortly, that, although something may have escaped me,
I may be reminded of it by him who delivered the discourse, who is now
present.  This, then, was the purport of yesterday’s discussion:  that
all things that we see, inasmuch as they consist in a certain
proportion, and art, and form, and species, must be believed to have
been made by intelligent power; but if it be mind and reason that has
formed them, it follows that the world is governed by the providence of
the same reason, although the things which are done in the world may
seem to us to be not quite rightly done.  But it follows, that if God
and mind is the creator of all things, He must also be just; but if
<span id="page_176">p. 176</span> <span
id="vi.iii.x.xxxix-Page_176"></span>He is just, He necessarily judges. 
If He judges, it is of necessity that men be judged with respect to
their doings; and if every one is judged in respect of his doings, there
shall at some time be a righteous separation between righteous men and
sinners.  This, I think, was the substance of the whole discourse.

which Aquila is the main speaker, is also of a high order.  It is, as
already indicated, peculiar to the *Recognitions*, though with the usual
incidental correspondences in the *Homilies*.—R.\]
