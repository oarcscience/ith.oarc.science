<span id="vi.iii.iv.liii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iii.iv.liii-p1.1"></span>Chapter LIII.—Simon’s Blasphemy.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iv.liii-p2"></span>Then says Simon:  “Listen:  it is
manifest to all, and ascertained in a manner of which no account can be
given, <span id="fr_662"></span>[663](#fn_662.md) that there is one God,
who is better than all, from whom all that is took its beginning; whence
also of necessity, all things that are after him are subject to him, as
the chief <span id="page_112">p. 112</span> <span
id="vi.iii.iv.liii-Page_112"></span>and most excellent of all.  When,
therefore, I had ascertained that the God who created the world,
according to what the law teaches, is in many respects weak, whereas
weakness is utterly incompatible with a perfect God, and I saw that he
is not perfect, I necessarily concluded that there is another God who is
perfect. <span id="fr_663"></span>[664](#fn_663.md)   For this God, as I
have said, according to what the writing of the law teaches, is shown to
be weak in many things.  In the first place, because the man whom he
formed was not able to remain such as he had intended him to be; and
because he cannot be good who gave a law to the first man, that he
should eat of all the trees of paradise, but that he should not touch
the tree of knowledge; and if he should eat of it, he should die.  For
why should he forbid him to eat, and to know what is good and what evil,
that, knowing, he might shun the evil and choose the good?  But this he
did not permit; and because he did eat in violation of the commandment,
and discovered what is good, and learned for the sake of honour to cover
his nakedness (for he perceived it to be unseemly to stand naked before
his Creator), he condemns to death him who had learned to do honour to
God, and curses the serpent who had shown him these things.  But truly,
if man was to be injured by this means, why did he place the cause of
injury in paradise at all?  But if that which he placed in paradise was
good, it is not the part of one that is good to restrain another from
good.”

<span id="vi.iii.iv.liii-p3"></span> We render by a periphrasis the
expression *ineffabili quadam ratione compertum*.  The meaning seems to
be, that the belief of the existence and unity of God is not the result
of reasoning, but of intuition or instinct.

<span id="vi.iii.iv.liii-p4"></span> \[The argument of Simon here
differs from that represented in Homilies XVII., XVIII.  There Simon
asserts that the Framer of the world is not the highest God, because He
is not both just and good.  Comp. also book iii. 37, 38.—R.\]
