<span id="vi.iv.xvi.xviii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.xvi.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.—Peter’s Speech
Continued.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xvi.xviii-p2"></span>“Much better is it if you will take
her by the hand and come, in order that you yourself may become chaste;
for you will desire to become chaste, that you may experience the full
fruition of a holy marriage, and you will not scruple, if you desire it,
to become a father, <span id="fr_1183"></span>[1184](#fn_1183) to love
your own children, and to be loved by your own children.  He who wishes
to have a chaste wife is also himself chaste, gives her what is due to a
wife, takes his meals with her, keeps company with her, goes with her to
the word that makes chaste, does not grieve her, does not rashly quarrel
with her, does not make himself hateful to her, furnishes her with all
the good things he can, and when he has them not, he makes up the
deficiency by caresses.  The chaste wife does not expect to be caressed,
recognises her husband as her lord, bears his poverty when he is poor,
is hungry with him when he is hungry, travels with him when he travels,
consoles him when he is grieved, and if she have a large <span
id="fr_1184"></span>[1185](#fn_1184) dowry, is subject to him as if she
had nothing at all.  But if the husband have a poor wife, let him reckon
her chastity a great dowry.  The chaste wife is temperate in her eating
and drinking, in order that the weariness of the body, thus pampered,
may not drag the soul down to unlawful desires.  Moreover, she never
assuredly remains alone with young men, and she suspects <span
id="fr_1185"></span>[1186](#fn_1185) the old; she turns away from
disorderly laughter, gives herself up to God alone; she is not led
astray; she delights in listening to holy words, but turns away from
those which are not spoken to produce chastity.

<span id="vi.iv.xvi.xviii-p3"></span> There seems to be some corruption
in this clause.  Literally, it is, “and you will not scruple, if you
love, I mean, to become a father.”

<span id="vi.iv.xvi.xviii-p4"></span> Lit., “larger” *than usual*.

and Lehmann render “respects” or “reveres.”
