id="vi.iv.iii.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter IX.—“Let Brotherly Love
Continue.”</span>

<span id="vi.iv.iii.ix-p2"></span>“But I know that ye will do these
things if you fix love into your minds; and for its entrance there is
one only fit means, viz., the common partaking of food. <span
id="fr_895"></span>[896](#fn_895)   Wherefore see to it that ye be
frequently one another’s guests, as ye are able, that you may not fail
of it.  For it is the cause of well-doing, and well-doing of salvation. 
Therefore all of you present your provisions in common to all your
brethren in God, knowing that, giving temporal things, you shall receive
eternal things.  Much more feed the hungry, and give drink to the
thirsty, and clothing to the naked; visit the sick; showing yourselves
to those who are in prison, help them as ye are able, and receive
strangers into your houses with all alacrity.  However, not to speak in
detail, philanthropy will teach you to do everything that is good, as
misanthropy suggests ill-doing to those who will not be saved.
