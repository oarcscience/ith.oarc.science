<span id="vi.iii.x.lix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iii.x.lix-p1.1"></span>Chapter LIX.—The True Prophet.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.x.lix-p2"></span>But I would not have you think, that
in saying this I take away the power of judging concerning things; but I
give counsel that no one walk through devious places, and rush into
errors without end.  And therefore I advise not only wise men, but
indeed all men who have a desire of knowing what is advantageous to
them, that they seek after the true Prophet; for it is He alone who
knoweth all things, and who knoweth what and how every man is
seeking. <span id="fr_829"></span>[830](#fn_829)   For He is within the
mind of every one of us, but in those who have no desire of the
knowledge of God and His righteousness, He is inoperative; but He works
in those who seek after that which is profitable to their souls, and
kindles in them the light of knowledge.  Wherefore seek Him first of
all; and if you do not find Him, expect not that you shall learn
anything from any other.  But He is soon found by those who diligently
seek Him through love of the truth, and whose souls are not taken
possession of by wickedness.  For He is present with those who desire
Him in the innocency of their spirits, who bear patiently, and draw
sighs from the bottom of their hearts through love of the truth; but He
deserts malevolent minds, <span id="fr_830"></span>[831](#fn_830)
because as a prophet He knows the thoughts of every one.  And therefore
let no one think that he can find Him by his own wisdom, unless, as we
have said, he empty his mind of all wickedness, and conceive a pure and
faithful desire to know Him.  For when any one has so prepared himself,
He Himself as a prophet, seeing a mind prepared for Him, of His own
accord offers Himself to his knowledge.
