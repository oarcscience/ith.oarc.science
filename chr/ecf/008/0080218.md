id="vi.iii.v.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.—Manner of Conducting the
Discussion.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.v.viii-p2"></span>Then Peter said:  “In what way do you
put the question; as wishing to learn, or to teach or for the sake of
raising the question?  If indeed as wishing to learn, I have something
to teach you first, that coming by consequence and the right order of
doctrine, you may understand from yourself what evil is.  But if you put
the question as an instructor, I have no need to be taught by you, for I
have a Master from whom I have learned all things.  But if you ask
merely for the sake of raising a question and disputing, let each of us
first set forth his opinion, and so let the matter be debated.  For it
is not reasonable that you should ask as one wishing to learn, and
contradict as one teaching, so that after my answer it should be in your
discretion to say whether I have spoken well or ill.  Wherefore you
cannot stand in the place of a gainsayer and be judge of what we say. 
And therefore, as I said, if a discussion is to be held, let each of us
state his sentiments; and while we are placed in conflict, these
religious hearers will be just judges.”
