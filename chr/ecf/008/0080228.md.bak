id="vi.iii.v.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVIII.—Why to Be
Dissolved.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.v.xviii-p2"></span>To this Peter replied:  “Since we
have promised not to run away from your blasphemies, we endure them
patiently, for you shall yourself render an account for the things that
you speak.  Listen now, therefore.  If indeed that heaven which is
visible and transient had been made for its own sake, there would have
been some reason in what you say, that it ought not to be dissolved. 
But if it was made not for its own sake, but for the sake of something
else, it must of necessity be dissolved, that that for which it seems to
have been made may appear.  As I might say, by way of illustration,
however fairly and carefully the shell of the egg may seem to have been
formed, it is yet necessary that it be broken and opened, that the chick
may issue from it, and that may appear for which the form of the whole
egg seems to have been moulded.  So also, therefore, it is necessary
that the condition of this world pass away, that that sublimer condition
of the heavenly kingdom may shine forth.”
