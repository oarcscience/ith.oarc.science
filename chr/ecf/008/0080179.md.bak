<span id="vi.iii.iv.xlii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iii.iv.xlii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLII.—Guardian Angels.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iv.xlii-p2"></span>“Therefore the name *God* is applied
in three ways: <span id="fr_641"></span>[642](#fn_641.md)   either because
he to whom it is given is truly God, or because he is the servant of him
who is truly; and for the honour of the sender, that his authority may
be full, he that is sent is <span id="page_109">p. 109</span> <span
id="vi.iii.iv.xlii-Page_109"></span>called by the name of him who sends,
as is often done in respect of angels:  for when they appear to a man,
if he is a wise and intelligent man, he asks the name of him who appears
to him, that he may acknowledge at once the honour of the sent, and the
authority of the sender.  For every nation has an angel, to whom God has
committed the government of that nation; and when one of these appears,
although he be thought and called God by those over whom he presides,
yet, being asked, he does not give such testimony to himself.  For the
Most High God, who alone holds the power of all things, has divided all
the nations of the earth into seventy-two parts, and over these He hath
appointed angels as princes.  But to the one among the archangels who is
greatest, was committed the government of those who, before all others,
received the worship and knowledge of the Most High God.  But holy men
also, as we have said, are made gods to the wicked, as having received
the power of life and death over them, as we mentioned above with
respect to Moses and the judges.  Wherefore it is also written
concerning them, ‘Thou shalt not curse the gods, and thou shalt not
curse the prince of thy people.’ <span id="fr_642"></span>[643](#fn_642.md)
  Thus the princes of the several nations are called gods.  But Christ
is God of princes, who is Judge of all.  Therefore neither angels, nor
men, nor any creature, can be truly gods, forasmuch as they are placed
under authority, being created and changeable:  angels, for they were
not, and are; men, for they are mortal; and every creature, for it is
capable of dissolution, if only He dissolve it who made it.  And
therefore He alone is the true God, who not only Himself lives, but also
bestows life upon others, which He can also take away when it pleaseth
Him.
