<span id="vi.iv.xv.xxviii-p2"></span>Then said Peter, “These things are
ordinary:  now hear what is greater.  There are some men whose sins or
good deeds are partly their own, and partly those of others; but it is
right that each one be punished for his own sins, and rewarded for his
own merits.  But it is impossible for any one except a prophet, who
alone has omniscience, to know with respect to the things that are done
by any one, which are his own, and which are not; for all are seen as
done by him.”  Then I said, “I would learn how some of men’s
wrong-doings or right-doings are their own, and some belong to others.”
