<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xvii.iv-p2"></A>&#8220;And I said:&#160; &#145;If all things are subject to Genesis, and you are fully convinced that this is the case, your thoughts and advice are contrary to your own opinion.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1197"></A><A HREF="#fn_1197"><FONT SIZE="1">1198</FONT></A>
&#160; For if it is impossible even to think in opposition to Genesis, why do you toil in vain, advising me to do what cannot be done?&#160; Yea, moreover, even if Genesis subsists, do not make haste to prevail on me not to worship Him who is also Lord of the stars, by whose wish that a thing should not take place, that thing becomes an impossibility.&#160; For always that which is subject must obey that which rules.&#160; As far, however, as the worship of the common gods is concerned, that is superfluous, if Genesis has sway.&#160; For neither does anything happen contrary to what seems good to fate, nor are they themselves able to do anything, since they are subject to their own universal Genesis.&#160; If Genesis exists, there is this objection to it, that that which is not first has the rule; or, <i>in other words</i>, the uncreated cannot be subject, for the uncreated, as being uncreated, has nothing that is older than itself.&#146;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1198"></A><A HREF="#fn_1198"><FONT SIZE="1">1199</FONT></A>

<p class="endnote"><a name="vi.iv.xvii.iv-p4"></A> The argument here is obscure.&#160; Probably what is intended is as follows:&#160; Genesis means origination, coming into being.&#160; Origination cannot be the ruling power, for there must be something unoriginated which has given rise to the origination.&#160; The origination, therefore, as not being first, cannot have sway, and it must itself be subject to that which is unoriginated.</p>
