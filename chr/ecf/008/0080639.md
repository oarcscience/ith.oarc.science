id="vi.iv.v.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI.—The True Prophet.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.v.vi-p2"></span>“Now the Prophet of the truth is He who
always knows all things—things past as they were, things present as they
are, things future as they shall be; sinless, merciful, alone entrusted
with the declaration of the truth.  Read, and you shall find that those
*were deceived* <span id="fr_919"></span>[920](#fn_919.md) who thought that
they had found the truth of themselves.  For this is peculiar to the
Prophet, to declare the truth, even as it is peculiar to the sun to
bring the day.  Wherefore, as many as have even desired to know the
truth, but have not had the good fortune to learn it from Him, have not
<span id="page_230">p. 230</span> <span
id="vi.iv.v.vi-Page_230"></span>found it, but have died seeking it.  For
how can he find the truth who seeks it from his own ignorance?  And even
if he find it, he does not know it, and passes it by as if it were not. 
Nor yet shall he be able to obtain possession of the truth from another,
who, in like manner, promises to him knowledge from ignorance; excepting
only the knowledge of morality and things of that sort, which can be
known through reason, which affords to every one the knowledge that he
ought not to wrong another, through his not wishing *himself* to be
wronged.

<span id="vi.iv.v.vi-p3"></span> “Were deceived” is not in the text, but
the sense demands some such expression should be supplied.
