id="vi.iv.iv.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—Departure from Rome.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.iv.viii-p2"></span>While I spoke thus concerning others,
I also lectured myself, saying, Why do I blame others, being myself
guilty of the very same crime of heedlessness?  But I shall hasten into
Judæa, having first arranged my affairs. <span
id="fr_902"></span>[903](#fn_902.md)   And when I had thus made up my mind,
there occurred a long time of delay, my worldly affairs being difficult
to arrange.  Therefore, meditating further on the nature of life, that
by involving <span id="fr_903"></span>[904](#fn_903.md) men in hope it lays
snares for those who are making haste, yea, and how much time I had been
robbed of while tossed by hopes, and that we men die while thus
occupied, I left all my affairs as they were, and sped to Portus; <span
id="fr_904"></span>[905](#fn_904.md) and coming to the harbour, and being
taken on board a ship, I was borne by adverse winds to Alexandria
instead of Judæa; and being detained there by stress of weather, I
consorted with the philosophers, and told them about the rumour and the
sayings of him who had appeared in Rome.  And they answered that indeed
they knew nothing of him who had appeared in Rome; but concerning Him
who was born in Judæa, and who was said by the report to be the Son of
God, they had heard from many who had come from thence, and had learned
respecting all the wonderful things that He did with a word.
