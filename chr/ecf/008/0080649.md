id="vi.iv.v.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVI.—Man’s Ways Opposite to
God’s.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.v.xvi-p2"></span>“As in the beginning God, who is one,
like a right hand and a left, made the heavens first and then the earth,
so also He constituted all the combinations in order; but upon men He no
more does this, but varies all the combinations.  For whereas from Him
the greater things come first, and the inferior second, we find the
opposite in men—the first worse, and the second superior.  Therefore
from Adam, who was made after the image of God, there sprang first the
unrighteous Cain, and then the righteous Abel.  Again, from him who
amongst you is called Deucalion, <span id="fr_923"></span>[924](#fn_923.md)
two forms of spirits were sent forth, the impure namely, and the pure,
first the black raven, and then the white dove.  From Abraham also, the
patriarchs of our nation, two firsts <span
id="fr_924"></span>[925](#fn_924.md) sprang—Ishmael first, then Isaac, who
was blessed of God.  And from Isaac himself, in like manner, there were
again two—Esau the profane, and Jacob the pious.  So, first in birth, as
the first born in the world, was the high priest *Aaron*, then the
lawgiver *Moses*.
