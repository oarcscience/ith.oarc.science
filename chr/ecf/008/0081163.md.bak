Restore to Faustus His Own Shape.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxiii.xviii-p2"></span>Then Peter promised to us to
restore the shape of our father, and he said to him:  “Faustus, you
heard how matters stand with us.  When, therefore, the deceptive shape
which invests you has been useful to us, and you have assisted us in
doing what I shall tell you to do, then I shall restore to you your true
form, when <span id="page_345">p. 345</span> <span
id="vi.iv.xxiii.xviii-Page_345"></span>you have first performed my
commands.”  And when my father said, “I shall do everything that is in
my power most willingly; only restore to my own people my own form;”
Peter answered, “You yourself heard with your own ears how those who
went before me came back from Antioch, and said that Simon had been
there, and had strongly excited the multitudes against me by calling me
a magician and a murderer, a deceiver and a juggler, to such an extent
that all the people there were eager to taste my flesh.  You will do,
then, as I tell you.  You will leave Clement with me, and you will go
before us into Antioch with your wife, and your sons Faustinus and
Faustinianus.  And some others will accompany you whom I deem capable of
helping forward my design.
