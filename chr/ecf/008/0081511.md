<span id="x.v.xiv-p2"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="x.v.xiv-p2.1"></span>On the Nature of Christ. <span
id="fr_3634"></span>[3635](#fn_3634.md) </span>

<span id="x.v.xiv-p4"></span>For there is no need, to persons of
intelligence, to attempt to prove, from the deeds of Christ subsequent
to His baptism, that His soul and His body, His human nature <span
id="fr_3635"></span>[3636](#fn_3635.md) like ours, were real, and no
phantom of the imagination.  For the deeds done by Christ after His
baptism, and especially His miracles, gave indication and assurance to
the world of the Deity hidden in His flesh.  For, being at once both God
and perfect man likewise, He gave us sure indications of His two
natures: <span id="fr_3636"></span>[3637](#fn_3636.md)   of His Deity, by
His miracles during the three years that elapsed after His baptism; of
His humanity, during the thirty *similar* periods which preceded His
baptism, in which, by reason of His low estate <span
id="fr_3637"></span>[3638](#fn_3637.md) as regards the flesh, He concealed
the signs of His Deity, although He was the true God existing before all
ages.
