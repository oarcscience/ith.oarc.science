<span id="ii-p2"></span> ————————————

<span id="ii-p3"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="ii-p3.1"></span>This</span> volume completes the American series,
according to our agreement.  But it will be found to afford much
material over and above what was promised, and the editorial labour it
has exacted has been much greater than might at first be suspected.  The
Bibliography with which the work is supplemented, and which is the
original work of Dr. Riddle, has been necessarily thrown into the Index
by the overgrowth of this volume in original matter.

<span id="ii-p4"></span>The Apocryphal works of the Edinburgh collection
have been here brought together, and “Fragments” have been sifted, and
arranged on a plan strictly practical.  To my valued collaborator Dr.
Riddle I have committed a task which demanded a specialist of his
eminent qualifications.  He has had, almost exclusively, the task of
editing the *Pseudo-Clementina* and the *Apocryphal New Testament*.  To
myself I assigned the *Twelve Patriarchs* and *Excerpts*, the *Edessene
Memoirs and other Syriac Fragments*, the *False Decretals*, and the
*Remains of the First Ages*.  I have reserved this retrospect of
historic truth and testimony to complete the volume.  As in music the
tune ends on the note with which it began, so, after the greater part of
the volume had been surrendered to forgery and fiction (valuable,
indeed, for purposes of comparison and reference, but otherwise unworthy
of a place among primitive witnesses), I felt it refreshing to return to
genuine writings and to authentic histories.  The pages of Melito and
others will restore something of the flavour of the Apostolic Fathers to
our taste, and the student will not close his review of the *Ante-Nicene
Fathers* with last impressions derived only from their fraudulent
imitators and corrupters.

<span id="ii-p5"></span>The editor-in-chief renews his grateful
acknowledgments to those who have aided him in his undertaking, with
whose honoured names the reader is already acquainted.  Nor can he omit
an expression of thanks to the reverend brother <span
id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md) to whom the hard work of the Indexes has
been chiefly committed.  It would be equally unjust not to mention his
obligations to the meritorious press which has produced these pages with
a general accuracy not easily ensured under difficulties such as have
been inseparable from this undertaking. <span
id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1.md)   The support which has been liberally
afforded to the enterprise by Christians of divers names and communions
ought not to be recognised by words of mere recognition:  it is a token
of their common interest in a common origin, and a sign, perhaps, of a
longing for that precious unity and brotherhood which was the glory of
the martyr ages, for which all should unite in praise to God.  To the
Christian press a grateful tribute is due from the editor and his
publishers alike; more especially as it has encouraged, so generally,
the production of another series, of which the first volume has already
appeared, and which will familiarize the minds and hearts of thousands
with the living thought and burning piety of those great doctors of the
post-Nicene period, to whom the world owes such immense obligations, but
who have been so largely unknown to millions even of educated men,
except as bright and shining names.

<span id="ii-p8"></span>It is a cheering token, that, while the
superficial popular mind may even be disposed to regard <span
id="page_vi">p. vi</span> <span id="ii-Page_vi"></span>this collection
as a mere museum of fossils, having little or no connection with
anything that interests our age, there is a twofold movement towards a
fresh investigation of the past, which it seems providentially designed
to meet.  Thus, among Christians there is a general appetite for the
study of primitive antiquity, stimulated by the decadence of the Papacy,
and by the agitations concerning the theology of the future which have
arisen in Reformed communions; while, on the other hand, scientific
thought has pushed inquiry as to the sources of the world’s
enlightenment, and has found them just here,—in the school of
Alexandria, and in the Christian writers of the first three centuries. 
“It is instructive,” says a forcible thinker, <span
id="fr_2"></span>[3](#fn_2.md) and a disciple of Darwin and Huxley, “to
note how closely Athanasius approaches the confines of modern scientific
thought.”  And again he says:  “The intellectual atmosphere of
Alexandria for two centuries before and three centuries after the time
of Christ was *more modern* than anything that followed, down to the
days of Bacon and Descartes.”

<span id="ii-p10"></span>It would be unmanly in the editor to speak of
the difficulties and hindrances through which he has been forced to push
on his work, while engaged in other and very sacred duties.  The
conditions which alone could justify the publishers in the venture were
quite inconsistent with such an editorial performance as might satisfy
his own ideas of what should be done with such materials.  Four years
instead of two, he felt, should be bestowed on such a work; and he
thought that two years might suffice only in case a number of
collaborators could be secured for simultaneous employment.  When it was
found that such a plan was impracticable, and that the idea must be
abandoned if not undertaken and carried forward as it has been, then the
writer most reluctantly assumed his great responsibility in the fear of
God, and in dependence on His lovingkindness and tender mercy.  Of the
result, he can only say that “he has done what he could” in the
circumstances.  He is rewarded by the consciousness that at least he has
enabled many an American divine and scholar to avail himself of the
labours of the Edinburgh translators, and to feel what is due to them,
when, but for this publication, he must have remained in ignorance of
what their erudition has achieved and contributed to Christian learning
in the English tongue.

<span id="ii-p11"></span>And how sweet and invigorating has been his
task, as page after page of these treasures of antiquity has passed
under his hand and eye!  With unfailing appetite he has risen before
daylight to his work; and far into the night he has extended it, with
ever fresh interest and delight.  Obliged very often to read his proofs,
or prepare his notes, at least in their first draught, while journeying
by land or by water, he has generally found in such employments, not
additional fatigue, but a real comfort and resource, a balance to other
cares, and a sweet preparation and invigoration for other labours.  Oh,
how much he owes, under God, to these “guides, philosophers, and
friends,”—these Fathers of old time,—and to “their Father and our
Father, their God and our God”!  What love is due from all who love
Christ, for the words they have spoken, and the deeds they have done, to
assure us that the Everlasting Word is He to whom alone we can go for
the words of life eternal!
