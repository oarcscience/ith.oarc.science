<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.xii.lxviii-p2"></A>But Simon began, though secretly, to go amongst his friends and acquaintances, and to malign Peter more than before.&#160; Then all spat in his face, and drove him from the city, saying:&#160; &#8220;You will be chargeable with your own death, if you think of coming hither again, speaking against Peter.&#8221;&#160; These things being known <i>at</i> <A NAME="page_210"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 210</FONT></A> <a name="vi.iii.xii.lxviii-Page_210"></A><i>Laodicea</i>, Peter ordered the people to meet on the following day; and having ordained one of those who followed him as bishop over them, and others as presbyters, and having baptized multitudes, and restored to health all who were troubled with sicknesses or demons, he stayed there three days longer; and all things being properly arranged, he bade them farewell, and set out from Laodicea, being much longed for by the people of Antioch.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_883"></A><A HREF="#fn_883"><FONT SIZE="1">884</FONT></A>
&#160; And the whole city began to hear, through Niceta and Aquila, that Peter was coming.&#160; Then all the people of the city of Antioch, hearing of Peter&#146;s arrival, went to meet him, and almost all the old men and the nobles came with ashes sprinkled on their heads, in this way testifying their repentance, because they had listened to the magician Simon, in opposition to his preaching.</p>
