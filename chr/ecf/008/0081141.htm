<p class="c35"><a name="vi.iv.xxii.xxii-p1"></A> <span class="c1"><a name="vi.iv.xxii.xxii-p1.1"></A>Chapter XXII.&#8212;Sins of Ignorance.</span></p> 
<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xxii.xxii-p2"></A>And Simon:&#160; &#8220;Why is it, then, that some die prematurely, and periodical diseases arise; and that there are, moreover, attacks of demons, and of madness, and all other kinds of afflictions which can greatly punish?&#8221;&#160; And Peter said:&#160; &#8220;Because men, following their own pleasure in all things, cohabit without observing the proper times; and thus the deposition of seed, taking place unseasonably, naturally produces a multitude of evils.&#160; For they ought to reflect, that as a season has been fixed suitable for planting and sowing,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1464"></A><A HREF="#fn_1464"><FONT SIZE="1">1465</FONT></A>
 so days have been appointed as appropriate for cohabitation, which are carefully to be observed.&#160; Accordingly some one well instructed in the doctrines taught by Moses, finding fault with the people for their sins, called them sons of the new moons and the sabbaths.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1465"></A><A HREF="#fn_1465"><FONT SIZE="1">1466</FONT></A>
&#160; Yet in the beginning of the world men lived long, and had no diseases.&#160; But when through carelessness they neglected the observation of the proper times, then the sons in succession cohabiting through ignorance at times when&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1466"></A><A HREF="#fn_1466"><FONT SIZE="1">1467</FONT></A>
 they ought not, place their children under innumerable afflictions.&#160; Whence our Teacher, when we inquired of Him&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1467"></A><A HREF="#fn_1467"><FONT SIZE="1">1468</FONT></A>
 in regard to the man who was blind from his birth, and recovered his sight, if this man sinned, or his parents, that he should be born blind, answered, &#145;Neither did he sin at all, nor his parents, but that the power of God might be made manifest through him in healing the sins of ignorance.&#146;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1468"></A><A HREF="#fn_1468"><FONT SIZE="1">1469</FONT></A>
&#160; And, in truth, such afflictions arise because of ignorance; as, for instance, by not knowing when one ought to cohabit with his wife, as if she be pure from her discharge.&#160; Now the afflictions which you mentioned before are the result of ignorance, and not, assuredly, of any wickedness that has been perpetrated.&#160; Moreover, give me the man who sins not, and I will show you the man who suffers not; and you will find that he not only does not suffer himself, but that he is able&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1469"></A><A HREF="#fn_1469"><FONT SIZE="1">1470</FONT></A>
 to heal others.&#160; For instance, Moses, on account of his <A NAME="page_338"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 338</FONT></A> <a name="vi.iv.xxii.xxii-Page_338"></A>piety, continued free from suffering all his life, and by his prayers he healed the Egyptians when they suffered on account of their sins.&#8221;</p>
