id="vii.vi.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 2.</span>

<span id="vii.vi.ii-p2"></span>And it came to pass that the festival of
the dedication <span id="fr_1690"></span>[1691](#fn_1690.md) was at hand;
wherefore also Joachim went up to Jerusalem with some men of his own
tribe.  Now at that time Issachar <span
id="fr_1691"></span>[1692](#fn_1691.md) was high priest there.  And when he
saw Joachim with his offering among his other fellow-citizens, he
despised him, and spurned his gifts, asking why he, who had no
offspring, presumed to stand among those who had; saying that his gifts
could not by any means be acceptable to God, since He had deemed him
unworthy of off-spring:  for the Scripture said, Cursed is every one who
has not begot a male or a female in Israel. <span
id="fr_1692"></span>[1693](#fn_1692.md)   He said, therefore, that he ought
first to be freed from this curse by the begetting of children; and
then, and then only, that he should come into the presence of the Lord
with his offerings.  And Joachim, covered with shame from this reproach
that was thrown in his teeth, retired to the shepherds, who were in
their pastures with their flocks; nor would he return home, lest
perchance he might be branded with the same reproach by those of his own
tribe, who were there at the time, and had heard this from the priest.

There is no Issachar in the list of high priests.

Scripture in so many words; but sterility was looked upon as a
punishment from God.
