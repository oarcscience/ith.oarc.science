<span id="vi.iv.xviii.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.xviii.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.—Providence Seen in the
Events of the Life of Faustus and His Family.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xviii.iv-p2"></span>“But I maintain, from what has
happened to you, <span id="fr_1223"></span>[1224](#fn_1223.md) that all
things are managed by the providence of God, and that your separation
from your family for so many years was providential; <span
id="fr_1224"></span>[1225](#fn_1224.md) for since, if they had been with
you, they perhaps would not have listened to the doctrines of the true
religion, it was arranged that your children should travel with their
mother, should be shipwrecked, should be supposed to have perished, and
should be sold; <span id="fr_1225"></span>[1226](#fn_1225.md) moreover,
that they should be educated in the learning of the Greeks, especially
in the atheistic doctrines, in order that, as being acquainted with
them, they might be the better able to refute them; and in addition to
this, that they should become attached to the true religion, and be
enabled to be united with me, so as to help me in my preaching;
furthermore, that their brother Clement should meet in the same place,
and that thus his mother should be recognised, and through her
cure <span id="fr_1226"></span>[1227](#fn_1226.md) should be fully
convinced of the right worship of God; <span
id="fr_1227"></span>[1228](#fn_1227.md) that after no long interval the
twins should recognise and be recognised, and the other day should fall
in with you, and that you should receive back your own.  I do not think,
then, that such a speedy filling in of circumstances, coming as it were
from all quarters, so as to accomplish one design, could have happened
without the direction of Providence.”
