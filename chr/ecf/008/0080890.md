<span id="vi.iv.xii.vii-p2"></span>“But they did not cease to worship
images, <span id="fr_1111"></span>[1112](#fn_1111) by reason of the evil
intelligence of the magicians, who found excuses for them, which had
power to constrain them to the foolish worship.  For, establishing this
things by magical ceremonies, they assigned them feasts from sacrifices,
libations, flutes, and shoutings, by means of which senseless men, being
deceived, and their kingdom being taken from them, yet did not desist
from the worship that they had taken up with.  To such an extent did
they prefer error, on account of its pleasantness, before truth.  They
also howl after their sacrificial surfeit, their soul from the depth, as
it were by dreams, forewarning them of the punishment that is to befall
such deeds of theirs.
