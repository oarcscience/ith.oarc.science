<span id="vi.iv.xvi.v-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.xvi.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V.—Mattidia Wishes to Be
Baptized.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xvi.v-p2"></span>When she heard this, she said:  “What,
then, prevents me from being baptized this day? for before I saw you I
turned away from the so-called gods, induced by the thought that, though
I sacrificed much to them almost every day, they did not aid me in my
necessities.  And with regard to adultery, what need I say? for not even
when I was rich was I betrayed into this sin by luxury, and the poverty
which succeeded has been unable to force me into it, since I cling to my
chastity as constituting the greatest beauty, <span
id="fr_1162"></span>[1163](#fn_1162) on account of which I fell into so
great distress.  But I do not at all imagine that you, my lord Peter,
are ignorant that the greatest temptation <span
id="fr_1163"></span>[1164](#fn_1163) arises when everything looks
bright.  And therefore, if I was chaste in my prosperity, I do not in my
despondency give myself up to pleasures.  Yea, indeed, you are not to
suppose that my soul has now been freed from distress, although it has
received some measure of consolation by the recognition of Clement.  For
the gloom which I feel in consequence of the loss of my two children
rushes in upon me, and throws its shadow to some extent over my joy; for
I am grieved, not so much because they perished in the sea, but because
they were destroyed, both soul and body, without possessing true <span
id="fr_1164"></span>[1165](#fn_1164) piety towards God.  Moreover, my
husband, their father, as I have learned from Clement, went away in
search of me and his sons, and for so many years has not been heard of;
and, without doubt, he must have died.  For the miserable man, loving me
as he did in chastity, was fond of his children; and therefore the old
man, deprived of all of us who were dear to him above everything else,
died utterly broken-hearted.”

<span id="vi.iv.xvi.v-p5"></span> The Greek has, “apart from divine
piety towards God.”  As Wieseler remarks, the epithet “divine” is
corrupt.  The meaning may be, “without having known the proper mode of
worshipping God.”
