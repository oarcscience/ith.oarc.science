Tripolis, Peter rising and finding us awake, saluted us and went out to
the reservoir, that he might bathe and pray; and we also did so after
him.  To us, therefore, when we had prayed together, and were set down
before him, he gave a discourse touching the necessity of purity.  And
when thereafter it was day, he permitted the multitudes to enter.  Then,
when a great crowd had entered, he saluted them according to custom, and
began to speak.
