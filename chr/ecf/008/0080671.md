id="vi.iv.v.xxxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXVIII.—Corruption of the
Law.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.v.xxxviii-p2"></span>“For the Scriptures have had joined
to them many falsehoods against God on this account.  The prophet Moses
having by the order of God delivered the law, with the explanations, to
certain chosen men, some seventy in number, in order that they also
might instruct such of the people as chose, after a little the written
law had added to it certain falsehoods contrary to the law of God, <span
id="fr_945"></span>[946](#fn_945) who made the heaven and the earth, and
all things in them; the wicked one having dared to work this for some
righteous purpose.  And this took place in reason and judgment, that
those might be convicted who should dare to listen to the things written
against God, and those who, through love towards Him, should not only
disbelieve the things spoken against Him, but should not even endure to
hear them at all, even if they should happen to be true, judging it much
safer to incur danger with respect to religious faith, than to live with
an evil conscience on account of blasphemous words.
