<span id="vi.iv.ix.v-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.ix.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V.—Kronos and Rhea Explained.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.ix.v-p2"></span>“Now you must think of Kronos as time
(<span class="c9"><span id="vi.iv.ix.v-p2.1"></span>chronos</span>), and
Rhea as the flowing (<span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iv.ix.v-p2.2"></span>rheon</span>) of the watery substance. <span
id="fr_1063"></span>[1064](#fn_1063.md)   For the whole body of matter was
borne about for some <span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iv.ix.v-p3.1"></span>Time</span>, before it brought forth, like
an egg, the sphere-like, all-embracing heaven (<span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iv.ix.v-p3.2"></span>ouranos</span>), which at first was full of
productive marrow, so that it was able to produce out of itself elements
and colours of all sorts, while from the one substance and the one
colour it produced all kinds of forms.  For as a peacock’s egg seems to
have only one colour, while potentially it has in it all the colours of
the animal that is to be, so this living egg, conceived out of infinite
matter, when set in motion by the underlying and ever-flowing matter,
produces many different forms.  For within the circumference a certain
living creature, which is both male and female, is formed by the skill
of the indwelling divine spirit.  This Orpheus calls Phanes, because
when it appeared (<span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iv.ix.v-p3.3"></span>phaneis</span>) the universe shone forth
from it, with the lustre of that most glorious of the elements, fire,
perfected in moisture.  Nor is this incredible, since in glowworms
nature gives us to see a moist light.
