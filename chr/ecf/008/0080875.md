<span id="vi.iv.xi.xvii-p2"></span>“But by the shedding of much blood,
the pure air being defiled with impure vapour, and sickening those who
breathed it, rendered them liable to diseases, so that thenceforth men
died prematurely.  But the earth being by these means greatly defiled,
these first teemed with poison-darting and deadly creatures.  All
things, therefore, going from bad to worse, on account of these brutal
demons, God wished to cast them away like an evil leaven, lest each
generation from a wicked seed, being like to that before it, and equally
impious, should empty the world to come of saved men.  And for this
purpose, having warned a certain righteous man, <span
id="fr_1101"></span>[1102](#fn_1101.md) with his three sons, together with
their wives and their children, to save themselves in an ark, He sent a
deluge of water, that all being destroyed, the purified world might be
handed over to him who was saved in the ark, in order to a second
beginning of life.  And thus it came to pass.
