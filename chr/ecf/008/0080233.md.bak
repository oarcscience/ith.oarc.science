<span id="vi.iii.v.xxiii-p2"></span>But when the day began to be light,
after prayer he went out to the crowds and stood in his accustomed
place, for the discussion; and seeing Simon standing in the middle of
the crowd, he saluted the people in his usual way, and said to them:  “I
confess that I am grieved with respect to some men, who come to us in
this way that they may learn something, but when we begin to teach them,
they profess that they themselves are masters, and while indeed they ask
questions as ignorant persons, they contradict as knowing ones.  But
perhaps some one will say, that he who puts a question, puts it indeed
in order that he may learn, but when that which he hears does not seem
to him to be right, it is necessary that he should answer, and that
seems to be contradiction which is not contradiction, but further
inquiry.
