id="vi.iv.iii.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XV.—Incidents of the
Voyage.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.iii.xv-p2"></span>“Let therefore the passengers remain
quiet, sitting in their own places, lest by disorder they occasion
rolling or careening.  Let the midshipmen give heed to the fare.  Let
the deacons neglect nothing with which they are entrusted; let the
presbyters, like sailors, studiously arrange what is needful for each
one.  Let the bishop, as the mate, wakefully ponder the words of the
pilot alone.  Let Christ, even the Saviour, be loved as the pilot, and
alone believed in the matters of which He speaks; and let all pray to
God for a prosperous voyage.  Let those sailing expect every
tribulation, as travelling over a great and troubled sea, the world: 
sometimes, indeed, disheartened, persecuted, dispersed, hungry, thirsty,
naked, hemmed in; and, again, sometimes united, congregated, at rest;
but also sea-sick, giddy, vomiting, that is, confessing sins, like
disease-producing bile,—I mean the sins proceeding from bitterness, and
the evils accumulated from disorderly lusts, by the confession of which,
as by vomiting, you are relieved of your disease, attaining healthful
safety by means of carefulness.
