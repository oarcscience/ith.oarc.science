<span id="vii.xvii.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vii.xvii.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 7 (23).</span>

<span id="vii.xvii.vii-p2"></span>And again there came the voice of the
Son of the Father most high, as it were the voice of a great thunder,
saying:  Lift up your gates, ye princes; and be ye lifted up, ye
everlasting gates, and the King of glory will come in.  Then Satan and
Hades cried out, saying:  Who is the king of glory?  And it was answered
to them in the voice of the Lord:  The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord
mighty in battle.

<span id="vii.xvii.vii-p3"></span>After this voice there came a man,
whose appearance was that of a robber, carrying a cross on his shoulder,
crying from the outside of the door, and saying:  Open to me, that I may
come in.  And Satan, opening to him a little, brought him inside into
his dwelling, <span id="fr_2009"></span>[2010](#fn_2009.md) and again shut
the door after him.  And all the saints saw him most clearly, and said
to him forthwith:  Thy appearance is that of a robber.  Tell us what it
is that thou carriest on thy back.  And he answered, and said with
humility:  Truly I was a robber altogether; and the Jews hung me up on a
cross, along with my Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father most
high.  I, in fine, have come heralding <span
id="fr_2010"></span>[2011](#fn_2010.md) Him; He indeed is coming
immediately behind me.

<span id="vii.xvii.vii-p6"></span>Then holy David, inflamed with anger
against Satan, cried out aloud:  Open thy gates, most vile wretch, that
the King of glory may come in.  In like manner also all the saints of
God rose up against Satan, and would have seized him, and divided him
among them.  And again a cry was heard within:  Lift up your gates, ye
princes; and be ye lifted up, ye everlasting gates; and the King of
glory shall come in.  Hades and Satan, at that clear voice, again asked,
saying:  Who is this king of glory?  And it was said to them by that
wonderful voice:  The Lord of powers, He is the King of glory.
