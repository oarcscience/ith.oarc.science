<span id="vi.iv.xxii.xx-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.xxii.xx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XX.—Pain and Death the Result of
Sin.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxii.xx-p2"></span>And Peter said:  “We remember that
our Lord and Teacher, commanding us, said, ‘Keep the mysteries for me
and the sons of my house.’  Wherefore also He explained to His disciples
privately the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven. <span
id="fr_1457"></span>[1458](#fn_1457)   But to you who do battle with us,
and examine into nothing else but our statements, whether they be true
or false, it would be impious to state the hidden *truths*.  But that
none of the bystanders may imagine that I am contriving excuses, <span
id="fr_1458"></span>[1459](#fn_1458) because I am unable to reply to the
assertions made by you, I shall answer you by first putting the
question, If there had been a state of painlessness, what is the meaning
of the statement, ‘The evil one was?’”  And Simon said:  “The words have
no meaning.”  And Peter:  “Is then evil the same as pain and death?” 
And Simon:  “It seems so.”  And Peter said:  “Evil, then, does not exist
always, yea, it can<span id="page_337">p. 337</span> <span
id="vi.iv.xxii.xx-Page_337"></span>not even exist at all substantially;
for pain and death belong to the class of accidents, neither of which
can co-exist with abiding strength.  For what is pain but the
interruption of harmony?  And what is death but the separation of soul
from body?  There is therefore no pain when there is harmony.  For death
does not even at all belong to those things which substantially exist: 
for death is nothing, as I said, but the separation of soul from body;
and when this takes place, the body, which is by nature incapable of
sensation, is dissolved; but the soul, being capable of sensation,
remains in life and exists substantially.  Hence, when there is harmony
there is no pain, no death, no, not even deadly plants nor poisonous
reptiles, nor anything of such a nature that its end is death.  And
hence, where immortality reigns, all things will appear to have been
made with reason.  And this will be the case when, on account of
righteousness, man becomes immortal through the prevalence of the
peaceful reign of Christ, when his composition will be so well arranged
as not *to give rise* <span id="fr_1459"></span>[1460](#fn_1459) to
sharp impulses; and his knowledge, moreover, will be unerring, so as
that he shall not *mistake* <span id="fr_1460"></span>[1461](#fn_1460)
evil for good; and he will suffer no pain, so that he will not be
mortal.” <span id="fr_1461"></span>[1462](#fn_1461)
