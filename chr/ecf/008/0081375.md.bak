<span id="vii.xxxiii.ii.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vii.xxxiii.ii.iv-p1.1"></span>About the Young Man Who Killed the
Maiden.</span>

<span id="vii.xxxiii.ii.iv-p2"></span>And there was a certain young man
who had done a nefarious deed; and having come to the apostle, he took
the bread of the Eucharist into his mouth, and his two hands immediately
withered, so that he could no longer bring them to his mouth.  And those
who were present and saw him told the apostle what had happened.  And
he, having summoned him, said:  Tell me, my child, and be ashamed of
nothing, <span id="fr_2377"></span>[2378](#fn_2377.md) what thou hast done,
and why thou hast come hither; for the Eucharist of the Lord has
convicted thee.  For this gracious gift coming to many is especially
healing to those who approach it through faith and love; but thee it has
withered away, and what has happened has happened not without some
working cause.  And the young man who had been convicted by the
Eucharist of the Lord came up, and fell at the apostle’s feet, and
prayed him, saying:  An evil deed has been done by me, yet I thought to
do something good.  I was <span id="page_547">p. 547</span> <span
id="vii.xxxiii.ii.iv-Page_547"></span>in love with a certain woman
living outside of the city in an inn, and she loved me.  And I having
heard from thee, and believed that thou proclaimest the living God, came
and received the seal from thee along with the others; and thou saidst,
Whoever shall indulge in filthy intercourse, and especially in adultery,
shall not have life with the God whom I proclaim. <span
id="fr_2378"></span>[2379](#fn_2378.md)   Since, then, I altogether loved
her, I begged of her, and persuaded her to live with me in chaste and
pure intercourse, as thou thyself teachest; but she would not.  When
therefore she would not, I took a sword and killed her; for I could not
see her living in adultery with another.

<span id="vii.xxxiii.ii.iv-p5"></span>The apostle, having heard this,
said:  O maddening intercourse, into what shamelessness dost thou lead! 
O unrestrained lust, how hast thou brought him into subjection to do
this!  O work of the serpent, how dost thou rage in thine own!  And the
apostle ordered water to be brought him in a dish.  And when the water
had been brought, he said:  Come waters from the living waters, existing
from the existing, and sent to us; the fountain sent to us from repose,
the power of salvation coming from that power that subdues all things,
and subjects them to its own will; come and dwell in these waters, that
the gracious gift of the Holy Spirit may be fully perfected in them. 
And he said to the young man:  Go, wash thy hands in these waters.  And
when he had washed, they were restored.  And the apostle said to him: 
Dost thou believe in our Lord Jesus Christ, that He can do all things? 
And he said:  Even though I am least of all, I believe; but this I did,
thinking to do a good thing:  for I implored her, as also I told thee;
but she would not be persuaded by me to keep herself chaste.

<span id="vii.xxxiii.ii.iv-p6"></span>And the apostle said to him: 
Come, let us go to the inn where thou didst this deed, and let us see
what has happened.  And the young man went before the apostle on the
road; and when they came to the inn, they found her lying.  And the
apostle, seeing her, was disheartened, for she was a beautiful maiden;
and he ordered her to be brought into the middle of the inn.  And having
put her on a couch, they brought it, and set it in the midst of the
court-yard of the inn.  And the apostle laid his hand on her, and began
to say:  Jesus, who always appearest to us—for this Thou always wishest,
that we should seek Thee—and Thou Thyself hast given us this power of
asking and receiving; <span id="fr_2379"></span>[2380](#fn_2379.md) and not
only hast Thou given us this, but hast also taught us how to pray; <span
id="fr_2380"></span>[2381](#fn_2380.md) who art not seen by bodily eyes,
but who art not altogether hidden from those of our soul, and who art
hidden in Thy form, but manifested to us by Thy works; and by Thy many
deeds we have recognised Thee as we go on, and Thou hast given us Thy
gifts without measure, saying, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and
ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you. <span
id="fr_2381"></span>[2382](#fn_2381.md)   We pray, therefore, having
suspicion of our sins; <span id="fr_2382"></span>[2383](#fn_2382.md) and we
ask of Thee not riches, nor gold, nor silver, nor possessions, nor any
of those things that come from the earth and go into the earth again;
but this we beg of Thee, and entreat that in Thy holy name Thou raise
this woman lying here by Thy power, to the glory and faith of those
standing by.

<span id="vii.xxxiii.ii.iv-p11"></span>And when he had thus prayed, he
sealed the young man, and said to him:  Go, and take her by the hand,
and say to her, I through my hands killed thee with the sword; <span
id="fr_2383"></span>[2384](#fn_2383.md) and again I raise thee by my hands,
in the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ.  And the young man went and stood
by her, saying:  I have believed in Thee, O Christ Jesus.  And looking
upon Judas Thomas the apostle, he said to him:  Pray for me, that my
Lord, upon whom also I call, may come to my help.  And having laid his
hand on her hand, he said:  Come, Lord Jesus Christ, giving this woman
life, and me the earnest of Thy faith.  And immediately, as he drew her
hand, she sprang up, and sat, looking at the great multitude standing
round.  And she also saw the apostle standing opposite to her; and
having left the couch, she sprang up, and fell at his feet, and took
hold of his garments, saying:  I pray thee, my lord, where is that other
who is with thee, who has not left me to remain in that fearful and
grievous place, but has given me up to thee, saying, Do thou take her,
that she may be made perfect, and thereafter brought into her own place?

<span id="vii.xxxiii.ii.iv-p13"></span>And the apostle says to her: 
Tell us where thou hast been.  And she answered:  Dost thou, who wast
with me, to whom also I was entrusted, wish to hear?  And she began to
say:  A certain man received me, hateful in appearance, all black, and
his clothing exceedingly filthy; and he led me away to a place where
there were many chasms, and a great stench and most hateful odour were
given forth thence; and he made me bend down into each chasm, and I saw
in the chasm blazing fire; and wheels of fire ran there, and souls were
hung upon those wheels, and were dashed against each other.  And there
was there crying and great lamentation, and there was none released. 
And that man said to me, These souls are of thine own nation, and for a
certain number of days <span id="fr_2384"></span>[2385](#fn_2384.md) they
have been given over to punishment and torture; and then <span
id="page_548">p. 548</span> <span
id="vii.xxxiii.ii.iv-Page_548"></span>others are brought in instead of
them; and likewise also these are again succeeded by others.  These are
they who have exchanged the intercourse of man and wife.  And again I
looked down, and saw infants heaped upon each other, and struggling and
lying upon each other; and he answered and said to me, These are their
children, and for this have they been placed here for a testimony
against them.

<span id="vii.xxxiii.ii.iv-p15"></span>And he brought me to another
chasm, and I bent down and saw mud, and worms spouting forth, and souls
wallowing there; and a great gnashing of teeth was heard thence from
them.  And that man said to me, These are the souls of women that left
their own husbands, and went and committed adultery with others, and who
have been brought to this torment.  He showed me another chasm, into
which I bent down and saw souls hung up, some by the tongue, some by the
hair, some by the hands, some by the feet, head downwards, and smoked
with smoke and sulphur; about whom that man who was with me answered me,
These souls which are hung up by the tongue are slanderers, and such as
have uttered false and disgraceful words; *those that are hung up by the
hair* <span id="fr_2385"></span>[2386](#fn_2385.md) are those that are
shameless, and that have gone about with uncovered heads in the world;
these hung up by the hands are those who have taken what belongs to
others, and have stolen, and who have never given anything to the poor,
nor assisted the afflicted; but they so acted, wishing to get
everything, and giving no heed at all to justice and the laws; and these
hung up by the feet are those who lightly and eagerly ran in wicked
ways, and disorderly wickedness, not looking after the sick, and not
aiding those departing this life, and on account of this each individual
soul is requited for what has been done by it.

<span id="vii.xxxiii.ii.iv-p17"></span>Again leading me away, he showed
me a cavern, exceedingly dark, exhaling a great stench; and many souls
were peeping out thence, wishing to get some share of the air, but their
keepers would not let them peep out.  And he who was with me said, This
is the prison of those souls which thou seest; for when they shall
complete their punishments for those things which each one has done,
afterwards again others succeed them—and there are some also quite used
up—and are given up to other punishments.  Those, then, who guarded the
souls that were in the dark cave said to the man that had charge of me,
Give her to us, that we may take her in beside the others, until the
time comes for her to be given up to punishment.  And he answered them,
I will not give her to you, for I am afraid of him who gave her up to
me; for I received no orders to leave her here, and I shall take her up
with me until I get some injunction about her.  And he took me and
brought me to another place, in which were men who were bitterly
tortured.  And he that is like thee took me and gave me up to thee,
having thus said to thee, Take her, since she is one of the creatures
that have been led astray.  And I was taken by thee, and am now before
thee.  I beg, therefore, and supplicate thee that I may not go into
those places of punishment which I saw.

<span id="vii.xxxiii.ii.iv-p18"></span>And the apostle said to the
multitudes standing by:  You have heard, brethren, what this woman has
recounted; and these are not the only punishments, but there are others
worse than these; and if you do not turn to this God whom I proclaim,
and refrain from your former works and deeds which you have done without
knowledge, in these punishments you shall have your end.  Believe,
therefore, in our Lord Jesus Christ, and He will forgive you the sins
done by you heretofore, and will purify you from all the bodily desires
that abide in the earth, and will heal you from the faults that follow
after you, and go along with you, and are found before you.  And let
each of you put off the old man, and put on the new, and leave your
former course of conduct and behaviour; and let those that steal steal
no more, but let them live, labouring and working; <span
id="fr_2386"></span>[2387](#fn_2386.md) and let the adulterers no more
commit adultery, lest they give themselves up to everlasting punishment;
for adultery is with God an evil altogether grievous above other evils. 
Put away also from yourselves covetousness, and lying, and drunkenness,
and slandering, and requiting evil for evil:  for all these are alien
and strange to the God proclaimed by us; but rather live in faith, and
meekness, and holiness, and hope, in which God rejoices, that ye may
become His servants, having received from Him gracious gifts, which few
or none receive.

<span id="vii.xxxiii.ii.iv-p20"></span>All the people therefore
believed, and presented their souls obedient to the living God and
Christ Jesus, enjoying His blessed works, and His holy service.  And
they brought much money for the service of the widows; for he had them
collected in the cities, and he sent to all of them by his own
servants <span id="fr_2387"></span>[2388](#fn_2387.md) what was necessary,
both clothing and food.  But he did not cease proclaiming and saying to
them, and showing that this is Jesus the Christ, concerning whom the
Scriptures proclaimed that He should come, and be crucified, and be
raised from the dead after three days.  And he showed them a second
time, beginning from the prophets, and explaining the things concerning
Christ, and that it was necessary for Him to come, and for all things to
<span id="page_549">p. 549</span> <span
id="vii.xxxiii.ii.iv-Page_549"></span>be fulfilled that had been said to
us beforehand concerning Him. <span id="fr_2388"></span>[2389](#fn_2388.md)

<span id="vii.xxxiii.ii.iv-p23"></span>And the report of him ran through
all the cities and countries; and all who had persons sick or tormented
by unclean spirits brought them, and they were healed.  Some also they
laid on the road by which he was to pass, and he healed them all by the
power of the Lord. <span id="fr_2389"></span>[2390](#fn_2389.md)   Then
said all with one accord who had been healed by him, with one voice: 
Glory to Thee, Jesus, who givest Thy healing to all alike by means of
Thy servant and apostle Thomas.  And being in good health, and
rejoicing, we pray Thee that we may be of Thy flock, and be numbered
among Thy sheep; receive us, therefore, O Lord, and consider not our
transgressions and former offences which we did, being in ignorance.

<span id="vii.xxxiii.ii.iv-p25"></span>And the apostle said:  Glory to
the only-begotten from the Father; <span
id="fr_2390"></span>[2391](#fn_2390.md) glory to the first-born of many
brethren; <span id="fr_2391"></span>[2392](#fn_2391.md) Glory to Thee, the
defender and helper of those who come to Thy place of refuge; Thou that
sleepest not, and raisest those that are asleep; that livest and
bringest to life those that are lying in death; O God Jesus Christ, Son
of the living God, redeemer and helper, refuge and rest of all that
labour in Thy work, who affordest health to those who for Thy name’s
sake bear the burden of the day, and the icy coldness of the night; we
give thanks for the gracious gifts that have been given us by Thee, and
for the help from Thee bestowed upon us, and Thy providential care that
has come upon us from Thee.  Perfect these things upon us, therefore,
unto the end, that we may have confidence in Thee; look upon us, because
for Thy sake we have left our homes, and for Thy sake have become
strangers gladly and willingly; look upon us, O Lord, because for Thy
sake we have abandoned our possessions, that we may have Thee for a
possession that shall not be taken away; look upon us, O Lord, because
we have left those related to us by ties of kindred in order that we may
be united in relationship to Thee; look upon us, O Lord, who have left
our fathers and mothers, and those that nourished us, that we may behold
Thy Father, and be satisfied with His divine nourishment:  look upon us,
O Lord, because for Thy sake we have left our bodily yoke-fellows, <span
id="fr_2392"></span>[2393](#fn_2392.md) and our earthly fruit, in order
that we may share in that intercourse which is lasting and true, and
bring forth true fruits, whose nature is from above, the enjoyment of
which no one can take away from us, with which we abide, and they abide
with us.
