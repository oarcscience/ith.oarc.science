id="vi.iii.v.xlviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter LVIII.—Truth Veiled with
Love.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.v.xlviii-p2"></span>Then said Peter:  “I take it well
that you bring the truth to the rule, and do not suffer hindrances of
faith to lurk in your soul.  For thus you can easily obtain the remedy. 
Do you remember that I said, that the worst of all things is when any
one neglects to learn what is for his good?”  Niceta answered:  “I
remember.”  Then Peter:  “And again, that God has veiled His truth, that
He may disclose it to those who faithfully follow Him?”  “Neither,” said
Niceta, “have I forgotten this.”  Then said Peter:  “What think you
then?  That God has buried His truth deep in the earth, and has heaped
mountains upon it, that it may be found by those only who are able to
dig down into the depths?  It is not so; but as He has surrounded the
mountains and the earth with the expanse of heaven, so hath He veiled
the truth with the curtain of His own love, that he alone may be able to
reach it, who has first knocked at the gate of divine love.
