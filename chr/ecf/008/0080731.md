<span id="vi.iv.vi.xliv-p2"></span>“But what?  Does not Moses
pre-intimate the sins of the people, and predict their dispersion among
the nations?  But if He gave foreknowledge to Moses, how can it be that
He had it not Himself?  But He has it.  And if He has it, as we have
also shown, it is an extravagant saying that He reflected, and that He
repented, <span id="page_247">p. 247</span> <span
id="vi.iv.vi.xliv-Page_247"></span>and that He went down to see, and
whatever else of this sort.  Whatsoever things being fore-known before
they come to pass as about to befall, take issue by a wise economy,
without repentance.
