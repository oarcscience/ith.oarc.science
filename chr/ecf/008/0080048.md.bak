<span id="v.iv.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter IX.—Samson’s Admonitory Fall.</span>

<span id="v.iv.ix-p2"></span>Hast thou not heard concerning Samson the
Nazarite, “with whom was the Spirit of God,” <span
id="fr_473"></span>[474](#fn_473.md) the man of great strength?  This man,
who was a Nazarite, and consecrated to God, and who was *gifted* with
strength and might, a woman brought to ruin with *her* wretched body,
and with *her* vile passion.  Art thou, perchance, such a man as he? 
Know thyself, and know the measure of <span id="page_64">p. 64</span>
<span id="v.iv.ix-Page_64"></span>thy strength. <span
id="fr_474"></span>[475](#fn_474.md)   “The married woman catcheth precious
souls.” <span id="fr_475"></span>[476](#fn_475.md)   Therefore, we do not
allow any man whatsoever to sit with a married woman; much less to live
in the same house with a maiden who has taken the vow, or to sleep where
she sleeps, or to be constantly with her.  For this is to be hated and
abominated by those who fear God.
