id="vi.iii.iii.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIII.—His Cordial Reception by
Peter.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iii.xiii-p2"></span>But Peter most kindly, when he
heard my name, immediately ran to me and kissed me.  Then, having made
me sit down, he said, “Thou didst well to receive as thy guest Barnabas,
preacher of the truth, nothing fearing the rage of the insane people. 
Thou shalt be blessed.  For as you have deemed an ambassador of the
truth worthy of all honour, so the truth herself shall receive thee a
wanderer and a stranger, and shall enroll thee a citizen of her own
city; and then there shall be great joy to thee, because, imparting a
small favour, thou shalt be written heir of eternal blessings.  Now,
therefore, do not trouble yourself to explain your mind to me; for
Barnabas has with faithful speech informed me of all things about you
and your dispositions, almost daily and without ceasing, recalling the
memory of your good qualities.  And to point out to you shortly, as to a
friend already of one mind with us, what is your best course; if there
is nothing to hinder you, come along with us, and hear the word of the
truth, which we are going to speak in every place until we come even to
the city of Rome; and now, if you wish anything, speak.”
