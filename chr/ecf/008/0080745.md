id="vi.iv.vi.lviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter LVIII.—Flight of Simon.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.vi.lviii-p2"></span>Therefore Simon, perceiving that
Peter was driving him to use the Scriptures as Jesus taught, was
unwilling that the discussion should go into the doctrine concerning
God, even although Peter had changed the discussion into question and
answer, as Simon himself asked.  However, the discussion occupied three
days. <span id="fr_1018"></span>[1019](#fn_1018)   And while the fourth
was dawning, he set off darkling as far as Tyre of Phœnicia. <span
id="fr_1019"></span>[1020](#fn_1019)   And not many days after, some of
the precursors came and said to Peter:  “Simon is doing great miracles
in Tyre, and disturbing many of the people there; and by many slanders
he has made you to be hated.”
