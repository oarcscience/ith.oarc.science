<span id="vii.vi.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vii.vi.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 7.</span>

<span id="vii.vi.vii-p2"></span>But the virgin of the Lord advanced in
age and in virtues; and though, in the words of the Psalmist, her father
and mother had forsaken her, the Lord took her up. <span
id="fr_1696"></span>[1697](#fn_1696)   For daily was she visited by
angels, daily did she enjoy a divine vision, which preserved her from
all evil, and made her to abound in all good.  And so she reached her
fourteenth year; and not only were the wicked unable to charge her with
anything worthy of reproach, but all the good, who knew her life and
conversation, judged her to be worthy of admiration.  Then the high
priest publicly announced that the virgins who were publicly settled in
the temple, and had reached this time of life, should return home and
get married, according to the custom of the nation and the ripeness of
their years.  The others readily obeyed this command; but Mary alone,
the virgin of the Lord, answered that she could not do this, saying both
that her parents had devoted her to the service of the Lord, and <span
id="page_386">p. 386</span> <span id="vii.vi.vii-Page_386"></span>that,
moreover, she herself had made to the Lord a vow of virginity, which she
would never violate by any intercourse with man.  And the high priest,
being placed in great perplexity of mind, seeing that neither did he
think that the vow should be broken contrary to the Scripture, which
says, Vow and pay, <span id="fr_1697"></span>[1698](#fn_1697) nor did he
dare to introduce a custom unknown to the nation, gave order that at the
festival, which was at hand, all the chief persons from Jerusalem and
the neighbourhood should be present, in order that from their advice he
might know what was to be done in so doubtful a case.  And when this
took place, they resolved unanimously that the Lord should be consulted
upon this matter.  And when they all bowed themselves in prayer, the
high priest went to consult God in the usual way.  Nor had they long to
wait:  in the hearing of all a voice issued from the oracle and from the
mercy-seat, that, according to the prophecy of Isaiah, a man should be
sought out to whom the virgin ought to be entrusted and espoused.  For
it is clear that Isaiah says:  A rod shall come forth from the root of
Jesse, and a flower shall ascend from his root; and the Spirit of the
Lord shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the
spirit of counsel and strength, the spirit of wisdom and piety; and he
shall be filled with the spirit of the fear of the Lord. <span
id="fr_1698"></span>[1699](#fn_1698)   According to this prophecy,
therefore, he predicted that all of the house and family of David that
were unmarried and fit for marriage should bring there rods to the
altar; and that he whose rod after it was brought should produce a
flower, and upon the end of whose rod the Spirit of the Lord should
settle in the form of a dove, was the man to whom the virgin ought to be
entrusted and espoused.
