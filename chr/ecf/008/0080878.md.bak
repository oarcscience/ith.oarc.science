id="vi.iv.xi.xx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XX.—Willing Captives.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xi.xx-p2"></span>“Having charged them to this effect,
the angel departed.  But you are still ignorant of this law, that every
one who worships demons, or sacrifices to them, or partakes with them of
their table, shall become subject to them and receive all punishment
from them, as being under wicked lords.  And you who, on account of
ignorance of this *law*, have been corrupted beside their altars, <span
id="fr_1102"></span>[1103](#fn_1102.md) and have been satiated with *food
offered to* them, have come under their power, and do not know how you
have been in every way injured in respect of your bodies.  But you ought
to know that the demons have no power over any one, unless first he be
their table-companion; since not even their chief can do anything
contrary to the law imposed upon them by God, wherefore he has no power
over any one who does not worship him; but neither can any one receive
from them any of the things that he wishes, nor in anything be hurt by
them, as you may learn from the following statement.
