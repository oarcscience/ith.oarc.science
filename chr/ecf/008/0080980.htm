<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xv.ix-p2"></A>&#8220;Therefore my father, being fond of his children, supplying them suitably for the journey with male and female servants, put them on board ship, and sent them to Athens with her to be educated, and kept me alone of his sons with him for his comfort; and for this I am very thankful, that the vision had not ordered me also to depart with my mother from the city of Rome.&#160; Then, after the lapse of a year, my father sent money to them to Athens, and at the same time to learn how they did.&#160; But those who went on this errand did not return.&#160; And in the third year, my father being distressed, sent others in like manner with supplies, and they returned in the fourth year with the tidings that they had seen neither my mother nor my brothers, nor had they ever arrived at Athens, nor had they found any trace of any one of those who set out with them.</p>
