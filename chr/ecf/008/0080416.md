Providence.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.x.x-p2"></span>Then the old man said:  “You are
following it out exceedingly well.”  Then Niceta:  “Now, then, we must
inquire concerning the method of the world; of which the first inquiry
is divided into two parts.  For it is asked whether it has been made or
not?  And if it has not been made, itself must be that Unbegotten from
which all things are.  But if it has been made, concerning this again
the question is divided into two parts, whether it was made by itself,
or by another.  And if indeed it was made by itself, then without doubt
providence is excluded.  If providence is not admitted, in vain is the
mind incited to virtue, in vain justice is maintained, if there be no
one to render to the just man according to his merits.  But even the
soul itself will not appear to be immortal, if there be no dispensation
of providence to receive it after its escape from the body.
