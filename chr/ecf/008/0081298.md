id="vii.xiv.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter 10 (26).</span>

<span id="vii.xiv.x-p2"></span>While they were thus speaking, there came
another lowly man, carry<span id="page_438">p. 438</span> <span
id="vii.xiv.x-Page_438"></span>ing also upon his shoulders a cross, to
whom the holy fathers said:  Who art thou, who hast the look of a
robber; and what is the cross which thou bearest upon thy shoulders?  He
answered:  I, as you say, was a robber and a thief in the world, and for
these things the Jews laid hold of me, and delivered me to the death of
the cross, along with our Lord Jesus Christ.  While, then, He was
hanging upon the cross, I, seeing the miracles that were done, believed
in Him, and entreated Him, and said, Lord, when Thou shalt be King, do
not forget me.  And immediately He said to me, Amen, amen:  to-day, I
say unto thee, shalt thou be with me in paradise.  Therefore I came to
paradise carrying my cross; and finding the archangel Michael, I said to
him, Our Lord Jesus, who has been crucified, has sent me here; bring me,
therefore, to the gate of Eden.  And the flaming sword, seeing the sign
of the cross, opened to me, and I went in.  Then the archangel says to
me, Wait a little, for there cometh also the forefather of the race of
men, Adam, with the just, that they too may come in.  And now, seeing
you, I came to meet you.

<span id="vii.xiv.x-p3"></span>The saints hearing these things, all
cried out with a loud voice:  Great is our Lord, and great is His
strength. <span id="fr_1951"></span>[1952](#fn_1951)
