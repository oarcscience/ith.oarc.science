<span id="vi.iii.xii.xv-p2"></span>Then I Clement went on to speak
thus:  “At Tripolis, when you were disputing against the Gentiles, my
lord Peter, I greatly wondered at you, that although you were instructed
by your father according to the fashion of the Hebrews and in
observances of your own law, and were never polluted by the studies of
Greek learning, you argued so magnificently and so incomparably; and
that you even touched upon some things concerning the histories of the
gods, which are usually declaimed in the theatres.  But as I perceived
that their fables and blasphemies are not so well known to you, I shall
discourse upon these in your hearing, repeating them from the very
beginning, if it please you.”  Then says Peter:  “Say on; you do well to
assist my preaching.”  Then said I:  “I shall speak, therefore, because
you order me, not by way of teaching you, but of making public what
foolish opinions the Gentiles entertain of the gods.”
