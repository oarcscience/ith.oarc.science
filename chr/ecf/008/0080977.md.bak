id="vi.iv.xv.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI.—Peter’s Frugality.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xv.vi-p2"></span>Then Peter, hearing, smiled and said,
“What think you, then, O Clement?  Do you not think that you are placed
by very necessity in the position of my servant?  For who else shall
take care of those many splendid tunics, with all my changes of rings
and sandals?  And who shall make ready those pleasant and artistic
dainties, which, being so various, need many skilful cooks, and all
those things which are procured with great eagerness, and are prepared
for the appetite of effeminate men as for some great wild beast? 
However, such a choice has occurred to you, perhaps, without you
understanding or knowing my manner of life, that I use only bread and
olives, and rarely pot-herbs; and that this is my only coat and cloak
which I wear; and I have no need of any of them, nor of aught else:  for
even in these I abound.  For my mind, seeing all the eternal good things
that are there, regards none of the things that are here.  However, I
accept of your good will; and I admire and commend you, for that you, a
man of refined habits, have so easily submitted your manner of living to
your necessities.  For we, from our childhood, both I and Andrew, my
brother, who is also my brother as respects God, not only being brought
up in the condition of orphans, but also accustomed to labour through
poverty and misfortune, easily bear the discomforts of our present
journeys.  Whence, if you would obey me, you would allow me, a working
man, to fulfil the part of a servant to you.”
