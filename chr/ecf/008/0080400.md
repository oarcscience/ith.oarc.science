id="vi.iii.ix.xxxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXIII.—Another Wreck
Prevented.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.ix.xxxiii-p2"></span>“But we adhered, for friendship’s
sake and boyish companionship, to one Simon, a magician, who was
educated along with us, so that we were almost deceived by him.  For
there is mention made in our religion of a certain Prophet, whose coming
was hoped for by all who observe that <span id="page_164">p. 164</span>
<span id="vi.iii.ix.xxxiii-Page_164"></span>religion, through whom
immortal and happy life is promised to be given to those who believe in
Him.  Now we thought that this Simon was he.  But these things shall be
explained to you, O mother, at a more convenient season.  Meanwhile,
when we were almost deceived by Simon, a certain colleague of my lord
Peter, Zacchæus by name, warned us that we should not be duped by the
magician, but presented us to Peter on his arrival, that by him we might
be taught the things which were sound and perfect.  And this we hope
will happen to you also, even as God has vouchsafed it to us, that we
may be able to eat and have a common table with you.  Thus therefore it
was, O mother, that you believed that we were drowned in the sea, while
we were stolen by pirates.”
