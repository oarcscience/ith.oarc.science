<span id="iv.viii.iv.x-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.iv.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter X</span>.—*Of the heresy of the
Messaliani*.

<span id="iv.viii.iv.x-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.iv.x-p2.1"></span>At</span> this time also arose the heresy
of the Messaliani. Those who translate their name into Greek call them
Euchitæ. <span id="fr_702"></span>[703](#fn_702)

<span id="iv.viii.iv.x-p4"></span>They have also another designation
which arose naturally from their mode of action. From their coming under
the influence of a certain demon, which they supposed to be the advent
of the Holy Ghost, they are called enthusiasts. <span
id="fr_703"></span>[704](#fn_703)

<span id="iv.viii.iv.x-p6"></span>Men who have become infected with this
plague to its full extent shun manual labour as iniquitous; and, giving
themselves over to sloth, call the imaginations of their dreams
prophesyings. Of this heresy Dadoes, Sabbas, Adelphius, Hermas, and
Simeones were leaders, and others besides, who did not hold aloof from
the communion of the Church, alleging that neither good nor harm came of
the divine food of which Christ our Master said “Whoso eateth my flesh
and drinketh my blood shall live for ever.” <span
id="fr_704"></span>[705](#fn_704)

<span id="iv.viii.iv.x-p8"></span>In their endeavor to hide their
unsoundness they shamelessly deny it even after conviction, and abjure
men whose opinions are in harmony with their own secret sentiments.

<span id="iv.viii.iv.x-p9"></span>Under these circumstances Letoius, who
was at the head of the church of Melitine, <span
id="fr_705"></span>[706](#fn_705) a man full of divine zeal, saw that
many monasteries, or, shall I rather say, brigands’ caves, had drunk
deep of this disease. He therefore burnt them, and drove out the wolves
from the flock.

<span id="iv.viii.iv.x-p11"></span>In like manner the illustrious
Amphilochius <span id="fr_706"></span>[707](#fn_706) to whom was
committed the charge of the metropolis of the Lycaonians and who ruled
all the people, no sooner learnt that this pestilence had invaded his
diocese than he made it depart from his borders and freed from its
infection the flocks he fed.

<span id="iv.viii.iv.x-p13"></span>Flavianus, <span
id="fr_707"></span>[708](#fn_707) also, the far famed high-priest of the
Antiochenes, on learning that these men were living at Edessa and
attacking with their peculiar poison all with whom <span
id="page_115">p. 115</span> <span id="iv.viii.iv.x-Page_115"></span>they
came in contact, sent a company of monks, brought them to Antioch, and
in the following manner convicted them in their denial of their heresy.
Their accusers, he said, were calumniating them, and the witnesses
giving false evidence; and Adelphius, who was a very old man, he
accosted with expressions of kindness, and ordered to take a seat at his
side. Then he said “We, O venerable sir, who have lived to an advanced
age, have more accurate knowledge of human nature, and of the tricks of
the demons who oppose us, and have learnt by experience the character of
the gift of grace. But these younger men have no clear knowledge of
these matters, and cannot brook to listen to spiritual teaching.
Wherefore tell me in what sense you say that the opposing spirit
retreats, and the grace of the Holy Ghost supervenes.” The old man was
won over by these words and gave vent to all his secret venom, for he
said that no benefit accrues to the recipients of Holy Baptism, and that
it is only by earnest prayer that the in-dwelling demon is driven out,
for that every one born into the world derives from his first father
slavery to the demons just as he does his nature; but that when these
are driven away, then come the Holy Ghost giving sensible and visible
signs of His presence, at once freeing the body from the impulse of the
passions and wholly ridding the soul of its inclination to the worse;
with the result that there is no more need for fasting that restrains
the body, nor of teaching or training that bridles it and instructs it
how to walk aright. And not only is the recipient of this gift liberated
from the wanton motions of the body, but also clearly foresees things to
come, and with the eyes beholds the Holy Trinity.

<span id="iv.viii.iv.x-p15"></span>In this wise the divine Flavianus dug
into the foul fountain-head and succeeded in laying bare its streams.
Then he thus addressed the wretched old man. “O thou that hast grown old
in evil days, thy own mouth convicts thee, not I, and thou art testified
against by thy own lips.” After their unsoundness had been thus exposed
they were expelled from Syria, and withdrew to Pamphylia, which they
filled with their pestilential doctrine.
