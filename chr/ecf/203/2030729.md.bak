induced me to make the translation so that it should be seen that I
acted, not in the spirit of contention and rivalry, in which he so often
acts, but from the necessity which I have explained above; and I did it
as an aid to a good and useful undertaking. <span

something both of lucidity and of brightness to one who, though with
little culture, was composing a serious work. Do we not know cases in
which old houses have been of use in the construction of new ones?
Sometimes a stone is taken from the parts of an old house which are
remote and concealed, to decorate the portal of the new house and adorn
its entrance. And at times an edifice of modern architecture is
supported by the strength of a single ancient beam. Are we then to place
ourselves in opposition to those who rightly use what is old in building
up what is new? Are we to say, You are not allowed to transfer the
materials of the old house to the new, unless you join each beam to its
beam, each stone to its stone, unless you make a portico of what was a
portico before, a chamber of what was a chamber; and this must further
involve building up the most secret recesses from what were such before,
and the sewers from the former sewers: for every large house must have
such places. This is the process of translating word for word, which in
former days you esteemed inadmissible, but which you now approve. But
you claim that what is in itself unlawful is lawful for you, while for
us even what is lawful you impute as a crime. You think it right that
you should be praised for changing the words of the Sacred Books and
Divine volumes; but if we, when we imitate you in translating a human
work, pass over anything which seems to us not to be edifying, we are to
have no pardon for this at your hands, though you yourself set us the
example.
