<span id="iv.viii.iv.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.iv.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI</span>.—*In what manner Valens
fell into heresy*.

<span id="iv.viii.iv.xi-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.iv.xi-p2.1"></span>I will</span> now pursue the course of my
narrative, and will describe the beginning of the tempest which stirred
up many and great billows to buffet the Church. Valens, when he first
received the imperial dignity, was distinguished by his fidelity to
apostolic doctrine. But when the Goths had crossed the Danube and were
ravaging Thrace, he determined to assemble an army and march against
them; and accordingly resolved not to take the field without the garb of
divine grace, but first to protect himself with the panoply of Holy
Baptism. <span id="fr_708"></span>[709](#fn_708.md) In forming this
resolution he acted at once well and wisely, but his subsequent conduct
betrays very great feebleness of character, resulting in the abandonment
of the truth. His fate was the same as that of our first father, Adam;
for he too, won over by the arguments of his wife, lost his free estate
and became not merely a captive but an obedient listener to woman’s wily
words. His wife <span id="fr_709"></span>[710](#fn_709.md) had already been
entrapped in the Arian snare, and now she caught her husband, and
persuaded him to fall along with her into the pit of blasphemy. Their
leader and initiator was Eudoxius, who still held the tiller of
Constantinople, with the result that the ship was not steered onwards
but sunk <span id="fr_710"></span>[711](#fn_710.md) to the bottom.

<span id="iv.viii.iv.xi-p5"></span> The use of the word *baptized* for
*submerged* is significant. Polyb. 1: 51. 6 uses it of sinking a ship.
It first appears with the technical sense of *baptized* in the
Evangelists.
