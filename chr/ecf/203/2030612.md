id="v.iv.xciii-p2.1"></span>\[Sidonius <span
id="fr_2737"></span>[2738](#fn_2737) </span> bishop of the Arverni wrote
several acceptable works and being a man sound in doctrine as well as
thoroughly imbued with divine and human learning and a man of commanding
genius wrote a considerable volume of *letters* to different persons
written in various metres or in prose and this showed his ability in
literature. Strong in Christian vigour even in the midst of that
barbaric ferocity which at that time oppressed the Gauls he was regarded
as a catholic father and a distinguished doctor. He flourished during
the tempest which marked the rule of Leo and Zenos.\] <span
