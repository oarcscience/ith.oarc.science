<span id="iv.viii.v.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.v.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VIII</span>.—*The council
assembled at Constantinople*.

<span id="iv.viii.v.viii-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.v.viii-p2.1"></span>At</span> this time the recent feeder of
the flock at Nazianzus <span id="fr_831"></span>[832](#fn_831.md) was
living at Constantino<span id="page_136">p. 136</span> <span
id="iv.viii.v.viii-Page_136"></span>ple, <span
id="fr_832"></span>[833](#fn_832.md) continually withstanding the
blasphemies of the Arians, watering the holy people with the teaching of
the Gospel, catching wanderers outside the flock and removing them from
poisonous pasture. So that flock once small he made a great one. When
the divine Meletius saw him, knowing as he did full well the object
which the makers of the canon <span id="fr_833"></span>[834](#fn_833.md)
had before them when, with the view of preventing the possibility of
ambitious efforts, they forbade the translation of bishops, he confirmed
Gregory in the episcopate of Constantinople. <span
id="fr_834"></span>[835](#fn_834.md) Shortly afterwards the divine Meletius
passed away to the life that knows no pain, crowned by the praises of
the funeral eloquence of all the great orators.

<span id="iv.viii.v.viii-p7"></span>Timotheus, bishop of Alexandria, who
had followed Peter, the successor of Athanasius in the patriarchate,
ordained in place of the admirable Gregorius, Maximus—a cynic who had
but recently suffered his cynic’s hair to be shorn, and had been carried
away by the flimsy rhetoric of Apollinarius. But this absurdity was
beyond the endurance of the assembled bishops—admirable men, and full of
divine zeal and wisdom, such as Helladius, successor of the great Basil,
Gregorius and Peter, brothers of Basil, and Amphilochius from Lycaonia,
Optimus from Pisidia, Diodorus from Cilicia. <span
id="fr_835"></span>[836](#fn_835.md)

<span id="iv.viii.v.viii-p10"></span>The council was also attended by
Pelagius of Laodicæa, <span id="fr_836"></span>[837](#fn_836.md) Eulogius
of Edessa, <span id="fr_837"></span>[838](#fn_837.md) Acacius, <span
id="fr_838"></span>[839](#fn_838.md) our own Isidorus, <span
id="fr_839"></span>[840](#fn_839.md) Cyril of Jerusalem, Gelasius of
Cæsarea in Palestine, <span id="fr_840"></span>[841](#fn_840.md) who was
renowned alike for lore and life and many other athletes of virtue.

<span id="iv.viii.v.viii-p16"></span>All these then whom I have named
separated themselves from the Egyptians and celebrated divine service
with the great Gregory. But he himself implored them, assembled as they
were to promote harmony, to subordinate all question of wrong to an
individual to the promotion of agreement with one another. “For,” said
he, “I shall be released from many cares and once more lead the quiet
life I hold so dear; while you, after your long and painful warfare,
will obtain the longed for peace. What can be more absurd than for men
who have just escaped the weapons of their enemies to waste their own
strength in wounding one another; by so doing we shall be a laughing
stock to our opponents. Find then some worthy man of sense, able to
sustain heavy responsibilities and discharge them well, and make him
bishop.” The excellent pastors moved by these counsels appointed as
bishop of that mighty city a man of noble birth and distinguished for
every kind of virtue as well as for the splendour of his ancestry, by
name Nectarius. Maximus, as having participated in the insanity of
Apollinarius, they stripped of his episcopal rank and rejected. They
next enacted canons concerning the good government of the church, and
published a confirmation of the faith set forth at Nicæa. Then they
returned each to his own country. Next summer the greater number of them
assembled again in the same city, summoned once more by the needs of the
church, and received a synodical letter from the bishops of the west
inviting them to come to Rome, where a great synod was being assembled.
They begged however to be excused from travelling thus far abroad; their
doing so, they said, would be useless. They wrote however both to point
out the storm which had risen against the churches, and to hint at the
carelessness with which the western bishops had treated it. They also
included in their letter a summary of the apostolic doctrine, but the
boldness and wisdom of their expressions will be more clearly shown by
the letter itself.

<span id="iv.viii.v.viii-p3"></span> “Cave credas episcopum Nazianzi his
verbis designari,” says Valesius;—because before 381 the great Gregory
of Nazianzus had at the most first helped his father in looking after
the church at Nazianzus, and on his father’s death taken temporary and
apparently informal charge of the see. But in the latter part of his
note Valesius suggests that <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.viii.v.viii-p3.1"></span>τὰ τελευταῖα</span> may refer to the
episcopate of Gregory at Nazianzus in his last days, after his
abdication of the see of Constantinople,—“Atque hic sensus magis placet,
magis enim convenire videtur verbis Theodoreti;” “Recent feeder,” then,
or “he who most recently fed,” will mean “he who after the events at
Constantinople which I am about to relate, acted as bishop of
Nazianzus.” Gregory left Constantinople in June 381, repaired to
Nazianzus, and after finding a suitable man to occupy the see, retired
to Arianzus, but was pressed to return and take a leading post in order
to check Apollinarian heretics. His health broke down, and he wished to
retire. He would have voted in the election of his successor, but his
opponents objected on the ground that he either was bishop of Nazianzus,
or not; if he was, there was no vacancy; if he was not, he had no vote.
Eulalius was chosen in 383, and Gregory spent six weary years in
wanderings and troubles, and at last found in rest in 389.

<span id="fn_832"></span>[136:833](2030148.htm#fr_832.md) <span
id="iv.viii.v.viii-p3.2"></span>

<span id="iv.viii.v.viii-p4"></span> It was probably in 379 that Gregory
first went to Constantinople and preached in a private house which was
to him a “Shiloh, where the ark rested, an Anastasia, a place of
resurrection” (Orat. 42. 6). Hence the name “Anastasia” given to the
famous church built on the site of the too strait house.

<span id="fn_833"></span>[136:834](2030148.htm#fr_833.md) <span
id="iv.viii.v.viii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="iv.viii.v.viii-p5"></span> i.e. the xvth of Nicæa, forbidding
any bishop, presbyter or deacon, to pass from one city to another.
Gregory himself classes it among “<span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.viii.v.viii-p5.1"></span>Νόμους πάλαι τεθνηκότας</span>” (Carm.
1810–11).

<span id="fn_834"></span>[136:835](2030148.htm#fr_834.md) <span
id="iv.viii.v.viii-p5.2"></span>

<span id="iv.viii.v.viii-p6"></span> Gregory had been practically acting
as bishop, when an intriguing party led by Peter of Alexandria tried to
force Maximus, a cynic professor, who was one of Gregory’s admiring
hearers, on the Constantinopolitan Church. “At this time,” i.e. probably
in the middle of 380, and certainly before Nov. 24, when Theodosius
entered the capital, “A priest from Thasco had come to Constantinople
with a large sum of money to buy Proconnesian marble for a church. He
too was beguiled by the specious hope held out to him. Maximus and his
party thus gained the power of purchasing the service of a mob, which
was as forward to attack Gregory as it had been to praise him. It was
night, and the bishop was ill in bed, when Maximus with his followers
went to the church to be consecrated by five suffragans who had been
sent from Alexandria for the purpose. Day began to dawn while they were
till preparing for the consecration. They had but half finished the
tonsure of the cynic philosopher, who wore the flowing hair common to
his sect, when a mob, excited by the sudden news, rushed in upon them,
and drove them from the church. They retired to a flute player’s shop to
complete their work, and Maximus, compelled to flee from Constantinople,
went to Thessalonica with the hope of gaining over Theodosius himself.”

<span id="iv.viii.v.viii-p8"></span> Helladius, successor of Basil at
the Cappadocian Cæsarea, was orthodox, but on important occasions
clashed unhappily with each of the two great Gregories of Nyssa and
Nazianzus.
