<span id="vi.xii.i.xxvii-p1"></span> 26. The fifth passage selected by
him for blame is the most important, that in which I explain the
statement of the Apostle. <span id="fr_3051"></span>[3052](#fn_3051.md)
“From whom all the body fitly framed and knit together through every
juncture of ministration, according to the working in due measure of
every several part, maketh the increase of the body unto the building up
of itself in love.” Here I summed up in a short sentence Origen’s
exposition which is very long and goes over the same ideas in various
words, yet so as to leave out none of his illustrations or his
assertions. And when I had come to the end, I added:

<span id="vi.xii.i.xxvii-p3"></span>“And so in the restitution of all
things, when Jesus Christ the true physician comes to restore to health
the whole body of the Church, which now lies scattered and rent, every
one will receive his proper place according to the measure of his faith
and his recognition of the Son of God (the word ‘recognize’ implies that
he had formerly known him and afterwards had ceased to know him), and
shall then begin to be what he once had been; yet not in such a way as
that, as held by another heresy, all should be placed in one rank, and,
by a renovating process, all become angels; but that each member,
according to its own measure and office shall become perfect: for
instance, that the apostate angel shall begin to be that which he was by
his creation, and that man who had been cast out of paradise shall be
restored again to the cultivation of paradise;” and so on.
