<span id="iv.x.cix"></span>

<span id="iv.x.cix-p1"></span> *CIX. To Eusebius, Bishop of
Ancyra.* <span id="fr_1844"></span>[1845](#fn_1844)

<span id="iv.x.cix-p3"></span>Many are the devices secretly plotted
against me, and through me patched up against the faith of apostles. I
am however comforted by the sufferings of the Saints, Prophets,
Apostles, Martyrs, and men famous in the churches in the word of Grace;
and besides these by the promises of our God and Saviour, for in this
present life He has promised us nothing pleasant or delightful, but
rather trouble, toil, and peril, and attacks of enemies. “In the world,”
He says, “ye shall have tribulation,” <span
id="fr_1845"></span>[1846](#fn_1845) and “if they have persecuted me
they will also persecute you,” <span
id="fr_1846"></span>[1847](#fn_1846) and “If they have called the master
of the house Beelzebub how much more shall they call them of his
household,” <span id="fr_1847"></span>[1848](#fn_1847) and “The time
cometh when whosoever killeth you will think he doeth God
service,” <span id="fr_1848"></span>[1849](#fn_1848) and “Straight is
the gate and narrow the way which leadeth unto life,” <span
id="fr_1849"></span>[1850](#fn_1849) and “When they persecute you in
this city flee you into another,” <span
id="fr_1850"></span>[1851](#fn_1850) and I might quote all similar
passages. The divine Apostle too speaks in the same strain. “Yea and all
that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution, but evil
men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving and being
deceived.” <span id="fr_1851"></span>[1852](#fn_1851) These words give
me the greatest comfort in this distress. As the calumnies uttered
against me have probably reached your holiness’s ears, I beseech your
holiness to give no credence to the lies of my slanderers. I am not
aware of ever having taught anyone up to the present time to believe in
two sons. I have been taught to believe in one only begotten, our Lord
Jesus Christ, God the Word made man. But I know the distinction between
flesh and Godhead, and regard as impious all who divide our one Lord
Jesus Christ into two sons, as well as those who, travelling in an
opposite direction, call the Godhead and manhood of the master Christ
one nature. For these exaggerations stand opposed to one another, while
between them lies the way of the doctrines of the Gospel, beautified by
the footprints of prophets and apostles, and of all who after them have
been conspicuous for the gift of teaching. I was anxious to adduce their
opinions, and to point out how they bear witness in favour of my own,
but I want more words than a letter allows room for, wherefore I have
written summarily what I have been taught about the incarnation of the
only begotten; I send my statement to your godly excellency. <span
id="fr_1852"></span>[1853](#fn_1852) I have written not with the object
of teaching others, but of making my defence against the accusations
brought against me, and of explaining my sentiments to those who are
ignorant of them. After your holiness has read what I have written, if
you find it in conformity with the apostolic doctrines, I hope you will
confirm my opinion by what you reply—if, on the contrary, anything that
I have said jars with the divine teaching, I request to be told of it by
your holiness. For, though I have spent much time in teaching, I still
need one to teach me. “We know,” says the divine Apostle “in
part,” <span id="fr_1853"></span>[1854](#fn_1853) and again he says, “If
any man think that he knoweth anything he knoweth nothing yet as he
ought to know.” <span id="fr_1854"></span>[1855](#fn_1854) So I hope
that I may hear the truth from your holiness, and that you may also give
heed to the calm of the Church, and fight for the divine doctrines. It
is for their sakes that the very godly bishops, making light of the
difficulties of the journey, and of the winter, have set out for the
imperial city, in the <span id="page_290">p. 290</span> <span
id="iv.x.cix-Page_290"></span>endeavour to bring about some end to the
storm. Send them I pray you, on their way with your prayers and with
your prayers too strengthen me. <span

<span id="iv.x.cix-p14"></span> The route of the bishops would be by
land, in consequence of the dangers of the sea voyage in winter time.
From Ancyra (Angora) they would follow the course of the Sangarius into
Bithynia, and would cross thence via Chalcedon to Constantinople.
