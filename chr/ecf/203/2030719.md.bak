<span id="vi.xi.iii.xxxv-p1"></span> 30. It seems needless to make any
answer to that part of his indictment in which he says that the works of
the Martyr Pamphilus, expressed as they are with so much faithful<span
id="page_474">p. 474</span> <span
id="vi.xi.iii.xxxv-Page_474"></span>ness and piety, are either not to be
considered genuine or if genuine, to be treated with contempt. Is there
any one to whose authority he will bow? Is there any one whom he will
refrain from abusing? All the old Greek writers of the church, according
to him, have erred. As to the Latins, how he disparages them, how he
attacks them one by one, both those of the old and those of modern
times, any one who reads his various work knows well. Now even the
Martyrs fail to gain any respect from him. “I do not believe,” he says
“that this is really the work of the Martyr.” If such an argument were
admitted in the case of the works of any writer, how can we prove their
genuineness in any particular case? If I were to say, It is not true
that books of Miscellanies are Origen’s as you maintain, how can they be
proved to be his? His answer is, From their likeness to the rest. But,
just as, when a man wants to forge some one’s signature, he imitates his
handwriting, so he who wishes to introduce his own thoughts under
another man’s name, is sure to imitate the style of him whose name he
has assumed. But, to pass over for brevity’s sake all that might with
great justice be said on this point, if you were determined to be so
bold as to question the works of the Martyr, you ought to have brought
out publicly the actual statements which seemed to you liable to
question, and then every reader could have seen what was absurd in them
and what was reasonable, what was unsuitable to or against the system of
the Apostles; and especially the great impiety, whatever it may have
been, in expiation of which you tell us that the Martyr shed his blood.
A man who read those actual words would be able to say, not, as now, on
your judgment but on his own, either that the martyr had gone wrong, or
that a treatise which was so full of absurdity and unbelief had been
composed by some one else. But, as it is, you know well that if the
writings which you impugn are read by any one, the blame will be turned
back upon him who has unjustly found fault; and therefore you do not
cite the passages which you impugn, but with that ‘censor’s rod’ of
yours, and by your own arrogant authority, you make your decrees in this
style: “Let this book be cast out of the libraries, let that book be
retained; and again, if today a book is accepted, tomorrow if any one
but myself has praised it, let it be cast out, and with it the man who
praised it. Let this one be counted as Catholic, even though he seems at
times to have gone wrong; let that man have no pardon for his error,
even though he has said the same things as myself, and let no man
translate him nor read him, for fear he should recognize my plagiarisms.
This man indeed was a heretic, but he was my master. And this other,
though he is a Jew, and of the Synagogue of Satan, and is hired to sell
words for gain, yet he is my master who must be preferred to all others,
because it is among the Jews alone that the truth of the Scriptures
dwells.” If the universal Church had with one voice conferred on you
this authority, and had demanded of you that you should be the judge of
each and all, would it not have been your duty to refuse to allow so
heavy and perilous a burden to be laid upon you? But now we have made
such progress in the daily habit of disparaging others that we no longer
spare even the martyrs. But let us suppose that the work is not that of
the martyr Pamphilus, but of some other unknown member of the church;
did he, whoever he may have been, employ his own words, I ask, so that
we are called upon to defer to the merits of the writer? No. He sets out
quotations from the works of Origen himself, and exhibits his opinion
upon each question not in the words of the apologist but in those of the
accused himself; and, just as in the present treatise what I have quoted
from your writings carried much more force than what I have said myself,
so also the defence of Origen lies not in the authority of his
apologist, but in his own words. The question of authorship is
superfluous, when the defence is so conducted as to dispense with the
author’s aid.
