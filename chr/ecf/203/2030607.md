those who say that Christ while living in this world did not see the
Father with his eyes of flesh—But after his resurrection from the dead
and his ascension into heaven when he had been translated into the glory
of God the Father as in reward so to speak to him for his abnegation and
a compensation for his martyrdom. In this work he showed both from his
own argument and from the testimony of Sacred Scriptures that the Lord
Jesus from his conception by the Holy Spirit and his birth of the Virgin
through which true God in true man himself also man made God was born,
always beheld with his eyes of flesh both the Father and the Holy Spirit
through the special and complete union of God and man.
