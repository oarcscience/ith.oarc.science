<span id="iv.viii.ii.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.ii.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II</span>.—*Declension of the
Emperor Constantius from the true Faith*.

<span id="iv.viii.ii.ii-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.ii.ii-p2.1"></span>Constantia</span>, the widow of Licinius,
was the half-sister of Constantine <span
id="fr_450"></span>[451](#fn_450.md) . She was intimately acquainted with a
certain priest who had imbibed the doctrines of Arius. He did not openly
acknowledge his unsoundness; but, in the frequent conversations which he
had with her, he did not refrain from declaring that Arius had been
unjustly calumniated. After the death of her impious husband, the
renowned Constantine did everything in his power to solace her, and
strove to prevent her from experiencing the saddest trials of widowhood.
He attended her also in her last illness <span
id="fr_451"></span>[452](#fn_451.md) , and rendered her every proper
attention. She then presented the priest whom I mentioned to the
emperor, and entreated him to receive <span id="page_66">p. 66</span>
<span id="iv.viii.ii.ii-Page_66"></span>him under his protection.
Constantine acceded to her request, and soon after fulfilled his
promise. But though the priest was permitted the utmost freedom of
speech, and was most honourably treated, he did not venture to reveal
his corrupt principles, for he observed the firmness with which the
emperor adhered to the truth. When Constantine was on the point of being
translated to an eternal kingdom, he drew up a will, in which he
directed that his temporal dominions should be divided among his sons.
None of them was with him when he was dying, so he entrusted the will to
this priest alone, and desired him to give it to Constantius, who, being
at a shorter distance from the spot than his brothers, was expected to
arrive the first. These directions the priest executed, and thus by
putting the will into his hands, became known to Constantius, who
accepted him as an intimate friend, and commanded him to visit him
frequently. Perceiving the weakness of Constantius, whose mind was like
reeds driven to and fro by the wind, he became emboldened to declare war
against the doctrines of the gospel. He loudly deplored the stormy state
of the churches, and asserted it to be due to those who had introduced
the unscriptural word “consubstantial” into the confession of faith, and
that all the disputes among the clergy and the laity had been occasioned
by it. He calumniated Athanasius and all who coincided in his opinions,
and formed designs for their destruction, being used as their
fellow-worker by Eusebius <span id="fr_452"></span>[453](#fn_452.md) ,
Theognis, and Theodorus, bishop of Perinthus.

<span id="iv.viii.ii.ii-p6"></span>The last-named, whose see is
generally known by the name of Heraclea, was a man of great erudition,
and had written an exposition of the Holy Scriptures <span
id="fr_453"></span>[454](#fn_453.md) .

<span id="iv.viii.ii.ii-p8"></span>These bishops resided near the
emperor, and frequently visited him; they assured him that the return of
Athanasius from banishment had occasioned many evils, and had excited a
tempest which had shaken not only Egypt, but also Palestine, Phœnicia,
and the adjacent countries <span id="fr_454"></span>[455](#fn_454.md) .

<span id="iv.viii.ii.ii-p3"></span> Vide Pedigree. Philostorgius (ii.
16) said the will was given to Eusebius of Nicomedia. Valesius (on Soc.
i. 25) thinks that if the story had been true Athanasius would have
recorded it, with the name of the Presbyter.

<span id="iv.viii.ii.ii-p9"></span> The ground of objection to the
return was (i) that Athanasius had been condemned by a Council—that of
Tyre, and (ii) that he was restored by the authority of the state alone.
The first intention was to get the Arian Pistus advanced to the
patriarchate.
