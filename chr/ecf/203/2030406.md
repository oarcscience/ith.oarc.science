of philosopher, a citizen of Neapolis, a city of Palestine, and the son
of Priscus Bacchius, laboured strenuously in behalf of the religion of
Christ, insomuch that he delivered to Antoninus Pius and his sons and
the senate, a work written *Against the nations,* and did not shun the
ignominy of the cross. He addressed another book also to the successors
of this Antoninus, Marcus Antoninus Verus and Lucius Aurelius Commodus.
Another volume of his *Against the nations,* is also extant, where he
discusses the nature of demons, and a fourth against the nations which
he entitled, *Refutation* and yet another *On the sovereignty of God,*
and another book which he entitled, *Psaltes,* and another *On the
Soul,* the *Dialogue against the Jews,* which he held against Trypho,
the leader of the Jews, and also notable volumes *Against Marcion,*
which Irenæus also mentions in the fourth book <span

book *Against all heresies* which he mentions in the *Apology* which is
addressed to Antoninus Pius. He, when he had held <span

city of Rome, and had convicted Crescens the cynic, who said many
blasphemous things against the Christians, of gluttony and fear of
death, and had proved him devoted to luxury and lusts, at last, accused
of being a Christian, through the efforts and wiles of Crescens, he shed
his blood for Christ.
