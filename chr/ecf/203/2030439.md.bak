id="v.iii.lviii-p2.1"></span>Ambrosius</span>, <span
id="fr_2465"></span>[2466](#fn_2465.md) at first a Marcionite but
afterwards set right by Origen, was deacon in the church, and gloriously
distinguished as confessor of the Lord. To him, together with
Protoctetus the presbyter, the book of Origen, *On martyrdom* was
written. Aided <span id="fr_2466"></span>[2467](#fn_2466.md) by his
industry, funds, and perseverance, Origen dictated a great number of
volumes. He himself, as befits a man of noble nature, was of no mean
literary talent, as his letters to Origen indicate. He died moreover,
before the death of Origen, and is condemned by many, in that being a
man of wealth, he did not at death, remember in his will, his old and
needy friend.
