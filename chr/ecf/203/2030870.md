<span id="vi.xiii.xxii-p1"></span> 21. But, says some one, “Are these
things to be understood of the Lord? Could the Lord be held prisoner by
men and dragged to judgment?” Of this also the same Prophet shall
convince you. For he says, “The Lord Himself shall come into judgment
with the elders and princes of the people.” <span
id="fr_3311"></span>[3312](#fn_3311) The Lord is judged then according
to the Prophet’s testimony, and not only judged, but scourged, and
smitten on the face with the palms (of men’s hands), and spitted on, and
suffers every insult and indignity for our sake. And because all who
should hear these things preached by the Apostles would be perfectly
amazed, therefore also the Prophet speaking in their person exclaims,
“Lord, who hath believed our report?” <span
id="fr_3312"></span>[3313](#fn_3312) For it is incredible that God, the
Son of God, should be spoken of and preached as having suffered these
things. For this reason they are foretold by the Prophets, lest any
doubt should spring up in those who are about to believe. Christ the
Lord Himself therefore in His own person, <span id="page_552">p.
552</span> <span id="vi.xiii.xxii-Page_552"></span>says, “I gave My back
to the scourges, and My cheeks to the palms, <span
id="fr_3313"></span>[3314](#fn_3313) I turned not away My face from
shame and spitting.” <span id="fr_3314"></span>[3315](#fn_3314) This
also is written among His other sufferings, that they bound Him, and led
Him away to Pilate. This also the Prophet foretold, saying, “And they
bound him and conducted Him as a pledge of friendship *(xenium)* to King
Jarim.” <span id="fr_3315"></span>[3316](#fn_3315) But some one objects,
“But Pilate was not a king.” Hear then what the Gospel relates next,
“Pilate hearing that He was from Galilee, sent Him to Herod, who was
king in Israel at that time.” <span id="fr_3316"></span>[3317](#fn_3316)
And rightly does the Prophet add the name “Jarim,” which means “a
wild-vine, for Herod was not of the house of Israel, nor of that
Israelitish vine which the Lord had brought out of Egypt, and “planted
in a very fruitful hill,” <span id="fr_3317"></span>[3318](#fn_3317) but
was a wild vine, i.e. of an alien stock. Rightly, therefore, was he
called “a wild-vine,” because he in nowise sprung from the shoots of the
vine of Israel. And whereas the Prophet used the phrase “*xenium,*” “A
pledge of friendship,” this also corresponds, “For Herod and Pilate,” as
the Gospel witnesses, “from being enemies were made friends,” <span
id="fr_3318"></span>[3319](#fn_3318) and, as though in token of their
reconciliation, each sent Jesus bound to the other. What matter, so long
as Jesus, as Saviour, reconciles those who were at variance, and
restores peace, and also brings back concord! Wherefore of this also it
is written in Job, “May the Lord reconcile the hearts of the princes of
the earth.” <span id="fr_3319"></span>[3320](#fn_3319)
