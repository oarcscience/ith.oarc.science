id="fr_2534"></span>[2535](#fn_2534.md) bishop of Barcelona, in the
Pyrenees Mountains, a man of chaste eloquence, and as distinguished by
his life as by his speech, wrote various short works, among which are
*The Deer*, <span id="fr_2535"></span>[2536](#fn_2535.md) and *Against the
Novatians,* and died in the reign of Emperor Theodosian, in extreme old
age.

<span id="v.iii.cviii-p4"></span> *Deer,*This title has given rise to a
good deal of conjecture. Fabricius’s conjecture that it referred to
certain games held on the Kalends of January is doubted by Vallarsi, but
appears to have been really acute, from the fact that two <span
class="c14"><span id="v.iii.cviii-p4.1"></span>mss.</span> read “The
deer \[Cervulus\] on the Kalends of January and against other pagan
games.”
