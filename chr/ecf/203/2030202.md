<span id="iv.x.xiii-p1"></span> *XIII. To Cyrus.*

<span id="iv.x.xiii-p2"></span>I had heard of the island of Lesbos, and
its cities Mitylene, Methymna, and the rest; but I was ignorant of the
fruit of the vine cultivated in it. <span
id="fr_1627"></span>[1628](#fn_1627.md) Now, thanks to your diligence, I
have become acquainted with it, and I admire both its whiteness and the
delicacy of its flavour. Perhaps time may even improve it, unless it
turns it sour; for wine, like the body, and plants, and buildings, and
other things made by hand, is damaged by time. If, as you say, it makes
the drinker longlived, I am afraid it will be of little use to me, for I
have no desire to live a long life, when life’s storms are so many and
so hard.

<span id="iv.x.xiii-p4"></span>I was however much pleased to hear of the
health of the monk. Really my anxiety about him was quite distressing,
and I wrongly blamed the doctors, for his complaint required the
treatment they gave. I have sent you a little pot of honey which the
Cilician bees make from storax flowers.

Aristotle, when asked to nominate his successor, and wishing to point
out the superiority of Theophrastus to Menedemus, called first for a cup
of Rhodian, and then of Lesbian, and after sipping both, exclaimed <span
