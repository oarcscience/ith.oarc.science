<span id="vi.xi.iii.x-p1"></span> 9. When he wrote his treatises against
Jovinian, and some one had raised objections to them, he was informed of
these objections by Domnio, that old man whose memory we all revere; and
in his answer to him <span id="fr_2948"></span>[2949](#fn_2948.md) he said
that it was impossible that a man like him should be in the wrong, since
his knowledge extended to everything that could be known: and he
proceeded to enumerate the various kinds of syllogisms, and the whole
art of learning and of writing (of course supposing that the man who
found fault with him knew nothing about such things). He then goes on
thus: <span id="fr_2949"></span>[2950](#fn_2949.md)

<span id="vi.xi.iii.x-p4"></span>“It was foolish, it appears, in me to
think that I could not know all these things without the philosophers,
and to look upon the end of the stylus which strikes out and corrects as
better than the end with which we write. It was useless for me it seems,
to have translated <span id="fr_2950"></span>[2951](#fn_2950.md) the
Commentaries of Alexander, and for my learned master to have brought me
into the knowledge of Logic through the ‘Introduction’ of Porphyry; and,
putting aside humanistic teachers, there was no reason why I should have
had Gregory Nazianzen and Didymus as my teachers in the Scriptures.”

<span id="vi.xi.iii.x-p6"></span>This, you observe, is the man who said
to Christ, I have denied thee if ever I am found to possess or to read
the works of the heathen. He might, one would think, at all events have
left out Porphyry, who was Christ’s special enemy, who endeavoured as
far as in him lay to completely subvert the Christian religion, but whom
he now glories in having had as his instructor in his Introduction to
Logic. He cannot put in the plea that he had learned these things at a
former time: for, before his conversion, he and I equally were wholly
ignorant of the Greek language and literature. All these things came
after his oath, after that solemn engagement had been made. It is of no
use for us to argue in such a case. It will at once be said to us: Man,
you are wrong, God is not mocked, and no syllogisms spun out of the
books of Alexander will avail with him. I think, my brother, it was an
ill-omened event that you submitted to the Introduction of Porphyry.
Into what has that faithless man introduced you? If it is into the place
where he is now, that is the place where there is weeping and gnashing
of teeth; for there dwell the apostate and the enemies of God; and
perhaps the perjurers will go there too.
