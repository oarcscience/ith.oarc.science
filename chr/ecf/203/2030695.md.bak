<span id="vi.xi.iii.xi-p1"></span> 10. You chose a bad introducer. If
you will take my counsel, both you and I will by preference turn to him
who introduces us to the Father and who said <span
id="fr_2951"></span>[2952](#fn_2951.md) ‘No man cometh unto the Father but
by me.’ I lament for you, my brother, if you believe this; and if you
believe it not, I still lament that you hunt through all sorts of
ancient and antiquated documents for grounds for suspecting other men of
perjury, while perjury, lasting and endless with all its inexplicable
impiety, remains upon your own lips. Might not these words of the
Apostle be rightly applied to you: <span
id="fr_2952"></span>[2953](#fn_2952.md) “Thou that art called a Jew and
restest in the law, and makest thy boast in God, being instructed out of
the law, and trustest that thou thyself art a leader of the blind, a
light of them that sit in darkness, an instructor of the foolish, a
teacher of babes, who hast a form of knowledge and of the truth in the
law: Thou therefore, that teachest others, teachest thou not thyself?
Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit
adultery? Thou that preachest that a man should not steal, dost thou
steal? Thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege”—that is
perjury? And, what comes last and most important, “The name of God is
blasphemed among the Gentiles through you,” and your love of strife.
