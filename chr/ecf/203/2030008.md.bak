<span id="iv.iv.ii"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iv.iv.ii-p1.1"></span>II.—Episcopate at Cyrus.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.ii-p2"></span>Cyrus or Cyrrhus was a town of the
district of Syria called after it Cyrestica. The capital of Cyrestica
was Gindarus, which Strabo describes <span
id="fr_26"></span>[27](#fn_26.md) as being in his time a natural nest of
robbers. Cyrus lies on a branch of the river Œnoparas, now Aphreen, and
the site is still known as Koros. A tradition has long obtained that it
received the name of Cyrus from the Jews in honour of their great
benefactor, but this is more than doubtful. The form Cyrus may have
arisen from a confusion with a Cyrus in Susiana. <span
id="fr_27"></span>[28](#fn_27.md) The Cyrestica is a fertile plain lying
between the spurs of the Alma Dagh and the Euphrates, irrigated by three
streams and blessed with a rich soil. The diocese, which was subject to
the Metropolitan of Hierapolis, contained some sixteen hundred square
miles <span id="fr_28"></span>[29](#fn_28.md) and eight hundred distinct
parishes each with its church. <span id="fr_29"></span>[30](#fn_29.md) But
Cyrus itself was a wretched little place <span
id="fr_30"></span>[31](#fn_30.md) scantily inhabited. Before it was
beautified by the munificence of Theodoret it contained no buildings of
any dignity or grace. The people of the town as well as of the diocese
seem to have been poor in orthodoxy as well as in pocket, and the rich
soil of the district grew a plentiful crop of the tares of Arianism,
Marcionism, Eunomianism and Judaism. <span
id="fr_31"></span>[32](#fn_31.md)

<span id="iv.iv.ii-p9"></span>Such was the diocese to which Theodoret,
in spite of his honest *nolo episcopari,* <span
id="fr_32"></span>[33](#fn_32.md) was consecrated at about the age of
thirty, <span class="c14"><span id="iv.iv.ii-p10.1"></span>a.d.</span>
423. Of the circumstances of this consecration we have no evidence.
Garnerius conjectures that he must have been ordained deacon by
Alexander who succeeded Porphyrius at Antioch. He was probably
appointed, if not consecrated, to succeed Isidorus at Cyrus, by
Theodotus the successor of Alexander on the patriarchal throne of
Antioch. In this diocese certainly for five and twenty years, perhaps
for five and thirty, with occasional intervals he worked night and day
with unflagging patience and perseverance for the good of the people
committed to his care, and in the cause of his Master and of the truth.
The ecclesiastic of these early <span id="page_4">p. 4</span> <span
id="iv.iv.ii-Page_4"></span>times is sometimes imagined to have been a
morose and ungenial ascetic, wasting his energies in unprofitable
hair-splitting, and taking little or no interest in the every day needs
of his contemporaries. In marked contrast with this imaginary bishop
stands out the kindly figure of the real bishop of Cyrus, as the modest
statements and hints supplied by his own letters enable us to recall
him.

<span id="iv.iv.ii-p11"></span>As an administrator and man of business
he was munificent and efficient. Stripped, as we have already learnt, of
his family property by his own act and will, he must have been dependent
in his diocese on the revenues of his see. From these, which cannot have
been small, he was able to spend large sums on public works. Cyrus was
adorned with porticoes, with two great bridges, with baths, and with an
aqueduct, all at Theodoret’s expense. <span
id="fr_33"></span>[34](#fn_33.md) On assuming the administration of his
diocese he took measures, he tells us, <span
id="fr_34"></span>[35](#fn_34.md) to secure for Cyrus “the necessary arts,”
and from these three words we need not hesitate to infer that
architects, engineers, masons, sculptors, and carpenters, would be
attracted “from all quarters” to the bishop’s important works. And for
this increased population it is interesting to note that Theodoret
provided competent practitioners in medicine and surgery, in which it
would seem he was not himself unskilled. <span
id="fr_35"></span>[36](#fn_35.md) His keen interest in the temporal needs
of his people is shown by the efforts he made to obtain relief for them
from the cruel pressure of exorbitant taxation. <span
id="fr_36"></span>[37](#fn_36.md) So unendurable was the tale of imposts
under which they groaned that in many cases they were deserting their
farms and the country, and he earnestly appeals to the empress Pulcheria
and to his friend Anatolius to help them. <span
id="fr_37"></span>[38](#fn_37.md) The tender sympathy felt by him for all
those afflicted in body and estate, as well as in mind, is shown in his
letters on behalf of Celestinianus, or Celestiacus, a gentleman of
position at Carthage, who had suffered cruelly during the attack of the
Vandals, <span id="fr_38"></span>[39](#fn_38.md) and in the admirable and
touching letters of consolation addressed to survivors on the deaths of
relatives. That these should have been religiously preserved need excite
no surprise. <span id="fr_39"></span>[40](#fn_39.md) Of the terms on which
he lived with his neighbours we can form some idea from the justifiable
boast contained in his letter to Nomus. In the quarter of a century of
his episcopate, he writes, he never appeared in court either as
prosecutor or defendant; his clergy followed his admirable example; he
never took an obol or a garment from any one; not one of his household
ever received so much as a loaf or an egg; he could not bear to think
that he had any property beyond his few poor clothes. <span
id="fr_40"></span>[41](#fn_40.md) Yet he was always ready to give where he
would not receive, and in addition to all the diocesan and literary work
which he conscientiously performed, he spent more time than he could
well afford in all sorts of extra diocesan business which his position
thrust in his way.

<span id="iv.iv.ii-p20"></span>As a shepherd of souls he was unceasing
in his efforts to win heathen, heretics and Jews to the true faith. His
diocese, when he assumed its government, was a very hotbed of
heresy. <span id="fr_41"></span>[42](#fn_41.md) Nevertheless in the famous
letter to Leo <span id="fr_42"></span>[43](#fn_42.md) he could boast that
not a tare was left to spoil the crop. His fame as a preacher was great
and wide, and makes us the more regret that of the discourses which in
turn roused, cheered, and blamed, so little should survive. The
eloquence, so to say, of his extant writings, gives indications of the
force of spoken utterances not less marked by learning and literary
skill. Two of his letters give vivid pictures of the enthusiasm of
oriental auditories in Antioch, once so populous and so keen in
theological interest, where now, amid a people numbering only about a
fiftieth part of their predecessors of the fifth century, there is not a
single church. We see the patriarch John in a frenzy of gladness at
Theodoret’s sermons, clapping his hands and springing again and again
from his chair; <span id="fr_43"></span>[44](#fn_43.md) we see the heads of
the congregation receiving the bishop of Cyrus with frantic delight as
he came down from the pulpit, flinging their arms round him, kissing now
his head, now his breast, now his hands, now his knees, and hear them
exclaiming, “This is the Voice of the Apostle!” <span
id="fr_44"></span>[45](#fn_44.md) But Theodoret had to encounter sometimes
the fury of opposition. Again and again in his campaign against heretics
and unbelievers he was stoned, wounded, and brought nigh unto
death. <span id="fr_45"></span>[46](#fn_45.md) “He from whom no secrets are
hid knows all the bruises my body has received, aimed at me by ill-named
heretics, and what fights I have fought in most of the cities of the
East against Jews, heretics, and heathen.” <span
id="fr_46"></span>[47](#fn_46.md)
