id="v.iv.lxxxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter LXXXVI.</span>

<span id="v.iv.lxxxvii-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="v.iv.lxxxvii-p2.1"></span>Faustus, <span
id="fr_2723"></span>[2724](#fn_2723.md) </span> first abbot of the
monastery at Lerins, and then made bishop <span
id="fr_2724"></span>[2725](#fn_2724.md) of Riez in Gaul, a man studious of
the Divine Scriptures, taking his text from the historic creed of the
church, composed a book *On the Holy Spirit,* in which he shows from the
belief of the fathers, that the Holy Spirit is consubstantial and
coeternal with the Father and the Son, the fulness of the Trinity and
therefore God. <span id="fr_2725"></span>[2726](#fn_2725.md) He published
also an excellent work, *On the grace of God, through which we are
saved,* <span id="fr_2726"></span>[2727](#fn_2726.md) in which he teaches
that the grace of God always invites, pre<span id="page_400">p.
400</span> <span id="v.iv.lxxxvii-Page_400"></span>cedes and helps our
will, and whatever gain that freedom of will may attain for its pious
effect, is not its own desert, but the gift of grace. I have read also a
little book of his *Against the Arians and Macedonians,* in which he
posits a coëssential Trinity, and another against those who say that
there is anything incorporeal in created things, in which he maintains
from the testimony of Scriptures, and by quotations from the fathers,
that nothing is to be regarded as incorporeal but God. There is also a
letter of his, written in the form of a little book, and addressed to a
certain deacon, named Graecus, who, leaving the Catholic faith, had gone
over to the Nestorian impiety.

<span id="v.iv.lxxxvii-p7"></span>In this epistle he admonishes him to
believe that the holy Virgin Mary did not bring forth a mere human
being, who afterwards should receive divinity, but true God in true man.
There are still other works by him, but as I have not read, I do not
care to mention them. This excellent doctor is enthusiastically believed
in and admired. He wrote afterwards also to Felix, the Prætonian
prefect, and a man of Patrician rank, son of Magnus the consul, a very
pious letter, exhorting to the fear of God, a work well fitted to induce
one to repent with his whole heart.
