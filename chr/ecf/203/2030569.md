<span id="v.iv.l-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="v.iv.l-p2.1"></span>Paulinus, <span
id="fr_2654"></span>[2655](#fn_2654.md) </span> bishop of Nola in Campania,
composed many brief works in verse, also a consolatory work to Celsus
*On the death of a christian and baptized child,* a sort of epitaph,
well fortified with christian hope, also many *Letters to Severus,* and
*A panegric* in prose written before he became bishop, *On victory over
tyrants* which was addressed to Theodosius and maintained that victory
lay rather in faith and prayer, than in arms. He wrote also a
*Sacramentary* and *Hymnal.*

<span id="v.iv.l-p4"></span>He also addressed many letters to his
sister, *On contempt of the world,* and published treatises of different
sorts, on various occasions. <span id="fr_2655"></span>[2656](#fn_2655.md)

<span id="v.iv.l-p6"></span>The most notable of all his minor works are
the works *On repentance,* and *A general panegyric of all the martyrs.*
He lived in the reign of Honorius and Valentinianus, and was
distinguished, not only for erudition <span
id="fr_2656"></span>[2657](#fn_2656.md) and holiness of life, but also for
his ability to cast out demons.
