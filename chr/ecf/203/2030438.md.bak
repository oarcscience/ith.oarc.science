philosophical learning, was distinguished at Alexandria, at the same

elaborate work which he composed *On the harmony of Moses and Jesus,*
and the *Gospel canons,* which he worked out, and which Eusebius of

become a heathen again, after being a Christian, but it is certain that
he continued a Christian until the very end of his life.
