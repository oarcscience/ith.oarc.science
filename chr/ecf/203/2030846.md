<span id="vi.xii.iii.xliv"></span>

<span id="vi.xii.iii.xliv-p1"></span> 43. If you wish me to keep
silence, cease from accusing me. Lay down your sword, and I will throw
away my shield. To one thing only I cannot consent; that is, to spare
the heretics, and not to vindicate my orthodoxy. If that is the cause of
discord between us, I can submit to death, but not to silence. It would
have been right to go through the whole of the Scriptures for answers to
your ravings, and, like David playing on his harp, to take the divine
words to calm your raging breast. But I will content myself with a few
statements from a single book; I will oppose Wisdom to folly; for I hope
if you despise the words of men you will not think lightly of the word
of God. Listen, then, to that which Solomon the wise says about you and
all who are addicted to evil speaking and contumely:

<span id="vi.xii.iii.xliv-p2"></span>“Foolish men, while they desire
injuries, become impious and hate wisdom. <span
id="fr_3211"></span>[3212](#fn_3211) Devise not evil against thy friend.
Be not angry with a man without a cause. The impious exalt contumely.
 <span id="fr_3212"></span>[3213](#fn_3212) Remove from thee the evil
mouth, keep far from thee the wicked lips, the eyes of him that speaketh
evil, the tongue of the unjust, the hands which shed the blood of the
just, <span id="fr_3213"></span>[3214](#fn_3213) the heart that deviseth
evil thoughts, and the feet which hasten to do evil. He that resteth
upon falsehood feedeth the winds, and followeth the flying birds. For he
hath left the ways of his own vineyard, and hath made the wheels of his
tillage to err. He walketh through the dry and desert places, and with
his hands he gathereth barrenness. <span
id="fr_3214"></span>[3215](#fn_3214) The mouth of the froward is near to
destruction, and  <span id="fr_3215"></span>[3216](#fn_3215) he who
uttereth evil words is the chief of fools. Every simple man is a soul
that is blessed; but a violent man is dishonourable.  <span
id="fr_3216"></span>[3217](#fn_3216) By the fault of his lips the sinner
falleth into a snare.  <span id="fr_3217"></span>[3218](#fn_3217) All
the ways of a fool are right in his own eyes.  <span
id="fr_3218"></span>[3219](#fn_3218) The fool showeth his anger on that
very day.  <span id="fr_3219"></span>[3220](#fn_3219) Lying lips are an
abomination to the Lord.  <span id="fr_3220"></span>[3221](#fn_3220) He
that keepeth his lips guardeth his own soul; but he that is rash with
his lips shall be a terror to himself.  <span
id="fr_3221"></span>[3222](#fn_3221) The evil man in his violence doeth
evil things, and the fool spreadeth out his folly.  <span
id="fr_3222"></span>[3223](#fn_3222) Seek for wisdom among the evil and
thou shalt not find it.  <span id="fr_3223"></span>[3224](#fn_3223) The
rash man shall eat of the fruit of his own ways.  <span
id="fr_3224"></span>[3225](#fn_3224) The wise man by taking heed
avoideth the evil; but the fool is confident, and joins himself to it.
 <span id="fr_3225"></span>[3226](#fn_3225) A long-suffering man is
strong in his wisdom; the man of little mind is very unwise.  <span
id="fr_3226"></span>[3227](#fn_3226) He who oppresseth the poor
reproacheth his Maker.  <span id="fr_3227"></span>[3228](#fn_3227) The
tongue of the wise knoweth good things, but the mouth of fools speaketh
evil.  <span id="fr_3228"></span>[3229](#fn_3228) A quarrelsome man
preferreth strife, and every one that lifteth up his heart is unclean
before God.  <span id="fr_3229"></span>[3230](#fn_3229) Though hand join
with hand unjustly, they shall not be unpunished.  <span
id="fr_3230"></span>[3231](#fn_3230) He that loveth life must be sparing
to his mouth.  <span id="fr_3231"></span>[3232](#fn_3231) Insolence
goeth before bruising, and evil thoughts before a fall.  <span
id="fr_3232"></span>[3233](#fn_3232) He who closeth his eyes speaketh
perverse things, and provoketh all evil with his lips.  <span
id="fr_3233"></span>[3234](#fn_3233) The lips of a fool lead him into
evil, and the foolhardy speech calleth down death. The man of evil
counsel shall suffer much loss.  <span
id="fr_3234"></span>[3235](#fn_3234) Better is a poor man who is just
than a rich man that speaketh lies.  <span
id="fr_3235"></span>[3236](#fn_3235) It is a glory to a man to turn away
from evil words; but he that is foolish bindeth himself therewith.
 <span id="fr_3236"></span>[3237](#fn_3236) Love <span id="page_541">p.
541</span> <span id="vi.xii.iii.xliv-Page_541"></span>not detraction,
lest thou be rooted out.  <span id="fr_3237"></span>[3238](#fn_3237) The
bread of lying is sweet to a man, but afterwards his mouth shall be
filled with gravel.  <span id="fr_3238"></span>[3239](#fn_3238) He that
gaineth treasures with a lying tongue followeth vanity, and shall come
into the snares of death.  <span id="fr_3239"></span>[3240](#fn_3239)
Say thou nought in the ear of a fool, lest haply the wise mock at thy
words.  <span id="fr_3240"></span>[3241](#fn_3240) The bludgeon and the
sword and the arrow are hurtful things;  <span
id="fr_3241"></span>[3242](#fn_3241) so is the man who beareth false
witness against his friend.  <span id="fr_3242"></span>[3243](#fn_3242)
As the birds and the sparrows fly away, so the curse shall be vain and
shall not overtake him.  <span id="fr_3243"></span>[3244](#fn_3243)
Answer not an unwise man according to his lack of wisdom, lest thou
become like unto him; but answer a fool according to his folly, lest he
appear to himself to be wise.  <span
id="fr_3244"></span>[3245](#fn_3244) He who layeth wait for his friends
when he is discovered saith, I did it in sport.  <span
id="fr_3245"></span>[3246](#fn_3245) A faggot for the coals, and wood
for the fire, and a man of evil words for the tumult of strife.  <span
id="fr_3246"></span>[3247](#fn_3246) If thine enemy ask thee aught,
sparingly but with a loud voice,  <span
id="fr_3247"></span>[3248](#fn_3247) consent thou not to him, for there
are seven degrees of wickedness in his heart.  <span
id="fr_3248"></span>[3249](#fn_3248) The stone is heavy, and the sand
hard to be borne; but the anger of a fool is heavier than either;
indignation is cruel, anger is sharp, and envy is impatient.  <span
id="fr_3249"></span>[3250](#fn_3249) The impious man speaketh against
the poor; and he that trusteth in the audacity of his heart is most
foolish.  <span id="fr_3250"></span>[3251](#fn_3250) The unwise man
putteth forth all his anger, but the wise dealeth it out in parts.
 <span id="fr_3251"></span>[3252](#fn_3251) An evil son—his teeth are
swords, and his grinders are as harrows, to consume the weak from off
the earth, and the poor from among men.”

<span id="vi.xii.iii.xliv-p44"></span>Such are the lessons in which I
have been trained and therefore I was unwilling to return bite for bite,
and to attack you by way of retaliation; and I thought it better to
exorcise the madness of one who was raving, and to pour in the antidote
of a single book into his poisoned breast. But I fear I shall have no
success, and that I shall be compelled to sing the song of David, and to
take his words for my only consolation: <span
id="fr_3252"></span>[3253](#fn_3252)

<span id="vi.xii.iii.xliv-p46"></span>“The wicked are estranged from the
womb, they go astray even from the belly. They have spoken lies. Their
madness is like the madness of the serpent; like the deaf adder which
stoppeth her ears, which will not hear the voice of the charmers, and of
the magician wisely enchanting. God shall break their teeth in their
mouth; the Lord shall break the great teeth of the lions. They shall
come to nothing, like water that runneth away. He bendeth his bow until
they be brought low. Like wax that melteth, they shall be carried away;
the fire hath fallen upon them and they have not seen the sun.”

<span id="vi.xii.iii.xliv-p47"></span>And again: <span
id="fr_3253"></span>[3254](#fn_3253)

<span id="vi.xii.iii.xliv-p49"></span>“The righteous shall rejoice when
he seeth the vengeance upon the impious; he shall wash his hands in the
blood of the sinner. And man shall say, Verily, there is a reward for
the righteous; verily, there is a God that judgeth those that are on the
earth.”
