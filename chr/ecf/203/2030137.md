<span id="iv.viii.iv.xxxi-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.iv.xxxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXI</span>.—*Of Isaac* <span
id="fr_803"></span>[804](#fn_803) *the monk of Constantinople and
Bretanio the Scythian Bishop.*

<span id="iv.viii.iv.xxxi-p3"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.iv.xxxi-p3.1"></span>It</span> is related that Isaac, who
lived as a solitary at Constantinople, when he saw Valens marching out
with his troops, cried aloud, “Whither goest thou, O emperor? To fight
against God, instead of having Him as thy ally? ’Tis God himself who has
roused the barbarians against thee, because thou hast stirred many
tongues to blasphemy against Him and hast driven His worshippers from
their sacred abodes. Cease then thy campaigning and stop the war. Give
back to the flocks their excellent shepherds and thou shalt win victory
without trouble, but if thou fightest without so doing thou shalt learn
by experience how hard it is to kick against the pricks. <span
id="fr_804"></span>[805](#fn_804) Thou shalt never come back and shalt
destroy thy army.” Then in a passion the emperor rejoined, “I shall come
back; and I will kill thee, and so exact punishment for thy lying
prophecy.” But Isaac undismayed by the threat exclaimed, “If what I say
be proved false, kill me.”

<span id="iv.viii.iv.xxxi-p5"></span>Bretanio, a man distinguished by
various virtues, and entrusted with the episcopal government of all the
cities of Scythia, fired his soul with enthusiasm, and protested against
the corruption of doctrines, and the emperor’s lawless attacks upon the
saints, crying in the words of the godly David, “I spoke of thy
testimonies also before Kings and was not ashamed.” <span
