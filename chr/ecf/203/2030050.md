id="iv.viii.i.xxx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIX</span>.—*Consecration of the
Church of Jerusalem.—Banishment of St. Athanasius*.

<span id="iv.viii.i.xxx-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.i.xxx-p2.1"></span>All</span> the bishops who were present
at the council of Tyre, with all others from every quarter, were
commanded by the emperor to proceed to Ælia <span
id="fr_438"></span>[439](#fn_438.md) to consecrate the churches which he
had there erected. The emperor despatched also a number of officials of
the most kindly disposition, remarkable for piety and fidelity, whom he
ordered to furnish abundant supplies of provisions, not only to the
bishops and their followers, but to the vast multitudes who flocked from
all parts to Jerusalem. The holy altar was decorated with imperial
hangings and with golden vessels set with gems. When the splendid
festival was concluded, each bishop returned to his own diocese. The
emperor was highly gratified when informed of the splendour and
magnificence of the function, and blessed the Author of all good for
having thus granted his petition.

<span id="iv.viii.i.xxx-p4"></span>Athanasius having complained of his
unjust condemnation, the emperor commanded the bishops against whom this
complaint was directed to present themselves at court. Upon their
arrival, they desisted from urging any of their former calumnies,
because they knew how clearly they could be refuted; but they made it
appear that Athanasius had threatened to prevent the exportation of
corn. The emperor believed what they said, and banished him to a city of
Gaul called Treves <span id="fr_439"></span>[440](#fn_439.md) . This
occurred in the thirtieth year of the emperor’s reign <span
id="fr_440"></span>[441](#fn_440.md) .
