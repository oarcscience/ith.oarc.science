<span id="vi.xii.ii.xix"></span>

<span id="vi.xii.ii.xix-p1"></span> 18. After this preface as to the
falsification by heretics of the apostles, of both the Clements, and of
Dionysius, he at last comes to Origen; and these are his words:

<span id="vi.xii.ii.xix-p2"></span>“I have shewn from his own words and
writings how he himself complains of this and deplores it: He explains
clearly in the letter which he wrote to some of his intimate friends at
Alexandria what he suffered while living here in the flesh and in the
full enjoyment of his senses, by the corruption of his books and
treatises, or by spurious editions of them.”

<span id="vi.xii.ii.xix-p3"></span>He subjoins a copy of this letter;
and he who implores to the heretics the falsification of Origen’s
writings himself begins by falsifying them, for he does not translate
the letter as he finds it in the Greek, and does not convey to the
Latins what Origen states in his letter. The object of the whole letter
is to assail Demetrius the Pontiff of Alexandria, and to inveigh against
the bishops throughout the world, and to tell them that their
excommunication of him is invalid; he says further that he has no
intention of retorting their evil speaking; indeed he is so much afraid
of evil speaking that he does not dare to speak evil even of the devil;
insomuch that he gave occasion to Candidus an adherent of the errors of
Valentinian to represent him falsely as saying that the devil is of such
a nature as could be saved. But our friend takes no notice of the real
purport of the letter, and makes up for Origen an argument which he does
not use. I have therefore translated a part of the letter, beginning a
little way below what has been already spoken of, and have appended it
to the part which has been translated by him in a curtailed and
disingenuous manner, so that the reader may perceive the object with
which he suppressed the earlier part. He is contending, then, against
the Bishops of the church generally, because they had judged him
unworthy of its communion; and he continues as follows:

<span id="vi.xii.ii.xix-p4"></span>“Why need I speak of the language in
which the prophets constantly threaten and reprove the pastors, elders,
the priests and the princes? These things you can of yourselves without
my aid draw out from the Holy Scriptures, and you may clearly see that
it may well be the present time of which it is said <span
id="fr_3117"></span>[3118](#fn_3117.md) ‘Trust not in your friends, and do
not hope in princes,’ and that the prophecy is now gaining its
fulfilment, <span id="fr_3118"></span>[3119](#fn_3118.md) ‘The leaders of
my people have not known me; my sons are fools and not wise: they are
wise to do evil, but know not to do good.’ We ought to pity them, not to
hate them, to pray for them, not to curse them. For we have been created
for blessing, not for cursing. Therefore even Michael, <span
id="fr_3119"></span>[3120](#fn_3119.md) when he disputed against the devil
concerning the body of Moses, did not dare to bring a railing accusation
even for so great an evil, but said; ‘The Lord rebuke thee.’ And we read
something similar in Zachariah, <span
id="fr_3120"></span>[3121](#fn_3120.md) ‘The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan; the
Lord which hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee.’ So also we desire that
those who will not humbly accept the rebuke of their neighbours may be
rebuked of the Lord. But, since Michael says, ‘The Lord rebuke thee, O
Satan,’ and Zechariah says the same, the devil knows well whether the
Lord rebukes him or not; and must acknowledge the manner of the rebuke.”

<span id="vi.xii.ii.xix-p9"></span>Then, after a passage too long to
insert here, he adds:

<span id="vi.xii.ii.xix-p10"></span>“We believe that not only those who
have committed great sins will be cast out from the kingdom of heaven,
such as fornicators and adulterers, and those who defile themselves with
mankind, and thieves, but those also who have done evil of a less
flagrant kind, since it is written; <span
id="fr_3121"></span>[3122](#fn_3121.md) ‘Neither drunk<span
id="page_512">p. 512</span> <span
id="vi.xii.ii.xix-Page_512"></span>ards nor evil speakers shall inherit
the kingdom of God;’ and that the standard by which men will be judged
is as much the goodness as the severity of God. Therefore we strive to
act thoughtfully in all things, in drinking wine, and in moderation of
language, so that we dare not speak evil of any man. Now, because,
through the fear of God, we are careful not to utter maledictions
against any one, remembering that the words ‘He dared not bring against
him a railing accusation,’ are spoken of Michael in his dealing with the
devil; as it is said also in another place, <span
id="fr_3122"></span>[3123](#fn_3122.md) ‘They set at naught dominions and
rail at dignities;’ certain of these men who seek for matters of
contention, ascribe to us and our teaching the blasphemy (as to which
they have to lay to heart the words which apply to them, ‘Neither
drunkards nor evil speakers shall inherit the kingdom of God’), namely,
that the father of wickedness and perdition of those who shall be cast
out of the kingdom of God can be saved; a thing which not even a madman
can say.”

<span id="vi.xii.ii.xix-p13"></span>The rest which comes in the same
letter he has <span id="fr_3123"></span>[3124](#fn_3123.md) set down
instead of the later words of Origen which I have translated: “Now,
because through the fear of God we are careful not to utter maledictions
against any one,” and so on; he fraudulently cuts off the earlier part,
on which the later depends, and begins to translate the letter, as
though the former part began with this statement, and says:

<span id="vi.xii.ii.xix-p15"></span>“Some of those who delight in
bringing complaints against their neighbours, ascribe to us and our
teaching the crime of a blasphemy, which we have never spoken, (as to
which they must consider whether they are willing to stand by the decree
which says ‘The evil speakers shall not inherit the kingdom of God,’)
for they say that I assert that the father of the wickedness and
perdition of those who shall be cast out of the kingdom of God, that is,
the devil, will be saved; a thing which no man even though he had taken
leave of his senses and was manifestly insane could say.”

Candidus that Origen alleges this falsification. The story of Hilary's
being condemned through his writings having been falsified has no
foundation.](2030792.md)
