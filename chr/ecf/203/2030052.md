<span id="iv.viii.i.xxxii-p1"></span> Chapter XXXI.—*Apology for
Constantine*.

<span id="iv.viii.i.xxxii-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.i.xxxii-p2.1"></span>It</span> ought not to excite
astonishment that Constantine was so far deceived as to send so many
great men into exile: for he believed the assertions of bishops of high
fame and reputation, who skilfully concealed their malice. Those who are
acquainted with the Sacred Scriptures know that the holy David, although
he was a prophet, was deceived; and that too not by a priest, but by one
who was a menial, a slave, and a rascal. I mean Ziba, who deluded the
king by lies against Mephibosheth, and thus obtained his land <span
id="fr_444"></span>[445](#fn_444.md) . It is not to condemn the prophet
that I thus speak; but that I may defend the emperor, by showing the
weakness of human nature, and to teach that credit should not be given
only to those who advance accusations, even though they may appear
worthy of credit; but that the other party ought also to be heard, and
that one ear should be left open to the accused.
