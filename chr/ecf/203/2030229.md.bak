<span id="iv.x.xl-p1"></span>*XL. To Theodorus the Vicar.* <span
id="fr_1677"></span>[1678](#fn_1677.md)

<span id="iv.x.xl-p3"></span>The custom of the feast bids me write a
festal letter, but the cloud of our calamities suffers me not to gather
the usual happy fruit from it. Who is so stony-hearted as not to be
shocked and affrighted at the anger and grief of the Lord? Who is not
stirred to the memory of faults? Who does not look for the righteous
sentence? All this dims the brightness of the feast, but the Lord is
full of loving-kindness, and we trust He will not actually fulfil His
threats, but will look mercifully on us, scatter our sadness, open the
springs of mercy, and shew His wonted long suffering. I salute your
greatness, and beseech you to send me news of the health I sincerely
trust you are enjoying.
