<span id="iv.x.ciii-p1"></span> *CIII. To the Count Apollonius.* <span
id="fr_1826"></span>[1827](#fn_1826)

<span id="iv.x.ciii-p3"></span>The very godly bishops have been led to
travel to the imperial city by the calumnies uttered against me, and I
by their holinesses send your excellency my salutation, and pay the debt
of friendship, not indeed to wipe out the cherished obligation, but to
make it greater. For in truth the obligations of friendship are
increased by their discharge. That I should now be reaping the fruits of
calumny is not extraordinary, for, in that I am human, there is nothing
that I must not expect. All troubles of this kind must be borne by them
that have learned wisdom; one thing only is distressing—that harm should
accrue to the soul.
