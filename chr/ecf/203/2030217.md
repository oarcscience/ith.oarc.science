<span id="iv.x.xxviii-p1"></span> *XXVIII. To Jacobus, Presbyter and
Monk.*

<span id="iv.x.xxviii-p2"></span>They who have made the vigour of their
manhood bright by virtuous industry hasten happily towards old age,
gladdened by the recollection of their former victories, and for old
age’s sake rid of further struggle. This joy I think your own piety
possesses, and that you bear your old age the more easily for the
recollection of the labours of your youth.
