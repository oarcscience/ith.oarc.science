<p class="c46"><a name="iv.x.clxx-p1"></A>  <i>CLXIX. Letter written by Theodoretus, Bishop of Cyrus, from Chalcedon to Alexander of Hierapolis.</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2281"></A><A HREF="#fn_2281"><FONT SIZE="1">2282</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p class="c31"><a name="iv.x.clxx-p3"></A>We have left no means untried, of courtesy, of sternness, of entreaty, of eloquence before the most pious emperor, and the illustrious assembly, testifying before God who sees all things and our Lord Jesus Christ who shall judge the world in justice,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2282"></A><A HREF="#fn_2282"><FONT SIZE="1">2283</FONT></A>
 and the Holy Spirit and his elect angels, lest the Faith be despised which is now being corrupted by the maintainers and bold subscribers of heretical doctrines: and that charge be given for it to be laid down in the same terms as at Nic&aelig;a and for the rejection of the heresy introduced to the loss and ruin of true religion. Up to this time however we have produced not the slightest effect, our hearers being carried now in one direction and now in another.</p>  
<p class="c24"><a name="iv.x.clxx-p5"></A>Nevertheless all these difficulties have not been able to deter me from urging my point, but by God&#146;s grace I have pressed on. I have even stated to our pious emperor with an oath that it is perfectly impossible for Cyril and Memnon to be reconciled with me, and that we can never communicate with any one who has not previously repudiated the heretical Chapters. This then is our mind. The object of men who &#8220;seek their own not the things which are Jesus Christ&#146;s&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2283"></A><A HREF="#fn_2283"><FONT SIZE="1">2284</FONT></A>
 is to be reconciled with them against our will. But this is no business of mine, for God weighs our motives and tries our character, nor does He inflict chastisement for what is done against our will. Be it known to your holiness that if ever I said a word about our friend&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2284"></A><A HREF="#fn_2284"><FONT SIZE="1">2285</FONT></A>
 either before the very pious emperor or the illustrious assembly, I was at once branded as a rebel. So intensely is he hated by the court party. This is most annoying. The most pious emperor, especially, cannot bear to hear his name mentioned and says publicly &#8220;Let no one speak to me of this man.&#8221; On one occasion he gave an instance of this to me. Nevertheless as long as I am here I shall not cease to serve the interests of this our father, knowing that the impious have done him wrong.</p>  
<p class="c24"><a name="iv.x.clxx-p8"></A>My desire is that both your piety and I myself get quit of this. No good is to be hoped from it, in as much as all the judges trust in gold, and contend that the nature of the Godhead and manhood is one.</p>  
<p class="c24"><a name="iv.x.clxx-p9"></A>All the people however by God&#146;s grace are in good case, and constantly come out to us. I have begun to discourse to them and have celebrated very large communions.</p>  
<p class="c24"><a name="iv.x.clxx-p10"></A>On the fourth occasion I spoke at length about the faith and they listened with such delight that they did not go away till the seventh hour but held out even till the midday heat. An enormous crowd was gathered in a great court, with four verandahs, and I preached from above from a platform near the roof.</p>  
<p class="c24"><a name="iv.x.clxx-p11"></A>All the clergy with the excellent monks are on the contrary utterly opposed to me, so that when we came back from the Rufinianum, after the visit of the very pious emperor, stone throwing began and many of my companions were wounded, by the people and false monks.</p>  
<p class="c24"><a name="iv.x.clxx-p12"></A>The very pious emperor knew that the mob was gathered against me and coming up to me alone he said, &#8220;I know that you are assembling improperly.&#8221; Then, said I, &#8220;As you have allowed me to speak hear me with favour. Is it fair for excommunicated heretics to be doing duty in churches, while I, who am fighting for the Faith and am therefore excluded by others from communion, am not allowed to enter a church?&#8221; He replied &#8220;What am I to do?&#8221; I said, &#8220;What your <i>comes largitionum</i> did at Ephesus. When he found that some were <A NAME="page_342"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 342</FONT></A> <a name="iv.x.clxx-Page_342"></A>assembling, but that we were not assembling, he stopped them saying, &#145;If you are not peaceful I will allow neither party to assemble.&#146; It would have become your piety also to have given directions to the bishop here to forbid both the opposite party and ourselves to assemble before our meeting together to make known your righteous sentence to all.&#8221; To this he replied &#8220;It is not for me to order the bishop;&#8221; and I answered &#8220;Neither shall you command us, and we will take a church, and assemble. Your piety will find that there are many more on our side than on theirs.&#8221; In addition to this I pointed out that we had neither reading of the holy Scripture, nor oblation; but only &#8220;prayer for the Faith and for your majesty, and pious conversation.&#8221; So he approved, and made no further prohibition. The result is that increased crowds flock to us, and gladly listen to our teaching. I therefore beg your piety to pray that our case may have an issue pleasing to God. I am in daily danger, suspecting the wiles of both monks and clergy, as I witness alike their influence and their negligence.</p>
