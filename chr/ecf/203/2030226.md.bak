<span id="iv.x.xxxvii-p1"></span> *XXXVII. To Salustius the
Governor. <span id="fr_1675"></span>[1676](#fn_1675.md)*

<span id="iv.x.xxxvii-p3"></span>When rulers keep the scales of justice
true, and let them hang in even balance, they confer all kinds of
benefits upon their subjects; if they are also gifted with prudence and
further show loving-kindness to him that needs it, manifold advantages
accrue from their rule to them that live under it. Having enjoyed these
good things through your excellency, and having experienced them in your
former administration, they have now been moved with joy at the
information that to your munificence the helm of government has been
entrusted. I pray that they may gain yet greater good, that your
excellency may win still higher praise, and that the encomiums of your
eulogists may be vindicated by the addition to all your other honourable
titles to fame of that colophon <span
id="fr_1676"></span>[1677](#fn_1676.md) of good things—true religion. As I
was compelled to pass several days in Hierapolis I hoped to have the
pleasure of meeting your excellency, and persistently enquired of new
comers if the insignia of office had been conveyed to you. But I was
compelled by the divine feast of salvation to return in haste to the
city entrusted to me. Now however that I have received your excellency’s
letter, with very great pleasure I return your salutation, and without
delay have sent, as you requested, the honourable and pious deacon who
is by God’s grace a water-finder. May the Lord in His loving kindness
grant him both to do good service to the city and increase your
excellency’s glory.

<span id="iv.x.xxxvii-p4"></span> Colophon was one of the twelve Ionian
cities founded by Mopsus on the coast of Asia Minor and was one of the
claimants for being the birthplace of Homer. To put a colophon to
anything became a proverbial expression for to put the crowning touch,
to complete—from the fact according to Strabo (C. 643) that the
Colophonian cavalry was so excellent as at once to decide and finish a
battle in which it appeared. So the place and date of the edition of a
book, with the device of the printer, appended to old editions is called
a colophon.
