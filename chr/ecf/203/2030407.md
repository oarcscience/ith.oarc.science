addressed a book to the emperor Marcus Antoninus Verus, a disciple of
Fronto the orator, in behalf of the Christian doctrine. He wrote other
things also, among which are the following: *On the passover,* two
books, one book *On the lives of the prophets,* one book *On the
church,* <span id="fr_2422"></span>[2423](#fn_2422.md) one book *On the*

book *On the psalms* (?) one *On the senses,* one *On the soul and
body,* one *On baptism,* one *On truth,* one *On the generation of
Christ,* *On His prophecy* <span id="fr_2423"></span>[2424](#fn_2423.md)
one *On hospitality* and another which is called the *Key*—one *On the
devil,* one *On the Apocalypse of John,* one *On the corporeality of
God,* and six books of *Eclogues.* Of his fine oratorical genius,
Tertullian, in the seven books which he wrote against the church on
behalf of Montanus, satirically says that he was considered a prophet by
many of us.
