<span id="iv.viii.iii.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.iii.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XV</span>.—*Of the Jews; of
their attempt at building, and of the heaven-sent plagues that befel
them*.

<span id="iv.viii.iii.xv-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.iii.xv-p2.1"></span>Julian,</span> who had made his soul a
home of destroying demons, went his corybantic way, ever raging against
true religion. He accordingly now armed the Jews too against the
believers in Christ. He began by enquiring of some whom he got together
why, though their law imposed on them the duty of sacrifices, they
offered none. On their reply that their worship was limited to one
particular spot, this enemy of God immediately gave directions for the
re-erection of the destroyed temple, <span
id="fr_644"></span>[645](#fn_644.md) supposing in his vanity that he could
falsify the prediction of the Lord, of which, in reality, he exhibited
the truth. <span id="fr_645"></span>[646](#fn_645.md) The Jews heard his
words with delight and made known his orders to their countrymen
throughout the world. They came with haste from all directions,
contributing alike money and enthusiasm for the work; and the emperor
made all the provisions he could, less from the pride of munificence
than from hostility to the truth. He despatched also as governor a fit
man to carry out his impious orders. It is said that they made mattocks,
shovels, and baskets of silver. When they had begun to dig and to carry
out the earth a vast multitude of them went on with the work all day,
but by night the earth which had been carried away shifted back from the
ravine of its own accord. They destroyed moreover the remains of the
former construction, with the intention of building everything up
afresh; but when they had got together thousands of bushels of chalk and
lime, of a sudden a violent gale blew, and storms, tempests and
whirlwinds scattered everything far and wide. They still went on in
their madness, nor were they brought to their senses by the divine
longsuffering. Then first came a great earthquake, fit to strike terror
into the hearts of men quite ignorant of God’s dealings; and, when still
they were not awed, fire running from the excavated foundations burnt up
most of the diggers, and put the rest to flight. Moreover when a large
number of men were sleeping at night in an adjacent building it suddenly
fell down, roof and all, and crushed the whole of them. On that night
and also on the following night the sign of the cross of salvation was
seen brightly shining in the sky, and the very garments of the Jews were
filled with crosses, not bright but black. <span
id="fr_646"></span>[647](#fn_646.md) When God’s enemies saw these things,
in terror at the heaven-sent plagues they fled, and made their way home,
confessing the Godhead of Him who had been crucified by their fathers.
Julian heard of these events, for they were repeated by every one. But
like Pharaoh he hardened his heart. <span

id="iv.viii.iii.xv-p2.2"></span>

<span id="iv.viii.iii.xv-p3"></span> Bp. Wordsworth (Dict. Chris. Biog.
iii, 500) is in favour of the letter (Ep. 24<span
id="iv.viii.iii.xv-p3.1"></span>, Ed. Didot 350) in which Julian desires
the prayers of the Creator and professes a wish to rebuild and inhabit
Jerusalem with them after his return from the Persian war and there give
glory to the Supreme Being. It is addressed to his “brother Julus, the
very venerable patriarch.”

<span id="fn_645"></span>[103:646](2030098.htm#fr_645.md) <span
id="iv.viii.iii.xv-p3.2"></span>

<span id="iv.viii.iii.xv-p4"></span> This is the motive ascribed by the
Arian Philostorgius (vii. 9).

<span id="fn_646"></span>[103:647](2030098.htm#fr_646.md) <span
id="iv.viii.iii.xv-p4.1"></span>

<span id="iv.viii.iii.xv-p5"></span> “The curious statement that crosses
were imprinted on the bodies and clothes of persons present, is
illustrated in the original edition of Newman’s Essay (clxxxii.)” (i.e.
on ecclesiastical miracles) “by some parallel instances quoted by
Warburton from Casaubon and from Boyle. Such crosses, or cross-like
impressions, are said to have followed not only a thunderstorm, but also
an eruption of Vesuvius; these crosses were seen on linen garments, as
shirt sleeves, women’s aprons, that had lain open to the air, and upon
the exposed parts of sheets.” “Chrysostom (Ed. Montfaucon, vol. v. 271,
etc.) mentions ‘crosses imprinted upon garments,’ as a sign that had
occurred in his generation, close to the mention of the Temple of Apollo
that was overthrown by a thunderbolt, and separated from the wonders in
Palestine that he mentions subsequently.” Dr. E. A. Abbott.
*Philomythus,* 189.

<span id="fn_647"></span>[103:648](2030098.htm#fr_647.md) <span
id="iv.viii.iii.xv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iv.viii.iii.xv-p6"></span> This event “came like the vision of
Constantine, at a critical epoch in the world’s history. It was as the
heathen poet has it, a ‘dignus vindice nodus.’ All who were present or
heard of the event at the time, thought, we may be sure, that it was a
sign from God. As a miracle then it ranges beside those biblical
miracles in which, at some critical moment, the forces of nature are
seen to work strikingly for God’s people or against their enemies. In
the O.T. we have for example, the instances of the plagues of Egypt, the
passage of the Red Sea and the drowning of Pharaoh’s host, the crossing
of the Jordan, the prolongation of sunlight” (?darkness. Vide “A
misunderstood miracle” by the Rev. A. Smythe Palmer) “the destruction of
Sennacherib’s army; in the N.T. the stilling of the storm, and the
earthquake and the darkness at the crucifixion.” Bp. Wordsworth. Dict.
Ch. Biog. ii. 513. To biblical instances may be added the defeat of
Sisera and the fall of Aphek. But, too, for “the forces of nature,” when
the Armada was scattered, or when the siege of Leyden was raised the
course of modern history would have been changed. Cressy may also be
cited.

<span id="iv.viii.iii.xv-p7"></span>On the evidence for this event as
contrasted with the so-called ecclesiastical miracles, accepted and
defended by the late Cardinal Newman, vide Dr. E. A. Abbott’s
Philomythus pp. 1 and 5 et seq. “There is better evidence for this than
for any of the preceding miracles.” “The real solid testimony is that of
Ammianus Marcellinus (xxiii. 1). An impartial historian, who served
under Julian in the Persian campaign, and who, twenty years afterwards,
recorded the interruption of the building of the Temple by terrible
balls of fire.” “If Ammianus had lived nearer the time of the alleged
incident, or had added a statement of the evidence on which he based his
stories, the details might have been defended. As it is, the
circumstances, while favouring belief in his veracity do not justify us
in accepting anything more than the fact that the rebuilding of the
Temple was generally believed to have been stopped by some supernatural
fiery manifestation.” “The rebuilding was probably stopped by a violent
thunderstorm or thunderstorms.”
