<span id="iv.x.i-p4"></span>I. To an Unknown Correspondent.

<span id="iv.x.i-p5"></span>In the words of the prophet we find the wise
hearer mentioned with the excellent councillor. <span
id="fr_1608"></span>[1609](#fn_1608.md) I, however, send the book I have
written on the divine Apostle, not as much to a wise hearer as to a just
and clever judge. When goldsmiths wish to find out if their gold is
refined and unalloyed, they apply it to the touchstone; and just so I
sent my book to your reverence, for I wish to know whether it is what it
should be, or needs some fining down. You have read it and returned it,
but have said nothing to me on this point. Your silence leads me to
conjecture that the judge has given sentence of condemnation, but is
unwilling to hurt my feelings by telling me so. Pray dismiss any such
idea, and do not hesitate to tell me your opinion about the book.
