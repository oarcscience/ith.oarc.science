<span id="vi.xi.iii.lii-Page_482"></span>47. As regards the resurrection
of the flesh, I think that my translation contains the same doctrines
which are preached in the churches. As to the other points which relate
to the various orders of created beings, I have already said that they
have nothing to do with our faith in the Deity. But if he appeals to
these for the sake of calumniating others, though they have hitherto
presented no ground of offence, I do not deny his right to do so, if he
thinks well to revoke my judgment by which he might have been absolved,
and to enforce his own, by which he ought to be condemned. It is not my
judgment on him which is blameable, but his own, which takes others to
task for doing what he approves in himself. But this is a new method of
judgment according to which I am defending my own accuser, and he
considers that he has at last gained the victory over me when he has
brought himself in guilty. But suppose that a Synod of Bishops should
accept the sentences you have pronounced, and should demand that all the
books which contain the impugned doctrines, together with their authors,
should be condemned; then these books must be condemned first as they
stand in the Greek; and then what is condemned in Greek must undoubtedly
be condemned in the Latin. Then will come the turn of your own books;
they will be found to contain the same things, even according to your
own judgment. And as it has been of no advantage to Origen that you have
praised him, so it will be of no profit to you that I have pleaded in
your behalf. I shall then be bound to follow the judgment of the
Catholic Church whether it is given against the books of Origen or
against yours.
