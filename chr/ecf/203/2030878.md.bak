<span id="vi.xiii.xxx-p1"></span> 29. <span class="c14"><span
id="vi.xiii.xxx-p1.1"></span>The Third Day He Rose Again from the
Dead</span>. The glory of Christ’s resurrection threw a lustre upon
everything which before had the appearance of weakness and frailty. If a
while since it seemed to you impossible that an immortal Being could
die, you see now that He who has overcome death and is risen again
cannot be mortal. But understand herein the goodness of the Creator,
that so far as you by sinning have cast yourself down, so far has He
descended in following you. And do not impute lack of power to God, the
Creator of all things, by imagining his work to have ended in the fall
into an abyss which He in His redemptive purpose was unable to reach. We
speak of infernal and supernal, because we are bounded by the definite
circumference of the body, and are confined within the limits of the
region prescribed to us. But to God, Who is present everywhere and
absent nowhere, what is infernal and what supernal? Notwithstanding,
through the assumption of a body there is room for these also. The flesh
which had been deposited in the sepulchre, is raised, that that might be
fulfilled which was spoken by the Prophet, “Thou wilt not suffer Thy
Holy One to see corruption.” <span id="fr_3356"></span>[3357](#fn_3356.md)
He returned, therefore, a victor from the dead, leading with Him the
spoils of hell. For He led forth those who were held in captivity by
death, as He Himself had foretold, when He said, “When I shall be lifted
up from the earth I shall draw all unto Me.” <span
id="fr_3357"></span>[3358](#fn_3357.md) To this the Gospel bears witness,
when it says, “The graves were opened, and many bodies of saints which
slept arose, and appeared unto many, and entered into the holy
City,” <span id="fr_3358"></span>[3359](#fn_3358.md) that city, doubtless,
of which the Apostle says, “Jerusalem which is above is free, which is
the Mother of us all.” <span id="fr_3359"></span>[3360](#fn_3359.md) As
also he says again to the Hebrews, “It became Him, for Whom are all
things, and by Whom are all things, Who had brought many sons into
glory, to make the Author of their salvation perfect through
suffering.” <span id="fr_3360"></span>[3361](#fn_3360.md) Sitting,
therefore, on the right hand of God in the highest heavens, He placed
there that human flesh, made perfect through sufferings, which had
fallen to death by the lapse of the first man, but was now restored by
the virtue of the resurrection. Whence also the Apostle says, “Who hath
raised us up together and made us sit together in the heavenly
places.” <span id="fr_3361"></span>[3362](#fn_3361.md) For He was the
potter, Who, as the Prophet Jeremiah teaches, “took up again with His
hands, and formed anew, as it seemed good to Him, the vessel which had
fallen from His hands and was broken in pieces.” <span
id="fr_3362"></span>[3363](#fn_3362.md) And it seemed good to Him that the
mortal and corruptible body which He had assumed, this body raised from
the rocky sepulchre and rendered immortal and incorruptible, He should
now place not on the earth but in heaven, and at His Father’s right
hand. The Scriptures of the Old Testament are full of these mysteries.
No Prophet, no Lawgiver, no Psalmist is silent, but almost every one of
the sacred pages speaks of them. It seems superfluous, therefore, to
linger in collecting testimonies; yet we will cite some few, remitting
those who desire to drink more largely to the well-springs of the divine
volumes themselves.
