<span id="iv.viii.i.v-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.i.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.—</span>*The Letter of Arius to
Eusebius, Bishop of Nicomedia*

<span id="iv.viii.i.v-p2"></span>“<span class="c14"><span
id="iv.viii.i.v-p2.1"></span>To</span> his very dear lord, the man of
God, the faithful and orthodox Eusebius, Arius, unjustly persecuted by
Alexander the Pope <span id="fr_319"></span>[320](#fn_319.md) , on account
of that all-conquering truth of which you also are a champion, sendeth
greeting in the Lord.

<span id="iv.viii.i.v-p4"></span>“Ammonius, my father, being about to
depart for Nicomedia, I considered myself bound to salute you by him,
and withal to inform that natural affection which you bear towards the
brethren for the sake of God and His Christ, that the bishop greatly
wastes and persecutes us, and leaves no stone unturned <span
id="fr_320"></span>[321](#fn_320.md) against us. He has driven us out of
the city as atheists, because we do not concur in what he publicly
preaches, namely, God always, the Son always; as the Father so the Son;
the Son co-exists unbegotten with God; He is everlasting; neither by
thought nor by any interval does God precede the Son; always God, always
Son; he is begotten of the unbegotten; the Son is of God Himself.
Eusebius, your brother bishop of Cæsarea, Theodotus, Paulinus,
Athanasius, Gregorius, Aetius, and all the bishops of the East, have
been condemned because they say that God had an existence prior to that
of His Son; except Philogonius, Hellanicus, and Macarius, who are
unlearned men, and who have embraced heretical opinions. Some of them
say that the Son is an eructation, others that He is a production,
others that He is also unbegotten. These are impieties to which we
cannot listen, even though the heretics threaten us with a thousand
deaths. But we say and believe, and have taught, and do teach, that the
Son is not unbegotten, nor in any way part of the unbegotten; and that
He does not derive His subsistence from any matter; but that by His own
will and counsel He has subsisted before time, and before ages, as
perfect God, only begotten and unchangeable, and that before He was
begotten, or created, or purposed, or established, He was not. For He
was not unbegotten. We are persecuted, because we say that the Son has a
beginning, but that God is without beginning. This is the cause of our
persecution, and likewise, because we say that He is of the
non-existent <span id="fr_321"></span>[322](#fn_321.md) . And this we say,
because He is neither part of God, nor of any essential being <span
id="fr_322"></span>[323](#fn_322.md) . For this are we persecuted; the rest
you know. I bid thee farewell in the Lord, remembering our afflictions,
my fellow-Lucianist <span id="fr_323"></span>[324](#fn_323.md) , and true
Eusebius <span id="fr_324"></span>[325](#fn_324.md) .”

<span id="iv.viii.i.v-p10"></span>Of those whose names are mentioned in
this letter, Eusebius was bishop of Cæsarea <span
id="fr_325"></span>[326](#fn_325.md) , Theo<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>
<span id="iv.viii.i.v-Page_42"></span>dotus of Laodicea, Paulinus of
Tyre, Athanasius of Anazarbus, Gregorius of Berytus, and Aetius of
Lydda. Lydda is now called Diospolis. Arius prided himself on having
these men of one mind with himself. He names as his adversaries,
Philogonius, bishop of Antioch, Hellanicus, of Tripolis, and Macarius,
of Jerusalem. He spread calumnies against them because they said that
the Son is eternal, existing before all ages, of equal honour and of the
same substance with the Father.

<span id="iv.viii.i.v-p20"></span>When Eusebius received the epistle, he
too vomited forth his own impiety, and wrote to Paulinus, chief <span
id="fr_326"></span>[327](#fn_326.md) of the Tyrians, in the following
words.

Ant., s.v. 1st, it was applied to the teachers of converts, 2ndly, to
Bishops and Abbots, and was, 3rdly, confined to the Patriarchs of
Alexandria, Antioch, Jerusalem, Constantinople, and to the Bp. of Rome;
4thly, it was claimed by the Bp. of Rome exclusively.

<span id="iv.viii.i.v-p9"></span> Arius plays on the name Eusebius,
<span class="Greek"><span id="iv.viii.i.v-p9.1"></span>εὐσεβής</span>,
pious.

<span id="fn_325"></span>[41:326](2030025.htm#fr_325.md) <span
id="iv.viii.i.v-p10.1"></span>

<span id="iv.viii.i.v-p11"></span> From the phrase “<span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.viii.i.v-p11.1"></span>ὁ</span> <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.viii.i.v-p11.2"></span>ἀδελφός σου ὁ ἐν
Καισαρεί& 139·</span>,” it has been inferred by some that the two
Eusebii were actually brothers. Eusebius of Nicomedia, in the letter of
Chapter V., calls the Palestinian <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.viii.i.v-p11.3"></span>δεσπότης</span>; but this alone would not
be fatal to the brotherhood, for Seneca (*Ep. Mor.* 104), calls his
brother Gallio *dominus.* The phrase of Arius is not worth much against
the silence of every one else. Vid. Dict. Christ. Biog. Article,
Eusebius.

<span id="iv.viii.i.v-p12"></span>Theodotus, bishop of Laodicea, Syria,
(not the Phrygian Laodicea of the Apocalypse), was a Physician of the
body was well as of the soul (*Euseb.* H.E. vii. 32).

<span id="iv.viii.i.v-p13"></span>Paulinus, bishop first of Tyre, and
then of Antioch for six months, died in <span class="c14"><span
id="iv.viii.i.v-p13.1"></span>a.d.</span> 329. (*Philost.* H.E. iii. 15,
cf. Bishop Lightfoot in Dict. Christian Biog. Article, Eusebius of
Cæsarea).

<span id="iv.viii.i.v-p14"></span>Athanasius, bishop of Anazarbus, an
important town of Cilicia Campestris, is accused of dangerous Arianism
by his great namesake. (*Athan. de Synod,* 584.)

<span id="iv.viii.i.v-p15"></span>Gregorius succeeded Eusebius of
Nicomedia at Berytus (Beyrout), on the translation of the latter to
Nicomedia.

<span id="iv.viii.i.v-p16"></span>Aetius, Bishop of Lydda, (the Lydda of
the Acts, on the plain of Sharon, now Ludd, the city of El-Khudr, who is
identified with St. George), died soon after the Arian Synod of Antioch,
<span class="c14"><span id="iv.viii.i.v-p16.1"></span>a.d.</span> 330
(*Philost.* H.E. iii. 12), and is to be distinguished from the
arch-Arian Aetius, Julian’s friend, who survived till <span
class="c14"><span id="iv.viii.i.v-p16.2"></span>a.d.</span> 367 (*Phil.*
H.E. ix. 6).

<span id="iv.viii.i.v-p17"></span>Philogonius was raised to the
episcopate *per saltum,* like St. Ambrose (*Chrysost. Orat.* 71, tom. v.
p. 507), he preceded the Arian Paulinus.

<span id="iv.viii.i.v-p18"></span>Hellanicus was present at Nicæa, but
was driven from the See of Tripolis, in Phœnicia, by the Arians (*Athan.
Hist. Ar. ad Mon.* §5).

<span id="iv.viii.i.v-p19"></span>Macarius is praised by Athanasius
(*Orat. I. adv. Arian*. p. 291). On a possible “passage of arms” between
him and Eusebius of Cæsarea at Nicæa, vide Stanley, *Eastern Church,*
Lect. V. Cf. *post,* cap. xvii.
