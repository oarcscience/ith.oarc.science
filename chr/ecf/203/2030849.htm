<p class="c65"><a name="vi.xiii.i-p1"></A>  <span class="c21"><a name="vi.xiii.i-p1.1"></A>A Commentary on the Apostles&#146; Creed.</span></p>  
<p class="c41"><a name="vi.xiii.i-p2"></A>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>  
<p class="c31"><a name="vi.xiii.i-p3"></A>This exposition of the Creed was made at the request of Laurentius, a Bishop whose see is unknown, but is conjectured by Fontanini, in his life of Rufinus, to have been Concordia, Rufinus&#146; birthplace.</p>  
<p class="c24"><a name="vi.xiii.i-p4"></A>Its exact date cannot be fixed; but from the fact that he says nothing of his difficulty in writing Latin after being so long in the East, as he does in several of his books, and from the comparative ease of the style, it is most probable that it was written in the later years of his sojourn at Aquileia, that is, about 307&#8211;309.</p>  
<p class="c24"><a name="vi.xiii.i-p5"></A>Its value is considerable (1) as bearing witness to the state of the Creed in local churches at the beginning of the 5th century, especially their variations. (In the church of Aquileia, in Jes<i>u</i> Christ<i>o</i>. Patrem <i>invisibilem et impassibilem.</i> Resurrectio <i>hujus</i> carnis); (2) as showing the adaptation of Eastern ideas to the formation of Western theology; (3) as giving the Canon of the books of Scripture, and the Apocrypha of both the Old and New dispensations.</p>  
<p class="c24"><a name="vi.xiii.i-p6"></A>The exposition is clear and reasonable; and, with the exception of a very few passages, such as the argument from the Ph&#339;nix for the Virgin Birth of our Lord, is still of use to us.</p>  
<p class="c24"><a name="vi.xiii.i-p7"></A>We prefix the words of the creed on which Rufinus makes his commentary.</p>  
<p class="c24"><a name="vi.xiii.i-p8"></A>It seems desirable to give the original Latin, as well as the English version of the Creed of Aquileia. The words or letters which are peculiar to this creed are put in italics.</p>
