<span id="v.iii.xl-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="v.iii.xl-p2.1"></span>Clemens</span>, <span
id="fr_2443"></span>[2444](#fn_2443) presbyter of the Alexandrian
church, and a pupil of the Pantaenus mentioned above, led the
theological school at Alexandria after the death of his master and was
teacher of the Catechetes. He is the author of notable volumes, full of
eloquence and learning, both in sacred Scripture and in secular
literature; among these are the *Stromata,* eight books, *Hypotyposes*
eight books, *Against the nations* one book, *On pedagogy* <span
id="fr_2444"></span>[2445](#fn_2444) three books, *On the Passover,
Disquisition on fasting* and another book entitled, *What rich man is
saved*? one book *On Calumny, On ecclesiastical canons and against those
who follow the error of the Jews,* one book which he addressed to
Alexander bishop of Jerusalem. He also mentions in his volumes of
*Stromata* the work of Tatian *Against the nations* which we mentioned
above and a *Chronography* of one Cassianus, a work which I have not
been able to find. He also mentioned certain Jewish writers against the
nations, one Aristobulus and Demetrius and Eupolemus who after the
example of Josephus asserted the primacy of Moses and the Jewish people.
There is a letter of Alexander the bishop of Jerusalem who afterwards
ruled the church with Narcissus, on the ordination of Asclepiades the
confessor, addressed to the Antiochians congratulating them, at the end
of which he says “these writings honoured <span
id="fr_2445"></span>[2446](#fn_2445) brethren I have sent to you by the
blessed presbyter Clement, a man illustrious and approved, whom you also
know and with whom now you will become better acquainted a man who, when
he had come hither by the special providence of God, strengthened and
enlarged the church of God.” Origen is known to have been his disciple.
He flourished moreover during the reigns of Severus and his son
Antoninus.
