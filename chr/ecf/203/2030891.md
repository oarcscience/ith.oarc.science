<span id="vi.xiii.xliii-p1"></span> 42. But unbelievers cry, “How can
the flesh, which has been putrified and dissolved, or changed into dust,
sometimes also swallowed up by the sea, and dispersed by the waves, be
gathered up again, and again made one, and a man’s body formed anew out
of it?” To whom our first answer is in Paul’s words: “Thou fool, that
which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die. And that which thou
sowest, thou sowest not the body, which shall be, but bare grain of
wheat or of some other seed: but God giveth it a body as seemeth good to
Him.” <span id="fr_3413"></span>[3414](#fn_3413.md) Did you not believe
that that which you see taking place every year in the seeds which you
cast into the ground will come to pass in your flesh which by the law of
God is sown in the earth? Why, pray, have you so mean an opinion of
God’s power that you do not believe it possible for the scattered dust
of which each man’s flesh was composed to be re-collected and restored
to its own original fabric? Do you refuse to admit the fact when you see
mortal ingenuity search for veins of metal deeply buried in the ground,
and the experienced eye discover gold where the inexperienced thinks
there is nothing but earth? Why should we refuse to grant these things
to Him who made man, when he whom He made can do so much? And when
mortal ingenuity discovers that gold has its own proper vein, and silver
another, and that a far different vein of copper, and diverse and
distinct veins of iron and lead lie concealed beneath what has the
appearance of earth, shall divine power be thought unable to discover
and distinguish the component particles belonging to each man’s flesh,
even though they seem to be dispersed?
