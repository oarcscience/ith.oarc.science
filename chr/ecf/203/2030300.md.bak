<span id="iv.x.cxi"></span>

<span id="iv.x.cxi-p1"></span> *CXI. To Anatolius the Patrician.* <span
id="fr_1863"></span>[1864](#fn_1863.md)

<span id="iv.x.cxi-p3"></span>Your excellency will be recompensed for
the kindness you have shewn me by the God <span id="page_291">p.
291</span> <span id="iv.x.cxi-Page_291"></span>of all, for all that is
done for His sake has its reward. I laugh at all my slanderers. The
bodies of them who are most severely scourged do not feel the pain,
because the scourged flesh is deadened. Still I lament over them whose
unrestrained mouths utter such lies. In what way have the accusers of
the godly bishop Ibas <span id="fr_1864"></span>[1865](#fn_1864.md) been
wronged by me that they should utter such calumnies against me? To begin
with, I was not even one of the judges, for in obedience to the imperial
decree I was living at Cyrus. Moreover, as I have heard from many, they
all along treated my absence as a grievance, for I had arranged for
their partaking of the Holy Communion at the Easter feast of
salvation, <span id="fr_1865"></span>[1866](#fn_1865.md) and as they often
expressed a wish to meet me, I received them with kindness and advised
them as to the proper course to take. But that I may also speak in the
defence of the very godly bishop the lord Domnus, what was the proper
course for him to take? He was openly attacked; he saw men deposed by a
synodical sentence sent into another diocese, and resuming their
priestly functions in violation of the laws of the Church; he saw things
holy and divine laughed at and turned into ridicule by the enemies of
the Church; what was he to do? When he knew this he handed over the case
to others, and not only to the very godly lord Ibas, but also to the
holy lord bishop Symeon of Amida, that the metropolitans of the two
provinces might hear the charges. What fairness is there in charging the
same persons with cruelty and kindness? If we excommunicate, we run into
danger; if we do not excommunicate, we do not escape it. We alone of all
the world are objects of attack. Other dioceses are at peace. We alone
are exposed to calumniators,—specially I myself, though I took no part
in the trial, and am absolutely without responsibility in the matter.

<span id="iv.x.cxi-p6"></span>Thus have I been forced to write on
reading your lordship’s letter, and on learning from it how for these
reasons a great commotion has been made against me, a man confined to my
diocese; a man of peace; one not even deliberating with the godly
bishops of the province. As a matter of fact, although there have been
already two episcopal ordinations in our province, I took part in
neither. Were I not restrained by the imperial decree I would have gone
away, and spent the remainder of my days in some remote spot. I am faint
for the plots hatched against me. I am sure those Edessenes never put
together their slander against me of their own accord. They were
prompted to these attacks on me by their truly truthful neighbours. I
thank our Saviour that he has deemed me worthy of the beatitudes of the
Gospel, all unworthy though I be. For this reason I have gladly accepted
the sentence of relegation. I am ready for exile, and, for the sake of
the “hope laid up for me,” <span id="fr_1866"></span>[1867](#fn_1866.md)
welcome whatever fate they may inflict. I pray without ceasing for your
excellency, and beseech all the saints to share in my petitions.

<span id="iv.x.cxi-p2"></span> This letter is in reply to that written
by Anatolius on the receipt of Letter XCII. Garnerius, who places the
decree of relegation earlier than Tillemont, dates it at about the end
of April 448.

<span id="iv.x.cxi-p4"></span> The leaders of the attack on Ibas,
(bishop of Edessa and metropolitan, in 436) were four presbyters,
Samuel, Cyrus, Eulogius, and Maras. The cabal chose the moment for
action when Domnus visited Hierapolis for the enthronization of Stephen,
and in 445 Ibas was summoned by Domnus to Antioch, but did not come. In
448 the eighteen charges—some frivolous, some of gross heresy—were
formally heard, and Domnus decided in favor of Ibas. cf. p. 283, note.

excommunicate his accusers.
