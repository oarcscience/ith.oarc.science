<p class="c24"><a name="vi.xiii.xxv-p1"></A>  24. It is written that in our Lord&#146;s passion there was darkness over the earth from the sixth hour until the ninth. To this also you will find the Prophet witnessing, &#8220;Thy Sun shall go down at mid-day.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3333"></A><A HREF="#fn_3333"><FONT SIZE="1">3334</FONT></A>
 And again, the Prophet Zechariah, &#8220;In that day there shall be no more light. There shall be cold and frost in one day, and that day known to the Lord; and it shall be neither day nor night, but at evening time there shall be light.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3334"></A><A HREF="#fn_3334"><FONT SIZE="1">3335</FONT></A>
 What plainer language could the Prophet have used for his words to seem not so much a prophecy of the future as a narrative of the past? He foretold both the cold and the frost. For Peter was warming himself at the fire because it was cold: and he was suffering cold not only in respect of the time (the early hour), but also of his faith. There is added,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3335"></A><A HREF="#fn_3335"><FONT SIZE="1">3336</FONT></A>
 &#8220;and that day shall be known to the Lord; and it shall be neither day nor night.&#8221; What is &#8220;neither day nor night?&#8221; Did he not plainly speak of the darkness interposed in the day, and then the light afterwards restored? That was not day, for it did not begin with sun-rise, neither was it complete night, for it did not, when the day was ended, receive its due space from the beginning or prolong it to the end; but the light which had been driven away by the crime of wicked men is restored at evening time. For after the ninth hour, the darkness is driven away, and the sun is restored to the world. Again, another Prophet witnesses of the same, &#8220;The light shall be darkened upon the earth in the day-time.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3336"></A><A HREF="#fn_3336"><FONT SIZE="1">3337</FONT></A>
