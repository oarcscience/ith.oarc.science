<span id="iv.viii.iii.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.iii.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter IX</span>.—*Of what befell
Julianus, the Emperor’s Uncle, and Felix*.

<span id="iv.viii.iii.ix-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.iii.ix-p2.1"></span>Julianus</span> forthwith fell sick of a
painful disease; his entrails rotted away, and he was no longer able to
discharge his excrements through the normal organs of excretion, <span
id="fr_629"></span>[630](#fn_629.md) but his polluted mouth, at the instant
of his blasphemy, became the organ for their emission.

<span id="iv.viii.iii.ix-p4"></span>His wife, it is said, was a woman of
conspicuous faith, and thus addressed her spouse: “Husband, you ought to
bless our Saviour Christ for shewing you through your castigation his
peculiar power. For <span id="page_100">p. 100</span> <span
id="iv.viii.iii.ix-Page_100"></span>you would never have known who it is
who is being attacked by you if with his wonted long suffering he had
refrained from visiting you with these heaven-sent plagues.” Then by
these words and the heavy weight of his woes the wretched man perceived
the cause of his disease, and besought the emperor to restore the church
to those who had been deprived of it. He could not however gain his
petition, and so ended his days.

<span id="iv.viii.iii.ix-p5"></span>Felix too was himself suddenly
struck down by a heaven-sent scourge, and kept vomiting blood from his
mouth, all day and all night, for all the vessels of his body poured
their convergent streams to this one organ: so when all his blood was
shed he died, and was delivered to eternal death.

<span id="iv.viii.iii.ix-p6"></span>Such were the penalties inflicted on
these men for their wickedness.
