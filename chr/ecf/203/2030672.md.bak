<span id="vi.xi.ii.xxxv-p1"></span> 32. In this passage all room for
doubt is removed. In the former passage you said that those who before
hoped in Christ are those who, before they were born in bodies in this
visible world, dwelt in heaven and had hope in Christ. But, to prevent
this being supposed to be your own doctrine, you introduced another
interpretation, namely, that at that time when every knee shall bow to
Jesus as Lord, the universal creation, of things heavenly, earthly and
infernal, will consist of persons subjected to him in two different
ways, some willingly, some by necessity. You add that all the saints,
who now believe on him through the word of preaching are subject to him
willingly, and that these are called Fore-hopers, that is those who have
beforehand hoped in Christ: but that those who are subject to him by
necessity are those who have not believed now through the preaching of
the word, but who then will no longer be able to deny him, such as the
devil and his angels, and those who with them have been obliged by
necessity to believe: and that all these, and amongst them the devil and
his angels, who shall afterwards believe, shall not be called
Fore-hopers, because that name belongs to those who believed in Christ
before, and hoped in him willingly, whereas these others only did so
afterward and by necessity: and you add that, consequently, they will
receive different rewards. But you assign rewards, though they may be
inferior ones, to all, even to those who now do not believe, that is,
the devil and his angels; and, though now you hold the mere opinion, not
the mature judgment, of another worthy of condemnation who thinks it
possible that the devil may one day have a respite from punishment, you
bring him into the kingdom of God to receive the second reward. This
also you wish us to understand, that, as it matters not whether Christ
is preached in truth or by necessity, so it is of no consequence whether
we believe by necessity or willingly.
