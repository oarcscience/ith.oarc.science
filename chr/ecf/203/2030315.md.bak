<span id="iv.x.cxxvi"></span>

<span id="iv.x.cxxvi-p1"></span> *CXXV. To Aphthonius, Theodoritus,
Nonnus, Scylacius, Apthonius, Joannes, Magistrates of the Zeugmatensis.*

<span id="iv.x.cxxvi-p2"></span>I know the strength and stability of
your faith, and have been filled with the greatest possible delight,
for, since we worshippers of the eternal Trinity constitute one body, it
is only natural that together with the members that are sound the rest
of the members should rejoice. So says the divine Apostle; “Whether one
member be honoured all the members rejoice with it.” <span
id="fr_1924"></span>[1925](#fn_1924.md) I therefore rejoice with you in
your struggles on behalf of the apostolic doctrines and your following
of the famous Naboth in more excellent things. Naboth for his vineyard’s
sake suffered most unrighteous slaughter, because he would not give up
the heritage of his fathers. You are fighting not for vineyards, but for
divine doctrines, and reject this new-fangled and spurious heresy as
blackening the brightness of the teaching of the gospel; you do not
suffer the number of the blessed Trinity to be diminished or increased.
For it is diminished by those who ascribe the passion of the only
begotten to the Godhead; it is increased by those who have the audacity
to introduce a second son. You believe in one only begotten, as you do
in one Father and in one Holy Ghost. In the only begotten made flesh you
behold the assumed nature which He took from us and offered on our
behalf. The denial of this nature puts our salvation far from us; for if
the Godhead of the only begotten is impassible, as the nature of the
Trinity is impassible, and we refuse to acknowledge that which is by
nature adapted to suffer, then the preaching of a passion which never
happened is idle and vain. For if that which suffers has no existence
how could there be a passion? We declare that the divine nature is
impassible;—a doctrine confessed by our opponents as well as by
ourselves. How then could there be a passion when there is no subject
capable of suffering? The great mystery of the œconomy will appear an
appearance, a mere seeming instead of the reality. This is the fable
started by Valentinus, Bardesanes, Marcion and Manes. But the teaching
handed down to the churches from the beginning recognises, even after
the incarnation, one Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, and confesses the same
to be everlasting God, and man made at the end of days; made man not by
the mutation of the Godhead but by the assumption of the manhood. For
suppose the divine nature to have undergone mutation into the human
nature, then it did not remain what it was; and if it is not what it
was, they who have these objects of worship are false in calling Him
God. We, on the contrary, recognise the only begotten Son of God to be
immutable as God, and Son of the very God. For we have learnt from the
divine Scripture that being in the form of God He took the form of the
servant; <span id="fr_1925"></span>[1926](#fn_1925.md) and took on Him the
seed of Abraham, not was changed into Abraham’s seed; and shared just as
we do both in flesh and blood and in a soul immortal and immaculate.
Preserving these for our sinful bodies He offered His <span
id="page_300">p. 300</span> <span
id="iv.x.cxxvi-Page_300"></span>sinless body and for our souls His soul
free from all stain. It is for this reason that we have the hope of the
common resurrection for the race will assuredly share with its first
fruits, and as we have shared with Adam in his death, so too with Christ
our Saviour shall we be sharers in His life. This the divine Apostle has
plainly taught us, for “now” he says “is Christ risen from the dead and
become the first fruits of them that slept. For since by man came death,
by man came also the resurrection of the dead, for as in Adam all die,
even so in Christ shall all be made alive.” <span
id="fr_1926"></span>[1927](#fn_1926.md)

<span id="iv.x.cxxvi-p6"></span>I write thus not to inform you but to
remind you. I have tried to be brief, but I fear I have transgressed the
limits of a letter. I was however urged to write by the very reverend
and godly presbyter and archimandrite Mecimas, who, in obedience to the
law of love, has undertaken so long a journey, told us of your
excellency’s zeal, and begged us to inflame it by a letter. I have
therefore granted his supplication, and written my letter, and I implore
the Lord of all to keep you safe in the faith and make stronger than him
who sifts us. <span id="fr_1927"></span>[1928](#fn_1927.md)
