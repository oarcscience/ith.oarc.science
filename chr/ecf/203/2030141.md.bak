<span id="iv.viii.v.i-p3"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.v.i-p3.1"></span>How</span> the Lord God is long suffering
towards those who rage against him, and chastises those who abuse his
patience, is plainly taught by the acts and by the fate of Valens. For
the loving Lord uses mercy and justice like weights and scales; whenever
he sees any one by the greatness of his errors over-stepping the bounds
of loving kindness, by just punishment He hinders him from being carried
to further extremes.

<span id="iv.viii.v.i-p4"></span>Now Gratianus, the son of
Valentinianus, and nephew of Valens, acquired the whole Roman Empire. He
had already assumed the sceptre of Europe on the death of his father, in
whose life-time he had shared the throne. On the death of Valens without
issue he acquired in addition Asia, and the portions of Libya. <span
