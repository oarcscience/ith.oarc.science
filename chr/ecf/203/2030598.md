id="v.iv.lxxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter LXXVIII.</span>

<span id="v.iv.lxxix-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="v.iv.lxxix-p2.1"></span>Victor, <span
id="fr_2706"></span>[2707](#fn_2706.md) </span> bishop of Cartenna in
Mauritania, wrote one long book against the Arians, which he sent to
king Genseric by his followers, as I learned from the preface to the
work, <span id="fr_2707"></span>[2708](#fn_2707.md) and a work *On the
repentance of the publican,* <span id="fr_2708"></span>[2709](#fn_2708.md)
in which he drew up a rule of life for the penitent, according to the
authority of Scriptures. He also wrote a consolatory work to one
Basilius, *On the death of a son,* filled with resurrection hope and
good counsel. He also composed many Homilies, which have been arranged
as continuous works and are as I know, made use of by brethren anxious
for their own salvation.
