<span id="iv.x.lxxv-p1"></span> *LXXV. To the Clergy of Berœa.*

<span id="iv.x.lxxv-p2"></span>I perceive that it is with reason that I
am well disposed to your reverences, for I have been assured by your
kindly letter that my affection was returned. For this affection of mine
towards you I have many reasons. First of all there is the fact that
your father, that great and apostolic man, was my father too. Secondly I
look upon that truly religious bishop, <span
id="fr_1719"></span>[1720](#fn_1719.md) who now rules your church, as I
might on a brother both in blood and in sympathy. Thirdly there is the
near neighbourhood of our cities, and fourthly our frequent intercourse
with one another, which naturally begets friendship and increases it
when it is begotten. If you like, I will name yet a fifth, and that is
that we have the same close connexion with you as the tongue has with
the ears, the former uttering speech, and the latter receiving it; for
you most gladly listen to my words, and I am delighted to let fall my
little drop upon you. <span id="page_272">p. 272</span> <span
id="iv.x.lxxv-Page_272"></span>But the colophon <span
id="fr_1720"></span>[1721](#fn_1720.md) of our union is our harmony in
faith; our refusal to accept any spurious doctrines; our preservation of
the ancient and apostolic teaching, which has been brought to you by
hoary wisdom and nurtured by virtue’s hardy toil. I beseech you
therefore to take greater care of the flock, to preserve it unharmed for
the Shepherd, and boldly to utter the famous words of the patriarch
“that which was born of beasts I offered not unto Thee.” <span
id="fr_1721"></span>[1722](#fn_1721.md)

<span id="iv.x.lxxv-p3"></span> Theoctistus; who, we learn from Letter
CXXXIV, did not prove himself a friend in need, succeeded Acacius in
438. Garnerius, apparently on insufficient grounds, would therefore date
the letter before this year.
