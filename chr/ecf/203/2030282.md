<span id="iv.x.xciii-p1"></span> *XCIII. To Senator <span
id="fr_1804"></span>[1805](#fn_1804.md) the Patrician.*

<span id="iv.x.xciii-p3"></span>I cherish an indelible memory of your
magnificence, and now by very religious and holy bishops I salute you.
The very holy lord bishop Domnus has arranged for them to journey to the
imperial city in order to put an end to the false charges raised against
me. For certain men have contrived manifest calumnies against me, and
have grievously disturbed the churches for whose sake the Lord Christ
“endured the Cross despising the shame”; <span
id="fr_1805"></span>[1806](#fn_1805.md) in whose behalf the band of the
divine apostles and companies of victorious martyrs were delivered to
many kinds of death. On behalf of their peace I call on your
magnificence to contend. It had been easy for the God of all to have
nodded His head and scattered the lowering clouds; but He bides His
time, and thereby at once shews the endurance of them that are assailed,
and gives us opportunities of doing good.
