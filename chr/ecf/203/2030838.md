<span id="vi.xii.iii.xxxvi-p1"></span> 35. But my fault, you will say,
was this, that I did not restrain your accusers who were my friends.
Why, I had enough to do to answer their accusations against myself; for
they charged me with hypocrisy, <span
id="fr_3200"></span>[3201](#fn_3200.md) as I could shew by producing their
letters, because I kept silence when I knew you to be a heretic; and
because by incautiously maintaining peace with you, I fostered the
intestine wars of the Church. You call them my disciples; they suspect
me of being your fellow-disciple; and, because I was somewhat sparing in
my rejection of your praises, they think me to be initiated, along with
you, into the mysteries of heresy. This was the service your Prologue
did me; you injured me more by appearing as my friend than you would had
you shewn yourself my enemy. They had persuaded themselves once for all
(whether rightly or wrongly is their business) that you were a heretic.
If I should determine to defend you, I should only succeed in getting
myself accused by them along with you. They cast in my teeth your
laudation of me, which they suppose to have been written not in craft
but sincerity; and they vehemently reproach me with the very things
which you always praised in me. What am I to do? To turn my disciples
into my accusers for your sake? To receive on my own head the weapons
which were hurled against my friend?
