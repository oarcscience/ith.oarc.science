id="fr_2596"></span>[2597](#fn_2596.md) </span> the presbyter wrote to
Queen Flaccilla seven books *Against the Arians and Macedonians,*
arguing and convicting them by the testimonies of the very Scriptures
which they used, in perverted meaning, for blasphemy. He wrote also a
book which, together with a certain presbyter named Marcellinus, he
addressed to the emperors Valentinianus, Theodosius and Arcadius, in
defence of their fellow Christians. From this it appears that he
acquiesced in the Luciferian schism, in that in this same book he blames
Hilary of Poitiers and Damasus, bishop of Rome, for giving ill-advised
counsel to the church, advising that the apostate <span
id="fr_2597"></span>[2598](#fn_2597.md) bishops should be received into
communion for the sake of restoring the peace. For it was as displeasing
to the Luciferians to receive the bishops who in the Ariminian council
had communed with Arius, as it was to the Novatians to receive the
penitent apostates.
