<span id="vi.xi.iii.v-p1"></span> 4. But I should like, now that I have
satisfied you on my own account, and supported my opinion by an
anathema, to make this plain to you further, that he himself declares
that in certain orgies and mystical societies to which he belongs
perjury is practised by the votaries and associates. That is a certain
and most true saying of our God, “By their fruits ye shall know
them,” <span id="fr_2933"></span>[2934](#fn_2933.md) and this also “A tree
is known by its fruits.” <span id="fr_2934"></span>[2935](#fn_2934.md)
Well: he says that I have accepted this doctrine of perjury. If then I
have been trained to this practice, and this evil tree has indeed its
roots within me, it is impossible but that corresponding fruits should
have grown upon me, and also that I should have gathered some society of
mystic associates around me. As regards myself whom alone he seeks to
injure by all <span id="page_462">p. 462</span> <span
id="vi.xi.iii.v-Page_462"></span>that he writes, I will not bear witness
to myself, nor will I say that there are cases of necessity in which it
is right to swear: for I wish to avoid reproach through timidity if not
through prudence; and, at all events, if I fail in obedience to the
command, I will acknowledge my error. I will therefore make no boast of
this. But, whether I have erred or acted prudently, he at all events can
lay his finger on no act of mine by which he can convict me. But I can
shew from his writings, that he not only holds this doctrine of perjury,
but practises this foul vice as a sacred duty. I will bring nothing
against him which has been trumped up by ill will, as he does against
me; but I will produce him and his writings as witnesses against
himself, so that it may be made clear that it is not his enemies who
accuse but he who convicts himself.
