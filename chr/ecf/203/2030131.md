<span id="iv.viii.iv.xxv-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.iv.xxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXV</span>.—*Of what other monks
were distinguished at this period*.

<span id="iv.viii.iv.xxv-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.iv.xxv-p2.1"></span>There</span> were also other men at this
period who emitted the bright rays of the philosophy of solitary life.
In the Chalcidian <span id="fr_773"></span>[774](#fn_773.md) desert Avitus,
Marcianus <span id="fr_774"></span>[775](#fn_774.md) and Abraames, <span
id="fr_775"></span>[776](#fn_775.md) and more besides whom I cannot easily
enumerate, strove in their bodies of sense to live a life superior to
sense. In the district of Apamea, <span
id="fr_776"></span>[777](#fn_776.md) Agapetus, <span
id="fr_777"></span>[778](#fn_777.md) Simeon, <span
id="fr_778"></span>[779](#fn_778.md) Paulus and others reaped the fruits of
the highest wisdom.

<span id="iv.viii.iv.xxv-p9"></span>In the district of the
Zeugmatenses <span id="fr_779"></span>[780](#fn_779.md) were Publius <span
id="fr_780"></span>[781](#fn_780.md) and Paulus. In the Cyrestian <span
id="fr_781"></span>[782](#fn_781.md) the famous Acepsemas had been shut up
in a cell for sixty years without being either seen or spoken to. The
admirable Zeumatius, though bereft of sight, used to go about confirming
the sheep, and fighting with the wolves; so they burnt his cell, but the
right faithful general Trajanus got another built for him, and paid him
besides other attentions. In the neighbourhood of Antioch,
Marianus, <span id="fr_782"></span>[783](#fn_782.md) Eusebius, <span
id="fr_783"></span>[784](#fn_783.md) Ammianus, <span
id="fr_784"></span>[785](#fn_784.md) Palladius, <span
id="fr_785"></span>[786](#fn_785.md) Simeon, <span
id="fr_786"></span>[787](#fn_786.md) Abraames, <span
id="fr_787"></span>[788](#fn_787.md) and others, preserved the divine image
unimpaired; but of all these the lives have been recorded by us. But the
mountain which is in the neighbourhood of the great city was decked like
a meadow, for in it shone Petrus, the Galatian, his namesake the
Egyptian, <span id="page_129">p. 129</span> <span
id="iv.viii.iv.xxv-Page_129"></span>Romanus Severus, <span
id="fr_788"></span>[789](#fn_788.md) Zeno, <span
id="fr_789"></span>[790](#fn_789.md) Moses, and Malchus, <span
id="fr_790"></span>[791](#fn_790.md) and many others of whom the world is
ignorant, but who are known to God.
