<span id="vi.xi.ii.xviii-p1"></span> 17. But I have said that these men
would have been unable to find grounds for accusation on the points I
have mentioned, however they may take them, unless they had first
falsified them. It appears to me therefore desirable that the chief
matter on which they have laid their forgers’ hands should be inserted
in this Apology, lest they should think that I am intentionally
withdrawing it from notice because they after making their own additions
to it allege it as a ground of false accusation. In the book which I
translated there is a passage in which I examine the tenets of those who
believe that God has a bodily shape and who describe him as clothed with
human members and dress. This is openly asserted <span id="page_443">p.
443</span> <span id="vi.xi.ii.xviii-Page_443"></span>by the heretical
sects of the Valentinians and Anthropomorphites, and I see that those
who are now our accusers have been far too ready to hold out the hand to
them. Origen in this passage has defended the faith of the church
against them, affirming that God is wholly without bodily form, and
therefore also invisible; and then, following out his scrutiny in a
logical manner, he says a few words in answer to the heretics, which I
thus translated into Latin. <span id="fr_2846"></span>[2847](#fn_2846)

<span id="vi.xi.ii.xviii-p3"></span>“But these assertions will perhaps
be held to have little authority by those whose desire is to be
instructed out of the Holy Scriptures in the things of God, and who
require that from that source should be drawn the proof of the
preïminence of the nature of God over that of the human body. Consider
whether the Apostle does not say the same thing when he speaks thus of
Christ: <span id="fr_2847"></span>[2848](#fn_2847) “Who is the image of
the invisible God, the first born of every creature.” The nature of God
is not, as some think, visible to some and not to others, for the
Apostle does not say The image of God who is invisible to men, or to
sinners; but he speaks quite distinctly of the nature of God in itself,
where he says “The image of the invisible God.” John also says in his
Gospel, <span id="fr_2848"></span>[2849](#fn_2848) “No man hath seen God
at any time,” by which he distinctly declares: to all who can
understand, that there is no being to whom God is visible; not as if he
were naturally visible and, like a being of attenuated substance,
escaped and eluded our glance; but that, in his own nature it is
impossible for him to be seen. But perhaps you will ask me my opinion as
to the Only begotten himself. Well, if I should say that even to him the
nature of God is invisible, since it is its very nature to be invisible,
do not dismiss my answer as if it were impious or absurd, for I will at
once give you my reason for it. Observe that seeing is a different thing
from knowing. Seeing and being seen belong to bodies; to know and to be
known belong to the intellectual nature. Whatever then is merely a
property of bodies, this we must not attribute to the Father or the Son;
but that which belongs to the nature of Deity governs the relations of
the Father and the Son. Moreover, Christ himself in the Gospel <span
id="fr_2849"></span>[2850](#fn_2849) did not say “No man seeth the Son
but the Father nor the Father but the Son,” but “No man knoweth the Son
but the Father, neither doth any one know the Father but the Son.” By
this it is clearly shown that what is called seeing and being seen in
the case of bodily existence is called knowledge in the case of the
Father and the Son: their intercourse is maintained through the power of
knowledge not through the weakness of visibility. Since, therefore, an
incorporeal nature cannot properly be said to see or to be seen,
therefore in the Gospel it is not said either that the Father is seen by
the Son or the Son by the Father but that each is known by the other.
And if any one should ask how it is that it is said <span
id="fr_2850"></span>[2851](#fn_2850) “Blessed are the pure in heart for
they shall see God,” I think that this text will confirm my assertion
still more. For what else is it to see God with the heart than,
according to the explanation I have given above, to understand Him with
the mind and to know Him?”
