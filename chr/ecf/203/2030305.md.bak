<span id="iv.x.cxvi-p1"></span> *CXV. To Apella.*

<span id="iv.x.cxvi-p2"></span>When I undertook the direction of the see
of Cyrus, I procured for it from all directions men who practised
necessary arts, and besides this induced skilful physicians to live
there. Of these one is the reverend presbyter Peter, who practises his
profession with wisdom, and adorns it by his character. On my departure,
several have left the city and Peter also has determined to leave. Under
these circumstances I beseech your excellency to give him your kind
care. He is well able to attend the sick and to wage war against their
ailments.
