<span id="iv.x.cxxviii-p1"></span> *CXXVII. To Jobius, Presbyter and
Archimandrite.* <span id="fr_1929"></span>[1930](#fn_1929.md)

<span id="iv.x.cxxviii-p3"></span>The patriarch Abraham won a victory in
his old age. <span id="fr_1930"></span>[1931](#fn_1930.md) The great Moses
was now an old man when, so long as he stretched out his hands in
prayer, he vanquished Amalek. <span id="fr_1931"></span>[1932](#fn_1931.md)
The divine Samuel <span id="fr_1932"></span>[1933](#fn_1932.md) was an old
man when he put the aliens to flight. These are emulated by your
venerable old age. In our wars for true religion’s sake you are playing
the man, and championing the cause of the gospel doctrines, and putting
young men in the shade by the vigour of your spirit.

<span id="iv.x.cxxviii-p7"></span>I rejoice to hear it, and am glad, and
long to embrace your right venerable gray hairs. This I cannot do, for
your reverence is kept at home by your years, and I am kept in durance
here by the imperial decree. But I cheat my love by this letter, and
give your piety this most loving embrace. I call upon you in your
prayers to help the churches now whelmed in the storm, and to win for me
the divine support, assailed as I am for the sake of the doctrines of
the gospel, and standing sorely in need of help from above.

<span id="iv.x.cxxviii-p2"></span> Jobius was an orthodox archimandrite
of Constantinople, and subscribed the deposition of Eutyches by the hand
of his deacon Andreas at Constantinople in 448. (Labbe iv, 232) In 450
Leo addresses him with other archimandrites (Ep. LXXI page 1012). This
letter seems to have been written about the time of the Latrocinium.
