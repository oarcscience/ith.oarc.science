<span id="vi.xii.i.xx-p1"></span> 19. I am told that he also carps at me
for the translation I have given of a phrase in the Second Psalm. In the
Latin it <span id="page_493">p. 493</span> <span
id="vi.xii.i.xx-Page_493"></span>stands: “Learn discipline,” in the
Hebrew it is written Nescu Bar; and I have given it in my commentary,
Adore the Son; and then, when I translated the whole Psalter into the
Latin language, as if I had forgotten my previous explanation, I put
“Worship purely.” No one can deny, of course, that these interpretations
are contrary to each other; and we must pardon him for being ignorant of
the Hebrew writing when he is so often at a loss even in Latin. Nescu,
translated literally, is Kiss. I wished not to give a distasteful
rendering, and preferring to follow the sense, gave the word Worship;
for those who worship are apt to kiss their hands and to bare their
heads, as is to be seen in the case of Job who declares that he has
never done either of these things, <span
id="fr_3039"></span>[3040](#fn_3039.md) and says <span
id="fr_3040"></span>[3041](#fn_3040.md) “If I beheld the sun when it
shined, or the moon walking in brightness, and my heart rejoiced in
secret and I kissed my hand with my mouth, which is a very great
iniquity, and a lie to the most high God.” The Hebrews, according to the
peculiarity of their language use this word Kiss for adoration; and
therefore I translated according to the use of those whose language I
was dealing with. The word Bar, however in Hebrew has several meanings.
It means Son, as in the words Barjona (son of a dove) Bartholomew (son
of Tholomæus), Bartimæus, Barjesus, Barabbas. It also means Wheat, and A
sheaf of corn, and Elect and Pure. What sin have I committed, then, when
a word is thus uncertain in its meaning, if I have rendered it
differently in different places? and if, after taking the sense “Worship
the Son” in my Commentary, where there is more freedom of discussion, I
said “Worship purely” or “electively” in my version of the Bible itself,
so that I should not be thought to translate capriciously or give
grounds for cavil on the part of the Jews. This last rendering,
moreover, is that of Aquila and Symmachus: and I cannot see that the
faith of the church is injured by the reader being shewn in how many
different ways a verse is translated by the Jews.
