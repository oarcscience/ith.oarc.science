<span id="iv.x.cxxiv-p1"></span> *CXXIII. To the Same.*

<span id="iv.x.cxxiv-p2"></span>Your letter was a long one, and a
pleasant one, and it shews how warm and genuine is your affection. So
delighted am I with it that I am not at all sorry for having erroneously
conjectured the meaning of the beginning of your former one. For my
misapprehension of the intention of your letter has disclosed your
brotherly love, made plain the sincerity of your faith, and shewn your
zeal for the true religion. We have indeed shared between us the words
and the trials of the prophet; your holiness has used the words; I am
buffeted by the hurricane and billows, and against the rowers of the
ship I exclaim in his words “They that observe lying vanities forsake
their own mercy.” <span id="fr_1921"></span>[1922](#fn_1921) Perhaps He
who is Jonah’s Lord and mine will grant that I too may rise and be
released from the monster. But if the surge continue to boil I trust
that even thus I shall enjoy the divine protection, and learn by my own
experience how His strength is “made perfect in weakness,” <span
id="fr_1922"></span>[1923](#fn_1922) for He has measured the peril by my
infirmity. The divine prophet whom I have mentioned was flung into the
sea by his shipmates one and all, but I am granted the consolation of
your holiness, and of other godly men. For them <span id="page_299">p.
299</span> <span id="iv.x.cxxiv-Page_299"></span>and for your godliness
I pray that the blessing bestowed upon the excellent Onesiphorus may be
yours, for you have not blushed at my gibes; nay rather you have shared
in my afflictions for the faith’s sake.

<span id="iv.x.cxxiv-p5"></span>And one thing which I wish you to know
is that, though other godly bishops have sent me their bounty, I have
declined to receive it;—not from any want of respect to the senders, God
forbid;—but because hitherto food convenient for me has been provided by
Him Who gives it even to the ravens without stint. In the case of your
reverence I have acted differently, for really the warmth of your
affection has overcome what has hitherto been my fixed principle. For be
well assured, my godly friend, that ever since friendship grew up
between us the fire of our love has been kindled to greater heat.
