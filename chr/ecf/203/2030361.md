<span id="iv.x.clxxii-p1"></span> *CLXXI. Letter of Theodoret to John,
Bishop of Antioch, after the Reconciliation.* <span
id="fr_2295"></span>[2296](#fn_2295)

<span id="iv.x.clxxii-p4"></span>God, who governs all things in wisdom,
who provides for our unanimity, and cares for the salvation of His
people, has caused us to be assembled together, and has shewn us that
the views of all of us are in agreement with one another. We have
assembled together, and read the Egyptian Letter; <span
id="fr_2296"></span>[2297](#fn_2296) we have carefully examined its
purport, and we have discovered that its contents are quite in
accordance with our own statements, and entirely opposed to the Twelve
Chapters, against which up to the present time we have continued to wage
war, as being contrary to true religion. Their teaching was that God the
Word was carnally made flesh; that there was an union of hypostasis, and
that the combination in union was of nature, and that God the Word was
the first-born from the dead. They forbade all distinction in the terms
used of our Lord, and further contained other doctrines at variance with
the seeds sown by the apostles, and outcome of heretical tares. The
present script, however, is beautified by apostolic nobility of origin.
For in it our Lord Jesus Christ is exhibited as perfect God and perfect
man; it shews two natures, and the distinction between them; an
unconfounded union, made not by mixture and compounding, but in a manner
ineffable and divine, and distinctly preserving the properties of the
natures; the impassibility and immortality of God the Word; the
passibility and temporary surrender to death of the temple, and its
resurrection by the power of the united God; that the holy Spirit is not
of the Son, nor derives existence from the Son, but proceeds from the
Father, and is properly stated to be of the Son, as being of one
substance. <span id="fr_2297"></span>[2298](#fn_2297) Beholding this
orthodoxy in the letter, we have hymned Him who heals our stammering
tongues, and changes our discordant noises into the harmony of sweet
music. <span id="fr_2298"></span>[2299](#fn_2298)

<span id="fn_2295"></span>[344:2296](2030361.htm#fr_2295) <span
id="iv.x.clxxii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.x.clxxii-p2"></span> This Letter appears to be that of the
Euphratensian synod. (“*probat prmum hæc vox* <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.x.clxxii-p2.1"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.x.clxxii-p2.2"></span>ν κοινῷ</span>, *in conventu: deinde
pluralis numerus ubique positus.*” Garnerius.)

<span id="iv.x.clxxii-p3"></span>Garnerius would date it during the
negotiations for reconciliation, when John of Antioch visited Acacius at
Berœa, after the Orientals had accepted Cyril’s formula of faith.
Schulze would rather place it after the negotiations were over.

id="iv.x.clxxii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="iv.x.clxxii-p5"></span> Presumably the letter written by Cyril
to Acacius, setting forth his own view, and representing that peace
might be attained if the Orientals would give up Nestorius. It exists in
Latin. Synod. Mansi, V. 831.

<span id="iv.x.clxxii-p7"></span> The following paragraph, found only in
the Vatican <span class="c14"><span

“inept,” is omitted. It has no significance.
