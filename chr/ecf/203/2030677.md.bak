<span id="vi.xi.ii.xl"></span>

<span id="vi.xi.ii.xl-p1"></span> 38. <span
id="fr_2887"></span>[2888](#fn_2887.md) Now, as to the expression which he
uses, “Some persons say,” I think it has been made clear by what I have
previously said, that, when he says “some persons say” or “Another
says,” and does not controvert the opinions which are thus introduced,
it is he himself who is this ‘certain’ or ‘other’ person. And this is
proved by the numerous cases which I have pointed out in which he
expresses opinions agreeing with these without the introduction of any
such person. We must consider therefore in each case whether he
expresses any dissent from the ‘other.’ For instance, an opinion is put
forward that the stars and the other things that are in heaven are
reasonable beings and capable of sinning. We must see, therefore, what
his own opinion is on this point. Turn to his note, in this book, <span
id="fr_2888"></span>[2889](#fn_2888.md) upon the passage “He must reign
till he hath put all his enemies under his feet.” <span
id="fr_2889"></span>[2890](#fn_2889.md) You will find, some way down, the
words:

<span id="vi.xi.ii.xl-p5"></span>“It may be observed that no one is
without sin, that Even the stars are not clean in his sight, <span
id="fr_2890"></span>[2891](#fn_2890.md) and Every creature trembles at the
coming of the Creator. Hence it is not only things on earth but also
things in heaven which are said to have been cleansed by our Saviour’s
cross.”

<span id="vi.xi.ii.xl-p7"></span>Again, as to the opinion that it is
because of their being in this body of humiliation or body of death that
men are called children of wrath, he says, in commenting on the
words <span id="fr_2891"></span>[2892](#fn_2891.md) ‘We were the children
of wrath, even as others.’ (Comm. on Ephes. on this verse, some way
down.)

<span id="vi.xi.ii.xl-p9"></span>“We must hold that men are by nature
children of wrath because of this <span
id="fr_2892"></span>[2893](#fn_2892.md) ‘body of humiliation’ and <span
id="fr_2893"></span>[2894](#fn_2893.md) ‘body of death,’ and because <span
id="fr_2894"></span>[2895](#fn_2894.md) ‘the heart of man is disposed to
evil from his youth.’”

<span id="vi.xi.ii.xl-p13"></span>Again, on the opinion that there is
first a creation of the soul and afterwards a fashioning of the body he
says (at the same passage, a long way down)

<span id="vi.xi.ii.xl-p14"></span>“And observe carefully that he does
not say, ‘We are his forming and fashioning, but <span
id="fr_2895"></span>[2896](#fn_2895.md) ‘We are his making.’ For
‘fashioning’ implies the fact of man’s origin from the slime of the
earth: but ‘making’ from his origin according to the image and
similitude of God. And this distinction is confirmed by the words of the
118th Psalm <span id="fr_2896"></span>[2897](#fn_2896.md) “Thy hands have
made me and fashioned me.” ‘Making’ has the first place, ‘fashioning’
comes after.’

<span id="vi.xi.ii.xl-p17"></span>Are there any other things which he
wishes us to condemn? He has only to mention them, and we can draw them
out from his own books, or rather from the bottom of his own heart. For
instance. We are to condemn as a pestilent assertion that the nature of
human souls and of angels is the same. But let us see what his own
opinion is on this point as given in the books which he specially puts
before us as containing the pattern of his profession and his rule of
faith. Turn to the passage, <span id="fr_2897"></span>[2898](#fn_2897.md)
“He came and preached peace to them which were afar off and to them that
were nigh.” His comment on this first expounds the words of Jews and
Gentiles, and then goes on:

<span id="vi.xi.ii.xl-p19"></span>“This has been said in accordance with
the Vulgate <span id="fr_2898"></span>[2899](#fn_2898.md) translation. But,
if a man reads the words of the Apostle when he says of Christ, <span
id="fr_2899"></span>[2900](#fn_2899.md) “Making peace through the blood of
his cross for those that are in earth and for those that are in heaven”
and the rest that is said in that place, he will not consider that it is
we who are called the spiritual Israel are intended by ‘those afar off,’
and that the Jews, who are merely called ‘Israel after the flesh’ are
‘those who are nigh.’ He will modify the whole meaning of the passage,
and apply it to the angels and the heavenly powers and to human souls,
and as implying that Christ by his blood joined together things in earth
and things in heaven which before were at variance, who brought back the
sheep which had grown sickly upon the mountains to be with the rest, and
put back the last piece of money among those which had before been
safe.”
