<span id="vi.xiii.xxxiii-p1"></span> 32. To sit at the right hand of the
Father is a mystery belonging to the Incarnation. For it does not befit
that incorporeal nature without the assumption of flesh; neither is the
excellency of a heavenly seat sought for the divine nature, but for the
human. Whence it is said of Him, “Thy seat, O God, is prepared from
thence forward; Thou art from everlasting.” <span
id="fr_3380"></span>[3381](#fn_3380) The seat, then, whereon the Lord
Jesus was to sit, was prepared from everlasting, “in whose name every
knee should bow, of things in heaven and things on earth, and things
under the earth; and every tongue shall confess to Him that Jesus is
Lord in the glory of God the Father;” <span
id="fr_3381"></span>[3382](#fn_3381) of Whom also David thus speaks,
“The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit Thou on my right hand until I make
Thine enemies Thy footstool.” <span id="fr_3382"></span>[3383](#fn_3382)
Referring to which words the Lord in the Gospel said to the Pharisees,
“If therefore <span id="page_556">p. 556</span> <span
id="vi.xiii.xxxiii-Page_556"></span>David in spirit calleth Him Lord,
how is He his Son?” <span id="fr_3383"></span>[3384](#fn_3383) By which
He shewed that according to the Spirit He was the Lord, according to the
flesh He was the Son, of David. Whence also the Lord Himself says in
another place, “Verily I say unto you, henceforth ye shall see the Son
of Man sitting at the right hand of the power of God.” <span
id="fr_3384"></span>[3385](#fn_3384) And the Apostle Peter says of
Christ, “Who is on the right hand of God, seated in the heavens.” <span
id="fr_3385"></span>[3386](#fn_3385) And Paul also, writing to the
Ephesians, “According to the working of the might of His power, which He
wrought in Christ, when He raised Him from the dead, and seated Him on
His right hand.” <span id="fr_3386"></span>[3387](#fn_3386)
