<span id="iv.x.xci-p1"></span> *XCI. To the Prefect Eutrechius.* <span
id="fr_1800"></span>[1801](#fn_1800)

<span id="iv.x.xci-p3"></span>I well know, and need no words to tell me,
how your excellency regards me. Actions speak more clearly than words,
but I have been anxious for you to know the cause of the accusation that
is brought against me. For I am suffering under a most extraordinary
charge, being at one and the same time attacked as unmarried, and as
having been married twice. <span id="fr_1801"></span>[1802](#fn_1801) If
my present calumniators assert that I am falsifying the apostolic
doctrine, why in the world, instead of accusing me in my absence, do
they not attempt to convict me face to face? This fact alone is enough
to give utter refutation to their lies, for it is because they know that
I have innumerable witnesses to the apostolic character of my doctrines
that they have urged an undefended indictment against me. Lawful judges
must on the contrary keep one ear unbiassed for the accused. If they
give both to the pleadings of the opponents, and deliver a sentence
acceptable to them, I shall put up with the injustice as bringing me
nearer to the kingdom of heaven, and shall await that impartial
tribunal, where there is neither prosecutor, nor counsel, nor witness,
nor distinction in rank, but judgment of deeds and words and righteous
retribution. “For,” it is said, “we must all appear before the judgment
seat of Christ that every one may receive the things done in his body
according to that he hath done whether it be good or bad.” <span

description of the inconsistency of the charges, for there was no
question of Theodoret’s being a “digamos.”
