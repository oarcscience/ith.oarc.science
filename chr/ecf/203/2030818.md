<span id="vi.xii.iii.xvi-p1"></span> 15. What your opinions are on the
resurrection of the flesh, we have already learned from your Apology.
“No member will be cut off, nor any part of the body destroyed.” This is
the clear and open profession which you make in your innocence, and
which you say is accepted by all the bishops of Italy. I should believe
your statement, but that the matter of that book which is not Pamphilus’
makes me doubt about you. And I wonder that Italy should have approved
what Rome rejected; that the bishops should have accepted what the
Apostolic see condemned.

[Next: You rashly say that you will agree to whatever Theophilus lays
down. You have to consider your friendship for Isidore now his
enemy.](2030819)
