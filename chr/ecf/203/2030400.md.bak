id="v.iii.xix-p2.1"></span>Polycarp <span
id="fr_2408"></span>[2409](#fn_2408.md) </span> disciple of the apostle
John and by him ordained bishop of Smyrna was chief of all Asia, where
he saw and had as teachers some of the apostles and of those who had
seen the Lord. He, on account of certain questions concerning the day of
the Passover, went to Rome in the time of the emperor Antoninus Pius
while Anicetus ruled the church in that city. There he led back to the
faith many of the believers who had been deceived through the persuasion
of Marcion and Valentinus, and when Marcion met him by chance and said
“Do you know us” he replied, “I know the firstborn of the devil.”
Afterwards during the reign of Marcus Antoninus and Lucius Aurelius
Commodus in the fourth persecution after Nero, in the presence of the
proconsul holding court at Smyrna and all the people crying out against
him in the Amphitheater, he was burned. He wrote a very valuable
*Epistle to the Philippians* which is read to the present day in the
meetings in Asia.
