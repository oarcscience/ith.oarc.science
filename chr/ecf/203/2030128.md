<span id="iv.viii.iv.xxii-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.iv.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXII</span>.—*How Flavianus and
Diodorus gathered the church of the orthodox in Antioch*. <span
id="fr_762"></span>[763](#fn_762.md)

<span id="iv.viii.iv.xxii-p3"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.iv.xxii-p3.1"></span>Now</span> Flavianus and Diodorus, like
break-waters, broke the force of the advancing waves. Meletius their
shepherd had been constrained to sojourn far away. But these looked
after the flock, opposing their own courage and cunning to the wolves,
and bestowing due care upon the sheep. Now that they were driven away
from under the cliff they fed their flocks by the banks of the
neighbouring river. They could not brook, like the captives at Babylon,
to hang their <span id="page_127">p. 127</span> <span
id="iv.viii.iv.xxii-Page_127"></span>harps upon the willows, <span
id="fr_763"></span>[764](#fn_763.md) but they continued to hymn their maker
and benefactor in all places of his dominion. <span
id="fr_764"></span>[765](#fn_764.md) But not even in this spot was the
meeting of the pious pastors of them that blessed the Lord suffered by
the foe to be assembled. So again this pair of excellent shepherds
gathered their sheep in the soldiers training ground and there tried to
show them their spiritual food in secret. Diodorus, in his wisdom and
courage, like a clear and mighty river, watered his own and drowned the
blasphemies of his opponents, thinking nothing of the splendour of his
birth, and gladly undergoing the sufferings of the faith.

<span id="iv.viii.iv.xxii-p6"></span>The excellent Flavianus, who was
also of the highest rank, thought piety the only nobility, <span
id="fr_765"></span>[766](#fn_765.md) and, like some trainer for the games,
anointed the great Diodorus <span id="fr_766"></span>[767](#fn_766.md) as
though he had been an athlete for five contests. <span
id="fr_767"></span>[768](#fn_767.md)

<span id="iv.viii.iv.xxii-p11"></span>At that time he did not himself
preach at the services of the church, but furnished an abundant supply
of arguments and scriptural thoughts to preachers, who were thus able to
aim their shafts at the blasphemy of Arius, while he as it were handed
them the arrows of his intelligence from a quiver. Discoursing alike at
home and abroad he easily rent asunder the heretics nets and showed
their defences to be mere spiders webs. He was aided in these contests
by that Aphraates whose life I have written in my Religious
History, <span id="fr_768"></span>[769](#fn_768.md) and who, preferring the
welfare of the sheep to his own rest, abandoned his cell of discipline
and retirement, and undertook the hard toil of a shepherd. Having
written on these matters in another work I deem it now superfluous to
recount the wealth of virtue which he amassed, but one specimen of his
good deeds I will proceed now to relate, as specially appropriate to
this history.

Chrysost. (Laus Diodori §4. tom. iii. p. 749) describes how the whole
city assembled and were fed by his tongue flowing with milk and honey,
themselves meanwhile supplying his necessities with their gifts. Valens
retorted with redoubled violence, and anticipated the “noyades” of
Carrier at Lyons. cf. Socrates iv. 17 and Dict. Christ. Biog. ii. 529.
