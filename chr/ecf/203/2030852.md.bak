<span id="vi.xiii.iv-p1"></span> 3. I <span class="c14"><span
id="vi.xiii.iv-p1.1"></span>Believe in God the Father Almighty</span>.

<span id="vi.xiii.iv-p2"></span>But before I begin to discuss the
meaning of the words, I think it well to mention that in different
Churches some additions are found in this article. This is not the case,
however, in the Church of the city of Rome; the reason being, as I
suppose, that, on the one hand, no heresy has had its origin there, and,
on the other, that the ancient custom is there kept up, that those who
are going to be baptized should rehearse the Creed publicly, that is, in
the audience of the people; the consequence of which is that the ears of
those who are already believers will not admit the addition of a single
word. But in other places, as I understand, additions appear to have
been made, on account of certain heretics, by means of which it was
hoped that novelty in doctrine would be excluded. We, however, follow
that order which we received when we were baptized in the Church of
Aquileia.

<span id="vi.xiii.iv-p3"></span>I <span class="c14"><span
id="vi.xiii.iv-p3.1"></span>Believe</span>, therefore, is placed in the
forefront, as the Apostle Paul, writing to the Hebrews, says, “He that
cometh to God must first of all believe that He is, and that He is a
rewarder of those who believe on Him.” <span
id="fr_3256"></span>[3257](#fn_3256.md) The Prophet also says, “Except ye
believe, <span id="fr_3257"></span>[3258](#fn_3257.md) ye shall not
understand.” That the way to understand, therefore, may be open to you,
you do rightly first of all, in professing that you believe; for no one
embarks upon the sea, and trusts himself to the deep and liquid element,
unless he first believes it possible that he will have a safe voyage;
neither does the husbandman commit his seed to the furrows and scatter
his grain on the earth, but in the belief that the showers will come,
together with the sun’s warmth, through whose fostering influence, aided
by favouring winds, the earth will produce and multiply and ripen its
fruits. In fine, nothing in life can be transacted if there be not first
a readiness to believe. What wonder then, if, coming to God, we first of
all profess that we believe, seeing that, without this, not even common
life can be lived. We have premised these remarks at the outset, since
the Pagans are wont to object to us that our religion, because it lacks
reasons, rests solely on belief. We have shewn, therefore, that nothing
can possibly be done or remain stable unless belief precede. Finally,
marriages are contracted in the belief that children will be born; and
children are committed to the care of masters in the belief that the
teaching of the masters will be transferred to the pupils; and one man
assumes the ensigns of empire, believing that peoples and cities and a
well-equipped army also will obey him. But if no one enters upon any one
of these several undertakings except in the belief that the results
spoken of will follow, must not belief be much more requisite if one
would come to the knowledge of God? But let us see what this “short
word” of the Creed sets forth.
