<span id="vi.xi.iii.ix"></span>

<span id="vi.xi.iii.ix-p1"></span> 8. Take the treatise which <span
id="fr_2943"></span>[2944](#fn_2943.md) he entitles “On the best mode of
translating,” though there is nothing in it except the addition of the
title which is of the best, for all is of the worst; and in which he
proves those to be heretics with whom he is now in communion, thus
incurring the condemnation of our Apostle (not his, for those whom he
calls ‘his’ are Flaccus and Tully) who says, “He who judges <span
id="fr_2944"></span>[2945](#fn_2944.md) is condemned if he eat.” In that
treatise, which tells us that no works of any kind reasonably admit of a
rendering word for word (though he has come round now to think such
rendering reasonable) <span id="fr_2945"></span>[2946](#fn_2945.md) he
inserts whole passages from a work of Cicero. <span
id="fr_2946"></span>[2947](#fn_2946.md) But had he not said, “What has
Horace to do with the Psalter, or Maro with the Gospels, or Cicero with
the Apostle? Will not your brother be offended if he sees you sitting in
that idol temple?” Here of course he brings himself in guilty of
idolatry; for if reading causes offence, much more does writing. But,
since one who turns to idolatry does not thereby become wholly and
completely a heathen unless he first denies Christ, he tells us that he
said to Christ, as he sat on the judgment seat with his most exalted
angel ministers around him, “If I ever hereafter read or possess any
heathen books, I have denied thee,” and now he not only reads them and
possesses them, not only copies them and collates them, but inserts them
among the words of Scripture itself, and in discourses intended for the
edification of the Church. What I say is well enough known to all who
read his treatises, and requires no proof. But it is just like a man who
is trying to save himself from such a gulf of sacrilege and perjury, to
make up some excuse for himself, and to say, as he does: “I do not now
read them, I have a tenacious memory, so that I can quote various
passages from different writers without a break, and I now merely quote
what I learned in my youth.” Well: if some one were to ask me to prove
that before the sun rose this morning there was night over the earth, or
that at sunset the sun had been shining all day, I should answer that,
if a man doubted about what all men knew, it was his business to shew
cause for his doubts, not for me to shew cause for my certainty. Still
in this instance, where a man’s soul is at stake, and the crime of
perjury and of impious denial of Christ is alleged, a condemnation must
not be thought to be a thing of course, even though the facts are known
and understood by all men. We are not to imitate him who condemns the
accused before they have undergone any examination; and not only without
a hearing, but without summoning them to appear; and not only
unsummoned, but when they are already <span id="page_464">p. 464</span>
<span id="vi.xi.iii.ix-Page_464"></span>dead; and not only the dead, but
those whom he had always praised, till then; and not only those whom he
had praised, but whom he had followed and had taken as his masters. We
must fear the judgment of the Lord, who says <span
id="fr_2947"></span>[2948](#fn_2947.md) “Judge not and ye shall not be
judged,” and again, “With what measure ye mete it shall be measured to
you again.” Therefore, though it is really superfluous, I will bring
against him a single witness, but one who must prevail, and whom he
cannot challenge, that is, once more, himself and his own writings. All
can attest what I say in reference to this treatise of his; and my
assertion about it seems to be superfluous; but I must make use of some
special testimony, lest what I say should seem unsatisfactory to those
who have not read his works.
