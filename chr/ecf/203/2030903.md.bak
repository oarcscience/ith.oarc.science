<span id="vi.xix-p3"></span>————————————

<span id="vi.xix-p4"></span>A satisfactory conclusion has now, I trust,
been reached of the Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans, the writing
of which has been a work of very great labour and time. I confess, my
most loving brother Heraclius, that in the attempt to respond to your
request I have almost forgotten the precept; “Do not lift a burden above
your strength.” Even in the other translations of Origen’s works into
Latin, which were made because you earnestly requested it, or rather
exacted it as a journeyman’s task, the labour was very great; for I made
it my object to supplement what Origen spoke extempore in the lecture
room of the church; for his aim there was the application of the subject
for the sake of edification rather than the exposition of the text. This
I have done in the case of the Homilies, and the short lectures on
Genesis and Exodus, and especially in those on the book of Leviticus,
where he spoke in a hortatory manner, whereas my translation takes the
form of an exposition. This duty of supplying what was wanted I took up
because I thought that the practice of agitating questions and then
leaving them unsolved, which he frequently adopts in his homiletic mode
of speaking, might prove distasteful to the Latin reader. The works upon
Jesus Nave <span id="fr_3443"></span>[3444](#fn_3443.md) and the book of
Judges and the thirty-sixth, thirty-seventh and thirty-eighth Psalms, I
translated simply as I found them, with no great labour. While then in
the other cases which I have mentioned above, I employed much labour in
supplying what Origen had omitted, in this work on the Epistle to the
Romans the labour that fell on me for the causes described in the
Preface was immense and full of complexity. But there will have been
nothing but pleasure in these labours, provided only that my experience
in other cases, of ill-disposed minds requiting my toils and vigils with
contumely, be not repeated and that I do not gain for my studies the
reward of detraction and for my labour a conspiracy to ruin me. For in
dealing with these men I have to undergo a new form of accusation. They
say to me; When you write these things, in which are found many pieces
the composition of which is due to yourself, you should place your own
name in the title, and let it run thus: ‘The books of Rufinus’
commentary on (for instance) the Epistle to the Romans;’ for so, they
say, in the case of profane writers, the name in the title is not that
of the Greek author who is translated but of the Latin author who
translates him. But all this complaisance, by which the works are
ascribed to me, is caused not by love to me but by hatred to the author.
I am much more observant of my conscience than of my reputation; it may
be apparent that I have added some things to supply what was wanting;
and that I have abbreviated what was too lengthy; but to steal the title
from the man who laid the foundations on which the building has been
reared is what I cannot think right. It must be, I grant, in the
discretion of the reader, when he has examined the work, to ascribe the
work to any one he thinks right; but my intention has been not to seek
the applause of students but the good of those who wish to be edified.

<span id="vi.xix-p6"></span>I shall turn next to the work which was long
ago imposed upon me but now is demanded with still greater vehemence by
the Bishop Gaudentius, namely to turn into Latin the books called the
Recognition of Clement the Bishop of Rome, the successor <span
id="page_568">p. 568</span> <span id="vi.xix-Page_568"></span>and
companion of the Apostles. In this work I well know that, to judge by
the ordinary rule, I shall have labour upon labour. In this case I will
do what my friends desire, I will put my own name in the title of the
work, though I shall have that of the author also. It shall be called
Rufinus’s Clement. If the Lord enable me to fulfil this task, I shall
afterwards return to that which you desire, and say something, God
willing, on the books of Numbers or of Deuteronomy (for this alone is
wanting to my whole work on the Heptateuch): or else I shall write what
I can, the Lord being my guide, on the remaining epistles of the Apostle
Paul.
