<span id="vi.xii.i.xxxii-p1"></span> 31. I might well reply as I have
done even if it were a question of a promise made with full
consciousness. But this is a new and shameless thing; he throws in my
teeth a mere dream. How am I to answer? I have no time for thinking of
anything outside my own sphere. I wish that I were not prevented from
reading even the Holy Scriptures by the throngs that beset this place,
and the gathering of Christians from all parts of the world. Still, when
a man makes a dream into a crime, I can quote to him the words of the
Prophets, who say that we are not to believe dreams; for even to dream
of adultery does not condemn us to hell, and to dream of the crown of
martyrdom does not raise us to heaven. Often I have seen myself in
dreams dead and placed in the grave: often I have flown over the earth
and been carried as if swimming through the air, over mountains and
seas. My accuser might, therefore, demand that I should cease to live,
or that I should have wings on my shoulders, because my mind has often
been mocked in sleep by vague fancies of this kind. How many people are
rich while asleep and wake to find themselves beggars! or are drinking
water to cool their thirst, and wake up with their throats parched and
burning! You exact from me the fulfilment of a promise given in a dream.
I will meet you with a truer and closer question: Have you done all that
you promised in your baptism? Have you or I fulfilled all that the
profession of a monk demands? I beg you, think whether you are not
looking at the mote in my eye through the beam in your own. I say this
against my will; it is by sorrow that my reluctant tongue is forced into
words. As to you, it is not enough for you to make up charges about my
waking deeds, but you must accuse me for my dreams. You have such an
interest in my actions that you must discuss what I have said or done in
my sleep. I will not dwell on the way in which, in your zeal to speak
against me, you have besmirched your own profession, and have done all
you can by word and deed for the dishonouring of the whole body of
Christians. But I give you fair warning, and will repeat it again and
again. You are attacking a creature who has horns: and, if it were not
that I lay to heart the words of the Apostle <span
id="fr_3068"></span>[3069](#fn_3068.md) “The evil speakers <span
id="fr_3069"></span>[3070](#fn_3069.md) shall not inherit the kingdom of
God,” and <span id="fr_3070"></span>[3071](#fn_3070.md) “By hating one
another you have been consumed one of another,” I would make you feel
what a vast discord you have stirred up after a slight and pretended
reconciliation. What advantage is it to you to heap up slanders against
me both among friends and strangers? Is it because I am not an
Origenist, and do not believe that I sinned in heaven, that I am accused
as a sinner upon earth? And was the result of our renewal of friendship
to be, that I was not to speak against heretics for fear that my notice
of them should be taken for an assault upon you? So long as I did not
refuse to be belauded by you, you followed me as a master, you called me
friend and brother, and acknowledged me as a catholic in every respect.
But when I asked to be spared your praises, and judged myself unworthy
to have such a great man for my trumpeter, you immediately ran your pen
through what you had written, and began to abuse all that you had
praised <span id="page_500">p. 500</span> <span
id="vi.xii.i.xxxii-Page_500"></span>before, and to pour forth from the
same mouth both sweet and bitter words. I wish you could understand what
self-repression I am exerting in not suiting my words to the boiling
heat of my breast; and how I pray, like the Psalmist: <span
id="fr_3071"></span>[3072](#fn_3071.md) “Set a watch, O Lord, before my
mouth, keep the door of my lips. Incline not my heart to the words of
malice;” and, as he says elsewhere: <span
id="fr_3072"></span>[3073](#fn_3072.md) “While the wicked stood before me I
was dumb and was humbled and kept silence even from good words;” and
again: <span id="fr_3073"></span>[3074](#fn_3073.md) “I became as a man
that heareth not and in whose mouth are no reproofs.” But for me the
Lord the Avenger will reply, as he says through the Prophet: <span
id="fr_3074"></span>[3075](#fn_3074.md) “Vengeance is mine, I will repay,
saith the Lord”: and in another place: <span
id="fr_3075"></span>[3076](#fn_3075.md) “Thou satest and spakest against
thy brother, and hast slandered thy mother’s son. These things hast thou
done, and I kept silence; thou thoughtest indeed by that I should be
such an one as thyself; but I will reprove thee, and set them before
thine eyes;” so that you may see yourself brought in guilty of those
things which you falsely lay to another’s charge.
