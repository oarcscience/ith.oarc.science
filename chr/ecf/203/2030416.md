id="fr_2434"></span>[2435](#fn_2434.md) </span> of Mesopotamia is reckoned
among the distinguished men. He was at first a follower of Valentinus
and afterwards his opponent and himself founded a new heresy. He has the
reputation among the Syrians of having been a brilliant genius and
vehement in argument. He wrote a multitude of works against almost all
heresies which had come into existence in his time. Among these a most
remarkable and strong work is the one which he addressed to Marcus
Antoninus *On fate,* and many other volumes *On persecution* which his
followers translated from the Syriac language into Greek. If indeed so
much force and brilliancy appears in the translation, how great it must
have been in the original.
