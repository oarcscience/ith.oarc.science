<span id="iv.x.xxxix-p1"></span> *XXXIX. Festal.*

<span id="iv.x.xxxix-p2"></span>My wish was to write in cheerful terms
and sound the note of the spiritual joy of the feast, but I am prevented
by the multitude of our sins, which are bringing on us the judgment of
God. For who indeed can be so insensible as not to perceive the divine
wrath? May your piety then pray that affairs may undergo a change for
the better; that so we too may change the style of our letter, and write
words of cheerfulness instead of those of wailing.
