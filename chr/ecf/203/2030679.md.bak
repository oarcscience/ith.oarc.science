<span id="vi.xi.ii.xlii"></span>

<span id="vi.xi.ii.xlii-p1"></span> 40. There are one or two more things
on which he wishes condemnation to be passed. One is this: that these
men say that the body is a prison, and like a chain round the soul; and
that they assert that the soul does not depart, but returns to the place
where it <span id="page_457">p. 457</span> <span
id="vi.xi.ii.xlii-Page_457"></span>originally was. Let me give
quotations to show his opinion on this point also. In the second book of
these Commentaries, on the passage “For this cause, I, Paul, the
prisoner of Jesus Christ,” he says, a little way down;

<span id="vi.xi.ii.xlii-p2"></span>“The Apostle in several passages
calls the body the chain of the soul, because the soul is kept shut up
as it were in a prison; and thus we may speak of Paul being kept close
in the bonds of the body and does not return to be with Christ, so that
preaching to the Gentiles may be perfectly accomplished.”

<span id="vi.xi.ii.xlii-p3"></span>And again in the third book of these
Commentaries, on the words, “for which I am an ambassador in
chains,” <span id="fr_2903"></span>[2904](#fn_2903.md) after some
discussion of the passage, he speaks in the character of that ‘other’
which is himself:

<span id="vi.xi.ii.xlii-p5"></span>“Another contends that he speaks thus
because of the <span id="fr_2904"></span>[2905](#fn_2904.md) body of our
humiliation and the chain with which we are encompassed, so that
we <span id="fr_2905"></span>[2906](#fn_2905.md) know not yet as we ought
to know, and see <span id="fr_2906"></span>[2907](#fn_2906.md) by means of
a mirror in a riddle: and that he will be able to disclose the mysteries
of the Gospel only when he has cast off this chain and gone forth free
from his prison. Yet perhaps even in chains that man may be considered
as free who has his conversation in heaven, and of whom it may be
said: <span id="fr_2907"></span>[2908](#fn_2907.md) “You are not in the
prison nor in the flesh, but in the spirit, if so be that the spirit of
God dwelleth in you.”

<span id="vi.xi.ii.xlii-p10"></span>And in the Commentary on Paul’s
Epistle to Philemon, at the place where he says <span
id="fr_2908"></span>[2909](#fn_2908.md) “Epaphras my fellow-prisoner
greeteth you,” some way down he says:

<span id="vi.xi.ii.xlii-p12"></span>“Possibly, however, as some think, a
more recondite and mysterious view is set before us, namely, that the
two companions had been captured and bound and brought down into this
vale of tears.”
