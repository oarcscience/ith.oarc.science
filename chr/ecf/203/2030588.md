<span id="v.iv.lxix-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="v.iv.lxix-p2.1"></span>Salvianus, <span
id="fr_2686"></span>[2687](#fn_2686.md) </span> presbyter of Marseilles,
well informed both in secular and in sacred literature, and to speak
without invidiousness, a master among bishops, wrote many things in a
scholastic and clear style, of which I have read the following: four
books *On the Excellence of virginity,* to Marcellus the presbyter,
three books *Against avarice,* five books *On the present
judgment,* <span id="fr_2687"></span>[2688](#fn_2687.md) and one book *On
punishment according to desert,* addressed to Salonius the bishop, also
one book of *Commentary on* the latter part of the book of
*Ecclesiastes,* addressed to Claudius bishop of Vienne, one book of
*Epistles.* <span id="fr_2688"></span>[2689](#fn_2688.md) He also composed
one book in verse after the Greek fashion, a sort of *Hexaemeron,*
covering the period from the beginning of Genesis to the creation of
man, also many *Homilies* delivered to the bishops, and I am sure I do
not know how many *On the sacraments.* He is still living at a good old
age.
