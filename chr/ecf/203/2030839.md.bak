<span id="vi.xii.iii.xxxvii-p1"></span> 36. In the matter of the books
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xii.iii.xxxvii-p1.1"></span>Περὶ
᾽Αρχῶν</span>, I have even a claim upon your gratitude. You say that you
cut off anything that was offensive and replaced it by what was better.
I have represented things just as they stood in the Greek. By this means
both things are made to appear, your faith and the heresy of him whom
you translated. The leading Christians of Rome wrote to me: Answer your
accuser; if you keep silence, you will be held to have assented to his
charges. All of them unanimously demanded that I should bring to light
the subtle errors of Origen, and make known the poison of the heretics
to the ears of the Romans to put them on their guard. How can this be an
injury to you? Have you a monopoly of the translation of these books?
Are there no others who take part in this work? When you translated
parts of the Septuagint, did you mean to prohibit all others from
translating it after your version had been published? Why, I also have
translated many books from the Greek. You have full power to make a
second translation of them at your pleasure; for both the good and the
bad in them must be laid to the charge of their author. And this would
hold in your case also, had you not said that you had cut out the
heretical parts and translated only what was positively good. This is a
<span id="page_537">p. 537</span> <span
id="vi.xii.iii.xxxvii-Page_537"></span>difficulty which you have made
for yourself, and which cannot be solved, except by confessing that you
have erred as all men err, and condemning your former opinion.
