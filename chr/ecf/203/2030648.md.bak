<span id="vi.xi.ii.xi-p1"></span> 10. But in this, he says, I convict
you, that you have translated the work of Origen, in which he says that
there is to be a restitution of all things, in which we must believe
that not only sinners but the devil himself and his angels will at last
be relieved from their punishment, if we are to set before our minds in
a consistent manner what is meant by the restitution of all things. And
Origen, he says, teaches further that souls have been made before their
bodies, and have been brought down from heaven and inserted into their
bodies. I am not now acting on Origen’s behalf, nor writing an apology
for him. Whether he stands accepted before God or has been cast away is
not mine to judge: to his own lord he stands or falls. <span
id="fr_2836"></span>[2837](#fn_2836.md) But I am compelled to make mention
of him in a few words, since our great rhetorician, though seeming to be
arguing against him is really striking at me; and this he does no longer
indirectly, but ends by openly attacking me with his sword drawn and
turns his whole fury against me. I say too little in saying that he
attacks me; for indeed, in order to vent his rage against me, he does
not even spare his old teacher: <span
id="fr_2837"></span>[2838](#fn_2837.md) he thinks that in the books which I
have translated he can find something which may enable him to hurl his
calumnies against me. In addition to other things which he finds to
blame in me he adds this invidious remark, that I have chosen for
translation a work which neither he nor any of the older translators had
chosen. I will begin, therefore, since it is here that I am chiefly
attacked, by stating how it came to pass that I attempted the
translation of this work in preference to any other, and I will do so in
the fewest and truest words. This is, no doubt, superfluous for you, my
well-beloved son, since you know the whole affair as it occurred; yet it
is desirable that those who are ignorant of it should know the truth:
besides, both he and all his followers make this a triumphant accusation
against me, that I promised in my Preface to adopt one method of
translation but adopted a different one in the work itself. Hence, I
will make an answer which will serve not only for them, but for many
besides whose judgment is perverted either by their own malice or by the
accusations which others make against me.

that Jerome owed and cared more for Origen than he chose to avow.
