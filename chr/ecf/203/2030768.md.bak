<span id="vi.xii.i.xxx"></span>

<span id="vi.xii.i.xxx-p1"></span> 29. The simple explanation of my own
opinion in reference to the passage I stated before in these words:

<span id="vi.xii.i.xxx-p2"></span>“Taking the simple sense of the words,
we have a command, following on the precept of mutual kindness between
man and wife, that we should nourish and cherish our wives: that is,
that we should supply them with the food and clothing which are
necessary.”

<span id="vi.xii.i.xxx-p3"></span>This is my own understanding of the
passage. Consequently, my words imply that all that follows after and
might be brought up against me must be understood as spoken not as my
own view but that of my opponents. But it might be thought that my
resolution of the difficulty of the passage is too short and peremptory,
and that it wraps the true sense, according to what has been said above,
in the darkness of allegory, so as to bring it down from its true
meaning to one less true. I will therefore come nearer to the matter,
and ask what there is in the other interpretation with which you need
disagree. It is this I suppose, that I said that souls should cherish
their bodies as men cherish their wives, so that this corruptible may
put on incorruption, and that, being lightly poised as upon wings, it
may rise more easily into the air. When I say that this corruptible must
put on incorruption, I do not change the nature of the body, but give it
a higher rank in the scale of being. And so as regards what follows,
that, being lightly poised as upon wings, it may more easily rise into
the air: He who gets wings, that is, immortality, so that he may fly
more lightly up to heaven, does not cease to be what he had been. But
you may say, I am staggered by what follows:

<span id="vi.xii.i.xxx-p4"></span>“Let us men then cherish our wives,
and let our souls cherish our bodies, in such a way as that wives may be
turned into men and bodies into spirits, and that there may be no
difference of sex, but that, as among the angels there is neither male
nor female, so we, who are to be like the angels, may begin to be on
earth what it is promised that we shall be in heaven.”

<span id="vi.xii.i.xxx-p5"></span>You might justly be staggered, if I
had not, after what goes before, said “We may begin to be what it is
promised that we shall be in heaven.” When I say, “We shall begin to be
on earth,” I do not take away the difference of sex; I only take away
lust, and sexual intercourse, as the Apostle does when he says, “The
time is short; it remaineth therefore that those who have wives be as
though they had none;” and as the Lord implied when, in reply to the
question of which of the seven brothers the woman would be the wife, he
answered: <span id="fr_3054"></span>[3055](#fn_3054.md) “Ye err, not
knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God; for in the resurrection
they shall neither marry nor be given in marriage: but they shall be as
the angels of God.” And, indeed, when chastity is observed between man
and woman, it begins to be true that there is neither male nor female;
but, though living in the body, they are being changed into angels,
among whom there is neither male nor female. <span id="page_498">p.
498</span> <span id="vi.xii.i.xxx-Page_498"></span>The same is said by
the same Apostle in another place: <span
id="fr_3055"></span>[3056](#fn_3055.md) “As many of you as were baptized
into Christ did put on Christ. There can be neither Jew nor Greek, there
can be neither bond nor free, there can be no male and female: for ye
are all one in Christ Jesus.”
