He wrote from experience, and in forcible language, or to speak more clearly, with meaning back of his words, and action back of his talk. He covered the whole field of practical directions, for monks of all sorts, in the following works: <i>On dress,</i> also <i>On the canon of prayers,</i> and the <i>Usage in the saying of Psalms,</i> (for these in the Egyptian monasteries, are said day and night), three books. One of <i>Institutes,</i> eight books <i>On the origin, nature and remedies for the eight principal sins,</i> a book on each sin.
