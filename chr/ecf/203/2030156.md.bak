<span id="iv.viii.v.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.v.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVI</span>.—*Of Amphilochius,
bishop of Iconium*.

<span id="iv.viii.v.xvi-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.v.xvi-p2.1"></span>On</span> the emperor’s return the
admirable Amphilochius, whom I have often mentioned, came to beg that
the Arian congregations might be expelled from the cities. The emperor
thought the petition too severe, and refused it. The very wise
Amphilochius at the moment was silent, for he had hit upon a memorable
device. The next time he entered the Palace and beheld standing at the
emperor’s side his son Arcadius, who had lately been appointed emperor,
he saluted Theodosius as was his wont, but did no honour to Arcadius.
The emperor, thinking that this neglect was due to forgetfulness,
commanded Amphilochius to approach and to salute his son. “Sir,” said
he, “the honour which I have paid you is enough.” Theodosius was
indignant at the discourtesy, and said, “Dishonour done to my son is a
rudeness to myself.” Then, and not till then, the very wise Amphilochius
disclosed the object of his conduct, and said with a loud voice, “You
see, sir, that you do not brook dishonour done your son, and are
bitterly angry with those who are rude to him. Believe then that the God
of all the world abominates them that blaspheme the Only begotten Son,
and hates them as ungrateful to their Saviour and Benefactor.”

<span id="iv.viii.v.xvi-p3"></span>Then the emperor understood the
bishop’s drift, and admired both what he had done and what he had said.
Without further delay he put out an edict forbidding the congregations
of heretics. <span id="fr_869"></span>[870](#fn_869.md)

<span id="iv.viii.v.xvi-p5"></span>But to escape all the snares of the
common enemy of mankind is no easy task. Often it happens that one who
has kept clear of lascivious passion is fixed fast in the toils of
avarice; and if he prove superior to greed there on the other side is
the pitfall of envy, and even if he leap safe over this he will find a
net of passion waiting for him on the other side. Other innumerable
stumbling blocks the enemy sets in men’s paths, trying to catch them to
their ruin. <span id="fr_870"></span>[871](#fn_870.md)

<span id="iv.viii.v.xvi-p7"></span>Then he has at his disposal the
bodily passions to help the wiles which he lays against the soul. The
mind alone, if it keep awake, gets the better of him, frustrating the
assault of his devices by its inclination to what is Divine. Now, since
this admirable emperor had his share of human nature, <span
id="fr_871"></span>[872](#fn_871.md) and was not free from its emotions,
his righteous anger passed the bounds of moderation, and caused the
perpetration of a savage and lawless deed. I must tell this story for
the sake of those into whose hands it will fall; it does not, indeed,
only involve blame of the admirable emperor, but so redounds to his
credit as to deserve to be remembered.

<span id="iv.viii.v.xvi-p4"></span> Arcadius was declared Augustus early
in 383 (Clinton Fast. Rome, I. p. 504). Theodosius issued his edict
against the heretics in September of same year. Sozomen (7. 6) tells the
story of an anonymous old man, priest of an obscure city, simple and
unworldly; “this,” remarks Bishop Lightfoot (Dic. Christ. Biog. i. 106),
“is as unlike Amphilochius as it can possibly be.”
