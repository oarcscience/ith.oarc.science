<span id="iv.viii.v.xxxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.v.xxxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXVI</span>.—*Of the removal
of the remains of John and of the faith of Theodosius and his sisters*.

<span id="iv.viii.v.xxxvi-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.v.xxxvi-p2.1"></span>At</span> a later time the actual
remains of the great doctor were conveyed to the imperial city, and once
again the faithful crowd turning the sea as it were into land by their
close packed boats, covered the mouth of the Bosphorus towards the
Propontis with their torches. The precious possession was brought into
Constantinople by the present emperor, <span
id="fr_935"></span>[936](#fn_935.md) who received the name of his
grandfather and preserved his piety undefiled. After first gazing upon
the bier he laid his head against it, and prayed for his parents and for
pardon on them who had ignorantly sinned, for his parents had long ago
been dead, leaving him an orphan in extreme youth, but the God of his
fathers and of his forefathers permitted him not to suffer trial from
his orphanhood, but provided for his nurture in piety, protected his
empire from the assaults of sedition, and bridled rebellious hearts.
Ever mindful of these blessings he honours his benefactor with hymns of
praise. Associated with him in this divine worship are his
sisters, <span id="fr_936"></span>[937](#fn_936.md) who have maintained
virginity throughout their lives, thinking the study of the divine
oracles <span id="fr_937"></span>[938](#fn_937.md) the greatest delight,
and reckoning that riches beyond robbers’ reach are to be found in
ministering to the poor. The emperor himself was adorned by many graces,
and not least by his kindness and clemency, an unruffled calm of soul
and a faith as undefiled as it is notorious. Of this I will give an
undeniable proof.

<span id="iv.viii.v.xxxvi-p6"></span>A certain ascetic somewhat rough of
temper came to the emperor with a petition. He came several times
without attaining his object, and at last excommunicated the emperor and
left him under his ban. The faithful emperor returned to his palace, and
as it was the time for the banquet, and his <span id="page_156">p.
156</span> <span id="iv.viii.v.xxxvi-Page_156"></span>guests were
assembled, he said that he could not partake of the entertainment before
the interdict was taken off. On this account he sent the most intimate
of his suite to the bishop, beseeching him to order the imposer of the
interdict to remove it. The bishop replied that an interdict ought not
to be accepted from every one, and pronounced it not binding, but the
emperor refused to accept this remission until the imposer of it had
after much difficulty been discovered, and had restored the communion
withdrawn. So obedient was he to divine laws.

<span id="iv.viii.v.xxxvi-p7"></span>In accordance with the same
principles he ordered a complete destruction of the remains of the
idolatrous shrines, that our posterity might be saved from the sight of
even a trace of the ancient error, this being the motive which he
expressed in the edict published on the subject. Of this good seed sown
he is ever reaping the fruits, for he has the Lord of all on his side.
So when Rhoïlas, <span id="fr_938"></span>[939](#fn_938.md) Prince of the
Scythian Nomads, had crossed the Danube with a vast host and was
ravaging and plundering Thrace, and was threatening to besiege the
imperial city, and summarily seize it and deliver it to destruction, God
smote him from on high with thunderbolt and storm, burning up the
invader and destroying all his host. A similar providence was shewn,
too, in the Persian war. The Persians received information that the
Romans were occupied elsewhere, and so in violation of the treaty of
Peace, marched against their neighbours, who found none to aid them
under the attack, because, in reliance on the Peace, the emperor had
despatched his generals and his men to other wars. Then the further
march of the Persians was stayed by a very violent storm of rain and
hail; their horses refused to advance; in twenty days they had not
succeeded in advancing as many furlongs. Meanwhile the generals returned
and mustered their troops.

<span id="iv.viii.v.xxxvi-p9"></span>In the former war, too, these same
Persians, when besieging the emperor’s eponymous city, <span
id="fr_939"></span>[940](#fn_939.md) were providentially rendered
ridiculous. For after Vararanes <span id="fr_940"></span>[941](#fn_940.md)
had beset the aforesaid city for more than thirty days with all his
forces, and had brought up many helepoles, and employed innumerable
engines, and built up lofty towers outside the wall, resistance was
offered, and the assault of the attacking engines repelled, by the
bishop Eunomius alone. Our men had refused to fight against the foe, and
were shrinking from bringing aid to the besieged, when the bishop, by
opposing himself to them, preserved the city from being taken. When one
of the barbarian chieftains ventured on his wonted blasphemy, and with
words like those of Rabshakeh and Sennacherib, madly threatened to burn
the temple of God, the holy bishop could not endure his furious wrath,
but himself commanded a balista, <span id="fr_941"></span>[942](#fn_941.md)
which went by the name of the Apostle Thomas, to be set up upon the
battlements, and a mighty stone to be adjusted to it. Then, in the name
of the Lord who had been blasphemed, he gave the word to let go,—down
crashed the stone on that impious chief and hit him on his wicked mouth,
and crushed in his face, and broke his head in pieces, and sprinkled his
brains upon the ground. When the commander of the army who had hoped to
take the city saw what was done, he confessed himself beaten and
withdrew, and in his alarm made peace.

<span id="iv.viii.v.xxxvi-p20"></span>Thus the universal sovereign
protects the faithful emperor, for he clearly acknowledges whose slave
he is, and performs fitting service to his Master. <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_935"></span>[155:936](2030176.htm#fr_935.md) <span

<span id="iv.viii.v.xxxvi-p3"></span> Theodosius II. succeeded his
father May 1, 408, at the age of eight. The translation of the remains
of Chrysostom took place at the beginning of 438. Theodosius died in
450, and the phrase “<span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.viii.v.xxxvi-p3.1"></span>ὁ</span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.viii.v.xxxvi-p3.2"></span>νῦν βασιλεὺων</span>” thus limits the
composition of the History. As however Theodoret does not continue his
list of bishops of Rome after Cælestinus, who died in 440, we may
conclude that the History was written in 438–439. But the mention of
Isdigirdes II. in Chap. xxxviii. carries us somewhat further. Possibly
the portions of the work were jotted down from time to time.

<span id="fn_936"></span>[155:937](2030176.htm#fr_936.md) <span
id="iv.viii.v.xxxvi-p3.3"></span>

<span id="iv.viii.v.xxxvi-p4"></span> Theodosius II. had four sisters,
Flaccilla, Pulcheria, Arcadia, and Marina. Pulcheria was practically
empress-regnant for a considerable period. She was only two years older
than her brother, but was declared Augusta and empress July 14, 414, at
the age of 15½. On his death in 450 she married Marcianus a general.
Besides the relics of Chrysostom she translated in 446 those of the
martyrs of Sebaste. Soz. ix. 2.

<span id="fn_937"></span>[155:938](2030176.htm#fr_937.md) <span
id="iv.viii.v.xxxvi-p4.1"></span>

<span id="iv.viii.v.xxxvi-p5"></span> “<span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.viii.v.xxxvi-p5.1"></span>τὰ θεῖα λόγια</span>.” This is the
common phrase in our author for the Holy Scriptures. According to the
interpretation given by Schleiermacher and like theologians to the title
of the work of Papias, “<span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.viii.v.xxxvi-p5.2"></span>λογίων κυριακῶν ἐξηγήσεις</span>” and
to the passage of Eusebius (Ecc. Hist. iii. 39) in which Papias is
quoted as saying that Matthew “<span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.viii.v.xxxvi-p5.3"></span>῾</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.viii.v.xxxvi-p5.4"></span>Εβραϊδι διαλέκτῳ τὰ λόγια
συνεγράψατο</span>.” Pulcheria and her sisters did not study the
Scriptures, but only “the divine discourses,” to the exclusion of
anything that was not a discourse. cf. Salmon *Introduction to the N.
T.* 4th Ed. pp. 95, 96, and Bp. Lightfoot’s Essays in reply to the
anonymous author of “Supernatural Religion.” cf. <span
id="iv.viii.v.xxxvi-p5.5"></span>[Rom. iii.

have pored over *the oracles of God.*”

<span id="iv.viii.v.xxxvi-p19"></span> It is interesting to find in the
fifth century an instance of the sacred nomenclature with which we have
familiar instances in the “San Josef” and the “Salvador del mundo” of
Cape St. Vincent, and the “Santa Anna” and “Santissima Trinidad” of
Trafalgar. (Southey, *Life of Nelson,* Chap iv. and ix.) On the north
side of Sebastopol there was an earthwork called “The Twelve Apostles.”
(Kinglake, *Crimea,* Vol. iv. p. 48.) St. Thomas was the supposed
founder of the church of Edessa.

<span id="fn_942"></span>[156:943](2030176.htm#fr_942.md) <span
id="iv.viii.v.xxxvi-p20.1"></span>

<span id="iv.viii.v.xxxvi-p21"></span> This might have been written
before the weaker elements in the character of Theodosius II. produced
their most disastrous results. But he was not a satisfactory sovereign,
nor a desirable champion of Christendom. In some respects like our
Edward the Confessor and Henry VI. he had, in the words of Leo, “the
heart of a priest as well as of an emperor.” “He had fifteen prime
ministers in twenty-five years, the last of whom, the Eunuch
Chrysaphius, retained his power for the longest period. <span
class="c14"><span id="iv.viii.v.xxxvi-p21.1"></span>a.d.</span> 443–450.
During that time the empire was rapidly hurrying to destruction. The
Vandals in Africa and the Huns under Attila in Europe were ravaging some
of his fairest provinces while the emperor was attending to palace
intrigues.…Chrysaphius made him favourable to Eutyches, and thus largely
contributed to the establishment of the monophysite heresy.” Dr. Stokes
in Dict. Christ. Biog. iv. 966.
