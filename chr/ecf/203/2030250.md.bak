<span id="iv.x.lxi-p1"></span> *LXI. To the Presbyter Archibius.*

<span id="iv.x.lxi-p2"></span>I did not let the two letters which I had
just received from you go unheeded, but wrote without delay, and gave my
letter to the very devout presbyter Eusebius. <span
id="fr_1706"></span>[1707](#fn_1706.md) In consequence of some delay, it
was for the time postponed, for the weather kept the vessels within the
harbour, inasmuch as it indicated a coming storm at sea and bade sailors
and pilots wait awhile. So I discharged this debt for the time, not that
I may cease to be a debtor but that I may increase the debt. For this
obligation becomes many times greater by being discharged, inasmuch as
they who try to observe the laws of friendship increase the potency of
its love, and, blowing sparks into a flame, kindle a greater warmth of
affection, while all who are fired thereby strive to surpass one another
in love. Receive then my defence, my venerable friend; forgive me; and
send me a letter to tell me how you are.
