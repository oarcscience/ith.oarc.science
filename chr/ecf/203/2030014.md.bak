<span id="iv.iv.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iv.iv.viii-p1.1"></span>VIII.—The Works of Theodoret.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.viii-p2"></span>Of authorities for the works of
Theodoret we may first cite himself. In four of his letters he mentions
his own writings; viz.: in lxxxii, to Eusebius of Ancyra; in cxiii, to
Leo of Rome; in cxvi, to the Presbyter Renatus; and in cxlv, to the
monks at Constantinople. Of these the first was written in 445 and the
last three in 449 and a reference to them will show the works mentioned.
It is to be noticed <span id="fr_102"></span>[103](#fn_102.md) that no
allusion is made to the refutation of the twelve chapters; to the
defence of Diodorus of Tarsus and Theodorus of Mopsuestia, nor to the
Dialogues, though all are held to have been written before the
Latrocinium. It may have been, as Garnerius conjectures, that Theodoret
did not judge it politic at this time to call attention to these
particular works, but the assumption is not based on strong grounds, and
Theodoret never appears as one unwilling to avow his convictions, which
indeed, were perfectly well known.

<span id="iv.iv.viii-p4"></span>Gennadius, presbyter of Marseilles, who
died in 496, writes “Theodoretus, bishop of Cyrus, is said to have
written many works: those, however, which have come to my knowledge are
the following; of the Incarnation of the Lord, against the presbyter
Eutyches, and Dioscorus, bishop of Alexandria, who deny that there was
in Christ human flesh,—powerful writings wherein he proves, as well by
argument as by scriptural evidence, that Christ had very flesh of the
substance of His mother, which He took from the Virgin, and very
Godhead, which by eternal generation He received, in being generated,
from God the father begetting Him. There exist also his books of
Ecclesiastical History, which he wrote in imitation of Eusebius of
Cæsarea, beginning from the end of the books of Eusebius down to his own
time, viz.: from the twentieth year of Constantine down to the reign of
Leo I, in whose reign he died.” <span id="fr_103"></span>[104](#fn_103.md)

<span id="iv.iv.viii-p6"></span>Photius, in the ninth century, says that
he has read the Ecclesiastical History; twenty-seven books against
Heresies, among which he reckons the “Eranistes;” five books
“Hæreticarum Fabularum;” five in praise of Chrysostom; with Commentaries
on Daniel, the Octateuch, Kings, Chronicles, and the Twelve Minor
Prophets.

<span id="iv.iv.viii-p7"></span>Nicephorus Callistus Xanthopulus in the
fourteenth century, Hist. Ecc. xiv. 54<span
id="iv.iv.viii-p7.1"></span>, writes: “Theodoretus, Syrian by birth, was
a follower of the great Chrysostom, whom he set before him as a model of
style. His own was flowing and copious, eloquent and easy, and not
destitute of Attic grace.” He mentions expositions of difficult passages
of the Old Testament; Commentaries on the Prophets and the Psalms; the
“de Providentia;” a volume “On the Apostles;” the Confutation of
heresies, called “the battle between truth and falsehood;” the
refutation of Cyril’s “Twelve Chapters;” the Ecclesiastical History; the
“Philotheus,” a History of the Lovers of God; three books on the divine
doctrines, and five hundred (?) letters.

<span id="iv.iv.viii-p8"></span>The following is the catalogue of extant
works as given by Sirmondus and followed by Garnerius.

<span id="iv.iv.viii-p9"></span>(i.) *Exegetical.* Questions on the
Octateuch, the Books of Kings and Chronicles; the Interpretation of the
