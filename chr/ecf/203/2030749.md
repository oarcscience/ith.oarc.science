<span id="vi.xii.i.xi-p1"></span> 10. The champion of Origen, you see,
the encomiast of Pamphilus, declares that Pamphilus wrote nothing
whatever, that he composed no single treatise of his own. And you cannot
take refuge in the hypothesis that Pamphilus wrote this book after
Eusebius’s publication, since Eusebius wrote after Pamphilus had
attained the crown of martyrdom. What then can you now do? The
consciences of a great many persons have been wounded by the book which
you have published under the name of the martyr; they give no heed to
the authority of the bishops who condemn Origen, since they think that a
martyr has praised him. Of what use are the letters of the bishop
Theophilus or of the pope Anastasius, who follow out the heretic in
every part of the world, when your book passing under the name of
Pamphilus is there to oppose their letters, and the testimony of the
martyr can be set against the authority of the Bishops? I think you had
better do with this mistitled <span id="fr_3016"></span>[3017](#fn_3016.md)
volume what you did with the books <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xii.i.xi-p2.2"></span>Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν</span>. Take my advice as a
friend, and do not be distrustful of the power of your art; say either
that you never wrote it, or else <span id="page_488">p. 488</span> <span
id="vi.xii.i.xi-Page_488"></span>that it has been depraved by the
presbyter Eusebius. <span id="fr_3017"></span>[3018](#fn_3017.md) It will
be impossible to prove against you that the book was translated by you.
Your handwriting is not forthcoming to shew it; your eloquence is not so
great as that no one can imitate your style. Or, in the last resort, if
the matter comes to the proof, and your effrontery is overborne by the
multitude of testimonies, sing a palinode after the manner of
Stesichnus. It is better that you should repent of what you have done
than that a martyr should remain under calumny, and those who have been
deceived under error. And you need not feel ashamed of changing your
opinion; you are not of such fame or authority as to feel disgraced by
the confession of an error. Take me for your example, whom you love so
much, and without whom you can neither live nor die, and say what I said
when you had praised me and I defended myself.
