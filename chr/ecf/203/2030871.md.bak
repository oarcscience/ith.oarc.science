<span id="vi.xiii.xxiii"></span>

<span id="vi.xiii.xxiii-p1"></span> 22. It is related that when Pilate
would fain have released Him all the people cried out, “Crucify Him,
Crucify Him!” <span id="fr_3320"></span>[3321](#fn_3320.md) This also the
Prophet Jeremiah foretells, saying, in the person of the Lord Himself,
“My inheritance is become to Me as a lion in the forest. He hath uttered
his voice against Me, wherefore I have hated it. And therefore (saith
He) I have forsaken and left My house.” <span
id="fr_3321"></span>[3322](#fn_3321.md) And again in another place,
“Against whom have ye opened your mouth, and against whom have ye let
loose your tongues?” <span id="fr_3322"></span>[3323](#fn_3322.md) When He
stood before His judge, it is written that “He held His peace.” <span
id="fr_3323"></span>[3324](#fn_3323.md) Many Scriptures testify of this. In
the Psalms it is written, “I became as a man that heareth not, and in
whose mouth are no reproofs.” <span id="fr_3324"></span>[3325](#fn_3324.md)
And again, “I was as a deaf man, and heard not, and as one that is dumb
and openeth not his mouth.” And again another Prophet saith, “As a lamb
before her shearer, so He opened not His mouth. In His humiliation His
judgment was taken away.” <span id="fr_3325"></span>[3326](#fn_3325.md) It
is written that there was put on Him a crown of thorns. Of this hear in
the Canticles the voice of God the Father marvelling at the iniquity of
Jerusalem in the insult done to His Son: “Go forth and see, ye daughters
of Jerusalem, the crown wherewith His mother hath crowned Him.” <span
id="fr_3326"></span>[3327](#fn_3326.md) Moreover, of the thorns another
Prophet makes mention: “I looked that she should bring forth grapes, and
she brought forth thorns, and instead of righteousness a cry.” <span
id="fr_3327"></span>[3328](#fn_3327.md) But that thou mayest know the
secrets of the mystery, it behoved Him, Who came to take away the sins
of the world, to free the earth also from the curse, which it had
received through the sin of the first man, when the Lord said “Cursed be
the earth in thy labours: thorns: and thistles shall it bring forth to
thee.” <span id="fr_3328"></span>[3329](#fn_3328.md) For this cause,
therefore, is Jesus crowned with thorns, that first sentence of
condemnation might be remitted. He is led to the cross, and the life of
the whole word is suspended on the wood of which it is made. I would
point out how this also is confirmed by testimony from the Prophets. You
find Jeremiah speaking of it thus, “Come and let us cast wood into His
bread, and crush Him out of the land of the living.” <span
id="fr_3329"></span>[3330](#fn_3329.md) And again, Moses, mourning over
them, says, “Thy life shall be suspended before thine eyes, and thou
shalt fear day and night, and shalt not believe thy life.” <span
id="fr_3330"></span>[3331](#fn_3330.md) But we must pass on, for already we
are exceeding our proposed measure of brevity, and are lengthening out
our “short word” by a long dissertation. Yet we will add a few words
more, lest we should seem altogether to have passed over what we
undertook.
