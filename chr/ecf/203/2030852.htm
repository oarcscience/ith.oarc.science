<p class="c24"><a name="vi.xiii.iv-p1"></A>  3. I <span class="c14"><a name="vi.xiii.iv-p1.1"></A>Believe in God the Father Almighty</span>.</p>  
<p class="c24"><a name="vi.xiii.iv-p2"></A>But before I begin to discuss the meaning of the words, I think it well to mention that in different Churches some additions are found in this article. This is not the case, however, in the Church of the city of Rome; the reason being, as I suppose, that, on the one hand, no heresy has had its origin there, and, on the other, that the ancient custom is there kept up, that those who are going to be baptized should rehearse the Creed publicly, that is, in the audience of the people; the consequence of which is that the ears of those who are already believers will not admit the addition of a single word. But in other places, as I understand, additions appear to have been made, on account of certain heretics, by means of which it was hoped that novelty in doctrine would be excluded. We, however, follow that order which we received when we were baptized in the Church of Aquileia.</p>  
<p class="c24"><a name="vi.xiii.iv-p3"></A>I <span class="c14"><a name="vi.xiii.iv-p3.1"></A>Believe</span>, therefore, is placed in the forefront, as the Apostle Paul, writing to the Hebrews, says, &#8220;He that cometh to God must first of all believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who believe on Him.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3256"></A><A HREF="#fn_3256"><FONT SIZE="1">3257</FONT></A>
 The Prophet also says, &#8220;Except ye believe,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3257"></A><A HREF="#fn_3257"><FONT SIZE="1">3258</FONT></A>
 ye shall not understand.&#8221; That the way to understand, therefore, may be open to you, you do rightly first of all, in professing that you believe; for no one embarks upon the sea, and trusts himself to the deep and liquid element, unless he first believes it possible that he will have a safe voyage; neither does the husbandman commit his seed to the furrows and scatter his grain on the earth, but in the belief that the showers will come, together with the sun&#146;s warmth, through whose fostering influence, aided by favouring winds, the earth will produce and multiply and ripen its fruits. In fine, nothing in life can be transacted if there be not first a readiness to believe. What wonder then, if, coming to God, we first of all profess that we believe, seeing that, without this, not even common life can be lived. We have premised these remarks at the outset, since the Pagans are wont to object to us that our religion, because it lacks reasons, rests solely on belief. We have shewn, therefore, that nothing can possibly be done or remain stable unless belief precede. Finally, marriages are contracted in the belief that children will be born; and children are committed to the care of masters in the belief that the teaching of the masters will be transferred to the pupils; and one man assumes the ensigns of empire, believing that peoples and cities and a well-equipped army also will obey him. But if no one enters upon any one of these several undertakings except in the belief that the results spoken of will follow, must not belief be much more requisite if one would come to the knowledge of God? But let us see what this &#8220;short word&#8221; of the Creed sets forth.</p>
