id="fr_2510"></span>[2511](#fn_2510.md) bishop of Ancyra, flourished in the
reign of Constantinus and Constantius and wrote many volumes of various
*Propositions* and especially against the Arians. Works of Asterius and
Apollinarius against him are current, which accuse him of Sabellianism.
Hilary too, in the seventh book of his work *Against the Arians,*
mentions him as a heretic, but he defends himself against the charge
through the fact that Julius and Athanasius bishops of Rome and
Alexandria communed with him.
