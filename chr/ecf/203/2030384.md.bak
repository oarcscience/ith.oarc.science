id="v.iii.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter I.</span>

<span id="v.iii.iii-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="v.iii.iii-p2.1"></span>Simon Peter <span
id="fr_2336"></span>[2337](#fn_2336.md) </span> the son of John, from the
village of Bethsaida in the province of Galilee, brother of Andrew the
apostle, and himself chief of the apostles, after having been bishop of
the church of Antioch and having preached to the Dispersion <span
id="fr_2337"></span>[2338](#fn_2337.md) —the believers in
circumcision, <span id="fr_2338"></span>[2339](#fn_2338.md) in Pontus,
Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia—pushed on to Rome in the second
year of Claudius to overthrow Simon Magus, <span
id="fr_2339"></span>[2340](#fn_2339.md) and held the sacerdotal chair there
for twenty-five years until the last, that is the fourteenth, year of
Nero. At his hands he received the crown of martyrdom being nailed to
the cross with his head towards the ground and his feet raised on high,
asserting that he was unworthy to be crucified in the same manner as his
Lord. He wrote two epistles which are called Catholic, the second of
which, on account of its difference from the first in style, is
considered by many not to be by him. Then too the Gospel according to
Mark, who was his disciple and interpreter, is ascribed to him. On the
other hand, the books, of which one is entitled his Acts, another his
Gospel, a third his Preaching, a fourth his Revelation, a fifth his
“Judgment” are rejected as apocryphal. <span
id="fr_2340"></span>[2341](#fn_2340.md)

<span id="v.iii.iii-p8"></span>Buried at Rome in the Vatican near the
triumphal way he is venerated by the whole world. <span

“Dispersion”—the Jews out of Judea. Cf. Peter 1. 1. See Westcott in

<span id="v.iii.iii-p7"></span> *Apocryphal.* For literature on
apocryphal works see *Ante-Nic. Fath.* ed. Coxe (N. Y. Chr. Lit. Co.,)
vol. 9 pp. 95 sq. The *Acts, Gospel, Preaching* and *Revelation* are
mentioned by Eusebius. The *Judgment* was added by Jerome. This last has
been much discussed of late in connection with the recently discovered
*Teaching of the Twelve.* The identification of the Teaching with the
Judgment is credited to Dr. von Gebhardt (Salmon in Smith and Wace
*Dict.* v. 4 (1887) pp. 810–11). The recent literature of it is immense.
Compare Schaff, *Oldest Church Manual,* and literature in *Ante-Nic.
Fath.* vol. 9 pp. 83–86.

<span id="v.iii.iii-p9"></span> The textual variations on the chapter
are numerous enough but none of them are sustained by the better <span

Simon Peter” “Simon Peter the Apostle” “Peter the Apostle”*…*“Called
canonical”*…*“are considered apocryphal”*…*“the whole city.”*
