<span id="iv.viii.iii.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.iii.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIII</span>.—*Of other
confessors*.

<span id="iv.viii.iii.xiii-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.iii.xiii-p2.1"></span>After</span> this fatal distribution
of money some of the recipients were feasting together at an
entertainment. One of them who had taken the cup in his hand did not
drink before making on it the sign of salvation. <span
id="fr_637"></span>[638](#fn_637.md)

<span id="iv.viii.iii.xiii-p4"></span>One of the guests found fault with
him for this, and said that it was quite inconsistent with what had just
taken place. “What,” said he, “have I done that is inconsistent?”
Whereupon he was reminded of the altar and the incense, and of his
denial of the faith; for these things are all contrary to the Christian
profession. When they heard this the greater number of the feasters
moaned and bewailed themselves, and tore out handfuls of hair from their
heads. They rose from the banquet, and ran through the Forum exclaiming
that they were Christians, that they had been tricked by the emperor’s
contrivances, that they retracted their apostasy, and were ready to try
to undo the defeat which had befallen them unwittingly. With these
exclamations they ran to the palace loudly inveighing against the wiles
of the tyrant, and imploring that they might be committed to the flames
in order that, as they had been befouled by fire, by fire they might be
made clean. All these utterances drove the villain out of his senses,
and on the impulse of the moment he ordered them to be beheaded; but as
they were being conducted without the city the mass of the people
started to follow them, wondering at their fortitude and glorying in
their boldness for the truth. When they had reached the spot where it
was usual to execute criminals, the eldest of them besought the
executioner that he would first cut off the head of the youngest, that
he might not be unmanned by beholding the slaughter of the rest. No
sooner had he knelt down upon the ground and the headsman bared his
sword, than up ran a man announcing a reprieve, and while yet afar off
shouting out to stop the execution. Then the youngest soldier was
distressed at his release from death. “Ah,” said he, “Romanus” (his name
was Romanus) “was not worthy of being called Christ’s martyr.” What
influenced the vile trickster in stopping the execution was his envy: he
grudged the champions of the faith their glory. Their sentence was
commuted to relegation beyond the city walls and to the remotest regions
of the empire.
