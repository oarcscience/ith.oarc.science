<span id="v.iii.lxxi-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="v.iii.lxxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter LXIX.</span>

<span id="v.iii.lxxi-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="v.iii.lxxi-p2.1"></span>Dionysius</span>, <span
id="fr_2483"></span>[2484](#fn_2483.md) bishop of Alexandria, as presbyter
had charge of the catechetical school under Heraclas, and was the most
distinguished pupil of Origen. Consenting to the doctrine of Cyprian and
the African synod, on the rebaptizing <span
id="fr_2484"></span>[2485](#fn_2484.md) of heretics, he sent many letters
to different people, which are yet extant; He wrote one to Fabius,
bishop of the church at Antioch, *On penitence,* another *To the
Romans,* by the hand of Hippolytus, two letters *To Xystus,* who had
succeeded Stephen, two also *To Philemon and Dionysius,* presbyters of
the church at Rome, and another *To* the same *Dionysius,* afterwards
bishop of Rome; and *To Novatian,* treating of their claim that Novatian
had been ordained bishop of Rome, against his will. The beginning of
this epistle is as follows: “Dionysius to Novatian, his brother
greeting. If you have been ordained unwillingly, as you say, you will
prove it, when you shall willingly retire.”

<span id="v.iii.lxxi-p5"></span>There is another epistle of his also *To
Dionysius and Didymus,* and many *Festal epistles on the passover,*
written in a declamatory style, also one to the church of Alexandria *On
exile,* one *To Hierax,* <span id="fr_2485"></span>[2486](#fn_2485.md)
bishop in Egypt, and yet others *On mortality, On the Sabbath,* and*On
the gymnasium,* also one *To Hermammon* and others *On the persecution
of Decius,* and two books *Against Nepos the bishop,* who asserted in
his writings a thousand years reign in the body. Among other things he
diligently discussed the *Apocalypse of John,* and wrote *Against
Sabellius* and *To Ammon,* bishop of Ber<span id="page_377">p.
377</span> <span id="v.iii.lxxi-Page_377"></span>nice, and *To
Telesphorus,* also *To Euphranor,* also four books *To Dionysius,*
bishop of Rome, to the Laodiceans *On penitence*, to Origen *On
martyrdom,* to the Armenians *On penitence,* <span
id="fr_2486"></span>[2487](#fn_2486.md) also *On the order of
transgression,* to Timothy *On nature,* to Euphranor *On temptation,*
many letters also *To Basilides,* in one of which he asserts that he
also began to write commentaries on Ecclesiastes. The notable epistle
which he wrote against Paul of Samosata, a few days before his death is
also current. He died in the twelfth year of Gallienus.
