<span id="iv.x.xxx-p1"></span> *XXX. To Aerius the Sophist*. <span
id="fr_1665"></span>[1666](#fn_1665)

<span id="iv.x.xxx-p3"></span>Now is the time for your Academy to prove
the use of your discussions. I am told that a brilliant assemblage
collects at your house, of which the members are both illustrious by
birth and polished of speech, and that you debate about virtue and the
immortality of the soul, and other kindred subjects. Show now
opportunely your nobility of soul and wealth of virtue, and receive the
most admirable and honourable Celestinianus in the spirit of men who
have learnt the rapid changes of human prosperity. He was formerly an
ornament of the city of Carthage, where he flung open the doors of his
house to many priests, and never thought to need a stranger’s kindness.
Be his spokesman, my friend, and aid him in his need of your voice, for
he cannot suffer the advice of the poet which bids him that needeth
speak though he be ashamed. <span id="fr_1666"></span>[1667](#fn_1666)

<span id="iv.x.xxx-p5"></span>Persuade I beg you any of your society who
are capable of so doing to emulate the hospitality of Alcinous, <span
id="fr_1667"></span>[1668](#fn_1667) to remove the poverty which has
unexpectedly befallen him, and to change his evil fortune into good. Let
them praise our kindly Lord for making us wise by other men’s
calamities, not having sent us to strangers’ houses and having brought
strangers to our doors. To men that shew kindness He promises to give
what words cannot express and no intelligence can understand.
