<span id="vi.xx-p5"></span>————————————

<span id="vi.xx-p6"></span>My dear brother, I might rightly address you
in the words of the blessed master, “You do well, dearest Donatus, in
reminding me of this;” for I well remember my promise that I would
collect all that Adamantius wrote in his old age on the Law of Moses,
and translate it into Latin for the use of our people. But, as he says,
the season was not seasonable for the fulfilment of my promise, but was
full of storm and confusion. How can the pen move freely when a man is
in fear of the missiles of the enemy, when he has before his eyes the
devastation of cities and country, when he has to fly from dangers of
the sea, and there is no safety even in exile? As you yourself saw, the
Barbarian was within sight of us; he had set fire to the city of
Rhegium, and our only protection against him was the very narrow sea
which separates the soil of Italy from Sicily. In such a position, what
leisure could there be for writing, and especially for translating, a
work in which one’s duty is not to develop one’s own opinions but to
express those of another? However, when there was a quiet night, and our
minds were relieved from the fear of an attack by the enemy, and we got
at least some little leisure for thought, I set to work, as a solace
from our troubles, and to relieve the burden of our pilgrimage, to
gather into one and arrange all that Origen had written on the book of
Numbers, whether in the way of homilies or in writings such as are
called Excerpts, <span id="fr_3446"></span>[3447](#fn_3446.md) and to
translate them into the Roman tongue. You urged me to do this, Ursacius,
and aided me with all your might, indeed, so eager were you, that you
thought the youth who acted as secretary too slow in the execution of
his office. I wish, however, to point out to you, my brother, that the
object of this method of studying scripture is not to deal with each
clause separately, as you find done in commentaries, but to open up a
path for the understanding, so that the reader may not be made
negligent, but as it is written <span
id="fr_3447"></span>[3448](#fn_3447.md) may “stir up his own spirit” and
draw out the meaning, and, when he has heard the good word, may add to
it by his own wisdom. In this way I have tried to give all the
expositions which you desired; and now of all the writings that I have
found upon the Law the short comments upon Deuteronomy alone are
wanting; these, if God so will, and if he restores my eye-sight, I hope
to add to the body of the work. Indeed, my very loving son Pinianus,
whose truly Christian company I have joined in their flight because of
my delight in their chaste conversation, requires yet other tasks from
me. But do you and he join your prayers that the Lord may be present
with us, and may give peace in our time, and shew mercy to those who are
in trouble, and make our work fruitful for the edification of the
reader.
