id="iv.viii.v.xx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XX</span>.—*Of the destruction of
the temples all over the Empire.*

<span id="iv.viii.v.xx-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.v.xx-p2.1"></span>Now</span> the right faithful emperor
diverted his energies to resisting paganism, and published edicts in
which he ordered the shrines of the idols to be destroyed. Constantine
the Great, most worthy of all eulogy, was indeed the first to grace his
empire with true religion; and when he saw the world still given over to
foolishness he issued a general prohibition against the offering of
sacrifices to the idols. He had not, however, destroyed the temples,
though he ordered them to be kept shut. His sons followed in their
father’s footsteps. Julian restored the false faith and rekindled the
flame of the ancient fraud. On the accession of Jovian he once more
placed an interdict on the worship of idols, and Valentinian the Great
governed Europe with like laws. Valens, however, allowed every one else
to worship any way they would and to honour their various objects of
adoration. Against the champions of the Apostolic decrees alone he
persisted in waging war. Accordingly during the whole period of his
reign the altar fire was lit, libations and sacrifices were offered to
idols, public feasts were celebrated in the forum, and votaries
initiated in the orgies of Dionysus ran about in goat-skins, mangling
hounds in Bacchic frenzy, and generally behaving in such a way as to
show the iniquity of their master. When the right faithful Theodosius
found all these evils he pulled them up by the roots, and consigned them
to oblivion. <span id="fr_888"></span>[889](#fn_888.md)

Theodosium pro templis in qua docet quomodo se gesserint imperatores
Christiani erga paganos. Et Constantinum quidem Magnum ait duntaxat
spoliasse templa, Constantium vero ejus filium prohibuisse Sacrificia:
ejusque legem a secutis imperatoribus et ab ipsomet Theodosio esse
observatam; reliqua vera permissa fuisse paganis, id est turificationem
et publicas epulas.”* Valesius.
