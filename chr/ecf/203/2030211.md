<span id="iv.x.xxii-p1"></span> *XXII. To Count Ulpianus.*

<span id="iv.x.xxii-p2"></span>It is said that what is faulty in men’s
ways may be brought to order and improved by words. But I think that
characters made beautiful by nature, themselves make words fair, though
they stand in need of none, just as bodies naturally beautiful need no
artificial colouring. These qualities are conspicuous in the right
eloquent orator Athanasius, and I have been the more pleased with him
because he is an ardent lover of your Excellency, and is constantly
sounding your praises. Here, however, I have striven with him, and in
enumerating your high qualities, have outdone him, for I know more about
good deeds of yours than he. I am however vexed at not being able to
praise them all, and to see that my summary of your virtues falls short
of what might be said in your praise, but if God grant it even to
approach the truth you will hold the pre-eminence in every kind of
virtue among all your contemporaries. <span

Ulpianus or of this Athanasius.
