<span id="iv.x.cxxxviii-p1"></span> *CXXXVII. To the Archimandrite
John.* <span id="fr_1977"></span>[1978](#fn_1977.md)

<span id="iv.x.cxxxviii-p3"></span>The blessed David fell into several
errors, which God, who wisely orders all things, has caused to be
recorded for the good of them that were to come after. But it was not on
their account that Absalom, parricide, murderer, impious, and altogether
vile, started his wild war against his father. The reason of his
beginning that most unrighteous struggle was because he coveted the
sovereignty. The divine David, however, when these events were coming to
pass, began to remember the wrong that he had done. I too am conscious
within myself of the guilt of many errors, but I have kept undefiled the
dogmatic teaching of the Apostles. And they who have trampled upon all
laws human and divine, and condemned me in my absence, have not
sentenced me for what I have done wrong, for my secret deeds are not
made manifest to them; but they have contrived false witness and calumny
against me, or rather in their open attack upon the doctrines of the
Apostles have proscribed me for my obedience to them. “So the Lord
awaked as one out of sleep; He smote His enemies in the hinderparts and
put them to a perpetual shame.” <span

He has scattered to the winds, and has provided for the free preaching
of those which He has handed down to us in the holy Gospels. To me this
suffices for complete delight. I do not even long for a city in which I
have passed all my time in hard work; all I long for is to see the
establishment of the truth of the Gospels. And now the Lord has
satisfied this longing. I am therefore very glad <span id="page_307">p.
307</span> <span id="iv.x.cxxxviii-Page_307"></span>and happy, and I
sing praises to our generous Lord, and I invite your reverence to
rejoice with me, and, with our praises, to put up the earnest prayer
that the men who say now one thing and now another and change about to
suit the hour, like the chameleons who assume the colour of the leaves,
may be strengthened by the loving-kindness of the Lord, established upon
the rocks and, of His mercy, made to pay the highest honour to the
truth.

Constantinople and was present at Chalcedon in 451, (Labbe iv. 512 d)
but there is no evidence to identify the recipient of the present
letter, which may be dated from Nicerte not long after the death of
Theodosius.
