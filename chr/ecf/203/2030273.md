<span id="iv.x.lxxxiv"></span>

<span id="iv.x.lxxxiv-p1"></span> *LXXXIV. To the Bishops of
Cilicia.* <span id="fr_1778"></span>[1779](#fn_1778.md)

<span id="iv.x.lxxxiv-p3"></span>Your piety has heard of the calumnies
directed against me. The opponents of the truth allege that I divide our
one Lord Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God, into two sons, and
it is said by some that a ground for their calumny is derived from a
handful of men among you who hold these opinions, and who divide God the
Word made man into two sons. They ought to listen to those words of the
Apostle which openly declare “one Lord Jesus Christ by whom are all
things,” <span id="fr_1779"></span>[1780](#fn_1779.md) and again “one Lord,
one faith, one baptism.” <span id="fr_1780"></span>[1781](#fn_1780.md) They
ought to have followed the Master’s teaching, for the Lord Himself says
“And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from
heaven, even the Son of man which is in Heaven.” <span
id="fr_1781"></span>[1782](#fn_1781.md) And again “If ye shall see the Son
of Man ascend up where He was before.” <span
id="fr_1782"></span>[1783](#fn_1782.md) And the tradition of holy baptism
teaches us that there is one Son, just as there is one Father and one
Holy Ghost. I hope then that your piety will deign, if there really are
any, though I cannot believe it, who disobey the apostolic doctrines to
close their mouths, to rebuke them as the laws of the Church require,
and teach them to follow the footsteps of the holy Fathers and preserve
undefiled the faith laid down at Nicæa in Bithynia by the holy and
blessed Fathers, as summing <span id="page_281">p. 281</span> <span
id="iv.x.lxxxiv-Page_281"></span>up the teaching of Evangelists and
Apostles. For it becomes you who love God to give heed both to God’s
glory and our common credit, and not to overlook the attacks which are
made upon us all through the ignorance or contentiousness of these few
men—if they really are guilty, and if they are not, like ourselves,
suffering from the whetted tongues of false accusers.

<span id="iv.x.lxxxiv-p8"></span>Deign to remember us in your prayers to
God, for so the law of love ordains.
