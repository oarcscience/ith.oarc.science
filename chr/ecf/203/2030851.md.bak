<span id="vi.xiii.iii-p1"></span> 2. Our forefathers have handed down to
us the tradition, that, after the Lord’s ascension, when, through the
coming of the Holy Ghost, tongues of flame had settled upon each of the
Apostles, that they might speak diverse languages, so that no race
however foreign, no tongue however barbarous, might be inaccessible to
them and beyond their reach, they were commanded by the Lord to go
severally to the several nations to preach the word of God. Being on the
eve therefore of departing from one another, they first mutually agreed
upon a standard of their future preaching, lest haply, when separated,
they might in any instance vary in the statements which they should make
to those whom they should invite to believe in Christ. Being all
therefore met together, and being filled with the Holy Ghost, they
composed, as we have said, this brief formulary of their future
preaching, each contributing his several sentence to one common summary:
and they ordained that the rule thus framed should be given to those who
believe.

<span id="vi.xiii.iii-p2"></span>To this formulary, for many and most
sufficient reasons, they gave the name or Symbol. For Symbol (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xiii.iii-p2.1"></span>κύμβολον</span>) in
Greek answers to both “Indicium” (a sign or token) and “Collatio” (a
joint contribution made by several) in Latin. For this the Apostles did
in these words, each contributing his several sentence. It is called
“Indicium” or “Signum,” a sign or token, because, at that time, as the
Apostle Paul says, and as is related in the Acts of the Apostles, many
of the vagabond Jews, pretending to be apostles of Christ, went about
preaching for gain’s sake or their belly’s sake, naming the name of
Christ indeed, but not delivering their message according to the exact
traditional lines. The Apostles therefore prescribed this formulary as a
sign or token by which he who preached Christ truly, according to
Apostolic rule, might be recognised. Finally, they say that in civil
wars, since the armour of both sides is alike, and the language the
same, and the custom and mode of warfare the same, each general, to
guard against treachery, is wont to deliver to his soldiers a distinct
symbol or watchword—in Latin “signum” or “indicium”—so that if one is
met with, of whom it is doubtful to which side he belongs, being asked
the sym<span id="page_543">p. 543</span> <span
id="vi.xiii.iii-Page_543"></span>bol (watchword), he discloses whether
he is friend or foe. And for this reason, the tradition continues, the
Creed is not written on paper or parchment, but is retained in the
hearts of the faithful, that it may be certain that no one has learnt it
by reading, as is sometimes the case with unbelievers, but by tradition
from the Apostles.

<span id="vi.xiii.iii-p3"></span>The Apostles therefore, as we have
said, being about to separate in order to preach the Gospel, settled
upon this sign or token of their agreement in the faith; and, unlike the
sons of Noah, who, when they were about to separate from one another,
builded a tower of baked bricks and pitch, whose top might reach to
heaven, they raised a monument of faith, which might withstand the
enemy, composed of living stones and pearls of the Lord, such that
neither winds might overthrow it, nor floods undermine it, nor the force
of storms and tempests shake it. Right justly, then, were the former,
when, on the eve of separation, they builded a tower of pride, condemned
to the confusion of tongues, so that no one might understand his
neighbour’s speech; while the latter, who were building a tower of
faith, were endowed with the knowledge and understanding of all
languages; so that the one might prove a sign and token of sin, the
other of faith.

<span id="vi.xiii.iii-p4"></span>But it is time now that we should say
something about these same pearls, among which is placed first the
fountain and source of all, when it is said,—
