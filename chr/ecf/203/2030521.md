<span id="v.iv.ii-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="v.iv.ii-p2.1"></span>James</span>, <span
id="fr_2572"></span>[2573](#fn_2572) surnamed the Wise, was bishop of
Nisibis the famous city of the Persians and one of the confessors under
Maximinus the persecutor. He was also one of those who, in the Nicean
council, by their opposition overthrew the Arian perversity of the
Homoousia. That the blessed Jerome mentions this man in his *Chronicle*
as a man of great virtues and yet does not place him in his catalogue of
writers, will be easily explained if we note that of the three or four
Syrians whom he mentions he says that he read them translated into the
Greek. From this it is evident that, at that period, he did not know the
Syriac language or literature and therefore he did not know a writer who
had not yet been translated into another language. All his writings are
contained in twenty-six books namely *On faith, Against all heresies, On
charity towards all, On fasting, On prayer, On particular affection
towards our neighbor, On the resurrection, On the life after death, On
humility, On penitence, <span id="fr_2573"></span>[2574](#fn_2573) On
satisfaction, On virginity, On the worth* <span
id="fr_2574"></span>[2575](#fn_2574) *of the soul, On circumcision, On
the blessed grapes, On the saying in Isaiah, “the grape cluster shall
not be destroyed,” That Christ is the son of God and consubstantial with
the Father, On chastity, Against the Nations, On the construction of the
tabernacle, On the conversation of the nations, On the Persian kingdom,
On the persecution of the Christians.* He composed also a *Chronicle* of
little interest indeed to the Greeks, but of great reliability in that
it is constructed only on the authority of the Divine Scriptures. It
shuts the mouths of those who, on some daring guess, idly philosophize
concerning the advent of Antichrist, or of our Lord. This man died in
the time of Constantius and according to the direction of his father
Constantine was buried within the walls of Nisibis, for the protection
evidently of the city, and it turned out as Constantine had expected.
For many years after, Julian having entered Nisibis and grudging either
the glory of him who was buried there or the faith of Constantine, whose
family he persecuted on account of this envy, ordered the remains of the
saint to be carried out of the city, and a few months later, as a matter
of public policy, the Emperor Jovian who succeeded Julian, gave over to
the barbarians the city which, with the adjoining territory, is subject
unto the Persian rule until this day.

for “penitence” but the only one which the translator has been able to
find which gives both is one at Wolfenbüttel dated 1460, nor is it in
the earliest editions (e.g.) Nürn. Koburger 1495, Paris 1512). But the
later editions (Fabricius, Herding) have both.
