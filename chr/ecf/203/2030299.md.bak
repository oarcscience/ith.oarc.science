<span id="iv.x.cx-p1"></span> *CX. To Domnus, Bishop of Antioch.* <span
id="fr_1856"></span>[1857](#fn_1856.md)

<span id="iv.x.cx-p3"></span>When I read your letter I remembered the
very blessed Susannah, who when she saw the famous villains, and
believed that the God of all was present, uttered that remarkable cry,
“I am straitened on every side;” <span
id="fr_1857"></span>[1858](#fn_1857.md) but nevertheless preferred to fall
into the snares of slander rather than to despise the just God. And I,
sir, have two alternatives as I have often said, to offend God and wound
my conscience, or to fall by man’s unjust sentence. The most pious
emperor, I think, knows nothing of this. For what hindered him from
writing, and ordering the ordination to take place, if in truth it so
pleased him? Why in the world do they utter threats without and cause
alarm, and yet do not send letters openly ordering it? One of two things
must be true; either the very pious emperor is not induced to write, or
they are trying to make us break the law and afterwards be indicted by
them for illegality. I have before me the example of the blessed
Principius, <span id="fr_1858"></span>[1859](#fn_1858.md) for in that case,
when they had given orders by writing, they punished him for obedience.
Moreover the letters which I read on the very day of the letter-bearer’s
arrival are of a contrary tenour. For one of the holy monks has written
to some one that he has received letters both from the very illustrious
guardsman and the very glorious ex-magister stating that the case of the
very godly lord bishop Irenæus will stand more favourably, and in return
for this good will they ask prayers on their behalf. I think therefore
that a reply ought to be written to the clergy who have written from the
imperial city to the effect that <span
id="fr_1859"></span>[1860](#fn_1859.md) “in obedience to the sentence of
the very godly bishops of Phœnicia, and knowing both the zeal and the
magnanimity and love for the poor and all the other virtues of the very
godly bishop Irenæus, and in addition to this the orthodoxy of his
opinions, I have ordained him. I am not aware that he has ever objected
to apply to the holy Virgin the title ‘Theotokos,’ or has ever held any
other opinions contrary to the doctrines of the Gospel. As to the
question of digamy, I have followed my predecessors; for Alexander of
blessed and sacred memory, the ornament of this apostolic see, as well
as the very blessed Acacius, bishop of Berœa, ordained Diogenes of
blessed memory who was a ‘digamus;’ <span
id="fr_1860"></span>[1861](#fn_1860.md) and similarly the blessed Praylius
ordained Domninus of Cæsarea who was a ‘digamus.’ <span
id="fr_1861"></span>[1862](#fn_1861.md) We have therefore followed
precedent, and the example of men well known and illustrious both for
learning and character. Proclus, bishop of Constantinople, of blessed
memory well aware of this and many other instances, both himself
accepted the ordination, and wrote in praise and admiration of it. So
too did the leading godly bishops of the Pontic Diocese, <span
id="fr_1862"></span>[1863](#fn_1862.md) and all the Palestinians.

<span id="iv.x.cx-p11"></span>“No doubt has been raised about the
matter, and we hold it wrong to condemn a man illustrious for many and
various noble actions.” In my opinion it is becoming to write in these
terms. If your holiness holds any other view, let what seems good to you
be done. I, as they suppose, have undergone one punishment, and am ready
by God’s help to undergo yet another. Even a third and fourth, if they
like, by the stay of God’s grace I will endure, praising the Lord. If
your holiness thinks right, let us see what answer comes from Palestine,
and, after considering more exactly what course is to be taken, let us
so write to Constantinople.

<span id="iv.x.cx-p2"></span> This letter is placed by Garnerius in the
end of 447 on account of its allusion to Proclus, who died in October
447, and to the deposition of Irenæus of Tyre, for which the formal
edict was issued in Feb. 448, but which was perhaps rumoured earlier.
But by some the death of Proclus is placed a year earlier.

<span id="iv.x.cx-p5"></span> Of the blessed Principius nothing is
known. cf. Tillemont, XV. 267.

id="iv.x.cx-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iv.x.cx-p6"></span> “The phraseology of this letter has given
rise to much misapprehension. The use of the first person has led some
to suppose that Theodoret, who belonged to another province, was the
consecrator of Irenæus, or that he took part in his consecration, or
even with the Abbé Martin (le Pseudo-Synode d’Éphèse, pp. 84, 85) that
it is erroneously ascribed to Theodoret, and was really written by
Domnus. It is clear from the tenor of the epistle that it was written by
Theodoret, and that the first person is employed by him as writing in
Domnus’ name. (Tillemont xv. pp. 871, 872.)” Dict. Christ. Biog. iii.
281 n.

<span id="iv.x.cx-p7"></span>It is in consonance with this theory that
Alexander of Antioch is described as bishop of *this* apostolic see, a
phrase natural for Domnus to use, but not for Theodoret.

<span id="fn_1860"></span>[290:1861](2030299.htm#fr_1860.md) <span
id="iv.x.cx-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iv.x.cx-p8"></span> It is uncertain who this Diogenes was; he
cannot have been Diogenes of Cyzicus, for he was alive and present at
Chalcedon in 451.

<span id="fn_1861"></span>[290:1862](2030299.htm#fr_1861.md) <span
id="iv.x.cx-p8.1"></span>

<span id="iv.x.cx-p9"></span> No more is known of Domninus or Praylius.
cf. p. 157. “It is clear from the Philosophumena of Hippolytus (ix, 12.)
that by the beginning of the third century the rule of monogamy for the
clergy was well established, since he complains that in the days of
Callistus ‘digamist and trigamist bishops, priests, and deacons *began*
to be admitted.’” Dict. Christ. Ant. i. 552.

<span id="fn_1862"></span>[290:1863](2030299.htm#fr_1862.md) <span
id="iv.x.cx-p9.1"></span>

<span id="iv.x.cx-p10"></span> The Pontic Diocese is one of the twelve
civil divisions of the Constantinian empire.
