<span id="vi.xiii.xxiv-p1"></span> 23. It is written that when the side
of Jesus was pierced “He shed thereout blood and water.” <span
id="fr_3331"></span>[3332](#fn_3331.md) This has a mystical meaning. For
Himself had said, “Out of His belly shall flow rivers of living
water.” <span id="fr_3332"></span>[3333](#fn_3332.md) But He shed forth
blood also, of which the Jews sought that it might be upon themselves
and upon their children. He shed forth water, therefore, which might
wash believers; He shed forth blood also which might condemn
unbelievers. Yet it might be understood also as prefiguring the twofold
grace of baptism, one that which is given by the baptism of water, the
other that which is sought through martyrdom in the outpouring of blood,
for both are called baptism. But if you ask <span id="page_553">p.
553</span> <span id="vi.xiii.xxiv-Page_553"></span>further why our Lord
is said to have poured forth blood and water from His side rather than
from any other member, I imagine that by the rib in the side the woman
is signified. Since the fountain of sin and death proceeded from the
first woman, who was the rib of the first Adam, the fountain of
redemption and life is drawn from the rib of the second Adam.
