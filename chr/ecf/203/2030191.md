<span id="iv.x.ii-p1"></span> *II. To the Same.*

<span id="iv.x.ii-p2"></span>When men love warmly, I doubt whether in
the case of the children of those whom they love, they can be impartial
judges. Justice is carried away by affection. Fathers fancy that their
ugly boys are beautiful, and sons do not see the uncomeliness of their
fathers. Brother looks at brother in the light of affection rather than
of nature. It is thus that I am afraid your holiness has judged what I
have written, and that the sentence has been delivered by warmth of
feeling. For truly the power of love is very great, and not seldom it
keeps out of sight considerable errors in our friends. It is because you
have so much of it, my dear friend, that you have wreathed what I have
written with your kindly praises. All I can do is to ask your piety to
beseech the good Lord to ratify your eulogy, and make the man you have
praised something like the picture painted in the words of his admirers.
