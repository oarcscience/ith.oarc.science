<span id="iv.viii.iv.ix-Page_114"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.iv.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter IX</span>.—*Of the heresy of the
Audiani*.

<span id="iv.viii.iv.ix-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.iv.ix-p2.1"></span>The</span> illustrious emperor thus took
heed of the apostolic decrees, but Audæus, a Syrian alike in race and in
speech, appeared at that time as an inventor of new decrees. He had long
ago begun to incubate iniquities and now appeared in his true character.
At first he understood in an absurd sense the passage “Let us make man
in our image, after our likeness.” <span
id="fr_697"></span>[698](#fn_697) From want of apprehension of the
meaning of the divine Scripture he understood the Divine Being to have a
human form, and conjectured it to be enveloped in bodily parts; for Holy
Scripture frequently describes the divine operations under the names of
human parts, since by these means the providence of God is made more
easily intelligible to minds incapable of perceiving any immaterial
ideas. To this impiety Audæus added others of a similar kind. By an
eclectic process he adopted some of the doctrines of Manes <span
id="fr_698"></span>[699](#fn_698) and denied that the God of the
universe is creator of either fire or darkness. But these and all
similar errors are concealed by the adherents of his faction.

<span id="iv.viii.iv.ix-p5"></span>They allege that they are separated
from the assemblies of the Church. But since some of them exact a cursed
usury, and some live unlawfully with women without the bond of wedlock,
while those who are innocent of these practices live in free fellowship
with the guilty, they hide the blasphemy of their doctrines by
accounting as they do for their living by themselves. The plea is
however an impudent one, and the natural result of Pharisaic teaching,
for the Pharisees accused the Physician of souls and bodies in their
question to the holy Apostles “How is it that your Master eateth with
publicans and sinners?” <span id="fr_699"></span>[700](#fn_699) and
through the prophet, God of such men says “Which say, ‘come not near me
for I am pure’ this is smoke of my wrath.” <span
id="fr_700"></span>[701](#fn_700) But this is not a time to refute their
unreasonable error. I therefore pass on to the remainder of my
narrative. <span id="fr_701"></span>[702](#fn_701)

<span id="iv.viii.iv.ix-p8"></span> Anthropomorphism, or the attribution
to God of a human *form* is the frequent result of an unintelligent
anthropopathism, which ascribes to God human *feelings.* Paganism did
not rise higher than the material view. Judaism, sometimes apparently
anthropomorphic, taught a Spiritual God. Tertullian uses expressions
which exposed him to the charge of anthropomorphism, and the Pseudo
Clementines (xvii. 2) go farther. The Audæus of the text appears to be
the first founder of anything like an anthropomorphic sect.
