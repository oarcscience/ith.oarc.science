<span id="iv.viii.iv.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.iv.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIV</span>.—*Of the holy Barses,
and of the exile of the bishop of Edessa and his companions*.

<span id="iv.viii.iv.xiv-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.iv.xiv-p2.1"></span>Barses</span>, whose fame is now great
not only in his own city of Edessa, and in neighbouring towns, but in
Phœnicia, in Egypt, and in the Thebaid, through all which regions he had
travelled with a high reputation won by his great virtue, had been
relegated by Valens to the island of Aradus, <span
id="fr_716"></span>[717](#fn_716.md) but when the emperor learnt that
innumerable multitudes streamed thither, because Barses was full of
apostolic grace, and drove out sicknesses with a word, he sent him to
Oxyrynchus <span id="fr_717"></span>[718](#fn_717.md) in Egypt; but there
too his fame drew all men to him, and the old man, worthy of heaven, was
led off to a remote castle near the country of the barbarians of that
district, by name Pheno. It is said that in Aradus his bed has been
preserved to this day, where it is held in very great honour, for many
sick persons lie down upon it and by means of their faith recover.
