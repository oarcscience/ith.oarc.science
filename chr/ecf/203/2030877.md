<span id="vi.xiii.xxix-p1"></span> 28. That He descended into hell is
also evidently foretold in the Psalms, where it is said, “Thou hast
brought Me also into the dust of the death.” <span
id="fr_3349"></span>[3350](#fn_3349) And again, “What profit is there in
my blood, when I shall have descended into corruption?” <span

pit.” <span id="fr_3355"></span>[3356](#fn_3355) There follows next,—
