<span id="iv.viii.i.xxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.i.xxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXV</span>.—*An account of the
plot formed against the Holy Athanasius*.

<span id="iv.viii.i.xxvi-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.i.xxvi-p2.1"></span>Alexander</span>, that admirable bishop,
who had successfully withstood the blasphemies of Arius, died five
months after the council of Nicæa, <span id="page_61">p. 61</span> <span
id="iv.viii.i.xxvi-Page_61"></span>and was succeeded in the episcopate
of the church of Alexandria by Athanasius. Trained from his youth in
sacred studies, Athanasius had attracted general admiration in each
ecclesiastical office that he filled. He had, at the general council, so
defended the doctrines of the apostles, that while he won the
approbation of all the champions of the truth, its opponents learned to
look on their antagonist as a personal foe and public enemy. He had
attended the council as one of the retinue of Alexander, then a very
young man, although he was the principal deacon <span
id="fr_428"></span>[429](#fn_428.md) .

<span id="iv.viii.i.xxvi-p4"></span>When those who had denied the
only-begotten Son of God heard that the helm of the Church of Alexandria
had been entrusted to his hands knowing as they did by experience his
zeal for the truth, they thought that his rule would prove the
destruction of their authority. They, therefore, resorted to the
following machinations against him. In order to avert suspicion, they
bribed some of the adherents of Meletius, who, although deposed by the
council of Nicæa, had persevered in exciting commotions in the Thebaid
and in the adjacent part of Egypt, and persuaded them to go to the
emperor, and to accuse Athanasius of levying a tax upon Egypt <span
id="fr_429"></span>[430](#fn_429.md) , and giving the gold collected to a
certain man who was preparing to usurp the imperial power <span
id="fr_430"></span>[431](#fn_430.md) . The emperor being deceived by this
story, Athanasius was brought to Constantinople. Upon his arrival he
proved that the accusation was false, and had the charge given him by
God restored to him. This is shown by a letter from the emperor to the
Church of Alexandria of which I shall transcribe only the concluding
paragraph.

<span id="iv.viii.i.xxvi-p7"></span>A Portion of the Letter from the
Emperor Constantine to the Alexandrians.

<span id="iv.viii.i.xxvi-p8"></span>“<span class="c14"><span
id="iv.viii.i.xxvi-p8.1"></span>Believe</span> me, my brethren, the
wicked men were unable to effect anything against your bishop. They
surely could have had no other design than to waste our time, and to
leave themselves no place for repentance in this life. Do you,
therefore, help yourselves, and love that which wins your love <span
id="fr_431"></span>[432](#fn_431.md) ; and exert all your power in the
expulsion of those who wish to destroy your concord. Look unto God, and
love one another. I joyfully welcomed Athanasius your bishop; and I have
conversed with him as with one whom I know to be a man of God.”

id="iv.viii.i.xxvi-p3.1"></span>τοῦ χοροῦ τῶν διακόνων
ἡγούμενος</span>.” The youth of Athanasius indicates a variety in the
qualifications for the archidiaconate, for he can hardly have been the
senior deacon. Cf. Dict. Christian Ant., Art. ‘Archdeacon.’

class="Greek"><span id="iv.viii.i.xxvi-p5.1"></span>στιχάρια</span> or
variegated vestments. Ath. Apol. cont. Ar. V. §60. The possibility of
such charges indicates the importance of the Patriarchate.

id="iv.viii.i.xxvi-p9.1"></span>τὸ φίλτρον τὸ ὑμέτερον</span>.
Athanasius (Apol. cont. Ar. V. §62) quotes the phrase as <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.viii.i.xxvi-p9.2"></span>ἡ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.viii.i.xxvi-p9.3"></span>μέτερον</span>, “our
love.”
