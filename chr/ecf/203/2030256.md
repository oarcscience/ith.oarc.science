<span id="iv.x.lxvii-p1"></span> *LXVII. To Maranas.*

<span id="iv.x.lxvii-p2"></span>It was thy work, my good Sir, to call
the rest also to the feast of the dedication. Through thy zeal and
energy the holy temple has been built, and the loud-voiced heralds of
the truth have come to dwell therein, and guard them that approach
thither in faith. Nevertheless I write and signify the season of the
feast.
