<span id="vi.xii.i.xviii"></span>

<span id="vi.xii.i.xviii-p1"></span> 17. I say nothing of the Greeks,
since you boast of your knowledge of them, even to the extent of saying
that, in attaching yourself to foreign literature, you have forgotten
your own language. I am afraid that, according to the old proverbs, I
might be like the pig teaching Minerva, and the man carrying fagots into
the wood. I only wonder that, being as you are the Aristarchus <span
id="fr_3027"></span>[3028](#fn_3027.md) of our time, you should have shewn
ignorance of these matters which every boy knows. It is, no doubt, from
your mind being fixed on the meaning of what you write, but partly also
from your being so sharp-sighted for the manufacture of calumnies
against me, that you despise the precepts of Grammarians and orators,
that you make no attempt to set straight words which have got transposed
when the sentence has become complicated, or to avoid some harsh
collocation of consonants, or to escape from a style full of gaps. It
would be ridiculous to point to one or two wounds when the whole body is
enfeebled and broken. I will not select portions for criticism; it is
for him to select any portion which is free from faults. He must have
been ignorant even of the Socratic saying: “Know thyself.”

<span id="vi.xii.i.xviii-p3"></span>To steer the ship the untaught
landsman fears;

<span id="vi.xii.i.xviii-p4"></span>Th’ untrain’d attendant dares not
give the sick

<span id="vi.xii.i.xviii-p5"></span>The drastic southernwood. The
healing drug

<span id="vi.xii.i.xviii-p6"></span>The leech alone prescribes. Th’
artificer

<span id="vi.xii.i.xviii-p7"></span>Alone the tools can wield. But
poetry

<span id="vi.xii.i.xviii-p8"></span>Train’d or untrain’d we all at
random write. <span id="fr_3028"></span>[3029](#fn_3028.md)

<span id="vi.xii.i.xviii-p10"></span>Possibly he will swear that he has
never learned to read and write; I can easily believe that without an
oath. Or perhaps he will take refuge in what the Apostle says of
himself: “Though I be rude in speech, yet not in knowledge.” But his
reason for saying this is plain. He had been trained in Hebrew learning
and brought up at the feet of Gamaliel, whom, though he had attained
apostolic rank, he was not ashamed to call his master; and he thought
Greek eloquence of no account, or at all events, in his humility, he
would not parade his knowledge of it. So that <span
id="fr_3029"></span>[3030](#fn_3029.md) ‘his preaching should stand not in
the persuasive wisdom of words but in the power of the things
signified.’ He despised other men’s riches since he was rich in his own.
Still it was not to an illiterate man who stumbled in every sentence
that Festus cried, as he stood before his judgment seat:

<span id="vi.xii.i.xviii-p12"></span>“Paul thou art beside thyself; much
learning doth make thee mad.” <span id="fr_3030"></span>[3031](#fn_3030.md)
You who can hardly do more than mutter in Latin, and who rather creep
like a tortoise than walk, ought either to write in Greek, so that among
those who are ignorant of Greek you may pass for one who knows a foreign
tongue; or else, if you attempt to write Latin, you should first have a
grammar-master, and flinch from the ferule, and begin again as an old
scholar among children to learn the art of speaking. Even if a man is
bursting with the wealth of Crœsus and Darius, letters will not follow
the money-bag. They are the companions of toil and of labour, the
associates of the fasting not of the full-fed, of self-mastery not of
self-indulgence. <span id="fr_3031"></span>[3032](#fn_3031.md) It is <span
id="page_492">p. 492</span> <span
id="vi.xii.i.xviii-Page_492"></span>told of Demosthenes that he consumed
more oil than wine, and that no workman ever shortened his nights as he
did. He for the sake of enunciating the single letter Rho was willing to
take a dog as his teacher; and yet you make it a crime in me that I took
a man to teach me the Hebrew letters. This is the sort of wisdom which
makes men remain unlearned: they do not choose to learn what they do not
know. They forget the words of Horace:

<span id="vi.xii.i.xviii-p15"></span>Why through false shame do I choose
ignorance,

<span id="vi.xii.i.xviii-p16"></span>Rather than seek to learn?

<span id="vi.xii.i.xviii-p17"></span>That Book of Wisdom also which is
read to us as the work of Solomon says: <span
id="fr_3032"></span>[3033](#fn_3032.md) “Into a malicious soul wisdom shall
not enter, nor dwell in the body that is subject to sin. For the Holy
Spirit of discipline <span id="fr_3033"></span>[3034](#fn_3033.md) will
flee deceit and remove from thoughts which are without understanding.”
The case is different with those who only wish to be read by the vulgar,
and do not care how they may offend the ears of the learned; and they
despise the utterance of the poet which brands the forwardness of noisy
ignorance.

<span id="vi.xii.i.xviii-p20"></span>’Twas you, I think, whose ignorance
in the streets

<span id="vi.xii.i.xviii-p21"></span>Murder’d the wretched strain with
creaking reed.

<span id="vi.xii.i.xviii-p22"></span>If you want such things, there are
plenty of curly-pated fellows in every school who will sing you snatches
of doggrel from Miletus; or you may go to the exhibition of the
Bessi <span id="fr_3034"></span>[3035](#fn_3034.md) and see people shaking
with laughter at the Pig’s Testament, or at any jesters’ entertainment
where silly things of this kind are run after. There is not a day but
you may see the dressed-up clown in the streets whacking the buttocks of
some blockhead, or half-pulling out people’s teeth with the scorpion
which he twists round for them to bite. We need not wonder if the books
of know-nothings find plenty of readers.
