<span id="vi.xiii.xxxii-p1"></span>31. <span class="c14"><span
id="vi.xiii.xxxii-p1.1"></span>He Ascended into Heaven, and Sitteth on
the Right Hand of the Father: from Thence He Shall Come to Judge the
Quick and the Dead</span>. These clauses follow with suitable brevity at
the end of this part of the Creed which treats of the Son. What is said
is plain, but the question is how and in what sense it is to be
understood. For to “ascend,” and to “sit,” and to “come,” unless you
understand the words in accordance with the dignity of the divine
nature, appear to point to something of human weakness. For having
consummated what was to be done on earth, and having recalled souls from
the captivity of hell, He is spoken of as ascending up to heaven, as the
Prophet had foretold, “Ascending up on high He led captivity captive,
and gave gifts unto men,” <span id="fr_3374"></span>[3375](#fn_3374.md)
those gifts, namely, which Peter, in the Acts of the Apostles, spoke of
concerning the Holy Ghost, “Being therefore by the right hand of God
exalted, He hath shed forth this gift which ye do see and hear.” <span
id="fr_3375"></span>[3376](#fn_3375.md) He gave the gift of the Holy Ghost
to men, because the captives, whom the devil had before carried into
hell through sin, Christ by His resurrection from death recalled to
heaven. He ascended therefore into heaven, not where God the Word had
not been before, for He was always in heaven, and abode in the Father,
but where the Word made flesh had not been seated before. Lastly, since
this entrance within the gates of heaven seemed new to its ministers and
princes, they say to one another, on seeing the nature of flesh
penetrating into the secret recesses of heaven, as David full of the
Holy Ghost, declares, “Lift up your gates, ye princes, and be ye lift up
ye everlasting gates, and the King of glory shall enter in. Who is the
King of glory? The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in
battle.” <span id="fr_3376"></span>[3377](#fn_3376.md) Which words are
spoken not with reference to the power of the divine nature, but with
reference to the novelty of flesh ascending to the right hand of God.
The same David says elsewhere, “God hath ascended jubilantly, and the
Lord with the sound of the trumpet.” <span
id="fr_3377"></span>[3378](#fn_3377.md) For conquerors are wont to return
from battle with the sound of the trumpet. Of Him also it is said, “Who
buildeth up His ascent in heaven.” <span
id="fr_3378"></span>[3379](#fn_3378.md) And again, “Who hath ascended above
the cherubims, flying upon the wings of the winds.” <span
id="fr_3379"></span>[3380](#fn_3379.md)
