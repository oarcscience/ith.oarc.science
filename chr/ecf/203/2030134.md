id="iv.viii.iv.xxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVIII</span>.—*Of the letter
written by Valens to the great Valentinianus about the war, and how he
replied*.

<span id="iv.viii.iv.xxviii-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.iv.xxviii-p2.1"></span>The</span> Lord roused the Goths to
war, and drew on to the Bosphorus him who knew only how to fight against
the pious. Then for the first time the vain man became aware of his own
weakness, and sent to his brother to ask for troops. But Valentinian
replied that it were impious to help one fighting against God, and right
rather to check his rashness. By this the unhappy man was filled with
yet greater infatuation, yet he did not withdraw from his rash
undertaking, <span id="page_130">p. 130</span> <span
id="iv.viii.iv.xxviii-Page_130"></span>and persisted in ranging himself
against the truth. <span id="fr_800"></span>[801](#fn_800.md)

<span id="iv.viii.iv.xxviii-p3"></span> On this Valesius remarks that
Valentinian was already dead (†375) when the Goths crossed the Danube
and ravaged Thrace (376). Theodoretus should have written “Gratianus”
for “Valentinianus,” and “nephew” for “brother.”
