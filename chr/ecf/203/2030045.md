<span id="iv.viii.i.xxv-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.i.xxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIV</span>.—*Letter written by
the Emperor Constantine to Sapor* <span
id="fr_418"></span>[419](#fn_418) *, the King of Persia, respecting the
Christians*.

<span id="iv.viii.i.xxv-p3"></span>“<span class="c14"><span
id="iv.viii.i.xxv-p3.1"></span>In</span> protecting the holy faith I
enjoy the light of truth, and by following the light of truth I attain
to fuller knowledge of the faith. Therefore, as facts prove, I recognize
that most holy worship as teaching the knowledge of the most holy God.
This service I profess. With the Power of this God for my ally,
beginning at the furthest boundaries of the ocean, I have, one after
another, quickened every part of the world with hope. Now all the
peoples once enslaved by many tyrants, worn by their daily miseries, and
almost extinct, have been kindled to fresh life by receiving the
protection of the State.

<span id="iv.viii.i.xxv-p4"></span>“The God I reverence is He whose
emblem my dedicated troops bear on their shoulders, marching
whithersoever the cause of justice leads them, and rewarding me by their
splendid victories. I confess that I reverence this God with eternal
remembrance. Him, who dwelleth in the highest heavens, I contemplate
with pure and unpolluted mind. On Him I call on bended knees, shunning
all abominable blood, all unseemly and ill-omened odours, all fire of
incantation <span id="fr_419"></span>[420](#fn_419) , and all pollution
by which unlawful and shameful error has destroyed whole nations and
hurled them down to hell.

<span id="iv.viii.i.xxv-p6"></span>“God does not permit those gifts
which, in His beneficent Providence, He has bestowed <span
id="page_60">p. 60</span> <span id="iv.viii.i.xxv-Page_60"></span>upon
men for the supply of their wants to be perverted according to every
man’s desire. He only requires of men a pure mind and a spotless soul,
and by these He weighs their deeds of virtue and piety. He is pleased
with gentleness <span id="fr_420"></span>[421](#fn_420) and modesty; He
loves the meek <span id="fr_421"></span>[422](#fn_421) , and hates those
who excite contentions; He loves faith, chastises unbelief; He breaks
all power of boasting <span id="fr_422"></span>[423](#fn_422) , and
punishes the insolence of the proud <span
id="fr_423"></span>[424](#fn_423) . Men exalted with pride He utterly
overthrows, and rewards the humble <span
id="fr_424"></span>[425](#fn_424) and the patient <span
id="fr_425"></span>[426](#fn_425) according to their deserts. Of a just
sovereignty He maketh much, strengthens it by His aid, and guards the
counsels of Princes with the blessing of peace.

<span id="iv.viii.i.xxv-p13"></span>“I know that I am not in error, my
brother, when I confess that this God is the Ruler and the Father of all
men, a truth which many who preceded me upon the imperial throne were so
deluded by error as to attempt to deny. But their end was so dreadful
that they have become a fearful warning to all mankind, to deter others
from similar iniquity <span id="fr_426"></span>[427](#fn_426) . Of these
I count that man one whom the wrath of God, like a thunderbolt, drove
hence into your country, and who made notorious the memorial of his
shame which exists in your own land <span
id="fr_427"></span>[428](#fn_427) . Indeed it appears to have been well
ordered that the age in which we live should be distinguished by the
open and manifest punishments inflicted on such persons. I myself have
witnessed the end of those who have persecuted the people of God by
unlawful edicts. Hence it is that I more especially thank God for having
now, by His special Providence, restored peace to those who observe His
law, in which they exalt and rejoice.

<span id="iv.viii.i.xxv-p16"></span>“I am led to expect future happiness
and security whenever God in His goodness unites all men in the exercise
of the one pure and true religion. You may therefore well understand how
exceedingly I rejoice to hear that the finest provinces of Persia are
adorned abundantly with men of this class; I mean Christians; for it is
of them I am speaking. All then is well with you and with them, for you
will have the Lord of all merciful and beneficent to you. Since then you
are so mighty and so pious, I commend the Christians to your care, and
leave them in your protection. Treat them, I beseech you, with the
affection that befits your goodness. Your fidelity in this respect will
confer on yourself and on us inexpressible benefits.”

<span id="iv.viii.i.xxv-p17"></span>This excellent emperor felt so much
solicitude for all who had embraced the true religion, that he not only
watched over those who were his own subjects, but also over the subjects
of other sovereigns. For this reason he was blessed with the special
protection of God, so that although he held the reins of the whole of
Europe and of Africa, and the greater part of Asia, his subjects were
all well disposed to his rule, and obedient to his government. Foreign
nations submitted to his sway, some by voluntary submission, others
overcome in war. Trophies were everywhere erected, and the emperor was
styled Victorious.

<span id="iv.viii.i.xxv-p18"></span>The praises of Constantine have,
however, been proclaimed by many other writers. We must resume the
thread of our history. This emperor, who deserves the highest fame,
devoted his whole mind to matters worthy of the apostles, while men who
had been admitted to the sacerdotal dignity not only neglected to edify
the church, but endeavoured to uproot it from the very foundations. They
invented all manner of false accusations against those who governed the
church in accordance with the doctrines taught by the apostles, and did
their best to depose and banish them. Their envy was not satisfied by
the infamous falsehood which they had invented against Eustathius, but
they had recourse to every artifice to effect the overthrow of another
great bulwark of religion. These tragic occurrences I shall now relate
as concisely as possible.

<span id="iv.viii.i.xxv-p14"></span> The imperial writer may have had in
his mind Tiberius, whose miserable old age was probably ended by murder;
Caius, stabbed by his own guard; Claudius, poisoned by his wife; Nero,
driven to shameful suicide; Vitellius, beaten to death by a brutal mob;
Domitian, assassinated by his wife and freedmen; Commodus, murdered by
his courtiers, and Pertinax by his guards; Caracalla, murdered;
Heliogabalus, murdered; Alexander Severus, Maximinus, Gordianus,
murdered; Decius, killed in war; Gallus, Æmilianus, Gallienus, all
murdered; Aurelianus, Probus, Carus, murdered. On the other hand Trajan,
Marcus Aurelius, and Diocletian, who persecuted the Church with less or
more severity, died peaceful deaths.

<span id="fn_427"></span>[60:428](2030045.htm#fr_427) <span

<span id="iv.viii.i.xxv-p15"></span> Valerianus, proclaimed Emperor in
Rhœtia, <span class="c14"><span
id="iv.viii.i.xxv-p15.1"></span>a.d.</span> 254, was defeated in his
campaign against the Persians, and treated with indignity alive and
dead. After being made to crouch as a footstool for his conqueror to
tread on when mounting on horseback, he was flayed alive, <span
class="c14"><span id="iv.viii.i.xxv-p15.2"></span>a.d.</span> 260, and
his tanned skin nailed in a Persian temple as a “memorial of his shame.”
Cf. Const. Orat. xxiv. Gibbon’s catholic scepticism includes the
humiliation of Valerianus. “The tale,” he says, “is moral and pathetic,
but the truth of it may very fairly be called in question.” (Decline and
Fall, Chap. X.). But the passage in the text, in which the allusion has
not always been perceived, and the parallel reference in the Emperor’s
oration, indicate the belief of a time little more than half a century
after the event. Lactantius (de Morte Persecutorum V.), was probably
about ten years old when Valerianus was defeated, and, if so, gives the
testimony of a contemporary. Orosius (vii. 22) and Agathias (iv. p. 133)
would only copy earlier writers, but the latter states that for the fact
of Sapor’s thus treating Valerianus there is “abundant historical
testimony.” Cf. Tillemont, Hist. Emp. iii. pp. 314, 315.
