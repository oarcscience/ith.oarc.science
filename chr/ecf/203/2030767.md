<span id="vi.xii.i.xxix-p1"></span> 28. The sixth and last point which I
am told that he brings against me (that is if my brother has not left
anything unreported) is that, in the interpretation of the Apostle’s
<span id="page_497">p. 497</span> <span
id="vi.xii.i.xxix-Page_497"></span>words, <span
id="fr_3052"></span>[3053](#fn_3052.md) “He that loveth his wife loveth
himself, for no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourisheth and
cherisheth it, even as Christ also the church,” after my own simple
explanation I propounded the question raised by Origen, speaking his
views though without mentioning his name, and saying:

<span id="vi.xii.i.xxix-p3"></span>“I may be met by the objection that
the statement of the Apostle is not true when he says that no man hates
his own flesh, since those who labour under the jaundice or consumption
or cancer or abscesses, prefer death to life, and hate their own
bodies;” and my own opinion follows immediately: “The words, therefore,
may be more properly taken in a metaphorical sense.”

<span id="vi.xii.i.xxix-p4"></span>When I say metaphorical, I mean to
shew that what is said is not actually the case, but that the truth is
shadowed forth through a mist of allegory. However, I will set out the
actual words which are found in Origen’s third book: “We may say that
the soul loves that flesh which is to see the salvation of God, that it
nourishes and cherishes it, and trains it by discipline and satisfies it
with the bread of heaven, and gives it to drink of the blood of Christ:
so that it may become well-liking through wholesome food, and may follow
its husband freely, without being weighed down by any weakness. It is by
a beautiful image that the soul is said to nourish and cherish the body
as Christ nourishes and cherishes the church, since it was he who said
to Jerusalem: <span id="fr_3053"></span>[3054](#fn_3053.md)

<span id="vi.xii.i.xxix-p6"></span>“How often would I have gathered thy
children together as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings and
thou wouldst not;” and that thus this corruptible may put on
incorruption, and that being poised lightly, as upon wings, may rise
more easily into the air. Let us men then cherish our wives, and let our
souls cherish our bodies in a way as that wives may be turned into men
and bodies into spirits, and that there may be no difference of sex, but
that, as among the angels there is neither male nor female, so we, who
are to be the Angels, may begin to be here what it is promised that we
shall be in heaven.”
