<span id="iv.x.cxlii-p1"></span> *CXLI. To Marcellus, Archimandrite of
the Acoemetæ.* <span id="fr_1988"></span>[1989](#fn_1988.md)

<span id="iv.x.cxlii-p8"></span>Bright is made your holiness by your
goodly life, exhibiting on earth the image of the conversation of the
angels, but it is made still brighter by your zeal for the apostolic
faith. As keel to boat, as corner-stone to house, so to them that choose
to live in piety is the truth of the doctrines of the Gospel. For this
truth when assailed you have bravely fought, not striving to protect it
as though it were weak, but shewing your godly disposition; for the
teaching of our Master Christ is gifted with stability and strength, in
accordance with the promise of the same Saviour, “that the gates of hell
shall not prevail against it.” <span
id="fr_1989"></span>[1990](#fn_1989.md) It is the loving and bountiful Lord
who has thought right that I too should be dishonoured and slain on
behalf of this doctrine. For truly we have reckoned dishonour honour,
and death life. We have heard the words of the apostle “For unto us it
is given by God not only to believe on Him, but also to suffer for His
sake.” <span id="fr_1990"></span>[1991](#fn_1990.md) But the Lord arose
like the sleeper, and stopped the mouths of them that uttered blasphemy
against God and injustice against me. But He has made the tongues of the
pious pour forth their fountains in their wonted message. I, however, am
gathering the delightful fruits of rest; as I look at the agitation of
the churches I am grieved, but I rejoice and am glad at being freed from
cares. I have ever been gratified at your admirable piety, but
heretofore I have not written, not from any lack of regard for the
dictates of charity, but because I have waited for some suitable
occasion. Just now, having fallen in with the most pious and prudent
monks who have been sent by your holiness on other business, I have lost
no time in carrying out my wish. I salute your godliness. I beg you in
the first place to support me with your prayers, and further to cheer me
by a letter, for by God’s grace I have been attacked for the Gospel’s
sake.

<span id="iv.x.cxlii-p2"></span> The Acoemetæ, “sleepless,” or
“unresting,” were an order of monks established in the 5th century by
Alexander, an officer of the imperial household. Marcellus, the third
Abbot, was a second founder, and was warmly supported by the patriarch
Gennadius of Constantinople. (458–71.) Before Chalcedon he joined with
other orthodox abbots to petition Marcian against Eutyches. (Labbe iv.
531 Dict. Christ. Biog. iii. 813). Alexander’s foundation was of 300
monks of various nations, divided into six choirs, and so arranged that
the work of praise and prayer should “never rest.” This has been copied
elsewhere and since,
