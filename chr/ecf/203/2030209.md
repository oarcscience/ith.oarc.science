<span id="iv.x.xx-p1"></span> *XX. To the Presbyter Martyrius.*

<span id="iv.x.xx-p2"></span>Natural disposition appears in us before
resolution of character, and, in this sense, takes the lead; but
disposition is overcome by resolution, as is plainly proved by the right
eloquent orator Athanasius. Though an Egyptian by birth, he has none of
the Egyptian want of self-control, but shews a character tempered by
gentleness. <span id="fr_1647"></span>[1648](#fn_1647) He is moreover a
warm lover of divine things. On this account he has spent many days with
me, expecting to reap some benefit from his stay. But I, as you know,
most God-beloved friend, shrink from trying so to derive good from
others, and am far from being able to impart it to those who seek it,
and this not because I grudge, but because I have not the wherewithal,
to give. Wherefore let your holiness pray that what is said of me may be
confirmed by fact, and that not only may good things be reported of me
by word, but proved in deed.
