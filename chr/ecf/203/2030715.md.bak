<span id="vi.xi.iii.xxxi-p1"></span> 27. But there is danger of
expanding my treatise too far and becoming burdensome to the reader; it
is sufficient that in the passages I have cited he speaks of Origen as
almost an Apostle and a teacher of the churches, and says that it is not
because of his novel doctrines as the mad dogs pretend that the senate
<span id="page_472">p. 472</span> <span
id="vi.xi.iii.xxxi-Page_472"></span>of Rome is excited against him; that
he follows him because he himself and all the wise approve him; and all
the other testimonies, adduced from his prefaces which are inserted
above. But, however these matters may stand, and whatever your relations
may be to these writers whether ancient or modern, and whether you call
them Apostles or mere wantons, <span

is that to me? It is for you to do penance for all your changes of
opinion, your violent words and the wounds you have inflicted on good
men, whether you have yet done so or not. As for myself, what is the
meaning of your saying “If they have followed me when I erred, let them
follow me also in my amendment?” Get thee behind me! Far be such a thing
from me. I never followed you or any other man in your errors, but in
the strength of Christ I will follow, not you nor any other man, but the
Catholic church. But you, who have written all these things who have
followed those whom you knew to be in error, you who, as I have shewn,
have written so unworthily of God, go you, I say, and do penance, if at
least you have any hope that your crime of blasphemy can be pardoned.
