<span id="v.iii.cxix-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="v.iii.cxix-p2.1"></span>Gregory</span>, <span
id="fr_2549"></span>[2550](#fn_2549) bishop of Nazianzen, a most
eloquent man, and my instructor in the Scriptures, composed works,
amounting in all to thirty thousand lines, among which are *On the death
of his brother Cæsarius, On charity, In praise of the Maccabees, In
praise of Cyprian, In praise of Athanasius, In praise of Maximus the
philosopher* after he had returned from exile. This latter however, some
superscribe with the pseudonym of Herona, since there is another work by
Gregory, upbraiding this same Maximus, as if one might not praise and
upbraid the same person at one time or another as the occasion may
demand. Other works of his are a book in hexameter, containing, *A
discussion between virginity and marriage,* two books *Against
Eunomius,* one book *On the Holy Spirit,* and one *Against the Emperor
Julian.* He was a follower of Polemon in his style of speaking. Having
ordained his successor in the bishopric, during his own life time, he
retired to the country where he lived the life of a monk and died, three
years or more ago, in the reign of Theodosius.
