Solomon gave three books to the Churches, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes,
Canticles. These comprise the books of the Old Testament.

Matthew, Mark, Luke, John; the Acts of the Apostles, written by Luke;
fourteen Epistles of the Apostle Paul, two of the Apostle Peter, one of
James, brother of the Lord and Apostle, one of Jude, three of John, the
