<span id="vi.xiii.i-p1"></span> <span class="c21"><span
id="vi.xiii.i-p1.1"></span>A Commentary on the Apostles’ Creed.</span>

<span id="vi.xiii.i-p2"></span>————————————

<span id="vi.xiii.i-p3"></span>This exposition of the Creed was made at
the request of Laurentius, a Bishop whose see is unknown, but is
conjectured by Fontanini, in his life of Rufinus, to have been
Concordia, Rufinus’ birthplace.

<span id="vi.xiii.i-p4"></span>Its exact date cannot be fixed; but from
the fact that he says nothing of his difficulty in writing Latin after
being so long in the East, as he does in several of his books, and from
the comparative ease of the style, it is most probable that it was
written in the later years of his sojourn at Aquileia, that is, about
307–309.

<span id="vi.xiii.i-p5"></span>Its value is considerable (1) as bearing
witness to the state of the Creed in local churches at the beginning of
the 5th century, especially their variations. (In the church of
Aquileia, in Jes*u* Christ*o*. Patrem *invisibilem et impassibilem.*
Resurrectio *hujus* carnis); (2) as showing the adaptation of Eastern
ideas to the formation of Western theology; (3) as giving the Canon of
the books of Scripture, and the Apocrypha of both the Old and New
dispensations.

<span id="vi.xiii.i-p6"></span>The exposition is clear and reasonable;
and, with the exception of a very few passages, such as the argument
from the Phœnix for the Virgin Birth of our Lord, is still of use to us.

<span id="vi.xiii.i-p7"></span>We prefix the words of the creed on which
Rufinus makes his commentary.

<span id="vi.xiii.i-p8"></span>It seems desirable to give the original
Latin, as well as the English version of the Creed of Aquileia. The
words or letters which are peculiar to this creed are put in italics.

<span id="vi.xiii.i-p9"></span>1. Credo in Deo Patre omnipotenti
*invisibili et impassibili*

<span id="vi.xiii.i-p10"></span>1. I believe in God the Father Almighty,

Domino nostro;

our Lord;

<span id="vi.xiii.i-p13"></span>3. Qui natus est de Spiritu Sancto ex

<span id="vi.xiii.i-p18"></span>5. He descended to hell; on the third
day he rose again from the dead.

<span id="vi.xiii.i-p19"></span><span id="page_542">p. 542</span> <span
id="vi.xiii.i-Page_542"></span>6. Ascendit in cœlos; sedet ad dexteram
Patris;

<span id="vi.xiii.i-p20"></span>6. He ascended to the heavens; he
sitteth at the right hand of the Father;

<span id="vi.xiii.i-p21"></span>7. Inde venturus est judicare vivos et
mortuos;

<span id="vi.xiii.i-p22"></span>7. Thence he is to come to judge the
quick and the dead.

<span id="vi.xiii.i-p23"></span>8. Et in Spiritu Sancto;

<span id="vi.xiii.i-p24"></span>8. And in the Holy Ghost;

<span id="vi.xiii.i-p25"></span>9. Sanctam Ecclesiam;
