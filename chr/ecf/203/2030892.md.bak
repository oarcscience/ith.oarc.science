<span id="vi.xiii.xliv"></span>

<span id="vi.xiii.xliv-p1"></span> 43. But let us endeavour to assist
those souls which fail in their faith through reasons drawn from nature.
If one should mix different sorts of seeds together and sow them
indiscriminately in the earth, will not the grain of each several kind,
wherever it may have been thrown, shoot forth at the proper time in
accordance with its own specific nature so as to reproduce the condition
of its own form and its own body.

<span id="vi.xiii.xliv-p2"></span>Thus then the substance of each
individual flesh, though its particles have been variously and diversely
scattered, has within it an immortal principle, since it is the flesh of
an immortal soul, and at the time which God in His good pleasure shall
appoint, there will be collected from the earth and drawn to it, its own
component particles, which will be restored to that form which death had
formerly dissolved. And thus it will come to pass that to each soul will
be restored, not a confused or foreign body but its own which it had
when alive, in order that the flesh together with its own soul may for
the conflicts of the present life either be crowned if undefiled, or
punished if defiled. And accordingly our Church, <span
id="fr_3414"></span>[3415](#fn_3414.md) in teaching the faith instead of
“the Resurrection of the flesh,” as the Creed is delivered in other
Churches, guardedly adds the pronoun “this”—“the resurrection of *this*
flesh.” “Of this,” that is, no doubt, of the person who rehearses the
Creed, making the sign of the cross upon his forehead, while he says the
word, that each believer may know that his flesh, if he have kept it
clean from sin, will be a vessel of honour, useful to the Lord, prepared
for every good work; but, if defiled by sins, that it will be a vessel
of wrath destined to destruction.

<span id="vi.xiii.xliv-p4"></span><span id="page_561">p. 561</span>
<span id="vi.xiii.xliv-Page_561"></span>But now, concerning the glory of
the resurrection and the greatness of the promise by which God has bound
Himself, if any one desires to be more fully informed, he will find
notices in almost all the divine volumes, out of which, simply by way of
bringing them to remembrance, we will mention a few passages in the
present place, and then make an end of the work which you have enjoined.
The Apostle Paul makes use of such arguments as the following in
asserting that mortal flesh will rise again. “But if there be no
resurrection of the dead, then is not Christ risen. And if Christ be not
risen, our preaching is vain and your faith is vain.” <span
id="fr_3415"></span>[3416](#fn_3415.md) And presently afterwards, “But now
is Christ risen from the dead, the first-fruits of them that sleep. For
since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead.
For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. But
every man in his own order. Christ the first-fruits, afterwards they
that are Christ’s at His coming, then cometh the end.” <span
id="fr_3416"></span>[3417](#fn_3416.md) And afterways he adds, “Behold I
shew you a mystery: We shall all rise indeed, but we shall not <span
id="fr_3417"></span>[3418](#fn_3417.md) all be changed;” or as other copies
read, “We shall all sleep, indeed but we shall not all be changed; in a
moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump; for the trumpet
shall sound, and the dead shall rise incorruptible, and we shall be
changed.” <span id="fr_3418"></span>[3419](#fn_3418.md) However, whichever
be the true text, writing to the Thessalonians, he says, “I would not
have you ignorant, brethren, concerning those who are asleep, that ye
sorrow not, as the others who have no hope. For if we believe that Jesus
died and rose again, so those also who sleep through Jesus shall God
bring with Him. For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that
we who are alive and remain at the coming of the Lord shall not prevent
them that sleep. For the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a
shout, with the voice of the archangel, with the trump of God, and the
dead who are in Christ shall rise first: then we who are alive and
remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet
Christ in the air, and so shall we ever be with the Lord.” <span
