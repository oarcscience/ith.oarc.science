id="fr_2439"></span>[2440](#fn_2439) a philosopher of the stoic school,
according to some old Alexandrian custom, where, from the time of <span
id="fr_2440"></span>[2441](#fn_2440) Mark the evangelist the
ecclesiastics were always doctors, was of so great prudence and
erudition both in scripture and secular literature that, on the request
of the legates of that nation, he was sent to India by Demetrius bishop
of Alexandria, where he found that Bartholomew, one of the twelve
apostles, had preached the advent of the Lord Jesus according to the
gospel of Matthew, and on his return to Alexandria he brought this with
him written in Hebrew characters. Many of his commentaries on Holy
Scripture are indeed extant, but his living voice was of still greater
benefit to the churches. He taught in the reigns of the emperor Severus
and Antoninus surnamed Caracalla.
