<span id="iv.viii.iv.xxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.iv.xxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVI</span>.—*Of Didymus of
Alexandria and Ephraim the Syrian*.

<span id="iv.viii.iv.xxvi-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.iv.xxvi-p2.1"></span>At</span> that period at Edessa
flourished the admirable Ephraim, and at Alexandria Didymus, <span
id="fr_791"></span>[792](#fn_791) both writers against the doctrines
that are at variance with the truth. Ephraim, employing the Syrian
language, shed beams of spiritual grace. Totally untainted as he was by
heathen education <span id="fr_792"></span>[793](#fn_792) he was able to
expose the niceties of heathen error, and lay bare the weakness of all
heretical artifices. Harmonius <span id="fr_793"></span>[794](#fn_793)
the son of Bardesanes <span id="fr_794"></span>[795](#fn_794) had once
composed certain songs and by mixing sweetness of melody with his
impiety beguiled the hearers, and led them to their destruction. Ephraim
adopted the music of the songs, but set them to piety, and so gave the
hearers at once great delight and a healing medicine. These songs are
still used to enliven the festivals of our victorious martyrs.

<span id="iv.viii.iv.xxvi-p7"></span>Didymus, however, who from a child
had been deprived of the sense of sight, had been educated in poetry,
rhetoric, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, the logic of Aristotle, and
the eloquence of Plato. Instruction in all these subjects he received by
the sense of hearing alone,—not indeed as conveying the truth, but as
likely to be weapons for the truth against falsehood. Of holy scriptures
he learnt not only the sound but the sense. So among livers of ascetic
lives and students of virtue, these men at that time were conspicuous.

<span id="iv.viii.iv.xxvi-p3"></span> Flourished c. 309–399. Blind from
the age of four, he educated himself with marvellous patience, and was
placed by Athanasius at the head of the catechetical school of
Alexandria. Jerome called him his teacher and seer and translated his
Treatise on the Holy Spirit. Jer. de Vir. Illust. 109.
