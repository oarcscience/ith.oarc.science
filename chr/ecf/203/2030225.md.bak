<span id="iv.x.xxxvi-p1"></span> *XXXVI. To Pompianus, Bishop of Emesa.*

<span id="iv.x.xxxvi-p2"></span>I know very well that your means are
small and your heart is great, and that in your case generosity is not
prevented by limited resources. I therefore introduce to your holiness
the admirable and excellent Celestinianus, once enjoying much wealth and
prosperity, but now escaped from the hands of the barbarians with
nothing but freedom, and having no means of livelihood except the mercy
of men like your piety. And cares crowd round him, for travelling with
him are his wife, children and servants, whom he has brought with him
from no motives but those of humanity, for he cannot think it right to
dismiss them when they refuse to abandon him. I beg you of your goodness
to make him known to our wealthy citizens, for I think that, after being
informed by your holiness and seeing how soon prosperity may fall away,
they will bethink them of our common humanity, and, in imitation of your
magnanimity, will give him such help as they can.
