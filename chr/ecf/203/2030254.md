<span id="iv.x.lxv-p1"></span> *LXV. To the General Zeno.* <span
id="fr_1710"></span>[1711](#fn_1710)

<span id="iv.x.lxv-p3"></span>To be smitten by human ills is the common
lot of all men; to endure them bravely and rise superior to their attack
is no longer common. The former is of human nature; the latter depends
upon resolution. It is on this account that we wonder how the
philosophers resolved on the noblest course of life and conquered their
calamities by wisdom. And philosophy is produced by our reason’s power,
which rules our passions and is not led to and fro by them. Now one of
human ills is grief, and it is this which we exhort your excellency to
overcome, and it will not be difficult for you to rise victorious over
this feeling, if you consider human nature, and take to heart the
uselessness of sorrow. For what gain will it be to the departed that we
should wail and lament? When, however, we reflect upon the common birth,
the long years of intercourse, the splendid service in the field, and
the far-famed achievements, let us reflect that he who was adorned by
them was a man subject to the law of death; that moreover all things are
ordained by God, who guides the affairs of men in accordance with His
sacred knowledge of what will be for their good. Thus have I written so
far as the limits of a letter would allow me, beseeching your eminence
for all our sakes to preserve your health, which is wont to be
maintained by cheerfulness and ruined by despondency. Wherefore in my
care for the advantage of us all I have penned this letter.
