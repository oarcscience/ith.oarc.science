<span id="vi.xii.i.xiv-p1"></span> 13. I am told, further, that you
touch with some critical sharpness upon some points of my letter, and,
with the well-known wrinkles rising on your forehead and your eyebrows
knitted, make sport of me with a wit worthy of Plautus, for having said
that I had a Jew named Barabbas for my teacher. I do not wonder at your
writing Barabbas for Baranina, the letters of the names being somewhat
similar, when you allow yourself such a license in changing the names
themselves, as to turn Eusebius into Pamphilus, and a heretic into a
martyr. One must be cautious of such a man as you, and give you a wide
berth; otherwise I may find my own name turned in a trice, and without
my knowing it, from Jerome to Sardanapalus. Listen, then, O pillar of
wisdom, and type of Catonian severity. I never spoke of him as my
master; I merely wished to illustrate my method of studying the Holy
Scriptures by saying that I had read Origen just in the same way as I
had taken lessons from this Jew. Did I do you an injury because I
attended the lectures of Apollinarius and Didymus rather than yours? Was
there anything to prevent my naming in my letter that most eloquent man
Gregory? <span id="fr_3024"></span>[3025](#fn_3024.md) Which of all the
Latins is his equal? I may well glory and exult in him. But I only
mentioned those who were subject to censure, so as to show that I only
read Origen as I had listened to them, that is, not on account of his
soundness in the faith but on account of the excellence of his learning.
Origen himself, and Clement and Eusebius, and <span id="page_490">p.
490</span> <span id="vi.xii.i.xiv-Page_490"></span>many others, when
they are discussing scriptural points, and wish to have Jewish authority
for what they say, write: “A Hebrew stated this to me,” or “I heard from
a Hebrew,” or, “That is the opinion of the Hebrews.” Origen certainly
speaks of the Patriarch Huillus who was his contemporary, and in the
conclusion of his thirtieth Tome on Isaiah (that in the end of which he
explains the words <span id="fr_3025"></span>[3026](#fn_3025.md) “Woe to
Ariel which David took by storm”) uses his exposition of the words, and
confesses that he had adopted through his teaching a truer opinion than
that which he had previously held. He also takes as written by Moses not
only the eighty-ninth Psalm <span id="fr_3026"></span>[3027](#fn_3026.md)
which is entitled “A prayer of Moses the Man of God,” but also the
eleven following Psalms which have no title according to Huillus’s
opinion; and he makes no scruple of inserting in his commentaries on the
Hebrew Scriptures the views of the Hebrew teachers.
