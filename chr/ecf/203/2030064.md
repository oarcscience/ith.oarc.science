<span id="iv.viii.ii.x-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.ii.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter X</span>.—*Third exile and flight
of Athanasius*.

<span id="iv.viii.ii.x-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.ii.x-p2.1"></span>Those</span> who had obtained entire
ascendency over the mind of Constantius, and influenced him as they
pleased, reminded him that Athanasius had been the cause of the
differences between his brother and himself, which had nearly led to the
rupture of the bonds of nature, and the kindling of a civil war.
Constantius was induced by these representations not only to banish, but
also to condemn the holy Athanasius to death; and he accordingly
despatched Sebastianus <span id="fr_505"></span>[506](#fn_505.md) , a
military commander, with a very large body of soldiery to slay him, as
if he had been a criminal. How the one led the attack and the other
escaped will be best told in the words of him who so suffered and was so
wonderfully saved.

<span id="iv.viii.ii.x-p4"></span>Thus Athanasius writes in his Apology
for his Flight:—“Let the circumstances of my retreat be investigated,
and the testimony of the opposite faction be collected; for Arians
accompanied the soldiers, as well for the purpose of spurring them on,
as of pointing me out to those who did not know me. If they are not
touched with sympathy at the tale I tell, at least let them listen in
the silence of shame. It was night, and some of the people were keeping
vigil, for a communion <span id="fr_506"></span>[507](#fn_506.md) was
expected. A body of soldiers suddenly advanced upon them, consisting of
a general <span id="fr_507"></span>[508](#fn_507.md) and five thousand
armed men with naked swords, bows and arrows, and clubs, as I have
already stated. The general surrounded the church, posting his men in
close order, that those within might be prevented from going out. I
deemed that I ought not in such a time of confusion to leave the people,
but that I ought rather to be the first to meet the danger; so I sat
down on my throne and desired the deacon to read a psalm, and the people
to respond, ‘For His mercy endureth for ever.’ Then I bade them all
return to their own houses. But now the general with the soldiery forced
his way into the church, and surrounded the sanctuary in order to arrest
me. The clergy and the laity who had remained clamorously besought me to
withdraw. This I firmly refused to do until all the others had
retreated. I rose, had a prayer offered, and directed all the people to
retire. ‘It is better,’ said I, ‘for me to meet the danger alone, than
for any of you <span id="page_75">p. 75</span> <span
id="iv.viii.ii.x-Page_75"></span>to be hurt.’ When the greater number of
the people had left the church, and just as the rest were following, the
monks and some of the clergy who had remained came up and drew me out.
And so, may the truth be my witness, the Lord leading and protecting me,
we passed through the midst of the soldiers, some of whom were stationed
around the sanctuary, and others marching about the church. Thus I went
out unperceived, and fervently thanked God that I had not abandoned the
people, but that after they had been sent away in safety, I had been
enabled to escape from the hands of those who sought my life <span
id="fr_508"></span>[509](#fn_508.md) .”
