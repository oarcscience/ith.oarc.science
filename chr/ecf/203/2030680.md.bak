<span id="vi.xi.ii.xliii-p1"></span> 41. You see how he represents these
opinions as things which are held as a kind of esoteric mystery by
certain persons, of whom, however, he is one, as we have shewn over and
over again: only, he uses this figure of speech so that he may escape
the imputations attached to this mystic gnosis. You see, he will tell
us, how the matter stands. You would never think of attributing to me
the opinion that all things are eventually to be restored to one
condition, and to be made up again into one body. I beg you not to
impute this to me. If I say that an opinion is another man’s, let it be
another’s; if you afterwards find any opinion written down without any
‘other’ person being thrown in, you will be right in ascribing it to me.
What then? are we to lose the fruit of all the trouble we have taken
further back on this point? Such is the power of effrontery. However,
let it be as he chooses; I put aside the truth of the matter and accept
his own terms; but he will still be convicted. I will refer on the
matter now in hand to the second book of these Commentaries, at the
passage <span id="fr_2909"></span>[2910](#fn_2909.md) “Giving diligence to
keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. There is one body and
one spirit, even as ye were called in one hope of your calling.” After
several remarks, he proceeds:

<span id="vi.xi.ii.xliii-p3"></span>“The question arises how there can
be one hope of our calling, when in the Father’s house there are many
mansions: to which we reply that the kingdom of heaven is the one hope
of our calling, as being the one house of our Father’s but that in one
house there are many mansions or rooms. For there is one glory of the
sun, another of the moon, another of the stars. But certainly it is
possible that there is a deeper meaning, namely, that in the
consummation of the world, all things are to be restored to their
primitive condition, and that then we shall all be made one body, and
formed anew into the perfect man, and that thus the Saviour’s Prayer
will be fulfilled in us, <span id="fr_2910"></span>[2911](#fn_2910.md)
‘Father, grant that, as thou and I are one, so they also may be one in
us.’”
