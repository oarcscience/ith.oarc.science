<span id="iv.viii.i.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.i.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II.—</span>*List of the Principal
Bishops*

<span id="iv.viii.i.iii-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.i.iii-p2.1"></span>Of</span> the church of Rome at this
period Silvester <span id="fr_244"></span>[245](#fn_244) held the reins.
His predecessor in the see was Miltiades <span
id="fr_245"></span>[246](#fn_245) , the successor of that
Marcellinus <span id="fr_246"></span>[247](#fn_246) who had so nobly
distinguished himself during the persecution.

<span id="iv.viii.i.iii-p6"></span>In Antioch, after the death of
Tyrannus <span id="fr_247"></span>[248](#fn_247) , when peace began to
be restored to the churches, Vitalis <span
id="fr_248"></span>[249](#fn_248) received the chief authority, and
restored the church in the “Palæa <span
id="fr_249"></span>[250](#fn_249) ” which had been destroyed by the
tyrants. He was succeeded by Philogonius <span
id="fr_250"></span>[251](#fn_250) , who completed all that was wanting
in the work of restoration: he had, during the time of Licinius,
signalised himself by his zeal for religion.

<span id="iv.viii.i.iii-p11"></span>After the administration of
Hermon <span id="fr_251"></span>[252](#fn_251) , the government of the
church in Jerusalem was committed to Macarius <span
id="fr_252"></span>[253](#fn_252) , a man whose character was equal to
his name, and whose mind was adorned by every kind of virtue.

<span id="iv.viii.i.iii-p14"></span>At this same period also, Alexander,
illustrious for his apostolical gifts, governed the church of
Constantinople <span id="fr_253"></span>[254](#fn_253) .

<span id="iv.viii.i.iii-p16"></span>It was at this time that Alexander,
bishop of Alexandria, perceiving that Arius, enslaved by the lust of
power, was assembling those who had been taken captive by his
blasphemous doctrines, and was holding private meetings, communicated an
account of his heresy by letter to the rulers of the principal churches.
That the authenticity of my history may not be suspected, I shall now
insert in my narrative the letter which he wrote to his namesake,
containing, as it does, a clear account of all the facts I have
mentioned. I shall also subjoin the letter of Arius, together with the
other letters which are necessary to the completeness of this narrative,
that they may at once testify to the truth of my work, and make the
course of events more clear.

<span id="iv.viii.i.iii-p17"></span>The following letter was written by
Alexander of Alexandria, to the bishop of the same name as himself.
