<span id="iv.viii.i.iv-p1"></span> <span id="page_35">p. 35</span> <span
id="iv.viii.i.iv-Page_35"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.i.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter III</span>.—*The Epistle of
Alexander, Bishop of Alexandria to Alexander, Bishop of Constantinople*.

<span id="iv.viii.i.iv-p2"></span>“<span class="c14"><span
id="iv.viii.i.iv-p2.1"></span>To</span> his most revered and likeminded
brother Alexander, Alexander sendeth greeting in the Lord.

<span id="iv.viii.i.iv-p3"></span>“Impelled by avarice and ambition,
evil-minded persons have ever plotted against the wellbeing of the most
important dioceses. Under various pretexts, they attack the religion of
the Church; and, being maddened by the devil, who works in them, they
start aside from all piety according to their own pleasure, and trample
under foot the fear of the judgment of God. Suffering as I do from them
myself, I deem it necessary to inform your piety, that you may be on
your guard against them, lest they or any of their party should presume
to enter your diocese (for these cheats are skilful in deception), or
should circulate false and specious letters, calculated to delude one
who has devoted himself to the simple and undefiled faith.

<span id="iv.viii.i.iv-p4"></span>“Arius and Achillas have lately formed
a conspiracy, and, emulating the ambition of Colluthus, have gone far
beyond him <span id="fr_254"></span>[255](#fn_254.md) . He indeed sought to
find a pretext for his own pernicious line of action in the charges he
brought against them. But they, beholding his making a trade of Christ
for lucre <span id="fr_255"></span>[256](#fn_255.md) , refused to remain
any longer in subjection to the Church; but built for themselves caves,
like robbers, and now constantly assemble in them, and day and night ply
slanders there against Christ and against us. They revile every godly
apostolical doctrine, and in Jewish fashion have organized a gang to
fight against Christ, denying His divinity, and declaring Him to be on a
level with other men. They pick out every passage which refers to the
dispensation of salvation, and to His humiliation for our sake; they
endeavour to collect from them their own impious assertion, while they
evade all those which declare His eternal divinity, and the
unceasing <span id="fr_256"></span>[257](#fn_256.md) glory which He
possesses with the Father. They maintain the ungodly doctrine
entertained by the Greeks and the Jews concerning Jesus Christ; and
thus, by every means in their power, hunt for their applause. Everything
which outsiders ridicule in us they officiously practise. They daily
excite persecutions and seditions against us. On the one hand they bring
accusations against us before the courts, suborning as witnesses certain
unprincipled women whom they have seduced into error. On the other they
dishonour Christianity by permitting their young women to ramble about
the streets. Nay, they have had the audacity to rend the seamless
garment of Christ, which the soldiers dared not divide.

<span id="iv.viii.i.iv-p8"></span>“When these actions, in keeping with
their course of life, and the impious enterprise which had been long
concealed, became tardily known to us, we unanimously ejected them from
the Church which worships the divinity of Christ. They then ran hither
and thither to form cabals against us, even addressing themselves to our
fellow-ministers who were of one mind with us, under the pretence of
seeking peace and unity with them, but in truth endeavouring by means of
fair words, to sweep some among them away into their own disease. They
ask them to write a wordy letter, and then read the contents to those
whom they have deceived, in order that they may not retract, but be
confirmed in their impiety, by finding that bishops agree with and
support their views. They make no acknowledgment of the evil doctrines
and practices for which they have been expelled by us, but they either
impart them without comment, or carry on the deception by fallacies and
forgeries. Thus concealing their destructive doctrine by persuasive and
meanly truckling language, they catch the unwary, and lose no
opportunity of calumniating our religion. Hence it arises that several
have been led to sign their letter, and to receive them into communion,
a proceeding on the part of our fellow-ministers which I consider highly
reprehensible; for they thus not only disobey the apostolical rule, but
even help to inflame their diabolical action against Christ. It is on
this account, beloved brethren, that without delay I have stirred myself
up to inform you of the unbelief of certain persons who say that “There
was a time when the Son of God was not <span
id="fr_257"></span>[258](#fn_257.md) ;” and “He who previously had no
existence subsequently came into existence; and when at some time He
came into existence He became such as every other man is.” God, they
say, created all things out of that which was non-existent, and they
include in the number of creatures, both rational and irrational, even
the Son of God. Consistently with this doctrine they, as a necessary
consequence, affirm that He <span id="page_36">p. 36</span> <span
id="iv.viii.i.iv-Page_36"></span>is by nature liable to change, and
capable both of virtue and of vice, and thus, by their hypothesis of his
having been created out of that which was non-existent, they overthrow
the testimony of the Divine Scriptures, which declare the immutability
of the Word and the Divinity of the Wisdom of the Word, which Word and
Wisdom is Christ. ‘We are also able,’ say these accursed wretches, ‘to
become like Him, the sons of God; for it is written,—*I have nourished
and brought up children* <span id="fr_258"></span>[259](#fn_258.md) .’ When
the continuation of this text is brought before them, which is, ‘*and
they have rebelled against Me,*’ and it is objected that these words are
inconsistent with the Saviour’s nature, which is immutable, they throw
aside all reverence, and affirm that God foreknew and foresaw that His
Son would not rebel against Him, and that He therefore chose Him in
preference to all others. They likewise assert that He was not chosen
because He had by nature any thing superior to the other sons of God;
for no man, say they, is son of God by nature, nor has any peculiar
relation to Him. He was chosen, they allege, because, though mutable by
nature, His painstaking character suffered no deterioration. As though,
forsooth, even if a Paul and a Peter made like endeavours, their sonship
would in no respects differ from His.

<span id="iv.viii.i.iv-p11"></span>“To establish this insane doctrine
they insult the Scriptures, and bring forward what is said in the Psalms
of Christ, ‘*Thou hast loved righteousness and hated iniquity, therefore
thy God hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy
fellows* <span id="fr_259"></span>[260](#fn_259.md) .’ Now that the Son of
God was not created out of the non-existent <span
id="fr_260"></span>[261](#fn_260.md) , and that there never was a time in
which He was not, is expressly taught by John the Evangelist, who speaks
of Him as ‘*the only begotten Son which is in the bosom of the
Father* <span id="fr_261"></span>[262](#fn_261.md) .’ This divine teacher
desired to show that the Father and the Son are inseparable; and,
therefore, he said, ‘that the Son is in the bosom of the Father.’
Moreover, the same John affirms that the Word of God is not classed
among things created out of the non-existent, for, he says that ‘*all
things were made by Him* <span id="fr_262"></span>[263](#fn_262.md) ,’ and
he also declares His individual personality <span
id="fr_263"></span>[264](#fn_263.md) in the following words: ‘*In the
beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was
God.…All things were made by Him, and without Him was not any thing made
that was made* <span id="fr_264"></span>[265](#fn_264.md) .’ If, then, all
things were made by Him, how is it that He who thus bestowed existence
on all, could at any period have had no existence himself? The Word, the
creating power, can in no way be defined as of the same nature as the
things created, if indeed He was in the beginning, and all things were
made by Him, and were called by Him out of the non-existent into being.
‘*That which is* <span id="fr_265"></span>[266](#fn_265.md) *’* must be of
an opposite nature to, and essentially different from, things created
out of the non-existent. This shows, likewise, that there is no
separation between the Father and the Son, and that the idea of
separation cannot even be conceived by the mind; while the fact that the
world was created out of the non-existent involves a later and fresh
genesis of its essential nature <span id="fr_266"></span>[267](#fn_266.md)
, all things having been endowed with such an origin of existence by the
Father through the Son. John, the most pious apostle, perceiving that
the word ‘was’ applied to the Word of God <span
id="fr_267"></span>[268](#fn_267.md) was far beyond and above the
intelligence of created beings, did not presume to speak of His
generation or creation, nor yet dared to name the Maker and the creature
in equivalent syllables. Not that the Son of God is unbegotten, for the
Father alone is unbegotten; but that the ineffable personality of the
only-begotten God <span id="page_37">p. 37</span> <span
id="iv.viii.i.iv-Page_37"></span>is beyond the keenest conception of the
evangelists and perhaps even of angels. Therefore, I do not think men
ought to be considered pious who presume to investigate this subject, in
disobedience to the injunction, ‘*Seek not what is too difficult for
thee, neither enquire into what is too high for thee* <span
id="fr_268"></span>[269](#fn_268.md) .’ For if the knowledge of many other
things incomparably inferior is beyond the capacity of the human mind,
and cannot therefore be attained, as has been said by Paul, ‘*Eye hath
not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the
things which God hath prepared for them that love Him* <span
id="fr_269"></span>[270](#fn_269.md) ,’ and as God also said to Abraham,
that the stars could not be numbered by him <span
id="fr_270"></span>[271](#fn_270.md) ; and it is likewise said, ‘*Who shall
number the grains of sand by the sea-shore, or the drops of rain* <span
id="fr_271"></span>[272](#fn_271.md) ?’ how then can any one but a madman
presume to enquire into the nature of the Word of God? It is said by the
Spirit of prophecy, ‘*Who shall declare His generation* <span
id="fr_272"></span>[273](#fn_272.md) ?’ And, therefore, our Saviour in His
kindness to those men who were the pillars of the whole world, desiring
to relieve them of the burden of striving after this knowledge, told
them that it was beyond their natural comprehension, and that the Father
alone could discern this most divine mystery; ‘*No man,*’ said He,
‘*knoweth the Son but the Father, and no man knoweth the Father save the
Son* <span id="fr_273"></span>[274](#fn_273.md) .’ It was, I think,
concerning this same subject that the Father said, ‘My secret is for Me
and for Mine <span id="fr_274"></span>[275](#fn_274.md) .’

<span id="iv.viii.i.iv-p29"></span>“But the insane folly of imagining
that the Son of God came into being out of that which had no being, and
that His sending forth took place in time, is plain from the words
‘which had no being,’ although the foolish are incapable of perceiving
the folly of their own utterances. For the phrase ‘He was not’ must
either have reference to time, or to some interval in the ages. If then
it be true that all things were made by Him, it is evident that every
age, time, all intervals of time, and that ‘when’ in which ‘was not’ has
its place, were made by Him. And is it not absurd to say that there was
a time when He who created all time, and ages, and seasons, with which
the ‘was not’ is confused, was not? For it would be the height of
ignorance, and contrary indeed to all reason, to affirm that the cause
of any created thing can be posterior to that caused by it. The interval
during which they say the Son was still unbegotten of the Father was,
according to their opinion, prior to the wisdom of God, by whom all
things were created. They thus contradict the Scripture which declares
Him to be ‘the *firstborn of every creature* <span
id="fr_275"></span>[276](#fn_275.md) .’ In consonance with this doctrine,
Paul with his usual mighty voice cries concerning Him; ‘*whom He hath
appointed heir of all things, by whom also He made the worlds* <span
id="fr_276"></span>[277](#fn_276.md) ’ ‘*For by Him were all things created
that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible,
whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all
things were created by Him and for Him: and He is before all
things* <span id="fr_277"></span>[278](#fn_277.md) ’ Since the hypothesis
implied in the phrase ‘out of the non-existent’ is manifestly impious,
it follows that the Father is always Father. And He is Father from the
continual presence of the Son, on account of whom He is called <span
id="fr_278"></span>[279](#fn_278.md) Father. And the Son being ever present
with Him, the Father is ever perfect, wanting in no good thing, for He
did not beget His only Son in time, or in any interval of time, nor out
of that which had no previous existence.

<span id="iv.viii.i.iv-p34"></span>“Is it not then impious to say that
there was a time when the wisdom of God was not? Who saith, ‘*I was by
Him as one brought up with Him: I was daily His delight* <span
id="fr_279"></span>[280](#fn_279.md) ?’ Or that once the power of God was
not, or His Word, or anything else by which the Son is known, or the
Father designated, defective? To assert that the brightness of the
Father’s glory ‘once did not exist,’ destroys also the original light of
which it is the brightness <span id="fr_280"></span>[281](#fn_280.md) ; and
if there ever was a time in which the image of God was not, it is plain
that He Whose image He is, is not always: nay, by the non-existence of
the express image of God’s Person, He also is taken away of whom this is
ever the express image. Hence it may be seen, that the Sonship of our
Saviour has not even anything in common with the sonship of men. For
just as it has been shown that the nature of His existence cannot be
expressed by language, and infinitely surpasses in excellence all things
to which He has given being, so His Sonship, naturally partaking in His
paternal Divinity, is unspeakably different from the sonship of those
who, by His appointment, have been adopted as sons. He is by nature
immutable, perfect, and all-sufficient, whereas men are liable to
change, and need His help. What further advance can be made by the <span
id="page_38">p. 38</span> <span id="iv.viii.i.iv-Page_38"></span>wisdom
of God <span id="fr_281"></span>[282](#fn_281.md) ? What can the Very
Truth, or God the Word, add to itself? How can the Life or the True
Light in any way be bettered? And is it not still more contrary to
nature to suppose that wisdom can be susceptible of folly? that the
power of God can be united with weakness? that reason itself can be
dimmed by unreasonableness, or that darkness can be mixed with the true
light? Does not the Apostle say, ‘*What communion hath light with
darkness? and what concord hath Christ with Belial* <span
id="fr_282"></span>[283](#fn_282.md) ?’ and Solomon, that ‘*the way of a
serpent upon a rock* <span id="fr_283"></span>[284](#fn_283.md) ’ was ‘*too
wonderful*’ for the human mind to comprehend, which ‘rock,’ according to
St. Paul, is Christ <span id="fr_284"></span>[285](#fn_284.md) . Men and
angels, however, who are His creatures, have received His blessing,
enabling them to exercise themselves in virtue and in obedience to His
commands, that thus they may avoid sin. And it is on this account that
our Lord being by nature the Son of the Father, is worshipped by all;
and they who have put off the spirit of bondage, and by brave deeds and
advance in virtue have received the spirit of adoption through the
kindness of Him Who is the Son of God by nature, by adoption also become
sons.

<span id="iv.viii.i.iv-p41"></span>“His true, peculiar, natural, and
special Sonship was declared by Paul, who, speaking of God, says, that
‘*He spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us* <span
id="fr_285"></span>[286](#fn_285.md) ,’ who are not by nature His sons. It
was to distinguish Him from those who are not ‘*His own,*’ that he
called Him ‘*His own son.*’ It is also written in the Gospel, ‘*This is
My beloved Son in whom I am well pleased* <span
id="fr_286"></span>[287](#fn_286.md) ;’ and in the Psalms the Saviour says,
‘*The Lord said unto Me, Thou art My Son* <span
id="fr_287"></span>[288](#fn_287.md) .’ By proclaiming natural sonship He
shows that there are no other natural sons besides Himself.

<span id="iv.viii.i.iv-p45"></span>“And do not these words, I begot thee
‘from the womb before the morning <span
id="fr_288"></span>[289](#fn_288.md) ,’ plainly show the natural sonship of
the paternal birth <span id="fr_289"></span>[290](#fn_289.md) of One whose
lot it is, not from diligence of conduct, or exercise in moral progress,
but by individuality of nature? Hence it ensues that the filiation of
the only-begotten Son of the Father is incapable of fall; while the
adoption of reasonable beings who are not His sons by nature, but merely
on account of fitness of character, and by the bounty of God, may fall
away, as it is written in the word, ‘*The sons of God saw the daughters
of men, and took them as wives,*’ and so forth <span
id="fr_290"></span>[291](#fn_290.md) . And God, speaking by Isaiah, said,
‘*I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled
against Me* <span id="fr_291"></span>[292](#fn_291.md) .’

<span id="iv.viii.i.iv-p50"></span>“I have many things to say, beloved,
but because I fear that I shall cause weariness by further admonishing
teachers who are of one mind with myself, I pass them by. You, having
been taught of God, are not ignorant that the teaching at variance with
the religion of the Church which has just arisen, is the same as that
propagated by Ebion <span id="fr_292"></span>[293](#fn_292.md) and
Artemas <span id="fr_293"></span>[294](#fn_293.md) , and rivals that of
Paul of Samosata, bishop of Antioch, who was excommunicated by a council
of all the bishops. Lucianus <span id="fr_294"></span>[295](#fn_294.md) ,
his successor, withdrew himself from communion with these bishops during
a period of many years.

<span id="iv.viii.i.iv-p54"></span>“And now amongst us there have sprung
up, ‘out of the non-existent’ men who have greedily sucked down the
dregs of this impiety, offsets of the same stock: I mean Arius and
Achillas, and all their gang of rogues. Three bishops <span
id="fr_295"></span>[296](#fn_295.md) of Syria, appointed no one knows how,
by consenting to them, fire them to more fatal heat. I refer their
sentence to your decision. Retaining in their memory all that they can
collect concerning the suffering, humiliation, emptying of Himself <span
id="fr_296"></span>[297](#fn_296.md) , and so-called poverty, and
everything of which the Saviour for our sake accepted the acquired name,
they bring forward those passages to disprove His eternal existence and
divinity, while they forget all those which declare His glory and
nobility and abiding with the Father; as for instance, ‘*I and My father
are one* <span id="fr_297"></span>[298](#fn_297.md) .’ In these words the
Lord does not proclaim Himself to be the Father, neither does He
represent two natures as one; but that the essence of the Son of the
Father preserves accurately the likeness of the Father, His nature
taking off the impress of likeness to Him in all things, being the exact
image of the Father and the express stamp of the prototype. When,
therefore, Philip, desirous of seeing the Father, said to Him, ‘*Lord,
show us the Father,*’ the Lord with abundant plainness said to him, ‘*He
that hath seen Me hath seen the Father* <span
id="fr_298"></span>[299](#fn_298.md) ,’ as though the Father <span
id="page_39">p. 39</span> <span id="iv.viii.i.iv-Page_39"></span>were
beheld in the spotless and living mirror of His image. The same idea is
conveyed in the Psalms, where the saints say, ‘*In Thy light we shall
see light* <span id="fr_299"></span>[300](#fn_299.md) .’ It is on this
account that ‘*he who honoureth the Son, honoureth the Father* <span
id="fr_300"></span>[301](#fn_300.md) .’ And rightly, for every impious word
which men dare to utter against the Son is spoken also against the
Father.

<span id="iv.viii.i.iv-p61"></span>“After this no one can wonder at the
false calumnies which I am about to detail, my beloved brethren,
propagated by them against me, and against our most religious people.
They not only set their battle in array against the divinity of Christ,
but ungratefully insult us. They think it beneath them to be compared
with any of those of old time, nor do they endure to be put on a par
with the teachers we have been conversant with from childhood. They will
not admit that any of our fellow-ministers anywhere possess even
mediocrity of intelligence. They say that they themselves alone are the
wise and the poor, and discoverers of doctrines, and to them alone have
been revealed those truths which, say they, have never entered the mind
of any other individuals under the sun. O what wicked arrogance! O what
excessive folly! What false boasting, joined with madness and Satanic
pride, has hardened their impious hearts! They are not ashamed to oppose
the godly clearness of the ancient scriptures, nor yet does the
unanimous piety of all our fellow-ministers concerning Christ blunt
their audacity. Even devils will not suffer impiety like this; for even
they refrain from speaking blasphemy against the Son of God.

<span id="iv.viii.i.iv-p62"></span>“These then are the questions I have
to raise, according to the ability I possess, with those who from their
rude resources throw dust on the Christ, and try to slander our
reverence for Him. These inventors of silly tales assert that we, who
reject their impious and unscriptural blasphemy concerning the creation
of Christ from the non-existent, teach that there are two unbegotten
Beings. For these ill-instructed men contend that one of these
alternatives must hold; either He must be believed to have come out of
the non-existent, or there are two unbegotten Beings. In their ignorance
and want of practice in theology they do not realize how vast must be
the distance between the Father who is uncreate, and the creatures,
whether rational or irrational, which He created out of the
non-existent; and that the only-begotten nature of Him Who is the Word
of God, by Whom the Father created the universe out of the non-existent,
standing, as it were, in the middle between the two, was begotten of the
self-existent Father, as the Lord Himself testified when He said,
‘*Every one that loveth the Father, loveth also the Son that is begotten
of Him* <span id="fr_301"></span>[302](#fn_301.md) .’

<span id="iv.viii.i.iv-p64"></span>“We believe, as is taught by the
apostolical Church, in an only unbegotten Father, Who of His being hath
no cause, immutable and invariable, and Who subsists always in one state
of being, admitting neither of progression nor of diminution; Who gave
the law, and the prophets, and the gospel; of patriarchs and apostles,
and of all saints, Lord: and in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten
Son of God, begotten not out of that which is not, but of the Father,
Who is; yet not after the manner of material bodies, by severance or
emanation, as Sabellius <span id="fr_302"></span>[303](#fn_302.md) and
Valentinus <span id="fr_303"></span>[304](#fn_303.md) taught; but in an
inexpressible and inexplicable manner, according to the saying which we
quoted above, ‘*Who shall declare His generation* <span
id="fr_304"></span>[305](#fn_304.md) ?’ since no mortal intellect can
comprehend the nature of His Person, as the Father Himself cannot be
comprehended, because the nature of reasonable beings is unable to grasp
the manner in which He was begotten of the Father <span
id="fr_305"></span>[306](#fn_305.md) .

<span id="iv.viii.i.iv-p69"></span>“But those who are led by the Spirit
of truth have no need to learn these things of me, for the words long
since spoken by the Saviour yet sound in our ears, ‘*No one knoweth who
the Father is but the Son, and no one knoweth who the Son is but the
Father* <span id="fr_306"></span>[307](#fn_306.md) .’ We have learnt that
the Son is immutable and unchangeable, all-sufficient and perfect, like
the Father, lacking only His “unbegotten.” He is the exact and precisely
similar image of His Father. For it is clear that the image fully
contains everything by which the greater likeness exists, as the Lord
taught us when He said, ‘*My Father is greater than I* <span
id="fr_307"></span>[308](#fn_307.md) .’ And in accordance with this we
believe that the Son always existed of the Father; for he is the
*brightness of His glory,* and the express *image of His Father’s
Person* <span id="fr_308"></span>[309](#fn_308.md) .” But let no one be led
by the word ‘*always*’ to imagine that the Son is unbegotten, as is
thought by some who have their intellects blinded: for to say that He
was, that He has always been, and that before all ages, is not to say
that He is unbegotten.

<span id="iv.viii.i.iv-p73"></span>“The mind of man could not possibly
invent a term expressive of what is meant by being unbegotten. I believe
that you are of this opinion; and, indeed, I feel confident in your
orthodox view that none of these terms in any way signify the
unbegotten. For all the terms <span id="page_40">p. 40</span> <span
id="iv.viii.i.iv-Page_40"></span>appear to signify merely the extension
of time, and are not adequate to express the divinity and, as it were,
the primæval being of the only-begotten Son. They were used by the holy
men who earnestly endeavoured to clear up the mystery, and who asked
pardon from those who heard them, with a reasonable excuse for their
failure, by saying ‘as far as our comprehension has reached.’ But if
those who allege that what was ‘*known in part*’ has been ‘*done
away* <span id="fr_309"></span>[310](#fn_309.md) ’ for them, expect from
human lips anything beyond human powers, it is plain that the terms
‘was,’ and ‘ever,’ and ‘before all ages,’ fall far short of this
expectation. But whatever they may mean, it is not the same as ‘the
unbegotten.’ Therefore His own individual dignity must be reserved to
the Father as the Unbegotten One, no one being called the cause of His
existence: to the Son likewise must be given the honour which befits
Him, there being to Him a generation from the Father which has no
beginning; we must render Him worship, as we have already said, only
piously and religiously ascribing to Him the ‘was’ and the ‘ever,’ and
the ‘before all ages;’ not however rejecting His divinity, but ascribing
to Him a perfect likeness in all things to His Father, while at the same
time we ascribe to the Father alone His own proper glory of ‘the
unbegotten,’ even as the Saviour Himself says, ‘*My Father is greater
than I* <span id="fr_310"></span>[311](#fn_310.md) .’

<span id="iv.viii.i.iv-p76"></span>“And in addition to this pious belief
respecting the Father and the Son, we confess as the Sacred Scriptures
teach us, one Holy Ghost, who moved the saints of the Old Testament, and
the divine teachers of that which is called the New. We believe in one
only Catholic Church, the apostolical, which cannot be destroyed even
though all the world were to take counsel to fight against it, and which
gains the victory over all the impious attacks of the heterodox; for we
are emboldened by the words of its Master, ‘*Be of good cheer, I have
overcome the world* <span id="fr_311"></span>[312](#fn_311.md) .’ After
this, we receive the doctrine of the resurrection from the dead, of
which Jesus Christ our Lord became the first-fruits; Who bore a Body, in
truth, not in semblance, derived from Mary the mother of God <span
id="fr_312"></span>[313](#fn_312.md) ; in the fulness of time sojourning
among the race, for the remission of sins: who was crucified and died,
yet for all this suffered no diminution of His Godhead. He rose from the
dead, was taken into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of the
Majesty on high.

<span id="iv.viii.i.iv-p79"></span>“In this epistle I have only
mentioned these things in part, deeming it, as I have said, wearisome to
dwell minutely on each article, since they are well known to your pious
diligence. These things we teach, these things we preach; these are the
dogmas of the apostolic Church, for which we are ready to die, caring
little for those who would force us to forswear them; for we will never
relinquish our hope in them, though they should try to compel us by
tortures.

<span id="iv.viii.i.iv-p80"></span>“Arius and Achillas, together with
their fellow foes, have been expelled from the Church, because they have
become aliens from our pious doctrine: according to the blessed Paul,
who said, *‘If any of you preach any other gospel than that which you
have received, let him be accursed, even though he should pretend to be
an angel from heaven* <span id="fr_313"></span>[314](#fn_313.md) , and
‘*But if any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words,
even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is
according to godliness, he is proud, knowing nothing* <span
id="fr_314"></span>[315](#fn_314.md) ,’ and so forth. Since, then, they
have been condemned by the brotherhood, let none of you receive them,
nor attend to what they say or write. They are deceivers, and propagate
lies, and they never adhere to the truth. They go about to different
cities with no other intent than to deliver letters under the pretext of
friendship and in the name of peace, and by hypocrisy and flattery to
obtain other letters in return, in order to deceive a few ‘*silly women
who are laden with sins* <span id="fr_315"></span>[316](#fn_315.md) .’ I
beseech you, beloved brethren, to avoid those who have thus dared to act
against Christ, who have publicly held up the Christian religion to
ridicule, and have eagerly sought to make a display before judicial
tribunals, who have endeavoured to excite a persecution against us at a
period of the most entire peace, and who have enervated the unspeakable
mystery of the generation of Christ. Unite unanimously in opposition to
them, as some of our fellow-ministers have already done, who, being
filled with indignation, wrote to me against them, and signed our
formulary <span id="fr_316"></span>[317](#fn_316.md) .

<span id="iv.viii.i.iv-p85"></span>“I have sent you these letters by my
son Apion, the deacon; being those of (the ministers in) all Egypt and
the Thebaid, also of those of Libya, and the Pentapolis, of Syria,
Lycia, Pamphylia, Asia, Cappadocia, and in the other adjoining
countries. Whose example you likewise, I trust, will follow. Many kindly
attempts have been made by me to gain back those who have been led
astray, but no remedy has proved more efficacious in restoring the laity
who have been deceived by them and leading them to repentance, than
<span id="page_41">p. 41</span> <span
id="iv.viii.i.iv-Page_41"></span>the manifestation of the union of our
fellow-ministers. Salute one another, with the brotherhood that is with
you. I pray that you may be strong in the Lord, my beloved, and that I
may receive the fruit of your love to Christ.

<span id="iv.viii.i.iv-p86"></span>“The following are the name of those
who have been anathematized as heretics: among the presbyters, Arius;
among the deacons, Achillas, Euzoius, Aïthales, Lucius, Sarmates,
Julius, Menas, another Arius, and Helladius.”

<span id="iv.viii.i.iv-p87"></span>Alexander wrote in the same strain to
Philogonius <span id="fr_317"></span>[318](#fn_317.md) , bishop of Antioch,
to Eustathius <span id="fr_318"></span>[319](#fn_318.md) , who then ruled
the church of the Berœans, and to all those who defended the doctrines
of the Apostles. But Arius could not endure to keep quiet, but wrote to
all those whom he believed to agree with him in opinion. His letter to
Eusebius, bishop of Nicomedia, is a clear proof that the divine
Alexander wrote nothing that was false concerning him. I shall here
insert his letter, in order that the names of those who were implicated
in his impiety may become generally known.

<span id="iv.viii.i.iv-p5"></span> Alexander’s words seem to imply that
Colluthus began his schismatical proceedings in assuming to exercise
episcopal functions before the separation of Arius from the Church, and
that one cause of his wrong action was impatience at the mild course at
first adopted by Alexander towards Arius. The Council of Alexandria held
in <span class="c14"><span id="iv.viii.i.iv-p5.1"></span>a.d.</span> 324
under Hosius, decided that he was only a Presbyter.

<span id="iv.viii.i.iv-p19"></span> The history of the word <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.viii.i.iv-p19.1"></span>ὑ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.viii.i.iv-p19.2"></span>πόστασις</span> is of
crucial value in the study of the Arian controversy. Its various usages
may be classified as (i) *Classical;* (ii) *Scriptural;* (iii)
*Ecclesiastical.* The correlative substantive of the verb <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.viii.i.iv-p19.3"></span>ὑ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.viii.i.iv-p19.4"></span>φίστημι</span>, I
make to stand under, \[from <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.viii.i.iv-p19.5"></span>ὑ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.viii.i.iv-p19.6"></span>πό</span> = sub. under, and <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.viii.i.iv-p19.7"></span>ἵ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.viii.i.iv-p19.8"></span>στημι</span>,
\[STA\]; it means primarily *a standing under.* Hence, materially, it
means in (i) Classical Greek, sediment, prop. foundation: substances as
opposed to their reflexions, substantial nature, as of timber \[Theoph.
C. P. 5. 16. 4\]. So naturally grew the signification of ground of hope,
actual existence; and, in the later philosophy, it had come to be
employed instead of <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.viii.i.iv-p19.9"></span>οὐσία</span> for the noetic substratum
“underlying” the phænomena. (ii) Scriptural. In the N.T. it is found
five times, twice in 2 Cor. and thrice in Heb. (<span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.viii.i.iv-p19.10"></span>α</span>) <span
id="iv.viii.i.iv-p19.11"></span>[2 Cor. ix.
4](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#004.md)<span
id="iv.viii.i.iv-p19.12"></span>, and (<span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.viii.i.iv-p19.13"></span>β</span>) [2 Cor.
11.17](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#017.md)<span
id="iv.viii.i.iv-p19.14"></span>. “Confidence” of boasting. (<span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.viii.i.iv-p19.15"></span>γ</span>) <span
id="iv.viii.i.iv-p19.16"></span>[Heb. i.
3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003.md)<span
id="iv.viii.i.iv-p19.17"></span>, <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.viii.i.iv-p19.18"></span>ὁ</span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.viii.i.iv-p19.19"></span>χαρακτὴρ τῆς ὑποστάσεως</span>, A.V. the
express image of His “person.” R.V., the very image of His “substance.”
(<span class="Greek"><span id="iv.viii.i.iv-p19.20"></span>δ</span>)
<span id="iv.viii.i.iv-p19.21"></span>[Heb. iii.
14](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#014.md)<span
id="iv.viii.i.iv-p19.22"></span>, “Confidence”. (ε) <span
id="iv.viii.i.iv-p19.23"></span>[Heb. xi.
1](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#001.md)<span
id="iv.viii.i.iv-p19.24"></span>, A.V. “substance” of things hoped for.
R.V. Assurance of things hoped for. (iii) Ecclesiastical. The earlier
ecclesiastical use, like the later philosophical, identified it with
<span class="Greek"><span id="iv.viii.i.iv-p19.25"></span>οὐσία</span>,
and so the Nicene Confession anathematized those who maintained the Son
to be of a different substance or essence from the Father (<span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.viii.i.iv-p19.26"></span>ὑ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.viii.i.iv-p19.27"></span>ποστάσεως ἢ
οὐσίας</span>). In the version of Hilary of Poictiers (*de Synodis,*
§84; Op. ii. 510) <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.viii.i.iv-p19.28"></span>οὐσία</span> is translated by
“substantia,” the etymological equivalent of <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.viii.i.iv-p19.29"></span>ὑ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.viii.i.iv-p19.30"></span>πόστασις</span>, except in the phrase
quoted, when “substantia aut essentia” represents <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.viii.i.iv-p19.31"></span>οὐσία</span> by its
own etymological equivalent “essentia.” Thus in <span class="c14"><span
id="iv.viii.i.iv-p19.32"></span>a.d.</span> 325 to have contended for
<span class="Greek"><span id="iv.viii.i.iv-p19.33"></span>τρεῖς
ὑποστάσεις</span> would have been heretical. But as the subtilty of
controversy required greater nicety of phrase, it was laid down (Basil
the Great, Ep. 38<span id="iv.viii.i.iv-p19.34"></span>) that while
<span class="Greek"><span id="iv.viii.i.iv-p19.35"></span>οὐσία</span>
is an universal denoting that which is common to the individuals of a
species, <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.viii.i.iv-p19.36"></span>ὑ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.viii.i.iv-p19.37"></span>πόστασις</span> makes an individual that
which it is, and constitutes personal existence. Hence <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.viii.i.iv-p19.38"></span>μία ὑπόστασις</span>
became Sabellian, and <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.viii.i.iv-p19.39"></span>τρεῖς οὐσίαι</span> Arian, while <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.viii.i.iv-p19.40"></span>τρεῖς
ὑποστάσεις</span> was orthodox. cf Theod. Dial. i. 7. Eranistes loq. “Is
there any distinction between <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.viii.i.iv-p19.41"></span>οὐσία</span> and <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.viii.i.iv-p19.42"></span>ὑ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.viii.i.iv-p19.43"></span>πόστασις</span>?”

<span id="iv.viii.i.iv-p20"></span>Orthodoxus. “In extra-Christian
philosophy there is not; for <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.viii.i.iv-p20.1"></span>οὐσία</span> signifies <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.viii.i.iv-p20.2"></span>τὸ ὄν</span>, that
which is, and <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.viii.i.iv-p20.3"></span>ὑ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.viii.i.iv-p20.4"></span>πόστασις</span> that which subsists. But
according to the doctrine of the Fathers there is the same difference
between <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.viii.i.iv-p20.5"></span>οὐσία</span> and <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.viii.i.iv-p20.6"></span>ὑ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.viii.i.iv-p20.7"></span>πόστασις</span> as
between the common and the particular; the race, and the species or
individual.”…“The Divine <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.viii.i.iv-p20.8"></span>οὐσία</span> (substance) means the Holy
Trinity; but the <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.viii.i.iv-p20.9"></span>ὑ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.viii.i.iv-p20.10"></span>πόστασις</span> indicates any <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.viii.i.iv-p20.11"></span>πρόσωπον</span>
(person) as of the Father, the Son, or of the Holy Ghost. For we who
follow the definitions of the Fathers assert <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.viii.i.iv-p20.12"></span>ὑ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.viii.i.iv-p20.13"></span>πόστασις</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.viii.i.iv-p20.14"></span>,</span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.viii.i.iv-p20.15"></span>πρόσωπον</span> and <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.viii.i.iv-p20.16"></span>ἰ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.viii.i.iv-p20.17"></span>διότης</span>
(substantial nature, person, or individuality) to mean the same thing.”
