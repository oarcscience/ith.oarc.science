id="fr_2642"></span>[2643](#fn_2642.md) </span> bishop of the church at
Turin, a man fairly industrious in the study of the Holy Scripture, and
good at teaching the people extemporaneously, composed treatises *In
praise of the apostles and John the Baptist,* and a *Homily on all the
martyrs.* Moreover he wrote many acute comments on passages from the
Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles. He wrote also two treatises, *On
the life* <span id="fr_2643"></span>[2644](#fn_2643.md) *of Saint
Eusebius,* bishop of Vercelli, and confessor, and *On Saint Cyprian,*
and published a monograph *On the grace of baptism.* I have read his *On
avarice, On hospitality, On the eclipse of the moon, On almsgiving, On
the saying in Isaiah, Your winedealers mix wine with water, On Our
Lord’s Passion,* A general treatise *On fasting by the servants of God,
On the quadragesimal fast* in particular, and *That there should be no
jesting on fast day, On Judas,* the betrayer, *On Our Lord’s cross, On
His sepulchre, On His resurrection, On the accusation and trial of Our
Lord before Pontius Pilate, On the Kalends of January,* a homily *On the
day of Our Lord’s Nativity,* also homilies *On Epiphany, On the
Passover, On Pentecost,* many also, *On having no fear of carnal Foes,
On giving thanks after meat, On the repentance of the Ninivites,* and
other homilies of his, published <span
id="fr_2644"></span>[2645](#fn_2644.md) on various occasions, whose names I
do not remember. He died in the reign of Honorius and Theodosius the
younger.
