Augustine then presbyter, in many letters, that he should exercise his
genius and take time for exposition of the Scriptures that, as it were,
a new Ambrosius, the task master of Origen might appear. Wherefore also
he sent to him many examinations of scriptures. There is also an epistle
of his of *Questions* in which he teaches by asking questions as if
wishing to learn.
