<span id="vi.xii.iii.xxvii-p1"></span> 26. I think it a point which
should not be passed over, that you have no right to complain that the
falsifier of your papers holds in my esteem the glorious position of a
confessor, since you who are guilty of this very crime are called a
martyr and an apostle by all the partisans of Origen, for that exile and
imprisonment of yours at Alexandria. On your alleged inexperience in
Latin composition I have answered you above. But, since you repeat the
same things, and, as if forgetful of your former defence, again remind
me that I ought to know that you have been occupied for thirty years in
devouring Greek books, and therefore do not know Latin, I would have you
observe that it is not a few words of yours with which I find fault,
though indeed all your writing is worthy of being destroyed. What I
wished to do was to shew your followers, whom you have taken so much
pains in teaching to know nothing, to understand what amount of modesty
there is in a man who teaches what he does not know, who writes what he
is ignorant of, so that they may expect to find the same wisdom in his
opinions. As to what you add “That it is not faults of words which are
offensive, but sins, such as lying, calumny, disparagement, false
witness, and all evil speaking, and that the mouth which speaketh lies
kills the soul,” and your deprecation, “Let not that ill-savour reach my
nostrils;” I would believe what you say, were it not that I discover
facts inconsistent with this. It is as if a fuller or a tanner in
speaking to a dealer in pigments should warn him that he had better hold
his nose as he passed their shops. I will do what <span id="page_533">p.
533</span> <span id="vi.xii.iii.xxvii-Page_533"></span>you recommend; I
will stop my nose, so that it may not be put to the torture by the
delightful odour of your truth-speaking and your benedictions.

and blaming him in others. You have done it in my case.](2030830.md)
