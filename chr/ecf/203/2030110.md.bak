<span id="iv.viii.iv.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.iv.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV</span>.—*Of the restoration of
allowances to the churches; and of the Emperor’s death.*

<span id="iv.viii.iv.iv-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.iv.iv-p2.1"></span>When</span> the emperor had received this
letter, his former knowledge of and disposition to divine things was
confirmed, and he issued a second edict wherein he ordered the amount of
corn which the great Constantine had appropriated to the churches to be
restored. <span id="fr_673"></span>[674](#fn_673.md) For Julian, as was to
be expected of one who had gone to war with our Lord and Saviour, had
stopped even this mainten<span id="page_110">p. 110</span> <span
id="iv.viii.iv.iv-Page_110"></span>ance, and since the famine which
visited the empire in consequence of Julian’s iniquity prevented the
collection of the contribution of Constantine’s enactment, Jovian
ordered a third part to be supplied for the present, and promised that
on the cessation of the famine he would give the whole.

<span id="iv.viii.iv.iv-p4"></span>After distinguishing the beginning of
his reign by edicts of this kind, Jovian set out from Antioch for the
Bosphorus; but at Dadastanæ, a village lying on the confines of Bithynia
and Galatia, he died. <span id="fr_674"></span>[675](#fn_674.md) He set out
on his journey from this world with the grandest and fairest support and
stay, but all who had experienced the clemency of his sway were left
behind in pain. So, methinks, the Supreme Ruler, to convict us of our
iniquity, both shews us good things and again deprives us of them; so by
the former means He teaches us how easily He can give us what He will;
by the latter He convicts us of our unworthiness of it, and points us to
the better life.

<span id="iv.viii.iv.iv-p5"></span> At an obscure place called
Dadastanæ, half way between Ancyra and Nicæa, after a hearty supper he
went to bed in a room newly built. The plaster was still damp, and a
brazier of charcoal was brought in to warm the air. In the morning he
was found dead in his bed. (Amm. xxv. 10. 12. 13.) This was in February
or March, 364.
