<span id="vi.xii.iii.xxxv-p1"></span> 34. “But why,” you ask, “did you
<span id="page_536">p. 536</span> <span
id="vi.xii.iii.xxxv-Page_536"></span>accept my manuscripts which had
been falsified? and why, when I had translated the <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xii.iii.xxxv-p1.1"></span>Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν</span>
did you dare to put your pen to the same work? If I had erred, as any
man may, ought you not to summon me to reply by a private letter, and to
speak smoothly to me, as I am speaking smoothly in my present letter?”
My whole fault is this that, when accusations were brought against me in
the guise of disingenuous praise, I tried to purge myself from them, and
this without invidiously introducing your name. I wished to refer to
many persons a charge which you alone had brought, not so as to retort
the charge of heresy upon you, but to repel it from myself. Could I know
that you would be angry if I wrote against the heretics? You had said
that you had taken away the heretical passages from the works of Origen.
I therefore turned my attacks not upon you but upon the heretics, for I
did not believe that you were a favourer of heresy. Pardon me, if I did
this with too great vehemence. I thought that I should give you
pleasure. You say that it was by the dishonest tricks of those who acted
for me that your manuscripts were brought out before the public, when
they were kept secretly in your chamber, or were in possession only of
the man who had desired to have the translation made for him. But how is
this reconcilable with your former statement that either no one or very
few had them? If they were kept secret in your chamber, how could they
be in the possession of the man who had desired to have the translation
made for him? If the one man for whom the manuscripts had been written
had obtained them in order to conceal them, then they were not kept
secret in your chamber, and they were not in the hands of those few who,
as you now declare, possessed them. You accuse us of having stolen them
away; and then again you reproach us with having bought them for a great
sum of money and an immense bribe. In a single matter, and in one little
letter, what a tissue of various and discordant falsehoods! You have
full liberty for accusation, but I have none for defence. When you bring
a charge, you think nothing about friendship. When I begin to reply,
then your mind is full of the rights of friendship. Let me ask you: Did
you write these manuscripts for concealment or for publication? If for
concealment, why were they written? If for publication, why did you
conceal them?

[Next: As to our translations of the Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν, yours was doing harm,
and mine was necessary in self-defence. You should be glad that heresy
is exposed.](2030838.md)
