<span id="vi.xiii.xviii-p1"></span> 17. It is with no loss or
disparagement therefore of His Divine nature that Christ suffers in the
flesh, but His Divine nature through the flesh descended into death,
that by the infirmity of the flesh He might effect salvation; not that
He might be detained by death according to the law of mortality, but
that He might by Himself in his resurrection open the gates of death. It
is as if a king were to proceed to a prison, and to go in and open the
doors, undo the fetters, break in pieces the chains, the bars, and the
bolts, and bring forth and set at liberty the prisoners, and restore
those who are sitting in darkness and in the shadow of death to light
and life. The king, therefore, is said indeed to have been in prison,
but not under the same condition as the prisoners who were detained
there. They were in prison to be punished, He to free them from
punishment.
