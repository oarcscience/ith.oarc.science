<span id="iv.x.clxxv-p1"></span> *CLXXIV. To Himerius, Bishop of
Nicomedia.* <span id="fr_2304"></span>[2305](#fn_2304.md)

<span id="iv.x.clxxv-p3"></span>We wish to acquaint your holiness that
on reading and frequently discussing the letter brought from Egypt we
find it in harmony with the doctrine of the Church. Of the twelve
Chapters we have proved the contrary, and up to the present time we
continue to oppose them. We have therefore determined, if your holiness
has recovered the churches divinely entrusted to you, that you ought to
communicate with the Egyptians and Constantinopolitans and others who
have fought with them against us, because they have professed to hold
our faith, or I should rather say the faith of the apostles; but not to
give your consent to the alleged condemnation of the very holy and
venerable Nestorius. For we hold it impious and unjust in the case of
charges in which both appeared as defendants to lavish favour on the one
and shut the door of repentance on the other. Far more unjust and
impious is it to condemn an innocent man to death. Your holiness should
be assured that you ought not to communicate with them before you have
recovered your churches. For this not only I but all the holy bishops of
our district decreed in the recent Council.

<span id="iv.x.clxxv-p2"></span> Himerius was of the “Conciliabulum,”
and a staunch Nestorian. LeQuien points out that he, as well as
Theodoret, became ultimately reconciled to the victorious party.
