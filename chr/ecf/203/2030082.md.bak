<span id="iv.viii.ii.xxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.ii.xxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVIII</span>.—*About
Eusebius, Bishop of Samosata*.

<span id="iv.viii.ii.xxviii-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.ii.xxviii-p2.1"></span>The</span> admirable Eusebius
mentioned above, who was entrusted with the common resolution, when he
beheld the violation of the covenant, returned to his own see. Then
certain men who were uneasy about the written document, persuaded
Constantius to dispatch a messenger to recover it. Accordingly the
emperor sent one of the officers who ride post with relays of horses,
and bring communications with great speed. On his arrival he reported
the imperial message, but, “I cannot,” said the admirable Eusebius,
“surrender the deed deposited with me till I am directed so to do by the
whole assembly who gave it me.” This reply was reported to the emperor.
Boiling with rage he sent to Eusebius again and ordered him to give it
up, with the further message that he had ordered his right hand to be
cut off if he refused. But he only wrote this to terrify the bishop, for
the courier who conveyed the dispatch had orders not to carry out the
threat. But when the divine Eusebius opened the letter and saw the
punishment which the emperor had threatened, he stretched out his right
hand and his left, bidding the man cut off both. “The decree,” said he,
“which is a clear proof of Arian wickedness, I will not give up.”

<span id="iv.viii.ii.xxviii-p3"></span>When Constantius had been
informed of this courageous resolution he was struck with astonishment,
and did not cease to admire it; for even foes are constrained by the
greatness of bold deeds to admire their adversaries success.

<span id="iv.viii.ii.xxviii-p4"></span>At this time Constantius learned
that Julian, whom he had declared Cæsar of Europe, was aiming at
sovereignty, and mustering an army against his master. Therefore he set
out from Syria, and died in Cilicia. <span
id="fr_593"></span>[594](#fn_593.md) Nor had he the helper whom his <span
id="page_94">p. 94</span> <span
id="iv.viii.ii.xxviii-Page_94"></span>Father had left him; for he had
not kept intact the inheritance of his Father’s piety, and so bitterly
bewailed his change of faith.

<span id="iv.viii.ii.xxviii-p5"></span> Constantius died at Mopsucrene,
on the Cydnus, according to Socrates and the Chron. Alex., on *Nov. 3,*
361. Socrates (ii. 47) ascribes his illness to chagrin at the successes
of Julian, and says that he died in the 46th year of his age and 39th of
his reign, having for thirteen years been associated in the empire with
his Father. Ammianus (xxi. 15, 2) writes, “Venit Tarsum, ubi leviore
febri contactus, ratusque itinerario motu imminutae valetudinis excuti
posse discrimen, petiit per vias difficiles Mopsucrenas, Cillciae
ultimam hinc pergentibus stationem, sub Tauri montis radicibus positam:
egredique sequuto die conatus, invalenti morbi gravitate detentus est:
paulatimque urente calore nimio venas, ut ne tangi quidem corpus eius
posset in modum foculi fervens, cum usus deficeret medelarum, ultimum
spirans deflebat exitium; mentisque sensu tum etiam integro, successorem
suae potestatis statuisse dicitur Julianum. Deinde anhelitu iam pulsatus
letali conticuit diuque cum anima colluctatus iam discessura, abiit e
vita III. Non. Octobrium, (i.e. Oct. 5—a different date from that given
by others) imperii vitaeque anno quadragesimo et mensibus paucis.” His
Father having died in 337, Constantius really reigned 24 years alone,
and if we include the 13 years which Socrates reckons in the lifetime of
Constantine, we only reach 37. He was born on Aug. 6, 317, and was
therefore a little over 44 at his death.

<span id="iv.viii.ii.xxviii-p6"></span>“Constantius was essentially a
little man, in whom his father’s vices took a meaner form.” “The
peculiar repulsiveness of Constantius is not due to any flagrant
personal vice, but to the combination of cold-blooded treachery with the
utter want of any inner nobleness of character. Yet he was a pious
emperor, too, in his way. He loved the ecclesiastical game, and was
easily won over to the Eusebian side.”
