<span id="vi.xii.ii.vii-p1"></span> 6. Of the devil he thus frames his
opinion:

<span id="vi.xii.ii.vii-p2"></span>“We affirm also a judgment to come,
in which judgment every man is to receive the due meed of his bodily
life, according to that which he has done, whether good or evil. And, if
in the case of men the reward is according to their works how much more
will it be so in the case of the devil who is the universal cause of
sin. Of the devil himself our belief is that which is written in the
Gospel, namely that both he and all his angels will receive as their
portion the eternal fire, and with him those who do his works, that is,
who become the accusers of their brethren. If then any one denies that
the devil is to be subjected to eternal fires, may he have his part with
him in the eternal fire, so that he may know by experience the fact
which he now denies.”

<span id="vi.xii.ii.vii-p3"></span>I will repeat the words one by one.
“We affirm also a judgment to come, in which judgment &c.” I had
determined to say nothing about verbal faults. But, since his disciples
admire the eloquence of their master, I will make one or two strictures
upon it. He had already said “a future judgment;” but, being a cautious
man, he was afraid of saying simply “in which,” and therefore wrote “in
which judgment;” for fear that, if he had not said “judgment” a second
time, we, forgetting what had gone before, might have supplied the word
“ass.” That which he brings in afterwards “those who become the accusers
of their brethren will with him have their portion in the eternal fire,”
is in a style of equal beauty. Who ever heard of ‘possessing <span
id="fr_3087"></span>[3088](#fn_3087) the flames’? It would be like
‘enjoying tortures.’ I suppose that, being now a Greek, he had tried to
translate himself, and that for the word <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xii.ii.vii-p4.1"></span>κληρονομήσουσιν</span>, <span
id="fr_3088"></span>[3089](#fn_3088) which can be rendered in Latin by
the single word Hæreditabunt, he said Hæreditate potientur <span
id="fr_3089"></span>[3090](#fn_3089) supposing it to be something more
elaborate and ornate. With such trifles and such improprieties of speech
his whole discourse is teeming. But to return to the meaning of his
words.

[Next: His confession of faith is unsatisfactory. No one asked him about
the Trinity, but about Origen's doctrines of the Resurrection, the
origin of souls, and the salvability of Satan. As to the Resurrection
and to Satan he is ambiguous. As to souls he professes
ignorance.](2030780)
