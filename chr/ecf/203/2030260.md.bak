<span id="iv.x.lxxi-p1"></span> *LXXI. To Zeno,* <span
id="fr_1715"></span>[1716](#fn_1715.md) *General and Consul.*

<span id="iv.x.lxxi-p3"></span>Your fortitude rouses universal
admiration, tempered as it is by gentleness and meekness, and exhibited
to your household in kindliness, to your foes in boldness. These
qualities indicate an admirable general. In a soldier’s character the
main ornament is bravery, but in a commander prudence takes precedence
of bravery; after these come self-control and fairness, whereby a wealth
of virtue is gathered. Such wealth is the reward of the soul which
reaches after good, and with its eyes fixed on the sweetness of the
fruit, deems the toil right pleasant. For to virtue’s athletes the God
of all, like some great giver of games, has offered prizes, some in this
life, and some in that life beyond which has no end. Those in this
present life your excellency has already enjoyed, and you have achieved
the highest honour. Be it also the lot of your greatness to obtain too
those abiding and perpetual blessings, and to re<span id="page_271">p.

consul’s robe, but also the garment that is indescribable and divine. Of
all them that understand the greatness of that gift this is the common
petition.
