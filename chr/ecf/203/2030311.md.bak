<span id="iv.x.cxxii-p1"></span> *CXXI. To Anatolius the
Patrician.* <span id="fr_1907"></span>[1908](#fn_1907.md)

<span id="iv.x.cxxii-p3"></span>The Lord who overlooks and governs all
things has shewn both the apostolic truth of my doctrines, and the
falsehood of the slander laid at my door. For the writings sent from the
right godly and holy lord Leo, archbishop of Great Rome, to Flavianus of
holy memory and to the rest assembled at Ephesus, are entirely in
harmony with what I myself have written and have always preached in
church. So soon therefore as I had read them, I praised the
loving-kindness of the Lord, in that He had not wholly forsaken the
churches, but had protected the spark of orthodoxy; or—shall I not
rather say?—not a spark, but a very great torch, such as might enkindle
and enlighten the world; for he has truly, in his writings, observed the
apostolic stamp, and in them we have found at once what has <span
id="page_298">p. 298</span> <span id="iv.x.cxxii-Page_298"></span>been
delivered by the holy and blessed prophets and apostles, and their
successors in the preaching of the Gospel, and moreover the holy Fathers
assembled at Nicæa. By these I confess that I abide, and indict all who
hold other doctrines as guilty of impiety. Side by side with these
writings of mine I have set one of the letters sent by him to Ephesus,
to the end that when your excellency reads them you may remember the
words which I have often spoken in church, may recognise the harmony of
the doctrines, and may hate the utterers of the lie as well as those who
have set up their new heresy in opposition to the doctrines of the
Apostle.

<span id="iv.x.cxxii-p2"></span> This letter may be dated shortly after
Letter CXIX. Garnerius points out that it contains a short summary of
the orthodox tradition, but makes no mention of the council of Ephesus
in 431.
