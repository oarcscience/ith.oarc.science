<span id="v.iv.lxxii-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="v.iv.lxxii-p2.1"></span>Leo, <span
id="fr_2692"></span>[2693](#fn_2692.md) </span> bishop <span
id="fr_2693"></span>[2694](#fn_2693.md) of Rome, wrote a letter to
*Flavianus,* bishop of the church at Constantinople, against Eutyches
the presbyter, who at that time, on account of his ambition for the
episcopate was trying to introduce novelties into the church. In this he
advises Flavianus, if Eutyches confesses his error and promises
amendment, to receive him, but if he should persist in the course he had
entered on, that he should be condemned together with his heresy. He
likewise teaches in this epistle and confirms by divine testimony that
as the Lord Jesus Christ is to be considered the true son of the Divine
Father, so likewise he is to be considered true man with human nature,
that is, that he derived a body of flesh from the flesh of the virgin
and not as Eutyches asserted, that he showed a body from heaven. <span
id="fr_2694"></span>[2695](#fn_2694.md) He died in the reign of Leo and
Majorianus.
