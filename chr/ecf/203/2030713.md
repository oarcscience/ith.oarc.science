<span id="vi.xi.iii.xxix-p1"></span> 25. You observe how he treats
Ambrose. <span id="page_471">p. 471</span> <span
id="vi.xi.iii.xxix-Page_471"></span>First, he calls him a crow and says
that he is black all over; then he calls him a jackdaw who decks himself
in other birds’ showy feathers; and then he rends him with his foul
abuse, and declares that there is nothing manly in a man whom God has
singled out to be the glory of the churches of Christ, who has <span
id="fr_2975"></span>[2976](#fn_2975) spoken of the testimonies of the
Lord even in the sight of persecuting kings and has not been alarmed.
The saintly Ambrose wrote his book on the Holy Spirit not in words only
but with his own blood; for he offered his life-blood to his
persecutors, and shed it within himself, although God preserved his life
for future labours. Suppose that he did follow some of the Greek writers
belonging to our Catholic body, and borrowed something from their
writings, it should hardly have been the first thought in your mind,
(still less the object of such zealous efforts as to make you set to
work to translate the work of Didymus on the Holy Spirit,) to blaze
abroad what you call his plagiarisms, which were very possibly the
result of a literary necessity when he had to reply at once to some
ravings of the heretics. Is this the fairness of a Christian? Is it thus
that we are to observe the injunction of the Apostle, <span
id="fr_2976"></span>[2977](#fn_2976) “Do nothing through faction or
through vain glory”? But I might turn the tables on you and ask, <span
id="fr_2977"></span>[2978](#fn_2977) Thou that sayest that a man should
not steal, dost thou steal? I might quote a fact I have already
mentioned, namely, that, a little before you wrote your commentary on
Micah, you had been accused of plagiarizing from Origen. And you did not
deny it, but said: “What they bring against me in violent abuse I accept
as the highest praise; for I wish to imitate the man whom we and all who
are wise admire.” Your plagiarisms redound to your highest praise; those
of others make them crows and jackdaws in your estimation. If you act
rightly in imitating Origen whom you call second only to the Apostles,
why do you sharply attack another for following Didymus, whom
nevertheless you point to by name as a Prophet and an apostolic man? For
myself I must not complain, since you abuse us all alike. First you do
not spare Ambrose, great and highly esteemed as he was; then the man of
whom you write that he was second only to the Apostles, and that all the
wise admire him, and whom you have praised up to the skies a thousand
times over, not as you say in two, but in innumerable places, this man
who was before an Apostle, you now turn round and make a heretic.
Thirdly, this very Didymus whom you designate the Seer-Prophet, who has
the eye of the bride in the Song of Songs, and whom you call according
to the meaning of his name <span id="fr_2978"></span>[2979](#fn_2978) an
Apostolic man, you now on the other hand criminate as a perverse
teacher, and separate him off with what you call your censor’s rod, into
the communion of heretics. I do not know whence you received this rod. I
know that Christ once gave the keys to Peter: but what spirit it is who
now dispenses these censors’ rods, it is for you to say. However, if you
condemn all those I have mentioned with the same mouth with which you
once praised them, I who in comparison of them am but like a flea, must
not complain, I repeat, if now you tear me to pieces, though once you
praised me, and in your Chronicle <span
id="fr_2979"></span>[2980](#fn_2979) equalled me to Florentius and
Bonosus for the nobleness, as you said, of my life.
