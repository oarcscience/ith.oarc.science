was given Him to drink, or wine mingled with myrrh which is bitterer
than gall. Hear what the Prophet has foretold of this: “They gave Me
gall to eat, and when I was thirsty they gave Me vinegar to
drink.” <span id="fr_3339"></span>[3340](#fn_3339) Agreeably with which
Moses, even in his day, said to the people, “Their vine is of the
vineyards of Sodom, and their branch of Gomorrah; their grape is a grape
of gall, and their cluster a cluster of bitterness.” <span
id="fr_3340"></span>[3341](#fn_3340) And again, the Prophet upbraiding
them says, “Oh foolish people and unwise, have ye thus requited the
Lord?” <span id="fr_3341"></span>[3342](#fn_3341) Moreover, in the
Canticles the same things are foretold, where even the garden in which
the Lord was crucified is indicated: “I have come into my garden, my
sister, my spouse, and have gathered in my myrrh.” <span
id="fr_3342"></span>[3343](#fn_3342) Here the Prophet has plainly set
forth the wine mingled with myrrh which the Lord has given Him to drink.
