<span id="iv.x.lxvi-p3"></span>She that gave you birth and nurtured you
invites you to the longed-for feast. The holy shrine is crowned by a
roof; it is fitly adorned; it is eager for the inhabitants for whom it
was erected. These are Apostles and Prophets, loud-voiced heralds of the
old and new covenant. Adorn, therefore, the feast with your presence;
receive the blessing which swells forth from it, and make the feast more
joyous to us.

invitation to a church which Aerius had built at Cyrus, his native city,
was probably written early in the episcopate of Theodoret.
