<span id="iv.x.clxxix-p1"></span> *CLXXVIII. Letter to Alexander of
Hierapolis.* <span id="fr_2308"></span>[2309](#fn_2308)

<span id="iv.x.clxxix-p3"></span>I think that more than all the very
holy and venerable bishop, my lord John, must have been gratified at my
refusing either to give my consent to the condemnation of the very holy
and venerable bishop Nestorius or to violate the pledges made at Tarsus,
Chalcedon and Ephesus. <span id="fr_2309"></span>[2310](#fn_2309)

<span id="iv.x.clxxix-p5"></span>He remembers also what was frequently
received from us at Antioch after our departure.

<span id="iv.x.clxxix-p6"></span>Let no one therefore deceive your
holiness into the belief that I should ever do this, for God is without
doubt on my side and strengthening me.

<span id="iv.x.clxxix-p2"></span> The complete letter is given in
another Latin version Baluz. Synod. LXVI. Garnerius makes it the
conclusion of the letter to Andrew of Samosata.

<span id="iv.x.clxxix-p4"></span> The order of events is reversed. John
and his friends went from Ephesus to Chalcedon, from Chalcedon via
Ancyra to Tarsus, where he was in his own patriarchate, and held a
council, confirming Cyril’s deposition, and pledging its members never
to abandon Nestorius. Again at Antioch the same course was repeated.
