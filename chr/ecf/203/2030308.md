<span id="iv.x.cxix-p1"></span> *CXVIII. To the Archdeacon of
Rome.* <span id="fr_1901"></span>[1902](#fn_1901.md)

<span id="iv.x.cxix-p3"></span>A terrible storm has attacked our
churches, but the adherents of the apostolic faith have in your holiness
a safe and quiet haven. Not only do you champion the cause of the
doctrines of the Gospel, but you utterly detest the wrong done to me. I
was living far away at a distance of thirty-five days’ journey, when I
was condemned at their good pleasure by those most righteous judges.
Teaching which has obtained in the churches from the coming of God our
Saviour till this day they have abandoned. They have introduced a novel
and bastard doctrine, diametrically contrary to the tradition of the
apostles, and are openly at war with them that hold to the ancient
instruction. Deign, then, most godly sir, to kindle the zeal of the very
sacred and holy archbishop, that the churches of the East too may enjoy
your kindly care. Above all fight in behalf of the faith delivered from
the beginning by the holy apostles; preserve the heritage of our fathers
unimpaired, and scatter the mist that oppresses us. Give us instead of
moonless night clear sunshine, and condemn the wickedness of the
massacre unrighteously wrought against us. It is becoming to your
holiness to add yet this act of zeal to your other good deeds.

is doubtful whether the archdeacon is Hilarius or another. The evidence
seems in favour of the identity.
