<span id="vi.xii.iii.xxv-p1"></span> 24. It is somewhat the same
argument which you use against the pope Anastasius, namely, that, since
you hold the letters of the bishop Siricius, it was impossible that he
should write against you. I am afraid you suspect that some injury has
been done you. I cannot understand how a man of your acuteness and
capacity can condescend to such nonsense; you suppose that your readers
are foolish, but you shew that you are foolish yourself. Then after this
extraordinary argumentation, you subjoin this little sentence: “Far be
such conduct from these reverend persons. It is from your school that
such actions proceed. You gave us all the signs of peace at our
departure, and then threw missiles charged with venom from behind our
backs.” In this clause or rather declamatory speech, you intended, no
doubt, to shew your rhetorical skill. It is true we gave you the signs
of peace, but not to em<span id="page_532">p. 532</span> <span

accompanied you as you set forth on your journey, on the understanding
that you were catholic not that we were heretical. But I want to learn
what these poisoned missiles are which you complain that I threw from
behind your back. I sent the presbyters, Vincentius, Paulinianus,
Eusebius, Rufinus. Of these, Vincentius went to Rome long before you;
Paulinianus and Eusebius set out a year after you had sailed; Rufinus
two years after, for the cause of Claudius; all of them either for
private reasons, or because another was in peril of his life. Was it
possible for me to know that when you entered Rome, a nobleman had
dreamed that a ship full of merchandise was entering with full blown
sails? or that all questions about fate were being solved by a solution
which should not itself be fatuous? or that you were translating the
book of Eusebius as if it were Pamphilus’? or that you were putting your
own cover upon Origen’s poisoned dish by lending your majestic eloquence
to this translation of his notorious work <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xii.iii.xxv-p1.1"></span>Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν</span>? This is a new way of
calumniating a man. We sent out the accusers before you had committed
the crime. It was not, I repeat, it was not by our plan, but by the
providence of God, that these men, who were sent out for another reason,
came to fight against the rising heresy. They were sent, like Joseph, to
relieve the coming famine by the fervour of their faith.
