<span id="iv.viii.ii.xix-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.ii.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIX</span>.—*Concerning the
cunning of Leontius, Bishop of Antioch, and the boldness of Flavianus
and Diodorus*.

<span id="iv.viii.ii.xix-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.ii.xix-p2.1"></span>At</span> Antioch Placidus was succeeded
by Stephanus, who was expelled from the Church. Leontius then accepted
the Primacy, but in violation of the decrees of the Nicene Council, for
he had mutilated himself, and was an eunuch. The cause of his rash deed
is thus narrated by the blessed Athanasius. Leontius, it seems, was the
victim of slanderous statements on account of a certain young woman of
the name of Eustolia. <span id="fr_566"></span>[567](#fn_566.md) Finding
himself prevented from dwelling with her he mutilated himself for her
sake, in order that he might feel free to live with her. But he did not
clear himself of suspicion, and all the more for this reason was deposed
from the presbyterate. So much Athanasius has written about the rest of
his earlier life. I shall now give a summary exposure of his evil
conduct. Now though he shared the Arian error, he always endeavoured to
conceal his unsoundness. He observed that the clergy and the rest of the
people were divided into two parts, the one, in giving glory to the Son,
using the conjunction “and,” the other using the preposition “through”
of the Son, and applying “in” to the Holy Ghost. He himself offered all
the doxology in silence, and all that those <span id="page_85">p.
85</span> <span id="iv.viii.ii.xix-Page_85"></span>standing near him
could hear was the “For ever and ever.” And had not the exceeding
wickedness of his soul been betrayed by other means, it might have been
said that he adopted this contrivance from a wish to promote concord
among the people. But when he had wrought much mischief to the champions
of the truth, and continued to give every support to the promoters of
impiety, he was convicted of concealing his own unsoundness. He was
influenced both by his fear of the people, and by the grievous threats
which Constantius had uttered against any who had dared to say that the
Son was unlike the Father. His real sentiments were however proved by
his conduct. Followers of the Apostolic doctrines never received from
him either ordination or indeed the least encouragement. Men, on the
other hand, who sided with the Arian superstition, were both allowed
perfect liberty in expressing their opinions, and were from time to time
admitted to priestly office. At this juncture Aetius, the master of
Eunomius, who promoted the Arian error by his speculations, was admitted
to the diaconate. Flavianus and Diodorus, however, who had embraced an
ascetic career, and were open champions of the Apostolic decrees,
publicly protested against the attacks of Leontius against true
religion. That a man nurtured in iniquity and scheming to win notoriety
by ungodliness should be counted worthy of the diaconate, was, they
urged, a disgrace to the Church. They further threatened that they would
withdraw from his communion, travel to the western empire, and publish
his plots to the world. Leontius was now alarmed, and suspended Aetius
from his sacred office, but continued to show him marked favour.

<span id="iv.viii.ii.xix-p5"></span>That excellent pair Flavianus and
Diodorus, <span id="fr_567"></span>[568](#fn_567.md) though not yet
admitted to the priesthood and still ranked with the laity, worked night
and day to stimulate men’s zeal for truth. They were the first to divide
choirs into two parts, and to teach them to sing the psalms of David
antiphonally. Introduced first at Antioch, the practice spread in all
directions, and penetrated to the ends of the earth. Its originators now
collected the lovers of the Divine word and work into the Churches of
the Martyrs, and with them spent the night in singing psalms to God.

<span id="iv.viii.ii.xix-p12"></span>When Leontius perceived this, he
did not think it safe to try to prevent them, for he saw that the people
were exceedingly well-disposed towards these excellent men. However,
putting a colour of courtesy on his speech, he requested that they would
perform this act of worship in the churches. They were perfectly well
aware of his evil intent. Nevertheless they set about obeying his behest
and readily summoned their choir <span id="fr_568"></span>[569](#fn_568.md)
to the Church, exhorting them to sing praises to the good Lord. Nothing,
however, could induce Leontius to correct his wickedness, but he put on
the mask of equity, <span id="fr_569"></span>[570](#fn_569.md) and
concealed the iniquity of Stephanus and Placidus. Men who had accepted
the corruption of the faith of priests and deacons, although they had
embraced a life of vile irregularity, he added to the roll; while others
adorned with every kind of virtue and firm adherents of apostolic
doctrines, he left unrecognised. Thus it came to pass that among the
clergy were numbered a majority of men tainted with heresy, while the
mass of the laity were champions of the Faith, and even professional
teachers lacked courage to lay bare their blasphemy. In truth the deeds
of impiety and iniquity done by Placidus, Stephanus, and Leontius, in
Antioch are so many as to want a special history of their own, and so
terrible <span id="page_86">p. 86</span> <span
id="iv.viii.ii.xix-Page_86"></span>as to be worthy of the lament of
David; for of them too it must be said “For lo thy enemies make a
murmuring and they that hate thee lift up their head. They have imagined
craftily against the people and taken counsel against thy secret ones.
They have said come and let us root them out that they be no more a
people: and that the name of Israel may be no more in
remembrance.” <span id="fr_570"></span>[571](#fn_570.md)

<span id="iv.viii.ii.xix-p16"></span>Let us now continue the course of
our narrative.

<span id="iv.viii.ii.xix-p6"></span> Flavianus was a noble native of
Antioch, and was afterwards (381–404) bishop of that see. Diodorus in
later times (c. 379) became bishop of Tarsus, “one of the most
deservedly venerated names in the Eastern church for learning, sanctity,
courage in withstanding heresy, and zeal in the defence of the truth.
Diodorus has a still greater claim on the grateful remembrances of the
whole church, as, if not the founder, the chief promoter of the rational
school of scriptural interpretation, of which his disciples, Chrysostom
and Theodorus of Mopsuestia, and Theodoret, were such distinguished
representatives.” *Dict. Christ. Biog*. i. 836. On the renewed
championship of the Antiochene church by Flavianus and Diodorus under
the persecution of Valens vide iv. 22.

<span id="iv.viii.ii.xix-p7"></span>Socrates (vi. 8), describing the
rivalry of the Homoousians and Arians in singing partizan hymns
antiphonally in the streets of Antioch in the days of Arcadius, traces
the mode of chanting to the great Ignatius, who once in a Vision heard
angels so praising God.

<span id="iv.viii.ii.xix-p8"></span>But, remarks Bp. Lightfoot
(Apostolic Fathers Pt. 2. I. p. 31.) “Antiphonal singing did not need to
be suggested by a heavenly Vision. It existed already among the heathen
in the arrangements of the Greek Chorus. It was practised with much
elaboration of detail in the Psalmody of the Jews, as appears from the
account which is given of the Egyptian Therapeutes. Its introduction
into the Christian Church therefore was a matter of course almost from
the beginning: and when we read in Pliny (Ep. x. 97<span
id="iv.viii.ii.xix-p8.1"></span>) that the Christians of Bithynia sang
hymns to Christ as to a god, ‘alternately’ (secum invicem) we may
reasonably infer that the practice of antiphonal singing prevailed far
beyond the limits of the church of Antioch, even in the time of Ignatius
himself.”

<span id="iv.viii.ii.xix-p9"></span>Augustine (Conf. ix. 7) states that
the fashion of singing “secundum morem orientalium partium” was
introduced into the Church of Milan at the time of the persecution of
Ambrose by Justina, “ne populus mœroris tœdio contabesceret,” and thence
spread all over the globe.

<span id="iv.viii.ii.xix-p10"></span>Platina attributes the introduction
of antiphons at Rome to Pope Damasus.

<span id="iv.viii.ii.xix-p11"></span>Hooker (ii. 166) quotes the older
authority of “the Prophet Esay,” in the vision where the seraphim cried
to one another in what Bp. Mant calls “the alternate hymn.”

evidence of the high development of ethics among the Greeks. It
expresses exactly that moderation which recognizes the impossibility,
cleaving to formal law, of anticipating or providing for all cases that
will emerge, and present themselves to it for decision…It is thus more
truly just than strict justice will have been; being <span
