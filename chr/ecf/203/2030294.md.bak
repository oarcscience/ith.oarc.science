<span id="iv.x.cv-p1"></span> *CV. To Eulogius the Œconomus.* <span
id="fr_1840"></span>[1841](#fn_1840.md)

<span id="iv.x.cv-p6"></span>We have heard from many sources of your
piety’s efforts on behalf of true religion. It is therefore right that
you should readily succour one who is calumniated for the same cause,
and should refute the reviler’s lies. You, O godly Sir, know what I
hold, and what I teach, and that no one has ever heard of my preaching
two sons. Exert, I implore you, in this case too your divine energy, and
stop the mouths of the evil speakers. In conflicts of this kind one must
help not only one’s friends but even those who have caused us pain.

<span id="iv.x.cv-p2"></span> In an ecclesiastical sense the title
œconomus was used of

<span id="iv.x.cv-p3"></span>(i) the treasurer of a particular church:
e.g. Cyriacus of Constantinople (Chron. Pasch. p. 378).

<span id="iv.x.cv-p4"></span>(ii) a diocesan official. The Council of
Chalcedon ordered that every diocese should have its œconomus.

<span id="iv.x.cv-p5"></span>(iii) the *custos monasterii,* who had
charge of the secular affairs of the monastery, as the diocesan œconomus
of those of the diocese.
