<span id="iv.x.clxv-p1"></span> *CLXIV. Second Epistle of the same to
the same, expressing premature triumph in Victory.* <span
id="fr_2273"></span>[2274](#fn_2273.md)

<span id="iv.x.clxv-p3"></span>Through the prayers of your holiness our
most pious prince has granted us an audience, and by God’s grace we have
got the better of our opponents, as all our views have been accepted by
the most Christ-loving emperor. The reports of others were read, and
what seemed unfit to be received, and had no further importance, he
rejected. They were full of Cyril, and petitioned that he might be
summoned to give an account of himself. So far they have not prevailed,
but have heard discourses on true religion, that is on the system of the
Faith, and that the faith of the blessed Fathers was confirmed. We
further refuted Acacius <span id="fr_2274"></span>[2275](#fn_2274.md) who
had laid down in his Commentaries that the Godhead is passible. At this
our pious emperor was so shocked at the enormity of the blasphemy that
he flung off his mantle, and stepped <span id="page_337">p. 337</span>
<span id="iv.x.clxv-Page_337"></span>back. We know that the whole
assembly welcomed us as champions of true religion.

<span id="iv.x.clxv-p5"></span>It has seemed good to our most pious
emperor that anyone should explain his own views, and report them to his
piety. We have replied that it is impossible for us to make any other
exposition than that made by the blessed Fathers at Nicæa, and so it has
pleased his majesty. We therefore offered the form subscribed by your
holiness. Moreover, the whole population of Constantinople is
continually coming out to us to implore us to fight manfully for the
Faith. We do our best to restrain them, to avoid giving offence to our
opponents. We have sent a copy of the expositing, that two copies may be
made, and you may subscribe them both.
