<span id="iv.x.vi-p2"></span>Our loving Lord has allowed us, with the
zeal of folks who love the Christ, to celebrate the divine feast of
salvation and enjoy the fruit of the spiritual blessing that flows from
it. Since we know the disposition of your Piety toward us, we write to
tell you this. <span id="page_252">p. 252</span> <span
