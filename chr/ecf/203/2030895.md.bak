<span id="vi.xiii.xlvii-p1"></span> 46. That the righteous shall ever
abide with Christ our Lord we have proved above, where we have shewn
that the Apostle says, “Then we which are alive and remain shall be
caught up together with them in the clouds to meet Christ in the air,
and so shall we ever be with the Lord.” <span
id="fr_3427"></span>[3428](#fn_3427.md) And do not marvel that the flesh of
the saints is to be changed into such a glorious condition at the
resurrection as to be caught up to meet God, suspended in the clouds and
borne in the air, since the same Apostle, setting forth the great things
which God bestows on them that love Him, says, “Who shall change our
vile body that it may be made like unto His glorious body.” <span
id="fr_3428"></span>[3429](#fn_3428.md) It is nowise absurd then, if the
bodies of the saints are said to be raised up into the air, seeing that
they are said to be renewed after the image of Christ’s body, which is
seated at God’s right hand. But this also the holy Apostle adds,
speaking either of himself or of others of his own place or merit, “He
will raise us up together with Christ and make us sit together in the
heavenly places.” <span id="fr_3429"></span>[3430](#fn_3429.md) Whence,
since God’s saints have these promises and an infinite number like them
respecting the resurrection of the righteous, it will now not be
difficult to believe those also which the Prophets have foretold,
namely, that “the righteous shall shine as the sun and as the brightness
of the firmament in the kingdom of God.” <span
id="fr_3430"></span>[3431](#fn_3430.md) For who will think it difficult
that they should have the brightness of the sun, and be adorned with the
splendour of the stars and of this firmament, for whom the life and
conversation of God’s angels are being prepared in heaven, or who are
represented as being hereafter to be conformed to the glory of Christ’s
body? In reference to which glory, promised by the Saviour’s mouth, the
holy Apostle says, “It is sown as an animal body; it will rise a
spiritual body.” <span id="fr_3431"></span>[3432](#fn_3431.md) For if it is
true, as it certainly is true, that God will vouchsafe to associate
every one of the righteous and of the saints in companionship with the
angels, it is certain that He will change their bodies also into the
glory of a spiritual body.
