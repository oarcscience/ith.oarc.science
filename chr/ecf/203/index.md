coming to Rome are absurd. His parents are dead and the journey is easy.
No one ever heard before of his being imprisoned or exiled for the
faith.](2030776)  
[His confession of faith is unsatisfactory. No one asked him about the
Trinity, but about Origen's doctrines of the Resurrection, the origin of
souls, and the salvability of Satan. As to the Resurrection and to Satan
he is ambiguous. As to souls he professes ignorance.](2030777)

the churches know.](2030783)

restitution. Where has he contradicted this?](2030785)

motive you translated the Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν.](2030787)

works.](2030788)

his own reason, defend the Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν as it stands.](2030789)

past literature.](2030790)  
[The object of Origen's letter, of which he translates only a part, is
not to shew the falsification of his writings but to vituperate the
Bishops who condemned him.](2030791)  
[It is only in reference to a particular point in his dispute with
Candidus that Origen alleges this falsification. The story of Hilary's
being condemned through his writings having been falsified has no
foundation.](2030792)  
[That which you tell about myself in Damasus' council is mere
after-dinner gossip.](2030793)  
[The attack on Epiphanius as a plagiarist of Origen is an outrage on the
Bishops generally. Origen never wrote 6000 books.](2030794)

Bishops generally. Origen never wrote 6000 books.](2030795)  
[I ascertained at the library at Cæsarea that the Apology you quote as
Pamphilus' is the work of Eusebius.](2030796)  
[The letter falsely circulated in Africa as mine, and expressing regret
for my translation of the Old Test. from the Hebrew bears the mark of
your hand. I have always honoured the Seventy Translators.](2030797)

Books from Genesis to Isaiah.](2030798)

compel me to answer?](2030805)

bribing your Secretary is an imputation to me of practices which are
your own.](2030806)

bribing your Secretary is an imputation to me of practices which are
your own.](2030807)  
[Eusebius should not have accused you; but your charges against him will
not stand.](2030808)

illiteracy?](2030809)

and make it impossible for me to keep silence.](2030810)  
[You wish first to praise, then to amend me, but both with fisticuffs;
and make it impossible for me to keep silence.](2030811)  
[Why cannot you join with me in condemning Origen, and so put an end to
our quarrel?](2030812)  
[The assertion that you had only two days for your answer is a
fiction.](2030813)  
[Your translation, contrariwise to my Commentaries, vouches for the
soundness of Origen.](2030814)  
[You try to shield Origen by falsely attributing the Apology for him to
Pamphilus.](2030815)  
[In my Commentaries my quotation of opposite opinions shows that neither
is mine.](2030816)  
[Had you translated honestly, you would not have had Origen's heresies
imputed to you.](2030817)  
[You say the Bishops of Italy accept your views on the Resurrection. I
doubt it.](2030818)  
[You rashly say that you will agree to whatever Theophilus lays down.
You have to consider your friendship for Isidore now his
enemy.](2030819)  
[You speak of the Egyptian Bishop Paul. We received him, though an
Origenist, as a stranger; and he has united himself to the orthodox
faith. Not only Theophilus but the Emperors condemn Origen.](2030820)

Origenist, as a stranger; and he has united himself to the orthodox
faith. Not only Theophilus but the Emperors condemn Origen.](2030821)  
[Against Vigilantius I wrote only what was right. I knew who had stirred
him up against me.](2030822)  
[As to the letter of Pope Anastasius condemning you, you will find that
it is genuine.](2030823)  
[Siricius who is dead may have written in your favour; Anastasius who is
living writes to the East against you.](2030824)  
[My departure from Rome for the East had nothing blameable in it as you
insinuate.](2030825)  
[Epiphanius, it is true, gave you the kiss of peace; but he showed
afterwards that he had come to distrust you.](2030826)  
[When we parted as friends I believed you a true believer; no one was
sent to Rome to injure you.](2030827)  
[You swear that you did not write my pretended retractation. Your style
betrays you, and I have given a full answer about my translations
already.](2030828)  
[You bid me beware of falsification and treachery. You warn me against
yourself.](2030829)  
[There is nothing inconsistent in praising a man for some things and
blaming him in others. You have done it in my case.](2030830)  
[My ignorance of many natural phenomena is no excuse for your ignorance
as to the origin of souls. You ought, according to your boasting dream
to know everything. The thing of most importance was forgotten in your
cargo of Eastern wares.](2030831)

me.](2030835)

and Aterbius before him.](2030836)
