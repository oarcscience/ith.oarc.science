<span id="iv.viii.iv.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.iv.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II</span>.—*Of the return of
Athanasius*.

<span id="iv.viii.iv.ii-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.iv.ii-p2.1"></span>Delighted</span> with these words the
emperor undertook for the future to take counsel for the safety of the
state, and how to bring home the army without loss from the campaign. He
was in no need of much deliberation, but at once reaped the fruit sprung
from the seeds of true religion, for the God of all gave proof of His
own providence, and caused all difficulty to disappear. No sooner had
the Persian sovereign been made acquainted with Jovian’s accession than
he sent envoys to treat for peace; nay more, he despatched provisions
for the troops and gave directions for the establishment of a market for
them in the desert. A truce was concluded for thirty years, and the army
brought home in safety from the war. <span
id="fr_666"></span>[667](#fn_666.md) The first edict of the emperor on
setting foot upon his own territory was one recalling the bishops from
their exile, and announcing the restoration of the churches to the
congregations who had held inviolate the confession of Nicæa. He further
sent a despatch to Athanasius, the famous champion of these doctrines,
beseeching that a letter might be written to him containing exact
teaching on matters of religion. Athanasius summoned the most learned
bishops to meet him, and wrote back exhorting the emperor to hold fast
the faith delivered at Nicæa, as being in harmony with apostolic
teaching. Anxious to benefit all who may meet with it I here subjoin the
letter. <span id="fr_667"></span>[668](#fn_667.md)

<span id="iv.viii.iv.ii-p3"></span> The terms were in fact humiliating,
“pacem cum Sapore necessariam quidem sed ignobilem fecit; multatus
finibus, ac nonnulla imperii Romani parte tradita: quod ante eum annis
mille centum et duobus de viginti fere ex quo Romanum imperium conditum
erat, nunquam accidit.” Eut. brev x. 17.

<span id="iv.viii.iv.ii-p4"></span> “Gibbon (Chap. xxv) sneers at
Athanasius for assuring Jovian ‘that his orthodox faith would be
rewarded with a long and peaceful reign,’ and remarks that after his
death this charge was omitted from some <span class="c14"><span
id="iv.viii.iv.ii-p4.1"></span>mss.</span>, referring to Valesius on the
passage of Theodoret, and Jortin’s *Remarks,* iv. p. 38. But the
expression is not that of a prophet who stakes his credit on the truth
of his prediction, but little more than a pious reflection, of the
nature of a wish.” Bp. J. Wordsworth, Dict. Christ. Biog. iii. 463. n.
Jortin says “the good bishop’s <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.viii.iv.ii-p4.2"></span>μαντική</span> failed him sadly; and the
emperor reigned only one year, and died in the flower of his age.” The
note of Valesius will be found below.
