<span id="vi.xi.iii.xxiv-p1"></span> 20. Well then; he says, “Give me an
instance in which I have so praised him as to defend his system of
belief.” You have no right to ask this, I reply; yet I will follow where
you lead. There is a certain writing of his <span
id="fr_2967"></span>[2968](#fn_2967.md) in which he gives a short catalogue
of the works which Varro wrote for the Latins, and of those which Origen
wrote in Greek for the Christians. In this he says:

<span id="vi.xi.iii.xxiv-p3"></span>Antiquity marvels at Marcus
Terentius Varro because of the countless books which he wrote for Latin
readers; and Greek writers are extravagant in their praise of their man
of brass, because he has written more works than one of us could so much
as copy. But since Latin ears would find a list of Greek writers
tiresome, I shall confine myself to the Latin Varro. I shall try to shew
that we of to-day are sleeping the sleep of Epimenides and devoting to
the amassing of riches the energy which our predecessors gave to sound
if secular learning.

<span id="vi.xi.iii.xxiv-p4"></span>Varro’s writings include forty-five
books of antiquities, four concerning the life of the Roman people.

<span id="vi.xi.iii.xxiv-p5"></span>But why, you ask me, have I thus
mentioned Varro and the man of brass? Simply to bring to your notice our
Christian man of brass, or, rather, man of adamant—Origen, I mean—whose
zeal for the study of Scripture has fairly earned for him this latter
name. Would you learn what monuments of his genius he has left us? The
following list exhibits them. His writings comprise thirteen books on
Genesis, two books of Mystical Homilies, notes on Exodus, notes on
Leviticus…also <span id="page_469">p. 469</span> <span
id="vi.xi.iii.xxiv-Page_469"></span>single books, four books on First
Principles, two books on the Resurrection, two dialogues on the same
subject.

<span id="vi.xi.iii.xxiv-p6"></span>And, after enumerating all his works
as if making an exact index, he added what follows:

<span id="vi.xi.iii.xxiv-p7"></span>“So you see the labours of this one
man have surpassed those of all previous writers both Greek and Latin.
Who has ever managed to read all that he has written? Yet what reward
have his exertions brought him? He stands condemned by his bishop,
Demetrius, only the bishops of Palestine, Arabia, Phœnicia, and Achaia
dissenting. Imperial Rome consents to his condemnation, and even
convenes a senate to censure him, not—as the rabid hounds who now pursue
him cry—because of the novelty or heterodoxy of his doctrines, but
because men could not tolerate the incomparable eloquence and knowledge,
which, when once he opened his lips, made others seem dumb.

<span id="vi.xi.iii.xxiv-p8"></span>I have written the above quickly and
incautiously, by the light of a poor lantern. You will see why, if you
think of those who to-day represent Epicurus and Aristippus.
