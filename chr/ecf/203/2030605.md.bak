id="v.iv.lxxxvi-p2.1"></span>Prosper <span
id="fr_2721"></span>[2722](#fn_2721.md) </span> of Aquitania, a man
scholastic in style and vigorous in statement, is said to have composed
many works, of which I have read a *Chronicle,* which bears his name,
and which extends from the creation of the first man, according to
Divine Scripture, until the death of the Emperor Valentinianus and the
taking of Rome by Genseric king of the Vandals. I regard as his also an
anonymous book against certain works of Cassianus, which the church of
God finds salutary, but which he brands as injurious, and in fact, some
of the opinions of Cassian and Prosper on the grace of God and on free
will are at variance with one another. Epistles of Pope Leo against
Eutyches, *On the true incarnation of Christ,* sent to various persons,
are also thought <span id="fr_2722"></span>[2723](#fn_2722.md) to have been
dictated by him.
