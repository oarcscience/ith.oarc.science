<span id="iv.x.xviii-p1"></span> *XVIII. To Neoptolemus.*

<span id="iv.x.xviii-p2"></span>Whenever I cast my eyes on the divine
law which calls those who are joined together in marriage “one
flesh,” <span id="fr_1645"></span>[1646](#fn_1645.md) I am at a <span
id="page_257">p. 257</span> <span id="iv.x.xviii-Page_257"></span>loss
how to comfort the limb that has been sundered, because I take account
of the greatness of the pang. But when I consider the course of nature,
and the law which the Creator has laid down in the words “Dust thou art
and to dust thou shalt return,” <span
id="fr_1646"></span>[1647](#fn_1646.md) and all that goes on daily in all
the world on land and sea—for either husbands first approach the end of
life or this lot first befalls the wives—I find from these reflections
many grounds of consolation; and above all the hopes that have been
given us by our Lord and Saviour. For the reason of the accomplishment
of the mystery of the incarnation was that we, being taught the defeat
of death, should no more grieve beyond measure at the loss by death of
those we love, but await the longed-for fulfilment of the hope of the
resurrection. I entreat your Excellency to reflect on these things, and
to overcome the pain of your grief; and all the more because the
children of your common love are with you, and give you every ground of
comfort. Let us then praise Him who governs our lives wisely, nor rouse
His anger by immoderate lamentation, for in His wisdom He knows what is
good for us, and in His mercy He gives it.
