Liberius the bishop, with Pancratius and Hilary, clergy of the Roman
church, to the emperor Constantius, as legates for the faith. When he
would not condemn the Nicene faith as represented by Athanasius, sent
again to Palestine, with wonderful constancy and willingness to meet
martyrdom, he wrote a book against the emperor Constantius and sent it
to be read by him, and not long after he returned to Cagliari in the
reign of the emperor Julian and died in the reign of Valentinian.
