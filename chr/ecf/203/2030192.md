<span id="iv.x.iii"></span>

<span id="iv.x.iii-p1"></span> *III. To Bishop Irenæus.* <span
id="fr_1609"></span>[1610](#fn_1609.md)

<span id="iv.x.iii-p3"></span>Comparisons of this kind are forbidden by
the divine Apostle. In his Epistle to the Romans he writes “Therefore
judge nothing before the time until the Lord come who both will bring to
light the hidden things of darkness and will make manifest the counsels
of the heart: and then shall every man have praise of God.” <span
id="fr_1610"></span>[1611](#fn_1610.md) And he is quite right; for we can
see only outward deeds, but the God of all knows also the intention of
the doers, and when He delivers his sentence judges not so much the work
as the will. So He will crown the divine Apostle who became to the Jews
as a Jew, to them that were under the law as under the law, and to them
that were without law as without law <span
id="fr_1611"></span>[1612](#fn_1611.md) for his object in thus assuming an
actor’s mask was that he might do good to mankind. His was no
time-server’s career. The gain he got was loss, but he secured the good
of them whom he taught. As I said, then, the divine Paul bids us wait
for the judgment of God. But we are venturing on high themes; we are
handling a theology passing understanding and words; not, like the
unholy heretics, seeking blasphemous positions, but endeavouring to
confute their impiety, and as far as in us lies to give praise to the
Creator; we shall therefore do nothing unreasonable in attempting to
reply to your enquiry.

<span id="iv.x.iii-p6"></span>You have suggested the case of an impious
judge giving to two athletes of piety the alternative of sacrificing to
demons, or flinging themselves into the sea. You describe the one as
choosing the latter and plunging without hesitation into the deep, while
the other, refusing both, shews quite as much abhorrence of the worship
of idols as his companion, but declines to commit himself to the waves,
and waits for this fate to be violently forced upon him. You have
suggested these circumstances, and you ask which of these two took the
better course. I think that you will agree with me that the latter was
the more praiseworthy. No one ought to withdraw himself from life
unbidden, but should await either a natural or a violent death. Our Lord
gave us this lesson when He bade those that are persecuted in one city
flee to another and again commanded them to quit even this and depart to
another. <span id="fr_1612"></span>[1613](#fn_1612.md) In obedience to this
teaching the divine Apostle escaped the violence <span id="page_251">p.
251</span> <span id="iv.x.iii-Page_251"></span>of the governor of the
city, and had no hesitation in speaking of the manner of his flight, but
spoke of the basket, the wall, and the window, and boasted and glorified
in the act. <span id="fr_1613"></span>[1614](#fn_1613.md) For what looks
discreditable is made honourable by the divine command. In the same
manner the Apostle called himself at one time a Pharisee <span
id="fr_1614"></span>[1615](#fn_1614.md) and at another a Roman, <span
id="fr_1615"></span>[1616](#fn_1615.md) not because he was afraid of death,
but acting quite fairly in fight. <span
id="fr_1616"></span>[1617](#fn_1616.md) In the same way when he had learnt
the Jews’ plot against him he appealed to Cæsar <span
id="fr_1617"></span>[1618](#fn_1617.md) and sent his sister’s son to the
chief captain to report the designs hatched against him, not because he
clung to this present life, but in obedience to the divine law. For
assuredly our Lord does not wish us to throw ourselves into obvious
peril; and this is taught us by deed as well as by word, for more than
once He avoided the murderous violence of the Jews. And the great Peter,
first of the Apostles, when he was loosed from his chains and had
escaped from the hands of Herod, came to the house of John, who was
surnamed Mark, and after removing the anxiety of his friends by his
visit and bidding them maintain silence, betook himself to another house
in the endeavour to conceal himself more effectually by the
removal. <span id="fr_1618"></span>[1619](#fn_1618.md) And we shall find
just the same kind of wisdom in the old Testament, for the famous Moses,
after playing the man in his struggle with the Egyptian and finding out
the next day that the homicide had become known, ran away, travelled a
long journey, and arrived at the land of Midian. <span
id="fr_1619"></span>[1620](#fn_1619.md) In like manner the great Elias when
he had learnt Jezebel’s threats did not give himself up to them which
wished to kill him, but left the world and hurried to the desert. <span
id="fr_1620"></span>[1621](#fn_1620.md) And if it is right and agreeable to
God to escape the violence of our enemies, surely it is much more right
to refuse to obey them when they order a man to become his own murderer.
Our Lord did not give in to the devil when he bade Him throw Himself
down, <span id="fr_1621"></span>[1622](#fn_1621.md) and when he had armed
against Him the hands of the Jews by means of the scourge and the thorns
and the nails, and the creature was urging Him to bring wholesale
destruction on His wicked foes, the Lord Himself forbade, because He
knew that His Passion was bringing salvation to the world, and it was
for this reason that just before His Passion He said to His Apostles
“Pray that ye enter not into temptation,” <span
id="fr_1622"></span>[1623](#fn_1622.md) and taught us to pray “Lead us not
into temptation.” <span id="fr_1623"></span>[1624](#fn_1623.md) Now let us
shift our ground a little, and we shall see our way more clearly. Let us
eliminate the sea from the argument, and suppose the judge to have given
each of the martyrs a sword, and ordered the one who refused to
sacrifice to cut off his own head; who in his senses would have endured
to redden his hand with his own blood, become his own headsman, lift his
hand against himself, in obedience to the judge’s order?

<span id="iv.x.iii-p19"></span>Clearly your second martyr deserves the
higher praise. The former indeed deserves credit for his zeal, but the
latter is adorned by right judgment as well.

<span id="iv.x.iii-p20"></span>I have answered you according to the
measure of the wisdom given me; He who knows thoughts as well as acts,
will shew which of the two was right in the day of His appearing.
