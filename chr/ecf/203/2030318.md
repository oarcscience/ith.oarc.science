<span id="iv.x.cxxix-p1"></span> *CXXVIII. To Candidus, Presbyter and
Archimandrite.* <span id="fr_1933"></span>[1934](#fn_1933.md)

<span id="iv.x.cxxix-p3"></span>I am afraid that the vigour of your
godly soul has been overcome by old age, and that you do not keep your
hands stretched out as usual. So Amalek is trying to win. May there be
some to succour your weakness, as once of old Ur and Aaron supported the
<span id="page_301">p. 301</span> <span
id="iv.x.cxxix-Page_301"></span>hands of the law-giver, that you may
overthrow Amalek and save Israel. These are days when we specially need
more earnest prayers, when Gentiles and Jews and every heresy are at
peace, and the Church alone is beaten by the storm and surrounded by the
boisterous billows.

<span id="iv.x.cxxix-p4"></span>We indeed specially need the aid of your
prayers, for those whom we reckoned to be fighting on our side are
fighting on that of our foes.
