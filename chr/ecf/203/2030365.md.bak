<span id="iv.x.clxxvi-p1"></span> *CLXXV. To Alexander of
Hierapolis*. <span id="fr_2305"></span>[2306](#fn_2305.md)

<span id="iv.x.clxxvi-p3"></span>I have already informed your holiness
that if the doctrine of the very holy and venerable bishop, my lord
Nestorius, is condemned, I will not communicate with those who do so. If
it shall please your holiness to insert this in the letter which is
being sent to Antioch so be it. Let there then, I beseech you, be no
delay!
