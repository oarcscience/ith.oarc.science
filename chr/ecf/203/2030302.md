<span id="iv.x.cxiii-p1"></span> <span id="page_293">p. 293</span> <span
id="iv.x.cxiii-Page_293"></span>*CXIII. To Leo, Bishop of Rome. <span
id="fr_1876"></span>[1877](#fn_1876.md)*

<span id="iv.x.cxiii-p3"></span>If Paul, the herald of the truth, the
trumpet of the Holy Ghost, hastened to the great Peter <span
id="fr_1877"></span>[1878](#fn_1877.md) in order that he might carry from
him the desired solution of difficulties to those at Antioch who were in
doubt about living in conformity with the law, much more do we, men
insignificant and small, hasten to your apostolic see <span
id="fr_1878"></span>[1879](#fn_1878.md) in order to receive from you a cure
for the wounds of the churches. For every reason it is fitting for you
to hold the first place, inasmuch as your see is adorned with many
privileges. Other cities are indeed adorned by their size, their beauty,
and their population; and some which in these respects are lacking are
made bright by certain spiritual boons. But on your city the great
Provider has bestowed an abundance of good gifts. She is the largest,
the most splendid, the most illustrious of the world, and overflows with
the multitude of her inhabitants. Besides all this, she has achieved her
present sovereignty, and has given her name to her subjects. She is
moreover specially adorned by her faith, in due testimony whereof the
divine Apostle exclaims “your faith is spoken of throughout the whole
world.” <span id="fr_1879"></span>[1880](#fn_1879.md) And if even after
receiving the seeds of the message of salvation her boughs were
straightway heavy with these admirable fruits, what words can fitly
praise the piety now practised in her? In her keeping too are the tombs
that give light to the souls of the faithful, those of our common
fathers and teachers of the truth, Peter and Paul. <span
id="fr_1880"></span>[1881](#fn_1880.md) This thrice blessed and divine pair
arose in the region of sunrise, and spread their rays in all directions.
Now from the region of sunset, where they willingly welcomed the setting
of this life, they illuminate the world. They have rendered your see
most glorious; this is the crown and completion <span
id="fr_1881"></span>[1882](#fn_1881.md) of your good things; but in these
days their God has adorned their throne <span
id="fr_1882"></span>[1883](#fn_1882.md) by setting on it your holiness,
emitting, as you do, the rays of orthodoxy. Of this I might give many
proofs, but it is enough to mention the zeal which your holiness lately
shewed against the ill-famed Manichees, proving thereby your piety’s
earnest regard for divine things. Your recent writings, too, are enough
to indicate your apostolic character. For we have met with what your
holiness has written concerning the incarnation <span
id="fr_1883"></span>[1884](#fn_1883.md) of our God and Saviour, and we have
marvelled at the exactness of your expressions.

<span id="iv.x.cxiii-p11"></span>For both writings agreed in setting
forth both the everlasting Godhead of the Only-begotten derived from the
everlasting Father, and the manhood derived from the seed of Abraham and
David; and that the nature assumed was in all things like unto us, being
unlike to us in this respect alone, that it remained free from all sin;
since it springs not of nature but of free will.

<span id="iv.x.cxiii-p12"></span>The letters moreover contain this, that
the Only-begotten Son of God is one, and his Godhead impassible,
immutable, and invariable, like the Father who begat Him and the Holy
Spirit; and that on this account He took the passible nature, divine
nature being incapable of suffering, that by the suffering of His own
flesh He might bestow freedom from suffering on them that have believed
in Him. These statements and others of like nature were contained in
your letters. We, in admiration of your spiritual wisdom, have lauded
the grace of the Holy Ghost uttered through you, and we invoke and
beseech and beg and implore your highness to protect the churches of God
that are now assailed by the storm.

<span id="iv.x.cxiii-p13"></span>We had expected that through the
instrumentality of the representatives <span
id="fr_1884"></span>[1885](#fn_1884.md) sent by your holiness to Ephesus,
the tempest <span id="page_294">p. 294</span> <span
id="iv.x.cxiii-Page_294"></span>would have been done away, but we have
fallen under severer attacks of the storm. For the very righteous bishop
of Alexandria was not content with the illegal and very unrighteous
deposition of the most holy and godly bishop of Constantinople, the lord
Flavianus, nor was his soul satisfied with a similar slaughter of the
rest of the bishops, but me too in my absence he stabbed with a pen,
without summoning me to the bar, without trying me in my presence,
without questioning me as to my opinions about the incarnation of our
God and Saviour. Even murderers, tomb-breakers, and adulterers, are not
condemned by their judges until they have themselves confirmed by
confession the charges brought against them, or have been clearly
convicted by the testimony of others. Yet I, nurtured as I have been in
the divine laws, have been condemned by him at his pleasure, when all
the while I was five and thirty days’ march away.

<span id="iv.x.cxiii-p15"></span>Nor is this all that he has done. Only
last year when two fellows tainted with the unsoundness of Apollinarius
had gone thither and patched up slanders against me, he stood up in
church and anathematized me, and that after I had written to him and
explained my opinions to him.

<span id="iv.x.cxiii-p16"></span>I lament the disturbance of the church,
and long for peace. Six and twenty years have I ruled the church
entrusted to me by the God of all, aided by your prayers. Never in the
time of the blessed Theodotus, <span
id="fr_1885"></span>[1886](#fn_1885.md) the chief bishop of the East; never
in the time of his successors in the see of Antioch, did I incur the
slightest blame. By the help of God’s grace working with me more than a
thousand souls did I rescue from the plague of Marcion; many others from
the Arian and Eunomian factions did I bring over to our Master Christ. I
have done pastoral duty in eight hundred churches, for so many parishes
does Cyrus contain; and in them, through your prayers, not even one tare
is left, and our flock is delivered from all heresy and error. He who
sees all things knows how many stones have been cast at me by evil
heretics, how many conflicts in most of the cities of the East I have
waged against pagans, against Jews, against every heresy. After all this
trial and all this danger I have been condemned without a trial.

<span id="iv.x.cxiii-p18"></span>But I await the sentence of your
apostolic see. I beseech and implore your holiness to succour me in my
appeal to your fair and righteous tribunal. Bid me hasten to you, and
prove to you that my teaching follows the footprints of the apostles. I
have in my possession what I wrote twenty years ago; what I wrote
eighteen, fifteen, twelve, years ago; against Arians and Eunomians,
against Jews and pagans; against the magi in Persia; on divine
Providence; on theology; and on the divine incarnation. By God’s grace I
have interpreted the writings of the apostles and the oracles of the
prophets. From these it is not difficult to ascertain whether I have
adhered to the right rule of faith, or have swerved from its straight
course. Do not, I implore you, spurn my prayer; regard, I implore you,
the insults piled after all my labours on my poor grey head.

<span id="iv.x.cxiii-p19"></span>Above all, I implore you to tell me
whether I ought to put up with this unrighteous deposition or not; for I
await your decision. If you bid me abide by the sentence of
condemnation, I abide; and henceforth I will trouble no man, and will
wait for the righteous tribunal of our God and Saviour. God is my
witness, my lord, that I care not for honour and glory. I care only for
the scandal that has been caused, in that many of the simpler folk, and
especially those whom I have rescued from various heresies, cleaving to
the authority of my judges and quite unable to understand the exact
truth of the doctrine, will perhaps suppose me guilty of heresy.

<span id="iv.x.cxiii-p20"></span>All the people of the East know that
during all the time of my episcopate I have not acquired a house, not a
piece of ground, not an obol, not a tomb, but of my own accord have
embraced poverty, after distributing, at the death of my parents, the
whole of the property which I inherited from them.

<span id="iv.x.cxiii-p21"></span>Above all I implore you, O holy sir,
beloved of God, to grant me the help of your prayers. I have told you
this by the reverend and godly presbyters Hypatius and Abramius
chorepiscopi <span id="fr_1886"></span>[1887](#fn_1886.md) and by Alypius
exarch <span id="fr_1887"></span>[1888](#fn_1887.md) of our monks. I would
hasten to you myself were I not kept back by the chains of the imperial
order, which imprison me as they do others. Treat my messengers, I
beseech you, as a father might his sons; give them kindly and unbiassed
audience; deign to grant your protection to my old age, <span
id="fr_1888"></span>[1889](#fn_1888.md) slandered as it is and attacked in
vain. Above all, regard, to the utmost of your power, the faith
conspired against; preserve for the churches the inheritance of their
fathers un<span id="page_295">p. 295</span> <span
id="iv.x.cxiii-Page_295"></span>impaired. So will your holiness receive
the recompense due for such deeds from the great Giver of all good
gifts. <span id="fr_1889"></span>[1890](#fn_1889.md)

<span id="fn_1876"></span>[293:1877](2030302.htm#fr_1876.md) <span
id="iv.x.cxiii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.x.cxiii-p2"></span> This celebrated letter may be dated
towards the end of 449, allowing time for news to reach Theodoret of his
deposition at the Latrocinium on August 11. In 445 Leo had procured the
well known decree from Valentinian III, addressed to the famous Aetius
in connexion with the dispute with Hilary of Arles, constituting the
bishop of Rome the chief authority in the Western Church, basing his
demands not so much on the recognised precedence of the imperial see as
on the supposed primacy of St. Peter. But in 451, only two years after
the date of Theodoret’s letter the council of Chalcedon (Can. xxviii),
after recording the canon (iii) of Constantinople that “the bishop of
Constantinople shall have the primacy of honour after the bishop of
Rome, because that Constantinople is new Rome,” added “we decree the
same things concerning the privileges of Constantinople, which is new
Rome. The Fathers formerly gave the primacy to the see of old Rome,
because she was the imperial city, and gave like privileges to new Rome,
rightly judging that the city which enjoyed like imperial privileges
should also be honoured in matters ecclesiastical, being next in rank.”
We are yet very far from later claims. Indeed even Gregory the Great
when he protested against the title of œcumenical bishop, assumed by
John the Faster, did not claim it for himself.

<span id="fn_1877"></span>[293:1878](2030302.htm#fr_1877.md) <span
id="iv.x.cxiii-p3.1"></span>

<span id="iv.x.cxiii-p4"></span> Paul and Barnabas went up to Jerusalem,
not to Peter, but “unto the Apostles and elders.” <span
id="iv.x.cxiii-p4.1"></span>[Acts xv.
2](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#002.md)<span id="iv.x.cxiii-p4.2"></span>.
Peter took a leading part in the discussion, but the “sentence” was
pronounced not by Peter, but by James, and the decree was that of “the
Apostles and elders with the whole Church.” The slight “wresting” of the
scriptures of which Theodoret is guilty is due rather to a desire to
compliment an important personage than in anticipation of later
controversies.

<span id="fn_1878"></span>[293:1879](2030302.htm#fr_1878.md) <span

<span id="iv.x.cxiii-p7"></span> The traditional places of sepulture
are, of half of each of the holy bodies, the shrine of SS. Peter and
Paul in the crypt of St. Peter’s; of the remaining moiety of St. Peter
the Lateran; of St. Paul, St. Paolo fuori le Mura.

id="iv.x.cxiii-p8.2"></span>

<span id="iv.x.cxiii-p9"></span> St. Paul is treated as in a sense
bishop of Rome. The idea may have some bearing on the hypothesis
sometimes adopted, to avoid the difficulties in the early Roman
succession, that there was a Gentile line derived from St. Paul, who
ordained Linus, and after him Cletus; and that for the Jewish brethren
St. Peter ordained Clement.

He is not known to have written any large treatise.

<span id="iv.x.cxiii-p14"></span> Dioscorus presided, and next him sat
Julius of Puteoli, who in company with the presbyter Renatus, and the
deacon Hilarius (successor to Leo in the papacy) had carried to Flavian
the famous “tome” of Leo in June 449. Leo (Epp. XXXII. and XXXIV.)
describes his legates as sent *“de latere meo.”* According to one
version of the story Renatus died at Delos on the way out. Labbe IV.
1079.

<span id="fn_1885"></span>[294:1886](2030302.htm#fr_1885.md) <span
id="iv.x.cxiii-p16.1"></span>

<span id="iv.x.cxiii-p17"></span> Patriarch at Antioch 420–429.

<span id="fn_1886"></span>[294:1887](2030302.htm#fr_1886.md) <span
id="iv.x.cxiii-p21.1"></span>

<span id="iv.x.cxiii-p22"></span> No word exactly renders the title of
these ministers, discharging functions of an episcopal kind, though
without high responsibility. They are first mentioned in the Councils of
Ancyra and of Neo-Cæsarea and fifteen of them subscribed the decrees of
Nicæa.

<span id="fn_1887"></span>[294:1888](2030302.htm#fr_1887.md) <span
id="iv.x.cxiii-p22.1"></span>

<span id="iv.x.cxiii-p23"></span> Exarch, in its most ordinary
ecclesiastical sense nearly equivalent to patriarch, came also to be
used of officers charged with the visitation of monasteries.

<span id="fn_1888"></span>[294:1889](2030302.htm#fr_1888.md) <span
id="iv.x.cxiii-p23.1"></span>

<span id="iv.x.cxiii-p24"></span> If born in 386 (Garnerius), Theodoret
would now be 63. Tillemont says 393.

<span id="fn_1889"></span>[295:1890](2030302.htm#fr_1889.md) <span
id="iv.x.cxiii-p24.1"></span>

<span id="iv.x.cxiii-p25"></span> The tone of this letter, it need
hardly be said, is quite inconsistent with the later idea of an “appeal
to Rome.” It is “an appeal,” but the appeal of a wronged man for the
support, succour, and advice, of a brother bishop of the highest
position and character. It does not on the face of it suggest that Leo
has any authority to review or alter the sentence of the council.
Tillemont (Mém. Ecc. xv. 294<span id="iv.x.cxiii-p25.1"></span>)
observes that though addressed to Leo in person the appeal is really
made to the bishops of the West in council. Leo remonstrated, but
Theodosius and his court maintained that the decrees of the Latrocinium
must stand.
