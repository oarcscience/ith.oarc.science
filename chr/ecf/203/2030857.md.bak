<span id="vi.xiii.ix-p1"></span> 8. Then further it is to be observed
that no creature can be such as its Creator. And therefore, as the
divine substance or essence admits of no comparison, so neither does the
Divinity. Moreover, every creature is of nothing. If therefore a spark
which is so unsubstantial but yet is fire, begets of itself a creature
which is of nothing, and maintains in it the essential nature of that
from which it springs, (i.e. the fire of the parent spark), why could
not the substance of that eternal Light which ever has been because it
has in itself nothing which is not substantial, produce from itself
substantial brightness? Rightly, therefore, is the Son called “only,”
“unique.” For He who hath been so born is “only” and “unique.” That
which is unique can admit of no comparison. Nor can He who made all
things be like in substance to the things which He has made. This then
is Christ Jesus, the only Son of God, who is also our Lord. “Only” may
be referred both to Son and to Lord. For Jesus Christ is “only” both as
truly Son and as one Lord. For all other sons, though they are called
sons, are so called by the grace of adoption, not by verity of nature;
and if there be others who are called lords, they are called so from an
authority bestowed not inherent. But Christ alone is the only Son and
the only Lord, as the Apostle saith, “One Lord Jesus Christ, by Whom are
all things.” <span id="fr_3275"></span>[3276](#fn_3275.md) Therefore, after
the Creed has in due order set forth the ineffable mystery of the
nativity of the Son from the Father, it now descends to the dispensation
which He vouchsafed to enter upon for man’s salvation. And of Him whom
just now it called the “only Son of God” and “our Lord,” it now says.
