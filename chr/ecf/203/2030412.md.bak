id="v.iii.xxxi-p2.1"></span>Tatian <span
id="fr_2429"></span>[2430](#fn_2429.md) </span> who, while teaching
oratory, won not a little glory in the rhetorical art, was a follower of
Justin Martyr and was distinguished so long as he did not leave his
master’s side. But afterwards, inflated <span
id="fr_2430"></span>[2431](#fn_2430.md) by a swelling of eloquence, he
founded a new heresy which is called that of the Encratites, the heresy
which Severus afterwards augmented in such wise that heretics of this
party are called Severians to the present day. Tatian wrote besides
innumerable volumes, one of which, a most successful book *Against the
nations,* is extant, and this is considered the most significant of all
his works. He flourished in the reign of Marcus Antoninus Verus and
Lucius Aurelius Commodus.
