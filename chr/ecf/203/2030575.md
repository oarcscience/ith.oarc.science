<span id="v.iv.lvi-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="v.iv.lvi-p2.1"></span>Caelestinus, <span
id="fr_2666"></span>[2667](#fn_2666) </span> bishop of Rome, addressed a
volume to the churches of the East and West, giving an account of the
decree of the synod against the above mentioned Nestorius and
maintaining that while there are two complete natures in Christ, the
person of the Son of God is to be regarded as single. The above
mentioned Nestorius was shown to be opposed to this view. Xystus
likewise, the successor of Caelestinus, wrote on the same subject and to
the same Nestorius and the Eastern bishops, giving the views of the
Western bishops against his error.
