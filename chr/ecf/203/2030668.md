<span id="vi.xi.ii.xxxi-p1"></span> 30. But let us proceed in our study
of these Commentaries; otherwise, in dwelling too long upon a few
special points, we may be prevented from taking notice of the greater
number. In the same book and the same passage <span
id="fr_2873"></span>[2874](#fn_2873) are the words “To the end that we
should be unto the praise of his glory, we who had before hoped in
Christ.” His comment is:

<span id="vi.xi.ii.xxxi-p3"></span>“If it had been simply said ‘We have
trusted in Christ,’ and there had not been the prefix ‘before,’ which
stands in the Greek <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xi.ii.xxxi-p3.1"></span>προηλπικότες</span>, the sense would be
quite clear, namely, that those who have hoped in Christ have been
chosen in due order <span id="fr_2874"></span>[2875](#fn_2874) and have
been predestinated according to the purpose of him who orders all things
according to the counsel of his own will. But, as it stands, the
addition of the preposition ‘before,’ compels us to explain it according
to the same ideas which we argued in a former place to be necessary for
the explanation of the passage, “Who hath blessed us with every
spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ, even as he chose us
in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and
without blemish before him:” namely, that God had blessed us before in
heaven with all spiritual blessing, and had chosen us before the world
was framed; and that thus we are said to have hoped in Christ ‘before,’
that is, in the time when we were elected and predestinated and blessed
in heaven.”
