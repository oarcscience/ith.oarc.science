<span id="iv.viii.ii.xxv-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.ii.xxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXV</span>.—*Of the causes which
separated the Eunomians from the Arians*.

<span id="iv.viii.ii.xxv-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.ii.xxv-p2.1"></span>Eunomius</span> in his writings praises
Aetius, styles him a man of God, and honours him with many compliments.
Yet he was at that time closely associated with the party by whom Aetius
had been repudiated, and to them he owed his election to his bishopric.

<span id="iv.viii.ii.xxv-p3"></span>Now the followers of Eudoxius and
Acacius, who had assented to the decrees put forth at Nice in Thrace,
already mentioned in this history, appointed other bishops in the
churches of the adherents of Basilius and Eleusius in their stead. On
other points I think it superfluous to write in detail. I purpose only
to relate what concerns Eunomius.

<span id="iv.viii.ii.xxv-p4"></span>For when Eunomius had seized on the
see of Cyzicus in the lifetime of Eleusius, Eudoxius urged him to hide
his opinions and not make them known to the party who were seeking a
pretext to persecute him. Eudoxius was moved to offer this advice both
by his knowledge that the diocese was sound in the faith and his
experience of the anger manifested by Constantius against the party who
asserted the only begotten Son of God to be a created being. “Let us”
said he to Eunomius “bide our time; when it comes we will preach what
now we are keeping dark; educate the ignorant; and win over or compel or
punish our opponents.” Eunomius, yielding to these suggestions,
propounded his impious doctrine under the shadow of obscurity. Those of
his hearers who had been nurtured on the divine oracles saw clearly that
his utterances concealed under their surface a foul fester of
error. <span id="fr_580"></span>[581](#fn_580.md)

<span id="iv.viii.ii.xxv-p6"></span>But however distressed they were
they considered it less the part of prudence than of rashness to make
any open protest, so they assumed a mask of heretical heterodoxy, and
paid a visit to the bishop at his private residence with the earnest
request that he would have regard to the distress of men borne hither
and thither by different doctrines, and would plainly expound the truth.
Eunomius thus emboldened declared the sentiments which he secretly held.
The deputation then went on to remark that it was unfair and indeed
quite wrong for the whole of his diocese to be prevented from having
their share of the truth. By these and similar arguments he was induced
to lay bare his blasphemy in the public assemblies of the church. Then
his opponents hurried with angry fervour to Constantinople; first they
indicted him before Eudoxius, and when Eudoxius refused to see them,
sought an audience of the emperor and made lamentation over the ruin
their bishop was wreaking among them. “The sermons of Eunomius,” they
said, “are more impious than the blasphemies of Arius.” The wrath of
Constantius was roused, and he commanded Eudoxius to send for Eunomius,
and, on his conviction, to strip him of his bishopric. Eudoxius, of
course, though again and again importuned by the accusers, continued to
delay taking action. Then once more they approached the emperor with
vociferous complaints that Eudoxius had not obeyed the imperial commands
in any single particular, and was perfectly indifferent to the delivery
of an important city to the blasphemies of Eunomius. Then said
Constantius to Eudoxius, if you do not fetch Eunomius and try him, and
on conviction of the charges brought against him, punish him, I shall
exile you. This threat frightened Eudoxius, so he wrote to Eunomius to
escape from Cyzicus, and told him he had only himself to blame because
he had not followed the hints given him. Eunomius accordingly withdrew
in alarm, but he could not endure the disgrace, and endeavoured to fix
the guilt of his betrayal on Eudoxius, maintaining that both he and
Aetius had been cruelly treated. And from that time he set up a sect of
his own for all the men who were of his way of thinking and condemned
his betrayal, separated from Eudoxius and joined with Eunomius, whose
name they bear up to this day. So Eunomius became the founder of a
heresy, and added to the blasphemy of Arius by his own peculiar guilt.
He set up a sect of his own because he was a slave to his ambition, as
the facts distinctly prove. For when Aetius was condemned and exiled,
Eunomius <span id="page_91">p. 91</span> <span
id="iv.viii.ii.xxv-Page_91"></span>refused to accompany him, though he
called him his master and a man of God, but remained closely associated
with Eudoxius.

<span id="iv.viii.ii.xxv-p7"></span>But when his turn came he paid the
penalty of his iniquity; he did not submit to the vote of the synod, but
began to ordain bishops and presbyters, though himself deprived of his
episcopal rank. These then were the deeds done at Constantinople.
