<span id="vi.xi.ii.ii"></span>

<span id="vi.xi.ii.ii-p1"></span> I have read the document sent from the
East by our friend and good brother to a distinguished member of the
Senate, Pammachius, which you have copied and forwarded to me. It
brought to my mind the words of the Prophet: <span
id="fr_2816"></span>[2817](#fn_2816.md) “The sons of men whose teeth are
spears and arrows and their tongue a sharp sword.” But for these wounds
which men inflict on one another with the tongue we can hardly find a
physician; so I have betaken myself to Jesus, the heavenly physician,
and he has brought out for me from the medicine chest of the Gospel an
antidote of sovereign power; he has assuaged the violence of my grief
with the assurance of the righteous judgment which I shall have at his
hands. The potion which our Lord dispensed to me was nothing else than
these words: <span id="fr_2817"></span>[2818](#fn_2817.md) “Blessed are ye
when men persecute you and say all manner of evil against you falsely.
Rejoice and leap for joy, for great is your reward in heaven, for so
persecuted they the Prophets which were before you.” With this medicine
I was content, and, as far as the matter concerned me, I had determined
for the future to keep silence; for I said within myself, <span
id="fr_2818"></span>[2819](#fn_2818.md) “If they have called the Master of
the house Beelzebub, how much more them of his household?” (that is, you
and me, unworthy though we are). And, if it was said of him, <span
id="fr_2819"></span>[2820](#fn_2819.md) “He is a deceiver, he deceiveth the
people,” I must not be indignant if I hear that I am called a heretic,
and that the name of mole is applied to me because of the slowness of my
mind, or indeed my blindness. Christ who is my Lord, aye, and who is God
over all, was called <span id="fr_2820"></span>[2821](#fn_2820.md) “a
gluttonous man and a wine bibber, a friend of publicans and sinners.”
How can I, then, be angry when I am called a carnal man <span
id="fr_2821"></span>[2822](#fn_2821.md) who lives in luxury?
