<span id="iv.viii.ii.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.ii.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VIII</span>.—*Stephanus
Deposed*.

<span id="iv.viii.ii.viii-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.ii.viii-p2.1"></span>After</span> the judges had heard these
replies, they ordered the youngest of those who had been arrested to be
brought before them. Before he was subjected to the examination by
scourging, he confessed the whole plot, and stated that it was planned
and carried into execution by Onager. On this latter being brought in he
affirmed that he had only acted according to the commands of Stephanus.
The guilt of Stephanus being thus demonstrated, the bishops then present
were charged to depose him, and expel him from the Church. By his
expulsion the Church was not, however, wholly freed from the plague of
Arianism. Leontius, who succeeded him in his presidency, was a Phrygian
of so subtle and artful a disposition, that he might be said to resemble
the sunken rocks of the sea <span id="fr_496"></span>[497](#fn_496.md) . We
shall presently narrate more concerning him <span

<span id="iv.viii.ii.viii-p6"></span> Leontius, Bishop of Antioch from
<span class="c14"><span id="iv.viii.ii.viii-p6.1"></span>a.d.</span> 348
to 357, was one of the School of Lucianus. (Philost. iii. 15), cf. pp.
38 and 41, notes. Athanasius says hard things of him (*de fug.* §26),
but Dr. Salmon (*Dict. Christ. Biog.* s.v.) is of opinion that “we may
charitably think that the gentleness and love of peace which all attest
were not mere hypocrisy, and may impute his toleration of heretics to no
worse cause than insufficient appreciation of the importance of the
issues involved.” Vide infra. chap. xix.
