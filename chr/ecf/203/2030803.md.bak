<span id="vi.xii.iii.i"></span>

<span id="vi.xii.iii.i-p1"></span> <span class="c21"><span
id="vi.xii.iii.i-p1.1"></span>Book III.</span>

<span id="vi.xii.iii.i-p2"></span>The two first books formed a complete
whole, but it was intimated that there might be more to come when Jerome
should have received Rufinus’ work in full. The two first books were
brought to Rufinus by the captain of a merchant-ship trading with
Aquileia, together with a copy of Jerome’s friendly letter which had
been suppressed by Pammachius. The bearer had (as stated by Rufinus,
though Jerome mocks at this as impossible) only two days to wait.
Chromatius the Bishop of Aquileia urged that the strife should now
cease, and prevailed so far as that Rufinus made no public reply. He
wrote a private letter, however, to Jerome, which has not come down to
us, and which does not seem, from the extracts given in c. 4, 6, etc.,
to have been of a pacific tenor. Its details may be gathered from
Jerome’s reply. Jerome intimates that it sought to involve him in
heresy, that it renewed and aggravated the former accusations, speaking
of him in language fit only for the lowest characters on the stage; and
that it declared that, if its writer had been so minded, he could have
produced facts which would have been the destruction of his adversary.
Jerome, though receiving some expressions of the desire of Chromatius
that he should not reply (perhaps also the regretful expostulation of
Augustin,—Jer. Letter cx, 6, Aug. Letter 73) declared that it was
impossible for him to yield. He could not refrain from defending himself
from a capital charge, nor could he spare the heretics. Peace could only
come by unity in the faith.

<span id="vi.xii.iii.i-p3"></span>1. Your letter is full of falsehood
and violence. I will try not to take the same tone.

<span id="vi.xii.iii.i-p4"></span>2. Why cannot we differ as friends?
Why do you, by threats of death, compel me to answer?

<span id="vi.xii.iii.i-p5"></span>3, 4. Your shameful taunt that I
wished to get copies of your Apology by bribing your Secretary is an
imputation to me of practices which are your own.

<span id="vi.xii.iii.i-p6"></span>5. Eusebius should not have accused
you; but your charges against him will not stand.

<span id="vi.xii.iii.i-p7"></span>6. You taunt me with boasting of my
eloquence. Will you boast of your illiteracy?

<span id="vi.xii.iii.i-p8"></span>7, 8. You wish first to praise, then
to amend me, but both with fisticuffs; and make it impossible for me to
keep silence.

<span id="vi.xii.iii.i-p9"></span>9. Why cannot you join with me in
condemning Origen, and so put an end to our quarrel?

<span id="vi.xii.iii.i-p10"></span>10. The assertion that you had only
two days for your answer is a fiction.

<span id="vi.xii.iii.i-p11"></span>11. Your translation, contrariwise to
my Commentaries, vouches for the soundness of Origen.

<span id="vi.xii.iii.i-p12"></span>12. You try to shield Origen by
falsely attributing the Apology for him to Pamphilus.

<span id="vi.xii.iii.i-p13"></span>13. In my Commentaries my quotation
of opposite opinions shows that neither is mine.

<span id="vi.xii.iii.i-p14"></span>14. Had you translated honestly, you
would not have had Origen’s heresies imputed to you.

<span id="vi.xii.iii.i-p15"></span>15. You say the Bishops of Italy
accept your views on the Resurrection. I doubt it.

<span id="vi.xii.iii.i-p16"></span>16. You rashly say that you will
agree to whatever Theophilus lays down. You have to consider your
friendship for Isidore now his enemy.

<span id="vi.xii.iii.i-p17"></span>17, 18. You speak of the Egyptian
Bishop Paul. We received him, though an Origenist, as a stranger; and he
has united himself to the orthodox faith. Not only Theophilus but the
Emperors condemn Origen.

<span id="vi.xii.iii.i-p18"></span>19. Against Vigilantius I wrote only
what was right. I knew who had stirred him up against me.

<span id="vi.xii.iii.i-p19"></span>20. As to the letter of Pope
Anastasius condemning you, you will find that it is genuine.

<span id="vi.xii.iii.i-p20"></span>21. Siricius who is dead may have
written in your favour; Anastasius who is living writes to the East
against you.

<span id="vi.xii.iii.i-p21"></span>22. My departure from Rome for the
East had nothing blameable in it as you insinuate.

<span id="vi.xii.iii.i-p22"></span>23. Epiphanius, it is true, gave you
the kiss of peace; but he showed afterwards that he had come to distrust
you.

<span id="vi.xii.iii.i-p23"></span>24. When we parted as friends I
believed you a true believer; no one was sent to Rome to injure you.

<span id="vi.xii.iii.i-p24"></span>25. You swear that you did not write
my pretended retractation. Your style betrays you, and I have given a
full answer about my translations already.

<span id="vi.xii.iii.i-p25"></span>26. You bid me beware of
falsification and treachery. You warn me against yourself.

<span id="vi.xii.iii.i-p26"></span>27. There is nothing inconsistent in
praising a man for some things and blaming him in others. You have done
it in my case.

<span id="vi.xii.iii.i-p27"></span><span id="page_519">p. 519</span>
<span id="vi.xii.iii.i-Page_519"></span>28–31. My ignorance of many
natural phenomena is no excuse for your ignorance as to the origin of
souls. You ought, according to your boasting dream to know everything.
The thing of most importance was forgotten in your cargo of Eastern
wares.

<span id="vi.xii.iii.i-p28"></span>32. Your dream was a boast: mine of
which you accuse me humbled me.

<span id="vi.xii.iii.i-p29"></span>33. It was not I who first disclosed
your heresies, but Epiphanius long ago and Aterbius before him.

<span id="vi.xii.iii.i-p30"></span>34–36. As to our translations of the
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xii.iii.i-p30.1"></span>Περὶ
᾽Αρχῶν</span>, yours was doing harm, and mine was necessary in
self-defence. You should be glad that heresy is exposed.

<span id="vi.xii.iii.i-p31"></span>37. Your Apology for Origen did not
save him but involved you in heresy.

<span id="vi.xii.iii.i-p32"></span>38. My friendly letter was to prevent
discord: the other to crush false opinions.

<span id="vi.xii.iii.i-p33"></span>39, 40. Pythagoras was rightly quoted
by me. I produce some of his sayings.

<span id="vi.xii.iii.i-p34"></span>41, 42. You threaten me with
destruction. I will not reply in the same way. Personalities should be
excluded from controversies of faith.

<span id="vi.xii.iii.i-p35"></span>43, 44. The way of peace is through
the wisdom taught in the Book of Proverbs, and through unity in the
faith.
