<span id="iv.x.cxlv-p1"></span> *CXLIV. To the Soldiers.* <span
id="fr_1995"></span>[1996](#fn_1995.md)

<span id="iv.x.cxlv-p3"></span>Human nature is everywhere the same, but
pursuits in life are many and various. Some men prefer a sailor’s
career, some a soldier’s; some men become athletes, some husbandmen;
some ply one craft and some another. To pass by all other differences,
some men are zealous and diligent about divine things, and get
themselves instructed in the exact teaching of the apostolic doctrines;
while others, on the contrary, become slaves of the belly, and suppose
that the enjoyment of base pleasures is happiness. Others again are
there, lying in a mean between these two extremes, who do not exhibit
this praiseworthy enthusiasm, nor embrace a life of incontinence, but
still honour the simplicity of the faith. Men who attack the statement
that some things are altogether impossible with God must not, I
apprehend, be classed with the zealous and the well instructed in divine
things, but rather either with those who have no exact knowledge of the
apostolic doctrines, or those who have been enslaved by pleasures and
shift hither and thither at the caprice of a moment, setting forth now
one thing and now another.

<span id="iv.x.cxlv-p4"></span>You have asked me to write on these
points. I should prefer at the present time to keep silence. But in
obedience to the commandment of the Lord, “Give to every man that asketh
of thee,” <span id="fr_1996"></span>[1997](#fn_1996.md) I am constrained
briefly to reply.

<span id="iv.x.cxlv-p6"></span>I say then that the God of the universe
can do all things, but that in the word “all” is comprehended only what
is right and good, for He who is naturally both wise and good admits of
nothing that is of a contrary nature, but only what becomes his nature.
If any objectors gainsay this statement, ask them if the God of the
universe, the lawgiver of <span id="page_311">p. 311</span> <span
id="iv.x.cxlv-Page_311"></span>truth, can lie. If they say that lying is
possible to God, expel them from your company as impious and
blasphemous. Should they agree that lying is not possible to the God of
the universe, ask them in the second place, if He who is the fount of
justice can become unjust. Should they allow that this too is impossible
to the God of all, you must yet again enquire if the unfathomable depth
of wisdom can become unwise, God cease to be God, the Lord cease to be
the Lord, the Creator be no Creator, the Good not good but evil and the
true Light not light but its opposite. If they admit that all these
things and the like are impossible to God, you must say to them
therefore many things are impossible with God; and that their being
impossible so far from being a proof of want of power, indicates on the
contrary the greatest power.

<span id="iv.x.cxlv-p7"></span>Even in the case of our own soul, when we
say that it cannot die, we do not predicate weakness of it, but we
proclaim its capacity of immortality. And similarly when we confess the
immutability, impassibility, and immortality of God, we cannot attribute
to the divine nature change, passion, or death. Suppose them to urge
that God can do whatever He will, you must reply to them that He wishes
to do nothing which it is not His nature to do; He is by nature good,
therefore He does not wish anything evil; He is by nature just,
therefore He does not wish anything unjust; He is by nature true,
therefore He abominates falsehood; He is by nature immutable, therefore
He does not admit of change; and if He does not admit of change He is
always in the same state and condition. This He Himself asserts through
the prophet. “I am the Lord I change not.” <span
id="fr_1997"></span>[1998](#fn_1997.md) And the blessed David says “Thou
art the same and Thy years shall have no end.” <span
id="fr_1998"></span>[1999](#fn_1998.md) If He is the same He undergoes no
change. If He is naturally superior to change and mutation He has not
become from immortal, mortal nor from impassible, passible, for had this
been possible He would not have taken on Him our nature. But since He
has an immortal nature, He took a body capable of suffering, and with
the body a human soul. Both of these He kept unstained from the
defilements of sin, and gave His soul for the sake of the souls that had
sinned, and His body for the sake of the bodies that had died. And since
the body that was assumed is described as body of the very only begotten
Son of God, He refers the passion of the body to Himself. But the four
evangelists testify that it was not the divine nature but the body which
was nailed to the cross, all teaching with one voice that Joseph of
Arimathea came to Pilate and begged the body of Jesus; that he took down
the body of Jesus from the tree and wrapped in fine linen, and laid in
his own new tomb the body of Jesus; that Mary the Magdalene came to the
tomb seeking the body of Jesus and ran to His disciples, and reported
these things when she could not find the body of Jesus.

<span id="iv.x.cxlv-p10"></span>This is the unanimous teaching of the
evangelists. But if your opponents urge that the angels said “Come see
the place where the Lord lay” <span id="fr_1999"></span>[2000](#fn_1999.md)
let the foolish folk learn that the divine Scripture says also about the
victorious Stephen “And devout men carried Stephen to his burial.” <span
id="fr_2000"></span>[2001](#fn_2000.md) And yet it was the body only which
was deemed proper for burial, while the soul was not buried together
with the body; nevertheless the body alone was spoken of by the common
name. Similarly the blessed Jacob said to his sons “Bury me with my
fathers.” <span id="fr_2001"></span>[2002](#fn_2001.md) He did not say
“Bury my body.” Then he went on “There they buried Abraham and Sarah his
wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried
Leah.” <span id="fr_2002"></span>[2003](#fn_2002.md) He did not say “their
bodies.” The names are common to bodies or souls, but nevertheless it is
only the bodies which he called by the common names. In this manner too
we constantly describe the shrines of the holy apostles, prophets and
martyrs, one it may be of Dionysius, another of Julianus another of
Cosmas. <span id="fr_2003"></span>[2004](#fn_2003.md) And yet we know that
only fragmentary remains of bodies lie there, while the souls in diviner
regions are at rest. Precisely the same custom is to be found in common
use, for such an one, we say, died; and such an one lies in this place;
although we know that the soul is immortal and does not share the tomb
with the body. In this sense the angel said “Come see the place where
the Lord lay” <span id="fr_2004"></span>[2005](#fn_2004.md) not because he
shut the Godhead in the tomb, but because he spoke of the Lord’s body by
the Lord’s name.

<span id="iv.x.cxlv-p17"></span>In proof of this being the view of the
holy Fathers let them mark the words of Athanasius, illustrious
archbishop of Alexandria, who adorned his episcopate with confession. He
exclaims “Life cannot die, but rather quickens the dead.”

<span id="iv.x.cxlv-p18"></span>Let them hear too the words of the
far-<span id="page_312">p. 312</span> <span
id="iv.x.cxlv-Page_312"></span>famed Damasus bishop of Rome, “If anyone
allege that on the cross pain was undergone by the Godhead and not by
the body with the soul, the form of the servant which He had taken in
its completeness, let him be anathema.” <span
id="fr_2005"></span>[2006](#fn_2005.md)

<span id="iv.x.cxlv-p20"></span>Let them hear too the very sacred and
holy bishop of the Church of the Romans, the lord Leo, who has now
written “The Son of God suffered as He was capable of suffering, not
according to the nature which assumed but that which was assumed. For
the impassible nature assumed the passible body, and gave it for us, to
the end that He might work out our salvation and at the same time
preserve His own nature impassible.”

<span id="iv.x.cxlv-p21"></span>And again “For He did not come to
destroy His own nature but to save ours.” <span
id="fr_2006"></span>[2007](#fn_2006.md)

<span id="iv.x.cxlv-p23"></span>If therefore they accuse us for saying
that God can do what He wishes, but that He wishes what is becoming to
His own nature, and what is unbecoming He neither wishes nor is capable
of; let them accuse too these saints and all the rest who maintain this
position. Let them accuse even the Apostle who says “That by two
immutable things in which it was impossible for God to lie.” <span
id="fr_2007"></span>[2008](#fn_2007.md) And again “If we believe not, yet
He abideth faithful: He cannot deny Himself.” <span
id="fr_2008"></span>[2009](#fn_2008.md)

<span id="iv.x.cxlv-p26"></span>Repeat these passages to your opponents,
and if they are convinced, praise the good Lord for that, by means of
your zeal, He has benefited them. If they remain unconvinced, enter into
no discussion with them about doctrines, for it is forbidden by the
divine apostle to “strive about words to no profit but to the subverting
of the hearers.” <span id="fr_2009"></span>[2010](#fn_2009.md) But do you
keep inviolate the teaching of the Gospels, that in the day of His
appearing you may bring to the righteous Judge what has been entrusted
to you with its due interest, and may hear the longed for words “Well
done good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few
things I will make thee ruler over many things. Enter thou into the joy
of thy Lord.” <span id="fr_2010"></span>[2011](#fn_2010.md)

<span id="iv.x.cxlv-p2"></span> From the mention at the end of the
letter of the epistle of Leo to Flavianus, Garnerius argues that it must
be dated at the end of 449 or somewhat later. The epistle of Leo is
dated on the 13th of June and could not have reached Theodoret in his
detention at Cyrus till the autumn.
