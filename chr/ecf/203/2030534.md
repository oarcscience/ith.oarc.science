against the Manicheans, Sabellians and Arians and very particularly
against the Photinians who are now called Bonosiacians. This book he
entitled *On faith against heretics,* and in it he showed the Son to
have been coeternal with the Father and that He did not receive the
beginning of his deity from God the Father, at the time when conceived
by the act of God, he was born of the Virgin Mary his mother in true
humanity.
