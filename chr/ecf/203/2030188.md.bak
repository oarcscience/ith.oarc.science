<span id="iv.ix.v.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c57"><span
id="iv.ix.v.iii-p1.1"></span>Proof that the Divinity of the Saviour is
Impassible.</span>

<span id="iv.ix.v.iii-p2"></span>1. Alike by the divine Scripture and by
the holy Fathers assembled at Nicæa we have been taught to confess that
the Son is of one substance with God the Father. The impassibility of
the Father is also taught by the nature and proclaimed by the divine
Scripture. We shall then further confess the Son to be impassible, for
this definition is enforced by the identity of substance. Whenever then
we hear the divine Scripture proclaiming the cross and the death of the
Master Christ we attribute the passion to the flesh, for in no wise is
the Godhead, being by nature impassible, capable of suffering.

<span id="iv.ix.v.iii-p3"></span>2. “All things that the Father hath are
mine” <span id="fr_1596"></span>[1597](#fn_1596.md) says the Master Christ,
and one out of all is impassibility. If therefore as God He is
impassible, He suffered as man. For the divine nature does not undergo
suffering.

<span id="iv.ix.v.iii-p5"></span>3. The Lord said “the bread which I
will give is my flesh which I will give for the life of the
world,” <span id="fr_1597"></span>[1598](#fn_1597.md) and again “I am the
good shepherd and know my sheep and am known of mine…and I lay down my
life for the sheep.” <span id="fr_1598"></span>[1599](#fn_1598.md) So body
and soul are both given by the good shepherd for the sheep who have soul
and body.

<span id="iv.ix.v.iii-p8"></span>4. The nature of men is compounded of
body and soul. But it sinned and stood in need of a sacrifice free from
every spot. So the Creator took a body and a soul, and keeping them
clean from the stains of sin for men’s bodies gave His body and for
their souls His soul. If this is true, and true it is, for these are
words of truth itself, then wild and blasphemous are they who ascribe
passion to the divine nature.

<span id="iv.ix.v.iii-p9"></span>5. The blessed Paul called the Christ
“the first born of the dead;” <span id="fr_1599"></span>[1600](#fn_1599.md)
and I suppose the first born has the same nature as they of whom He is
called first born. As man then He is first born of the dead, for He
first destroyed the pangs of death and gave to all the sweet hope of
another life. As He rose so He suffered. As man then He suffered but as
awful God He remained impassible.

<span id="iv.ix.v.iii-p11"></span>6. The divine Apostle calls our
Saviour Christ “the firstfruits of them that slept,” <span
id="fr_1600"></span>[1601](#fn_1600.md) but the firstfruits are related to
the whole whereof they are firstfruits. He is not therefore called
firstfruits as God, for what relationship is there between Godhead and
manhood? The former is an immortal nature, the latter mortal. Such is
the nature of them that sleep, of whom Christ is called firstfruits. To
this nature belong death and resurrection, and in its resurrection we
have a proof of the general resurrection.

<span id="iv.ix.v.iii-p13"></span>7. When the Master Christ wished to
persuade the doubting Apostles that He had destroyed death and risen, He
shewed them parts of His body, His side, His hands, His feet and the
marks of the passion preserved therein. This body then rose, and this, I
ween, was shown to the disbelievers. What rose is what was buried, and
what was buried is what had died, and what had died is of course what
was nailed to the cross. So the divine nature united to the body
remained impassible.

<span id="iv.ix.v.iii-p14"></span>8. They who describe the flesh of the
Lord as giver of life make life itself mortal by their words. They ought
to have seen that it was giver of life through the life united to it.
But if according to their argument the life is mortal, how could the
flesh being itself by nature mortal, and made life-giving through the
life, remain life-giving?

<span id="iv.ix.v.iii-p15"></span>9. God the Word is by nature immortal,
and the flesh by nature mortal, but after the passion by union with the
Word the flesh itself became immortal. How then is it not absurd to say
that the giver of such immortality shared death?

<span id="iv.ix.v.iii-p16"></span><span id="page_249">p. 249</span>
<span id="iv.ix.v.iii-Page_249"></span>10. They who maintain that God
the Word suffered in the flesh should be asked the meaning of what they
say, and should they have the hardihood to reply that when the body was
pierced with nails the divine nature was sensible of pain, let them
learn that the divine nature did not fill the part of a soul. God the
Word had assumed a soul with the body. Should they reject this argument
as blasphemous, and should they assert that the flesh suffered by
nature, and that God the Word made the passion His own as of His own
flesh, let them not propound puzzling and murky phrases, but let them
clearly propound the meaning of the ill sounding phrase. They will have
all those who wish to follow the divine Scripture as their supporters in
this interpretation.

<span id="iv.ix.v.iii-p17"></span>11. The divine Peter in his Catholic
Epistle says that Christ suffered in the flesh. <span
id="fr_1601"></span>[1602](#fn_1601.md) But he who hears that Christ
suffered does not understand God the Word incorporeal, but incarnate.
The name of Christ indicates both natures; but the word “flesh”
connected with the passion signifies not that both, but that one of the
two, suffered. For he that hears that Christ suffered in the flesh
thinks of Him as impassible in that He was God, and attributes the
passion to the flesh alone. For just as when we hear him saying that God
had sworn to David of the fruit of his loins according to the flesh to
raise up the Christ, we do not say that God the Word derived His origin
from David, but that the flesh which God the Word took was akin to
David, so must he who hears that Christ suffered in the flesh, recognise
that the passion belongs to the flesh, and confess the impassibility of
the Godhead.

<span id="iv.ix.v.iii-p19"></span>12. When on the cross the Lord Christ
said, “Father into Thy hands I commend my spirit,” <span
id="fr_1602"></span>[1603](#fn_1602.md) this spirit is said by the Arians
and the Eunomians to be the Godhead of the only-begotten, for they hold
that the body which He took was without a soul, but the heralds of the
truth say that the soul was so called and they base their opinion on the
following passages. The right wise Evangelist immediately adds “And
having said thus He gave up the ghost.” <span
id="fr_1603"></span>[1604](#fn_1603.md) So says Luke, and the blessed Mark
similarly adds “He gave up the ghost.” <span
id="fr_1604"></span>[1605](#fn_1604.md) The divine Matthew writes, “yielded
up the Ghost,” <span id="fr_1605"></span>[1606](#fn_1605.md) and the divine
John, “gave up the Ghost.” <span id="fr_1606"></span>[1607](#fn_1606.md)
All speak according to the usage of men, for we are accustomed to use
all these expressions about those who die; none of them conveys any
meaning of Godhead, but they all signify the soul, and if any one were
to receive the Arian sense of the passage none the less even thus will
it shew the immortality of the divine nature. For Christ commended it to
the Father. He did not yield it to death. If then they that deny the
assumption of the soul, and maintain God the Word to be a creature, and
assert that He was in the body in place of a soul, deny that He was
delivered to death, how can they obtain pardon who while they confess
one substance of the Trinity, and leave the soul in its own immortality,
impudently dare to say that God the Word of one substance with the
Father tasted death?

<span id="iv.ix.v.iii-p25"></span>13. If Christ is both God and man, as
the divine Scripture teaches, and the illustrious Fathers persistently
preached, then He suffered as man, but as God remained impassible.

<span id="iv.ix.v.iii-p26"></span>14. If they acknowledge the assumption
of the flesh, and declare it to be passible before the resurrection, and
preach that the nature of the Godhead is impassible, why, leaving the
passible nature, do they attribute the passion to the impassible?

<span id="iv.ix.v.iii-p27"></span>15. If our Lord and Saviour nailed the
handwriting to the cross, as says the divine Apostle, <span
id="fr_1607"></span>[1608](#fn_1607.md) He then nailed the body, for on his
body every man like letters marks the prints of his sins, wherefore on
behalf of sinners He gave up the body that was free from all sin.

<span id="iv.ix.v.iii-p29"></span>16. When we say that the body or the
flesh or the manhood suffered, we do not separate the divine nature, for
as it was united to one hungering, thirsting, aweary, even asleep, and
undergoing the passion, itself affected by none of these but permitting
the human nature to be affected in its own way, so it was conjoined to
it even when crucified, and permitted the completion of the passion,
that by the passion it might destroy death; not indeed receiving pain
from the passion, but making the passion its own, as of its own temple,
and of the flesh united to it, on account of which flesh also the
faithful are called members of Christ, and He Himself is styled the head
of them that believed.
