id="vi.xi.ii.i-Page_435"></span><span class="c21"><span
id="vi.xi.ii.i-p1.1"></span>Book I.</span>

<span id="vi.xi.ii.i-p2"></span>The following is an epitome of the
argument:

<span id="vi.xi.ii.i-p3"></span>1. I must submit to the taunts of my
adversary as Christ did to those of the Jews.

<span id="vi.xi.ii.i-p4"></span>2. Yet the substantial charges must be
answered.

<span id="vi.xi.ii.i-p5"></span>3. I praised him but he has wounded me.

<span id="vi.xi.ii.i-p6"></span>4. I am no heretic, but declare my
faith, that of my baptism.

<span id="vi.xi.ii.i-p7"></span>5. I give a further proof of my faith in
the resurrection of the flesh.

<span id="vi.xi.ii.i-p8"></span>6–9. The resurrection body is a
spiritual body.

<span id="vi.xi.ii.i-p9"></span>10. Origen’s doctrines in the <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xi.ii.i-p9.1"></span>Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν</span>

<span id="vi.xi.ii.i-p10"></span>11. What led to the translation.

<span id="vi.xi.ii.i-p11"></span>12, 13. Pamphilus Apology for Origen.

<span id="vi.xi.ii.i-p12"></span>14. Preface to the Translation of the
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xi.ii.i-p12.1"></span>Περὶ
᾽Αρχῶν</span>

<span id="vi.xi.ii.i-p13"></span>15. Treatise on the Adulteration of the
works of Origen.

<span id="vi.xi.ii.i-p14"></span>16. The difficulties of translation.

<span id="vi.xi.ii.i-p15"></span>17. Explanation of Origen’s words “The
Son does not see the Father.”

<span id="vi.xi.ii.i-p16"></span>18. Difference between seeing and
knowing.

<span id="vi.xi.ii.i-p17"></span>19. The Translation interpolated by
Eusebius of Cremona.

<span id="vi.xi.ii.i-p18"></span>20. Eusebius, if acting honestly,
should have shown me what he thought dangerous.

<span id="vi.xi.ii.i-p19"></span>21. Jerome’s method of translation was
the same as mine.

<span id="vi.xi.ii.i-p20"></span>22. Jerome’s reference to his
Commentary on the Ephesians.

<span id="vi.xi.ii.i-p21"></span>23. Jerome has not really changed his
mind about Origen.

<span id="vi.xi.ii.i-p22"></span>24. Women turned into men and bodies
into souls.

<span id="vi.xi.ii.i-p23"></span>25. The foundation (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xi.ii.i-p23.1"></span>καταβολή</span>) of the
world explained by Jerome as a casting down.

<span id="vi.xi.ii.i-p24"></span>26. Jerome, under the name of
“another,” gives his own views.

<span id="vi.xi.ii.i-p25"></span>27. The fall of souls into human bodies
is taught by Jerome.

<span id="vi.xi.ii.i-p26"></span>28. Predestination.

<span id="vi.xi.ii.i-p27"></span>29. “Another,” who gives strange views,
is Jerome himself.

<span id="vi.xi.ii.i-p28"></span>30. “Hopers” and “fore-hopers.”

<span id="vi.xi.ii.i-p29"></span>31. and 30 (a). Jerome has confessed
these views to be his own.

<span id="vi.xi.ii.i-p30"></span>31 (a) and 32. Further identification
of Jerome’s views with Origen’s.

<span id="vi.xi.ii.i-p31"></span>33. The commentary on the Ephesians,
selected by Jerome, is his condemnation.

<span id="vi.xi.ii.i-p32"></span>34, 35. Principalities and Powers.

<span id="vi.xi.ii.i-p33"></span>36. Jerome’s complaint of new doctrines
may be retorted on himself.

<span id="vi.xi.ii.i-p34"></span>38, 39. Origin of men, angels, and
heavenly bodies.

<span id="vi.xi.ii.i-p35"></span>40, 41. The body as a prison.

angel, partaking in the final restoration.

<span id="vi.xi.ii.i-p37"></span>43. Arrogance of Jerome’s teaching.

<span id="vi.xi.ii.i-p38"></span>44. If Origen is not to be pardoned,
neither is Jerome.
