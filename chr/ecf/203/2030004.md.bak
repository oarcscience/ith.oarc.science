<span id="iv.ii-p3"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.ii-p3.1"></span>The</span> following translation has been made
from the edition published in Migne’s Patrologia. The plan originally
proposed was, in the case of the History, to make a revision of an
existing translation. This was, however, after a brief trial, abandoned,
and the translation has throughout been made entirely fresh. The
Letters, so far as the translator is aware, have never been published in
English before. The notes indicate with sufficient clearness to whom he
is indebted for such elucidation of the text as he may have been enabled
to furnish. Conscious of its imperfections, and not confident that
revision can have removed all blemishes and errors, he yet puts forth
this English version of the History, Dialogues, and Letters of
Theodoret, Bishop of Cyrus, in the hope that he may not have done great
injustice to their holy and learned author.
