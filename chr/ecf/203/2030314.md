<span id="iv.x.cxxv-p1"></span> *CXXIV. To the Learned Maranas.* <span
id="fr_1923"></span>[1924](#fn_1923.md)

<span id="iv.x.cxxv-p3"></span>I too am distressed at the calamities of
the Church, and wail over the storm that is raging; for myself I am glad
to be quit of agitation, and to be enjoying a calm which is delightful
to me. As to the men whom your learning states to be still carrying on
their iniquities, the day is not far distant when they will pay the
penalty of their present rash lawlessness. All things are governed by
the Lord of all with weight and rule, and whenever any fall away into
unbounded iniquity His long suffering comes to an end, and He then acts
as Judge and appoints punishment. Foreseeing this I pray that they may
cease from their license that I may not be compelled to weep once more
for them as I behold them undergoing chastisement.

<span id="iv.x.cxxv-p4"></span>Your excellency I can never forget, and I
beg our common Master to fill your house with blessing.

<span id="iv.x.cxxv-p2"></span> Cf. Letter LXVII. This letter may be
dated during Theodoret’s banishment to Nicerte in 449, and is evidently
in reply to a letter of condolence from the advocate.
