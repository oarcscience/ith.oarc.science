expedition of Valens against the Goths and how he paid the penalty of

<span id="iv.viii.iv.xxxii-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.iv.xxxii-p2.1"></span>Valens</span>, however, spurned these
excellent counsellors, and sent out his troops to join battle while he
himself sat waiting in a hamlet for the victory. His troops could not
stand against the barbarians’ charge, turned tail and were slain one
after another as they fled, the Romans fleeing at full speed and the
barbarians chasing them with all their might. When Valens heard of the
defeat he strove to conceal himself in the village where he lay, but
when the barbarians came up they set the place on fire and together with
it burnt the enemy of piety. <span id="page_131">p. 131</span> <span

paid the penalty of his errors. <span id="fr_806"></span>[807](#fn_806.md)

<span id="iv.viii.iv.xxxii-p3"></span> “On the 9th August, 378, a day
long and fatally memorable in the annals of the empire, the legions of
Valens moved forth from their entrenched camp under the walls of
Hadrianople, and after a march of eight miles under the hot sun of
August came in sight of the barbarian vanguard, behind which stretched
the circling line of the waggons that guarded the Gothic host. The
soldiers of the empire, hot, thirsty, wearied out with hours of waiting
under the blaze of an August sun, and only half understanding that the
negotiations were ended and the battle begun, fought at a terrible
disadvantage but fought not ill. The infantry on the left wing seem even
to have pushed back their enemies and penetrated to the Gothic waggons.
But they were for some reason not covered as usual by a force of cavalry
and they were jammed into a too narrow space of ground where they could
not use their spears with effect, yet presented a terribly easy mark to
the Gothic arrows. They fell in dense masses as they had stood. Then the
whole weight of the enemy’s attack was directed against the centre and
right. When the evening began to close in, the utterly routed Roman
soldiers were rushing in disorderly flight from the fatal field. The
night, dark and moonless, may have protected some, but more met their
death rushing blindly over a rugged and unknown country.

<span id="iv.viii.iv.xxxii-p4"></span>“Meanwhile Valens had sought
shelter with a little knot of soldiers (the two regiments of “Lancearii
and Mattiarii”), who still remained unmoved amidst the surging sea of
ruin. When their ranks too were broken, and when some of his bravest
officers had fallen around him, he joined the common soldiers in their
headlong flight. Struck by a Gothic arrow he fell to the ground, but was
carried off by some of the eunuchs and life-guardsmen who still
accompanied him, to a peasant’s cottage hard by. The Goths, ignorant of
his rank, but eager to strip the gaily-clothed guardsmen, surrounded the
cottage and attempted in vain to burst in the doors. Then mounting to
the roof they tried to smoke out the imprisoned inmates, but succeeding
beyond their desires, set fire to the cottage, and emperor, eunuchs, and
life-guardsmen perished in the flames. Only one of the body-guard
escaped, who climbed out through one of the blazing windows and fell
into the hands of the barbarians. He told them when it was too late what
a prize they had missed in their cruel eagerness, nothing less than the
emperor of Rome.

<span id="iv.viii.iv.xxxii-p5"></span>Ecclesiastical historians for
generations delighted to point the moral of the story of Valens, that he
who had seduced the whole Gothic nation into the heresy of Arius, and
thus caused them to suffer the punishment of everlasting fire, was
himself by those very Goths burned alive on the terrible 9th of August.
