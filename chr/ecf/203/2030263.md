<span id="iv.x.lxxiv-p1"></span> *LXXIV. To Urbanus.*

<span id="iv.x.lxxiv-p2"></span>It has been granted to us by our
generous Lord once again to enjoy the feast and to send to your
excellency the festal salutation. We pray that you may be well and
prosperous, and share the ineffable and divine boon which to them that
approach supplies the seeds of the blessings hoped for, and gives the
symbols of the life and kingdom that have no end. These things we
beseech the loving Lord to impart to you, for it is natural for friends
to ask that their friends may be blessed.
