<span id="iv.x.lxiii-p1"></span> *LXIII. Festal.* <span
id="fr_1707"></span>[1708](#fn_1707.md)

<span id="iv.x.lxiii-p3"></span>We have enjoyed the wonted blessings of
the Feast. We have kept the memorial Feast of the Passion of Salvation;
by means of the resurrection of the Lord we have received the glad
tidings of the resurrection of all, and have hymned the ineffable loving
kindness of our God and Saviour. But the storm tossing the churches has
not suffered us to take our share of unalloyed gladness. If, when one
member is in pain the whole body is partaker of the pang, <span
id="fr_1708"></span>[1709](#fn_1708.md) how can we forbear from lamentation
when all the body is distressed? And it intensifies our dis<span
id="page_269">p. 269</span> <span
id="iv.x.lxiii-Page_269"></span>couragement to think that these things
are the prelude of the general apostasy. May your piety pray that since
we are in this plight we may get the divine succour, that, as the divine
Apostle phrases it, we may “be able to withstand the evil day.” <span
id="fr_1709"></span>[1710](#fn_1709.md) But if any time remain for this
life’s business, pray that the tempest may pass away, and the churches
recover their former calm, that the enemies of the truth may no more
exult at our misfortunes.
