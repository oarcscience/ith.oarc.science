<span id="vi.xii.iii.v"></span>

<span id="vi.xii.iii.v-p1"></span> 4. Your letter goes on:

<span id="vi.xii.iii.v-p2"></span>“Pray do not trouble yourself to give
a large sum of gold to bribe my secretary, as your friends did in the
case of my papers containing the <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xii.iii.v-p2.1"></span>Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν</span>, before they had been
corrected and brought to completion, so that they might more easily
falsify documents which no one possessed, or at least very few. Accept
the document which I send you gratis, though you would be glad to pay a
large sum to buy it.”

<span id="vi.xii.iii.v-p3"></span>I should have thought you would be
ashamed of such a beginning of your work. What! I bribe your Secretary!
Is there any one who would attempt to vie with the wealth of
Crœsus <span id="fr_3158"></span>[3159](#fn_3158) and Darius? <span
id="fr_3159"></span>[3160](#fn_3159) who is there that does not tremble
when he is suddenly confronted with a Demaratus <span
id="fr_3160"></span>[3161](#fn_3160) or a Crassus? <span
id="fr_3161"></span>[3162](#fn_3161) Have you become so brazen-faced,
that you put your trust in lies and think lies will protect you and that
we shall believe every fiction which you choose to frame? Who then was
<span id="page_521">p. 521</span> <span
id="vi.xii.iii.v-Page_521"></span>it who stole that letter in which you
were so highly praised, from the cell of our brother Eusebius? Whose
artfulness was it, and whose accomplices, through which a certain
document was found in the lodgings of that Christian woman Fabiola and
of that wise man Oceanus, which they themselves had never seen? Do you
think that you are innocent because you can cast upon others all the
imputations which properly belong to you? Is every one who offends you,
however guiltless and harmless he may be, at once held to become a
criminal? You think so, I suppose, because you are possessed of that
through which the chastity of Danaë <span
id="fr_3162"></span>[3163](#fn_3162) was broken down, that which had
more power with Gihazi than his master’s sacred character, that for
which Judas betrayed his Master. <span
id="fr_3163"></span>[3164](#fn_3163)
