<span id="iv.x.c-p3"></span>I have recently received your excellency’s
letter. For the zeal you have shewn on my behalf I thank you, and pray
the God of all to guard the goods you have, to increase them with
further boons, and to grant you the enjoyment of future and everlasting
blessings. I think that He hears the prayer even of them that are
sentenced to relegation, and all the more when it is for the sake of His
divine doctrine that they are undergoing apparent disgrace. I am writing
by the very religious bishops, and I beg that they may meet with your
kindly care. It is for the sake of the faith of the gospel and the peace
of the churches that they have undertaken this long journey.
