<span id="iv.x.cxv-p3"></span>The reverend presbyter Peter is
distinguished not only by his priestly rank, but also by his wise
practice in medicine. During his long residence with us he has won all
hearts by his conciliatory manners. On learning of my departure he has
now determined to leave Cyrus; I therefore commend him to your
excellency, and hope that, fully capable as he is of doing good service
to the city,—for when he lived at Alexandria he practised the same
profession,—he will meet with kindness at your hands.

<span id="iv.x.cxv-p2"></span> Written after the deposition at Ephesus,
and when Theodoret is either on the point of departing, or has departed,
from Cyrus to the Apamean monastery. The simultaneous exercise of the
clerical and medical professions points perhaps to the continuance of
the class of “Silverless martyrs,” i.e. physicians who took no fee but
healed on condition that their patients should turn to Christ. The
legendary Saints of the unfeed faculty are Cosmo and Damian, the
brothers whose church occupies the site of the Temple of Remus, or of
the Penates, in the Roman Forum.
