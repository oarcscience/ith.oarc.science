<span id="iv.viii.iii.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.iii.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI</span>.—*Of Apollo and
Daphne, and of the holy Babylas*.

<span id="iv.viii.iii.vi-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.iii.vi-p2.1"></span>Julian</span>, wishing to make a
campaign against the Persians, dispatched the trustiest of his officers
to all the oracles throughout the Roman Empire, while he himself went as
a suppliant to implore the Pythian oracle of Daphne to make known to him
the future. The oracle responded that the corpses lying hard by were
becoming an obstacle to divination; that they must first be removed to
another spot; and that then he would utter his prophecy, for, said he,
“I could say nothing, if the grove be not purified.” Now at that time
there were lying there the relics of the victorious martyr Babylas <span
id="fr_620"></span>[621](#fn_620.md) and the lads who had gloriously
suffered with him, and the lying prophet was plainly stopped from
uttering his wonted lies by the holy influence of Babylas. Julian was
aware of this, for his ancient piety had taught him the power of
victorious martyrs, and so he removed no other body from the spot, but
only ordered the worshippers of Christ to translate the relics of the
victorious martyrs. They marched with joy to the grove, <span
id="fr_621"></span>[622](#fn_621.md) put the coffin on a car and went
before it leading a vast concourse of people, singing the psalms of
David, while at every pause they shouted “Shame be to all them that
worship molten images.” <span id="fr_622"></span>[623](#fn_622.md) For they
understood the translation of the martyr to mean defeat for the demon.

<span id="iv.viii.iii.vi-p3"></span> Babylas, bishop of Antioch from 238
to 251, was martyred in the Decian persecution either by death in prison
(Euseb. H. E. vi. 39 <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.viii.iii.vi-p3.1"></span>μετὰ τὴν ὁμολογίαν ἐν δεσμωτηρί& 251·
μεταλλάξαντος</span>) or by violence. (Chrys. de s. B. c. gentes)
“Babylas had won for himself a name by his heroic courage as bishop of
Antioch. It was related of him that on one occasion when the emperor
Philip, who was a Christian, had presented himself one Easter Eve at the
time of prayer, he had boldly refused admission to the sovereign, till
he had gone through the proper discipline of a penitent for some offence
committed. (Eus. H. E. vi. 34.) He acted like a good shepherd, says
Chrysostom, who drives away the scabby sheep, lest it should infect the
flock.” Bp. Lightfoot, Ap. Fathers II. i. p. 40–46.

five miles distant from the city.” “Rufinus says six, but this appears
to be an exaggeration.” Bp. Lightfoot l. c.
