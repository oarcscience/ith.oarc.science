<span id="iv.x.cliii-p1"></span> <span id="page_333">p. 333</span> <span
id="iv.x.cliii-Page_333"></span>*CLII. Report of the (Bishops) of the
East to the Emperor, giving information of their proceedings, and
explaining the cause of the delay in the arrival of the Bishop of
Antioch.* <span id="fr_2254"></span>[2255](#fn_2254.md)

<span id="iv.x.cliii-p3"></span>In obedience to the order of your pious
letter we have journeyed to the Ephesian metropolis. There we have found
the affairs of the Church in confusion, and disturbed by internecine
war. The cause of this is that Cyril of Alexandria and Memnon of Ephesus
have banded together and mustered a great mob of rustics, and have
forbidden both the celebration of the great feast of Pentecost, and the
evening and morning offices. <span id="fr_2255"></span>[2256](#fn_2255.md)

<span id="iv.x.cliii-p5"></span>They have shut the sacred churches and
martyrs’ shrines; they have assembled apart with the victims of their
deceit; they have wrought innumerable iniquities, trampling under foot
alike the canons of the holy Fathers, and your own decrees. And the
action has been taken in face of the order given both in writing and by
word of mouth by the most excellent count Candidianus, <span
id="fr_2256"></span>[2257](#fn_2256.md) envoy of your Christ-loving
majesty, that the council must await the arrival of the very holy
bishops, coming from all quarters of the Empire, and then and not till
then formally assemble in obedience to your piety’s commands. Moreover
Cyril of Alexandria had written to me, the bishop of Antioch, two days
before the meeting of their synod, that the whole council was awaiting
my arrival. We have therefore deposed both the aforenamed, Cyril and
Memnon, and have excluded them from all the services of the church. The
rest, who have participated in their iniquity, we have excommunicated,
until they shall reject and anathematize the Chapters <span
id="fr_2257"></span>[2258](#fn_2257.md) issued by Cyril, which are full of
the Eunomian and Arian heresies, and shall, in obedience to your piety’s
command, assemble together with us, and shall in an orderly manner and
with all exactitude, together with ourselves, examine into the questions
at issue, and confirm the pious doctrine of the holy Fathers.

<span id="iv.x.cliii-p8"></span>As to the delay in my own arrival be it
known to your piety that, in consideration of the distance of the way by
land,—and this was our route,—I have come very quickly, I have travelled
forty stages without pausing to rest on the way; so your Christian
majesty may learn from the inhabitants of the towns on the route.
Besides this I was detained many days in Antioch by the famine there; by
the daily tumults of the people; and by the unusual severity of the
rainy season, which caused the torrents to swell, and threatened danger
to the town.

<span id="iv.x.cliii-p2"></span> Cyril’s party met on June 22,
431,—numbering 198, in the Church of the Virgin. John of Antioch with
his fourteen supporters did not arrive till the 27th. Unable to start
from their diocese before April 26, the octave of Easter, they did not
assemble at Antioch till May 10, and then were delayed by a famine.
Immediately on their arrival the “Conciliabulum” of the 43
anti-Cyrillians met with indecent precipitancy.

<span id="iv.x.cliii-p4"></span> Both parties, regarding their opponents
as excommunicate, forbade them to perform their sacred functions.

<span id="iv.x.cliii-p6"></span> *“Comes domesticorum”* commander of the
guards, was representative of Theodosius II. and Valentinian III. at
Ephesus. Candidianus was at first disposed to demur to the condemnation
of Nestorius as disorderly and irregular, and to side with the
Orientals.
