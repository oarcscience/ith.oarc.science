<span id="iv.x.li-p1"></span> *LI. To the Presbyter Agapius.* <span

<span id="iv.x.li-p3"></span>The works of virtue are admirable in
themselves, but yet more admirable do they appear if they find an
eloquence able to report them well. Neither of these advantages has been
lacking in the case of the bishop beloved of God, the lord Thomas, for
he himself has contributed his own labours on behalf of piety, and has
found in your holiness a tongue to bestow meet praise on those labours.
Coming as he did with such testimony in his favour we have been all the
more delighted to see him, and, after enjoying his society for a short
space, have dismissed him to his charge.
