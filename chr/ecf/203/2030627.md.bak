id="vi.iii-p3.1"></span>Preface to the Commentary on the Benedictions of
the Twelve Patriarchs.</span>

<span id="vi.iii-p4"></span>———————

<span id="vi.iii-p5"></span>Rufinus had arrived with Melania, in Italy,
in the spring of 397, after a stay in the East of some 25 years. They
had visited Paulinus at Nola, and had been entertained by him with the
highest honours. Melania probably remained in Campania, where she had
property, engaged in family affairs; but Rufinus set out for Rome. He
stopped, however, for some months at the monastery of Pinetum near
Terracina, with his friend Urseius the Abbot.

<span id="vi.iii-p6"></span>His work on Jacob’s Benedictions on his sons
in Gen. xlix was occasioned by the following letter from Paulinus, who
alludes to it in writing to Sulpicius Severus (Ep. xxviii). “I have
written a short note to the Presbyter Rufinus, the companion of the
saintly Melania in her spiritual journey, a truly holy and truly learned
man, and one united with me on this account in the closest affection.”
The work itself, being an Exposition of Scripture, is not given, but
only the Preface.

<span id="vi.iii-p7"></span>*Paulinus to his brother Rufinus, all best
wishes.* <span id="fr_2771"></span>[2772](#fn_2771.md)

<span id="vi.iii-p9"></span>1. Even a short letter from one so
likeminded as yourself is a great refreshment, like the dew which
revives a thirsty field when the rivers are low. But while I confess
that I have been refreshed by this letter which, though short, is still
from you, and is sent by the servant of our common children, yet I have
been troubled at hearing that all at once through the disquiet of your
anxiety and the uncertainty caused by delay, you have determined that
you must go to Rome. May the Lord grant you to receive joy in the Lord
from what we are doing: so that, as now we share in your anxiety, so we
may rejoice in your joy, and that we may still have some beginnings of
hope that we may enjoy your presence, when you begin to see clearly your
way and the will of the Lord concerning you.

<span id="vi.iii-p10"></span>2. You are kind enough, with that affection
which makes you love me as yourself, to desire that I should take up
more seriously the study of Greek literature. I acknowledge the kindness
which dictates this wish; but I am unable to give it effect, unless,
through God’s blessing on my earnest desires, I should have the
happiness of your company for a longer time. How can I gain any
proficiency in a foreign tongue in the absence of him who might teach me
what I do not know? I think that, in the matter of the translation of
St. Clement, <span id="fr_2772"></span>[2773](#fn_2772.md) besides the
other defects of my abilities, you noticed this especially as showing
the weakness caused by my want of practice, that where I had been unable
to understand the words or to express them accurately, I have translated
them according to my idea of their drift, or, to speak more truly, set
down what I thought ought to be there. All the more therefore do I need
that, through God’s mercy, I may have your company in fuller measure;
for that will be like wealth to the poor or like gathering the crumbs
which fall from the rich man’s table with the eager appetite of the
bondman’s heart.

<span id="vi.iii-p12"></span>3. At the moment when I was writing these
words my eye fell upon a passage of Scripture, occurring in a portion
which I had set down for reading, namely that in which Judah is blessed
by Jacob; and I determined after a time to knock at the door of your
mind, for which the Lord had given me this most timely occasion. I beg
you, if you love me, or rather because you love me so greatly, to write
and say how you understand this blessing of the Patriarchs; and, if
there are some things in it which are worth knowing but hard to
understand, impart to me also the knowledge of them; especially of that
passage which says: “Binding his <span id="page_418">p. 418</span> <span
id="vi.iii-Page_418"></span>colt to the vine and his ass’s <span
id="fr_2773"></span>[2774](#fn_2773.md) colt to the haircloth.” <span
id="fr_2774"></span>[2775](#fn_2774.md) Tell me what is the colt and the
ass’s colt, and why his colt is to be bound to the vine, but the ass’s
colt to the hair cloth.

<span id="vi.iii-p15"></span>The answer of Rufinus forms the Preface to
his Exposition of the Benedictions.

<span id="vi.iii-p16"></span>1. The more I excuse myself to you, and the
more I assert that I am unable to respond to your inquiries, the more
instant you become in your requests, and the harder become your demands:
you treat me as you would an ox whose laziness you have discovered, and
prick his flanks and back as he stops and turns back with goads of ever
increasing sharpness. I must point out to you, therefore, that, even if
I am able to bow my neck low so as just to drag the heavy yoke which you
lay upon me, yet I have no chance of bursting at a rapid pace into the
open and wide-spreading plains through a form of speech which flows at
large and pours itself forth over far-extending space. Bear with me
therefore if my resolution has been but tardily fulfilled, and if I come
up only at a feeble pace to the point to which you call me.

<span id="vi.iii-p17"></span>2. You ask me how the passage in Genesis is
to be understood in which Israel the father of the patriarchs is
represented as predicting what he saw would happen to each of his sons,
and says of Judah, amongst other things: “Binding his colt to the vine,
and his ass’s colt to the tendril of the vine.” You write it “and his
ass’s colt to the haircloth” (cilicium); but in the Greek it stands:
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.iii-p17.1"></span>καὶ τῇ ἕλικι τὸν
πῶλον τῆς ὄνου αὐτοῦ</span>. The Greeks call by the name <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.iii-p17.2"></span>ἕ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.iii-p17.3"></span>λικα</span>(twist) not the
sprigs of the vine (as our copies have it) but those sickle-like
shoots <span id="fr_2775"></span>[2776](#fn_2775.md) by which it supports
itself on branches of trees or poles or the supports of the kind which I
think the farmers call goatikins; <span
id="fr_2776"></span>[2777](#fn_2776.md) so that the vine is made safe by
these clinging shoots from all danger of falling, and the tendril can
either become loaded with grapes or grow out in unfettered length. I
think therefore that this very word (helici), like some others, must
have been set down a long time ago in the Latin versions, and that it
was afterwards supposed by unintelligent copyists that by helici,
hair-cloth (cilicium) must be meant.

<span id="vi.iii-p20"></span>3. It is easy in this way to emend the
mistakes of the translation; but it is not so easy to find out the
meaning of the expression itself unless we take into consideration the
whole passage. But the treatment of this passage would be placed in a
fuller and clearer light if we could go back to the beginning of the
whole of these Benedictions. But this implies no small amount of leisure
and of time; or, to speak in a more Christian sense, it demands a mind
illuminated by the Holy Spirit. My talent is but slight, and there are
many demands on my time; and my friends are urging me to comply with
their requests about Origen. <span id="fr_2777"></span>[2778](#fn_2777.md)
But, so far as these circumstances admit, and so great a matter can be
treated with brevity, I will state at once what appears to me the true
meaning of this passage, for the love with which you bid me trust you in
everything, and without prejudice to the judgment of others, who may
have something better to say about it.

<span id="vi.iii-p14"></span> This is a mistaken reading (though said by
Vallarsi to be accepted by both Ambrose and Augustin), Cilicium for
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.iii-p14.1"></span>ἕ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.iii-p14.2"></span>λικι</span>. Rufinus adopts
the latter. “Binding his ass’s colt to the tendril of the vine.”

<span id="fn_2775"></span>[418:2776](2030627.htm#fr_2775.md) <span
id="vi.iii-p17.4"></span>

<span id="vi.iii-p18"></span> The word in the text *rucinnulos* is
unknown in Latin. The most likely conjecture as to the right reading is
*ruscarias quibus* (that is *ruscarias falculas*—sickles for weeding out
butcher’s broom, as mentioned by Cato and Varro).

<span id="fn_2776"></span>[418:2777](2030627.htm#fr_2776.md) <span

<span id="vi.iii-p19"></span> Capreolos. Properly little goats, thus
used for the props, the fork of which resembled the horns of the goat.
The word is also used for the tendrils of the vine, and is by some
derived from *capio.*
