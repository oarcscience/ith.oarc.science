<span id="iv.x.cvii-p1"></span> *CVII. To the Presbyter Theodotus.*

<span id="iv.x.cvii-p2"></span>The struggles which your piety has
undergone on behalf of the apostolic doctrines are not unknown, but are
frequently mentioned alike by those who have known them by experience,
and by others who have heard of them from these. Continue, my dear sir,
your efforts, and fight for the doctrines of the Fathers. For these I
too am <span id="page_289">p. 289</span> <span
id="iv.x.cvii-Page_289"></span>buffeted in all directions and, while I
receive the shock of the great waves, I beseech our Governor either to
nod his head and scatter the tempest, or enable the victims of the storm
by His grace to play the man.
