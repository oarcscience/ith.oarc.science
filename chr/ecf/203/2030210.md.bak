<span id="iv.x.xxi"></span>

<span id="iv.x.xxi-p1"></span> *XXI. To the Learned Eusebius.*

<span id="iv.x.xxi-p2"></span>The disseminators of this great news, with
the idea that it would be very distasteful to me, fancied that they
might in this way annoy me. But I by God’s grace welcomed the news, and
await the event with pleasure. Indeed very grateful to me is any kind of
trouble which is brought on me for the sake of the divine doctrines.
For, if we really trust in the Lord’s promises, “The sufferings of this
present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be
revealed in us.” <span id="fr_1648"></span>[1649](#fn_1648.md)

<span id="iv.x.xxi-p4"></span>And why do I speak of the enjoyment of the
good things which are hoped for? For even if no prize had been offered
to them that struggle for the sake of true religion, Truth alone by her
own unaided force would herself have been sufficient to persuade them
that love her to welcome gladly all perils in her cause. And the divine
Apostle is witness of what I say, exclaiming as he does, “Who shall
separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or
persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril or sword? As it is
written, ‘For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted
as sheep for the slaughter.’” <span id="fr_1649"></span>[1650](#fn_1649.md)

<span id="iv.x.xxi-p6"></span>And then to teach us that he looks for no
reward, but only loves his Saviour, he adds straightway “Nay in all
these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved
us.” <span id="fr_1650"></span>[1651](#fn_1650.md)

<span id="iv.x.xxi-p8"></span>And he goes on further to exhibit his own
love more clearly. “For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life,
nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor
things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be
able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our
Lord.” <span id="fr_1651"></span>[1652](#fn_1651.md)

<span id="iv.x.xxi-p10"></span>Behold, my friend, the flame of apostolic
affection; see the torch of love. <span
id="fr_1652"></span>[1653](#fn_1652.md)

<span id="iv.x.xxi-p12"></span>I covet not, he says, what is His. I only
long for Him; and this love of mine is an unquenchable love and I would
gladly forego all present and future felicity, aye, suffer and endure
again all kinds of pain so as to keep with me this flame in all its
force. This was exemplified by the divine writer in deed <span
id="page_258">p. 258</span> <span id="iv.x.xxi-Page_258"></span>as well
as in word and everywhere by land and sea he has left behind him
memorials of his sufferings. So when I turn my eyes on him and on the
rest of the patriarchs, prophets, apostles, martyrs, priests, what is
commonly reckoned miserable I cannot but hold to be delightful. I
confess to a feeling of shame when I remember how even they who never
learnt the lessons we have learnt, but followed no other guide but human
nature alone, have won conspicuous places in the race of virtue. The
famous Socrates, son of Sophroniscus, when under the calumnious
indictment, not only treated the lies of his accusers with contempt, but
expressed his cheerfulness in the midst of his troubles in the words,
“Anytus and Meletus <span id="fr_1653"></span>[1654](#fn_1653.md) can kill
me, but they cannot harm me.” And the orator of Pæania, <span
id="fr_1654"></span>[1655](#fn_1654.md) who was as wise as he was eloquent,
enriched both the men of his own day and them that should come after him
with the saying: “to all the race of men the end of life is death, even
though one shut himself up for safety in a cell; so good men are bound
ever to put their hand to every honourable work, ever defending
themselves with good hope as with a shield, and bravely to bear whatever
lot may be given them by God.” <span
id="fr_1655"></span>[1656](#fn_1655.md)

<span id="iv.x.xxi-p22"></span>Moreover a writer of earlier date than
Demosthenes, I mean the son of Olorus, wrote many noble sentiments, and
among them this “We must bear what the gods send us of necessity and the
fortune of war with courage.” <span id="fr_1656"></span>[1657](#fn_1656.md)
Why need I quote philosophers, historians, and orators? For even the men
who gave higher honour to their mythology than to the truth have
inserted many useful exhortations in their stories; as Homer in his
poems introduces the wisest of the Hellenes preparing himself for deeds
of valour, where he says

<span id="iv.x.xxi-p25"></span>“He chid his angry spirit and beat his
breast,

<span id="iv.x.xxi-p26"></span>And said ‘Forbear my mind, and think on
this:

<span id="iv.x.xxi-p27"></span>There hath been time when bitterer
agonies

<span id="iv.x.xxi-p28"></span>Have tried thy patience.’” <span
id="fr_1657"></span>[1658](#fn_1657.md)

<span id="iv.x.xxi-p30"></span>Similar passages might easily be
collected from poets, orators, and philosophers, but for us the divine
writings are sufficient.

<span id="iv.x.xxi-p31"></span>I have quoted what I have to prove how
disgraceful it were for the mere disciples of nature to get the better
of us who have had the teaching of the prophets and the apostles,
trusting in the Saviour’s sufferings and looking for the resurrection of
the body, freedom from corruption, the gift of immortality and the
kingdom of heaven.

<span id="iv.x.xxi-p32"></span>So, my dear friend, comfort those who are
discouraged at the stories bruited abroad, and if anybody is pleased at
them, tell them that we are happy too, that we are exulting and dancing
with joy, and that what they call punishment we are looking for as the
kingdom of heaven itself.

<span id="iv.x.xxi-p33"></span>To inform those who do not know in what
mind we are, be assured, most excellent friend, that we believe, as we
have been taught, in the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. There is
no truth in the slander of some that we have been taught to believe, or
have been baptized, or do believe, or teach others to believe, in two
Sons. As we know one Father and one Holy Ghost so we know one Son, our
Lord Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God, God the Word who was
made man. We do not however deny the properties of the natures. We hold
them to be in error who divide the one Lord Jesus Christ into two Sons,
and we also call them enemies of the truth who endeavour to confound the
natures. We believe an union to have been made without confusion, and we
reckon some qualities to be proper to the manhood and others to the
Godhead; for just as the man—I mean man in general—reasonable and mortal
being, has a soul and has a body, and is reckoned to be one being, just
so the distinction between the two natures does not divide the one man
into two persons, but we recognise in the one man both the immortality
of the soul and the mortality of the body, and acknowledge the invisible
soul and the visible body, but, as I said, one being at once reasonable
and mortal; so do we recognise our Lord and God, I mean the Son of God
our Lord Christ, even after His incarnation, to be one Son; for the
union is indivisible, as we know it is without confusion. We acknowledge
too that the Godhead is without beginning, and that the manhood is of
recent origin; for the one nature is of the seed of Abraham and David,
from whom descended the holy Virgin, but the divine nature was begotten
of the God and Father before the ages without time, without passions,
without severance. But suppose the distinction between flesh <span
id="page_259">p. 259</span> <span id="iv.x.xxi-Page_259"></span>and
Godhead to be destroyed, what weapons shall we use in our war with Arius
and Eunomius? How shall we undo their blasphemy against the only
begotten? As it is, we apply the words of humiliation as to man, the
words of exaltation and divinity as to God, and the setting forth of the
truth is very easy to us.

<span id="iv.x.xxi-p34"></span>But this disquisition on the faith is
exceeding the limits of a letter. Still even these few words are enough
to show the character of the apostolic faith. <span
