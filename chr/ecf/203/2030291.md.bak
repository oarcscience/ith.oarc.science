<span id="iv.x.cii-p1"></span> *CII. To Bishop Basilius.* <span
id="fr_1820"></span>[1821](#fn_1820.md)

<span id="iv.x.cii-p3"></span>There is nothing remarkable in the
reproaches that are directed against me being heard in silence by men
who do not know me; but that your holiness should not refute the lies of
my revilers, or at least should do so only to a certain extent, and with
no great heartiness, passes the belief of any one who knows your
character and conduct. And I say this not because friendship ought to be
preferred to truth, but because the witness of truth is on the side of
friendship. Your reverence has very often heard me preaching in church,
and, in other assemblies where I have spoken on doctrinal questions; you
have listened to what I have said, and I do not know of any occasion on
which you have found fault with me for expressing unorthodox opinions.
But what is the case at the present moment? Why in the world, my dear
friend, do you not utter a word against falsehood, while you allow a
friend to be calumniated and the truth to be assailed? If this is
because you disregard the helpless and insignificant, remember the plain
proclamation of the commandment of the Lord “Take heed that ye despise
not one of these little ones which believe in me, for I say unto you
that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which
is in heaven.” <span id="fr_1821"></span>[1822](#fn_1821.md) If however it
is the influence of my calumniators which imposes silence upon you, you
must listen to the other law which says “Thou shalt not honour the
person of the mighty” <span id="fr_1822"></span>[1823](#fn_1822.md) and
“Judge righteous judgment” <span id="fr_1823"></span>[1824](#fn_1823.md)
and “Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil” <span
id="fr_1824"></span>[1825](#fn_1824.md) and “He that shutteth his eyes from
seeing evil and stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood.” <span
id="fr_1825"></span>[1826](#fn_1825.md) You may find innumerable similar
passages in holy Scripture, which I have thought it needless to collect
when writing to a man brought up in the divine oracles, and watering
Christian people with his teaching. But this I will say, that we shall
all stand before the judgment seat of Christ, and shall give account of
our words and deeds. I, who for every other reason dread this tribunal,
now that I am encompassed with calumny, find my chief consolation in the
thought of it.

<span id="iv.x.cii-p2"></span> Cf. Letter LXXXV. There seems nothing to
indicate whether this Basil is Basil of Seleucia or Basil of
Trajanopolis, both of whom were present at the Latrocinium and took part
against Theodoret. Garnerius refers it to the former, a time-server of
the court.
