<span id="iv.viii.iii.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.iii.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII</span>.—*Of Valentinianus
the great Emperor*.

<span id="iv.viii.iii.xii-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.iii.xii-p2.1"></span>Valentinianus, <span
id="fr_636"></span>[637](#fn_636.md) </span> who shortly afterwards became
emperor, was at that time a Tribune and commanded the Hastati quartered
in the palace. He made no secret of his zeal for the true religion. On
one occasion when the infatuated emperor was going in solemn procession
into the sacred enclosure of the Temple of Fortune, on either side of
the gates stood the temple servants purifying, as they supposed, all who
were coming in, with their sprinkling whisks. As Valentinianus walked
before the emperor, he noticed that a drop had fallen on his own cloak
and gave the attendant a blow with his fist, “for,” said he, “I am not
purified but defiled.” For this deed he won two empires. On seeing what
had happened Julian the accursed sent him to a fortress in the desert,
and ordered him there to remain, but after the lapse of a year and a few
months he received the empire as a reward of his confession of the
faith, for not only in the life that is to come does the just Judge
honour them that care for holy things, but sometimes even here below He
bestows recompense for good deeds, confirming the hope of guerdons yet
to be received by what he gives in abundance now.

<span id="iv.viii.iii.xii-p4"></span>But the tyrant devised another
contrivance against the truth, for when according to ancient custom he
had taken his seat upon the imperial throne to distribute gold among the
ranks of his soldiery, contrary to custom he had an altar full of hot
coals introduced, and incense put upon a table, and ordered each man who
was to receive the <span id="page_102">p. 102</span> <span
id="iv.viii.iii.xii-Page_102"></span>gold first to throw incense on the
altar, and then to take the gold from his own right hand. The majority
were wholly unaware of the trap thus laid; but those who were forewarned
feigned illness and so escaped this cruel snare. Others in their
eagerness for the money made light of their salvation while another
group abandoned their faith through cowardice.

id="iv.viii.iii.xii-p2.2"></span>

<span id="iv.viii.iii.xii-p3"></span> Valentinianus, a native of Cibalis
(on the Save) in Pannonia (Bosnia) was elected Feb. 26, 364, and reigned
till Nov. 17, 375. Though a Christian, he was tolerant of paganism, or
the peasant’s religion, as in his reign heathenism began to be named
(Codex Theod. xvi. ii. 18). The “shortly after” of the text means some
two years.
