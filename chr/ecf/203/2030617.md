Africa and public confessor, commanded by Huneric <span

exposition of the catholic faith and especially to discuss the meaning
of the word Homoousian, with the consent of all the bishops and
confessors of Mauritania in Africa and Sardinia and Corsica, who had
remained in the catholic faith, composed a book of faith, fortified not
only by quotations from the Holy Scriptures but by testimonies of the
Fathers, and sent it by his companions in confession. But now, exiled as
a reward for his faithful tongue, like an anxious shep<span

over his sheep he has left behind works urging them to remember the
faith and the one sacred baptism to be preserved at all hazards. He also
wrote out the *Discussions* which he held through messengers with the
leaders of the Arians and sent them to be given to Huneric by his major
domo. Likewise also he presented to the same, petitions for the peace of
the Christians which were of the nature of an *Apology,* and he is said
to be still living for the strengthening of the church.
