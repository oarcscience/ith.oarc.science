<span id="vi.xi.iii.vi"></span>

<span id="vi.xi.iii.vi-p1"></span> 5. When he was living at Rome he
wrote <span id="fr_2935"></span>[2936](#fn_2935.md) a treatise on the
preservation of virginity, which all the pagans and enemies of God, all
apostates and persecutors, and whoever else hate the Christian name,
vied with one another in copying out, because of the infamous charges
and foul reproaches which it contained against all orders and degrees
among us, against all who profess and call themselves Christians, in a
word, against the universal church; and also because this man declared
that the crimes imputed to us by the Gentiles, which were before
supposed to be false were really true, and indeed that much worse things
were done by our people than those laid to their charge. First, he
defames the virgins themselves of whose virtue he professed to be
writing, speaking of them in these words: <span
id="fr_2936"></span>[2937](#fn_2936.md)

<span id="vi.xi.iii.vi-p4"></span>“Some of them change their dress and
wear the costume of men, and are ashamed of the sex in which they were
born; they cut their hair short, and raise their heads with the
shameless stare of eunuchs. There are some who put on Cilician
jackets, <span id="fr_2937"></span>[2938](#fn_2937.md) and with hoods made
up into shape, make themselves like horned owls and night birds, as if
they were becoming babies again.”

<span id="vi.xi.iii.vi-p6"></span>There are a thousand such calumnies,
and worse than these, in the book. He does not even spare widows, for he
says of them, <span id="fr_2938"></span>[2939](#fn_2938.md) “They care for
nothing but the belly and what is next it;” and he adds many other
obscene remarks of this kind. As to the whole race of Solitaries, it
would take too long to give the passages written by him in which he
attacks them with the foulest abuse. It would be a shame even to recount
the indecent attacks which he makes upon the Presbyters and the deacons.
I will, however, give the beginning of this violent invective, by which
you may easily imagine what a point he reaches in its later
stages. <span id="fr_2939"></span>[2940](#fn_2939.md)

<span id="vi.xi.iii.vi-p9"></span>“There are some,” he says, “of my own
order, who only seek the office of Presbyter or deacon so that they may
have more license to visit women. They care for nothing but to be well
dressed, to be well scented, to prevent their feet from being loose and
bulging. Their curly hair bears the mark of the crisping iron; their
fingers sparkle with rings; and they walk on tiptoe, for fear a fleck of
mud from the road should touch their feet. When you see them, you would
take them for bridegrooms rather than clerics.”

<span id="vi.xi.iii.vi-p10"></span>He then goes on to hurl his
reproaches against our priests and ministers, specifying their faults,
or rather their crimes; and to represent the access allowed them to
married ladies not only in a disgraceful light, but so as to seem
positively execrable: and after having cut to pieces with his satirical
defamation the whole race of Christians, he does not even spare himself,
as you shall presently hear.
