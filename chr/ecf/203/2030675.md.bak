<span id="vi.xi.ii.xxxviii-p1"></span> 35. But I beg you to listen
patiently as I follow him in his continual recurrence to these same
doctrines—not indeed in all that he says of them, for it is so much that
I should have to write many volumes if I tried to exhaust it—but as much
as will satisfy the reader that it is not by chance that he slips into
these notions which he now proposes for imitation to his disciples, but
that he supports them by large and frequent assertion. Let us see what
it is that he teaches us in these the most approved of his Commentaries.
In this same book he teaches that there is for men the possibility of
both rising and falling, not in the present age only but in that which
is to come. On the passage in which the words occur: “Far above all
Principality and Power and Might and Dominion, and every name that is
named not only in this age but in that which is to come,” he has the
following among other remarks:

<span id="vi.xi.ii.xxxviii-p2"></span>“If, however, there are
Principalities, Virtues, Powers and Dominions, they must necessarily
have subjects who fear them and serve them and gain power from their
strength; and this gradation of offices will exist not only in the
present age but in that which is to come; and it must be possible that
one may rise through these various stages of advancement and honour,
while another sinks, that there will be risings and fallings, and that
our spirits may pass under each of these Powers, Virtues,
Principalities, and Dominions one after the other.”
