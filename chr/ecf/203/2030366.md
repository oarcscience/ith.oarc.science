<span id="iv.x.clxxvii-p1"></span> *CLXXVI. Letter to the same Alexander
after he had learnt that John, Bishop of Antioch, had Anathematized the
Doctrine of Nestorius.* <span id="fr_2306"></span>[2307](#fn_2306)

<span id="iv.x.clxxvii-p3"></span>Be it known to your holiness that when
I read the letter addressed to the emperor I was much distressed,
because I know perfectly well that the writer of the letter, being of
the same opinions, has unwisely and <span id="page_346">p. 346</span>
<span id="iv.x.clxxvii-Page_346"></span>impiously condemned one who has
never held or taught anything contrary to sound doctrine. But the form
of anathema, though it be more likely than his assent to the
condemnation, to grieve a reader, nevertheless has given me some ground
of comfort, in that it is laid down not in wide general terms, but with
some qualification. For he has not said “We anathematize his doctrine”
but “whatever he has either said or held other than is warranted by the
doctrine of the apostles.”
