<span id="vi.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c21"><span
id="vi.iv-p1.1"></span>Preface to Book II.</span>

<span id="vi.iv-p2"></span>Rufinus, as we see by his Preface to the
former book, considered it unsatisfactory to expound the Blessing upon
Judah apart from those on his brethren. Paulinus therefore, taking the
occasion of their common friend Cerealis’ journey to Rome, sends the
following letter to induce Rufinus to expound the remaining
Benedictions.

<span id="vi.iv-p3"></span>Paulinus to his brother Rufinus, all good
wishes.

<span id="vi.iv-p4"></span>1. Although our son Cerealis declared to me
that it was uncertain whether, in returning as he now does to St.
Peter, <span id="fr_2778"></span>[2779](#fn_2778.md) he would be able to
visit you, yet it appears to me that it would be blamable in me and
vexatious to you were I not to write to you by him in whom you have a
part as well as I. It seems to me preferable to lose some letter paper
by his not visiting you rather than to lose credit with you as I think I
should do by his visiting you without it: and therefore I have en<span
id="page_419">p. 419</span> <span id="vi.iv-Page_419"></span>trusted
this letter, I will not say to chance, but to faith: for I believe that
the Lord will direct to you the way both of our son and of my letter;
since to those who long for good all will turn to good; and indeed he
longs for you as you ought to be longed for by one who understands the
good he may gain from your society. I believe that this longing of his
in a good matter will not be lost, according to his faith and piety: and
therefore I have confidence that he will reach you and abide with you,
and that I shall see the saving help of the Lord doubled towards you,
since in him you will have the accession of a good son and pupil and
assistant, and he will find in you a father and teacher of all good
things given to him from the Lord, who will add to the efficacy and
power of his prayers the strength of spiritual grace. As to myself,
though I have the assurance that when you return to the East you will be
unwilling to depart without visiting me, yet my sins make me fear that
the daughter of Babylon, may turn you away from me. I pray therefore
with earnest longings to the Lord that he would give me not according to
my deserts but according to my desire and may direct your course to me
in the way of peace; for such as do not walk in that way are reprobate
and condemned and incapable of truly longing for your presence.

<span id="vi.iv-p6"></span>2. But now for the business part of my
letter. I charge you, with the importunity, with which I am in the habit
of knocking at your door even in the middle of the night, being driven
by fear of a refusal to the modest attitude of a supplicant, to show me
kindness once more, and to expound the Benedictions on the twelve
Patriarchs. You have already made a beginning with the prophecy relating
to Judah, and have given, according to the precept, a threefold
interpretation of it. I now beg you to expound the prophecy as it
relates to each of the sons of Judah: so that I may myself become
possessed of the truth by your means, and may also gain through your
help the favor and the praise which will accrue to me; for I shall thus
be able to make answer to those who have thought well to consult me on
the difficulties of this passage of Scripture not with foolish words
drawn from my own understanding but with divine truth flowing from your
inspiration.

<span id="vi.iv-p7"></span>————————————

<span id="vi.iv-p8"></span>Rufinus, though at this time busy with his
larger works, the translations of Pamphilus’ defence of Origen, and
Origen’s <span class="Greek"><span id="vi.iv-p8.1"></span>Περὶ
᾽Αρχῶν</span>, and, though about to set out for Rome, lost no time in
composing the work which Paulinus demanded, and sent it him with the
following letter.

<span id="vi.iv-p9"></span>Rufinus to His Brother Paulinus, the Man of
God, with All Good Wishes.

<span id="vi.iv-p10"></span>1. Though our common son Cerealis did not
visit me, he felt what pain he would cause me if he delayed my reception
of your letter, and forwarded it to me. In reading it I felt, as usual,
a continual increase in my yearning towards you: but I found towards its
close a request from which I have frequently begged you to excuse me—I
mean the request which you make that I should write something in answer
to your questions as to the interpretation of passages of Scripture. I
thought that I should lead you to desist from these questions by the
writings I have once and again sent you, which have given evidence of my
ignorance and of the roughness of my speech.

<span id="vi.iv-p11"></span>2. But since you still are not weary of
commanding me, I have at once, to the best of my powers, added to what I
had written at your desire on the Benediction of Judah the comments on
the remaining eleven patriarchs. I acted like the man in the parable of
the two sons. I thought that I should thus best fulfil the father’s
will: and though when he ordered me to go into the vineyard I had said I
will not go, yet after a while I went. If, as I grant, there is some
rashness in the fact that with so little capacity we attempt such a
great task, I would say, with submission to you, that this must be most
justly imputed to you, since, through your excessive love for me you do
not see that my measure of knowledge, as of other virtues, is but
slight. I wrote this work in the days of Lent, while I was staying in
the monastery of Pinetum, and I wrote it for you. But I found it
impossible to conceal this poor work from the brethren who were there:
and they, considering that a thing which had been honoured by your
approval must be of great importance, extorted from me the permission to
copy it for themselves. Thus, while you demand from me food for yourself
you give refreshment to others also. Farewell, and be in peace, my most
loving brother, most true worshipper of God, and an Israelite in whom
there is no guile. I entreat you who are so full of the grace of God to
hold me still in remembrance.
