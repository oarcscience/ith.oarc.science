<span id="iv.x.lxxxv-p1"></span> *LXXXV. To the Bishop Basil. <span
id="fr_1783"></span>[1784](#fn_1783.md)*

<span id="iv.x.lxxxv-p3"></span>The chief good is said by the divine
Paul to be love, <span id="fr_1784"></span>[1785](#fn_1784.md) and by love
he ordered the nurslings of the faith to be fed. Of this love your piety
possesses great wealth, and so has told me what was befitting and given
me pleasant news. For to them that fear the Lord what can be pleasanter
than the health and harmony of the doctrines of the truth? Be well
assured, most godly sir, that we were much delighted to hear the
intelligence of our common friend; and in proportion to our previous
distress at hearing that he described the nature of flesh and of Godhead
as one, and openly attributed the passion of salvation to the impassible
Godhead, so were all rejoiced to read the letters of your holiness, and
to learn that he maintains in their integrity the properties of the
natures and denies both the change of God the Word into flesh, and the
mutation of the flesh into the nature of Godhead, maintaining on the
contrary that in the one Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, God the Word made
man, the properties of either nature abide unconfounded. We praise the
God of all for the harmony of divine faith. We have however written to
either Cilicia, <span id="fr_1785"></span>[1786](#fn_1785.md) although our
intelligence is imperfect, as to whether there are really any opponents
of the truth, and have charged the godly bishops to search and examine
if there are any who divide the one Lord Jesus Christ into two sons, and
either to bring them to their senses by admonition, or cut them off from
the roll of the brethren. For in fact we equally repudiate both those
who dare to assert one nature of flesh and Godhead, and those who divide
the one Lord Jesus Christ into two sons and strive to go beyond the
definitions of the Apostles.

<span id="iv.x.lxxxv-p6"></span>But let your holiness be well assured
that we are disposed to peace. For if the prophet says, “With them that
hate peace I was peaceful,” <span id="fr_1786"></span>[1787](#fn_1786.md)
much more readily do we welcome the peace of God.

<span id="iv.x.lxxxv-p8"></span>Some of those men who have been fed on
lies have hurried to Alexandria and patched up calumnies against me,
with the result that the godly bishop of that city, led away by their
statements, although he had been fully informed by my letters, has sent
a pious bishop to the imperial city. I beg you therefore to shew your
accustomed kindness to him, and to confront falsehood with the truth.

<span id="iv.x.lxxxv-p2"></span> There appears to be nothing in this
letter or in Letter CII. also addressed to bishop Basil to identify the
recipient. Basil bishop of Seleucia in Isauria was at the Latrocinium
and at Chalcedon. Basil, bishop of Trajanopolis was also present at the
same councils. Garnerius is in favour of the former, and notes the date
as 448.
