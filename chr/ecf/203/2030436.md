id="fr_2461"></span>[2462](#fn_2461) </span> the presbyter, now regarded
as chief of the Latin writers after Victor and Apollonius, was from the
city of Carthage in the province of Africa, and was the son of a
proconsul or Centurion, a man of keen and vigorous character, he
flourished chiefly in the reign of the emperor Severus and Antoninus
Caracalla and wrote many volumes which we pass by because they are well
known to most. I myself have seen a certain Paul an old man of
Concordia, a town of Italy, who, while he himself was a very young man
had been secretary to the blessed Cyprian who was already advanced in
age. He said that he himself had seen how Cyprian was accustomed never
to pass a day without reading Tertullian, and that he frequently said to
him, “Give me the master,” meaning by this, Tertullian. He was presbyter
of the church until middle life, afterwards driven by the envy and abuse
of the clergy of the Roman church, he lapsed to the doctrine of
Montanus, and mentions the new prophecy in many of his books.

<span id="v.iii.lv-p4"></span>He composed, moreover, directly against
the church, volumes: *On modesty, On persecution, On fasts, On
monogamy,* six books *On ecstasy,* and a seventh which he wrote *Against
Apollonius.* He is said to have lived to a decrepit old age, and to have
composed many small works, which are not extant.
