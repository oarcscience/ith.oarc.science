<span id="iv.viii.i.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.i.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI</span>.—*General Council of
Nicæa*.

<span id="iv.viii.i.vii-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.i.vii-p2.1"></span>The</span> emperor, who possessed the
most profound wisdom, having heard of these things, endeavoured, as a
first step, to stop up their fountain-head. He therefore despatched a
messenger renowned for his ready wit to Alexandria with letters, in the
endeavour to extinguish the dispute, and expecting to reconcile the
disputants. But his hopes having been frustrated, he proceeded to summon
the celebrated council of Nicæa <span id="fr_332"></span>[333](#fn_332.md)
; and pledged his word that the bishops and their officials should be
furnished with asses, mules, and horses for their journey at the public
expense. When all those who were capable of enduring the fatigue of the
journey had arrived at Nicæa, he went thither himself, with both the
wish of seeing the multitude of bishops, and the yearning desire of
maintaining unanimity amongst them. He at once arranged that all their
wants should be liberally supplied. Three hundred and eighteen bishops
were assembled. The bishop of Rome <span
id="fr_333"></span>[334](#fn_333.md) , on account of his very advanced age,
was absent, but he sent two presbyters <span
id="fr_334"></span>[335](#fn_334.md) to the council, with authority to
agree to what was done.

<span id="iv.viii.i.vii-p6"></span>At this period many individuals were
richly endowed with apostolical gifts; and many, like the holy apostle,
bore in their bodies the marks of the Lord Jesus Christ <span
id="fr_335"></span>[336](#fn_335.md) . James, bishop of Antioch, a city of
Mygdonia, which is called Nisibis by the Syrians and Assyrians, raised
the dead and restored them to life, and performed many other wonders
which it would be superfluous to mention again in detail in this
history, as I have already given an account of them in my work, entitled
“Philotheus <span id="fr_336"></span>[337](#fn_336.md) .” Paul, bishop of
Neo-Cæsarea, a fortress situated on the banks of the Euphrates, had
suffered from the frantic rage of Licinius. He had been deprived of the
use of both hands by the application of a red-hot iron, by which the
nerves which give motion to the muscles had been contracted and rendered
dead. Some had had the right eye dug out, others had lost the right arm.
Among these was Paphnutius of Egypt. In short, the Council looked like
an assembled army of martyrs. Yet this holy and celebrated gathering was
not entirely free from the element of opposition; for there were some,
though so few as easily to be reckoned, of fair surface, like dangerous
shallows, who really, though not openly, supported the blasphemy of
Arius.

<span id="iv.viii.i.vii-p9"></span>When they were all assembled <span
id="fr_337"></span>[338](#fn_337.md) , the emperor ordered a great hall to
be prepared for their accommodation in the palace, in which a sufficient
number of benches and seats were placed; and having thus arranged that
they should be treated with becoming dignity, he desired the bishops to
enter in, and discuss the subjects proposed. The emperor, with a few
attendants, was the last to enter the room; remarkable for his lofty
stature, and worthy of admiration for personal beauty, and for the still
more marvellous modesty which dwelt on his countenance. A low stool was
placed for him in the middle of the assembly, upon which, however, he
did not seat himself until he had asked the permission of the bishops.
Then all the sacred assembly sat down around him. Then forthwith rose
first the great Eustathius, bishop of Antioch, who, upon the translation
of Philogonius, already referred to, to a better life, had been
compelled reluctantly to become his successor by the unanimous suffrages
of the bishops, priests, and of the Christ-loving laity. He crowned the
emperor’s head with the flowers of panegyric, and commended the diligent
attention he had manifested in the regulation of ecclesiastical affairs.

<span id="iv.viii.i.vii-p11"></span>The excellent emperor next exhorted
the Bishops to unanimity and concord; he recalled to their remembrance
the cruelty of the late tyrants, and reminded them of the honourable
peace which God had, in his reign and by his means, accorded them. He
pointed out how dreadful it was, aye, very dreadful, that at the very
time when their enemies were destroyed, and when no one dared to oppose
them, they should fall upon one another, and make their amused
adversaries laugh, especially as they were debating about holy <span
id="page_44">p. 44</span> <span
id="iv.viii.i.vii-Page_44"></span>things, concerning which they had the
written teaching of the Holy Spirit. “For the gospels” (continued he),
“the apostolical writings, and the oracles of the ancient prophets,
clearly teach us what we ought to believe concerning the divine nature.
Let, then, all contentious disputation be discarded; and let us seek in
the divinely-inspired word the solution of the questions at issue.”
These and similar exhortations he, like an affectionate son, addressed
to the bishops as to fathers, labouring to bring about their unanimity
in the apostolical doctrines. Most members of the synod, won over by his
arguments, established concord among themselves, and embraced sound
doctrine. There were, however, a few, of whom mention has been already
made, who opposed these doctrines, and sided with Arius; and amongst
them were Menophantus, bishop of Ephesus, Patrophilus, bishop of
Scythopolis, Theognis, bishop of Nicæa, and Narcissus, bishop of
Neronias, which is a town of the second Cilicia, and is now called
Irenopolis; also Theonas, bishop of Marmarica, and Secundus, bishop of
Ptolemais in Egypt <span id="fr_338"></span>[339](#fn_338.md) . They drew
up a formulary of their faith, and presented it to the council. As soon
as it was read it was torn to pieces, and was declared to be spurious
and false. So great was the uproar raised against them, and so many were
the reproaches cast on them for having betrayed religion, that they all,
with the exception of Secundus and Theonas, stood up and took the lead
in publicly renouncing Arius. This impious man, having thus been
expelled from the Church, a confession of faith which is received to
this day was drawn up by unanimous consent; and, as soon as it was
signed, the council was dissolved.

at Nicæa, but escaped by a feigned acceptance.

says that he was thrice degraded by different synods, and is the worst
of the Eusebians (*Ath. Ap. de fuga,* sec. 28).

Cilicia was divided into three districts; Cilicia Prima, with Tarsus for
chief town; Secunda, with Anazarbus; Tertia, with Seleuceia.
