<span id="iv.viii.iii.xviii-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.iii.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVIII</span>.—*Of the
prediction of the pedagogue*.

<span id="iv.viii.iii.xviii-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.iii.xviii-p2.1"></span>Another</span> instance is that of an
excellent man at Antioch, entrusted with the charge of young lads, who
was better educated than is usually the case with pedagogues, <span
id="fr_653"></span>[654](#fn_653) and was the intimate friend of the
chief teacher of that period, Libanius the far-famed sophist.

<span id="iv.viii.iii.xviii-p4"></span>Now Libanius <span
id="fr_654"></span>[655](#fn_654) was a heathen expecting victory and
bearing in mind the threats of Julian, so one day, in ridicule of our
belief he said to the pedagogue, “What is the carpenter’s son about
now?” Filled with divine grace, he foretold what was shortly to come to
pass. “Sophist,” said he, “the Creator of all things, whom you in
derision call carpenter’s son, is making a coffin.” <span
id="fr_655"></span>[656](#fn_655)

<span id="iv.viii.iii.xviii-p7"></span>After a few days the death of the
wretch was announced. He was carried out lying in his coffin. The vaunt
of his threats was proved vain, and God was glorified. <span

<span id="iv.viii.iii.xviii-p3"></span> The word seems here used in its
strictly Athenian sense of a slave who took charge of boys on their way
between school and home (Vide Lycias 910. 2 and Plat. Rep. 373. C.)
rather than in the more general sense of teacher. In Xen. Lac. 3. 1. it
is coupled with <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.viii.iii.xviii-p3.1"></span>διδάσκαλος</span>: here it is
contrasted with it.

<span id="fn_654"></span>[105:655](2030101.htm#fr_654) <span

<span id="iv.viii.iii.xviii-p5"></span> “One of the most noteworthy and
characteristic figures of expiring heathenism.” J.R. Mozley, Dict.
Christ. Biog. s.v. Born in Antioch <span class="c14"><span
id="iv.viii.iii.xviii-p5.1"></span>a.d.</span> 314, he died about the
close of the century. He was a voluminous author, and wrote among other
things a “vain, prolix, but curious narrative of his own life.” Gibbon.
The most complete account of him will be found in E. R. Siever’s Das
Leben des Libanius.

<span id="fn_655"></span>[105:656](2030101.htm#fr_655) <span
id="iv.viii.iii.xviii-p5.2"></span>

<span id="iv.viii.iii.xviii-p6"></span> The form in the text (<span
class="Greek"><span
id="iv.viii.iii.xviii-p6.1"></span>γλωσσόκομον</span>) is rejected by
Attic purists, but is used twice by St. John, as well as in the
Septuagint. In <span id="iv.viii.iii.xviii-p6.2"></span>[2 Chron. xxiv.
8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#008)<span
id="iv.viii.iii.xviii-p6.3"></span> (cf. <span
id="iv.viii.iii.xviii-p6.4"></span>[2 Kings xii.
9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#009)<span
id="iv.viii.iii.xviii-p6.5"></span>) it means a chest. In [John
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#006), [John
13:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#029)<span
id="iv.viii.iii.xviii-p6.6"></span> it is “the bag,” properly ([John
11.3](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#003)<span
id="iv.viii.iii.xviii-p6.7"></span>) “box,” which Judas carried. In the
Palatine anthology Nicanor the coffin maker makes these “glossokoma” or
coffins. Derivatively the word means “tongue-cases,” i.e. cases to keep
the tongues or reeds of musical instruments. An instance of similar
transfer of meaning is our word “coffin;” derivatively a wicker
basket;—at one time any case or cover, and in Shakespeare (Titus
Andronicus Act V. 2, 189) pie crust. Perhaps “casket,” which now still
holds many things, may one day only hold a corpse.

<span id="fn_656"></span>[105:657](2030101.htm#fr_656) <span
id="iv.viii.iii.xviii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iv.viii.iii.xviii-p8"></span> In times and circumstances
totally different, it may seem that Julian’s courtesy and moderation
contrast favourably with the fierce zeal of the Christians. A modern
illustration of the temper of the Church in Julian’s reign may be found
in the following account given of his dragoman by the late author of
“Eothen.” “Religion and the literature of the Church which he served had
made him a man, and a brave man too. The lives of his honored Saints
were full of heroic actions provoking imitation, and since faith in a
creed involves faith its ultimate triumph, Dthemetri was bold from a
sense of true strength; his education too, though not very general in
its character, had been carried quite far enough to justify him in
pluming himself upon a very decided advantage over the great bulk of the
Mahometan population, including the men in authority. With all this
consciousness of religious and intellectual superiority, Dthemetri had
lived for the most part in countries lying under Mussulman governments,
and had witnessed (perhaps too had suffered from) their revolting
cruelties; the result was that he abhorred and despised the Mussulman
faith and all who clung to it. And this hate was not of the dull, dry,
and inactive sort; Dthemetri was in his way a true crusader, and
whenever there appeared a fair opening in the defence of Islam, he was
ready and eager to make the assault. Such feelings, backed by a
consciousness of understanding the people with whom he had to do, made
Dthemetri not only firm and resolute in his constant interviews with men
in authority, but sometimes also very violent and very insulting.”
Kinglake’s “Eothen,” 5th Ed., p. 270.
