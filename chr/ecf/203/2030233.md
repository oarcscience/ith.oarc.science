<span id="iv.x.xliv-p1"></span> *XLIV. To the Patrician* <span
id="fr_1686"></span>[1687](#fn_1686) *Senator.*

<span id="iv.x.xliv-p3"></span>Thanks be to the Saviour of the world
because to your greatness He is ever adding dignity and honour. The
reason of my not writing up to this time to exhibit the delight which I
have felt at the colophon <span id="fr_1687"></span>[1688](#fn_1687) of
your honour, has been my wish not to trouble your magnificence. At the
moment of my now thus writing, the district which Providence has
committed to my care stands as the proverb has it on a razor’s
edge. <span id="fr_1688"></span>[1689](#fn_1688) You will remember the
visitation which was made at the time when we first were benefited by
your presence among us; how it was <span id="page_265">p. 265</span>
<span id="iv.x.xliv-Page_265"></span>with difficulty established in the
time of the most excellent prefect the Lord Florentius; <span
id="fr_1689"></span>[1690](#fn_1689) and how it was confirmed by the
present holder of the office. An individual who bears the name of
bishop, but of ways unworthy even of stage players, has fled from the
episcopal synod at a time when he was lying under sentence of
excommunication and is endeavouring to calumniate and discredit the
visitation, while through his hatred to the illustrious Philip he
assails the truth. I therefore beseech your excellency to make his lies
of none effect, and that the visitation lawfully confirmed may remain
undisturbed. It is indeed becoming to your greatness to reap the fruit
of this good deed among the rest, to receive the acclamations of those
whom you are benefiting, and so to do honour at once to the God of all
and to his true servant the very man of God the Lord Jacob, <span
id="fr_1690"></span>[1691](#fn_1690) who joins with me in sending you
this supplication. Had it been his wont to write he would have written
himself.
