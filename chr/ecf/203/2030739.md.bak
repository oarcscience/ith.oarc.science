<span id="vi.xii.i.i-p1"></span> <span class="c21"><span
id="vi.xii.i.i-p1.1"></span>Jerome’s Apology for Himself Against the
Books of Rufinus.</span>

<span id="vi.xii.i.i-p2"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="vi.xii.i.i-p2.1"></span>Addressed to Pammachius and Marcella from
Bethlehem, <span class="c14"><span
id="vi.xii.i.i-p2.2"></span>a.d.</span> 402.</span>

<span id="vi.xii.i.i-p3"></span>————————————

<span id="vi.xii.i.i-p4"></span><span class="c21"><span
id="vi.xii.i.i-p4.1"></span>Book I.</span>

<span id="vi.xii.i.i-p5"></span>The documents which Jerome had before
him when he wrote his Apology were (1) Rufinus’ Translation of
Pamphilus’ Apology with the Preface prefixed to it and the book on the
Falsification of the Books of Origen, (2) the Translation of the <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xii.i.i-p5.1"></span>Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν</span> and
Rufinus’ Preface, (3) The Apology of Rufinus addressed to Anastasius
(see p. 430), and (4) Anastasius’ letter to John of Jerusalem (p. 432
Apol. ii, 14, iii, 20). He had also other letters of Anastasius like
that addressed to the Bishop of Milan (Jerome Letter 95. See also Apol.
iii, 21). But he had not the full text of Rufinus’ Apology (c. 4, 15).
He received letters from Pammachius and Marcella, at the beginning of
the Spring of 402, when the Apology written at Aquileia at the end of
400 had become known to Rufinus’ friends for some time. They had been
unable to obtain a full copy, but had sent the chief heads of it, and
had strongly urged Jerome to reply. At the same time his brother
Paulinianus who had been some three years in the West, returned to
Palestine by way of Rome, and there heard and saw portions of Rufinus’
Apology, which he committed to memory (Apol. i, 21, 28) and repeated at
Bethlehem. To these documents Jerome replies.

<span id="vi.xii.i.i-p6"></span>The heads of the First Book are as
follows.

<span id="vi.xii.i.i-p7"></span>1. It is hard that an old friend with
whom I had been reconciled should attack me in a book secretly
circulated among his disciples.

<span id="vi.xii.i.i-p8"></span>2. Others have translated Origen. Why
does he single me out?

<span id="vi.xii.i.i-p9"></span>3. He gave me fictitious praise in his
Preface to the <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xii.i.i-p9.1"></span>Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν</span>. Now, since I defend
myself, he writes 3 books against me as an enemy.

<span id="vi.xii.i.i-p10"></span>4, 5. He spoke of me as united in faith
with him; but what is his faith? Why are his books kept secret? I can
meet any attack.

<span id="vi.xii.i.i-p11"></span>6. I translated the <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xii.i.i-p11.1"></span>Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν</span>
because you demanded it, and because his translation slurred over
Origen’s heresies.

<span id="vi.xii.i.i-p12"></span>7. My translation put away ambiguities,
and showed the real character of the book, and of the previous
translation.

<span id="vi.xii.i.i-p13"></span>8. My translation of Origen’s
Commentaries created no excitement; his first translation, of Pamphilus’
Apology, roused all Rome to indignation.

<span id="vi.xii.i.i-p14"></span>9. But the work was really Eusebius’s,
who tells us that Pamphilus wrote nothing.

<span id="vi.xii.i.i-p15"></span>10. After the condemnation of Origen by
Theophilus and Anastasius, it would be wise in Rufinus to give up this
pretended defence.

<span id="vi.xii.i.i-p16"></span>11. I had praised Eusebius as well as
Origen only as writers; and was forced to condemn them as heretics. Why
should this be taken amiss?

<span id="vi.xii.i.i-p17"></span>12. I wrote a friendly letter to
Rufinus, which my friends kept back.

<span id="vi.xii.i.i-p18"></span>13. There is nothing to blame in my
getting the help of a Jew in translating from the Hebrew.

<span id="vi.xii.i.i-p19"></span>14. There is nothing strange in my
praising Origen before I knew the <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xii.i.i-p19.1"></span>Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν</span>

<span id="vi.xii.i.i-p20"></span><span id="page_483">p. 483</span> <span
id="vi.xii.i.i-Page_483"></span>15. The accusations seem inconsistent,
but I knew them only by report.

<span id="vi.xii.i.i-p21"></span>16. The office of a commentator.

<span id="vi.xii.i.i-p22"></span>17. We must distinguish methods of
writing, and not expect a vulgar simplicity in the various compositions
of cultured men.

<span id="vi.xii.i.i-p23"></span>18. My assertion was true, that Origen
permitted the use of falsehood.

<span id="vi.xii.i.i-p24"></span>19. The accusation about a
mistranslation of Ps. ii is easily explained.

<span id="vi.xii.i.i-p25"></span>20. In the difficulties of the
translator and the commentator we must get help where we can.

<span id="vi.xii.i.i-p26"></span>21. In the Commentary on Ephesians I
acted straightforwardly in giving the views of Origen and others.

<span id="vi.xii.i.i-p27"></span>22. As to the passage “He hath chosen
us before the foundation of the world.”

<span id="vi.xii.i.i-p28"></span>23. As to the passage “Far above all
rule and authority &c.”

<span id="vi.xii.i.i-p29"></span>24. As to the passage “That in the ages
to come &c.”

<span id="vi.xii.i.i-p30"></span>25. As to “Paul the prisoner of Jesus
Christ.”

<span id="vi.xii.i.i-p31"></span>26. As to “The body fitly framed &c.”

<span id="vi.xii.i.i-p32"></span>27. I quoted Origen’s views as,
“According to another heresy.”

<span id="vi.xii.i.i-p33"></span>28, 29. As to “Men loving their wives
as their own bodies.”

<span id="vi.xii.i.i-p34"></span>30. To the charge of reading secular
books I reply that I remember what I learned in youth.

<span id="vi.xii.i.i-p35"></span>31. Also, a promise given in a dream
must not be pressed. Why should such things be raked up by old friends
against one another?

<span id="vi.xii.i.i-p36"></span>32. I am right in my contention that
all sins are remitted in baptism.
