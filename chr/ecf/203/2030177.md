<span id="iv.viii.v.xxxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.v.xxxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXVII</span>.—*Of Theodotus
bishop of Antioch*.

<span id="iv.viii.v.xxxvii-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.v.xxxvii-p2.1"></span>Theodosius</span> restored the relics
of the great luminary of the world to the city which deeply regretted
his loss. These events however happened later. <span

<span id="iv.viii.v.xxxvii-p4"></span>Innocent the excellent bishop of
Rome <span id="page_157">p. 157</span> <span
id="iv.viii.v.xxxvii-Page_157"></span>was succeeded by Bonifacius,
Bonifacius by Zosimus and Zosimus by Cælestinus. <span
id="fr_944"></span>[945](#fn_944)

<span id="iv.viii.v.xxxvii-p7"></span>At Jerusalem after the admirable
John the charge of the church was committed to Praylius, a man worthy of
his name. <span id="fr_945"></span>[946](#fn_945)

<span id="iv.viii.v.xxxvii-p9"></span>At Antioch after the divine
Alexander Theodotus, the pearl of purity, succeeded to the supremacy of
the church, a man of conspicuous meekness and of exact regularity of
life. By him the sect of Apollinarius was admitted to fellowship with
the rest of the sheep on the earnest request of its members to be united
with the flock. Many of them however continued marked by their former
unsoundness. <span id="fr_946"></span>[947](#fn_946)

<span id="iv.viii.v.xxxvii-p3"></span> This paragraph belongs more
appropriately to the preceding chapter. The relics of Chrysostom were
translated in 438.

<span id="fn_944"></span>[157:945](2030177.htm#fr_944) <span
id="iv.viii.v.xxxvii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="iv.viii.v.xxxvii-p5"></span> The accepted order is Innocent I.
402–417; Zosimus 417–418; Boniface I. 418–422; Cælestinus 422–432.

<span id="iv.viii.v.xxxvii-p6"></span>The decision of Honorius in favour
of Bonifacius as against Eulalius, both elected by their respective
supporters on the death of Zosimus in 418, marks an important point in
the interference of temporal princes in the appointments of bishops of
Rome. cf. Robertson, i. 498.

<span id="iv.viii.v.xxxvii-p10"></span> Apollinarians survived the
condemnation of Apollinarius at Constantinople in 381.

<span id="iv.viii.v.xxxvii-p11"></span>The unsoundness, i.e. the denial
of the rational soul, and so of the perfect manhood of the Saviour, is
discussed in Dial. I.
