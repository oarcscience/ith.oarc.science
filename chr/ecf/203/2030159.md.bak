<span id="iv.viii.v.xix-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.v.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIX</span>.—*Of the sedition of
Antioch*. <span id="fr_880"></span>[881](#fn_880.md)

<span id="iv.viii.v.xix-p3"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.v.xix-p3.1"></span>In</span> consequence of his continual
wars the emperor was compelled to impose heavy taxes on the cities of
the empire. <span id="fr_881"></span>[882](#fn_881.md)

<span id="iv.viii.v.xix-p5"></span>The city of Antioch refused to put up
with the new tax, and when the people saw the victims of its exaction
subjected to torture and indignity, then, in addition to the usual deeds
which a mob is wont to do when it is seizing an opportunity for
disorder, they pulled down the bronze statue of the illustrious
Placilla, for so was the empress named, and dragged it over a great part
of the town. <span id="fr_882"></span>[883](#fn_882.md) On being informed
of these events the emperor, as was to be expected, was indignant. He
then deprived the city of her privileges, and gave her dignity to her
neighbour, with the idea that thus he could inflict on her the greatest
indignity, for Antioch from the earliest times had had a rival in
Laodicea. <span id="fr_883"></span>[884](#fn_883.md) He further threatened
to burn and destroy the town and reduce it to the rank of a village. The
magistrates however had arrested some men in the very act, and had put
them to death before the tragedy came to the emperor’s ears. All these
orders had been given by the Emperor, but had not been carried out
because of the restriction imposed by the edict which had been made by
the advice of the great Ambrosius. <span
id="fr_884"></span>[885](#fn_884.md) On the arrival of the commissioners
who <span id="page_146">p. 146</span> <span
id="iv.viii.v.xix-Page_146"></span>brought the emperor’s threats,
Elebichus, then a military commander, and Cæsarius prefect of the
palace, styled by the Romans *magister officiorum,* <span
id="fr_885"></span>[886](#fn_885.md) the whole population shuddered in
consternation. But the athletes of virtue, <span
id="fr_886"></span>[887](#fn_886.md) dwelling at the foot of the hill, of
whom at that time there were many of the best, made many supplications
and entreaties to the imperial officers. The most holy Macedonius, who
was quite unversed in the things of this life, and altogether ignorant
of the sacred oracles, living on the tops of the mountains, and night
and day offering up pure prayers to the Saviour of all, was not in the
least dismayed at the imperial violence, nor at all affected by the
power of the commissioners. As they rode into the middle of the town he
caught hold of one of them by the cloak and bade both of them dismount.
At the sight of a little old man, clad in common rags, they were at
first indignant, but some of those who were conducting them informed
them of the high character of Macedonius, and then they sprang from
their horses, caught hold of his knees, and asked his pardon. The old
man, urged on by divine wisdom, spoke to them in the following terms:
“Say, dear sirs, to the emperor; you are not only an emperor, you are
also a man. Bethink you, therefore, not only of your sovereignty, but
also of your nature. You are a man, and you reign over your fellow men.
Now the nature of man is formed after the image and likeness of God. Do
not, therefore, thus savagely and cruelly order the massacre of God’s
image, for by punishing His image you will anger the Maker. Think how
you are acting thus in your wrath for the sake of a brazen image. Now
all who are endued with reason know how far a lifeless image is inferior
to one alive and gifted with soul and sense. Take into account, too,
that for one image of bronze we can easily make many more. Even you
yourself cannot make one single hair of the slain.”

<span id="iv.viii.v.xix-p11"></span>After the good men had heard these
words they reported them to the emperor, and quenched the flame of his
rage. Instead of his threats he wrote a defence, and explained the cause
of his anger. “It was not right,” said he, “because I was in error, that
indignity should be inflicted after her death on a woman so worthy of
the highest praise. They that were aggrieved ought to have armed their
anger against me.” The emperor further added that he was grieved and
distressed when he heard that some had been executed by the magistrates.
In relating these events I have had a twofold object. I did not think it
right to leave in oblivion the boldness of the illustrious monk, and I
wished to point out the advantage of the edict which was put out by the
advice of the great Ambrosius. <span id="fr_887"></span>[888](#fn_887.md)

<span id="iv.viii.v.xix-p2"></span> Flacilla died as has been said, in
Sept. 385. The revolt at Thessalonica was in 390, and the disturbances
at Antioch in 387. The chapters of Theodoret do not follow chronological
order.

<span id="iv.viii.v.xix-p4"></span> More probably the money was wanted
to defray the expenses of magnificent fêtes in honour of the young
Arcadius, including a liberal donation to the army. On the whole
incident see Chrysostom’s famous *Homilies on the Statues.*

id="iv.viii.v.xix-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iv.viii.v.xix-p6"></span> The mob looted the baths, smashed
the hanging lamps, attacked the prætorium, insulted the imperial
portrait, and tore down the bronze statues of Theodosius and his
deceased wife from their pedestals, and dragged them through the
streets. A “whiff” of arrows from the guard calmed the oriental Paris of
the 4th century.

coast, so called after the mother of Seleucus Nicator, and now Latakia.

<span id="iv.viii.v.xix-p8"></span> Theodoret apparently refers to the
advice given by Ambrosius after the massacre of Thessalonica, which, as
we have said, took place three years *after* the insurrection at
Antioch.
