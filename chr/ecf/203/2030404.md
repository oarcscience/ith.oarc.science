great learning, wrote a strong refutation of the twenty-four volumes
which Basilides the heretic had written against the Gospel, disclosing
all his mysteries and enumerating the prophets Barcabbas and
Barchob <span id="fr_2414"></span>[2415](#fn_2414.md) and all the other
barbarous names which terrify the hearers, and his most high God
Abraxas, whose name was supposed to contain the year according to the
reckoning <span id="fr_2415"></span>[2416](#fn_2415.md) of the Greeks.
Basilides died at Alexandria in the reign of Hadrian, and from him the
Gnostic sects arose. In this tempestuous time also, Cochebas leader of
the Jewish faction put Christians to death with various tortures.
