<span id="iv.x.lxxix-p1"></span> *LXXIX. To Anatolius the
Patrician.* <span id="fr_1750"></span>[1751](#fn_1750.md)

<span id="iv.x.lxxix-p3"></span>The Lord God has given your excellency
to us to be at the present time a source of very great comfort, and has
afforded us a meet haven for the storm. We have therefore confidence in
informing your lordship of our distress. Not long ago we acquainted your
excellency that the right honourable Count Rufus had shewn us an order
written in the imperial handwriting commanding the gallant general to
provide with prudence and diligence for our residence at Cyrus, and not
to suffer us to depart to another city, on the ground that we are
endeavouring to summon synods to Antioch, and are disturbing the
orthodox. <span id="fr_1751"></span>[1752](#fn_1751.md) Now I make known to
you that in obedience to the imperial letter I have come to Cyrus. After
an interval of six or seven days they sent the devoted Euphronius, the
commander, with a letter begging me to acknowledge in writing that the
imperial order had been shown me. I therefore promised to remain in
Cyrus and its adjacent district, and to tend the sheep entrusted to my
care. I therefore beseech your excellency to make exact enquiry, both
whether these orders had really been issued, and for what reason. I am
indeed conscious of many other sins, but I do not know that I have erred
either against the Church of God, or against public order. And I write
as I do, not because I take it ill to have to live at Cyrus, for in
truth she is dearer to me than any of the most famous cities, because my
office in her has been given me by God. But the fact of my being bound
to her not by preference but by compulsion does seem somewhat grievous,
and besides it does give a handle to the wicked to grow bold and to
refuse to obey our exhortations.

<span id="iv.x.lxxix-p5"></span>Under these circumstances I beseech your
lordship, if no order of the kind has really been issued, to let me
know; but if the letter really comes from the victorious emperor, tell
his pious majesty not readily to believe calumnies, nor give ear to
accusers alone, but to demand an account from the accused. Though really
the evidence of the facts alone was quite enough to persuade his piety
that the charges against me were false. For when did I ever make myself
offensive about anything to his serene majesty or his chief officers? Or
when was I ever obnoxious to the many and illustrious owners here? It is
on the contrary well known to your excellency that I have spent a
considerable portion of my ecclesiastical revenues in erecting porticoes
and baths, building bridges, and making further provision for public
objects. But if any persons take it ill that I mourn over the ruin of
the churches of Phœnicia, be it known to your lordship that it is
impossible for me not to grieve when I see the horn of the Jews exalted
on high and the Christians in tears and sorrow, though they send them to
the very ends of the earth. <span id="fr_1752"></span>[1753](#fn_1752.md)
We cannot fight against the apostolic decrees, for we remember the word
of the Apostle which says, “We ought to obey God rather than men,” <span
id="fr_1753"></span>[1754](#fn_1753.md) and more terrible to us than any of
the pains of this life is the “judgment seat of Christ” <span
id="fr_1754"></span>[1755](#fn_1754.md) the Lord, before whom we shall all
stand to render an account of our words and of our deeds. On account of
that judgment seat the hardships of this present life must be endured.
For them that suffer wrong the hope of what is to come is consolation
enough, but to us the loving Lord has given further comfort in you, most
excellent sir, whose life is bright with piety and faith.

<span id="iv.x.lxxix-p4"></span> This edict of Theodosius is dated by
Tillemont March 30, 449. Theodoret received the order for his relegation
to Cyrus while he was at Antioch, and at once submitted.

<span id="iv.x.lxxix-p6"></span> The allusion appears to be to the edict
of Feb. 448, ordering the deposition of Theodoret’s friend Irenæus
bishop of Tyre, on the ground of his being a digamus and a heretic.
Irenæus was degraded from the priesthood and forbidden to appear in
Tyre. cf. Epp. III. XII. XVI. XXXV.
