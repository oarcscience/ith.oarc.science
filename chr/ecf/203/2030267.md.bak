<span id="iv.x.lxxviii"></span>

<span id="iv.x.lxxviii-p1"></span> *LXXVIII. To Eusebius, Bishop of
Persian Armenia.*

<span id="iv.x.lxxviii-p2"></span>Whenever anything happens to the
helmsman, either the officer in command at the bows, or the seaman of
highest rank, takes his place, not because he becomes a self-appointed
helmsman, but because he looks out for the safety of the ship. So again
in war, when the commander falls, the chief tribune assumes the command,
not in the attempt to lay violent hands on the place of power, but
because he cares for his men. So too the thrice blessed Timothy when
sent by the divine Paul took his place. <span
id="fr_1738"></span>[1739](#fn_1738.md) It is therefore becoming to your
piety to accept the responsibilities of helmsman, of captain, of
shepherd, gladly to run all risk for the sake of the sheep of Christ,
and not to leave His creatures abandoned and alone. It is rather yours
to bind up the broken, to raise up the fallen, to turn the wanderer from
his error, and keep the whole in health, and to follow the good
shepherds who stand before the folds and wage war against the wolves.
Let us remember too the words of the patriarch Jacob; “In the day the
drought consumed me and the frost by night and my sleep departed from my
eyes. The rams of thy flock I have not eaten. That which was born of
beasts I brought not unto thee. I bare the loss of it. Of my hand didst
thou require it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night.” <span
id="fr_1739"></span>[1740](#fn_1739.md) These are the marks of the
shepherd; these are the laws of the tending of the sheep. And if of
brute cattle the illustrious patriarch had such care, and offered this
defence to him who trusted them to his charge, what ought not we to do
who are entrusted with the charge of reasonable sheep, and who have
received this trust from the God of all, when we remember that the Lord
for them gave up His life? Who does not fear and tremble when he hears
the word of God spoken through Ezekiel? “I judge between shepherd and
sheep because ye eat the fat and clothe yourselves with the wool and ye
feed not the flocks.” <span id="fr_1740"></span>[1741](#fn_1740.md) And
again, “I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; when thou
speakest not to warn the wicked from his wicked way, the same wicked man
shall die in his iniquity but his blood shall I require at thine
hand.” <span id="fr_1741"></span>[1742](#fn_1741.md) With this agree the
words spoken in parables by the Lord. “Thou wicked and slothful
servant…Thou oughtest to have put my money to the exchangers, and then
at my coming I should have received the same with usury.” <span
id="fr_1742"></span>[1743](#fn_1742.md) Up then, I beseech you, let us
fight for the Lord’s sheep. Their Lord is near. He will certainly appear
and scatter the wolves and glorify the shepherds. “The Lord is good unto
them that wait for Him, to the soul that seeketh Him.” <span
id="fr_1743"></span>[1744](#fn_1743.md) Let us not murmur at the storm that
has arisen for the Lord of all knoweth what is good for us. Wherefore
also when the Apostle asked for release from his trials He would not
grant his supplication but said, “My grace is sufficient for thee, for
my strength is made perfect in weakness.” <span
id="fr_1744"></span>[1745](#fn_1744.md) Let us then bravely bear the evils
that befall us; it is in war that heroes are discerned; in conflicts
that athletes are crowned; in the surge of the sea that the art of the
helmsman is shewn; in the fire that the gold is tried. And let us not, I
beseech you, heed only ourselves, let us rather have forethought for the
rest, and that much more for the sick than for the whole, for it is an
apostolic precept which exclaims “Comfort the feeble minded, support the
weak.” <span id="fr_1745"></span>[1746](#fn_1745.md) Let us then stretch
out our hands to them that lie low, let us tend their wounds and set
them at their post to fight the devil. Nothing will so vex him as to see
them fighting and smiting again. Our Lord is full of loving-kindness. He
re<span id="page_275">p. 275</span> <span
id="iv.x.lxxviii-Page_275"></span>ceives the repentance of sinners. Let
us hear His own words: “As I live saith the Lord I have no pleasure in
the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and
live.” <span id="fr_1746"></span>[1747](#fn_1746.md) So He prefaced His
words with an oath, and He who forbids oaths to others swore Himself to
convince us how He desires our repentance and salvation. Of this
teaching the divine books, both the old and the new, are full, and the
precepts of the holy Fathers teach the same.

<span id="iv.x.lxxviii-p12"></span>But not as though you were ignorant
have I written to you; rather have I reminded you of what you know, like
those who standing safe upon the shore succour them that are tossed by
the storm, and shew them a rock, or give warning of a hidden shallow, or
catch and haul in a rope that has been thrown. “And the God of peace
shall bring Satan under your feet shortly” <span
id="fr_1747"></span>[1748](#fn_1747.md) and shall gladden our ears with
news that you have passed from storm to calm, at His word to the waves
“Peace be still.” <span id="fr_1748"></span>[1749](#fn_1748.md)

<span id="iv.x.lxxviii-p15"></span>And do you too offer prayers for us,
for you who have undergone peril for His sake can speak with greater
boldness. <span id="fr_1749"></span>[1750](#fn_1749.md)
