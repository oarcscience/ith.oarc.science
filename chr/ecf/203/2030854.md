<span id="vi.xiii.vi"></span>

<span id="vi.xiii.vi-p1"></span> 5. Now whereas we said that the Eastern
Churches, in their delivery of the Creed, say, “In one God <span
id="fr_3262"></span>[3263](#fn_3262) the Father Almighty,” and “in one
Lord,” the “one” is not to be understood numerically but absolutely. For
example, if one should say, “one man” or “one horse,” here “one” is used
numerically. For there may be a second man and a third, or a second
horse and a third. But where a second or a third cannot be added, if we
say “one” we mean one not numerically but absolutely. For example, if we
say, “one Sun,” here the meaning is that a second or a third cannot be
added, for there is but one <span id="page_545">p. 545</span> <span
id="vi.xiii.vi-Page_545"></span>Sun. Much more then is God, when He is
said to be “one,” called “one,” not numerically but absolutely, that is,
He is therefore said to be one because there is no other. In like
manner, also, it is to be understood of the Lord, that He is one Lord,
Jesus Christ, by or through Whom God the Father possesses dominion over
all, whence also, in the next clause, God is called “Almighty.”

<span id="vi.xiii.vi-p3"></span>God is called <span class="c14"><span
id="vi.xiii.vi-p3.1"></span>Almighty</span> because He possesses rule
and dominion over all things. <span id="fr_3263"></span>[3264](#fn_3263)
But the Father possesses all things by His Son, as the Apostle says, “By
Him were created all things, visible and invisible, whether they be
thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers.” <span
id="fr_3264"></span>[3265](#fn_3264) And again, writing to the Hebrews,
he says, “By Him also He made the worlds,” and “He appointed Him heir of
all things.” <span id="fr_3265"></span>[3266](#fn_3265) By “appointed”
we are to understand “generated.” Now if the Father made the worlds by
Him, and all things were created by Him, and He is heir of all things,
then by Him He possesses rule also over all things. Because, as light is
born of light, and truth of truth, so Almighty is born of Almighty. As
it is written of the Seraphim in the Revelation of John, “And they have
no rest day and night, crying Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God of Sabaoth,
which was and which is and which is to come, the Almighty.” <span
id="fr_3266"></span>[3267](#fn_3266) He then who “is to come” is called
“<span class="c14"><span id="vi.xiii.vi-p7.3"></span>Almighty</span>.”
And what other is there who “is to come” but Christ, the Son of God?

<span id="vi.xiii.vi-p8"></span>To the foregoing is added “<span
class="c14"><span id="vi.xiii.vi-p8.1"></span>Invisible and
Impassible</span>.” I should mention that these two words are not in the
Creed of the Roman Church. They were added in our Church, as is well
known, on account of the Sabellian heresy, called by us “the
Patripassian,” that, namely, which says that the Father Himself was born
of the Virgin and became visible, or affirms that He suffered in the
flesh. To exclude such impiety, therefore, concerning the Father, our
forefathers seem to have added these words, calling the Father
“invisible and impassible.” For it is evident that the Son, not the
Father, became incarnate and was born in the flesh, and that from that
nativity in the flesh the Son became “visible and passible.” Yet so far
as regards that immortal substance of the Godhead, which He possesses,
and which is one and the same with that of the Father, we must believe
that neither the Father, nor the Son, nor the Holy Ghost is “visible or
passible.” But the Son, in that He condescended to assume flesh, was
both seen and also suffered in the flesh. Which also the Prophet
foretold when he said, “This is our God: no other shall be accounted of
in comparison of Him. He hath found out all the way of knowledge, and
hath given it unto Jacob His servant and to Israel His beloved.
Afterward He shewed Himself upon the earth, and conversed with
men.” <span id="fr_3267"></span>[3268](#fn_3267)
