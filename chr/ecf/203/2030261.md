Assessor.* <span id="fr_1716"></span>[1717](#fn_1716.md)

<span id="iv.x.lxxii-p3"></span>At the time when men were whelmed in the
darkness of ignorance, all did not keep the same feasts, but celebrated
distinct ceremonies in different cities. In Ælis were the Olympian
games, at Delphi the Pythian, at Sparta the Hyacinthian, at Athens the
Panathenaic, the Thesmophoria, and the Dionysian. These were the most
remarkable, and further some men celebrated the revel feast of some
dæmons and some of others. But now that those mists have been scattered
by intellectual light, in every land and sea mainlanders and islanders
together keep the feast of our God and Saviour, and whithersoever any
one may wish to travel abroad, journey he either towards rising or
towards setting sun, everywhere he will find the same celebration
observed at the same time. There is no longer necessity, in obedience to
the law of Moses which was adapted to the infirmity of the Jews, to come
together into one city and keep the feast in memory of our blessings,
but every town, every village, the country and the farthest frontiers,
are filled with the grace of God, and in every spot divine shrines and
precincts are consecrated to the God of all. So through every town we
observe our several festivals and communicate with one another in the
feast. It is the same God and Lord who is honoured in our hymns and to
whom our mystic sacrifices are offered. On this account, as is well
known, we neighbours address one another by letter and signify the joy
that comes to us in the feast. So now do I to you and offer the festal
salutation to your excellency. You will without doubt reply and honour
the custom of the feast.
