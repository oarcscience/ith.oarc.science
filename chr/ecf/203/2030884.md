<span id="vi.xiii.xxxvi-p1"></span> 35. <span class="c14"><span
id="vi.xiii.xxxvi-p1.1"></span>And in the Holy Ghost</span>. What has
been delivered above somewhat at large concerning Christ relates to the
mystery of His Incarnation and of His Passion, and, by thus intervening,
as belonging to His Person, has somewhat delayed the mention of the Holy
Spirit. Otherwise, if the divine nature alone be taken into account, as
in the beginning of the Creed we say “I believe in God the Father
Almighty,” and afterwards, “In Jesus Christ His only Son our Lord,” so
in like manner we add, “And in the Holy Ghost.” But all of these
particulars which are spoken of above concerning Christ relate, as we
have said, to the dispensation of the flesh (to His Incarnation). By the
mention of the Holy Spirit, the mystery of the Trinity is completed. For
as one Father is mentioned, and there is no other Father, and one
only-begotten Son is mentioned, and there is no other only-begotten Son,
so also there is one Holy Ghost, and there cannot be another Holy Ghost.
In order, therefore, that the Persons may be distinguished, the terms
expressing relationship (the properties) are varied, whereby the first
is understood to be the Father, of Whom are all things, Who Himself also
hath no Father, the second the Son, as born of the Father, and the third
the Holy Ghost, as proceeding from both, <span

that in the Trinity one and the same Godhead may be set forth, since,
prefixing the preposition “in” we say that we believe “*in* God the
Father,” so also we say, “*in* Christ His Son,” so also “*in* the Holy
Ghost.” But our meaning will be made more plain in what follows. For the
Creed proceeds,—
