<span id="v.iii.xxxvii-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="v.iii.xxxvii-p2.1"></span>Irenæus</span>, <span
id="fr_2436"></span>[2437](#fn_2436.md) a presbyter under Pothinus the
bishop who ruled the church of Lyons in Gaul, being sent to Rome as
legate by the martyrs of this place, on account of certain
ecclesiastical questions, presented to Bishop Eleutherius certain
letters under his own name which are worthy of honour. Afterwards when
Pothinus, nearly ninety years of age, received the crown of martyrdom
for Christ, he was put in his place. It is certain too that he was a
disciple of Polycarp, the priest and martyr, whom we mentioned above. He
wrote five books *Against heresies* and a short volume, *Against the
nations* and another *On discipline,* a letter to Marcianus his brother
*On apostolical preaching,* a book of *Various treatises*; also to
Blastus, *On schism,* <span id="fr_2437"></span>[2438](#fn_2437.md) to
Florinus *On monarchy* or *That God is not the author of evil,* also an
excellent *Commentary on the Ogdoad* <span
id="fr_2438"></span>[2439](#fn_2438.md) at the end of which indicating that
he was near the apostolic period he wrote “I adjure thee whosoever shall
transcribe this book, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by his glorious
advent at which He shall judge the quick and the dead, that you
diligently compare, after you have transcribed, and amend it according
to the copy from which you have transcribed it and also that you shall
similarly transcribe this adjuration as you find it in your pattern.”
Other works of his are in circulation to wit: to Victor the Roman bishop
*On the Paschal controversy* in which he warns him not lightly to break
the unity of the fraternity, if indeed Victor believed that the many
bishops of Asia and the East, who with the Jews celebrated the passover,
on the fourteenth day of the new moon, were to be condemned. But even
those who differed from them did not support Victor in his opinion. He
flourished chiefly in the reign of the Emperor Commodus, who succeeded
Marcus Antoninus Verus in power.
