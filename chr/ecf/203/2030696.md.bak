another of the charges, if only he will confess under the stress of his
own consciousness of wrong that he has been convicted both of perjury
and of making a false defence. Otherwise, if he attempts to deny what I
say, I can produce as witnesses any number of my brethren, who, while
living in the cells built by me on the Mount of Olives, copied out for
him most of the Dialogues of Cicero. I often, as they wrote them out,
<span id="page_465">p. 465</span> <span
id="vi.xi.iii.xii-Page_465"></span>had in my hands quaternions <span
id="fr_2953"></span>[2954](#fn_2953.md) of these Dialogues; and I looked
them over myself, in recognition of the fact that he gave them much
larger pay than is usually given for writings of other sorts. He himself
also came to see me at Jerusalem from Bethlehem, bringing with him a
book which contained a single Dialogue of Cicero, and also one of
Plato’s in Greek; he will not pretend to deny having given me that book,
and having stayed some time with me. But what is the use of delaying so
long over a matter which is clearer than the light? To all that I have
said this addition is to be made, after which all further comment is
superfluous; that after he had settled in the monastery at Bethlehem,
and indeed not so long ago, he took the office of a teacher in grammar,
and explained ‘his own’ Maro and the comedians and lyrical and
historical writers to young boys who had been entrusted to him that he
might teach them the fear of the Lord: so that he actually became a
teacher and professor in the knowledge of those heathen authors, as to
whom he had sworn that if he even read them he would have denied Christ.

<span id="vi.xi.iii.xii-p2"></span> *Quaterniones* may mean ‘sets of
four.’ It likely to be used for a *‘cahier’* of four sheets.
