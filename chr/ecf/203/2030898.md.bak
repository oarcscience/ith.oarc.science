<span id="vi.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c21"><span
id="vi.xiv-p1.1"></span>The Preface to the Books of Recognitions of St.
Clement.</span>

<span id="vi.xiv-p2"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="vi.xiv-p2.1"></span>Addressed to Bishop Gaudentius.</span>

<span id="vi.xiv-p3"></span>(For the occasion and date <span
id="fr_3433"></span>[3434](#fn_3433.md) of this work see the Prolegomena,
p. 412.)

<span id="vi.xiv-p5"></span>————————————

<span id="vi.xiv-p6"></span>You possess so much vigour of character, my
dear Gaudentius, you who are so signal an ornament of our teachers, or
as I would rather say, you have the grace of the Spirit in so large a
measure, that even what you say in the way of daily conversation, or of
addresses that you preach in church, <span
id="fr_3434"></span>[3435](#fn_3434.md) ought to be consigned in writing
and handed down for the instruction of posterity. But I am far less
quick, my native talent being but slender, and old age is already making
me sluggish and slow; and this work is nothing but the payment of a debt
due to the command laid upon me by the virgin Sylvia whose memory I
revere. She it was who demanded of me, as you have now done by the right
of heirship, to translate Clement into our language. The debt is paid at
last, though after many delays. It is a part of the booty, and in my
opinion no small one, which I have carried off from the libraries of the
Greeks, and which I am collecting for the use and advantage of our
countrymen. I have no food of my own to bring them, and I must import
their nourishment from abroad. However, foreign goods are apt to appear
sweeter; and sometimes they are really more useful. Moreover, almost
anything which brings healing to our bodies or is a defence against
disease or an antidote to poison comes from abroad. Judæa sends us the
distillation of the balsam tree, Crete the leaf of the dictamnus, Arabia
her aromatic flowers, and India the crop of the spikenard. These goods
come to us, no doubt, in a less perfect condition than those which our
own fields produce, but they preserve intact their pleasant scent and
their healing power. Therefore, my friend who are as my own soul, I
present to you Clement returning to Rome. I present him dressed in a
Latin garb. Do not think it strange if the aspect which his eloquence
presents is less bright than it might be. It makes no difference if only
the meaning is felt to be the same.

<span id="vi.xiv-p8"></span>These are foreign wares, then, which I am
importing at a great expense of labour; and I have still to see whether
our countrymen will regard with gratitude one who is bringing them the
spoils (spolia) of his warfare, and who is unlocking with the key of our
language a treasure house hitherto concealed, though he does it with the
utmost good will. I only trust that God may look favourably on your good
wishes, so that my present may not be met in any quarter by evil eyes
and envious looks; and that we may not witness that extremely monstrous
phenomenon, expressions of illwill on the part of those on whom the gift
is conferred, while those from whom it is taken part with it
ungrudgingly. It is but right that you, who have read this work in the
Greek should point out to others the design of my translation—unless
indeed, you feel that in some respects I have not observed the right
method of rendering the original. You are, I believe well aware that
there are two Greek editions of this work of Clement, his Recognitions;
that there are two sets of books, which in some few cases differ from
each other though the bulk of the narrative is the same. For instance,
the last part of the work, that which gives an account of the
transformation of Simon Magus, exists in one of these, while in the
other it is entirely absent. On the other hand there are some things,
such as the dissertation on the unbegotten and the begotten God, and a
few others, which, though they are found in both editions, are, to say
<span id="page_564">p. 564</span> <span id="vi.xiv-Page_564"></span>the
least of them, beyond my understanding; and these I have preferred to
leave others to deal with rather than to present them in an inadequate
manner. As to the rest, I have taken pains not to swerve, even in the
slightest degree from either the sense or the diction; and this, though
it makes the expression less ornate, renders it more faithful.

<span id="vi.xiv-p9"></span>There is a letter in which this same Clement
writing to James the Lord’s brother, gives an account of the death of
Peter, and says that he has left him as his successor, as ruler and
teacher of the church; and further incorporates a whole scheme of
ecclesiastical government. This I have not prefixed to the work, both
because it is later in point of time, and because it has been previously
translated and published by me. Nevertheless, there is a point which
would perhaps seem inconsistent with facts were I to place the
translation of it in this work, but which I do not consider to involve
an impossibility. It is this. Linus and Cletus were Bishops of the city
of Rome before Clement. How then, some men ask, can Clement in his
letter to James say that Peter passed over to him his position as a
church-teacher. <span id="fr_3435"></span>[3436](#fn_3435.md) The
explanation of this point, as I understand, is as follows. Linus and
Cletus were, no doubt, Bishops in the city of Rome before Clement, but
this was in Peter’s life-time; that is, they took charge of the
episcopal work, while he discharged the duties of the apostolate. He is
known to have done the same thing at Cæsarea; for there, though he was
himself on the spot, yet he had at his side Zacchæus whom he had
ordained as Bishop. Thus we may see how both things may be true; namely
how they stand as predecessors of Clement in the list of Bishops, and
yet how Clement after the death of Peter became his successor in the
teacher’s chair. But it is time that we should pay attention to the
beginning of Clement’s own narrative, which he addresses to James the
Lord’s brother.
