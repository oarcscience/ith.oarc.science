<span id="iv.viii.i.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.i.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter I</span>.—*Origin of the Arian
Heresy.*

<span id="iv.viii.i.ii-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.i.ii-p2.1"></span>After</span> the overthrow of the wicked
and impious tyrants, Maxentius, Maximinus, and Licinius, the surge which
those destroyers, like hurricanes, had roused was hushed to sleep; the
whirlwinds were checked, and the Church henceforward began to enjoy a
settled calm. This was established for her by Constantine, a prince
deserving of all praise, whose calling, like that of the divine Apostle,
was not of men, nor by man, but from heaven. He enacted laws prohibiting
sacrifices to idols, and commanding churches <span
id="fr_237"></span>[238](#fn_237.md) to be erected. He appointed Christians
to be governors of the provinces, ordering honour to be shown to the
priests, and threatening with death those who dared to insult them. By
some the churches which had been destroyed were rebuilt; others erected
new ones still more spacious and magnificent. Hence, for us, all was joy
and gladness, while our enemies were overwhelmed with gloom and despair.
The temples of the idols were closed; but frequent assemblies were held,
and festivals celebrated, in the churches. But the devil, full of all
envy and wickedness, the destroyer of mankind, unable to bear the sight
of the Church sailing on with favourable winds, stirred up plans of evil
counsel, eager to sink the vessel steered by the Creator and Lord of the
Universe. When he began to perceive that the error of the Greeks had
been made manifest, that the various tricks of the demons had been
detected, and that the greater number of men worshipped the Creator,
instead of adoring, as heretofore, the creature, he did not dare to
declare open war against our God and Saviour; but having found some who,
though dignified with the name of Christians, <span id="page_34">p.
34</span> <span id="iv.viii.i.ii-Page_34"></span>were yet slaves to
ambition and vainglory, he made them fit instruments for the execution
of his designs, and by their means drew others back into their old
error, not indeed by the former method of setting up the worship of the
creature, but by bringing it about that the Creator and Maker of all
should be reduced to a level with the creature. I shall now proceed to
relate where and by what means he sowed these tares.

<span id="iv.viii.i.ii-p4"></span>Alexandria is an immense and populous
city, charged with the leadership not only of Egypt, but also of the
adjacent countries, the Thebaid and Libya. After Peter <span
id="fr_238"></span>[239](#fn_238.md) , the victorious champion of the
faith, had, during the sway of the aforesaid impious tyrants, obtained
the crown of martyrdom, the Church in Alexandria was ruled for a short
time by Achillas <span id="fr_239"></span>[240](#fn_239.md) . He was
succeeded by Alexander <span id="fr_240"></span>[241](#fn_240.md) , who
proved himself a noble defender of the doctrines of the gospel. At that
time, Arius, who had been enrolled in the list of the presbytery, and
entrusted with the exposition of the Holy Scriptures, fell a prey to the
assaults of jealousy, when he saw that the helm of the high priesthood
was committed to Alexander. Stung by this passion, he sought
opportunities for dispute and contention; and, although he perceived
that Alexander’s irreproachable conduct forbade his bringing any charges
against him, envy would not allow him to rest. In him the enemy of the
truth found an instrument whereby to stir and agitate the angry waters
of the Church, and persuaded him to oppose the apostolical doctrine of
Alexander. While the Patriarch, in obedience to the Holy Scriptures,
taught that the Son is of equal dignity with the Father, and of the same
substance with God who begat Him, Arius, in direct opposition to the
truth, affirmed that the Son of God is merely a creature or created
being, adding the famous dictum, “There once was a time when He was
not <span id="fr_241"></span>[242](#fn_241.md) ;” with other opinions which
may be learned from his own writings. He taught these false doctrines
perseveringly, not only in the church, but also in general meetings and
assemblies; and he even went from house to house, endeavouring to make
men the slaves of his error. Alexander, who was strongly attached to the
doctrines of the Apostles, at first tried by exhortations and counsels
to convince him of his error; but when he saw him playing the
madman <span id="fr_242"></span>[243](#fn_242.md) and making public
declaration of his impiety, he deposed him from the order of the
presbytery, for he heard the law of God loudly declaring, “*If thy right
eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee* <span
id="fr_243"></span>[244](#fn_243.md) .”
