party of Hydatius and Ithacius, and was put to death at Trèves by the
tyrant Maximus. He published many short writings, some of which have

Gnosticism, that is, with the heresy of Basilides or Mark, of whom
Irenæus writes, while his defenders maintain that he was not at all of
this way of thinking.
