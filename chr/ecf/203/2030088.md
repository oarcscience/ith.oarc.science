<span id="iv.viii.iii.v-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.iii.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V</span>.—*Of the fourth exile
and flight of the holy Athanasius*.

<span id="iv.viii.iii.v-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.iii.v-p2.1"></span>At</span> this time Athanasius, that
victorious athlete of the truth, underwent another peril, <span
id="page_98">p. 98</span> <span id="iv.viii.iii.v-Page_98"></span>for
the devils could not brook the power of his tongue and prayers, and so
armed their ministers to revile him. Many voices did they utter
beseeching the champion of wickedness to exile Athanasius, and adding
yet this further, that if Athanasius remained, not a heathen would
remain, for that he would get them all over to his side. Moved by these
supplications Julian condemned Athanasius not merely to exile, <span
id="fr_617"></span>[618](#fn_617) but to death. His people shuddered,
but it is related that he foretold the rapid dispersal of the storm, for
said he “It is a cloud which soon vanishes away.” He however withdrew as
soon as he learnt the arrival of the bearers of the imperial message,
and finding a boat on the bank of the river, started for the Thebaid.
The officer who had been appointed for his execution became acquainted
with his flight, and strove to pursue him at hot haste; one of his
friends, however, got ahead, and told him that the officer was coming on
apace. Then some of his companions besought him to take refuge in the
desert, but he ordered the steersman to turn the boat’s head to
Alexandria. So they rowed to meet the pursuer, and on came the bearer of
the sentence of execution, and, said he, “How far off is Athanasius?”
“Not far,” said Athanasius, <span id="fr_618"></span>[619](#fn_618) and
so got rid of his foe, while he himself returned to Alexandria and there
remained in concealment for the remainder of Julian’s reign. <span
id="fr_619"></span>[620](#fn_619)

<span id="iv.viii.iii.v-p3"></span> The crowning outrage which moved
Julian to put out the edict of exile was the baptism by the bishop of
some pagan ladies. The letter of Julian (Ep. p. 187) fixed Dec. 1st,
362, as the limit of Athanasius’ permission to stay in Egypt, but it was
on Oct. 23d (Fest. Ind.) that the order was communicated to him.

<span id="iv.viii.iii.v-p4"></span> The story may be compared with that
of Napoleon on the return from Elba in Feb. 1815, when on being hailed
by some passing craft with an enquiry as to the emperor’s health, he is
said to have himself taken the speaking trumpet and replied “Quite
well.”

<span id="iv.viii.iii.v-p5"></span> He concealed himself at Chœren, (?
El Careon) near Alexandria, and went thence to Memphis, whence he wrote
his Festal Letter for 363. Julian died June 26, 363.
