<span id="vi.xi.ii.xxvii"></span>

<span id="vi.xi.ii.xxvii-p1"></span> 26. So far he has set forth a
single exposition of the passage; but on whose authority he wishes us to
receive this interpretation he has not made clear. What he has done is
to make void this first interpretation by what comes after: for he goes
on: “But there is another, who tries to show that God is just.” He
therefore points out that by that first exposition the justice of God is
not vindicated, which of course is contrary to the faith: and he goes on
through the mouth of this ‘other,’ whose assertions he evidently wishes
to exhibit as being what is everywhere held for catholic and
indubitable, to give a testimony by which he will, as he asserts, seek
to show that God is just. Let us see then what this ‘other man’ says,
who proclaims the justice of God.

<span id="vi.xi.ii.xxvii-p2"></span>“Another man,” he says, “who seeks
to vindicate the justice of God, argues that it is not according to his
own pre-judgment and knowledge, but according to the merit of the elect
that God’s choice of men is determined; and he says that, before the
creation of the visible world, of sky and earth and seas and all that
they contain, there existed other invisible creatures, among which also
were souls; and that these souls, for reasons known to God alone, were
*cast down* <span id="fr_2865"></span>[2866](#fn_2865.md) into this vale of
tears, this place of our mournful pilgrimage, and that this is shewn by
the prayer uttered by a holy man of old who, having his habitation fixed
here, yet longed to return to his original abode: “Woe is me that my
sojourning is prolonged, that I have my habitation among the inhabitants
of <span id="page_449">p. 449</span> <span
id="vi.xi.ii.xxvii-Page_449"></span>Kedar,” <span
id="fr_2866"></span>[2867](#fn_2866.md) “my soul has long been a pilgrim,”
and again “O wretched man that I am, who will deliver me from the body
of this death?” <span id="fr_2867"></span>[2868](#fn_2867.md) and in
another place “It is better to return and be with Christ,” <span
id="fr_2868"></span>[2869](#fn_2868.md) and elsewhere, “Before I was
brought low, I sinned;” <span id="fr_2869"></span>[2870](#fn_2869.md) and
other words of a like character.”

<span id="vi.xi.ii.xxvii-p8"></span>This relates, they say to the souls’
condition before they were *cast down* into the world. The reader of
this will be apt to say, Master, you seem to tell us, yet do not really
tell us, who these men are who say this, that the souls of men existed
before they were cast down into the world. Then he will reply, “Was I
not right in saying that you were blind, and no better than a mole? Did
I not say before, that they are those who assert that God is just,—by
which, if you had any sense at all, you would understand that I mean
myself: for I am not such a heretic as not to include myself among those
who vindicate the justice of God, which indeed all must do who have the
least tincture of good sense.” Then they will reply, “Tell us, then,
master, tell us, what it is that these men say, and you among them? We
understand that you say that before the souls were cast down into the
world, and before the world, which was made up of souls, had been cast
down together with its inhabitants into the abyss, God chose Paul and
those like him, who were holy and undefiled. But if men are chosen, they
are chosen out of a great number; there must be many in a worse
condition out of whom the election is made. However, just as in the
Babylonian captivity, when Nebuchadnezzar carried away the people into
Chaldæa, Ezekiel and Daniel and the Three Children, and Haggai and
Zechariah were sent with them, not because they deserved to become
captives, but that they might be a comfort to those who were carried
away; so also, in that ‘casting down’ of the world, those who had been
chosen by God before the world was, were sent to instruct and train the
sinful souls, so that these, through their preaching, might return to
the place from which they had fallen; and this is what is meant by the
words of the eighty-ninth Psalm: <span
id="fr_2870"></span>[2871](#fn_2870.md) “Lord thou hast been our refuge in
generation and in offspring, before the mountains were established, or
the earth and the world were made;” that is to say, that before the
world was made, and a beginning was made of the generation of all
things, God was a refuge to his saints.”
