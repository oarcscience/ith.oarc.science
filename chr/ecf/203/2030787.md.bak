<span id="vi.xii.ii.xv-p1"></span> 14. The next passage in this apology
is as follows:

<span id="vi.xii.ii.xv-p2"></span>“I am neither a champion nor a
defender of Origen, nor am I the first who has translated his works.
Others before me have done the same thing: and I did it, the last of
many, at the request of my brethren. If an order is to be given that
such translations are not to be made, such an order holds good for the
future, not the past: but if those are to be blamed who have made these
translations before any such order was given, the blame must begin with
those who took the first step.”

<span id="vi.xii.ii.xv-p3"></span>Here at last he has vomited forth what
he wanted to say, and all his inflamed mind has broken out into this
malicious accusation against me. When he translates the <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xii.ii.xv-p3.1"></span>Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν</span> he
declares that he is following me. When he is accused for having done it,
he gives me as his example: whether he is in danger or out of danger, he
cannot live without me. Let me tell him, therefore, what he professes
not to know. No one reproaches you because you translated Origen,
otherwise Hilary and Ambrose would be condemned: but because you
translated a heretical work, and tried to gain support for it by
praising me in the Preface. I myself, whom you criminate, translated
seventy homilies of Origen, and parts of his Tomes, in order that by
translating his best works I might withdraw the worst from notice: and I
also have openly translated the <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xii.ii.xv-p3.2"></span>Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν</span> to prove the falsity of
your translation, so as to show the reader what to avoid. If you wish to
translate Origen into Latin, you have at hand many <span
id="page_509">p. 509</span> <span
id="vi.xii.ii.xv-Page_509"></span>homilies and Tomes of his, in which
some topic of morality is handled or some obscure passage of Scripture
is opened. Translate these; give these to those who ask them of you. Why
should your first labour begin with what is infamous? And why, when you
were about to translate a heretical work, did you preface and support it
by the supposed book of a martyr, and force upon the ears of Romans a
book the translation of which threw the world into panic? At all events,
if you translate such a work with the view of exhibiting the author as a
heretic, change nothing from the Greek text, and make this clear in the
Preface. It is this which the Pope Anastasius most wisely embodies in
the letter which he has addressed to the Bishop John against you; he
frees me who have done this from all blame, but condemns you who would
not do it. You will perhaps deny the existence of this letter; I have
therefore subjoined a copy of it; so that, if you will not listen to
your brother when he advises, you may listen to the Bishop when he
condemns.

[Next: You pretend not to be Origen's defender, but you publish and
enlarge the Apology for him and allege the heretics' falsification of
his works.](2030788.md)
