<span id="v.iii.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="v.iii.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter V.</span>

<span id="v.iii.vii-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="v.iii.vii-p2.1"></span>Paul</span>, <span
id="fr_2354"></span>[2355](#fn_2354) formerly called Saul, an apostle
outside the number of the twelve apostles, was of the tribe of Benjamin
and the town of Giscalis <span id="fr_2355"></span>[2356](#fn_2355) in
Judea. When this was taken by the Romans he removed with his parents to
Tarsus in Cilicia. Sent by them to Jerusalem to study law he was
educated by Gamaliel a most learned man whom Luke mentions. But after he
had been present at the death of the martyr Stephen and had received
letters from the high priest of the temple for the persecution of those
who believed in Christ, he proceeded to Damascus, where constrained to
faith by a revelation, as it is written in the Acts of the apostles, he
was transformed from a persecutor into an elect vessel. As Sergius
Paulus Proconsul of Cyprus was the first to believe on his preaching, he
took his name from him because he had subdued him to faith in Christ,
and having been joined by Barnabas, after traversing many cities, he
returned to Jerusalem and was ordained apostle to the Gentiles by Peter,
James and John. And because a full account of his life is given in the
Acts of the Apostles, I only say this, that the twenty-fifth year after
our Lord’s passion, that is the second of Nero, at the time when Festus
Procurator of Judea succeeded Felix, he was sent bound to Rome, and
remaining for two years in free custody, disputed daily with the Jews
<span id="page_363">p. 363</span> <span
id="v.iii.vii-Page_363"></span>concerning the advent of Christ. It ought
to be said that at the first defence, the power of Nero having not yet
been confirmed, nor his wickedness broken forth to such a degree as the
histories relate concerning him, Paul was dismissed by Nero, that the
gospel of Christ might be preached also in the West. As he himself
writes in the second epistle to Timothy, at the time when he was about
to be put to death dictating his epistle as he did while in chains; “At
my first defence no one took my part, but all forsook me: may it not be
laid to their account. But the Lord stood by <span
id="fr_2356"></span>[2357](#fn_2356) me and strengthened me; that
through me the message might be fully proclaimed and that all the
Gentiles might hear, and I was delivered out of the mouth of the
lion” <span id="fr_2357"></span>[2358](#fn_2357) —clearly indicating
Nero as lion on account of his cruelty. And directly following he says
“The Lord delivered me from the mouth of the lion” and again shortly
“The Lord delivered me <span id="fr_2358"></span>[2359](#fn_2358) from
every evil work and saved me unto his heavenly kingdom,” <span
id="fr_2359"></span>[2360](#fn_2359) for indeed he felt within himself
that his martyrdom was near at hand, for in the same epistle he
announced “for I am already being offered and the time of my departure
is at hand.” <span id="fr_2360"></span>[2361](#fn_2360) He then, in the
fourteenth year of Nero on the same day with Peter, was beheaded at Rome
for Christ’s sake and was buried in the Ostian way, the twenty-seventh
year after our Lord’s passion. He wrote nine epistles to seven churches:
*To the Romans* one, *To the Corinthians* two, *To the Galatians* one,
*To the Ephesians* one, *To the Philippians* one, *To the Colossians*
one, *To the Thessalonians* two; and besides these to his disciples, *To
Timothy* two, *To Titus* one, *To Philemon* one. The epistle which is
called the *Epistle to the Hebrews* is not considered his, on account of
its difference from the others in style and language, but it is
reckoned, either according to Tertullian to be the work of Barnabas, or
according to others, to be by Luke the Evangelist or Clement afterwards
bishop of the church at Rome, who, they say, arranged and adorned the
ideas of Paul in his own language, though to be sure, since Paul was
writing to Hebrews and was in disrepute among them he may have omitted
his name from the salutation on this account. He being a Hebrew wrote
Hebrew, that is his own tongue and most fluently while the things which
were eloquently written in Hebrew were more eloquently turned into
Greek <span id="fr_2361"></span>[2362](#fn_2361) and this is the reason
why it seems to differ from other epistles of Paul. Some read one also
to <span id="fr_2362"></span>[2363](#fn_2362) the Laodiceans but it is
rejected by everyone.
