<span id="iv.x.vii-p1"></span> *VII. To Theonilla.*

<span id="iv.x.vii-p2"></span>Had I heard of the death of your dignity’s
most honourable husband I should have written long ago, and now my
object in writing is not to lull your great sorrow to sleep by
consolatory words. They are unnecessary. They who have learnt the wisdom
of philosophers and consider what this life is, find reason strong
enough to meet and break grief’s rising surge. And even while you are
remembering your long companionship, reason recognises the divine
decrees, and to meet the forces of the tears of sorrow marshals at once
the course of nature, the law of God, and the hope of the resurrection.
Knowing this as I do, there is no necessity to use many words. I only
beseech you to avail yourself of good sense in the hour of need. Think
of the death of him who is gone as no more than a long journey, and wait
for the promise of our God and Saviour. For He who promised the
resurrection cannot lie, and is the fount of truth.
