<span id="iv.viii.i.xix-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.i.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVIII</span>.—*The Unlawful
Translation of Eusebius, Bishop of Nicomedia*.

<span id="iv.viii.i.xix-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.i.xix-p2.1"></span>The</span> Arian party did not desist
from their evil machinations. They had only signed the confession of
faith for the purpose of disguising themselves in sheeps’-skins, while
they were acting the part of wolves. The holy Alexander, of Byzantium,
for the city was not yet called Constantinople, who by his prayer had
pierced Arius to the heart, had, at the period to which we are
referring, been translated to a better life. Eusebius, the propagator of
impiety, little regarding the definition which, only a short time
previously, he with the other bishops had agreed upon, without delay
quitted Nicomedia and seized upon the see of Constantinople, in direct
violation of that canon <span id="fr_403"></span>[404](#fn_403.md) which
prohibits bishops and presbyters from being translated from one city to
another. But that those who carry their infatuation so far as to deny
the divinity of the only-begotten Son of God, should likewise violate
the other laws, cannot excite surprise. Nor was this the first occasion
<span id="page_56">p. 56</span> <span
id="iv.viii.i.xix-Page_56"></span>that he made this innovation; for,
having been originally entrusted with the see of Berytus, he leapt from
thence to Nicomedia. Whence he was expelled by the synod, on account of
his manifest impiety, as was likewise Theognis, bishop of Nicæa. This is
related a second time in the letters of the emperor Constantine; and I
shall here insert the close of the letter which he wrote to the
Nicomedians.
