<span id="iv.viii.iv.xxx-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.iv.xxx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXX</span>.—*Of the bold
utterance of Trajanus the general*.

<span id="iv.viii.iv.xxx-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.iv.xxx-p2.1"></span>After</span> Valens had crossed the
Bosphorus and come into Thrace he first spent a considerable time at
Constantinople, in alarm as to the issue of the war. He had sent
Trajanus in command of troops against the barbarians. When the general
came back beaten, the emperor reviled him sadly, and charged him with
infirmity and cowardice. Boldly, as became a brave man, Trajanus
replied: “I have not been beaten, sir, it is thou who hast abandoned the
victory by fighting against God and transferring His support to the
barbarians. Attacked by thee He is taking their side, for victory is on
God’s side and comes to them whom God leads. Dost thou not know,” he
went on, “whom thou hast expelled from their churches and to whose
government these churches have been delivered by thee?” Arintheus and
Victor, <span id="fr_801"></span>[802](#fn_801.md) generals like Trajanus,
confirmed the truth of what he said, and implored the emperor not to be
angered by reproaches which were founded upon fact. <span

<span id="iv.viii.iv.xxx-p4"></span> Gibbon (chap. xxvi) records the
conduct of the war by “Trajan and Profuturus, two generals who indulged
themselves in a very false and favourable opinion of their own
abilities.” “Anhelantes altius. sed imbelles.” Amm.

<span id="iv.viii.iv.xxx-p5"></span>The battle alluded to is presumably
the doubtful one of Salices. Ammianus does not, as Gibbon supposes,
imply that he had himself visited this particular battlefield, but
speaks generally of carrion birds as “adsuetæ illo tempore cadaveribus
pasci, *ut indicant nunc usque albentes ossibus campi.*” Amm. xxxi. 7.
