<span id="iv.viii.v.xxxi-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.v.xxxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXI.—</span>*Of his care for
the Scythians and his zeal against the Marcionists*

<span id="iv.viii.v.xxxi-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.v.xxxi-p2.1"></span>On</span> learning that some of the
Nomads encamped along the Danube were thirsty for salvation, but had
none to bring them the stream, John sought out men who were filled with
a love of labour like that which had distinguished the apostles, and
gave them charge of the work. I have myself seen a letter written by him
to Leontius, bishop of Ancyra, in which he described the conversion of
the Scythians, and begged that fit men for their instruction might be
sent.

<span id="iv.viii.v.xxxi-p3"></span>On hearing that in our
district <span id="fr_918"></span>[919](#fn_918.md) some men were infected
with the plague of Marcion he wrote to the then bishop charging him to
drive out the plague, and proffering him the aid of the imperial edicts.
I have said enough to show how, to use the words of the divine apostle,
he carried in his heart “the care of all the churches.” <span
id="fr_919"></span>[920](#fn_919.md)

<span id="iv.viii.v.xxxi-p6"></span>His boldness may also be learnt from
other sources.
