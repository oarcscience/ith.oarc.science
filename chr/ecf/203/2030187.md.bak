<span id="iv.ix.v.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c57"><span
id="iv.ix.v.ii-p1.1"></span>Proofs that the Union was without
Confusion.</span>

<span id="iv.ix.v.ii-p2"></span>1. Those who believe that after the
union there was one nature both of Godhead and of manhood, destroy by
this reasoning the peculiarities of the natures; and their destruction
involves denial of either nature. For the confusion of the united
natures prevents us from recognising either that flesh is flesh or that
God is God. But if even after the union the difference of the united
natures is clear, it follows that there is no confusion and that the
union is without confusion. And if this is confessed then the Master
Christ is not one nature, but one Son shewing either nature unimpaired.

<span id="iv.ix.v.ii-p3"></span>2. We too assert the union, and
ourselves confess that it took place at the conception; if then by the
union the natures were mixed and confounded, how was the flesh after the
birth not seen to possess any new quality, but exhibited the human
character, preserved the dimensions of the babe, was wrapped in
swaddling clothes, and sucked a mother’s breast? And if all this did not
come to pass in mere phantasy and seeming, then they admit of neither
phantasy nor seeming; then what was seen was truly a body. And if this
be granted then the natures were not confounded by the union, but each
remained unimpaired.

<span id="iv.ix.v.ii-p4"></span>3. The authors of this patchwork and
incongruous heresy at one time assert that God the Word was made flesh,
and at another declare that the flesh underwent a change into nature of
Godhead. Either statement is futile and vain and full of falsehood, for
if God the Word, as they argue, was made flesh, why then do they call
Him God, and this alone, and refuse to name Him man as well, and find
great fault with us who in addition to confessing Him as God also call
Him man? But if the flesh was changed into the nature of Godhead,
wherefore do they substitute the antitypes of the body? For the type is
superfluous when the reality is destroyed.

<span id="iv.ix.v.ii-p5"></span>4. An incorporeal nature is not
corporeally circumcised, but the word corporeally is added on account of
the spiritual circumcision of the heart; so then the circumcision is of
a body; but the Master Christ is circumcised after the union. And if
this is granted then the argument of the confusion is confuted.

<span id="iv.ix.v.ii-p6"></span><span id="page_247">p. 247</span> <span
id="iv.ix.v.ii-Page_247"></span>5. We have learnt that the Saviour
Christ hungered and thirsted, and we have believed that this was so
really and not in seeming, but such conditions belong not to a bodiless
nature but to a body. The Master Christ then had a body which before the
resurrection was affected according to its nature. And to this the
divine Apostle bears testimony when he says “For we have not an High
Priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but
was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin.” <span
id="fr_1584"></span>[1585](#fn_1584.md) For the sin is not of the nature
but of the evil will. <span id="fr_1585"></span>[1586](#fn_1585.md)

<span id="iv.ix.v.ii-p9"></span>6. Of the divine nature the prophet
David says, “Behold He that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor
sleep.” <span id="fr_1586"></span>[1587](#fn_1586.md) But the narrative of
the Evangelist describes the Master Christ as sleeping in the boat. Now
not sleeping and being asleep are two contrary ideas, so the prophet
contradicts the Gospels if, as they argue, the Master Christ was God
alone. There is no contradiction, for both prophecies and gospels flow
from one and the same spirit. The Master Christ therefore had a body,
akin to all other bodies, affected by the need of sleep. So the argument
for the confusion is proved a fable.

<span id="iv.ix.v.ii-p11"></span>7. Of the divine nature the prophet
Isaiah said, “He shall neither be hungry nor weary” <span
id="fr_1587"></span>[1588](#fn_1587.md) and so on. But the Evangelist says
“Jesus being weary with his journey sat thus on the well;” <span
id="fr_1588"></span>[1589](#fn_1588.md) and “shall not be weary” is
contrary to “being weary.” Therefore the prophecy is contrary to the
narrative of the gospels. But they are not contrary, for both are of one
God. Not being weary is of the uncircumscribed nature which fills all
things. But moving from place to place is of the circumscribed nature;
and when that which moves is constrained to travel it is subject to the
weariness of the wayfarer. Therefore what walked and was weary was a
body, for the union did not confound the natures.

<span id="iv.ix.v.ii-p14"></span>8. To the divine Paul when shut up in
prison the Master Christ said “Be not afraid Paul” <span
id="fr_1589"></span>[1590](#fn_1589.md) and so on. But the same Christ, who
drove away Paul’s fear, Himself so feared, as testifies the blessed Luke
that He sweated from all His body drops of blood, and with them
sprinkled all the ground about His body, and was strengthened by angelic
succour, <span id="fr_1590"></span>[1591](#fn_1590.md) and these statements
are opposed to one another, for how can fearing be other than contrary
to driving away fear? Yet they are not contrary. For the same Christ is
by nature God and man; as God He strengthens them that need consolation;
as man He receives consolation through an angel. And although the
Godhead and the Spirit were present as an anointing, the body and the
soul were not then supported either by the Godhead united to them or by
the Holy Ghost, but this service was entrusted to an angel in order to
exhibit the infirmity both of the soul and of the body and that through
the infirmity might be seen the natures of the infirm. Now these things
plainly happened by the permission of the divine nature, that, among
them that were to live in future times, believers in the assumption of
the soul and of the body might be vindicated by these demonstrations,
and their opponents by plain proof convicted. If then the union was
effected by the conception, and, as they argue, made both natures one,
how could the properties of the natures continue unimpaired, the soul
agonize, and the body sweat so as to sweat bloody drops from excess of
fear? But if the one is natural to the body and the other to the soul,
then the union did not effect one nature of flesh and Godhead, but one
Son appeared shewing forth in Himself both the human and the divine.

<span id="iv.ix.v.ii-p17"></span>9. Should they say that after the
resurrection the body underwent mutation into Godhead they may properly
be answered thus. Even after the resurrection the body was seen
circumscribed with hands and feet and all the body’s parts; it was
tangible and visible; it had wounds and scars, as it had before the
resurrection. One then of two alternatives must be maintained. Either
these parts must be attributed to the divine nature, if the body when
changed into the divine nature had these parts; or on the other hand it
must be confessed that the body remained within the bounds of its own
nature. Now the divine nature is simple and incomposite, but the body is
composite and divided into many parts; therefore it was not changed into
the nature of Godhead, but even after the resurrection though immortal,
incorruptible and full of divine glory, it remains a body with its own
circumscription.

<span id="iv.ix.v.ii-p18"></span>10. To the unbelieving apostles the
Lord after His resurrection shewed His hands, His feet, and the prints
of the nails; then further to teach them that what they saw was not a
vision He added “a spirit hath not flesh and bones as ye see me
have.” <span id="fr_1591"></span>[1592](#fn_1591.md) <span id="page_248">p.
248</span> <span id="iv.ix.v.ii-Page_248"></span>Therefore the body was
not changed into spirit it was flesh and bones and hands and feet.
Consequently even after the resurrection the body remained a body.

<span id="iv.ix.v.ii-p20"></span>11. The divine nature is invisible, but
the thrice blessed Stephen said that he saw the Lord, <span
id="fr_1592"></span>[1593](#fn_1592.md) so even after the resurrection the
Lord’s body is a body, and it was seen by the victorious Stephen, since
the divine nature cannot be seen.

<span id="iv.ix.v.ii-p22"></span>12. If all mankind shall see the Son of
man coming on the clouds of heaven, according to the Lord’s own
words, <span id="fr_1593"></span>[1594](#fn_1593.md) and He said to Moses
“No man shall see me and live,” <span
id="fr_1594"></span>[1595](#fn_1594.md) and both are true, then He will
come with the body with which He ascended into heaven. For that body is
visible, and of this the angel spoke to the Apostles “This same Jesus
which is taken up from you into Heaven shall so come in like manner as
ye have seen Him go into Heaven.” <span
id="fr_1595"></span>[1596](#fn_1595.md) If this is true, as true it is,
then there is not one nature of flesh and Godhead, but the union is
without confusion.
