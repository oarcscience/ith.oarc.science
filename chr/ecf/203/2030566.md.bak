id="fr_2651"></span>[2652](#fn_2651.md) </span> the bishop, a man of
vigorous character, learned in the Divine Scriptures, and proficient
both in Greek and Latin, was, before he disclosed his participation in
the ungodliness of Pelagius, distinguished among the doctors of the
church. But afterwards, trying to defend the Pelagian heresy, he wrote
four books, *Against Augustine,* the opponent of Pelagius, and then
again, eight books more. There is also a book containing a discussion,
where each defends his side.

<span id="v.iv.xlvii-p4"></span>This Julianus, in time of famine and
want, attracting many through the alms which he gave, and the glamour of
virtue, which they cast around him, associated them with him in his
heresy. He died during the reign of Valentinianus, the son of
Constantius.
