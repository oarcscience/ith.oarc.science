id="fr_2409"></span>[2410](#fn_2409.md) the pupil of John, bishop of
Hierapolis in Asia, wrote only five volumes, which he entitled
*Exposition of the words of our Lord,* in which, when he had asserted in
his preface that he did not follow various opinions but had the apostles
for authority, he said “I considered what Andrew and Peter said, what
Philip, what Thomas, what James, what John, <span
id="fr_2410"></span>[2411](#fn_2410.md) what Matthew or any one else among
the disciples of our Lord, what also Aristion and the elder John,
disciples of the Lord had said, not so much that I have their books to
read, as that their living voice is heard until the present day in the
authors themselves.” It appears through this catalogue of names that the
John who is placed among the disciples is not the same as the elder John
whom he places after Aristion in his enumeration. This we say moreover
because of the opinion mentioned above, where we record that it is
declared by many that the last two epistles of John are the work not of
the apostle but of the presbyter.

<span id="v.iii.xx-p5"></span>He is said to have published a *Second
coming of Our Lord or Millennium.* Irenæus and Apollinaris and others
who say that after the resurrection the Lord will reign in the flesh
with the saints, follow him. Tertullian also in his work *On the hope of
the faithful,* Victorinus of Petau and Lactantius follow this view.
