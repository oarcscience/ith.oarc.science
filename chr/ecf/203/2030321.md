<span id="iv.x.cxxxii-p1"></span> *CXXXI. To Longinus, Archimandrite of
Doliche.* <span id="fr_1953"></span>[1954](#fn_1953)

<span id="iv.x.cxxxii-p3"></span>You have shewn alike your zeal for the
true religion, and your love for your neighbour, both of which are at
the present time clearly connected, for it is for the sake of the
apostolic decrees that I am being attacked, because I refuse to give up
the heritage of my fathers, and prefer to undergo any suffering to
looking lightly on the robbery of one tittle from the faith of the
Gospel. You have accepted fellowship in my sufferings, not only by
comforting me by means of your letter, but further by sending to me the
very honourable and pious Matthew and Isaac. You shall hear, I am well
assured, from the lips of the righteous Lord, “I was in prison, and ye
visited me.” <span id="fr_1954"></span>[1955](#fn_1954) We are small and
of no account, and burdened by a great load of sins, but the Lord is
bountiful and generous. He remembers the small rather than the great,
and says, “Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of
these” <span id="fr_1955"></span>[1956](#fn_1955) “which believe in
me” <span id="fr_1956"></span>[1957](#fn_1956) “ye have done it unto
me.” <span id="fr_1957"></span>[1958](#fn_1957) I pray you in that you
are conspicuous for right doctrine, and shine by worthiness of life, and
therefore have great boldness before God, help me in your prayers, that
I may be able “to stand,” to use the words of the Apostle, <span
id="fr_1958"></span>[1959](#fn_1958) “against the wiles of error,”
escape the sins of the destroyer, and stand, though with little
boldness, in the day of the appearing before the righteous Judge.

id="iv.x.cxxxii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.x.cxxxii-p2"></span> Sent presumably at the same time as
the preceding. Nothing is recorded of Longinus. It will be remembered
that the name, recorded also in the Acts of Linus as that of an officer
commanding the executioners of St. Paul, is assigned by tradition to the
soldier who wounded the Saviour’s side.

and vi. 11. As in the case of the former citation Theodoret seems to be
quoting from memory, and coupling the two passages in which the word
<span class="Greek"><span id="iv.x.cxxxii-p8.3"></span>μεθοδεία</span>
occurs. “Wiles” fits in better with the evident allusion to <span
id="iv.x.cxxxii-p8.4"></span>[Eph. vi.
11](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#011)<span id="iv.x.cxxxii-p8.5"></span>,
than the periphrasis by which A.V. renders [Eph.
4.14](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#014)<span
id="iv.x.cxxxii-p8.6"></span>, and for which the revisers substitute
“the wiles of error.” “<span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.x.cxxxii-p8.7"></span>μεθοδεία</span>” may be exactly described
as “<span class="Greek"><span id="iv.x.cxxxii-p8.8"></span>ἡ</span>
<span class="Greek"><span id="iv.x.cxxxii-p8.9"></span>ἀποστολικὴ
φωνή</span>,” for it occurs nowhere but in these two passages.
