<span id="iv.x.xxxiv-p1"></span> *XXXIV. To the Count Patricius.*

<span id="iv.x.xxxiv-p2"></span>All kinds of goodness are praiseworthy,
but all are made more beautiful by loving kindness. For it we earnestly
pray the God of all; through it alone we obtain forgiveness when we err;
it makes wealth stoop to the poor, and because I know that your
Excellency is richly endowed with it I confidently commend to you the
admirable and excellent Celestinianus, once lord of vast wealth and
possessions and suddenly stripped of all, but bearing his poverty as
easily as few men bear their riches. The subject of the tragedy
involving the fall of his fortunes is the barbarian invasion of Libya
and Carthage. I have introduced him to your greatness; pray suggest his
case to others, and move them to pity. You will win <span

id="iv.x.xxxiv-Page_262"></span>greater gain by giving many a lesson in
loving kindness:
