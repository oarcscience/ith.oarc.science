<span id="vi.xii.iii.xxxi-p1"></span> 30. Your Apology says that there
are three opinions as to the origin of souls: one held by Origen, a
second by Tertullian and Lactantius (as to Lactantius what you say is
manifestly false), a third by us simple and foolish men, who do not see
that, if our opinion is true, God is thereby shewn to be unjust. After
this you say that you do not know what is the truth. I say, then, tell
me, whether you think that outside of these three opinions any truth can
be found so that all these three may be false; or whether you think one
of these three is true. If there is some other possibility, why do you
confine the liberty of discussion within a close-drawn line? and why do
you put forward the views which are false and keep silence about the
true? But if one of the three is true and the two others false, why do
you include false and true in one assertion of ignorance? Perhaps you
pretend not to know which is true in order that it may be safe for you,
whenever you may please, to defend the false. This is the smoke, these
are the mists, with which you try to keep away the light from men’s
eyes. You are the Aristippus <span id="fr_3190"></span>[3191](#fn_3190.md)
of our day: you bring your ship into the port of Rome full of
merchandize of all kinds; you set your professorial chair on high, and
represent to us Hermagoras <span id="fr_3191"></span>[3192](#fn_3191.md)
and Gorgias <span id="fr_3192"></span>[3193](#fn_3192.md) of Leontinum:
only, you were in such a hurry to set sail that you left one little
piece of goods, one little question, forgotten in the East. And you cry
out with reiteration that you learned both at Aquileia and at Alexandria
that God is the creator of both our bodies and our souls. This then,
forsooth, is the pressing question, whether our souls were created by
God or by the devil, and not whether the opinion of Origen is true that
our souls existed before our bodies and committed some sin because of
which they have been tied to these gross bodies; or whether, again, they
slept like dormice in a state of torpor and of slumber. Every one is
asking this question, but you say nothing about it; nobody asks the
other, but to that you direct your answer.

[Next: My ignorance of many natural phenomena is no excuse for your
ignorance as to the origin of souls. You ought, according to your
boasting dream to know everything. The thing of most importance was
forgotten in your cargo of Eastern wares.](2030834.md)
