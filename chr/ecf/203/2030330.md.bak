<span id="iv.x.cxli-p1"></span> *CXL. To the Master Vincomalus.* <span
id="fr_1985"></span>[1986](#fn_1985.md)

<span id="iv.x.cxli-p3"></span>I have been much astonished to learn that
your magnificence, though quite unacquainted with me and mine, and
knowing only the wrong that had been done me, stood up as my advocate,
and left no means untried to undo the results of the conspiracy against
me. But your excellency will assuredly receive recompense from our
bountiful Lord, for He who promised to give a reward for a little water
will doubtless give greater recompense to the givers of greater gifts.

<span id="iv.x.cxli-p4"></span>I have indeed endured such sufferings as
none, or at least very few, of the ancients have undergone, and this not
only from my open foes, but, as I apprehend, from my real friends. The
former attacked me, the latter betrayed me.

<span id="iv.x.cxli-p5"></span>Who in the world ever heard of such a
trial? Who ever commanded a criminal to be tried in his absence after
chaining him up at a distance of more than five and thirty stages? What
judge has ever been so savage and inhuman as not only to try men, aye
but to condemn men the sound of whose voice he has never heard, and this
in most savage and inhuman fashion? The Lord has ordered the erring
brother, who spurns advice, after a first, second and third admonition,
to be treated as “an heathen man and a publican.” <span
id="fr_1986"></span>[1987](#fn_1986.md) Now these most equitable and
righteous judges have not even given to them of the same faith with
themselves the treatment which they give to heathen men and publicans.
These indeed they do see and occasionally converse with, and that with
all honour and deference where they appear to be of rank and dignity.
But they have ordered me to be cut off from home, from water, from
everything. This is the way in which they have wished to become
imitators of our Father in heaven “Who maketh His sun to rise on the
evil and on the good <span id="page_309">p. 309</span> <span
id="iv.x.cxli-Page_309"></span>and sendeth rain on the just and on the
unjust.” <span id="fr_1987"></span>[1988](#fn_1987.md) But of these men I
will say no more. The tribunal of the Lord is at hand where is required
not stage pretence but the reality of life. Now I beseech your
excellency to express my thanks to the emperor, the lover of Christ and
victorious, and to the very pious and godly Augusta, for having made
true religion the firm root of their pious empire, and to implore their
majesties to make the peace of the churches firm by commanding the
assembling of a council, not of men of violence who throw the discussion
into confusion, but of the lovers of the truth who confirm the apostolic
teaching, and repudiate this new fangled and spurious heresy. And I pray
that of these honourable endeavours you may reap the fruit at the hands
of our loving Lord.

<span id="iv.x.cxli-p2"></span> The internal evidence of the letter
makes it synchronize with the preceding. The advocacy of the cause of
Theodoretus by Vincomalus is the more striking in that it does not
appear to have been suggested by personal friendship. Vincomalus was
Consul Designate in 452. (Dict. Christ. Biog. iv. 1159. Labbe iv. 843.)
