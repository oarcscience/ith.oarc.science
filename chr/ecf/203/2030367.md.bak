<span id="iv.x.clxxviii-p1"></span> *CLXXVII. Letter to Andreas, Bishop
of Samosata.* <span id="fr_2307"></span>[2308](#fn_2307.md)

<span id="iv.x.clxxviii-p3"></span>The illustrious Aristolaus has sent
Magisterianus from Egypt with a letter of Cyril in which he
anathematizes Arius, Eunomius, Apollinarius and all who assert Christ’s
Godhead to be passible and maintain the confusion and commixture of the
two natures. Hereat we rejoice, although he did withhold his consent
from our statement. He requires further subscription to the condemnation
which has been passed, and that the doctrine of the holy bishop
Nestorius be anathematized. Your holiness well knows that if any one
anathematizes, without distinction, the doctrine of that most holy and
venerable bishop, it is just the same as though he seemed to
anathematize true religion.

<span id="iv.x.clxxviii-p4"></span>We must then if we are compelled
anathematize those who call Christ mere man, or who divide our one Lord
Jesus Christ into two sons and deny His divinity, etc.
