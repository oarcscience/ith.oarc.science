<span id="iv.x.xciv-p1"></span> *XCIV. To Protogenes* <span
id="fr_1806"></span>[1807](#fn_1806) *The Præfect.*

<span id="iv.x.xciv-p3"></span>The loving-kindness of the Lord has
already given you an opportunity of carrying out your good intentions.
He has given you a greater opportunity now, that your excellency may the
more easily champion the cause of the truth that is assailed, bring lies
to nought, and give the churches the calm for which they so intensely
long. Your excellency has already learned from many other sources how
great is the surge by which the churches in the East are overwhelmed,
but you will acquire more accurate information concerning it from the
very religious bishops who, on account of it, have undertaken their long
journey in <span id="page_285">p. 285</span> <span
id="iv.x.xciv-Page_285"></span>the winter, relying, next after the Grace
of God, on the providence of your authority. Disperse for us, then, O
Christian man, the storm, change the moonless night into clear sunshine,
and bridle the tongues set wagging against us. We by God’s grace are
ever fighting for the apostolic decrees, and we preserve undefiled the
faith laid down at Nicæa, and style impious all who dare to violate its
dogmas. In evidence of the truth of what I say may be cited my
catechumens, those who are from time to time baptized by me, and the
hearers of my discourses in the churches. If they mean to accuse me in
accordance with the law, they must convict me in my presence, not
slander me in my absence. In this manner your excellency, when giving
judgment in other cases, is wont to deliver your sentences, perceiving
on which side lies the right from the pleadings both of the prosecution
and of the defence.
