<span id="iv.x.lvii-p1"></span> *LVII. To the Præfect Eutrechius.* <span
id="fr_1701"></span>[1702](#fn_1701)

<span id="iv.x.lvii-p3"></span>Besides other boons the Ruler of the
universe has granted to us that of hearing of your excellency’s honour,
and of congratulating at once yourself on your elevation and your
subjects on so gentle a rule. I have thought it wrong to give no
expression to my satisfaction and to refrain from manifesting it by
letter. Your magnificence knows quite well how warm is our affection
towards you—an affection most warmly reciprocated. And being so filled
with love we beseech the Giver of all good things ever to pour on you
His manifold gifts.
