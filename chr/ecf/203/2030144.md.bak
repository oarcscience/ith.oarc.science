<span id="iv.viii.v.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.v.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV</span>.—*Of Eusebius* <span
id="fr_813"></span>[814](#fn_813.md) *Bishop of Samosata*.

<span id="iv.viii.v.iv-p3"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.v.iv-p3.1"></span>Apollinarius</span> after thus failing to
get the government of the churches, continued, for the future, openly to
preach his new fangled doctrine, and constituted himself leader of the
heresy. He resided for the most part at Laodicea; but at Antioch he had
already ordained Vitalius, a man of excellent character, brought up in
the apostolic doctrines, but afterwards tainted with the heresy.
Diodorus, whom I have already mentioned, <span
id="fr_814"></span>[815](#fn_814.md) who in the great storm had saved the
ship of the church from sinking, had been appointed by the divine
Meletius, bishop of Tarsus, and had received the charge of the
Cilicians. The see of Apamea <span id="fr_815"></span>[816](#fn_815.md)
Meletius entrusted to John, a man of illustrious birth, more
distinguished for his own high qualities than for those of his
forefathers, for he was conspicuous alike for the beauty of his teaching
and of his life. In the time of the tempest he piloted the assembly of
his fellows in the faith supported by the worthy Stephanus. The latter
was however translated by the divine Meletius to carry on another
contest, for on the arrival of intelligence that Germanicia had been
contaminated by the Eudoxian pest he was sent thither as a physician to
ward off the disease, thoroughly trained as he had been in a complete
heathen education as well as nurtured in the Divine doctrines. He did
not disappoint the expectations formed of him, for by the power <span
id="page_134">p. 134</span> <span id="iv.viii.v.iv-Page_134"></span>of
his spiritual instruction he turned the wolves into sheep. <span
id="fr_816"></span>[817](#fn_816.md)

<span id="iv.viii.v.iv-p7"></span>On the return of the great Eusebius
from exile he ordained Acacius whose fame is great at Berœa, <span
id="fr_817"></span>[818](#fn_817.md) and at Hierapolis Theodotus, <span
id="fr_818"></span>[819](#fn_818.md) whose ascetic life is to this day in
all men’s mouths. Eusebius <span id="fr_819"></span>[820](#fn_819.md) was
moreover appointed to the see of Chalcis, and Isidorus <span
id="fr_820"></span>[821](#fn_820.md) to our own city of Cyrus; both
admirable men, conspicuous for their divine zeal.

<span id="iv.viii.v.iv-p12"></span>Meletius is also reported to have
ordained to the pastorate of Edessa, where the godly Barses had already
departed this life, Eulogius, <span id="fr_821"></span>[822](#fn_821.md)
the well known champion of apostolic doctrines, who had been sent to
Antinone with Protogenes. Eulogius gave Protogenes, <span
id="fr_822"></span>[823](#fn_822.md) his companion in hard service, the
charge of Carræ, a healing physician for a sick city.

<span id="iv.viii.v.iv-p15"></span>Lastly the divine Eusebius ordained
Maris, Bishop of Doliche, <span id="fr_823"></span>[824](#fn_823.md) a
little city at that time infected with the Arian plague. With the
intention of enthroning this Maris, a right worthy man, illustrious for
various virtues, in the episcopal chair, the great Eusebius came to
Doliche. As he was entering into the town a woman thoroughly infected
with the Arian plague let fall a tile from the roof, which crushed in
his head and so wounded him that not long after he departed to the
better life. As he lay a-dying he charged the bystanders not to exact
the slightest penalty from the woman who had done the deed, and bound
them under oaths to obey him. Thus he imitated his own Lord, who of them
that crucified Him said “Father forgive them for they know not what they
do.” <span id="fr_824"></span>[825](#fn_824.md)

<span id="iv.viii.v.iv-p18"></span>Thus, too, he followed the example of
Stephanus, his fellow slave, who, after the stones had stormed upon him,
cried aloud, “Lord lay not this sin to their charge.” <span
id="fr_825"></span>[826](#fn_825.md) So died the great Eusebius after many
and various struggles. He had escaped the barbarians in Thrace, but he
did not escape the violence of impious heretics, and by their means won
the martyr’s crown. <span id="fr_826"></span>[827](#fn_826.md)

<span id="iv.viii.v.iv-p22"></span>These events happened after the
return of the bishops, and now Gratian learnt that Thrace was being laid
waste by the barbarians who had burnt Valens, so he left Italy and
proceeded to Pannonia.

<span id="iv.viii.v.iv-p11"></span> Also one of Marcian’s Easter party.
As well as these bishops there were present some men of high rank and
position, who were earnest Christians. When all were seated, Marcian was
asked to address them. “But he fetched a deep sigh and said ‘the God of
all day by day utters his voice by means of the visible world, and in
the divine scriptures discourses with us, urging on us our duties,
telling us what is befitting, terrifying us by threats, winning us by
promises, and all the while we get no good. Marcian turns away this good
like the rest of his kind, and does not care to enjoy its blessing. What
could be the use of his lifting up his voice?’” Relig. Hist. iii. 3.
