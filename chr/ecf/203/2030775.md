<span id="vi.xii.ii.iii-p1"></span> 2. He professes in the first place
to be replying to insinuations made at Rome against his orthodoxy, he
being a man most fully approved in respect both of divine faith and of
charity. He says that he would have wished to come himself, were it not
that he had lately returned, after thirty years’ absence, to his
parents, and that it would have seemed harsh and inhuman to leave them
after having been so long in coming to them; and also if he had not
become somewhat less robust through his long and toilsome journey, and
too infirm to begin his labours again. As he had not been able to come
himself, he had sent his apology as a kind of literary cudgel which the
bishop might hold in his hand and drive away the dogs who were raging
against him. If he is a man approved for his divine faith and charity by
all, and especially by the Bishop to whom he writes; how is it that at
Rome he is assailed and reviled, and that the reports of the attacks
upon his reputation grow thicker. Further, what sort of humility is
this, that a man speaks of himself as approved for his divine faith and
charity? The Apostles prayed, <span id="fr_3081"></span>[3082](#fn_3081.md)
“Lord <span id="page_502">p. 502</span> <span
id="vi.xii.ii.iii-Page_502"></span>increase our faith,” and received for
answer: “If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed;” and even to Peter
it is said: <span id="fr_3082"></span>[3083](#fn_3082.md) “O thou of little
faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?” Why should I speak of charity, which
is greater than either faith or hope, and which Paul says he hopes for
rather than assumes: without which even the blood shed in martyrdom and
the body given up to the flames has no reward to crown it. Yet both of
these our friend claims as his own: in such a way, however, that there
still remain creatures who bark against him, and who will go on barking
unless the illustrious Pontiff drives them away with his stick. But how
absurd is this plea which he puts forward, of having returned to his
parents after thirty years. Why, he has got neither father nor mother!
He left them alive when he was a young man, and, now that he is old, he
pines for them when they are dead. But perhaps, he means by “parents,”
what is meant in the talk of the soldiers and the common people, his
kinsfolk and relations; well, he says he does not wish to be thought so
harsh and inhuman as to desert them; and therefore he leaves his
home <span id="fr_3083"></span>[3084](#fn_3083.md) and goes to live at
Aquileia. That most approved faith of his is in great peril at Rome, and
yet he lies on his back, being a bit tired after thirty years, and
cannot make that very easy journey in a carriage along that Flaminian
Way. He puts forward his lassitude after his long journey, as if he had
done nothing but move about for thirty years, or as if, after resting at
Aquileia for two years, he was still worn out with the labour of his
past travels.

[Next: A criticism on Rufinus' Apology to Anastasius. His excuses for
not coming to Rome are absurd. His parents are dead and the journey is
easy. No one ever heard before of his being imprisoned or exiled for the
faith.](2030776.md)
