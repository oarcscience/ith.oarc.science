<span id="iv.viii.i.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.i.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII</span>.—*Confutation of
Arianism deduced from the Writings of Eustathius and Athanasius*.

<span id="iv.viii.i.viii-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.i.viii-p2.1"></span>The</span> above-named bishops, however,
did not consent to it in sincerity, but only in appearance. This was
afterwards shewn by their plotting against those who were foremost in
zeal for religion, as well as by what these latter have written about
them. For instance, Eustathius, the famous bishop of Antioch, who has
been already mentioned, when explaining the text in the Proverbs, ‘*The
Lord created me in the beginning of His way, before His works of
old* <span id="fr_339"></span>[340](#fn_339.md) ,’ wrote against them, and
refuted their blasphemy.

<span id="iv.viii.i.viii-p4"></span> <span
id="fr_340"></span>[341](#fn_340.md) “I <span class="c14"><span
id="iv.viii.i.viii-p5.3"></span>will</span> now proceed to relate how
these different events occurred. A general council was summoned at
Nicæa, and about two hundred and seventy bishops were convened. There
were, however, so many assembled that I cannot state their exact number,
neither, indeed, have I taken any great trouble to ascertain this point.
When they began to inquire into the nature of the faith, the formulary
of Eusebius was brought forward, which contained undisguised evidence of
his blasphemy. The reading of it before all occasioned great grief to
the audience, on account of its departure from the faith, while it
inflicted irremediable shame on the writer. After the Eusebian gang had
been clearly convicted, and the impious writing had been torn up in the
sight of all, some amongst them by concert, under the pretence of
preserving peace, imposed silence on all the ablest speakers. The
Ariomaniacs, fearing lest they should be ejected from the Church by so
numerous a council of bishops, sprang forward to anathematize and
condemn the doctrines condemned, and unanimously signed the confession
of faith. Thus having retained possession of their episcopal seats
through the most shameful deception, although they ought rather to have
been degraded, they continue, sometimes secretly, and sometimes openly,
to patronize the condemned doctrines, plotting against the truth by
various arguments. Wholly bent upon establishing these plantations of
tares, they shrink from the scrutiny of the intelligent, avoid the
observant, and attack the preachers of godliness. But we do not believe
that these atheists can ever thus overcome the Deity. For though they
‘*gird themselves*’ they ‘*shall be broken in pieces,*’ according to the
solemn prophecy of Isaiah <span id="fr_341"></span>[342](#fn_341.md) .”

<span id="iv.viii.i.viii-p7"></span>These are the words of the great
Eustathius. Athanasius, his fellow combatant, the champion of the truth,
who succeeded the celebrated Alexander in the episcopate, added the
following, in a letter addressed to the Africans.

<span id="iv.viii.i.viii-p8"></span>“The bishops convened in council
being <span id="page_45">p. 45</span> <span
id="iv.viii.i.viii-Page_45"></span>desirous of refuting the impious
assertions invented by the Arians, that the Son was created out of that
which was non-existent <span id="fr_342"></span>[343](#fn_342.md) , that He
is a creature and created being <span id="fr_343"></span>[344](#fn_343.md)
, that there was a period in which He was not <span
id="fr_344"></span>[345](#fn_344.md) , and that He is mutable by nature,
and being all agreed in propounding the following declarations, which
are in accordance with the holy Scriptures; namely, that the Son is by
nature only-begotten of God, Word, Power, and sole Wisdom of the Father;
that He is, as John said, ‘the true God <span
id="fr_345"></span>[346](#fn_345.md) ,’ and, as Paul has written, ‘the
brightness of the glory, and the express image of the person of the
Father <span id="fr_346"></span>[347](#fn_346.md) ,’ the followers of
Eusebius, drawn aside by their own vile doctrine, then began to say one
to another, Let us agree, for we are also of God; ‘*There is but one
God, by whom are all things* <span id="fr_347"></span>[348](#fn_347.md) ;
‘*Old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new, and all
things are of God* <span id="fr_348"></span>[349](#fn_348.md) .’ They also
dwelt particularly upon what is contained in ‘The Shepherd <span
id="fr_349"></span>[350](#fn_349.md) :’ ‘Believe above all that there is
one God, who created and fashioned all things, and making them to be out
of that which is not.’

<span id="iv.viii.i.viii-p17"></span>“But the bishops saw through their
evil design and impious artifice, and gave a clearer elucidation of the
words ‘of God,’ and wrote, that the Son is of the substance of God; in
order that while the creatures, which do not in any way derive their
existence of or from themselves, are said to be of God, the Son alone is
said to be of the substance of the Father; this being peculiar to the
only-begotten Son, the true Word of the Father. This is the reason why
the bishops wrote, that He is of the substance of the Father.

<span id="iv.viii.i.viii-p18"></span>“But when the Arians, who seemed
few in number, were again interrogated by the Bishops as to whether they
admitted ‘that the Son is not a creature, but Power, and sole Wisdom,
and eternal unchangeable <span id="fr_350"></span>[351](#fn_350.md) Image
of the Father; and that He is very God,’ the Eusebians were noticed
making signs to one another to shew that these declarations were equally
applicable to us. For it is said, that we are ‘*the image and glory of
God* <span id="fr_351"></span>[352](#fn_351.md) ;’ and ‘*for always we who
live* <span id="fr_352"></span>[353](#fn_352.md) :’ there are, also, they
said, many powers; for it is written—‘*All the power of God went out of
the land of Egypt* <span id="fr_353"></span>[354](#fn_353.md) .’ The
canker-worm and the locust are said to be ‘*a great power* <span
id="fr_354"></span>[355](#fn_354.md) .’ And elsewhere it is written, *The
God of powers is with us, the God of Jacob helper* <span
id="fr_355"></span>[356](#fn_355.md) .’ To which may be added that we are
God’s own not simply, but because the Son called us ‘*brethren* <span
id="fr_356"></span>[357](#fn_356.md) .’ The declaration that Christ is ‘the
true God’ does not distress us, for, having come into being, He is true.

<span id="iv.viii.i.viii-p26"></span>“Such was the corrupt opinion of
the Arians; but on this the bishops, having detected their deceitfulness
in this matter, collected from Scripture those passages which say of
Christ that He is the glory, the fountain, the stream, and the express
image of the person; and they quoted the following words: ‘*In thy light
we shall see light* <span id="fr_357"></span>[358](#fn_357.md) ;’ and
likewise, ‘*I and the Father are one* <span
id="fr_358"></span>[359](#fn_358.md) .’ They then, with still greater
clearness, briefly declared that the Son is of one substance with the
Father; for this, indeed, is the signification of the passages which
have been quoted. The complaint of the Arians, that these precise words
are not to be found in Scripture, is proved groundless by their own
practice, for their own impious assertions are not taken from Scripture;
for it is not written that the Son is of the non-existent, and that
there was a time when He was not: and yet they complain of having been
condemned by expressions which, though not actually in Scripture, are in
accordance with true religion. They themselves, on the other hand, as
though they had found their words on a dunghill, uttered things verily
of earth. The bishops, on the contrary, did not find their expressions
for themselves; but, received their testimony from the fathers, and
wrote accordingly. Indeed, there were bishops of old time, nearly one
hundred and thirty years ago, both of the great city of Rome and of our
own city <span id="fr_359"></span>[360](#fn_359.md) , who condemned those
who asserted that the Son is a creature, and that He is not of one
substance with the Father. Eusebius, the bishop of Cæsarea, was
acquainted with these facts; he, at one time, favoured the Arian heresy,
but he afterwards signed the confession of faith of the Council of
Nicæa. He wrote to the people of his diocese, maintaining that the word
‘consubstantial’ was ‘used by illustrious bishops and learned writers as
a term for expressing the divinity of the Father and of the Son <span
id="fr_360"></span>[361](#fn_360.md) .’”

<span id="iv.viii.i.viii-p31"></span>So these men concealed their
unsoundness through fear of the majority, and gave their <span
id="page_46">p. 46</span> <span
id="iv.viii.i.viii-Page_46"></span>assent to the decisions of the
council, thus drawing upon themselves the condemnation of the prophet,
for the God of all cries unto them, “*This people honour Me with their
lips, but in their hearts they are far from Me* <span
id="fr_361"></span>[362](#fn_361.md) .” Theonas and Secundus, however, did
not like to take this course, and were excommunicated by common consent
as men who esteemed the Arian blasphemy above evangelical doctrine. The
bishops then returned to the council, and drew up twenty laws to
regulate the discipline of the Church.
