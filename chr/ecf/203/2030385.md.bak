<span id="v.iii.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="v.iii.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter II.</span>

<span id="v.iii.iv-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="v.iii.iv-p2.1"></span>James</span>, <span
id="fr_2342"></span>[2343](#fn_2342.md) who is called the brother of the
Lord, <span id="fr_2343"></span>[2344](#fn_2343.md) surnamed the Just, the
son of Joseph by another wife, as some think, but, as appears to me, the
son of Mary sister of the mother of our Lord of whom John makes mention
in his book, <span id="fr_2344"></span>[2345](#fn_2344.md) after our Lord’s
passion at once ordained by the apostles bishop of Jerusalem, wrote a
single epistle, which is reckoned among the seven Catholic Epistles and
even this is claimed by some to have been published by some one else
under his name, and gradually, as time went on, to have gained
authority. Hegesippus who lived near the apostolic age, in the fifth
book of his Commentaries, writing of James, says “After the apostles,
James the brother of the Lord surnamed the Just was made head of the
Church at Jerusalem. Many indeed are called James. This one was holy
from his mother’s womb. He drank neither wine nor strong drink, ate no
flesh, never shaved or anointed himself with ointment or bathed. He
alone had the privilege of entering the Holy of Holies, since indeed he
did not use woolen vestments but linen and went alone into the temple
and prayed in behalf of the people, insomuch that his knees were reputed
to have acquired the hardness of camels’ knees.” He says also many other
things, too numerous to mention. Josephus also in the 20th book of his
Antiquities, and Clement in the 7th of his Outlines mention that on the
death of Festus who reigned over Judea, Albinus was sent by Nero as his
successor. Before he had reached his province, Ananias the high priest,
the youthful son of Ananus of the priestly class taking advantage of the
state of anarchy, assembled a council and publicly tried to force James
to deny that Christ is the son of God. When he refused Ananius ordered
him to be stoned. Cast down from a pinnacle of the temple, his legs
broken, but still half alive, <span id="page_362">p. 362</span> <span
id="v.iii.iv-Page_362"></span>raising his hands to heaven he said, “Lord
forgive them for they know not what they do.” Then struck on the head by
the club of a fuller such a club as fullers are accustomed to wring out
garments <span id="fr_2345"></span>[2346](#fn_2345.md) with—he died. This
same Josephus records the tradition that this James was of so great
sanctity and reputation among the people that the downfall of Jerusalem
was believed to be on account of his death. He it is of whom the apostle
Paul writes to the Galatians that “No one else of the apostles did I see
except James the brother of the Lord,” and shortly after the event the
Acts of the apostles bear witness to the matter. The Gospel also which
is called the Gospel according to the Hebrews, <span
id="fr_2346"></span>[2347](#fn_2346.md) and which I have recently
translated into Greek and Latin and which also Origen <span
id="fr_2347"></span>[2348](#fn_2347.md) often makes use of, after the
account of the resurrection of the Saviour says, “but the Lord, after he
had given his grave clothes to the servant of the priest, appeared to
James (for James had sworn that he would not eat bread from that hour in
which he drank the cup of the Lord until he should see him rising again
from among those that sleep)” and again, a little later, it says “‘Bring
a table and bread,’ said the Lord.” And immediately it is added, “He
brought bread and blessed and brake and gave to James the Just and said
to him, ‘my brother eat thy bread, for the son of man is risen from
among those that sleep.’” And so he ruled the church of Jerusalem thirty
years, that is until the seventh year of Nero, and was buried near the
temple from which he had been cast down. His tombstone with its
inscription was well known until the siege of Titus and the end of
Hadrian’s reign. Some of our writers think he was buried in Mount
Olivet, but they are mistaken.
