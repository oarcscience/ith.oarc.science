brand us with the stain of this false teaching by speaking to some of
our brethren, and he repeats this by various letters, according to his
recognized plan of action. It is nothing to me what he may write or
assert, but, since he raises this question about a doctrine of perjury,
I will state my opinion upon it, and then leave him to pass judgment
upon himself. It is this. Since our Lord and Saviour says in the Gospels
“It was said to them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but
shalt pay to the Lord thy vows, but I say unto you, Swear not at
all;” <span id="fr_2932"></span>[2933](#fn_2932.md) I say that every one
who teaches that for any cause whatever we may swear falsely, is alien
from the faith of Christ and from the unity of the catholic church.
