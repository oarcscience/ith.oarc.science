<span id="iv.x.liii-p1"></span> *LIII. To Sophronius, Bishop of
Constantina*. <span id="fr_1700"></span>[1701](#fn_1700.md)

<span id="iv.x.liii-p3"></span>Since I know, O God-beloved, how generous
and bountiful is your right hand, I put a coveted boon within your
reach; for just as men hungry for this world’s gain are annoyed at the
sight of them that stand in need of pecuniary aid, so the liberal are
delighted, because the riches they reach after are heavenly. A man who
furnishes this excellent opportunity is the God-beloved bishop
Cyprianus, formerly known among them that minister to others, but now,
while he gives a deplorable account of the African calamities, he has to
look to the benevolence of others, and depends on the bounty of pious
souls. I hope that he too will enjoy your brotherly kindness, and will
be forwarded with letters to other havens of refuge.
