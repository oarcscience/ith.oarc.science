another letter to Marcella:

<span id="vi.xi.iii.xxii-p2"></span>“The blessed Martyr Pamphilus, whose
life Eusebius the Bishop of Cæsarea set forth in some three volumes,
wished to rival Demetrius Phalereus and Pisistratus, in his zeal to
establish a library of sacred books: he sought out all through the world
representative works of great minds, which are their true and
everlasting monuments; but most of all he acquired at great expense all
the books written by Origen, and gave them to the church at Cæsarea.
This library was afterwards partly destroyed; but Acatius and later on
Euzoius, Bishops of that church, endeavoured to reestablish it in
parchment volumes. The last of these recovered a great many works, and
left us an inventory of them, but he shews that he could not find the
Commentary on the hundred and twenty-sixth Psalm and the Tract on the
Hebrew letter Pe, by the fact that he does not mention it. Not that so
great a man as Adamantius passed over anything, but that, through the
negligence of his successors it did not remain to times within our
memory.”
