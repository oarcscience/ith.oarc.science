<span id="iv.x.lxxiii-p1"></span> *LXXIII. To Apollonius.* <span
id="fr_1717"></span>[1718](#fn_1717.md)

<span id="iv.x.lxxiii-p3"></span>Themistocles the son of Neocles, the
far-famed and admirable general, is described by the admiring historian
as endowed with natural virtue alone. Of Pericles, however, the son of
Xanthippus, it is said that he also derived ability from his education
to charm his hearers by his persuasive eloquence, and was gifted with
the power alike of knowing what measures should be taken and of
enforcing them by word of mouth. In writing about him there is no
impropriety in my using his own words. These things illustrate your
magnificence, for God, our Creator, hath given you natural capacity, and
your education makes its brilliance the more conspicuous. Nothing then
is wanting to the full complement of your high qualities save only
knowledge of their Author; be but this added, and the tale of virtues
which we shall have will be complete. Thus I write to you on receiving
news of your arrival, beseeching the Giver of all good to grant a beam
of light to your soul’s eye, to show you the greatness of His boon, to
kindle your love of that possession, and to grant the longed for favour
to him that longs for it. <span id="fr_1718"></span>[1719](#fn_1718.md)

<span id="iv.x.lxxiii-p4"></span> Thucydides, (I. 138,) writes of
Themistocles that “to a greater degree than any other man he was to be
admired for the natural ability which he displayed; for by his inborn
capacity, he was an unrivalled judge of what the emergency of the moment
required, and unsurpassed in his forecast of the future, and this
without the aid of previous or additional instruction.”

<span id="iv.x.lxxiii-p5"></span>The same historian (II. 60) records the
speech of Pericles in his own vindication in which he says “I think
myself inferior to none in knowing what measures should be taken and in
enforcing them by word of mouth.”
