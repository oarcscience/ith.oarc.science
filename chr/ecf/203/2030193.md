<span id="iv.x.iv-p1"></span> *IV. Festal.*

<span id="iv.x.iv-p2"></span>The Creator of our souls and bodies has
given His bounty to both, and at one and the same time has overwhelmed
us with good things that both heart and senses can feel. At the time of
the sacred feast He has given us the rain we so much longed for, that
our celebration might be clear of sadness. We have praised our bountiful
Lord, and now as we are wont write a festal letter and address your
piety with the request that you will aid us with your prayers.
