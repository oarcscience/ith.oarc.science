<span id="iv.viii.iv.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.iv.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII</span>.—*How Valens exiled
the virtuous bishops*.

<span id="iv.viii.iv.xii-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.iv.xii-p2.1"></span>At</span> the very time of the baptism
of Valens Eudoxius bound the unhappy man by an oath to abide in the
impiety of his doctrine, and to expel from every see the holders of
contrary opinions. Thus Valens abandoned the apostolic teaching, and
went over to the opposite faction; nor was it long before he fulfilled
the rest of his oath; for from Antioch he expelled the great Meletius,
from Samosata the divine Eusebius, and deprived Laodicea of her
admirable shepherd Pelagius. <span id="fr_711"></span>[712](#fn_711)
Pelagius had taken on him the yoke of wedlock when a very young man, and
in the very bridal chamber, on the first day of his nuptials, he
persuaded his bride to prefer chastity to conjugal intercourse, and
taught her to accept fraternal affection in the place of marriage union.
Thus he gave all honour to temperance, and possessed also within himself
the sister virtues moving in tune with her, and for these reasons he was
unanimously chosen for the bishopric. Nevertheless not even the bright
beams of his life and conversation awed the enemy of the truth. Him,
too, Valens relegated to Arabia, the divine Meletius to Armenia, and
Eusebius, <span id="page_116">p. 116</span> <span
id="iv.viii.iv.xii-Page_116"></span>that unflagging labourer in
apostolic work to Thrace. Unflagging he was indeed, for when apprised
that many churches were now deprived of their shepherds, he travelled
about Syria, Phœnicia and Palestine, wearing the garb of war and
covering his head with a tiara, ordaining presbyters and deacons and
filling up the other ranks of the Church; and if haply he lighted on
bishops with like sentiments with his own, he appointed them to empty
churches.
