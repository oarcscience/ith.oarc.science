<span id="vi.xii.ii.viii"></span>

<span id="vi.xii.ii.viii-p1"></span> 7. To proceed:

<span id="vi.xii.ii.viii-p2"></span>“This is a great spear with which
the devil is pierced, he, ‘who is the universal cause of sin,’ if he is
to render account of his works, like a man, and ‘with his angels possess
the inheritance of eternal fires.’ This, no doubt, was what was lacking
to him, that, having brought mankind into torment, he should himself
‘possess the eternal fires’ which he had all the while been longing
for.”

<span id="vi.xii.ii.viii-p3"></span>You seem to me here to speak a
little too hardly of the devil, and to assail the accuser of all with
false accusations. You say ‘he <span id="page_504">p. 504</span> <span
id="vi.xii.ii.viii-Page_504"></span>is the universal cause of sin;’ and,
while you make him the author of all crimes, you free men from fault,
and take away the freedom of the will. Our Lord says that <span
id="fr_3090"></span>[3091](#fn_3090.md) ‘from our heart come forth evil
thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witnesses,
railings,’ and of Judas we read in the Gospel; <span
id="fr_3091"></span>[3092](#fn_3091.md) “After the sop Satan entered into
him,” that is, because he had before the sop sinned voluntarily, and had
not been brought to repentance either by humbling himself or by the
forbearance of the Saviour. So also the Apostle says; <span
id="fr_3092"></span>[3093](#fn_3092.md) “Such men I delivered to Satan,
that they might be taught not to blaspheme.” He delivered to Satan as to
a torturer, with a view to their punishment, those who, before they had
been delivered to him learned to blaspheme by their own will. David also
draws the distinction in a few words between the faults due to his own
will and the incentives of vice when he says <span
id="fr_3093"></span>[3094](#fn_3093.md) “Cleanse thou me from my secret
faults, and keep back thy servant from alien sins.” We read also in
Ecclesiastes <span id="fr_3094"></span>[3095](#fn_3094.md) “If the spirit
of a ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place;” from which we may
clearly see that we commit sin if we give opportunity to the power which
rises up, and if we fail to hurl down headlong the enemy who is scaling
our walls. As to your threatening your brothers, that is, those who
accuse you, with eternal fire in company with the devil, it seems to me
that you do not so much drag your brethren down as raise the devil up,
since he, according to you, is to be punished only with the same fires
as Christian men. But you well know, I think, what eternal fires mean
according to the ideas of Origen, namely, the sinners’ conscience, and
the remorse which galls their hearts within. These ideas he thinks are
intended in the words of Isaiah: <span
id="fr_3095"></span>[3096](#fn_3095.md) “Their worm shall not die neither
shall their fire be quenched.” And in the words addressed to
Babylon: <span id="fr_3096"></span>[3097](#fn_3096.md) “Thou hast coals of
fire, thou shalt sit upon them, these shall be thy help.” So also in the
Psalm it is said to the penitent; <span
id="fr_3097"></span>[3098](#fn_3097.md) “What shall be given to thee, or
what shall be done more for thee against the false tongue? Sharp arrows
of the mighty, with desolating coals;” which means (according to him)
that the arrows of God’s precepts (concerning which the Prophet says in
another place, <span id="fr_3098"></span>[3099](#fn_3098.md) “I lived in
misery while a thorn pierces me”) should wound and strike through the
crafty tongue, and make an end of sins in it. He also interprets the
place where the Lord testifies saying: <span
id="fr_3099"></span>[3100](#fn_3099.md) “I came to send fire on the earth,
and how I wish that it may burn” as meaning “I wish that all may repent,
and burn out through the Holy spirit their vices and their sins; for I
am he of whom it is written, <span id="fr_3100"></span>[3101](#fn_3100.md)
“Our God is a consuming fire;” it is no great thing then to say this of
the devil, since it is prepared also for men.” You ought rather to have
said, if you wished to avoid the suspicion of believing in the salvation
of the devil; <span id="fr_3101"></span>[3102](#fn_3101.md) “Thou hast
become perdition and shalt not be for ever;” and as the Lord speaks to
Job concerning the devil, <span id="fr_3102"></span>[3103](#fn_3102.md)
“Behold his hope shall fail him and in the sight of all shall he be cast
down. I will not arouse him as one that is cruel, for who can resist my
countenance? Who has first given to me that I may return it to him? for
all things beneath the heaven are mine. I will not spare him and his
words that are powerful and fashioned to turn away wrath.” Hence, these
things may pass as the work of a plain man. Their bearing is evident
enough to those who understand these matters; but to the unlearned they
may wear the appearance of innocence.

[Next: His confession of faith is unsatisfactory. No one asked him about
the Trinity, but about Origen's doctrines of the Resurrection, the
origin of souls, and the salvability of Satan. As to the Resurrection
and to Satan he is ambiguous. As to souls he professes
ignorance.](2030781.md)
