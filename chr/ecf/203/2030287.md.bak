<span id="iv.x.xcviii-p1"></span> *XCVIII. To Pancharius.*

<span id="iv.x.xcviii-p2"></span>We are distressed to see the tempest of
the churches, but their Master and Ruler ever through mighty billows
shows to men His own wisdom and power. He rebukes the winds and brings
about a calm as He did when He was in the apostles boat. <span
id="fr_1816"></span>[1817](#fn_1816.md) So though I am distressed,
nevertheless because I know this power of our Saviour and am aware of
what He arranges for us, even though adversity befall me, I give thanks
and accept it as a gift of God. I have learned the lesson to care little
for the present, and to wait for the expected blessings. But it behoves
your excellency zealously to defend the apostolic faith, that you may
receive from the God of all the recompense of such conduct.
