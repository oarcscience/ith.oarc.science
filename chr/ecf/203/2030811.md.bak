<span id="vi.xii.iii.ix-p1"></span> 8. I confess, I immediately set to
work to reply to the insinuations directed against me, and tried with
all my might to prove that I was no heretic, and I sent these books of
my Apology to those whom your book had pained, so that your poison might
be followed by my antidote. In reply to this, you sent me your former
books, and now send me this last letter, full of injurious language and
accusations. My good friend, what do you expect me to do? To keep
silence? That would be to acknowledge myself guilty. To speak? But you
hold your sword over my head, and threaten me with an indictment, no
longer before the church but before the law-courts. What have I done
that deserves punishment? Wherein have I injured you? Is it that I have
shewn myself not to be a heretic? or that I could not esteem myself
worthy of your praises? or that I laid bare in plain words the tricks
and perjuries of the heretics? What is all this to you who boast
yourself a true man and a catholic, and who shew more zeal in attacking
me than in defending yourself? Must I be thought to be attacking you
because I defend myself? or is it impossible that you should be orthodox
unless you prove me to be a heretic? What help can it give you to be
connected with me? and what is the meaning of your action? You are
accused by one set of people and you answer only by attacking another.
You find an attack made on you by one man, and you turn your back upon
him and attack another who was for leaving you alone.
