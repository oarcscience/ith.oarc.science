<span id="iv.viii.iv.xx-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.iv.xx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XX</span>.—*Of Mavia,* <span
id="fr_758"></span>[759](#fn_758.md) *Queen of the Saracens, and the
ordination* <span id="fr_759"></span>[760](#fn_759.md) *of Moses the monk.*

<span id="iv.viii.iv.xx-p4"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.iv.xx-p4.1"></span>At</span> this time <span
id="fr_760"></span>[761](#fn_760.md) the Ishmaelites were devastating the
country in the neighbourhood of <span id="page_126">p. 126</span> <span
id="iv.viii.iv.xx-Page_126"></span>the Roman frontier. They were led by
Mavia, a princess who regarded not the sex which nature had given her,
and displayed the spirit and courage of a man. After many engagements
she made a truce, and, on receiving the light of divine knowledge,
begged that to the dignity of high priest of her tribe might be advanced
one, Moses by name, who dwelt on the confines of Egypt and Palestine.
This request Valens granted, and ordered the holy man to be conveyed to
Alexandria, and there, as the most convenient place in the
neighbourhood, to receive episcopal grace. When he had arrived and saw
Lucius endeavouring to lay hands on him—“God forbid” said he “that I
should be ordained by thine hand: the grace of the Spirit visits us not
at thy calling.” “Whence,” said Lucius, “are you led to conjecture
this?” He rejoined “I am not speaking of conjecture but of clear
knowledge; for thou fightest against the apostolic decrees, and speakest
words against them, and for thy blasphemous utterances thy lawless deeds
are a match. For what impious man has not on thy account mocked the
meetings of the Church? What excellent man has not been exiled? What
barbarous savagery is not thrown into the shade by thy daily deeds?” So
the brave man said, and the murderer heard him and desired to slay him,
but was afraid of kindling once again the war which had come to an end.
Wherefore he ordered other bishops to be produced whom Moses had
requested. After receiving the episcopal grace of the right worthy faith
Moses returned to the people who had asked for him, and by his apostolic
teaching and miracles led them in the way that leads to truth. <span

<span id="iv.viii.iv.xx-p7"></span>These then were the deeds done by
Lucius in Alexandria under the dispensation of the providence of God.

<span id="iv.viii.iv.xx-p2"></span> cf. Soz. vi. 38, and Soc. iv. 36.

<span id="iv.viii.iv.xx-p3"></span> The word used is <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.viii.iv.xx-p3.1"></span>χειροτονία</span>, of
which it is well to trace the varying usages. These are given by the
late Rev. E. Hatch (Dict. Christ. Ant. ii. 1501) as follows. “This word
is used (a) in the N.T. <span id="iv.viii.iv.xx-p3.2"></span>[Acts xiv.
24](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#024.md)<span
id="iv.viii.iv.xx-p3.3"></span>, <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.viii.iv.xx-p3.4"></span>χειροτονήσαντες δὲ αὐτοῖς κατ᾽ ἐκκλησίαν
πρεσβυτέρους</span>: <span id="iv.viii.iv.xx-p3.5"></span>[2 Cor. viii.
19](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#019.md)<span
id="iv.viii.iv.xx-p3.6"></span> (of Titus) <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.viii.iv.xx-p3.7"></span>χειροτονηθεὶς ὑπὸ τῶν ἐκκλησιῶν</span>;
(b) in sub-apostolic Greek, Ignat. ad Philad. c. 10; (c) in the
Clementines, Clement. Ep. ad Jacob. c. 2; (d) in the Apostolical
Constitution; (e) in the Canon Law; (f) in the Civil Law. Its meaning
was originally “to elect,” but it came afterwards to mean even in
classical Greek, simply “to appoint to office,” without itself
indicating the particular mode of appointment (cf. Schömann de Comitüs,
p. 122). That the latter was its ordinary meaning in Hellenistic Greek,
and consequently in the first ages of church history, is clear from a
large number of instances; e.g. in Josephus vi. 13, 9, it is used of the
appointment of David as King by God; id. xiii, 22, of the appointment of
Jonathan as High Priest by Alexander; in Philo ii, 76 it is used of the
appointment of Joseph as governor by Pharaoh; in Lucian, de morte
Peregrini c. 41 of the appointment of ambassadors. “In Sozomen vii, 24
of the appointment of Arcadius as Augustus by Theodosius.” “In later
times a new connotation appears of which there is no early trace; it was
used of the stretching out of the bishop’s hands in the rite of
imposition of hands.” The writer of the above seems hardly to do justice
to its early use for ordination as well as for appointment. In the
Pseudo-Ig. ad. Her. c. iii, it is said of bishops <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.viii.iv.xx-p3.8"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.viii.iv.xx-p3.9"></span>κεῖνοι χειροτονοῦσι,
χειροθετοῦσι</span> and Bp. Lightfoot comments “while <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.viii.iv.xx-p3.10"></span>χειροθεσία</span> is
used of laying on of hands, e.g. in confirmation, <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.viii.iv.xx-p3.11"></span>χειροτονία</span> is
said of ordination, e.g. Ap. Const. viii. 27. ‘<span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.viii.iv.xx-p3.12"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.viii.iv.xx-p3.13"></span>πίσκοπος ὑπὸ τριῶν ἢ δύο ἐπισκόπων
χειροτονεῖσθω</span>.’ Referring originally to the *election* of the
Clergy <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.viii.iv.xx-p3.14"></span>χειροτονία</span> came afterwards to be
applied commonly, as here, to their *ordination.*” Theodoretus uses the
word in both senses, and sometimes either will fit in with the context.

<span id="iv.viii.iv.xx-p5"></span> i.e. about 375.

<span id="fn_761"></span>[126:762](2030126.htm#fr_761.md) <span
id="iv.viii.iv.xx-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iv.viii.iv.xx-p6"></span> Sozomen (vi. 38) describes Lucius as
remonstrating in moderate language. “Do not judge of me before you know
what my creed is.” Socrates (iv. 36) makes Moses charge Lucius with
condemning the orthodox to exile, beasts, and burning. On Socrates
Valesius annotates “Hanc narrationem de episcopo Saracenis dato et de
pace cum iisdem facta, desumpsit quidem Socrates, ex Rufini lib. ii. 6.”
Lucius was ejected from Alexandria when the reign of Valens ended with
his death in 378. Theodoretus appears to confound this Lucius with an
Arian Lucius who usurped the see of Samosata. Vide chap. xviii.
