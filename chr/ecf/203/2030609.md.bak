id="fr_2731"></span>[2732](#fn_2731.md) bishop of Cyrus (for the city
founded by Cyrus king of the Persians preserves until the present day in
Syria the name of its founder) is said to have written many works. Such
as have come to my knowledge are the following: *On the incarnation of
the Lord, Against Eutyches the presbyter and Dioscorus* bishop of
Alexandria who deny that Christ had human flesh; strong works by which
he confirmed through reason and the testimony of Scripture that He had
real flesh from the maternal substance which he derived from His Virgin
mother just as he had true deity which he received at birth by eternal
generation from God the Father. There are ten books of the
ecclesiastical history which he wrote in imitation of Eusebius of
Cæsarea beginning where Eusebius ends and extending to his own time,
that is from the Vicennalia of Constantine until the accession of the
elder Leo in whose reign he died.
