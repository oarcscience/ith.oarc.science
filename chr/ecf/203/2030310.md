<span id="iv.x.cxxi-p3"></span>Even the enemies of the truth must, I
think, be indignant at the injustice and illegality of the violence done
us. It is only reasonable that the nurslings of the truth, at whose head
stands your excellency, should be still more distressed at this new and
surprising tragedy. It is only right that those who are the more grieved
should show the more earnestness and zeal to counteract the deeds
impiously and illegally done; and restore to its previous concord the
Church’s body now in peril of being torn asunder. Wherefore I beseech
your excellency to reckon the present crisis an opportunity for
spiritual reciprocity; to give on your side earnestness on behalf of the
truth, and to receive from our generous Master alike His kindly care in
this present life and in the life to come the kingdom of heaven.
