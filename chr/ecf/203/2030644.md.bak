<span id="vi.xi.ii.vii-p1"></span> 6. Behold the discovery of this man
of the new learning! a thing which escaped the notice of the Apostles
when they delivered the faith to the Church; a thing which none of the
saints knew till it was revealed to this man by the spirit of the flesh.
He indeed cannot expound it without bringing in an indecency.
Nevertheless, I will set it forth in his hearing both more worthily and
more truly. Christ is the first fruits of those that sleep; <span
id="fr_2827"></span>[2828](#fn_2827.md) he is also called <span
id="fr_2828"></span>[2829](#fn_2828.md) the first begotten from the dead;
as also the Apostle says, <span id="fr_2829"></span>[2830](#fn_2829.md)
“Christ is the beginning, afterward they that are Christ’s.” Since then
we have Christ as the undoubted first fruits of our resurrection, how
can any question arise about the rest of us? It must be evident that,
whatever the members, the hair, the flesh, the bones, were in which
Christ rose, in the same shall we also rise. For this purpose he offered
himself to the disciples to touch after his resurrection, so that no
hesitation as to his resurrection should remain. Since then Christ has
given his own resurrection as a typical instance, one that is quite
evident, and (as I may say) capable of being felt and handled by the
hand, who can be so mad as to think that he himself will rise otherwise
than as He rose who opened the door of the resurrection? This also
confirms the truth of this confession of ours that, while it is the
actual natural flesh and no other which will rise, yet it will rise
purged from its faults and having laid aside its corruption; so that the
saying of the Apostle is true: <span
id="fr_2830"></span>[2831](#fn_2830.md) “It is sown in corruption, it will
be raised in incorruption; it is sown in dishonour, it will be raised in
glory; it is sown a natural <span id="fr_2831"></span>[2832](#fn_2831.md)
body, it will be raised a spiritual body.” Inasmuch then as it is a
spiritual body, and glorious, and incorruptible, it will be furnished
and adorned with its own proper members, not with members taken from
elsewhere, according to that glorious image of which Christ is set forth
as the perpetual type, as it is said by the Apostle: <span
id="fr_2832"></span>[2833](#fn_2832.md) “Who shall change the body of our
humiliation, that it may be conformed to the body of his glory.”
