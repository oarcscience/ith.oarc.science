<span id="iv.x.x-p1"></span> *X. To the Learned Elias.*

<span id="iv.x.x-p2"></span>Legislators have made laws in aid of the
oppressed, and advocates have practised the orator’s arts to help them
that stand in need of fair defence. You, my friend, have studied
eloquence and the law. Now put your art in practice, and by it put down
the oppressors, help them that are put down by them, and defend them
with the law as with a shield. Let no guilty client enjoy the benefit of
your advocacy, even though he be your friend.

<span id="iv.x.x-p3"></span>Now one of these guilty men is that villain
Abraham. After being settled for a considerable time on an estate
belonging to the church, he then took several partners in his rascality,
and has had no hesitation in owning his proceedings. I have sent him to
you with an account of his doings, the parties he has wronged, and the
reverend sub-deacon Gerontius. I do not want you to deliver the guilty
man to the authorities, but in the hope that when his victims have told
you all they have had to put up with, and have made you, my learned
friend, feel sympathy for their case, you may be induced to compel the
wicked fellow to restore what he has stolen.
