<span id="vi.xiii.xxxi-p1"></span> 30. It is said then in the Psalms, “I
laid me down and slept, and rose up again, because the Lord sustained
me.” <span id="fr_3363"></span>[3364](#fn_3363.md) Again, in another place,
“Because of the wretchedness of the needy and the groaning of the poor,
now will I arise, saith the Lord.” <span
id="fr_3364"></span>[3365](#fn_3364.md) And elsewhere, as we have said
above, “O Lord, thou hast brought my soul out of hell; Thou hast saved
me from them that go down into the pit.” <span
id="fr_3365"></span>[3366](#fn_3365.md) And in another place, “Because Thou
hast turned and quickened me, and brought me out of the deep of the
earth again.” <span id="fr_3366"></span>[3367](#fn_3366.md) In the 87th
Psalm He is most evidently spoken of: “He became as a man without help,
free among the dead.” <span id="fr_3367"></span>[3368](#fn_3367.md) It is
not said “a man,” but “as a man.” For in that He descended into hell, He
was “as a man:” but He was “free among the dead,” because He could not
be detained by <span id="page_555">p. 555</span> <span
id="vi.xiii.xxxi-Page_555"></span>death. And therefore in the one nature
the power of human weakness, in the other the power of divine majesty is
exhibited. The Prophet Hosea also speaks most manifestly of the third
day in this wise, “After two days He will heal us; but on the third day
we shall rise and shall live in His presence.” <span
id="fr_3368"></span>[3369](#fn_3368.md) This he says in the person of those
who, rising with Him on the third day, are recalled from death to life.
And they are the same persons who say, “On the third day we shall rise
again, and shall live in His presence.” But Isaiah says plainly, “Who
brought forth from the earth the great Shepherd of the sheep.” <span
id="fr_3369"></span>[3370](#fn_3369.md) Then, that the women were to see
His resurrection, while the Scribes and Pharisees and the people
disbelieved, this also Isaiah foretold in these words, “Ye women, who
come from beholding, come: for it is a people that hath no
understanding.” <span id="fr_3370"></span>[3371](#fn_3370.md) But as to the
women who are related to have gone to the sepulchre after the
resurrection, and to have sought Him without finding, as Mary Magdalene,
who is related to have come to the sepulchre before it was light, and
not finding Him, to have said, weeping, to the angels who were there,
“They have taken away the Lord, and I know not where they have laid
Him” <span id="fr_3371"></span>[3372](#fn_3371.md) —even this is foretold
in the Canticles: “On my bed I sought Him Whom my soul loveth; I sought
Him in the night, and found Him not.” <span
id="fr_3372"></span>[3373](#fn_3372.md) Of those also who found Him, and
held Him by the feet, it is foretold, in the same book, “I will hold Him
Whom my soul loveth, and will not let Him go.” <span
id="fr_3373"></span>[3374](#fn_3373.md) Take these passages, a few of many;
for being intent on brevity we cannot heap together more.
