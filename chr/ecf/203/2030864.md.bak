<span id="vi.xiii.xvi-p1"></span> 15. Moreover,—to touch briefly some of
the more recondite topics,—when God made the world in the beginning, He
set over it and appointed certain powers of celestial virtues by whom
the race of mortal men might be governed and directed. That this was so
done Moses signifies in the Song in Deuteronomy, “When the Most High
divided the nations, He appointed the bounds of the nations according to
the number of the angels of God.” <span
id="fr_3286"></span>[3287](#fn_3286.md) But some of these, as he who is
called the Prince of this world, did not exercise the power which God
had committed to them according to the laws by which they had received
it, nor did they teach mankind to obey God’s commandments, but taught
them rather to follow their own perverse guidance. Thus we were brought
under the bonds of sin, because, as the Prophet saith, “We were sold
under our sins.” <span id="fr_3287"></span>[3288](#fn_3287.md) For every
man, when he yields to lust, is receiving the purchase-money of his
soul. Under that bond then every man was held by those most wicked
rulers, which same bond Christ, when He came, tore down and stripped
them of this their power. This Paul signifies under a great mystery,
when he says of Him, “He destroyed the hand-writing which was against
us, nailing it to His cross, and led away principalities and powers,
triumphing over them in Himself.” <span
id="fr_3288"></span>[3289](#fn_3288.md) Those rulers, then, whom God had
set over mankind, having become contumacious and tyrannical, took in
hand to assail the men who had been committed to their charge and to
rout them utterly in the conflicts of sin, as the Prophet Ezekiel
mystically intimates when he says, “In that day angels <span
id="fr_3289"></span>[3290](#fn_3289.md) shall come forth hastening to
exterminate Ethiopia, and there shall be perturbation among them in the
day of Egypt; for behold He comes.” <span
id="fr_3290"></span>[3291](#fn_3290.md) Having stript them then of their
almighty power, Christ is said to have triumphed, and to have delivered
to men the power which was taken from them, as also Himself saith to His
disciples in the Gospel, “Behold I have given you power to tread upon
serpents and scorpions, and upon all the might of the enemy.” <span
id="fr_3291"></span>[3292](#fn_3291.md) The Cross of Christ, then, brought
those who had wrongfully abused the authority which they had received
into subjection to those who had before been in subjection to them. But
us, that is, mankind, it teaches first of all to resist sin even unto
death, and willingly to die for the sake of religion. Next, this same
Cross sets before us an example of obedience, in like manner as it hath
punished the contumacy of those who were once our rulers. Hear,
therefore, how the Apostle would teach us obedience by the Cross of
Christ: “Let this mind be in you, which was in Christ Jesus, Who, being
in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but
made Himself of no reputation, taking upon Him the form of a servant,
being made in the likeness of men; and, being found in fashion as a man,
He became obedient unto death, even the death of the Cross.” <span
id="fr_3292"></span>[3293](#fn_3292.md) As, then, a consummate master
teaches both by example and precept, so Christ taught the obedience,
which good men are to render even at the cost of death, by Himself first
dying in rendering it.
