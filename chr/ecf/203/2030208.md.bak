<span id="iv.x.xix-p1"></span> *XIX. To the Presbyter Basilius.*

<span id="iv.x.xix-p2"></span>I have found the right eloquent orator
Athanasius to be just what your letter described him. His tongue is
adorned by his speech, and his speech by his character, and all about
him is brightened by his abundant faith. Ever, most God-beloved friend,
send us such gifts. You have given me, be assured, very great pleasure
through my intercourse with him.
