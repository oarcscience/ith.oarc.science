<span id="iv.viii.iii.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.iii.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIV</span>.—*Of Artemius the
Duke.* <span id="fr_638"></span>[639](#fn_638) *Of Publia the Deaconess
and her divine boldness*.

<span id="iv.viii.iii.xiv-p3"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.iii.xiv-p3.1"></span>Artemius <span
id="fr_639"></span>[640](#fn_639) </span> commanded the troops in Egypt.
He had obtained this command in the time of Constantine, and had
destroyed most of the idols. For this reason Julian not only confiscated
his property but ordered his decapitation.

<span id="iv.viii.iii.xiv-p5"></span>These and like these were the deeds
of the man whom the impious describe as the mildest and least passionate
of men.

<span id="iv.viii.iii.xiv-p6"></span>I will now include in my history
the noble story of a right excellent woman, for even women, armed with
divine zeal, despised the mad fury of Julian.

<span id="iv.viii.iii.xiv-p7"></span>In those days there was a woman
named Publia, of high reputation, and illustrious for deeds of virtue.
For a short time she wore the yoke of marriage, and had offered its most
goodly fruit to God, for from this fair soil sprang John, who for a long
time was chief presbyter at Antioch, and was often elected to the
apostolic see, but from time to time declined the dignity. She
maintained a company of virgins vowed to virginity for life, and spent
her time in praising God who had made and saved her. One day the emperor
was passing by, and as they esteemed the Destroyer an object of contempt
and derision, they struck up all the louder music, chiefly chanting
those psalms which mock the helplessness of idols, and saying in the
words of David “The idols of the nations are of silver and gold, the
work of men’s hands,” <span id="fr_640"></span>[641](#fn_640) and after
describing their insensibility, they added “like them be they that make
them and all those that trust in them.” <span
id="fr_641"></span>[642](#fn_641) <span id="page_103">p. 103</span>
<span id="iv.viii.iii.xiv-Page_103"></span>Julian heard them, and was
very angry, and told them to hold their peace while he was passing by.
She did not however pay the least attention to his orders, but put still
greater energy into their chaunt, and when the emperor passed by again
told them to strike up “Let God arise and let his enemies be
scattered.” <span id="fr_642"></span>[643](#fn_642) On this Julian in
wrath ordered the choir mistress to be brought before him; and, though
he saw that respect was due to her old age, he neither compassionated
her gray hairs, nor respected her high character, but told some of his
escort to box both her ears, and by their violence to make her cheeks
red. She however took the outrage for honour, and returned home, where,
as was her wont, she kept up her attack upon him with her spiritual
songs, <span id="fr_643"></span>[644](#fn_643) just as the composer and
teacher of the song laid the wicked spirit that vexed Saul.

<span id="iv.viii.iii.xiv-p2"></span> By the Constitution of Constantine
the supreme military command was given to a “Magister equitum” and a

Dukes and Counts, with territorial titles.
