id="iv.viii.v.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII.—</span>*Of the death of
Gratianus and the sovereignty of Maximus*

<span id="iv.viii.v.xii-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.v.xii-p2.1"></span>Gratianus</span> in the midst of his
successes in war and wise and prudent government ended his life by
conspiracy. <span id="fr_860"></span>[861](#fn_860) He left no sons to
inherit the empire, and a brother of the same name as their father,
Valentinianus, <span id="fr_861"></span>[862](#fn_861) who was quite a
youth. So Maximus, <span id="fr_862"></span>[863](#fn_862) in contempt
of the youth of Valentinianus, seized the throne of the West.

<span id="iv.viii.v.xii-p3"></span> Gratianus made himself unpopular (i)
by his excessive addiction to sport, playing the Commodus in the
“Vivaria,” when not even a Marcus Aurelius could have answered all the
calls of the Empire. (Amm. xxxi. x. 19) and (ii) by affecting the
society and customs of barbarians (Aur. Vict. xlvii. 6). The troops in
Britain rose against him, gathered aid in the Low Countries, and
defeated him near Paris. He fled to Lyons, where he was treacherously
assassinated Aug. 25, 383. He was only twenty-four. (Soc. v. 11.)
