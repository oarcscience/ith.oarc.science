id="fr_2507"></span>[2508](#fn_2507) a Pamphilian from Side,
bishop <span id="fr_2508"></span>[2509](#fn_2508) first of Berœa in
Syria and then of Antioch, ruled the church and, composing many things
against the doctrine of the Arians, was driven into exile under the
emperor Constantius <span id="fr_2509"></span>[2510](#fn_2509) into
Trajanopolis in Thrace where he is until this day. Works of his are
extant *On the soul, On ventriloquism Against Origen* and *Letters* too
numerous to mention.

<span id="v.iii.lxxxvii-p3"></span> Died 337, (or according to others
370–82.) Jerome in this chapter seems, unless the usual modern view is
confused, to have mixed up Eustathius of Antioch with Eusebius of
Sebaste.

<span id="v.iii.lxxxvii-p5"></span> *Constantius* this is supposed to be
an evident slip for *Constantinus* (Compare Venables in Smith and Wace
*Dict.* v. 2, p. 383) but if there is confusion with Eustathius of
Sebaste as suggested above possibly the latter’s deposition by
Constantius is referred to. But the difficulty remains almost as great.
