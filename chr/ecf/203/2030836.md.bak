<span id="vi.xii.iii.xxxiv-p1"></span> 33. I now come to the most
serious charge of all, that in which you accuse me of having been
unfaithful after the restoration of our friendship. I confess that, of
all the reproaches which you bring against me or threaten me with, there
is none which I would so much deprecate as that of fraud, deceit and
breach of faith. To sin is human, to lay snares is diabolical. What! Was
it for this that I joined hands with you over the slain lamb in the
Church of the Resurrection, that I might ‘steal your manuscripts at
Rome’? or that I might ‘send out my dogs to gnaw away your papers before
they were corrected’? Can any one believe that we made ready the
accusers before you had committed the crime? Is it supposed that we knew
what plans you were meditating in your heart? or what another man had
been dreaming? or how the Greek proverb was having its fulfilment in
your case, “the pig teaches Minerva”? If I sent Eusebius to bark against
you, who then stirred up the passion of Aterbius and others against you?
Is it not the fact that he thought that I also was a heretic because of
my friendship with you? And, when I had given him satisfaction as to the
heresies of Origen, you shut yourself up at home, and never dared to
meet him, for fear you should have to condemn what you wished not to
condemn, or by openly resisting him should subject yourself to the
reproach of heresy. Do you think that he cannot be called as a witness
against you because he is your accuser? Before ever the reverend bishop
Epiphanius came to Jerusalem, and gave you the signs of peace by word
and kiss, ‘yet having evil thoughts and guile in his heart’; before I
translated for him that letter <span
id="fr_3198"></span>[3199](#fn_3198.md) which was such a reproof to you,
and in which he wrote you down a heretic though he had before approved
you as orthodox; Aterbius was barking against you at Jerusalem, and, if
he had not speedily taken himself off, would have felt not your literary
cudgel but the stick you flourish in your right hand to drive the dogs
away. <span id="fr_3199"></span>[3200](#fn_3199.md)
