<span id="iv.x.lxiv-p1"></span> *LXIV. Festal.*

<span id="iv.x.lxiv-p2"></span>When the Master underwent the Passion of
salvation for the sake of mankind, the company of the sacred Apostles
was much disheartened, for they knew not clearly what was to be the
Passion’s fruit. But when they knew the salvation that grew therefrom,
they called the proclamation of the Passion glad tidings, and eagerly
offered it to all mankind. And they that believed, as being enlightened
in mind, cheerfully received it, and keep the Feast in memory of the
Passion, and make the moment of death an opportunity for entertainment
and festivity. For the close connexion with it of the resurrection does
away with the sadness of death, and becomes a pledge for the
resurrection of all. After just now taking part in this celebration, we
send you these tidings of the feast as though they were some fragrant
perfume, and salute your piety.
