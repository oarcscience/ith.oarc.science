<span id="iv.viii.i.xxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.i.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXII</span>.—*Conversion of the
Indians* <span id="fr_412"></span>[413](#fn_412.md) .

<span id="iv.viii.i.xxiii-p3"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.i.xxiii-p3.1"></span>At</span> this period, the light of the
knowledge of God was for the first time shed upon India. The courage and
the piety of the emperor had become celebrated throughout the world; and
the barbarians, having learnt by experience to choose peace rather than
war, were able to enjoy intercourse with one another without fear. Many
persons, therefore, set out on long journeys; some for the desire of
making discoveries, others from a spirit of commercial enterprise. About
this period a native of Tyre <span id="fr_413"></span>[414](#fn_413.md) ,
acquainted with Greek philosophy, desiring to penetrate into the
interior of India, set off for this purpose with his two young nephews.
When he had accomplished the object of his wishes, he embarked for his
own country. The ship being compelled to put in to land in order to
obtain a fresh supply of water, the barbarians fell upon her, drowned
some of the crew, and took the others prisoners. The uncle was among the
number of those who were killed, and the lads were conducted to the
king. The name of the one was Ædesius, and of the other Frumentius. The
king of the country, in course of time, perceiving their intelligence,
promoted them to the superintendence of his household. If any one should
doubt the truth of this account, let him recall to mind the history of
Joseph in the kingdom of Egypt, and also the history of Daniel, and of
the three champions of the truth, who, from being captives, became
princes of Babylon. The king died; but these young men remained with his
son, and were advanced to still greater power. As they had been brought
up in the true religion, they exhorted the merchants who visited the
country to assemble, according to the custom of Romans <span
id="fr_414"></span>[415](#fn_414.md) , to take part in the divine liturgy.
After a considerable time they solicited the king to reward their
services by permitting them to return to their own country. They
obtained his permission, and safely reached Roman territory. Ædesius
directed his course towards Tyre, but Frumentius, whose religious zeal
was greater than the natural feeling of affection for his relatives,
proceeded to Alexandria, and informed the bishop of that city that the
Indians were deeply anxious to obtain spiritual light. Athanasius then
held the rudder of that church; he heard the story, and then “Who,” said
he, “better than you yourself can scatter the mists of ignorance, and
introduce among this people the light of Divine preaching?” After having
said this, he conferred upon him the episcopal dignity, and sent him to
the spiritual culture of that nation. The newly-ordained bishop left
this country, caring nothing for the mighty ocean, and returned to the
untilled ground of his work. There, having the grace of God to labour
with him, he cheerfully and successfully played the husbandman, catching
those who sought to gainsay his words by works of apostolic wonder, and
thus, by these marvels, confirming his teaching, he continued each day
to take many souls alive <span id="fr_415"></span>[416](#fn_415.md) .

<span id="iv.viii.i.xxiii-p2"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.viii.i.xxiii-p2.1"></span>Περι τῆς ᾽Ινδῶν πίστεως</span>. The
term “India” is used vaguely, partly from the old belief that Asia and
Africa joined somewhere south of the Indian Ocean. Here the Indians are
Abyssinians.

<span id="fn_413"></span>[58:414](2030043.htm#fr_413.md) <span
id="iv.viii.i.xxiii-p3.2"></span>

<span id="iv.viii.i.xxiii-p4"></span> The version adopted by Rufinus,
the earliest extant authority for this story, is followed, in the main,
by Socrates, Sozomen, and Theodoret. The Tyrian traveller is named
Meropius.

<span id="fn_414"></span>[58:415](2030043.htm#fr_414.md) <span
id="iv.viii.i.xxiii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="iv.viii.i.xxiii-p5"></span> The words of Sozomen (ii. 24)
corresponding with the passage in which Rufinus (i. 9) speaks of meeting
“romano ritu orationis caussa,” are <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.viii.i.xxiii-p5.1"></span>ᾗ</span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.viii.i.xxiii-p5.2"></span>ῥωμαίοις ἔθος ἐκκλησιάζειν</span>, i.e.
to assemble to worship after the manner civilized citizens of the
Empire, and not like savages. The expression has nothing to do with the
customs of the Church of Rome, in the later sense of the word, as has
sometimes been represented. Cf. Soc. I. 19, <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.viii.i.xxiii-p5.3"></span>τὰς χριστιανικὰς ἐκτελεῖν εὐχάς</span>

<span id="fn_415"></span>[58:416](2030043.htm#fr_415.md) <span
id="iv.viii.i.xxiii-p5.4"></span>

<span id="iv.viii.i.xxiii-p6"></span> “The king, if we identify the
narrative with the Ethiopian version of the story, must have been the
father of the Abreha and Atzbeha of the Ethiopian annals.” “Frumentius
received the title of Abbana, or Abba Salama” (cf. Absalom), “the Father
of Peace.” “The bishopric of Auxume” (Axum, about 100 miles S.W. of
Massowah) “assumed a metropolitan character.” (Dict. of Christ. Biog.,
Art. Ethiopian Church). Constantius afterwards wrote to the Ethiopian
Prince to ask him to replace Frumentius by Theophilus, an Arian, but
without success (Ath. Ap. ad Const. 31).
