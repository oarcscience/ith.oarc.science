<span id="iv.x.cxxx-p1"></span> *CXXIX. To Magnus Antoninus the
Presbyter.* <span id="fr_1934"></span>[1935](#fn_1934.md)

<span id="iv.x.cxxx-p3"></span>Sailors at night are cheered by the sight
of the harbour lights, and so are they who are in peril for the sake of
the apostolic faith by the zeal of them that share the faith. We have
great comfort in what we hear of your godliness’s efforts on behalf of
the divine doctrines, for this mind has been given you by the Giver of
all good gifts and for the safe keeping of these doctrines you undergo
every toil. Now I, comforted by your zeal, make an insignificant return,
calling on you to persevere in your divine labours, to despise your
adversaries as an easy prey, (for what is weaker than they who are
destitute of the truth?) and to trust in Him who said “I will not fail
thee nor forsake thee,” <span id="fr_1935"></span>[1936](#fn_1935.md) and
“Lo I am with you alway even unto the end of the world.” <span
id="fr_1936"></span>[1937](#fn_1936.md) Help me too with your prayers that
I may confidently say “The Lord is on my side; I will not fear: what can
man do unto me?” <span id="fr_1937"></span>[1938](#fn_1937.md)

<span id="iv.x.cxxx-p2"></span> Garnerius supposes that this Antoninus
is the same as the Antoninus mentioned as living in Theodoret’s
Religious History and thinks that the Solitary may have become an
Archimandrite after 445 when the Religious History was written, but the
<span class="c14"><span id="iv.x.cxxx-p2.1"></span>mss.</span> vary as
to the superscription of the letter, which may be addressed to Magnus,
Antonius and others.
