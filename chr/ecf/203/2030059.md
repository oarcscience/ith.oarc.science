id="iv.viii.ii.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V</span>.—*The Heresy of
Macedonius*.

<span id="iv.viii.ii.v-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.ii.v-p2.1"></span>The</span> Arians, having effected the
death of Paulus, or rather having despatched him to the kingdom of
heaven, promoted Macedonius <span id="fr_464"></span>[465](#fn_464.md) in
his place, who, they imagined, held the same sentiments, and belonged to
the same faction as themselves, because he, like them, blasphemed the
Holy Ghost. But, shortly after, they deposed him also, because he
refused to call Him a creature Whom the Holy Scriptures affirm to be the
Son of God. After his separation from them, he became the leader of a
sect of his own. He taught that the Son of God is not of the same
substance as the Father, but that He is like Him in every particular. He
also openly affirmed that the Holy Ghost is a creature. These
circumstances occurred not long afterwards as we have narrated them.

iii. 3. Paulus was murdered in 350 or 351, and the “shortly after” of
the text means nine years, Macedonius being replaced by Eudoxius of
Antioch, in 360. On how far the heresy of the “Pneumatomachi,” called
Macedonianism, was really due to the teaching of Macedonius, vide
Robertson’s *Church Hist.* II. iv. for reff.
