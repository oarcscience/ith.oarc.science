id="v.iii.lxxxii-p2.1"></span>Firmianus</span>, <span
id="fr_2499"></span>[2500](#fn_2499.md) known also as Lactantius, a
disciple of Arnobius, during the reign of Diocletian summoned to
Nicomedia with Flavius the Grammarian whose poem *On medicine* is still
extant, taught rhetoric there and on account of his lack of pupils
(since it was a Greek city) he betook himself to writing. We have a
*Banquet* of his which he wrote as a young man in Africa and an
*Itinerary* of a journey from Africa to Nicomedia written in hexameters,
and another book which is called *The Grammarian* and a most beautiful
one *On the wrath of God,* and *Divine institutes against the nations,*
seven books, and an *Epitome* of the same work in one volume, without a
title, <span id="fr_2500"></span>[2501](#fn_2500.md) also two books *To
Asclepiades,* one book *On persecution,* four books of Epistles to
Probus, two books of *Epistles to Severus,* two books of *Epistles to
his pupil Demetrius* <span id="fr_2501"></span>[2502](#fn_2501.md) and one
book to the same *On the work of God or the creation of man.* In his
extreme old age he was tutor to Crispus Cæsar a son of Constantine in
Gaul, the same one who was afterwards put to death by his father.
