id="v.iv.xxvii-p2.1"></span>Isaac <span
id="fr_2616"></span>[2617](#fn_2616.md) </span> wrote *On the Holy Trinity*
and a book *On the incarnation of the Lord,* writing in a very obscure
style of argument and involved language, maintaining that three persons
exist in one Deity, in such wise that any thing may be peculiar to each
which another does not have, that is to say, that the Father has this
peculiarity that He, himself without source, is the source of others,
that the Son has this peculiarity, that, begotten, He is not posterior
to the begetter, that the Holy Spirit has this peculiarity, that He is
neither made nor begotten but nevertheless is from another. Of the
incarnation of the Lord indeed, he writes that the person of the Son of
God is believed to be one, while yet there are two natures existing in
him.
