id="v.iii.xiv-p2.1"></span>Lucius Annæus Seneca <span
id="fr_2394"></span>[2395](#fn_2394) </span> of Cordova, disciple of the
Stoic Sotion <span id="fr_2395"></span>[2396](#fn_2395) and uncle of
Lucan the Poet, was a man of most continent life, whom I should not
place in the category of saints were it not that those *Epistles of Paul
to Seneca and Seneca* <span id="fr_2396"></span>[2397](#fn_2396) *to
Paul,* which are read by many, provoke me. In these, written when he was
tutor of Nero and the most powerful man of that time, he says that he
would like to hold such a place among his countrymen as Paul held among
Christians. He was put to death by Nero two years before Peter and Paul
were crowned with martyrdom.
