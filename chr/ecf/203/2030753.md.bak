<span id="vi.xii.i.xv-p1"></span> 14. It is said that on a recent
occasion where the letters of Theophilus exposing the errors of Origen
were read, our friend stopped his ears, and along with all present
pronounced a distinct condemnation upon the author of so much evil; and
that he said that up to that moment he had never known that Origen had
written anything so wrong. I say nothing against this: I do not make the
observation which perhaps another might make, that it was impossible for
him to be ignorant of that which he had himself translated, and an
apology for which by a heretic he had published under the name of a
martyr, whose defence also he had undertaken in his own book; as to
which I shall have some adverse remarks to make later on if I have time
to write them. I only make one observation which does not admit of
contradiction. If it is possible that he should have misunderstood what
he translated, why is it not possible that I should have been ignorant
of the book <span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xii.i.xv-p1.1"></span>Περὶ
᾽Αρχῶν</span> which I had not before read, and that I should have only
read those Homilies which I translated, and in which he himself
testifies that there is nothing wrong? But if, contrary to his expressed
opinion, he now finds fault with me for those things for which he before
had given me praise, he will be in a strait between two; either he
praised me, believing me to be a heretic but confessing that he shared
my opinion; or else, if he praised me before as orthodox, his present
accusations come to nothing, and are due to sheer malice. But perhaps it
was only as my friend that he formerly was silent about my errors, and
now that he is angry with me brings to light what he had concealed.

report.](2030754.md)
