id="v.iii.xxxix-p2.1"></span>Rhodo</span>, <span
id="fr_2441"></span>[2442](#fn_2441.md) a native of Asia, instructed in the
Scriptures at Rome by Tatian whom we mentioned above, published many
things especially a work *Against Marcion* in which he tells how the
Marcionites differ from one another as well as from the church and says
<span id="page_371">p. 371</span> <span
id="v.iii.xxxix-Page_371"></span>that the aged Apelles, another heretic,
was once engaged in a discussion with him, and that he, Rhodo, held
Apelles up to ridicule because he declared that he did not know the God
whom he worshipped. He mentioned in the same book, which he wrote to
Callistion, that he had been a pupil of Tatian at Rome. He also composed
elegant treatises *On the six days of creation* and a notable work
*against the Phrygians*. <span id="fr_2442"></span>[2443](#fn_2442.md) He
flourished in the reigns of Commodus and Severus.
