<span id="iv.viii.v.xxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.v.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIII</span>.—*Of Flavianus
bishop of Antioch and of the sedition which arose in the western Church
on account of Paulinus*.

<span id="iv.viii.v.xxiii-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.v.xxiii-p2.1"></span>At</span> Antioch the great Meletius
had been succeeded by Flavianus who, together with Diodorus, had
undergone great struggles for the salvation of the sheep. Paulinus had
indeed desired to receive the bishopric, but he was withstood by the
clergy on the ground that it was not right that Meletius at his death
should be succeeded by one who did not share his opinions, and that to
the care of the flock ought to be advanced he who was conspicuous for
many toils, and had run the risk of many perils for the sheeps’ sake.
Thus a lasting hostility arose among the Romans and the Egyptians
against the East, and the ill feeling was not even destroyed on the
death of Paulinus. After him when Evagrius had occupied his see,
hostility was still shewn to the great Flavianus, notwithstanding the
fact that the promotion of Evagrius was a violation of the law of the
Church, for he had been promoted by Paulinus alone in disregard of many
canons. For a dying bishop is not permitted to ordain another to take
his place, and all the bishops of a province are ordered to be convened;
again no ordination of a bishop is permitted to take place without three
bishops. Nevertheless they refused to take cognizance of any of these
laws, embraced the communion of Evagrius, and filled the ears of the
emperor with complaints against Flavianus, so that, being frequently
importuned, he summoned him to Constantinople, and ordered him to repair
to Rome.

<span id="iv.viii.v.xxiii-p3"></span>Flavianus, however, urged in reply
that it was now winter, and promised to obey the command in spring. He
then returned home. But when the bishops of Rome, not only the admirable
Damasus, but also Siricius his successor and Anastasius the successor of
Siricius, importuned the emperor more vehemently and represented that,
while he put down the rivals against his own authority, he suffered bold
rebels against the laws of Christ to maintain their usurped authority,
then he sent for him again and tried to force him to undertake the
journey to Rome. On this Flavianus <span id="page_149">p. 149</span>
<span id="iv.viii.v.xxiii-Page_149"></span>in his great wisdom spoke
very boldly, and said, “If, sir, there are some who accuse me of being
unsound in the faith, or of life and conversation unworthy of the
priesthood, I will accept my accusers themselves for judges, and will
submit to whatever sentence they may give. But if they are contending
about see and primacy I will not contest the point; I will not oppose
those who wish to take them; I will give way and resign my bishopric.
So, sir, give the episcopal throne of Antioch to whom you will.”

<span id="iv.viii.v.xxiii-p4"></span>The emperor admired his manliness
and wisdom, and bade him go home again, and tend the church committed to
his care.

<span id="iv.viii.v.xxiii-p5"></span>After a considerable time had
elapsed the emperor arrived at Rome, and once more encountered the
charges advanced by the bishops on the ground that he was making no
attempt to put down the tyranny of Flavianus. The emperor ordered them
to set forth the nature of the tyranny, saying that he himself was
Flavianus and had become his protector. The bishops rejoined that it was
impossible for them to dispute with the emperor. He then exhorted them
in future to join the churches in concord, put an end to the quarrel,
and quench the fires of an useless controversy. Paulinus, he pointed
out, had long since departed this life; Evagrius had been irregularly
promoted; the eastern churches accepted Flavianus as their bishop. Not
only the east but all Asia, Pontus, and Thrace were united in communion
with him, and all Illyricum recognised his authority over the oriental
bishops. In submission to these counsels the western bishops promised to
bring their hostility to a close and to receive the envoys who should be
sent them.

<span id="iv.viii.v.xxiii-p6"></span>When Flavianus had been informed of
this decision he despatched to Rome certain worthy bishops with
presbyters and deacons of Antioch, giving the chief authority among them
to Acacius bishop of Berœa, who was famous throughout the world. On the
arrival of Acacius and his party at Rome they put an end to the
protracted quarrel, and after a war of seventeen years <span
id="fr_898"></span>[899](#fn_898.md) gave peace to the churches. When the
Egyptians were informed of the reconciliation they too gave up their
opposition, and gladly accepted the agreement which was made.

<span id="iv.viii.v.xxiii-p8"></span>At that time Anastasius had been
succeeded in the primacy of the Roman Church by Innocent, a man of
prudence and ready wit. Theophilus, whom I have previously mentioned,
held the see of Alexandria. <span id="fr_899"></span>[900](#fn_899.md)
