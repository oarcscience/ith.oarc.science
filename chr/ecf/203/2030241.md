<span id="iv.x.lii-p1"></span> *LII. To Ibas, Bishop of Edessa*. <span
id="fr_1697"></span>[1698](#fn_1697)

<span id="iv.x.lii-p3"></span>It is, I think, of His providential care
for our common salvation that the God of all brings on some men certain
calamities, that chastisement may prove to be to them that have erred a
healing remedy; to virtue’s athletes an encouragement to constancy; and
to all who look on a beneficial exemplar. For it is natural that when we
see others punished we should be filled with fear ourselves. In view of
these considerations I look on the trouble of Africa as a general
advantage. In the first place when I bear in mind their former
prosperity and now look on their sudden overthrow, I see how variable
are all human affairs, and learn a twofold lesson;—not to rejoice in
felicity as though it would never come to an end, nor be distressed at
calamities as hard to bear. Then I recall the memory of past errors, and
tremble lest I fall into like sufferings. My main motive in now writing
to you is to introduce to your holiness the very God-<span
id="page_267">p. 267</span> <span id="iv.x.lii-Page_267"></span>beloved
bishop Cyprianus, <span id="fr_1698"></span>[1699](#fn_1698) who
starting from the famous Africa is now compelled, by the savagery of the
barbarians, to travel in foreign lands.

<span id="iv.x.lii-p5"></span>He has brought a letter to us from the
very holy bishop the lord Eusebius, <span
id="fr_1699"></span>[1700](#fn_1699) who wisely rules the Galatians.
When your piety has received him with your wonted kindness I beg you to
send him with a letter to whatever pious bishops you may think fit so
that while he enjoys their kindly consolation he may be the means of
their receiving heavenly and lasting benefits.
