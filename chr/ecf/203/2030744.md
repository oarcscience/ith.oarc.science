<span id="vi.xii.i.vi-p1"></span> 5. In the meantime, I desired to free
myself from suspicion in the implicit judgment of the reader, and to
refute the gravest of the charges in the eyes of my friends. I did not
wish it to appear that I had been the first to strike, seeing that I
have not, even when wounded, aimed a blow against my assailant, but have
only sought to heal my own wound. I beg the reader to let the blame rest
on him who struck the first blow, without respect of persons. He is not
content with striking; but, as if he were dealing with a man whom he had
reduced to silence and who would never speak again, he has written three
elaborate books and has made out from my works a list of
“Contradictions” worthy of Marcion. <span

at once what his doctrine is and what is this madness of mine which we
had not expected. Perhaps he has learnt (though the time for it has been
short) all that is necessary to make him my teacher, and a sudden flow
of eloquence will reveal what no one imagined that he knew.

grant.

<span id="vi.xii.i.vi-p7"></span>Let him begin the engagement hand to
hand.”

<span id="vi.xii.i.vi-p8"></span>Though he may brandish the spear of his
accusations and hurl them against us with all his might, we trust in the
Lord our Saviour that his truth will encompass us as with a shield, and
we shall be able to sing with the Psalmist: <span
id="fr_3008"></span>[3009](#fn_3008.md) “Their blows have become as the
arrows of the little ones,” and <span
id="fr_3009"></span>[3010](#fn_3009.md) “Though an host should encamp
against me, my heart shall not fear; though war should rise against me,
even then will I be confident.” But of this at another time. Let us now
return to the point where we began.
