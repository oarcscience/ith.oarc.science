<span id="vi.xii.ii.x-p1"></span> 9. Before I enter upon the subject
matter of this passage, I must stand in admiration of words worthy of
Theophrastus:

<span id="vi.xii.ii.x-p2"></span>“I am informed, he says, that some stir
has been made on the question of the nature of the soul. Whether
complaints on a matter of this kind ought to be entertained instead of
being put aside, you must yourself decide.”

<span id="vi.xii.ii.x-p3"></span>If these questions as to the origin of
the soul have been stirred at Rome, what is the meaning of this
complaint and murmuring on the question whether they ought to be
entertained or not, a question which belongs entirely to the discretion
of bishops? But perhaps he thinks that question and complaint mean the
same thing, because he finds this form of speech in the Commentaries of
Caper. Then he writes: “Some of those whom I have read hold that the
soul is infused together with the material body through the channel of
the human seed; and of these they give such proofs as they can.” What
license have we here in the forms of speech! What mixing of the moods
and tenses! <span id="fr_3103"></span>[3104](#fn_3103.md) “I have read some
sayings—they confirmed them with what assertions they could.” And in
what follows: “Others assert that God is every day making new souls and
infusing them into the bodies which have been framed in the womb; while
others again believe that the souls were all made long ago when God made
all things of nothing, and that all that he now does is to send out each
soul to be born in its body as seems good to him.” Here also we have a
most beautiful arrangement. Some, he says, assert this and that; some
declare that the souls were made long ago, that is, when God made all
things of nothing, and that He now sends them forth to be born in their
own body as it pleases him. He speaks so distastefully and so confusedly
that I have more trouble in correcting his mistakes than he in writing
them. At the end he says: “I, however, though I have read these things;”
and, while the sentence still hangs unfinished, he adds, as if he had
brought forward something fresh: “I, however, do not deny that I have
both read each of these things, and as yet confess that I am ignorant.”

<span id="vi.xii.ii.x-p4"></span> The words are translated literally
here, so as to shew how they lend themselves to Jerome’s strictures.
