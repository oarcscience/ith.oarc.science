id="fr_2493"></span>[2494](#fn_2493) </span> the presbyter, patron of
Eusebius bishop of Cæsarea, was so inflamed with love of sacred
literature, that he transcribed the greater part of the works of Origen
with his own hand and these are still preserved in the library at
Cæsarea. I have twenty-five volumes <span
id="fr_2494"></span>[2495](#fn_2494) of Commentaries of Origen, written
in his hand, *On the twelve prophets* which I hug and guard with such
joy, that I deem myself to have the wealth of Croesus. And if it is such
joy to have one epistle of a martyr how much more to have so many
thousand lines which seem to me to be traced in his blood. He wrote an
*Apology for Origen* before Eusebius had written his and was put to
death at Cæsarea in Palestine in the persecution of Maximinus.
