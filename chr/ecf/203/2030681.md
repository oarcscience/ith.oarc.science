<span id="vi.xi.ii.xliv"></span>

<span id="vi.xi.ii.xliv-p1"></span> 42. I have given you one instance in
which he has expressed his own opinion without any ambiguity on the
universal resurrection. I will give one more, and with this bring to an
end the first book of my Apology. His statements, indeed, on this point
are innumerable. The one I select is on the passage where it is
written: <span id="fr_2911"></span>[2912](#fn_2911.md) “From whom all the
body, fitly framed and knit together through that which every joint
supplieth according to the working in due measure of each several part,
maketh the increase of the body unto the building up of itself in love.”
He begins thus:

<span id="vi.xi.ii.xliv-p3"></span>“In the end of all things, when we
shall have begun to know God face to face, and shall have come to the
measure of the age <span id="fr_2912"></span>[2913](#fn_2912.md) of the
fulness of Christ, of whose fulness we all have received, <span
id="fr_2913"></span>[2914](#fn_2913.md) so that Christ will not be in us in
part but wholly, and, leaving the rudiments of babes, we shall have
grown into the perfect man, of whom the Prophet says, <span
id="fr_2914"></span>[2915](#fn_2914.md) “Behold the man whose name is the
East,” and whom John the Baptist announces in the words: <span
id="fr_2915"></span>[2916](#fn_2915.md) “After me cometh a man who has come
to be <span id="fr_2916"></span>[2917](#fn_2916.md) before me, for he was
before me”; then by the concurrence in a common faith, and in a common
recognition of the Son of God, whom now through the variety of men’s
minds we cannot know and recognize with one and the same faith, the
whole body, which before had been disintegrated and torn into many
parts, will be joined and fitted together, and brought into one; so that
there will be but one administration, and <span id="page_458">p.
458</span> <span id="vi.xi.ii.xliv-Page_458"></span>one and the same
operation, and an absolute perfection of the one age, <span
id="fr_2917"></span>[2918](#fn_2917.md) whereby the whole body will grow
equally, and all its members according to their measure will receive an
increase of age. But this whole process of up-building, by which the
body of the church is increased in all its members, will be completed by
mutual love. We can understand the whole mass of rational creatures by
the example of a single rational animal; and whatever we say of the
single creature, we may be sure will be applicable to every creature.
Let us imagine this creature, then, to have had all its limbs, veins and
flesh so torn apart that neither bone should cleave to bone nor muscle
be joined to muscle, that the eyes lie in one place apart, the nose in
another, that the hands are placed here and the feet thrown out there,
and the rest of the members are in a similar way dispersed and divided.
Then let us suppose that a physician arrives on the spot, of such skill
as to be able to imitate the acts of Æsculapius, as told in the stories
of the heathen, and to raise up a new form, the new man Virbius. <span
id="fr_2918"></span>[2919](#fn_2918.md) It will be necessary for him to
restore each member to its own place, to couple joint to joint, and to
replace the various parts and glue them together, so as to make the body
one again. So far this single comparison has carried us. But now let us
take another typical case, so as, by a similar illustration to make
clear that which we wish to have understood. A child is growing up;
moment by moment, though the process is hidden from us, he is tending to
perfect maturity. His hands enlarge, his feet undergo a proportional
increase; the belly, though we cannot see it, is filled, the shoulders
widen unmarked by the eyes, and all the members in each part grow
according to their measure, but in such a way that they evidently
increase not for themselves but for the body. So will it be in the time
of the restitution of all things, when the true physician Jesus Christ,
shall come to restore to health the whole body of the church which is
now dispersed and torn. Every one, according to the measure of his faith
and his recognition of the Son of God (it is called recognition because
he first knew him and afterwards ceased from knowing him), will receive
his proper place, and will begin to be what he once had been: not that,
according to another opinion which is a heresy, <span
id="fr_2919"></span>[2920](#fn_2919.md) all will be placed in one
condition, <span id="fr_2920"></span>[2921](#fn_2920.md) that is, all
restored to the condition of Angels, but that every member will be
perfected according to its measure and office: for instance, that the
apostate angel will begin to be that which he was originally made, and
man who had been cast out of the garden of Eden will be brought back to
cultivate the garden again. But all these things will be so constituted
that they will be joined to one another by mutual love, each member
rejoicing with its fellow and being gladdened by its advancement; and so
the church of the first born, the body of Christ, will dwell in the
heavenly Jerusalem which the Apostle in another place calls the mother
of the Saints.”
