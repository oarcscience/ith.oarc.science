<span id="iv.viii.v.xxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.v.xxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVI</span>.—*Of Honorius the
emperor and Telemachus the monk*.

<span id="iv.viii.v.xxvi-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.v.xxvi-p2.1"></span>Honorius</span>, who inherited the
empire of Europe, put a stop to the gladiatorial combats which had long
been held at Rome. The occasion of his doing so arose from the following
circumstance. A certain man of the name of Telemachus had embraced the
ascetic life. He had set out from the East and for this reason had
repaired to Rome. There, when the abominable spectacle was being
exhibited, he went himself into the stadium, and, stepping down into the
arena, endeavoured to stop the men who were wielding their weapons
against one another. The spectators of the slaughter were indignant, and
inspired by the mad fury of the demon who delights in those bloody
deeds, stoned the peacemaker to death.

<span id="iv.viii.v.xxvi-p3"></span>When the admirable emperor was
informed of this he numbered Telemachus in the array of victorious
martyrs, and put an end to that impious spectacle.
