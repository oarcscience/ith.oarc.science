<span id="iv.x.lxxxiii"></span>

<span id="iv.x.lxxxiii-p1"></span> *LXXXIII. Of Theodoretus, Bishop of
Cyrus, to Dioscorus, Archbishop of Alexandria.*

<span id="iv.x.lxxxiii-p2"></span>To them that suffer under false
accusation the greatest comfort is given by the words of Scripture. When
such a sufferer is wounded by the lying words of an unbridled tongue,
and feels the sharp stings of distress, he remembers the story of the
admirable Joseph, and as he beholds that model of chastity, an exemplar
of every kind of virtue, suffering, under a calumnious charge,
imprisoned and fettered for invading another man’s bed, and spending a
long time in a dungeon, his pain is lightened by the remedy that the
story furnishes. So again when he finds the gentle David, hunted as a
tyrant by Saul, and then catching his enemy and letting him go unharmed,
an anodyne is given him in his distress. But when he sees the Lord
Christ Himself, Maker of the ages, Creator of all things, very God, and
Son of the very God, called a gluttonous man and a wine bibber by the
wicked Jews, it is not only consolation but rather great joy that is
given him in that he is deemed worthy of sharing the sufferings of the
Lord.

<span id="iv.x.lxxxiii-p3"></span><span id="page_279">p. 279</span>
<span id="iv.x.lxxxiii-Page_279"></span>Thus I was compelled to write
when I read the letters of your holiness to the most pious and sacred
archbishop Domnus, for there was contained in them the statement that
certain men have come to the illustrious city administered by your
holiness, and have accused me of dividing the one Lord Jesus Christ into
two sons, and this when preaching at Antioch, where innumerable hearers
swell the congregation. I wept for the men who had the hardihood to
contrive the vain calumny against me. But I grieved, and, my Lord,
forgive me, forced as I am by pain to speak, that your pious excellency
did not reserve one ear unbiassed for me instead of believing the lies
of my accusers. Yet they were but three or four or about a dozen while I
have countless hearers to testify to the orthodoxy of my teaching. Six
years I continued teaching in the time of Theodotus bishop of Antioch,
of blessed and sacred memory, who was famous alike for his distinguished
career and for his knowledge of the divine doctrines. Thirteen years I
taught in the time of bishop John of sacred and blessed memory, who was
so delighted at my discourses as to raise both his hands and again and
again to start up: your holiness in your own letters has borne witness
how, brought up as he was from boyhood with the divine oracles, the
knowledge which he had of the divine doctrines was most exact. Besides
these this is the seventh year of the most pious lord archbishop
Domnus. <span id="fr_1764"></span>[1765](#fn_1764.md) Up to this present
day, after the lapse of so long a time, not one of the pious bishops,
not one of the devout clergy has ever at any time found any fault with
my utterances. And with how much gratification Christian people hear our
discourses your godly excellency can easily learn, alike from those who
have travelled thence hither, and from those who reached your city from
us.

<span id="iv.x.lxxxiii-p5"></span>All this I say not for the sake of
boasting, but because I am forced to defend myself. It is not the fame
of my sermons to which I am calling attention; it is their orthodoxy
alone. Even the great teacher of the world who is wont to style himself
last of saints and first of sinners, that he might stop the mouths of
liars was compelled to set forth a list of his own labours; and in
shewing that this account of his sufferings was of necessity, not of
free will, he added “I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled
me.” <span id="fr_1765"></span>[1766](#fn_1765.md) I own myself
wretched—aye thrice wretched. I am guilty of many errors. Through faith
alone I look for finding some mercy in the day of the Lord’s appearing.
I wish and I pray that I may follow the footprints of the holy Fathers,
and I earnestly desire to keep undefiled the evangelic teaching which
was in sum delivered to us by the holy Fathers assembled in council at
the Bithynian Nicæa. I believe that there is one God the Father and one
Holy Ghost proceeding from the Father: <span
id="fr_1766"></span>[1767](#fn_1766.md) so also that there is one Lord
Jesus Christ, only begotten Son of God, begotten of the Father before
all ages, brightness of His glory and express image of the Father’s
person, <span id="fr_1767"></span>[1768](#fn_1767.md) on account of man’s
salvation, incarnate and made man and born of Mary the Virgin in the
flesh. For so are we taught by the wise Paul “Whose are the Fathers and
of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God
blessed for ever. Amen,” <span id="fr_1768"></span>[1769](#fn_1768.md) and
again “Concerning His Son Jesus Christ our Lord which was made of the
seed of David according to the flesh and declared to be the Son of God
with power according to the spirit of holiness.” <span
id="fr_1769"></span>[1770](#fn_1769.md) On this account we also call the
holy Virgin “Theotokos,” <span id="fr_1770"></span>[1771](#fn_1770.md) and
deem those who object to this appellation to be alienated from true
religion.

<span id="iv.x.lxxxiii-p12"></span>In the same manner we call those men
corrupt and exclude them from the assembly of the Christians, who divide
our one Lord Jesus Christ into two persons or two sons or two Lords, for
we have heard the very divine Paul saying “One Lord, one faith, one
baptism” <span id="fr_1771"></span>[1772](#fn_1771.md) and again “One Lord
Jesus Christ by Whom are all things” <span
id="fr_1772"></span>[1773](#fn_1772.md) and again “Jesus Christ the same
yesterday and to-day and for ever” <span
id="fr_1773"></span>[1774](#fn_1773.md) and in another place—“He that
descended is the same also that ascended up far above all
heavens.” <span id="fr_1774"></span>[1775](#fn_1774.md) And countless other
passages of this kind may be found in the Apostle’s writings,
proclaiming the one Lord.

<span id="iv.x.lxxxiii-p17"></span>So too the divine Evangelist
exclaims, “And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld
His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of
grace and truth.” <span id="fr_1775"></span>[1776](#fn_1775.md)

<span id="iv.x.lxxxiii-p19"></span>And his namesake exclaimed, “After me
cometh one who is preferred before me for He was before me.” <span
id="fr_1776"></span>[1777](#fn_1776.md) And when he had shewn one person,
he expressed both the divine and the human, for the words “man” and
“comes” are human, but the phrase “He was before me” expresses the
divine. But <span id="page_280">p. 280</span> <span
id="iv.x.lxxxiii-Page_280"></span>nevertheless he did not recognise a
distinction between Him who came after and Him who was before, but owned
the same being to be eternal as God, but born man, after himself, of the
Virgin.

<span id="iv.x.lxxxiii-p21"></span>Thus too, the thrice blessed Thomas,
when he had put his hand on the flesh of the Lord, called Him Lord and
God, saying “My Lord and my God.” <span
id="fr_1777"></span>[1778](#fn_1777.md) For through the visible nature he
discerned the invisible.

<span id="iv.x.lxxxiii-p23"></span>So do we know no difference between
the same flesh and the Godhead but we own God the Word made man to be
one Son.

<span id="iv.x.lxxxiii-p24"></span>These lessons we have learnt alike
from the holy Scripture and from the holy Fathers who have expounded it,
Alexander and Athanasius, loud voiced heralds of the truth, who have
been ornaments of your apostolic see; from Basil and from Gregory and
the rest of the lights of the world; and that, in our endeavour to shut
the mouths of them that dare to oppose the blessed Theophilus and Cyril,
we use their works, our own writings testify. For we are most anxious by
the medicines supplied by very holy men to heal them that deny the
distinction between the Lord’s flesh and the Godhead, and who maintain
at one moment that the divine nature was changed into flesh, and at
another that the flesh was transmuted into nature of Godhead.

<span id="iv.x.lxxxiii-p25"></span>For they clearly instruct us in the
distinction between the two natures, and proclaim the immutability of
the divine nature, calling the flesh of the Lord divine as being made
flesh of God the Word; but the doctrine that it was transmuted into
nature of Godhead they repudiate as impious.

<span id="iv.x.lxxxiii-p26"></span>I think that your excellency is well
aware that Cyril of blessed memory often wrote to me, and when he sent
his books against Julian to Antioch, and in like manner his book on the
scapegoat, he asked the blessed John, bishop of Antioch, to shew them to
the great teachers of the East; and in compliance with this request the
blessed John sent us the books. I read them with admiration, and I wrote
to Cyril of blessed memory; and he wrote back to me praising my
exactitude and kindness. This letter I have preserved.

<span id="iv.x.lxxxiii-p27"></span>That I twice subscribed the writings
of John of blessed memory concerning Nestorius my own hand bears
witness, but this is the kind of thing whispered about me by men who try
to conceal their own unsoundness by calumniating me.

<span id="iv.x.lxxxiii-p28"></span>Therefore I implore your holiness to
turn your back on the liars; to give heed to the Church’s quiet and
either to heal by salutary medicines them that are trying to destroy the
doctrines of the truth, or, if they refuse to accept your treatment, to
expel them from the fold, to the end that the sheep may be spared from
contagion. I beg you to give me your customary salutation. That I have
written you my true sentiments is proved by my works on the holy
Scriptures and against the Arians and Eunomians.

<span id="iv.x.lxxxiii-p29"></span>I will in addition write yet a brief
word. If any one refuses to confess the holy Virgin to be “Theotokos,”
or calls our Lord Jesus Christ bare man, or divides into two sons Him
who is one only begotten and first born of every creature, I pray that
he may fall from hope in Christ, and let all the people say amen, amen.

<span id="iv.x.lxxxiii-p30"></span>Now that I have thus spoken, deign,
my lord, to give me your sacred prayers, and to cheer me by a letter in
reply telling me that your holiness has turned your back on my accusers.

<span id="iv.x.lxxxiii-p31"></span>I and my household salute all thy
brotherhood in piety in Christ.
