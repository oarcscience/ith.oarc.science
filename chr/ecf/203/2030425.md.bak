id="fr_2450"></span>[2451](#fn_2450.md) a Roman senator under the emperor
Commodus, having been denounced by a slave as a Christian, gained
permission to give a reason for his faith and wrote a remarkable volume
which he read in the senate, yet none the less, by the will of the
senate, he was beheaded for Christ by virtue of an ancient law among
them, that Christians who had once been brought before their judgment
seat should not be dismissed unless they recanted.
