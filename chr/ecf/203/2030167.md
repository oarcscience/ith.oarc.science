<span id="iv.viii.v.xxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.v.xxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVII</span>.—*Of the piety of
the emperor Arcadius and the ordination of John Chrysostom.*

<span id="iv.viii.v.xxvii-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.v.xxvii-p2.1"></span>On</span> the death at Constantinople
of Nectarius, bishop of that see, Arcadius, who had succeeded to the
Eastern empire, summoned John, the great luminary of the world. He had
heard that he was numbered in the ranks of the presbyterate, and now
issued orders to the assembled bishops to confer on him divine grace,
and appoint him shepherd of that mighty city. <span
id="fr_906"></span>[907](#fn_906)

<span id="iv.viii.v.xxvii-p7"></span>This fact is alone sufficient to
show the emperor’s care for divine things. At the same time the see of
Antioch was held by Flavianus, and that of Laodicea by Elpidius, who had
formerly been the comrade of the great Meletius, and had received the
impress of his life and conversation more plainly than wax takes the
impression of a seal ring. <span id="fr_907"></span>[908](#fn_907)

<span id="iv.viii.v.xxvii-p9"></span>He succeeded the great
Pelagius; <span id="fr_908"></span>[909](#fn_908) and the divine
Marcellus <span id="fr_909"></span>[910](#fn_909) was followed by the
illustrious Agapetus <span id="fr_910"></span>[911](#fn_910) whom I have
already described as conspicuous for high ascetic virtue. In the time of
the tempest of heresy, of Seleucia ad Taurum, Maximus, <span
id="fr_911"></span>[912](#fn_911) the companion of the great John, was
bishop, and of Mopsuestia Theodorus, <span
id="fr_912"></span>[913](#fn_912) both illustrious teachers.
Conspicuous, too, in wisdom and character was the holy Acacius, <span
id="fr_913"></span>[914](#fn_913) bishop of Berœa.

<span id="iv.viii.v.xxvii-p16"></span>Leontius, <span
id="fr_914"></span>[915](#fn_914) a shining example of many virtues,
tended the flock of the Galatians.

<span id="iv.viii.v.xxvii-p3"></span> Nectarius died in Sept. 397, and
John Chrysostom was appointed in Feb. 398. cf. Soc. vi. 2 and Soz. viii.
2.

<span id="iv.viii.v.xxvii-p4"></span>“The only difficulty lay with
Chrysostom himself and the people of Antioch. The double danger of a
decided *‘nolo episcopari’* on Chrysostom’s part, and of a public
commotion when the Antiocheans heard of the intention of robbing them of
their favourite preacher was overcome by stratagem. Asterius, the *Comes
Orientis,* in accordance with instructions received from Eutropius,
induced Chrysostom to accompany him to a martyr’s chapel outside the
city walls. There he was apprehended by the officers of the government,
and conveyed to Papae, the first post station on the road to
Constantinople. His remonstrances were unheeded; his enquiries met with
obstinate silence. Placed in a public chariot, and hurried on under a
military escort from stage to stage, the 800 miles traversed with the
utmost dispatch, the future bishop reached his imperial see a closely
guarded prisoner. However unwelcome the dignity thrust on him was,
Chrysostom, knowing that resistance was useless, felt it more dignified
to submit without further struggle.”

<span id="iv.viii.v.xxvii-p5"></span>

<span id="iv.viii.v.xxvii-p6"></span>“Chrysostom was consecrated
February 26th <span class="c14"><span
id="iv.viii.v.xxvii-p6.1"></span>a.d.</span> 398, in the presence of a
vast multitude assembled not only to witness the ceremony but also to
listen to the inaugural sermon of one of whose eloquence they had heard
so much. This *‘sermo enthronisticus’* is lost.” Dict. Christ. Biog.
s.v. “Chrysostom.”

<span id="iv.viii.v.xxvii-p8"></span> Elpidius, possibly a kind of
domestic chaplain (<span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.viii.v.xxvii-p8.1"></span>σύσκηνος</span>) to Meletius, was
afterwards a warm friend and advocate of Chrysostom. In 406 he was
deposed and imprisoned for three years, and not restored till 414.
