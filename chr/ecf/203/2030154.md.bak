<span id="iv.viii.v.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.v.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIV</span>.—*Of the information
given by Maximus the tyrant to Valentinianus*.

<span id="iv.viii.v.xiv-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.v.xiv-p2.1"></span>After</span> a considerable time
Maximus <span id="fr_865"></span>[866](#fn_865.md) was informed of the
attacks which were being made upon the loud-voiced herald of the truth,
and he sent dispatches to Valentinianus charging him to put a stop to
his war against true religion and exhorting him not to abandon his
father’s faith. In the event of his advice being disregarded he further
threatened war, and confirmed what he wrote by what he did, <span
id="fr_866"></span>[867](#fn_866.md) for he mustered his forces and marched
for Milan where Valentinianus was then residing. When the latter heard
of his approach he fled into Illyri<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>
<span id="iv.viii.v.xiv-Page_142"></span>cum. <span
id="fr_867"></span>[868](#fn_867.md) He had learnt by experience what good
he had got by following his mother’s advice.

<span id="iv.viii.v.xiv-p4"></span> The motives here stated seem to have
had little to do with the march of Maximus over the Alps. Indeed so far
from enthusiasm for Ambrose and the Ambrosian view of the faith being
conspicuous in the invader, he had received the bishop at Treves as
envoy from Valentinian, had refused to be diverted from his purpose, and
had moreover taken offence at the objection of Ambrose to communicate
with the bishops who had been concerned in the first capital punishment
of a heretic—i.e. Priscillian.
