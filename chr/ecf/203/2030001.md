<span id="iii-p2"></span>————————————

<span id="iii-p3"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iii-p3.1"></span>This</span> volume contains the following works:

<span id="iii-p4"></span>I. <span class="c14"><span
id="iii-p4.1"></span>Theodoret</span>: *Church History, Dialogues, and
Letters.* Translated, with ample Prolegomena and explanatory notes, by
the Rev. <span class="c14"><span id="iii-p4.2"></span>Blomfield
Jackson</span>, M.A., Rector of St. Bartholomew’s, Cripplegate, London.

<span id="iii-p5"></span>II. <span class="c14"><span
id="iii-p5.1"></span>Jerome</span> and <span class="c14"><span
id="iii-p5.2"></span>Gennadius</span>: *Lives of Illustrious Men.*
Translated, with introduction and notes, by <span class="c14"><span
id="iii-p5.3"></span>Ernest Cushing Richardson</span>, Ph.D., Librarian
of Princeton College.

<span id="iii-p6"></span>III. <span class="c14"><span
id="iii-p6.1"></span>Rufinus</span>: *Apology against Jerome,* and <span
class="c14"><span id="iii-p6.2"></span>Jerome</span>: *Apology in reply
to Rufinus;* <span class="c14"><span
id="iii-p6.3"></span>Rufinus</span>: *Commentary on the Apostles’
Creed,* and *Prefaces* to his translations of the Clementine
Recognitions, the Sayings of Xystus, Eusebius’s Church History, and
several of Origen’s works; translated, with notes, and an introduction
on the Life and Works of Rufinus by the Hon. and Rev. <span
class="c14"><span id="iii-p6.4"></span>Wm.</span> <span
class="c14"><span id="iii-p6.5"></span>Henry Fremantle</span>, M.A.,
Canon of Canterbury.

<span id="iii-p7"></span>The English reader has now, in the first three
volumes of this Library, a complete collection of the *historical*
writings of the Fathers, whose permanent value, as sources, is
universally acknowledged. Several of them have never before appeared in
English.

<span id="iii-p8"></span>The unavoidable delay in the publication of the
third volume has been very annoying to the general editors and
publishers, but the subscribers will be amply compensated by the
addition of the writings of Rufinus, which were not promised in the
prospectus.

<span id="iii-p9"></span>It is encouraging that this difficult and
costly enterprise is beginning to be duly appreciated by competent
judges on both sides of the Atlantic. It is especially gratifying to
read from a thorough patristic scholar of the Anglican Church such a
hearty commendation of the first volume (the work of two young American
divines), as appeared in “The Church Quarterly Review” for April, 1892.
We share in his hope (p. 125) that the labors of Dr. McGiffert and Dr.
Richardson will stimulate a new and critical edition of all the
historical works of Eusebius, after the model set by Bishop Lightfoot in
his *Apostolic Fathers,* and that one of the English University Presses
will consider it an honor to undertake the expense of publication.
