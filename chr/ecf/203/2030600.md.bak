<span id="v.iv.lxxxi-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="v.iv.lxxxi-p2.1"></span>Musaeus, <span
id="fr_2711"></span>[2712](#fn_2711.md) </span> presbyter of the church at
Marseilles, a man learned in Divine Scriptures and most accurate in
their interpretation, as well as master of an excellent scholastic
style, on the request of Saint Venerius the bishop, selected from Holy
Scriptures passages suited to the various feast days of the year, also
passages from the Psalms for responses suited to the season, and the
passages for reading. The readers in the church found this work of the
greatest value, in that it saved them trouble and anxiety in the
selection of passages, and was useful for the instruction of the people
as well as for the dignity of the service. He also addressed to Saint
Eustathius <span id="fr_2712"></span>[2713](#fn_2712.md) the bishop,
successor to the above mentioned man of God, an excellent and sizable
volume, a *Sacramentary,* <span id="fr_2713"></span>[2714](#fn_2713.md)
divided into various sections, according to the various offices and
seasons, Readings and Psalms, both for reading and chanting, but also
filled throughout with petitions to the Lord, <span
id="fr_2714"></span>[2715](#fn_2714.md) and thanksgiving for his benefits.
By this work we know him to have been a man of strong intelligence and
chaste eloquence. He is said to have also delivered homilies, which are,
as I know, valued by pious men, but which I have not read. He died in
the reign of Leo and Majorianus.
