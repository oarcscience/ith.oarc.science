<span id="vi.xiii.xl"></span>

<span id="vi.xiii.xl-p1"></span> 39. We come next in the order of belief
to the <span class="c14"><span id="vi.xiii.xl-p1.1"></span>Holy
Church</span>. We have mentioned above why the Creed does not say here,
as in the preceding article, “*In* the Holy Church.” They, therefore,
who were taught above to believe in one God, under the mystery of the
Trinity, must believe this also, that there is one holy Church in which
there is one faith and one baptism, in which is believed one God the
Father, and one Lord Jesus Christ, His Son, and one Holy Ghost. This is
that holy Church which is without spot or wrinkle. For many others have
gathered together Churches, as Marcion, and Valentinus, and Ebion, and
Manichæus, and Arius, and all the other heretics. But those Churches are
not without spot or wrinkle of unfaithfulness. And therefore the Prophet
said of them, “I hate the Church of the malignants, and I will not sit
with the ungodly.” <span id="fr_3405"></span>[3406](#fn_3405.md) But of
this Church which keeps the faith of Christ entire, hear what the Holy
Spirit says in the Canticles, “My dove is one; the perfect one of her
mother is one.” <span id="fr_3406"></span>[3407](#fn_3406.md) He then who
receives this faith in the Church let him not turn aside in the Council
of vanity, and let him not enter in with those who practise iniquity.

<span id="vi.xiii.xl-p4"></span>For Marcion’s assembly is a Council of
vanity in that he denies that the Father of Christ is God, the Creator,
who by His Son made the world. Ebion’s is a Council of vanity since he
teaches that, while we believe in Christ, we are withal to observe the
circumcision of the flesh, the keeping of the Sabbath, the accustomed
sacrifices, and all the other ordinances according to the letter of the
Law. Manichæus’ is a Council of vanity in regard of his teaching; first
in that he calls himself the Paraclete, then that he says that the world
was made by an evil God, denies God the Creator, rejects the Old
Testament, asserts two natures, one good the other evil, mutually
opposing one another, affirms that men’s souls are co-eternal with God,
that, according to the Pythagoreans, they return through divers circles
of nativity into cattle and animals and beasts, denies the resurrection
of our flesh, maintains that the passion and nativity of the Lord were
not in the verity of flesh, but only in appearance. It was the Council
of vanity when Paul of Samosata and his successor Photinus afterwards
taught, that Christ was not born of the Father before the world, but had
His beginning from Mary, and believed not that being God He was born
man, but that of <span id="page_559">p. 559</span> <span
id="vi.xiii.xl-Page_559"></span>man He was made God. It was the Council
of vanity when Arius and Eunomius taught as their determinate opinion
that the Son of God was not born of the very substance of the Father,
but was created out of nothing, and that the Son of God had a beginning,
and is inferior to the Father: moreover they affirm that the Holy Ghost
is not only inferior to the Son, but is also a ministering Spirit. <span
id="fr_3407"></span>[3408](#fn_3407.md) Theirs also is a Council of vanity
who confess indeed that the Son is of the substance of the Father, but
distinguish and separate the Holy Spirit, while yet the Saviour shews in
the Gospel that the power and Godhead of the Trinity are one and the
same, saying, “Baptize all nations in the Name of the Father, and of the
Son, and of the Holy Ghost,” <span id="fr_3408"></span>[3409](#fn_3408.md)
and it is plainly impious for man to put asunder what God hath joined
together. That also is the Council of vanity which a pertinacious and
wicked contention formerly gathered together, affirming that Christ
assumed human flesh indeed, but not a rational soul withal, since Christ
conferred one and the same salvation on the flesh, and the animal soul,
and the reason and mind of man. That also is the Council of vanity which
Donatus drew together throughout Africa, by charging the Church with
traditorship (delivering up the sacred books), and with which Novatus
disturbed men’s minds by denying the grant of repentance to the lapsed,
and condemning second marriages, though contracted possibly of
necessity. All of these then avoid as congregations of malignants. Those
also, if such there be, who are said to assert that the Son of God does
not see or know the Father, as Himself is known and seen by the Father;
or that the kingdom of Christ will have an end; or that the flesh will
not be raised in the complete restoration of its substance; these also
who deny that there will be a just judgment of God in respect of all,
and affirm that the devil will be absolved from the punishment of
damnation due to him. To all these, I say, let the believer turn a deaf
ear. But hold fast by the holy Church, which confesses God the Father
Almighty, and His only Son, Jesus Christ our Lord, and the Holy Ghost,
of one concordant and harmonious substance, believes that the Son of God
was born of the Virgin, suffered for man’s salvation, rose again from
the dead in the same flesh in which he was born; and, lastly, hopes that
He will come the Judge of all, through Whom also both the <span
class="c14"><span id="vi.xiii.xl-p6.3"></span>Forgiveness of Sins and
the Resurrection of the Flesh</span> are preached.
