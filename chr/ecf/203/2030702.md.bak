<span id="vi.xi.iii.xviii-p1"></span> 14. Take, again, the Preface to
the Song of Songs:

<span id="vi.xi.iii.xviii-p2"></span>“To the most holy Pope Damasus.
Origen in his other books has surpassed all other men: in the Song of
Songs he has surpassed himself. The work consists of eleven complete
volumes, and reaches a length of nearly twenty thousand lines. In these
he discusses first the version of the Septuagint; then those of Aquila,
Symmachus, and Theodotion, and last of all a Fifth Version which he
states that he discovered on the coast of Actium, and this he does so
grandly and so freely that it seems to me as if the words were fulfilled
in him which say, <span id="fr_2963"></span>[2964](#fn_2963.md) “The king
has brought me into his bedchamber.” It would require a vast amount of
time, of labour, and of money to translate a work so great and of so
much merit into the Latin language. I therefore leave it unattempted;
and have merely translated, and that without elegance, but correctly,
these two Tracts which he composed in ordinary language for babes and
sucklings. I give you a mere taste of his opinions, not a full meal; but
enough to make you realize what is the worth of his greater works, when
the smaller give you so much pleasure.”
