<span id="vi.xi.ii.xxvi-p1"></span> 25. But now let us go on to discuss
what he writes further as to God’s judgment, <span
id="fr_2864"></span>[2865](#fn_2864.md) for this too is a matter of the
faith. We shall find that as he alters the faith about the resurrection
of the flesh in other points, so he does in reference to God’s judgment.
In the first book of the Commentaries on the Ep. of Paul to the
Ephesians, he deals with that passage in which the Apostle says: “Even
as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world that we should
be holy and without blemish before him.” On this he says:

<span id="vi.xi.ii.xxvi-p3"></span>“For the foundation of the world the
Greek has <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xi.ii.xxvi-p3.1"></span>καταβολῆς κόσμου</span>. The word <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xi.ii.xxvi-p3.2"></span>καταβολή</span> does
not mean the same which we understand by foundation. We, therefore,
shall not attempt to render a word for a word, which is here impossible
on account of the poverty of our language and also the novelty of the
sense, and because, as some one has said, the Greeks have a larger
discourse and a happier tongue than ours. We must explain the force of
the word by some sort of periphrasis. <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xi.ii.xxvi-p3.3"></span>καταβολή</span> is properly used when
something is thrown down and is cast from a higher into a lower place,
or else when anything is taking its beginning. Hence those who lay the
first foundations of future houses are said <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xi.ii.xxvi-p3.4"></span>καταβεβληκέναι</span>, that is to have
thrown down the first foundations. Paul thus used the word to show that
God framed all things out of nothing: he assigned to Him not a creation
nor a building up, nor a making but a <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xi.ii.xxvi-p3.5"></span>καταβολή</span>, that is, a beginning of
a foundation. He wishes to show that there was not some other thing
antecedent to creatures, and out of which creatures were formed, as is
held by the Manichæans and other heretics, who begin with a maker and a
material, but that all things were made out of nothing. But, as to our
election to be holy and without blemish before him, that is, before God,
previously to the making of the world, of which the Apostle speaks, this
belongs to the foreknowledge of God, to whom all future things are as if
they were already done, and all things are known before they come into
being: as Paul is predestinated in the womb of his mother, and Jeremiah
before his birth is sanctified, chosen, and confirmed, and, as it type
of Christ, is sent to be a prophet of the nations.”

inquisitions. It seems here to mean the method which God follows in
distinguishing between individuals.
