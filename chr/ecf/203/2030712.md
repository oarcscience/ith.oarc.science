<span id="vi.xi.iii.xxviii-p1"></span> 24. The Preface is that for the
treatise of Didymus on the Holy Spirit. It is addressed to Paulinianus,
and is as follows.

<span id="vi.xi.iii.xxviii-p2"></span>“While I was an inhabitant of
Babylon, a settler in the land of the purple harlot, and lived under the
law of the Quirites, I attempted to write some poor stuff about the Holy
Spirit and dedicated the work to the Pontiff of that city. When on a
sudden that pot which Jeremiah saw after the almond rod <span
id="fr_2969"></span>[2970](#fn_2969) began to seethe from the face of
the North; and the whole senate of the Pharisees raised a clamour and no
mere imaginary scribe but the whole faction of the ignorant as if I had
declared war against them, laid their heads together against me. I
therefore returned with all speed to Jerusalem, like a man going back to
his home, and, after having lived in sight of the cottage of Romulus and
the Lupercal <span id="fr_2970"></span>[2971](#fn_2970) with its naked
games, I am now in sight of Mary’s inn and the Saviour’s cave. And so,
Paulinianus my dear brother, since the aforenamed Pontiff Damasus, who
had impelled me to undertake this work, now sleeps in the Lord, it is
here in Judea that I warble the song which I could not sing in a strange
land, provoked thereto by you and by Paula and Eustochium those
handmaids of Christ whom I revere, and aided by your prayers; for this
land which bore the Saviour is more august to me than that which bore
the man who slew his brother. <span id="fr_2971"></span>[2972](#fn_2971)
I have in the title ascribed the work to its true authors for I
preferred to be known as the translator of another man’s work than to
imitate certain people and, like the ungainly jackdaw, deck myself in
another bird’s plumage. I read some time ago the treatise of a certain
person on the Holy Spirit, and I recognized then, according to the
sentence of Terence, <span id="fr_2972"></span>[2973](#fn_2972) bad
things in Latin taken from good things in Greek. There is nothing in it
of close reasoning, nothing downright and manly, such as draws us into
assent even against our will, but all is flaccid and soft, sleek and
pretty, picked out with the rarest colours. But Didymus, <span
id="fr_2973"></span>[2974](#fn_2973) my own Didymus, who has the eyes of
the bride in the Song of Songs, those eyes which Jesus bade us lift up
upon the whitening fields, looks afar into the depths, and has once more
given us cause to call him, as is our wont, the Seer Prophet. Whoever
reads the work will recognize the plagiarisms of the Latins, and will
despise the derivative streams, as soon as he begins to drink at the
fountain head. He is rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; <span
id="fr_2974"></span>[2975](#fn_2974) his very style marks him as one
like the apostle as well by the grandeur of the sense as by the
simplicity of the words.”

each February in honour of Lupercus the god of fertility. Two noble
youths, after a sacrifice of goats and dogs, ran almost naked about the
city with thongs cut from the skins, a stroke from which was believed to
impart fertility to women.
