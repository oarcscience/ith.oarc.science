id="iv.viii.i.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIV</span>.—*Letter written by the
Emperor Constantine respecting the building of Churches* <span
id="fr_382"></span>[383](#fn_382.md) .

<span id="iv.viii.i.xv-p3"></span>“<span class="c14"><span
id="iv.viii.i.xv-p3.1"></span>Constantinus Augustus</span>, the great
and the victorious, to Eusebius.

<span id="iv.viii.i.xv-p4"></span>“I am well aware, and am thoroughly
convinced, my beloved brother, that as the servants of our Saviour
Christ have been suffering up to the present time from nefarious
machinations and tyrannical persecutions, the fabrics of all the
churches must have either fallen into utter ruin from neglect, or,
through apprehension of the impending iniquity, have been reduced below
their proper dignity. But now that freedom is restored, and that
dragon <span id="fr_383"></span>[384](#fn_383.md) , through the providence
of God, and by our instrumentality, thrust out from the government of
the Empire, I think that the divine power has become known to all, and
that those who hitherto, from fear or from incredulity or from
depravity, have lived in error, will now, upon becoming acquainted with
Him who truly is, be led into the true and correct manner of life. Exert
yourself, therefore, diligently in the reparation of the churches under
your own jurisdiction, and admonish the principal bishops, priests, and
deacons of other places to engage zealously in the same work; in order
that all the churches which still exist may be repaired or enlarged, and
that new ones may be built wherever they are required. You, and others
through your intervention, can apply to magistrates <span
id="fr_384"></span>[385](#fn_384.md) and to provincial governments <span
id="fr_385"></span>[386](#fn_385.md) , for all that may be necessary for
this purpose; for they have received written injunctions to render
zealous obedience to whatever your holiness may command. May God
preserve you, beloved brother.”

<span id="iv.viii.i.xv-p8"></span>Thus the emperor wrote to the bishops
in each province respecting the building of churches. From his letter to
Eusebius of Palestine, it is easily learnt what measures he adopted to
obtain copies of the Holy Bible <span id="fr_386"></span>[387](#fn_386.md)
