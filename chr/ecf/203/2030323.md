<span id="iv.x.cxxxiv-p1"></span> *CXXXIII. To John, Bishop of
Germanicia.* <span id="fr_1961"></span>[1962](#fn_1961.md)

<span id="iv.x.cxxxiv-p3"></span>I have always known, sir, that you are
not unmindful of our friendship. And it has ever been my wish and prayer
that your piety should give heed to exact truth, and shun the communion
of traitors to true religion, ascribing to the Supreme Ruler His care on
our behalf. For indeed, while I have been silent and inactive, He has
put an end to our very keen and terrible sufferings, and has replaced
the dire tempest by this bright calm. And now that the loving-kindness
of the Lord has granted us this blessing, I find the quiet of my retreat
indeed delightful, for I feel the necessity of persuading those who have
been led away by the slanders launched against me, and of both
convincing them of the truth of the teaching of the gospels, and
refuting the attack of falsehood. When once this refutation is finished,
and the victory of the truth is secured, it is my purpose to quit public
life, and withdraw to the rest that I so greatly long for. As to the
foes of the truth I cry with the prophet, “Their memorial is perished
with a noise, but the Lord shall endure for ever.” <span
id="fr_1962"></span>[1963](#fn_1962.md) As to ourselves, I sing with the
Psalmist, “He sent from above, He took me, He drew me out of many
waters, He delivered me from my strong enemy.” <span
id="fr_1963"></span>[1964](#fn_1963.md)

<span id="iv.x.cxxxiv-p6"></span>This letter is in reply to two received
from your holiness, one conveyed by Anastasius, the presbyter of Berœa,
and one by the standard-bearer Theodotus. In your last letter you
mention another, but this has not been delivered. As to my journey
thither I can say nothing till I know what orders are given concerning
me by the most pious emperor. His letter has not yet arrived.

<span id="iv.x.cxxxiv-p2"></span> John of Germanicia (vide p. 86 n.) was
on the Nestorian side at Ephesus in 431, and so naturally associated
with Theodoret. At Chalcedon he was compelled to pronounce a special
anathema against Nestorius. (Mansi vii. 193, Dict. Christ. Biog. iii.
374.) The letter is written after the deposition and before the
banishment to Nicerte. Cf. Ep. 147<span id="iv.x.cxxxiv-p2.1"></span>.
