<span id="vi.xiii.xx-p1"></span> 19. First of all, then, we must know
that the doctrine of the Cross is not regarded by all in the same light.
It is one thing to the Gentiles, to the Jews another, to Christians
another; as also the Apostle says, “We preach Christ crucified,—to the
Jews a stumbling-block, to the Gentiles foolishness, but to those who
are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ, the power of God and the
wisdom of God;” <span id="fr_3297"></span>[3298](#fn_3297) and, in the
same place, “For the preaching of the Cross is to those who perish
foolishness, but to those who are saved,” that is, to us, it is “the
Power of God.” <span id="fr_3298"></span>[3299](#fn_3298) The Jews, to
whom it had been delivered out of the Law, that Christ should abide for
ever, were offended by His Cross, because they were unwilling to believe
His resurrection. To the Gentiles it seemed foolishness that God should
have submitted to death, because they were ignorant of the mystery of
the Incarnation. But Christians, who had accepted His birth and passion
in <span id="page_551">p. 551</span> <span
id="vi.xiii.xx-Page_551"></span>the flesh and His resurrection from the
dead, of course believed that it was the power of God which had overcome
death.

<span id="vi.xiii.xx-p4"></span>First, therefore, hear how this very
thing is prophetically declared by Isaiah, that the Jews, to whom the
Prophets had foretold these things, would not believe, but that they who
had never heard them from the Prophets, would believe them. “To whom He
was not spoken of they shall see, and they that have not heard shall
understand.” <span id="fr_3299"></span>[3300](#fn_3299) Moreover, this
same Isaiah foretells that, while those who were engaged in the study of
the Law from childhood to old age believed not, to the Gentiles every
mystery should be transferred. His words are: “And the Lord of Hosts
shall make a feast on this mountain unto all nations: they shall drink
joy, they shall drink wine, they shall be anointed with ointment on this
mountain. Deliver all these things to the nations.” <span
id="fr_3300"></span>[3301](#fn_3300) This was the counsel of the
Almighty respecting all the nations. But they who boast themselves of
their knowledge of the Law will, perhaps, say to us, “You blaspheme in
saying that the Lord was subjected to the corruption of death and to the
suffering of the Cross.” Read, therefore, what you find written in the
Lamentations of Jeremiah: “The Spirit of our countenance, Christ the
Lord, was taken in our <span id="fr_3301"></span>[3302](#fn_3301)
corruptions, of whom we said, we shall live under His shadow among the
nations.” <span id="fr_3302"></span>[3303](#fn_3302) Thou hearest how
the Prophet says that Christ the Lord was taken, and for us, that is,
for our sins, delivered to corruption. Under whose shadow, since the
people of the Jews have continued in unbelief, he says the Gentiles lie,
because we live not in Israel, but among the Gentiles.
