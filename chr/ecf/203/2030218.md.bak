<span id="iv.x.xxix-p1"></span> *XXIX. To Apellion.*

<span id="iv.x.xxix-p2"></span>The sufferings of the Carthaginians would
demand, and, in their greatness, perhaps out-task, the power of the
tragic language of an Æschylus or a Sophocles. Carthage of old was with
difficulty taken by the Romans. Again and again she contended with Rome
for the mastery of the world, and brought Rome within danger of
destruction. Now the ruin has been the mere byplay of barbarians. Now
dignified members of her far-famed senate wander all over the world,
getting means of existence from the bounty of kindly strangers, moving
the tears of beholders, and teaching the uncertainty and instability of
the lot of man.

<span id="iv.x.xxix-p3"></span>I have seen many who have come thence,
and I have felt afraid, for I know not, as the Scripture says, “what the
morrow will bring forth.” <span id="fr_1663"></span>[1664](#fn_1663.md) Not
least do I admire the admirable and most honourable Celestinianus, so
bravely does he bear his misfortune, and makes the loss of his happiness
an occasion for philosophy, praising the governor of all, and holding
that to be good which God either ordains or suffers to be. For the
wisdom of divine Providence is unspeakable. He is travelling with his
wife and children, and I beg your excellency to treat him with an
hospitality like that of Abraham. With perfect confidence in your
benevolence I have undertaken to introduce him to you, and I am telling
him how generous is your right hand. <span

<span id="iv.x.xxix-p5"></span> The name Celestinianus varies in the
<span class="c14"><span id="iv.x.xxix-p5.1"></span>mss.</span> with
Celestiacus. Theodoret’s letter in his behalf may be placed shortly
after the sack of Carthage by Genseric in 439.
