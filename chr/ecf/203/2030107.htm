 But while the chiefs were in deliberation the troops met together and demanded Jovianus for emperor, though he was neither a general nor in the next highest rank; a man however remarkably distinguished, and for many reasons well known. His stature was great; his soul lofty. In war, and in grave struggles it was his wont to be first. Against impiety he delivered himself courageously with no fear of the tyrant&#146;s power, but with a zeal that ranked him among the martyrs of Christ. So the generals accepted the unanimous vote of the soldiers as a divine election. The brave man was led forward and placed upon a raised platform hastily constructed. The host saluted him with the imperial titles, calling him Augustus and C&aelig;sar. With his usual bluntness, and fearless alike in the presence of the commanding officers and in view of the recent apostasy of the troops, Jovianus admirably said &#8220;I am a Christian. I cannot govern men like these. I cannot command Julian&#146;s army trained as it is in vicious discipline. Men like these, stripped of the covering of the providence of God, will fall an easy and ridiculous prey to the foe.&#8221; On hearing this the troops shouted with one voice, &#8220;Hesitate not, O emperor; think it not a vile thing to command us. You shall reign over Christians <A NAME="page_108"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 108</FONT></A> <a name="iv.viii.iv.i-Page_108"></A>nurtured in the training of truth; our veterans were taught in the school of Constantine himself; younger men among us were taught by Constantius. This dead man&#146;s empire lasted but a few years, all too few to stamp its brand even on those whom it deceived.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_665"></A><A HREF="#fn_665"><FONT SIZE="1">666</FONT></A>

<p class="Normal"><a name="iv.viii.iv.i-p5"></A> Jovianus, son of Count Varronianus of Singidunum (Belgrade), was born in 330 or 331 and reigned from June 363 to February 364. His hasty acceptance by a part of the army may have been due to the mistake of the sound of &#8220;Jovianus Augustus&#8221; for that of &#8220;Julianus Augustus&#8221; and a belief that Julian survived. &#8220;Gentilitate enim prope perciti nominis, quod una littera discernebat, Julianum recreatum arbitrati sunt deduci magnis favoribus, ut solebat.&#8221; Amm. xxv. v. 6.</p>  
<p class="MsoEndnoteText"><a name="iv.viii.iv.i-p6"></A>&#8220;Jovian was a brilliant colonel of the guards. In all the army there was not a goodlier person than he. Julian&#146;s purple was too small for his gigantic limbs. But that stately form was animated by a spirit of cowardly selfishness. Jovian was also a decided Christian,&#8221; but &#8220;even the heathen soldiers condemned his low amours and vulgar tippling.&#8221; Gwatkin, &#8220;Arian Controversy,&#8221; 119.</p>
