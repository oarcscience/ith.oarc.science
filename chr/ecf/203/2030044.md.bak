<span id="iv.viii.i.xxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.i.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIII</span>.—*Conversion of the
Iberians* <span id="fr_416"></span>[417](#fn_416.md) .

<span id="iv.viii.i.xxiv-p3"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.i.xxiv-p3.1"></span>Frumentius</span> thus led the Indians
to the knowledge of God. Iberia, about the same time, was guided into
the way of truth by a captive woman <span
id="fr_417"></span>[418](#fn_417.md) . She continued instant in prayer,
allowing herself no softer bed than a sack spread upon the ground, and
accounted fasting her highest luxury. This austerity was rewarded by
gifts similar to those of the Apostles. The barbarians, who were
ignorant of medicine, were accustomed, when attacked by disease, to go
to one another’s houses, in order to ask those who had suffered in a
similar way, and had got well, by what means they had been cured. In
accordance with this custom, a mother who had a sick child, repaired to
this admirable woman, to enquire if she knew of any cure for the
disease. The latter took the child, placed it <span id="page_59">p.
59</span> <span id="iv.viii.i.xxiv-Page_59"></span>upon her bed, and
prayed to the Creator of the world to be propitious to it, and cure the
disease. He heard her prayer, and made it whole. This extraordinary
woman hence obtained great celebrity; and the queen, who was suffering
from a severe disease, hearing of her by report, sent for her. The
captive held herself in very low estimation, and would not accept the
invitation of the queen. But the queen, forced by her sore need, and
careless of her royal dignity, herself ran to the captive. The latter
made the queen lie down upon her mean bed, and once again applied to her
disease the efficacious remedy of prayer. The queen was healed, and
offered as rewards for her cure, gold, silver, tunics, and mantles, and
such gifts as she thought worthy of possession, and such as royal
munificence should bestow. The holy woman told her that she did not want
any of these, but that she would deem her greatest reward to be the
queen’s knowledge of true religion. She then, as far as in her lay,
explained the Divine doctrines, and exhorted her to erect a church in
honour of Christ who had made her whole. The queen then returned to the
palace, and excited the admiration of her consort, by the suddenness of
her cure; she then made known to him the power of that God whom the
captive adored, and besought him to acknowledge the one only God, and to
erect a church to Him, and to lead all the nation to worship Him. The
king was greatly delighted with the miracle which had been performed
upon the queen, but he would not consent to erect a church. A short time
after he went out hunting, and the loving Lord made a prey of him as He
did of Paul; for a sudden darkness enveloped him and forbade him to move
from the spot; while those who were hunting with him enjoyed the
customary sunlight, and he alone was bound with the fetters of
blindness. In his perplexity he found a way of escape, for calling to
mind his former unbelief, he implored the help of the God of the captive
woman, and immediately the darkness was dispelled. He then went to the
marvellous captive, and asked her to shew him how a church ought to be
built. He who once filled Bezaleel with architectural skill, graciously
enabled this woman to devise the plan of a church. The woman set about
the plan, and men began to dig and build. When the edifice was
completed, the roof put on, and every thing supplied except the priests,
this admirable woman found means to obtain these also. For she persuaded
the king to send an embassy to the Roman emperor asking for teachers of
religion. The king accordingly despatched an embassy for the purpose.
The emperor Constantine, who was warmly attached to the cause of
religion, when informed of the purport of the embassy, gladly welcomed
the ambassadors, and selected a bishop endowed with great faith, wisdom,
and virtue, and presenting him with many gifts, sent him to the
Iberians, that he might make known to them the true God. Not content
with having granted the requests of the Iberians, he of his own accord
undertook the protection of the Christians in Persia; for, learning that
they were persecuted by the heathens, and that their king himself, a
slave to error, was contriving various cunning plots for their
destruction, he wrote to him, entreating him to embrace the Christian
religion himself, as well as to honour its professors. His own letter
will render his earnestness in the cause the plainer.

<span id="iv.viii.i.xxiv-p2"></span> This story, like the preceding, is
copied or varied by Sozomen, Socrates, and our author, from the version
found also in Rufinus. Iberia, the modern Georgia, was conquered by
Pompey, and ceded by Jovian.

<span id="iv.viii.i.xxiv-p4"></span> The Evangelizer of Georgia is
honoured on Dec. 15th (Guerin Pet. Bolland, xiv. 306) as “Sainte
Chrétienne,” and it is doubtful whether the name Nina, in which she
appears in the Armenogregorian Calendar for June 11 (Neale, Eastern
Church, ii. 799), may not be a title. “Nina” is probably a name of rank,
and perhaps is connected with our nun (Neale, i. 61). Moses of Chorene
(ii. 83) gives the name “Nunia.” Rufinus (i. 10) states that he gives
the story as he heard it from King Bacurius at Jerusalem. On the various
legends of St. Nina and her work, vide S. C. Malan, Hist. of Georgian
Church pp. 17–33.
