<span id="iv.x.xxxii-p1"></span> *XXXII. To the Bishop
Theoctistus.* <span id="fr_1669"></span>[1670](#fn_1669.md)

<span id="iv.x.xxxii-p3"></span>If the God of all had forthwith
inflicted punishment on all that err he would utterly have destroyed all
men. But He spares; He is a merciful Judge; and therefore some He
chastises, and to others He gives the lesson of the punishment of the
chastised. An instance of this merciful dealing has been shewn in our
times. Exiles from what was once known as Libya, but is now called
Africa, have been brought by Him to our doors, and by shewing us their
sufferings He moves us to fear, and by fear rouses us to sympathy; thus
He accomplishes two ends at once, for He both benefits us by their
chastisement, and to them by our means brings comfort. This comfort I
now beg you to give to the very admirable and honourable Celestinianus,
a man who once was an ornament of the Africans’ chief city, but now has
neither city nor home, nor any of the necessaries of life. Now it is
proper that those who in the jurisdiction of your holiness have been
entrusted with the pastoral care of souls should bring before their
fellow citizens what is for their good, for indeed they need such
teaching. For this reason, as we know, the divine Apostle in his Epistle
to Titus writes “Let ours also learn to maintain good works for
necessary uses,” <span id="fr_1670"></span>[1671](#fn_1670.md) for if our
city, solitary as it is, and with only a small population, and that a
poor one, succours the strangers, much rather may Berœa, <span
id="fr_1671"></span>[1672](#fn_1671.md) which has been nurtured in true
religion, be expected to do so, especially under the leadership of your
holiness.
