id="iv.viii.v.xxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIX</span>.—*Of the idol
temples which were destroyed by John in Phœnicia*.

<span id="iv.viii.v.xxix-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.v.xxix-p2.1"></span>On</span> receiving information that
Phœnicia was still suffering from the madness of the demons’ rites, John
got together certain monks who were fired with divine zeal, armed them
with imperial edicts and despatched them against the idols’ shrines. The
money which was required to pay the craftsmen and their assistants who
were engaged in the work of destruction was not taken by John from
imperial resources, but he persuaded certain wealthy and faithful women
to make liberal contributions, pointing out to them how great would be
the blessing their generosity would win.

<span id="iv.viii.v.xxix-p3"></span>Thus the remaining shrines of the
demons were utterly destroyed. <span id="fr_916"></span>[917](#fn_916.md)
