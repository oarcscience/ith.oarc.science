id="v.iv.xxii-p2.1"></span>Severianus</span>, <span
id="fr_2608"></span>[2609](#fn_2608) bishop of the church of Gabala, was
learned in the Holy Scriptures and a wonderful preacher of homilies. On
this account he was frequently summoned by the bishop John and the
emperor Arcadius to preach a sermon at Constantinople. I have read his
*Exposition of the epistle to the Galatians* and a most attractive
little work *On baptism and the feast of Epiphany.* He died in the reign
of Theodosius, his son by baptism.
