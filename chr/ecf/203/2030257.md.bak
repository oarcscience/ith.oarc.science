<span id="iv.x.lxviii-p1"></span> *LXVIII. To Epiphanius.*

<span id="iv.x.lxviii-p2"></span>It was my wish to summon you to the
feast of holy Apostles and Prophets, not only as a citizen, but as one
who shares both my faith and my home. But I am prevented by the state of
your opinions. Therefore I put forward no other claims than those of our
country, and I invite you to participate in the precious blessing of the
holy Apostles and Prophets. This participation no difference of
sentiment hinders.
