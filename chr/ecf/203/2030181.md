id="iv.ix.i-p2.1"></span>The “Eranistes” <span
id="fr_964"></span>[965](#fn_964) or “Polymorphus” <span
id="fr_965"></span>[966](#fn_965) of the Blessed Theodoretus, Bishop of
Cyrus.</span>

<span id="iv.ix.i-p5"></span>————————————

<span id="iv.ix.i-p6"></span><span class="c21"><span
id="iv.ix.i-p6.1"></span>Prologue.</span>

<span id="iv.ix.i-p7"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.ix.i-p7.1"></span>Some</span> men, distinguished neither by
family nor education, and without any of the honourable notoriety that
comes of an upright life, are ambitious of achieving fame by wicked
ways. Of these was the famous Alexander, the coppersmith, <span
id="fr_966"></span>[967](#fn_966) a man of no sort of distinction at
all,—no nobility of birth, no eloquence of speech, who never led a
political party nor an army in the field; who never played the man in
fight, but plied from day to day his ignominious craft, and won fame for
nothing but his mad violence against Saint Paul.

<span id="iv.ix.i-p9"></span>Shimei, <span
id="fr_967"></span>[968](#fn_967) again, an obscure person of servile
rank, has become very renowned for his audacious attack on the holy
David.

<span id="iv.ix.i-p11"></span>It is said too that the originator of the
Manichæan heresy was a mere whipping-block of a slave, and, from love of
notoriety, composed his execrable and superstitious writings.

<span id="iv.ix.i-p12"></span>The same line of conduct is pursued by
many now, who after turning their backs on the honourable glory of
virtue on account of the toil to be undergone ere it be won, purchase to
themselves the notoriety that comes of shame and disgrace. For through
eagerness to pose as champions of new doctrines they pick up and get
together the impiety of many heresies, and compile this heresy of death.

<span id="iv.ix.i-p13"></span>Now I will endeavour briefly to dispute
with them, with the double object of curing them, if I can, of their
unsoundness, and of giving a word of warning to the whole.

<span id="iv.ix.i-p14"></span>I call my work “Eranistes, or
Polymorphus,” for, after getting together from many unhappy sources
their baleful doctrines, they produce their patchwork and incongruous
conceit. For to call our Lord Christ God only is the way of Simon, of
Cerdo, of Marcion, <span id="fr_968"></span>[969](#fn_968) and of others
who share this abominable opinion.

<span id="iv.ix.i-p16"></span>The acknowledgment of His birth from a
Virgin, but coupled with the assertion that this birth was merely a
process of transition, and that God the Word took nothing of the
Virgin’s nature, is stolen from Valentinus and Bardesanes and the
adherents of their fables. <span id="fr_969"></span>[970](#fn_969)

<span id="iv.ix.i-p18"></span>To call the godhead and the manhood of the
Lord Christ one nature is the error filched from the follies of
Apollinarius. <span id="fr_970"></span>[971](#fn_970)

<span id="iv.ix.i-p20"></span>Again the attribution of capacity of
suffering to the divinity of the Christ is a theft from the blasphemy of
Arius and Eunomius. Thus the main principle of their teaching is like
beggars’ gabardines—a cento of ill-matched rags.

<span id="iv.ix.i-p21"></span>So I call this work Eranistes or
Polymorphus. I shall write it in the form of a dialogue with questions
and answers, pro<span id="page_161">p. 161</span> <span
id="iv.ix.i-Page_161"></span>positions, solutions, and antitheses, and
all else that a dialogue ought to have. I shall not insert the names of
the questioners and respondents in the body of the dialogue as did the
wise Greeks of old, but I shall write them at the side at the beginning
of the paragraphs. They, indeed, put their writings in the hands of
readers highly and variously educated, and to whom literature was life.
I, on the contrary, wish the reading of what I write, and the discovery
of whatever good it may give, to be an easy task, even to the
illiterate. This I think will be facilitated if the characters of the
interlocutors are plainly shown by their names in the margin, so the
disputant who argues on behalf of the apostolical decrees is called
“Orthodoxos,” and his opponent “Eranistes.” A man who is fed by the
charity of many we commonly call “Beggar;” a man who knows how to get
money together we call a “Chrematistes.” So we have given our disputant
this name from his character and pursuits.

<span id="iv.ix.i-p22"></span>I beg that all those into whose hands my
book may fall will lay aside all preconceived opinion and put the truth
to the test. For clearness’ sake I will divide my book into three
dialogues. The first will contain the contention that the Godhead of the
only-begotten Son is immutable. The second will by God’s help show that
the union of the Godhead and the manhood of the Lord Christ is without
confusion. The third will contend for the impassibility of the divinity
of our saviour. After these three disputations we will subjoin several
others as it were to complete them, giving formal proof under each head,
and making it perfectly plain that the apostles’ doctrine is preserved
by us.

id="iv.ix.i-p3.1"></span>ἔ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.ix.i-p3.2"></span>ρανος</span>—a meal to which every one
contributes a share; a club feast, or pic-nic, and <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.ix.i-p3.3"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.ix.i-p3.4"></span>ρανιστὴς</span> is in
classical Greek a contributor to such a feast. But <span

class="Greek"><span id="iv.ix.i-p3.6"></span>ρανίζω</span> <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.ix.i-p3.7"></span>= (α</span>) “contribute,”
and (<span class="Greek"><span id="iv.ix.i-p3.8"></span>β</span>) “beg
for contributions.” So <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.ix.i-p3.9"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.ix.i-p3.10"></span>ρανιστὴς</span> is by some rendered “beggar.”
The idea of Theodoretus seems rather that his worse character is a
picker up of various scraps of heresy from different quarters, and this
explanation of the name is borne out by his use of the cognate verb
<span class="Greek"><span id="iv.ix.i-p3.11"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.ix.i-p3.12"></span>ρανιζομαι</span> in
reference to the selection by Audæus of some of the doctrines of Manes
in Hist. iv. 9.

<span id="iv.ix.i-p15"></span> Cerdo, the gnostic teacher of the middle
of the 2nd c., and placed by Theodoretus (Hær. Fab. i. 24) in the reign
of Antoninus, <span class="c14"><span
id="iv.ix.i-p15.1"></span>a.d.</span> 138–161, is described by the Ps.
Tertullian as denying that Christ came in the substance of the flesh,
but in appearance only. According to Marcion the greater follower of
Cerdo, Christ was not born at all, but came down from heaven to
Capernaum <span class="c14"><span id="iv.ix.i-p15.2"></span>a.d.</span>
29, his body being an appearance and his death an illusion. Simon Magus,
the “father of all heretics” of Irenæus (adv. Hær. pr. in lib. iii.) is
apparently quoted rather as the supposed originator of Gnosticism, than
from any definite knowledge of his tenets.

arch-gnostic is identified with the doctrine of emanation. Bardesanes
(Bar Daisan), who lived some thirty years later at Edessa, was a great
leader of the Syrian school of oriental dualism. For mention of his son
Harmonius vide Hist. p. 129.
