 bishop of Cappadocia, desiring to visit the Holy Land, came to Jerusalem, at the time when Narcissus, bishop of this city, already an old man, ruled the church. It was revealed to Narcissus and many of his clergy, that on the morning of the next day, a bishop would enter the city, who should be assistant on the sacerdotal throne. And so it came to pass, as it was predicted, and all the bishops of Palestine being gathered together, Narcissus himself being especially urgent, Alexander took with him the helm of the church of Jerusalem. At the end of one of his epistles, written to the Antinoites <i>On the peace of the church,</i> he says &#8220;Narcissus, who held the bishopric here before me, and now with me exercises his office by his prayers, being about a hundred and sixteen years old, salutes you, and with me begs you to become of one mind.&#8221; He wrote another also <i>To the Antiocheans,</i> by the hand of Clement, the presbyter of Alexandria, of whom we spoke above, another also <i>To Origen,</i> and <i>In behalf of Origen against Demetrius,</i> called forth by the fact that, according to the testimony of Demetrius, he had made Origen presbyter. There are other epistles of his to different persons. In the seventh persecution under Decius, at the time when Babylas of Antioch was put to death, brought to C&aelig;sarea and shut up in prison, he received the crown of martyrdom for confessing Christ.</p>
