<span id="iv.viii.v.xxxv-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.v.xxxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXV</span>.—*Of Alexander,
bishop of Antioch*.

<span id="iv.viii.v.xxxv-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.v.xxxv-p2.1"></span>At</span> this time the see of
Alexandria was held by Cyril, <span id="fr_930"></span>[931](#fn_930)
brother’s son to Theophilus whom he succeeded; at the same time
Jeru<span id="page_155">p. 155</span> <span
id="iv.viii.v.xxxv-Page_155"></span>salem was occupied by John <span
id="fr_931"></span>[932](#fn_931) in succession to Cyril whom we have
formerly mentioned. The Antiochenes were under the care of
Alexander <span id="fr_932"></span>[933](#fn_932) whose life and
conversation were of a piece with his episcopate. Before his
consecration he passed his time in ascetic training and in hard bodily
exercise. He was known as a noble champion, teaching by word and
confirming the word by deed. His predecessor was Porphyrius who guided
that church after Flavianus, and left behind him many memorials of his
loving character. <span id="fr_933"></span>[934](#fn_933) He was also
distinguished by intellectual power. The holy Alexander was specially
rich in self discipline and philosophy; his life was one of poverty and
self denial; his eloquence was copious and his other gifts were
innumerable; by his advice and exhortation, the following of the great
Eustathius which Paulinus, and after him Evagrius, had not permitted to
be restored, was united to the rest of the body, and a festival was
celebrated the like of which none had ever seen before. The bishop
gathered all the faithful together, both clergy and laity, and marched
with them to the assembly. The procession was accompanied by musicians;
one hymn was sung by all in harmony, and thus he and his company went in
procession from the western postern to the great church, filling the
whole forum with people, and constituting a stream of thinking living
beings like the Orontes in its course.

<span id="iv.viii.v.xxxv-p7"></span>When this was seen by the Jews, by
the victims of the Arian plague, and by the insignificant remnant of
Pagans, they set up a groaning and wailing, and were distressed at
seeing the rest of the rivers discharging their waters into the Church.
By Alexander the name of the great John was first inscribed in the
records <span id="fr_934"></span>[935](#fn_934) of the Church.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_930"></span>[154:931](2030175.htm#fr_930) <span
id="iv.viii.v.xxxv-p2.2"></span>

<span id="iv.viii.v.xxxv-p3"></span> Cyril occupied the Episcopal throne
of Alexandria from 412 to 444. Theodoretus could not be expected to
allude to the withdrawal of the Roman legions from Britain in 401, or
the release of Britoins from their allegiance by Honorius in 410. The
sack of Rome by the Goths in the latter year might have however claimed
a passing notice.

<span id="fn_931"></span>[155:932](2030175.htm#fr_931) <span
id="iv.viii.v.xxxv-p3.1"></span>

<span id="iv.viii.v.xxxv-p4"></span> Of the five Johns more or less well
known as bishop of Jerusalem this was the second—from 386 to 417. He is
chiefly known to us from the severe criticisms of Jerome.

<span id="fn_932"></span>[155:933](2030175.htm#fr_932) <span
id="iv.viii.v.xxxv-p4.1"></span>

<span id="iv.viii.v.xxxv-p5"></span> Bp. from 413 to 421.

<span id="fn_933"></span>[155:934](2030175.htm#fr_933) <span
id="iv.viii.v.xxxv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iv.viii.v.xxxv-p6"></span> Palladius (Dial. 143 et Seqq.)
describes Porphyrius as a monster of frivolity, iniquity, and
bitterness. It is interesting to hear both sides.

<span id="fn_934"></span>[155:935](2030175.htm#fr_934) <span
id="iv.viii.v.xxxv-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iv.viii.v.xxxv-p8"></span> Theodoret here uses the word <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.viii.v.xxxv-p8.1"></span>δίπτυχον</span>.
Other words in use were <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.viii.v.xxxv-p8.2"></span>ἱ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.viii.v.xxxv-p8.3"></span>εραὶ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.viii.v.xxxv-p8.4"></span>,</span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.viii.v.xxxv-p8.5"></span>δέλτοι</span> and <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.viii.v.xxxv-p8.6"></span>κατάλογοι</span>.
The names engraved on these tablets were recited during the celebration
of the Holy Eucharist. e.g. at Carthage in 411 we find it said of
Cæcilianus: *“In ecclesia sumus in qua episcopatum gessit et diem obiit.
Ejus nomen ad altare recitamus ejus memoriæ communicamus tanquam memoriæ
fratris.”* (Dict. Christ. Ant. i. 561. Labbe ii. 1490.) Names were
sometimes erased from unworthy motives. A survival of the use obtains in
the English Church in the Prayer for the Church Militant, and more
specifically in the recitation of names in the Bidding Prayer.
