id="fr_2424"></span>[2425](#fn_2424) sixth bishop of the church of
Antioch, in the reign of the emperor Marcus Antoninus Verus composed a
book *Against Marcion,* which is still extant, also three volumes *To
Autolycus* and one *Against the heresy of Hermogenes* and other short
and elegant treatises, well fitted for the edification of the church. I
have read, under his name, commentaries *On the Gospel* and *On the
proverbs of Solomon* which do not appear to me to correspond in style
and language with the elegance and expressiveness of the above works.
