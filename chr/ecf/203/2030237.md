<span id="iv.x.xlviii-p1"></span> *XLVIII. To Eustathius, Bishop of
Berytus.* <span id="fr_1693"></span>[1694](#fn_1693.md)

<span id="iv.x.xlviii-p3"></span>I have gladly received the accusation,
although I have no difficulty in disproving the indictment. I have
written not three letters only but four; and I suspect one of two
things; either those who promised to convey the letters did me wrong in
the matter of their delivery, or else your piety, though in receipt of
them, is yet anxious for more, and so gets up a charge of idleness
against me. I, as I said before, am not distressed at the accusation,
for it is plain proof to me of the warmth of your affection. Continue
then to ply your craft, cease not to prefer your complaint and so to
cause pleasure to myself.

<span id="iv.x.xlviii-p2"></span> Eustathius of Berytus (Beyrout) was a
bad specimen of the time-serving ecclesiastic. Fierce in his attacks on
Ibas, and a prominent member of the Latrocinium in 449, he narrowly
escaped deposition himself at Chalcedon in 451.
