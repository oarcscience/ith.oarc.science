<span id="iv.x.xvi"></span>

<span id="iv.x.xvi-p1"></span> *XVI. To Bishop Irenæus.* <span
id="fr_1639"></span>[1640](#fn_1639.md)

<span id="iv.x.xvi-p3"></span>There is nothing good, it seems, in
prospect for us, so, far from calming down, the tempest troubling the
Church seems to rise higher every day. The conveners of the Council have
arrived and delivered the letters of summons to several of the
Metropolitans including our own, and I have sent a copy of the letter to
your Holiness to acquaint you how, as the poet has it, “Woe has been
welded by woe.” <span id="fr_1640"></span>[1641](#fn_1640.md) And we need
only the Lord’s goodness to stay the storm. Easy it is for Him to stay
it, but we are unworthy of the calm, yet the grace of His patience is
enough for us, so that haply by it we may get the better of our foes. So
the divine apostle has taught us to pray “for He will with the
temptation also make a way to escape that ye may be able to bear
it.” <span id="fr_1641"></span>[1642](#fn_1641.md) But I beseech your
godliness to stop the mouths of the objectors and make them understand
that it is not for them who stand, as the phrase goes, out of range, to
scoff at men fighting in the ranks and giving and receiving blows; for
what matters it what weapon the soldier uses to strike down his
antagonists? Even the great David did not use a panoply when he slew the
aliens’ champion, <span id="fr_1642"></span>[1643](#fn_1642.md) and Samson
slew thousands on one day with the jawbone of an ass. <span
id="fr_1643"></span>[1644](#fn_1643.md) Nobody grumbles at the victory, nor
accuses the conqueror of cowardice, because he wins it without
brandishing a spear or covering himself with his shield or throwing
darts or shooting arrows. The defenders of true religion must be
criticized in the same way, nor must we try to find language which will
stir strife, but rather arguments which plainly proclaim the truth and
make those who venture to oppose it ashamed of themselves.

<span id="iv.x.xvi-p8"></span>What does it matter whether we style the
holy Virgin at the same time mother of Man and mother of God, or call
her mother and servant of her offspring, with the addition that she is
mother of our Lord Jesus Christ as man, but His servant as God, and so
at once avoid the term which is the pretext of <span id="page_256">p.
256</span> <span id="iv.x.xvi-Page_256"></span>calumny, and express the
same opinion by another phrase? And besides this it must also be borne
in mind that the former of these titles is of general use, and the
latter peculiar to the Virgin; and that it is about this that all the
controversy has arisen, which would God had never been. The majority of
the old Fathers have applied the more honourable title to the Virgin, as
your Holiness yourself has done in two or three discourses; several of
these, which your godliness sent to me, I have in my own possession, and
in these you have not coupled the title mother of Man with mother of
God, but have explained its meaning by the use of other words. But since
you find fault with me for having left out the holy and blessed Fathers
Diodorus and Theodorus in my list of authorities, I have thought it
necessary to add a few words on this point.

<span id="iv.x.xvi-p9"></span>In the first place, my dear friend, I have
omitted many others both famous and illustrious. Secondly this fact must
be borne in mind, that the accused party is bound to produce
unimpeachable witnesses, whose testimony even his accusers cannot
impugn. But if the defendant were to call into court authorities accused
by the prosecutors, even the judge himself would not consent to receive
them. If I had omitted these holy men in compiling an eulogy of the
Fathers, I should, I own, have been wrong, and should have proved myself
ungrateful to my teachers. But if when under accusation I have brought
forward a defence, and have produced unimpeachable witnesses, why do men
who are unwilling to see any of these testimonies lay me under
unreasonable blame? How I reverence these writers is sufficiently shewn
by my own book in their behalf, in which I have refuted the indictment
laid against them, without fear of the influence of their accusers or
even of the secret attack made upon myself. These people who are so fond
of foolish talk had better get some other excuse for their sleight of
words. My object is not to make my words and deeds fit the pleasure of
this man or that man, but to edify the church of God, and please her
bridegroom and Lord. I call my conscience to witness that I am not
acting as I do through care of material things, nor because I cling to
the honour with all its cares, which I shrink from calling an unhappy
one. I would long ago have withdrawn of my own accord, did I not fear
the judgment of God. And now know well that I await my fate. And I think
that it is drawing near, for so the plots against me indicate. <span
