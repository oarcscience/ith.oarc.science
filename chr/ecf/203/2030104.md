<span id="iv.viii.iii.xxi-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.iii.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXI</span>.—*Of the sorcery at
Carræ which was detected after his death. After he was slain the
jugglery of his sorcery was detected. For Carræ is a city which still
retains the relics of his false religion*.

<span id="iv.viii.iii.xxi-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.iii.xxi-p2.1"></span>Julian</span> had left Edessa on his
left because it was adorned with the grace of true religion, and while
in his vain folly he was journeying through Carræ, he came to the temple
honoured by the impious and after going through certain rites with his
companions in defilement, he locked and sealed the doors, and stationed
sentinels with orders to see that none came in till his return. When
news came of his death, and the reign of iniquity was succeeded by one
of piety, the shrine was opened, and within was found a proof of the
late emperor’s manliness, wisdom, and piety. <span
id="fr_661"></span>[662](#fn_661) For there was seen a woman hung up on
high by the hairs of her head, and with her hands outstretched. The
villain had cut open her belly, and so I suppose learnt from her liver
his victory over the Persians. <span id="fr_662"></span>[663](#fn_662)

<span id="iv.viii.iii.xxi-p5"></span>This was the abomination discovered
at Carræ.
