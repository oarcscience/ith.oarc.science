<span id="vi.xii.ii.xxv-p1"></span> <span id="page_515">p. 515</span>
<span id="vi.xii.ii.xxv-Page_515"></span>24. My brother Eusebius writes
to me that, when he was at a meeting of African bishops which had been
called for certain ecclesiastical affairs, he found there a letter
purporting to be written by me, in which I professed penitence and
confessed that it was through the influence of the press in my youth
that I had been led to turn the Scriptures into Latin from the Hebrew;
in all of which there is not a word of truth. When I heard this, I was
stupefied. But one witness was not enough; even Cato was not believed on
his unsupported evidence: <span id="fr_3130"></span>[3131](#fn_3130.md) “In
the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established.”
Letters were soon brought me from many brethren in Rome asking about
this very matter, whether the facts were as was stated: and they pointed
in a way to make me weep to the person by whom the letter had been
circulated among the people. He who dared to do this, what will he not
dare to do? It is well that ill will has not a strength equal to its
intentions. Innocence would be dead long ago if wickedness were always
allied to power, and calumny could prevail in all that it seeks to
accomplish. It was impossible for him, accomplished as he was, to copy
any style and manner of writing, whatever their value may be; amidst all
his tricks and his fraudulent assumption of another man’s personality,
it was evident who he was. It is this same man, then, who wrote this
fictitious letter of retractation in my name, making out that my
translation of the Hebrew books was bad, who, we now hear, accuses me of
having translated the Holy Scriptures with a view to disparage the
Septuagint. In any case, whether my translation is right or wrong, I am
to be condemned: I must either confess that in my new work I was wrong,
or else that by my new version I have aimed a blow at the old. I wonder
that in this letter he did not make me out as guilty of homicide, or
adultery or sacrilege or parricide or any of the vile things which the
silent working of the mind can revolve within itself. Indeed I ought to
be grateful to him for having imputed to me no more than one act of
error or false dealing out of the whole forest of possible crimes. Am I
likely to have said anything derogatory to the seventy translators,
whose work I carefully purged from corruptions and gave to Latin readers
many years ago, and daily expound it at our conventual gatherings; <span
id="fr_3131"></span>[3132](#fn_3131.md) whose version of the Psalms has so
long been the subject of my meditation and my song? Was I so foolish as
to wish to forget in old age what I learned in youth? All my treatises
have been woven out of statements warranted by their version. My
commentaries on the twelve prophets are an explanation of their version
as well as my own. How uncertain must the labours of men ever be! and
how contrary at times to their own intentions are the results which
men’s studies reach. I thought that I deserved well of my countrymen the
Latins by this version, and had given them an incitement to learning;
for it is not despised even by the Greeks now that it is retranslated
into their language; yet it is now made the subject of a charge against
me; and I find that the food pressed upon them turns upon the stomach.
What is there in human life that can be safe if innocence is made the
object of accusation? I am the householder <span
id="fr_3132"></span>[3133](#fn_3132.md) who finds that while he slept the
enemy has sown tares among his wheat. <span
id="fr_3133"></span>[3134](#fn_3133.md) “The wild boar out of the wood has
rooted up my vineyard, and the strange wild beast has devoured it.” I
keep silence, but a letter that is not mine speaks against me. I am
ignorant of the crime laid against me, yet I am made to confess the
crime all through the world. <span id="fr_3134"></span>[3135](#fn_3134.md)
“Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast borne me a man to be judged and
condemned <span id="fr_3135"></span>[3136](#fn_3135.md) in the whole
earth.”
