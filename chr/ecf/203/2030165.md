<span id="iv.viii.v.xxv-p2"></span> Theodosius died of dropsy at Milan,
Jan. 17, 395. “The character of Theodosius is one of the most perplexing
in history. The church historians have hardly a word of blame for him
except in the matter of the massacre of Thessalonica, and that seems to
be almost atoned for in their eyes by its perpetrator’s penitent
submission to ecclesiastical censure. On the other hand the heathen
historians, represented by Zosimus, condemn in the most unmeasured terms
his insolence, his love of pleasure, his pride, and hint at the
scandalous immorality of his life.” “It is the fashion to call him the
Great, and we may admit that he has as good a right to that title as
Lewis XIV., a monarch whom in some respects he pretty closely resembles.
But it seems to me that it would be safer to withhold this title from
both sovereigns, and to call them not the Great, but the Magnificent.”
Hodgkin, *Dynasty of Theodosius.* 133.

<span id="iv.viii.v.xxv-p3"></span>The great champion of orthodoxy, he
was no violent persecutor, and received at his death from a grateful
paganism the official honours of apotheosis.
