<span id="vi.xv-p5"></span>Rufinus to Apronianus, his own friend.

<span id="vi.xv-p6"></span>I know that, just as the sheep come gladly
when their own shepherd calls them, so in matters of religion men attend
most gladly to the admonitions of a teacher who speaks their own
language: and therefore, my very dear Apronianus, when that pious lady
who is my daughter but now your sister in Christ, had laid her commands
on me to compose for her a treatise of such a nature that its
understanding should not require any great effort, I translated into
Latin in a very open and plain style the work of Xystus, who is said to
be the same man who at Rome is called Sixtus, and who gained the glory
of being both bishop and martyr. I think that, when she reads this, she
will find it expressed with such brevity that a vast meaning is unfolded
in each several line, with such power that a sentence only a line long
would suffice for a whole life’s training, and yet with such simplicity
that one who looked over the shoulder of a girl as she read it might
question whether I were not quite weak in intellect. And the whole work
is so concise that it would be possible for her never to let go of it.
The entire book would hardly be bigger than the finger ring of one of
our ancestors. And indeed it seems but right that one who has learnt
through the word of God to count as dross the ornaments of the world
should now receive at my hands by way of ornament a necklace of the word
and of wisdom. For the present let this little book serve for a ring and
be kept constantly in the hands: but it will not be long before it will
penetrate into the treasure house and be wholly laid up in the heart,
and bring forth from its innermost chamber the germs of instruction and
of a participation in all good works. I have added further a few choice
sayings addressed by a pious father to his son, but all so succinct that
the whole of this little work may rightly be called in Greek the
Enchiridion <span id="fr_3436"></span>[3437](#fn_3436.md) or in Latin the
Annulus. <span id="fr_3437"></span>[3438](#fn_3437.md)
