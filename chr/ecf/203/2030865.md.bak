<span id="vi.xiii.xvii-p1"></span> 16. But perhaps some one is alarmed
at hearing us discourse of the death of Him of Whom, a short while
since, we said that <span id="page_550">p. 550</span> <span
id="vi.xiii.xvii-Page_550"></span>He is everlasting with God the Father,
and that He was begotten of the Father’s substance, and is one with God
the Father, in dominion, majesty, and eternity. But be not alarmed, O
faithful hearer. Presently thou wilt see Him of Whose death thou hearest
once more immortal; for the death to which He submits is about to spoil
death. For the object of that mystery of the Incarnation which we
expounded just now was that the divine virtue of the Son of God, as
though it were a hook concealed beneath the form and fashion of human
flesh (He being, as the Apostle Paul says, “found in fashion as a
man”), <span id="fr_3293"></span>[3294](#fn_3293.md) might lure on the
Prince of this world to a conflict, to whom offering His flesh as a
bait, His divinity underneath might catch him and hold him fast with its
hook, through the shedding of His immaculate blood. For He alone Who
knows no stain of sin hath destroyed the sins of all, of those, at
least, who have marked the door-posts of their faith with His blood. As,
therefore, if a fish seizes a baited hook, it not only does not take the
bait off the hook, but is drawn out of the water to be itself food for
others, so He Who had the power of death seized the body of Jesus in
death, not being aware of the hook of Divinity inclosed within it, but
having swallowed it he was caught forthwith, and the bars of hell being
burst asunder, he was drawn forth as it were from the abyss to become
food for others. Which result the Prophet Ezekiel long ago foretold
under this same figure, saying, “I will draw thee out with My hook, and
stretch thee out upon the earth: the plains shall be filled with thee,
and I will set all the fowls of the air over thee, and I will satiate
all the beasts of the earth with thee.” <span
id="fr_3294"></span>[3295](#fn_3294.md) The Prophet David also says, “Thou
hast broken the heads of the great dragon, Thou hast given him to be
meat to the people of Ethiopia.” <span
id="fr_3295"></span>[3296](#fn_3295.md) And Job in like manner witnesses of
the same mystery, for he says in the person of the Lord speaking to him,
“Wilt thou draw forth the dragon with a hook, and wilt thou put thy bit
in his nostrils?” <span id="fr_3296"></span>[3297](#fn_3296.md)
