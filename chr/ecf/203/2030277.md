<span id="iv.x.lxxxviii-p1"></span> *LXXXVIII. To Taurus the
Patrician.* <span id="fr_1796"></span>[1797](#fn_1796)

<span id="iv.x.lxxxviii-p3"></span>Slanderers have forced me to go
beyond the bounds of moderation, and compel me to write to you who have
adorned the highest offices, and obtained the most distinguished
honours. I therefore implore you to pardon me, for I do not write in
self sufficiency, but because I am thrust forward by necessity. It is
not because I expect to fall unjustly into trouble and distress, for
this is the common fate of all who have sincerely served God, but
because I desire to persuade your excellency that those who accuse my
opinions are producing false charges against me. From my mother’s breast
I have been nurtured on apostolic teaching, and the creed laid down at
Nicæa by the holy and blessed Fathers I have both learnt and teach. All
who hold any other opinion I charge with impiety, and if any one
persists in asserting that I teach the contrary, let him not bring a
charge which I cannot defend, but convict me to my face. For this is
agreeable to the laws alike of God and of man, but to whom is it so
becoming to champion the wronged as to you, O friend of Christ, to whom
boldness of utterance is given by the splendour of your lineage, the
greatness of your rank and your foremost place in the law?
