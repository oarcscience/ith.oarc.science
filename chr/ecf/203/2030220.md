<span id="iv.x.xxxi-p1"></span> *XXXI. To Domnus Bishop of
Antioch.* <span id="fr_1668"></span>[1669](#fn_1668.md)

<span id="iv.x.xxxi-p3"></span>The most admirable and honourable
Celestinianus is a native of the famous Carthage, and of an illustrious
family in that city. <span id="page_261">p. 261</span> <span
id="iv.x.xxxi-Page_261"></span>Now he has been exiled from it. He is
wandering in foreign parts, and has to look to the benevolence of them
that love God. He carries with him a burden from which he cannot escape
and which increases his care—I mean his wife, his children and his
servants, for whom he is at great expense. I wonder at his spirit. For
he praises the great Pilot as though he were being borne by favourable
breezes, and cares nothing for the terrible storm. From his calamity he
has reaped the fruit of piety, and this thrice blessed gain has been
brought him by his misfortune; for while he was in prosperity he never
accepted this teaching, but when the evil day left him bare, among the
rest of his losses he lost his impiety too, and now possesses the wealth
of the faith, and for its sake thinks little of his ruin.

<span id="iv.x.xxxi-p4"></span>I therefore beseech your holiness to let
him find a fatherland in these foreign parts, and to charge them that
abound in riches to comfort one who once was endowed like themselves,
and to scatter the dark cloud of his calamity. It is only right and
proper that among men of like nature, where all have erred, they that
have escaped chastisement should bring comfort to them that have fallen
on evil days, and by their sympathy for these latter propitiate the
mercy of God.
