<span id="vi.xi.iii.xxxviii-p1"></span> 33. There has been from the
first in the churches of God, and especially in that of Jerusalem, a
plentiful supply of men who being born Jews have become Christians; and
their perfect acquaintance with both languages and their sufficient
knowledge of the law is shewn by their administration of the pontifical
office. In all this abundance of learned men, has there been one who has
dared to make havoc of the divine record handed down to the Churches by
the Apostles and the deposit of the Holy Spirit? For what can we call it
but havoc, when some parts of it are transformed, and this is called the
correction of an error? For instance, the whole of the history of
Susanna, which gave a lesson of chastity to the churches of God, has by
him been cut out, thrown aside and dismissed. The hymn of the three
children, which is regularly sung on festivals in the Church of God, he
has wholly erased from the place where it stood. But why should I
enumerate these cases one by one, when their number cannot be estimated?
This, however, cannot be passed over. The seventy translators, each in
their separate cells, produced a version couched in consonant and
identical words, under the inspiration, as we cannot doubt, of the Holy
Spirit; and this version must certainly be of more authority with us
than a translation made by a single man under the inspiration of
Barabbas. But, putting this aside, I beg you to listen, for example, to
this as an instance of what we mean. Peter was for twenty-four years
Bishop of the Church of Rome. We cannot doubt that, amongst other things
necessary for the instruction of the church, he himself delivered to
them the treasury of the sacred books, which, no doubt, had even then
begun to be read under his presidency and teaching. What are we to say
then? Did Peter the Apostle of Christ deceive the church and deliver to
them books which were false and contained nothing of truth? Are we to
believe that he knew that the Jews possessed what was true, and yet
determined that the Christians should have what was false? But perhaps
the answer will be made that Peter was illiterate, and that, though he
knew that the books of the Jews were truer than those which existed in
the church, yet he could not translate them into Latin because of his
linguistic incapacity. What then! Was the tongue of fire given by the
Holy Spirit <span id="page_476">p. 476</span> <span

Did not the Apostles speak in all languages?
