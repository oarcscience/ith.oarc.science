<span id="vi.xi.ii.xlv-p1"></span> 43. These things which you have said
are read by all who know Latin, and you yourself request them to read
them: such sayings, I mean as these: that all rational creatures, as can
be imagined by taking a single rational animal as an example, are to be
formed anew into one body, just as if the members of a single man after
being torn apart should be formed anew by the art of Æsculapius into the
same solid body as before: that there will be among them as amongst the
members of the body various offices, which you specify, but that the
body will be one, that is, of one nature: this one body made up of all
things you call the original church, and to this you give the name of
the body of Christ; and further you say that one member of this church
will be the apostate angel, that is, of course, the devil, who is to be
formed anew into that which he was first created: that man in the same
way, who is another of the members, will be recalled to the culture of
the garden of Eden as its original husbandman. All those things you say
one after the other, without bringing in the person of that ‘other’ whom
you usually introduce when you speak of such matters cautiously, and
like one treading warily, so as to make men think that you had some
hesitation in deciding matters so secret and abstruse. Origen indeed,
the man whose disciple you do not deny that you are, and whose betrayer
you confess yourself to be, always did this, as we see, in dealing with
such matters. But you, as if you were the angel speaking by the mouth of
Daniel or Christ by that of Paul, give a curt and distinct opinion on
each point, and declare to the ears of mortals all the secrets of the
ages to come. Then you speak thus to us: “O multitude of the faithful,
place no faith in any of the ancients. If Origen had some thoughts about
the more secret facts of the divine purposes, let none of you admit
them. And similarly if one of the Clements said any such things, whether
he who was a disciple of the apostle or he of the church of Alexandria
who was the master of Origen himself; yes even if they were said by the
great Gregory of Pontus, a man of apostolic virtues, or by the other
Gregory, of Nazianzus, and Didymus the seeing <span
id="fr_2921"></span>[2922](#fn_2921.md) prophet, both of them my teachers,
than whom the world has possessed none more deeply taught in the faith
of Christ. All these have erred as Origen has erred; but let them be
forgiven, for I too have erred at times, and I am now behaving myself as
a penitent, and ought to be forgiven. But Origen, since he said the
<span id="page_459">p. 459</span> <span
id="vi.xi.ii.xlv-Page_459"></span>same things which I have said, shall
receive no forgiveness though he has done penance; nay, for saying the
things which we all have said, he alone shall be condemned. He it is who
has done all the mischief; he who betrayed to us the secret of all that
we say or write, of all which makes us seem to speak learnedly, of all
that was good in Greek but which we have made bad in Latin. Of all these
let no man listen to a single one. Accept those things alone which you
find in my Commentaries, and especially in those on the Epistle to the
Ephesians, in which I have most painfully confuted the doctrines of
Origen. My researches have reached this result, that you must believe
and hold the resurrection of the flesh in this sense that men’s bodies
will be turned into spirits and their wives into men; and that before
the foundation of the world souls existed in heaven, and thence, for
reasons known to God alone, were brought down into this valley of tears,
and were inserted into this body of death; that, in the end of the ages
the whole of nature, being reasonable, will be fashioned again into one
body as it was in the beginning, that man will be recalled into
Paradise, and the apostate angel will be exalted above Peter and Paul,
since they, being but men, must be placed in the lower position of
paradise, while he will be restored to be that which he was originally
created; and that all shall together make up the Church of the first
born in heaven, and, while placed each in his separate office, shall be
equally members of Christ: but all of them taken together will be the
perfect body of Christ. Hold then to these things, my faithful and
discreet disciples, and guard them as my unhesitating definitions of
truth; but for the same doctrines pronounce your condemnation upon
Origen; so you will do well. Fare ye well.”

Alexandria. Jerome who admired him, though he was a disciple of Origen,
delights in calling him, in contrast to his blindness, the Seer.
