id="iv.viii.v.xxx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXX</span>.—*Of the church of the
Goths*.

<span id="iv.viii.v.xxx-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.v.xxx-p2.1"></span>It</span> was perceived by John that the
Scythians were involved in the Arian net; he therefore devised counter
contrivances and discovered a means of winning them over. Appointing
presbyters and deacons and readers of the divine oracles who spoke the
Scythian tongue, he assigned a church to them, <span
id="fr_917"></span>[918](#fn_917.md) and by their means won many from their
error. He used frequently himself to visit it and preach there, using an
interpreter who was skilled in both languages, and he got other good
speakers to do the same. This was his constant practice in the city, and
many of those who had been deceived he rescued by pointing out to them
the truth of the apostolic preaching.
