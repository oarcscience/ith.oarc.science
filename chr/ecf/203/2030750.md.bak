<span id="vi.xii.i.xii"></span>

<span id="vi.xii.i.xii-p1"></span> 11. Eusebius the Bishop of Cæsarea,
of whom I have made mention above, in the sixth book of his Apology for
Origen makes the same complaint against Methodius the bishop and martyr,
which you make against me in your praises of me. He says: How could
Methodius dare to write now against Origen, after having said this thing
and that of his doctrines? This is not the place in which to speak of
the martyr; one cannot discuss every thing in all places alike. Let it
suffice for the present to mention that one who was an Arian complains
of the same things in a most eminent and eloquent man, and a martyr,
which you first make a subject of praise as a friend and afterwards,
when offended turn into an accusation. I have given you an opportunity
of constructing a calumny against me if you choose, in the present
passage. “How is it,” you may ask, “that I now depreciate Eusebius,
after having in other places praised him?” The name Eusebius indeed is
different from Origen; but the ground of complaint is in both cases
identical. I praised Eusebius for his Ecclesiastical History, for his
Chronicle, for his description of the holy land; and these works <span
id="fr_3018"></span>[3019](#fn_3018.md) of his I gave to the men of the
same language as myself by translating them into Latin. Am I to be
called an Arian because Eusebius, the author of those books, is an
Arian? If you should dare to call me a heretic, call to mind your
Preface to the <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xii.i.xii-p2.1"></span>Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν</span>, in which you bear me
witness that I am of the same faith with yourself: and I at the same
time entreat you to hear patiently the expostulation of one who was
formerly your friend. You enter into a warm dispute with others, and
bandy mutual reproaches with men of your own order; whether you are
right or wrong in this is for you to say. But as against a brother even
a true accusation is repugnant to me. I do not say this to blame others;
I only say that I would not myself do it. We are separated from one
another by a vast interval of space. What sin had I committed against
you? What is my offence? Is it that I answered that I was not an
Origenist? Are you to be held to be accused because I defend myself? If
you say you are not an Origenist and have never been one, I believe your
solemn affirmation of this: if you once were one, I accept your
repentance. Why do you complain if I am what you say that you are? Or is
my offence this that I dared to translate the <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xii.i.xii-p2.2"></span>Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν</span> after you had done it,
and that my translation is supposed to detract from your work? But what
was I to do? Your laudation of me, or accusation against me, was sent to
me. Your ‘praise’ was so strong and so long that, if I had acquiesced in
it, every one would have thought me a heretic. Look at what is said in
the end of the letter which I received from Rome: <span
id="fr_3019"></span>[3020](#fn_3019.md) “Clear yourself from the suspicions
which men have imbibed against you, and convict your accuser of speaking
falsely; for if you leave him unnoticed, you will be held to assent to
his charges.” When I was pressed by such conditions, I determined to
translate these books, and I ask your attention to the answer which I
made. It was this: <span id="fr_3020"></span>[3021](#fn_3020.md) “This is
the position which my friends have made for me, (observe that I did not
say ‘my friend,’ for fear of seeming to aim at you); if I keep silence I
am to be accounted guilty: if I answer, I am accounted an enemy. Both
these conditions are hard; but of the two I will choose the easier: for
a quarrel can be healed, but blasphemy admits of no forgiveness.” You
observe that I felt this as a burden laid upon me; that I was unwilling
and recalcitrating; that I could only quiet my presentiment of the
quarrel which would ensue from this undertaking by the plea of
necessity. If you had translated the books <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xii.i.xii-p4.1"></span>Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν</span> without alluding to me,
you would have a right to complain that I had afterwards translated them
to your prejudice. But now you have no right to complain, since my work
was only an answer to the attack you had made on me under the guise
<span id="page_489">p. 489</span> <span
id="vi.xii.i.xii-Page_489"></span>of praise; for what you call praise
all understand as accusation. Let it be understood between us that you
accused me, and then you will not be indignant at my having replied. But
now suppose that you wrote with a good intention, that you were not
merely innocent but a most faithful friend, out of whose mouth no
untruth ever proceeded, and that it was quite unconsciously that you
wounded me. What is that to me who felt the wound? Am I not to take
remedies for my wound because you inflicted it without evil intention? I
am stricken down and stricken through, with a wound in the breast which
will not be appeased; my limbs which were white before are stained with
gore; and you say to me: “Pray leave your wound untouched, for fear that
I may be thought to have wounded you.” And yet the translation in
question is a reproof to Origen rather than to you. You altered for the
better the passages which you considered to have been put in by the
heretics. I brought to light what the whole Greek world with one voice
attributes to him. Which of our two views is the truer it is not for me
nor for you to judge; let each of them be touched by the censor’s rod of
the reader. The whole of that letter in which I make answer for myself
is directed against the heretics and against my accusers. How does it
touch you who profess to be both an orthodox person and my admirer, if I
am a little too sharp upon heretics, and expose their tricks before the
public? You should rejoice in my invectives: otherwise, if you are vexed
at them, you may be thought to be yourself a heretic. When anything is
written against some particular vice, but without the mention of any
name, if a man grows angry he accuses himself. It would have been the
part of a wise man, even if he felt hurt, to dissemble his consciousness
of wrong, and by the serenity of his countenance to dissipate the cloud
that lay upon his heart.
