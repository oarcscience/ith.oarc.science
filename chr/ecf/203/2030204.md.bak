<span id="iv.x.xv-p1"></span> *XV. To Silvanus the Primate.* <span
id="fr_1636"></span>[1637](#fn_1636.md)

<span id="iv.x.xv-p3"></span>I know that in my words of consolation I am
somewhat late, but it is not without reason that I have delayed to send
them, for I have thought it worth while to let the violence of your
grief take its course. The cleverest physicians will never apply their
remedies when a fever is at its height, but wait for a favourable
opportunity for using the appliances of their skill. So after reckoning
how sharp your anguish must be, I have let these few days go by, for if
I myself was so distressed and filled with such sorrow by the news, what
must not have been the sufferings of a husband and yoke-fellow, made, as
the Scripture says, one flesh, <span
id="fr_1637"></span>[1638](#fn_1637.md) at the violent sundering of the
union cemented both by time and love? Such pangs are only natural; but
let reason devise consolation by reminding you that humanity is frail
and sorrow universal, and also of the hope of the resurrection and the
will of Him who orders our lives wisely. We must needs accept the
decrees of inestimable wisdom, and own them to be for our good; for they
who reflect thus piously shall reap piety’s rewards, and so delivered
from immoderate lamentations shall pass their lives in peace. On the
other hand they whom sorrow makes its slaves will gain nothing by their
wailing, but will at once live weary lives and grieve the Guardian of us
all. Receive then, my most honoured friend, a fatherly exhortation “The
Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away. He hath done whatsoever pleased
Him. Blessed be the name of the Lord.” <span
