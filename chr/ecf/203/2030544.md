id="fr_2614"></span>[2615](#fn_2614.md) a Christian philosopher, prompt and
ready and minded to devote his time to God, chose travel as a means of
preserving the integrity of his purpose. He is said to have published
acceptable small works but I have only read one of them, a work *On
faith,* in which he justified himself to the chief priest of the city,
defending himself against those who complained and misrepresented his
travel, and asserting that he undertook his travel not through fear of
men but for the sake of God, that going forth from his land and kindred
he might become a co-heir with Abraham the patriarch.
