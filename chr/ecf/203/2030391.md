<span id="v.iii.x-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="v.iii.x-p2.1"></span>Mark <span id="fr_2373"></span>[2374](#fn_2373)
</span> the disciple and interpreter of Peter wrote a short gospel at
the request of the brethren at Rome embodying what he had heard Peter
tell. When Peter had heard this, he approved it and published it to the
churches to be read by his authority as Clemens in the sixth book of his
Hypotyposes and Papias, bishop of Hierapolis, record. Peter also
mentions this Mark in his first epistle, figuratively indicating Rome
under the name of Babylon “She who <span
id="fr_2374"></span>[2375](#fn_2374) is in Babylon elect together with
you saluteth you <span id="fr_2375"></span>[2376](#fn_2375) and so doth
Mark my son.” So, taking the gospel which he himself composed, he went
to Egypt and first preaching Christ at Alexandria he formed a church so
admirable in doctrine and continence of living that he constrained all
followers of Christ to his example. Philo most learned of the Jews
seeing the first church at Alexandria still Jewish in a degree, wrote a
book <span id="fr_2376"></span>[2377](#fn_2376) on their manner of life
as something creditable to his nation telling how, as Luke says, the
believers had all things in common <span
id="fr_2377"></span>[2378](#fn_2377) at Jerusalem, so he recorded that
he saw <span id="fr_2378"></span>[2379](#fn_2378) was done at
Alexandria, under the learned Mark. He died in the eighth year of Nero
and was buried at Alexandria, Annianus succeeding him. <span
