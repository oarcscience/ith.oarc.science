id="fr_2587"></span>[2588](#fn_2587.md) </span> the monk, the intimate
disciple of the above mentioned Macarius, educated in <span
id="fr_2588"></span>[2589](#fn_2588.md) sacred and profane literature and
distinguished, whom the book which is called the *Lives of the fathers*
mentions as a most continent and erudite man, wrote many things of use
to monks among which are these: *Suggestions against the eight principal
sins.* He was first to mention or among the first at least to teach
these setting against them eight books taken from the testimony of the
Holy Scriptures only, after the example of our Lord, who always met
<span id="page_388">p. 388</span> <span
id="v.iv.xii-Page_388"></span>his tempter with quotations from
Scripture, so that every suggestion, whether of the devil or of depraved
nature had a testimony against it. This work I have, under instructions,
translated into Latin translating with the same simplicity which I found
in the Greek. He composed also a book of *One hundred sentiments* for
those living simply as anchorites, arranged by chapters, and one of
*Fifty sentiments* for the erudite and studious, which I first
translated into Latin. The former one, translated before, I restored,
partly by retranslating and partly by emendation, so as to represent the
true meaning of the author, because I saw that the translation was
vitiated and confused by time. He composed also a doctrine of the
common-life suited to Cenobites and Synodites, <span
id="fr_2589"></span>[2590](#fn_2589.md) and to the virgin consecrated to
God, a little book suitable to her religion and sex. He published also a
few collections of opinions very obscure and, as he himself says of
them, only to be understood by the hearts of monks, and these likewise I
published in Latin. He lived to old age, mighty in signs and miracles.
