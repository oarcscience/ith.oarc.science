<span id="vi.xiii.viii-p1"></span> 7. When you hear the word “Son,” you
must not think of a nativity after the flesh; but remember that it is
spoken of an incorporeal substance, and a simple and uncompounded
nature. For if, as we said above, whether when the understanding
generates a word, or the mind sense, or light brings forth brightness
from itself, nothing of this sort is sought for, or any manner of
weakness and imperfection imagined in this kind of generation, how much
purer and more sacred ought to be our conception of the Creator of all
these!

<span id="vi.xiii.viii-p2"></span>But perhaps you say, “The generation
of which you speak is an unsubstantial generation. For light does not
produce substantial brightness, nor the understanding generate a
substantial word, but the Son of God, it is affirmed, was generated
substantially.” To this we reply, first, When in other things examples
or illustrations are used, the resemblance cannot hold in every
particular, but only in some one point for which the illustration is
employed. For instance, When it is said in the Gospel, “The kingdom of
heaven is like leaven, which a woman hid in three measures of
meal,” <span id="fr_3273"></span>[3274](#fn_3273) are we to imagine that
the kingdom of heaven is in all respects like leaven, so that like
leaven it is palpable and perishable so as to become sour and unfit for
use? Obviously the illustration was employed simply for this object—to
shew how, through the preaching of God’s word which seems so small a
thing, men’s minds could be imbued with the leaven of faith. So
likewise, when it is said, “The kingdom of heaven is like unto a net
cast into the sea, which draws in fishes of every kind,” <span
id="fr_3274"></span>[3275](#fn_3274) are we to suppose that the
substance of the kingdom of heaven is likened in all respects to the
nature of twine of which a net is made, and to the knots with which the
meshes are tied? No; the sole object of the comparison is to shew that,
as a net brings fishes to the shore from the depths of the sea, so by
the preaching of the kingdom of heaven men’s souls are liberated from
the depth of the error of this world. From whence it is evident that
examples or illustrations do not answer in every particular to the
things which they are brought to exemplify or illustrate. Otherwise, if
they were the same in all respects, they would no longer be called
examples or illustrations, but rather would be the things themselves.
