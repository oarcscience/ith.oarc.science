id="iv.viii.iii.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV</span>.—*Of the laws made by
Julian against the Christians*.

<span id="iv.viii.iii.iv-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.iii.iv-p2.1"></span>Countless</span> other deeds were dared
at that time by land and by sea, all over the world, by the wicked
against the just, for now without disguise the enemy of God began to lay
down laws against true religion. First of all he prohibited the sons of
the Galileans, for so he tried to name the worshippers of the Saviour,
from taking part in the study of poetry, rhetoric, and philosophy, for
said he, in the words of the proverb “we are shot with shafts feathered
from our own wing,” <span id="fr_616"></span>[617](#fn_616.md) for from our
own books they take arms and wage war against us.

<span id="iv.viii.iii.iv-p4"></span>After this he made another edict
ordering the Galileans to be expelled from the army.
