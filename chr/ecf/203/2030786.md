<span id="vi.xii.ii.xiv-p1"></span> 13. Do not tell me that “you have
found the same things treated by the same author in other places in a
catholic sense,” and thus send me to search through the six thousand
books of Origen which you charge the most reverend Bishop Epiphanius
with having read; but mention the passages with exactness: nor will this
suffice; you must produce the sentences word for word. Origen is no
fool, as I well know; he cannot contradict himself. The net result
arising from all this calculation is, then, that what you cut out was
not due to the heretics, but to Origen himself, and that you translated
the bad things he had written because you considered them good; and that
both the good and the bad things in the book are to be set to your
account, since you approved his writings in the Prologue.
