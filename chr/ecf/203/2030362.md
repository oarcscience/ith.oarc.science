<span id="iv.x.clxxiii-p1"></span> *CLXXII. Letter of Theodoretus to
Nestorius.* <span id="fr_2299"></span>[2300](#fn_2299.md)

<span id="iv.x.clxxiii-p6"></span>To the very reverend and religious
lord and very holy Father, Nestorius, the bishop Theodoretus sends
greeting in the Lord. Your holiness is, I think, well aware that I take
no pleasure in cultivated society, nor in the interests of this life,
nor in reputation, nor am I attracted by other sees. Had I learnt this
lesson from no other source, the very solitude of the city <span
id="fr_2300"></span>[2301](#fn_2300.md) over which I am called to preside
would suffice to teach me this philosophy. It is not indeed dis<span
id="page_345">p. 345</span> <span
id="iv.x.clxxiii-Page_345"></span>tinguished only for solitude, but also
by very many disturbances which may check the activity even of those who
most delight in them.

<span id="iv.x.clxxiii-p8"></span>Let no one therefore persuade your
holiness that I have accepted the Egyptian writings as orthodox, with my
eyes shut, because I covet any see. For really, to speak the truth,
after frequently reading and carefully examining them, I have discovered
that they are free from all heretical taint, and I have hesitated to put
any stress upon them, though I certainly have no love for their author,
who was the originator of the disturbances which have agitated the
world. For this I hope to escape punishment in the day of Judgment,
since the just Judge examines motives. But to what has been done
unjustly and illegally against your holiness, not even if one were to
cut off both my hands would I ever assent, God’s grace helping me and
supporting my infirmity. This I have stated in writing to those who
require it. I have sent to your holiness my reply to what you wrote to
me, that you may know that, by God’s grace, no time has changed me like
the centipedes and chameleons who imitate by their colour the stones and
leaves among which they live. I and all with me salute all the
Brotherhood who are with you in the Lord.
