<span id="iv.x.lix-p1"></span> *LIX. To Claudianus.* <span
id="fr_1703"></span>[1704](#fn_1703.md)

<span id="iv.x.lix-p3"></span>Sincere friendships are neither dissolved
by distance of place nor weakened by time. Time indeed inflicts
indignities on our bodies, spoils them of the bloom of their beauty, and
brings on old age; but of friendship he makes the beauty yet more
blooming, ever kindling its fire to greater warmth and brightness. So
separated as I am from your magnificence by many a day’s march, pricked
by the goad of friendship I indite you this letter of salutation. It is
conveyed by the standard-bearer Patroinus, a man <span id="page_268">p.
268</span> <span id="iv.x.lix-Page_268"></span>who on account of his
high character is worthy of all respect, for he endeavours with much
zeal to observe the laws of God. Deign, most excellent sir, to give us
by him information of your excellency’s precious health, and of the
desired fulfilment of your promise.
