<span id="vi.xi.iii.xxxii-p1"></span> 27 *a.* I ask whether you can
produce anything which I have written, by which you may convict me of
having fallen into heresy even in my youth,—anything of such a character
as the heresies of which, though you will not confess it, you now stand
convicted. I said that I had followed or imitated you in your system of
translating, in that alone and in nothing else. Yet you say that by this
I have done you all the injury which you complain of. I followed you in
such things as I saw that you had done in the Homilies on the Gospel
according to Luke. Take the passage: “My soul doth magnify the Lord, and
my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.” When you found that the
Greek Commentary had something relating to the Son of God which was not
right, you passed it over; whereas the words about the Spirit, which as
you may remember, are expressed in the ordinary way, you not only did
not pass over but added a few words of your own to make the expression
more clear. And so in the note on the words, <span
id="fr_2983"></span>[2984](#fn_2983.md) “Behold, when the voice of thy
salutation came into my ears, the babe leaped in my womb,” you render:
“Because this was not the beginning of his substance,” and you add of
your own the words “and nature,” though both these and a thousand other
things in your translations of these homilies or those on Isaiah or
Jeremiah, but more particularly in those on Ezekiel, you have now
withdrawn. But, in certain places where you found things relating to the
faith, that is the Trinity, expressed in a strange manner, you left out
words at your discretion. This mode of translation we have both of us
observed, and if any one finds fault with it, it is you who ought to
make answer, since you made use of it before me. But now the practice
which you blame is undoubtedly one for which you may yourself incur
blame. The practice of translating word for word you formerly pronounced
to be both foolish and injurious. In this I followed you. You can hardly
mean that I am to repent of this because you have now changed your
opinion, and say that you have translated the present work with literal
exactness. In previous cases you took out what was unedifying in matters
of faith, though you did so in such a way as not to excise them wholly
nor in all cases. For instance, in the Homilies on Isaiah, at the Vision
of God <span id="fr_2984"></span>[2985](#fn_2984.md) Origen refers the
words to the Son and the Holy Spirit; and so you have translated,
adding, however, words of your own which would make the passage have a
more acceptable sense. It stands thus: “Who are then these two Seraphim?
My Lord Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit:” but you add of your own, “And
do not think that there is any difference in the nature of the Trinity,
when the functions indicated by the several persons are preserved.” The
same thing I have done in a great many cases, either cutting out words
or bending them into a sounder meaning. For this you bid me do penance.
I do not think that you are of this opinion as regards yourself. If then
on this ground no penitence is due from either of us, what other things
are there of which you invite me to repent?
