<span id="iv.viii.i.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.i.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter V</span>.—*The Letter of Eusebius,
Bishop of Nicomedia, to Paulinus, Bishop of Tyre*.

<span id="iv.viii.i.vi-p2"></span>“<span class="c14"><span
id="iv.viii.i.vi-p2.1"></span>To</span> my lord Paulinus, Eusebius
sendeth greeting in the Lord.

<span id="iv.viii.i.vi-p3"></span>“The zeal of my lord Eusebius in the
cause of the truth, and likewise your silence concerning it, have not
failed to reach our ears. Accordingly, if, on the one hand, we rejoiced
on account of the zeal of my lord Eusebius; on the other we are grieved
at you, because even the silence of such a man appears like a defeat of
our cause. Hence, as it behoves not a wise man to be of a different
opinion from others, and to be silent concerning the truth, stir up, I
exhort you, within yourself the spirit of wisdom to write, and at length
begin what may be profitable to yourself and to others, specially if you
consent to write in accordance with Scripture, and tread in the tracks
of its words and will.

<span id="iv.viii.i.vi-p4"></span>“We have never heard that there are
two unbegotten beings, nor that one has been divided into two, nor have
we learned or believed that it has ever undergone any change of a
corporeal nature; but we affirm that the unbegotten is one and one also
that which exists in truth by Him, yet was not made out of His
substance, and does not at all participate in the nature or substance of
the unbegotten, entirely distinct in nature and in power, and made after
perfect likeness both of character and power to the maker. We believe
that the mode of His beginning not only cannot be expressed by words but
even in thought, and is incomprehensible not only to man, but also to
all beings superior to man. These opinions we advance not as having
derived them from our own imagination, but as having deduced them from
Scripture, whence we learn that the Son was created, established, and
begotten in the same substance and in the same immutable and
inexpressible nature as the Maker; and so the Lord says, ‘*God created
me in the beginning of His way; I was set up from everlasting; before
the hills was I brought forth* <span id="fr_327"></span>[328](#fn_327.md)
.’

<span id="iv.viii.i.vi-p6"></span>“If He had been from Him or of Him, as
a portion of Him, or by an emanation of His substance, it could not be
said that He was created or established; and of this you, my lord, are
certainly not ignorant. For that which is of the unbegotten could not be
said to have been created or founded, either by Him or by another, since
it is unbegotten from the beginning. But if the fact of His being called
the begotten gives any ground for the belief that, having come into
being of the Father’s substance, He also has from the Father likeness of
nature, we reply that it is not of Him alone that the Scriptures have
spoken as begotten, but that they also thus speak of those who are
entirely dissimilar to Him by nature. For of men it is said, ‘*I have
begotten and brought up sons, and they have rebelled against me* <span
id="fr_328"></span>[329](#fn_328.md) ;’ and in another place, ‘*Thou hast
forsaken God who begat thee* <span id="fr_329"></span>[330](#fn_329.md) ;’
and again it is said, ‘*Who begat the drops of dew* <span
id="fr_330"></span>[331](#fn_330.md) ?’ This expression does not imply that
the dew partakes of the nature of God, but simply that all things were
formed according to His will. There is, indeed, nothing which is of His
substance, yet every thing which exists has been called into being by
His will. He is God; and all things were made in His likeness, and in
the future likeness of His Word, being created of His free will. All
things were made by His means by God. All things are of God.

<span id="iv.viii.i.vi-p10"></span>“When you have received my letter,
and have revised it according to the knowledge and grace given you by
God, I beg you will write as soon as possible to my lord Alexander. I
feel confident that if you would write to him, you would succeed in
bringing him over to your opinion. Salute all the brethren in the Lord.
May you, my lord, be preserved by the grace of God, and be led to pray
for us.”

<span id="iv.viii.i.vi-p11"></span>It is thus that they wrote to each
other, in order to furnish one another with weapons against the
truth <span id="fr_331"></span>[332](#fn_331.md) . And so when the
blasphemous doctrine had been disseminated in the churches of Egypt and
of the East, disputes and contentions arose in every city, and in every
village, concerning theological dogmas. The common people looked on, and
became judges <span id="page_43">p. 43</span> <span
id="iv.viii.i.vi-Page_43"></span>of what was said on either side, and
some applauded one party, and some the other. These were, indeed, scenes
fit for the tragic stage, over which tears might have been shed. For it
was not, as in bygone days, when the church was attacked by strangers
and by enemies, but now natives of the same country, who dwelt under one
roof, and sat down at one table, fought against each other not with
spears, but with their tongues. And what was still more sad, they who
thus took up arms against one another were members of one another, and
belonged to one body.
