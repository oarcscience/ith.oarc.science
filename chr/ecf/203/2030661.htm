<p class="c24"><a name="vi.xi.ii.xxiv-p1"></A>  23. But let us come to these two Commentaries which he alone excepts from the general condemnation and renunciation which he pronounces upon all the rest of his works; we shall see with what modesty and self-restraint he conducts himself in these: Remember that it is by these alone that he has chosen to prove that he is sound in the faith, and that he is altogether opposed to Origen. Let us examine then as witnesses these two books which alone of all his writings are satisfactory to him, namely, the three books of his commentary on the Epistle of Paul to the Ephesians, and the single book (I think) on Ecclesiastes. Let us for a moment look into the one which comes forward first, the Commentary on the Epistle to the Ephesians. Even here recognize in his arguments the influence of him who is as his fellow, his partner and his brother mystic, to use his own expression.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2861"></A><A HREF="#fn_2861"><FONT SIZE="1">2862</FONT></A>
 And first of all, as to these poor weak women about whom he makes himself merry, because they say that after the resurrection they will not have their frail bodies since they will be like the angels. Let us hear what he has to say about them. In the third book of his Commentaries on the Epistle of Paul to the Ephesians, on the passage in which it is said,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2862"></A><A HREF="#fn_2862"><FONT SIZE="1">2863</FONT></A>
 &#8220;He who loveth his own wife loveth himself, for no man ever hated his own flesh;&#8221; after a few other remarks, he says:</p>  
<p class="c70"><a name="vi.xi.ii.xxiv-p4"></A>&#8220;Let us men then cherish our wives and let our souls cherish our bodies in such a way as that the wives may be turned into men and the bodies into spirits, and that there maybe no difference of sex but that, as among the angels there is neither male nor female, so we who are to be like the angels may begin here to be what it is promised that we shall be in heaven.&#8221;</p>
