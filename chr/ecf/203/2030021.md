<span id="iv.viii.i.i-p5"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.i.i-p5.1"></span>When</span> artists paint on panels and on
walls the events of ancient history, they alike delight the eye, and
keep bright for many a year the memory of the past. Historians
substitute books for panels, bright description for pigments, and thus
render the memory of past events both stronger and more permanent, for
the painter’s art is ruined by time. For this reason I too shall attempt
to record in writing events in ecclesiastical history hitherto omitted,
deeming it indeed not right to look on without an effort while oblivion
robs <span id="fr_234"></span>[235](#fn_234) noble deeds and useful
stories of their due fame. For this cause too I have been frequently
urged by friends to undertake this work. But when I compare my own
powers with the magnitude of the undertaking, I shrink from attempting
it. Trusting, however, in the bounty of the Giver of all good, I enter
upon a task beyond my own strength.

<span id="iv.viii.i.i-p7"></span>Eusebius of Palestine <span
id="fr_235"></span>[236](#fn_235) has written a history of the Church
from the time of the holy Apostles to the reign of Constantine, the
prince beloved of God. I shall begin my history from the period at which
his terminates. <span id="fr_236"></span>[237](#fn_236)
