id="iv.viii.iv.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVII</span>.—*Of the death of
the great Athanasius and the election of Petrus*.

<span id="iv.viii.iv.xvii-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.iv.xvii-p2.1"></span>At</span> Alexandria, Athanasius the
victorious, after all his struggles, each rewarded with a crown,
received release from his labours and passed away to the life which
knows no toil. Then Peter, a right excellent man, received the see. His
blessed predecessor had first selected him, and every suffrage alike of
the clergy and of men of rank and office concurred, and all the people
strove to show their delight by their acclamations. He had shared the
heavy labours of Athanasius; at home and abroad he had been ever at his
side, and with him had undergone manifold perils. Wherefore the bishops
of the neighbourhood hastened to meet; and those who dwelt in schools of
ascetic discipline left them and joined the company, and all joined in
begging that Peter might be chosen to succeed to the patriarchal chair
of Athanasius. <span id="fr_727"></span>[728](#fn_727.md)

<span id="iv.viii.iv.xvii-p3"></span> “The discussions about the year of
his death may be considered as practically closed; the Festal Index,
although its chronology is sometimes faulty, confirming the date of 373,
given in the Maffeian fragment. The exact day, we may believe, was
Thursday, May 2, on which day of the month Athanasius is venerated in
the Western Church. He had sat on the Alexandrian throne forty-six
complete years. He died tranquilly in his own house.” Canon Bright in
Dict. Christ. Biog. S.V.
