<span id="vi.xi.ii.xiv-p1"></span> 13. In the Preface to the Apology of
Pamphilus, after a few other remarks, I said:

<span id="vi.xi.ii.xiv-p2"></span>‘What the opinions of Origen are may
be gathered from the tenor of this treatise. But as for those things in
which he is found to contradict himself, I will point out how this has
come to pass in a few words which I have added at the close of this
Preface. As for us, we believe what has been delivered to us by the holy
Prophets, namely: that the holy Trinity is coeternal, and is of one
power and substance: and that the Son of God in these last days was made
man and suffered for our sins, and, in that very flesh in which he
suffered, rose from the dead; and thereby imparted the hope of a
resurrection to the whole race of men. When we speak of the resurrection
of the flesh, we do so not with any subterfuges, as some slanderously
affirm: we believe that the flesh which is to rise is this very flesh in
which we now live: we do not put one thing for another, nor when we say
body, mean something different from this flesh. If, therefore, we say
that the body is to rise again, we speak as the Apostle spoke; for this
word body was the word which he employed: Or if, again, we speak of the
flesh, our confession coincides with the words of the creed. It is a
foolish and calumnious invention to imagine that the human body can be
anything but flesh. Whether, then, we say that it is flesh according to
the common faith, or body according to the Apostle, which is to rise
again, our belief must be held, according to the definition given by the
Apostle, with the understanding that that which is to rise again is to
be raised in power and in glory, an incorruptible and a spiritual body.
While, therefore, we maintain the superior excellence of the body or
flesh which is to be, we must hold that the flesh which rises again will
be real and perfect; the actual nature of the flesh will be preserved,
while the glorious condition of the uncorrupted and spiritual body will
not be impaired. For so it is written: <span
id="fr_2841"></span>[2842](#fn_2841.md) “Corruption shall not inherit
incorruption.” This is what is preached at Jerusalem in the church of
God, by its reverend bishop John: this is what we with him confess and
hold. If any one believes or teaches anything besides this, or thinks
that we believe otherwise than as we have stated, let him be anathema.’

<span id="vi.xi.ii.xiv-p4"></span>If then any one wishes to have a
statement of our faith, he has it in these words. And whatever we read
or affirm, or whatever translations we make, we do it without prejudice
to this faith of ours, according to the words of the apostle: <span
id="fr_2842"></span>[2843](#fn_2842.md) “Prove all things, hold fast that
which is good. Abstain from every form of evil.” “And as many as follow
this rule, peace be upon them; and upon the Israel of God.”
