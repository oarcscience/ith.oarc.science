id="iv.viii.iv.xxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIX</span>.—*Of the piety of
Count Terentius*.

<span id="iv.viii.iv.xxix-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.iv.xxix-p2.1"></span>Terentius</span>, an excellent general,
distinguished for his piety, had set up trophies of victory and returned
from Armenia. On being ordered by Valens to choose a boon, he mentioned
one which it was becoming in a man nurtured in piety to choose, for he
asked not gold nor yet silver, not land, not dignity, not a house, but
that one church might be granted to them that were risking their all for
the Apostolic doctrine. Valens received the petition, but on becoming
acquainted with its contents he tore it up in a rage, and bade Terentius
beg some other boon. The count, however, picked up the pieces of his
petition, and said, “I have my reward, sir, and I will not ask another.
The Judge of all things is Judge of my intention.”
