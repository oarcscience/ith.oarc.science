<span id="iv.x.xcv-p1"></span> *XCV. To the Præfect Antiochus.* <span
id="fr_1807"></span>[1808](#fn_1807.md)

<span id="iv.x.xcv-p3"></span>You have laid aside the cares of your very
important government, but your fame flourishes among all; for they that
have reaped the fruit of your benevolence, and they are many and
everywhere, persistently extol it, proclaiming your good report in all
directions, and stirring their hearers’ tongues to join in the chorus of
acclamation. When I behold the worthy fruit which adorns with its beauty
its far-famed stem, I am delighted. For this reason I call your
excellency to greater and higher deeds, and beseech you to give heed to
the tranquillity of the churches. They have been overwhelmed with a
great storm by the contrivers of calumnies against me, and under these
circumstances the very religious bishops, making light of a long
journey, of infirmity, and of old age, have left their own flocks
unshepherded, and undertaken to travel this great distance, in their
eagerness to confute the lies told against us all. I beseech your
greatness to give them your protection, to shew care for the calumniated
East, and your forethought for the welfare of the apostolic faith. It is
only fitting that you should add this further glory to the rest of your
good deeds.
