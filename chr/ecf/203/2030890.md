<span id="vi.xiii.xlii-p1"></span> 41. This last article, which affirms
the <span class="c14"><span id="vi.xiii.xlii-p1.1"></span>Resurrection
of the Flesh</span>, concludes the sum of all perfection with succinct
brevity. Although on this point also the faith of the Church is
impugned, not only by Gentiles, but by heretics likewise. For <span
id="page_560">p. 560</span> <span
id="vi.xiii.xlii-Page_560"></span>Valentinus altogether denies the
resurrection of the flesh, so do the Manicheans, as we shewed above. But
they refuse to listen to the Prophet Isaiah when he says, “The dead
shall rise, and they who are in the graves shall be raised,” <span
id="fr_3409"></span>[3410](#fn_3409) or to most wise Daniel, when he
declares, “Then they who are in the dust of the earth shall arise, these
to eternal life, but those to shame and confusion.” <span
id="fr_3410"></span>[3411](#fn_3410) Yet even in the Gospels, which they
appear to receive, they ought to learn from our Lord and Saviour, Who
says, when instructing the Sadducees, “As touching the resurrection of
the dead: have ye not read how He saith to Moses in the Bush, I am the
God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob? Now God is not the
God of the dead but of the living.” <span
id="fr_3411"></span>[3412](#fn_3411) Where in what goes before He
declares what and how great is the glory of the resurrection, saying,
“But in the resurrection of the dead they will neither marry or be given
in marriage, but will be as the angels of God.” <span
id="fr_3412"></span>[3413](#fn_3412) But the virtue of the resurrection
confers on men an angelical state, so that they who have risen from the
earth shall not live again on the earth with the brute animals but with
angels in heaven—yet those only whose purer life has fitted them for
this—those, namely, who even now preserving the flesh of their soul in
chastity, have brought it into subjection to the Holy Spirit, and thus
with every stain of sins done away and changed into spiritual glory by
the virtue of sanctification, have been counted worthy to have it
admitted into the society of angels.
