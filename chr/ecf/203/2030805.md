<span id="vi.xii.iii.iii-p1"></span> 2. But, before I make my answer to
your letter, I must expostulate with you; you who are first in age among
the monks, good presbyter, follower of Christ; is it possible for you to
wish to kill your brother, when even to hate him is to be a homicide?
Have you learned from your Saviour the lesson that if one strike you on
the one cheek you should turn to him the other also? Did not he make
answer to the man who struck him, <span
id="fr_3154"></span>[3155](#fn_3154.md) “If I have spoken evil, bear
witness of the evil, but if well, why smitest thou me?” You threaten me
with death, which can be inflicted on us even by serpents. To die is the
lot of all, to commit homicide only of the weak man. What then? If you
do not kill me shall I never die? Perhaps I ought to be grateful to you
<span id="page_520">p. 520</span> <span
id="vi.xii.iii.iii-Page_520"></span>that you turn this necessity into a
virtue. We read of Apostles quarrelling, namely Paul and Barnabas who
were angry with each other on account of John whose surname was Mark;
those who were united by the bonds of Christ’s gospel were separated for
a voyage; but they still remained friends. Did not the same Paul resist
Peter to the face because he did not walk uprightly in the Gospel? Yet
he speaks of him as his predecessor in the Gospel, and as a pillar of
the church; and he lays before him his mode of preaching, <span
id="fr_3155"></span>[3156](#fn_3155.md) ‘lest he should be running, or had
run in vain.’ Do not children differ from parents and wives from
husbands in religious matters, while yet domestic affections remain
unimpaired. If you are as I am, why should you hate me? Even if you
believe differently, why should you wish to kill me? Is it so, that
whoever differs from you is to be slain? I call upon Jesus who will
judge what I am now writing and your letter also, as a witness upon my
conscience, that when the reverend bishop Chromatius begged me to keep
silence, my wish was to do so, and thus to make an end of our
dissensions, and to overcome evil with good. But, now that you threaten
me with destruction, I am compelled to reply; otherwise, my silence will
be taken as an acknowledgment of the crime, and you will interpret my
moderation as the sign of an evil conscience.
