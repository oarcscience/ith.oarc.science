<span id="vi.xi.ii.v-p1"></span> 4. At the very beginning of his work he
says, “As if they could not be heretics by themselves, without me.” I
must first show that, whether with him or without him, we are no
heretics: then, when our status is made clear, we shall be safe from
having the infamous imputation hurled at us from other men’s reports. I
was already living in a monastery, where, as both he and all others
know, about 30 years ago, I was made regenerate by Baptism, and received
the seal of the faith at the hands of those saintly men,
Chromatius, <span id="fr_2822"></span>[2823](#fn_2822.md) Jovinus <span
id="fr_2823"></span>[2824](#fn_2823.md) and Eusebius, <span
id="fr_2824"></span>[2825](#fn_2824.md) all of them now bishops, well-tried
and highly esteemed in the church of God, one of whom was then a
presbyter of the church under Valerian of blessed memory, the second was
archdeacon, the third Deacon, and to me a spiritual father, my teacher
in the creed and the articles of belief. These men so taught me, and so
I believe, namely, that the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit are of
one Godhead, of one Substance: a Trinity coeternal, inseparable,
incorporeal, invisible, incomprehensible, known to itself alone as it
truly is in its perfection: For “No man <span
id="fr_2825"></span>[2826](#fn_2825.md) knoweth the Son but the Father,
neither knoweth any man the Father but the Son”: and the Holy Spirit is
he who “searcheth <span id="fr_2826"></span>[2827](#fn_2826.md) the deep
things of God”: that this Trinity, therefore, is without all bodily
visibility, but that it is with the eye of the understanding that the
Son and the Holy Spirit see the Father even as the Father sees the Son
and the Holy Spirit; and further, that in this Trinity there is no
diversity except that one is Father, another Son and a third Holy
Spirit. There is a Trinity as touching the distinction of persons, a
unity in the reality of the Substance. We received, further, that the
only begotten Son of God, through whom in the beginning all existing
things were made, whether visible or invisible, in these last days took
upon him a human body and Soul, and was made man, and suffered for our
salvation; and the third day he rose again from <span id="page_437">p.
437</span> <span id="vi.xi.ii.v-Page_437"></span>the dead in that very
flesh which had been laid in the sepulchre; and in that very same flesh
made glorious he ascended into the heavens, whence we look for his
coming to judge the quick and the dead. But further we confess that he
gave us hope that we too should rise in a similar manner, so that we
believe that our resurrection will be in the same manner and process,
and in the same form, as the resurrection of our Lord himself from the
dead: that the bodies which we shall receive will not be phantoms or
thin vapours, as some slanderously affirm that we say, but these very
bodies of ours in which we live and in which we die. For how can we
truly believe in the resurrection of the flesh, unless the very nature
of flesh remains in it truly and substantially? It is then without any
equivocation, that we confess the resurrection of this real and
substantial flesh of ours in which we live.
