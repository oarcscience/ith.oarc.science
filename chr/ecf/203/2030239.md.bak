<span id="iv.x.l-p1"></span> *L. To the Archimandrite Gerontius.* <span
id="fr_1695"></span>[1696](#fn_1695.md)

<span id="iv.x.l-p3"></span>The characters of souls are often depicted
in words and their unseen forms revealed; so now your reverence’s letter
exhibits the piety of your holy soul. Your waiting for that sentence,
your anxiety, your search for advocates and preparation for a defence,
clearly indicate your soul’s zeal about divine things. We on the
contrary are in a manner inactive and sleepy; we are nurtured in
idleness, and stand in need of much assistance from prayers. Give them
to us, O man beloved of God, that now at all events we may wake up and
give some care to the soul.
