id="v.iv.lxxxiii-p2.1"></span>Cyrus, <span
id="fr_2716"></span>[2717](#fn_2716.md) </span> an Alexandrian by race, and
a physician by profession, at first a philosopher then a monk, an expert
speaker, at first wrote elegantly and powerfully against Nestorius, but
afterwards, since he began to inveigh against him too
intemperately <span id="fr_2717"></span>[2718](#fn_2717.md) and dealt in
syllogism rather than Scripture, he began to foster the Timothean
doctrine. Finally he declined to accept the decree of the council of
Chalcedon, and did not think the doctrine that after the incarnation the
Son of God comprehended two natures, was to be acquiesced in.

*“nevertheless” inveigh* or *“inveighs less”* or *“more”* and *“is
found”* for *“inveigh.”* T 21 25 a Wolfenb. agree in reading *in illo
minus invenitur* instead of *in illum nimius inventur.* Norimb has same
with nimius instead of minus. The reading of T 21 25 a Wolfenb. thus
reinforced and in view of the fact of the easy confusion of *minus* and
*nimius* in transcribing, is the most probable reading, but it is hard
to decide and harder still to make sense of it.
