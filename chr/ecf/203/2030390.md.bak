<span id="v.iii.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="v.iii.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII.</span>

<span id="v.iii.ix-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="v.iii.ix-p2.1"></span>Luke <span
id="fr_2365"></span>[2366](#fn_2365.md) </span> a physician of Antioch, as
his writings indicate, was not unskilled in the Greek language. An
adherent of the apostle Paul, and companion of all his journeying, he
wrote a *Gospel,* concerning which the same Paul says, “We send with him
a brother whose praise in the gospel is among all the churches” <span
id="fr_2366"></span>[2367](#fn_2366.md) and to the Colossians “Luke the
beloved physician salutes you,” <span
id="fr_2367"></span>[2368](#fn_2367.md) and to Timothy “Luke only is with
me.” <span id="fr_2368"></span>[2369](#fn_2368.md) He also wrote another
excellent volume to which he prefixed the title *Acts of the Apostles,*
a history which extends to the second year of Paul’s sojourn at Rome,
that is to the fourth <span id="fr_2369"></span>[2370](#fn_2369.md) year of
Nero, from which we learn that the book was composed in that same city.
Therefore the *Acts of Paul and Thecla* <span
id="fr_2370"></span>[2371](#fn_2370.md) and all the fable about the lion
baptized by him we reckon among the apocryphal writings, <span
id="fr_2371"></span>[2372](#fn_2371.md) for how is it possible that the
inseparable companion of the apostle in his other affairs, alone should
have been ignorant of this thing. Moreover Tertullian who lived near
those times, mentions a certain presbyter in Asia, an adherent of the
apostle Paul, <span id="fr_2372"></span>[2373](#fn_2372.md) who was
convicted by John of having been the author of the book, <span
id="page_364">p. 364</span> <span id="v.iii.ix-Page_364"></span>and who,
confessing that he did this for love of Paul, resigned his office of
presbyter. Some suppose that whenever Paul in his epistle says
“according to my gospel” he means the book of Luke and that Luke not
only was taught the gospel history by the apostle Paul who was not with
the Lord in the flesh, but also by other apostles. This he too at the
beginning of his work declares, saying “Even as they delivered unto us,
which from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word.”
So he wrote the gospel as he had heard it, but composed the Acts of the
apostles as he himself had seen. He was buried at Constantinople to
which city, in the twentieth year of Constantius, his bones together
with the remains of Andrew the apostle were transferred.
