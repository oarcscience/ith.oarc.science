<span id="iv.viii.v.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.v.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter III</span>.—*Of the dissension
caused by Paulinus; of the innovation by Apollinarius of Laodicea, and
of the philosophy of Meletius*.

<span id="iv.viii.v.iii-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.v.iii-p2.1"></span>It</span> has been already related how
the defenders of the apostolic doctrines were divided into two parties;
how immediately after the conspiracy formed against the great
Eustathius, one section, in abhorrence of the Arian abomination,
assembled together by themselves with Paulinus for their bishop, while,
after the ordination of Euzoius, the other party separated themselves
from the impious with the excellent Meletius, underwent the perils
previously described, and were guided by the wise instructions which
Meletius gave them. Besides these Apollinarius of Laodicea constituted
himself leader of a third party, and though he assumed a mask of piety,
and appeared to defend apostolic doctrines, he was soon seen to be an
open foe. About the divine nature he used unsound arguments, and
originated the idea of certain degrees of dignities. He also had the
hardihood to render the mystery of the incarnation <span
id="fr_810"></span>[811](#fn_810.md) imperfect and affirmed that the
reasonable soul, which is entrusted with the guidance of the body, was
deprived of the salvation effected. For according to his argument God
the Word did not assume this soul, and so neither granted it His healing
gift, nor gave it a portion of His dignity. Thus the earthly body is
represented as worshipped by invisible powers, while the soul which is
made in the image of God has remained below invested with the dishonour
of sin. <span id="fr_811"></span>[812](#fn_811.md) Many more errors did he
utter in his stumbling and blinded intelligence. At one time even he was
ready to confess that of the Holy Virgin the flesh had been taken, at
another time he represented it to have come down from heaven with God
the Word, and yet again that He had been made flesh and took nothing
from us. Other vain tales and trifles which I have thought it
superfluous to repeat he mixed up with God’s gospel promises. By
arguments of this nature he not only filled his own friends with
dangerous <span id="page_133">p. 133</span> <span
id="iv.viii.v.iii-Page_133"></span>doctrine but even imparted it to some
among ourselves. As time went on, when they saw their own
insignificance, and beheld the splendour of the Church, all except a few
were gathered into the Church’s communion. But they did not quite put
away their former unsoundness, and with it infected many of the sound.
This was the origin of the growth in the Church of the doctrine of the
one nature of the Flesh and of the Godhead, of the ascription to the
Godhead of the Passion of the only begotten, and of other points which
have bred differences among the laity and their priests. But these
belong to a later date. At the time of which I am speaking, when Sapor
the General had arrived and had exhibited the imperial edict, Paulinus
affirmed that he sided with Damasus, and Apollinarius, concealing his
unsoundness, did the same. The divine Meletius, on the other hand, made
no sign, and put up with their dispute. Flavianus, of high fame for his
wisdom, who was at that time still in the ranks of the presbyterate, at
first said to Paulinus in the hearing of the officer “If, my dear
friend, you accept communion with Damasus, point out to us clearly how
the doctrines agree, for he though he owns one substance of the Trinity
openly preaches three essences. <span id="fr_812"></span>[813](#fn_812.md)
You on the contrary deny the Trinity of the essences. Shew us then how
these doctrines are in harmony, and receive the charge of the churches,
as the edict enjoins.” After so silencing Paulinus by his arguments he
turned to Apollinarius and said, “I am astonished, my friend, to find
you waging such violent war against the truth, when all the while you
know quite clearly how the admirable Damasus maintains our nature to
have been taken in its perfection by God the Word; but you persist in
saying the contrary, for you deprive our intelligence of its salvation.
If these our charges against you be false, deny now the novelty that you
have originated; embrace the teaching of Damasus, and receive the charge
of the holy shrines.”

<span id="iv.viii.v.iii-p6"></span>Thus Flavianus in his great wisdom
stopped their bold speech with his true reasoning.

<span id="iv.viii.v.iii-p7"></span>Meletius, who of all men was most
meek, thus kindly and gently addressed Paulinus. “The Lord of the sheep
has put the care of these sheep in my hands: you have received the
charge of the rest: our little ones are in communion with one another in
the true religion. Therefore, my dear friend, let us join our flocks;
let us have done with our dispute about the leading of them, and,
feeding the sheep together, let us tend them in common. If the chief
seat is the cause of strife, that strife I will endeavour to put away.
On the chief seat I will put the Holy Gospel; let us take our seats on
each side of it; should I be the first to pass away, you, my friend,
will hold the leadership of the flock alone. Should this be your lot
before it is mine, I in my turn, so far as I am able, will take care of
the sheep.” So gently and kindly spoke the divine Meletius. Paulinus did
not consent. The officer passed judgment on what had been said and gave
the churches to the great Meletius. Paulinus still continued at the head
of the sheep who had originally seceded.

id="iv.viii.v.iii-p4.3"></span>) Apollinarius attributed to Christ a
human body and a human soul or *anima animans* shared by man with
brutes, but not the reasonable soul, spirit or *anima rationalis.* In
place of this he put the Divine Logos. The Word, he said, was made Flesh
not Spirit, God was manifest in the Flesh not Spirit.
