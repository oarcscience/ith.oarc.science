Dionysius a single epistle *On the incarnation of Our Lord,* which at
that time was regarded as useful against those who asserted that, as by
incarnation there were two persons in Christ, so also there were two
natures, but now this too is regarded as injurious for it nourishes the
Eutychian and Timothean heresies.
