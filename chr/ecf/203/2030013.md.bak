<span id="iv.iv.vii-p1"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.iv.vii-p1.1"></span>VII.—The Condemnation of “the Three
Chapters.”</span>

<span id="iv.iv.vii-p2"></span>A sketch of the life of Theodoret might
well be supposed to terminate with his death. But it can hardly be
regarded as complete without a brief supplementary notice of the
posthumous controversy which has contributed to his fame in
ecclesiastical history. The Council of Chalcedon was designed to give
rest to the Church, and to undo a great wrong, and catholic common sense
has since vindicated its decisions. But it was not to be supposed that
the opinions and passions which had achieved a combined triumph at
Ephesus in 449 would die away and disappear in consequence of the
imperial and synodical action of 451. The face of the world was
changing. The vandal Genseric captured and pillaged Rome. The Teutonic
races were pushing to a foremost place, and accepting first of all an
Arian Christianity. Clovis represented orthodoxy almost alone.
Theodoric, the Arian Ostrogoth, mastered Italy. Then the turning tide
saw Rome once again a city of sole empire, but not the chief city. The
victories of Belisarius made of Rome a suburb of Constantinople, and
empire and theology swayed and were swayed by the policy of Justinian
and the palace plots of Theodora. All through monophysitism had had its
friends and defenders. Metropolitans, monks, and mobs had anathematized
one another for nearly a century. At Alexandria Dioscorus had won almost
a local canonization, and the patriarch Timotheus, nicknamed “the Cat,”
had left a strong monophysite party, consolidated under Peter the
Stutterer as the “acephali.” <span id="fr_96"></span>[97](#fn_96.md) At
Antioch Peter the Fuller had anathematized all who refused to accept the
Shibboleth he appended to the Trisagion, “who wast crucified on our
account.” Leo, Marcian’s successor on the Eastern throne, had followed
Marcian’s theology, and Zeno, Leo; but the usurper Basiliscus had seen
elements of strength in a bold bid for monophysite support. Zeno, on the
fall of Basiliscus, had attempted to atone the disunited sections of
Christendom by the henoticon, or edict of unity, but the henoticon had
been for years a watchword of division. Anastasius had favoured the
Eutychians. And in his reign Theodoret had been twice condemned, at the
synods of Constantinople and Sidon, in 499 and 512. <span
id="fr_97"></span>[98](#fn_97.md)

<span id="iv.iv.vii-p5"></span>Justin I., the unlettered barbarian,
supported the Chalcedonians, but in 544 Belisarius <span id="page_13">p.
13</span> <span id="iv.iv.vii-Page_13"></span>had made the Eutychian
Vigilius bishop of Rome. When Justinian aspired to become a second
Constantine, and give theological as well as civil law to the world, it
was proposed to condemn in a fifth œcumenical council certain so-called
Nestorian writings, on the plea that such a condemnation might reconcile
the opponents of Chalcedon. The writings in question were the Letter of
Ibas of Edessa to Maris, praising Theodore of Mopsuestia; the works of
Theodore himself, and the writings of Theodoret against Cyril. These
three literary monuments were known as “the Three Chapters.” <span
id="fr_98"></span>[99](#fn_98.md) Of the controversy of the Three Chapters
it has been said that it “filled more volumes than it was worth
lines.” <span id="fr_99"></span>[100](#fn_99.md) The Council satisfied
nobody. Pope Vigilius, detained at Constantinople and Marmora with
something of the same violence with which Napoleon I. detained Pius VI.
at Valence, declined to preside over a gathering so exclusively
oriental. The West was outraged by the constitution of the synod,
irrespective of its decisions. The Monophysites were disappointed that
the credit of Chalcedon should be even nominally saved by the nice
distinction which damaged the writings, but professed complete agreement
with the council which had refused to damn the writers. The orthodox
wanted no slur cast upon Chalcedon, and, however fenced, the
condemnation of the Three Chapters indubitably involved such a slur.
Practically, the decrees of the fourth and fifth councils are mutually
inconsistent, and it is impossible to accept both. Theodoret was
reinstated at Chalcedon in spite of what he had written, and what he had
written was anathematized at Constantinople in spite of his
reinstatement.

<span id="iv.iv.vii-p8"></span>The xiii Canon of the fifth Council runs
as follows, “if any one defends the impious writings of Theodoret which
he published against the true faith, against the first holy synod of
Ephesus and against the holy Cyril and his twelve chapters; and all that
he wrote in defence of the impious Theodorus and Nestorius, and others
who held the same opinions as the aforesaid Theodorus and Nestorius,
defending them and their impiety, and accordingly calling impious the
doctors of the church who confess the union according to hypostasis of
God the Word in the flesh; and does not anathematize these writings and
those who have held or do hold similar opinions, above all those who
have written against the true faith and the holy Cyril and his twelve
chapters, and have remained to the day of their death in such impiety;
let him be anathema.”

<span id="iv.iv.vii-p9"></span>In this condemnation the works certainly
included are Theodoret’s “Objections to Cyril’s Chapters,” some of his
letters, and, among his lost works, the “Pentalogium,” namely five books
on the Incarnation written against Cyril and his supporters at Ephesus,
of which fragments are preserved, and two allocutions against Cyril
delivered at Chalcedon in 431, of which portions exist in the acts of
the fifth Council, and do not exhibit Theodoret at his best.

<span id="iv.iv.vii-p10"></span>The Council has at least preserved to us
an interesting little record of the survival at Cyrus of the memory of
her great bishop, for it appears that at the seventh collation, held at
the end of May, notice was taken of an enquiry ordered by Justinian
respecting a statue or portrait of Theodoret which was said to have been
carried in procession into his cathedral town, by Andronicus a presbyter
and George a deacon. <span id="fr_100"></span>[101](#fn_100.md) A more
important tribute to his memory is the fact that, though it officially
anathematized writings some of which, composed in the thick of the
fight, and soiled with its indecorous dust, Theodoret himself may well
have regretted and condemned, the Council advisedly abstained from
directly condemning a bishop whose character and person were protected
by the notorious iniquity of the robber council that had deposed him,
the friendship of the illustrious Leo, and the solemn vindication of the
church in Synod at Chalcedon, as well as by his own confession of the
faith, his repudiation of the errors of Nestorius, and the stainless
beauty and pious close of his long life.

<span id="iv.iv.vii-p12"></span>No better reconciliation between
Chalcedon and Constantinople can be proffered than that which Garnerius
quotes from the letter said to have been written by Gregory the Great,
though sent in the name of Pelagius II, to the Illyrians on the fifth
council, “It is the part of unwarrantable rashness to defend those
writings of Theodoret which it is noto<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>
<span id="iv.iv.vii-Page_14"></span>rious that Theodoret himself
condemned in his subsequent profession of the right faith. So long as we
at once accept himself and repudiate the erroneous writings which have
long remained unknown we do not depart in any way from the decision of
the sacred synod, because so long as we only reject his heretical
writings, we, with the synod, attack Nestorius, and with the synod
express our veneration for Theodoret in his right confession. His other
writings we not only accept, but use against our foes.” <span

<span id="iv.iv.vii-p6"></span> Dean Milman (Lat. Christ. iv, 4),
following in the wake of Gibbon, remarks that “the church was not now
disturbed by the sublime, if inexplicable, dogmas concerning the nature
of God, the Persons of the Trinity, or the union of the divine and human
nature of Christ, concerning the revelations of Scripture, or even the
opinions of the ancient fathers. The orthodoxy or heterodoxy of certain
writings by bishops but recently dead became the subject of imperial
edicts of a fifth so-called Œcumenic Council, held at Constantinople,
and a religious war between the East and the West,” but it was on their
explanation of sublime if inexplicable dogmas that the orthodoxy or
heterodoxy of these bishops depended, and so far as the subject matter
of dispute is concerned, the position in 553 was not very different from
that of 451. In both cases the church was moved at once by honest
conviction and partisan passion; the state was influenced partly by a
healthy desire to promote peace through out the empire, partly by the
meaner ambition of posing as theological arbitrator.
