<span id="iv.viii.v.xxii-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.v.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXII</span>.—*Of Theophilus,
bishop of Alexandria, and what happened at the demolition of the idols
in that city*.

<span id="iv.viii.v.xxii-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.v.xxii-p2.1"></span>The</span> illustrious Athanasius was
succeeded by the admirable Petrus, Petrus by Timotheus, and Timotheus by
Theophilus, a man of sound wisdom and of a lofty courage. <span
id="fr_893"></span>[894](#fn_893.md) By him Alexandria was set free from
the error of idolatry; for, not content with razing the idols’ temples
to the ground, he exposed the tricks of the priests to the victims of
their wiles. For they had constructed <span id="page_148">p. 148</span>
<span id="iv.viii.v.xxii-Page_148"></span>statues of bronze and wood
hollow within, and fastened the backs of them to the temple walls,
leaving in these walls certain invisible openings. Then coming up from
their secret chambers they got inside the statues, and through them gave
any order they liked and the hearers, tricked and cheated, obeyed. <span
id="fr_894"></span>[895](#fn_894.md) These tricks the wise Theophilus
exposed to the people.

<span id="iv.viii.v.xxii-p6"></span>Moreover he went up into the temple
of Serapis, which has been described by some as excelling in size and
beauty all the temples in the world. <span
id="fr_895"></span>[896](#fn_895.md) There he saw a huge image of which the
bulk struck beholders with terror, increased by a lying report which got
abroad that if any one approached it, there would be a great earthquake,
and that all the people would be destroyed. The bishop looked on all
these tales as the mere drivelling of tipsy old women, and in utter
derision of the lifeless monster’s enormous size, he told a man who had
an axe to give Serapis a good blow with it. <span
id="fr_896"></span>[897](#fn_896.md) No sooner had the man struck, than all
the folk cried out, for they were afraid of the threatened catastrophe.
Serapis however, who had received the blow, felt no pain, inasmuch as he
was made of wood, and uttered never a word, since he was a lifeless
block. His head was cut off, and forthwith out ran multitudes of mice,
for the Egyptian god was a dwelling place for mice. Serapis was broken
into small pieces of which some were committed to the flames, but his
head was carried through all the town in sight of his worshippers, who
mocked the weakness of him to whom they had bowed the knee.

<span id="iv.viii.v.xxii-p9"></span>Thus all over the world the shrines
of the idols were destroyed. <span id="fr_897"></span>[898](#fn_897.md)

<span id="iv.viii.v.xxii-p4"></span> In the museum at Naples is shewn
part of the statue of Diana, found near the Forum at Pompeii. In the
back of the head is a hole by means of a tube in connexion with
which,—the image standing against a wall,—the priests were supposed to
deliver the oracles of the Huntress-Maid.

<span id="iv.viii.v.xxii-p5"></span>It is curious to note that just at
this period when the pagan idols were destroyed, faint traces of image
worship begin to appear in the Church. In another two centuries and a
half it was becoming common, and in this particular point, Christianity
relapsed into paganism. Littledale *Plain Reasons,* p. 47.

<span id="iv.viii.v.xxii-p7"></span> “A great number of plates of
different metals, artificially joined together, composed the majestic
figure of the deity who touched on either side of the walls of the
sanctuary. Serapis was distinguished from Jupiter by the basket or
bushel which was placed on his head, and by the emblematic monster which
he held in his right hand; the head and body of a serpent branching into
three tails, which were again terminated by the triple heads of a dog, a
lion, and a wolf.” Gibbon, on the authority of Macrobius Sat. i. 20.

<span id="iv.viii.v.xxii-p8"></span> Gibbon quotes the story of Augustus
in Plin. Nat. Hist. xxxiii. 24. “Is it true,” said the emperor to a
veteran at whose home he supped, “that the man who gave the first blow
to the golden statue of Anaitis was instantly deprived of his eyes and
of his life?” “I want that man,” replied the clear sighted veteran, “and
you now sup on one of the legs of the goddess.” cf. the account in Bede
of the destruction by the priest Coify of the great image of the Saxon
God at the Goodmanham in Yorkshire.

<span id="iv.viii.v.xxii-p10"></span> “Some twenty years before the
Roman armies withdrew from Britain the triumph of Christianity was
completed. Then a question occurs whether archæology casts any light on
the discomfiture of Roman paganism in Britain. In proof of the
affirmative a curious fact has been adduced, that the statues of pagan
divinities discovered in Britain are always or mostly broken. At
Binchester, for instance, the Roman Vinovium, not far from Durham, there
was found among the remains of an important Roman building a stone
statue of the goddess Flora, with its legs broken, lying face downward
across a drain as a support to the masonry above. It would certainly not
be wise to press archæological facts too far; but the broken gods in
Britain curiously tally with the edicts of Theodosius and the shattered
Serapis at Alexandria.” Hole *Early Missions,* p. 24.
