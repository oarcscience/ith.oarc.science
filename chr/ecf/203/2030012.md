<span id="iv.iv.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iv.iv.vi-p1.1"></span>VI.—Retirement after Chalcedon, and
Death.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.vi-p2"></span>Some doubt hangs over the question whether
after his vindication at Chalcedon Theodoret resumed his labours at
Cyrus, or occupied himself with literary work in the congenial seclusion
of Nicerte. Garnerius makes it about the time of his quitting Chalcedon
that Sporacius charged him with the duty of writing on the
Heresies, <span id="fr_85"></span>[86](#fn_85) and if so his five books
on this subject would seem to have constituted the first fruit of his
comparative leisure. Sporacius <span id="fr_86"></span>[87](#fn_86) he
styles his “Christ-loving Son,” and no doubt owed something to the aid
of the influential “Comes domesticorum,” who was present at Chalcedon,
when the question of his admission to the Council was being agitated. To
this period has also been referred his commentary on the
Octateuch. <span id="fr_87"></span>[88](#fn_87) On Dr. Newman’s
statement that Theodoret made over the charge of his diocese to Hypatius
(one of his chorepiscopi, who had been entrusted with his appeal to Pope
Leo) and retired into his monastery, and there regaining the peace which
he had enjoyed in youth, passed from the peace of the Church to the
peace of eternity, Canon Venables <span id="fr_88"></span>[89](#fn_88)
remarks that there is no authority for so pleasing a picture, and that
Tillemont <span id="fr_89"></span>[90](#fn_89) contradicts it
altogether. Garnerius quotes his congratulation to Sabinianus <span
id="fr_90"></span>[91](#fn_90) on leaving Perrha as suggestive of what
conduct he might have preferred.

<span id="iv.iv.vi-p9"></span>It is at least certain that during this
period he received a long and sympathetic letter from <span
id="page_12">p. 12</span> <span id="iv.iv.vi-Page_12"></span>Leo, from
which it is clear that the Roman bishop reposed great confidence in
him. <span id="fr_91"></span>[92](#fn_91) It is characteristic of one in
whom the mere man was merged in the theologian and ecclesiastic that, as
of the year of his birth, so of the year of his death, we have no
specific information, and are compelled to form our conclusions on
evidence which though valuable, is not overwhelming. Theodorus Lector,
the composer of the Historia Tripartita, in the 6th century,
states <span id="fr_92"></span>[93](#fn_92) that Theodoret prepared a
sepulchral urn for the burial of the famous ascetic Jacobus; that he
predeceased Jacobus; but that Jacobus was buried in it. <span
id="fr_93"></span>[94](#fn_93) Evagrius <span
id="fr_94"></span>[95](#fn_94) mentions Jacobus Syrus as still living
when the Emperor Leo sent his Circular Letter to the bishops in 458,
though then he must have been in extreme old age. And Gennadius, who
lived not long after Theodoret, says that he died in the reign of Leo.
The evidence is not strong. Theodoret may have died some years before
Jacob. But Gennadius probably knew. On the whole we may conclude that
there is some probability that Theodoret survived till 458; none that he
lived longer. Like Lucius Cary, Viscount Falkland, to whom, in his
isolation, Dean Stanley <span id="fr_95"></span>[96](#fn_95) compares
him, Theodoret must have expired with the cry of “Peace, Peace,” in his
heart, if not on his lips. Garnerius is careful to prove that he died in
“the peace of the Church,” and appeals in support of this contention to
the laudatory testimony of Popes Vigilius, Pelagius I., Pelagius II.,
and Gregory the Great. The peace of the Church, in the narrower sense,
has not always been accorded to holy men and women who have assuredly
departed this life in the faith and fear of their Lord. In its truer and
holier connotation it coincides with a state in which we trust we may
contemplate the godly old man of Cyrus, forgetting the storms that had
beaten now and again on the life he was leaving behind him, and stepping
quietly into the calm of the windless haven of souls,—the Peace not of
man, but of God.

decision of the Council that Constantinople was to enjoy honorary
precedence next after old Rome and practical equality and independence,
in that the metropolitans of Pontus, Asia, and Thrace were to be
ordained by the patriarch of Constantinople, Leo manages to write to
Theodoret, *par parenthèse,* of the Roman See as one *“quam cœteris
omnium Dominus statuit prœsidere.”* If in *“statuit”* Leo had meant to
refer to a Divine Providence overruling history, and in *“prœsidere”* to
the fact that Rome was for many years the capital of the world, his
remark would have been open to little objection. But he meant something
quite different.
