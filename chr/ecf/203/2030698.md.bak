<span id="vi.xi.iii.xiv-p1"></span> 10 (2). I would not, therefore, have
you distress yourself overmuch about these points, nor expose yourself
needlessly either to penance or to condemnation. But there is a matter
of real importance, as to which I can neither excuse nor defend you;
namely, a statement openly made by you which is not only heathenish but
beyond all heathenism and impiety—the statement in the treatise which I
have mentioned above, <span id="fr_2954"></span>[2955](#fn_2954.md) that
God has a mother-in-law. Has anything so profane as this or so impious
been said even by any of the heathen poets? It would be a foolish
question to ask whether you find anything of the kind in the holy
Scriptures. I only ask whether ‘your’ Flaccus or Maro, whether Plautus
or Terence, or even whether any writer of Satires among all their
unclean and immodest sayings has ever uttered such an outrage against
God. No doubt you were led astray by the fact that the girl to whom you
addressed the treatise <span id="fr_2955"></span>[2956](#fn_2955.md) was
called the bride of Christ: and hence you thought that her mother
according to the flesh might be called the mother-in-law of God. You did
not recollect that such things are said not according to the order of
the flesh, but according to the grace of the spirit. For a woman is
called the bride of Christ because the word of God is united in a kind
of mystic wedlock with the human soul. But if the mother of the girl in
question is related to Christ by this spiritual connexion, she herself
should be called the bride of Christ, not the mother-in-law of God. As
it is, you might as well go on to call the father of the girl God’s
father-in-law, and her sister his sister-in-law, or to call the girl
herself God’s daughter-in-law. The fact is, you were so anxious to
appear completely possessed of <span id="page_466">p. 466</span> <span
id="vi.xi.iii.xiv-Page_466"></span>the eloquence of Plautus or of
Cicero, that you forgot that the Apostle speaks of the whole church,
parents and children, mothers and daughters, brothers and sisters, all
together, as one virgin or bride, when he says, <span
id="fr_2956"></span>[2957](#fn_2956.md) “I determined this very thing, to
present you as a chaste virgin to one man, which is Christ.” But you
boast that you follow not Paul’s but Porphyry’s Introduction, and, since
he wrote his impious and sacrilegious books against Christ and against
God, you have fallen, through his introduction, into this abyss of
blasphemy.

<span id="vi.xi.iii.xiv-p3"></span> The word *“Dei”* has crept in,
apparently, wrongly. If it stands the meaning would be, ‘To whom you
were teaching the word of God,’ or the allusion may be to <span
