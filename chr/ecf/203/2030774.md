<span id="vi.xii.ii.ii-p1"></span> 1. Thus far I have made answer about
my crimes, and indeed in defence of my crimes, which my crafty encomiast
formerly urged against me, and which his disciples still constantly
press. I have done so not as well as I ought but as I was able, putting
a check upon my complaints, for my object has been not so much to accuse
others as to defend myself. I will now come to his Apology, <span
id="fr_3080"></span>[3081](#fn_3080.md) by which he strives to justify
himself to Anastasius, Bishop of the City of Rome, and, in order to
defend himself, constructs a mass of calumnies against me. His love for
me is like that which a man who has been carried away by the tempest and
nearly drowned in deep water feels for the strong swimmer at whose foot
he clutches: he is determined that I shall sink or swim with him.

[Next: A criticism on Rufinus' Apology to Anastasius. His excuses for
not coming to Rome are absurd. His parents are dead and the journey is
easy. No one ever heard before of his being imprisoned or exiled for the
faith.](2030775.md)
