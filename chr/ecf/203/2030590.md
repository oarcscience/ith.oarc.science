id="v.iv.lxxi-p2.1"></span>Hilary, <span
id="fr_2690"></span>[2691](#fn_2690.md) </span> bishop of the church at
Arles, a man learned in Holy Scriptures, was devoted to poverty, and
earnestly anxious to live in narrow circumstances, not only in
religiousness of mind, but also in labour of body. To secure this estate
of poverty, this man of noble race and very differently brought up,
engaged in farming, though it was beyond his strength, and yet did not
neglect spiritual matters. He was an acceptable teacher also, and
without regard to persons administered correction to all. <span
id="fr_2691"></span>[2692](#fn_2691.md) He published some few things,
brief, but showing immortal genius, and indicating an erudite mind, as
well as capacity for vigorous speech; among these that work which is of
so great practical value to many, his *Life of Saint Honoratus,* his
predecessor. He died during the reign of Valentinianus and Martianus.
