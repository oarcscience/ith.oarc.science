<span id="iv.viii.ii.xii"></span>

<span id="iv.viii.ii.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.ii.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII</span>.—*Council of Milan*.

<span id="iv.viii.ii.xii-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.ii.xii-p2.1"></span>After</span> the death of Constans,
Magnentius assumed the chief authority over the Western empire; and, to
repress his usurpation, Constantius repaired to Europe. But this war,
severe as it was, did not put an end to the war against the Church.
Constantius, who had embraced Arian tenets and readily yielded to the
influence of others, was persuaded to convoke a council at Milan <span
id="fr_516"></span>[517](#fn_516) , a city of Italy, and first to compel
all the assembled bishops to sign the deposition enacted by the
iniquitous judges at Tyre; and then, since Athanasius had been expelled
from the Church, to draw up another confession of faith. The bishops
assembled in council on the receipt of the imperial letter, but they
were far from acting according to its directions. On the contrary, they
told the emperor to his face that what he had commanded was unjust and
impious. For this act of courage they were expelled from the Church, and
relegated to the furthest boundaries of the empire.

<span id="iv.viii.ii.xii-p4"></span>The admirable Athanasius thus
mentions this circumstance in his Apology <span
id="fr_517"></span>[518](#fn_517) :—“Who,” he writes, “can narrate such
atrocities as they have perpetrated? A short time ago when the Churches
were in the enjoyment of peace, and when the people were assembled for
prayer, Liberius <span id="fr_518"></span>[519](#fn_518) , bishop of
Rome, Paulinus, bishop of the metropolis of Gaul <span
id="fr_519"></span>[520](#fn_519) , Dionysius, bishop of the metropolis
of Italy <span id="fr_520"></span>[521](#fn_520) , Luciferus, bishop of
the metropolis of the Isles of Sardinia <span
id="fr_521"></span>[522](#fn_521) , and Eusebius, bishop of one of the
cities of Italy <span id="fr_522"></span>[523](#fn_522) , who were all
exemplary bishops and preachers of the truth, were seized and driven
into exile, for no other cause than because they could not assent to the
Arian heresy, nor sign the false accusation which had been framed
against us. It is unnecessary that I should speak of the great Hosius,
that aged <span id="fr_523"></span>[524](#fn_523) and faithful confessor
of the faith, for every one knows that he also was sent into banishment.
Of all the bishops he is the most illustrious. What council can be
mentioned in which he did not preside, and convince all present by the
power of his reasoning? What Church does not still retain the glorious
memorials of his protection? Did any one ever go to him sorrowing, and
not leave him rejoicing? Who ever asked his aid, and did not obtain all
that he desired? Yet they had the boldness to attack this great man,
simply because, from his knowledge of the impiety of their calumnies, he
refused to affix his signature to their artful accusations against us.”

<span id="iv.viii.ii.xii-p12"></span>From the above narrative will be
seen the violence of the Arians against these holy men. Athanasius also
gives in the same book an account of the numerous plots formed by the
<span id="page_77">p. 77</span> <span
id="iv.viii.ii.xii-Page_77"></span>chiefs of the Arian faction against
many others:—“Did any one,” said he, “whom they persecuted and got into
their power ever escape from them without suffering what injuries they
pleased to inflict? Was any one who was an object of their search found
by them whom they did not subject to the most agonizing death, or else
to the mutilation of all his limbs? The sentences inflicted by the
judges are all attributable to these heretics; for the judges are but
the agents of their will, and of their malice. Where is there a place
which contains no memorial of their atrocities? If any one ever differed
from them in opinion, did they not, like Jezebel, falsely accuse and
oppress him? Where is there a church which has not been plunged in
sorrow by their plots against its bishop? Antioch has to mourn the loss
of Eustathius, the faithful and the orthodox <span
id="fr_524"></span>[525](#fn_524) . Balaneæ weeps for Euphration <span
id="fr_525"></span>[526](#fn_525) ; Paltus <span
id="fr_526"></span>[527](#fn_526) and Antaradus <span
id="fr_527"></span>[528](#fn_527) for Cymatius and Carterius. Adrianople
has been called to deplore the loss of the well-beloved Eutropius <span
id="fr_528"></span>[529](#fn_528) , and of Lucius his successor, who was
repeatedly loaded with chains, and expired beneath their weight <span
id="fr_529"></span>[530](#fn_529) . Ancyra, Berœa, and Gaza had to mourn
the absence of Marcellus <span id="fr_530"></span>[531](#fn_530) ,
Cyrus <span id="fr_531"></span>[532](#fn_531) and Asclepas <span
id="fr_532"></span>[533](#fn_532) , who, after having suffered much
ill-treatment from this deceitful sect, were driven into exile.
Messengers were sent in quest of Theodulus <span
id="fr_533"></span>[534](#fn_533) and Olympius <span
id="fr_534"></span>[535](#fn_534) , bishops of Thrace, as well as of me
and of the presbyters of my diocese; and had they found us, we should no
doubt have been put to death. But at the very time that they were
planning our destruction we effected our escape, although they had sent
letters to Donatus, the proconsul, against Olympius, and to
Philagrius <span id="fr_535"></span>[536](#fn_535) , against me.”

<span id="iv.viii.ii.xii-p25"></span>Such were the audacious acts of
this impious faction against the most holy Christians. Hosius was the
bishop of Cordova, and was the most highly distinguished of all those
who assembled at the council of Nicæa; he also obtained the first place
among those convened at Sardica.

<span id="iv.viii.ii.xii-p26"></span>I now desire to insert in my
history an account of the admirable arguments addressed by the far-famed
Liberius, in defence of the truth, to the emperor Constantius. They are
recorded by some of the pious men of that period in order to stimulate
others to the exercise of similar zeal in divine things. Liberius had
succeeded Julius, the successor of Silvester, in the government of the
church of Rome.

id="iv.viii.ii.xii-p2.2"></span>

<span id="iv.viii.ii.xii-p3"></span> Athanasius was condemned at Arles
(353) as well as at Milan in 355. At the latter place Constantius
affected more than his father’s infallibility, and exclaimed, “What I
will, be that a Canon.” Ath. *Hist. Ar.* §33.

<span id="fn_517"></span>[76:518](2030066.htm#fr_517) <span

<span id="iv.viii.ii.xii-p6"></span> For the persecution and vacillation
of Liberius, “one of the few Popes that can be charged with heresy”
(Principal Barmby in *Dict. Christ. Biog.* s.v.), see also Ath. *Hist.
Ar.* §35 et seqq.

<span id="fn_519"></span>[76:520](2030066.htm#fr_519) <span

<span id="iv.viii.ii.xii-p7"></span> Treves. Dionysius was the successor
of St. Maximinus and a firm champion of orthodoxy. Cf. Sulp. Sev. II.
52.

id="iv.viii.ii.xii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="iv.viii.ii.xii-p9"></span> Calaris (Cagliari). Luciferus, a
vehement defender of Athanasius, was banished to Eleutheropolis in
Palestine. Mr. Ll. Davies (*Dict. Christ. Biog.* s.v.), thinks the
traditional story of the imprisonment of Luciferus at Milan, to prevent
his outspoken advocacy of Athanasius, shews internal evidence of
probability.

<span id="fn_522"></span>[76:523](2030066.htm#fr_522) <span
id="iv.viii.ii.xii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="iv.viii.ii.xii-p10"></span> Eusebius, bishop of Vercellæ
(Vercelli), was a staunch Athanasian. He was banished to Scythopolis,
where the bishop Patrophilus (cf. Book I. chapter VI. and XX.), a
leading Arian, was, he says, his “jailer.” (Vide his letters.)

<span id="fn_523"></span>[76:524](2030066.htm#fr_523) <span
id="iv.viii.ii.xii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="iv.viii.ii.xii-p11"></span> The epithet <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.viii.ii.xii-p11.1"></span>εὐγηρότατος</span>
felicitously describes the honoured old age of the bishop of Cordova—he
was now a hundred years old (*Hist. Ar.* §45)—before his pitiable lapse.
He was sent to Sirmium (Mitrovitz).

<span id="fn_524"></span>[77:525](2030066.htm#fr_524) <span

<span id="iv.viii.ii.xii-p14"></span> Euphration is mentioned also in
*Hist. Ar.* §5. Balaneæ is now Banias on the coast of Syria.

<span id="fn_526"></span>[77:527](2030066.htm#fr_526) <span

<span id="iv.viii.ii.xii-p15"></span> Now Boldo, a little to the N. of
Banias.

<span id="iv.viii.ii.xii-p17"></span> “A good and excellent man,” Ath.
*Hist. Ar.* §5.

id="iv.viii.ii.xii-p18.1"></span>

<span id="iv.viii.ii.xii-p19"></span> On the question of the orthodoxy
of Marcellus of Ancyra (Angora), vide the conflicting opinions of Bp
Lightfoot (*Dict. Christ. Biog.* ii. 342), and Mr. Ffoulkes (id. iii.
810). Ath. (*Apol. contra Ar.* §47) says of the Council of Sardica, “The
book of our brother Marcellus was also read, by which the frauds of the
Eusebians were plainly discovered…his faith was found to be correct,”
cf. p. 67, note.

<span id="fn_531"></span>[77:532](2030066.htm#fr_531) <span
id="iv.viii.ii.xii-p19.1"></span>

<span id="iv.viii.ii.xii-p20"></span> The successor of Eustathius at
Berœa, cf. p. 41, note 65. Socrates says the statement that Cyrus
accused Eustathius of Sabellianism is an Arian calumny (Soc. i. 24; ii.
9).

<span id="fn_532"></span>[77:533](2030066.htm#fr_532) <span
id="iv.viii.ii.xii-p20.1"></span>

<span id="iv.viii.ii.xii-p21"></span> Asclepas or Æsculapius was at Tyre
(p. 62), and was deposed on the charge of overturning an altar, <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.viii.ii.xii-p21.1"></span>ὡ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.viii.ii.xii-p21.2"></span>ς</span> <span

<span id="iv.viii.ii.xii-p23"></span> Bishop of Ænos in Thrace, now
Enos. (*Hist. Ar.* §19.) Here was shown the tomb of Polydorus. Plin. 4,
11, 18. Virgil (Æn. iii. 18) makes Æneas call it Æneadæ, but see
Conington’s note.

<span id="iv.viii.ii.xii-p24"></span> Philagrius was præfect of Egypt
<span class="c14"><span id="iv.viii.ii.xii-p24.1"></span>a.d.</span>
335–340. Ath. (*Ep. Encyc.*) calls him “a persecutor of the Church and
her virgins, an apostate of bad character.”
