<p class="c31"><a name="iv.x.xc-p3"></A>I have passed through the contests of my prime. I see before me the confines of old age, and have expected as an old man to have more honour given me. But I am a mark for the shafts of slander, and am driven to meet by defence accusations levelled against me. Under these circumstances, I beseech your excellency not to believe the lies of my accusers. Had I been living a life of silence, there might have been room for the suspicion of unorthodoxy. But I am continually discoursing in the churches, and therefore have, by God&#146;s grace, innumerable witnesses to the soundness of what I teach. I follow the laws and rules of the apostles. I test my teaching by applying to it, like a rule and measure, the faith laid down by the holy and blessed Fathers at Nic&aelig;a. If any one maintain that I hold any contrary opinion, let him accuse me face to face; let him not slander me in my absence. It is fair that even the defendant should have an opportunity of speech, and meet with his defence the charges brought against him, and that then and not till then should the judges lawfully pronounce their sentence. This favour I beg <A NAME="page_284"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 284</FONT></A> <a name="iv.x.xc-Page_284"></A>through your excellency&#146;s assistance. If any men wish to condemn me unheard, I accept with willingness even their unjust sentence. For I wait for the judgment of the Master, where we need neither witnesses nor accusers. Before Him, as says the divine Apostle, &#8220;all things are naked and opened.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1799"></A><A HREF="#fn_1799"><FONT SIZE="1">1800</FONT></A>
