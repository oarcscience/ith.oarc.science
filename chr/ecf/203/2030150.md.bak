<span id="iv.viii.v.x-Page_139"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.v.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter X</span>.—*Synodical letter of
Damasus bishop of Rome against Apollinarius and Timotheus.*

<span id="iv.viii.v.x-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.v.x-p2.1"></span>When</span> the most praiseworthy Damasus
had heard of the rise of this heresy, he proclaimed the condemnation not
only of Apollinarius but also of Timotheus his follower. The letter in
which he made this known to the bishops of the Eastern empire I have
thought it well to insert in my history.

<span id="iv.viii.v.x-p3"></span>Letter of Damasus bishop of Rome.

<span id="iv.viii.v.x-p4"></span>“Most honourable sons: Inasmuch as your
love renders to the apostolic see the reverence which is its due, accept
the same in no niggard measure for yourselves. <span
id="fr_849"></span>[850](#fn_849.md) For even though in the holy church in
which the holy apostle sat, and taught us how it becomes us to manage
the rudder which has been committed to us, we nevertheless confess
ourselves to be unworthy of the honour, we yet on this very account
strive by every means within our power if haply we may be able to
achieve the glory of that blessedness. Know then that we have condemned
Timotheus, the unhallowed, the disciple of Apollinarius the heretic,
together with his impious doctrine, and are confident that for the
future his remains will have no weight whatever. But if that old
serpent, though smitten once and again, still revives to his own
destruction, who though he exists without the church never ceases from
the attempt by his deadly venom to overthrow certain unfaithful men, do
you avoid it as you would a pest, mindful ever of the apostolic
faith—that, I mean, which was set out in writing by the Fathers at
Nicæa; do you remain on steady ground, firm and unmoved in the faith,
and henceforward suffer neither your clergy nor laity to listen to vain
words and futile questions, for we have already given a form, that he
who professes himself a Christian may keep it, the form delivered by the
Apostles, as says St. Paul, ‘if any one preach to you another gospel
than that you have received let him be Anathema.’ <span
id="fr_850"></span>[851](#fn_850.md) For Christ the Son of God, our Lord,
gave by his own passion abundant salvation to the race of men, that he
might free from all sin the whole man involved in sin. If any one speaks
of Christ as having had less of manhood or of Godhead, he is full of
devils’ spirits, and proclaims himself a child of hell.

<span id="iv.viii.v.x-p7"></span>“Why then do you again ask me for the
condemnation of Timotheus? Here, by the judgment of the apostolic see,
in the presence of Peter, bishop of Alexandria, he was condemned,
together with his teacher, Apollinarius, who will also in the day of
judgment undergo due punishment and torment. But if he succeeds in
persuading some less stable men, as though having some hope, after by
his confession changing the true hope which is in Christ, with him shall
likewise perish whoever of set purpose withstands the order of the
Church. May God keep you sound, most honoured sons.”

<span id="iv.viii.v.x-p8"></span>The bishops assembled in great Rome
also wrote other things against other heresies which I have thought it
necessary to insert in my history.

<span id="iv.viii.v.x-p5"></span> This rendering seems the sense of the
somewhat awkward Greek of the text, and obviates the necessity of
adopting Valesius’ conjecture that the “nobis” of the original Latin had
been altered by a clerical error into “vobis.” If we read nobis, we may
translate “you shew it in no niggard measure to ourselves.”
