<span id="vi.xvii-p4"></span>————————————

<span id="vi.xvii-p5"></span>The whole exposition of the thirty-sixth,
thirty-seventh and thirty-eighth Psalms is ethical in its character,
being designed to enforce more correct methods of life; and teaches at
one time the way of conversion and repentance, at another that of
purification and of progress. I have therefore thought it well to
translate it into Latin for you, my dearest son Apronianus, having first
arranged it in nine of the short sermons which are called in Greek
Homilies, and incorporated it into one whole; and thus this discourse
which in all its parts aims at the correction and the advancement of the
moral life, is collected into a single volume. My translation will at
all events be of use so far as to put the reader without effort in
possession of the meaning of the author, which is here fully laid open,
and to bring home to him the simplicity of life which he enjoins with
clearness of thought and in simple words; and thus the voice of prophecy
may reach not men alone but also god-fearing women, and lend subtlety to
the minds of the simple. Yet I fear that pious lady, who is my daughter
but your sister in Christ, may think that she owes me no thanks for my
work if it brings her nothing but puzzling thoughts and thorny
questions: for the human body could hardly hold together if divine
providence had formed it of bones and muscles alone without blending
with them the ease and grace of the softer tissues.
