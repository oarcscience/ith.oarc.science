<span id="vi.xiii.xlv-p1"></span> 44. But that you may not suppose this
to be a novel doctrine peculiar to Paul, I will adduce also what the
Prophet Ezekiel foretold by the Holy Ghost. “Behold,” saith he, “I will
open your graves and bring you forth out of your graves.” <span
id="fr_3420"></span>[3421](#fn_3420.md) Let me recall, further, how Job,
who abounds in mystical language, plainly predicts the resurrection of
the dead. “There is hope for a tree; for if it be cut down it will
sprout again, and its shoot shall never fail. But if its root have waxed
old in the earth, and the stock thereof be dead in the dust, yet through
the scent of water it will flourish again, and put forth shoots as a
young plant. But man, if he be dead, is he departed and gone? And mortal
man, if he have fallen, shall he be no more?” <span
id="fr_3421"></span>[3422](#fn_3421.md) Dost thou not see, that in these
words he is appealing to men’s sense of shame, as it were, and saying,
“Is mankind so foolish, that when they see the stock of a tree which has
been cut down shooting forth again from the ground, and dead wood again
restored to life, they imagine their own case to have no likeness to
that of wood or trees?” But to convince you that Job’s words are to be
read as a question, when he says, “But mortal man when he hath fallen
shall he not rise again?” take this proof from what follows; for he adds
immediately, “But if a man be dead, shall he live?” <span
id="fr_3422"></span>[3423](#fn_3422.md) And presently afterwards he says,
“I will wait till I be made again;” <span
id="fr_3423"></span>[3424](#fn_3423.md) and afterwards he repeats the same:
“Who shall raise again upon the earth my skin, which is now draining
this cup of suffering?” <span id="fr_3424"></span>[3425](#fn_3424.md)
