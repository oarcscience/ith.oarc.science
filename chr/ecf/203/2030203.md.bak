<span id="iv.x.xiv-p1"></span> <span id="page_254">p. 254</span> <span
id="iv.x.xiv-Page_254"></span>*XIV. To Alexandra.*

<span id="iv.x.xiv-p2"></span>Had I only considered the character of the
loss which you have sustained, I should have wanted consolation myself,
not only because I count that what concerns you concerns me, be it
agreeable or otherwise, but because I did so dearly love that admirable
and truly excellent man. But the divine decree has removed him from us
and translated him to the better life. I therefore scatter the cloud of
sorrow from my soul, and urge you, my worthy friend, to vanquish the
pain of your sorrow by the power of reason, and to bring your soul in
this hour of need under the spell of God’s word. Why from our very
cradles do we suck the instruction of the divine Scriptures, like milk
from the breast, but that, when trouble falls upon us, we may be able to
apply the teaching of the Spirit as a salve for our pain? I know how
sad, how very grievous it is, when one has experienced the worth of some
loved object, suddenly to be deprived of it, and to fall in a moment
from happiness to misery. But to them that are gifted with good sense,
and use their powers of right reason, no human contingency comes quite
unforeseen; nothing human is stable; nothing lasting; nor beauty, nor
wealth, nor health, nor dignity; nor any of all those things that most
men rank so high. Some men fall from a summit of opulence to lowest
poverty; some lose their health and struggle with various forms of
disease; some who are proud of the splendour of their lineage drag the
crushing yoke of slavery. Beauty is spoilt by sickness and marred by old
age, and very wisely has the supreme Ruler suffered none of these things
to continue nor abide, with the intent that their possessors, in fear of
change, may lower their proud looks, and, knowing how all such
possessions ebb and flow, may cease to put their confidence in what is
short lived and fleeting, and may fix their hopes upon the Giver of all
good. I am aware, my excellent friend, that you know all this, and I beg
you to reflect on human nature; you will find that it is mortal, and
received the doom of death from the beginning. It was to Adam that God
said “Dust thou art and to dust thou shalt return.” <span
id="fr_1628"></span>[1629](#fn_1628.md) The giver of the law is He that
never lies, and experience witnesses to His truth. Divine Scripture
tells us “all men have one entrance into life and the like going
out,” <span id="fr_1629"></span>[1630](#fn_1629.md) and every one that is
born awaits the grave. And all do not live a like length of time; some
men come to an end all too soon; some in the vigour of manhood, and some
after they have experienced the trials of old age. Thus, too, they who
have taken on them the marriage yoke are loosed from it, and it must
needs be that either husband first depart or wife reach this life’s end
before him. Some have but just entered the bridal chamber when their lot
is weeping and lamentation; some live together a little while. Enough to
remember that the grief is common to give reason ground for overcoming
grief. Besides all this, even they who are mastered by bitterest sorrow
may be comforted by the thought that the departed was the father of
sons; that he left them grown up; that he had attained a very high
position, and in it, so far from giving any cause for envy, made men
love him the more, and left behind him a reputation for liberality, for
hatred of all that is bad, for gentleness and indeed for every kind of
moral virtue. <span id="fr_1630"></span>[1631](#fn_1630.md)

<span id="iv.x.xiv-p9"></span>But what excuse for despondency will be
left us if we take to heart God’s own promises and the hopes of
Christians; the resurrection, I mean, eternal life, continuance in the
kingdom, and all that “eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have
entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for
them that love Him”? <span id="fr_1631"></span>[1632](#fn_1631.md) Does not
the Apostle say emphatically, “I would not have you to be ignorant
brethren concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not even as
others which have no hope”? <span id="fr_1632"></span>[1633](#fn_1632.md) I
have known many men who even without hope have got the better of their
grief by the force of reason alone, and it would indeed be extraordinary
if they who are supported by such a hope should prove weaker than they
who have no hope at all. Let us then, I implore you, look at the end as
a long journey. When he went on a journey we used indeed to be sorry,
but we waited his return. Now let the separation sadden us indeed in
some degree, for I am not exhorting what is contrary to human nature,
but do not let us wail as over a corpse; let us rather congratulate him
on his setting forth and his departure hence, because he is now free
from a world of uncertainties, and fears no further change of soul or
body or of corporeal conditions. The strife now ended, he waits for his
reward. Grieve not overmuch for orphanhood and widowhood. We have a
greater Guardian <span id="page_255">p. 255</span> <span
id="iv.x.xiv-Page_255"></span>whose law it is that all should take good
care of orphans and widows and about whom the divine David says “The
Lord relieveth the fatherless and widow, but the way of the wicked He
turneth upside down.” <span id="fr_1633"></span>[1634](#fn_1633.md) Only
let us put the rudders of our lives in His hands, and we shall meet with
an unfailing Providence. His guardianship will be surer than can be that
of any man, for His are the words “Can a woman forget her sucking child
that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? Yet will I
not forget thee.” <span id="fr_1634"></span>[1635](#fn_1634.md) He is
nearer to us than father and mother for He is our Maker and Creator. It
is not marriage that makes fathers, but fathers are made fathers at His
will.

<span id="iv.x.xiv-p14"></span>I am now compelled thus to write because
my bonds <span id="fr_1635"></span>[1636](#fn_1635.md) do not suffer me to
hasten to you, but your most God-loving and most holy bishop is able
unaided to give all consolation to your very faithful soul by word and
by deed, by sight and by communication of thought and by that spiritual
and God-given wisdom of his whereby I trust the tempest of your grief
will be lulled to sleep.
