id="iv.viii.v.xxxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXIII</span>.—*Of the
ambassage of Chrysostom to Gainas*.

<span id="iv.viii.v.xxxiii-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.v.xxxiii-p2.1"></span>Then</span> when every one else was
passed over because of the universal panic, this great chief was
persuaded to undertake the ambassage. He took no heed of the dispute
which has been related, nor of the ill feeling which it had engendered,
and readily set out for Thrace. No sooner did Gainas hear of the arrival
of the envoy than he bethought him of the bold utterance which he had
made on behalf of true religion. He came eagerly from a great distance
to meet him, placed his right hand upon his eyes, and brought his
children to his saintly knees. So is it the nature of goodness to put
even those who are most opposed to it to the blush and vanquish them.
But envy could not endure the bright rays of his philosophy. It put in
practice its wonted wiles and deprived of his eloquence and his wisdom
the imperial city—aye indeed the whole world. <span

<span id="iv.viii.v.xxxiii-p3"></span> It is not clear where the mission
of Chrysostom to Gainas should be placed. Gainas attacked the capital by
sea and by land, but his Goths were massacred in their own church, and
he was repulsed. He was finally defeated and slain in Jan. 401.
