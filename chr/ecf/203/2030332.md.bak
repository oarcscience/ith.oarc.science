<span id="iv.x.cxliii-p1"></span> *CXLII. To the Same.*

<span id="iv.x.cxliii-p2"></span>I have already addressed your reverence
in another letter, and have delivered it to your much respected
brethren. Now again I address your holiness. I am induced to do so both
by your admirable life, and by the praiseworthy zeal which you have
shewn on behalf of the apostolic faith, fearless alike of imperial power
and of episcopal combination. For granted that the majority of the
council consented under coercion, still they did confirm the new fangled
heresy by their signatures. Your holiness, however, was shaken by none
of these things, but abided by the ancient doctrines which the Lord, by
means of both the prophets and the apostles, has taught the churches to
hold. These decrees I pray that I may preserve, and keep to the end my
faith and confession in one Father, one Son and one Holy Ghost. For the
incarnation of the only begotten made no addition to the number of the
Trinity. Even after the incarnation the Trinity is still a Trinity. This
is the teaching I have received from the beginning; this has been my
faith; in this was I baptized; this have I preached; in this have I
baptized, this I continue to hold. Of them that utter a lie about the
Father the Lord has said “When he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his
own,” <span id="fr_1991"></span>[1992](#fn_1991.md) for what is said of the
teacher is appropriate to the disciples. So these men who employ lies
against me speak of their own, and do not describe what is mine. I am
comforted by my Master’s words “Blessed are ye when men shall revile you
and persecute you and shall say all manner <span id="page_310">p.
310</span> <span id="iv.x.cxliii-Page_310"></span>of evil against you
falsely for my sake. Rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is your
reward in heaven.” <span id="fr_1992"></span>[1993](#fn_1992.md)

<span id="iv.x.cxliii-p5"></span>I entreat your piety to pray that I may
not have my part among the wrong doers, but among them that suffer wrong
on account of the truth of the Gospels.
