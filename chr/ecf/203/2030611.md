<span id="v.iv.xcii-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="v.iv.xcii-p2.1"></span>Theodulus, <span
id="fr_2734"></span>[2735](#fn_2734) </span>  <span
id="fr_2735"></span>[2736](#fn_2735) a presbyter in Coelesyria is said
to have written many works, but the only one which has come to my hand,
is the one which he composed *On the harmony of divine Scripture,* that
is, the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments, against the ancient
heretics who on account of discrepancies in the injunctions of the
ritual, say that the God of the Old Testament is different <span
id="page_401">p. 401</span> <span id="v.iv.xcii-Page_401"></span>from
the God of the New. In this work he shows it to have been by the
dispensation of one and the same God, the author of both Scriptures,
that one law should be given by Moses to those of old in a ritual of
sacrifices and in judicial laws, and another to us through the presence
of Christ in the holy mysteries and future promises, that they should
not be considered different, but as dictated by one spirit and one
author, since these things which if observed only according to the
letter, would slay, if observed according to the spirit, would give life
to the mind. This writer died three years since <span
