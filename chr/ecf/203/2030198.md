<span id="iv.x.ix-p1"></span> *IX. To an Anonymous Correspondent.*

<span id="iv.x.ix-p2"></span>Your piety is annoyed and distressed at the
sentence passed on me unjustly and without a trial. I am comforted that
you are so feeling. Had I been justly condemned I should have been sorry
at having given my judges reasonable grounds for what they have done,
but, as it is, my conscience is quite clear, and I feel joyful and
exultant and look forward to the remission of other sins on account of
this injustice. Naboth lives in men’s memories only because he suffered
that unjust death. Only pray that we be not abandoned of God and let the
enemy continue to do his worst. God’s good will is enough to make me
very cheerful and if He is on my side I despise all my troubles as
trifles. <span id="fr_1624"></span>[1625](#fn_1624.md)

the imperial Edict of March 449 relegating Theodoret to the limits of
his own diocese. cf. Epp. 79. 80.
