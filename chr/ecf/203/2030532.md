id="fr_2590"></span>[2591](#fn_2590.md) presbyter of the church at Antioch,
a cautious investigator and clever of tongue, wrote against the
Apollinarians and Anomians *On the incarnation of the Lord,* fifteen
books containing as many as fifteen thousand verses, in which he showed
by the clearest reasoning and by the testimony of Scripture that just as
the Lord Jesus had a plenitude of deity, so he had a plenitude of
humanity. He taught also that man consists only of two substances, soul
and body and that sense and spirit are not different substances, but
inherent inborn faculties of the soul through which it is inspired and
has rationality and through which it makes the body capable of feeling.
Moreover the fourteenth book of this work treats wholly of the uncreated
and alone incorporeal and ruling nature of the holy Trinity and of the
rationality of animals which he explains in a devotional spirit, on the
authority of Holy Scriptures. In the fifteenth volume he confirms and
fortifies the whole body of his work by citing the traditions of the
fathers.
