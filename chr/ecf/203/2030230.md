<span id="iv.x.xli-p1"></span> *XLI. To Claudianus.* <span
id="fr_1678"></span>[1679](#fn_1678.md)

<span id="iv.x.xli-p3"></span>The divine Celebration has as usual
conferred on us its spiritual boons; but the sour fruits of sin have not
suffered us to enjoy them with gladness. They have had their usual
results; in the beginning they caused thorns, caltrops, sweats, toil and
pain to sprout; at the present moment sin sets the earth quaking against
us, and makes nations rise against us on every side. And we lament
because we force the good Lord, who is wishful to do us good, to do us
ill, and compel Him to inflict punishment.

<span id="iv.x.xli-p4"></span>Yet when we bethink us of the unfathomable
depths of His pity we are comforted, and trust that the Lord will not
cast off His people, neither will He forsake His inheritance. <span
id="fr_1679"></span>[1680](#fn_1679.md) While saluting your magnificence I
beseech you to give me news of your much-wished for health.
