<span id="iv.x.clxxiv-p1"></span> *CLXXIII. Letter to Andreas, Monk of
Constantinople.* <span id="fr_2301"></span>[2302](#fn_2301.md)

<span id="iv.x.clxxiv-p3"></span>“God is faithful who will not suffer
you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation
also make a way to escape that ye may be able to bear it,” <span
id="fr_2302"></span>[2303](#fn_2302.md) and convicts falsehood,—although
now refuted assertion of the falsehood is approved,—and the power of
truth has been shewn. For, lo, they, who by their impious reasoning had
confused the natures of our Saviour Christ, and dared to preach one
nature, and therefore insulted the most holy and venerable Nestorius,
high priest of God, their mouths held, as the prophet says, with bit and
bridle <span id="fr_2303"></span>[2304](#fn_2303.md) and turned from wrong
to right, have once again learnt the truth, adopting the statement of
him who in the cause of truth has borne the brunt of the battle. For
instead of one nature they now confess two, anathematizing all who
preach mixture and confusion. They adore the impassible Godhead of
Christ; they attribute passion to the flesh; they distinguish between
the terms of the Gospels, ascribing the lofty and divine to the Godhead,
and the lowly to the manhood. Such are the writings now brought from
Egypt.
