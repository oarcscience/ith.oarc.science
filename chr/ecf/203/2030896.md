<span id="vi.xiii.xlviii-p1"></span> 47. Nor let this promise seem to
you contrary to the natural structure of the body. For if we believe,
according to what is written, that God took clay of the earth and made
man, and that the origin of our body was this, that, by the will of God,
earth was changed into flesh, why does it seem absurd to you or contrary
to reason if, on the same principles on which earth is said to be
advanced to all animal body, an animal body in turn should be believed
to be advanced to a spiritual body? These things and many like these you
will find in the divine Scriptures concerning the resurrection of the
righteous. There will be given to sinners also, as we said above, a
condition of incorruption and immortality at the resurrection, that, as
God assigns this state to the righteous for perpetuity of glory, so He
may assign the same to sinners for prolongation of confusion and
punishment. For this also the Prophet’s words, which we referred to
above, state clearly: “Many shall rise from the dust of the earth, some
to life eternal, and others to confusion and eternal shame.” <span
