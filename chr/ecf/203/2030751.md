<span id="vi.xii.i.xiii-p1"></span> 12. Otherwise, if everything which
goes against Origen and his followers is supposed to be said by me
against you, we must suppose that the letters of the popes Theophilus
and Epiphanius and the rest of the bishops which at their desire I
lately translated <span id="fr_3021"></span>[3022](#fn_3021.md) are meant
to attack you and tear you to pieces; we must suppose too that the
rescripts of the Emperors which order that the Origenists should be
banished from Alexandria and from Egypt have been written at my
dictation. The abhorrence shown by the Pontiff of the city of Rome
against these men was nothing but a scheme of mine. The outburst of
hatred which immediately after your translation blazed up through the
whole world against Origen who before had been read without prejudice
was the work of my pen. If I have got all this power, I wonder that you
are not afraid of me. But I really acted with extreme moderation. In my
public letter <span id="fr_3022"></span>[3023](#fn_3022.md) I took every
precaution to prevent your supposing that anything in it was directed
against you; but I wrote at the same time a short letter <span
id="fr_3023"></span>[3024](#fn_3023.md) to you, expostulating with you on
the subject of your ‘praises.’ This letter my friends did not think it
right to send you, because you were not at Rome, and because, as they
tell me, you and your companions were scattering accusations of things
unworthy of the Christian profession about my manner of life. But I have
subjoined a copy of it to this book, so that you may understand what
pain you gave me and with what brotherly self-restraint I bore it.
