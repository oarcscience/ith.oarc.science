<span id="iv.viii.iv.xxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.iv.xxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVII</span>.—*Of what bishops
were at this time distinguished in Asia and Pontus.*

<span id="iv.viii.iv.xxvii-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.iv.xxvii-p2.1"></span>Among</span> the bishops were the two
Gregorii, the one of Nazianzus <span id="fr_795"></span>[796](#fn_795)
and the other of Nyssa, <span id="fr_796"></span>[797](#fn_796) the
latter the brother and the former the friend and fellow worker of the
great Basilius. These were foremost champions of piety in Cappadocia;
and in front rank with them was Peter, born of the same parents with
Basilius and Gregorius, who though not having received like them a
foreign education, like them lived a life of brilliant distinction.

<span id="iv.viii.iv.xxvii-p5"></span>In Pisidia Optimus, <span
id="fr_797"></span>[798](#fn_797) in Lycaonia Amphilochius, <span
id="fr_798"></span>[799](#fn_798) fought in the front rank on behalf of
their fathers’ faith, and repelled the enemies’ assaults.

<span id="iv.viii.iv.xxvii-p8"></span>In the West Damasus, <span
id="fr_799"></span>[800](#fn_799) Bishop of Rome, and Ambrosius,
entrusted with the government of Milan, smote those who attacked them
from afar. In conjunction with these, bishops forced to dwell in remote
regions, confirmed their friends and undid their foes by writings—thus
pilots able to cope with the greatness of the storm were granted by the
governor of the universe. Against the violence of the foe He set in
battle array the virtue of His captains, and provided means meet to ward
off the troubles of these difficult times, and not only were the
churches granted this kind of protection by their loving Lord, but
deemed worthy of yet another kind of guidance.

<span id="iv.viii.iv.xxvii-p3"></span> Gregorius of Nazianzus (in
Cappadocia, on the Halys) was so called not as bishop of Nazianzus. He
was bishop successively of Sasima, “a detestable little village,”—(Carm.
xi. 439–446)—and of Constantinople, and was called “Nazianzenus” because
his father and namesake was bishop of that see. On his acting as bishop
at Nazianzus after his withdrawal from Constantinople, vide note on page
136.
