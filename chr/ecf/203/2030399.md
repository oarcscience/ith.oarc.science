<span id="v.iii.xviii-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="v.iii.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVI.</span>

<span id="v.iii.xviii-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="v.iii.xviii-p2.1"></span>Ignatius</span>, <span
id="fr_2404"></span>[2405](#fn_2404) third bishop of the church of
Antioch after Peter the apostle, condemned to the wild beasts during the
persecution of Trajan, was sent bound to Rome, and when he had come on
his voyage as far as Smyrna, where Polycarp the pupil of John was
bishop, he wrote one epistle *To the Ephesians,* another *To the
Magnesians,* a third *To the Trallians,* a fourth *To the Romans,* and
going thence, he wrote *To the Philadelphians* and *To the Smyrneans*
and especially *To Polycarp,* commending to him the church at Antioch.
In this last <span id="fr_2405"></span>[2406](#fn_2405) he bore witness
to the Gospel which I have recently translated, in respect of the person
of Christ saying, “I indeed saw him in the flesh after the resurrection
and I believe that he is,” and when he came to Peter and those who were
with Peter, he said to them “Behold! touch me and see me how that I am
not an incorporeal spirit” and straightway they touched him and
believed. Moreover it seems worth while inasmuch as we have made mention
of such a man and of the *Epistle* which he wrote *to the Romans,* to
give a few “quotations” <span id="fr_2406"></span>[2407](#fn_2406) :
“From Syria even unto Rome I <span id="page_367">p. 367</span> <span
id="v.iii.xviii-Page_367"></span>fight with wild beasts, by land and by
sea, by night and by day, being bound amidst ten leopards, that is to
say soldiers who guard me and who only become worse when they are well
treated. Their wrong doing, however is my schoolmaster, but I am not
thereby justified. May I have joy of the beasts that are prepared for
me; and I pray that I may find them ready; I will even coax them to
devour me quickly that they may not treat me as they have some whom they
have refused to touch through fear. And if they are unwilling, I will
compel them to devour me. Forgive me my children, I know what is
expedient for me. Now do I begin to be a disciple, and desire none of
the things visible that I may attain unto Jesus Christ. Let fire and
cross and attacks of wild beasts, let wrenching of bones, cutting apart
of limbs, crushing of the whole body, tortures <span
id="fr_2407"></span>[2408](#fn_2407) of the devil,—let all these come
upon me if only I may attain unto the joy which is in Christ.”

<span id="v.iii.xviii-p7"></span>When he had been condemned to the wild
beasts and with zeal for martyrdom heard the lions roaring, he said “I
am the grain of Christ. I am ground by the teeth of the wild beasts that
I may be found the bread of the world.” He was put to death the eleventh
year of Trajan and the remains of his body lie in Antioch outside the
Daphnitic gate in the cemetery.
