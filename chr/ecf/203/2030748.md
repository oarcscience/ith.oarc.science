<span id="vi.xii.i.x-p1"></span> 9. Am I to say plainly what your
intention was, my most simple-minded friend? Do you think that we can
believe that you unwittingly gave the name of the martyr to the book of
a man who was a heretic, and thus made the ignorant, through their trust
in Christ’s witness, become the defenders of Origen? Considering the
erudition for which you are renowned, for which you are praised
throughout the West as an illustrious litterateur, <span
id="fr_3013"></span>[3014](#fn_3013.md) so that the men of your party all
speak of you as their Coryphæus, I will not suppose that you are
ignorant of Eusebius’ <span id="fr_3014"></span>[3015](#fn_3014.md)
Catalogue, which states the fact that the martyr Pamphilus never wrote a
single book. <span id="fr_3015"></span>[3016](#fn_3015.md) Eusebius
himself, the lover and companion of Pamphilus, and the herald of his
praises, wrote three books in elegant language containing the life of
Pamphilus. In these he extols other traits of his character with
extraordinary encomiums, and praises to the sky his humility; but on his
literary interests he writes as follows in the third book: “What lover
of books was there who did not find a friend in Pamphilus? If he knew of
any of them being in want of the necessaries of life, he helped them to
the full extent of his power. He would not only lend them copies of the
Holy Scriptures to read, but would give them most readily, and that not
only to men, but to women also if he saw that they were given to
reading. He therefore kept a store of manuscripts, so that he might be
able to give them to those who wished for them whenever occasion
demanded. He himself however, wrote nothing whatever of his own, except
private letters which he sent to his friends, so humble was his estimate
of himself. But the treatises of the old writers he studied with the
greatest diligence, and was constantly occupied in meditation upon
them.”

<span id="vi.xii.i.x-p4"></span> “The existence of a work which
consisted mainly of extracts from Origen with Comments, and of which he
was only the joint author, is quite reconcilable with this statement.
Indeed, the very form of the expression in the original, corresponding
to *‘ipse quidem’ ‘proprii’* was probably chosen so as to exclude this
work of compilation and partnership.” Lightfoot, Art. Eusebius of
Cæsarea, in Dict. of Christian Biography.

would be wise in Rufinus to give up this pretended defence.](2030749.md)
