church at Antioch, who had most successfully taught rhetoric in the same
city, held a discussion with Paul of Samosata, who as bishop of the
church at Antioch, had introduced the doctrine of Artemon, and this was
taken down by short hand writers. This dialogue is still extant, and yet
another extended epistle written by him, in behalf of the council, is
addressed to *Dionysius and Maximus,* bishops of Rome and Alexandria. He
flourished under Claudius and Aurelianus.
