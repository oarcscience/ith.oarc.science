<span id="iv.x.v-p1"></span> *V. Festal.*

<span id="iv.x.v-p2"></span>The God who made us gives us care and sorrow
after our sin. But He has furnished us with divine occasions of
consolation by appointing divine feasts. The thoughts they suggest both
remind us of God’s gifts to us, and promise complete freedom from all
our troubles. Enjoying these good things and filled with cheerfulness,
we address your magnificence, and, according to the custom of the
festival, pay friendship’s debt.
