<span id="iv.x.lx-p1"></span> *LX. To Dioscorus, Bishop of
Alexandria.* <span id="fr_1704"></span>[1705](#fn_1704.md)

<span id="iv.x.lx-p3"></span>Among many forms of virtue by which we hear
that your holiness is adorned (for all men’s ears are filled by the
flying fame of your glory, which speeds in all directions) special
praise is unanimously given to your modesty, a characteristic of which
our Lord in His law has given Himself as an ensample, saying, “Learn of
me; for I am meek and lowly in heart;” <span
id="fr_1705"></span>[1706](#fn_1705.md) for though God is high, or rather
most high He honoured at His incarnation the meek and lowly spirit.
Looking then to Him, sir, you do not behold the multitude of your
subjects nor the exaltation of your throne, but you see rather human
nature, and life’s rapid changes, and follow the divine laws whose
observance gives us the kingdom of heaven. Hearing of this modesty on
the part of your holiness, I take courage in a letter to salute a person
sacred and dear to God, and I offer prayers whereof the fruit is
salvation. Occasion is given me to write by the very pious presbyter
Eusebius, for when I heard of his journey thither I immediately indited
this letter to call upon your holiness to support us by your prayers,
and by your reply to give us a spiritual feast, sending to us who are
hungry the blessed banquet of your words.

letter is probably dated soon after.
