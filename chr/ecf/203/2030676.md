<span id="vi.xi.ii.xxxix-p1"></span> 36. I will address the Master in
one of his own phrases. <span id="fr_2882"></span>[2883](#fn_2882.md) Why,
after nearly four hundred years, do you give such teachings as these to
the Latin people with their peaceable and simple minds! Why do you
inflict on unaccustomed ears new-sounding words, which no one finds in
the writings of the Apostles? I beseech you, spare the ears of the
Romans, spare that faith which the Apostle praised. <span
id="fr_2883"></span>[2884](#fn_2883.md) Why do you bring out in public what
Peter and Paul were unwilling to publish? Did not the Christian world
exist without any of these things until—not as you say I made my
translations, but up to the time when you wrote what I have quoted, that
is till some fifteen years ago? For what is this teaching of yours, that
in the world to come there will still be risings and fallings,—that some
will go forward and some go back? If that be true, then what you say,
that in this world life is either acquired or lost, is not true; unless
it has some occult meaning. I do not find that you repent of any of
these doctrines which these commentaries contain. Again, you teach that
the Church is to be understood as being one body made up not of men only
but of angels and all the powers of heaven. You say in commenting on the
passage of the same book, in which the words occur <span
id="fr_2884"></span>[2885](#fn_2884.md) “And gave him to be head over all
the Church,” a little way down: “The Church may be understood as
consisting not of men alone, but also of angels, and of all the powers,
and <span id="page_455">p. 455</span> <span
id="vi.xi.ii.xxxix-Page_455"></span>reasonable creatures.” Again, you
say that souls, because in that former life they knew God, now know him
not as one previously unknown, but as though after having forgotten him
they came to recognize him again. These are the words used in a passage
of the same book:

<span id="vi.xi.ii.xxxix-p5"></span>“The words which he uses “In the
knowledge of him” <span id="fr_2885"></span>[2886](#fn_2885.md) some
interpret by recalling that between <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xi.ii.xxxix-p6.3"></span>γνωσις</span> and <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xi.ii.xxxix-p6.4"></span>᾽</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xi.ii.xxxix-p6.5"></span>επίγνωσις</span>
(Gnosis and Epignosis) that is, between knowing and recognition there is
this difference, that Knowing has reference to things which we did not
know before and have since begun to know, while Recognition has to do
with those things which we afterwards remember. Our souls, then, they
say, have a kind of apprehension of a former life, after they have been
cast down into human bodies, and have forgotten God their Father; but
now we know him by revelation, according to that which is written: <span
id="fr_2886"></span>[2887](#fn_2886.md) “All the ends of this world shall
remember and turn to the Lord;” and there are many similar passages.”
