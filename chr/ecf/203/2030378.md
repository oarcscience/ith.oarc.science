<span id="v.ii.iv-p1"></span> 4. *Editions*.

<span id="v.ii.iv-p2"></span>The editions of Jerome are relatively as
numerous as the <span class="c14"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p2.1"></span>mss.</span> The *Illustrious men* is included
in almost all the editions of his collected works, in his collected
“minor writ<span id="page_355">p. 355</span> <span
id="v.ii.iv-Page_355"></span>ings” and in many of the editions of his
epistles (most of the editions in fact from 1468 to about 1530.)

<span id="v.ii.iv-p3"></span>It is several times printed separately or
with Gennadius or other catalogues. The editions of Gennadius are less
numerous but he is often united with Jerome in the editions of Jerome’s
collected works, and generally in the separate editions.

<span id="v.ii.iv-p4"></span>The following list of editions is printed
as illustrative. It does not pretend to be complete, but is simply a
list of such as have been personally examined by the translator up to
date; s. l. et a (6) + 390 ff, 62, 11.; s. l. et a. (1468?) 223ff, 2

(Vallarsi); repr. 1766–72; Florence 1791; Paris 1865 (Migne); Lpz. 1879
(Herding) Turin 1875, 1877, 1885 (Jerome only).

<span id="v.ii.iv-p5"></span>Andreas, Erasmus, Victorinus, Graevius,
Martianay, Miraeus, Fabricius, Cyprian are among the earlier editors but
Erasmus is *facile princeps* in popularity of reprint. The edition of
Vallarsi in 1734–42 was a decided advance toward a critical text.
Various editors before him had made use of various <span
class="c14"><span id="v.ii.iv-p5.1"></span>mss.</span> especially the
“Corbeiensis” or “Sangermanensis” but secondarily <span
class="c14"><span id="v.ii.iv-p5.2"></span>mss.</span> at Wulfenbüttel,
Munich, the Bodleian, Nürnberg, “Sigbergensis,” “Gemblacensis,”
“Marcianus” and others. Vallarsi founded his edition largely on a Verona
<span class="c14"><span id="v.ii.iv-p5.3"></span>ms.</span> (still
there) on the “Corbeiensis” so much used and praised before (now Paris
Lat. 12161 “St. Crucis” one at Lucca of the 9th century and more or less
on <span class="c14"><span id="v.ii.iv-p5.4"></span>mss.</span> employed
by previous editors. This edition has remained the standard and is the
one adopted for the Migne edition.

<span id="v.ii.iv-p6"></span>The most recent edition which pretends to a
critical character is that of Herding (Lpz. 1879). The editions by
Tamietti are simply school editions of Jerome only, and make no
pretensions to a critical text. The edition of Herding is founded on a
transcript of Vat. Reg. 2077, 7th century; Bamberg 677, 11th century;
Bern, 11 cent. and a much mutilated Nürnberg <span class="c14"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p6.1"></span>ms.</span> of the 14th century. But it appears
that the transcript of Vaticanus only covered the Jerome and a few
scanty readings from Gennadius and the same is true of the collation
made for this editor later from the Paris <span class="c14"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p6.2"></span>ms.</span> (Corbeiensis).

<span id="v.ii.iv-p7"></span>Sittl, (Jahresber; u. class. Alterthumsw.
1888. 2 p. 243) says that the edition “without the preface which
contains a collation of Codex Corbeiensis would be worthless.” This is a
little strong, for the readings he gives from Vaticanus have a decided
value in default of other sources for its readings and his strict
following of this often produces a correct reading against Vallarsi who
was naturally inclined to follow Veronensis and Corbeiensis both of
which were probably a good deal manipulated after they left the hand of
Gennadius. The collation of Corbeiensis besides excluding Gennadius is
not over exact and some of the most effaced pages seem to have been
given up entirely by the collator.
