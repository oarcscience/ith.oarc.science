<span id="vi.xi.ii.x-p1"></span> 9. I have made answer more at length
than I had intended on this single article of the resurrection, through
fear lest by brevity I should lay myself open to fresh aspersions.
Consequently, I have made mention again and again not only of the body.
as to which cavils are raised, but of the flesh: and not only of the
flesh; I have added “this flesh;” and further I have spoken not only of
“this <span id="page_439">p. 439</span> <span
id="vi.xi.ii.x-Page_439"></span>flesh” but of “this natural flesh;” I
have not even stopped here, but have asserted that not even the
completeness of the several members would be lacking. I have only
demanded that it should be held as part of the faith that, according to
the words of the Apostle, it should rise incorruptible instead of
corruptible, glorious in stead of dishonoured, immortal instead of
frail, spiritual instead of natural; and that we should think of the
members of the spiritual body as being without taint of corruption or of
frailty. I have set forth my faith in reference to the Trinity, the
Incarnation of the Lord our Saviour, to his Passion and Resurrection,
his second coming and the judgment to come. I have also set it forth in
the matter of the resurrection of our flesh, and have left nothing, I
think, in ambiguity. Nothing in my opinion remains to be said, so far as
the faith is concerned.
