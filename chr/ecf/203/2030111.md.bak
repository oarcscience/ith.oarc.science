<span id="iv.viii.iv.v-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.iv.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V</span>.—*Of the reign of
Valentinianus, and how he associated Valens his brother with him.*

<span id="iv.viii.iv.v-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.iv.v-p2.1"></span>When</span> the troops had become
acquainted with the emperor’s sudden death, they wept for the departed
prince as for a father, and made Valentinian emperor in his room. It was
he who smote the officer of the temple <span
id="fr_675"></span>[676](#fn_675.md) and was sent to the castle. He was
distinguished not only for his courage, but also for prudence,
temperance, justice, and great stature. He was of so kingly and
magnanimous a character that, on an attempt being made by the army to
appoint a colleague to share his throne, he uttered the well-known words
which are universally repeated, “Before I was emperor, soldiers, it was
yours to give me the reins of empire: now that I have taken them, it is
mine, not yours, to take counsel for the state.” The troops were struck
with admiration at what he said, and contentedly followed the guidance
of his authority. Valentinian, however, sent for his brother from
Pannonia, and shared the empire with him. Would that he had never done
so! To Valens, <span id="fr_676"></span>[677](#fn_676.md) who had not yet
accepted unsound doctrines, was committed the charge of Asia and of
Egypt, while Valentinian allotted Europe to himself. He journeyed to the
Western provinces, and beginning with a proclamation of true religion,
instructed them in all righteousness. When the Arian Auxentius, bishop
of Milan, who was condemned in several councils, departed this
life, <span id="fr_677"></span>[678](#fn_677.md) the emperor summoned the
bishops and addressed them as follows: “Nurtured as you have been in
holy writ, you know full well what should be the character of one
dignified by the episcopate, and how he should rule his subjects aright,
not only with his lip, but with his life; exhibit himself as an example
of every kind of virtue, and make his conversation a witness of his
teaching. Seat now upon your archiepiscopal throne a man of such
character that we who rule the realm may honestly bow our heads before
him and welcome his reproofs,—for, in that we are men, it needs must be
that we sometimes stumble,—as a physician’s healing treatment.”

<span id="iv.viii.iv.v-p3"></span> Vide page 101. “Valentinian belongs
to the better class of Emperors. He was a soldier like Jovian, and held
the same rank at his election. He was a decided Christian like Jovian,
and, like him, free from the stain of persecution. Jovian’s rough good
humour was replaced in Valentinian by a violent and sometimes cruel
temper, but he had a sense of duty, and was free from Jovian’s vices.”

<span id="iv.viii.iv.v-p4"></span> “Valens was timid, suspicious, and
slow, yet not ungentle in private life. He was as uncultivated as his
brother, but not inferior to him in scrupulous care for his subjects. He
preferred remitting taxation to fighting at the head of the legions. In
both wars he is entitled to head the series of financial rather than
unwarlike sovereigns whose cautious policy brought the Eastern Empire
safely through the great barbarian invasions of the fifth century.”
