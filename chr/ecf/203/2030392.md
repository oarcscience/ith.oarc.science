<span id="v.iii.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="v.iii.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter IX.</span>

<span id="v.iii.xi-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="v.iii.xi-p2.1"></span>John</span>, <span
id="fr_2380"></span>[2381](#fn_2380.md) the apostle whom Jesus most loved,
the son of Zebedee and brother of James, the apostle whom Herod, after
our Lord’s passion, beheaded, most recently of all the evangelists wrote
a *Gospel,* at the request of the bishops of Asia, against Cerinthus and
other heretics and especially against the then growing dogma of the
Ebionites, who assert that Christ did not exist before Mary. On this
account he was compelled to maintain His divine nativity. But there is
said to be yet another reason for this work, in that when he had read
Matthew, Mark, and Luke, he approved indeed the substance of the history
and declared that the things they said were true, but that they had
given the history of only one year, the one, that is, which follows the
imprisonment of John and in which he was put to death. So passing by
this year the events of which had been set forth by these, he related
the events of the earlier period before John was shut up in prison, so
that it might be manifest to those who should diligently read the
volumes of the four Evangelists. This also takes away the discrepancy
which there seems to be between John and the others. He wrote also one
*Epistle* which begins as follows “That which was from the beginning,
that which we have heard, that which we have seen with our eyes and our
hands handled concerning the word of life” which is esteemed of by all
men who are interested in the church or in learning. The other two of
which the first is “The elder to the elect lady and her children” and
the other “The elder unto Gaius <span
id="fr_2381"></span>[2382](#fn_2381.md) the beloved whom I love in truth,”
are said to be the work of John the presbyter to the memory of whom
another sepulchre is shown at Ephesus to the present day, though some
think that there are two memorials of this same John the evangelist. We
shall treat of this matter in its turn <span
id="fr_2382"></span>[2383](#fn_2382.md) when we come to Papias his
disciple. In the fourteenth year then after Nero <span
id="fr_2383"></span>[2384](#fn_2383.md) Domitian having raised a second
persecution he was banished to the island of Patmos, and wrote the
*Apocalypse,* on which Justin Martyr and Irenæus afterwards wrote
commentaries. But Domitian having been put to death and his acts, on
account of his excessive cruelty, having been annulled by the senate, he
returned to Ephesus under <span id="page_365">p. 365</span> <span
id="v.iii.xi-Page_365"></span>Pertinax <span
id="fr_2384"></span>[2385](#fn_2384.md) and continuing there until the time
of the emperor Trajan, founded and built churches throughout all Asia,
and, worn out by old age, died in the sixty-eighth year after our Lord’s
passion and was buried near the same city.
