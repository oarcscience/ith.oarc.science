<span id="iv.x.xxiv-p1"></span> *XXIV. To Andreas Bishop of Samosata.*

<span id="iv.x.xxiv-p2"></span>Your piety, nursling of God’s love,
longs, I am sure, for my society. But I am all the more eager for yours
in proportion as I know that from it more advantage will accrue to me.
Want somehow naturally makes our wishes the stronger, but the Lord of
all is able to give us what we long for. He rules all things Himself;
knows what is sure to do us good, and never ceases to give every man
this boon. I really cannot tell you how much delighted I was with your
letter, and the very honourable and devout deacon Thalassius increased
my pleasure by telling me what I was very anxious to know, for what can
be more welcome to me than news that all goes well with you? And what is
it that so increases your welfare as the moderation of the great men
among us? You have acted like a wise and active physician who does not
wait to be sent for, but comes of his own accord to them that need his
care. This has given me great pleasure, and I have learnt by my own
experience what the poet means when he says “laughing through her
tears.” <span id="fr_1661"></span>[1662](#fn_1661.md) May the bountiful
Giver of all good things grant your holiness to excel in them, and to
make us emulous of what is praiseworthy in all good men. Help us then my
dear friend, and persuade him who can to grant our petition. <span
