<span id="III_1-p1"></span> <span id="III_1-p1.1"></span><span
class="c20"><span id="III_1-p1.2"></span>Psalm III. <span
id="fr_34"></span>[35](#fn_34.md) </span>

<span id="III_1-p3"></span>A psalm of David, when he fled from the face
of Abessalon his son.

<span id="III_1-p4"></span>1. The words, “I slept, and took rest; and
rose, for the Lord will take me up,” lead us to believe that this Psalm
is to be understood as in the Person of Christ; for they sound more
applicable to the Passion and Resurrection of our Lord, than to that
history in which David’s flight is described from the face of his
rebellious son. And, since it is written of Christ’s disciples, “The
sons of the bridegroom fast not as long as the bridegroom is with them;”
 <span id="fr_35"></span>[36](#fn_35.md) it is no wonder if by his
undutiful <span id="fr_36"></span>[37](#fn_36.md) son be here meant that
undutiful <span id="fr_37"></span>[38](#fn_37.md) disciple who betrayed
Him. From whose face although it may be understood historically that He
fled, when on his departure He withdrew with the rest to the mountain;
yet in a spiritual sense, when the Son of God, that is the Power and
Wisdom of God, abandoned the mind of Judas; when the Devil wholly
occupied him; as it is written, “The Devil entered into his
heart,” <span id="fr_38"></span>[39](#fn_38.md) may it be well understood
that Christ fled from his face; not that Christ gave place to the Devil,
but that on Christ’s departure the Devil took possession. Which
departure, I suppose, is called a flight in this Psalm, because of its
quickness; which is indicated also by the word of our Lord, saying,
“That thou doest, do quickly.” <span id="fr_39"></span>[40](#fn_39.md) So
even in common conversation we say of anything that does not come to
mind, it has fled from me; and of a man of much learning we say, nothing
flies from him. Wherefore truth fled from the mind of Judas, when it
ceased to enlighten him. But Absalom, as some interpret, in the Latin
tongue signifies, *Patris pax*, a father’s peace. And it may seem
strange, whether in the history of the kings, when Absalom carried on
war against his father; or in the history of the New Testament, when
Judas was the betrayer of our Lord; how “father’s peace” can be
understood. But both in the former place they who read carefully, see
that David in that war was at peace with his son, who even with sore
grief lamented his death, saying, “O Absalom, my son, would God I had
died for thee!” <span id="fr_40"></span>[41](#fn_40.md) And in the history
of the <span id="page_5">p. 5</span> <span id="III_1-Page_5"></span>New
Testament by that so great and so wonderful forbearance of our Lord; in
that He bore so long with him as if good, when He was not ignorant of
his thoughts; in that He admitted him to the Supper in which He
committed and delivered to His disciples the figure of His Body and
Blood; finally, in that He received the kiss of peace at the very time
of His betrayal; it is easily understood how Christ showed peace to His
betrayer, although he was laid waste by the intestine war of so
abominable a device. And therefore is Absalom called “father’s peace,”
because his father had the peace, which he had not.

<span id="III_1-p11"></span>2. “O Lord, how are they multiplied that
trouble me!” ([Psa. 3.1](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#001.md)<span
id="III_1-p11.1"></span>). So multiplied indeed were they, that one even
from the number of His disciples was not wanting, who was added to the
number of His persecutors. “Many rise up against me; many say unto my
soul, There is no salvation for him in his God” ([Psa.
3.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#002)<span id="III_1-p11.2"></span>.md). It
is clear that if they had had any idea that He would rise again,
assuredly they would not have slain Him. To this end are those speeches,
“Let Him come down from the cross, if He be the Son of God;” and again,
“He saved others, Himself He cannot save.” <span
id="fr_41"></span>[42](#fn_41.md) Therefore, neither would Judas have
betrayed Him, if he had not been of the number of those who despised
Christ, saying, “There is no salvation for Him in His God.”

<span id="III_1-p13"></span>3. “But Thou, O Lord, art my taker.” <span
id="fr_42"></span>[43](#fn_42.md) It is said to God in the nature of man,
for the taking of man is, the Word made Flesh. “My glory.” Even He calls
God his glory, whom the Word of God so took, that God became one with
Him. Let the proud learn, who unwillingly hear, when it is said to them,
“For what hast thou that thou didst not receive? Now if thou didst
receive it, why dost thou glory as if thou hadst not received it?” <span
id="fr_43"></span>[44](#fn_43.md) “And the lifter up of my head” ([Psa.
3.3](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#003)<span id="III_1-p15.2"></span>.md). I
think that this should be here taken of the human mind, which is not
unreasonably called the head of the soul; <span
id="fr_44"></span>[45](#fn_44.md) which so inhered in, and in a sort
coalesced with, the supereminent excellency of the Word taking man, that
it was not laid aside by so great humiliation of the Passion.

<span id="III_1-p17"></span>4. “With my voice have I cried unto the
Lord” ([Psa. 3.4](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#004.md)<span
id="III_1-p17.1"></span>); that is, not with the voice of the body,
which is drawn out with the sound of the reverberation of the air; but
with the voice of the heart, which to men speaks not, but with God
sounds as a cry. By this voice Susanna was heard; <span
id="fr_45"></span>[46](#fn_45.md) and with this voice the Lord Himself
commanded that prayer should be made in closets, <span
id="fr_46"></span>[47](#fn_46.md) that is, in the recesses of the heart
noiselessly. Nor would one easily say that prayer is not made with this
voice, if no sound of words is uttered from the body; since even when in
silence we pray within the heart, if thoughts interpose alien from the
mind of one praying, it cannot yet be said, “With my voice have I cried
unto the Lord.” Nor is this rightly said, save when the soul alone,
taking to itself nothing of the flesh, and nothing of the aims of the
flesh, in prayer, speaks to God, where He only hears. But even this is
called a cry by reason of the strength of its intention. “And He heard
me out of His holy mountain.” We have the Lord Himself called a mountain
by the Prophet, as it is written, “The stone that was cut out without
hands grew to the size of a mountain.” <span
id="fr_47"></span>[48](#fn_47.md) But this cannot be taken of His Person,
unless peradventure He would speak thus, out of myself, as of His holy
mountain He heard me, when He dwelt in me, that is, in this very
mountain. But it is more plain and unembarrassed, if we understand that
God out of His justice heard. For it was just that He should raise again
from the dead the Innocent who was slain, and to whom evil had been
recompensed for good, and that He should render to the persecutor a meet
reward, who repaid Him evil for good. For we read, “Thy justice is as
the mountains of God.” <span id="fr_48"></span>[49](#fn_48.md)

<span id="III_1-p22"></span>5. “I slept, and took rest” <span
id="fr_49"></span>[50](#fn_49.md) ([Psa.
3.5](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#005)<span id="III_1-p23.1"></span>.md). It
may be not unsuitably remarked, that it is expressly said, “I,” to
signify that of His own Will He underwent death, according to that,
“Therefore doth My Father love Me, because I lay down My life, that I
might take it again. No man taketh it from Me; I have power to lay it
down, and I have power to take it again.” <span
id="fr_50"></span>[51](#fn_50.md) Therefore, saith He, you have not taken
Me as though against My will, and slain Me; but “I slept, and took rest;
and rose, for the Lord will take me up.” Scripture contains numberless
instances of sleep being put for death; as the Apostle says, “I would
not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are
asleep.” <span id="fr_51"></span>[52](#fn_51.md) Nor need we make any
question why it is added, “took rest,” seeing that it has already been
said, “I slept.” Repetitions of this kind are usual in Scripture, as we
have pointed out many in the second Psalm. But some copies have, “I
slept, and was cast into a deep sleep.” <span
id="fr_52"></span>[53](#fn_52.md) And different copies express it
differently, according to the possible renderings of the Greek words,
<span class="Greek"><span id="III_1-p26.1"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="III_1-p26.2"></span>γὼ δš ἐκοιμήθην καὶ
ὕπνωσα</span>. Unless perhaps sleeping <span
id="fr_53"></span>[54](#fn_53.md) may be taken of one dying, but <span
id="page_6">p. 6</span> <span id="III_1-Page_6"></span>sleep <span
id="fr_54"></span>[55](#fn_54.md) of one dead: so that sleeping may be the
transition into sleep, as awakening is the transition into wakefulness.
Let us not deem these repetitions in the sacred writings empty ornaments
of speech. “I slept, and took rest,” is therefore well understood as “I
gave Myself up to My Passion, and death ensued.” “And I rose, for the
Lord will take Me up.” <span id="fr_55"></span>[56](#fn_55.md) This is the
more to be remarked, how that in one sentence the Psalmist has used a
verb of past and future time. For he has said, both “I rose,” which is
the past, and “will take Me up,” which is the future; seeing that
assuredly the rising again could not be without that taking up. But in
prophecy the future is well joined to the past, whereby both are
signified. Since things which are prophesied of as yet to come in
reference to time are future; but in reference to the knowledge of those
who prophesy they are already to be viewed as done. Verbs of the present
tense are also mixed in, which shall be treated of in their proper place
when they occur.

<span id="III_1-p30"></span>6. “I will not fear the thousands of people
that surround me” ([Psa. 3.6](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#006.md)<span
id="III_1-p30.1"></span>). It is written in the Gospels how great a
multitude stood around Him as He was suffering, and on the cross.
“Arise, O Lord, save me, O my God” ([Psa.
3.7](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#007)<span id="III_1-p30.2"></span>.md). It
is not said to God, “Arise,” as if asleep or lying down, but it is usual
in holy Scripture to attribute to God what He doeth in us; not indeed
universally, but where it can be done suitably; as when He is said to
speak, when by His gift Prophets speak, and Apostles, or whatsoever
messengers of the truth. Hence that text, “Would you have proof of
Christ, who speaketh in me?” <span id="fr_56"></span>[57](#fn_56.md) For he
doth not say, of Christ, by whose enlightening or order I speak; but he
attributes at once the speaking itself to Him, by whose gift he spake.

<span id="III_1-p32"></span>7. “Since Thou hast smitten all who oppose
me without a cause.” It is not to be pointed as if it were one sentence,
“Arise, O Lord, save me, O my God; since Thou hast smitten all who
oppose me without a cause.” For He did not therefore save Him, because
He smote His enemies; but rather He being saved, He smote them.
Therefore it belongs to what follows, so that the sense is this; “Since
Thou hast smitten all who oppose me without a cause, Thou hast broken
the teeth of the sinners;” that is, thereby hast Thou broken the teeth
of the sinners, since Thou hast smitten all who oppose me. It is
forsooth the punishment of the opposers, whereby their teeth have been
broken, that is, the words of sinners rending with their cursing the Son
of God, brought to nought, as it were to dust; so that we may understand
“teeth” thus, as words of cursing. Of <span
id="fr_57"></span>[58](#fn_57.md) which teeth the Apostle speaks, “If ye
bite one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of
another.” <span id="fr_58"></span>[59](#fn_58.md) The teeth of sinners can
also be taken as the chiefs of sinners; by whose authority each one is
cut off from the fellowship of godly livers, and as it were incorporated
with evil livers. To these teeth are opposed the Church’s teeth, by
whose authority believers are cut off from the error of the Gentiles and
divers opinions, and are translated into that fellowship which is the
body of Christ. With these teeth Peter was told to eat the animals when
they had been killed, that is, by killing in the Gentiles what they
were, and changing them into what he was himself. Of these teeth too of
the Church it is said, “Thy teeth are as a flock of shorn sheep, coming
up from the bath, whereof every one beareth twins, and there is not one
barren among them.” <span id="fr_59"></span>[60](#fn_59.md) These are they
who prescribe rightly, and as they prescribe, live; who do what is
written, “Let your works shine before men, that they may bless your
Father which is in heaven.” <span id="fr_60"></span>[61](#fn_60.md) For
moved by their authority, they believe God who speaketh and worketh
through these men; and separated from the world, to which they were once
conformed, they pass over into the members of the Church. And rightly
therefore are they, through whom such things are done, called teeth like
to shorn sheep; for they have laid aside the burdens of earthly cares,
and coming up from the bath, from the washing away of the filth of the
world by the Sacrament of Baptism, every one beareth twins. For they
fulfil the two commandments, of which it is said, “On these two
commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets;” <span
id="fr_61"></span>[62](#fn_61.md) loving God with all their heart, and with
all their soul, and with all their mind, and their neighbour as
themselves. “There is not one barren among them,” for much fruit they
render unto God. According to this sense then it is to be thus
understood, “Thou hast broken the teeth of the sinners,” that is, Thou
hast brought the chiefs of the sinners to nought, by smiting all who
oppose Me without a cause. For the chiefs according to the Gospel
history persecuted Him, whilst the lower people honoured Him.

<span id="III_1-p38"></span>8. “Salvation is of the Lord; and upon Thy
people be Thy blessing” ([Psa.
3.8](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#008)<span id="III_1-p38.1"></span>.md). In
one sentence the Psalmist has enjoined men what to believe, and has
prayed for believers. For when it is said, “Salvation is of the Lord,”
the words are addressed to men. Nor does it follow, “And upon Thy
people” be “Thy blessing,” in such wise as that the whole is spoken to
men, but there is a change into prayer addressed to God Himself, for the
very people to whom it <span id="page_7">p. 7</span> <span
id="III_1-Page_7"></span>was said, “Salvation is of the Lord.” What else
then doth he say but this? Let no man presume on himself, seeing that it
is of the Lord to save from the death of sin; for, “Wretched man that I
am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death? The grace of God
through Jesus Christ our Lord.” <span id="fr_62"></span>[63](#fn_62.md) But
do Thou, O Lord, bless Thy people, who look for salvation from Thee.

<span id="III_1-p40"></span>9. This Psalm can be taken as in the Person
of Christ another way; which is that whole Christ should speak. <span
id="fr_63"></span>[64](#fn_63.md) I mean by whole, with His body, of which
He is the Head, according to the Apostle, who says, “Ye are the body of
Christ, and the members.” <span id="fr_64"></span>[65](#fn_64.md) He
therefore is the Head of this body; wherefore in another place he saith,
“But doing the truth in love, we may increase in Him in all things, who
is the Head, Christ, from whom the whole body is joined together and
compacted.” <span id="fr_65"></span>[66](#fn_65.md) In the Prophet then at
once, the Church, and her Head (the Church founded amidst the storms of
persecution throughout the whole world, which we know already to have
come to pass), speaks, “O Lord, how are they multiplied that trouble me!
many rise up against me;” wishing to exterminate the Christian name.
“Many say unto my soul, There is no salvation for him in his God.” For
they would not otherwise hope that they could destroy the Church,
branching out so very far and wide, unless they believed that God had no
care thereof. “But Thou, O Lord, art my taker;” in Christ of course. For
into that flesh <span id="fr_66"></span>[67](#fn_66.md) the Church too hath
been taken by the Word, “who was made flesh, and dwelt in us;” <span
id="fr_67"></span>[68](#fn_67.md) for that “In heavenly places hath He made
us to sit together with Him.” <span id="fr_68"></span>[69](#fn_68.md) When
the Head goes before, the other members will follow; for, “Who shall
separate us from the love of Christ?” <span
id="fr_69"></span>[70](#fn_69.md) Justly then does the Church say, “Thou
art my taker. My glory;” for she doth not attribute her excellency to
herself, seeing that she knoweth by whose grace and mercy she is what
she is. “And the lifter up of my head,” of Him, namely, who, “the
First-born from the dead,” <span id="fr_70"></span>[71](#fn_70.md) ascended
up into heaven. “With my voice have I cried unto the Lord, and He heard
me out of His holy mountain.” This is the prayer of all the Saints, the
odour of sweetness, which ascends up in the sight of the Lord. For now
the Church is heard out of this mountain, which is also her head; or,
out of that justice of God, by which both His elect are set free, and
their persecutors punished. Let the people of God also say, “I slept,
and took rest; and rose, for the Lord will take me up;” that they may be
joined, and cleave to their Head. <span id="fr_71"></span>[72](#fn_71.md)
For to this people is it said, “Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from
the dead, and Christ shall lay hold on thee.” <span
id="fr_72"></span>[73](#fn_72.md) Since they are taken out of sinners, of
whom it is said generally, “But they that sleep, sleep in the
night.” <span id="fr_73"></span>[74](#fn_73.md) Let them say moreover, “I
will not fear the thousands of people that surround me;” of the heathen
verily that compass me about to extinguish everywhere, if they could,
the Christian name. But how should they be feared, when by the blood of
the martyrs in Christ, as by oil, the ardour of love is inflamed?
“Arise, O Lord, save me, O my God.” The body can address this to its own
Head. For at His rising the body was saved; who “ascended up on high,
led captivity captive, gave gifts unto men.” <span
id="fr_74"></span>[75](#fn_74.md) For this is said by the Prophet, in the
secret purpose of God, <span id="fr_75"></span>[76](#fn_75.md) until that
ripe harvest <span id="fr_76"></span>[77](#fn_76.md) which is spoken of in
the Gospel, whose salvation is in His Resurrection, who vouchsafed to
die for us, shed out our Lord to the earth. “Since Thou hast smitten all
who oppose me without a cause, Thou hast broken the teeth of the
sinners.” Now while the Church hath rule, the enemies of the Christian
name are smitten with confusion; and, whether their curses or their
chiefs, brought to nought. Believe then, O man, that “salvation is of
the Lord: and,” Thou, O Lord, may “Thy blessing” be “upon Thy people.”

<span id="III_1-p55"></span>10. Each one too of us may say, when a
multitude of vices and lusts leads the resisting mind in the law of sin,
“O Lord, how are they multiplied that trouble me! many rise up against
me.” And, since despair of recovery generally creeps in through the
accumulation of vices, as though these same vices were mocking the soul,
or even as though the Devil and his angels through their poisonous
suggestions were at work to make us despair, it is said with great
truth, “Many say unto my soul, There is no salvation for him in his God.
But Thou, O Lord, art my taker.” For this is our hope, that He hath
vouchsafed to take the nature of man in Christ. “My glory;” according to
that rule, that no one should ascribe ought to himself. “And the lifter
up of my head;” either of Him, who is the Head of us all, or of the
spirit of each several one of us, which is the head of the soul and
body. For “the head of the woman is the man, and the head of the man is
Christ.” <span id="fr_77"></span>[78](#fn_77.md) But the mind is lifted up,
when it can be said already, “With the mind I serve the law of
God;” <span id="fr_78"></span>[79](#fn_78.md) that the rest of man may be
reduced to peaceable submission, when in the resurrection of the flesh
<span id="page_8">p. 8</span> <span id="III_1-Page_8"></span>“death is
swallowed up in victory.” <span id="fr_79"></span>[80](#fn_79.md) “With my
voice I have cried unto the Lord;” with that most inward and intensive
voice. “And He heard me out of His holy mountain;” <span
id="fr_80"></span>[81](#fn_80.md) Him, through whom He hath succoured us,
through whose mediation He heareth us. “I slept, and took rest; and
rose, for the Lord will take me up.” Who of the faithful is not able to
say this, when he calls to mind the death of his sins, and the gift of
regeneration? “I will not fear the thousands of people that surround
me.” Besides those which the Church universally hath borne and beareth,
each one also hath temptations, by which, when compassed about, he may
speak these words, “Arise, O Lord; save me, O my God:” that is, make me
to arise. “Since Thou hast smitten all who oppose me without a cause:”
it is well in God’s determinate <span id="fr_81"></span>[82](#fn_81.md)
purpose said of the Devil and his angels; who rage not only against the
whole body of Christ, but also against each one in particular. “Thou
hast broken the teeth of the sinners.” Each man hath those that revile
him, he hath too the prime authors of vice, who strive to cut him off
from the body of Christ. But “salvation is of the Lord.” Pride is to be
guarded against, and we must say, “My soul cleaved after Thee.” <span
id="fr_82"></span>[83](#fn_82.md) “And upon Thy people” be “Thy blessing:”
that is, upon each one of us.
