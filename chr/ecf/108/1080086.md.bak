<span id="ii.LXXV-p1"></span> <span id="ii.LXXV-p1.1"></span><span
class="c20"><span id="ii.LXXV-p1.2"></span>Psalm LXXV. <span
id="fr_3390"></span>[3391](#fn_3390.md) </span>

<span id="ii.LXXV-p3"></span>1. …The Title of this Psalm thus speaketh:
“At the end, <span id="fr_3391"></span>[3392](#fn_3391.md) corrupt not.”
What is, “corrupt not?” That which Thou hast promised, perform. But
when? “At the end.” To this then let the mind’s eye be directed, “unto
the end.” Let all the things which have occurred in the way be passed
over, in order that we may attain to the end. Let proud men exult
because of present felicity, let them swell with honours, glitter in
gold, overflow with domestics, be encircled with the services of
clients: these things pass away, they pass away like a shadow. When that
end shall have come, when all who now hope in the Lord are to rejoice,
then to them shall come sorrow without end. When the meek shall have
received that which the proud deride, then the vapouring of the proud
shall be turned into mourning. Then shall there be that voice which we
know in the Book of Wisdom: for they shall say at that time when they
see the glory of the Saints, who, when they were in humiliation, endured
them; who, when they were exalted, consented not—at that time then they
shall say, “These are they whom sometime we have had in derision.” <span
id="fr_3392"></span>[3393](#fn_3392.md) Where they also say, “What hath
pride profited us, and the boasting of riches hath bestowed upon us
what?” All things have passed away like a shadow. Because on things
corruptible they relied, their hope shall be corrupted: but our own hope
at that time shall be substance. For in order that the promise of God
may remain whole and sure and certain towards us, we have said out of a
heart <span id="fr_3393"></span>[3394](#fn_3393.md) of faith, “at the end
corrupt not.” Fear not, therefore, lest any mighty man should corrupt
the promises of God. He doth not corrupt, because He is truthful; He
hath no one more mighty by whom His promise may be corrupted: let us be
then sure concerning the promises of God; and let us sing now from the
place where the Psalm beginneth.

<span id="ii.LXXV-p7"></span>2. “We will confess to Thee, O Lord, we
will confess to Thee, and will invoke Thy name” ([Psa.
75.1](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#001)<span id="ii.LXXV-p7.1"></span>.md).
Do not invoke, before thou confess: confess, and invoke. For Him whom
thou art invoking, unto thyself thou callest. For what is it to invoke,
but unto thyself to call? If He is invoked by thee, that is, if He is
called to thee, unto whom doth He draw near? To a proud man He draweth
not near. High indeed He is, one lifted up attaineth not unto Him. In
order that we may reach all exalted objects, we raise ourselves, and if
we are not able to reach them, we look for some appliances or ladders,
in order that being exalted we may reach exalted objects: contrariwise
God is both high, and by the lowly He is reached. It is written, “Nigh
is the Lord to them that have bruised the heart.” <span
id="fr_3394"></span>[3395](#fn_3394.md) The bruising of the heart is
Godliness, humility. He that bruiseth himself is angry with himself. Let
him make himself angry in order that he may make Him merciful; let him
make himself judge, in order that he may make Him Advocate. Therefore
God doth come when invoked. Unto whom doth He come? To the proud man He
cometh not.…Take heed therefore what ye do: for if He knoweth, He is not
unobservant. <span id="fr_3395"></span>[3396](#fn_3395.md) It is better
therefore that He be unobservant than known. For what is that same being
unobservant, but not knowing? What is, not to know? Not to animadvert.
For even as the act of one avenging animadversion is wont to be spoken
of. Here one praying that He be unobservant: “Turn away Thy face from my
sins.” <span id="fr_3396"></span>[3397](#fn_3396.md) What then wilt thou do
if He shall have turned away His face from thee? A grievous thing it is,
and to be feared, lest He forsake thee. Again, if He turn not away His
face, He animadverteth. God knoweth this thing, God can do this thing,
namely, both turn away face from one sinning, and not turn away from one
confessing.…Confess therefore and invoke. For by confessing thou purgest
the Temple, into which He may <span id="page_351">p. 351</span> <span
id="ii.LXXV-Page_351"></span>come, when invoked. Confess and invoke. May
He turn away face from thy sins, not turn away from thee: turn away face
from that which thou hast wrought, <span
id="fr_3397"></span>[3398](#fn_3397.md) not turn away from that which He
hath Himself wrought. <span id="fr_3398"></span>[3399](#fn_3398.md) For
thee, as man, He hath Himself wrought, thy sins thou hast thyself
wrought.…

<span id="ii.LXXV-p13"></span>3. But that there is a strengthening of
the sense in repetition, by many passages of the Scriptures we are
taught. Thence is that which the Lord saith, “Verily, Verily.” <span
id="fr_3399"></span>[3400](#fn_3399.md) Thence in certain Psalms is, “So be
it, So be it.” <span id="fr_3400"></span>[3401](#fn_3400.md) To signify the
thing, one “So be it” would have been sufficient: to signify
confirmation, there hath been added another “So be it.”…Countless
passages of such sort there are throughout all the Scriptures. With
these it is sufficient that we have commended to your notice a way of
speaking which ye may observe in all like cases: now to the substance
attend: “We will confess to Thee,” he saith, “and we will invoke.” I
have said why before invocation confession doth precede: because whom
thou dost invoke, him thou dost invite. But he willeth not to come when
invoked, if thou shalt have been lifted up: lifted up if thou shalt have
been, thou wilt not be able to confess. And thou deniest not any things
to God that He knoweth not. Therefore thy confession doth not teach Him,
but it purgeth thee.

<span id="ii.LXXV-p16"></span>4. …Hear ye now the words of Christ. For
these seemed not as it were to be His words, <span
id="fr_3401"></span>[3402](#fn_3401.md) “We will confess to Thee, O God, we
will confess to Thee, and will invoke Thy name.” Now beginneth the
discourse in the person of the Head. But whether Head speaketh or
whether members speak, Christ speaketh: He speaketh in the person of the
Head, He speaketh in the person of the Body. But what hath been said?
There shall be two in one flesh. <span
id="fr_3402"></span>[3403](#fn_3402.md) “This is a great Sacrament:” “I,”
he saith, “speak in Christ and in the Church.” <span
id="fr_3403"></span>[3404](#fn_3403.md) And He Himself in the Gospel,
“Therefore no longer two, but one flesh.” <span
id="fr_3404"></span>[3405](#fn_3404.md) For in order that ye may know these
in a manner to be two persons, and again one by the bond of marriage, as
one He speaketh in Isaiah, and saith, “As upon a Bridegroom he hath
bound upon me a mitre, and as a Bride he hath clothed me with an
ornament.” <span id="fr_3405"></span>[3406](#fn_3405.md) A Bridegroom He
hath called Himself in the Head, a Bride in the Body. He is speaking
therefore as One, let us hear Him, and in Him let us also speak. Let us
be the members of Him, in order that this voice may possibly be ours
also. “I will tell forth,” he saith, “all Thy marvellous things.” Christ
is preaching Himself, He is preaching Himself even in His members now
existing, in order that He may guide unto Him others, and they may draw
near that were not, and may be united with those members of Him, through
which members of Him the Gospel hath been preached; and there may be
made one Body under one Head, in one Spirit, in one Life.

<span id="ii.LXXV-p22"></span>5. And he saith what? “When I shall have
received,” he saith, “the time, <span
id="fr_3406"></span>[3407](#fn_3406.md) I will judge justices” ([Psa.
75.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#002)<span id="ii.LXXV-p23.1"></span>.md).
When shall He judge justices? When He shall have received the time. Not
yet is the precise time. Thanks to His mercy: He first preacheth
justices, and then He judgeth justices. For if He willed to judge before
He willed to preach, who would be found that should be delivered: who
would meet Him that should be absolved? Now therefore is the time of
preaching: “I will tell,” he saith, “all Thy marvellous works.” Hear Him
telling, hear Him preaching: for if thou shalt have despised Him, “when
I shall have received the time,” He saith, “I will judge justices.” I
forgive, He saith, now sins to one confessing, I will not spare
hereafter one despising.…He hath received a time as Son of Man; He doth
govern times as Son of God. Hear how as Son of Man He hath received the
time of judging. He saith in the Gospel, “He hath given to Him power to
execute judgment, because Son of Man He is.”  <span
id="fr_3407"></span>[3408](#fn_3407.md) According to His nature as Son of
God, He hath never received power of judging, because He never lacked
the power of judging: according to His nature as Son of Man He hath
received a time, as of being born, and of suffering, as of dying, and of
rising again, and of ascending, so of coming and of judging. In Him His
Body also saith these words, for not without them He will judge. For He
saith in the Gospel, “Ye shall sit upon twelve thrones judging the
twelve tribes of Israel.” <span id="fr_3408"></span>[3409](#fn_3408.md)
Therefore whole Christ saith, that is, Head and Body in the Saints,
“when I shall have received the time, I will judge justices.”

<span id="ii.LXXV-p26"></span>6. But now what? “The earth hath flowed
down” ([Psa. 75.3](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#003.md)<span
id="ii.LXXV-p26.1"></span>). If the earth hath flowed down, whence hath
it flowed down except by sins? Therefore also they are called
delinquencies. To delinquish is as it were by a kind of liquidity <span
id="fr_3409"></span>[3410](#fn_3409.md) to slip down from the stability of
firmness in virtue and righteousness. For it is through desire of lower
things that every man sinneth: as he is strengthened by the love of
higher things, so he falleth down and as it were melteth away by desire
of lower things. This flux of things by the sins of man the merciful
forgiver observing, being a merciful forgiver of <span id="page_352">p.
352</span> <span id="ii.LXXV-Page_352"></span>sins, not yet an exactor
of punishments, He observeth and saith: The earth herself indeed hath
flowed down by them that dwell in her. That which followeth is an
exposition, not an addition. As though thou wert saying, in what manner
hath the earth flowed down? Have the foundations been withdrawn, and
hath anything therein been swallowed up in a sort of gulf? What I mean
by earth is all they that dwell therein. I have found, he saith, the
earth sinful. And I have done what? “I have strengthened the pillars
thereof.” What are the pillars which He hath strengthened? Pillars He
hath called the Apostles. So the Apostle Paul concerning his
fellow-Apostles saith, “who seemed to be pillars.” <span
id="fr_3410"></span>[3411](#fn_3410.md) And what would those pillars have
been, except by Him they had been strengthened? For on occasion of a
sort of earthquake even these very pillars rocked: at the Passion of the
Lord all the Apostles despaired. Therefore those pillars which rocked at
the Passion of the Lord, by the Resurrection were strengthened. The
Beginning of the building hath cried out through the pillars thereof,
and in all those pillars the Architect Himself hath cried out. For the
Apostle Paul was one pillar of them when he said, “Would ye receive a
proof of Him that speaketh in me—Christ?” <span
id="fr_3411"></span>[3412](#fn_3411.md) Therefore, “I,” he saith, “have
strengthened the pillars thereof:” I have risen again, I have shown that
death is not to be feared, I have shown to them that fear, that not even
the body itself doth perish in the dying. There terrified them wounds,
there strengthened them scars. The Lord Jesus could have risen again
without any scar: for what great matter were it for that power, to
restore the frame of the body to such perfect soundness, as that no
trace at all of past wound should appear? He had power whence He might
make it whole even without scar: but He willed to have that whereby He
might strengthen the rocking pillars.

<span id="ii.LXXV-p30"></span>7. We have heard now, brethren, that which
day by day is not kept secret: let us hear now what He hath cried
through these pillars.…He crieth what? “I have said to unjust men, Do
not unjustly” ([Psa. 75.4](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#004.md)<span
id="ii.LXXV-p30.1"></span>).…But already they have done, and they are
guilty: already there hath flowed down the earth, and all they that
dwell therein. Pricked to the heart were they that crucified
Christ, <span id="fr_3412"></span>[3413](#fn_3412.md) they acknowledged
their sin, they learned something of the Apostle, that they might not
despair of the pardon of the Preacher. <span
id="fr_3413"></span>[3414](#fn_3413.md) For as Physician He had come, and
therefore had not come to the whole. “For there is no need,” He saith,
“to the whole of a physician, but to them that are sick. I have not come
to call righteous men, but sinners to repentance.” <span
id="fr_3414"></span>[3415](#fn_3414.md) Therefore, “I have said to unjust
men, Do not unjustly.” They heard not. For of old to us it was spoken:
we heard not, we fell, were made mortal, were begotten mortal: the earth
flowed down. Let them hear the Physician even now in order that they may
rise, Him that came to the sick man, Him whom they would not hear when
whole in order that they might not fall, let them hear when lying down
in order that they may rise.…“I have said to unjust men, Do not
unjustly; and to the delinquent, Do not exalt your horn.” There shall be
exalted in you the horn of Christ, if your horn be not exalted. Your
horn is of iniquity, the horn of Christ is of majesty.

<span id="ii.LXXV-p34"></span>8. “Be not therefore lifted up: speak not
iniquity against God” ([Psa. 75.5](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#005.md)<span
id="ii.LXXV-p34.1"></span>).…What saith He in another Psalm? “These
things thou hast done,” having enumerated certain sins. “These things
thou hast done,” He saith, “and was silent.” <span
id="fr_3415"></span>[3416](#fn_3415.md) What is, “I was silent”? He is
never silent with commandment, but meanwhile He is silent with
punishment: He is keeping still from vengeance, He doth not pronounce
sentence against the condemned. But this man saith thus, I have done
such and such things, and God hath not taken vengeance; behold I am
whole, nought of ill hath befallen me. “These things thou hast done, and
I was silent: thou hast suspected iniquity, that I shall be like unto
thee.” What is, “that I shall be like unto thee”? Because thou art
unjust, even Me thou hast deemed unjust; as though an approver of thy
misdeeds, and no adversary, no avenger thereof. And what afterwards
saith He to thee? “I will convict thee, and will set thee before thine
own face”? <span id="fr_3416"></span>[3417](#fn_3416.md) What is this?
Because now by sinning behind thy back thou settest thyself, seest not
thyself, examinest not thyself; I will set thee before thyself, and will
bring upon thee punishment from thyself. So also here, “Speak not
iniquity against God.” Attend. Many men speak this iniquity; but dare
not openly, lest as blasphemers they be abhorred by godly men: in their
heart they gnaw upon these things, within they feed upon such impious
food; it delighteth them to speak against God, and if they break not out
with tongue, in heart they are not silent. Whence in another Psalm is
said, “The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God.” <span
id="fr_3417"></span>[3418](#fn_3417.md) The fool hath said, but he hath
feared men: he would not say it where men might hear; and he said it in
that place where He might Himself hear concerning whom he said it.
Therefore here also in this Psalm (dearly beloved attend), whereas that
which He said, “Do not speak iniquity against <span id="page_353">p.
353</span> <span id="ii.LXXV-Page_353"></span>God,” this He saw many men
do in heart, He hath also added, “for neither from East, nor from West,
nor from the deserts of the mountains ([Psa.
75.6](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#006)<span id="ii.LXXV-p37.2"></span>.md),
for God is Judge” ([Psa. 75.7](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#007.md)<span
id="ii.LXXV-p37.3"></span>). Of thine iniquities God is Judge. If God He
is, everywhere He is present. Whither wilt thou take thyself away from
the eyes of God, so that in some quarter thou mayest speak that which He
may not hear? If from the East God judgeth, withdraw into the West, and
say what thou wilt against God: if from the West, go into the East, and
there speak: if from the deserts of the mountains He judgeth, go into
the midst of the peoples, where thou mayest murmur to thyself. From no
place judgeth He that everywhere is secret, everywhere open; whom it is
allowed no one to know as He is, and whom no one is permitted not to
know. Take heed what thou doest. Thou art speaking iniquity against God.
“The Spirit of the Lord hath filled the round world” (another Scripture
saith this), “and that which containeth all things hath knowledge of the
voice: wherefore he that speaketh unjust things cannot be hid.” <span
id="fr_3418"></span>[3419](#fn_3418.md) Do not therefore think God to be in
places: He is with thee such an one as thou shalt have been. What is
such an one as thou shalt have been? Good, if thou shalt have been good;
and evil to thee He will seem, if evil thou shalt have been; but a
Helper, if good thou shalt have been; an Avenger, if evil thou shalt
have been. There thou hast a Judge in thy secret place. Willing to do
something of evil, from the public thou retirest into thy house, where
no enemy may see; from those places of thine house which are open and
before the eyes of men, thou removest thyself into a chamber; thou
fearest even in thy chamber some witness from some other quarter, thou
retirest into thy heart, there thou meditatest: He is more inward than
thy heart. Whithersoever therefore thou shalt have fled, there He is.
From thyself whither wilt thou flee? Wilt thou not follow thyself
whithersoever thou shalt flee? But since there is One more inward even
than thyself, there is no place whither thou mayest flee from God angry,
but to God reconciled. There is no place at all whither thou mayest
flee. Wilt thou flee from Him? Flee to Him.…What then shall we do now?
“Let us come before His face,” <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.LXXV-p38.2"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.LXXV-p38.3"></span>ν ἐξομολογήσει</span>, come before in
confession: He shall come gentle whom thou hadst made angry. “Neither
from the deserts of the mountains, for God is Judge:” not from the East,
not from the West, not from the deserts of the mountains. Wherefore?
“For God is Judge.” If in any place He were, He would not be God: but
because God is Judge, not man, do not expect Him out of places. His
place thou wilt be, if thou art good, if after having confessed <span
id="fr_3419"></span>[3420](#fn_3419.md) thou shalt have invoked Him.

<span id="ii.LXXV-p40"></span>9. “One He humbleth, and another He
exalteth” ([Psa. 75.7](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#007.md)<span
id="ii.LXXV-p40.1"></span>). Whom humbleth, whom exalteth this Judge?
Observe these two men in the temple, and ye see whom He humbleth and
whom He exalteth. “They went up into the Temple to pray,” He saith, “the
one a Pharisee, and the other a Publican.…“Verily I say unto you, that
Publican went down justified more than that Pharisee: for every one that
exalteth himself shall be humbled; and he that humbleth himself shall be
exalted.” <span id="fr_3420"></span>[3421](#fn_3420.md) Thus hath been
explained a verse of this Psalm. God the Judge doth what? “One He
humbleth, and another He exalteth:” He humbleth the proud, He exalteth
the humble.

<span id="ii.LXXV-p42"></span>10. “For the cup in the hand of the Lord
of pure wine is full of mixed” ([Psa.
75.8](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#008)<span id="ii.LXXV-p42.1"></span>.md).
Justly so. “And He hath poured out of this upon this man; nevertheless,
the dreg thereof hath not been emptied; there shall drink all the
sinners of earth.” Let us be somewhat recruited; there is here some
obscurity.…The first question that meeteth us is this, “of pure wine it
is full of mixed.” How “of pure,” if “of mixed”? But when he saith, “the
cup in the hand of the Lord” (to men instructed in the Church of Christ
I am speaking), ye ought not indeed to paint in your heart God as it
were circumscribed with a human form, lest, though the temples are shut
up, ye forge images in your hearts. This cup therefore doth signify
something. We will find out this. But “in the hand of the Lord,” is, in
the power of the Lord. For the hand of God is spoken of for the power of
God. For even in reference to men ofttimes is said, in hand he hath it:
that is, in his power he hath it, when he chooseth he doth it. “Of pure
wine it is full of mixed.” In continuation he hath himself explained:
“He hath inclined,” he saith, “from this unto this man; nevertheless the
dreg thereof hath not been emptied.” Behold how it was full of mixed
wine. Let it not therefore terrify you that it is both pure and mixed:
pure because of the genuineness thereof, mixed because of the dreg. What
then in that place is the wine, and what the dreg? And what is, “He hath
inclined from this unto this man,” in such sort that the dreg thereof
was not emptied?

<span id="ii.LXXV-p43"></span>11. Call ye to mind from whence he came to
this: “one He humbleth, and another He exalteth.” <span
id="fr_3421"></span>[3422](#fn_3421.md) That which was figured to us in the
Gospel through two men, a Pharisee and a Publican, <span
id="fr_3422"></span>[3423](#fn_3422.md) this let us, taking in a wider
sense, understand of two peoples, of Jews and of Gentiles: the <span
id="page_354">p. 354</span> <span id="ii.LXXV-Page_354"></span>people of
the Jews that Pharisee was, the people of the Gentiles that Publican.…As
those by being proud have withdrawn, so these by confessing have drawn
near. The cup therefore full of pure wine in the hand of the Lord, as
far as the Lord giveth me to understand, <span
id="fr_3423"></span>[3424](#fn_3423.md) …the cup of pure wine full of the
mixed, seemeth to me to be the Law, which was given to the Jews, and all
that Scripture of the Old Testament, as it is called; there are the
weights of all manner of sentences. For therein the New Testament lieth
concealed, as though in the dreg of corporal Sacraments. The
circumcision of the flesh is a thing of great mystery, <span
id="fr_3424"></span>[3425](#fn_3424.md) and there is understood from thence
the circumcision of the heart. The Temple of Jerusalem is a thing of
great mystery, and there is understood from it the Body of the Lord. The
land of promise <span id="fr_3425"></span>[3426](#fn_3425.md) is understood
to be the Kingdom of Heaven. The sacrifice of victims and of beasts hath
a great mystery: but in all those kinds of sacrifices is understood that
one Sacrifice and only victim of the Cross, the Lord, instead of all
which sacrifices we have one; because even those figured these, that is,
with those these were figured. That people received the Law, they
received commandments just and good. <span
id="fr_3426"></span>[3427](#fn_3426.md) What is so just as, thou shalt not
kill, thou shalt not commit adultery, thou shalt not steal, thou shalt
not speak false testimony, honour thy father and mother, thou shalt not
covet the property of thy neighbour, one God thou shalt adore, and Him
alone thou shalt serve, <span id="fr_3427"></span>[3428](#fn_3427.md) all
these things belong to the wine. But those things carnal have as it were
sunk down in order that they might remain with them, and there might be
poured forth from thence all the spiritual understanding. But “the cup
in the hand of the Lord,” that is, in the power of the Lord: “of pure
wine,” that is, of the mere Law: “is full of mixed,” that is, is
together with the dreg of corporal Sacraments. And because the one He
humbleth, the proud Jew, and the other He exalteth, the confessing
Gentile; “He hath inclined from this unto this,” that is, from the
Jewish people unto the Gentile people. Hath inclined what? The Law.
There hath distilled from thence a spiritual sense. “Nevertheless, the
dreg thereof hath not been emptied,” for all the carnal Sacraments have
remained with the Jews. “There shall drink all the sinners of the
earth.” Who shall drink? “All the sinners of the earth.” Who are the
sinners of the earth? The Jews were indeed sinners, but proud: again,
the Gentiles were sinners, but humble. All sinners shall drink, but see,
who the dreg, who the wine. For those by drinking the dreg have come to
nought: these by drinking the wine have been justified. I would dare to
speak of them even as inebriated, and I shall not fear: and O that all
ye were thus inebriated. Call to mind, “Thy cup inebriating, how passing
beautiful!” <span id="fr_3428"></span>[3429](#fn_3428.md) But why? Do ye
think, my brethren, that all those who by confessing Christ even willed
to die, were sober? So drunk they were, that they knew not their
friends. All their kindred, who strove to divert them from the hope of
Heavenly rewards by earthly allurements, were not acknowledged, were not
heard by them drunken. Were they not drunken, whose heart had been
changed? Were they not drunken, whose mind had been alienated from this
world? “There shall drink,” he saith, “all the sinners of the earth.”
But who shall drink the wine? Sinners shall drink, but in order that
they may not remain sinners; in order that they may be justified, in
order that they may not be punished.

<span id="ii.LXXV-p52"></span>12. “But I,” for all drink, but separately
I, that is, Christ with His Body, “for ever will rejoice, I will Psalm
to the God of Jacob” ([Psa. 75.9](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#009.md)<span
id="ii.LXXV-p52.1"></span>): in that promise to be at the end, whereof
is said, “corrupt not.” <span id="fr_3429"></span>[3430](#fn_3429.md) “And
all the horns of sinners I will break, and there shall be exalted the
horns of the Just” ([Psa. 75.10](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#010.md)<span
id="ii.LXXV-p53.1"></span>). This is, the one He humbleth, the other He
exalteth. Sinners would not have their horns to be broken, which without
doubt will be broken at the end. Thou wilt not have Him then break them,
do thou to-day break them. For thou hast heard above, do not despise it:
“I have said to unjust men, Do not unjustly, and to the delinquents, Do
not exalt the horn.” <span id="fr_3430"></span>[3431](#fn_3430.md) When
thou hast heard, do not exalt the horn, thou hast despised and hast
exalted the horn: thou shalt come to the end, where there shall come to
pass, “All the horns of sinners I will break, and there shall be exalted
the horns of the Just.” The horns of sinners are the dignities of proud
men: the horns of the Just are the gifts of Christ. For by horns
exultations are understood. Thou hatest on earth earthly exultation, in
order that thou mayest have the heavenly. Thou lovest the earthly, He
doth not admit thee to the Heavenly: and unto confusion will belong thy
horn which is broken, just as unto glory it will belong, if thy horn is
exalted. Now therefore there is time for making choice, then there will
not be. Thou wilt not say, I will be let go and will make choice. For
there have preceded the words, “I have said to the unjust.” If I have
not said, make ready an excuse, make ready a <span id="page_355">p.
355</span> <span id="ii.LXXV-Page_355"></span>defence: but if I have
said, seize first upon confession, lest thou come unto damnation; for
then confession will be too late, and there will be no defence.

needs accord with the rule of faith: we neither envy our elders, nor,
