<span id="ii.CV"></span>

<span id="ii.CV-p1"></span> <span id="ii.CV-p1.1"></span><span
class="c20"><span id="ii.CV-p1.2"></span>Psalm CV. <span
id="fr_4776"></span>[4777](#fn_4776.md) </span>

<span id="ii.CV-p3"></span>1. This Psalm is the first of those to which
is prefixed the word Allelujah; the meaning of which word, or rather two
words, is, Praise the Lord. For this reason he beginneth with praises:
“O confess unto the Lord, and call upon His Name” ([Psa.
105.1](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#001)<span id="ii.CV-p3.1"></span>.md);
for this confession is to be understood as praise, just as these words
of our Lord, “I confess to Thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth.”
 <span id="fr_4777"></span>[4778](#fn_4777.md) For after commencing with
praise, calling upon God is wont to follow, whereunto he that prayeth
doth next add <span id="fr_4778"></span>[4779](#fn_4778.md) his longings:
whence the Lord’s Prayer itself hath at the commencement a very brief
praise, in these words, “Our Father which art in Heaven.” <span
id="fr_4779"></span>[4780](#fn_4779.md) The things prayed for, then
follow.…This also followeth, “Tell the people what things He hath
done;” <span id="fr_4780"></span>[4781](#fn_4780.md) or rather, to
translate literally from the Greek, as other Latin copies too have it,
“Preach the Gospel of His works among the Gentiles.” Unto whom is this
addressed, save unto the Evangelists in prophecy?

<span id="ii.CV-p8"></span>2. “O sing unto Him, and play on instruments
unto Him” ([Psa. 105.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#002.md)<span
id="ii.CV-p8.1"></span>). Praise Him both by word and deed; for we sing
with the voice, while we play with an instrument, that is, with our
hands. “Let your talking be of all His wondrous works. Be ye praise in
His holy Name” ([Psa. 105.3](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#003.md)<span
id="ii.CV-p8.2"></span>). These two verses may without any absurdity
seem paraphrases of the two words above; so that, “Let your talking be
of all His wondrous works,” may express the words, “O sing unto Him;”
and what followeth, “be ye praised in His holy Name,” may be referred to
the words, “and play on instruments unto Him;” the former relating to
the “good word” wherewith we sing unto Him, in which His wondrous works
are told; the latter to the good work, in which sweet music is played
unto Him, so that no man may wish to be praised for a good work on the
score of his own power to do it. For this reason, after saying, “be ye
praised,” which assuredly they who work well deservedly may, he added,
“in His holy Name,” since “he that glorieth, let him glory in the
Lord.” <span id="fr_4781"></span>[4782](#fn_4781.md) …This is to be praised
in His holy Name. Whence we read also in another Psalm: “My soul shall
be praised in the Lord: let the meek hear thereof, and be glad;” <span
id="fr_4782"></span>[4783](#fn_4782.md) which here in a sense followeth,
“Let the heart of them rejoice that seek the Lord:” for thus the meek
are glad, who do not rival with a bitter jealousy those whom they
imitate as already workers of good.

<span id="ii.CV-p11"></span>3. “Seek the Lord, and be
strengthened” <span id="fr_4783"></span>[4784](#fn_4783.md) ([Psa.
105.4](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#004)<span id="ii.CV-p12.1"></span>.md).
This is very literally construed from the Greek, though it may seem not
a Latin word: whence other copies have, “be ye confirmed;” others, “be
ye corroborated.”…While these words, then, “Come unto Him, and be
enlightened,” <span id="fr_4784"></span>[4785](#fn_4784.md) apply to
seeing; those in the text relate to doing: “Seek the Lord, and be
strengthened.”…But what meaneth, “Seek His face evermore”? I know indeed
that to cling unto God is good for me; <span
id="fr_4785"></span>[4786](#fn_4785.md) but if He is always being sought,
when is He found? Did he mean by “evermore,” the whole of the life we
live <span id="page_521">p. 521</span> <span
id="ii.CV-Page_521"></span>here, whence we become conscious that we
ought thus to seek, since even when found He is still to be sought? To
wit, faith hath already found Him, but hope still seeketh Him. But love
hath both found Him through faith, and seeketh to have Him by sight,
where He will then be found so as to satisfy us, and no longer to need
our search. For unless faith discovered Him in this life, it would not
be said, “Seek the Lord.” Also, if when discovered by faith, He were not
still to be diligently sought, it would not be said, “For if we hope for
that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.” <span
id="fr_4786"></span>[4787](#fn_4786.md) …And truly this is the sense of the
words, “Seek His face evermore;” meaning that discovery should not
terminate that seeking, by which love is testified, but with the
increase of love the seeking of the discovered One should increase.

<span id="ii.CV-p16"></span>4. “Remember,” he saith, “His marvellous
works that He hath done, His wonders, and the judgments of His mouth”
([Psa. 105.5](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#005.md)<span
id="ii.CV-p16.1"></span>). This passage seemeth like that, “Thou shalt
say unto the children of Israel, I <span class="c21"><span
id="ii.CV-p16.2"></span>Am</span> hath sent me unto you:” an expression
which, in ever so small part, scarce a mind <span
id="fr_4787"></span>[4788](#fn_4787.md) taketh in. Then mentioning His own
Name, He mercifully mingled in His grace towards men, saying, “I am the
God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob; this is My Name
for ever.” <span id="fr_4788"></span>[4789](#fn_4788.md) By which He would
have it to be understood, that they whose God He declared Himself lived
with Him for ever, and He said this, which might be understood even by
children, that they who by the great powers of love knew how to seek His
face for evermore, might according to their capacity comprehend, I <span
class="c21"><span id="ii.CV-p18.2"></span>Am that</span> I <span
class="c21"><span id="ii.CV-p18.3"></span> Am</span>.

<span id="ii.CV-p19"></span>5. Unto whom is it said, “O ye seed of
Abraham His servant, ye children of Jacob, His chosen”? ([Psa.
105.6](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#006.md)<span
id="ii.CV-p19.1"></span>).…He next addeth, “He is the Lord our God: His
judgments are in all the world” ([Psa.
105.7](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#007)<span id="ii.CV-p19.2"></span>.md).
Is He the God of the Jews only? <span
id="fr_4789"></span>[4790](#fn_4789.md) God forbid! “He is the Lord our
God:” because the Church, where His judgments are preached, is in all
the world.…

<span id="ii.CV-p21"></span>6. “He hath been alway mindful of His
covenant” ([Psa. 105.8](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#008.md)<span
id="ii.CV-p21.1"></span>). Other copies read, “for evermore;” and this
arises from the ambiguity of the Greek. But if we are to understand
“alway” of this world and not of eternity, why, when he explaineth what
covenant He was mindful of, doth he add, “The word that He made to a
thousand generations”? Now this may be understood with a certain
limitation; but he afterwards saith, “Even the covenant that He made
with Abraham” ([Psa. 105.9](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#009.md)<span
id="ii.CV-p21.2"></span>): “and the oath that He sware unto Isaac; and
appointed the same unto Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an
everlasting <span id="fr_4790"></span>[4791](#fn_4790.md) testament” ([Psa.
105.10](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#010)<span id="ii.CV-p22.6"></span>.md).
But if in this passage the Old Testament is to be understood, on account
of the land of Canaan; for thus the language of the Psalm runneth,
“saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan: the lot of your
inheritance” ([Psa. 105.11](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#011.md)<span
id="ii.CV-p22.7"></span>): how is it to be understood as everlasting,
since that earthly inheritance could not be everlasting? And for this
reason it is called the Old Testament, because it is abolished by the
New. But a thousand generations do not seem to signify anything eternal,
since they involve an end; and yet are also too numerous for this very
temporal state. For by howsoever few years a generation is limited, such
as in Greek is called <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.CV-p22.8"></span>γεν™α</span>, whereof the shortest period some
have fixed is at fifteen years, after which period man hath the power of
generation; what then are those “thousand generations,” not only from
the time of Abraham, when that promise was made him, unto the New
Testament, but from Adam himself down to the end of the world? For who
would dare to say that this world should last for 15000 years? Hence it
seemeth to me that we ought not to understand here the Old Testament,
which it said through the prophet was to be cancelled by the New:
“Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new
covenant.” <span id="fr_4791"></span>[4792](#fn_4791.md) …After saying, “He
hath been mindful of His covenant unto an age;” which we ought to
understand as lasting for evermore, the covenant, namely, of
justification and an eternal inheritance, which God hath promised to
faith; he addeth, “and the Word that He commanded <span
id="fr_4792"></span>[4793](#fn_4792.md) unto a thousand generations.” What
meaneth “commanded”?…The command then was faith, that the righteous
should live by faith; <span id="fr_4793"></span>[4794](#fn_4793.md) and an
eternal inheritance is set before this faith. “A thousand generations,”
then, are, on account of the perfect number, to be understood for all;
that is, as long as generation succeedeth generation, so long is it
commanded to us to live by faith. This the people of God doth observe,
the sons of promise who succeed by birth, and depart by death, until
every generation be finished; and this is signified by the number
thousand; because the solid square of the number ten, ten times ten, and
this taken ten times amounts to a thousand. “Even the covenant,” he
saith, “which He made with Abraham: and the oath that He sware unto
Isaac; and appointed the same unto Jacob,” that is, Jacob himself, “for
a law.” These are the very three <span id="page_522">p. 522</span> <span
id="ii.CV-Page_522"></span>patriarchs, whose God He calleth Himself in a
special sense, whom the Lord also doth name in the New Testament, where
He saith, “Many shall come from the east and the west, and shall sit
down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of
heaven.” <span id="fr_4794"></span>[4795](#fn_4794.md) This is everlasting
inheritance.…

<span id="ii.CV-p27"></span>7. He next followeth out the history well
known in the truth of the holy Scriptures. “When they were in small
numbers, very few, and they strangers in the land” ([Psa.
105.12](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#012)<span id="ii.CV-p27.1"></span>.md);
that is, in the land of Canaan.…But some copies have the words “very
few, and they strangers,” in the accusative case, <span
id="fr_4795"></span>[4796](#fn_4795.md) the translator having turned the
Greek phrase too literally into Latin. If we were to render the whole
clause in this way, we must say, “that they were very few, and they
strangers;” but the phrase, “while they were,” is the meaning of the
Greek; and the verb, “to be,” takes not an accusative, but a nominative
after it. <span id="fr_4796"></span>[4797](#fn_4796.md)

<span id="ii.CV-p30"></span>8. “What time as they went from one nation
to another, from one kingdom to another people” ([Psa.
105.13](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#013)<span id="ii.CV-p30.1"></span>.md).
This is a repetition of what he had said, “from one nation to another.”
“He suffered no man to do them harm: but reproved even kings for their
sakes” ([Psa. 105.14](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#014.md)<span
id="ii.CV-p30.2"></span>). “Touch not,” He said, “Mine anointed, and do
My prophets no harm” ([Psa.
105.15](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#015)<span id="ii.CV-p30.3"></span>.md).
He declareth the words of God chiding or reproving kings, that they
might not harm the holy fathers, while they were small in number, very
few, and they strangers in the land of Canaan. Although these words be
not read in the books of that history, yet they are to be understood as
either secretly spoken, as God speaketh in the hearts of men by unseen
and true visions, or even as announced through an Angel. For both the
king of Gerar and the king of the Egyptians were warned from Heaven not
to harm Abraham, <span id="fr_4797"></span>[4798](#fn_4797.md) and another
king not to harm Isaac, <span id="fr_4798"></span>[4799](#fn_4798.md) and
others not to harm Jacob; <span id="fr_4799"></span>[4800](#fn_4799.md)
while they were very few, and strangers, before he went over into Egypt
to sojourn with his sons: which is understood to be herein mentioned.
But since it occurred to ask, before they passed over and multiplied in
Egypt, how so few in number, and those strangers in a foreign land,
could maintain themselves: he next addeth, “He suffered no man to do
them wrong,” etc.

<span id="ii.CV-p34"></span>9. But it may well excite a question, in
what sense they were styled (Christs, or) anointed, before there was any
unction, from which this title was given to the kings. <span
id="fr_4800"></span>[4801](#fn_4800.md) …Whence then were those patriarchs
at that time called “anointed”? For that they were prophets, we read
concerning Abraham; and certainly, what is manifestly said of him,
should be understood of them also. Are they styled “christs,” because,
even though secretly, yet they were already Christians? For although the
flesh of Christ came from them, nevertheless Christ came before them;
for He thus answered the Jews, “Before Abraham was, I am.”  <span
id="fr_4801"></span>[4802](#fn_4801.md) But how could they not know Him, or
not believe in Him; since they are called prophets for this very reason,
because, though somewhat darkly, they announced the Lord beforehand?
Whence He saith Himself openly, “Your father Abraham desired to see My
day, and he saw it, and was glad.” <span
id="fr_4802"></span>[4803](#fn_4802.md) For no man was ever reconciled unto
God outside of that faith which is in Christ Jesus, either before His
Incarnation, or after: as it is most truly defined by the Apostle: “For
there is one God, and one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ
Jesus.” <span id="fr_4803"></span>[4804](#fn_4803.md)

<span id="ii.CV-p39"></span>10. He then beginneth to relate how it
happened that they went from one nation to another, from one kingdom to
another people. “He calleth,” he saith, “for a famine upon the land: and
brake all the staff of bread” ([Psa.
105.16](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#016)<span id="ii.CV-p39.1"></span>.md).
Thus it happened that they went from one nation to another, from one
kingdom to another people. But the expressions of the holy Scriptures
are not to be negligently passed by. “He called,” he saith, “for a
famine upon the land;” as if famine were some person, or some animated
body, or some spirit that would obey Him who called.…Under this
impression the old Romans consecrated some such deities, as the goddess
Fever, and the god Paleness. Or meaneth it, as is more credible, He said
there should be famine; so that calling be the same thing as mentioning
by name; mentioning by name, as speaking; speaking, as commanding? Nor
doth the Apostle say,  <span id="fr_4804"></span>[4805](#fn_4804.md) “He
calleth those things which be not, that they may be;” but, “as though
they were.” For with God that hath already happened which, according to
His disposition, is fixed for the future: for of Him it is elsewhere
said, “He who made things to come.” <span
id="fr_4805"></span>[4806](#fn_4805.md) And here when famine happened, then
it is said to have been called, that is, that that which had been
determined in His secret government, might be realized. Lastly, he at
once expounds, how He called for the famine, saying, “He brake all the
staff of bread.”

<span id="ii.CV-p42"></span>11. “But He had sent a man before them”
([Psa. 105.17](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#017.md)<span
id="ii.CV-p42.1"></span>). What man? “Even Joseph.” How did He send him?
“Joseph was sold to be a bond-servant.” When this happened, it was the
sin of his brethren, and, nevertheless, God sent Joseph into Egypt. We
should therefore meditate on this important and necessary subject, how
God useth well the evil works of men, as <span id="page_523">p.
523</span> <span id="ii.CV-Page_523"></span>they on the other hand use
ill the good works of God.

<span id="ii.CV-p43"></span>12. Next he doth relate the story,
mentioning what Joseph suffered in his low estate, and how he was raised
on high. “His feet they hurt in the stocks: the iron entered into his
soul, until his word came” ([Psa.
105.18](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#018)<span id="ii.CV-p43.1"></span>.md).
That Joseph was put in irons, we do not indeed read; but we ought no
ways to doubt that it was so. For some things might be passed over in
that history, which nevertheless would not escape the Holy Spirit, who
speaketh in these Psalms. We understand by the iron which entered into
his soul, the tribulation of stern necessity; for he did not say body,
but “soul.” There is a somewhat similar expression in the Gospel, where
Simeon saith unto Mary, “A sword shall pierce through thy own soul
also.” <span id="fr_4806"></span>[4807](#fn_4806.md) That is, the Passion
of the Lord, which was a fall unto many, and in which the secrets of
many hearts were revealed, since their sentiments respecting the Lord
were extorted from them, without doubt made His own Mother exceeding
sorrowful, heavily struck with human bereavement. Now Joseph was in this
tribulation, “until his word came,” with which he truly interpreted
dreams: whence he was introduced to the king, that unto him also he
might foretell what would happen in respect to his dreams. <span
id="fr_4807"></span>[4808](#fn_4807.md) But since he said, “Until his words
were heard,” that we might not altogether so understand “his,” that any
one might think so great an event was to be ascribed unto man; he at
once added, “The word of the Lord inflamed him” ([Psa.
105.19](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#019)<span id="ii.CV-p45.2"></span>.md);
or, as other copies have it more closely from the Greek, “The word of
the Lord fired him,” that he also might be reputed amongst those to whom
it is said, “Receive ye praise in His holy Name.” <span
id="fr_4808"></span>[4809](#fn_4808.md)

<span id="ii.CV-p47"></span>13. “The king sent and loosed him, the
prince of the peoples, and let him go free” ([Psa.
105.20](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#020)<span id="ii.CV-p47.1"></span>.md).
The “king” is the same as “the prince of the peoples:” he “loosed” him
from his bonds “and let him go free” from his prison. “He made him lord
also of his house: and ruler of all his substance” ([Psa.
105.21](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#021)<span id="ii.CV-p47.2"></span>.md).
“That he might inform his princes like unto himself, and teach his old
men wisdom” ([Psa. 105.22](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#022.md)<span
id="ii.CV-p47.3"></span>). The Greek hath, “and teach his elders
wisdom.” Which might altogether be rendered to the letter thus; “Might
inform his princes like unto himself, and make his elders wise.” The
word translated old men being presbyters or elders, not *gerontas,* old
men: and to teach wisdom being from the Greek to *sophize,* which cannot
be rendered by a single word in Latin, and is from the word *sophia,*
wisdom, different from prudence, which is in Greek *phronesis.* Yet we
do not read this in the high elevation of Joseph, as we read not of
fetters in his low estate. But how could it happen that so great a man,
the worshipper of the One True God, whilst in Egypt, should have been
intent upon the nourishing of bodies, and the government of carnal
matters only, and have felt no anxiety for souls, and how he could
render them better? But those things are written in that history, which,
according to the intention of the writer, in whom was the Holy Spirit,
were judged sufficient for signifying future events in that narration.

<span id="ii.CV-p48"></span>14. “Joseph also came into Egypt, and Jacob
was a stranger in the land of Ham” ([Psa.
105.23](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#023)<span id="ii.CV-p48.1"></span>.md).
Israel is the same with Jacob, as is Egypt with the land of Ham. Here it
is very plainly shown, that the Egyptian race sprang from the seed of
Chain, the son of Noah, whose first-born was Canaan. So that in those
copies wherein in this passage Canaan is read, we must alter the
reading. It is better construed, “was a stranger,” than “dwelt,” as
other copies have it: which would be the same as “was an inhabitant,”
for it meaneth nothing different; the very same word is used in the
Greek passage above, where it is said, “Very few, and they strangers in
the land.” Moreover, the state of an *incola* or *accola* doth not
signify a native, but a stranger. Behold how “they went from one nation
to another.” What had been briefly proposed, hath been briefly explained
in the narration. But from what kingdom they passed over to another
people may well be asked. For they were not yet reigning in the land of
Canaan, because the kingdom of the people of Israel had not yet been
established there. How then can it be understood, except by
anticipation, because the kingdom of their seed was destined there to
exist?

<span id="ii.CV-p49"></span>15. Next is related what happened in Egypt.
“And He increased,” he saith, “His people exceedingly, and made them
stronger than their enemies” ([Psa.
105.24](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#024)<span id="ii.CV-p49.1"></span>.md).
Even the whole of this is briefly set forth, in order that the manner in
which it took place may be afterwards related. For the people of God was
not made stronger than their enemies the Egyptians, at the time when
their male offspring were slain, or when they were worn out with making
bricks; but when by His powerful hand, by the signs and portents of the
Lord their God, they became objects of fear and of honour, until the
opposition of the hardened king was overcome, and the Red Sea
overwhelmed the persecutor with his army.

<span id="ii.CV-p50"></span>16. “And He turned their heart so, that they
hated His people, and dealt untruly with His servants” ([Psa.
105.25](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#025)<span id="ii.CV-p50.1"></span>.md).
Is it to be in any wise understood or believed, that God turneth man’s
heart to do sin?…For they were not good before they hated His people;
but being malignant and <span id="page_524">p. 524</span> <span
id="ii.CV-Page_524"></span>ungodly, they were such as would readily envy
their prosperous sojourners. And so, in that He multiplied His own
people, this bountiful act turned the wicked to envy. For envy is the
hatred of another’s prosperity. In this sense, therefore, He turned
their heart, so that through envy they hated His people, and dealt
untruly with His servants. It was not then by making their hearts evil,
but by doing good to His people, that He turned their hearts, that were
evil of their own accord, to hatred. For He did not pervert a righteous
heart, but turned one perverted of its own accord to the hatred of His
people, while He was to make a good use of that evil; <span
id="fr_4809"></span>[4810](#fn_4809.md) not by making them evil, but by
lavishing blessings upon those, which the wicked might most readily
envy.

<span id="ii.CV-p52"></span>17. The following verses, which are sung in
praise of Him when Allelujah is chanted, show how He used this hatred of
theirs, both for the trial of His own people, and for the glory of His
Name, which is profitable for us. “He sent Moses His servant, and Aaron
whom He had chosen *him*” ([Psa.
105.26](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#026)<span id="ii.CV-p52.1"></span>.md).
“Whom He had chosen,” would be sufficient; but there is no difficulty in
the addition of “him.” It is a phrase of Scripture, as, “The land in
which they shall dwell in it:” <span
id="fr_4810"></span>[4811](#fn_4810.md) a phrase which the divine pages are
full of.

<span id="ii.CV-p54"></span>18. “He set forth in them the words of His
tokens, and of His wonders in the land of Ham” ([Psa.
105.27](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#027)<span id="ii.CV-p54.1"></span>.md).
We ought not to understand by “the words of His tokens,” words
literally, words with which the tokens and wonders were worked, that is,
which they uttered, that these tokens and wonders might take place. For
many were performed without words, either with a rod, or with
outstretched hand, or by ashes sent towards heaven.…

<span id="ii.CV-p55"></span>19. “He sent darkness, and made it dark”
([Psa. 105.28](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#028.md)<span
id="ii.CV-p55.1"></span>). This is also written among the plagues with
which the Egyptians were smitten. But what followeth, is variously read
in different copies. For some have, “and they provoked His words;” while
others read, “and they provoked not His words;” but the reading first
mentioned we have found in most; while, where the negative particle is
added, we could hardly discover two copies. But perhaps the false
reading has abounded owing to the easy sense; for what is easier
understood than this, “They provoked His words,” that is, by their
contumacious rebellions? We have endeavoured to explain the other
reading also according to some true sense: and this for the present
occurs: “They provoked not His words,” that is, in Moses and Aaron;
because they most patiently bore with a very stiffnecked people, until
all things which God had determined to work by them, were fulfilled in
order.

<span id="ii.CV-p56"></span>20. “He turned their waters into blood, and
slew their fish” ([Psa. 105.29](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#029.md)<span
id="ii.CV-p56.1"></span>). “He made their land frogs, yea, even in the
king’s chambers” ([Psa. 105.30](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#030.md)<span
id="ii.CV-p56.2"></span>): as if he were to say, He turned their land
into frogs. For there was so great a multitude of frogs, that this might
well be said by hyperbole.

<span id="ii.CV-p57"></span>21. “He spake the word, and there came all
manner of flies, and lice in all their quarters” ([Psa.
105.31](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#031)<span id="ii.CV-p57.1"></span>.md).
If it be asked when He spake, it was in His Word before it took place;
and there it was, without time, at what time it should take place:
although even then He commanded it to be done, when it was to be done,
through Angels, and through his servants Moses and Aaron.

<span id="ii.CV-p58"></span>22. He made their rains hail” ([Psa.
105.32](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#032)<span id="ii.CV-p58.1"></span>.md).
It is a similar expression to the former, “He made their land frogs;”
except that the whole land was not actually turned into frogs, though
the whole of the rain may have been turned into hail. “A burning fire in
their land:” understand, “He sent.”

<span id="ii.CV-p59"></span>23. “He smote their vines also and
fig-trees; and brake every tree of their coasts” ([Psa.
105.33](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#033)<span id="ii.CV-p59.1"></span>.md).
This was done by the violence of the hail, and by lightnings; whence he
spoke of the fire as “burning.”

<span id="ii.CV-p60"></span>24. “He spake the word, and the locust came,
and the caterpillar, of which there was no number” ([Psa.
105.34](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#034)<span id="ii.CV-p60.1"></span>.md).
The locusts and the caterpillars are one plague: of which the one is the
parent, the other the offspring.

<span id="ii.CV-p61"></span>25. “And did eat up all the grass in their
land, and devoured the fruit of the ground” ([Psa.
105.35](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#035)<span id="ii.CV-p61.1"></span>.md).
Even grass is fruit, as Scripture is wont to speak, which calleth even
the ripe corn grass; but it wished these two things to harmonize in
number with the two which it had spoken of before, that is, the locust
and the caterpillar. But the whole of this doth belong to the variety of
speech, which is a remedy for weariness, not to any difference of
senses.

<span id="ii.CV-p62"></span>26. “He smote every first-born in their
land: even the first-fruits of all their strength” ([Psa.
105.36](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#036)<span id="ii.CV-p62.1"></span>.md).
This is the last plague, excepting the death in the Red Sea. “The
first-fruits of all their strength,” I imagine to be an expression
derived from the first-born of cattle. These plagues are ten in number,
but they are not all mentioned, nor in the same order in which they are
there read to have happened. For praise-giving is free from the law
which bindeth one who is relating or composing a history. And since the
Holy Spirit is the Author and Dictator, through the Prophet, of this
praise; by the very same authority with which He guided him who wrote
that history, he doth both mention some<span id="page_525">p. 525</span>
<span id="ii.CV-Page_525"></span>thing to have taken place which is not
there read, and passeth over what is there read.

<span id="ii.CV-p63"></span>27. Now he addeth this also to the praises
of God, that He led the Israelites out of Egypt enriched with silver and
gold; because even they were then in such a condition, that they could
not as yet despise the just and due, though temporal, reward of their
toils.…“He brought them forth also in silver and gold” ([Psa.
105.37](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#037)<span id="ii.CV-p63.1"></span>.md):
this too is a Scripture idiom; for “in silver and gold” is said for the
same as if it had been said “with silver and gold: there was not one
feeble person among their tribes:” in body, not in mind. This also was a
great blessing of God, that in this necessity of removal there was no
infirm person.

<span id="ii.CV-p64"></span>28. “Egypt was glad at their departing: for
their fear fell upon them” ([Psa.
105.38](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#038)<span id="ii.CV-p64.1"></span>.md);
that is, the fear of the Hebrews upon the Egyptians. For “their fear” is
not that with which the Hebrews feared, but that with which they were
feared. Some one will say, how then were the Egyptians unwilling to
dismiss them? why did they let them go as if they expected them to
return? why did they lend them gold and silver, as to men who were to
return, and to repay them, if “Egypt was glad at their departing”? But
we must understand, after that final destruction of the Egyptians, and
the terrible overthrow of the mighty pursuing army in the Red Sea, that
the rest of the Egyptians feared lest the Hebrews should return, and
with great ease crush the relics of them: illustrating what he had
stated, that He made His people stronger than their enemies.

<span id="ii.CV-p65"></span>29. He now proceedeth to the divine
blessings which were conferred upon them as they wandered in the desert.
“He spread out a cloud to be their covering: and fire to give them light
in the night season” ([Psa.
105.39](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#039)<span id="ii.CV-p65.1"></span>.md).
This is as clear as it is well known.

<span id="ii.CV-p66"></span>30. “They asked, and the quail came” ([Psa.
105.40](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#040)<span id="ii.CV-p66.1"></span>.md).
They did not desire quails, but flesh. But since the quail is flesh, and
in this Psalm he speaketh not of the provocation of those who did not
please God, but of the faith of the elect, the true seed of Abraham;
they are to be understood to have desired that that might come which
might crush the murmurs of those who provoked. Then in the next line,
“And He filled them with the bread of heaven,” he has not indeed named
manna, but it is obscure to none who hath read those records.

<span id="ii.CV-p67"></span>31. “He opened the rock of stone, and the
waters flowed out: so that rivers ran in the dry places” ([Psa.
105.41](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#041)<span id="ii.CV-p67.1"></span>.md).
This fact too is understood as soon as read.

<span id="ii.CV-p68"></span>32. But in all these blessings of His, God
doth commend in Abraham the merit of faith. For the Psalmist goeth on to
say, “For why? He remembered His holy promise, which He made to Abraham
His servant” ([Psa. 105.42](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#042.md)<span
id="ii.CV-p68.1"></span>). “And He brought forth His people with joy,
and His chosen with gladness” ([Psa.
105.43](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#043)<span id="ii.CV-p68.2"></span>.md).
What he said, “His people,” he has repeated in, “His chosen.” So also
what he said, “with joy,” he has repeated in, “with gladness.” “And gave
them the lands of the heathen: and they took the labours of the people
in possession” ([Psa. 105.44](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#044.md)<span
id="ii.CV-p68.3"></span>). “The lands of the heathen,” and “the labours
of the people,” are the same; and the words, “He gave,” are repeated in
these, “they took in possession.”

<span id="ii.CV-p69"></span>33. …“That they may keep His statutes, and
seek out His law” ([Psa. 105.45](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#045.md)<span
id="ii.CV-p69.1"></span>). Lastly, since by the seed of Abraham he
wished those to be understood here, who were truly the seed of Abraham,
such as were not wanting even in that people; as the Apostle Paul
clearly showeth, when he saith, “But not in all of them was God well
pleased;” <span id="fr_4811"></span>[4812](#fn_4811.md) for if He was not
pleased with all, surely there were some in whom He was well pleased:
since then this Psalm praiseth such men as this, he hath said nothing
here of the iniquities and provocations and bitterness of those with
whom God was not well pleased. But since not only the justice but also
the mercy of Almighty God, the merciful, was shown even unto the wicked;
concerning these attributes the rest of the Psalm pursueth the praises
of God. And yet both sorts were in one people: nor did the latter
pollute the good with the contagion of their iniquities. For “the Lord
knoweth who are His;” <span id="fr_4812"></span>[4813](#fn_4812.md) and if
he cannot separate in this world from wicked men, yet, “let every one
that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.”…
