<span id="ii.CXIX.xvii"></span>

<span id="ii.CXIX.xvii-p1"></span> *<span class="c2"><span
id="ii.CXIX.xvii-p1.1"></span>Pe.</span>*

<span id="ii.CXIX.xvii-p2"></span>128. “Thy testimonies are wonderful:
therefore hath my soul searched them” ([Psa.
119.129](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#129)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xvii-p2.1"></span>). Who counteth, even by their kinds, the
testimonies of God? Heaven and earth, His visible and invisible works,
declare in some manner the testimony of His goodness and greatness; and
the very ordinary and accustomed course of nature, whereby the seasons
are rapidly revolved, in all things after their kinds, however temporal
and perishable, however held cheap through our constant experience of
them, give, if a pious thinker give heed to them, a testimony to the
Creator. But which of these is not wonderful, if we measure each not by
its habitual presence, but by reason? But if we venture to bring all
nature within the comprehensive view of one act of contemplation, doth
not that take place in us which the prophet describeth, “I considered
Thy works, and trembled”? <span id="fr_5318"></span>[5319](#fn_5318) Yet
the Psalmist was not terrified in his wonder at creation, but rather
said that this was the reason that he ought to search it, because it was
wonderful. For after saying, “Thy testimonies are wonderful,” he addeth,
“therefore hath my soul searched them;” as if he had become more curious
from the difficulty of thoroughly searching them. For the more abstruse
are the causes of anything, the more wonderful it is…

<span id="ii.CXIX.xvii-p4"></span>129. “When thy word goeth forth,” he
saith, “it giveth light, and maketh His little ones to understand”
([Psa. 119.130](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#130)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xvii-p4.1"></span>). What is the little one save the humble
and weak? Be not proud therefore, presume not in thine own strength,
which is nought; and thou wilt understand why a good law was given by a
good God, though it cannot give life. For it was given for this end,
that it might make thee a little one instead of great, that it might
show that thou hadst not strength to do the law of thine own power: and
that thus, wanting aid and destitute, thou mightest fly unto grace,
saying, “Have mercy upon me, O Lord, for I am weak.” <span
id="fr_5319"></span>[5320](#fn_5319) …Let all be little ones, and let
all the world be guilty before Thee: because “by the deeds of the Law
there shall no flesh be justified” in Thy sight; “for by the Law is the
knowledge of sin,” etc. <span id="fr_5320"></span>[5321](#fn_5320) These
are Thy wonderful testimonies, which the soul of this little one hath
searched; and hath therefore found, because he became humbled and a
little one. For who doth Thy commandments as they ought to be done, that
is, by “faith which worketh through love,” <span
id="fr_5321"></span>[5322](#fn_5321) save love itself be shed abroad in
his heart through the Holy Spirit? <span
id="fr_5322"></span>[5323](#fn_5322)

<span id="ii.CXIX.xvii-p9"></span>130. This is confessed by this little
one; “I opened my mouth,” he saith, “and drew in the spirit: for I
longed for Thy commandments” ([Psa.
119.131](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#131)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xvii-p9.1"></span>). What did he long for, save to obey the
divine commandments? But there was no possibility of the weak doing hard
things, the little one great things: he opened his mouth, confessing
that he could not do them of himself: and drew in power to do them: he
opened his mouth, by seeking, asking, knocking: <span
id="fr_5323"></span>[5324](#fn_5323) and athirst drank in the good
Spirit, which enabled him to do what he could not do by himself, “the
commandment holy and just and good.” <span
id="fr_5324"></span>[5325](#fn_5324) Not that they themselves who “are
led by the Spirit of God,” <span id="fr_5325"></span>[5326](#fn_5325) do
nothing; but that they may not do nothing good, they are moved to act by
the good Spirit. For so much the more is every man made a good son, in
proportion as the good Spirit is given unto Him by the Father in a
greater measure.

<span id="ii.CXIX.xvii-p13"></span>131. He still prayeth. He hath opened
his mouth, and drawn in the Spirit; but he still knocketh in prayer unto
the Father, and seeketh: he drinketh, but the more sweet he findeth it,
the more eagerly doth he thirst. Hear the words of him in his thirst. “O
look Thou upon me,” he saith, “and be merciful unto me: according to the
judgment of those that love Thy Name” ([Psa.
119.132](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#132)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xvii-p13.1"></span>): that is, according to the judgment
Thou has dealt unto all who love Thy Name; since Thou hast first loved
them, to cause them to love Thee. For thus saith the Apostle John, “We
love God, because He first loved us.” <span
id="fr_5326"></span>[5327](#fn_5326)

<span id="ii.CXIX.xvii-p15"></span>132. See what the Psalmist next most
openly saith: “Order my steps after Thy word: and so shall no wickedness
have dominion over me” ([Psa.
119.133](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#133)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xvii-p15.1"></span>). Where what else doth he say than this,
Make me upright and free according to Thy promise. But so much the more
as the love of God reigneth in every man, so much the less hath
wickedness dominion over him. What else then doth he seek than that by
the gift of God he may love God? For by loving God he loveth himself, so
that he may healthily love his neighbour also as himself: on which
commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets. <span
id="fr_5327"></span>[5328](#fn_5327) What then doth he pray, save that
God may cause the fulfillment by His help of those commandments which He
imposeth by His bidding?

<span id="ii.CXIX.xvii-p17"></span>133. But what meaneth this that he
saith, “O deliver me from the calumnies of men: so shall I keep Thy
commandments”? ([Psa. 119.134](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#134)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xvii-p17.1"></span>)…<span id="page_583">p. 583</span> <span
id="ii.CXIX.xvii-Page_583"></span>Did not the holy people of God much
the more gloriously keep the commandments among these very calumnies,
when they were at their hottest in the midst of tribulations, when they
yielded not to their persecutors to commit impieties? But, in truth, the
meaning of these words is this: Do Thou, by pouring upon me Thy Spirit,
guard me from being overcome by the terrors of human calumny, and from
being drawn over to their evil deeds away from Thy commandments. For if
Thou hast thus dealt with me, that is, if Thou hast in this manner
delivered me by the gift of patience from their calumnies, so that I
fear not the false charges they prefer against me; among those very
calumnies I will keep Thy commandments.

<span id="ii.CXIX.xvii-p18"></span>134. “Show the light of Thy
countenance on Thy servant, and teach me thy statutes” ([Psa.
119.135](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#135)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xvii-p18.1"></span>): that is, manifest Thy presence, by
succouring and aiding me. “And teach me Thy righteousnesses.” Teach me
to work them: as it is more plainly expressed elsewhere, “Teach me to do
Thy will.” <span id="fr_5328"></span>[5329](#fn_5328) For they who hear,
although they retain in their memories what they hear, are by no means
to be considered to have learnt, unless they do. For it is the word of
Truth: “Every man that hath heard and hath learned of the Father, cometh
unto Me.” <span id="fr_5329"></span>[5330](#fn_5329) He therefore who
obeyeth not in deed, that is, who cometh not, hath not learnt.

<span id="ii.CXIX.xvii-p21"></span>135. “My eyes have descended streams
of waters, because they have not kept Thy law” ([Psa.
119.136](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#136)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xvii-p21.1"></span>): that is, my eyes. For in some copies
there is this reading, “Because I have not kept Thy law, streams of
waters” therefore “descended,” that is, floods of tears. <span
id="fr_5330"></span>[5331](#fn_5330) …
