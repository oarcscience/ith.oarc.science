<span id="ii.XXVII-p1"></span> <span id="ii.XXVII-p1.1"></span><span
class="c20"><span id="ii.XXVII-p1.2"></span>Psalm XXVII. <span
id="fr_648"></span>[649](#fn_648.md) </span>

<span id="ii.XXVII-p3"></span>*Of David himself, before he was
anointed.* <span id="fr_649"></span>[650](#fn_649.md)

<span id="ii.XXVII-p5"></span>1. Christ’s young soldier speaketh, on his
coming to the faith. “The Lord is my light, and my salvation: whom shall
I fear?” ([Psa. 27.1](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#001.md)<span
id="ii.XXVII-p5.1"></span>). The Lord will give me both knowledge of
Himself, and salvation: who shall take me from Him? “The Lord is the
Protector of my life: of whom shall I be afraid?” The Lord will repel
all the assaults and snares of mine enemy: of no man shall I be afraid.

<span id="ii.XXVII-p6"></span>2. “Whilst the guilty approach unto me to
eat up my flesh” ([Psa. 27.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#002.md)<span
id="ii.XXVII-p6.1"></span>). Whilst the guilty come near to recognise
and insult me, that they may exalt themselves above me in my change for
the better; that with their reviling tooth they may consume not me, but
rather my fleshly desires. “Mine enemies who trouble me.” Not they only
who trouble me, blaming me with a friendly intent, and wishing to recall
me from my purpose, but mine enemies also. “They became weak, and
fell.” <span id="fr_650"></span>[651](#fn_650.md) Whilst then they do this
with the desire of defending their own opinion, they became weak to
believe better things, and began to hate the word of salvation, whereby
I do what displeases them.

<span id="ii.XXVII-p8"></span>3. “If camps stand together against me, my
heart will not fear.” But if the multitude of gain-sayers conspire to
stand together against me, my heart will not fear, so as to go over to
their side. “If war rise up against me, in this will I trust” ([Psa.
27.3](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#003)<span id="ii.XXVII-p8.1"></span>.md).
If the persecution of this world arise against me, in this petition,
which I am pondering, will I place my hope.

<span id="ii.XXVII-p9"></span>4. “One have I asked of the Lord, this
will I require.” For one petition have I asked the Lord, this will I
require. “That I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my
life” ([Psa. 27.4](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#004.md)<span
id="ii.XXVII-p9.1"></span>). That as long as I am in this life, no
adversities may exclude me from the number of them who hold the unity
and the truth of the Lord’s faith throughout the world. “That I may
contemplate the delight of the Lord.” With this end, namely, that
persevering in the faith, the delightsome vision may appear to me, which
I may contemplate face to face. “And I shall be protected, His temple.”
And death being swallowed up in victory, I shall be clothed with
immortality, being made His temple. <span
id="fr_651"></span>[652](#fn_651.md)

<span id="ii.XXVII-p11"></span>5. “For He hath hidden me in His
tabernacle in the day of my evils” ([Psa.
27.5](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#005.md)<span
id="ii.XXVII-p11.1"></span>). For He hath hidden me in the dispensation
of His Incarnate Word in the time of temptations, to which my mortal
life is exposed. “He hath protected me in the secret place of His
tabernacle.” He hath protected me, with the heart believing unto
righteousness.

<span id="ii.XXVII-p12"></span>6. “On a rock hath He exalted me.” And
that what I believed might be made manifest for salvation, He hath made
my confession to be conspicuous in His own strength. “And now, lo! He
hath exalted mine head above mine enemies” ([Psa.
27.6](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#006.md)<span
id="ii.XXVII-p12.1"></span>). What doth He reserve for me <span
id="page_65">p. 65</span> <span id="ii.XXVII-Page_65"></span>at the
last, when even now the body is dead because of sin, lo! I feel that my
mind serves the law of God, and is not led captive under the rebellious
law of sin? “I have gone about, and have sacrificed in His tabernacle
the sacrifice of rejoicing.” I have considered the circuit of the world,
believing on Christ; and in that for us God was humbled in time, I have
praised Him with rejoicing: for with such sacrifice He is well pleased.
“I will sing and give praises to the Lord.” In heart and in deed I will
be glad in the Lord.

<span id="ii.XXVII-p13"></span>7. “Hear my voice, O Lord, wherewith I
have cried unto Thee” ([Psa. 27.7](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#007.md)<span
id="ii.XXVII-p13.1"></span>). Hear, Lord, my interior voice, which with
a strong intention I have addressed to Thy ears. “Have mercy upon me,
and hear me.” Have mercy upon me, and hear me therein.

<span id="ii.XXVII-p14"></span>8. “My heart hath said to Thee, I have
sought Thy countenance” ([Psa.
27.8](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#008.md)<span
id="ii.XXVII-p14.1"></span>). For I have not exhibited myself to men;
but in secret, where Thou alone hearest, my heart hath said to Thee; I
have not sought from Thee aught without Thee as a reward, but Thy
countenance. “Thy countenance, O Lord, will I seek.” In thus search will
I perseveringly persist: for not aught that is common, but Thy
countenance, O Lord, will I seek, that I may love Thee freely, since
nothing more precious do I find.

<span id="ii.XXVII-p15"></span>9. “Turn not away Thy face from me”
([Psa. 27.9](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#009.md)<span
id="ii.XXVII-p15.1"></span>): that I may find what I seek. “Turn not
aside in anger from Thy servant:” lest, while seeking Thee, I fall in
with somewhat else. For what is more grievous than this punishment to
one who loveth and seeketh the truth of Thy countenance? “Be Thou my
Helper.” How shall I find it, if Thou help me not? “Leave me not,
neither despise me, O God my Saviour.” Scorn not that a mortal dares to
seek the Eternal; for Thou, God, dost heal the wound of my sin.

<span id="ii.XXVII-p16"></span>10. “For my father and my mother have
left me” (<span id="ii.XXVII-p16.1"></span>ver. 10). For the kingdom of
this world and the city of this world, of which I was born in time and
mortality, have left me seeking Thee, and despising what they promised,
since they could not give what I seek. “But the Lord took me up.” But
the Lord, who can give me Himself, took me up.

<span id="ii.XXVII-p17"></span>11. “Appoint me a law, O Lord, in Thy
way” ([Psa. 27.11](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#011.md)<span
id="ii.XXVII-p17.1"></span>). For me then who am setting out toward
Thee, and commenting so great a profession, of arriving at wisdom, from
fear, appoint, O Lord, a law in Thy way, lest in my wandering Thy rule
abandon me. “And direct me in the right path because of mine enemies.”
And direct me in the right way of its straits. For it is not enough to
begin, since enemies cease not until the end is attained.

<span id="ii.XXVII-p18"></span>12. “Deliver me not up unto the souls of
them that trouble me” ([Psa.
27.12](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#012.md)<span
id="ii.XXVII-p18.1"></span>). Suffer not them that trouble me to be
satiated with my evils. “For unrighteous witnesses have risen up against
me.” For there have risen up against me they that speak falsely of me,
to remove and call me back from Thee, as if I seek glory of men. “And
iniquity hath lied unto itself.” Therefore iniquity hath been pleased
with its own lie. For me it hath not moved, to whom because of this
there hath been promised a greater reward in heaven.

<span id="ii.XXVII-p19"></span>13. “I believe to see the good things of
the Lord in the land of the living” ([Psa.
27.13](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#013.md)<span
id="ii.XXVII-p19.1"></span>). And since my Lord hath first suffered
these things, if I too despise the tongues of the dying (“for the mouth
that lieth slayeth the soul” <span id="fr_652"></span>[653](#fn_652) .md),
I believe to see the good things of the Lord in the land of the living,
where there is no place for falsity.

<span id="ii.XXVII-p21"></span>14. “Wait on the Lord, quit thyself like
a man: and let thy heart be strong, yea wait on the Lord” ([Psa.
27.14](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#014.md)<span
id="ii.XXVII-p21.1"></span>). But when shall this be? It is arduous for
a mortal, it is slow to a lover: but listen to the voice, that deceiveth
not, of him that saith, “Wait on the Lord.” Endure the burning of the
reins manfully, and the burning of the heart stoutly. Think not that
what thou dost not as yet receive is denied thee. That thou faint not in
despair, see how it is said, “Wait on the Lord.” <span
