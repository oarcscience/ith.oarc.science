<span id="ii.CXIX.xxii-p1"></span> *<span class="c2"><span
id="ii.CXIX.xxii-p1.1"></span>Tau.</span>*

<span id="ii.CXIX.xxii-p2"></span>166. Let us now hear the words of one
praying: since we know who is praying, and we recognise ourselves, if we
be not reprobate, among the members of this one praying. “Let my prayer
come near in Thy sight, O Lord” ([Psa.
119.169](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#169.md)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xxii-p2.1"></span>): for, “The Lord is nigh unto them that
are of a contrite heart.” <span id="fr_5380"></span>[5381](#fn_5380.md)
“Give me understanding, according to Thy word.” He claimeth a promise.
For he saith, “according to Thy word,” which is to say, according to Thy
promise. For the Lord promised this when He said, “I will inform
thee.” <span id="fr_5381"></span>[5382](#fn_5381.md)

<span id="ii.CXIX.xxii-p5"></span>167. “Let my request come before Thy
presence, O Lord: deliver me, according to Thy word” ([Psa.
119.170](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#170.md)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xxii-p5.1"></span>). He repeateth what he hath asked. For
his former words, “Let my prayer come near in Thy presence, O Lord:” are
like unto what he saith, “Let my request come before Thy presence, O
Lord:” and the words, “Give me understanding according to Thy word,”
agree with these, “Deliver me according to Thy word.” For by receiving
understanding he is delivered, who of himself through want of
understanding is deceived.

<span id="ii.CXIX.xxii-p6"></span>168. “My lips shall burst forth
praise: when Thou hast taught me Thy righteousnesses” ([Psa.
119.171](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#171.md)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xxii-p6.1"></span>). We know how God teacheth those who are
docile unto God. For every one who hath heard from the Father and hath
learned, comes unto Him “who justifieth the ungodly:” <span
id="fr_5382"></span>[5383](#fn_5382.md) so that he may keep the
righteousnesses of God not only by retaining them in his memory, but
also by doing them. Thus doth he who glorieth, glory not in himself, but
in the Lord, <span id="fr_5383"></span>[5384](#fn_5383.md) and burst forth
praise.

<span id="ii.CXIX.xxii-p9"></span>169. But as he hath now learned, and
praised God his Teacher, he next wisheth to teach. “Yea, my tongue shall
declare Thy word: for all Thy commandments are righteousness” ([Psa.
119.172](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#172.md)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xxii-p9.1"></span>). When he saith that he will declare
these things, he becometh a minister of the word. For though God teach
within, nevertheless “faith cometh from hearing: and how do they hear
without a preacher?” <span id="fr_5384"></span>[5385](#fn_5384.md) For,
because “God giveth the increase,” <span
id="fr_5385"></span>[5386](#fn_5385.md) is no reason why we need not plant
and water.

<span id="ii.CXIX.xxii-p12"></span>170. “Let Thy hand be stretched forth
(*fiat*, be made) to save me, for I have chosen Thy commandments” ([Psa.
119.173](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#173.md)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xxii-p12.1"></span>). That I might not fear, and that not
only might my heart hold fast, but my tongue also utter Thy words: “I
have chosen Thy commandments,” and have stifled fear with love. Let Thy
hand therefore be stretched forth, to save me from another’s hand. Thus
God saved the Martyrs, when He permitted them not to be slain in their
souls: for “vain is the safety of man” <span
id="fr_5386"></span>[5387](#fn_5386.md) in the flesh. The words, “Let Thy
hand be made,” may also be taken to mean Christ the Hand of
God…Certainly where we read the following words, “I have longed for Thy
salvation, O Lord” ([Psa. 119.174](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#174.md)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xxii-p13.2"></span>): even if all our foes be reluctant, let
Christ the Salvation of God occur to us: the righteous men of old
confess that they longed for Him, the Church longed for His destined
coming from His mother’s womb, the Church longeth for His coming at His
Father’s right hand. Subjoined to this sentence are the words, “And Thy
law is my meditation:” for the Law giveth testimony unto Christ.

<span id="ii.CXIX.xxii-p14"></span>171. But in this faith, though the
heathen rage furiously, and the people imagine a vain thing: <span
id="fr_5387"></span>[5388](#fn_5387.md) though the flesh be slain while it
preacheth Thee: “My soul shall live, and shall praise Thee: and Thy
judgments shall help me” ([Psa.
119.175](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#175.md)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xxii-p15.2"></span>). These are those judgments, which it
was time should begin at the house of the Lord. <span
id="fr_5388"></span>[5389](#fn_5388.md) But “they will help me,” he saith.
And who cannot see how much the blood of the Church hath aided the
Church? how great a harvest hath risen in the whole world from that
sowing?

<span id="ii.CXIX.xxii-p17"></span>172. At last he openeth himself
completely, and showeth what person was speaking throughout the whole
Psalm. “I have gone astray,” he saith, “like a sheep that is lost: O
seek <span id="fr_5389"></span>[5390](#fn_5389.md) Thy servant, for I do
not forget Thy commandments” ([Psa.
119.176](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#176.md)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xxii-p18.3"></span>). Let the lost sheep be sought, let the
lost sheep be quickened, for whose sake its Shepherd left the ninety and
nine in the wilderness, <span id="fr_5390"></span>[5391](#fn_5390.md) and
while seeking it, was torn by Jewish thorns. But it is still being
sought, let it still be sought, partly found let it still be sought. For
as to that company, among whom the Psalmist saith, “I do not forget Thy
commandments,” it hath been found; but through those who choose the
commandments of God, <span id="page_589">p. 589</span> <span
id="ii.CXIX.xxii-Page_589"></span>gather them together, love them, it is
still sought, and by means of the blood of its Shepherd shed and
sprinkled abroad, it is found in all nations. <span
id="fr_5391"></span>[5392](#fn_5391.md)

<span id="ii.CXIX.xxii-p20"></span> \[He adds: “As far as I have been
able, as far as I have been aided by the Lord, I have treated
throughout, and expounded, this great Psalm,—a task which more able and
learned expositors have performed or will perform better; nevertheless,
my services were not to be withheld from it on that account, when my
brethren earnestly required it of me, to whom I owed this office. That I
have said nothing of the Hebrew alphabet, in which every eight verses
are ranged under a particular letter, and the whole Psalm arranged in
this manner, let no one wonder, since I found nothing that related
especially to the Psalm: for it is not the only one which hath these
letters. Let those who cannot find it in the Latin and Greek versions,
since it is not adopted there, know that every set of eight verses in
the Hebrew copies beginneth with that letter which is prefixed to them;
as is indicated to us by those who are acquainted with the Hebrew
tongue. This is done with much more care than our writers have shown in
their Latin or Punic compositions of Psalms which they style
*abecedarii*. For they do not begin all the verses down to the close of
a period, but the first only with the same letter which they prefix to
it.” It was the counsel of the learned general editor to drop this Psalm
entirely. For the sake of preserving the symmetry of the work, I have
retained as much as I could.—C.\]
