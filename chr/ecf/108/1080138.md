<span id="ii.CXIX.viii-p1"></span> *<span class="c2"><span
id="ii.CXIX.viii-p1.1"></span>Cheth.</span>*

<span id="ii.CXIX.viii-p2"></span>57. Let us hear what followeth: “I
have promised to keep Thy law.” What meaneth, “My portion, O Lord: I
have promised to keep Thy law” ([Psa.
119.57](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#057)<span
id="ii.CXIX.viii-p2.1"></span>); save because the Lord will be each
man’s portion then, when he hath kept His law? Consider therefore what
he subjoineth: “I entreated Thy face, with my whole heart:” and saying
in what manner he prayed: “O be merciful,” he saith, “unto me, according
to Thy word” ([Psa. 119.58](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#058)<span
id="ii.CXIX.viii-p2.2"></span>). And as if he had been heard and aided
by Him whom he prayed unto, “I thought,” he saith, “on mine own ways,
and turned away my feet unto Thy testimonies” ([Psa.
119.59](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#059)<span
id="ii.CXIX.viii-p2.3"></span>). That is, I turned them away from mine
own ways, which displeased me, that they might follow Thy testimonies,
and there might find a path. For most of the copies have not, “Because I
thought,” as is read in some; but only, “I thought.” But what is here
written, “and I turned away my feet:” some read, “Because I thought,
Thou also hast turned away my feet:” that this may rather be ascribed to
the grace of God, according to the Apostle’s words, “For it is God who
worketh in us.” <span id="fr_5211"></span>[5212](#fn_5211) …

<span id="ii.CXIX.viii-p4"></span><span id="page_570">p. 570</span>
<span id="ii.CXIX.viii-Page_570"></span>58. Lastly, when he had received
this blessing of grace, he saith, “I was ready, and was not disturbed,
that I may keep Thy commandments” ([Psa.
119.60](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#060)<span
id="ii.CXIX.viii-p4.1"></span>). Which some have rendered, “to keeping
Thy commandments,” some “that I should keep,” others “to keep,” the
Greek being <span class="Greek"><span id="ii.CXIX.viii-p4.2"></span>τοῦ
φυλ€ξασθαι</span>.

<span id="ii.CXIX.viii-p5"></span>59. But in what manner he was ready to
keep the divine commandments, he hath added, in these words: “The bands
of the ungodly have surrounded me: but I have not forgotten Thy law”
([Psa. 119.61](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#061)<span
id="ii.CXIX.viii-p5.1"></span>). “The bands of the ungodly” are the
hindrances of our enemies, whether spiritual, as the devil and his
angels, or carnal, the children of disobedience, in whom the devil
worketh. <span id="fr_5212"></span>[5213](#fn_5212) For this word
*peccatorum* is not from *peccata,* “sins;” but from *peccatores,*
“sinners.” Therefore when they threaten evils, with which to alarm the
righteous, that they may not suffer for the law of God, they, so to
speak, entangle them with bands, with a strong and tough cord of their
own. For “they draw iniquity like a long rope,” <span
id="fr_5213"></span>[5214](#fn_5213) and thus endeavour to entangle the
holy, and sometimes are allowed so to do.

<span id="ii.CXIX.viii-p8"></span>60. “At midnight,” he saith, “I rise
to give thanks unto Thee: because of Thy righteous judgments” ([Psa.
119.62](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#062)<span
id="ii.CXIX.viii-p8.1"></span>). This very fact, that the bands of the
ungodly surround the righteous, is one of the righteous judgments of
God. On which account the Apostle Peter saith, “The time is come when
judgment must begin at the house of the Lord.” <span
id="fr_5214"></span>[5215](#fn_5214) For he saith this of the
persecutions which the Church suffered, when the bands of the ungodly
surrounded them. I suppose, therefore, that by “midnight” we should
understand the heavier seasons of tribulation. In which he said, “I
arose:” since He did not so afflict him, as to cast him down; but tried
him, so that he arose, that is, that through this very tribulation he
might advance unto a bolder confession.

<span id="ii.CXIX.viii-p10"></span>61. For I imagine that what
followeth, “I am a companion of all them that fear Thee, and keep Thy
commandments” ([Psa. 119.63](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#063)<span
id="ii.CXIX.viii-p10.1"></span>), doth relate to the Head Himself, as it
is in the Epistle which is inscribed to the Hebrews: “Both He that
sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause
He is not ashamed to call them brethren.” <span
id="fr_5215"></span>[5216](#fn_5215) …Therefore Jesus Himself speaketh
in this prophecy: some things in His Members and in the Unity of His
Body, as if in one man diffused over the whole world, and growing up in
succession throughout the roll of ages: and some things in Himself our
Head. And on this account, that since He became the companion of His
brethren, God of men, the Immortal of the mortal, for this reason the
seed fell upon the earth, that by its death it might produce much fruit;
he next addeth concerning this very fruit, “The earth, O Lord, is full
of Thy mercy” ([Psa. 119.64](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#064)<span
id="ii.CXIX.viii-p11.2"></span>). And whence this, save when the ungodly
is justified? That we may make progress in the knowledge of this grace,
he addeth, “O teach me Thy righteousnesses!”
