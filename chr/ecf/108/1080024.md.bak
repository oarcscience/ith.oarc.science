<span id="ii.XX-p1"></span> <span id="ii.XX-p1.1"></span><span
class="c20"><span id="ii.XX-p1.2"></span>Psalm XX. <span
id="fr_566"></span>[567](#fn_566.md) </span>

<span id="ii.XX-p3"></span>To the end, a psalm of David.

<span id="ii.XX-p4"></span>1. This is a well-known title; and it is not
Christ who speaks; but the prophet speaks to Christ, under the form of
wishing, foretelling things to come. <span
id="fr_567"></span>[568](#fn_567.md)

<span id="ii.XX-p6"></span>2. “The Lord hear Thee in the day of trouble”
([Psa. 20.1](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#001.md)<span
id="ii.XX-p6.1"></span>). The Lord hear Thee in the day in which Thou
saidst, “Father glorify Thy Son.” <span
id="fr_568"></span>[569](#fn_568.md) “The name of the God of Jacob protect
Thee.” For to Thee belongeth the younger people. Since “the elder shall
serve the younger.” <span id="fr_569"></span>[570](#fn_569.md)

<span id="ii.XX-p9"></span>3. “Send Thee help from the Holy, and from
Sion defend Thee” ([Psa. 20.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#002.md)<span
id="ii.XX-p9.1"></span>). Making for Thee a sanctified Body, the Church,
from watching <span id="fr_570"></span>[571](#fn_570.md) safe, which
waiteth when Thou shalt come from the wedding.

<span id="ii.XX-p11"></span>4. “Be mindful of all Thy sacrifice” ([Psa.
20.3](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#003)<span id="ii.XX-p11.1"></span>.md).
Make us mindful of all Thy injuries and despiteful treatment, which Thou
hast borne for us. “And be Thy whole burnt offering made fat.” And turn
the cross, whereon Thou wast wholly offered up to God, into the joy of
the resurrection.

<span id="ii.XX-p12"></span>5. “*Diapsalma.*” The Lord render to Thee
according to Thine Heart” ([Psa.
20.4](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#004)<span id="ii.XX-p12.1"></span>.md).
The Lord render to Thee, not according to their heart, who thought by
persecution they could destroy Thee; but according to Thine Heart,
wherein Thou knewest what profit Thy passion would have. <span
id="fr_571"></span>[572](#fn_571.md) “And fulfil all Thy counsel.” “And
fulfil all Thy counsel,” not only that whereby Thou didst lay down Thy
life for Thy friends, <span id="fr_572"></span>[573](#fn_572.md) that the
corrupted grain might rise again to more abundance; <span
id="fr_573"></span>[574](#fn_573.md) but that also whereby “blindness in
part hath happened unto Israel, that the fulness of the Gentiles might
enter in, and so all Israel might be saved.” <span
id="fr_574"></span>[575](#fn_574.md)

<span id="ii.XX-p17"></span>6. “We will exult in Thy salvation” ([Psa.
20.5](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#005)<span id="ii.XX-p17.1"></span>.md).
We will exult in that death will in no wise hurt Thee; for so Thou wilt
also show that it cannot hurt us either. “And in the name of the Lord
our God will we be magnified.” And the confession of Thy name shall not
only not destroy us, but shall even magnify us.

<span id="ii.XX-p18"></span>7. “The Lord fulfil all Thy petitions.” The
Lord fulfil not only the petitions which Thou madest on earth, but those
also whereby Thou intercedest for us in heaven. “Now have I known that
the Lord hath saved his Christ” ([Psa.
20.6](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#006)<span id="ii.XX-p18.1"></span>.md).
Now hath it been shown to me in prophecy, that the Lord will raise up
His Christ again. “He will hear Him from His holy heaven.” He will hear
Him not from earth only, where He prayed to be glorified; <span
id="fr_575"></span>[576](#fn_575.md) but from heaven also, where
interceding for us at the Right Hand of the Father, <span
id="fr_576"></span>[577](#fn_576.md) He hath from thence shed abroad the
Holy Spirit on them that believe on Him. “In strength is the safety of
His right hand.” Our strength is in the safety of His favour, when even
out of tribulation He giveth help, that “when we are weak, then we may
be strong.” <span id="fr_577"></span>[578](#fn_577.md) “For vain is” that
“safety of man,” <span id="fr_578"></span>[579](#fn_578.md) which comes not
of His right hand but of His left: for thereby are they lifted up to
great pride, whosoever in their sins have secured a temporal safety.

<span id="ii.XX-p23"></span>8. “Some in chariots, and some in horses”
([Psa. 20.7](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#007.md)<span
id="ii.XX-p23.1"></span>). Some are drawn away by the ever moving
succession of temporal goods; and some are preferred to proud honours,
and in them exult: “But we will exult in the name of the Lord our God.”
But we, fixing our hope on things eternal, and not seeking our own
glory, will exult in the name of the Lord our God.

<span id="ii.XX-p24"></span>9. “They have been bound, and fallen” ([Psa.
20.8](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#008)<span id="ii.XX-p24.1"></span>.md).
And therefore were they bound by the lust of temporal things, fearing to
spare the <span id="page_57">p. 57</span> <span
id="ii.XX-Page_57"></span>Lord, lest they should lose their place by
“the Romans:” <span id="fr_579"></span>[580](#fn_579.md) and rushing
violently on the stone of offence and rock of stumbling, they fell from
the heavenly hope: to whom the blindness in part of Israel hath
happened, being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and wishing to
establish their own. <span id="fr_580"></span>[581](#fn_580.md) “But we are
risen, and stand upright.” But we, that the Gentile people might enter
in, out of the stones raised up as children to Abraham, <span
id="fr_581"></span>[582](#fn_581.md) who followed not after righteousness,
have attained to it, and are risen; <span
id="fr_582"></span>[583](#fn_582.md) and not by our own strength, but being
justified by faith, we stand upright.

<span id="ii.XX-p29"></span>10. “O Lord, save the King:” that He, who in
His Passion hath shown us an example of conflict, should also offer up
our sacrifices, the Priest raised from the dead, and established in
heaven. “And hear us in the day when we shall call on Thee” ([Psa.
20.9](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#009)<span id="ii.XX-p29.1"></span>.md).
And as He now offereth for us, “hear us in the day when we shall call on
Thee.”
