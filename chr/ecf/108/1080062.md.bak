<span id="ii.LIII-p1"></span> <span id="ii.LIII-p1.1"></span><span
class="c20"><span id="ii.LIII-p1.2"></span>Psalm LIII. <span
id="fr_1924"></span>[1925](#fn_1924.md) </span>

<span id="ii.LIII-p3"></span>1. Of this Psalm we undertake to treat with
you, as far as the Lord supplieth us. A brother biddeth us <span
id="fr_1925"></span>[1926](#fn_1925.md) that we may have the will, and
prayeth that we may have the power. If anything in haste perchance I
shall have passed over, He that even to us deigneth to give what we
shall be enabled to say, will supply it in you. The title of it is: “At
the end, for Maeleth, understanding to David himself.” “For Maeleth,” as
we find in interpretations of Hebrew names, seemeth to say, For one
travailing, or in pain. But who there is in this world that travaileth
and is in pain, the faithful acknowledge, because thereof they are.
Christ here travaileth, Christ here is in pain: the Head is above, the
members below. For one not travailing nor in pain would not say, “Saul,
Saul, why persecutest thou me?” <span
id="fr_1926"></span>[1927](#fn_1926.md) Him, with whom when persecuting He
was travailing, being converted, He made to travail. For he also was
himself afterwards enlightened, and grafted on those members which he
used to persecute; being pregnant with the same love, he said, “My
little children, of whom again I travail, until Christ be formed in
you.” <span id="fr_1927"></span>[1928](#fn_1927.md) For the members
therefore of Christ, for His Body which is the Church, <span
id="fr_1928"></span>[1929](#fn_1928.md) for that same One Man, that is, for
that very unity, whereof the Head is above, this Psalm is sung.…Who are
they, then, amid whom we travail and groan, if in the Body of Christ we
are, if under Him, the Head, we live, if amongst His members we are
counted? Who they are, hear ye.

<span id="ii.LIII-p8"></span>2. “The unwise man hath said in his heart,
There is no God” ([Psa. 53.1](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#001.md)<span
id="ii.LIII-p8.1"></span>). Such sort is it of men amid whom is pained
and groaneth the Body of Christ. If such is this sort of men, of not
many do we travail; as far as seemeth to occur to our thoughts, very few
there are; and a difficult thing it is to meet with a man that saith in
his heart, “There is no God;” <span id="fr_1929"></span>[1930](#fn_1929.md)
nevertheless, so few there are, that, fearing amid the many to say this,
in their heart they say it, for that with mouth to say it they dare not.
Not much then is that which we are bid to endure, hardly is it found:
uncommon is that sort of men that say in their heart, “There is no God.”
But, if it be examined in another sense, is not that found to be in more
men, which we supposed to be in men few and uncommon, and almost in
none? Let them come forth into the midst that live evil lives, let us
look into the doings of profligate, <span id="page_203">p. 203</span>
<span id="ii.LIII-Page_203"></span>daring, and wicked men, of whom there
is a great multitude; who foster day by day their sins, who, their acts
having been changed into habit, have even lost sense of shame: this is
so great a multitude of men, that the Body of Christ, set amid them,
scarce dareth to censure that which it is not constrained to commit, and
deemeth it a great matter for itself that the integrity of innocence be
preserved in not doing that which now, by habit, either it doth not dare
to blame, or if it <span id="fr_1930"></span>[1931](#fn_1930.md) shall have
dared, there breaketh out the censure and recrimination of them that
live evil lives, more readily than the free voice of them that live good
lives. And those men are such as say in their heart, “There is no God.”
Such men I am confuting. Whence confuting? That their doings please God,
they judge. He doth not therefore affirm, “some say,” but “The unwise
man hath said in his heart, There is no God.” Which men do so far
believe there is a God, that the same God they judge with what they do
to be pleased. But if thou being wise dost perceive, how “the unwise man
hath said in his heart, There is no God,” if thou give heed, if thou
understand, if thou examine; he that thinketh that evil doings please
God, Him he doth not think to be God. For if God is, He is just; if He
is just, injustice displeaseth Him, iniquity displeaseth. But thou, when
thou thinkest that iniquity pleaseth Him, dost deny God. For if God is
one Whom iniquity displeaseth, but God seemeth not to thee to be one
whom iniquity displeaseth, and there is no God but one whom iniquity
displeaseth, then when thou sayest in thy heart, God doth countenance my
iniquities, thou sayest nothing else than, “There is no God.”

<span id="ii.LIII-p11"></span>3. Let us advert also to that sense, which
concerning Christ our Lord Himself, our Head Himself, doth present
itself. For when Himself in form of a servant <span
id="fr_1931"></span>[1932](#fn_1931.md) appeared on earth, they that
crucified Him said, “He is not God.” Because Son of God He was, truly
God He was. But they that are corrupted and have become abominable said
what? “He is not God:” let us slay Him, “He is not God.” Thou hast the
voice of these very men in the book of Wisdom. <span
id="fr_1932"></span>[1933](#fn_1932.md) For after there had gone before the
verse, “The unwise man hath said in his heart, There is no God;” as if
reasons were required why the unwise man could say this, he hath
subjoined, “Corrupted they are, and abominable have become in their
iniquities” ([Psa. 53.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#002.md)<span
id="ii.LIII-p13.2"></span>). Hear ye those corrupted men. “For they have
said with themselves, not rightly thinking:” <span
id="fr_1933"></span>[1934](#fn_1933.md) corruption beginneth with evil
belief, thence it proceedeth to depraved morals, thence to the most
flagrant iniquities, these are the grades. But what with themselves said
they, thinking not rightly? “A small thing and with tediousness is our
life.” <span id="fr_1934"></span>[1935](#fn_1934.md) From this evil belief
followeth that which also the Apostle hath spoken of, “Let us eat and
drink, for to-morrow we shall die.” <span
id="fr_1935"></span>[1936](#fn_1935.md) But in the former passage more
diffusely luxury itself is described: “Let us crown us with roses,
before they be withered; in every place let us leave the tokens of our
gladness.” <span id="fr_1936"></span>[1937](#fn_1936.md) After the more
diffuse description of that luxury, what followeth? “Let us slay the
poor just man:” <span id="fr_1937"></span>[1938](#fn_1937.md) this is
therefore saying, “He is not God.” Soft words they seemed but now to
say: “Let us crown us with roses, before they be withered.” What more
delicate, what more soft? Wouldest thou expect, out of this softness,
Crosses, swords? Wonder not, soft are even the roots of brambles; if any
one handle them, he is not pricked: but that wherewith thou shalt be
pricked from thence hath birth. “Corrupted,” therefore, are those men,
“and abominable have become in their iniquities.” They say, “If Son of
God He is, let Him come down from the Cross.” <span
id="fr_1938"></span>[1939](#fn_1938.md) Behold them openly saying, “He is
not God.”…

<span id="ii.LIII-p20"></span>4. “The Lord from Heaven hath looked forth
upon the sons of men, that He might see if there is one understanding
and seeking after God” ([Psa.
53.3](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#003)<span id="ii.LIII-p20.1"></span>.md).
What is this? “Corrupted they are,” all these that say, “There is no
God”? And what? Did it escape God, that they were become such? Or indeed
to us would their inward thought be opened, except by Him it were told?
If then He understood, if then He knew, what is this which hath been
said, “that He might see”? For the words are of one inquiring, of one
not knowing. “God from Heaven hath looked forth,” etc. And as though He
had found what He sought by looking upon, and by looking down from
Heaven, He giveth sentence: “All men have gone aside, together useless
they have become: there is not one that doeth good, not so much as one”
([Psa. 53.4](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#004.md)<span
id="ii.LIII-p20.2"></span>). Two questions arise somewhat difficult: for
if God looketh out from Heaven, in order that He may see if there is one
understanding or seeking after God; there stealeth upon an unwise man
the thought, that God knoweth not all things. This is one question: what
is the other? If there is not one that doeth good, is not so much as
one; who is he that travaileth amid bad men? The former question then is
solved as followeth: ofttimes the Scripture speaketh in such manner,
that what by the gift of God a creature doth, God is said to do.…For
hence has been said the following also, “For the Spirit searcheth all
things, even the depth of God;” <span
id="fr_1939"></span>[1940](#fn_1939.md) not because He that knoweth all
things searcheth, but because to thee hath been given the Spirit, <span
id="page_204">p. 204</span> <span id="ii.LIII-Page_204"></span>which
maketh thee also to search: and that which by His own gift thou doest,
He is said to do; because without Him thou wouldest not do it: therefore
God is said to do, when thou doest.…And because this by the gift of God
thou doest, God from heaven is “looking forth upon the sons of men.” The
former question then, according to our measure, thus hath been solved.

<span id="ii.LIII-p22"></span>5. What is that which looking forth we
acknowledge? What is that which looking forth God acknowledgeth? What
(because here He giveth it) doth He acknowledge? Hear what it is; that
“All have gone aside, together useless they have become: there is not
one that doeth good, there is not so much as one.” What then is that
other question, but the same whereof a little before I have made
mention? If, “There is not one that doeth good, is not so much as one,”
no one remaineth to groan amid evil men. Stay, saith the Lord, do not
hastily give judgment. I have given to men to do well; but of Me, He
saith, not of themselves: for of themselves evil they are: sons of men
they are, when they do evil; when well, My sons. For this thing God
doth, out of sons of men He maketh sons of God: because out of Son of
God He hath made Son of Man. See what this participation is: there hath
been promised to us a participation of Divinity: He lieth that hath
promised, if He is not first made partaker of mortality. For the Son of
God hath been made partaker of mortality, in order that mortal man may
be made partaker of divinity. He that hath promised that His good is to
be shared with thee, first with thee hath shared thy evil: He that to
thee hath promised divinity, showeth in thee love. Therefore take away
that men are sons of God, there remaineth that they are sons of men:
“There is none that doeth good, is not so much as one.”

<span id="ii.LIII-p23"></span>6. “Shall not all know that work iniquity,
that devour My people for the food of bread”? ([Psa.
53.5](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#005.md)<span
id="ii.LIII-p23.1"></span>).…There is therefore here a people of God
that is being devoured. Nay, “There is not one that doeth good, there is
not so much as one.” We reply by the rule above. But this people that is
devoured, this people that suffereth evil men, this that groaneth and
travaileth amid evil men, now out of sons of men have been made sons of
God: therefore are they devoured. For, “The counsel of the needy man
thou hast confounded, because the Lord is his hope.” <span
id="fr_1940"></span>[1941](#fn_1940.md) For ofttimes, in order that the
people of God may be devoured, this very thing in it is despised, that
it is the people of God. I will pillage, he saith, and despoil; if he is
a Christian, what will he do to me?…But what followeth? “I will convince
thee, and will set thee before thy face.” Thou wilt not now know so as
thou shouldest be displeasing to thyself, thou shalt know so as thou
mayest mourn. For God cannot but show to the unrighteous their iniquity.
If He is not to show, who will they be that are to say, “What hath
profited us pride, and what hath boasting of riches bestowed upon
us?” <span id="fr_1941"></span>[1942](#fn_1941.md) For then shall they
know, that now will not know. “Shall not all know?” etc. Why hath He
added, “for the food of bread”? As it were as bread, they eat My people.
For all other things which we eat, we can eat now these, now those; not
always this vegetable, not always this flesh, not always these apples:
but always bread. What is then, “Devour My people for the food of
bread”? Without intermission, without cessation they devour.

<span id="ii.LIII-p26"></span>7. “On God they have not called.” He is
comforting the man that groaneth, and chiefly by an admonition, lest by
imitating evil men, who ofttimes prosper, they delight in evil doing.
There is kept for thee that which to thee hath been promised: their hope
is present, thine is future, but theirs is transient, thine sure; theirs
false, thine true. For they “upon God have not called.” Do not daily
such men ask of God? They do “not” ask of God. Give heed, if I am able
to say this by the aid of God Himself. God gratuitously will have
Himself to be worshipped, gratuitously will have Himself to be loved,
that is chastely to be loved; not Himself to be loved for the reason
that He giveth anything besides Himself, but because He giveth Himself.
He then that calleth upon God in order that He may be made rich, on God
doth not call: for upon that He calleth which to himself he willeth to
come.…But now thou wouldest have coffer full, and conscience void: God
filleth not coffer, but breast. What do outward riches profit thee, if
inward need presseth thee? Therefore those men that for the sake of
worldly comforts, that for the sake of earthly good things, that for the
sake of present life and earthly felicity, call upon God, do not call
upon God.

<span id="ii.LIII-p27"></span>8. For this reason what followeth
concerning them? “There have they feared with fear, where there was no
fear” ([Psa. 53.6](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#006.md)<span
id="ii.LIII-p27.1"></span>). For is there fear, if a man lose riches?
There is no fear there, and yet in that case men are afraid. But if a
man lose wisdom, truly there is fear, and in that case he is not
afraid.…Thou hast feared to give back money, and hast willed to lose
fidelity. The Martyrs took not away property of other persons, but even
their own they despised that they might not lose fidelity: and it was
too little to lose money, when they were <span id="page_205">p.
205</span> <span id="ii.LIII-Page_205"></span>proscribed; they took also
their life when they suffered: they lost life, in order that unto
everlasting life they might find it. <span
id="fr_1942"></span>[1943](#fn_1942.md) Therefore there they feared, where
they ought to have been afraid. But they that of Christ have said, “He
is not God,” have there feared where was no fear. For they said, “If we
shall have let Him go, there will come the Romans, and will take away
from us both place and kingdom.” <span
id="fr_1943"></span>[1944](#fn_1943.md) O folly and imprudence saying in
its heart, “He is not God”! Thou hast feared to lose earth, thou hast
lost Heaven: thou hast feared lest there should come the Romans, and
take away from thee place and kingdom! Could they take away from thee
God? What then remaineth? what but that thou confess, that thou hast
willed to keep, and by keeping ill hast lost? For thou hast lost both
place and nation by slaying Christ. For ye did will rather to slay
Christ, than to lose place; and ye have lost place, and nation, and
Christ. In fearing, they have slain Christ: but wherefore this? “For God
hath scattered the bones of them that please men.” <span
id="fr_1944"></span>[1945](#fn_1944.md) Willing to please men, they feared
to lose their place. But Christ Himself, of whom they said, “He is not
God,” willed rather to displease such men, as they were: sons of men,
not sons of God, He willed rather to displease. Thence were scattered
their bones, His bones no one hath broken. “They were confounded, for
God hath despised them.” In very deed, brethren, as far as regardeth
them, great confusion hath come to them. In the place where they
crucified the Lord, whom for this cause they crucified, that they might
not lose both place and nation, the Jews are not. “God,” therefore,
“hath despised them:” and yet in despising He warned them to be
converted. Let them now confess Christ, and say, He is God, of whom they
said, “He is not God.” Let them return to the inheritance of their
fathers, to the inheritance of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, let them
possess with these very persons life eternal: though they have lost life
temporal. Wherefore this? Because out of sons of men have been made sons
of God. For so long as they remain, and will not, there is not one that
doeth good, there is not so much as one. “They were confounded, for God
hath despised them.” And as though to these very persons He were turned,
He saith, “Who shall give out of Sion salvation to Israel?” ([Psa.
53.7](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#007)<span id="ii.LIII-p30.1"></span>.md).
O ye fools, ye revile, insult, buffet, besmear with spittings, with
thorns ye crown, upon the Cross ye lift up; whom? “Who shall give out of
Sion salvation to Israel?” Shall not That Same of whom ye have said, “He
is not God”? “In God’s turning away the captivity of His people.” For
there turneth away the captivity of His people, no one but He that hath
willed to be a captive in your own hands. But what men shall understand
this thing? “Jacob shall exult, and Israel shall rejoice.” “Israel;” the
true Jacob, and the true Israel, that younger, to whom the elder was
servant,  <span id="fr_1945"></span>[1946](#fn_1945.md) shall himself
exult, for he shall himself understand.
