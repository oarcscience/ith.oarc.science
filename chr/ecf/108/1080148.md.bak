<span id="ii.CXIX.xviii"></span>

<span id="ii.CXIX.xviii-p1"></span> *<span class="c2"><span
id="ii.CXIX.xviii-p1.1"></span>Tadze.</span>*

<span id="ii.CXIX.xviii-p2"></span>136. Thus, then, as if giving a
reason why he had cause to weep much, and to mourn deeply for his sin,
he saith, “Righteous art Thou, O Lord, and true is Thy judgment” ([Psa.
119.137](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#137.md)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xviii-p2.1"></span>). “Thou hast commanded Thy testimonies,
righteousness, and Thy truth exceedingly” ([Psa.
119.138](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#138.md)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xviii-p2.2"></span>). This righteousness of God and
righteous judgment and truth, is to be feared by every sinner: for
thereby all who are condemned are condemned of God; nor is there one who
can righteously complain against the righteous God of his own damnation.
Therefore the tears of the penitent are needful; since if his impenitent
heart were condemned, he would be most justly condemned. He indeed
calleth the testimonies of God righteousness: for He proveth himself
righteous by giving righteous commandments. And this is truth also, that
God may become known by such testimonies.

<span id="ii.CXIX.xviii-p3"></span>137. But what is it that followeth:
“My zeal hath caused me to pine” ([Psa.
119.139](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#139.md)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xviii-p3.1"></span>); or, as other copies read, Thy zeal?
Others have also, “The zeal of Thy house:” and, “hath eaten me up,”
instead of, “hath caused me to pine.” This, as it seems to me, has been
considered as an emendation to be introduced from another Psalm, where
it is written, “The zeal of Thy house hath eaten me up:”  <span
id="fr_5331"></span>[5332](#fn_5331.md) a text quoted also, as we know, in
the Gospel. The two words, however, “hath caused me to pine,” and “hath
eaten me up,” are somewhat like. But the words, “my zeal,” which most of
the copies read, occasion no dispute: for what wonder is it if every man
pineth away from his own zeal? The words read in other copies, “Thy
zeal,” signify a man zealous for God, not for himself: but there is no
difficulty in using “my” in the same sense…The Psalmist’s jealousy is
therefore also to be understood in a good sense: for he addeth the
cause, and saith, “Because mine enemies have forgotten Thy words.”…

<span id="ii.CXIX.xviii-p5"></span>138. Then considering with himself
with what a flame of love he burned for the commandments of God:
“Fiery,” saith he, “is Thy word exceedingly, and Thy servant hath loved
it” ([Psa. 119.140](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#140.md)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xviii-p5.1"></span>). Justly jealous was he of the
impenitent heart in His enemies, who had forgotten God’s word; for he
endeavoured to bring them unto that which he himself most ardently
loved.

<span id="ii.CXIX.xviii-p6"></span>139. “I am young, and of no
reputation; yet do I not forget Thy righteousnesses:” not as my enemies,
who “have forgotten Thy words” ([Psa.
119.141](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#141.md)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xviii-p6.1"></span>). The younger seems to grieve for those
older than himself who had forgotten the righteousnesses of God, while
he himself had not forgotten. For what meaneth, “I am young, yet do I
not forget”? save this, Those older than me have forgotten. For the
Greek word is <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.CXIX.xviii-p6.2"></span>νεώτερος</span>, the same as that used in
the words above, “Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way?” <span
id="fr_5332"></span>[5333](#fn_5332.md) This is a comparative, and is
therefore well understood in its relation to some one older. Let us
therefore here recognize the two nations, who were striving even in
Rebecca’s womb; when it was said to her, not from works, but of Him that
calleth, “The elder shall serve the younger.” <span
id="fr_5333"></span>[5334](#fn_5333.md) But the younger saith here that he
is of no reputation: for this reason he hath become greater: since
“behold, they that were first are last, and they that were last
first.” <span id="fr_5334"></span>[5335](#fn_5334.md)

<span id="ii.CXIX.xviii-p10"></span>140. It is no wonder that they have
forgotten the words of God, who have chosen to set up their own
righteousness, ignorant of the righteousness of God; <span
id="fr_5335"></span>[5336](#fn_5335.md) but he, the younger, hath not <span
id="page_584">p. 584</span> <span
id="ii.CXIX.xviii-Page_584"></span>forgotten, for he hath not wished to
have a righteousness of his own, but that of God, of which he now also
saith, “Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and Thy law
is the truth” ([Psa. 119.142](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#142.md)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xviii-p11.2"></span>). For how is not the law truth, through
which came the knowledge of sin, and that which giveth testimony of the
righteousness of God? For thus the Apostle saith: “The righteousness of
God is manifested, being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets.” <span
id="fr_5336"></span>[5337](#fn_5336.md)

<span id="ii.CXIX.xviii-p13"></span>141. On account of this law the
younger suffered persecution from the elder, so that the younger saith
what followeth: “Trouble and hardship have taken hold upon me: yet is my
meditation in Thy commandments” ([Psa.
119.143](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#143.md)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xviii-p13.1"></span>). Let them rage, let them persecute; as
long as the commandments of God be not abandoned, and, after those
commandments, let even those who rage be loved.

<span id="ii.CXIX.xviii-p14"></span>142. “Thy testimonies are
righteousness unto everlasting: O grant me understanding, and I shall
live” ([Psa. 119.144](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#144.md)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xviii-p14.1"></span>). This younger one prayeth for
understanding; which if he had not, he would not be “wiser than the
aged;” <span id="fr_5337"></span>[5338](#fn_5337.md) but he prayeth for it
in trouble and hardships, that he may thereby understand how
contemptible is all that his persecuting enemies can take from him, by
whom he saith he hath been despised. Therefore he hath said, “and I
shall live:” because if trouble and heaviness reached such a pitch, that
his life should be terminated by the hands of his persecuting enemies,
he will live for ever, who preferreth to temporal things, righteousness
which remaineth for evermore. This righteousness in trouble and hardship
are the *Martyria Dei,* that is, the testimonies of God, for which
Martyrs have been crowned.
