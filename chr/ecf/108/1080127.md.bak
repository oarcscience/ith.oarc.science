<span id="ii.CXVI-p1"></span> <span id="ii.CXVI-p1.1"></span><span
class="c20"><span id="ii.CXVI-p1.2"></span>Psalm CXVI. <span
id="fr_5075"></span>[5076](#fn_5075.md) </span>

<span id="ii.CXVI-p3"></span>1. “I have loved, since the Lord will hear
the voice of my prayer” ([Psa.
116.1](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#001)<span id="ii.CXVI-p3.1"></span>.md).
Let the soul that is sojourning in absence from the Lord sing thus, let
that sheep which had strayed sing thus, let that son who had “died and
returned to life,” who had “been lost and was found;” <span
id="fr_5076"></span>[5077](#fn_5076.md) let our soul sing thus, brethren,
and most beloved sons. Let us be taught, and let us abide, and let us
sing thus with the Saints: “I have loved: since the Lord will hear the
voice of my prayer.” Is this a reason for having loved, that the Lord
will hear the voice of my prayer? and do we not rather love, because He
hath heard, or that He may hear? What then meaneth, “I have loved, since
the Lord will hear”? Doth he, because hope is wont to inflame love, say
that he hath loved, since he hath hoped that God will listen to the
voice of his prayer?

<span id="ii.CXVI-p5"></span>2. But whence hath he hoped for this?
Since, he saith, “He hath inclined His ear unto me: and in my days I
have called upon Him” ([Psa.
116.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#002)<span id="ii.CXVI-p5.1"></span>.md).
I loved, therefore, because He will hear; He will hear, “because He hath
inclined His ear unto me.” But whence knowest thou, O human soul, that
God hath inclined His ear unto thee, except thou sayest, “I have
believed”? These three things, therefore, “abide, faith, hope,
charity:” <span id="fr_5077"></span>[5078](#fn_5077.md) because thou hast
believed, thou hast hoped; because thou hast hoped, thou hast loved.…

<span id="ii.CXVI-p7"></span>3. And what are thy days, since thou hast
said, “In my days I have called upon Him”? Are they those perchance, in
which “the fulness of time came,” and “God sent His Son,” <span
id="fr_5078"></span>[5079](#fn_5078.md) who had already said, “In an
acceptable time have I heard thee, and in a day of salvation have I
helped thee”? <span id="fr_5079"></span>[5080](#fn_5079.md) …I may rather
call my days the days of my misery, the days of my mortality, the days
according to Adam, full of toil and sweat, the days according to the
ancient corruption. “For I lying, stuck fast in the deep mire,” <span
id="fr_5080"></span>[5081](#fn_5080.md) in another Psalm also have cried
out, “Behold, Thou hast made my days old;” <span
id="fr_5081"></span>[5082](#fn_5081.md) in these days of mine have I called
upon Thee. For my days are different from the days of my Lord. I call
those my days, which by my own daring I have made for myself, whereby I
have forsaken Him: and, since He reigneth everywhere, and is
all-powerful, and holdeth all things, I have deserved prison; that is, I
have received the darkness of ignorance, and the bonds of mortality.…For
in these days of mine, “The snares of death compassed me round about,
and the pains of hell gat hold upon me” ([Psa.
116.3](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#003.md)<span
id="ii.CXVI-p11.2"></span>): pains that would not have overtaken me, had
I not wandered from Thee. But now they have overtaken me; but I found
them not, while I was rejoicing in the prosperity of the world, in which
the snares of hell deceive the more.

<span id="ii.CXVI-p12"></span>4. But after “I too found trouble and
heaviness, I called upon the Name of the Lord” ([Psa.
116.4](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#004.md)<span
id="ii.CXVI-p12.1"></span>). For trouble and profitable sorrow I did not
feel; trouble, wherein He giveth aid, unto whom it is said, “O be Thou
our help in trouble: and vain is the help of man.” <span
id="fr_5082"></span>[5083](#fn_5082.md) For I thought I might rejoice and
exult in the vain help of man; but when I had heard from my Lord,
“Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted:” <span
id="fr_5083"></span>[5084](#fn_5083.md) I did not wait until I should lose
those temporal blessings in which I rejoiced, and should then mourn: but
I gave heed to that very misery of mine which caused me to rejoice in
such things, which I both feared to lose, and yet could not retain; I
gave heed to it firmly and courageously, and I saw that I was not only
agonized by the adversities of this world, but even bound by its good
fortune; and thus “I found the trouble and heaviness” which had escaped
me, “and called upon the Name of the Lord; O Lord, I beseech Thee,
deliver my <span id="page_555">p. 555</span> <span
id="ii.CXVI-Page_555"></span>soul.” Let then the holy people of God say,
“I called upon the Name of the Lord:” and let the remainder of the
heathen hear, who do not as yet call upon the Name of the Lord; let them
hear and seek, that they may discover trouble and heaviness, and may
call upon the Name of the Lord, and be saved.…

<span id="ii.CXVI-p15"></span>5. “Gracious is the Lord, and righteous;
yea, our God is merciful” ([Psa.
116.5](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#005.md)<span
id="ii.CXVI-p15.1"></span>). He is gracious, righteous, and merciful.
Gracious in the first place, because He hath inclined His ear unto me;
and I knew not that the ear of God had approached my lips, till I was
aroused by those beautiful feet, that I might call upon the Lord’s Name:
for who hath called upon Him, save he whom He first called? Hence
therefore He is in the first place “gracious;” but “righteous,” because
He scourgeth; and again, “merciful,” because He receiveth; for “He
scourgeth every son whom He receiveth;” nor ought it to be so bitter to
me that He scourgeth, as sweet that He receiveth. For how should not
“The Lord, who keepeth little ones” ([Psa.
116.6](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#006.md)<span
id="ii.CXVI-p15.2"></span>), scourge those whom, when of mature age, He
seeketh to be heirs; “for what son is he whom the father chasteneth
not?”  <span id="fr_5084"></span>[5085](#fn_5084.md) “I was in misery, and
He helped me.” He helped me, because I was in misery; for the pain which
the physician causeth by his knife is not penal, but salutary.

<span id="ii.CXVI-p17"></span>6. “Turn again then unto thy rest, O my
soul; for the Lord hath done good to thee” ([Psa.
116.7](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#007.md)<span
id="ii.CXVI-p17.1"></span>): not for thy deservings, or through thy
strength; but because the Lord hath done good to thee. “Since,” he
saith, “He hath delivered my soul from death” ([Psa.
116.8](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#008.md)<span
id="ii.CXVI-p17.2"></span>). It is wonderful, most beloved brethren,
that, after he had said that his soul should turn unto rest, since the
Lord had rewarded him; he added, since “He hath delivered my soul from
death.” Did it turn unto rest, because it was delivered from death? Is
not rest more usually said of death? What is the action of him whose
life is rest, and death disquietude? Such then ought to be the action of
the soul, as may tend to a quiet security, not one that may increase
restless toil; since He hath delivered it from death, who, pitying it,
said, “Come unto Me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will
give you rest,” etc. <span id="fr_5085"></span>[5086](#fn_5085.md) Meek
therefore and humble, following, so to speak, Christ as its path, should
the action of the soul be that tendeth towards repose; nevertheless, not
slothful and supine; that it may finish its course, as it is written,
“In quietness make perfect thy works.” <span
id="fr_5086"></span>[5087](#fn_5086.md) “Thou hast delivered my soul from
death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling.” Whoever feeleth
the chain of this flesh, chanteth these things as fulfilled in hope
towards himself. For it is truly said, “I was in misery, and He
delivered me;” but the Apostle saith this also truly, that we are saved
by hope. <span id="fr_5087"></span>[5088](#fn_5087.md) And that we are
delivered from death, is well said to be already fulfilled, so that we
may understand the death of unbelievers, of whom he saith, “Leave the
dead to bury their dead.” <span id="fr_5088"></span>[5089](#fn_5088.md) …He
will then clear our eyes of tears, when He shall save our feet from
falling. For there will then be no slipping of our feet as they walk,
when there will be no sliding of the weak flesh. But now, however firm
our path, which is Christ, be; yet since we place flesh, which we are
enjoined to subdue, beneath us; in the very work of chastening and
subduing it, it is a great thing not to fall: but not to slip in the
flesh, who can attain? “I shall please in the sight of the Lord, in the
land of the living” ([Psa. 116.9](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#009.md)<span
id="ii.CXVI-p21.2"></span>).…We “labour” indeed now, because we are
awaiting “the redemption of our body:” <span
id="fr_5089"></span>[5090](#fn_5089.md) but, “when death shall have been
swallowed up in victory, and this corruptible shall have put on
incorruption, and this mortal immortality;” <span
id="fr_5090"></span>[5091](#fn_5090.md) then there will be no weeping,
because there will be no falling; and no falling, because no corruption.
And therefore we shall then no longer labour to please, but we shall be
entirely pleasing in the sight of the Lord, in the land of the living.

<span id="ii.CXVI-p24"></span>7. …“I believed,” saith he, “and therefore
did I speak. But I was sorely brought down” ([Psa.
116.10](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#010.md)<span
id="ii.CXVI-p24.1"></span>). For he suffered many tribulations, for the
sake of the word which he faithfully held, faithfully preached; and he
was sorely brought down; as they feared who loved the praise of men
better than that of God. But what meaneth, “But I”? He should rather
say, I believed, and therefore I have spoken, and I was sorely brought
down: why did he add, “But I,” save because a man may be sorely brought
down by those who oppose the truth, the truth itself cannot, which he
believeth and speaketh? Whence also the Apostle, when he was speaking of
his chain, saith, “the word of God is not bound.” <span
id="fr_5091"></span>[5092](#fn_5091.md) So this man also, since there is
one person of the holy witnesses, that is, of the Martyrs of God, saith,
“I believed, and therefore will I speak.” “But I;” not that which I
believed, not the word which I have delivered; “but I was sorely brought
down.”

<span id="ii.CXVI-p26"></span>8. “I said in my trance, All men are
liars” ([Psa. 116.11](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#011.md)<span
id="ii.CXVI-p26.1"></span>). By trance he meaneth fear, which when
persecutors threaten, and when the sufferings of torture or death
impend, human weakness suffereth. For this we understand, because in
this Psalm the voice of Martyrs is heard. For trance is used in another
sense also, when the mind is not beside itself by fear, but is possessed
by some inspiration of revelation. “But I said <span id="page_556">p.
556</span> <span id="ii.CXVI-Page_556"></span>in my haste, All men are
liars.” In consternation he hath had regard to his infirmity, and hath
seen that he ought not to presume on himself; for as far as pertaineth
to the man himself, he is a liar, but by the grace of God he is made
true; lest yielding to the pressure of his enemies he might not speak
what he had believed, but might deny it; even as it happened to Peter,
since he had trusted in himself, and was to be taught that we ought not
to trust in man. And if every one ought not to trust in man, surely not
in himself; because he is a man. Rightly therefore in his fear did he
perceive that every man was a liar; since they also whom no fear robs of
their presence of mind, so that they never lie by yielding to the
persecutors, are such by the gifts of God, not by their own strength.…

<span id="ii.CXVI-p27"></span>9. “What,” he asketh, “what reward shall I
give unto the Lord, for all the benefits that He hath returned unto me?”
([Psa. 116.12](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#012.md)<span
id="ii.CXVI-p27.1"></span>). He saith not, for all the benefits that He
hath done unto me but “for all the benefits that He hath returned unto
me.” What deeds then on the man’s part had preceded, that all the
benefits of God were not said to be given, but returned? What had
preceded, on the man’s part, save sins? God therefore repayeth good for
evil, whilst unto Him men repay evil for good; for such was the return
of those who said, “This is the heir: come, let us kill him.”  <span
id="fr_5092"></span>[5093](#fn_5092.md)

<span id="ii.CXVI-p29"></span>10. But this man seeketh what he may
return unto the Lord, and findeth not, save out of those things which
the Lord Himself returneth. “I will receive,” he saith, “the cup of
salvation, and call upon the Name of the Lord” ([Psa.
116.13](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#013.md)<span
id="ii.CXVI-p29.1"></span>). “My vows will I render to the Lord, before
all His people” ([Psa. 116.14](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#014.md)<span
id="ii.CXVI-p29.2"></span>). Who hath given thee the cup of salvation,
which when thou takest, and callest upon the Name of the Lord, thou
shalt return unto Him a reward for all that He hath returned unto thee?
Who, save He who saith, “Are ye able to drink the cup that I shall drink
of?” <span id="fr_5093"></span>[5094](#fn_5093.md) Who hath given unto thee
to imitate His sufferings, save He who hath suffered before for thee?
And therefore, “Right dear in the sight of the Lord is the death of His
Saints” ([Psa. 116.15](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#015.md)<span
id="ii.CXVI-p30.2"></span>). He purchased it by His Blood, which He
first shed for the salvation of slaves, that they might not hesitate to
shed their blood for the Lord’s Name; which, nevertheless, would be
profitable for their own interests, not for those of the Lord.

<span id="ii.CXVI-p31"></span>11. Let therefore the slave purchased at
so great a price confess his condition, and say, “Behold, O Lord, how
that I am Thy servant: “I am Thy servant, and the son of Thine handmaid”
([Psa. 116.16](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#016.md)<span
id="ii.CXVI-p31.1"></span>).…This, therefore, is the son of the heavenly
Jerusalem, which is above, the free mother of us all. <span
id="fr_5094"></span>[5095](#fn_5094.md) And free indeed from sin she is,
but the handmaid of righteousness; to whose sons still pilgrims it is
said, “Ye have been called unto liberty;” <span
id="fr_5095"></span>[5096](#fn_5095.md) and again he maketh them servants,
when he saith, “but by love serve one another.”…Let therefore that
servant say unto God, Many call themselves martyrs, many Thy servants,
because they hold Thy Name in various heresies and errors; but since
they are beside Thy Church, they are not the children of Thy handmaid.
But “I am Thy servant, and the son of Thine handmaid.” “Thou hast broken
my bonds asunder.”

<span id="ii.CXVI-p34"></span>12. “I will offer to Thee the sacrifice of
praise” ([Psa. 116.17](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#017.md)<span
id="ii.CXVI-p34.1"></span>). For I have not found any deserts of mine,
since Thou hast broken my bonds asunder; I therefore owe Thee the
sacrifice of praise; because, although I will boast that I am Thy
servant, and the son of Thy handmaid, I will glory not in myself, but in
Thee, my Lord, who hast broken asunder my bonds, that when I return from
my desertion, I may again be bound unto Thee.

<span id="ii.CXVI-p35"></span>13. “I will pay my vows unto the Lord”
([Psa. 116.18](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#018.md)<span
id="ii.CXVI-p35.1"></span>). What vows wilt thou pay? What victims hast
thou vowed? what burnt-offerings, what holocausts? Dost thou refer to
what thou hast said a little before, “I will receive the cup of
salvation, and will call upon the Name of the Lord;” and, “I will offer
to Thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving”? and indeed whosoever well
considereth what he is vowing to the Lord, and what vows he is paying,
let him vow himself, let him pay himself as a vow: this is exacted, this
is due. On looking at the coin, the Lord saith, “Render unto Cæsar the
things which are Cæsar’s, and unto God the things which are
God’s:” <span id="fr_5096"></span>[5097](#fn_5096.md) his own image is
rendered unto Cæsar: let His image be rendered unto God.

<span id="ii.CXVI-p37"></span>14. “In the courts,” he saith, “of the
Lord’s house” ([Psa. 116.19](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#019.md)<span
id="ii.CXVI-p37.1"></span>). What is the Lord’s house, the same is the
Lord’s handmaid: and what is God’s house, save all His people? It
therefore followeth, “In the sight of all His people.” And now he more
openly nameth his mother herself. For what else is His people, but what
followeth, “In the midst of thee, O Jerusalem”? For than that which is
returned grateful, if it be returned from peace, and in peace. But they
who are not sons of this handmaid, have loved war rather than peace.…
