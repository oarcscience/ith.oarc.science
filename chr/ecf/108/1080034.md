<span id="ii.XXX-p1"></span> <span id="ii.XXX-p1.1"></span><span
class="c20"><span id="ii.XXX-p1.2"></span>Psalm XXX. <span
id="fr_676"></span>[677](#fn_676.md) </span>

<span id="ii.XXX-p3"></span>*To the end, the psalm of the
canticle* <span id="fr_677"></span>[678](#fn_677.md) *of the dedication of
the house, of David himself.*

<span id="ii.XXX-p5"></span>1. To the end, a Psalm of the joy of the
Resurrection, and the change, the renewing of the body to an immortal
state, and not only of the Lord, but also of the whole Church. For in
the former Psalm the tabernacle was finished, wherein we dwell in the
time of war: but now the house is dedicated, which will abide in peace
everlasting.

<span id="ii.XXX-p6"></span>2. It is then whole Christ who speaketh. “I
will exalt Thee, O Lord, for Thou hast taken Me up” ([Psa.
30.1](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#001)<span id="ii.XXX-p6.1"></span>.md). I
will praise Thy high Majesty, O Lord, for Thou hast taken Me up. “Thou
hast not made Mine enemies to rejoice over Me.” And those, who have so
often endeavoured to oppress Me with various persecutions throughout the
world, Thou hast not made to rejoice over Me.

<span id="ii.XXX-p7"></span>3. “O Lord, My God, I have cried unto Thee,
and Thou hast healed Me” ([Psa.
30.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#002)<span id="ii.XXX-p7.1"></span>.md). O
Lord, My God, I have cried unto Thee, and I no longer bear about a body
enfeebled and sick by mortality.

<span id="ii.XXX-p8"></span>4. “O Lord, Thou hast brought back My Soul
from hell, and Thou hast saved Me from them that go down into the pit”
([Psa. 30.3](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#003.md)<span
id="ii.XXX-p8.1"></span>). Thou hast saved Me from the condition of
profound darkness, and the lowest slough of corruptible flesh.

<span id="ii.XXX-p9"></span>5. “Sing to the Lord, O ye saints of His.”
The prophet seeing these future things, rejoiceth, and saith, “Sing to
the Lord, O ye saints of His. And make confession of the remembrance of
His holiness” ([Psa. 30.4](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#004.md)<span
id="ii.XXX-p9.1"></span>). And make confession to Him, that He hath not
forgotten the sanctification, wherewith He hath sanctified you, although
all this intermediate period belong to your desires.

<span id="ii.XXX-p10"></span>6. “For in His indignation is wrath” ([Psa.
30.5](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#005)<span id="ii.XXX-p10.1"></span>.md).
<span id="page_68">p. 68</span> <span id="ii.XXX-Page_68"></span>For He
hath avenged against you the first sin, for which you have paid by
death. “And life in His will.” And life eternal, whereunto you could not
return by any strength of your own, hath He given, because He so would.
“In the evening weeping will tarry.” Evening began, when the light of
wisdom withdrew from sinful man, when he was condemned to death: from
this evening weeping will tarry, as long as God’s people are, amid
labours and temptations, awaiting the day of the Lord. “And exultation
in the morning.” Even to the morning, when there will be the exultation
of the resurrection, which hath shone forth by anticipation in the
morning resurrection of the Lord.

<span id="ii.XXX-p11"></span>7. “But I said in my abundance, I shall not
be moved for ever” ([Psa. 30.6](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#006.md)<span
id="ii.XXX-p11.1"></span>). But I, that people which was speaking from
the first, said in mine abundance, suffering now no more any want, “I
shall not be moved for ever.”

<span id="ii.XXX-p12"></span>8. “O Lord, in Thy will Thou hast afforded
strength unto my beauty” ([Psa.
30.7](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#007)<span id="ii.XXX-p12.1"></span>.md).
But that this my abundance, O Lord, is not of myself, but that in Thy
will Thou hast afforded strength unto my beauty, I have learnt from
this, “Thou turnedst away Thy Face from me, and I became troubled;” for
Thou hast sometimes turned away Thy Face from the sinner, and I became
troubled, when the illumination of Thy knowledge withdrew from me.

<span id="ii.XXX-p13"></span>9. “Unto Thee, O Lord, will I cry, and unto
my God will I pray” ([Psa. 30.8](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#008.md)<span
id="ii.XXX-p13.1"></span>). And bringing to mind that time of my trouble
and misery, and as it were established therein, I hear the voice of Thy
First-Begotten, my Head, about to die for me, and saying “Unto Thee, O
Lord, will I cry, and unto My God will I pray.”

<span id="ii.XXX-p14"></span>10. “What profit” is there in the shedding
of My blood, whilst I go down to corruption? “Shall dust confess unto
Thee?” For if I shall not rise immediately, and My body shall become
corrupt, “shall dust confess unto Thee?” that is, the crowd of the
ungodly, whom I shall justify by My resurrection? “Or declare Thy
truth?” Or for the salvation of the rest declare Thy truth?

<span id="ii.XXX-p15"></span>11. “The Lord hath heard, and had mercy on
Me, the Lord hath become My helper.” Nor did “He suffer His holy One to
see corruption” <span id="fr_678"></span>[679](#fn_678.md) ([Psa.
30.10](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#010)<span id="ii.XXX-p16.2"></span>.md).

<span id="ii.XXX-p17"></span>12. “Thou hast turned My mourning into joy
to Me” ([Psa. 30.11](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#011.md)<span
id="ii.XXX-p17.1"></span>). Whom I, the Church, having received, the
First-Begotten from the dead, <span id="fr_679"></span>[680](#fn_679.md)
now in the dedication of Thine house, say, “Thou hast turned my mourning
into joy to me. Thou hast put off my sackcloth, and girded me with
gladness.” Thou hast torn off the veil of my sins, the sadness of my
mortality; and hast girded me with the first robe, with immortal
gladness.

<span id="ii.XXX-p19"></span>13. “That my glory should sing unto Thee,
and I should not be pricked” ([Psa.
30.12](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#012)<span id="ii.XXX-p19.1"></span>.md).
That now, not my humiliation, but my glory should not lament, but should
sing unto Thee, for that now out of humiliation Thou hast exalted me;
and that I should not be pricked with the consciousness of sin, with the
fear of death, with the fear of judgment. “O Lord, my God, I will
confess unto Thee for ever.” And this is my glory, O Lord, my God, that
I should confess unto Thee for ever, that I have nothing of myself, but
that all my good is of Thee, who art “God, All in all.” <span
