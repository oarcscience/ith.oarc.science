<span id="ii.CXXXI-p1"></span> <span id="ii.CXXXI-p1.1"></span><span
class="c20"><span id="ii.CXXXI-p1.2"></span>Psalm CXXXI. <span
id="fr_5574"></span>[5575](#fn_5574.md) </span>

<span id="ii.CXXXI-p3"></span>1. In this Psalm, the humility of one that
is a servant of God and faithful is commended unto us, by whose voice it
is sung; which is the whole body of Christ. <span
id="fr_5575"></span>[5576](#fn_5575.md) For we have often warned you,
beloved, that it ought not to be received as the voice of one man
singing, but of all who are in Christ’s Body. And since all are in His
Body, as it were one man speaketh: and he is one who also is many.…Now
he prayeth in the temple of God, who prayeth in the peace of the Church,
in the unity of Christ’s Body; which Body of Christ consisteth of many
who believe in the whole world: and therefore he who prayeth in the
temple, is heard. For he prayeth in the spirit and in truth, <span
id="fr_5576"></span>[5577](#fn_5576.md) who prayeth in the peace of the
Church; not in that temple, wherein was the figure.…

<span id="ii.CXXXI-p6"></span>2. “Lord, my heart is not lifted up”
([Psa. 131.1](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#001.md)<span
id="ii.CXXXI-p6.1"></span>). He hath offered a sacrifice. Whence do we
<span id="page_615">p. 615</span> <span
id="ii.CXXXI-Page_615"></span>prove that he hath offered a sacrifice?
Because humility of heart is a sacrifice.…If there is no sacrifice,
there is no Priest. But if we have a High Priest in Heaven, who
intercedeth with the Father for us (for He hath entered into the Holy of
Holies, within the veil),…we are safe, for we have a Priest; let us
offer our sacrifice there. Let us consider what sacrifice we ought to
offer; for God is not pleased with burnt-offerings, as ye have heard in
the Psalm. But in that place he next showeth what he offereth: “The
sacrifice of God is a troubled spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O
God, shalt Thou not despise. <span id="fr_5577"></span>[5578](#fn_5577.md)

<span id="ii.CXXXI-p8"></span>3. “Lord, my heart was not lifted up,
neither were mine eyes raised on high” ([Psa.
131.1](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#001.md)<span
id="ii.CXXXI-p8.1"></span>); “I have not exercised myself in great
matters, nor in wonderful things which are too high for me” ([Psa.
131.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#002.md)<span
id="ii.CXXXI-p8.2"></span>). Let this be more plainly spoken and heard.
I have not been proud: I have not wished to be known among men as for
wondrous powers; nor have I sought anything beyond my strength, whereby
I might boast myself among the ignorant. As that Simon the sorcerer
wished to advance into wonders above himself, on that account the power
of the Apostles more pleased him, than the righteousness of
Christians.…What is above my strength, he saith, I have not sought; I
have not stretched myself out there, I have not chosen to be magnified
there. How deeply this self-exaltation in the abundance of graces is to
be feared, that no man may pride himself in the gift of God, but may
rather preserve humility, and may do what is written: “The greater thou
art, the more humble thyself, and thou shalt find favour before the
Lord:” <span id="fr_5578"></span>[5579](#fn_5578.md) how deeply pride in
God’s gift should be feared, we must again and again impress upon you.…

<span id="ii.CXXXI-p10"></span>4. “If I had not lowly thoughts, but have
lifted up my soul, as one taken from his mother’s breast, such the
reward for my soul” ([Psa. 131.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#002.md)<span
id="ii.CXXXI-p10.1"></span>). He seemeth as it were to have bound
himself by a curse:…as though he had been going to say, Let it so happen
to me. “As one taken away from his mother’s breast, may be my soul’s
reward.” Ye know that the Apostle saith to some weak brethren, “I have
fed you with milk, and not with meat; for hitherto ye were not able to
bear it, neither yet now are ye able.” <span
id="fr_5579"></span>[5580](#fn_5579.md) There are weak persons who are not
fit for strong meat; they wish to grasp at that which they cannot
receive: and if they ever do receive, or seem to themselves to receive
what they have not received, they are puffed up thereby, and become
proud thereupon; they seem to themselves wise men. Now this happeneth to
all heretics; who since they were animal and carnal, by defending their
depraved opinions, which they could not see to be false, were shut out
of the Catholic Church.…

<span id="ii.CXXXI-p12"></span>5. Another opinion indeed hath been
entertained, and another sense in these words.…It has been evidently
explained, my brethren, where God would have us to be humble, where
lofty. Humble, in order to provide against pride; lofty, to take in
wisdom. Feed upon milk, that thou mayest be nourished; be nourished, so
that thou mayest grow; grow, so that thou mayest eat bread. But when
thou hast begun to eat bread, thou wilt be weaned, that is, thou wilt no
longer have need of milk, but of solid food. This he seemeth to have
meant: “If I had not lowly thoughts, but have lifted up my soul:” that
is, if I was not an infant in mind, I was in wickedness. In this sense,
he said before, “Lord, my heart was not lifted up, nor mine eyes raised
on high: I do not exercise myself in great matters, nor in wonderful
things above me.” Behold, in wickedness I am an infant. But since I am
not an infant in understanding, “If I had not lowly thoughts, but have
lifted up my soul,” may that reward be mine which is given unto the
infant that is weaned from his mother, that I may at length be able to
eat bread.

<span id="ii.CXXXI-p13"></span>6. This interpretation, also, brethren,
displeaseth me not, since it doth not militate against the faith. Yet I
cannot but remark that it is not only said, “As one taken away from
milk, such may be my soul’s reward;” but with this addition, “As one
taken away from milk when upon his mother’s breast, such may be my
soul’s reward.” Here there is somewhat that induces me to consider it a
curse. For it is not an infant, but a grown child that is taken away
from milk; he who is weak in his earliest infancy, which is his true
infancy, is upon his mother’s breast: if perchance he hath been taken
away from the milk, he perisheth. It is not without a reason then that
it is added, “Upon his mother’s breast.” For all may be weaned by
growing. He who groweth, and is thus taken away from milk, it is good
for him; but hurtful for him who is still upon his mother’s breast. We
must therefore beware, my brethren, and be fearful, lest any one be
taken away from milk before his time.…Let him not therefore wish to lift
up his soul, when perchance he is not fit to take meat, but let him
fulfil the commandments of humility. He hath wherein he may exercise
himself: let him believe in Christ, that he may understand Christ. He
cannot see the Word, he cannot understand the equality of the Word with
the Father, he cannot as yet see the equality of the Holy Spirit with
the Father and the Word; let him believe this, and suck it. He is safe,
because, when he hath grown, he will eat, which he could not do before
he grew by suck<span id="page_616">p. 616</span> <span
id="ii.CXXXI-Page_616"></span>ing: and he hath a point to stretch
towards. Seek not out the things that are too hard for thee, and search
not the things that are above thy strength; that is, things which thou
art not as yet fit to understand. And what am I to do? thou repliest.
Shall I remain thus? “But what things the Lord hath commanded thee,
think thereupon always.”  <span id="fr_5580"></span>[5581](#fn_5580.md)
What hath the Lord commanded thee? Do works of mercy, part not with the
peace of the Church, place not thy trust in man, tempt not God by
longing for miracles.…

<span id="ii.CXXXI-p15"></span>7. For if ye be not exalted, if ye raise
not your heart on high, if ye tread not in great matters that are too
high for you, but preserve humility, God will reveal unto you what ye
are otherwise minded in. <span id="fr_5581"></span>[5582](#fn_5581.md) But
if ye choose to defend this very thing, which ye are otherwise minded
about, and with pertinacity assert it, and against the peace of the
Church; this curse which he hath described is entailed upon you; when ye
are upon your mother’s breast, and are removed away from the milk, ye
shall die of hunger apart from your mother’s breast. But if ye continue
in Catholic peace, if perchance ye are in anything otherwise minded than
ye ought to be, God will reveal it to you, if ye be humble. Wherefore?
Because “God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace unto the
humble.” <span id="fr_5582"></span>[5583](#fn_5582.md)

<span id="ii.CXXXI-p18"></span>8. This Psalm therefore concludeth to
this purpose: “O Israel, trust in the Lord, from this time forth and
even unto eternity” <span id="fr_5583"></span>[5584](#fn_5583.md) ([Psa.
131.3](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#003.md)<span
id="ii.CXXXI-p19.2"></span>). But the word *seculum* doth not always
mean this world, but sometimes eternity; since eternity is understood in
two ways; until eternity, that is, either evermore without end, or until
we arrive at eternity. How then is it to be understood here? Until we
arrive at eternity, let us trust in the Lord God; because when we have
reached eternity, there will be no longer hope, but the thing itself
will be ours.
