<span id="ii.XLIII-p1"></span> <span id="ii.XLIII-p1.1"></span><span
class="c20"><span id="ii.XLIII-p1.2"></span>Psalm XLIII. <span
id="fr_1275"></span>[1276](#fn_1275.md) </span>

<span id="ii.XLIII-p3"></span>1. This Psalm is a short one; it satisfies
the mental cravings of the hearers, without imposing too severe a trial
on the hunger of those fasting. <span
id="fr_1276"></span>[1277](#fn_1276.md) Let our soul feed upon it; our
soul, which he who sings in this Psalm, speaks of as “cast down;” cast
down, I suppose, either in consequence of some fist, or rather in
consequence of some hunger he was in. For fasting is a voluntary act;
being an-hungered is an involuntary thing. That which is an-hungered, is
the Church, is the Body of Christ: and that “Man” who is extended
throughout the whole world, of which the Head is above, the limbs below:
it is His voice which ought by this time to be perfectly known, and
perfectly familiar, to us, in all the Psalms; now chanting joyously, now
sorrowing; now rejoicing in hope, now sighing at its actual state, even
as if it were our own. We need not then dwell long on pointing out to
you, who is the speaker here: let each one of us be a member of Christ’s
Body; and he will be speaker here.…

<span id="ii.XLIII-p5"></span>2. “Judge me, O Lord, and separate my
cause from the ungodly nation” ([Psa.
43.1](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#001)<span id="ii.XLIII-p5.1"></span>.md).
I do not dread Thy judgment, because I know Thy mercy. “Judge me, O
God,” he cries. Now, meanwhile, in this state of pilgrimage, Thou dost
not yet separate my place, because I am to live together with the
“tares” even to the time of the “harvest:” Thou dost not as yet separate
my rain from theirs; my light from theirs: “separate my cause.” Let a
difference be made between him who believes in Thee, and him who
believes not in Thee. Our infirmity is the same; but our consciences not
the same: our sufferings the same; but our longings not the same. “The
desire of the ungodly shall perish,” <span
id="fr_1277"></span>[1278](#fn_1277.md) but as to the desire of the
righteous, we might well doubt, if He were not “sure” who promised. The
object of our desires is He Himself, who promiseth: He will give us
Himself, because He has already given Himself to us; He will give
Himself in His immortality to us then immortal, even because He gave
Himself in His mortality to us when mortal.…

<span id="ii.XLIII-p7"></span>3. And since patience is needful in order
to endure, until the harvest, a certain distinction without
separation, <span id="fr_1278"></span>[1279](#fn_1278.md) if we may so
speak (for they are together with us, and therefore not yet separated;
the tares however being still tares, and the corn still corn, and
therefore they are already distinct); since then a kind of
strength <span id="fr_1279"></span>[1280](#fn_1279.md) is needful, which
must be implored of Him who bids us to be strong, and without whose
making us strong, we should not be what He bids us to be; of Him who
said, “He that endures unto the end shall be saved,” <span
id="fr_1280"></span>[1281](#fn_1280.md) lest the soul’s powers should be
impaired in consequence of her ascribing any strength to herself, he
subjoins immediately,

<span id="ii.XLIII-p11"></span>“For Thou, O God, art my strength: why
hast Thou cast me off, and why go I mourning, while the enemy harasseth
me?” ([Psa. 43.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#002.md)<span
id="ii.XLIII-p11.1"></span>). I go mourning: the enemy is harassing me
with daily temptations: inspiring either some unlawful love, or some
ungrounded cause of fear; and the soul that fights against both of them,
though not taken prisoner by them, yet being in danger from them, is
contracted with sorrow, and says unto God, “Why?”

<span id="ii.XLIII-p12"></span>Let her then ask of Him, and hear “Why?”
For she is in the Psalm enquiring the cause of her dejection; saying,
“Why hast Thou cast me off? and why go I mourning?” Let her hear from
Isaiah; let the lesson which has just been read, suggest itself to her.
“The spirit shall go forth from me, and every breath have I made. For
iniquity have I a little afflicted him; I hid my face from him, and he
departed from me sorrowful in the ways of his heart.”  <span
id="fr_1281"></span>[1282](#fn_1281.md) Why then didst thou ask, “Why hast
Thou cast me off, and why go I mourning?” Thou hast heard, it was “for
iniquity.” “Iniquity” is the cause of thy mourning; let “Righteousness”
be the cause of thy rejoicing! Thou wouldest sin; and yet thou wouldest
fain not suffer; so that it was too little for thee to be thyself
unrighteous, without also wishing Him to be unrighteous, in that thou
wouldest fain not be punished by Him. Consider a speech of a better kind
in another Psalm. “It is good for me that Thou hast humbled me, that I
might learn Thy righteousnesses.” <span
id="fr_1282"></span>[1283](#fn_1282.md) By being lifted up, I had learned
my own iniquities; let me by being “humbled,” learn “Thy
righteousnesses.” “Why go I mourning, while the enemy harasses me?” Thou
complainest of the enemy. It is true he does harass thee; but it was
thou didst “give place” <span id="fr_1283"></span>[1284](#fn_1283.md) to
him. And even now there is a course open to thee; choose the course of
prudence; admit thy King, shut the tyrant out.

<span id="ii.XLIII-p16"></span><span id="page_139">p. 139</span> <span
id="ii.XLIII-Page_139"></span>4. But in order that she may do this, hear
what she says, what she supplicates, what she prays for. Pray thou for
what thou hearest; pray for it when thou hearest it; let these words be
the voice of us all: “O send out Thy Light and Thy Truth. They have led
me, and brought me on unto Thy holy hill, and into Thy Tabernacles”
([Psa. 43.3](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#003.md)<span
id="ii.XLIII-p16.1"></span>). For that very “Light” and “Truth” are
indeed two in name; the reality expressed is but One. For what else is
the “Light” of God, except the “Truth” of God? Or what else is the
“Truth” of God, except the “Light” of God? And the one Person of Christ
is both of these. “I am the Light of the world: he that believeth on Me,
shall not walk in darkness.” “I am the Way, the Truth, and the
Life.” <span id="fr_1284"></span>[1285](#fn_1284.md) He is Himself “the
Light:” He is Himself “the Truth.” Let Him come then and rescue us, and
“separate at once our cause from the ungodly nation; let Him deliver us
from the deceitful and unjust man,” let him separate the wheat from the
tares, for at the time of harvest He will Himself send His Angels, that
they may “gather out of His kingdom all things that offend,” <span
id="fr_1285"></span>[1286](#fn_1285.md) and cast them into flaming fire,
while they gather together the corn into the garner. He will send out
His “Light,” and His “Truth;” for that they have already “brought us and
led us to His holy hill, and into His Tabernacles.” We possess the
“earnest;” <span id="fr_1286"></span>[1287](#fn_1286.md) we hope for the
prize. “His holy Hill” is His holy Church. It is that mountain which,
according to Daniel’s vision, <span id="fr_1287"></span>[1288](#fn_1287.md)
grew from a very small “stone,” till it crushed the kingdoms of the
earth; and grew to such a size, that it “filled the face of the earth.”
This is the “hill,” from which he tells us that his prayer was heard,
who says, “I cried unto the Lord with my voice, and He heard me out of
His holy hill.” <span id="fr_1288"></span>[1289](#fn_1288.md) Let no one of
those that are without that mountain, hope to be heard unto eternal
life. For many are heard in their prayers for many things. Let them not
congratulate themselves <span id="fr_1289"></span>[1290](#fn_1289.md) on
being heard; the devils were heard in their prayer, that they might be
sent into the swine. Let us desire to be heard unto eternal life, by
reason of our longing, through which we say, “Send out Thy Light and Thy
Truth.” <span id="fr_1290"></span>[1291](#fn_1290.md) That is a “Light”
which requires the eye of the heart. For “Blessed” (He saith) “are the
pure in heart, for they shall see God.” <span
id="fr_1291"></span>[1292](#fn_1291.md) We are now on His Hill, that is, in
His Church, and in His Tabernacle. The “tabernacle” is for persons
sojourning; the house, for those dwelling in one community. <span
id="fr_1292"></span>[1293](#fn_1292.md) The tabernacle is also for those
who are both from home, and also in a state of warfare. When thou
hearest of a tabernacle, form a notion of a war; guard against an enemy.
But what shall the house be? “Blessed are they that dwell in Thine
house: they will be alway praising Thee.” <span
id="fr_1293"></span>[1294](#fn_1293.md)

<span id="ii.XLIII-p27"></span>5. Now then that we have been led on even
to “the Tabernacle,” and are placed on “His holy Hill,” what hope do we
carry with us?

<span id="ii.XLIII-p28"></span>“Then will I go in unto the Altar of God”
([Psa. 43.4](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#004.md)<span
id="ii.XLIII-p28.1"></span>). For there is a certain invisible Altar on
high, which the unrighteous man approaches not. To that Altar he alone
draws nigh, who draws nigh to this one without cause to fear. There he
shall find his Life, who in this one “separates his cause.” “And I will
go in unto the Altar of God.” From His holy Hill, and from His
Tabernacle, from His Holy Church, I will go in unto the Altar of God on
High. What manner of Sacrifice is there? He himself who goeth in is
taken for a burnt-offering. “I will go in unto the Altar of God.” What
is the meaning of what he says, “The Altar of my God”?

<span id="ii.XLIII-p29"></span>“Unto God, who makes glad my youth.”
Youth signifies newness: just as if he said, “Unto God, who makes glad
my newness.” It is He who makes glad my newness, who hath filled my old
estate <span id="fr_1294"></span>[1295](#fn_1294.md) with mourning. For now
“I go mourning” in oldness, then shall “I stand,” exulting in newness!

<span id="ii.XLIII-p31"></span>“Yea, upon the harp will I praise Thee, O
God my God.” What is the meaning of “praising on the harp,” and praising
on the psaltery? For he does not always do so with the harp, nor always
with the psaltery. These two instruments of the musicians have each a
distinct meaning of their own, worthy of our consideration and notice.
They are both borne in the hands, and played by the touch; and they
stand for certain bodily works of ours. Both are good, if one knows how
to play the psaltery, <span id="fr_1295"></span>[1296](#fn_1295.md) or to
play the harp. <span id="fr_1296"></span>[1297](#fn_1296.md) But since the
psaltery is that instrument which has the shell <span
id="fr_1297"></span>[1298](#fn_1297.md) (i.e. that drum, that hollow piece
of wood, by straining on which <span
id="fr_1298"></span>[1299](#fn_1298) the chords resound.md) on the upper
part of it, whereas the harp has that same concave sounding-board on the
lower part, there is to be a distinction made between our works, when
they are “upon the harp,” when “on the psaltery:” both however are
acceptable to God, and grateful to His ear. When we do anything
according to God’s Commandments, obeying His commands and hearkening to
Him, that we may fulfil His injunctions, when we are active and not
passive, it is the psaltery that is playing. For so also do the Angels:
for they have nothing to suffer. But when we suffer anything of
tribulation, of trials, of offences on this earth (as we suffer only
from the inferior part of ourselves; i.e. from the fact that we are
mortal, that we owe somewhat of tribulation to our <span
id="page_140">p. 140</span> <span id="ii.XLIII-Page_140"></span>original
cause, <span id="fr_1299"></span>[1300](#fn_1299.md) and also from the fact
of our suffering much from those who are not “above”); this is “the
harp.” For there rises a sweet strain from that part of us which is
“below:” we “suffer,” and we strike the psaltery, <span
id="fr_1300"></span>[1301](#fn_1300.md) or shall I rather say we sing and
we strike the harp.…

<span id="ii.XLIII-p38"></span>6. And again, in order that he may draw
the sound from that sounding-board below, he addresses his soul: he
says, “Why art thou sorrowful, O my soul, and why dost thou disquiet
me?” ([Psa. 43.5](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#005.md)<span
id="ii.XLIII-p38.1"></span>). I am in tribulations, in weariness, <span
id="fr_1301"></span>[1302](#fn_1301.md) in mourning, “Why dost thou
disquiet me, O my soul?” Who is the speaker, to whom is he speaking?
That it is the soul to which he is speaking, everybody knows: for it is
obvious: the appeal is addressed to it directly: “Why art thou
sorrowful, O my soul, and why dost thou disquiet me?” The question is as
to the speaker. It is not the flesh addressing the soul, surely, since
the flesh cannot speak without the soul. For it is more appropriate for
the soul to address the flesh, than for the flesh to address the
soul.…We perceive then that we have a certain part, in which is “the
image of God;” viz. the mind and reason. <span
id="fr_1302"></span>[1303](#fn_1302.md) It was that same mind that prayed
for “God’s Light” and “God’s Truth.” It is the same mind by which we
apprehend <span id="fr_1303"></span>[1304](#fn_1303.md) right and wrong: it
is by the same that we discern truth from falsehood. It is this same
that we call “understanding;” which “understanding,” indeed, is wanting
to the brutes. And this “understanding” whoever neglects in himself, and
holds it in less account than the other parts of his nature, and casts
it off, just as if he had it not, is addressed in the Psalm, “Be ye not
as the horse and the mule, which have no understanding.”  <span
id="fr_1304"></span>[1305](#fn_1304.md) It is our “understanding” then that
is addressing our soul. The latter is withered away from tribulations,
worn out in anguish, <span id="fr_1305"></span>[1306](#fn_1305.md) made
“sorrowful” in temptations, fainting in toils. The mind, catching a
glimpse of Truth above, would fain rouse her spirits, and she says, “Why
art thou sorrowful, O my soul?”…

<span id="ii.XLIII-p44"></span>7. These expressions, brethren, are safe
ones: but yet be watchful in good works. Touch “the psaltery,” by
obeying the Commandments; touch the harp, by patiently enduring your
sufferings. You have heard from Isaiah, “Break thy bread to the
hungry;” <span id="fr_1306"></span>[1307](#fn_1306.md) think not that
fasting by itself is sufficient. Fasting chasteneth thine own self: it
does not refresh others. Thy distress will profit thee, if thou
affordest comfort <span id="fr_1307"></span>[1308](#fn_1307.md) to others.
See, thou hast denied thyself; to whom wilt thou give that of which thou
hast deprived thyself? Where wilt thou bestow what thou hast denied
thyself? How many poor may be filled <span
id="fr_1308"></span>[1309](#fn_1308.md) by the breakfast <span
id="fr_1309"></span>[1310](#fn_1309.md) we <span
id="fr_1310"></span>[1311](#fn_1310.md) have this day given up? Fast in
such a way that thou mayest rejoice, that thou hast breakfasted, while
another has been eating; fast on account of thy prayers, that thou
mayest be heard in them. For He says in that passage, “Whilst thou art
yet speaking I will say, Here I am,” <span
id="fr_1311"></span>[1312](#fn_1311.md) provided thou wilt with cheerful
mind “break thy bread to the hungry.” For generally this is done by men
reluctantly and with murmurs, to rid themselves of the wearisome
importunity of the beggar, not to refresh the bowels of him that is
needy. But it is “a cheerful giver” that “God loves.” <span
id="fr_1312"></span>[1313](#fn_1312.md) If thou givest thy bread
reluctantly, thou hast lost both the bread, and the merit of the action.
Do it then from the heart: that He “who seeth in secret,” <span
id="fr_1313"></span>[1314](#fn_1313.md) may say, “whilst thou art yet
speaking, Here I am.” How speedily are the prayers of those received,
who work righteousness! And this is man’s righteousness in this life,
fasting, alms, and prayer. Wouldest thou have thy prayer fly upward to
God? Make for it those two wings of alms and fasting. Such may God’s
“Light” and God’s “Truth” find us, that He may find us without cause for
fear, when He comes to free us from death, who has already come to
undergo death for us. Amen.
