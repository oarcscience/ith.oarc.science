<span id="ii.XCVI-p1"></span> <span id="ii.XCVI-p1.1"></span><span
class="c20"><span id="ii.XCVI-p1.2"></span>Psalm XCVI. <span
id="fr_4412"></span>[4413](#fn_4412.md) </span>

<span id="ii.XCVI-p3"></span>1. My lord and brother Severus <span
id="fr_4413"></span>[4414](#fn_4413.md) still defers the pleasure we shall
feel in his discourse, which he oweth us; for he acknowledgeth, that he
is held a debtor. For all the Churches through which he hath passed, by
his tongue the lord hath gladdened: much more therefore ought that
Church to be rejoiced, out of which the Lord hath propagated his
preaching among the rest. But what shall we do, but obey his will? I
said, however, brethren, that he deferred, not that he defrauded us.
Therefore let us keep him as a debtor bound, and release him not until
he hath paid. Attend therefore, beloved: as far as the Lord alloweth,
let us say somewhat of this Psalm, which indeed you already know; for
the fresh mention of truth is sweet. Possibly when its title was
pronounced, some heard it with wonder. For the Psalm is inscribed: “When
the house was being built after the Captivity.” This title having been
prefixed, ye were perhaps expecting in the text of the Psalm to hear
what stones were hewn from the mountains, what masses were drawn to the
spot, what foundations were laid, what beams were placed on high, what
columns raised. Its song is of nothing of this kind.…It is no such house
that is in building; for behold where it is built, not in one spot, not
in any particular region. For thus he beginneth:—

<span id="ii.XCVI-p5"></span>2. “O sing unto the Lord a new song; sing
unto the Lord, all the earth” <span id="fr_4414"></span>[4415](#fn_4414.md)
([Psa. 96.1](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#001.md)<span
id="ii.XCVI-p6.2"></span>). If all the earth singeth a new song, it is
thus building while it singeth: the very act of singing is building: but
only, if it singeth not the old song. The lust of the flesh singeth the
old song: the love of God singeth the new.…Hear why it is a new song:
the Lord saith, “A new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one
another.” <span id="fr_4415"></span>[4416](#fn_4415.md) The whole earth
then singeth a new song: there the house of God is built. All the earth
is the house of God. If all the earth is the house of God, <span
id="fr_4416"></span>[4417](#fn_4416.md) he who clingeth not to all the
earth, is a ruin, not a house; that old ruin whose shadow that ancient
temple represented. For there what was old was destroyed, that what was
new might be built up.…The Apostle bindeth us together into this very
structure, and fasteneth us when bound together in that unity, saying,
“Forbearing one another in love; endeavouring to keep the unity of the
Spirit in the bond of peace.” <span id="fr_4417"></span>[4418](#fn_4417.md)
Where there is this unity of Spirit, there is one stone; but one stone
formed out of many. How one formed out of many? By forbearing one
another in love. Therefore the house of the Lord our God is in building;
it is this that is being wrought, for this are these words, for this
these readings, for this the preaching of the Gospel over the whole
world; as yet it is in building. This house hath increased greatly, and
filled many nations: nevertheless, it hath not yet prevailed through all
nations: by its increase it hath held many, and will prevail over all:
and it is gainsaid by those who boast of their being of its household,
and who say, it hath already lost ground. It still increaseth, still all
those nations which have not yet believed are destined to believe; that
no man may say, <span id="page_471">p. 471</span> <span
id="ii.XCVI-Page_471"></span>will that tongue believe? will the
barbarians believe? what is the meaning of the Holy Spirit having
appeared in the fiery tongues,  <span
id="fr_4418"></span>[4419](#fn_4418.md) except that there is no tongue so
hard that it cannot be softened by that fire? For we know that many
barbarous nations have already believed in Christ: Christ already
possesseth regions where the Roman empire hath never yet reached; what
is as yet closed to those who fight with the sword, is not closed to Him
who fighteth with wood. For “the Lord hath reigned from the wood.” <span
id="fr_4419"></span>[4420](#fn_4419.md) Who is it who fighteth with wood?
Christ. With His cross He hath vanquished kings, and fixed upon their
forehead, when vanquished, that very cross; and they glory in it, for in
it is their salvation. This is the work which is being wrought, thus the
house increaseth, thus it is building: and that ye may know, hear the
following verses of the Psalm: see them labouring upon, and constructing
the house. “O sing unto the Lord all the earth.”

<span id="ii.XCVI-p12"></span>3. “Sing unto the Lord, bless His Name: be
telling good tidings of His salvation from day to day” ([Psa.
96.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#002)<span id="ii.XCVI-p12.1"></span>.md).
How doth the building increase? “Be telling,” he saith, “good tidings of
His salvation from day to day.” Let it be preached from day to day; from
day to day, he saith, let it be built; let My house, saith God,
increase. And as if it were said by the workmen, Where dost Thou command
it to be built? Where dost Thou will Thy house to increase? Choose for
us some level, spacious spot, if Thou wish an ample house built Thee.
Where dost Thou bid us be telling good tidings from day to day? He
showeth the place: “Declare His honour unto the heathen:” His honour,
not yours. O ye builders, “Declare His honour unto the heathen.” Should
ye choose to declare your own honour, ye shall fall: if His, ye shall be
built up, while ye are building. Therefore they who choose to declare
their own honour, have refused to dwell in that house; and therefore
they sing not a new song with all the earth. <span
id="fr_4420"></span>[4421](#fn_4420.md) For they do not share it with the
whole round world; and hence they are not building in the house, but
have erected a whited wall. How sternly doth God threaten the whited
wall? <span id="fr_4421"></span>[4422](#fn_4421.md) There are innumerable
testimonies of the Prophets, whence He curseth the whited wall. What is
the whited wall, save hypocrisy, that is, pretence? Without it is
bright, within it is dirt.…A certain person, <span
id="fr_4422"></span>[4423](#fn_4422.md) speaking of this whited wall, said
thus: “as, if in a wall which standeth alone, and is not connected with
any other walls, you make a door, whoever enters, is out of doors; so in
that part which hath refused to sing the new song together with the
house, but hath chosen to build a wall, and that a whited one, and not
solid, what availeth it that it hath a door?” If thou enterest, thou art
found to be without. For because they themselves did not enter by the
door, their door also doth not admit them within. For the Lord saith, “I
am the door: by Me they enter in.” <span
id="fr_4423"></span>[4424](#fn_4423.md) …“Declare His honour unto the
heathen.” What is, unto the heathen? Perhaps by nations but a few are
meant: and that part which hath raised the whited wall hath still
somewhat to say: why are not Getulia, Numidia, Mauritania, Byzacium,
nations? Provinces are nations. Let the word of God take the word from
hypocrisy, from the whited wall, building up the house over the whole
world. It is not enough to say, “Declare His honour unto the heathen;”
that thou mayest not think any nations excepted, he addeth, “and His
wonders unto all people.”

<span id="ii.XCVI-p17"></span>4. “For the Lord is great, and cannot
worthily be praised” ([Psa. 96.4](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#004.md)<span
id="ii.XCVI-p17.1"></span>). What Lord, except Jesus Christ, “is great,
and cannot worthily be praised”? Ye know surely that He appeared as a
Man: ye know surely that He was conceived in a woman’s womb, ye know
that He was born from the womb, that He was suckled, that He was carried
in arms, circumcised, that a victim was offered for Him, that He grew;
lastly, ye know that He was buffeted, spit upon, crowned with thorns,
was crucified, died, was pierced with a spear; ye know that He suffered
all these things: “He is great, and cannot worthily be praised.” Despise
not what is little, understand what is great. He became little, because
ye were such: let Him be acknowledged great, and in Him ye shall be
great.…For what can a small tongue say towards the praise of the Great
One? By saying, Beyond praise, <span
id="fr_4424"></span>[4425](#fn_4424.md) he hath spoken, and hath given to
imagination what it may conceive: as if saying, What I cannot utter, do
thou reflect on; and when thou shalt have reflected, it will not be
enough. What no man’s thought uttereth, doth any man’s tongue utter?
“The Lord is great, and cannot worthily be praised.” Let Him be praised,
and preached: His honour declared, and His house built.

<span id="ii.XCVI-p19"></span>5. …For the spot where he wished to build
the house, is itself woody, where it was said yesterday, “we found it in
the wood.” <span id="fr_4425"></span>[4426](#fn_4425.md) For he was seeking
that very house, when he said, “in the wood.” And why is that spot
woody? Men used to worship images: it is not wonderful that they fed
hogs. For that son who left his father, <span id="page_472">p.
472</span> <span id="ii.XCVI-Page_472"></span>and spent his all on
harlots, living as a prodigal, used to feed hogs, <span
id="fr_4426"></span>[4427](#fn_4426.md) that is, to worship devils; and by
this very superstition of the heathen, all the earth became a wood. But
he who buildeth a house, rooteth up the wood; and for this reason it was
said, “While the house was being built, after the captivity.” <span
id="fr_4427"></span>[4428](#fn_4427.md) For men were held captive under the
devil, and served devils; but they were redeemed from captivity. They
could sell, but they could not redeem themselves. The Redeemer came, and
gave a price; He poured forth His Blood, and bought the whole world. Ye
ask what He bought? Ye see what He hath given; find out then what He
bought. The Blood of Christ was the price. What is equal to this? What,
but the whole world? What, but all nations? They are very ungrateful for
their price, or very proud, who say that the price is so small that it
bought the Africans only; or that they are so great, as that it was
given for them alone. Let them not then exult, let them not be proud: He
gave what He gave for the whole world. He knew what He bought, because
He knew at what price He bought it. Thus because we are redeemed, the
house is built after the captivity. And who are they who held us in
captivity? Because they to whom it is said, “Declare His honour,” are
the clearers of the wood: that they may root out the wood, free the
earth from captivity, and build, and raise up, by declaring the
greatness of the Lord’s house. How is the wood of devils cleared away,
unless He who is above them all be preached? All nations then had devils
for their gods: those whom they called gods, were devils, as the Apostle
more openly saith, “The things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they
sacrifice unto devils, and not to God.”  <span
id="fr_4428"></span>[4429](#fn_4428.md) Since therefore they were in
captivity, because they sacrificed to devils, and on that account the
whole earth had remained woody; He is declared to be great, and above
all worldly praise.

<span id="ii.XCVI-p24"></span>6. …For when he had said, “He is more to
be feared than all gods:” he added, “As for all the gods of the heathen,
they are devils.”…Because “all the gods of the heathen are devils.” And
is this all the praise of Him who cannot worthily be praised, that He is
above all the gods of the heathen, which are devils? Wait, and hear what
followeth: “It is the Lord that made the heavens.” Not above all gods
only therefore, but above all the heavens which He made, is the Lord. If
he were to say, “above all gods, for the gods of the heathen are
devils,” and if the praise of our Lord stopped here, he had said less
than we are accustomed to think of Christ; but when he said, “But it is
the Lord that made the heavens;” see what difference there is between
the heavens and devils: and what between the heavens and Him who made
the heavens; behold how exalted is the Lord. He said not, But the Lord
sitteth above the heavens; for perhaps some one else might be imagined
to have made them, upon which He was enthroned: but, “It is the Lord
that made the heavens.” If He made the heavens, He made the Angels also:
Himself made the Angels, Himself made the Apostles. The devils yielded
to the Apostles: but the Apostles themselves were heavens, who bore the
Lord.…O heavens, which He made, declare His honour unto the heathen! Let
His house be built throughout the earth, let all the earth sing a new
song.

<span id="ii.XCVI-p25"></span>7. “Confession and beauty are before Him”
([Psa. 96.6](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#006.md)<span
id="ii.XCVI-p25.1"></span>). Dost thou love beauty? Wishest thou to be
beautiful? Confess! He said not, beauty and confession, but confession
and beauty. Thou wast foul; confess, that thou mayest be fair: thou wast
a sinner; confess, that thou mayest be righteous. Thou couldest deform
thyself: thou canst not make thyself beautiful. But of what sort is our
Betrothed, who hath loved one deformed, that he might make her fair?
How, saith some one, loved He one deformed? “I came not,” said He, “to
call the righteous, but sinners.” <span
id="fr_4429"></span>[4430](#fn_4429.md) Whom callest Thou? sinners, that
they may remain sinners? No, saith He. And by what means will they cease
to be sinners? “Confession and beauty are before Him.” They honour Him
by confession of their sins, they vomit the evils which they had
greedily devoured; they return not to their vomit, like the unclean
dog; <span id="fr_4430"></span>[4431](#fn_4430.md) and there will then be
confession and beauty: we love beauty; let us first choose confession,
that beauty may follow. Again, there is one who loveth power and
greatness: he wisheth to be great as the Angels are. There is a certain
greatness in the Angels; and such power, that if the Angels exert it to
the full, it cannot be withstood. And every man desireth the power of
the Angels, but their righteousness every man loveth not. First love
righteousness, and power shall follow thee. For what followeth here?
“Holiness and greatness are in His sanctification.” Thou wast before
seeking for greatness: first love righteousness: when thou art
righteous, thou shall also be great. For if thou preposterously dost
wish first to be great, thou fallest before thou canst rise: for thou
dost not rise, thou art raised up. Thou risest better, if He raise thee
who falleth not. For He who falleth not descendeth unto thee: thou hadst
fallen: He descendeth, He hath stretched forth His hand unto thee; thou
canst not rise by thy own strength, embrace the hand of Him who <span
id="page_473">p. 473</span> <span
id="ii.XCVI-Page_473"></span>descendeth, that thou mayest be raised up
by the Strong One.

<span id="ii.XCVI-p28"></span>8. What then? If “confession and beauty
are before Him: holiness and greatness in His sanctification” ([Psa.
96.7](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#007)<span id="ii.XCVI-p28.1"></span>.md).
This we declare, when we are building the house; behold, it is already
declared unto the heathen; what ought the heathen to do, to whom those
who have cleared away the wood have declared the Lord’s honour? He now
saith to the heathen themselves, “Ascribe unto the Lord, O ye kindreds
of the people: ascribe unto the Lord worship and honour.” Ascribe them
not unto yourselves: because they also who have declared it unto you,
have not declared their own, but His honour. Do ye then “ascribe unto
the Lord worship and honour;” and say, “Not unto us, O Lord, not unto
us: but unto Thy Name give the praise.” <span
id="fr_4431"></span>[4432](#fn_4431.md) Put not your trust in man. If each
of you is baptized, let him say: He baptizeth me, of whom the friend of
the Bridegroom said, “He baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.” <span
id="fr_4432"></span>[4433](#fn_4432.md) For when ye say this, ye ascribe
unto the Lord worship and honour: “Ascribe unto the Lord worship and
honour.”

<span id="ii.XCVI-p31"></span>9. “Ascribe unto the Lord glory unto His
Name” ([Psa. 96.8](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#008.md)<span
id="ii.XCVI-p31.1"></span>). Not unto the name of man, not unto your own
name, but unto His ascribe worship.…Confession is a present unto God. O
heathen, if ye will enter into His courts, enter not empty. “Bring
presents.” What presents shall we bring with us? The sacrifice of God is
a troubled spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, “O God, shalt not Thou
despise.”  <span id="fr_4433"></span>[4434](#fn_4433.md) Enter with an
humble heart into the house of God, and thou hast entered with a
present. But if thou art proud, thou enterest empty. For whence wouldest
thou be proud, if thou wert not empty? For if thou wast full, thou
wouldest not be puffed up. How couldest thou be full? If thou wert to
bring a present, which thou shouldest carry to the courts of the Lord.
Let us not retain you much longer: let us run over what remaineth.
Behold the house increasing: behold the edifice pervade the whole world.
Rejoice, because ye have entered into the courts; rejoice, because ye
are being built into the temple of God. For those who enter are
themselves built up, they themselves are the house of God: He is the
inhabitor, for whom the house is built over the whole world, and this
“after the captivity.” “Bring presents, and come into His courts.”

<span id="ii.XCVI-p33"></span>10. “O worship the Lord in His holy court”
([Psa. 96.9](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#009.md)<span
id="ii.XCVI-p33.1"></span>): in the Catholic Church; this is His holy
court. Let no man say, “Lo, here is Christ, or there. For there shall
arise false prophets.” <span id="fr_4434"></span>[4435](#fn_4434.md) Say
this unto them, <span id="fr_4435"></span>[4436](#fn_4435.md) “There shall
not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.”
Ye are calling me to the whited wall; I adore my God in His holy court.
“Let the whole earth be moved before His face.”

<span id="ii.XCVI-p36"></span>11. “Tell it out among the nations, that
the Lord reigneth from the wood: <span
id="fr_4436"></span>[4437](#fn_4436.md) and that it is He who hath made the
round world so fast that it cannot be moved” ([Psa.
96.10](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#010.md)<span
id="ii.XCVI-p37.1"></span>). What testimonies of the building of the
house of God! The clouds of heaven thunder out throughout the world that
God’s house is being built; and the frogs cry from the marsh, <span
id="fr_4437"></span>[4438](#fn_4437.md) We alone are Christians. What
testimonies do I bring forward? That of the Psalter. I bring forward
what thou singest as one deaf: open thine ears; thou singest this; thou
singest with me, and thou agreest not with me; thy tongue soundeth what
mine doth, and yet thine heart disagreeth with mine. Dost thou not sing
this? Behold the testimonies of the whole world: “Let the whole earth be
moved before His face:” and dost thou say, that thou art not moved?
“Tell it out among the heathen, that the Lord hath reigned from the
wood.” Shall men perchance prevail here, and say they reign by wood,
because they reign by means of the clubs of their bandits? <span
id="fr_4438"></span>[4439](#fn_4438.md) Reign by the Cross of Christ, if
thou art to reign by wood. For this wood of thine maketh thee wooden:
the wood of Christ passeth thee across the sea. Thou hearest the Psalm
saying, “He hath set aright the round world, that it cannot be moved;”
and thou sayest it hath not only been moved since it was made fast, but
hath also decreased. Dost thou speak the truth, and the Psalmist
falsehood? Do the false prophets, when they cry out, “Lo, here is
Christ, and there,”  <span id="fr_4439"></span>[4440](#fn_4439.md) speak
truth; and doth this Prophet lie? Brethren, against these most open
words ye hear in the corners rumours like these; “such an one was a
traditor,” and, “such an one was a traditor.” <span
id="fr_4440"></span>[4441](#fn_4440.md) What dost thou say? Are thy words,
or the words of God, to be heard? For, “it is He who hath set aright the
round world, that it cannot be moved.” I show unto thee the round world
built: bring thy present, and come into the courts of the Lord. Thou
hast no presents: and on that account thou art not willing to enter.
What is this? If God were to appoint unto thee a bull, goat, or ram, for
a present, thou wouldest find one to bring: He hath appointed a humble
heart, and thou wilt not enter; for thou findest not this in thyself,
because thou art swollen with pride. “He hath set aright the round
world, that it cannot be moved: and He shall judge the people right<span
id="page_474">p. 474</span> <span id="ii.XCVI-Page_474"></span>eously.”
Then shall they mourn, who now refuse to love righteousness.

<span id="ii.XCVI-p42"></span>12. “Let the heavens rejoice, and let the
earth be glad” ([Psa. 96.11](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#011.md)<span
id="ii.XCVI-p42.1"></span>). Let the heavens, which declare the glory of
God, rejoice; let the heavens rejoice, which the Lord made; let the
earth be glad, which the heavens rain upon. For the heavens are the
preachers, the earth the listeners. “Let the sea be stirred up, and the
fulness thereof.” What sea? The world. The sea hath been stirred up, and
the fulness thereof: the whole world was roused up against the Church,
while it was being extended and built over all the earth. Concerning
this stirring up, ye have heard in the Gospel, “They shall deliver you
up to councils.” <span id="fr_4441"></span>[4442](#fn_4441.md) “The sea was
stirred up: but how should the sea ever conquer Him who made it?

<span id="ii.XCVI-p44"></span>13. “The plains shall be joyful, and all
things that are in them” ([Psa.
96.12](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#012.md)<span
id="ii.XCVI-p44.1"></span>). All the meek, all the gentle, all the
righteous, are the “plains” of God. “Then shall all the trees of the
woods rejoice.” The trees of the woods are the heathen. Why do they
rejoice? Because they were cut off from the wild olive, and engraffed
into the good olive. <span id="fr_4442"></span>[4443](#fn_4442.md) “Then
shall all the trees of the woods rejoice:” because huge cedars and
cypresses have been cut down, and undecaying timbers have been bought
for the building of the house. They were trees of the woods; but before
they were sent to the building: they were trees of the woods, but before
they produced the olive.

<span id="ii.XCVI-p46"></span>14. “Before the face of the Lord. For He
cometh, for He cometh to judge the world” ([Psa.
96.13](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#013.md)<span
id="ii.XCVI-p46.1"></span>). He came at first, and will come again. He
first came in His Church in clouds. What are the clouds which bore Him?
The Apostles who preached, respecting whom ye have heard, when the
Epistle was being read: “We are ambassadors,” he saith, “for Christ: we
pray you in Christ’s stead, be ye reconciled to God.”  <span
id="fr_4443"></span>[4444](#fn_4443.md) These are the clouds in whom He
cometh, excepting His last Advent, when He will come to judge the quick
and the dead. He came first in the clouds. This was His first voice
which sounded forth in the Gospel: “From this time shall they see the
Son of Man coming in the clouds.” <span
id="fr_4444"></span>[4445](#fn_4444.md) What is, “from this time”? Will not
the Lord come in later times, when all the tribes of the earth shall
mourn? He first came in His own preachers, and filled the whole round
world. Let us not resist His first coming, that we may not tremble at
His second. “But woe to them that are with child, and that give suck in
those days!” <span id="fr_4445"></span>[4446](#fn_4445.md) Ye have heard
but now in the Gospel: “Take ye heed, for ye know not at what hour He
cometh.” <span id="fr_4446"></span>[4447](#fn_4446.md) This is said
figuratively. Who are those with child, and who give suck? Those who are
with child, are the souls whose hope is in the world: but those who have
gained what they hoped for, are meant by “they who give suck.” For
example: one wisheth to buy a country seat; he is with child, for his
object is not gained as yet, the womb swelleth in hope: he buyeth it; he
hath brought forth, he now giveth suck to what he hath bought. “Woe to
them that are with child, and that give suck in those days!” Woe to
those who put their hope in the world; woe to them that cling to those
things which they brought forth through hope in the world. What then
should the Christian do? He should use, not serve, the world. <span
id="fr_4447"></span>[4448](#fn_4447.md) What is this? Those that have as
those that have not.…He who is without carefulness, waiteth without fear
for his Lord’s coming. For what sort of love is it of Christ, to fear
lest He come? Brethren, are we not ashamed? We love Him, and yet we fear
lest He come. Are we sure that we love Him? or do we love our sins more?
Therefore let us hate our sins for their own sake, and love Him who will
come to punish our sins. He will come, whether we like or not: for
because He cometh not just now, it is no reason that He will not come at
all. He will come, and when thou knowest not; and if He shall find thee
ready, thy ignorance is no hurt to thee. “Then shall all the trees of
the wood rejoice before the Lord; for He cometh:” at His first coming.
And what afterwards? “For He cometh to judge the earth. And all the
trees of the woods shall rejoice.” He came first: and later to judge the
earth: He shall find those rejoicing who believed in His first coming,
“for He cometh.”

<span id="ii.XCVI-p52"></span>15. “For with righteousness shall He judge
the world:” not a part of it, for He bought not a part: He will judge
the whole, for it was the whole of which He paid the price. Ye have
heard the Gospel, where it saith, that when He cometh, “He shall gather
together His elect from the four winds.” <span

four winds: therefore from the whole world. For Adam <span
id="fr_4449"></span>[4450](#fn_4449) himself (this I had said before.md)
signifieth in Greek the whole world; for there are four letters, A, D,
A, and M. But as the Greeks speak, the four quarters of the world have
these initial letters, ’<span class="Greek"><span

class="Greek"><span id="ii.XCVI-p54.2"></span>Δύσις</span><span

<span class="Greek"><span id="ii.XCVI-p54.5"></span>Μεσημβρία</span>,
the South: thou hast the word Adam. Adam therefore hath been scattered
over the whole world. He was in one place, and fell, and as in a manner
broken small, <span id="fr_4450"></span>[4451](#fn_4450.md) he filled the
whole world: but the mercy of God <span id="page_475">p. 475</span>
<span id="ii.XCVI-Page_475"></span>gathered together the fragments from
every side, and forged <span id="fr_4451"></span>[4452](#fn_4451.md) them
by the fire of love, and made one what was broken. That Artist knew how
to do this; let no one despair: it is indeed a great thing, but reflect
who that Artist was. He who made, restored: He who formed, reformed.
What are righteousness and truth? He will gather together His elect with
Him to the judgment, but the rest He will separate one from another; for
He will place some on the right, others on the left hand. But what is
more just, what more true, than that they shall not expect mercy from
their Judge, who have refused to act mercifully, before their Judge
come? But those who chose to act with mercy, with mercy shall be
judged.…
