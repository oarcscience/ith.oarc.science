LXVI](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#000.md)<span
id="ii.LXVI-p1.1"></span><span class="c20"><span
id="ii.LXVI-p1.2"></span>. <span id="fr_2580"></span>[2581](#fn_2580.md)
</span>

<span id="ii.LXVI-p3"></span>1. This Psalm hath on the title the
inscription, “For the end, a song of a Psalm of Resurrection.” When ye
hear “for the end,” whenever the Psalms are repeated, understand it “for
Christ:” the Apostle saying, “For the end of the law is Christ, for
righteousness to every one believing.” <span
id="fr_2581"></span>[2582](#fn_2581.md) In what manner therefore here
Resurrection is sung, ye wilt hear, and whose Resurrection it is, as far
as Himself deigneth to give and disclose. For the Resurrection we
Christians know already hath come to pass in our Head, and in the
members it is to be. The Head of the Church is Christ, <span
id="fr_2582"></span>[2583](#fn_2582.md) the members of Christ are the
Church. That which hath preceded in the Head, will follow in the Body.
This is our hope; for this we believe, for this we endure and persevere
amid so great perverseness of this world, hope comforting us, before
that hope becometh reality.…The Jews did hold the hope of the
resurrection of the dead: and they hoped that themselves alone would
rise again to a blessed life because of the work of the Law, and because
of the justifications of the Scriptures, which the Jews alone had, and
the Gentiles had not. Crucified was Christ, “blindness in part happened
unto Israel, in order that the fulness of the Gentiles might enter
in:” <span id="fr_2583"></span>[2584](#fn_2583.md) as the Apostle saith.
The resurrection of the dead beginneth to be promised to the Gentiles
also that believe in Jesus Christ, that He hath risen again. Thence this
Psalm is against the presumption and pride of the Jews, for the comfort
of the Gentiles that are to be called to the same hope of resurrection.

<span id="ii.LXVI-p7"></span>2. …Thence he beginneth, “Be joyful in
God.” Who? “Every land” ([Psa.
66.1](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#001)<span id="ii.LXVI-p7.1"></span>.md).
Not therefore Judæa alone. See, brethren, after what sort is set forth
the universality of the Church in the whole world spread abroad: and
mourn ye not only the Jews, who envied the Gentiles that grace, but
still more for heretics wail ye. For if they are to be mourned, that
have not been gathered together, how much more they that being gathered
together have been divided? “Jubilate in God every land.” What is
“jubilate”? Into the voice of rejoicings break forth if ye cannot into
that of words. For “jubilation” is not of words, but the sound alone of
men rejoicing is uttered, as of a heart labouring and bringing forth
into voice the pleasure of a thing imagined which cannot be expressed.
“Be joyful in God every land:” let no one jubilate in a part: let every
land be joyful, let the Catholic Church jubilate. The Catholic Church
embraceth the whole: whosoever holdeth a part and from the whole is cut
off, should howl, not jubilate.

<span id="ii.LXVI-p8"></span>3. “But play ye to His name” ([Psa.
66.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#002)<span id="ii.LXVI-p8.1"></span>.md).
What hath he said? By you “playing” let His name be blessed. But what it
is to “play”? To play is also to take up an instrument which is called a
psaltery, and by the striking and action of the hands to accompany
voices. If therefore ye jubilate so that God may hear; play also
something that men may both see and hear: but not to your own name.…For
if for the sake of yourselves being glorified ye do good works, we make
the same reply as He made to certain of such men, “Verily I say unto
you, they have received their reward:” <span
id="fr_2584"></span>[2585](#fn_2584.md) and again, “Otherwise no reward ye
will have with your Father that is in Heaven.” <span
id="fr_2585"></span>[2586](#fn_2585.md) Thou wilt say, ought I, then, to
hide my works, that I do them not before men? No. But what saith He?
“Let your works shine before men.” In doubt then I shall remain. On one
side Thou sayest to me, “Take heed that ye do not your righteousness
before men:” on the other side Thou sayest to me, “Let your good works
shine before men;” what shall I keep? what do? what leave undone? A man
can as well serve two masters commanding different things as one
commanding different things. I command not, saith the Lord, different
things. The end observe, for the end sing: with what end thou doest it,
see thou. If for this reason thou doest it, that thou mayest be
glorified, I have forbidden it: but if for this reason, that God may be
glorified, I have commanded it. Play therefore, not to your own name,
but to the name of the Lord your God. Play ye, let Him be lauded: live
ye well, let Him be glorified. For whence have ye that same living well?
If for everlasting ye had had it, ye would never have lived ill; if from
yourselves ye had had it, ye never would have done otherwise than have
lived well. “Give glory to His praise.” Our whole attention upon the
praise of God he directeth, nothing for us he leaveth whence we should
be praised. Let us glory thence the more, and rejoice: to Him let us
cleave, in Him let us be praised. Ye heard when the Apostle was being
read, “See ye your calling, brethren, how not many wise after the flesh,
not many mighty, not many noble, but the foolish things of the world God
hath chosen to confound the wise.” <span
id="fr_2586"></span>[2587](#fn_2586.md) …But the Lord chose afterwards
orators also; but they would have been proud, if He had not first chosen
fishermen; He chose rich men; but they would have said that on account
of their riches they had been chosen, unless at first He had chosen poor
men: He chose Emperors afterwards; but better is it, that when an
Emperor hath come to Rome, he should lay aside his crown, and weep at
the monument of a fisherman, than that a fisherman should weep at the
<span id="page_275">p. 275</span> <span
id="ii.LXVI-Page_275"></span>monument of an Emperor. “For the weak
things of the world God hath chosen to confound the strong,” etc. <span
id="fr_2587"></span>[2588](#fn_2587.md) …And what followeth? The Apostle
hath concluded, “That there might not glory before God any flesh.” See
ye how from us He hath taken away, that He might give glory: hath taken
away ours, that He might give His own; hath taken away empty, that He
might give full; hath taken away insecure, that He might give solid.…

<span id="ii.LXVI-p13"></span>4. “Say ye to God, How to be feared are
Thy works!” ([Psa. 66.3](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#003.md)<span
id="ii.LXVI-p13.1"></span>). Wherefore to be feared and not to be loved?
Hear thou another voice of a Psalm: “Serve ye the Lord in fear, and
exult unto Him with trembling.” <span
id="fr_2588"></span>[2589](#fn_2588.md) What meaneth this? Hear the voice
of the Apostle: “With fear,” he saith, “and trembling, your own
salvation work ye out.” <span id="fr_2589"></span>[2590](#fn_2589.md)
Wherefore with fear and trembling? He hath subjoined the reason: “for
God it is that worketh in you both to will and to work according to good
will.” <span id="fr_2590"></span>[2591](#fn_2590.md) If therefore God
worketh in thee, by the Grace of God thou workest well, not by thy
strength. Therefore if thou rejoicest, fear also: lest perchance that
which was given to a humble man be taken away from a proud
one.…Brethren, if against the Jews of old, cut off from the root of the
Patriarchs, we ought not to exalt ourselves, but rather to fear and say
to God, “How to be feared are Thy works:” how much less ought we not to
exalt ourselves against the fresh wounds of the cutting off! Before
there had been cut off Jews, graffed in Gentiles; from the very graft
there have been cut off heretics; but neither against them ought we to
exalt ourselves; lest perchance he deserve to be cut off, that
delighteth to revile them that are cut off. My brethren, a bishop’s
voice, however unworthy, hath sounded to you: <span
id="fr_2591"></span>[2592](#fn_2591.md) we pray you to beware, whosoever ye
are in the Church, do not revile them that are not within; but pray ye
rather, that they too may be within. For God is able again to graft them
in. <span id="fr_2592"></span>[2593](#fn_2592.md) Of the very Jews the
Apostle said this, and it was done in their case. The Lord rose again,
and many believed: they perceived not when they crucified, nevertheless
afterwards they believed in Him, and there was forgiven them so great a
transgression. The shedding of the Lord’s blood was forgiven the
manslayers, not to say, God-slayers: “for if they had known, the Lord of
glory they never would have crucified.” <span
id="fr_2593"></span>[2594](#fn_2593.md) Now to the manslayers hath been
forgiven the shedding of the blood of Him innocent: and that same blood
which through madness they shed, through grace they have drunk.…O
fulness of Gentiles, say thou to God, “How to be feared are Thy works!”
and so rejoice thou as that thou mayest fear, be not exalted above the
branches cut off.

<span id="ii.LXVI-p20"></span>5. “In the multitude of thy power Thine
enemies shall lie to Thee.” For this purpose he saith, “to Thee thine
enemies shall lie,” in order that great may be Thy power. What is this?
With more attention hearken. The power of our Lord Jesus Christ most
chiefly appeared in the Resurrection, from whence this Psalm hath
received its title. And rising again, He appeared to His
disciples. <span id="fr_2594"></span>[2595](#fn_2594.md) He appeared not to
His enemies, but to His disciples. Crucified He appeared to all men,
rising again to believers: so that afterwards also he that would might
believe, and to him that should believe, resurrection might be promised.
Many holy men wrought many miracles; no one of them when dead did rise
again: because even they that by them were raised to life, were raised
to life to die.…Because therefore the Jews might say, when the Lord did
miracles, Moses hath done these things, Elias hath done, Eliseus hath
done them: they might for themselves say these words, because those men
also did raise to life dead men, and did many miracles: therefore when
from Him a sign was demanded, of the peculiar sign making mention which
in Himself alone was to be, He saith, “This generation crooked and
provoking <span id="fr_2595"></span>[2596](#fn_2595.md) seeketh a sign, and
a sign shall not be given to it, except the sign of Jonas the Prophet:
for as Jonas was in the belly of the whale three days and three nights,
so shall be also the Son of Man in the heart of the earth three days and
three nights.” <span id="fr_2596"></span>[2597](#fn_2596.md) In what way
was Jonas in the belly of the whale? Was it not so that afterwards alive
he was vomited out? Hell <span id="fr_2597"></span>[2598](#fn_2597.md) was
to the Lord what the whale was to Jonas. This sign peculiar to Himself
He mentioned, this is the most mighty sign. It is more mighty to live
again after having been dead, than not to have been dead. The greatness
of the power of the Lord as He was made Man, in the virtue of the
Resurrection doth appear.…

<span id="ii.LXVI-p25"></span>6. Observe also the very lie of the false
witnesses in the Gospel, and see how it is about Resurrection. For when
to the Lord had been said, “What sign showest Thou to us, that Thou
doest these things?” <span id="fr_2598"></span>[2599](#fn_2598.md) besides
that which He had spoken about Jonah <span
id="fr_2599"></span>[2600](#fn_2599.md) through another similitude of this
same thing also He spake, that ye might know this peculiar sign had been
especially pointed out: “Destroy this Temple,” He saith, “and in three
days I will raise it up.” And they said, “In forty and six years was
builded this temple, and wilt Thou in three <span id="page_276">p.
276</span> <span id="ii.LXVI-Page_276"></span>days raise it up?” <span
id="fr_2600"></span>[2601](#fn_2600.md) And the evangelist explaining what
it was, “But this,” he saith, “spake Jesus of the Temple of His
Body.” <span id="fr_2601"></span>[2602](#fn_2601.md) Behold this His power
He said He would show to men in the same thing as that from whence He
had given the similitude of a Temple, because of His flesh, which was
the Temple of the Divinity hidden within. Whence the Jews outwardly saw
the Temple, the Deity dwelling within they saw not. Out of those words
of the <span class="c21"><span id="ii.LXVI-p29.2"></span>Lord</span>
false witnesses made up a lie to say against Him, out of those very
words wherein He mentioned His future Resurrection, in speaking of the
Temple. For false witnesses, when they were asked what they had heard
Him say, alleged against Him: “We heard Him saying, I will destroy this
Temple, and after three days I will raise it up.” <span
id="fr_2602"></span>[2603](#fn_2602.md) “After three days I will raise up,”
they had heard: “I will destroy,” they had not heard: but had heard
“destroy ye.” One word they changed and a few letters, in order to
support their false testimony. But for whom changest thou a word, O
human vanity, O human weakness? For the Word, the Unchangeable, dost
thou change a word? Thou changest thy word, dost thou change God’s
Word?…Wherefore said they that Thou hadst said, “I will destroy;” and
said not that which Thou saidest, “destroy ye”? It was, as it were, in
order that they might defend themselves from the charge of destroying
the Temple without cause. For Christ, because He willed it, died: and
nevertheless ye killed Him. Behold we grant you, O ye liars, Himself
destroyed the Temple. For it hath been said by the Apostle, “That loved
me, and gave up Himself for me.” <span
id="fr_2603"></span>[2604](#fn_2603.md) It hath been said of the Father,
“That His own Son spared not, but gave Him up for us all.” <span
id="fr_2604"></span>[2605](#fn_2604.md) …By all means be it that Himself
destroyed the Temple, Himself destroyed that said, “Power I have to lay
down My Soul, <span id="fr_2605"></span>[2606](#fn_2605.md) and power I
have again to take it: no one taketh it from Me, but I Myself lay it
down from Me, and again I take it.” <span
id="fr_2606"></span>[2607](#fn_2606.md) Be it that Himself hath destroyed
the Temple in His Grace, in your malice. “In the multitude of Thy power
thine enemies shall lie to Thee.” Behold they lie, behold they are
believed, behold Thou art oppressed, behold Thou art crucified, behold
Thou art insulted, behold head is wagged at Thee, “If Son of God He is,
let Him come down from the Cross.” <span
id="fr_2607"></span>[2608](#fn_2607.md) Behold when Thou wilt, life Thou
layest down, and with lance in the side art pierced, and Sacraments from
Thy side flow forth; <span id="fr_2608"></span>[2609](#fn_2608.md) Thou art
taken down from the Tree, wound in linens, laid in the sepulchre, there
are set guards lest Thy disciples take Thee away; there cometh the hour
of Thy Resurrection, earth is shaken, tombs are cloven, Thou risest
again in secret, appearest openly. Where then are those liars? Where is
the false testimony of evil will? Have not Thine enemies in the
multitude of Thy power lied to Thee?

<span id="ii.LXVI-p37"></span>7. Give them also those guards at the
Tomb, let them recount what they have seen, let them take money and lie
too. <span id="fr_2609"></span>[2610](#fn_2609.md) …They too were added to
the lie of the enemies: increased was the number of liars, that
increased might be the reward of believers. Therefore they lied, “in the
multitude of Thy power” they lied: to confound liars Thou hast appeared
to men of truth, and Thou hast appeared to those men of truth whom Thou
hast made men of truth.

<span id="ii.LXVI-p39"></span>8. Let Jews remain in their lies: to Thee,
because in the multitude of Thy power they lied, let there be done that
which followeth, “Let every land worship Thee, and play to Thee, play to
Thy name, O Most Highest” ([Psa.
66.4](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#004)<span id="ii.LXVI-p39.1"></span>.md).
A little before, Most Lowly, now Most Highest: Most Lowly in the hands
of lying enemies; Most Highest above the head of praising Angels. O ye
Gentiles, O most distant nations, leave lying Jews, come confessing.
“Come ye, and see the works of the Lord: terrible in counsels above the
sons of men” ([Psa. 66.5](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#005.md)<span
id="ii.LXVI-p39.2"></span>). Son of Man indeed He too hath been called,
and verily Son of Man He became: very Son of God in the form of
God; <span id="fr_2610"></span>[2611](#fn_2610.md) very Son of Man in form
of a servant: but do not judge of that form by the condition of others
alike: “terrible” He is “in counsels above the sons of men.” Sons of men
took counsel to crucify Christ, being crucified He blinded the
crucifiers. What then have ye done, sons of men, by taking keen counsels
against your Lord, in whom was hidden Majesty, and to sight shown
weakness? Ye were taking counsels to destroy, He to blind and save; to
blind proud men, to save humble men: but to blind those same proud men,
to the end that, being blinded they might be humbled, being humbled
might confess, having confessed might be enlightened. “Terrible in
counsels above the sons of men.” Terrible indeed. Behold blindness in
part to Israel hath happened: <span id="fr_2611"></span>[2612](#fn_2611.md)
behold the Jews, out of whom was born Christ, are without: behold the
Gentiles, that were against Judæa, in Christ are within. “Terrible in
counsels above the sons of men.”

<span id="ii.LXVI-p42"></span>9. Wherefore what hath He done by the
terror of His counsel? He hath turned the sea into dry land. For this
followeth, “That hath turned the sea into dry land” ([Psa.
66.6](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#006)<span id="ii.LXVI-p42.1"></span>.md).
A sea was the world, bitter with saltness, troubled with tempest, raging
with waves of persecutions, sea it was: truly into dry land the sea hath
been <span id="page_277">p. 277</span> <span
id="ii.LXVI-Page_277"></span>turned, now there thirsteth for sweet water
the world that with salt water was filled. Who hath done this? He “that
hath turned the sea into dry land.” Now the soul of all the Gentiles
saith what? “My soul is as it were land without water to Thee.” <span
id="fr_2612"></span>[2613](#fn_2612.md) “That hath turned the sea into dry
land. In the river they shall pass over on foot.” Those same persons
that have been turned into dry land, though they were before sea, “in
the river on foot shall pass over.” What is the river? The river is all
the mortality of the world. Observe a river: some things come and pass
by, other things that are to pass by do succeed. Is it not thus with the
water of a river, that from earth springeth and floweth? Every one that
is born must needs give place to one going to be born: and all this
order of things rolling along is a kind of river. Into this river let
not the soul greedily throw herself, let her not throw herself, but let
her stand still. And how shall she pass over the pleasures of things
doomed to perish? Let her believe in Christ, and she will pass over on
foot: she passeth over with Him for Leader, on foot she passeth over.

<span id="ii.LXVI-p44"></span>10. “There we will be joyous in Him.” O ye
Jews, of your own works boast ye: lay aside the pride of boasting of
yourselves, take up the Grace of being joyous in Christ. For therein we
will be joyous, but not in ourselves: “there we will be joyous in Him.”
When shall we joy? When we shall have passed over the river on foot.
Life everlasting is promised, resurrection is promised, there our flesh
no longer shall be a river: for a river it is now, while it is
mortality. Observe whether there standeth still any age. Boys desire to
grow up; and they know not how by succeeding years the span of their
life is lessened. For years are not added to but taken from them as they
grow: just as the water of a river alway draweth near, but from the
source it withdraweth. And boys desire to grow up that they may escape
the thraldom of elders; behold they grow up, it cometh to pass quickly,
they arrive at youth: let them that have emerged from boyhood retain, if
they are able, their youth: that too passeth away. Old age
succeedeth: <span id="fr_2613"></span>[2614](#fn_2613.md) let even old age
be everlasting; with death it is removed. Therefore a river there
is <span id="fr_2614"></span>[2615](#fn_2614.md) of flesh that is born.
This river of mortality, so that it doth not by reason of concupiscence
of things mortal undermine and carry him away, he easily passeth over,
that humbly, that is on foot, passeth over, He being leader that first
hath passed over, that of the flood in the way even unto death hath
drunk, and therefore hath lifted up the head. <span
id="fr_2615"></span>[2616](#fn_2615.md) Passing over therefore on foot that
river, that is, easily passing over that mortality that glideth along,
“there we will be joyous in Him.” But now in what save in Him, or in the
hope of Him? For even if we are joyous now, in hope we are joyous; but
then in Him we shall be joyous. And now in Him, but through hope: “but
then face to face.” <span id="fr_2616"></span>[2617](#fn_2616.md) “There we
will be joyous in Him.”

<span id="ii.LXVI-p49"></span>11. In whom? “In Him that reigneth in His
virtue for everlasting” ([Psa.
66.7](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#007)<span id="ii.LXVI-p49.1"></span>.md).
For what virtue have we and is it everlasting? If everlasting were our
virtue, we should not have slipped, should not have fallen into sin, we
should not have deserved penal mortality. He, of His good pleasure, took
up that whereunto our desert threw us down. <span
id="fr_2617"></span>[2618](#fn_2617.md) “That reigneth in His virtue for
everlasting.” Of Him partakers let us be made, in whose virtue we shall
be strong, but He in His own. We enlightened, He a light enlightening:
we, being turned away from Him, are in darkness; turned away from
Himself He cannot be. With the heat of Him we are warmed; from whence
withdrawing we had grown cold, to the Same drawing near again we are
warmed. Therefore let us speak to Him that He may keep us in His virtue,
because “in Him we will be joyous that reigneth in His virtue for
everlasting.”

<span id="ii.LXVI-p51"></span>12. But this thing is not granted to
believing Jews alone.…“The eyes of Him do look upon the Gentiles.” And
what do we? The Jews will murmur; the Jews will say, “what He hath given
to us, the same to them also; to us Gospel, to them Gospel; to us the
Grace of Resurrection, and to them the Grace of Resurrection; doth it
profit us nothing that we have received the Law, and that in the
justifications of the Law we have lived, and have kept the commandments
of the fathers? Nothing will it avail? The same to them as to us.” Let
them not strive, let them not dispute. “Let not them that are bitter be
exalted in their own selves.” <span id="fr_2618"></span>[2619](#fn_2618.md)
O flesh miserable and wasting, art thou not sinful? Why crieth out thy
tongue? Let the conscience be listened to. “For all men have sinned, and
need the glory of God.” <span id="fr_2619"></span>[2620](#fn_2619.md) Know
thyself, human weakness. Thou didst receive the Law, in order that a
transgressor also of the Law thou mightest be: <span
id="fr_2620"></span>[2621](#fn_2620.md) for thou hast not kept and
fulfilled that which thou didst receive. There hath come to thee because
of the Law, not the justification which the Law enjoineth, but the
transgression which thou hast done. If therefore there hath abounded
sin, why enviest thou Grace more abounding. Be not bitter, for “let not
them that are bitter be <span id="page_278">p. 278</span> <span
id="ii.LXVI-Page_278"></span>exalted in their own selves.” He seemeth in
a manner to have uttered a curse in “Let not them that are bitter be
exalted;” yea, be they exalted, but not “in themselves.” Let them be
humbled in themselves, exalted in Christ. For, “he that humbleth himself
shall be exalted; and he that exalteth himself shall be humbled.” <span
id="fr_2621"></span>[2622](#fn_2621.md) “Let not them that are bitter be
exalted in their own selves.”

<span id="ii.LXVI-p56"></span>13. “Bless our God, ye nations” ([Psa.
66.8](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#008)<span id="ii.LXVI-p56.1"></span>.md).
Behold, there have been driven back they that are bitter, reckoning hath
been made with them: some have been converted, some have continued
proud. Let not them terrify you that grudge the Gentiles Gospel Grace:
now hath come the Seed of Abraham, in whom are blessed all
nations. <span id="fr_2622"></span>[2623](#fn_2622.md) Bless ye Him in whom
ye are blessed, “Bless our God, ye nations: and hear ye the voice of His
praise.” Praise not yourselves, but praise Him. What is the voice of His
praise? That by His Grace we are whatever of good we are. “Who hath set
my Soul unto life” ([Psa. 66.9](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#009.md)<span
id="ii.LXVI-p57.2"></span>) Behold the voice of his praise: “Who hath
set my Soul unto life.” Therefore in death she was: in death she was, in
thyself. Thence it is that ye ought not to have been exalted in
yourselves. Therefore in death she was, in thyself: where will it be in
life, save in Him that said, “I am the Way, the Truth, and the
Life”? <span id="fr_2623"></span>[2624](#fn_2623.md) Just as to certain
believers the Apostle saith, “Ye were sometime darkness, but now light
in the Lord.” <span id="fr_2624"></span>[2625](#fn_2624.md) …“And hath not
given unto motion my feet.” He hath set my Soul unto life, He guideth
the feet that they stumble not, be not moved and given unto motion; He
maketh us to live, He maketh us to persevere even unto the end, in order
that for everlasting we may live.…

<span id="ii.LXVI-p60"></span>14. “For thou hast proved us, O God; Thou
hast fired us as silver is fired” ([Psa.
66.10](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#010.md)<span
id="ii.LXVI-p60.1"></span>). Hast not fired us like hay, but like
silver: by applying to us fire, Thou hast not turned us into ashes, but
Thou hast washed off uncleanness, “Thou hast fired us, as silver is
fired.” And see in what manner God is wroth against them, whose Soul He
hath set unto life. “Thou hast led us into a trap:” not that we might be
caught and die, but that we might be tried and delivered from it. “Thou
hast laid tribulations upon our back.” For having been to ill purpose
lifted up, proud we were: having been to ill purpose lifted up, we were
bowed down, in order that being bowed down, we should be lifted up for
good. “Thou hast laid tribulations on our back:” “Thou hast set men over
our heads” ([Psa. 66.11](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#011.md)<span
id="ii.LXVI-p60.2"></span>). All these things the Church hath suffered
in sundry and divers persecutions: She hath suffered this in Her
individual members, even now doth suffer it. For there is not one, that
in this life could say that he was exempt from these trials. Therefore
there are set even men over our heads: we endure those whom we would
not, we suffer for our betters those whom we know to be worse. But if
sins be wanting, a man is justly superior: but by how much there are
more sins, by so much he is inferior. And it is a good thing to consider
ourselves to be sinners, and thus endure men set over our heads: in
order that we also to God may confess that deservedly we suffer. For why
dost thou suffer with indignation that which He doeth who is just? “Thou
hast laid tribulations upon our back: Thou hast set men over our heads.”
God seemeth to be wroth, when He doeth these things: fear not, for a
Father He is, He is never so wroth as to destroy. When ill thou livest,
if He spareth, He is more angry. In a word, these tribulations are the
rods of Him correcting, lest there be a sentence from Him punishing.…

<span id="ii.LXVI-p61"></span>15. “We have passed through fire and
water.” Fire and water are both dangerous in this life. Certainly water
seemeth to extinguish fire, and fire seemeth to dry up water. Thus also
these are the trials, wherein aboundeth this life. Fire burneth, water
corrupteth: both must be feared, both the burning of tribulation and the
water of corruption. Whenever there is adversity, and anything which is
called unhappiness in this world, there is as it were fire: whenever
there is prosperity, and the world’s plenty floweth about one, there is
as it were water. See that fire burn thee not, nor water corrupt.…Hasten
not to the water: through fire pass over to the water, that thou mayest
pass over the water also. Therefore also in the mystic rites <span
id="fr_2625"></span>[2626](#fn_2625.md) and in catechising and in
exorcising, <span id="fr_2626"></span>[2627](#fn_2626.md) there is first
used fire. For whence ofttimes do the unclean spirits cry out, “I burn,”
if that is not fire? But after the fire of Exorcism we come to Baptism:
so that from fire to water, from water unto refreshment. But as in the
Sacraments, so it is in the temptations of this world: the straitness of
fear draweth near first, in place of fire; afterwards fear being
removed, we ought to be afraid lest worldly happiness corrupt. But when
the fire hath not made thee burst, and when thou hast not sunk in the
water, but hast swum out; through discipline thou passest over to rest,
and passing over through fire and water, thou art led forth into a place
of refreshment. For of those things whereof the signs are in the
Sacraments, there are the very realities in that perfection of life
everlasting.…But we are not torpid there, but we rest: nor though it be
called heat, shall we be hot there, but we shall be fervent in spirit.
Observe that same heat in another Psalm: “nor is there any one that
hideth himself from the <span id="page_279">p. 279</span> <span
id="ii.LXVI-Page_279"></span>heat thereof.” <span
id="fr_2627"></span>[2628](#fn_2627.md) What saith also the Apostle? “In
spirit fervent.” <span id="fr_2628"></span>[2629](#fn_2628.md) Therefore,
“we have gone over through fire and water: and Thou hast led us forth
into a cool place.”

<span id="ii.LXVI-p66"></span>16. Observe how not only concerning a cool
place, but neither of that very fire to be desired he hath been silent:
“I will enter into Thy House in holocausts” ([Psa.
66.13](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#013.md)<span
id="ii.LXVI-p66.1"></span>). What is a holocaust? A whole sacrifice
burned up, but with fire divine. For a sacrifice is called a holocaust,
when the whole is burned. One thing are the parts of sacrifices, another
thing a holocaust: when the whole is burned and the whole consumed by
fire divine, it is called a holocaust: when a part, a sacrifice. Every
holocaust indeed is a sacrifice: but not every sacrifice a holocaust.
Holocausts therefore he is promising, the Body of Christ is speaking,
the Unity of Christ is speaking, “I will enter into Thy House in
holocausts.” All that is mine let Thy fire consume, let nothing of mine
remain to me, let all be Thine. But this shall be in the Resurrection of
just men, “when both this corruptible shall be clad in incorruption, and
this mortal shall be clad in immortality: then shall come to pass that
which hath been written, ‘Death is swallowed up in victory.’” <span
id="fr_2629"></span>[2630](#fn_2629.md) Victory is, as it were, fire
divine: when it swalloweth up our death also, it is a holocaust. There
remaineth not anything mortal in the flesh, there remaineth not anything
culpable in the spirit: the whole of mortal life shall be consumed, in
order that in life everlasting it may be consummated, that from death we
may be preserved in life. <span id="fr_2630"></span>[2631](#fn_2630.md)
These therefore will be the holocausts. And what shall there be “in the
holocausts”?

<span id="ii.LXVI-p69"></span>17. “I will render to Thee my vows, which
my lips have distinguished” ([Psa.
66.14](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#014.md)<span
id="ii.LXVI-p69.1"></span>). What is the distinction in vows? This is
the distinction, that thyself thou censure, Him thou praise: perceive
thyself to be a creature, Him the Creator: thyself darkness, Him the
Enlightener, to whom thou shouldest say, “Thou shalt light my lamp, O
Lord my God, Thou shalt enlighten my darkness.” <span
id="fr_2631"></span>[2632](#fn_2631.md) For whenever thou shalt have said,
O soul, that from thyself thou hast light, thou wilt not distinguish. If
thou wilt not distinguish, thou wilt not render distinct vows. Render
distinct vows, confess thyself changeable, Him unchangeable: confess
thyself without Him to be nothing, but Himself without thee to be
perfect; thyself to need Him, but Him not to need thee. Cry to Him, “I
have said to the Lord, My God art Thou, for my good things Thou needest
not.”  <span id="fr_2632"></span>[2633](#fn_2632.md) Now though God taketh
thee to Him for a holocaust, He groweth not, He is not increased, He is
not richer, He becometh not better furnished: whatsoever He maketh of
thee for thy sake, is the better for thee, not for Him that maketh. If
thou distinguishest these things, thou renderest the vows to thy God
which thy lips have distinguished.

<span id="ii.LXVI-p72"></span>18. “And my mouth hath spoken in my
tribulation.” How sweet ofttimes is tribulation, how necessary! In that
case what hath the mouth of the same spoken in his tribulation?
“Holocausts marrowed I will offer to Thee” ([Psa.
66.15](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#015.md)<span
id="ii.LXVI-p72.1"></span>). What is “marrowed”? Within may I keep Thy
love, it shall not be on the surface, in my marrow it shall be that I
love Thee. For there is nothing more inward than our marrow: the bones
are more inward than the flesh, the marrow is more inward than those
same bones. Whosoever therefore on the surface loveth God, desireth
rather to please men, but having some other affection within, he
offereth not holocausts of marrow: but into whosesoever marrow He
looketh, him He receiveth whole. “With incense and rams.” The rams are
the rulers of the Church: the whole Body of Christ is speaking: this is
the thing which he offereth to God. Incense  <span
id="fr_2633"></span>[2634](#fn_2633.md) is what? Prayer. “With incense and
rams.” For especially the rams do pray for the flocks. “I will offer to
Thee oxen with he-goats.” Oxen we find treading out corn, and the same
are offered to God. The Apostle hath said, that of the preachers of the
Gospel must be understood that which hath been written, “Of the ox
treading out corn the mouth thou shalt not muzzle. Doth God care for
oxen?” <span id="fr_2634"></span>[2635](#fn_2634.md) Therefore great are
those rams, great the oxen. What of the rest, that perchance are
conscious of certain sins, that perchance in the very road have slipped,
and, having been wounded, by penitence are being healed? Shall they too
continue, and to the holocausts shall they not belong? Let them not
fear, he hath added he-goats also. “I will offer to Thee oxen with
he-goats.” By the very yoking are saved the he-goats; of themselves they
have no strength, being yoked to bulls they are accepted. For they have
made friends of the mammon of iniquity, that the same may receive them
into everlasting tabernacles. <span id="fr_2635"></span>[2636](#fn_2635.md)
Therefore those he-goats shall not be on the left, because they have
made to themselves friends of the mammon of iniquity. But what he-goats
shall be on the left? They to whom shall be said, “I hungred, and ye
gave me not to eat:” <span id="fr_2636"></span>[2637](#fn_2636.md) not they
that have redeemed their sins by almsdeeds.

<span id="ii.LXVI-p77"></span>19. Come ye, hear, and I will tell, all ye
that fear God” ([Psa. 66.16](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#016.md)<span
id="ii.LXVI-p77.1"></span>). Let us come, let us hear, what he is going
to tell, “Come ye, hear, and I will tell.” But to whom, “Come ye, and
hear”? <span id="page_280">p. 280</span> <span
id="ii.LXVI-Page_280"></span>“All ye that fear God.” If God ye fear not,
I will not tell. It is not possible that it be told to any where the
fear of God is not. Let the fear of God open the ears, that there may be
something to enter in, and a way whereby may enter in that which I am
going to tell. But what is he going to tell? “How great things He hath
done to my soul.” Behold, he would tell: but what is he going to tell?
Is it perchance how widely the earth is spread, how much the sky is
extended, and how many are the stars, and what are the changes of sun
and of moon? This creation fulfilleth its course: but they have very
curiously sought it out, the Creator thereof have not known. <span
id="fr_2637"></span>[2638](#fn_2637.md) This thing hear, this thing
receive, “O ye that fear God, how great things He hath done to my soul:”
if ye will, to yours also. “How great things He hath done to my soul.”
“To Him with my mouth I have cried” ([Psa.
66.17](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#017.md)<span
id="ii.LXVI-p78.2"></span>). “And this very thing, he saith, hath been
done to his soul; that to Him with his mouth he should cry, hath been
done, he saith, to his soul. Behold, brethren, Gentiles we were, even if
not in ourselves, in our parents. And what saith the Apostle? “Ye know,
when Gentiles ye were, to idols without speech how ye went up, being
led.” <span id="fr_2638"></span>[2639](#fn_2638.md) Let the Church now say,
“how great things He hath done to my soul.” “To Him with my mouth I have
cried.” I a man to a stone was crying, to a deaf stock I was crying, to
idols deaf and dumb I was speaking: now the image of God hath been
turned to the Creator thereof. I that was “saying to a stock, My father
thou art; and to a stone, Thou hast begotten me:” <span
id="fr_2639"></span>[2640](#fn_2639.md) now say, “Our Father, which art in
Heaven.” <span id="fr_2640"></span>[2641](#fn_2640.md) …“To Him with my
mouth I have cried, and I have exalted Him under my tongue.” See how in
secret He would be uncorrupt that offereth marrowed holocausts. This do
ye, brethren, this imitate, so that ye may say, “Come ye, see how great
things He hath done to my soul.” For all those things of which he
telleth, by His Grace are done in our soul. See the other things of
which he speaketh.

<span id="ii.LXVI-p82"></span>20. “If I have beheld iniquity in my
heart, may not the Lord hearken” ([Psa.
66.18](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#018.md)<span
id="ii.LXVI-p82.1"></span>). Consider now, brethren, how easily, how
daily men blushing for fear of men do censure iniquities; He hath done
ill, He hath done basely, a villain the fellow is: this perchance for
man’s sake he saith. See whether thou beholdest no iniquity in thy
heart, whether perchance that which thou censurest in another, thou art
meditating to do, and therefore against him dost exclaim, not because he
hath done it, but because he hath been found out. Return to thyself,
within be to thyself a judge. Behold in thy hid chamber, in the very
inmost recess of the heart, where thou and He that seeth are alone,
there let iniquity be displeasing to thee, in order that thou mayest be
pleasing to God. Do not regard it, that is, do not love it, but rather
despise it, that is, contemn it, and turn away from it. Whatever
pleasing thing it hath promised to allure thee to sin; whatever grievous
thing it hath threatened, to drive thee on to evil doing; all is nought,
all passeth away: it is worthy to be despised, in order that it may be
trampled upon; not to be eyed lest it be accepted. <span
id="fr_2641"></span>[2642](#fn_2641.md) …

<span id="ii.LXVI-p84"></span>21. “Therefore God hath hearkened to me”
([Psa. 66.19](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#019.md)<span
id="ii.LXVI-p84.1"></span>). Because I have not beheld iniquity in my
heart. “And He hath listened to the voice of my prayer.” “Blessed be my
God, that hath not thrust away my supplication and His mercy from me”
([Psa. 66.20](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#020.md)<span
id="ii.LXVI-p84.2"></span>). Gather the sense from that place, where he
saith, “Come ye, hear, and I will tell you, all ye that fear God, how
great things He hath done to my soul:” <span
id="fr_2642"></span>[2643](#fn_2642.md) he hath both said the words which
ye have heard, and at the end thus he hath concluded: “Blessed be my
God, that hath not thrust away my supplication and His mercy from me.”
For thus there arriveth at the Resurrection he that speaketh, where
already we also are by hope: yea both it is we ourselves, and this voice
is ours. So long therefore as here we are, this let us ask of God, that
He thrust not from us our supplication, and His mercy, that is, that we
pray continually, and He continually pity. For many become feeble in
praying, and in the newness of their own conversion pray fervently,
afterwards feebly, afterwards coldly, afterwards negligently: as if they
have become secure. The foe watcheth: thou sleepest. The Lord Himself
hath given commandment in the Gospel, how “it behoveth men always to
pray and not to faint.” <span id="fr_2643"></span>[2644](#fn_2643.md) And
he giveth a comparison from that unjust judge, who neither feared God,
nor regarded man, whom that widow daily importuned to hear her; and he
yielded for weariness, that was not influenced by pity: and the naughty
judge saith to himself, “Though neither God I fear, nor men I regard,
even because of the weariness which this widow daily putteth upon me, I
will hear her cause, and will avenge her.” And the Lord saith, “If a
naughty judge hath done this, shall not your Father avenge His chosen,
that to Him do cry day and night? Yea, I say unto you, He shall make
judgment of them speedily.” Therefore let us not faint in prayer. Though
He putteth off what He is going to grant, He putteth it not away: being
secure of His promise, let us not faint in praying, and this is by His
goodness. Therefore he hath said, “Blessed is my God, that hath not
thrust away my supplication and His mercy from me.” <span
id="page_281">p. 281</span> <span id="ii.LXVI-Page_281"></span>When thou
hast seen thy supplication “not thrust away from thee,” be secure, that
His mercy hath not been thrust away from thee.
