<span id="ii.LXXIV-p1"></span> <span id="ii.LXXIV-p1.1"></span><span
class="c20"><span id="ii.LXXIV-p1.2"></span>Psalm LXXIV. <span
id="fr_3305"></span>[3306](#fn_3305.md) </span>

<span id="ii.LXXIV-p3"></span>1. This Psalm’s Title is, “Of the
Understanding of Asaph.” Asaph in Latin is translated congregation, in
Greek Synagogue. Let us see what this Synagogue hath understood. But let
us understand firstly Synagogue: from thence we shall understand what
the Synagogue hath understood. Every congregation is spoken of under the
general name of Synagogue: one both of beasts and of men may be called a
congregation; but here there is no congregation of beasts when we heard
“understanding.”…for this the Psalm’s Title doth prescribe, saying, “Of
the understanding of Asaph.” It is therefore a certain understanding
congregation whereof we are about to hear the voice. But since properly
Synagogue is said of the congregation of the people of Israel, so that
wheresoever we may have heard Synagogue, we are no longer wont to
understand any but the people of the Jews; let us see whether perchance
the voice in this Psalm be not of that same people. But of what sort of
Jews and of what sort of people of Israel? For they are not of the
chaff, but perchance of the grain; <span
id="fr_3306"></span>[3307](#fn_3306.md) not of the broken branches, but
perchance of those that are strengthened. “For not all that are of
Israel are Israelites.” <span id="fr_3307"></span>[3308](#fn_3307.md)
…There are therefore certain Israelites, of whom was he concerning whom
was said, “Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom guile is not.” <span
id="fr_3308"></span>[3309](#fn_3308.md) I do not say in the same manner as
we are Israelites, for we also are the seed of Abraham. For to the
Gentiles the Apostle was speaking, when he said, “Therefore the seed of
Abraham ye are, heirs according to promise.” <span
id="fr_3309"></span>[3310](#fn_3309.md) According to this therefore all we
are Israelites, that follow the footsteps of the faith of our father
Abraham. But let us understand here the voice of the Israelites in the
same manner as the Apostle saith, “For I also am an Israelite, of the
seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.” <span
id="fr_3310"></span>[3311](#fn_3310.md) Here therefore let us understand
that whereof the Prophets have spoken, “a remnant shall be saved.” <span
id="fr_3311"></span>[3312](#fn_3311.md) Of the remnant therefore saved let
us hear in this place the voice; in order that there may speak that
Synagogue which had received the Old Testament, and was intent upon
carnal promises; and by this means it came to pass that their feet were
shaken. For in another Psalm, where too the title hath Asaph, there is
said what? “How good is the God of Israel to men right in heart. But my
feet were almost moved.” <span id="fr_3312"></span>[3313](#fn_3312.md) And
as if we were saying, whence were thy feet moved? “Well nigh,” he saith,
“my steps were overthrown, because I was jealous in the case of sinners,
looking on the peace of sinners.” <span
id="fr_3313"></span>[3314](#fn_3313.md) For while according to the promises
of God belonging to the Old Testament he was looking for earthly
felicity, he observed it to abound with ungodly men; that they who
worshipped not God were enriched with those things which he was looking
for from God: and as though without cause he had served God, his feet
tottered.…But opportunely it hath chanced not by our own but by God’s
dispensation, that just now we heard out of the Gospel, that “the Law
was given by Moses, Grace and Truth came by Jesus Christ.” <span
id="fr_3314"></span>[3315](#fn_3314.md) For if we distinguish between the
two Testaments, Old and New, there are not the same Sacraments <span
id="fr_3315"></span>[3316](#fn_3315.md) nor the same promises; <span
id="fr_3316"></span>[3317](#fn_3316.md) nevertheless, the same
commandments <span id="fr_3317"></span>[3318](#fn_3317.md) for the most
part.…When examined they are either all found to be the same, or there
are scarce any in the Gospel which have not been spoken by the Prophets.
<span id="page_343">p. 343</span> <span
id="ii.LXXIV-Page_343"></span>The Commandments are the same, the
Sacraments are not the same, the Promises are not the same. Let us see
wherefore the commandments are the same; because according to these we
ought to serve God. The Sacraments are not the same, for some Sacraments
there are giving Salvation, others promising a Saviour. The Sacraments
of the New Testament give Salvation, the Sacraments of the Old Testament
did promise a Saviour. <span id="fr_3318"></span>[3319](#fn_3318.md) When
therefore thou hast now the things promised, why dost thou seek the
things promising, having now the Saviour?…God through the New Testament
hath taken out of the hands of His sons those things which are like the
playthings of boys, in order that He might give something more useful to
them growing up, on that account must He be supposed not to have given
those former things Himself. He gave both Himself. But the Law itself
through Moses was given, Grace and Truth came through Jesus
Christ: <span id="fr_3319"></span>[3320](#fn_3319.md) Grace because there
is fulfilled through love that which by the letter was being enjoined,
Truth because there is being rendered that which was promised. This
thing therefore this Asaph hath understood. In a word, all things which
to the Jews had been promised have been taken away. Where is their
kingdom? Where the Temple? Where the Anointing? Where is Priest? Where
are now the Prophets among them? From what time there came He that by
the Prophets was foretold, in that nation there is now nothing of these
things; now she hath lost things earthly, and not yet doth seek things
Heavenly.

<span id="ii.LXXIV-p18"></span>2. Thou shouldest not therefore hold fast
things earthly, although God doth bestow them.…See ye how that in
fearing to lose things earthly, the Jews slew the King of Heaven. And
what was done to them? They lost even those very things earthly: and in
the place where they slew Christ, there they were slain: and when, being
unwilling to lose the land, they slew the Giver of life, that same land
being slain they lost; and at that very time when they slew Him, in
order that by that very time they might be admonished of the reason
wherefore they suffered these things. For when the city of the Jews was
overthrown, they were celebrating the Passover, and with many thousands
of men the whole nation itself had met together for the celebration of
that festival. <span id="fr_3320"></span>[3321](#fn_3320.md) In that place
God (through evil men indeed, but yet Himself good; through unjust men,
but Himself just and justly) did so take vengeance upon them, that there
were slain many thousands of men, and the city itself was overthrown. Of
this thing in this Psalm “the understanding of Asaph” doth complain, and
in the very plaint the understanding as it were doth distinguish things
earthly from things heavenly, doth distinguish the Old Testament from
the New Testament: in order that thou mayest see through what things
thou art passing, what thou shouldest look for, what to forsake, to what
to cleave. Thus then he beginneth.

<span id="ii.LXXIV-p20"></span>3. “Wherefore hast Thou repelled us, O
God, unto the end?” ([Psa. 74.1](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#001.md)<span
id="ii.LXXIV-p20.1"></span>). “Hast repelled unto the end,” in the
person of the congregation which is properly called Synagogue.
“Wherefore hast Thou repelled us, O God, unto the end?” He censureth
not, but inquireth “wherefore,” for what purpose, because of what hast
Thou done this? What hast Thou done? “Thou hast repelled us unto the
end.” What is, “unto the end”? Perchance even unto the end of the world.
Hast Thou repelled us unto Christ, who is the End to every one
believing?  <span id="fr_3321"></span>[3322](#fn_3321.md) For, “Wherefore
hast Thou repelled us, O God, unto the end?” “Thy spirit <span
id="fr_3322"></span>[3323](#fn_3322.md) hath been wroth at the sheep of Thy
flock.” Wherefore wast Thou wroth at the sheep of Thy flock, but because
to things earthly we were cleaving, and the Shepherd we knew not?

<span id="ii.LXXIV-p23"></span>4. “Remember Thou Thy congregation, which
Thou hast possessed from the beginning” ([Psa.
74.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#002.md)<span
id="ii.LXXIV-p23.1"></span>). Can this by any means be the voice of the
Gentiles? Hath He possessed the Gentiles from the beginning? Nay, but He
hath possessed the seed of Abraham, the people of Israel even according
to the flesh, born of the Patriarchs our fathers: of whom we have become
the sons, not by coming out of their flesh, but by imitating their
faith. But those, possessed by God from the beginning, what befell them?
“Remember Thy congregation which Thou hast possessed from the beginning.
Thou hast redeemed the rod of Thine inheritance.” That same congregation
of Thine, being the rod of Thine inheritance, Thou hast redeemed. This
same congregation he hath called “the rod of the inheritance.” Let us
look back to the first thing that was done, when He willed to possess
that same congregation, delivering it from Egypt, what sign He gave to
Moses, when Moses said to Him, “What sign shall I give that they may
believe me, that Thou hast sent me? And God saith to him, What dost thou
bear in thine hand? A rod. Cast it on to the ground,” etc. <span
id="fr_3323"></span>[3324](#fn_3323.md) What doth it intimate? For this was
not done to no purpose. Let us inquire of the writings of God. To what
did the serpent persuade man? To death. <span
id="fr_3324"></span>[3325](#fn_3324.md) Therefore death is from the
serpent. If death is from the serpent, the rod in the ser<span
id="page_344">p. 344</span> <span id="ii.LXXIV-Page_344"></span>pent is
Christ in death. <span id="fr_3325"></span>[3326](#fn_3325.md) Therefore
also when by serpents in the desert they were being bitten and being
slain, the Lord commanded Moses to exalt a brazen serpent in the desert,
and admonish the people that whosoever by a serpent had been bitten,
should look thereupon and be made whole. <span
id="fr_3326"></span>[3327](#fn_3326.md) Thus also it was done: thus also
men, bitten by serpents, were made whole of the venom by looking upon a
serpent. <span id="fr_3327"></span>[3328](#fn_3327.md) To be made whole of
a serpent is a great Sacrament. What is it to be made whole of a serpent
by looking upon a serpent? It is to be made whole of death by believing
in one dead. And nevertheless Moses feared and fled. <span
id="fr_3328"></span>[3329](#fn_3328.md) What is it that Moses fled from
that serpent? What, brethren, save that which we know to have been done
in the Gospel? Christ died and the disciples feared, and withdrew from
that hope wherein they had been. <span
id="fr_3329"></span>[3330](#fn_3329.md) …But, at that time some thousands
of the Jews themselves, the crucifiers of Christ, believed: and because
they had been found at hand, they so believed as that they sold all that
they had, and the price of their goods before the feet of the Apostles
they laid. <span id="fr_3330"></span>[3331](#fn_3330.md) Because then this
thing was hidden, and the redemption of the rod of God was to be more
conspicuous in the Gentiles: he explaineth of what he saith that which
he hath said, “Thou hast redeemed the rod of Thine inheritance.” This he
hath said not of the Gentiles in whom it was evident. But of what?
“Mount Sion.” Yet even Mount Sion can be otherwise understood. “That one
which <span id="fr_3331"></span>[3332](#fn_3331.md) Thou hast dwelled in
the same.” In the place where the People was aforetime, where the Temple
was set up, where the Sacrifices were celebrated, where at that time
were all those necessary things giving promise of Christ. A promise,
when the thing promised is bestowed is now become superfluous.…

<span id="ii.LXXIV-p33"></span>5. “Lift up Thine hand upon their pride
at the end” ([Psa. 74.3](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#003.md)<span
id="ii.LXXIV-p33.1"></span>). As Thou didst repel us at the end, so
“lift up Thine hand upon the pride of them at the end.” The pride of
whom? Of those by whom Jerusalem was overthrown. But by whom was it, but
by the kings of the Gentiles? Well was the hand of Him lifted up upon
the pride of them at the end: for they too have now known Christ. “For
the end of the Law is Christ for righteousness to every one
believing.” <span id="fr_3332"></span>[3333](#fn_3332.md) How well doth he
wish for them! As if angry he is speaking, and he is seeming to speak
evil: <span id="fr_3333"></span>[3334](#fn_3333.md) and O that there would
come to pass the evil which he speaketh: nay now in the name of Christ
that it is coming to pass let us rejoice. Now they holding the sceptre
are being made subject to the Word of the Cross: now is coming to pass
that which was foretold, “there shall adore Him all the kings of the
earth, all nations shall serve Him.” <span
id="fr_3334"></span>[3335](#fn_3334.md) Now on the brows of kings more
precious is the sign of the Cross, than the jewel of a crown. “Lift up
Thine hand upon the pride of them at the end. How great things hath the
enemy of malice wrought in Thy holy places!” In those which were Thy
holy places, that is, in the temple, in the priesthood, in all those
sacraments which were at that time. In good sooth the enemy at that time
wrought. For the Gentiles at that time who did this, were worshipping
false Gods, were adoring idols, were serving demons: nevertheless they
wrought many evil things on the Saints of God. When could they if they
had not been permitted? But when would they have been permitted, unless
those holy things, at first promised, were no longer necessary, when He
that had promised was Himself holden? Therefore, “how great things hath
the enemy of malice wrought in Thy holy places!”

<span id="ii.LXXIV-p37"></span>6. “And all they have boasted, that hate
Thee” ([Psa. 74.4](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#004.md)<span
id="ii.LXXIV-p37.1"></span>). Observe the servants of demons, the
servants of idols: such as at that time the Gentiles were, when they
overthrew the temple and city of God, “and they boasted.” “In the midst
of Thy festival.” Remember what I said, that Jerusalem was overthrown at
the time when the very festival was being celebrated: at which festival
they crucified the Lord. Gathered together they raged, gathered together
they perished. “They have set signs, their own signs, and they have not
known” ([Psa. 74.5](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#005.md)<span
id="ii.LXXIV-p37.2"></span>). They had signs to place there, their
standards, their eagles, their own dragons, the Roman signs; or even
their statues which at first in the temple they placed; or perchance
“their signs” are the things which they heard from the prophets of their
demons. “And they have not known.” Have not known what? How “thou
shouldest have had no power against Me, except it had been given thee
from above.” <span id="fr_3335"></span>[3336](#fn_3335.md) They knew not
how that not on themselves honour was conferred, to afflict, to take, or
overthrow the city, but their ungodliness was made as it were the axe of
God. They were made the instrument of Him enraged, not so as to be the
kingdom of Him pacified. For God doth that which a man also ofttime
doth. Sometimes a man in a rage catcheth up a rod lying in the way,
perchance any sort of stick, he smiteth therewith his son, and then
throweth the stick into the fire and reserveth the inheritance for his
son: so sometime God through evil men doth instruct good men, and
through the tem<span id="page_345">p. 345</span> <span
id="ii.LXXIV-Page_345"></span>poral power of them that are to be
condemned He worketh the discipline of them that are to be saved. For
why do you suppose, brethren, that discipline was even thus inflicted
upon that nation, in order that it might perish utterly? How many out of
this nation did afterwards believe, how many are yet to believe? Some
are chaff, others grain; over both however there cometh in the
threshing-drag; but under one threshing-drag the one is broken up, the
other is purged. How great a good hath God bestowed upon us by the evil
of Judas the traitor! By the very ferocity of the Jews how great a good
was bestowed upon believing Gentiles! Christ was slain in order that
there might be on the Cross One for him to look to who had been stung by
the serpent. <span id="fr_3336"></span>[3337](#fn_3336.md) …

<span id="ii.LXXIV-p40"></span>7. Now let us hasten over the verses
following after the destruction of Jerusalem, for the reason that they
are both evident, and it doth not please me to tarry over the punishment
even of enemies. “As if in a forest of trees with axes, they have cut
down the doors thereof at once; with mattock and hammer they have thrown
Her down” ([Psa. 74.6](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#006.md)<span
id="ii.LXXIV-p40.1"></span>). That is, conspiring together, with firm
determination, “with mattock and hammer” they have thrown Her down.
“They have burned with fire Thy Sanctuary, they have defiled on the
ground the Tabernacle of Thy name” ([Psa.
74.7](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#007.md)<span
id="ii.LXXIV-p40.2"></span>).

<span id="ii.LXXIV-p41"></span>8. “They have said in their heart (the
kindred of them is in one)”—Have said what? “Come ye, let us suppress
the solemnities of the Lord from the land” ([Psa.
74.8](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#008.md)<span
id="ii.LXXIV-p41.1"></span>). “Of the Lord,” hath been inserted in the
person of this man, that is, in the person of Asaph. For they raging
would not have called Him the Lord whose temple they were overthrowing.
“Come ye, let us suppress all the solemnities of the Lord from the
land.” What of Asaph? What understanding hath Asaph in these words?
What? Doth he not profit even by the discipline accorded? Is not the
mind’s crookedness made straight? Overthrown were all things that were
at first: nowhere is there priest, nowhere Altar of the Jews, nowhere
victim, nowhere Temple. Is there then no other thing to be acknowledged
which succeeded this departing? Or indeed would this promissory sign
have been taken away, unless there had come that which was being
promised? Let us see therefore in this place now the understanding of
Asaph, let us see if he profiteth by tribulation. Observe what he saith:
“Our signs we have not seen, no longer is there prophet, and us He will
not know as yet” ([Psa. 74.9](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#009.md)<span
id="ii.LXXIV-p41.2"></span>). Behold those Jews who say that they are
not known as yet, that is, that they are yet in captivity, that not yet
they are delivered, do yet expect Christ. Christ will  <span
id="fr_3337"></span>[3338](#fn_3337.md) come, but He will come as Judge;
the first time to call, afterwards to sever. He will come, because He
hath come, <span id="fr_3338"></span>[3339](#fn_3338.md) and that He will
come is evident; but hereafter from above He will come. Before thee He
was, O Israel. Thou wast bruised because thou didst stumble against Him
lying down: that thou mayest not be ground to powder, observe Him coming
from above. For thus it was foretold by the prophet: “Whoever shall
stumble upon that stone shall be bruised, and upon whomsoever it shall
have come, it shall grind him to powder.” <span
id="fr_3339"></span>[3340](#fn_3339.md) He doth bruise when little, He
shall grind to powder when great. Now thy signs thou seest not, now
there is no prophet: and thou sayest, “and us He will not know as yet:”
because yourselves know not Him as yet. “No longer is there a prophet;
and us He will not know as yet.”

<span id="ii.LXXIV-p45"></span>9. “How long, O God, shall the enemy
revile?” ([Psa. 74.10](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#010.md)<span
id="ii.LXXIV-p45.1"></span>). Cry out as if forsaken, as if deserted:
cry out like a sick man, who hast chosen rather to smite the physician
than to be made whole: not as yet doth He know thee. See what He hath
done, who doth not know thee as yet. For they to whom there hath been no
preaching of Him, shall see; and they that have not heard shall
understand: and thou yet criest out, “No longer is there a prophet, and
us He will not know as yet.” <span id="fr_3340"></span>[3341](#fn_3340.md)
Where is thine understanding? “The adversary doth provoke Thy name at
the end.” <span id="fr_3341"></span>[3342](#fn_3341.md) For this purpose
the adversary doth provoke Thy name at the end, that being provoked Thou
mayest reprove, reproving Thou mayest know them at the end: or
certainly, “at the end,” in the sense of even unto the end.

<span id="ii.LXXIV-p48"></span>10. “Wherefore dost Thou turn away Thine
hand, and Thy right hand from the midst of Thy bosom unto the end?”
([Psa. 74.11](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#011.md)<span
id="ii.LXXIV-p48.1"></span>). Again, another sign which was given to
Moses. For in like manner as above from the rod was a sign, so also from
the right hand now. For when that thing had been done concerning the
rod, God gave a second sign: “thrust,” He saith, “thine hand into thy
bosom, and he thrust it: draw it forth, and he drew it forth: and it was
found white,” <span id="fr_3342"></span>[3343](#fn_3342.md) that is,
unclean. For whiteness on the skin is leprosy, <span
id="fr_3343"></span>[3344](#fn_3343.md) not fairness of complexion. For the
heritage of God itself, that is, His people, being cast out became
unclean. But what saith He to him? Draw it back into thy bosom. He drew
it back, and it was restored to its own colour. When doest Thou this,
saith this Asaph? How long dost Thou alienate Thy right hand from Thy
bosom, so that being with<span id="page_346">p. 346</span> <span
id="ii.LXXIV-Page_346"></span>out unclean it remaineth? Draw it back,
let it return to its colour, let it acknowledge the Saviour. “Wherefore
dost thou turn away Thine hand, and Thy right hand from the midst of Thy
bosom unto the end?” These words he crieth, being blind, not
understanding, and God doeth what He doeth. For wherefore came Christ?
“Blindness in part happened unto Israel, in order that the fulness of
the Gentiles might enter in, and so all Israel might be saved.” <span
id="fr_3344"></span>[3345](#fn_3344.md) Therefore now, O Asaph, acknowledge
that which hath gone before, in order that thou mayest at least follow,
if thou wast not <span id="fr_3345"></span>[3346](#fn_3345.md) able to go
before. For not in vain came Christ, or in vain was Christ slain, or in
vain did the corn fall into the ground; but it fell that it might rise
manifold. <span id="fr_3346"></span>[3347](#fn_3346.md) A serpent was
lifted up in the desert, in order that it might cure of the poison him
that was smitten. <span id="fr_3347"></span>[3348](#fn_3347.md) Observe
what was done. Do not think it to be a vain thing that He came: lest He
find thee evil, when He shall have come a second time.

<span id="ii.LXXIV-p55"></span>11. Asaph hath understood, because on the
Title of the Psalm there is, “understanding of Asaph.” And what saith
he? “But God, our King before the worlds, hath wrought Salvation in the
midst of the earth” ([Psa. 74.12](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#012.md)<span
id="ii.LXXIV-p55.1"></span>). On the one hand we cry, “No longer is
there prophet, and us He will not know as yet:” <span
id="fr_3348"></span>[3349](#fn_3348.md) but on the other hand, “our God,
our King, who is before the worlds” (for He is Himself in the beginning
of the Word <span id="fr_3349"></span>[3350](#fn_3349.md) by whom were made
the worlds), “hath wrought Salvation in the midst of the earth.” “God
therefore, our King before the worlds,” hath done what? “hath wrought
Salvation in the midst of the earth:” and I am yet crying as if
forsaken!…Now the Gentiles are awake, and we are snoring, and as though
God hath forsaken us, in dreams we are delirious. “He hath wrought
Salvation in the midst of the earth.”

<span id="ii.LXXIV-p58"></span>12. Now therefore, O Asaph, amend thyself
according to thy understanding, tell us what sort of Salvation God hath
wrought in the midst of the earth. When that earthly Salvation of yours
was overthrown, what did He do, what did He promise? “Thou didst confirm
in Thy virtue the sea” ([Psa.
74.13](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#013.md)<span
id="ii.LXXIV-p58.1"></span>). As though the nation of the Jews were as
it were dry land severed from the waves, the Gentiles in their
bitterness were the sea, and on all sides they washed about that land:
behold, “Thou hast confirmed in Thy virtue the sea,” and the land
remained thirsting for Thy rain. “Thou hast confirmed in Thy virtue the
sea, Thou hast broken in pieces the heads of dragons in the water.”
Dragons’ heads, that is, demons’ pride, wherewith the Gentiles were
possessed, Thou hast broken in pieces upon the water: for those persons
whom they were possessing, Thou by Baptism hast delivered.

<span id="ii.LXXIV-p59"></span>13. What more after the heads of dragons?
For those dragons have their chief, and he is himself the first great
dragon. And concerning him what hath He done that hath wrought Salvation
in the midst of the earth? Hear: “Thou hast broken the head of the
dragon” ([Psa. 74.14](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#014.md)<span
id="ii.LXXIV-p59.1"></span>). Of what dragon? We understand by dragons
all the demons that war under the devil: what single dragon then, whose
head was broken, but the devil himself ought we to understand? What with
him hath He done? “Thou hast broken the head of the dragon.” That is,
the beginning of sin. That head is the part which received the curse, to
wit that the seed of Eve should mark the head of the serpent. <span
id="fr_3350"></span>[3351](#fn_3350.md) For the Church was admonished to
shun the beginning of sin. Which is that beginning of sin, like the head
of a serpent? The beginning of all sin is pride. <span
id="fr_3351"></span>[3352](#fn_3351.md) There hath been broken therefore
the head of the dragon, hath been broken pride diabolical. And what with
him hath He done, that hath wrought Salvation in the midst of the earth?
“Thou hast given him for a morsel to the Ethiopian peoples.” What is
this? How do I understand the Ethiopian peoples? How but by these all
nations? And properly by black men: for Ethiopians are black. They are
themselves called to the faith who were black; the very same indeed, so
that there is said to them, “for ye were sometime darkness, but now
light in the Lord.” <span id="fr_3352"></span>[3353](#fn_3352.md) …Thence
was also that calf which the people worshipped, unbelieving, apostate,
seeking the gods of the Egyptians, forsaking Him who had delivered them
from the slavery of the Egyptians: whence there was enacted that great
Sacrament. For when Moses was thus wroth with them worshipping and
adoring the idol, <span id="fr_3353"></span>[3354](#fn_3353.md) and,
inflamed with zeal for God, was punishing temporally, in order that he
might terrify them to shun death everlasting; yet the head itself of the
calf he cast into the fire, and ground to powder, destroyed, strawed on
the water, and gave to the people to drink: so there was enacted a great
Sacrament. O anger prophetic, and mind not perturbed but enlightened! He
did what? Cast it into the fire, in order that first the form itself may
be obliterated; piece by piece grind it down, in order that little by
little it may be consumed: cast it into the water, give to the people to
drink! What is this but that the worshippers of the devil were become
the body of the same? In the same manner as men confessing Christ become
the Body of Christ; so that to them is said, “but ye are the Body of
Christ <span id="page_347">p. 347</span> <span
id="ii.LXXIV-Page_347"></span>and the members.” <span
id="fr_3354"></span>[3355](#fn_3354.md) The body of the devil was to be
consumed, and that too by Israelites was to be consumed. For out of that
people were the Apostles, out of that people the first Church.…Thus the
devil is being consumed with the loss of his members. This was figured
also in the serpent of Moses. For the magicians did likewise, and
casting down their rods they exhibited serpents: but the serpent of
Moses swallowed up the rods of all those magicians. <span
id="fr_3355"></span>[3356](#fn_3355.md) Let there be perceived therefore
even now the body of the devil: this is what is coming to pass, he is
being devoured by the Gentiles who have believed, he hath become meat
for the Ethiopian peoples. This again, may be perceived in, “Thou hast
given him for meat to the Ethiopian peoples,” how that now all men bite
him. What is, bite him? By reproving, blaming, accusing. Just as hath
been said, by way of prohibition indeed, but yet the idea expressed:
“but if ye bite and eat up one another, take heed that ye be not
consumed of one another.” <span id="fr_3356"></span>[3357](#fn_3356.md)
What is, bite and eat up one another? Ye go to law with one another, ye
detract from one another, ye heap revilings upon one another. Observe
therefore now how that with these bitings the devil is being consumed.
What man, when angry with his servant, even a heathen, would not say to
him, Satan? <span id="fr_3357"></span>[3358](#fn_3357.md) Behold the devil
given for meat. This saith Christian, this saith Jew, this saith
heathen: <span id="fr_3358"></span>[3359](#fn_3358.md) him he worshippeth,
and with him he curseth!…

<span id="ii.LXXIV-p69"></span>14. “Thou hast cleft the fountains and
torrents” ([Psa. 74.15](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#015.md)<span
id="ii.LXXIV-p69.1"></span>): in order that they might flow with the
stream of wisdom, might flow with the riches of the faith, might water
the saltness of the Gentiles, in order that they might convert all
unbelievers into the sweetness of the faith by their watering.…In some
men the Word of God becometh a well of water springing up unto life
eternal; <span id="fr_3359"></span>[3360](#fn_3359.md) but others hearing
the Word, and not so keeping it as that they live well, yet not keeping
silence with tongue, they become torrents. For they are properly called
torrents which are not perennial: for sometimes also in a secondary
sense torrent is used for river: as hath been said, “with the torrent of
Thy pleasures Thou shalt give them to drink.” <span
id="fr_3360"></span>[3361](#fn_3360.md) For that torrent shall not ever be
dried up. But torrents properly are those rivers named, which in summer
fail, but with winter rains are flooded and run. Thou seest therefore a
man sound in faith, that will persevere even unto the end, that will not
forsake God in any trial; for the sake of the truth, not for the sake of
falsehood and error, enduring all difficulties. Whence is this man so
vigorous, but because the Word hath become in him a well of water
springing up unto life eternal? <span
id="fr_3361"></span>[3362](#fn_3361.md) But the other receiveth the Word,
he preacheth, he is not silent, he runneth: but summer proveth whether
he be fountain or torrent. Nevertheless through both be the earth
watered, by Him who hath wrought Salvation in the midst of the earth:
let the fountains overflow, let the torrents run.

<span id="ii.LXXIV-p73"></span>15. “Thou hast dried up the rivers of
Etham” ([Psa. 74.15](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#015.md)<span
id="ii.LXXIV-p73.1"></span>).…What is Etham? For the word is Hebrew.
What is Etham interpreted? Strong, stout. Who is this strong and stout
one, whose rivers God drieth up? Who but that very dragon? For “no one
entereth into the house of a strong man that he may spoil his vessels,
unless first he shall have bound fast the strong man.” <span
id="fr_3362"></span>[3363](#fn_3362.md) This is that strong man on his own
virtue relying, and forsaking God: this is that strong man, who saith,
“I will set my seat by the north, and I will be like the Most
High.” <span id="fr_3363"></span>[3364](#fn_3363.md) Out of that very cup
of perverse strength he hath given man to drink. Strong they willed to
be, who thought that they would be Gods by means of the forbidden food.
Adam became strong, over whom was reproachfully said, “Behold, Adam hath
become like one of us.” <span id="fr_3364"></span>[3365](#fn_3364.md) …As
though they were strong, “to the righteousness of God they have not been
made subject.” <span id="fr_3365"></span>[3366](#fn_3365.md) Observe ye
that a man hath put out of the way his own strength, and remained weak,
needy, standing afar off, not daring even to raise his eyes to Heaven;
but smiting his breast, and saying, “O Lord, merciful be Thou to me a
sinner.” <span id="fr_3366"></span>[3367](#fn_3366.md) Now he is weak, now
he confesseth his weakness, he is not strong: dry land he is, be he
watered with fountains and torrents. They are as yet strong who rely on
their own virtue. Be their rivers dried up, let there be no advancement
in the doctrines of the Gentiles, of wizards, of astrologers, of magic
arts: for dried up are the rivers of the strong man: “Thou hast dried up
the rivers of Etham.” Let there dry up that doctrine; let minds be
flooded with the Gospel of truth.

<span id="ii.LXXIV-p79"></span>16. “Thine own is the day and Thine own
is the night” ([Psa. 74.16](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#016.md)<span
id="ii.LXXIV-p79.1"></span>). Who is ignorant of this, seeing that He
hath Himself made all these things; for by the Word were made all
things? <span id="fr_3367"></span>[3368](#fn_3367.md) To that very One
Himself who hath wrought Salvation in the midst of the earth, to Him is
said, “Thine own is the night.” Something here we ought to perceive
which belongeth to that very Salvation which He hath wrought in the
midst of the earth. “Thine own is the day.” Who are these? The
spiritual. “And Thine own is the night.” Who are these? The
carnal.…“Thou hast made perfect sun and <span id="page_348">p.
348</span> <span id="ii.LXXIV-Page_348"></span>moon:” the sun, spiritual
men, the moon, carnal men. As yet carnal he is, may he not be forsaken,
and may he too be made perfect. The sun, as it were a wise man: the
moon, as it were an unwise man: Thou hast not however forsaken. For thus
it is written, “A wise man endureth as the sun, but a foolish man as the
moon is changed.” <span id="fr_3368"></span>[3369](#fn_3368.md) What then?
Because the sun endureth, that is, because the wise man endureth as the
sun, a foolish man is changed like the moon, is one as yet carnal, as
yet unwise, to be forsaken? And where is that which hath been said by
the Apostle, “To the wise and unwise a debtor I am”? <span
id="fr_3369"></span>[3370](#fn_3369.md)

<span id="ii.LXXIV-p83"></span>17. “Thou hast made all the ends of the
earth” ([Psa. 74.17](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#017.md)<span
id="ii.LXXIV-p83.1"></span>).…Behold in what manner He hath made the
ends of the earth, that hath wrought Salvation in the midst of the
earth. “Thou hast made all the ends of the earth. Summer and spring Thou
hast made them.” Men fervent in the Spirit are the summer. Thou, I say,
hast made men fervent in the Spirit: Thou hast made also the novices in
the Faith, they are the “spring.” “Summer and Spring Thou hast made
them.” They shall not glory as if they have not received: “Thou hast
made them.”

<span id="ii.LXXIV-p84"></span>18. “Mindful be Thou of this Thy
creature” ([Psa. 74.18](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#018.md)<span
id="ii.LXXIV-p84.1"></span>). Of what creature of Thine? “The enemy hath
reviled the Lord.” O Asaph, grieve over thine old blindness in
understanding: “the enemy hath reviled the Lord.” It was said to Christ
in His own nation, “a sinner is this Man: we know not whence He is:” we
know Moses, to him spake God; this Man is a Samaritan. <span
id="fr_3370"></span>[3371](#fn_3370.md) “And the unwise people hath
provoked Thy name.” The unwise people Asaph was at that time, but not
the understanding of Asaph at that time. What is said in the former
Psalm? “As it were a beast I have become unto Thee, and I am alway with
Thee:” <span id="fr_3371"></span>[3372](#fn_3371.md) because He went not to
the gods and idols of the Gentiles. Although he knew not, being like a
beast, yet he knew again as a man. For he said, “alway I am with Thee,
like a beast:” and what afterwards in that place in the same Psalm,
where Asaph is? “Thou hast held the hand of my right hand, in Thy will
Thou hast conducted me, and with glory Thou hast taken me up.” <span
id="fr_3372"></span>[3373](#fn_3372.md) In Thy will, not in my
righteousness: by Thy gift, not by my work. Therefore here also, “the
enemy hath reviled the Lord: and the unwise people hath provoked Thy
name.” Have they all then perished? Far be it.…For even the Apostle Paul
through unbelief had been broken, and through faith unto the root he was
restored. So evidently “the unwise people provoked Thy name,” when it
was said, “If Son of God He is let Him come down from the Cross.”  <span
id="fr_3373"></span>[3374](#fn_3373.md)

<span id="ii.LXXIV-p89"></span>19. But what sayest thou, O Asaph, now in
understanding? “Deliver not to the beasts a soul confessing to Thee”
([Psa. 74.19](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#019.md)<span
id="ii.LXXIV-p89.1"></span>).…To what beasts, save to those the heads
whereof were broken in pieces upon the water? For the same devil is
called, beast, lion, and dragon. Do not, he saith, give to the Devil and
his Angels a soul confessing to Thee. Let the serpent devour, if still I
mind things earthly, if for things earthly I long, if still in the
promises of the Old Testament, after the revealing of the New, I remain.
But forasmuch as now I have laid down pride, and my own righteousness I
will not acknowledge, but Thy Grace; against me let proud beasts have no
power. “The souls of Thy poor forget Thou not unto the end.” Rich we
were, strong we were: but Thou hast dried up the rivers of Etham: no
longer we establish our own righteousness, but we acknowledge Thy Grace;
poor we are, hearken to Thy beggars. Now we do not dare to lift our eyes
to Heaven, but smiting our breasts we say, “O Lord, be Thou merciful to
me a sinner.”  <span id="fr_3374"></span>[3375](#fn_3374.md)

<span id="ii.LXXIV-p91"></span>20. “Have regard unto Thy
Testament” <span id="fr_3375"></span>[3376](#fn_3375.md) ([Psa.
74.20](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#020.md)<span
id="ii.LXXIV-p92.1"></span>). Fulfil that which Thou hast promised: the
tables we have, for the inheritance we are looking. “Have regard unto
Thy Testament,” not that old one: not for the sake of the land of Canaan
I ask, not for the sake of the temporal subduing of enemies, not for the
sake of carnal fruitfulness of sons, not for the sake of earthly riches,
not for the sake of temporal welfare: “Have regard unto Thy Testament,”
wherein Thou hast promised the kingdom of Heaven. Now I acknowledge Thy
Testament: now understanding is Asaph, no beast is Asaph, now he seeth
that which was spoken of, “Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, and I
will accomplish with the House of Israel and of Juda a new Testament,
not after the Testament which I ordered <span
id="fr_3376"></span>[3377](#fn_3376.md) with their Fathers.” <span
id="fr_3377"></span>[3378](#fn_3377.md) “Have regard unto Thy Testament:
for they that have been darkened have been filled of the earth of
unrighteous houses:” because they had unrighteous hearts. Our “houses”
are our hearts: therein gladly dwell they that are blessed with pure
heart. <span id="fr_3378"></span>[3379](#fn_3378.md) “Have regard,”
therefore, “unto Thy Testament:” and let the remnant be saved: <span
id="fr_3379"></span>[3380](#fn_3379.md) for many men that give heed to
earth are darkened, and filled with earth. For there hath entered into
their eyes dust, and it hath blinded them, and they have become dust
which the wind sweepeth from the face of the earth. <span
id="fr_3380"></span>[3381](#fn_3380.md) “They that have been darkened have
been filled of the earth of unrighteous houses.” For by giving heed to
earth they have been darkened, concerning whom there is said in another
<span id="page_349">p. 349</span> <span
id="ii.LXXIV-Page_349"></span>Psalm, “Let their eyes be blinded, that
they see not, and their back ever bow Thou down.” <span
id="fr_3381"></span>[3382](#fn_3381.md) With earth, then, “they that have
been darkened have been filled, with the earth of unrighteous houses:”
because they have unrighteous hearts.…

<span id="ii.LXXIV-p99"></span>21. “Let not the humble man be turned
away confounded” ([Psa. 74.21](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#021.md)<span
id="ii.LXXIV-p99.1"></span>). For them pride hath confounded. “The needy
and helpless man shall praise Thy name.” Ye see, brethren, how sweet
ought to be poverty: ye see that poor and helpless men belong to God,
but “poor in spirit, for of them is the Kingdom of Heaven.” <span
id="fr_3382"></span>[3383](#fn_3382.md) Who are the poor in spirit? The
humble, men trembling at the words of God, confessing their sins,
neither on their own merits, nor on their own righteousness relying. Who
are the poor in spirit? They who when they do anything of good, praise
God, when anything of evil, accuse themselves. “Upon whom shall rest My
Spirit,” saith the Prophet, “but upon the humble man, and peaceful, and
trembling at My words?” <span id="fr_3383"></span>[3384](#fn_3383.md) Now
therefore Asaph hath understood, now to the earth he adhereth not, now
the earthly promises out of the Old Testament he requireth not.…

<span id="ii.LXXIV-p102"></span>22. “Arise, O Lord, judge Thou my
cause” <span id="fr_3384"></span>[3385](#fn_3384.md) ([Psa.
74.22](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#022.md)<span
id="ii.LXXIV-p103.1"></span>).…Because I am not able to show my God, as
if I were following an empty thing, they revile me. And not only
Heathen, or Jew, or heretic; but sometimes even a Catholic brother doth
make a grimace when the promises of God are being preached, when a
future resurrection is being foretold. <span
id="fr_3385"></span>[3386](#fn_3385.md) And still even he, though already
washed with the water of eternal Salvation, bearing the Sacrament of
Christ, perchance saith, “and what man hath yet risen again?” And, “I
have not heard my father speaking out of the grave, since I buried him!”
“God hath given to His servants a law for time, to which <span
id="fr_3386"></span>[3387](#fn_3386.md) let them betake themselves: for
what man cometh back from beneath?” And what shall I do with such men?
Shall I show them what they see not? I am not able: for not for the sake
of them ought God to become visible.…I see not, he saith: what am I to
believe? Thy soul is seen then, I suppose? Fool, thy body is seen: thy
soul who doth see? Since therefore thy body alone is seen, why art thou
not buried? He marvelleth that I have said, If body alone is seen, why
art thou not buried? And he answereth (for he knoweth as much as this),
Because I am alive. How know I that thou art alive, of whom I see not
the soul? How know I? Thou wilt answer, Because I speak, because I walk,
because I work. Fool, by the operations of the body I know thee to be
living, by the works of creation canst thou not know the Creator? And
perchance he that saith, when I shall be dead, afterwards I shall be
nothing; hath both learned letters, and hath learned this doctrine from
Epicurus, who was a sort of doting philosopher, or rather lover of folly
not of wisdom, whom even the philosophers themselves have named the hog:
who said that the “chief good” was pleasure of body; this philosopher
they <span id="fr_3387"></span>[3388](#fn_3387.md) have named the hog,
wallowing in carnal mire. From him perchance this lettered man hath
learned to say, I shall not be, after I have died. Dried be the rivers
of Etham! Perish those doctrines of the Gentiles, flourish the
plantations of Jerusalem! Let them see what they can, in heart believe
what they cannot see! Certainly all those things which throughout the
world now are seen, when God was working Salvation in the midst of the
earth, when those things were being spoken of, they were not then as
yet: and behold at that time they were foretold, now they are shown as
fulfilled, and still the fool saith in his heart, “there is no
God.” <span id="fr_3388"></span>[3389](#fn_3388.md) Woe to the perverse
hearts: for so will there come to pass the things which remain, as there
have come to pass the things which at that time were not, and were being
foretold as to come to pass. Hath God indeed performed <span
id="fr_3389"></span>[3390](#fn_3389.md) to us all the things which He
promised, and concerning the Day of Judgment alone hath He deceived us?
Christ was not on the earth; He promised, He hath performed: no virgin
had conceived; He promised, He hath performed: the precious Blood had
not been shed whereby there should be effaced the handwriting of our
death; He promised, He hath performed: not yet had flesh risen again
unto life eternal; He promised, He hath performed: not yet had the
Gentiles believed; He promised, He hath performed: not yet heretics
armed with the name of Christ, against Christ were warring; He foretold,
He hath performed: not yet the idols of the Gentiles from the earth had
been effaced; He foretold, He hath performed: when all these things He
hath foretold and performed, concerning the Day of Judgment alone hath
He lied? It will come by all means as these things came; for even these
things before they came to pass were future, and as future were first
foretold, and afterwards they came to pass. It will come, my brethren.
Let no one say, it will not come: or, it will come, but far off is that
which will come. But to thyself it is near at hand to go hence.…If thou
shalt have done that which the devil doth suggest, and shalt have
despised that which God hath commanded; <span id="page_350">p.
350</span> <span id="ii.LXXIV-Page_350"></span>there will come the
Judgment Day, and thou wilt find that true which God hath threatened,
and that false which the devil hath promised.…“Remember Thy reproaches,
those which are from the imprudent man all the day long.” For still
Christ is reviled: nor will there be wanting all the day long, that is,
even unto the end of time, the vessels of wrath. Still is it being said,
“Vain things the Christians do preach:” still is it being said, “A fond
thing is the resurrection of the dead.” “Remember Thy reproaches.” But
what reproaches, save those “which are from the imprudent man all the
day long?” Doth a prudent man say this? Nay, for a prudent man is said
to be one far-seeing. If a prudent man is one far-seeing, by faith he
seeth afar: for with eyes scarce that before the feet is seen.

<span id="ii.LXXIV-p109"></span>23. “Forget not the voice of them that
implore Thee” ([Psa. 74.23](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#023.md)<span
id="ii.LXXIV-p109.1"></span>). While they groan for and expect now that
which Thou hast promised from the New Testament, and walk by that same
Faith, “do Thou not forget the voice of them imploring Thee.” But those
still say, “Where is Thy God? Let the pride of them that hate Thee come
up always to Thee.” Do not forget even their pride. Nor doth He forget:
no doubt He doth either punish or amend.
