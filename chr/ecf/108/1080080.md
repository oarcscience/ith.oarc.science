<span id="ii.LXIX-p1"></span> <span id="ii.LXIX-p1.1"></span><span
class="c20"><span id="ii.LXIX-p1.2"></span>Psalm LXIX. <span
id="fr_2895"></span>[2896](#fn_2895.md) </span>

<span id="ii.LXIX-p3"></span>1. We have been born into this world, and
added to the people of God, at that period wherein already the herb from
a grain of mustard seed hath spread out its branches; wherein already
the leaven, which at first was contemptible, hath leavened three
measures, <span id="fr_2896"></span>[2897](#fn_2896.md) that is, the whole
round world repeopled by the three sons of Noe: <span
id="fr_2897"></span>[2898](#fn_2897.md) for from East and West and North
and South shall come they that shall sit down with the Patriarchs, <span
id="fr_2898"></span>[2899](#fn_2898.md) while those shall have been driven
without, that have been born of their flesh and have not imitated their
faith. Unto his glory then of Christ’s Church our eyes we have opened;
and that barren one, for whom joy was proclaimed and foretold, because
she was to have more sons than she that had the husband, <span
id="fr_2899"></span>[2900](#fn_2899.md) her we have found to be such an one
as hath forgotten the reproaches and infamy of her widowhood: and so we
may perhaps wonder when we chance to read in any prophecy the words of
Christ’s humiliation, or our own. And it may be, that we are less
affected by them; because we have not come at that time when these
things were read with zest, in that tribulation abounded. But again if
we think of the abundance of tribulations, and observe the way wherein
we are walking (if indeed we do walk in it), how narrow it is, and how
through straits and tribulations it leadeth unto rest everlasting, <span
id="fr_2900"></span>[2901](#fn_2900.md) and how that very thing which in
human affairs is called felicity, is more to be feared than misery;
since indeed misery ofttimes doth bring out of tribulation a good fruit,
but felicity doth corrupt the soul with a perverse security, and giveth
place for the Devil the Tempter—when, I say, we shall have judged
prudently and rightly, as the salted victim <span
id="fr_2901"></span>[2902](#fn_2901.md) did, that “human life upon earth is
trial,” <span id="fr_2902"></span>[2903](#fn_2902.md) and that no one is at
all secure, nor ought to be secure, until he be come to that country,
whence no one that is a friend goeth forth, into which no one that is an
enemy is <span id="page_300">p. 300</span> <span
id="ii.LXIX-Page_300"></span>admitted, even now in the very glory of the
Church we acknowledge the voices of our tribulation: and being members
of Christ, subject to our Head in the bond of love, and mutually
supporting one another, we will say from the Psalms, that which here we
have found the Martyrs said, who were before us; that tribulation is
common to all men from the beginning even unto the end.…

<span id="ii.LXIX-p11"></span>2. The Title of the Psalm is: “Unto the
end, in behalf of those that shall be changed, to David himself.” Now of
the change for the better hear thou; for change either is for the worse
or for the better.…That we have been changed then for the worse, to
ourselves let us ascribe: that for the better we are changed, let us
praise God. “For those,” then, “that shall be changed,” this Psalm is.
But whence hath this change been made but by the Passion of Christ? The
very word Pascha in Latin is interpreted passage. For Pascha <span
id="fr_2903"></span>[2904](#fn_2903.md) is not a Greek word but a Hebrew.
It soundeth indeed in the Greek language like Passion, because <span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.LXIX-p12.1"></span> π€σχειν</span> signifieth
to suffer: but if the Hebrew expression be examined, it pointeth to
something else. Pascha doth intimate passage. Of which even John the
Evangelist hath admonished us, who (just before the Passion when the
Lord was coming to the supper wherein He set forth the Sacrament of His
Body and Blood) thus speaketh: “But when there had come the hour,
wherein Jesus was to pass from this world to the Father.” <span
id="fr_2904"></span>[2905](#fn_2904.md) He hath expressed then the
“passage” of the Pascha. But unless He passed Himself hence to the
Father, who came for our sake, how should we have been able to pass
hence, who have not come down for the sake of taking up anything, but
have fallen? But He Himself fell not; He but came down, in order that He
might raise up him that had fallen. The passage therefore both of Him
and of us is hence to the Father, from this world to the kingdom of
Heaven, from life mortal to life everlasting, from life earthly to life
heavenly, from life corruptible to life incorruptible, from intimacy
with tribulations to perpetual security. Accordingly, “In behalf of them
that shall be changed,” the Psalm’s title is. The cause therefore of our
change, that is, the very Passion of the Lord and our own voice in
tribulations in the text of the Psalm let us observe, let us join in
knowing, join in groaning, and in hearing, in joint-knowing,
joint-groaning, let us be changed, in order that there may be fulfilled
in us the Title of the Psalm, “In behalf of them that shall be changed.”

<span id="ii.LXIX-p14"></span>3. “Save me, O God, for the waters have
entered in even unto my soul” ([Psa.
69.1](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#001)<span id="ii.LXIX-p14.1"></span>.md).
That grain is despised now, that seemeth to give forth humble words. In
the garden it is buried, though the world will admire the greatness of
the herb, of which herb the seed was despised by the Jews. For in very
deed observe ye the seed of the mustard, minute, dull coloured,
altogether despicable, in order that therein may be fulfilled that which
hath been said, We have seen Him, and He had neither form nor
comeliness. <span id="fr_2905"></span>[2906](#fn_2905.md) But He saith,
that waters have come in even unto His soul; because those multitudes,
which under the name of waters He hath pointed out, were able so far to
prevail as to kill Christ.…Whence then doth He so cry out, as though He
were suffering something against His will, except because the Head doth
prefigure the Members? For He suffered because He willed: but the
Martyrs even though they willed not; for to Peter thus He foretold his
passion: “When thou shalt be old,” He saith, “another shall gird thee,
and lead thee whither thou wilt not.” <span
id="fr_2906"></span>[2907](#fn_2906.md) For though we desire to cleave to
Christ, yet we are unwilling to die: and therefore willingly or rather
patiently we suffer, because no other passage is given us, through which
we may cleave to Christ. For if we could in any other way arrive at
Christ, that is, at life everlasting, who would be willing to die? For
while explaining our nature, that is, a sort of association of soul and
body, and in these two parts a kind of intimacy of gluing and fastening
together, the Apostle saith, that “we have a House not made with hands,
everlasting in the Heavens:” <span id="fr_2907"></span>[2908](#fn_2907.md)
that is, immortality prepared for us, wherewith we are to be clothed at
the end, when we shall have risen from the dead; and he saith, “Wherein
we are not willing to be stripped, but to be clothed upon, that the
mortal may be swallowed up of life.” <span
id="fr_2908"></span>[2909](#fn_2908.md) If it might so be, we should so
will, he saith, to become immortal, as that now that same immortality
might come, and now as we are it should change us, in order that this
our mortal body by life should be swallowed up, and the body should not
be laid aside through death, so as at the end again to have to be
recovered. Although then from evil to good things we pass, nevertheless
the very passage is somewhat bitter, and hath the gall which the Jews
gave to the Lord in the Passion, hath something sharp to be endured,
whereby they are shown that gave Him vinegar to drink. <span
id="fr_2909"></span>[2910](#fn_2909.md) …For here both sweet are temporal
pleasures, and bitter are temporal tribulations: but who would not drink
the cup of tribulation temporal, fearing the fire of hell; and who would
not contemn the sweetness of the world, longing for the sweetness of
life eternal? From hence that we may be delivered let us cry: lest
perchance amidst oppressions we consent to iniquity, and truly
irreparably we be swallowed up.

<span id="ii.LXIX-p20"></span><span id="page_301">p. 301</span> <span
id="ii.LXIX-Page_301"></span>4. “Fixed I am in the clay of the deep, and
there is no substance” ([Psa.
69.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#002)<span id="ii.LXIX-p20.1"></span>.md).
What called the clay? Is it those very persons that have persecuted? For
out of clay man hath been made. <span
id="fr_2910"></span>[2911](#fn_2910.md) But these men by falling from
righteousness have become the clay of the deep, and whosoever shall not
have consented to them persecuting and desiring to draw him to iniquity,
out of his clay doth make gold. For the clay of the same shall merit to
be converted into a heavenly form, <span
id="fr_2911"></span>[2912](#fn_2911.md) and to be made associate of those
of whom saith the Title of the Psalm, “in behalf of them that shall be
changed.” But at the time when these were the clay of the deep, I stuck
in them: that is, they held Me, prevailed against Me, killed Me. “Fixed”
then “I am in the clay of the deep, and there is no substance.” What is
this, “there is no substance”? Can it be that clay itself is not a
substance? What is then, “fixed I am”? Can it be that Christ hath thus
stuck? Or hath He stuck, and was not, as hath been said in the book of
Job, “the earth delivered into the hands of the ungodly man”? <span
id="fr_2912"></span>[2913](#fn_2912.md) Was He fixed in body, because it
could be held, and suffered even crucifixion? For unless with nails He
had been fixed, crucified He had not been. Whence then “there is no
substance”? Is that clay not a substance? But we shall understand, if it
be possible, what is, “and there is no substance,” if first we shall
have understood what is a substance. For there is substance spoken of
even of riches, as we say, he hath substance, and he hath lost
substance.…

<span id="ii.LXIX-p24"></span>5. God is a sort of substance: for that
which is no substance, is nothing at all. To be a substance then is to
be something. Whence also in the Catholic Faith against the poisons of
certain heretics thus we are builded up, so that we say, Father and Son
and Holy Spirit are of one substance. What is, of one substance? For
example, if gold is the Father, gold is also the Son, gold also the Holy
Spirit. Whatever the Father is because He is God, the same is the Son,
the same the Holy Spirit. But when He is the Father, this is not what He
is. For Father He is called not in reference to Himself, but in
reference to the Son: but in reference to Himself God He is called.
Therefore in that He is God, by the same He is a substance. And because
of the same substance the Son is, without doubt the Son also is God. But
yet in that He is Father, because it is not the name of the substance,
but is referred to the Son; we do not say that the Son is Father in the
same manner as we say the Son is God. Thou askest what the Father is; we
answer, God. Thou askest what is the Father and the Son: we answer, God.
If questioned of the Father alone, answer thou God: if questioned of
both, not Gods, but God, answer thou. We do not reply as in the case of
men, when thou inquirest what is father Abraham, we answer a man; the
substance of him serveth for answer: thou inquirest what is his son
Isaac, we answer, a man; of the same substance are Abraham and Isaac:
thou inquirest what is Abraham and Isaac, we answer not man, but men.
Not so in things divine. For so great in this case is the fellowship of
substance, that of equality it alloweth, plurality alloweth not. If then
it shall have been said to thee, when thou tellest me that the Son is
the same as the Father, in fact the Son also is the Father; answer thou,
according to the substance I have told thee that the Son is the same as
the Father, not according to that term which is used in reference to
something else. For in reference to Himself He is called God, in
reference to the Father is called Son. And again, the Father in
reference to Himself is called God, in reference to the Son He is called
Father. The Father as He is called in reference to the Son, is not the
Son: the Son as He is called in reference to the Father, is not the
Father: what the Father is called in reference to Himself and the Son in
reference to Himself, the same is Father and Son, that is, God. What is
then, “there is no substance”? After this interpretation of substance,
how shall we be able to understand this passage of the Psalm, “Fixed I
am in the clay of the deep, and there is no substance”? God made
man, <span id="fr_2913"></span>[2914](#fn_2913.md) He made substance; and O
that he had continued in that which God made Him! If man had continued
in that which God made him, in him would not have been *fixed* He whom
God begot. But moreover because through iniquity man fell from the
substance wherein he was made <span id="fr_2914"></span>[2915](#fn_2914.md)
(for iniquity itself is no substance; for iniquity is not a nature which
God formed, but a perverseness which man made); the Son of God came to
the clay of the deep, and was fixed; and that was no substance wherein
He was fixed, because in the iniquity of them He was fixed. “All things
by Him were made, and without Him there was made nothing.” <span
id="fr_2915"></span>[2916](#fn_2915.md) All natures by Him were made,
iniquity by Him was not made, because iniquity was not made. <span
id="fr_2916"></span>[2917](#fn_2916.md) Those substances by Him were made,
which praise Him. The whole creation praising God is commemorated by the
three children in the furnace, <span
id="fr_2917"></span>[2918](#fn_2917.md) and from things earthly to things
heavenly, or from things heavenly to things earthly reacheth the hymn of
them praising God. Not that all these things have sense to praise; but
<span id="page_302">p. 302</span> <span
id="ii.LXIX-Page_302"></span>because all things being well meditated
upon, do beget praise, and the heart by considering creation is
fulfilled to overflowing with a hymn to the Creator. All things do
praise God, but only the things which God hath made. Do ye observe in
that hymn that covetousness praiseth God? There even the serpent
praiseth God, covetousness praiseth not. For all creeping things are
there named in the praise of God: there are named all creeping things;
but there are not there named any vices. For vices out of ourselves and
out of our own will we have: and vices are not a substance. In these was
fixed the Lord, when He suffered persecution: in the vice of the Jews,
not in the substance of men which by Him was made.

<span id="ii.LXIX-p30"></span>6. “I have come into the depth of the sea,
and the tempest hath made Me to sink down.” Thanks to the mercy of Him
who came into the depth of the sea, and vouchsafed to be swallowed by
the sea whale, but was vomited forth the third day. <span
id="fr_2918"></span>[2919](#fn_2918.md) He came into the depth of the sea,
in which depth we were thrust down, in which depth we had suffered
shipwreck: He came thither Himself, and the tempest made Him to sink
down: for there He suffered waves, those very men; tempests, the voices
of men saying, “Crucify, Crucify.” <span
id="fr_2919"></span>[2920](#fn_2919.md) Though Pilate said, I find not any
cause in this Man why He should be killed: there prevailed the voices of
them, saying, “Crucify, Crucify.” The tempest increased, until He was
made to sink down that had come into the depth of the sea. And the Lord
suffered in the hands of the Jews that which He suffered not when upon
the waters He was walking: <span id="fr_2920"></span>[2921](#fn_2920.md)
the which not only He had not suffered Himself, but had not allowed even
Peter to suffer it.

<span id="ii.LXIX-p34"></span>7. “I have laboured, crying, hoarse have
become my jaws” ([Psa. 69.3](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#003.md)<span
id="ii.LXIX-p34.1"></span>). Where was this? When was this? Let us
question the Gospel. For the Passion of our Lord in this Psalm we
perceive. And, indeed, that He suffered we know; that there came in
waters even unto His Soul, because peoples prevailed even unto His
death, we read, we believe; in the tempest that He was sunk down,
because tumult prevailed to His killing, we acknowledge: but that He
laboured in crying, and that His jaws were made hoarse, not only we read
not, but even on the contrary we read, that He answered not to them a
word, in order that there might be fulfilled that which in another Psalm
hath been said, “I have become as it were a man not hearing, and having
not in his mouth reproofs.” <span id="fr_2921"></span>[2922](#fn_2921.md)
And that which in Isaiah hath been prophesied, “like a sheep to be
sacrificed He was led, and like a lamb before one shearing Him, so He
opened not His mouth.” <span id="fr_2922"></span>[2923](#fn_2922.md) If He
became like a man not hearing, and having not in His mouth reproofs, how
did He labour crying, and how were His jaws made hoarse? Is it that He
was even then silent, because He was hoarse with having cried so much in
vain? And this indeed we know to have been His voice on the Cross out of
a certain Psalm: “O God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?” <span
id="fr_2923"></span>[2924](#fn_2923.md) But how great was that voice, or of
how long duration, that in it His jaws should have become hoarse? Long
while He cried, “Woe unto you, Scribes and Pharisees:” <span
id="fr_2924"></span>[2925](#fn_2924.md) long while He cried, “Woe unto the
world because of offences.” <span id="fr_2925"></span>[2926](#fn_2925.md)
And truly hoarse in a manner He cried, and therefore was not understood,
when the Jews said, What is this that He saith? “Hard is this saying,
who is able to hear it?” <span id="fr_2926"></span>[2927](#fn_2926.md) We
know not what He saith. He said all these words: but hoarse were His
jaws to them that understood not His words. “Mine eyes have failed from
hoping in My God.” Far be it that this should be taken of the person of
the Head: far be it that His eyes should have failed from <span
id="fr_2927"></span>[2928](#fn_2927.md) hoping in His God: in whom rather
there was God reconciling the world to Himself, <span
id="fr_2928"></span>[2929](#fn_2928.md) and Who was the Word made flesh and
dwelled in us, so that not only God was in Him, but also He was Himself
God. Not so then: the eyes of Himself, our Head, failed not from hoping
in His God: but the eyes of Him have failed in His Body, that is, in His
members. This voice is of the members, this voice is of the Body, not of
the Head. How then do we find it in His Body and members?…

<span id="ii.LXIX-p43"></span>8. Thus “there have been multiplied above
the hairs of My head they that hate Me gratis” ([Psa.
69.4](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#004)<span id="ii.LXIX-p43.1"></span>.md).
How multiplied? So as that they might add to themselves even one out of
the twelve. <span id="fr_2929"></span>[2930](#fn_2929.md) “There have been
multiplied above the hairs of My head they that hate Me for nought.”
With the hairs of His head He hath compared His enemies. With reason
they were shorn when in the place of Calvary He was crucified. <span
id="fr_2930"></span>[2931](#fn_2930.md) Let the members accept this voice,
let them learn to be hated gratis. For now, O Christian, if it must
needs be that the world hate thee, why dost thou not make it hate thee
gratis, in order that in the Body of thy Lord and in this Psalm sent
before concerning Him, thou mayest acknowledge thy own voice? How shall
it come to pass that the world hate thee gratis? If thou no wise hurtest
any one, and art still hated: for this is gratis, without cause…

<span id="ii.LXIX-p46"></span>9. “O God, Thou hast known mine
improvidence” ([Psa. 69.5](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#005.md)<span
id="ii.LXIX-p46.1"></span>). Again out of the mouth of the Body. For
what improvidence is there <span id="page_303">p. 303</span> <span
id="ii.LXIX-Page_303"></span>in Christ? Is He not Himself the Virtue of
God, and the Wisdom of God? Doth He call this His improvidence, whereof
the Apostle speaketh, “the foolishness of God is wiser than men”? <span
id="fr_2931"></span>[2932](#fn_2931.md) Mine improvidence, that very thing
which in Me they derided that seem to themselves to be wise, Thou hast
known why it was done. For what was so much like improvidence, as, when
He had it in His power with one word to lay low the persecutors, to
suffer Himself to be held, scourged, spit upon, buffeted, with thorns to
be crowned, to the tree to be nailed? It is like improvidence, it
seemeth a foolish thing; but this foolish thing excelleth all wise men.
Foolish indeed it is: but even when grain falleth into the earth, if no
one knoweth the custom of husbandmen, it seemeth foolish…Improvidence it
appeareth; but hope maketh it not to be improvidence. He then spared not
Himself: because even the Father spared Him not, but delivered Him up
for us all. <span id="fr_2932"></span>[2933](#fn_2932.md) And of the Same,
“Who loved me,” saith the Apostle, “and delivered up Himself for
me:” <span id="fr_2933"></span>[2934](#fn_2933.md) for except a grain shall
have fallen into the land so that it die, fruit, He saith, it will not
yield. <span id="fr_2934"></span>[2935](#fn_2934.md) This is the
improvidence. “And my transgressions from Thee are not concealed.” It is
plain, clear, open, that this must be perceived to be out of the mouth
of the Body. Transgressions none had Christ: He was the bearer of
transgressions, but not the committer. “Are not concealed:” that is, I
have confessed to Thee, all my transgressions, and before my mouth Thou
hast seen them in my thought, hast seen the wounds which Thou wast to
heal. But where? Even in the Body, in the members: in those believers
out of whom there was now cleaving to Him that member, who was
confessing his sins.

<span id="ii.LXIX-p51"></span>10. “Let them not blush in <span
id="fr_2935"></span>[2936](#fn_2935.md) Me, that wait for Thee, O Lord,
Lord of virtues” ([Psa. 69.6](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#006.md)<span
id="ii.LXIX-p52.1"></span>). Again, the voice of the Head, “Let them not
blush in Me:” let it not be said to them, Where is He on whom ye were
relying? Let it not be said to them, Where is He that was saying to you,
Believe ye <span id="fr_2936"></span>[2937](#fn_2936.md) in God, and in Me
believe? <span id="fr_2937"></span>[2938](#fn_2937.md) “Let them not blush
in Me, that wait for Thee,” O Lord, Lord of virtues. Let them not be
confounded concerning Me, that seek Thee, O God of Israel.” This also
may be understood of the Body, but only if thou consider the Body of Him
not one man: for in truth one man is not the Body of Him, but a small
member, but the Body is made up of members. Therefore the full Body of
Him is the whole Church. With reason then saith the Church, “Let them
not blush in Me, that wait for Thee, O Lord, Lord of virtues.”…

<span id="ii.LXIX-p55"></span>11. “For because of Thee I have sustained
upbraiding, shamelessness hath covered my face” ([Psa.
69.7](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#007)<span id="ii.LXIX-p55.1"></span>.md).
No great thing is that which is spoken of in “I have sustained:” but
that which is spoken of in “for Thy sake I have sustained,” is. For if
thou sustainest because thou hast sinned; for thine own sake thou
sustainest, not for the sake of God. For to you what glory is there,
saith Peter, if sinning ye are punished, and ye bear it? But if thou
sustainest because thou hast kept the commandment of God, truly for the
sake of God thou sustainest; and thy reward remaineth for everlasting,
because for the sake of God thou hast sustained revilings. <span
id="fr_2938"></span>[2939](#fn_2938.md) For to this end He first sustained
in order that we might learn to sustain…“Shamelessness hath covered my
face.” Shamelessness is what? Not to be confused. Lastly, it seemeth to
be as it were a fault, when we say, the man is shameless. Great is the
shamelessness of the man, that he doth not blush. Therefore
shamelessness is a kind of folly. A Christian ought to have this
shamelessness, when he cometh among men to whom Christ is an offence. If
he shall have blushed because of Christ, he will be blotted out from the
book of the living. Thou must needs therefore have shamelessness when
Thou art reviled because of Christ; when they say, Worshipper of the
Crucified, adorer of Him that died ill, venerator of Him that was slain!
here if thou shalt blush thou art a dead man. For see the sentence of
Him that deceiveth no one. “He that shall have been ashamed of Me before
men, I will also be ashamed of him before the Angels of God.”  <span
id="fr_2939"></span>[2940](#fn_2939.md) Watch therefore thyself whether
there be in thee shamelessness; be thou boldfaced, <span
id="fr_2940"></span>[2941](#fn_2940.md) when thou hearest a reproach
concerning Christ; yea be boldfaced. Why fearest thou for thy forehead
which thou hast armed with the sign of the Cross?…

<span id="ii.LXIX-p59"></span>12. “An alien I have become to My
brethren, and a stranger to the sons of My mother” ([Psa.
69.8](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#008)<span id="ii.LXIX-p59.1"></span>.md).
To the sons of the Synagogue He became a stranger…Why so? Why did they
not acknowledge? Why did they call Him an alien? Why did they dare to
say, we know not whence He is? “Because the zeal of Thine House hath
eaten Me up:” that is, because I have persecuted in them their own
iniquities, because I have not patiently borne those whom I have
rebuked, because I have sought Thy glory in Thy House, because I have
scourged them that in the Temple dealt unseemly: <span
id="fr_2941"></span>[2942](#fn_2941.md) in which place also there is
quoted, “the zeal of Thine House hath eaten Me up.” Hence an alien,
hence a Stranger; hence, we know not whence He is. They would have
acknowledged <span id="page_304">p. 304</span> <span
id="ii.LXIX-Page_304"></span>whence I am, if they had acknowledged that
which Thou hast commanded. For if I had found them keeping Thy
commandments, the zeal of Thine House would not have eaten Me up. “And
the reproaches of men reproaching Thee have fallen upon Me.” Of this
testimony Paul the Apostle hath also made use (there hath been read but
now the very lesson), and saith, “Whatsoever things aforetime have been
written, have been written that we might be instructed.” <span
id="fr_2942"></span>[2943](#fn_2942.md) …Why “Thee”? Is the Father
reproached, and not Christ Himself? Why have “the reproaches of men
reproaching Thee fallen upon Me”? Because, “he that hath known Me, hath
known the Father also:” <span id="fr_2943"></span>[2944](#fn_2943.md)
because no one hath reviled Christ without reviling God: because no one
honoureth the Father, except he that honoureth the Son also. <span
id="fr_2944"></span>[2945](#fn_2944.md)

<span id="ii.LXIX-p64"></span>13. “And I have covered in fasting My
Soul, and it became to Me for a reviling” ([Psa.
69.10](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#010.md)<span
id="ii.LXIX-p64.1"></span>). His fasting was, when there fell away all
they that had believed in Him; because also it was His hunger, that men
should believe in Him: because also it was His thirst, when He said to
the woman, I thirst, “give Me to drink:” <span
id="fr_2945"></span>[2946](#fn_2945.md) yea for her faith He was thirsting.
And from the Cross when He was saying, “I thirst,” <span
id="fr_2946"></span>[2947](#fn_2946.md) He was seeking the faith of them
for whom He had said, “Father, forgive them, for they know not what they
do.” <span id="fr_2947"></span>[2948](#fn_2947.md) But what did those men
give to drink to Him thirsty? Vinegar. Vinegar is also called
*old*. <span id="fr_2948"></span>[2949](#fn_2948.md) With reason of the old
man they gave to drink, because they willed not to be new. Why willed
they not to become new? Because to the title of this Psalm whereon is
written, “For them that shall be changed,” they belonged not. Therefore,
“I have covered in fasting My Soul.” Lastly, He put from Him even the
gall which they offered: He chose rather to fast than to accept
bitterness. For they enter not into His Body that are embittered,  <span
id="fr_2949"></span>[2950](#fn_2949.md) whereof in another place a Psalm
saith, “They that are embittered shall not be exalted in
themselves.” <span id="fr_2950"></span>[2951](#fn_2950.md) Therefore, “I
have covered in fasting My Soul: and it became to Me for a reviling.”
This very thing became to Me for a reviling, that I consented not to
them, that is, from them I fasted. For he that consenteth not to men
seducing to evil, fasteth from them; and through this fasting earneth
reviling, so that he is upbraided because he consenteth not to the evil
thing.

<span id="ii.LXIX-p71"></span>14. “And I have set sackcloth my garment”
([Psa. 69.11](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#011.md)<span
id="ii.LXIX-p71.1"></span>). Already before <span
id="fr_2951"></span>[2952](#fn_2951.md) we have said something of the
sackcloth, from whence there is this, “But I, when they were troubling
Me, was covering myself with sackcloth, and was humbling My Soul in
fasting. I have set sackcloth for My garment:” that is, have set against
them My flesh, on which to spend their rage, I have concealed My
divinity. “Sackcloth,” because mortal the flesh was: in order that by
sin He might condemn sin in the flesh. <span
id="fr_2952"></span>[2953](#fn_2952.md) “And I have set sackcloth my
garment: and I have been made to them for a parable,” that is, for a
derision. It is called a parable, whenever a comparison is made
concerning some one, when he is evil spoken of. “So may this man
perish,” for example, “as that man did,” is a parable: that is, a
comparison and likeness in cursing. “I have been made to them,” then,
“for a parable.”

<span id="ii.LXIX-p74"></span>15. “Against Me were reviling they that
were sitting in the gate” ([Psa.
69.12](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#012.md)<span
id="ii.LXIX-p74.1"></span>). “In the gate” is nothing else but in
public. “And against Me they were chanting, <span
id="fr_2953"></span>[2954](#fn_2953.md) they that were drinking wine.” Do
ye think, brethren, that this hath befallen Christ alone? Daily to Him
in His members it happeneth: whenever perchance it is necessary for the
servant of God to forbid excess of wine and luxuries in any village or
town, where there hath not been heard the Word of God, it is not enough
that they sing, nay more even against him they begin to sing, by whom
they are forbidden to sing. Compare ye now His fasting and their wine.

<span id="ii.LXIX-p76"></span>16. “But I with My prayer with Thee, <span
id="fr_2954"></span>[2955](#fn_2954.md) O Lord” ([Psa.
69.13](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#013.md)<span
id="ii.LXIX-p77.1"></span>). But I was with Thee. But how? With Thee by
praying. For when thou art evil spoken of, and knowest not what thou
mayest do; when at thee are hurled reproaches, and thou findest not any
way of rebuking him by whom they are hurled; nothing remaineth for thee
but to pray. But remember even for that very man to pray. “But I with my
prayer with Thee, O Lord. It is the time of Thy good pleasure, O God.”
For behold the grain is being buried, there shall spring up fruit. “It
is the time of Thy good pleasure, O God.” Of this time even the Prophets
have spoken, whereof the Apostle maketh mention: “Behold now the time
acceptable, behold now the day of salvation.” <span
id="fr_2955"></span>[2956](#fn_2955.md) “It is the time of Thy good
pleasure, O God. In the multitude of Thy mercy.” This is the time of
good pleasure, “in the multitude of Thy mercy.” For if there were not a
multitude of Thy mercy, what should we do for the multitude of our
iniquity? “In the multitude of Thy mercy; Hearken to me in the truth of
Thy Salvation.” Because He hath said, “of Thy mercy,” he hath added
truth also: for “mercy and truth” are all the ways of the Lord.  <span
id="fr_2956"></span>[2957](#fn_2956.md) Why mercy? In forgiving sins. Why
truth? In fulfilling the promises.

<span id="ii.LXIX-p80"></span>17. “Save Thou Me from the mire, that I
<span id="page_305">p. 305</span> <span id="ii.LXIX-Page_305"></span>may
not stick” ([Psa. 69.14](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#014.md)<span
id="ii.LXIX-p80.1"></span>). From that whereof above he had spoken,
“Fixed I am in the clay of the deep, and there is no substance.” <span
id="fr_2957"></span>[2958](#fn_2957.md) Furthermore, since ye have duly
received the exposition of that expression, in this place there is
nothing further for you to hear particularly. From hence he saith that
he must be delivered, wherein before he said that he was fixed: “Save
Thou Me from the mire, that I may not stick.” And he explaineth this
himself: “Let Me be rescued from them that hate Me.” They were
themselves therefore the clay wherein he had stuck. But the following
perchance suggesteth itself. A little before he had said, Fixed I am;
now he saith, Save Thou Me from the mire, that I may not stick:” whereas
after the meaning of what was said before he ought to have said, Save
Thou Me from the mire where I had stuck, by rescuing Me, not by causing
that I stick not. Therefore He had stuck in flesh, but had not stuck in
spirit. He saith this, because of the infirmity of His members. Whenever
perchance thou art seized by one that urgeth thee to iniquity, thy body
indeed is taken, in regard to the body thou art fixed in the clay of the
deep: but so long as thou consentest not, thou hast not stuck; but if
thou consentest, thou hast stuck. Let then thy prayer be in that place,
in order that as thy body is now held, so thy soul may not be held, so
thou mayest be free in bonds.

<span id="ii.LXIX-p82"></span>18. “Let not the tempest of waters drown
Me” ([Psa. 69.15](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#015.md)<span
id="ii.LXIX-p82.1"></span>). But already he had been drowned. “I have
come into the depth of the sea,” thou hast said, and “the tempest hath
drowned Me,” <span id="fr_2958"></span>[2959](#fn_2958.md) thou hast said.
It hath drowned after the flesh, let it not drown after the Spirit. They
to whom was said, If they shall have persecuted you in one city, flee ye
into another; <span id="fr_2959"></span>[2960](#fn_2959.md) had this said
to them, that neither in flesh they should stick, nor in spirit. For we
must not desire to stick even in flesh; but as far as we are able we
ought to avoid it. But if we shall have stuck, and shall have fallen
into the hands of sinners: then in body we have stuck, we are fixed in
the clay of the deep, it remaineth to entreat for the soul that we stick
not, that is, that we consent not, that the tempest of water drown us
not, so that we go into the deep of the clay. “Neither let the deep
swallow Me, nor the pit close her mouth upon Me.” What is this,
brethren? What hath he prayed against? Great is the pit of the depth of
human iniquity: every one, if he shall have fallen into it, will fall
into the deep. But yet if a man being there placed confesseth his sins
to his God, the pit will not shut her mouth upon him: as is written in
another Psalm, “From the depths I have cried to Thee, O Lord; Lord,
hearken unto my voice.”  <span id="fr_2960"></span>[2961](#fn_2960.md) But
if there is done in him that which another passage of Scripture saith,
“When a sinner shall have come into the depth of evil things, he will
despise,” <span id="fr_2961"></span>[2962](#fn_2961.md) upon him the pit
hath shut her mouth. Why hath she shut her mouth? Because she hath shut
his mouth. He hath lost confession, really dead he is, and there is
fulfilled in him that which elsewhere is spoken of, “From a dead man, as
from one that is not, there perisheth confession.” <span
id="fr_2962"></span>[2963](#fn_2962.md) …

<span id="ii.LXIX-p88"></span>19. “Hearken unto me, O Lord, for sweet is
Thy mercy” ([Psa. 69.16](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#016.md)<span
id="ii.LXIX-p88.1"></span>). He hath given this as a reason why He ought
to be hearkened unto, because sweet is the mercy of God.…To a man set in
trouble the mercy of God must needs be sweet. Concerning this sweetness
of the mercy of God see ye what in another place the Scripture saith:
“Like rain in drought, so beautiful is the mercy of God in
trouble.” <span id="fr_2963"></span>[2964](#fn_2963.md) That which there he
saith to be “beautiful,” the same he saith here to be “sweet.” Not even
bread would be sweet, unless hunger had preceded. Therefore even when
the Lord permitteth or causeth us to be in any trouble, even then He is
merciful: for He doth not withdraw nourishment, but stirreth up longing.
Accordingly what saith he now, “Hearken to me, O Lord, for sweet is Thy
mercy”? Now do not Thou defer hearkening, in so great trouble I am, that
sweet to me is Thy mercy. For to this end Thou didst defer to succour,
in order that to me that wherewith Thou didst succour might be sweet:
but now no longer is there cause why Thou must defer; my trouble hath
arrived at the appointed measure of distress, let Thy mercy come to do
the work of goodness. “After the multitude of Thy pities have regard
unto me:” not after the multitude of my sins.

<span id="ii.LXIX-p90"></span>20. “Turn not away Thy face from Thy
child” <span id="fr_2964"></span>[2965](#fn_2964.md) ([Psa.
69.17](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#017.md)<span
id="ii.LXIX-p91.1"></span>). And this is a commending of humility; “from
Thy child,” that is, “from Thy little one:” because now I have been rid
of pride through the discipline of tribulation, “turn not away Thy face
from Thy child.” This is that beautiful mercy of God, whereof he spake
above. For in the following verse he explaineth that whereof he spake:
“For I am troubled, speedily hearken Thou unto me.” What is “speedily”?
Now there is no cause why Thou must defer it: I am troubled, my
affliction hath gone before; let Thy mercy follow.

<span id="ii.LXIX-p92"></span>21. “Give heed to my soul, and redeem
her,” doth need no exposition: let us see therefore what followeth.
“Because of mine enemies deliver me” ([Psa.
69.18](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#018.md)<span
id="ii.LXIX-p92.1"></span>). This petition is evidently wonderful,
neither briefly to be touched upon, nor hastily to be skipped over;
truly wonderful: “Because of mine enemies deliver me.” What <span
id="page_306">p. 306</span> <span id="ii.LXIX-Page_306"></span>is,
“Because of mine enemies deliver me”?…I see no reason for this petition,
“Because of mine enemies deliver me:” unless we understand it of
something else, which when I shall have spoken by the help of the Lord,
He shall judge in you, that dwelleth in you. <span
id="fr_2965"></span>[2966](#fn_2965.md) There is a kind of secret
deliverance of holy men: this for their own sakes is made. There is one
public and evident: this is made because of their enemies, either for
their punishment, or for their deliverance. For truly God delivered not
the brothers in the book of Maccabees from the fires of the
persecutor. <span id="fr_2966"></span>[2967](#fn_2966.md) …But again the
Three Children openly were delivered from the furnace of fire; <span
id="fr_2967"></span>[2968](#fn_2967.md) because their body also was
rescued, their safety was public. The former were in secret crowned, the
latter openly delivered: all however saved.…There is then a secret
deliverance, there is an open deliverance. Secret deliverance doth
belong to the soul, open deliverance to the body as well. For in secret
the soul is delivered, openly the body. Again, if so it be, in this
Psalm the voice of the Lord let us acknowledge: to the secret
deliverance doth belong that whereof he spake above, “Give heed to my
soul, and redeem her.” There remaineth the body’s deliverance: for on
His arising and ascending into the Heavens, and sending the Holy Ghost
from above, there were converted to His faith they that at His death did
rage, and out of enemies they were made friends through His grace, not
through their righteousness. <span id="fr_2968"></span>[2969](#fn_2968.md)
Therefore he hath continued, “Because of mine enemies deliver me. Give
heed to my soul,” but this in secret: but “because of mine enemies
deliver” even my body. For mine enemies it will profit nothing if soul
alone Thou shalt have delivered; that they have done something, that
they have accomplished something, they will believe. “What profit is
there in my blood, while I go down into corruption?” <span
id="fr_2969"></span>[2970](#fn_2969.md) Therefore “give heed to my soul,
and redeem her,” which Thou alone knowest: secondly also, “because of
mine enemies deliver me,” that my flesh may not see corruption.

<span id="ii.LXIX-p98"></span>22. “Thou knowest my reproach, and my
confusion, and my shame” ([Psa.
69.19](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#019.md)<span
id="ii.LXIX-p98.1"></span>). What is reproach? What is confusion? What
shame? Reproach is that which the enemy casteth in the teeth. Confusion
is that which gnaweth the conscience. Shame is that which causeth even a
noble brow to blush, because of the upbraiding with a pretended crime.
There is no crime; or even if there is a crime, it doth not belong to
him, against whom it is alleged: but yet the infirmity of the human mind
ofttimes is made ashamed even when a pretended crime is alleged; not
because it is alleged, but because it is believed. All these things are
in the Body of the Lord. For confusion in Him could not be, in whom
guilt was not found. There was alleged as a crime against Christians,
the very fact that they were Christians. That indeed was glory: the
brave gladly received it, and so received it as that they blushed not at
all for the Lord’s name. For fearlessness had covered the face of them,
having the effrontery of Paul, saying, “for I blush not because of the
Gospel: for the virtue of God it is for salvation to every one
believing.” <span id="fr_2970"></span>[2971](#fn_2970.md) O Paul, art not
thou a venerator of the Crucified? Little it is, he saith, for me not to
blush for it: nay, therein alone I glory, wherefore the enemy thinketh
me to blush. “But from me far be it to glory, save in the Cross of Jesus
Christ, through whom to me the world is crucified, and I to the
world.” <span id="fr_2971"></span>[2972](#fn_2971.md) At such a brow as
this then reproach alone could be hurled. For neither could there be
confusion in a conscience already made whole, nor shame in a brow so
free. But when it was being alleged against certain that they had slain
Christ, deservedly they were pricked through with evil conscience, and
to their health confounded and converted, so that they could say, “Thou
hast known my confusion.” Thou therefore, O Lord, hast known not only my
reproach but also my confusion, in certain shame also: who, though in me
they believe, publicly blush to confess me before ungodly men, human
tongue having more influence with them than promise divine. Behold ye
therefore them: even such are commended to God, not that so He may leave
them, but that by aiding them He may make them perfect. For a certain
man believing and wavering hath said, “I believe, O Lord, help Thou mine
unbelief.” <span id="fr_2972"></span>[2973](#fn_2972.md)

<span id="ii.LXIX-p102"></span>23. “In Thy sight are all they that
trouble Me” ([Psa. 69.20](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#020.md)<span
id="ii.LXIX-p102.1"></span>). Why I have reproach, Thou knowest; why
confusion, Thou knowest; why shame, Thou knowest: therefore deliver Thou
me because of mine enemies, because Thou knowest these things of me,
they know not; and thus, because they are themselves in Thy sight, not
knowing these things, they will not be able to be either confounded or
corrected, unless openly Thou shalt have delivered me because of mine
enemies. “Reproach my heart hath expected, and misery.” What is, “hath
expected”? Hath foreseen these things as going to be, hath foretold them
as going to be. For He came not for any other purpose. If He had been
unwilling to die, neither would He have willed to be born: for the sake
of resurrection He did both. For there were two particular things known
to us among mankind, but one thing unknown. For we knew that men were
born and died: that they rose again and lived for everlasting we <span
id="page_307">p. 307</span> <span id="ii.LXIX-Page_307"></span>knew not.
That He might show to us that which we knew not, He took upon Him the
two things which we knew. To this end therefore He came. “Reproach my
heart hath expected and misery.” But the misery of whom? For He expected
misery, but rather of the crucifiers, rather of the persecutors, that in
them should be misery, in Him mercy. For pitying the misery of them even
while hanging on the Cross, He saith, “Father, forgive them, for they
know not what they do.” <span id="fr_2973"></span>[2974](#fn_2973.md) What
then did it profit, that I expected? That is, what did it profit that I
foretold? What did it profit that I said to this end I had come? I came
to fulfil that which I said, “I waited for one that together should be
made sorrowful, and there was not; and men comforting, and I found not:”
that is, there was none. For that which in the former verse He said, “I
waited for one that together should be made sorrowful,” the same is in
the following verse, “and men comforting.” But that which in the former
verse is, “and there was not;” the same in the following verse is, “and
I found not.” Therefore another sentence is not added, but the former is
repeated. Which sentence if we reconsider, a question may arise. For
were His disciples nowise made sorrowful when He was led to the Passion,
when on the tree hanged, when dead? So much were they made sorrowful,
that Mary Magdalene, who first saw Him, rejoicing told them as they were
mourning what she had seen. <span id="fr_2974"></span>[2975](#fn_2974.md)
The Gospel speaketh of these things: it is not our presumption, not our
suspicion: it is evident that the disciples grieved, it is evident that
they mourned. Strange women were weeping, when to the Passion He was
being led, unto whom turning He saith, “Weep ye, but for yourselves, do
not for Me.” <span id="fr_2975"></span>[2976](#fn_2975.md) … Peter
certainly loved very much, and without hesitation threw himself to walk
on the waves, <span id="fr_2976"></span>[2977](#fn_2976.md) and at the
voice of the Lord he was delivered: and though following Him when led to
the Passion, with the boldness of love, yet being troubled, thrice he
denied Him. Whence, except because an evil thing it seemed to him to
die? For he was shunning that which he thought an evil thing. This then
even in the Lord he was lamenting, which he was himself shunning. On
this account even before he had said, “Far be it from Thee, O Lord,
merciful be Thou to Thyself: there shall not come to pass this
thing:” <span id="fr_2977"></span>[2978](#fn_2977.md) at which time he
merited to hear, “Satan;” after that he had heard, “Blessed art thou,
Simon Bar-jona.” Therefore in that sorrowfulness which the Lord felt
because of those for whom He prayed, “Father, forgive them, for they
know not what they do:” <span id="fr_2978"></span>[2979](#fn_2978.md) no
companion He found. “And I waited for one that together should be made
sorrowful, and there was not.” There was not at all. “And men
comforting, and I found not.” Who are men comforting? Men profiting. For
they comfort us, they are the comfort of all preachers of the Truth.

<span id="ii.LXIX-p109"></span>24. “And they gave for My food gall, and
in My thirst they gave Me vinegar to drink” ([Psa.
69.22](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#022.md)<span
id="ii.LXIX-p109.1"></span>). This was done indeed to the letter. And
the Gospel declareth this to us. But we must understand, brethren, that
the very fact that I found not comforters, that the very fact that I
found not one that together should be made sorrowful, this was My gall,
this to Me was bitter, this was vinegar: bitter because of grief,
vinegar because of their old man. For we read, that to Him indeed gall
was offered, as the Gospel speaketh; but for drink, not for food. <span
id="fr_2979"></span>[2980](#fn_2979.md) Nevertheless, we must so take and
consider that when fulfilled, which here had been before predicted,
“They gave for My food gall:” and in that very action, not only in this
saying, we ought to seek for a mystery, at secret things to knock, to
enter the rent veil of the Temple, to see there a Sacrament, both in
what there hath been said and in what there hath been done. “They gave,”
He saith, “for My food gall:” not the thing itself which they gave was
food, for it was drink: but “for food they gave it.” Because already the
Lord had taken food, and into it there had been thrown gall. But He had
taken Himself pleasant food, when He ate the Passover with His
disciples: therein He showed the Sacrament of His Body. <span
id="fr_2980"></span>[2981](#fn_2980.md) Unto this food so pleasant, so
sweet, of the Unity of Christ, of which the Apostle maketh mention,
saying, “For one bread, One Body, being many we are;” <span
id="fr_2981"></span>[2982](#fn_2981.md) unto this pleasant food who is
there that addeth gall, except the gainsayers of the Gospel, like those
persecutors of Christ? For less the Jews sinned in crucifying Him
walking on earth, than they that despise Him sitting in Heaven. That
which then the Jews did, in giving above the food which He had already
taken that bitter draught to drink, the same they do that by evil living
bring scandal upon the Church: the same do embittered heretics, “But let
them not be exalted in their own selves.” <span
id="fr_2982"></span>[2983](#fn_2982.md) They give gall after so delectable
meat. But what doth the Lord? He admitteth them not to His Body. In this
mystery, when they presented gall, the Lord Himself tasted, and would
not drink. <span id="fr_2983"></span>[2984](#fn_2983.md) If we did not
suffer them, neither at all should we taste: but because it is necessary
to suffer them, we must needs taste. But because in the members of
Christ such sort cannot be, they can be tasted, received into the <span
id="page_308">p. 308</span> <span id="ii.LXIX-Page_308"></span>Body they
cannot be. “And they gave for My food gall, and in My thirst they gave
Me vinegar to drink.” I was thirsting, and vinegar I received: that is,
for the faith of them I longed, and I found oldness.

<span id="ii.LXIX-p115"></span>25. “Let the table of them be made in
their own presence for a trap” ([Psa.
69.23](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#023.md)<span
id="ii.LXIX-p115.1"></span>). Like the trap which for Me they set, in
giving Me such a draught, let such a trap be for them. Why then, “in
their own presence”? “Let the table of them be made for a trap,” would
have been sufficient. They are such as know their iniquity, and in it
most obstinately do persevere: in their own presence there is made a
trap for them. These are they that, being too destructive, “go down into
Hell alive.” <span id="fr_2984"></span>[2985](#fn_2984.md) Lastly, of
persecutors what hath been said? Except that the Lord were in us,
perchance alive they had swallowed us up. <span
id="fr_2985"></span>[2986](#fn_2985.md) What is alive? Consenting to them,
and knowing that we ought not to consent to them. Therefore in their own
presence there is made a trap, and they are not amended. Even though in
their own presence there is a trap, let them not fall into it. Behold
they know the trap, and thrust out foot, and bow their necks to be
caught. How much better were it to turn away from the trap, to
acknowledge sin, to condemn error, to be rid of bitterness, to pass over
into the Body of Christ, to seek the Lord’s glory! But so much
prevaileth presumption of mind, that even in their own presence the trap
is, and they fall into it. “Let the eyes of them be darkened, that they
see not,” <span id="fr_2986"></span>[2987](#fn_2986.md) followeth here:
that whereas without benefit they have seen, it may chance to them even
not to see. “Let the table of them,” therefore, “be made in their own
presence for a trap.” It is not from one wishing, but from one
prophesying: not in order that it may come to pass, but because it will
come to pass. This we have often remarked, and ye ought to remember it:
lest that which the prescient mind saith in the Spirit of God, it should
seem with ill will to imprecate.…Let it then be done to them, “both for
a requital and for a stumbling-block.” And is this by any means unjust?
It is just. Why? For it is “for a requital.” For not anything would
happen to them, which was not owed. “For a requital” it is done, “and
for a stumbling-block:” for they are themselves a stumbling-block to
themselves. “Let the eyes of them be darkened, that they see not, and
the back of them alway bow Thou down” ([Psa.
69.24](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#024.md)<span
id="ii.LXIX-p118.2"></span>). This is a consequence. For they, whose
eyes have been darkened that they see not, it followeth, must have their
back bowed down. How so? Because when they have ceased to take knowledge
of things above, they must needs think of things below. He that well
heareth, “lift up the heart,” a bowed back hath not. For with stature
erect he looketh for the hope laid up for him in Heaven; most especially
if he send before him his treasure, whither his heart followeth. <span
id="fr_2987"></span>[2988](#fn_2987.md) But, on the other hand, they
perceive not the hope of future life; already being blinded, they think
of things below: and this is to have a bowed back: from which disorder
the Lord delivered that woman. For Satan hath bound her eighteen years,
and her that was bowed down <span id="fr_2988"></span>[2989](#fn_2988.md)
He raised up: <span id="fr_2989"></span>[2990](#fn_2989.md) and because on
the Sabbath He did it, the Jews were scandalized; suitably were they
scandalized at her being raised up, themselves being bowed. “Pour forth
upon them Thine anger, and let the indignation of Thine anger overtake
them” ([Psa. 69.25](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#025.md)<span
id="ii.LXIX-p121.2"></span>), are plain words: but nevertheless, in
“overtake them” we perceive them as it were fleeing. But whither are
they to flee? Into Heaven? Thou art there. Into Hell? Thou art present.
Their wings they will not take to fly straight: <span
id="fr_2990"></span>[2991](#fn_2990.md) “Let the indignation of Thine anger
overtake them,” let it not permit them to escape.

<span id="ii.LXIX-p123"></span>26. “Let the habitation of them become
forsaken” <span id="fr_2991"></span>[2992](#fn_2991.md) ([Psa.
69.26](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#026.md)<span
id="ii.LXIX-p124.2"></span>). This is now evident. For in the same
manner as He hath mentioned not only a secret deliverance of His,
saying, “Give heed to My soul, and redeem her;” <span
id="fr_2992"></span>[2993](#fn_2992.md) but also one open after the body,
adding, “because of mine enemies deliver me:” so also to these men He
foretelleth how there are to be certain secret misfortunes, whereof a
little before He was speaking.…For the blindness of the Jews was secret
vengeance: but the open was what? “Let their habitation become forsaken,
and in their tabernacles let there not be any one to inhabit.” There
hath come to pass this thing in the very city Jerusalem, wherein they
thought themselves mighty in crying against the Son of God, “Crucify,
Crucify;” <span id="fr_2993"></span>[2994](#fn_2993.md) and in prevailing
because they were able to kill Him that raised dead men. How mighty to
themselves, how great, they seemed! There followed afterwards the
vengeance of the Lord, stormed was the city, utterly conquered the Jews,
slain were I know not how many thousands of men. No one of the Jews is
permitted to come thither now: where they were able to cry against the
Lord, there by the Lord they are not permitted to dwell. They have lost
the place of their fury: and O that even now they would know the place
of their rest! What profit to them was Caiaphas in saying, <span
id="fr_2994"></span>[2995](#fn_2994.md) “If we shall have let go this man
thus, there will come <span id="page_309">p. 309</span> <span
id="ii.LXIX-Page_309"></span>the Romans, and take away from us both
place and kingdom”? <span id="fr_2995"></span>[2996](#fn_2995.md) Behold,
both they did not let Him go alive, and He liveth: and there have come
the Romans, and have taken from them both place and kingdom. But now we
heard, when the Gospel was being read, “Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how often
would I have gathered together thy sons, as a hen her chickens under her
wings, and thou wouldest not? Behold there is left to you your house
forsaken.” <span id="fr_2996"></span>[2997](#fn_2996.md) …

<span id="ii.LXIX-p130"></span>27. Why so? “For Him whom Thou hast
smitten they have themselves persecuted, and upon the pain of my wounds
they have added” ([Psa. 69.27](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#027.md)<span
id="ii.LXIX-p130.1"></span>). How then have they sinned if they have
persecuted one by God smitten? What sin is ascribed to their mind?
Malice. For the thing was done in Christ which was to be. To suffer
indeed He had come, and He punished him through whom He suffered. For
Judas the traitor was punished, and Christ was crucified: but us He
redeemed by His blood, and He punished him in the matter of his price.
For he threw down the price of silver, for which by him the Lord had
been sold; <span id="fr_2997"></span>[2998](#fn_2997.md) and he knew not
the price wherewith he had himself by the Lord been redeemed. <span
id="fr_2998"></span>[2999](#fn_2998.md) This thing was done in the case of
Judas. But when we see that there is a sort of measure of requital in
all men, and that not any one can be suffered to rage more than he hath
received power to do: how have they “added,” or what is that smiting of
the Lord? Without doubt He is speaking in the person of him from whom He
had received a body, from whom He had taken unto Him flesh, that is in
the person of mankind, of Adam himself who was smitten with the first
death because of his sin. <span id="fr_2999"></span>[3000](#fn_2999.md)
Mortal therefore here are men born, as born with their punishment: to
this punishment they add, whosoever do persecute men. For now here man
would not have had to die, unless God had smitten him. Why then dost
thou, O man, rage more than this? Is it little for a man that some time
he is to die? Each one of us therefore beareth his punishment: to this
punishment they would add that persecute us. This punishment is the
smiting of the Lord. For the Lord smote man with the sentence: “What day
ye shall have touched it,” He saith, “with death ye shall die.” <span
id="fr_3000"></span>[3001](#fn_3000.md) Out of this death He had taken upon
Him flesh, and our old man hath been crucified together with Him. <span
id="fr_3001"></span>[3002](#fn_3001.md) By the voice of that man He hath
said these words, “Him whom Thou hast smitten they have themselves
persecuted, and upon the pain of My wounds they have added.” Upon what
pain of wounds? Upon the pain of sins they have themselves added. For
sins He hath called His wounds. But do not look to the Head, consider
the Body; according to the voice whereof hath been said by the Same in
that Psalm, wherein He showed there was His voice, because in the first
verse thereof He cried from the Cross, “God, My God, look upon Me, why
hast Thou forsaken Me?” <span id="fr_3002"></span>[3003](#fn_3002.md) There
in continuation He saith, “Afar from My safety are the words of Mine
offences.”…

<span id="ii.LXIX-p137"></span>28. “Lay Thou iniquity upon their
iniquity” ([Psa. 69.28](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#028.md)<span
id="ii.LXIX-p137.1"></span>). What is this? Who would not be afraid? To
God is said, “Lay Thou iniquity upon their iniquity.” Whence shall God
lay iniquity? For hath He iniquity to lay? For we know that to be true
which hath been spoken through Paul the Apostle, “What then shall we
say? Is there anywise iniquity with God? Far be it.” <span
id="fr_3003"></span>[3004](#fn_3003.md) Whence then, “Lay Thou iniquity
upon iniquity”? How must we understand this? May the Lord be with us,
that we may speak, and because of your weariness may be able to speak
briefly. Their iniquity was that they killed a just Man: there was added
another, that they crucified the Son of God. Their raging was as though
against a man: but “if they had known, the Lord of Glory they had never
crucified.” <span id="fr_3004"></span>[3005](#fn_3004.md) They with their
own iniquity willed to kill as it were a man: there was laid iniquity
upon their own iniquity, so that the Son of God they should crucify. Who
laid this iniquity upon them? He that said, “Perchance they will
reverence My Son,” <span id="fr_3005"></span>[3006](#fn_3005.md) Him I will
send. For they were wont to kill servants sent to them, to demand rent
and profit. He sent the Son Himself, in order that Him also they might
kill. He laid iniquity upon their own iniquity. And these things did God
do in wrath, or rather in just requital? For, “May it be done to them,”
He saith, “for a requital and for a stumbling-block.” <span
id="fr_3006"></span>[3007](#fn_3006.md) They had deserved to be so blinded
as not to know the Son of God. And this God did, laying iniquity upon
their iniquity; not in wounding, but in not making whole. For in like
manner as thou increasest a fever, increasest a disorder, not by adding
disorder, but by not relieving: so because they were of such sort as
that they merited not to be healed, in their very naughtiness in a
manner they advanced; as it is said, “But evil men and wicked doers
advance for the worse:”  <span id="fr_3007"></span>[3008](#fn_3007.md) and
iniquity is laid upon their own iniquity. “And let them not enter
in <span id="fr_3008"></span>[3009](#fn_3008.md) Thy righteousness.” This
is a plain thing.

<span id="ii.LXIX-p144"></span>29. “Let them be blotted out from the
book of the living” ([Psa. 69.29](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#029.md)<span
id="ii.LXIX-p144.1"></span>). For had they been some time written
therein? Brethren, we must not so take it, as that God writeth any one
in <span id="page_310">p. 310</span> <span
id="ii.LXIX-Page_310"></span>the book of life, and blotteth him out. If
a man said, “What I have written I have written,” <span
id="fr_3009"></span>[3010](#fn_3009.md) concerning the title where it had
been written, “King of the Jews:” doth God write any one, and blot him
out? He foreknoweth, He hath predestined all before the foundation of
the world that are to reign with His Son in life everlasting. <span
id="fr_3010"></span>[3011](#fn_3010.md) These He hath written down, these
same the Book of Life doth contain. Lastly, in the Apocalypse, what
saith the Spirit of God, when the same Scripture was speaking of the
oppressions that should be from Antichrist? “There shall give
consent <span id="fr_3011"></span>[3012](#fn_3011.md) to him all they that
have not been written in the book of life.” <span
id="fr_3012"></span>[3013](#fn_3012.md) So then without doubt they will not
consent that have been written. How then are these men blotted out from
that book wherein they were never written? This hath been said according
to their own hope, because they thought of themselves that they were
written. What is, “let them be blotted out from the book of life”? Even
to themselves let it be evident, that they were not there. By this
method of speaking hath been said in another Psalm, “There shall fall
from Thy side a thousand, and tens of thousands from on Thy right
hand:” <span id="fr_3013"></span>[3014](#fn_3013.md) that is, many men
shall be offended, even out of that number who thought that they would
sit with Thee, even out of that number who thought that they would stand
at Thy right hand, being severed from the left-hand goats: <span
id="fr_3014"></span>[3015](#fn_3014.md) not that when any one hath there
stood, he shall afterwards fall, or when any one with Him hath sat, he
shall be cast away; but that many men were to fall into scandal, who
already thought themselves to be there, that is, many that thought that
they would sit with Thee, many that hoped that they would stand at the
right hand, will themselves fall. So then here also they that hoped as
though by the merit of their own righteousness themselves to have been
written in the book of God, they to whom is said, “Search the
Scriptures, wherein ye think yourselves to have life eternal:” <span
id="fr_3015"></span>[3016](#fn_3015.md) when their condemnation shall have
been brought even to their own knowledge, shall be effaced from the book
of the living, they shall know themselves not to be there. For the verse
which followeth, explaineth what hath been said: “And with just men let
them not be written.” I have said then “Let them be effaced,” according
to their hope: but according to Thy justice I say what?

<span id="ii.LXIX-p152"></span>30. “Poor and sorrowful I am” ([Psa.
69.30](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#030.md)<span
id="ii.LXIX-p152.1"></span>). Why this? Is it that we may acknowledge
that through bitterness of soul this poor One doth speak evil? For He
hath spoken of many things to happen to them. And as if we were saying
to Him, “Why such things?”—“Nay, not so much!” He answereth, “poor and
sorrowful I am.” They have brought Me to want, unto this sorrow they
have set Me down, therefore I say these words. It is not, however, the
indignation of one cursing, but the prediction of one prophesying. For
He was intending to recommend to us certain things which hereafter He
saith of His poverty and His sorrow, in order that we may learn to be
poor and sorrowful. For, “Blessed are the poor, for theirs is the
kingdom of Heaven.” <span id="fr_3016"></span>[3017](#fn_3016.md) And,
“Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted.” This
therefore He doth Himself before now show to us: and so, “poor and
sorrowful I am.” The whole Body of Him saith this. The Body of Christ in
this earth is poor and sorrowful. But let Christians be rich. Truly if
Christians they are, they are poor; in comparison with the riches
celestial for which they hope, all their gold they count for sand. “And
the health of Thy countenance, O God, hath taken Me up.” Is this poor
One anywise forsaken? When dost thou deign to bring near to thy table a
poor man in rags? But again, this poor One the health of the countenance
of God hath taken up: in His countenance He hath hidden His need. For of
Him hath been said, “Thou shalt hide them in the hiding place of Thy
countenance.” <span id="fr_3017"></span>[3018](#fn_3017.md) But in that
countenance what riches there are would ye know? Riches here give thee
this advantage, that thou mayest dine on what thou wilt, whenever thou
wilt: but those riches, that thou mayest never hunger. “The health of
Thy countenance, O God, hath taken Me up.” For what purpose? In order
that no longer I may be poor, no longer sorrowful? “I will praise the
name of the Lord with a song, I will magnify Him in praise” ([Psa.
69.31](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#031.md)<span
id="ii.LXIX-p154.2"></span>). Now it hath been said, this poor One
praiseth the name of the Lord with a song, he magnifieth Him in praise.
When would He have ventured to sing, unless He had been refreshed from
hunger? “I will magnify Him with praise.” O vast riches! What jewels of
God’s praise hath he brought out of his inward treasures! These are my
riches! “The Lord hath given, the Lord hath taken away.” <span
id="fr_3018"></span>[3019](#fn_3018.md) Then miserable he hath remained?
Far be it. See the riches: “As it hath pleased the Lord, so hath been
done, be the name of the Lord blessed.”

<span id="ii.LXIX-p156"></span>31. “And it shall please God:” that I
shall praise Him, shall please: “above a new calf, bearing horns and
hoofs.” More grateful to Him shall be the sacrifice of praise than the
sacrifice of a calf. “The sacrifice of praise shall glorify me.” <span
id="fr_3019"></span>[3020](#fn_3019.md) “Immolate to God the sacrifice of
praise.” <span id="fr_3020"></span>[3021](#fn_3020.md) So then His praise
going forth from my mouth shall please God more than a great <span
id="page_311">p. 311</span> <span id="ii.LXIX-Page_311"></span>victim
led up to His altar.…Therefore above this calf my praising shall please
Thee, such as hereafter will be, after poverty and sorrow, in the
eternal society of Angels, where neither adversary there shall be in
battle to be tossed, nor sluggard from earth to be stirred up. “Let the
needy see and rejoice” ([Psa.
69.32](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#032.md)<span
id="ii.LXIX-p158.2"></span>). Let them believe, and in hope be glad. Let
them be more needy, in order that they may deserve to be filled: lest
while they belch out pride’s satiety, there be denied them the bread
whereon they may healthily live. “Seek the Lord,” ye needy, hunger ye
and thirst; <span id="fr_3021"></span>[3022](#fn_3021.md) for He is Himself
the living bread that came down from Heaven. <span
id="fr_3022"></span>[3023](#fn_3022.md) “Seek ye the Lord, and your soul
shall live.” Ye seek bread, that your flesh may live: the Lord seek ye,
that your soul may live. <span id="fr_3023"></span>[3024](#fn_3023.md)

<span id="ii.LXIX-p162"></span>32. “For the Lord hath hearkened to the
poor” ([Psa. 69.33](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#033.md)<span
id="ii.LXIX-p162.1"></span>). He hath hearkened to the poor, and He
would not have hearkened to the poor, unless they were poor. Wilt thou
be hearkened to? Poor be thou: let sorrow cry out from thee, and not
fastidiousness. “And His fettered ones He hath not despised.” Being
offended at His servants, He hath put them in fetters: but them crying
from the fetters He hath not despised. What are these fetters?
Mortality, the corruptibleness of the flesh are the fetters wherewith we
have been bound. And would ye know the weight of these fetters? Of them
is said, “The body which is corrupted weigheth down the soul.” <span
id="fr_3024"></span>[3025](#fn_3024.md) Whenever men in the world will to
be rich, for these fetters they are seeking rags. But let the rags of
the fetters suffice: seek so much as is necessary for keeping off want,
but when thou seekest superfluities, thou longest to load thy fetters.
In such a prison then let the fetters abide even alone. “Sufficient for
the day be the evil thereof.” <span id="fr_3025"></span>[3026](#fn_3025.md)
“Let there praise Him heavens and earth, sea and all things creeping in
them” ([Psa. 69.34](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#034.md)<span
id="ii.LXIX-p164.2"></span>). The true riches of this poor man are
these, to consider the creation, and to praise the Creator. “Let there
praise Him heavens and earth, sea and all things creeping therein.” And
doth this creation alone praise God, when by considering of it God is
praised?

<span id="ii.LXIX-p165"></span>33. Hear thou another thing also: “for
God shall save Sion” ([Psa. 69.35](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#035.md)<span
id="ii.LXIX-p165.1"></span>). He restoreth His Church, the faithful
Gentiles He doth incorporate with His Only-Begotten; He beguileth not
them that believe in Him of the reward of His promise. “For God shall
save Sion; and there shall be builded the cities of Juda.” These same
are the Churches. Let no one say, when shall it come to pass that there
be builded the cities of Juda? O that thou wouldest acknowledge the
Edifice, and be a living stone, that thou mightest enter into Her. Even
now the cities of Juda are being built. For Juda is interpreted
confession. By confession of humility there are being builded the cities
of Juda: in order that there may remain without the proud, who blush to
confess. “For God shall save Sion.” What Sion? Hear in the following
words: “and the seed of His servants shall possess Her, and they that
love His name shall dwell therein” ([Psa.
69.36](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#036.md)<span
id="ii.LXIX-p165.2"></span>).…
