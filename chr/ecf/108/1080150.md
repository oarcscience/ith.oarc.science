<span id="ii.CXIX.xx"></span>

<span id="ii.CXIX.xx-p1"></span> *<span class="c2"><span
id="ii.CXIX.xx-p1.1"></span>Resch.</span>*

<span id="ii.CXIX.xx-p2"></span>151. Let no man, set in Christ’s body,
imagine these words to be alien from himself, since in truth it is the
whole body of Christ placed in this humble state that speaketh: “O
consider my humiliation, and deliver me: for I forget not Thy law”
([Psa. 119.153](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#153)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xx-p2.1"></span>). In this place we cannot understand any
law of God so suitably, as that whereby it is immutably determined that
“every one that exalteth himself, shall be abased; and every one that
humbleth himself; shall be exalted.” <span
id="fr_5355"></span>[5356](#fn_5355)

<span id="ii.CXIX.xx-p4"></span>152. “Avenge Thou,” he saith, “my cause,
and deliver me” ([Psa. 119.154](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#154)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xx-p4.1"></span>). The former sentence is here almost
repeated. And what is there said, “For I do not forget Thy law,” agreeth
with what we read here, “Quicken me, according to Thy word.” For these
words are the law of God, which he hath not forgot, so that he hath
abased himself, and will therefore be exalted. But the words, “Quicken
me,” pertain to this very exaltation; for the exaltation of the saints
is everlasting life.

<span id="ii.CXIX.xx-p5"></span>153. “Health,” he saith, “is far from
the ungodly: for they regard not Thy righteousnesses” ([Psa.
119.155](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#155)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xx-p5.1"></span>). This separateth thee, that what they have
not done, thou hast done, that is, thou hast regarded the
righteousnesses of God. But “what hast thou that thou hast not
received?” <span id="fr_5356"></span>[5357](#fn_5356) Art thou not he
who a little before didst say, “I will keep Thy righteousnesses”? Thou
therefore hast received from Him, unto whom thou didst call, the power
to keep them. He therefore doth Himself separate thee from those from
whom health is far, because they have not regarded the righteousnesses
of God.

<span id="ii.CXIX.xx-p7"></span>154. This he saw himself also. For I
should not see it, save I saw it in Him, save I were in Him. For these
are the words of the Body of Christ, whose members we are. He saw this,
I say, and at once added, “Great are Thy mercies, O Lord” ([Psa.
119.156](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#156)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xx-p7.1"></span>). Even our seeking out Thy righteousnesses,
then, cometh of Thy <span id="page_586">p. 586</span> <span
id="ii.CXIX.xx-Page_586"></span>mercies. “Quicken me according to Thy
judgment.” For I know that Thy judgments will not be upon me without Thy
mercy.

<span id="ii.CXIX.xx-p8"></span>155. “Many there are that trouble me,
and persecute me; yet do I not swerve from Thy testimonies” ([Psa.
119.157](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#157)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xx-p8.1"></span>). This hath been realized: we know it, we
recollect it, we acknowledge it. The whole earth has been crimsoned by
the blood of Martyrs; heaven is flowery with the crowns of Martyrs, the
Churches are adorned with the memorials of Martyrs, seasons
distinguished by the birthdays of Martyrs, cures more frequent  <span
id="fr_5357"></span>[5358](#fn_5357) by the merits of Martyrs. Whence
this, save because that hath been fulfilled which was prophesied <span
id="fr_5358"></span>[5359](#fn_5358) of that Man who hath been spread
abroad around the whole world. We recognize this, and render thanks to
the Lord our God. For thou, man, thou hast thyself said in another
Psalm, “If the Lord Himself had not been on our side, they would have
swallowed us up quick.” <span id="fr_5359"></span>[5360](#fn_5359)
Behold the reason why thou hast not swerved from His testimonies, and
hast won the palm of thy heavenly calling amid the hands of the many who
persecuted and troubled thee.

<span id="ii.CXIX.xx-p12"></span>156. “I have seen,” he saith, “the
foolish, and I pined” ([Psa.
119.158](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#158)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xx-p12.1"></span>): or, as other copies read, “I have seen
them that keep not covenant:” this is the reading of most. But who are
they who have not kept covenant, save they who have swerved from the
testimonies of God, not bearing the tribulation of their many
persecutors? Now this is the covenant, that he who shall have conquered
shall be crowned. They who, not bearing persecution, have by denial
swerved from the testimonies of God, have not kept the covenant. These
then the Psalmist saw, and pined, for he loved them. For that jealousy
is good, springing from love, not from envy. He addeth in what respect
they had failed to keep the covenant, “Because they kept not Thy word.”
For this they denied in their tribulations.

<span id="ii.CXIX.xx-p13"></span>157. And he commendeth himself as
differing from them, and saith, “Behold, how I have loved Thy
commandments” ([Psa. 119.159](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#159)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xx-p13.1"></span>). He saith not, I have not denied Thy
words or testimonies, as the Martyrs were urged to do, and, when they
refused, suffered intolerable torments: but he said this wherein is the
fruit of all sufferings; for, “if I give up my body to be burned, and
have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.” <span
id="fr_5360"></span>[5361](#fn_5360) The Psalmist, praising this virtue,
saith, “Behold, how I have loved Thy commandments.” Then he asketh his
reward, “O Lord, quicken me, according to Thy mercy.” These put me to
death, do Thou quicken me. But if a reward be asked of mercy, which
justice is bound to give; how much greater is that mercy, which enabled
him to gain the victory, on account of which the reward was sought for?

<span id="ii.CXIX.xx-p15"></span>158. “The beginning,” he saith, “of Thy
words is truth; all the judgments of Thy righteousness endure for
evermore” ([Psa. 119.160](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#160)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xx-p15.1"></span>). From truth, he saith, Thy words do
proceed, and they are therefore truthful, and deceive no man, for in
them life is announced to the righteous, punishment to the ungodly.
These are the everlasting judgments of God’s righteousness.
