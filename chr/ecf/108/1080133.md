<span id="ii.CXIX.iii"></span>

<span id="ii.CXIX.iii-p1"></span> *<span class="c2"><span
id="ii.CXIX.iii-p1.1"></span>Gimel.</span>*

<span id="ii.CXIX.iii-p2"></span>15. He had said, “Wherewithal shall a
young man cleanse his way? Even by keeping Thy words.” Behold he now
more openly asketh aid that he may do this: “Reward,” he saith, “Thy
servant: let me live, and keep Thy word” ([Psa.
119.17](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#017)<span
id="ii.CXIX.iii-p2.1"></span>)…It this reward that he asketh, who saith,
“Reward Thy servant.” For there are four modes of reward: either evil
for evil, as God will reward everlasting fire to the unrighteous; or
good for good, as He will reward an everlasting kingdom to the
righteous; or good for evil, as Christ by grace justifieth the ungodly;
or evil for good, as Judas and the Jews through their wickedness
persecuted Christ. Of these four modes of reward, the first two belong
to justice, whereby evil is rewarded for evil, good for good; the third
to mercy, whereby good is rewarded for evil; the fourth God knoweth not,
for to none doth He reward evil for good. But that which I have placed
third in order, is in the first instance necessary: for unless God
rewarded good for evil, there would be none to whom He could reward good
for good.…

<span id="ii.CXIX.iii-p3"></span>16. Nowhere then let human pride raise
itself up: God giveth good rewards unto His own gifts.…

<span id="ii.CXIX.iii-p4"></span>17. “Open Thou mine eyes, and I will
consider wondrous things of Thy law” ([Psa.
119.18](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#018)<span
id="ii.CXIX.iii-p4.1"></span>). What he addeth, “I am a lodger upon
earth” ([Psa. 119.19](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#019)<span
id="ii.CXIX.iii-p4.2"></span>): or, as some copies read, “I am a
sojourner upon earth, O hide not Thy commandments from me,” hath the
same meaning.…

<span id="ii.CXIX.iii-p5"></span>18. Here an important question ariseth
respecting the soul. For the words, I am a sojourner, or lodger, or
stranger upon earth, <span id="fr_5146"></span>[5147](#fn_5146) cannot
seem to have been said in reference to the body, since the body derives
its origin from <span id="page_563">p. 563</span> <span
id="ii.CXIX.iii-Page_563"></span>the earth. But in this most profound
question I dare not define anything. For if it might justly have been
said in respect of the soul (which God forbid we should suppose derived
from the earth), “I am a lodger,” or “stranger upon earth;” or in
reference to the whole man, since he was at one time an inhabitant of
Paradise, where he who spake these words was not; or, what is more free
from all controversy, if it be not every man who could say this, but one
to whom an everlasting country hath been promised in heaven: this I
know, “that the life of man on earth is a temptation;” <span
id="fr_5147"></span>[5148](#fn_5147) and that “there is a heavy yoke
upon the sons of Adam.” <span id="fr_5148"></span>[5149](#fn_5148) But
it pleaseth me more to discuss the question in accordance with this
construction, that we say we are tenants or strangers upon earth,
because we have found our country above, whence we have received a
pledge, and where when we have arrived we shall never depart. <span
id="fr_5149"></span>[5150](#fn_5149) …

<span id="ii.CXIX.iii-p10"></span>19. Those whose conversation <span
id="fr_5150"></span>[5151](#fn_5150) is in heaven, as far as they abide
here conversant, are in truth strangers. Let them pray therefore that
the commandments of God may not be hidden from them, whereby they may be
freed from this temporary sojourn, by loving God, with whom they will be
for evermore; and by loving their neighbour, that he may be there where
they also themselves will be.

<span id="ii.CXIX.iii-p12"></span>20. But what is loved by loving, if
love itself be not loved? Whence by consequence that stranger upon
earth, after praying that the commandments of God might not be hidden
from him, wherein love is enjoined either solely or principally;
declareth that he desireth to have a love for love itself, saying, “My
soul hath coveted to have a desire alway after Thy judgments” ([Psa.
119.20](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#020)<span
id="ii.CXIX.iii-p12.1"></span>). This coveting is worthy of praise, not
of condemnation.…

<span id="ii.CXIX.iii-p13"></span>21. But he saith not, “coveteth,”
only; but, “My soul hath coveted to desire Thy judgments.” For there is
no obstacle to possessing the judgments of God, save that they are not
desired, while love hath no warmth toward winning them, though their
light is so clear and shining.…

<span id="ii.CXIX.iii-p14"></span>22. “Thou hast rebuked the proud: and
cursed are they that do err from Thy commandments” ([Psa.
119.21](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#021)<span
id="ii.CXIX.iii-p14.1"></span>). For the proud err from the commandments
of God. For it is one thing not to fulfil the commandments of God
through infirmity or ignorance; another to err from them through pride;
as they have done, who have begotten us in our mortal state unto these
evils.…But consider now, after saying, “Thou hast rebuked the proud,” he
saith not, Cursed are they that have erred from Thy commandments; so
that only that sin of the first men should come into the mind; but he
saith, “Cursed are they that do err.” For it was needful that all might
be terrified by that example, that they might not err from the divine
commandments, and by loving righteousness in all time, recover in the
toil of this world, what we lost in the pleasure of Paradise.

<span id="ii.CXIX.iii-p15"></span>23. “O turn from me shame and rebuke;
for I have sought out Thy testimonies” ([Psa.
119.22](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#022)<span
id="ii.CXIX.iii-p15.1"></span>). Testimonies are called in Greek <span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.CXIX.iii-p15.2"></span>μαρτύρια</span>, which
word we now use for the Latin word: whence those who on account of their
testimony to Christ have been brought low by various sufferings, and
have contended unto death for the truth, are not called *testes,* but by
the Greek term Martyrs.  <span id="fr_5151"></span>[5152](#fn_5151)
Since then ye hear in this term one more familiar and grateful, let us
take these words as if it were said, “O turn from me shame and rebuke;
because I have sought out Thy martyrdoms.” When the body of Christ
speaketh thus, doth it consider it any punishment to hear rebuke and
shame from the ungodly and the proud, since it rather reacheth the crown
by this means? Why then doth it pray that it should be removed from it
as something heavy and insupportable, save because, as I said, it
prayeth for its very enemies, to whom it seeth it is destructive, to
cast the holy name of Christ as a reproach to Christians.…For my
enemies, whom Thou enjoinest to be loved by me, who more and more die
and are lost, when they despise Thy martyrdoms and accuse them in me,
will indeed be recalled to life and be found, if they reverence Thy
martyrdoms in me. Thus it hath happened: this we see. Behold, martyrdom
in the name of Christ, both with men and in this world, is not only not
a disgrace, but a great ornament: behold, not only in the sight of the
Lord, but in the sight of men, “precious is the death of His
Saints;” <span id="fr_5152"></span>[5153](#fn_5152) behold, His martyrs
are not only not despised, but honoured with great distinctions.…

<span id="ii.CXIX.iii-p18"></span>24. “Princes also did sit and speak
against me: but Thy servant is exercised in Thy statutes” ([Psa.
119.23](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#023)<span
id="ii.CXIX.iii-p18.1"></span>). Thou who desirest to know what sort of
exercise this was, understand what he hath added, “For Thy testimonies
are my meditation, and Thy statutes are my counsellors” ([Psa.
119.24](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#024)<span
id="ii.CXIX.iii-p18.2"></span>). Remember what I have above instructed
you, that testimonies are acts of martyrdom. Remember that among the
statutes of the Lord there is none more difficult and more worthy of
admiration, than that every man should love his enemies. <span
id="fr_5153"></span>[5154](#fn_5153) Thus then the body of Christ was
exercised, so that it meditated on the acts of martyrdom that testified
of Him, and loved those from whom, while they rebuked and despised the
Church for these very martyrdoms, she suffered persecutions.…
