XXV](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#000.md)<span id="ii.XXV-p1.1"></span><span
class="c20"><span id="ii.XXV-p1.2"></span>. <span
id="fr_632"></span>[633](#fn_632.md) </span>

<span id="ii.XXV-p3"></span>*To the end, a psalm of David
himself.* <span id="fr_633"></span>[634](#fn_633.md)

<span id="ii.XXV-p5"></span>1. Christ speaks, but in the person of the
Church: for what is said has reference rather to the Christian People
turned unto God.

<span id="ii.XXV-p6"></span>2. “Unto Thee, O Lord, have I lift up my
soul” ([Psa. 25.1](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#001.md)<span
id="ii.XXV-p6.1"></span>): with spiritual longing have I lift up the
soul, that was trodden down on the earth with carnal longings. “O my
God, in Thee I trust, I shall not be ashamed” ([Psa.
25.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#002)<span id="ii.XXV-p6.2"></span>.md). O
my God, from trusting in myself I was brought even to this weakness of
the flesh; and I who on abandoning God wished to be as God, fearing
death from the smallest insect, was in derision ashamed for my pride;
now, therefore, “in Thee I trust, I shall not be ashamed.”

<span id="ii.XXV-p7"></span>3. “And let not my enemies mock me.” And let
them not mock me, who by ensnaring me with serpent-like and secret
suggestions, and prompting me with “Well done, well done,” have brought
me down to this. “For all that wait upon Thee shall not be confounded”
([Psa. 25.3](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#003.md)<span
id="ii.XXV-p7.1"></span>).

<span id="ii.XXV-p8"></span>4. “Let them be confounded who do vain
things unrighteously.” Let them be confounded who act unrighteously for
the acquiring things that pass away. “Make Thy ways, O Lord, known to
me, and teach me Thy paths” ([Psa.
25.4](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#004)<span id="ii.XXV-p8.1"></span>.md):
not those which are broad, and lead the many to destruction; <span
id="fr_634"></span>[635](#fn_634.md) but Thy paths, narrow, and known to
few, teach Thou me.

<span id="ii.XXV-p10"></span>5. “In Thy truth guide me:” avoiding error.
“And teach me:” for by myself I know nothing, but falsehood. “For Thou
art the God of my salvation; and for Thee have I waited all the day”
([Psa. 25.5](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#005.md)<span
id="ii.XXV-p10.1"></span>). For dismissed by Thee from Paradise, and
having taken my journey into a far country, <span
id="fr_635"></span>[636](#fn_635.md) I cannot by myself return, unless Thou
meetest the wanderer: for my return hath throughout the whole tract of
this world’s time waited for Thy mercy.

<span id="ii.XXV-p12"></span>6. “Remember Thy compassions, O Lord”
([Psa. 25.6](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#006.md)<span
id="ii.XXV-p12.1"></span>). Remember the works of Thy mercy, O Lord; for
men deem of Thee as though Thou hadst forgotten. “And that Thy mercies
are from eternity.” And remember this, that Thy mercies are from
eternity. For Thou never wast without them, who hast subjected even
sinful man to vanity indeed, but in hope; <span
id="fr_636"></span>[637](#fn_636.md) and not deprived him of so many and
great consolations of Thy creation.

<span id="ii.XXV-p14"></span>7. “Remember not the offences of my youth
and of my ignorance” ([Psa. 25.7](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#007.md)<span
id="ii.XXV-p14.1"></span>). The offences of my presumptuous boldness and
of my ignorance reserve not for vengeance, but let them be as if
forgotten by Thee. “According to Thy mercy, be mindful of me, O God.” Be
mindful indeed of me, not according to the anger of which I am worthy,
but according to Thy mercy which is worthy of Thee. “For Thy goodness, O
Lord.” Not for my deservings, but for Thy goodness, O Lord.

<span id="ii.XXV-p15"></span>8. “Gracious and upright is the Lord”
([Psa. 25.8](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#008.md)<span
id="ii.XXV-p15.1"></span>). The Lord is gracious, since even sinners and
the ungodly He so pitied, as to forgive all that is past; but the Lord
is upright too, who after the mercy of vocation and pardon, which is of
grace without merit, will require merits meet for the last judgment.
“Wherefore He will establish a law for them that fail in the way.” For
He hath first bestowed mercy to bring them into the way.

<span id="ii.XXV-p16"></span>9. “He will guide the meek in judgment.” He
will guide the meek, and will not confound in the judgment those that
follow His will, and do not, in withstanding It, prefer their own. “The
gentle He will teach His ways” ([Psa.
25.9](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#009)<span id="ii.XXV-p16.1"></span>.md).
He will teach His ways, not to those that desire to run before, as if
they were better able to rule themselves; but to those who do not exalt
the neck, nor lift the heel, when the easy yoke and the light burden is
laid upon them. <span id="fr_637"></span>[638](#fn_637.md)

<span id="ii.XXV-p18"></span>10. “All the ways of the Lord are mercy and
truth” ([Psa. 25.10](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#010.md)<span
id="ii.XXV-p18.1"></span>). And what ways will He teach them, but mercy
wherein He is placable, and truth wherein He is incorrupt? Whereof He
hath exhibited the one in forgiving sins, the other in judging deserts.
And therefore “all the ways of the Lord” are the two advents of the Son
of God, the one in mercy, the other in judgment. He then attaineth unto
Him holding on His ways, who seeing himself freed by no deserts of his
own, lays pride aside, and henceforward bewares of the severity of His
trial, having experienced the clemency of His help. “To them that seek
His testament and His testimonies.” For they understand the Lord as
merciful at His first advent, and as the Judge at His second, who in
meekness and gentleness seek His testament, when with His Own Blood He
redeemed us to a new life; and in the Prophets and Evangelists, His
testimonies.

<span id="ii.XXV-p19"></span>11. “For Thy Name’s sake, O Lord, Thou wilt
be favourable to my sin; for it is manifold” ([Psa.
25.11](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#011)<span id="ii.XXV-p19.1"></span>.md).
Thou hast not only forgiven my sins, which I committed before I
believed; but also to my sin, which is manifold, since even in the way
there is no lack of stumbling, Thou wilt be made favourable by the
sacrifice of a troubled spirit. <span id="fr_638"></span>[639](#fn_638.md)

<span id="ii.XXV-p21"></span>12. “Who is the man that feareth the Lord?”
from which fear he begins to come to wisdom. “He shall establish a law
for him in the way, which he hath chosen” ([Psa.
25.12](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#012)<span id="ii.XXV-p21.1"></span>.md).
He shall establish a law for him in the way, which in his <span
id="page_63">p. 63</span> <span id="ii.XXV-Page_63"></span>freedom he
has taken, that he may not sin now with impunity.

<span id="ii.XXV-p22"></span>13. “His soul shall dwell in good, and his
seed shall, by inheritance, possess the earth” ([Psa.
25.13](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#013)<span id="ii.XXV-p22.1"></span>.md).
And his work shall possess the stable inheritance of a renewed body.

<span id="ii.XXV-p23"></span>14. “The Lord is the stay of them that fear
Him” ([Psa. 25.14](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#014.md)<span
id="ii.XXV-p23.1"></span>). Fear seems to belong to the weak, but the
Lord is the stay of them that fear Him. And the Name of the Lord, which
hath been glorified throughout the whole world, is a stay to them that
fear Him. “And His testament, that it may be manifested unto them.” And
He maketh His testament to be manifested unto them, for the Gentiles and
the bounds of the earth are Christ’s inheritance.

<span id="ii.XXV-p24"></span>15. “Mine eyes are ever unto the Lord; for
He shall pluck my feet out of the snare” ([Psa.
25.15](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#015)<span id="ii.XXV-p24.1"></span>.md).
Nor would I fear the dangers of earth, while I look not upon the earth:
for He upon whom I look, will pluck my feet out of the snare.

<span id="ii.XXV-p25"></span>16. “Look upon me, and have mercy upon me;
for I am single and poor” ([Psa.
25.16](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#016)<span id="ii.XXV-p25.1"></span>.md).
For I am a single people, keeping the lowliness of Thy single Church,
which no schisms or heresies possess.

<span id="ii.XXV-p26"></span>17. “The tribulations of my heart have been
multiplied” ([Psa. 25.17](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#017.md)<span
id="ii.XXV-p26.1"></span>). The tribulations of my heart have been
multiplied by the abounding of iniquity and the waxing cold of
love. <span id="fr_639"></span>[640](#fn_639.md) “O bring Thou me out of my
necessities.” Since I must needs bear this, that by enduring unto the
end I may be saved, bring Thou me out of my necessities.

<span id="ii.XXV-p28"></span>18. “See my humility and my travail” ([Psa.
25.18](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#018)<span id="ii.XXV-p28.1"></span>.md).
See my humility, whereby I never, in the boast of righteousness, break
off from unity; and my travail, wherein I bear with the unruly ones that
are mingled with me. “And forgive all my sins.” And, propitiated by
these sacrifices, forgive all my sins, not those only of youth and my
ignorance before I believed, but those also which, living now by faith,
I commit through infirmity, or the darkness of this life.

<span id="ii.XXV-p29"></span>19. “Consider mine enemies, how they are
multiplied” ([Psa. 25.19](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#019.md)<span
id="ii.XXV-p29.1"></span>). For not only without, but even within, in
the Church’s very communion, they are not wanting. “And with an
unrighteous hate they hate me.” And they hate me who love them.

<span id="ii.XXV-p30"></span>20. “Keep my soul, and deliver me.” Keep my
soul, that I turn not aside to imitate them; and draw me out from the
confusion wherein they are mingled with me. “Let me not be confounded,
for I have put my trust in Thee” ([Psa.
25.20](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#020)<span id="ii.XXV-p30.1"></span>.md).
Let me not be confounded, if haply they rise up against me: for not in
myself, but in Thee have I put my trust.

<span id="ii.XXV-p31"></span>21. “The innocent and the upright have
cleaved to me, for I have waited for Thee, O Lord” ([Psa.
25.21](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#021)<span id="ii.XXV-p31.1"></span>.md).
The innocent and the upright, not in bodily presence only, as the evil,
are mingled with me, but in the agreement of the heart in the same
innocence and uprightness cleave to me: for I have not fallen away to
imitate the evil; but I have waited for Thee, expecting the winnowing of
Thy last harvest.  <span id="fr_640"></span>[641](#fn_640.md)

<span id="ii.XXV-p33"></span>22. “Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his
troubles” ([Psa. 25.22](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#022.md)<span
id="ii.XXV-p33.1"></span>). “Redeem Thy people, O God,” whom Thou hast
prepared to see Thee, out of his troubles, not those only which he bears
without, but those also which he bears within.
