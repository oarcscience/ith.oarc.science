<span id="ii.CVIII"></span>

<span id="ii.CVIII-p1"></span> <span id="ii.CVIII-p1.1"></span><span
class="c20"><span id="ii.CVIII-p1.2"></span>Psalm CVIII. <span
id="fr_4895"></span>[4896](#fn_4895.md) </span>

<span id="ii.CVIII-p3"></span>1. I have not thought that the <span
class="c21"><span id="ii.CVIII-p3.1"></span>CVIII</span>th Psalm
required an exposition; since I have already expounded it in the <span
class="c21"><span id="ii.CVIII-p3.2"></span> LVII</span>th Psalm, <span
id="fr_4896"></span>[4897](#fn_4896.md) and in the <span class="c21"><span
id="ii.CVIII-p4.2"></span> LX</span>th, of the last divisions of which
this Psalm consisteth. For the last part of the <span class="c21"><span
id="ii.CVIII-p4.3"></span> LVII</span>th is the first of this, as far as
the verse, “Thy glory is above all the earth.” Henceforth to the end, is
the last part of the <span class="c21"><span
id="ii.CVIII-p4.4"></span>LX</span>th: as the last part of the <span
class="c21"><span id="ii.CVIII-p4.5"></span>CXXXV</span>th is the same
as that of the <span class="c21"><span id="ii.CVIII-p4.6"></span>
CXV</span>th, <span id="fr_4897"></span>[4898](#fn_4897.md) from the verse,
“The images of the heathen are but gold and silver:” as the <span
class="c21"><span id="ii.CVIII-p5.2"></span> XIV</span>th\[4899\] and
<span class="c21"><span id="ii.CVIII-p5.4"></span> LIII</span>d, <span
id="fr_4898"></span>[4899](#fn_4898.md) with a few alterations in the
middle, have everything the same from the beginning to the end. Whatever
slight differences therefore occur in this <span class="c21"><span
id="ii.CVIII-p6.2"></span>CVIII</span>th Psalm, compared with those two,
of parts of which it is composed, are easy to understand; just as we
find in the <span class="c21"><span
id="ii.CVIII-p6.3"></span>LVII</span>th, <span
id="fr_4899"></span>[4900](#fn_4899.md) “I will sing and give praise;
awake, O my glory:” here,“ I will sing and give praise, with my
glory.” <span id="fr_4900"></span>[4901](#fn_4900.md) Awake, is said there,
that he may sing and give praise therewith. Also, there, “Thy mercy is
great” (or, as some translate, “is lifted up”) “unto the heavens;” <span
id="fr_4901"></span>[4902](#fn_4901.md) but here, “Thy mercy is great above
the heavens.” <span id="fr_4902"></span>[4903](#fn_4902.md) For it is great
unto the heavens, that it may be great in the heavens; and this is what
he wished to express by “above the heavens.” Also in the <span
class="c21"><span id="ii.CVIII-p10.2"></span>LX</span>th, “I will
rejoice, I will divide Shechem:” <span
id="fr_4903"></span>[4904](#fn_4903.md) here “I will be exalted, and will
divide Shechem.” <span id="fr_4904"></span>[4905](#fn_4904.md) Where is
shown what is signified in the division of Shechem, which it was
prophesied should happen after the Lord’s exaltation, and that this joy
doth refer to that exaltation; so that He rejoiceth, because He is
exalted. Whence he elsewhere saith, “Thou hast turned my heaviness into
joy; Thou hast put off my sackcloth and girded me with gladness.” <span
id="fr_4905"></span>[4906](#fn_4905.md) Also there “Ephraim, the strength
of my head:” <span id="fr_4906"></span>[4907](#fn_4906.md) but here,
“Ephraim the taking up of my head.” <span
id="fr_4907"></span>[4908](#fn_4907.md) But strength cometh from taking up,
that is, He maketh men strong by taking up, causing fruit in us; for the
interpretation of Ephraim is, bearing fruit. But “taking up” may be
understood of us, when we take up Christ; or of Christ, when He, who is
Head of the Church, taketh us up. And the words, “them that trouble us,”
in the former Psalm, <span id="fr_4908"></span>[4909](#fn_4908.md) are the
same with “our enemies,” in this. <span
id="fr_4909"></span>[4910](#fn_4909.md)

<span id="ii.CVIII-p18"></span>2. We are taught by this Psalm, that
those titles which seem to refer to history are most rightly understood
prophetically, according to the object of the composition of the
Psalms.…And yet this Psalm is composed of the latter portions of
two, <span id="fr_4910"></span>[4911](#fn_4910.md) whose titles are
different. Where it is signified that each concur in a common object,
not in the surface of the history, but in the depth of prophecy, the
objects of both being united in this one, the title of which is, “A Song
or Psalm of David:” <span id="fr_4911"></span>[4912](#fn_4911.md)
resembling neither of the former titles, otherwise than in the word
David. Since, “in many places, and in diverse manners,” as the Epistle
to the Hebrews saith, “God spoke in former times to the fathers through
the Prophets;” <span id="fr_4912"></span>[4913](#fn_4912.md) yet He spoke
of Him whom He sent afterwards, that the words of the Prophets might be
fulfilled: for “all the promises of God in Him are yea.” <span
id="fr_4913"></span>[4914](#fn_4913.md)
