<span id="ii.VII-p1"></span> <span id="ii.VII-p1.1"></span><span
class="c20"><span id="ii.VII-p1.2"></span>Psalm VII.</span>

<span id="ii.VII-p2"></span>*A psalm to David himself, which he sung to
the Lord, for the words of Chusi, son of Jemini.* <span
id="fr_199"></span>[200](#fn_199.md)

<span id="ii.VII-p4"></span>1. Now the story which gave occasion to this
prophecy may be easily recognised in the second book of Kings. <span
id="fr_200"></span>[201](#fn_200.md) For there Chusi, the friend of king
David, went over to the side of Abessalon, his son, who was carrying on
war against his father, for the purpose of discovering and reporting the
designs which he was taking against his father, at the instigation of
Achitophel, who had revolted from David’s friendship, and was
instructing by his counsel, to the best of his power, the son against
the father. But since it is not the story itself which is to be the
subject of consideration in this Psalm, from which the prophet hath
taken a veil of mysteries, if we have passed over to Christ, let the
veil be taken away. <span id="fr_201"></span>[202](#fn_201.md) And first
let us inquire into the signification of the very names, what it means.
For there have not been wanting interpreters, who investigating these
same words, not carnally according to the letter, but spiritually,
declare to us that Chusi should be interpreted silence; and Gemini,
right-handed; Achitophel, brother’s ruin. Among which interpretations,
Judas, that traitor, again meets us, that Abessalon should bear his
image, according to that interpretation of it as a father’s peace; in
that his father was full of thoughts of peace toward him: although he in
his guile had war in his heart, as was treated of in the third Psalm.
Now as we find in the Gospels that the disciples of our Lord Jesus
Christ are called sons, <span id="fr_202"></span>[203](#fn_202.md) so in
the same Gospels we find they are called brethren also. For the Lord on
the resurrection saith, “Go and say to My brethren.” <span
id="fr_203"></span>[204](#fn_203.md) And the Apostle calls Him “the first
begotten among many brethren.” The ruin then of that disciple, who
betrayed Him, is rightly understood to be a brother’s ruin, which we
said is the interpretation of Achitophel. Now as to Chusi, from the
interpretation of silence, it is rightly understood that our Lord
contended against that guile in silence, that is, in that most deep
secret, whereby “blindness happened in part to Israel,” <span
id="fr_204"></span>[205](#fn_204.md) when they were persecuting the Lord,
that the fulness of the Gentiles might enter in, and “so all Israel
might be saved.” When the Apostle came to this profound secret and deep
silence, he exclaimed, as if struck with a kind of awe of its very
depth, “O the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God!
how unsearchable are His judgments, and His ways past finding out! For
who hath known the wind of the Lord, or who hath been His counsellor?”
 <span id="fr_205"></span>[206](#fn_205.md) Thus that great silence he does
not so much discover by explanation, as he sets forth its greatness in
admiration. In this silence the Lord, hiding the sacrament of His
adorable passion, turns the brother’s voluntary ruin, that is, His
betrayer’s impious wickedness, into the order of His mercy and
providence: that what he with perverse mind wrought for one Man’s
destruction, He might by providential overruling dispose for all men’s
salvation. The perfect soul then, which is already worthy to know the
secret of God, sings a Psalm unto the Lord, she sings “for the words of
Chusi,” because she has attained to know the words of that silence: for
among unbelievers and persecutors there is that silence and secret. But
among His own, to whom it is said, “Now I call you no more servants; for
the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth; but I have called you
friends, for all things that I have heard of My Father I have made known
unto you:  <span id="fr_206"></span>[207](#fn_206.md) among His friends, I
say, there is not the silence, but the words of the silence, that is,
the meaning of that silence set forth and manifested. Which silence,
that is, Chusi, is called the son of Gemini, that is, righthanded. For
what was done for the Saints was not to be hidden from them. And yet He
saith, “Let not the left hand know what the right hand doeth.” <span
id="fr_207"></span>[208](#fn_207.md) The perfect soul then, to which that
secret has been made known, sings in prophecy “for the words of Chusi,”
that is, for the knowledge of that same secret. Which secret God at her
right hand, that is, favourable <span id="fr_208"></span>[209](#fn_208.md)
and propitious unto her, has <span id="page_21">p. 21</span> <span
id="ii.VII-Page_21"></span>wrought. Wherefore this silence is called the
Son of the right hand, which is, “Chusi, the son of Gemini.”

<span id="ii.VII-p14"></span>2. “O Lord my God, in Thee have I hoped:
save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me” ([Psa.
7.1](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#001)<span id="ii.VII-p14.1"></span>.md).
As one to whom, already perfected, all the war and enmity of vice being
overcome, there remaineth no enemy but the envious devil, he says, “Save
me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me ([Psa.
7.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#002)<span id="ii.VII-p14.2"></span>.md):
lest at any time he tear my soul as a lion.” The Apostle says, “Your
adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he
may devour.” <span id="fr_209"></span>[210](#fn_209.md) Therefore when the
Psalmist said in the plural number, “Save me from all them that
persecute me:” he afterwards introduced the singular, saying, “lest at
any time he tear my soul as a lion.” For he does not say, lest at any
time they tear: he knew what enemy and violent adversary of the perfect
soul remained. “Whilst there be none to redeem, nor to save:” that is,
lest he tear me, whilst Thou redeemest not, nor savest. For, if God
redeem not, nor save, he tears.  <span id="fr_210"></span>[211](#fn_210.md)

<span id="ii.VII-p17"></span>3. And that it might be clear that the
already perfect soul, which is to be on her guard against the most
insidious snares of the devil only, says this, see what follows. “O Lord
my God, if I have done this” ([Psa.
7.3](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#003)<span id="ii.VII-p17.1"></span>.md).
What is it that he calls “this”? Since he does not mention the sin by
name, are we to understand sin generally? If this sense displease us, we
may take that to be meant which follows: as if we had asked, what is
this that you say, “this”? He answers, “If there be iniquity in my
hands.” Now then it is clear that it is said of all sin, “If I have
repaid them that recompense me evil” ([Psa.
7.4](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#004)<span id="ii.VII-p17.2"></span>.md).
Which none can say with truth, but the perfect. For so the Lord says,
“Be ye perfect, as your Father which is in heaven; who maketh His sun to
rise upon the good and the evil, and raineth on the just and the
unjust.”  <span id="fr_211"></span>[212](#fn_211.md) He then who repayeth
not them that recompense evil, is perfect. When therefore the perfect
soul prays “for the words of Chusi, the son of Jemini,” that is, for the
knowledge of that secret and silence, which the Lord, favourable to us
and merciful, wrought for our salvation, so as to endure, and with all
patience bear, the guiles of this betrayer: as if He should say to this
perfect soul, explaining the design of this secret, For thee ungodly and
a sinner, that thine iniquities might be washed away by My
blood-shedding, in great silence and great patience I bore with My
betrayer; wilt not thou imitate me, that thou too mayest not repay evil
for evil? Considering then, and understanding what the Lord has done for
him, and by His example going on to perfection, the Psalmist says, “If I
have repaid them that recompense me evil:” that is, if I have not done
what Thou hast taught me by Thy example: “may I therefore fall by mine
enemies empty.” And he says well, not, If I have repaid them that do me
evil; but, who “recompense.” For who so recompenseth, had received
somewhat already. Now it is an instance of greater patience, not even to
repay him evil, who after receiving benefits returns evil for good, than
if without receiving any previous benefit he had had a mind to injure.
If therefore he says, “I have repaid them that recompense me evil:” that
is, If I have not imitated Thee in that silence, that is, in Thy
patience, which Thou hast wrought for me, “may I fall by mine enemies
empty.” For he is an empty boaster, who, being himself a man, desires to
avenge himself on a man; and whilst he openly seeks to overcome a man,
is secretly himself overcome by the devil, rendered empty by vain and
proud joy, because he could not, as it were, be conquered. The Psalmist
knows then where a greater victory may be obtained, and where “the
Father which seeth in secret will reward.”  <span
id="fr_212"></span>[213](#fn_212.md) Lest then he repay them that
recompense evil, he overcomes his anger rather than another man, being
instructed too by those writings, wherein it is written, “Better is he
that overcometh his anger, than he that taketh a city.” <span
id="fr_213"></span>[214](#fn_213.md) “If I have repaid them that recompense
me evil, may I therefore fall by my enemies empty.” He seems to swear by
way of execration, which is the heaviest kind of oath, as when one says,
If I have done so and so, may I suffer so and so. But swearing in a
swearer’s mouth is one thing, in a prophet’s meaning another. For here
he mentions what will really befall men who repay them that recompense
evil; not what, as by an oath, he would imprecate on himself or any
other.

<span id="ii.VII-p21"></span>4. “Let the enemy” therefore “persecute my
soul and take it” ([Psa. 7.5](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#005.md)<span
id="ii.VII-p21.1"></span>). By again naming the enemy in the singular
number, he more and more clearly points out him whom he spoke of above
as a lion. For he persecutes the soul, and if he has deceived it, will
take it. For the limit of men’s rage is the destruction of the body; but
the soul, after this visible death, they cannot keep in their power:
whereas whatever souls the devil shall have taken by his persecutions,
he will keep. “And let him tread my life upon the earth:” that is, by
treading let him make my life earth, that is to say, his food. For he is
not only called a lion, but a serpent too, to whom it was said, “Earth
shalt thou eat.” <span id="fr_214"></span>[215](#fn_214.md) And to the
sinner was <span id="page_22">p. 22</span> <span
id="ii.VII-Page_22"></span>it said, “Earth thou art, and into earth
shalt thou go.” <span id="fr_215"></span>[216](#fn_215.md) “And let him
bring down my glory to the dust.” This is that dust which “the wind
casteth forth from the face of the earth,” <span
id="fr_216"></span>[217](#fn_216.md) to wit, vain and silly boasting of the
proud, puffed up, not of solid weight, as a cloud of dust carried away
by the wind. Justly then has he here spoken of the glory, which he would
not have brought down to dust. For he would have it solidly established
in conscience before God, where there is no boasting. “He that
glorieth,” saith the Apostle, “let him glory in the Lord.” <span
id="fr_217"></span>[218](#fn_217.md) This solidity is brought down to the
dust if one through pride despising the secrecy of conscience, where God
only proves a man, desires to glory before men. Hence comes what the
Psalmist elsewhere says, “God shall bruise the bones of them that please
men.” <span id="fr_218"></span>[219](#fn_218.md) Now he that has well
learnt or experienced the steps in overcoming vices, knows that this
vice of empty glory is either alone, or more than all, to be shunned by
the perfect. For that by which the soul first fell, she overcomes the
last. “For the beginning of all sin is pride:” and again, “The beginning
of man’s pride is to depart from God.” <span
id="fr_219"></span>[220](#fn_219.md)

<span id="ii.VII-p28"></span>5. “Arise, O Lord, in Thine anger” ([Psa.
7.6](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#006)<span id="ii.VII-p28.1"></span>.md).
Why yet does he, who we say is perfect, incite God to anger? Must we not
see, whether he rather be not perfect, who, when he was being stoned,
said, “O Lord, lay not this sin to their charge”? <span
id="fr_220"></span>[221](#fn_220.md) Or does the Psalmist pray thus not
against men, but against the devil and his angels, whose possession
sinners and the ungodly are? He then does not pray against him in wrath,
but in mercy, whosoever prays that that possession may be taken from him
by that Lord “who justifieth the ungodly.” <span
id="fr_221"></span>[222](#fn_221.md) For when the ungodly is justified,
from ungodly he is made just, and from being the possession of the devil
he passes into the temple of God. And since it is a punishment that a
possession, in which one longs to have rule, should be taken away from
him: this punishment, that he should cease to possess those whom he now
possesses, the Psalmist calls the anger of God against the devil.
“Arise, O Lord; in Thine anger.” “Arise” (he has used it as “appear”),
in words, that is, human and obscure; as though God sleeps, when He is
unrecognised and hidden in His secret workings. “Be exalted in the
borders of mine enemies.” He means by borders the possession itself, in
which he wishes that God should be exalted, that is, be honoured and
glorified, rather than the devil, while the ungodly are justified and
praise God. “And arise, O Lord my God, in the commandment that Thou hast
given:” that is, since Thou hast enjoined humility, appear in humility;
and first fulfil what Thou hast enjoined; that men by Thy example
overcoming pride may not be possessed of the devil, who against Thy
commandments advised to pride, saying, “Eat, and your eyes shall be
opened, and ye shall be as gods.” <span
id="fr_222"></span>[223](#fn_222.md)

<span id="ii.VII-p32"></span>6. “And the congregation of the people
shall surround Thee.” This may be understood two ways. For the
congregation of the people can be taken, either of them that believe, or
of them that persecute, both of which took place in the same humiliation
of our Lord: in contempt of which the multitude of them that persecute
surrounded Him; concerning which it is said, “Why have the heathen
raged, and the people meditated vain things?”  <span
id="fr_223"></span>[224](#fn_223.md) But of them that believe through His
humiliation the multitude so surrounded Him, that it could be said with
the greatest truth, “blindness in part is happened unto Israel, that the
fulness of the Gentiles might come in:” <span
id="fr_224"></span>[225](#fn_224.md) and again, “Ask of me, and I will give
Thee the Gentiles for Thine inheritance, and the boundaries of the earth
for Thy possession.” <span id="fr_225"></span>[226](#fn_225.md) “And for
their sakes return Thou on high:” that is, for the sake of this
congregation return Thou on high: which He is understood to have done by
His resurrection and ascension into heaven. For being thus glorified He
gave the Holy Ghost, which before His exaltation could not be given, as
it is written in the Gospel, “for the Holy Ghost was not yet given,
because that Jesus was not yet glorified.” <span
id="fr_226"></span>[227](#fn_226.md) Having then returned on high for the
sake of the congregation of the people, He sent the Holy Ghost: by whom
the preachers of the Gospel being filled, filled the whole world with
Churches.

<span id="ii.VII-p37"></span>7. It can be taken also in this sense:
“Arise, O Lord, in Thine anger, and be exalted in the borders of mine
enemies:” that is, arise in Thine anger, and let not mine enemies
understand Thee; so that to “be exalted,” should be this, become
high, <span id="fr_227"></span>[228](#fn_227.md) that Thou mayest not be
understood; which has reference to the silence spoken of above. For it
is of this exaltation thus said in another Psalm, “And He ascended upon
Cherubim, and flew:” and, “He made darkness His secret place.” <span
id="fr_228"></span>[229](#fn_228.md) In which exaltation, or concealment,
when for their sins’ desert they shall not understand Thee, who shall
crucify Thee, “the congregation” of believers “shall surround Thee.” For
in His very humiliation He was exalted, that is, was not understood. So
that, “And arise, O Lord my God, in the commandment that Thou hast
given:” may have reference to this, that is, when Thou showest Thyself,
be high or deep that mine enemies may not un<span id="page_23">p.
23</span> <span id="ii.VII-Page_23"></span>derstand Thee. Now sinners
are the enemies of the just man, and the ungodly of the godly man. “And
the congregation of the people shall surround Thee:” that is, by this
very circumstance, that those who crucify Thee understand Thee not, the
Gentiles shall believe on Thee, and so “shall the congregation of the
people surround Thee.” But what follows, if this be the true meaning,
has in it more pain, that it begins already to be perceived, than joy
that it is understood. For it follows, “and for their sakes return Thou
on high,” that is, and for the sake of this congregation of the human
race, wherewith the Churches are crowded, return Thou on high, that is,
again cease to be understood. What then is, “and for their sakes,” but
that this congregation too will offend Thee, so that Thou mayest most
truly foretell and say, “Thinkest Thou when the Son of man shall come,
He will find faith on the earth?” <span
id="fr_229"></span>[230](#fn_229.md) Again, of the false prophets, who are
understood to be heretics, He says, “Because of their iniquity the love
of many shall wax cold.” <span id="fr_230"></span>[231](#fn_230.md) Since
then even in the Churches, that is, in that congregation of peoples and
nations, where the Christian name has most widely spread, there shall be
so great abundance of sinners, which is already, in great measure,
perceived; is not that famine of the word <span
id="fr_231"></span>[232](#fn_231.md) here predicted, which has been
threatened by another prophet also? Is it not too for this
congregation’s sake, who, by their sins, are estranging from themselves
that light of truth, that God returns on high, that is, so that faith,
pure and cleansed from the corruption of all perverse opinions, is held
and received, either not at all, or by the very few of whom it was said,
“Blessed is he that shall endure to the end, the same shall be saved”?
 <span id="fr_232"></span>[233](#fn_232.md) Not without cause then is it
said, “and for the sake of this” congregation “return Thou on high:”
that is, again withdraw into the depth of Thy secrecy, even for the sake
of this congregation of the peoples, that hath Thy name, and doeth not
Thy deeds.

<span id="ii.VII-p44"></span>8. But whether the former exposition of
this place, or this last be the more suitable, without prejudice to any
one better, or equal, or as good, it follows very consistently, “the
Lord judgeth the people.” For whether He returned on high, when, after
the resurrection, He ascended into heaven, well does it follow, “The
Lord judgeth the people:” for that He will come from thence to judge the
quick and the dead. Or whether He return on high, when the understanding
of the truth leaves sinful Christians, for that of His coming it has
been said, “Thinkest thou the Son of Man on His coming will find faith
on the earth?” <span id="fr_233"></span>[234](#fn_233.md) “The Lord” then
“judgeth the people.” What Lord, but Jesus Christ? “For the Father
judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son.” <span
id="fr_234"></span>[235](#fn_234.md) Wherefore this soul which prayeth
perfectly, see how she fears not the day of judgment, and with a truly
secure longing says in her prayer, “Thy kingdom come: judge me,” she
says, “O Lord, according to my righteousness.” In the former Psalm a
weak one was entreating, imploring rather the mercy of God, than
mentioning any desert of his own: since the Son of God came “to call
sinners to repentance.” <span id="fr_235"></span>[236](#fn_235.md)
Therefore he had there said, “Save me, O Lord, for Thy mercy’s
sake;” <span id="fr_236"></span>[237](#fn_236.md) that is, not for my
desert’s sake. But now, since being called he hath held and kept the
commandments which he received, he is bold to say, “Judge me, O Lord,
according to my righteousness, and according to my harmlessness, that is
upon me.” This is true harmlessness, which harms not even an enemy.
Accordingly, well does he require to be judged according to his
harmlessness, who could say with truth, “If I have repaid them that
recompense me evil.” As for what he added, “that is upon me,” it can
refer not only to harmlessness, but can be understood also with
reference to righteousness; that the sense should be this, Judge me, O
Lord, according to my righteousness, and according to my harmlessness,
which righteousness and harmlessness is upon me. By which addition he
shows that this very thing, that the soul is righteous and harmless, she
has not by herself, but by God who giveth brightness and light. For of
this he says in another Psalm, “Thou, O Lord, wilt light my
candle.” <span id="fr_237"></span>[238](#fn_237.md) And of John it is said,
that “he was not the light, but bore witness of the light.” <span
id="fr_238"></span>[239](#fn_238.md) “He was a burning and shining
candle.” <span id="fr_239"></span>[240](#fn_239.md) That light then, whence
souls, as candles, are kindled, shines forth not with borrowed, but with
original, brightness, which light is truth itself. It is then so said,
“According to my righteousness, and according to my harmlessness, that
is upon me,” as if a burning and shining candle should say, Judge me
according to the flame which is upon me, that is, not that
wherewith <span id="fr_240"></span>[241](#fn_240.md) I am myself, but that
whereby I shine enkindled of thee.

<span id="ii.VII-p53"></span>9. “But let the wickedness of sinners be
consummated” ([Psa. 7.9](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#009.md)<span
id="ii.VII-p53.1"></span>). He says, “be consummated,” be completed,
according to that in the Apocalypse, “Let the righteous become more
righteous, and let the filthy be filthy still.” <span
id="fr_241"></span>[242](#fn_241.md) For the wickedness of those men
appears consummate, who crucified the Son of God; but greater is theirs
who will not live uprightly, and hate the precepts of truth, for whom
the Son of God was crucified. “Let the wickedness of <span
id="page_24">p. 24</span> <span id="ii.VII-Page_24"></span>sinners,”
then he says, “be consummated,” that is, arrive at the height of
wickedness, that just judgment may be able to come at once. But since it
is not only said, “Let the filthy be filthy still;” but it is said also,
“Let the righteous become more righteous;” he joins on the words, “And
Thou shalt direct the righteous, O God, who searcheth the hearts and
reins.” How then can the righteous be directed but in secret? when even
by means of those things which, in the commencement of the Christian
ages, when as yet the saints were oppressed by the persecution of the
men of this world, appeared marvellous to men, now that the Christian
name has begun to be in such high dignity, hypocrisy, that is pretence,
has increased; of those, I mean, who by the Christian profession had
rather please men than God. How then is the righteous man directed in so
great confusion of pretence, save whilst God searcheth the hearts and
reins; seeing all men’s thoughts, which are meant by the word heart; and
their delights, which are understood by the word reins? For the delight
in things temporal and earthly is rightly ascribed to the reins; for
that it is both the lower part of man, and that region where the
pleasure of carnal generation dwells, through which man’s nature is
transferred into this life of care, and deceiving joy, by the succession
of the race. God then, searching our heart, and perceiving that it is
there where our treasure is, that is, in heaven; searching also the
reins, and perceiving that we do not assent to flesh and blood, but
delight ourselves in the Lord, directs the righteous man in his inward
conscience before Him, where no man seeth, but He alone who perceiveth
what each man thinketh, and what delighteth each. For delight is the end
of care; because to this end does each man strive by care and thought,
that he may attain to his delight. He therefore seeth our cares, who
searcheth the heart. He seeth too the ends of cares, that is delights,
who narrowly searcheth the reins; that when He shall find that our cares
incline neither to the lust of the flesh, nor to the lust of the eyes,
nor to the pride of life, <span id="fr_242"></span>[243](#fn_242.md) all
which pass away as a shadow, but that they are raised upward to the joys
of things eternal, which are spoilt by no change, He may direct the
righteous, even He, the God who searcheth the hearts and reins. For our
works, which we do in deeds and words, may be known unto men; but with
what mind they are done, and to what end we would attain by means of
them, He alone knoweth, the God who searcheth the hearts and reins.

<span id="ii.VII-p56"></span>10. “My righteous help is from the Lord,
who maketh whole the upright in heart” ([Psa.
7.10](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#010)<span id="ii.VII-p56.1"></span>.md).
The offices of medicine are twofold, on the curing infirmity, the other
the preserving health. According to the first it was said in the
preceding Psalm, “Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I am weak;” <span
id="fr_243"></span>[244](#fn_243.md) according to the second it is said in
this Psalm, “If there be iniquity in my hands, if I have repaid them
that recompense me evil, may I therefore <span
id="fr_244"></span>[245](#fn_244.md) fall by my enemies empty.” For there
the weak prays that he may be delivered, here one already whole that he
may not change for the worse. According to the one it is there said,
“Make me whole for Thy mercy’s sake;” according to this other it is here
said, “Judge me, O Lord, according to my righteousness.” For there he
asks for a remedy to escape from disease; but here for protection from
falling into disease. According to the former it is said, “Make me
whole, O Lord, according to Thy mercy:” according to the latter it is
said, “My righteous help is from the Lord, who maketh whole the upright
in heart.” Both the one and the other maketh men whole; but the former
removes them from sickness into health, the latter preserves them in
this health. Therefore there the help is merciful, because the sinner
hath no desert, who as yet longeth to be justified, “believing on Him
who justifieth the ungodly;” <span id="fr_245"></span>[246](#fn_245.md) but
here the help is righteous, because it is given to one already
righteous. Let the sinner then who said, “I am weak,” say in the first
place, “Make me whole, O Lord, for Thy mercy’s sake;” and here let the
righteous man, who said, “If I have repaid them that recompense me
evil,” say, “My righteous help is from the Lord, who maketh whole the
upright in heart.” For if he sets forth the medicine, by which we may be
healed when weak, how much more that by which we may be kept in health.
For if “while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us, how much more
being now justified shall we be kept whole from wrath through
Him.” <span id="fr_246"></span>[247](#fn_246.md)

<span id="ii.VII-p61"></span>11. “My righteous help is from the Lord,
who maketh whole the upright in heart.” God, who searcheth the hearts
and reins, directeth the righteous; but with righteous help maketh He
whole the upright in heart. He doth not as He searcheth the hearts and
reins, so make whole the upright in heart and reins; for the thoughts
are both bad in a depraved heart, and good in an upright heart; but
delights which are not good belong to the reins, for they are more low
and earthly; but those that are good not to the reins, but to the heart
itself. Wherefore men cannot be so called upright in reins, as they are
called upright in heart, since where the thought is, there at once the
delight is too; which cannot be, unless when things divine and eternal
are thought of. “Thou hast given,” he says, “joy in my heart,” when he
had said, “The light of Thy countenance <span id="page_25">p. 25</span>
<span id="ii.VII-Page_25"></span>has been stamped on us, O Lord.” <span
id="fr_247"></span>[248](#fn_247.md) For although the phantoms of things
temporal, which the mind falsely pictures to itself, when tossed by vain
and mortal hope, to vain imagination oftentimes bring a delirious and
maddened joy; yet this delight must be attributed not to the heart, but
to the reins; for all these imaginations have been drawn from lower,
that is, earthly and carnal things. Hence it comes, that God, who
searcheth the hearts and reins, and perceiveth in the heart upright
thoughts, in the reins no delights, affordeth righteous help to the
upright in heart, where heavenly <span id="fr_248"></span>[249](#fn_248.md)
delights are coupled with clean thoughts. And therefore when in another
Psalm he had said, “Moreover even to-night my reins have chided me;” he
went on to say as touching help, “I foresaw the Lord alway in my sight,
for He is on my right hand, that I should not be moved.” <span
id="fr_249"></span>[250](#fn_249.md) Where he shows that he suffered
suggestions only from the reins, not delights as well; for he had
suffered these, then he would of course be moved. But he said, “The Lord
is on my right hand, that I should not be moved;” and then he adds,
“Wherefore was my heart delighted;” that the reins should have been able
to chide, not delight him. The delight accordingly was produced not in
the reins, but there, where against the chiding of the reins God was
foreseen to be on the right hand, that is, in the heart.

<span id="ii.VII-p65"></span>12. “God the righteous judge, strong <span
id="fr_250"></span>[251](#fn_250) (in endurance.md) and long-suffering”
([Psa. 7.11](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#011.md)<span
id="ii.VII-p66.1"></span>). What God is judge, but the Lord, who judgeth
the people? He is righteous; who “shall render to every man according to
his works.” <span id="fr_251"></span>[252](#fn_251.md) He is strong (in
endurance); who, being most powerful, for our salvation bore even with
ungodly persecutors. He is long-suffering; who did not immediately,
after His resurrection, hurry away to punishment, even those that
persecuted Him, but bore with them, that they might at length turn from
that ungodliness to salvation: and still He beareth with them, reserving
the last penalty for the last judgment, and up to this present time
inviting sinners to repentance. “Not bringing in anger every day.”
Perhaps “bringing in anger” is a more significant expression than being
angry (and so we find it in the Greek <span
id="fr_252"></span>[253](#fn_252) copies.md); that the anger, whereby He
punisheth, should not be in Him, but in the minds of those ministers who
obey the commandments of truth through whom orders are given even to the
lower ministries, who are called angels of wrath, to punish sin: whom
even now the punishment of men delights not for justice’ sake, in which
they have no pleasure, but for malice’ sake. God then doth not “bring in
anger every day,” that is, He doth not collect His ministers for
vengeance every day. For now the patience of God inviteth to repentance:
but in the last time, when men “through their hardness and impenitent
heart shall have treasured up for themselves anger in the day of anger,
and revelation of the righteous judgment of God, <span
id="fr_253"></span>[254](#fn_253.md) then He will brandish His sword.”

<span id="ii.VII-p70"></span>13. “Unless ye be converted,” He says, “He
will brandish His sword” ([Psa.
7.12](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#012)<span id="ii.VII-p70.1"></span>.md).
The Lord Man Himself may be taken to be God’s double-edged sword, that
is, His spear, which at His first coming He will not brandish, but
hideth as it were in the sheath of humiliation: but He will brandish it,
when at the second coming to judge the quick and dead, in the manifest
splendour of His glory, He shall flash light on His righteous ones, and
terror on the ungodly. For in other copies, instead of, “He shall
brandish His sword,” it has been written, “He shall make bright His
spear:” by which word I think the last coming of the Lord’s glory most
appropriately signified: seeing that is understood of His person, which
another Psalm has, “Deliver, O Lord, my soul from the ungodly, <span
id="fr_254"></span>[255](#fn_254.md) Thy spear from the enemies of Thine
hand. He hath bent His bow, and made it ready.” The tenses of the words
must not be altogether overlooked, how he has spoken of “the sword” in
the future, “He will brandish;” of “the bow” in the past, “He hath
bent:” and these words of the past tense follow after. <span
id="fr_255"></span>[256](#fn_255.md)

<span id="ii.VII-p73"></span>14. “And in it He hath prepared the
instruments of death: He hath wrought His arrows for the burning” ([Psa.
7.13](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#013)<span id="ii.VII-p73.1"></span>.md).
That bow then I would readily take to be the Holy Scripture, in which by
the strength of the New Testament, as by a sort of string, the hardness
of the Old has been bent and subdued. From thence the Apostles are sent
forth like arrows, or divine preachings are shot. Which arrows “He has
wrought for the burning,” arrows, that is, whereby being stricken they
might be inflamed with heavenly love. For by what other arrows was she
stricken, who saith, “Bring me into the house of wine, place me among
perfumes, crowd me among honey, for I have been wounded with
love”? <span id="fr_256"></span>[257](#fn_256.md) By what other arrows is
he kindled, who, desirous of returning to God, and coming back from
wandering, asketh for help against crafty tongues, and to whom it is
said, “What shall be given thee, or what added to thee against the
crafty tongue? Sharp arrows of the mighty, with devastating
coals:” <span id="fr_257"></span>[258](#fn_257.md) that is, coals, whereby,
when thou art stricken and set on fire, thou mayest burn with so great
love of the kingdom of heaven, as to despise the tongues of all that
<span id="page_26">p. 26</span> <span id="ii.VII-Page_26"></span>resist
thee, and would recall thee from thy purpose, and to deride their
persecutions, saying, “Who shall separate me from the love of Christ?
shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness,
or peril, or sword? For I am persuaded,” he says, “that neither death,
nor life, nor angel, nor principality, nor things present, not things to
come, nor power, nor height, nor depth, nor other creature, shall be
able to separate me from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our
Lord.” <span id="fr_258"></span>[259](#fn_258.md) Thus for the burning hath
He wrought His arrows. For in the Greek copies it is found thus, “He
hath wrought His arrows for the burning.” But most of the Latin
copies <span id="fr_259"></span>[260](#fn_259.md) have “burning arrows.”
But whether the arrows themselves burn, or make others burn, which of
course they cannot do unless they burn themselves, the sense is
complete.

<span id="ii.VII-p78"></span>15. But since he has said that the Lord has
prepared not arrows only, but “instruments of death” too, in the bow, it
may be asked, what are “instruments of death”? Are they, per-adventure,
heretics? For they too, out of the same bow, that is, out of the same
Scriptures, light upon souls not to be inflamed with love but destroyed
with poison: which does not happen but after their deserts: wherefore
even this dispensation is to be assigned to the Divine Providence, not
that it makes men sinners, but that it orders them after they have
sinned. For through sin reaching them with an ill purpose, they are
forced to understand them ill, that this should be itself the punishment
of sin: by whose death, nevertheless, the sons of the Catholic Church
are, as it were by certain thorns, so to say, aroused from slumber, and
make progress toward the understanding of the holy Scriptures. “For
there must be also heresies, that they which are approved,” he says,
“may be made manifest among you:” <span
id="fr_260"></span>[261](#fn_260.md) that is, among men, seeing they are
manifest to God. Or has He haply ordained the same arrows to be at once
instruments of death for the destruction of unbelievers, and wrought
them burning, or for the burning, for the exercising of the faithful?
For that is not false that the Apostle says, “To the one we are the
savour of life unto life, to the other the savour of death unto death;
and who is sufficient for these things?” <span
id="fr_261"></span>[262](#fn_261.md) It is no wonder then if the same
Apostles be both instruments of death in those from whom they suffered
persecution, and fiery arrows to inflame the hearts of believers.

<span id="ii.VII-p81"></span>16. Now after this dispensation righteous
judgment will come: of which the Psalmist so speaks, as that we may
understand that each man’s punishment is wrought out of his own sin, and
his iniquity turned into vengeance: that we may not suppose that that
tranquillity and ineffable light of God brings forth from Itself the
means of punishing sin; but that it so ordereth sins, that what have
been delights to man in sinning, should be instruments to the Lord
avenging. “Behold,” he says, “he hath travailed with injustice.” Now
what had he conceived, that he should travail with injustice? “He hath
conceived,” he says, “toil.” Hence then comes that, “In toil shall thou
eat thy bread.” <span id="fr_262"></span>[263](#fn_262.md) Hence too that,
“Come unto Me all ye that toil and are heavy laden; for My yoke is easy,
and My burden light.” <span id="fr_263"></span>[264](#fn_263.md) For toil
will never cease, except one love that which cannot be taken away
against his will. For when those things are loved which we can lose
against our will, we must needs toil for them most miserably; and to
obtain them, amid the straitnesses of earthly cares, whilst each desires
to snatch them for himself, and to be beforehand with another, or to
wrest it from him, must scheme injustice. Duly then, and quite in order,
hath he travailed with injustice, who has conceived toil. Now he
bringeth forth what, save that with which he hath travailed, although he
has not travailed with that which he conceived? For that is not born,
which is not conceived; but seed is conceived, that which is formed from
the seed is born. Toil is then the seed of iniquity, but sin the
conception of toil, that is, that first sin, to “depart from God.” <span
id="fr_264"></span>[265](#fn_264.md) He then hath travailed with injustice,
who hath conceived toil. “And he hath brought forth iniquity.”
“Iniquity” is the same as “injustice:” he hath brought forth then that
with which he travailed. What follows next?

<span id="ii.VII-p85"></span>17. “He hath opened a ditch, and digged it”
([Psa. 7.15](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#015.md)<span
id="ii.VII-p85.1"></span>). To open a ditch is, in earthly matters, that
is, as it were in the earth, to prepare deceit, that another fall
therein, whom the unrighteous man wishes to deceive. Now this ditch is
opened when consent is given to the evil suggestion of earthly lusts:
but it is digged when after consent we press on to actual work of
deceit. But how can it be, that iniquity should rather hurt the
righteous man against whom it proceeds, than the unrighteous heart
whence it proceeds? Accordingly, the stealer of money, for instance,
while he desires to inflict painful harm upon another, is himself maimed
by the wound of avarice. Now who, even out of his right mind, sees not
how great is the difference between these men, when one suffers the loss
of money, the other of innocence? “He will fall” then “into the pit
which <span id="page_27">p. 27</span> <span
id="ii.VII-Page_27"></span>he hath made.” As it is said in another
Psalm, “The Lord is known in executing judgments; the sinner is caught
in the works of his own hands.” <span id="fr_265"></span>[266](#fn_265.md)

<span id="ii.VII-p87"></span>18. “His toil shall be turned on his head,
and his iniquity shall descend on his pate” ([Psa.
7.16](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#016)<span id="ii.VII-p87.1"></span>.md).
For he had no mind to escape sin: but was brought under sin as a slave,
so to say, as the Lord saith, “Whosoever sinneth is a slave.” <span
id="fr_266"></span>[267](#fn_266.md) His iniquity then will be upon him,
when he is subject to his iniquity; for he could not say to the Lord,
what the innocent and upright say, “My glory, and the lifter up of my
head.” <span id="fr_267"></span>[268](#fn_267.md) He then will be in such
wise below, as that his iniquity may be above, and descend on him; for
that it weigheth him down and burdens him, and suffers him not to fly
back to the rest of the saints. This occurs, when in an ill regulated
man reason is a slave, and lust hath dominion.

<span id="ii.VII-p90"></span>19. “I will confess to the Lord according
to His justice” ([Psa. 7.17](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#017.md)<span
id="ii.VII-p90.1"></span>). This is not the sinner’s confession: for he
says this, who said above most truly, “If there be iniquity in my
hands:” but it is a confession of God’s justice, in which we speak thus,
Verily, O Lord, Thou art just, in that Thou both so protectest the just,
that Thou enlightenest them by Thyself; and so orderest sinners, that
they be punished not by Thine, but by their own malice. This confession
so praises the Lord, that the blasphemies of the ungodly can avail
nothing, who, willing to excuse their evil deeds, are unwilling to
attribute to their own fault that they sin, that is, are unwilling to
attribute their fault to their fault. Accordingly they find either
fortune or fate to accuse, or the devil, to whom He who made us hath
willed that it should be in our power to refuse consent: or they bring
in another nature, which is not of God: wretched waverers, and erring,
rather than confessing to God, that He should pardon them. For it is not
fit that any be pardoned, except he says, I have sinned. He, then, that
sees the deserts of souls so ordered by God, that while each has his own
given him, the fair beauty of the universe is in no part violated, in
all things praises God: and this is not the confession of sinners, but
of the righteous. For it is not the sinner’s confession when the Lord
says, “I confess to Thee, O Lord of heaven and earth, because Thou hast
hid these things from the wise, and revealed them to babes.”  <span
id="fr_268"></span>[269](#fn_268.md) Likewise in Ecclesiasticus it is said,
“Confess to the Lord in all His works: and in confession ye shall say
this, All the works of the Lord are exceeding good.” <span
id="fr_269"></span>[270](#fn_269.md) Which can be seen in this Psalm, if
any one with a pious mind, by the Lord’s help, distinguish between the
rewards of the righteous and the penalties of the sinners, how that in
these two the whole creation, which God made and rules, is adorned with
a beauty wondrous and known to few. Thus then he says, “I will confess
to the Lord according to His justice,” as one who saw that darkness was
not made by God, but ordered nevertheless. For God said, “Let light be
made, and light was made.” <span id="fr_270"></span>[271](#fn_270.md) He
did not say, Let darkness be made, and darkness was made: and yet He
ordered it. And therefore it is said, “God divided between the light,
and the darkness: and God called the light day, and the darkness He
called night.” <span id="fr_271"></span>[272](#fn_271.md) This is the
distinction, He made the one and ordered it: but the other He made not,
but yet He ordered this too. But now that sins are signified by
darkness, so is it seen in the Prophet, who says, “And thy darkness
shall be as the noon day:” <span id="fr_272"></span>[273](#fn_272.md) and
in the Apostle, who says, “He that hateth his brother is in
darkness:” <span id="fr_273"></span>[274](#fn_273.md) and above all that
text, “Let us cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the
armour of light.” <span id="fr_274"></span>[275](#fn_274.md) Not that there
is any nature of darkness. For all nature, in so far as it is nature, is
compelled to be. Now being belongs to light: not being to darkness. He
then that leaves Him by whom he was made, and inclines to that whence he
was made, that is, to nothing, is in this sin endarkened: and yet he
does not utterly perish, but he is ordered among the lowest things.
Therefore after the Psalmist said, “I will confess unto the Lord:” that
we might not understand it of confession of sins, he adds lastly, “And I
will sing to the name of the Lord most high.” Now singing has relation
to joy, but repentance of sins to sadness.

<span id="ii.VII-p98"></span>20. This Psalm can also be taken in the
person of the Lord Man: if only that which is there spoken in
humiliation be referred to our weakness, which He bore. <span
