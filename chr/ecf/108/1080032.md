<span id="ii.XXVIII"></span>

<span id="ii.XXVIII-p1"></span> <span id="ii.XXVIII-p1.1"></span><span
class="c20"><span id="ii.XXVIII-p1.2"></span>Psalm XXVIII. <span
id="fr_654"></span>[655](#fn_654) </span>

<span id="ii.XXVIII-p3"></span>Of David himself.

<span id="ii.XXVIII-p4"></span>1. It is the Voice of the Mediator
Himself, strong of hand in the conflict of the Passion. Now what He
seems to wish for against His enemies, is not the wish of malevolence,
but the declaration of their punishment; as in the Gospel, <span
id="fr_655"></span>[656](#fn_655) with the cities, in which though He
had performed miracles, yet they had not believed on Him, He doth not
wish in any evil will what He saith, but predicteth what is impending
over them.

<span id="ii.XXVIII-p6"></span>2. “Unto Thee, O Lord, have I
cried; <span id="fr_656"></span>[657](#fn_656) My God, be not silent
from me” ([Psa. 28.1](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#001)<span
id="ii.XXVIII-p7.1"></span>). Unto Thee, O Lord, have I cried; My God,
separate not the unity of Thy Word from that which as Man I am. “Lest at
any time Thou be silent from me: and I shall be like them that go down
into the pit.” For from this, that the Eternity of Thy Word ceaseth not
to unite Itself to Me, it comes that I am not such a man as the rest of
men, who are born into the deep misery of this <span id="page_66">p.
66</span> <span id="ii.XXVIII-Page_66"></span>world: where, as if Thou
art silent, Thy Word is not recognised. “Hear, O Lord, the voice of my
supplication, whist I pray unto Thee, whilst I hold up my hands to Thy
holy temple” ([Psa. 28.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#002)<span
id="ii.XXVIII-p7.2"></span>). Whilst I am crucified for their salvation,
who on believing become Thy holy temple.

<span id="ii.XXVIII-p8"></span>3. “Draw not My Soul away with sinners,
and destroy me not with them that work iniquity, with them that speak
peace with their neighbours” ([Psa.
28.3](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#003)<span
id="ii.XXVIII-p8.1"></span>). With them that say unto Me, “We know that
Thou art a Master come from God.” <span
id="fr_657"></span>[658](#fn_657) “But evil in their hearts.” But they
speak evil in their hearts.

<span id="ii.XXVIII-p10"></span>4. “Give unto them according to their
works” ([Psa. 28.4](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#004)<span
id="ii.XXVIII-p10.1"></span>). Give unto them according to their works,
for this is just. “And according to the malice of their
affections.” <span id="fr_658"></span>[659](#fn_658) For aiming at evil,
they cannot discover good. “According to the works of their hands give
Thou unto them.” Although what they have done may avail for salvation to
others, yet give Thou unto them according to the works of their wills.
“Pay them their recompense.” Because, for the truth which they heard,
they wished to recompense deceit; let their own deceit deceive them.

<span id="ii.XXVIII-p12"></span>5. “For they have not had understanding
in the works of the Lord” ([Psa.
28.5](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#005)<span
id="ii.XXVIII-p12.1"></span>). And whence is it clear that this hath
befallen them? From this forsooth, “for they have not had understanding
in the works of the Lord.” This very thing, in truth, hath been, even
now, their recompense, that in Him whom they tempted with malicious
intent as a Man, they should not recognise God, with what design the
Father sent Him in the Flesh. “And the works of His hands.” Nor be moved
by those visible works, which are laid out before their very eyes. “Thou
shalt destroy them, and not build them up.” Let them do Me no hurt, nay,
nor again in their endeavour to raise engines against My Church, let
them aught avail.

<span id="ii.XXVIII-p13"></span>6. “Blessed be the Lord, for He hath
heard the voice of My prayer” ([Psa.
28.6](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#006)<span
id="ii.XXVIII-p13.1"></span>).

<span id="ii.XXVIII-p14"></span>7. “The Lord My Helper and My Protector”
([Psa. 28.7](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#007)<span
id="ii.XXVIII-p14.1"></span>). The Lord helping Me in so great
sufferings, and protecting Me with immortality in My resurrection. “In
Him hath My Heart trusted, and I have been helped.” “And My Flesh hath
flourished again:” that is, and My Flesh hath risen again. “And of my
will I will confess unto Him.” Wherefore, the fear of death being now
destroyed, not by the necessity of fear under the Law, but with a free
will with the Law, shall they who believe on Me, confess unto Him; and
because I am in them, I will confess.

<span id="ii.XXVIII-p15"></span>8. “The Lord is the strength of His
people” ([Psa. 28.8](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#008)<span
id="ii.XXVIII-p15.1"></span>). Not that people “ignorant of the
righteousness of God, and willing to establish their own.” <span
id="fr_659"></span>[660](#fn_659) For they thought not themselves strong
in themselves: for the Lord is the strength of His people, struggling in
this life’s difficulties with the devil. “And the protector of the
salvation of His Christ.” That, having saved them by His Christ after
the strength of war, He may protect them at the last with the
immortality of peace.

<span id="ii.XXVIII-p17"></span>9. “Save Thy people, and bless Thine
inheritance” ([Psa. 28.9](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#009)<span
id="ii.XXVIII-p17.1"></span>). I intercede therefore, after My Flesh
hath flourished again, because Thou hast said, “Desire of Me, and I will
give Thee the heathen for Thine inheritance;” <span
id="fr_660"></span>[661](#fn_660) “Save Thy people, and bless Thine
inheritance:” for “all Mine are Thine.” <span
id="fr_661"></span>[662](#fn_661) “And rule them, and set them up even
for ever.” And rule them in this temporal life, and raise them from
hence into life eternal.
