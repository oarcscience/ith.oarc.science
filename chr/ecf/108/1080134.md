<span id="ii.CXIX.iv-p1"></span> <span id="page_564">p. 564</span> <span
id="ii.CXIX.iv-Page_564"></span>*<span class="c2"><span
id="ii.CXIX.iv-p1.1"></span>Daleth.</span>*

<span id="ii.CXIX.iv-p2"></span>25. “My soul cleaveth to the pavement: O
quicken Thou me according to Thy word” ([Psa.
119.25](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#025)<span
id="ii.CXIX.iv-p2.1"></span>). What meaneth, “My soul cleaveth to the
pavement, O quicken Thou me according to Thy word”?…If we look upon the
whole world as one great house, we see that the heavens represent its
vaulting, the earth therefore will be its pavement. He wisheth therefore
to be rescued from earthly things, and to say with the Apostle, “Our
conversation <span id="fr_5154"></span>[5155](#fn_5154) is in heaven.”
To cling therefore to earthly things is the soul’s death; the contrary
of which evil, life is prayed for, when he saith, “O quicken Thou me.”

<span id="ii.CXIX.iv-p4"></span>26. …The body itself also, because it is
of the earth, is reasonably understood by the word pavement; since,
because it is still corruptible and weigheth down the soul, <span
id="fr_5155"></span>[5156](#fn_5155) we justly groan while in it, and
say unto God, “O quicken Thou me.” For we shall not be without our
bodies when we shall be for evermore with the Lord; <span
id="fr_5156"></span>[5157](#fn_5156) but then because they will not be
corruptible, nor will they weigh down our souls, if we view it strictly,
we shall not cleave unto them, but they rather unto us, and we unto
God.…

<span id="ii.CXIX.iv-p7"></span>27. For what he was by himself, he
confesseth in the following words: “I have acknowledged my ways, and
Thou heardest me” ([Psa. 119.26](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#026)<span
id="ii.CXIX.iv-p7.1"></span>). Some copies indeed read, “Thy ways:” but
more, and the best Greek, read “my ways,” that is, evil ways. For he
seemeth to me to say this; I have confessed my sins, and Thou hast heard
me; that is, so that Thou wouldest remit them. “O teach me Thy
statutes.” I have acknowledged my ways: Thou hast blotted them out:
teach me Thine. So teach me, that I may act; not merely that I may know
how I ought to act. For as it is said of the Lord, that He knew not
sin, <span id="fr_5157"></span>[5158](#fn_5157) and it is understood,
that He did no sin; so also he ought truly to be said to know
righteousness, who doeth it. This is the prayer of one who is
improving.…

<span id="ii.CXIX.iv-p9"></span>28. Finally he addeth, “Intimate to me
the way of Thy righteousness” ([Psa.
119.27](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#027)<span
id="ii.CXIX.iv-p9.1"></span>); or, as some copies have it, “instruct
me;” which is expressed more closely from the Greek, “Make me to
understand the way of Thy righteousnesses; so shall I be exercised in
Thy wondrous things.” These higher commandments, which he desireth to
understand by edification, he calleth the wondrous things of God. There
are then some righteousnesses of God so wondrous, that human weakness
may be believed incapable of fulfilling them by those who have not
tried. Whence the Psalmist, struggling and wearied with the difficulty
of obeying them, saith, “My soul hath slumbered for very heaviness: O
stablish Thou me with Thy word!” ([Psa.
119.28](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#028)<span
id="ii.CXIX.iv-p9.2"></span>). What meaneth, hath slumbered? save that
he hath cooled in the hope which he had entertained of being able to
reach them. But, he addeth, “Stablish Thou me with Thy word:” that I may
not by slumbering fall away from those duties which I feel that I have
already attained: stablish Thou me therefore in those words of Thine
that I already hold, that I may be able to reach unto others through
edification.

<span id="ii.CXIX.iv-p10"></span>29. “Take Thou from me the way of
iniquity” ([Psa. 119.29](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#029)<span
id="ii.CXIX.iv-p10.1"></span>). And since the law of works hath entered
in, that sin might abound; <span id="fr_5158"></span>[5159](#fn_5158) he
addeth, “And pity me according to Thy law.” By what law, save by the law
of faith? Hear the Apostle: “Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By
what law? Of works. Nay: but by the law of faith.” <span
id="fr_5159"></span>[5160](#fn_5159) This is the law of faith, whereby
we believe and pray that it may be granted us through grace; that we may
effect that which we cannot fulfil through ourselves; that we may not,
ignorant of God’s righteousness, and going about to stablish our own,
fail to submit ourselves unto the righteousness of God. <span
id="fr_5160"></span>[5161](#fn_5160)

<span id="ii.CXIX.iv-p14"></span>30. But after he had said, “And pity me
according to Thy law;” he mentioneth some of those blessings which he
hath already obtained, that he may ask others that he hath not yet
gained. For he saith, “I have chosen the way of truth: and Thy judgments
I have not forgotten” ([Psa.
119.30](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#030)<span
id="ii.CXIX.iv-p14.1"></span>). “I have stuck unto Thy testimonies: O
Lord, confound me not” ([Psa.
119.31](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#031)<span
id="ii.CXIX.iv-p14.2"></span>): may I persevere in striving toward the
point whereunto I am running: may I arrive whither I am running! So then
“it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that
showeth mercy.” <span id="fr_5161"></span>[5162](#fn_5161) He next
saith, “I will run the way of Thy commandments, when Thou hast widened
my heart” ([Psa. 119.32](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#032)<span
id="ii.CXIX.iv-p15.2"></span>). I could not run hadst Thou not widened
my heart. The sense of the words, “I have chosen the way of truth, and
Thy judgments I have not forgotten: I have stuck unto Thy testimonies,”
is clearly explained in this verse. For this running is along the way of
the commandments of God. And because he doth allege unto the Lord rather
His blessings than his own deservings; as if it were said unto him, How
hast thou run that way, by choosing, and by not forgetting the judgments
of God, and by sticking to His testimonies? Couldest thou do these
things by thyself? I could not, he replieth. It is not therefore through
my own will, as though it needed no aid of Thine; but because “Thou has
widened my heart.” The widening of the heart is the delight we take in
righteousness. This is the gift of God, the effect of which is, that we
are not straitened in His commandments through <span id="page_565">p.
565</span> <span id="ii.CXIX.iv-Page_565"></span>the fear of punishment,
but widened through love, and the delight we have in righteousness.…
