<span id="ii.XXIV-p1"></span> <span id="ii.XXIV-p1.1"></span><span
class="c20"><span id="ii.XXIV-p1.2"></span>Psalm XXIV. <span
id="fr_619"></span>[620](#fn_619.md) </span>

<span id="ii.XXIV-p3"></span>*A psalm of David himself, on the first day
of the week.* <span id="fr_620"></span>[621](#fn_620.md)

<span id="ii.XXIV-p5"></span>1. A Psalm of David himself, touching the
glorifying and resurrection of the Lord, which took place early in the
morning on the first day of the week, which is now called the Lord’s
Day.

<span id="ii.XXIV-p6"></span>2. “The earth is the Lord’s, and the
fulness thereof, the compass of the world, and all they that dwell
therein” ([Psa. 24.1](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#001.md)<span
id="ii.XXIV-p6.1"></span>); when the Lord, being glorified, is announced
for the believing of all nations; and the whole compass of the world
becomes His Church. “He hath founded it above the seas.” He hath most
firmly established it above all the waves of this world, that they
should be subdued by it, and should not hurt it. “And hath prepared it
above the rivers” ([Psa. 24.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#002.md)<span
id="ii.XXIV-p6.2"></span>). The rivers flow into the sea, and men of
lust lapse into the world: these also the Church, which, when worldly
lusts have been conquered by the grace of God, hath been prepared by
love for the reception of immortality, subdues.

<span id="ii.XXIV-p7"></span>3. “Who shall ascend into the mount of the
Lord?” Who shall ascend to the height of the righteousness of the Lord?
“Or who shall stand in His holy place?” ([Psa.
24.3](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#003)<span id="ii.XXIV-p7.1"></span>.md).
Or who shall abide in that place, whither He shall ascend, <span
id="fr_621"></span>[622](#fn_621.md) founded above the seas, and prepared
above the rivers?

<span id="ii.XXIV-p9"></span>4. “The innocent of hand, and the pure in
heart” ([Psa. 24.4](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#004.md)<span
id="ii.XXIV-p9.1"></span>). Who then shall ascend thither, and abide
there, but the guiltless in deed, and pure in thought? “Who hath not
received his soul in vain.” Who hath not reckoned his soul among things
that pass away, but feeling it to be immortal, hath longed for an
eternity stedfast and unchangeable. “And hath not sworn in deceit to his
neighbour.” And therefore without deceit, as things eternal are simple
and undeceiving, hath so behaved himself to his neighbour.

<span id="ii.XXIV-p10"></span>5. “This man shall receive blessing from
the Lord, and mercy from the God of his salvation” <span
id="fr_622"></span>[623](#fn_622.md) ([Psa.
24.5](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#005)<span id="ii.XXIV-p11.1"></span>.md).

<span id="ii.XXIV-p12"></span>6. “This is the generation of them that
seek the Lord” ([Psa. 24.6](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#006.md)<span
id="ii.XXIV-p12.1"></span>). For thus are they born that seek Him. “Of
them that seek the face of the God of Jacob. <span
id="fr_623"></span>[624](#fn_623.md) *Diapsalma.*” Now they seek the face
of God, who gave the pre-eminence to the younger born. <span
id="fr_624"></span>[625](#fn_624.md)

<span id="ii.XXIV-p15"></span>7. “Take away your gates, ye princes”
([Psa. 24.7](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#007.md)<span
id="ii.XXIV-p15.1"></span>). All ye, that seek rule among men, remove,
that they hinder not, the entrances which ye have made, of desire and
fear. “And be ye lift up, ye everlasting gates.” And be ye lift up, ye
entrances of eternal life, of renunciation of the world, and conversion
to God. “And the King of glory shall come in.” And the King, in whom we
may glory without pride, shall come in: who having overcome the gates of
death, and having opened for Himself the heavenly places, fulfilled that
which He said, “Be of good cheer, for I have overcome the world.” <span
id="fr_625"></span>[626](#fn_625.md)

<span id="ii.XXIV-p17"></span>8. “Who is this King of glory?” Mortal
nature is awe-struck in wonder, and asks, “Who is this King of glory?”
“The Lord strong and mighty.” He whom thou didst deem weak and
overwhelmed. “The Lord mighty in battle” ([Psa.
24.8](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#008)<span id="ii.XXIV-p17.1"></span>.md).
Handle the scars, and thou wilt find them made whole, and human weakness
restored to immortality. The glorifying of the Lord, which was owing to
earth, where It warred with death, hath been paid.

<span id="ii.XXIV-p18"></span>9. “Take away your gates, ye
princes.” <span id="fr_626"></span>[627](#fn_626.md) Let us go hence
straightway into heaven. Again, let the Prophet’s trumpet cry aloud,
“Take away too, ye princes of the air, the gates, which ye have in the
minds of men who ‘worship the host of heaven.’” <span
id="fr_627"></span>[628](#fn_627.md) “And be ye lift up, ye everlasting
gates.” And be ye lift up, ye doors of everlasting righteousness, of
love, and chastity, through which the soul loveth the One True God, and
goeth not a-whoring with the many that are called gods. “And the King of
glory shall come in” ([Psa. 24.9](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#009.md)<span
id="ii.XXIV-p20.2"></span>). “And the King of glory shall come in,” that
He may at the right hand of the Father intercede for us.

<span id="ii.XXIV-p21"></span>10. “Who is this King of glory?” What!
dost thou too, prince of the power of this air, <span
id="fr_628"></span>[629](#fn_628.md) marvel and ask, “Who is this King of
glory?” “The Lord of powers, He is the King of glory” ([Psa.
24.10](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#010.md)<span
id="ii.XXIV-p22.2"></span>). Yea, His Body now quickened, He who was
tempted marches above thee; He who was tempted by the angel, the
deceiver, goes above all angels. Let none of you put himself before us
and stop our way, that he may be worshipped as a god by us: neither
principality, nor angel, nor power, separateth us from the love of
Christ. <span id="fr_629"></span>[630](#fn_629.md) It is good to trust in
the Lord, rather than to trust in a prince; <span
id="fr_630"></span>[631](#fn_630.md) that he who glorieth, should glory in
the Lord. <span id="fr_631"></span>[632](#fn_631.md) These indeed are
powers in the administration of this world, but “the Lord of powers, He
is the King of glory.”
