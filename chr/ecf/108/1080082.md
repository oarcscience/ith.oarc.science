<span id="ii.LXXI-p1"></span> <span id="ii.LXXI-p1.1"></span><span
class="c20"><span id="ii.LXXI-p1.2"></span>Psalm LXXI. <span
id="fr_3071"></span>[3072](#fn_3071.md) </span>

<span id="ii.LXXI-p3"></span>1. In all the holy Scriptures the grace of
God that delivereth us commendeth itself to us, in order that it may
have us commended. This is sung of in this Psalm, whereof we have
undertaken to speak.…This grace the Apostle commendeth: by this he got
to have the Jews for enemies, boasting of the letter of the law and of
their own justice. This then commending in the lesson which hath been
read, he saith thus: “For I am the least of the Apostles, that am not
worthy to be called an Apostle, because I persecuted the Church of
God.” <span id="fr_3072"></span>[3073](#fn_3072.md) “But therefore mercy,”
he saith, “I obtained, because ignorant I did it in unbelief.” <span
id="fr_3073"></span>[3074](#fn_3073.md) Then a little afterwards, “Faithful
the saying is, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came
into the world to save sinners, of whom I am first.” <span
id="fr_3074"></span>[3075](#fn_3074.md) Were there before him not any
sinners? What then, was he the first then? Yea, going before all men not
in time, but in evil disposition. “But therefore,” he saith, “mercy I
obtained,” in order that in me Christ Jesus might show all
long-suffering, for the imitation of those that shall believe in Him
unto life eternal: that is, every sinner and unjust man, already
despairing of himself, already having the mind of a gladiator, <span
id="fr_3075"></span>[3076](#fn_3075.md) so as to do whatsoever he willeth,
because he must needs be condemned, may yet observe the Apostle Paul, to
whom so great cruelty and so very evil a disposition was forgiven by
God; and by not despairing of himself may he be turned unto God. This
grace God doth commend to us in this Psalm also.…

<span id="ii.LXXI-p8"></span>2. The title then of this Psalm is, as
usual, a title intimating on the threshold what is being done in the
house: “To David himself for the sons of Jonadab, and for those that
were first led captive.” Jonadab (he is commended to us in the prophecy
of Jeremiah) was a certain man, who had enjoined his sons not to drink
wine, and not to dwell in houses, but in tents. But the commandment of
the father the sons kept and observed, and by this earned a blessing
from the Lord. <span id="fr_3076"></span>[3077](#fn_3076.md) Now the Lord
had not commanded this, but their own father. But they so received it as
though it were a commandment from the Lord their God; for even though
the Lord had not commanded that they should drink no wine and should
dwell in tents; yet the Lord had commanded that sons should obey their
father. In this case alone a son ought not to obey his father, if his
father should have commanded anything contrary to the Lord his God. For
indeed the father ought not to be angry, when God is preferred before
him. But when a father doth command that which is not contrary to God;
he must be heard as God is: because to obey one’s father God hath
enjoined. God then blessed the sons of Jonadab because of their
obedience, and thrust them in the teeth of His disobedient people,
reproaching them, because while the sons of Jonadab were obedient to
their father, they obeyed not their God. But while Jeremiah was treating
of these topics, he had this object in regard to the people of Israel,
that they should prepare themselves to be led for captivity into
Babylon, and should not hope for any other thing, but that they were to
be captives. The title then of this Psalm seemeth from thence to have
taken its hue, so that when he had said, “Of the sons of Jonadab;” he
added, “and of them that were first led captive:” not that the sons of
Jonadab were led captive, but because to them that were to be led
captive there were <span id="page_316">p. 316</span> <span
id="ii.LXXI-Page_316"></span>opposed the sons of Jonadab, because they
were obedient to their father: in order that they might understand that
they had been made captive, because they were not obedient to God. It is
added also that Jonadab is interpreted, “the Lord’s spontaneous one.”
What is this, the Lord’s spontaneous one? Serving God freely with the
will. What is, the Lord’s spontaneous one? “In me are, O God, Thy vows,
which I will render of praise to Thee.”  <span
id="fr_3077"></span>[3078](#fn_3077.md) What is, the Lord’s spontaneous
one? “Voluntarily I will sacrifice to Thee.” <span
id="fr_3078"></span>[3079](#fn_3078.md) For if the Apostolic teaching
admonisheth a slave to serve a human master, not as though of necessity,
but of good will, and by freely serving make himself in heart free; how
much more must God be served with whole and full and free will, who
seeth thy very will?…The first man made us captive, the second man hath
delivered us from captivity. “For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ
all shall be made alive.” But in Adam they die through the flesh’s
nativity, in Christ they are delivered through the heart’s faith. It was
not in thy power not to be born of Adam: it is in thy power to believe
in Christ. Howsoever much then thou shalt have willed to belong to the
first man, unto captivity thou wilt belong. And what is, shalt have
willed to belong? or what is, shalt belong? Already thou belongest: cry
out, “Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?” <span
id="fr_3079"></span>[3080](#fn_3079.md) Let us hear then this man crying
out this.

<span id="ii.LXXI-p13"></span>3. “O God, in Thee I have hoped, O Lord, I
shall not be confounded for everlasting” ([Psa.
71.1](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#001)<span id="ii.LXXI-p13.1"></span>.md).
Already I have been confounded, but not for everlasting. For how is he
not confounded, to whom is said, “What fruit had ye in these things
wherein ye now blush?” <span id="fr_3080"></span>[3081](#fn_3080.md) What
then shall be done, that we may not be confounded for everlasting? “Draw
near unto Him, and be ye enlightened, and your faces shall not
blush.” <span id="fr_3081"></span>[3082](#fn_3081.md) Confounded ye are in
Adam, withdraw from Adam, draw near unto Christ, and then ye shall not
be confounded. “In Thee I have hoped, O Lord, I shall not be confounded
for everlasting.” If in myself I am now <span
id="fr_3082"></span>[3083](#fn_3082.md) confounded, in Thee I shall not be
confounded for everlasting.

<span id="ii.LXXI-p17"></span>4. “In Thine own righteousness deliver me,
and save me” ([Psa. 71.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#002.md)<span
id="ii.LXXI-p17.1"></span>). Not in mine own, but in Thine own: for if
in mine own, I shall be one of those whereof he saith, “Being ignorant
of God’s righteousness, and their own righteousness willing to
establish, to the righteousness of God they were not made
subject.” <span id="fr_3083"></span>[3084](#fn_3083.md) Therefore, “in
Thine own righteousness,” not in mine. For mine is what? Iniquity hath
gone before. And when I shall be righteous, Thine own righteousness it
will be: for by righteousness given to me by Thee I shall be righteous;
and it shall be so mine, as that it be Thine, that is, given to me by
Thee. For I believe on Him that justifieth an ungodly man, so that my
faith is counted for righteousness. <span
id="fr_3084"></span>[3085](#fn_3084.md) Even so then the righteousness
shall be mine, not however as though mine own, not as though by mine own
self given to myself: as they thought who through the letter made their
boast, and rejected grace.…It is a small thing then that thou
acknowledge the good thing which is in thee to be from God, unless also
on that account thou exalt not thyself above him that hath not yet, who
perchance when he shall have received, will outstrip thee. For when Saul
was a stoner of Stephen, <span id="fr_3085"></span>[3086](#fn_3085.md) how
many were the Christians of whom he was persecutor! Nevertheless, when
he was converted, all that had gone before he surpassed. Therefore say
thou to God that which thou hearest in the Psalm, “In Thee I have hoped,
O Lord, I shall not be confounded for everlasting: in Thine own
righteousness,” not in mine, “deliver me, and save me.” “Incline unto me
Thine ear.” This also is a confession of humility. He that saith,
“Incline unto me,” is confessing that he is lying like a sick man laid
at the feet of the Physician standing. Lastly, observe that it is a sick
man that is speaking: “Incline unto me Thine ear, and save me.”

<span id="ii.LXXI-p21"></span>5. “Be Thou unto me for a protecting God”
([Psa. 71.3](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#003.md)<span
id="ii.LXXI-p21.1"></span>). Let not the darts of the enemy reach unto
me: for I am not able to protect myself. And a small thing is
“protecting:” he hath added, “and for a walled place, that Thou mayest
save me.” “For a walled place” be Thou to me, be Thou my walled
place.…Behold, God Himself hath become the place of thy fleeing unto,
who at first was the fearful object of thy fleeing from. “For a walled
place,” he saith, be Thou to me, “that Thou mayest save me.” I shall not
be safe except in Thee: except Thou shalt have been my rest, my sickness
shall not be able to be made whole. Lift me from the earth; upon Thee I
will lie, in order that I may rise unto a walled place. What can be
better walled? When unto that place thou shalt have fled for refuge,
tell me what adversaries thou wilt dread? Who will lie in wait, and come
at thee? A certain man is said from the summit of a mountain to have
cried out, when an Emperor was passing by, “I speak not <span
id="fr_3086"></span>[3087](#fn_3086.md) of thee:” the other is said to have
looked back and to have said, “Nor I of thee.” He had despised an
Emperor with glittering arms, with mighty army. From whence? From a
strong place. If he was secure on a high spot of earth, how secure art
thou on Him by whom heaven <span id="page_317">p. 317</span> <span
id="ii.LXXI-Page_317"></span>and earth were made? I, if for myself I
shall have chosen another place, shall not be able to be safe. Choose
thou indeed, O man, if thou shalt have found one, a place better walled.
There is not then a place whither to flee from Him, except we flee to
Him. If thou wilt escape Him angry, flee to Him appeased. “For my
firmament and my refuge Thou art.” “My firmament” is what? Through Thee
I am firm, and by Thee I am firm. “For my firmament and my refuge Thou
art:” in order that I may be made firm by Thee, in whatever respects I
shall have been made infirm in myself, I will flee for refuge unto Thee.
For firm the grace of Christ maketh thee, and immovable against all
temptations of the enemy. But there is there too human frailness, there
is there still the first captivity, there is there too the law in the
members fighting against the law of the mind, and willing to lead
captive in the law of sin: <span id="fr_3087"></span>[3088](#fn_3087.md)
still the body which is corrupt presseth down the soul. <span
id="fr_3088"></span>[3089](#fn_3088.md) Howsoever firm thou be by the grace
of God, so long as thou still bearest an earthly vessel, wherein the
treasure of God is, something must be dreaded even from that same vessel
of clay. <span id="fr_3089"></span>[3090](#fn_3089.md) Therefore “my
firmament Thou art,” in order that I may be firm in this world against
all temptations. But if many they are, and they trouble me: “my refuge
Thou art.” For I will confess mine infirmity, to the end that I may be
timid like a “hare,” because I am full of thorns like a “hedgehog.” And
as in another Psalm is said, “The rock is a refuge for the hedgehogs and
the hares:” <span id="fr_3090"></span>[3091](#fn_3090.md) but the Rock was
Christ. <span id="fr_3091"></span>[3092](#fn_3091.md)

<span id="ii.LXXI-p28"></span>6. “O God, deliver me from the hand of the
sinner” ([Psa. 71.4](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#004.md)<span
id="ii.LXXI-p28.1"></span>). Generally, sinners, among whom is toiling
he that is now to be delivered from captivity: he that now crieth,
“Unhappy man I, who shall deliver me from the body of this death? The
grace of God through Jesus Christ our Lord.” <span
id="fr_3092"></span>[3093](#fn_3092.md) Within is a foe, that law in the
members; there are without also enemies: unto what cryest thou? Unto
Him, to whom hath been cried, “From my secret sins cleanse me, O Lord,
and from strange sins spare Thy servant.” <span
id="fr_3093"></span>[3094](#fn_3093.md) …But these sinners are of two
kinds: there are some that have received Law, there are others that have
not received: all the heathen have not received Law, all Jews and
Christians have received Law. Therefore the general term is sinner;
either a transgressor of the Law, if he hath received Law; or only
unjust without Law, if he hath not received the Law. Of both kinds
speaketh the Apostle, and saith, “They that without Law have sinned,
without Law shall perish, and they that in the Law have sinned, by the
Law shall be judged.” <span id="fr_3094"></span>[3095](#fn_3094.md) But
thou that amid both kinds dost groan, say to God that which thou hearest
in the Psalm, “My God, deliver me from the hand of the sinner.” Of what
sinner? “From the hand of him that transgresseth the Law, and of the
unjust man.” He that transgresseth the Law is indeed also unjust; for
not unjust he is not, that transgresseth the Law: but every one that
transgresseth the Law is unjust, not every unjust man doth transgress
the Law. For, “Where there is not a Law,” saith the Apostle, “neither is
there transgression.” <span id="fr_3095"></span>[3096](#fn_3095.md) They
then that have not received Law, may be called unjust, transgressors
they cannot be called. Both are judged after their deservings. But I
that from captivity will to be delivered through Thy grace, cry to Thee,
“Deliver me from the hand of the sinner.” What is, from the hand of him?
From the power of him, that while he is raging, he lead me not unto
consenting with him; that while he lieth in wait, he persuade not to
iniquity. “From the hand of the sinner and of the unjust man.”…

<span id="ii.LXXI-p33"></span>7. Lastly, there followeth the reason why
I say this: “for Thou art my patience” ([Psa.
71.5](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#005)<span id="ii.LXXI-p33.1"></span>.md).
Now if He is patience rightly, He is that also which followeth, “O Lord,
my hope from my youth.” My patience, because my hope: or rather my hope,
because my patience. “Tribulation,” saith the Apostle, “worketh
patience, patience probation, but probation hope, but hope confoundeth
not.”  <span id="fr_3096"></span>[3097](#fn_3096.md) With reason in Thee I
have hoped, O Lord, I shall not be confounded for everlasting. “O Lord,
my hope from my youth.” From thy youth is God thy hope? Is He not also
from thy boyhood, and from thine infancy? Certainly, saith he. For see
what followeth, that thou mayest not think that I have said this, “my
hope from my youth,” as if God noways profited mine infancy or my
boyhood; hear what followeth: “In Thee I have been strengthened from the
womb.” Hear yet: “From the belly of my mother Thou art my Protector”
([Psa. 71.6](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#006.md)<span
id="ii.LXXI-p34.2"></span>). Why then, “from my youth,” except it was
the period from which I began to hope in Thee? For before in Thee I was
not hoping, though Thou wast my Protector, that didst lead me safe unto
the time, when I learned to hope in Thee. But from my youth I began in
Thee to hope, from the time when Thou didst arm me against the Devil, so
that in the girding of Thy host being armed with Thy faith, love, hope,
and the rest of Thy gifts, I waged conflict against Thine invisible
enemies, and heard from the Apostle, “There is not for us a wrestling
against flesh and blood, but against principalities, and powers,”
etc. <span id="fr_3097"></span>[3098](#fn_3097.md) There a young man it is
that doth fight against these <span id="page_318">p. 318</span> <span
id="ii.LXXI-Page_318"></span>things: but though he be a young man, he
falleth, unless He be the hope of Him to whom he crieth, “O Lord, my
hope from my youth.” “In Thee is my singing alway.” Is it only from the
time when I began to hope in Thee until now? Nay, but “alway.” What is,
“alway”? Not only in the time of faith, but also in the time of sight.
For now, “So long as we are in the body we are absent from the Lord: for
by faith we walk, not by sight:” <span
id="fr_3098"></span>[3099](#fn_3098.md) there will be a time when we shall
see that which being not seen we believe: but when that hath been seen
which we believe, we shall rejoice: but when that hath been seen which
they believed not, ungodly men shall be confounded. Then will come the
substance whereof there is now the hope. But, “Hope which is seen is not
hope. But if that which we see not we hope for, through patience we wait
for it.” <span id="fr_3099"></span>[3100](#fn_3099.md) Now then thou
groanest, now unto a place of refuge thou runnest, in order that thou
mayest be saved; now being in infirmity thou entreatest the Physician:
what, when thou shalt have received perfect soundness also, what when
thou shall have been made “equal to the Angels of God,” <span
id="fr_3100"></span>[3101](#fn_3100.md) wilt thou then perchance forget
that grace, whereby thou hast been delivered? Far be it.

<span id="ii.LXXI-p39"></span>8. “As it were a monster I have become
unto many” ([Psa. 71.7](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#007.md)<span
id="ii.LXXI-p39.1"></span>). Here in time of hope, in time of groaning,
in time of humiliation, in time of sorrow, in time of infirmity, in time
of the voice from the fetters—here then what? “As it were a monster I
have become unto many.” Why, “As it were a monster”? Why do they insult
me that think me a monster? Because I believe that which I see not. For
they being happy in those things which they see, exult in drink, in
wantonness, in chamberings, in covetousness, in riches, in robberies, in
secular dignities, in the whitening of a mud wall, in these things they
exult: but I walk in a different way, contemning those things which are
present, and fearing even the prosperous things of the world, and secure
in no other thing but the promises of God. And they, “Let us eat and
drink, for to-morrow we die.” <span id="fr_3101"></span>[3102](#fn_3101.md)
What sayest thou? Repeat it: “let us eat,” he saith, “and drink.” Come
now, what hast thou said afterwards? “for to-morrow we die.” Thou hast
terrified, not led me astray. Certainly by the very thing which thou
hast said afterwards, thou hast stricken me with fear to consent with
thee. “For to-morrow we die,” thou hast said: and there hath preceded,
“Let us eat and drink.” For when thou hadst said, “Let us eat and
drink;” thou didst add, “for to-morrow we die.” Hear the other side from
me, “Yea let us fast and pray, ‘for to-morrow we die.’” I keeping this
way, strait and narrow, “as it were a monster have become unto many: but
Thou art a strong helper.” Be Thou with me, O Lord Jesus, to say to me,
faint not in the narrow way, I first have gone along it, I am the way
itself, <span id="fr_3102"></span>[3103](#fn_3102.md) I lead, in Myself I
lead, unto Myself I lead home. Therefore though “a monster I have become
unto many;” nevertheless I will not fear, for “Thou art a strong
Helper.”

<span id="ii.LXXI-p42"></span>9. “Let my mouth be fulfilled with praise,
that with hymn I may tell of Thy glory, all the day long Thy
magnificence” ([Psa. 71.8](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#008.md)<span
id="ii.LXXI-p42.1"></span>). What is “all the day long”? Without
intermission. In prosperity, because Thou dost comfort: in adversity,
because Thou dost correct: before I was in being, because Thou didst
make; when I was in being, because Thou didst give health: when I had
sinned, because Thou didst forgive; when I was converted, because Thou
didst help; when I had persevered, because Thou didst crown.

<span id="ii.LXXI-p43"></span>10. My hope from my youth, “cast me not
away in time of old age” ([Psa.
71.9](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#009)<span id="ii.LXXI-p43.1"></span>.md).
What is this time of old age? “When my strength shall fail, forsake Thou
not me.” Here God maketh this answer to thee, yea indeed let thy
strength fail, in order that in thee mine may abide: in order that thou
mayest say with the Apostle, “When I am made weak, then I am
mighty.” <span id="fr_3103"></span>[3104](#fn_3103.md) Fear not, that thou
be cast away in that weakness, in that old age. But why? Was not thy
Lord made weak on the Cross? Did not most mighty men and fat bulls
before Him, as though a man of no strength, made captive and oppressed,
shake the head and say, “If Son of God He is, let Him come down from the
Cross”? <span id="fr_3104"></span>[3105](#fn_3104.md) Has he deserted
because He was made weak, who preferred not to come down from the Cross,
lest He should seem not to have displayed power, but to have yielded to
them reviling? What did He hanging teach thee, that would not come down,
but patience amid men reviling, but that thou shouldest be strong in thy
God? Perchance too in His person was said, “As it were a monster I have
become unto many, and Thou art a strong Helper.” <span
id="fr_3105"></span>[3106](#fn_3105.md) In His person according to His
weakness, not according to His power; according to that whereby He had
transformed us into Himself, not according to that wherein He had
Himself come down. For He became a monster unto many. And perchance the
same was the old age of Him; because on account of its oldness it is not
improperly called old age, and the Apostle saith, “Our old man hath been
crucified together with Him.” <span id="fr_3106"></span>[3107](#fn_3106.md)
If there was there our old man, old age was there; because old, old
age. <span id="fr_3107"></span>[3108](#fn_3107.md) Nevertheless, because a
true saying is, “Renewed <span id="page_319">p. 319</span> <span
id="ii.LXXI-Page_319"></span>as an eagle’s shall be Thy youth;” <span
id="fr_3108"></span>[3109](#fn_3108.md) He rose Himself the third day,
promised a resurrection at the end of the world. Already there hath gone
before the Head, the members are to follow. Why dost thou fear lest He
should forsake thee, lest He cast thee away for the time of old age,
when thy strength shall have failed? Yea at that time in thee will be
the strength of Him, when thy strength shall have failed.

<span id="ii.LXXI-p50"></span>11. Why do I say this? “For mine enemies
have spoken against me, and they that were keeping watch for My soul,
have taken counsel together ([Psa.
71.10](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#010.md)<span
id="ii.LXXI-p50.1"></span>): saying, God hath forsaken Him, persecute
Him, and seize Him, for there is no one to deliver Him” ([Psa.
71.11](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#011.md)<span
id="ii.LXXI-p50.2"></span>). This hath been said concerning Christ. For
He that with the great power of Divinity, wherein He is equal to the
Father, had raised to life dead persons, on a sudden in the hands of
enemies became weak, and as if having no power, was seized. When would
He have been seized, except they had first said in their heart, “God
hath forsaken Him?” Whence there was that voice on the Cross, “My God,
My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?”  <span
id="fr_3109"></span>[3110](#fn_3109.md) So then did God forsake Christ,
though “God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself,” <span
id="fr_3110"></span>[3111](#fn_3110.md) though Christ was also God, out of
the Jews indeed according to the flesh, “Who is over all things, God
blessed for ever,” <span id="fr_3111"></span>[3112](#fn_3111.md) —did God
forsake Him? Far be it. But in our old man our voice it was, because our
old man was crucified together with Him: <span
id="fr_3112"></span>[3113](#fn_3112.md) and of that same our old man He had
taken a Body, because Mary was of Adam. Therefore the very thing which
they thought, from the Cross He said, “Why hast Thou forsaken Me?” <span
id="fr_3113"></span>[3114](#fn_3113.md) Why do these men think Me left
alone to their evil? What is, think Me forsaken in their evil? “For if
they had known, the Lord of glory they had never crucified. <span
id="fr_3114"></span>[3115](#fn_3114.md) Persecute and seize Him.” More
familiarly however, brethren, let us take this of the members of Christ,
and acknowledge our own voice in these words: because even He used such
words in our person, not in His own power and majesty; but in that which
He became for our sakes, not according to that which He was, who hath
made us.

<span id="ii.LXXI-p57"></span>12. “O Lord, my God, be not far from me”
([Psa. 71.12](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#012.md)<span
id="ii.LXXI-p57.1"></span>). So it is, and the Lord is not far off at
all. For, “The Lord is nigh unto them that have bruised the
heart.” <span id="fr_3115"></span>[3116](#fn_3115.md) “My God, unto my help
look Thou.” “Be they confounded and fail that engage <span
id="fr_3116"></span>[3117](#fn_3116.md) my soul” ([Psa.
71.13](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#013.md)<span
id="ii.LXXI-p59.1"></span>). What hath he desired? “Be they confounded
and fail.” Why hath he desired it? “That engage my soul”? What is, “That
engage my soul”? Engaging as it were unto some quarrel. For they are
said to be engaged that are challenged to quarrel. If then so it is, let
us beware of men that engage our soul. What is, “That engage our soul”?
First provoking us to withstand God, in order that in our evil things
God may displease us. For when art thou right, so that to thee the God
of Israel may be good, good to men right in heart? <span
id="fr_3117"></span>[3118](#fn_3117.md) When art thou right? Wilt thou
hear? When in that good which thou doest, God is pleasing to thee; but
in that evil which thou sufferest, God is not displeasing to thee. See
ye what I have said, brethren, and be ye on your guard against men that
engage your souls. For all men that deal with you in order to make you
be wearied in sorrows and tribulations, have this aim, namely, that God
may be displeasing to you in that which ye suffer, and there may go
forth from your mouth, “What is this? For what have I done?” Now then
hast thou done nothing of evil, and art thou just, He unjust? A sinner I
am, thou sayest, I confess, just I call not myself. But what, sinner,
hast thou by any means done so much evil as he with whom it is well? As
much as Gaiuseius? <span id="fr_3118"></span>[3119](#fn_3118.md) I know the
evil doings of him, I know the iniquities of him, from which I, though a
sinner, am very far; and yet I see him abounding in all good things, and
I am suffering so great evil things. I do not then say, O God, “what
have I done” to Thee, because I have done nothing at all of evil; but
because I have not done so much as to deserve to suffer these things.
Again, art thou just, He unjust? Wake up, wretched man, thy soul hath
been engaged! I have not, he saith, called myself just. What then sayest
thou? A sinner I am, but I did not commit so great sins, as to deserve
to suffer these things. Thou sayest not then to God, just I am, and Thou
art unjust: but thou sayest, unjust I am, but Thou art more unjust.
Behold thy soul hath been engaged, behold now thy soul wageth war. What?
Against whom? Thy soul, against God; that which hath been made against
Him by whom it was made. Even because thou art in being to cry out
against Him, thou art ungrateful. Return, then, to the confession of thy
sickness, and beg the healing hand of the Physician. Think thou not they
are happy who flourish for a time. Thou art being chastised, they are
being spared: perchance for thee chastised and amended an inheritance is
being kept in reserve.…Lastly, see what followeth, “Let them put on
confusion and shame, that think evil things to me.” “Confusion and
shame,” confusion because of a bad conscience, shame because of modesty.
Let this befall them, and they will be good.…

<span id="ii.LXXI-p62"></span><span id="page_320">p. 320</span> <span
id="ii.LXXI-Page_320"></span>13. “But I alway in Thee will hope, and
will add to all Thy praise” ([Psa.
71.14](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#014.md)<span
id="ii.LXXI-p62.1"></span>). What is this? “I will add to all Thy
praise,” ought to move us. More perfect wilt thou make the praise of
God? Is there anything to be superadded? If already that is all praise,
wilt thou add anything? God was praised in all His good deeds, in every
creature of His, in the whole establishment of all things, in the
government and regulation of ages, in the order of seasons, in the
height of Heaven, in the fruitfulness of the regions of earth, in the
encircling of the sea, in every excellency of the creature everywhere
brought forth, in the sons of men themselves, in the giving of the Law,
in delivering His people from the captivity of the Egyptians, and all
the rest of His wonderful works: not yet He had been praised for having
raised up flesh unto life eternal. Be there then this praise added by
the Resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ: in order that here we may
perceive His voice above all past praise: thus it is that we rightly
understand this also.…

<span id="ii.LXXI-p63"></span>14. “My mouth shall tell out Thy
righteousness” ([Psa. 71.15](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#015.md)<span
id="ii.LXXI-p63.1"></span>): not mine. From thence I will add to all Thy
praise: because even that I am righteous, if righteous I am, is Thy
righteousness in me, not mine own: for Thou dost justify the
ungodly. <span id="fr_3119"></span>[3120](#fn_3119.md) “All the day long
Thy salvation.” What is, “Thy salvation”? Let no one assume to himself,
that he saveth himself, “Of the Lord is Salvation.” <span
id="fr_3120"></span>[3121](#fn_3120.md) Not any one by himself saveth
himself, “Vain is man’s salvation.” <span
id="fr_3121"></span>[3122](#fn_3121.md) “All the day long Thy Salvation:”
at all times. Something of adversity cometh, preach the Salvation of the
Lord: something of prosperity cometh, preach the Salvation of the Lord.
Do not preach in prosperity, and hold thy peace in adversity: otherwise
there will not be that which hath been said, “all the day long.” For all
the day long is day together with its own night. Do we when we say, for
example, thirty days have gone by, mention the nights also; do we not
under the very term days include the nights also? In Genesis what was
said? “The evening was made, and the morning was made, one day.” <span
id="fr_3122"></span>[3123](#fn_3122.md) Therefore a whole day is the day
together with its own night: for the night doth serve the day, not the
day the night. Whatever thou doest in mortal flesh, ought to serve
righteousness: whatever thou doest by the commandment of God, be it not
done for the sake of the advantage of the flesh, lest day serve night.
Therefore all the day long speak of the praise of God, to wit, in
prosperity and in adversity; in prosperity, as though in the day time;
in adversity, as though in the night time: all the day long nevertheless
speak of the praise of God, so that thou mayest not have sung to no
purpose, “I will bless God at every time, alway the praise of Him is in
my mouth.” <span id="fr_3123"></span>[3124](#fn_3123.md) …

<span id="ii.LXXI-p69"></span>15. Therefore, he saith, “For I have not
known tradings.” <span id="fr_3124"></span>[3125](#fn_3124.md) What are
these tradings? Let traders hear and change their life; and if they have
been such, be not such; let them not know what they have been, let them
forget; lastly, let them not approve, not praise; let them disapprove,
condemn, be changed, if trading is a sin. For on this account, O thou
trader, because of a certain eagerness for getting, whenever thou shalt
have suffered loss, thou wilt blaspheme; and there will not be in thee
that which hath been spoken of, “all the day long Thy praise.” But
whenever for the price of the goods which thou art selling, thou not
only liest, but even falsely swearest; how in thy mouth all the day long
is there the praise of God? While, if thou art a Christian, even out of
thy mouth the name of God is being blasphemed, so that men say, see what
sort of men are Christians! Therefore if this man for this reason
speaketh the praise of God all the day long, because he hath not known
tradings; let Christians amend themselves, let them not trade. But a
trader saith to me, behold I bring indeed from a distant quarter
merchandise unto these places, wherein there are not those things which
I have brought, by which means I may gain a living: I ask but as reward
for my labour, that I may sell dearer than I have bought: for whence can
I live, when it hath been written, “the worker is worthy of his
reward”? <span id="fr_3125"></span>[3126](#fn_3125.md) But he is treating
of lying, of false swearing. This is the fault of me, not of trading:
for I should not, if I would, be unable to do without this fault. I
then, the merchant, do not shift mine own fault to trading: but if I
lie, it is I that lie, not the trade. For I might say, for so much I
bought, but for so much I will sell; if thou pleasest, buy. For the
buyer hearing this truth would not be offended, and not a whit less all
men would resort to me: because they would love truth more than gain. Of
this then, he saith, admonish me, that I lie not, that I forswear not;
not to relinquish business whereby I maintain myself. For to what dost
thou put me when thou puttest me away from this? Perchance to some
craft? I will be a shoemaker, I will make shoes for men. Are not they
too liars? are not they too false-swearers? Do they not, when they have
contracted to make shoes for one man, when they have received money from
another man, give up that which they were making, and undertake to make
for another, and deceive him for whom they have promised to make
speedily? Do they not often say, to-day I am about it, to-day I’ll get
<span id="page_321">p. 321</span> <span
id="ii.LXXI-Page_321"></span>them done? Secondly, in the very sewing do
they not commit as many frauds? These are their doings and these are
their sayings: but they are themselves evil, not the calling which they
profess. All evil artificers, then, not fearing God, either for gain, or
for fear of loss or want, do lie, do forswear themselves; there is no
continual praise of God in them. How then dost thou withdraw me from
trading? Wouldest thou that I be a farmer, and murmur against God
thundering, so that, fearing hail, I consult a wizard, in order to learn
what to do to protect me against the weather; so that I desire famine
for the poor, in order that I may be able to sell what I have kept in
store? Unto this dost thou bring me? But good farmers, thou sayest, do
not such things. Nor do good traders do those things. But why, even to
have sons is an evil thing, for when their head is in pain, evil and
unbelieving mothers seek for impious charms and incantations? These are
the sins of men, not of things. A trader might thus speak to me—Look
then, O Bishop, how thou understand the tradings which thou hast read in
the Psalm: lest perchance thou understand not, and yet forbid me
trading. Admonish me then how I should live; if well, it shall be well
with me: one thing however I know, that if I shall have been evil, it is
not trading that maketh me so, but my iniquity. Whenever truth is
spoken, there is nothing to be said against it.

<span id="ii.LXXI-p72"></span>16. Let us inquire then what he hath
called tradings, which indeed he that hath not known, all the day long
doth praise God. Trading <span id="fr_3126"></span>[3127](#fn_3126.md) even
in the Greek language is derived from action, and in the Latin from want
of inaction: but whether it be from action or want of inaction, let us
examine what it is. For they that are active traders, rely as it were
upon their own action, they praise their works, they attain not to the
grace of God. Therefore traders are opposed to that grace which this
Psalm doth commend. For it doth commend that grace, in order that no one
may boast of his own works. Because in a certain place is said,
“Physicians shall not raise to life,” <span
id="fr_3127"></span>[3128](#fn_3127.md) ought men to abandon medicine? But
what is this? Under this name are understood proud men, promising
salvation to men, whereas “of the Lord is Salvation.” <span
id="fr_3128"></span>[3129](#fn_3128.md) …With reason the Lord drave from
the Temple them to whom He said, “It is written, My House shall be
called the House of prayer, but ye have made it a house of
trading;” <span id="fr_3129"></span>[3130](#fn_3129.md) that is, boasting
of your works, seeking no inaction, nor hearing the Scripture speaking
against your unrest and trading, “be ye still, and see that I am the
Lord.” <span id="fr_3130"></span>[3131](#fn_3130.md) …

<span id="ii.LXXI-p78"></span>17. But there is in some copies, “For I
have not known literature.” Where some books have “trading,” there
others “literature:” how they may accord is a hard matter to find out;
and yet the discrepancy of interpreters perchance showeth the meaning,
introduceth no error. Let us inquire then how to understand literature
also, lest we offend grammarians in the same way as we did traders a
little before: because a grammarian too may live honourably in his
calling, and neither forswear nor lie. Let us examine then the
literature which he hath not known, in whose mouth all the day long is
the praise of God. There is a sort of literature of the Jews: for to
them let us refer this; there we shall find what hath been said: just as
when we were inquiring about traders, on the score of actions and works,
we found that to be called detestable trading, which the Apostle hath
branded, saying, “For being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and willing
to establish their own, to the righteousness of God they were not made
subject.” <span id="fr_3131"></span>[3132](#fn_3131.md) …Just as then we
found out the former charge against traders, that is men boasting of
action, exalting themselves because of business which admitteth no
inaction, unquiet men rather than good workmen; because good workmen are
those in whom God worketh; so also we find a sort of literature among
the Jews.…Moses wrote five books: but in the five porches encircling the
pool, <span id="fr_3132"></span>[3133](#fn_3132.md) sick men were lying,
but they could not be healed. See how the letter remained, convicting
the guilty, not saving the unrighteous. For in those five porches, a
figure of the five books, sick men were given over rather than made
whole. What then in that place did make whole a sick man? The moving of
the water. When that pool was moved there went down a sick man, and
there was made whole one, one <span id="fr_3133"></span>[3134](#fn_3133.md)
because of unity: whatsoever other man went down unto that same moving
was not made whole. How then was there commended the unity of the Body
crying from the ends of the earth? Another man was not healed, except
again the pool were moved. The moving of the pool then did signify the
perturbation of the people of the Jews when the Lord Jesus Christ came.
For at the coming of an Angel the water in the pool was perceived to be
moved. The water then encircled with five porches was the Jewish nation
encircled by the Law. And in the porches the sick lay, and in the water
alone when troubled and moved they were healed. The Lord came, troubled
was the water; He was crucified, may He come down in order that the sick
man may be made whole. What is, may He come down? May He humble Himself.
Therefore whosoever ye be that <span id="page_322">p. 322</span> <span
id="ii.LXXI-Page_322"></span>love the letter without grace, in the
porches ye will remain, sick ye will be, lying ill, not growing
well.…For the same figure also it is that Eliseus at first sent a staff
by his servant to raise up the dead child. There had died the son of a
widow his hostess; it was reported to him, to his servant he gave his
staff: go thou, he saith, lay it on the dead child. Did the prophet not
know what he was doing? The servant went before, he laid the staff upon
the dead, the dead arose not. “For if there had been given a law which
could have made alive, surely out of the law there had been
righteousness.”  <span id="fr_3134"></span>[3135](#fn_3134.md) The law sent
by the servant made not alive: and yet he sent his staff by the servant,
who himself afterwards followed, and made alive. <span
id="fr_3135"></span>[3136](#fn_3135.md) For when that infant arose not,
Eliseus came himself, now bearing the type of the Lord, who had sent
before his servant with the staff, as though with the Law: he came to
the child that was lying dead, he laid his limbs upon it. The one was an
infant, the other a grown man: he contracted and shortened in a manner
the size of his full growth, in order that he might fit the dead child.
The dead then arose, when he being alive adapted himself to the dead:
and the Master did that which the staff did not; and grace did that
which the letter did not. They then that have remained in the staff,
glory in the letter; and therefore are not made alive. But I will to
glory concerning Thy grace.…In that same grace I glorying “literature
have not known:” that is, men on the letter relying, and from grace
recoiling, with whole heart I have rejected.

<span id="ii.LXXI-p84"></span>18. With reason there followeth, “I will
enter into the power of the Lord:” not mine own, but the Lord’s. For
they gloried in their own power of the letter, therefore grace joined to
the letter they knew not.…But because “the letter killeth, but the
Spirit maketh alive:” <span id="fr_3136"></span>[3137](#fn_3136.md) “I have
not known literature, and I will enter into the power of the Lord.”
Therefore this verse following doth strengthen and perfect the sense, so
as to fix it in the hearts of men, and not suffer any other
interpretation to steal in from any quarter. “O Lord, I will be mindful
of Thy righteousness alone” ([Psa.
71.16](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#016.md)<span
id="ii.LXXI-p85.2"></span>). Ah! “alone.” Why hath he added “alone,” I
ask you? It would suffice to say, “I will be mindful of Thy
righteousness.” “alone,” he saith, entirely: there of mine own I think
not. “For what hast thou which thou hast not received? But if also thou
hast received, why dost thou glory as if thou hast not received.” <span
id="fr_3137"></span>[3138](#fn_3137.md) Thy righteousness alone doth
deliver me, what is mine own alone is nought but sins. May I not glory
then of my own strength, may I not remain in the letter; may I reject
“literature,” that is, men glorying of the letter, and on their own
strength perversely, like men frantic, relying: may I reject such men,
may I enter into the power of the Lord, so that when I am weak, then I
may be mighty; in order that Thou in me mayest be mighty, for, “I will
be mindful of Thy righteousness alone.”

<span id="ii.LXXI-p87"></span>19. “O God, Thou hast taught me from my
youth” ([Psa. 71.17](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#017.md)<span
id="ii.LXXI-p87.1"></span>). What hast thou taught me? That of Thy
righteousness alone I ought to be mindful. For reviewing my past life, I
see what was owing to me, and what I have received instead of that which
was owing to me. There was owing punishment, there hath been paid grace:
there was owing hell, there hath been given life eternal. “O God, Thou
hast taught me from my youth.” From the very beginning of my faith,
wherewith Thou hast renewed me, Thou didst teach me that nothing had
preceded in me, whence I might say that there was owing to me what Thou
hast given. For who is turned to God save from iniquity? Who is redeemed
save from captivity? But who can say that unjust was his captivity, when
he forsook his Captain and fell off to the deserter? God is for our
Captain, <span id="fr_3138"></span>[3139](#fn_3138.md) the devil a
deserter: the Captain gave a commandment, the deserter suggested
guile: <span id="fr_3139"></span>[3140](#fn_3139.md) where were thine ears
between precept and deceit? was the devil better than God? Better he
that revolted <span id="fr_3140"></span>[3141](#fn_3140.md) than He that
made thee? Thou didst believe what the devil promised, and didst find
what God threatened. Now then out of captivity being delivered, still
however in hope, not yet in substance, walking by faith, not yet by
sight, “O God,” he saith, “Thou hast taught me from my youth.” From the
time that I have been turned to Thee, <span
id="fr_3141"></span>[3142](#fn_3141.md) renewed by Thee who had been made
by Thee, re-created who had been created, re-formed who had been formed:
from the time that I have been converted, I have learned that no merits
of mine have preceded, but that Thy grace hath come to me *gratis,* in
order that I might be mindful of Thy righteousness alone.

<span id="ii.LXXI-p92"></span>20. What next after youth? For, “Thou hast
taught me,” he saith, “from my youth:” what after youth? For in that
same first conversion of thine thou didst learn, how before conversion
thou wast not just, but iniquity preceded, in order that iniquity being
banished, there might succeed love: and having been renewed into a new
man, only in hope, not yet in substance, thou didst learn how nothing of
thy good had preceded, and by the grace of God thou wast converted to
God: now perchance since the time that thou hast been converted wilt
thou have anything of thine own, and on thy own <span id="page_323">p.
323</span> <span id="ii.LXXI-Page_323"></span>strength oughtest thou to
rely? Just as men are wont to say, now leave me, it was necessary for
thee to show me the way; it is sufficient, I will walk in the way. And
he that hath shown thee the way, “wilt thou not that I conduct thee to
the place?” But thou, if thou art conceited, “let me alone, it is
enough, I will walk in the way.” Thou art left, and through thy weakness
again thou wilt lose the way. Good were it for thee that He should have
conducted thee, who first put thee in the way. But unless He too lead
thee, again also thou wilt stray: say to Him then, “Conduct me, O Lord,
in Thy way, and I will walk in Thy truth.” <span
id="fr_3142"></span>[3143](#fn_3142.md) But thy having entered on the way,
is youth, the very renewal and beginning of the faith. For before thou
wast walking through thy own ways a vagabond; straying through woody
places, through rough places, torn in all thy limbs, thou wast seeking a
home, that is, a sort of settlement of thy spirit, where thou mightest
say, it is well; and being in security mightest say it, at rest from
every uneasiness, from every trial, in a word from every captivity; and
thou didst not find. What shall I say? Came there to thee one to show
thee the way? There came to thee the Way itself, and thou wast set
therein by no merits of thine preceding, for evidently thou wast
straying. What, since the time that thou hast set foot therein dost thou
now direct thyself? Doth He that hath taught thee the way now leave
thee? No, he saith: “Thou hast taught me from my youth; and even until
now I will tell forth Thy wonderful works.” For a wonderful thing is
that which still Thou doest; namely, that Thou dost direct me, who in
the way hast put me: and these are Thy wonderful works. What dost thou
think to be the wonderful works of God? What is more wonderful among
God’s wonderful works, than the raising the dead? But am I by any means
dead, thou sayest? Unless dead thou hadst been, there would not have
been said to thee, “Rise, thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead,
and Christ shall enlighten thee.” <span
id="fr_3143"></span>[3144](#fn_3143.md) Dead are all unbelievers, all
unrighteous men; in body they live, but in heart they are extinct. But
he that raiseth a man dead according to the body, doth bring him back to
see this light and to breathe this air: but he that raiseth is not
himself light and air to him; he beginneth to see, as he saw before. A
soul is not so resuscitated. For a soul is resuscitated by God; though
even a body is resuscitated by God: but God, when He doth resuscitate a
body, to the world doth bring it back: when He doth resuscitate a soul,
to Himself He bringeth it back. If the air of this world be withdrawn,
there dieth body: if God be withdrawn, there dieth soul. When then God
doth resuscitate a soul, unless there be with her He that hath
resuscitated, she being resuscitated liveth not. For He doth not
resuscitate, and then leave her to live to herself: in the same manner
as Lazarus, when he was resuscitated after being four days dead, was
resuscitated by the Lord’s corporal presence.…The Lord withdrew from
that same city or from that spot, did Lazarus cease to live? Not so is
the soul resuscitated: God doth resuscitate her, she dieth if God shall
have withdrawn. For I will speak boldly, brethren, but yet the truth.
Two lives there are, one of the body, another of the soul: as the life
of the body is the soul, so the life of the soul is God: in like manner
as, if the soul forsake, the body dieth: so the soul dieth, if God
forsake. This then is His grace, namely, that He resuscitate and be with
us. Because then He doth resuscitate us from our past death, and doth
renew in a manner our life, we say to Him, “O God, Thou hast taught me
from my youth.” But because He doth not withdraw from those whom He
resuscitateth, lest when He shall have withdrawn from them they die, we
say to Him, “and even until now I will tell forth Thy wonderful works:”
because while Thou art with me I live, and of my soul Thou art the life,
which will die if she be left to herself. Therefore while my life is
present, that is, my God, “even until now,” what next?

<span id="ii.LXXI-p95"></span>21. “And even unto oldness <span
id="fr_3144"></span>[3145](#fn_3144.md) and old age” <span
id="fr_3145"></span>[3146](#fn_3145.md) ([Psa.
71.18](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#018.md)<span
id="ii.LXXI-p97.1"></span>). These are two terms for old age, and are
distinguished by the Greeks. For the gravity succeeding youth hath
another name among the Greeks, and after that same gravity the last age
coming on hath another name; for <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.LXXI-p97.2"></span>πρεσβύτης</span> signifieth grave, and <span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.LXXI-p97.3"></span>γ™ρων</span> old. But
because in the Latin language the distinction of these two terms holdeth
not, both words implying old age are inserted, oldness and old age: but
ye know them to be two ages. “Thou hast taught me Thy grace from my
youth; and even until now;” after my youth, “I will tell forth Thy
wonderful works,” because Thou art with me in order that I may not die,
who hast come in order that I may rise: “and even unto oldness and old
age,” that is, even unto my last breath, unless with me Thou shalt have
been, there will not be any merit of mine; may Thy grace alway remain
with me. Even one man would say this, thou, he, I; but because this
voice is that of a certain great Man, that is, of the Unity itself, for
it is the voice of the Church; let us investigate the youth of the
Church. When Christ came, He was crucified, dead, rose again, called the
Gentiles, they began to be converted, became Martyrs strong in Christ,
there <span id="page_324">p. 324</span> <span
id="ii.LXXI-Page_324"></span>was shed faithful blood, there arose a
harvest for the Church: this is Her youth. But seasons advancing let the
Church confess, let Her say, “Even until now I will tell forth Thy
wonderful works.” Not only in youth, when Paul, when Peter, when the
first Apostles told: even in advancing age I myself, that is, Thy Unity,
Thy members, Thy Body, “will tell forth Thy marvellous works.” What
then? “And even unto oldness and old age,” I will tell forth Thy
wonderful works: even until the end of the world here shall be the
Church. For if She were not to be here even unto the end of the world;
to whom did the Lord say, “Behold, I am with you always, even unto the
consummation of the world”? Why was it necessary that these things
should be spoken in the Scriptures? Because there were to be enemies of
the Christian Faith who would say, “for a short time are the Christians,
hereafter they shall perish, and there shall come back idols, there
shall come back that which was before. How long shall be the
Christians?” <span id="fr_3146"></span>[3147](#fn_3146.md) “Even unto
oldness and old age:” that is, even unto the end of the world. When
thou, miserable unbeliever, dost expect Christians to pass away, thou
art passing away thyself without Christians: and Christians even unto
the end of the world shall endure; and as for thee with thine unbelief
when thou shalt have ended thy short life, with what face wilt thou come
forth to the Judge, whom while thou wast living thou didst blaspheme?
Therefore “from my youth, and even until now, and even unto oldness and
old age, O Lord, forsake not me.” It will not be, as mine enemies say,
even for a time. “Forsake not me, until I tell forth Thine arm to every
generation that is yet to come.” And the Arm of the Lord hath been
revealed to whom? <span id="fr_3147"></span>[3148](#fn_3147.md) The Arm of
the Lord is Christ. Do not Thou then forsake me: let not them rejoice
that say, “only for a set time the Christians are.” May there be persons
to tell forth Thine arm. To whom? “To every generation that is yet to
come.” If then it be to every generation that is yet to come, it will be
even unto the end of the world: for when the world is ended, no longer
any generation will come on.

<span id="ii.LXXI-p100"></span>22. “Thy power and Thy righteousness”
([Psa. 71.19](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#019.md)<span
id="ii.LXXI-p100.1"></span>). That is, that I may tell forth to every
generation that is yet to come, Thine arm. And what hath Thine arm
effected? This then let me tell forth, that same grace to every
generation succeeding: let me say to every man that is to be born,
nothing thou art by thyself, on God call thou, thine own are sins,
merits are God’s: <span id="fr_3148"></span>[3149](#fn_3148.md) punishment
to thee is owing, and when reward shall have come, His own gifts He will
crown, not thy merits. Let me say to every generation that is to come,
out of captivity thou hast come, unto Adam thou didst belong. Let me say
this to every generation that is to come, that there is no strength of
mine, no righteousness of mine; but “Thy strength and Thy righteousness,
O God, even unto the most high mighty works which Thou hast made.” “Thy
power and Thy righteousness,” as far as what? even unto flesh and blood?
Nay, “even unto the most high mighty works which Thou hast made.” For
the high places are the heavens, in the high places are the Angels,
Thrones, Dominions, Principalities, Powers: to Thee they owe it that
they are; to Thee they owe it that they live, to Thee they owe it that
righteously they live, to Thee they owe it that blessedly they live.
“Thy power and Thy righteousness,” as far as what? “Even unto the most
high mighty works which Thou hast made.” Think not that man alone
belongeth to the grace of God. What was Angel before he was made? What
is Angel, if He forsake him who hath created? Therefore “Thy power and
Thy justice even unto the most high mighty works which Thou hast made.”

<span id="ii.LXXI-p102"></span>23. And man exalteth himself: and in
order that he may belong to the first captivity, he heareth the serpent
suggesting, “Taste, and ye shall be as Gods.” <span
id="fr_3149"></span>[3150](#fn_3149.md) Men as Gods? “O God, who is like
unto Thee?” Not any in the pit, not in Hell, not in earth, not in
Heaven, for all things Thou hast made. Why doth the work strive with the
Maker? “O God, who is like unto Thee?” But as for me, saith miserable
Adam, and Adam is <span id="fr_3150"></span>[3151](#fn_3150.md) every man,
while I perversely will to be like unto Thee, behold what I have become,
so that from captivity to Thee I cry out: I with whom it was well under
a good king, have been made captive under my seducer; and cry out to
Thee, because I have fallen from Thee. And whence have I fallen from
Thee? While I perversely seek to be like unto Thee.…

<span id="ii.LXXI-p105"></span>24. Ill straying, ill presuming, doomed
to die by withdrawing from the path <span
id="fr_3151"></span>[3152](#fn_3151.md) of righteousness: behold he
breaketh the commandment, he hath shaken off from his neck the yoke of
discipline, uplifted with high spirit he hath broken in sunder the reins
of guidance: where is he now? Truly captive he crieth, “O Lord, who is
like unto Thee?” I perversely willed to be like unto Thee, and I have
been made like unto a beast! Under Thy dominion, under Thy commandment,
I was indeed like: “But a man in honour set hath not perceived, he hath
been compared to beasts without sense, <span id="page_325">p. 325</span>
<span id="ii.LXXI-Page_325"></span>and hath been made like unto
them.” <span id="fr_3152"></span>[3153](#fn_3152.md) Now out of the
likeness of beasts cry though late and say, “O God, who is like unto
Thee?”

<span id="ii.LXXI-p108"></span>25. “How great troubles hast Thou shown
to me, many and evil!” ([Psa.
71.20](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#020.md)<span
id="ii.LXXI-p108.1"></span>). Deservedly, proud servant. For thou hast
willed perversely to be like thy God, who hadst been made after the
image of thy Lord. <span id="fr_3153"></span>[3154](#fn_3153.md) Wouldest
thou have it to be well with thee, when withdrawing from that good?
Truly God saith to thee, if thou withdrawest from Me, and it is well
with thee, I am not thy good. Again, if He is good, and in the highest
degree good, and of Himself to Himself good, and by no foreign good
thing good, and is Himself our chief good; by withdrawing from Him, what
wilt thou be but evil? Also if He is Himself our blessedness, what will
there be to one withdrawing from Him, except misery? Return thou then
after misery, and say, “O Lord, who is like unto Thee? How great
troubles hast Thou shown to me, many and evil!”

<span id="ii.LXXI-p110"></span>26. But this was discipline; admonition,
not desertion. Lastly, giving thanks, he saith what? “And being turned
Thou hast made me alive, and from the bottomless places of the earth
again Thou hast brought me back.” But when before? What is this “again”?
Thou hast fallen from a high place, O man, disobedient slave, O thou
proud against thy Lord, thou hast fallen. There hast come to pass in
thee, “every one that exalteth himself shall be humbled:” may there come
to pass in thee, “every one that humbleth himself shall be
exalted.” <span id="fr_3154"></span>[3155](#fn_3154.md) Return thou from
the deep. I return, he saith, I return, I acknowledge; “O God, who is
like unto Thee? How great troubles hast Thou shown to me, many and evil!
and being turned Thou hast made me alive, and from the bottomless places
of the earth again Thou hast brought me back.” “We perceive,” I hear.
Thou hast brought us back from the bottomless places of the earth, hast
brought us back from the depth and drowning of sin. But why “again”?
When had it already been done? Let us go on, if perchance the latter
parts of the Psalm itself do not explain to us the thing which here we
do not yet perceive, namely, why he hath said “again.” Therefore let us
hear: “How great troubles Thou hast shown to me, many and evil! And
being turned Thou hast made me alive, and from the bottomless places of
the earth again Thou hast brought me back.” What then? “Thou hast
multiplied Thy righteousness, and being turned Thou hast comforted me,
and from the bottomless places of the earth again Thou hast brought me
back” ([Psa. 71.21](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#021.md)<span
id="ii.LXXI-p111.2"></span>). Behold a second “again”! If we labour to
unravel this “again” when written once, who will be able to unravel it
when doubled? Now “again” itself is a redoubling, and once more there is
written “again.” May He be with us from whom is grace, may there be with
us the arm also which we are telling forth to every generation that is
to come: may He be with us Himself, and as with the key of His Cross
open to us the mystery that is locked up. For it was not to no purpose
that when He was crucified the veil of the temple was rent in the midst,
but to show that through His Passion the secret things of all mysteries
were opened. <span id="fr_3155"></span>[3156](#fn_3155.md) May He then
Himself be with men passing over unto Him, be the veil taken away: <span
id="fr_3156"></span>[3157](#fn_3156.md) may our Lord and Saviour Jesus
Christ tell us why such a voice of the Prophet hath been sent before,
“Thou hast shown to me troubles many and evil: and being turned Thou
hast made me alive, and from the bottomless places of the earth again
Thou hast brought me back.” Behold this is the first “again” which hath
been written. Let us see what this is, and we shall see why there is a
second “again.”

<span id="ii.LXXI-p114"></span>27. …Therein Christ died, wherein thou
art to die: and therein Christ rose again, wherein thou art to rise
again. By His example He taught thee what thou shouldest not fear, for
what thou shouldest hope. Thou didst fear death, He died: thou didst
despair of rising again, He rose again. But thou sayest to me, He rose
again, do I by any means rise again? But He rose again in that which for
thee He received of thee. Therefore thy nature in Him hath preceded
thee; and that which was taken of thee, hath gone up before thee:
therein therefore thou also hast ascended. Therefore He ascended first,
and we in Him: because that flesh is of the human race.…Behold one
“again.” Hear of its being fulfilled from the Apostle: “If then ye have
risen with Christ, the things which are above seek ye, where Christ is
sitting on the right hand of God; the things which are above mind ye,
not the things which are upon the earth.”  <span
id="fr_3157"></span>[3158](#fn_3157.md) He then hath gone before: already
we also have risen again, but still in hope. Hear the Apostle Paul
saying this same thing: “Even we ourselves groan in ourselves, looking
for the adoption, the redemption of our body.” What is it then that
Christ hath granted to thee? Hear that which followeth: “For by hope we
are saved: but hope which is seen is not hope. For that which a man
seeth, why doth he hope for? But if that which we see not we hope for,
through patience we wait for it.” We have been brought back therefore
again from the bottomless places in hope. Why again? Because already
Christ had gone before. But because we shall rise again in substance,
for now in hope we are living, now after faith we are <span
id="page_326">p. 326</span> <span id="ii.LXXI-Page_326"></span>walking;
we have been brought back from the bottomless places of the earth, by
believing in Him who before us hath risen again from the bottomless
place of the earth.…Thou hast heard one “again,” thou hast heard the
other: “again;” one “again” because of Christ going before; and the
other, yet however in hope, and a thing which remaineth to be in
substance. “Thou hast multiplied Thy righteousness,” <span
id="fr_3158"></span>[3159](#fn_3158.md) already in me believing, already in
those that first have risen again in hope.…“Thou hast multiplied Thy
righteousness, and being turned Thou hast comforted me:” and because of
the body to rise again at the end, even from the bottomless places of
the earth again Thou hast brought me back.

<span id="ii.LXXI-p117"></span>28. “For I will confess to Thee in the
vessels of a Psalm Thy truth” ([Psa.
71.22](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#022.md)<span
id="ii.LXXI-p117.1"></span>). The vessels of a Psalm are a Psaltery. But
what is a Psaltery? An instrument of wood and strings. <span
id="fr_3159"></span>[3160](#fn_3159.md) What doth it signify? There is some
difference between it and a harp:…there seemeth to be signified by the
Psaltery the Spirit, by the harp the flesh. And because he had spoken of
two bringings back of ours from the bottomless places of the earth, one
after the Spirit in hope, the other after the body in substance; hear
thou of these two: “For I will confess to Thee in the vessels of a Psalm
Thy truth.” This after the Spirit: concerning the body what? “I will
psalm to Thee on a harp, Holy One of Israel.”

<span id="ii.LXXI-p119"></span>29. Again hear this because of that same
“again” and “again.” “My lips shall exult when I shall psalm to Thee”
([Psa. 71.23](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#023.md)<span
id="ii.LXXI-p119.1"></span>). Because lips are wont to be spoken of both
belonging to the inner and to the outward man, it is uncertain in what
sense lips have been used: there followeth therefore, “And my soul which
Thou hast redeemed.” Therefore regarding the inward lips having been
saved in hope, brought back from the bottomless places of the earth in
faith and love, still however waiting for the redemption of our
body, <span id="fr_3160"></span>[3161](#fn_3160.md) we say what? Already he
hath said, “And my soul which Thou hast redeemed.” But lest thou
shouldest think the soul alone redeemed, wherein now thou hast heard one
“again,” “but still,” he saith; why still? “but still my tongue also:”
therefore now the tongue of the body: “all day long shall meditate of
Thy righteousness” ([Psa. 71.24](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#024.md)<span
id="ii.LXXI-p120.2"></span>): that is, in eternity without end. But when
shall this be? Hereafter at the end of the world, at the resurrection of
the body and the changing into the Angelic state. Whence is it proved
that this is spoken of the end, “but still my tongue also all day long
shall meditate of Thy righteousness”? “When they shall have been
confounded and shall have blushed, that seek evil things for me.” When
shall they be confounded, when shall they blush, save at the end of the
world? For in two ways they shall be confounded, either when they shall
believe in Christ, or when Christ shall have come. For so long as the
Church is here, so long as grain groaneth amid chaff, so long as wheat
groaneth amid tares, <span id="fr_3161"></span>[3162](#fn_3161.md) so long
as vessels of mercy groan amid vessels of wrath made for
dishonour, <span id="fr_3162"></span>[3163](#fn_3162.md) so long as lily
groaneth amid thorns, there will not be wanting enemies to say, “When
shall he die, and his name perish?” <span
id="fr_3163"></span>[3164](#fn_3163.md) “Behold there shall come the time
when Christians shall be ended and shall be no more: as they began at a
set time, so even unto a particular time they shall be.” But while they
are saying these things and without end <span
id="fr_3164"></span>[3165](#fn_3164.md) are dying, and while the Church is
continuing preaching the Arm of the Lord <span
id="fr_3165"></span>[3166](#fn_3165.md) to every generation that is to
come; there shall come Himself also at last in His glory, <span
id="fr_3166"></span>[3167](#fn_3166.md) there shall rise again all the
dead, each with his cause: there shall be severed good men to the right
hand, but evil men to the left, and they shall be confounded that did
insult, they shall blush that did mock: and so my tongue after
resurrection shall meditate of Thy righteousness, all day long of Thy
praise, “when they shall have been confounded and shall have blushed,
that seek evil things for me.”
