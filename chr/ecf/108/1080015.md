<span id="ii.XI-p1"></span> <span id="page_41">p. 41</span> <span
id="ii.XI-Page_41"></span>[Psalm
XI](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#000.md)<span id="ii.XI-p1.1"></span><span
class="c20"><span id="ii.XI-p1.2"></span>. <span
id="fr_408"></span>[409](#fn_408.md) </span>

<span id="ii.XI-p3"></span>*To the end, a psalm of David himself.* <span
id="fr_409"></span>[410](#fn_409.md)

<span id="ii.XI-p5"></span>1. This title does not require a fresh
consideration: for the meaning of, “to the end,” has already been
sufficiently handled. <span id="fr_410"></span>[411](#fn_410.md) Let us
then look to the text itself of the Psalm, which to me appears to be
sung against the heretics, <span id="fr_411"></span>[412](#fn_411.md) who,
by rehearsing and exaggerating the sins of many in the Church, as if
either all or the majority among themselves were righteous, strive to
turn and snatch us away from the breasts of the one True Mother Church:
affirming that Christ is with them, and warning us as if with piety and
earnestness, that by passing over to them we may go over to Christ, whom
they falsely declare they have. Now it is known that in prophecy Christ,
among the many names in which notice of Him is conveyed in allegory, is
also called a mountain. <span id="fr_412"></span>[413](#fn_412.md) We must
accordingly answer these people, and say, “I trust in the Lord: how say
ye to my soul, Remove into the mountains as a sparrow?” ([Psa.
11.1](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#001)<span id="ii.XI-p8.2"></span>.md). I
keep to one mountain wherein I trust, how say ye that I should pass over
to you, as if there were many Christs? Or if through pride you say that
you are mountains, I had indeed need to be a sparrow winged with the
powers and commandments of God: but these very things hinder my flying
to these mountains, and placing my trust in proud men. I have a house
where I may rest, in that I trust in the Lord. For even “the sparrow
hath found her a house,”  <span id="fr_413"></span>[414](#fn_413.md) and,
“The Lord hath become a refuge to the poor.” <span
id="fr_414"></span>[415](#fn_414.md) Let us say then with all confidence,
lest while we seek Christ among heretics we lose Him, “In the Lord I
trust: how say ye to my soul, Remove into the mountains as a sparrow?”

<span id="ii.XI-p11"></span>2. “For, lo, sinners have bent the bow, they
have prepared their arrows in the quiver, that they may in the obscure
moon shoot at the upright in heart” ([Psa.
11.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#002)<span id="ii.XI-p11.1"></span>.md).
These be the terrors of those who threaten us as touching sinners, that
we may pass over to them as the righteous. “Lo,” they say, “the sinners
have bent the bow:” the Scriptures, I suppose, by carnal interpretation
of which they emit envenomed sentences from them. “They have prepared
their arrows in the quiver:” the same words, that is, which they will
shoot out on the authority of Scripture, they have prepared in the
secret place of the heart. “That they may in the obscure moon <span
id="fr_415"></span>[416](#fn_415.md) shoot at the upright in heart:” that
when they see, from the Church’s light being obscured by the multitude
of the unlearned and the carnal, that they cannot be convicted, they may
corrupt good manners by evil communications. <span
id="fr_416"></span>[417](#fn_416.md) But against all these terrors we must
say, “In the Lord I trust.”

<span id="ii.XI-p14"></span>3. Now I remember that I promised to
consider in this Psalm with what suitableness the moon signifies the
Church. <span id="fr_417"></span>[418](#fn_417.md) There are two probable
opinions concerning the moon: but of these which is the true, I suppose
it either impossible or very difficult for a man to decide. For when we
ask whence the moon has her light, some say that it is her own, but that
of her globe half is bright, and half dark: and when she revolves in her
own orbit, that part wherein she is bright gradually turns towards the
earth, so as that it may be seen by us; and that therefore at first her
appearance is as if she were horned.…According to this opinion the moon
in allegory signifies the Church, because in its spiritual part the
Church is bright, but in its carnal part is dark: and sometimes the
spiritual part is seen by good works, but sometimes it lies hid in the
conscience, and is known to God alone, since in the body alone is it
seen by men.…But according to the other opinion also the moon is
understood to be the Church, because she has no light of her own, but is
lighted by the only-begotten Son of God, who in many places of holy
Scripture is allegorically called the Sun. <span
id="fr_418"></span>[419](#fn_418.md) Whom certain heretics <span
id="fr_419"></span>[420](#fn_419.md) being ignorant of, and not able to
discern Him, endeavour to turn away the minds of the simple to this
corporeal and visible sun, which is the common light of the flesh of men
and flies, and some they do pervert, who as long as they cannot behold
with the mind the inner light of truth, will not be content with the
simple Catholic faith; which is the only safety to babes, and by which
milk alone they can arrive in assured strength at the firm support of
more solid food. Whichever then of these two opinions be the true, the
moon in allegory is fitly understood as the Church. Or if in such
difficulties as these, troublesome rather than edifying, there be either
no satisfaction or no leisure to exercise the mind, or if the mind
itself be not capable of it, it is sufficient to regard the moon with
ordinary <span id="fr_420"></span>[421](#fn_420.md) eyes, and not to seek
out obscure causes, but with all men to perceive her increasings and
fulnesses and wanings; and if she wanes to the end that she may be
renewed, even to this rude multitude she sets forth the image of the
Church, in which the resurrection of the dead is believed.

<span id="ii.XI-p19"></span>4. Next we must enquire, what in this Psalm
is meant by “the obscure moon,” in which sinners have prepared to shoot
at the upright in <span id="page_42">p. 42</span> <span
id="ii.XI-Page_42"></span>heart? For not in one way only may the moon be
said to be obscure: for when her monthly course is finished, and when
her brightness is interrupted by a cloud, and when she is eclipsed at
the full, the moon may be called obscure. It may then be understood
first of the persecutors of the Martyrs, for that they wished in the
obscure moon to shoot at the upright in heart; whether it be yet in the
time of the Church’s youth, because she had not yet shone forth in
greatness on the earth, and conquered the darkness of heathen
superstitions; or by the tongues of blasphemers and such as defame the
Christian name, when the earth was as it were beclouded, the moon, that
is, the Church, could not be clearly seen; or when by the slaughter of
the Martyrs themselves and so great effusion of blood, as by that
eclipse and obscuration, wherein the moon seems to exhibit a bloody
face, the weak were deterred from the Christian name; in which terror
sinners shot out words crafty and sacrilegious to pervert even the
upright in heart. And secondly, it can be understood of these sinners,
whom the Church contains, because at that time, taking the opportunity
of this moon’s obscurity, they committed many crimes, which are now
tauntingly objected to us by the heretics, whereas their founders are
said to have been guilty of them. <span
id="fr_421"></span>[422](#fn_421.md) But howsoever that be which was done
in the obscure moon, now that the Catholic name is spread and celebrated
throughout the whole world, what concern of mine is it to be disturbed
by things unknown? For “in the Lord I trust;” nor do I listen to them
that say to my soul, “Remove into the mountains as a sparrow. For, lo,
sinners have bent the bow, that they may in the obscure moon shoot at
the upright in heart.” Or if the moon seem even  <span
id="fr_422"></span>[423](#fn_422.md) now obscure to them, because they
would make it uncertain which is the Catholic Church, and they strive to
convict her by the sins of those many carnal men whom she contains; what
concern is this to him, who says in truth, “In the Lord I trust”? By
which word every one shows that he is himself wheat, and endures the
chaff with patience unto the time of winnowing.

<span id="ii.XI-p22"></span>5. “In the Lord,” therefore, “I trust.” Let
them fear who trust in man, and cannot deny that they are of man’s
party, by whose grey hairs they swear; and when in conversation it is
demanded of them, of what communion they are, unless they say that they
are of his party, they cannot be recognised.…Or perhaps you will say
that it is written, “Ye shall know them by their works”? <span
id="fr_423"></span>[424](#fn_423.md) I see indeed marvellous works the
daily violences of the Circumcelliones, <span
id="fr_424"></span>[425](#fn_424.md) with the bishops and presbyters for
their leaders, flying about in every direction, and calling their
terrible clubs “Israels;” which men now living daily see and feel. But
for the times of Macarius, <span id="fr_425"></span>[426](#fn_425.md)
respecting which they raise an invidious cry, <span
id="fr_426"></span>[427](#fn_426.md) most men have not seen them, and no
one sees them now: and any Catholic who saw them could say, if he wished
to be a servant of God, “In the Lord I trust.”…

<span id="ii.XI-p27"></span>6. Let the Catholic soul then say, “In the
Lord I trust; how say ye to my soul, Remove into the mountains as a
sparrow? For, lo, the sinners have bent the bow, they have prepared
their arrows in the quiver, that they may in the obscure moon shoot at
the upright in heart:” and from them let her turn her speech to the Lord
and say, “For they have destroyed what Thou hast perfected” <span
id="fr_427"></span>[428](#fn_427.md) ([Psa.
11.3](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#003)<span id="ii.XI-p28.1"></span>.md).
And this let her say not against these only, but against all heretics.
For they have all, as far as in them lies, destroyed the praise which
God hath perfected out of the mouth of babes and sucklings, <span
id="fr_428"></span>[429](#fn_428.md) when they disturb the little ones with
vain and scrupulous questions, and suffer them not to be nourished with
the milk of faith. As if then it were said to this soul, why do they say
to you, “Remove into the mountains as a sparrow;” why do they frighten
you with sinners, who “have bent the bow, to shoot in the obscure moon
at the upright in heart”? She answers, Therefore it is they frighten me,
“because they have destroyed what Thou hast perfected.” Where but in
their conventicles, where they nourish not with milk, but kill with
poison the babes and ignorant of the interior light. “But what hath the
Just done?” <span id="fr_429"></span>[430](#fn_429.md) If Macarius, if
Cæcilianus, offend you, what hath Christ done to you, who said, “My
peace I give unto you, My peace I leave with you;” <span
id="fr_430"></span>[431](#fn_430.md) which ye with your abominable
dissensions have violated? What hath Christ done to you? who with such
exceeding patience endured His betrayer, as to give to him, as to the
other Apostles, the first Eucharist consecrated <span
id="fr_431"></span>[432](#fn_431.md) with His own hands, and blessed with
His own mouth. <span id="fr_432"></span>[433](#fn_432.md) What hath Christ
done to you? who sent this same betrayer, whom He called a devil, <span
id="fr_433"></span>[434](#fn_433.md) who before betraying the Lord could
not show good faith even to the Lord’s purse, <span
id="fr_434"></span>[435](#fn_434.md) with the other disciples to preach the
kingdom of heaven; <span id="fr_435"></span>[436](#fn_435.md) that He might
show that the gifts of God come to those that with <span id="page_43">p.
43</span> <span id="ii.XI-Page_43"></span>faith receive them, though he,
through whom they receive them, be such as Judas was.

<span id="ii.XI-p37"></span>7. “The Lord is in His holy temple” ([Psa.
11.4](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#004)<span id="ii.XI-p37.1"></span>.md),
yea in such wise as the Apostle saith, “For the temple of God is holy,
which” temple “ye are.” <span id="fr_436"></span>[437](#fn_436.md) “Now if
any man shall violate the temple of God, him shall God destroy.” He
violateth the temple of God, who violateth unity: for he “holdeth not
the head, from which the whole body fitly joined together and compacted
by that which every joint supplieth <span
id="fr_437"></span>[438](#fn_437.md) according to the working after the
measure of every part maketh increase of the body to the edifying of
itself in love.” <span id="fr_438"></span>[439](#fn_438.md) The Lord is in
this His holy temple; which consisteth of His many members, fulfilling
each his own separate duties, by love built up into one building. Which
temple he violateth, who for the sake of his own pre-eminence separateth
himself from the Catholic society. “The Lord is in His holy temple; the
Lord, His seat is in heaven.” If you take heaven to be the just man, as
you take the earth to be the sinner, to whom it was said, “Earth thou
art, and unto earth shalt thou go;” <span
id="fr_439"></span>[440](#fn_439.md) the words, “The Lord is in His holy
temple” you will understand to be repeated, whilst it is said, “The
Lord, His seat is in heaven.”

<span id="ii.XI-p42"></span>8. “His eyes look upon the poor.” <span
id="fr_440"></span>[441](#fn_440.md) His to Whom the poor man hath been
left, and Who hath been made a refuge to the poor. <span
id="fr_441"></span>[442](#fn_441.md) And therefore all the seditions and
tumults within these nets, <span id="fr_442"></span>[443](#fn_442.md) until
they be drawn to shore, concerning which heretics upbraid us to their
own ruin and our correction, are caused by those men, who will not be
Christ’s poor. But do they turn away God’s eyes from such as would be
so? “For His eyes look upon the poor.” Is it to be feared lest, in the
crowd of the rich, He may not be able to see the few poor, whom He
brings up in safe keeping in the bosom of the Catholic Church? “His
eyelids question the sons of men.” Here by that rule I would wish to
take “the sons of men” <span id="fr_443"></span>[444](#fn_443.md) of those
that from old men have been regenerated by faith. For these, by certain
obscure passages of Scripture, as it were the closed eyes of God, are
exercised that they may seek: and again, by certain clear passages, as
it were the open eyes of God, are enlightened that they may rejoice. And
this frequent closing and opening in the holy Books are as it were the
eyelids of God; which question, that is, which try the “sons of men;”
who are neither wearied with the obscurity of the matter, but exercised;
nor puffed up by knowledge, but confirmed.

<span id="ii.XI-p47"></span>9. “The Lord questioneth the righteous and
ungodly” ([Psa. 11.5](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#005.md)<span
id="ii.XI-p47.1"></span>). Why then do we fear lest the ungodly should
be any hurt to us, if so be they do with insincere heart share the
sacraments with us, seeing that He “questioneth the righteous and the
ungodly.” “But whoso loveth iniquity, hateth his own soul:” that is, not
him who believeth God, and putteth not his hope in man, but only his own
soul doth the lover of iniquity hurt.

<span id="ii.XI-p48"></span>10. “He shall rain snares upon the sinners”
([Psa. 11.6](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#006.md)<span
id="ii.XI-p48.1"></span>). If by clouds are understood prophets
generally, whether good or bad, who are also called false prophets:
false prophets are so ordered by the Lord God, that by them He may rain
snares upon sinners. <span id="fr_444"></span>[445](#fn_444.md) For no one,
but the sinner, falls into a following of them, whether by way of
preparation for the last punishment, if he shall choose to persevere in
sin; or to dissuade from pride, if in time he shall come to seek God
with a more sincere intent. But if by clouds are understood good and
true prophets only; by these too it is clear that God raineth snares
upon sinners, although by them He watereth also the godly unto
fruitfulness. “To some,” saith the Apostle, “we are the savour of life
unto life; to some the savour of death unto death.” <span
id="fr_445"></span>[446](#fn_445.md) For not prophets only, but all who
with the word of God water souls, may be called clouds. Who when they
are understood amiss, God raineth snares upon sinners; but when they are
understood aright, He maketh the hearts of the godly and believing
fruitful. As, for instance, the passage, “and they two shall be in one
flesh,” <span id="fr_446"></span>[447](#fn_446.md) if one interpret it with
an eye to lust, He raineth a snare upon the sinner. But if you
understand it, as he who says, “But I speak concerning Christ and the
Church,” <span id="fr_447"></span>[448](#fn_447.md) He raineth a shower on
the fertile soil. Now both are effected by the same cloud, that is, holy
Scripture. Again the Lord says, “Not that which goeth into your mouth
defileth you, but that which cometh out.” <span
id="fr_448"></span>[449](#fn_448.md) The sinner hears this, and makes ready
his palate for gluttony: the righteous hears it, and is guarded against
the superstitious distinction in meats. Here then also out of the same
cloud of Scripture, according to the several desert of each, upon the
sinner the rain of snares, upon the righteous the rain of fruitfulness,
is poured.

<span id="ii.XI-p54"></span>11. “Fire and brimstone and the blast of the
tempest is the portion of their cup.” This is their punishment and end,
by whom the name of God is blasphemed; that first they should be wasted
by the fire of their own lusts, then by the ill savour of their evil
deeds cast off from the company of the blessed, at last carried away
<span id="page_44">p. 44</span> <span id="ii.XI-Page_44"></span>and
overwhelmed suffer penalties unspeakable. For this is the portion of
their cup: as of the righteous, “Thy cup inebriating how excellent is
it! for they shall be inebriated with the richness of Thine
house.” <span id="fr_449"></span>[450](#fn_449.md) Now I suppose a cup is
mentioned for this reason, that we should not suppose that anything is
done by God’s providence, even in the very punishments of sinners,
beyond moderation and measure. And therefore as if he were giving a
reason why this should be, he added, “For the Lord is righteous, and
hath loved righteousnesses” ([Psa.
11.7](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#007)<span id="ii.XI-p55.2"></span>.md).
The plural not without meaning, but only because he speaks of men, is as
that righteousnesses be understood to be used for righteous men. For in
many righteous men there seem, so to say, to be righteousnesses, whereas
there is one only righteousness of God whereof they all participate.
Like as when one face looks upon many mirrors, what in it is one only,
is by those many mirrors reflected manifoldly. Wherefore he recurs to
the singular, saying, “His face hath seen equity.” Perhaps, “His face
hath seen equity,” is as if it were said, Equity hath been seen in His
face, that is, in knowledge of Him. For God’s face is the power by which
He is made known to them that are worthy. Or at least, “His face hath
seen equity,” because He doth not allow Himself to be known by the evil,
but by the good; and this is equity.

<span id="ii.XI-p56"></span>12. But if any one would understand the moon
of the synagogue, let him refer the Psalm to the Lord’s passion, and of
the Jews say, “For they have destroyed what Thou hast perfected;” <span
id="fr_450"></span>[451](#fn_450.md) and of the Lord Himself, “But what
hath the Just done?” whom they accused as the destroyer of the Law:
whose precepts, by their corrupt living, and by despising them, and by
setting up their own, they had destroyed, so that the Lord Himself may
speak as Man, as He is wont, saying, “In the Lord I trust; how say ye to
my soul, Remove into the mountains as a sparrow?” <span
id="fr_451"></span>[452](#fn_451.md) by reason, that is, of the fear of
those who desire to apprehend and crucify Him. Since the interpretation
is not unreasonable of sinners wishing to “shoot at the upright in
heart,” <span id="fr_452"></span>[453](#fn_452.md) that is, those who
believed in Christ, “in the obscure moon,” that is, the Synagogue filled
with sinners. To this too the words, “The Lord is in His holy temple;
the Lord, His seat is in heaven,” <span
id="fr_453"></span>[454](#fn_453.md) are suitable; that is, the Word in
Man, or the very Son of Man who is in heaven. <span
id="fr_454"></span>[455](#fn_454.md) “His eyes look upon the poor;” either
on to Him whom He assumed as God, or for whom He suffered as Man. “His
eyelids question the sons of men.” The closing and opening of the eyes,
which is probably meant by the word eyelids, we may take to be His death
and resurrection, whereby He tried the sons of men His disciples,
terrified at His passion, and gladdened by the resurrection. “The Lord
questioneth the righteous and ungodly,” <span
id="fr_455"></span>[456](#fn_455.md) even now from out of Heaven governing
the Church. “But whoso loveth iniquity, hateth his own soul.” Why it is
so, what follows teaches us. For “He shall rain snares upon the
sinners:” <span id="fr_456"></span>[457](#fn_456.md) which is to be taken
according to the exposition above given, and so on with all the rest to
the end of the Psalm.
