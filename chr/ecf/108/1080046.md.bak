</span>

<span id="ii.XXXIX-p3"></span>1. The title of this Psalm, which we have
just chanted and proposed to discuss, is, “On the end, for Idithun, a
Psalm for David himself.” Here then we must look for, and must attend
to, the words of a certain person who is called Idithun; and if each one
of ourselves may be Idithun, in that which he sings he recognises
himself, and hears himself speak. For thou mayest see who was called
Idithun, according to the ancient descent of man; let us, however,
understand what this name is translated, and seek to comprehend the
Truth in the translation of the word. According therefore to what we
have been able to discover by enquiry in those names which have been
translated from the Hebrew tongue into the Latin, by those who study the
sacred writings, Idithun being translated is “over-leaping them.” Who
then is this person “over-leaping them”? or who those whom he hath
“over-leaped”?…For there are some persons, yet clinging to the earth,
yet bowed down to the ground, yet setting their hearts on what is below,
yet placing their hopes in things that pass away, whom he who is called
“over-leaping them” hath “over-leaped.”

<span id="ii.XXXIX-p4"></span>2. You know that some of the Psalms are
entitled, “Songs of Degrees;” and in the Greek it is obvious enough what
the word <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.XXXIX-p4.1"></span>‡</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.XXXIX-p4.2"></span>ναβαθμῶν</span> means. For <span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.XXXIX-p4.3"></span>‡</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.XXXIX-p4.4"></span>ναβαθμοὶ</span> are
degrees (or steps) of them that ascend, not of them that descend. The
Latin, not being able to express it strictly, expresses it by the
general term; and in that it called them “steps,” left it undetermined,
whether they were “steps” of persons ascending or descending. But
because there is no “speech or language where their voices are not heard
among them,” <span id="fr_1018"></span>[1019](#fn_1018.md) the earlier
language explains the one which comes after it: and what was ambiguous
in one is made certain in another. Just then as there the singer is some
one who is “ascending,” so here is it some one who is
“over-leaping.”…Let this Idithun come still to us, let him “over-leap”
those whose delight is in things below, and take delight in these
things, and let him rejoice in the Word of the Lord; in the delight of
the law of the Most High.…

<span id="ii.XXXIX-p6"></span>3. “I said, I will take heed to my ways,
that I sin not with my tongue” ([Psa.
39.1](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#001.md)<span
id="ii.XXXIX-p6.1"></span>).…For it is not without reason that the
tongue is set in a moist place, but because it is so prone to
slip. <span id="fr_1019"></span>[1020](#fn_1019.md) Perceiving therefore
how hard it was for a man to be under the necessity of speaking, and not
to say something that he will wish unsaid, and filled with disgust at
these sins, he seeks to avoid the like. To this difficulty is he exposed
who is seeking to “leap beyond.”…Although I have “leaped beyond” the
pleasures of earth, although the fleeting <span
id="fr_1020"></span>[1021](#fn_1020.md) passions for things temporal
ensnare me not, though now I despise these things below, and am rising
up to better things than these, yet in these very better things the
satisfaction of knowledge in the sight of God is enough for me. Of what
use is it for me to speak what is to be laid hold of, and to give a
handle to cavillers? Therefore, “I said, I will take heed to my ways,
that I sin not with my tongue. I keep my mouth with a bridle.” Wherefore
is this? Is it on account of the religious, the thoughtful, the
faithful, the holy ones? God forbid! These persons hear in such a
manner, as to praise what they approve; but as for what they disapprove,
perhaps, among much that they praise they rather excuse than cavil at
it; on account of what persons then dost thou “take heed to thy ways,”
and place a guard on thy lips “that thou mayest not sin with thy
tongue”? Hear: it is, “While the wicked standeth over against me.” It is
not “by me” that he takes up his station, but “against me.” Why?…Even
the Lord Himself says, “I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye
cannot bear them now.” <span id="fr_1021"></span>[1022](#fn_1021.md) And
the Apostle, “I could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto
carnal.” <span id="fr_1022"></span>[1023](#fn_1022.md) Yet not as to
persons to be despaired of, but as to those who still required to be
nourished. For he goes on to say, “As babes in Christ, I have fed you
with milk, and not with meat; for hitherto ye were not able.” Well, tell
it unto us even now. “Neither yet now are ye able.” <span
id="fr_1023"></span>[1024](#fn_1023.md) Be not therefore impatient to hear
that which as yet thou art not capable of; but grow that thou mayest be
“able to bear it.” It is thus we address the little one, who yet
requires to be fed with kindly milk <span
id="fr_1024"></span>[1025](#fn_1024.md) in the bosom of Mother Church, and
to be rendered meet for the “strong meat” of the Lord’s Table. But what
can I say even of that kind to the sinner, who “taketh his stand against
me,” who either thinks or pretends himself capable of what he “cannot
bear;” so that when I say anything unto him, and he has failed to
comprehend it, he should not suppose that it was not he that had failed
to comprehend, but I who had broken down. Therefore because of this
sinner, who “taketh up his stand against me, I keep my mouth as it were
with a bridle.”

<span id="ii.XXXIX-p13"></span>4. “I became deaf, and was humbled, I
held my peace from good” ([Psa.
39.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#002.md)<span
id="ii.XXXIX-p13.1"></span>). For this person, who is “leaping beyond,”
suffers some difficulty in a certain stage to which he hath already
attained; and he desires to advance beyond, even from thence, to avoid
this difficulty. I was afraid of committing a sin; so that I spoke not;
that I imposed on myself the necessity of silence: for I had spoken
thus, “I will take heed <span id="page_113">p. 113</span> <span
id="ii.XXXIX-Page_113"></span>to my ways, that I may not sin with my
tongue.” Whilst I was too much afraid of saying anything wrong, I kept
silence from all that is good. For whence could I say good things,
except that I heard them? “It is Thou that shalt make me to hear of joy
and gladness.” <span id="fr_1025"></span>[1026](#fn_1025.md) And the
“friend of the bridegroom standeth and heareth Him, and rejoiceth on
account of the bridegroom’s voice,” <span
id="fr_1026"></span>[1027](#fn_1026.md) not his own. That he may speak true
things, he hears what he is to say. For it is he that “speaketh a lie,”
that “speaketh of his own.” <span id="fr_1027"></span>[1028](#fn_1027.md)
…When therefore I had “put a bridle,” as it were, “on my lips;” and
constrained myself to silence, because I saw that everywhere speech was
dangerous, then, says he, that came to pass upon me, which I did not
wish, “I became deaf, and was humbled;” not humbled myself, but was
humbled; “and I held my peace even from good.” Whilst afraid of saying
any evil, I began to refrain from speaking what is good: and I condemned
my determination; for “I was holding my peace even from what is good.”

<span id="ii.XXXIX-p17"></span>“And my sorrow was stirred up again”
([Psa. 39.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#002.md)<span
id="ii.XXXIX-p17.1"></span>). Inasmuch as I had found in silence a kind
of respite from a certain “sorrow,” that had been inflicted upon me by
those who cavilled at my words, and found fault with me: and that sorrow
that was caused by the cavillers, had ceased indeed; but when “I held my
peace even from good, my sorrow was stirred up again.” I began to be
more grieved at having refrained from saying what I ought to have said,
than I had before been grieved by having said what I ought not. “And my
sorrow was stirred up again.” <span id="fr_1028"></span>[1029](#fn_1028.md)

<span id="ii.XXXIX-p19"></span>5. “And while I was musing, the fire
burned” ([Psa. 39.3](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#003.md)<span
id="ii.XXXIX-p19.1"></span>).…I reflected on the words of my Lord, “Thou
wicked and slothful servant, thou oughtest to have put My money to the
exchangers, and I at My coming should receive it again with
usury.” <span id="fr_1029"></span>[1030](#fn_1029.md) And that which
follows may God avert from those who are His stewards! Bind him hand and
foot, and let him be cast into outer darkness; <span
id="fr_1030"></span>[1031](#fn_1030.md) the servant, who was not a waster
of his master’s goods, so as to destroy them, but was slothful in laying
them out to improve them. What ought they to expect, who have wasted
them in luxury, if they are condemned who through slothfulness have kept
them? “As I was musing, the fire burned.” And as he was in this state of
wavering suspense, between speaking and holding his peace, between those
who are prepared to cavil and those who are anxious to be instructed,…in
this state of suspense, he prays for a better place, a place different
from this his present stewardship, in which man is in such difficulty
and in such danger, and sighing after a certain “end,” when he was not
to be subject to these things, when the Lord is to say to the faithful
dispenser, “Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord,” <span
id="fr_1031"></span>[1032](#fn_1031.md) he says, “Then spake I with my
tongue.” In this fluctuation, in the midst of these dangers and these
difficulties, because, that in consequence of the abundance of offences
“the love of many is waxing cold,” <span
id="fr_1032"></span>[1033](#fn_1032.md) although the law of the Lord
inspires delight, in this fluctuation then, (I say), “then spake I with
my tongue.” To whom? not to the hearer whom I would fain instruct; but
to Him who heareth and taketh heed also, by whom I would fain be
instructed myself. “I spake with my tongue” to Him, from whom I inwardly
hear whatever I hear that is good or true.—What saidst thou?

<span id="ii.XXXIX-p24"></span>“Lord, make me to know mine end” ([Psa.
39.4](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#004.md)<span
id="ii.XXXIX-p24.1"></span>). For some things I have passed by already;
and I have arrived at a certain point, and that to which I have arrived
is better than that from which I have advanced to this; but yet there
remains a point, which has to be left behind. For we are not to remain
here, where there are trials, offences, where we have to bear with
persons who listen to us and cavil at us. “Make me to know mine end;”
the end, from which I am still removed, not the course which is already
before me.

<span id="ii.XXXIX-p25"></span>6. The “end” he speaks of, is that which
the Apostle fixed his eye upon, in his course; and made confession of
his own infirmity, perceiving in himself a different state of things
from that which he looked for elsewhere. For he says, “Not that I have
already attained, or am already perfect. Brethren, I count not myself to
have apprehended.” <span id="fr_1033"></span>[1034](#fn_1033.md) And that
you might not say, “If the Apostle hath not apprehended, have I
apprehended? If the Apostle is not perfect, am I perfect?”…

<span id="ii.XXXIX-p27"></span>7. “And the number of my days, what it
is.” I ask of “the number of my days, what it is.” I can speak of
“number” without number, and understand “number without number,” in the
same sense as “years without years” may be spoken of. For where there
are years, there is a sort of “number” at all events, also. But yet,
“Thou art the same, and Thy years shall not fail.” <span
id="fr_1034"></span>[1035](#fn_1034.md) “Make me to know the number of my
days;” but “to know what it is.” What then? that number in which thou
art, think you that it “is” not? Assuredly, if I weigh the matter well,
it has no being; if I linger behind, it has a sort of being; if I rise
above it, it has none. If, shaking off the trammels of these things, I
contemplate things above, if I compare things that pass away with those
that endure, I see <span id="page_114">p. 114</span> <span
id="ii.XXXIX-Page_114"></span>what has a true being, and what rather
seems to be, than really is. Should I say that these days of mine “are;”
and shall I rashly apply this word so full of meaning to this course of
things passing away? To such a degree have I my own self almost ceased
to “be, failing” as I am in my weakness, that He escaped from my memory,
who said, “<span class="c13"><span id="ii.XXXIX-p28.2"></span>I AM HE
THAT IS</span>.” <span id="fr_1035"></span>[1036](#fn_1035.md) Hath then
any number of days any existence? In truth it hath, and it is “number
without end.”…Everything is swept on by a series of moments, fleeting
by, one after the other; there is a torrent of existences ever flowing
on and on; a “torrent,” <span id="fr_1036"></span>[1037](#fn_1036.md) of
which He “drank in the way,” who hath now “lift up His Head.” These days
then have no true being; they are gone almost before they arrive; and
when they are come, they cannot continue; they press upon one another,
they follow the one the other, and cannot check themselves in their
course. Of the past nothing is called back again; what is yet to be, is
expected as something to pass away again: it is not as yet possessed,
whilst as yet it is not arrived; it cannot be kept when once it has
arrived. He asks then concerning “the number of his days, which is;” not
that which is “not:” and (which confounds me by a still greater and more
perplexing difficulty) at once “is,” and “is not.” We can neither say
that “is,” which does not continue; nor that it “is not,” when it has
come and is passing. It is that absolute “<span class="c21"><span
id="ii.XXXIX-p30.2"></span>IS</span>,” that true “<span
class="c21"><span id="ii.XXXIX-p30.3"></span>IS</span>,” that “<span
class="c21"><span id="ii.XXXIX-p30.4"></span>IS</span>” in the true
sense of the word, that I long for; that “<span class="c21"><span
id="ii.XXXIX-p30.5"></span>IS</span>;” which “is” in that “Jerusalem”
which is “the Bride” of my Lord; <span
id="fr_1037"></span>[1038](#fn_1037.md) where there will not be death,
there will not be failing; there will be a day that passeth not away,
but continueth: which has neither a yesterday to precede it, nor a
to-morrow pressing close upon it. <span
id="fr_1038"></span>[1039](#fn_1038.md) This “number of my days, which is,”
this (I say), “make Thou me to know.”

<span id="ii.XXXIX-p33"></span>8. “That I may know what is wanting to
me.” For while I am struggling here, “this” is wanting unto me: and so
long as it is wanting unto me, I do not call myself perfect. So long as
I have not received it, I say, “not that I have already attained, either
am already perfect; but I am pressing towards the prize of God’s high
calling.” <span id="fr_1039"></span>[1040](#fn_1039.md) This let me receive
as the prize of my running the race! There will be a certain
resting-place, to terminate my course; and in that resting-place there
will be a Country, and no pilgrimage, no dissension, no temptation. Make
me then to know “this number of my days, which is, that I may know what
is wanting unto me;” because I am not there yet; lest I should be made
proud of what I already am, that “I may be found in Him, not having mine
own righteousness.”  <span id="fr_1040"></span>[1041](#fn_1040.md) …

<span id="ii.XXXIX-p36"></span>9. “Behold, thou hast made my days
old” <span id="fr_1041"></span>[1042](#fn_1041.md) ([Psa.
39.5](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#005.md)<span
id="ii.XXXIX-p37.1"></span>). For these days are “waxing old.” I long
for new days “that never shall wax old,” that I may say, “Old things
have passed away; behold, things are become new.” <span
id="fr_1042"></span>[1043](#fn_1042.md) Already new in hope; then in
reality. For though, in hope and in faith, made new already, how much do
we even now do after our old nature! For we are not so completely
“clothed upon” with Christ, as not to bear about with us anything
derived from Adam. Observe that Adam is “waxing old” within us, and
Christ is being “renewed” in us. “Though our outward man is perishing,
yet is our inward man being renewed day by day.” <span
id="fr_1043"></span>[1044](#fn_1043.md) Therefore, while we fix our
thoughts on sin, on mortality, on time, that is hastening by, on sorrow,
and toil, and labour, on stages of life following each other in
succession, and continuing not, passing on insensibly from infancy even
to old age; whilst, I say, we fix our eyes on these things, let us see
here “the old man,” the “day that is waxing old;” the Song that is out
of date; the Old Testament; <span id="fr_1044"></span>[1045](#fn_1044.md)
when however we turn to the inner man, to those things that are to be
renewed in place of these which are to be changed, let us find the “new
man,” the “new day,” the “new song,” the “New Testament;” and that
“newness,” let us so love, as to have no fears of its “waxing old.”…This
man, therefore, who is hasting forward to those things which are new,
and “reaching forward to those things which are before,” says, “Lord,
make me to know mine end, and the number of my days, which really is,
that I may know what is wanting unto me.” See he still drags with him
Adam; and even so he is hasting unto Christ. “Behold,” saith he, “thou
hast made my days old.” It is those days that are derived from Adam,
those days, I say, that thou hast made old. They are waxing old day by
day: and so waxing old, as to be at some day or other consumed also.
“And my substance is as nothing before Thee.” <span
id="fr_1045"></span>[1046](#fn_1045.md) “Before Thee, O Lord, my substance
is as nothing.” “Before Thee;” who seest this; and I too, when I see it,
see it only when “before Thee.”

<span id="ii.XXXIX-p42"></span>When “before men” I see it not. For what
shall I say? What words shall I use to show, that which I now am is
nothing in comparison of That which truly “<span class="c21"><span
id="ii.XXXIX-p42.1"></span>IS</span>”? But it is within that it is
said; <span id="fr_1046"></span>[1047](#fn_1046.md) it is within that it is
felt, so far as it is felt. “Before Thee, O Lord,” where Thine eyes are;
and not where the eyes of men are. And where Thine eyes are, what is the
state of things? “That which I am is as nothing.”

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span> <span id="ii.XXXIX-Page_115"></span>

<span id="ii.XXXIX-p44"></span>10. “But, verily, every man living is
altogether vanity.” “But, verily.” For what was he saying above? Behold,
I have already “leaped beyond” all mortal things, and despised things
below, have trampled under foot the things of earth, have soared upwards
to the delights of the law of the Lord, I have been afloat in the
dispensation of the Lord, <span id="fr_1047"></span>[1048](#fn_1047.md)
have yearned for that “End” which Itself is to know no end, have yearned
for the number of my days that truly “is,” because the number of days
like these hath no real being. Behold, I am already such a one as this;
I have already overleaped so much; I am longing for those things which
abide. “But verily,” in the state in which I am here, so long as I am
here, so long as I am in this world, so long as I bear mortal flesh, so
long as the life of man on earth is a trial, so long as I sigh among
causes of offence, as long as while I “stand” I am in “fear lest I
fall,” <span id="fr_1048"></span>[1049](#fn_1048.md) as long as both my
good and my ill hangs in uncertainty, “every man living is altogether
vanity.”…

<span id="ii.XXXIX-p47"></span>11. “Albeit man walketh in the
Image” <span id="fr_1049"></span>[1050](#fn_1049.md) ([Psa.
39.6](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#006.md)<span
id="ii.XXXIX-p48.1"></span>). In what “Image,” save that of Him who
said, “Let Us make man in Our Image, after Our Likeness.” <span
id="fr_1050"></span>[1051](#fn_1050.md) “Albeit man walks in the Image.”
For the reason he says “albeit,” is, that this is some great thing. And
this “albeit” is followed by “nevertheless,” that the “albeit” which you
have already heard, should relate to what is beyond the sun; but this
“nevertheless,” which is to follow, to what is “under the sun,” and that
the one should relate to the Truth, the other to “vanity.” “Albeit,”
then, “that man walketh in the Image, nevertheless he is disquieted in
vain.” Hear the cause of his “disquieting,” and see if it be not a vain
one; that thou mayest trample it under foot, that thou mayest “leap
beyond it,” and mayest dwell on high, where that “vanity” is not. What
“vanity” is that? “He heapeth up riches, and knoweth not for whom he may
be gathering them together.” O infatuated vanity! “Blessed is the man
that maketh the Lord his trust, and hath not respected vanities, nor
lying deceits.” <span id="fr_1051"></span>[1052](#fn_1051.md) To you
indeed, O covetous man, to you I seem to be out of my senses, these
words appear to you to be “old wives’ tales.” For you, a man of great
judgment, and of great prudence, to be sure, are daily devising methods
of acquiring money, by traffic, by agriculture, by eloquence perhaps, by
making yourself learned in the law, by warfare, perhaps you even add
that of usury. Like a shrewd man as you are, you leave nothing untried,
whereby you may pile coin on coin; and may store it up <span
id="fr_1052"></span>[1053](#fn_1052.md) more carefully in a place of
secrecy. You plunder others; you guard against the plunderer; you are
afraid lest you should yourself suffer the wrong, that you yourself do;
and even what you do suffer, does not correct you.…Examine your own
heart, and that prudence of yours, which leads you to deride me, to
think me out of my senses for saying these things: and tell me now, “You
are heaping up treasures; for whom are you gathering them together?” I
see what you would tell me; as if what you would say had not occurred to
the person described here; you will say, I am keeping them for my
children? This is the voice of parental affection; the excuse of
injustice. “I am keeping them” (you say) “for my children.” So then you
are keeping them for your children, are you? Did not Idithun then know
this? Assuredly he did; but he reckoned it one of the things of the “old
days,” that have waxed old, and therefore he despised it: because he was
hastening on to the new “days.”…

<span id="ii.XXXIX-p52"></span>12. For He, “by whom all things were
made,” <span id="fr_1053"></span>[1054](#fn_1053.md) hath built “mansions”
for all of us: thither He would have that which we have go before us;
that we may not lose it <span id="fr_1054"></span>[1055](#fn_1054.md) on
earth. When, however, you have kept them on earth, tell me for whom you
are to “gather them together”? You have children: add one more to their
number; and give something to Christ also. “He is disquieted in vain.”

<span id="ii.XXXIX-p55"></span>13. “And now” ([Psa.
39.7](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#007.md)<span
id="ii.XXXIX-p55.1"></span>). “And now,” saith this Idithun,—looking
back on a certain “vain” show, and looking up to a certain Truth,
standing midway where he has something beyond him, and something also
behind him, having below him the place from which he took his spring,
having above him that toward which he has stretched forth;—“And now,”
when I have “over-leaped” some things, when I have trampled many things
under foot, when I am no longer captivated by things temporal; even now,
I am not perfect, “I have not yet apprehended.” <span
id="fr_1055"></span>[1056](#fn_1055.md) “For it is by hope that we are
saved; but hope that is seen is not hope; for what a man seeth, why doth
he yet hope for? But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with
patience wait for it.” <span id="fr_1056"></span>[1057](#fn_1056.md)
Therefore he says: “And now what wait I for? Is it not for the
Lord?” <span id="fr_1057"></span>[1058](#fn_1057.md) He is my expectation,
who hath given <span id="page_116">p. 116</span> <span
id="ii.XXXIX-Page_116"></span>me all those things, that I might despise
them. He will give unto me Himself also, even He who is above all, and
“by whom all things were made,” <span
id="fr_1058"></span>[1059](#fn_1058.md) and by whom I was made amongst all;
even He, the Lord, is my Expectation! You see Idithun, brethren, you see
in what way he waiteth for Him! Let no man therefore call himself
perfect here; he deceives and imposes upon himself; he is beguiling
himself, he cannot have perfection here, and what avails it that he
should lose humility?…

<span id="ii.XXXIX-p60"></span>“And my substance is ever before Thee.”
Already advancing, already tending towards Him, and to some extent
already beginning to “be,” still (he says <span
id="fr_1059"></span>[1060](#fn_1059) .md) “my substance is ever before
Thee.” Now that other substance is also before men. You have gold,
silver, slaves, estates, trees, cattle, servants. These things are
visible even to men. There is a certain “substance that is ever before
Thee.”

<span id="ii.XXXIX-p62"></span>14. “Deliver me from all my
transgressions” ([Psa. 39.8](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#008.md)<span
id="ii.XXXIX-p62.1"></span>). I have “over-leaped” a great deal of
ground, a very great deal of ground already; but, “If we say that we
have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the Truth is not in us.” <span
id="fr_1060"></span>[1061](#fn_1060.md) I have “over-leaped” a great deal:
but still do I “beat my breast,” and say, “Forgive us our debts, as we
forgive our debtors.” <span id="fr_1061"></span>[1062](#fn_1061.md) Thou
therefore art “my expectation!” my “End.” For “Christ is the end of the
Law unto righteousness, unto every man that believeth.” <span
id="fr_1062"></span>[1063](#fn_1062.md) From all mine offences: not only
from those, that I may not relapse into those which I have already
“over-leaped;” but from all, without exception, of those on account of
which I now beat my breast, and say, “Forgive us our debts.” “Deliver me
from all mine offences:” me being thus minded, and holding fast what the
Apostle said, “As many of us as be perfect, let us be thus
minded.” <span id="fr_1063"></span>[1064](#fn_1063.md) For at the time that
he said that he was not “already perfect,” he then immediately goes on
and says, “As many of us as be perfect, let us be thus minded.”…Art thou
then, O Apostle, not perfect, and are we perfect? But hath it escaped
you, that he did just now call himself “perfect”? For he does not say,
“As many of you as are perfect, be *ye* thus minded;” but “As many of
*us* as be perfect, let us be thus minded;” after having said a little
before, “Not that I have already attained; either am already perfect.”
In no other way then can you be perfect in this life, than by knowing
that you cannot be perfect in this life. This then will be your
perfection, so to have “over-leaped” some things, as to have still some
point to which you are hastening on: so as to have something remaining,
to which you will have to leap on, when everything else has been passed
by. It is such faith as this that is secure; for whoever thinks that he
has already attained, is “exalting himself,” so as to be “abased”
hereafter. <span id="fr_1064"></span>[1065](#fn_1064.md) …

<span id="ii.XXXIX-p68"></span>15. “Thou hast made me the reproach of
the foolish.” Thou hast so willed it, that I should live among those,
and preach the Truth among those, who love vanity; and I cannot but be a
laughing-stock to them. “For we have been made a spectacle unto this
world, and unto angels, and unto men:” <span
id="fr_1065"></span>[1066](#fn_1065.md) to angels who praise, to men who
censure, us; or rather to angels, some of whom praise, some of whom are
censuring us: and to men also, some of whom are praising, and some
censuring us.…Both the one and the other are arms to us: the one “on the
right hand,” the other “on the left:” arms however they are both of
them; both of these kinds of arms, both those “on the right hand,” and
those “on the left;” both those who praise, and those who censure; both
those who pay us honour, and those who heap dishonour upon us; with both
these kinds I contend against the devil; with both of these I smite him;
I defeat him with prosperity, if I be not corrupted by it; by adversity,
if I am not broken in spirit by it.

<span id="ii.XXXIX-p70"></span>16. “I became dumb; <span
id="fr_1066"></span>[1067](#fn_1066.md) and I opened not my mouth” ([Psa.
39.9](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#009.md)<span
id="ii.XXXIX-p71.1"></span>). But it was to guard against “the foolish
man,” that “I became dumb, and opened not my mouth.” For to whom should
I tell what is going on within me? “For I will hear what the Lord God
will speak in me; <span id="fr_1067"></span>[1068](#fn_1067.md) for He will
speak peace unto His people.” <span id="fr_1068"></span>[1069](#fn_1068.md)
But “There is no peace,” saith the Lord, “to the wicked.” <span
id="fr_1069"></span>[1070](#fn_1069.md) “I was dumb, and opened not my
mouth; because it is Thou that madest me.” Was this the reason that thou
openedst not thy mouth, “because God made thee”? That is strange; for
did not God make thy mouth, that thou shouldest speak? “He that planted
the ear, doth He not hear? He that formed the eye, doth He not
see?” <span id="fr_1070"></span>[1071](#fn_1070.md) God hath given thee a
mouth to speak with; and dost thou say, “I was dumb, and opened not my
mouth, because Thou madest me”? Or does the clause, “Because Thou madest
me,” belong to the verse that follows? “Remove Thy stroke away from me”
([Psa. 39.10](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#010.md)<span
id="ii.XXXIX-p75.2"></span>). Because it is “Thou that hast made me,”
let it not be Thy pleasure to destroy me utterly; scourge, so that I may
be made better, not so that I faint; beat me, so that I may be <span
id="fr_1071"></span>[1072](#fn_1071.md) beaten out to a greater length and
breadth, not so that I may be ground to powder. “By the heaviness of Thy
hand I fainted in corrections.” That is, I “fainted” while Thou wast
correcting me. And what is meant by “correcting” me? except what
follows.

<span id="ii.XXXIX-p77"></span><span id="page_117">p. 117</span> <span
id="ii.XXXIX-Page_117"></span>17. “Thou with rebukes hast chastened man
for iniquity; Thou hast made my life to consume away like a spider”
([Psa. 39.11](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#011.md)<span
id="ii.XXXIX-p77.1"></span>). There is much that is discerned by this
Idithun; by every one who discerns as he does; who overleaps as he does.
For he says, that he has fainted in God’s corrections; and would fain
have the stroke removed away from him, “because it is He who made him.”
Let Him renew me, who also made me; let Him who created me, create me
anew. But yet, Brethren, do we suppose that there was no cause for his
fainting, so that he wishes to be “renewed,” to be “created anew”? It is
“for iniquity,” saith he, “that Thou hast chastened man.” All this, my
having fainted, my being weak, my “crying out of the deep,” all of this
is because of “iniquity;” and in this Thou hast not condemned, but hast
“chastened” me. “Thou hast chastened man for sin.” Hear this more
plainly from another Psalm: “It is good for me that Thou hast afflicted
me, that I might learn Thy righteousness.” <span
id="fr_1072"></span>[1073](#fn_1072.md) I have been “afflicted,” and at the
same time “it is good for me;” it is at once a punishment, and an act of
favour. What hath He in store for us after punishment is over, who
inflicts punishment itself by way of favour? For He it is of whom it was
said, “I was brought low, and He made me whole:” and, “It is good for me
that Thou hast afflicted me, that I might learn Thy
righteousness.” <span id="fr_1073"></span>[1074](#fn_1073.md) “Thou
chastenest man for iniquity.” And that which is written, “Thou formest
my grief in teaching me,” <span id="fr_1074"></span>[1075](#fn_1074.md)
could only be said unto God by one who was “leaping beyond” his fellows;
“Thou formest my grief in teaching me;” Thou makest, that is to say, a
lesson for me out of my sorrow. It is Thou that formest that very grief
itself; Thou dost not leave it unformed, but formest it; and that grief,
that has been inflicted by Thee, when formed, will be a lesson unto me,
that I may be set free by Thee. For the word *finges* is used in the
sense of “forming,” as it were moulding, my grief; not in the sense of
“feigning” it; in the same way that *fingit* is applied to the artist,
in the same sense that *figulus* is derived from *fingere.* Thou
therefore “hast chastened man for iniquity.” I see myself in
afflictions; I see myself under punishment; and I see no unrighteousness
in Thee. If I therefore am under punishment, and if there is no
unrighteousness with Thee, it remains that Thou must have been
“chastening man for iniquity.”

<span id="ii.XXXIX-p81"></span>18. And by what means hast Thou
“chastened” him? Tell us, O Idithun, the manner of thy chastening; tell
us in what way thou hast been “chastened.” “And Thou hast made my life
consume like a spider.” This is the chastening! What consumes away
sooner than the spider? I speak of the creature itself; though what can
be more liable to “consume away” than the spider’s webs? Observe too how
liable to decay is the creature itself. Do but set your finger lightly
upon it, and it is a ruin: there is nothing at all more easily
destroyed. To such a state hast Thou brought my life, by chastening me
“because of iniquity.” When chastening makes us weak, there is a kind of
strength that would be a fault.…It was by a kind of strength that man
offended, so as to require to be corrected by weakness: for it was by a
certain “pride” that he offended; so as to require to be chastened by
humility. All proud persons call themselves strong men. Therefore have
many “come from the East and the West,” and have attained “to sit down
with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of Heaven.” <span
id="fr_1075"></span>[1076](#fn_1075.md) Wherefore was it that they so
attained? Because they would not be strong. What is meant by “would not
be strong”? They were afraid to presume of their own merits. They did
not “go about to establish their own righteousness,” that they might
“submit themselves to the righteousness of God.” <span
id="fr_1076"></span>[1077](#fn_1076.md) …Behold! you are mortal; and you
bear about you a body of flesh that is corrupting away: “And ye shall
fall like one of the princes. Ye shall die like men,” <span
id="fr_1077"></span>[1078](#fn_1077.md) and shall fall like the
devil. <span id="fr_1078"></span>[1079](#fn_1078.md) What good does the
remedial discipline of mortality do you? The devil is proud, as not
having a mortal body, as being an angel. But as for you, who have
received a mortal body, and to whom even this does no good, so as to
humble you by so great weakness, you shall “fall like one of the
princes.” This then is the first grace of God’s gift, to bring us to the
confession of our infirmity, that whatever good we can do, whatever
ability we have, we may be that in Him; that “He that glorieth, may
glory in the Lord.” <span id="fr_1079"></span>[1080](#fn_1079.md) “When I
am weak,” saith he, “then am I strong.” <span
id="fr_1080"></span>[1081](#fn_1080.md)

<span id="ii.XXXIX-p88"></span>19. “But surely every man living
disquieteth himself in vain.” He returns to what he mentioned a little
before. Although he be improving here, yet for all that, “every man
living disquieteth himself in vain;” forasmuch as he lives in a state of
uncertainty. For who has any assurance even of his own goodness? “He is
disquieted in vain.” Let him “cast upon the Lord the burden” <span
id="fr_1081"></span>[1082](#fn_1081.md) of his care; let him cast upon Him
whatever causes him anxiety. “Let Him sustain thee;” let Him keep thee.
For on this earth what is there that is certain, except death? <span
id="page_118">p. 118</span> <span id="ii.XXXIX-Page_118"></span>Consider
the whole sum of all the good or the ill of this life, either those
belonging to righteousness, or those belonging to unrighteousness; what
is there that is certain here, except death? Have you been advancing in
goodness? You know what you are to-day; what you will be to-morrow, you
know not! Are you a sinner? you know what you are to-day; what you will
be to-morrow, you know not! You hope for wealth; it is uncertain whether
it will fall to your lot. You hope to have a wife; it is uncertain
whether you will obtain one, or what sort of one you will obtain. You
hope for sons: it is uncertain whether they will be born to you. Are
they born? it is uncertain whether they will live: if they live, it is
uncertain whether they will grow up in virtue, or whether they will fall
away. Whichever way you turn, all is uncertain, death alone is certain.
Art thou poor? It is uncertain whether thou wilt grow rich. Art thou
unlearned? It is uncertain whether thou wilt become learned. Art thou in
feeble health, it is uncertain whether thou wilt regain thy strength.
Art thou born? It is certain that thou wilt die: and in this certainty
of death itself, the day of thy death is uncertain. Amidst these
uncertainties, where death alone is certain, while even of that the hour
is uncertain, and while it alone is studiously guarded against, though
at the same time it is in no way to be escaped, “every man living
disquieteth himself in vain.”…

<span id="ii.XXXIX-p90"></span>20. “Hear my prayer, O Lord” ([Psa.
39.12](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#012.md)<span
id="ii.XXXIX-p90.1"></span>). Whereof shall I rejoice? Whereof should I
groan? I rejoice on account of what is past, I groan longing for these
which are not yet come. “Hear my prayer, and give ear unto my cry. Hold
not Thy peace at my tears.” For do I now no longer weep, because I have
already “passed by,” have “left behind” so great things as these? “Do I
not weep much the more?” For, “He that increaseth knowledge, increaseth
sorrow.” <span id="fr_1082"></span>[1083](#fn_1082.md) The more I long for
what is not here, do I not so much the more groan for it until it comes?
do I not so much the more weep until it comes?…

<span id="ii.XXXIX-p92"></span>21. “For I am a sojourner with Thee.” But
with whom am I a “sojourner”? When I was with the devil, I was a
“sojourner;” but then I had a bad host and entertainer; now, however, I
am with Thee; but I am a “sojourner” still. What is meant by a
sojourner? I am a “sojourner” in the place from which I am to remove;
not in the place where I am to dwell for ever. The place where I am to
abide for ever, should be rather called my home. In the place from which
I am to remove I am a “sojourner;” but yet it is with my God that I am a
sojourner, with whom I am hereafter to abide, when I have reached my
home. But what home is that to which you are to remove from this estate
of a sojourner? Recognise that home, of which the Apostle speaks, “We
have an habitation of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the
Heavens.” <span id="fr_1083"></span>[1084](#fn_1083.md) If this house is
eternal in the Heavens, when we have come to it, we shall not be
sojourners any more. For how should you be a sojourner in an eternal
home? But here, where the Master of the house is some day to say to you,
“Remove,” while you yourself know not when He will say it, be thou in
readiness. And by longing for your eternal home, you will be keeping
yourself in readiness for it. And be not angry with Him, because He
gives thee notice to remove, when He Himself pleases. For He made no
covenant with thee, nor did He bind Himself by any engagement; nor didst
thou enter upon the tenancy of this house on a certain stipulation for a
definite term: thou art to quit, when it is its Master’s pleasure. For
therefore is it that you now dwell there free of charge. “For I am a
sojourner with Thee, and a stranger.” Therefore it is there is my
country: it is there is my home. “I am a sojourner with Thee, and a
stranger.” Here too is understood “with Thee.” For many are strangers
with the devil: but they who have already believed and are faithful,
are, it is true, “strangers” as yet, because they have not yet come to
that country and to that home: but still they are strangers with God.
For so long as we are in the body, we are strangers from the Lord, and
we desire, whether we are strangers, or abiding here, “we may be
accepted with Him.” <span id="fr_1084"></span>[1085](#fn_1084.md) I am a
“sojourner with Thee; and a stranger, as all my fathers were.” If then I
am as all my fathers were, shall I say that I will not remove, when they
have removed? Am I to lodge here on other terms, than those on which
they lodged here also?…

<span id="ii.XXXIX-p95"></span>22. “Grant me some remission, that I may
be refreshed before I go hence” ([Psa.
39.13](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#013.md)<span
id="ii.XXXIX-p95.1"></span>). Consider well, Idithun, consider what
knots those are which thou wouldest have “loosed” unto thee, that thou
mightest be “refreshed before thou goest hence.” For thou hast certain
fever-heats from which thou wouldest fain be refreshed, and thou sayest,
“that I may be refreshed,” and “grant me a remission.” What should He
remit, or loosen unto thee, save that difficulty under which, and in
consequence of which, thou sayest, “Forgive us our debts. Grant me a
remission before I go hence, and be no more.” Set me free from my sins,
“before I go hence,” that I may not go hence with my <span
id="page_119">p. 119</span> <span id="ii.XXXIX-Page_119"></span>sins.
Remit them unto me, that I may be set at rest in my conscience, that it
may be disburthened of its feverish anxiety, the anxiety with which “I
am sorry for my sin. Grant me a remission, that I may be refreshed”
(before everything else), “before I go hence, and be no more.” For if
thou grantest me not a “remission, that I may be refreshed,” I shall “go
and be no more.” “Before I go” thither, where if I go, I shall
thenceforth “be no more. Grant me a remission, that I may be refreshed.”
A question has suggested itself, how he will be no more.…What is meant
then by “shall be no more,” unless Idithun is alluding to what is true
“being,” and what is not true “being.” For he was beholding with the
mind, with which he could do so, with the “mind’s eye,” by which he was
able to behold it, that end, which he had desired to have shown unto
him, saying, “Lord, make me to know mine end.” He was beholding “the
number of his days, which truly is;” and he observed that all that is
below, in comparison of that true being, has no true being. For those
things are permanent; these are subject to change; mortal, and frail,
and the eternal suffering, though full of corruption, is for this very
reason not to be ended, that it may ever be being ended without end. He
alluded therefore to that realm of bliss, to the happy country, to the
happy home, where the Saints are partakers of eternal Life, and of Truth
unchangeable; and he feared to “go” where that is not, where there is no
true being; longing to be there, where “Being” in the highest sense is!
It is on account of this contrast then, while standing midway between
them, he says, “Grant me a remission, that I may be refreshed before I
go hence and be no more.” For if Thou “grantest me not a remission” of
my sins, I shall go from Thee unto all eternity! And from whom shall I
go to all eternity? From Him who said, <span class="c21"><span
id="ii.XXXIX-p95.2"></span>I Am HE that Am</span>: from Him who said,
“Say unto the children of Israel, I <span class="c21"><span
id="ii.XXXIX-p95.3"></span>Am</span> hath sent me unto you.” <span
id="fr_1085"></span>[1086](#fn_1085.md) He then who goes from Him, in the
contrary direction, goes to non-existence.…
