<span id="ii.XLIV"></span>

<span id="ii.XLIV-p1"></span> <span id="ii.XLIV-p1.1"></span><span
class="c20"><span id="ii.XLIV-p1.2"></span>Psalm XLIV. <span
id="fr_1314"></span>[1315](#fn_1314.md) </span>

<span id="ii.XLIV-p3"></span>1. This Psalm is addressed “to the sons of
Korah,” as its title shows. Now Korah is equivalent to the word
baldness; <span id="fr_1315"></span>[1316](#fn_1315.md) and we find in the
Gospel that our Lord Jesus Christ was crucified in “the place of a
skull.” <span id="fr_1316"></span>[1317](#fn_1316.md) It is clear then that
this Psalm is sung to the “sons of His ‘Passion.’” Now we have on this
point a most certain and most evident testimony from the Apostle Paul;
because that at the time when the Church was suffering under the
persecutions of the Gentiles, he quoted from hence a verse, to insert by
way of consolation, and encouragement to patience. For that which he
inserted in his Epistle, is said here: “For Thy sake are we killed all
the day long; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter.” <span
id="fr_1317"></span>[1318](#fn_1317.md) Let us then hear in this Psalm the
voice of the Martyrs; and see how good is the cause which the voice of
the Martyrs pleads, saying, For Thy sake, etc.…

<span id="ii.XLIV-p7"></span>2. The title then is not simply “To the
sons of Korah,” but, “*For understanding*, to the sons of Korah.” This
is the case also with that Psalm, the first verse of which the Lord
Himself <span id="page_141">p. 141</span> <span
id="ii.XLIV-Page_141"></span>uttered on the Cross: “My God, My God, look
upon Me; why hast Thou forsaken Me?” <span
id="fr_1318"></span>[1319](#fn_1318.md) For “transferring us in a
figure” <span id="fr_1319"></span>[1320](#fn_1319.md) to what He was
saying, and to His own Body (for we are also “His Body,” and He is our
“Head”), He uttered from the Cross not His own cry, but ours. For God
never “forsook” Him: nor did He Himself ever depart from the Father; but
it was in behalf of us that He spake this: “My God, My God, why hast
thou forsaken Me?” For there follows, “Far from My health are the words
of My offences:” and it shows in whose person He said this; for sin
could not be found in Him.…

<span id="ii.XLIV-p10"></span>3. “O God, we have heard with our ears;
our fathers have told us the work that Thou didst in their days, and in
the days of old” ([Psa. 44.1](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#001.md)<span
id="ii.XLIV-p10.1"></span>). Wondering wherefore, in these days, He has
seemingly forsaken those whom it was His will to exercise in sufferings,
they recall the past events which they have heard of from their fathers;
as if they said, It is not of these things that we suffer, that our
fathers told us! For in that other Psalm also, He said this, “Our
fathers trusted in Thee; they trusted, and Thou didst deliver them. But
I am a worm and no man; a reproach of men, and the outcast of the
people.” <span id="fr_1320"></span>[1321](#fn_1320.md) They trusted, and
Thou didst deliver them; have I then hoped, and hast Thou *forsaken* me?
And have I believed upon Thee in vain? And is it in vain that my name
has been written in Thy Book, <span id="fr_1321"></span>[1322](#fn_1321.md)
and Thy name has been inscribed on me? What our fathers told us was
this:

<span id="ii.XLIV-p13"></span>“Thy hand destroyed the nations; and Thou
plantedst them: Thou didst weaken the peoples, and cast them out” ([Psa.
44.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#002)<span id="ii.XLIV-p13.1"></span>.md).
That is to say: “Thou didst drive out ‘the peoples’ from their own land,
that Thou mightest bring ‘them’ in, and plant them; and mightest by Thy
mercy stablish their kingdom.” These are the things that we heard from
our fathers. But perhaps it was because they were brave, were men of
battle, were invincible, were well-disciplined, and warlike, that they
could do these things. Far from it. This is not what our fathers told
us; this is not what is contained in Scripture. But what does it say,
but what follows?

<span id="ii.XLIV-p14"></span>“For they gat not the land in possession
by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them; but Thy right
hand, and Thine arm, and the light of Thy countenance” ([Psa.
44.3](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#003)<span id="ii.XLIV-p14.1"></span>.md).
Thy “right hand” is Thy Power: Thine “arm” is Thy Son Himself. <span
id="fr_1322"></span>[1323](#fn_1322.md) And “the light of Thy countenance.”
What means this, but that Thou wert present with them, in miracles of
such a sort that Thy presence was perceived. For when God’s presence
with us appears by any miracle, do we see His face with our own eyes?
No. It is by the effect of the miracle He intimates to man His presence.
In fact, what do all persons say, who express wonder at facts of this
description? “I saw God present.” “But Thy right hand, and Thine arm,
and the light of Thy countenance; because Thou pleasedst in them:” <span
id="fr_1323"></span>[1324](#fn_1323.md) i.e. didst so deal with them, that
Thou wert well-pleasing in them: that whoso considered how they were
being dealt with, might say, that “God is with them of a truth;” and it
is God that moves <span id="fr_1324"></span>[1325](#fn_1324.md) them.

<span id="ii.XLIV-p18"></span>4. “What? Was He then other than now He
is?” Away with the supposition. For what follows?

<span id="ii.XLIV-p19"></span>“Thou art Thyself <span
id="fr_1325"></span>[1326](#fn_1325.md) my King and my God.” ([Psa.
44.4](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#004)<span id="ii.XLIV-p20.1"></span>.md).
“Thou art Thyself;” for Thou art not changed. I see that the times are
changed; but the Creator of times is unchanged. “Thou art Thyself my
King and my God.” Thou art wont to guide me: to govern me, to save me.
“Thou who commandest salvation unto Jacob.” What is, “Thou who
commandest”? Even though in Thine own proper Substance and Nature, in
which Thou art whatsoever Thou art, Thou wast hid from them; and though
Thou didst not converse with the fathers in that which Thou art in
Thyself, so that they could see Thee “face to face,” yet by any created
being whatsoever “Thou commandest salvation unto Israel.” For that sight
of Thee “face to face” is reserved for those set free in the
Resurrection. And the very “fathers” of the New Testament too, although
they saw Thy mysteries revealed, although they preached the secret
things so revealed to them, nevertheless said that they themselves saw
but “in a glass, darkly,” but that “seeing face to face”  <span
id="fr_1326"></span>[1327](#fn_1326.md) is reserved to a future time, when
what the Apostle himself speaks of shall have come. “When Christ our
life shall appear, then shall ye also appear with Him in glory.” <span
id="fr_1327"></span>[1328](#fn_1327.md) It is against that time then that
vision “face to face” is reserved for you, of which John also speaks:
“Beloved, we are now the sons of God: and it doth not yet appear what we
shall be. We know that, when He shall appear, we shall be like Him; for
we shall see Him as He is.” <span id="fr_1328"></span>[1329](#fn_1328.md)
Although then at that time our fathers saw Thee not as Thou art, “face
to face,” although that vision is reserved against the resurrection,
yet, even though they were Angels who presented themselves, it is Thou,
“Who commandest salvation unto Jacob.” Thou art not only present by
Thine own Self; <span id="page_142">p. 142</span> <span
id="ii.XLIV-Page_142"></span>but by whatsoever created being Thou didst
appear, it is Thou that dost “command” by them, that which Thou doest by
Thine own Self in order to the salvation of Thy servants: but that which
they do whom Thou “commandest” it, is done to procure the salvation of
Thy servants. Since then Thou art Thyself “my King and my God, and Thou
commandest salvation unto Jacob,” wherefore are we suffering these
things?

<span id="ii.XLIV-p24"></span>5. But perhaps it is only what is past
that has been described to us: but nothing of the kind is to be hoped
for by us for the future. Nay indeed, it is still to be hoped for.
“Through Thee will we winnow away <span
id="fr_1329"></span>[1330](#fn_1329.md) our enemies” ([Psa.
44.5](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#005)<span id="ii.XLIV-p25.1"></span>.md).
Our fathers then have declared to us a work that Thou didst “in their
days, and in the days of old,” that Thy hand destroyed the Gentiles:
that Thou “didst cast out the peoples; and didst plant them.” Such was
the past; but what is to be hereafter? “Through Thee we shall winnow
away our enemies.” A time will come, when all the enemies of Christians
will be winnowed away like chaff, be blown like dust, and be cast off
from the earth.…Thus much of the future. “I will not trust in my bow,”
even as our fathers did not in “their sword. Neither shall my sword help
me” ([Psa. 44.6](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#006.md)<span
id="ii.XLIV-p25.2"></span>).

<span id="ii.XLIV-p26"></span>6. “For Thou hast saved us from our
enemies” ([Psa. 44.7](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#007.md)<span
id="ii.XLIV-p26.1"></span>). This too is spoken of the future under the
figure of the past. But this is the reason that it is spoken of as if it
were past, that it is as certain as if it were past. Give heed,
wherefore many things are expressed by the Prophets as if they were
past; whereas it is things future, not past facts that are the subject
of prophecy. For the future Passion of our Lord Himself was
foretold: <span id="fr_1330"></span>[1331](#fn_1330.md) and yet it says,
“They pierced My hands and My feet. They told all My bones;” not, “They
shall pierce,” and “shall tell.” “They looked and stared upon Me;” not
“They shall look and stare upon Me.” “They parted My garments among
them.” It does not say, “They shall part” them. All these things are
expressed as if they were past, although they were yet to come: because
to God things to come also are as certain as if they were past.…It is
for this reason, in consequence of their certainty, that those things
which are yet future, are spoken of as if past. This it is then that we
hope. For it is, “Thou hast saved us from our enemies, and hast put them
to shame that hated us.”

<span id="ii.XLIV-p28"></span>7. “In God will we boast <span
id="fr_1331"></span>[1332](#fn_1331.md) all the day long” ([Psa.
44.8](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#008)<span id="ii.XLIV-p29.1"></span>.md).
Observe how he intermingles words expressive of a future time, that you
may perceive that what was spoken of before as in past time was foretold
of future times. “In God will we boast all day long; and in Thy name
will we confess for ever.” <span id="fr_1332"></span>[1333](#fn_1332.md)
What is, “We shall boast”? What, “We shall confess”? That Thou hast
“saved us from our enemies;” that Thou art to give us an everlasting
kingdom: that in us are to be fulfilled the words, “Blessed are they
that dwell in Thine house: they will be always praising Thee.” <span
id="fr_1333"></span>[1334](#fn_1333.md)

<span id="ii.XLIV-p32"></span>8. Since then we have the certainty that
these things are to be hereafter, and since we have heard from our
fathers that those we spoke of were in time past, what is our state at
present? “But now Thou hast cast us off, and put us to shame” ([Psa.
44.9](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#009)<span id="ii.XLIV-p32.1"></span>.md).
Thou hast “put us to shame” not before our own consciences, but in the
sight of men. For there was a time when Christians were persecuted; when
in every place they were outcasts, when in every place it used to be
said, “He is a Christian!” as if it conveyed an insult and reproach.
Where then is He, “our God, our King,” who “commands salvation unto
Jacob”? Where is He who did all those works, which “our fathers have
told us”? Where is He who is hereafter to do all those things which He
revealed unto us by His Spirit? Is He changed? No. These things are done
in order to “understanding, for the sons of Korah.” For we ought to
“understand” something of the reason, why He has willed we should suffer
all these things in the mean time. What “all things”? “But now Thou hast
cast us off and put us to shame: and goest not forth, O God, in our
powers.” <span id="fr_1334"></span>[1335](#fn_1334.md) We go forth to meet
our enemies, and Thou goest not forth with us. We see them: they are
very strong, and we are without strength. Where is that might of Thine?
Where Thy “right hand,” and Thy power? <span
id="fr_1335"></span>[1336](#fn_1335.md) Where the sea dried up, and the
Egyptian pursuers overwhelmed with the waves? Where Amalek’s resistance
subdued by the sign of the Cross? <span
id="fr_1336"></span>[1337](#fn_1336.md) “And Thou, O God, goest not forth
in our powers.”

<span id="ii.XLIV-p36"></span>9. “Thou hast turned us away backward in
presence of our enemies” ([Psa.
44.10](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#010.md)<span
id="ii.XLIV-p36.1"></span>), so that they are, as it were, before; we,
behind; they are counted as conquerors, we as conquered. “And they which
hate us spoiled for themselves.” What did they “spoil” but ourselves?

<span id="ii.XLIV-p37"></span>10. “Thou has given us like sheep
appointed for meat, and hast scattered us among the nations” ([Psa.
44.11](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#011.md)<span
id="ii.XLIV-p37.1"></span>). We have been “devoured” by “the nations.”
Those persons are meant, who, through their sufferings, have by process
of assimilation, becomes part of the “body” of the Gentile world. For
the Church mourns over <span id="page_143">p. 143</span> <span
id="ii.XLIV-Page_143"></span>them, as over members of her body, that
have been devoured.  <span id="fr_1337"></span>[1338](#fn_1337.md)

<span id="ii.XLIV-p39"></span>11. “Thou hast sold Thy people for no
price” ([Psa. 44.12](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#012.md)<span
id="ii.XLIV-p39.1"></span>). For we see whom Thou hast made over; what
Thou hast received, we have not seen. “And there was no multitude in
their jubilees.” <span id="fr_1338"></span>[1339](#fn_1338.md) For when the
Christians were flying before the pursuit of enemies, who were
idolaters, were there then held any congregations and “jubilees” to the
honour of God? Were those Hymns chanted in concert from the Churches of
God, that are wont to be sung in concert in time of peace, and to be
sounded in a sweet accord of the brotherhood in the ears of God?

<span id="ii.XLIV-p41"></span>12. “Thou madest us a reproach to our
neighbours; a scorn and a derision to them that are round about us”
([Psa. 44.13](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#013.md)<span
id="ii.XLIV-p41.1"></span>). “Thou madest us a similitude <span
id="fr_1339"></span>[1340](#fn_1339.md) among the heathen” ([Psa.
44.14](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#014.md)<span
id="ii.XLIV-p42.1"></span>). What is meant by a “similitude”? It is when
men in imprecating a curse make a “similitude” of his name whom they
detest. “So mayest thou die;” “So mayest thou be punished!” What a
number of such reproaches were then uttered! “So mayest thou be
crucified!” Even in the present day there are not wanting enemies of
Christ (those very Jews themselves), against whom whensoever we defend
Christ, they say unto us, “So mayest thou die as He did.” For they would
not have inflicted that kind of death had they not an intense horror of
dying by such a death: or had they been able to comprehend what mystery
was contained in it. When the ointment is applied to the eyes of the
blind man, he does not see the eye-salve in the physician’s hand. For
the very Cross was made for the benefit even of the persecutors
themselves. Hereby they were healed afterwards; and they believed in Him
whom they themselves had slain. “Thou madest us a similitude among the
heathen; a shaking of the head among the peoples,” a “shaking of the
head” by way of insult. “They spake with their lips, they shook the
head.” <span id="fr_1340"></span>[1341](#fn_1340.md) This they did to the
Lord: this to all His Saints also, whom they were able to pursue, to lay
hold of, to mock, to betray, to afflict, and to slay.

<span id="ii.XLIV-p44"></span>13. “My shame is continually before me;
and the confusion of my face has covered me” ([Psa.
44.15](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#015.md)<span
id="ii.XLIV-p44.1"></span>). “For the voice of him that reproacheth and
blasphemeth” ([Psa. 44.16](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#016.md)<span
id="ii.XLIV-p44.2"></span>): that is to say, from the voice of them that
insult over me, and who make it a charge against me that I worship Thee,
that I confess Thee! and who make it a charge against me that I bear
that name by which all charges against me shall be blotted out. “For the
voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth,” that is, of him that
speaketh against me. “By reason of the enemy and the persecutor.” And
what is the “understanding” conveyed here? Those things which are told
us of the time past, will not be done in our case: <span
id="fr_1341"></span>[1342](#fn_1341.md) those which are hoped for, as to be
hereafter, are not as yet manifest. Those which are past, as the leading
out of Thy people with great glory from Egypt; its deliverance from its
persecutors; the guiding of it through the nations, the placing of it in
the kingdom, whence the nations had been expelled. What are those to be
hereafter? The leading of the people out of this Egypt of the world,
when Christ, our “leader” shall appear in His glory: the placing of the
Saints at His right hand; of the wicked at His left; the condemnation of
the wicked with the devil to eternal punishment; the receiving of a
kingdom from Christ with the Saints to last for ever. <span
id="fr_1342"></span>[1343](#fn_1342.md) These are the things that are yet
to be: the former are what are past. In the interval, what is to be our
lot? Tribulations! “Why so?” That it may be seen with respect to the
soul that worships God, to what extent it worships God; that it may be
seen whether it worships Him “freely” from whom it received salvation
“freely.”…What hast thou given unto God? Thou wert wicked, and thou wert
redeemed! What hast thou given unto God? What is there that thou hast
not “received” from Him “freely”? With reason is it named “grace,”
because it is bestowed (*gratis*, i.e.) freely. <span
id="fr_1343"></span>[1344](#fn_1343.md) What is required of thee then is
this, “that thou too shouldest worship “Him freely;” not because He
gives thee things temporal, but because He holds out to thee things
eternal.…

<span id="ii.XLIV-p48"></span>14. “All this is come upon us; yet have we
not forgotten Thee” ([Psa. 44.17](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#017.md)<span
id="ii.XLIV-p48.1"></span>). What is meant by, “have not forgotten
Thee”? “Neither have we behaved ourselves frowardly in Thy covenant.”

<span id="ii.XLIV-p49"></span>“Our heart has not turned back; and Thou
hast turned aside our goings out of Thy way” ([Psa.
44.18](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#018.md)<span
id="ii.XLIV-p49.1"></span>). See here is “understanding,” in that “our
heart has not gone back;” that we have not “forgotten Thee, have not
behaved frowardly in Thy covenant;” placed as we are in great
tribulations, and persecutions of the Gentiles. “Thou hast turned aside
our goings out of Thy way.” Our “goings” were in the pleasures of the
world; our “goings” were in the midst of temporal prosperities. Thou
hast taken “our <span id="page_144">p. 144</span> <span
id="ii.XLIV-Page_144"></span>goings out of Thy way;” and hast shown
us <span id="fr_1344"></span>[1345](#fn_1344.md) how “strait and narrow is
the way that leadeth unto life.” <span
id="fr_1345"></span>[1346](#fn_1345.md) What is meant by, “hast turned
aside our goings out of Thy way”? It is as if He said, “Ye are placed in
the midst of tribulation; ye are suffering many things; ye have already
lost many things that ye loved in this life: but I have not abandoned
you on the way, the narrow way that I am teaching you. Ye were seeking
“broad ways.” What do I tell you? This is the way we go to everlasting
life; by the way ye wish to walk, ye are going to death. How “broad and
wide is the road that leads to destruction: and” how “many there be that
find it! How strait and narrow the way that leadeth unto life, and” how
“few there be” that walk therein! <span
id="fr_1346"></span>[1347](#fn_1346.md) Who are the few? They who patiently
endure tribulations, patiently endure temptations; who in all these
troubles do not “fall away:” who do not rejoice in the word “for a
season” only; and in the time of tribulation fade away, as on the sun’s
arising; but who have the “root” of “love,” according to what we have
lately heard read in the Gospel. <span
id="fr_1347"></span>[1348](#fn_1347.md) …

<span id="ii.XLIV-p54"></span>15. “For Thou hast brought us low in the
place of infirmity” <span id="fr_1348"></span>[1349](#fn_1348.md) ([Psa.
44.18](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#018.md)<span
id="ii.XLIV-p55.1"></span>): therefore Thou wilt exalt us in the place
of strength. “And the shadow of death has covered us” ([Psa.
44.19](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#019.md)<span
id="ii.XLIV-p55.2"></span>). For this mortality of ours is but the
“shadow” of death. The true death is condemnation with the devil.

<span id="ii.XLIV-p56"></span>16. “If we have forgotten the Name of our
God.” Here is the “understanding” of the “sons of Korah.” “And stretched
out our hands to a strange God” ([Psa.
44.20](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#020.md)<span
id="ii.XLIV-p56.1"></span>). “Shall not God search this out? For He
knoweth the secrets of the heart” ([Psa.
44.21](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#021.md)<span
id="ii.XLIV-p56.2"></span>). He “knows,” and yet He “searches them out”?
If He knows the secrets of the heart, what do the words, “Shall not God
search it out,” do there? He “knows” it in Himself; He “searches it out”
for our sakes. For it is for this reason God sometimes “searches a thing
out;” and speaks of that becoming known to Himself, which He is Himself
making known to thee. He is speaking of His own work, not of His
knowledge. We commonly say, “A gladsome day,” when it is fine. Yet is it
the day itself that experiences delight? No: we speak of the day as
gladsome, because it fills us with delight. And we speak of a “sullen
sky.” Not that there is any such feeling in the clouds, but because men
are affected with sullenness at the sight of such an appearance of the
skies, it is called sullen for this reason, that it makes us sullen. So
also God is said to “know” when He causes us to know. God says to
Abraham, “Now I know that thou fearest God.” <span
id="fr_1349"></span>[1350](#fn_1349.md) Did He then not know it before
then? But Abraham did not know himself till then: for it was in that
very trial he came to know himself.…And God is said to “know” that which
He had caused him to know. Did Peter know himself, when he said to the
Physician, “I will be with Thee even unto death?” <span
id="fr_1350"></span>[1351](#fn_1350.md) The Physician had felt his
pulse, <span id="fr_1351"></span>[1352](#fn_1351.md) and knew what was
going on within His patient’s soul: the patient knew it not. The
crisis <span id="fr_1352"></span>[1353](#fn_1352.md) of trial came; and the
Physician approved the correctness of His opinion: the sick man gave up
his presumption. Thus God at once “knows” it and “searches it out.” “He
knows it already. Why does He ‘search it out’?” For thy sake: that thou
mayest come to know thine own self, and mayest return thanks to Him that
made thee. “Shall not God search it out?”

<span id="ii.XLIV-p61"></span>17. “For, for Thy sake we are killed all
the day long: we are counted as sheep for the slaughter” ([Psa.
44.22](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#022.md)<span
id="ii.XLIV-p61.1"></span>). For you may see a man being put to death;
you do not know why he is being put to death. God knoweth this. The
thing in itself is hid. But some one will say to me, “See, he is
detained in prison for the name of Christ, he is a confessor for the
name of Christ.” Why do not  <span id="fr_1353"></span>[1354](#fn_1353.md)
heretics also confess the name of Christ, and yet they do not die for
His sake? Nay more; let me say it, in the Catholic Church itself, do you
think there either are, or have been wanting persons such as would
suffer for the sake of glory among men? Were there no such persons, the
Apostle would not say, “Though I give my body to be burned, and have not
charity, it profiteth me nothing.” <span
id="fr_1354"></span>[1355](#fn_1354.md) He knew therefore that there might
be some persons, who did this not from “charity,” but out of vainglory.
It is therefore hid from us; God alone sees this; we cannot see it. He
alone can judge of this, who “knoweth the secrets of the heart.” “For,”
for Thy sake “are we killed all the day long; we are counted as sheep
for the slaughter.” I have already mentioned that from hence the Apostle
Paul had borrowed a text <span id="fr_1355"></span>[1356](#fn_1355.md) for
the encouragement of the Martyrs: that they might not “faint in the
tribulations” undergone by them for the name of Christ. <span
id="fr_1356"></span>[1357](#fn_1356.md)

<span id="ii.XLIV-p66"></span>18. “Awake; why sleepest Thou, O Lord?”
([Psa. 44.23](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#023.md)<span
id="ii.XLIV-p66.1"></span>). Who is addressed, and who is the speaker?
Would not he be more correctly said to *sleep* and slumber, <span
id="fr_1357"></span>[1358](#fn_1357.md) who speaks such words as these? He
replies to you, I know what I am saying: I know that “He that keepeth
Israel <span id="page_145">p. 145</span> <span
id="ii.XLIV-Page_145"></span>doth not sleep:” <span
id="fr_1358"></span>[1359](#fn_1358.md) but yet the Martyrs cry, “Awake;
why sleepest Thou, O Lord?” O Lord Jesus, Thou wast slain; Thou didst
“sleep” in Thy Passion; to us Thou hast now “awaked” from sleep. For
“we” know that Thou hast now “awaked” again. To what purpose hast Thou
awaked and risen again? The Gentiles that persecute us, think Thee to be
dead; do not believe Thee to have risen again. “Arise Thou” then to them
also! “Why sleepest Thou,” though not to us, yet to them? For if they
already believed Thee to have risen again, could they persecute us who
believe in Thee? But why do they persecute? “Destroy, slay so and so,
whoever have believed in Thee, such an one, who died an ill death!” As
yet to them “Thou sleepest;” arise to them, that they may perceive that
Thou hast “awaked” again; and may be at rest. Lastly, it has come to
pass, while the Martyrs die, and say these things; while they sleep, and
“awaken” Christ, truly dead in their sleepings, Christ has, in a certain
sense, risen again in the Gentiles; i.e. it becomes believed, that He
has risen again; so by degrees they themselves, becoming converted to
Christ by believing, collected a numerous body: such as the persecutors
dreaded; and the persecutions have come to an end. Why? Because Christ,
who before was *asleep* to them, as not believing, hath risen in the
Gentiles. “Arise, and cast us not off for ever!”

<span id="ii.XLIV-p69"></span>19. “Wherefore hidest Thou Thy face:” as
if Thou wert not present; as if thou hadst forgotten us? “And forgettest
our misery and trouble?” ([Psa.
44.24](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#024.md)<span
id="ii.XLIV-p69.1"></span>).

<span id="ii.XLIV-p70"></span>20. “For our soul is bowed down to the
dust” ([Psa. 44.25](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#025.md)<span
id="ii.XLIV-p70.1"></span>). Where is it bowed down? “To the dust:” i.e.
*dust* persecutes us. They persecute us, of whom Thou hast said, “The
ungodly are not so; but are like the dust, which the wind driveth away
from the face of the earth.” <span id="fr_1359"></span>[1360](#fn_1359.md)
“Our belly hath cleaved to the earth.” He seems to me to have expressed
the punishment of the extreme of humiliation, in which, when any one
prostrates himself, “his belly cleaveth to the earth.” For whosoever is
humbled so as to be on his knees, has yet a lower degree of humiliation
to which he can come: but he who is so humbled, that his “belly cleaveth
to the ground,” there is no farther humiliation for him. Should one wish
to do still farther, it will, after that point, be not bowing him down,
but crushing him. Perhaps then he may have meant this: We are “bowed
down very low” in this dust; there is no farther point to which
humiliation can go. Humiliation has now reached its highest point: let
mercy then come also.…

<span id="ii.XLIV-p72"></span>21. “Arise, O Lord, help us” ([Psa.
44.26](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#026.md)<span
id="ii.XLIV-p72.1"></span>). And indeed, dearly beloved, He has arisen
and helped us. For when he awaked (i.e. when He arose again, and became
known to the Gentiles) on the cessation of persecutions, even those who
had cleaved to the earth were raised up from the earth, and on
performing penance, <span id="fr_1360"></span>[1361](#fn_1360.md) have been
restored to Christ’s body, feeble and imperfect though they were: so
that in them was fulfilled the text, “Thine eyes did see my substance
yet being imperfect; and in Thy book shall they all be written.” <span
id="fr_1361"></span>[1362](#fn_1361.md)

<span id="ii.XLIV-p75"></span>“Arise, O Lord, help us, and redeem us for
Thy Name’s sake;” that is to say, freely; for Thy Name’s sake, not for
the sake of my merits: because Thou hast vouchsafed to do it, not
because I am worthy that Thou shouldest do it unto me. For this very
thing, that “we have not forgotten Thee;” that “our heart hath not gone
back;” that we “have not stretched out our hands to any strange god;”
how should we have been able to achieve, except with Thy help? How
should we have strength for it, except through Thy appealing to us
within, exhorting us, and not forsaking us? Whether then we suffer in
tribulations, or rejoice in prosperities, redeem Thou us, not for our
merits, but for Thy Name’s sake.
