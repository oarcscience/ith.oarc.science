<span id="ii.XXVI-p1"></span> <span id="ii.XXVI-p1.1"></span><span
class="c20"><span id="ii.XXVI-p1.2"></span>Psalm XXVI. <span
id="fr_641"></span>[642](#fn_641) </span>

<span id="ii.XXVI-p3"></span>Of David himself.

<span id="ii.XXVI-p4"></span>1. It may be attributed to David himself,
not the Mediator, the Man Christ Jesus, but the whole Church now
perfectly established in Christ.

<span id="ii.XXVI-p5"></span>2. “Judge me, O Lord, for I have walked in
my innocence” ([Psa. 26.1](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#001)<span
id="ii.XXVI-p5.1"></span>). Judge me, O Lord, for, after the mercy which
Thou first showedst <span id="fr_642"></span>[643](#fn_642) me, I have
some desert of my innocence, the way whereof I have kept. “And trusting
in the Lord I shall not be moved.” And yet not even so trusting in
myself, but in the Lord, I shall abide in Him.

<span id="ii.XXVI-p7"></span>3. “Prove me, O Lord, and try me” ([Psa.
26.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#002)<span id="ii.XXVI-p7.1"></span>).
Lest, however, any of my secret sins should be hid from me, prove me, O
Lord, and try me, making me known, not to Thee from whom nothing is hid,
but to myself, and to men. “Burn my reins and my heart.” Apply a
remedial purgation, as it were fire, to my pleasures and thoughts. “For
Thy mercy is before mine eyes” ([Psa.
26.3](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#003)<span id="ii.XXVI-p7.2"></span>).
For, that I be not consumed by that fire, not my merits, but Thy mercy,
whereby Thou hast brought me on to such a life, is before my eyes. “And
I have been pleasing in Thy truth.” And since my own falsehood hath been
displeasing to me, but Thy truth pleasing, I have myself been pleasing
also with it and in it.

<span id="ii.XXVI-p8"></span>4. “I have not sat with the council of
vanity” ([Psa. 26.4](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#004)<span
id="ii.XXVI-p8.1"></span>). I have not chosen to give my heart to them
who endeavour to provide, what is impossible, how they may be blessed in
the enjoyment of things transitory. “And I will not enter in with them
that work wickedly.” And since this is the very cause of all wickedness,
therefore I will not have my conscience hid, with them that work
wickedly.

<span id="ii.XXVI-p9"></span>5. “I have hated the congregation of evil
doers.” But to arrive at this council of vanity, congregations of evil
doers are formed, which I have hated. “And I will not sit with the
un<span id="page_64">p. 64</span> <span
id="ii.XXVI-Page_64"></span>godly” ([Psa.
26.5](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#005)<span id="ii.XXVI-p9.1"></span>).
And, therefore, with such a council, with the ungodly, I will not sit,
that is, I will not place my consent. <span
id="fr_643"></span>[644](#fn_643) “And I will not sit with the ungodly.”

<span id="ii.XXVI-p11"></span>6. “I will wash mine hands amid the
innocent” ([Psa. 26.6](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#006)<span
id="ii.XXVI-p11.1"></span>). I will make clean my works among the
innocent: among the innocent will I wash mine hands, with which I shall
embrace Thy glorious gifts. <span id="fr_644"></span>[645](#fn_644) “And
I will compass Thy altar, O Lord.” <span
id="fr_645"></span>[646](#fn_645)

<span id="ii.XXVI-p14"></span>7. “That I may hear the voice of Thy
praise.” That I may learn how to praise Thee. “And that I may declare
all Thy wondrous works” ([Psa.
26.7](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#007)<span id="ii.XXVI-p14.1"></span>).
And after I have learnt, I may set forth all Thy wondrous works.

<span id="ii.XXVI-p15"></span>8. “O Lord, I have loved the beauty of Thy
house:” of Thy Church. “And the place of the habitation of Thy glory”
([Psa. 26.8](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#008)<span
id="ii.XXVI-p15.1"></span>): where Thou dwellest, and art glorified.

<span id="ii.XXVI-p16"></span>9. “Destroy not my soul with the ungodly”
([Psa. 26.9](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#009)<span
id="ii.XXVI-p16.1"></span>). Destroy not then, together with them that
hate Thee, my soul, which hath loved the beauty of Thy house. “And my
life with the men of blood.” And with them that hate their neighbour.
For Thy house is beautified with the two commandments. <span
id="fr_646"></span>[647](#fn_646)

<span id="ii.XXVI-p18"></span>10. “In whose hands is wickedness.”
Destroy me not then with the ungodly and the men of blood, whose works
are wicked. “Their right hand is full of gifts” ([Psa.
26.10](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#010)<span
id="ii.XXVI-p18.1"></span>). And that which was given them to obtain
eternal salvation, they have converted into the receiving this world’s
gifts, “supposing that godliness is a trade.” <span
id="fr_647"></span>[648](#fn_647)

<span id="ii.XXVI-p20"></span>11. “But I have walked in mine innocence:
deliver me, and have mercy on me” ([Psa.
26.11](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#011)<span
id="ii.XXVI-p20.1"></span>). Let so great a price of my Lord’s Blood
avail for my complete deliverance: and in the dangers of this life let
not Thy mercy leave me.

<span id="ii.XXVI-p21"></span>12. “My foot hath stood in uprightness.”
My Love hath not withdrawn from Thy righteousness. “In the Churches I
will bless Thee, O Lord” ([Psa.
26.12](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#012)<span
id="ii.XXVI-p21.1"></span>). I will not hide Thy blessing, O Lord, from
those whom Thou hast called; for next to the love of Thee I join the
love of my neighbour.
