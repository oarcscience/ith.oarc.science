<span id="ii.CIV-p1"></span> <span id="ii.CIV-p1.1"></span><span
class="c20"><span id="ii.CIV-p1.2"></span>Psalm CIV. <span
id="fr_4692"></span>[4693](#fn_4692.md) </span>

<span id="ii.CIV-p3"></span>1. …“Bless the Lord, O my soul.” Let the
soul of us all, made one in Christ, say this. “O Lord my God, Thou art
magnified exceedingly!” ([Psa.
104.1](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#001)<span id="ii.CIV-p3.1"></span>.md).
Where art Thou magnified? “Confession and beauty Thou hast put on.”
Confess ye, that ye may be beautified, that He may put you on. “Clothed
with light as a garment” ([Psa.
104.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#002)<span id="ii.CIV-p3.2"></span>.md).
Clothed with His Church, because she is made “light” in Him, who before
was darkness in herself, as the apostle saith: “Ye were sometime
darkness, but now light in the Lord.” <span
id="fr_4693"></span>[4694](#fn_4693.md) “Stretching out the heaven like a
skin:” either as easily as thou dost a skin, if it be “as easily,” so
that thou mayest take it after the letter; or let us understand the
authority of the Scriptures, spread out over the whole world, under the
name of a skin; because mortality is signified in a skin, <span
id="fr_4694"></span>[4695](#fn_4694.md) but all the authority of the Divine
Scriptures was dispensed unto us through mortal men, whose fame is still
spreading abroad now they are dead.

<span id="ii.CIV-p6"></span>2. “Who covereth with waters the upper parts
thereof” ([Psa. 104.3](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#003.md)<span
id="ii.CIV-p6.1"></span>). The upper parts of what? Of Heaven. What is
Heaven? Figuratively only we said, the Divine Scripture. What are the
upper parts of the Divine Scripture? The commandment of love, than which
there is none more exalted. <span id="fr_4695"></span>[4696](#fn_4695.md)
But wherefore is love compared to waters? Because “the love of God is
shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who is given unto
us.” <span id="fr_4696"></span>[4697](#fn_4696.md) Whence is the Spirit
Himself water? because “Jesus stood and cried, He that believeth on Me,
out of his bosom shall flow rivers of living water.” <span
id="fr_4697"></span>[4698](#fn_4697.md) Whence do we prove that it was said
of the Spirit? Let the Evangelist himself declare, who followeth it up,
and saith, “But this spake He of the Spirit, which they were to receive,
who should believe on Him.” “Who walketh above the wings of the winds;”
that is, above the virtues of souls. What is the virtue of a soul? Love
itself. But how doth He walk above it? Because the love of God toward us
is greater than ours toward God.

<span id="ii.CIV-p10"></span>3. “Who maketh spirits His angels, and
flaming fire His ministers” ([Psa.
104.4](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#004)<span id="ii.CIV-p10.1"></span>.md):
that is, those who are already spirits, who are spiritual, not carnal,
He maketh His Angels, by sending them to preach His gospel. “And flaming
fire His ministers.” For unless the minister that preacheth be on fire,
he enflameth not him to whom he preacheth.

<span id="ii.CIV-p11"></span>4. “He hath founded the earth upon its
firmness” ([Psa. 104.5](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#005.md)<span
id="ii.CIV-p11.1"></span>). He hath founded the Church upon the firmness
of the Church. What is the firmness of the Church, but the foundation of
the Church. What is the foundation of the Church, but that of which the
Apostle saith, “Other foundation can no man lay but that is laid, which
is Christ Jesus.” <span id="fr_4698"></span>[4699](#fn_4698.md) And
therefore, grounded on such a foundation, what hath she deserved to
hear? “It shall not be bowed forever and ever.” “He founded the earth on
its firmness.” That is, He hath founded the Church upon Christ the
foundation. The Church will totter if the foundation totter; but when
shall Christ totter, before whose coming unto us, and taking flesh on
Him, “all things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything
made;” <span id="fr_4699"></span>[4700](#fn_4699.md) who holdeth all things
by His Majesty, <span id="fr_4700"></span>[4701](#fn_4700.md) and us by His
goodness? Since Christ faileth not, “she shall not be bowed for ever and
ever.” Where are they <span id="fr_4701"></span>[4702](#fn_4701.md) who say
that the Church hath perished from the world, when she cannot even be
bowed.…

<span id="ii.CIV-p16"></span>5. “The deep, like a garment, is its
clothing” ([Psa. 104.6](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#006.md)<span
id="ii.CIV-p16.1"></span>). Whose? Is it perchance God’s? But he had
already said of His clothing, “Clothed with light as with a
garment.” <span id="fr_4702"></span>[4703](#fn_4702.md) I hear of God
clothed in light, and that light, if we will, are we. What is, if we
will? if we are no longer darkness. Therefore if God is clothed with
light, whose clothing, again, is the deep? For an immense mass of waters
is called the deep. All water, all the moist nature, and the substance
everywhere shed abroad through the seas, and rivers, and hidden caves,
is all together called by one name, the Deep. Therefore we understand
the earth, of which he said, “He hath founded the earth.” Of it I
believe he said, “The deep, like a gar<span id="page_511">p. 511</span>
<span id="ii.CIV-Page_511"></span>ment is its clothing.” For the water
is as it were the clothing of the earth, surrounding it and covering
it.…

<span id="ii.CIV-p18"></span>6. “Above the mountains the waters shall
stand:” that is, the clothing of the earth, which is the deep, so
increased, that the waters stood even above the mountains. We read of
this taking place in the deluge.…The Prophet minding to foretell future
things, not to relate the past, therefore said it, because he would have
it understood that the Church should be in a deluge of persecutions. For
there was a time when the floods of persecutors had covered God’s earth,
God’s Church, and had so covered it, that not even those great ones
appeared, who are the mountains. For when they fled everywhere, how did
they but cease to appear? And perchance of those waters is that saying,
“Save me, O God, for the waters are come in even unto my soul.” <span
id="fr_4703"></span>[4704](#fn_4703.md) Especially the waters which make
the sea, stormy, unfruitful. For whatsoever earth the sea-water may have
covered, it will not rather make it fruitful than bring it to
barrenness. For there were also mountains beneath the waters, because
above the mountains waters stood. <span
id="fr_4704"></span>[4705](#fn_4704.md) …Why were the Apostles hidden by
flight? Because “above the mountains the waters stood.” <span
id="fr_4705"></span>[4706](#fn_4705.md) The power of the waters was great,
but how long? Hear what followeth.

<span id="ii.CIV-p22"></span>7. “From Thy rebuke they shall fly” ([Psa.
104.7](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#007)<span id="ii.CIV-p22.1"></span>.md).
And this was done, brethren; from God’s rebuke the waters did fly; that
is, they went back from pressing on the mountains. Now the mountains
themselves stand forth, Peter and Paul: how do they tower! They who
before were pressed down by persecutors, now are venerated by emperors.
For the waters are fled from the rebuke of God; because “the heart of
kings is in the hand of God, He hath bent it whither He would;” <span
id="fr_4706"></span>[4707](#fn_4706.md) He commanded peace to be given by
them to the Christians; the authority of the Apostles sprang up and
towered high.…The waters fled from the rebuke of God. “From the voice of
Thy thunder they shall be afraid.” Now who is there that would not be
afraid, from the voice of God through the Apostles, the voice of God
through the Scriptures, through His clouds? The sea is quieted, the
waters have been made afraid, the mountains have been laid bare, the
emperor hath given the order. But who would have given the order, unless
God had thundered? Because God willed, they commanded, and it was done.
Therefore let no one of men arrogate anything to himself.

<span id="ii.CIV-p24"></span>8. “The mountains ascend, and the plains go
down, into the place which Thou hast founded for them” ([Psa.
104.8](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#008)<span id="ii.CIV-p24.1"></span>.md).
He is still speaking of waters. Let us not here understand mountains as
of earth; nor plains, as of earth: but waves so great that they may be
compared to mountains. The sea did sometime toss, and its waves were as
mountains, which could cover those mountains the Apostles. But how long
do the mountains ascend and the plains go down? They raged, and they are
appeased. When they raged they were mountains: now they are appeased
they are become plains: for He hath founded a place for them. There is a
certain channel, <span id="fr_4707"></span>[4708](#fn_4707.md) as it were a
deep place, into which all those lately raging hearts of mortals have
retired.…They were mountains formerly, now they are plains: yet, my
brethren, even a dead calm <span id="fr_4708"></span>[4709](#fn_4708.md) is
sea. For wherefore are they not now violent? wherefore do they not rage?
Wherefore do they not try, if they cannot overthrow our earth, at least
to cover it? Wherefore not?

<span id="ii.CIV-p27"></span>9. Hear. “Thou hast set a bound which they
shall not pass over, neither shall they turn again to cover the earth”
([Psa. 104.9](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#009.md)<span
id="ii.CIV-p27.1"></span>). What then, because now the bitterest waves
have received a measure, that we must be allowed to preach such things
even with freedom; because they have had their due limit assigned,
because they cannot pass over the bound that is set, nor shall they
return to cover the earth; what is doing in the earth itself? What
workings take place therein, now that the sea hath left it bare?
Although at its beach slight waves do make their noise, although Pagans
still murmur round; the sound of the shores I hear, a deluge I dread
not. What then; what is doing in the earth? “Who sendeth out springs in
the little valleys” ([Psa. 104.10](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#010.md)<span
id="ii.CIV-p27.2"></span>). “Thou sendest out,” he saith, “springs in
the little valleys.” Ye know what little valleys are, lower places among
the lands. For to hills and mountains, valleys and little valleys are
opposed in contrary shape. Hills and mountains are swellings of the
land: but valleys and little valleys, lownesses of the lands. Do not
despise low places, thence flow springs. “Thou sendest out springs in
the little valleys.” Hear a mountain. The Apostle saith, “I laboured
more than they all.” A certain greatness is brought before us: yet
immediately, that the waters may flow, he hath made himself a valley:
“Yet not I, but the grace of God with me.” <span
id="fr_4709"></span>[4710](#fn_4709.md) It is no contradiction that they
who are mountains be also valleys: for as they are called mountains
because of their spiritual greatness, so also valleys because of the
humility of their spirit. “Not I,” he saith, “but the grace of God with
me.”…

<span id="ii.CIV-p29"></span>10. What is, “In the midst between the
mountains the waters shall pass through”? We have heard who are the
“mountains,” the great Preach<span id="page_512">p. 512</span> <span
id="ii.CIV-Page_512"></span>ers of the word, the exalted Angels of God,
though still in mortal flesh; lofty not by their own power, but by His
grace; but as far as relates to themselves, they are valleys, in their
humility they send forth springs. “In the midst,” he saith, “between the
mountains, the waters shall pass through.” Let us suppose this said
thus, “In the midst between the Apostles shall pass through the
preachings of the Word of Truth.” What is, in the midst between the
Apostles? What is called in the midst, is common. A common property,
from which all alike live, is in the midst, and belongs not to me, but
neither belongs it to thee, nor yet to me.…For if they are not in the
midst, they are as it were private, they flow not for public use, and I
have mine, and he has his own, it is not in the midst for both me and
him to have it; but such is not the preaching of peace.…Therefore,
brethren, let what we have said to your Love serve to this purpose,
because of the springs: that they may flow from you, be ye valleys, and
communicate with all that which ye have from God. Let the waters flow in
the midst, envy ye no one, drink, be filled, flow forth when ye are
filled. Everywhere let the common water of God have the glory, not the
private falsehoods of men.…

<span id="ii.CIV-p30"></span>11. For it follows, “All the beasts of the
wood shall drink” ([Psa. 104.11](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#011.md)<span
id="ii.CIV-p30.1"></span>). We do indeed see this also in the visible
creation, that the beasts of the wood drink of springs, and of streams
that run between the mountains: but now since it hath pleased God to
hide His own wisdom in the figures of such things, not to take it away
from earnest seekers, but to close it to them that care not, and open it
to them that knock; it hath also pleased our Lord God Himself to exhort
you by us to this, that in all these things which are said as if of the
bodily and visible creation, we may seek something spiritually hidden,
in which when found we may rejoice. The beasts of the wood, we
understand the Gentiles, and Holy Scripture witnesses this in many
places.…

<span id="ii.CIV-p31"></span>12. These beasts, then, drink those waters,
but passing; not staying, but passing; for all that teaching which in
all this time is dispensed passeth.…Unless perchance your love thinketh
that in that city to which it is said, “Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem,
praise thy God, O Sion; for He hath made strong the bars of thy
gates;” <span id="fr_4710"></span>[4711](#fn_4710.md) when the bars are now
strengthened and the city closed, whence, as we said some time
since, <span id="fr_4711"></span>[4712](#fn_4711.md) no friend goeth out,
no enemy entereth; <span id="fr_4712"></span>[4713](#fn_4712.md) that there
we shall have a book to read, or speech to be explained as it is now
explained to you. Therefore is it now treated, that there it may be held
fast: therefore is it now divided by syllables, that there it may be
contemplated whole and entire. The Word of God will not be wanting
there: but yet not by letters, not by sounds, not by books, <span
id="fr_4713"></span>[4714](#fn_4713.md) not by a reader, not by an
expositor. How then? As, “In the beginning was the Word,” etc. <span
id="fr_4714"></span>[4715](#fn_4714.md) For He did not so come to us as to
depart from thence; because He was in this world, and the world was made
by Him. Such a Word are we to contemplate. For “the God of gods shall
appear in Zion.” <span id="fr_4715"></span>[4716](#fn_4715.md) But this
when? After our pilgrimage, when the journey is done: if however after
our journey is done we be not delivered to the Judge, that the Judge may
send us to prison. But if when our journey is ended, as we hope, and
wish, and endeavour, we shall have reached our Country, there shall we
contemplate What we shall ever praise; nor shall That fail which is
present to us, nor we, who enjoy: nor shall he be cloyed that eateth,
nor shall that fail which he eateth. Great and wonderful shall be that
contemplation.…

<span id="ii.CIV-p38"></span>13. “The onagers shall take for their
thirst.” By onagers he meaneth some great beasts. For who knoweth not
that wild asses are called onagers? He meaneth, therefore, some great
untrained ones. For the Gentiles had no yoke of the Law: many nations
lived after their own customs, ranging in proud boastfulness as in a
wilderness. And so indeed did all the beasts, but the wild asses are put
to signify the greater sort. They too shall drink for their thirst, for
for them too the waters flow. Thence drinks the hare, thence the wild
ass: the hare little, the wild ass great; the hare timid, the wild ass
fierce: either sort drinks thence, but each for his thirst.…So
faithfully and gently doth it flow, as at once to satisfy the wild ass,
and not to alarm the hare. The sound of Tully’s voice rings out, Cicero
is read, it is some book, it is a dialogue of his, whether his own, or
Plato’s, or by whatever such writer: some hear that are unlearned, weak
ones of less mind; who dareth to aspire to such a thing? It is a sound
of water, and that perchance turbid, but certainly flowing so violently,
that a timid animal dare not draw near and drink. To whom soundeth a
Psalm, and he saith, It is too much for me? Behold now what the Psalm
soundeth; certainly they are hidden mysteries, yet so it soundeth, that
even children are delighted to hear, and the <span id="page_513">p.
513</span> <span id="ii.CIV-Page_513"></span>unlearned come to drink,
and when filled burst forth in singing.…

<span id="ii.CIV-p39"></span>14. Then the Psalm goes on in its text,
“Upon them <span id="fr_4716"></span>[4717](#fn_4716.md) the fowls of the
heaven shall inhabit” ([Psa.
104.12](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#012.md)<span
id="ii.CIV-p40.1"></span>).…Upon the mountains, then, the fowls of the
air shall have their habitation. We see these birds dwell upon the
mountains, but many of them dwell in plains, many in valleys, many in
groves, many in gardens, not all upon mountains. There are some fowls
that dwell not save on the mountains. Some spiritual souls doth this
name denote. Fowls are spiritual hearts, which enjoy the free air. In
the clearness of heaven these birds delight, yet their feeding is on the
mountains, there will they dwell. Ye know the mountains, they have been
already treated of. Mountains are Prophets, mountains are Apostles,
mountains are all preachers of the truth.…

<span id="ii.CIV-p41"></span>15. But think not that those “fowls of
heaven” follow their own authority; see what the Psalm saith: “From the
midst of the rocks they shall give their voice.” Now, if I shall say to
you, Believe, for this said Cicero, this said Plato, this said
Pythagoras: which of you will not laugh at me? For I shall be a bird
that shall send forth my voice not from the rock. What ought each one of
you to say to me? what ought he who is thus instructed to say? “If any
one shall have preached unto you a gospel other than that ye have
received, let him be anathema.” <span
id="fr_4717"></span>[4718](#fn_4717.md) What dost thou tell me of Plato,
and of Cicero, and of Virgil? Thou hast before thee the rocks of the
mountains, from the midst of the rocks give me thy voice. Let them be
heard, who hear from the rock: let them be heard, because also in those
many rocks the One Rock is heard: for “the Rock was Christ.” <span
id="fr_4718"></span>[4719](#fn_4718.md) Let them therefore be willingly
heard, giving their voice from the midst of the rocks. Nothing is
sweeter than such a voice of birds. They sound, and the rocks resound:
they sound; spiritual men discuss: the rocks resound, testimonies of
Scripture give answer. Lo! thence the fowls give their voice from the
midst of the rocks, for they dwell on the mountains.

<span id="ii.CIV-p44"></span>16. “Watering the mountains from the higher
places” ([Psa. 104.13](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#013.md)<span
id="ii.CIV-p44.1"></span>). Now if a Gentile uncircumcised man comes to
us, about to believe in Christ, we give him baptism, and do not call him
back to those works of the Law. And if a Jew asks us why we do that, we
sound from the rock, we say, This Peter did, this Paul did: from the
midst of the rocks we give our voice. But that rock, Peter himself, that
great mountain, when he prayed and saw that vision, was watered from
above.…

<span id="ii.CIV-p45"></span>17. “From the fruit of Thy works shall the
earth be satisfied.” What is, “From the fruit of Thy works”? Let no man
glory in his own works: but “he that glorieth, let him glory in the
Lord.” <span id="fr_4719"></span>[4720](#fn_4719.md) With Thy grace he is
satisfied, when he is satisfied: let him not say that grace was given
for his own merits. If it is called grace, “it is gratuitously given;”
if it is returned for works, wages are paid. <span
id="fr_4720"></span>[4721](#fn_4720.md) Freely therefore receive, because
ungodly thou art justified.

<span id="ii.CIV-p48"></span>18. “Bringing forth grass for the cattle,
and green herb for the service of men” ([Psa.
104.14](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#014.md)<span
id="ii.CIV-p48.1"></span>). This is true, I perceive; I recognise the
creation: the earth doth bring forth grass for the cattle, and green
herb for the service of men. But I perceive the words, “Thou shalt not
muzzle the mouth of the ox which treadeth out the corn: Doth God take
care for oxen? For our sakes therefore the Scripture saith it.”  <span
id="fr_4721"></span>[4722](#fn_4721.md) How then doth the earth bring forth
grass for the cattle? Because “the Lord hath ordained that they which
preach the Gospel should live of the Gospel.” He sent preachers, saying
unto them, “Eat such things as are set before you of them: for the
labourer is worthy of his hire.” <span
id="fr_4722"></span>[4723](#fn_4722.md) …They give spiritual, they receive
carnal things; they give gold, they receive grass.…“If we have sown unto
you spiritual things, is it a great matter if we shall reap your carnal
things?” <span id="fr_4723"></span>[4724](#fn_4723.md) This the Apostle
said, a preacher so laborious, so indefatigable, so well tried, that he
giveth this very grass to the earth. “Nevertheless,” he saith, “we have
not used this power.” He showeth that it is due to him, yet he received
it not; nor hath he condemned those who have received what was due. For
those were to be condemned who exact what is not due, not they who
accept their recompense: yet he gave up even his own recompense. Thou
dost not cease to owe to another, because one hath given up his dues,
otherwise thou wilt not be the watered earth which bringeth forth grass
for the cattle.…Thou receivest spiritual things, give carnal things in
return: to the soldier they are due, to the soldier thou returnest them;
thou art the paymaster <span id="fr_4724"></span>[4725](#fn_4724.md) of
Christ. “Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth a
vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a flock,
and eateth not of the milk of the flock? I speak not thus, that it
should be so done unto me.” <span id="fr_4725"></span>[4726](#fn_4725.md)
There has been such a soldier as gave up his rations of food even to the
paymaster: yet let the paymaster pay the rations.…

<span id="ii.CIV-p54"></span>19. “That it may bring forth bread out of
the earth.” What bread? Christ. Out of what earth? From Peter, from
Paul, from the other <span id="page_514">p. 514</span> <span
id="ii.CIV-Page_514"></span>stewards of the truth. Hear that it is from
the earth: “We have,” saith St. Paul, “this treasure in earthen vessels,
that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.” <span
id="fr_4726"></span>[4727](#fn_4726.md) He is the bread who descended from
heaven, <span id="fr_4727"></span>[4728](#fn_4727.md) that He might be
brought forth out of the earth, when He is preached through the flesh of
His servants. The earth bringeth forth grass, that it may bring forth
bread from the earth. What earth bringeth forth grass? Pious, holy
nations. That bread may be brought forth out of what earth? The word of
God out of the Apostles, out of the stewards of God’s Sacraments, who
still walk upon the earth, who still carry an earthly body.

<span id="ii.CIV-p57"></span>20. “And wine maketh glad the heart of man”
([Psa. 104.15](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#015.md)<span
id="ii.CIV-p57.1"></span>). Let no man prepare himself for intoxication;
nay, let every man prepare him for intoxication. “How excellent is Thy
cup which maketh inebriate!” <span id="fr_4728"></span>[4729](#fn_4728.md)
We choose not to say, Let no man be drunk. Be inebriated; yet beware,
from what source. If the excellent cup of the Lord doth saturate you,
your ebriety shall be seen in your works, it shall be seen in the holy
love of righteousness, it shall, lastly, be seen in the estrangement of
your mind, but from things earthly to heavenly. “To make him a cheerful
countenance with oil.”…What is the making the countenance cheerful with
oil? The grace of God; a sort of shining for manifestation; as the
Apostle saith, “The Spirit is given to every man for
manifestation.” <span id="fr_4729"></span>[4730](#fn_4729.md) A certain
grace which men can clearly see in men, to conciliate holy love, is
termed oil, for its divine splendour; and since it appeared most
excellent in Christ, the whole world loveth Him; who though while here
He was scorned, is now worshipped by every nation: “For the kingdom is
the Lord’s, and He shall be Governor among the people.” <span
id="fr_4730"></span>[4731](#fn_4730.md) For such is His grace, that many,
who do not believe on Him, praise Him, and declare that they are
unwilling to believe on Him, because no man can fulfil what He doth
command. They who with reproaches once raged against Him, are hindered
by His very praises. Yet by all is He loved, by all is He preached;
because He is excellently anointed, therefore He is Christ: for He is
called Christ from the Chrism or anointing which He had. Messiah in the
Hebrew, Christ in the Greek, Unctus in the Latin: but He anointeth over
His whole Body. All therefore who come, receive grace, that their
countenances may be made glad with oil.

<span id="ii.CIV-p61"></span>21. “And bread strengtheneth man’s heart.”
What is this, brethren? As it were, he hath forced us to understand what
bread he was speaking of. For while that visible bread strengtheneth the
stomach, feedeth the body, there is another bread which strengtheneth
the heart, in that it is the bread of the heart.…There is therefore a
wine that truly maketh glad the heart, and knoweth not to do aught else
than to gladden the heart. But that thou mayest not imagine that this
indeed should be taken of the spiritual wine, but not of that spiritual
bread; He hath shown this very point, that it is also spiritual: “and
bread,” he saith, “strengtheneth man’s heart.” So understand it
therefore of the bread as thou dost understand it of the wine; hunger
inwardly, thirst inwardly: “Blessed are they,” saith our Lord, “who
hunger and thirst after righteousness; for they shall be filled.” <span
id="fr_4731"></span>[4732](#fn_4731.md) That bread is righteousness, that
wine is righteousness: it is truth, Christ is truth. <span
id="fr_4732"></span>[4733](#fn_4732.md) “I am,” He said, “the living bread,
who came down from heaven;” <span id="fr_4733"></span>[4734](#fn_4733.md)
and, “I am the Vine, and ye are the branches.” <span
id="fr_4734"></span>[4735](#fn_4734.md)

<span id="ii.CIV-p66"></span>22. “The trees of the plain shall be
satisfied” ([Psa. 104.16](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#016.md)<span
id="ii.CIV-p66.1"></span>): but with this grace, brought forth out of
the earth. “The trees of the plain,” are the lower orders of the
nations. “And the cedars of Libanus which He hath planted.” The cedars
of Libanus, the powerful in the world, shall themselves be filled. The
bread, and wine, and oil of Christ hath reached senators, nobles, kings;
the trees of the plain are filled. First the humble are filled; next
also the cedars of Libanus, yet those which He hath planted; pious
cedars, religious faithful; for such hath He planted. For the ungodly
also are cedars of Libanus; for, “The Lord shall break the cedars of
Libanus.” <span id="fr_4735"></span>[4736](#fn_4735.md) For Libanus is a
mountain: there are those trees, even according to the letter most
long-lived and most excellent. But Libanus is interpreted, as we read in
those who have written of these things, a brightness: and this
brightness seemeth to belong to this world, which at present shineth and
is refulgent with its pomps. There are the cedars of Libanus, which the
Lord hath planted; those which the Lord hath planted shall be filled.…

<span id="ii.CIV-p68"></span>23. “There shall the sparrows build their
nests: their leader is the house of the coot” ([Psa.
104.17](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#017.md)<span
id="ii.CIV-p68.1"></span>). Where shall the sparrows build? In the
cedars of Libanus.…Who are the sparrows? Sparrows are birds indeed, and
fowls of the air, but small fowls are wont to be called sparrows. There
are therefore some spiritual ones that build in the cedars of Libanus:
that is, there are certain servants of God who hear in the Gospel, “Sell
all that thou hast, and give to the poor; and thou shalt have treasure
in heaven; and come and follow Me.” <span
id="fr_4736"></span>[4737](#fn_4736.md) …Let him who hath resigned many
things, not be <span id="page_515">p. 515</span> <span
id="ii.CIV-Page_515"></span>proud. We know that Peter was a fisherman:
what then could he give up, to follow our Lord? Or his brother Andrew,
or John and James the sons of Zebedee, themselves also fishermen; <span
id="fr_4737"></span>[4738](#fn_4737.md) and yet what did they say? “Behold,
we have forsaken all, and followed Thee.” <span
id="fr_4738"></span>[4739](#fn_4738.md) Our Lord said not to him, Thou hast
forgotten thy poverty; what hast thou resigned, that thou shouldest
receive the whole world? He, my brethren, who resigned not only what he
had, but also what he longed to have, resigned much.…

<span id="ii.CIV-p72"></span>24. But although the sparrows will build in
the cedars of Libanus, “the house of the coot is their leader.” What is
the house of the coot? The coot, as we all know, is a water bird,
dwelling either among the marshes, or on the sea. It hath rarely or
never a home on the shore; but in places in the midst of the waters, and
thus usually in rocky islets, surrounded by the waves. We therefore
understand that the rock is the fit home of the coot, it never dwelleth
more securely than on the rock. On what sort of rock? One placed in the
sea. And if it is beaten by the waves, yet it breaketh the waves, is not
broken by them: this is the excellency of the rock in the sea. How great
waves beat on our Lord Jesus Christ? The Jews dashed against Him; they
were broken, He remained whole. And let every one who doth imitate
Christ, so dwell in this world, that is, in this sea, where he cannot
but feel storms and tempests, that he may yield to no wind, to no wave,
but remain whole, while he meets them all. The home of the coot,
therefore, is both strong and weak. The coot hath not a home on lofty
spots; nothing is more firm and nothing more humble than that home.
Sparrows build indeed in cedars, on account of actual need: but they
hold that rock as their leader, which is beaten by the waves, and yet
not broken; for they imitate the sufferings of Christ.…

<span id="ii.CIV-p73"></span>25. What then followeth? “The loftiest
hills are for the stags” ([Psa.
104.18](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#018.md)<span
id="ii.CIV-p73.1"></span>). The stags are mighty, spiritual, passing in
their course over all the thorny places of the thickets and woods. “He
maketh my feet like harts’ feet, and setteth me up on high.” <span
id="fr_4739"></span>[4740](#fn_4739.md) Let them hold to the lofty hills,
the lofty commandments of God; let them think on sublime subjects, let
them hold those which stand forth most in the Scriptures, let them be
justified in the highest: for those loftiest hills are for the stags.
What of the humble beasts? what of the hare? what of the hedgehog? The
hare is a small and weak animal: the hedgehog is also prickly: the one
is a timid animal, the other is covered with prickles. What do the
prickles signify, except sinners? He who sinneth daily, although not
great sins, is covered over with the smallest prickles. In his timidity
he is a hare: in his being covered with the minutest sins, he is a
hedgehog: and he cannot hold those lofty and perfect commandments. For
“the loftiest hills are for the stags.” What then? do these perish? No.
For so “is the rock the refuge for the hedgehogs and the hares.” <span
id="fr_4740"></span>[4741](#fn_4740.md) For the Lord is a refuge for the
poor. Place that rock upon the land, it is a refuge for hedgehogs, and
for hares: place it on the sea, it is the home of the coot. Everywhere
the rock is useful. Even in the hills it is useful: for the hills
without the rock’s foundation would fall into the deep.…

<span id="ii.CIV-p76"></span>26. “He appointed the Moon for certain
seasons” ([Psa. 104.19](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#019.md)<span
id="ii.CIV-p76.1"></span>). We understand spiritually the Church
increasing from the smallest size, and growing old as it were from the
mortality of this life; yet so, that it draweth nearer unto the Sun. I
speak not of this moon visible to the eye, but of that which is
signified by this name. While the Church was in the dark, while she as
yet appeared not, shone not forth as yet, men were led astray, and it
was said, This is the Church, here is Christ; so that “while the Moon
was dark, they shot their arrows at the righteous in heart.” <span
id="fr_4741"></span>[4742](#fn_4741.md) How blind is he who now, when the
Moon is full, wandereth astray? “He appointed the Moon for certain
seasons.” For here the Church temporarily is passing away: for this
subjection to death will not remain for ever: there will some time be an
end of waxing and waning; it is appointed for certain seasons. “And the
sun knoweth his going down.” And what sun is this, but that Sun of
righteousness, whom the ungodly will lament on the day of judgment never
having risen for them; they who will say on that day, “Therefore we
wandered from the way of truth, and the light of righteousness shone not
on us, and the sun did not arise upon us.” <span
id="fr_4742"></span>[4743](#fn_4742.md) That sun riseth for him who
understandeth Christ.…

<span id="ii.CIV-p79"></span>27. Nor think, brethren, that the sun ought
to be worshipped by some men, because the sun doth sometimes in the
Scriptures signify Christ. For such is the madness of men; <span
id="fr_4743"></span>[4744](#fn_4743.md) as if we said that a creature
should be worshipped, when it is said, the sun is an emblem of Christ.
Then worship the rock also, for it also is a type of Christ. <span
id="fr_4744"></span>[4745](#fn_4744.md) “He was brought as a lamb to the
slaughter:” <span id="fr_4745"></span>[4746](#fn_4745.md) worship the lamb
also, since it is a type of Christ. “The Lion of the tribe of Judah hath
prevailed;” <span id="fr_4746"></span>[4747](#fn_4746.md) worship the lion
also, since it signifieth Christ. Observe how numerous are the types of
Christ: all these are Christ in similitude, not in essence.…

<span id="ii.CIV-p84"></span><span id="page_516">p. 516</span> <span
id="ii.CIV-Page_516"></span>28. What then, when the sun went down, when
our Lord suffered? There was a sort of darkness with the Apostles, hope
failed, in those to whom He at first seemed great, and the Redeemer of
all men. How so? “Thou didst make darkness, and it became night; wherein
all the beasts of the forest shall move” ([Psa.
104.20](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#020.md)<span
id="ii.CIV-p84.1"></span>).…Here the beasts of the forest are used in
different ways: for these things are always understood in varying
senses; as our Lord Himself is at one time termed a lion, at another a
lamb. What is so different as a lion and a lamb? But what sort of lamb?
One that could overcome the wolf, overcome the lion. He is the Rock, He
the Shepherd, He the Gate. The Shepherd entereth by the gate: and He
saith, “I am the good Shepherd:” and, “I am the Door of the
Sheep.” <span id="fr_4747"></span>[4748](#fn_4747.md) …Learn thus to
understand, when these things are spoken figuratively; lest perchance
when ye have read that the Rock signifieth Christ, <span
id="fr_4748"></span>[4749](#fn_4748.md) ye may understand it to mean Him in
every passage. In one place it meaneth one thing, another in another,
just as we can only understand the meaning of a letter by seeing its
position. <span id="fr_4749"></span>[4750](#fn_4749.md) “The lion’s whelps
roaring after their prey, do seek their meat from God” ([Psa.
104.21](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#021.md)<span
id="ii.CIV-p87.1"></span>). Justly then our Lord, when nigh unto His
going down, the very Sun of Righteousness recognising His going down,
said to His disciples, as if darkness being about to come, the lion
would roam about to seek whom he might devour, that that lion could
devour no man, unless with leave: “Simon,” said He, “this night Satan
hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat. But I have
prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not.”  <span
id="fr_4750"></span>[4751](#fn_4750.md) When Peter thrice denied, <span
id="fr_4751"></span>[4752](#fn_4751.md) was he not already between the
lion’s teeth?…

<span id="ii.CIV-p90"></span>29. “The Sun hath arisen, and they get them
away together, and lay them down in their dens” ([Psa.
104.22](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#022.md)<span
id="ii.CIV-p90.1"></span>). More and more as the Sun riseth, so that
Christ is recognised by the round world, and glorified therein, do the
lion’s whelps get them away together; those devils recede from the
persecution of the Church, who instigated men to persecute the house of
God, by working in the sons of unbelief.  <span
id="fr_4752"></span>[4753](#fn_4752.md) Now that none of them dareth
persecute the Church, “the Sun hath arisen, and they get them away
together.” And where are they? “And they lay them down in their dens.”
Their dens are the hearts of the unbelieving. How many carry lions
crouching in their hearts? They burst not forth thence, they make no
assault upon the pilgrim Jerusalem. Wherefore do they not so? Because
the Sun is already risen, and is shining over the whole world.

<span id="ii.CIV-p92"></span>30. What art thou doing, O man of God?
thou, O Church of God? what art thou, O body of Christ, whose Head is in
Heaven? what art thou doing, O man, His unity? “Man,” he saith, “shall
go forth to his work” ([Psa.
104.23](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#023.md)<span
id="ii.CIV-p92.1"></span>). Let therefore this man work good works in
the security of the peace of the Church, let him work unto the end. For
sometime there will be a sort of general darkening, and a sort of
assault will be made, but in the evening, that is, in the end of the
world: but now the Church doth work in peace and tranquillity; for “man
shall go forth to his work, and to his labour, unto the evening.”

<span id="ii.CIV-p93"></span>31. “O Lord, how great are made Thy works!”
([Psa. 104.24](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#024.md)<span
id="ii.CIV-p93.1"></span>). Justly great, justly sublime! where were
those works made, that are so great? what was that station where God
stood, or that seat whereupon He sat, when He did those works? what was
the place where He worked thus? whence did those so beautiful works
proceed at the first? To take it word for word, every ordained creation,
running by ordinance, beautiful by ordinance, rising by ordinance,
setting by ordinance, going through all seasons by ordinance, whence
hath it proceeded? whence hath the Church herself received her rise, her
growth, her perfection? In what manner is she destined to a consummation
in immortality? with what heralding is she preached? by what mysteries
is she recommended? by what types is she concealed? by what preaching is
she revealed? where hath God done these things? I see great works. “How
great are made Thy works, O Lord!” I ask where He hath made them: I find
not the place: but I see what followeth: “In Wisdom hast Thou made them
all.” All therefore Thou hast made in Christ.…“The earth is full of Thy
creation.” The earth is full of the creation of Christ. And how so? We
discern how: for what was not made by the Father through the Son?
Whatever walketh and doth crawl on earth, whatever doth swim in the
waters, whatever flieth in the air, whatever doth revolve in heaven, how
much more then the earth, the whole universe, is the work of God. But he
seems to me to speak here of some new creation, of which the Apostle
saith, “If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things have
passed away; behold, all things are become new. And all things are of
God.” <span id="fr_4753"></span>[4754](#fn_4753.md) All who <span
id="page_517">p. 517</span> <span id="ii.CIV-Page_517"></span>believe in
Christ, who put off the old man, and put on the new, <span
id="fr_4754"></span>[4755](#fn_4754.md) are a new creature. “The earth is
full of Thy works.” On one spot of the earth He was crucified, in one
small spot that seed fell into the earth, and died; but brought forth
great fruit.…

<span id="ii.CIV-p96"></span>32. “The earth is full of Thy creation.” Of
what creation of Thine is the earth full? Of all trees and shrubs, of
all animals and flocks, and of the whole of the human race; the earth is
full of the creation of God. We see, know, read, recognise, praise, and
in these we preach of Him; yet we are not able to praise respecting
these things, as fully as our heart doth abound with praise after the
beautiful contemplation of them. But we ought rather to heed that
creation, of which the Apostle saith, “If any man be in Christ, he is a
new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become
new.” <span id="fr_4755"></span>[4756](#fn_4755.md) What “old things have
passed away”? In the Gentiles, all idolatry; in the Jews themselves, all
that servitude unto the Law, all those sacrifices that were harbingers
of the present Sacrifice. The oldness of man was then abundant; One came
to renovate His own work, to melt His silver, to form His coin, and we
now see the earth full of Christians believing in God, turning
themselves away from their former uncleanness and idolatry, from a past
hope to the hope of a new age: and behold it is not yet realized, but is
already possessed in hope, and through that very hope we now sing, and
say, “The earth is full of Thy creation.” We do not as yet sing this in
our country, nor yet in that rest which is promised, the bars of the
gates of Jerusalem not being as yet made fast; <span
id="fr_4756"></span>[4757](#fn_4756.md) but still in our pilgrimage gazing
upon the whole of this world, upon men who on every side are running
unto the faith, fearing hell, despising death, loving eternal life,
scorning the present, and filled with joy at such a spectacle, we say,
“The earth is full of Thy creation.”

<span id="ii.CIV-p99"></span>33. …“So is the great and wide sea also;
wherein are things creeping innumerable, both small and great beasts”
([Psa. 104.25](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#025.md)<span
id="ii.CIV-p99.1"></span>). He speaketh of the sea as terrible. Snares
creep in this world, and surprise the careless suddenly; for who
numbereth the temptations that creep? They creep, but beware, lest they
snatch us away. Let us keep watch on the Wood; even in the water, <span
id="fr_4757"></span>[4758](#fn_4757.md) even on the waves, we are safe: let
not Christ sleep, let not faith sleep; if He hath slept, let Him be
awakened; He will command the winds; He will calm the sea; <span
id="fr_4758"></span>[4759](#fn_4758.md) the voyage will be ended, and we
shall rejoice in our country. For I see in this terrible sea unbelievers
still; for they dwell in barren and bitter waters: but they are both
small and great. We know this: many little men of this world are still
unbelievers, many great men of this world are so: there are living
creatures, both small and great, in this sea. They hate the Church: the
name of Christ is a burden to them: they rage not, because they are not
permitted; the cruelty which cannot burst forth in deeds, is shut up
within the heart. For all, whether small or great, “creeping things,
both small and great,” who at present grieve at the temples being shut,
the altars overthrown, the images broken, the laws which make it a
capital crime to sacrifice to idols; all who mourn on this account, are
still in the sea. What then of us? And by what road then are we to
journey unto our country? Through this very sea, but on the Wood. Fear
not the danger; that wood which holdeth together the world doth bear
thee up.

<span id="ii.CIV-p102"></span>34. “There shall go the ships” ([Psa.
104.26](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#026.md)<span
id="ii.CIV-p102.1"></span>). Lo, ships float upon that which alarmed
you, and sink not. By ships we understand churches; they go among the
storms, among the tempests of temptations, among the waves of the world,
among the beasts, both small and great. Christ on the wood of His cross
is the Pilot. “There shall go the ships.” Let not the ships fear, let
them not much mind where they float, but by Whom they are steered.
“There shall go the ships.” What voyage do they find tedious, when they
feel that Christ is their Pilot? They will sail safely, let them sail
diligently, they will reach their promised haven, they will be led to
the land of rest.

<span id="ii.CIV-p103"></span>35. There is also in that sea somewhat
which transcends all creatures, great and small. What is this? Let us
hear the Psalm: “There is that Leviathan, whom Thou hast formed to make
sport of him.” There are creeping things innumerable, both small and
great beasts; there shall the ships go, and shall not fear, not only the
creeping things innumerable, and beasts both small and great, but not
even the serpent which is there; “whom Thou,” he speaketh unto God,
“hast made to make sport of him.” This is a great mystery; and yet I am
about to utter what ye already know. Ye know that a certain serpent is
the enemy of the Church: ye have not seen him with the eyes of the
flesh, but ye see him with the eyes of faith.…

<span id="ii.CIV-p104"></span>36. This serpent then, our ancient enemy,
glowing with rage, cunning in his wiles, is in the mighty sea. “Here is
that Leviathan, whom Thou hast formed to make sport of him.” Do thou now
make sport of the serpent: for for this end was this serpent made. He
falling by his own sin from the sublime realms of the heavens, and made
devil instead of angel, received a certain region of his own in this
<span id="page_518">p. 518</span> <span
id="ii.CIV-Page_518"></span>mighty and spacious sea. What thou thinkest
his kingdom, is his prison. For many say: wherefore hath the devil
received so great power, that he may rule in this world, and prevaileth
so much, can do so much? How much prevaileth he? How much can he do?
Unless by permission, he can do nothing. Do thou so act, that he may not
be allowed to attack thee; or if he be allowed to tempt thee, he may
depart vanquished, and may not gain thee. For he hath been allowed to
tempt some holy men, servants of God: they overcame him, because they
departed not from the way, they whose heel he watched, fell not.…

<span id="ii.CIV-p105"></span>37. He then, my brethren, who doth wish to
watch the serpent’s head, and safely to pass this sea; for it must be
that this serpent dwelleth here, and, as I had commenced saying, the
devil when he fell from heaven received this region; let him watch his
head, on the part of the fear of the world, and of the lusts of the
world. For it is hence that he suggesteth some object of fear or of
desire; he trieth thy love, or thy fear. If thou fearest hell, and
lovest the kingdom of God, thou wilt watch his head.…“There is no power
but of God.” <span id="fr_4759"></span>[4760](#fn_4759.md) What then
fearest thou? Let the dragon be in the waters, let the dragon be in the
sea: thou art to pass through it. He is made so as to be made sport of,
he is ordained to inhabit this place, this region is given him. Thou
thinkest that this habitation is a great thing for him, because thou
knowest not the dwellings of the angels whence he fell: <span
id="fr_4760"></span>[4761](#fn_4760.md) what seemeth to thee his glory, is
his damnation.

<span id="ii.CIV-p108"></span>38. …What then fearest thou? Perhaps he is
about to try thy flesh: it is the scourge of thy Lord, not the power of
thy tempter. His wish is to injure that salvation which is promised: but
he is not allowed: but that he may not be allowed, have Christ for thy
Head: repel the serpent’s head: consent not unto his suggestion, slip
not from thy path. “There is that Leviathan, whom Thou hast made to make
sport of him.”

<span id="ii.CIV-p109"></span>39. Dost thou wish to see how incapable he
is of hurting thee, unless permitted? “These,” he saith, “wait all upon
Thee, that Thou mayest give them meat in due season” ([Psa.
104.27](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#027.md)<span
id="ii.CIV-p109.1"></span>). And this serpent wisheth to devour, but he
devoureth not whom he wisheth.…Thou hast heard what the serpent’s meat
is. Thou dost not wish that God give thee to be devoured by the serpent;
because not the serpent’s food: i.e. forsake not the Word of God. For
where it is said to the serpent, “Dust thou shalt eat,” it is said to
the transgressor, “Dust thou art, and unto dust thou shalt
return.” <span id="fr_4761"></span>[4762](#fn_4761.md) Thou dost not wish
to be the serpent’s food? be not dust. How, thou repliest, shall I not
be dust? If thou hast not a taste for earthly things. Hear the Apostle,
that thou mayest not be dust. For the body which thou wearest is earth:
but do thou refuse to be earth. What meaneth this? “Set your affection
on things above, not on things on the earth.” <span
id="fr_4762"></span>[4763](#fn_4762.md) If thou dost not set thy affections
on earthly things, thou art not earth: if thou art not earth, thou art
not devoured by the serpent, whose appointed food is earth. The Lord
giveth the serpent his food when He will, what He will: but He judgeth
rightly, he cannot be deceived, He giveth him not gold for earth. “When
Thou hast given it them, they gather it.”…

<span id="ii.CIV-p112"></span>40. “When thou openest Thy hand, they
shall all be filled with good” ([Psa.
104.28](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#028.md)<span
id="ii.CIV-p112.1"></span>). What is it, O Lord, that Thou openest Thy
hand? Christ is Thy hand. “To whom is the arm of the Lord
revealed?” <span id="fr_4763"></span>[4764](#fn_4763.md) To whom it is
revealed, unto him it is opened: for revelation is opening. “When Thou
openest Thy hand, they shall all be filled with good.” When Thou
revealest Thy Christ, “they shall all be filled with good.” But they
have not good from themselves; this is oftentimes proved unto them.
“When Thou hidest Thy face, they are troubled” ([Psa.
104.29](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#029.md)<span
id="ii.CIV-p113.2"></span>). Many filled with good have attributed to
themselves what they had, and have wished to boast as in their own
righteousnesses, and have said to themselves, I am righteous; I am
great: and have become self-complacent. Unto these the Apostle speaketh:
“What hast thou, that thou didst not receive?” <span
id="fr_4764"></span>[4765](#fn_4764.md) But God, wishing to prove unto man
that whatever he hath he hath from Him, so that with good he may gain
humility also, sometimes troubleth him; He turneth away His face from
him, and he falleth into temptation; and He showeth him that his
righteousness, and his walking aright, was only under His government.…

<span id="ii.CIV-p115"></span>41. But wherefore dost Thou do this?
wherefore dost Thou hide Thy face, that they may be troubled? “Thou
shalt take away their breath, and they shall fail.” Their breath was
their pride; they boast, they attribute things to themselves, they
justify themselves. Hide, therefore, Thy face, that they may be
troubled: take away their breath, and let them fail; let them cry unto
Thee, “Hear me, O Lord, and that soon, for my spirit waxeth faint: hide
not Thy face from me.” <span id="fr_4765"></span>[4766](#fn_4765.md) “Thou
shalt take away their breath, and they shall fail, and shall be turned
to their dust.” The man who repenteth of his sin discovereth himself,
that he had not strength of himself; and doth confess unto God, saying,
that he is earth and ashes. O proud one, thou <span id="page_519">p.
519</span> <span id="ii.CIV-Page_519"></span>art turned to thine own
dust, thy breath hath been taken away; no longer dost thou boast
thyself, no longer extol thyself, no longer justify thyself; thou seest
that thou art made of dust, and when the Lord turneth away His face,
thou hast fallen back into thine own dust. Pray, therefore, confess thy
dust and thy weakness.

<span id="ii.CIV-p117"></span>42. And see what followeth: “Thou shalt
send forth Thy Spirit, <span id="fr_4766"></span>[4767](#fn_4766.md) and
they shall be made” ([Psa. 104.30](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#030.md)<span
id="ii.CIV-p118.1"></span>). Thou shalt take away their spirit, and send
forth Thine own: Thou shalt take away their spirit: they shall have no
spirit of their own. Are they then forsaken? “Blessed are the poor in
spirit:” <span id="fr_4767"></span>[4768](#fn_4767.md) but they are not
forsaken. They refused to have a spirit of their own: they shall have
the Spirit of God. Such were our Lord’s words to the future
martyrs: <span id="fr_4768"></span>[4769](#fn_4768.md) “It is not ye that
speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you.” Attribute
not your courage to yourselves. If it is yours, He saith, and not Mine,
it is obstinacy, not courage. “For we are His workmanship,” saith the
Apostle, “created unto good works.” <span
id="fr_4769"></span>[4770](#fn_4769.md) From His Spirit we have received
grace, that we may live unto righteousness: for it is He that justifieth
the ungodly. <span id="fr_4770"></span>[4771](#fn_4770.md) “Thou shalt take
away their spirit, and they shall fail; Thou shalt send forth Thy
Spirit, and they shall be made: and Thou shalt renew the face of the
earth:” that is, with new men, confessing themselves to have been
justified, not righteous of their own power, so that the grace of God is
in them. What then? When He hath taken away our spirit, we shall be
turned again to our dust, beholding to our edification our weakness,
that when we receive His Spirit we may be refreshed. See what followeth:
“Be the glory of the Lord for ever” ([Psa.
104.31](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#031.md)<span
id="ii.CIV-p122.2"></span>). Not thine, not mine, not his, or his; not
for a season, but “for ever.” “The Lord shall rejoice in His works.” Not
in thine, as if they were thine: because if thy works are evil, it is
through thy iniquity; if good, it is through the grace of God. “The Lord
shall rejoice in His works.”

<span id="ii.CIV-p123"></span>43. “Who looketh on the earth, and maketh
it tremble; who toucheth the hills, and they shall smoke” ([Psa.
104.32](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#032.md)<span
id="ii.CIV-p123.1"></span>). O earth, thou wast exulting in thy good, to
thyself thou didst ascribe thy fulness and opulence; behold, the Lord
looketh on thee, and causeth thee to tremble. May He look on thee, and
make thee tremble: for the trembling of humility is better than the
confidence of pride.…For it is God, he saith, which worketh in you. For
this reason then with trembling, because God worketh in you. Because He
gave, because what thou hast cometh not from thee, thou shalt work with
fear and trembling, for if thou fearest not Him, He will take away what
He gave. Work, therefore, with trembling. Hear another Psalm: “Serve the
Lord with fear, and rejoice unto Him with trembling.” <span
id="fr_4771"></span>[4772](#fn_4771.md) If we must rejoice with trembling,
God beholdeth us, there cometh an earthquake; when God looketh upon us,
let our hearts tremble; then will God rest there. Hear Him in another
passage: “Upon whom shall My Spirit rest? Even on him that is lowly and
quiet, and who trembleth at My Word.” <span
id="fr_4772"></span>[4773](#fn_4772.md)

<span id="ii.CIV-p126"></span>“Who looketh on the earth, and maketh it
tremble; who toucheth the hills, and they shall smoke” ([Psa.
104.32](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#032.md)<span
id="ii.CIV-p126.1"></span>). The hills were proud, and boastful of
themselves, God had not touched them: He toucheth them, and they shall
smoke. What meaneth the smoking of the hills? That they pray unto the
Lord. Behold great hills, proud hills, vast hills, prayed not to God:
they wished themselves to be entreated, and entreated not Him who was
above them. For what powerful, arrogant, proud man is there upon the
earth, who deigneth humbly to entreat God? I speak of the ungodly, not
of the “cedars of Libanus, which the Lord hath planted.” Every ungodly
man, unhappy soul, knoweth not how to entreat God, while he wisheth
himself to be entreated by men. He is a hill; it is needful that God
touch him, that he may smoke: when he hath begun to smoke, he will offer
prayers unto God, as it were the sacrifice of his heart. He smoketh unto
God, he then beateth his breast: he beginneth to weep, for smoke doth
elicit tears.

<span id="ii.CIV-p127"></span>44. “I will sing unto the Lord in my life”
([Psa. 104.33](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#033.md)<span
id="ii.CIV-p127.1"></span>). What will sing? Everything that is willing.
Let us sing unto the Lord in our life. Our life at present is only hope;
our life will be eternity hereafter: the life of mortal life, is the
hope of an everlasting life. “I will praise my God while I have my
being.” Since I am in Him for ever and ever, while I have my being, I
will praise my God. Let us not imagine that, when we have commenced
praising God in that state, we shall have any other work: our whole life
will be for the praises of God. If we become weary of Him whom we
praise, we may also become weary of praising. If He is ever loved, He is
ever praised by us.

<span id="ii.CIV-p128"></span>45. “Let my discourse be pleasing to Him:
my joy shall be in the Lord” ([Psa.
104.34](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#034.md)<span
id="ii.CIV-p128.1"></span>). What is the discourse of man unto God, save
the confession of sins? Confess unto God what thou art, and thou hast
discoursed with Him. Discourse unto Him, do good works, and discourse.
“Wash you, make you clean,” saith Isaiah. <span
id="fr_4773"></span>[4774](#fn_4773.md) What is it to discourse unto God?
Unfold thyself to him who knoweth thee, that He may unfold Himself to
thee who knowest not Him. Behold, it is thy discourse that pleaseth the
Lord; the offering of thy humility, the tribulation of <span
id="page_520">p. 520</span> <span id="ii.CIV-Page_520"></span>thy heart,
the holocaust of thy life, this pleaseth God. But what is pleasing to
thyself? “My joy shall be in the Lord.” This is that discoursing which I
meant between God and thyself: show thyself to Him who knoweth thee, and
He showeth Himself unto thee who knowest not him. Pleasing unto Him is
thy confession: sweet unto thee is His grace. He hath spoken Himself
unto thee. How? By the Word. What Word? Christ.…

<span id="ii.CIV-p130"></span>46. “Let the sinners be consumed out of
the earth” ([Psa. 104.35](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#035.md)<span
id="ii.CIV-p130.1"></span>). He seemeth angry! O holy soul, which here
doth sing and groan! Would that our soul were with that very soul! Would
that it were coupled with it, associated, conjoined with it! It shall
behold also His loving-kindness when he is angry. For who but he who is
filled with charity, understandeth this? Thou tremblest, because he
curseth. And who doth curse? A saint. Without doubt he is listened to.
But it is said unto the saints, “Bless, and curse not.”  <span
id="fr_4774"></span>[4775](#fn_4774.md) What is then the sense of the
words, “Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth”? Let them utterly
be consumed; let their spirit be taken away, that He may send forth His
own Spirit, and they may be restored. “And the ungodly, so that they be
no more.” In what that they be no more, save as wicked men? Let them
therefore be justified, that they may no longer be ungodly. The Psalmist
saw this, and was filled with joy, and repeateth the first verse of the
Psalm: “Bless thou the Lord, O my soul.” Let our soul bless the Lord,
brethren, since He hath deigned to give unto us both understanding and
the power of language, and unto you attention and earnestness in
hearing. Let each, as he can recall to mind what he hath heard, by
mutual conversation stir up the food ye have received, ruminate on what
ye have heard, let it not descend in you into the bowels of
forgetfulness. Let the treasure to be desired <span
id="fr_4775"></span>[4776](#fn_4775.md) rest upon your lips. These matters
have been sought out and discovered with great labour, with great labour
have they been announced and discoursed of; may our toil be fruitful
unto you, and may our soul bless the Lord.

<span id="ii.CIV-p87"></span> *Circumstantia sui exponuntur*. \[He adds,
“If thou hast heard the first letter in the word Deus, and thinkest it
must always belong to it alone, thou wilt blot it out in the word
Diabolus. For the word Deus beginneth with the same letter as the word
Diabolus: and nothing is so far apart, as God from the devil. Consider
how utterly ignorant of things both human and divine he must be, who
shall say of the letter D, it ought not to be used in the beginning of
the word devil; and when thou hast asked the reason, replieth, I read
that letter in the name of God. Such a man is laughed at: for he is not
worthy of an argument. Do not then so childishly interpret these divine
things, as if any of you were to think, from my having said above that
the beasts of the forest signifies the Gentiles, while I now say that
they signify devils and the angels of disobedience, that I am
contradicting what I said before. For they are only figures, and
wherever they occur, are explained by the context they have.”—C.\]
