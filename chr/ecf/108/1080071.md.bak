<span id="ii.LX-p1"></span> <span id="ii.LX-p1.1"></span><span
class="c20"><span id="ii.LX-p1.2"></span>Psalm LX. <span
id="fr_2280"></span>[2281](#fn_2280.md) </span>

<span id="ii.LX-p3"></span>1. David the king was one man, but not one
man he figured; sometimes to wit he figured the Church of many men
consisting, extended even unto the ends of the earth: but sometimes One
Man he figured, Him he figured that is Mediator of God and men, the Man
Christ Jesus. <span id="fr_2281"></span>[2282](#fn_2281.md) In this Psalm
therefore, or rather in this Psalm’s title, certain victorious actions
of David are spoken of:…“To the end, in behalf of those men that shall
be changed unto the title’s inscription, unto teaching for David
himself, when he burned up Mesopotamia in Syria, and Syria Sobal, and
turned Joab, and smote Edom, in the valley of salt-pits twelve
thousand.” We read of these things in the books of the Reigns, <span
id="fr_2282"></span>[2283](#fn_2282.md) that all those persons whom he hath
named, were defeated by David, that is, Mesopotamia in Syria, and Syria
Sobal, Joab, <span id="fr_2283"></span>[2284](#fn_2283.md) Edom. These
things were done, and just as they were done, so there they have been
written, so they are read: let him read that will. Nevertheless, as the
Prophetic Spirit in the Psalms’ titles is wont to depart somewhat from
the expression of things done, and to say something which in history is
not found, and hence rather to admonish us that titles of this kind have
been written not that we may know things done, but that things future
may be prefigured.…But here this thing is inserted for this especial
reason, that there it is not written <span
id="fr_2284"></span>[2285](#fn_2284.md) that he burned up Mesopotamia in
Syria, and Syria Sobal. But now let us begin to examine these things
after the significations of things future, and to bring out the dimness
of shadows into the light of the word.

<span id="ii.LX-p8"></span>2. What is “to the end” ye know. For “the end
of the law is Christ.” <span id="fr_2285"></span>[2286](#fn_2285.md) Those
that are changed ye know. For who but they that do pass from old life
into new?…“For ye were sometime darkness, but now light in the
Lord.” <span id="fr_2286"></span>[2287](#fn_2286.md) But they are changed
“into the title’s inscription,”…who into the kingdom of Christ do pass
over from the kingdom of the devil. It is well that they are changed
unto this title’s inscription. But they are changed, as followeth, “unto
teaching.” He added, “for David himself unto teaching:” that is, are
changed not for themselves, but for David himself, and are changed unto
teaching.…When therefore would Christ have changed us, unless He had
done that which He spake of, “Fire I have come to send into the
world”? <span id="fr_2287"></span>[2288](#fn_2287.md) If therefore Christ
came to send into the world fire, to wit to its health and profit, we
must inquire not how He is to send the world into fire, but how into the
world fire. Inasmuch as therefore He came to send fire into the world,
let us inquire what is Mesopotamia which was burned up, what is Syria
Sobal? The interpretations therefore of the names let us examine
according to the Hebrew language, wherein first this Scripture was
written. Mesopotamia  <span id="fr_2288"></span>[2289](#fn_2288.md) they
say is interpreted, “exalted calling.” Now the whole world by calling
hath been exalted, Syria <span id="fr_2289"></span>[2290](#fn_2289.md) is
interpreted “lofty.” But she which was lofty, burned up hath been and
humbled. Sobal is interpreted “empty antiquity.” Thanks to Christ that
hath burned her. Whenever old bushes are burned up, green places
succeed; and more speedily and more plentifully, and more fully green,
fresh ones spring out, when fire hath gone before them to the burning up
of the old. Let not therefore the fire of Christ be feared, hay it
consumeth. “For all flesh is hay, and all the glory of man as flower of
hay.” <span id="fr_2290"></span>[2291](#fn_2290.md) He burneth up therefore
those things with that fire. “And turned Joab.” Joab is interpreted
enemy. There was turned an enemy, as thou wilt understand it. If turned
unto flight, the devil it is: if converted to the faith, a Christian it
is. How unto flight? From the heart of a Christian: “The Prince of this
world,” He saith, “now hath been cast out.” <span
id="fr_2291"></span>[2292](#fn_2291.md) But how can a Christian turned to
the Lord be an enemy turned? Because he hath become a believer that had
been an enemy. “Smote Edom.” Edom is interpreted “earthly.” That earthly
one ought <span id="page_245">p. 245</span> <span
id="ii.LX-Page_245"></span>to be smitten. For why should one live
earthly, that ought to live heavenly? There hath been slain therefore
life earthly, let there live life heavenly. “For as we have borne the
image of the earthly, let us bear also the image of Him that is from
Heaven.”  <span id="fr_2292"></span>[2293](#fn_2292.md) See it slain:
“Mortify your members which are upon earth.” <span
id="fr_2293"></span>[2294](#fn_2293.md) But when he had smitten Edom, he
smote “twelve thousand in the valley of salt-pits.” Twelve thousand is a
perfect number, to which perfect number also the number of the twelve
Apostles is ascribed: for not to no purpose is it, but because through
the whole world was to be sent the Word. But the Word <span
id="fr_2294"></span>[2295](#fn_2294.md) of God, which is Christ, is in
clouds, that is, in the preachers of truth. But the world of four parts
doth consist. The four parts thereof are exceeding well known to all,
and often in the Scriptures they are mentioned: they are the same as the
name of the four winds, East, West, North, and South. To all these four
parts was sent the Word, so that in the Trinity all might be called. The
number twelve four times three do make. With reason therefore twelve
thousand  <span id="fr_2295"></span>[2296](#fn_2295.md) earthly things were
smitten, the whole world was smitten: for from the whole world was
chosen out the Church, mortified from earthly life. Why “in the valley
of salt-pits”? A valley is humility: salt-pits signify savour. For many
men are humbled, but emptily and foolishly, in empty oldness they are
humbled. One suffereth tribulation for money, suffereth tribulation for
temporal honour, suffereth tribulation for the comforts of this life; he
is to suffer tribulation and to be humbled: why not for the sake of God?
why not for the sake of Christ? why not for the savour of salt? Knowest
thou not that to thee hath been said, “Ye are the salt of earth,” and,
“If the salt shall have been spoiled, for no other thing will it be of
use, but to be cast out”? <span id="fr_2296"></span>[2297](#fn_2296.md) A
good thing it is therefore wisely to be humbled. Behold now are not
heretics being humbled? Have not laws been made even by men to condemn
them, against whom divine laws do reign, which even before had condemned
them? Behold they are humbled, behold they are put to flight, behold
persecution they suffer, but without savour; for folly, for emptiness.
For now the salt hath been spoiled: therefore it hath been cast out, to
be trodden down of men. We have heard the title of the Psalm, let us
hear also the words of the Psalm.

<span id="ii.LX-p21"></span>3. “God, Thou hast driven us back, and hast
destroyed us” ([Psa. 60.1](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#001.md)<span
id="ii.LX-p21.1"></span>). Is that David speaking that smote, that
burned up, that defeated, and not they to whom He did these things, that
is to say, their being smitten and driven back, that were evil men, and
again their being made alive and returning in order that they might be
good men? That destruction indeed that David made, strong of hand, our
Christ, whose figure that man was bearing; He did those things, He made
this destruction with His sword and with His fire: for both He brought
into this world. Both “Fire I am come to send into the world,” <span
id="fr_2297"></span>[2298](#fn_2297.md) thou hast in the Gospel: and “A
sword I have come to send into the earth,” <span
id="fr_2298"></span>[2299](#fn_2298.md) thou hast in the Gospel. He brought
in fire, whereby might be burned up Mesopotamia in Syria, and Syria
Sobal: He brought in a sword whereby might be smitten Edom. Now again
this destruction was made for the sake of “those that are changed unto
the title’s inscription.” Hear we therefore the voice of them: to their
health smitten they were, being raised up let them speak. Let them say,
therefore, that are changed into something better, changed unto the
title’s inscription, changed unto teaching for David himself; let them
say, “Thou hast had mercy upon us.” Thou hast destroyed us, in order
that Thou mightest build us; Thou hast destroyed us that were ill
builded, hast destroyed empty oldness; in order that there may be a
building unto a new man, building to abide for everlasting.…

<span id="ii.LX-p24"></span>4. “Thou hast moved the earth, and hast
troubled it” ([Psa. 60.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#002.md)<span
id="ii.LX-p24.1"></span>). How hath the earth been troubled? In the
conscience of sinners. Whither go we? Whither flee we, when this sword
hath been brandished, “Repent, for near hath drawn the kingdom of
Heaven”? <span id="fr_2299"></span>[2300](#fn_2299.md) “Heal the
crushings <span id="fr_2300"></span>[2301](#fn_2300.md) thereof, for moved
it hath been.” Unworthy it is to be healed, if moved it hath not been:
but thou speakest, preachest, threatenest us with God, of coming
judgment holdest not thy peace, of the commandment of God thou warnest,
from these things thou abstainest not; and he that heareth, if he
feareth not, if he is not moved, is not worthy to be healed. Another
heareth, is moved, is stung, smiteth the breast, sheddeth tears.…

<span id="ii.LX-p27"></span>5. The first labour is, that thou shouldest
be displeasing to thyself, that sins thou shouldest battle out, that
thou shouldest be changed into something better: the second labour, in
return for thy having been changed, is to bear the tribulations and
temptations of this world, and amid them to hold on even unto the end.
Of these things therefore when he was speaking, while pointing out such
things, he addeth what? “Thou hast shown to Thy people hard things”
([Psa. 60.3](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#003.md)<span
id="ii.LX-p27.1"></span>): to Thy people now, made tributary after the
victory of David. “Thou hast shown to Thy people hard things.” Wherein?
In persecutions which the Church of Christ hath endured, when so much
blood of martyrs was spilled. “Thou hast given us to drink of the <span
id="page_246">p. 246</span> <span id="ii.LX-Page_246"></span>wine of
goading.” “Of goading” is what? Not of killing. For it was not a killing
that destroyeth, but a medicine that smarteth.  <span
id="fr_2301"></span>[2302](#fn_2301.md) “Thou hast given us to drink of the
wine of goading.”

<span id="ii.LX-p29"></span>6. Wherefore this? “Thou hast given to men
fearing Thee, a sign that they should flee from the face of the bow”
([Psa. 60.4](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#004.md)<span
id="ii.LX-p29.1"></span>). Through tribulations temporal, he saith, Thou
hast signified to Thine own to flee from the wrath of fire everlasting.
For, saith the Apostle Peter, “Time it is that Judgment begin with the
House of God.” <span id="fr_2302"></span>[2303](#fn_2302.md) And exhorting
the Martyrs to endurance, when the world should rage, when slaughters
should be made at the hands of persecutors, when far and wide blood of
believers should be spilled, when in chains, in prisons, in tortures,
many hard things Christians should suffer, in these hard things, I say,
lest they should faint, Peter saith to them, “Time it is that Judgment
begin with the House of God,” etc. <span
id="fr_2303"></span>[2304](#fn_2303.md) What therefore is to be in the
Judgment? The bow is bended, still in menacing posture it is, not yet in
aiming. And see what there is in the bow: is there not an arrow to be
shot forward? The string however is stretched back in a contrary
direction to that in which it is going to be shot; and the more the
stretching thereof hath gone backward, with the greater swiftness it
starteth forward. What is it that I have said? The more the Judgment is
deferred, with so much the greater swiftness it is to come. Therefore
even for temporal tribulations to God let us render thanks, because He
hath given to His people a sign, “that they should flee from the face of
the bow:” in order that His faithful ones having been exercised in
tribulations temporal, may be worthy to avoid the condemnation of fire
everlasting, which is to find out all them that do not believe these
things.

<span id="ii.LX-p32"></span>7. “That Thy beloved may be delivered: save
me with Thy right hand, and hearken unto me” ([Psa.
60.5](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#005)<span id="ii.LX-p32.1"></span>.md).
With Thy right hand save me, Lord: so save me as that at the right hand
I may stand. Not any safety temporal I require, in this matter Thy Will
be done. For a time what is good for us we are utterly ignorant: for
“what we should pray for as we ought we know not:” <span
id="fr_2304"></span>[2305](#fn_2304.md) but “save me with Thy right hand,”
so that even if in this time I suffer sundry tribulations, when the
night of all tribulations hath been spent, on the right hand I may be
found among the sheep, not on the left hand among the goats. <span
id="fr_2305"></span>[2306](#fn_2305.md) “And hearken unto me.” Because now
I am deserving that which Thou art willing to give; not “with the words
of my transgressions” I am crying through the day, so that Thou hearken
not, and “in the night so that Thou hearken not,” <span
id="fr_2306"></span>[2307](#fn_2306.md) and that not for folly to me,” but
truly for my warning, by adding savour from the valley of salt-pits, so
that in tribulation I may know what to ask: but I ask life everlasting;
therefore hearken unto me, because Thy right hand I ask.…

<span id="ii.LX-p36"></span>8. “God hath spoken in His Holy One” ([Psa.
60.6](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#006.md)<span
id="ii.LX-p36.1"></span>).…In what Holy One of His? “God was in Christ
reconciling the world to Himself.” <span
id="fr_2307"></span>[2308](#fn_2307.md) In that Holy One, of whom elsewhere
ye have heard, “O God, in the Holy One is Thy way.” <span
id="fr_2308"></span>[2309](#fn_2308.md) “I will rejoice and will divide
Sichima.…and the valley of tabernacles I will measure out.” Sichima is
interpreted shoulders. But according to history, Jacob returning from
Laban his father-in-law with all his kindred, hid the idols in
Sichima <span id="fr_2309"></span>[2310](#fn_2309.md) which he had from
Syria, where for a long time he had dwelled, and at length was coming
from thence. But tabernacles he made there because of his sheep and
herds, and called the place Tabernacles. <span
id="fr_2310"></span>[2311](#fn_2310.md) And these I will divide, saith the
Church. What is this, “I will divide Sichima”? If to the story where the
idols were hidden is the reference, the Gentiles it signifieth; I divide
the Gentiles. I divide, is what? “For not in all men is there
faith.” <span id="fr_2311"></span>[2312](#fn_2311.md) I divide, is what?
Some will believe, others will not believe.…The shoulders are divided,
in order that their sins may burthen some men, while others may take up
the burden of Christ. For godly shoulders He was requiring when He said,
“For My yoke is gentle, and My burden is light.” <span
id="fr_2312"></span>[2313](#fn_2312.md) Another burden oppresseth and
loadeth thee, but Christ’s burden relieveth thee: another burden hath
weight, Christ’s burden hath wings. For even if thou pull off the wings
from a bird, thou dost remove a kind of weight; and the more weight thou
hast taken away, the more on earth it will abide. She that thou hast
chosen to disburden lieth there: she flieth not, because thou hast taken
off a weight: let there be given back the weight, and she flieth. Such
is Christ’s burden; let men carry it, and not be idle: let them not be
heeded that will not bear it; let them bear it that will, and they shall
find how light it is, how sweet, how pleasant, how ravishing unto
Heaven, and from earth how transporting.…Perchance because of the sheep
of Jacob, “the valley of Tabernacles” is to be understood of the nation
of the Jews, and the same is divided: for they have passed from thence
that have believed, the rest have remained without.

<span id="ii.LX-p43"></span>9. “Mine is Galaad” ([Psa.
60.7](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#007)<span id="ii.LX-p43.1"></span>.md).
These names are read in the Scriptures of God. Galaad hath the voice of
an interpretation of its own and of a great Mystery: for it is
interpreted “the heap of testimony.” How great a heap of testimony in
the Martyrs? “Mine is Galaad,” mine is a heap of testimony, mine are the
true Martyrs.<span id="page_247">p. 247</span> <span
id="ii.LX-Page_247"></span>…Then meanly esteemed was the Church among
men, then reproach on Her a Widow was being thrown, because Christ’s She
was, because the sign of the Cross on her brow She was wearing: not yet
was there honour, censure there was then: when therefore not honour, but
censure there was, then was made a heap of witness; and through the heap
of witness was the Love of Christ enlarged; and through the enlargement
of the Love of Christ, were the Gentiles possessed. There followeth,
“And mine is Manasses;” which is interpreted forgotten. For to Her had
been said, “Confusion for everlasting Thou shalt forget, and of the
reproach of Thy widowhood Thou shalt not be mindful.” <span
id="fr_2313"></span>[2314](#fn_2313.md) There was therefore a confusion of
the Church once, which now hath been forgotten: for of Her confusion and
of the “reproach” of Her widowhood now She is not mindful. For when
there was a sort of confusion among men, a heap of witness was made. Now
no longer doth any even remember that confusion, when it was a reproach
to be a Christian, now no one remembereth, now all have forgotten, now
“Mine is Manasses, and Ephraim the strength of My head.” Ephraim is
interpreted fruitfulness. Mine, he saith, is fruitfulness, and this
fruitfulness is the strength of My Head. For My Head is Christ. And
whence is fruitfulness the strength of Him? Because unless a grain were
to fall into the earth, it would not be multiplied, alone it would
remain. <span id="fr_2314"></span>[2315](#fn_2314.md) Fall then to earth
did Christ in His Passion, and there followed fruit-bearing in the
Resurrection. He was hanging and was being despised: the grain was
within, it had powers to draw after it all things. How in a grain do
numbers of seeds lie hid, something abject it appeareth to the eyes, but
a power <span id="fr_2315"></span>[2316](#fn_2315.md) turning into itself
matter and bringing forth fruit is hidden; so in Christ’s Cross
virtue <span id="fr_2316"></span>[2317](#fn_2316.md) was hidden, there
appeared weakness. O mighty grain! Doubtless weak is He that hangeth,
Doubtless before Him that people did wag the head, Doubtless they said,
“If Son of God He is, let Him come down from the Cross.” <span
id="fr_2317"></span>[2318](#fn_2317.md) Hear the strength of Him: that
which is a weak thing of God, is stronger than men. <span
id="fr_2318"></span>[2319](#fn_2318.md) With reason so great fruitfulness
hath followed: it is mine, saith the Church.

<span id="ii.LX-p50"></span>10. “Juda is my king: Moab the pot of my
hope” ([Psa. 60.7](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#007.md)<span
id="ii.LX-p50.1"></span>). What Juda? He that is of the tribe of Juda.
What Juda, but He to whom Jacob himself said, “Juda, thy brethren shall
praise thee”? <span id="fr_2319"></span>[2320](#fn_2319.md) What therefore
should I fear, when Juda my king saith, “Fear not them that kill the
body”? <span id="fr_2320"></span>[2321](#fn_2320.md) “Moab the pot of my
hope.” Wherefore “pot”? Because tribulation. Wherefore “of my hope”?
Because there hath gone before Juda my king.…Moab is perceived in the
Gentiles. For that nation was born of sin, <span
id="fr_2321"></span>[2322](#fn_2321.md) that nation was born of the
daughters of Lot, who lay with their father drunken, abusing a father.
Better were it to have remained barren, than thus to have become
mothers. But this was a kind of figure of them that abuse the law. For
do not heed that law in the Latin language is of the feminine gender: in
Greek of the masculine gender it is: but whether it be of the feminine
gender in speaking, or of the masculine, the expression maketh no
difference to the truth. For law hath rather a masculine force, because
it ruleth, is not ruled. But moreover, the Apostle Paul saith what?
“Good is the law, if any one use it lawfully.” <span
id="fr_2322"></span>[2323](#fn_2322.md) But those daughters of Lot
unlawfully used their father. But in the same manner as good works begin
to grow when a man useth well the law: so arise evil works, when a man
ill useth the law. Furthermore, they ill using their father, that is,
ill using the law, engendered the Moabites, by whom are signified evil
works. Thence the tribulation of the Church, thence the pot boiling up.
Of this pot in a certain place of prophecy is said, “A pot heated by the
North wind.”  <span id="fr_2323"></span>[2324](#fn_2323.md) Whence but by
the quarters of the devil, who hath said, “I will set my seat at the
North”? <span id="fr_2324"></span>[2325](#fn_2324.md) The chiefest
tribulations therefore arise against the Church from none except from
those that ill use the law.…

<span id="ii.LX-p57"></span>11. “Into Idumæa I will stretch out my shoe”
([Psa. 60.8](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#008.md)<span
id="ii.LX-p57.1"></span>). The Church speaketh, “I will come through
even unto Idumæa.” Let tribulations rage, let the world boil with
offences, even unto those very persons that lead an earthly life (for
Idumæa is interpreted earthly), even unto those same, “even unto Idumæa,
I will stretch out my shoe.” Of what thing the shoe except of the
Gospel? “How beautiful the feet of them that tell of peace, that tell of
good things,” <span id="fr_2325"></span>[2326](#fn_2325.md) and “the feet
shod unto the preparation of the Gospel of peace.” <span
id="fr_2326"></span>[2327](#fn_2326.md) …In these times we see, brethren,
how many earthly men do perpetrate frauds for the sake of gain, for
frauds perjuries; on account of their fears they consult
fortune-tellers, astrologers: all these men are Edomites, earthly; and
nevertheless all these men adore Christ, under His own shoe they are;
now even unto Idumæa is stretched out His shoe. “To Me Allophyli have
been made subject.” Who are “Allophyli”? Men of other race, not
belonging to My race.  <span id="fr_2327"></span>[2328](#fn_2327.md) They
“have been made subject,” because many men adore Christ, and are not to
reign with Christ.

<span id="ii.LX-p61"></span>12. “Who will lead Me down into the city of
standing round?” ([Psa. 60.9](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#009.md)<span
id="ii.LX-p61.1"></span>). What is the city <span id="page_248">p.
248</span> <span id="ii.LX-Page_248"></span>of standing round? If ye
remember already, I have made mention thereof in another Psalm, <span
id="fr_2328"></span>[2329](#fn_2328.md) wherein hath been said, “And they
shall go around the city.” For the city of standing round is the
compassing around of the Gentiles, which compassing around of the
Gentiles in the middle thereof had the one nation of the Jews,
worshipping one God: the rest of the compassing around of the Gentiles
to idols made supplication, demons they did serve. And mystically it was
called the city of standing round; because on all sides the Gentiles had
poured themselves around, and had stood around that nation which did
worship one God.…“Who will lead me down even unto Idumæa?”

<span id="ii.LX-p63"></span>13. “Wilt not Thou, O God, that hast driven
us back? And wilt not Thou, O God, march forth in our powers?” ([Psa.
60.10](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#010)<span id="ii.LX-p63.1"></span>.md).
Wilt not Thou lead us down, that hast driven us back? But wherefore
“hast driven us back”? Because Thou hast destroyed us. <span
id="fr_2329"></span>[2330](#fn_2329.md) Wherefore hast destroyed us?
Because angry Thou hast been, and hast had pity on us. Thou therefore
wilt lead down, that hast driven back; Thou, O God, that wilt not march
forth in our powers, wilt lead down. What is, “wilt not march forth in
our powers”? The world is to rage, the world is to tread us down, there
is to be a heap of witnesses, builded of the spilled blood of martyrs,
and the raging heathen are to say, “Where is the God of them?”  <span
id="fr_2330"></span>[2331](#fn_2330.md) Then “Thou wilt not march forth in
our powers:” against them Thou wilt not show Thyself, Thou wilt not show
Thy power, such as Thou hast shown in David, in Moses, in Joshua the son
of Nun, when to their might the Gentiles yielded, and when the slaughter
had been ended, and the great laying waste repaired, into the land which
Thou promisedst Thou leddest in Thy people. This thing then Thou wilt
not do, “Thou wilt not march forth in our powers,” but within Thou wilt
work. What is, “wilt not march forth”? Wilt not show Thyself. For indeed
when in chains the Martyrs were being led along, when they were being
shut up in prison, when they were being led forth to be mocked, when to
the beasts they were exposed, <span id="fr_2331"></span>[2332](#fn_2331.md)
when they were being smitten with the sword, when with fire they were
being burned, were they not despised as though forsaken, as though
without helper? In what manner was God working within? in what manner
within was He comforting? in what manner to these men was He making
sweet the hope of life everlasting? in what manner was He not forsaking
the hearts of them, where the man was dwelling <span
id="fr_2332"></span>[2333](#fn_2332.md) in silence, well if good, ill if
evil? Was He then by any means forsaking, because He was not marching
forth in the powers <span id="fr_2333"></span>[2334](#fn_2333.md) of them?
By not marching forth in the powers of them, did He not the more lead
down the Church even unto Idumæa, lead down the Church even unto the
city of standing around? For if the Church chose to war and to use the
sword, She would seem to be fighting for life present: but because she
was despising life present, therefore there was made a heap of witness
for the life that shall be.

<span id="ii.LX-p69"></span>14. Thou therefore, O God, that wilt not
march forth in our powers, “Give to us aid from tribulation, and vain is
the safety of man” ([Psa. 60.11](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#011.md)<span
id="ii.LX-p69.1"></span>). Go now they that salt have not, and desire
safety temporal for their friends, which is empty oldness. “Give to us
aid:” from thence whence Thou wast supposed to forsake, thence succour.
“In God we will do valour, <span id="fr_2334"></span>[2335](#fn_2334.md)
and Himself to nothing shall bring down our enemies” ([Psa.
60.12](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#012)<span id="ii.LX-p70.1"></span>.md).
We will not do valour with the sword, not with horses, not with
breastplates, not with shields, not in the mightiness of an army, not
abroad. But where? Within, where we are not seen. Where within? “In God
we will do virtue:” and as if abjects, and as if trodden down, men as if
of no consideration we shall be, but “Himself to nothing shall bring
down our enemies.” In a word, this thing hath been done to our enemies.
Trodden down have been the Martyrs: by suffering, by enduring, by
persevering even unto the end, in God they have done valour. Himself
also hath done that which followeth: to nothing He hath brought down the
enemies of them. Where are now the enemies of the Martyrs, except
perchance that now drunken men with their cups do persecute those whom
at that time frenzied men did use with stones to persecute?
