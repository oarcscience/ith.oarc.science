<span id="ii.CXIX.xvi-p1"></span> *<span class="c2"><span

<span id="ii.CXIX.xvi-p2"></span>119. “I have dealt judgment and
righteousness; O give me not over unto mine oppressors” <span
id="fr_5309"></span>[5310](#fn_5309.md) ([Psa.
119.121](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#121.md)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xvi-p3.3"></span>). It is not wonderful that he should have
dealt judgment and righteousness, since he had above prayed for a chaste
fear from God, whereby to fix with nails his flesh, that is, his carnal
lusts, which are wont to hinder our judgment from being right. But
although in our customary speech judgment is either right or wrong,
whence it is said unto men in the Gospel, “Judge not according to the
persons, but judge righteous judgment:”  <span
id="fr_5310"></span>[5311](#fn_5310.md) nevertheless in this passage
judgment is used as though, if it were not righteous, it ought not to be
called judgment; otherwise it would not be enough to say, “I have dealt
judgment,” but it would be said, I have dealt righteous judgment.…

<span id="page_581">p. 581</span> <span
id="ii.CXIX.xvi-Page_581"></span>

<span id="ii.CXIX.xvi-p5"></span>120. Whoso therefore in the chaste fear
of God hath his flesh crucified, and corrupted by no carnal allurement,
dealeth judgment and the work of righteousness, ought to pray that he
may not be given up to his adversaries; that is, that he may not,
through his dread of suffering evils, yield unto his adversaries to do
evil. For he receiveth power of endurance, which guardeth him from being
overcome with pain, from Him from whom he receiveth the victory over
lust, which preventeth his being seduced by pleasure. <span
id="fr_5311"></span>[5312](#fn_5311.md)

<span id="ii.CXIX.xvi-p7"></span>121. He next saith, “Take off Thy
servant to that which is good, that the proud calumniate me not” ([Psa.
119.122](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#122.md)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xvi-p7.1"></span>). They drive me on, that I may fall into
evil; do Thou take me off to that which is good. They who rendered these
words by the Latin, *calumnientur,* have followed a Greek expression,
not commonly used in Latin. Have the words, Let not the proud calumniate
me, the same force, as, Let them “not succeed in calumniating me”?

<span id="ii.CXIX.xvi-p8"></span>122. …To prefigure His Cross, Moses by
the merciful command of God raised aloft on a pole the image of a
serpent in the desert, that the likeness of sinful flesh which must be
crucified in Christ might be prefigured. <span
id="fr_5312"></span>[5313](#fn_5312.md) By gazing upon this healing Cross,
we cast out all the poison of the scandals of the proud: the Cross,
which the Psalmist intently looking upon, saith, “My eyes have failed
for Thy salvation, and for the words of Thy righteousness” ([Psa.
119.123](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#123.md)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xvi-p9.2"></span>). For God made Christ Himself “to be sin
for us, on account of the likeness of sinful flesh, that we may be made
the righteousness of God in Him.”  <span
id="fr_5313"></span>[5314](#fn_5313.md) For His utterance <span
id="fr_5314"></span>[5315](#fn_5314.md) of the righteousness of God he
therefore saith that his eyes have failed, from gazing ardently and
eagerly, while, remembering human infirmity, he longeth for divine grace
in Christ.

<span id="ii.CXIX.xvi-p12"></span>123. In connection with this he goes
on to say, “O deal with Thy servant according to Thy loving mercy”
([Psa. 119.124](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#124.md)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xvi-p12.1"></span>); not according to my righteousness. “And
teach me,” he saith, “Thy righteousnesses;” those beyond doubt, whereby
God rendereth men righteous, not they themselves.

<span id="ii.CXIX.xvi-p13"></span>124. “I am Thy servant. O grant me
understanding, that I may know Thy testimonies” ([Psa.
119.125](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#125.md)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xvi-p13.1"></span>). This petition must never be
intermitted. For it sufficeth not to have received understanding, and to
have learnt the testimonies of God, unless it be evermore received, and
evermore in a manner quaffed from the fountain of eternal light. For the
testimonies of God are the better and the better known, the more
understanding a man attaineth to.

<span id="ii.CXIX.xvi-p14"></span>125. “It is time,” he saith, “for the
Lord to lay to His hand” ([Psa.
119.126](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#126.md)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xvi-p14.1"></span>). For this is the reading of most copies:
not as some have, “O Lord.” Now what is this, save the grace which was
revealed in Christ at its own time? Of which season the Apostle saith,
“But when the fullness of time was come, God sent His Son.” <span
id="fr_5315"></span>[5316](#fn_5315.md) …But wherefore is it that,
seemingly anxious to show the Lord that it was time to lay to His hand,
he hath subjoined, “They have scattered Thy law;” as if it were the
season for the Lord to act, because the proud scattered His law. For
what meaneth this? In the wickedness of transgression, they have not
guarded its integrity. It was needful therefore that the Law should be
given to the proud and those presuming in the freedom of their own will,
after a transgression of which whosoever were contrite and humbled,
might run no longer by the Law, but by faith, to aiding grace. When the
Law therefore was scattered, it was time that mercy should be sent
through the only-begotten Son of God.

<span id="ii.CXIX.xvi-p16"></span>126. “Therefore,” he saith, “I love
Thy commandments above gold and topaz” ([Psa.
119.127](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#127.md)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xvi-p16.1"></span>). Grace hath this object, that the
commandments, which could not be fulfilled by fear, may be fulfilled by
love…Therefore, they are above gold and topaz stones. For this is read
in another Psalm also, “Above gold and exceeding precious stones.” <span
id="fr_5316"></span>[5317](#fn_5316.md) For topaz is a stone considered
very precious. But they not understanding the hidden grace which was in
the Old Testament, screened as it were by the veil <span
id="fr_5317"></span>[5318](#fn_5317.md) (this was signified when they were
unable to gaze upon the face of Moses), endeavoured to obey the
commandments of God for the sake of an earthly and carnal reward, but
could not obey them; because they did not love them, but something else.
Whence these were not the works of the willing, but rather the burdens
of the unwilling. But when the commandments are loved for their own sake
“above gold and exceeding precious stones,” all earthly reward compared
with the commandments themselves is vile; nor are any other goods of man
comparable in any respect with those goods whereby man himself is made
good.

<span id="ii.CXIX.xvi-p19"></span>127. “Therefore,” he saith, “was I
made straight unto all Thy commandments” ([Psa.
119.128](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#128.md)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xvi-p19.1"></span>). I was made straight, doubtless, because
I loved them; and I clung by love to them, which were straight, that I
might also myself become straight. Then what he addeth, naturally
follows: “and every unrighteous way I utterly abhor.” For how could it
be that he who loved the straight could do aught save abhor an
unrighteous way? For as, if he loved gold and precious stones, he would
abhor all that might bring loss of such property: thus, since he loved
the command<span id="page_582">p. 582</span> <span
id="ii.CXIX.xvi-Page_582"></span>ments of God, he abhorred the path of
iniquity, as one of the most savage rocks in the sailor’s track, whereon
he must needs suffer shipwreck of things so precious. That this may not
be his lot, he who saileth on the wood of the Cross with the divine
commandments as his freight, steereth far from thence.

<span id="ii.CXIX.xvi-p3"></span> \[The author says: “For some copies
read, to them that persecute me: the Greek words <span

being variously interpreted by the Latin *nocentibus*, *persequentibus*,

version *adversantibus* in any of the copies which I have read, since
there is no doubt that the Greek ‡<span class="Greek"><span
