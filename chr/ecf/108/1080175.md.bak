<span id="ii.CXLII-p1"></span> <span id="ii.CXLII-p1.1"></span><span
class="c20"><span id="ii.CXLII-p1.2"></span>Psalm CXLII. <span
id="fr_5790"></span>[5791](#fn_5790.md) </span>

<span id="ii.CXLII-p3"></span>1. …“With my voice have I cried unto the
Lord” ([Psa. 142.1](../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#001.md)<span
id="ii.CXLII-p3.1"></span>). It were enough to say, “with voice:” not
for nothing perhaps has “my” been added. For many cry unto the Lord, not
with their own voice, but with the voice of their body. Let the “inner
man” then, in whom “Christ” hath begun to “dwell by faith,” <span
id="fr_5791"></span>[5792](#fn_5791.md) cry unto the Lord, not with the din
of his lips, but with the affection of his heart. God heareth not, where
man heareth: unless thou criest with the voice of lungs and side and
tongue, man heareth thee not: thy thought is thy cry to the Lord. “With
my voice have I prayed unto the Lord.” What he meant by, “I have cried,”
he explained when he said, “I have prayed.” For they too who blaspheme,
cry unto the Lord. In the former part he set down his crying, in the
latter he explained what it was. As though it were demanded, With what
cry hast thou cried unto the Lord? Unto the Lord, saith he, I have
prayed. My cry is my prayer, not reviling, not murmuring, not
blaspheming.

<span id="ii.CXLII-p5"></span>2. “I will pour out before Him my prayer”
([Psa. 142.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#002.md)<span
id="ii.CXLII-p5.1"></span>). What is, “before Him”? In His sight. What
is, in His sight? Where He seeth. But where doth He not see? For so do
we say, <span id="page_649">p. 649</span> <span
id="ii.CXLII-Page_649"></span>‘where He seeth,’ as though somewhere He
seeth not. But in this assemblage of bodily substances men too see,
animals too see: He seeth where man seeth not. For thy thoughts no man
seeth, but God seeth. There then pour out thy prayer, where He alone
seeth, who rewardeth. For the Lord Jesus Christ bade thee pray in
secret: but if thou knowest what “thy closet” is, and cleansest it,
there thou prayest to God. “But thou,” saith He, “when thou prayest,
enter into thy closet, and shut the door, and pray to thy Father in
secret, and He who seeth in secret shall reward thee.” <span
id="fr_5792"></span>[5793](#fn_5792.md) If men are to reward thee, pour out
thy prayer before men: if God is to reward thee, pour out thy prayer
before Him; and close the door, lest the tempter enter. Therefore the
Apostle, because it is in our power to shut the door, the door of our
hearts, not of our walls, for in it is our “closet,”—because it is in
our power to shut this door, saith, “neither give place to the
devil.” <span id="fr_5793"></span>[5794](#fn_5793.md) But what is to “shut
the door”? This door hath as it were two leaves, desire and fear. Either
thou desireth something earthly, and he enters by this; or thou fearest
something earthly, and he enters by that. Close then the door of fear
and desire against the devil, open it to Christ. How dost thou open
these folding doors to Christ? By desiring the kingdom of heaven, by
fearing the fire of hell. By desire of this world the devil entereth, by
desire of eternal life Christ entereth; by fear of temporal punishment
the devil entereth, by fear of everlasting fire Christ entereth.…

<span id="ii.CXLII-p8"></span>3. “My tribulation I will proclaim in His
sight.” There is a repetition, both in the two preceding sentences, and
in these which follow: the sentiments are two, but both twice
expressed.…For, “in His sight,” is the same as “before Him;” “I will
proclaim my tribulation,” is the same as, “I will pour out my prayer.”
When doest thou this? Being set in the midst of persecution, he saith,
“while my spirit failed from me” ([Psa.
142.3](../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#003.md)<span
id="ii.CXLII-p8.1"></span>). Wherefore hath thy spirit failed, O martyr,
set in tribulation? That I may not claim my strength as mine own, that I
may know that Another worketh in me the goodness I have. And men perhaps
have heard that my spirit hath failed within me, and have despaired of
me, and have said, “we have taken him captive, we have overpowered him;”
“and Thou hast known my paths.” They thought me cast down, Thou didst
see me standing upright. They who persecuted me and had seized me,
thought my feet entangled, “but their feet were entangled, and they
fell, but we are risen, and stand upright.” <span
id="fr_5794"></span>[5795](#fn_5794.md) For mine eyes are ever unto the
Lord, for He shall pluck my feet out of the net.” <span
id="fr_5795"></span>[5796](#fn_5795.md) I have persevered in walking, for
“he that shall persevere unto the end, the same shall be saved.” <span
id="fr_5796"></span>[5797](#fn_5796.md) They thought me overpowered, but I
continued walking. Where did I walk? In paths which they saw not, who
thought me prisoner, in the paths of Thy righteousness, in the paths of
Thy commandments.…For every path is a way, but not every way is a path.
Why then are those ways called paths, save because they are narrow?
Broad is the way of the wicked, narrow the way of the righteous. That
which is “the way” is also “the ways,” just as “the Church” is also “the
Churches,” the “heaven” also the “heavens:” they are spoken of in the
plural, they are spoken of also in the singular. On account of the unity
of the Church it is one Church; “My dove is one, she is the only one of
her mother.” <span id="fr_5797"></span>[5798](#fn_5797.md) On account of
the congregation of brethren in various places there are many Churches.
“The Churches of Judæa which are in Christ rejoiced,” saith Paul, <span
id="fr_5798"></span>[5799](#fn_5798.md) “and they glorified God in me.”
Thus he spake of Churches; and of one Church he thus speaketh, “Give
none offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the
Church of God.”…

<span id="ii.CXLII-p14"></span>4. “In this way, wherein I was walking,
they hid a trap for me.” This “way wherein I was walking,” is Christ;
there have they laid a trap for me, who persecute me in Christ, for
Christ’s Name’s sake. There then “have they hid for me a trap.” What in
me do they hate, what in me do they persecute? That I am a
Christian.…For the heretics too wish to hide a stumbling-block for us in
the Name of Christ, and are themselves deceived. What they think that
they put in the way, they put outside the way, for they themselves are
outside the way. They cannot set a trap where themselves are not.…The
Pagan thinketh to put a stumbling-block in the way, when he saith to me,
“Thou worshippest a crucified God.” He findeth fault with the Cross of
Christ, which he understandeth not. He thinketh that he setteth in
Christ, what he setteth near the way. I will not depart from Christ, so
shall I not fall from the way into the trap. Let him mock at Christ
crucified, let me see the Cross of Christ on the foreheads of kings.
What he laugheth at, therein am I saved. Nought is prouder than a sick
man, who laugheth at his own medicine. If he laughed not at it, he would
take it, and be healed. The Cross is the sign of humility, but he
through excess of pride acknowledgeth not that whereby may be healed the
swelling of his soul. But if I acknowledge, I am walking in the way. So
far am I from blushing at the Cross, that in no secret place do I keep
the Cross of Christ, but bear it on my <span id="page_650">p. 650</span>
<span id="ii.CXLII-Page_650"></span>forehead. Many sacraments we
receive, one in one way another in another: some as ye know we receive
with the mouth, some we receive over the whole body. But because the
forehead is the seat of the blush of shame, He who said, “Whosoever
shall be ashamed of Me before men, of him will I be ashamed before My
Father which is in heaven,” <span id="fr_5799"></span>[5800](#fn_5799.md)
set, so to speak, that very ignominy which the Pagans mock at, in the
seat of our shame. Thou hearest a man assail a shameless man and say,
“He hath no forehead.” What is, “He hath no forehead”? He hath no shame.
Let me not have a bare forehead, let the Cross of my Lord cover it.…

<span id="ii.CXLII-p16"></span>5. “I considered upon the right hand, and
saw” ([Psa. 142.4](../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#004.md)<span
id="ii.CXLII-p16.1"></span>). He considered upon the right hand, and
saw: whoso considereth upon the left hand, is blinded. What is to
consider on the right hand? Where they will be to whom shall be said,
“Come, ye blessed of My Father,” etc., <span
id="fr_5800"></span>[5801](#fn_5800.md) …He goeth on to say, “and there was
none that knew me.” For when thou fearest all things, who knoweth what
thou regardest, whether thou directest thine eyes to the right hand or
to the left? If, in bearing, thou seekest the praise of men, thou hast
regarded the left: if, in bearing, thou seekest the promises of God,
thou hast regarded the right hand. Hast thou regarded the right hand,
thou shalt see: hast thou regarded the left hand, thou shalt be blinded.
But even when thou seest on the right hand, there will be none to know
thee. For who comforteth thee save the Lord? “Flight hath perished from
me.” He speaketh as though he were hemmed in. Let the persecutors
rejoice over him; he is overpowered, he is taken, he is hemmed in, he is
conquered. “Flight hath perished” from him who fleeth not. But he who
fleeth not, suffereth whatever he can for Christ: that is, he fleeth not
in soul. For in body it is lawful to flee; it is allowed, it is
permitted; for the Lord saith, “When they persecute you in one city,
flee to another.” <span id="fr_5801"></span>[5802](#fn_5801.md) He then who
fleeth not in soul, from him “flight hath perished.” But it maketh a
difference why he fleeth not; whether because he is hemmed in, because
he is caught, or because he is brave. For both from him that is caught
flight hath perished, and from him that is brave flight hath perished.
What flight then is to be avoided? what flight shall we allow to perish
from us? That whereof the Lord speaketh in the Gospel, “The Good
Shepherd layeth down his life for the sheep. But he that is an hireling,
and not the shepherd, when he seeth the wolf coming, fleeth.” When he
seeth the ravager, why fleeth he? “Because he careth not for the
sheep.” <span id="fr_5802"></span>[5803](#fn_5802.md) …In two ways a man’s
life is sought, either by his persecutors or by his lovers. <span
id="fr_5803"></span>[5804](#fn_5803.md) So then “there is none to seek my
life,” he said of them; verily they persecute my life, and they seek not
my life. But if they seek my life, they will find it clinging to Thee:
and if they know to seek it, they know also to imitate it.

<span id="ii.CXLII-p21"></span>6. “Unto thee have I cried, O Lord: I
have said, Thou art my hope” ([Psa.
142.5](../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#005.md)<span
id="ii.CXLII-p21.1"></span>). When I endured, when I was in tribulation,
“I said, Thou art my hope.” My hope here, therefore I endure. But “my
portion,” not here, but “in the land of the living.” God giveth a
portion in the land of the living; but not something from Himself
without Himself. What will He give to one that loveth Him, save Himself?

<span id="ii.CXLII-p22"></span>7. “Give heed unto my prayer, for much
have I been humbled” ([Psa. 142.6](../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#006.md)<span
id="ii.CXLII-p22.1"></span>). Humbled by persecutors, humbled in
confession. He humbleth himself out of the sight of man: he is humbled
by enemies in their sight. Therefore is he lifted up by Him both visibly
and invisibly. Invisibly are the martyrs already lifted up; visibly
shall they be lifted up, “when this corruptible shall have put on
incorruption” in the resurrection of the dead; when this very part of
him, against which alone her persecutors could rage, shall be renewed.
“Fear not them that kill the body, but cannot kill the soul.” <span
id="fr_5804"></span>[5805](#fn_5804.md) And what perisheth? what kill
they?…Why then art thou anxious about the rest of thy members, when thou
shalt not lose even a hair? <span id="fr_5805"></span>[5806](#fn_5805.md)
“Deliver me from them that persecute me.” From whom thinkest thou that
he prayeth to be delivered? From men who persecuted him? Is it so? are
merely men our enemies? We have other enemies, invisible, who persecute
us in another way. Man persecuteth, that he may slay the body; another
persecuteth, that he ensnare the soul. <span
id="fr_5806"></span>[5807](#fn_5806.md) …There are then other enemies of
ours too, from whom we ought to pray God to deliver us, lest they lead
us astray, either by crushing us with troubles of this world, or
alluring us by its enticements. Who are these enemies? Let us see
whether they are plainly described by any servant of the Lord, by any
soldier, now perfected, who hath engaged with them. Hear the Apostle
saying, “We wrestle not against flesh and blood:” <span
id="fr_5807"></span>[5808](#fn_5807.md) as though he would say, Turn not
your hatred against men; think not them your enemies; think not that it
is by their hostility you are being bruised; these men whom ye fear are
flesh and blood.…“For they are strengthened over me.” Who said, “they
are strengthened over me”? The Body of Christ crieth out; it is the
voice of the Church; the members of Christ cry out, “Much hath the
number of sinners increased.” “Because iniquity hath abounded, the love
of many waxeth cold.”  <span id="fr_5808"></span>[5809](#fn_5808.md)

<span id="ii.CXLII-p28"></span>8. “Bring forth my soul out of prison,
that <span id="page_651">p. 651</span> <span
id="ii.CXLII-Page_651"></span>it may confess to Thy Name” ([Psa.
142.7](../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#007.md)<span
id="ii.CXLII-p28.1"></span>). This “prison” has been variously
understood by former writers. And perhaps it is the prison which is
called in the title, “the cave.” For the title of this Psalm runneth
thus: “Of understanding to David himself, a prayer when he was in the
cave.” That which is the cave, the same is also the prison. Two things
have we set before us to understand, but when we have understood one,
both will be understood. A man’s deserts make a prison. For in one
dwelling place one man finds a house, another a prison.…To some then it
has seemed that the “cave” and “prison” are this world; and this the
Church prayeth, that it may be brought out of prison, that is, from this
world, from under the sun, where all is vanity. <span
id="fr_5809"></span>[5810](#fn_5809.md) Beyond this world then God
promiseth that we shall be in some sort of rest; therefore perhaps do we
cry concerning this place, “Bring my soul out of prison.” Our soul by
faith and hope is in Christ; “Your life is hid with Christ in God.” But
our body is in this prison, in this world.…But some have said, that this
prison and cave is this body, so that this is the meaning of, “Bring my
soul out of prison.” But this interpretation too is somewhat at fault.
For what great thing is it to say, “Bring my soul out of prison,” bring
my soul out of the body? Do not the souls of robbers and wicked men go
forth from the body, and go into worse punishment than here they have
endured? What great request then is this, “Bring my soul out of prison,”
when, sooner or later, it must needs come forth? Perhaps the righteous
saith, “Let me die now; bring forth my soul from this prison of the
body.” If he be too hasty, he hath not love. He ought indeed to long for
and desire, as the Apostle saith, “having a desire to be dissolved and
to be with Christ, which is far better.” But where is love? Therefore it
followeth, “but to abide in the flesh is needful for you.” Let God then
lead us forth from the body, when He will. Our body too might be said to
be a prison, not because that is a prison which God hath made, but
because it is under punishment and liable to death. For there are two
things to be considered in our body, God’s workmanship, and the
punishment it has deserved.…Perhaps then he meant by, “Bring my soul out
of prison,” bring my soul out of corruption. If thus we understand it,
it is no blasphemy, the meaning is consistent. Lastly, brethren, as I
think, he meant this; “Bring my soul out of prison,” bring it out of
straitness. For to one who rejoiceth, even a prison is wide; to one in
sorrow, a field is strait. Therefore prayeth he to be brought out of
straitness. For though in hope he have enlargement, yet in reality at
present he is straitened.…It is not the body that weigheth down the
soul, but the corruptible body. It is not the body then that maketh the
prison, but the corruption. “Bring my soul out of prison, that it may
give thanks to Thy Name.” Now the words which follow seem to come from
the Head, our Lord Jesus Christ. And they are the same as yesterday’s
last words. Yesterday’s last words, if ye remember, were, “I am alone,
until I pass over.” And here what are the last words? “The righteous
shall sustain me, until thou recompense me.”
