<span id="ii.LXXXII-p1"></span> <span id="ii.LXXXII-p1.1"></span><span
class="c20"><span id="ii.LXXXII-p1.2"></span>Psalm LXXXII. <span
id="fr_3828"></span>[3829](#fn_3828.md) </span>

<span id="ii.LXXXII-p3"></span>1. This Psalm, like others similarly
named, was so entitled either from the name of the man who wrote it, or
from the explanation of that same name, so as to refer in meaning to the
Synagogue, which Asaph signifies; especially as this is intimated in the
first verse. For it begins, “God stood in the synagogue of gods” ([Psa.
82.1](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#001.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXII-p3.1"></span>). Far however be it from us to understand by
these Gods the gods of the Gentiles, or idols, or any creature in heaven
or earth except men; for a little after this verse the same Psalm
relates and explains what Gods it means in whose synagogue God stood,
where it says, “I have said, Ye are gods, and ye are all the children of
the Most High: but ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the
princes.” In the synagogue of these children of the Most High, of whom
the same Most High said by the mouth of Isaiah, “I have begotten sons
and brought them up, but they despised Me,” <span
id="fr_3829"></span>[3830](#fn_3829.md) stood God. By the synagogue we
understand the people of Israel, because synagogue is the word properly
used of them, although they were also called the Church. Our
congregation, on the contrary, the Apostles never called synagogue, but
always Ecclesia; whether for the sake of the distinction, or because
there is some difference between a congregation whence the synagogue has
its name, and a convocation whence the Church is called Ecclesia: <span
id="fr_3830"></span>[3831](#fn_3830.md) for the word congregation (or
flocking together) is used of cattle, and particularly of that kind
properly called “flocks,” <span id="fr_3831"></span>[3832](#fn_3831.md)
whereas convocation (or calling together) is more of reasonable
creatures, such as men are.…I think then that it is clear in what
synagogue of gods God stood.

<span id="ii.LXXXII-p7"></span>2. The next question is, whether we
should understand the Father, or the Son, or the Holy Spirit, or the
Trinity, “to have stood among the congregation of gods, and in the midst
to distinguish the gods;” because Each One is God, and the Trinity
itself is One God. It is not indeed easy to make this clear, because it
cannot be denied that not a bodily but a spiritual presence of God,
agreeable to His nature, exists with created things in a wonderful
manner, and one which but a few do understand, and that imperfectly: as
to God it is said, “If I shall ascend into heaven, Thou art there; if I
shall go down into hell, Thou art there also.” <span
id="fr_3832"></span>[3833](#fn_3832.md) Hence it is rightly said, that God
stands in the congregation of men invisibly, as He fills heaven and
earth, which He asserts of Himself by the Prophet’s mouth; <span
id="fr_3833"></span>[3834](#fn_3833.md) and He is not only said, but is, in
a way, known to stand in those things which He hath created, as far as
the human mind can conceive, if man also stands and hears Him, and
rejoices greatly on account of His voice within. But I think that the
Psalm intimates something that took place at a particular time, by God’s
<span id="page_396">p. 396</span> <span
id="ii.LXXXII-Page_396"></span>standing in the congregation of gods. For
that standing by which He fills heaven and earth, neither belongs
peculiarly to the synagogue, nor varies from time to time. “God,”
therefore, “stood in the congregation of gods;” that is, He who said of
Himself, “I am not sent but to the lost sheep of the house of
Israel.” <span id="fr_3834"></span>[3835](#fn_3834.md) The cause too is
mentioned; “but in the midst, to judge of the gods.”…

<span id="ii.LXXXII-p11"></span>3. “How long will ye judge
unrighteously, and accept the persons of the ungodly” ([Psa.
82.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#002.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXII-p11.1"></span>); as in another place, “How long are ye
heavy in heart?” <span id="fr_3835"></span>[3836](#fn_3835.md) Until He
shall come who is the light of the heart? I have given a law, ye have
resisted stubbornly: I sent Prophets, ye treated them unjustly, or slew
them, or connived at those who did so. But if they are not worthy to be
even spoken to, who slew the servants of God that were sent to them, ye
who were silent when these things were doing, that is, ye who would
imitate as if they were innocent those who then were silent, “how long
will ye judge unrighteously, and accept the persons of the ungodly?” If
the Heir comes even now, is He to be slain? Was He not willing for your
sake to become as it were a child under guardians? Did not He for your
sake hunger and thirst like one in need? Did He not cry to you, “Learn
of Me, for I am meek and lowly of heart”? <span
id="fr_3836"></span>[3837](#fn_3836.md) Did He not “become poor, when He
was rich, that by His poverty we might be made rich”? <span
id="fr_3837"></span>[3838](#fn_3837.md) “Give sentence,” therefore, “for
the fatherless <span id="fr_3838"></span>[3839](#fn_3838.md) and the poor
man, justify the humble and needy” ([Psa.
82.3](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#003.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXII-p15.1"></span>). Not them who for their own sake are rich
and proud, but Him who for your sake was humble and poor, believe ye to
be righteous: proclaim Him righteous. But they will envy Him, and will
not at all spare Him, saying, “This is the Heir, come, let us kill Him,
and the inheritance shall be ours.” “Deliver,” then, “the poor man, and
save the needy from the hands of the ungodly” ([Psa.
82.4](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#004.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXII-p15.2"></span>). This is said that it might be known, that
in that nation where Christ was born and put to death, those persons
were not guiltless of so great a crime, who being so numerous, that, as
the Gospel says, the Jews feared them, and therefore dared not lay hands
on Christ, afterwards consented, and permitted Him to be slain by the
malicious and envious Jewish rulers: yet if they had so willed, they
would still have been feared, so that the hands of the wicked would
never have prevailed against Him. For of these it is said elsewhere,
“Dumb dogs, they know not how to bark.” Of them too is that said, “Lo,
how the righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart.” <span
id="fr_3839"></span>[3840](#fn_3839.md) He perished <span
id="fr_3840"></span>[3841](#fn_3840.md) as far as lay in them who would
have Him to perish; for how could He perish by dying, who in that way
rather was seeking again what had perished? If then they are justly
blamed and deservedly rebuked, who by their dissembling suffered such a
wicked deed to be committed; how must they be blamed, or rather not only
blamed, but how severely must they be condemned, who did this of design
and malice?

<span id="ii.LXXXII-p18"></span>4. To all of them, verily, what follows
is most fitly suited: “They did not know nor understand, they walk on in
darkness” ([Psa. 82.5](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#005.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXII-p18.1"></span>). “For if even they had known, they would
never have crucified the Lord of glory:” <span
id="fr_3841"></span>[3842](#fn_3841.md) and those others, if they had
known, would never have consented to ask that Barabbas should be freed,
and Christ should be crucified. But as the above-mentioned blindness
happened in part unto Israel until the fulness of the Gentiles should
come in, this blindness of that People having caused the crucifixion of
Christ, “all the foundations of the earth shall be moved.” So have they
been moved, and shall they be moved, until the predestined fulness of
the Gentiles shall come in. For at the actual death of the Lord the
earth was moved, and the rocks rent. <span
id="fr_3842"></span>[3843](#fn_3842.md) And if we understand by the
foundations of the earth those who are rich in the abundance of earthly
possessions, it was truly foretold that they should be moved, either by
wondering that lowliness, poverty, death, should be so loved and
honoured in Christ, when it is to their mind great misery; or even in
that themselves should love and follow it, and set at nought the vain
happiness of this world. So are all the foundations of the earth moved,
while they partly admire, and partly are even altered. For as without
absurdity we call foundations of heaven those on whom the kingdom of
heaven is built up in the persons of saints and faithful; whose first
foundation is Christ Himself, born of the Virgin, of whom the Apostle
says, “Other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid, which is
Christ Jesus;” <span id="fr_3843"></span>[3844](#fn_3843.md) next the
Apostles and Prophets themselves, by whose authority the heavenly place
is chosen, <span id="fr_3844"></span>[3845](#fn_3844.md) that by obeying
them we may be builded together with them; whence he says to the
Ephesians, “Ye are built upon the foundation of Apostles and Prophets,
Christ Jesus Himself being the chief corner stone.” <span
id="fr_3845"></span>[3846](#fn_3845.md) …But the kingdom of earthly
happiness is pride, to oppose which came the lowliness of Christ,
rebuking those whom He wished by lowliness to make the children of the
Most High, and blaming them: “I said, Ye are gods, ye are all the
children of the Most High” ([Psa.
82.6](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#006.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXII-p23.2"></span>). “But ye shall die like men, and fall like
one of the princes” ([Psa. 82.7](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#007.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXII-p23.3"></span>). Whether to those He said this, “I said,
Ye are gods,” and to those <span id="page_397">p. 397</span> <span
id="ii.LXXXII-Page_397"></span>particularly who are unpredestined to
eternal life; and to the other, “But ye shall die like men,” etc., “and
shall fall like one of the princes,” in this way also distinguishing the
gods; or whether He blames all together, in order to distinguish the
obedient and those who received correction, “I said, Ye are gods, and ye
are all the children of the Most High:” that is, to all of you I
promised celestial happiness, “but ye,” through the infirmity of your
flesh, “shall die like men,” and through haughtiness of soul, “like one
of the princes,” that is, the devil, shall not be exalted, but “shall
fall.” As if He said: Though the days of your life are so few, that ye
speedily die like men, this avails not to your correction: but like the
devil, whose days are many in this world, because he dies not in the
flesh, ye are lifted up so that ye fall. For by devilish pride it came
to pass that the perverse and blind rulers of the Jews envied the glory
of Christ: by this will it came to pass, and still does, that the
lowliness of Christ crucified unto death is lightly esteemed in the eyes
of them who love the excellence of this world.

<span id="ii.LXXXII-p24"></span>5. And therefore that this vice may be
cured, in the person of the Prophet himself it is said, “Arise, O God,
and judge the earth” ([Psa. 82.8](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#008.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXII-p24.1"></span>); for the earth swelled high when it
crucified Thee: rise from the dead, and judge the earth. “For Thou shalt
destroy among all nations.” What, but the earth? that is, destroying
those who savour of earthly things, or destroying the feeling itself of
earthly lust and pride in believers; or separating those who do not
believe, as earth to be trodden under foot and to perish. Thus by His
members, whose conversation is in heaven, He judges the earth, and
destroys it among all nations. But I must not omit to remark, that some
copies have, “for Thou shalt inherit among all nations.” This too may be
understood agreeably to the sense, nor does anything prevent both
meanings existing at once. His inheritance takes place by love, which in
that He cultivates by His commands and gracious mercy, He destroys
earthly desires.
