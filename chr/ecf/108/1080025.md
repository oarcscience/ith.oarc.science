<span id="ii.XXI-p1"></span> <span id="ii.XXI-p1.1"></span><span
class="c20"><span id="ii.XXI-p1.2"></span>Psalm XXI. <span
id="fr_583"></span>[584](#fn_583) </span>

<span id="ii.XXI-p3"></span>To the end, a psalm of David himself.

<span id="ii.XXI-p4"></span>1. The title is a familiar one; the Psalm is
of Christ. <span id="fr_584"></span>[585](#fn_584)

<span id="ii.XXI-p6"></span>2. “O Lord, the King shall rejoice in Thy
strength” ([Psa. 21.1](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#001)<span
id="ii.XXI-p6.1"></span>). O Lord, in Thy strength, whereby the Word was
made flesh, the Man Christ Jesus shall rejoice. “And shall exult
exceedingly in Thy salvation.” And in that, whereby Thou quickenest all
things, shall exult exceedingly.

<span id="ii.XXI-p7"></span>3. “Thou hast given Him the desire of His
soul” ([Psa. 21.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#002)<span
id="ii.XXI-p7.1"></span>). He desired to eat the Passover, <span
id="fr_585"></span>[586](#fn_585) and to lay down His life when He
would, and again when He would to take it; and Thou hast given it to
Him. <span id="fr_586"></span>[587](#fn_586) “And hast not deprived Him
of the good pleasure of His lips.” “My peace,” saith He, “I leave with
you:” <span id="fr_587"></span>[588](#fn_587) and it was done.

<span id="ii.XXI-p11"></span>4. “For Thou hast presented Him with the
blessings of sweetness” ([Psa.
21.3](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#003)<span id="ii.XXI-p11.1"></span>).
Because He had first quaffed the blessing of Thy sweetness, the gall of
our sins did not hurt Him. “*Diapsalma*. Thou hast set a crown of
precious stone on His Head.” <span id="fr_588"></span>[589](#fn_588) At
the beginning of His discoursing precious stones were brought, and
compassed Him about; <span id="fr_589"></span>[590](#fn_589) His
disciples, from whom the commencement of His preaching should be made.

<span id="ii.XXI-p14"></span>5. “He asked life; and Thou gavest Him:” He
asked a resurrection, saying, “Father, glorify Thy Son;” <span
id="fr_590"></span>[591](#fn_590) and Thou gavest it Him, “Length of
days for ever and ever” ([Psa.
21.4](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#004)<span id="ii.XXI-p15.2"></span>).
The prolonged ages of this world which the Church was to have, and after
them an eternity, world without end.

<span id="ii.XXI-p16"></span>6. “His glory is great in Thy salvation”
([Psa. 21.5](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#005)<span
id="ii.XXI-p16.1"></span>). Great indeed is His glory in the salvation,
whereby Thou hast raised Him up again. “Glory and great honour shalt
Thou lay upon Him.” But Thou shalt yet add unto Him glory and great
honour, when Thou shalt place Him in heaven at Thy right hand.

<span id="ii.XXI-p17"></span>7. “For Thou shalt give Him blessing for
ever and ever.” This is the blessing which Thou shalt give Him for ever
and ever: “Thou shalt make Him glad in joy together with Thy
countenance” ([Psa. 21.6](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#006)<span
id="ii.XXI-p17.1"></span>). According to His manhood, Thou shalt make
Him glad together with Thy countenance, which He lifted up to Thee.

<span id="ii.XXI-p18"></span>8. “For the King hopeth in the Lord.” For
the King is not proud, but humble in heart, he hopeth in the Lord. “And
in the mercy of the Most Highest He shall not be moved” ([Psa.
21.7](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#007)<span id="ii.XXI-p18.1"></span>).
And in the mercy of the Most Highest His obedience even unto the death
of the Cross shall not disturb His humility.

<span id="ii.XXI-p19"></span>9. “Let Thy hand be found by all Thine
enemies.” Be Thy power, O King, when Thou comest to judgment, found by
all Thine enemies; who in Thy humiliation discerned it not. “Let Thy
right hand find out all that hate Thee” ([Psa.
21.8](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#008)<span id="ii.XXI-p19.1"></span>).
Let the glory, wherein Thou reignest at the right hand of the Father,
find out for punishment in the day of judgment all that hate Thee; for
that now they have not found it.

<span id="ii.XXI-p20"></span>10. “Thou shalt make them like a fiery
oven:” Thou shalt make them on fire within, by the consciousness of
their ungodliness: “In the time of Thy countenance:” in the time of Thy
manifestation. “The Lord shall trouble them in His wrath, and the fire
shall devour them” ([Psa. 21.9](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#009)<span
id="ii.XXI-p20.1"></span>). And then, being troubled by the vengeance of
the Lord, after the accusation of their conscience, they shall be given
up to eternal fire, to be devoured.

<span id="ii.XXI-p21"></span>11. “Their fruit shalt Thou destroy out of
the earth.” Their fruit, because it is earthly, shalt Thou destroy out
of the earth. “And their seed from the sons of men” ([Psa.
21.10](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#010)<span id="ii.XXI-p21.1"></span>).
And their works; or, whomsoever they have seduced, Thou shalt not reckon
among the sons of men, whom Thou hast called into the everlasting
inheritance.

<span id="ii.XXI-p22"></span>12. “Because they turned evils against
Thee.” Now this punishment shall be recompensed to them, because the
evils which they supposed to hang over them by Thy reign, they turned
against Thee to Thy death. “They imagined a <span id="page_58">p.
58</span> <span id="ii.XXI-Page_58"></span>device, which they were not
able to establish” ([Psa. 21.11](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#011)<span
id="ii.XXI-p22.1"></span>). They imagined a device, saying, “It is
expedient that one die for all:” <span id="fr_591"></span>[592](#fn_591)
which they were not able to establish, not knowing what they said.

<span id="ii.XXI-p24"></span>13. “For Thou shalt set them low.” For Thou
shalt rank them among those from whom in degradation and contempt Thou
wilt turn away. “In Thy leavings <span id="fr_592"></span>[593](#fn_592)
Thou shalt make ready their countenance” ([Psa.
21.12](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#012)<span id="ii.XXI-p25.1"></span>).
And in these things that Thou leavest, that is, in the desires of an
earthly kingdom, Thou shalt make ready their shamelessness for Thy
passion.

<span id="ii.XXI-p26"></span>14. “Be Thou exalted, O Lord, in Thy
strength” ([Psa. 21.13](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#013)<span
id="ii.XXI-p26.1"></span>). Be Thou, Lord, whom in humiliation they did
not discern, exalted in Thy strength, which they thought weakness. “We
will sing and praise Thy power.” In heart and in deed we will celebrate
and make known Thy marvels.
