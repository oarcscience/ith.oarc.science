<span id="ii.L-p1"></span> <span id="ii.L-p1.1"></span><span
class="c20"><span id="ii.L-p1.2"></span>Psalm L. <span
id="fr_1674"></span>[1675](#fn_1674.md) </span>

<span id="ii.L-p3"></span>1. How much availeth the Word of God to us for
the correction of our life, both regarding His rewards to be expected,
and His punishments to be feared, let each one measure <span
id="fr_1675"></span>[1676](#fn_1675.md) in himself; and let him put his
conscience without deceit before His eyes, and not flatter himself in a
danger so great: for ye see that even our Lord God Himself doth flatter
no one: though He comforteth us by promising His blessings, and by
strengthening our hope; yet them that live ill and despise His word He
assuredly spareth not. Let each one examine himself, while it is time,
and let him see where he is, and either persevere in good, or be changed
from evil. For as he saith in this Psalm, not any man whatever nor any
angel whatever, but, “The Lord, the God of gods, hath spoken” ([Psa.
50.1](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#001)<span id="ii.L-p4.2"></span>.md). But
in speaking, He hath done what? “He hath called the earth from the
rising of the sun unto the going down.” He that “hath called the world
from the rising of the sun unto the going down,” is Our Lord and Saviour
Jesus Christ, “the Word made Flesh,” <span
id="fr_1676"></span>[1677](#fn_1676.md) in order that He might dwell in us.
Our Lord Jesus Christ then <span id="page_178">p. 178</span> <span
id="ii.L-Page_178"></span>is the “God of gods;” because by Himself were
all things made, and without Himself was nothing made. The Word of God,
if He is God, is truly the God of gods; but whether He be God the Gospel
answereth, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God,
and the Word was God.” <span id="fr_1677"></span>[1678](#fn_1677.md) And if
all things were made by Himself, as He saith in the sequel, then if any
were made gods, by Himself were they made. For the one God was not made,
and He is Himself alone truly God. But Himself the only God, Father and
Son and Holy Ghost, is one God.

<span id="ii.L-p7"></span>2. But then who are those gods, or where are
they, of whom God is the true God? Another Psalm saith, “God hath stood
in the synagogue of gods, but in the midst He judgeth gods.” <span
id="fr_1678"></span>[1679](#fn_1678.md) As yet we know not whether
perchance any gods be congregated in heaven, and in their congregation,
for this is “in the synagogue,” God hath stood to judge. See in the same
Psalm those to whom he saith, “I have said, Ye are gods, and children of
the Highest all; but ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the
princes.” <span id="fr_1679"></span>[1680](#fn_1679.md) It is evident then,
that He hath called men gods, that are deified of His Grace, not born of
His Substance. For He doth justify, who is just through His own self,
and not of another; and He doth deify who is God through Himself, not by
the partaking of another. But He that justifieth doth Himself deify, in
that by justifying He doth make sons of God. “For He hath given them
power to become the sons of God.” <span
id="fr_1680"></span>[1681](#fn_1680.md) If we have been made sons of God,
we have also been made gods: but this is the effect of Grace adopting,
not of nature generating. For the only Son of God, God, and one God with
the Father, Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, was in the beginning the
Word, and the Word with God, the Word God. The rest that are made gods,
are made by His own Grace, are not born of His Substance, that they
should be the same as He, but that by favour they should come to Him,
and be fellow-heirs with Christ. For so great is the love in Him the
Heir, that He hath willed to have fellow-heirs. What covetous man would
will this, to have fellow-heirs? But even one that is found so to will,
will share with them the inheritance, the sharer having less himself,
than if he had possessed alone: but the inheritance wherein we are
fellow-heirs of Christ, is not lessened by multitude of possessors, nor
is it made narrower by the number of fellow-heirs: but is as great for
many as it is for few, as great for individuals as for all. “See,” saith
the Apostle, “what love God hath bestowed upon us, that we should be
called, and be, the sons of God.” <span
id="fr_1681"></span>[1682](#fn_1681.md) And in another place, “Dearly
beloved, we are the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we
shall be.” We are therefore in hope, not yet in substance. “But we
know,” he saith, “that when He shall have appeared, we shall be like
Him, for we shall see Him as He is.” <span
id="fr_1682"></span>[1683](#fn_1682.md) The Only Son is like Him by birth,
we like by seeing. For we are not like in such sort as He, who is the
same as He is by whom He was begotten: for we are like, not equal: He,
because equal, is therefore like. We have heard who are the gods that
being made are justified, because they are called the sons of God: and
who are the gods that are not Gods, to whom the God of gods is terrible?
For another Psalm saith, “He is terrible over all gods.”  <span
id="fr_1683"></span>[1684](#fn_1683.md) And as if thou shouldest enquire,
what gods? He saith, “For all the gods of the nations are devils.” To
the gods of the nations, to the devils, terrible: to the gods made by
Himself, to sons, lovely. Furthermore, I find both of them confessing
the Majesty of God, both the devils confessed Christ, and the faithful
confessed Christ. “Thou art Christ, the Son of the living God,” <span
id="fr_1684"></span>[1685](#fn_1684.md) said Peter. “We know who Thou art,
Thou art the Son of God,” <span id="fr_1685"></span>[1686](#fn_1685.md)
said the devils. A like confession I hear, but like love I find not; nay
even here love, there fear. To whom therefore He is lovely, the same are
sons; to whom He is terrible, are not sons; to whom He is lovely, the
same He hath made gods; those to whom He is terrible He doth prove not
to be gods. For these are made gods, those are reputed gods; these Truth
maketh gods, those error doth so account.

<span id="ii.L-p16"></span>3. “The God,” therefore, “of gods, the Lord
hath spoken” <span id="fr_1686"></span>[1687](#fn_1686.md) ([Psa.
50.1](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#001)<span id="ii.L-p17.2"></span>.md).
Hath spoken many ways. By Angels He hath Himself spoken, by Prophets He
hath Himself spoken, by His own mouth He hath Himself spoken, by His
faithful He doth Himself speak, by our lowliness, when we say anything
true, He doth Himself speak. See then, by speaking diversely, many ways,
by many vessels, by many instruments, yet He doth Himself sound
everywhere, by touching, moulding, inspiring: see what He hath done. For
“He hath spoken, and hath called the world.” What world? Africa,
perhaps! for the sake of those that say, the Church of Christ is the
portion of Donatus. Africa indeed alone He hath not called, but even
Africa He hath not severed. For He that “hath called the world from the
rising of the sun unto the going down,” leaving out no parts that He
hath not called, in His calling hath found Africa. Let it rejoice
therefore in unity, not pride itself in division. We say well, that the
voice of the God of gods hath come even into Africa, hath not stayed in
Africa. <span id="page_179">p. 179</span> <span
id="ii.L-Page_179"></span>For “He hath called the world from the rising
of the sun unto the going down.” There is no place where may lurk the
conspiracies of heretics, they have no place wherein they may hide
themselves under the shadow of falsehood; for “there is none that can
hide himself from the heat thereof.” <span
id="fr_1687"></span>[1688](#fn_1687.md) He that hath called the world, hath
called even the whole world: He that hath called the world, hath called
as much as He hath formed. Why do false christs and false prophets rise
up against me? why is it that they strive to ensnare me with captious
words, saying, “Lo! here is Christ, Lo! He is there!” <span
id="fr_1688"></span>[1689](#fn_1688.md) I hear not them that point out
portions: the God of gods hath pointed out the whole: “He” that “hath
called the world from the rising of the sun unto the going down,” hath
redeemed the whole; but hath condemned them that lay false claim
to <span id="fr_1689"></span>[1690](#fn_1689.md) portions.

<span id="ii.L-p21"></span>4. But we have heard the world called from
the rising of the sun unto the going down: whence doth He begin to call,
who hath called? This thing also hear ye: “Out of Sion is the semblance
of His beauty” ([Psa. 50.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#002.md)<span
id="ii.L-p21.1"></span>). Evidently the Psalm doth agree with the
Gospel, which saith, “Throughout all nations, beginning at
Jerusalem.” <span id="fr_1690"></span>[1691](#fn_1690.md) Hear, “Throughout
all nations:” He hath called the world from the rising of the sun unto
the going down.” Hear, “Beginning at Jerusalem:” “Out of Sion is the
semblance of His beauty.” Therefore, “He hath called the world from the
rising of the sun unto the going down,” agreeth with the words of the
Lord, who saith, “It behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead
the third day; and that repentance and remission of sins should be
preached in His Name throughout all nations.” <span
id="fr_1691"></span>[1692](#fn_1691.md) For all nations are from the rising
of the sun unto the going down. But that, “Out of Sion is the semblance
of His beauty,” that thence beginneth the beauty of His Gospel, that
thence He began to be preached, being “beautiful in form beyond the sons
of men,” <span id="fr_1692"></span>[1693](#fn_1692.md) agreeth with the
words of the Lord, who saith, “Beginning at Jerusalem.” New things are
in tune with old, old things with new: the two Seraphim say to one
another, “Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Sabaoth.” <span
id="fr_1693"></span>[1694](#fn_1693.md) The two Testaments are both in
tune, and the two Testaments have one voice: let the voice of the
Testaments in tune be heard, not that of pretenders disinherited. This
thing then hath the God of gods done, “He hath called the world from the
rising of the sun unto the going down, His semblance going before out of
Sion.” For in that place were His disciples, <span
id="fr_1694"></span>[1695](#fn_1694.md) who received the Holy Ghost sent
from heaven on the fiftieth day after His resurrection. Thence the
Gospel, thence the preaching, thence the whole world filled, and that in
the Grace of Faith.

<span id="ii.L-p27"></span>5. For when the Lord Himself had come,
because He came to suffer, He came hidden: and though He was strong in
Himself, He appeared in the flesh weak. For He must needs appear in
order that He might not be perceived; be despised, in order that He
might be slain. There was semblance of glory in divinity, but it lay
concealed in flesh. “For if they had known, they would never have
crucified the Lord of glory.” <span id="fr_1695"></span>[1696](#fn_1695.md)
So then He walked hidden among the Jews, among His enemies, doing
marvels, suffering ills, until He was hanged on the tree, and the Jews
seeing Him hanging both despised Him the more, and before the Cross
wagging their heads they said, “If He be the Son of God, let Him come
down from the Cross.” <span id="fr_1696"></span>[1697](#fn_1696.md) Hidden
then was the God of gods, and He gave forth words more out of compassion
for us than out of His own majesty. For whence, unless assumed from us,
were those words, “My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken me?” <span
id="fr_1697"></span>[1698](#fn_1697.md) But when hath the Father forsaken
the Son, or the Son the Father? Are not Father and Son one God? Whence
then, “My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me,” save that in the
Flesh of infirmity there was acknowledged the voice of a sinner? For as
He took upon Him the likeness of the flesh of sin, <span
id="fr_1698"></span>[1699](#fn_1698.md) why should He not take upon Him the
voice of sin? Hidden then was the God of gods, both when He walked among
men, and when He hungered, and when He thirsted, and when fatigued He
sat, and when with wearied body He slept, and when taken, and when
scourged, and when standing before the judge, and when He made answer to
him in his pride, “Thou couldest have no power against Me, except it had
been given thee from above;” <span id="fr_1699"></span>[1700](#fn_1699.md)
and while led as a victim “before His shearer He opened not His
mouth,” <span id="fr_1700"></span>[1701](#fn_1700.md) and while crucified,
and while buried, He was always hidden God of gods. What took place
after He rose again? The disciples marvelled, and at first believed not,
until they touched and handled. <span
id="fr_1701"></span>[1702](#fn_1701.md) But flesh had risen, because flesh
had been dead: Divinity which could not die, even still lay hid in the
flesh of Him rising. Form could be seen, limbs held, scars handled: the
Word by whom all things were made, who doth see? who doth hold? who doth
handle? And yet “the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us.” <span
id="fr_1702"></span>[1703](#fn_1702.md) And Thomas, that was holding Man,
understood God as he was able. For when he had handled the scars, he
cried out, <span id="page_180">p. 180</span> <span
id="ii.L-Page_180"></span>“My Lord, and my God.” Yet the Lord was
showing that form, and that flesh, which they had seen upon the Cross,
which had been laid in the sepulchre. He stayed with them forty
days.…But what was said to Thomas handling? “Because thou hast seen,
thou hast believed; blessed are they that see not, and believe.”  <span
id="fr_1703"></span>[1704](#fn_1703.md) We are foretold. That world called
from the rising of the sun unto the going down seeth not, and believeth.
Hidden then is the God of gods, both to those among whom He walked, and
to those by whom He was crucified, and to those before whose eyes He
rose, and to us who believe on Him in heaven sitting, whom we have not
seen on earth walking. But even if we were to see, should we not see
that which the Jews saw and crucified? It is more, that not seeing we
believe Christ to be God, than that they seeing deemed Him only to be
man. They in a word by thinking evil slew, we by believing well are made
alive.

<span id="ii.L-p37"></span>6. What then, brethren? This God of gods,
both then hidden, and now hidden, shall He ever be hidden? Evidently
not: hear what followeth: “God shall come manifest” ([Psa.
50.3](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#003)<span id="ii.L-p37.1"></span>.md). He
that came hidden, shall come manifest. Hidden He came to be judged,
manifest He shall come to judge: hidden He came that He might stand
before a judge, manifest He shall come that He may be judge even of
judges: “He shall come manifest, and shall not be silent.” But why? Is
He now silent? And whence are all the words that we say? whence those
precepts? whence those warnings? whence that trumpet of terror? He is
not silent, and is silent: is not silent from warning, is silent from
avenging: is not silent from precept, is silent from judgment. For He
suffereth sinners daily doing evil things, not caring for God, not in
their conscience, not in heaven, not in earth: all these things escape
Him not, and universally He doth admonish all; and whenever He
chastiseth any on earth, it is admonition, not yet condemnation. He is
silent then from judgment, He is hidden in heaven, as yet He intercedeth
for us: He is long-suffering to sinners, not putting forth His wrath,
but awaiting penitence. He saith in another place: “I have held my
peace, shall I always hold my peace?” <span
id="fr_1704"></span>[1705](#fn_1704.md) When then He shall not hold His
peace, “God shall come manifest.” What God? “Our God.” And the God
Himself, who is our God: for he is not God, who is not our God. For the
gods of the nations are devils: the God of Christians is very God.
Himself shall come, but “manifest,” not still to be mocked, not still to
be buffeted and scourged: He shall come, but “manifest,” not still to be
smitten with a reed upon the head, not still to be crucified, slain,
buried: for all these things God being hidden hath willed to suffer. “He
shall come manifest, and shall not be silent.”

<span id="ii.L-p39"></span>7. But that He shall come to judgment, the
following words teach. “Fire shall go before Him.” <span
id="fr_1705"></span>[1706](#fn_1705.md) Do we fear? Be we changed, and we
shall not fear. Let chaff fear the fire: what doth it to gold? What thou
mayest do is now in thy power, so thou mayest not experience, for want
of being corrected, that which is to come even against thy will. For if
we might so bring it about, brethren, that the day of judgment should
not come; I think that even then it were not for us to live ill. If the
fire of the day of judgment were not to come, and over sinners there
impended only separation from the face of God, in whatever affluence of
delights they might be, not seeing Him by whom they were created, and
separated from that sweetness of His ineffable <span
id="fr_1706"></span>[1707](#fn_1706.md) countenance, in whatever eternity
and impunity of sin, they ought to bemoan themselves. But what shall I
say, or to whom shall I say? This is a punishment to lovers, not to
despisers. They that have begun to feel in any degree the sweetness of
wisdom and truth, know what I say, how great a punishment it is to be
only separated from the face of God: but they that have not tasted that
sweetness, if not yet they yearn for the face of God, let them fear even
fire; let punishments terrify those, whom rewards win not. Of no value
to thee is what God promiseth, tremble at what He threateneth. The
sweetness of His presence shall come; thou art not changed, thou art not
awakened, thou sighest not, thou longest not: thou embracest thy sins
and the delights of thy flesh, thou art heaping stubble to thyself, the
fire will come. “Fire shall burn in His presence.” This fire will not be
like thy hearth-fire, into which nevertheless, if thou art compelled to
thrust thy hand, thou wilt do whatsoever he would have thee who doth
threaten this alternative. If he say to thee, “write against the
life <span id="fr_1707"></span>[1708](#fn_1707.md) of thy father, write
against the lives of thy children, for if thou do not, I thrust thy hand
into thy fire:” thou wilt do it in order that thy hand be not burned, in
order that thy member be not burned for a time, though it is not to be
ever in pain. Thine enemy threateneth then but so light an evil, and
thou doest evil; God threateneth eternal evil, and doest thou not good?
To do evil not even menaces should compel thee: from doing good not even
menaces should deter thee. But by the menaces of God, by menaces of
everlasting fire, thou art dissuaded from evil, invited to good.
Wherefore doth it grieve thee, except because thou believest not? Let
each one then <span id="page_181">p. 181</span> <span
id="ii.L-Page_181"></span>examine his heart, and see what faith
doth <span id="fr_1708"></span>[1709](#fn_1708.md) hold there. If we
believe a judgment to come, brethren, let us live well. Now is time of
mercy, then will be time of judgment. No one will say, “Call me back to
my former years.” Even then men will repent, but will repent in vain:
now let there be repentance, while there is fruit of repentance; now let
there be applied to the roots of the tree a basket of dung, <span
id="fr_1709"></span>[1710](#fn_1709.md) sorrow of heart, and tears; lest He
come and pluck up by the roots. For when He shall have plucked up, then
the fire is to be looked for. Now, even if the branches have been
broken, they can again be grafted in: <span
id="fr_1710"></span>[1711](#fn_1710.md) then, “every tree which bringeth
not forth good fruit, shall be cut down, and shall be cast into the
fire.” <span id="fr_1711"></span>[1712](#fn_1711.md) “Fire shall burn in
His presence.”

<span id="ii.L-p47"></span>8. “And a mighty tempest round about Him”
([Psa. 50.3](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#003.md)<span
id="ii.L-p47.1"></span>). “A mighty tempest,” in order to winnow so
great a floor. In this tempest shall be that winnowing whereby from the
saints shall be put away everything impure, from the faithful every
unreality; from godly men and them that fear the Word of God, every
scorner and every proud man. For now a sort of mixture doth lie there,
from the rising of the sun unto the going down. Let us see then how He
will do that is to come, what He will do with that tempest which “shall
be a mighty tempest round about Him.” Doubtless this tempest is to make
a sort of separation. It is that separation which they waited not for,
who brake the nets, before they came to land. <span
id="fr_1712"></span>[1713](#fn_1712.md) But in this separation there is
made a sort of distinction between good men and bad men. There be some
that now follow Christ with lightened shoulders without the load of the
world’s cares, who have not heard in vain, “If thou wilt be perfect, go
and sell all that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have
treasure in heaven: and come, follow Me;” <span
id="fr_1713"></span>[1714](#fn_1713.md) to which sort is said, “Ye shall
sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.” <span
id="fr_1714"></span>[1715](#fn_1714.md) Some then shall be judging with the
Lord: but others to be judged, but to be placed on the right hand. For
that there will be certain judging with the Lord, we have most evident
testimony, which I have but now quoted: “Ye shall sit upon twelve
thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.”…

<span id="ii.L-p51"></span>9. But what the Lord did after His
resurrection, signified what is to be to us after our resurrection, in
that number of the kingdom of heaven, where shall be no bad man.…Lastly,
those seven thousand of whom reply was made to Elias, “I have left me
seven thousand men that have not bowed knees before Baal,” <span
id="fr_1715"></span>[1716](#fn_1715.md) far exceed that number of fishes.
Therefore the hundred and fifty-three fishes <span
id="fr_1716"></span>[1717](#fn_1716.md) doth not alone express just such a
number of saints, but Scripture doth express the whole number of saints
and righteous men by so great a number for a particular reason; to wit,
in order that in those hundred and fifty-three all may be understood
that pertain to the resurrection to eternal life. For the Law hath ten
commandments: <span id="fr_1717"></span>[1718](#fn_1717.md) but the Spirit
of Grace, through which alone the Law is fulfilled, <span
id="fr_1718"></span>[1719](#fn_1718.md) is called sevenfold. The number
then must be examined, what mean ten and seven: ten in commandments,
seven in the grace of the Holy Spirit: by which grace the commandments
are fulfilled. Ten then and seven contain all that pertain to the
resurrection, to the right hand, to the kingdom of heaven, to life
eternal, that is, they that fulfil the Law by the Grace of the Spirit,
not as it were by their own work or their own merit. But ten and seven,
if thou countest from one unto seventeen, by adding all the numbers by
steps, so that to one thou mayest add two, add three, add four, that
they may become ten, by adding five that they may become fifteen, by
adding six that they may become twenty-one, by adding seven that they
may become twenty-eight, by adding eight that they may become
thirty-six, by adding nine that they may become forty-five, by adding
ten that they may become fifty-five, by adding eleven that they may
become sixty-six, by adding twelve that they may become seventy-eight,
by adding thirteen that they may become ninety-one, by adding fourteen
that they may become one hundred and five, by adding fifteen that they
may become one hundred and twenty, by adding sixteen that they may
become one hundred and thirty-six, by adding seventeen, make up one
hundred and fifty-three, thou wilt find a vast number of all saints to
belong to this number of a few fishes. In like manner then as in five
virgins, countless virgins; as in five brethren of him that was
tormented in hell, thousands of the people of the Jews; as in the number
of one hundred and fifty-three fishes, thousands of thousands of saints:
so in twelve thrones, not twelve men, but great is the number of the
perfect. <span id="fr_1719"></span>[1720](#fn_1719.md)

<span id="ii.L-p57"></span>10. But I see what is next required of us; in
like manner as in the case of the five virgins, a reason was given why
many should belong to five, and why to those five many Jews, and why to
a hundred and fifty-three many perfect—to show why and how to the twelve
thrones not twelve men, but many belong. What mean the twelve thrones,
which signify all men every<span id="page_182">p. 182</span> <span
id="ii.L-Page_182"></span>where that have been enabled to be so perfect
as they must be perfect, to whom it is said, “Ye shall sit over the
twelve tribes of Israel”? <span id="fr_1720"></span>[1721](#fn_1720.md) And
why do all men everywhere belong to the number twelve? Because the very
“everywhere” which we say, we say of the whole world: but the compass of
lands is contained in four particular quarters, East, West, South, and
North: from all these quarters they being called in the Trinity and made
perfect in the faith and precept of the Trinity,—seeing that three times
four are twelve, ye perceive wherefore the saints belong to the whole
world; they that shall sit upon twelve thrones to judge the twelve
tribes of Israel, since the twelve tribes of Israel, also, are the
twelve tribes of the whole of Israel. For like as they that are to judge
are from the whole world, so also they that are to be judged are from
the whole world. The Apostle Paul of himself, when he was reproving
believing laymen, because they referred not their causes to the Church,
but dragged them with whom they had matters before the public, said,
“Know ye not that we shall judge Angels?”  <span
id="fr_1721"></span>[1722](#fn_1721.md) See after what sort He hath made
Himself judge: not only himself, but also all that judge aright in the
Church.

<span id="ii.L-p60"></span>11. Since then it is evident, that many are
to judge with the Lord, but that others are to be judged, not however on
equality, but according to their deserts; He will come with all His
Angels, <span id="fr_1722"></span>[1723](#fn_1722.md) when before Him shall
be gathered all nations, and among all the Angels are to be reckoned
those that have been made so perfect, that sitting upon twelve thrones
they judge the twelve tribes of Israel. For men are called Angels: the
Apostle saith of himself, “As an angel of God ye received me.” <span
id="fr_1723"></span>[1724](#fn_1723.md) Of John Baptist it is said,
“Behold, I send My Angel before Thy face, that shall prepare Thy way
before Thee.” <span id="fr_1724"></span>[1725](#fn_1724.md) Therefore,
coming with all Angels, together with Him He shall have the Saints also.
For plainly saith Isaias also, “He shall come to judgment with the
elders of the people.” <span id="fr_1725"></span>[1726](#fn_1725.md) Those
“elders of the people,” then, those but now named Angels, those
thousands of many men made perfect coming from the whole world, are
called Heaven. But the others *are called* earth, yet fruitful. Which is
the earth that is fruitful? That which is to be set on the right hand,
unto which it shall be said, “I was an hungred, and ye gave Me to
eat:” <span id="fr_1726"></span>[1727](#fn_1726.md) truly fruitful earth in
which the Apostle doth joy, when they sent to him to supply his
necessities: “Not because I ask a gift,” he saith, “but I require
fruit.” <span id="fr_1727"></span>[1728](#fn_1727.md) And he giveth thanks,
saying, “Because at length ye have budded forth again to be thoughtful
for me.” <span id="fr_1728"></span>[1729](#fn_1728.md) He saith, “Ye have
budded forth again,” as to trees which had withered away with a kind of
barrenness. Therefore the Lord coming to judgment (that we may now hear
the Psalm, brethren), He will do what? “He will call the heaven from
above” ([Psa. 50.4](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#004.md)<span
id="ii.L-p67.2"></span>). The heaven, all the Saints, those made perfect
that shall judge, them He shall call from above, to be sitters with Him
to judge the twelve tribes of Israel. For how shall “He call the heaven
from above,” when the heaven is always above? But those that He here
calleth heaven, the same elsewhere He calleth heavens. What heavens?
That tell out the glory of God: for, “The heavens tell out the glory of
God:” <span id="fr_1729"></span>[1730](#fn_1729.md) whereof is said, “Into
all the earth their sound hath gone forth, and into the ends of the
world their words.” For see the Lord severing in judgment: “He shall
call the heaven from above and the earth, to sever His people.” From
whom but from evil men? Of whom here afterwards no mention is made, now
as it were condemned to punishment. See these good men, and distinguish.
“He shall call the heaven from above, and the earth, to sever His
people.” He calleth the earth also, not however to be associated, but to
be dissociated. For at first He called them together, “when the God of
gods spake and called the world from the rising of the sun unto the
going down,” He had not yet severed: those servants had been sent to bid
to the marriage, <span id="fr_1730"></span>[1731](#fn_1730.md) who had
gathered good and bad. But when the God of gods shall come manifest and
shall not keep silence, He shall so call the “heaven from above” that it
may judge with Him. For what the heaven is, the heavens themselves are;
just as what the earth is, the lands themselves, just as what the Church
is, the Churches themselves: “He shall call the heaven from above, and
the earth, to sever His people.” Now with the heaven He severeth the
earth, that is, the heaven with Him doth sever the earth. How doth He
sever the earth? In such sort that He setteth on the right hand some,
others on the left. But to the earth severed, He saith what? “Come, ye
blessed of My Father, receive the kingdom which was prepared for you
from the beginning of the world. For I was an hungred, and ye gave me to
eat,” and so forth. But they say, “When saw we Thee an hungred?” And He,
“Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of Mine, ye have done
it unto Me.”  <span id="fr_1731"></span>[1732](#fn_1731.md) “He shall call
therefore the heaven from above, and the earth, to sever His people.”

<span id="ii.L-p71"></span>12. “Gather to Him His righteous” ([Psa.
50.5](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#005)<span id="ii.L-p71.1"></span>.md).
The voice divine and prophetic, seeing future things as if present doth
exhort the Angels gathering. For He shall send His Angels, and before
<span id="page_183">p. 183</span> <span id="ii.L-Page_183"></span>Him
shall be gathered all nations. <span
id="fr_1732"></span>[1733](#fn_1732.md) Gather to Him His righteous. What
righteous men save those that live of faith and do works of mercy? For
those works are works of righteousness. Thou hast the Gospel: “Beware of
doing your righteousness before men to be seen of them.” <span
id="fr_1733"></span>[1734](#fn_1733.md) And as if it were inquired, What
righteousness? “When therefore thou doest alms,” He saith. Therefore
alms He hath signified to be works of righteousness. Those very persons
gather for His righteous: gather those that have had compassion on the
“needy,” that have considered the needy and poor: <span
id="fr_1734"></span>[1735](#fn_1734.md) gather them, “The Lord preserve
them, and make them to live;” “Gather to Him His righteous: who order
His covenant above sacrifices:” that is, who think of His promises above
those things which they work. For those things are sacrifices, God
saying, “I will have mercy more than sacrifice.” <span
id="fr_1735"></span>[1736](#fn_1735.md) “Who keep His covenant more than
sacrifice.”

<span id="ii.L-p76"></span>13. “And the Heaven shall declare His
righteousness” ([Psa. 50.6](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#006.md)<span
id="ii.L-p76.1"></span>). Truly this righteousness of God to us the
“heavens have declared,” the Evangelists have foretold. Through them we
have heard that some will be on the right hand, to whom the Householder
saith, “Come, ye blessed of My Father, receive.” <span
id="fr_1736"></span>[1737](#fn_1736.md) Receive what? “A kingdom.” In
return for what thing? “I was an hungred, and ye gave Me to eat.” What
so valueless, what so earthly, as to break bread to the hungry? At so
much is valued the kingdom of heaven. “Break thy bread to the hungry,
and the needy without covering bring into thy house; if thou seest one
naked, clothe him.” <span id="fr_1737"></span>[1738](#fn_1737.md) If thou
hast not the means of breaking bread, hast not house into which thou
mayest bring, hast not garment wherewith thou mayest cover: give a cup
of cold water, <span id="fr_1738"></span>[1739](#fn_1738.md) cast two mites
into the treasury. <span id="fr_1739"></span>[1740](#fn_1739.md) As much
the widow doth buy with two mites, as Peter buyeth, by leaving the
nets, <span id="fr_1740"></span>[1741](#fn_1740.md) as Zacchæus buyeth by
giving half his goods. <span id="fr_1741"></span>[1742](#fn_1741.md) Of so
much worth is all that thou hast. “The heavens shall declare His
righteousness, for God is Judge.” Truly judge not confounding but
severing. For “the Lord knoweth them that are His.” <span
id="fr_1742"></span>[1743](#fn_1742.md) Even if grains lie hid in the
chaff, they are known to the husbandman. Let no one fear that he is a
grain even among the chaff; the eyes of our winnower are not deceived.
Fear not lest that tempest, which shall be round about Him, should
confound thee with chaff. Certainly mighty will be the tempest; yet not
one grain will it sweep from the side of the corn to the chaff: because
not any rustic with three-pronged fork, but God, Three in One, is Judge.
And the heavens shall declare His righteousness: for God is Judge. Let
heavens go, let the heavens tell, into every land let their sound go
out, and unto the ends of the world their words: <span
id="fr_1743"></span>[1744](#fn_1743.md) and let that body say, “From the
ends of the world unto Thee have I cried, when my heart was in
heaviness.” <span id="fr_1744"></span>[1745](#fn_1744.md) For now mingled
it groaneth, divided it shall rejoice. Let it cry then and say, “Destroy
not my soul with ungodly men, and with men of blood my life.” <span
id="fr_1745"></span>[1746](#fn_1745.md) He destroyeth not together, because
God is Judge. Let it cry to Him and say, “Judge me, O Lord, and sever my
cause from the nation unholy:” <span
id="fr_1746"></span>[1747](#fn_1746.md) let it say, He shall do it: there
shall be gathered to Him His righteous ones. He hath called the earth
that He may sever His people.

<span id="ii.L-p88"></span>14. “Hear, my people, and I will speak to
thee” ([Psa. 50.7](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#007.md)<span
id="ii.L-p88.1"></span>). He shall come and shall not keep silence; see
how that even now, if ye hear, He is not silent. Hear, my people, and I
will speak to thee. For if thou hearest not, I will not speak to thee.
“Hear, and I will speak to thee.” For if thou hearest not, even though I
shall speak, it will not be to thee. When then shall I speak to thee? If
thou hearest. When hearest thou? If thou art my people. For, “Hear, my
people:” thou hearest not if thou art an alien people. “Hear, my people,
and I will speak to thee: Israel, and I will testify to thee.”…For “Thy
God,” is properly said to that man whom God doth keep more as one of His
family, as though in His household, as though in His peculiar: “Thy God
am I.” What wilt thou more? Requirest thou a reward from God, so that
God may give thee something; so that what He hath given thee may be
thine own? Behold God Himself, who shall give, is thine own. What richer
than He? Gifts thou wast desiring, thou hast the Giver Himself. “God,
thy God, I am.”

<span id="ii.L-p89"></span>15. What He requireth of man, let us see;
what tribute our God, our Emperor and our King doth enjoin us; since He
hath willed to be our King, and hath willed us to be His province? Let
us hear His injunctions. Let not a poor man tremble beneath the
injunction of God: what God enjoineth to be given to Himself, He doth
Himself first give that enjoineth: be ye only devoted. God doth not
exact what He hath not given, and to all men hath given what He doth
exact. For what doth He exact? Let us hear now: “I will not reprove thee
because of thy sacrifices” ([Psa.
50.8](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#008)<span id="ii.L-p89.1"></span>.md). I
will not say to thee, Wherefore hast thou not slain for me a fat bull?
why hast thou not selected the best he-goat from thy flock? Wherefore
doth that ram amble among thy sheep, and is not laid upon mine altar? I
will not say, Examine thy fields and thy pen <span
id="fr_1747"></span>[1748](#fn_1747.md) <span id="page_184">p. 184</span>
<span id="ii.L-Page_184"></span>and thy walls, seeking what thou mayest
give Me. “I will not reprove thee because of thy sacrifices.” What then:
Dost Thou not accept my sacrifices? “But thy holocausts are always in My
sight” ([Psa. 50.9](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#009.md)<span
id="ii.L-p90.1"></span>). Certain holocausts concerning which it is said
in another Psalm, “If Thou hadst desired sacrifice, I would surely have
given, with holocausts Thou wilt not be delighted:”  <span
id="fr_1748"></span>[1749](#fn_1748.md) and again he turneth himself,
“Sacrifice to God is a troubled spirit, a heart broken and humbled God
doth not despise.” <span id="fr_1749"></span>[1750](#fn_1749.md) Which be
then holocausts that He despiseth not? Which holocausts that are always
in His sight? “Kindly, O Lord,” he saith, “deal in Thy good will with
Sion, and be the walls of Jerusalem builded, then shalt Thou accept the
sacrifice of righteousness, oblations, and holocausts.” He saith that
certain holocausts God will accept. But what is a holocaust? A whole
consumed with fire: *causis* is burning, *holon* is whole: but a
“holocaust” is a whole consumed with fire. There is a certain fire of
most burning love: be the mind inflamed with love, let the same love
hurry off the limbs to its use, let it not allow them to serve cupidity,
in order that we may wholly glow with fire of divine love that will
offer to God a holocaust. Such “holocausts of thine are in My sight
always.”

<span id="ii.L-p93"></span>16. As yet that Israel perchance doth not
understand what are the holocausts thereof which He hath in His sight
always, and is still thinking of oxen, of sheep, of he-goats: let it not
so think: “I will not accept calves of thy house.” Holocausts I named;
at once in mind and thought to earthly flocks thou wast running,
therefrom thou wast selecting for Me some fat thing: “I will not accept
calves of thy house.” He is foretelling the New Testament, wherein all
those sacrifices have ceased. For they were then foretelling a certain
Sacrifice which was to be, with the Blood whereof we should be cleansed.
“I will not accept calves of thy house, nor he-goats of thy flocks.”

<span id="ii.L-p94"></span>17. “For mine are all the beasts of the wood”
([Psa. 50.10](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#010.md)<span
id="ii.L-p94.1"></span>). Why should I ask of thee what I have made? Is
it more thine, to whom I have given it to possess, than Mine, who have
made it? “For mine are all the beasts of the wood.” But perchance that
Israel saith, The beasts are God’s, those wild beasts which I enclose
not in my pen, which I bind not to my stall; but this ox and sheep and
he-goat—these are mine own. “Cattle on the mountain, and oxen.” <span
id="fr_1750"></span>[1751](#fn_1750.md) Mine are those which thou
possessest not, Mine are these which thou possessest. For if thou art My
servant, the whole of thy property is Mine. For it cannot be, that is
the property of the master which the servant hath gotten to himself, and
yet that not be the property of the Master which the Master Himself hath
created for the servant. Therefore Mine are the beasts of the wood which
thou hast not taken; Mine are also the cattle on the mountains which are
thine, and the oxen which are at thy stall: all are Mine own, for I have
created them.

<span id="ii.L-p96"></span>18. “I know all the winged creatures of
heaven” ([Psa. 50.11](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#011.md)<span
id="ii.L-p96.1"></span>). How doth He know? He hath weighed them, hath
counted. Which of us knoweth all the winged creatures of heaven? But
even though to some man God give knowledge of all the winged creatures
of heaven, He doth not Himself know in the same manner as He giveth man
to know. One thing is God’s knowledge, another man’s: in like manner as
there is one possession of God’s, another of man’s: that is, God’s
possessing is one thing, man’s another. For what thou possessest thou
hast not wholly in thy power, or else thy ox, so long as it liveth, is
in thy power; so as that it either die not, or be not to be fed. With
whom there is the highest power, there is highest and most secret
cognition. Let us ascribe this to God, while praising God. Let us not
dare to say, How knoweth God? Do not, I pray you, brethren, of me expect
this, that I should unfold to you, how God doth know: this only I say,
He doth not so know as a man, He doth not so know as an Angel: and how
He knoweth I dare not say, because also I cannot ken. One thing,
nevertheless, I ken, that even before all the winged creatures of heaven
were, God knew that which He was to create. What is that knowledge? O
man, thou beginnest to see, after that thou hadst been formed, after
that thou hadst received sense of seeing. These fowls sprung of the
water at the word of God, saying, “Let the waters bring forth
fowls.” <span id="fr_1751"></span>[1752](#fn_1751.md) Whereby did God know
the things which He commanded the water to bear forth? Now surely He
knew what He had created, and before He created He knew. So great then
is the knowledge of God, so that with Himself they were in a certain
ineffable manner before they were created: and of thee doth He expect to
receive what He had, before He created? “I know all the winged creatures
of heaven,” which thou to Me canst not give. The things which thou wast
about to slay for Me, I know all: not because I made I know, but in
order that I might make. “And the beauty of the field is with Me.” The
fairness of the field, the abundance of all things engendering upon
earth, “is with Me,” He saith. How with Him? Were they so, even before
they were made? Yea, for with Him were all things to come, and <span
id="page_185">p. 185</span> <span id="ii.L-Page_185"></span>with Him are
all things by-gone: things to come in such sort, that there be not
withdrawn from Him all things by-gone. With Him are all things by a
certain cognition of the ineffable wisdom of God residing in the Word,
and the <span id="fr_1752"></span>[1753](#fn_1752.md) Word Himself is all
things. Is not the beauty of the field in a manner with Him, inasmuch as
He is everywhere, and Himself hath said, “Heaven and earth I
fill”? <span id="fr_1753"></span>[1754](#fn_1753.md) What with Him is not,
of whom it is said, “If I shall have ascended into heaven, Thou art
there; and if I shall have descended into hell, Thou art present”? <span
id="fr_1754"></span>[1755](#fn_1754.md) With Him is the whole: but it is
not so with Him as that He doth suffer any contamination from those
things which He hath created, or any want of them. For with thee,
perchance, is a pillar near which thou art standing, and when thou art
weary, thou leanest against it. Thou needest that which is with thee,
God needeth not the field which is which Him. With Him is field, with
Him beauty of earth, with Him beauty of heaven, with Him all winged
creatures, because He is Himself everywhere. And wherefore are all
things near Him? Because even before that all things were, or were
created, to Him were known all things.

<span id="ii.L-p101"></span>19. Who can explain, who expound that which
is said to Him in another Psalm, “For my goods Thou needest not”? <span
id="fr_1755"></span>[1756](#fn_1755.md) He hath said that He needeth not
from us any necessary thing. “If I shall be hungry, I will not tell
thee” ([Psa. 50.12](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#012.md)<span
id="ii.L-p102.2"></span>). He that keepeth Israel shall neither hunger
nor thirst, nor be weary, nor fall asleep. <span
id="fr_1756"></span>[1757](#fn_1756.md) But, lo! according to thy carnality
I speak: because thou wilt suffer hunger when thou hast not eaten,
perhaps thou thinkest even God doth hunger that He may eat. Even though
He shall be hungry, He telleth not thee: all things are before Him,
whence He will He taketh what is needful for Him. These words are said
to convince little understanding; not that God hath declared His hunger.
Though for our sake this God of gods deigned even to hunger. He came to
hunger, and to fill; He came to thirst, and give drink; He came to be
clothed with mortality, and to clothe with immortality; He came poor, to
make rich. For He lost not His riches by taking to Him our poverty, for,
“In him are all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge hidden.” <span
id="fr_1757"></span>[1758](#fn_1757.md) “If I shall be hungry, I will not
tell thee. For Mine is the whole world, and the fulness thereof.” Do not
then labour to find what to give Me, without whom I have what I will.

<span id="ii.L-p105"></span>20. Why then dost still think of thy flocks?
“Shall I eat the flesh of bulls, or shall I drink the blood of
he-goats?” ([Psa. 50.13](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#013.md)<span
id="ii.L-p105.1"></span>). Ye have heard what of us He requireth not,
who willeth to enjoin us somewhat. If of such things ye were thinking,
now withdraw your thoughts from such things: think not to offer God any
such thing. If thou hast a fat bull, kill for the poor: let them eat the
flesh of bulls, though they shall not drink the blood of he-goats.
Which, when thou shalt have done, He will account it to thee, that hath
said, “If I shall be hungry, I will not tell thee:” and He shall say to
thee, “I was hungry, and thou gavest Me to eat.” “Shall I eat the flesh
of bulls, or shall I drink the blood of he-goats?” <span
id="fr_1758"></span>[1759](#fn_1758.md)

<span id="ii.L-p107"></span>21. Say then, Lord our God, what dost Thou
enjoin thy people, Thy Israel? “Immolate to God the sacrifice of praise”
([Psa. 50.14](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#014.md)<span
id="ii.L-p107.1"></span>). Let us also say to Him, “In me, O God, are
thy vows, which I will render of prose to Thee.” I had feared lest Thou
mightest enjoin something which would be out of my power, which I was
counting to be in my pen, and but now perchance it had been taken away
by a thief. What dost Thou enjoin me? “Immolate to God the sacrifice of
praise.” Let me revert to myself, wherein I may find what I may
immolate: let me revert to myself; in myself may I find immolation of
praise: be Thy altar my conscience. We are without anxiety, we go not
into Arabia in quest of frankincense: <span
id="fr_1759"></span>[1760](#fn_1759.md) not any bags of covetous dealer do
we sift: God requireth of us the sacrifice of praise. Zacchæus had the
sacrifice of praise in his patrimony; <span
id="fr_1760"></span>[1761](#fn_1760.md) the widow had it in her bag; <span
id="fr_1761"></span>[1762](#fn_1761.md) some poor host or other hath had it
in his jar: another neither in patrimony, nor in bag, nor in jar, hath
had anything, had it wholly in his heart: salvation was to the house of
Zacchæus; and more this poor widow cast in than those rich men: this
man, that doth offer a cup of cold water, shall not lose his
reward: <span id="fr_1762"></span>[1763](#fn_1762.md) but there is even
“peace on earth to men of good will.” <span
id="fr_1763"></span>[1764](#fn_1763.md) “Immolate to God the sacrifice of
praise.” O sacrifice gratuitous, by grace given! I have not indeed
bought this to offer, but Thou hast given: for not even this should I
have had. And this is the immolation of the sacrifice of praise, to
render thanks to Him from whom thou hast whatever of good thou hast, and
by whose mercy is forgiven thee whatsoever of evil of thine thou hast.
“Immolate to God the sacrifice of praise: and render to the Highest thy
prayers.” With this odour the Lord is well pleased. <span
id="fr_1764"></span>[1765](#fn_1764.md)

<span id="ii.L-p114"></span>22. “And call thou upon Me in the day of thy
tribulation: and I will draw thee forth, and thou shalt glorify Me”
([Psa. 50.15](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#015.md)<span
id="ii.L-p114.1"></span>). For thou <span id="page_186">p. 186</span>
<span id="ii.L-Page_186"></span>oughtest not to rely on thy powers, all
thy aids are deceitful. “Upon Me call thou in the day of tribulation: I
will draw thee forth, and thou shalt glorify Me.” For to this end I have
allowed the day of tribulation to come to thee: because perchance if
thou wast not troubled, thou wouldest not call on Me: but when thou art
troubled, thou callest on Me; when thou callest upon Me, I will draw
thee forth; when I shall draw thee forth, thou shalt glorify Me, that
thou mayest no more depart from Me. A certain man had grown dull and
cold in fervour of prayer, and said, “Tribulation and grief I found, and
on the Name of the Lord I called.” <span
id="fr_1765"></span>[1766](#fn_1765.md) He found tribulation as it were
some profitable thing; he had rotted in the slough of his sins; now he
had continued without feeling, he found tribulation to be a sort of
caustic and cutting. “I found,” he saith, “tribulation and grief, and on
the Name of the Lord I called.” And truly, brethren, tribulations are
known to all men. Behold those afflictions that abound in mankind; one
afflicted with loss bewaileth; another smitten with bereavement
mourneth; another exiled from country grieveth and desireth to return,
deeming sojourning intolerable; another’s vineyard is hailed upon, he
observeth his labours and all his toil spent in vain. When can a human
being not be made sad? An enemy he findeth in a friend. What greater
misery in mankind? These things all men do deplore and grieve at, and
these are tribulations: in all these they call upon the Lord, and they
do rightly. Let them call upon God, He is able either to teach how it
must be borne, or to heal it when borne. He knoweth how not to suffer us
to be tried above that we are able to bear. <span
id="fr_1766"></span>[1767](#fn_1766.md) Let us call upon God even in those
tribulations: but these tribulations do find us; as in another Psalm is
written, “Helper in tribulations which have found us too much:” <span
id="fr_1767"></span>[1768](#fn_1767.md) there is a certain tribulation
which we ought to find. Let such tribulations find us: there is a
certain tribulation which we ought to seek and to find. What is that?
The above-named felicity in this world, abundance of temporal things:
that is not indeed tribulation, these are the solaces of our
tribulation. Of what tribulation? Of our sojourning. For the very fact
that we are not yet with God, the very fact that we are living amid
trials and difficulties, that we cannot be without fear, is tribulation:
for there is not that peace which is promised us. He that shall not have
found this tribulation in his sojourning, doth not think of going home
to his father-land. This is tribulation, brethren. Surely now we do good
works, when we deal bread to the hungry, home to the stranger, and the
like: tribulation even this is. For we find pitiful objects upon whom we
show pity; and the pitiful case of pitiful objects maketh us
compassionate. How much better now would it be with thee in that place,
where thou findest no hungry man whom thou mayest feed, where thou
findest no stranger whom thou mayest take in, no naked man whom thou
mayest cover, no sick man whom thou mayest visit, no litigant whom thou
mayest set at one! For all things in that place are most high, are true,
are holy, are everlasting. Our bread in that place is righteousness, our
drink there is wisdom, our garment there is immortality, our house is
everlasting in the heavens, our stedfastness <span
id="fr_1768"></span>[1769](#fn_1768.md) is immortality: doth sickness come
over? Doth weariness weigh down to sleep? No death, no litigation: there
peace, quiet, joy, righteousness. No enemy hath entrance, no friend
falleth away. What is the quiet there? If we think and observe where we
are, and where He that cannot lie hath promised that we are to be, from
His very promise we find in what tribulation we are. This tribulation
none findeth, but he that shall have sought it. Thou art whole, see if
thou art miserable; for it is easy for him that is sick to find himself
miserable: when thou art whole, see if thou art miserable; that thou art
not yet with God. “Tribulation and grief I found, and on the Name of the
Lord I called.” <span id="fr_1769"></span>[1770](#fn_1769.md) “Immolate,”
therefore, “to God the sacrifice of praise.” Praise Him promising,
praise Him calling, praise Him exhorting, praise Him helping: and
understand in what tribulation thou art placed. Call upon (Him), thou
shalt be drawn forth, thou shalt glorify, shalt abide.

<span id="ii.L-p120"></span>23. But see what followeth, my brethren. For
now some one or other, because God had said to him, “Immolate to God the
sacrifice of praise,” and had enjoined in a manner this tribute, did
meditate to himself and said, I will rise daily, I will proceed to
Church, I will say one hymn at matins, another at vespers, a third or
fourth in my house, daily I do sacrifice the sacrifice of praise, and
immolate to my God. Well thou doest indeed, if thou doest this: but take
heed, lest now thou be careless, because now thou doest this: and
perchance thy tongue bless God, and thy life curse God. O my people,
saith to thee the God of gods, the Lord that spake, “calling the earth
from the rising of the sun unto the setting,” though yet thou art placed
amid the tares, <span id="fr_1770"></span>[1771](#fn_1770.md) “Immolate the
sacrifice of praise to thy God, and render to Him thy prayers:” but take
heed lest thou live ill, and chant well. Wherefore this? For, “Unto the
sinner, saith God, why dost thou tell out My judgments, and takest My
Covenant in thy mouth?” ([Psa.
50.16](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#016)<span id="ii.L-p121.2"></span>.md).
Ye see, brethren, with <span id="page_187">p. 187</span> <span
id="ii.L-Page_187"></span>what trembling we say these words. We take the
Covenant of God in our mouth, and we say these words. We take the
Covenant of God in our mouth, and we preach to you the instruction and
judgment of God. And what saith God to the sinner? “Why dost thou?” Doth
He then forbid preachers that be sinners? And where is that, “What they
say do, but what they do, do not”? <span
id="fr_1771"></span>[1772](#fn_1771.md) Where is that, “Whether in truth or
on occasion Christ be preached”? <span
id="fr_1772"></span>[1773](#fn_1772.md) But these words were said, lest
they should fear that hear, from whomsoever it be that they hear: not
that they should be without care that speak good words, and do evil
deeds. Now therefore, brethren, ye are without care: if ye hear good
words ye hear God, <span id="fr_1773"></span>[1774](#fn_1773.md) through
whomsoever it be that ye may hear. But God would not dismiss without
reproof them that speak: lest with their speaking alone, without care
for themselves they should slumber in evil life, and say to themselves,
“For God will not consign us to perdition, through whose mouth He has
willed that so many good words should be spoken to His people.” Nay, but
hear what thou speakest, whoever thou art that speakest: and thou that
writ be heard thyself, first hear thyself; and speak what a certain man
doth speak in another Psalm, <span id="fr_1774"></span>[1775](#fn_1774.md)
“I will hear what in me speaketh the Lord God, for He shall speak peace
to His people.” What am I then, that hear not what in me He speaketh,
and will that other hear what through me He speaketh? I will hear first,
will hear, and chiefly I will hear what speaketh in me the Lord God, for
He shall speak peace to His people. Let me hear, and “chasten my body,
and to servitude subject it, lest perchance to others preaching, myself
be found a cast-away.”  <span id="fr_1775"></span>[1776](#fn_1775.md) “Why
dost thou tell out my judgments?” Wherefore to thee what profiteth not
thee? He admonisheth him to hear: not to lay down preaching, but to take
up obedience. “But thou, why dost thou take My Covenant in they mouth?”

<span id="ii.L-p127"></span>24. “But thou hatest instruction” ([Psa.
50.17](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#017)<span id="ii.L-p127.1"></span>.md).
Thou hatest discipline. When I spare, thou singest and praisest: when I
chasten, thou murmurest: as though, when I spare, I am thy God: and,
when I chasten, I am not thy God. “I rebuke and chasten those whom I
love.” <span id="fr_1776"></span>[1777](#fn_1776.md) “But thou hatest
instruction: and hast thrown My sayings behind thee.” The words that are
said through thee, thou throwest behind thee. “And thou hast thrown My
sayings behind thee:” to a place where they may not be seen by thee, but
may load thee. “And thou hast thrown My sayings behind thee.”

<span id="ii.L-p129"></span>25. “If thou sawest a thief, thou didst
consent unto him, and with adulterers thou didst make thy portion”
([Psa. 50.18](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#018.md)<span
id="ii.L-p129.1"></span>). Lest perchance thou shouldest say, I have not
committed theft, I have not committed adultery. What if he pleased thee
that hath committed? Hast thou not with the very pleasing consented?
Hast thou not by approval made thy portion with him that hath committed?
For this is, brethren, to consent with a thief, and to make with an
adulterer thy portion: for even if thou committest not, and approvest
what is committed, thou art an accessory in the deed: for “the sinner is
praised in the longings of his soul, and he that doeth iniquity shall be
blessed.” <span id="fr_1777"></span>[1778](#fn_1777.md) Thou doest not evil
things, thou praisest evil-doers. For is this a small evil? “Thou didst
make thy portion with adulterers.”

<span id="ii.L-p131"></span>26. “Thy mouth hath abounded in malice, and
thy tongue hath embraced deceit” ([Psa.
50.19](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#019)<span id="ii.L-p131.1"></span>.md).
Of the malevolence and deceit, brethren, of certain men he speaketh, who
by adulation, though they know what they hear to be evil, yet lest they
offend those from whom they hear, not only by not reproving but by
holding their peace do consent. <span
id="fr_1778"></span>[1779](#fn_1778.md) Too little is it, that they do not
say, Thou hast done evil: but they even say, Thou hast done even well:
and they know it to be evil: but their mouth aboundeth in malice, and
their tongue embraceth deceit. Deceit is a sort of guile in words, of
uttering one thing, thinking another. He saith not, thy tongue hath
committed deceit or perpetrated deceit, but in order to point out to
thee a kind of pleasure taken in the very evil doing, He hath said,
“Hath embraced.” It is too little that thou doest it, thou art delighted
too; thou praisest openly, thou laughest to thyself. Thou dost push to
destruction a man heedlessly putting forth his faults, and knowing not
whether they be faults: thou that knowest it to be a fault, sayest not,
“Whither art thou rushing?” If thou wert to see him heedlessly walk in
the dark, where thou knewest a well to be, and wert to hold thy peace,
of what sort wouldest thou be? wouldest thou not be set down for an
enemy of his life?  <span id="fr_1779"></span>[1780](#fn_1779.md) And yet
if he were to fall into a well, not in soul <span
id="fr_1780"></span>[1781](#fn_1780.md) but in body he would die. He doth
fall headlong into his vices, he doth expose before thee his evil
doings: thou knowest them to be evil, and praisest and laughest to
thyself. Oh that at length he were to be turned to God at whom thou
laughest, and whom thou wouldest not reprove, and that he were to say,
“Let them be confounded that say to me, Well, well.” <span
id="fr_1781"></span>[1782](#fn_1781.md)

<span id="ii.L-p136"></span>27. “Sitting against thy brother thou didst
detract” ([Psa. 50.20](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#020.md)<span
id="ii.L-p136.1"></span>). And this “sitting” doth belong to that
whereof he hath spoken above in, <span id="page_188">p. 188</span> <span
id="ii.L-Page_188"></span>“hath embraced.” For he that doeth anything
while standing or passing along, doth it not with pleasure: but if he
for this purpose sitteth, how much leisure doth he seek out to do it!
That very evil detraction thou wast making with diligence, thou wast
making sitting; thou wouldest thereon be wholly engaged; thou wast
embracing thy evil, thou wast kissing thy craftiness. “And against thy
mother’s son thou didst lay a stumbling-block.” Who is “mother’s son”?
Is it not brother? He would repeat then the same that he had said above,
“thy brother.” Hath he intimated that any distinction must be perceived
by us? Evidently, brethren, I think a distinction must be made. Brother
against brother doth detract, for example’s sake, as though for instance
one strong, and now a doctor and scholar of some weight, doth detract
from his brother, one perchance that is teaching well and walking well:
but another is weak, against him he layeth a stumbling-block by
detracting from the former. For when the good are detracted from by
those that seem to be of some weight and to be learned, the weak fall
upon the stumbling-block, who as yet know not how to judge. Therefore
this weak one is called “mother’s son,” not yet father’s, still needing
milk, and hanging on the breast. He is borne as yet in the bosom of his
mother the Church, he is not strong enough to draw near to the solid
food of his Father’s table, but from the mother’s breast he draweth
sustenance, unskilled in judging, inasmuch as yet he is animal and
carnal. “For the spiritual man judgeth all things,” <span
id="fr_1782"></span>[1783](#fn_1782.md) but “the animal man perceiveth not
those things which are of the Spirit of God; for they are foolishness to
him.” <span id="fr_1783"></span>[1784](#fn_1783.md) To such men saith the
Apostle, “I could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto
carnal, as to babes in Christ I gave you milk to drink, not meat; for ye
were not able, but not even now are ye able.” <span
id="fr_1784"></span>[1785](#fn_1784.md) A mother I have been to you: as is
said in another place, “I became a babe among you, even as a nurse
cherishing her own children.” <span id="fr_1785"></span>[1786](#fn_1785.md)
Not a nurse nursing children of others, but a nurse cherishing her own
children. For there are mothers who when they have borne give to nurses:
they that have borne cherish not their children, because they have given
them to be nursed; <span id="fr_1786"></span>[1787](#fn_1786.md) but those
that cherish, cherish not their own, but those of others: but he himself
had borne, he was himself cherishing, to no nurse did commit what he had
borne; for he had said, “Of whom I travail again until Christ be formed
in you.” <span id="fr_1787"></span>[1788](#fn_1787.md) He did cherish them,
and gave milk. But there were some as it were learned and spiritual men
who detracted from Paul. “His letters indeed, say they, are weighty and
powerful; but the presence of his body weak, and speech
contemptible:” <span id="fr_1788"></span>[1789](#fn_1788.md) he saith
himself in his Epistle, that certain his detractors had said these
words. They were sitting, and were detracting against their brother, and
against that their mother’s son, to be fed with milk, they were laying a
stumbling-block. “And against thy mother’s son thou didst lay a
stumbling-block.”

<span id="ii.L-p144"></span>28. “These things hast thou done, and I held
my tongue” ([Psa. 50.21](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#021.md)<span
id="ii.L-p144.1"></span>). Therefore the Lord our God shall come, and
shall not keep silence. Now, “These things hast thou done, and I held my
tongue.” What is, “I held my tongue”? From vengeance I have desisted, my
severity I have deferred, patience to thee I have prolonged, thy
repentance I have long looked for…“Thou hast imagined iniquity, that I
shall be like unto thee;” Thou hast <span
id="fr_1789"></span>[1790](#fn_1789.md) imagined that I shall be like unto
thee, while thou wilt not be like unto Me. For, “Be ye,” he saith,
“perfect, even as your Father, which is in the heavens, who maketh His
sun to rise on the good and evil.” <span
id="fr_1790"></span>[1791](#fn_1790.md) Him thou wouldest not copy, who
giveth good things even to evil men, insomuch that sitting thou dost
detract even from good men. “I will reprove thee,” when “God manifest
shall come, our God, and shall not keep silence,” “I will reprove thee.”
And what to thee shall I do in reproving thee? what to thee shall I do?
Now thyself thou seest not, I will make thee see thyself. Because if
thou shouldest see thyself, and shouldest displease thyself, thou
wouldest please Me: but because not seeing thyself thou hast pleased
thyself, thou wilt displease both Me and thyself; Me when thou shalt be
judged; thyself when thou shalt burn. But what to thee shall I do? He
saith. “I will set thee before thy face.” For why wouldest thou escape
thyself? At thy back thou art to thyself, thou seest not thyself: I make
thee see thyself: what behind thy back thou hast put, before thy face
will I put; thou shalt see thy uncleanness, not that thou mayest amend,
but that thou mayest blush.…

<span id="ii.L-p147"></span>29. But, “understand these things, ye that
forget God” ([Psa. 50.22](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#022.md)<span
id="ii.L-p147.1"></span>). See how He crieth, and keepeth not silence,
spareth <span id="fr_1791"></span>[1792](#fn_1791.md) not. Thou hadst
forgotten the Lord, <span id="fr_1792"></span>[1793](#fn_1792.md) didst not
think of thy evil life. Perceive how thou hast forgotten the Lord. “Lest
at length He seize like a lion, and there be none to deliver.” What is
“like a lion”? Like a brave one, like a mighty one, like him whom none
can withstand. To this he made reference when he said, “Lion.” For it is
used <span id="page_189">p. 189</span> <span
id="ii.L-Page_189"></span>for praise, it is used also for showing evil.
The devil hath been called lion: “Your adversary,” He saith, “like a
roaring lion, goeth about seeking whom He may devour.” <span
id="fr_1793"></span>[1794](#fn_1793.md) May it not be that whereas he hath
been called lion because of savage fierceness, Christ hath been called
Lion for wondrous mightiness? And where is that, “The Lion hath
prevailed of the tribe of Judah?” <span
id="fr_1794"></span>[1795](#fn_1794.md) …

<span id="ii.L-p152"></span>30. “Sacrifice of praise shall glorify Me”
([Psa. 50.23](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#023.md)<span
id="ii.L-p152.1"></span>). How shall “sacrifice of praise glorify Me”?
Assuredly sacrifice of praise doth no wise profit evil men, because they
take Thy Covenant in their mouth, and do damnable things that displease
Thine eyes. Straightway, he saith, even to them this I say, “Sacrifice
of praise shall glorify Me.” For if thou livest ill and speakest good
words, not yet dost thou praise: but again, if, when thou beginnest to
live well, to thy merits thou dost ascribe thy living well, not yet dost
thou praise.…Therefore the Publican went down justified, rather than
that Pharisee. Therefore hear ye that live well, hear ye that live ill:
“Sacrifice of praise shall glorify Me.” No one offereth Me this
sacrifice, and is evil. I say not, Let there not offer Me this any one
that is evil; but no one doth offer Me this, that is evil. For he that
praiseth, is good: because if he praiseth, he doth also live well,
because if he praiseth, not only with tongue he praiseth, but life also
with tongue doth agree.

<span id="ii.L-p153"></span>31. “And there is the way whereby I will
show him the salvation of God.” In sacrifice of praise “is the way.”
What is “the salvation of God”? Christ Jesus. And how in sacrifice of
praise to us is shown Christ? Because Christ with grace came to us.
These words saith the Apostle: “But I live, now not I, but Christ liveth
in me: but that in flesh I live, in faith I live of the Son of God, who
loved me, and gave Himself for me.”  <span
id="fr_1795"></span>[1796](#fn_1795.md) Acknowledge then sinners, that
there would not need physician, if they were whole. <span
id="fr_1796"></span>[1797](#fn_1796.md) For Christ died for the
ungodly. <span id="fr_1797"></span>[1798](#fn_1797.md) When then they
acknowledge their ungodlinesses, and first copy that Publican, saying,
“Lord, be merciful to me a sinner:” <span
id="fr_1798"></span>[1799](#fn_1798.md) show wounds, beseech Physician: and
because they praise not themselves, but blame themselves,—“So that he
that glorieth, not in himself but in the Lord may glory,” <span
id="fr_1799"></span>[1800](#fn_1799.md) —they acknowledge the cause of the
coming of Christ, because for this end He came, that He might save
sinners: for “Jesus Christ came,” he saith, “into this world to save
sinners; of whom I am chief.” <span id="fr_1800"></span>[1801](#fn_1800.md)
Further, those Jews, boasting of their work, thus the same Apostle doth
rebuke, in saying, that they to grace belonged not, who to their merits
and their works thought that reward was owing. <span
id="fr_1801"></span>[1802](#fn_1801.md) He therefore that knoweth himself
to belong to grace, doth know what is Christ and what is Christ’s
because he needeth grace. If grace it is called, *gratis* it is given;
if *gratis* it is given, not any merits of time have preceded that it
should be given.…
