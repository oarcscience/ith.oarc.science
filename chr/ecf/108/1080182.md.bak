<span id="ii.CXLIX-p1"></span> <span id="ii.CXLIX-p1.1"></span><span
class="c20"><span id="ii.CXLIX-p1.2"></span>Psalm CXLIX. <span
id="fr_5974"></span>[5975](#fn_5974.md) </span>

<span id="ii.CXLIX-p3"></span>1. Let us praise the Lord both in voice,
and in understanding, and in good works; and, as this Psalm exhorteth,
let us sing unto Him a new song. It beginneth: “Sing ye to the Lord a
new song. His praise is in the Church of the Saints” ([Psa.
149.1](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#001.md)<span
id="ii.CXLIX-p3.1"></span>). The old man hath an old song, the new man a
new song. The Old Testament is an old song, the New Testament a new
song. In the Old Testament are temporal and earthly promises. Whoso
loveth earthly things singeth an old song: let him that desireth to sing
a new song, love the things of eternity. Love itself is new and eternal;
therefore is it ever new, because it never groweth old.…And this song is
of peace, this song is of charity. Whoso severeth himself from the union
of the saints, singeth not a new song; for he hath followed old strife,
not new charity. In new charity what is there? Peace, the bond of an
holy society, a spiritual union, a building of living stones. Where is
this? Not in one place, but throughout the whole world. This is said in
another Psalm, “Sing unto the Lord, all the earth.” <span
id="fr_5975"></span>[5976](#fn_5975.md) From this is understood, that he
who singeth not with the whole earth, singeth an old song, whatever
words proceed out of his mouth.…We have already said, brethren, that all
the earth singeth a new song. He who singeth not with the whole earth a
new song, let him sing what he will, let his tongue sound forth
Halleluia, let him utter it all day and all night, my ears are not so
much bent to hear the voice of the singer, but I seek the deeds of the
doer. For I ask, and say, “What is it that thou singest?” He answereth,
“Halleluia.” What is “Halleluia”? “Praise ye the Lord.” Come, let us
praise the Lord together. If thou praisest the Lord, and I praise the
Lord, why are we at variance? Charity praiseth the Lord, discord
blasphemeth the Lord.”…

<span id="ii.CXLIX-p5"></span>2. The field of the Lord is the world, not
Africa. It is not with the Lord’s field, as it is without these fields
of ours, where Getulia bears sixty or an hundred fold, Numidia only ten
fold: everywhere fruit is borne to Him, both an hundred fold, and sixty
fold, and thirty fold: only do thou choose what thou wilt be, if thou
thinkest to belong to the Lord’s Cross. “The Church” then “of the
saints” is the Catholic Church. The Church of the saints is not the
Church of heretics. The Church of the saints is that which God first
prefigured before it was seen, and then set forth that it might be seen.
The Church of the saints was heretofore in writings, now it is in
nations: the Church of the saints was heretofore only read of, now it is
both read of and seen. When it was only read of, it was believed; now it
is seen, and is spoken against. His praise is in the “children of the
kingdom,” that is, “the Church of the saints.”

<span id="ii.CXLIX-p6"></span>3. “Let Israel rejoice in Him who made
Him” ([Psa. 149.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#002.md)<span
id="ii.CXLIX-p6.1"></span>). What is, “Israel”? “Seeing God.” He who
seeth God, rejoiceth in Him by whom he was made. What is it then,
brethren? we have said that we belong to the Church of the saints: do we
already see God? and how are we Israel, if we see not? There is one
<span id="page_678">p. 678</span> <span
id="ii.CXLIX-Page_678"></span>kind of sight belonging to this present
time; there will be another belonging to the time hereafter: the sight
which now is, is by faith; the sight which is to be will be in reality.
If we believe, we see; if we love, we see: see what? God. Ask John: “God
is love;” <span id="fr_5976"></span>[5977](#fn_5976.md) let us bless His
holy Name, and rejoice in God by rejoicing in love. Whoso hath love, why
send we him afar to see God? Let him regard his own conscience, and
there he seeth God.…“And let the sons of Sion exult in their King.” The
sons of the Church are Israel. For Sion indeed was one city, which fell:
amid its ruins certain saints dwelt after the flesh: but the true Sion,
the true Jerusalem (for Sion and Jerusalem are one), is “eternal in the
heavens,”  <span id="fr_5977"></span>[5978](#fn_5977.md) and is “our
mother.” <span id="fr_5978"></span>[5979](#fn_5978.md) She it is that hath
given us birth, she is the Church of the saints, she hath nourished us,
she, who is in part a pilgrim, in part abiding in the heavens. In the
part which abideth in heaven is the bliss of angels, in the part which
wandereth in this world is the hope of the righteous. Of the former is
said, “Glory to God in the highest;” of the latter, “and on earth peace
to men of good will.” <span id="fr_5979"></span>[5980](#fn_5979.md) Let
those then who, being in this life, groan, and long for their country,
run by love, not by bodily feet; let them seek not ships but wings, let
them lay hold on the two wings of love. What are the two wings of love?
The love of God, and of our neighbour. For now we are pilgrims, we sigh,
we groan. There has come to us a letter from our country: we read it to
you. “And the sons of Sion shall exult in their King.” The Son of God,
who made us, was made one of us: and He rules us as our King, because He
is our Creator, who made us. But He by whom we were made is the same as
He by whom we are ruled, and we are Christians because He is Christ. He
is called Christ from Chrism, that is, Anointing.…Give to the Priest
somewhat to offer. What could man find which he could give as a clean
victim? What victim? what clean thing can a sinner offer? O unrighteous,
O sinful man, whatever thou offerest is unclean, and somewhat that is
clean must be offered for thee.…Let then the Priest that is clean offer
Himself, and cleanse thee. This is what Christ did. He found in man
nothing clean for Him to offer for man: He offered Himself as a clean
Victim. Happy Victim, true Victim, spotless Offering. He offered not
then what we gave Him; yea rather, He offered what He took of us, and
offered it clean. For of us He took flesh, and this He offered. But
where took He it? In the womb of the Virgin Mary, that He might offer it
clean for us unclean. He is our King, He is our Priest, in Him let us
rejoice.

<span id="ii.CXLIX-p11"></span>4. “Let them praise His Name in chorus”
([Psa. 149.3](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#003.md)<span
id="ii.CXLIX-p11.1"></span>). What meaneth “chorus”? Many know what a
“chorus” is: nay, as we are speaking in a town, almost all know. A
“chorus” is the union of singers. If we sing “in chorus,” let us sing in
concord. If any one’s voice is out of harmony in a chorus of singers, it
offendeth the ear, and throweth the chorus into confusion. If the voice
of one echoing discordantly troubleth the harmony of them who sing, how
doth the discord of heresy throw into confusion the harmony of them who
praise. The whole world is now the chorus of Christ. The chorus of
Christ soundeth harmoniously from east to west. <span
id="fr_5980"></span>[5981](#fn_5980.md) “Let them sing a psalm unto Him
with timbrel and psaltery.” Wherefore taketh he to him the “timbrel and
psaltery”? That not the voice alone may praise, but the works too. When
timbrel and psaltery are taken, the hands harmonize with the voice. So
too do thou, whensoever thou singest “Halleluia,” deal forth thy bread
to the hungry, clothe the naked, take in the stranger: then doth not
only thy voice sound, but thy hand soundeth in harmony with it, for thy
deeds agree with thy words. Thou hast taken to thee an instrument, and
thy fingers agree with thy tongue. Nor must we keep back the mystical
meaning of the “timbrel and psaltery.” On the timbrel leather is
stretched, on the psaltery gut is stretched; on either instrument the
flesh is crucified. How well did he “sing a psalm on timbrel and
psaltery,” who said, “the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the
world”? <span id="fr_5981"></span>[5982](#fn_5981.md) This psaltery or
timbrel He wishes thee to take up, who loveth a new song, who teacheth
thee, saying to thee, “Whosoever willeth to be My disciple, let him deny
himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.” <span
id="fr_5982"></span>[5983](#fn_5982.md) Let him not set down his psaltery,
let him not set down his timbrel, let him stretch himself out on the
wood, and be dried from the lust of the flesh. The more the strings are
stretched, the more sharply do they sound. The Apostle Paul then, in
order that his psaltery might sound sharply, what said he? “Stretching
forth unto those things which are before,” etc. <span
id="fr_5983"></span>[5984](#fn_5983.md) He stretched himself: Christ
touched him; and the sweetness of truth sounded.

<span id="ii.CXLIX-p16"></span>5. “For the Lord hath dealt kindly among
His people” ([Psa. 149.4](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#004.md)<span
id="ii.CXLIX-p16.1"></span>). What dealing so kindly, as to die for the
ungodly? What dealing so kindly, as with righteous Blood to blot out the
handwriting against the sinner? What dealing so kindly, as to say, “I
regard not what ye were, be ye now what ye were not”? He dealeth kindly
in converting him that was turned away, in aiding <span id="page_679">p.
679</span> <span id="ii.CXLIX-Page_679"></span>him that is fighting, in
crowning the conqueror. “And the meek He shall lift up in salvation.”
For the proud too are lifted up, but not in salvation: the meek are
lifted in salvation, the proud in death: that is, the proud lift up
themselves, and God humbleth them: the meek humble themselves, and God
lifteth them up.

<span id="ii.CXLIX-p17"></span>6. “The saints shall exult in glory”
([Psa. 149.5](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#005.md)<span
id="ii.CXLIX-p17.1"></span>). I would say somewhat important about the
glory of the saints. For there is no one who loveth not glory. But the
glory of fools, popular glory as it is called, hath snares to deceive,
so that a man, influenced by the praises of vain men, shall be willing
to live in such fashion as to be spoken of by men, whosoever they be, in
whatsoever way. Hence it is that men, rendered mad, and puffed up with
pride, empty within, without swollen, are willing ever to ruin their
fortunes by bestowing them on stage-players, actors, men who fight with
wild beasts, charioteers. What sums they give, what sums they spend!
They lavish the powers not only of their patrimony, but of their minds
too. They scorn the poor, because the people shouteth not that the poor
should be given to, but the people do shout that the fighter with wild
beasts be given to. When then no shout is raised to them, they refuse to
spend; when madmen shout to them, they are mad too: nay, all are mad,
both performer, and spectator, and the giver. This mad glory is blamed
by the Lord, is offensive in the eyes of the Almighty.…Thou choosest to
clothe the fighter with wild beasts, who may be beaten, and make thee
blush: Christ is never conquered; He hath conquered the devil, He hath
conquered for thee, and to thee, and in thee; such a conqueror as this
thou choosest not to clothe. Wherefore? Because there is less shouting,
less madness about it. They then who delight in such glory, have an
empty conscience. Just as they drain their chests, to send garments as
presents, so do they empty their conscience, so as to have nothing
precious therein.

<span id="ii.CXLIX-p18"></span>7. But the saints who “exult in glory,”
no need is there for us to say how they exult: just hear the verse of
the Psalm which followeth: “The saints shall exult in glory, they shall
rejoice in their beds:” not in theatres, or amphitheatres, or circuses,
or follies, or market places, but “in their chambers.” What is, “in
their chambers”? In their hearts. <span
id="fr_5984"></span>[5985](#fn_5984.md) Hear the Apostle Paul exulting in
his closet: “For this is our glory, the testimony of our
conscience.” <span id="fr_5985"></span>[5986](#fn_5985.md) On the other
hand, there is reason to fear lest any be pleasing to himself, and so
seem to be proud, and boast of his conscience. For every one ought to
exult with fear, for that wherein he exulteth is God’s gift, not his own
desert. For there be many that please themselves, and think themselves
righteous; and there is another passage which goeth against them, which
saith, “Who shall boast that he hath a clean heart, and that he is pure
from sin?”  <span id="fr_5986"></span>[5987](#fn_5986.md) There is then, so
to speak, a limit to glorying in our conscience, namely, to know that
thy faith is sincere, thy hope sure, thy love without dissimulation.
“The exultations of God are in their mouths” ([Psa.
149.6](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#006.md)<span
id="ii.CXLIX-p21.2"></span>). In such wise shall they “rejoice in their
closets,” as not to attribute to themselves that they are good, but
praise Him from whom they have what they are, by whom they are called to
attain to what they are not, and from whom they hope for perfection, to
whom they give thanks, because He hath begun.

<span id="ii.CXLIX-p22"></span>8. “And swords <span
id="fr_5987"></span>[5988](#fn_5987.md) sharpened on both sides in their
hands.” This sort of weapon contains a great mystical meaning, in that
it is sharp on both sides. By “swords sharpened on both sides,” we
understand the Word of the Lord: <span
id="fr_5988"></span>[5989](#fn_5988.md) it is one sword, but therefore are
they called many, because there are many mouths and many tongues of the
saints. How is it two edged? It speaks of things temporal, it speaks
also of things eternal. In both cases it proveth what it saith, and him
whom it strikes, it severeth from the world. Is not this the sword
whereof the Lord said, “I am not come to send peace upon earth, but a
sword”? <span id="fr_5989"></span>[5990](#fn_5989.md) Observe how He came
to divide, how He came to sever. He divideth the saints, He divideth the
ungodly, He severeth from thee that which hindereth thee. The son
willeth to serve God, the father willeth not: the sword cometh, the Word
of God cometh, and severeth the son from the father.…Wherefore then is
it in their hands, not in their tongues? “And swords,” it saith,
“sharpened on both sides in their hands.” By “in their hands,” he
meaneth in power. They received then the word of God in power, to speak
where they would, to whom they would, neither to fear power, nor to
despise poverty. For they had in their hands a sword; where they would
they brandished it, handled it, smote with it: and all this was in the
power of the preachers. For if the Word be not in their hands, why is it
written, “The Word of the Lord was put in the hand of the Prophet
Haggai”? <span id="fr_5990"></span>[5991](#fn_5990.md) Surely, brethren,
God set not His Word in His fingers. What is meant by, “was put in his
hand”? It was put into his power to preach the Word of the <span
id="page_680">p. 680</span> <span id="ii.CXLIX-Page_680"></span>Lord.
Lastly, we can understand these “hands” in another way also. For they
who spake had the word of God in their tongues, they who wrote, in their
hands.

<span id="ii.CXLIX-p27"></span>9. Now, brethren, ye see the saints
armed: observe the slaughter, observe their glorious battles. For if
there be a commander, there must be soldiers; if soldiers, an enemy; if
a warfare, a victory. What have these done who had in their hands swords
sharpened on both sides? “To do vengeance on the nations.” See whether
vengeance have not been done on the nations. Daily is it done: we do it
ourselves by speaking. Observe how the nations of Babylon are slain. She
is repaid twofold: for so is it written of her, “repay her double for
what she hath done.” <span id="fr_5991"></span>[5992](#fn_5991.md) How is
she repaid double? The saints wage war, they draw their “swords twice
sharpened;” thence come defeats, slaughters, severances: how is she
repaid double? When she had power to persecute the Christians, she slew
the flesh indeed, but she crushed not God: now she is repaid double, for
the Pagans are extinguished and the idols are broken.…And lest thou
shouldest think that men are really smitten with the sword, blood really
shed, wounds made in the flesh, he goeth on and explaineth, “upbraidings
among the peoples.” What is “upbraidings”? Reproof. Let the “sword twice
sharpened” go forth from you, delay not. Say to thy friend, if yet thou
hast one <span id="fr_5992"></span>[5993](#fn_5992.md) left to whom to say
it, “What kind of man art thou, who hast abandoned Him by whom thou wast
made, and worshippest what He made? Better is the Workman, than that
which He worketh.” When he beginneth to blush, when he beginneth to feel
compunction, thou hast made a wound with thy sword, it hath reached the
heart, he is about to die, that he may live.

<span id="ii.CXLIX-p30"></span>10. “That they may bind their kings in
fetters, and their nobles in bonds of iron” ([Psa.
149.8](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#008.md)<span
id="ii.CXLIX-p30.1"></span>). “To execute upon them the judgment
written” ([Psa. 149.9](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#009.md)<span
id="ii.CXLIX-p30.2"></span>). The kings of the Gentiles are to be bound
in fetters, “and their nobles in fetters,” and that “of iron.”…For these
verses which we are beginning to explain are obscure. For for this
purpose God willed to set down some of His verses obscurely, not that
anything new should be dug out of them, but that what was already well
known, might be made new by being obscurely set forth. We know that
kings have been made Christians; we know that the nobles of the Gentiles
have been made Christians. They are being made so at this day; they have
been, they shall be; the “swords twice sharpened” are not idle in the
hands of the saints. How then do we understand their being bound in
fetters and chains of iron? Ye know, beloved and learned brethren
(learned I call you, for ye have been nourished in the Church, and are
accustomed to hear God’s Word read), <span
id="fr_5993"></span>[5994](#fn_5993.md) that “God hath chosen the weak
things of the world to confound the strong, and the foolish things of
the world hath God chosen to confound the wise, and things which are
not, just as things which are, that the things which are may be brought
to nought.” <span id="fr_5994"></span>[5995](#fn_5994.md) …It is said by
the Lord, “If thou wilt be perfect, go sell all that thou hast, and give
to the poor, and come, follow Me, and thou shalt have treasure in
heaven.” <span id="fr_5995"></span>[5996](#fn_5995.md) Many of the nobles
did this, but they ceased to be nobles of the Gentiles, they chose
rather to be poor in this world, noble in Christ. But many retain their
former nobility, retain their royal powers, and yet are Christians.
These are, as it were, “in fetters and in bonds of iron.” How so? they
received fetters, to keep them from going to things unlawful, the
“fetters of wisdom,” <span id="fr_5996"></span>[5997](#fn_5996.md) the
fetters of the Word of God. Wherefore then are they bonds of iron and
not bonds of gold? They are iron so long as they fear: let them love,
and they shall be golden. Observe, beloved, what I say. Ye have heard
just now the Apostle John, “There is no fear in love, but perfect love
casteth out fear, because fear hath torment.” <span
id="fr_5997"></span>[5998](#fn_5997.md) This is the bond of iron. And yet
unless a man begin through fear to worship God, he will not attain to
love. “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.” <span
id="fr_5998"></span>[5999](#fn_5998.md) The beginning then is bonds of
iron, the end a collar of gold. For it is said of wisdom, “a collar of
gold around thy neck.” <span id="fr_5999"></span>[6000](#fn_5999.md) …There
cometh to us a man powerful in this world, his wife offendeth him, and
perhaps he hath desired another man’s wife who is more beautiful, or
another woman who is richer, he wisheth to put away the one he hath, yet
he doeth it not. He heareth the words of the servant of God, he heareth
the Prophet, he heareth the Apostle, and he doeth it not; he is told by
one in whose hands is a “sword twice sharpened,” “Thou shalt not do it:
it is not lawful for thee: God alloweth thee not to put away thy wife,
“save for the cause of fornication.” <span
id="fr_6000"></span>[6001](#fn_6000.md) He heareth this, he feareth, and
doeth it not.…Listen, young men; the bonds are of iron, seek not to set
your feet within them; if ye do, ye shall be bound more tightly with
fetters. Such fetters the hands of the Bishop make strong for you. Do
not men who are thus fettered fly to the Church, and are here loosed?
Men do fly hither, desiring to be rid of their wives: here they are more
tightly bound: no man looseth these fetters. “What God joined together,
let not man put asunder.” <span id="fr_6001"></span>[6002](#fn_6001.md) But
these bonds are <span id="page_681">p. 681</span> <span
id="ii.CXLIX-Page_681"></span>hard. Who but knows it? This hardness the
Apostles grieved at, and said, “If this be the case with a wife, it is
not good to marry.” <span id="fr_6002"></span>[6003](#fn_6002.md) If the
bonds be of iron, it is not good to set our feet within them. And the
Lord said, “All men cannot receive this saying, but let him that can
receive it, receive it.” <span id="fr_6003"></span>[6004](#fn_6003.md) “Art
thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be freed,” for thou art bound with
bonds of iron. “Art thou free from a wife, seek not a wife;” bind not
thyself with bonds of iron.

<span id="ii.CXLIX-p42"></span>11. “To do in them the judgment that is
written.” This is the judgment which the saints do throughout all
nations. Wherefore “written”? Because these things were before written,
and now are fulfilled. Behold now they are being done: erst they were
read, and were not done. And he hath concluded thus, “this glory have
all His saints.” Throughout the whole world, throughout entire nations,
this the saints do, thus are they glorified, thus do they “exalt God
with their mouths,” thus do they “rejoice in their beds,” thus do they
“exult in their glory,” thus are they “lifted up in salvation,” thus do
they “sing a new song,” thus in heart and voice and life they say
Halleluia. Amen.
