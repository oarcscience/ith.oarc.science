<span id="ii.LXXXVII-p1"></span> <span id="ii.LXXXVII-p1.1"></span><span
class="c20"><span id="ii.LXXXVII-p1.2"></span>Psalm LXXXVII. <span
id="fr_4028"></span>[4029](#fn_4028.md) </span>

<span id="ii.LXXXVII-p3"></span>1. The Psalm which has just been sung is
short, if we look to the number of its words, but of deep interest in
its thoughts. <span id="fr_4029"></span>[4030](#fn_4029.md) …The subject of
song and praise in that Psalm is a city, whose citizens are we, as far
as we are Christians: whence we are absent, as long as we are mortal:
whither we are tending: through whose approaches, undiscoverable among
the brakes and thorns that entangle them, the Sovereign of the city made
Himself a path <span id="fr_4030"></span>[4031](#fn_4030.md) for us to
reach it. Walking thus in Christ, and pilgrims till we arrive, and
sighing as we long for a certain ineffable repose that dwells within
that city, a repose of which it is promised, that “the eye of man hath
never seen” such, “nor ear heard, nor hath it entered into his heart to
conceive;” let us chant the song of a longing heart: for he who truly
longs, thus sings within his soul, though his tongue be silent: he who
does not, however he may resound in human ears, is voiceless to God. See
what ardent lovers of that city were they by whom these words were
composed, by whom they have been handed down to us; with how deep a
feeling were they sung by those! A feeling that the love of that city
created in them: that love the Spirit of God inspired; “the love <span
id="page_420">p. 420</span> <span id="ii.LXXXVII-Page_420"></span>of
God,” he saith, “shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, which is
given unto us.” Fervent with this Spirit then, let us listen to what is
said of that city.

<span id="ii.LXXXVII-p6"></span>2. “Her foundations are upon the holy
hills” ([Psa. 87.1](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#001.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXVII-p6.1"></span>). The Psalm had as yet said nothing of the
city: it begins thus, and says, “Her foundations are upon the holy
hills.” Whose? There can be no doubt that foundations, especially among
the hills, belong to some city. Thus filled with the Holy Spirit, and
with many thoughts of love and longing for that city, as if after long
internal meditation, that citizen bursts out, “Her foundations are upon
the holy hills;” as if he had already said something concerning it. And
how could he have said nothing on a subject, respecting which in his
heart he had never been silent? For how could “her foundations” have
been written, of which nothing had been said before? But, as I said,
after long and silent travailing in contemplation of that city in his
mind, crying to God, he bursts out into the ears of men thus: “Her
foundations are upon the holy hills.” And, supposing persons who heard
to enquire of what city he spoke he adds, “the Lord loveth the gates of
Sion.” Behold, then, a city whose foundations are upon the holy hills, a
city called Sion, whose gates the Lord loveth, as he adds, “above all
the dwellings of Jacob.” But what doth this mean, “her foundations on
the holy hills”? What are the holy hills upon which this city is built?
Another citizen tells us this more explicitly, the Apostle Paul: of this
was the Prophet a citizen, of this the Apostle citizen: and they spoke
to exhort the other citizens. But how are these, I mean the Prophets and
Apostles, citizens? Perhaps in this sense; that they are themselves the
hills, upon which are the foundations of this city, whose gates the Lord
loveth. Let then another citizen state this clearly, that I may not seem
to guess. Speaking to the Gentiles, and telling them how they were
returning, and being, as it were, framed together into the holy
structure, “built,” he says, “upon the foundations of the Apostles and
Prophets:” and because neither the Apostles nor Prophets, upon whom the
foundations of that city rest, could stand by their own power, he adds,
“Jesus Christ Himself being the head comer stone.” <span
id="fr_4031"></span>[4032](#fn_4031.md) That the Gentiles, therefore, might
not think they had no relation to Sion: for Sion was a certain city of
this world, which bore a typical resemblance as a shadow to that Sion of
which he presently speaketh, that Heavenly Jerusalem, of which the
Apostle saith, “which is the mother of us all;” <span
id="fr_4032"></span>[4033](#fn_4032.md) they might not be said to bear no
relation to Sion, on the ground that they did not belong to the Jewish
people, he addresses them thus: “Now therefore ye are no more strangers
and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints, and of the
household of God, and are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and
Prophets.” <span id="fr_4033"></span>[4034](#fn_4033.md) Thou seest the
structure of so great a city: yet whereon does all that edifice repose,
where does it rest, that it may never fall? “Jesus Christ Himself,” he
saith, “being the head corner stone.”

<span id="ii.LXXXVII-p10"></span>3. …But that ye may know that Christ is
at once the earliest and the highest foundation, the Apostle saith,
“Other foundation can no man lay than is laid, which is Christ
Jesus.” <span id="fr_4034"></span>[4035](#fn_4034.md) How, then, are the
Prophets and Apostles foundations, and yet Christ so, than whom nothing
can be higher? How, think you, save that as He is openly styled, Saint
of saints, so figuratively Foundation of foundations? Thus if thou art
thinking of mysteries, Christ is the Saint of saints: if of a subject
flock, the Shepherd of shepherds: if of a structure, the Pillar of
pillars. In material edifices, the same stone cannot be above and below:
if at the bottom, it cannot be at the top: and *vice versa:* for almost
all bodies are liable to limitations in space: nor can they be
everywhere or for ever; but as the Godhead is in every place, from every
place symbols may be taken for It; and not being any of these things in
external properties, It can be everything in figure. Is Christ a door,
in the same sense as the doors we see made by carpenters? Surely not;
and yet He said, “I am the door.” Or a shepherd, in the same capacity as
those who guard sheep? though He said, “I am the Shepherd.” Both these
names occur in the same passage: in the Gospel, He said, that the
shepherd enters by the door: the words are, “I am the good Shepherd;”
and in the same passage, “I am the door:” <span
id="fr_4035"></span>[4036](#fn_4035.md) and who is the shepherd who enters
by the door? “I am the good Shepherd:” and what is the door by which
Thou, Good Shepherd, enterest? How then art Thou all things? In the
sense in which everything is through Me. To explain: when Paul enters by
the door, does not Christ? Wherefore? Not because Paul is Christ: but
since Christ is in Paul: and Paul acts through Christ. The Apostle says,
“Do ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me?”  <span
id="fr_4036"></span>[4037](#fn_4036.md) When His saints and faithful
disciples enter by the door, does not Christ enter by the door? How are
we to prove this? Since Saul, not yet called Paul, was persecuting those
very saints, when He called to him from Heaven, “Saul, Saul, why
persecutest thou Me?” <span id="fr_4037"></span>[4038](#fn_4037.md) Himself
then is the foundation, and corner stone: rising from the bottom: if
indeed <span id="page_421">p. 421</span> <span
id="ii.LXXXVII-Page_421"></span>from the bottom: for the base of this
foundation is the highest exaltation of the building: and as the support
of bodily fabrics rests upon the ground, that of spiritual structures
reposes on high. Were we building up ourselves upon the earth, we should
lay our foundation on the lowest level: but since our edifice is a
heavenly one, to Heaven our Foundation has gone before us: so that our
Saviour, the corner stone, the Apostles, and mighty Prophets, the hills
that bear the fabric of the city, constitute a sort of living structure.
This building now cries from your hearts; that you may be built up into
its fabric, the hand of God, as of an artificer, worketh even through my
tongue. Nor was it without a meaning that Noah’s ark was made of “square
beams,” <span id="fr_4038"></span>[4039](#fn_4038.md) which were typical of
the form of the Church. For what is it to be made square? Listen to the
resemblance of the squared stone: like qualities should the Christian
have: for in all his trials he never falls: though pushed, and, as it
were, turned over, he falls not: and thus too, whichever way a square
stone is turned, it stands erect.…In earthly cities, one thing is the
structure of buildings: another thing are the citizens that dwell
therein: that city is builded of its own inmates, who are themselves the
blocks that form the city, for the very stones are living: “Ye also,”
says the Apostle, “as living stones, are built up a spiritual
house,” <span id="fr_4039"></span>[4040](#fn_4039.md) words that are
addressed to ourselves. Let us then pursue the contemplation of that
city.

<span id="ii.LXXXVII-p17"></span>4. “The Lord loveth the gates of Sion
more than all the dwellings of Jacob” ([Psa.
87.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#002.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXVII-p17.1"></span>). I have made the foregoing remarks, that
ye may not imagine the gates are one thing, the foundations another. Why
are the Apostles and Prophets foundations? Because their authority is
the support of our weakness. Why are they gates? because through them we
enter the kingdom of God: for they proclaim it to us: and while we enter
by their means, we enter also through Christ, Himself being the Gate.
And twelve gates of Jerusalem are spoken of, <span
id="fr_4040"></span>[4041](#fn_4040.md) and the one gate is Christ, and the
twelve gates are Christ for Christ dwells in the twelve gates, hence was
twelve the number of the Apostles. There is a deep mystery in this
number of twelve: “Ye shall sit,” says our Saviour, “on twelve thrones,
judging the twelve tribes of Israel.” <span
id="fr_4041"></span>[4042](#fn_4041.md) If there are twelve thrones there,
there will be no room for the judgment-seat of Paul, the thirteenth
Apostle, though he says that he shall judge not men only, but even
Angels; which, but the fallen Angels? “Know ye not, that we shall judge
Angels,” <span id="fr_4042"></span>[4043](#fn_4042.md) he writes. The world
would answer, Why dost thou boast that thou shalt be a judge? Where will
be thy throne? Our Lord spoke of twelve thrones for the twelve Apostles:
one, Judas, fell, and his place being supplied by Matthias, the number
of twelve thrones was made up: <span
id="fr_4043"></span>[4044](#fn_4043.md) first, then, discover room for thy
judgment-seat; then threaten that thou wilt judge. Let us, therefore,
reflect upon the meaning of the twelve thrones. The expression is
typical of a sort of universality, as the Church was destined to prevail
throughout the whole world: whence this edifice is styled a building
together into Christ: and because judges come from all quarters, the
twelve thrones are spoken of, just as the twelve gates, from the
entering in from all sides into that city. Not only therefore have those
twelve, and the Apostle Paul, a claim to the twelve thrones, but, from
the universal signification, all who are to sit in judgment: in the same
manner as all who enter the city, enter by one or the other of the
twelve gates. There are four quarters of the globe: East, West, North,
and South: and they are constantly alluded to in the Scriptures. From
all those four winds; our Lord declares in the Gospel that He will call
his sheep “from the four winds;” <span
id="fr_4044"></span>[4045](#fn_4044.md) therefore from all those four winds
is the Church called. And how called? On every side it is called in the
Trinity: no otherwise is it called than by Baptism in the name of the
Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost: four then being thrice taken,
twelve are found. Knock, therefore, with all your hearts at these gates:
and let Christ cry within you: “Open me the gates of
righteousness.” <span id="fr_4045"></span>[4046](#fn_4045.md) For He went
before us the Head: He follows Himself in His Body.…

<span id="ii.LXXXVII-p24"></span>5. “Very excellent things are said of
thee, thou city of God” ([Psa.
87.3](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#003.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXVII-p24.1"></span>). He was, as it were, contemplating that
city of Jerusalem on earth: for consider what city he alludes to, of
which certain very excellent things are spoken. Now the earthly city has
been destroyed: after suffering the enemy’s rage, it fell to the earth;
it is no longer what it was: it exhibited the emblem, and the shadow
hath passed away. Whence then are “very excellent things spoken of thee,
thou city of God”? Listen whence: “I will think upon Rahab and Babylon,
with them that know Me” ([Psa.
87.4](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#004.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXVII-p24.2"></span>). In that city, the Prophet, in the person
of God, says, “I will think upon Rahab and Babylon.” Rahab belongs not
to the Jewish people; <span id="fr_4046"></span>[4047](#fn_4046.md) Babylon
belongs not to the Jewish people; as is clear from the next verse: “For
the Philistines <span id="fr_4047"></span>[4048](#fn_4047.md) also, and
Tyre, with the Ethiopians, were there.” Deservedly then, “very excellent
things are spoken of thee, thou city of God:” for not only is the Jewish
nation, born of the flesh of Abraham, <span id="page_422">p. 422</span>
<span id="ii.LXXXVII-Page_422"></span>included therein, but all nations
also, some of which are named that all may be understood. “I will
think,” he says, “upon Rahab:” who is that harlot? That harlot in
Jericho, who received the spies and conducted them out of the city by a
different road: who trusted beforehand in the promise, who feared God,
who was told to hang out of the window a line of scarlet thread, that
is, to bear upon her forehead the sign of the blood of Christ. She was
saved there, and thus represented the Church of the Gentiles: whence our
Lord said to the haughty Pharisees, “Verily I say unto you, that the
publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.” <span
id="fr_4048"></span>[4049](#fn_4048.md) They go before, because they do
violence: they push their way by faith, and to faith a way is made, nor
can any resist, since they who are violent take it by force. For it is
written, “The kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take
it by force.” <span id="fr_4049"></span>[4050](#fn_4049.md) Such was the
conduct of the robber, more courageous on the cross than in the place of
ambush. <span id="fr_4050"></span>[4051](#fn_4050.md) “I will think upon
Rahab and Babylon.” By Babylon is meant the city of this world: as there
is one holy city, Jerusalem; one unholy, Babylon: all the unholy belong
to Babylon, even as all the holy to Jerusalem. But he slideth <span
id="fr_4051"></span>[4052](#fn_4051.md) from Babylon to Jerusalem. How, but
by Him who justifieth the ungodly: Jerusalem is the city of the saints;
Babylon of the wicked: but He cometh who justifieth the ungodly: since
it is said, “I will think” not only “upon Rahab,” but “upon Babylon,”
but with whom? “with them that know Me.”…

<span id="ii.LXXXVII-p31"></span>6. Listen now to a deep mystery. Rahab
is there through Him, through whom also is Babylon, now no longer
Babylon, but beginning to be Jerusalem. The daughter is divided against
her mother, and will be among the members of that queen to whom is said,
“Forget thine own people, and thy father’s house, so shall the king have
pleasure in thy beauty.” <span id="fr_4052"></span>[4053](#fn_4052.md) For
how could Babylon aspire to Jerusalem? How could Rahab reach those
foundations? How could the Philistines, or Tyre, or the people of the
Ethiopians? Listen to this verse, “Sion, my mother, a man shall
say.” <span id="fr_4053"></span>[4054](#fn_4053.md) There is then a man who
saith this: through whom all those I have mentioned make their approach.
Who is this man? It tells if we hear, if we understand. It follows, as
if a question had been raised, through whose aid Rahab, Babylon, the
Philistines, Tyre, and the Morians, gained an entrance. Behold, through
whom they come; “Sion, my mother, a man shall say; and a man was born in
her, and Himself the Most High hath founded her” ([Psa.
87.5](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#005.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXVII-p33.3"></span>). What, my brethren, can be clearer?
Truly, because “very excellent things are spoken of thee, thou city of
God.” Lo, “Sion, O mother, a man shall say.” What man? “He who was born
in her.” <span id="fr_4054"></span>[4055](#fn_4054.md) It is then the man
who was born in her, and He Himself hath founded her. Yet how can He be
born in the city which He Himself founded? It had already been founded,
that therein He might be born. Understand it thus, if thou canst:
“Mother Sion, he shall say;” but it is “a man” that “shall say, Mother
Sion; yea, a man was born in her:” and yet “he hath founded her” (not a
man, but), “the Most High.” As He created a mother of whom He would be
born, so He founded a city in which He would be born. What hope is ours,
brethren! On our behalf the Most High, who founded the city, addresses
that city as a mother: and “He was born in her, and the Most High hath
founded her.”

<span id="ii.LXXXVII-p35"></span>7. As though it were said, How do ye
know this? All of us have sung these Psalms: and Christ, Man for our
sake, God before us, sings within us all. But is this much to say,
“before us,” of Him who was before heaven and earth and time? He then,
born for our sakes a man, in that city, also founded her when He was the
Most High. Yet how are we assured of this? “The Lord shall rehearse it
when He writeth up the people” ([Psa.
87.6](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#006.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXVII-p35.1"></span>), as the following verse has it. “The Lord
shall declare, when He writeth up the people, and their princes.” What
princes? <span id="fr_4055"></span>[4056](#fn_4055.md) “Those who were born
in her;” those princes who, born within her walls, became therein
princes: for before they could become princes in her, God chose the
despised things of the world to confound the strong. Was the fisherman,
the publican, a prince? They were indeed princes: but because they
became such in her. Princes of what kind were they? Princes come from
Babylon, believing monarchs of this world, came to the city of Rome, as
to the head of Babylon: they went not to the temple of the Emperor, but
to the tomb of the Fisherman. Whence indeed did they rank as princes?
“God chose the weak things of the world to confound the strong, and the
foolish things He hath chosen, and things which are not as though they
were, that things which are may be brought to nought.” <span
id="fr_4056"></span>[4057](#fn_4056.md) This He doth who “from the ground
raises the helpless, and from the dunghill exalts the poor.” <span
id="fr_4057"></span>[4058](#fn_4057.md) For what purpose? “That He may set
him with the princes, even with the princes of His people.” <span
id="fr_4058"></span>[4059](#fn_4058.md) This is a mighty deed, a deep
source of pleasure and exultation. Orators came later into that city,
but they could <span id="page_423">p. 423</span> <span
id="ii.LXXXVII-Page_423"></span>never have done so, had not fishermen
preceded them. These things are glorious indeed, but where could they
take place, but in that city of God, of whom very excellent things are
spoken?

<span id="ii.LXXXVII-p40"></span>8. So thus, after drawing together and
mingling every source of joyous exultation, how doth he conclude? “The
dwelling as of all that shall be made joyous is in Thee” ([Psa.
87.7](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#007.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXVII-p40.1"></span>). As if all made joyous, all rejoicing,
shall dwell in that city. Amid our journeyings here we suffer bruises:
our last home shall be the home of joy alone. Toil and groans shall
perish: prayers pass away, hymns of praise succeed. There shall be the
dwelling of the happy; no longer shall there be the groans of those that
long, but the gladness of those who enjoy. For He will be present for
whom we sigh: we shall be like Him, as we shall see Him as He is: <span
id="fr_4059"></span>[4060](#fn_4059.md) there it will be our whole task to
praise and enjoy the presence of God: and what beyond shall we ask for,
when He alone satisfies us, by whom all things were made? We shall dwell
and be dwelt in; and shall be subject to Him, that God may be all in
all. <span id="fr_4060"></span>[4061](#fn_4060.md) “Blessed,” then, “are
they that dwell in Thy house.” How blessed? Blessed in their gold, and
silver, their numerous slaves, and multiplied offspring? “Blessed are
they that dwell in Thy house: for ever and ever they will be praising
Thee.” <span id="fr_4061"></span>[4062](#fn_4061.md) Blessed in that sole
labour <span id="fr_4062"></span>[4063](#fn_4062.md) which is rest! Let
this then be the one and only object of our desire, my brethren, when we
shall have reached this pass. Let, us prepare ourselves to rejoice in
God: to praise Him. The good works which conduct us thither, will not be
needed there. I described, as far as I could, only yesterday, <span
id="fr_4063"></span>[4064](#fn_4063.md) our condition there: works of
charity there will be none, where there will be no misery: thou shalt
not find one in want, one naked, no one will meet you tormented with
thirst, there will be no stranger, no sick to visit, no dead to bury, no
disputants to set at peace. What then wilt thou find to do? Shall we
plant new vines, plough, traffic, make voyages, to support the
necessities of the body? Deep quiet shall be there; all toilsome work,
that necessity demands, will cease: the necessity being dead, its works
will perish too. What then will be our state? As far as possible, the
tongue of a man thus told us. “As it were, the dwelling of all who shall
be made perfect is in Thee.” <span id="fr_4064"></span>[4065](#fn_4064.md)
Why does he say, “as it were”? Because there shall be such joy there as
we know not here. Many pleasures do I behold here, and many rejoice in
this world, some in one thing, others in another; but there is nothing
to compare with that delight, but it shall be “as it were” being made
joyful. For if I say joyfulness, men at once think of such joyfulness as
men use to have in wine, in feasting, in avarice, and in the world’s
distinctions. For men are elated by these things, and mad with a kind of
joy: but “there is no joy, saith the Lord, unto the wicked.” <span
id="fr_4065"></span>[4066](#fn_4065.md) There is a sort of joyfulness which
the ear of man hath not heard, nor his eye seen, nor hath it entered
into his heart to conceive. <span id="fr_4066"></span>[4067](#fn_4066.md)
“As it were, the dwelling of all who shall be made joyful is in Thee.”
Let us prepare for other delights: for a kind of shadow is what we find
here, not the reality: that we may not expect to enjoy such things there
as here we delight in: otherwise our self-denial will be avarice. Some
persons, when invited to a rich banquet, where there are many and costly
dishes yet to come on, abstain from breaking their fast: if you ask the
reason, they tell you that they are fasting: which is indeed a great
work, a Christian work. Yet be not hasty in praising them: examine their
motives: it is their belly, not religion, that they are consulting. That
their appetite may not be palled by ordinary dishes, they abstain till
more delicate food is set before them. This fast then is for the
gullet’s sake. Fasting is undoubtedly important: it fights against the
belly and the palate; but sometimes it fights for them. Thus, my
brethren, if ye imagine that we shall find any such pleasures in that
country to which the heavenly trumpet urges us on, and on that account
abstain from present enjoyments, that ye may receive the like more
plentifully there, ye imitate those I have described, who fast only for
greater feasting, and abstain only for greater indulgence. Do not ye
like this: prepare yourselves for a certain ineffable delight: cleanse
your hearts from all earthly and secular affections. We shall see
something, the sight of which will make us blessed: and that alone will
suffice for us. What then? Shall we not eat? Yes: we shall eat: but that
shall be our food, which will ever refresh, and never fail. “In Thee is
the dwelling of all who shall be, as it were, made joyful.” He has
already told us how we shall be made joyful. “Blessed are they that
dwell in thy house: for ever and ever they will be praising Thee.” <span
id="fr_4067"></span>[4068](#fn_4067.md) Let us praise the Lord as far as we
are able, but with mingled lamentations: for while we praise we long for
Him, and as yet have Him not. When we have, all our sorrows will be
taken from us, and nothing will remain but praise, unmixed and
everlasting. Now let us pray. <span id="fr_4068"></span>[4069](#fn_4068.md)
