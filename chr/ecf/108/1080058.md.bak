<span id="ii.XLIX.2"></span>

<span id="ii.XLIX.2-p1"></span> *The Second Part.*

<span id="ii.XLIX.2-p2"></span>1. “Like sheep laid in hell, death is
their shepherd” ([Psa. 49.14](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#014.md)<span
id="ii.XLIX.2-p2.1"></span>). Whose? Of those whose way is a
stumbling-block to themselves. Whose? Of those who mind only things
present, while they think not of things future: of those who think not
of any life, but of that which must be called death. Not without cause,
then, like sheep in hell, have they death to their shepherd. What
meaneth, “they have death to their shepherd”? For is death either some
thing or some power? Yea, death is either the separation of the soul
from the body, or a separation of the soul from God, <span
id="fr_1647"></span>[1648](#fn_1647.md) and that indeed which men fear is
the separation of the soul from the body: but the real death, which men
do not fear, is the separation of the soul from God. And ofttimes when
men fear that which doth separate the soul from the body, they fall into
that wherein the soul is separated from God. This then is death. But how
is “death their shepherd”? If Christ is life, the devil is death. But we
read in many places in Scripture, how that Christ is life. But the devil
is death, not because he is himself death, but because through him is
death. For whether that (death) wherein Adam fell was given man to drink
by the persuasion of him: or whether that wherein the soul is separated
from the body, still they have him for the author thereof, who first
falling through pride envied him who stood, and overthrew him who stood
with an invisible death, in order that he might have to pay <span
id="fr_1648"></span>[1649](#fn_1648.md) the visible death. They who belong
to him have death to their shepherd: but we who think of future
immortality, and not without reason do wear the sign of the Cross of
Christ on the forehead, have no shepherd but life. Of unbelievers death
is the shepherd, of believers life is the shepherd. If then in hell are
the sheep, whose shepherd is death, in heaven are the sheep, whose
shepherd is life. What then? Are we now in heaven? In heaven we are by
faith. For if not in heaven, where is the “Lift up your heart”? If not
in heaven, whence with the Apostle Paul, “For our conversation is in
heaven”? <span id="fr_1649"></span>[1650](#fn_1649.md) In body we walk on
earth, in heart we dwell in heaven. We dwell there, if thither we send
anything which holdeth us there. For no one dwelleth in heart, save
where thought is: but there his thought is, where his treasure is. He
hath treasured on earth, his heart doth not withdraw from earth: he hath
treasured in heaven, his heart from heaven doth not come down: for the
Lord saith plainly, “Where thy treasure is, there will thy heart be
also.”  <span id="fr_1650"></span>[1651](#fn_1650.md)

<span id="ii.XLIX.2-p7"></span>2. They, then, whose shepherd is death,
seem to flourish for a time, and the righteous to labour: but why?
Because it is yet night. What meaneth, it is night? The merits of the
righteous appear not, and the felicity of the unrighteous hath, as it
were, a name. So long as it is winter, grass appeareth more verdant than
a tree. For grass flourisheth through the winter, a tree is as it were
dry through the winter: when in summer time the sun hath come forth with
greater heat, the tree, which seemed dry through the winter, is bursting
with leaves, and putteth forth fruits, but the grass withereth: thou
wilt see the honour of the tree, the grass is dried. So also now the
righteous labour, before that summer cometh. There is life in the root,
it doth not yet appear in the branches. But our root is love. And what
saith the Apostle? That we ought to have our root above, in order that
life may be our shepherd, because our dwelling ought not to quit heaven,
because in this earth we ought to walk as if dead; so that living above,
below we may be dead; not so as that being dead above, we may live
below.…Our labour shall appear in the morning, and there shall be fruit
in the morning: so that they that now labour shall hereafter reign, and
they that now boast them and are proud, shall hereafter be brought
under. For what followeth? “Like sheep laid in hell, death is their
shepherd; and the righteous shall reign over them in the morning.”

<span id="ii.XLIX.2-p8"></span>3. Endure thou the night, yearn for the
morning. Think not because the night hath <span id="page_175">p.
175</span> <span id="ii.XLIX.2-Page_175"></span>life, the morning too
hath not life. Doth then he that sleepeth live, and he that riseth live
not? Is not he that sleepeth more like death? <span
id="fr_1651"></span>[1652](#fn_1651.md) And who are they that sleep? They
whom the Apostle Paul rouseth, if they choose but to awake. For to
certain he saith, “Awake, thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead,
and Christ shall give thee light.” <span
id="fr_1652"></span>[1653](#fn_1652.md) They then that are lightened by
Christ watch now, but the fruit of their watchings appeareth not yet: in
the morning it shall appear, that is, when doubtful things of this world
shall have passed away. For these are very night: for do they not appear
to thee like darkness?…But they on whom men have trampled, and who were
ridiculed for believing, shall hear from Life Itself, whom they have for
shepherd, “Come, ye blessed of My Father, receive the kingdom which was
prepared for you from the foundation of the world.” Therefore the
righteous “shall reign over them,” not now, but “in the morning.” Let no
one say, Wherefore am I a Christian? I rule no one, <span
id="fr_1653"></span>[1654](#fn_1653.md) I would rule the wicked. Be not in
haste, thou shalt reign, but “in the morning.” “And the help of them
shall grow old in hell from their glory.” Now they have glory, in hell
they shall grow old. What is “the help of them”? Help from money, help
from friends, help from their own might. But when a man shall be dead,
“in that day shall perish all his thoughts.” <span
id="fr_1654"></span>[1655](#fn_1654.md) How great glory he seemed to have
among men, while he lived, so great oldness and decay of punishments
shall he have, when he shall be dead in hell.

<span id="ii.XLIX.2-p13"></span>4. “Nevertheless, God shall redeem my
soul” ([Psa. 49.15](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#015.md)<span
id="ii.XLIX.2-p13.1"></span>). Behold the voice of one hoping in the
future: “Nevertheless, God shall redeem my soul.” <span
id="fr_1655"></span>[1656](#fn_1655.md) Perhaps it is the voice of one
still wishing to be relieved from oppression. Some one is in prison, he
saith, “God shall redeem my soul:” some one is in bond, “God shall
redeem my soul:” some one is suffering peril by sea, is being tossed by
waves and raging tempests, what saith he? “God shall redeem my soul.”
They would be delivered for the sake of this life. Not such is the voice
of this man. Hear what followeth: “God shall redeem my soul from the
hand of hell, when He shall have received me.” He is speaking of this
redemption, which Christ now showeth in Himself. For He hath descended
into hell, and hath ascended into heaven. What we have seen in the Head
we have found in the Body. For what we have believed in the Head, they
that have seen, have themselves told us, and by themselves we have seen:
“For we are” all “one body.” <span id="fr_1656"></span>[1657](#fn_1656.md)
But are they better that hear, we worse to whom it hath been told? Not
so saith The Life Itself, Our Shepherd Himself. For He rebuketh a
certain disciple of His, doubting and desiring to handle His scars, and
when he had handled the scars and had cried out, saying, “My Lord and my
God,” <span id="fr_1657"></span>[1658](#fn_1657.md) seeing His disciple
doubting, and looking to the whole world about to believe, “Because thou
hast seen Me,” He saith, “thou hast believed: blessed are they that see
not, and believe.” “But God shall redeem my soul from the land of hell,
when He hath received me.” Here then what? Labour, oppression,
tribulation, temptation: expect nothing else. Where joy? In future
hope.…

<span id="ii.XLIX.2-p17"></span>5. …Perchance thy heart saith, Wretch
that I am, I suppose to no purpose I have believed, God doth not regard
things human. God therefore doth awaken us: and He saith what? “Fear
not, though a man have become rich” ([Psa.
49.16](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#016.md)<span
id="ii.XLIX.2-p17.1"></span>). For why didst thou fear, because a man
hath become rich? Thou didst fear that thou hadst believed to no
purpose, that perchance thou shouldest have lost the labour for thy
faith, and the hope of thy conversion: because perchance there hath come
in thy way gain with guilt, and thou couldest have been rich, if thou
hadst seized upon that same gain with the guilt, and neededst not have
laboured; and thou, remembering what God hath threatened, hast refrained
from guilt, and hast contemned the gain: thou seest another man that
hath made gain by guilt, and hath suffered no harm; and thou fearest to
be good. “Fear not,” saith the Spirit of God to thee, “though a man
shall have become rich.” Wouldest thou not have eyes but for things
present? Things future He hath promised, who hath risen again; peace in
this world, and repose in this life, He hath not promised. Every man
doth seek repose; a good thing he is seeking, but not in the proper
region thereof he is seeking it. There is no peace in this life; in
Heaven hath been promised that which on earth we are seeking: in the
world to come hath been promised that which in this world we are
seeking.

<span id="ii.XLIX.2-p18"></span>6. “Fear not, though a man be made rich,
and though the glory of his house be multiplied.” Wherefore “fear not”?
“For when he shall die, he shall not receive anything” ([Psa.
49.17](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#017.md)<span
id="ii.XLIX.2-p18.1"></span>). Thou seest him living, consider him
dying. Thou markest what he hath here, mark what he taketh with him.
What doth he take with him? He hath store of gold, he hath store of
silver, numerous estates, slaves: he dieth, these remain, he knoweth not
for whom. For though he leaveth them for whom he will, he keepeth them
not for whom he will. For many <span id="page_176">p. 176</span> <span
id="ii.XLIX.2-Page_176"></span>have gained even what was not left them,
and many have lost what was left them. All these things then remain, and
he taketh with him what? Perhaps some one saith, He taketh that with him
in which he is wound, and that which is expended upon him for a costly
and marble tomb, to erect a monument, this he taketh with him. I say,
not even this. For these things are presented to him without his feeling
them. If thou deckest a man sleeping and not awake, he hath the
decorations with him on the couch: perhaps the decorations are resting
upon the body of him as he lieth, and perhaps he seeth himself in
tatters during sleep. What he feeleth is more to him than what he
feeleth not. Though even this when he shall have awaked will not be: yet
to him sleeping, that which he saw in sleep was more than that which he
felt not. Why then, brethren, should <span
id="fr_1658"></span>[1659](#fn_1658.md) men say to themselves, Let money be
spent at my death: why do I leave my heirs rich? Many things will they
have of mine, let me too have something of my own for my body. What
shall a dead body have? what shall rotting flesh have? what shall flesh
not feeling have? If that rich man had anything, whose tongue was dry,
then man hath something of his own. My brethren, do we read in the
Gospel, that this rich man appeared in the fire with all-silken and
fine-linen coverings? Was he of such sort in hell as he was in feastings
at table? When he thirsted and desired a drop, all those things were not
there. Therefore man carrieth not with him anything, nor doth the dead
take with him that which the burial taketh. For where feeling is, there
is the man; where is no feeling, the man is not. There lieth fallen the
vessel which contained the man, the house which held the man. The body
let us call the house, the spirit let us call the inhabitant of the
house. The spirit is tormented in hell: what doth it profit him, that
the body lieth in spices and perfumes, wound in costly linens? just as
if the master of the house should be sent into banishment, and thou
shouldest garnish the walls of his house. He in banishment is in need,
and doth faint with hunger, he scarce findeth to himself one hovel where
he may snatch a sleep, and thou sayest, “Happy is he, for his house hath
been garnished.” Who would not judge that thou wast either jesting or
wast mad? Thou dost garnish the body, the spirit is tormented. Give
something to the spirit, and ye have given something to the dead man.
But what wilt thou give him, when he desired one drop, and received not?
For the man scorned to send before him anything. Wherefore scorned?
“because this their way is a stumbling-block to them.” <span
id="fr_1659"></span>[1660](#fn_1659.md) He minded not any but the present
life, he thought not but how he might be buried, wound in costly
vestments. His soul was taken from him, as the Lord saith: “Thou fool,
this night thy soul shall be taken from thee, and whose shall those
things be which thou hast provided?” <span
id="fr_1660"></span>[1661](#fn_1660.md) And that is fulfilled which this
Psalm saith: “Fear not, though a man be made rich, and though the glory
of his house be multiplied: for when he shall die he shall not receive
anything, nor shall his glory descend together with him.”

<span id="ii.XLIX.2-p22"></span>7. Let your love observe: “For his soul
shall be blessed in his life” ([Psa.
49.18](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#018.md)<span
id="ii.XLIX.2-p22.1"></span>). As long as he lived he did well for
himself. This all men say, but say falsely. It is a blessing from the
mind of the blesser, not from the truth itself. For what sayest thou?
Because he ate and drank, because he did what he chose, because he
feasted sumptuously, therefore he did well with himself. I say, he did
ill for himself. Not I say, but Christ. He did ill for himself. For that
rich man, when he feasted sumptuously every day, was supposed to do well
with himself: but when he began to burn in hell, then that which was
supposed to be well was found to be ill. For what he had eaten with men
above, <span id="fr_1661"></span>[1662](#fn_1661.md) he digested in hell
beneath. Unrighteousness I mean, brethren, on which he used to feast. He
used to eat costly banquets with the mouth of flesh, with his heart’s
mouth he used to eat unrighteousness. What he ate with his heart’s mouth
with men above, this he digested amid those punishments in the places
beneath. And verily he had eaten for a time, he digested ill for
everlasting. Is then unrighteousness eaten? perhaps some one saith: what
is it that he saith? Unrighteousness eaten? It is not I that say: hear
the Scripture: “As a sour grape is vexation to the teeth, and smoke to
the eyes, so is unrighteousness to them that use it.” <span
id="fr_1662"></span>[1663](#fn_1662.md) For he that shall have eaten
unrighteousness, that is, he that shall have had unrighteousness
wilfully, shall not be able to eat righteousness. For righteousness is
bread. Who is bread? “I am the living bread which came down from
heaven.” <span id="fr_1663"></span>[1664](#fn_1663.md) Himself is the bread
of our heart.…Is then even righteousness eaten? If it were not eaten,
the Lord would not have said, “Blessed are they which do hunger and
thirst after righteousness.” <span id="fr_1664"></span>[1665](#fn_1664.md)
Therefore “since his soul shall be blessed in life,” in life it “shall”
be blessed, in death it shall be tormented.…

<span id="ii.XLIX.2-p27"></span>8. “He shall confess to Thee, when Thou
shalt have done him good.” Be not of such sort, brethren: see ye how
that to this end we say these words, to this end we sing, to this end we
treat, to this end toil—do not these things. Your business doth prove
you: sometimes in <span id="page_177">p. 177</span> <span
id="ii.XLIX.2-Page_177"></span>your business ye hear the truth, and ye
blaspheme. The Church ye blaspheme. Wherefore? Because ye are
Christians. “If so it be, I betake myself to Donatus’s party: I will be
a heathen.” <span id="fr_1665"></span>[1666](#fn_1665.md) Wherefore?
Because thou hast eaten bread, and the teeth are in pain. When thou
sawest the bread itself, thou didst praise; thou beginnest to eat, and
the teeth are in pain; that is, when thou wast hearing the Word of God
thou didst praise: when it is said to thee, “Do this,” thou blasphemest:
do not so ill: say this, “The bread is good, but I cannot eat it.” But
now if thou seest with the eyes, thou praisest: when thou beginnest to
close the teeth thou sayest, “Bad is this bread, and like him that made
it.” So it cometh to pass that thou confessest to God, when God doeth
thee good and thou liest when thou singest, “I will alway bless God, His
praise is ever in my mouth.” <span id="fr_1666"></span>[1667](#fn_1666.md)
How alway? If alway gain, alway He is blessed: if sometime there is
loss, He is not blessed, but blasphemed. Forsooth thou blessest alway,
forsooth His praise is ever in thy mouth! Thou wilt be such as just now
he describeth: “He will confess to Thee, when Thou shalt have done him
good.”

<span id="ii.XLIX.2-p30"></span>9. “He shall enter even unto the
generations of his fathers” ([Psa.
49.19](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#019.md)<span
id="ii.XLIX.2-p30.1"></span>): that is, he shall imitate his fathers.
For the unrighteous, that now are, have brothers, have fathers.
Unrighteous men of old, are the fathers of the present; and they that
are now unrighteous, are the fathers of unrighteous posterity: just as
the fathers of the righteous, the righteous of old, are the fathers of
the righteous that now are; and they that now are, are the fathers of
them that are to be. The Holy Spirit hath willed to show that
righteousness is not evil when men murmur against her: but these men
have their father from the beginning, even to the generation of their
fathers. Two men Adam begat, and in one was unrighteousness, in one was
righteousness: unrighteousness in Cain, righteousness in Abel. <span
id="fr_1667"></span>[1668](#fn_1667.md) Unrighteousness seemed to prevail
over righteousness, because Cain unrighteous slew Abel righteous <span
id="fr_1668"></span>[1669](#fn_1668.md) in the night. Is it so in the
morning? Nay, “but the righteous shall reign over them in the
morning.” <span id="fr_1669"></span>[1670](#fn_1669.md) The morning shall
come, and it shall be seen where Abel is, and where Cain. So all men who
are after Cain, and so all who are after Abel, even unto the end of the
world. “He shall enter even unto the generations of his fathers: even to
eternity he shall not see light.” Because even when he was here, he was
in darkness, taking pleasure in false goods, and not loving real goods:
even so he shall go hence into hell: from the darkness of his dreams the
darkness of torments shall receive him. Therefore, “even to eternity he
shall not see light.”

<span id="ii.XLIX.2-p34"></span>But wherefore this? What he hath written
in the middle of the Psalm, <span id="fr_1670"></span>[1671](#fn_1670.md)
the same also he hath writ at the end: “Man, though he was in honour,
understood not, was compared to the beasts without sense, and was made
like to them” ([Psa. 49.20](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#020.md)<span
id="ii.XLIX.2-p35.2"></span>). But ye, brethren, consider that ye be men
made after the image and likeness of God. The image <span
id="fr_1671"></span>[1672](#fn_1671.md) of God is within, is not in the
body; is not in these ears which ye see, and eyes, and nostrils, and
palate, and hands, and feet; but is made nevertheless: <span
id="fr_1672"></span>[1673](#fn_1672.md) wherein is the intellect, wherein
is the mind, wherein the power of discovering truth, wherein is faith,
wherein is your hope, wherein your charity, there God hath His Image:
there at least ye perceive and see that these things pass away; for so
he hath said in another Psalm, “Though man walketh in an image, yet he
is disquieted in vain: he heapeth up treasures, and knoweth not for whom
he shall gather them.” <span id="fr_1673"></span>[1674](#fn_1673.md) Be not
disquieted, for of whatsoever kind these things be, they are transitory,
if ye are men who being in honour understand. For if being men in honour
ye understand not, ye are compared to the beasts without sense, and are
made like to them.
