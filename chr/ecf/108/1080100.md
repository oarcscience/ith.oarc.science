<span id="ii.LXXXIX-p1"></span> <span id="ii.LXXXIX-p1.1"></span><span
class="c20"><span id="ii.LXXXIX-p1.2"></span>Psalm LXXXIX. <span
id="fr_4128"></span>[4129](#fn_4128.md) </span>

<span id="ii.LXXXIX-p3"></span>1. Understand, beloved, this Psalm, which
I am about to explain, by the grace of God, of our hope in the Lord
Jesus Christ, and be of good cheer, because He who promised, will fulfil
all, as He has fulfilled much: for it is not our own merit, but His
mercy, that gives us confidence in Him. He Himself is meant, in my
belief, by “the understanding of Æthan the Israelite:” <span
id="fr_4129"></span>[4130](#fn_4129.md) which has given this Psalm its
title. You see then, who is meant by Æthan: but the meaning of the word
is “strong.” No man in this world is strong, except in the hope of God’s
promises: for as to our own deservings, we are weak, in His mercy we are
strong. Weak then in himself, strong in God’s mercy, the Psalmist thus
begins: “I will sing of Thy mercies, O Lord, for ever: with my mouth
will I make known Thy truth unto all generations” ([Psa.
89.1](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#001.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXIX-p4.2"></span>).

<span id="ii.LXXXIX-p5"></span>2. Let my limbs, he saith, serve the
Lord: I speak, but it is of Thine I speak. “With my mouth will I make
known Thy truth:” if I obey not Thee, I am not Thy servant: if I speak
on my own part, I am a liar. To speak then from Thee, <span
id="fr_4130"></span>[4131](#fn_4130.md) and in my own person, are two
things: one mine, one Thine: Truth Thine, language mine. Let us hear
then what faithfulness he maketh known, what mercies he singeth.

<span id="ii.LXXXIX-p7"></span>3. “For Thou hast said, Mercy shall be
built up for ever” ([Psa. 89.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#002.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXIX-p7.1"></span>). It is this that I sing: this is Thy truth,
for the making known of which my mouth serveth. In such wise Thou
sayest, I build, as not to destroy: for some Thou destroyest and
buildest not; and some whom Thou destroyest Thou dost rebuild. For
unless there were some who were destroyed to be rebuilt, Jeremiah would
not have written, “See, I have this day set thee to throw down and to
build.” <span id="fr_4131"></span>[4132](#fn_4131.md) And indeed all who
formerly worshipped images and stones could not be built up in Christ,
without being destroyed as to their old error. While, unless some were
destroyed not to be built up, it would not be written, “He shall destroy
them, and not build them up.” <span id="fr_4132"></span>[4133](#fn_4132.md)
… In what follows, he joins these two words, mercy and faithfulness;
“For Thou hast said, Mercy shall be built up for ever: Thy truth shall
be established in the Heavens:” in which mercy and truth are repeated,
“for all the ways of the Lord are mercy and truth,” <span
id="fr_4133"></span>[4134](#fn_4133.md) for truth in the fulfilment of
promises could not be shown, unless mercy in the remission of sins
preceded. Next, as many <span id="page_430">p. 430</span> <span
id="ii.LXXXIX-Page_430"></span>things were promised in prophecy even to
the people of Israel that came according to the flesh from the seed of
Abraham, and that people was increased that the promises of God might be
fulfilled in it; while yet God did not close the fountain of His
goodness even to the Gentiles, whom He had placed under the rule of the
Angels, while He reserved the people of Israel as His own portion: the
Apostle expressly mentions the Lord’s mercy and truth as referring to
these two parties. For he calls Christ “a minister of the Circumcision
for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the
fathers.” <span id="fr_4134"></span>[4135](#fn_4134.md) See how God
deceived not; see how He cast not off His people, whom He foreknew. For
while the Apostle is treating of the fall of the Jews, to prevent any
from believing them so far disowned <span
id="fr_4135"></span>[4136](#fn_4135.md) of God, that no wheat from that
floor’s fanning could reach the granary, he saith, “God hath not cast
away His people, whom He foreknew; for I also am an Israelite.” <span
id="fr_4136"></span>[4137](#fn_4136.md) If all that nation are thorns, how
am I who speak unto you wheat? So that the truth of God was fulfilled in
those Israelites who believed, and one wall from the circumcision is
thus brought to meet the corner stone. But this stone would not form a
corner, unless it received another wall from the Gentiles: so that the
former wall relates in a special manner to the truth, the latter to the
mercy of God. “Now I say,” says the Apostle, “that Jesus Christ was a
minister of the Circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the
promise made unto the fathers: and that the Gentiles might glorify God
for His mercy.” <span id="fr_4137"></span>[4138](#fn_4137.md) Justly then
is it added, “Thy truth shalt Thou stablish in the Heavens:” for all
those Israelites who were called to be Apostles became as Heavens which
declare the glory of God: as it is written by them, “The Heavens declare
the glory of God, and the firmament showeth His handywork.” <span
id="fr_4138"></span>[4139](#fn_4138.md) …Since, although they were taken up
from hence before the Church filled the whole world, yet as “their words
reached to the ends of the world,” we are right in supposing this which
we have just read, “Thy truth shalt Thou stablish in the Heavens,”
fulfilled in them.

<span id="ii.LXXXIX-p16"></span>4. “Thou hast said, I have made a
covenant with My chosen” ([Psa.
89.3](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#003.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXIX-p16.1"></span>). What covenant, but the new, by which we
are renewed to a fresh inheritance, in our longing desire and love of
which we sing a new song. “I have made a covenant with My chosen,” saith
the Psalmist: “I have sworn unto David My servant.” How confidently does
he speak, who understands, whose mouth serves truth! I speak without
fear; since “Thou hast said.” If Thou makest me fearless, because Thou
hast said, how much more so dost Thou make me, when Thou hast sworn! For
the oath of God is the assurance of a promise. Man is justly forbidden
to swear: <span id="fr_4139"></span>[4140](#fn_4139.md) lest by the habit
of swearing, since a man may be deceived, he fall into perjury. God
alone swears securely, because He alone is infallible.

<span id="ii.LXXXIX-p18"></span>5. Let us see then what God hath sworn.
“I have sworn,” He saith, “to David My servant; thy seed will I
establish for ever” ([Psa. 89.4](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#004.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXIX-p18.1"></span>). But what is the seed of David, but that
of Abraham. And what is the seed of Abraham? “And to thy seed,” He
saith, “which is Christ.” <span id="fr_4140"></span>[4141](#fn_4140.md) But
perhaps that Christ, the Head of the Church, the Saviour of the
body, <span id="fr_4141"></span>[4142](#fn_4141.md) is the seed of Abraham,
and therefore of David; but we are not Abraham’s seed? We are assuredly;
as the Apostle saith, “And if ye be Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s
seed, and heirs according to the promise.” <span
id="fr_4142"></span>[4143](#fn_4142.md) In this sense, then, let us take
the words, brethren, “Thy seed will I stablish for ever,” not only of
that Flesh of Christ, born of the Virgin Mary, but also of all of us who
believe in Christ, for we are limbs of that Head. This body cannot be
deprived of its Head: if the Head is in glory for ever, so are the
limbs, so that Christ remains entire for ever. “Thy seed will I stablish
for ever: and set up thy throne to generation and generation.” We
suppose he saith, “for ever,” because it is “to generation and
generation:” since he has said above, with “my mouth will I ever be
showing Thy truth to generation and generation.” What is “to generation
and generation”? To every generation: for the word needed not as many
repetitions, as the coming and passing away of the several generations.
The multiplication of generations is signified and set forth to notice
by the repetition. Are possibly two generations to be understood, as ye
are aware, my beloved brethren, and as I have before explained? for
there is now a generation of flesh and blood: there will be a future
generation in the resurrection of the dead. Christ is proclaimed here:
He will be proclaimed <span id="fr_4143"></span>[4144](#fn_4143.md) there:
here He is proclaimed, that He may be believed in: there, He will be
welcomed, that He may be seen. “I will set up Thy throne from one
generation to another.” Christ hath now a throne in us, His throne is
set up in us: for unless he sat enthroned within us, He would not rule
us: but if we were not ruled by Him, we should be thrown down by
ourselves. He therefore sits within us, reigning over us: He sits also
in another generation, which will come from the resurrection of the
dead. Christ will reign for ever over His Saints. God has promised this;
He hath said it: if this is not enough, God hath sworn it. As then the
promise is certain, not on account of our deserv<span id="page_431">p.
431</span> <span id="ii.LXXXIX-Page_431"></span>ings, but of His pity,
no one ought to be afraid in proclaiming that which he cannot doubt of.
Let that strength then inspire our hearts, whence Æthan received his
name, “strong in heart:” let us preach the truth of God, the utterance
of God, His promises, His oath; and let us, strengthened on every side
by these means, glorify God, and by bearing Him along with us, become
Heavens.

<span id="ii.LXXXIX-p23"></span>6. “O Lord, the very Heavens shall
praise Thy wondrous works” ([Psa.
89.5](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#005.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXIX-p23.1"></span>). The Heavens will not praise their own
merits, but Thy wondrous works, O Lord. For in every act of mercy on the
lost, of justification of the unrighteous, what do we praise but the
wondrous works of God? Thou praisest Him, because the dead have risen:
praise Him yet more, because the lost are redeemed. What grace, what
mercy of God! Thou seest a man yesterday a whirlpool of drunkenness,
to-day an ornament of sobriety: a man yesterday the sink of luxury,
to-day the beauty of temperance: yesterday a blasphemer of God, to-day
His praiser: yesterday the slave of the creature, to-day the worshipper
of the Creator. From all these desperate states men are thus converted:
let them not look at their own merits: let them become Heavens, and
praise the wondrous works of Him by whom they were made Heavens.…

<span id="ii.LXXXIX-p24"></span>7. “For who is he among the clouds, who
shall be compared unto Thee, Lord!” ([Psa.
89.6](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#006.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXIX-p24.1"></span>). Is this to be the praise of the Heavens,
is this to be their rain? What? are the preachers confident, because
“none among the clouds shall be compared unto the Lord”? Does it appear
to you, brethren, a high ground of praise, that the clouds cannot be
compared with their Creator? If it is taken in its literal, not in its
mystical meaning, it is not so: what? are the stars that are above the
clouds to be compared with the Lord? what? can the Sun, Moon, Angels,
Heavens, be even compared with the Lord? Why is it then that he says, as
if he meant some high praise, “For who is he among the clouds?” etc. We
understand, my brethren, those clouds, as the Heavens, to be the
preachers of truth; Prophets, Apostles, the announcers of the word of
God.…If therefore the clouds are the preachers of the truth, let us
first enquire why they are clouds. For the same men are Heavens and
clouds: Heavens from the brightness of the truth, clouds from the hidden
things of the flesh: for all clouds are obscure, owing to their
mortality: and they come and go. It is on account of these very
obscurities of the flesh, that is, of the clouds, that the Apostle
saith, “Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come,
who will bring to light the hidden things of darkness.”  <span
id="fr_4144"></span>[4145](#fn_4144.md) You see at this moment what a man
is saying: but what he has in his heart, you cannot see: what is forced
from the cloud, you see, what is kept within the cloud, you see not. For
whose eyes pierce the cloud? The clouds therefore are the preachers of
the truth in the flesh. The Creator of all things Himself came in the
flesh.…We are called clouds on account of the flesh, and we are
preachers of the truth on account of the showers of the clouds: but our
flesh comes in one way, His by another. We too are called sons of God,
but He is the Son of God in another sense. His cloud comes from a
Virgin, He is the Son from eternity, co-eternal <span
id="fr_4145"></span>[4146](#fn_4145.md) with the Father. “Who is he then
among the clouds, that shall be compared unto the Lord? and what is he
among the sons of God, that shall be like unto the Lord?” Let the Lord
Himself say whether He can find one like unto Himself. “Whom do men say
that I the Son of Man am?” Because I appear, because I am seen, because
I walk among you, and perhaps at present I am become common; say, whom
do men say that I the Son of Man am? Surely when they see a son of man,
they see a cloud; but say, “Whom do men say that I am?” In answer they
gave Him the reports of men; “Some say that Thou art John the Baptist:
some Elias, and others Jeremias, or one of the prophets.” Many clouds
and sons of God are here mentioned: for because they were righteous and
holy, as the sons of God, Jeremias, Elias, and John are called also sons
of God: in their character of preachers of God, they are styled clouds.
Ye have said what clouds men imagine Me to be: do ye too say, “Whom say
ye that I am?” Peter replying in behalf of all, one for those who were
one, <span id="fr_4146"></span>[4147](#fn_4146.md) answered, “Thou art the
Christ, the Son of the living God;” <span
id="fr_4147"></span>[4148](#fn_4147.md) not like those sons of God who are
not made equal to Thee: Thou hast come in the flesh: but not as the
clouds, who are not to be compared unto Thee.

<span id="ii.LXXXIX-p29"></span>8. …“God is very greatly to be feared in
the counsel of the righteous, and to be had in dread of all them that
are round about Him” ([Psa. 89.7](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#007.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXIX-p29.1"></span>). God is everywhere; who therefore are
round about Him, who is everywhere? For if He has some round about Him,
He is represented as finite on every side. Moreover, if it is truly said
to God <span id="fr_4148"></span>[4149](#fn_4148.md) and of God, “of His
greatness there is no end;” <span id="fr_4149"></span>[4150](#fn_4149.md)
who remain, who are round about Him, except because He who is
everywhere, chose to be born of the flesh on one spot, to dwell among
one nation, in one place to be crucified, from one spot to rise again
and ascend into Heaven. Where He did this, the Gentiles are round about
Him. If He remained <span id="page_432">p. 432</span> <span
id="ii.LXXXIX-Page_432"></span>where He did these things, He would not
be “great, and be had in dread of all them that are round about Him;”
but since He preached when there in such a manner as to send preachers
of His own name through all nations over the whole world; by working
miracles among His servants, He is become “great, and to be had in dread
of all them that are round about Him.”

<span id="ii.LXXXIX-p32"></span>9. “O Lord God of Hosts, who is like
unto Thee? Thy truth, most mighty Lord, is on every side” ([Psa.
89.8](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#008.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXIX-p32.1"></span>). Great is Thy power: Thou hast made Heaven
and earth, and all things that in them are: but greater still is thy
loving-kindness, which has shown forth Thy truth to all around Thee. For
if Thou hadst been preached only on the spot where Thou didst deign to
be born, to suffer, to rise again, to ascend; the truth of that promise
of God would have been fulfilled, to confirm the promises made unto the
fathers: but the promise, “that the Gentiles may glorify God for His
mercy,” <span id="fr_4150"></span>[4151](#fn_4150.md) would not have been
fulfilled, had not that truth been explained, and diffused to those
around Thee from the spot where Thou didst deign to appear. On that spot
Thou didst thunder out of Thy own cloud: but to scatter rain upon the
Gentiles round about, Thou hast sent other clouds. Truly in Thy power
hast Thou fulfilled what Thou hast said, “Hereafter shall ye see the Son
of Man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of
Heaven.”  <span id="fr_4151"></span>[4152](#fn_4151.md)

<span id="ii.LXXXIX-p35"></span>10. …For ye have heard, like men
accustomed to the watering of the clouds of God, “Thy truth” then “is in
the circuit of Thee.” But when without persecutions, when without
opposition, since it is said, that “He was born for a sign which shall
be spoken against”? <span id="fr_4152"></span>[4153](#fn_4152.md) Since
then that nation, where Thou didst deign to be born, and to dwell, was
as a land separated from the waves of the heathen, so that it appeared
dry and ready for watering with rain, while the rest of the nations were
as a sea in the bitterness of their sterility; what do Thy preachers who
scatter Thy truth in circuit of Thee, when the waves of that sea rage
furiously? “Thou rulest the power of the sea” ([Psa.
89.9](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#009.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXIX-p36.2"></span>). For what was the result of the sea raging
thus, but the day which we are now keeping holy? It slew Martyrs,
scattered seeds of blood, the harvest of the Church sprang up. Safely
then let the clouds go forth: let them diffuse Thy truth in circuit of
Thee, let them not fear the savage waves. “Thou rulest the power of the
sea.” The sea swells, buffets, and roars: but “God is faithful, who will
not suffer you to be tempted beyond what ye are able:”  <span
id="fr_4153"></span>[4154](#fn_4153.md) and so, “Thou stillest the waves
thereof when they rise.”

<span id="ii.LXXXIX-p38"></span>11. Lastly, what hast Thou done in the
sea itself, to pacify its rage, and to weaken it? “Thou hast humbled the
proud <span id="fr_4154"></span>[4155](#fn_4154.md) as one that is wounded”
([Psa. 89.10](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#010.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXIX-p39.1"></span>). There is a certain proud serpent in the
sea, of which another passage of Scripture speaks, “I will command the
serpent, and he shall bite him;” <span
id="fr_4155"></span>[4156](#fn_4155.md) and again, “There is that
Leviathan, whom Thou hast made to mock him,” <span
id="fr_4156"></span>[4157](#fn_4156.md) whose head He bruises above the
water. “Thou,” he says, “hast humbled the proud, as one that is
wounded.” Thou hast humbled Thyself, and the proud was humbled: for the
proud held the proud ones through pride: but the great One is humbled,
and by believing in Him become small. While the little one is nourished
by the example of One who from greatness descended to humility, the
devil has lost what he held: because the proud held only the proud. When
such an example of humility was displayed before them, men learned to
condemn their own pride, and to imitate the humility of God. Thus also
the devil, by losing those whom he had in his power, has even himself
been humbled; not chastened, but thrown prostrate. “Thou hast humbled
the proud like one that is wounded.” Thou hast been humbled, and hast
humbled others: Thou hast been wounded, and hast wounded others: for Thy
blood, as it was shed to blot the handwriting of sins,  <span
id="fr_4157"></span>[4158](#fn_4157.md) could not but wound him. For what
was the ground of his pride, except the bond which he held against us.
This bond, this handwriting, Thou hast blotted out with Thy blood: him
therefore hast Thou wounded, from whom Thou hast rescued so many
victims. You must understand the devil wounded, not by the piercing of
the flesh, which he has not, but by the bruising of his proud heart.
“Thou hast scattered Thine enemies abroad with Thy mighty arm.”

<span id="ii.LXXXIX-p43"></span>12. “The heavens are thine, the earth
also is Thine” ([Psa. 89.11](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#011.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXIX-p43.1"></span>). From Thee, over Thy earth they rain.
Thine are the heavens, by whom is preached Thy truth in circuit of Thee;
“Thine is the earth,” which has received Thy truth in circuit of Thee;
and what has resulted from that rain? “Thou hast laid the foundation of
the round world, and all that therein is.” “Thou hast created the north
and the seas” ([Psa. 89.12](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#012.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXIX-p43.2"></span>). For nothing has any power against Thee,
against its Creator. The world indeed may rage through its own malice,
and the perversity of its will; does it nevertheless pass over the bound
laid down by the Creator, who made all things? Why then do I fear the
north wind? Why do I fear the seas? In the north indeed is the devil,
who said, “I will sit in the sides of the north; I <span
id="page_433">p. 433</span> <span id="ii.LXXXIX-Page_433"></span>will be
like the Most High;” <span id="fr_4158"></span>[4159](#fn_4158.md) but Thou
hast humbled, as one wounded, the proud one. Thus what Thou hast done in
them has more force for Thy dominion, than their own will has for their
wickedness. “Thou hast created the north and the seas.”

<span id="ii.LXXXIX-p45"></span>13. “Thabor and Hermon shall rejoice in
Thy name.” Those mountains are here understood, but they have a meaning.
“Thabor and Hermon shall rejoice in Thy name.” Thabor, when interpreted,
signifies an approaching light. But whence comes the light of which it
is said, “Ye are the light of the world,” <span
id="fr_4159"></span>[4160](#fn_4159.md) unless from Him concerning whom it
is written, “That was the true light, which lighteth every man coming
into the world”? <span id="fr_4160"></span>[4161](#fn_4160.md) The light
then which is the light of the world comes from that light which is not
kindled from any other source, so that there is no fear lest it be
extinguished. The light then comes from Him, who is that candle which is
not set beneath the bushel, but on a candlestick, Thabor the coming
light. Hermon means his curse. Justly the light comes and is made the
curse of him. Of whom but the devil, the wounded one, the proud one? Our
illumination then is given from Thee; that he is held accursed of us,
who kept us in his own error and pride, is from Thee. “Thabor and
Hermon, therefore, shall rejoice,” not in their own merits, “but in Thy
name.” For they shall say, “Not unto us, Lord, not unto us, but to Thy
name give the praise,” on account of the raging sea: lest “the heathen
say, Where is now their God?” <span id="fr_4161"></span>[4162](#fn_4161.md)

<span id="ii.LXXXIX-p49"></span>14. “Thou hast a mighty arm” ([Psa.
89.13](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#013.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXIX-p49.1"></span>). Let no man arrogate anything to himself.
“Thou hast a mighty arm:” by Thee we were created, by Thee we have been
defended. “Thou hast a mighty arm: strong be Thy hand, and high be Thy
right hand.”

<span id="ii.LXXXIX-p50"></span>15. “Righteousness and judgment are the
preparation of Thy seat” ([Psa.
89.14](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#014.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXIX-p50.1"></span>). Thy righteousness and judgment will
appear in the end: they are now hidden. Of Thy righteousness it is
treated in another Psalm, <span id="fr_4162"></span>[4163](#fn_4162.md) “on
the hidden things of the Son.” There will then be a manifestation of Thy
righteousness and judgment: some will be set on the right, others on the
left hand: <span id="fr_4163"></span>[4164](#fn_4163.md) and the
unbelieving will tremble, when they see what now they mock at, and
believe not: the righteous will rejoice, when they shall see what they
now see not, yet believe. “Righteousness and judgment are the
preparation of Thy seat:” especially in the Day of Judgment. What then
now? “mercy and truth go before Thy face.” I should fear the preparation
of Thy seat, Thy justice, and Thy coming judgment, did not mercy and
truth go before Thee: why should I at the end fear Thy righteousness,
when with Thy mercy going before Thee Thou blottest out my sins, and by
showing forth Thy truth fulfillest Thy promises? “Mercy and truth go
before Thy face.” For “all the paths of the Lord are mercy and
truth.” <span id="fr_4164"></span>[4165](#fn_4164.md)

<span id="ii.LXXXIX-p54"></span>16. In all these things shall we not
rejoice? or shall we contain our joy? or shall words suffice for our
gladness? or shall the tongue be able to express our rejoicing? If
therefore no words suffice, “Blessed is the people, O Lord, that knoweth
glad shouting” ([Psa. 89.15](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#015.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXIX-p54.1"></span>). O blessed people! dost thou conceive
aright, dost thou understand, glad shouting? For except thou understand
glad shouting, thou canst not be blessed. What do I mean by
understanding glad shouting? Whether thou knowest the source of that
rejoicing which is beyond words to express. For this joy is not of
thyself, since “he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.” <span
id="fr_4165"></span>[4166](#fn_4165.md) Rejoice not then in thy own pride,
but in God’s grace. See that that grace is such, that the tongue fails
to express its greatness, and then thou understandest glad shouting.…O
Lord, “they shall walk in the light of Thy countenance.” “They shall
rejoice in Thy name all the day” ([Psa.
89.16](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#016.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXIX-p55.2"></span>). That Thabor and Hermon shall rejoice in
Thy name: all day shall they rejoice, if they will, in Thy name; but if
they will rejoice in their own name, they shall not rejoice all day: for
they shall not continue in their joy, when they shall delight in
themselves, and fall through pride. That they may rejoice all day,
therefore, “they shall rejoice in Thy name, and in Thy righteousness
shall they be exalted.” Not in their own, but in Thine: lest they have a
zeal of God, but not according to knowledge. For some are noted by the
Apostle, that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge,
“being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and going about to establish
their own,” and not rejoicing in Thy light, and thus “not submitting
themselves unto the righteousness of God.” <span
id="fr_4166"></span>[4167](#fn_4166.md) And why? because “they have a zeal
of God, but not according to knowledge.” But the people who knoweth glad
shouting (for the former err from want of knowledge, but blessed is the
people not that knoweth not, but that knoweth glad shouting), whence
ought it to shout, whence to rejoice, but in Thy name, walking in the
light of Thy countenance? And it shall deserve to be exalted, but in Thy
righteousness: let every man take away altogether his own righteousness,
and be trembled: the righteousness of God shall come, and he shall be
exalted, “and in Thy righteousness shall they be exalted.”

<span id="ii.LXXXIX-p57"></span>17. “For Thou art the glory of their
strength: and in Thy good pleasure Thou shalt lift up our horns” ([Psa.
89.17](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#017.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXIX-p57.1"></span>): because it has seemed good to Thee, not
because we are worthy.

<span id="ii.LXXXIX-p58"></span><span id="page_434">p. 434</span> <span
id="ii.LXXXIX-Page_434"></span>18. “For of the Lord is our taking up”
([Psa. 89.18](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#018.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXIX-p58.1"></span>). For I was moved like a heap of sand, that
I might fall; and I should have fallen, had not the Lord taken me up.
“For of the Lord is (our <span id="fr_4167"></span>[4168](#fn_4167) .md)
taking up: and of the Holy One of Israel our King.” Himself is thy
taking up, Himself thy illumination: in His light thou art safe, in His
light thou walkest, in His righteousness thou art exalted. He took thee
up, He guards thy weakness: He gives thee strength of Himself, not of
thyself.

<span id="ii.LXXXIX-p60"></span>19. “Thou spakest sometime in vision
unto Thy sons, and saidst” ([Psa.
89.19](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#019.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXIX-p60.1"></span>). Thou spakest in thy vision. Thou didst
reveal this to Thy Prophets. For this reason Thou spakest in vision,
that is, in revelation: whence Prophets were called seers. They saw
something within, which they were to speak without: and secretly they
heard what they preached openly. <span
id="fr_4168"></span>[4169](#fn_4168.md) Then “Thou spakest in vision unto
Thy sons, and saidst, I have laid help upon One that is mighty.” Ye
understand Who is meant by mighty? “I have exalted One chosen out of the
people.” And Who is meant by chosen? One who, ye rejoice, is already
exalted.

<span id="ii.LXXXIX-p62"></span>20. “I have found David My servant:”
that David from David’s seed: “with My holy oil have I anointed Him”
([Psa. 89.20](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#020.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXIX-p62.1"></span>): for it is said of Him, “God, even Thy
God, hath anointed Thee with the oil of gladness above Thy
fellows.” <span id="fr_4169"></span>[4170](#fn_4169.md)

<span id="ii.LXXXIX-p64"></span>21. “My hand shall hold Him fast, and My
arm shall strengthen Him” ([Psa.
89.21](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#021.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXIX-p64.1"></span>): because there was a taking up of man;
because flesh was assumed in the Virgin’s womb, <span
id="fr_4170"></span>[4171](#fn_4170.md) because by Him who in the form of
God is coequal with the Father, the form of a servant was taken, and He
became obedient unto death, even the death of the Cross. <span
id="fr_4171"></span>[4172](#fn_4171.md)

<span id="ii.LXXXIX-p67"></span>22. “The enemy shall not be able to do
him violence” ([Psa. 89.22](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#022.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXIX-p67.1"></span>). The enemy rages indeed but he shall not
be able to do Him violence: he is wont to hurt, but he shall not hurt.
How then shall he afflict Him? he will exercise Him, but he shall not
hurt Him. There shall be profit in his raging; for those against whom he
rages shall be crowned in their conquering. For how is he conquered, if
he rages not against us? or where is God our helper, if we fight not?
The enemy therefore shall do what is in his power; but “he shall not be
able to do Him violence: the son of wickedness shall not come nigh to
hurt Him.”

<span id="ii.LXXXIX-p68"></span>23. “I will cut in pieces His enemies
before His face” ([Psa. 89.23](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#023.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXIX-p68.1"></span>). They are cut in pieces from their
conspiracy, and in that they believe they are cut in pieces; for they
believe by degrees; as when the calf’s head was ground small, they will
come to be the drink of God’s people. For Moses ground down the calf’s
head, and sprinkled it upon the water, and made the children of Israel
drink it. <span id="fr_4172"></span>[4173](#fn_4172.md) All the unbelieving
are ground: they believe by degrees; and they are drunk by the people of
God, and pass into Christ’s body. “I will cut in pieces His foes before
His face: and put to flight them that hate Him.”

<span id="ii.LXXXIX-p70"></span>24. “My truth also and My mercy is with
Him” ([Psa. 89.24](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#024.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXIX-p70.1"></span>). All the paths of the Lord are mercy and
truth. Remember, as much as ye can, how often these two attributes are
urged upon us, that we render them back to God. For as He showed us
mercy that He might blot out our sins, and truth in fulfilling His
promises; so also we, walking in His path, ought to give back to Him
mercy and truth; mercy, in pitying the wretched; truth, in not judging
unjustly. Let not truth rob you of mercy, nor mercy hinder truth: for if
through mercy you shall have judged contrary to truth, or by rigorous
truth shall have forgotten mercy, you will not be walking in the path of
God, where “mercy and truth meet together.” <span
id="fr_4173"></span>[4174](#fn_4173.md) “And in My name shall His horn be
exalted.” Why should I say more? Ye are Christians, recognise Christ.

<span id="ii.LXXXIX-p72"></span>25. “I will set His hand also in the
sea” ([Psa. 89.25](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#025.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXIX-p72.1"></span>): that is, He shall rule over the Gentiles;
“and His right hand in the floods.” Rivers run into the sea: avaricious
men roll onwards into the bitterness of this world: yet all these kinds
of men will be subject to Christ.

<span id="ii.LXXXIX-p73"></span>26. “He shall call me, Thou art My
Father, and the lifter up of My salvation” ([Psa.
89.26](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#026.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXIX-p73.1"></span>).

<span id="ii.LXXXIX-p74"></span>“And I will make Him my first-born;
higher than the kings of the earth” ([Psa.
89.27](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#027.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXIX-p74.1"></span>). Our Martyrs, whose birthdays we are
celebrating, shed their blood on account of these things, which were
believed though not yet seen; how much more brave ought we to be, as we
see what they believed? For they had not yet seen Christ raised on high
among the kings of the earth: as yet princes were taking counsel
together against the Lord and His Anointed: what follows in the same
Psalm was not then fulfilled, “Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be
learned, ye that are judges of the earth.” <span
id="fr_4174"></span>[4175](#fn_4174.md) Now indeed Christ has been exalted
among the kings of the earth.

<span id="ii.LXXXIX-p76"></span>27. “My mercy will I keep for Him for
ever: and my Testament faithful with Him” ([Psa.
89.28](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#028.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXIX-p76.1"></span>). On His account, the Testament is
faithful: in Him the Testament is mediated: He is the Sealer, the
Mediator of the Testament, the Surety of the Testament, the Witness of
the Testament, the Heritage of the Testament, the Coheir of the
Testament.

<span id="ii.LXXXIX-p77"></span>28. “His seed will I make to endure
world without end” ([Psa. 89.29](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#029.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXIX-p77.1"></span>). Not only for this <span id="page_435">p.
435</span> <span id="ii.LXXXIX-Page_435"></span>world, but unto the
world without end: <span id="fr_4175"></span>[4176](#fn_4175.md) whither
His seed, which is His heritage, the seed of Abraham, which is Christ,
will pass. <span id="fr_4176"></span>[4177](#fn_4176.md) But if ye are
Christ’s, ye are also Abraham’s seed: and if ye are destined His heirs
for ever, “He will establish His seed unto world without end: and His
throne as the days of Heaven.” The thrones of earthly kings are as the
days of the earth: different are the days of Heaven from those of earth.
The days of Heaven are those years of which it is said, “Thou art the
same, and Thy years shall not fail.” <span
id="fr_4177"></span>[4178](#fn_4177.md) The days of the earth are soon
overtaken by their successors: those which precede are shut out from us:
nor do those which succeed remain: but they come that they may go, and
are almost gone before they are come. Such are the days of earth. But
the days of Heaven, which are also the “One day” of Heaven, <span
id="fr_4178"></span>[4179](#fn_4178.md) and the never failing years, have
neither beginning nor end: nor is any day there narrowed between
yesterday and to-morrow: no one there expects the future, nor loses the
past: but the days of Heaven are always present, where His throne shall
be for ever and ever. <span id="fr_4179"></span>[4180](#fn_4179.md) …

<span id="ii.LXXXIX-p83"></span>29. This is a strong pledge of the
promise of God. The sons of this David are the children of the
Bridegroom; all Christians therefore are called His sons. But it is much
indeed that God promises, that if Christians, that is, “If his children
forsake My law, and walk not in My judgments” ([Psa.
89.30](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#030.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXIX-p83.1"></span>); “if they profane My statutes, and keep
not My commandments” ([Psa. 89.31](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#031.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXIX-p83.2"></span>); I will not spurn them, nor will I send
them away from Me in perdition: but what will I do? “I will visit their
offences with the rod, and their sin with scourges” ([Psa.
89.32](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#032.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXIX-p83.3"></span>). It is not the mercy of one that calls
them only; but also that chastises and scourges them. Let therefore thy
Father’s hand be upon thee, and if thou art a good son, repel not
chastening; for “what son is there, to whom his father giveth not
chastening?” <span id="fr_4180"></span>[4181](#fn_4180.md) Let Him chasten
him, so long as He takes not from him His mercy: let Him beat him when
obstinate, as long as He does not disinherit him. If thou hast well
understood the promises of thy Father, fear not to be scourged, but to
be disinherited: “for whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth: and scourgeth
every son whom He receiveth.” <span id="fr_4181"></span>[4182](#fn_4181.md)
Does the sinful son spurn chastening, when he sees the only Son without
sin scourged? “I will visit their offences with the rod.” Thus too the
Apostle threatens: “What will ye? shall I come unto you with a
rod?” <span id="fr_4182"></span>[4183](#fn_4182.md) Let not pious sons say,
if Thou art coming with a rod, come not at all. For it is better to be
taught with the Father’s rod, than to perish in the caresses of the
robber.

<span id="ii.LXXXIX-p87"></span>30. “Nevertheless, My mercy will I not
utterly take from Him” ([Psa.
89.33](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#033.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXIX-p87.1"></span>). From whom? From that David to whom I gave
these promises, whom “I anointed with my holy oil of gladness above His
fellows.” <span id="fr_4183"></span>[4184](#fn_4183.md) Do you recognise
Him from whom God will not utterly take away His mercy? That no one may
anxiously say, since He speaks of Christ as Him from whom He will not
take away His mercy, What then will become of the sinner? Did He say
anything like this, “I will not take My loving-kindness utterly from
them”? “I will visit,” He saith, “their offences with the rod, and their
sin with scourges.” Thou didst expect for thy own security, “I will not
utterly take my loving-kindness from” them. And indeed this is the
reading of some books, but not of the most accurate: though, where they
have it, it is a reading by no means inconsistent with the real meaning.
For how can it be said that He will not utterly take His mercy from
Christ? Has the Saviour of the body committed aught of sin either in
Heaven or in earth, “who sitteth even at the right hand of God, who also
maketh intercession for us”? <span id="fr_4184"></span>[4185](#fn_4184.md)
Yet it is from Christ: but from His members, His body which is the
Church. For in this sense He speaks of it as a great thing that He will
not take away His mercies from Him, supposing us not to recognise the
only Son, who is in the bosom of the Father; <span
id="fr_4185"></span>[4186](#fn_4185.md) for there the Man is not counted
for His Person, but the One Person is God and Man. He therefore does not
utterly take His mercies from Him, when He takes not His mercy from His
body, His members, <span id="fr_4186"></span>[4187](#fn_4186.md) in which,
even while He was enthroned in Heaven, He was still suffering
persecutions on earth; and when He cried from Heaven, “Saul, Saul,” not
why persecutest thou My servants, nor why persecutest thou My saints,
nor My disciples, but, “why persecutest thou Me?” <span
id="fr_4187"></span>[4188](#fn_4187.md) As then, while no one persecuted
Him when sitting in Heaven, He cried out, “Why persecutest thou Me?”
when the Head recognised its limbs, and His love allowed not the Head to
separate Himself from the union of the body: so, when He taketh not away
His mercies from Him, it is surely that He taketh it not from us, who
are His limbs and body. Yet ought we not on that account to sin not
without apprehension, and perversely to assure ourselves that we shall
not <span id="page_436">p. 436</span> <span
id="ii.LXXXIX-Page_436"></span>perish, be our actions what they may. For
there are certain sins and certain offences, to define and discourse of
which it is either impossible for me, or if it were possible, it would
be too tedious for the time we have at present. For no man can say that
he is without sin; for if he says so, he will lie; “if we say that we
have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.” <span
id="fr_4188"></span>[4189](#fn_4188.md) Each one therefore is needfully
scourged for his own sins; but the mercy of God is not taken away from
him, if he be a Christian. Certainly if thou committest such offences as
to repel the hand of Him who chasteneth, the rod of Him who scourgeth
thee, and art angry at the correction of God, and fliest from thy Father
when He chasteneth thee, and wilt not suffer Him to be thy Father,
because He spares thee not when thou dost sin; thou hast estranged
thyself from thy heritage, He has not thrown thee off; for if thou
wouldest abide being scourged, thou wouldest not abide disinherited.
“Nor will I do hurt in My truth.” For His mercy in setting free shall
not be taken away, lest His truth in taking vengeance do harm.

<span id="ii.LXXXIX-p94"></span>31. “My covenant will I not profane, nor
reject the thing that is gone out of my lips” ([Psa.
89.34](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#034.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXIX-p94.1"></span>). Because his sons sin, I will not on this
account be found false: I have promised; I will do. Suppose they choose
to sin even as past hope, and so fall into sins as to offend their
Father’s countenance, and deserve to be disinherited; is it not still
God Himself, of whom it is said, “From these stones” He “will raise up
sons to Abraham”? <span id="fr_4189"></span>[4190](#fn_4189.md) Therefore I
tell you, brethren, many Christians sin venially, <span
id="fr_4190"></span>[4191](#fn_4190.md) many are scourged and so corrected
for their sin, chastened, and cured; many turn away altogether, striving
with a stiff neck against the discipline of the Father, even wholly
refusing God as their Father, though they have the mark of Christ, and
so fall into such sins, that it can only be announced against them,
“that they who do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of
God.” <span id="fr_4191"></span>[4192](#fn_4191.md) Nevertheless, Christ
shall not be destitute of an inheritance on their account: not for the
chaff’s sake shall the wheat also perish: <span
id="fr_4192"></span>[4193](#fn_4192.md) nor on account of bad fish shall
nothing be cast into the vessels from that net. <span
id="fr_4193"></span>[4194](#fn_4193.md) “The Lord knows them that are
His.” <span id="fr_4194"></span>[4195](#fn_4194.md) For He who predestined
us before we were born, promised undoubtingly: “For whom He did
predestinate, them He also called: and whom He called, them He also
justified: and whom He justified, them He also glorified.” <span
id="fr_4195"></span>[4196](#fn_4195.md) Let desperate sinners sin as far as
they choose: let the members of Christ reply, “If God is with us, who
shall be against us?” God will not therefore do hurt in His truth, nor
will He “profane His Testament.” His Testament remains immovable,
because in His foreknowledge He predestined His heirs; and “He will not
reject the thing that is gone out of His lips.”

<span id="ii.LXXXIX-p102"></span>32. Listen for thy confirmation in
hope, for thy security, if thou knowest thyself to be among the members
of Christ. “I have sworn once by My holiness that I will not lie unto
David” ([Psa. 89.35](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#035.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXIX-p102.1"></span>). Dost thou wait till God swear a second
time? How often is He to swear, if in one oath He is false? One oath He
made for our life, who sent His Only One to die for us. “I have sworn
once by My holiness, that I will not lie unto David.” “His seed shall
endure for ever” ([Psa. 89.36](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#036.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXIX-p102.2"></span>). His seed endures for ever; because the
Lord knows them that are His. “And His seat is like as the sun before
me:” “and as the moon perfect for evermore: and the faithful witness in
heaven” ([Psa. 89.37](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#037.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXIX-p102.3"></span>). They are His seat, in whom He sits and
reigns. But if His seat, His members also; because even our members are
the seat of our head. See how all our other members sustain our head:
but the head supports nothing above itself, but is itself supported by
the rest of our limbs, as if the whole body of a man were the seat of
his head. His seat, therefore, all in whom God reigns, “shall be like as
the sun before Me,” He saith: because the righteous in the kingdom of My
Father “shall shine like the sun.” <span
id="fr_4196"></span>[4197](#fn_4196.md) But the sun is meant in a
spiritual, not a bodily sense, as that which shines from Heaven, which
He maketh to rise upon the just and unjust. <span
id="fr_4197"></span>[4198](#fn_4197.md) Finally, that sun is not before
men’s eyes only, but even those of cattle and the smallest insects; for
which of the vilest animals sees not that sun? What does he say to
distinguish the sun meant here? “Like as the sun before Me.” Not before
men, before the flesh, before mortal animals, but “before Me, and as the
moon.” But what moon? one “that is perfect for evermore.” For although
that moon which we know becomes perfect, the next day she begins to
wane, after her orb is full. “He shall be as the moon perfect for
evermore,” He saith. His seat shall be made perfect as the moon, but
that moon is one which will be perfect for evermore. If as the sun, why
also as the moon? the Scriptures usually signify by the moon the
mortality of this flesh, because of its increasings and decreasings,
because of its transitory nature. The moon is also interpreted as
Jericho: one who was descending from Jerusalem to Jericho fell among
robbers:  <span id="fr_4198"></span>[4199](#fn_4198.md) for he was
descending from immortality to mortality. Similar then is the flesh to
<span id="page_437">p. 437</span> <span
id="ii.LXXXIX-Page_437"></span>that moon, which every month suffers
increase and decrease: but that flesh of ours will be perfect in the
resurrection: “and a faithful witness in heaven.” Thus then, if it was
our mind only that would be perfected, he would compare us only to the
sun: if our body only, to the moon; but as God will perfect us in both,
in respect of the mind it is said, “like as the sun before Me,” because
God only seeth the mind: and “as the moon,” so is the flesh: which
“shall be made perfect for evermore,” in the resurrection of the dead:
“and a faithful witness in Heaven,” because all that was asserted of the
resurrection of the dead was true. I beseech you, hear this again more
clearly, and remember it: for I know that some understand, while others
are yet enquiring perhaps what I meant. There is no article of the
Christian faith which has encountered such contradiction as that of the
resurrection of the flesh. Finally, He who was born for a sign that
should be spoken against, <span id="fr_4199"></span>[4200](#fn_4199.md)
resumed His own flesh after death to meet the caviller; and He who could
have so completely cured His wounds that their scars would have entirely
vanished, retained those scars in His body, that He might cure the
wounds of doubt in the heart. Indeed nothing has been attacked with the
same pertinacious, contentious contradiction, in the Christian faith, as
the resurrection of the flesh. On the immortality of the soul many
Gentile philosophers have disputed at great length, and in many books
they have left it written that the soul is immortal: when they come to
the resurrection of the flesh, they doubt not indeed, but they most
openly deny it, declaring it to be absolutely impossible that this
earthly flesh can ascend to Heaven. Thus that moon shall be perfect for
evermore, and shall be the faithful witness in heaven against all
gain-sayers.

<span id="ii.LXXXIX-p107"></span>33. These promises, so sure, so firm,
so open, so unquestioned, were made concerning Christ. For although some
are mysteriously veiled, yet some are so clear, that all that is obscure
is easily revealed by them. Such being the case, see what follows: “But
Thou hast approved and brought to nothing and forsaken Thine Anointed”
([Psa. 89.38](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#038.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXIX-p107.1"></span>). “Thou hast overthrown the testament of
Thy servant, and profaned His holiness on the ground” ([Psa.
89.39](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#039.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXIX-p107.2"></span>). “Thou hast broken down all His hedges,
and made His strongholds a terror” ([Psa.
89.40](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#040.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXIX-p107.3"></span>).…How is this? Thou hast promised all
those things: and Thou hast brought to pass their reverse. Where are now
the promises which but a little before filled us with delight? which we
so joyfully applauded, which we so fearlessly made our boast of? It is
as if one promised, and another destroyed. And this is the mystery: for
the words are not “another,” but “Thou,” Thou who didst promise, who
didst even swear in condescension to human doubt, Thou hast promised
this, and done thus! Whence shall I get Thy oath, where shall I find Thy
promise fulfilled? Would then God promise, or swear thus falsely? and
yet why then these promises, and these acts? I answer, that He acted
thus in fulfilment of those promises. But who am I, to say this? Let us
see therefore whether it is the language of the Truth; what I say will
not then be without foundation. It was David to whom the fulfilment of
these promises in his seed, that is, in Christ, was promised: and as
they were addressed to David, men expected their completion in David.
Further, lest when any Christian asserted these promises to have
referred to Christ, another by applying them to David, because he
described the fulfilment of all of them in David, might thus err; He
cancelled them in David, thus obliging us when we see them unfulfilled
in David, to look to another quarter for their fulfilment. Thus also in
the case of Esau and Jacob, we find the elder worshipped by the younger,
though it is written, “The elder shall serve the younger;” <span
id="fr_4200"></span>[4201](#fn_4200.md) so when you see it unfulfilled in
those two brothers, you look for two peoples in whom to discover the
completion of what God in His truth deigns to promise. “From the fruit
of thy body,” saith the Lord unto David, “shall I set upon thy
sea.” <span id="fr_4201"></span>[4202](#fn_4201.md) He promised from his
seed something for evermore: and, Solomon, born to him, became master of
such wisdom, <span id="fr_4202"></span>[4203](#fn_4202.md) that the promise
of God respecting the fruit of David’s body was believed to have been
fulfilled in him; but Solomon fell, <span
id="fr_4203"></span>[4204](#fn_4203.md) and gave room for hoping for
Christ; that since God can neither be deceived nor deceive, He might not
make His promise to rest in one who He knew would fall, but you might
after the fall of Solomon look back to God, and demand His promise. Hast
Thou, O Lord, deceived? Hast Thou failed to fulfil Thy promise? Dost
Thou not exhibit what Thou hast sworn? Perhaps God might reply, I swore
and promised: but Solomon would not persevere. What then? Didst not
Thou, Lord God, know beforehand that he would not persevere? Indeed Thou
didst know. Why then didst Thou promise me what should be eternal in one
who would not persevere? Hast Thou not answered; “But if his children
forsake My law, and walk not in My judgments; if they keep not My
statutes, and profane My testament;” yet My promise shall remain, and My
oath shall be fulfilled: “I have sworn once in My Holiness,” within, in
a certain mystery, in the very spring whence the Prophets <span
id="page_438">p. 438</span> <span id="ii.LXXXIX-Page_438"></span>drank,
whence they burst forth to us of these things, “I have sworn once” that
I will not fail David. Show forth then what Thou hast sworn, give us
what Thou hast promised. The fulfilment is taken from that David, that
it might not be looked for in that David: wait therefore for what I have
promised.

<span id="ii.LXXXIX-p112"></span>34. Even David himself knew this.
Consider his words; “Thou hast rejected and brought him down to
nothing.” Where then is Thy promise? “Thou hast put off Thine anointed.”
This expression cheers us, among much that is sorrowful: for the promise
of God is still valid; for <span id="fr_4204"></span>[4205](#fn_4204.md)
Thou hast put off Thine Anointed, not taken Him away. See then what was
the fate of that David, in whom the ignorant hoped for the fulfilment of
the promises of God, in order that those promises might be more firmly
relied upon for their fulfilment in another. “Thou hast put off Thine
Anointed: Thou hast overthrown the testament of Thy servant.” For where
is the Old Testament of the Jews? where that land of promise, in which
they sinned while they dwelt in it, on the overthrow of which they
wandered afar? Ask you for the kingdom of the Jews; it exists not: you
ask for the altar of the Jews; it is not: you ask for the sacrifice of
the Jews; it is not: you ask for the priesthood of the Jews; it is not.
“Thou hast overthrown the testament of Thy servant, and profaned his
holiness on the earth.” Thou hast shown that what they thought holy, was
earthly. “Thou hast broken down all his hedges,” with which Thou hast
entrenched him: for how could he have been spoiled unless his hedges had
been broken down? “Thou hast made his strongholds a terror.” Why terror?
That it should be said to the sinners, “For if God spared not the
natural branches, take heed lest He also spare not thee.” <span
id="fr_4205"></span>[4206](#fn_4205.md)

<span id="ii.LXXXIX-p115"></span>“All they that go by the way have
spoiled him:” that is, all the heathen that go by the way, meaning, all
who pass through this life, have spoiled Israel, have spoiled David.
First of all, see his fragments in all nations: for it is of the Jews
that it is said, “They shall be a portion for foxes.” <span
id="fr_4206"></span>[4207](#fn_4206.md) For the Scripture calls wicked,
crafty, and cowardly kings, whom another’s virtue terrifies, foxes. Thus
when our Lord Himself was speaking of the threatening Herod, He said,
“Go ye, and tell that fox.” <span id="fr_4207"></span>[4208](#fn_4207.md)
The king who fears no man, is not a fox: like that Lion of Judah, of
whom it is said, “Stooping down Thou didst rise up, and didst sleep as a
lion.” <span id="fr_4208"></span>[4209](#fn_4208.md) At Thy will Thou didst
stoop down, at Thy will didst rise; because Thou wouldest, Thou didst
sleep. And thus in another Psalm he says, “I <span
id="fr_4209"></span>[4210](#fn_4209.md) slept.” <span
id="fr_4210"></span>[4211](#fn_4210.md) Was not the sentence complete, “I
slept, and took rest, and rose up again, because the Lord shall uphold
Me”? Why is the word ego added? and thus with a strong emphasis on the
word I, they raged against Me, they troubled Me: but had I not willed, I
had not slept. Those then concerning whom it was declared that they
should be a portion for foxes, are now spoken of as follows; “All they
that go by have spoiled him: and he is become a reproach to his
neighbours” ([Psa. 89.41](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#041.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXIX-p120.2"></span>). “Thou hast set up the right hand of his
enemies, and made all his adversaries to rejoice” ([Psa.
89.42](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#042.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXIX-p120.3"></span>). Look at the Jews, and see all things
fulfilled that were predicted. “Thou hast turned away the help of his
sword.” How they were used to fight few in number, and to strike down
many. “Thou hast turned away the help of his sword, and Thou givest him
not victory in the battle” ([Psa.
89.43](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#043.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXIX-p120.4"></span>). Naturally <span
id="fr_4211"></span>[4212](#fn_4211.md) then is he conquered, naturally
taken prisoner, naturally made an outcast from his kingdom, naturally
scattered abroad: for he lost that land, for which he slew the Lord.
“Thou hast loosed him from cleansing” ([Psa.
89.44](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#044.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXIX-p121.1"></span>). What is this? Amongst all the evils,
this is a matter for great fear; for howsoever God may beat, howsoever
He may be wroth, howsoever He may flog and scourge, yet let Him scourge
him bound, whom He is to cleanse, not “loose him from cleansing.” For if
He loose him from being purified, he becomes incapable of cleansing, and
must be an outcast. From what cleansing then is the Jew loosed? From
faith; for by faith we live:  <span id="fr_4212"></span>[4213](#fn_4212.md)
and it is said of faith, “purifying their hearts by faith:” <span
id="fr_4213"></span>[4214](#fn_4213.md) and as it is only the faith of
Christ that cleanses; by disbelief in Christ, they are loosed from
purification. “Thou hast loosed him from cleansing, and cast his throne
down to the ground.” And so Thou hast broken it. “The days of his seat
hast Thou shortened” ([Psa. 89.45](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#045.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXIX-p123.2"></span>). They imagined that they should reign for
ever. “And covered him with confusion.” All these things happened to the
Jews, Christ yet not being taken away, but His advent deferred.

<span id="ii.LXXXIX-p124"></span>35. Let us therefore see whether God
fulfils His promises. After these stern penalties which have been
recorded as having been inflicted upon this people and kingdom, that God
might not be supposed to have fulfilled His promises in it, and so not
to grant another kingdom in Christ, of which kingdom there shall be no
end; the Prophet addresses Him in these words, “Lord, how long wilt Thou
hide Thyself unto the end?” ([Psa.
89.46](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#046.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXIX-p124.1"></span>). For possibly it was not from them and to
the end; because “blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the
fulness of the Gentiles be come in, and so all Israel shall <span
id="page_439">p. 439</span> <span id="ii.LXXXIX-Page_439"></span>be
saved.” <span id="fr_4214"></span>[4215](#fn_4214.md) But in the mean while
“shall Thy wrath burn like fire.”

<span id="ii.LXXXIX-p126"></span>36. “O remember what my substance is”
([Psa. 89.47](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#047.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXIX-p126.1"></span>). That David, who was placed among the
Jews in the flesh, in Christ in hope, speaks “Remember what is my
substance.” For not because the Jews fell away, did my substance fail:
for from that people came the Virgin Mary, and from her the flesh of
Christ; that Flesh sins not, but purifies sins; there, saith David, is
my substance. “O remember what my substance is.” For the root has not
entirely perished; the seed shall come to whom the promise was made,
ordained by Angels in the hand of a Mediator. <span
id="fr_4215"></span>[4216](#fn_4215.md) “For Thou hast not made all the
sons of men for nought” ([Psa.
89.47](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#047.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXIX-p127.2"></span>). Lo! all the sons of men have gone into
vanity: yet Thou hast not made them for nought. If then all went into
vanity, whom Thou hast not made for nought; hast Thou not reserved some
instrument to purify them from vanity? This which Thou hast reserved to
Thyself to cleanse men from vanity is Thy Holy One, in Him is my
substance: for from Him are all, whom Thou hast not made for nought,
purified from their own vanity. To them it is said, “O ye sons of men,
how long are ye heavy in heart? Wherefore have ye such pleasure in
vanity, and seek after leasing?” <span
id="fr_4216"></span>[4217](#fn_4216.md) Perhaps they might become anxious,
and turn from their vanity, and when they found themselves polluted with
it, might seek for purification from it: then help them, make them
secure. “Know this also, that the Lord hath made wonderful His Holy
One.” <span id="fr_4217"></span>[4218](#fn_4217.md) He has made His Holy
One to be admired: thence He has purified all from their vanity: there,
saith David, is my substance: O remember it! “For Thou hast not made all
the sons of men for nought.” Thou hast therefore reserved something to
purify them: and who is He whom Thou hast reserved? “What man is he that
liveth, and shall not see death?” This man then who shall live and not
see death, shall purify them from nothingness. For He made not all men
for nought, nor can He who made them so despise His own creatures, as
not to convert and purify them.

<span id="ii.LXXXIX-p130"></span>37. “What man is he that shall live,
and shall not see death?” ([Psa.
89.48](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#048.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXIX-p130.1"></span>). For being raised from the dead He dieth
no more, and death hath no more dominion over Him. <span
id="fr_4218"></span>[4219](#fn_4218.md) And as in another Psalm it is said,
“Thou shalt not leave my soul in Hell, neither shalt Thou suffer Thy
Holy One to see corruption,” <span id="fr_4219"></span>[4220](#fn_4219.md)
the Apostolic teaching takes up this testimony, and in the Acts of the
Apostles <span id="fr_4220"></span>[4221](#fn_4220.md) thus argues against
the unbelieving; Men and brethren, we know that the patriarch David is
dead and buried, and his flesh hath seen corruption. Therefore it cannot
be said of him, “neither shalt Thou suffer Thy Holy One to see
corruption.” Of whom then is it said? “What man is he that shall live,
and shall not see death?” Perhaps there is no man such. Nay, but “who is
it?” is said to make thee inquire, not despair. But perhaps there may be
some man “that shall live, and shall not see death,” and yet perhaps he
did not speak of Christ, who died? There is no man “that shall live, and
shall not see death,” except Him who died for mortals. That thou mayest
be assured that it is said of Him, consider the sequel; “What man is he
that liveth, and shall not see death?” Did He never die then? He did.
How then shall He live, and never see death? “He shall deliver His own
soul from the hands of Hell.” He is spoken of alone indeed, in that He
alone of all others “shall live, and shall not see death: He shall
deliver His own soul from the hand of Hell,” because although the rest
of His faithful shall rise from the dead, and shall themselves live for
evermore, without seeing death; yet they shall not themselves deliver
their own souls from the hands of Hell. He who delivers His own soul
from the hands of Hell, Himself delivers those of His believers: they
cannot do so of themselves. Prove that He delivers His own soul. “I have
power to lay down My life, and I have power to take it again. No man
taketh ‘it from Me;’ for I Myself slept, but I lay it down of Myself,
and take it again,” <span id="fr_4221"></span>[4222](#fn_4221.md) because
it is He Himself who delivers His own soul from the hands of Hell.

<span id="ii.LXXXIX-p135"></span>38. But in the very faith in Christ
great difficulties occurred, and the heathen in their rage long said,
“When shall he die, and his name perish?” On account of these then who
have now long believed in Christ, but were destined to doubt for some
time, these words follow, “Lord, where are Thy old loving-kindnesses?”
([Psa. 89.49](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#049.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXIX-p135.1"></span>). We have now acknowledged Christ our
purifier, we now possess Him in whom Thy promises were to be fulfilled;
show forth in Him what Thou hast promised. It is He Himself that shall
live, and not see death: Himself who delivers His own soul from the hand
of Hell: and yet we are still in suffering. Thus spoke the Martyrs,
whose birthdays we are celebrating. He shall live, and not see death: He
delivers His soul from the hands of Hell: yet “for Thy sake we are
killed all the day long: and are counted as sheep appointed to be
slain.” <span id="fr_4222"></span>[4223](#fn_4222.md) “Lord, where are Thy
old loving-kindnesses which Thou swarest unto David in Thy truth?”

<span id="ii.LXXXIX-p137"></span>39. “Remember, Lord, the rebuke that
Thy servants have” ([Psa. 89.50](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#050.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXIX-p137.1"></span>). Even while Christ was living, and while
He was sitting on His <span id="page_440">p. 440</span> <span
id="ii.LXXXIX-Page_440"></span>Father’s right hand, reproaches were cast
against the Christians: they long were reproached with the name of
Christ. That widowed one who brought forth, and whose children were more
than those of the married wife, <span
id="fr_4223"></span>[4224](#fn_4223.md) heard ill names, heard reproaches:
but the Church, multiplied as she is, extending right and left, no
longer remembers the reproach of her widowhood. “Remember, Lord,” in the
memory of whom there is abundant sweetness. “Remember,” forget not.
Remember what? “the rebuke that Thy servants have: and how I do bear in
my bosom the rebukes of many people.” I went, saith he, to preach of
Thee, and I heard reproaches, and bore them in my bosom, because I was
fulfilling the prophecy. “Being defamed we entreat: we are made as the
filth of the earth, and are the offscouring of all things unto this
day.” <span id="fr_4224"></span>[4225](#fn_4224.md) Long the Christians
bore reproaches in their bosom, in their heart: nor dared resist their
revilers; before, when it was a crime to answer a heathen: it is now a
crime to remain a heathen. Thanks be to the Lord! He remembered our
rebukes: He raised the horn of His Anointed on high, He made Him the
Wonderful among the kings of the earth. Now no one insults Christians,
or if he does, it is not in public: he speaks as if he were still more
fearful of being heard, than anxious to be believed. “I bear in my bosom
the rebukes of many people.”

<span id="ii.LXXXIX-p140"></span>40. “Wherewith Thine enemies have
blasphemed Thee, O Lord” ([Psa.
89.51](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#051.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXIX-p140.1"></span>), both Jews and Pagans. “Wherewith they
have blasphemed.” Wherewith have they blasphemed Thee? “With the change
of Thine Anointed.” <span id="fr_4225"></span>[4226](#fn_4225.md) They
objected that Christ died, and was crucified. Madmen, what is your
reproach? Although there is now no one to use it: yet supposing some
still remaining that so speak, what is your reproach? that Christ died?
He was not destroyed, but changed. He is styled “dead” on account of the
three days. Wherewith then have thine enemies blasphemed Thee? Not with
the loss, not with the perdition of Thine Anointed, but with His
“change.” He was changed from temporal to eternal life: He was changed
from the Jews to the Gentiles; He was changed from earth to heaven. Let
then Thy vain enemies blaspheme Thee still for the change of Thine
Anointed. Would that they may be changed: they will not in that case
blaspheme the change of Christ, which displeases them since they
themselves will not be changed. “For there is no change with them, and
they fear not God.” <span id="fr_4226"></span>[4227](#fn_4226.md)

<span id="ii.LXXXIX-p143"></span>41. They have blasphemed the change of
Christ; but what dost thou answer? “The blessing of <span
id="fr_4227"></span>[4228](#fn_4227.md) the Lord for evermore. Amen and
Amen” ([Psa. 89.52](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#052.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXIX-p144.2"></span>). Thanks to His mercy, <span
id="fr_4228"></span>[4229](#fn_4228.md) thanks to His grace. We express our
thanks: we do not give them, nor return them, nor repay them: we express
our thanks in words, while in fact we retain our sense of them. <span
id="fr_4229"></span>[4230](#fn_4229.md) He saved us for no reward, He
heeded not our impieties: He searched us out when we searched not for
Him, He found, redeemed, emancipated us from the bondage of the devil
and the power of his wicked angels: He drew us to Him to purify us by
that faith, from which He releases those enemies only who believe not,
and who for that reason cannot be purified. Let those who still remain
infidels say every day what they choose; day by day they shall be fewer
and fewer that remain; let them revile, mock, accuse, not the death, but
the change of Christ. Do they not see that, when they say these things,
they fail in purpose either by believing or by dying? For their curse is
temporal: but the blessing of the Lord “for evermore.” To confirm that
blessing is added, “Amen and Amen.” This is the signature of the bond of
God. Secure then of His promises, let us believe the past, recognise the
present, hope for the future. Let not the enemy lead us astray from the
way, that He, who gathers us like chickens under His wings, may foster
us: lest we stray from His wings, and the hawk of the air carry us off
while yet unfledged. For the Christian ought not to hope in himself: if
he hopes to be strong, let him be reared by his mother’s warmth. This is
the hen who gathers her young together; whence is the reproach of our
Saviour against the unbelieving Jerusalem. “Behold, your house shall be
left unto you desolate.”  <span id="fr_4230"></span>[4231](#fn_4230.md)
Hence was it said, “Thou hast made his strongholds a terror.” Since then
they would not be gathered together under the wings of this hen, and
have given as a warning to teach us to dread the unclean spirits that
fly in the air, seeking daily what they may devour; let us gather
ourselves under the wings of this hen, the divine Wisdom, since she is
weakened even unto death of her chickens. Let us love our Lord God, let
us love His Church: Him as a Father, Her as a Mother: Him as a Lord, Her
as His Handmaid, as we are ourselves the Handmaid’s sons. But this
marriage is held together by a bond of great love: no man offends the
one, and wins favour of the other. Let no man say, “I go indeed to the
idols, I consult possessed ones and fortune-tellers: yet I abandon not
God’s Church; I am a Catholic.” While thou holdest to thy Mother, thou
hast offended thy Father. Another says, Far be it from me; I consult no
sorcerer, I seek out no possessed one, I never ask advice <span
id="page_441">p. 441</span> <span id="ii.LXXXIX-Page_441"></span>by
sacrilegious divination, I go not to worship idols, I bow not before
stones; though I am in the party of Donatus. What does it profit you not
to have offended your Father, if he avenges your offended Mother? what
does it serve you, if you acknowledge the Lord, honour God, preach His
name, acknowledge His Son, confess that He sitteth by His right hand;
while you blaspheme His Church? Does not the analogy of human marriages
convince you? Suppose you have some patron, whom you court every day,
whose threshold you wear with your visits, whom you daily not only
salute, but even worship, to whom you pay the most loyal courtesy; if
you utter one calumny against his wife, could you re-enter his house?
Hold then, most beloved, hold all with one mind to God the Father, and
the Church our Mother. Celebrate with temperance the birthdays of the
Saints, that we may imitate those who have gone before us, and that they
who pray for you may rejoice over you; that “the blessing of the Lord
may abide on you for evermore. Amen and Amen.”
