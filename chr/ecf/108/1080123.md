<span id="ii.CXII-p1"></span> <span id="ii.CXII-p1.1"></span><span
class="c20"><span id="ii.CXII-p1.2"></span>Psalm CXII. <span
id="fr_5005"></span>[5006](#fn_5005.md) </span>

<span id="ii.CXII-p3"></span>1. I believe, brethren, that ye remarked
and committed to memory the title of this Psalm. “The conversion,” he
saith, “of Haggai and Zechariah.” These prophets were not as yet in
existence, when these verses were sung. <span
id="fr_5006"></span>[5007](#fn_5006.md) …<span id="page_547">p. 547</span>
<span id="ii.CXII-Page_547"></span>But both, the one within a year after
the other, began to prophesy that which seemeth to pertain to the
restoration of the temple, as was foretold so long before. <span
id="fr_5007"></span>[5008](#fn_5007.md) …“For the temple of God is holy,
which temple ye are.” <span id="fr_5008"></span>[5009](#fn_5008.md) Whoever
therefore converteth himself to the work of this building together, and
to the hope of a firm and holy edifice, like a living stone from the
miserable ruin of this world, understandeth the title of the Psalm,
understandeth “the conversion of Haggai and Zechariah.” Let him
therefore chant the following verses, not so much with the voice of his
tongue as of his life. For the completion of the building will be that
ineffable peace of wisdom, the “beginning” of which is the “fear of the
Lord:” let him therefore, whom this conversion buildeth together, begin
thence.

<span id="ii.CXII-p7"></span>2. “Blessed is the man that feareth the
Lord: he will have great delight in His commandments” ([Psa.
112.1](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#001)<span id="ii.CXII-p7.1"></span>.md).
God, who alone judgeth both truthfully and mercifully, will see how far
he obeyeth His commandments: since “the life of man on earth is a
temptation,” <span id="fr_5009"></span>[5010](#fn_5009.md) as holy Job
saith. But “He who judgeth us is the Lord.” <span
id="fr_5010"></span>[5011](#fn_5010.md) …He therefore will see how far each
man profiteth in His commandments; yet he who loveth the peace of this
building together, shall have great delight in them; nor ought he to
despair, since there is “peace on earth for men of good will.” <span
id="fr_5011"></span>[5012](#fn_5011.md)

<span id="ii.CXII-p11"></span>3. Next follows, “His seed shall be mighty
upon earth” ([Psa. 112.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#002.md)<span
id="ii.CXII-p11.1"></span>). The Apostle witnesseth, that the works of
mercy are the seed of the future harvest, when he saith, “Let us not be
weary in well doing, for in due season we shall reap;” <span
id="fr_5012"></span>[5013](#fn_5012.md) and again, “But this I say, He
which soweth sparingly, shall reap also sparingly.” <span
id="fr_5013"></span>[5014](#fn_5013.md) But what, brethren, is more mighty
than that not only Zacchæus should buy the kingdom of Heaven by the half
of his goods, <span id="fr_5014"></span>[5015](#fn_5014.md) but even the
widow for two mites, <span id="fr_5015"></span>[5016](#fn_5015.md) and that
each should possess an equal share there? What is more mighty, than that
the same kingdom should be worth treasures to the rich man, and a cup of
cold water to the poor?…“Glory and riches shall be in his house” ([Psa.
112.3](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#003.md)<span
id="ii.CXII-p15.2"></span>). For his house is his heart; where, with the
praise of God, he liveth in greater riches with the hope of eternal
life, than with men flattering, in palaces of marble, with splendidly
adorned ceilings, with the fear of everlasting death. “For his
righteousness endureth for ever:” this is his glory, there are his
riches. While the other’s purple, and fine linen, and grand banquets,
even when present, are passing away; and when they have come to an end,
the burning tongue shall cry out, longing for a drop of water from the
finger’s end. <span id="fr_5016"></span>[5017](#fn_5016.md)

<span id="ii.CXII-p17"></span>4. “Unto the right-hearted there ariseth
up light in the darkness” ([Psa.
112.4](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#004.md)<span
id="ii.CXII-p17.1"></span>). Justly do the godly direct their heart unto
their God, justly do they walk with their God, preferring His will to
themselves; and having no proud presumption in their own. For they
remember that they were some time in darkness, but are now light in the
Lord. <span id="fr_5017"></span>[5018](#fn_5017.md) “Merciful, pitying, and
just is the Lord God.” It delighteth us that He is “merciful and
pitying,” but it perhaps terrifieth us that the Lord God is “just.” Fear
not, despair not at all, happy man, who fearest the Lord, and hast great
delight in His commandments; be thou sweet, be merciful and lend. For
the Lord is just in this manner, that He judgeth without mercy him who
hath not shown mercy; <span id="fr_5018"></span>[5019](#fn_5018.md) but,
“Sweet is the man who is merciful and lendeth” ([Psa.
112.5](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#005.md)<span
id="ii.CXII-p19.2"></span>): God will not spew him out of His mouth as
if he were not sweet. “Forgive,” He saith, “and ye shall be forgiven;
give, and it shall be given unto you.” <span
id="fr_5019"></span>[5020](#fn_5019.md) Whilst thou forgivest that thou
mayest be forgiven, thou art merciful; whilst thou givest that it may be
given unto thee, thou lendest. For though all be called generally mercy
where another is assisted in his distress, yet there is a difference
where thou spendest neither money, nor the toil of bodily labour, but by
forgiving what each man hath sinned against thee, thou gainest free
pardon for thine own sins also.…He who is unwilling to give to the poor,
seeketh riches; listen to what is written, “Thou shalt have treasure in
heaven.” <span id="fr_5020"></span>[5021](#fn_5020.md) Thou wilt not then
lose honour by forgiving: for it is a very laudable triumph to conquer
anger: wilt not grow poor by giving; for a heavenly treasure is a more
safe possession. The former verse, “Riches and plenteousness shall be in
his house,” was pregnant with this verse.

<span id="ii.CXII-p22"></span>5. He therefore who doth these things,
“shall guide his words with discretion.” His deeds themselves are the
words whereby he shall be defended at the Judgment; which shall not be
without mercy unto him, since he hath himself shown mercy. “For he shall
never be moved” ([Psa. 112.6](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#006.md)<span
id="ii.CXII-p22.1"></span>): he who, called to the right hand, shall
hear these words, “Come, ye blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom
prepared for you from the foundation of the world.” For no works of
theirs, save works of mercy, are there mentioned. He therefore shall
hear, “Come, ye blessed of My Father;” for, “the generation of the right
ones shall be blessed.” Thus, “the righteous shall be had in everlasting
remembrance.” “He will not be afraid of any evil hearing; for his heart
standeth fast and believeth <span id="page_548">p. 548</span> <span
id="ii.CXII-Page_548"></span>in the Lord” ([Psa.
112.7](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#007.md)<span
id="ii.CXII-p22.2"></span>). Such as the words which he will hear
addressed to those on the left hand, “Depart into everlasting fire,
prepared for the devil and his angels.” <span
id="fr_5021"></span>[5022](#fn_5021.md) He therefore who seeketh here not
his own things, but those of Jesus Christ, <span
id="fr_5022"></span>[5023](#fn_5022.md) most patiently endureth sufferings,
waiteth for the promises with faith. Nor is he broken down by any
temptations: “His heart is established, and will not shrink, until he
see beyond his enemies” ([Psa.
112.8](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#008.md)<span
id="ii.CXII-p24.2"></span>). His enemies wished to see good things here,
and when invisible blessings were promised them, used to say, “Who will
show us any good?” <span id="fr_5023"></span>[5024](#fn_5023.md) Let our
heart therefore be established, and shrink not, until we see beyond our
enemies. For they wish to see good things of men in the land of the
dying; we trust to see the good things of the Lord in the land of the
living. <span id="fr_5024"></span>[5025](#fn_5024.md)

<span id="ii.CXII-p27"></span>6. But it is a great thing to have the
heart established, and not to be moved, while they rejoice who love what
they see, and mock at him who hopeth for what he seeth not; “what the
Lord hath prepared for them that love Him.” <span
id="fr_5025"></span>[5026](#fn_5025.md) How great is the value of this
which is not seen, and it is bought for so much as each man is able to
give for it. On this account he also “dispersed abroad, and gave to the
poor” ([Psa. 112.9](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#009.md)<span
id="ii.CXII-p28.2"></span>): he saw not, yet he kept buying; but He was
storing up the treasure in heaven, who deigned to hunger and thirst in
the poor on earth. It is no wonder then if “his righteousness remaineth
for ever:” He who created the ages being his guardian. “His horn,” whose
humility was scorned by the proud, “shall be exalted with honour.”

<span id="ii.CXII-p29"></span>7. “The ungodly shall see it, and he shall
be angered” ([Psa. 112.10](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#010.md)<span
id="ii.CXII-p29.1"></span>): this is that late and fruitless repentance.
For with whom rather than himself is he “angered,” when he shall say,
“Our pride, what hath it profited us? the boastfulness of our riches,
what hath it given us? <span id="fr_5026"></span>[5027](#fn_5026.md) ”
seeing the horn of him exalted with honour, who “dispersed abroad, and
gave to the poor.” “He shall gnash with his teeth, and consume away:”
for “there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.” For he will no more
bring forth leaves and bloom, as would happen if he had repented in
season: but he will then repent, when “the desire of the ungodly shall
perish,” no consolation succeeding. “The desire of the ungodly shall
perish,” when “all things shall pass away like a shadow,” <span
id="fr_5027"></span>[5028](#fn_5027.md) when the flower shall fall down on
the withering of the grass. “But the word of the Lord that endureth for
ever,” <span id="fr_5028"></span>[5029](#fn_5028.md) as it is mocked by the
vanity of the falsely happy, so will laugh at the perdition of the same
when truly miserable.
