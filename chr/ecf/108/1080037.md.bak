<span id="ii.XXXIII-p1"></span> <span id="ii.XXXIII-p1.1"></span><span
class="c20"><span id="ii.XXXIII-p1.2"></span>Psalm XXXIII. <span
id="fr_694"></span>[695](#fn_694.md) </span>

<span id="ii.XXXIII-p3"></span>1. “Rejoice in the Lord, O ye righteous:”
rejoice, O ye righteous, not in yourselves, for that is not safe; but in
the Lord. “For praise is comely to the upright” ([Psa.
33.1](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#001.md)<span
id="ii.XXXIII-p3.1"></span>): these praise the Lord, who submit
themselves unto the Lord; for else they are distorted and perverse.

<span id="ii.XXXIII-p4"></span>2. “Praise the Lord with harp:” praise
the Lord, presenting unto Him your bodies a living sacrifice. <span
id="fr_695"></span>[696](#fn_695.md) “Sing unto Him with the psaltery for
ten strings” ([Psa. 33.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#002.md)<span
id="ii.XXXIII-p5.2"></span>): let your members be servants to the love
of God, and of your neighbour, in which are kept both the three and the
seven commandments. <span id="fr_696"></span>[697](#fn_696.md)

<span id="ii.XXXIII-p7"></span>3. “Sing unto Him a new song:” sing unto
Him a song of the grace of faith. “Sing skilfully unto Him with
jubilation” ([Psa. 33.3](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#003.md)<span
id="ii.XXXIII-p7.1"></span>): sing skillfully unto Him with rejoicing.

<span id="ii.XXXIII-p8"></span>4. “For the Word of the Lord is right:”
for the Word of the Lord is right, to make you that which of yourselves
ye cannot be. “And all His works are done in faith” ([Psa.
33.4](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#004.md)<span
id="ii.XXXIII-p8.1"></span>): lest any think that by the merit of works
he hath arrived at faith, when in faith are done all the works which God
Himself loveth.

<span id="ii.XXXIII-p9"></span>5. “He loveth Mercy and Judgment:” for He
loveth Mercy, which now He showeth first; and Judgment, wherewith He
exacteth that which He hath first shown. “The earth is full of the Mercy
of the Lord” ([Psa. 33.5](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#005.md)<span
id="ii.XXXIII-p9.1"></span>): throughout the whole world are sins
forgiven unto men by the Mercy of the Lord.

<span id="ii.XXXIII-p10"></span>6. “By the Word of the Lord were the
heavens made firm:” for not by themselves, but by the Word of the Lord
were the righteous made strong. “And all the strength <span
id="fr_697"></span>[698](#fn_697.md) of them by the Breath of His Mouth”
([Psa. 33.6](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#006.md)<span
id="ii.XXXIII-p11.1"></span>). And all their faith by His Holy Spirit.

<span id="ii.XXXIII-p12"></span>7. “He gathereth the waters of the sea
together as into a bottle:” He gathered the people of the world
together, to confession of mortified sin, lest through pride they flow
too freely. “He layeth up the deep in storehouses” ([Psa.
33.7](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#007.md)<span
id="ii.XXXIII-p12.1"></span>): and keepeth in them His secrets for
riches.

<span id="ii.XXXIII-p13"></span>8. “Let all the earth fear the Lord:”
let <span id="page_72">p. 72</span> <span
id="ii.XXXIII-Page_72"></span>every sinner fear, that so he may cease to
sin. “Let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of Him” ([Psa.
33.8](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#008.md)<span
id="ii.XXXIII-p13.1"></span>): not of the terrors of men, or of any
creature, but of Him let them stand in awe.

<span id="ii.XXXIII-p14"></span>9. “For He spake, and they were made:”
for no other one made those things which are to fear; but He spake, and
they were made. “He commanded, and they were created” ([Psa.
33.9](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#009.md)<span
id="ii.XXXIII-p14.1"></span>): He commanded by His Word, <span
id="fr_698"></span>[699](#fn_698.md) and they were created.

<span id="ii.XXXIII-p16"></span>10. “The Lord bringeth the counsel of
the heathen to nought;” of them that seek not His Kingdom, but kingdoms
of their own. “He maketh the devices of the people of none effect:” of
them that covet earthly happiness. “And reproveth the counsels of
princes” ([Psa. 33.10](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#010.md)<span
id="ii.XXXIII-p16.1"></span>): of them that seek to rule over such
peoples.

<span id="ii.XXXIII-p17"></span>11. “But the counsel of the Lord
standeth for ever;” but the counsel of the Lord, whereby He maketh none
blessed but him that submitteth unto Himself, standeth for ever. The
thoughts of His Heart to all generations” ([Psa.
33.11](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#011.md)<span
id="ii.XXXIII-p17.1"></span>): the thoughts of His Wisdom are not
mutable, but endure to all generations.

<span id="ii.XXXIII-p18"></span>12. “Blessed is the nation whose God is
the Lord:” one nation is blessed, belonging to the heavenly city, which
hath not chosen save the Lord for their God: “And the people whom He
hath chosen for His own inheritance” ([Psa.
33.12](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#012.md)<span
id="ii.XXXIII-p18.1"></span>): and which not of itself, but by the gift
of God, hath been chosen, that He by possessing it may not suffer it to
be uncared for and miserable.

<span id="ii.XXXIII-p19"></span>13. “The Lord looketh from Heaven; He
beholdeth all the sons of men” ([Psa.
33.13](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#013.md)<span
id="ii.XXXIII-p19.1"></span>). From the souls of the righteous, the Lord
looketh mercifully upon all who would rise to newness of life.

<span id="ii.XXXIII-p20"></span>14. “From His prepared habitation:” from
His habitation of assumed Humanity, which He prepared for Himself. “He
looketh upon all the inhabitants of the earth” ([Psa.
33.14](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#014.md)<span
id="ii.XXXIII-p20.1"></span>): He looketh mercifully upon all who live
in the flesh, that He may be over them in ruling them.

<span id="ii.XXXIII-p21"></span>15. “He fashioneth their hearts singly:”
He giveth spiritually to their hearts their proper gifts, so that
neither the whole body may be eye, nor the whole hearing; <span
id="fr_699"></span>[700](#fn_699.md) but that one in this manner, another
in that manner, may be incorporated with Christ. “He understandeth all
their works” ([Psa. 33.15](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#015.md)<span
id="ii.XXXIII-p22.2"></span>). Before Him are all their works
understood.

<span id="ii.XXXIII-p23"></span>16. “A king shall not be saved by much
strength:” he shall not be saved who ruleth his own flesh, if he presume
much upon his own strength. “Neither shall a giant be saved by much
strength” ([Psa. 33.16](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#016.md)<span
id="ii.XXXIII-p23.1"></span>): nor shall he be saved whoever warreth
against the habit of his own lust, or against the devil and his angels,
if he trust much to his own might.

<span id="ii.XXXIII-p24"></span>17. “A horse is a deceitful thing for
safety:” he is deceived, who thinketh either that through men he gaineth
salvation received among men, or that by the impetuosity of his own
courage he is defended from destruction. “In the abundance of his
strength shall he not be saved” ([Psa.
33.17](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#017.md)<span
id="ii.XXXIII-p24.1"></span>).

<span id="ii.XXXIII-p25"></span>18. “Behold, the Eyes of the Lord are
upon them that fear Him:” because if thou seek salvation, behold, the
love of the Lord is upon them that fear Him. “Upon them that hope in His
mercy” ([Psa. 33.18](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#018.md)<span
id="ii.XXXIII-p25.1"></span>): that hope not in their own strength, but
in His mercy.

<span id="ii.XXXIII-p26"></span>19. “To deliver their souls from death,
and to keep them alive in famine” ([Psa.
33.19](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#019.md)<span
id="ii.XXXIII-p26.1"></span>). To give them the nourishment of the Word,
and of Everlasting Truth, which they lost while presuming on their own
strength, and therefore have not even their own strength, from lack of
righteousness.

<span id="ii.XXXIII-p27"></span>20. “My soul shall be patient for the
Lord:” that hereafter it may be filled with dainties incorruptible,
meanwhile, whilst here it remaineth, my soul shall be patient for the
Lord. “For He is our Helper and Defender” ([Psa.
33.20](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#020.md)<span
id="ii.XXXIII-p27.1"></span>): our Helper He is, while we endeavour
after Him; and our Defender, while we resist the adversary.

<span id="ii.XXXIII-p28"></span>21. “For our heart shall rejoice in
Him:” for not in ourselves, wherein without Him there is great need; but
in Himself shall our heart rejoice. “And we have trusted in His holy
Name” ([Psa. 33.21](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#021.md)<span
id="ii.XXXIII-p28.1"></span>); and therefore have we trusted that we
shall come to God, because unto us absent hath He sent, through faith,
His own Name.

<span id="ii.XXXIII-p29"></span>22. “Let Thy mercy, O Lord, be upon us,
according as we have hoped in Thee” ([Psa.
33.22](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#022.md)<span
id="ii.XXXIII-p29.1"></span>): let Thy mercy, O Lord, be upon us; for
hope confoundeth not, because we have hoped in Thee.
