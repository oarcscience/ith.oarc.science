<span id="ii.LXII"></span>

<span id="ii.LXII-p1"></span> <span id="ii.LXII-p1.1"></span><span
class="c20"><span id="ii.LXII-p1.2"></span>Psalm LXII. <span
id="fr_2357"></span>[2358](#fn_2357.md) </span>

<span id="ii.LXII-p3"></span>1. The title of it is, “Unto the end, in
behalf of Idithun, a Psalm to David himself.” I recollect that
already <span id="fr_2358"></span>[2359](#fn_2358.md) to you hath been
explained what Idithun is.…Let us see how far he hath leaped over, and
whom he hath “leaped over,” and in what place, though he hath leaped
over certain men, he is situate, whence as from a kind of spiritual and
secure position he may behold what is below.…He being set, I say, in a
certain fortified place, doth say, “Shall not my soul be subject to
God?” ([Psa. 62.1](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#001.md)<span
id="ii.LXII-p4.2"></span>). For he had heard, “He that doth exalt
himself shall be humbled; and he that humbleth himself shall be
exalted:” <span id="fr_2359"></span>[2360](#fn_2359.md) and fearful lest by
leaping over he should be proud, not elated by those things which were
below, but humble because of Him that was above; to envious men, as it
were threatening to him a fall, who were grieved that he had leaped
over, he hath made answer, “Shall not my soul be subject to God?”…“For
from Himself is my salvation.” “For Himself is my God and my salvation,
my taker up, I shall not be moved more” ([Psa.
62.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#002)<span id="ii.LXII-p5.2"></span>.md).
I know who is above me, I know who stretcheth forth His mercy to men
that know Him, I know under the coverings of whose wings I should hope:
“I shall not be moved more.”…

<span id="ii.LXII-p6"></span>2. Therefore, down from the higher place
fortified and protected, he, to whom the Lord hath been made a refuge,
he, to whom is God Himself for a fortified place, <span
id="fr_2360"></span>[2361](#fn_2360.md) hath regard to those whom he hath
leaped over, and looking down upon them speaketh as though from a lofty
tower: for this also hath been said of Him, “A Tower of strength from
the face of the enemy:” <span id="fr_2361"></span>[2362](#fn_2361.md) he
giveth heed therefore to them, and saith, “How long do ye lay upon a
man?” ([Psa. 62.3](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#003.md)<span
id="ii.LXII-p8.2"></span>). By insulting, by hurling reproaches, by
laying wait, by persecuting, ye lay upon a man burthens, ye lay upon a
man as much as a man can bear: <span
id="fr_2362"></span>[2363](#fn_2362.md) but in order that a man may bear,
under him is He that hath made man. If to a man ye look, “slay ye, all
of you.” Behold, lay upon, rage, “slay ye, all of you.” “As though a
wall bowed down, and as a fence smitten against;” lean against, smite
against, as if going to throw down. And where is, “I shall not be moved
more”? But wherefore? “I shall not be moved more.” Because Himself is
God my Saving One, my taker up, therefore ye men are able to lay burdens
upon a man; can ye anywise lay upon God, who protecteth man? “Slay ye,
all of you.” What is that size of body in one man so great as that he
may be slain by all? But we ought to perceive our person, the person of
the Church, the person of the Body of Christ. For one Man with His Head
and Body is Jesus Christ, the Saviour of the Body and the Members of the
Body: two in one Flesh, <span id="fr_2363"></span>[2364](#fn_2363.md) and
in one voice, and in one passion, and, when iniquity shall have passed
over, in one rest. The sufferings therefore of Christ are not in Christ
alone; nay, there are not any save in Christ. For if Christ thou
understandest to be Head and Body, the sufferings of Christ are not,
save in Christ: but if Christ thou understand of Head alone, the
sufferings of Christ are not in Christ alone. For if the sufferings of
Christ are in Christ alone, to wit in the Head alone; whence saith a
certain member of Him, Paul the Apostle, “In order that I may supply
what are wanting of the oppressions of Christ in my flesh”? <span
id="fr_2364"></span>[2365](#fn_2364.md) If therefore <span id="page_252">p.
252</span> <span id="ii.LXII-Page_252"></span>in the members of Christ
thou art, whatsoever man thou art that art hearing these words,
whosoever thou art that dost hear these words (but however, thou dost
hear, if in the members of Christ thou art): whatsoever thing thou
sufferest from those that are not in the members of Christ, was wanting
to the sufferings of Christ. Therefore it is added because it was
wanting; thou fillest up the measure, thou causest it not to run over:
thou sufferest so much as was to be contributed out of thy sufferings to
the whole suffering of Christ, that hath suffered in our Head, and doth
suffer in His members, that is, in our own selves. Unto this our common
republic, as it were each of us according to our measure payeth that
which we owe, and according to the powers which we have, as it were a
quota <span id="fr_2365"></span>[2366](#fn_2365.md) of sufferings we
contribute. The storehouse <span id="fr_2366"></span>[2367](#fn_2366.md) of
all men’s sufferings will not be completely made up, save when the world
shall have been ended.…That whole City therefore is speaking, from the
blood of righteous Abel even to the blood of Zacharias. <span
id="fr_2367"></span>[2368](#fn_2367.md) Thence also hereafter from the
blood of John, through the blood of the Apostles, through the blood of
Martyrs, through the blood of the faithful ones of Christ, one City
speaketh, one man saith, “How long do ye lay upon a man? Slay ye, all of
you.” Let us see if ye efface, let us see if ye extinguish, let us see
if ye remove from the earth the name thereof, let us see if ye peoples
do not meditate of empty things, <span
id="fr_2368"></span>[2369](#fn_2368.md) saying, “When shall She die, and
when shall perish the name of Her?” <span
id="fr_2369"></span>[2370](#fn_2369.md) “As though She were a wall bowed
down, and a fence smitten against,” <span
id="fr_2370"></span>[2371](#fn_2370.md) lean ye against Her, smite against
Her. Hear from above: <span id="fr_2371"></span>[2372](#fn_2371.md) “My
taker up, I shall not be moved more:” for as though a heap of sand I
have been smitten against that I might fall, and the Lord hath taken me
up.

<span id="ii.LXII-p19"></span>3. “Nevertheless, mine honour they have
thought to drive back” ([Psa.
62.4](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#004)<span id="ii.LXII-p19.1"></span>.md).
Conquered while they slay men yielding, by the blood of the slain
multiplying the faithful, yielding to these and no longer being able to
kill; “Nevertheless, mine honour they have thought to drive back.” Now
because a Christian cannot be killed, pains are taken that a Christian
should be dishonoured. For now by the honour of Christians the hearts of
ungodly men are tortured: now that spiritual Joseph, after his selling
by his brethren, after his removal from his home into Egypt as though
into the Gentiles, after the humiliation of a prison, <span
id="fr_2372"></span>[2373](#fn_2372.md) after the made-up tale of a false
witness, after that there had come to pass that which of him was said,
“Iron passed through the soul of him:” <span
id="fr_2373"></span>[2374](#fn_2373.md) now he is honoured, now he is not
made subject to brethren selling him, but corn he supplieth to them
hungering. <span id="fr_2374"></span>[2375](#fn_2374.md) Conquered by his
humility and chastity, uncorruptness, temptations, sufferings, now
honoured they see him, and his honour they think to check.…Is it all
against one man, or one man against all; or all against all, or one
against one? Meanwhile, when he saith, “ye lay upon a man,” it is as it
were upon one man: and when he saith, “Slay all ye,” it is as if all men
were against one man: but nevertheless it is also all against all,
because also all are Christians, but in One. But why must those divers
errors hostile to Christ be spoken of as all together? Are they also
one? Truly them also as one I dare to speak of: because there is one
City and one city, one People and one people, King and king. One City
and one city is what? Babylon one, Jerusalem one. By whatsoever other
mystical names besides She is called, yet One City there is and one
city; over this the devil is king, over that Christ is King.…

<span id="ii.LXII-p23"></span>4. Give heed, brethren, give heed, I
entreat you. For it delighteth me yet to speak a few words to you of
this beloved City. For “most glorious things of Thee have been spoken,
City of God.” <span id="fr_2375"></span>[2376](#fn_2375.md) And, “if I
forget Thee, O Jerusalem, let mine own right hand forget me.” <span
id="fr_2376"></span>[2377](#fn_2376.md) For dear is the one Country, and
truly but one Country, the only Country: besides Her whatsoever we have,
is a sojourning in a strange land. I will say therefore that which ye
may acknowledge, that of which ye may approve: I will call to your minds
that which ye know, I will not teach that which ye know not. “Not
first,” saith the Apostle, “that which is spiritual, but that which is
natural, <span id="fr_2377"></span>[2378](#fn_2377.md) afterwards that
which is spiritual.” <span id="fr_2378"></span>[2379](#fn_2378.md)
Therefore the former city is greater by age, because first was born
Cain, and afterwards Abel: <span id="fr_2379"></span>[2380](#fn_2379.md)
but in these the elder shall serve the younger. <span
id="fr_2380"></span>[2381](#fn_2380.md) The former greater by age, the
latter greater in dignity. Wherefore is the former greater by age?
Because “not first that which is spiritual, but that which is
natural.” <span id="fr_2381"></span>[2382](#fn_2381.md) Wherefore is the
latter greater in dignity? Because “the elder shall serve the
younger.” <span id="fr_2382"></span>[2383](#fn_2382.md) …Cain first builded
a city, and in that place he builded where no city was. But when
Jerusalem was being builded, it was not builded in a place where there
was not a city, but there was a city at first which was called Jebus,
whence the Jebusites. This having been captured, overcome, made subject,
there was builded a new city, as though the old were thrown down; and it
was called Jerusalem, <span id="fr_2383"></span>[2384](#fn_2383.md) vision
of peace, City of God. Each one therefore that is born of Adam, not yet
doth belong to Jerusalem: for he beareth with him <span id="page_253">p.
253</span> <span id="ii.LXII-Page_253"></span>the offshoot <span
id="fr_2384"></span>[2385](#fn_2384.md) of iniquity, and the punishment of
sin, having been consigned to death, and he belongeth in a manner to a
sort of old city. But if he is to be in the people of God; his old self
will be thrown down, and he will be builded up new. For this reason
therefore Cain builded a city where there was not a city. For from
mortality and from naughtiness every one setteth out, in order that he
may be made good hereafter. “For as by the disobedience of one man many
were made sinners, so by the obedience of One Man many shall be made
just.” <span id="fr_2385"></span>[2386](#fn_2385.md) And all we in Adam do
die: <span id="fr_2386"></span>[2387](#fn_2386.md) and each one of us of
Adam was born. Let him pass over to Jerusalem, he shall be thrown down
old, and shall be builded new. As though to conquered Jebusites, in
order that there may be builded up Jerusalem, is said, “Put ye off the
old man, and put on the new.” <span id="fr_2387"></span>[2388](#fn_2387.md)
And now to them builded in Jerusalem, and shining by the light of Grace,
is said, “Ye have been sometime darkness, but now light in the
Lord.” <span id="fr_2388"></span>[2389](#fn_2388.md) The evil city
therefore from the beginning even unto the end doth run on, and the good
City by the changing of evil men is builded up. And these two cities are
meanwhile mingled, at the end to be severed; against each other mutually
in conflict, the one for iniquity, the other for the truth. And
sometimes this very temporal mingling bringeth it to pass that certain
men belonging to the city Babylon, do order matters belonging to
Jerusalem, and again certain men belonging to Jerusalem, do order
matters belonging to Babylon. Something difficult I seem to have
propounded. Be ye patient, until it be proved by examples. “For all
things” in the old people, as writeth the Apostle, “in a figure used to
befall them: but they have been written for our amendment, upon whom the
end of the world hath come.” <span id="fr_2389"></span>[2390](#fn_2389.md)
Regard therefore that people as also set to intimate an after people;
and see then what I say. There were great <span
id="fr_2390"></span>[2391](#fn_2390.md) kings in Jerusalem: it is a known
fact, they are enumerated, are named. They all were, I say, wicked
citizens of Babylon, and they were ordering matters of Jerusalem: all
men from thence to be dissevered at the end, to no one but to the devil
do belong. Again we find citizens of Jerusalem to have ordered certain
matters belonging to Babylon. For those three children, Nabuchodonosor,
overcome by a miracle, made the ministers of his kingdom, and set them
over his Satraps; and so there were ordering the matters of Babylon
citizens of Jerusalem. <span id="fr_2391"></span>[2392](#fn_2391.md)
Observe now how this is being fulfilled and done in the Church, and in
these times.…Every earthly commonwealth, sometime assuredly to perish,
whereof the kingdom is to pass away, when there shall come that kingdom,
whereof we pray, “Thy kingdom come;” <span
id="fr_2392"></span>[2393](#fn_2392.md) and whereof hath been foretold,
“And of His kingdom shall be no end:” <span
id="fr_2393"></span>[2394](#fn_2393.md) an earthly commonwealth, I say,
hath our citizens conducting the affairs of it. For how many faithful,
how many good men, are both magistrates in their cities, and are judges,
and are generals, and are counts, and are kings? All that are just and
good men, having not anything in heart but the most glorious things,
which of Thee have been said, City of God. <span
id="fr_2394"></span>[2395](#fn_2394.md) And as if they were doing
bond-service <span id="fr_2395"></span>[2396](#fn_2395.md) in the city
which is to pass away, even there by the doctors of the Holy City they
are bidden to keep faith with those set over them, “whether with the
king as supreme, or with governors as though sent by God for the
punishment of evil men, but for the praise of good men: ” <span
id="fr_2396"></span>[2397](#fn_2396.md) or as servants, that to their
masters they should be subject, <span
id="fr_2397"></span>[2398](#fn_2397.md) even Christians to Heathens, and
the better should keep faith with the worse, for a time to serve, for
everlasting to have dominion. For these things do happen until iniquity
do pass away. <span id="fr_2398"></span>[2399](#fn_2398.md) Servants are
commanded to bear with masters unjust and capricious: the citizens of
Babylon are commanded to be endured by the citizens of Jerusalem,
showing even more attentions, than if they were citizens of the same
Babylon, as though fulfilling the precept, “He that shall have exacted
of thee a mile, go with him other twain.” <span
id="fr_2399"></span>[2400](#fn_2399.md) …

<span id="ii.LXII-p49"></span>5. “I have run in thirst.” <span
id="fr_2400"></span>[2401](#fn_2400.md) For they were rendering evil things
for good things: <span id="fr_2401"></span>[2402](#fn_2401.md) for them was
I thirsting: mine honour they thought to drive back: I was thirsting to
bring them over into my body. For in drinking what do we, but send into
our members liquor that is without, and suck it into our body? Thus did
Moses in that head of the calf. <span
id="fr_2402"></span>[2403](#fn_2402.md) The head of the calf is a great
sacrament. <span id="fr_2403"></span>[2404](#fn_2403.md) For the head of
the calf was the body of ungodly men, in the similitude of a calf eating
hay, <span id="fr_2404"></span>[2405](#fn_2404.md) seeking earthly things:
because all flesh is hay. <span id="fr_2405"></span>[2406](#fn_2405.md)
…And what now is more evident, than that into that City Jerusalem, of
which the people Israel was a type, by Baptism men were to be made to
pass over? Therefore in water it was scattered, in order that for drink
it might be given. For this even unto the end this man thirsteth; he
runneth and thirsteth. For many men He drinketh, but never will He be
without thirst. For thence is, “I thirst, woman, give Me to
drink.” <span id="fr_2406"></span>[2407](#fn_2406.md) That Samaritan <span
id="page_254">p. 254</span> <span id="ii.LXII-Page_254"></span>woman at
the well found the Lord thirsting, and by Him thirsting she was filled:
she first found Him thirsting, in order that He might drink her
believing. And when He was on the Cross, “I thirst,” <span
id="fr_2407"></span>[2408](#fn_2407.md) He said, although they gave not to
Him that for which He was thirsting. For for themselves He was
thirsting: but they gave vinegar, not new wine, wherewith are filled up
the new bottles, but old wine, but old to its loss. <span
id="fr_2408"></span>[2409](#fn_2408.md) For old vinegar also is said of the
old men, of whom hath been said, “For to them is no changing;” <span
id="fr_2409"></span>[2410](#fn_2409.md) namely, that the Jebusites should
be overthrown, and Jerusalem be builded. <span
id="fr_2410"></span>[2411](#fn_2410.md)

<span id="ii.LXII-p61"></span>6. So also the Head of this body even unto
the end from the beginning runneth in thirst. And as if to Him were
being said, Why in thirst? what is wanting to Thee, O Body of Christ, O
Church of Christ? in so great honour, in so great exaltation, in so
great height also even in this world established, what is wanting to
Thee? There is fulfilled that which hath been foretold of thee, “There
shall adore Him all kings of the earth, all nations shall serve Him.”
 <span id="fr_2411"></span>[2412](#fn_2411.md) …They that at Jerusalem’s
festivals fill up the Churches, at Babylon’s festivals fill up the
theatres: and for all they serve, honour, obey Her—not only those very
persons that bear the Sacraments of Christ, and hate the commandments of
Christ, but also they, that bear not even the mere Sacraments, Heathen
though they be, Jews though they be,—they honour, praise, proclaim, “but
with their mouths they were blessing.” I heed not the mouth, He knoweth
that hath instructed me, “with their heart they were cursing.” In that
place they were cursing, where “mine honour they thought to drive back.”

<span id="ii.LXII-p63"></span>7. What dost Thou, O Idithun, Body of
Christ, leaping over them? What dost Thou amid all these things? What
wilt Thou? wilt faint? wilt Thou not persevere even unto the end? wilt
Thou not hearken, “He that shall have persevered even unto the end, the
same shall be saved,” <span id="fr_2412"></span>[2413](#fn_2412.md) though
for that iniquity aboundeth, the love of many shall wax cold? <span
id="fr_2413"></span>[2414](#fn_2413.md) And where is it that Thou hast
leaped over them? where is it that Thy conversation is in Heaven? <span
id="fr_2414"></span>[2415](#fn_2414.md) But they cleave unto earthly
things, as though earthborn they mind the earth, and are earth, the
serpent’s food. <span id="fr_2415"></span>[2416](#fn_2415.md) What dost
thou amid these things?…“Nevertheless, to God my soul shall be made
subject” ([Psa. 62.5](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#005.md)<span
id="ii.LXII-p67.2"></span>). And who would endure so great things,
either open wars, or secret lyings-in-wait? Who would endure so great
things amid open enemies, amid false brethren? Who would endure so great
things? Would a man? and if a man would, would a man of himself? I have
not so leaped over that I should be lifted up, and fall: “To God my soul
shall be made subject: for from Himself is my patience.” What patience
is there amid so great scandals, except that “if for that which we do
not see we hope, through patience we look for it”? <span
id="fr_2416"></span>[2417](#fn_2416.md) There cometh my pain, there will
come my rest also; there cometh my tribulation, there will come my
cleansing also. For doth gold glitter in the furnace of the refiner? In
a necklace it will glitter, in an ornament it will glitter: let it
suffer however the furnace, in order that being cleansed from dross it
may come into light. This is the furnace, there is there chaff, there
gold, there fire, into this bloweth the refiner: in the furnace burneth
the chaff, and the gold is cleansed; the one into ashes is turned, of
dross the other is cleansed. The furnace is the world, the chaff
unrighteous men, the gold just men; the fire tribulation, the refiner
God: that which therefore the refiner willeth I do; wherever the Maker
setteth me I endure it. I am commanded to endure, He knoweth how to
cleanse. Though there burn the chaff to set me on fire, and as if to
consume me; that into ashes is burned, I of dross am cleansed.
Wherefore? Because “to God my soul shall be made subject: for from
Himself is my patience.”

<span id="ii.LXII-p69"></span>8. “For Himself is my God and My Saving
One, my Taker up, I will not remove hence” ([Psa.
62.6](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#006)<span id="ii.LXII-p69.1"></span>.md).
Because “Himself is my God,” therefore He calleth me: “and my Saving
One,” therefore He justifieth me: “and my Taker up,” therefore He
glorifieth me. For here I am called and am justified, but there I am
glorified; and from thence where I am glorified, “I will not remove.”
For a sojourner I am with Thee on earth as all my fathers were.
Therefore from my lodging I shall remove, from my Heavenly home I shall
not remove. “In God is my salvation and my glory” ([Psa.
62.7](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#007)<span id="ii.LXII-p69.2"></span>.md).
Saved I shall be in God, glorious I shall be in God: for not only saved,
but also glorious, saved, because a just man I have been made out of an
ungodly man, by Him justified; <span
id="fr_2417"></span>[2418](#fn_2417.md) but glorious, because not only
justified, but also honoured. For “those whom He hath predestined, those
also He hath called.” <span id="fr_2418"></span>[2419](#fn_2418.md) Calling
them, what hath He done here? “Whom He hath called, the same also He
hath justified; but whom He hath justified, the same also He hath
glorified.” Justification therefore to salvation belongeth, glorifying
to honour. How glorifying to honour belongeth, it is not needful to
discuss. How justification belongeth to salvation, let us seek some
proof. Behold there cometh to mind out of the Gospel: there were some
who to themselves were seeming to be just men, and they were finding
fault with the Lord because He <span id="page_255">p. 255</span> <span
id="ii.LXII-Page_255"></span>admitted to the feast sinners, and with
publicans and sinners was eating; to such men therefore priding
themselves, strong men of earth very much lifted up, much glorying of
their own soundness, such as they counted it, not such as they had, the
Lord answered what? “They that are whole need not a Physician, but they
that are sick.” <span id="fr_2419"></span>[2420](#fn_2419.md) Whom calleth
He whole, whom calleth He sick? He continueth and saith, “I have not
come to call just men, but sinners unto repentance.” <span
id="fr_2420"></span>[2421](#fn_2420.md) He hath called therefore “the
whole” just men, not because the Pharisees were so, but because
themselves they thought so to be; and for this reason were proud, and
grudged sick men a physician, and being more sick than those, they slew
the Physician. He hath called whole, however, righteous men, sick, the
sinners. My being justified therefore, saith that man that leapeth over,
from Himself I have: my being glorified, from Himself I have: “For God
is my salvation and my glory.” “My salvation,” so that saved I am: “my
glory,” so that honoured I am. This thing hereafter: now what? “God of
my help, and my hope is in God;” until I attain unto perfect
justification and salvation. “For by hope we are saved: but hope which
is seen, is not hope.” <span id="fr_2421"></span>[2422](#fn_2421.md) …

<span id="ii.LXII-p75"></span>9. “Hope ye in Him all the council of the
people” ([Psa. 62.8](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#008.md)<span
id="ii.LXII-p75.1"></span>). Imitate ye Idithun, leap over your enemies;
men fighting against you, stopping up your way, men hating you, leap ye
over: “Hope in Him all the council of the people: pour out before Him
your hearts:”…By imploring, by confessing, by hoping. Do not keep back
your hearts within your hearts: “Pour out before Him your hearts.” That
perisheth not which ye pour out. For He is my Taker up. If He taketh up,
why fearest thou to pour out? “Cast upon the Lord thy care, and hope in
Him.” <span id="fr_2422"></span>[2423](#fn_2422.md) What fear ye amid
whisperers, slanderers hateful to God, <span
id="fr_2423"></span>[2424](#fn_2423.md) where they are able openly
assailing, where they are unable secretly lying in wait, falsely
praising, truly at enmity, amid them what fear ye? “God is our Helper.”
Do they anywise equal God? Are they anywise stronger than He? “God is
our Helper,” be ye without care. “If God is for us, who is against
us?” <span id="fr_2424"></span>[2425](#fn_2424.md) “Pour out before Him
your hearts,” by leaping over unto Him, by lifting up your souls: “God
is our helper.”…“Nevertheless, vain are the sons of men, and liars are
the sons of men in the balances, in order that they may deceive, being
at one because of vanity” ([Psa.
62.9](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#009)<span id="ii.LXII-p78.2"></span>.md).
Certainly many men there are: behold there is that one man, that one man
that was cast forth from the multitude of guests.  <span
id="fr_2425"></span>[2426](#fn_2425.md) They conspire, they all seek things
temporal, and they that are carnal things carnal, and for the future
they hope them, whosoever do hope: even if because of variety of
opinions they are in division, nevertheless because of vanity they are
at one. Divers indeed are errors and of many forms, and the kingdom
against itself divided shall not stand: <span
id="fr_2426"></span>[2427](#fn_2426.md) but alike in all is the will vain
and lying, belonging to one king, with whom into fire everlasting it is
to be thrown headlong <span id="fr_2427"></span>[2428](#fn_2427.md) —“these
men because of vanity are at one.” And for them see how He thirsteth,
see how He runneth in thirst.

<span id="ii.LXII-p82"></span>10. He turneth therefore Himself to them,
thirsting for them: “Do not hope in iniquity” ([Psa.
62.10](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#010.md)<span
id="ii.LXII-p82.1"></span>). For my hope is in God. Ye that will not
draw near and pass over, “do not hope in iniquity.” For I that have
leapt over, my hope is in God; and is there anywise iniquity with
God? <span id="fr_2428"></span>[2429](#fn_2428.md) This thing let us do,
that thing let us do, of that thing let us think, thus let us adjust our
lyings in wait; “Because of vanity being at one.” Thou thirstest: they
that think of those things against thee are given up by those whom thou
drinkest, “Do not hope in vanity.” Vain is iniquity, nought is iniquity,
mighty is nothing save righteousness. Truth may be hidden for a time,
conquered it cannot be. Iniquity may flourish for a time, abide it
cannot. “Do not hope upon iniquity: and for robbery be not covetous.”
Thou art not rich, and wilt thou rob? What findest thou? What losest
thou? O losing gains! Thou findest money, thou losest righteousness.
“For robbery be not covetous.”…Therefore, vain sons of men, lying sons
of men, neither rob, nor, if there flow riches, set heart upon them: no
longer love vanity, and seek lying. For “blessed is the man who hath the
Lord God for his hope, and who hath not had regard unto vanities, and
lying follies.”  <span id="fr_2429"></span>[2430](#fn_2429.md) Ye would
deceive, ye would commit a fraud, what bring ye in order that ye may
cheat. Deceitful balances. For “lying,” he saith, “are the sons of men
in the balances,” in order that they may cheat by bringing forth
deceitful balances. By a false balance ye beguile men looking on: know
ye not that one is he that weigheth, Another He that judgeth of the
weight? He seeth not, for whom thou weighest, but He seeth that weigheth
thee and him. Therefore neither fraud nor robbery covet ye any longer,
nor on those things which ye have set your hope: <span
id="fr_2430"></span>[2431](#fn_2430.md) I have admonished, have foretold,
saith this Idithun.

<span id="ii.LXII-p86"></span>11. What followeth? “Once hath God spoken,
these two things I have heard, that power is of God ([Psa.
62.11](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#011.md)<span
id="ii.LXII-p86.1"></span>), and to Thee, O Lord, is mercy, for Thou
shalt render to each one after his works” ([Psa.
62.12](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#012.md)<span
id="ii.LXII-p86.2"></span>).…“Once hath God spoken.” What sayest thou,
Idithun? If thou that hadst leapt over them art saying, “Once He hath
<span id="page_256">p. 256</span> <span
id="ii.LXII-Page_256"></span>spoken;” I turn to another Scripture and it
saith to me, “In many quarters and in many ways formerly God hath spoken
to the fathers in the prophets.” <span
id="fr_2431"></span>[2432](#fn_2431.md) What is, “Once hath God spoken”? Is
He not the God that in the beginning of mankind spake to Adam? <span
id="fr_2432"></span>[2433](#fn_2432.md) Did not the Selfsame speak to Cain,
to Noe, to Abraham, to Isaac, to Jacob, to all the Prophets, and to
Moses? <span id="fr_2433"></span>[2434](#fn_2433.md) One man Moses was, and
how often to him spake God? Behold even to one man, not once but
ofttimes God hath spoken. Secondly, He hath spoken to the Son when
standing here, “Thou art My beloved Son.” <span
id="fr_2434"></span>[2435](#fn_2434.md) God hath spoken to the Apostles, He
hath spoken to all the Saints, even though not with voice sounding
through the cloud, nevertheless in the heart where He is Himself
Teacher. <span id="fr_2435"></span>[2436](#fn_2435.md) What is therefore,
“Once hath God spoken”? Much hath that man leapt over in order to arrive
at that place, where once God hath spoken. Behold briefly I have spoken
to your Love. Here among men, to men ofttimes, in many ways, in many
quarters, through creatures of many forms God hath spoken: by Himself
once God hath spoken, because One Word God hath begotten.…For it could
not be but that God did Himself know that which by the Word He made:
 <span id="fr_2436"></span>[2437](#fn_2436.md) but if that which He made He
knew, in Him there was that which was made before it was made. For if in
Him was not that which was made before it was made, how knew He that
which He made? For thou canst not say that God made things He knew not.
God therefore hath known that which He hath made. And how knew He before
He made, if there cannot be known any but things made? But by things
made there cannot be known any but things previously made, by thee, to
wit, who art a man made in a lower place, and set in a lower place: but
before that all these things were made, they were known by Him by whom
they were made, and that which He knew He made. Therefore in that Word
by which He made all things, before that they were made, were all
things; and after they have been made there are all things; but in one
way here, in another there, in one way in their own nature wherein they
have been made, in another in the art by which they have been made. Who
could explain this? We may endeavour: go ye with Idithun, and see.

<span id="ii.LXII-p93"></span>12. …For even the Lord saith, “Many things
I have to say to you, but ye cannot bear them now.” <span
id="fr_2437"></span>[2438](#fn_2437.md) What is therefore, “These two
things I have heard”? These two things which to you I am about to say
not of myself to you I say, but what things I have heard I say. “Once
hath God spoken:” One Word hath He, the Only-begotten God. In that Word
are all things, because by the Word were made all things. One Word hath
He, “in whom all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are
hidden.” <span id="fr_2438"></span>[2439](#fn_2438.md) One Word He hath,
“once hath God spoken.” “These two things,” which to you I am about to
say, these I have heard: not of myself I speak, not of myself I say: to
this belongeth the “I have heard.” <span
id="fr_2439"></span>[2440](#fn_2439.md) But the friend of the Bridegroom
standeth and heareth Him, that he may speak the truth. For he heareth
Him, lest by speaking a lie, of his own he should speak: <span
id="fr_2440"></span>[2441](#fn_2440.md) lest thou shouldest say, Who art
thou that sayest this thing to me? whence dost thou say this to me? I
have heard these two things, and I that speak to thee that I have heard
these two things, am one who also doth know that once God hath spoken.
Do not despise a hearer saying to thee certain two things for thee so
necessary; him, I say, that by leaping over the whole creation hath
attained unto the Only-begotten Word of God, where he hath learned that
“once God hath spoken.”

<span id="ii.LXII-p98"></span>13. Let him therefore now say certain two
things. For greatly to us belong these two things. “For power is of God,
and to Thee, O Lord, is mercy.” Are these the two things, power and
mercy? These two evidently: perceive ye the power of God, perceive ye
the mercy of God. In these two things are contained nearly all the
Scriptures. Because of these two things are the Prophets, because of
these two, the Patriarchs, because of these the Law, because of these
Himself our Lord Jesus Christ, because of these the Apostles, because of
these all the preaching and spreading of the word of God in the Church,
because of these two, because of the power of God, and His mercy. His
power fear ye, His mercy love ye. Neither so on His mercy rely, as that
His power ye despise: nor so the power fear ye, as that of mercy ye
despair. With Him is power, with Him mercy. This man He humbleth, and
that man He exalteth: <span id="fr_2441"></span>[2442](#fn_2441.md) this
man He humbleth with power, that man He exalteth in mercy. “For if God,
willing to show wrath and to prove His power, hath in much patience
borne with the vessels of wrath, which have been perfected unto
perdition” <span id="fr_2442"></span>[2443](#fn_2442.md) —thou hast heard
of power: inquire for mercy—“and that He might make known,” He saith,
“His riches unto the vessels of mercy.” It belongeth therefore to His
power to condemn unjust men. And to Him who would say, What hast thou
done? “For thou, O man, who art thou that should make answer to
God?” <span id="fr_2443"></span>[2444](#fn_2443.md) Fear therefore and
tremble at His power: but hope for His mercy. The devil is a sort of
power; ofttimes however he wisheth to hurt, and is not <span
id="page_257">p. 257</span> <span id="ii.LXII-Page_257"></span>able,
because that power is under power. For if the devil could hurt as much
as he would; no one of just men would remain, nor could any one of the
faithful be on earth. The same through his vessels smiteth against, as
it were, a wall bowed down: but he only smiteth against, so far as he
receiveth power. But in order that the wall may not fall, the Lord will
support: for He that giveth power to the tempter, doth Himself to the
tempted extend mercy. For according to measure the devil is permitted to
tempt. And, “Thou wilt give us to drink in tears in a measure.” <span
id="fr_2444"></span>[2445](#fn_2444.md) Do not therefore fear the tempter
permitted to do somewhat: for thou hast a most merciful Saviour. So much
he is permitted to tempt as is profitable for thee, that thou mayest be
exercised, mayest be proved; in order that by thyself thou mayest be
found out, that knowest not thyself. For where, or from whence, ought we
to be secure, except by this power and mercy of God? After that
Apostolic saying, “Faithful is God, that doth not suffer you to be
tempted above that which ye are able.” <span
id="fr_2445"></span>[2446](#fn_2445.md) …Fear not the enemy: so much he
doeth as he hath received power to do, Him fear thou that hath the chief
power: Him fear, that doeth as much as He willeth, and that doeth
nothing unjustly, and whatever He shall have done, is just. We might
suppose something or other to be unjust: inasmuch as God hath done it,
believe it to be just.

<span id="ii.LXII-p104"></span>14. Therefore, thou sayest, if any one
slay an innocent man, doeth he justly or unjustly? Unjustly certainly.
Wherefore doth God permit this?…The counsel of God to tell to thee, O
man, I am not able: this thing however I say, both that the man hath
done unjustly that hath slain an innocent person, and that it would not
have been done unless God permitted it: and though the man hath done
unjustly, yet God hath not unjustly permitted this. Let the reason lie
concealed in that person whoever it be, for whose sake thou art moved,
whose innocence doth much move thee. For to thee speedily I might make
answer. He would not have been slain unless he were guilty: but thou
thinkest him innocent. I might speedily say this to thee. For thou
couldest not examine his heart, sift his deeds, weigh his thoughts, so
that thou couldest say to me, unjustly he was slain. I might easily
therefore make answer: but there is forced upon my view a certain Just
One, without dispute just, without doubt just, who had no sin, slain by
sinners, betrayed by a sinner; Himself Christ the Lord, of whom we
cannot say that He hath any iniquity, for “those things which He robbed
not He paid,” <span id="fr_2446"></span>[2447](#fn_2446.md) is made an
objection to my answer. And why should I speak of Christ? “With thee I
am dealing,” thou sayest. And I with thee. About Him thou proposest a
question, about Him I am solving the question. For therein the counsel
of God we know, which except by His own revealing we should not know: so
that when thou shalt have found out that counsel of God, whereby He hath
permitted His innocent Son to be slain by unjust men, and such a counsel
as pleaseth thee, and such a counsel as cannot displease thee, if thou
art just, thou mayest believe that in other things also by His counsel
God doeth the same, but it escaped thee. Ah! brethren, need there was of
the blood of a just one to blot out the handwriting of sins; need there
was of an example of patience, of an example of humility; need there was
of the Sign of the Cross to beat down the devil and his angels; need for
us there was of the Passion of our Lord; for by the Passion of the Lord
redeemed hath been the world. How many good things hath the Passion of
the Lord done! And yet the Passion of this Just One would not have been,
unless unrighteous men had slain the Lord. What then? is this good thing
which to us hath been granted by the Lord’s Passion to be ascribed to
the unjust slayers of Christ? Far be it. They willed, God permitted.
They guilty would have been, even if only they had willed it: but God
would not have permitted it, unless just it had been.…Accordingly, my
brethren, both Judas the foul traitor to Christ, and the persecutors of
Christ, malignant all, ungodly all, unjust all, are to be condemned all:
and nevertheless the Father His own proper Son hath not spared, but for
the sake of us all He hath delivered Him up. <span
id="fr_2447"></span>[2448](#fn_2447.md) Order if thou art able; distinguish
if thou art able (these things): render to God thy vows, which thy lips
have uttered: see what the unjust hath here done, what the Just One. The
one hath willed, the Other hath permitted: the one unjustly hath willed,
the Other justly hath permitted. Let unjust will be condemned, just
permission be glorified. For what evil thing hath befallen Christ, in
that Christ hath died? Both evil were they that evil willed to do, and
yet nothing of evil did He suffer on whom they did it. Slain was mortal
flesh, slaying death by death, giving a lesson of patience, sending
before an example of Resurrection. How great good things of the Just One
were wrought by the evil things of the unjust! This is the great
mystery <span id="fr_2448"></span>[2449](#fn_2448.md) of God: that even a
good thing which thou doest He hath Himself given it to thee, and by thy
evil He doeth good Himself. Do not therefore wonder, God permitteth, and
in judgment permitteth: He permitteth, and in measure, number, weight,
He permitteth. With Him is not iniquity: <span
id="fr_2449"></span>[2450](#fn_2449.md) do <span id="page_258">p.
258</span> <span id="ii.LXII-Page_258"></span>thou only belong to Him;
on Himself thy hope set thou, let Himself be thy Helper, thy Salvation:
in Him be there the fortified place, the tower of strength, <span
id="fr_2450"></span>[2451](#fn_2450.md) thy refuge let Himself be, and He
will not suffer thee to be tempted above that which thou art able to
bear, but will make with the temptation also an escape, that thou mayest
be able to support it: <span id="fr_2451"></span>[2452](#fn_2451.md) so
that His suffering thee to bear temptation, be His power; His suffering
not any more on thee to be done than thou art able to bear, be His
mercy: “for power is of God, and to Thee, O Lord, is mercy, because Thou
wilt render to each one after his works.”

<span id="ii.LXII-p111"></span>15. That thirst of the Church, would fain
drink up that man also whom ye see. <span
id="fr_2452"></span>[2453](#fn_2452.md) At the same time also, in order
that ye may know how many in the mixed multitude of Christians with
their mouth do bless, and in their heart curse, this man having been a
Christian and a believer returneth as a penitent, and being terrified by
the power of the Lord, turneth him to the mercy of the Lord. For having
been led astray by the enemy when he was a believer, long time he hath
been an astrologer, led astray, leading astray, deceived, deceiving, he
hath allured, hath beguiled, many lies he hath spoken against God, That
hath given to men power of doing that which is good, and of not doing
that which is evil. He used to say, that one’s own will did not
adultery, but Venus; one’s own will did not manslaying, but Mars; and
God did not what is just, but Jupiter; and many other blasphemous
things, and not light ones. From how many Christians do ye think he hath
pocketed money? How many from him have bought a lie, to whom we used to
say, “Sons of men, how long are ye dull of heart, wherefore love ye
vanity, and seek a lie”? <span id="fr_2453"></span>[2454](#fn_2453.md) Now,
as of him must be believed, he hath shuddered at his lie, and being the
allurer of many men, he hath perceived at length that by the devil he
hath himself been allured, and he turneth to God a penitent. We think,
brethren, that because of great fear of heart it hath come to pass. For
what must we say? If out of a heathen an astrologer were converted,
great indeed would be the joy: but nevertheless it might appear, that,
if he had been converted, he was desiring the clerical office in the
Church. A penitent he is, he seeketh not anything save mercy alone. He
must be recommended therefore both to your eyes and hearts. Him whom ye
see in hearts love ye, with eyes guard ye. See ye him, mark ye him, and
whithersoever he shall have gone his way, to the rest of the brethren
that now are not here, point him out: and such diligence is mercy; lest
that leader astray drag back <span id="fr_2454"></span>[2455](#fn_2454.md)
his heart and take it by storm. Guard ye him, let there not escape you
his conversation, his way: in order that by your testimony it may be
proved to us that truly to the Lord he hath been turned. For report will
not be silent about his life, when to you he is thus presented both to
be seen and to be pitied. Ye know in the Acts of the Apostles how it is
written, that many lost men, that is, men of such arts, and followers of
naughty doctrines, brought unto the Apostles all their books; and there
were burned so many volumes, that it was the writer’s task to make a
valuation of them, and write down the sum of the price. <span
id="fr_2455"></span>[2456](#fn_2455.md) This truly was for the glory of
God, in order that even such lost men might not be despaired of by Him
that knew how to seek that which had been lost. Therefore this man had
been lost, is now sought, found, <span
id="fr_2456"></span>[2457](#fn_2456.md) led hither, he bringeth with him
books to be burned, by which he had been to be burned, so that when
these have been thrown into the fire, he may himself pass over into a
place of refreshment. Know ye that he, brethren, once knocked at the
Church door before Easter: <span id="fr_2457"></span>[2458](#fn_2457.md)
for before Easter he began to ask of the Church Christ’s medicine. But
because the art wherein he had been practised is of such sort as that it
was suspected of lying and deceit, he was put off that he might not
tempt; at length however he was admitted, that he might not more
dangerously be tempted. Pray for him through Christ. Straightway
to-day’s prayer pour out for him to the Lord our God. For we know and
are sure, that your prayer effaceth all his impieties. The Lord be with
you.
