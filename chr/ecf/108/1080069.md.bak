<span id="ii.LIX.1-p1"></span> <span id="ii.LIX.1-p1.1"></span><span
class="c20"><span id="ii.LIX.1-p1.2"></span>Psalm LIX. <span
id="fr_2216"></span>[2217](#fn_2216.md) </span>

<span id="ii.LIX.1-p3"></span>The First Part.

<span id="ii.LIX.1-p4"></span>1. As the Scripture is wont to set
mysteries of the Psalms on the titles, and to deck the brow of a Psalm
with the high announcement of a Mystery, <span
id="fr_2217"></span>[2218](#fn_2217.md) in order that we that are about to
go in may know (when as it were upon the door-post we have read what
within is doing) either of whom the house is, or who is the owner of
that estate: so also in this Psalm there hath been written a title, of a
title. For it hath, “At the end, corrupt not for David himself unto the
inscription of the title.” This is that which I have spoken of, title of
Title. For what the inscription of this title is, which to be corrupted
he forbiddeth, the Gospel to us doth indicate. For when the Lord was
being crucified, a title by Pilate was inscribed and set, “King of the
Jews,” <span id="fr_2218"></span>[2219](#fn_2218.md) in three tongues,
Hebrew, Greek, and Latin: <span id="fr_2219"></span>[2220](#fn_2219.md)
which tongues in the whole world mostly do prevail.…Therefore “corrupt
not” is most proper and prophetic; since indeed even those Jews made
suggestion at that time to Pilate, and said, “Do not write King of the
Jews, but write, that Himself said that He was King of the Jews:” <span
id="fr_2220"></span>[2221](#fn_2220.md) for this title, say they, hath
established Him King over us. And Pilate, “What I have written, I have
written.” And there was fulfilled, “corrupt not.”

<span id="ii.LIX.1-p9"></span>2. Nor is this the only Psalm which hath
an inscription of such sort, that the Title be not corrupted. Several
Psalms thus are marked on the face, but however in all the Passion of
the Lord is foretold. Therefore here also let us perceive the Lord’s
Passion, and let there speak to us Christ, Head and Body. So always, or
nearly always, let us hear the words of Christ from the Psalm, as that
we look not only upon that Head, the one mediator between God and man,
the Man Christ Jesus. <span id="fr_2221"></span>[2222](#fn_2221.md) …But
let us think of Christ, Head and whole Body, a sort of entire Man. For
to us is said, “But ye are the Body of Christ and members,” <span
id="fr_2222"></span>[2223](#fn_2222.md) by the Apostle Paul. If therefore
He is Head, we Body; whole Christ is Head and Body. For sometimes thou
findest words which do not suit the Head, and unless thou shalt have
attached them to the Body, thy understanding will waver: again thou
findest words which are proper for the Body, and Christ nevertheless is
speaking. In that place we must have no fear lest a man be mistaken: for
quickly he proceedeth to adapt to the Head, that which he seeth is not
proper for the Body.…

<span id="ii.LIX.1-p12"></span>3. Let us hear, therefore, what
followeth: “When Saul sent and guarded his house in order that he might
kill him.” This though not to the Cross of the Lord, yet to the Passion
of the Lord doth belong. For Crucified was Christ, and dead, and buried.
That sepulchre was therefore as it were the house: to guard which the
government of the Jews sent, when guards were set to the sepulchre of
Christ. <span id="fr_2223"></span>[2224](#fn_2223.md) There is <span
id="page_237">p. 237</span> <span id="ii.LIX.1-Page_237"></span>indeed a
story in the Scripture of the Reigns, of the occasion when Saul sent to
guard the house in order that he might kill David. <span
id="fr_2224"></span>[2225](#fn_2224.md) …But in like manner as Saul
effected not his purpose of slaying David: so this could not the
government of the Jews effect, that the testimony of guards sleeping
should avail more than that of Apostles watching. For what were the
guards instructed to say? We give to you, they say, as much money as ye
please; and say ye, that while ye were sleeping there came His
disciples, and took Him away. Behold what sort of witnesses of falsehood
against truth and the Resurrection of Christ, His enemies, through Saul
figured, did produce. Enquire, O unbelief, of sleeping witnesses, let
them reply to thee of what was done in the tomb. Who, if they were
sleeping, whence knew it? If watching, wherefore detained they not the
thieves? Let him say therefore what followeth.

<span id="ii.LIX.1-p15"></span>4. “Deliver me from mine enemies, my God,
and from men rising up upon me, redeem Thou me” ([Psa.
59.1](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#001.md)<span
id="ii.LIX.1-p15.1"></span>). There hath been done this thing in the
flesh of Christ, it is being done in us also. For our enemies, to wit
the devil and his angels, cease not to rise up upon us every day, and to
wish to make sport of our weakness and our frailness, by deceptions, by
suggestions, by temptations, and by snares of whatsoever sort to
entangle us, while on earth we are still living. But let our voice watch
unto God, and cry out in the members of Christ, under the Head that is
in heaven, “Deliver me from mine enemies, my God, and from men rising up
upon me, redeem Thou me.”

<span id="ii.LIX.1-p16"></span>5. “Deliver me from men working iniquity,
and from men of bloods, save Thou me” ([Psa.
59.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#002.md)<span
id="ii.LIX.1-p16.1"></span>). They indeed were men of bloods, who slew
the Just One, in whom no guilt they found: they were men of bloods,
because when the foreigner washed his hands, and would have let go
Christ, they cried, “Crucify, Crucify:” <span
id="fr_2225"></span>[2226](#fn_2225.md) they were men of bloods, on whom
when there was being charged the crime of the blood of Christ, they made
answer, giving it to their posterity to drink, “His blood be upon us and
upon our sons.” <span id="fr_2226"></span>[2227](#fn_2226.md) But neither
against His Body did men of bloods cease to rise up; for even after the
Resurrection and Ascension of Christ, the Church suffered persecutions,
and she indeed first that grew out of the Jewish people, of which also
our Apostles were. There at first Stephen was stoned, <span
id="fr_2227"></span>[2228](#fn_2227.md) and received that of which he had
his name. For Stephanus doth signify a crown. Lowly stoned but highly
crowned. Secondly, among the Gentiles rose up kingdoms of Gentiles,
before that in them was fulfilled that which had been foretold, “There
shall adore Him all the kings of the earth, all nations shall serve
Him:” <span id="fr_2228"></span>[2229](#fn_2228.md) and there roared the
fierceness of that kingdom against the witnesses of Christ: there was
shed largely and frequently the blood of Martyrs: wherewith when it had
been shed, being as it were sown, the field of the Church more
productively put forth, and filled the whole world as we now behold.
From these therefore, men of bloods, is delivered Christ, not only Head,
but also Body. From men of bloods is delivered Christ, both from them
that have been, and from them that are, and from them that are to be;
there is delivered Christ, both He that hath gone before, and He that
is, and He that is to come. For Christ is the whole Body of Christ; and
whatsoever good Christians that now are, and that have been before us,
and that after us are to be, are an whole Christ, who is delivered from
men of bloods; nor is this voice void, “And from men of bloods save Thou
me.”

<span id="ii.LIX.1-p21"></span>6. “For behold they have hunted my
soul.…There have rushed upon me strong men” ([Psa.
59.3](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#003.md)<span
id="ii.LIX.1-p21.1"></span>). We must not however pass on from these
strong men: diligently we must trace who are the strong men rising up.
Strong men, upon whom but upon weak men, upon powerless men, upon men
not strong? And praised nevertheless are the weak men, and condemned are
the strong men. If it would be perceived who are strong men, at first
the devil himself the Lord hath called a strong man: “No one,” He saith,
“is able to go into the house of a strong man, and to carry off his
vessels, unless first he shall have bound the strong man.” <span
id="fr_2229"></span>[2230](#fn_2229.md) He hath bound therefore the strong
man with the chains of His dominion: and his vessels He hath carried
off, and His own vessels hath made them. For all unrighteous men were
vessels of the devil.…But there are among mankind certain strong men of
a blameable and damnable strength, that are confident indeed, but on
temporal felicity. That man doth not <span
id="fr_2230"></span>[2231](#fn_2230.md) seem to you to have been strong, of
whom now from the Gospel <span id="fr_2231"></span>[2232](#fn_2231.md) hath
been read: how his estate brought forth abundance of fruits, and he
being troubled, hit upon the design of rebuilding, so that, having
pulled down his old barns, he should construct new ones more capacious,
and, these having been finished, should say to his soul, “Thou hast many
good things, soul, feast, be merry, be filled.”…There are also other men
strong, not because of riches, not because of the powers of the body,
not because of any temporally pre-eminent power of station, but relying
on their righteousness. This sort of strong men must be guarded against,
feared, repulsed, not imitated: of men relying, I say, not on <span
id="page_238">p. 238</span> <span id="ii.LIX.1-Page_238"></span>body,
not on means, not on descent, not on honour; for all such things who
would not see to be temporal, fleeting, falling, flying? but relying on
their own righteousness.…“Wherefore,” say they, doth your Master eat
with publicans and sinners? <span id="fr_2232"></span>[2233](#fn_2232.md) O
ye strong men, to whom a Physician is not needful! This strength to
soundness belongeth not, but to insanity. For even than men frenzied
nothing can be stronger, more mighty they are than whole men: but by how
much greater their powers are, by so much nearer is their death. May God
therefore turn away from our imitation these strong men.…The same are
therefore the strong men, that assailed Christ, commending their own
justice. Hear ye these strong men: when certain men of Jerusalem were
speaking, having been sent by them to take Christ, and not daring to
take Him (because when he would, then was He taken, that truly was
strong): Why therefore, say they, “could ye not take Him?” And they made
answer, “No one of men did ever so speak as He.” And these strong men,
“Hath by any means any one of the Pharisees believed on Him, or any one
of the Scribes, but this people knowing not the Law?” <span
id="fr_2233"></span>[2234](#fn_2233.md) They preferred themselves to the
sick multitude, that was running to the Physician: whence but because
they were themselves strong? and what is worse, by their strength, all
the multitude also they brought over unto themselves, and slew the
Physician of all.…

<span id="ii.LIX.1-p27"></span>7. What next? “Neither iniquity is mine,
nor sin mine, O Lord” ([Psa. 59.4](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#004.md)<span
id="ii.LIX.1-p27.1"></span>). There have rushed on indeed strong men on
their own righteousness relying, they have rushed on, but sin in me they
have not found. For truly those strong men, that is, as it were
righteous men, on what account would they be able to persecute Christ,
unless it were as if a sinner? But, however, let them look to it how
strong they be, in the raging of fever not in the vigour of soundness:
let them look to it how strong they be, and how as though just against
an unrighteous man they have raged. <span
id="fr_2234"></span>[2235](#fn_2234.md) But, however, “neither iniquity is
mine, nor sin mine, O Lord. Without iniquity I did run, and I was
guided.” Those strong men therefore could not follow me running:
therefore a sinner they have deemed me, because my steps they have not
seen.

<span id="ii.LIX.1-p29"></span>8. “Without iniquity I did run, and was
guided; rise up to meet me, and see.” To God is said *this.* But why? If
He meet not, is He unable to see? It is just as if thou wast walking in
a road, and from afar by some one thou couldest not be recognised, thou
wouldest call to him and wouldest say, Meet me, and see how I am
walking; for when from afar thou espiest me, my steps thou art not able
to see. So also unless God were to meet, would He not see how without
iniquity he was guided, and how without sin he was running? This
interpretation indeed we can also accept, namely, “Rise up to meet me,”
as if “help me.” But that which he hath added, “and see,” must be
understood as, make it to be seen that I run, make it to be seen that I
am guided: according to that figure wherein this also hath been said to
Abraham, “Now I know that thou fearest God.” <span
id="fr_2235"></span>[2236](#fn_2235.md) God saith, “Now I know:” whence,
but because I have made thee to know? For unknown to himself every one
is before the questioning of temptation: just as of himself Peter <span
id="fr_2236"></span>[2237](#fn_2236.md) in his confidence was ignorant, and
by denying learned what kind of powers he had, in his very stumbling he
perceived that it was falsely he had been confident: he wept, and in
weeping he earned profitably to know what he was, and to be what he was
not. Therefore Abraham when tried, became known to himself: and it was
said by God, “Now I know,” that is, now I have made thee to know. In
like manner as glad is the day because it maketh men glad; and sad is
bitterness because it maketh sad one tasting thereof: so God’s seeing is
making to see. “Rise up, therefore,” he saith, “to meet me, and see”
([Psa. 59.5](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#005.md)<span
id="ii.LIX.1-p31.2"></span>). What is, “and see”? And help me, that is,
in those men, in order that they may see my course, may follow me; let
not that seem to them to be crooked which is straight, let not that seem
to them to be curved which keepeth the rule of truth.

<span id="ii.LIX.1-p32"></span>9. Something else I am admonished to say
in this place of the loftiness of our Head Himself: for He was made weak
even unto death, and He took on Him the weakness of flesh, in order that
the chickens of Jerusalem He might gather under His wings, like a hen
showing herself weak with her little ones. <span
id="fr_2237"></span>[2238](#fn_2237.md) For have we not observed this thing
in some bird at some time or other, even in those which build nests
before our eyes, as the house-sparrows, as swallows, so to speak, our
annual guests, as storks, as various sorts of birds, which before our
eyes build nests, and hatch eggs, feed chickens, as the very doves which
daily we see; and some bird to become weak with her chickens, have we
not known, have we not looked upon, have we not seen? In what way doth a
hen experience this weakness? Surely a known fact I am speaking of,
which in our sight is daily taking place. How her voice groweth hoarse,
how her whole body is made languid? The wings droop, the feathers are
<span id="page_239">p. 239</span> <span
id="ii.LIX.1-Page_239"></span>loosened, and thou seest around the
chickens some sick thing, and this is maternal love which is found as
weakness. Why was it therefore, but for this reason, that the Lord
willed to be as a Hen, saying in the Holy Scripture, “Jerusalem,
Jerusalem, how often have I willed to gather thy sons, even as a hen her
chickens under her wings, and thou hast not been willing.” But He hath
gathered all nations, like as a hen her chickens.…

<span id="ii.LIX.1-p34"></span>10. “And Thou, Lord God of virtues, God
of Israel.” Thou God of Israel, that art thought to be but God of one
nation, which worshippeth Thee, when all nations worship idols, Thou God
of Israel, “Give heed unto the visiting all nations.” Fulfilled be that
prophecy wherein Isaiah in Thy person speaketh to Thy Church, Thy holy
City, that barren one of whom many more are the sons of Her forsaken
than of her that hath a husband. To Her indeed hath been said, “Rejoice,
thou barren, that bearest not,” <span
id="fr_2238"></span>[2239](#fn_2238.md) etc., more than of the Jewish
nation which hath a Husband, which hath received the Law, more than of
that nation which had a visible king. For thy king is hidden, and more
sons to thee there are by a hidden Bridegroom.…The Prophet addeth,
“Enlarge the place of Thy tabernacle, and Thy <span
id="fr_2239"></span>[2240](#fn_2239.md) courts fix thou: there is no cause
for thee to spare, extend further thy cords, and strong stakes set thou
again and again on the right and on the left.” <span
id="fr_2240"></span>[2241](#fn_2240.md) Upon the right keep good men, on
the left keep evil men, <span id="fr_2241"></span>[2242](#fn_2241.md) until
there come the fan: <span id="fr_2242"></span>[2243](#fn_2242.md) occupy
nevertheless all nations; bidden to the marriage be good men and evil
men, filled be the marriage with guests; <span
id="fr_2243"></span>[2244](#fn_2243.md) it is the office of servants to
bid, of the Lord to sever. “Cities which had been forsaken Thou shall
inhabit:” <span id="fr_2244"></span>[2245](#fn_2244.md) forsaken of God,
forsaken of Prophets, forsaken of Apostles, forsaken of the Gospel, full
of demons. For Thou shalt prevail; and blush not because abominable Thou
hast been. Therefore though there have risen up upon thee strong men,
blush not: when against the name of Christ laws were enacted, when
ignominy and infamy it was to be a Christian. “Blush not because
abominable Thou hast been: for confusion for everlasting Thou shalt
forget, of the ignominy of Thy widowhood Thou shall not be mindful.”…

<span id="ii.LIX.1-p42"></span>11. “Have not pity upon all men that work
iniquity.” Here evidently He is terrifying. Whom would He not terrify?
What man falling back upon his own conscience would not tremble? Which
even if to itself it is conscious of godliness, strange if it be not in
some sort conscious of iniquity. For whosoever doeth sin, also doeth
iniquity. <span id="fr_2245"></span>[2246](#fn_2245.md) “For if Thou shalt
have marked iniquities, O Lord, what man shall abide it?” <span
id="fr_2246"></span>[2247](#fn_2246.md) And nevertheless a true saying it
is, and not said to no purpose, and neither is nor will it be possible
to be void, “Have not pity upon all men that work iniquity.” But He had
pity even upon Paul, who at first as Saul wrought iniquity. For what
good thing did he, whence he might deserve of God? Did he not hate His
Saints unto death? <span id="fr_2247"></span>[2248](#fn_2247.md) did he not
bear letters from the chief of the priests, to the end that wheresoever
he might find Christians, to punishment he should hurry them? When bent
upon this, when thither proceeding, breathing and panting slaughter, as
the Scripture testified of him, was he not from Heaven with a mighty
voice summoned, thrown down, raised up; blinded, lightened; slain, made
alive; destroyed, restored? In return for what merit? Let us say
nothing; himself rather let us hear: “I that before have been,” he
saith, “a blasphemer, and persecutor; and injurious, but mercy I have
obtained.” <span id="fr_2248"></span>[2249](#fn_2248.md) Surely “Thou
wouldest not have pity upon all men that work iniquity:” this in two
ways may be understood: either that in fact not any sins doth God leave
unpunished; or that there is a sort of iniquity, on the workers whereof
God hath indeed no pity.

<span id="ii.LIX.1-p47"></span>12. All iniquity, be it little or great,
punished must needs be, either by man himself repenting, or by God
avenging. For even he that repenteth punisheth himself. Therefore,
brethren, let us punish our own sins, if we seek the mercy of God. God
cannot have mercy on all men working iniquity as if pandering to sins,
or not rooting out sins. In a word, either thou punishest, or He
punisheth.…

<span id="ii.LIX.1-p48"></span>13. But let us see now another way in
which this sentence may be understood. There is a certain iniquity, on
the worker whereof it cannot be that God have mercy. Ye enquire,
perchance, what that is? It is the defending of sins. When a man
defendeth his sins, great iniquity he worketh: that thing he is
defending which God hateth. And see how perversely, how iniquitously.
Whatever of good he hath done, to himself he would have it to be
ascribed; whatever of evil, to God. For in this manner men defend sins
in the person of God, which is a worse sin.…Therefore thou defendest thy
sin in such sort, that thou layest blame on God. So the guilty is
excused, so that the Judge may be charged. However on men working
iniquity God hath no pity at all.

<span id="ii.LIX.1-p49"></span>14. “Let them be converted at the
evening” ([Psa. 59.6](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#006.md)<span
id="ii.LIX.1-p49.1"></span>). Of certain men he is speaking that were
once workers of iniquity, and once darkness, being converted in the
evening. What is, “in the evening”? Afterward. What is “at the even<span
id="page_240">p. 240</span> <span id="ii.LIX.1-Page_240"></span>ing”?
Later. For before, before that they crucified Christ, they ought to have
acknowledged their Physician. Wherefore, when He had been
crucified—rising again, into Heaven ascending—after that He sent His
Holy Spirit, wherewith were fulfilled they that were in one house, and
they began to speak with the tongues of all nations, there feared the
crucifiers of Christ; they were pricked through with their consciences,
they besought counsel of safety from the Apostles, they heard, “Repent,
and be baptized each one of you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
and your sins shall be remitted unto you.” <span
id="fr_2249"></span>[2250](#fn_2249.md) After the slaying of Christ, after
the shedding of the blood of Christ, remitted are your sins.…“Let these
be converted,” therefore, they also “at evening.” Let them yearn for the
grace of God, perceive themselves to be sinners; let those strong men be
made weak, those rich men be made poor, those just men acknowledge
themselves sinners, those lions be made dogs. “Let them be converted at
evening, and suffer hunger as dogs. And they shall go around the city.”
What city? That world, which in certain places the Scripture calleth
“the city of standing round:” <span id="fr_2250"></span>[2251](#fn_2250.md)
that is, because in all nations everywhere the world had encompassed the
one nation of Jews, where such words were being spoken, and it was
called “the city of standing round.” Around this city shall go those
men, now having become hungry dogs. In what manner shall they go around?
By preaching. Saul out of a wolf was made a dog at evening, that is,
being late converted by the crumbs of his Lord, in His grace he ran, and
went around the city.  <span id="fr_2251"></span>[2252](#fn_2251.md)

<span id="ii.LIX.1-p53"></span>15. “Behold, themselves shall speak in
their mouth, and a sword is on the lips of them” ([Psa.
59.7](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#007.md)<span
id="ii.LIX.1-p53.1"></span>). Here is that sword twice whetted, whereof
the Apostle saith, “And the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of
God.” <span id="fr_2252"></span>[2253](#fn_2252.md) Wherefore twice
whetted? Wherefore, but because smiting out of both Testaments? With
this sword were slain those whereof it was said to Peter, “Slay, and
eat.” <span id="fr_2253"></span>[2254](#fn_2253.md) “And a sword is on the
lips of them. For who hath heard?” They all speak in their mouth, “Who
hath heard?” That is, they shall be wroth with men that are slow to
believe. They that a little before were even themselves unwilling to
believe, do feel disgust from men not believing. And truly, brethren, so
it is. Thou seest a man slow before he is made a Christian; thou criest
to him daily, hardly he is converted: suppose him to be converted, and
then he would have all men to be Christians, and wondereth that not yet
they are. It hath chanced out to him at evening to have been converted:
but because he hath been made hungering like a dog, he hath also on his
lips a sword; he saith, “Who hath heard?” What is, “Who hath heard?”
“Who hath believed our hearing, and to whom hath the arm of the Lord
been revealed?” <span id="fr_2254"></span>[2255](#fn_2254.md) “For who hath
heard?” The Jews believe not: they have turned them to the nations, and
have preached. The Jews did not believe; and nevertheless through
believing Jews the Gospel went around the city, and they said, “For who
hath heard?” “And Thou, Lord, shall deride them” ([Psa.
59.8](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#008.md)<span
id="ii.LIX.1-p56.2"></span>). All nations are to be Christian, and ye
say, “Who hath heard?” What is, “shall deride them”? “As nothing Thou
shalt esteem all nations.” Nothing for Thee it shall be; because a most
easy thing it will be for all nations to believe in Thee.

<span id="ii.LIX.1-p57"></span>16. “My strength to Thee I will keep”
([Psa. 59.9](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#009.md)<span
id="ii.LIX.1-p57.1"></span>). For those strong men have fallen for this
reason; because their strength to Thee they have not kept: that is, they
that upon me have risen up and rushed, on themselves have relied. But I
“my strength to Thee will keep:” because if I withdraw, I fall; if I
draw near, stronger I am made. For see, brethren, what there is in a
human soul. It hath not of itself light, hath not of itself powers: but
all that is fair in a soul, is virtue and wisdom: but it neither is wise
for itself, nor strong for itself, nor itself is light to itself, nor
itself is virtue to itself. There is a certain origin and fountain of
virtue, there is a certain root of wisdom, there is a certain, so to
speak, if this also must be said, region of unchangeable truth: from
this the soul withdrawing is made dark, drawing near is made light.
 <span id="fr_2255"></span>[2256](#fn_2255.md) “Draw near to Him, and be
made light:” because by withdrawing ye are made dark. Therefore, “my
strength, I will keep to Thee:” not from Thee will I withdraw, not on
myself will I rely. “My strength, to Thee I will keep: because, O God,
my lifter up <span id="fr_2256"></span>[2257](#fn_2256.md) Thou art.” For
where was I, and where am I? Whence hast Thou taken me up? What
iniquities of mine hast Thou remitted? Where was I lying? To what have I
been raised up? I ought to have remembered these things: because in
another Psalm is said, “For my father and my mother have forsaken me,
but the Lord hath taken me unto Him.” <span
id="fr_2257"></span>[2258](#fn_2257.md)

<span id="ii.LIX.1-p61"></span>17. “My God, the mercy of Him shall <span
id="fr_2258"></span>[2259](#fn_2258.md) come before me” ([Psa.
59.10](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#010.md)<span
id="ii.LIX.1-p62.1"></span>). Behold what is, “My strength, to Thee I
will keep:” on myself I will in no ways at all rely. For what good thing
have I brought, that thou shouldest have mercy on me, and shouldest
justify me? What in me hast Thou found, save sins alone? Of Thine there
is nothing else but the nature which Thou <span id="page_241">p.
241</span> <span id="ii.LIX.1-Page_241"></span>hast created: the other
things are mine own evil things which Thou hast blotted out. I have not
first risen up to Thee, but to awake me Thou hast come: for “His mercy
shall come before me.” Before that anything of good I shall do, “His
mercy shall come before me.” What answer here shall the unhappy Pelagius
make? “My God hath shown to me among mine enemies” ([Psa.
59.11](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#011.md)<span
id="ii.LIX.1-p62.2"></span>). How great mercy He hath put forth
concerning me, among mine enemies He hath showed. Let one gathered
compare himself with men forsaken, and one elect with men rejected: let
the vessel of mercy compare itself with the vessels of wrath; and let it
see how out of one lump God hath made one vessel unto honour, another
unto dishonour.

<span id="ii.LIX.1-p63"></span>“For so God, willing to show wrath, and
to manifest His power, hath brought in, in much patience, the vessels of
wrath, which have been perfected unto perdition.” <span
id="fr_2259"></span>[2260](#fn_2259.md) And wherefore this? “In order that
He might make known His riches upon the vessels of mercy.” If therefore
vessels of wrath He hath brought in, wherein He might make known His
riches upon the vessels of mercy, most rightly hath been said, “His
mercy shall come before me: My God hath showed to me among mine
enemies:” that is however great mercy He hath had concerning me, to me
He hath showed it among these men concerning whom He hath not had mercy.
For unless the debtor be in suspense, he is less grateful to him by whom
the debt hath been forgiven. “My God hath showed to me among mine
enemies.”

<span id="ii.LIX.1-p65"></span>18. But of the enemies themselves what?
“Slay them not, lest sometime they forget Thy law.” He is making request
for his enemies, he is fulfilling the commandment.…Slay not them of whom
the sins Thou slayest. But what is it to be slain? To forget the law of
the Lord. It is real death, to go into the pit of sin; this indeed may
be also understood of the Jews. Why of the Jews, “Slay not them, lest
sometime they forget Thy law”? Those very enemies of mine, that have
slain me, do not Thou slay. Let the nation of the Jews remain: certes
conquered it hath been by the Romans, certes effaced is the city of
them, Jews are not admitted into their city, and yet Jews there are. For
all those provinces by the Romans have been subjugated. Who now can
distinguish the nations in the Roman empire the one from the other,
inasmuch as all have become Romans and all are called Romans? The Jews
nevertheless remain with a mark; nor in such sort conquered have they
been, as that by the conquerors they have been swallowed up. Not without
reason is there that Cain, on whom, when he had slain his brother, God
set a mark in order that no one should slay him. <span
id="fr_2260"></span>[2261](#fn_2260.md) This is the mark which the Jews
have: they hold fast by the remnant of their law, they are circumcised,
they keep Sabbaths, they sacrifice the Passover; they eat unleavened
bread. These are therefore Jews, they have not been slain, they are
necessary to believing nations. Why so? In order that He may show to us
among our enemies His mercy. “My God hath shown to me in mine enemies.”
He showeth His mercy to the wild-olive grafted on branches that have
been cut off because of pride. Behold where they lie, that were proud,
behold where thou hast been grafted, that didst lie: and be not thou
proud, lest thou shouldest deserve to be cut off.

<span id="ii.LIX.1-p67"></span>19. “Scatter them abroad in Thy virtue”
([Psa. 59.11](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#011.md)<span
id="ii.LIX.1-p67.1"></span>). Now this thing hath been done: throughout
all nations there have been scattered abroad the Jews, witnesses of
their own iniquity and our truth. They have themselves writings, out of
which hath been prophesied Christ, and we hold Christ. And if sometime
perchance any heathen man shall have doubted, when we have told him the
prophecies of Christ, at the clearness whereof he is amazed, and
wondering hath supposed that they were written by ourselves, then out of
the copies of the Jews we prove, how this thing so long time before had
been foretold. See after what sort by means of our enemies we confound
other enemies. “Scatter them abroad in Thy virtue:” take away from them
“virtue,” take away from them their strength. “And bring them down, my
protector, O Lord.” “The transgressions of their mouth, the discourse of
their lips: and let them be taken in their pride: and out of cursing and
lying shall be declared consummations, in the anger of consummation, and
they shall not be” ([Psa. 59.12](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#012.md)<span
id="ii.LIX.1-p67.2"></span>). Obscure words these are, and I fear lest
they be not well instilled.…
