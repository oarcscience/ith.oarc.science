<span id="ii.CXXI-p1"></span> <span id="ii.CXXI-p1.1"></span><span
class="c20"><span id="ii.CXXI-p1.2"></span>Psalm CXXI. <span
id="fr_5405"></span>[5406](#fn_5405.md) </span>

<span id="ii.CXXI-p3"></span>1. …Let them “lift up their eyes to the
hills whence cometh their help” ([Psa.
121.1](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#001)<span id="ii.CXXI-p3.1"></span>.md).
What meaneth, The hills have been lightened? The San of righteousness
hath already risen, the Gospel hath been already preached by the
Apostles, the Scriptures have been preached, all the mysteries have been
laid open, the veil hath been rent, the secret place of the temple hath
been revealed: let them now at length lift their eyes up to the hills,
whence their help cometh…“Of His fulness have all we received,” <span
id="fr_5406"></span>[5407](#fn_5406.md) he saith. Thy help therefore is
from Him, of whose fulness the hills received, not from the hills; <span
id="fr_5407"></span>[5408](#fn_5407.md) towards which, <span
id="fr_5408"></span>[5409](#fn_5408.md) nevertheless, save thou lift thine
eyes through the Scriptures, thou wilt not approach, so as to be lighted
by Him. <span id="fr_5409"></span>[5410](#fn_5409.md)

<span id="ii.CXXI-p8"></span>2. Sing therefore what followeth; if thou
wish to hear how thou mayest most securely set thy feet on the steps, so
that thou mayest not be fatigued in that ascent, nor stumble and fall:
pray in these words: “Suffer not my foot to be moved!” ([Psa.
121.3](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#003)<span id="ii.CXXI-p8.1"></span>.md).
Whereby are feet moved; whereby was the foot of him who was in Paradise
moved? But first consider whereby the feet of him who was among the
Angels were moved: who when his feet were moved fell, and from an Angel
became a devil: for when his feet were moved he fell. Seek whereby he
fell: he fell through pride. Nothing then moveth the feet, save pride:
nothing moveth the feet to a fall, save pride. Charity moveth them to
walk and to improve and to ascend; pride moveth them to fall…Rightly
therefore the Psalmist, hearing how he may ascend and may not fall,
prayeth unto God that he may profit from the vale of misery, and may not
fail in the swelling of pride, in these words, “Suffer not my feet to be
moved!” And He replieth unto him, “Let him that keepeth thee not sleep.”
Attend, my beloved. It is as if one thought were expressed in two
sentences; the man while ascending and singing “the song of degrees,”
saith, “Suffer not my foot to be moved:” and it is as if God answered,
Thou sayest unto Me, Let not my feet be moved: say also, “Let Him that
keepeth thee not sleep,” and thy foot shall not be moved.

<span id="ii.CXXI-p9"></span>3. Choose for thyself Him, who will neither
sleep nor slumber, and thy foot shall not be moved. God is never asleep:
if thou dost wish to have a keeper who never sleepeth, choose God for
thy keeper. “Suffer not my feet to be moved,” thou sayest: well, very
well: but He also saith unto thee, “Let not him that keepeth thee
slumber.” Thou perhaps wast about to turn thyself unto men as thy
keepers, and to say, whom shall I find who will not sleep? what man will
not slumber? whom do I find? whither shall I go? whither shall I return?
The Psalmist telleth thee: “He that keepeth Israel, shall neither
slumber nor sleep” ([Psa. 121.4](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#004.md)<span
id="ii.CXXI-p9.1"></span>). Dost thou wish to have a keeper who neither
slumbereth nor sleepeth? Behold, “He that keepeth Israel shall neither
slumber nor sleep:” for Christ keepeth Israel. Be thou then Israel. What
meaneth Israel? It is interpreted, Seeing God. And how is God seen?
First by faith: afterwards by sight. If thou canst not as yet see Him by
sight, see Him by faith…Who is there, who will neither slumber nor
sleep? when thou seekest among men, thou art deceived; thou wilt never
find one. Trust not then in any man: every man slumbereth, and will
sleep. When doth he slumber? When he beareth the flesh of weakness. When
will he sleep? When he is dead. Trust not then in man. A mortal may
slumber, he sleepeth in death. Seek not a keeper among men.

<span id="ii.CXXI-p10"></span>4. And who, thou askest, shall help me,
save He who slumbereth not, nor sleepeth? Hear what followeth: “The Lord
Himself is thy keeper” ([Psa.
121.5](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#005.md)<span
id="ii.CXXI-p10.1"></span>). It is not therefore man, that slumbereth
and sleepeth, but the Lord, that <span id="page_592">p. 592</span> <span
id="ii.CXXI-Page_592"></span>keepeth thee. How doth He keep thee? “The
Lord is thy defence upon the hand of thy right hand.”…It seemeth to me
to have a hidden sense: otherwise he would have simply said, without
qualification, “The Lord will keep thee,” without adding, “on thy right
hand.” For how? Doth God keep our right hand, and not our left? Did He
not create the whole of us? Did not He who made our right hand, make our
left hand also? Finally, if it pleased Him to speak of the right hand
alone, why said He, “on the hand of thy right hand,” and not at once
“upon thy right hand”? Why should He say this, unless He were keeping
somewhat here hidden for us to arrive at by knocking? For He would
either say, “The Lord shall keep thee,” and add no more; or if He would
add the right hand, “The Lord shall keep thee upon thy right hand;” or
at least, as He added “hand,” He would say, “The Lord shall keep thee
upon thy hand, even thy right hand,” <span
id="fr_5410"></span>[5411](#fn_5410.md) not “upon the hand of thy right
hand.”…

<span id="ii.CXXI-p12"></span>5. I ask you, how ye interpret what is
said in the Gospel, “Let not your left hand know what your right hand
doeth”? <span id="fr_5411"></span>[5412](#fn_5411.md) For if ye understand
this, ye will discover what is your right hand, and what is your left:
at the same time ye will also understand that God made both hands, the
left and the right; yet the left ought not to know what the right doeth.
By our left hand is meant all that we have in a temporal way; by our
right hand is meant, whatever our Lord promiseth us that is immutable
and eternal. But if He who will give everlasting life, Himself also
consoleth our present life by these temporal blessings, He hath Himself
made our right hand and our left…

<span id="ii.CXXI-p14"></span>6. Let us now come to this verse of the
Psalm: “The Lord is thy defence upon the hand of thy right hand” ([Psa.
121.5](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#005.md)<span
id="ii.CXXI-p14.1"></span>). By hand he meaneth power. How do we prove
this? Because the power of God also is styled the hand of God…Whereof
John saith, “He gave unto them power to become the sons of God.” <span
id="fr_5412"></span>[5413](#fn_5412.md) Whence hast thou received this
power? “To them,” he saith, “that believe in His Name.” If then thou
believest, this very power is given thee, to be among the sons of God.
But to be among the sons of God, is to belong to the right hand. Thy
faith therefore is the hand of thy right hand: that is, the power that
is given thee, to be among the sons of God, is the hand of thy right
hand…

<span id="ii.CXXI-p16"></span>7. “May the Lord shield thee upon the hand
of thy right hand” ([Psa. 121.6](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#006.md)<span
id="ii.CXXI-p16.1"></span>). I have said, and I believe ye have
recognised it. For had ye not recognised it, and that from the
Scriptures, ye would not signify your understanding of it by your
voices. <span id="fr_5413"></span>[5414](#fn_5413.md) Since then ye have
understood, brethren, consider what followeth; wherefore the Lord
shieldeth thee “upon the hand of thy right hand,” that is, in thy faith,
wherein we have received “power to become the sons of God,” and to be on
His right hand: wherefore should God shield us? On account of offences.
Whence come offences? Offences are to be feared from two quarters, for
there are two precepts upon which the whole Law hangeth and the
Prophets, the love of God and of our neighbour. <span
id="fr_5414"></span>[5415](#fn_5414.md) The Church is loved for the sake of
our neighbour, but God for the sake of God. Of God, is understood the
sun figuratively: of the Church, is understood the moon figuratively.
Whoever can err, so as to think otherwise of God than he ought,
believing not the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost to be of one
Substance, has been deceived by the cunning of heretics, chiefly of the
Arians. If he hath believed anything less in the Son or in the Holy
Spirit than in the Father, he hath suffered an offence in God; he is
scorched by the sun. Whoever again believeth that the Church existeth in
one province only, <span id="fr_5415"></span>[5416](#fn_5415.md) and not
that she is diffused over the whole world, and whoso believeth them that
say, “Lo here,” and “Lo there, is Christ,” <span
id="fr_5416"></span>[5417](#fn_5416.md) as ye but now heard when the Gospel
was being read; since He who gave so great a price, purchased the whole
world: he is offended, so to speak, in his neighbour, and is burnt by
the moon. Whoever therefore erreth in the very Substance of Truth, is
burnt by the sun, and is burnt through the day; because he erreth in
Wisdom itself…God therefore hath made one sun, which riseth upon the
good and the evil, that sun which the good and the evil see; but that
Sun is another one, not created, not born, through whom all things were
made; <span id="fr_5417"></span>[5418](#fn_5417.md) where is the
intelligence of the Immutable Truth: of this the ungodly say, “the Sun
rose not upon us.” <span id="fr_5418"></span>[5419](#fn_5418.md) Whosoever
erreth not in Wisdom itself, is not burnt by the sun. Whosoever erreth
not in the Church, and in the Lord’s Flesh, and in those things which
were done for us in time, is not burnt by the moon. But every man
although he believeth in Christ, erreth either in this or that respect,
unless what is here prayed for, “The Lord is thy defence upon the hand
of <span id="page_593">p. 593</span> <span
id="ii.CXXI-Page_593"></span>thy right hand,” is realized in him. He
goeth on to say, “So that the sun shall not burn thee by day, nor the
moon by night” ([Psa. 121.6](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#006.md)<span
id="ii.CXXI-p22.3"></span>). Thy defence, therefore, is upon the hand of
thy right hand for this reason, that the sun may not burn thee by day,
nor the moon by night. Understand hence, brethren, that it is spoken
figuratively. For, in truth, if we think of the visible sun, it burneth
by day: doth the moon burn by night? But what is burning? Offence. Hear
the Apostle’s words: “Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended,
and I burn not?” <span id="fr_5419"></span>[5420](#fn_5419.md)

<span id="ii.CXXI-p24"></span>8. “For the Lord shall preserve thee from
all evil” ([Psa. 121.7](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#007.md)<span
id="ii.CXXI-p24.1"></span>). From offences in the sun, from offences in
the moon, from all evil shall He preserve thee, who is thy defence upon
the hand of thy right hand, who will not sleep nor slumber. And for what
reason? Because we are amid temptations: “The Lord shall preserve thee
from all evil. The Lord preserve thy soul:” even thy very soul. “The
Lord preserve thy going out and thy coming in, from this time forth for
evermore” ([Psa. 121.8](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#008.md)<span
id="ii.CXXI-p24.2"></span>). Not thy body; for the Martyrs were consumed
in the body: but “the Lord preserve thy soul;” for the Martyrs yielded
not up their souls. The persecutors raged against Crispina, <span
id="fr_5420"></span>[5421](#fn_5420.md) whose birthday we are to-day
celebrating; they were raging against a rich and delicate woman: but she
was strong, for the Lord was her defence upon the hand of her right
hand. He was her Keeper. Is there any one in Africa, my brethren, who
knoweth her not? For she was most illustrious, noble in birth, abounding
in wealth: but all these things were in her left hand, beneath her head.
An enemy advanced to strike her head, and the left hand was presented to
him, which was under her head. Her head was above, the right hand
embraced her from above. <span id="fr_5421"></span>[5422](#fn_5421.md) …

Torrensis, and Bellarmine have quoted St. Augustin as assigning the
Athanasian Creed to St. Athanasius. But Petavius, *Theol. Dogm. de
Trin*. l. vii. c. 8, note 7, says the words have been foisted into St.
Augustin, and in fact they are not in any of our <span class="c21"><span

\[He thus concludes: “Although the Psalm is short, yet our exposition
and discourse on it hath been long. Imagine, my brethren, that owing to
the birthday of the blessed Crispina I have invited you, and have been
immoderate in protracting the banquet. Might not this have happened to
you, if any military officer had invited you, and compel you to drink at
his table without measure? May it be lawful for us to do this in a
sacred exposition, that ye may be inebriated and satisfied to the
full.”—C.\]
