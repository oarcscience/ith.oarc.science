<span id="ii.XVI-p1"></span> <span id="ii.XVI-p1.1"></span><span
class="c20"><span id="ii.XVI-p1.2"></span>Psalm XVI. <span
id="fr_503"></span>[504](#fn_503) </span>

<span id="ii.XVI-p3"></span>*The inscription of the title, of David
himself.* <span id="fr_504"></span>[505](#fn_504)

<span id="ii.XVI-p5"></span>1. Our King in this Psalm speaks in the
character of the human <span id="fr_505"></span>[506](#fn_505) nature He
assumed, of whom the royal title at the time of His passion was
eminently set forth.

<span id="ii.XVI-p7"></span>2. Now He saith as follows; “Preserve me, O
Lord, for in Thee have I hoped” ([Psa.
16.1](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#001)<span id="ii.XVI-p7.1"></span>):
“I have said to the Lord, Thou art my God, for Thou requirest not my
goods” ([Psa. 16.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#002)<span
id="ii.XVI-p7.2"></span>): for with my goods Thou dost not look to be
made blessed.

<span id="ii.XVI-p8"></span>3. “To the saints who are on His earth”
([Psa. 16.3](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#003)<span
id="ii.XVI-p8.1"></span>): to the saints who have placed their hope in
the land of the living, the citizens of the heavenly Jerusalem, whose
spiritual conversation is, by the anchor of hope, fixed in that country,
which is rightly called God’s earth; although as yet in this earth too
they be conversant in the flesh. “He hath wonderfully fulfilled all My
wishes in them.” To those saints then He hath wonderfully fulfilled all
My wishes in their advancement, whereby they have perceived, how both
the humanity of My divinity hath profited them that I might die, and the
divinity of the humanity that I might rise again.

<span id="ii.XVI-p9"></span>4. “Their infirmities have been
multiplied” <span id="fr_506"></span>[507](#fn_506) ([Psa.
16.4](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#004)<span id="ii.XVI-p10.2"></span>):
their infirmities have been multiplied not for their destruction, but
that they might long for the Physician. “Afterwards they made haste.”
Accordingly after infirmities multiplied they made haste, that they
might be healed. “I will not gather together their assemblies by blood.”
For their assemblies shall not be carnal, nor will I gather them
together as one propitiated by the blood of cattle. <span
id="fr_507"></span>[508](#fn_507) “Nor will I be mindful of their names
within My lips.” But by a spiritual change what they have been shall be
forgotten; nor by Me shall they be any more called either sinners, or
enemies, or men; but righteous, and My brethren, and sons of God through
My peace.

<span id="ii.XVI-p12"></span>5. “The Lord is the portion of Mine
inheritance, and of My cup” ([Psa.
16.5](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#005)<span id="ii.XVI-p12.1"></span>).
For together with Me they shall possess the inheritance, the Lord
Himself. Let others choose for themselves portions, earthly and
temporal, to enjoy: the portion of the Saints is the Lord eternal. Let
others drink of deadly pleasures, the portion of My cup is the Lord. In
that I say, “Mine,” I include the Church: for where the Head is, there
is the body also. For into the inheritance will I gather together their
assemblies, and by the inebriation of the cup I will forget their old
names. “Thou art He who will restore to Me My inheritance:” that to
these too, whom I free, may be known “the glory wherein I was with Thee
before the world was made.” <span id="fr_508"></span>[509](#fn_508) For
Thou wilt not restore to Me that which I never lost, but Thou wilt
restore to these, who have lost it, the knowledge of that glory: in whom
because I am, Thou wilt restore to Me.

<span id="ii.XVI-p14"></span>6. “The lines have fallen to me in glorious
places” ([Psa. 16.6](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#006)<span
id="ii.XVI-p14.1"></span>). The boundaries of my possession have fallen
in Thy glory as it were by lot, like as God is the possession of the
Priests and Levites. <span id="fr_509"></span>[510](#fn_509) “For Mine
inheritance is glorious <span id="page_49">p. 49</span> <span
id="ii.XVI-Page_49"></span>to Me.” “For Mine inheritance is glorious,”
not to all, but to them that see; in whom because I am, “it is to Me.”

<span id="ii.XVI-p16"></span>7. “I will bless the Lord, who hath given
Me understanding” ([Psa. 16.7](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#007)<span
id="ii.XVI-p16.1"></span>): whereby this inheritance may be seen and
possessed. “Yea moreover too even unto night my reins have chastened
Me.” Yea besides understanding, even unto death, My inferior part, the
assumption of flesh, hath instructed Me, that I might experience the
darkness of mortality, which that understanding hath not.

<span id="ii.XVI-p17"></span>8. “I foresaw the Lord in My sight always”
([Psa. 16.8](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#008)<span
id="ii.XVI-p17.1"></span>). But coming into things that pass away, I
removed not Mine eye from Him who abideth ever, foreseeing this, that to
Him I should return after passing through the things temporal. “For He
is on My right hand, that I should not be moved.” For He favoureth Me,
that I should abide fixedly in Him.

<span id="ii.XVI-p18"></span>9. “Wherefore My heart was glad, and My
tongue exulted” ([Psa. 16.9](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#009)<span
id="ii.XVI-p18.1"></span>). Wherefore both in My thoughts is gladness,
and in my words exultation. “Moreover too My flesh shall rest in hope.”
Moreover too My flesh shall not fail unto destruction, but shall sleep
in hope of the resurrection.

<span id="ii.XVI-p19"></span>10. “For Thou wilt not leave My soul in
hell” ([Psa. 16.10](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#010)<span
id="ii.XVI-p19.1"></span>). For Thou wilt neither give My soul for a
possession to those parts below. “Neither wilt Thou grant Thine Holy One
to see corruption.” Neither wilt Thou suffer that sanctified body,
whereby others are to be also sanctified, to see corruption. “Thou hast
made known to Me the paths of life” ([Psa.
16.11](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#011)<span id="ii.XVI-p19.2"></span>).
Thou hast made known through Me the paths of humiliation, that <span
id="fr_510"></span>[511](#fn_510) men might return to life, from whence
they fell through pride; in whom because I am, “Thou hast made known to
Me.” “Thou wilt fill Me with joy with Thy countenance.” Thou wilt fill
them with joy, that they should seek nothing further, when they shall
see Thee “face to face;” in whom because I am, “Thou wilt fill Me.”
“Pleasure is at Thy right hand even to the end.” Pleasure is in Thy
favour and mercy in this life’s journey, leading on even to the end of
the glory of Thy countenance. <span id="fr_511"></span>[512](#fn_511)
