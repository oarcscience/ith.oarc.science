<span id="ii.XIV-p1"></span> <span id="ii.XIV-p1.1"></span><span
class="c20"><span id="ii.XIV-p1.2"></span>Psalm XIV. <span
id="fr_482"></span>[483](#fn_482) </span>

<span id="ii.XIV-p3"></span>To the end, a psalm of David himself.

<span id="ii.XIV-p4"></span>1. What “to the end” means, must not be too
often repeated. “For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to
every one that believeth;” <span id="fr_483"></span>[484](#fn_483) as
the Apostle saith. We believe on Him, when we begin to enter on the good
road: we shall see Him, when we shall get to the end. And therefore is
He the end.

<span id="ii.XIV-p6"></span>2. “The fool hath said in his heart, There
is no God” ([Psa. 14.1](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001)<span
id="ii.XIV-p6.1"></span>). For not even have certain sacrilegious and
abominable philosophers, who entertain perverse and false notions of
God, dared to say, “There is no God.” Therefore it is, hath said “in his
heart;” for that no one dares to say it, even if he has dared to think
it. “They are corrupt, and become abominable in their affections:” that
is, whilst they love this world and love not God; these are the
affections which corrupt the soul, and so blind it, that the fool can
even say, “in his heart, There is no God. For as they did not like to
retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate
mind.” <span id="fr_484"></span>[485](#fn_484) “There is none that doeth
goodness, no not up to one.” “Up to one,” can be understood either with
that one, so that no man be understood: or besides one, that the Lord
Christ may be excepted. As we say, This field is up to the sea; we do
not of course reckon the sea together with the field. And this is the
better interpretation, so that none be understood to have done goodness
up to Christ; for that no man can do goodness, except He shall have
shown it. And that is true; for until a man know the one God, he cannot
do goodness.

<span id="ii.XIV-p8"></span>3. “The Lord from heaven looked out upon the
sons of men, to see if there be one understanding, or seeking after God”
([Psa. 14.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#002)<span
id="ii.XIV-p8.1"></span>). It may be interpreted, upon the Jews; as he
may have given them the more honourable name of the sons of men, by
reason of their worship of the One God, in comparison with the Gentiles;
of whom I suppose it was said above, “The fool hath said in his heart,
There is no God,” etc. Now the Lord looks out, that He may see, by His
holy souls: which is the meaning of, “from heaven.” For by Himself
nothing is hid from Him.

<span id="ii.XIV-p9"></span>4. “All have gone out of the way, they have
together become useless:” that is, the Jews have become as the Gentiles,
who were spoken of above. “There is none that doeth good, no not up to
one” ([Psa. 14.3](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#003)<span
id="ii.XIV-p9.1"></span>), must be interpreted as above. “Their throat
is an open sepulchre.” <span id="fr_485"></span>[486](#fn_485) Either
the voracity of the ever open palate is signified: or allegorically
those who slay, and as it were devour those they have slain, into whom
they instil the disorder of their own conversation. Like to which with
the contrary meaning is that which was said to Peter, “Kill and
eat;” <span id="fr_486"></span>[487](#fn_486) that he should convert the
Gentiles to his own faith and good conversation. “With their tongues
they have dealt craftily.” Flattery is the companion of the greedy and
of all bad men. “The poison of asps is under their lips.” By “poison,”
he means deceit; and “of asps,” because they will not hear the precepts
of the law, as asps “will not hear the voice of the charmer;” <span
id="fr_487"></span>[488](#fn_487) which is said more clearly in another
Psalm. “Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:” this is, “the
poison of asps.” “Their feet are swift to shed blood.” He here shows
forth the habit of ill doing. “Destruction and unhappiness” are <span
id="page_47">p. 47</span> <span id="ii.XIV-Page_47"></span>“in their
ways.” For all the ways of evil men are full of toil and misery. Hence
the Lord cries out, “Come unto Me, all ye that labour and are heavy
laden, and I will refresh you. Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me,
for I am meek and lowly in heart. For My yoke is easy and My burden
light.” <span id="fr_488"></span>[489](#fn_488) “And the way of peace
have they not known:” that way, namely, which the Lord, as I said,
mentions, in the easy yoke and light burden. “There is no fear of God
before their eyes.” These do not say, “There is no God;” but yet they do
not fear God.

<span id="ii.XIV-p14"></span>5. “Shall not all, who work iniquity,
know?” ([Psa. 14.4](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#004)<span
id="ii.XIV-p14.1"></span>). He threatens the judgment. “Who devour My
people as the food of bread:” that is, daily. For the food of bread is
daily food. Now they devour the people, who serve their own ends out of
them, not referring their ministry to the glory of God, and the
salvation of those over whom they are.

<span id="ii.XIV-p15"></span>6. “They have not called upon the Lord.”
For he doth not really call upon Him, who longs for such things as are
displeasing to Him. “There they trembled for fear, where no fear was”
([Psa. 14.5](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#005)<span
id="ii.XIV-p15.1"></span>): that is, for the loss of things temporal.
For they said, “If we let Him thus alone, all men will believe on Him;
and the Romans will come, and take away both our place and
nation.” <span id="fr_489"></span>[490](#fn_489) They feared to lose an
earthly kingdom, where no fear was; and they lost the kingdom of heaven,
which they ought to have feared. And this must be understood of all
temporal goods, the loss of which when men fear, they come not to things
eternal.

<span id="ii.XIV-p17"></span>7. “For God is in the just generation.” It
refers to what went before, so that the sense is, “shall not all they
that work iniquity know that the Lord is in the just generation;” <span
id="fr_490"></span>[491](#fn_490) that is, He is not in them who love
the world. For it is unjust to leave the Maker of the worlds, and “serve
the creature more than the Creator.” <span
id="fr_491"></span>[492](#fn_491) Ye have shamed the counsel of the
poor, for the Lord is his hope” ([Psa.
14.6](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#006)<span id="ii.XIV-p19.2"></span>):
that is, ye have despised the humble coming of the Son of God, because
ye saw not in Him the pomp of the world: that they, whom he was calling,
should put their hope in God alone, not in the things that pass away.

<span id="ii.XIV-p20"></span>8. “Who will give salvation to Israel out
of Sion?” ([Psa. 14.7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#007)<span
id="ii.XIV-p20.1"></span>). Who but He whose humiliation ye have
despised? is understood. For He will come in glory to the judgment of
the quick and the dead, and the kingdom of the just: that, forasmuch as
in that humble coming “blindness hath happened in part unto Israel, that
the fulness of the Gentiles might enter in,” <span
id="fr_492"></span>[493](#fn_492) in that other should happen what
follows, “and so all Israel should be saved.” For the Apostle too takes
that testimony of Isaiah, where it is said, “There shall come out of
Sion He who shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:” <span
id="fr_493"></span>[494](#fn_493) for the Jews, as it is here, “Who
shall give salvation to Israel out of Sion?” “When the Lord shall turn
away the captivity of His people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall
be glad.” <span id="fr_494"></span>[495](#fn_494) It is a repetition, as
is usual: for I suppose, “Israel shall be glad,” is the same as, “Jacob
shall rejoice.”
