<span id="ii.XIII-p1"></span> <span id="ii.XIII-p1.1"></span><span
class="c20"><span id="ii.XIII-p1.2"></span>Psalm XII. <span
id="fr_477"></span>[478](#fn_477.md) </span>

<span id="ii.XIII-p3"></span>Unto the end, a psalm of David.

<span id="ii.XIII-p4"></span>1. “For Christ is the end of the law to
every one that believeth.” <span id="fr_478"></span>[479](#fn_478.md) “How
long, O Lord, wilt Thou forget me unto the end?” ([Psa.
13.1](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#001)<span id="ii.XIII-p5.2"></span>.md)
that is, put me off as to spiritually understanding Christ, who is the
Wisdom of God, and the true end of all the aim of the soul. “How long
dost Thou turn away Thy face from me?” As God doth not forget, so
neither doth He turn His face away: but Scripture speaks after our
manner. Now God is said to turn away His face, when He doth not give to
the soul, which as yet hath not the pure eye of the mind, the knowledge
of Himself.

<span id="ii.XIII-p6"></span>2. “How long shall I place counsel in my
soul?” ([Psa. 13.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#002.md)<span
id="ii.XIII-p6.1"></span>). There is no need of counsel but in
adversity. Therefore “How long shall I place counsel in my soul?” is as
if it were said, How long shall I be in adversity? Or at least it is an
answer, so that the meaning is this, So long, O Lord, wilt Thou forget
me to the end, and so long turn away Thy face from me, until I shall
place counsel in mine own soul: so that except a man place counsel in
his own soul to work mercy perfectly, God will not direct him to the
end, nor give him that full knowledge of Himself, which is “face to
face.” “Sorrow in my heart through the day?” How long shall I have, is
understood. And “through the day” signifies continuance, so that day is
taken for time: from which as each one longs to be free, he has sorrow
in his heart, making entreaty to rise to things eternal, and not endure
man’s day.

<span id="ii.XIII-p7"></span>3. “How long shall mine enemy be exalted
over me?” either the devil, or carnal habit.

<span id="ii.XIII-p8"></span><span id="page_46">p. 46</span> <span
id="ii.XIII-Page_46"></span>4. “Look on me, and hear me, O Lord my God”
([Psa. 13.3](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#003.md)<span
id="ii.XIII-p8.1"></span>). “Look on me,” refers to what was said, “How
long” dost “Thou turn away Thy face from me.” “Hear,” refers to what was
said, “How long wilt Thou forget me to the end? Lighten mine eyes, that
I sleep not in death.” The eyes of the heart must be understood, that
they be not closed by the pleasurable eclipse of sin.

<span id="ii.XIII-p9"></span>5. “Lest at any time mine enemy say, I have
prevailed against him” ([Psa.
13.4](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#004)<span id="ii.XIII-p9.1"></span>.md).
The devil’s mockery is to be feared. “They that trouble me will exult,
if I be moved;” the devil and his angels; who exulted not over that
righteous man, Job, when they troubled him; because he was not moved,
that is, did not draw back from the stedfastness of his faith. <span
id="fr_479"></span>[480](#fn_479.md)

<span id="ii.XIII-p11"></span>6. “But I have hoped in Thy mercy” ([Psa.
13.5](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#005)<span id="ii.XIII-p11.1"></span>.md).
Because this very thing, that a man be not moved, and that he abide
fixed in the Lord, he should not attribute to self: lest when he glories
that he hath not been moved, he be moved by this very pride. “My heart
shall exult in Thy salvation;” in Christ, in the Wisdom of God. “I will
sing <span id="fr_480"></span>[481](#fn_480.md) to the Lord who hath given
me good things;” spiritual good things, not belonging to man’s day. “And
I will chant <span id="fr_481"></span>[482](#fn_481.md) to the name of the
Lord most high” ([Psa. 13.6](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#006.md)<span
id="ii.XIII-p13.1"></span>); that is, I give thanks with joy, and in
most due order employ my body, which is the song of the spiritual soul.
But if any distinction is to be marked here, “I will sing” with the
heart, “I will chant” with my works; “to the Lord,” that which He alone
seeth, but “to the name of the Lord,” that which is known among men,
which is serviceable not for Him, but for us.
