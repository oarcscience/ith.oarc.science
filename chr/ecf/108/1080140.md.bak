<span id="ii.CXIX.x-p2"></span>72. …“Thy hands have made me, and
fashioned me” ([Psa. 119.73](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#073.md)<span
id="ii.CXIX.x-p2.1"></span>). The hands of God are the power of God. Or
if the plural number moveth them, since it is not said, Thy hand, but,
“Thy hands;” let them understand by the hands of God the power and
wisdom of God, both of which titles are given to one Christ, <span
id="fr_5226"></span>[5227](#fn_5226.md) who is also understood under the
figure, Arm of the Lord. <span id="fr_5227"></span>[5228](#fn_5227.md) Or
let them understand by the hands of God, the Son and the Holy Spirit;
since the Holy Spirit worketh conjointly with the Father and the Son:
whence saith the Apostle, “But all these worketh that one and the
self-same Spirit:” <span id="fr_5228"></span>[5229](#fn_5228.md) he said,
“one and the self-same;” lest as many spirits as works might be
imagined, not that the Spirit worketh without the Father and the Son. It
is easy therefore to see how the hands of God are to be understood:
provided, at the same time, that He be not denied to do those things
through His Word which He doth by His hands: nor be considered not to do
those things with His hands, which He doth through His word.…But is this
said in respect of Adam? from whom since all men were propagated, what
man, since Adam was made, may not say that he himself also was made by
reason of procreation and generation from Adam? Or may it rightly be
said, in this sense, “Thy hands have made me, and fashioned me,” namely,
that every man is born even of his parents not without the work of God,
God creating, they generating? Since, if the creative <span
id="fr_5229"></span>[5230](#fn_5229.md) power of God be withdrawn from
things, they perish: nor is anything at all, either of the world’s
elements, or of parents, or of seeds, produced, if God doth not create
it.…

<span id="ii.CXIX.x-p7"></span>73. The Greek version hath a more concise
expression for our, “Give me understanding,” <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.CXIX.x-p7.1"></span>συν™τισον με</span>, expressing “give
understanding” by the single word <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.CXIX.x-p7.2"></span> συν™τισον</span>, which the Latin cannot do;
as if one could not say, Heal me; and it were necessary to say, Give me
health, as it is here said, “Give me understanding;” or, make me whole,
as here it may be said, make me intelligent. This indeed an Angel could
do: for he said to Daniel, “I am come to give thee understanding;” <span
id="fr_5230"></span>[5231](#fn_5230.md) and this word is in the Greek, as
it is here also, <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.CXIX.x-p8.2"></span>συν™τισαί σε</span>; as if the Latin
translator were to render <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.CXIX.x-p8.3"></span>θεραπεῦσαί σε</span> by *sanitatem dare
tibi.* For the Latin interpreter would not make a circumlocution by
saying, to give thee understanding, if, as we say from health, “to heal
thee,” so one could say from intellect, “to intellectuate thee.” But if
an Angel could do this, what reason is there that this man should pray
that this be done for him by God? Is it because God had commanded the
Angel to do it? Just so: for Christ is understood to have given this
command to the Angel. <span id="fr_5231"></span>[5232](#fn_5231.md) …

<span id="ii.CXIX.x-p10"></span>74. “That I may learn Thy commandments.”
Since Thou, saith he, hast formed me, do Thou new form me; that that may
be done in Christ’s Body, which the Apostle speaks of, “Be transformed
by the renewing of your mind.” <span
id="fr_5232"></span>[5233](#fn_5232.md)

<span id="ii.CXIX.x-p12"></span>75. “They that fear Thee,” he saith,
“will see me, and be glad” ([Psa.
119.74](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#074.md)<span
id="ii.CXIX.x-p12.1"></span>): or, as other copies have it, “will be
joyful: because I have hoped in Thy word:” that is, in the things which
Thou hast promised, that they may be the sons of promise, the seed of
Abraham, in whom all nations are blessed. <span
id="fr_5233"></span>[5234](#fn_5233.md) Who are they who fear God, and whom
will they see and be glad, because he hath put his trust in the word of
God? Whether it be the body of Christ, that is, the Church, whose words
these are through Christ, or within it, and concerning it, these are as
it were the words of Christ concerning Himself; are not they themselves
among those who fear God?…The same persons, who see the Church and are
glad, are the Church. But why said he not, They who fear Thee see me,
and are glad: whereas he hath written, “fear Thee,” in the present
tense; while the verbs “shall see,” and shall “be glad,” are futures? Is
it because in the present state there is fear, as long as “man’s life is
a temptation upon earth;” <span id="fr_5234"></span>[5235](#fn_5234.md) but
the gladness which he desired to be understood, will be then, when “the
righteous shall shine in the kingdom of their Father like the
sun.” <span id="fr_5235"></span>[5236](#fn_5235.md) …

<span id="ii.CXIX.x-p16"></span>76. “I know,” she saith, “O Lord, that
Thy judgments are righteous, and that in Thy truth Thou hast humbled me”
([Psa. 119.75](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#075.md)<span
id="ii.CXIX.x-p16.1"></span>). “O let Thy merciful kindness be my
comfort, according to Thy word unto Thy servant” ([Psa.
119.76](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#076.md)<span
id="ii.CXIX.x-p16.2"></span>). Mercy and truth are so spoken of in the
Divine Word, that, while they are found in many passages, especially in
the Psalms, it is also so read in one place, “All the paths of the Lord
are mercy and truth.” <span id="fr_5236"></span>[5237](#fn_5236.md) And
here indeed he hath placed truth first, whereby we are humbled unto
death, by the judgment of Him whose judgments are righteousness: next
mercy, whereby we are renewed unto life, by the promise of Him whose
blessing is His grace. For this reason he saith, “according to Thy Word
unto Thy servant:” that is, according to that which Thou hast promised
unto Thy servant. Whether therefore it be regeneration whereby we are
here adopted among the sons of God, or faith and hope and charity, which
three are built up in us, although they <span id="page_573">p.
573</span> <span id="ii.CXIX.x-Page_573"></span>come from the mercy of
God; nevertheless, in this stormy and troublesome life they are the
consolations of the miserable, not the joys of the blessed.

<span id="ii.CXIX.x-p18"></span>77. But since those things are destined
to happen after and through these, he next saith, “O let Thy loving
mercies come upon me, and I shall live” ([Psa.
119.77](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#077.md)<span
id="ii.CXIX.x-p18.1"></span>). For then indeed I shall truly live, when
I shall not be able to fear lest I die. This is styled life absolutely
and without any addition; nor is any life save that which is everlasting
and blessed understood, as though it alone were to be called life,
compared with which that which we now lead ought rather to be called
death than life: according to those words in the Gospel, “If thou wilt
enter into life, keep the commandments.” <span
id="fr_5237"></span>[5238](#fn_5237.md) …

<span id="ii.CXIX.x-p20"></span>78. He then goeth on as follows: “Let
the proud be confounded, for they have unrighteously practised iniquity
against me: but I will be occupied in Thy commandments” ([Psa.
119.78](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#078.md)<span
id="ii.CXIX.x-p20.1"></span>). Behold, what he saith, the meditation of
the law of God, or rather, his meditation the law of God.

<span id="ii.CXIX.x-p21"></span>79. “Let such as fear Thee,” he saith,
“and have known Thy testimonies, be turned unto me” <span
id="fr_5238"></span>[5239](#fn_5238.md) ([Psa.
119.79](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#079.md)<span
id="ii.CXIX.x-p22.1"></span>). But who is he who saith this? For no
mortal will venture to say this, or if he say it, should be listened to.
Indeed, it is He who above also hath interposed His own words, saying,
“I am a partaker with all them that fear Thee.” Because He was made
sharer in our mortal state, that we might also become partakers in His
Divine Nature, we became sharers in One unto life, He a sharer in many
unto death. He it is unto whom they that fear God turn, and who know the
testimonies of God, so long before predicted of Him through the
Prophets, a little before displayed in His presence through miracles.

<span id="ii.CXIX.x-p23"></span>80. “O let my heart,” he saith, “be
unspotted in Thy righteousnesses, that I be not ashamed” ([Psa.
119.80](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#080.md)<span
id="ii.CXIX.x-p23.1"></span>). He returneth to the words of His body,
that is, His holy people, and now prayeth that his heart may be made
unspotted, that is, the heart of His members; “in the righteousnesses of
God,” not in their own strength: for He hath prayed for this, not
presumed upon it. In the words he hath added, “that I be not ashamed,”
there is a resemblance to some of the earlier verses of this
Psalm. <span id="fr_5239"></span>[5240](#fn_5239.md) Whereas there, in the
words, “O that,” he signifieth a wish, he hath here expressed himself in
the more open words of one praying: “O let my heart be sound:” so that
in neither of these two sentences, each of which is one and the same,
there is found the boldness of one who trusteth in his own free will
against grace. While he saith there, “so shall I not be confounded:” he
saith here, “that I be not ashamed.” The heart then of the members and
the body of Christ is made unspotted, through the grace of God, by means
of the very Head of that Body, that is, through Jesus Christ our Lord,
by the “laver of regeneration,” <span
id="fr_5240"></span>[5241](#fn_5240.md) wherein all our past sins have been
blotted out; through the aid of the Spirit, whereby we lust against the
flesh, that we be not overcome in our fight; <span
id="fr_5241"></span>[5242](#fn_5241.md) through the efficacy of the Lord’s
Prayer, wherein we say, “Forgive us our trespasses.” <span
id="fr_5242"></span>[5243](#fn_5242.md) Thus regeneration having been given
to us, our conflict having been aided, prayer having been poured forth,
our heart is made unspotted, so that we be not ashamed. <span
id="fr_5243"></span>[5244](#fn_5243.md)
