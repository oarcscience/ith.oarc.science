<span id="ii.XLII-p1"></span> <span id="ii.XLII-p1.1"></span><span
class="c20"><span id="ii.XLII-p1.2"></span>Psalm XLII. <span
id="fr_1220"></span>[1221](#fn_1220.md) </span>

<span id="ii.XLII-p3"></span>1. We have undertaken the exposition of a
Psalm corresponding to your own “longings,” on which we propose to speak
to you. For the Psalm itself begins with a certain pious “longing;” and
he who sings so, says, “Like as the hart desireth the water-brooks, so
longeth my soul after Thee, O God” ([Psa.
42.1](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#001)<span id="ii.XLII-p3.1"></span>.md).
Who is it then that saith this? It is ourselves, if we be but willing!
And why ask, who it is other than thyself, when it is in thy power to be
the thing which thou art asking about? It is not however one individual,
but it is “One Body;” but “Christ’s Body is the Church.” <span
id="fr_1221"></span>[1222](#fn_1221.md) Such “longing” indeed is not found
in all who enter the Church: let all however who have “tasted” the
sweetness “of the Lord,” <span id="fr_1222"></span>[1223](#fn_1222.md) and
who own in Christ that for which they have a relish, think that they are
not the only ones; but that there are such seeds scattered throughout
“the field” of the Lord, this whole earth: and that there is a certain
Christian unity, whose voice thus speaks, “Like as the hart desireth the
water-brooks, so longeth my soul after Thee, O God.” And indeed it is
not ill understood as the cry of those, who being as yet
Catechumens, <span id="fr_1223"></span>[1224](#fn_1223.md) are hastening to
the grace of the holy Font. On which account too this Psalm is
ordinarily <span id="fr_1224"></span>[1225](#fn_1224.md) chanted on those
occasions, that they may long for the Fountain of remission of sins,
even “as the hart for the water-brooks.” Let this be allowed; and this
meaning retain its place in the Church; a place both truthful and
sanctioned by usage. <span id="fr_1225"></span>[1226](#fn_1225.md)
Nevertheless, it appears to me, my brethren, that such “a longing” is
not fully satisfied even in the faithful in Baptism: but that haply, if
they know where they are sojourning, and whither they have to remove
from hence, their “longing” is kindled in even greater intensity.

<span id="ii.XLII-p9"></span>2. The title then of it is, “On the end: a
Psalm for understanding for the sons of Korah.” We have met with the
sons of Korah in other titles of Psalms: <span
id="fr_1226"></span>[1227](#fn_1226.md) and remember to have discussed and
stated already the meaning of this name. Yet we must even now take
notice of this title in such a way, that what we have said already
should be no prejudice against our saying it again: for all were not
present in every place where we said it. Now Korah may have been, as
indeed he was, a certain definite person; and have had sons, who might
be called “the sons of Korah;” let us however search for the secret of
which this is the sacrament, that this name may bring to light the
mystery with which it is pregnant. For there is some great mystery in
the matter that the name “sons of Korah” is given to Christians. Why
“sons of Korah”? They are “sons of the bridegroom, sons of
Christ.” <span id="fr_1227"></span>[1228](#fn_1227.md) Why then does
“Korah” stand for Christ? Because “Korah” is equivalent to
“Calvaria.”…Therefore, the “sons of the bridegroom,” the sons of His
Passion, the sons redeemed by His Blood, the sons of His Cross, who bear
on their forehead that which His enemies erected on Calvary, are called
“the sons of Korah;” to them is this Psalm sung as a Psalm for
“understanding.” Let then our understanding be roused: and if the Psalm
be sung to us, let us follow it with our “understanding.”…Run to the
brooks; long after the water-brooks. “With God is the fountain of Life;”
a “fountain” that shall never be dried up: in His “Light” is a Light
that shall never be darkened. Long thou for this light: for a certain
fountain, a certain light, such as thy bodily eyes know not; a light to
see which the inward eye must be prepared; a fountain, to drink of which
the inward thirst is to be kindled. Run to the fountain; long for the
fountain; but do it not anyhow, be not satisfied <span id="page_133">p.
133</span> <span id="ii.XLII-Page_133"></span>with running like any
ordinary animal; run thou “like the hart.” What is meant by “like the
hart”? Let there be no sloth in thy running; run with all thy might:
long for the fountain with all thy might. For we find in “the hart” an
emblem of swiftness.

<span id="ii.XLII-p12"></span>3. But perhaps Scripture meant us to
consider in the stag not this point only, but another also. Hear what
else there is in the hart. It destroys serpents, <span
id="fr_1228"></span>[1229](#fn_1228.md) and after the killing of serpents,
it is inflamed with thirst yet more violent; having destroyed serpents,
it runs to “the water-brooks,” with thirst more keen than before. The
serpents are thy vices, destroy the serpents of iniquity; then wilt thou
long yet more for “the Fountain of Truth.” Perhaps avarice whispers in
thine ear some dark counsel, hisses against the word of God, hisses
against the commandment of God. And since it is said to thee, “Disregard
this or that thing,” if thou prefer working iniquity to despising some
temporal good, thou choosest to be bitten by a serpent, rather than
destroy it. Whilst, therefore, thou art yet indulgent to thy vice, thy
covetousness or thy appetite, when am I to find in thee “a longing” such
as this, that might make thee run to the water-brooks?…

<span id="ii.XLII-p14"></span>4. There is another point to be observed
in the hart. It is reported of stags…that when they either wander in the
herds, or when they are swimming to reach some other parts of the earth,
that they support the burdens of their heads on each other, in such a
manner as that one takes the lead, and others follow, resting their
heads upon him, as again others who follow do upon them, and others in
succession to the very end of the herd; but the one who took the lead in
bearing the burden of their heads, when tired, returns to the rear, and
rests himself after his fatigue by supporting his head just as did the
others; by thus supporting what is burdensome, each in turn, they both
accomplish their journey, and do not abandon each other. Are they not a
kind of “harts” that the Apostle addresses, saying, “Bear ye one
another’s burdens, and so fulfil the Law of Christ”? <span
id="fr_1229"></span>[1230](#fn_1229.md) …

<span id="ii.XLII-p16"></span>5. “My soul is athirst for the living God”
([Psa. 42.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#002.md)<span
id="ii.XLII-p16.1"></span>). What I am saying, that “as the hart panteth
after the water-brooks, so longs my soul after Thee, O God,” means this,
“My soul is athirst for the living God.” For what is it athirst? “When
shall I come and appear before God?” This it is for which I am athirst,
to “come and to appear before Him.” I am athirst in my pilgrimage, in my
running; I shall be filled on my arrival. But “When shall I come?” And
this, which is soon in the sight of God, is late to our “longing.” <span
id="fr_1230"></span>[1231](#fn_1230.md) “When shall I come and appear
before God?” This too proceeds from that “longing,” of which in another
place comes that cry, “One thing have I desired of the Lord; that will I
seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my
life.” Wherefore so? “That I may behold” (he saith) “the beauty of the
Lord.” <span id="fr_1231"></span>[1232](#fn_1231.md) “When shall I come and
appear before the Lord?”…

<span id="ii.XLII-p19"></span>6. “My tears have been my meat day and
night, while they daily say unto me, Where is thy God?” ([Psa.
42.3](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#003)<span id="ii.XLII-p19.1"></span>.md).
My tears (he saith) have been not bitterness, but “my bread.” Those very
tears were sweet unto me: being athirst for that fountain, inasmuch as I
was not as yet able to drink of it, I have eagerly made my tears my
meat. For he said not, “My tears became my drink,” lest he should seem
to have longed for them, as for “the water-brooks:” but, still retaining
that thirst wherewith I burn, and by which I am hurried away towards the
water-brooks, “My tears became my meat,” whilst I am not yet
there. <span id="fr_1232"></span>[1233](#fn_1232.md) And assuredly he does
but the more thirst for the water-brooks from making his tears his
meat.…“And they daily say unto me, Where is thy God?” For if a Pagan
should say this to me, I cannot retort it upon him, saying, “Where is
thine?” inasmuch as he points with his finger to some stone, and says,
“Lo, there is my God!” When I have laughed at the stone, and he who
pointed to it has been put to the blush, he raises his eyes from the
stone, looks up to heaven, and perhaps says, pointing his finger to the
Sun, “Behold there my God! Where, I pray, is your God?” He has found
something to point out to the eyes of the flesh; whereas I, on my part,
not that I have not a God to show to him, cannot show him what he has no
eyes to see. For he indeed could point out to my bodily eyes his God,
the Sun; but what eyes hath he to which I might point out the Creator of
the Sun?…

<span id="ii.XLII-p21"></span>7. “I thought on these things, and poured
out my soul above myself” <span id="fr_1233"></span>[1234](#fn_1233.md)
([Psa. 42.4](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#004.md)<span
id="ii.XLII-p22.2"></span>). When would my soul attain to that object of
its search, which is “above my soul,” if my soul were not to “pour
itself out above itself”? For were it to rest in itself, it would not
see anything else beyond itself; and in seeing itself, would not, for
all that, see God. Let then my insulting enemies now say, “Where is thy
God?” aye, let them say it! I, so long as I do not “see,” so long as my
happiness is postponed, make my tears my “bread day and night.” Let them
<span id="page_134">p. 134</span> <span
id="ii.XLII-Page_134"></span>still say, “Where is thy God?” I seek my
God in every corporeal nature, terrestrial or celestial, and find Him
not: I seek His Substance in my own soul, and I find it not, yet still I
have thought on these things, and wishing to “see the invisible things
of my God, being understood by the things made,” <span
id="fr_1234"></span>[1235](#fn_1234.md) I have poured forth my soul above
myself, and there remains no longer any being for me to attain to, save
my God. For it is “there” is the “house of my God.” His dwelling-place
is above my soul; from thence He beholds me; from thence He created me;
from thence He directs me and provides for me; from thence he appeals
to <span id="fr_1235"></span>[1236](#fn_1235.md) me, and calls me, and
directs me; leads me in the way, and to the end of my way. <span
id="fr_1236"></span>[1237](#fn_1236.md) …

<span id="ii.XLII-p26"></span>8. For when I was “pouring out my soul
above myself,” in order to reach my God, why did I do so? “For I will go
into the place of Thy Tabernacle.” For I should be in error were I to
seek for my God without “the place of His tabernacle.” “For I will go
into the place of Thy wonderful tabernacle, even unto the house of God.”

<span id="ii.XLII-p27"></span>“I will go,” he says, “into the place of
the wonderful tabernacle, even unto the house of God!” For there are
already many things that I admire in “the tabernacle.” See how great
wonders I admire in the tabernacle! For God’s tabernacle on earth is the
faithful; I admire in them the obedience of even their bodily members:
that in them “Sin does not reign so that they should obey its lusts;
neither do they yield their members instruments of unrighteousness unto
sin; but unto the living God in good works.” <span
id="fr_1237"></span>[1238](#fn_1237.md) I admire the sight of the bodily
members warring in the service of the soul that serves God.…And
wonderful though the tabernacle be, yet when I come to “the house of
God,” I am even struck dumb with astonishment. Of that “house” he speaks
in another Psalm, after he had put a certain abstruse and difficult
question to himself (viz., why is it that it generally goes well with
the wicked on earth, and ill with the good?), saying, “I thought to know
this; it is too painful for me, until I go into the sanctuary of God,
and understand of the last things.” <span
id="fr_1238"></span>[1239](#fn_1238.md) For it is there, in the sanctuary
of God, in the house of God, is the fountain of “understanding.” There
he “understood of the last things;” and solved the question concerning
the prosperity of the unrighteous, and the sufferings of the righteous.
How does he solve it? Why, that the wicked, when reprieved here, are
reserved for punishments without end; and the good when they suffer
here, are being tried in order that they may in the end obtain the
inheritance. And it was in the sanctuary of God that he understood this,
and “understood of the last things.”…For he tells us of his progress,
and of his guidance thither; as if we had been saying, “You are admiring
the tabernacle here on earth; how came you to the sanctuary of the house
of God?” he says, “In the voice of joy and praise; the sound of keeping
holiday.” Here, when men keep festival simply for their own indulgence,
it is their custom to place musical instruments, or to station a chorus
of singers,  <span id="fr_1239"></span>[1240](#fn_1239.md) before their
houses, or any kind of music that serves and allures to wantonness. And
when these are heard, what do we passers by say? “What is going on
here?” And we are told in answer, that it is some festival. “It is a
birthday that is being celebrated” (say they), “there is a marriage
here;” that those songs may not appear out of place, but the luxurious
indulgence <span id="fr_1240"></span>[1241](#fn_1240.md) may be excused by
the festive occasion. In the “house of God” there is a never-ending
festival: for there it is not an occasion celebrated once, and then to
pass away. <span id="fr_1241"></span>[1242](#fn_1241.md) The angelic choir
makes an eternal “holiday:” the presence of God’s face, joy that never
fails. This is a “holiday” of such a kind, as neither to be opened by
any dawn, nor terminated by any evening. From that everlasting perpetual
festivity, a certain sweet and melodious strain strikes on the ears of
the heart, provided only the world do not drown the sounds. As he walks
in this tabernacle, and contemplates God’s wonderful works for the
redemption of the faithful, the sound of that festivity charms his ears,
and bears the “hart” away to “the water-brooks.”

<span id="ii.XLII-p33"></span>9. But seeing, brethren, so long as “we
are at home in this body, we are absent from the Lord;” <span
id="fr_1242"></span>[1243](#fn_1242.md) and “the corruptible body presseth
down the soul, and the earthly tabernacle weigheth down the mind that
museth on many things;” <span id="fr_1243"></span>[1244](#fn_1243.md) even
though we have some way or other dispersed the clouds, by walking as
“longing” leads us on, and for a brief while have come within reach of
that sound, so that by an effort we may catch something from that “house
of God,” yet through the burden, so to speak, of our infirmity, we sink
back to our usual level, and relapse to our ordinary state. <span
id="fr_1244"></span>[1245](#fn_1244.md) And just as there we found <span
id="page_135">p. 135</span> <span id="ii.XLII-Page_135"></span>cause for
rejoicing, so here there will not be wanting an occasion for sorrow. For
that hart that made “tears” its “bread day and night,” borne along by
“longing to the water-brooks” (that is, to the spiritual delights of
God), “pouring forth his soul above himself,” that he may attain to what
is “above” his own soul, walking towards “the place of the wonderful
tabernacle, even unto the house of God,” and led on by the sweetness of
that inward spiritual <span id="fr_1245"></span>[1246](#fn_1245.md) sound
to feel contempt for all outward things, and be borne on to things
spiritual, is but a mortal man still; is still groaning here, still
bearing about the frailty of flesh, still in peril in the midst of the
“offences” <span id="fr_1246"></span>[1247](#fn_1246.md) of this world. He
therefore glances back to himself, <span
id="fr_1247"></span>[1248](#fn_1247.md) as if he were coming from that
world; and says to himself, now placed in the midst of these sorrows,
comparing these with the things, to see which he had entered in there,
and after seeing which he had come forth from thence;

<span id="ii.XLII-p57"></span>“Why art thou cast down, O my soul, and
why dost thou disquiet me?” ([Psa.
42.5](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#005)<span id="ii.XLII-p57.1"></span>.md).
Lo, we have just now been gladdened by certain inward delights: with the
mind’s eye we have been able to behold, though but with a momentary
glance, something not susceptible of change: why dost thou still
“disquiet me, why art thou” still “cast down”? For thou dost not doubt
of thy God. For now thou art not without somewhat to say to thyself, in
answer to those who say, “Where is thy God?” I have now had the
perception of something that is unchangeable; why dost thou disquiet me
still?

<span id="ii.XLII-p58"></span>“Hope in God.” Just as if his soul was
silently replying to him, “Why do I disquiet thee, but because I am not
yet there, where that delight is, to which I was, as it were, rapt for a
moment? <span id="fr_1248"></span>[1249](#fn_1248.md) Am I already
‘drinking’ from this ‘fountain’ with nothing to fear?”…Still “Hope in
God,” is his answer to the soul that disquiets him, and would fain
account for her disquiet from the evils with which this world abounds.
In the mean while dwell in hope: for “hope that is seen is not hope; but
if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for
it.” <span id="fr_1249"></span>[1250](#fn_1249.md)

<span id="ii.XLII-p61"></span>10. “Hope in God.” Why “hope”? “For I will
confess unto Him.” What wilt thou “confess”? “My God is the saving
health of my countenance.” My “health” (my salvation) cannot be from
myself; this it is that I will say, that I will “confess.” It is my God
that is “the saving health of my countenance.” <span
id="fr_1250"></span>[1251](#fn_1250.md) For to account for his fears, in
the midst of those things, which he now knows, having come after a sort
to the “understanding” of them, <span
id="fr_1251"></span>[1252](#fn_1251.md) he has been looking behind him
again in anxiety, lest the enemy be stealing upon him: he cannot yet
say, “I am made whole every whit.” For having but “the first-fruits of
the Spirit, we groan within ourselves; waiting for the adoption, to wit,
the redemption of the body.” <span id="fr_1252"></span>[1253](#fn_1252.md)
When that “health” (that salvation) is perfected in us, then shall we be
living in the house of God for ever, and praising for ever Him to whom
it was said, “Blessed are they that dwell in Thy house, they will be
praising Thee world without end.” <span
id="fr_1253"></span>[1254](#fn_1253.md) This is not so yet, because the
salvation which is promised, is not as yet in being; but it is “in hope”
that I confess unto God, and say, “My God is the saving health of my
countenance.” For it is “in hope” that “we are saved; but hope that is
seen, is not hope.”…

<span id="ii.XLII-p66"></span>11. “My soul is disquieted on account of
myself” <span id="fr_1254"></span>[1255](#fn_1254.md) ([Psa.
42.6](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#006)<span id="ii.XLII-p67.1"></span>.md).
Is it disquieted on account of God? It is on my own account it is
disquieted. By the Unchangeable it was revived; it is by the changeable
it is disquieted. I know that the righteousness of God remaineth;
whether my own will remain stedfast, I know not. For I am alarmed by the
Apostle’s saying, “Let him that thinketh he standeth, take heed lest he
fall.” <span id="fr_1255"></span>[1256](#fn_1255.md) Therefore since “there
is no soundness in me for myself,” there is no hope either for me of
myself. “My soul is disquieted on account of myself.”…“Therefore I
remember Thee, O Lord, from the land of Jordan, and from the little hill
of Hermon.” From whence did I remember thee? From the “little hill,” and
from the “land of Jordan.” Perhaps from Baptism, where the remission of
sins is given. For no one runs to the remission of sins, except he who
is dissatisfied with himself; no one runs to the remission of sins, but
he who confesses himself a sinner; no one confesses himself a sinner,
except by humbling himself before God. Therefore it is from “the land of
Jordan I have remembered thee, and from the hill;” observe, not “of the
great hill,” that thou mayest make of the “little hill” a great one: for
“whoso exalteth himself shall be abased, and whoso humbleth himself
shall be exalted.” If you would also ask the meanings of the names,
Jordan means “their descent.” Descend then, that thou mayest be “lifted
up:” be not lifted up, lest thou be cast down. “And the little hill of
Hermon.” Hermon means “anathematizing.” Anathematize thyself, by being
displeased with thyself; for if thou art pleased with thyself, God will
be displeased with thee. Because then God gives us all good things,
because He Himself is good, not because we are worthy of it; because He
is merciful, not because <span id="page_136">p. 136</span> <span
id="ii.XLII-Page_136"></span>we have in anything deserved it; it is from
“the land of Jordan, and from Hermon,” that I remember thee. And because
he so remembers with humility, he shall earn his exaltation to
fruition, <span id="fr_1256"></span>[1257](#fn_1256.md) for he is not
“exalted” in himself, who “glories in the Lord.”

<span id="ii.XLII-p70"></span>12. “Deep calleth unto deep with the voice
of thy water-spouts” <span id="fr_1257"></span>[1258](#fn_1257.md) ([Psa.
42.7](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#007)<span id="ii.XLII-p71.1"></span>.md).
I may perhaps finish the Psalm, aided as I am by your attention, whose
fervour I perceive. As for your fatigue in hearing, I am not greatly
solicitous, since you see me also, who speak, toiling in the heat of
these exertions. <span id="fr_1258"></span>[1259](#fn_1258.md) Assuredly it
is from your seeing me labouring, that you labour with me: for I am
labouring not for myself, but for you. “Deep calleth unto deep with the
voice of thy water-spouts.” It was God whom he addressed, who
“remembered him from the land of Jordan and Hermon.” It was in wonder
and admiration he spake this: “Abyss calleth unto abyss with the voice
of Thy water-spouts.” What abyss is this that calls, and to what other
abyss? Justly, because the “understanding”  <span
id="fr_1259"></span>[1260](#fn_1259.md) spoken of is an “abyss.” For an
“abyss” is a depth that cannot be reached or comprehended; and it is
principally applied to a great body of water. For there is a “depth,” a
“profound,” the bottom of which cannot be reached by sounding.
Furthermore, it is said in a certain passage, <span
id="fr_1260"></span>[1261](#fn_1260.md) “Thy judgments are a mighty abyss,”
Scripture meaning to suggest that the judgments of God are
incomprehensible. What then is the “abyss” that calls, and to what other
“abyss” does it call? If by “abyss” we understand a great depth, is not
man’s heart, do you not suppose, “an abyss”? For what is there more
profound than that “abyss”? Men may speak, may be seen by the operations
of their members, may be heard speaking in conversation: but whose
thought is penetrated, whose heart seen into? What he is inwardly
engaged on, what he is inwardly capable of, <span
id="fr_1261"></span>[1262](#fn_1261.md) what he is inwardly doing or what
purposing, what he is inwardly wishing to happen, or not to happen, who
shall comprehend? I think an “abyss” may not unreasonably be understood
of man, of whom it is said elsewhere, “Man shall come to a deep heart,
and God shall be exalted.” <span id="fr_1262"></span>[1263](#fn_1262.md) If
man then is an “abyss,” in what way doth “abyss” call on “abyss”? Does
man “call on” man as God is called upon? No, but “calls on” is
equivalent to “calls to him.” For it was said of a certain person, he
calls on death; <span id="fr_1263"></span>[1264](#fn_1263.md) that is,
lives in such a way as to be inviting death; for there is no man at all
who puts up a prayer, and calls expressly on death: but men by
evil-living invite death. “Deep <span
id="fr_1264"></span>[1265](#fn_1264.md) calls on deep,” then, is, “man
calls to man.” Thus is it wisdom is learnt, and thus faith, when “man
calls to man.” The holy preachers of God’s word call on the “deep:” are
they not themselves “a deep” also?…

<span id="ii.XLII-p79"></span>13. “Deep calleth to deep with the voice
of Thy water-spouts.” I, who tremble all over, when my soul was
disquieted on account of myself, feared greatly on account of Thy
“judgments.”…Are those judgments slight ones? They are great ones,
severe, hard to bear; but would they were all. “Deep calls to deep with
the voice of Thy water-spouts,” in that Thou threatenest, Thou sayest,
that there is another condemnation in store even after those sufferings.
“Deep calls on deep with the voice of Thy water-spouts.” “Whither then
shall I go from Thy presence? And whither shall I flee from Thy Spirit?”
seeing that deep calls to deep, and after those sufferings severer ones
are to be dreaded.

<span id="ii.XLII-p80"></span>14. “All Thy overhangings <span
id="fr_1265"></span>[1266](#fn_1265.md) and Thy waves are come upon me.”
The “waves” in what I already feel, the “overhangings” in that Thou
denouncest. All my sufferings are Thy waves; all Thy denouncements of
judgments are Thy “overhangings.” In the “waves” that deep “calleth;” in
the “overhangings” is the other “deep” which it “calls to.” In this that
I suffer are all Thy waves; in the severer punishment that Thou
threatenest, all Thy “overhangings” are come unto me. For He who
threatens does not let His judgments fall upon us, but keeps them
suspended over us. <span id="fr_1266"></span>[1267](#fn_1266.md) But
inasmuch as Thou sittest at liberty, I have thus spoken unto my soul.
“Hope in God: for I will confess unto Him. My God is the saving health
of my countenance.” The more numerous my sufferings, the sweeter will be
Thy mercy.

<span id="ii.XLII-p83"></span>15. Therefore follows: “The Lord will
commend His loving-kindness in the day-time; and in the night-time will
He declare it” <span id="fr_1267"></span>[1268](#fn_1267.md) ([Psa.
42.8](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#008)<span id="ii.XLII-p84.1"></span>.md).
In tribulation no man has leisure to hear: attend, when it is well with
you; hear, when it is well with you; learn, when you are in
tranquillity, the discipline of wisdom, and store up the word of God as
you do food. For in tribulation every one must be profited by what he
heard in the time of security. For in prosperity God “commends to thee
His mercy,” in case thou serve Him faithfully, for He frees thee from
tribulation; but it is “in the night” only that He “declares” His mercy
to thee, which He “commended” to thee by day. When tribulation shall
actually come, He will not leave thee destitute of His help; He will
show thee <span id="page_137">p. 137</span> <span
id="ii.XLII-Page_137"></span>that which He commended to thee in the
daytime is true. For it is written in a certain passage, “The mercy of
the Lord is seasonable <span id="fr_1268"></span>[1269](#fn_1268.md) in the
time of affliction, as clouds of rain in the time of drought.” “The Lord
hath commended His loving-kindness in the day-time, and in the night
will He declare it.” He does not show that He is thine Helper, unless
tribulation come, from whence thou must be rescued by Him who promised
it to thee “in the day-time.” Therefore we are warned to be like “the
ant.” For just as worldly prosperity is signified by “the day,”
adversity by the night, so again in another way worldly prosperity is
expressed by “the summer,” adversity by the winter. And what is it that
the ant does? She lays up in summer what will be useful to her in
winter. Whilst therefore it is summer, whilst it is well with you,
whilst you are in tranquillity, hear the word of the Lord. For how can
it be that in the midst of these tempests of the world, you should pass
through the whole of that sea, without suffering? How could it happen?
To what mortal’s lot has it fallen? If even it has been the lot of any,
that very calm is more to be dreaded. “The Lord hath commended His
loving-kindness in the day-time, and in the night-time will He declare
it.”…“There is with me prayer unto the God of my life.” This I make my
business here; I who am the “hart thirsting and longing for the
water-brooks,” calling to mind the sweetness of that strain, by which I
was led on through the tabernacle even to the house of God; whilst this
“corruptible body presseth down the soul,”  <span
id="fr_1269"></span>[1270](#fn_1269.md) there is yet with me “prayer unto
the God of my life.” For in order to making supplication unto God, I
have not to buy aught from places beyond the sea; or in order that He
may hear me, have I to sail to bring from a distance frankincense and
perfumes, or have I to bring “calf or ram from the flock.” There is
“with me prayer to the God of my life.” I have within a victim to
sacrifice; I have within an incense to place on the altar; I have within
a sacrifice wherewith to propitiate my God. “The sacrifice of God is a
troubled spirit.” What sacrifice of a “troubled spirit” I have within,
hear.

<span id="ii.XLII-p87"></span>16. “I will say unto God, Thou art my
lifter up. Why hast Thou forgotten me?” ([Psa.
42.9](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#009)<span id="ii.XLII-p87.1"></span>.md).
For I am suffering here, even as if Thou hadst forgotten me. But Thou
art trying me, and I know that Thou dost but put off, not take utterly
from me, what Thou hast promised me. But yet, “Why hast Thou forgotten
me?” So cried our Head also, as if speaking in our name. “My God, my
God, why hast Thou forsaken me?”  <span
id="fr_1270"></span>[1271](#fn_1270.md) I will say unto God, “Thou art my
lifter up; why hast Thou forgotten me?”

<span id="ii.XLII-p89"></span>17. “Why hast Thou rejected me?” <span
id="fr_1271"></span>[1272](#fn_1271.md) “Rejected” me, that is to say, from
that height of the apprehension of the unchangeable Truth. “Why hast
Thou rejected me?” Why, when already longing for those things, have I
been cast down to these, by the weight <span
id="fr_1272"></span>[1273](#fn_1272.md) and burden of my iniquity? This
same voice in another passage said, “I said in my trance” <span
id="fr_1273"></span>[1274](#fn_1273.md) (i.e., in my rapture, when he had
seen some great thing or other), “I said in my trance, I am cast out of
the sight of Thine eyes.” For he compared these things in which he found
himself, to those toward which he had been raised; and saw himself cast
out far “from the sight of God’s eyes,” as he speaks even here, “Why
hast Thou rejected me? Why go I mourning, while mine enemy troubleth me,
while he breaketh my bones?” Even he, my tempter, the devil; while
offences are everywhere on the increase, because of the abundance of
which “the love of many is waxing cold.” <span
id="fr_1274"></span>[1275](#fn_1274.md) When we see the strong members of
the Church generally giving way to the causes of offence, does not
Christ’s body say, “The enemy breaketh my bones”? For it is the strong
members that are “the bones;” and sometimes even those that are strong
sink under their temptations. For whosoever of the body of Christ
considers this, does he not exclaim, with the voice of Christ’s Body,
“Why hast Thou rejected me? Why go I mourning, while mine enemy
troubleth me, while he breaketh my bones?”

<span id="ii.XLII-p94"></span>You may see not my flesh merely, but even
my “bones.” To see those who were thought to have some stability, giving
way under temptations, so that the rest of the weak brethren despair
when they see those who are strong succumbing; how great, my brethren,
are the dangers!

<span id="ii.XLII-p95"></span>18. “They who trouble me cast me in the
teeth.” Again that voice! “While they say daily unto me, Where is thy
God?” ([Psa. 42.10](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#010.md)<span
id="ii.XLII-p95.1"></span>). And it is principally in the temptations of
the Church they say this, “Where is thy God?” How much was this cast in
the teeth of the Martyrs! Those men so patient and courageous for the
name of Christ, how often was it said to them, “Where is your God?” “Let
Him deliver you, if He can.” For men saw their torments outwardly; they
did not inwardly behold their crowns! “They who trouble me cast me in
the teeth, while they say daily unto me, Where is thy God?” And on this
account, seeing “my soul is disquieted on account of myself,” what else
should I say unto it than those words:

<span id="ii.XLII-p96"></span>“Why art thou cast down, O my soul; and
why dost thou disquiet me?” ([Psa.
42.11](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#011.md)<span
id="ii.XLII-p96.1"></span>). And, as <span id="page_138">p. 138</span>
<span id="ii.XLII-Page_138"></span>it seems to answer, “Wouldest thou
not have me disquiet thee, placed as I am here in so great evils?
Wouldest thou have me not disquiet thee, panting as I am after what is
good, thirsting and labouring as I am for it?” What should I say, but,

<span id="ii.XLII-p97"></span>“Hope thou in God; for I will yet confess
unto Him” ([Psa. 42.11](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#011.md)<span
id="ii.XLII-p97.1"></span>). He states the very words of that
confession; he repeats the grounds on which he fortifies his hope. “He
is the health of my countenance, and my God.”
