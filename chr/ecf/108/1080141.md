<span id="ii.CXIX.xi"></span>

<span id="ii.CXIX.xi-p1"></span> *<span class="c2"><span
id="ii.CXIX.xi-p1.1"></span>Caph.</span>*

<span id="ii.CXIX.xi-p2"></span>81. “My soul hath failed for Thy
salvation: and I have hoped because of Thy word” ([Psa.
119.81](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#081.md)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xi-p2.1"></span>). It is not every failing that should be
supposed to be blameable or deserving punishment: there is also a
failing that is laudable or desirable.…For it is said of a good failing:
“My soul hath a desire and failing to enter into the courts of the
Lord.” <span id="fr_5244"></span>[5245](#fn_5244.md) So also here he saith
not, faileth away from Thy salvation, but “faileth for Thy salvation,”
that is, towards Thy salvation. This losing ground is therefore good:
for it doth indicate a longing after good, not as yet indeed gained, but
most eagerly and earnestly desired. But who saith this, save the chosen
generation, the royal priesthood, the holy nation, the peculiar
people, <span id="fr_5245"></span>[5246](#fn_5245.md) longing for Christ
from the origin of the human race even unto the end of this world, in
the persons of those who, each in his own time, have lived, are living,
or are to live here?…The first seasons of the Church, therefore, had
Saints, before the Virgin’s delivery, who desired the advent of His
Incarnation: but these times, since He hath ascended into heaven, have
Saints who desire His manifestation to judge the quick and the
dead.…“And I have hoped because of Thy word:” that is, of Thy promise; a
hope which causeth us to await with patience that which is not seen by
those who believe. Here also the Greek hath the word <span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.CXIX.xi-p4.2"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.CXIX.xi-p4.3"></span>πήλπισα</span>, which
some of our translators have preferred rendering by, “hoped-more;” since
beyond doubt it will be greater than can be described.

<span id="ii.CXIX.xi-p5"></span>82. “Mine eyes,” he saith, “have failed
for Thy word, saying, O when wilt Thou comfort me?” ([Psa.
119.82](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#082.md)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xi-p5.1"></span>). Behold that praiseworthy and blessed
failing, in the eyes again, but his inner eyes, not arising from
infirmity of mind, but from the strength of his longing for the promise
of God: for this he saith, “for Thy <span id="page_574">p. 574</span>
<span id="ii.CXIX.xi-Page_574"></span>word.” But in what sense can such
eyes say, “When wilt Thou comfort me?” save when we pray and groan with
such earnestness and ardent expectation? For the tongue, not the eyes,
is wont to speak: but in some sense the voice of the eyes is the longing
of prayer. But in the words, “When wilt Thou comfort me?” he showeth
that he endureth as it were delay. Whence is this also, “How long, Lord,
wilt Thou punish me?” <span id="fr_5246"></span>[5247](#fn_5246.md) And
this is done either that the happiness may be the sweeter when deferred,
or this is the sentiment of those who long, since the space of time,
which may be short to Him who cometh to their aid, is tedious to the
loving. But God knoweth what He doth and when, for He “hath ordered all
things in measure and number and weight.” <span
id="fr_5247"></span>[5248](#fn_5247.md)

<span id="ii.CXIX.xi-p8"></span>83. But when spiritual desires burn,
carnal desires without doubt cool: on this account followeth, “Since I
am become like a bottle in the frost, I do not forget Thy
righteousnesses” ([Psa. 119.83](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#083.md)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xi-p8.1"></span>). Truly he desireth this mortal flesh to be
understood by the bottle, the heavenly blessing by the frost, whereby
the lusts of the flesh as it were by the binding of the frost become
sluggish; and hence it ariseth that the righteousnesses of God do not
slip from the memory, as long as we do not meditate apart from them;
since what the Apostle saith is brought to pass: “Make not provision for
the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.”  <span
id="fr_5248"></span>[5249](#fn_5248.md) “And I do not forget Thy
righteousness:” that is, I forget them not, because I have become such.
For the fervour of lust hath cooled, that the memory of love might glow.

<span id="ii.CXIX.xi-p10"></span>84. “How many are the days of Thy
servant? when wilt Thou be avenged of them that persecute me?” ([Psa.
119.84](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#084.md)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xi-p10.1"></span>). In the Apocalypse, <span
id="fr_5249"></span>[5250](#fn_5249.md) these are the words of the Martyrs,
and long-suffering is enjoined them until the number of their brethren
be fulfilled. The body of Christ then is asking concerning its days,
what they are to be in this world, and that no man might suppose that
the Church would cease to exist here before the end of the world came,
and that some time would elapse in this world, while the Church was now
no more on earth; therefore, when he had enquired concerning the days,
he added also respecting the judgment, showing indeed that the Church
would exist on earth until the judgment, when vengeance shall fall upon
Her persecutors. But if any one wonder why he should ask that question,
to which when asked by the disciples, their Master replied, “It is not
for you to know the times and the seasons;” <span
id="fr_5250"></span>[5251](#fn_5250.md) why should we not believe that in
this passage of the Psalm it was prophesied that they should ask this
very question, and that the words of the Church, which were so long
before uttered here, were fulfilled in their question?

<span id="ii.CXIX.xi-p13"></span>85. In what followeth: “The wicked have
told me pleasant tales: but not like Thy law, O Lord” ([Psa.
119.85](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#085.md)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xi-p13.1"></span>): the Latin translators have endeavoured
to render the Greek <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.CXIX.xi-p13.2"></span>‡</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.CXIX.xi-p13.3"></span>δολεσχίας</span>, which cannot be expressed
in one Latin word, so that some have rendered it “delights,” and others
“fablings,” so that we must understand to be meant some kind of
compositions, but in discourse of a nature to give pleasure. Both
secular literature, and the Jewish book entitled Deuterosis, <span
id="fr_5251"></span>[5252](#fn_5251.md) containing besides the canon of
divine Scripture thousands of tales, comprise these in their different
sects and professions; the vain and wandering loquacity of heretics
holds them also. All these he wished to be considered as wicked, by whom
he saith that <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.CXIX.xi-p14.4"></span>‡</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.CXIX.xi-p14.5"></span>δολεσχίαι</span> were related to him, that
is, compositions which gave pleasure solely in their style: “But not,”
he addeth, “as Thy law, O Lord;” because truth, not words, pleases me
therein. <span id="fr_5252"></span>[5253](#fn_5252.md)

<span id="ii.CXIX.xi-p16"></span>86. Lastly, he addeth, “All Thy
commandments are truth: they have persecuted me unjustly; O be Thou my
help” ([Psa. 119.86](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#086.md)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xi-p16.1"></span>). And the whole sense dependeth upon the
foregoing: “How many are the days of Thy servant: when wilt Thou be
avenged of them that persecute me?” <span
id="fr_5253"></span>[5254](#fn_5253.md) For that they may persecute me,
they have related to me these pleasant tales; but I have preferred Thy
law to them, which on that account hath pleased me more, because all Thy
commandments are true; not as in their discourses, where vanity
aboundeth. And for this reason “they have persecuted me falsely,”
because in me they have persecuted nothing save the truth. Therefore
help Thou me, that I may struggle for the truth even unto death; because
this is at once Thy commandment, and therefore it is also the truth.

<span id="ii.CXIX.xi-p18"></span>87. When the Church acted thus, She
suffered what he hath added, “They had almost made an end of me upon
earth” ([Psa. 119.87](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#087.md)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xi-p18.1"></span>): a great slaughter of martyrs having been
made, while they confess and preach the truth. But since it is not in
vain said, “O help Thou me;” he addeth, “But I forsook not Thy
commandments.”

<span id="ii.CXIX.xi-p19"></span>88. And that She might persevere unto
the end, “O quicken me,” he saith, “after Thy loving mercy: and so shall
I keep the testimonies of Thy mouth” ([Psa.
119.88](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#088.md)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xi-p19.1"></span>); where the Greek hath <span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.CXIX.xi-p19.2"></span>Μαρτύρια</span>. This
was not to be passed over in silence, on account of that sweetest name
of Martyrs, who beyond doubt when so great cruelty of the persecutors
was raging, that the Church <span id="page_575">p. 575</span> <span
id="ii.CXIX.xi-Page_575"></span>was almost made an end of upon earth,
would never have kept the testimonies of God, unless that had been
vouchsafed them which is here spoken of, “O quicken me after Thy
loving-kindness.” For they were quickened, lest by loving life, they
should deny the life, and by denying it, should lose it: and thus they
who for life refused to forsake the truth, lived by dying for the truth.
