<span id="ii.XII"></span>

<span id="ii.XII-p1"></span> <span id="ii.XII-p1.1"></span><span
class="c20"><span id="ii.XII-p1.2"></span>Psalm XII. <span
id="fr_457"></span>[458](#fn_457.md) </span>

<span id="ii.XII-p3"></span>To the end, for the eighth, a psalm of
David.

<span id="ii.XII-p4"></span>1. It has been said on the sixth
Psalm, <span id="fr_458"></span>[459](#fn_458.md) that “the eighth” may be
taken as the day of judgment. “For the eighth” may also be taken “for
the eternal age;” for that after the time present, which is a cycle of
seven days, it shall be given to the Saints.

<span id="ii.XII-p6"></span>2. “Save me, O Lord, for the holy hath
failed;” that is, is not found: as we speak when we say, Corn fails, or,
Money fails. “For the truths have been minished from among the sons of
men” ([Psa. 12.1](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#001.md)<span
id="ii.XII-p6.1"></span>). The truth is one, whereby holy souls are
enlightened: but forasmuch as there are many souls, there may be said in
them to be many truths: as in mirrors there are seen many reflections
from one face.

<span id="ii.XII-p7"></span>3. “He hath talked vanity each man to his
neighbour” ([Psa. 12.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#002.md)<span
id="ii.XII-p7.1"></span>). By neighbour we must understand every man:
for that there is no one with whom we should work evil; “and the love of
our neighbour worketh no evil.” <span id="fr_459"></span>[460](#fn_459.md)
“Deceitful lips, with a heart and a heart they have spoken evil
things.” <span id="fr_460"></span>[461](#fn_460.md) The repetition, “with a
heart and a heart,” signifies a double heart.

<span id="ii.XII-p10"></span>4. “May the Lord destroy all deceitful
lips” ([Psa. 12.3](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#003.md)<span
id="ii.XII-p10.1"></span>). He says “all,” that no one may suppose
himself excepted: as the Apostle says, “Upon every soul of man that
doeth evil, of the Jew first, and of the Greek.” <span
id="fr_461"></span>[462](#fn_461.md) “The tongue speaking great things:”
the proud tongue.

<span id="ii.XII-p12"></span>5. “Who have said, We will magnify our
tongue, our lips are our own, who is Lord over us?” ([Psa.
12.4](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#004)<span id="ii.XII-p12.1"></span>.md).
Proud hypocrites are meant, putting confidence in their speech to
deceive men, and not submitting themselves to God.

<span id="ii.XII-p13"></span>6. “Because of the wretchedness of the
needy and the sighing of the poor, now I will arise, saith the
Lord” <span id="fr_462"></span>[463](#fn_462.md) ([Psa.
12.5](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#005)<span id="ii.XII-p14.1"></span>.md).
For so the Lord Himself in the Gospel pitied His people, because they
had no ruler, when they could well obey. Whence too it is said in the
Gospel, “The har<span id="page_45">p. 45</span> <span
id="ii.XII-Page_45"></span>vest is plenteous, but the labourers are
few.” <span id="fr_463"></span>[464](#fn_463.md) But this must be taken as
spoken in the person of God the Father, who, because of the needy and
the poor, that is, who in need and poverty were lacking spiritual good
things, vouchsafed to send His own Son. From thence begins His sermon on
the mount to Matthew, where He says, “Blessed are the poor in spirit:
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.” <span
id="fr_464"></span>[465](#fn_464.md) “I will place in salvation.” He does
not say what He would place: but, “in salvation,” must be understood as,
in Christ; according to that, “For mine eyes have seen Thy
salvation.” <span id="fr_465"></span>[466](#fn_465.md) And hence He is
understood to have placed in Him what appertains to the taking away the
wretchedness of the needy, and the comforting the sighing of the poor.
“I will deal confidently in Him:” according to that in the Gospel, “For
He taught them as one having authority, and not as their scribes.” <span
id="fr_466"></span>[467](#fn_466.md)

<span id="ii.XII-p19"></span>7. “The words of the Lord” are “pure words”
([Psa. 12.6](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#006.md)<span
id="ii.XII-p19.1"></span>). This is in the person of the Prophet
himself, “The words of the Lord” are “pure words.” He says “pure,”
without the alloy of pretence. For many preach the truth impurely; <span
id="fr_467"></span>[468](#fn_467.md) for they sell it for the bribe of the
advantages of this life. Of such the Apostle says, that they declared
Christ not purely. “Silver tried by the fire for the earth.” <span
id="fr_468"></span>[469](#fn_468.md) These words of the Lord by means of
tribulations approved to sinners. “Purified seven times:” by the fear of
God, by godliness, by knowledge, by might, by counsel, by understanding,
by wisdom. <span id="fr_469"></span>[470](#fn_469.md) For seven steps also
of beatitude there are, which the Lord goes over, according to Matthew,
in the same sermon which He spake on the Mount, “Blessed” are “the poor
in spirit, blessed the meek, blessed they that mourn, blessed they which
do hunger and thirst after righteousness, blessed the merciful, blessed
the pure in heart, blessed the peacemakers.” <span
id="fr_470"></span>[471](#fn_470.md) Of which seven sentences, it may be
observed how all that long sermon was spoken. For the eighth where it is
said, “Blessed” are “they which suffer persecution for righteousness’
sake,” <span id="fr_471"></span>[472](#fn_471.md) denotes the fire itself,
whereby the silver is proved seven times. And at the termination of this
sermon it is said, “For He taught them as one having authority, and not
as their scribes.” <span id="fr_472"></span>[473](#fn_472.md) Which refers
to that which is said in this Psalm, “I deal confidently in Him.”

<span id="ii.XII-p26"></span>8. “Thou, O Lord, shalt preserve us, and
keep us from this generation to eternity” ([Psa.
12.7](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#007)<span id="ii.XII-p26.1"></span>.md):
here as needy and poor, there as wealthy and rich.

<span id="ii.XII-p27"></span>9. “The ungodly walk in a circle round
about” ([Psa. 12.8](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#008.md)<span
id="ii.XII-p27.1"></span>): that is, in the desire of things temporal,
which revolves as a wheel in a repeated circle of seven days; and
therefore they do not arrive at the eighth, that is, at eternity, for
which this Psalm is entitled. <span id="fr_473"></span>[474](#fn_473.md) So
too it is said by Solomon, “For the wise king is the winnower of the
ungodly, and he bringeth on them the wheel of the wicked.—After Thine
height Thou hast multiplied the sons of men.” <span
id="fr_474"></span>[475](#fn_474.md) For there is in temporal things too a
multiplication, which turns away from the unity of God. Hence “the
corruptible body weigheth down the soul, and the earthy tabernacle
presseth down the mind that museth upon many things.” <span
id="fr_475"></span>[476](#fn_475.md) But the righteous are multiplied
“after the height of God,” when “they shall go from strength to
strength.” <span id="fr_476"></span>[477](#fn_476.md)
