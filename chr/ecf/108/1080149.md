<span id="ii.CXIX.xix"></span>

<span id="ii.CXIX.xix-p1"></span> *<span class="c2"><span
id="ii.CXIX.xix-p1.1"></span>Koph.</span>*

<span id="ii.CXIX.xix-p2"></span>143. …He who singeth this Psalm,
mentioneth such a prayer of his own: “I have called with my whole heart;
hear me, O Lord!” ([Psa. 119.145](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#145)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xix-p2.1"></span>). For to what end his cry profiteth, he
addeth: “I will search out Thy righteousnesses.” For this purpose then
he hath called with his whole heart, and hath longed that this might be
given him by the Lord listening unto him, that he may search out His
righteousnesses…

<span id="ii.CXIX.xix-p3"></span>144. “I have called, save me” ([Psa.
119.146](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#146)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xix-p3.1"></span>) or as some copies, both Greek and Latin,
have it, “I have called to Thee.” But what is, “I have called to Thee,”
save that by calling I have invoked Thee? But when he had said, “save
me;” what did he add? “And I will keep Thy testimonies:” that is, that I
may not, through infirmity, deny Thee. For the health of the soul
causeth that to be done which it is known to be our duty to do, and thus
in striving even to the death of the body, if the extremity of
temptation demand this in defence of the truth of the divine
testimonies: but where there is not health of the soul, weakness
yieldeth, and truth is deserted…

<span id="ii.CXIX.xix-p4"></span>145. “I have prevented in midnight,” he
saith, “and have cried: In Thy words have I trusted” ([Psa.
119.147](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#147)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xix-p4.1"></span>). If we refer this to each of the
faithful, and to the literal character of the act; it oft happeneth that
the love of God is awake in that hour of the night, and, the love of
prayer strongly urging us, the time of prayer, which is wont to be after
the crowing of the cock, is not awaited, but prevented. But if we
understand night of the whole of this world’s duration; we indeed cry
unto God at midnight, and prevent the fulness of time in which He will
restore us what He hath promised, as is elsewhere read, “Let us prevent
His presence with confession.” <span
id="fr_5338"></span>[5339](#fn_5338) Although if we choose to understand
the unripe season of this night, before the fulness of time had
come, <span id="fr_5339"></span>[5340](#fn_5339) that is, the ripe
season when Christ should be manifested in the flesh; neither was the
Church then silent, but preventing this fulness of time, in prophecy
cried out, and trusted in the words of God, who was able to do what He
promised, that in the seed of Abraham all nations should be
blessed. <span id="fr_5340"></span>[5341](#fn_5340)

<span id="ii.CXIX.xix-p8"></span>146. The Church saith also what
followeth, “Mine eyes have prevented the morning watch, that I might
meditate on Thy words” ([Psa.
119.148](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#148)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xix-p8.1"></span>). Let us suppose the morning to mean the
season when “a light arose for them that sat in the shadow of
death;” <span id="fr_5341"></span>[5342](#fn_5341) did not the eyes of
the Church prevent this morning watch, in those Saints who before were
on earth, because they foresaw beforehand that this would come to pass,
so that they meditated on the words of God, which then were, and
announced these things to be destined in the Law and the Prophets?

<span id="ii.CXIX.xix-p10"></span>147. “Hear my voice, O Lord, according
to Thy loving-mercy; and quicken Thou me according to Thy judgment”
([Psa. 119.149](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#149)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xix-p10.1"></span>). For first God according to His
loving-mercy taketh away punishment from sinners, and will give them
life afterwards, when righteous, according to His judgment; for it is
not without a meaning that it is said unto Him, “My song shall be of
mercy and judgment: unto Thee, O Lord;” <span
id="fr_5342"></span>[5343](#fn_5342) in this order of the terms:
although the season of mercy itself be not without judgment, whereof the
Apostle saith, “If we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged of
the Lord.” <span id="fr_5343"></span>[5344](#fn_5343) …And the final
season of judgment shall not be without mercy, since as the Psalm saith,
“He crowneth thee with mercy and loving-kindness.” But “judgment shall
be without mercy,” but “unto those” on the left, “who have not dealt
mercy.” <span id="fr_5344"></span>[5345](#fn_5344)

<span id="ii.CXIX.xix-p14"></span><span id="page_585">p. 585</span>
<span id="ii.CXIX.xix-Page_585"></span>148. “They draw nigh, that of
malice persecute me:” or, as some copies read, “maliciously” ([Psa.
119.150](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#150)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xix-p14.1"></span>). Then they that persecute draw nigh,
when they go the length of torturing and destroying the flesh: whence
the twenty-first Psalm, wherein the Lord’s Passion is prophesied, saith,
“O go not from me, for trouble is hard at hand;” <span
id="fr_5345"></span>[5346](#fn_5345) where those things are spoken of
which He suffered when His Passion was not imminent upon Him, but
actually realized. “And are far from Thy law.” The nearer they drew to
the persecuting the righteous, so much the farther were they from
righteousness. But what harm did they do unto those, to whom they drew
near by persecution; since the approach of their Lord is nearer unto
their souls, by whom they no wise are forsaken?

<span id="ii.CXIX.xix-p16"></span>149. Lastly, it followeth, “Thou art
nigh at hand, O Lord, and all Thy ways are truth” ([Psa.
119.151](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#151)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xix-p16.1"></span>). Even in their troubles, it hath been a
wonted confession of the saints, to ascribe truth unto God, because they
suffer them not undeservedly. So did Queen Esther, <span
id="fr_5346"></span>[5347](#fn_5346) so did holy Daniel, <span
id="fr_5347"></span>[5348](#fn_5347) so did the three men in the
furnace, <span id="fr_5348"></span>[5349](#fn_5348) so do other
associates in their sanctity confess. But it may be asked, in what sense
it is here said, “All Thy ways are truth;” since in another Psalm it is
read, “All the ways of the Lord are mercy and truth.” <span
id="fr_5349"></span>[5350](#fn_5349) But towards the saints, All the
ways of the Lord are at once mercy and truth: since He aideth them even
in judgment, and thus mercy is not wanting; and in having mercy upon
them, He performeth that which He hath promised, so that truth is not
wanting. But towards all, both those whom He freeth, and those whom He
condemneth, all the ways of the Lord are mercy and truth; because where
He doth not show mercy, the truth of His vengeance is displayed. For He
freeth many who have not deserved, but He condemneth none who hath not
deserved it.

<span id="ii.CXIX.xix-p21"></span>150. “From the beginning I have
known,” he saith, “as concerning Thy testimonies, that Thou hast
grounded them for ever” <span id="fr_5350"></span>[5351](#fn_5350)
([Psa. 119.152](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#152)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xix-p22.3"></span>)…What are these testimonies, save those
wherein God hath declared that He will give an everlasting kingdom unto
His sons? And since He hath declared that He will give this in His
only-begotten Son, he said that the testimonies themselves were grounded
for ever. For that which God hath promised through them, was
everlasting. And for this reason the words, “Thou hast grounded them,”
are rightly thus understood, because they are shown to be true in
Christ. <span id="fr_5351"></span>[5352](#fn_5351) Whence then did the
Psalmist know this in the beginning, save because the Church speaketh,
which was not wanting to the earth from the commencement of the human
race, the first-fruits whereof was the holy Abel, himself sacrificed in
testimony of the future blood of the Mediator that should be shed by a
wicked brother? <span id="fr_5352"></span>[5353](#fn_5352) For this also
was at the beginning, “They two shall be one flesh:” <span
id="fr_5353"></span>[5354](#fn_5353) which great mystery the Apostle
Paul expounding, saith, “I speak concerning Christ and the
Church.” <span id="fr_5354"></span>[5355](#fn_5354)
