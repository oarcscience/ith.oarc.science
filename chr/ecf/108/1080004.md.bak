<span id="ii.iii-p1"></span><span class="c20"><span
id="ii.iii-p1.1"></span>Advertisement.</span>

<span id="ii.iii-p2"></span><span class="c21"><span
id="ii.iii-p2.1"></span>It</span> seems necessary to give the following
outline of the history of this Oxford translation. It was undertaken as
part of the great series of original translations which appeared “under
the patronage of William, Archbishop of Canterbury, from its
commencement, <span class="c21"><span
id="ii.iii-p2.2"></span>a.d.</span> 1836, until his Grace’s departure in
peace, <span class="c21"><span id="ii.iii-p2.3"></span>a.d.</span>
1848.” It proposed to include all the “Fathers of the Holy Catholic
Church before the division of the East and West,” and this exposition
was dedicated as a memorial of Archbishop Howley in the following
words:—

<span id="ii.iii-p3"></span>“*To the memory of the most reverend father
in God, William, Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, Primate of all England,
formerly Regius Professor of Divinity in the University of Oxford, this
Library of ancient bishops, fathers, doctors, martyrs, confessors, of
Christ’s Holy Catholic Church, undertaken amid his encouragement, and
carried on for twelve years under his sanction, until his departure
hence in peace, is gratefully and reverently inscribed.*”

<span id="ii.iii-p4"></span>The preface to the first volume was by the
saintly <span class="c21"><span id="ii.iii-p4.1"></span>Charles
Marriott</span> of Oriel College, with whom I enjoyed some acquaintance.
It is well worth preserving here, <span id="fr_2"></span>[3](#fn_2.md) and
is as follows:—

<span id="ii.iii-p6"></span><span class="c21"><span
id="ii.iii-p6.1"></span>In</span> any commentary on a portion of the Old
Testament by a writer unacquainted with Hebrew, exact criticism, and
freedom from mistake, must not be expected. But the Psalms have been so
in the mouth and in the heart of God’s people in all languages, that it
has been necessary often to find an explanation suitable to imperfect
translations. And no doubt it is intended that we should use such
explanations for the purpose of edification, when we are unable to be
more accurate, though in proving doctrine it is necessary always to
remember and allow for any want of acquaintance with the original, or
uncertainty with respect to its actual meaning. However, the main scope
and bearing of the text is rarely affected by such points as vary in
different translations, and the analogy of the faith is sufficient to
prevent a Catholic <span id="fr_3"></span>[4](#fn_3.md) mind from adopting
any error in consequence of a text seeming to bear a heterodox meaning.
Perhaps the errors of translation in the existing versions may have led
the Fathers to adopt rules of interpretation ranging too far from the
simple and literal; but having such translations, they could hardly use
them otherwise. Meanwhile St. Augustin will be found to excel in the
intense apprehension of those great truths which pervade the whole of
Sacred Writ, and in the vivid and powerful exposition of what bears upon
them. It is hardly possible to read his practical and forcible
applications of Holy Scripture, without feeling those truths by the
faith of which we ought to live brought home to the heart in a wonderful
manner. His was a mind that strove earnestly to solve the great problems
of human life, and after exhausting the resources, and discovering the
emptiness, of erroneous systems, found truth and rest at last in
Catholic Christianity, in the religion of the Bible as expounded by St.
Ambrose. And though we must look to his *Confessions* for the full view
of all his cravings after real good, and their ultimate satisfaction,
yet throughout his works we have the benefit of the earnestness with
which he sought to feed on the “sincere milk of the word.”

<span id="ii.iii-p8"></span>His mystical and allegorical interpretation,
in spite of occasional mistakes, which belong rather to the translation
than to himself, will be found in general of great value. It is to a
considerable extent systematic, and the same interpretation of the same
symbols is repeated throughout the work, and is indeed often common to
him with other Fathers. The “feet” taken for the affections, “clouds”
for the Apostles, and many other instances, are of very frequent
occurrence. And it is evident that a few such general interpretations
must be a great help to those who wish to make an allegorical use of
those portions of Holy Scripture which are adapted for it. Nor are they
adhered to with such strictness as to deprive the reader of the benefit
of other explanations, where it appears that some other metaphor or
allegory was intended. Both St. Augustin and St. Gregory acknowledge,
and at times impress on their readers, that metaphorical language is
used in Holy Scripture with various meanings under the same symbol.

<span id="ii.iii-p9"></span>The discourses on the Psalms are not carried
throughout on the same plan, but still are tolerably complete as a
commentary, since the longer expositions furnish the means of filling
out the shorter notices, in thought at least, to the attentive reader of
the whole. They were not delivered continuously, nor all at the same
place. Occasionally the author is led by the circumstances of the time
into long discussions of a controversial character, especially with
respect to the Donatists, against whose narrow and exclusive views he
urges strongly the prophecies relating to the universality of the
Church. Occasionally a Psalm is first reviewed briefly, so as to give a
general clew to its interpretation, and then enlarged upon in several
discourses.

<span id="ii.iii-p10"></span>For the present translation, as far as the
first thirty Psalms, the editors are indebted to a friend who conceals
his name; for the remainder of the volume, with part of the next which
is to appear, to the Rev. <span class="c21"><span
id="ii.iii-p10.1"></span>J. E. Tweed, M.A.,</span> chaplain of Christ
Church, Oxford.

<span id="page_x">p. x</span> <span id="ii.iii-Page_x"></span>

<span id="ii.iii-p13"></span>After the first two volumes edited by Mr.
Tweed of Christ Church, the third volume (carrying the work down to the
end of [Psalm lxxv.](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#000.md)<span
id="ii.iii-p13.1"></span>) appeared with this announcement signed by Mr.
Marriott: “The whole of it, as well as a few Psalms at the end of the
former and the beginning of the following volume, is translated by <span
class="c21"><span id="ii.iii-p13.2"></span>T. Scratton,</span> Esq.,
M.A., of Christ Church, Oxford.” The fifth volume appeared in April,
1853, with the name of the Rev. <span class="c21"><span
id="ii.iii-p13.3"></span>H. M. Wilkins, M.A.,</span> of Merton College,
as translator. In December, 1857, came forth the last volume, with the
following advertisement from the pen of Dr. Pusey:—

<span id="ii.iii-p14"></span><span class="c21"><span
id="ii.iii-p14.1"></span>The</span> first hundred pages of this volume
were printed, when it pleased God to withdraw from all further toil our
friend, the Rev. C. Marriott, upon whose editorial labours the Library
of the Fathers had for some years wholly depended. Full of activity in
the cause of truth and religious knowledge, full of practical
benevolence, expanding himself, his strength, his paternal inheritance,
in works of piety and charity, in one night his labour was closed, and
he was removed from active duty to wait in stillness for his Lord’s last
call. His friends may perhaps rather thankfully wonder that God allowed
one, threatened in many ways with severe disease, to labour for Him so
long and so variously, than think it strange that He suddenly, and for
them prematurely, allowed him thus far to enter into his rest. To those
who knew him best, it has been a marvel how, with heath so frail, he was
enabled in such various ways, and for so many years, to do active good
in his generation. Early called, and ever obeying the call, he has been
allowed both active duty and an early rest.

<span id="ii.iii-p15"></span>This volume, long delayed, has been
completed by the Rev. <span class="c21"><span
id="ii.iii-p15.1"></span>H. Walford,</span> Vice-Principal of St.
Edmund’s Hall. The principal of St. Edmund Hall, Dr. Barrow, has, with
great kindness, allowed himself to be referred to in obscure passages.

<span id="ii.iii-p16"></span>St. Augustin’s Commentary on the Psalms,
then, is now, by the blessing of God, completed for the first time in an
English garb. Although, as a commentary, it from time to time fails us,
because it explains minutely and verbally a translation of Holy
Scripture different from and inferior to our own, yet, on this very
ground, it is the more valuable when the translations agree. For St.
Augustin was so impressed with the sense of the depth of Holy Scripture,
that when it seems to him, on the surface, plainest, then he is the more
assured of its hidden depth. <span id="fr_4"></span>[5](#fn_4.md) True to
this belief, St. Augustin pressed out word by word of Holy Scripture,
and that, always in dependence on the inward teaching of God the Holy
Ghost who wrote it, until he had extracted some fullness of meaning from
it. More also, perhaps, than any other work of St. Augustin, this
commentary abounds in those condensed statements of doctrinal and
practical truth which are so instructive, because at once so
comprehensive and so accurate.

<span id="ii.iii-p18"></span>May He under whose gracious influence this
great work was written, be with its readers also, and make it now, as
heretofore, a treasure to this portion of His Church.
