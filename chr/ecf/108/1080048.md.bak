<span id="ii.XLI-p1"></span> <span id="ii.XLI-p1.1"></span><span
class="c20"><span id="ii.XLI-p1.2"></span>Psalm XLI. <span
id="fr_1175"></span>[1176](#fn_1175.md) </span>

<span id="ii.XLI-p3"></span>To the people, on the Feast of the Martyrs.

<span id="ii.XLI-p4"></span>1. The solemn day of the Martyrs hath
dawned; therefore to the glory of the Passion of Christ, the Captain of
Martyrs, who spared not Himself, ordering His soldiers to the fight; but
first fought, first conquered, that their fighting He might encourage by
His example, and aid with His majesty, and crown with His promise: let
us hear somewhat from this Psalm pertaining to His Passion. I commend
unto you oftentimes, nor grieve I to repeat, what for you is useful to
retain, that our Lord Jesus Christ speaketh often of Himself, that is,
in His own Person, which is our Head; often in the person of His Body,
which are we and His Church; but so that the words sound as from the
mouth of one, that we may understand the Head and the Body to consist
together in the unity of integrity, and not be separated the one from
the other; as in that marriage whereof it is said, “They two shall be
one flesh.” <span id="fr_1176"></span>[1177](#fn_1176.md) If then we
acknowledge two in one flesh, let us acknowledge two in one voice.
First, that which responding to the reader <span
id="fr_1177"></span>[1178](#fn_1177.md) we have sung, though it be from the
middle of the Psalm, from that I will take the beginning of this Sermon.

<span id="ii.XLI-p7"></span>“Mine enemies speak evil of Me, When He
shall die, then shall His Name perish” ([Psa.
41.5](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#005)<span id="ii.XLI-p7.1"></span>.md).
This is the Person of our Lord Jesus Christ: but see if herein are not
understood the members also. This was spoken also when our Lord Himself
walked in the flesh here on earth.…When they saw the people go after
Him, they said, “When He shall die, then shall His Name perish;” that
is, when we have slain Him, then shall His Name be no more in the earth,
nor shall He seduce any, being dead; but by that very slaying of Him
shall men understand, that He was but a man whom they followed, that
there was in Him no hope of salvation, and shall desert His Name, and it
shall no more be. He died, and His Name perished not, but His Name was
sown as seed: He died, but He was a grain, which dying, the corn
immediately sprang up. <span id="fr_1178"></span>[1179](#fn_1178.md) When
glorified then was our Lord Jesus Christ, began they much more, and much
more numerously to trust in Him; then began His members to hear what the
Head had heard. Now then our Lord Jesus Christ being in heaven set down,
and Himself in us labouring on earth, still spake His enemies, “When He
shall die, then shall His Name perish.” For hence stirred up the devil
persecutions in the Church to destroy the Name of Christ. Unless haply
ye think, brethren, that those Pagans, when they raged against
Christians, said not this among themselves, “to blot out the Name of
Christ from the earth.” That Christ might die again, not in the Head,
but in His Body, were slain also the Martyrs. To the multiplying of the
Church availed the Holy Blood poured forth, to help Its seminating came
also the death of the Martyrs. “Precious in the sight of the Lord is the
death of His Saints.” <span id="fr_1179"></span>[1180](#fn_1179.md) More
and more were the Christians multiplied, nor was it fulfilled which
spake the enemies, “When He shall die, then shall His Name perish.” Even
now also is it spoken. Down sit the Pagans, and compute them the years,
they hear their fanatics <span id="fr_1180"></span>[1181](#fn_1180.md)
saying, A time shall come when Christians shall be none, and those idols
must be worshipped as before they were worshipped: still say they, “When
He shall die, then shall His Name perish.” Twice conquered, now the
third time be wise! Christ died, His Name has not perished: the Martyrs
died, multiplied more is the Church, groweth through all nations the
Name of Christ. He who foretold of His own Death, and of His
Resurrection, He who foretold of His Martyrs’ death, and of their crown,
He Himself foretold of His Church things yet to come, if truth He spake
twice, has He the third time lied? Vain then is what ye be<span
id="page_129">p. 129</span> <span id="ii.XLI-Page_129"></span>lieve
against Him; better is it that ye believe in Him, that ye may
“understand upon the needy and poor One;” <span
id="fr_1181"></span>[1182](#fn_1181.md) that “though He was rich, yet for
your sakes He became poor, that ye through His poverty might be
rich.” <span id="fr_1182"></span>[1183](#fn_1182.md) …

<span id="ii.XLI-p13"></span>2. “Blessed is he that understandeth upon
the needy and poor One: in the evil day shall the Lord deliver him”
([Psa. 41.1](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#001.md)<span
id="ii.XLI-p13.1"></span>). For the evil day will come: will thou, nill
thou, come it will: the Day of Judgment will come upon thee, an evil day
if thou “understand not the needy and poor.” For what now thou wilt not
believe, shall be made manifest in the end. But neither shalt thou
escape, when it shall be made manifest, because thou believest not, when
it is kept secret. Invited art thou, what thou seest not to believe,
lest when thou see, thou be put to the blush. “Understand then upon the
needy and poor One,” that is, Christ: understand in Him the hidden
riches, whom poor thou seest. “In Him are hid all the treasures of
wisdom and knowledge.” <span id="fr_1183"></span>[1184](#fn_1183.md) For
thereby in the evil day shall He deliver thee, in that He is God: but in
that He is man, and that which in Him is human hath raised to life, and
changed for the better, He hath lifted (thee <span
id="fr_1184"></span>[1185](#fn_1184) .md) to heaven. But He who is God, who
would have one person in man and with man, could neither decrease nor
increase, neither die nor rise again. He died out of man’s infirmity,
but God dieth not.…But as we rightly say, Such a man died, though his
soul dieth not; so we rightly say, Christ died, though His Divinity
dieth not. Wherefore died? Because needy and poor. Let not His death
offend thee, and avert thee from beholding His Divinity. “Blessed is he
that understandeth upon the needy and poor One.” Consider also the poor,
the needy, the hungry and thirsty, the naked, the sick, the prisoners;
understand also upon such poor, for if upon such thou understand, thou
understandest upon Him who said, “I was an hungred, I was thirsty, I was
a stranger, naked, sick, in prison;” <span
id="fr_1185"></span>[1186](#fn_1185.md) so in the evil day shall the Lord
deliver thee.…

<span id="ii.XLI-p17"></span>3. “And deliver him not into the hand of
his enemy” ([Psa. 41.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#002.md)<span
id="ii.XLI-p17.1"></span>). The enemy is the devil. Let none think of a
man his enemy, when he hears these words. Haply one thought of his
neighbour, of him who had a suit with him in court, of him who would
take from him his own possession, of him who would force him to sell to
him his house. Think not this; but that enemy think of, of whom said the
Lord, “an enemy hath done this.” <span
id="fr_1186"></span>[1187](#fn_1186.md) For He it is who suggests that for
things earthly he be worshipped, for overthrow the Christian Name this
enemy cannot. For he hath seen himself conquered by the fame and praises
of Christ, he hath seen, whereas he slew Christ’s Martyrs, that they are
crowned, he triumphed over. He hath begun to be unable to persuade men
that Christ is nought; and because by reviling Christ, he now with
difficulty deceives, by lauding Christ, he endeavours to deceive. Before
this what said he? Whom worship ye? A Jew, dead, crucified, a man of no
moment, who could not even from himself drive away death. When after His
Name he saw running the whole human race, saw that in the Name of the
Crucified temples are thrown down, idols are broken, sacrifices
abolished; and that all these things predicted in the Prophets are
considered by men, by men with wonder astonished, and closing now their
hearts against the reviling of Christ; he clothes himself with praise of
Christ, and begins to deter from the faith in another manner. Great is
the law of Christ, powerful is that law, divine, ineffable! but who
fulfilleth it? In the name of our Saviour, <span
id="fr_1187"></span>[1188](#fn_1187.md) “tread upon the lion and the
dragon.” <span id="fr_1188"></span>[1189](#fn_1188.md) By reviling openly
roared the lion; by lauding craftily lurks the dragon. Let them come to
the faith, who doubted; and not say, Who fulfilleth it? If on their own
strength they presume, they will not fulfil it. Presuming on the grace
of God let them believe, presuming (on it) let them come; to be aided
come, not to be judged. So live all the faithful in the Name of Christ,
each one in his degree fulfilling the commands of Christ, whether
married, or celibates and virgins, they live as much as God granteth
them to live; neither presume they in their own strength, but know that
in Him they ought to glory.…

<span id="ii.XLI-p21"></span>4. “The Lord help him” ([Psa.
41.3](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#003)<span id="ii.XLI-p21.1"></span>.md).
But when? Haply in heaven, haply in the life eternal, that so it remain
to worship the devil for earthly needs, for the necessities of this
life. Far be it! Thou hast “promise of the life that now is, and of that
which is to come.” <span id="fr_1189"></span>[1190](#fn_1189.md) He came
unto thee on earth, by Whom were made heaven and earth. Consider then
what He saith, “The Lord help him, on his bed of pain.” The bed of pain
is the infirmity of the flesh; lest thou shouldest say, I cannot hold,
and carry, and tie up my flesh; thou art aided that thou mayest. The
Lord help thee on thy bed of pain. Thy bed did carry thee, thou
carriedst not thy bed, but wast a paralytic inwardly; He cometh who
saith to thee, “Take up thy bed, and go thy way into thy house.” <span
id="fr_1190"></span>[1191](#fn_1190.md) “The Lord help him on his bed of
pain.” Then to the Lord Himself He turneth, as though it were
asked, <span id="fr_1191"></span>[1192](#fn_1191.md) Why then, since the
Lord helpeth us, suffer we such great ills in this life, such great
scandals, such great labours, such disquiet from the flesh <span
id="page_130">p. 130</span> <span id="ii.XLI-Page_130"></span>and the
world? He turneth to God, and as though explaining to us the counsel of
His healing, He saith, “Thou hast turned all his bed in his infirmity.”
By the bed is understood anything earthly. Every soul that is infirm in
this life seeketh for itself somewhat whereon to rest, because intensity
of labour, and of the soul extended toward God, it can hardly endure
perpetually, somewhat it seeketh on earth whereon to rest, and in a
manner with a kind of pausing to recline, as are those things which
innocent ones love.…The innocent man resteth in his house, his family,
his wife, his children; in his poverty, his little farm, his orchard
planted with his own hand, in some building fabricated with his own
study; in these rest the innocent. But yet God willing us not to have
love but of life eternal, even with these, though innocent delights,
mixeth bitterness, that even in these we may suffer tribulation, and so
He turneth all our bed in our infirmity. “Thou hast turned all his bed
in his infirmity.” Let him not then complain, when in these things which
he hath innocently, he suffereth some tribulations. He is taught to love
the better, by the bitterness of the worse; lest going a traveller to
his country, he choose the inn instead of his own home.

<span id="ii.XLI-p25"></span>5. But why this? Because He “scourgeth
every son whom He receiveth.” <span id="fr_1192"></span>[1193](#fn_1192.md)
Why this? Because to men sinning was it said, “In the sweat of thy face
shalt thou eat bread.” <span id="fr_1193"></span>[1194](#fn_1193.md)
Therefore because all these chastisements, in which all our bed is
turned in our infirmity, man ought to acknowledge that he suffers for
sin; let him turn himself, and say what follows: “I said, Lord, be
merciful unto me; heal my soul, for I have sinned against Thee” ([Psa.
41.4](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#004)<span id="ii.XLI-p27.2"></span>.md).
O Lord, by tribulations do Thou exercise me; to be scourged Thou judgest
every son whom Thou wilt receive, who sparedst not even the
Only-Begotten. He indeed without sin was scourged; but I say, “I have
sinned against Thee.”…

<span id="ii.XLI-p28"></span>6. “Mine enemies speak evil of Me, When He
shall die, then shall His Name perish” ([Psa.
41.5](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#005)<span id="ii.XLI-p28.1"></span>.md).
Of this we have already spoken, <span
id="fr_1194"></span>[1195](#fn_1194.md) and from this began.

<span id="ii.XLI-p30"></span>7. “And entered in <span
id="fr_1195"></span>[1196](#fn_1195.md) to see” ([Psa.
41.6](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#006)<span id="ii.XLI-p31.1"></span>.md).
What Christ suffered, that suffereth also the Church; what the Head
suffered, that suffer also the Members. “For the disciple is not above
his Master, nor the servant above his Lord.” <span
id="fr_1196"></span>[1197](#fn_1196.md) …

<span id="ii.XLI-p33"></span>If to Christ’s Members thou belongest, come
within, cling to the Head. Endure the tares if thou art wheat, endure
the chaff if thou art grain. <span id="fr_1197"></span>[1198](#fn_1197.md)
Endure the bad fish within the net if thou art a good fish. Wherefore
before the time of winnowing dost thou fly away? Wherefore before the
time of harvest, dost thou root up the corn also with thyself? Wherefore
before thou art come to the shore, hast thou broken the nets? “They go
abroad, and tell it.”

<span id="ii.XLI-p35"></span>8. “All mine enemies whisper against Me
unto the same thing” ([Psa. 41.7](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#007.md)<span
id="ii.XLI-p35.1"></span>). Against Me all unto the same thing. How much
better with me unto the same thing, than against me <span
id="fr_1198"></span>[1199](#fn_1198.md) “unto the same thing.” What is,
“Against me unto the same thing”? With one counsel, with one conspiring.
Christ then speaketh unto thee, Ye consent against Me, consent ye to Me:
why against Me? wherefore not with Me? That same thing if ye had always
had, ye had not divided you into schisms. For, saith the Apostle, “I
beseech you, brethren, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there
be no division among you.” <span id="fr_1199"></span>[1200](#fn_1199.md)
“All mine enemies whisper against Me unto the same thing:” against Me do
they “devise evil to Me.” To themselves rather, for “they have gathered
iniquity to themselves;” but therefore to Me, because by their intention
they are to be weighed: for not because to do nothing was in their
power, to do nothing was in their will. For the devil lusted to
extinguish Christ, and Judas would slay Christ; yet Christ slain and
rising again, we are made alive, but to the devil and to Judas is
rendered the reward of their evil will, not of our salvation.…The
intention wherewith they spake, not what they spake, did He consider,
who related that they spake evil of Him, “Against Me they devised evil
to Me.” And what evil to Christ, to the Martyrs what evil? All hath God
turned to good.

<span id="ii.XLI-p38"></span>9. “An ungodly word do they set forth
against Me” ([Psa. 41.8](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#008.md)<span
id="ii.XLI-p38.1"></span>). What sort of ungodly word? Listen to the
Head Itself. “Come, let us kill Him, and the inheritance shall be
ours.” <span id="fr_1200"></span>[1201](#fn_1200.md) Fools! How shall the
inheritance be yours? Because ye killed Him? Lo! ye even killed Him; yet
shall not the inheritance be yours. “Shall not He that sleepeth add this
also, that He rise again”? When ye exulted that ye had slain Him, He
slept; for He saith in another Psalm, “I slept.” They raged and would
slay Me; “I slept.” If I had not willed, I had not even slept. “I
slept,” because “I have power to lay down My life, and I have power to
take it again.”  <span id="fr_1201"></span>[1202](#fn_1201.md) “I laid Me
down and slept, and rose up again.” <span
id="fr_1202"></span>[1203](#fn_1202.md) Rage then the Jews; be “the earth
given into the hands of the wicked,” <span
id="fr_1203"></span>[1204](#fn_1203.md) be the flesh left to the hands of
persecutors, let them on wood suspend it, with nails transfix it, with a
spear pierce it. “Shall He that sleepeth, not add this, that He rise up
again?” Where<span id="page_131">p. 131</span> <span
id="ii.XLI-Page_131"></span>fore slept He? Because “Adam is the figure
of Him that was to come.” <span id="fr_1204"></span>[1205](#fn_1204.md) And
Adam slept, when out of his side was made Eve. <span
id="fr_1205"></span>[1206](#fn_1205.md) Adam in the figure of Christ, Eve
in the figure of the Church; whence she was called “the mother of all
living.” <span id="fr_1206"></span>[1207](#fn_1206.md) When was Eve
created? While Adam slept. When out of Christ’s side flowed the
Sacraments of the Church? While He slept upon the Cross.…

<span id="ii.XLI-p46"></span>10. “The man of My peace, in whom I
trusted, which did eat of My bread, hath enlarged his heel against Me”
([Psa. 41.9](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#009.md)<span
id="ii.XLI-p46.1"></span>): hath raised up his foot against Me: would
trample upon Me. Who is this man of His peace? Judas. And in him did
Christ trust, that He said, “in whom I trusted”? Did He not know him
from the beginning? Did He not before he was born know that he would be?
Had He not said to all His disciples, “I have chosen you twelve, and one
of you is a devil”? <span id="fr_1207"></span>[1208](#fn_1207.md) How then
trusted He in him, but that He is in His Members, and that because many
faithful trusted in Judas, the Lord transferred this to Himself?…“The
man of My peace, in whom I trusted, which did eat of My bread.” How
showed He him in His Passion? By the words of His prophecy: by the sop
He marked Him out, that it might appear said of him, “Which did eat of
My bread.” <span id="fr_1208"></span>[1209](#fn_1208.md) Again, when he
came to betray Him, He granted him a kiss, <span
id="fr_1209"></span>[1210](#fn_1209.md) that it might appear said of him,
“The man of My peace.”

<span id="ii.XLI-p50"></span>11. “But Thou, O Lord, be merciful unto Me”
([Psa. 41.10](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#010.md)<span
id="ii.XLI-p50.1"></span>). This is the person of a servant, this is the
person of the needy and poor: for, <span
id="fr_1210"></span>[1211](#fn_1210.md) “Blessed is he that understandeth
upon the needy and poor One.” See, as it was spoken, “Be merciful unto
Me, and raise Me up, and I will requite them,” so is it done. For the
Jews slew Christ, lest they should lose their place. <span
id="fr_1211"></span>[1212](#fn_1211.md) Christ slain, they lost their
place. Rooted out of the kingdom were they, dispersed were they. He,
raised up, requited them tribulation, He requited them unto admonition,
not yet unto condemnation. For the city wherein the people raged, as a
ramping and a roaring lion, crying out, “Crucify Him, Crucify
Him,” <span id="fr_1212"></span>[1213](#fn_1212.md) the Jews rooted out
therefrom, hath now Christians, by not one Jew is inhabited. <span
id="fr_1213"></span>[1214](#fn_1213.md) There is planted the Church of
Christ, whence were rooted out the thorns of the synagogue. For truly
this fire blazed “as the fire of thorns.” <span
id="fr_1214"></span>[1215](#fn_1214.md) But the Lord was as a green tree.
This said Himself, when certain women mourned Christ as dying.…“For if
they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in a dry?” When
can a green tree be consumed by the fire of thorns? For they blazed as
fire among thorns. Fire consumeth thorns, but whatsoever green tree it
is applied to, is not easily kindled.…Yet lest ye think that God the
Father of Christ could raise up Christ, that is, the Flesh of His Son,
and that Christ Himself, though He be the Word equal with the Father,
could not raise up His own Flesh; hear out of the Gospel, “Destroy this
temple, and in three days I will raise it up.” <span
id="fr_1215"></span>[1216](#fn_1215.md) “But,” said the Evangelist (lest
even after this we should doubt), “He spake of the temple of His Body.
Raise Me up, and I will requite them.”

<span id="ii.XLI-p57"></span>12. “By this I know that Thou favourest Me,
that Mine enemies shall not triumph over Me” ([Psa.
41.11](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#011)<span id="ii.XLI-p57.1"></span>..md)
Because the Jews did triumph, when they saw Christ crucified; they
thought that they had fulfilled their will to do Him hurt: the fruits of
their cruelty they saw in effect, Christ hanging on the Cross: they
shook their heads, saying, “If Thou be the Son of God, come down from
the Cross.”  <span id="fr_1216"></span>[1217](#fn_1216.md) He came not
down, who could; His Potency He showed not, but patience taught. For if,
on their saying these things, He had come down from the Cross, He would
have seemed as it were to yield to them insulting, and not being able to
endure reproach, would have been believed conquered: more firm remained
He upon the Cross, than they insulting; fixed was He, they wavering. For
therefore shook they their heads, because to the true Head they adhered
not. He taught us plainly patience. For mightier is that which He did,
who would not do what the Jews challenged. For much mightier is it to
rise from the sepulchre, than to come down from the Cross. “That Mine
enemies shall not triumph over Me.” They triumphed then at that time.
Christ rose again, Christ was glorified. Now see they in His Name the
human race converted: now let them insult, now shake the head: rather
now let them fix the head, or if they shake the head, in wonder and
admiration let them shake.…

<span id="ii.XLI-p59"></span>13. “But as for Me, Thou upholdest Me,
because of Mine innocence” ([Psa.
41.12](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#012)<span id="ii.XLI-p59.1"></span>.md).
Truly innocence; integrity without sin, requiting without debt,
scourging without desert. “Thou upholdest Me because of Mine innocence,
and hast made Me strong in Thy sight for ever.” Thou hast made Me strong
for ever, Thou madest Me weak for a time: Thou hast made Me strong in
Thy sight, Thou madest Me weak in sight of men. What then? Praise to
Him, glory to Him. “Blessed be the Lord God of Israel.” <span
id="page_132">p. 132</span> <span id="ii.XLI-Page_132"></span>For He is
the God of Israel, our God, the God of Jacob, the God of the younger
son, the God of the younger people. Let none say, Of the Jews said He
this, I am not Israel; rather the Jews are not Israel. For the elder
son, he is the elder people reprobated; the younger, the people beloved.
“The elder shall serve the younger:” <span
id="fr_1217"></span>[1218](#fn_1217.md) now is it fulfilled: now, brethren,
the Jews serve us, they are as our satchellers, <span
id="fr_1218"></span>[1219](#fn_1218.md) we studying, they carry our books.
Hear wherein the Jews serve us, and not without reason.…With them are
the Law and the Prophets, in which Law, and in which Prophets, Christ is
preached. When we have to do with Pagans, and show this coming to pass
in the Church of Christ, which before was predicted of the Name of
Christ, of the Head and Body of Christ, lest they think that we have
forged these predictions, and from things which have happened, as though
they were future, had made them up, we bring forth the books of the
Jews. The Jews forsooth are our enemies, from an enemy’s books convince
we the adversary. <span id="fr_1219"></span>[1220](#fn_1219.md) …If any
enemy clamour and say, “Ye for yourselves have forged prophecies;” be
the books of the Jews brought forth, because the elder shall serve the
younger. Therein let them read those predictions, which now we see
fulfilled; and let us all say, “Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, from
everlasting to everlasting, and all the people shall say, So be it, So
be it.”

<span id="ii.XLI-p10"></span> In the *City of God*, b. xviii. c. 53, 54,
he mentions that the heathens had some Greek verses, in the form of an
oracle, to the effect that the magical arts of Peter had prevailed to
procure divine worship to Christ for 365 years, after which it was to
terminate. This period, he says, if computed from the first Pentecost
after the Resurrection, would expire in the consulship of Honorius and
Eutychianus, A.D. 398. The next year, which ought to have seen paganism
re-established, was marked by the demolition of idols by imperial
authority.—*Ben*. \[See vol. ii. p. 394, this series.—C.\]
