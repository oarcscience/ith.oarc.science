<span id="ii.CXLIV-p1"></span> <span id="ii.CXLIV-p1.1"></span><span
class="c20"><span id="ii.CXLIV-p1.2"></span>Psalm CXLIV. <span
id="fr_5837"></span>[5838](#fn_5837.md) </span>

<span id="ii.CXLIV-p3"></span>1. The title of this Psalm is brief in
number of words, but heavy in the weight of its mysteries. “To David
himself against Goliath.” This battle was fought in the time of our
fathers, and ye, beloved, remember it with me from Holy Scripture.…David
put five stones in his scrip, he hurled but one. The five Books were
chosen, but unity conquered. Then, having smitten and overthrown him, he
took the enemy’s sword, and with it cut off his head. This our David
also did, He overthrew the devil with his own weapons: and when his
great ones, whom he had in his power, by means of whom he slew other
souls, believe, they turn their tongues against the devil, and so
Goliath’s head is cut off with his own sword.

<span id="ii.CXLIV-p4"></span>2. “Blessed be the Lord my God, who
teacheth my hands for battle, my fingers for war” ([Psa.
144.1](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#001.md)<span
id="ii.CXLIV-p4.1"></span>). These are our words, if we be the Body of
Christ. It seems a repetition of sentiment; “our hands for battle,” and
“our fingers for war,” are the same. Or is there some difference between
“hands” and “fingers”? Certainly both hands and fingers work. Not then
without reason do we take “fingers” as put for “hands.” But still in the
“fingers” we recognise the division of operation, yet still a sort of
unity. Behold that grace! the Apostle saith, <span
id="fr_5838"></span>[5839](#fn_5838.md) To one, this; to another, that;
“there are diversities of operations; all these worketh one and the
self-same Spirit;” there is the root of unity. With these “fingers” then
the Body of Christ fighteth, going forth to “war,” going forth to
“battle.”…By works of Mercy our enemy is conquered, and we could not
have works of mercy unless we had charity, and charity we could have
none unless we received it by the Holy Ghost; He then “teacheth our
hands for battle, and our fingers for war:” to Him rightfully do we say,
“My Mercy,” from whom we have also that we are merciful: “for he shall
have judgment without mercy, that hath showed no mercy.” <span
id="fr_5839"></span>[5840](#fn_5839.md)

<span id="ii.CXLIV-p7"></span>3. My Mercy and my Refuge, my Upholder and
my Deliverer” ([Psa. 144.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#002.md)<span
id="ii.CXLIV-p7.1"></span>). Much toileth this combatant, having his
flesh lusting against his spirit. Keep what thou hast. Then shalt thou
have in full what thou wishest, when “death shall have been swallowed up
in victory;” <span id="fr_5840"></span>[5841](#fn_5840.md) when this mortal
body has been raised, and is changed into the condition of the angels,
and rises aloft to a heavenly quality.…There is life, there are good
days, where nought lusteth against the spirit, where it is not said,
“Fight,” but “Rejoice.” But who is he that lusteth for these days? Every
man certainly saith, “I do.” Hear what followeth. I see that thou art
toiling, I see that thou art engaged in battle, and in danger; hear what
followeth:…“Depart from evil, and do good:” let not the poor first weep
under thee, that the poor may rejoice <span id="page_655">p. 655</span>
<span id="ii.CXLIV-Page_655"></span>through thee. For what reward, since
now thou art fighting? “Seek peace, and ensue it.” Learn and say, “My
Mercy and my Refuge, mine Upholder and my Deliverer, my Protector:”
“mine Upholder,” lest I fall; “my Deliverer,” lest I stick; “my
Protector,” lest I be stricken. In all these things, in all my toil, in
all my battles, in all my difficulties, in Him have I hoped, “who
subdueth my people under me.” Behold, our Head speaketh together with
us.

<span id="ii.CXLIV-p9"></span>4. “Lord, what is man, that Thou hast
become known unto him?” ([Psa.
144.3](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#003.md)<span
id="ii.CXLIV-p9.1"></span>). All is included in “that Thou hast become
known unto him.” “Or the son of man, that Thou valuest him?” Thou
valuest him, that is, Thou makest him of such importance, Thou countest
him of such price, Thou knowest under what Thou placest him, over what
Thou placest him. For valuing is considering the price of a thing. How
greatly did He value man, who for him shed the blood of His
only-begotten Son! For God valueth not man in the same way as one man
valueth another: he, when he findeth a slave for sale, giveth a higher
price for a horse than for a man. Consider how greatly He valued thee,
that thou mayest be able to say, “If God be for us, who can be against
us?” And how greatly did He value thee, “who spared not His own Son”?
“How shall He not also with Him freely give us all things?” <span
id="fr_5841"></span>[5842](#fn_5841.md) He who giveth this food to the
combatant, what keepeth He in store for the conqueror?…

<span id="ii.CXLIV-p11"></span>5. “Man is made like unto vanity: his
days pass away like a shadow” ([Psa.
144.4](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#004.md)<span
id="ii.CXLIV-p11.1"></span>). What vanity? Time, which passeth on, and
floweth by. For this “vanity” is said in comparison of the Truth, which
ever abideth, and never faileth: for it too is a work of His Hand, in
its degree. “For,” as it is written, “God filled the earth with His good
things.” <span id="fr_5842"></span>[5843](#fn_5842.md) What is “His”? That
accord with Him. But all these things, being earthly, fleeting,
transitory, if they be compared to that Truth, where it is said, “I Am
That I Am,” <span id="fr_5843"></span>[5844](#fn_5843.md) all this which
passeth away is called “vanity.” For through time it vanisheth, like
stroke into the air. And why should I say more than that which the
Apostle James said, willing to bring down proud men to humility, “What
is,” saith he, “your life? It is even a vapour, which appeareth for a
little time, and then vanisheth away.” <span
id="fr_5844"></span>[5845](#fn_5844.md) …Work then, though it be in the
night, with thine hands, that is, by good works seek God, before the day
come which shall gladden thee, lest the day come which shall sadden
thee. For see how safely thou workest, who art not left by Him whom thou
seekest; “that thy Father which seeth in secret may reward thee
openly.” <span id="fr_5845"></span>[5846](#fn_5845.md) …

<span id="ii.CXLIV-p16"></span>6. “Lord, bow Thy heavens, and come down:
touch the mountains, and they shall smoke” ([Psa.
144.5](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#005.md)<span
id="ii.CXLIV-p16.1"></span>). “Flash Thy lightning, and Thou shalt
scatter them; send forth Thine arrows, and Thou shalt confound them”
([Psa. 144.6](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#006.md)<span
id="ii.CXLIV-p16.2"></span>). “Send forth Thy Hand from above, and
deliver me, and draw me out of many waters” ([Psa.
144.7](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#007.md)<span
id="ii.CXLIV-p16.3"></span>). The Body of Christ, the humble David, full
of grace, relying on God, fighting in this world, calleth for the help
of God. What are “heavens bowed down”? Apostles humbled. For those
“heavens declare the glory of God;” and of these heavens declaring the
glory of God it is presently said, “There is neither speech nor
language, but their voices are heard among them,” etc. <span
id="fr_5846"></span>[5847](#fn_5846.md) When then these heavens sent forth
their voices through all lands, and did wonderful things, while the Lord
flashed and thundered from them by miracles and commandments, the gods
were thought to have come down from heaven to men. For certain of the
Gentiles, thinking this, desired even to sacrifice to them.…But they
commended to these the Lord Jesus Christ, humbling themselves, that God
might be praised; because “the heavens” were “bowed,” that “God” might
“come down.”…“Touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.” So long as
they are not touched, they seem to themselves great: they are now about
to say, “Great art Thou, O Lord:” <span
id="fr_5847"></span>[5848](#fn_5847.md) the mountains also are about to
say, “Thou only art the Most Highest over all the earth.” <span
id="fr_5848"></span>[5849](#fn_5848.md)

<span id="ii.CXLIV-p20"></span>7. But there are some that conspire, that
“gather themselves together against the Lord, and against His
Christ.” <span id="fr_5849"></span>[5850](#fn_5849.md) They have come
together, they have conspired. “Flash forth Thy lightnings, and Thou
shalt scatter them.” Abound with Thy miracles, and their conspiracy
shall be broken.…“Send forth Thine arrows, and Thou shalt confound
them.” Let the unsound be wounded, that, being well wounded, they may be
made sound; and let them say, being set now in the Church, in the Body
of Christ, let them say with the Church, “I am wounded with Love.” <span
id="fr_5850"></span>[5851](#fn_5850.md) “Send forth Thine Hand from on
high.” What afterward? What in the end? How conquereth the Body of
Christ? By heavenly aid. “For the Lord Himself shall come with the voice
of the Archangel, and with the trump of God shall He descend from
heaven,” <span id="fr_5851"></span>[5852](#fn_5851.md) Himself the Saviour
of the body, the Hand of God. What is, “Out of many waters”? From many
peoples. What peoples? Aliens, unbelievers, whether assailing us from
without, or laying snares within. Take me out of many waters, in which
Thou didst discipline me, in which Thou didst roll me, to free me from
my filth. This is the “water of contradiction.” <span
id="fr_5852"></span>[5853](#fn_5852.md) …“From the hand of strange <span
id="page_656">p. 656</span> <span
id="ii.CXLIV-Page_656"></span>children.” Hear, brethren, among whom we
are, among whom we live, from whom we long to be delivered. “Whose mouth
hath spoken vanity” ([Psa. 144.8](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#008.md)<span
id="ii.CXLIV-p24.2"></span>). All of you to-day, if ye had not gathered
yourselves together to these divine shows <span
id="fr_5853"></span>[5854](#fn_5853.md) of the word of God, and were not at
this hour engaged in them, how great vanities would ye be hearing!
“whose mouth hath spoken vanity:” when, in short, would they, speaking
vanity, hear you speaking vanity? “And their right hand is a right hand
of iniquity.” What doest thou among them with thy pastoral scrip with
five stones in it? Say it to me in another form: that same law which
thou hast signified by five stones, signify in some other way also. “I
will sing a new song unto Thee, O God” ([Psa.
144.9](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#009.md)<span
id="ii.CXLIV-p25.1"></span>). “A new song” is of grace; “a new song” is
of the new man; “a new song” is of the New Testament. But lest thou
shouldest think that grace departeth from the law, whereas rather by
grace the law is fulfilled, “upon a psaltery of ten strings will I sing
unto Thee.” Upon the law of ten commandments: therein may I sing to
Thee; therein may I rejoice to Thee; therein may “I sing to Thee a new
song;” for, “Love is the fulfilling of the law.”  <span
id="fr_5854"></span>[5855](#fn_5854.md) But they who have not love may
carry the psaltery, sing they cannot. Contradiction cannot make my
psaltery to be silent.

<span id="ii.CXLIV-p27"></span>8. “Who giveth salvation to kings, who
redeemeth David His servant” ([Psa.
144.10](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#010.md)<span
id="ii.CXLIV-p27.1"></span>). Ye know who David is; be yourselves David.
Whence “redeemeth He David His servant”? Whence redeemeth He Christ?
Whence redeemeth He the Body of Christ? “From the sword of ill intent
deliver me.” “From the sword” is not sufficient; he addeth, “of ill
intent.” Without doubt there is a sword of good intent. What is the
sword of good intent? That whereof the Lord saith, “I came not to send
peace on earth, but a sword.”  <span
id="fr_5855"></span>[5856](#fn_5855.md) For He was about to separate
believers from unbelievers, sons from parents, and to sever all other
ties, while the sword cut off what was diseased, but healed the members
of Christ. Of good intent then is the sword twice sharpened, powerful
with both edges, the Old and New Testaments, with the narration of the
past and the promise of the future. That then is the sword of good
intent: but the other is of ill intent, wherewith they talk vanity, for
that is of good intent, wherewith God speaketh verity. For truly “the
sons of men have teeth which are spears and arrows, and their tongue is
a sharp sword.” <span id="fr_5856"></span>[5857](#fn_5856.md) “From” this
“sword deliver me” ([Psa. 144.11](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#011.md)<span
id="ii.CXLIV-p29.2"></span>). “And take me out of the hand of strange
children, whose mouth hath spoken vanity:” just as before. And that
which followeth, “their right hand is a right hand of iniquity,” the
same he had set down before also, when he called them “many waters.” For
lest thou shouldest think that the “many waters” were good waters, he
explained them by the “sword of ill intent.”

<span id="ii.CXLIV-p30"></span>9. “Whose sons are like young vines
firmly planted in their youth” ([Psa.
144.12](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#012.md)<span
id="ii.CXLIV-p30.1"></span>). He wisheth to recount their happiness.
Observe, ye sons of light, sons of peace: observe, ye sons of the
Church, members of Christ; observe whom he calleth “strangers,” whom he
calleth “strange children,” whom he calleth “waters of contradiction,”
whom he calleth a “sword of ill intent.” Observe, I beseech you, for
among them ye are in peril, among their tongues ye fight against the
desires of your flesh, among their tongues, set in the hand of the devil
wherewith he fighteth. <span id="fr_5857"></span>[5858](#fn_5857.md) …What
vanity hath their mouth spoken, and how is their right hand a right hand
of iniquity? “Their daughters are fitted and adorned after the
similitude of a temple.” “Their garners are full, bursting out from one
store to another: their sheep are fruitful, multiplying in their
streets” ([Psa. 144.13](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#013.md)<span
id="ii.CXLIV-p31.2"></span>): “their oxen are fat: their hedge is not
broken down, nor their road, nor is their crying in their streets”
([Psa. 144.14](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#014.md)<span
id="ii.CXLIV-p31.3"></span>). Is not this then happiness? I ask the sons
of the kingdom of heaven, I ask the offspring of everlasting
resurrection, I ask the body of Christ, the members of Christ, the
temple of God. Is not this then happiness, to have sons safe, daughters
beautiful, garners full, cattle abundant, no downfall, I say not of a
wall, but not even of a hedge, no tumult and clamour in the streets, but
quiet, peace, abundance, plenty of all things in their houses and in
their cities? Is not this then happiness? or ought the righteous to shun
it? or findest thou not the house of the righteous too abounding with
all these things, full of this happiness? Did not Abraham’s house abound
with gold, silver, children, servants, cattle? What say we? is not this
happiness? Be it so, still it is on the left hand. What is, on the left
hand? Temporal, mortal, bodily. I desire not that thou shun it, but that
thou think it not to be on the right hand.…For what ought they to have
set on the right hand? God, eternity, the years of God which fail not,
whereof is said, “and Thy years shall not fail.” <span
id="fr_5858"></span>[5859](#fn_5858.md) There should be the right hand,
there should be our longing. Let us use the left for the time, let us
long for the fight for eternity. “If riches increase, set not your heart
upon them.” <span id="fr_5859"></span>[5860](#fn_5859.md) …

<span id="ii.CXLIV-p34"></span>10. “They have called the people blessed
who have these things” ([Psa.
144.15](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#015.md)<span
id="ii.CXLIV-p34.1"></span>). O men that speak vanity! They have lost
the true right hand, wicked and perverse, they have put on the benefits
of God inversely. O wicked ones, O speakers of vanity, O strange
children! <span id="page_657">p. 657</span> <span
id="ii.CXLIV-Page_657"></span>What was on the left hand, they have set
on the right. What dost thou, David? What dost thou, Body of Christ?
What do ye, members of Christ? What do ye, not strange children, but
children of God?…What say ye? Say ye with us, “Blessed is the people
whose Lord is their God.”
