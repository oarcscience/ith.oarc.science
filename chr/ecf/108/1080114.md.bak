<span id="ii.CIII-p1"></span> <span id="ii.CIII-p1.1"></span><span
class="c20"><span id="ii.CIII-p1.2"></span>Psalm CIII. <span
id="fr_4647"></span>[4648](#fn_4647.md) </span>

<span id="ii.CIII-p3"></span>1. …“Bless the Lord, O my soul! and all
that is within me, His holy Name” ([Psa.
103.1](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#001)<span id="ii.CIII-p3.1"></span>.md).
I suppose that he speaketh not of what is within the body; I do not
suppose him to mean this, that our lungs and liver, and so forth, are to
burst forth into the voice of blessing of the Lord. There are lungs in
our breast indeed, like a kind of bellows, which send forth successive
breathings, which breathing forth of the air inhaled is pressed out into
voice and sound, when the words are articulated; nor can any utterance
sound forth from our mouth, but what the pressed lungs have given vent
to; but this is not the meaning here; all this relateth to the ears of
men. God hath ears: the heart also hath a voice. A man speaketh to the
things within him, that they may bless God, and saith unto them, “all
that is within me bless His holy Name!” Dost thou ask the meaning of
what is within thee? Thy soul itself. In saying then, “all that is
within me, bless His holy Name,” it only repeateth the above, “Bless the
Lord, O my soul:” for the word “Bless,” is understood. Cry out with thy
voice, if there be a man to hear; hush thy voice, when there is no man
to hear thee; there is never wanting one to hear all that is within
thee. Blessing therefore hath already been uttered from our mouth, when
we were chanting these very words. We sung as much as sufficed for the
time, and were then silent: ought our hearts within us to be silent to
the blessing of the Lord? Let the sound of our voices bless Him at
intervals, alternately, let the voice of our hearts be perpetual. When
thou comest to church to recite a hymn, thy voice soundeth forth the
praises of God: thou hast sung as far as thou couldest, thou hast left
the church; let thy soul sound the praises of God. Thou art engaged in
thy daily work: let thy soul praise God. Thou art taking food; see what
the Apostle saith: “Whether ye eat or drink, do all to the glory of
God.” <span id="fr_4648"></span>[4649](#fn_4648.md) I venture to say; when
thou sleepest, let thy soul praise the Lord. Let not thoughts of crime
arouse thee, let not the contrivances of thieving arouse thee, let not
arranged plans of corrupt <span id="page_504">p. 504</span> <span
id="ii.CIII-Page_504"></span>dealing arouse thee. Thy innocence even
when thou art sleeping is the voice of thy soul.

<span id="ii.CIII-p5"></span>2. “Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget
not all His rewards” ([Psa. 103.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#002.md)<span
id="ii.CIII-p5.1"></span>). But the rewards of the Lord cannot be before
thine eyes unless thy sins are before thine eyes. Let not delight in
past sin be before thine eyes, but let the condemnation of sin be before
thine eyes: condemnation from thee, forgiveness from God. For thus God
rewardeth thee, so that thou mayest say, “How shall I reward the Lord
for all His rewards unto me?” <span id="fr_4649"></span>[4650](#fn_4649.md)
This it was that the martyrs considering (whose memory we are this day
celebrating), and all the saints who have despised this life, and as ye
have heard in the Epistle of St. John, laid down their lives for the
brethren, which is the perfection of love, <span
id="fr_4650"></span>[4651](#fn_4650.md) even as our Lord saith: “Greater
love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his
friends:” <span id="fr_4651"></span>[4652](#fn_4651.md) this the holy
martyrs, then, considering, despised their lives here, that they might
find them there, following our Lord’s words when He said, “He that
loveth his life, shall lose it; and he that loseth his life for My sake,
shall keep it unto life eternal.” <span
id="fr_4652"></span>[4653](#fn_4652.md) …“Forget not,” he saith, “all His
rewards:” not awards, but “rewards.” <span
id="fr_4653"></span>[4654](#fn_4653.md) For something else was due, and
what was not due hath been paid. Whence also these words: “What,” he
asketh, “shall I reward the Lord for all His rewards unto me?” Thou hast
rewarded good with evil; He rewardeth evil with good. How hast thou, O
man, rewarded thy God with evil for good? Thou who hast once been a
blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious, <span
id="fr_4654"></span>[4655](#fn_4654.md) hast rewarded blasphemies. For what
good things? First, because thou art: but a stone also is. Next, because
thou livest: but a brute also liveth. What reward wilt thou give the
Lord, for His having created thee above all the cattle; and above all
the fowls of the air, in His image and likeness? <span
id="fr_4655"></span>[4656](#fn_4655.md) Seek not how to reward Him: give
back unto Him His own image: He requireth no more; He demandeth His own
coin. <span id="fr_4656"></span>[4657](#fn_4656.md) …

<span id="ii.CIII-p14"></span>3. Think thou, soul, of all the rewards of
God, in thinking over all thy wicked deeds: for as many as are thy sins,
so many are His rewards of good. And what present, what offering, what
sacrifice, canst thou ever tender unto Him?…What wilt thou reward the
Lord with? For thou wast reflecting, and couldest not find: “I will
receive the cup of salvation.” What? hath not the Lord Himself given the
cup of salvation? Reward Him from thine own, if thou canst. I would say,
No, do it not; reward Him not from thine own; God doth not will to be
rewarded from thine own. If thou rewardest Him from thine own, thou
rewardest sin. For all that thou hast thou hast from Him: sins only thou
hast of thine own. He doth not wish to be rewarded from thine, He doth
will from His own. Just as, if thou shouldest bring to a husbandman,
from the land which he hath sown, an ear of wheat, thou hast rewarded
him from the husbandman’s own produce; if thorns, that hast offered him
of thine own. Reward truth, in truth praise the Lord: if thou shalt
choose to reward Him from thine own, thou wilt lie. He who speaketh a
lie, speaketh of his own. <span id="fr_4657"></span>[4658](#fn_4657.md) If
he who speaketh a lie, speaketh of his own: so he who speaketh truth,
speaketh of the Lord’s. But what is to receive the cup of salvation, but
to imitate the Passion of our Lord?…I will receive the cup of Christ, I
will drink of our Lord’s Passion. Beware that thou fail not. But, “I
will call upon the Name of the Lord.” They then who failed, called not
upon the Lord; they presumed in their own strength. Do thou so return,
as remembering that thou art returning what thou hast received. So then
let thy soul bless the Lord, as not to forget all His rewards.

<span id="ii.CIII-p16"></span>4. Hear ye all His rewards. “Who forgiveth
all thy sin: who healeth all thine infirmities” ([Psa.
103.3](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#003.md)<span
id="ii.CIII-p16.1"></span>). Behold His rewards. What, save punishment,
was due unto the sinner? What was due to the blasphemer, but the hell of
burning fire? He gave not these rewards: that thou mayest not shudder
with dread: and without love fear Him.…But thou art a sinner. Turn
again, and receive these His rewards: He “forgiveth all thy sin.”…Yet
even after remission of sins the soul herself is shaken by certain
passions; still is she amid the dangers of temptation, still is she
pleased with certain suggestions; with some she is not pleased, and
sometimes she consenteth unto some of those with which she is pleased:
she is taken. This is infirmity: but He “healeth all thine infirmities.”
All thine infirmities shall be healed: fear not. They are great, thou
wilt say: but the Physician is greater. No infirmity cometh before the
Almighty Physician as incurable: only suffer thou thyself to be healed:
repel not His hands; He knoweth how to deal with thee. Be not only
pleased when He cherisheth thee, but also bear with Him when He useth
the knife: bear the pain of the remedy, reflecting on thy future
health.…Thou dost not endure in uncertainty: He who promised thee
health, cannot be deceived. The physician is often deceived: and
promiseth health in the human body. Why is he deceived? Because he is
not healing his own creature. God made thy body, God made thy soul. He
knoweth how to restore what He <span id="page_505">p. 505</span> <span
id="ii.CIII-Page_505"></span>hath made, He knoweth how to fashion again
what He hath already fashioned: do thou only be patient beneath the
Physician’s hands: for He hateth one who rejects His hands. This doth
not happen with the hands of a human physician.…

<span id="ii.CIII-p17"></span>5. “Who redeemeth thy life from
corruption” ([Psa. 103.4](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#004.md)<span
id="ii.CIII-p17.1"></span>). Behold, “the body which is corrupted,
weigheth down the soul.” <span id="fr_4658"></span>[4659](#fn_4658.md) The
soul then hath life in a corruptible body. What sort of life? It
suffereth burdens, it beareth weights. How great obstacles are there to
thinking of God Himself, as it is right that men should think of God, as
if interrupting us from the necessity of human corruption? how many
influences recall us, how many interrupt, how many withdraw the mind
when fixed on high? what a crowd of illusions, what tribes of
suggestions? All this in the human heart, as it were, teemeth with the
worms of human corruption. We have set forth the greatness of the
disease, let us also praise the Physician. Shall not He then heal thee,
who made thee such as to be in health, hadst thou chosen to keep the law
of health which thou hadst received?…First think of thine own health.
Sometimes a man is stricken in his own house, on his bed, with a more
than usually manifest disorder; although this disorder too, which men
dislike to contemplate, be plain; yet each man may be attacked with that
sickness for which human physicians are sought, and may gasp with fever
in his bed; perhaps he may wish to consider of his domestic affairs, to
make some order or disposition relating to his estate or his house; at
once he is recalled from such cares by the anxiety of his friends,
plainly expressed around him, and he is advised to dismiss these
subjects, and first to take thought for his health. This then is
addressed unto thee, and to all men: if thou art not sick, think of
other things: if thy very infirmity prove thee sick, first take heed of
thy health. Christ is thy health: think therefore of Christ. Receive the
cup of His saving Health, “who healeth all thine infirmities;” if thou
shalt choose, thou shalt gain this Health.…For thy life hath been
redeemed from corruption: rest secure now: the contract of good faith
hath been entered upon; no man deceives, no man circumvents, no man
oppresses, thy Redeemer. He hath here made a barter, He hath already
paid the price, He hath poured forth His blood. The only Son of God, I
say, hath shed His blood for us: O soul, raise thyself, thou art of so
great price.…“He redeemeth thy life from corruption.”

<span id="ii.CIII-p19"></span>6. “Who crowneth thee with mercy and
loving-kindness.” Thou hadst perhaps begun to be in a manner proud, when
thou didst hear the words, “He crowneth thee.” I am then great, I have
then wrestled. By whose strength? By thine, but supplied by Him.…He
crowneth thee, because He is crowning His own gifts, not thy deservings.
“I laboured more abundantly than they all,” said the Apostle; but see
what he addeth: “yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.”
 <span id="fr_4659"></span>[4660](#fn_4659.md) …It is then by His mercy
that thou art crowned; in nothing be proud; ever praise the Lord; forget
not all His rewards. It is a reward when thou, a sinner and an ungodly
man, hast been called, that thou mayest be justified. It is a reward,
when thou art raised up and guided, that thou mayest not fall. It is a
reward, when strength is given thee, that thou mayest persevere unto the
end. It is a reward, that even that flesh of thine by which thou wast
oppressed riseth again and that not even a hair of thy head perisheth.
It is a reward, that after thy resurrection thou art crowned. It is a
reward, that thou mayest praise God Himself for evermore without
ceasing.…

<span id="ii.CIII-p21"></span>7. After the battle, then, I shall be
crowned; after the crown, what shall I do? “He who satisfieth thy
longing with good things” ([Psa.
103.5](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#005.md)<span
id="ii.CIII-p21.1"></span>).…Seek thy own good, O soul. For one thing is
good to one creature, another to another, and all creatures have a
certain good of their own, to the completeness and perfection of their
nature. There is a difference as to what is essential to each imperfect
thing, in order that it may be made perfect; seek for thy own good.
“There is none good but One, that is, God.” <span
id="fr_4660"></span>[4661](#fn_4660.md) The highest good is thy good. What
then is wanting unto him to whom the highest good is good? For there are
inferior goods, which are good to different creatures respectively.
What, brethren, is good unto the cattle, save to fill the belly, to
prevent want, to sleep, to indulge themselves, to exist, to be in
health, to propagate? This is good to them: and within certain bounds it
hath an allotted measure of good, granted by God, the Creator of all
things. Dost thou seek such a good as this? God giveth also this: but do
not pursue it alone. Canst thou, a coheir of Christ, rejoice in
fellowship with cattle? Raise thy hope to the good of all goods. He will
be thy good, by whom thou in thy kind hast been made good, and by whom
all things in their kind were made good. For God made all things very
good.…

<span id="ii.CIII-p23"></span>8. When shall my longing be satisfied with
good things? when, dost thou ask? “Thy youth shall be renewed as the
eagle’s.” Dost thou then ask when thy soul is to be satisfied with good
things? When thy youth shall be restored. And he addeth, as an eagle’s.
Something here <span id="page_506">p. 506</span> <span
id="ii.CIII-Page_506"></span>lieth hidden; what however is said of the
eagle, we will not pass over silently, since it is not foreign to our
purpose to understand it. Let this only be impressed upon our hearts,
that it is not said without cause by the Holy Spirit. For it hath
intimated unto us a sort of resurrection. And indeed the youth of the
eagle is restored, but not into immortality, for a similitude hath been
given, as far as it could be drawn from a thing mortal to signify a
thing immortal, not to demonstrate it. The eagle is said, after it
becometh overpowered with bodily age, to be incapable of taking food
from the immoderate length of its beak, which is always increasing. For
after the upper part of its beak, which forms a crook above the lower
part, hath increased from old age to an immoderate length, the length of
this increase will not allow of its opening its mouth, so as to form any
interval between the lower beak and the crook above. For unless there be
such an opening, it hath no power of biting like a forceps, by which to
shear off what it may put within its jaws. The upper part therefore
increasing, and being too far hooked over, it cannot open its mouth, and
take any food. This old age doth to it, it is weighed down with the
infirmity of age, and becometh too weak from want of power to eat; two
causes of infirmity assaulting it, old age, and want. By a natural
device, therefore, in order in some measure to restore its youth, the
eagle is said to dash and strike against a rock the upper lip of its
beak, by the too great increase of which the opening for eating is
closed: and by thus rubbing it against the rock, it breaketh off the
weight of its old beak, which impeded its taking food. It cometh to its
food, and everything is restored: it will be after its old age like a
young eagle; the vigour of all its limbs returneth, the lustre of its
plumage, the guidance of its wings, it flieth aloft as before, a sort of
resurrection taketh place in it. For this is the object of the
similitude, like that of the Moon, which after waning and being
apparently intercepted, again is renewed, and becometh full; and
signifieth to us the resurrection; but when it is full it doth not
remain so; again it waneth, that the signification may never cease. Thus
also what hath here been said of the eagle: the eagle is not restored
unto immortality, but we are unto eternal life; but the similitude is
derived from hence, that the rock taketh away from us what hindereth us.
Presume not therefore on thy strength: the firmness of the rock rubbeth
off thy old age: for that Rock was Christ.  <span
id="fr_4661"></span>[4662](#fn_4661.md) In Christ our youth shall be
restored like that of the eagle.…

<span id="ii.CIII-p25"></span>9. “The Lord executeth mercy and judgment
for all them that are oppressed with wrong” ([Psa.
103.6](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#006.md)<span
id="ii.CIII-p25.1"></span>).…An adulterous woman is brought forward to
be stoned according to the Law, but she is brought before the Lawgiver
Himself.…Our Lord, at the time she was brought before Him, bending His
Head, began writing on the earth. When He bent Himself down upon the
earth, He then wrote on the earth: before He bent upon the earth, He
wrote not on the earth, but on stone. The earth was now something
fertile, ready to bring forth from the Lord’s letters. On the stone He
had written the Law, intimating the hardness of the Jews: He wrote on
the earth, signifying the productiveness of Christians. Then they who
were leading the adulteress came, like raging waves against a rock: but
they were dashed to pieces by His answer. For He said to them, “He that
is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.”  <span
id="fr_4662"></span>[4663](#fn_4662.md) And again bending His head, He
began writing on the ground. And now each man, when he asked his own
conscience, came not forward. It was not a weak adulterous woman, but
their own adulterate conscience, that drove them back. They wished to
punish, to judge; they came to the Rock, their judges were overthrown by
the Rock. <span id="fr_4663"></span>[4664](#fn_4663.md) …

<span id="ii.CIII-p28"></span>10. Execute mercy to <span
id="fr_4664"></span>[4665](#fn_4664.md) the wicked, not as being wicked. Do
not receive the wicked, in so far forth as he is wicked: that is, do not
receive him as if from inclination towards and love for his iniquity.
For it is forbidden to give unto a sinner, and to receive sinners. Yet
how is this, “Give unto every man that asketh of thee”? and this, “if
thine enemy hunger, feed him”? <span
id="fr_4665"></span>[4666](#fn_4665.md) This is seemingly contradictory:
but it is opened to those who knock in the name of Christ, and will be
clear unto those who seek. “Help not a sinner:” and, “give not to the
ungodly;” <span id="fr_4666"></span>[4667](#fn_4666.md) and yet, “give unto
every man that asketh of thee.” But it is a sinner who asketh of me.
Give, not as unto a sinner. When dost thou give as unto a sinner? When
that which maketh him a sinner, pleaseth thee so that thou givest. <span
id="fr_4667"></span>[4668](#fn_4667.md) …Let those who give to a man who
fights with wild beasts, tell me why they give? Why doth he give to this
man? He loveth that in him, in which consists his greatest sin; this he
feedeth, this he clotheth in him, wickedness itself, made public by all
witnessing it. Why doth the man give, who giveth to actors, or to
charioteers, or to courtesans? Do not these very persons give to human
beings? But it is not the nature of God’s work that they attend to, but
the iniquity of the human work.…When therefore thou givest, thou givest
to infamy, not to bravery. As then he who giveth to the fighter of
beasts, giveth not to the <span id="page_507">p. 507</span> <span
id="ii.CIII-Page_507"></span>man, but to a most infamous profession; for
if he were only a man, and not a fighter of beasts, thou wouldest not
give; thou honourest him in vice, not nature: so on the other hand, if
thou give to the righteous, if thou give to the prophet, if thou give to
the disciple of Christ anything of which he is in want, without thinking
that he is Christ’s disciple, that he is God’s minister, that he is
God’s steward; but art thinking in that case of some temporal advantage,
for instance, that when perchance he shall be needful to thy cause, he
may be bought for thee, because thou hast given him something; thou hast
no more given to the righteous, if thou hast thus given, than he gave to
the man, when he gave to the beast-fighter. The matter, then, most
beloved, is quite open to us, and I conceive, that although it was
obscure, it is now clear. It was to this that the Lord bound thee, when
He said, “He who hath received the righteous man.” That were enough. But
as the righteous may be received with another intention,…He saith, “He
who receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man:” <span
id="fr_4668"></span>[4669](#fn_4668.md) that is, receiving him in
consideration of his righteousness:…that is, because he is Christ’s
disciple, because he is a steward of the Mystery: <span
id="fr_4669"></span>[4670](#fn_4669.md) “Verily I say unto you, he shall in
no wise lose his reward.” <span id="fr_4670"></span>[4671](#fn_4670.md) So
understand, he who receiveth a sinner in the name of a sinner shall lose
his reward.

<span id="ii.CIII-p36"></span>11. …On this account therefore be merciful
without fear, extend love even unto thine enemies: punish those who
chance to belong to thy government, restrain them with affection, with
charity, in regard to their eternal salvation; lest while thou sparest
the flesh, the soul perish. Do this: and though thou have to endure
many, <span id="fr_4671"></span>[4672](#fn_4671.md) over whom thou canst
not exercise discipline, because thou hast no lawful authority over
them; bear their injuries; be without apprehension. He will show mercy
unto thee if thou shalt have been merciful: thou shalt be merciful,
without the injuries thou sufferest losing their punishment; “To Me
belongeth vengeance, I will repay,” <span
id="fr_4672"></span>[4673](#fn_4672.md) saith the Lord.

<span id="ii.CIII-p39"></span>12. “He made His ways known unto Moses”
([Psa. 103.7](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#007.md)<span
id="ii.CIII-p39.1"></span>).…For the Law was given with this view, that
the sick might be convinced of his infirmity, and pray for the
physician. This is the hidden way of God. Thou hadst long ago heard,
“Who healeth all thine infirmities.” Their infirmities were as yet
hidden in the sick; the five books were given to Moses: the pool was
surrounded by five porches; he brought forth the sick, that they might
lie there, that they might be made known, not that they might be healed.
The five porches discovered, but healed not, the sick; the pool healed
when one descended, and this when it was disturbed: <span
id="fr_4673"></span>[4674](#fn_4673.md) the disturbance of the pool was in
our Lord’s Passion.…Since therefore this is a mystery there, he teacheth
that the Law was given that sinners might be convinced of their sin, and
call upon the Physician in order to receive grace.…Therefore, as I had
begun to say, because this is a great mystery in the Law, that it was
given with this view, that by the increase of sin, the proud might be
humbled, the humbled might confess, the confessing might be healed;
these are the hidden ways, which He made known to Moses, through whom He
gave the Law, by which sin should abound, that grace might more
abound.…“He hath made known His good pleasure unto the children of
Israel.” To all the children of Israel? To the true children of Israel;
yea, to all the children of Israel. For the treacherous, the insidious,
the hypocrites, are not children of Israel. And who are the children of
Israel? “Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile.”  <span
id="fr_4674"></span>[4675](#fn_4674.md)

<span id="ii.CIII-p42"></span>13. “The Lord is full of compassion and
mercy: long-suffering, and of great mercy” ([Psa.
103.8](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#008.md)<span
id="ii.CIII-p42.1"></span>). Why so long-suffering? Why so great in
mercy? Men sin and live; sins are added on, life continueth: men
blaspheme daily, and “He maketh His sun to rise over the good and the
wicked.” <span id="fr_4675"></span>[4676](#fn_4675.md) On all sides He
calleth to amendment, on all sides He calleth to repentance, He calleth
by the blessings of creation, He calleth by giving time for life, He
calleth through the reader, He calleth through the preacher, He calleth
through the innermost thought by the rod of correction, He calleth by
the mercy of consolation: “He is long-suffering, and of great mercy.”
But take heed lest by ill using the length of God’s mercy, thou treasure
up for thyself, as the Apostle saith, wrath in the day of wrath.…For
some there are who prepare to turn, and yet put it off, and in them
crieth out the raven’s voice, “Cras! Cras!” <span
id="fr_4676"></span>[4677](#fn_4676.md) The raven which was sent from the
ark, never returned. <span id="fr_4677"></span>[4678](#fn_4677.md) God
seeketh not procrastination in the raven’s voice, but confession in the
wailing of the dove. The dove, when sent forth, returned. How long,
To-morrow! To-morrow!? Look to thy last morrow: since thou knowest not
what is thy last morrow, let it suffice that thou hast lived up to this
day a sinner. Thou hast heard, often thou art wont to hear, thou hast
heard to-day also; daily thou hearest, and daily thou amendest not.…

<span id="ii.CIII-p46"></span>14. “He will not alway be chiding: neither
<span id="page_508">p. 508</span> <span
id="ii.CIII-Page_508"></span>keepeth He His anger for ever” ([Psa.
103.9](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#009.md)<span
id="ii.CIII-p46.1"></span>). Since it is in consequence of His anger
that we live in the scourges and corruption <span
id="fr_4678"></span>[4679](#fn_4678.md) of mortality: we have this in
punishment for the first sin.…Is it not through His anger, my brethren,
that “in the sweat of thy face and in toil thou shalt eat bread, and the
earth shall bear thorns and thistles unto thee”? <span
id="fr_4679"></span>[4680](#fn_4679.md) This was said to our forefathers.
Or if our life is different from this; if thou canst, turn unto some
pleasure, where thou mayest not feel thorns. Choose what thou hast
wished, whether thou art covetous or luxurious; to name these two alone;
add a third passion, that of ambition; how great thorns are there in the
desire of honours? in the luxury of lusts how great thorns? in the
ardour of covetousness how great thorns? What troubles are there in base
loves? What terrible anxieties here in this life? I omit hell. Beware
lest thou even now become a hell unto thyself. The whole of this, my
brethren, is the result of His anger: and when thou hast turned thyself
unto works of righteousness, thou canst not but toil upon earth; and
toil endeth not before life endeth. We must toil on the way, that we may
rejoice in our country. He therefore consoleth by His promises thy toil,
thy labours, thy troubles, saying to thee, “He will not alway be
chiding.”

<span id="ii.CIII-p49"></span>15. “He hath not dealt with us according
to our sins” ([Psa. 103.10](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#010.md)<span
id="ii.CIII-p49.1"></span>). Thanks unto God, because He hath vouchsafed
this. We have not received what we were deserving of: “He hath not dealt
with us according to our sins, nor rewarded us according to our
wickednesses.” “For as the height of heaven above the earth, so hath the
Lord confirmed His mercy toward them that fear Him” ([Psa.
103.11](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#011.md)<span
id="ii.CIII-p49.2"></span>). Observe the heaven: everywhere on every
side it covereth the earth, nor is there any part of the earth not
covered by the heaven. Men sin beneath heaven: they do all evil deeds
beneath the heaven; yet they are covered by the heaven. Thence is light
for the eyes, thence air, thence breath, thence rain upon the earth for
the sake of its fruits, thence all mercy from heaven. Take away the aid
of heaven from the earth: it will fail at once. As then the protection
of heaven abideth upon the earth, so doth the Lord’s protection abide
upon them that fear Him. Thou fearest God, His protection is above thee.
But perhaps thou art scourged, and conceivest that God hath forsaken
thee. God hath forsaken thee, <span id="fr_4680"></span>[4681](#fn_4680.md)
if the protection of heaven hath forsaken the earth.

<span id="ii.CIII-p51"></span>16. “Look, how wide the east is from the
west; so far hath He set our sins from us” ([Psa.
103.12](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#012.md)<span
id="ii.CIII-p51.1"></span>). They who know the Sacraments know this;
nevertheless, I only say what all may hear. <span
id="fr_4681"></span>[4682](#fn_4681.md) When sin is remitted, thy sins
fall, thy grace riseth; thy sins are as it were on the decline, thy
grace which freeth thee on the rise. “Truth springeth from the
earth.” <span id="fr_4682"></span>[4683](#fn_4682.md) What meaneth this?
Thy grace is born, thy sins fall, thou art in a certain manner made new.
Thou shouldest look to the rising, and turn away from the setting. <span
id="fr_4683"></span>[4684](#fn_4683.md) Turn away from thy sins, turn unto
the grace of God; when thy sins fall, thou riseth and profitest.…One
region of the heaven falleth, another riseth: but the region which is
now rising will set after twelve hours. Not like this is the grace which
riseth unto us: both our sins fall for ever, and grace abideth for ever.

<span id="ii.CIII-p55"></span>17. “Yea, like as a father pitieth his own
children, even so hath the Lord had mercy on them that fear Him” ([Psa.
103.13](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#013.md)<span
id="ii.CIII-p55.1"></span>). Let Him be as angry as He shall will, He is
our Father. But He hath scourged us, and afflicted us, and bruised us:
He is our Father. Son, if thou bewailest, wail beneath thy Father; do
not so with indignation, do not so with the puffing up of pride. What
thou sufferest, whence thou mournest, it is medicine, not punishment; it
is thy chastening, not thy condemnation. Do not refuse the scourge, if
thou dost not wish to be refused thy heritage: do not think of what
punishment thou sufferest in the scourge, but what place thou hast in
the Testament.

<span id="ii.CIII-p56"></span>18. “For He knoweth our forming” <span
id="fr_4684"></span>[4685](#fn_4684.md) ([Psa.
103.14](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#014.md)<span
id="ii.CIII-p57.1"></span>): that is, our infirmity. He knoweth what He
hath created, how it hath fallen, how it may be repaired, how it may be
adopted, how it may be enriched. Behold, we are made of clay: “The first
man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is the Lord from
heaven.” <span id="fr_4685"></span>[4686](#fn_4685.md) He sent even His own
Son, Him who was made the second man, Him who was God before all things.
For He was second in His coming, first in His returning: He died after
many, He arose before all. “He knoweth our forming.” What forming?
Ourselves. Why sayest thou that He knoweth? Because He hath pitied.
“Remember that we are but dust.” Addressing God Himself, he saith,
“Remember,” as if God could forget: He perceiveth, He knoweth in such a
manner that He cannot forget. But what meaneth, “Remember”? Let thy
mercy continue towards us. Thou knowest our forming; forget not our
forming, lest we forget thy grace.

<span id="ii.CIII-p59"></span>19. “Man, his days are but as grass”
([Psa. 103.15](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#015.md)<span
id="ii.CIII-p59.1"></span>). Let man consider what he is; let not man be
proud. “His days are but as grass.” Why is the grass proud, that is now
flourishing, and in a very short space dried up? Why is the <span
id="page_509">p. 509</span> <span id="ii.CIII-Page_509"></span>grass
proud that flourisheth only for a brief season, until the sun be hot? It
is then good for us that His mercy be upon us, and from grass make gold.
“For he flourisheth as a flower of the field.” The whole splendour of
the human race; honour, powers, riches, pride, threats, is the flower of
the grass. That house flourisheth, and that family is great, that family
flourisheth; and how many flourish, and how many years do they live!
Many years to thee, are but a short season unto God. God doth not count,
as thou dost. Compared with the length and long life of ages, all the
flower of any house is as the flower of the field. All the beauty of the
year hardly lasteth for the year. Whatever there flourisheth, whatever
there is warmed with heat, whatever there is beautiful, lasteth not;
nay, it cannot exist for one whole year. In how brief a season do
flowers pass away, and these are the beauty of the herbs! This which is
so very beautiful, this quickly falleth. <span
id="fr_4686"></span>[4687](#fn_4686.md) Inasmuch then as He knoweth as a
father our forming, that we are but grass, and can only flourish for a
time; He sent unto us His Word, and His Word, which abideth for
evermore, He hath made a brother unto the grass which abideth not.
Wonder not that thou shalt be a sharer of His Eternity; He became
Himself first a sharer of thy grass. Will He who assumed from thee what
was lowly, deny unto thee what is exalted in respect of thee?

<span id="ii.CIII-p61"></span>20. “The wind shall go over on it, it
shall not be; and the place thereof shall know it no more” ([Psa.
103.16](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#016.md)<span
id="ii.CIII-p61.1"></span>). For he is not speaking of grass, but of
that for whose sake even the Word became grass. For thou art man, and on
thy account the Word became man. “All flesh is grass:” “and the Word was
made flesh.” <span id="fr_4687"></span>[4688](#fn_4687.md) How great then
is the hope of the grass, since the Word hath been made flesh? That
which abideth for evermore, hath not disdained to assume grass, that the
grass might not despair of itself.

<span id="ii.CIII-p63"></span>21. In thy reflections therefore on
thyself, think of thy low estate, think of thy dust: be not lifted up:
if thou art anything better, thou wilt be so by His Grace, thou wilt be
so by His mercy. For hear what followeth: “but the mercy of the Lord
endureth for ever and ever upon them that fear Him” ([Psa.
103.17](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#017.md)<span
id="ii.CIII-p63.1"></span>). Ye who fear not Him, will be grass, and in
grass, and in torment with the grass: for the flesh shall arise unto the
torment. Let those who fear Him rejoice, because His mercy is upon them.

<span id="ii.CIII-p64"></span>22. “And His righteousness upon children’s
children” ([Psa. 103.18](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#018.md)<span
id="ii.CIII-p64.1"></span>). He speaketh of reward, “upon children’s
children.” How many servants of God are there who have not children, how
much less children’s children? But He calleth our works our children;
the reward of works, our “children’s children.” “Even upon such as keep
His covenant.” Let men beware that all may not conceive what is here
said to belong to themselves: let them choose, while they have the
choice. “And keep in memory His commandments to do them.” Thou wast
already disposed to flatter thyself, and perhaps to recite to me the
Psalter, which I have not by heart, or from memory to say over the whole
Law. Clearly thou art better in point of memory than I, better than any
righteous man who doth not know the Law word for word: but see that thou
keep the commandments. But how shouldest thou keep them? Not by memory,
but by life. “Such as keep in memory His commandments:” not, to recite
them; but, “to do them.” And now perhaps each man’s soul is disturbed.
Who remembereth all the commandments of God? who remembereth all the
writings of God? Lo, I wish not only to hold them in my memory, but also
to do them in my works: but who remembereth them all? Fear not: He
burdeneth thee not: “on two commandments hang all the Law and the
Prophets.” <span id="fr_4688"></span>[4689](#fn_4688.md) …

<span id="ii.CIII-p66"></span>23. “The Lord hath prepared His throne in
heaven” ([Psa. 103.19](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#019.md)<span
id="ii.CIII-p66.1"></span>). Who but Christ hath prepared His throne in
heaven? He who descended and ascended, He who died, and rose from the
dead, He who lifted up to heaven the manhood He had assumed, hath
Himself prepared His throne in heaven. The throne is the seat of the
Judge: observe therefore ye who hear, that “He hath prepared His throne
in heaven.”…The kingdom is the Lord’s, and He shall be the Governor
among the people. <span id="fr_4689"></span>[4690](#fn_4689.md) “And His
kingdom shall rule over all.”

<span id="ii.CIII-p68"></span>24. “Bless ye the Lord, ye Angels of His,
ye that are mighty in strength: ye that fulfil His word” ([Psa.
103.20](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#020.md)<span
id="ii.CIII-p68.1"></span>). By the word of God, then, thou art not
righteous, nor faithful, unless when thou dost it. “Ye that are mighty
in strength, ye that fulfil His commandment, and hearken unto the voice
of His words.”

<span id="ii.CIII-p69"></span>25. “Bless ye the Lord, all ye His hosts:
ye servants of His that do His pleasure” ([Psa.
103.21](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#021.md)<span
id="ii.CIII-p69.1"></span>). All ye angels, all ye that are mighty in
strength: ye that do His word: all ye His hosts, ye servants of His that
do His pleasure, do ye, ye bless the Lord. For all they who live
wickedly, though their tongues be silent, by their lips do curse the
Lord. What doth it profit if thy tongue singeth a hymn, while thy life
breatheth sacrilege? By living ill thou hast set many tongues to
blasphemy. Thy tongue is given to the hymn, the tongues of those who
behold thee, to blasphemy. If then thou dost wish to bless the Lord, do
His word, do His will.…

<span id="ii.CIII-p70"></span><span id="page_510">p. 510</span> <span
id="ii.CIII-Page_510"></span>26. “Bless ye the Lord, all ye works of
His, in all places of His dominion” ([Psa.
103.22](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#022.md)<span
id="ii.CIII-p70.1"></span>). Therefore in every place. Let Him not be
blessed where He ruleth not: “in all places of His dominion.” Let no man
perchance say: I cannot praise the Lord in the East, because He hath
departed unto the West; or, I cannot praise Him in the West, because He
is in the East. “For neither from the east, nor from the west, nor yet
from the desert hills. And why? God is the Judge.” <span
id="fr_4690"></span>[4691](#fn_4690.md) He is everywhere, in such wise that
everywhere He may be praised: He is in such wise on every side, that we
may be joyful in Him on every side: He is in such wise blessed on every
side, that on every side we may live well.…“In every place of His
dominion: bless thou the Lord, O my soul!” The last verse is the same as
the first: blessing is at the head of the Psalm, blessing at the end;
from blessing we set out, to blessing let us return, in blessing let us
reign.  <span id="fr_4691"></span>[4692](#fn_4691.md)
