<span id="ii.LI-p1"></span> <span id="ii.LI-p1.1"></span><span
class="c20"><span id="ii.LI-p1.2"></span>Psalm LI. <span
id="fr_1802"></span>[1803](#fn_1802.md) </span>

<span id="ii.LI-p3"></span>1. Neither must this multitude’s throng be
defrauded, nor their infirmity burthened. Silence we ask, and quiet, in
order that our voice, after yesterday’s labour, be able with some little
vigour to last out. It must be believed, that your love hath met
together in greater numbers to-day for nothing else, but that ye may
pray for those whom an alien and perverse inclination doth keep away.
For we are speaking neither of heathens nor of Jews, but of Christians:
nor of those that are yet Catechumens, but of many that are even
baptized, from the Laver of whom ye do no wise differ, and yet to their
heart ye are unlike. For to-day how many brethren of ours we think of,
and deplore their going unto vanities and lying insanities, to the
neglect of that to which they have been called. Who, if in the very
circus from any cause they chance to be startled, do immediately cross
themselves, <span id="fr_1803"></span>[1804](#fn_1803.md) and stand bearing
It on the forehead, in the very place, from whence they had withdrawn,
if they had borne It in heart. God’s mercy must be implored, that He may
give understanding for condemning these things, inclination to flee
them, and mercy to forgive. Opportunately, then, of Penitence a Psalm
to-day has been chanted. Speak we even with the absent: there will be to
them for our voice your memory. Neglect not the wounded and feeble, but
that ye may more easily make whole, whole ye ought to abide. Correct by
reproving, comfort by addressing, set an example by living well, He will
be with them that hath been with you. For now that ye have overpassed
these dangers, the fountain of God’s mercy is not closed. Where ye have
come they will come; where ye have passed they will pass. A grievous
thing it is indeed, and exceeding perilous, nay ruinous, and for certain
a deadly thing, that witting they sin. For in one way to these vanities
doth he run that despiseth the voice of Christ; in another way, he that
knoweth from what he is fleeing. But that not even of such men we ought
to despair, this Psalm doth show.

<span id="ii.LI-p5"></span>2. For there is written over it the title
thereof, “A Psalm of David himself, when there came to him Nathan the
prophet, when he went in unto Bersabee.” Bersabee was a woman, wife of
<span id="page_190">p. 190</span> <span
id="ii.LI-Page_190"></span>another. With grief indeed we speak, and with
trembling; but yet God would not have to be hushed what He hath willed
to be written. I will say then not what I will, but what I am obliged; I
will say not as one exhorting to imitation, but as one instructing you
to fear. Captivated with this woman’s beauty, the wife of another, the
king and prophet David, from whose seed according to the flesh the Lord
was to come, <span id="fr_1804"></span>[1805](#fn_1804.md) committed
adultery with her. This thing in this Psalm is not read, but in the
title thereof it appeareth; but in the book of Kings <span
id="fr_1805"></span>[1806](#fn_1805.md) it is more fully read. Both
Scriptures are canonical, to both without any doubt by Christians credit
must be given. The sin was committed, and was written down. Moreover her
husband in war he caused to be killed: and after this deed there was
sent to him Nathan the prophet; <span
id="fr_1806"></span>[1807](#fn_1806.md) sent by the Lord, to reprove him
for so great an outrage.

<span id="ii.LI-p9"></span>3. What men should beware of, we have said;
but what if they shall have fallen they should imitate, let us hear. For
many men will to fall with David, and will not to rise with David. Not
then for falling is the example set forth, but if thou shalt have fallen
for rising again. Take heed lest thou fall. Not the delight of the
younger be the lapse of the elder, but be the fall of the elder the
dread of the younger. For this it was set forth, for this was written,
for this in the Church often read and chanted: let them hear that have
not fallen, lest they fall; let them hear that have fallen, that they
may rise. So great a man’s sin is not hushed, is proclaimed in the
Church. There men hear that are ill hearers, and seek for themselves
countenance for sinning: they look out for means whereby they may defend
what they have made ready to commit, not how they may beware of what
they have not committed, and they say to themselves, If David, why not I
too? Thence that soul is more unrighteous, which, forasmuch as it hath
done it because David did, therefore hath done worse than David. I will
say this very thing, if I shall be able, more plainly. David had set
forth to himself none for a precedent as thou hast: he had fallen by
lapse of concupiscence, not by the countenance of holiness: thou dost
set before thine eyes as it were a holy man, in order that thou mayest
sin: thou dost not copy his holiness, but dost copy his fall. Thou <span
id="fr_1807"></span>[1808](#fn_1807.md) dost love that in David, which in
himself David hated: thou makest thee ready to sin, thou inclinest to
sin: in order that thou mayest sin thou consultest the book of God: the
Scriptures of God for this thou hearest, that thou mayest do what
displeaseth God. This did not David; he was reproved by a Prophet, he
stumbled not over a Prophet. But others hearing to their health, by the
fall of a strong man measure their weakness: and desiring to avoid what
God condemneth, from careless looking do restrain their eyes. Them they
fix not upon the beauty of another’s flesh, nor make themselves careless
with perverse simpleness; they say not, “With good intent I have
observed, of kindness I have observed, of charity I have long looked.”
For they set before themselves the fall of David, and they see that this
great man for this purpose hath fallen, in order that little men may not
be willing to look on that whereby they may fall. For they restrain
their eyes from wantonness, not readily do they join themselves in
company, they do not mingle with strange women, they raise not complying
eyes to strange balconies, to strange terraces. For from afar David saw
her with whom he was captivated. <span
id="fr_1808"></span>[1809](#fn_1808.md) Woman afar, lust near. What he saw
was elsewhere, in himself that whereby he fell. This weakness of the
flesh must be therefore minded, the words of the Apostle recollected,
“Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body.” <span
id="fr_1809"></span>[1810](#fn_1809.md) He hath not said, let there not be;
but, “let there not reign.” There is sin in thee, when thou takest
pleasure; there reigneth, if thou shalt have consented. Carnal pleasure,
especially if proceeding unto unlawful and strange objects, is to be
bridled, not let loose: by government to be tamed, not to be set up for
government. Look and be without care, if thou hast nothing whereby thou
mayest be moved. But thou makest answer, “I contain with strong
resolution.” Art thou any wise stronger than David? <span
id="fr_1810"></span>[1811](#fn_1810.md)

<span id="ii.LI-p14"></span>4. He admonisheth, moreover, by such an
example, that no one ought to lift himself up in prosperous
circumstances. For many fear adverse circumstances, fear not prosperous
circumstances. Prosperity is more perilous to soul than adversity to
body. First, prosperity doth corrupt, in order that adversity may find
something to break. My brethren, stricter watch must be kept against
felicity. Wherefore, see ye after what manner the saying of God amid our
own felicity doth take from us security: “Serve ye,” He saith, “the Lord
in fear, and exult unto Him with trembling.” <span
id="fr_1811"></span>[1812](#fn_1811.md) In exultation, in order that we may
render thanks; in trembling, lest we fall. This sin did not David, when
he was suffering Saul for persecutor. <span
id="fr_1812"></span>[1813](#fn_1812.md) When holy David was suffering Saul
his enemy, when he was being vexed by his persecutions, when he was
fleeing through divers places, in order that he might not fall into his
hands, he lusted not for her that was another’s, he slew not husband
after committing adultery with wife. He was in the infirmity of his
tribulation so much the more intimate with God as <span id="page_191">p.
191</span> <span id="ii.LI-Page_191"></span>he seemed more miserable.
Something useful is tribulation; useful the surgeon’s lancet rather than
the devil’s temptation. He became secure when his enemies were
overthrown, pressure was removed, swelling grew out. This example
therefore doth avail to this end, that we should fear felicity.
“Tribulation,” he saith, “and grief I found, and on the name of the Lord
I called.” <span id="fr_1813"></span>[1814](#fn_1813.md)

<span id="ii.LI-p18"></span>5. But it was done; I would say these words
to those that have not done the like, in order that they should watch to
keep their uncorruptness, and that while they take heed how a great one
has fallen, they that be small should fear. But if any that hath already
fallen heareth these words, and that hath in his conscience any evil
thing; to the words of this Psalm let him advert; let him heed the
greatness of the wound, but not despair of the majesty of the Physician.
Sin with despair is certain death. Let no one therefore say, If already
any evil thing I have done, already I am to be condemned: God pardoneth
not such evil things, why add I not sins to sins? I will enjoy this word
in pleasure, in wantonness, in wicked cupidity: now hope of amendment
having been lost, let me have even what I see, if I cannot have what I
believe. This Psalm then, while it maketh heedful those that have not
believed, so doth not will them that have fallen to be despaired of.
Whoever thou art that hast sinned, and hesitatest to exercise
penitence <span id="fr_1814"></span>[1815](#fn_1814.md) for thy sin,
despairing of thy salvation, hear David groaning. To thee Nathan the
prophet hath not been sent, David himself hath been sent to thee. Hear
him crying, and with him cry: hear him groaning, and with him groan;
hear him weeping, and mingle tears; hear him amended, and with him
rejoice. If from thee sin could not be excluded, be not hope of pardon
excluded. There was sent to that man Nathan the prophet, observe the
king’s humility.  <span id="fr_1815"></span>[1816](#fn_1815.md) He rejected
not the words of him giving admonition, he said not, Darest thou speak
to me, a king? An exalted king heard a prophet, let His humble people
hear Christ.

<span id="ii.LI-p21"></span>6. Hear therefore these words, and say thou
with him: “Have pity upon me, O God, after Thy great mercy” ([Psa.
51.1](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#001)<span id="ii.LI-p21.1"></span>.md).
He that imploreth great mercy, confesseth great misery. Let them seek a
little mercy of Thee, that have sinned in ignorance: “Have pity,” he
saith, “upon me, after Thy great mercy.” Relieve a deep wound after Thy
great healing. Deep is what I have, but in the Almighty I take refuge.
Of my own so deadly wound I should despair, unless I could find so great
a Physician. “Have pity upon me, O God, after Thy great mercy: and after
the multitude of Thy pities, blot out my iniquity.” What he saith, “Blot
out my iniquity,” is this, “Have pity upon me, O God.” And what he
saith, “After the multitude of Thy pities,” is this, “After Thy great
mercy.” Because great is the mercy, many are the mercies; and of Thy
great mercy, many are Thy pitying. Thou dost regard mockers to amend
them, dost regard ignorant men to teach them, dost regard men confessing
to pardon. Did he this in ignorance? A certain man had done some, aye
many evil things he had done; “Mercy,” he saith, “I obtained, because
ignorant I did it in unbelief.” <span
id="fr_1816"></span>[1817](#fn_1816.md) This David could not say, “Ignorant
I did it.” For he was not ignorant how very evil a thing was the
touching of another’s wife, and how very evil a thing was the killing of
the husband, who knew not of it, and was not even angered. They obtain
therefore the mercy of the Lord that have in ignorance done it; and they
that have knowing done it, obtain not any mercy it may chance, but
“great mercy.”

<span id="ii.LI-p23"></span>7. “More and more wash me from mine
unrighteousness” ([Psa. 51.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#002.md)<span
id="ii.LI-p23.1"></span>). What is, “More and more wash”? One much
stained. More and more wash the sins of one knowing. Thou that hast
washed off the sins of one ignorant. Not even thus is it to be despaired
of Thy mercy. “And from my delinquency purge Thou me.” According to the
manner in which He is physician, offer a recompense. He is God, offer
sacrifice. What wilt thou give that thou mayest be purged? For see upon
whom thou callest; upon a Just One thou callest. He hateth sins, if He
is just; He taketh vengeance upon sins, if He is just; thou wilt not be
able to take away from the Lord God His justice: entreat mercy, but
observe the justice: there is mercy to pardon the sinner, there is
justice to punish the sin. What then? Thou askest mercy; shall sin
unpunished abide? Let David answer, let those that have fallen answer,
answer with David, and say, No, Lord, no sin of mine shall be
unpunished; I know the justice of Him whose mercy I ask: it shall not be
unpunished, but for this reason I will not that Thou punish me, because
I punish my sin: for this reason I beg that Thou pardon, because I
acknowledge.

<span id="ii.LI-p24"></span>8. “For mine iniquity I acknowledge, and my
delinquency is before me ever” ([Psa.
51.3](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#003)<span id="ii.LI-p24.1"></span>.md). I
have not put behind my back what I have done, I look not at others,
forgetful of myself, I pretend not to pull out a straw from my brother’s
eye, when there is a beam in my eye; <span
id="fr_1817"></span>[1818](#fn_1817.md) my sin is before me, not behind me.
For it was behind me when to me was sent the Prophet, and set before me
the parable of the poor man’s sheep. <span
id="fr_1818"></span>[1819](#fn_1818.md) For saith Nathan the Prophet to
David, “There <span id="page_192">p. 192</span> <span
id="ii.LI-Page_192"></span>was a certain rich man having very many
sheep; but a poor man his neighbour had one little ewe sheep, which in
his bosom and of his own food he was feeding: there came a stranger to
the rich man, nothing from his flock he took, for the lithe ewe sheep of
the poor man his neighbour he lusted; her he slew for the stranger: what
doth he deserve?” But the other being angry doth pronounce sentence:
then the king, evidently knowing not wherein he had been taken, <span
id="fr_1819"></span>[1820](#fn_1819.md) declared the rich man deserving of
death, and that the sheep be restored fourfold. Most sternly and most
justly. But his sin was not yet before him, behind his back was what he
had done: his own iniquity he did not yet acknowledge, and therefore
another’s he did not pardon. But the Prophet, being for this purpose
sent, took from his back the sin, and before his eyes placed it, so that
he might see that sentence so stern to have been pronounced against
himself. For cutting and healing his heart’s wound, he made a lancet of
his tongue.…

<span id="ii.LI-p28"></span>9. “Against Thee alone have I sinned, and
before Thee an evil thing have I done” ([Psa.
51.4](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#004)<span id="ii.LI-p28.1"></span>.md).
What is this? For before men was not another’s wife debauched and
husband slain? Did not all men know what David had done? <span
id="fr_1820"></span>[1821](#fn_1820.md) What is, “Against Thee alone have I
sinned, and before Thee an evil thing have I done.” Because Thou alone
art without sin. He is a just punisher that hath nothing in Him to be
punished; He is a just reprover that hath nothing in Him to be reproved.
“That thou mayest be justified in Thy sayings, and conquer when Thou art
judged.” To whom he speaketh, brethren, to whom he speaketh, is
difficult to understand. To God surely he speaketh, and it is evident
that God the Father is not judged. What is, “And conquer when Thou art
judged”? He seeth the future Judge to be judged, one just by sinners to
be judged, and therein conquering, because in Him was nothing to be
judged. For alone among men could truly say the God-Man, “If ye have
found in Me sin, say.” <span id="fr_1821"></span>[1822](#fn_1821.md) But
perchance there was what escaped men, and they found not what was really
there, but was not manifest. In another place <span
id="fr_1822"></span>[1823](#fn_1822.md) He saith, “Behold there cometh the
Prince of the world,” being an acute observer of all sins; “Behold,” He
saith, “there cometh the Prince of this world,” with death afflicting
sinners, presiding over death: for, “By the malice of the devil death
came into the world.” <span id="fr_1823"></span>[1824](#fn_1823.md)
“Behold,” He saith, “there cometh the Prince of the world:”—He said
these words close upon His Passion:—“and in Me he shall find nothing,”
nothing of sin, nothing worthy of death, nothing worthy of condemnation.
And as if it were said to Him, Why then dost Thou die? He continueth and
saith, “But that all men may know that I do the will of My Father;
arise, let us go hence.” I suffer, He saith, undeserving, for men
deserving, in order that them I may make deserving of My Life, for whom
I undeservedly suffer their death. To Him then, having no sin, saith on
the present occasion the Prophet David, “Against Thee only have I
sinned, and before Thee an evil thing have I done, that Thou mayest be
justified in Thy sayings, and conquer when Thou art judged.” For Thou
overcomest all men, all judges; and he that deemeth himself just, before
Thee is unjust: Thou alone justly judgest, having been unjustly judged,
That hast power to lay down Thy life, and hast power again to take
it. <span id="fr_1824"></span>[1825](#fn_1824.md) Thou conquerest, then,
when Thou art judged. All men Thou overcomest, because Thou art more
than men, and by Thee were men made.

<span id="ii.LI-p34"></span>10. “For, behold, in iniquities I was
conceived” ([Psa. 51.5](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#005.md)<span
id="ii.LI-p34.1"></span>). As though he were saying, They are conquered
that have done what thou, David, hast done: for this is not a little
evil and little sin, to wit, adultery and man-slaying. What of them that
from the day that they were born of their mother’s womb, have done no
such thing? even to them dost thou ascribe some sins, in order that He
may conquer all men when He beginneth to be judged. David hath taken
upon him the person of mankind, and hath heeded the bonds of all men,
hath considered the offspring of death, hath adverted to the origin of
iniquity, and he saith, “For, behold, in iniquities I was conceived.”
Was David born of adultery; being born of Jesse, <span
id="fr_1825"></span>[1826](#fn_1825.md) a righteous man, and his own wife?
What is it that he saith himself to have been in iniquity conceived,
except that iniquity is drawn from Adam? Even the very bond of death,
with iniquity itself is engrained? No man is born without bringing
punishment, bringing desert of punishment. A Prophet saith also in
another place, <span id="fr_1826"></span>[1827](#fn_1826.md) “No one is
clean in Thy sight, not even an infant, whose life is of one day upon
earth.” For we know both by the Baptism of Christ that sins are loosed,
and that the Baptism of Christ availeth the remission of sins. If
infants are every way innocent, why do mothers run with them when sick
to the Church? <span id="fr_1827"></span>[1828](#fn_1827.md) What by that
Baptism, what by that remission is put away? An innocent one I see that
rather weeps than is angry. What doth Baptism wash off? what doth that
Grace loose? There is loosed the offspring of sin. For if that infant
could speak to thee, it would say, and if it had the understanding which
David had, it would answer thee, Why <span id="page_193">p. 193</span>
<span id="ii.LI-Page_193"></span>heedest thou me, an infant? Thou dost
not indeed see my actions: but I in iniquity have been conceived, “And
in sins hath my mother nourished me in the womb.”

<span id="ii.LI-p38"></span>Apart from this bond of mortal <span
id="fr_1828"></span>[1829](#fn_1828.md) concupiscence was Christ born
without a male, of a virgin conceiving by the Holy Ghost. He cannot be
said to have been conceived in iniquity, it cannot be said, In sins His
mother nourished Him in the womb, to whom was said, “The Holy Ghost
shall come upon thee, and the Virtue of the Highest shall overshadow
thee.” <span id="fr_1829"></span>[1830](#fn_1829.md) It is not therefore
because it is sin to have to do with wives that men are conceived in
iniquity, and in sins nourished in the womb by their mother; but because
that which is made is surely made of flesh deserving punishment. <span
id="fr_1830"></span>[1831](#fn_1830.md) For the punishment of the flesh is
death, and surely there is in it liability to death itself. Whence the
Apostle spoke not of the body as if to die, but as if dead: “The body
indeed is dead,” he saith, “because of sin, but the Spirit is life
because of righteousness.” <span id="fr_1831"></span>[1832](#fn_1831.md)
How then without bond of sin is born that which is conceived and sown of
a body dead because of sin? This chaste operation in a married person
hath not sin, but the origin of sin draweth with it condign punishment.
For there is no husband that, because he is an husband, is not subject
to death, or that is subject to death for any other reason but because
of sin. For even the Lord was subject to death, but not on account of
sin: He took upon Him our punishment, and so looseth our guilt. With
reason then, “In Adam all die, but in Christ shall all be made
alive.” <span id="fr_1832"></span>[1833](#fn_1832.md) For, “Through one
man,” saith the Apostle, “sin hath entered into this world, and through
sin death, and so hath passed unto all men, in that all have
sinned.” <span id="fr_1833"></span>[1834](#fn_1833.md) Definite is the
sentence: “In Adam,” he saith, “all have sinned.” Alone then could such
an infant be innocent, as hath not been born of the work of Adam.

<span id="ii.LI-p45"></span>11. “For, behold, truth Thou hast loved:
uncertain and hidden things of Thy wisdom, Thou hast manifested to me”
([Psa. 51.6](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#006.md)<span
id="ii.LI-p45.1"></span>). That is, Thou hast not left unpunished even
the sins of those whom Thou dost pardon. “Truth Thou hast loved:” so
mercy Thou hast granted first, <span
id="fr_1834"></span>[1835](#fn_1834.md) as that Thou shouldest also
preserve truth. Thou pardonest one confessing, pardonest, but only if he
punisheth himself: so there are preserved mercy and truth: mercy because
man is set free; truth, because sin is punished. “Uncertain and hidden
things of Thy wisdom Thou hast manifested to me.” What “hidden things”?
What “uncertain things”? Because God pardoneth even such. Nothing is so
hidden, nothing so uncertain. <span id="fr_1835"></span>[1836](#fn_1835.md)
For this uncertainty the Ninevites repented, for they said, though after
the threatenings of the Prophet, though after that cry, “Three days and
Nineve shall be overthrown:” <span id="fr_1836"></span>[1837](#fn_1836.md)
they said to themselves, Mercy must be implored; they said in this sort
reasoning among themselves, “Who knoweth whether God may turn for the
better His sentence, and have pity?” <span
id="fr_1837"></span>[1838](#fn_1837.md) It was “uncertain,” when it is
said, “Who knoweth?” on an uncertainty they did repent, <span
id="fr_1838"></span>[1839](#fn_1838.md) certain mercy they earned: they
prostrated them in tears, in fastings, in sackcloth and ashes they
prostrated them, groaned, wept, God spared. Nineve stood: was Nineve
overthrown? One way indeed it seemeth to men, and another way it seemed
to God. But I think that it was fulfilled that the Prophet had foretold.
Regard what Nineve was, and see how it was overthrown; overthrown in
evil, builded in good; just as Saul the persecutor was overthrown, Paul
the preacher builded.  <span id="fr_1839"></span>[1840](#fn_1839.md) Who
would not say that this city, in which we now are, was happily
overthrown, if all those madmen, leaving their triflings, <span
id="fr_1840"></span>[1841](#fn_1840.md) were to run together to the Church
with contrite heart, and were to call upon God’s mercy for their past
doings? Should we not say, Where is that Carthage? Because there is not
what there was, it is overthrown: but if there is what there was not, it
is builded. So is said to Jeremiah, “Behold, I will give to thee to root
up, to dig under, to overthrow, to destroy,” and again, “to build, and
to plant.” <span id="fr_1841"></span>[1842](#fn_1841.md) Thence is that
voice of the Lord, “I will smite and I will heal.” <span
id="fr_1842"></span>[1843](#fn_1842.md) He smiteth the rottenness of the
deed, He healeth the pain of the wound. Physicians do thus when they
cut; they smite and heal; they arm themselves in order to strike, they
carry steel, and come to cure. But because great were the sins of the
Ninevites, they said, “Who knoweth?” This uncertainty had God disclosed
to His servant David. For when he had said, before the Prophet standing
and convicting him, “I have sinned:” straightway he heard from the
Prophet, that is, from the Spirit of God which was in the Prophet, “Thy
sin is put away from thee.” <span id="fr_1843"></span>[1844](#fn_1843.md)
“Uncertain and hidden things” of His wisdom He manifested to him. <span
id="fr_1844"></span>[1845](#fn_1844.md)

<span id="ii.LI-p57"></span>12. “Thou shalt sprinkle me,” he saith,
“with hyssop, and I shall be cleansed” ([Psa.
51.7](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#007)<span id="ii.LI-p57.1"></span>.md).
Hyssop we know to be a herb humble but heal<span id="page_194">p.
194</span> <span id="ii.LI-Page_194"></span>ing: to the rock it is said
to adhere with roots. Thence in a mystery the similitude of cleansing
the heart has been taken. Do thou also take hold, with <span
id="fr_1845"></span>[1846](#fn_1845.md) the root of thy love, on thy Rock:
be humble in thy humble God, in order that thou mayest be exalted in thy
glorified God. Thou shalt be sprinkled with hyssop, the humility of
Christ shall cleanse thee. Despise not the herb, attend to the efficacy
of the medicine. Something further I will say, which we are wont to hear
from physicians, or to experience in sick persons. Hyssop, they say, is
proper for purging the lungs. In the lung is wont to be noted pride: for
there is inflation, there breathing. It was said of Saul the persecutor
as of Saul the proud, that he was going to bind Christians, breathing
slaughter: <span id="fr_1846"></span>[1847](#fn_1846.md) he was breathing
out slaughter, breathing out blood, his lung not yet cleansed. Hear also
in this place one humbled, because with hyssop purged: “Thou shalt wash
me,” that is, shalt cleanse me: “and above snow I shall be whitened.”
“Although,” he saith, “your sins shall have been like scarlet, like snow
I will whiten.” <span id="fr_1847"></span>[1848](#fn_1847.md) Out of such
men Christ doth present to Himself a vesture without spot and
wrinkle. <span id="fr_1848"></span>[1849](#fn_1848.md) Further, His vesture
on the mount, which shone forth like whitened snow, <span
id="fr_1849"></span>[1850](#fn_1849.md) signified the Church cleansed from
every spot of sin.

<span id="ii.LI-p63"></span>13. But where is humility from hyssop? Hear
what followeth: “To my hearing Thou shall give exultation and gladness,
and bones humbled shall exult” ([Psa.
51.8](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#008)<span id="ii.LI-p63.1"></span>.md). I
will rejoice in hearing Thee, not in speaking against Thee. Thou hast
sinned, why defendest thou thyself? Thou wilt speak: suffer thou; hear,
yield to divine words, lest thou be put to confusion, and be still more
wounded: sin hath been committed, be it not defended: to confession let
it come, not to defence. Thou engagest thyself as defender of thy sin,
thou art conquered: no innocent patron hast thou engaged, thy defence is
not profitable to thee. For who art thou that defendest thyself? Thou
art meet to accuse thyself. Say not, either, “I have done nothing;” or,
“What great thing have I done?” or, “Other men as well have done.” If in
doing sin thou sayest thou hast done nothing, thou wilt be nothing, thou
wilt receive nothing: God is ready to give indulgence, thou closest the
door against thyself: He is ready to give, do not oppose the bar of
defence, but open the bosom of confession. “To my hearing Thou shalt
give exultation and gladness.”…

<span id="ii.LI-p64"></span>14. “Turn Thou away Thy face from my sins,
and all mine iniquities blot out” ([Psa.
51.9](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#009)<span id="ii.LI-p64.1"></span>.md).
For now bones humbled exult, now with hyssop cleansed, humble I have
become. “Turn Thou away Thy face,” not from me, but “from my sins.” For
in another place praying he saith, “Turn not away Thy face from
me.” <span id="fr_1850"></span>[1851](#fn_1850.md) He that would not that
God’s face be turned away from himself, would that God’s face be turned
away from his sins. For to sin, when God turneth not Himself away, he
adverteth: if he adverteth, he animadverteth. “And all mine iniquities
blot out.” He is busied <span id="fr_1851"></span>[1852](#fn_1851.md) with
that capital sin: he reckoneth on more, he would have all his iniquities
to be blotted out: he relieth on the Physician’s hand, on that “great
mercy,” upon which he hath called in the beginning of the Psalm: “All
mine iniquities blot out.” God turneth away His face, and so blotteth
out; by “turning away” His face, sins He blotteth out. By “turning
towards,” He writeth them. Thou hast heard of Him blotting out by
turning away, hear of Him by turning towards, doing what? “But the
countenance of the Lord is upon men doing evil things, that He may
destroy from the earth the remembrance of them:” <span
id="fr_1852"></span>[1853](#fn_1852.md) He shall destroy the remembrance of
them, <span id="fr_1853"></span>[1854](#fn_1853.md) not by “blotting out
their sins.” But here he doth ask what? “Turn away Thy face from my
sins.” Well he asketh. For he himself doth not turn away his face from
his *own* sins, saying, “For my sin I acknowledge.” With reason thou
askest and well askest, that God turn away from thy sin, if thou from
thence dost not turn away thy face: but if thou settest thy sin at thy
back, God doth there set His face. Do thou turn sin before thy face, if
thou wilt that God thence turn away His face; and then safely thou
askest, and He heareth.

<span id="ii.LI-p69"></span>15. “A clean heart create in me, O God”
([Psa. 51.10](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#010.md)<span
id="ii.LI-p69.1"></span>). “Create”—he meant <span
id="fr_1854"></span>[1855](#fn_1854.md) to say, “as it were *begin*
something new.” But, because repentant he was praying (that had
committed some sin, which before he had committed, he was more
innocent), after what manner he hath said “create” he showeth. “And a
right spirit renew in my inner parts.” By my doing, he saith, the
uprightness of my spirit hath been made old and bowed. For he saith in
another Psalm, “They have bowed my soul.” <span
id="fr_1855"></span>[1856](#fn_1855.md) And when a man doth make himself
stoop unto earthly lusts, he is “bowed” in a manner, but when he is made
erect for things above, upright is his heart made, in order that God may
be good to him. For, “How good is the God of Israel to the upright of
heart!” <span id="fr_1856"></span>[1857](#fn_1856.md) Moreover, brethren,
listen. Sometimes God in this world chastiseth for his sin him that He
pardoneth in the world to come. For even to David himself, to whom it
had been already said by the Prophet, <span id="page_195">p. 195</span>
<span id="ii.LI-Page_195"></span>“Thy sin is put away,” <span
id="fr_1857"></span>[1858](#fn_1857.md) there happened certain things which
God had threatened for that very sin. <span
id="fr_1858"></span>[1859](#fn_1858.md) For his son Abessalom against him
waged bloody war, and many ways humbled his father. <span
id="fr_1859"></span>[1860](#fn_1859.md) He was walking in grief, in the
tribulation of his humiliation, so resigned to God, that, ascribing to
Him all that was just, he confessed that he was suffering nothing
undeservedly, having now an heart upright, to which God was not
displeasing. A slanderous person and one throwing in his teeth harsh
curses <span id="fr_1860"></span>[1861](#fn_1860.md) he patiently heard,
one of the soldiers on the opposite side, that were with his unnatural
son. And when he was heaping curses upon the king, one of the companions
of David, enraged, would have gone and smitten him; but he is kept back
by David. And he is kept back how? For that he said, God sent him to
curse me. Acknowledging his guilt he embraced his penance, seeking glory
not his own, praising the Lord in that good which he had, praising the
Lord in that which he was suffering, “blessing the Lord alway, ever His
praise was in his mouth.” <span id="fr_1861"></span>[1862](#fn_1861.md)
Such are all the upright in heart: not those crooked persons who think
themselves upright and God crooked: who when they do any evil thing,
rejoice; when they suffer any evil thing, blaspheme; nay, if set in
tribulation and scourging, they say from their distorted heart, “O God,
what have I done to Thee?” Truly it is because they have done nothing to
God, for they have done all to themselves. “And an upright spirit, renew
in my inner parts.”

<span id="ii.LI-p78"></span>16. “Cast me not forth from Thy face” ([Psa.
51.11](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#011)<span id="ii.LI-p78.1"></span>.md).
Turn away Thy face from my sins: and “cast me not forth from Thy face.”
Whose face he feareth, upon the face of the Same he calleth. “And Thy
Holy Spirit take not away from me.” For in one confessing there is the
Holy Spirit. Even now, to the gift of the Holy Spirit it belongeth, that
what thou hast done displeaseth thee. The unclean spirit sins do please;
the Holy One they displease. Though then thou still implore pardon, yet
thou art joined to God on the other part, because the evil thing that
thou hast committed displeaseth thee: for the same thing displeaseth
both thee and Him. Now, to assail thy fever, ye are two, thou and the
Physician. For the reason that there cannot be confession of sin and
punishment of sin in a man of himself: when one is angry with himself,
and is displeasing to himself, then it is not without the gift of the
Holy Spirit, nor doth he say, Thy Holy Spirit give to me, but, “Take not
away from me.”

<span id="ii.LI-p79"></span>17. “Give back to me the exultation of Thy
salvation” <span id="fr_1862"></span>[1863](#fn_1862.md) ([Psa.
51.12](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#012)<span id="ii.LI-p80.1"></span>.md).
“Give back” what I had; what by sinning I had lost: to wit, of Thy
Christ. For who without Him can be made whole? Because even before that
He was Son of Mary, “In the beginning He was the Word, and the Word was
with God, and the Word was God;” <span
id="fr_1863"></span>[1864](#fn_1863.md) and so, by the holy fathers a
future dispensation of flesh taken upon Him, was looked for; <span
id="fr_1864"></span>[1865](#fn_1864.md) as is believed by us to have been
done. Times are changed, not faith. “And with Principal Spirit confirm
me.” Some have here understood the Trinity in God, Itself God; the
dispensation of Flesh being excepted therefrom: since it is written,
“God is a Spirit.” <span id="fr_1865"></span>[1866](#fn_1865.md) For that
which is not body, and yet is, seemeth to exist in such sort as that it
is spirit. Therefore some understand here the Trinity spoken of: “In
upright Spirit,” the Son; in “Holy Spirit,” Holy Ghost; in “Principal
Spirit,” Father. <span id="fr_1866"></span>[1867](#fn_1866.md) It is not
any heretical opinion, therefore, whether this be so, or whether
“upright Spirit” He would have to be taken of man himself (when He
saith, “An upright spirit renew in my inner parts”), which I have bowed
and distorted by sinning, so that in that case the Holy Spirit be
Himself the Principal Spirit: which also he would not have to be taken
away from him, and thereby would have himself to be confirmed therein.

<span id="ii.LI-p85"></span>18. But see what he annexeth: “With
Principal Spirit,” he saith, “confirm Thou me.” Wherein “confirm”?
Because Thou hast pardoned me, because I am secure, that what Thou hast
forgiven is not to be ascribed, on this being made secure and with this
grace confirmed, therefore I am not ungrateful. But I shall do what? “I
would teach unrighteous men Thy ways” ([Psa.
51.13](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#013)<span id="ii.LI-p85.1"></span>.md).
Being *myself* of the unrighteous <span
id="fr_1867"></span>[1868](#fn_1867.md) (that is, one that was myself an
unrighteous man, now no longer unrighteous; the Holy Spirit not having
been taken away from me, and I being confirmed with Principal Spirit).
“I would teach unrighteous men Thy ways.” What ways wilt thou teach
unrighteous men? “And ungodly men to Thee shall be converted.” If
David’s sin is counted for ungodliness, let not ungodly men despair of
themselves, forasmuch as God hath spared an ungodly man; but let them
take heed that to Him they be converted, that His ways they learn. But
if David’s deed is not counted for ungodliness, but this is properly
call ungodliness, namely, to apostatize from God, not to worship one
God, or never to have worshipped, or to have forsaken, Him whom one did
worship, then what he saith hath the force of superabundance, “And
ungodly men shall to Thee be converted.” So full art thou of the fatness
of mercy, that for those converted to Thee, not only sinners of any
<span id="page_196">p. 196</span> <span id="ii.LI-Page_196"></span>sort,
but even ungodly, there is no cause for despair. Wherefore? That
believing on Him that justifieth an ungodly man, their faith may be
counted for righteousness. <span id="fr_1868"></span>[1869](#fn_1868.md)

<span id="ii.LI-p88"></span>19. “Deliver me from bloods, O God, God of
my health” ([Psa. 51.14](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#014.md)<span
id="ii.LI-p88.1"></span>). The Latin translator hath expressed, though
by a word not Latin, yet an accuracy from the Greek. <span
id="fr_1869"></span>[1870](#fn_1869.md) For we all know that in Latin,
*sanguines* (bloods) are not spoken of, nor yet *sanguina* (bloods in
the neuter), nevertheless because the Greek translator hath thus used
the plural number, not without reason, but because he found this in the
original language the Hebrew, a godly translator hath preferred to use a
word not Latin, rather than one not exact. Wherefore then hath he said
in the plural number, “From bloods”? In many bloods, as in the origin of
the sinful flesh, many sins he would have to be understood. The Apostle
having regard to the very sins which come of the corruption of flesh and
blood, saith, “Flesh and blood shall not possess the kingdom of
God.” <span id="fr_1870"></span>[1871](#fn_1870.md) For doubtless, after
the true faith of the same Apostle, that flesh shall rise again and
shall itself gain incorruption, as He saith Himself, “This corruptible
must put on incorruption, and this mortal put on immortality.” <span
id="fr_1871"></span>[1872](#fn_1871.md) Because then this corruption is of
sin, by the name thereof sins are called. In like manner as both that
morsel of flesh and member which playeth in the mouth when we articulate
words is called a tongue, and that is called a tongue which by the
tongue is made, so we call one tongue the Greek, another the Latin; for
the flesh is not diverse, but the sound. In the same manner, then, as
the speech which is made by the tongue is called a tongue; so also the
iniquity which is made by blood is called blood. Heeding, then, his many
iniquities, as <span id="fr_1872"></span>[1873](#fn_1872.md) in the
expression above, <span id="fr_1873"></span>[1874](#fn_1873.md) “And all my
iniquities blot out,” and ascribing them to the corruption of flesh and
blood, “Free me,” he saith, “from bloods:” that is, free me from
iniquities, cleanse me from all corruption.…Not yet is the substance,
but certain hope. “And my tongue shall exult of Thy righteousness.”

<span id="ii.LI-p94"></span>20. “O Lord, my lips Thou shalt open, and my
mouth shall tell of Thy praise” ([Psa.
51.15](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#015)<span id="ii.LI-p94.1"></span>.md).
“Thy praise,” because <span id="fr_1874"></span>[1875](#fn_1874.md) I have
been created: “Thy praise,” because sinning I have not been forsaken:
“Thy praise,” because I have been admonished to confess: “Thy praise,”
because in order that I might be secured I have been cleansed.

<span id="ii.LI-p96"></span>21. “Because if Thou hadst willed sacrifice,
I would have given it surely” ([Psa.
51.16](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#016)<span id="ii.LI-p96.1"></span>.md).
David was living at that time when sacrifices of victim animals were
offered to God, and he saw these times that were to be. Do we not
perceive ourselves in these words? Those sacrifices were figurative,
foretelling the One Saving Sacrifice. Not even we have been left without
a Sacrifice to offer to God. For hear what he saith, having a concern
for his sin, and wishing the evil thing which he hath done to be
forgiven him: “If Thou hadst willed,” he saith, “sacrifice, I would have
given it surely. With holocausts Thou wilt not be delighted.” Nothing
shall we therefore offer? So shall we come to God? And whence shall we
propitiate Him? Offer; certainly in thyself thou hast what thou mayest
offer. Do not from without fetch frankincense, <span
id="fr_1875"></span>[1876](#fn_1875.md) but say, “In me are, O God, Thy
vows, which I will render of praise to Thee.” <span
id="fr_1876"></span>[1877](#fn_1876.md) Do not from without seek cattle to
slay, thou hast in thyself what thou mayest kill. “Sacrifice to God is a
spirit troubled, a heart contrite and humbled God despiseth not” ([Psa.
51.17](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#017)<span id="ii.LI-p98.2"></span>.md).
Utterly he despiseth bull, he-goat, ram: now is not the time that these
should be offered. They were offered when they indicated something, when
they promised something; when the things promised come, the promises are
taken away. “A heart contrite and humbled God despiseth not.” Ye know
that God is high: if thou shalt have made thyself high, He will be from
thee; if thou shalt have humbled thyself, He will draw near to thee.

<span id="ii.LI-p99"></span>22. See who this is: David as one man was
seeming to implore; see ye here our image and the type of the Church.

<span id="ii.LI-p100"></span>“Deal kindly, O Lord, in Thy good will with
Sion” ([Psa. 51.18](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#018.md)<span
id="ii.LI-p100.1"></span>). With this Sion deal kindly. What is Sion? A
city holy. What is a city holy? That which cannot be hidden, being upon
a mountain established. Sion in prospect, because it hath prospect of
something which it hopeth for. For Sion is interpreted “prospect,” and
Jerusalem, “vision of peace.” Ye perceive then yourselves to be in Sion
and in Jerusalem, if being sure ye look for hope that is to be, and if
ye have peace with God. “And be the walls of Jerusalem builded.” “Deal
kindly, O Lord, in Thy good will with Sion, and be the walls of
Jerusalem builded.” For not to herself let Sion ascribe her merits: do
Thou with her deal kindly, “Be the walls of Jerusalem builded:” be the
battlements of our immortality laid, in faith and hope and charity.

<span id="ii.LI-p101"></span>23. “Then Thou shalt accept the sacrifice
of righteousness” ([Psa. 51.19](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#019.md)<span
id="ii.LI-p101.1"></span>). But now sacrifice for iniquity, to wit, a
spirit troubled, and a heart humbled; then the sacrifice of
righteousness, praises alone. For, “Blessed they that dwell in Thy
house, for ever and ever they shall praise Thee:” <span
id="fr_1877"></span>[1878](#fn_1877.md) for this is the sacrifice of
righteousness. <span id="page_197">p. 197</span> <span
id="ii.LI-Page_197"></span>“Oblations and holocausts.” What are
“holocausts”? A whole victim by fire consumed. When a whole beast was
laid upon the altar with fire to be consumed, it was called a holocaust.
May divine fire take us up whole, and that fervour catch us whole. What
fervour? “Neither is there that hideth himself from the heat
thereof.” <span id="fr_1878"></span>[1879](#fn_1878.md) What fervour? That
whereof speaketh the Apostle: “In spirit fervent.” <span
id="fr_1879"></span>[1880](#fn_1879.md) Be not merely our soul taken up by
that divine fire of wisdom, but also our body; that <span
id="fr_1880"></span>[1881](#fn_1880.md) it may earn their immortality; so
be it lifted up for a holocaust, that death be swallowed into victory.
“Oblations and holocausts.” “Then shall they lay upon thine altar
calves.” Whence “calves”? What shall He therein choose? Will it be the
innocence of the new age, or necks freed from the yoke of the law?…
