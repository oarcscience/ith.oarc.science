<span id="ii.LXXIX-p1"></span> <span id="ii.LXXIX-p1.1"></span><span
class="c20"><span id="ii.LXXIX-p1.2"></span>Psalm LXXIX. <span
id="fr_3666"></span>[3667](#fn_3666.md) </span>

<span id="ii.LXXIX-p3"></span>1. Over the title of this Psalm, being so
short and so simple, I think we need not tarry. But the prophecy which
here we read sent before, we know to be evidently fulfilled. For when
these things were being sung in the times of King David, nothing of such
sort, by the hostility of the Gentiles, as yet had befallen the city
Jerusalem, nor the Temple of God, which as yet was not even builded. For
that after the death of David his son Salomon made a temple to God, who
is ignorant? That is spoken of therefore as though past, which in the
Spirit was seen to be future.

<span id="ii.LXXIX-p4"></span>“O God, the Gentiles have come into Thine
inheritance” ([Psa. 79.1](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#001.md)<span
id="ii.LXXIX-p4.1"></span>). Under which form of expression other things
which were to come to pass, are spoken of as having been done. Nor must
this be wondered at, that these words are being spoken to God. For they
are not being represented to Him not knowing, by whose revelation they
are foreknown; but the soul is speaking with God with that affection of
godliness, of which God knoweth. <span
id="fr_3667"></span>[3668](#fn_3667.md) For even the things which Angels
proclaim to men, they proclaim to them that know them not; but the
things which they proclaim to God, they proclaim to Him knowing, when
they offer our prayers, and in ineffable manner consult the eternal
Truth respecting their actions, as an immutable law. And therefore this
man of God is saying to God that which he is to learn of God, like a
scholar to a master, not ignorant but judging; and so either approving
what he hath taught, or censuring what he hath not taught: especially
because under the appearance of one praying, the Prophet is transforming
into himself those who should be at the time when these things were to
come to pass. <span id="fr_3668"></span>[3669](#fn_3668.md) But in praying
it is customary to declare those things to God which He hath done in
taking vengeance, and for a petition to be added, that henceforth He
should pity and spare. In this way here also by him the judgments are
spoken of by whom they are foretold, as if they were being spoken of by
those whom they befell, and the very lamentation and prayer is a
prophecy.

<span id="ii.LXXIX-p7"></span>2. “They have defiled Thy holy Temple,
they have made Jerusalem for a keeping of apples.” “They have made the
dead bodies of Thy servants morsels for the fowls of heaven, the fleshes
of Thy saints for the beasts of the earth” ([Psa.
79.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#002)<span id="ii.LXXIX-p7.1"></span>.md).
“They have poured forth their blood like water in the circuit of
Jerusalem, and there was no one to bury them” ([Psa.
79.3](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#003)<span id="ii.LXXIX-p7.2"></span>.md).
If in this prophecy any one of us shall have thought that there must be
understood that laying waste of Jerusalem, which was made by Titus the
Roman Emperor, when already the Lord Jesus Christ, after His
Resurrection and <span id="page_381">p. 381</span> <span
id="ii.LXXIX-Page_381"></span>Ascension, was being preached among the
Gentiles, it doth not occur to me how that people could now have been
called the inheritance of God, as not holding to Christ, whom having
rejected and slain, that people became reprobate, which not even after
His Resurrection would believe in Him, and even killed His Martyrs. For
out of that people Israel whosoever have believed in Christ; to whom the
offer of Christ was made, and in a manner the healthful and fruitful
fulfilment of the promise; concerning whom even the Lord Himself saith,
“I am not sent but to the sheep which have been lost of the house of
Israel,” <span id="fr_3669"></span>[3670](#fn_3669.md) the same are they
that out of them are the sons of promise; the same are counted for a
seed; <span id="fr_3670"></span>[3671](#fn_3670.md) the same do belong to
the inheritance of God. From hence are Joseph that just man, and the
Virgin Mary who bore Christ: <span id="fr_3671"></span>[3672](#fn_3671.md)
hence John Baptist the friend of the Bridegroom, and his parents
Zacharias and Elisabeth: <span id="fr_3672"></span>[3673](#fn_3672.md)
hence Symeon the old, <span id="fr_3673"></span>[3674](#fn_3673.md) and
Anna the widow, who heard not Christ speaking by the sense of the body;
but while yet an infant not speaking, by the Spirit perceived Him: hence
the blessed Apostles: hence Nathanael, in whom guile was not: <span
id="fr_3674"></span>[3675](#fn_3674.md) hence the other Joseph, who himself
too looked for the kingdom of God: <span
id="fr_3675"></span>[3676](#fn_3675.md) hence that so great multitude who
went before and followed after His beast, saying, “Blessed is He that
cometh in the name of the Lord:” <span
id="fr_3676"></span>[3677](#fn_3676.md) among whom was also that company of
children, in whom He declared to have been fulfilled, “Out of the mouth
of infants and sucklings Thou hast perfected praise.” <span
id="fr_3677"></span>[3678](#fn_3677.md) Hence also were those after His
resurrection, of whom on one day three and on another five thousand were
baptized, <span id="fr_3678"></span>[3679](#fn_3678.md) welded into one
soul and one heart by the fire of love; of whom no one spoke of anything
as his own, but to them all things were common. <span
id="fr_3679"></span>[3680](#fn_3679.md) Hence the holy deacons, of whom
Stephen was crowned with martyrdom before the Apostles. <span
id="fr_3680"></span>[3681](#fn_3680.md) Hence so many Churches of Judæa,
which were in Christ, unto whom Paul was unknown by face, <span
id="fr_3681"></span>[3682](#fn_3681.md) but known for an infamous ferocity,
and more known for Christ’s most merciful grace. Hence even he,
according to the prophecy sent before concerning him, “a wolf ravening,
in the morning carrying off, and in the evening dividing morsels;” <span
id="fr_3682"></span>[3683](#fn_3682.md) that is, first as persecutor
carrying off unto death, afterwards as a preacher feeding unto life.
These are they that are out of that people the inheritance of God.…So
then even at this time a remnant through election of Grace have been
saved. This remnant out of that nation doth belong to the
inheritance <span id="fr_3683"></span>[3684](#fn_3683.md) of God: not those
concerning whom a little below he saith, “But the rest have been
blinded.” For thus he saith. “What then? That which Israel sought, this
he hath not obtained: but the election hath obtained it: but the rest
have been blinded.” <span id="fr_3684"></span>[3685](#fn_3684.md) This
election then, this remnant, that people of God, which God hath not cast
off, is called His inheritance. But in that Israel, which hath not
obtained this, in the rest that were blinded, there was no longer an
inheritance of God, in reference to whom it is possible that there
should be spoken, after the glorification of Christ in the Heavens, in
the time of Titus the Emperor, “O God, there have come the Gentiles unto
Thine inheritance,” and the other things which in this Psalm seem to
have been foretold concerning the destruction of both the temple and
city belonging to that people.

<span id="ii.LXXIX-p24"></span>3. Furthermore herein we ought either to
perceive those things which were done by other enemies, before Christ
had come in the flesh: at that time when there were even the holy
prophets, when the carrying away into Babylon took place, <span
id="fr_3685"></span>[3686](#fn_3685.md) and that nation was grievously
afflicted, and at the time when under Antiochus also the Maccabees,
having endured horrible sufferings, were most gloriously crowned. <span
id="fr_3686"></span>[3687](#fn_3686.md) Or certainly if after the
Resurrection and Ascension of the Lord the inheritance of God must be
understood to be here spoken of; such things must be understood herein,
as at the hands of worshippers of idols, and enemies of the name of
Christ, His Church, in such a multitude of martyrs, endured.…This Church
then, this inheritance of God, out of circumcision and uncircumcision
hath been congregated, that is, out of the people of Israel, and out of
the rest of the nations, by means of the Stone which the builders
rejected, and which hath become for the Head of the corner, <span
id="fr_3687"></span>[3688](#fn_3687.md) in which corner as it were two
walls coming from different quarters were united. “For Himself is our
peace, who hath made both one, that He might build two into Himself,
making peace, and might unite together <span
id="fr_3688"></span>[3689](#fn_3688.md) both in one Body unto God: <span
id="fr_3689"></span>[3690](#fn_3689.md) in which Body we are sons of God,
“crying, Abba Father.” <span id="fr_3690"></span>[3691](#fn_3690.md) Abba,
on account of their language; Father, on account of ours. For Abba is
the same as Father.…

<span id="ii.LXXIX-p31"></span>4. But now in that which followeth, “they
have made Jerusalem for a keeping of apples;” even the Church herself is
rightly understood under this name, even the free Jerusalem our
mother, <span id="fr_3691"></span>[3692](#fn_3691.md) concerning whom hath
been written, “many more are the sons of the forsaken, than <span
id="page_382">p. 382</span> <span id="ii.LXXIX-Page_382"></span>of her
that hath the husband.” <span id="fr_3692"></span>[3693](#fn_3692.md) The
expression, “for a keeping of apples,” I think must be understood of the
desertion which the wasting of persecution hath effected: that is, like
a keeping of apples; for the keeping of apples is abandoned, when the
apples have passed away. And certes when through the persecuting
Gentiles the Church seemed to be forsaken, unto the celestial table,
like as it were many and exceeding sweet apples from the garden of the
Lord, the spirits of the martyrs did pass away.

<span id="ii.LXXIX-p34"></span>5. “They have made,” he saith, “the dead
bodies of Thy servants morsels for the fowls of heaven, the fleshes of
Thy saints for the beasts of the earth” ([Psa.
79.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#002.md)<span
id="ii.LXXIX-p34.1"></span>). The expression, “dead bodies,” hath been
repeated in “fleshes:” and the expression, “of Thy servants,” hath been
repeated in, “of Thy saints.” This only hath been varied, “to the fowls
of heaven, and to the beasts of the earth.” Better have they interpreted
who have written “dead,” than as some have it, “mortal.” For “dead” is
only said of those that have died; but mortal is a term applied even to
living bodies. When then, as I have said, to their Husbandman the
spirits of martyrs like apples had passed away, their dead bodies and
their fleshes they set before the fowls of heaven and the beasts of the
earth: as if any part of them could be lost to the resurrection, whereas
out of the hidden recesses of the natural world He will renew the whole,
by whom even our hairs have been numbered. <span
id="fr_3693"></span>[3694](#fn_3693.md)

<span id="ii.LXXIX-p36"></span>6. “They have poured forth their blood
like water,” that is, abundantly and wantonly, “in the circuit of
Jerusalem” ([Psa. 79.3](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#003.md)<span
id="ii.LXXIX-p36.1"></span>). If we herein understand the earthly city
Jerusalem, we perceive the shedding of their blood in the circuit
thereof, whom the enemy could find outside the walls. But if we
understand it of that Jerusalem, concerning whom hath been said, “many
more are the sons of her that was forsaken, than of her that hath the
husband,” <span id="fr_3694"></span>[3695](#fn_3694.md) the circuit thereof
is throughout the universal earth. For in that lesson of the Prophet,
wherein is written, “many more are the sons of her that was forsaken,
than of her that hath the husband:” a little after unto the same is
said, “and He that hath delivered thee, shall be called the God of
Israel of the universal earth.” <span
id="fr_3695"></span>[3696](#fn_3695.md) The circuit then of this Jerusalem
in this Psalm must be understood as followeth: so far as at that time
the Church had been expanded, bearing fruit, and growing in the
universal world, when in every part thereof persecution was raging, and
was making havoc of the Martyrs, whose blood was being shed like water,
to the great gain of the celestial treasuries. But as to that which hath
been added, “and there was no one to bury:” it either ought not to seem
to be an incredible thing that there should have been so great a panic
in some places, that not any buriers at all of holy bodies came forward:
or certes that unburied corpses in many places might lie long time,
until being by the religious in a manner stolen <span
id="fr_3696"></span>[3697](#fn_3696.md) they were buried.

<span id="ii.LXXIX-p40"></span>7. “We have become,” he saith, “a
reproach to our neighbours” ([Psa.
79.4](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#004.md)<span
id="ii.LXXIX-p40.1"></span>). Therefore precious not in the sight of
men, from whom this reproach was, but “precious <span
id="fr_3697"></span>[3698](#fn_3697.md) in the sight of the Lord is the
death of His saints.” <span id="fr_3698"></span>[3699](#fn_3698.md) “A
scoffing and derision:” or, as some have interpreted it, “a mockery to
them that are in our circuit.” It is a repetition of the former
sentence. For that which above hath been called, “a reproach,” the same
hath been repeated in, “a scoffing and derision:” and that which above
hath been said in, “to our neighbours,” the same hath been repeated in,
“to them that are in our circuit.” Moreover, in reference to the earthly
Jerusalem, the neighbours, and those in the circuit of that nation, are
certainly understood to be other nations. But in reference to the free
Jerusalem our mother, <span id="fr_3699"></span>[3700](#fn_3699.md) there
are neighbours even in the circuit of her, among whom, being her
enemies, the Church dwelleth in the circuit of the round world.

<span id="ii.LXXIX-p44"></span>8. In the second place now giving
utterance to an evident prayer, whence it may be perceived that the
calling to remembrance of former affliction is not by way of information
but prayer; “How long,” he saith, “O Lord, wilt Thou be angry, unto the
end? shall Thy jealousy burn like fire?” ([Psa.
79.5](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#005.md)<span
id="ii.LXXIX-p44.1"></span>). He is evidently asking God not to be angry
unto the end, that is, that this so great oppression and tribulation and
devastation may not continue even unto the end; but that He moderate His
chastening, according to that which is said in another Psalm, “Thou
shalt feed us with the bread of tears, and Thou shalt give us to drink
of tears in measure.” <span id="fr_3700"></span>[3701](#fn_3700.md) For
the, “how long, O Lord, wilt Thou be angry, unto the end?” hath been
spoken in the same sense as if it had been said, Be not, O Lord, angry
unto the end. And in that which followeth, “shall Thy jealousy burn like
fire?” both words must be understood, both, “how long,” and, “unto the
end:” just as if there had been said, how long shall there burn like
fire Thy jealousy unto the end? For these two words must be understood
in the same manner as that word which was used a little higher up,
namely, “they have made.” For while the former sentence hath, “they have
made the dead bodies of Thy servants morsels for the fowls of
heaven:” <span id="fr_3701"></span>[3702](#fn_3701.md) this <span
id="page_383">p. 383</span> <span id="ii.LXXIX-Page_383"></span>word the
latter sentence hath not, wherein is said, “the fleshes of Thy saints
for the beasts of the earth;” but there is surely understood what the
former hath, namely, “they have made.”

<span id="ii.LXXIX-p47"></span>Moreover, the anger and jealousy of
God <span id="fr_3702"></span>[3703](#fn_3702.md) are not emotions of God;
as some do charge upon the Scriptures which they do not
understand: <span id="fr_3703"></span>[3704](#fn_3703.md) but under the
name of anger is to be understood the avenging of iniquity; under the
name of jealousy, the exaction of chastity; that the soul may not
despise the law of her Lord, and perish by departing in fornication from
the Lord. These then in their actual operation in men’s affliction are
violent; but in the disposal of God they are calm, unto whom hath been
said, “But Thou, O Lord of virtues, with calmness dost judge.” <span
id="fr_3704"></span>[3705](#fn_3704.md) But it is clearly enough shown by
these words, that for sins these tribulations do befall men, though they
be faithful: although hence may bloom the Martyrs’ glory by occasion of
their patience, and the yoke of discipline godly endured as the scourge
of the Lord. Of this the Maccabees amid sharp tortures, <span
id="fr_3705"></span>[3706](#fn_3705.md) of this the three men amid flames
innocuous, <span id="fr_3706"></span>[3707](#fn_3706.md) of this the holy
Prophets in captivity, do testify. For although paternal correction most
bravely and most godly they endure, yet they do not hide the fact, that
these things have befallen them for the deservings of their sins. <span
id="fr_3707"></span>[3708](#fn_3707.md) …

<span id="ii.LXXIX-p54"></span>9. But that which he addeth, “Pour forth
Thine anger upon the nations which have not known Thee, and upon the
kingdoms which have not called upon Thy name” ([Psa.
79.6](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#006.md)<span
id="ii.LXXIX-p54.1"></span>); this too is a prophecy, not a wish. Not in
the imprecation of malevolence are these words spoken, but foreseen by
the Spirit they are predicted: just as in the case of Judas the traitor,
the evil things which were to befall him have been so prophesied as if
they were wished. For in like manner as the prophet doth not command
Christ, though in the imperative mood he giveth utterance to what he
saith, “Gird Thou Thy sword about Thy thigh, O Most Mighty: in Thy
beauty and in Thy goodliness, both go on, and prosperously proceed, and
reign:” <span id="fr_3708"></span>[3709](#fn_3708.md) so he doth not wish,
but doth prophesy, who saith, “Pour forth Thine anger upon the nations
which have not known Thee.” Which in his usual way he repeateth, saying,
“And upon the kingdoms which have not called upon Thy name.” For nations
have been repeated in kingdoms: and that they have not known Him, hath
been repeated in this, that they have not called upon His name. How then
must be understood, what the Lord saith in the Gospel  <span
id="fr_3709"></span>[3710](#fn_3709.md) concerning stripes, “the many and
the few”? if greater the anger of God is against the nations, which have
not known the Lord? For in this which he saith, “Pour forth Thine
anger,” with this word he hath clearly enough pointed out, how great
anger he hath willed that there should be understood. Whence afterwards
he saith, “Render to our neighbours seven times as much.” <span
id="fr_3710"></span>[3711](#fn_3710.md) Is it not that there is a great
difference between servants, who, though they know not the will of their
Lord, do yet call upon His name, and those that are aliens from the
family of so great a Master, who are so ignorant of God, as that they do
not even call upon God? For in place of Him they call upon either idols
or demons, or any creature they choose; not the Creator, who is blessed
for ever. For those persons, concerning whom he is prophesying this, he
doth not even intimate to be so ignorant of the will of their God, as
that still they fear the Lord Himself; but so ignorant of the Lord
Himself, that they do not even call upon Him, and that they stand forth
as enemies of His name. There is a great difference then between
servants not knowing the will of their God, and yet living in His family
and in His house, and enemies not only setting the will against knowing
the Lord Himself, but also not calling upon His name, and even in His
servants fighting against it.

<span id="ii.LXXIX-p58"></span>10. Lastly, there followeth, “For they
have eaten up Jacob, and his place they have made desolate” ([Psa.
79.7](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#007.md)<span
id="ii.LXXIX-p58.1"></span>).…How we should view “the place” of Jacob,
must be understood. For rather the place of Jacob may be supposed to be
that city, wherein was also the Temple, whither-unto the whole of that
nation for the purpose of sacrifice and worship, and to celebrate the
Passover, the Lord had commanded to assemble. For if the assemblies of
Christians, letted and suppressed by persecutors, has been what the
Prophet would have to be understood, it would seem that he should have
said, places made desolate, not place. Still we may take the singular
number as put for the plural number; as dress for clothes, soldiery for
soldiers, cattle for beasts: for many words are usually spoken in this
manner, and not only in the mouths of vulgar speakers, but even in the
eloquence of the most approved authorities. Nor to divine Scripture
herself is this form of speech foreign. For even she hath put frog for
frogs, locust for locusts, <span id="fr_3711"></span>[3712](#fn_3711.md)
and countless expressions of the like kind. But that which hath been
said, “They have eaten up Jacob,” the same is well understood, in that
many men into their own evil-minded body, that is, into their own
society, they have constrained to pass.

<span id="ii.LXXIX-p60"></span>11. …He subjoineth, “Remember not our
iniquities of old” ([Psa. 79.8](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#008.md)<span
id="ii.LXXIX-p60.1"></span>). He saith not by<span id="page_384">p.
384</span> <span id="ii.LXXIX-Page_384"></span>gone, which might have
even been recent; but “of old,” that is, coming from parents. For to
such iniquities judgment, not correction, is <span
id="fr_3712"></span>[3713](#fn_3712.md) owing. “Speedily let Thy mercies
anticipate us.” Anticipate, that is, at Thy judgment. For “mercy
exalteth above in judgment.” <span id="fr_3713"></span>[3714](#fn_3713.md)
Now there is “judgment without mercy,” but to him that hath not showed
mercy. But whereas he addeth, “for we have become exceeding poor:” unto
this end he willeth that the mercies of God should be understood to
anticipate us; that our own poverty, that is, weakness, by Him having
mercy, should be aided to do His commandments, that we may not come to
His judgment to be condemned.

<span id="ii.LXXIX-p63"></span>12. Therefore there followeth, “Help us,
O God, our healing <span id="fr_3714"></span>[3715](#fn_3714.md) One”
([Psa. 79.9](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#009.md)<span
id="ii.LXXIX-p64.1"></span>). By this word which he saith, “our healing
One,” he doth sufficiently explain what sort of poverty he hath willed
to be understood, in that which he had said, “for we have become
exceeding poor.” For it is that very sickness, to which a healer is
necessary. But while he would have us to be aided, he is neither
ungrateful to grace, nor doth he take away free-will. For he that is
aided, doth also of himself something. He hath added also, “for the
glory of Thy Name, O Lord, deliver us:” in order that he who glorieth,
not in himself, but in the Lord may glory. <span
id="fr_3715"></span>[3716](#fn_3715.md) “And merciful be Thou,” he saith,
“to our sins for Thy Name’s sake:” not for our sake. For what else do
our sins deserve, but due and condign punishments? But “merciful be Thou
to our sins, for Thy Name’s sake.” Thus then Thou dost deliver us, that
is, dost rescue us from evil things, while Thou dost both aid us to do
justice, and art merciful to our sins, without which in this life we are
not. For “in Thy sight shall no man living be justified.”  <span
id="fr_3716"></span>[3717](#fn_3716.md) But sin is iniquity. <span
id="fr_3717"></span>[3718](#fn_3717.md) And “if Thou shalt have marked
iniquities, who shall stand?” <span id="fr_3718"></span>[3719](#fn_3718.md)

<span id="ii.LXXIX-p69"></span>13. But that which he addeth, “lest at
any time they should say among the Gentiles, Where is their God?” ([Psa.
79.10](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#010.md)<span
id="ii.LXXIX-p69.1"></span>) must be taken as rather for the Gentiles
themselves. For to a bad end they come that have despaired of the true
God, thinking that either He is not, or doth not help His own, and is
not merciful to them. But this which followeth, “and that there may be
known among the nations before our eyes the vengeance of the blood of
Thy servants which hath been shed:” is either to be understood as of the
time, when they believe in the true God that used to persecute His
inheritance; because even that is vengeance, whereby is slain the fierce
iniquity of them by the sword of the Word of God, concerning which hath
been said, “Gird Thou Thy sword:” <span
id="fr_3719"></span>[3720](#fn_3719.md) or when obstinate enemies at the
last are punished. For the corporal ills which they suffer in this
world, they may have in common with good men. There is also another kind
of vengeance; that wherein the Church’s enlargement and fruitfulness in
this world after so great persecutions, wherein they supposed she would
utterly perish, the sinner and unbeliever and enemy seeth, and is angry;
“with his teeth he shall gnash, and shall pine away.”  <span
id="fr_3720"></span>[3721](#fn_3720.md) For who would dare to deny that
even this is a most heavy punishment? But I know not whether that which
he saith, “before our eyes,” is taken with sufficient elegance, if by
this sort of punishment we understand that which is done in the inmost
recesses of the heart, and doth torment even those who blandly smile at
us, while by us there cannot be seen what they suffer in the inner man.
But the fact, that whether in them believing their iniquity is slain, or
whether the last punishment is rendered to them persevering in their
naughtiness, without difficulty of doubtfulness is understood in the
saying, “that there may be known before our eyes vengeance among the
nations.”

<span id="ii.LXXIX-p72"></span>14. And this indeed, as we have said, is
a prophecy, not a wish.…And the Lord in the Gospel <span
id="fr_3721"></span>[3722](#fn_3721.md) hath set before us the widow for an
example, who longing to be avenged, did intercede with the unjust judge,
who at length heard her, not as being guided by justice, but overcome
with weariness: but this the Lord hath set before us, to show that much
more the just God will speedily make the judgment of His elect, who cry
unto Him day and night. Thence is also that cry of the Martyrs under the
altar of God, <span id="fr_3722"></span>[3723](#fn_3722.md) that they may
be avenged in the judgment of God. Where then is the, “Love your
enemies, do good unto them that hate you, and pray for them that
persecute you”? <span id="fr_3723"></span>[3724](#fn_3723.md) Where is also
the, “Not rendering evil for evil, nor cursing for cursing:” <span
id="fr_3724"></span>[3725](#fn_3724.md) and, “unto no man rendering evil
for evil”? <span id="fr_3725"></span>[3726](#fn_3725.md) …For when the Lord
was exhorting us to love enemies, He set before us the example of our
Father, who is in Heaven, “who maketh His sun to rise upon good men and
evil men, and raineth upon just men and unjust men:” <span
id="fr_3726"></span>[3727](#fn_3726.md) doth He yet therefore not chasten
even by temporal correction, or not condemn at the last the obstinately
hardened? Let therefore an enemy be so loved as that the Lord’s justice
whereby he is punished displease us not, and let the justice whereby he
is punished so please us, as that the joy is not at his evil but at the
good Judge. But a malevolent soul is sorrowful, if his enemy by being
corrected shall have escaped punishment: and <span id="page_385">p.
385</span> <span id="ii.LXXIX-Page_385"></span>when he seeth him
punished, he is so glad that he is avenged, that he is not delighted
with the justice of God, whom he loveth not, but with the misery of that
man whom he hateth: and when he leaveth judgment to God, he hopeth that
God will hurt more than he could hurt: and when he giveth food to his
hungering enemy, and drink to him thirsty, he hath an evil-minded sense
of that which is written, “For thus doing thou shalt heap coals of fire
upon his head.” <span id="fr_3727"></span>[3728](#fn_3727.md) …In such sort
then under the appearance of one asking in this Psalm, future vengeance
on the ungodly is prophesied of, as that we are to understand that holy
men of God have loved their enemies, and have wished no one anything but
good, which is godliness in this world, everlasting life in that to
come; but in the punishments of evil men, they have taken pleasure not
in the ills of them, but in God’s good judgments; and wheresoever in the
holy Scriptures we read of their hatreds against men, they were the
hatreds of vices, which every man must needs hate in himself, if he
loveth himself.

<span id="ii.LXXIX-p80"></span>15. But now in that which followeth, “Let
there come in before Thy sight,” or, as some copies have it, “In Thy
sight, the groans of the fettered:” not easily doth any one discover
that the Saints were thrown into fetters by persecutors; and if this
doth happen amid so great and manifold a variety of punishments, so
rarely it doth happen, that it must not be believed that the prophet had
chosen to allude to this especially in this verse. But, in fact, the
fetters are the infirmity and the corruptibleness of the body, which do
weigh down the soul. For by means of the frailty thereof, as a kind of
material for certain pains and troubles, the persecutor might constrain
her unto ungodliness. From these fetters the Apostle was longing to be
unbound, and to be with Christ; <span
id="fr_3728"></span>[3729](#fn_3728.md) but to abide in the flesh was
necessary for their sakes unto whom he was ministering the Gospel. Until
then this corruptible put on incorruption, and this mortal put on
immortality, <span id="fr_3729"></span>[3730](#fn_3729.md) like as it were
with fetters, the weak flesh doth let the willing spirit. <span
id="fr_3730"></span>[3731](#fn_3730.md) These fetters then not any do feel,
but they that in themselves do groan being burthened, desiring to be
clothed upon with the tabernacle which is from Heaven; <span
id="fr_3731"></span>[3732](#fn_3731.md) because both death is a terror, and
mortal life is sorrow. In behalf of these men groaning the Prophet doth
redouble his groaning, that their groaning may “come in in the sight of
the Lord.” They also may be understood to be fettered, who are enchained
with the precepts of wisdom, the which being patiently supported are
turned into ornaments: whence it hath been written, “Put thy feet into
her fetters.” <span id="fr_3732"></span>[3733](#fn_3732.md) “According to
the greatness,” he saith, “of Thy arm, receive Thou unto adoption the
sons of them that are put to death:” <span
id="fr_3733"></span>[3734](#fn_3733.md) or, as is read in some copies,
“Possess Thou sons by the death of the punished.” <span
id="fr_3734"></span>[3735](#fn_3734.md) Wherein the Scripture seemeth to me
to have sufficiently shown, what hath been the groan of the fettered,
who for the name of Christ endured most grievous persecutions, which in
this Psalm are most clearly prophesied. For being beset with divers
sufferings, they used to pray for the Church, that their blood might not
be without fruit to posterity; in order that the Lord’s harvest might
more abundantly flourish by the very means whereby enemies thought that
she would perish. For “sons of them that were put to death” he hath
called them who were not only not terrified by the sufferings of those
that went before, but in Him for whose name they knew them to have
suffered, being inflamed with their glory which did inspire them to the
like, in most ample hosts they believed. Therefore he hath said,
“According to the greatness of Thine arm.” For so great a wonder
followed in the case of Christian peoples, as they, who thought they
would prevail aught by persecuting her, no wise believed would follow.

<span id="ii.LXXIX-p88"></span>16. “Render,” he saith, “to our
neighbours seven times so much into their bosoms” ([Psa.
79.13](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#013.md)<span
id="ii.LXXIX-p88.1"></span>). Not any evil things he is wishing, but
things just he is foretelling and prophesying as to come. But in the
number seven, that is, in sevenfold retribution, he would have the
completeness of the punishment to be perceived, for with this number
fulness is wont to be signified. Whence also there is this saying for
the good, “He shall receive in this world seven times as much:” <span
id="fr_3735"></span>[3736](#fn_3735.md) which hath been put for all. “As if
having nothing, and possessing all things.” <span
id="fr_3736"></span>[3737](#fn_3736.md) Of neighbours he is speaking,
because amongst them dwelleth the Church even unto the day of severing:
for not now is made the corporal separation. “Into their bosoms,” he
saith, as being now in secret, so that the vengeance which is now being
executed in secret in this life, hereafter may be known among the
nations before our eyes. For when a man is given over to a reprobate
mind, in his inward bosom he is receiving what he deserveth of future
punishments. “Their reproach wherewith they have reproached Thee, O
Lord.” This do Thou render to them sevenfold into their bosoms, that is,
in return for this reproach, most fully do Thou rebuke them in their
secret places. For in this they have reproached Thy Name, thinking to
efface Thee from the earth in Thy servants.

<span id="ii.LXXIX-p91"></span><span id="page_386">p. 386</span> <span
id="ii.LXXIX-Page_386"></span>17. “But we Thy people” ([Psa.
79.14](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#014.md)<span
id="ii.LXXIX-p91.1"></span>), must be taken generally of all the race of
godly and true Christians. “We,” then, whom they thought they had power
to destroy, “Thy people, and the sheep of thy flock:” in order that he
that glorieth may glory in the Lord, <span
id="fr_3737"></span>[3738](#fn_3737.md) “will confess to Thee for an age.”
But some copies have it, “will confess to Thee for everlasting.” Out of
a Greek ambiguity this diversity hath arisen. For that which the Greek
hath, <span class="Greek"><span id="ii.LXXIX-p92.2"></span>εἰς τὸν
αἰῶνα</span>, may be interpreted both by “for everlasting,” and “for an
age;” but according to the context we must understand which is the
better interpretation. The sense then of this passage seemeth to me to
show, that we ought to say “for an age,” that is, even unto the end of
time. But the following verse after the manner of the Scriptures, and
especially of the Psalms, is a repetition of the former with the order
changed, putting that before which in the former case was after, and
that after which in the former case was before. For whereas in the
former case there had been said, “we will confess to Thee,” instead of
the same herein hath been said, “We will proclaim Thy praise.” And so
whereas in the former case there had been said, “for an age,” instead of
the same herein hath been said, “for generation and generation.” For
this repetition of generation doth signify perpetuity: or, as some
understand it, it is because there are two generations, an old and a
new.…But in many places of holy Scriptures we have already made known to
you that confession is also put for praise: as in this passage it is,
“These words ye shall say in confession, ‘That the works of the Lord are
very good.’”  <span id="fr_3738"></span>[3739](#fn_3738.md) And especially
that which the Saviour Himself saith, who had not any sin at all, which
by repentance to confess: “I confess to Thee, Father, Lord of heaven and
earth, that Thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and
hast revealed them to babes.” <span id="fr_3739"></span>[3740](#fn_3739.md)
I have said this, in order that it may be more clearly perceived how in
the expression, “We will proclaim Thy praise,” the same hath been
repeated as had been said higher up, “We will confess to Thee.”
