<span id="ii.CXIX.xiv"></span>

<span id="ii.CXIX.xiv-p1"></span> *<span class="c2"><span
id="ii.CXIX.xiv-p1.1"></span>Nun.</span>*

<span id="ii.CXIX.xiv-p2"></span>105. “Thy word is a lantern unto my
feet, and a light unto my paths” ([Psa.
119.105](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#105.md)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xiv-p2.1"></span>). The word “lantern” appears in the word
“light;” “my feet” are also repeated in “my paths.” What then meaneth
“Thy Word”? <span id="fr_5282"></span>[5283](#fn_5282.md) Is it He who was
in the beginning God with God, that is, the Word by whom all things were
made? It is not thus. For that Word is a light, but is not a lantern.
For a lantern is a creature, not a creator; and it is lighted by
participation of an unchangeable light.…For no creature, howsoever
rational and intellectual, is lighted by itself, but is lighted by
participation of eternal Truth: although sometimes day is spoken of, not
meaning the Lord, but that “day which the Lord hath made,” <span
id="fr_5283"></span>[5284](#fn_5283.md) and on account of which it is said,
“Come unto Him, and be lightened.” <span
id="fr_5284"></span>[5285](#fn_5284.md) On account of which participation,
inasmuch as the Mediator Himself became Man, He is styled lantern in the
Apocalypse. <span id="fr_5285"></span>[5286](#fn_5285.md) But this sense is
a solitary one; for it cannot be divinely spoken of any of the saints,
nor in any wise lawfully said of any, “The Word was made flesh,” <span
id="fr_5286"></span>[5287](#fn_5286.md) save of the “one Mediator between
God and men.” <span id="fr_5287"></span>[5288](#fn_5287.md) Since therefore
the only-begotten Word, coequal with the Father, is styled a light; and
man when enlightened by the Word is also called a light, who is styled
also a lantern, as John, as the Apostles; and since no man of these is
the Word, and that Word by whom they were enlightened is not a lan<span
id="page_578">p. 578</span> <span id="ii.CXIX.xiv-Page_578"></span>tern;
what is this word, which is thus called a light and a lantern at the
same time, save we understand the word which was sent unto the Prophets,
or which was preached through the Apostles; not Christ the Word, but the
word of Christ, of which it is written, “Faith cometh by hearing, and
hearing by the word of God”? <span id="fr_5288"></span>[5289](#fn_5288.md)
For the Apostle Peter also, comparing the prophetical word to a lantern,
saith, “whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a lantern, that
shineth in a dark place.” <span id="fr_5289"></span>[5290](#fn_5289.md)
What, therefore, he here saith, “Thy word” is the word which is
contained in all the holy Scriptures.

<span id="ii.CXIX.xiv-p11"></span>106. “I have sworn, and am stedfastly
purposed to keep Thy righteous judgments” ([Psa.
119.106](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#106.md)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xiv-p11.1"></span>): as one who walked aright in the light
of that lantern, and kept to straight paths. For he calleth what he hath
determined by a sacrament, an oath; because the mind ought to be so
fixed in keeping the righteous judgments of God, that its determination
should be in the place of an oath. Now the righteous judgments of God
are kept by faith; when, under the righteous judgment of God, neither
any good work is believed to be fruitless, nor any sin unpunished; but,
because the body of Christ hath suffered many most grievous evils for
this faith, he saith, “I was humbled above measure” ([Psa.
119.107](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#107.md)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xiv-p11.2"></span>). He doth not say, I have humbled myself,
so that we must needs understand that humiliation which is commanded;
but he saith, “I was humbled above-measure;” that is, suffered a very
heavy persecution, because he swore and was steadfastly purposed to keep
the righteous judgments of God. And, lest in such trouble faith herself
might faint he addeth, “Quicken me, O Lord, according to Thy word:” that
is, according to Thy promise. For the word of the promises of God is a
lantern to the feet, and a light to the paths. Thus also above, in the
humiliation of persecution, he prayed that God would quicken him. <span
id="fr_5290"></span>[5291](#fn_5290.md) …

<span id="ii.CXIX.xiv-p13"></span>107. “Make the freewill offerings of
my mouth well pleasing, O Lord” ([Psa.
119.108](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#108.md)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xiv-p13.1"></span>): that is, let them please Thee; do not
reject, but approve them. By the freewill offerings of the mouth are
well understood the sacrifices of praise, offered up in the confession
of love, not from the fear of necessity; whence it is said, “a freewill
offering will I offer Thee.” <span id="fr_5291"></span>[5292](#fn_5291.md)
But what doth he add? “and teach me Thy judgments”? Had he not himself
said above, “From Thy judgments I have not swerved”? How could he have
done thus, if he knew them not? Moreover, if he knew them, in what sense
doth he here say, “and teach me Thy judgments”? Is it as in a former
passage, “Thou hast dealt in sweetness with Thy servant:” presently
after which we find, “teach me sweetness”? This passage we explained as
the words of one who was gaining in grace, and praying that he might
receive in addition to what he had received.

<span id="ii.CXIX.xiv-p15"></span>108. “My soul is alway in Thy hand”
([Psa. 119.109](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#109.md)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xiv-p15.1"></span>). Some copies read, “in my hand:” but
most, “in Thy hand;” and this latter is indeed easy. For “the souls of
the righteous are in God’s hand: <span
id="fr_5292"></span>[5293](#fn_5292.md) in whose hand are both we and our
words.” <span id="fr_5293"></span>[5294](#fn_5293.md) “And I do not forget
Thy law:” as if his memory were aided to remember God’s law by the hands
of Him in whose hands is his soul. But how the words, “My soul is in my
hands,” can be understood, I know not. For these are the words of the
righteous, not of the ungodly; of one who is returning to the Father,
not departing from the Father. <span
id="fr_5294"></span>[5295](#fn_5294.md) …Is it perhaps said, “My soul is in
my hands,” in this sense, as if he offered it to God to be quickened?
Whence in another passage it is said, “Unto Thee, O Lord, have I lifted
up my soul.” <span id="fr_5295"></span>[5296](#fn_5295.md) Since here too
he had said above, “Quicken Thou me.”

<span id="ii.CXIX.xiv-p20"></span>109. “The ungodly,” he saith, “have
laid a snare for me: but yet I swerved not from Thy commandments” ([Psa.
119.110](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#110.md)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xiv-p20.1"></span>). Whence this, unless because his soul is
in the hands of God, or in his own hands is offered to God to be
quickened?

<span id="ii.CXIX.xiv-p21"></span>110. “Thy testimonies have I gained in
heritage for ever” ([Psa. 119.111](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#111.md)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xiv-p21.1"></span>). Some wishing to express in one word
what is put in one word in the Greek, have translated it *hereditavi.*
Which although it might be Latin, yet would rather signify one who gave
an inheritance than one who received it, *hereditavi* being like
*ditavi.* Better, therefore, the whole sense is conveyed in two words,
whether we say, “I have possessed in heritage,” or, “I have gotten in
heritage:” not gotten heritage, but “gotten in heritage.” If it be
asked, what he gained in heritage, he replieth, “Thy testimonies.” What
doth he wish to be understood, save that he might become a witness of
God, and confess His testimonies, that is, that he might become a Martyr
of God, and might declare His testimonies, as the Martyrs do, was a gift
bestowed upon him by the Father, of whom he is heir?…But even their wish
was prepared by the Lord. For this reason he saith he hath gained them
in heritage, and this “for ever;” because they have not in them the
temporal glory of men who seek vain things, but the eternal glory of
those who suffer for a short season, and who reign without end. Whence
the next words, “Because they are the very joy of my heart:” although
the affliction of the body, yet the very joy of the heart.

<span id="ii.CXIX.xiv-p22"></span>111. He then addeth: “I have applied
my heart to fulfil Thy righteousness for ever, for my <span
id="page_579">p. 579</span> <span
id="ii.CXIX.xiv-Page_579"></span>reward” ([Psa.
119.112](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#112.md)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xiv-p22.1"></span>). He who saith, “I have applied my
heart,” had before said, “Incline my heart unto Thy testimonies:” <span
id="fr_5296"></span>[5297](#fn_5296.md) so that we may understand that it
is at once a divine gift, and an act of free will. But are we to fulfil
the righteousnesses of God for ever? Those works which we perform in
regard to the need of our neighbours, cannot be everlasting, any more
than their need; but if we do not do them from love, there is no
righteousness; if we do them from love, that love is everlasting, and an
everlasting reward is in store for it.
