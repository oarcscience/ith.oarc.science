<span id="ii.CXIX.xxi-p1"></span> *<span class="c2"><span

<span id="ii.CXIX.xxi-p2"></span>159. We know what persecutions the body
of Christ, that is, the holy Church, suffered from the kings of the
earth. Let us therefore here also recognise the words of the Church:
“Princes have persecuted me without a cause: and my heart hath stood in
awe of Thee” ([Psa. 119.161](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#161)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xxi-p2.1"></span>). For how had the Christians injured the
kingdoms of the earth, although their King promised them the kingdom of
heaven? How, I ask, had they injured the kingdoms of earth? Did their
King forbid His soldiers to pay and to render due service to the kings
of the earth? Saith He not to the Jews who were striving to calumniate
Him, “Render unto Cæsar the things that are Cæsar’s, and unto God the
things that are God’s”? <span id="fr_5361"></span>[5362](#fn_5361) Did
He not even in His own Person pay tribute from the mouth of a
fish? <span id="fr_5362"></span>[5363](#fn_5362) Did not His forerunner,
when the soldiers of this kingdom were seeking what they ought to do for
their everlasting salvation, instead of replying, Loose your belts,
throw away your arms, desert your king, that ye may wage war for the
Lord, answer, “Do violence to no man: neither accuse any falsely: and be
content with your wages”? <span id="fr_5363"></span>[5364](#fn_5363) Did
not one of His soldiers, His most beloved companion, <span
id="fr_5364"></span>[5365](#fn_5364) say to his fellow soldiers, the
provincials, <span id="fr_5365"></span>[5366](#fn_5365) so to speak, of
Christ, “Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers”? <span
id="fr_5366"></span>[5367](#fn_5366) Does he not enjoin the Church to
pray for even kings themselves? <span
id="fr_5367"></span>[5368](#fn_5367) How then have the Christians
offended against them? What due have they not rendered? in what have not
Christians obeyed the monarchs of earth? The kings of the earth
therefore have persecuted the Christians without a cause. They too had
their threatening words: I banish, I proscribe, I slay, I torture with
claws, I burn with fires, I expose to beasts, I tear the limbs
piecemeal. <span id="fr_5368"></span>[5369](#fn_5368) But heed what he
hath subjoined: “And my heart hath stood in awe of Thy word.” My heart
hath stood in awe of these words, <span
id="fr_5369"></span>[5370](#fn_5369) “Fear not them that kill the body,”
etc. I have scorned man who persecuteth me, and have overcome the devil
that would seduce me.

<span id="ii.CXIX.xxi-p12"></span><span id="page_587">p. 587</span>
<span id="ii.CXIX.xxi-Page_587"></span>160. Then follows, “I am as glad
of Thy word as one that findeth great spoils” ([Psa.
119.162](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#162)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xxi-p12.1"></span>). By the same words he conquered, of
which he stood in awe. For spoils are stripped from the conquered; as he
was overcome and despoiled of whom it is said in the Gospel, “except he
first bind the strong man.” <span id="fr_5370"></span>[5371](#fn_5370)
But many spoils were found, when, admiring the endurance of the Martyrs,
even the persecutors believed; and they who had plotted to injure our
King by the injury of His soldiers, were gained over by Him in addition.
Whoever therefore standeth in awe of the words of God, fearing lest he
be overcome in the contest, rejoiceth as conqueror in the same words.

<span id="ii.CXIX.xxi-p14"></span>161. “As for iniquity, I hate and
abhor it; but Thy law have I loved” ([Psa.
119.163](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#163)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xxi-p14.1"></span>). That awe, therefore, of His word did
not create hatred of those words, but maintained his love unimpaired.
For the words of God are no other than the law of God. Far be it
therefore that love perish through fear, where fear is chaste. Thus
fathers are at once feared and loved by affectionate sons; thus doth the
chaste wife at once fear her husband, lest she be forsaken by him, and
loveth him, that she may enjoy his love. If then the human father and
the human husband desire at once to be feared and loved; much more doth
our Father who is in heaven, <span id="fr_5371"></span>[5372](#fn_5371)
and that Bridegroom, “beautiful beyond the sons of men,” <span
id="fr_5372"></span>[5373](#fn_5372) not in the flesh, but in goodness.
For by whom is the law of God loved, save by those by whom God is loved?
And what that is severe hath the father’s law to good sons? <span
id="fr_5373"></span>[5374](#fn_5373) Let the Father’s judgments
therefore be praised even in the scourge, if His promises be loved in
the reward.

<span id="ii.CXIX.xxi-p18"></span>162. Such was, assuredly, the conduct
of the Psalmist, who saith, “Seven times a day do I praise Thee, because
of Thy righteous judgments” ([Psa.
119.164](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#164)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xxi-p18.1"></span>). The words “seven times a day,” signify
“evermore.” For this number is wont to be a symbol of universality;
because after six days of the divine work of creation, a seventh of rest
was added; <span id="fr_5374"></span>[5375](#fn_5374) and all times roll
on through a revolving cycle of seven days. For no other reason it was
said, “a just man falleth seven times, and riseth up again:” <span
id="fr_5375"></span>[5376](#fn_5375) that is, the just man perisheth
not, though brought low in every way, yet not induced to transgress,
otherwise he will not be just. For the words, “falleth seven times,” are
employed to express every kind of tribulation, whereby man is cast down
in the sight of men: and the words, “riseth up again,” signify that he
profiteth from all these tribulations. The following sentence in this
passage sufficiently illustrates the foregoing words: for it follows,
“but the wicked shall fall into mischief.” Not to be deprived of
strength in any evils, is therefore the falling seven times, and the
rising again of the just man. Justly hath the Church then praised God
seven times in a day for His righteous judgments; because, when it was
time that judgment should begin at the house of God, <span
id="fr_5376"></span>[5377](#fn_5376) she did not faint in all her
tribulations, but was glorified with the crowns of Martyrs.

<span id="ii.CXIX.xxi-p22"></span>163. “Great is the peace,” he saith,
“that they have who love Thy law: and there is no offence to them”
([Psa. 119.165](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#165)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xxi-p22.1"></span>). Doth this mean that the law itself is
not an offence to them that love it, or that there is no offence from
any source unto them that love the law? But both senses are rightly
understood. For he who loveth the law of God, honoureth in it even what
he doth not understand; and what seemeth to him to sound absurd, he
judgeth rather that he doth not understand, and that there is some great
meaning hidden: thus the law of God is not an offence to him…

<span id="ii.CXIX.xxi-p23"></span>164. “I have waited,” he saith, “for
Thy saving health, O Lord, and have loved Thy commandments” ([Psa.
119.166](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#166)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xxi-p23.1"></span>). For what would it have profited the
righteous of old to have loved the commandments of God, save Christ, who
is the saving health of God, had freed them; by the gift of whose Spirit
also they were able to love the commandments of God? If therefore they
who loved God’s commandments, waited for His saving health; how much
more necessary was Jesus, that is, the saving Health of God, for the
salvation of those that did not love His commandments? This prophecy may
suit also the Saints of the period since the revelation of grace, and
the preaching of the Gospel, for they that love God’s commandments look
for Christ, that “when Christ, our life, shall appear, we” may then
“appear with Him in glory.” <span id="fr_5377"></span>[5378](#fn_5377)

<span id="ii.CXIX.xxi-p25"></span>165. “My soul hath kept Thy
testimonies, and I have loved them exceedingly:” or, as some copies
read, “hath loved them,” understanding, “my soul” ([Psa.
119.167](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#167)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xxi-p25.1"></span>). The testimonies of God are kept, while
they are not denied. This is the office of Martyrs, for testimonies are
called Martyria in Greek. But since it profiteth nothing, even to be
burnt with flames without charity, <span
id="fr_5378"></span>[5379](#fn_5378) he addeth, “and I have loved them
exceedingly.”…For he who loveth, keepeth them in the Spirit of truth and
faithfulness. But generally, while the commandments of God are kept,
they against whose will they are kept become our foes: then, indeed, His
testimonies also must be kept courageously, lest they be denied when the
enemy persecuteth. After the Psalmist, then, had declared that he had
done both these things, he ascribeth unto God his having been enabled to
do so, by adding, “because all my ways are <span id="page_588">p.
588</span> <span id="ii.CXIX.xxi-Page_588"></span>in Thy sight.” He
saith therefore, “I have kept Thy commandments and Thy testimonies;
because all my ways are in Thy sight” ([Psa.
119.168](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#168)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xxi-p26.2"></span>). As much as to say, Hadst Thou turned
away Thy face from me, I should have been confounded, nor could I keep
Thy commandments and testimonies. “I have kept them,” then, because “all
my ways are in Thy sight.” With a look favouring and aiding man, he
meant it to be understood that God seeth his ways: according to the
prayer, “O hide not Thou Thy face from me.” <span
