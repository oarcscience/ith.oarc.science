<span id="ii.LXXVI-p1"></span> <span id="ii.LXXVI-p1.1"></span><span
class="c20"><span id="ii.LXXVI-p1.2"></span>Psalm LXXVI. <span
id="fr_3431"></span>[3432](#fn_3431.md) </span>

<span id="ii.LXXVI-p3"></span>1. The Jews are wont to glory in this
Psalm which we have sung, saying, “Known in Judæa is God, in Israel
great is the name of Him:” and to revile the Gentiles to whom God is not
known, and to say that to themselves alone God is known; seeing that the
Prophet saith, “Known in Judæa is God.” In other places therefore He is
unknown. But God is known in very deed in Judæa, if they understand what
is Judæa. For indeed God is not known except in Judæa. Behold even we
say this, that except a person shall have been in Judæa, known to him
God cannot be. But what saith the Apostle? He that in secret is a Jew,
he that is so in circumcision of the heart, not in letter but in
spirit. <span id="fr_3432"></span>[3433](#fn_3432.md) There are therefore
Jews in circumcision of the flesh, and there are Jews in circumcision of
the heart. Many of our holy fathers <span
id="fr_3433"></span>[3434](#fn_3433.md) had both the circumcision of the
flesh, for a seal of the faith, and circumcision of the heart, for the
faith itself. From these fathers these men degenerating, who now in the
name do glory, and have lost their deeds; from these fathers, I say,
degenerating, they have remained Jews in flesh, in heart Heathens. For
these are Jews, who are out of Abraham, from whom Isaac was born, and
out of him Jacob, and out of Jacob the twelve Patriarchs, and out of the
twelve Patriarchs the whole people of the Jews. <span
id="fr_3434"></span>[3435](#fn_3434.md) But they were generally called Jews
for this reason, that Judah was one of the twelve sons of Jacob, a
Patriarch among the twelve, and from his stock the Royalty came among
the Jews. For all this people after the number of the twelve sons of
Jacob, had twelve tribes. What we call tribes are as it were distinct
houses and congregations of people. That people, I say, had twelve
tribes, out of which twelve tribes one tribe was Judah, out of which
were the kings; and there was another tribe, Levi, out of which were the
priests. But because to the priests serving the temple no land was
allotted, <span id="fr_3435"></span>[3436](#fn_3435.md) but it was
necessary that among twelve tribes all the Land of promise should be
shared: there having been therefore taken out one tribe of higher
dignity, the tribe of Levi, which was of the priests, there would have
remained eleven, unless by the adoption of the two sons of Joseph the
number twelve were completed.

<span id="ii.LXXVI-p8"></span>What this is, observe. One of the twelve
sons of Jacob was Joseph.…This Joseph had two sons, Ephraim and Manasse.
Jacob, dying, as though by will, received those his grandsons into the
number of sons, and said to his son Joseph, “The rest that are born
shall be to thee; but these to me, and they shall divide the land with
their brethren.” <span id="fr_3436"></span>[3437](#fn_3436.md) As yet there
had not been given nor divided the land of promise, but he was speaking
in the Spirit, prophesying. The two sons therefore of Joseph being
added, there were made up nevertheless twelve tribes, since now there
are thirteen. For instead of one tribe of Joseph, two were added, and
there were made thirteen. There being taken out then the tribe of Levi,
that tribe of priests which did serve the Temple, and lived by the
tithes of all the rest unto whom the land was divided, there remain
twelve. In these twelve was the tribe of Judah, whence the kings were.
For at first from another tribe was given King Saul, <span
id="fr_3437"></span>[3438](#fn_3437.md) and he was rejected as being an
evil king; after there was given from the tribe of Judah King David, and
out of him from the tribe of Judah were the Kings. <span
id="fr_3438"></span>[3439](#fn_3438.md) But Jacob had spoken of this, when
he blessed his sons, “there shall not fail a prince out of Judah, nor a
leader from his thighs, until there come He to whom the promise hath
been made.” <span id="fr_3439"></span>[3440](#fn_3439.md) But from the
tribe of Judah there came Our Lord Jesus Christ. For He is, as the
Scripture saith, and as ye have but now heard, out of the seed of David
born of Mary. <span id="fr_3440"></span>[3441](#fn_3440.md) But as
regardeth the Divinity of our Lord Jesus Christ, wherein He is equal
with the Father, He is not only before the Jews, but also before Abraham
himself; <span id="fr_3441"></span>[3442](#fn_3441.md) nor only before
Abraham, but also before Adam; nor only before Adam, but also before
Heaven and earth and before ages: for all things by Himself were made,
and without Him there was made nothing. <span
id="fr_3442"></span>[3443](#fn_3442.md) Because therefore in prophecy hath
been said, “there shall not fail a prince out of Judah,” etc.: <span
id="fr_3443"></span>[3444](#fn_3443.md) former times are examined, and we
find that the Jews always had their kings of the tribe of Judah, and had
no foreign king before that Herod who was king when the Lord was born.
Thence began foreign kings, from Herod. <span
id="fr_3444"></span>[3445](#fn_3444.md) Before Herod all were of the tribe
of Judah, but only until there should come He to whom the promise had
been made. Therefore when the Lord Himself came, the kingdom of the Jews
was overthrown, and removed from the Jews. Now they have no king;
because they will not acknowledge the true King. See now whether they
must be called Jews. Now ye do see that they must not be called Jews.
They have themselves with their own voice resigned that name, so that
they are not worthy to be <span id="page_356">p. 356</span> <span
id="ii.LXXVI-Page_356"></span>called Jews, except only in the flesh.
When did they sever themselves from the name? They said, “We have no
king but Cæsar.” <span id="fr_3445"></span>[3446](#fn_3445.md) O ye who are
called Jews and are not, if ye have no king but Cæsar, there hath failed
a Prince of Judah: there hath come then He to whom the promise hath been
made. They then are more truly Jews, who have been made Christians out
of Jews: the rest of the Jews, who in Christ have not believed, have
deserved to lose even the very name. The true Judæa, then, is the Church
of Christ, believing in that King, who hath come out of the tribe of
Judah through the Virgin Mary; believing in Him of whom the Apostle was
just now speaking, in writing to Timothy, “Be thou mindful that Jesus
Christ hath risen from the dead, of the seed of David, after my
Gospel.” <span id="fr_3446"></span>[3447](#fn_3446.md) For of Judah is
David, and out of David is the Lord Jesus Christ. We believing in Christ
do belong to Judah: and we acknowledge Christ. We, that with eyes have
not seen, in faith do keep Him. Let not therefore the Jews revile, who
are no longer Jews. They said themselves, “We have no king but
Cæsar.” <span id="fr_3447"></span>[3448](#fn_3447.md) For better were it
for them that their king should be Christ, of the seed of David, of the
tribe of Judah. Nevertheless because Christ Himself is of the seed of
David after the flesh, but God above all things blessed for ever, <span
id="fr_3448"></span>[3449](#fn_3448.md) He is Himself our King and our God;
our King, inasmuch as born of the tribe of Judah, after the flesh, was
Christ the Lord, the Saviour; but our God, who is before Judah, and
before Heaven and earth, by whom were made all things, <span
id="fr_3449"></span>[3450](#fn_3449.md) both spiritual and corporal. For if
all things by Himself were made; even Mary herself, out of whom He was
born, by Himself was made.…

<span id="ii.LXXVI-p23"></span>2. “Known in Judæa is God, in Israel
great is the Name of Him” ([Psa.
76.1](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#001.md)<span
id="ii.LXXVI-p23.1"></span>). Concerning Israel also we ought so to take
it as we have concerning Judæa: as they were not the true Jews, so
neither was that the true Israel. For what is Israel said to be? One
seeing God. And how have they seen God, among whom He walked in the
flesh; and while they supposed Him to be man, they slew Him?…“In Israel
great is His Name.” Wilt thou be Israel? Observe that man concerning
whom the Lord saith, “Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom guile is not.”
 <span id="fr_3450"></span>[3451](#fn_3450.md) If a true Israelite is he in
whom guile is not, the guileful and lying are not true Israelites. Let
them not say then, that with them is God, and great is His name in
Israel. Let them prove themselves Israelites, and I grant that “in
Israel great is His Name.”

<span id="ii.LXXVI-p25"></span>3. “And there hath been made in peace a
place for Him, and His habitation is in Sion” ([Psa.
76.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#002.md)<span
id="ii.LXXVI-p25.1"></span>). Again, Sion is as it were the country of
the Jews; the true Sion is the Church of Christians. But the
interpretation of the Hebrew names is thus handed down to us: Judæa is
interpreted confession, Israel, one seeing God. After Judæa is Israel.
Wilt thou see God? First do thou confess, and then in thyself there is
made a place for God; because “there hath been made in peace a place for
Him.” So long as then thou confessest not thy sins, in a manner thou art
quarrelling with God. For how art thou not disputing with Him, who art
praising that which displeaseth Him? He punisheth a thief, thou dost
praise theft: He doth punish a drunken man, thou dost praise
drunkenness. Thou art disputing with God, thou hast not made for Him a
place in thy heart: because in peace is His place. And how dost thou
begin to have peace with God? Thou beginnest with Him in confession.
There is a voice of a Psalm, saying, “Begin ye to the Lord in
confession.” <span id="fr_3451"></span>[3452](#fn_3451.md) What is, “Begin
ye to the Lord in confession”? Begin ye to be joined to the Lord. In
what manner? So that the same thing may displease you as displeaseth
Him. There displeaseth Him thy evil life; if it please thyself, thou art
disunited from Him; if it displease thee, through confession to Him thou
art united.…

<span id="ii.LXXVI-p27"></span>4. “There He hath broken the strength of
bows, and the shield, and the sword, and the battle” ([Psa.
76.3](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#003.md)<span
id="ii.LXXVI-p27.1"></span>). Where hath He broken? In that eternal
peace, in that perfect peace. And now, my brethren, they that have
rightly believed see that they ought not to rely on themselves: and all
the might of their own menaces, and whatsoever is in them whetted for
mischief, this they break in pieces; and whatsoever they deem of great
virtue wherewith to protect themselves temporally, and the war which
they were waging against God by defending their sins, all these things
He hath broken there.

<span id="ii.LXXVI-p28"></span>5. “Thou enlightening marvellously from
the eternal mountains” ([Psa.
76.4](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#004.md)<span
id="ii.LXXVI-p28.1"></span>). What are the eternal mountains? Those
which He hath Himself made eternal; which are the great mountains, the
preachers of truth. Thou dost enlighten, but from the eternal mountains:
the great mountains are first to receive Thy light, and from Thy light
which the mountains receive, the earth also is clothed. But those great
mountains the Apostles have received, the Apostles have received as it
were the first streaks of the rising light.…Wherefore also, in another
place, a Psalm saith what? “I have lifted up mine eyes unto the
mountains, whence there shall come help to me.” <span
id="fr_3452"></span>[3453](#fn_3452.md) What then, in the mountains is thy
hope, and from thence to thee shall there come help? Hast thou stayed at
the mountains? Take heed what thou doest. There <span id="page_357">p.
357</span> <span id="ii.LXXVI-Page_357"></span>is something above the
mountains: above the mountains is He at whom the mountains tremble. “I
have lifted up,” he saith, “mine eyes unto the mountains, whence there
shall come help to me.” But what followeth? “My help,” he saith, “is
from the Lord, who hath made Heaven and earth.”  <span
id="fr_3453"></span>[3454](#fn_3453.md) Unto the mountains indeed I have
lifted up eyes, because through the mountains to me the Scriptures were
displayed: but I have my heart in Him that doth enlighten all
mountains.…

<span id="ii.LXXVI-p31"></span>6. “There have been troubled all the
unwise in heart” ([Psa. 76.5](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#005.md)<span
id="ii.LXXVI-p31.1"></span>).…How have they been troubled? When the
Gospel is preached. And what is life eternal? And who is He that hath
risen from the dead? The Athenians wondered, when the Apostle Paul spake
of the resurrection of the dead, and thought that he spake but
fables. <span id="fr_3454"></span>[3455](#fn_3454.md) But because he said
that there was another life which neither eye hath seen, nor ear heard,
nor hath it gone up into the heart of man, <span
id="fr_3455"></span>[3456](#fn_3455.md) therefore the unwise in heart were
troubled. But what hath befallen them? “They have slept their sleep, and
all men of riches have found nothing in their hands.” They have loved
things present, and have gone to sleep in the midst of things present:
and so these very present things have become to them delightful: just as
he that seeth in a dream himself to have found treasure, is so long rich
as he waketh not. The dream hath made him rich, waking hath made him
poor. Sleep perchance hath held him slumbering on the earth, and lying
on the hard ground, poor and perchance a beggar; in sleep he hath seen
himself to lie on an ivory or golden bed, and on feathers heaped up; so
long as he is sleeping, he is sleeping well, waking he hath found
himself on the hard ground, whereon sleep had taken him. Such men also
are these too: they have come into this life, and through temporal
desires, they have as it were slumbered here; and them riches, and vain
pomps that fly away, have taken, and they have passed away: they have
not understood how much of good might be done therewith. For if they had
known of another life, there they would have laid up unto themselves the
treasure which here was doomed to perish: like as Zacchæus, the chief of
the Publicans, saw that good <span id="fr_3456"></span>[3457](#fn_3456.md)
when he received the Lord Jesus in his house, and he saith, “The half of
my goods I give to the poor, and if to any man I have done any wrong,
fourfold I restore.” <span id="fr_3457"></span>[3458](#fn_3457.md) This man
was not in the emptiness of men dreaming, but in the faith of men
awake.…

<span id="ii.LXXVI-p36"></span>7. “By Thy chiding, O God of Jacob, there
have slept all men that have mounted horses” ([Psa.
76.6](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#006.md)<span
id="ii.LXXVI-p36.1"></span>). Who are they that have mounted horses?
They that would not be humble. To sit on horseback is no sin; but it is
a sin to lift up the neck of power against God, and to deem one’s self
to be in some distinction. Because thou art rich, thou hast mounted; God
doth chide, and thou sleepest. Great is the anger of Him chiding, great
the anger. Let your Love observe the terrible thing. Chiding hath noise,
the noise is wont to make men wake. So great is the force of God
chiding, that he said, “By Thy chiding, O God of Jacob, there have slept
all men that have mounted horses.” Behold what a sleep that Pharaoh
slept who mounted horses. For he was not awake in heart, because against
chiding he had his heart hardened. <span
id="fr_3458"></span>[3459](#fn_3458.md) For hardness of heart is slumber. I
ask you, my brethren, how they sleep, who, while the Gospel is sounding,
and the Amen, and the Hallelujah, throughout the whole world, yet will
not condemn their old life, and wake up unto a new life. There was the
Scripture of God in Judæa only, now throughout the whole world it is
sung. In that one nation one God who made all things was spoken of, as
to be adored and worshipped; now where is He unsaid? Christ hath risen
again, though derided on the Cross; that very Cross whereon He was
derided, He hath now imprinted on the brows of kings: and men yet
sleep.…

<span id="ii.LXXVI-p38"></span>8. “Thou art terrible, and who shall
withstand Thee at that time by Thine anger?” ([Psa.
76.7](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#007.md)<span
id="ii.LXXVI-p38.1"></span>). Now they sleep, and perceive not Thee
angry; but for cause that they should sleep, He was angry. Now that
which sleeping they perceived not, at the end they shall perceive. For
there shall appear the Judge of quick and dead. “And who shall withstand
Thee at that time by Thine anger?” For now they speak that which they
will, and they dispute against God and say, who are the Christians? or
who is Christ? or what fools are they that believe that which they see
not, and relinquish the pleasures which they see, and follow the faith
of things which are not displayed to their eyes! Ye sleep and
snore, <span id="fr_3459"></span>[3460](#fn_3459.md) ye speak against God,
as much as ye are able. “How long shall sinners, O Lord, how long shall
sinners glory, they answer and will speak iniquity?” <span
id="fr_3460"></span>[3461](#fn_3460.md) But when doth no one answer and no
one speak, except when he turneth himself <span
id="fr_3461"></span>[3462](#fn_3461.md) against himself?…

<span id="ii.LXXVI-p42"></span>9. “From Heaven Thou hast hurled
judgment: the earth hath trembled, and hath rested” ([Psa.
76.8](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#008.md)<span
id="ii.LXXVI-p42.1"></span>). She which now doth trouble herself, she
which now speaketh, hath to fear at the end and to rest. Better had she
now rested, that at the end she might have rejoiced. Rested? When? “When
God arose unto judgment, that He might save all the meek in heart”
([Psa. 76.9](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#009.md)<span
id="ii.LXXVI-p42.2"></span>). Who are the meek in heart? They that on
<span id="page_358">p. 358</span> <span
id="ii.LXXVI-Page_358"></span>snorting horses have not mounted, but in
their humility have confessed their own sins. “For the thought of a man
shall confess to Thee, and the remnants of the thought shall celebrate
solemnities to Thee” ([Psa. 76.10](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#010.md)<span
id="ii.LXXVI-p42.3"></span>). The first is the thought, the latter are
the remnants of the thought. What is the first thought? That from whence
we begin, that good thought whence thou wilt begin to confess.
Confession uniteth us to Christ. But now the confession itself, that is,
the first thought, doth produce in us the remnants of the thought: and
those very “remnants of thought shall celebrate solemnities to Thee.”
What is the thought which shall confess? That which condemneth the
former life, that whereunto that which it was is displeasing, in order
that it may be that which it was not, is itself the first thought. But
because thus thou oughtest to withdraw from sins, with the first thought
after having confessed to God, that it may not escape thy memory that
thou hast been a sinner; in that thou hast been a sinner, thou dost
celebrate solemnities to God. Furthermore it is to be understood as
followeth. The first thought hath confession, and departure from the old
life. But if thou shalt have forgotten from what sins thou hast been
delivered, thou dost not render thanks to the Deliverer, and dost not
celebrate solemnities to thy God. Behold the first confessing thought of
Saul the Apostle, now Paul, who at first was Saul, when he heard a voice
from Heaven!…He put forth the first thought of obedience: when he heard,
“I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest,” “O Lord,” he saith,
“what dost Thou bid me to do?” <span
id="fr_3462"></span>[3463](#fn_3462.md) This is a thought confessing: now
he is calling upon the Lord, whom he persecuted. In what manner the
remnants of the thought shall celebrate solemnities, in the case of Paul
ye have heard, when the Apostle himself was being read: “Be thou mindful
that Christ Jesus hath risen from the dead, of the seed of David, after
my Gospel.” <span id="fr_3463"></span>[3464](#fn_3463.md) What is, be thou
mindful? Though effaced from thy memory be the thought, whereby at first
thou hast confessed: be the remnant of the thought in the memory.…

<span id="ii.LXXVI-p45"></span>10. Even once was Christ sacrificed
for <span id="fr_3464"></span>[3465](#fn_3464.md) us, when we believed;
then was thought; but now there are the remnants of thought, when we
remember Who hath come to us, and what He hath forgiven us; by means of
those very remnants of thought, that is, by means of the memory herself,
He is daily so sacrificed for us, <span
id="fr_3465"></span>[3466](#fn_3465.md) as if He were daily renewing us,
that hath renewed us by His first grace. For now the Lord hath renewed
us in Baptism, and we have become new men, in hope indeed rejoicing, in
order that in tribulation we may be patient: <span
id="fr_3466"></span>[3467](#fn_3466.md) nevertheless, there ought not to
escape from our memory that which hath been bestowed upon us. And if now
thy thought is not what it was,—for the first thought was to depart from
sin: but now thou dost not depart, but at that time didst depart,—be
there remnants of thought, lest He who hath made whole escape from
memory.…

<span id="ii.LXXVI-p49"></span>11. “Vow ye, and pay to the Lord our God”
([Psa. 76.11](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#011.md)<span
id="ii.LXXVI-p49.1"></span>). Let each man vow what he is able, and pay
it. Do not vow and not pay: but let every man vow, and pay what he can.
Be ye not slow to vow: for ye will accomplish the vows by powers not
your own. Ye will fail, if on yourselves ye rely: but if on Him to whom
ye vow ye rely, ye will be safe to pay. “Vow ye, and pay to the Lord our
God.” What ought we all in common to vow? To believe in Him, to hope
from Him for life eternal, to live godly according to a measure common
to all. For there is a certain measure common to all men. To commit no
theft is not a thing enjoined *merely* upon one devoted to
continence, <span id="fr_3467"></span>[3468](#fn_3467.md) and not enjoined
upon the married woman: to commit no adultery is enjoined upon all men:
not to love wine-bibbing, whereby the soul is swallowed up, and doth
corrupt in herself the Temple of God, is enjoined to all alike: not to
be proud, is enjoined to all men alike: not to slay man, not to hate a
brother, not to lay a plot to destroy any one, is enjoined to all in
common. The whole of this we all ought to vow. There are also vows
proper for individuals: one voweth to God conjugal chastity, that he
will know no other woman besides his wife: <span
id="fr_3468"></span>[3469](#fn_3468.md) so also the woman, that she will
know no other man besides her husband. Other men also vow, even though
they have used such a marriage, that beyond this they will have no such
thing, that they will neither desire nor admit the like: and these men
have vowed a greater vow than the former. Others vow even virginity from
the beginning of life, that they will even know no such thing as those
who having experienced have relinquished: and these men have vowed the
greatest vow. Others vow that their house shall be a place of
entertainment for all the Saints that may come: a great vow they vow.
Another voweth to relinquish all his goods to be distributed to the
poor, and go into a community, into a society of the Saints: a great vow
he doth vow. “Vow ye, and pay to the Lord our God.” Let each one vow
what he shall have willed to vow; let him give heed to this, that he pay
what he hath vowed. If any man doth look back with regard to what he
hath vowed to God, it <span id="page_359">p. 359</span> <span
id="ii.LXXVI-Page_359"></span>is an evil. Some woman or other devoted to
continence hath willed to marry: what hath she willed? The same as any
virgin. What hath she willed? The same as her own mother. Hath she
willed any evil thing? Evil certainly. Why? Because already she had
vowed to the Lord her God. For what hath the apostle Paul said
concerning such? Though he saith that young widows may marry if they
will: <span id="fr_3469"></span>[3470](#fn_3469.md) nevertheless he saith
in a certain passage, “but more blessed she will be, if so she shall
have remained, after my judgment.” <span
id="fr_3470"></span>[3471](#fn_3470.md) He showeth that she is more
blessed, if so she shall have remained; but nevertheless that she is not
to be condemned, if she shall have willed to marry. But what saith he
concerning certain who have vowed and have not paid? “Having,” he saith,
“judgment, because the first faith they have made void.” <span
id="fr_3471"></span>[3472](#fn_3471.md) What is, “the first faith they have
made void”? They have vowed, and have not paid. Let no brother
therefore, when placed in a monastery, say, I shall depart from the
monastery: for neither are they only that are in a monastery to attain
unto the kingdom of Heaven, nor do those that are not there not belong
unto God. We answer him, but they have not vowed; thou hast vowed, thou
hast looked back. When the Lord was threatening them with the day of
judgment, He saith what? “Remember Lot’s wife.” <span
id="fr_3472"></span>[3473](#fn_3472.md) To all men He spake. For what did
Lot’s wife? She was delivered from Sodom, and being in the way she
looked back. In the place where she looked back, there she remained. For
she became a statue of salt, <span id="fr_3473"></span>[3474](#fn_3473.md)
in order that by considering her men might be seasoned, might have
sense, might not be infatuated, might not look back, lest by giving a
bad example they should themselves remain and season others. For even
now we are saying this to certain of our brethren, whom perchance we may
have seen as it were weak in the good they have purposed. And wilt thou
be such an one as he was? We put before them certain who have looked
back. They are savourless  <span id="fr_3474"></span>[3475](#fn_3474.md) in
themselves, but they season others, inasmuch as they are mentioned, in
order that fearing their example they may not look back. “Vow ye, and
pay.” For that wife of Lot to all doth belong. A married woman hath had
the will to commit adultery; from her place whither she had arrived she
looked back. A widow who had vowed so to remain hath willed to marry,
she hath willed the thing which was lawful to her who hath married, but
to herself was not lawful, because from her place she hath looked back.
There is a virgin devoted to continence, already dedicated to God; let
her have <span id="fr_3475"></span>[3476](#fn_3475.md) also the other gifts
which truly do adorn virginity itself, and without which that virginity
is unclean. For what if she be uncorrupt in body and corrupt in mind?
What is it that he hath said? What if no one hath touched the body, but
if perchance she be drunken, be proud, be contentious, be talkative? All
these things God doth condemn. If before she had vowed, she had married,
she would not have been condemned: she hath chosen something better,
hath overcome that which was lawful for her; she is proud, and doth
commit so many things unlawful. This I say, it is lawful for her to
marry before that she voweth, to be proud is never lawful. O thou virgin
of God, thou hast willed not to marry, which is lawful: thou dost exalt
thyself, which is not lawful. Better is a virgin humble, than a married
woman humble: but better is a married woman humble, than a virgin proud.
But she that looked back upon marriage is condemned, not because she
hath willed to marry; but because she had already gone before, and is
become the wife of Lot by looking back. Be ye not slow, that are able,
whom God doth inspire to seize upon higher callings: for we do not say
these things in order that ye may not vow, but in order that ye may vow
and may pay. Now because we have treated of these matters, thou
perchance wast willing to vow, and now art not willing to vow. But
observe what the Psalm hath said to thee. It hath not said, “Vow not;”
but, “Vow and pay.” Because thou hast heard, “pay,” wilt thou not vow?
Therefore wast thou willing to vow, and not to pay? Nay, do both. One
thing is done by thy profession, another thing will be perfected by the
aid of God. Look to Him who doth guide thee, and thou wilt not look back
to the place whence He is leading thee forth. He that guideth thee is
walking before thee; the place from whence He is guiding thee is behind
thee. Love Him guiding, and He doth not condemn thee looking back.

<span id="ii.LXXVI-p60"></span>12. “All they that are in the circuit of
Him shall offer gifts.” Who are in the circuit of Him?…Whatever is
common to all is in the midst. Why is it said to be in the midst?
Because it is at the same distance from all, and at the same proximity
to all. That which is not in the middle, is as it were private. That
which is public is set in the middle, in order that all they that come
may use the same, may be enlightened. Let no one say, it is mine: lest
he should be wanting to make his own share of that which is in the midst
for all. What then is, “All <span id="page_360">p. 360</span> <span
id="ii.LXXVI-Page_360"></span>they that are in the circuit of Him shall
offer gifts”? All they that understand truth to be common to all, and
who do not make it as it were their own by being proud concerning it,
they shall offer gifts; because they have humility: but they that make
as it were their own that which is common to all, as though it were set
in the middle, are endeavouring to lead men astray to a party, these
shall not offer gifts.…“To Him terrible.” Let therefore all men fear
that are in the circuit of Him. For therefore they shall fear, and with
trembling they shall praise; because they are in the circuit of Him, to
the end that all men may attain unto Him, and He may openly meet all,
and openly enlighten all. This is, to stand in awe with others. <span
id="fr_3477"></span>[3478](#fn_3477.md) When thou hast made him as it were
thine own, and no longer common, thou art exalted unto pride; though it
is written, “Serve ye the Lord in fear, and exult unto Him with
trembling.” <span id="fr_3478"></span>[3479](#fn_3478.md) Therefore they
shall offer gifts, who are in the circuit of Him. For they are humble
who know truth to be common to all.

<span id="ii.LXXVI-p63"></span>13. To whom shall they offer gifts? “To
Him terrible, and to Him that taketh away the spirit of princes” ([Psa.
76.12](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#012.md)<span
id="ii.LXXVI-p63.1"></span>). For the spirits of princes are proud
spirits. They then are not His Spirits; for if they know anything, their
own they will it to be, not public; but, that which setteth Himself
forth as equal toward all men, that setteth Himself in the midst, in
order that all men may take as much as they can, whatever they can; not
of what is any man’s, but of what is God’s, and therefore of their own
because they have become His. Therefore they must needs be humble: they
have lost their own spirit, and they have the Spirit of God.…For if thou
shalt have confessed thyself dust, God out of dust doth make <span
id="fr_3479"></span>[3480](#fn_3479.md) man. All they that are in the
circuit of Him do offer gifts. All humble men do confess to Him, and do
adore Him. “To Him terrible they offer gifts.” Whence to Him terrible
exult ye with trembling: <span id="fr_3480"></span>[3481](#fn_3480.md) “and
to Him that taketh away the spirit of princes:” that is, that taketh
away the haughtiness of proud men. “To Him terrible among the kings of
the earth.” Terrible are the kings of the earth, but He is above all,
that doth terrify the kings of the earth. Be thou a king of the earth,
and God will be to thee terrible. How, wilt thou say, shall I be a king
of the earth? Rule the earth, and thou wilt be a king of the earth. Do
not therefore with desire of empire set before thine eyes exceeding wide
provinces, where thou mayest spread abroad thy kingdoms; rule thou the
earth which thou bearest. Hear the Apostle ruling the earth: “I do not
so fight as if beating air, but I chasten my body, and bring it into
captivity, lest perchance preaching to other men, I myself become a
reprobate.” <span id="fr_3481"></span>[3482](#fn_3481.md) …
