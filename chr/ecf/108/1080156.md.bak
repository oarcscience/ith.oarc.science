<span id="ii.CXXIII-p1"></span> <span id="ii.CXXIII-p1.1"></span><span
class="c20"><span id="ii.CXXIII-p1.2"></span>Psalm CXXIII. <span
id="fr_5447"></span>[5448](#fn_5447.md) </span>

<span id="ii.CXXIII-p3"></span>1. …Let this singer ascend; and let this
man sing from the heart of each of you, and let each of you be this man,
for when each of you saith this, since ye are all one in Christ, one man
saith this; and saith not, “Unto Thee, O Lord, have” we “lift up” our
“eyes;” but, “Unto Thee, O Lord, have I lift up mine eyes” ([Psa.
123.1](../../../bib/kjv/psa123.htm#001.md)<span
id="ii.CXXIII-p3.1"></span>). Ye ought indeed to imagine that every one
of you is speaking; but that One in an especial sense speaketh, who is
also spread abroad over the whole world…

<span id="ii.CXXIII-p4"></span>What maketh the heart of a Christian
heavy? Because he is a pilgrim, and longeth for his country. If thy
heart be heavy on this score, although thou hast been prosperous in the
world, still thou dost groan: and if all things combine to render thee
prosperous, and this world smile upon thee on every side, thou
nevertheless groanest, because thou seest that thou art set in a
pilgrimage; and feelest that thou hast indeed happiness in the eyes of
fools, but not as yet after the promise of Christ: this thou seekest
with groans, this thou seekest with longings, and by longing ascendest,
and while thou ascendest dost sing the Song of Degrees.

<span id="ii.CXXIII-p5"></span>2. …Where then are the ladders? For we
behold so great an interval between heaven and earth, there is so wide a
separation, and so great a space of regions between: we wish to climb
thither, we see no ladder; do we deceive ourselves, because we sing the
Song of Degrees, that is, the Song of ascent? We ascend unto heaven, if
we think of God, who hath made ascending steps in the heart. What is to
ascend in heart? To advance towards God. As every man who faileth, doth
not descend, but falleth: so every one who profiteth doth ascend: but if
he so profit, as to avoid pride: if he so ascend as not to fall: but if
while he profiteth he become proud, in ascending he again falleth. But
that he may not be proud, what ought he to do? Let him lift up his eyes
unto Him who dwelleth in heaven, let him not heed himself…

<span id="ii.CXXIII-p6"></span>3. If, my brethren, we understand by
heaven the firmament which we see with our bodily eyes, we shall indeed
so err, as to imagine that we cannot ascend thither without ladders, or
some scaling machines: but if we ascend spiritually, we ought to
understand heaven spiritually: if the ascent be in affection, heaven is
in righteousness. What is then the heaven of God? All holy souls, all
righteous souls. For the Apostles also, although they were on earth in
the flesh, were heaven; for the Lord, enthroned in them, traversed the
whole world. He then dwelleth in heaven. How?…How long are they the
temple according to faith? As long as Christ dwelleth in them through
faith; as the Apostle saith, “That Christ may dwell in your hearts
through faith.” But they are already heaven in whom God already dwelleth
visibly, who see Him face to face; all the holy Apostles, all the holy
Virtues, Powers, Thrones, Lordships, that heavenly Jerusalem, wanderers
from whence we groan, and for which we pray with longing; and there God
dwelleth. Thither hath the Psalmist <span id="page_597">p. 597</span>
<span id="ii.CXXIII-Page_597"></span>lifted up his faith, thither he
riseth in affection, with longing hopes: and this very longing causeth
the soul to purge off <span id="fr_5448"></span>[5449](#fn_5448.md) the
filth of sins, and to be cleansed from every stain, that itself also may
become heaven; because it hath lifted up its eyes unto Him who dwelleth
in heaven. For if we have determined that that heaven which we see with
our bodily eyes is the dwelling of God, the dwelling of God will pass
away; for “heaven and earth will pass away.” <span
id="fr_5449"></span>[5450](#fn_5449.md) Then, before God created heaven and
earth, where did He dwell? But some one saith: and before God made the
Saints, where did He dwell? God dwelt in Himself, he dwelt with Himself,
and God is with Himself. And when He deigneth to dwell in the Saints,
the Saints are not the house of God in such wise, as that God should
fall when it is withdrawn. For we dwell in a house in one way, in
another way God dwelleth in the Saints. Thou dwellest in a house: if it
be withdrawn, thou fallest: but God so dwelleth in the Saints, that if
He should Himself depart, they fall…

<span id="ii.CXXIII-p9"></span>4. What then followeth, since he hath
said, “Unto Thee do I lift up mine eyes”? ([Psa.
123.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa123.htm#002.md)<span
id="ii.CXXIII-p9.1"></span>). How hast thou lifted up thine eyes?
“Behold, even as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their
masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress: even
so our eyes wait upon the Lord our God, until He have mercy upon us.” We
are both servants, and a handmaiden: He is both our Master and our
Mistress. What do these words mean? What do these similitudes mean? It
is not wonderful if we are servants, and He our Master; but it is
wonderful if we are a maiden, and He our Mistress. But not even our
being a maiden is wonderful; for we are the Church: nor is it wonderful
that He is our Mistress; for He is the Power and the Wisdom of God…When
therefore thou hearest Christ, lift up thine eyes to the hands of thy
Master; when thou hearest the Power of God and the Wisdom of God, lift
up thine eyes to the hands of thy Mistress; for thou art both servant
and handmaiden; servant, for thou art a people; <span
id="fr_5450"></span>[5451](#fn_5450.md) handmaiden, <span
id="fr_5451"></span>[5452](#fn_5451.md) for thou art the Church. But this
maiden hath found great dignity with God; she hath been made a wife. But
until she come unto those spiritual embraces, where she may without
apprehension enjoy Him whom she hath loved, and for whom she hath sighed
in this tedious pilgrimage, she is betrothed: and hath received a mighty
pledge, the blood of the Spouse for whom she sigheth without fear. Nor
is it said unto her, Do not love; as it is sometimes said to any
betrothed virgin, not as yet married: and is justly said, Do not love;
when thou hast become a wife, then love: it is rightly said, because it
is a precipitate and preposterous thing, and not a chaste desire, to
love one whom she knoweth not whether she shall marry. For it may happen
that one man may be betrothed to her, and another man marry her. But as
there is no one else who can be preferred to Christ, let her love
without apprehension: and before she is joined unto Him, let her love,
and sigh from a distance and from her far pilgrimage…

<span id="ii.CXXIII-p12"></span>5. “For we have been much filled with
contempt” ([Psa. 123.3](../../../bib/kjv/psa123.htm#003.md)<span
id="ii.CXXIII-p12.1"></span>). All that will live piously according to
Christ, must needs suffer reproof, <span
id="fr_5452"></span>[5453](#fn_5452.md) must needs be despised by those who
do not choose to live piously, all whose happiness is earthly. They are
derided who call that happiness which they cannot see with their eyes,
and it is said to them, What believest thou, madman? Dost thou see what
thou believest? Hath any one returned from the world below, and reported
to thee what is going on there? Behold I see and enjoy what I love. Thou
art scorned, because thou dost hope for what thou seest not; and he who
seemeth to hold what he seeth, scorneth thee. Consider well if he doth
really hold it…I have my house, he hath boasted himself. Thou askest,
what house of his own? That which my father left me. And whence did he
derive this house? My grandfather left it him. Go back even to his great
grandfather, then to his great grandfather’s father, and he can no
longer tell their names. Art thou not rather terrified by this thought,
that thou seest many have passed through this house, and that none of
them hath carried it away with him to his everlasting home? Thy father
left it: he passed through it: thus thou also wilt pass by. If therefore
thou hast a mere passing stay in thy house, it is an inn for passing
guests, not an habitation for permanent abode. Yet since we hope for
those things which are to come, and sigh for future happiness, and since
it hath not yet appeared what we shall be, although we are already “sons
of God;” <span id="fr_5453"></span>[5454](#fn_5453.md) for “our life is
hidden with Christ in God:” <span id="fr_5454"></span>[5455](#fn_5454.md)
“we are utterly despised,” by those who seek or enjoy happiness in this
world.

<span id="ii.CXXIII-p16"></span>6. “Our soul is filled exceedingly; a
reproach to the wealthy, and a contempt to the proud” ([Psa.
123.4](../../../bib/kjv/psa123.htm#004.md)<span
id="ii.CXXIII-p16.1"></span>). We were asking who were “the wealthy:” he
hath expounded to thee, in that he hath said, “the proud.” “Reproach”
and “contempt” are the same: and “wealthy” is the same with “proud.” It
is a repetition of the sentence, “a reproach to the wealthy, and a
contempt to the proud.” Why are the proud wealthy? Because they wish to
be happy here. Why? since they themselves too are miserable, are they
wealthy? But perhaps when they are <span id="page_598">p. 598</span>
<span id="ii.CXXIII-Page_598"></span>miserable, they do not mock us.
Listen, my beloved. Then perchance they mock when they are happy, when
they boast themselves in the pomp of their riches! when they boast
themselves in the inflated state of false honours: then they mock us,
and seem to say, Behold, it is well with me: I enjoy the good things
before me: let those who promise what they cannot show depart from me:
what I see, I hold; what I see, I enjoy; may I fare well in this life.
Be thou more secure; for Christ hath risen again, and hath taught thee
what He will give in another life: be assured that He giveth it. But
that man mocketh thee, because he holdeth what he hath. Bear with his
mockeries, and thou wilt laugh at his groans: for afterwards there will
come a season when these very persons will say, “This was he whom we had
sometimes in derision.”  <span id="fr_5455"></span>[5456](#fn_5455.md) …

<span id="ii.CXXIII-p18"></span>7. To this we must add, that sometimes
those also who are beneath the scourge of temporal unhappiness, mock
us…Did not the robber <span id="fr_5456"></span>[5457](#fn_5456.md) mock,
who was crucified with our crucified Lord? If therefore they who are not
wealthy mock us, why doth the Psalm say, “A reproach to the wealthy”? If
we carefully sift the matter, even these (the unfortunate) are wealthy.
How are they wealthy? Yea; for if they were not wealthy, they would not
be proud. For one man is wealthy in money, and proud on that score:
another is wealthy in honours, and is proud on that account: another
imagines himself wealthy in righteousness, and hence his pride, which is
worse. They who seem not to be wealthy in money, seem to themselves to
be wealthy in righteousness towards God; and when calamity overtakes
them, they justify themselves, accuse God, and say, What wrong have I
been guilty of, or, what have I done? Thou repliest: Look back, call to
mind thy sins, see if thou hast done nothing. He is somewhat touched in
conscience, and returneth to himself, and thinketh of his evil deeds;
and when he hath thought of his evil deeds, not even then doth he choose
to confess that he deserves his sufferings; but saith, Behold, I have
clearly done many things; but I see that many have done worse, and
suffer no evil. He is righteous against God. He also therefore is
wealthy: he hath his breast puffed out with righteousness; since God
seemeth to him to do ill, and he seemeth to himself to suffer unjustly.
And if thou gavest him a vessel to pilot, he would be shipwrecked with
it: yet he wishes to deprive God of the government of this world, and
himself to hold the helm of Creation, and to distribute among all men
pains and pleasures, punishments and rewards. Miserable soul! yet why do
ye wonder? He is wealthy, but wealthy in iniquity, wealthy in malignity;
but is more wealthy in iniquity, in proportion as he seemeth to himself
to be wealthy in righteousness.

<span id="ii.CXXIII-p20"></span>8. But a Christian ought not to be
wealthy, but ought to acknowledge himself poor; and if he hath riches,
he ought to know that they are not true riches, so that he may desire
others…And what is the wealth of our righteousness? How much soever
righteousness there may be in us, it is a sort of dew compared to that
fountain: <span id="fr_5457"></span>[5458](#fn_5457.md) compared to that
plenteousness it is as a few drops, which may soften our life, and relax
our hard iniquity. Let us only desire to be filled with the full
fountain of righteousness, let us long to be filled with that abundant
richness, of which it is said in the Psalm, “They shall be satisfied
with the plenteousness of Thy house: and Thou shalt give them drink out
of the torrent of Thy pleasure.” <span
id="fr_5458"></span>[5459](#fn_5458.md) But while we are here, let us
understand ourselves to be destitute and in want; not only in respect of
those riches which are not the true riches, but of salvation itself. And
when we are whole, let us understand that we are weak. For as long as
this body hungers and thirsts, as long as this body is weary with
watching, weary with standing, weary with walking, weary with sitting,
weary with eating; whithersoever it turneth itself for a relief from
weariness, there it discovereth another source of fatigue: there is
therefore no perfect soundness, not even in the body itself. Those
riches are then not riches, but beggary; for the more they abound, the
more doth destitution and avarice increase…Let then our whole hunger,
our whole thirst, be for true riches, and true health, and true
righteousness. What are true riches? That heavenly abode in Jerusalem.
For who is called rich on this earth? When a rich man is praised, what
is meant? He is very rich: nothing is wanting to him. That surely is the
praise of him that praiseth the other: for it is not this, when it is
said, He wants nothing. Consider if he really want nothing. If he
desires nothing, he wants nothing: but if he still desires more than
what he hath, his riches have increased in such wise, that his wants
have increased also. But in that City there will be true riches, because
there will be nothing wanting to us there; for we shall not be in need
of anything, and there will be true health…
