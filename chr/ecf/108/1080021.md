<span id="ii.XVII-p1"></span> <span id="ii.XVII-p1.1"></span><span
class="c20"><span id="ii.XVII-p1.2"></span>Psalm XVII. <span
id="fr_512"></span>[513](#fn_512.md) </span>

<span id="ii.XVII-p3"></span>A prayer of David himself.

<span id="ii.XVII-p4"></span>1. This prayer must be assigned to the
Person of the Lord, with the addition of the Church, which is His body.

<span id="ii.XVII-p5"></span>2. “Hear My righteousness, O God, consider
My supplication” ([Psa. 17.1](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#001.md)<span
id="ii.XVII-p5.1"></span>). “Hearken unto My prayer, not in deceitful
lips:” not going forth to Thee in deceitful lips. “Let My judgment from
Thy countenance go forth” ([Psa.
17.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#002)<span id="ii.XVII-p5.2"></span>.md).
From the enlightening of the knowledge of Thee, let Me judge truth. Or
at least, let My judgment go forth, not in deceitful lips, from Thy
countenance, that is, that I may not in judging utter aught else than I
understand in Thee. “Let Mine eyes see equity:” the eyes, of course, of
the heart.

<span id="ii.XVII-p6"></span>3. “Thou hast proved and visited Mine heart
in the night-season” ([Psa. 17.3](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#003.md)<span
id="ii.XVII-p6.1"></span>). For this Mine heart hath been proved by the
visitation of tribulation. “Thou hast examined Me by fire, and iniquity
hath not been found in Me.” Now not night only, in that it is wont to
disturb, but fire also, in that it burns, is this tribulation to be
called; whereby when I was examined I was found righteous.

<span id="ii.XVII-p7"></span>4. “That My mouth may not speak the works
of men” ([Psa. 17.4](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#004.md)<span
id="ii.XVII-p7.1"></span>). That nothing may proceed out of My mouth,
but what relates to Thy glory and praise; not to the works of men, which
they do beside Thy will. “Because of the words of Thy lips.” <span
id="fr_513"></span>[514](#fn_513.md) Because of the words of Thy peace, or
of Thy prophets. “I have kept hard ways.” I have kept the toilsome ways
of human mortality and suffering.

<span id="ii.XVII-p9"></span>5. “To perfect My steps in Thy paths”
([Psa. 17.5](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#005.md)<span
id="ii.XVII-p9.1"></span>). That the love of the Church might be
perfected in the strait ways, whereby she arrives at Thy rest. “That My
footsteps be not moved.” That the signs of My way, which, like
footsteps, have been imprinted on the Sacraments and Apostolical
writings, be not moved, that they may mark them who would follow Me. Or
at least, that I may still abide fixedly in eternity, after that I have
accomplished the hard ways, and have finished My steps in the straits of
Thy paths.

<span id="ii.XVII-p10"></span>6. “I have cried out, for Thou hast heard
Me, O God” ([Psa. 17.6](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#006.md)<span
id="ii.XVII-p10.1"></span>). With a free and strong effort have I
directed My prayers unto Thee: for that I might have this power, Thou
hast heard Me when praying more weakly. “Incline Thine ear to Me, and
hear My words.” Let not Thy hearing forsake My humiliation.

<span id="ii.XVII-p11"></span>7. “Make Thy mercies marvellous” ([Psa.
17.7](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#007)<span id="ii.XVII-p11.1"></span>.md).
Let not Thy mercies be disesteemed, lest they be loved too little.

<span id="ii.XVII-p12"></span>8. “Who savest them that hope in Thee from
such as resist Thy right hand:” from such as resist the favour, whereby
Thou favourest Me. “Keep Me, O Lord, as the apple of Thine eye” ([Psa.
17.8](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#008)<span id="ii.XVII-p12.1"></span>.md):
which seems very little and minute: yet by it is the sight of the eye
directed, whereby the light is distinguished from the darkness; as by
Christ’s humanity, the divinity of the Judgment <span
id="fr_514"></span>[515](#fn_514.md) distinguishing between the righteous
and <span id="page_50">p. 50</span> <span
id="ii.XVII-Page_50"></span>sinners. “In the covering of Thy wings
protect Me.” In the defence of Thy love and mercy protect Me. “From the
face of the ungodly who have troubled Me” ([Psa.
17.9](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#009)<span id="ii.XVII-p13.1"></span>.md).

<span id="ii.XVII-p14"></span>9. “Mine enemies have compassed about My
soul;” “they have shut up their own fat” ([Psa.
17.10](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#010.md)<span
id="ii.XVII-p14.1"></span>). They have been covered with their own gross
joy, after that their desire hath been satiated with wickedness. “Their
mouth hath spoken pride.” And therefore their mouth spoke pride, in
saying, “Hail, King of the Jews,” <span
id="fr_515"></span>[516](#fn_515.md) and other like words.

<span id="ii.XVII-p16"></span>10. “Casting Me forth they have now
compassed Me about” ([Psa. 17.11](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#011.md)<span
id="ii.XVII-p16.1"></span>). Casting Me forth outside the city, they
have now compassed Me about on the Cross. “Their eyes they have
determined to turn down on the earth.” The bent of their heart they have
determined to turn down on these earthly things: deeming Him, who was
slain, to endure a mighty evil, and themselves, that slew Him, none.

<span id="ii.XVII-p17"></span>11. “As a lion ready for prey, have they
taken Me” ([Psa. 17.12](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#012.md)<span
id="ii.XVII-p17.1"></span>). They have taken Me, like that adversary who
“walketh about, seeking whom he may devour.” <span
id="fr_516"></span>[517](#fn_516.md) “And as a lion’s whelp dwelling in
secret places.” And as his whelp, the people to whom it was said, “Ye
are of your father the devil:” <span id="fr_517"></span>[518](#fn_517.md)
meditating on the snares, whereby they might circumvent and destroy the
just One.

<span id="ii.XVII-p20"></span>12. “Arise, O Lord, prevent them, and cast
them down” ([Psa. 17.13](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#013.md)<span
id="ii.XVII-p20.1"></span>). Arise, O Lord, Thou whom they suppose to be
asleep, and regardless of men’s iniquities; be they blinded before by
their own malice, that vengeance may prevent their deed; and so cast
them down.

<span id="ii.XVII-p21"></span>13. “Deliver My soul from the ungodly.”
Deliver My soul, by restoring Me after the death, which the ungodly have
inflicted on Me. “Thy weapon: from the enemies of Thine hand” ([Psa.
17.14](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#014.md)<span
id="ii.XVII-p21.1"></span>). For My soul is Thy weapon, which Thy hand,
that is, Thy eternal Power, hath taken to subdue thereby the kingdoms of
iniquity, and divide the righteous from the ungodly. This weapon then
“deliver from the enemies of Thine hand,” that is, of Thy Power, that
is, from Mine enemies. “Destroy them, O Lord, from off the earth,
scatter them in their life.” O Lord, destroy them from off the earth,
which they inhabit, scatter them throughout the world in this life,
which only they think their life, who <span
id="fr_518"></span>[519](#fn_518.md) despair of life eternal. “And by Thy
hidden things their belly hath been filled.” Now not only this visible
punishment shall overtake them, but also their memory hath been filled
with sins, which as darkness are hidden from the light of Thy truth,
that they should forget God. “They have been filled with swine’s flesh.”
They have been filled with uncleanness, treading under foot the pearls
of God’s words. “And they have left the rest to their babes:” crying
out, “This sin be upon us and upon our children.” <span
id="fr_519"></span>[520](#fn_519.md)

<span id="ii.XVII-p24"></span>14. “But I shall appear in Thy
righteousness in Thy sight” ([Psa.
17.15](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#015.md)<span
id="ii.XVII-p24.1"></span>). But I, Who have not appeared to them that,
with their filthy and darkened heart, cannot see the light of wisdom, “I
shall appear in Thy righteousness in Thy sight.”

<span id="ii.XVII-p25"></span>“I shall be satiated, when Thy glory shall
be manifested.” And when they have been satiated with their uncleanness,
that they could not know Me, I shall be satiated, when Thy glory shall
be manifested, in them that know Me. In that verse indeed where it is
said, “filled with swine’s flesh,” some copies have, “filled with
children:” for from the ambiguity of the Greek <span
id="fr_520"></span>[521](#fn_520.md) a double interpretation has resulted.
Now by “children” we understand works; and as by good children, good
works, so by evil, evil.
