<span id="ii.XXXVII.3"></span>

<span id="ii.XXXVII.3-p1"></span> *On the Third Part of the
Psalm.* <span id="fr_898"></span>[899](#fn_898.md)

<span id="ii.XXXVII.3-p3"></span>1. “I have been young, and now am old;
yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread”
([Psa. 37.25](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#025.md)<span
id="ii.XXXVII.3-p3.1"></span>).

<span id="ii.XXXVII.3-p4"></span>If it is spoken but in the person of
one single individual, how long is the whole life of one man? And what
is there wonderful in the circumstance, that a single man, fixed in some
one part of the earth, should not, throughout the whole space of his
life, being so short as man’s life is, have ever seen “the righteous
forsaken, nor his seed begging bread,” although he may have advanced
from youth to age. It is not anything worthy of marvel; for it might
have happened, that before his lifetime there should have been some
“righteous man seeking bread;” it might have happened, that there had
been some one in some other part of the earth not where he himself was.
Hear too another thing, which makes an impression upon us. Any single
one among you (look you) who has now grown old, may perhaps, when,
looking back upon the past course of his life, he turns over in his
thoughts the persons whom he has known, not find any instance of a
righteous man begging bread, or of his seed begging bread, suggest
itself to him; but nevertheless he turns to the inspired Scriptures, and
finds that righteous Abraham was straitened, and suffered hunger in his
own country, and left that land for another; he finds too that the son
of the very same man, Isaac, removed to other countries in search of
bread, for the same cause of hunger. And how will it be true to say, “I
have never seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread”? And
if he finds this true in the duration of his own life, he finds it is
otherwise in the inspired writings, which are more trustworthy than
human life is.

<span id="ii.XXXVII.3-p5"></span>2. What are we to do then? Let us be
seconded by your pious attention, so that we may discern the purpose of
God in these verses of the Psalm, what it is He would have us understand
by them. For there is a fear, lest any unstable person, not capable of
understanding the Scriptures spiritually, should appeal to human
instances, and should observe the virtuous servants of God to be
sometimes in some necessity, and in want, so as to be compelled to beg
bread: should particularly call to mind the Apostle Paul, who says, “In
hunger and thirst; in cold and nakedness;” <span
id="fr_899"></span>[900](#fn_899.md) and should stumble thereat, saying to
himself, “Is that certainly true <span id="fr_900"></span>[901](#fn_900.md)
which I have been singing? Is that certainly true, which I have been
sounding forth in so devout a voice, standing in church? ‘I have never
seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.’” Lest he
should say in his heart, “Scripture deceives us;” and all his limbs
should be paralyzed to good works: and when those limbs within him,
those limbs of the inner man, shall have been paralyzed (which is the
more fearful paralysis), he should henceforth leave off from good works,
and say to himself, “Wherefore do I do good works? Wherefore do I break
my bread to the hungry, and clothe the naked, and take home to mine
house him who hath no shelter, <span id="fr_901"></span>[902](#fn_901.md)
putting faith in that which is written? ‘I have never seen the righteous
forsaken, nor his seed begging bread;’ whereas I see so many persons who
live virtuously, yet for the most part suffering from hunger. But if
perhaps I am in error in thinking the man who is living well, and the
man who is living ill, to be both of them living well, and if God knows
him to be otherwise; that is, knows him, whom I think just, to be
unjust, what am I to make of Abraham’s case, who is commended by
Scripture itself as a righteous person? What am I to make of the Apostle
Paul, who says, ‘Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of
Christ.’ <span id="fr_902"></span>[903](#fn_902.md) What? that I should
myself be in evils such as he endured, ‘In hunger and thirst, in cold
and nakedness’?” <span id="fr_903"></span>[904](#fn_903.md)

<span id="ii.XXXVII.3-p11"></span>3. Whilst therefore he thus thinks,
and whilst his limbs are paralyzed to the power of good works, can we,
my brethren, as it were, lift up the sick of the palsy; and, as it were,
“lay open the roof” of this Scripture, and let him down before the
Lord. <span id="fr_904"></span>[905](#fn_904.md) For you observe that it is
obscure. If obscure therefore, it is covered. And I behold a certain
patient paralytic in mind, and I see this roof, and am convinced that
Christ is concealed beneath the roof. Let me, as far as I am able, do
that which was praised in those who opened the roof, and let down the
sick of the palsy before Christ; that He might say unto him, “Son, be of
good cheer, thy sins be forgiven <span id="page_99">p. 99</span> <span
id="ii.XXXVII.3-Page_99"></span>thee.”  <span
id="fr_905"></span>[906](#fn_905.md) For it was so that He made the inner
man whole of his palsy, by loosing his sins, by binding fast his faith.…

<span id="ii.XXXVII.3-p14"></span>4. But who is “the righteous” man, who
“hath never been seen forsaken, nor his seed begging bread”? If you
understand what is meant by “bread,” you understand who is meant by him.
For the “bread” is the Word of God, which never departs from the
righteous man’s mouth.…See now if “holy meditation doth ‘keep thee’” in
the rumination of this bread, then “hast thou never seen the righteous
forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.”

<span id="ii.XXXVII.3-p15"></span>5. “He is always merciful, and
lendeth” ([Psa. 37.26](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#026.md)<span
id="ii.XXXVII.3-p15.1"></span>). “Fœneratur” is used in Latin indeed,
both for him who lendeth, and for him who borroweth. But in this passage
the meaning is more plain, if we express it by “fœnerat.” What matters
it to us, what the grammarians please to rule? It were better for us to
be guilty of a barbarism, so that ye understand, than that in our
propriety of speech ye be left unprovided. Therefore, that “righteous
man is all day merciful, and (fœnerat) lendeth.” Let not the lenders of
money on usury, however, rejoice. For we find it is a particular kind of
lender that is spoken of, as it was a particular kind of bread; that we
may, in all passages, “remove the roof,” and find our way to Christ. I
would not have you be lenders of money on usury; and I would not have
you be such for this reason, because God would not have you.…Whence does
it appear that God would not have it so? It is said in another place,
“He that putteth not out his money to usury.” <span
id="fr_906"></span>[907](#fn_906.md) And how detestable, odious, and
execrable a thing it is, I believe that even usurers themselves know.
Again, on the other hand, I myself, nay rather our God Himself bids thee
be an usurer, and says to thee, “Lend unto God.” If thou lendest to man,
hast thou hope? and shalt thou not have hope, if thou lendest to God? If
thou hast lent thy money on usury to man, that is, if thou hast given
the loan of thy money to one, from whom thou dost expect to receive
something more than thou hast given, not in money only, but anything,
whether it be wheat, or wine, or oil, or whatever else you please, if
you expect to receive more than you have given, you are an usurer, and
in this particular are not deserving of praise, but of censure. “What
then,” you say, “am I to do, that I may ‘lend’ profitably?” Consider
what the usurer does. He undoubtedly desires to give a less sum, and to
receive a larger; do thou this also; give thou a little, receive much.
See how thy principal grows, and increases! Give “things temporal,”
receive “things eternal:” give earth, receive heaven! And perhaps thou
wouldest say, “To whom shall I give them?” The self-same Lord, who bade
thee not lend on usury, comes forward as the Person to whom thou
shouldest lend on usury! Hear from Scripture in what way thou mayest
“lend unto the Lord.” “He that hath pity on the poor, lendeth unto the
Lord.” <span id="fr_907"></span>[908](#fn_907.md) For the Lord wanteth not
aught of thee. But thou hast one who needs somewhat of thee: thou
extendest it to him; he receives it. For the poor hath nothing to return
to thee, and yet he would himself fain requite thee, and finds nothing
wherewith to do it: all that remains in his power is the good-will that
desires to pray for thee. Now when the poor man prays for thee, he, as
it were, says unto God, “Lord, I have borrowed this; be Thou surety for
me.” Then, though you have no bond on the poor man to compel his
repayment, yet you have on a sponsible security. See, God from His own
Scriptures saith unto thee; “Give it, and fear not; I repay it. It is to
Me thou givest it.” In what way do those who make themselves sureties
for others, express themselves? What is it that they say? “I repay it: I
take it upon myself. It is to me you are giving it.” Do we then suppose
that God also says this, “I take it on Myself. It is unto me thou givest
it”? Assuredly, if Christ be God, of which there is no doubt, He hath
Himself said, “I was an hungred, and ye gave Me meat.” <span
id="fr_908"></span>[909](#fn_908.md) And when they said unto Him, “When saw
we Thee hungry?” <span id="fr_909"></span>[910](#fn_909.md) that He might
show Himself to be the Surety for the poor, that He answers for all His
members, that He is the Head, they the members, and that when the
members receive, the Head receiveth also; He says, “Inasmuch as ye have
done it to one of the least of these that belong to Me, ye have done it
unto Me.” <span id="fr_910"></span>[911](#fn_910.md) Come, thou covetous
usurer, consider what thou hast given; consider what thou art to
receive. Hadst thou given a small sum of money, and he to whom thou
hadst given it were to give thee for that small sum a great villa, worth
incomparably more money than thou hadst given, how great thanks wouldest
thou render, with how great joy wouldest thou be transported! Hear what
possession He to whom thou hast been lending bestows. “Come, ye blessed
of My Father, receive”  <span id="fr_911"></span>[912](#fn_911.md) —What?
The same that they have given? God forbid! What you gave were earthly
things, which, if you had not given them, would have become corrupted on
earth. For what could you have made of them, if you had not given them?
That which on earth would have been lost, has been preserved in heaven.
Therefore what we <span id="page_100">p. 100</span> <span
id="ii.XXXVII.3-Page_100"></span>are to receive is that which hath been
preserved. It is thy desert that hath been preserved, thy desert hath
been made thy treasure. For consider what it is that thou art to
receive. Receive—“the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of
the world.” On the other hand, what shall be their sentence, who would
not “lend”? “Go ye into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his
angels.” <span id="fr_912"></span>[913](#fn_912.md) And what is the kingdom
which we receive called? Consider what follows: “And these shall go into
everlasting burning; but the righteous into life eternal.” <span
id="fr_913"></span>[914](#fn_913.md) Make interest for this; purchase this.
Give your money on usury to earn this. You have Christ throned in
heaven, begging on earth. We have discovered in what way the righteous
lendeth. “He is alway merciful, and lendeth.”

<span id="ii.XXXVII.3-p24"></span>6. “And his seed is blessed.” Here too
let not any carnal notion suggest itself. We see many of the sons of the
righteous dying of hunger; in what sense then will his seed be blessed?
His seed is that which remains of him afterwards; that wherewith he
soweth here, and will hereafter reap. For the Apostle says, “Let us not
be weary in well-doing; for in due season we shall reap if we faint not.
As we have therefore time,” he says, “let us do good unto all
men.” <span id="fr_914"></span>[915](#fn_914.md) This is that “seed” of
thine which shall “be blessed.” You commit it to the earth, and gather
ever so much more; and dost thou lose it in committing it to Christ? See
it expressly termed “seed” by the Apostle, when he was speaking of alms.
For this he saith; “He which soweth sparingly, shall reap also
sparingly; and he which soweth in blessings, <span
id="fr_915"></span>[916](#fn_915.md) shall also reap in blessings.” <span
id="fr_916"></span>[917](#fn_916.md) …

<span id="ii.XXXVII.3-p28"></span>7. Observe therefore what follows, and
be not slothful. “Depart from evil, and do good” ([Psa.
37.27](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#027.md)<span
id="ii.XXXVII.3-p28.1"></span>). Do not think it to be enough for thee
to do, if thou dost not strip the man who is already clothed. For in not
stripping the man who is already clothed, thou hast indeed “departed
from evil:” but do not be barren, and wither. So choose not to strip the
man who is clothed already, as to clothe the naked. For this is to
“depart from evil, and to do good.” And you will say, “What advantage am
I to derive from it?” He to whom thou lendest has already assured thee
of what He will give thee. He will give thee everlasting life. Give to
Him, and fear not! Hear too what follows: “Depart from evil, and do
good, and dwell for evermore.” And think not when thou givest that no
one sees thee, or that God forsakes thee, when haply after thou hast
given to the poor, and some loss, or some sorrow for the property thou
hast lost, should follow, and thou shouldest say to thyself, “What hath
it profited me to have done good works? I believe God doth not love the
men who do good.” Whence comes that buzz, that subdued murmur among you,
except that those expressions are very common? Each one of you at this
present moment recognises these expressions, either in his own lips, or
on those of his friend. May God destroy them; may He root out the thorns
from His field; may He plant “the good seed,” and “the tree bearing
fruit”! For wherefore art thou afflicted, O man, that thou hast given
some things away to the poor, and hast lost certain other things? Seest
thou not that it is what thou hast not given, that thou hast lost?
Wherefore dost thou not attend to the voice of thy God? Where is thy
faith? wherefore is it so fast asleep? Wake it up in thy heart. Consider
what the Lord Himself said unto thee, while exhorting thee to good works
of this kind: “Provide yourselves bags which wax not old; a treasure in
the heavens that faileth not, where no thief approacheth.” <span
id="fr_917"></span>[918](#fn_917.md) Call this to mind therefore when you
are lamenting over a loss. Wherefore dost thou lament, thou fool of
little mind, or rather of unsound mind? Wherefore didst thou lose it,
except that thou didst not lend it to Me? Wherefore didst thou lose it?
Who has carried it off? Thou wilt answer, “A thief.” Was it not this,
that I forewarned thee of? that thou shouldest not lay it up where the
thief could approach? If then he who has lost anything, grieves, let him
grieve for this, that he did not lay it up there, whence it could not be
lost.

<span id="ii.XXXVII.3-p30"></span>8. “For the Lord loveth judgment, and
forsaketh not His Saints” ([Psa.
37.28](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#028.md)<span
id="ii.XXXVII.3-p30.1"></span>). When the Saints suffer affliction,
think not that God doth not judge, or doth not judge righteously. Will
He, who warns thee to judge righteously, Himself judge unrighteously? He
“loveth judgment, and forsaketh not His Saints.” But (think) how <span
id="fr_918"></span>[919](#fn_918.md) the “life” of the Saints is “hid with
Him,” in such a manner, that who now suffer trouble on earth, like trees
in the winter-time, having no fruit and leaves, when He, like a
newly-risen sun, shall have appeared, that which before was living in
their root, will show itself forth in fruits. He does then “love
judgment, and doth not forsake His Saints.”…

<span id="ii.XXXVII.3-p32"></span>9. “But the unrighteous shall be
punished; the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.” Just as the “seed of
the” other “shall be blessed,” so shall the “seed of the wicked be cut
off.” For the “seed” of the wicked is the works of the wicked. For
again, on the other hand, we <span id="page_101">p. 101</span> <span
id="ii.XXXVII.3-Page_101"></span>find the son of the wicked man flourish
in the world, and sometimes become righteous, and flourish in Christ. Be
careful therefore how thou takest it; that thou mayest remove the
covering, and make thy way to Christ. <span
id="fr_919"></span>[920](#fn_919.md) Do not take the text in a carnal
sense; for thou wilt be deceived. But “the seed of the wicked”—all the
works of the wicked—“will be cut off:” they shall have no fruit. For
they are effective indeed for a short time; afterwards they shall seek
for them, and shall not find the reward of that which they have wrought.
For it is the expression of those who lose what they have wrought, that
text which says, “What hath pride profited us, or what good hath riches
with our vaunting brought us? All those things are passed away like a
shadow.” <span id="fr_920"></span>[921](#fn_920.md) “The seed of the
wicked,” then, “shall be cut off.”

<span id="ii.XXXVII.3-p35"></span>10. “The righteous shall inherit the
land” ([Psa. 37.29](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#029.md)<span
id="ii.XXXVII.3-p35.1"></span>). Here again let not covetousness steal
on thee, nor promise thee some great estate; hope not to find there,
what you are commanded to despise in this world. That “land” in the
text, is a certain “land of the living,” the kingdom of the Saints.
Whence it is said: “Thou art my hope, my portion in the land of the
living.”  <span id="fr_921"></span>[922](#fn_921.md) For if thy life too is
the same life as that there spoken of, think what sort of “land” thou
art about to inherit. That is “the land of the living;” this the land of
those who are about to die: to receive again, when dead, those whom it
nourished when living. Such then as is that land, such shall the life
itself be also: if the life be for ever, “the land” also is to be thine
“for ever.” And how is “the land” to be thine “for ever”?

<span id="ii.XXXVII.3-p37"></span>“And they shall dwell therein” (it
says) “for ever.” It must therefore be another land, where “they are to
dwell therein for ever.” For of this land (of this earth) it is said,
“Heaven and earth shall pass away.” <span
id="fr_922"></span>[923](#fn_922.md)

<span id="ii.XXXVII.3-p39"></span>11. “The mouth of the righteous
speaketh wisdom” ([Psa. 37.30](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#030.md)<span
id="ii.XXXVII.3-p39.1"></span>). See here is that “bread.” Observe with
what satisfaction this righteous man feedeth upon it; how he turns
wisdom over and over in his mouth. “And his tongue talketh of judgment.”

<span id="ii.XXXVII.3-p40"></span>“The law of his God is in his heart”
([Psa. 37.31](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#031.md)<span
id="ii.XXXVII.3-p40.1"></span>). Lest haply thou shouldest think him to
have that on his lips, which he hath not in his heart, lest thou
shouldest reckon him among those of whom it is said, “This people honour
Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me.” <span
id="fr_923"></span>[924](#fn_923.md) And of what use is this to him?

<span id="ii.XXXVII.3-p42"></span>“And none of his steps shall slide.”
The “word of God in the heart” frees from the snare; the “word of God in
the heart” delivers from the evil way; “the word of God in the heart”
delivers from “the slippery place.” <span
id="fr_924"></span>[925](#fn_924.md) He is with thee, Whose word departeth
not from thee. Now what evil doth he suffer, whom God keepeth? Thou
settest a watchman in thy vineyard, and feelest secure from thieves; and
that watchman may sleep, and may himself fall, and may admit a thief.
But “He who keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.” <span
id="fr_925"></span>[926](#fn_925.md) “The law of his God is in his heart,
and none of his steps shall slide.” Let him therefore live free from
fear; let him live free from fear even in the midst of the wicked; free
from fear even in the midst of the ungodly. For what evil can the
ungodly or unrighteous man do to the righteous? Lo! see what follows.

<span id="ii.XXXVII.3-p45"></span>“The wicked watcheth the righteous,
and seeketh to slay him” ([Psa.
37.32](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#032.md)<span
id="ii.XXXVII.3-p45.1"></span>). For he says, what it was foretold in
the book of Wisdom that he should say, “He is grievous unto us, even to
behold; for his life is not like other men’s.” <span
id="fr_926"></span>[927](#fn_926.md) Therefore he “seeks to slay him.”
What? Doth the Lord, who keepeth him, who dwelleth with him, who
departeth not from his lips, from his heart, doth He forsake him? What
then becomes of what was said before: “And He forsaketh not His
Saints”? <span id="fr_927"></span>[928](#fn_927.md)

<span id="ii.XXXVII.3-p48"></span>12. “The wicked therefore watcheth the
righteous, and seeketh to slay him. But the Lord will not leave him in
his hands” ([Psa. 37.33](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#033.md)<span
id="ii.XXXVII.3-p48.1"></span>). Wherefore then did He leave the Martyrs
in the hands of the ungodly? Wherefore did they do unto them “whatsoever
they would”? <span id="fr_928"></span>[929](#fn_928.md) Some they slew with
the sword; some they crucified; some they delivered to the beasts; some
they burnt by fire; others they led about in chains, till wasted out by
a long protracted decay. Assuredly “the Lord forsaketh not His Saints.”
He will not “leave him in his hands.” Lastly, wherefore did He leave His
own Son in “the hands of the ungodly”? Here also, if thou wouldest have
all the limbs of thy inner man made strong, remove the covering of the
roof, and find thy way to the Lord. Hear what another Scripture,
foreseeing our Lord’s future suffering at the hands of the ungodly,
saith. What saith it? “The earth is given into the hands of the
wicked.” <span id="fr_929"></span>[930](#fn_929.md) What is meant by
“earth” being “given into the hands of the ungodly”? The delivering of
the flesh into the hands of the persecutors. But God did not leave “His
righteous One” <span id="fr_930"></span>[931](#fn_930.md) there: from the
flesh, which was taken captive, He leads forth the soul unconquered.…

<span id="ii.XXXVII.3-p52"></span>“The Lord will not leave him in his
hand, nor condemn him when there shall be judgment for him” ([Psa.
37.33](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#033.md)<span
id="ii.XXXVII.3-p52.1"></span>). Some copies have it, “and when He shall
judge him, there shall be judg<span id="page_102">p. 102</span> <span
id="ii.XXXVII.3-Page_102"></span>ment for him.” “For him,” however,
means when sentence is passed upon him. For we can express ourselves so
as to say to a person, “Judge for me,” i.e. “hear my cause.” When
therefore God shall begin to hear the cause of His righteous servant,
since “we must all” be presented “before the tribunal of Christ,” and
stand before it to receive every one “the things he hath done in this
body,” <span id="fr_931"></span>[932](#fn_931.md) whether good or evil,
when therefore he shall have come to that Judgment, He will not condemn
him; though he may seem to be condemned in this present life by man.
Even though the Proconsul may have passed sentence on Cyprian, <span
id="fr_932"></span>[933](#fn_932.md) yet the earthly seat of judgment is
one thing, the heavenly tribunal is another. From the inferior tribunal
he receives sentence of death; from the superior one a crown, “Nor will
He condemn him when there shall be judgment for him.”

<span id="ii.XXXVII.3-p55"></span>13. “Wait on the Lord” ([Psa.
37.34](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#034.md)<span
id="ii.XXXVII.3-p55.1"></span>). And while I am waiting upon Him, what
am I to do?—“and keep His ways.” And if I keep them, what am I to
receive? “And He shall exalt thee to inherit the land.” “What land”?
Once more let not any estate suggest itself to your mind:—the land of
which it is said, “Come, ye blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom
prepared for you from the foundation of the world.”  <span
id="fr_933"></span>[934](#fn_933.md) What of those who have troubled us, in
the midst of whom we have groaned, whose scandals we have patiently
endured, for whom, while they were raging against us, we have prayed in
vain? What will become of them? What follows? “When the wicked are cut
off, thou shall see it.”…

<span id="ii.XXXVII.3-p57"></span>“I have seen the ungodly lifted up on
high, and rising above the cedars of Libanus” ([Psa.
37.35](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#035.md)<span
id="ii.XXXVII.3-p57.1"></span>). And suppose him to be “lifted up on
high;” suppose him to be towering above the “rest;” what follows?

<span id="ii.XXXVII.3-p58"></span>“I passed by, and, lo, he was not! I
sought him, and his place could nowhere be found!” ([Psa.
37.36](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#036.md)<span
id="ii.XXXVII.3-p58.1"></span>). Why was he “no more, and his place
nowhere to be found”? Because thou hast “passed by.” But if thou art yet
carnally-minded, and that earthly prosperity appears to thee to be true
happiness, thou hast not yet “passed by” him; thou art either his
fellow, or thou art below him; go on, and pass him; and when thou hast
made progress, and hast passed by him, thou observest him by the eye of
faith; thou seest his end, thou sayest to thyself, “Lo! he who so
swelled before, is not!” just as if it were some smoke that thou wert
passing near to. For this too was said above in this very Psalm, “They
shall consume and fade away as the smoke.” <span

<span id="ii.XXXVII.3-p60"></span>14. “Keep innocency” ([Psa.
37.37](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#037.md)<span
id="ii.XXXVII.3-p60.1"></span>); keep it even as thou usedst to keep thy
purse, when thou wert covetous; even as thou usedst to hold fast that
purse, that it might not be snatched from thy grasp by the thief, even
so “keep innocency,” lest that be snatched from thy grasp by the devil.
Be that thy sure inheritance, of which the rich and the poor may both be
sure. “Keep innocency.” What doth it profit thee to gain gold, and to
lose innocence?

<span id="ii.XXXVII.3-p61"></span>“Keep innocency, and take heed unto
the thing which is right.” Keep thou thine eyes “right,” that thou
mayest see “the thing which is right;” not perverted, wherewith thou
lookest upon the wicked; not distorted, so that God should appear to
thee distorted and wrong, in that He favours the wicked, and afflicts
the faithful with persecutions. Dost thou not observe how distorted thy
vision is? Set right thine eyes, and “behold the thing that is right.”
What “thing that is right”? Take no heed of things present. And what
wilt thou see?

<span id="ii.XXXVII.3-p62"></span>“For there is a remainder for the man
that maketh peace.” <span id="fr_935"></span>[936](#fn_935.md) What is
meant by “there is a remainder”? When thou art dead, thou shalt not be
dead. This is the meaning of “there is a remainder.” He will still have
something remaining to him, even after this life, that is to say, that
“seed,” which “shall be blessed.” Whence our Lord saith, “He that
believeth on Me, though he die, yet shall he live;” <span
id="fr_936"></span>[937](#fn_936.md) —“seeing there is a remainder for the
man that maketh peace.”

<span id="ii.XXXVII.3-p65"></span>15. “But the transgressors shall be
destroyed in the self-same thing” <span
id="fr_937"></span>[938](#fn_937.md) ([Psa.
37.38](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#038.md)<span
id="ii.XXXVII.3-p66.1"></span>). What is meant by, “in the self-same
thing”? It means for ever: or all together in one and the same
destruction.

<span id="ii.XXXVII.3-p67"></span>“The remainder of the wicked shall be
cut off.” Now there is “(a remainder) for the man that maketh peace:”
they therefore who are not peace-makers <span
id="fr_938"></span>[939](#fn_938.md) are ungodly. For, “Blessed are the
peace-makers: for they shall be called the children of God.” <span
id="fr_939"></span>[940](#fn_939.md)

<span id="ii.XXXVII.3-p70"></span>16. “But the salvation of the
righteous is of the Lord, and He is their strength in the time of
trouble” ([Psa. 37.39](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#039.md)<span
id="ii.XXXVII.3-p70.1"></span>). “And the Lord shall help them, and
deliver them; He shall deliver them from the sinners” <span
id="fr_940"></span>[941](#fn_940.md) ([Psa.
37.40](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#040.md)<span
id="ii.XXXVII.3-p71.1"></span>). At present therefore let the righteous
bear with the sinner; let the wheat bear with the tares; let the grain
bear with the chaff: for the time of separation will come, and the good
seed shall be set apart from that which is to be consumed with
fire. <span id="fr_941"></span>[942](#fn_941.md) The one will be consigned
to the garner, the other to “everlasting burning;” for it was for <span
id="page_103">p. 103</span> <span id="ii.XXXVII.3-Page_103"></span>this
reason that the just and the unjust were at the first together; that the
one should lay a stumbling-block, <span
id="fr_942"></span>[943](#fn_942.md) that the other should be proved; that
afterwards the one should be condemned, the other receive a crown.…
