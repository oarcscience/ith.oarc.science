<span id="ii.LII-p1"></span> <span id="ii.LII-p1.1"></span><span
class="c20"><span id="ii.LII-p1.2"></span>Psalm LII. <span
id="fr_1881"></span>[1882](#fn_1881.md) </span>

<span id="ii.LII-p3"></span>1. The title of the Psalm hath: “At the end,
understanding of David, when there came Doeg the Edomite and told Saul,
David hath come into the house of Abimelech:” whereas we read that he
had come into the house of Achimelech. And it may chance that we do not
unreasonably suppose, that because of the similarity of a name and the
difference of one syllable, or rather of one letter, the titles have
been varied. In the manuscripts, however, of the Psalms, when we looked
into them, rather Abimelech we have found than Achimelech. And since in
another place thou hast a most evident Psalm, intimating not a
dissimilarity of name, but an utterly different name; when, for
instance, David changed his face before King Achish, not before king
Abimelech, and he sent him away, and he departed: and yet the title of
the Psalm is thus written, “When he changed his countenance in the
presence of Abimelech” <span id="fr_1882"></span>[1883](#fn_1882.md) —the
very change of name maketh us the rather intent upon a mystery, lest
thou shouldest pursue the quasi-facts of history, and despise the sacred
veilings.…

<span id="ii.LII-p5"></span>2. Observe ye two kinds of men; the one of
men labouring, the other of those among whom they labour: the one of men
thinking of earth, the other of heaven: the one of men weighing down
their heart unto the deep, the other of men with Angels their heart
conjoining: the one trusting in earthly things, wherein this world
aboundeth, the other confiding in heavenly things, which God, who lieth
not, hath promised. But mingled are these kinds of men. We see now the
citizen of Jerusalem, citizen of the kingdom of heaven, have some office
upon earth: to wit, one weareth purple, is a Magistrate, is Ædile, is
Proconsul, is Emperor, doth direct the earthly republic: but he hath his
heart above, if he is a Christian, if he is a believer, if he is godly,
if he is despising those things wherein he is, and trusteth in that
wherein he is not yet. Of which kind was that holy woman Esther, who,
though she was wife of a king, incurred the danger of interceding for
her countrymen: and when she was praying before God, where she could not
lie, in her prayer said, that her royal ornaments were to her but as the
cloth of a menstruous woman. <span id="fr_1883"></span>[1884](#fn_1883.md)
Despair we not then of the citizens of the kingdom of heaven, when we
see them engaged in any of Babylon’s matters, doing something earthly in
republic earthly: nor again let us forthwith congratulate all men that
we see doing matters heavenly; because even the sons of pestilence sit
sometimes in the seat of Moses, of whom is said, “What things they say,
do ye: but what things they do, do not: for they say, and do not.” <span
id="fr_1884"></span>[1885](#fn_1884.md) Those, amid earthly things, lift up
heart unto heaven, these, amid heavenly words, trail heart upon earth.
But there will come time of winnowing, when both are to be severed with
greatest diligence, in order that no grain may pass over unto the heap
of chaff that is to be burned, that not one single straw may pass over
to the mass that is to be stored in the barn. <span
id="fr_1885"></span>[1886](#fn_1885.md) So long as then now it is mingled,
hear we thence our voice, that is, voice of the citizens of the kingdom
of heaven (for to this we ought to aspire, to bear with evil men here,
rather than be borne with by good men): and let us conjoin ourselves to
this voice, both with ear and with tongue, and with heart and work.
Which if we shall have done, we are here speaking in those things which
we hear. Let us therefore speak first of the evil body of kingdom
earthly.

<span id="ii.LII-p9"></span>3. “Why doth he glory in malice that is
mighty?” ([Psa. 52.1](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#001.md)<span
id="ii.LII-p9.1"></span>). Observe, my brethren, the glorying of
malignity, the glorying of evil men. Where is glorying? “Why doth he
glory in malice that is mighty?” That is, he that in malice is mighty,
why doth he glory? There is need that a man be mighty, but in goodness,
not in malice. Is it any great thing to glory in malice? To build a
house doth belong to few men, any ignorant man you please can pull down.
To sow wheat, to dress the crop, to wait until it ripen, and in that
fruit on which one has laboured to rejoice, doth belong to few men: with
one spark any man you please can burn all the crop. To breed an infant,
when born to feed him, to educate, to bring him on to youth’s estate, is
a great task: to kill him in one moment of time any one you please is
able. Therefore those things which are done for destruction, <span
id="page_198">p. 198</span> <span id="ii.LII-Page_198"></span>are most
easily done. “He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord:” <span
id="fr_1886"></span>[1887](#fn_1886.md) he that glorieth, let him glory in
goodness. Thou gloriest, because thou art mighty in evil. What art thou
about to do, O mighty man, what art thou about to do, boasting thyself
much? Thou art about to kill a man: this thing also a scorpion, this
also one fever, this also a poisonous fungus can do. To this is thy
mightiness reduced, that it be made equal to a poisonous fungus? This
therefore do the good citizens of Jerusalem, who not in malice but in
goodness glory: firstly, that not in themselves, but in the Lord they
glory. Secondly, that those things which make for edification they
earnestly do, and do such things as are strong to abide: but things
which make for destruction they may do, for the discipline of men
advancing, not for the oppression of the innocent. To this mightiness
then that earthly body being compared, why may it not hear out of these
words, “Why doth he glory in malice that is mighty?”

<span id="ii.LII-p11"></span>4. “In iniquity the whole day upon
injustice hath thy tongue thought” ([Psa.
52.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#002)<span id="ii.LII-p11.1"></span>.md):
that is, in the whole of time, without weariness, without intermission,
without cessation. And when thou doest not, thou thinkest; so that when
anything of evil is away from thy hands, from thy heart it is not away;
either thou doest an evil thing, or while thou canst not do, thou sayest
an evil thing, that is, thou evil-speakest: or when not even this thou
canst do, thou willest and thinkest an evil thing. “The whole day,”
then, that is, without intermission. We expect punishment to this man.
Is he to himself a small punishment? Thou threatenest him: thou, when
thou threatenest him, wilt send him whither? Unto evil? Send him away
unto himself. In order that thou mayest vent much rage, thou art going
to give him into the power of beasts: unto himself he is worse than
beasts. For a beast can mangle his body: of himself he cannot leave his
heart whole. Within, against himself he doth rage of himself, and dost
thou from without seek for stripes? Nay, pray God for him, that he may
be set free from himself. Nevertheless in this Psalm, my brethren, there
is not a prayer for evil men, or against evil men, but a prophecy of
what is to result to evil men. Think not therefore that the Psalm of
ill-will saith anything: for it is said in the spirit of prophecy.

<span id="ii.LII-p12"></span>5. There followeth then what? All thy might
and all thy thought of iniquity all the day, and meditation of malignity
in thy tongue without intermission, hath performed what, done what? “As
with a sharp razor thou hast done deceit” ([Psa.
52.3](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#003)<span id="ii.LII-p12.1"></span>.md).
See what do evil men to Saints, they scrape their hair. What is it that
I have said? If there be such citizens of Jerusalem, that hear the voice
of their Lord, of their King, saying, “Fear not them which kill the
body, but are not able to kill the soul:” that hear the voice which but
now from the Gospel hath been read, “What doth it profit a man, if he
shall gain the whole world, and of himself make wreck:” <span
id="fr_1887"></span>[1888](#fn_1887.md) they despise all present good
things, and above all life itself. And what is Doeg’s razor to do to a
man on this earth meditating on the kingdom of heaven, and about to be
in the kingdom of heaven, having with him God, and about to abide with
God? What is that razor to do? Hair it is to scrape, it is to make a man
bald. And this belongeth to Christ, who in the Place of a Skull was
crucified. <span id="fr_1888"></span>[1889](#fn_1888.md) It maketh also the
son of Core, which is interpreted baldness. <span
id="fr_1889"></span>[1890](#fn_1889.md) For this hair signifieth a
superfluity of things temporal. Which hairs indeed are not made by God
superfluously on the body of men, but for a sort of ornament: yet
because without feeling they are cut off, they that cleave to the Lord
with their heart, so have these earthly things as they have hair. But
sometimes even something of good with “hair” is wrought, when thou
breakest bread to the hungry, the poor without roof thou bringest into
thy house; if thou shalt have seen one naked, thou coverest him: <span
id="fr_1890"></span>[1891](#fn_1890.md) lastly, the Martyrs themselves also
imitating the Lord, blood for the Church shedding, hearing that voice,
“As Christ laid down His life for us, so also ought we also to lay down
for the brethren,” <span id="fr_1891"></span>[1892](#fn_1891.md) in a
certain way with their hair did good to us, that is, with those things
which that razor can lop off or scrape. But that therefore even with the
very hair some good can be done, even that woman a sinner intimated,
who, when she had wept over the feet of the Lord, with her hair wiped
what with tears she wetted. <span id="fr_1892"></span>[1893](#fn_1892.md)
Signifying what? That when thou shalt have pitied any one, thou oughtest
to relieve him also if thou canst. For when thou hast pity, thou
sheddest as it were tears: when thou relievest, thou wipest with hair.
And if this to any one, how much more to the feet of the Lord. The feet
of the Lord are what? The holy Evangelists, whereof is said, “How
beautiful are the feet of them that tell of peace, that tell of good
things!” <span id="fr_1893"></span>[1894](#fn_1893.md) Therefore like a
razor let Doeg whet his tongue, let him whet deceit as much as he may:
he will take away superfluous temporal things; will he necessary things
everlasting?

<span id="ii.LII-p20"></span>6. “Thou hast loved malice above benignity”
([Psa. 52.4](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#004.md)<span
id="ii.LII-p20.1"></span>). Before thee was benignity; herself thou
shouldest have loved. For thou wast not going to expend anything, nor
wast thou going <span id="page_199">p. 199</span> <span
id="ii.LII-Page_199"></span>to fetch something to love by a distant
voyage. Benignity is before thee, iniquity before thee: compare and
choose. But perchance thou hast an eye wherewith thou seest malignity,
and hast no eye wherewith thou seest benignity. Woe to the iniquitous
heart. What is worse, it doth turn away itself, that it may not see what
it is able to see. For what of such hath been said in another place? “He
would not understand that he might do good.” <span
id="fr_1894"></span>[1895](#fn_1894.md) For it is not said, he could not:
but “he would not,” he saith, “understand that he might do good,” he
closed his eyes from present light. And what followeth? “Of iniquity he
hath meditated in his bed;” that is, in the inner secrecy of his heart.
Some reproach of this kind is heaped upon this Doeg the Edomite, a
malignant body, a motion of earth, not abiding, not heavenly. “Thou hast
loved malignity above benignity.” For wilt thou know how an evil man
doth see both, and the former he doth rather choose, from the other doth
turn himself away? Wherefore doth he cry out when he suffereth anything
unjustly? Wherefore doth he then exaggerate as much as he can the
iniquity, and praise benignity, censuring him that hath wrought in him
malignity above benignity? Be he then a rule to himself for seeing: out
of himself he shall be judged. Moreover, if he do what is written, “Thou
shalt love thy neighbour as thyself;”  <span
id="fr_1895"></span>[1896](#fn_1895.md) and, “Whatsoever good things ye
will that men should do unto you, these also do ye do unto them:” <span
id="fr_1896"></span>[1897](#fn_1896.md) at home he hath means of knowing,
because what on himself he will not have to be done, he ought not to do
to another. “Thou hast loved malice above benignity.” Iniquitously,
inordinately, perversely thou wouldest raise water above oil: <span
id="fr_1897"></span>[1898](#fn_1897.md) the water will be sunk, the oil
will remain above. Thou wouldest under darkness place a light: the
darkness will be put to flight, the light will remain. Above heaven thou
wouldest place earth, by its weight the earth will fall into its place.
Thou therefore wilt be sunk by loving malice above benignity. For never
will malice overcome benignity. “Thou hast loved malice above benignity:
iniquity more than to speak of equity.” Before thee is equity, before
thee is iniquity: one tongue thou hast, whither thou wilt thou turnest
it: wherefore then rather to iniquity and not to equity? Food of
bitterness dost thou not give to thy belly, and food of iniquity dost
thou give to thy malignant tongue? As thou choosest whereon to live, so
choose what thou mayest speak. Thou preferrest iniquity to equity, and
preferrest malice to benignity; thou indeed preferrest, but above what
can ever be but benignity and equity? But thou, by placing thyself in a
manner upon those things which it is necessary should go beneath, wilt
not make them to be above good things, but thou with them wilt be sunk
unto evil things.

<span id="ii.LII-p25"></span>7. Because of this there followeth in the
Psalm, “Thou hast loved all words of sinking under” ([Psa.
52.5](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#005)<span id="ii.LII-p25.1"></span>.md).
Rescue therefore thyself, if thou canst, from sinking under. From
shipwreck thou art fleeing, and dost embrace lead! If thou wilt not
sink, catch at a plank, be borne on wood, let the Cross carry thee
through. But now because thou art a Doeg the Edomite, a “motion,” and
“of earth,” thou doest what? “Thou hast loved all words of
sinking-under, a tongue deceitful.” This hath preceded, words of
sinking-under have followed a tongue deceitful. What is a tongue
deceitful? A minister of guile is a tongue deceitful, of men bearing one
thing in heart, another thing from mouth bringing forth. But in these is
overthrowing, in these sinking under.

<span id="ii.LII-p26"></span>8. “Wherefore God shall destroy thee at the
end” ([Psa. 52.6](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#006.md)<span
id="ii.LII-p26.1"></span>): though now thou seemest to flourish like
grass in the field before the heat of the sun. For, “All flesh is grass,
and the brightness of man as the bloom of grass: the grass hath
withered, and the bloom hath fallen down: but the word of the Lord
abideth for everlasting.” <span id="fr_1898"></span>[1899](#fn_1898.md)
Behold that to which thou mayest bind thyself, to what <span
id="fr_1899"></span>[1900](#fn_1899.md) “abideth for everlasting.” For if
to grass, and to the bloom of grass, thou shalt have bound thyself,
since the grass shall wither, and the bloom shall fall down, “God shall
destroy thee at the end:” and if not now, certainly at the end He shall
destroy, when that winnowing shall have come, and the heap of chaff from
the solid grain shall have been separated. <span
id="fr_1900"></span>[1901](#fn_1900.md) Is not the solid grain for the
barns, and the chaff for the fire? Shall not the whole of that Doeg
stand at the left hand, when the Lord is to say, “Go ye into fire
everlasting, which hath been prepared for the devil and his
angels”? <span id="fr_1901"></span>[1902](#fn_1901.md) Therefore “God shall
destroy at the end: shall pluck thee out, and shall remove thee from thy
dwelling.” Now then this Doeg the Edomite is in a dwelling: “But a
servant abideth not in the house for ever.” <span
id="fr_1902"></span>[1903](#fn_1902.md) Even he worketh something of good,
even if not with his doings, at least with the words of God, so that in
the Church, when he “seeketh his own,” <span
id="fr_1903"></span>[1904](#fn_1903.md) he would say, at least, those
things which are of Christ.

<span id="ii.LII-p33"></span>“But He shall remove thee from thy
dwelling.” “Verily, verily, I say unto you, they have received their
reward.” <span id="fr_1904"></span>[1905](#fn_1904.md) “And thy root from
the land of the living.” Therefore in the land of the living we ought to
have root. Be our root there. Out of sight is the root: fruits may be
seen, root cannot be seen. Our root is our love, our <span
id="page_200">p. 200</span> <span id="ii.LII-Page_200"></span>fruits are
our works: it is needful that thy works proceed from love, then is thy
root in the land of the living. Then shall be rooted up that Doeg, nor
any wise shall he be able there to abide, because neither more deeply
there hath he fixed a root: <span id="fr_1905"></span>[1906](#fn_1905.md)
but it shall be with him in like manner as it is with those seeds on the
rock, which even if a root they throw out, yet, because moisture they
have not, with the risen sun forthwith do wither. But, on the other
hand, they that fix a root more deeply, hear from the Apostle what? “I
bow my knees for you to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye may
be in love rooted and grounded.” And because there now is root, “That ye
may be able,” he saith, “to comprehend what is the height, and breadth,
and length, and depth: to know also the supereminent knowledge of the
love of Christ, that ye may be filled unto all the fulness of
God.” <span id="fr_1906"></span>[1907](#fn_1906.md) Of such fruits so great
a root is worthy, being so single, so budding, for buddings so deeply
grounded. But truly this man’s root shall be rooted up from the land of
the living.

<span id="ii.LII-p37"></span>9. “And the just shall see, and shall fear;
and over him they shall laugh” ([Psa.
52.7](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#007)<span id="ii.LII-p37.1"></span>.md).
Shall fear when? Shall laugh when? Let us therefore understand, and make
a distinction between those two times of fearing and laughing, which
have their several uses. For so long as we are in this world, not yet
must we laugh, lest hereafter we mourn. We have read what is reserved at
the end for this Doeg, we have read and because we understand and
believe, we see but fear. This, therefore, hath been said, “The just
shall see, and shall fear.” So long as we see what will result at the
end to evil men, wherefore do we fear? Because the Apostle hath said,
“In fear and trembling work out your own salvation:” <span
id="fr_1907"></span>[1908](#fn_1907.md) because it hath been said in a
Psalm, <span id="fr_1908"></span>[1909](#fn_1908.md) “Serve the Lord in
fear, and exult unto Him with trembling.” Wherefore “with fear”?
“Wherefore let him that thinketh himself to stand, see that he fall
not.” <span id="fr_1909"></span>[1910](#fn_1909.md) Wherefore “with
trembling”? Because he saith in another place: “Brethren, if a man shall
have been overtaken in any delinquency, ye that are spiritual instruct
such sort in the spirit of gentleness; heeding thyself, lest thou also
be tempted.” <span id="fr_1910"></span>[1911](#fn_1910.md) Therefore, the
just that are now, that live of faith, so see this Doeg, what to him is
to result, that nevertheless they fear also for themselves: for what
they are to-day, they know; what to-morrow they are to be, they know
not. Now, therefore, “The just shall see, and they shall fear.” But when
shall they laugh? When iniquity shall have passed over; when it shall
have flown over; as now to a great degree hath flown over the time
uncertain; when shall have been put to flight the darkness of this
world, wherein now we walk not but by the lamp of the Scriptures, and
therefore fear as though in night. For we walk by prophecy; whereof
saith the Apostle Peter, “We have a more sure prophetic word, to which
giving heed ye do well, as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the
day shine, and the day-star arise in your hearts.” <span
id="fr_1911"></span>[1912](#fn_1911.md) So long then as by a lamp we walk,
it is needful that with fear we should live. But when shall have come
our day, that is, the manifestation of Christ, whereof the same Apostle
saith, “When Christ shall have appeared, your life, then ye also shall
appear with Himself in glory,” <span
id="fr_1912"></span>[1913](#fn_1912.md) then the just shall laugh at that
Doeg.…

<span id="ii.LII-p44"></span>10. But what shall they then say that shall
laugh? “And over him they shall laugh; and shall say, Behold a man that
hath not set God for his helper” ([Psa.
52.8](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#008)<span id="ii.LII-p44.1"></span>.md).
See ye the body earthly! “As much as thou shalt have, so great shalt
thou be,” is a proverb of covetous men, of grasping men, of men
oppressing the innocent, of men seizing upon other men’s goods, of men
denying things entrusted to their care. Of what sort is this proverb?
“As much as thou shalt have, so great shalt thou be;” that is, as much
as thou shalt have had of money, as much as thou shalt have gotten, by
so much the more mighty shalt thou be. “Behold a man that hath not set
God for his helper, but hath trusted in the multitude of his riches.”
Let not a poor man, one perchance that is evil, say, I am not of this
body. For he hath heard the Prophet saying, “He hath trusted in the
multitude of his riches:” forthwith if he is poor, he heedeth his rags,
he hath observed near him perchance a rich man among the people of God
more richly apparelled, and he saith in his heart, Of this man he
speaketh; doth he speak of me? Do not thence except thyself, do not
separate thyself, unless thou shalt have seen and feared, in order that
thou mayest hereafter laugh. For what doth it profit thee, if thou dost
want means, and thou burnest with cupidity? When our Lord Jesus Christ
to that rich man that was grieved, and that was departing from Him, had
said, “Go, sell all that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt
have treasure in heaven, and come follow Me:” <span
id="fr_1913"></span>[1914](#fn_1913.md) and great hopelessness for rich men
foretold, so that He said, more easily could a camel pass through the
eye of a needle, than a rich man enter into the kingdom of Heaven, <span
id="fr_1914"></span>[1915](#fn_1914.md) were not forthwith the disciples
grieved, saying with themselves, “Who shall be able to be saved?”
Therefore when they were saying, “Who shall be able to be saved?” did
they think of the few rich men, did there escape them so great a
multitude of <span id="page_201">p. 201</span> <span
id="ii.LII-Page_201"></span>poor men? Could they not say to themselves,
If it is hard, aye an impossible thing, that rich men should enter into
the kingdom of heaven, as it is impossible that a camel should enter
through the eye of a needle, let all poor men enter into the kingdom of
heaven, be the rich alone shut out? For how few are the rich men? But of
poor men are thousands innumerable. For not the coats are we to look
upon in the kingdom of heaven; but for every one’s garment shall be
reckoned the effulgence of righteousness: there shall be therefore poor
men equal to Angels of God, clothed with the stoles of immortality, they
shall shine as the sun in the kingdom of their Father: what reason is
there for us about a few rich men to be concerned, or distressed? This
thought not the Apostles; but when the Lord had spoken this, “It is
easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich
man to enter into the kingdom of heaven:” they saying to themselves,
“Who shall be able to be saved,” meant what? Not means, but desires; for
they saw even poor men themselves, even if not having money, yet to have
covetousness. And that ye may know, that not money in a rich man, but
covetousness is condemned, attend to what I say; Thou observest that
rich man standing near thee, and perchance in him is money, and is not
covetousness; in thee is not money, and is covetousness. A poor man full
of sores, full of woe, licked by dogs, having no help, having no morsel,
not having perchance a mere garment, was borne by the Angels unto
Abraham’s bosom. <span id="fr_1915"></span>[1916](#fn_1915.md) Ho! being a
poor man, art thou glad now; for are even sores by thee to be desired?
Is not thy patrimony soundness? There is not in this Lazarus the merit
of poverty, but that of godliness. For thou seest who was borne up, thou
seest not whither he was borne up. Who was borne up by Angels? A poor
man, full of woe, full of sores. Whither was he borne up? Unto Abraham’s
bosom. Read the Scriptures, and thou shall find Abraham to have been a
rich man.  <span id="fr_1916"></span>[1917](#fn_1916.md) In order that thou
mayest know, that not riches are blamed; Abraham had much gold, silver,
cattle, household, was a rich man, and unto his bosom Lazarus, a poor
man, was borne up. Unto bosom of rich man, poor man: are not rather both
unto God rich men, both in cupidity poor men?…

<span id="ii.LII-p49"></span>11. Therefore that man having been
condemned that “hath trusted in the multitude of his riches, and hath
prevailed in his vanity:” for what more vain, than he that thinketh coin
more to avail than God? Therefore that man having been condemned that
said, blessed of the people to whom these things are: thou that sayest,
“Blessed the people of whom is the Lord their own God,” dost think of
thyself what? dost hope for thyself what? “But I;” now at length hear
that body: “But I am like an olive, fruit-bearing in the house of God”
([Psa. 52.9](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#009.md)<span
id="ii.LII-p49.1"></span>). Not one man speaketh, but that olive
fruit-bearing, whence have been pruned the proud branches, and the
humble wild olive graffed in. <span id="fr_1917"></span>[1918](#fn_1917.md)
“Like an olive, fruit-bearing in the house of God, I have trusted in the
mercy of God.” He did what? “In the multitude of his riches:” therefore
his root shall be plucked out from the land of the living. “But I,”
because “like an olive, fruit-bearing in the house of God,” the root
whereof is nourished, is not rooted out, “have trusted in the mercy of
God.” But perchance now? For even herein men err sometimes. God indeed
they worship, and are not now like to that Doeg: but though on God they
rely, it is for temporal things nevertheless; so that they say to
themselves, I worship my God, who will make me rich upon earth, who to
me will give sons, who to me will give a wife. Such things indeed giveth
none but God, but God would not have Himself for the sake of such things
to be loved. For to this end oftentimes those things He giveth even to
evil men, in order that some other thing good men of Him may learn to
seek. In what manner then sayest thou, “I have trusted in the mercy of
God”? Perchance for obtaining temporal things? Nay but, “For everlasting
and world without end.” The expression, “For everlasting,” he willed to
repeat by adding, “world without end,” in order that by there repeating
he might affirm how rooted he was in the love of the kingdom of heaven,
and in the hope of everlasting felicity.

<span id="ii.LII-p51"></span>12. “I will confess to Thee for ever,
because Thou hast done” ([Psa.
52.10](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#010)<span id="ii.LII-p51.1"></span>.md).
“Hast done what?” Doeg Thou hast condemned, David Thou hast crowned. “I
will confess to Thee for ever, because Thou hast done.” Great
confession, “Because thou hast done”! “Hast done” what? except these
very things which above have been spoken of, that like an olive
fruit-bearing in the house of God, I should trust in the mercy of God
for everlasting and world without end? Thou hast done: an ungodly man
cannot justify himself. But who is He that justifieth? “Believing,” he
saith, “on Him” that justifieth “the ungodly.” <span
id="fr_1918"></span>[1919](#fn_1918.md) “For what hast thou which thou hast
not received? But if thou hast received, why dost thou glory as if thou
hast not received, as if of thyself thou hast?” <span
id="fr_1919"></span>[1920](#fn_1919.md) Be it far from me that I should so
glory, saith he, that is opposed against Doeg, that beareth with Doeg
upon earth, until he remove from his dwelling, and be rooted up from the
land of the living. I glory not as if I have not received, but in God I
glory. “And <span id="page_202">p. 202</span> <span
id="ii.LII-Page_202"></span>I will confess to Thee because Thou hast
done,” that is, because Thou hast done not according to my merits, but
according to Thy mercy. But I have done what? If thou recollectest,
“Before, I was a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious.” But thou,
what hast thou done? “But mercy I have obtained, because ignorant I did
it.” <span id="fr_1920"></span>[1921](#fn_1920.md) “I will confess to Thee
for ever, because Thou hast done.”

<span id="ii.LII-p55"></span>13. “And I will look for Thy name, for it
is pleasant.” Bitter is the world, but Thy name is pleasant. Even if
certain sweet things are in the world, yet with bitterness they are
digested. Thy name is preferred, not only for greatness but also for
pleasantness. “For unjust men have told to me their delights, but it is
not as Thy law, O Lord.” <span id="fr_1921"></span>[1922](#fn_1921.md) For
if there were nothing sweet to the Martyrs, they would not have suffered
with equanimity so great bitterness of tribulations. Their bitterness by
any one was experienced, their sweetness easily could no one taste. The
name of God therefore is pleasant to men loving God above all
pleasantnesses. “I will look for Thy name, for it is pleasant.” And to
what dost Thou prove that it is pleasant? Give me a palate to which it
is pleasant. Praise honey as much as thou art able, exaggerate the
sweetness thereof with what words thou shalt have the power: a man
knowing not what honey is, unless he shall have tasted, what thou sayest
knoweth not. Therefore the rather to the proof the Psalm inviting thee
saith what? “Taste and see that sweet is the Lord.” <span
id="fr_1922"></span>[1923](#fn_1922.md) Taste thou wilt not, and thou
sayest, Is it pleasant? What is pleasant? If thou hast tasted, in thy
fruit be it found, not in words alone, as it were only in leaves, lest
by the curse of the Lord, to wither like that fig-tree <span
id="fr_1923"></span>[1924](#fn_1923.md) thou shouldest deserve. “Taste,” he
saith, “and see, that sweet is the Lord.” Taste and see: then ye shall
see, if ye shall have tasted. But to a man not tasting, how provest
thou? By praising the pleasantness of the name of God, whatsoever things
thou shalt have said are words: something else is taste. The words of
His praise there hear even the ungodly, but none taste how sweet it is,
but the Saints. Further, a man discerning the sweetness of the name of
God, and wishing to unfold and wishing to show the same, and not finding
persons to whom he may unfold it; for to the Saints there is no need
that he show it, because they even of themselves taste and know, but the
ungodly cannot discern what they will not taste: doth, I say, what,
because of the sweetness of the name of God? He hath borne him forthwith
away from the crowds of the ungodly. “And I will look,” he saith, “for
Thy name, for it is pleasant, in the sight of Thy Saints.” Pleasant is
Thy name, but not in the sight of the ungodly. I know how sweet a thing
it is, but it is to them that have tasted.
