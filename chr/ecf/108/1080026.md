<span id="ii.XXII"></span>

<span id="ii.XXII-p1"></span> <span id="ii.XXII-p1.1"></span><span
class="c20"><span id="ii.XXII-p1.2"></span>Psalm XXII. <span
id="fr_593"></span>[594](#fn_593) </span>

<span id="ii.XXII-p3"></span>*To the end, for the taking up of the
morning, a psalm of David.* <span id="fr_594"></span>[595](#fn_594)

<span id="ii.XXII-p5"></span>1. “To the end,” for His own resurrection,
the Lord Jesus Christ Himself speaketh. <span
id="fr_595"></span>[596](#fn_595) For in the morning on the first day of
the week was His resurrection, whereby He was taken up, into eternal
life, “Over whom death shall have no more dominion.” <span
id="fr_596"></span>[597](#fn_596) Now what follows is spoken in the
person of The Crucified. For from the head of this Psalm are the words,
which He cried out, whilst hanging on the Cross, sustaining also the
person of the old man, whose mortality He bare. For our old man was
nailed together with Him to the Cross. <span
id="fr_597"></span>[598](#fn_597)

<span id="ii.XXII-p9"></span>2. “O God, my God, look upon me, why hast
Thou forsaken <span id="fr_598"></span>[599](#fn_598) me far from my
salvation?” ([Psa. 22.1](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#001)<span
id="ii.XXII-p10.4"></span>). Far removed from my salvation: for
“salvation is far from sinners.” <span id="fr_599"></span>[600](#fn_599)
“The words of my sins.” For these are not the words of righteousness,
but of my sins. For it is the old man nailed to the Cross that speaks,
ignorant even of the reason why God hath forsaken him: or else it may be
thus, The words of my sins are far from my salvation.

<span id="ii.XXII-p12"></span>3. “My God, I will cry unto Thee in the
daytime, and Thou wilt not hear ([Psa.
22.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#002)<span id="ii.XXII-p12.1"></span>).
My God, I will cry unto Thee in the prosperous circumstances of this
life, that they be not changed; and Thou wilt not hear, because I shall
cry unto Thee in the words of my sins. “And in the night-season, and not
to my folly.” And so in the adversities of this life will I cry to Thee
for prosperity; and in like manner Thou wilt not hear. And this Thou
doest not to my folly, but rather that I may have wisdom to know what
Thou wouldest have me cry for, not with the words of sins out of longing
for life temporal, but with the words of turning to Thee for life
eternal.

<span id="ii.XXII-p13"></span>4. “But Thou dwellest in the holy place, O
Thou praise of Israel” ([Psa.
22.3](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#003)<span id="ii.XXII-p13.1"></span>).
But Thou dwellest in the holy place, and therefore wilt not hear the
unclean words of sins. The “praise” of him that seeth Thee; not of him
who hath sought his own praise in tasting of the forbidden fruit, that
on the opening of his bodily eyes he should endeavour to hide himself
from Thy sight.

<span id="ii.XXII-p14"></span>5. “Our Fathers hoped in Thee.” All the
righteous, namely, who sought not their own praise, but Thine. “They
hoped in Thee, and Thou deliveredst them” ([Psa.
22.4](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#004)<span id="ii.XXII-p14.1"></span>).

<span id="ii.XXII-p15"></span>6. “They cried unto Thee, and were saved.”
They cried unto Thee, not in the words of sins, from which salvation is
far; and therefore were they saved. “They hoped in Thee, and were not
confounded” ([Psa. 22.5](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#005)<span
id="ii.XXII-p15.1"></span>). “They hoped in Thee,” and their hope did
not deceive them. For they placed it not in themselves.

<span id="ii.XXII-p16"></span>7. “But I am a worm, and no man” ([Psa.
22.6](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#006)<span id="ii.XXII-p16.1"></span>).
But I, speaking now not in the person of Adam, but I in My own person,
Jesus Christ, was born without human generation in the flesh, that I
might be as man beyond men; that so at least human pride might deign to
imitate My humility. “The scorn of men, and outcast of the people.” In
which humility I was made the scorn of men, so as that it should be
said, as a reproachful railing, “Be thou His disciple:” <span
id="fr_600"></span>[601](#fn_600) and that the people despise Me.

<span id="ii.XXII-p18"></span>8. “All that saw Me laughed Me to scorn”
([Psa. 22.7](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#007)<span
id="ii.XXII-p18.1"></span>). All that saw Me derided Me. “And spake with
the lips, and shook the head.” <span id="fr_601"></span>[602](#fn_601)
And they spoke, not with the heart, but with the lips.

<span id="ii.XXII-p20"></span>9. For they shook their head in derision,
saying, “He trusted in the Lord, let Him deliver Him:” <span
id="fr_602"></span>[603](#fn_602) “let Him save Him, since He desireth
Him” ([Psa. 22.8](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#008)<span
id="ii.XXII-p21.2"></span>). These were their words; but they were
spoken “with the lips.”

<span id="ii.XXII-p22"></span>10. “Since Thou art He who drew Me out of
the womb” ([Psa. 22.9](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#009)<span
id="ii.XXII-p22.1"></span>). Since Thou art He who drew Me, not only out
of that Virgin womb (for this is the law of all men’s birth, that they
be drawn out of the womb), but also out of the womb of the Jewish
nation; by the darkness whereof he is covered, and not yet born into the
light of Christ, whosoever places his salvation in the carnal observance
of the Sabbath, and of circumcision, and the like. “My hope from My
<span id="page_59">p. 59</span> <span
id="ii.XXII-Page_59"></span>mother’s breasts.” “My hope,” O God, not
from the time when I began to be fed by the milk of the Virgin’s
breasts; for it was even before; but from the breasts of the Synagogue,
as I have said, out of the womb, Thou hast drawn Me, that I should not
suck in the customs of the flesh.

<span id="ii.XXII-p23"></span>11. “I have been strengthened in Thee from
the womb” ([Psa. 22.10](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#010)<span
id="ii.XXII-p23.1"></span>). It is the womb of the Synagogue, which did
not carry Me, but threw Me out: but I fell not, for Thou heldest me.
“From My mother’s womb Thou art My God.” “From My mother’s womb: My
mother’s womb did not cause that, as a babe, I should be forgetful of
Thee.

<span id="ii.XXII-p24"></span>12. “Thou art My God,” “depart not from
Me; for trouble is hard at hand” ([Psa.
22.11](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#011)<span
id="ii.XXII-p24.1"></span>). Thou art, therefore, My God, depart not
from Me; for trouble is nigh unto Me; for it is in My body. “For there
is none to help.” For who helpeth, if Thou helpest not?

<span id="ii.XXII-p25"></span>13. “Many calves came about Me.” The
multitude of the wanton populace came about Me. “Fat bulls closed Me in”
([Psa. 22.12](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#012)<span
id="ii.XXII-p25.1"></span>). And their leaders, glad at My oppression,
“closed Me in.”

<span id="ii.XXII-p26"></span>14. “They opened their mouth upon Me”
([Psa. 22.13](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#013)<span
id="ii.XXII-p26.1"></span>). They opened their mouth upon Me, not out of
Thy Scripture, but of their own lusts. “As a ravening and roaring lion.”
As a lion, whose ravening is, that I was taken and led; and whose
roaring, “Crucify, Crucify.” <span id="fr_603"></span>[604](#fn_603)

<span id="ii.XXII-p28"></span>15. “I was poured out like water, and all
My bones were scattered” ([Psa.
22.14](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#014)<span
id="ii.XXII-p28.1"></span>). “I was poured out like water,” when My
persecutors fell: and through fear, the stays of My body, that is, the
Church, My disciples were scattered from Me. <span
id="fr_604"></span>[605](#fn_604) “My heart became as melting wax, in
the midst of my belly.” My wisdom, which was written of Me in the sacred
books, was, as if hard and shut up, not understood: but after that the
fire of My Passion was applied, it was, as if melted, manifested, and
entertained in the memory of My Church.

<span id="ii.XXII-p30"></span>16. “My strength dried up as a potsherd”
([Psa. 22.15](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#015)<span
id="ii.XXII-p30.1"></span>). My strength dried up by My Passion; not as
hay, but a potsherd, which is made stronger by fire. “And My tongue
cleaved to My jaws.” And they, through whom I was soon to speak, kept My
precepts in their hearts. “And Thou broughtest Me down to the dust of
death.” And to the ungodly appointed to death, whom the wind casteth
forth as dust from the face of the earth,  <span
id="fr_605"></span>[606](#fn_605) Thou broughtest Me down.

<span id="ii.XXII-p32"></span>17. “For many dogs came about Me” ([Psa.
22.16](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#016)<span
id="ii.XXII-p32.1"></span>). For many came about Me barking, not for
truth, but for custom. “The council of the malignant came about Me.” The
council of the malignant besieged Me. <span
id="fr_606"></span>[607](#fn_606) “They pierced My hands and feet.” They
pierced with nails My hands and feet.

<span id="ii.XXII-p34"></span>18. “They numbered distinctly all My
bones” ([Psa. 22.17](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#017)<span
id="ii.XXII-p34.1"></span>). They numbered distinctly all My bones,
while extended on the wood of the Cross. “Yea, these same regarded, and
beheld Me.” Yea, these same, that is, unchanged, regarded and beheld Me.

<span id="ii.XXII-p35"></span>19. “They divided My garments for
themselves, and cast the lot upon My vesture” <span
id="fr_607"></span>[608](#fn_607) ([Psa.
22.18](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#018)<span
id="ii.XXII-p36.1"></span>).

<span id="ii.XXII-p37"></span>20. “But Thou, O Lord, withhold not Thy
help far from Me” ([Psa. 22.19](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#019)<span
id="ii.XXII-p37.1"></span>). But Thou, O Lord, raise Me up again, not as
the rest of men, at the end of the world, but immediately. “Look to My
defence.” “Look,” that they in no wise hurt Me.

<span id="ii.XXII-p38"></span>21. “Deliver My soul from the sword.”
“Deliver My soul” from the tongue of dissension. “And My only One from
the hand of the dog” ([Psa. 22.20](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#020)<span
id="ii.XXII-p38.1"></span>). And from the power of the people, barking
after their custom, deliver My Church.

<span id="ii.XXII-p39"></span>22. “Save Me from the lion’s mouth:” save
Me from the mouth of the kingdom of this world: “and my humility from
the horns of the unicorns” <span id="fr_608"></span>[609](#fn_608)
([Psa. 22.21](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#021)<span
id="ii.XXII-p40.2"></span>). And from the loftiness of the proud,
exalting themselves to special pre-eminence, and enduring no partakers,
save My humility.

<span id="ii.XXII-p41"></span>23. “I will declare Thy name to My
brethren” <span id="fr_609"></span>[610](#fn_609) ([Psa.
22.22](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#022)<span
id="ii.XXII-p42.1"></span>). I will declare Thy name to the
humble, <span id="fr_610"></span>[611](#fn_610) and to My Brethren that
love one another as they have been beloved by Me. <span
id="fr_611"></span>[612](#fn_611) “In the midst of the Church will I
sing of Thee.” In the midst of the Church will I with rejoicing preach
Thee.

<span id="ii.XXII-p45"></span>24. “Ye that fear the Lord, praise Him.”
“Ye that fear the Lord,” seek not your own praise, but “praise Him.”
“All ye seed of Jacob, magnify Him” ([Psa.
22.23](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#023)<span
id="ii.XXII-p45.1"></span>). All ye seed of him whom the elder shall
serve, magnify Him.

<span id="ii.XXII-p46"></span>25. “Let all the seed of Israel fear Him.”
Let all who have been born to a new life, and restored to the vision of
God “fear Him.” “Since He hath not despised, nor disregarded the prayer
of the poor man” ([Psa. 22.24](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#024)<span
id="ii.XXII-p46.1"></span>). Since He hath not despised the prayer, not
of him who, crying unto God in the words of sins was loath to overpass a
vain life, but the prayer of the poor man, not swollen up with
transitory pomps. “Nor hath He turned away His face <span
id="page_60">p. 60</span> <span id="ii.XXII-Page_60"></span>from Me.” As
from him who said, I will cry unto Thee, but Thou wilt not hear. “And
when I cried unto Him He heard Me.”

<span id="ii.XXII-p47"></span>26. “With Thee is My praise” ([Psa.
22.25](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#025)<span
id="ii.XXII-p47.1"></span>). For I seek not Mine own praise, <span
id="fr_612"></span>[613](#fn_612) for Thou art My praise, who dwellest
in the holy place; and, praise of Israel, Thou hearest The Holy One now
beseeching Thee. “In the great Church I will confess Thee.” In the
Church of the whole world “I will confess Thee.” “I will offer My vows
in the sight of them that fear Him.” I will offer the sacraments of My
Body and Blood in the sight of them that fear Him.

<span id="ii.XXII-p49"></span>27. “The poor shall eat, and be filled”
([Psa. 22.26](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#026)<span
id="ii.XXII-p49.1"></span>). The humble and the despisers of the world
shall eat, and imitate Me. For so they will neither desire this world’s
abundance, nor fear its want. “And they shall praise the Lord, who seek
Him.” For the praise of the Lord is the pouring out of that fulness.
“Their hearts shall live for ever and ever.” For that food is the food
of the heart.

<span id="ii.XXII-p50"></span>28. “All the borders of the earth shall
remember themselves, and be turned to the Lord” ([Psa.
22.27](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#027)<span
id="ii.XXII-p50.1"></span>). They shall remember themselves: for, by the
Gentiles, born in death and bent on outward things, God had been
forgotten; and then shall all the borders of the earth be turned to the
Lord. “And all the kindreds of the nations shall worship in His sight.”
And all the kindreds of the nations shall worship in their own
consciences.

<span id="ii.XXII-p51"></span>29. “For the kingdom is the Lord’s, and He
shall rule over the nations” ([Psa.
22.28](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#028)<span
id="ii.XXII-p51.1"></span>). For the kingdom is the Lord’s, not proud
men’s: and He shall rule over the nations.

<span id="ii.XXII-p52"></span>30. “All the rich of the earth have eaten,
and worshipped” <span id="fr_613"></span>[614](#fn_613) ([Psa.
22.29](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#029)<span
id="ii.XXII-p53.1"></span>). The rich of the earth too have eaten the
Body of their Lord’s humiliation, and though they have not, as the poor,
been filled even to imitation, yet they have worshipped. “In His sight
shall fall all that descend to earth.” For He alone seeth how all they
fall, who abandoning a heavenly conversation, make choice, on earth, to
appear happy to men, who see not their fall.

<span id="ii.XXII-p54"></span>31. “And My Soul shall live to Him.” And
My Soul, which in the contempt of this world seems to men as it were to
die, shall live, not to itself, but to Him. “And My seed shall serve
Him” ([Psa. 22.30](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#030)<span
id="ii.XXII-p54.1"></span>). And My deeds, or they who through Me
believe on Him, shall serve Him.

<span id="ii.XXII-p55"></span>32. “The generation to come shall be
declared to the Lord” ([Psa.
22.31](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#031)<span
id="ii.XXII-p55.1"></span>). The generation of the New Testament shall
be declared to the honour of the Lord. “And the heavens shall declare
His righteousness.” And the Evangelists shall declare His righteousness.
“To a people that shall be born, whom the Lord hath made.” To a people
that shall be born to the Lord through faith.
