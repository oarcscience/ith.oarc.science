<span id="ii.CXIX.ix"></span>

<span id="ii.CXIX.ix-p1"></span> *<span class="c2"><span
id="ii.CXIX.ix-p1.1"></span>Teth.</span>*

<span id="ii.CXIX.ix-p2"></span>62. “Thou hast dealt in sweetness with
Thy servant: according unto Thy word;” or rather, “according unto Thine
utterance” ([Psa. 119.65](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#065)<span
id="ii.CXIX.ix-p2.1"></span>). The Greek word <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.CXIX.ix-p2.2"></span>χρηστότης</span> hath been variously
rendered by our translators by the words “sweetness” and “goodness.” But
since sweetness may exist also in evil, since all unlawful and unclean
things afford pleasure, and it may also exist in that carnal pleasure
which is permitted; we ought to understand the word “sweetness,” which
the Greeks termed <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.CXIX.ix-p2.3"></span>χρηστότης</span>, of spiritual blessings:
for on this account our translators have preferred to term it
“goodness.” I think therefore that nothing else is meant by the words,
“Thou hast dealt in sweetness with Thy servant,” than this, Thou hast
made me feel delight in that which is good. For when that which is good
delighteth, it is a great gift of God. But when the good work which the
law commandeth is done from a fear of punishment, not from a delight in
righteousness, when God is dreaded, not loved; it is the act of a slave,
not of a freeman. <span id="fr_5216"></span>[5217](#fn_5216)

<span id="ii.CXIX.ix-p4"></span>63. “O learn me sweetness, and
understanding, and knowledge,” he saith, “for I have believed Thy
commandments” ([Psa. 119.66](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#066)<span
id="ii.CXIX.ix-p4.1"></span>). He prayeth these things may be increased
and perfected. For they who said, “Lord, increase our faith,” <span
id="fr_5217"></span>[5218](#fn_5217) had faith. And as long as we live
in this world, these are the words of those who are making progress. But
he addeth, “understanding,” or, as most copies read, “discipline.” Now
the word discipline, for which the Greeks use <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.CXIX.ix-p5.2"></span>παιδεία</span>, is employed in Scripture,
where instruction through tribulation is to be understood: according to
the words, “Whom the Lord loveth He disciplineth, and scourgeth every
son whom He receiveth.”  <span id="fr_5218"></span>[5219](#fn_5218) In
the literature of the Church this is usually called discipline. For this
word, <span class="Greek"><span id="ii.CXIX.ix-p6.2"></span>
παιδεία</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.CXIX.ix-p6.3"></span>, <span id="fr_5219"></span>[5220](#fn_5219)
</span> is used in the Greek in the Epistle to the Hebrews, where the
Latin translator saith, “No *discipline* for the present seemeth to be
joyous, but grievous,” etc. <span id="fr_5220"></span>[5221](#fn_5220)
He therefore toward whom the Lord dealeth in sweetness, that is, he in
whom He mercifully inspires delight in that which is good, ought to pray
instantly, that this gift may be so increased unto him, that he may not
only despise all other delights in comparison with it, but also that he
may endure any amount of suf<span id="page_571">p. 571</span> <span
id="ii.CXIX.ix-Page_571"></span>ferings for its sake. Thus is discipline
healthfully added to sweetness. This discipline ought not to be desired,
and prayed for, for a small measure of grace and goodness, that is, holy
love; but for so great, as may not be extinguished by the weight of the
chastening:…so much in fact as to enable him to endure with the utmost
patience the discipline. In the third place is mentioned knowledge;
since, if knowledge in its greatness outstrips the increase of love, it
doth not edify, but “puffeth up.” <span
id="fr_5221"></span>[5222](#fn_5221) …

<span id="ii.CXIX.ix-p10"></span>64. But in that he saith, not, Give
unto me; but, “O learn me;” how is the sweetness taught, if it be not
given? Since many know what doth not delight them, and find no sweetness
in things of which they have knowledge. For sweetness cannot be learnt,
unless it please. Also discipline, which signifieth the tribulation
which chasteneth, is learnt by receiving; that is, not by hearing, or
reading, or thinking, but by feeling.…

<span id="ii.CXIX.ix-p11"></span>65. He addeth, “for I have believed Thy
commandments,” and herein we may justly enquire, why he said not, I
obeyed, rather than, I believed. For commandments are one thing,
promises another. We undertake to obey commandments, that we may deserve
to receive promises. We therefore believe promises, obey
commandments.…Teach me therefore sweetness by inspiring charity, teach
me discipline by giving patience, teach me knowledge by enlightening my
understanding: “for I have believed Thy commandments.” I have believed
that Thou who art God, and who givest unto man whence Thou mayest cause
him to do what Thou commandest, hast commanded these things.

<span id="ii.CXIX.ix-p12"></span>66. “Before I was humbled, I went
wrong; wherefore I have kept Thy word” ([Psa.
119.67](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#067)<span
id="ii.CXIX.ix-p12.1"></span>); or, as some have it more closely, “Thy
utterance,” that is, lest I should be humbled again. This is better
referred to that humiliation which took place in Adam, in whom the whole
human creature, as it were, being corrupted at the root, as it refused
to be subject to truth, “was made subject to vanity.”  <span
id="fr_5222"></span>[5223](#fn_5222) Which it was profitable to the
vessels of mercy to feel, that by throwing down pride, obedience might
be loved, and misery perish, never again to return.

<span id="ii.CXIX.ix-p14"></span>67. “Sweet art Thou, O Lord;” or, as
many have it, “Sweet art Thou, even Thou, O Lord” ([Psa.
119.68](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#068)<span
id="ii.CXIX.ix-p14.1"></span>). Some also, “Sweet art Thou,” or, “Good
art Thou:” as we have before treated of this word: “and in Thy sweetness
teach me Thy statutes.” He truly desireth to do the righteousnesses of
God, since he desireth to learn them in His sweetness from Him unto whom
he hath said, “Sweet art Thou, O Lord.”

<span id="ii.CXIX.ix-p15"></span>68. Next he saith, “The iniquity of the
proud hath been multiplied upon me” ([Psa.
119.69](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#069)<span
id="ii.CXIX.ix-p15.1"></span>): of those, that is, whom it profited not
that human nature was humbled after it went wrong. “But I will search
Thy commandments with my whole heart.” Howsoever, he saith, iniquity
shall abound, love shall not grow cold in me. <span
id="fr_5223"></span>[5224](#fn_5223) He, as it were, saith this, who in
His sweetness learneth the righteousnesses of God. For in proportion as
the commandments of Him who aideth us are the more sweet, so much the
more doth he who loveth Him search after them, that he may perform them
when known, and may learn them by doing them; because they are more
perfectly understood when they are performed.

<span id="ii.CXIX.ix-p17"></span>69. “Their heart is curdled as milk”
([Psa. 119.70](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#070)<span
id="ii.CXIX.ix-p17.1"></span>). Whose, save the proud, whose iniquity he
hath said hath been multiplied upon him? But he wisheth it to be
understood by this word, and in this passage, that their heart hath
become hard. It is used also in a good sense, <span
id="fr_5224"></span>[5225](#fn_5224) and is understood to mean, full of
grace: for this word, some have also interpreted “curdled.”…

<span id="ii.CXIX.ix-p19"></span>70. “It is good for me that Thou hast
humbled me: that I might learn Thy righteousnesses” ([Psa.
119.71](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#071)<span
id="ii.CXIX.ix-p19.1"></span>). He hath said something kindred to this
above. For by the fruit itself he showeth that it was a good thing for
him to be humbled; but in the former passage he hath stated the cause
also, in that he had felt beforehand that humiliation which resulted
from his punishment, when he went wrong. But in these words, “Wherefore
have I kept Thy word:” and again in these, “That I might learn Thy
righteousnesses:” he seemeth to me to have signified, that to know these
is the same thing as to keep them, to keep them the same thing as to
know them. For Christ knew what He reproved; and yet He reproved sin,
though it is said of Him that “He knew not sin.” <span
id="fr_5225"></span>[5226](#fn_5225) He knew therefore by a kind of
knowledge, and again He knew not by a kind of ignorance. Thus also many
learn the righteousnesses of God, and learn them not. For they know them
in a certain way; and, again do not know them from a kind of ignorance,
since they do them not. In this sense the Psalmist therefore is to be
understood to have said, “That I might learn Thy righteousnesses,”
meaning that kind of knowledge whereby they are performed.

<span id="ii.CXIX.ix-p21"></span>71. But that this is not gained, save
through love, wherein he who doeth them hath delight, on which account
it is said, “In Thy sweetness teach me Thy righteousnesses:” the
following verse showeth, wherein he saith, “The law of Thy mouth is
better unto me than thousands of gold and silver” ([Psa.
119.72](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#072)<span
id="ii.CXIX.ix-p21.1"></span>): so that love loveth the law of God more
than avarice loveth thousands of gold and silver.
