<span id="ii.CXXXIV-p1"></span> <span id="ii.CXXXIV-p1.1"></span><span
class="c20"><span id="ii.CXXXIV-p1.2"></span>Psalm CXXXIV. <span
id="fr_5644"></span>[5645](#fn_5644.md) </span>

<span id="ii.CXXXIV-p3"></span>1. “Behold, now, bless ye the Lord, all
ye servants of the Lord” ([Psa.
134.1](../../../bib/kjv/psa134.htm#001.md)<span
id="ii.CXXXIV-p3.1"></span>), “who stand in the house of the Lord, in
the courts of the house of our God” ([Psa.
134.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa134.htm#002.md)<span
id="ii.CXXXIV-p3.2"></span>). Why has he added, “in the courts”? Courts
mean the wider spaces of a house. He who stands in the courts is not
straitened, is not confined, in some fashion is enlarged. Remain in this
enlargement, and thou canst love thy enemy, because thou lovest not
things in which an enemy could straiten thee. How canst thou be
understood to stand in the courts? Stand in charity, and thou standest
in the courts. Breadth lies in charity, straitness in hatred.

<span id="ii.CXXXIV-p4"></span>2. “Lift up your hands by night in the
sanctuary, and bless the Lord” ([Psa.
134.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa134.htm#002.md)<span
id="ii.CXXXIV-p4.1"></span>). It is easy to bless by day. What is “by
day”? In prosperity. For night is a sad thing, day a cheerful. When it
is well with thee, thou dost bless the Lord. Thy son was sick, and he is
made whole, thou dost bless the Lord. Thy son was sick, perchance thou
hast sought an astrologer, a soothsayer, perchance a curse against the
Lord has come, not from thy tongue, but from thy deeds, from thy deeds
and thy life. Boast not, because thou blessest with thy tongue, if thou
cursest with thy life. Wherefore bless ye the Lord. When? By night. When
did Job bless? When it was a sad night. All was taken away which he
possessed; the children for whom his goods were stored were taken away.
How sad was his night! Let us however see whether he blesseth not in the
night. “The Lord gave, the Lord hath taken away; it is as the Lord
willed; blessed be the name of the Lord.” <span
id="fr_5645"></span>[5646](#fn_5645.md) And black was the night.…

<span id="ii.CXXXIV-p6"></span>3. “The Lord out of Zion bless thee, who
made heaven and earth” ([Psa.
134.3](../../../bib/kjv/psa134.htm#003.md)<span
id="ii.CXXXIV-p6.1"></span>). He exhorts many to bless, and Himself
blesseth one, because He maketh one out of many, since “it is good and
pleasant for brethren to dwell together in one.” <span
id="fr_5646"></span>[5647](#fn_5646.md) It is a plural number, brethren,
and yet singular, to dwell together in one. Let none of you say, It
cometh not to me. Knowest thou of whom he speaks, “the Lord bless thee
out of Zion.” He blessed one. Be one, <span
id="fr_5647"></span>[5648](#fn_5647.md) and the blessing cometh to thee.
