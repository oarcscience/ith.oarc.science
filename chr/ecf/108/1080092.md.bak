<span id="ii.LXXXI-p1"></span> <span id="ii.LXXXI-p1.1"></span><span
class="c20"><span id="ii.LXXXI-p1.2"></span>Psalm LXXXI. <span
id="fr_3777"></span>[3778](#fn_3777.md) </span>

<span id="ii.LXXXI-p3"></span>1. For a Title this Psalm hath, “Unto the
end for the presses, on the fifth of the Sabbath, a Psalm to Asaph
himself.” Into one title many mysteries are heaped together, still so
that the lintel of the Psalm indicates the things within. As we have to
speak of the presses, let no one expect that we shall speak of a vat, of
a press, of olive baskets; <span id="fr_3778"></span>[3779](#fn_3778.md)
because neither the Psalm hath this, and therefore it indicateth the
greater mystery.…

<span id="ii.LXXXI-p5"></span>No such thing did ye hear in this when it
was reading. Therefore take the presses for the mystery of the Church,
which is now transacting. In the presses we observe three things,
pressure, and of the pressure two things, one to be laid up, the other
to be thrown away. There takes place then in the press a treading, a
crushing, a weight: and with these the oil strains out secretly into the
vat, <span id="fr_3779"></span>[3780](#fn_3779.md) the lees run openly down
the streets.

<span id="ii.LXXXI-p7"></span>Look intently on this great spectacle. For
God ceaseth not to exhibit to us that which we may look upon with great
joy, nor is the madness of the Circus to be compared with this
spectacle. That belongeth to the lees, this to the oil. When therefore
ye hear the blasphemers babble impudently and say that distresses abound
in Christian times; for ye know that they love to say this: and it is an
old proverb, yet one that began from Christian times, “God gives no
rain; count it to the Christians!” <span
id="fr_3780"></span>[3781](#fn_3780.md) Although it was those of old that
said thus. But these now say also, “That God sends rain, count it to the
Christians! God sends no rain; we sow not. God sends rain; we reap not!”
And they wilfully make that an occasion of showing pride, which ought to
make them more earnest in supplication, choosing rather to blaspheme
than to pray.

<span id="ii.LXXXI-p9"></span>When therefore they talk of such things,
when they make such boasts, when they say these things, and say them in
defiance, not with fear, but with loftiness, let them not disturb you.
For suppose that pressures abound; be thou oil. Let the lees, black with
the darkness of ignorance, be insolent; and let it, as though cast away
in the streets, go gibing publicly: but do thou by thyself in thy heart,
where He who seeth in secret will requite thee, strain off into the vat.

<span id="ii.LXXXI-p10"></span>…To name some one thing about which even
they murmur who make them: How great plunderings, they say, are there in
our times, how great distresses of the innocent, how great robberies of
other men’s goods! Thus indeed thou takest notice of the lees, that
other men’s goods are seized; to the oil thou givest no heed, that to
the poor are given even men’s own. The old time had no such plunderers
of other men’s goods: but the old time had no such givers of their own
goods.…

<span id="ii.LXXXI-p11"></span>2. Wherefore also “on the fifth of the
sabbath”? <span id="fr_3781"></span>[3782](#fn_3781.md) What is this? Let
us go back to the first works of God, if perchance we may not there find
somewhat in which we may also understand a mystery. For the sabbath is
the seventh day, on which “God rested from all His works,” <span
id="fr_3782"></span>[3783](#fn_3782.md) intimating the great mystery of our
future resting from all our works. First of the sabbath then is called
that first day, which we also call the Lord’s day; second of the
sabbath, the second day;…and the sabbath itself the seventh day. See ye
therefore to whom this Psalm speaketh. For it seems to me that it
speaketh to the baptized. For on the fifth day God from the waters
created animals: on the fifth day, that <span id="page_391">p.
391</span> <span id="ii.LXXXI-Page_391"></span>is, on the “fifth of the
sabbath,” God said, “Let the waters bring forth creeping things of
living souls.” <span id="fr_3783"></span>[3784](#fn_3783.md) See ye,
therefore, ye in whom the waters have already brought forth creeping
things of living souls. For ye belong to the presses, and in you, whom
the waters have brought forth, one thing is strained out, another is
thrown away. For there are many that live not worthily of the baptism
which they have received. For how many that are baptized have chosen
rather to be filling the Circus than this Basilica! How many that are
baptized are either making booths in the streets, or complaining that
they are not made!

<span id="ii.LXXXI-p15"></span>But this Psalm, “For the presses,” and
“on the fifth of the sabbath,” is sung “unto Asaph.” Asaph was a certain
man called by this name, as Idithun, as Core, as other names that we
find in the titles of the Psalms: yet the interpretation of this name
intimates the mystery of a hidden truth. Asaph, in fact, in Latin is
interpreted “congregation.” Therefore, “For the presses, on the fifth of
the sabbath,” it is sung “unto Asaph,” that is, for a distinguishing
pressure, to the baptized, born again of water, the Psalm is sung to the
Lord’s congregation. We have read the title on the lintel, and have
understood what it means by these “presses.” Now if you please let us
see the very house of the composition, that is, the interior of the
press. Let us enter, look in, rejoice, fear, desire, avoid. For all
these things ye are to find in this inward house, that is, in the text
of the Psalm itself, when we shall have begun to read, and, with the
Lord’s help, to speak what He grants us.

<span id="ii.LXXXI-p16"></span>3. Behold yourselves, O Asaph,
congregation of the Lord. “Exult ye unto God our helper” ([Psa.
81.1](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#001.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXI-p16.1"></span>). Ye who are gathered together to-day, ye
are this day the congregation of the Lord, if indeed unto you the Psalm
is sung, “Exult ye unto God our helper.” Others exult unto the Circus,
ye unto God: others exult unto their deceiver, do ye exult unto your
helper: others exult unto their god their belly, do ye exult unto your
God your helper. “Jubilate unto the God of Jacob.” Because ye also
belong to Jacob: yea, ye are Jacob, the younger people to which the
elder is servant. <span id="fr_3784"></span>[3785](#fn_3784.md) “Jubilate
unto the God of Jacob.” Whatsoever ye cannot explain in words, ye do not
therefore forbear exulting: what ye shall be able to explain, cry out:
what ye cannot, jubilate. For from the abundance of joys, he that cannot
find words sufficient, useth to break out into jubilating; “Jubilate
unto the God of Jacob.”

<span id="ii.LXXXI-p18"></span>4. “Take the Psalm and give the tabret”
([Psa. 81.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#002.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXI-p18.1"></span>). Both “take,” and “give.” What is, “take”?
what, “give”? “Take the Psalm, and give the tabret.” The Apostle Paul
saith in a certain place, <span id="fr_3785"></span>[3786](#fn_3785.md)
reproving and grieving, that no one had communicated with him in the
matter of giving and receiving. What is, “in the matter of giving and
receiving,” but that which he hath openly set forth in another
place. <span id="fr_3786"></span>[3787](#fn_3786.md) “If we have sowed unto
you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we reap your carnal
things.” And it is true that a tabret, which is made of hide, belongs to
the flesh. The Psalm, therefore, is spiritual, the tabret, carnal.
Therefore, people of God, congregation of God, “take ye the Psalm, and
give the tabret:” take ye spiritual things, and give carnal. This also
is what at that blessed Martyr’s table <span
id="fr_3787"></span>[3788](#fn_3787.md) we exhorted you, that receiving
spiritual things ye should give carnal. For these which are built for
the time, are needful for receiving the bodies either of the living or
of the dead, but in time that is passing by. Shall we after God’s
judgment take up these buildings to Heaven? Yet without these we shall
not be able to do at this time the things which belong to the possessing
of Heaven. If therefore ye are eager in getting spiritual things, be ye
devout in expending carnal things. “Take the Psalm, and give the
tabret:” take our voice, return your hands.

<span id="ii.LXXXI-p22"></span>5. “The pleasant psaltery, <span
id="fr_3788"></span>[3789](#fn_3788.md) with the harp.” I remember that we
once intimated to your charity the difference of psaltery and
harp. <span id="fr_3789"></span>[3790](#fn_3789.md) …For heavenly is the
preaching of the word of God. But if we wait for heavenly things, let us
not be sluggish in working at earthly things; because, “the psaltery is
pleasant,” but, “with the harp.” The same is expressed in another way as
above, “Take the Psalm, and give the tabret:” here for “Psalm,” is put
“psaltery,” for “tabret,” “harp.” Of this, however, we are admonished,
that to the preaching of God’s word we make answer by bodily works.

<span id="ii.LXXXI-p25"></span>6. “Sound the trumpet” ([Psa.
81.3](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#003.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXI-p25.1"></span>). This is, Loudly and boldly preach, be not
affrighted! as the Prophet says in a certain place, “Cry out, and lift
up as with a trumpet thy voice.” <span
id="fr_3790"></span>[3791](#fn_3790.md) Sound the trumpet in the beginning
of the month of the trumpet.” It was ordered, that in the beginning of
the month there should be a sounding of the trumpet: and this even now
the Jews do in bodily sort, after the spirit they understand it not. For
the beginning of the month, is the new moon: the new moon, is the new
life. What is the new moon? “If any, then, is in Christ, <span
id="page_392">p. 392</span> <span id="ii.LXXXI-Page_392"></span>he is a
new creature.” <span id="fr_3791"></span>[3792](#fn_3791.md) What is,
“sound the trumpet in the beginning of the month of the trumpet”? With
all confidence preach ye the new life, fear not the noise of the old
life.

<span id="ii.LXXXI-p28"></span>7. “Because it is a commandment for
Israel, and a judgment for the God of Jacob” ([Psa.
81.4](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#004.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXI-p28.1"></span>). Where a commandment, there judgment. For,
“They that have sinned in the Law, by the Law shall be judged.” <span
id="fr_3792"></span>[3793](#fn_3792.md) And the very Giver of the
commandment, the Lord Christ, the Word made flesh, saith, “For judgment
I am come into the world, that they that see not may see, and they that
see may be made blind.” <span id="fr_3793"></span>[3794](#fn_3793.md) What
is, “That they that see not may see, they that see be made blind,” but
that the lowly be exalted, the proud thrown down? For not they that see
are to be made blind, but those who to themselves seem to see are to be
convicted of blindness. This is brought about in the mystery of the
press, that they who see may not see, and they that see be made blind.

<span id="ii.LXXXI-p31"></span>8. “A testimony in Joseph He made that”
([Psa. 81.5](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#005.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXI-p31.1"></span>). Look you, brethren, what is it? Joseph is
interpreted augmentation. Ye remember, ye know of Joseph sold into
Egypt: Joseph sold into Egypt <span id="fr_3794"></span>[3795](#fn_3794.md)
is Christ passing over to the Gentiles. There Joseph after tribulations
was exalted, and here Christ, after the suffering of the Martyrs, was
glorified. Thenceforth to Joseph the Gentiles rather belong, and
thenceforth augmentation; because, “Many are the children of her that
was desolate, rather than of her that hath the husband.” <span
id="fr_3795"></span>[3796](#fn_3795.md) “He made it, till he should go out
of the land of Egypt.” Observe that also here the “fifth of the sabbath”
is signified: when Joseph went out from the land of Egypt, that is, the
people multiplied through Joseph, he was caused to pass through the Red
Sea. Therefore then also the waters brought forth creeping things of
living souls. <span id="fr_3796"></span>[3797](#fn_3796.md) No other thing
was it that there in figure the passage of that people through the sea
foreshowed, than the passing of the Faithful through Baptism; the
apostle is witness: for “I would not have you ignorant, brethren,” he
said, “that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through
the sea, and were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the
sea.” <span id="fr_3797"></span>[3798](#fn_3797.md) Nothing else then the
passing through the sea did signify, but the Sacrament of the baptized;
nothing else the pursuing Egyptians, but the multitude of past sins. Ye
see most evident mysteries. The Egyptians press, they urge; so then sins
follow close, but no farther than to the water. Why then dost thou fear,
who hast not yet come, to come to the Baptism of Christ, to pass through
the Red Sea? What is “Red”? Consecrated with the Blood of the Lord. Why
fearest thou to come? The consciousness, perhaps, of some huge offences
goads and tortures in thee thy mind, and says to thee that it is so
great a thing thou hast committed, that thou mayest despair to have it
remitted thee. Fear lest there remain anything of thy sins, if there
lived any one of the Egyptians! <span
id="fr_3798"></span>[3799](#fn_3798.md)

<span id="ii.LXXXI-p37"></span>But when thou shalt have passed the Red
Sea, when thou shalt have been led forth out of thine offences “with a
mighty hand and with a strong arm,” <span
id="fr_3799"></span>[3800](#fn_3799.md) thou wilt perceive mysteries that
thou knowest not: since Joseph himself too, “when he came out of the
land of Egypt, heard a language which he knew not.” Thou shalt hear a
language which thou knowest not: which they that know now hear and
recognise, bearing witness and knowing. Thou shalt hear where thou
oughtest to have thy heart: <span id="fr_3800"></span>[3801](#fn_3800.md)
which just now when I said many understood and answered by acclamation,
the rest stood mute, because they have not heard the language which they
knew not. Let them hasten, then, let them pass over, let them learn.

<span id="ii.LXXXI-p40"></span>9. “He turned away from burdens his back”
([Psa. 81.6](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#006.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXI-p40.1"></span>). Who “turned away from burdens his back,”
but He that cried, “Come unto Me, all ye that labour and are heavy
laden”? <span id="fr_3801"></span>[3802](#fn_3801.md) In another manner
this same thing is signified. What the pursuit of the Egyptians did, the
same thing do the burdens of sins. As if thou shouldest say, From what
burdens? “His hands in the basket did serve.” By the basket are
signified servile works; to cleanse, to manure, to carry earth, is done
with a basket, <span id="fr_3802"></span>[3803](#fn_3802.md) such works are
servile: because “every one that doeth sin, is the slave of sin;” and
“if the Son shall have made you free, then will ye be free
indeed.” <span id="fr_3803"></span>[3804](#fn_3803.md) Justly also are the
rejected things of the world counted as baskets, but even baskets did
God fill with morsels; “Twelve baskets” <span
id="fr_3804"></span>[3805](#fn_3804.md) did He fill with morsels; because
“He chose the rejected things of this world to confound the things that
were mighty.” <span id="fr_3805"></span>[3806](#fn_3805.md) But also when
with the basket Joseph did serve, he then carried earth, because he did
make bricks. “His hands in the basket did serve.”

<span id="ii.LXXXI-p46"></span>10. “In tribulation thou didst call on
Me, and I delivered thee” ([Psa.
81.8](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#008.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXI-p46.1"></span>). Let each Christian conscience recognise
itself, if it have devoutly passed the Red Sea, <span
id="fr_3806"></span>[3807](#fn_3806.md) if with faith in believing and
observing it hath heard a strange language which it knew not, let it
recognise itself as having been heard in its tribulation. For that was a
great tribulation, to be weighed <span id="page_393">p. 393</span> <span
id="ii.LXXXI-Page_393"></span>down with loads of sins. How does the
conscience, lifted from the earth, rejoice. Lo, thou art baptized, thy
conscience which was yesterday overladen, to-day rejoiceth thee. Thou
hast been heard in tribulation, remember thy tribulation. Before thou
camest to the water, what anxiety didst thou bear on thee! what fastings
didst thou practise! what tribulations didst thou carry in thy heart!
what inward, pious, devout prayers! Slain are thine enemies; all thy
sins are blotted out. In tribulation thou didst call upon Me, and I
delivered thee.

<span id="ii.LXXXI-p48"></span>11. “I heard thee in the hidden part of
the tempest.” Not in a tempest of the sea, but in a tempest of the
heart. “I proved thee in the water of contradiction.” Truly, brethren,
truly, he that was heard in the hidden part of the tempest ought to be
proved in the water of contradiction. For when he hath believed, when he
hath been baptized, when he hath begun to go in the way of God, when he
hath striven to be strained into the vat, and hath drawn himself out
from the lees that run in the street, he will have many disturbers, many
insulters, many detractors, many discouragers, many that even threaten
where they can, that deter, that depress. This is all the “water of
contradiction.” I suppose there are some here to-day, for instance, I
think it likely there are some here whom their friends wished to hurry
away to the circus, and to I know not what triflings of this day’s
festivity: perchance they have brought those persons with them to
church. But whether they have brought those with them, or whether they
have by them not permitted themselves to be led away to the circus, in
the “water of contradiction” have they been tried. Do not then be
ashamed to proclaim what thou knowest, to defend even among blasphemers
what thou hast believed.…However much the bad that are aliens may rage,
O that our own bad people would not help them!

<span id="ii.LXXXI-p49"></span>Ye recollect what was said of Christ,
that He was thus born for “the fall of many, and the rising again of
many, and for a sign to be spoken against.” <span
id="fr_3807"></span>[3808](#fn_3807.md) We know, we see: the sign of the
Cross has been set up, and it has been spoken against. There has been
speaking against the glory of the Cross: but there was a title over the
Cross which was not to be corrupted. For there is a title in the
Psalm, <span id="fr_3808"></span>[3809](#fn_3808.md) “For the inscription
of the title, corrupt thou not.” It was a sign to be spoken against: for
the Jews said, “Make it not, King of the Jews, but make it, that He said
I am the King of the Jews.” <span id="fr_3809"></span>[3810](#fn_3809.md)
Conquered was the contradiction; it was answered, “What I have written,
I have written.”

<span id="ii.LXXXI-p53"></span>12. All this, from the beginning of the
Psalm up to this verse, we have heard of the oil of the press. What
remains is rather for grief and warning: for it belongs to the lees of
the press, even to the end; perchance also not without a meaning in the
interposition of the “Diapsalma.” But even this too is profitable to
hear, that he who sees himself already of the oil may rejoice; he that
is in danger of running among the lees may beware. To both give heed,
choose the one, fear the other.

<span id="ii.LXXXI-p54"></span>“Hear, O My people, and I will speak, and
will bear witness unto thee”([Psa.
81.8](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#008.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXI-p54.1"></span>). For it is not to a strange people, not to
a people that belongs not to the press: “Judge ye,” He saith, “between
Me and My vineyard.” <span id="fr_3810"></span>[3811](#fn_3810.md)

<span id="ii.LXXXI-p56"></span>13. “Israel, if thou shalt have heard Me,
there shall not be in thee any new god” ([Psa.
81.9](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#009.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXI-p56.1"></span>). A “new god” is one made for the time: but
our God is not new, but from eternity to eternity. And our Christ is
new, perchance, as Man, <span id="fr_3811"></span>[3812](#fn_3811.md) but
eternal God. For what before the beginning? And truly, “In the beginning
was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.” <span
id="fr_3812"></span>[3813](#fn_3812.md) And our Christ Himself is the Word
made flesh, that He might dwell in us. <span
id="fr_3813"></span>[3814](#fn_3813.md) Far be it, then, that there should
be in any one a new god. A new god is either a stone or a phantom. He is
not, saith one, a stone; I have a silver and a gold one. Justly did he
choose to name the very costly things, who said, “The idols of the
nations are silver and gold.” Great are they, because they are of gold
and silver; costly they are, shining they are; but yet, “Eyes they have,
and see not!” <span id="fr_3814"></span>[3815](#fn_3814.md) New are these
gods. What newer than a god out of a workshop? Yea, though those now old
ones spiders’ webs have covered over, they that are not eternal are new.
So much for the Pagans. <span id="fr_3815"></span>[3816](#fn_3815.md) …

<span id="ii.LXXXI-p62"></span>14. For if there be error in thee, Thou
wilt not worship a strange god. If thou think not of a false god, thou
wilt not worship a manufactured god: for “there will not” be in thee any
strange god. “For I am.” Why wouldest thou adore what is not? “For I am
the Lord thy God” ([Psa. 81.10](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#010.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXI-p62.1"></span>). Because “I am I that Am,” and indeed “I
Am” He saith, I that Am, over every creature: yet to thee what good have
I afforded in time? “Who brought thee out of the land of Egypt.” Not to
that people alone is it said. For we all were brought out of the land of
Egypt, we have all passed through the Red Sea; our enemies pursuing us
have perished in the water. Let us not be ungrateful to our God; let us
not forget God that abideth, and fabricate in ourselves a new god. “I,
who led thee out of the land of Egypt,” saith God. “Open wide <span
id="page_394">p. 394</span> <span id="ii.LXXXI-Page_394"></span>thy
mouth, and I will fill it.” Thou sufferest straitness in thyself because
of the new god set up in thy heart; break the vain image, cast down from
thy conscience the feigned idol: “open wide thy mouth,” in confessing,
in loving: “and I will fill it,” because with me is the fountain of
life.

<span id="ii.LXXXI-p63"></span>15. “And My people obeyed not My voice”
([Psa. 81.11](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#011.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXI-p63.1"></span>). For He would not speak these things except
to His own people. For, “we know that whatsoever things the Law saith,
it saith to them that are in the Law.” <span
id="fr_3816"></span>[3817](#fn_3816.md) “And Israel did not listen to Me.”
Who? To whom? Israel to Me. O ungrateful soul! Through Me the soul, by
Me the soul called, by Me brought back to hope, by Me washed from sins!
“And Israel did not listen to Me!” For they are baptized and pass
through the Red Sea: but on the way they murmur, gainsay, complain, are
stirred with seditions, ungrateful to Him who delivered them from
pursuing enemies, who leads through the dry land, through the desert,
yet with food and drink, with light by night and shade by day.

<span id="ii.LXXXI-p65"></span>16. “And I let them go according to the
affections of their heart” ([Psa.
81.12](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#012.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXI-p65.1"></span>). Behold the press: the orifices are open,
the lees run. “And I let them go,” not according to the healthfulness of
My commands; but, according to the affections of their heart: I gave
them up to themselves. The Apostle also saith, “God gave them up to the
desires of their own hearts.” <span id="fr_3817"></span>[3818](#fn_3817.md)
“I let them go according to the affection of their heart, they shall go
in their own affections.” There is what ye shudder at, if at least ye
are straining out into the hidden vats of the Lord, if at least ye have
conceived a hearty love for His storehouses, there is what ye shudder
at. Some stand up for the circus, some for the amphitheatre, some for
the booths in the streets some for the theatres, some for this, some for
that, some finally for their “new gods;” “they shall go in their own
affections.”

<span id="ii.LXXXI-p67"></span>17. “If My people would have heard Me, if
Israel would have walked in My ways” ([Psa.
81.13](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#013.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXI-p67.1"></span>). For perchance that Israel saith, Behold I
sin, it is manifest, I go after the affections of my own heart: but what
can I do? <span id="fr_3818"></span>[3819](#fn_3818.md) The devil doth
this. Demons do this. What is the devil? Who are the demons? Certainly
thine enemies. “Unto nothing all their enemies I would have brought
down; and on them that oppress them I would have sent forth My hand”
([Psa. 81.14](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#014.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXI-p68.1"></span>). But now what have they to do to complain
of enemies? Themselves are become the worse enemies. For how? What
followeth? Of enemies ye complain, yourselves, what are ye?

<span id="ii.LXXXI-p69"></span>18. “The enemies of God have lied unto
Him” ([Psa. 81.15](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#015.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXI-p69.1"></span>). Dost thou renounce? I renounce. <span
id="fr_3819"></span>[3820](#fn_3819.md) And he returns to what he
renounced. In fact, what things dost thou renounce, except bad deeds,
diabolical deeds, deeds to be condemned of God, thefts, plunderings,
perjuries, manslayings, adulteries, sacrileges, abominable rites,
curious arts. <span id="fr_3820"></span>[3821](#fn_3820.md) …

<span id="ii.LXXXI-p72"></span>19. If therefore all those works “shall
not possess the kingdom of God” (yea not the works, but “they that do
such things;” <span id="fr_3821"></span>[3822](#fn_3821.md) for such works
there shall be none in the fire: for they shall not, while burning in
that fire, be committing theft or adultery; but “they that do such
things shall not possess the kingdom of God”); they shall not therefore
be on the right hand, with those to whom it shall be said, “Come, ye
blessed of My Father, receive the kingdom:” because, “they that do such
things shall not possess the kingdom of God.” If therefore on the right
they shall not be, there remaineth not but that they must be on the
left. To those on the left what shall He say? “Go ye into eternal fire.”
Because, “their time shall be for ever.”

<span id="ii.LXXXI-p74"></span>20. Explain to us, then, saith one, how
those that build wood, hay, stubble, on the foundation, do not perish,
but “are saved, yet so as by fire”? An obscure question indeed that, but
as I am able I tell you briefly. Brethren, there are men altogether
despisers of this world, to whom nothing is pleasant that flows in the
course of time, they cling not by love to any earthly works, holy,
chaste, continent, just, perchance even selling all their goods and
distributing to the poor, or “possessing as though they possessed not,
and using this world as though not using it.” <span
id="fr_3822"></span>[3823](#fn_3822.md) But there are others who cling to
things allowed to infirmity with a degree of affection. He robs not
another of his estate, but so loves his own, that if he loses it he will
be disturbed. He does not covet another’s wife, but so clings to his
own, so cohabits with his own, as not therein to keep the measure
prescribed in the laws, for the sake of begetting children. He does not
take away other men’s things, but reclaims his own, and has a law-suit
with his brother. For to such it is said, “Now indeed there is
altogether a fault among you, because ye have law-suits with each
other.” <span id="fr_3823"></span>[3824](#fn_3823.md) But these very suits
he orders to be tried in the Church, not to be dragged into court, yet
he says they are faults. For a Christian contends for earthly things
more than becomes one to whom the kingdom of Heaven is promised. Not the
whole of his heart doth he raise upward, but some part of it he draggeth
on the earth.…Therefore if thou lovest thy possession, yet dost not for
its <span id="page_395">p. 395</span> <span
id="ii.LXXXI-Page_395"></span>sake commit violence, dost not for its
sake bear false witness, dost not for its sake commit manslaughter, dost
not for its sake swear falsely, dost not for its sake deny Christ: in
that thou wilt not for its sake do these things, thou hast Christ for a
foundation. But yet because thou lovest it, and art saddened if thou
losest it, upon the foundation thou hast placed, not gold, or silver, or
precious stones, but wood, hay, stubble. Saved therefore thou wilt be,
when that begins to burn which thou hast built, yet so as by fire. For
let no one on this foundation building adulteries, blasphemies,
sacrileges, idolatries, perjuries, think he shall be “saved through
fire,” as though they were the “wood, hay, stubble:” but he that
buildeth the love of earthly things on the foundation of the kingdom of
Heaven, that is upon Christ, his love of temporal things shall be
burned, and himself shall be saved through the right <span
id="fr_3824"></span>[3825](#fn_3824.md) foundation.

<span id="ii.LXXXI-p78"></span>21. …“And He fed them of the fat of
wheat, and from the rock with honey He satisfied them” ([Psa.
81.16](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#016.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXI-p78.1"></span>). In the wilderness from the rock He brought
forth water, <span id="fr_3825"></span>[3826](#fn_3825.md) not honey.
“Honey” is wisdom, holding the first place for sweetness among the
viands of the heart. How many enemies of the Lord, then, that lie unto
the Lord, are fed not only of the fat of wheat, but also from the rock
with honey, from the wisdom of Christ? How many are delighted with His
word, and with the knowledge of His sacraments, with the unfolding of
His parables, how many are delighted, how many applaud with clamour! And
this honey is not from any chance person, but “from the rock.” But “the
Rock was Christ.” <span id="fr_3826"></span>[3827](#fn_3826.md) How many,
then, are satisfied with that honey, cry out, and say, It is sweet; say,
Nothing better, nothing sweeter could be thought or said! and yet the
enemies of the Lord have lied unto Him. I like not to dwell any more on
matters of grief; although the Psalm endeth in terror to this purpose,
yet from the end of it, I pray you, let us return to the heading: “Exult
unto God our Helper.” Turned unto God. <span

adds: “Not lightly have your minds in the name of Christ been occupied
with the Divine exhibitions, and raised to earnestness, not only for
desiring some things, but also for shunning some things. These are the
exhibitions that are useful, healthful, building up, not destroying: yea
both destroying and building up, destroying ‘new gods,’ building up
faith in the true and eternal God. Also for to-morrow we invite your
love. To-morrow, they have, as we have heard, a sea in the theatre; let
us have a harbour in Christ. But since the day after to-morrow, that is,
the fourth of the week, we cannot meet at the ‘Table of Cyprian,’
because it is the festival of the holy Martyrs, to-morrow let us meet at
that Table.” See p. 391, *supra*.—C.\]
