<span id="ii.CXIX.vii"></span>

<span id="ii.CXIX.vii-p1"></span> *<span class="c2"><span
id="ii.CXIX.vii-p1.1"></span>Zain.</span>*

<span id="ii.CXIX.vii-p2"></span>50. “O remember Thy word unto Thy
servant, wherein Thou hast given me hope” ([Psa.
119.49](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#049)<span
id="ii.CXIX.vii-p2.1"></span>). Is forgetfulness incident to God, as it
is to man? Why then is it said unto Him, “O remember”? Although in other
passages of holy Scripture this very word is used, as, “Why hast Thou
forgotten me?” <span id="fr_5197"></span>[5198](#fn_5197) and,
“Wherefore forgettest Thou our misery?” <span
id="fr_5198"></span>[5199](#fn_5198) …These expressions are borrowed
from moral discourses on human affections; although God doth these
things according to a fixed dispensation, with no failing memory, nor
with an understanding obscured, nor with a will changed. When therefore
it is said unto Him, “O remember,” the desire of him who prayeth is
displayed, because he asketh for what was promised; God is not
admonished, as if the promise had escaped from His mind. “O remember,”
he saith, “Thy word unto Thy servant:” that is, fulfil Thy promise to
Thy servant. “Wherein Thou hast given me hope:” that is, in Thy Word,
since Thou hast promised, Thou hast caused me to hope.

<span id="ii.CXIX.vii-p5"></span>51. “The same is my comfort in my
humiliation” ([Psa. 119.50](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#050)<span
id="ii.CXIX.vii-p5.1"></span>). Namely, that hope which is given to the
humble, as the Scripture saith: “God resisteth the proud, but giveth
grace unto the humble.” <span id="fr_5199"></span>[5200](#fn_5199)
Whence also our Lord Himself saith with His own lips, “For whosoever
exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be
exalted.” <span id="fr_5200"></span>[5201](#fn_5200) We well understand
here that humiliation also, not whereby each man humbleth himself by
confessing his sins, and by not arrogating righteousness to himself; but
when each man is humbled by some tribulation or mortification which his
pride deserved; or when he is exercised and proved by endurance; <span
id="fr_5201"></span>[5202](#fn_5201) whence a little after this Psalm
saith, “Before I was troubled, I went wrong.”…And the Lord Jesus, when
He foretold that this humiliation would be brought upon His disciples by
their persecutors, did not leave them without a hope; but gave them one,
whereby they might find comfort, in these words: “In your patience shall
ye possess your souls;” and declared even of their very bodies, which
might be put to death by their enemies, and seemingly be utterly
annihilated, that not a hair of their heads should perish. <span
id="fr_5202"></span>[5203](#fn_5202) This hope was given to Christ’s
Body, that is, to the Church, that it might be a comfort to Her in her
humiliation.…This hope He gave in the prayer which He taught us, where
He enjoined us to say, “Lead us not into temptation:” <span
id="fr_5203"></span>[5204](#fn_5203) for He in a manner implicitly
promised that He would give to His disciples in their danger that which
He taught them to ask for in their prayers. And indeed this Psalm is
rather to be understood to speak of this hope: “For Thy word hath
quickened me.” Which they have rendered more closely who have put not
“word,” but “utterance.” For the Greek has <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.CXIX.vii-p10.2"></span>λόγιον</span>, which is “utterance;” not
<span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.CXIX.vii-p10.3"></span>λόγος</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.CXIX.vii-p10.4"></span>,</span> which is “word.”

<span id="ii.CXIX.vii-p11"></span>52. The next verse is, “The proud
dealt exceeding wickedly: yet have I not shrinked from Thy law” ([Psa.
119.51](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#051)<span
id="ii.CXIX.vii-p11.1"></span>). By the proud he wished to be understood
the persecutors of the pious; and he therefore added, “yet have I not
shrinked from Thy laws,” because the persecution of the proud attempted
to force him to do this. He saith that they dealt “exceeding wickedly,”
because they were not only wicked themselves, but even tried to make the
godly wicked. In this humiliation, that is, in this tribulation, that
hope comforted him which was given in the word of God, who promised aid,
that the faith <span id="page_569">p. 569</span> <span
id="ii.CXIX.vii-Page_569"></span>of the Martyrs might not faint; and who
by the presence of His Spirit gave strength to them in their toils, that
they might escape from the snare of the fowlers. <span
id="fr_5204"></span>[5205](#fn_5204) …

<span id="ii.CXIX.vii-p13"></span>53. “For I was mindful of Thy
judgments from the beginning of the world, O Lord, and received comfort”
([Psa. 119.52](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#052)<span
id="ii.CXIX.vii-p13.1"></span>); or, as other copies have it, “and I was
exhorted,” that is, received exhortation. For either might be rendered
for the Greek <span class="c34"><span
id="ii.CXIX.vii-p13.2"></span>pareklhqhn.</span> “From the beginning of
the world,” that is, from the birth of the human race, “I was mindful of
Thy judgments” upon the vessels of wrath, which are fitted unto
perdition: “and I received comfort,” since through these also hast Thou
shown the riches of Thy glory on the vessels of Thy mercy. <span
id="fr_5205"></span>[5206](#fn_5205)

<span id="ii.CXIX.vii-p15"></span>54. “Weariness hath held me; for the
ungodly that forsake Thy law” ([Psa.
119.53](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#053)<span
id="ii.CXIX.vii-p15.1"></span>). “Thy statutes have been my songs in the
house of my pilgrimage” ([Psa.
119.54](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#054)<span
id="ii.CXIX.vii-p15.2"></span>). This is the low estate, in the house of
mortality, of the man who sojourneth away from Paradise and the
Jerusalem above, whence one going down to Jericho fell among robbers;
but, in consequence of the deed of mercy which was done him by that
Samaritan, <span id="fr_5206"></span>[5207](#fn_5206) the statutes of
God became his song in the house of his pilgrimage; although he was
weary for the ungodly that forsook the law of God, since he was
compelled to converse with them for a season in this life, until the
floor be threshed. But these two verses may be adapted to the two
clauses of the preceding verse, respectively.

<span id="ii.CXIX.vii-p17"></span>55. “I have thought upon Thy Name, O
Lord, in the night-season, and have kept Thy law” ([Psa.
119.55](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#055)<span
id="ii.CXIX.vii-p17.1"></span>). Night is that low estate wherein is the
trouble of mortality; night is in the proud who deal exceeding wickedly;
night is the fear for the ungodly who forsake the law of the Lord; night
is, lastly, the house of this pilgrimage, “until the Lord come, and
bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the
counsels of the hearts, and then shall every man have praise of
God.” <span id="fr_5207"></span>[5208](#fn_5207) In this night,
therefore, man ought to remember the Name of the Lord; “So that he who
glorieth, may glory in the Lord.” <span
id="fr_5208"></span>[5209](#fn_5208)

<span id="ii.CXIX.vii-p20"></span>56. Considering this, he addeth, “This
was made unto me, because I sought out Thy righteousnesses” ([Psa.
119.56](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#056)<span
id="ii.CXIX.vii-p20.1"></span>). “Thy” righteousnesses, whereby Thou
dost justify the ungodly; not mine, which never make me godly, but
proud. For this man was not one of those who, “ignorant of God’s
righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness,
have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God.”  <span
id="fr_5209"></span>[5210](#fn_5209) Others have better interpreted
these righteousnesses, as those whereby men are justified for nought
through God’s grace, though by themselves they cannot be righteous,
“justifications.” <span id="fr_5210"></span>[5211](#fn_5210) But what
meaneth, “This was made unto me”? What is “This”? It is perhaps the law?
as he had said, “and I have kept Thy law;” to which he subjoins, “This
was made unto me,” meaning, “This was made my law.” We must therefore
enquire first what was thus made unto him, next in what manner, whatever
it may have been, was made unto him. “This,” he saith, “was made unto
me:” not “This law,” for the Greek, as I have said, refuseth this sense.
Perhaps then, “This night:” since the preceding sentence stands thus: “I
have thought upon Thy Name, O Lord, in the night-season:” and the next
words are, “This was made unto me:” since then it is not the law, it
must truly be the night which is thus spoken of. What then meaneth, “I
had the night-season: for I have sought out Thy righteousnesses”? Rather
light had come unto him than night, since he sought out the
righteousnesses of God. And it is thus rightly understood, “It was made
unto me,” as if it were said, It became night for my sake, that is, that
it might profit me. For that low estate of mortality is not absurdly
understood as night, where the hearts of mortals are hid to one another,
so that from such darkness innumerable and heavy temptations arise.…
