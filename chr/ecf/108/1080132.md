<span id="ii.CXIX.ii"></span>

<span id="ii.CXIX.ii-p1"></span> *<span class="c2"><span
id="ii.CXIX.ii-p1.1"></span>Beth.</span>*

<span id="ii.CXIX.ii-p2"></span>9. “Wherewithal shall a young man
correct his way? even by keeping Thy words” ([Psa.
119.9](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#009.md)<span
id="ii.CXIX.ii-p2.1"></span>). He questioneth himself, and answereth
himself. “Wherewithal?” So far it is a question: next cometh the answer,
“even by keeping Thy words.” But in this place the keeping of the words
of God, must be understood as the obeying His commandments in deed: for
they are kept in memory in vain, if they are not kept in life also. But
what is meant by “young man” here? For he might have said, wherewithal
shall any one (*homo*) correct his way? or, wherewithal shall a man
(*vir*) correct his way? which is usually put by the Scriptures in such
a way, that the whole human race is understood.…But in this passage he
saith neither any one, nor a man, but, “a young man.” Is then an old man
to be despaired of? or doth an old man correct his way by any other
means than by ruling himself after God’s word? Or is it perhaps an
admonition at what age we ought chiefly to correct our way; according to
what is elsewhere written, “My son, gather instruction from thy youth
up: so shalt thou find wisdom till thy gray hairs.” <span
id="fr_5137"></span>[5138](#fn_5137.md) There is another mode of
interpreting it, by recognising in the expression the younger son in the
Gospel, <span id="fr_5138"></span>[5139](#fn_5138.md) who returned to
himself, and said, “I will arise and go to my father.” <span
id="fr_5139"></span>[5140](#fn_5139.md) Wherewithal did he correct his way,
save by ruling himself after the words of God, which he desired as one
longing for his father’s bread.…

<span id="ii.CXIX.ii-p6"></span>10. “With my whole heart,” he saith,
“have I sought thee; O repel me not from Thy commandments” ([Psa.
119.10](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#010.md)<span
id="ii.CXIX.ii-p6.1"></span>). Behold, he prayeth that he may be aided
to keep the words of God, wherewith he had said that the young man
corrected his way. For this is the meaning of the words, “O repel me not
from Thy commandments:” for what is it to be repelled of God, save not
to be aided? For human infirmity is not equal to obeying His righteous
and exalted commandments, unless His love doth prevent <span
id="page_562">p. 562</span> <span id="ii.CXIX.ii-Page_562"></span>and
aid. But those whom He aideth not, these He is justly said to repel.…

<span id="ii.CXIX.ii-p7"></span>11. “Thy words have I hid within my
heart, that I may not sin against Thee” ([Psa.
119.11](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#011.md)<span
id="ii.CXIX.ii-p7.1"></span>). He at once sought the Divine aid, lest
the words of God might be hidden without fruit in his heart, unless
works of righteousness followed. For after saying this, he added,
“Blessed art Thou, O Lord, teach me Thy righteousnesses” ([Psa.
119.12](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#012.md)<span
id="ii.CXIX.ii-p7.2"></span>). “Teach me,” he saith, as they learn who
do them; not as they who merely remember them, that they may have
somewhat to speak of. Why then doth he say, “Teach me Thy
righteousnesses,” save because he wisheth to learn them by deeds, not by
speaking or retaining them in his memory? Since then, as it is read in
another Psalm, “He shall give blessing, who gave the law;” <span
id="fr_5140"></span>[5141](#fn_5140.md) therefore, “Blessed art Thou, O
Lord,” he saith, “O teach me Thy righteousness.” For because I have
hidden Thy words in my heart, that I may not sin against Thee, Thou hast
given a law; give also the blessing of Thy grace, that by doing right I
may learn what Thou by teaching hast commanded.…

<span id="ii.CXIX.ii-p9"></span>12. “With my lips have I been telling of
all the judgments of Thy mouth” ([Psa.
119.13](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#013.md)<span
id="ii.CXIX.ii-p9.1"></span>); that is, I have kept silent nothing of
Thy judgments, which Thou didst will should become known to me through
Thy words, but I have been telling of all of them without exception with
my lips. This he seemeth to me to signify, since he saith not, all Thy
judgments, but, “all the judgments of Thy mouth;” that is, which Thou
hast revealed unto me: that by His mouth we may understand His word,
which He hath discovered unto us in many revelations of the Saints, and
in the two Testaments; all which judgments the Church ceaseth not to
declare at all times with her lips.

<span id="ii.CXIX.ii-p10"></span>13. “I have had as great delight in the
way Thy testimonies, as in all manner of riches” ([Psa.
119.14](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#014.md)<span
id="ii.CXIX.ii-p10.1"></span>). We understand that there is no more
speedy, no more sure, no shorter, no higher way of the testimonies of
God than Christ, “in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and
knowledge.” <span id="fr_5141"></span>[5142](#fn_5141.md) Thence he saith
that he hath had as great delight in this way, as in all riches. Those
are the testimonies, by which He deigneth to prove unto us how much He
loveth us. <span id="fr_5142"></span>[5143](#fn_5142.md) …

<span id="ii.CXIX.ii-p13"></span>14. “I will talk of Thy commandments,
and have respect unto Thy ways” <span
id="fr_5143"></span>[5144](#fn_5143.md) ([Psa.
119.15](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#015.md)<span
id="ii.CXIX.ii-p14.2"></span>). And thus the Church doth exercise
herself in the commandments of God, by speaking in the copious
disputations of the learned against all the enemies of the Christian and
Catholic faith; which are fruitful to those who compose them, if nothing
but the ways of the Lord is regarded in them; but “All the ways of the
Lord are,” as it is written, “mercy and truth;” <span
id="fr_5144"></span>[5145](#fn_5144.md) the fulness of which both is found
in Christ. Through this sweet exercise is gained also what he
subjoineth: “My meditation shall be in Thy statutes, and I will not
forget Thy word” ([Psa. 119.16](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#016.md)<span
id="ii.CXIX.ii-p15.2"></span>). “My meditation” shall be therein, that I
may not forget them. Thus the blessed man in the first Psalm “shall
meditate in the law” of the Lord “day and night.” <span
id="fr_5145"></span>[5146](#fn_5145.md) …
