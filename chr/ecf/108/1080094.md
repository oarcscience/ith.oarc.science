<span id="ii.LXXXIII"></span>

<span id="ii.LXXXIII-p1"></span> <span id="ii.LXXXIII-p1.1"></span><span
class="c20"><span id="ii.LXXXIII-p1.2"></span>Psalm LXXXIII. <span
id="fr_3846"></span>[3847](#fn_3846.md) </span>

<span id="ii.LXXXIII-p3"></span>1. Of this Psalm the title is, “A song
of a Psalm of Asaph.” We have already often said what is the
interpretation of Asaph, that is, congregation. That man, therefore, who
was called Asaph, is named in representation of the congregation of
God’s people in the titles of many Psalms. But in Greek, congregation is
called synagogue, which has come to be held for a kind of proper name
for the Jewish people, that it should be called The Synagogue; even as
the Christian people is more usually called The Church, in that it too
is congregated.

<span id="ii.LXXXIII-p4"></span>2. The people of God, then, in this
Psalm saith, “O God, who shall be like unto Thee?” ([Psa.
83.1](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#001.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXIII-p4.1"></span>). Which I suppose to be more fitly taken of
Christ, because, being made in the likeness of men, <span
id="fr_3847"></span>[3848](#fn_3847.md) He was thought by those by whom He
was despised to be comparable to other men: for He was even “reckoned
among the unrighteous,” <span id="fr_3848"></span>[3849](#fn_3848.md) but
for this purpose, that He might be judged. But when He shall come to
judge, then shall be done what is here said, “O God, who is like unto
Thee?” For if the Psalms did not use to speak to the Lord Christ, that
too would not be spoken which not one of the faithful can doubt was
spoken unto Christ. “Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever, a sceptre
of righteousness is the sceptre of Thy kingdom.” <span
id="fr_3849"></span>[3850](#fn_3849.md) To him therefore also now it is
said, “O God, who shall be like unto Thee?” For unto many Thou didst
vouchsafe to be likened in Thy humiliation, even so far as to the
robbers that were crucified with Thee: but when in glory Thou shalt
come, “who shall be like unto Thee?”…

<span id="ii.LXXXIII-p8"></span>3. “For lo Thine enemies have sounded,
and they that hate Thee have lifted up the head” ([Psa.
83.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#002.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXIII-p8.1"></span>). He seems to me to signify the last days,
when these things that are now repressed by fear are to break forth into
free utterance, but quite irrational, so that it should rather be called
a “sound,” than speech or discourse. They will not, therefore, then
begin to hate, but “they that hate Thee” will then “lift up the head.”
And not “heads,” but “head;” since they are to come even to that point,
that they shall have that head, which “is lifted up above all that is
called God, and that is worshipped;” <span
id="fr_3850"></span>[3851](#fn_3850.md) so that in him especially is to be
fulfilled, “He that exalteth himself shall be abased;” <span
id="fr_3851"></span>[3852](#fn_3851.md) and when He to whom it is said,
“Keep not silence, nor grow mild, O God,” shall “slay him with the
breath of His mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of His
coming.” <span id="fr_3852"></span>[3853](#fn_3852.md) “Upon Thy people
they have malignantly taken counsel” ([Psa.
83.3](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#003.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXIII-p11.2"></span>). Or, as other copies have it, “They have
cunningly devised counsel, and have devised against Thy saints.” In
scorn this is said. For how should they be able to hurt the nation or
people of God, or His saints, who know how to say, “If God be for us,
who shall be against us?” <span id="fr_3853"></span>[3854](#fn_3853.md)

<span id="ii.LXXXIII-p13"></span>4. “They have said, Come, and let us
destroy them from a nation” ([Psa.
83.4](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#004.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXIII-p13.1"></span>). He has put the singular number for the
plural: as it is said, “Whose is this cattle,” even though the question
be of a flock, and the meaning “these cattle.” Lastly, other copies have
“from nations,” where <span id="page_398">p. 398</span> <span
id="ii.LXXXIII-Page_398"></span>the translators have rather followed the
sense than the word. “Come, and let us destroy them from a nation.” This
is that sound whereby they “sounded” rather than spake, since they did
vainly make a noise with vain sayings. “And let it not be mentioned of
the name of Israel any more.” This others have expressed more plainly,
“and let there not be remembrance of the name of Israel any more.”
Since, “let it be mentioned of the name” (*memoretur nominis*), is an
unusual phrase in the Latin language; for it is rather customary to say,
“let the name be mentioned” (*memoretur nomen*); but the sense is the
same. For he who said, “let it be mentioned of the name,” translated the
Greek phrase. But Israel must here be understood in fact of the seed of
Abraham, to which the Apostle saith, “Therefore ye are the seed of
Abraham, according to the promise heirs.” <span
id="fr_3854"></span>[3855](#fn_3854.md) Not Israel according to the flesh,
of which he saith, “Behold Israel after the flesh.”

<span id="ii.LXXXIII-p15"></span>5. “Since they have imagined with one
consent; together against Thee have they disposed a testament” ([Psa.
83.5](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#005.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXIII-p15.1"></span>): as though they could be the stronger. In
fact, “a testament” is a name given in the Scriptures not only to that
which is of no avail till the death of the testators, but every covenant
and decree they used to call a testament. For Laban and Jacob made a
testament, <span id="fr_3855"></span>[3856](#fn_3855.md) which was
certainly to have force between the living; and such cases without
number are read in the words of God. Then he begins to make mention of
the enemies of Christ, under certain proper names of nations; the
interpretation of which names sufficiently indicates what he would have
to be understood. For by such names are most suitably figured the
enemies of the truth. “Idumæans,” for instance, are interpreted either
“men of blood,” or “of earth.” “Ismaelites,” are “obedient to
themselves,” and therefore not to God, but to themselves. “Moab,” “from
the father;” which in a bad sense has no better explanation, than by
considering it so connected with the actual history, that Lot, a father,
by the illicit intercourse procured by his daughter, begat him; since it
was from that very circumstance he was so named. <span
id="fr_3856"></span>[3857](#fn_3856.md) Good, however, was his father, but
as “the Law is good if one use it lawfully,” <span
id="fr_3857"></span>[3858](#fn_3857.md) not impurely and unlawfully.
“Hagarens,” proselytes, that is strangers, by which name also are
signified, among the enemies of God’s people, not those who become
citizens, but those who persevere in a foreign and alien mind, and when
an opportunity of doing harm occurs, show themselves. “Gebal,” “a vain
valley,” that is, humble in pretence. “Amon,” “an unquiet people,” or “a
people of sadness.” “Amalech,” “a people licking;” whence elsewhere it
is said, “and his enemies shall lick the earth.” <span
id="fr_3858"></span>[3859](#fn_3858.md) The “alien race,” though by their
very name in Latin, they sufficiently show themselves to be aliens, and
for this cause of course enemies, yet in the Hebrew are called
“Philistines,” which is explained, “falling from drink,” as of persons
made drunken by worldly luxury. “Tyre” in Hebrew is called Sor; which
whether it be interpreted straitness or tribulation, must be taken in
the case of these enemies of God’s people in that sense, of which the
Apostle speaks, “Tribulation and straitness on every soul of man that
doeth evil.” <span id="fr_3859"></span>[3860](#fn_3859.md) All these are
thus enumerated in the Psalms: “The tabernacles of the Edomites,
Ishmaelites, Moab and the Hagarenes, Gebal, and Amon, and Amalech, and
the Philistines with those who inhabit Tyre.”

<span id="ii.LXXXIII-p21"></span>6. And as if to point out the cause why
they are enemies of God’s people, he adds, “For Assur came with them.”
Now Assur is often used figuratively for the devil, “who works in the
children of disobedience,” <span id="fr_3860"></span>[3861](#fn_3860.md) as
in his own vessels, that they may assail the people of God. “They have
holpen the children of Lot,” he saith: for all enemies, by the working
in them of the devil, their prince, “have holpen the children of Lot,”
who is explained to mean “one declining.” But the apostate angels are
well explained as the children of declension, for by declining from
truth they swerved to become followers of the devil. These are they of
whom the Apostle speaks: “Ye wrestle not against flesh and blood, but
against principalities and powers, and the rulers of the darkness of
this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.” <span
id="fr_3861"></span>[3862](#fn_3861.md) Those invisible <span
id="fr_3862"></span>[3863](#fn_3862.md) enemies are holpen then by
unbelieving men, in whom they work in order to assail the people of God.

<span id="ii.LXXXIII-p25"></span>7. Now let us see what the prophetic
spirit prays may fall upon them, rather foretelling than cursing. “Do
thou to them,” he saith, “as unto Madian and Sisera, as unto Jabin at
the brook of Kishon” ([Psa. 83.9](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#009.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXIII-p25.1"></span>). “They perished at Endor, they became as
the dung of the earth” ([Psa.
83.10](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#010.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXIII-p25.2"></span>). All these, the history relates, were
subdued and conquered by Israel, which then was the people of God: as
was the case also with those whom he next mentions: “Make their princes
like Oreb and Zeb, and Zebee and Salmana” ([Psa.
83.11](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#011.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXIII-p25.3"></span>). The meaning of these names is as
follows: Madian is explained a perverted judgment: Sisera, shutting out
of joy: Jabin, wise. <span id="fr_3863"></span>[3864](#fn_3863.md) But in
these enemies conquered by God’s people is to be understood that wise
man of whom the Apostle speaketh, “Where is the wise? where is the
scribe? where is the disputer of this world?” <span
id="fr_3864"></span>[3865](#fn_3864.md) Oreb is dryness, Zeb, wolf, Zebee,
a victim, namely of the wolf; <span id="page_399">p. 399</span> <span
id="ii.LXXXIII-Page_399"></span>for he too has his victims; Salmana,
shadow of commotion. All these agree to the evils which the people of
God conquer by good. Moreover Kishon, the torrent in which they were
conquered, is explained, their hardness. Endor, where they perished, is
explained, the Fountain of generation, but of the carnal generation
namely, to which they were given up, and therefore perished, not heeding
the regeneration which leadeth unto life, where they shall neither marry
nor be given in marriage, <span id="fr_3865"></span>[3866](#fn_3865.md) for
they shall die no more. Rightly then it is said of these: “they became
as the dung of the earth,” in that nothing was produced of them but
fruitfulness of the earth. As then all these were in figure conquered by
the people of God, as figures, so he prays that those other enemies may
be conquered in truth.

<span id="ii.LXXXIII-p29"></span>8. “All their princes, who said, Let us
take to ourselves the sanctuary of God in possession” ([Psa.
83.12](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#012.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXIII-p29.1"></span>). This is that vain noise, with which, as
said above, Thy enemies have made a murmuring. But what must be
understood by “the sanctuary of God,” except the temple of God? as saith
the Apostle: “For the temple of God is holy, <span
id="fr_3866"></span>[3867](#fn_3866.md) which temple ye are.” <span
id="fr_3867"></span>[3868](#fn_3867.md) For what else do the enemies aim
at, but to take into possession, that is, to make subject to themselves
the temple of God, that it may give in to their ungodly wills?

<span id="ii.LXXXIII-p32"></span>9. But what follows? “My God, make them
like unto a wheel” ([Psa. 83.13](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#013.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXIII-p32.1"></span>). This is fitly taken as meaning that they
should be constant in nothing that they think; but I think it may also
be rightly explained, make them like unto a wheel, because a wheel is
lifted up on the part of what is behind, <span
id="fr_3868"></span>[3869](#fn_3868.md) is thrown down on the part of what
is in front; and so it happens to all the enemies of the people of God.
For this is not a wish, but a prophecy. He adds: “as the stubble in the
face of the wind.” By face he means presence; for what face hath the
wind, which has no bodily features, being only a motion, in that it is a
kind of wave of air? But it is put for temptation, by which light and
vain hearts are hurried away.

<span id="ii.LXXXIII-p34"></span>10. This levity, by which consent is
easily given to what is evil, is followed by severe torment; therefore
he proceeds:—

<span id="ii.LXXXIII-p35"></span>“Like as the fire that burneth up the
wood, and as the flame that consumeth the mountains” ([Psa.
83.14](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#014.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXIII-p35.1"></span>): “so shalt Thou persecute them with Thy
tempest, and in Thy anger shalt disturb them” ([Psa.
83.15](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#015.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXIII-p35.2"></span>). Wood, he saith, for its barrenness,
mountains for their loftiness; for such are the enemies of God’s people,
barren of righteousness, full of pride. When he says, “fire” and
“flame,” he means to repeat under another term, the idea of God judging
and punishing. But in saying, “with Thy tempest,” he means, as he goes
on to explain, “Thy anger:” and the former expression, “Thou shalt
persecute,” answers to, “Thou shalt disturb.” We must take care,
however, to understand, that the anger of God is free from any turbulent
emotion; for His anger is an expression for His just method of taking
vengeance: as the law might be said to be angry when its ministers are
moved to punish by its sanction.

<span id="ii.LXXXIII-p36"></span>11. “Fill their faces with shame, and
they shall seek Thy name, O Lord” ([Psa.
83.16](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#016.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXIII-p36.1"></span>). Good and desirable is this which he
prophesieth for them: and he would not prophesy thus, unless there were
even in that company of the enemies of God’s people, some men of such
kind that this would be granted to them before the last judgment: for
now they are mixed together, and this is the body of the enemies, in
respect of the envy whereby they rival the people of God. And now, where
they can, they make a noise and lift up their head: but severally, not
universally as they will do at the end of the world, when the last
judgment is about to fall. But it is the same body, even in those who
out of this number shall believe and pass into another body (for the
faces of these are filled with shame, that they may seek the name of the
Lord), as well as in those others who persevere unto the end in the same
wickedness, who are made as stubble before the wind, and are consumed
like a wood and barren mountains. To these he again returns, saying,
“They shall blush and be vexed for ever and ever” ([Psa.
83.17](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#017.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXIII-p36.2"></span>). For those are not vexed for ever and
ever who seek the name of the Lord, but having respect unto the shame of
their sins, they are vexed for this purpose, that they may seek the name
of the Lord, through which they may be no more vexed.

<span id="ii.LXXXIII-p37"></span>12. Again, he returns to these last,
who in the same company of enemies are to be made ashamed for this
purpose, that they may not be ashamed for ever: and for this purpose to
be destroyed in as far as they are wicked, that being made good they may
be found alive for ever. For having said of them, “Let them be ashamed
and perish,” he instantly adds, “and let them know that Thy name is the
Lord, Thou art only the Most Highest in all the earth” ([Psa.
83.18](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#018.md)<span
id="ii.LXXXIII-p37.1"></span>). Coming to this knowledge, let them be so
confounded as to please God: let them so perish, as that they may abide.
“Let them know,” he says, “that Thy name is the Lord:” as if whoever
else are called lords are named so not truly but by falsehood, for they
rule but as servants, and compared with the true Lord are not lords; as
it is said, <span class="c21"><span id="ii.LXXXIII-p37.2"></span>I Am
that I Am</span>: <span id="fr_3869"></span>[3870](#fn_3869.md) as if those
things <span id="page_400">p. 400</span> <span
id="ii.LXXXIII-Page_400"></span>which are made are not, compared with
Him by whom they are made. He adds, “Thou only art the Most Highest in
all the earth:” or, as other copies have it, “over all the earth;” as it
might be said, in all the heaven, or over all the heaven: but he used
the latter word in preference, to depress the pride of earth. For earth
ceaseth to be proud, that is, man ceaseth, to whom it was said, “Thou
art dust;”  <span id="fr_3870"></span>[3871](#fn_3870.md) and “why is earth
and ashes proud?” <span id="fr_3871"></span>[3872](#fn_3871.md) when he
saith that the Lord is the Most Highest above all the earth, that is,
that no man’s thoughts avail against those “who are called according to
His purpose,” and of whom it is said, “If God is for us, who can be
against us?” <span id="fr_3872"></span>[3873](#fn_3872.md)
