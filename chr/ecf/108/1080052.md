<span id="ii.XLV-p1"></span> <span id="ii.XLV-p1.1"></span><span
class="c20"><span id="ii.XLV-p1.2"></span>Psalm XLV. <span
id="fr_1362"></span>[1363](#fn_1362.md) </span>

<span id="ii.XLV-p3"></span>1. This Psalm, even as we ourselves have
been singing with gladness together with you, we would beg you in like
manner to consider with attention together with us. For it is sung of
the sacred Marriage-feast; of the Bridegroom and the Bride; of the King
and His people; of the Saviour and those who are to be saved.…His sons
are we, in that we are the “children of the Bridegroom;” and it is to us
that this Psalm is addressed, whose title has the words, “For the sons
of Korah, for the things that <span id="fr_1363"></span>[1364](#fn_1363.md)
shall be changed.”

<span id="ii.XLV-p5"></span>2. Why need I explain what is meant by, “for
the things that shall be changed”? Every one who is himself “changed,”
recognises the meaning of this. Let him who hears this, “for the things
that shall be changed,” consider what was before, and what is now. And
first let him see the world itself to be changed, lately worshipping
idols, now worshipping God; lately serving things that they themselves
made, now serving Him by whom they themselves were made. Observe at what
time the words, “for the things that shall be changed,” were said.
Already by this time the Pagans that are left are in dread of the
“changed” state of things: and those who will not suffer themselves to
be <span id="page_146">p. 146</span> <span
id="ii.XLV-Page_146"></span>“changed” see the churches full; the temples
deserted; see crowds here, and there solitude! They marvel at the things
so changed; let them read that they were foretold; let them lend their
ears to Him who promised it; let them believe Him who fulfils that
promise. But each one of us, brethren, also undergoes a change from “the
old” to “the new man:” from an infidel to a believer: from a thief to a
giver of alms: from an adulterer to a man of chastity; from an evildoer
to a doer of good. To us then be sung the words, “for the things that
shall be changed;” and so let the description of Him by whom they were
changed, begin.

<span id="ii.XLV-p6"></span>3. For it goes on, “For the things that
shall be changed, to the sons of Korah for understanding; a song for the
beloved.” For that “beloved” One was seen by His persecutors, but yet
not for “understanding.” For “had they known Him, they would never have
crucified the Lord of Glory.” <span id="fr_1364"></span>[1365](#fn_1364.md)
In order to this “understanding,” other eyes were required by Him when
He said, “He that seeth Me, seeth My Father also.” <span
id="fr_1365"></span>[1366](#fn_1365.md) Let the Psalm then now sound of
Him, let us rejoice in the marriage-feast, and we shall be with those of
whom the marriage is made, <span id="fr_1366"></span>[1367](#fn_1366.md)
who are invited to the marriage; and the very persons invited are the
Bride herself. For the Church is “the Bride,” Christ the Bridegroom.
There are commonly spoken by balladists <span
id="fr_1367"></span>[1368](#fn_1367.md) certain verses to Bridegrooms and
Brides, called *Epithalamia*. <span id="fr_1368"></span>[1369](#fn_1368.md)
Whatever is sung there, is sung in honour of the Bride and Bridegroom.
Is there then no Bridechamber <span id="fr_1369"></span>[1370](#fn_1369.md)
in that marriage-feast to which we are invited? Whence then does another
Psalm say, “He hath set up His tabernacle in the Sun; and He is even as
a bridegroom coming out of his chamber.” The nuptial union is that of
“the Word,” and the flesh. The Bridechamber of this union, the Virgin’s
womb. For the flesh itself was united to the Word: whence also it is
said, “Henceforth they are not twain, but one flesh.” <span
id="fr_1370"></span>[1371](#fn_1370.md) The Church was assumed unto Him out
of the human race: so that the Flesh itself, being united to the Word,
might be the Head of the Church: and the rest who believe, members of
that Head.…

<span id="ii.XLV-p14"></span>4. “Mine heart hath uttered a good
word” <span id="fr_1371"></span>[1372](#fn_1371.md) ([Psa.
45.1](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#001)<span id="ii.XLV-p15.1"></span>.md).
Who is the speaker? The Father, or the Prophet? For some understand it
to be the Person of the Father, which says, “Mine heart hath uttered a
good word,” intimating to us a certain unspeakable generation. <span
id="fr_1372"></span>[1373](#fn_1372.md) Lest you should haply think
something to have been taken unto Him, out of which God should beget the
Son (just as man takes something to himself out of which he begets
children, that is to say, an union of marriage, <span
id="fr_1373"></span>[1374](#fn_1373.md) without which man cannot beget
offspring), lest then you should think that God stood in need of any
nuptial union, to beget “the Son,” he says, “Mine heart hath uttered a
good word.” <span id="fr_1374"></span>[1375](#fn_1374.md) This very day
thine heart, O man, begets a counsel, and requires no wife: by the
counsel, so born of thine heart, thou buildest something or other, and
before that building subsists, the design subsists; <span
id="fr_1375"></span>[1376](#fn_1375.md) and that which thou art about to
produce, exists already in that by which thou art going to produce it;
and thou praisest the fabric that as yet is not existing, not yet in the
visible form of a building, but on the projecting of a design: nor does
any one else praise thy design, unless either thou showest it to him, or
he sees what thou hast done. If then by the Word “all things were
made,” <span id="fr_1376"></span>[1377](#fn_1376.md) and the Word is of
God, consider the fabric reared by the Word, and learn from that
building to admire His counsels! What manner of Word is that by which
heaven and earth were made; <span id="fr_1377"></span>[1378](#fn_1377.md)
and all the splendour of the heavens; all the fertility of the earth;
the expanse of the sea; the wide diffusion of air; the brightness of the
constellations; the light of sun and moon? These are visible things:
rise above these also; think of the Angels, “Principalities, Thrones,
Dominions, and Powers.” <span id="fr_1378"></span>[1379](#fn_1378.md) All
were made by Him. How then were these good things made? Because there
was “uttered forth ‘a good Word,’” by which they were to be made.…

<span id="ii.XLV-p23"></span>5. It proceeds: “I speak of the things
which I have made unto the King.” Is the Father still speaking? If the
Father is still speaking, let us enquire how this also can be understood
by us, consistently with the true Catholic Faith, “I speak of the things
that I have made unto the King.” For if it is the Father speaking of His
own works to His Son, our “King,” what works is the Father to speak of
to the Son, seeing that all the Father’s works were made by the Son’s
agency? Or, in the words, “I speak of My works unto the King,” does the
word, “I speak,” itself signify the generation of the Son? <span
id="page_147">p. 147</span> <span id="ii.XLV-Page_147"></span>I fear
whether this can ever be made intelligible to those slow of
comprehension: I will nevertheless say it. Let those who can follow me,
do so: lest if it were left unsaid, even those who can follow should not
be able. We have read where it is said in another Psalm, “God hath
spoken once.”  <span id="fr_1379"></span>[1380](#fn_1379.md) So often has
He spoken by the Prophets, so often by the Apostles, and in these days
by His Saints, and does He say, “God has spoken once”? How can He have
spoken but “once,” except with reference to His “Word”? <span
id="fr_1380"></span>[1381](#fn_1380.md) But as the “Mine heart hath uttered
a good Word,” <span id="fr_1381"></span>[1382](#fn_1381.md) was understood
by us in the other clause of the generation of the Son, it seems that a
kind of repetition is made in the following sentence, so that the “Mine
heart hath uttered a good Word,” which had been already said, is
repeated in what He is now saying, “I speak.” For what does “I speak”
mean? “I utter a Word.” And whence but from His heart, from His very
inmost, does God utter the Word? You yourself do not speak anything but
what you bring forth from your “heart,” this word of yours which sounds
once and passes away, is brought forth from no other place: and do you
wonder that God “speaks” in this manner? But God’s “speaking” is
eternal. You are speaking something at the present moment, because you
were silent before: or, look you, you have not yet brought forth your
word; but when you have begun to bring it forth, you as it were “break
silence;” and bring into being a word, that did not exist before. It was
not so God begat the “Word.” God’s “speaking” is without beginning, and
without end: and yet the “Word” He utters is but “One.” Let Him utter
another, if what He has spoken shall have passed away. But since He by
whom it is uttered abideth, and That which is uttered abideth; and is
uttered but once, and has no end, that very “once” too is said without
beginning, and there is no second speaking, because that which is said
once, does not pass away. The words “Mine heart hath uttered a good
Word,” then, are the same thing with, “I speak of the things which I
have made unto the King.” Why then, “I speak of the things which I have
made”? Because in the Word Itself are all the works of God. For whatever
God designed to make in the creation already existed in “the Word;” and
would not exist in the reality, had it not existed in the Word, <span
id="fr_1382"></span>[1383](#fn_1382.md) just as with you the thing would
not exist in the building, had it not existed in your design: even as it
is said in the Gospel: “That which was made in Him was life.” <span
id="fr_1383"></span>[1384](#fn_1383.md) That which was made then was in
existence; but it had its existence in the Word: and all the works of
God existed there, and yet were not as yet “works.” “The Word” however
already was, as this “Word was God, and was with God:” and was the Son
of God, and One God with the Father. “I speak of the things I have made
unto the King.” Let him hear Him “speaking,” who apprehends “the Word:”
and let him see together with the Father the Everlasting Word; in whom
exist even those things that are yet to come: in whom even those things
that are past have not passed away. These “works” of God are in “the
Word,” as in the Word, as in the Only-Begotten, as in the “Word of God.”

<span id="ii.XLV-p29"></span>6. What follows then? “My tongue is the pen
of a writer writing rapidly.” What likeness, my brethren, what likeness,
I ask, has the “tongue” of God with a transcriber’s pen? What
resemblance has “the rock” to Christ? <span
id="fr_1384"></span>[1385](#fn_1384.md) What likeness does the “lamb” bear
to our Saviour, <span id="fr_1385"></span>[1386](#fn_1385.md) or what “the
lion” to the strength of the Only-Begotten? <span
id="fr_1386"></span>[1387](#fn_1386.md) Yet such comparisons have been
made; and were they not made, we should not be formed to a certain
extent by these visible things to the knowledge of the “Invisible One.”
So then with this mean simile of the pen; let us not compare it to His
excellent greatness, so let us not reject it with contempt. For I ask,
why He compares His “tongue” to “the pen of a writer writing rapidly”?
But how swiftly soever the transcriber writes, still it is not
comparable to that swiftness of which another Psalm says, “His word
runneth very swiftly.” <span id="fr_1387"></span>[1388](#fn_1387.md) But it
appears to me (if human understanding may presume so far) that this too
may be understood as spoken in the Person of the Father: “My tongue is
the pen of a writer.” Inasmuch as what is spoken by the “tongue,” sounds
once and passes away, what is written, remains; seeing then that God
uttereth “a Word,” and the Word which is uttered does not sound once and
pass away, but is uttered and yet continues, God chose rather to compare
this to words written than to sounds. But what He added, saying, “of one
writing swiftly,” stimulates the mind unto “understanding.” Let it
however not slothfully rest here, thinking of transcribers, <span
id="fr_1388"></span>[1389](#fn_1388.md) or thinking of some kind of quick
shorthand writers: if it be this it sees in the passage, it will be
resting there. Let it think swiftly what is the meaning of that word
“swiftly.” The “swiftly” of God is such that nothing exceeds in
swiftness. For in writings letter is written after letter; syllable
after syllable; word after word: nor do we pass to the second except
when the first is written out. But there nothing can exceed the
swiftness, where there are not several words; and yet there is not
anything <span id="page_148">p. 148</span> <span
id="ii.XLV-Page_148"></span>omitted: since in the One are contained all
things.

<span id="ii.XLV-p35"></span>7. Lo! now then that Word, so uttered,
Eternal, the Co-eternal Offspring of the Eternal, will come as “the
Bridegroom;” “Fairer than the children of men” ([Psa.
45.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#002)<span id="ii.XLV-p35.1"></span>.md).
“Than the children of men.” I ask, why not than the Angels also? Why did
he say, “than the children of men,” except because He was Man? Lest you
should think “the Man Christ” <span id="fr_1389"></span>[1390](#fn_1389.md)
to be any ordinary man, he says, “Fairer than the children of men.” Even
though Himself “Man,” He is “fairer than the children of men;” though
among the children of men, “fairer than the children of men:” though of
the children of men, “fairer than the children of men.” “Grace is shed
abroad on Thy lips.” “The Law was given by Moses. Grace and Truth came
by Jesus Christ.” <span id="fr_1390"></span>[1391](#fn_1390.md) …

<span id="ii.XLV-p38"></span>8. There have not been wanting those who
preferred understanding all the preceding passage also of the Prophet’s
own person; and would have even this verse, “Mine heart hath uttered
forth a good word,” understood as spoken by the Prophet, supposed to be
uttering a hymn. For whoever utters a hymn to God, his heart is, as it
were, “uttering forth a good word,” just as his heart who blasphemes
God, is uttering forth an evil word. So that even by what follows, “I
speak of the things which I have made <span
id="fr_1391"></span>[1392](#fn_1391.md) unto the King,” he meant to express
that man’s chief work was but to praise God. To Him it belongs to
satisfy thee, by His beauty; to thee to praise Him with thanksgiving.…

<span id="ii.XLV-p40"></span>9. “My tongue is the pen of a writer
writing quickly.” There have been persons who have understood the
Prophet to have been describing in this manner what he was writing; and
therefore to have compared his tongue to “the pen of a writer writing
quickly:” but that he chose to express himself in the words “writing
quickly,” to signify, that he was writing of things which were to come
“quickly;” that “writing quickly” should be understood to be equivalent
to “writing things that are quick;” i.e. writing things that would not
long tarry. For God did not tarry long to manifest Christ. How quickly
is that perceived to have rolled by, which is acknowledged to be already
past! Call to mind the generations before thee; thou wilt find that the
making of Adam is but a thing of yesterday. So do we read that all
things have gone on from the very beginning: <span
id="fr_1392"></span>[1393](#fn_1392.md) they were therefore done “quickly.”
The day of Judgment also will be here “quickly.” Do thou anticipate its
“quick” coming. It is to come “quickly;” do thou become converted yet
more “quickly.” The Judge’s face will appear: but observe thou what the
Prophet says, “Let us come before” (let us “prevent”) “His face with
confession.” <span id="fr_1393"></span>[1394](#fn_1393.md)

<span id="ii.XLV-p43"></span>10. “Gird Thy sword upon Thy thigh, O most
Mighty” ([Psa. 45.3](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#003.md)<span
id="ii.XLV-p43.1"></span>). What is meant by “Thy sword,” but “Thy
word”? It was by that sword He scattered His enemies; by that sword he
divided the son from the father, “the daughter from the mother, the
daughter-in-law from the mother-in-law.” We read these words in the
Gospel, “I came not to send peace, but a sword.” <span
id="fr_1394"></span>[1395](#fn_1394.md) And, “In one house shall five be
divided against each other; three against two, and two against
three;” <span id="fr_1395"></span>[1396](#fn_1395.md) i.e. “the father
against the son, the daughter against the mother, the daughter-in-law
against the mother-in-law.” By what “sword,” but that which Christ
brought, was this division wrought? And indeed, my brethren, we see this
exemplified daily. Some young man is minded to give himself up to God’s
service; his father is opposed to it; they are “divided against each
other:” the one promises an earthly inheritance, the other loves an
heavenly; the one promises one thing, the other prefers another. The
father should not think himself wronged: God alone is preferred to him.
And yet he is at strife <span id="fr_1396"></span>[1397](#fn_1396.md) with
the son, who would fain give himself to God’s service. But the spiritual
sword is mightier to separate them, than the ties of carnal nature to
bind them together. This happens also in the case of a mother against
her daughter; still more also in that of a daughter-in-law against a
mother-in-law. For sometimes in one house mother-in-law and daughter-in
law are found orthodox and heretical respectively. And where that sword
is forcibly felt,  <span id="fr_1397"></span>[1398](#fn_1397.md) we do not
dread the repetition of Baptism. Could daughter be divided against
mother; and could not daughter-in-law be divided against mother-in-law?…

<span id="ii.XLV-p48"></span>11. What does he mean to express by the
“thigh”? The flesh. Whence those words, “A prince shall not depart from
Judah; and a lawgiver from his thighs”? <span
id="fr_1398"></span>[1399](#fn_1398.md) Did not Abraham himself (to whom
was promised the seed in which “all the nations of the earth were to be
blessed”), when he sent his servant to seek and to bring home a wife for
his son, being by faith fully persuaded, that in that, so to speak,
contemptible seed was contained the great Name; <span
id="fr_1399"></span>[1400](#fn_1399.md) that is, that the Son of God was to
come of the seed of Abraham, out of all the <span id="page_149">p.
149</span> <span id="ii.XLV-Page_149"></span>children of men; did not
he, I say, cause his servant to swear unto him in this manner, saying,
“Put thy hand under my thigh,” <span
id="fr_1400"></span>[1401](#fn_1400.md) and so swear; as if he had said,
“Put thy hand on the altar, or on the Gospel, or on the Prophet, or on
any holy thing.” “Put” (he says) “thy hand under my thigh;” having full
confidence, not ashamed of it as unseemly, but understanding therein a
truth. “With Thy beauty and Thy glory.” Take to Thee that righteousness,
in which Thou art at all times beautiful and glorious. “And speed on,
and proceed prosperously, and reign” ([Psa.
45.4](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#004)<span id="ii.XLV-p51.2"></span>.md).
Do we not see it so? Is it not already come to pass? He has “sped on;
has proceeded prosperously, and He reigns;” all nations are subdued unto
Him. What a thing was it to see that “in the Spirit,” of which same
thing it is now in our power to experience in the reality! At the time
when these words were said, Christ did not yet “reign” thus; had not yet
sped on, nor “proceeded prosperously.” They were then being preached,
they have now been fulfilled: in many things we have God’s promise
fulfilled already; in some few we have to claim its fulfilment yet.

<span id="ii.XLV-p52"></span>12. “Because of truth, meekness, and
righteousness.” Truth was restored unto us, when “the Truth sprung out
of the earth: and Righteousness looked out from heaven.” <span
id="fr_1401"></span>[1402](#fn_1401.md) Christ was presented to the
expectation of mankind, that in Abraham’s Seed “all nations should be
blessed.” The Gospel has been preached. It is “the Truth.” What is meant
by “meekness”? The Martyrs have suffered; and the kingdom of God has
made much progress from thence, and advanced throughout all nations;
because the Martyrs suffered, and neither “fell away,” nor yet offered
resistance; confessing everything, concealing nothing; prepared for
everything, shrinking from nothing. Marvellous “meekness”! This did the
body of Christ, by its Head it learned. He was first “led as a sheep to
the slaughter, and as a lamb before his shearer is dumb, even so opened
not His mouth;” <span id="fr_1402"></span>[1403](#fn_1402.md) meek to that
degree, that while hanging on the Cross, He said, “Father, forgive them,
for they know not what they do.” <span
id="fr_1403"></span>[1404](#fn_1403.md) Why because of “righteousness”? He
will come also to judge, and to “render to every man according to his
works.” He spake “the truth;” He patiently endured unrighteousness: He
is to bring “righteousness” hereafter.

<span id="ii.XLV-p56"></span>13. “And Thy right hand shall lead Thee on
marvellously.” We shall be guided on by His right hand: He by His own.
For He is God, we mortal men. He was led on by His own right hand; i.e.
by His own power. For the power which the Father hath, He hath also; the
Father’s immortality He hath also; He hath the Father’s Divinity, the
Father’s Eternity, the Father’s Power. <span
id="fr_1404"></span>[1405](#fn_1404.md) Marvellously will His right hand
lead Him on, performing the works of God; undergoing human sufferings,
overthrowing the evil wills <span id="fr_1405"></span>[1406](#fn_1405.md)
of men by His own goodness. Even now, He is being led on even to places
where as yet He is not; and it is His own right hand that is leading Him
on. For that is leading Him thither which He has Himself bestowed upon
His Saints. “Thy right hand shall lead Thee on marvellously.”

<span id="ii.XLV-p59"></span>14. “Thine arrows are sharp, are most
powerful” ([Psa. 45.5](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#005.md)<span
id="ii.XLV-p59.1"></span>); words that pierce the heart, that kindle
love. Whence in the Song of Songs it is said, “I am wounded with
love.” <span id="fr_1406"></span>[1407](#fn_1406.md) For she speaks of
being “wounded with love;” that is, of being in love, of being inflamed
with passion, of sighing for the Bridegroom, from whom she received the
arrow of the Word. “Thine arrows are sharp, are most powerful;” both
piercing, and effective; “sharp, most powerful.” “The peoples shall fall
under Thee.” Who have “fallen”? They who were “wounded” have also
“fallen.” We see the nations subdued unto Christ; we do not see them
“fall.” He explains where they “fall,” viz. “in the heart.” It was there
they lifted themselves up against Christ, there they “fall” down before
Christ. Saul was a blasphemer of Christ: he was then lifted up, he prays
to Christ, “he is fallen,” he is prostrate before Him: the enemy of
Christ is slain, that the disciple of Christ may live! By an arrow
launched from heaven, Saul (not as yet Paul, but still Saul), still
lifted up, still not yet prostrate, is wounded in “the heart:” he
received the arrow, he fell “in heart.” For though he fell prostrate on
his face, it was not there that he fell down in heart: <span
id="fr_1407"></span>[1408](#fn_1407.md) but it was there where he said
aloud, “Lord, what dost Thou bid me do?” <span
id="fr_1408"></span>[1409](#fn_1408.md) But just now thou wert going to
bind the Christians, and to bring them to punishment: and now thou
sayest unto Christ, “What dost Thou bid me do?” O arrow sharp and most
mighty, by whose stroke “Saul” fell, so as to become “Paul.” As it was
with him, so was it also with “the peoples;” consider the nations,
observe their subjection unto Christ. “The peoples” (then) “shall fall
under Thee in the heart of the King’s enemies;” that is, in the heart of
Thine enemies. For it is Him that he calls King, Him that he recognises
as King. “The peoples shall fall under Thee in the heart of the King’s
enemies.” They were “enemies” before; they have been stricken by thine
arrows: they have fallen before Thee. Out of enemies they have been made
<span id="page_150">p. 150</span> <span
id="ii.XLV-Page_150"></span>friends: the enemies are dead, the friends
survive. This is the meaning of, “for those which shall be changed.” We
are seeking to “understand” each single word, and each separate verse;
yet so far only are we to seek for their “understanding,” as to leave no
one to doubt that they are spoken of Christ.

<span id="ii.XLV-p63"></span>15. “Thy throne, O God, is for ever and
ever” ([Psa. 45.6](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#006.md)<span
id="ii.XLV-p63.1"></span>). Because God has “‘blessed Thee’ for ever,”
on account of the “grace poured over Thy lips.” Now the throne of the
Jewish Kingdom was a temporal one; belonging to those who were under the
Law, not to those who were under “grace:” He came to “redeem those who
were under the Law,” and to place them under “Grace.” His “Throne is for
ever and ever.” Why? for that first throne of the Kingdom was but a
temporal one: whence then have we a “throne for ever and ever”? Because
it is God’s throne. O divine Attribute of Eternity! <span
id="fr_1409"></span>[1410](#fn_1409.md) for God could not have a temporal
throne. “Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever—a sceptre of direction
is the sceptre of Thy Kingdom.” “The sceptre of direction” is that which
directs mankind: they were before crooked, distorted; they sought to
reign for themselves: they loved themselves, loved their own evil deeds:
they submitted not their own will to God; but would fain have bent God’s
will to conformity with their own lusts. For the sinner and the
unrighteous man is generally angry with God, because it rains not! <span
id="fr_1410"></span>[1411](#fn_1410.md) and yet would have God not be angry
with himself, because he is profligate. <span
id="fr_1411"></span>[1412](#fn_1411.md) And it is pretty much for this very
reason that men daily sit, to dispute against God: “This is what He
ought to have done: this He has not well done.” Thou forsooth seest what
thou doest; He knows not what He does! It is thou that art crooked! His
ways are right. When wilt thou make the crooked coincide with the
straight? It cannot be made to coincide with it. <span
id="fr_1412"></span>[1413](#fn_1412.md) Just as if you were to place a
crooked stick on a level pavement; it does not join on to it; it does
not cohere; it does not fit into the pavement. The pavement is even in
every part: but that is crooked; it does not fit into that which is
level. The will of God then is “equal,” thine own is “crooked:” it is
because thou canst not be conformed unto it, that it seems “crooked”
unto thee: rule thou thyself by it; seek not to bend it to thine own
will: for thou canst not accomplish it; that is at all times “straight”!
Wouldest thou abide in Him? “Correct thou thyself;” so will the sceptre
of Him who rules thee, be unto thee “a rule of direction.” Thence is He
also called King, <span id="fr_1413"></span>[1414](#fn_1413.md) from
“ruling.” For that is no “ruler” that does not correct. <span
id="fr_1414"></span>[1415](#fn_1414.md) Hereunto is our King a King of
“right ones.” <span id="fr_1415"></span>[1416](#fn_1415.md) Just as He is a
Priest (*Sacerdos*) by sanctifying us, so is He our King, our Ruler, by
“ruling” us.…

<span id="ii.XLV-p71"></span>16. “Thou hast loved righteousness, and
hated iniquity” ([Psa. 45.7](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#007.md)<span
id="ii.XLV-p71.1"></span>). See there “the rod of direction” described.
“Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity.” Draw near to that
“rod;” let Christ be thy King: let Him “rule” thee with that rod, not
crush thee with it. For that rod is “a rod of iron;” an inflexible
rod. <span id="fr_1416"></span>[1417](#fn_1416.md) “Thou shalt rule them
with a rod of iron: and break them in pieces like a potter’s
vessel.” <span id="fr_1417"></span>[1418](#fn_1417.md) Some He rules;
others He “breaks in pieces:” He “rules” them that are spiritual: He
“breaks in pieces” them that are carnal.…Would He so loudly declare that
He was about to smite thee, if He wished to smite thee? He is then
holding back His hand from the punishment of thine offences; but do not
thou hold back. Turn thou thyself to the punishment of thine offences:
for unpunished offences cannot be: punishment therefore must be executed
either by thyself, or by Him: do thou then plead guilty, that He may
reprieve thee. Consider an instance in that penitential Psalm: “Hide Thy
face from my sins.” <span id="fr_1418"></span>[1419](#fn_1418.md) Did he
mean “from me”? No: for in another passage he says plainly, “Hide not
Thy face from me.” “Turn” then “Thy face from my sins.” I would have
Thee not see my sins. For God’s “seeing” is animadverting upon. Hence
too a Judge is said to “animadvert” <span
id="fr_1419"></span>[1420](#fn_1419.md) on that which he punishes; i.e. to
turn his mind on it, to bend it thereon, even to the punishment of it,
inasmuch as he is the Judge. So too is God a Judge. “Turn Thou Thy face
from my sins.” But thou thyself, if thou wouldest have God turn “His
face” from them, turn not thine own face from them. Observe how he
proposes this to God in that very Psalm: “I acknowledge,” he says, “my
transgression, and my sin is ever before me.”  <span
id="fr_1420"></span>[1421](#fn_1420.md) He would fain have that which he
wishes to be ever before his own eyes, not be before God’s eyes. Let no
one flatter himself with fond hopes of God’s mercy. His sceptre is “a
sceptre of righteousness.” Do we say that God is not merciful? What can
exceed His mercy, who shows such forbearance to sinners; who takes no
account of the past in all that turn unto Him? So love thou Him for His
mercy, as still to wish that He should be truthful. For mercy cannot
strip Him of His attribute of justice: nor justice of that of mercy.
Meanwhile during <span id="page_151">p. 151</span> <span
id="ii.XLV-Page_151"></span>the time that He postpones thy punishment,
do not thou postpone it.

<span id="ii.XLV-p77"></span>17. “Therefore, God, Thy God, hath anointed
Thee.” It was for this reason that He anointed thee, that thou mightest
love righteousness, and hate iniquity. And observe in what way he
expresses himself. “Therefore, God, Thy God, hath anointed Thee:” i.e.
“God hath anointed Thee, O God.” “God” is “anointed” by God. For in the
Latin it is thought to be the same case of the noun repeated: in the
Greek however there is a most evident distinction; one being the name of
the Person addressed; and one His who makes the address, saying, “God
hath anointed Thee.” “O God, Thy God hath anointed Thee,” just as if He
were saying, “Therefore hath Thy God, O God, anointed Thee.” Take it in
that sense, understand it in that sense; that such is the sense is most
evident in the Greek. Who then is the God that is “anointed” by God? Let
the Jews tell us; these Scriptures are common to us and them. It was
God, who was anointed by God: you hear of an “Anointed” one; understand
it to mean “Christ.” For the name of “Christ” comes from “chrism;” this
name by which He is called “Christ” expresses “unction:” nor were kings
and prophets anointed in any kingdom, in any other place, save in that
kingdom where Christ was prophesied of, where He was anointed, and from
whence the Name of Christ was to come. It is found nowhere else at all:
in no one nation or kingdom. God, then, was anointed by God; with what
oil was He anointed, but a spiritual one? For the visible oil is in the
sign, the invisible oil is in the mystery; <span
id="fr_1421"></span>[1422](#fn_1421.md) the spiritual oil is within. “God”
then was “anointed” for us, and sent unto us; and God Himself was man,
in order that He might be “anointed:” but He was man in such a way as to
be God still. He was God in such a way as not to disdain to be man.
“Very man and very God;” in nothing deceitful, in nothing false, as
being everywhere true, everywhere “the Truth” itself. God then is man;
and it was for this cause that “God” was “anointed,” because God was
Man, and became “Christ.”

<span id="ii.XLV-p79"></span>18. This was figured in Jacob’s placing a
stone at his head, and so sleeping. <span
id="fr_1422"></span>[1423](#fn_1422.md) The patriarch Jacob had placed a
stone at his head: sleeping with that stone at his head, he saw heaven
opened, and a ladder from heaven to earth, and Angels ascending and
descending; <span id="fr_1423"></span>[1424](#fn_1423.md) after this vision
he awaked, anointed the stone, and departed. In that “stone” he
understood Christ; for that reason he anointed it. Take notice what it
is whereby Christ is preached. What is the meaning of that anointing of
a stone, especially in the case of the Patriarchs who worshipped but One
God? It was however done as a figurative act: and he departed. For he
did not anoint the stone, and come to worship there constantly, and to
perform sacrifice there. It was the expression of a mystery; not the
commencement of sacrilege. And notice the meaning of “the stone.” “The
Stone which the builders refused, this is become the head of the
corner.” <span id="fr_1424"></span>[1425](#fn_1424.md) Notice here a great
mystery. The “Stone” is Christ. Peter calls Him “a living Stone,
disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God.” <span
id="fr_1425"></span>[1426](#fn_1425.md) And the stone is set at “the head,”
because “Christ is the Head of the man.” <span
id="fr_1426"></span>[1427](#fn_1426.md) And “the stone” was anointed,
because “Christ” was so called from His being anointed. And in the
revelation of Christ, the ladder from earth to heaven is seen, or from
heaven to earth, and the Angels ascending and descending. What this
means, we shall see more clearly, when we have quoted the testimony from
the Lord Himself in the Gospel. You know that Jacob is the same as
Israel. For when he wrestled with the Angel, and “prevailed,” and had
been blest by Him over whom he prevailed, his named was changed, so that
he was called “Israel;” just as the people of Israel “prevailed” <span
id="fr_1427"></span>[1428](#fn_1427.md) against Christ, so as to crucify
Him, and nevertheless was (in those who believed in Christ) blest by Him
over whom it prevailed. But many believed not; hence the halting of
Jacob. Here we have at once, blessing and halting. Blessing on those who
became believers; for we know that afterward many of that people did
believe: Halting on the other hand in those who believed not. And
because the greater part believed not, and but few believed, therefore
that a halting might be produced, He touched “the breadth <span
id="fr_1428"></span>[1429](#fn_1428.md) of his thigh.” <span
id="fr_1429"></span>[1430](#fn_1429.md) What is meant by the breadth of the
thigh? The great multitude of his descendants. <span
id="fr_1430"></span>[1431](#fn_1430.md) …

<span id="ii.XLV-p89"></span>19. “God, Thy God, hath anointed Thee.” We
have been speaking of God, who was “anointed;” i.e. of Christ. The name
of Christ could not be more clearly expressed than by His being called
“God the Anointed.” In the same way in which He was “beautiful before
the children of men,” so is He here “anointed with the oil of gladness
above His fellows.” Who then are His “fellows”? The children of men; for
that He Himself (as the Son of Man) became partaker of their mortality
in order to make them partakers of His Immortality.

<span id="ii.XLV-p90"></span><span id="page_152">p. 152</span> <span
id="ii.XLV-Page_152"></span>20. “Out of Thy garments is the smell of
myrrh, amber, and cassia” ([Psa.
45.8](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#008)<span id="ii.XLV-p90.1"></span>.md).
Out of Thy garments is perceived the smell of fragrant odours. By His
garments are meant His Saints, His elect, His whole Church, which he
shows forth, as His garment, so to speak; His robe “without spot and
wrinkle,” <span id="fr_1431"></span>[1432](#fn_1431.md) which on account of
its spots He has “washed” in His blood; on account of its “wrinkles”
extended on His Cross. Hence the sweet savour which is signified by
certain perfumes there mentioned. Hear Paul, that “least of the
Apostles” (that “hem of that garment,” which the woman with the issue of
blood touched, and was healed), hear him saying: “We are a sweet savour
of Christ, in every place, both in them that are saved, and in them that
perish.”  <span id="fr_1432"></span>[1433](#fn_1432.md) He did not say, “We
are a sweet savour in them that are saved, and a foul savour in them
that are lost:” but, as far as relates to ourselves, “we are a sweet
savour both in them that are saved, and in them that perish.”…They who
loved him were saved by the odour of “sweet savour;” they who envied
him, perished by means of that “sweet savour.” To them that perished
then he was not a foul “savour,” but a “sweet savour.” For it was for
this very reason they the more envied him, the more excellent that grace
was which reigned in him: for no man envies him who is unhappy. He then
was glorious in the preaching of God’s Word, and in regulating his life
according to the rule of that “rod of direction;” and he was loved by
those who loved Christ in him, who followed after and pursued the odour
of sweet savour; who loved the friend of the bridegroom: that is to say,
by the Bride Herself, who says in the Song of Songs,  <span
id="fr_1433"></span>[1434](#fn_1433.md) “We will run after the sweet savour
of thy perfumes.” But the others, the more they beheld him invested with
the glory of the preaching of the Gospel, and of an irreproachable life,
were so much the more tortured with envy, and found that sweet savour
prove death to them.

<span id="ii.XLV-p94"></span>21. “Out of thy ivory palaces, whereby
kings’ daughters have made Thee glad.” Choose whichever you please,
“ivory” palaces, or “magnificent,” or “royal” palaces, it is out of
these that the kings’ daughters have made Christ glad. Would you
understand the spiritual sense of “ivory palaces”? Understand by them
the magnificent houses, and tabernacles of God, the hearts of the
Saints; and by these self-same “kings” those who rule their flesh; who
bring into subjection to themselves the rebellious commonalty of human
affections, who chastise the body, and reduce it to bondage: for it is
from these that the daughters of kings have made Him glad. For all the
souls that have been born through their preaching and evangelizing are
“daughters of kings:” and the Churches, as the daughters of Apostles,
are daughters of kings. For He is “King of kings;” they themselves
kings, of whom it was said, “Ye shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging
the twelve tribes of Israel.” <span id="fr_1434"></span>[1435](#fn_1434.md)
They preached the “Word of Truth;” and begat Churches not for
themselves, but for Him.…Therefore as “raising up seed <span
id="fr_1435"></span>[1436](#fn_1435.md) to their brother,” to as many as
they begat, they gave the name not of “Paulians” or “Petrians,” but of
“Christians.” Observe whether that sense is not wakefully kept <span
id="fr_1436"></span>[1437](#fn_1436.md) in these verses. For when he said,
“out of the ivory palaces, he spake of mansions royal, ample,
honourable, peaceful, like the heart of the Saints; he added, “Whereby
the kings’ daughters have made Thee glad in Thine honour.” They are
indeed daughters of kings, daughters of thine Apostles, but still “in
Thine honour:” for they raised up seed to their brother. Hence Paul,
when he saw those whom he had raised up unto his Brother, running after
his own name, exclaimed, “Was Paul crucified for you?” <span
id="fr_1437"></span>[1438](#fn_1437.md) …No; for he says, “Or were ye
baptized in the name of Paul?”

<span id="ii.XLV-p99"></span>“The daughters of kings have made Thee glad
in Thine honour.” Keep, hold fast this “in Thine honour.” This is meant
by having “a wedding garment;” seeking His honour, His glory. Understand
moreover by “kings’ daughters” the cities, which were founded by kings,
and have received the faith: and out of the ivory palaces (palaces rich,
the proud, the lifted up). “Kings’ daughters have made Thee glad in
Thine honour;” in that they sought not the honour of their founders, but
have sought Thine honour. Show me at Rome a temple of Romulus held in so
great honour as I can show you the Monument of Peter. <span
id="fr_1438"></span>[1439](#fn_1438.md) In Peter, who is honoured but He
who died for us? For we are followers of Christ, not followers of Peter.
And even if we were born from the brother of Him that is dead, yet are
we named after the name of Him who is dead. <span
id="fr_1439"></span>[1440](#fn_1439.md) We were begotten by the one, but
begotten to the other. Behold, Rome, Carthage, and several other cities
are the daughters of kings, and yet have they “made glad the King in His
honour:” and all these make up one single Queen.

<span id="ii.XLV-p102"></span>22. What a nuptial song! Behold in the
midst of songs full of rejoicing, comes forth the Bride herself. For the
Bridegroom was coming. It was He who was being described: it was on Him
all our attention was fixed.

<span id="ii.XLV-p103"></span><span id="page_153">p. 153</span> <span
id="ii.XLV-Page_153"></span>“Upon Thy right hand did stand the Queen”
([Psa. 45.9](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#009.md)<span
id="ii.XLV-p103.1"></span>). She which stands on the left is no Queen.
For there will be one standing on “the left” also, to whom it will be
said, “Go into everlasting fire.” <span
id="fr_1440"></span>[1441](#fn_1440.md) But she shall stand on the right
hand, to whom it will be said, “Come, ye blessed of My Father, inherit
the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.” <span
id="fr_1441"></span>[1442](#fn_1441.md) On Thy right hand did stand the
Queen, “in a vesture of gold, clothed about with divers colours.” What
is the vesture of this Queen? It is one both precious, and also of
divers colours: it is the mysteries of doctrine in all the various
tongues: one African, one Syrian, one Greek, one Hebrew, one this, and
one that; it is these languages that produce the divers colours of this
vesture. <span id="fr_1442"></span>[1443](#fn_1442.md) But just as all the
divers colours of the vesture blend together in the one vesture, so do
all the languages in one and the same faith. In that vesture, let there
be diversity, let there be no rent. See we have “understood” the divers
colours of the diversity of tongues; and the vesture to refer to unity:
but in that diversity itself, what is meant by the “gold”? Wisdom
itself. Let there be any diversity of tongues you please, but there is
but one “gold” that is preached of: not a different gold, but a
different form of that gold. For it is the same Wisdom, the same
doctrine and discipline that every language preaches. In the languages
there is diversity; gold in the thoughts.

<span id="ii.XLV-p107"></span>23. The Prophet addresses this Queen (for
he delights in singing to her), and moreover each one of us, provided,
however, we know where we are, and endeavour to belong to that body, and
do belong to it in faith and hope, being united in the membership of
Christ. <span id="fr_1443"></span>[1444](#fn_1443.md) For it is us whom he
addresses, saying, “Hearken, O daughter, and behold” ([Psa.
45.10](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#010.md)<span
id="ii.XLV-p108.1"></span>), as being one of the “Fathers” (for they are
“daughters of kings”), although it be a Prophet, or although it be an
Apostle <span id="fr_1444"></span>[1445](#fn_1444.md) that is addressing
her; addressing her, as a daughter, for we are accustomed to speak in
this way, “Our fathers the Prophets, our fathers the Apostles;” if we
address them as “fathers,” they may address us as children: and it is
one father’s voice addressing one daughter. “Hearken, O daughter, and
see.” “Hear” first; afterward “see.” For they came to us with the
Gospel; and that has been preached to us, which as yet we do not see,
and which on hearing of it we believed, which by believing it, we shall
come to see: even as the Bridegroom Himself speaks in the Prophet, “A
people whom I have not known served me. In the hearing of me with the
ear it obeyed me.” <span id="fr_1445"></span>[1446](#fn_1445.md) What is
meant by on “hearing of me with the ear”? That they did not “see.” The
Jews saw Him, and crucified Him; the Gentiles saw Him not, and believed.
Let the Queen who comes from the Gentiles come in “the vesture of gold,
clothed with divers colours;” <span id="fr_1446"></span>[1447](#fn_1446.md)
let her come from among the Gentiles clad in all languages, in the unity
of Wisdom: let it be said unto her, “Hearken, O daughter, and see.” If
thou wilt not hear, thou shalt not “see.”…

<span id="ii.XLV-p112"></span>“And incline thine ear.” It is not enough
to “hearken;” hearken with humility: bow down thine ear. “Forget also
thine own people, and thy father’s house.” There was a certain “people,”
and a certain house of thy father, in which thou wast born, the people
of Babylon, having the devil for thy king. Whencesoever the Gentiles
came, they came from their father the devil; but they have renounced
their sonship to the devil. “Forget also thine own people, and thy
father’s house.” He, in making thee a sinner, begat thee loathsome: the
Other, in that “He justifies the ungodly,” <span
id="fr_1447"></span>[1448](#fn_1447.md) begetteth thee again in beauty.

<span id="ii.XLV-p114"></span>24. “For the King hath greatly desired thy
beauty” ([Psa. 45.11](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#011.md)<span
id="ii.XLV-p114.1"></span>). What “beauty” is that, save that which is
His own work? “Greatly desired the beauty”—Of whom? Of her the sinner,
the unrighteous, the ungodly, such as she was with her “father,” the
devil, and among her own “people”? No, but hers of whom it is said, “Who
is this that cometh up made white?” <span
id="fr_1448"></span>[1449](#fn_1448.md) She was not white then at the
first, but was “made” white afterwards. For “though your sins shall be
as scarlet, I will make them white as snow.” <span
id="fr_1449"></span>[1450](#fn_1449.md) “The king has greatly desired thy
beauty.” What King is this? “For He is the Lord thy God.” <span
id="fr_1450"></span>[1451](#fn_1450.md) Now consider whether thou oughtest
not to forego that thy father, and thy own people, and to come to this
King, who is thy God? Thy God is “thy King,” thy “King” is also thy
Bridegroom. Thou weddest to thy King, who is thy God: being endowed by
Him, being adorned by Him; redeemed by Him, and healed by Him. Whatever
thou hast, wherewith to be pleasing to Him, thou hast from Him.

<span id="ii.XLV-p118"></span>25. “And the daughters of Tyre shall
worship Him with gifts” ([Psa.
45.12](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#012.md)<span
id="ii.XLV-p118.1"></span>). It is that selfsame “King, who is thy God,”
that the daughters of Tyre shall worship with gifts. The daughters of
Tyre are the daughters of the Gentiles; the part standing for the whole.
Tyre, a city bordering on this country, where the prophecy was
delivered, typified the nations that were to believe in Christ. Thence
came that <span id="page_154">p. 154</span> <span
id="ii.XLV-Page_154"></span>Canaanitish woman, who was at first called
“a dog;” for that ye may know that she was from thence, the Gospel
speaks thus. “He departed into the parts of Tyre and Sidon, and behold a
woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts,” with all the rest that is
related there. She who at first, at the house of her “father,” and among
her “own people,” was but “a dog,” who by coming to, and crying after
that “King,” was made beautiful by believing in Him, what did she obtain
to hear? “O woman, great is thy faith.” <span
id="fr_1451"></span>[1452](#fn_1451.md) “The King has greatly desired thy
beauty. And the daughters of Tyre shall worship with gifts.” <span
id="fr_1452"></span>[1453](#fn_1452.md) With what gifts? Even so would this
King be approached, and would have His treasuries filled: and it is He
Himself who has given us that wherewith they may be filled, and may be
filled <span id="fr_1453"></span>[1454](#fn_1453.md) by you. Let them come
(He says) and “worship Him with gifts.” What is meant by “with
gifts”?…“Give alms, and all things are clean unto you.” Come with gifts
to Him that saith, “I will have mercy rather than sacrifice.” <span
id="fr_1454"></span>[1455](#fn_1454.md) To that Temple that existed
aforetime as a shadow of that which was to come, they used to come with
bulls, and rams, and goats, with every different kind of animal for
sacrifice: that with that blood one thing should be done, and another be
typified by it. Now that very blood, which all these things used to
figure, hath come: the King Himself hath come, and He Himself would have
your “gifts.” What gifts? Alms. For He Himself will judge hereafter, and
will Himself hereafter account “gifts” to certain persons. “Come” (He
says), “ye blessed of My Father.” Why? “I was an hungred, and ye gave Me
meat,” <span id="fr_1455"></span>[1456](#fn_1455.md) etc. These are the
gifts with which the daughters of Tyre worship the King; for when they
said, “When saw we Thee?” He who is at once above and below (whence
those “ascending” and “descending” are spoken of  <span
id="fr_1456"></span>[1457](#fn_1456) .md), said, “Inasmuch as ye have done
it unto one of the least of Mine, ye have done it unto Me.” <span
id="fr_1457"></span>[1458](#fn_1457.md)

<span id="ii.XLV-p126"></span>26. …“The rich among the people shall
entreat Thy face.” Both they who shall entreat that face, and He whose
face they will entreat, are all collectively but one Bride, but one
Queen, mother and children belonging all together unto Christ, belonging
unto their Head.…

<span id="ii.XLV-p127"></span>27. “All the glory of her, the King’s
daughter, is from within” ([Psa.
45.13](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#013.md)<span
id="ii.XLV-p127.1"></span>). Not only is her robe, outwardly, “of gold,
and of divers colours;” but He who loved her beauty, knew her to be also
beautiful within. <span id="fr_1458"></span>[1459](#fn_1458.md) What are
those inward charms? <span id="fr_1459"></span>[1460](#fn_1459.md) Those of
conscience. It is there Christ sees; it is there Christ loves her: it is
there He addresses her, there punishes, there crowns. Let then thine
alms be done in secret; for “all the glory of her, the King’s daughter,
is from within.” “With fringes of gold, clothed with divers colours”
([Psa. 45.14](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#014.md)<span
id="ii.XLV-p129.1"></span>). Her beauty is from within; yet in the
“fringes of gold” is the diversity of languages: the beauty of doctrine.
What do these avail, if them be not that beauty “from within”? “The
virgins shall be brought unto the King after her.” It has been fulfilled
indeed. The Church has believed; the Church has been formed throughout
all nations. And to what a degree do virgins now seek to find favour in
the eyes of that King! Whence are they moved to do so? Even because the
Church preceded them. “The virgins shall be brought unto the King after
her. Her near kinswomen  <span id="fr_1460"></span>[1461](#fn_1460.md)
shall be brought unto Thee.” For they that are brought unto Him are not
strangers, but her “near kinswomen,” that belong to her. And because he
had said, “unto the King,” he says, turning the discourse to Him, “her
near kinswomen shall be brought unto Thee.”

<span id="ii.XLV-p131"></span>28. “With gladness and rejoicing shall
they be brought and shall be led into the Temple of the King” ([Psa.
45.15](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#015.md)<span
id="ii.XLV-p131.1"></span>). The “Temple of the King” is the Church
itself: it is the Church itself that enters into “the Temple of the
King.” Whereof is that Temple constructed? Of the men who enter the
Temple? Who but God’s “faithful” ones are its “living stones”? <span
id="fr_1461"></span>[1462](#fn_1461.md) “They shall be led into the Temple
of the King.” For there are virgins without the Temple of the King, the
nuns among the heretics: <span id="fr_1462"></span>[1463](#fn_1462.md) they
are virgins, it is true; but what will that profit them, unless they be
led into the “Temple of the King”? The “Temple of the King” is in unity:
the “Temple of the King” is not ruinous, is not rent asunder, is not
divided. The cement <span id="fr_1463"></span>[1464](#fn_1463.md) of those
living stones is “charity.”

<span id="ii.XLV-p135"></span>29. “Instead of thy fathers, children are
born to thee” ([Psa. 45.16](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#016.md)<span
id="ii.XLV-p135.1"></span>). Nothing can be more manifest. Now consider
the “Temple of the King” itself, for it is on its behalf he speaks, on
account of the unity of the body that is spread throughout all the
world: for those very persons who have chosen to be virgins, cannot find
favour with the King unless they be led into the Temple of the King.
“Instead of thy fathers, are thy children born to thee.” It was the
Apostles begat thee: they were “sent:” they were the preachers: they are
“the fathers.” <span id="page_155">p. 155</span> <span
id="ii.XLV-Page_155"></span>But was it possible for them to be with us
in the body for ever? Although one of them said, “I desire to depart,
and to be with Christ, which is far better: to abide in the flesh is
necessary for your sakes.” It is true he said this, but how long was it
possible for him to remain here? Could it be till this present time,
could it be to all futurity? Is the Church then left desolate by their
departure? God forbid. “Instead of thy fathers, children have been born
to thee.” What is that? The Apostles were sent to thee as “fathers,”
instead of the Apostles sons have been born to thee: there have been
appointed Bishops. For in the present day, whence do the Bishops,
throughout all the world, derive their origin? The Church itself calls
them fathers; the Church itself brought them forth, and placed them on
the thrones of “the fathers.” Think not thyself abandoned then, because
thou seest not Peter, nor seest Paul: seest not those through whom thou
wert born. Out of thine own offspring has a body of “fathers” been
raised up to thee. “Instead of thy fathers, have children been born to
thee.” Observe how widely diffused is the “Temple of the King,” that
“the virgins that are not led to the Temple of the King,” may know that
they have nothing to do with that marriage. “Thou shalt make them
princes <span id="fr_1464"></span>[1465](#fn_1464.md) over all the earth.”
This is the Universal Church: her children have been made “princes over
all the earth:” her children have been appointed instead of the
“fathers.” Let those who are cut off own the truth of this, let them
come to the One Body: let them be led into the Temple of the King. God
hath established His Temple everywhere: hath laid everywhere “the
foundations of the Prophets and Apostles.” <span
id="fr_1465"></span>[1466](#fn_1465.md) The Church has brought “forth
sons;” has made them “instead of her fathers” to be “princes over all
the earth.”

<span id="ii.XLV-p138"></span>30. “They shall be mindful of thy name in
every generation and generation; therefore shall the peoples confess
unto <span id="fr_1466"></span>[1467](#fn_1466.md) Thee” ([Psa.
45.17](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#017.md)<span
id="ii.XLV-p139.1"></span>). What does it profit then to “confess”
indeed and yet to confess out of “the Temple”? What does it profit to
pray, and yet not to pray on the Mount? “I cried,” says he, “unto the
Lord with my voice: and He heard me out of His holy hill.” <span
id="fr_1467"></span>[1468](#fn_1467.md) Out of what “hill”? Out of that of
which it is said, “A city set upon a hill cannot be hid.” <span
id="fr_1468"></span>[1469](#fn_1468.md) Of what “hill”? Out of that hill
which Daniel saw “grow out of a small stone, and break all the kingdoms
of the earth; and cover all the face of the earth.” <span
id="fr_1469"></span>[1470](#fn_1469.md) There let him pray, who hopes to
receive: there let him ask, who would have his prayer heard: there let
him confess, who wishes to be pardoned. “Therefore shall the peoples
confess unto thee for ever, world without end.” For in that eternal life
it is true indeed there will no longer be the mourning over sins: but
yet in the praises of God by that everlasting City which is above, there
will not be wanting a perpetual confession of the greatness of that
happiness. For to that City itself, to which another Psalm <span
id="fr_1470"></span>[1471](#fn_1470.md) sings, “Glorious things are spoken
of thee, O City of God,” to her who is the very Bride of Christ, the
very Queen, a “King’s daughter, and a King’s consort;”…the peoples shall
for this very cause confess even to herself; the hearts of all, now
enlightened by perfect charity, being laid bare, and made manifest, that
she may know the whole of herself most completely, who here is, in many
parts of her, unknown to herself.…
