<span id="ii.CXIX.i-p1"></span> <span id="ii.CXIX.i-p1.1"></span><span
class="c20"><span id="ii.CXIX.i-p1.2"></span>Psalm CXIX. <span
id="fr_5127"></span>[5128](#fn_5127.md) </span>

<span id="ii.CXIX.i-p3"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="ii.CXIX.i-p3.1"></span>Aleph.</span>

<span id="ii.CXIX.i-p4"></span>1. From its commencement, dearly beloved,
doth this great Psalm exhort us unto bliss, which there is no one who
desireth not.…And therefore this is the lesson which he teacheth, who
saith, “Blessed are those that are undefiled in the way, who walk in the
law of the Lord” ([Psa. 119.1](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#001.md)<span
id="ii.CXIX.i-p4.1"></span>). As much as to say, I know what thou
wishest, thou art seeking bliss: if then thou wouldest be blessed, be
undefiled. For the former all desire, the latter fear: yet without it
what all wish cannot be attained. But where will any one be undefiled,
save in the way? In what way, save in the law of the Lord?…

<span id="ii.CXIX.i-p5"></span>2. Listen now to what he addeth: “Blessed
are they that keep His testimonies, and seek Him with their whole heart”
([Psa. 119.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#002.md)<span
id="ii.CXIX.i-p5.1"></span>). No other class of the blessed seemeth to
me to be mentioned in these words, than that which has been already
spoken of. For to examine into the testimonies of the Lord, and to seek
Him with all the heart, this is to be undefiled in the way, this is to
walk in the law of the Lord. He then goeth on to say, “For they who do
wickedness, shall not walk in His ways” ([Psa.
119.3](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#003.md)<span
id="ii.CXIX.i-p5.2"></span>). And yet we know that the workers of
wickedness do search the testimonies of the Lord for this reason, that
they prefer being learned to being righteous: we know that others also
search the testimonies of the Lord, not because they are already living
well, but that they may know how they ought to live. Such then do not as
yet walk undefiled in the law of the Lord, and for this reason are not
as yet blessed.…

<span id="ii.CXIX.i-p6"></span>3. It is written, and is read, and is
true, in this Psalm, that “They who do wickedness, walk not in His ways”
([Psa. 119.3](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#003.md)<span
id="ii.CXIX.i-p6.1"></span>). But we must endeavour, with the help of
God, “in” whose “hand are both we and our words,” <span
id="fr_5128"></span>[5129](#fn_5128.md) that what is rightly said, by not
being rightly understood, may not confuse the reader or hearer. For we
must beware, lest all the Saints, whose words these are, “If we say that
we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us;” <span
id="fr_5129"></span>[5130](#fn_5129.md) may either not be thought to walk
in the ways of the Lord, since sin is wickedness, and “they who do
wickedness, walk not in His ways;” or, because it is not doubtful that
they walk in the ways of the Lord, may be thought to have no sin, which
is beyond doubt false. For it is not said merely for the sake of
avoiding arrogance and pride. Otherwise it would not be added, “And the
truth is not in us;” but it would be said, Humility is not in us:
especially because the following words throw a clearer light on the
meaning, and remove all the causes of doubt. For when the blessed John
had said this, he added, “If we confess our sins, He is faithful and
just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all
unrighteousness.” <span id="fr_5130"></span>[5131](#fn_5130.md) …

<span id="ii.CXIX.i-p10"></span>4. What meaneth, “Thou hast charged that
we shall keep Thy commandments too much”? ([Psa.
119.4](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#004.md)<span
id="ii.CXIX.i-p10.1"></span>). Is it, “Thou hast charged too much”? or,
“to keep too much”? Whichever of these we understand, the sense seems
contrary to that memorable and noble sentiment which the Greeks praise
in their wise men, and which the Latins agree in praising. “Do nothing
too much.” <span id="fr_5131"></span>[5132](#fn_5131.md) …But the Latin
language some<span id="page_561">p. 561</span> <span
id="ii.CXIX.i-Page_561"></span>times uses the word *nimis* in such a
sense, that we find it in the holy Scripture, and employ it in our
discourses, as signifying, very much. In this passage, “Thou hast
charged that we keep Thy commandments too much,” we simply understand
very much, if we understand rightly; and if we say to any very dear
friend, I love you too much, we do not wish to be understood to mean
more than is fitting, but very much.

<span id="ii.CXIX.i-p12"></span>5. “O that,” he saith, “my ways were
made so direct, that I might keep Thy statutes” ([Psa.
119.5](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#005.md)<span
id="ii.CXIX.i-p12.1"></span>). Thou indeed hast charged: O that I could
realize what thou hast charged. When thou hearest, “O that,” recognise
the words of one wishing; and having recognised the expression of a
wish, lay aside the pride of presumption. For who saith that he desireth
what he hath in such a manner in his power, that without need of any
help he can do it? Therefore if man desireth what God chargeth, God must
be prayed to grant Himself what He enjoineth.…

<span id="ii.CXIX.i-p13"></span>6. “So shall I not be confounded, while
I have respect unto all Thy commandments” ([Psa.
119.6](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#006.md)<span
id="ii.CXIX.i-p13.1"></span>). We ought to look upon the commandments of
God, whether when they are read, or when they are recalled to memory, as
a looking-glass, as the Apostle James saith. <span
id="fr_5132"></span>[5133](#fn_5132.md) This man wisheth himself to be
such, that he may regard as in a mirror the commandments of God, and may
not be confounded; because he chooses not merely to be a hearer of them,
but a doer. On this account he desireth that his ways may be made direct
to keep the statutes of God. How to be made direct, save by the grace of
God? Otherwise he will find in the law of God not a source of rejoicing,
but of confusion, if he hath chosen to look into commandments, which he
doth not.

<span id="ii.CXIX.i-p15"></span>7. “I will confess unto Thee,” he saith,
“O Lord, in the directing of my heart; in that I shall have learned the
judgments of Thy righteousness” ([Psa.
119.7](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#007.md)<span
id="ii.CXIX.i-p15.1"></span>). This is not the confession of sins, but
of praise; as He also saith in whom there was no sin, “I will confess
unto Thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth;” <span
id="fr_5133"></span>[5134](#fn_5133.md) and as it is written in the Book of
Ecclesiasticus, “Thus shalt thou say in confession, of all the works of
God, that they are very good.” <span
id="fr_5134"></span>[5135](#fn_5134.md) “I will confess unto Thee,” he
saith, “in the directing of my heart.” Indeed, if my ways are made
straight, I will confess unto Thee, since Thou hast done it, and this is
Thy praise, and not mine.…

<span id="ii.CXIX.i-p18"></span>8. Next he addeth: “I will keep Thy
ordinances” ([Psa. 119.8](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#008.md)<span
id="ii.CXIX.i-p18.1"></span>).…But what is it that followeth? “O forsake
me not even exceedingly!” or, as some copies have it, “even too much,”
instead of, “even exceedingly.” <span
id="fr_5135"></span>[5136](#fn_5135.md) But since God had left the world to
the desert of sins, He would have forsaken it “even exceedingly,” if so
powerful a cure had not supported it, that is, the grace of God through
our Lord Jesus Christ; but now, according to this prayer of the body of
Christ, He forsook it not “even exceedingly;” for, “God was in Christ,
reconciling the world unto Himself.” <span
id="fr_5136"></span>[5137](#fn_5136.md) …

<span id="ii.CXIX.i-p2"></span> Lat. CXVIII. \[The author says:
“Preface.—I have expounded all the rest of the Psalms, which we know the
Book of the Psalms containeth, which by the custom of the Church is
styled the Psalter, partly by preaching among the people, partly by
dictations, as well as I, by the Lord’s help, was able: but I put off
the CXIXth Psalm, as well on account of its well-known length, as on
account of its depth being fathomable by few. And when my brethren
deeply regretted that the exposition of this Psalm alone, so far as
pertaineth to the Psalms of the same volume, was wanting to my works,
and strongly pressed me to pay this debt, I yielded not to them, though
they long entreated and solicited me; because as often as I began to
reflect upon it, it always exceeded the utmost stretch of my powers. For
in proportion as it seemeth more open, so much the more deep doth it
appear to me; so that I cannot show how deep it is. For in others, which
are understood with difficulty, although the sense lie hid in obscurity,
yet the obscurity itself appeareth; but in this, not even this is the
case; since it is superficially such, that it seemeth not to need an
expositor, but only a reader and listener. And now that at length I
approach its interpretation, I am utterly ignorant what I can achieve in
it: nevertheless, I hope that God will aid me with His Presence, that I
may effect something. For thus He hath done in all those which, though
at first they seemed to me difficult, and almost impracticable, I have
succeeded in adequately expounding. But I decided to do this by means of
sermons, which might be delivered among the people, such as the Greeks
term <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.CXIX.i-p2.1"></span>ὁμιλίαι</span>. For this is, I think, more
equitable, that the assemblies of the Church be not defrauded of the
comprehension of this Psalm, by the singing of which, as much as by that
of others, they are wont to be charmed. But let the preface end here: we
must now speak of the Psalm itself, to which we have thought it right to
make this Preface.”—C.\]
