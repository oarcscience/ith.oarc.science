<span id="ii.CXIV-p1"></span> <span id="ii.CXIV-p1.1"></span><span
class="c20"><span id="ii.CXIV-p1.2"></span>Psalm CXIV. <span
id="fr_5036"></span>[5037](#fn_5036.md) </span>

<span id="ii.CXIV-p3"></span>1. The river Jordan, when they were
entering across it into the land of promise, when touched by the feet of
the priests who bore the Ark, stood still from above with bridled
stream, while it flowed down from below, where it ran on into the sea,
until the whole people passed over, the <span id="page_550">p.
550</span> <span id="ii.CXIV-Page_550"></span>priests standing on the
dry ground. <span id="fr_5037"></span>[5038](#fn_5037.md) We know these
things, but yet we should not imagine in this Psalm, to which we have
now answered by chanting Allelujah, that it is the purpose of the Holy
Spirit, that while we call to mind those deeds of the past, we should
not consider things like unto them yet to take place. For “these
things,” as the Apostle saith, “happened unto them for ensamples.” <span
id="fr_5038"></span>[5039](#fn_5038.md)

<span id="ii.CXIV-p6"></span>2. “When Israel came out of Egypt, and the
house of Jacob from among the strange people” ([Psa.
114.1](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#001)<span id="ii.CXIV-p6.1"></span>.md),
“Judah was His sanctuary, and Israel His dominion” ([Psa.
114.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#002)<span id="ii.CXIV-p6.2"></span>.md);
“the sea saw that and fled, Jordan was driven back” ([Psa.
114.3](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#003)<span id="ii.CXIV-p6.3"></span>.md).
Think not that past deeds are related unto us, but rather that the
future is predicted; since, while those miracles also were going on in
that people, things present indeed were happening, but not without an
intimation of things future.…Some things he has related differently to
what we have learnt and read there: that he might not truly be thought
to be repeating past acts rather than to be prophesying future things.
For in the first place, we read not that the Jordan was driven back, but
that it stood still on the side nearest the source of its streams, while
the people were passing through; next, we read not of the mountains and
hills skipping: all which he hath added, and repeated. For after saying,
“The sea saw that, and fled; Jordan was driven back:” he added, “The
mountains skipped like rams, and the little hills like young sheep”
([Psa. 114.4](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#004.md)<span
id="ii.CXIV-p6.4"></span>): and then asketh, “What aileth thee, O thou
sea, that thou fleddest: and thou, Jordan, that thou wast driven back?”
([Psa. 114.5](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#005.md)<span
id="ii.CXIV-p6.5"></span>). “Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams;
and ye little hills, like young sheep?” ([Psa.
114.6](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#006)<span id="ii.CXIV-p6.6"></span>.md).

<span id="ii.CXIV-p7"></span>3. Let us therefore consider what we are
taught here; since both those deeds were typical of us, and these words
exhort us to recognise ourselves. For if we hold with a firm heart the
grace of God which hath been given us, we are Israel, the seed of
Abraham: unto us the Apostle saith, “Therefore are ye the seed of
Abraham.” <span id="fr_5039"></span>[5040](#fn_5039.md) …Let therefore no
Christian consider himself alien to the name of Israel. For we are
joined in the corner stone with those among the Jews who believed, among
whom we find the Apostles chief. Hence our Lord in another passage
saith, “And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold; them also I
must bring, that there may be one fold and one Shepherd.” <span
id="fr_5040"></span>[5041](#fn_5040.md) The Christian people then is rather
Israel, and the same is preferably the house of Jacob; for Israel and
Jacob are the same. But that multitude of Jews, which was deservedly
reprobated for its perfidy, for the pleasures of the flesh sold their
birthright, so that they belonged not to Jacob, but rather to Esau. For
ye know that it was said with this hidden meaning, “That the elder shall
serve the younger.” <span id="fr_5041"></span>[5042](#fn_5041.md)

<span id="ii.CXIV-p11"></span>4. But Egypt, since it is said to mean
affliction, or one who afflicteth, or one who oppresseth, is often used
for an emblem of this world; from which we must spiritually withdraw,
that we may not be bearing the yoke with unbelievers. <span
id="fr_5042"></span>[5043](#fn_5042.md) For thus each one becometh a fit
citizen of the heavenly Jerusalem, when he hath first renounced this
world; just as that people could not be led into the land of promise,
save first they had departed from Egypt. But as they did not depart
thence, until freed by Divine help; so no man is turned away in heart
from this world, unless aided by the gift of the Divine mercy. For what
was there once prefigured, the same is fulfilled in every faithful one
in the daily travailings of the Church, in this end of the world, in
this, as the blessed John writeth, last time. <span
id="fr_5043"></span>[5044](#fn_5043.md) Hear the Apostle the teacher of the
Gentiles, thus instructing us: “I would not, brethren, that ye should be
ignorant, how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed
through the sea; and were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in
the sea, and did all eat the same spiritual meat, and did all drink the
same spiritual drink; for they drank of that spiritual rock that
followed them, and that rock was Christ. But with many of them God was
not well pleased, for they were overthrown in the wilderness. Now these
things were our examples.” <span id="fr_5044"></span>[5045](#fn_5044.md)
What more do ye wish, most beloved brethren? For it is surely clear, not
from human conjecture, but from the declaration of an Apostle, that is,
of God and our Lord: for God spoke in them, and though from clouds of
flesh, yet it was God who thundered: surely then it is clear by so great
testimony that all these things which were done in figure, are now
fulfilled in our salvation; because then the future was predicted, now
the past is read, and the present observed.

<span id="ii.CXIV-p15"></span>5. Hear what is even more wonderful, that
the hidden and veiled mysteries of the ancient books are in some degree
revealed by the ancient books. For Micah the prophet speaketh thus.
“According to the days of thy coming out of Egypt will I show unto him
marvellous things, etc. <span id="fr_5045"></span>[5046](#fn_5045.md) …In
this Psalm, therefore, although the wonderful spirit of prophecy doth
look into the future, yet it seemeth, as it were, to be merely detailing
to the past. “Judah,” he saith, “was His sanctuary: the sea saw that and
fled:” “was,” “saw,” and “fled,” are words of the past tense; and
“Jordan was driven back, and the mountains skipped, and the earth
trembled,” in like manner have a past expression, without, however, any
difficulty in understanding by them the <span id="page_551">p.
551</span> <span id="ii.CXIV-Page_551"></span>future.…For though it was
so long after the departure of that people from Egypt, and so long
before these seasons of the Church, that he sang what I have quoted;
nevertheless, he witnesseth that he is foretelling the future without
any question. “According to the days,” he saith, “of thy coming out of
the land of Egypt will I show unto him marvellous things.” “The nations
shall see and be confounded.” This is what is here said, “The sea saw
that, and fled:” for if in this passage, through words of the past tense
the future is secretly revealed, as is the case; who would venture to
explain the words, “shall see and be confounded,” of past events? And a
little lower down he <span id="fr_5046"></span>[5047](#fn_5046.md) alludeth
more clearly than light itself to those very enemies of ours, who
followed us flying, that they might slay us, that is, our sins, which
are overwhelmed and extinguished in Baptism, just as the Egyptians were
drowned in the sea, saying, since “He retaineth not His anger for ever,
because He is of good will and merciful, He will turn again, He will
have compassion upon us, He will drown our iniquities: and Thou wilt
cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.”

<span id="ii.CXIV-p18"></span>6. What is it, most beloved? ye who know
yourselves to be Israelites according to Abraham’s seed, ye who are of
the house of Jacob, heirs according to promise, know that even ye have
gone forth from Egypt, since ye have renounced this world; that ye have
gone forth from a foreign people, since by the confession of piety, ye
have separated yourselves from the blasphemies of the Gentiles. For it
is not your tongue, but a foreign one, which knoweth not how to praise
God, to whom ye sing Allelujah. For “Judah” hath become “His sanctuary”
in you; for “he is not a Jew which is one outwardly; neither is that
circumcision, which is outward in the flesh; but he is a Jew which is
one inwardly, and by circumcision of the heart.” <span
id="fr_5047"></span>[5048](#fn_5047.md) Examine then your hearts, if faith
hath circumcised them, if confession hath cleansed them; in you “Judah”
hath become “His sanctuary,” in you “Israel” hath become “His dominion.”
For “He gave” unto you “the power to become the sons of God.” <span
id="fr_5048"></span>[5049](#fn_5048.md) …

<span id="ii.CXIV-p21"></span>7. But I would not that ye should seek
without yourselves, how the Jordan was turned back, I would not ye
should augur anything evil. For the Lord chideth those who have “turned”
their “back” unto Him, “and not their face.” <span
id="fr_5049"></span>[5050](#fn_5049.md) And whoever forsaketh the source of
his being, and turneth away from his Creator; as a river into the sea,
he glides into the bitter wickedness of this world. It is therefore good
for him that he turn back, and that God whom he had set behind his back,
may be before his face as he returneth; and that the sea of this world,
which he had set before his face, when he was gliding on towards it, may
become behind him; and that he may so forget what is behind him, that he
may “reach forward to what is before him;” <span
id="fr_5050"></span>[5051](#fn_5050.md) which is profitable for him when
once converted.…

<span id="ii.CXIV-p24"></span>8. “Tremble, thou earth, at the presence
of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob” ([Psa.
114.7](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#007.md)<span
id="ii.CXIV-p24.1"></span>). What meaneth, “at the presence of the
Lord,” save at the presence of Him who said, “Lo, I am with you alway,
even unto the end of the world.” <span
id="fr_5051"></span>[5052](#fn_5051.md) For the earth trembled; but because
it had remained slothful, it was made to tremble, so that it might be
more firmly fixed at the presence of the Lord.

<span id="ii.CXIV-p26"></span>9. “Who turned the hard rock into standing
waters, and the flint stone into springing wells” ([Psa.
114.8](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#008.md)<span
id="ii.CXIV-p26.1"></span>). For He melted Himself, and what may be
called His hardness to water those who believe on Him, that He might in
them become “a fountain of water gushing forth unto everlasting
life;” <span id="fr_5052"></span>[5053](#fn_5052.md) because formerly, when
He was not known, He seemed hard. Hence they who said, “This is an hard
saying, who can bear it?” <span id="fr_5053"></span>[5054](#fn_5053.md)
were confounded, and waited not until He should flow and stream upon
them when the Scriptures were revealed. The rock, that hardness, was
turned into pools of water, that stone into fountains of waters, when on
His resurrection, “He expounded unto them, commencing with Moses and all
the prophets, how Christ ought to suffer thus;” <span
id="fr_5054"></span>[5055](#fn_5054.md) and sent the Holy Ghost, of whom He
said, “If any man thirst, let him come unto Me, and drink.” <span
id="fr_5055"></span>[5056](#fn_5055.md)
