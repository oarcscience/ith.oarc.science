##  Book II.

Handmaids of the living God, my fellow-servants and sisters, the right
which I enjoy with you-I, the most meanest<sup>[1](footnote/fn3.md)</sup>
in that right of fellow-servantship and brotherhood-emboldens me to
address to you a discourse, not, of course, of affection, but paving the
way for affection in the cause of your salvation. That salvation-and not
(the salvation) of women only, but likewise of men-consists in the
exhibition principally of modesty. For since, by the introduction into
an appropriation<sup>[2](footnote/fn3.htm#P356_73750)</sup> (in.md) us of
the Holy Spirit, we are all" the temple of
God,"<sup>[3](footnote/fn3.htm#P357_73825.md)</sup> Modesty is the
sacristan and priestess of that temple, who is to suffer nothing unclean
or profane to be introduced (into it), for fear that the God who
inhabits it should be offended, and quite forsake the polluted abode.
But on the present occasion we (are to speak) not about modesty, for the
enjoining and exacting of which the divine precepts which press (upon
us) on every side are sufficient; but about the matters which pertain to
it, that is, the manner in which it behoves you to walk. For most women
(which very thing I trust God may permit me, with a view, of course, to
my own personal censure, to censure in all), either from simple
ignorance or else from dissimulation, have the hardihood so to walk as
if modesty consisted only<sup>[4](footnote/fn3.htm#P358_74608.md)</sup> in
the (bare) integrity of the flesh, and in turning away from (actual)
fornication; and there were no need for anything extrinsic to boot-in
the matter (I mean) of the arrangement of dress and
ornament,<sup>[5](footnote/fn3.htm#P359_74838.md)</sup> the studied graces
of form and brilliance:-wearing in their gait the self-same appearance
as the women of the nations, from whom the sense of *true* modesty is
absent, because in those who know not God, the Guardian and Master of
truth, there is *nothing*
true.<sup>[6](footnote/fn3.htm#P360_75169.md)</sup> For if any modesty can
be believed (to exist) in Gentiles, it is plain that it must be
imperfect and undisciplined to such a degree that, although it be
actively tenacious of itself in the *mind* up to a certain point, it yet
allows itself to relax into licentious extravagances of attire; just in
accordance with Gentile perversity, in craving after that of which it
carefully shuns the effect.<sup>[7](footnote/fn3.htm#P361_75588.md)</sup>
How many a one, in short, is there who does not earnestly desire even to
look pleasing to strangers? who does not on that very account take care
to have herself painted out, and denies that she has (ever) been an
object of (carnal) appetite? And yet, granting that even this is a
practice familiar to Gentile modesty-(namely, ) not actually to *commit*
the sin, but still to be *willing* to do so; or even not to be
*willing*, yet still not quite to refuse-what wonder? for all things
which are not God's are perverse. Let those women therefore look to it,
who, by not holding fast the *whole* good, easily mingle with evil even
what they do hold fast. Necessary it is that *you* turn aside from them,
as in all other things, so also in your gait; since you ought to be
"perfect, as (is) your Father who is in the
heavens."<sup>[8](footnote/fn3.htm#P362_76423.md)</sup>

You must know that in the eye of perfect, that is, Christian, modesty,
(carnal) desire of one's self (on the part of others) is not only not to
be desired, but even execrated, by you: first, because the study of
making personal grace (which we know to be naturally the inviter of
lust) a mean of pleasing does not spring from a sound conscience: why
therefore excite toward yourself that evil (passion)? why invite (that)
to which you profess yourself a stranger? secondly, because we ought not
to open a way to temptations, which, by their instancy, sometimes
achieve (a wickedness) which God expels from them who are His; (or, ) at
all events, put the spirit into a thorough tumult by (presenting) a
stumbling-block (to it). We ought indeed to walk so holily, and with so
entire substantiality<sup>[9](footnote/fn3.htm#P366_77486.md)</sup> of
faith, as to be confident and secure in regard of our own conscience,
*desiring* that that (gift) may abide in us to the end, yet not
*presuming* (that it will). For he who presumes feels less apprehension;
he who feels less apprehension takes less precaution; he who takes less
precaution runs more risk.
Fear<sup>[10](footnote/fn3.htm#P367_77874.md)</sup> is the foundation of
salvation; presumption is an impediment to fear. More useful, then, is
it to apprehend that we may possibly fail, than to presume that we
cannot; for apprehending will lead us to fear, fearing to caution, and
caution to salvation. On the other hand, if we presume, there will be
neither fear nor caution to save us. He who acts securely, and not at
the same time warily, possesses no safe and firm security; whereas he
who is wary will be truly able to be secure. For His own servants, may
the Lord by His mercy take care that to *them* it may be lawful even to
*presume* on His goodness! But why are we a (source of) danger to our
neighbour? why do we import concupiscence into our neighbour? which
concupiscence, if God, in "amplifying the
law,"<sup>[11](footnote/fn3.htm#P368_78651.md)</sup> do
not<sup>[12](footnote/fn3.htm#P369_78753.md)</sup> dissociate in (the way
of) penalty from the actual commission of
fornication,<sup>[13](footnote/fn3.htm#P370_78901.md)</sup> I know not
whether He allows impunity to him
who<sup>[14](footnote/fn3.htm#P371_79024.md)</sup> has been the cause of
perdition to some other. For that other, as soon as he has felt
concupiscence after your beauty, and has mentally already committed (the
deed) which his concupiscence pointed
to,<sup>[15](footnote/fn3.htm#P372_79258.md)</sup> perishes; and you have
been made<sup>[16](footnote/fn3.htm#P373_79334.md)</sup> the sword which
destroys him: so that, albeit you be free from the (actual) crime, you
are not free from the odium (attaching to it); as, when a robbery has
been committed on some man's estate, the (actual) crime indeed will not
be laid to the owner's charge, while yet the domain is branded with
ignominy, (and) the owner himself aspersed with the infamy. Are we to
paint ourselves out that our neighbours may perish? Where, then, is (the
command), "Thou shall love thy neighbour as thyself?
"<sup>[17](footnote/fn3.htm#P374_79847.md)</sup> "Care not merely about
your own (things), but (about your) neighbour's?
"<sup>[18](footnote/fn3.htm#P375_80029.md)</sup> No enunciation of the Holy
Spirit ought to be (confined) to the subject immediately in hand merely,
and not applied and carried out with a view to *every* occasion to which
its application is useful.<sup>[19](footnote/fn3.htm#P376_80274.md)</sup>
Since, therefore, both our own interest and that of others is implicated
in the studious pursuit of most perilous (outward) comeliness, it is
time for you to know<sup>[20](footnote/fn3.htm#P377_80462.md)</sup> that
not merely must the pageantry of fictitious and elaborate beauty be
rejected by you; but that of even natural grace must be obliterated by
concealment and negligence, as equally dangerous to the glances of (the
beholder's) eyes. For, albeit comeliness is not to be
*censured*,<sup>[21](footnote/fn3.htm#P378_80762.md)</sup> as being a
bodily happiness, as being an additional outlay of the divine plastic
art, as being a kind of goodly
garment<sup>[22](footnote/fn3.htm#P379_80899.md)</sup> of the soul; yet it
is to be *feared*, just on account of the injuriousness and violence of
suitors:<sup>[23](footnote/fn3.htm#P380_81025.md)</sup> which
(injuriousness and violence) even the father of the
faith,<sup>[24](footnote/fn3.htm#P381_81108.md)</sup>
Abraham,<sup>[25](footnote/fn3.htm#P382_81145.md)</sup> greatly feared in
regard of his own wife's grace; and
Isaac,<sup>[26](footnote/fn3.htm#P383_81236.md)</sup> by falsely
representing Rebecca as his sister, purchased safety by
insult!<sup>[27](footnote/fn3.htm#P384_81334.md)</sup>

Let it now be granted that excellence of form be not to be feared, as
neither troublesome to its possessors, nor destructive to its desirers,
nor perilous to its
compartners;<sup>[28](footnote/fn3.htm#P388_81705.md)</sup> let it be
thought (to be) not exposed to temptations, not surrounded by
stumbling-blocks: it is enough that to angels of
God<sup>[29](footnote/fn3.htm#P389_81847.md)</sup> it is not necessary.
For, where modesty is, there beauty is idle; because properly the use
and fruit of beauty is voluptuousness, unless any one thinks that there
is some other harvest for bodily grace to
reap.<sup>[30](footnote/fn3.htm#P390_82116.md)</sup> Are women who think
that, in furnishing to their *neighbour* that which is demanded of
beauty, they are furnishing it to *themselves* also, to augment that
(beauty) when (naturally) given them, and to strive after it when not
(thus) given? Some one will say, "Why, then, if voluptuousness be shut
out and chastity let in, may (we) not enjoy the praise of beauty alone,
and glory in a bodily good? "Let whoever finds pleasure in "glorying in
the flesh"<sup>[31](footnote/fn3.htm#P391_82596.md)</sup> see to that. To
us in the first place, there is no studious pursuit of "glory," because
"glory" is the essence of *exaltation*. Now *exaltation* is incongruous
for professors of *humility* according to God's precepts. Secondly, if
*all* "glory" is "vain" and
insensate,<sup>[32](footnote/fn3.htm#P392_82905.md)</sup> how much more
(glory) *in the flesh*, especially to *us*? For even if "glorying" is
(allowable), we ought to wish our sphere of pleasing to lie in the
graces<sup>[33](footnote/fn3.htm#P393_83075.md)</sup> of the Spirit, not in
the flesh; because we are
"suitors"<sup>[34](footnote/fn3.htm#P394_83145.md)</sup> of things
spiritual. In those things wherein our sphere of labour lies, let our
joy lie. From the sources whence we hope for salvation, let us cull our
"glory." Plainly, a Christian *will* "glory" even in the *flesh*; but
(it will be) when it has endured laceration for Christ's
sake,<sup>[35](footnote/fn3.htm#P395_83443.md)</sup> in order that the
spirit may be crowned in it, not in order that it may draw the eyes and
sighs of youths after it. Thus (a thing) which, from whatever point you
look at it, is in *your* case superfluous, you may justly disdain if you
have it not, and neglect if you have. Let a holy woman, if naturally
beautiful, give none so great occasion (for carnal appetite). Certainly,
if even she be so, she ought not to set off (her beauty), but even to
obscure it.<sup>[36](footnote/fn3.htm#P396_83952.md)</sup>

As if I were speaking to Gentiles, addressing you with a Gentile
precept, and (one which is) common to all, (I would say, ) "You are
bound to please your husbands only."<sup>[37](footnote/fn4.md)</sup> But
you will please *them* in proportion as you take no care to please
*others*. Be ye without
carefulness,<sup>[38](footnote/fn4.htm#P401_84357.md)</sup> blessed
(sisters): no wife is "ugly" to her own husband. She "pleased" him
enough when she was selected (by him as his wife); whether commended by
form or by character. Let none of you think that, if she abstain from
the care of her person,<sup>[39](footnote/fn4.htm#P402_84625.md)</sup> she
will incur the hatred and aversion of husbands. Every husband is the
exactor of *chastity*; but *beauty*, a believing (husband) does not
require, because we are not captivated by the same
graces<sup>[40](footnote/fn4.htm#P403_84843.md)</sup> which the Gentiles
think (to be) graces:<sup>[41](footnote/fn4.htm#P404_84896.md)</sup> an
unbelieving one, on the other hand, even regards with suspicion, just
from that infamous opinion of us which the Gentiles have. For whom,
then, is it that you cherish your beauty? If for a believer, he does not
exact it: if for an unbeliever, he does not believe in it unless it be
artless.<sup>[42](footnote/fn4.htm#P405_85201.md)</sup> Why are you eager
to please either one who is suspicious, or else one who desires it not?

These suggestions are not made to you, of course, to be developed into
an entire crudity and wildness of appearance; nor are we seeking to
persuade you of the good of squalor and slovenliness; but of the limit
and norm and just measure of cultivation of the person. There must be no
overstepping of that line to which simple and sufficient refinements
limit their desires-that line which is pleasing to God. For they who
rub<sup>[43](footnote/fn4.htm#P409_85851.md)</sup> their skin with
medicaments, stain their cheeks with rouge, make their eyes prominent
with antimony,<sup>[44](footnote/fn4.htm#P410_85988.md)</sup> sin against
Him. To them, I suppose, the plastic
skill<sup>[45](footnote/fn4.htm#P411_86092.md)</sup> of God is displeasing!
In their own persons, I suppose, they convict, they censure, the
Artificer of all things! For censure they, do when they amend, when they
add to, (His work; ) taking these their additions, of course, from the
adversary artificer. That adversary artificer is the
devil.<sup>[46](footnote/fn4.htm#P412_86409.md)</sup> For who would show
the way to change the *body*, but he who by wickedness transfigured
man's *spirit*? He it is, undoubtedly, who adapted ingenious devices of
this kind; that in your persons it may be apparent that you, in a
certain sense, do violence to God. Whatever is *born* is the work of
God. Whatever, then, is *plastered
on*<sup>[47](footnote/fn4.htm#P413_86760)</sup> (that.md), is the devil's
work. To superinduce on a divine work Satan's ingenuities, how criminal
is it! Our servants borrow nothing from our personal enemies: soldiers
eagerly desire nothing from the foes of their own general; for, to
demand for (your own) use anything from the adversary of Him in whose
hand<sup>[48](footnote/fn4.htm#P414_87086.md)</sup> you are, is a
transgression. Shall a Christian be assisted in anything by that evil
one? (If he do, ) I know not whether this name (of "Christian") will
continue (to belong) to him; for he will be *his* in whose lore he
eagerly desires to be instructed. But how alien from your
schoolings<sup>[49](footnote/fn4.htm#P415_87401.md)</sup> and professions
are (these things)! How unworthy the Christian name, to wear a
fictitious face, (you,) on whom simplicity in every form is enjoined!-to
lie in your appearance, (you,) to whom (lying) with the tongue is not
lawful!-to seek after what is another's, (you,) to whom is delivered
(the precept of) abstinence from what is another's!-to practise adultery
in your mien,<sup>[50](footnote/fn4.htm#P416_87797)</sup> (you,.md) who
make modesty your study!
Think,<sup>[51](footnote/fn4.htm#P417_87854)</sup> blessed (sisters.md),
how will you keep God's precepts if you shall not keep in your own
persons His lineaments?

I see some (women) turn (the colour of) their hair with saffron. They
are ashamed even of their own nation, (ashamed) that their procreation
did not assign them to Germany and to Gaul: thus, as it is, they
transfer their *hair*<sup>[52](footnote/fn4.htm#P421_88234.md)</sup>
(thither)! Ill, ay, *most* ill, do they augur for themselves with their
flame-coloured head,<sup>[53](footnote/fn4.htm#P422_88466.md)</sup> and
think that graceful which (in fact) they are polluting! Nay, moreover,
the force of the cosmetics burns ruin into the hair; and the constant
application of even any undrugged moisture, lays up a store of harm for
the head; while the sun's warmth, too, so desirable for imparting to the
hair at once growth and dryness, is hurtful. What "grace" is compatible
with "injury? "What "beauty" with "impurities? "Shall a Christian woman
heap saffron on her head, as upon an
altar?<sup>[54](footnote/fn4.htm#P423_88976.md)</sup> For, whatever is wont
to be burned to the honour of the unclean spirit, that-unless it is
applied for honest, and necessary, and salutary uses, for which God's
creature was provided-may seem to be a sacrifice. But, however, God
saith, "Which of you can make a white hair black, or out of a black a
white? "<sup>[55](footnote/fn4.htm#P424_89294.md)</sup> And so they refute
the Lord! "Behold!" say they, "instead of white or black, we make it
*yellow*,-more winning in
grace."<sup>[56](footnote/fn4.htm#P425_89436.md)</sup> And yet such as
repent of having lived to old age do *attempt* to change it even from
white to black! O temerity! The age which is the object of our wishes
and prayers blushes (for itself)! a theft is effected! youth, wherein we
have sinned,<sup>[57](footnote/fn4.htm#P426_89700.md)</sup> is sighed
after! the opportunity of sobriety is spoiled! Far from Wisdom's
daughters be folly so great! The more old age tries to conceal itself,
the more will it be detected. Here is a veritable eternity, in the
(perennial) youth of your head! Here we have an "incorruptibility" to
"put on,"<sup>[58](footnote/fn4.htm#P427_90034.md)</sup> with a view to the
new house of the Lord<sup>[59](footnote/fn4.htm#P428_90101.md)</sup> which
the divine monarchy promises! Well do you speed toward the Lord; well do
you hasten to be quit of this most iniquitous
world,<sup>[60](footnote/fn4.htm#P429_90257.md)</sup> to whom it is
unsightly to approach (your own) end!

What service, again, does all the labour spent in *arranging* the hair
render to salvation? Why is no rest allowed to your hair, which must now
be bound, now loosed, now cultivated, now thinned out? Some are anxious
to force their hair into curls, some to let it hang loose and flying;
not with good simplicity: beside which, you affix I know not what
enormities of subtle and textile perukes; now, after the manner of a
helmet of undressed hide, as it were a sheath for the head and a
covering for the crown; now, a mass (drawn) backward toward the neck.
The wonder is, that there is no (open) contending against the Lord's
prescripts! It has been pronounced that no one can add to his own
stature.<sup>[61](footnote/fn4.htm#P433_91113.md)</sup> *You*, however,
*do* add to your *weight* some kind of rolls, or shield-bosses, to be
piled upon your necks! If you feel no shame at the enormity, feel some
at the pollution; for fear you may be fitting on a holy and Christian
head the slough<sup>[62](footnote/fn4.htm#P434_91383.md)</sup> of some one
else's<sup>[63](footnote/fn4.htm#P435_91417.md)</sup> head, unclean
perchance, guilty perchance and destined to
hell.<sup>[64](footnote/fn4.htm#P436_91557.md)</sup> Nay, rather banish
quite away from your "free"<sup>[65](footnote/fn4.htm#P437_91619.md)</sup>
head all this slavery of ornamentation. In vain do you labour to seem
adorned: in vain do you call in the aid of all the most skilful
manufacturers of false hair. God bids you "be
veiled."<sup>[66](footnote/fn4.htm#P438_91839.md)</sup> I believe (He does
so) for fear the heads of some should be seen! And oh that in "that
day"<sup>[67](footnote/fn4.htm#P439_92016.md)</sup> of Christian
exultation, I, most miserable (as I am), may elevate my head, even
though below (the level of) your heels! I shall (then) see whether you
will rise with (your) ceruse and rouge and saffron, and in all that
parade of headgear:<sup>[68](footnote/fn4.htm#P440_92289.md)</sup> whether
it will be women thus tricked out whom the angels carry up to meet
Christ in the air<sup>[69](footnote/fn4.htm#P441_92458.md)</sup> If these
(decorations) are *now* good, and of God, they will *then* also present
themselves to the rising bodies, and will recognise their several
places. But nothing can rise except flesh and spirit sole and
pure.<sup>[70](footnote/fn4.htm#P442_92698.md)</sup> Whatever, therefore,
does not rise in (the form
of)<sup>[71](footnote/fn4.htm#P443_92796.md)</sup> spirit and flesh is
condemned, because it is not of God. From things which are condemned
abstain, even at the present day. At the present day let God see you
such as He will see you *then*.

Of course, now, I, a man, as being
envious<sup>[72](footnote/fn4.htm#P447_93156.md)</sup> of women, am
banishing them quite from their own (domains). Are there, in our case
too, some things which, in respect of the
sobriety<sup>[73](footnote/fn4.htm#P448_93304.md)</sup> we are to maintain
on account of the fear<sup>[74](footnote/fn4.htm#P449_93363.md)</sup> due
to God, are disallowed?<sup>[75](footnote/fn4.htm#P450_93403.md)</sup> If
it is true, (as it is,) that in men, for the sake of women (just as in
women for the sake of men), there is implanted, by a defect of nature,
the will to please; and if this sex of ours acknowledges to itself
deceptive trickeries of form peculiarly its own,-(such as) to cut the
beard too sharply; to pluck it out here and there; to shave round about
(the mouth); to arrange the hair, and disguise its hoariness by dyes; to
remove all the incipient down all over the body; to fix (each particular
hair) in its place with (some) womanly pigment; to smooth all the rest
of the body by the aid of some rough powder or other: then, further, to
take every opportunity for consulting the minor; to gaze anxiously into
it: -while yet, when (once) the knowledge of God has put an end to all
wish to please by means of voluptuous attraction, all these things are
rejected as frivolous, as hostile to modesty. For where God is, there
modesty is; there is
sobriety<sup>[76](footnote/fn4.htm#P451_94378.md)</sup> her assistant and
ally. How, then, shall we practise modesty without her instrumental
mean,<sup>[77](footnote/fn4.htm#P452_94485.md)</sup> that is, without
sobriety?<sup>[78](footnote/fn4.htm#P453_94546.md)</sup> How, moreover,
shall we bring sobriety<sup>[79](footnote/fn4.htm#P454_94601.md)</sup> to
bear on the discharge of (the functions of) modesty, unless seriousness
in appearance and in countenance, and in the general
aspect<sup>[80](footnote/fn4.htm#P455_94753.md)</sup> of the entire man,
mark our carriage?

Wherefore, with regard to clothing also, and all the remaining lumber of
your self-elaboration,<sup>[81](footnote/fn4.htm#P459_95015.md)</sup> the
like pruning off and retrenchment of too redundant splendour must be the
object of your care. For what boots it to exhibit in your *face*
temperance and unaffectedness, and a simplicity altogether worthy of the
divine discipline, but to invest all the *other* parts of the body with
the luxurious absurdities of pomps and delicacies? How intimate is the
connection which these pomps have with the business of voluptuousness,
and how they interfere with modesty, is easily discernible from the fact
that it is by the allied aid of dress that they prostitute the grace of
personal comeliness: so plain is it that if (the pomps) be wanting, they
render (that grace) bootless and thankless, as if it were disarmed and
wrecked. On the other hand, if natural beauty fails, the supporting aid
of outward embellishment supplies a grace, as it were, from its own
inherent power.<sup>[82](footnote/fn4.htm#P460_95917.md)</sup> Those times
of life, in fact, which are at last blest with quiet and withdrawn into
the harbour of modesty, the splendour and dignity of dress lure away
(from that rest and that harbour), and disquiet seriousness by
seductions of appetite, which compensate for the chili of age by the
provocative charms of apparel. First, then, blessed (sisters), (take
heed) that you admit not to your use meretricious and prostitutionary
garbs and garments: and, in the next place, if there are any of you whom
the exigencies of riches, or birth, or past dignities, compel to appear
in public so gorgeously arrayed as not to appear to have attained
wisdom, take heed to temper an evil of this kind; lest, under the
pretext of necessity, you give the rein without stint to the indulgence
of licence. For how will you be able to fulfil (the requirements of)
humility, which our (school)
profess,<sup>[83](footnote/fn4.htm#P461_96884.md)</sup> if you do not keep
within bounds<sup>[84](footnote/fn4.htm#P462_96934.md)</sup> the enjoyment
of your riches and elegancies, which tend so much to "glory? "Now it has
ever been the wont of glory to *exalt*, not to *humble*. "Why, shall we
not use what is our own? "Who prohibits your using it? Yet (it must be)
in accordance with the apostle, who warns us "to use this
world<sup>[85](footnote/fn4.htm#P463_97245.md)</sup> as if we abuse it not;
for the fashion<sup>[86](footnote/fn4.htm#P464_97323.md)</sup> of this
world<sup>[87](footnote/fn4.htm#P465_97362.md)</sup> is passing away." And
"they who buy are so to act as if they possessed
*not*."<sup>[88](footnote/fn4.htm#P466_97456.md)</sup> Why so? Because he
had laid down the premiss, saying, "The time is wound
up."<sup>[89](footnote/fn4.htm#P467_97555.md)</sup> If, then he shows
plainly that even wives themselves are so to be had as if they be not
had,<sup>[90](footnote/fn4.htm#P468_97669.md)</sup> on account of the
straits of the times, what would be his sentiments about these vain
appliances of theirs? Why, are there not many, withal, who so *do*, and
seal themselves up to eunuchhood for the sake of the kingdom of
God,<sup>[91](footnote/fn4.htm#P469_97915.md)</sup> spontaneously
relinquishing a pleasure so
honourable,<sup>[92](footnote/fn4.htm#P470_97989)</sup> and (as we know.md)
permitted? Are there not some who prohibit to themselves (the use of)
the very "creature of God,"<sup>[93](footnote/fn4.htm#P471_98117.md)</sup>
abstaining from wine and animal food, the enjoyments of which border
upon no peril or solicitude; but they sacrifice to God the humility of
their soul even in the chastened use of food? Sufficiently, therefore,
have you, too, used your riches and your delicacies; sufficiently have
you cut down the fruits of your dowries, before (receiving) the
knowledge of saving disciplines. We are they "upon whom the ends of the
ages have met, having ended their
course."<sup>[94](footnote/fn4.htm#P472_98606.md)</sup> We have been
predestined by God, before the
world<sup>[95](footnote/fn4.htm#P473_98721)</sup> was, (to arise.md) in the
extreme end of the times.<sup>[96](footnote/fn4.htm#P474_98783.md)</sup>
And so we are trained by God for the purpose of chastising, and (so to
say) emasculating, the
world.<sup>[97](footnote/fn4.htm#P475_98947.md)</sup> We are the
circumcision<sup>[98](footnote/fn4.htm#P476_98985.md)</sup> -spiritual and
carnal-of all things; for both in the spirit and in the flesh we
circumcise worldly<sup>[99](footnote/fn4.htm#P477_99109.md)</sup>
principles.

It was God, no doubt, who showed the way to dye wools with the juices of
herbs and the humours of conchs! It had escaped Him, when He was bidding
the universe to come into
being,<sup>[101](footnote/fn4.htm#P482_99468.md)</sup> to issue a command
for (the production of) purple and scarlet sheep! It was God, too, who
devised by careful thought the manufactures of those very garments
which, light and thin (in themselves), were to be heavy in price alone;
God who produced such grand implements of gold for confining or parting
the hair; God who introduced (the fashion of) finely-cut wounds for the
ears, and set so high a value upon the tormenting of His own work and
the tortures of innocent infancy, learning to suffer with its earliest
breath, in order that from those scars of the body-born for the
steel!-should hang I know not what (precious) grains, which, as we may
plainly see, the Parthians insert, in place of studs, upon their very
shoes! And yet even the gold itself, the "glory" of which carries you
away, serves a certain race (so Gentile literature. tells us) for
chains! So true is it that it is not intrinsic
worth,<sup>[102](footnote/fn4.htm#P483_100400.md)</sup> but rarity, which
constitutes the goodness (of these things): the excessive labour,
moreover, of working them with arts introduced by the means of the
sinful angels, who were the revealers withal of the material substances
themselves, joined with their rarity, excited their costliness, and
hence a lust on the part of women to possess (that) costliness. But, if
the self-same angels who disclosed both the material substances of this
kind and their charms-of gold, I mean, and
lustrous<sup>[103](footnote/fn4.htm#P484_100904.md)</sup> stones-and taught
men how to work them, and by and by instructed them, among their other
(instructions), in (the virtues of) eyelid-powder and the dyeings of
fleeces, have been condemned by God, as Enoch tells us, how shall we
please God while we joy in the *things* of those (angels) who, on these
accounts, have provoked the *anger* and the *vengeance* of God?

Now, granting that God did foresee these things; that God permitted
them; that Esaias finds fault with no garment of
purple,<sup>[104](footnote/fn4.htm#P486_101404.md)</sup> represses no
coil,<sup>[105](footnote/fn4.htm#P487_101444.md)</sup> reprobates no
crescent-shaped neck
ornaments;<sup>[106](footnote/fn4.htm#P488_101531.md)</sup> still let *us*
not, as the Gentiles do, flatter ourselves with thinking that God is
merely a Creator, not likewise a Downlooker on His own creatures. For
how far more usefully and cautiously shall we act, if we hazard the
presumption that all these things were indeed
provided<sup>[107](footnote/fn4.htm#P489_101837.md)</sup> at the beginning
and placed in the world<sup>[108](footnote/fn4.htm#P490_101901.md)</sup> by
God, in order that there should now be means of putting to the proof the
discipline of His servants, in order that the licence of using should be
the means whereby the experimental trials of *continence* should be
conducted? Do not wise heads of families purposely offer and permit some
things to their servants<sup>[109](footnote/fn4.htm#P491_102231.md)</sup>
in order to try whether and how they will use the things thus permitted
whether (they will do so) with honesty, or with moderation? But how far
more praiseworthy (the servant) who abstains entirely; who has a
wholesome fear<sup>[110](footnote/fn4.htm#P492_102476.md)</sup> even of his
lord's indulgence! Thus, therefore, the apostle too: "All things," says
he, "are lawful, but not all are
expedient."<sup>[111](footnote/fn4.htm#P493_102622.md)</sup> How much more
easily will he fear<sup>[112](footnote/fn4.htm#P494_102677.md)</sup> what
is *unlawful* who has a reverent
dread<sup>[113](footnote/fn4.htm#P495_102735.md)</sup> of what is *lawful*?

Moreover, what causes have you for appearing in public in excessive
grandeur, removed as you are from the occasions which call for such
exhibitions? For you neither make the circuit of the temples, nor demand
(to be present at) public shows, nor have any acquaintance with the holy
days of the Gentiles. Now it is for the sake of all these public
gatherings, and of much seeing and being seen, that all pomps (of dress)
are exhibited before the public eye; either for the purpose of
transacting the trade of voluptuousness, or else of inflating "glory."
*You*, however, have no cause of appearing in public, except such as is
serious. Either some brother who is sick is visited, or else the
sacrifice is offered, or else the word of God is dispensed. Whichever of
these you like to name is a business of
sobriety<sup>[114](footnote/fn4.htm#P499_103795.md)</sup> and sanctity,
requiring no extraordinary attire, with (studious) arrangement and
(wanton) negligence.<sup>[115](footnote/fn5.htm#P500_103916.md)</sup> And
if the requirements of Gentile friendships and of kindly offices call
you, why not go forth clad in your own armour; (and) all the more, in
that (you have to go) to such as are strangers to the faith? so that
between the handmaids of God and of the devil there may be a difference;
so that you may be an example to them, and they may be edified in you;
so that (as the apostle says) "God may be magnified in your
body."<sup>[116](footnote/fn5.htm#P501_104371.md)</sup> But magnified He is
in the *body* through modesty: of course, too, through attire suitable
to modesty. Well, but it is urged by some, "Let not the Name be
blasphemed in us,<sup>[117](footnote/fn5.htm#P502_104566.md)</sup> if we
make any derogatory change from our old style and dress." Let us, then,
not abolish our old vices! let us maintain the same character, if we
must maintain the same appearance (as before); and then truly the
nations will not blaspheme! A grand blasphemy is that by which it is
said, "Ever since she became a Christian, she walks in poorer garb!"
Will you fear to appear poorer, from the time that you have been made
more wealthy; and
*fouler*,<sup>[118](footnote/fn5.htm#P503_105044.md)</sup> from the time
when you have been made more clean? Is it according to the
decree<sup>[119](footnote/fn5.htm#P504_105142.md)</sup> of Gentiles, or
according to the decree of God, that it becomes Christians to walk?

Let us only wish that we may be no cause for just blasphemy! But how
much more provocative of blasphemy is it that you, who are called
modesty's priestesses, should appear in public decked and painted out
after the manner of the immodest? Else, (if you so do,) what inferiority
would the poor unhappy victims of the public lusts have (beneath you)?
whom, albeit some laws were (formerly) wont to restrain them from (the
use of) matrimonial and matronly decorations, now, at all events, the
daily increasing depravity of the
age<sup>[120](footnote/fn5.htm#P508_105877.md)</sup> has raised so nearly
to an equality with all the most honourable women, that the difficulty
is to distinguish them. And yet, even the Scriptures suggest (to us the
reflection), that meretricious attractivenesses of form are invariably
conjoined with and
appropriate<sup>[121](footnote/fn5.htm#P509_106159.md)</sup> to bodily
prostitution. That powerful
state<sup>[122](footnote/fn5.htm#P510_106218.md)</sup> which presides
over<sup>[123](footnote/fn5.htm#P511_106257.md)</sup> the seven mountains
and very many waters, has merited from the Lord the appellation of a
prostitute.<sup>[124](footnote/fn5.htm#P512_106391.md)</sup> But what kind
of garb is the instrumental mean of her comparison with that
appellation? She sits, to be sure, "in purple, and scarlet, and gold,
and precious stone." How accursed are the things without (the aid of)
which an accursed prostitute could not have been described! It was the
fact that Thamar "had painted out and adorned herself" that led Judah to
regard her as a harlot,<sup>[125](footnote/fn5.htm#P513_106798.md)</sup>
and thus, because she was hidden beneath her "veil,"-the quality of her
garb belying her as if she had been a harlot,-he judged (her to be one),
and addressed and bargained with (her as such). Whence we gather an
additional confirmation of the lesson, that provision must be made in
every way. against all immodest
associations<sup>[126](footnote/fn5.htm#P514_107161.md)</sup> and
suspicions. For why is the integrity of a chaste mind defiled by its
neighbour's suspicion? Why is a thing from which I am averse hoped for
in me? Why does not my garb pre-announce my character, to prevent my
spirit from being wounded by shamelessness through (the channel of) nay
ears? Grant that it be lawful to assume the appearance of a modest
woman:<sup>[127](footnote/fn5.htm#P515_107539.md)</sup> to assume that of
an immodest is, at all events, *not* lawful.

Perhaps some (woman) will say: "To me it is not necessary to be approved
by men; for I do not require the testimony of
men:<sup>[128](footnote/fn5.htm#P519_107969.md)</sup> God is the inspector
of the heart."<sup>[129](footnote/fn5.htm#P520_108044)</sup> (That.md) we
all know; provided, however, we remember what the same (God) has said
through the apostle: "Let your probity appear before
men."<sup>[130](footnote/fn5.htm#P521_108240.md)</sup> For what purpose,
except that malice may have no access at all to you, or that you may be
an example and testimony to the evil? Else, what is (that): "Let your
works shine? "<sup>[131](footnote/fn5.htm#P522_108473.md)</sup> Why,
moreover, does the Lord call us the light of the world; why has He
compared us to a city built upon a
mountain;<sup>[132](footnote/fn5.htm#P523_108650.md)</sup> if we do not
shine in (the midst of) darkness, and stand eminent amid them who are
sunk down? If you hide your lamp beneath a
bushel,<sup>[133](footnote/fn5.htm#P524_108804.md)</sup> you must
necessarily be left quite in darkness, and be run against by many. The
things which make us luminaries of the world are these-our good works.
What is *good*, moreover, provided it be true and full, loves not
darkness: it joys in being
seen,<sup>[134](footnote/fn5.htm#P525_109108.md)</sup> and exults over the
very pointings which are made at it. To Christian modesty it is not
enough to *be* so, but to *seem* so too. For so great ought its
plenitude to be, that it may flow out from the mind to the garb, and
burst out from the conscience to the outward appearance; so that even
from the outside it may gaze, as it were, upon its own
furniture,<sup>[135](footnote/fn5.htm#P526_109486)</sup> -(a furniture.md)
such as to be suited to retain faith as its inmate perpetually. For such
delicacies as tend by their softness and effeminacy to unman the
manliness<sup>[136](footnote/fn5.htm#P527_109671.md)</sup> of faith are to
be discarded. Otherwise, I know not whether the wrist that has been wont
to be surrounded with the palmleaf-like bracelet will endure till it
grow into the numb hardness of its own chain! I know not whether the leg
that has rejoiced in the anklet will suffer itself to be squeezed into
the gyve! I fear the neck, beset with pearl and emerald nooses, will
give no room to the broadsword! Wherefore, blessed (sisters), let us
meditate on hardships, and we shall not feel them; let us abandon
luxuries, and we shall not regret them. Let us stand ready to endure
every violence, having nothing which we may fear to leave behind. It is
these things which are the bonds which retard our hope. Let us cast away
earthly ornaments if we desire heavenly. Love not gold; in which (one
substance) are branded all the sins of the people of Israel. You ought
to *hate* what mined your fathers; what was adored by them who were
forsaking God.<sup>[137](footnote/fn5.htm#P528_110639.md)</sup> Even *then*
(we find) gold is food for the
fire.<sup>[138](footnote/fn5.htm#P529_110710.md)</sup> But Christians
always, and now more than ever, pass their times not in gold but in
iron: the stoles of martyrdom are (now) preparing: the angels who are to
carry us are (now) being awaited! Do you go forth (to meet them) already
arrayed in the cosmetics and ornaments of prophets and apostles; drawing
your whiteness from simplicity, your ruddy hue from modesty; painting
your eyes with bashfulness, and your mouth with silence; implanting in
your ears the words of God; fitting on your necks the yoke of Christ.
Submit your head to your husbands, and you will be enough adorned. Busy
your hands with spinning; keep your feet at home; and you will "please"
better than (by arraying yourselves) in gold. Clothe yourselves with the
silk of uprightness, the fine linen of holiness, the purple of modesty.
Thus painted, you will have God as your Lover!
