##  Elucidation.

This golden letter, doubtless genuine, was attended with very great
consequences, of which we shall gather more hereafter. It is worthy of
the solemn consideration of young students to whom this page may come.
Gregory was unbaptized when Origen (circa a.d. 230) thus addressed his
conscience.

On the letters here inserted, let me refer the student to Routh,
*Reliqu*., ii. pp. 312-327; also same vol., pp. 222-228; also iii.
254-256.

For the facts concerning this letter to Gregory, see Cave, i. p. 400.
