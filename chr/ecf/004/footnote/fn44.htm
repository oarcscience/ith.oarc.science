<SUP>166 </SUP>For "transgressas <I>et</I> avia fecit," I read "transgress<I>us</I> avia fecit," taking "transgressus" as a subst.</P>

<SUP>169 </SUP>Our author has somewhat mistaken Elisha's mission apparently; for as there is a significant difference in the meaning of their respective names, so there is in their works: Elijah's miracles being rather miracles of judgment, it has been remarked; Elisha's, of mercy.</P>

<SUP>170 </SUP>The reference is to a famine in Elisha's days, which - 2 Kings (in LXX. 4 Kings) viii. i. - was to last <I>seven years</I>; whereas that for which Elijah prayed, as we learn in Jas. v. 17., lasted <I>three</I> and <I>six months</I>. But it is not said that Elisha <I>prayed for</I> that famine.</P>

<P><A NAME="P4430_742244"></A>
<SUP>171 </SUP>We only read of <I>one</I> leprosy which Elisha cleansed - Naaman's. He <I>inflicted</I> leprosy on Gehazi, which was "to cleave to him and to his seed for ever."</P>

<SUP>172 </SUP>Praestata vi<I>am</I> vitae atque probata per ipsam est. I suspect we should read "vi<I>a</I>," quantity being of no importance with our author, and take "praetestata" as passive: "The way of life was testified before, and proved, through him."</P>

<P><A NAME="P4454_743478"></A>
<SUP>173 </SUP>This seems to be the meaning, and the reference will then be to Jer. xxxiv. 8-22 (in LXX. xli. 8-22); but the punctuation both in Oehler and Migne makes nonsense, and I have therefore altered it.</P>

<SUP>174 </SUP>See the apocryphal "Susanna." </P>

<SUP>175 </SUP>For "servat<I>is</I>que palam cunctis in pace quievit," which the edd. give, I suggest "servat<I>us</I>que," etc., and take "palam" for governing "cunctis."</P>
