"monumenta," i.e., the written word, according to the canon.

<span id="P5047_775190"></span> <sup>281</sup> I make no apology for the
ruggedness of the versification and the obscurity of the sense in this
book, further than to say that the state of the Latin text is such as to
render it almost impossible to find any sense at all in many places,
while the grammar and metre are not reducible to any known laws. It is
about the hardest and most uninteresting book of the five.

apparently the times during which these "elders" (i.e., the bishops, of

uses "cerno" = "*dis*cerno."
