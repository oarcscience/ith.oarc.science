<span id="P144_9382"></span> <sup>10</sup> Or, "attack."

<span id="P145_9487"></span> <sup>11</sup> Cap*ut* vindicantis. But some
read cap*ite*: "which avenges itself with its head."

<span id="P157_11627"></span> <sup>20</sup> i.e., blind. Cf. Milton, *P.

<span id="P158_13364"></span> <sup>21</sup> Alluding to the Sibylline
oracles, in which we read (l. iii.), Kai Samoj ammoj esh, kai Dhloj
adhloj and again (l. iv.), Dhloj ouk eti dhloj, adhla de panta tou Dhlou

<span id="P159_13637"></span> <sup>22</sup> See *Apolog.*, c. xi. *med.;
ad Nat.*, l. i. c. ix. *med*.; Plato, *Timaeus*, pp. 24, 25 (Oehler).

<span id="P160_14375"></span> <sup>23</sup> Oehler's apt conjecture, "et
solum sua dabat," is substituted for the unintelligible "et solus
audiebat" of the mss., which Rig. skilfully but indffectually tries to
explain.

<span id="P161_15213"></span> <sup>24</sup> The "camp" of Cambyses, said
by Herod, (iii.26) to have been swallowed up in the Libyan Syrtes (Salm.
in Oehler). It was one detachment of his army. Milton tells similar
tales of the "Serbonian bog." *P.L.*, ii. 591-594.

nominative: "the turn of compensation at some other time restores."

<span id="P165_17195"></span> <sup>28</sup> This rendering, which makes
*the earth* the subject, appears to give at least an intelligible sense
to this hopelessly corrupt passage. Oehler's pointing is disregarded;
and his rendering not strictly adhered to, as being too forced. If for
Oehler's conjectural "se demum intellegens" we might read "se *debere*
demum intellegens," or simply "se *debere* intellegens," a good sense
might be made, thus: "understanding at last" (or, simply,
"understanding") "that it was her duty to cultivate *all* (parts of her
surface)."

<span id="P166_18026"></span> <sup>29</sup> Comp. Gen. xi. 26-xii. 5

<span id="P167_18494"></span> <sup>30</sup> Saeculum.

<span id="P168_19020"></span> <sup>31</sup> Oehler understands this of
*Clodius Albinus*, and the *Augusti* mentioned above to be Severus and
his two sons Antonius and Geta. But see Kaye, pp. 36-39 (ed. 3, 1845).

<span id="P175_21467"></span> <sup>32</sup> Reflecti: perhaps a play
upon the word = to turn back, or (mentally) to reflect.

<span id="P177_22793"></span> <sup>33</sup> Orbi.

<span id="P178_22818"></span> <sup>34</sup> i.e., a place which he was
to work, as condemned criminals worked mines. Comp., *de Pu*., c. xxii.
*sub init*.; and see Gen. ii. 25 (in LXX. iii. 1), iii. 7, 21-24.

<span id="P180_23141"></span> <sup>35</sup> Alexander Polyhistor, who
dedicated his books on the affairs of the Phrygians and Egyptians to his
mother (Rig. in Oehler).

<span id="P181_23329"></span> <sup>36</sup> The Egyptian Liber, or
Bacchus. See *de Cor*., c. vii. (Rig. in Oehler).

<span id="P186_26286"></span> <sup>37</sup> Male senescentia. Rig. (as
quoted by Oehler) seems to interpret, "*which entail* a feeble old age."
Oehler himself seems to take it to mean "pursuits which are growing very
old, and toiling to no purpose."

<span id="P187_26540"></span> <sup>38</sup> Or, as some take it, *with
wax* (Oehler).

*de Idol*., c. xviii.

(Oehler).

<span id="P197_29589"></span> <sup>46</sup> Jos. Mercer, quoted by
Oehler, appears to take the meaning to be,"to his clandestine Lydian
concubine;" but that rendering does not seem necessary.

<span id="P198_30330"></span> <sup>47</sup> Viraginis; but perhaps =
virginis. See the Vulg. in Gen. ii. 23.
