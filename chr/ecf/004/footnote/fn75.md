the great pupils of the Alexandrian school, with which, however, he
seems to have had only a slight personal relation. Concerning this
Epistle to Origen, and the answer of the latter, consult Routh's very
full annotations (*ut supra*, pp. 312-328). Concerning Gregory
Thaumaturgus, the greatest of Origen's pupils, we shall know more when
we come to vol. vi. of this series. He died *circa*

<span id="P7552_1732409"></span> <sup>7</sup> Origen's most important
contribution to biblical literature was his elaborate attempt to rectify
the text of the Septuagint by collating it with the Hebrew original and
other Greek versions. On this he spent twenty-eight years, during which
he travelled through the East collecting materials. The form in which he
first issued the result of his labours was that of the *Tetrapla*, which
presented in four columns the texts of the LXX., Aquila, Symmachus, and
Theodotion. He next issued the *Hexapla*, in which the Hebrew text was
given, first in Hebrew and then in Greek letters. Of some books he gave
two additional Greek versions, whence the title *Octapla*; and there was
even a seventh Greek version added for some books. Unhappily this great
work, which extended to nearly fifty volumes, was never transcribed, and
so perished (Kitto, *Cycl*.).
