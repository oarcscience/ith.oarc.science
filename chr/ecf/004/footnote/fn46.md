<span id="P4601_750369"></span> <sup>188</sup> This is the way Oehler's
punctuation reads. Migne's reads as follows: -

Upon the chair where Peter's self had sat," etc.

<span id="P4607_750775"></span> <sup>189</sup> "Is spostolicis bene
notus." This may mean (*a*) as in our text; (*b*) by his
apostolically-minded writings - writings like an apostle's; or (*c*) by
the apostolic writings, i.e., by the mention made of him, supposing him
to be the same, in Phil. iv. 3.

<span id="P4610_751075"></span> <sup>190</sup> Legem.

<span id="P4616_751295"></span> <sup>191</sup> Legis.

<span id="P4631_751858"></span> <sup>192</sup> Germine frater.

<span id="P4633_751948"></span> <sup>193</sup> An allusion to the
well-known *Pastor* or *Shepherd* of Hermas.

<span id="P4635_752032"></span> <sup>194</sup> Our author makes the name
Anicetus. Rig. (as quoted by Oehler) observes that a comparison of the
list of bishops of Rome here given with that given by Tertullian in *de
Praescr*., c. xxxii., seems to show that this metrical piece cannot be
his.

<span id="P4648_752722"></span> <sup>195</sup> The state of the text in
some parts of this book is frightful. It has been almost hopeless to
extract any sense whatever out of the Latin in many passages - indeed,
the renderings are in these cases little better than guess-work - and
the confusion of images, ideas, and quotations is extraordinary.

<span id="P4651_753080"></span> <sup>196</sup> See the preceding book.

<span id="P4656_753319"></span> <sup>197</sup> I have changed the
unintelligible "daret" of the edd. into "docet." The reference seems to
be to Matt. xxiii. 8; Jas. iii. 1; 1 Pet. v. 2, 3.

<span id="P4659_753554"></span> <sup>198</sup> Molem belli deducere
terrae.

<span id="P4664_753782"></span> <sup>199</sup> Aemulamenta. Migne seems
to think the word refers to Marcion's "Antitheses."

<span id="P4666_753877"></span> <sup>200</sup> i.e., apparently
Marcion's.

<span id="P4668_753980"></span> <sup>201</sup> Monumenta.

<span id="P4671_754089"></span> <sup>202</sup> See the opening of the
preceding book.

<span id="P4678_754376"></span> <sup>203</sup> "Conditus;" i.e.,
probably (in violation of quantity) the past part. of "conditio" =
flavoured, seasoned.

<span id="P4682_754637"></span> <sup>204</sup> I have altered the
punctuation here.

<span id="P4686_754787"></span> <sup>205</sup> Inferni.

<span id="P4687_754811"></span> <sup>206</sup> Locator.

<span id="P4690_754917"></span> <sup>207</sup> These lines are capable,
according to their punctuation, of various renderings, which for
brevity's sake I must be content to omit.

<span id="P4692_755083"></span> <sup>208</sup> i.e., the People of
Israel. See the *de Idol*., p. 148, c. v. note 1.

<span id="P4694_755178"></span> <sup>209</sup> See Deut. vi. 3, 4,
quoted in Mark xii. 29, 30.

<span id="P4698_755387"></span> <sup>210</sup> This savours of the
Nicene Creed.
