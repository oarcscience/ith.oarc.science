<span id="P5601_842073"></span> <sup>35</sup> Otherwise, "while you
consider, while you are yet alive, poor wretches, what is threatening
after death."

<span id="P5602_842537"></span> <sup>36</sup> Some read, "with
shivering."

<span id="P5606_845218"></span> <sup>37</sup> This is otherwise read,
"Academic Pyrrhonists."

<span id="P5607_845902"></span> <sup>38</sup> Cicero, *de Natura
Deorum*, i. 22.

<span id="P5611_846730"></span> <sup>39</sup> "Plautinae prosapiae." The
expression is intended as a reproach against the humble occupations of
many of the Christian professors. Plautus is said, when in need, to have
laboured at a baker's hand-mill. Caecilius tells Octavius that he may be
the first among the millers, but he is the last among the philosophers.
Stieber proposes "Christianorum" instead of "pistorum" - "Christians"
instead of "millers."

<span id="P5615_850443"></span> <sup>40</sup> *Scil*. "Octavius."

<span id="P5619_851119"></span> <sup>41</sup> Some read, "in the light."

<span id="P5620_851244"></span> <sup>42</sup> Caecilius.

<span id="P5621_851374"></span> <sup>43</sup> Otherwise "his."

<span id="P5622_851467"></span> <sup>44</sup> Some read "cavillaverit"
instead of "vacillaverit," which would give the sense, "make captious
objections."

<span id="P5623_851799"></span> <sup>45</sup> This is otherwise given
"certainty," which helps the meaning of the passage.

<span id="P5624_852052"></span> <sup>46</sup> Otherwise, "Far from his
guileless subtlety is so crafty a trickery." But the readings are very
unsettled.

<span id="P5628_855719"></span> <sup>47</sup> Some read, "the Lord God."

<span id="P5629_856143"></span> <sup>48</sup> *Scil*. "atoms."

<span id="P5630_857312"></span> <sup>49</sup> According to some, "point
out" or "indicate."

<span id="P5631_857915"></span> <sup>50</sup> Olives ripen in the month
of December.

<span id="P5635_861873"></span> <sup>51</sup> \[In the case of Darius
Hystaspes.\]

<span id="P5636_861983"></span> <sup>52</sup> Eteocles and Polynices.

<span id="P5637_862187"></span> <sup>53</sup> Pompey and Caesar.

<span id="P5638_862264"></span> <sup>54</sup> According to some, "one
fate."

<span id="P5639_863019"></span> <sup>55</sup> These words are omitted by
some editors.

<span id="P5643_864808"></span> <sup>56</sup> Homer, *Odyss*., xviii.
136, 137.

<span id="P5644_865123"></span> <sup>57</sup> Virgil, *Aeneid*, vi. 724.

<span id="P5645_865273"></span> <sup>58</sup> Some read, "For these
things are true."

<span id="P5646_865468"></span> <sup>59</sup> Virgil, *Georgics*, iv.
221; *Aeneid*, i. 743.

<span id="P5647_866959"></span> <sup>60</sup> Otherwise, "Speusippus."

<span id="P5648_867544"></span> <sup>61</sup> The ms. here inserts,
"Aristoteles of Pontus varies, at one time attributing the supremacy to
the world, at another to the divine mind." Some think that this is an
interpolation, others transfer the words to Theophrastus below.

<span id="P5649_869111"></span> <sup>62</sup> Otherwise, "Aristo the
Chian."

<span id="P5650_870020"></span> <sup>63</sup> \[See note on Plato, chap.
xxvi.\]

<span id="P5654_871373"></span> <sup>64</sup> Some editors read, "mere
wonders," apparently on conjecture only.

<span id="P5655_871623"></span> <sup>65</sup> Otherwise, "was pleased."

<span id="P5656_872241"></span> <sup>66</sup> Four early editions read
"instantius" for "in statuis," making the meaning probably, "more
keenly," "more directly."

<span id="P5660_873334"></span> <sup>67</sup> Otherwise, according to
some, "of the historians."

<span id="P5661_874317"></span> <sup>68</sup> This treatise is mentioned
by Athenagoras, *Legat. pro Christ*., ch. xxviii. \[See vol. ii. p. 143,
this series.\] Also by Augustine, *de Civ. Dei.*, lib. viii. ch. iii.
and xxvii. In the fifth chapter Augustine calls the priest by the name
of Leo.

<span id="P5662_874829"></span> <sup>69</sup> This passage is very
doubtful both in its text and its meaning.

<span id="P5663_875766"></span> <sup>70</sup> Otherwise, "carried
about."

<span id="P5664_876133"></span> <sup>71</sup> Otherwise, "his approach
is drowned."

<span id="P5665_876843"></span> <sup>72</sup> Otherwise, "do they not
show what are the sports and the honours of your gods?"

<span id="P5666_877829"></span> <sup>73</sup> These words are very
variously read. Davis conjectures that they should be, "When Feretrius,
he does not hear," and explains the allusion as follows: that Jupiter
Feretrius could only be approached with the *spolia opima*; and Minucius
is covertly ridiculing the Romans, because, not having taken *spolia
opima* for so long a time, they could not approach Feretrius.

<span id="P5667_878393"></span> <sup>74</sup> Otherwise, "pointed out,"
or "designated."

<span id="P5668_878650"></span> <sup>75</sup> Otherwise corrupted into
Aetna.

<span id="P5672_879392"></span> <sup>76</sup> Some read, "and it is
marvellous how these have prejudiced," etc.

<span id="P5673_879473"></span> <sup>77</sup> Some read, "the truth
itself."

<span id="P5674_879681"></span> <sup>78</sup> Plat., *de Rep*., lib.
iii.

<span id="P5675_880531"></span> <sup>79</sup> Otherwise, "Then Vulcan
fabricates," etc.

<span id="P5676_881096"></span> <sup>80</sup> Otherwise, "judgments."

<span id="P5680_884531"></span> <sup>81</sup> "Be created" is a more
probable reading.

<span id="P5681_885361"></span> <sup>82</sup> Otherwise, "that he had
rashly been so deceived by the artificer in the material, as to make a
god."

<span id="P5682_885673"></span> <sup>83</sup> \[Footbaths. See vol. ii.,
*Theophilus*, p. 92, and *Athenagoras*, p. 143.\]

<span id="P5689_889988"></span> <sup>84</sup> Parricidium.

<span id="P5690_890246"></span> <sup>85</sup> Virg., *Aeneid*, viii.
635.

<span id="P5691_892296"></span> <sup>86</sup> Some read "probra" for
"morbos," *scil*. "reproaches."

<span id="P5695_894817"></span> <sup>87</sup> Reipublicae; but it is
shrewdly conjectured that the passage was written, "cum majore R. P.
parte" - "with the greater part of the Roman people," and the mistake
made by the transcriber of the ms.

<span id="P5696_897250"></span> <sup>88</sup> Otherwise Hostanes.

<span id="P5697_897630"></span> <sup>89</sup> \[Octavius and Minucius
had but one mind (see cap. i. *supra*), and both were philosophers of
the Attic Academy reflecting Cicero. See my remarks on Athenagoras, vol.
ii. p. 126, this series.\]

<span id="P5698_898252"></span> <sup>90</sup> According to some editors,
"warns us that the desire of love is received."
