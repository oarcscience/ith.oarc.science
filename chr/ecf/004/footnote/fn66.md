<span id="P6655_1347164"></span> <sup>133</sup> These words are found in
Jerome's *Epistle to Avitus*, and, literally translated, are as follows:
"Whence infinite caution is to be employed, lest perchance, after souls
have obtained salvation and come to the blessed life, they should cease
to be souls. For as our Lord and Saviour came to seek and to save what
was lost, that it might cease to be lost; so the soul which was lost,
and for whose salvation the Lord came, shall, when it has been saved,
cease for a soul. This point in like manner must be examined, whether,
as that which has been lost was at one time not lost, and a time will
come when it will be no longer lost; so also at some time a soul may not
have been a soul, and a time may be when it will by no means continue to
be a soul." A portion of the above is also found, in the original Greek,
in the Emporer Justinian's Letter to Menas, Patriarch of Constantinople.

(Nouj) somehow, then, has become a soul, and the soul, being restored,
becomes an understanding. The understanding falling away, was made a
soul, and the soul, again, when furnished with virtues, will become an
understanding. For if we examine the case of Esau, we may find that he
was condemned because of his ancient sins in a worse course of life. And
respecting the heavenly bodies we must inquire, that not at the time
when the world was created did the soul of the sun, or whatever else it
ought to be called, begin to exist, but before that it entered that
shining and burning body. We may hold similar opinions regarding the
moon and stars, that, for the foregoing reasons, they were compelled,
unwillingly, to subject themselves to vanity on account of the rewards
of the future; and to do, not their own will, but the will of their
Creator, by whom they were arranged among their different offices." -
*Jerome's Epistle to Avitus*. From these, as well as other passages, it
may be seen how widely Rufinus departed in his translation from the
original.

passage is found in Justinian's Epistle to Menas, Patriarch of
Constantinople, *apud finem*. "In that beginning which is cognisable by
the understanding, God, by His own will, caused to exist as great a
number of intelligent beings as was sufficient; for we must say that the
power of God is finite, and not, under pretence of praising Him, take
away His limitation. For if the divine power be infinite, it must of
necessity be unable to understand even itself, since that which is
naturally illimitable is incapable of being comprehended. He made things
therefore so great as to be able to apprehend and keep them under His
power, and control them by His providence; so also He prepared matter of
such a size (tosauthn ulhn) as He had the power to ornament."
