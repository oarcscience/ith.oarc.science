<SUP>306 </SUP>i.e., through flesh. </P>

<P><A NAME="P5217_784038"></A>
<SUP>307 </SUP>i.e., in His own person.</P>

<P><A NAME="P5224_784321"></A>
<SUP>308 </SUP>I hope I have succeeded in giving some intelligible sense; but the passage as it stands in the Latin is nearly hopeless.</P>

<P><A NAME="P5229_784565"></A>
<SUP>309 </SUP>I read "lege<I>m</I>" for "lege<I>s</I>."</P>

<P><A NAME="P5230_784625"></A>
<SUP>310 </SUP>I read "<I>v</I>alle" for "<I>c</I>alle."</P>

<P><A NAME="P5236_784837"></A>
<SUP>311 </SUP>Alios.</P>

<P><A NAME="P5237_784873"></A>
<SUP>312 </SUP>Altera.</P>

<P><A NAME="P5247_785292"></A>
<SUP>313 </SUP>i.e., "the gifts of baptism."</P>

<P><A NAME="P5257_785757"></A>
<SUP>314 </SUP>This seems to give sense to a very obscure passage, in which I have been guided more by Migne's pointing than by Oehler's.</P>

<P><A NAME="P5259_785892"></A>
<SUP>315 </SUP>I read here "qu<I>i</I>d" for "qu<I>o</I>d."</P>

<P><A NAME="P5262_786031"></A>
<SUP>316 </SUP>i.e., to make men live by recognising that. Comp. the Psalmist's prayer: "Give me <I>understanding</I> and I shall live" (Ps. cxix. 144; in LXX., Ps. cxviii. 144).</P>

<P><A NAME="P5265_786284"></A>
<SUP>317 </SUP>The "f<I>u</I>rentes" of Pam. and Rig. is preferred to Oehler's "f<I>e</I>rentes."</P>

<P><A NAME="P5270_786490"></A>
<SUP>318 </SUP>"Complexis," lit. "embracing."</P>

<P><A NAME="P5272_786590"></A>
<SUP>319 </SUP>i.e., both Jews and Gentile heretics, the "senseless frantic men" just referred to probably: or possibly the "ambo" may mean "<I>both sects</I>," viz., the Marcionites and Manichees, against whom the writer whom Oehler supposes to be the probable author of these "Five Books," Victorinus, a rhetorician of Marseilles, directed his efforts. But it may again be the acc. neut. pl., and mean "let them" - i.e., the "senseless frantic men" - "learn to believe <I>as to both facts</I>," i.e., the incarnation and the resurrection; (see vers. 179, 180;) "the testimony at least of human reason."</P>

<P><A NAME="P5282_787530"></A>
<SUP>320 </SUP>I would suggest here, for</P>

    <UL><UL><P>" ... quia summa voluntas</P>

    <P>In cujus manu regnantis cor <I>legibus esset</I>,"something like this,</P>

    <P>" ... quia summa voluntas,</P>

</UL></UL><P>In cujus manu regnantis cor <I>regis, egisset</I>,"which would only add one more to our author's false quantities. "Regum egisset" would avoid even that, while it would give some sense. Comp. Prov. xxi. 1.</P>

<P><A NAME="P5287_788009"></A>
<SUP>321 </SUP>Maria cum conjuge feta. What follows seems to decide the meaning of "feta," as a child could hardly be included in a census before birth.</P>

<P><A NAME="P5296_788468"></A>
<SUP>322 </SUP>Again I have had to attempt to amend the text of the Latin in order to extract any sense, and am far from sure that I have extracted the right one. </P>

<P><A NAME="P5298_788642"></A>
<SUP>323 </SUP>"Fatentur," unless our author use it passively = "are confessed."</P>
