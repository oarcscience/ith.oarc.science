<span id="P2302_631707"></span> <sup>7</sup> "Divinos;" i.e., apparently
"superhuman," as everything *heavenly* is.

<span id="P2308_631981"></span> <sup>8</sup> Of hospitality - bread and
salt, etc.

<span id="P2309_632036"></span> <sup>9</sup> "Mens*a*;" but perhaps
"mensae" may be suggested - "the sacred pledges *of the board*."

<span id="P2310_632134"></span> <sup>10</sup> "Dispungit," which is the
only verb in the sentence, and refers both to *pia pignora* and to
*amicos*. I use "quit" in the sense in which we speak of "quitting a
debtor," i.e., giving him his full due; but the two lines are very hard,
and present (as in the case of those before quoted) a jumble of words
without grammar; "pia pignora mensa Officiisque probis studio dispungit
amicos;" which may be somewhat more literally rendered than in our text,
thus: "he zealously discharges" (i.e., fulfils) "his sacred pledges"
(i.e., the promised hospitality which he had offered them) "with (a
generous) board, and discharges" (i.e., fulfils his obligations to) "his
friends with honourable courtesies."

<span id="P2313_632910"></span> <sup>11</sup> Altera = alterna. But the
statement differs from Gen. xix. 4.

<span id="P2318_633166"></span> <sup>12</sup> "Istam juventam," i.e.,
the two "juvenes" (ver. 31) within.

<span id="P2331_633728"></span> <sup>13</sup> "Fas" = osion, *morally*
right; distinct from "jus" or "licitum."

<span id="P2378_635720"></span> <sup>14</sup> i.e., Lot's race or
family, which had come from "Ur of the Chaldees." See Gen. xi. 26, 27,
28.

<span id="P2383_635984"></span> <sup>15</sup> I use "preventing" in its
now unusual sense of "anticipating the arrival of."
