follows: "The world being so very varied, and containing so many
different rational beings, what else ought we to say was the cause of
its existence than the diversity of the falling away of those who
decline from unity (thj enadoj) in different ways?" - Ruaeus. Lommatzsch

sometimes the soul selects the life that is in water" (enudron).

<span id="P6497_1262889"></span> <sup>15</sup> This passage is found in
Jerome's *Epistle to Avitus*; and, literally translated, his rendering
is as follows: "If these (views) are not contrary to the faith, we shall
perhaps at some future time live without bodies. But if he who is
perfectly subject to Christ is understood to be without a body, and all
are to be subjected to Christ, we also shall be without bodies when we
have been completely subjected to Him. If all have been subjected to
God, all will lay aside their bodies, and the whole nature of bodily
things will be dissolved into nothing; but if, in the second place,
necessity shall demand, it will again come into existence on account of
the fall of rational creatures. For God has abandoned souls to struggle
and wrestling, that they may understand that they have obtained a full
and perfect victory, not by their own bravery, but by the grace of God.
And therefore I think that for a variety of causes are different worlds
created, and the errors of those refuted who contend that worlds
resemble each other." A fragment of the Greek original of the above is
found in the Epistle of Justinian to the patriarch of Constantinople.
"If the things subject to Christ shall at the end be subjected also to
God, all will lay aside their bodies; and then, I think, there will be a
dissolution (analusij) of the nature of bodies into non-existence (eij
to mh on), to come a second time into existence, if rational (beings)
should again gradually come down (upokatabh)."
