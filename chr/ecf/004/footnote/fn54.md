<span id="P5410_794138"></span> <sup>347</sup> For "*di*misit in
*um*bris" I read here "*de*misit in *im*bris." If we retain the former
reading, it will then mean, "dispersed during the shades of night,"
during which it was that the manna seems always to have fallen.

<span id="P5413_794432"></span> <sup>348</sup> "Sitient*is*" in Oehler
must be a misprint for "sitient*es*."

<span id="P5422_794876"></span> <sup>349</sup> There ought to be a "se"
in the Latin if this be the meaning.

<span id="P5428_795108"></span> <sup>350</sup> For "Mundator carnis
*serae*" = "the Cleanser of *late* flesh" (which would seem, if it mean
anything, to mean that the flesh had to wait long for its cleansing), I
have read "carnis *nostrae*."

<span id="P5432_795439"></span> <sup>351</sup> Lignum.

<span id="P5438_795647"></span> <sup>352</sup> I have followed the
disjointed style of the Latin as closely as I could here.

<span id="P5450_796197"></span> <sup>353</sup> Here we seem to see the
idea of the "limbus patrum."

<span id="P5454_796420"></span> <sup>354</sup> "Subiens" = "going
beneath," i.e., apparently coming beneath *the walls of heaven.*

<span id="P5461_796733"></span> <sup>355</sup> i.e., a figure of the
future harvest.

<span id="P5467_796946"></span> <sup>356</sup> I have hazarded the
conjecture "m*inu*tus" here for the edd.'s "m*uni*tus." It add's one
more, it is true, to our author's false quantities, but that is a minor
difficulty, while it improves (to my mind) the sense vastly.
