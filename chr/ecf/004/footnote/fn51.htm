<SUP>290 </SUP>Cf. John i. 11, and see the Greek.</P>

<P><A NAME="P5115_778585"></A>
<SUP>291 </SUP>Whether this be the sense I know not. The passage is a mass of confusion.</P>

<P><A NAME="P5120_778832"></A>
<SUP>292 </SUP>i.e., according to Marcion's view.</P>

<P><A NAME="P5123_778972"></A>
<SUP>293 </SUP>i.e., as spirits, like himself. </P>

<P><A NAME="P5128_779141"></A>
<SUP>294 </SUP>Mundum.</P>

<P><A NAME="P5133_779338"></A>
<SUP>295 </SUP>i.e., Marcionite.</P>

<P><A NAME="P5135_779399"></A>
<SUP>296 </SUP>See book ii. 3.</P>

<P><A NAME="P5137_779458"></A>
<SUP>297 </SUP>i.e., apparently on the day of Christ's resurrection.</P>

<P><A NAME="P5142_779689"></A>
<SUP>298 </SUP>Rep<I>l</I>esset, i.e., replevisset. If this be the right reading, the meaning would seem to be, "would have taken away all further desire for" them, as satiety or <I>repletion</I> takes away all appetite for food. One is almost inclined to hazard the suggestion "rep<I>r</I>esset," i.e., repressisset, "he would have <I>repressed</I>," but that such a contraction would be irregular. Yet, with an author who takes such liberties as the present one, perhaps that might not be a decisive objection.</P>

<P><A NAME="P5149_780415"></A>
<SUP>299 </SUP>"Junct<I>u</I>s," for the edd.'s "junct<I>is</I>," which, if retained, will mean "in the case of beings still joined with (or to) blood."</P>

<P><A NAME="P5156_780795"></A>
<SUP>300 </SUP>"Doc<I>e</I>tur," for the edd.'s "doc<I>en</I>tur." The sense seems to be, if there be any, exceedingly obscure; but for the idea of a half-salvation - the salvation of the "inner man" without the outer - being no salvation at all, and unworthy of "the Good Shepherd" and His work, we may compare the very difficult passage in the <I>de Pudic.</I>, c. xiii. <I>ad fin</I>.</P>

<P><A NAME="P5168_781605"></A>
<SUP>301 </SUP>This sense, which I deduce from a transposition of one line and the supplying of the words "<I>he did exhort</I>," which are not expressed, but seem necessary, in the original, agrees well with 1 Cor. vii., which is plainly the passage referred to.</P>

<P><A NAME="P5181_782396"></A>
<SUP>302 </SUP>"Causa;" or perhaps "<I>means</I>." It is, of course, the French "chose."</P>

<P><A NAME="P5186_782638"></A>
<SUP>303 </SUP>i.e., you and your like, through whom sin, and in consequence death, is disseminated.</P>

<P><A NAME="P5194_783043"></A>
<SUP>304 </SUP>Here, again, for the sake of the sense, I have transposed a line.</P>

<P><A NAME="P5198_783241"></A>
<SUP>305 </SUP>i.e., "the other," the "inner man," or spirit.</P>
