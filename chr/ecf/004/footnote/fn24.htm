<SUP>19 </SUP>The story of Pha&euml;thon and his fate is told in Ov., <I>Met</I>., ii. 1-399, which may be compared with the present piece. His two sisters were transformed into white poplars, according to some; alders, according to others. See Virg., <I>Aen</I>., x. 190 sqq., <I>Ec</I>., vi. 62 sqq. His hal-brother (Cycnus or Cygnus) was turned into a swan: and the scene of these transformations is laid by Ovid on the banks of the Eridanus (the Po). But the fable is variously told; and it has been suggested that the groundwork of it is to be found rather in the still-standing of the sun recorded in Joshua.</P>

<SUP>21 </SUP>I have hazarded the bold conjecture - which I see others (Pamelius at all events) had hazarded before me - that "feritas" is used by our author as - "fertilitas." The word, of course, is very incorrectly formed etymologically; but etymology is not our author's <I>forte</I> apparently. It will also be seen that there is seemingly a gap at this point, or else some enormous mistake, in the mss. An attempt has been made (see Migne) to correct it, but not a very satisfactory one. For the common reading, which gives two lines,</P>

    <UL><UL><P>"Occidit illa prior feritas, quam prospiciens Loth</P>

    <P>Nullus arat frustra piceas fuligine glebas,"which are evidently entirely unconnected with one another, it is proposed to read,</P>

    <P>"Occidit illa prior feritas, quam prospiciens Loth,</P>

    <P><I>Deseruisse pii fertur commercia fratris.</I></P>

</UL></UL><P>Nullas arat," etc.This use of "fratris" in a wide sense may be justified from Gen. xiii. 8 (to which passage, with its immediate context, there seems to be a reference, whether we adopt the proposed correction or no), and similar passages in Holy Writ. But the transition is still abrupt to the "nullus arat," etc.; and I prefer to leave the passage as it is, without attempting to supply the hiatus.</P>

<SUP>22 </SUP>This use of "easely" as a dissyllable is justifiable from Spenser.</P>

<P><A NAME="P2465_641419"></A>
<SUP>23 </SUP>This seems to be the sense, but the Latin is somewhat strange: "morsest maris illa quieti," i.e., illa (quies) maris quieti mors est. The opening lines of "Jonah" (above) should be compared with this passage and its context. </P>
