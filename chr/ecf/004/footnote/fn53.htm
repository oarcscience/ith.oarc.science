<P><A NAME="P5304_788955"></A>
<SUP>325 </SUP>Because Christ plainly, as they understood Him, "made Himself the Son of God;" and hence, if they confessed that He had said the truth, and yet that they hanged Him on a tree, they would be pronouncing their own condemnation.</P>

<P><A NAME="P5306_789240"></A>
<SUP>326 </SUP>"Vi<I>n</I>ctam" for "victam" I read here.</P>

<SUP>327 </SUP>i.e., you and the Jews. See above on 185.</P>

<SUP>328 </SUP>Quod qui praesumpsit mergentes spargitis ambo. What the meaning is I know not, unless it be this: if any one hints to you that you are in an error which is sinking you into perdition, you both join in trying to sink <I>him</I> (if "mergentes" be active; or "while you are sinking," if neuter), and in sprinkling him with your doctrine (or besprinkling him with abuse).</P>

<SUP>330 </SUP>"Sum carnis membra requirit," i.e., seeking to regain <I>for God</I> all the limbs of the flesh as His instruments. Comp. Rom. vi. 13, 19.</P>

<SUP>333 </SUP>Fel miscetur <I>aceto</I>. The reading may have arisen - and it is not confined to our author - from confounding <FONT FACE='SPIonic'>ocoj</FONT> with <FONT FACE='SPIonic'>oinoj</FONT>. Comp. Matt. xxvii. 33 with Mark xv. 23.</P>

<P><A NAME="P5337_790991"></A>
<SUP>334 </SUP>This is an error, if the "coat" be meant.</P>

<P><A NAME="P5339_791050"></A>
<SUP>335 </SUP>Perhaps for "in ill<I>a</I>" we should read "in all<I>am</I>" - "on it," for "in it."</P>

<SUP>336 </SUP>The Jews.</P>

<P><A NAME="P5365_792155"></A>
<SUP>337 </SUP>For "ante diem qu<I>am cum</I> pateretur" I have read "qu<I>a tum</I>."</P>

<P><A NAME="P5367_792286"></A>
<SUP>338 </SUP>Or, "deed" - "factum."</P>

<P><A NAME="P5371_792416"></A>
<SUP>339 </SUP>Or, "<I>is being</I> poured" - "funditur."</P>

<P><A NAME="P5383_792857"></A>
<SUP>341 </SUP>I read with Migne, "<I>Patris</I> sub imagine virtus," in preference to the conjecture which Oehler follows, "<I>Christi </I>sub imagine virtus." The reference seems clearly to be to Heb. i. 3.</P>

<P><A NAME="P5385_793106"></A>
<SUP>342 </SUP>Aevo. Perhaps here = "eternity."</P>
