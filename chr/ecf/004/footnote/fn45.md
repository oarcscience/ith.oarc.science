consumpta volumina vatum. *Multa* must, apparently, be an error for some
word signifying "mould" or the like; unless, with the disregard of
construction and quantity observable in this author, it be an *acc. pl*.
to agree with *volumina*, so that we must take *"omnia multa volumina"*
together, which would alter the whole construction of the context.

should be noted and compared with its usage in the LXX., especially in
the Psalms. See Luke ii. 30.

<span id="P4556_748177"></span> <sup>184</sup> The common reading is,
"Atque suae famulae porta*vit* spreta dolorem." for which Oehler reads
"porta*rit*;" but I incline rather to suggest that "porta*vit*" be
retained, but that the "a*t*que" be changed into "a*e*que," thus:
"A*e*que suae famulae porta*vit* spreta dolorem;" i.e., Since, like
Sarah, the once barren Christian church-mother hath had children,
*equally*, like Sarah, hath she had to bear scorn and spleen at her
handmaid's - the Jewish church-mother's - hands.
