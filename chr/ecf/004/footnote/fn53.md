<span id="P5302_788847"></span> <sup>324</sup> "Possunt," i.e., probably
"have the hardihood."

<span id="P5304_788955"></span> <sup>325</sup> Because Christ plainly,
as they understood Him, "made Himself the Son of God;" and hence, if
they confessed that He had said the truth, and yet that they hanged Him
on a tree, they would be pronouncing their own condemnation.

<span id="P5306_789240"></span> <sup>326</sup> "Vi*n*ctam" for "victam"
I read here.

<span id="P5312_789485"></span> <sup>327</sup> i.e., you and the Jews.
See above on 185.

<span id="P5320_789804"></span> <sup>328</sup> Quod qui praesumpsit
mergentes spargitis ambo. What the meaning is I know not, unless it be
this: if any one hints to you that you are in an error which is sinking
you into perdition, you both join in trying to sink *him* (if
"mergentes" be active; or "while you are sinking," if neuter), and in
sprinkling him with your doctrine (or besprinkling him with abuse).

<span id="P5323_790251"></span> <sup>329</sup> Mundus.

<span id="P5327_790368"></span> <sup>330</sup> "Sum carnis membra
requirit," i.e., seeking to regain *for God* all the limbs of the flesh
as His instruments. Comp. Rom. vi. 13, 19.

<span id="P5332_790671"></span> <sup>331</sup> Ligno.

<span id="P5334_790727"></span> <sup>332</sup> "Scriblita," a curious
word.

<span id="P5335_790782"></span> <sup>333</sup> Fel miscetur *aceto*. The
reading may have arisen - and it is not confined to our author - from
confounding ocoj with oinoj. Comp. Matt. xxvii. 33 with Mark xv. 23.

<span id="P5337_790991"></span> <sup>334</sup> This is an error, if the
"coat" be meant.

<span id="P5339_791050"></span> <sup>335</sup> Perhaps for "in ill*a*"
we should read "in all*am*" - "on it," for "in it."

<span id="P5351_791649"></span> <sup>336</sup> The Jews.

<span id="P5365_792155"></span> <sup>337</sup> For "ante diem qu*am cum*
pateretur" I have read "qu*a tum*."

<span id="P5367_792286"></span> <sup>338</sup> Or, "deed" - "factum."

<span id="P5371_792416"></span> <sup>339</sup> Or, "*is being* poured" -
"funditur."

<span id="P5377_792698"></span> <sup>340</sup> Mundi.

<span id="P5383_792857"></span> <sup>341</sup> I read with Migne,
"*Patris* sub imagine virtus," in preference to the conjecture which
Oehler follows, "*Christi* sub imagine virtus." The reference seems
clearly to be to Heb. i. 3.

<span id="P5385_793106"></span> <sup>342</sup> Aevo. Perhaps here =
"eternity."

<span id="P5388_793209"></span> <sup>343</sup> i.e., "The All-Holder."

<span id="P5390_793259"></span> <sup>344</sup> Capit.

xxxii. 30; Manoah's in Judg. xiii. 22; etc.
