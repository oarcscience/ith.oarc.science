<span id="P4800_761381"></span> <sup>230</sup> Comp. the preceding book,
355.

<span id="P4813_761834"></span> <sup>231</sup> The passage which follows
is almost unintelligible. The sense which I have offered in my text is
so offered with great diffidence, as I am far from certain of having hit
the meaning; indeed, the state of the text is such, that *any* meaning
must be a matter of some uncertainty.

<span id="P4815_762202"></span> <sup>232</sup> i.e., perhaps the Jewish
and Christian peoples. Comp. *adv. Jud*., c. 1.

<span id="P4817_762291"></span> <sup>233</sup> i.e., "barren" of faith
and good works. The "goats" being but "kids" (see Lev. xvi. 8), would,
of course, be barren. "Exiled" seems to mean "excommunicated." But the
comparison of the sacrificed goat to a penitent, and of the scapegoat to
an impenitent, excommunicate, is extravagant. Yet I see no other sense.

<span id="P4821_762747"></span> <sup>234</sup> See Matt. xxv. 31-33.

<span id="P4829_763076"></span> <sup>235</sup> i.e., Lazarus was not
allowed to help him. In that sense he may be said to have been "cast
away;" but it is Abraham, not Lazarus, who pronounces his doom. See Luke
xvi. 19-31.

<span id="P4833_763384"></span> <sup>236</sup> i.e., in that the blood
of the one was brought within the veil; the other was not.

<span id="P4835_763525"></span> <sup>237</sup> Aedem.

<span id="P4841_763746"></span> <sup>238</sup> The meaning seems to be,
that *the ark*, when it had to be removed from place to place, has (as
we learn from Num. iv. 5) to be covered with "the second veil" (as it is
called in Heb. ix. 3), which was "of blue," etc. But that this veil was
made "of lambs' skins" does not appear; on the contrary, it was made of
"linen." The *outer* veil, indeed (not the out*most*, which was of
"badgers' skins," according to the Eng. ver.; but of "uakinqina dermata"
- of what material is not said - according to the LXX.), *was* made "of
rams' skins;" but then they were "dyed *red*" (hruqrodanwmena, LXX.),
not "*blue*." So there is some confusion in our author.

<span id="P4843_764433"></span> <sup>239</sup> The ark was overlaid with
gold *without* as well as within. (See Ex. xxv. 10, 11, xxxvii. 1, 2;
and this is referred to in Heb. ix. 3, 4 - kibwton ... perikekalummenhn
- where our Eng. ver. rendering is defective, and in the context as
well.) This, however, may be said to be implied in the following words:
"and *all between*," i.e., between the layers above and beneath, "of
wood."

<span id="P4847_764974"></span> <sup>240</sup> Migne supposes some error
in these words. Certainly the sense is dark enough; but see lower down.

<span id="P4849_765130"></span> <sup>241</sup> It yielded "almonds,"
according to the Eng. ver. (Num. xvii. 8). But see the LXX.

<span id="P4852_765322"></span> <sup>242</sup> Sagmina. But the word is
a very strange one to use indeed. See the Latin Lexicons, *s.v.*

<span id="P4854_765437"></span> <sup>243</sup> It might be questionable
whether "jussa" refers to "cherubim" or to "sagmina."

<span id="P4860_765735"></span> <sup>244</sup> i.e., twice three + the
central one = 7.

<span id="P4863_765846"></span> <sup>245</sup> Our author persists in
calling the tabernacle temple.

<span id="P4868_766035"></span> <sup>246</sup> i.e., the Law's.

<span id="P4871_766138"></span> <sup>247</sup> "*T*egebat," i.e., with
the "fiery-cloudy pillar," unless it be an error for "*r*egebat," which
still might apply to the pillar.

<span id="P4876_766416"></span> <sup>248</sup> Terrae.

<span id="P4880_766561"></span> <sup>249</sup> "Operae," i.e.,
sacrifices. The Latin is a hopeless jumble of words without grammatical
sequence, and any rendering is mere guesswork.

<span id="P4882_766733"></span> <sup>250</sup> Heb. ix. 7.

<span id="P4884_766805"></span> <sup>251</sup> i.e., of animals which,
as irrational, were "without the Law."

<span id="P4887_766959"></span> <sup>252</sup> Terram.

<span id="P4894_767232"></span> <sup>253</sup> Rev. vi. 9, 10.

<span id="P4895_767262"></span> <sup>254</sup> i.e., beneath the altar.
See the 11th verse *ib*.

<span id="P4899_767458"></span> <sup>255</sup> Or possibly, "deeper than
the glooms:" "altior a tenebris."
