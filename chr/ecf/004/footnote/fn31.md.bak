<span id="P3106_672520"></span> <sup>43</sup> Or, "there." The question
is, whether a different tree is meant, or the rose just spoken of.

<span id="P3113_672909"></span> <sup>44</sup> This seems to be
*marshmallows.*

<span id="P3117_673049"></span> <sup>45</sup> Here again it is plain
that the writer is drawing his description from what we read of the
garden of Eden.

<span id="P3131_673711"></span> <sup>46</sup> "Salus," health (probably)
in its widest sense, both bodily and mental; or perhaps "safety,"
"salvation."

<span id="P3139_674092"></span> <sup>47</sup> Reliquam vitam, i.e.,
apparently his life in all other relations; unless it mean his life
*after his parents' death*, which seems less likely.

<span id="P3160_675066"></span> <sup>48</sup> i.e., "appeals to." So
Burke: "I *attest* the former, I *attest* the coming generations." This
"attesting of its acts" seems to refer to Matt. xxv. 44. It appeals to
them in hope of mitigating its doom.

<span id="P3164_675416"></span> <sup>49</sup> This seems to be the
sense. The Latin stands thus: "Flammas pro meritis, stagnantia tela
tremiscunt."

<span id="P3187_676457"></span> <sup>50</sup> Or, "banished."

<span id="P3196_676796"></span> <sup>51</sup> I adopt the correction
(suggested in Migne) of just*is* for just*as*.

<span id="P3198_676898"></span> <sup>52</sup> This is an extraordinary
use for the Latin dative; and even if the meaning be "*for* (i.e., to
suffer) penalty eternal," it is scarcely less so.
