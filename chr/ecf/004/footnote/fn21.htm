<SUP>9 </SUP>M<I>a</I>ndare (Oehler). If this be the true reading, the rendering in the text seems to represent the meaning; for "mandare" with <I>an accusative</I>, in the sense of "to <I>bid</I> the tardy coils tighten the girth's noose," seems almost too gross a solecism for even so lax a Latinist as our present writer. Migne, however, reads m<I>u</I>ndare-<I>to "clear" the tardy coils,</I> i.e., probably from the wash and weed with which the gale was cloying them.</P>

<SUP>10 </SUP>Tunc Domini vates ingesta Spiritus infit. Of course it is a gross offence against quantity to make a genitive in "us" short, as the rendering in the text does. But a writer who makes the first syllable in "clamor" and the last syllable of gerunds in <I>do</I> short, would scarcely be likely to hesitate about taking similar liberties with a genitive of the so-called fourth declension. It is possible, it is true, to take "vates" and "Spiritus" as in apposition, and render, "Then the seer-Spirit of the Lord begins to utter words inspired," or "Then the seer-Spirit begins to utter the promptings of the Lord." But these renderings seem to accord less well with the ensuing words.</P>
