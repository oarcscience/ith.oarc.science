<span id="P4101_724209"></span> <sup>107</sup> "Tantum" = "tantum
quantum primo fuerat," i.e., with a body as well as a spirit.

<span id="P4113_724769"></span> <sup>108</sup> Pignus: "the *promise* of
the Father" (Acts i. 4); "the *earnest* of the Spirit" (2 Cor. i. 22; v.
5.). See, too, Eph. i. 13, 14; Rom. viii. 23.

<span id="P4123_725334"></span> <sup>109</sup> The reference is to John
iii. 6, but it is not quite correctly given.

<span id="P4125_725483"></span> <sup>110</sup> See note on 245, above.

<span id="P4128_725616"></span> <sup>111</sup> See 2 Cor. v. 1. sqq.

<span id="P4133_725798"></span> <sup>112</sup> I read "iner*um*" - a
very rare form - here for "inerm*em*." But there seems a confusion in
the text, which here, as elsewhere, is probably corrupt.

<span id="P4138_726113"></span> <sup>113</sup> "Cer*ae*," which seems
senseless here, I have changed to "cer*eris*."

<span id="P4141_726288"></span> <sup>114</sup> There seems to be a
reference to 2 Pet. i. 17.

<span id="P4143_726380"></span> <sup>115</sup> Here again I have altered
the punctuation by a very simple change.

<span id="P4147_726585"></span> <sup>116</sup> See 1 Cor. xv. 54; Isa.
xxv. 8 (where the LXX. have a strange reading).

<span id="P4153_726848"></span> <sup>117</sup> Isa. liv. 1; Gal. iv. 27.

<span id="P4155_726924"></span> <sup>118</sup> Gal. iv. 19-31.

<span id="P4159_727077"></span> <sup>119</sup> The Jewish people leaving
Christ, "the fountain of living waters" (Jer. ii. 13; John vii. 37-39),
is compared to Hagar leaving the well, which was, we may well believe,
close to Abraham's tent.

<span id="P4161_727334"></span> <sup>120</sup> Et tepidis errans ardenti
sidere potat. See Gen. xxi. 12-20.

<span id="P4165_727521"></span> <sup>121</sup> See Matt. xix. 27; Mark
x. 28; Luke xviii. 28.

<span id="P4174_727884"></span> <sup>122</sup> See Matt. xxiii. 35.

<span id="P4182_728185"></span> <sup>123</sup> i.e., apparently the
"giants;" see Gen. vi. 4; but there is no mention of them in Enoch's
time (Migne).

<span id="P4185_728387"></span> <sup>124</sup> i.e., over the general
sinfulness.

<span id="P4188_728479"></span> <sup>125</sup> I suggest "translat*us*"
for "translat*um*" here.

<span id="P4191_728640"></span> <sup>126</sup> See Gen. vii. 1.

<span id="P4194_728731"></span> <sup>127</sup> Loosely; 120 years is the
number in Gen. vi. 3.

<span id="P4199_728959"></span> <sup>128</sup> Gente.
