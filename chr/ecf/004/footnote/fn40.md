<span id="P4000_719482"></span> <sup>89</sup> Viro. This use of "*man*"
may be justified, to say nothing of other arguments, from Jer. xliv. 19,
where "*our men*" seem plainly = "our husbands." See marg.

<span id="P4002_719650"></span> <sup>90</sup> Virgo: a play on the word
in connection with the "viro" and what follows.

<span id="P4003_719743"></span> <sup>91</sup> Vir.

<span id="P4006_719819"></span> <sup>92</sup> i.e., Adam's. The
constructions, as will be seen, are oddly confused throughout, and I
rather suspect some transposition of lines.

<span id="P4008_720006"></span> <sup>93</sup> Mulier.

<span id="P4009_720037"></span> <sup>94</sup> Mariti.

<span id="P4015_720279"></span> <sup>95</sup> See 1 Cor. xv. 22 sqq.,
especially 45, 47.

<span id="P4019_720424"></span> <sup>96</sup> Acres gressus.

<span id="P4026_720711"></span> <sup>97</sup> Femina.

<span id="P4028_720775"></span> <sup>98</sup> Lavacri.

<span id="P4036_721112"></span> <sup>99</sup> "Os;" lit., "face" or
"mouth."

<span id="P4039_721262"></span> <sup>100</sup> Terra.

<span id="P4053_721838"></span> <sup>101</sup> This would seem to refer
to Lazarus; but it seems to be an assumption that his raising took place
on a Sabbath.

<span id="P4065_722393"></span> <sup>102</sup> i.e., to life.

<span id="P4079_722887"></span> <sup>103</sup> I have ventured to alter
the "*M*orti," of the edd. into "*F*orti;" and "causas" (as we have
seen) seems, in this late Latin, nearly = "res."

<span id="P4081_723076"></span> <sup>104</sup> i.e., the grain.

<span id="P4083_723163"></span> <sup>105</sup> This may seem an unusual
expression, as it is more common to regard the fruit as gracing the
tree, than the tree the fruit. But, in point of fact, the tree, with its
graceful form and foliage, may be said to give a grace to the fruit; and
so our author puts it here: "decoratos arbore fructus."

<span id="P4095_723973"></span> <sup>106</sup> I read "prim*um*" here
for "prim*us*."
