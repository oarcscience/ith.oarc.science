##  Book II.

Very lately, best beloved fellow-servant in the Lord, I, as my ability
permitted, entered for your benefit at some length into the question
what course is to be followed by a holy woman when her marriage has (in
whatever way) been brought to an end. Let us now turn our attention to
the next best advice, in regard of human infirmity; admonished hereto by
the examples of certain, who, when an opportunity for the practice of
Continence has been offered them, by divorce, or by the decease of the
husband, have not only thrown away the opportunity of attaining so great
a good, but not even in their remarriage have chosen to be mindful of
the rule that "above all<sup>[1](footnote/fn8.md)</sup> they marry in the
Lord." And thus my mind has been thrown into confusion, in the fear
that, having exhorted you myself to perseverance in single husbandhood
and widowhood, I may now, by the mention of
precipitate<sup>[2](footnote/fn8.htm#P841_200864.md)</sup> marriages, put
"an occasion of falling"<sup>[3](footnote/fn8.htm#P842_200919.md)</sup> in
your way. But if you are perfect in wisdom, you know, of course, that
the course which is the more useful is the course which you must keep.
But, inasmuch as that course is difficult, and not without its
embarrassments,<sup>[4](footnote/fn8.htm#P843_201292.md)</sup> and on this
account is the highest aim of (widowed) life, I have paused somewhat (in
my urging you to it); nor would there have been any causes for my
recurring to that point also in addressing you, had I not by this time
taken up a still graver solicitude. For the nobler is the continence of
the flesh which ministers to widowhood, the more pardonable a thing it
seems if it be not persevered in. For it is then when things are
difficult that their pardon is easy. But in as far as marrying "in the
Lord" is permissible, as being within our power, so far more culpable is
it *not* to observe that which you *can* observe. Add to this the fact
that the apostle, with regard to widows and the unmarried, *advises*
them to remain permanently in that state, when he says, "But I desire
all to persevere in (imitation of) my example:
"<sup>[5](footnote/fn8.htm#P844_202138.md)</sup> but touching marrying "in
the Lord," he no longer *advises*, but
plainly<sup>[6](footnote/fn8.htm#P845_202229.md)</sup>
*bids*.<sup>[7](footnote/fn8.htm#P846_202306.md)</sup> Therefore in this
case especially, if we do not obey, we run a risk, because one may with
more impunity neglect an "advice" than an "order; "in that the former
springs from *counsel*, and is proposed to the *will* (for acceptance or
rejection): the other descends from *authority*, and is bound to
necessity. In the former case, to disregard appears *liberty*, in the
latter, *contumacy*.

Therefore, when in these days a certain woman removed her marriage from
the pale of the Church, and united herself to a Gentile, and when I
remembered that this had in days gone by been done by others: wondering
at either their own waywardness or else the
double-dealing<sup>[8](footnote/fn8.htm#P850_203187.md)</sup> of their
advisers, in that there is no scripture which holds forth a licence of
this deed,-"I wonder," said I, "whether they flatter themselves on the
ground of that passage of the first (Epistle) to the Corinthians, where
it is written: If any of the brethren has an unbelieving wife, and she
consents to the matrimony, let him not dismiss her; similarly, let not a
believing woman, married to an unbeliever, if she finds her husband
agreeable (to their continued union), dismiss him: for the unbelieving
husband is sanctified by the believing wife, and the unbelieving wife by
the believing husband; else were your children
unclean."<sup>[9](footnote/fn8.htm#P851_203935.md)</sup> It may be that, by
understanding *generally* this monition regarding *married* believers,
they think that licence is granted (thereby) to marry even unbelievers.
God forbid that he who thus interprets (the passage) be *wittingly*
ensnaring himself! But it is manifest that this scripture points to
those believers who may have been found by the grace of God in (the
state of) Gentile matrimony; according to the words themselves: "If," it
says, "any believer *has* an unbelieving wife; "it does not say,
"*takes* an unbelieving wife." It shows that it is the duty of one who,
already living in marriage with an unbelieving
woman,<sup>[10](footnote/fn8.htm#P852_204603.md)</sup> has presently been
by the grace of God converted, to continue with his wife; for this
reason, to be sure, in order that no one, after attaining to faith,
should think that he must turn away from a
woman<sup>[11](footnote/fn8.htm#P853_204821.md)</sup> who is now in some
sense an "alien" and
"stranger."<sup>[12](footnote/fn8.htm#P854_204886.md)</sup> Accordingly he
subjoins withal a reason, that "we are called *in peace* unto the Lord
God; "and that "the unbeliever may, through the use of matrimony, *be
gained* by the believer."<sup>[13](footnote/fn8.htm#P855_205092.md)</sup>
The very closing sentence of the period confirms (the supposition) that
this is thus to be understood. "As each," it says, "is called by the
Lord, so let him
persevere."<sup>[14](footnote/fn8.htm#P856_205348.md)</sup> But it is
*Gentiles* who "are called," I take it, not *believers*. But if he had
been pronouncing *absolutely*, (in the words under discussion,) touching
the marriage of believers merely, (then) had he (virtually) given to
saints a permission to marry promiscuously. If, however, he had given
such a permission, he would never have subjoined a declaration so
diverse from and contrary to his own permission, saying: "The woman,
when her husband is dead, is free: let her marry whom. she wishes, *only
in the Lord*."<sup>[15](footnote/fn8.htm#P857_205928.md)</sup> Here, at all
events, there is no need for reconsidering; for what there *might* have
been reconsideration about, the Spirit has oracularly declared. For fear
we should make an ill use of what he says, "Let her marry whom she
wishes," he has added, "only in the Lord," that is, in the name of the
Lord, which is, undoubtedly, "to a Christian." That "Holy
Spirit,"<sup>[16](footnote/fn8.htm#P858_206324.md)</sup> therefore, who
prefers that widows and unmarried women should persevere in their
integrity, who exhorts us to a
copy<sup>[17](footnote/fn8.htm#P859_206564.md)</sup> of himself, prescribes
no other manner of repeating marriage except "in the Lord: "to this
condition alone does he concede the
foregoing<sup>[18](footnote/fn8.htm#P860_206796.md)</sup> of continence.
"*Only*," he says, "in the Lord: "he has added to his law a
weight-"only." Utter that word with what tone and manner you may, it is
weighty: it both bids and advises; both enjoins and exhorts; both asks
and threatens. It is a
concise,<sup>[19](footnote/fn8.htm#P861_207061.md)</sup> brief sentence;
and by its own very brevity, eloquent. Thus is the divine voice wont (to
speak), that you may instantly understand, instantly observe. For who
but could understand that the apostle foresaw many dangers and wounds to
faith in marriages of this kind, which he prohibits? sad that he took
precaution, in the first place, against the defilement of holy flesh in
Gentile flesh? At this point some one says, "What, then, is the
difference between him who is chosen by the Lord to Himself in (the
state of) Gentile marriage, and him who was of old (that is, before
marriage) a believer, that they should not be equally cautious for their
flesh?-whereas the one is kept from marriage with an unbeliever, the
other bidden to continue in it. Why, if we are defiled by a Gentile, is
not the one disjoined, just as the other is not bound? "I will answer,
if the Spirit give (me ability); alleging, before all (other arguments),
that the Lord holds it more pleasing that matrimony should not be
contracted, than that it should at all be dissolved: in short, divorce
He prohibits, except for the cause of fornication; but continence He
commends. Let the one, therefore, have the necessity of continuing; the
other, further, even the power of not marrying. Secondly, if, according
to the Scripture, they who shall be
"apprehended"<sup>[20](footnote/fn8.htm#P862_208444.md)</sup> by the faith
in (the state of) Gentile marriage are not defiled (thereby) for this
reason, that, together with themselves,
others<sup>[21](footnote/fn8.htm#P863_208621.md)</sup> also are sanctified:
without doubt, they who have been sanctified *before* marriage, if they
commingle themselves with "strange
flesh,"<sup>[22](footnote/fn8.htm#P864_208780.md)</sup> cannot sanctify
that (flesh) in (union with) which they were not "apprehended." The
grace of God, moreover, sanctifies that which it *finds*. Thus, what has
not been able to be sanctified is unclean; what is unclean has no part
with the holy, unless to defile and slay it by its own (nature).

If these things are so, it is certain that believers contracting
marriages with Gentiles are guilty of
fornication,<sup>[23](footnote/fn8.htm#P868_209361.md)</sup> and are to be
excluded from all communication with the brotherhood, in accordance with
the letter of the apostle, who says that "with persons of that kind
there is to be no taking of food
even."<sup>[24](footnote/fn8.htm#P869_209611.md)</sup> Or shall we "in that
day"<sup>[25](footnote/fn8.htm#P870_209662)</sup> produce (our.md) marriage
certificates before the Lord's tribunal, and allege that a marriage such
as He Himself has forbidden has been duly contracted? What is prohibited
(in the passage just referred to) is not "adultery; "It is not
"fornication." The admission of a strange man (to your couch) less
violates "the temple of
God,"<sup>[26](footnote/fn8.htm#P871_210081.md)</sup> less commingles "the
members of Christ" with the members of an
adulteress.<sup>[27](footnote/fn8.htm#P872_210191.md)</sup> So far as I
know, "we are not our own, but bought with a price;
"<sup>[28](footnote/fn8.htm#P873_210277.md)</sup> and what kind of price?
The blood of God.<sup>[29](footnote/fn8.htm#P874_210343.md)</sup> In
hurting this flesh of ours, therefore, we hurt Him
directly.<sup>[30](footnote/fn8.htm#P875_210498.md)</sup> What did that man
mean who said that "to wed a 'stronger' was indeed a sin, but a very
small one? "whereas in other cases (setting aside the injury done to the
flesh which pertains to the Lord) *every* voluntary sin against the Lord
is *great*. For, in as far as there was a power of avoiding it, in so
far is it burdened with the charge of contumacy.

Let us now recount the other dangers or wounds (as I have said) to
faith, foreseen by the apostle; most grievous not to the flesh merely,
but likewise to the spirit too. For who would doubt that faith undergoes
a daily process of obliteration by unbelieving intercourse? "Evil
confabulations corrupt good morals;
"<sup>[31](footnote/fn8.htm#P877_211261.md)</sup> how much more fellowship
of life, and indivisible intimacy! Any and every believing woman must of
necessity obey God. And how can she serve two
lords<sup>[32](footnote/fn8.htm#P878_211527.md)</sup> -the Lord, and her
husband-a Gentile to boot? For in obeying a Gentile she will carry out
Gentile practices,-personal attractiveness, dressing of the head,
worldly<sup>[33](footnote/fn8.htm#P879_211730.md)</sup> elegancies, baser
blandishments, the very secrets even of matrimony tainted: not, as among
the saints, where the duties of the sex are discharged with honour
(shown) to the very necessity (which makes them incumbent), with modesty
and temperance, as beneath the eyes of God.

But let her see to (the question) how she discharges her duties to her
husband. To the Lord, at all events, she is unable to give satisfaction
according to the requirements of discipline; having at her side a
servant of the devil, *his* lord's agent for hindering the pursuits and
duties of believers: so that if a
station<sup>[34](footnote/fn8.htm#P883_212424.md)</sup> is to be kept, the
husband at daybreak makes an appointment with his wife to meet him at
the baths; if there are fasts to be observed, the husband that same day
holds a convivial banquet; if a charitable expedition has to be made,
never is family business more urgent. For who would suffer his wife, for
the sake of visiting the brethren, to go round from street to street to
other men's, and indeed to all the poorer, cottages? Who will willingly
bear her being taken from his side by nocturnal convocations, if need so
be? Who, finally, will without anxiety endure her absence all the night
long at the paschal solemnities? Who will, without some suspicion of his
own, dismiss her to attend that Lord's Supper which they defame? Who
will suffer her to creep into prison to kiss a martyr's bonds? nay,
truly, to meet any one of the brethren to exchange the kiss? to offer
water for the saints' feet?<sup>[35](footnote/fn8.htm#P884_213379.md)</sup>
to snatch (somewhat for them) from her food, from her cup? to yearn
(after them)? to have (them) in her mind? If a pilgrim brother arrive,
what hospitality for him in an alien home? If bounty is to be
distributed to any, the granaries, the storehouses, are foreclosed.

"But some husband does endure our (practices), and not annoy us."
*Here*, therefore, there is a sin; in that Gentiles *know* our
(practices); in that we are subject to the privity of the unjust; in
that it is thanks to them that we do any (good) work. He who "endures"
(a thing) cannot be ignorant of it; or else, if he is kept in ignorance
because he does *not* endure (it), he is feared. But since Scripture
commands each of two things-namely, that we work for the Lord without
the privity of any second
person,<sup>[36](footnote/fn8.htm#P888_214243.md)</sup> and without
pressure upon ourselves, it matters not in which quarter you sin;
whether in regard to your husband's privity, if he be tolerant, or else
in regard of your own affliction in avoiding his intolerance. "Cast
not," saith He, "your pearls to swine, lest they trample them to pieces,
and turn round and overturn you
also."<sup>[37](footnote/fn8.htm#P889_214599.md)</sup> "Your pearls" are
the distinctive marks<sup>[38](footnote/fn8.htm#P890_214658.md)</sup> of
even your daily conversation. The more care you take to conceal them,
the more liable to suspicion you will make them, and the more exposed to
the grasp of Gentile curiosity. Shall you escape notice when you sign
your bed, (or) your body; when you blow away some
impurity;<sup>[39](footnote/fn8.htm#P891_214949.md)</sup> when even by
night you rise to pray? Will you not be-thought to be engaged in some
work of magic? Will not your husband know what it is which you secretly
taste before (taking) any food? and if he knows it to be bread, does he
not believe it to be *that* (bread) which it is *said* to be? And will
every (husband), ignorant of the reason of these things, simply endure
them, without murmuring, without suspicion whether it be bread or
poison? Some, (it is true,) *do* endure (them); but it is that they may
trample on, that they may make sport of such women; whose secrets they
keep in reserve against the danger which they believe in, in case they
ever chance to be hurt: they do endure (wives), whose dowries, by
casting in their teeth their (Christian) name, they make the wages of
silence; while they threaten them, forsooth, with a suit before some
spy<sup>[40](footnote/fn8.htm#P892_215839.md)</sup> as arbitrator! which
most women, not foreseeing, have been wont to discover either by the
extortion of their property, or else by the loss of their faith.

The handmaid of God<sup>[41](footnote/fn8.htm#P896_216145.md)</sup> dwells
amid alien labours; and among these (labours), on all the memorial
days<sup>[42](footnote/fn8.htm#P897_216288.md)</sup> of demons, at all
solemnities of kings, at the beginning of the year, at the beginning of
the month, she will be agitated by the odour of incense. And she will
have to go forth (from her house) by a gate wreathed with laurel, and
hung with lanterns, as from some new consistory of public lusts; she
will have to sit with her husband ofttimes in club meetings, oft-times
in taverns; and, wont as she was formerly to minister to the "saints,"
will sometimes have to minister to the
"unjust."<sup>[43](footnote/fn8.htm#P898_216809.md)</sup> And will she not
hence recognise a prejudgment of her own damnation, in that she *tends*
them whom (formerly) she was expecting to
*judge*?<sup>[44](footnote/fn8.htm#P899_217033.md)</sup> whose hand will
she yearn after? of whose cup will she partake? What will her husband
sing<sup>[45](footnote/fn9.htm#P900_217149.md)</sup> to her, or she to her
husband? From the tavern, I suppose, she who sups upon
God<sup>[46](footnote/fn9.htm#P901_217251.md)</sup> will hear somewhat!
From hell what mention of God (arises)? what invocation of Christ? Where
are the fosterings of faith by the interspersion of the Scriptures (in
conversation)? Where the Spirit? where refreshment? where the divine
benediction? All things are strange, all inimical, all condemned; aimed
by the Evil One for the attrition of salvation!

If these things may happen to those women also who, having attained the
faith while in (the state of) Gentile matrimony, continue in that state,
still they are excused, as having been "apprehended by
God"<sup>[47](footnote/fn9.htm#P905_218331.md)</sup> in these very
circumstances; and they are *bidden* to persevere in their married
state, and are sanctified, and have hope of "making a
gain"<sup>[48](footnote/fn9.htm#P906_218516.md)</sup> held out to them.
"If, then, a marriage of this kind (contracted *before* conversion)
stands ratified before God, why should not (one contracted *after*
conversion) too go prosperously forward, so as not to be thus harassed
by pressures, and straits, and hindrances, and defilements, having
already (as it has) the partial sanction of divine grace? "Because, on
the one hand, the wife<sup>[49](footnote/fn9.htm#P907_218943.md)</sup> in
the former case, called *from among* the Gentiles to the exercise of
some eminent heavenly virtue, is, by the visible proofs of some marked
(divine) regard, a terror to her Gentile husband, so as to make him less
ready to annoy her, less active in laying snares for her, less diligent
in playing the spy over her. He has felt "mighty
works;<sup>[50](footnote/fn9.htm#P908_219411.md)</sup> he has seen
experimental evidences; he knows her changed for the better: thus even
he himself is, by his fear,<sup>[51](footnote/fn9.htm#P909_219559.md)</sup>
a candidate for God.<sup>[52](footnote/fn9.htm#P910_219593.md)</sup> Thus
men of this kind, with regard to whom the grace of God has established a
familiar intimacy, are more easily "gained." But, on the other hand, to
descend into forbidden ground unsolicited and spontaneously, is (quite)
another thing. Things which are not pleasing to the Lord, of course
offend the Lord, are of course introduced by the Evil One. A sign hereof
is this fact, that it is *wooers* only who find the Christian name
pleasing; and, accordingly, some heathen men are found not to shrink in
horror from Christian women, just in order to exterminate them, to wrest
them away, to exclude them from the faith. So long as marriage of this
kind is procured by the Evil One, but condemned by God, you have a
reason why you need not doubt that it can in no case be carded to a
prosperous end.

Let us further inquire, as if we were in very deed inquisitors of divine
sentences, whether they be lawfully (thus condemned). Even among the
nations, do not all the strictest lords and most tenacious of discipline
interdict their own slaves from marrying out of their own house?-in
order, of course, that they may not run into lascivious excess, desert
their duties purvey their lords' goods to strangers. Yet, further, have
not (the nations) decided that such women as have, after their
lords'<sup>[53](footnote/fn9.htm#P914_221178.md)</sup> formal warning,
persisted in intercourse with other men's slaves, may be claimed as
slaves? Shall earthly disciplines be held more strict than heavenly
prescripts; so that *Gentile* women, if united to strangers, lose their
liberty; *ours* conjoin to themselves the devil's slaves, and continue
in their (former) position? Forsooth, they will deny that any formal
warning has been given them by the Lord through His own
apostle!<sup>[54](footnote/fn9.htm#P915_221719.md)</sup>

What am I to fasten on as the cause of this madness, except the weakness
of faith, ever prone, to the concupiscences of
worldly<sup>[55](footnote/fn9.htm#P917_222652.md)</sup> joys?-which,
indeed, is chiefly found among the wealthier; for the more any is rich,
and inflated with the name of "matron," the more capacious house does
she require for her burdens, as it were a field wherein ambition may run
its course. To such the churches look paltry. A rich man is a difficult
thing (to find) in the house of
God;<sup>[56](footnote/fn9.htm#P918_223007.md)</sup> and if such an one is
(found there), difficult (is it to find such) unmarried. What, then, are
they to do? Whence but from the devil are they to seek a husband apt for
maintaining their sedan, and their mules, and their hair-curlers of
outlandish stature? A Christian, even although rich, would perhaps not
afford (all) these. Set before yourself, I beg of you, the examples of
Gentiles. Most Gentile women, noble in extraction and wealthy in
property, unite themselves indiscriminately with the ignoble and the
mean, sought out for themselves for luxurious, or mutilated for
licentious, purposes. Some take up with their own freedmen and slaves,
despising public opinion, provided they may but have (husbands) from
whom to fear no impediment to their own liberty. To a Christian believer
it is irksome to wed a believer inferior to herself in estate, destined
as she will be to have her wealth augmented in the person of a poor
husband! For if it is "the pour," not the rich, "whose are the kingdoms
of the heavens,"<sup>[57](footnote/fn9.htm#P919_224103.md)</sup> the rich
will find more in the poor (than she brings him, or than she would in
the rich). She will be dowered with an ampler dowry from the goods of
him who is rich in God. Let her be on an equality with him. on earth,
who in the heavens will perhaps not be so. Is there need for doubt, and
inquiry, and repeated deliberation, whether he whom God has entrusted
with His own property<sup>[58](footnote/fn9.htm#P920_224654.md)</sup> is
fit for dotal endowments?<sup>[59](footnote/fn9.htm#P921_224696.md)</sup>
Whence are we to find (words) enough fully to tell the happiness of that
marriage which the Church cements, and the oblation confirms, and the
benediction signs and seals; (which) angels carry back the news of (to
heaven), (which) the Father holds for ratified? For even on earth
children<sup>[60](footnote/fn9.htm#P922_225031.md)</sup> do not rightly and
lawfully wed without their fathers' consent. What kind of yoke is that
of two believers, (partakers) of one hope, one
desire,<sup>[61](footnote/fn9.htm#P923_225188.md)</sup> one discipline, one
and the same service? Both (are) brethren, both fellow servants, no
difference of spirit or of flesh; nay, (they are) truly "two in one
flesh."<sup>[62](footnote/fn9.htm#P924_225436.md)</sup> Where the flesh is
one, one is the spirit ton. Together they pray, together prostrate
themselves, together perform their fasts; mutually teaching, mutually
exhorting,<sup>[63](footnote/fn9.htm#P925_225658.md)</sup> mutually
sustaining. Equally (are they) both (found) in the Church of God;
equally at the banquet of God; equally in straits, in persecutions, in
refreshments. Neither hides (ought) from the other; neither shuns the
other; neither is troublesome to the other. The sick is visited, the
indigent relieved, with freedom. Alms (are given) without (danger of
ensuing) torment; sacrifices (attended) without scruple; daily diligence
(discharged) without impediment: (there is) no stealthy signing, no
trembling greeting, no mute benediction. Between the two echo psalms and
hymns;<sup>[64](footnote/fn9.htm#P926_226252.md)</sup> and they mutually
challenge each other which shall better chant to their Lord. Such things
when Christ sees and hears, He joys. To these He sends His own I
peace.<sup>[65](footnote/fn9.htm#P927_226446)</sup> Where two (are.md),
there withal (is) He
Himself.<sup>[66](footnote/fn9.htm#P928_226518)</sup> Where He (is.md),
there the Evil One is not.

These are the things which that utterance of the apostle has, beneath
its brevity, left to be understood by us. These things, if need shall
be, suggest to your own mind. By these turn yourself away from the
examples of some. To marry *otherwise* is, to believers, not "lawful;
"is not "expedient."<sup>[67](footnote/fn9.htm#P930_226878.md)</sup>
