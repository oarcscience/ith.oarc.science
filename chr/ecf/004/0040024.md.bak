##  Elucidations.

I

Persecutions threaten, p. 116.

We have reserved this heroic tract to close our series of the ascetic
essays of our author because it places even his sophistical enthusiasm
in a light which shows much to admire. Strange that this defiant hero
should have died (as we may infer) in his bed, and in extreme old age.
Great man, how much, alike for weal and woe, the ages have been taught
by thee!

This is the place for a tabular view of the *ten persecutions* of the
Ante-Nicene Church. They are commonly enumerated as
follows:<sup>[61](footnote/fn20.htm#P2015_617072.md)</sup> -

*Periods of Comparative Rest*.

5\. Under Diocletian a.d. 284 till a.d. 303.

In thus chastising and sifting his Church in the years of her gradual
growth "from the smallest of all seeds," we see illustrations of the
Lord's Epistles to the seven churches of the Apocalypse. Who can doubt
that Tertullian's writings prepared the North-African Church for the
Decian furnace, and all believers for the "seven times hotter" fires of
Diocletian?

II

To the fearful, p. 120.

In the *Patientia*<sup>[62](footnote/fn20.htm#P2037_618050.md)</sup>
Tertullian reflects the views of Catholics, and seems to allow those
"persecuted in one city to flee to another." So also in the Ad
Uxorem,<sup>[63](footnote/fn20.htm#P2038_618206.md)</sup> as instanced by
Kaye.<sup>[64](footnote/fn20.htm#P2039_618246.md)</sup> In the *Fuga* we
have the enthusiast, but not as Gibbon will have
it,<sup>[65](footnote/fn20.htm#P2040_618332.md)</sup> the most wild and
fanatical of declaimers. On the whole subject we again refer our readers
to the solid and sober comments of Kaye on the martyrdoms and
persecutions of the early faithful, and on the patristic views of the
same.

III

Enormous gains from numbers, p. 124.

Christians were now counted by millions. The following tabular view of
the Christian population of the world from the beginning has been
attributed to *Sharon Turner*. I do not find it in any of his works with
which I am familiar. The *nineteenth century* is certainly credited too
low, according to the modern computists; but I insert it merely for the
centuries we are now considering.

Growth of the Church in Numbers.

19\. Nineteenth century 400,000,000
