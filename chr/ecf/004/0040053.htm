<p>  <h2 align="CENTER"><a></a> Elucidation.</h2>  
<p>This golden letter, doubtless genuine, was attended with very great consequences, of which we shall gather more hereafter. It is worthy of the solemn consideration of young students to whom this page may come. Gregory was unbaptized when Origen (circa a.d. 230) thus addressed his conscience.</p>  
<p>On the letters here inserted, let me refer the student to Routh, <i>Reliqu</i>., ii. pp. 312-327; also same vol., pp. 222-228; also iii. 254-256.</p>  
<p>For the facts concerning this letter to Gregory, see Cave, i. p. 400. </p>
