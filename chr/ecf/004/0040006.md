##  Book I.

If there dwelt upon earth a faith as great as is the reward of faith
which is expected in the heavens, no one of you at all, best beloved
sisters, from the time that she had first "known the
Lord,"<sup>[1](footnote/fn2)</sup> and learned (the truth.md) concerning
her own (that is, woman's) condition, would have desired too gladsome
(not to say too ostentatious) a style of dress; so as not rather to go
about in humble garb, and rather to affect meanness of appearance,
walking about as Eve mourning and repentant, in order that by every garb
of penitence<sup>[2](footnote/fn2.htm#P268_52787.md)</sup> she might the
more fully expiate that which she derives from Eve,-the ignominy, I
mean, of the first sin, and the odium (attaching to her as the cause) of
human perdition. "In pains and in anxieties dost thou bear (children),
woman; and toward thine husband (is) thy inclination, and he lords It
over thee."<sup>[3](footnote/fn2.htm#P269_53114.md)</sup> And do you not
know that you are (each) an Eve? The sentence of God on this sex of
yours lives in this age:<sup>[4](footnote/fn2.htm#P270_53270.md)</sup> the
guilt must of necessity live too. *You* are the devil's gateway: *you*
are the unsealer<sup>[5](footnote/fn2.htm#P271_53370.md)</sup> of that
(forbidden) tree: *you* are the first deserter of the divine law: *you*
are she who persuaded<sup>[6](footnote/fn2.htm#P272_53538.md)</sup> him
whom the devil was not valiant enough to attack. *You* destroyed so
easily God's image, man. On account of *your* desert-that is, death-even
the Son of God had to die. And do you think about adorning yourself over
and above your tunics of
skins?<sup>[7](footnote/fn2.htm#P273_53882.md)</sup> Come, now; if from the
beginning of the world<sup>[8](footnote/fn2.htm#P274_53949.md)</sup> the
Milesians sheared sheep, and the
Serians<sup>[9](footnote/fn2.htm#P275_54004.md)</sup> spun trees, and the
Tyrians dyed, and the Phrygians embroidered with the needle, and the
Babylonians with the loom, and pearls gleamed, and onyx-stones flashed;
if gold itself also had already issued, with the cupidity (which
accompanies it), from the ground; if the mirror, too, already had
licence to lie so largely, Eve, expelled from paradise, (Eve) already
dead, would also have coveted *these* things, I imagine! No more, then,
ought she *now* to crave, or be acquainted with (if she desires to live
again), what, when she *was* living, she had neither had nor known.
Accordingly these things are all the baggage of woman in her condemned
and dead state, instituted as if to swell the pomp of her funeral.

For they, withal, who instituted them are assigned, under condemnation,
to the penalty of death,-those angels, to wit, who rushed from heaven on
the daughters of men; so that this ignominy also attaches to woman. For
when to an age<sup>[11](footnote/fn2.htm#P280_55168.md)</sup> much more
ignorant (than ours) they had disclosed certain well-concealed material
substances, and several not well-revealed scientific arts-if it is true
that they had laid bare the operations of metallurgy, and had divulged
the natural properties of herbs, and had promulgated the powers of
enchantments, and had traced out every curious
art,<sup>[12](footnote/fn2.htm#P281_55527.md)</sup> even to the
interpretation of the stars-they conferred properly and as it were
peculiarly upon women that instrumental mean of womanly ostentation, the
radiances of jewels wherewith necklaces are variegated, and the circlets
of gold wherewith the arms are compressed, and the medicaments of orchil
with which wools are coloured, and that black powder itself wherewith
the eyelids and eyelashes are made
prominent.<sup>[13](footnote/fn2.htm#P282_56002.md)</sup> What is the
quality of these things may be declared meantime, even at this
point,<sup>[14](footnote/fn2.htm#P283_56136.md)</sup> from the quality and
condition of their teachers: in that sinners could never have either
shown or supplied anything conducive to integrity, unlawful lovers
anything conducive to chastity, renegade spirits anything conducive to
the fear of God. If (these things) are to be called *teachings*, ill
masters must of necessity have taught ill; if as *wages of lust*, there
is nothing base of which the wages are honourable. But why was it of so
much importance to show these things as well
as<sup>[15](footnote/fn2.htm#P284_56688.md)</sup> to confer them? Was it
that women, without material causes of splendour, and without ingenious
contrivances of grace, could not please *men*, who, while still
unadorned, and uncouth and-so to say-crude and rude, had moved (the mind
of) *angels*? or was it that the
lovers<sup>[16](footnote/fn2.htm#P285_56999.md)</sup> would appear sordid
and-through gratuitous use-contumelious, if they had conferred no
(compensating) gift on the women who had been enticed into connubial
connection with them? But these questions admit of no calculation. Women
who possessed angels (as husbands) could desire nothing more; they had,
forsooth, made a grand match! Assuredly they who, of course, did
sometimes think whence they had
fallen,<sup>[17](footnote/fn2.htm#P286_57435.md)</sup> and, after the
heated impulses of their lusts, looked up toward heaven, thus requited
that very excellence of women, natural beauty, as (having proved) a
cause of evil, in order that their good fortune might profit them
nothing; but that, being turned from simplicity and sincerity, they,
together with (the angels) themselves, might become offensive to God.
Sure they were that all ostentation, and ambition, and love of pleasing
by carnal means, was displeasing to God. And these are the angels whom
we are destined to judge:<sup>[18](footnote/fn2.htm#P287_57986.md)</sup>
these are the angels whom in baptism we
renounce:<sup>[19](footnote/fn2.htm#P288_58059.md)</sup> these, of course,
are the reasons why they have deserved to be judged by man. What
business, then, have their *things* with their *judges*? What commerce
have they who are to condemn with them who are to be condemned? The
same, I take it, as Christ has with
Belial.<sup>[20](footnote/fn2.htm#P289_58349.md)</sup> With what
consistency do we mount that (future) judgment-seat to pronounce
sentence against those whose gifts we (now) seek after? For you too,
(women as you are, ) have the self-same angelic nature
promised<sup>[21](footnote/fn2.htm#P290_58586.md)</sup> as your reward, the
self-same sex as men: the self-same advancement to the dignity of
judging, does (the Lord) promise you. Unless, then, we begin even here
to prejudge, by pre-condemning their *things*, which we are hereafter to
condemn in *themselves*, they will rather judge and condemn us.

I am aware that the Scripture of
Enoch,<sup>[23](footnote/fn2.htm#P295_59083.md)</sup> which has assigned
this order (of action) to angels, is not received by some, because it is
not admitted into the Jewish canon either. I suppose they did not think
that, having been published before the deluge, it could have safely
survived that world-wide calamity, the abolisher of all things. If that
is the reason (for rejecting it), let them recall to their memory that
Noah, the survivor of the deluge, was the great-grandson of Enoch
himself;<sup>[24](footnote/fn2.htm#P296_59561.md)</sup> and he, of course,
had heard and remembered, from domestic
renown<sup>[25](footnote/fn2.htm#P297_59660.md)</sup> and hereditary
tradition, concerning his own great-grandfather's "grace in the sight of
God,"<sup>[26](footnote/fn2.htm#P298_59790.md)</sup> and concerning all his
preachings;<sup>[27](footnote/fn2.htm#P299_59848.md)</sup> since Enoch had
given no other charge to Methuselah than that he should hand on the
knowledge of them to his posterity. Noah therefore, no doubt, might have
succeeded in the trusteeship of (his) preaching; or, had the case been
otherwise, he would not have been silent alike concerning the
disposition (of things) made by God, his Preserver, and concerning the
particular glory of his own house.

If (Noah) had not had this (conservative power) by so short a route,
there would (still) be this (consideration) to
warrant<sup>[28](footnote/fn3.htm#P301_60385.md)</sup> our assertion of
(the genuineness of) this Scripture: he could equally have *renewed* it,
under the Spirit's
inspiration,<sup>[29](footnote/fn3.htm#P302_60520.md)</sup> after it *had*
been destroyed by the violence of the deluge, as, after the destruction
of Jerusalem by the Babylonian storming of it, every
document<sup>[30](footnote/fn3.htm#P303_60685.md)</sup> of the Jewish
literature is generally agreed to have been restored through Ezra.

But since Enoch in the same Scripture has preached likewise concerning
the Lord, nothing at all must be rejected *by* us which pertains *to*
us; and we read that "every Scripture suitable for edification is
divinely inspired.<sup>[31](footnote/fn3.htm#P305_61006.md)</sup> By the
*Jews* it may now seem to have been rejected for that (very) reason,
just like all the other (portions) nearly which tell of Christ. Nor, of
course, is this fact wonderful, that they did not receive some
Scriptures which spake of Him whom even in person, speaking in their
presence, they were not to receive. To these considerations is added the
fact that Enoch possesses a testimony in the Apostle
Jude.<sup>[32](footnote/fn3.htm#P306_61441.md)</sup>

Grant now that no mark of pre-condemnation has been branded on womanly
pomp by the (fact of the)
fate<sup>[33](footnote/fn3.htm#P310_61677.md)</sup> of its authors; let
nothing be imputed to those angels besides their repudiation of heaven
and (their) carnal marriage:<sup>[34](footnote/fn3.htm#P311_61809.md)</sup>
let us examine the qualities of the things themselves, in order that we
may detect the purposes also for which they are eagerly desired.

Female habit carries with it a twofold idea-dress and ornament. By
"dress" we mean what they call "womanly gracing;
"<sup>[35](footnote/fn3.htm#P313_62088.md)</sup> by "ornament," what it is
suitable should be called "womanly
disgracing."<sup>[36](footnote/fn3.htm#P314_62206.md)</sup> The former is
accounted (to consist) in gold, and silver, and gems, and garments; the
latter in care of the hair, and of the skin, and of those parts of the
body which attract the eye. Against the one we lay the charge of
ambition, against the other of prostitution; so that even from this
early stage<sup>[37](footnote/fn3.htm#P315_62533.md)</sup> (of our
discussion) you may look forward and see what, out of (all) these, is
suitable, handmaid of God, to *your* discipline, inasmuch as you are
assessed on different principles (from other women),-those, namely, of
humility and chastity.

Gold and silver, the principal material causes of
worldly<sup>[38](footnote/fn3.htm#P319_62980.md)</sup> splendour, must
necessarily be identical (in nature) with that out of which they have
their being: (they must be) earth, that is; (which earth itself is)
plainly more glorious (than they), inasmuch as it is only after it has
been tearfully wrought by penal labour in the deadly laboratories of
accursed mines, and there left its name of "earth" in the fire behind
it, that, as a fugitive from the mine, it passes from torments to
ornaments, from punishments to embellishments, from ignominies to
honours. But iron, and brass, and other the vilest material substances,
enjoy a parity of condition (with silver and gold), both as to earthly
origin and metallurgic operation; in order that, in the estimation of
nature, the substance of gold and of silver may be judged not a whit
more noble (than theirs). But if it is from the quality of *utility*
that gold and silver derive their glory, why, iron and brass excel them;
whose usefulness is so disposed (by the Creator), that they not only
discharge functions of their own more numerous and more necessary to
human affairs, but do also none the less serve the turn of gold and
silver, by dint of their own
powers,<sup>[39](footnote/fn3.htm#P320_64158.md)</sup> in the service of
juster causes. For not only are rings made of iron, but the memory of
antiquity still preserves (the fame of) certain vessels for eating and
drinking made out of brass. Let the insane plenteousness of gold and
silver look to it, if it serves to make utensils even for foul purposes.
At all events, neither is the field tilled by means of gold, nor the
ship fastened together by the strength of silver. No mattock plunges a
golden edge into the ground; no nail drives a silver point into planks.
I leave unnoticed the fact that the needs of our whole life are
dependent upon iron and brass; whereas those rich materials themselves,
requiring both to be dug up out of mines, and needing a forging process
in every use (to which they are put), are helpless without the laborious
vigour of iron and brass. Already, therefore, we must judge whence it is
that so high dignity accrues to gold and silver, since they get
precedence over material substances which are not only cousin-german to
them in point of origin, but more powerful in point of usefulness.

But, in the next place, what am I to interpret those jewels to be which
vie with gold in haughtiness, except little pebbles and stones and
paltry particles of the self-same earth; but yet not necessary either
for laying down foundations, or rearing party-walls, or supporting
pediments, or giving density to roofs? The only edifice which they know
how to rear is this silly pride of women: because they require slow
rubbing that they may shine, and artful underlaying that they may show
to advantage, and careful piercing that they may hang; and (because
they) render to gold a mutual assistance in meretricious allurement. But
whatever it is that ambition fishes up from the British or the Indian
sea, it is a kind of conch not more pleasing in *savour* than-I do not
say the oyster and the sea-snail, but-even the giant
muscle.<sup>[40](footnote/fn3.htm#P324_66145.md)</sup> For let me add that
I know conchs (which axe) sweet fruits of the sea. But if that (foreign)
conch suffers from some internal pustule, that ought to be regarded
rather as its defect than as its glory; and although it be called
"pearl," still something else must be understood than some hard, round
excrescence of the fish. Some say, too, that gems are culled from the
foreheads of *dragons*, just as in the brains of fishes there is a
certain stony substance. This also was wanting to the Christian woman,
that she may add a grace to herself from the serpent! Is it thus that
she will set her heel on the devil's
head,"<sup>[41](footnote/fn3.htm#P325_66827.md)</sup> while she heaps
ornaments (taken) from his head on her own neck, or on her very head?

It is only from their rarity and outlandishness that all these things
possess their grace; in short, within their own native limits they are
not held of so high worth. Abundance is always contumelious toward
itself. There are some barbarians with whom, because gold is indigenous
and plentiful, it is customary to keep (the criminals) in their convict
establishments chained with gold, and to lade the wicked with riches-the
more guilty, the more wealthy. At last there has really been found a way
to prevent even gold from being loved! We have also seen at Rome the
nobility of gems blushing in the presence of our matrons at the
contemptuous usage of the Parthians and Medes, and the rest of their own
fellow-countrymen, only that (*their* gems) are not generally worn with
a view to ostentation.
Emeralds<sup>[42](footnote/fn3.htm#P329_67809.md)</sup> lurk in their
belts; and the sword (that hangs) below their bosom alone is witness to
the cylindrical stones that decorate its hilt; and the massive single
pearls on their boots are fain to get lifted out of the mud! In short,
they carry nothing so richly gemmed as that which ought *not* to be
gemmed if it is (either) not conspicuous, or else is conspicuous only
that it may be shown to be also neglected.

Similarly, too, do even the
servants<sup>[43](footnote/fn3.htm#P333_68439.md)</sup> of those barbarians
cause the glory to fade from the colours of our garments (by wearing the
like); nay, even their party-walls use slightingly, to supply the place
of painting, the Tyrian and the violet-coloured and the grand royal
hangings, which you laboriously undo and metamorphose. Purple with them
is more paltry than red ochre; (and justly, ) for what legitimate honour
can garments derive from adulteration with illegitimate colours? That
which He Himself has not produced is not pleasing to God, unless He was
*unable* to order sheep to be born with purple and sky-blue fleeces! If
He was *able*, then plainly He was *unwilling*: what God willed not, of
course ought not to be fashioned. Those things, then, are not the best
by *nature* which are not from God, the *Author* of nature. Thus they
are understood to be from *the devil*, from the *corrupter* of nature:
for there is no other whose they can be, if they are not God's; because
what are not God's must necessarily be His
rival's.<sup>[44](footnote/fn3.htm#P334_69444.md)</sup> But, beside the
devil and his angels, other rival of God there is none. Again, if the
*material substances* are of God, it does not immediately follow that
such ways of *enjoying* them among men (are so too). It is matter for
inquiry not only whence come
conchs,<sup>[45](footnote/fn3.htm#P335_69735.md)</sup> but what sphere of
embellishment is assigned them, and where it is that they exhibit their
beauty. For all those profane pleasures of
worldly<sup>[46](footnote/fn3.htm#P336_69902.md)</sup> shows-as we have
already published a volume of their own about
them<sup>[47](footnote/fn3.htm#P337_69989)</sup> -(ay, and.md) even
idolatry itself, derive their material causes from the
creatures<sup>[48](footnote/fn3.htm#P338_70110.md)</sup> of God. Yet a
Christian ought not to attach
himself<sup>[49](footnote/fn3.htm#P339_70174.md)</sup> to the frenzies of
the racecourse, or the atrocities of the arena, or the turpitudes of the
stage, simply because God has given to man the horse, and the panther,
and the power of speech: just as a Christian cannot commit idolatry with
impunity either, because the incense, and the wine, and the fire which
feeds<sup>[50](footnote/fn3.htm#P340_70554)</sup> (thereon.md), and the
animals which are made the victims, are God's
workmanship;<sup>[51](footnote/fn3.htm#P341_70694.md)</sup> since even the
material thing which is adored is God's (creature). Thus then, too, with
regard to their active use, does the *origin* of the material
substances, which descends from God, *excuse* (that use) as foreign to
God, as guilty forsooth of
worldly<sup>[52](footnote/fn3.htm#P342_70982.md)</sup> glory!

For, as some particular things distributed by God over certain
individual lands, and some one particular tract of sea, are mutually
foreign one to the other, they are reciprocally either neglected or
desired: (desired) among foreigners, as being rarities; neglected
(rightly), if anywhere, among their own compatriots, because in *them*
there is no such fervid longing for a glory which, among its own
home-folk, is frigid. But, however, the rareness and outlandishness
which arise out of that distribution of possessions which God has
ordered as He willed, ever finding favour in the eyes of strangers,
excites, from the simple fact of *not* having what God has made native
to other places, the concupiscence of *having* it. Hence is educed
another vice-that of *immoderate* having; because although, perhaps,
*having* may be permissible, still a
limit<sup>[53](footnote/fn3.htm#P346_71973.md)</sup> is bound (to be
observed). This (second vice) will be ambition; and hence, too, its name
is to be interpreted, in that from concupiscence *ambient* in the mind
it is born, with a view to the desire of glory,-a grand desire,
forsooth, which (as we have said) is recommended neither by nature nor
by truth, but by a vicious passion of the mind,-(namely, )
concupiscence. And there are other vices connected with ambition and
glory. Thus they have withal enhanced the *cost* of things, in order
that (thereby) they might add fuel to themselves also; for concupiscence
becomes proportionably greater as it has set a higher value upon the
thing which it has eagerly desired. From the smallest caskets is
produced an ample patrimony. On a single thread is suspended a million
of sesterces. One delicate neck carries about it forests and
islands.<sup>[54](footnote/fn3.htm#P347_72832.md)</sup> The slender lobes
of the ears exhaust a fortune; and the left hand, with its every finger,
sports with a several money-bag. Such is the strength of
ambition-(equal) to bearing on one small body, and that a woman's, the
product of so copious wealth:
