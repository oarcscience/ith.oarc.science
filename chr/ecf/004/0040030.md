##  5. Five Books in Reply to Marcion.

(Author Uncertain.)

Book I.-Of the Divine Unity, and the Resurrection of the Flesh.

(N.B.-It has been impossible to note the changes which I have had to
make in the text of the Latin. In some cases they will suggest
themselves to any scholar who may compare the translation with the
original; and in others I must be content to await a more fitting
opportunity, if such ever arise, for discussing them.)
