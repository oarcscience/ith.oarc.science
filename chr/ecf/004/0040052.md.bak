##  A Letter from Origen to Gregory.<sup>[1](footnote/fn76.htm#P7609_1761001.md)</sup>

1\. Greeting in God, my most excellent sir, and venerable son Gregory,
from Origen. A natural readiness of comprehension, as you well know,
may, if practice be added, contribute somewhat to the contingent end, if
I may so call it, of that which any one wishes to practise. Thus, your
natural good parts might make of you a finished Roman lawyer or a Greek
philosopher, so to speak, of one of the schools in high reputation. But
I am anxious that you should devote all the strength of your natural
good parts to Christianity for your end; and in order to this, I wish to
ask you to extract from the philosophy of the Greeks what may serve as a
course of study or a preparation for Christianity, and from geometry and
astronomy what will serve to explain the sacred Scriptures, in order
that all that the sons of the philosophers are wont to say about
geometry and music, grammar, rhetoric, and astronomy, as fellow-helpers
to philosophy, we may say about philosophy itself, in relation to
Christianity.

2\. Perhaps something of this kind is shadowed forth in what is written
in Exodus from the mouth of God, that the children of Israel were
commanded to ask from their neighbours, and those who dwelt with them,
vessels of silver and gold, and raiment, in order that, by spoiling the
Egyptians, they might have material for the preparation of the things
which pertained to the service of God. For from the things which the
children of Israel took from the Egyptians the vessels in the holy of
holies were made,-the ark with its lid, and the Cherubim, and the
mercy-seat, and the golden coffer, where was the manna, the angels'
bread. These things were probably made from the best of the Egyptian
gold. An inferior kind would be used for the solid golden candlestick
near the inner veil, and its branches, and the golden table on which
were the pieces of shewbread, and the golden censer between them. And if
there was a third and fourth quality of gold, from it would be made the
holy vessels; and the other things would be made of Egyptian silver. For
when the children of Israel dwelt in Egypt, they gained this from their
dwelling there, that they had no lack of such precious material for the
utensils of the service of God. And of the Egyptian raiment were
probably made all those things which, as the Scripture mentions, needed
sewed and embroidered work, sewed with the wisdom of God, the one to the
other other, that the veils might be made, and the inner and the cuter
courts. And why should I go on, in this untimely digression, to set
forth how useful to the children of Israel were the things brought from
Egypt, which the Egyptians had not put to a proper use, but which the
Hebrews, guided by the wisdom of God, used for God's service? Now the
sacred Scripture is wont to represent as an evil the going down from the
land of the children of Israel into Egypt, indicating that certain
persons get harm from sojourning among the Egyptians, that is to say,
from meddling with the knowledge of this world, after they have
subscribed to the law of God, and the Israelitish service of Him.
Ader<sup>[2](footnote/fn76.htm#P7612_1764198.md)</sup> at least, the
Idumaean; so long as he was in" the land of Israel, and had not tasted
the bread of the Egyptians, made no idols. It was when he fled from the
wise Solomon, and went down into Egypt, as it were flying from the
wisdom of God, and was made a kinsman of Pharaoh by marrying his wife's
sister, and begetting a child, who was brought up with the children of
Pharaoh, that he did this. Wherefore, although he did return to the land
of Israel, he returned only to divide the people of God, and to make
them say to the golden calf, "These be thy gods, 0 Israel, which brought
thee up from the land of
Egypt."<sup>[3](footnote/fn76.htm#P7613_1764896.md)</sup> And I may tell
you from my experience, that not many take from Egypt only the useful,
and go away and use it for the service of God; while Ader the Idumaean
has many brethren. These are they who, from their Greek studies, produce
heretical notions, and set them up, like the' golden calf, in Bethel,
which signifies "God's house." In these words also there seems to me an
indication that they have set up their own imaginations in the
Scriptures, where the word of God dwells, which is called in a figure
Bethel. The other figure, the word says, was set up in Dan. Now the
borders of Dan are the most extreme, and nearest the borders of the
Gentiles, as is clear from what is written in Joshua, the son of Nun.
Now some of the devices of these brethren of Ader, as we call them, are
also very near the borders of the Gentiles.

3\. Do you then, my son, diligently apply yourself to the reading of the
sacred Scriptures. Apply yourself, I say. For we who read the things of
God need much application, lest we should say or think anything too
rashly about them. And applying yourself thus to the study of the things
of God, with faithful prejudgments such as are well pleasing to God,
knock at its locked door, and it will be opened to you by the porter, of
whom Jesus says, "To him the porter
opens."<sup>[4](footnote/fn76.htm#P7615_1766219.md)</sup> And applying
yourself thus to the divine study, seek aright, and with unwavering
trust in God, the meaning of the holy Scriptures, which so many have
missed. Be not satisfied with knocking and seeking; for prayer is of all
things indispensable to the knowledge of the things of God. For to this
the Saviour exhorted, and said not only, "Knock, and it shall be opened
to you; and seek, and ye shall
find,"<sup>[5](footnote/fn76.htm#P7616_1766638.md)</sup> but also, "Ask,
and it shall be given unto
you."<sup>[6](footnote/fn76.htm#P7617_1766704.md)</sup> My fatherly love to
you has made me thus bold; but whether my boldness be good, God will
know, and His Christ, and all partakers of the Spirit of God and the
Spirit of Christ. May you also be a partaker, and be ever increasing
your inheritance, that you may say not only, "We are become partakers of
Christ,"<sup>[7](footnote/fn76.htm#P7618_1767028.md)</sup> but also
partakers of God.
