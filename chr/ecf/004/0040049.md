##  Elucidations.

I

Teaching of the Church, p. 240.

It is noteworthy how frequently our author employs this expression in
this immediate connection. Concerning the punishment of the wicked he
asserts a "clearly defined teaching." He shows what the Church's
teaching "has laid down" touching demons and angels. Touching the origin
of the world, he again asserts the Church's teaching, and then concedes,
that, over and above what he maintains, there is "no clear statement
regarding it,"-i.e., the creation and its antecedents. Elsewhere he
speaks of "the faith of the Church," and all this as something accepted
by all Christians recognised as orthodox or Catholics.

Not to recur to the subject of the creeds<sup>[70](footnote/fn74.md)</sup>
known at this period in the East and West, this frequent recognition of
a system of theology, or something like it, starts some interesting
inquiries. We have space to state only some of them:-

1\. Was Origen here speaking of the catechetical school of Alexandria,
and assuming its teaching to be that of the whole Church?

2\. If so, was not this recognition of the Alexandrian leadership the
precursor of that terrible shock which was given to Christendom by the
rise of Arianism out of such a stronghold of orthodoxy?

3\. Does not the power of Athanasius to stand "against the world" assure
us that he was strong in the position that "the teaching of the Church,"
in Alexandria and elsewhere, was against Arias, whom he was able to
defeat by *prescription* as well as by Scripture?

4\. Is it not clear that all this was asserted, held, and defined
without help from the West, and that the West merely responded *Amen* to
what Alexandria had taught from the beginning?

5\. Is not the evidence overwhelming, that nothing but passive testimony
was thus far heard of in connection with the see of Rome?

6\. If the "teaching of the Church," then, was so far independent of
that see that Christendom neither waited for its voice, nor recognised
it as of any exceptional importance in the definition of the faith and
the elimination of heresy, is it not evident that the entire fabric of
the Middle-Age polity in the West has its origin in times and manners
widely differing from the Apostolic Age and that of the Ante-Nicene
Fathers?

II

Subjection, p. 343.

The *subordination* of the Son, as held by all Nicene Christians, is
defended by Bull<sup>[71](footnote/fn74.htm#P7438_1714695.md)</sup> at
great length and with profound learning. It is my purpose elsewhere to
quote his splendid tribute to the substantial orthodoxy of Origen.
Professor Shedd, in his work on *Christian
Doctrine*,<sup>[72](footnote/fn74.htm#P7439_1714942.md)</sup> pronounces
the Nicene Creed "*the received* creed-statement among all Trinitarian
Churches." I assume that this note will be of interest to all
theological minds. For an unsatisfactory and meagre account of primitive
creeds, see Bunsen, *Hippol*., iii. pp. 125-132.

III

Proceedeth from the Father, p. 344.

The double procession is no part of the Creed of Christendom; nor did it
become fixed in the West, till, by the influence of Charlemagne, the
important but not immaculate Council of Frankfort (a.d. 794) completed
the work of Toledo, and committed the whole West to its support. The
Anglican Church recites the *Filioque* liturgically, but explains its
adhesion to this *formula* in a manner satisfactory to the Easterns. It
has no rightful place in the Creed, however; and its retention in the
Nicene Symbol is a just offence, not only to the Greeks, but against the
great canon, *Quod semper*, etc.

Compare Pearson on the
*Creed*,<sup>[73](footnote/fn74.htm#P7445_1715888.md)</sup> and these
candid words: "Although the addition of words to the formal Creed *be
not justifiable*," etc. Consult the valuable work of Theophanes
Procopowicz, Bishop of Novgorod, which contains a history of the
literature of the subject down to his
times.<sup>[74](footnote/fn74.htm#P7446_1716158.md)</sup> It is a matter
debated anew in our own age, in view of advances to the Greeks made by
Dr. Döllinger and the Old Catholics. Let me refer to a volume almost
equally learned and
ill-digested,<sup>[75](footnote/fn74.htm#P7447_1716413.md)</sup> written by
a clever author who was perverted to Romanism, and returned, after many
years, to the Church of England. It bears the marks of many unreal
impressions received during his "Babylonish captivity." I refer to a
work of E. S. Foulkes.

IV

The faith of the Church, p. 347.

Before the Nicene Council local creeds were in use, all agreeing
substantially; all scriptural, but some more full than others. Of these
the ancient Symbol of Jerusalem was chief, and this forms the base of
the Nicene Creed. It is here noteworthy that Origen speaks of "the
faith" as something settled and known: clearly, he did not intentionally
transgress it. Bull
says,<sup>[76](footnote/fn74.htm#P7452_1717105.md)</sup> "Graeci Scriptores
Ante-Nicaeni to/n kano/na th=j pi/stewj passim in scriptis suis
commemorant." See the Jerusalem Creed, on the same page; and note, the
Church of Jerusalem is called by the Second (Oecumenical Council (a.d.
381), "the mother of all the Churches." So ignorant were the Fathers of
that date of any other "mother Church," that they address this very
statement to the clergy of
Rome.<sup>[77](footnote/fn74.htm#P7453_1717530.md)</sup> Compare Eusebius,
book iv. cap. viii.

V

Endowed with freedom of will, p. 347.

Elsewhere in this treatise our author defines the will as "able to
resist external causes." The profound work of Edwards needs no words of
mine.<sup>[78](footnote/fn74.htm#P7458_1717783.md)</sup> As an example of
logic the most acute, it is the glory of early American literature. I
read it eagerly during my college course, while under the guidance of my
instructor in philosophy, the amiable and profound Dr. Tappan
(afterwards president of the University of Michigan), who taught us to
admire it, but not to regard it as infallible. See his vigorous review
of Edwards,<sup>[79](footnote/fn74.htm#P7459_1718194.md)</sup> in which he
argues as a disciple of Coleridge and of Plato.

On allied subjects, let me refer to Wiggers's Augustinismus, etc.,
translated by Professor Emerson of
Andover;<sup>[80](footnote/fn74.htm#P7461_1718439.md)</sup> also to
Bledsoe's Theodicy,<sup>[81](footnote/fn74.htm#P7462_1718488.md)</sup>
heretofore cited. I venture to say, that, among the thinkers of America,
and as Christian philosophers, both Bledsoe and Tappan are less known
and honoured than they deserve to be.

VI

Not esteemed authoritative by all, p. 379.

Not by Jerome, nor Rufinus, nor Chrysostom. Gregory the Great, Bishop of
Rome, is also shown by Lardner (*Credib*., v. 127) to have quoted "the
wisdom of Solomon" only as the sayings of a wise man; not at all as
Scripture. The Easterns are equally represented by John Damascene (a.d.
730), who says of this book that it is one of those "excellent and
useful" books which are not reckoned with the hagiographa. But Methodius
is an exception; for he quotes this book *twice* (says Lardner) as if it
were Scripture, and certainly cites it not infrequently. Yet his
testimony does not amount, perhaps, to more than an acceptance of the
same as only deutero-canonical; i.e., as one of the books read in the
Church for instruction, but not appealed to as establishing any doctrine
otherwise unknown to the Church. We may examine this subject when we
come to Methodius, in vol. vi. of this series.

Note.

This is a convenient place for the following tables, compiled from
Eusebius as far as his history goes; i.e.A.V. 305. See also Dr.
Robinson's *Researches*.

i\. The See OF Jerusalem.

ii\. The See OF Alexandria.

18\. Alexander,<sup>[82](footnote/fn75.htm#P7529_1720511.md)</sup> a.d.
326.
