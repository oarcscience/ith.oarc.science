<span id="iv.xxviii-p3"></span>“That which is born of the flesh is
flesh: and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.”

<span id="iv.xxviii-p4"></span> \[1.\] <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.xxviii-p4.1"></span>Great</span> mysteries are they, of which the
Only-begotten Son of God has counted us worthy; great, and such as we
were not worthy of, but such as it was meet for Him to give. For if one
reckon our desert, we were not only unworthy of the gift, but also
liable to punishment and vengeance; but He, because He looked not to
this, not only delivered us from punishment, but freely gave us a life
much more bright  <span id="fr_678"></span>[679](#fn_678.md) than the
first, introduced us into another world, made us another creature; “If
any man be in Christ,” saith Paul, “he is a new creature.” ( [2 Cor. v.
17](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#017.md) <span id="iv.xxviii-p5.1"></span>
.) What kind of “new creature”? Hear Christ Himself declare; “Except a
man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom
of God.” Paradise was entrusted to us, and we were shown unworthy to
dwell even there, yet He hath exalted us to heaven. In the first things
we were found unfaithful, and He hath committed to us greater; we could
not refrain from a single tree, and He hath provided for us the delights
 <span id="fr_679"></span>[680](#fn_679.md) above; we kept not our place in
Paradise, and He hath opened to us the doors of heaven. Well said Paul,
“O the depth of the riches, both of the wisdom and knowledge of God!” (
[Rom. xi. 33](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#033.md) <span
id="iv.xxviii-p6.2"></span> .) There is no longer a mother, or pangs, or
sleep, or coming together, and embracings of bodies; henceforth all the
fabric  <span id="fr_680"></span>[681](#fn_680.md) of our nature is framed
above, of the Holy Ghost and water. The water is employed, being made
the Birth to him who is born; what the womb is to the embryo, the water
is to the believer; for in the water he is fashioned and formed. At
first it was said, “Let the waters bring forth the creeping things that
have life” ( [Gen. i. 20](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#020.md) <span
id="iv.xxviii-p7.2"></span> , LXX.); but from the time that the Lord
entered the streams of Jordan, the water no longer gives forth the
“creeping thing that hath life,” but reasonable and Spirit-bearing
souls; and what has been said of the sun, that he is “as a bridegroom
coming out of his chamber” ( [Ps. xviii.
6](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#006) <span id="iv.xxviii-p7.3"></span> .md),
we may now rather say of the faithful, for they send forth rays far
brighter than he. That which is fashioned in the womb requires time, not
so that in water, but all is done in a single moment. Here our life is
perishable, and takes its origin from the decay of other bodies; that
which is to be born comes slowly, (for such is the nature of bodies,
they acquire perfection by time,) but it is not so with spiritual
things. And why? Because the things made are formed perfect from the
beginning.

<span id="iv.xxviii-p8"></span>When Nicodemus still hearing these things
was troubled, see how Christ partly opens to him the secret of this
mystery, and makes that clear which was for a while obscure to him.
“That which is born,” saith He, “of the flesh is flesh; and that which
is born of the Spirit is spirit.” He leads him away from all the things
of sense, and suffers him not vainly to pry into the mysteries revealed
with his fleshly eyes; “We speak not,” saith He, “of flesh, but of
Spirit, O Nicodemus,” (by this word He directs him heavenward for a
while,) “seek then nothing relating to things of sense; never can the
Spirit appear to those eyes, think not that the Spirit bringeth forth
the flesh.” “How then,” perhaps one may ask, “was the Flesh of the Lord
brought forth?” Not of the Spirit only, but of flesh; as Paul de <span
id="page_90">p. 90</span> <span id="iv.xxviii-Page_90"></span> clares,
when he says, “Made of a woman, made under the Law” ( [Gal. iv.
4](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#004) <span id="iv.xxviii-p8.1"></span> .md);
for the Spirit fashioned Him not indeed out of nothing, (for what need
was there then of a womb?) but from the flesh of a Virgin. How, I cannot
explain unto you; yet it was done, that no one might suppose that what
was born is alien to our nature. For if even when this has taken place
there are some who disbelieve in such a birth, into what impiety would
they not have fallen had He not partaken of the Virgin’s flesh.

<span id="iv.xxviii-p9"></span> “That which is born  <span
id="fr_681"></span>[682](#fn_681.md) of the Spirit is spirit.” Seest thou
the dignity of the Spirit? It appears performing the work of God; for
above he said of some, that, “they were begotten of God,” ( [John
1.13](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#013.md)<span id="iv.xxviii-p10.1"></span>
,) here He saith, that the Spirit begetteth them.

<span id="iv.xxviii-p11"></span> “That which is born of the Spirit is
spirit.” His meaning is of this kind; “He that is born  <span
id="fr_682"></span>[683](#fn_682.md) of the Spirit is spiritual.” For the
Birth which He speaks of here is not that according to essence,  <span
id="fr_683"></span>[684](#fn_683.md) but according to honor and grace. Now
if the Son is so born also, in what shall He be superior to men so born?
And how is He, Only-begotten? For I too am born of God, though not of
His Essence, and if He also is not of His Essence, how in this respect
does He differ from us? Nay, He will then be found to be inferior to the
Spirit; for birth of this kind is by the grace of the Spirit. Needs He
then the help of the Spirit that He may continue a Son? And in what do
these differ from Jewish doctrines?

<span id="iv.xxviii-p14"></span>Christ then having said, “He that is
born of the Spirit is spirit,” when He saw him again confused, leads His
discourse to an example from sense, saying,

<span id="iv.xxviii-p15"></span> [John
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#007.md),
[8](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#008.md)<span id="iv.xxviii-p15.1"></span> .
“Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.  <span
id="fr_684"></span>[685](#fn_684.md) The wind bloweth where it listeth.”

<span id="iv.xxviii-p17"></span>For by saying, “Marvel not,” He
indicates the confusion of his soul, and leads him to something lighter
than body. He had already led him away from fleshly things, by saying,
“That which is born of the Spirit is spirit”; but when Nicodemus knew
not what “that which is born of the Spirit is spirit” meant, He next
carries him to another figure, not bringing him to the density of
bodies, nor yet speaking of things purely incorporeal, (for had he heard
he could not have received this,) but having found a something between
what is and what is not body, namely, the motion of the wind, He brings
him to that next. And He saith of it,

<span id="iv.xxviii-p18"></span>“Thou hearest the sound thereof, but
canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth.”

<span id="iv.xxviii-p19"></span>Though He saith, “it bloweth where it
listeth,” He saith it not as if the wind had any power of choice, but
declaring that its natural motion cannot be hindered, and is with power.
For Scripture knoweth how to speak thus of things without life, as when
it saith, “The creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly.” (
[Rom. viii. 20](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#020.md) <span
id="iv.xxviii-p19.1"></span> .) The expression therefore, “bloweth where
it listeth,” is that of one who would show that it cannot be restrained,
that it is spread abroad everywhere, and that none can hinder its
passing hither and thither, but that it goes abroad with great might,
and none is able to turn aside its violence.

<span id="iv.xxviii-p20"></span> \[2.\] “And thou hearest its voice,”
 <span id="fr_685"></span>[686](#fn_685.md) (that is, its rustle, its
noise,) “but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth; so
is every one that is born of the Spirit.”

<span id="iv.xxviii-p22"></span> Here is the conclusion of the whole
matter. “If,” saith He, “thou knowest not how to explain the motion nor
the path of this wind  <span id="fr_686"></span>[687](#fn_686.md) which
thou perceivest by hearing and touch, why art thou over-anxious about
the working of the Divine Spirit, when thou understandest not that of
the wind, though thou hearest its voice?” The expression, “bloweth where
it listeth,” is also used to establish the power of the Comforter; for
if none can hold the wind, but it moveth where it listeth, much less
will the laws of nature, or limits of bodily generation, or anything of
the like kind, be able to restrain the operations of the Spirit.

<span id="iv.xxviii-p24"></span>That the expression, “thou hearest its
voice,” is used respecting the wind, is clear from this circumstance; He
would not, when conversing with an unbeliever and one unacquainted with
the operation of the Spirit, have said, “Thou hearest its voice.” As
then the wind is not visible, although it utters a sound, so neither is
the birth of that which is spiritual visible to our bodily eyes; yet the
wind is a body, although a very subtle one; for whatever is the object
of sense is body. If then you do not complain because you cannot see
this body, and do not on this account disbelieve, why do you, when you
hear of “the Spirit,” hesitate and demand such exact accounts, although
you act not so in the case of a body? What then doth Nicodemus? still he
continues in his low Jewish opinion, and that too when so clear an
example has been mentioned to him. Wherefore when he again says
doubtingly,

<span id="iv.xxviii-p25"></span> [John
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#009.md),
[10](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#010.md)<span id="iv.xxviii-p25.1"></span>
. “How can these things be?” Christ now speaks to him more chidingly;
“Art thou a master in Israel, and knowest not these things?”

<span id="iv.xxviii-p26"></span>Observe how He nowhere accuses the man
of wickedness, but only of weakness and simplicity. “And what,” one may
ask, “has this birth in common with Jewish matters?” Tell <span
id="page_91">p. 91</span> <span id="iv.xxviii-Page_91"></span> me rather
what has it that is not in common with them? For the first-created man,
and the woman formed from his side, and the barren women, and the things
accomplished by water, I mean what relates to the fountain on which
Elisha made the iron tool to swim, to the Red Sea which the Jews passed
over, to the pool which the Angel troubled, to Naaman the Syrian who was
cleansed in Jordan, all these proclaimed beforehand, as by a figure, the
Birth and the purification which were to be. And the words of the
Prophet allude to the manner of this Birth, as, “It shall be announced
unto the Lord a generation which cometh, and they shall announce His
righteousness unto a people that shall be born, whom the Lord hath made”
( [Ps. 22:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#030.md), [Ps.
30:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#031.md)<span
id="iv.xxviii-p26.1"></span> , LXX.); and, “Thy youth shall be renewed
as an eagle’s” ( [Ps. ciii. 5](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#005.md) <span
id="iv.xxviii-p26.2"></span> , LXX.); and, “Shine, O Jerusalem; behold,
Thy King cometh!” ( [Isa. 60:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#001.md), [Zech.
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#009.md)<span id="iv.xxviii-p26.3"></span>
); and, “Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven.” ( [Ps. xxxii.
1](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001.md) <span id="iv.xxviii-p26.4"></span> ,
LXX.) Isaac also was a type of this Birth. For tell me, Nicodemus, how
was he born? was it according to the law of nature? By no means; the
mode of his generation was midway between this of which we speak and the
natural; the natural, because he was begotten by cohabitation; the
other, because he was begotten not of blood,  <span
id="fr_687"></span>[688](#fn_687) (but by the will of God..md) I shall show
that these figures  <span id="fr_688"></span>[689](#fn_688.md) proclaimed
beforehand not only this birth, but also that from the Virgin. For,
because no one would easily have believed that a virgin could bear a
child, barren women first did so, then such as were not only barren, but
aged also. That a woman should be made from a rib was indeed far more
wonderful than that the barren should conceive; but because that was of
early and old time, another figure, new and fresh, was given, that of
the barren women; to prepare the way for belief in the Virgin’s travail.
To remind him then of these things, Jesus said, “Art thou a master in
Israel, and knowest not these things?”

<span id="iv.xxviii-p29"></span> [John
3.11](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#011.md)<span id="iv.xxviii-p29.1"></span>
. “We speak that We do know, and testify that We have seen, and none
receiveth  <span id="fr_689"></span>[690](#fn_689.md) Our witness.”

<span id="iv.xxviii-p31"></span>This He added, making His words credible
by another argument, and condescending in His speech to the other’s
infirmity.

<span id="iv.xxviii-p32"></span> \[3.\] And what is this that He saith,
“We speak that We do know, and testify that We have seen”? Because with
us the sight is the most trustworthy of the senses, and if we desire to
gain a person’s belief, we speak thus, that we saw it with our eyes, not
that we know it by hearsay; Christ therefore speaks to him rather after
the manner of men, gaining belief for His words by this means also. And
that this is so, and that He desires to establish nothing else, and
refers not to sensual vision, is clear from this; after saying, “That
which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the
Spirit is spirit,” He adds, “We speak that we do know, and testify that
we have seen.” Now this (of the Spirit) was not yet born  <span
id="fr_690"></span>[691](#fn_690.md) ; how then saith He, “what we have
seen”? Is it not plain that He speaks of a knowledge not otherwise than
exact?

<span id="iv.xxviii-p34"></span> “And none receiveth our witness.” The
expression “we know,” He uses then either concerning Himself and His
Father, or concerning Himself alone; and “no man receiveth,” is the
expression not of one displeased, but of one who declares a fact: for He
said not, “What can be more senseless than you who receive not what is
so exactly declared by us?” but displaying all gentleness, both by His
works and His words, He uttered nothing like this; mildly and kindly He
foretold what should come to pass, so guiding us too to all gentleness,
and teaching us when we converse with any and do not persuade them, not
to be annoyed or made savage; for it is impossible for one out of temper
to accomplish his purpose, he must make him to whom he speaks still more
incredulous. Wherefore we must abstain from anger, and make our words in
every way credible by avoiding not only wrath, but also loud speaking
 <span id="fr_691"></span>[692](#fn_691.md) for loud speaking is the fuel
of passion.

<span id="iv.xxviii-p36"></span> Let us then bind  <span
id="fr_692"></span>[693](#fn_692.md) the horse, that we may subdue the
rider; let us clip the wings of our wrath, so the evil shall no more
rise to a height. A keen passion is anger, keen, and skillful to steal
our souls; therefore we must on all sides guard against its entrance. It
were strange that we should be able to tame wild beasts, and yet should
neglect our own savage minds. Wrath is a fierce fire, it devours all
things; it harms the body, it destroys the soul, it makes a man deformed
 <span id="fr_693"></span>[694](#fn_693.md) and ugly to look upon; and if
it were possible for an angry person to be visible to himself at the
time of his anger, he would need no other admonition, for nothing is
more displeasing than an angry countenance. Anger is a kind of
drunkenness, or rather it is more grievous than drunkenness, and more
pitiable than (possession of) a dæmon. But if we be careful not to be
loud in speech,  <span id="fr_694"></span>[695](#fn_694.md) we shall find
this the best path to sobriety of conduct.  <span
id="fr_695"></span>[696](#fn_695.md) And therefore Paul would take away
clamor as well as anger, when he says, “Let all anger and clamor be put
away from you.” ( [Eph. iv. 31](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#031.md) <span
id="iv.xxviii-p40.2"></span> .) Let us then obey this teacher of all
wisdom, and when we are wroth with our servants, let us consider our own
trespasses, and be ashamed at their <span id="page_92">p. 92</span>
<span id="iv.xxviii-Page_92"></span> forbearance. For when thou art
insolent, and thy servant bears thy insults in silence, when thou actest
unseemly, he like a wise man, take this instead of any other warning.
Though he is thy servant, he is still a man, has an immortal soul, and
has been honored with the same gifts as thee by your common Lord. And if
he who is our equal in more important and more spiritual things, on
account of some poor and trifling human superiority so meekly bears our
injuries, what pardon can we deserve, what excuse can we make, who
cannot, or rather will not, be as wise through fear of God, as he is
through fear of us? Considering then all these things, and calling to
mind our own transgressions, and the common nature of man, let us be
careful at all times to speak gently, that being humble in heart we may
find rest for our souls, both that which now is, and that which is to
come; which may we all attain, by the grace and lovingkindness of our
Lord Jesus Christ, with whom to the Father and the Holy Ghost be glory,
for ever and ever. Amen.
