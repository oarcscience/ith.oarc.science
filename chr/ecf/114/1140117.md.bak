<span id="v.xxiii-p3"></span> *“Having therefore, brethren, boldness to
enter into the holiest by the blood of <span class="c11"><span
id="v.xxiii-p3.1"></span>Jesus</span> , by a new and living way which He
hath consecrated*  <span id="fr_3148"></span>[3149](#fn_3148.md) *for us,
through the Veil, that is to say, His flesh, and having an High Priest*
 <span id="fr_3149"></span>[3150](#fn_3149.md) *over the house of God, let
us draw near with a true heart, in full assurance of faith, having our
hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with
pure water. Let us hold fast the profession*  <span
id="fr_3150"></span>[3151](#fn_3150.md) *of our hope without wavering.”*

<span id="v.xxiii-p7"></span> \[1.\] “ <span class="c11"><span
id="v.xxiii-p7.1"></span>Having</span> therefore, brethren, boldness to
enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way
which He hath consecrated for us.” Having shown the difference of the
High Priest, and of the sacrifices, and of the tabernacle, and of the
Covenant, and of the promise, and that the difference is great, since
those are temporal, but these eternal, those “near to vanishing away,”
these permanent, those powerless, these perfect, those figures, these
reality, for (he says) “not according to the law of a carnal
commandment, but according to the power of an endless life.” ( [Heb.
7.16](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#016)<span id="v.xxiii-p7.2"></span> ..md)
And “Thou art a Priest for ever.” ( [Heb.
5.6](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#006)<span id="v.xxiii-p7.3"></span> ..md)
Behold the continuance of the Priest. And concerning the Covenant, That
(he says) is old (for “that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to
vanish away”— [Heb. 8.13](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#013.md)<span
id="v.xxiii-p7.4"></span> ), but this is new; and has remission of sins,
while that \[has\] nothing of the kind: for (he says) “the Law made
nothing perfect.” ( [Heb. 7.19](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#019.md)<span
id="v.xxiii-p7.5"></span> .) And again, “sacrifice and offering Thou
wouldest not.” ( [Heb. 10.5](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#005.md)<span
id="v.xxiii-p7.6"></span> .) That is made with hands, while this is “not
made with hands” ( [Heb. 9.11](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#011.md)<span
id="v.xxiii-p7.7"></span> ): that “has the blood of goats” ( [Heb.
9.12](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#012)<span id="v.xxiii-p7.8"></span> .md),
this of the <span class="c11"><span id="v.xxiii-p7.9"></span>Lord</span>
; that has the Priest “standing,” this “sitting.” Since therefore all
those are inferior and these greater, therefore he says, “Having
therefore, brethren, boldness.”

<span id="v.xxiii-p8"></span>\[2.\] “Boldness”: from whence? As sins (he
means) produce shame, so the having all things forgiven us, and being
made fellow-heirs, and enjoying so great Love, \[produces\] boldness.

<span id="v.xxiii-p9"></span>“For the entrance into the holiest.” What
does he mean here by “entrance”? Heaven, and the access to spiritual
things.

<span id="v.xxiii-p10"></span> “Which he hath inaugurated,”  <span
id="fr_3151"></span>[3152](#fn_3151.md) that is, which He prepared, and
which He began; for the beginning of using is thenceforth called the
inaugurating; which He prepared (he means) and by which He Himself
passed.

<span id="v.xxiii-p12"></span> “A new and living way.” Here He expresses
“the full assurance of hope.” “New,” he says. He is anxious to show that
we have all things greater; since now the gates of Heaven have been
opened, which was not done even for Abraham. “A new and living way,” he
says, for the first was a way of death, leading to Hades, but this of
life. And yet he did not say, “of life,” but called it “living,” (the
ordinances, that is,) that which abideth.  <span
id="fr_3152"></span>[3153](#fn_3152.md)

<span id="page_455">p. 455</span> <span id="v.xxiii-Page_455"></span>

<span id="v.xxiii-p14"></span> “Through the veil” (he says) “of His
flesh.” For this flesh first cut that way, by this He inaugurated it
\[the way\] by which He walked. And with good reason did he call \[the
flesh\] “a veil.”  <span id="fr_3153"></span>[3154](#fn_3153.md) For when
it was lifted up on high, then the things in heaven appeared.

<span id="v.xxiii-p16"></span>“Let us draw near” (he says) “with a true
heart.” To what should we “draw near”? To the holy things, the faith,
the spiritual service. “With a true heart, in full assurance of faith,”
since nothing is seen; neither the priest henceforward, nor the
sacrifice, nor the altar. And yet neither was that priest visible, but
stood within, and they all without, the whole people. But here not only
has this taken place, that the priest has entered into the holy of
holies, but that we also enter in. Therefore he says, “in full assurance
of faith.” For it is possible for the doubter to believe in one way, as
there are even now many who say, that of some there is a resurrection
and of others not. But this is not faith. “In full assurance of faith”
(he says); for we ought to believe as concerning things that we see,
nay, even much more; for “here” it is possible to be deceived in the
things that are seen, but there not:  “here” we trust to the senses, but
there to the Spirit.

<span id="v.xxiii-p17"></span>“Having our hearts sprinkled from an evil
conscience.” He shows that not faith only, but a virtuous life also is
required, and the consciousness to ourselves of nothing evil. Since the
holy of holies does not receive “with full assurance” those who are not
thus disposed. For they are holy, and the holy of holies; but here no
profane person enters. They were sprinkled as to the body, we as to the
conscience, so that we may even now be sprinkled over with virtue
itself. “And having our body washed with pure water.” Here he speaks of
the Washing, which no longer cleanses the bodies, but the soul.

<span id="v.xxiii-p18"></span> “For He is faithful that promised.” “That
promised” what? That we are to depart thither and enter into the
kingdom. Be then in nothing over-curious, nor demand reasonings. Our
\[religion\]  <span id="fr_3154"></span>[3155](#fn_3154.md) needs faith.

<span id="v.xxiii-p20"></span>\[3.\] ( [Heb.
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#024.md),
[25](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#025)<span id="v.xxiii-p20.1"></span> .md)
“And” (he says) “let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to
good works. Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the
manner of some is, but exhorting  <span
id="fr_3155"></span>[3156](#fn_3155.md) one another and so much the more as
ye see the day approaching.” And again in other places, “The Lord is at
hand; be careful for nothing.” ( [Phil.
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#005.md),
[6](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#006)<span id="v.xxiii-p21.3"></span> ..md)
“For now is our salvation nearer: Henceforth the time is short.” ( [Rom.
xiii. 11](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#011.md) <span
id="v.xxiii-p21.4"></span> .)

<span id="v.xxiii-p22"></span>What is, “not forsaking the assembling of
ourselves together”? ( [1 Cor. vii. 29](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#029.md)
<span id="v.xxiii-p22.1"></span> .) He knew that much strength arises
from being together and assembling together. “For where two or three”
(it is said) “are gathered together in My name, there am I in the midst
of them” ( [Matt. xviii. 20](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#020.md) <span
id="v.xxiii-p22.2"></span> ); and again, “That they may be One, as we”
also are ( [John xvii. 11](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#011.md) <span
id="v.xxiii-p22.3"></span> ); and, “They had all one heart and \[one\]
soul.” ( [Acts iv. 32](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#032.md) <span
id="v.xxiii-p22.4"></span> .) And not this only, but also because love
is increased by the gathering \[of ourselves\] together; and love being
increased, of necessity the things of God must follow also. “And earnest
prayer” (it is said) was “made by” the people. ( [Acts xii.
5](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#005) <span id="v.xxiii-p22.5"></span> ..md)
“As the manner of some is.” Here he not only exhorted, but also blamed
\[them\].

<span id="v.xxiii-p23"></span> “And let us consider one another,” he
says, “to provoke unto  <span id="fr_3156"></span>[3157](#fn_3156.md) love
and to good works.” He knew that this also arises from “gathering
together.” For as “iron sharpeneth iron” ( [Prov.
xvii.17](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#017.md) <span
id="v.xxiii-p24.6"></span> ), so also association increases love. For if
a stone rubbed against a stone sends forth fire, how much more soul
mingled with soul! But not unto emulation (he says) but “unto the
sharpening of love.” What is “unto the sharpening of love”? Unto the
loving and being loved more. “And of good works”; that so they might
acquire zeal. For if doing has greater force for instruction than
speaking, ye also have in your number many teachers, who effect this by
their deeds.

<span id="v.xxiii-p25"></span>What is “let us draw near with a true
heart”? That is, without hypocrisy; for “woe be to a fearful heart, and
faint hands” ( [Ecclesiasticus
2.12](../../../bib/apo/sir002.htm#012.md)<span id="v.xxiii-p25.1"></span>
): let there be (he means) no falsehood among us; let us not say one
thing and think another; for this is falsehood; neither let us be
fainthearted, for this is not \[a mark\] of a “true heart.”
Faintheartedness comes from not believing. But how shall this be? If we
fully assure ourselves through faith.

<span id="v.xxiii-p26"></span>“Having our hearts sprinkled”: why did he
not say “having been purified”? \[Because\] he wished to point out the
difference of the sprinklings: the one he says is of God, the other our
own. For the washing and sprinkling the conscience is of God; but “the
drawing near with” truth and “in full assurance of faith” is our own.
Then he also gives strength to their faith from the truth of Him that
promised.

<span id="v.xxiii-p27"></span>What is “and having our bodies washed with
pure water”? With water which makes pure; or which has no blood.

<span id="v.xxiii-p28"></span> Then he adds the perfect thing, love.
 “Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together,” which some (he
says) do, and divide the assemblies.  <span
id="fr_3157"></span>[3158](#fn_3157.md)   <span id="page_456">p. 456</span>
<span id="v.xxiii-Page_456"></span> For “a brother helped by a brother
is as a strong city.” ( [Prov. xviii.
19](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#019.md) <span id="v.xxiii-p29.7"></span> ,
LXX.)

<span id="v.xxiii-p30"></span>“But let us consider one another to
provoke unto love.” What is, “let us consider one another”? For instance
if any be virtuous, let us imitate him, let us look on him so as to love
and to be loved. For from Love good works proceed. For the assembling is
a great good: since it makes love more warm; and out of love all good
things arise. For nothing is good which is not done through love.

<span id="v.xxiii-p31"></span> \[4.\] This then let us “confirm”  <span
id="fr_3158"></span>[3159](#fn_3158.md) towards each other. “For love is
the fulfilling of the law.” ( [Rom. xiii.
10](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#010) <span id="v.xxiii-p32.5"></span> ..md)
We have no need of labors or of sweatings if we love one another. It is
a pathway leading of itself towards virtue. For as on the highway, if
any man find the beginning, he is guided by it, and has no need of one
to take him by the hand; so is it also in regard to Love: only lay hold
on the beginning, and at once thou art guided and directed by it.  “Love
worketh no ill to his neighbor” ( [Rom. xiii.
10](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#010) <span id="v.xxiii-p32.6"></span> .md);
“thinketh no evil.” ( [1 Cor. xiii. 5](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#005.md)
<span id="v.xxiii-p32.7"></span> .) Let each man consider with himself,
how he is disposed toward himself. He does not envy himself; he wishes
all good things for himself; he prefers himself before all; he is
willing to do all things for himself. If then we were so disposed
towards others also, all grievous things are brought to an end; there is
no enmity; there is no covetousness: for who would choose to overreach
himself? No man; but on the contrary we shall possess all things in
common, and shall not cease assembling ourselves together. And if we do
this, the remembrance of injuries would have no place: for who would
choose to remember injuries against himself? Who would choose to be
angry with himself? Do we not make allowances for ourselves most of all?
If we were thus disposed towards our neighbors also, there will never be
any remembrance of injuries.

<span id="v.xxiii-p33"></span>And how is it possible (you say) that one
should so love his neighbor as himself? If others had not done this, you
might well think it impossible: but if they have done it, it is plain
that from indolence it is not done by ourselves.

<span id="v.xxiii-p34"></span>And besides, Christ enjoins nothing
impossible, seeing that many have even gone beyond His commands. Who has
done this? Paul, Peter, all the company of the Saints. Nay, indeed if I
say that they loved their neighbors, I say no great matter: they so
loved their enemies as no man would love those who were likeminded with
himself. For who would choose for the sake of those likeminded, to go
away into Hell. when he was about to depart unto a kingdom? No man. But
Paul chose this for the sake of his enemies, for those who stoned him,
those who scourged him. What pardon then will there be for us, what
excuse, if we shall not show towards our friends even the very smallest
portion of that love which Paul showed towards his enemies?

<span id="v.xxiii-p35"></span>And before him too, the blessed Moses was
willing to be blotted out of God’s book for the sake of his enemies who
had stoned him. David also when he saw those who had stood up against
him slain, saith, “I, the shepherd, have sinned, but these, what have
they done?” (See [2 Sam. xxiv. 17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#017.md)
<span id="v.xxiii-p35.1"></span> .) And when he had Saul in his hands,
he would not slay him, but saved him; and this when he himself would be
in danger. But if these things were done under the Old \[Covenant\] what
excuse shall we have who live under the New, and do not attain even to
the same measure with them? For if, “unless our righteousness exceed
that of the Scribes and Pharisees, we shall not enter into the kingdom
of Heaven” ( [Matt. v. 20](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#020.md) <span
id="v.xxiii-p35.2"></span> ), how shall we enter in when we have even
less than they?

<span id="v.xxiii-p36"></span>\[5.\] “Love your enemies,” He says. (
[Matt. v. 44](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#044.md) <span
id="v.xxiii-p36.1"></span> .) Love thou therefore thy enemy: for thou
art doing good not to him, but to thyself. How? Thou art becoming like
God. He, if he be beloved of thee, hath no great gain, for he is beloved
by a fellow-slave; but thou, if thou love thy fellow-slave, hast gained
much, for thou art becoming like God. Seest thou that thou art doing a
kindness not to him but to thyself? For He appoints the prize not for
him, but for thee.

<span id="v.xxiii-p37"></span>What then if he be evil (you say)? So much
the greater is the reward. Even for his wickedness thou oughtest to feel
grateful to him: even should he be evil after receiving ten thousand
kindnesses. For if he were not exceedingly evil, thy reward would not
have been exceedingly increased; so that the reason \[thou assignest\]
for not loving him, the saying that he is evil, is the very reason for
loving him. Take away the contestant and thou takest away the
opportunity for the crowns. Seest thou not the athletes, how they
exercise when they have filled the bags with sand? But there is no need
for thee to practice this. Life is full of things that exercise thee,
and make thee strong. Seest thou not the trees too, the more they are
shaken by the winds, so much the more do they become stronger and
firmer? We then. if we be long-suffering, shall also become strong. For
it is said, “a man who is long-suffering abounds in wisdom, but he that
is of a little soul is strongly foolish.” ( [Prov. xiv.
29](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#029) <span id="v.xxiii-p37.1"></span> ..md)
Seest thou how great is his commendation of the one, seest thou how
great his censure of the other? “Strongly foolish,” i.e. very
\[foolish\]. <span id="page_457">p. 457</span> <span
id="v.xxiii-Page_457"></span> Let us not then be faint-hearted  <span
id="fr_3159"></span>[3160](#fn_3159.md) one towards another: for this does
not rise from enmity, but from having a small soul. As if the soul be
strong, it will endure all things easily, and nothing will be able to
sink it, but will lead it into tranquil havens. To which may we all
attain, by the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, with
whom to the Father together with the Holy Ghost, be glory, power, honor,
now and for ever and world without end. Amen.
