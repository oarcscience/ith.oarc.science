<span id="iv.xxx-p3"></span> *“For God sent not His Son*  <span

<span id="iv.xxx-p6"></span> \[1.\] <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.xxx-p6.1"></span>Many</span> of the more careless sort of
persons, using the lovingkindness of God to increase the magnitude of
their sins and the excess of their disregard, speak in this way, “There
is no hell, there is no future punishment, God forgives us all sins.” To
stop whose mouths a wise man says, “Say not, His mercy is great, He will
be pacified for the multitude of my sins; for mercy and wrath come from
Him, and His indignation resteth upon sinners” ( [Ecclesiasticus
5.6](../../../bib/apo/sir005.htm#006)<span id="iv.xxx-p6.2"></span> .md):
and again, “As His mercy is great, so is His correction also.” (
[Ecclesiasticus 16.12](../../../bib/apo/sir016.htm#012.md)<span
id="iv.xxx-p6.3"></span> .) “Where then,” saith one, “is His
lovingkindness, if we shall receive for our sins according to our
deserts?” That we shall indeed receive “according to our deserts,” hear
both the Prophet and Paul declare; one says, “Thou shalt render to every
man according to his work” ( [Ps. lxii.
12](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#012.md) <span id="iv.xxx-p6.4"></span> ,
LXX.); the other, “Who will render to every man according to his work.”
( [Rom. ii. 6](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#006.md) <span
id="iv.xxx-p6.5"></span> .)  And yet we may see that even so the
lovingkindness of God is great; in dividing our existence  <span
id="fr_714"></span>[715](#fn_714.md) into two periods,  <span
id="fr_715"></span>[716](#fn_715.md) the present life and that which is to
come, and making the first to be an appointment of trial, the second a
place of crowning, even in this He hath shown great lovingkindness.

<span id="iv.xxx-p9"></span> “How and in what way?” Because when we had
committed many and grievous sins, and had not ceased from youth to
extreme old age to defile our souls with ten thousand evil deeds, for
none of these sins did He demand from us a reckoning, but granted us
remission of them by the washing  <span
id="fr_716"></span>[717](#fn_716.md) of Regeneration, and freely gave us
Righteousness and Sanctification. “What then,” says one, “if a man who
from his earliest age has been deemed worthy of the mysteries, after
this commits ten thousand sins?” Such an one deserves a severer
punishment. For we do not pay the same penalties for the same sins, if
we do wrong after Initiation.  <span id="fr_717"></span>[718](#fn_717.md)
And this Paul declares, saying, “He that despised Moses’ law died
without mercy under two or three witnesses; of how much sorer
punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden
under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the Covenant an
unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?” ( [Heb.
10:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#028.md),
[29](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#029)<span id="iv.xxx-p11.2"></span> ..md)
Such an one then is worthy of severer punishment.  <span
id="fr_718"></span>[719](#fn_718.md) Yet even for him God hath opened doors
of repentance, and hath granted him many means for the washing away his
transgressions, if he will. Think then what proofs of lovingkindness
these are; by Grace to remit sins, and not to punish him who after grace
has sinned and deserves punishment, but to give him a season and
appointed space for his clearing.  <span
id="fr_719"></span>[720](#fn_719.md) For all these reasons Christ said to
Nicodemus, “God sent not His Son to condemn the world, but to save the
world.”

<span id="iv.xxx-p14"></span>For there are two Advents of Christ, that
which has been, and that which is to be; and the two are not for the
same purpose; the first came to pass not that He might search into our
actions, but that He might remit; the object of the second will be not
to remit, but to enquire. Therefore of the first He saith, “I came not
to condemn the world, but to save the world” ( [John
3.17](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#017)<span id="iv.xxx-p14.1"></span> .md);
but of the second, “When the <span id="page_96">p. 96</span> <span
id="iv.xxx-Page_96"></span> Son shall have come in the glory of His
Father,  <span id="fr_720"></span>[721](#fn_720.md) He shall set the sheep
on His right hand, and the goats on His left.” ( [Matt.
25:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#031.md),
[46](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#046)<span id="iv.xxx-p15.3"></span> ..md)
And they shall go, these into life; and these into eternal punishment.
Yet His former coming was for judgment, according to the rule of
justice. Why? Because before His coming there was a law of nature, and
the prophets, and moreover a written Law, and doctrine, and ten thousand
promises, and manifestations of signs, and chastisements, and
vengeances, and many other things which might have set men right, and it
followed that for all these things He would demand account; but, because
He is merciful, He for a while pardons instead of making enquiry. For
had He done so, all would at once have been hurried to perdition. For
“all,” it saith, “have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.” (
[Rom. iii. 23](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#023.md) <span
id="iv.xxx-p15.4"></span> .) Seest thou the unspeakable excess of His
lovingkindness?

<span id="iv.xxx-p16"></span> [John
3.18](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#018.md)<span id="iv.xxx-p16.1"></span> .
“He that believeth on the Son,  <span id="fr_721"></span>[722](#fn_721.md)
is not judged;  <span id="fr_722"></span>[723](#fn_722.md) but he that
believeth not, is judged already.”

<span id="iv.xxx-p19"></span>Yet if He “came not to judge the world,”
how is “he that believeth not judged already,” if the time of “judgment”
has not yet arrived? He either means this, that the very fact of
disbelieving without repentance is a punishment, (for to be without the
light, contains in itself a very severe punishment,) or he announces
beforehand what shall be. For as the murderer, though he be not as yet
condemned by the decision of the judge, is still condemned by the nature
of the thing, so is it with the unbeliever. Since Adam also died on the
day that he ate of the tree; for so ran the decree, “In the day that ye
eat of the tree, ye shall die” ( [Gen. ii.
17](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#017.md) <span id="iv.xxx-p19.1"></span> ,
LXX.); yet he lived. How then “died” he? By the decree; by the very
nature of the thing; for he who has rendered himself liable to
punishment, is under its penalty, and if for a while not actually so,
yet he is by the sentence.

<span id="iv.xxx-p20"></span> Lest any one on hearing, “I came not to
judge the world,” should imagine that he might sin unpunished, and
should so become more careless, Christ stops  <span
id="fr_723"></span>[724](#fn_723.md) such disregard by saying, “is judged
already”; and because the “judgment” was future and not yet at hand, He
brings near the dread of vengeance, and describes the punishment as
already come. And this is itself a mark of great lovingkindness, that He
not only gives His Son, but even delays the time of judgment, that they
who have sinned, and they who believe not, may have power to wash away
their transgressions.

<span id="iv.xxx-p22"></span>“He that believeth on the Son, is not
judged.” He that “believeth,” not he that is over-curious: he that
“believeth,” not the busybody. But what if his life be unclean, and his
deeds evil? It is of such as these especially that Paul declares, that
they are not true believers at all: “They profess that they know God,
but in works they deny Him.” ( [Tit. i.
16](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#016) <span id="iv.xxx-p22.1"></span> ..md)
But here Christ saith, that such an one is not “judged” in this one
particular; for his works indeed he shall suffer a severer punishment,
but having believed once, he is not chastised for unbelief.

<span id="iv.xxx-p23"></span>\[2.\] Seest thou how having commenced His
discourse with fearful things, He has concluded it again with the very
same? for at first He saith, “Except a man be born of water and of the
Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God”: and here again, “He
that believeth not on the Son, is judged already.” “Think not,” He
saith, “that the delay advantageth at all the guilty, except he repent,
for he that hath not believed, shall be in no better state than those
who are already condemned and under punishment.”

<span id="iv.xxx-p24"></span> [John
3.19](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#019.md)<span id="iv.xxx-p24.1"></span> .
“And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and
men loved darkness rather than light.”

<span id="iv.xxx-p25"></span>What He saith, is of this kind: “they are
punished, because they would not leave the darkness, and hasten to the
light.” And hence He goes on to deprive them of all excuse for the
future: “Had I come,” saith He, “to punish and to exact account of their
deeds, they might have been able to say, ‘this is why we started away
from thee,’ but now I am come to free them from darkness, and to bring
them to the light; who then could pity one who will not come from
darkness unto light? When they have no charge to bring against us, but
have received ten thousand benefits, they start away from us.” And this
charge He hath brought in another place, where He saith, “They hated Me
without a cause” ( [John xv. 25](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#025.md) <span
id="iv.xxx-p25.1"></span> ): and again, “If I had not come and spoken
unto them, they had not had sin.” ( [John xv.
22](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#022) <span id="iv.xxx-p25.2"></span> ..md)
For he who in the absence of light sitteth in darkness, may perchance
receive pardon; but one who after it is come abides by the darkness,
produces against himself a certain proof of a perverse and contentious
disposition. Next, because His assertion would seem incredible to most,
(for none would prefer “darkness to light,”) He adds the cause of such a
feeling in them. What is that?

<span id="iv.xxx-p26"></span> [John
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#019.md),
[20](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#020.md)<span id="iv.xxx-p26.1"></span> .
“Because,” He saith, “their deeds were evil. For every one that doeth
evil, hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds
should be reproved.”

<span id="iv.xxx-p27"></span> Yet he came not to judge or to enquire,
but to pardon and remit transgressions, and to grant salvation through
faith. How then fled they?  <span id="fr_724"></span>[725](#fn_724.md)  
<span id="page_97">p. 97</span> <span id="iv.xxx-Page_97"></span> Had He
come and sat in His Judgment seat, what He said might have seemed
reasonable; for he that is conscious to himself of evil deeds, is wont
to fly his judge. But, on the contrary, they who have transgressed even
run to one who is pardoning. If therefore He came to pardon, those would
naturally most hasten to Him who were conscious to themselves of many
transgressions; and indeed this was the case with many, for even
publicans and sinners sat at meat with Jesus. What then is this which He
saith? He saith this of those who choose always to remain in wickedness.
He indeed came, that He might forgive men’s former sins, and secure them
against those to come; but since there are some so relaxed,  <span
id="fr_725"></span>[726](#fn_725.md) so powerless for the toils of virtue,
that they desire to abide by wickedness till their latest breath, and
never cease from it, He speaks in this place reflecting  <span
id="fr_726"></span>[727](#fn_726.md) upon these. “For since,” He saith,
“the profession of Christianity requires besides right doctrine a sound
conversation also, they fear to come over to us, because they like not
to show forth a righteous life. Him that lives in heathenism none would
blame, because with gods such as he has, and with rites as foul and
ridiculous as his gods, he shows forth actions that suit his doctrines;
but those who belong to the True God, if they live a careless life, have
all men to call them to account, and to accuse them. So greatly do even
its enemies admire the truth.” Observe, then, how exactly He layeth down
what He saith. His expression is, not “He that hath done evil cometh not
to the light,” but “he that doeth it always, he that desireth always to
roll himself in the mire of sin, he will not subject himself to My laws,
but chooses to stay without, and to commit fornication without fear, and
to do all other forbidden things. For if he comes to Me, he becomes
manifest as a thief in the light, and therefore he avoids My dominion.”
For instance, even now one may hear many heathen say, “that they cannot
come to our faith, because they cannot leave off drunkenness and
fornication, and the like disorders.”

<span id="iv.xxx-p31"></span> “Well,” says some one, “but are there no
Christians that do evil, and heathens that live discreetly?”  <span
id="fr_727"></span>[728](#fn_727.md) That there are Christians who do evil,
I know; but whether there are heathens who live a righteous life, I do
not yet know assuredly. For do not speak to me of those who by nature
are good and orderly, (this is not virtue,) but tell me of the man who
can endure the exceeding violence of his passions and (yet) be
temperate.  <span id="fr_728"></span>[729](#fn_728.md) You cannot. For if
the promise of a Kingdom, and the threat of hell, and so much other
provision,  <span id="fr_729"></span>[730](#fn_729.md) can scarcely keep
men in virtue, they will hardly go after virtue who believe in none of
these things. Or, if any pretend to do so, they do it for show; and he
who doth so for show, will not, when he may escape observation, refrain
from indulging his evil desires. However, that we may not seem to any to
be contentious, let us grant that there are right livers among the
heathen; for neither doth this go against my argument, since I spoke of
that which occurs in general, not of what happens rarely.

<span id="iv.xxx-p35"></span> And observe how in another way He deprives
them of all excuse, when He saith that, “the light came into the world.”
“Did they seek it themselves,” He saith, “did they toil, did they labor
to find it? The light itself came to them, and not even so would they
hasten to it.” And if there be some Christians who live wickedly, I
would argue that He doth not say this of those who have been Christians
from the beginning, and who have inherited true religion from their
forefathers, (although even these for the most part have been shaken
from  <span id="fr_730"></span>[731](#fn_730.md) right doctrine by their
evil life,) yet still I think that He doth not now speak concerning
these, but concerning the heathen and the Jews who ought to have come
 <span id="fr_731"></span>[732](#fn_731.md) to the right faith. For He
showeth that no man living in error would choose to come to the truth
unless he before had planned  <span id="fr_732"></span>[733](#fn_732.md)
for himself a righteous life, and that none would remain in unbelief
unless he had previously chosen always to be wicked.

<span id="iv.xxx-p39"></span> Do not tell me that a man is temperate,
and does not rob; these things by themselves are not virtue. For what
advantageth it, if a man has these things, and yet is the slave of
vainglory, and remains in his error, from fear of the company of his
friends? This is not right living. The slave of a reputation  <span
id="fr_733"></span>[734](#fn_733.md) is no less a sinner than the
fornicator; nay, he worketh more and more grievous deeds than he. But
tell me of any one that is free from all passions and from all iniquity,
and who remains among the heathen. Thou canst not do so; for even those
among them who have boasted great things, and who have, as they say,
 <span id="fr_734"></span>[735](#fn_734.md) mastered avarice or gluttony,
have been, most of all men, the slaves of reputation,  <span
id="fr_735"></span>[736](#fn_735.md) and this is the cause of all evils.
Thus it is that the Jews also have continued Jews; for which cause
Christ rebuked them and said, “How can ye believe, which receive honor
from men?” ( [John 5.44](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#044.md)<span
id="iv.xxx-p42.3"></span> .)

<span id="iv.xxx-p43"></span>“And why, pray, did He not speak on these
matters with Nathanael, to whom He testified of the truth, nor extend
His discourse to any length?” Because even he came not with such zeal as
did Nicodemus. For Nicodemus made <span id="page_98">p. 98</span> <span
id="iv.xxx-Page_98"></span> this his work,  <span
id="fr_736"></span>[737](#fn_736.md) and the season which others used for
rest he made a season for hearing; but Nathanael came at the instance of
another. Yet not even him did Jesus entirely pass by, for to him He
saith, “Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God
ascending and descending upon the Son of Man.” ( [John
1.51](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#051)<span id="iv.xxx-p44.2"></span> ..md)
But to Nicodemus He spake not so, but conversed with him on the
Dispensation and on eternal life, addressing each differently and
suitably to the condition of his will. It was sufficient for Nathanael,
because he knew the writings of the prophets, and was not so timid
either, to hear only thus far; but because Nicodemus was as yet
possessed by fear, Christ did not indeed clearly reveal to him the
whole, but shook his mind so as to cast out fear by fear, declaring that
he who did not believe was being judged,  <span
id="fr_737"></span>[738](#fn_737.md) and that unbelief proceeded from an
evil conscience. For since he made great account of honor from men, more
than he did of the punishment; (“Many,” saith the Evangelist, “of the
rulers believed on Him, but because of the Jews they did not confess”—
[John 12.42](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#042.md)<span
id="iv.xxx-p45.2"></span> ;) on this point Christ toucheth him, saying,
“It cannot be that he who believeth not on Me disbelieveth for any other
cause save that he liveth an unclean life.” Farther on He saith, “I am
the Light” ( [John 8.12](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#012.md)<span
id="iv.xxx-p45.3"></span> ), but here, “the Light came into the world”;
for at the beginning He spoke somewhat darkly, but afterwards more
clearly. Yet even so the man was kept back by regard for the opinion of
the many, and therefore could not endure to speak boldly as he ought.

<span id="iv.xxx-p46"></span> Fly we then vainglory, for this is a
passion more tyrannical than any. Hence spring covetousness and love of
wealth, hence hatred and wars and strifes; for he that desires more than
he has, will never be able to stop, and he desires from no other cause,
but only from his love of vainglory. For tell me, why do so many
encircle themselves with multitudes of eunuchs, and herds of slaves, and
much show? Not because they need it, but that they may make those who
meet them witnesses of this unseasonable display. If then we cut this
off, we shall slay together with the head the other members also of
wickedness, and there will be nothing to hinder us from dwelling on
earth as though it were heaven. Nor doth this vice merely thrust its
captives into wickedness, but is even co-existent  <span
id="fr_738"></span>[739](#fn_738.md) with their virtues, and when it is
unable entirely to cast us out of these, it still causeth us much damage
in the very exercise of them, forcing us to undergo the toil, and
depriving us of the fruit. For he that with an eye to this, fasts, and
prays, and shows mercy, has his reward. What can be more pitiable than a
loss like this, that it should befall man to bewail  <span
id="fr_739"></span>[740](#fn_739.md) himself uselessly and in vain, and to
become an object of ridicule, and to lose the glory from above? Since he
that aims at both cannot obtain both. It is indeed possible to obtain
both, when we desire not both, but one only, that from heaven; but he
cannot obtain both, who longs for both. Wherefore if we wish to attain
to glory, let us flee from human glory, and desire that only which
cometh from God; so shall we obtain both the one and the other; which
may we all enjoy, through the grace and loving kindness of our Lord
Jesus Christ, by whom and with whom, to the Father and the Holy Ghost,
be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
