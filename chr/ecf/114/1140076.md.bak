<span id="iv.lxxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c15"><span
id="iv.lxxiii-p1.1"></span>Homily LXXI.</span>

<span id="iv.lxxiii-p2"></span> <span id="iv.lxxiii-p2.1"></span> <span
class="c1"><span id="iv.lxxiii-p2.2"></span>John xiii</span>

<span id="iv.lxxiii-p3"></span> *“And He took*  <span
id="fr_1997"></span>[1998](#fn_1997.md) *His garments, and having sat down
again, said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you?” And what
follows.*

<span id="iv.lxxiii-p5"></span> \[1.\] A <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.lxxiii-p5.1"></span>grievous</span> thing, beloved, a grievous
thing it is to come to the depths of wickedness; for then the soul
becomes hard to be restored. Wherefore we should use every exertion not
to be taken at all;  <span id="fr_1998"></span>[1999](#fn_1998.md) since it
is easier not to fall in,  <span id="fr_1999"></span>[2000](#fn_1999.md)
than having fallen to recover one’s self. Observe, for instance, when
Judas had thrown himself into sin, how great assistance he enjoyed, yet
not even so was he raised. Christ said to him, “One of you is a devil” (
[John 6.71](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#071.md)<span
id="iv.lxxiii-p7.3"></span> ); He said, “Not all believe” ( [John
6.65](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#065.md)<span id="iv.lxxiii-p7.4"></span>
); He said, “I speak not of all,” and, “I know whom I have chosen” (
[John 13.18](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#018.md)<span
id="iv.lxxiii-p7.5"></span> ); and not one of these sayings doth he
feel. Now when He had washed their feet, and taken His garments, and sat
down, He said, “Know ye what I have done unto you?” He no longer
addresseth Himself to Peter only, but to them all.

<span id="iv.lxxiii-p8"></span> [John
13.13](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#013.md)<span id="iv.lxxiii-p8.1"></span>
. “Ye call Me Lord  <span id="fr_2000"></span>[2001](#fn_2000.md) and
Master,  <span id="fr_2001"></span>[2002](#fn_2001.md) and ye say well, for
so I am.”

<span id="iv.lxxiii-p11"></span> “Ye call Me.” He taketh to Him their
judgment, and then that the words may not be thought to be words of
their kindness, He addeth, “for so I am.” By introducing a saying of
theirs,  <span id="fr_2002"></span>[2003](#fn_2002.md) He maketh it not
offensive, and by confirming it Himself when introduced from them,
unsuspected. “For so I am,” He saith. Seest thou how when He converseth
with the disciples, He speaketh revealing more what belongeth unto
Himself? As He saith, “Call no man master on earth,  <span
id="fr_2003"></span>[2004](#fn_2003.md) for One is your guide”  <span
id="fr_2004"></span>[2005](#fn_2004.md) ( [Matt.
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#008.md),
[9](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#009.md)<span id="iv.lxxiii-p14.2"></span>
), so also, “And call no man father upon earth.” But the “one” and “one”
 <span id="fr_2005"></span>[2006](#fn_2005.md) is spoken not of the Father
only, but of Himself also. For had He spoken excluding Himself, how
saith He, “That ye may become the children of the light”? And again, if
He called the Father only, “Master,” how saith He, “For so I am”; and
again, “For one is your Guide, even Christ”? ( [John
12.26](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#026.md)<span
id="iv.lxxiii-p15.2"></span> .)

<span id="iv.lxxiii-p16"></span> [John
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#014.md),
[15](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#015.md)<span id="iv.lxxiii-p16.1"></span>
. “If I then,” He saith, “your Lord  <span
id="fr_2006"></span>[2007](#fn_2006.md) and Master have washed your feet,
ye ought also to wash one another’s feet. For I have given you an
example, that ye should do as I have done to you.”

<span id="iv.lxxiii-p18"></span> And yet it is not the same thing, for
He is Lord and Master, but ye are fellow-servants one of another. What
meaneth then the “as”? “With the same zeal.” For on this account He
taketh instances from greater actions that we may, if so be, perform the
less. Thus schoolmasters write the letters for children very
beautifully, that they may come to imitate them though but in an
inferior manner. Where now are they who spit on their fellow-servants?
where now they who demand honors? Christ washed the feet of the traitor,
the sacrilegious, the thief, and that close to the time of the betrayal,
and incurable as he was, made him a partaker of His table; and art thou
highminded, and dost thou draw up thine eyebrows? “Let us then wash one
another’s feet,” saith some one, “then we must wash those of our
domestics.” And what great thing if we do wash even those of our
domestics? In our case  <span id="fr_2007"></span>[2008](#fn_2007.md)
“slave” and “free” is a difference of words; but there an actual
reality. For by nature He was Lord and we servants, yet even this  <span
id="fr_2008"></span>[2009](#fn_2008.md) He refused not at this time to do.
But now it is matter for contentment if we do not treat free men as
bondmen, as slaves bought with money. And what shall we say in that day,
 <span id="fr_2009"></span>[2010](#fn_2009.md) if after receiving proofs of
such forbearance, we ourselves do not imitate them at all, but take the
contrary part, being in diametrical opposition, lifted up, and not
discharging the debt? For God hath made us debtors one to another,
having first so done Himself, and hath made us debtors of a less amount.
For He was our Lord, but we do it, if we do it at all, to our
fellow-servants, a thing which He Himself implied by saying, “If I then
your Lord and Master—so also do ye.” It would indeed naturally have
followed to say, “How much more should ye servants,” but He left this to
the conscience of the hearers.

<span id="iv.lxxiii-p22"></span>\[2.\] But why hath He done this “now”?
They were for the future to enjoy, some greater, some less honor. In
order then that they may not exalt themselves one above the other, and
say as they did before, “Who is the greatest” ( [Matt. xviii.
1](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#001.md) <span id="iv.lxxiii-p22.1"></span>
), nor be angry one against the other, He taketh down  <span
id="fr_2010"></span>[2011](#fn_2010.md) the high thoughts of them all, by
saying, that “although thou mayest <span id="page_259">p. 259</span>
<span id="iv.lxxiii-Page_259"></span> be very great, thou oughtest to
have no high thoughts towards thy brother.” And He mentioned not the
greater action, that “if I have washed the feet of the traitor, what
great matter if ye one another’s?” but having exemplified this by deeds,
He then left it to the judgment of the spectators. Therefore He said,
“Whosoever shall do and teach, the same shall be called great” ( [Matt.
v. 19](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#019.md) <span
id="iv.lxxiii-p23.3"></span> ); for this is “to teach” a thing, actually
to do it. What pride should not this remove? what kind of folly and
insolence should it not annihilate!  <span
id="fr_2011"></span>[2012](#fn_2011.md) He who sitteth upon the Cherubim
washed the feet of the traitor, and dost thou, O man, thou that art
earth and ashes and cinders and dust, dost thou exalt thyself, and art
thou highminded? And how great a hell wouldest thou not deserve? If then
thou desirest a high state of mind, come, I will show thee the way to
it; for thou dost not even know what it is. The man then who gives heed
to the present things as being great, is of a mean soul; so that there
can neither be humility without greatness of soul, nor conceit except
from littleness of soul. For as little children are eager for trifles,
gaping upon balls and hoops and dice,  <span
id="fr_2012"></span>[2013](#fn_2012.md) but cannot even form an idea of
important matters; so in this case, one who is truly wise, will deem
present things as nothing, (so that he will neither choose to acquire
them himself, nor to receive them from others;) but he who is not of
such a character will be affected in a contrary way, intent upon cobwebs
and shadows and dreams of things less substantial than these.

<span id="iv.lxxiii-p26"></span> [John
13.16-18](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#016.md)<span
id="iv.lxxiii-p26.1"></span> . “Verily I say unto you, the servant is
not greater than his lord, neither he that is sent greater than he that
sent him. If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them. I speak
not of you all  <span id="fr_2013"></span>[2014](#fn_2013.md) —but that the
Scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with Me hath lifted up
his heel against Me.”

<span id="iv.lxxiii-p28"></span> What He said before, this He saith here
also, to shame them; “For if the servant is not greater than his master,
nor he that is sent greater than him that sent him, and these things
have been done by Me, much more ought they to be done by you.” Then,
lest any one should say, “Why now sayest Thou these things? Do we not
already know them?” He addeth this very thing, “I speak not to you as
not knowing, but that by your actions ye may show forth the things
spoken of.” For “to know,” belongeth to all; but “to do,” not to all. On
this account He said, “Blessed are ye if ye do them”; and on this
account I continually and ever say the same to you, although ye know it,
that I may set you on the work. Since even Jews “know,” but yet they are
not “blessed”; for they do not what they know.  <span
id="fr_2014"></span>[2015](#fn_2014.md)

<span id="iv.lxxiii-p30"></span>“I speak not,” He saith, “of you all.” O
what forbearance! Not yet doth He convict the traitor, but veileth the
matter, hence giving him room for repentance. He convicteth and yet doth
not convict him when He saith thus, “He that eateth bread with Me hath
lifted up his heel against Me.” It seems to me that the, “The servant is
not greater than his lord,” was uttered for this purpose also, that if
any persons should at any time suffer harm either from domestics or from
any of the meaner sort, they should not be offended; looking to the
instance of Judas, who having enjoyed ten thousand good things, repaid
his Benefactor with the contrary. On this account He added, “He that
eateth bread with Me,” and letting pass all the rest, He hath put that
which was most fitted to restrain and shame him; “he who was fed by Me,”
He saith, “and who shared My table.” And He spake the words, to instruct
them to benefit those who did evil to them, even though such persons
should continue incurable.

<span id="iv.lxxiii-p31"></span> But having said, “I speak not of you
all,” in order not to attach fear to more than one,  <span
id="fr_2015"></span>[2016](#fn_2015.md) He at last separateth the traitor,
speaking thus; “He that eateth bread with Me.” For the, “not of you
all,” doth not direct the words to any single one, therefore He added,
“He that eateth bread with Me”; showing to that wretched one that He was
not seized in ignorance, but even with full knowledge; a thing which of
itself was most of all fitted to restrain him. And He said not,
“betrayeth Me,” but, “hath lifted up his heel against Me,” desiring to
represent the deceit, the treachery, the secrecy of the plot.

<span id="iv.lxxiii-p33"></span>\[3.\] These things are written that we
bear not malice towards those who injure us; but rebuke them and weep
for them; for the fit subjects of weeping are not they who suffer, but
they who do the wrong. The grasping man, the false accuser, and whoso
worketh any other evil thing, do themselves the greatest injury, and us
the greatest good, if we do not avenge ourselves. Such a case as this:
some one has robbed thee; hast thou given thanks for the injury, and
glorified God? by that thanksgiving thou hast gained ten thousand
rewards, just as he hath gathered for himself fire unspeakable. But if
any one say, “How then, if I ‘could’ not defend myself against him who
wronged me, being weaker?” I would say this, that thou couldest have put
into action the being discontented, the being impatient, (for these
things are in our power,) the praying against him, who grieved you, the
uttering ten thousand curses against him, the speaking ill <span
id="page_260">p. 260</span> <span id="iv.lxxiii-Page_260"></span> of him
to every one. He therefore who hath not done these things shall even be
rewarded for not defending himself, since it is clear that even if he
had had the power, he would not have done it. The injured man uses any
weapon that comes to hand, when, being little of soul, he defends
himself against one who has injured him, by curses, by abuse, by
plotting. Do thou then not only not do these things, but even pray for
him; for if thou do them not, but wilt even pray for him, thou art
become like unto God. For, “pray,” it saith, “for them, that
despitefully use you—that ye may be like unto  <span
id="fr_2016"></span>[2017](#fn_2016.md) your Father which is in Heaven.” (
[Matt. 5:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#044.md),
[45](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#045.md)<span id="iv.lxxiii-p34.3"></span>
.) Seest thou how we are the greatest gainers from the insolence of
others? Nothing so delighteth God, as the not returning evil for evil?
But what say I? Not returning evil for evil? Surely we are enjoined to
return the opposite, benefits, prayers. Wherefore Christ also repaid him
who was about to betray Him with everything opposite. He washed his
feet, convicted him secretly, rebuked him sparingly, tended  <span
id="fr_2017"></span>[2018](#fn_2017.md) him, allowed him to share His table
and His kiss, and not even by these  <span
id="fr_2018"></span>[2019](#fn_2018.md) was he made better; nevertheless
(Christ) continued doing His own part.

<span id="iv.lxxiii-p37"></span> But come, let us teach thee even from
the example of servants, and (to make the lesson stronger) those in the
Old (Testament), that thou mayest know that we have no ground of defense
when we remember a wrong. Will you then that I tell you of Moses, or
shall we go yet farther back? For the more ancient the instances that
can be pointed out, the more are we surpassed. “Why so?” Because virtue
was then more difficult. Those men had no written precepts, no patterns
of living, but their nature fought, unarmed, by itself,  <span
id="fr_2019"></span>[2020](#fn_2019.md) and was forced to float in all
directions unballasted.  <span id="fr_2020"></span>[2021](#fn_2020.md)
Wherefore also when praising Noah, God called him not simply perfect,
but added, “in his generation” ( [Gen. vii.
1](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#001.md) <span id="iv.lxxiii-p39.3"></span>
); signifying, “at that time,” when there were many hindrances, since
many others shone after him, yet will he have nothing less than they;
for in his own time he was perfect. Who then before Moses was patient?
The blessed and noble Joseph, who having shone by his chastity, shone no
less by his long suffering.  He was sold when he had done no wrong, but
was waiting on others, and serving, and performing all the duties of
domestics. They brought against him an evil accusation, and he did not
defend himself, though he had his father on his side. Nay, he even went
to carry food to them in the desert, and when he found them not, he did
not despair or turn back, (yet he had an excuse for doing so had he
chosen,) but remained near the wild beasts and those savage men,
preserving the feeling of a true brother. Again, when he dwelt in the
prison house, and was asked the cause, he spake no evil of them, but
only, “I have done nothing,” and, “I was stolen out of the land of the
Hebrews”; and after this again, when he was made lord, he nourished
them, and delivered them from ten thousand dangers. If we be sober, the
wickedness of our neighbor is not strong enough to cast us out of our
own virtue. But those others were not like him; they both stripped him,
and endeavored to kill him, and reproach him with his dream, though they
had even received their meat from him, and planned to deprive him of
life and of liberty. And they ate, and cared not for their brother lying
naked in the pit. What could be worse than such brutality? Were they not
worse than any number of murderers? And after this, having drawn him up,
they gave him over to ten thousand deaths, selling him to barbarian and
savage men, who were on their journey to barbarians. Yet he, when he
became ruler, not only remitted them their punishment, but even
acquitted them, as far at least as relating to himself, of their sin,
calling what had been done a dispensation of God, not any wickedness of
theirs; and the things which he did against them he did not as
remembering evil, but in all these he dissembled, for his brother’s
 <span id="fr_2021"></span>[2022](#fn_2021.md) sake. After this, when he
saw them clinging to him, he straightway threw away the mask, and wept
aloud, and embraced them, as though he had received the greatest
benefits, he, who formerly was made away with by them, and he brought
them all down into Egypt, and repaid them with ten thousand benefits.
What excuse then shall we have, if after the Law, and after grace, and
after the addition of so much heavenly wisdom, we do not even strive to
rival him who lived before grace and before the Law? Who shall deliver
us from punishment? For there is nothing, there is nothing more grievous
than the remembrance of injuries. And this the man hath showed that owed
ten thousand talents; from whom payment was at one time not demanded, at
another time again demanded; not demanded, because of the lovingkindness
of God; but demanded, because of his own wickedness, and because of his
malice toward his fellow-servant. Knowing all which things, let us
forgive our neighbors their trespasses, and repay them by deeds of an
opposite kind, that we too may obtain mercy from God, through the grace
and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and
dominion for ever and ever. Amen.
