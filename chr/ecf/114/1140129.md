<span id="v.xxxv-p2"></span> <span id="v.xxxv-p2.1"></span> <span
class="c1"><span id="v.xxxv-p2.2"></span>[Hebrews xii.
14](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#014.md)<span

<span id="v.xxxv-p3"></span> *“Follow peace with all men, and holiness,*
 <span id="fr_3407"></span>[3408](#fn_3407.md) *without which no one shall
see the <span class="c11"><span id="v.xxxv-p4.3"></span>Lord</span> .”*

<span id="v.xxxv-p5"></span> \[1.\] <span class="c11"><span
id="v.xxxv-p5.1"></span>There</span> are many things characteristic of
Christianity: but more than all, and better than all, Love towards one
another, and Peace. Therefore Christ also saith, “My peace I give unto
you.” ( [John xiv. 27](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#027.md) <span
id="v.xxxv-p5.2"></span> .) And again, “By this shall all men know that
ye are My disciples, if ye love one another.” ( [John xiii.
35](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#035) <span id="v.xxxv-p5.3"></span> ..md)
Therefore Paul too says, “Follow peace with all men, and holiness,” that
is, purity,  <span id="fr_3408"></span>[3409](#fn_3408.md) “without which
no man shall see the <span class="c11"><span
id="v.xxxv-p6.3"></span>Lord</span> .”

<span id="v.xxxv-p7"></span>“Looking diligently lest any man fail of the
grace of God.” As if they were traveling together on some long journey,
in a large company, he says, Take heed that no man be left behind: I do
not seek this only, that ye should arrive yourselves, but also that ye
should look diligently after the others.

<span id="v.xxxv-p8"></span>“Lest any man” (he says) “fail of the grace
of God.” (He means the good things to come, the faith of the gospel, the
best course of life: for they all are of “the Grace of God.”) Do not
tell me, It is \[but\] one that perisheth. Even for one Christ died.
Hast thou no care for him “for whom Christ died”? ( [1 Cor. viii.
11](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#011) <span id="v.xxxv-p8.1"></span> ..md)

<span id="v.xxxv-p9"></span>“Looking diligently,” he saith, that is,
searching carefully, considering, thoroughly ascertaining, as is done in
the case of sick persons, and in all ways examining, thoroughly
ascertaining. “Lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you.” (
[Deut. xxix. 18](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#018.md) <span
id="v.xxxv-p9.1"></span> .) This is found in Deuteronomy; and he derived
it from the metaphor of plants. “Lest any root of bitterness,” he says;
which he said also in another place when he writes, “A little leaven
leaveneth the whole lump.” ( [1 Cor. v.
6](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#006) <span id="v.xxxv-p9.2"></span> ..md)
Not for his sake alone do I wish this, he means, but also on account of
the harm arising therefrom. That is to say, even if there be a root of
this kind, do not suffer any shoot to come up, but let it be cut off,
that it may not bear its proper fruits, that so it may not defile and
pollute the others also. For, he saith, “Lest any root of bitterness
springing up trouble you; and by it many be defiled.”

<span id="v.xxxv-p10"></span>And with good reason did he call sin
“bitter”: for truly nothing is more bitter than sin, and they know it,
who after they have committed it pine away under their conscience, who
endure much bitterness. For being exceedingly bitter, it perverts the
reasoning faculty itself. Such is the nature of what is bitter: it is
unprofitable.

<span id="v.xxxv-p11"></span>And well said he, “root of bitterness.” He
said not, “bitter,” but “of bitterness.” For it is possible that a
bitter root might bear sweet fruits; but it is not possible that a root
and fountain and foundation of bitterness, should ever bear sweet fruit;
for all is bitter, it has nothing sweet, all are bitter, all unpleasant,
all full of hatred and abomination.

<span id="v.xxxv-p12"></span>“And by this” (he says) “many be defiled.”
That is, Cut off the lascivious persons.

<span id="v.xxxv-p13"></span>\[2.\] [Heb.
12.16](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#016.md)<span id="v.xxxv-p13.1"></span> .
“Lest there be any fornicator: or profane person, as Esau, who for one
morsel of meat sold his birthright.”  <span
id="fr_3409"></span>[3410](#fn_3409.md)

<span id="v.xxxv-p15"></span>And wherein was Esau a “fornicator”? He
does not say that Esau was a fornicator. “Lest there be any fornicator,”
he says, then, “follow after holiness: lest there be any, as Esau,
profane”: that is, gluttonous, without self-control, worldly, selling
away things spiritual.

<span id="v.xxxv-p16"></span>“Who for one morsel of meat sold his
birthright,” who through his own slothfulness sold this honor which he
had from God, and for a little pleasure, lost the greatest honor and
glory. This was suitable to them. This \[was the conduct\] of an
abominable, of an unclean person. So that not only is the fornicator
unclean, but also the glutton, the slave of his belly. For he also is a
slave of a different pleasure. He is forced to be overreaching, he is
forced to be rapacious, to behave himself unseemly in ten thousand ways,
being the slave of that passion, and oftentimes he blasphemes. So he
accounted “his birthright” to be nothing worth. That is, providing for
temporary refreshment, he went even to the \[sacrifice of his\]
“birthright.” So henceforth “the birthright” belongs to us, not to the
Jews. And at the same time also this is added to their calamity, that
the first is become last, and the second, first: the one, for courageous
endurance; the other last for indolence.

<span id="v.xxxv-p17"></span>\[3.\] [Heb.
12.17](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#017.md)<span id="v.xxxv-p17.1"></span> .
“For ye know” (he says) “how that afterward, when he would have
inherited the blessing, he was rejected. For he found no place of
repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.” What now is this?
Doth he indeed exclude repentance? By no means. ‘But how, you say, was
it that “he found no <span id="page_507">p. 507</span> <span
id="v.xxxv-Page_507"></span> place of repentance”?’ For if he condemned
himself, if he made a great wailing, why did he “find no place of
repentance”? Because it was not really a case of repentance. For as the
grief of Cain was not of repentance, and the murder proved it; so also
in this case, his words were not those of repentance, and the murder
afterwards proved it. For even he also in intention slew Jacob. For “The
days of mourning for my father,” he said, “are at hand; then will I slay
my brother Jacob.” ( [Gen. xxvii. 41](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#041.md)
<span id="v.xxxv-p17.2"></span> .) “Tears” had not power to give him
“repentance.” And \[the Apostle\] did not say “by repentance” simply,
but even “with tears, he found no place of repentance.” Why now? Because
he did not repent as he ought, for this is repentance; he repented not
as it behoved him.

<span id="v.xxxv-p18"></span>For how is it that he \[the Apostle\] said
this? How did he exhort them again after they had become “sluggish” (
[Heb. 6.12](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#012.md)<span
id="v.xxxv-p18.1"></span> )? How, when they were become “lame”? How,
when they were “paralyzed”  <span id="fr_3410"></span>[3411](#fn_3410.md) (
[Heb. 12.13](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#013.md)<span
id="v.xxxv-p19.9"></span> )? How, when they were “relaxed”  <span
id="fr_3411"></span>[3412](#fn_3411.md) ( [Heb.
12.12](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#012.md)<span id="v.xxxv-p20.9"></span>
)? For this is the beginning of a fall. He seems to me to hint at some
fornicators amongst them, but not to wish at that time to correct them:
but feigns ignorance that they might correct themselves. For it is right
at first indeed to pretend ignorance: but afterwards, when they continue
\[in sin\], then to add reproof also, that so they may not become
shameless. Which Moses also did in the case of Zimri and the daughter of
Cosbi.

<span id="v.xxxv-p21"></span> “For he found” (he says) “no place of
repentance,” he found not repentance; or that he sinned beyond  <span
id="fr_3412"></span>[3413](#fn_3412.md) repentance. There are then sins
beyond repentance. His meaning is, Let us not fall by an incurable fall.
So long as it is a matter of lameness, it is easy to become upright: but
if we turn out of the way, what will be left? For it is to those who
have not yet fallen that he thus discourses, striking them with terror,
and says that it is not possible for him who is fallen to obtain
consolation; but to those who have fallen, that they may not fall into
despair, he says the contrary, speaking thus, “My little children, of
whom I travail in birth again, until Christ he formed in you.” ( [Gal.
iv. 19](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#019.md) <span id="v.xxxv-p22.4"></span>
.) And again, “Whosoever of you are justified by the Law, are fallen
from Grace.” ( [Gal. v. 4](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#004.md) <span
id="v.xxxv-p22.5"></span> .) Lo! he testifies that they had fallen away.
For he that standeth, hearing that it is not possible to obtain pardon
after having fallen, will be more zealous, and more cautious about his
standing: if however thou use the same violence towards one also who is
fallen, he will never rise again. For by what hope will he show forth
the change?

<span id="v.xxxv-p23"></span>But he not only wept (you say), but also
“sought earnestly.” He does not then exclude repentance; but makes them
careful not to fall.

<span id="v.xxxv-p24"></span>\[4.\] As many then as do not believe in
Hell, let them call these things to mind: as many as think to sin
without being punished, let them take account of these things. Why did
Esau not obtain pardon? Because he repented not as he ought. Wouldest
thou see perfect repentance? Hear of the repentance of Peter after his
denial. For the Evangelist in relating to us the things concerning him,
says, “And he went out and wept bitterly.” ( [Matt. xxvi.
75](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#075) <span id="v.xxxv-p24.1"></span> ..md)
Therefore even such a sin was forgiven him, because he repented as he
ought. Although the Victim had not yet been offered, nor had The
Sacrifice as yet been made, nor was sin as yet-taken away, it still had
the rule and sovereignty.

<span id="v.xxxv-p25"></span>And that thou mayest learn, that this
denial \[arose\] not so much from sloth, as from His being forsaken of
God, who was teaching him to know the measures of man and not to
contradict the sayings of the Master, nor to be more high-minded than
the rest, but to know that nothing can be done without God, and that
“Except the Lord build the house, they labor in vain who build it” (
[Ps. cxxvii. 1](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#001.md) <span
id="v.xxxv-p25.1"></span> ): therefore also Christ said to him alone,
“Satan desired to sift thee as wheat,” and I allowed it not, “that thy
faith may not fail.” ( [Luke 22:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#031.md),
[32](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#032)<span id="v.xxxv-p25.2"></span> ..md)
For since it was likely that he would be high-minded, being conscious to
himself that he loved Christ more than they all, therefore “he wept
bitterly”; and he did other things after his weeping, of the same
character. For what did he do? After this he exposed himself to dangers
innumerable, and by many means showed his manliness and courage.

<span id="v.xxxv-p26"></span>Judas also repented, but in an evil way:
for he hanged himself. Esau too repented; as I said; or rather, he did
not even repent; for his tears were not \[tears\] of repentance, but
rather of pride and wrath. And what followed proved this. The blessed
David repented, thus saying, “Every night will I wash my bed: I will
water my couch with my tears.” ( [Ps. vi.
6](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#006) <span id="v.xxxv-p26.1"></span> ..md)
And the sin which had been committed long ago, after so many years,
after so many generations he bewailed, as if it had recently occurred.

<span id="v.xxxv-p27"></span>\[5.\] For he who repents ought not to be
angry, nor to be fierce, but to be contrite, as one condemned, as not
having boldness, as one on whom sentence has been passed, as one who
ought to be saved by mercy alone, as one who has shown himself
ungrateful toward his Benefactor, as unthankful, as reprobate, as worthy
of punishments innumerable. If he considers these things, he will not be
angry, he will not be indignant, but will mourn, will weep, will groan,
and lament night and day.

<span id="v.xxxv-p28"></span>He that is penitent ought never to forget
his <span id="page_508">p. 508</span> <span id="v.xxxv-Page_508"></span>
sin, but on the one hand, to beseech God not to remember it; while on
the other, he himself never forgets it. If we remember it, God will
forget it. Let us exact punishment from ourselves; let us accuse
ourselves; thus shall we propitiate the Judge. For sin confessed becomes
less, but not confessed worse. For if sin add to itself shamelessness
and ingratitude, how will he who does not know that he sinned before be
at all able to guard himself from falling again into the same \[evils\]?

<span id="v.xxxv-p29"></span>Let us then not deny \[our sins\], I
beseech you, nor be shameless, that we may not unwillingly pay the
penalty. Cain heard God say, “Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I
know not; am I my brother’s keeper?” ( [Gen. iv.
9](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#009) <span id="v.xxxv-p29.1"></span> ..md)
Seest thou how this made his sin more grievous? But his father did not
act thus. What then? When he heard, “Adam, where art thou?” ( [Gen. iii.
9](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#009) <span id="v.xxxv-p29.2"></span> .md),
he said, “I heard Thy voice, and I was afraid, because I am naked, and I
hid myself.” ( [Gen. iii. 10](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#010.md) <span
id="v.xxxv-p29.3"></span> .) It is a great good to acknowledge our sins,
and to bear them in mind continually. Nothing so effectually cures a
fault, as a continual remembrance of it. Nothing makes a man so slow to
wickedness.

<span id="v.xxxv-p30"></span> \[6.\] I know that conscience starts back,
and endures not to be scourged by the remembrance of evil deeds; but
hold tight thy soul and place a muzzle on it. For like an ill-broken
 <span id="fr_3413"></span>[3414](#fn_3413.md) horse, so it bears
impatiently \[what is put upon it\], and is unwilling to persuade itself
that it has sinned: but all this is the work of Satan.  <span
id="fr_3414"></span>[3415](#fn_3414.md) But let us persuade it that it has
sinned; let us persuade it that it has sinned, that it may also repent,
in order that having repented it may escape torment. How dost thou think
to obtain pardon for thy sins, tell me, when thou hast not yet confessed
them? Assuredly he is worthy of compassion and kindness who has sinned.
But thou who hast not yet persuaded thyself \[that thou hast sinned\],
how dost thou think to be pitied, when thou art thus without shame for
some things?  <span id="fr_3415"></span>[3416](#fn_3415.md)

<span id="v.xxxv-p34"></span> Let us persuade ourselves that we have
sinned. Let us say it not with the tongue only, but also with the mind.
Let us not call ourselves sinners, but also count over our sins, going
over them each specifically.  <span id="fr_3416"></span>[3417](#fn_3416.md)
I do not say to thee, Make a parade of thyself, nor accuse thyself
before others: but be persuaded by the prophet when he saith, “Reveal
thy way unto the Lord.” ( [Ps. xxxvii.
5](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#005) <span id="v.xxxv-p35.3"></span> ..md)
Confess these things before God. Confess before the Judge thy sins with
prayer; if not with tongue, yet in memory, and be worthy of mercy.

<span id="v.xxxv-p36"></span> If thou keep thy sins continually in
remembrance, thou wilt never bear in mind the wrongs of thy neighbor. I
do not say, if thou art persuaded that thou art thyself a sinner; this
does not avail so to humble the soul, as sins themselves \[taken\] by
themselves, and examined specifically.  <span
id="fr_3417"></span>[3418](#fn_3417.md) Thou wilt have no remembrance of
wrongs \[done thee\], if thou hast these things continually in
remembrance; thou wilt feel no anger, thou wilt not revile, thou wilt
have no high thoughts, thou wilt not fall again into the same \[sins\],
thou wilt be more earnest towards good things.

<span id="v.xxxv-p38"></span>\[7.\] Seest thou how many excellent
\[effects\] are produced from the remembrance of our sins? Let us then
write them in our minds. I know that the soul does not endure a
recollection which is so bitter: but let us constrain and force it. It
is better that it should be gnawed with the remembrance now, than at
that time with vengeance.

<span id="v.xxxv-p39"></span>Now, if thou remember them, and continually
present them before God (see p. 448), and pray for them, thou wilt
speedily blot them out; but if thou forget them now, thou wilt then be
reminded of them even against thy will, when they are brought out
publicly before the whole world, displayed before all, both friends and
enemies, and Angels. For surely He did not say to David only, “What thou
didst secretly, I will make manifest to” ( [2 Sam. xii.
12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#012) <span id="v.xxxv-p39.1"></span> .md)
all, but even to us all. Thou wert afraid of men (he said) and respected
them more than God; and God seeing thee, thou caredst not, but wert
ashamed before men. For it says,  <span
id="fr_3418"></span>[3419](#fn_3418.md) “the eyes of men, this is their
fear.” Therefore thou shalt suffer punishment in that very point; for I
will reprove thee, setting thy sins before the eyes of all. For that
this is true, and that in that day the sins of us all are \[to be\]
publicly displayed, unless we now do them away by continual remembrance,
hear how cruelty and inhumanity are publicly exposed, “I was an
hungered” (He says) “and ye gave Me no meat.” ( [Matt. xxv.
42](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#042) <span id="v.xxxv-p40.2"></span> ..md)
When are these things said? Is it in a corner? Is it in a secret place?
 <span id="fr_3419"></span>[3420](#fn_3419.md) By no means. When then?
“When the Son of Man shall come in His glory” ( [Matt.
25:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#031.md),
[32](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#032)<span id="v.xxxv-p41.3"></span> .md),
and “all the nations” are gathered together, when He has separated the
one from the other, then will He speak in the audience of all, and will
“set” them “on His right hand” and “on” His “left” ( [Matt. xxv.
33](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#033) <span id="v.xxxv-p41.4"></span> .md):
“I was an hungered and ye gave Me no meat.”

<span id="v.xxxv-p42"></span>See again the five virgins also, hearing
before all, “I know you not.” ( [Matt. xxv.
12](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#012) <span id="v.xxxv-p42.1"></span> ..md)
For the five and five do not set forth the number of five only, but
those virgins who are wicked and cruel and inhuman, and those who are
not such. <span id="page_509">p. 509</span> <span
id="v.xxxv-Page_509"></span> So also he that buried his one talent,
heard before all, even of those who had brought the five and the two,
“Thou wicked and slothful servant.” ( [Matt. xxv.
26](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#026) <span id="v.xxxv-p42.2"></span> ..md) 
But not by words alone, but by deeds also does He then convict them:
even as the Evangelist also says, “They shall look on Him whom they
pierced.” ( [John xix. 37](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#037.md) <span
id="v.xxxv-p42.3"></span> .) For the resurrection shall be of all at the
same time, of sinners and of the righteous. At the same time shall He be
present to all in the judgment.

<span id="v.xxxv-p43"></span>\[8.\] Consider therefore who they are who
shall then be in dismay, who in grief, who dragged away to the fire,
while the others are crowned. “Come” (He says), “ye blessed of My
Father, inherit the kingdom which hath been prepared for you from the
foundation of the world.” ( [Matt. xxv.
34](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#034) <span id="v.xxxv-p43.1"></span> ..md)
And again, “Depart from Me into the fire which hath been prepared for
the devil and his angels.” ( [Matt. xxv.
41](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#041) <span id="v.xxxv-p43.2"></span> ..md)

<span id="v.xxxv-p44"></span>Let us not merely hear the words but write
them also before our sight, and let us imagine Him to be now present and
saying these things, and that we are led away to that fire. What heart
shall we have? What consolation? And what, when we are cut asunder? And
what when we are accused of rapacity? What excuse shall we have to
utter? What specious argument? None: but of necessity bound, bending
down, we must be dragged to the mouths of the furnace, to the river of
fire, to the darkness, to then ever-dying punishments, and entreat no
one. For it is not, it is not possible, He says, to pass across from
this side to that: for “there is a great gulf betwixt us and you” (
[Luke xvi. 26](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#026.md) <span
id="v.xxxv-p44.1"></span> ),and it is not possible even for those who
wish it to go across, and stretch out a helping hand: but we must needs
burn continually, no one aiding us, even should it be father or mother,
or any whosoever, yea though he have much boldness toward God. For, it
says, “A brother doth not redeem; shall man redeem?” ( [Ps. xlix.
8](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#008) <span id="v.xxxv-p44.2"></span> ..md)

<span id="v.xxxv-p45"></span>Since then it is not possible to have one’s
hopes of salvation in another, but \[it must be\] in one’s self after
the lovingkindness of God, let us do all things, I entreat you, so that
our conduct may be pure, and our course of life the best, and that it
may not receive any stain even from the beginning. But if not, at all
events, let us not sleep after the stain, but continue always washing
away the pollution by repentance, by tears, by prayers, by works of
mercy.

<span id="v.xxxv-p46"></span> What then, you say, if I cannot do works
of mercy?  <span id="fr_3420"></span>[3421](#fn_3420.md) But thou hast “a
cup of cold water” ( [Matt. x. 42](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#042.md)
<span id="v.xxxv-p47.3"></span> ), however poor thou art. But thou hast
“two mites” ( [Mark xii. 42](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#042.md) <span
id="v.xxxv-p47.4"></span> ), in whatever poverty thou art; but thou hast
feet, so as to visit the sick, so as to enter into a prison; but thou
hast a roof, so as to receive strangers. For there is no pardon, no,
none for him who does not do works of mercy.

<span id="v.xxxv-p48"></span>These things we say to you continually,
that we may effect if it be but a little by the continued repetition:
these things we say, not caring so much for those who receive the
benefits, as for yourselves. For ye give to them indeed things here, but
in return you receive heavenly things: which may we all obtain, in
Christ Jesus our Lord, with whom to the Father be glory, together with
the Holy Ghost, now and ever, and world without end. Amen.
