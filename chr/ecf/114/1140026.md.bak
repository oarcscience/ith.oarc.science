class="c1"><span id="iv.xxiii-p2.2"></span>[John
1:49](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#049.md),
[50](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#050.md)<span
id="iv.xxiii-p2.3"></span></span>

<span id="iv.xxiii-p3"></span>“Nathanael answered and saith unto Him,
Rabbi, Thou art the Son of God, Thou art the King of Israel. Jesus
answered, and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under
the fig-tree, believest thou? Thou shalt see greater things than these.”

<span id="iv.xxiii-p4"></span> \[1.\] <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.xxiii-p4.1"></span>Beloved</span> , we need much care, much
watchfulness, to be able to look into the depth of the Divine
Scriptures. For it is not possible to discover their meaning in a
careless way, or while we are asleep, but there needs close search, and
there needs earnest prayer, that we may be enabled to see some little
way into the secrets of the divine oracles. To-day, for instance, here
is no trifling question proposed to us, but one which requires much zeal
and enquiry. For when Nathanael said, “Thou art the Son of God,” Christ
replies, “Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig-tree,
believest thou? Thou shalt see greater things than these.”

<span id="iv.xxiii-p5"></span> Now what is the question arising from
this passage? It is this.  <span id="fr_539"></span>[540](#fn_539.md)
Peter, when after so many miracles and such high doctrine he confessed
that, “Thou art the Son of God” ( [Matt. xvi.
16](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#016) <span id="iv.xxiii-p6.3"></span> .md),
is called “blessed,” as having received the revelation from the Father;
while Nathanael, though he said the very same thing before seeing or
hearing either miracles or doctrine, had no such word addressed to him,
but as though he had not said so much as he ought to have said, is
brought  <span id="fr_540"></span>[541](#fn_540.md) to things greater
still. What can be the reason of this? It is, that Peter and Nathanael
both spoke the same words, but not both with the same intention. Peter
confessed Him to be “The Son of God” but as being Very God; Nathanael,
as being mere man. And whence does this appear? From what he said after
these words; for after, “Thou art the Son of God,” he adds, “Thou art
the King <span id="page_72">p. 72</span> <span
id="iv.xxiii-Page_72"></span> of Israel.” But the Son of God is not
“King of Israel” only, but of all the world.

<span id="iv.xxiii-p8"></span>And what I say is clear, not from this
only, but also from what follows. For Christ added nothing more to
Peter, but as though his faith were perfect, said, that upon this
confession of his He would build the Church; but in the other case He
did nothing like this, but the contrary. For as though some large, and
that the better, part were wanting to his confession He added what
follows. For what saith He?

<span id="iv.xxiii-p9"></span> [John
1.51](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#051.md)<span id="iv.xxiii-p9.1"></span> .
“Verily, verily I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and
the Angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man.”

<span id="iv.xxiii-p10"></span>Seest thou how He leads him up by little
and little from the earth, and causes him no longer to imagine Him a man
merely? for One to whom Angels minister, and on whom Angels ascend and
descend, how could He be man? For this reason He said, “Thou shalt see
greater things than these.” And in proof of this, He introduces the
ministry of Angels. And what He means is something of this kind: “Doth
this, O Nathanael, seem to thee a great matter, and hast thou for this
confessed me to be King of Israel? What then wilt thou say, when thou
seest the Angels ascending and descending upon Me?” Persuading him by
these words to own Him Lord also of the Angels. For on Him as on the
King’s own Son, the royal ministers ascended and descended, once at the
season of the Crucifixion, again at the time of the Resurrection and the
Ascension, and before this also, when they “came and ministered unto
Him” ( [Matt. iv. 11](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#011.md) <span
id="iv.xxiii-p10.1"></span> ), when they proclaimed the glad tidings of
His birth, and cried, “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace”
( [Luke ii. 14](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#014.md) <span
id="iv.xxiii-p10.2"></span> ), when they came to Mary, when they came to
Joseph.

<span id="iv.xxiii-p11"></span>And He does now what He has done in many
instances; He utters two predictions, gives present proof of the one,
and confirms that which has to be accomplished by that which is so
already. For of His sayings some had been proved, such as, “Before
Philip called thee, under the fig-tree I saw thee”; others had yet to
come to pass, and had partly done so, namely, the descending and
ascending of the Angels, at the Crucifixion, the Resurrection, and the
Ascension; and this He renders credible by His words even before the
event. For one who had known His power by what had gone before, and
heard from Him of things to come, would more readily receive this
prediction too.

<span id="iv.xxiii-p12"></span> What then does Nathanael? To this he
makes no reply. And therefore at this point Christ stopped His discourse
with him, allowing him to consider in private what had been said; and
not choosing to pour forth all at once, having cast seed into fertile
ground, He then leaves it to shoot at leisure. And this He has shown in
another place, where He saith, “The kingdom of heaven is like to a man
that soweth good seed, but while he slept, his enemy cometh, and soweth
tares among the wheat.”  <span id="fr_541"></span>[542](#fn_541.md)

<span id="iv.xxiii-p14"></span> [John
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#001.md),
[2](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#002.md)<span id="iv.xxiii-p14.1"></span> .
“On the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee. And Jesus was
called to the marriage. And the mother of Jesus was there, and His
brethren.”  <span id="fr_542"></span>[543](#fn_542.md)

<span id="iv.xxiii-p16"></span>I said before that He was best known in
Galilee; therefore they invite Him to the marriage, and He comes; for He
looked not to His own honor, but to our benefit. He who disdained not to
“take upon Him the form of a servant” ( [Philip. ii.
7](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007) <span id="iv.xxiii-p16.1"></span> .md),
would much less disdain to be present at the marriage of servants; He
who sat down “with publicans and sinners” ( [Matt. ix.
13](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#013.md) <span id="iv.xxiii-p16.2"></span>
), would much less refuse to sit down with those present at the
marriage. Assuredly they who invited Him had not formed a proper
judgment of Him, nor did they invite Him as some great one, but merely
as an ordinary acquaintance; and this the Evangelist has hinted at, when
he says, “The mother of Jesus was there, and His brethren.” Just as they
invited her and His brethren, they invited Jesus.

<span id="iv.xxiii-p17"></span> [John
2.3](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#003.md)<span id="iv.xxiii-p17.1"></span> .
“And when they wanted wine, His mother saith unto Him, They have no
wine.”

<span id="iv.xxiii-p18"></span>Here it is worth while to enquire whence
it came into His mother’s mind to imagine anything great of her Son; for
He had as yet done no miracle, since the Evangelist saith, “This
beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee.” ( [John
2.11](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#011.md)<span id="iv.xxiii-p18.1"></span>
.)

<span id="iv.xxiii-p19"></span>\[2.\] Now if any say that this is not a
sufficient proof that it was the “beginning of His miracles,” because
there is added simply “in Cana of Galilee,” as allowing it to have been
the first done there, but not altogether and absolutely the first, for
He probably might have done others elsewhere, we will make answer to him
of that which we have said before. And of what kind? The words of John
(the Baptist); “And I knew Him not; but that He should be made manifest
to Israel, therefore am I come, baptizing with water.” Now if He had
wrought miracles in early age, the Israelites would not have needed
another to declare Him. For He who came among men, and by His miracles
was so made known, not to those only in Judæa, but also to those in
Syria and beyond, and who did this in three years only, or rather who
did not need even these three years to manifest Himself ( [Matt. iv.
24](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#024.md) <span id="iv.xxiii-p19.1"></span>
), for immediately and from the first His fame went abroad everywhere;
He, I say, who in a short time so shone forth by the multitude of His
miracles, that His name was <span id="page_73">p. 73</span> <span
id="iv.xxiii-Page_73"></span> well known to all, was much less likely,
if while a child He had from an early age wrought miracles, to escape
notice so long. For what was done would have seemed stranger as done by
a boy, and there would have been time for twice or thrice as many, and
much more. But in fact He did nothing while He was a child, save only
that one thing to which Luke has testified ( [Luke ii.
46](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#046.md) <span id="iv.xxiii-p19.2"></span>
), that at the age of twelve years He sat hearing the doctors, and was
thought admirable for His questioning. Besides, it was in accordance
with likelihood and reason that He did not begin His signs at once from
an early age; for they would have deemed the thing a delusion. For if
when He was of full age many suspected this, much more, if while quite
young He had wrought miracles, would they have hurried Him sooner and
before the proper time to the Cross, in the venom of their malice; and
the very facts of the Dispensation would have been discredited.

<span id="iv.xxiii-p20"></span> “How then,” asks some one, “came it into
the mind of His mother to imagine anything great of Him?” He was now
beginning to reveal Himself, and was plainly discovered by the witness
of John, and by what He had said to His disciples. And before all this,
the Conception itself and all its attending circumstances  <span
id="fr_543"></span>[544](#fn_543.md) had inspired her with a very great
opinion of the Child; “for,” said Luke, “she heard all the sayings
concerning the Child, and kept them in her heart.”  <span
id="fr_544"></span>[545](#fn_544.md) “Why then,” says one, “did not she
speak this before?”  <span id="fr_545"></span>[546](#fn_545.md) Because, as
I said, it was now at last that He was beginning to manifest Himself.
Before this time He lived as one of the many, and therefore His mother
had not confidence to say any such thing to Him; but when she heard that
John had come on His account, and that he had borne such witness to Him
as he did, and that He had disciples, after that she took confidence,
and called Him, and said, when they wanted wine, “They have no wine.”
For she desired both to do them a favor, and through her Son to render
herself more conspicuous; perhaps too she had some human feelings, like
His brethren, when they said, “Show thyself to the world” ( [John
17.4](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#004.md)<span id="iv.xxiii-p23.1"></span>
), desiring to gain credit from His miracles. Therefore He answered
somewhat vehemently,  <span id="fr_546"></span>[547](#fn_546.md) saying,

<span id="iv.xxiii-p25"></span> [John
2.4](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#004.md)<span id="iv.xxiii-p25.1"></span> .
“Woman, what have I to do with thee? Mine hour is not yet come.”

<span id="iv.xxiii-p26"></span>To prove that He greatly respected His
mother, hear Luke relate how He was “subject to” His parents ( [Luke ii.
51](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#051.md) <span id="iv.xxiii-p26.1"></span>
), and our own Evangelist declare how He had forethought for her at the
very season of the Crucifixion. For where parents cause no impediment or
hindrance in things belonging to God, it is our bounden duty to give way
to them, and there is great danger in not doing so; but when they
require anything unseasonably, and cause hindrance in any spiritual
matter, it is unsafe to obey. And therefore He answered thus in this
place, and again elsewhere, “Who is My mother, and who are My brethren?”
( [Matt. xii. 48](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#048.md) <span
id="iv.xxiii-p26.2"></span> ), because they did not yet think rightly of
Him; and she, because she had borne Him, claimed, according to the
custom of other mothers, to direct Him in all things, when she ought to
have reverenced and worshiped Him. This then was the reason why He
answered as He did on that occasion. For consider what a thing it was,
that when all the people high and low were standing round Him, when the
multitude was intent on hearing  <span id="fr_547"></span>[548](#fn_547.md)
Him, and His doctrine had begun to be set forth, she should come into
the midst and take Him away from the work of exhortation, and converse
with Him apart, and not even endure to come within, but draw Him outside
merely to herself. This is why He said, “Who is My mother and My
brethren?” Not to insult her who had borne Him, (away with the thought!)
but to procure her the greatest benefit, and not to let her think meanly
of Him. For if He cared for others, and used every means to implant in
them a becoming opinion of Himself, much more would He do so in the case
of His mother. And since it was probable that if these words had been
addressed to her by her Son, she would not readily have chosen even then
to be convinced, but would in all cases have claimed the superiority as
being His mother, therefore He replied as He did to them who spake to
Him; otherwise He could not have led up her thoughts from His present
lowliness to His future exaltation, had she expected that she should
always be honored by Him as by a son, and not that He should come as her
Master.

<span id="iv.xxiii-p28"></span>\[3.\] It was then from this motive that
He said in this place, “Woman, what have I to do with thee?” and also
for another reason not less pressing. What was that? It was, that His
miracles might not be suspected. The request ought to have come from
those who needed, not from His mother. And why so? Because what is done
at the request of one’s friends, great though it be, often causes
offense to the spectators; but when they make the request who have the
need, the miracle is free from suspicion, the praise unmixed, the
benefit great. So if some excellent physician should enter a house where
there were many sick, and be spoken to by none of the patients or their
relations, but be <span id="page_74">p. 74</span> <span
id="iv.xxiii-Page_74"></span> directed only by his own mother, he would
be suspected  <span id="fr_548"></span>[549](#fn_548.md) and disliked by
the sufferers, nor would any of the patients or their attendants deem
him able to exhibit anything great or remarkable. And so this was a
reason why He rebuked her on that occasion, saying, “Woman, what have I
to do with thee?” instructing her for the future not to do the like;
because, though He was careful to honor His mother, yet He cared much
more for the salvation of her soul, and for the doing good to the many,
for which He took upon Him the flesh.

<span id="iv.xxiii-p30"></span> These then were the words, not of one
speaking rudely to his mother, but belonging to a wise dispensation,
which brought her into a right frame of mind, and provided that the
miracles should be attended with that honor which was meet. And setting
other things aside, this very appearance which these words have of
having been spoken chidingly, is amply enough to show that He held her
in high honor, for by His displeasure He showed that He reverenced her
greatly; in what manner, we will say in the next discourse. Think of
this then, and when you hear a certain woman saying, “Blessed is the
womb that bare Thee, and the paps which Thou hast sucked,” and Him
answering, “rather blessed are they that do the will of my Father”
 <span id="fr_549"></span>[550](#fn_549.md) ( [Luke xi.
27](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#027.md) <span id="iv.xxiii-p31.3"></span>
), suppose that those other words also were said with the same
intention. For the answer was not that of one rejecting his mother, but
of One who would show that her having borne Him would have nothing
availed her, had she not been very good and faithful. Now if, setting
aside the excellence of her soul, it profited Mary nothing that the
Christ was born of her, much less will it be able to avail us to have a
father or a brother, or a child of virtuous and noble disposition, if we
ourselves be far removed from his virtue. “A brother,” saith David,
“doth not redeem, shall man redeem?” ( [Ps. xlix.
7](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#007.md) <span id="iv.xxiii-p31.4"></span> ,
LXX.) We must place our hopes of salvation in nothing else, but only in
our own righteous deeds (done) after  <span
id="fr_550"></span>[551](#fn_550.md) the grace of God. For if this by
itself could have availed,  <span id="fr_551"></span>[552](#fn_551.md) it
would have availed the Jews, (for Christ was their kinsman according to
the flesh,) it would have availed the town in which He was born, it
would have availed His brethren. But as long as His brethren cared not
for themselves, the honor of their kindred availed them nothing, but
they were condemned with the rest of the world, and then only were
approved, when they shone by their own virtue; and the city fell, and
was burnt, having gained nothing from this; and His kinsmen according to
the flesh were slaughtered and perished very miserably, having gained
nothing towards being saved from their relationship to Him, because they
had not the defense of virtue. The Apostles, on the contrary, appeared
greater than any, because they followed the true and excellent way of
gaining relationship with Him, that by obedience. And from this we learn
that we have always need of faith, and a life shining and bright, since
this alone will have power to save us. For though His relations were for
a long time everywhere held in honor, being called the Lord’s kinsmen,
 <span id="fr_552"></span>[553](#fn_552.md) yet now we do not even know
their names, while the lives and names of the Apostles are everywhere
celebrated.

<span id="iv.xxiii-p35"></span> Let us then not be proud of nobleness of
birth  <span id="fr_553"></span>[554](#fn_553.md) according to the flesh,
but though we have ten thousand famous ancestors, let us use diligence
ourselves to go beyond their excellences, knowing that we shall gain
nothing from the diligence of others to help us in the judgment that is
to come; nay, this will be the more grievous condemnation, that though
born of righteous parents and having an example at home, we do not, even
thus, imitate our teachers. And this I say now, because I see many
heathens,  <span id="fr_554"></span>[555](#fn_554.md) when we lead them to
the faith and exhort them to become Christians, flying to their kinsmen
and ancestors and house, and saying, “All my relations and friends and
companions are faithful Christians.” What is that to thee, thou wretched
and miserable? This very thing will be especially thy ruin, that thou
didst not respect the number of those around thee, and run to the truth.
Others again who are believers but live a careless life, when exhorted
to virtue make the very same defense, and say, “my father and my
grandfather and my great-grandfather were very pious and good men.” But
this will assuredly most condemn thee, that being descended from such
men, thou hast acted unworthily of the root from whence thou art sprung.
For hear what the Prophet says to the Jews, “Israel served for a wife,
and for a wife he kept (sheep)” ( [Hos. xii.
12](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#012.md) <span id="iv.xxiii-p37.1"></span>
); and again Christ, “Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day, and he
saw it, and was glad.” ( [John
8.56](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#056.md)<span id="iv.xxiii-p37.2"></span>
.) And everywhere they bring forward  <span
id="fr_555"></span>[556](#fn_555.md) to them the righteous acts of their
fathers, not only to praise them, but also to make the charge against
their descendants more heavy. Knowing then this, let us use every means
that we may be saved by our own works, lest having deceived ourselves by
vain trusting on others, we learn that we have been deceived when the
knowledge of it will profit us nothing. “In the grave,” saith David,
“who shall give thee thanks?” ( [Ps. vi.
5](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#005.md) <span id="iv.xxiii-p38.1"></span>
.)  Let us then repent here, that we may obtain the everlasting goods,
which may God grant we all <span id="page_75">p. 75</span> <span
id="iv.xxiii-Page_75"></span> do, through the grace and lovingkindness
of our Lord Jesus Christ, with whom to the Father and the Holy Ghost be
glory, for ever and ever. Amen.
