<span id="v.xxxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c15"><span
id="v.xxxvii-p1.1"></span>Homily XXXIII.</span>

<span id="v.xxxvii-p2"></span> <span id="v.xxxvii-p2.1"></span> <span
class="c1"><span id="v.xxxvii-p2.2"></span>[Heb.
12:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#028.md),
[29](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#029.md)<span
id="v.xxxvii-p2.3"></span></span>

<span id="v.xxxvii-p3"></span> *“Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which
cannot be moved, let us have grace \[or gratitude,\]*  <span
id="fr_3448"></span>[3449](#fn_3448.md) *whereby we serve*  <span
id="fr_3449"></span>[3450](#fn_3449.md) *God acceptably with reverence and
godly fear. For our God is a consuming fire.”*

<span id="v.xxxvii-p6"></span> \[1.\] <span class="c11"><span
id="v.xxxvii-p6.1"></span>In</span> another place he says the same, “for
the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not
seen are eternal” ( <span id="v.xxxvii-p6.2"></span> 2. Cor. iv. 18 );
and from this makes an exhortation with regard to the evils which we
endure in this present life; and here he does this, and says, let us
continue steadfast; “let us have thankfulness,” i.e., let us give thanks
unto God. For not only we ought not to be discouraged at present things,
but even to show the greatest gratitude to Him, for those to come.

<span id="v.xxxvii-p7"></span>“Whereby we serve God acceptably,” that is
to say, ‘for thus is it possible to serve God acceptably,’ by giving him
thanks in all things. “Do all things” (he says) “without murmurings and
disputings.” ( [Phil. ii. 14](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#014.md) <span
id="v.xxxvii-p7.1"></span> .) For whatever work a man does with
murmuring, he cuts away and loses his reward; as the Israelites—how
great a penalty they paid for their murmurings. Wherefore he says,
“Neither murmur ye.” ( [1 Cor. x. 10](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#010.md)
<span id="v.xxxvii-p7.2"></span> .) It is not therefore possible to
“serve” Him “acceptably” without a sense of gratitude to Him for all
things, both for our trials, and the alleviations of them. That is, let
us utter nothing hasty, nothing disrespectful, but let us humble
ourselves that we may be reverential. For this is “with reverence and
godly fear.”

<span id="v.xxxvii-p8"></span> [Heb.
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#001.md),
[2](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#002.md)<span id="v.xxxvii-p8.1"></span> .
“Let brotherly love continue. Be not forgetful of hospitality,  <span
id="fr_3450"></span>[3451](#fn_3450.md) for hereby some have entertained
angels unawares.” See how he enjoins them to preserve what they had: he
does not add other things. He did not say, “Be loving as brethren,” but,
“Let brotherly love continue.” And again, he did not say, “Be
hospitable,” as if they were not, but, “Be not forgetful of
hospitality,” for this was likely to happen owing to their afflictions.

<span id="v.xxxvii-p10"></span> Therefore  <span
id="fr_3451"></span>[3452](#fn_3451) (he says.md) “some have entertained
angels unawares.” Seest thou how great was the honor, how great the
gain!

<span id="v.xxxvii-p12"></span> What is “unawares”?  <span
id="fr_3452"></span>[3453](#fn_3452.md) They entertained them without
knowing it. Therefore the reward also was great, because he entertained
them, not knowing that they were Angels. For if he had known it, it
would have been nothing wonderful. Some say that he here alludes to Lot
also.

<span id="v.xxxvii-p14"></span>\[2.\] [Heb.
13.3-5](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#003.md)<span
id="v.xxxvii-p14.1"></span> . “Remember them that are in bonds, as bound
with them, them which suffer adversity as being yourselves also in the
body. Marriage is honorable in all,  <span
id="fr_3453"></span>[3454](#fn_3453.md) and the bed undefiled; but
whoremongers and adulterers God will judge. Let your conversation be
without covetousness: being content with such things as ye have.”

<span id="v.xxxvii-p16"></span>See how large is his discourse concerning
chastity. “Follow peace,” he said, “and holiness; Lest there be any
fornicator or profane person” ( [Heb.
12.14](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#014.md)<span id="v.xxxvii-p16.1"></span>
); and again, “Fornicators and adulterers God will judge.” ( [Heb.
12.16](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#016.md)<span id="v.xxxvii-p16.2"></span>
.) In every case, the prohibition is with a penalty. “Follow peace with
all men,” he says, “and holiness, without which no man shall see the
Lord: But fornicators and adulterers God will judge.”

<span id="v.xxxvii-p17"></span>And having first set down “Marriage is
honorable in all men, and the bed undefiled,” he shows that he rightly
added what follows. For if marriage has been conceded, justly is the
fornicator punished, justly does the adulterer suffer vengeance.

<span id="v.xxxvii-p18"></span> Here he strips for  <span
id="fr_3454"></span>[3455](#fn_3454.md) the heretics. He did not say again,
Let no one be a fornicator; but having said it once for all, he then
went on as <span id="page_515">p. 515</span> <span
id="v.xxxvii-Page_515"></span> with a general exhortation, and not as
directing himself against them.

<span id="v.xxxvii-p20"></span> “Let your conversation be without
covetousness,” he says. He did not say, Possess nothing, but, “Let your
conversation be without covetousness”: that is, let it show forth the
philosophical character of your mind.  <span
id="fr_3455"></span>[3456](#fn_3455.md) \[And it will show it, if we do not
seek superfluities, if we keep only to what is necessary.\]  <span
id="fr_3456"></span>[3457](#fn_3456.md) For he says above also, “And ye
took joyfully the spoiling of your goods.” ( [Heb.
10.34](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#034.md)<span id="v.xxxvii-p22.2"></span>
.) He gives these exhortations, that they might not be covetous.

<span id="v.xxxvii-p23"></span>“Being content” (he says) “with such
things as ye have.” Then here also the consolation; ( [Heb.
13.5](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#005.md)<span id="v.xxxvii-p23.1"></span>
) “For He” (he says) “hath said, I will never leave thee nor forsake
thee”; ( [Heb. 13.6](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#006.md)<span
id="v.xxxvii-p23.2"></span> ) “so that we may boldly say, the Lord is my
helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.” Again
consolation in their trials.

<span id="v.xxxvii-p24"></span>\[3.\] [Heb.
13.7](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#007.md)<span id="v.xxxvii-p24.1"></span>
. “Remember them which have the rule over you.” This he was laboring to
say above: therefore “Follow peace with all men.” ( [Heb.
12.14](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#014.md)<span id="v.xxxvii-p24.2"></span>
.) He gave this exhortation also to the Thessalonians, to “hold them in
honor exceedingly.” ( [1 Thess. v. 13](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#013.md)
<span id="v.xxxvii-p24.3"></span> .)

<span id="v.xxxvii-p25"></span> “Remember” (he says) “them which have
the rule over you,  <span id="fr_3457"></span>[3458](#fn_3457.md) who have
spoken unto you the word of God, whose faith follow, considering the end
of their conversation.” What kind of following is this? Truly the best:
for he says, beholding their life, “follow their faith.” For from a pure
life \[cometh\] faith.

<span id="v.xxxvii-p27"></span> Or else by “faith,” he means
steadfastness. How so? Because they believe in the things to come. For
they would not have shown forth a pure life, if they had questioned
about the things to come, if they had doubted. So that here also he is
applying a remedy to the same \[evil\].  <span
id="fr_3458"></span>[3459](#fn_3458.md)

<span id="v.xxxvii-p29"></span> [Heb.
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#008.md),
[9](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#009.md)<span id="v.xxxvii-p29.1"></span> .
“ <span class="c11"><span id="v.xxxvii-p29.2"></span>Jesus Christ</span>
the same yesterday and to-day and for ever. Be not carried about with
divers and strange doctrines. For it is good that the heart be
established with grace, not with meats, which have not profited them
that have been occupied therein.”

<span id="v.xxxvii-p30"></span>In these words, “Jesus Christ the same
yesterday and to-day and for ever,” “yesterday” means all the time that
is past: “to-day,” the present: “for ever,” the endless which is to
come. That is to say: Ye have heard of an High Priest, but not an High
Priest who fails. He is always the same. As though there were some who
said, ‘He is not, another will come,’ he says this, that He who was
“yesterday and to-day,” is “the same also for ever.” For even now the
Jews say, that another will come; and having deprived themselves of Him
that is will fall into the hands of Antichrist.

<span id="v.xxxvii-p31"></span>“Be not carried about with divers and
strange doctrines.” Not “with strange doctrines” only, but neither with
“divers ones.”

<span id="v.xxxvii-p32"></span> “For it is a good thing that the heart
be established with grace, not with meats which have not profited them
that have been occupied  <span id="fr_3459"></span>[3460](#fn_3459.md)
therein.” Here he gently hints at those who introduce the observance of
“meats.” For by Faith all things are pure. There is need then of Faith,
not of “meats.”

<span id="v.xxxvii-p34"></span>For ( [Heb.
13.10](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#010.md)<span id="v.xxxvii-p34.1"></span>
) “we have an altar whereof they have no right to eat which serve  <span
id="fr_3460"></span>[3461](#fn_3460.md) the Tabernacle.” Not as the Jewish
\[ordinances\], are those among us, as it is not lawful even for the
High Priest to partake of them. So that since he had said, “Do not
observe,”  <span id="fr_3461"></span>[3462](#fn_3461.md) and this seemed to
be \[the language\] of one who is throwing down his own building, he
again turns it round. What, have not we then observances as well (he
says)? \[Yea we have\], and we observe them very earnestly too, not
sharing them even with the priests themselves.

<span id="v.xxxvii-p37"></span>\[4.\] [Heb.
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#011.md),
[12](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#012.md)<span id="v.xxxvii-p37.1"></span> .
“For the bodies of those beasts whose blood is brought into the
sanctuary by the High Priest for sin, are burned without the camp.
Wherefore Jesus also, that He might sanctify the people with His own
blood, suffered” (he says) “without the gate.” Seest thou the type
shining forth? “For sin,” he says, and “suffered without the gate.” (
[Heb. 13.13](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#013.md)<span
id="v.xxxvii-p37.2"></span> ) “Let us go forth therefore to Him without
the camp, bearing His reproach,” that is, suffering the same things;
having communion with Him in His sufferings. He was crucified without as
a condemned person: neither let us then be ashamed to “go forth out”
\[of the world\].

<span id="v.xxxvii-p38"></span> [Heb.
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#014.md),
[15](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#015.md)<span id="v.xxxvii-p38.1"></span> .
“For we have here no continuing city” (he says) “but we seek one to
come. By Him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God
continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to His Name.”

<span id="v.xxxvii-p39"></span> “By Him,” as by an High Priest,
according to the flesh.  <span id="fr_3462"></span>[3463](#fn_3462.md)
“Giving thanks”  <span id="fr_3463"></span>[3464](#fn_3463) (he says.md)
“to His Name.” (See p. 514.) Let us utter nothing blasphemous, nothing
hasty, nothing bold, nothing presumptuous, nothing desperate. This is
“with reverence and godly fear.” ( [Heb.
12.28](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#028.md)<span id="v.xxxvii-p41.4"></span>
.) For a soul in tribulations becomes desponding, and reckless.  <span
id="fr_3464"></span>[3465](#fn_3464.md) But let not us \[be so\]. See here
he again says the same thing which he said before, “not forsaking the
assembling of ourselves together,” for so shall we be able to do all
things <span id="page_516">p. 516</span> <span
id="v.xxxvii-Page_516"></span> with reverence. For oftentimes even out
of respect for men, we refrain from doing many evil things.

<span id="v.xxxvii-p43"></span> [Heb.
13.16](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#016.md)<span id="v.xxxvii-p43.1"></span>
. “But to do good and to communicate forget not.” I speak not \[merely\]
with reference to the brethren present, but to those absent also. But if
others have plundered your property, display your hospitality out of
such things as ye have. What excuse then shall we have henceforward,
when they, even after the spoiling of their goods, were thus admonished?

<span id="v.xxxvii-p44"></span> \[5.\] And he did not say, “Be not
forgetful” of the entertaining of strangers,  <span
id="fr_3465"></span>[3466](#fn_3465.md) but “of hospitality”:  <span
id="fr_3466"></span>[3467](#fn_3466.md) that is, do not merely entertain
strangers, but \[do it\] with love for the strangers. Moreover he did
not speak of the recompense that is future, and in store for us, lest he
should make them more supine, but of that already given. For “thereby
some” (he says) “have entertained angels unawares.”

<span id="v.xxxvii-p47"></span> But let us see in what sense “Marriage
is honorable in all and the bed undefiled.” Because (he means) it
preserves the believer in chastity. Here he also alludes to the Jews,
because they accounted the woman after childbirth  <span
id="fr_3467"></span>[3468](#fn_3467.md) polluted: and “whosoever comes from
the bed,” it is said, “is not clean.”  <span
id="fr_3468"></span>[3469](#fn_3468.md) Those things are not polluted
 <span id="fr_3469"></span>[3470](#fn_3469.md) which arise from nature, O
ungrateful and senseless Jew,  <span
id="fr_3470"></span>[3471](#fn_3470.md) but those which arise from choice.
 <span id="fr_3471"></span>[3472](#fn_3471.md) For if “marriage is
honorable” and pure, why forsooth dost thou think that one is even
polluted by it?

<span id="v.xxxvii-p53"></span> “Let your conversation” (he says) “be
without covetousness”: since many after having exhausted  <span
id="fr_3472"></span>[3473](#fn_3472.md) their property, afterwards wish to
recover it again under the guise of alms, therefore he says, “Let your
conversation be without covetousness”; that is, that we should be
\[desirous only\] of what is necessary  <span
id="fr_3473"></span>[3474](#fn_3473.md) and indispensable. What then (you
say) if we should not have a supply even of these? This is not possible;
indeed it is not. “For He hath said,” and He doth not lie, “I will never
leave thee, nor forsake thee. So that we boldly say, The Lord is my
Helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.” Thou hast the
promise from Himself: do not doubt henceforward. He has promised; make
no question. But this, “I will never leave thee,” he says not concerning
money only, but concerning all other things also. “The Lord is my
Helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me”; with good
reason.

<span id="v.xxxvii-p56"></span>This then also let us say in all
temptations; let us laugh at human things, so long as we have God
favorable to us. For as, when He is our enemy, it is no gain, though all
men should be our friends, so when He is our friend, though all men
together war against us, there is no harm. “I will not fear what man
shall do unto me.”

<span id="v.xxxvii-p57"></span> \[6.\] “Remember them which have the
rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God.” In this place
I think that he is speaking about assistance also.  <span
id="fr_3474"></span>[3475](#fn_3474.md) For this is \[implied in the
words\] “who have spoken unto you the word of God.”

<span id="v.xxxvii-p59"></span> “Whose faith follow considering the end
of their conversation.” What is, “considering”?  <span
id="fr_3475"></span>[3476](#fn_3475.md) Continually revolving, examining it
by yourselves, reasoning, investigating accurately, testing it as you
choose. “The end of their conversation,” that is, their conversation to
the end: for “their conversation” had a good end.

<span id="v.xxxvii-p61"></span> “Jesus Christ the same yesterday and
to-day and for ever.” Do not think that then indeed He wrought wonders,
but now works no wonders. He is the same. This is, “remember them that
have the rule over you.”  <span id="fr_3476"></span>[3477](#fn_3476.md)

<span id="v.xxxvii-p63"></span> “Be not carried about with divers and
strange doctrines.” “Strange,” that is, different from those ye heard
from us; \[“Divers”\] that is, of all sorts: for they have no stability,
but are different \[one from another\]. For especially manifold  <span
id="fr_3477"></span>[3478](#fn_3477.md) is the doctrine of meats.

<span id="v.xxxvii-p65"></span> “For it is a good thing that the heart
be established with grace; not with meats.” These are the “divers,”
these the “strange”  <span id="fr_3478"></span>[3479](#fn_3478.md)
\[doctrines\]: especially as Christ has said, “not that which entereth
into the mouth defileth the man, but that which cometh out.” ( [Matt.
xv. 11](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#011.md) <span
id="v.xxxvii-p66.2"></span> .) And observe that he does not make bold to
say this openly, but as it were by a hint.  <span
id="fr_3479"></span>[3480](#fn_3479.md) “For it is a good thing that the
heart be established with grace, not with meats.”

<span id="v.xxxvii-p68"></span>Faith is all. If that establishes \[it\],
the heart stands in security. It follows that Faith establishes:
consequently reasonings shake. For Faith is contrary to reasoning.

<span id="v.xxxvii-p69"></span> “Which” (he says) “have not profited
them that have been occupied therein.” For what is the gain from the
observance  <span id="fr_3480"></span>[3481](#fn_3480.md) \[of them\], tell
me. Does it not rather destroy? Does it not make such an one to be under
sin? If it be <span id="page_517">p. 517</span> <span
id="v.xxxvii-Page_517"></span> necessary to observe \[them\], we must
guard ourselves.  <span id="fr_3481"></span>[3482](#fn_3481.md)

<span id="v.xxxvii-p72"></span>“Which” (he says) “have not profited them
that have been occupied therein.” That is, who have always diligently
kept them.

<span id="v.xxxvii-p73"></span>There is one observance, abstaining from
sin. For what profit is it, when some are so polluted, as not to be able
to partake of the sacrifices? So that it did not save them at all;
although they were zealous about the observances. But because they had
not faith, even thus they profited nothing.

<span id="v.xxxvii-p74"></span> \[7.\] In the next place he takes away
 <span id="fr_3482"></span>[3483](#fn_3482.md) the sacrifice from the type,
and directs his discourse to the prototype, saying, “The bodies of those
beasts whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the High Priest, are
burned without the camp.” Then those things were a type of these and
thus Christ, suffering “without,” fulfilled all.

<span id="v.xxxvii-p76"></span> Here he makes it plain too that He
suffered voluntarily, showing  <span
id="fr_3483"></span>[3484](#fn_3483.md) that those things were not
accidental, but even the \[Divine\] arrangement itself was of a
suffering “without.” \[He suffered\] without, but His Blood was borne up
into Heaven. Thou seest then that we partake of Blood which has been
carried into the Holy Place, the True Holy Place; of the Sacrifice of
which the Priest alone had the privilege. We therefore partake of the
Truth \[the Reality\]. If then we partake not of “reproach” \[only\] but
of sanctification,  <span id="fr_3484"></span>[3485](#fn_3484.md) the
“reproach” is the cause of the sanctification. For as He was reproached,
so also are we. If we go forth “without” therefore, we have fellowship
with Him.

<span id="v.xxxvii-p79"></span>But what is, “Let us go forth to Him”?
Let us have fellowship with Him in His sufferings; let us bear His
reproach. For He did not simply bid us dwell “outside the gate,” but as
He was reproached as a condemned person, so also we.

<span id="v.xxxvii-p80"></span>And “by Him let us offer a sacrifice to
God.” Of what kind of sacrifice does he speak? “The fruit of lips giving
thanks to His Name.” They \[the Jews\] brought sheep, and calves, and
gave them to the Priest: let “us” bring none of these things, but
thanksgiving. This “fruit” let “our lips” put forth.

<span id="v.xxxvii-p81"></span>“For with such sacrifices God is well
pleased.” Let us give such a sacrifice to Him, that He may offer \[it\]
to The Father. For in no other way it is offered except through the Son,
or rather also through a contrite mind. All these things \[are said\]
for the weak. For that the thanks belong to the Son is evident: since
otherwise, how is the honor equal? “That all men” (He says) “should
honor the Son even as they honor the Father.” ( [John v.
23](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#023.md) <span id="v.xxxvii-p81.1"></span>
.) Wherein is the honor equal? “The fruit of our lips giving thanks to
His Name.”  <span id="fr_3485"></span>[3486](#fn_3485.md)

<span id="v.xxxvii-p83"></span>\[8.\] Let us bear all things thankfully,
be it poverty, be it disease, be it anything else whatever: for He alone
knows the things expedient for us. “For we know not what we should pray
for as we ought.” ( [Rom. viii. 26](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#026.md)
<span id="v.xxxvii-p83.1"></span> .) We then who do not know even how to
ask for what is fitting, unless we have received of  <span
id="fr_3486"></span>[3487](#fn_3486.md) the Spirit, let us take care to
offer up thanksgiving for all things, and let us bear all things nobly.
Are we in poverty? Let us give thanks. Are we in sickness? Let us give
thanks. Are we falsely accused? Let us give thanks: when we suffer
affliction, let us give thanks.

<span id="v.xxxvii-p85"></span> This brings us near to God: then we even
have God for our debtor. But when we are in prosperity, it is we who are
debtors and liable to be called to account. For when we are in
prosperity, we are debtors to God: and oftentimes these things bring a
judgment upon us, while those are for a payment of sins.  <span
id="fr_3487"></span>[3488](#fn_3487.md) Those \[afflictions\] draw down
mercy, they draw down kindness:  while these on the other hand lift up
even to an insane pride, and lead also to slothfulness, and dispose a
man to fancy great things concerning himself; they puff up. Therefore
the prophet also said, “It is good for me, Lord, that Thou hast
afflicted  <span id="fr_3488"></span>[3489](#fn_3488.md) me; that I may
learn Thy statutes.” ( [Ps. cxix. 71](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#071.md)
<span id="v.xxxvii-p87.3"></span> .) When Hezekiah had received
blessings and been freed from calamities, his heart was lifted up on
high; when he fell sick, then was he humbled, then he became near to
God. “When He slew them,” it says, “then they sought Him diligently, and
turned, and were early in coming to  <span
id="fr_3489"></span>[3490](#fn_3489.md) God.” ( [Ps. lxxviii.
34](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#034.md) <span id="v.xxxvii-p88.3"></span>
.) And again, “When the beloved waxed gross and fat, then he kicked.” (
[Deut. xxxii. 15](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#015.md) <span
id="v.xxxvii-p88.4"></span> .) For “the Lord is known when He executeth
judgments.” ( [Ps. ix. 16](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#016.md) <span
id="v.xxxvii-p88.5"></span> .)

<span id="v.xxxvii-p89"></span>\[9.\] Affliction is a great good.
“Narrow is the way” ( [Matt. vii. 14](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#014.md)
<span id="v.xxxvii-p89.1"></span> ), so that affliction  <span
id="fr_3490"></span>[3491](#fn_3490.md) thrusts us into the narrow \[way\].
He who is not pressed by affliction cannot enter. For he who afflicts
himself in the narrow \[way\], is he who also enjoys ease; but he that
spreads himself out,  <span id="fr_3491"></span>[3492](#fn_3491.md) does
not enter in, and suffers from being so to say wedged in.  <span
id="fr_3492"></span>[3493](#fn_3492.md) See how Paul enters into this
narrow way. He “keeps under” his “body” ( [1 Cor. ix.
27](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#027.md) <span id="v.xxxvii-p92.2"></span>
), so as to be able to enter. Therefore, in all his afflictions, he
continued giving thanks unto God. Hast thou lost thy property? This hath
lightened thee of the most of thy wideness. Hast thou fallen from glory?
This is <span id="page_518">p. 518</span> <span
id="v.xxxvii-Page_518"></span> another sort of wideness. Hast thou been
falsely accused? Have the things said against thee, of which thou art
nowise conscious to thyself been believed? “Rejoice and leap for joy.”
For “blessed are ye” (He says) “when men reproach you, and say all
manner of evil against you, falsely, for My sake. Rejoice and be
exceeding glad, for great is your reward in Heaven.” ( [Matt.
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#011.md),
[12](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#012.md)<span id="v.xxxvii-p92.3"></span>
.)

<span id="v.xxxvii-p93"></span>Why dost thou marvel, if thou art
grieved, and wish to be set free from temptations? Paul wished to be set
free, and oftentimes entreated God, and did not obtain. For the “thrice
for this I besought the Lord,” is oftentimes; “and He said unto me, My
grace is sufficient for thee, for My strength is made perfect in
weakness.” ( [2 Cor. 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#008.md),
[9](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#009)<span id="v.xxxvii-p93.1"></span> ..md)
By “weakness,” he here means “afflictions.” What then? When he heard
this he received it thankfully, and says, “Wherefore I take pleasure in
infirmities” ( [2 Cor. xii. 10](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#010.md) <span
id="v.xxxvii-p93.2"></span> ); that is, I am pleased, I rest in my
afflictions. For all things then let us give thanks, both for comfort,
and for affliction.  <span id="fr_3493"></span>[3494](#fn_3493.md) Let us
not murmur: let us not be unthankful. “Naked came I out of my mother’s
womb, naked also shall I depart.” ( [Job i.
21](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#021.md) <span id="v.xxxvii-p94.7"></span>
.) Thou didst not come forth glorious, do not seek glory. Thou wast
brought into life naked, not of money alone, but also of glory, and of
honorable name.

<span id="v.xxxvii-p95"></span>Consider how great evils have oftentimes
arisen from wealth. For “It is easier” (it is said) “for a camel to go
through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the
kingdom of Heaven.” ( [Matt. xix. 24](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#024.md)
<span id="v.xxxvii-p95.1"></span> .) Seest thou to how many good things
wealth is a hindrance, and dost thou seek to be rich? Dost thou not
rejoice that the hindrance has been overthrown? So narrow is the way
which leadeth into the Kingdom. So broad is wealth, and full of bulk and
swelling out. Therefore He says, “Sell that thou hast” ( [Matt. xix.
21](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#021.md) <span id="v.xxxvii-p95.2"></span>
), that that way may receive thee. Why dost thou yearn after wealth? For
this cause He took it away from thee, that He might free thee from
slavery. For true fathers also, when a son is corrupted by some
mistress, and having given him much exhortation they do not persuade him
to part from her, send the mistress into banishment. Such also is
abundance of wealth. Because the Lord cares for us, and delivers us from
the harm \[which arises\] therefrom, He takes away wealth from us.

<span id="v.xxxvii-p96"></span>Let us not then think poverty an evil:
sin is the only evil. For neither is wealth a good thing by itself: to
be well-pleasing to God is the only good. Poverty then let us seek, this
let us pursue: so shall we lay hold on heaven, so shall we attain to the
other good things. Which may we all attain by the grace and
lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, with whom to the Father
together with the Holy Ghost be glory, power, honor, now and ever and
world without end. Amen.
