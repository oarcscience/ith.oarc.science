<span id="iv.lvii-p2"></span> <span id="iv.lvii-p2.1"></span> <span

<span id="iv.lvii-p3"></span>“Then answered the Jews, and said unto Him,
Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil? Jesus
answered, I have not a devil; but I honor My Father.”

<span id="iv.lvii-p4"></span> \[1.\] <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.lvii-p4.1"></span> A shameless</span> and a forward  <span
id="fr_1488"></span>[1489](#fn_1488.md) thing is wickedness, and when it
ought to hide itself, then is it the fiercer. As was the case with the
Jews. For when they ought to have been pricked by what was said,
admiring the boldness and conclusiveness  <span
id="fr_1489"></span>[1490](#fn_1489.md) of the words, they even insult Him,
calling Him a Samaritan, and saying that He had a devil, and they ask,
“Said we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?” Because
when He uttereth anything sublime, this is thought among the very
senseless to be madness. Yet nowhere before did the Evangelist say that
they called Him “a Samaritan”; but from this expression it is probable
that this had been often asserted by them.

<span id="iv.lvii-p7"></span> “Thou hast a devil,” saith some one. Who
is it that hath a devil? He that honoreth God, or he that insulteth Him
that honoreth Him? What then saith Christ, who is very meekness and
gentleness? “I have not a devil, but I honor Him  <span
id="fr_1490"></span>[1491](#fn_1490.md) that sent me.” Where there was need
to instruct them, to pull down their excessive insolence, to teach them
not to be proud because of Abraham, He was vehement; but when it was
needful that He being insulted should bear it, He used much gentleness.
When they said, “We have God and Abraham for our Father,” He touched
them sharply; but when they called Him a demoniac, He spake
submissively, thus teaching us to avenge insults offered to God, but to
overlook such as are offered to ourselves.

<span id="iv.lvii-p9"></span> [John
8.50](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#050.md)<span id="iv.lvii-p9.1"></span> .
“I seek not Mine own glory.”

<span id="iv.lvii-p10"></span> “These things,” He saith, “I have spoken
to show that it becometh not you, being murderers, to call God your
Father; so that I have spoken them through honor for Him, and for His
sake do I hear these reproaches, and for His sake do ye dishonor Me. Yet
I care not for this insolence  <span
id="fr_1491"></span>[1492](#fn_1491.md) ; to Him, for whose sake I now hear
these things, ye owe an account of your words. For ‘I seek not Mine own
glory.’ Wherefore I omit to punish you, and betake Myself to
exhortation, and counsel you so to act, that ye shall not only escape
punishment, but also attain eternal life.”

<span id="iv.lvii-p12"></span> [John
8.51](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#051.md)<span id="iv.lvii-p12.1"></span> .
“Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep My saying, he shall never
see death.”

<span id="iv.lvii-p13"></span>Here He speaketh not of faith only, but of
a pure life. Above He said, “shall have everlasting life,” but here,
“shall not see death.” ( [John
6.40](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#040.md)<span id="iv.lvii-p13.1"></span>
.) At the same time He hinteth to them that they could do nothing
against Him, for if the man that should keep His saying should not die,
much less should He Himself. At least they understood it so, and said to
Him,

<span id="iv.lvii-p14"></span> [John
8.52](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#052.md)<span id="iv.lvii-p14.1"></span> .
“Now we know that thou hast a devil; Abraham is dead, and the Prophets
are dead.”

<span id="iv.lvii-p15"></span>That is, “they who heard the word of God
are dead, and shall they who have heard thine not die?”

<span id="iv.lvii-p16"></span> [John
8.53](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#053.md)<span id="iv.lvii-p16.1"></span> .
“Art thou greater than our father Abraham?”

<span id="iv.lvii-p17"></span> <span id="page_196">p. 196</span> <span
id="iv.lvii-Page_196"></span> Alas for their vainglory! Again do they
betake themselves to his relationship. Yet it would have been suitable
to say, “Art thou greater than God? or they who have heard thee than
Abraham?” But they say not this, because they thought that He was even
less than Abraham. At first, therefore, He showed that they were
murderers, and so led them away from the relationship; but when they
persevered, He contrived this in another way, showing that they labored
uselessly. And concerning the “death,” He said nothing to them, neither
did He reveal or tell them what kind of death He meant, but in the
meantime He would have them believe, that He is greater than Abraham,
that even by this He may put them to shame. “Certainly,” He saith, “were
I a common man I ought not to die, having done no wrong; but when I
speak the truth, and have no sin, am sent from God, and am greater than
Abraham, are ye not mad, do ye not labor in vain when ye attempt to kill
Me?” What then is their reply? “Now we know that thou hast a devil.” Not
so spake the woman of Samaria. She said not to Him, “Thou hast a devil”;
but only, “Art thou greater than our father Jacob?” ( [John
4.12](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#012.md)<span id="iv.lvii-p17.1"></span>
.) For these men were insolent and accursed, while she desired to learn;
wherefore she doubted and answered with proper moderation, and called
Him, “Lord.” For one who promised far greater things, and who was worthy
of credit, ought not to have been insulted, but even admired; yet these
men said that He had a devil. Those expressions of the Samaritan woman
were those of one in doubt; these were the words of men unbelieving and
perverse. “Art thou greater than our father Abraham?” so that this
(which He had said) maketh Him to be greater than Abraham. “When
therefore ye have seen Him lifted up,  <span
id="fr_1492"></span>[1493](#fn_1492.md) ye shall confess that He is
greater.” On this account He said, “When ye have lifted Me  <span
id="fr_1493"></span>[1494](#fn_1493.md) up, ye shall know that I Am.” (
[John 8.28](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#028.md)<span
id="iv.lvii-p19.3"></span> .) And observe His wisdom. Having first rent
them away from Abraham’s kindred, He showeth that He is greater than
Abraham, that so He may be seen to be very exceedingly greater than the
Prophets also. Indeed it was because they continually called Him a
prophet that He said, “My word hath no place in you.” ( [John
8.37](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#037.md)<span id="iv.lvii-p19.4"></span>
.) In that other place  <span id="fr_1494"></span>[1495](#fn_1494.md) He
declared that He raiseth the dead, but here He saith, “He that believeth
shall never see death,” which was a much greater thing than not to allow
believers to be holden, by death. Wherefore the Jews were the more
enraged. What then say they?

<span id="iv.lvii-p21"></span>“Whom makest thou thyself?”

<span id="iv.lvii-p22"></span>And this too in an insulting manner. “Thou
art taking somewhat upon thyself,” saith one of them. To this then
Christ replieth;

<span id="iv.lvii-p23"></span> [John
8.54](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#054.md)<span id="iv.lvii-p23.1"></span> .
“If I honor Myself, My honor is nothing.”

<span id="iv.lvii-p24"></span> \[2.\] What say the heretics here? That
He heard the question, “Art thou greater than our father Abraham?” and
dared not to say to them, “Yea, I am greater,” but did so in a covert
manner. What then? Is His honor “nothing”? With respect to them  <span
id="fr_1495"></span>[1496](#fn_1495.md) it is nothing. And as He said, “My
witness is not true” ( [John 5.31](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#031.md)<span
id="iv.lvii-p25.2"></span> ), with reference to the opinion they would
form of it, so also doth He speak here.

<span id="iv.lvii-p26"></span> “There is One  <span
id="fr_1496"></span>[1497](#fn_1496.md) that honoreth Me.”

<span id="iv.lvii-p28"></span>And wherefore said He not, “The Father
that sent Me,” as He did before, but,

<span id="iv.lvii-p29"></span>“Of whom ye say that He is your God.”

<span id="iv.lvii-p30"></span> [John
8.55](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#055.md)<span id="iv.lvii-p30.1"></span> .
“Yet ye have not known Him.” Because He desired to show that they not
only knew not His Father, but that they knew not God.

<span id="iv.lvii-p31"></span>“But I know Him.”

<span id="iv.lvii-p32"></span>“So that to say, ‘I know Him,’ is not a
boast, while to say, ‘I know Him not,’ would be a falsehood; but ye when
ye say that ye know Him, lie; as then ye, when ye say that ye know Him,
lie, so also should I, were I to say that I know Him not.”

<span id="iv.lvii-p33"></span> “If I honor Myself.” Since they said,
“Whom makest thou thyself?” He replieth, “If I make (Myself anything,)
My honor is nothing. As then I know Him exactly, so ye know Him not.”
And as in the case of Abraham, He did not take away their whole
assertion, but said, “I know that ye are Abraham’s seed,” so as to make
the charge against them heavier; thus here He doth not remove the whole,
but what? “Whom ye say.”  <span id="fr_1497"></span>[1498](#fn_1497.md) By
granting to them their boast of words, He increaseth the force of the
accusation against them. How then do ye “not know Him”? “Because ye
insult One who saith and doeth everything that He  <span
id="fr_1498"></span>[1499](#fn_1498.md) may be glorified, even when that
One is sent from Him.” This assertion is unsupported by testimony, but
what follows serves to establish it.

<span id="iv.lvii-p36"></span>“And I keep His saying.”

<span id="iv.lvii-p37"></span>Here they might, if at least they had
anything to say, have refuted Him, for it was the strongest proof of His
having been sent by God.

<span id="iv.lvii-p38"></span> [John
8.56](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#056.md)<span id="iv.lvii-p38.1"></span> .
“Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day, and he saw it, and was
glad.”

<span id="iv.lvii-p39"></span>Again, He showeth that they were aliens
from the race of Abraham, if they grieved at what he rejoiced in. “My
day,” seems to me to mean the day of the Crucifixion, which Abraham
foreshowed typically by the offering of the ram and of Isaac. What do
they reply?

<span id="iv.lvii-p40"></span> [John
8.57](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#057.md)<span id="iv.lvii-p40.1"></span> .
“Thou art not yet forty  <span id="fr_1499"></span>[1500](#fn_1499.md)
years old, and hast Thou seen Abraham?”

<span id="page_197">p. 197</span> <span id="iv.lvii-Page_197"></span>

<span id="iv.lvii-p42"></span> So that we conclude  <span
id="fr_1500"></span>[1501](#fn_1500.md) that Christ was nearly forty.

<span id="iv.lvii-p44"></span> [John
8:58](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#058.md),
[59](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#059.md)<span id="iv.lvii-p44.1"></span> .
“Jesus saith unto them, Before Abraham was, I Am. Then took they up
stones to cast at Him.”

<span id="iv.lvii-p45"></span>Seest thou how He proved Himself to be
greater than Abraham? For the man who rejoiced to see His day, and made
this an object of earnest desire, plainly did so because it was a day
that should be for a benefit, and belonging to one greater than himself.
Because they had said, “The carpenter’s son” ( [Matt. xiii.
55](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#055) <span id="iv.lvii-p45.1"></span> .md),
and imagined nothing more concerning Him, He leadeth them by degrees to
an exalted notion of Him. Therefore when they heard the words, “Ye know
not God,” they were not grieved; but when they heard, “before Abraham
was, I Am,” as though the nobility of their descent were debased, they
became furious, and would have stoned Him.

<span id="iv.lvii-p46"></span>“He saw My day, and was glad.” He showeth,
that not unwillingly He came to His Passion, since He praiseth him who
was gladdened at the Cross. For this was the salvation of the world. But
they cast stones at Him; so ready were they for murder, and they did
this of their own accord, without enquiry.

<span id="iv.lvii-p47"></span> But wherefore said He not, “Before
Abraham was, I was,” instead of “I Am”? As the Father useth this
expression, “I <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.lvii-p47.1"></span>Am</span> ,” so also doth Christ; for it
signifieth continuous Being, irrespective of all time. On which account
the expression seemed to them to be blasphemous. Now if they could not
bear the comparison with Abraham, although this was but a trifling one,
had He continually made Himself equal to the Father, would they ever
have ceased casting stones at Him?

<span id="iv.lvii-p48"></span> After this, again He fleeth as a man, and
concealeth Himself, having laid before them sufficient instruction: and
having accomplished His work, He went forth from the Temple, and
departed to heal the blind, proving by His actions that He is before
Abraham. But perhaps some one will say, “Why did He not paralyze their
strength?  <span id="fr_1501"></span>[1502](#fn_1501.md) So they would have
believed.” He healed the paralytic, yet they believed not; nay, He
wrought ten thousand wonders; at the very Passion He cast them to the
ground, and darkened their eyes, yet they believed not; and how would
they have believed if He had paralyzed their strength? There is nothing
worse than a soul hardened in desperation; though it see signs and
wonders, it still perseveres in retaining the same shamelessness. Thus
Pharaoh, who received ten thousand strokes, was sobered only while being
punished, and continued of this character until the last day of his
life, pursuing those whom he had let go. Wherefore Paul continually
saith, “Lest any of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.” (
[Heb. iii. 13](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#013.md) <span
id="iv.lvii-p49.2"></span> .) For as the callosities  <span
id="fr_1502"></span>[1503](#fn_1502.md) of the body, when formed, become
dead, and possess no sensation; so the soul, when it is occupied by many
passions, becomes dead to virtue; and apply what you will to it, it gets
no perception of the matter, but whether you threaten punishment or
anything else, continues insensible.

<span id="iv.lvii-p51"></span> \[3.\] Wherefore I beseech you, while we
have hopes of salvation, while we can turn, to use every means to do so.
For men who have become past feeling, are after that in the blind state
 <span id="fr_1503"></span>[1504](#fn_1503.md) of despairing pilots, who
give up their vessel to the wind, and themselves contribute no
assistance. Thus the envious man looks to one thing only, that is, to
satisfy his lust, and though he be like to be punished or even slain,
still he is possessed solely by that passion; and in like manner the
intemperate and avaricious. But if the sovereignty of the passions be so
great, much greater is that of virtue; if for them we despise death,
much more for this; if they (sinners) regard not their own lives, much
less ought we to do so in the cause of our salvation. For what shall we
have to say, if when they who perish are so active about their own
perdition, we for our own salvation manifest not even an equal activity,
but ever continue wasting with envy? Nothing is worse than envy; to
destroy another it destroys itself also. The eye of the envious wastes
away in grief, he lives in a continual death, he deems all men, even
those who have never wronged him, his enemies. He grieves that God is
honored, he rejoices in what the devil rejoices in. Is any honored among
men? This is not honor, envy him not. But is he honored by God? Strive
and be thou like him. Thou wilt not? Why then dost thou destroy thyself
too? Why castest thou away what thou hast? Canst thou not be like unto
him, nor gain any good thing? Why then dost thou besides this take for
thyself evil, when thou oughtest to rejoice with him, that so even if
thou be not able to share his toils, thou mayest profit by rejoicing
with Him? For often even the will is able to effect great good. At least
Ezekiel saith, that the Moabites were punished because they rejoiced
over the Israelites, and that certain others were saved because they
mourned over the misfortunes of their neighbors. ( [Ezek. xxv.
8](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#008) <span id="iv.lvii-p52.4"></span> ..md)
Now if there be any comfort for those who mourn over the woes of others,
much more for those who rejoice at the honors of others. He charged the
Moabites <span id="page_198">p. 198</span> <span
id="iv.lvii-Page_198"></span> with having exulted over the Israelites,
yet it was God that punished them; but not even when He punisheth will
He have us rejoice over those that are punished. For it is not His wish
to punish them. Now if we must condole with those who are punished, much
more must we avoid envying those who are honored. Thus, for example,
Corah and Dathan perished with their company, making those whom they
envied brighter, and giving themselves up to punishment. For a venomous
beast is envy, an unclean beast, a deliberate vice which admits not of
pardon, a wickedness stripped of excuse, the cause and mother of all
evils. Wherefore let us pluck it up by the roots, that we may be freed
from evil here, and may obtain blessings hereafter; through the grace
and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom and with whom, to
the Father and the Holy Ghost, be glory now and ever and world without
end. Amen.
