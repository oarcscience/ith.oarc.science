<span id="iv.lxvi-p2"></span> <span id="iv.lxvi-p2.1"></span> <span
class="c1"><span id="iv.lxvi-p2.2"></span>[John

id="iv.lxvi-p2.3"></span></span>

<span id="iv.lxvi-p3"></span>“Jesus lifted up His eyes, and said,
Father, I thank Thee that Thou hast heard Me; and I knew that Thou
hearest Me always, but because of the people which stand by, I said it.”
And what follows.

<span id="iv.lxvi-p4"></span> \[1.\] <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.lxvi-p4.1"></span>What</span> I have often said, I will now say,
that Christ looketh not so much to His own honor as to our salvation;
not how He may utter some sublime saying, but how something able to draw
us to Him. On which account His sublime and mighty sayings are few, and
those also hidden, but the humble and lowly are many, and abound  <span
id="fr_1779"></span>[1780](#fn_1779.md) through His discourses. For since
by these men were the rather brought over, in these He continueth; and
He doth not on the one hand utter these  <span
id="fr_1780"></span>[1781](#fn_1780.md) universally, lest the men that
should come after should receive damage, nor, on the other hand, doth He
entirely withhold those,  <span id="fr_1781"></span>[1782](#fn_1781.md)
lest the men of that time should be offended. Since they who have passed
from lowmindedness unto perfection,  <span
id="fr_1782"></span>[1783](#fn_1782.md) will be able from even a single
sublime doctrine to discern the whole, but those who were ever
lowminded, unless they had often heard these lowly sayings,  <span
id="fr_1783"></span>[1784](#fn_1783.md) would not have come to Him  <span
id="fr_1784"></span>[1785](#fn_1784.md) at all. In fact, even after so many
such sayings they do not remain firm, but even stone and persecute Him,
and try to kill Him, and call Him blasphemer. And when He maketh Himself
equal with God, they say, “This man blasphemeth” ( [Matt. ix.
3](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#003) <span id="iv.lxvi-p10.3"></span> .md);
and when He saith, “Thy sins be forgiven thee” ( [John
10.20](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#020.md)<span id="iv.lxvi-p10.4"></span>
), they moreover call Him a demoniac. So when He saith that the man who
heareth His words is stronger than death, or, “I am in the Father and
the Father in Me” ( [John 8.51](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#051.md)<span
id="iv.lxvi-p10.5"></span> ), they leave Him; and again, they are
offended when He saith that He came down from heaven. ( [John
6:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#033.md),
[60](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#060)<span id="iv.lxvi-p10.6"></span> ..md)
If now they could not bear these sayings, though seldom uttered,
scarcely, had His discourse been always sublime, had it been of this
texture, would they have given heed to Him? When therefore He saith, “As
the Father commanded Me, so I speak”  <span
id="fr_1785"></span>[1786](#fn_1785.md) ( [John
14.31](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#031.md)<span id="iv.lxvi-p11.3"></span>
); and, “I am not come  <span id="fr_1786"></span>[1787](#fn_1786.md) of
Myself” ( [John 7.28](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#028.md)<span
id="iv.lxvi-p12.3"></span> ), then they believe. That they did believe
then is clear, from the Evangelist signifying this besides, and saying,
“As He spake these words, many believed on Him.” ( [John
5.30](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#030.md)<span id="iv.lxvi-p12.4"></span>
.) If then lowly speaking drew men to  <span
id="fr_1787"></span>[1788](#fn_1787.md) faith, and high speaking scared
them away,  <span id="fr_1788"></span>[1789](#fn_1788.md) must it not be a
mark of extreme folly not to see at a glance how to reckon  <span
id="fr_1789"></span>[1790](#fn_1789.md) the sole reason of those lowly
sayings, namely, that they were uttered because of the hearers. Since in
another place when He had desired to say some high thing, He withheld
it, adding this reason, and saying, “Lest we should offend them, cast a
hook into the sea.” ( [Matt. xvii. 27](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#027.md)
<span id="iv.lxvi-p15.3"></span> .) Which also He doth here; for after
saying, “I know that Thou hearest Me always,” He addeth, “but because of
the multitude which standeth around I said it, that they might believe.”
Are these words ours? Is this a human conjecture? When then a man will
not endure to be persuaded by what is written, that  <span
id="fr_1790"></span>[1791](#fn_1790.md) they were offended at sublime
things, how, when he heareth Christ saying that He spake in a lowly
manner that they might not be offended, how, after that, shall he
suspect that the mean sayings belonged to His nature, not to His
condescension?  <span id="fr_1791"></span>[1792](#fn_1791.md) So in another
place, when a voice came down from heaven, He said, “This voice came not
because of Me, but for your sakes.” ( [John
12.30](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#030.md)<span id="iv.lxvi-p17.4"></span>
.) He who is exalted may be allowed to speak lowly things of himself,
but it is not lawful for the humble to utter concerning himself anything
grand or sublime.  For the former ariseth from condescension, and has
for its cause the weakness of the hearers; or rather (it has for its
cause) the leading them to  <span id="fr_1792"></span>[1793](#fn_1792.md)
humblemindedness, and His being clothed in flesh, and the teaching the
hearers to say nothing great concerning themselves, and His being deemed
an enemy of God, and not being believed to have come from God, His being
suspected of breaking the Law, and the fact that the hearers looked on
Him with an evil eye, and were ill disposed towards Him, because He said
that He was equal to God.  <span id="fr_1793"></span>[1794](#fn_1793.md)
But that a lowly man should say any great thing of Himself, hath no
cause either reasonable or unreasonable;  <span
id="fr_1794"></span>[1795](#fn_1794.md) it can only be folly, impudence,
and unpardonable boldness. Wherefore then doth Christ speak humbly,
being of that ineffable and great Substance? For the reasons mentioned,
and that He might not be deemed unbegotten; for Paul seems to have <span
id="page_235">p. 235</span> <span id="iv.lxvi-Page_235"></span> feared
some such thing as this; wherefore he saith, “Except Him who did put all
things under Him.” ( [1 Cor. xv. 27](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#027.md)
<span id="iv.lxvi-p20.3"></span> .) This it is impious even to think of.
Since if being less than Him who begat Him, and of a different
Substance, He had been deemed equal, would He not have used every means
that this might not be thought? But now He doth the contrary, saying,
“If I do not the works of Him that sent Me,  <span
id="fr_1795"></span>[1796](#fn_1795.md) believe Me not.” ( [John
10.37](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#037.md)<span id="iv.lxvi-p21.3"></span>
.) Indeed His saying, that “I am in the Father and the Father in Me” (
[John 14.10](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#010.md)<span
id="iv.lxvi-p21.4"></span> ), intimateth to us the equality. It would
have behooved, if He had been inferior, to refute this opinion with much
vehemence, and not at all to have said, “I am in the Father and the
Father in me” ( [John 10.30](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#030.md)<span
id="iv.lxvi-p21.5"></span> ), or that, “We are One,” or that, “He that
hath seen Me, hath seen the Father.” ( [John
14.9](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#009.md)<span id="iv.lxvi-p21.6"></span>
.) Thus also, when His discourse was concerning power, He said, “I and
the Father are One”; and when His discourse was concerning authority, He
said again, “For as the Father raiseth up the dead and quickeneth them,
even so the Son quickeneth whom He wilt” ( [John
5.21](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#021.md)<span id="iv.lxvi-p21.7"></span>
); which it would be impossible that He should do were He of a different
substance; or even allowing that it were possible, yet it would not have
behooved to say this, lest they should suspect that the substance was
one and the same. Since if in order that they may not suppose Him to be
an enemy of God, He often even uttereth words unsuited to Him, much more
should He then have done so; but now, His saying, “That they should
honor the Son even as they honor the Father” ( [John
5.23](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#023.md)<span id="iv.lxvi-p21.8"></span>
); His saying, “The works which He doeth, I do also” ( [John
5.19](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#019.md)<span id="iv.lxvi-p21.9"></span>
); His saying that He is “the Resurrection, and the Life, and the Light
of the world” ( [John 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#025.md), [John
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#012.md)<span id="iv.lxvi-p21.10"></span>
), are the expressions of One making Himself equal to Him who begat Him,
and confirming the suspicion which they entertained. Seest thou  <span
id="fr_1796"></span>[1797](#fn_1796.md) how He maketh this speech and
defense, to show that He broke not the Law, and that He not only doth
not remove, but even confirmeth the opinion of His equality with the
Father? So also when they said, “Thou blasphemest, because thou makest
thyself God” ( [John 10.33](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#033.md)<span
id="iv.lxvi-p22.4"></span> ), from equality of works He established this
thing.

<span id="iv.lxvi-p23"></span> \[2.\] And why say I that  <span
id="fr_1797"></span>[1798](#fn_1797.md) the Son did this, when the Father
also who took not  <span id="fr_1798"></span>[1799](#fn_1798.md) the flesh
doeth the same thing? For He also endured that many lowly things should
be said concerning Him for the salvation of the hearers. For the, “Adam,
where art thou?” ( [Gen. iii. 9](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#009.md) <span
id="iv.lxvi-p25.3"></span> ), and, “That I may know whether they have
done altogether according to the cry of it” ( [Gen. xviii.
21](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#021) <span id="iv.lxvi-p25.4"></span> .md);
and, “Now I know that thou fearest God” ( [Gen. xxii.
12](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#012) <span id="iv.lxvi-p25.5"></span> .md);
and, “If they will hear” ( [Ezek. iii.
11](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#011) <span id="iv.lxvi-p25.6"></span> .md);
and, “If they will understand” ( [Deut. v.
29](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#029) <span id="iv.lxvi-p25.7"></span> .md);
and, “Who shall give the heart of this people to be so?” and the
expression, “There is none like unto Thee among the gods, O Lord” ( [Ps.
lxxx. 29](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#029.md) <span
id="iv.lxvi-p25.8"></span> ); these and many other like sentences in the
Old Testament, if a man should pick them out, he will find to be
unworthy of the dignity of God. In the case of Ahab it is said, “Who
shall entice Ahab for Me?” ( [2 Chron. xviii.
19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2018.htm#019) <span id="iv.lxvi-p25.9"></span> ..md)
And the continually preferring Himself to the gods of the heathen in the
way of comparison, all these things are unworthy of God. Yet in another
way they are made worthy of Him, for He is so kind, that for our
salvation He careth not for expressions which become His dignity.
Indeed, the becoming man is unworthy of Him, and the taking the form of
a servant, and the speaking humble words, and the being clothed in
 <span id="fr_1799"></span>[1800](#fn_1799) humble (garments.md), unworthy
if one looks to His dignity, but worthy if one consider the unspeakable
riches  <span id="fr_1800"></span>[1801](#fn_1800.md) of His
lovingkindness. And there is another cause of the humility of His words.
What is that? It is that they knew and confessed  <span
id="fr_1801"></span>[1802](#fn_1801.md) the Father, but Him they knew not.
Wherefore He continually betaketh Himself to the Father as being
confessed by them, because He Himself was not as yet deemed worthy of
credit; not on account of any inferiority of His own, but because of the
folly and infirmity of the hearers. On this account He prayeth, and
saith, “Father, I thank Thee that Thou hast heard Me.” For if He
quickeneth whom He will, and quickeneth in like manner as doth the
Father, wherefore doth He call upon Him?

<span id="iv.lxvi-p29"></span> But it is time now to go through the
passage from the beginning.  <span id="fr_1802"></span>[1803](#fn_1802.md)
“Then they took up the stone where the dead man lay. And Jesus lifted up
His eyes, and said, Father, I thank Thee that Thou hast heard Me. And I
knew that Thou hearest Me always, but because of the people that stand
by I said it, that they might believe that Thou hast sent Me.” Let us
then ask the heretic, Did He receive an impulse  <span
id="fr_1803"></span>[1804](#fn_1803.md) from the prayer, and so raise the
dead man? How then did He work other miracles without prayer? saying,
“Thou evil spirit, I charge thee, come out of him” ( [Mark ix.
25](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#025) <span id="iv.lxvi-p31.3"></span> .md);
and, “I will, be thou clean” ( [Mark i.
41](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#041) <span id="iv.lxvi-p31.4"></span> .md);
and, “Arise, take up thy bed” ( [John
5.8](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#008)<span id="iv.lxvi-p31.5"></span> .md);
and, “Thy sins be forgiven thee” ( [Matt. ix.
2](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#002) <span id="iv.lxvi-p31.6"></span> .md);
and to the sea, “Peace, be still.” ( [Mark iv.
39](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#039) <span id="iv.lxvi-p31.7"></span> ..md)
In short, what hath He more than the Apostles, if so be that He also
worketh by  <span id="fr_1804"></span>[1805](#fn_1804.md) prayer? Or rather
I should say, that neither did they work all with prayer, but often they
wrought without prayer, <span id="page_236">p. 236</span> <span
id="iv.lxvi-Page_236"></span> calling upon the Name of Jesus. Now, if
His Name had such great power, how could He have needed prayer? Had He
needed prayer, His Name would not have availed. When He wholly made man,
what manner of prayer did He need? was there not then great equality of
honor? “Let Us make,” It saith, “man.” ( [Gen. i.
26](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#026) <span id="iv.lxvi-p32.3"></span> ..md)
What could be greater sign of weakness, if He needed prayer? But let us
see what the prayer was; “I thank Thee that Thou hast heard Me.” Who now
ever prayed in this manner? Before uttering any prayer, He saith, “I
thank Thee,” showing that He needed not prayer.  <span
id="fr_1805"></span>[1806](#fn_1805.md) “And I knew that Thou hearest Me
always.” This He said not as though He Himself were powerless, but to
show that His will and the Father’s is one. But why did He assume the
form of prayer? Hear, not me, but Himself, saying, “For the sake of the
people which stand by, that they may believe that Thou hast sent Me.” He
said not, "That they may believe that I am inferior, that I have need of
an impulse from above, that without prayer I cannot do anything; but,
“That Thou hast sent Me.” For all these things the prayer declareth, if
we take it simply. He said not, “Thou hast sent me weak, acknowledging
servitude, and doing nothing of Myself”; but dismissing all these
things, that thou mayest have no such suspicions, He putteth the real
cause of the prayer, “That they may not deem Me an enemy of God; that
they may not say, He is not of God, that I may show them that the work
hath been done according to Thy will.” All but saying, “Had I been an
enemy of God, what is done would not have succeeded,” but the, “Thou
heardest Me,” is said in the case of friends and equals. “And I knew
that Thou hearest Me always,” that is, “in order that My will be done I
need no prayer, except to persuade men that to Thee and Me belongeth one
will.” “Why then prayest Thou?” For the sake of the weak and grosser
 <span id="fr_1806"></span>[1807](#fn_1806.md) sort.

<span id="iv.lxvi-p35"></span> [John
11.43](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#043.md)<span id="iv.lxvi-p35.1"></span>
. “And when He had thus spoken, He cried with a loud voice.”

<span id="iv.lxvi-p36"></span>Why said He not, “In the name of My Father
come forth”? Or why said He not, “Father, raise him up”? Why did he omit
all these expressions, and after assuming the attitude of one praying,
show by His actions His independent authority? Because this also was a
part of His wisdom, to show condescension by words, but by His deeds,
power. For since they had nothing else to charge Him with except that He
was not of God, and since in this way they deceived many, He on this
account most abundantly proveth this very point by what He saith, and in
the way that their infirmity required. For it was in His power by other
means to show at once His agreement with the Father and His own dignity,
but the multitude could not ascend so far. And He saith,

<span id="iv.lxvi-p37"></span>“Lazarus, come forth.”

<span id="iv.lxvi-p38"></span>\[3.\] This is that of which He spake,
“The hour is coming, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of
God, and they that hear shall live.” ( [John
5.28](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#028.md)<span id="iv.lxvi-p38.1"></span>
.) For, that thou mightest not think that He received the power of
working from another, He taught thee this before, and gave proof by
deeds, and said not, Arise, but, “Come forth,” conversing with the dead
man as though living. What can be equal to this authority? And if He
doth it not by His own strength, what shall He have more than the
Apostles, who say, “Why look ye so earnestly on us as though by our own
power or holiness we had made this man to walk?” ( [Acts iii.
12](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#012) <span id="iv.lxvi-p38.2"></span> ..md)
For if, not working by His own power, He did not add what the Apostles
said concerning themselves, they will in a manner be more truly wise
than He, because they refused the glory. And  <span
id="fr_1807"></span>[1808](#fn_1807.md) in another place, “Why do ye these
things? We also are men of like passions as you.” ( [Acts xiv.
15](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#015) <span id="iv.lxvi-p39.6"></span> ..md)
The Apostles since they did nothing of themselves, spoke in this way to
persuade men of this; but He when the like opinion was formed concerning
Him, would He not have removed the suspicion, if at least He did not act
by His own authority? Who would assert this? But in truth Christ doeth
the contrary, when He saith,  <span id="fr_1808"></span>[1809](#fn_1808.md)
“Because of the people which stand by I said it, that they might
believe”; so that had they believed, there would have been no need of
prayer. Now if prayer were not beneath His dignity, why should He
account them the cause of His praying? Why said He not, “I do it in
order that they may believe that I am not equal to Thee”; for He ought
on account of the suspicion to have come to this point. When He was
suspected of breaking the Law, He used the very expression, even when
they had not said anything, “Think not that I am come to destroy the
Law” ( [Matt. v. 17](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#017.md) <span
id="iv.lxvi-p40.4"></span> ); but in this place He establisheth their
suspicion. In fact, what need was there at all of going such a round,
and of using such dark sayings? It had been enough to say, “I am not
equal,” and to be rid of the matter. “But what,” saith some one, “did He
not say that, I do not My own will?” Even this He did in a covert way,
and one suited to their infirmity, and from the same cause through which
the prayer was made. But what meaneth “That Thou hast heard Me”? It
meaneth,  <span id="fr_1809"></span>[1810](#fn_1809.md) “That there is
nothing on My part opposed to Thee.” As then the, “That Thou hast heard
Me,” is not <span id="page_237">p. 237</span> <span
id="iv.lxvi-Page_237"></span> the saying of one declaring, that of
Himself He had not the power, (for were this the case, it would be not
only impotence but ignorance, if before praying He did not know that God
would grant the prayer; and if He knew not, how was it that He said, “I
go that I may awake him,” instead of, “I go to pray My Father to awake
him?”) As then this expression is a sign, not of weakness, but of
identity of will, so also is the, “Thou hearest Me always.” We must then
either say this, or else that it was addressed to their suspicions. If
now He was neither ignorant nor weak, it is clear that He uttereth these
lowly words, that thou mayest be persuaded by their very excess, and
mayest be compelled to confess, that they suit not His dignity, but are
from condescension. What then say the enemies of truth? “He spake not
those words, Thou hast heard me,” saith some one, “to the infirmity of
the hearers, but in order to show a superiority.” Yet this was not to
show a superiority,  <span id="fr_1810"></span>[1811](#fn_1810.md) but to
humble Himself greatly, and to show Himself as having nothing more than
man. For to pray is not proper to God, nor to the sharer of the Throne.
Seest thou then that He came to this  <span
id="fr_1811"></span>[1812](#fn_1811.md) from no other cause than their
unbelief? Observe at least that the action beareth witness to His
authority.

<span id="iv.lxvi-p44"></span> “He called, and the dead man came forth
wrapped.”  <span id="fr_1812"></span>[1813](#fn_1812.md) Then that the
matter might not seem to be an appearance, (for his coming forth bound
did not seem to be less marvelous than his resurrection,) Jesus
commanded to loose him, in order that having touched and having been
near him, they might see that it was really he. And He saith,

<span id="iv.lxvi-p46"></span>“Let him go.”

<span id="iv.lxvi-p47"></span> Seest thou His freedom from boastfulness?
He doth not lead him on, nor bid him go about  <span
id="fr_1813"></span>[1814](#fn_1813.md) with Him, lest He should seem to
any to be showing him; so well knew He how to observe moderation.

<span id="iv.lxvi-p49"></span> When the sign had been wrought, some
wondered, others went and told it to the Pharisees.  <span
id="fr_1814"></span>[1815](#fn_1814.md) What then did they? When they ought
to have been astonished and to have admired Him, they took counsel to
kill Him who had raised the dead. What folly! They thought to give up to
death Him who had overcome death in the bodies of others.

<span id="iv.lxvi-p51"></span> [John
11.47](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#047.md)<span id="iv.lxvi-p51.1"></span>
. “And they said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles.”

<span id="iv.lxvi-p52"></span>They still call Him “man,” these who had
received such proof of His divinity. “What do we?” They ought to have
believed, and served, and bowed down to Him, and no longer to have
deemed Him a man.

<span id="iv.lxvi-p53"></span> [John
11.48](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#048.md)<span id="iv.lxvi-p53.1"></span>
. “If we let him thus alone, the Romans will come,  <span
id="fr_1815"></span>[1816](#fn_1815.md) and will take away both our nation
and city.”  <span id="fr_1816"></span>[1817](#fn_1816.md)

<span id="iv.lxvi-p56"></span> What is it which they counsel to do?
 <span id="fr_1817"></span>[1818](#fn_1817.md) They wish to stir up the
people, as though they themselves would be in danger on suspicion of
establishing a kingdom. “For if,” saith one of them, “the Romans learn
 <span id="fr_1818"></span>[1819](#fn_1818.md) that this Man is leading the
multitudes, they will suspect us,  <span
id="fr_1819"></span>[1820](#fn_1819.md) and will come and destroy our
city.” Wherefore, tell me? Did He teach revolt? Did He not permit you to
give tribute to Cæsar? Did not ye wish to make Him a king, and He fly
from you? Did He not follow  <span id="fr_1820"></span>[1821](#fn_1820.md)
a mean and unpretending  <span id="fr_1821"></span>[1822](#fn_1821.md)
life, having neither house nor anything else of the kind? They therefore
said this, not from any such expectation, but from malice. Yet it so
fell out contrary to their expectation, and the Romans took their nation
and city when they had slain Christ. For the things done by Him were
beyond all suspicion. For He who healed the sick, and taught the most
excellent way of life, and commanded men to obey their rulers, was not
establishing but undoing a tyranny. “But,” saith some one, “we
conjecture from former (impostors).” But they taught revolt, He the
contrary. Seest thou that the words were but a pretense? For what action
of the kind did He exhibit? Did He lead about with Him  <span
id="fr_1822"></span>[1823](#fn_1822.md) pompous  <span
id="fr_1823"></span>[1824](#fn_1823.md) guards? had He a train of chariots?
Did He not seek the deserts? But they, that they may not seem to be
speaking from their own ill feeling,  <span
id="fr_1824"></span>[1825](#fn_1824.md) say that all the city is in danger,
that the common weal is being plotted against, and that they have to
fear the worst. These were not the causes of your captivity, but things
contrary to them; both of this last, and of the Babylonish, and of that
under Antiochus which followed: it was not that there were worshipers
among you, but that there were among you those who did unjustly, and
excited God to wrath, this caused you to be given up into bondage. But
such a thing is envy, allowing men to see nothing which they ought to
see, when it has once for all blinded the soul. Did He not teach men to
be meek? Did He not bid them when smitten on the right cheek to turn the
other also? Did He not bid them when injured to bear it? to show greater
readi <span id="page_238">p. 238</span> <span
id="iv.lxvi-Page_238"></span> ness to endure evil, than others have to
inflict it? Are these, tell me, the signs of one establishing a tyranny,
and not rather of one pulling a tyranny down?

<span id="iv.lxvi-p65"></span> \[4.\] But, as I said, a dreadful thing
is malice, and full of hypocrisy; this hath filled the world with ten
thousand evils; through this malady the law courts are filled, from this
comes the desire of fame and wealth, from this the love of rule, and
insolence,  <span id="fr_1825"></span>[1826](#fn_1825.md) through this the
roads have wicked robbers and the sea pirates,  <span
id="fr_1826"></span>[1827](#fn_1826.md) from this proceed the murders
through the world, through this our race is rent asunder, and whatever
evil thou mayest see, thou wilt perceive to arise from this. This hath
even burst into  <span id="fr_1827"></span>[1828](#fn_1827.md) the
churches, this hath caused ten thousand dreadful things from the
beginning, this is the mother of avarice, this malady hath turned all
things upside down, and corrupted justice. For “gifts,” It saith, “blind
the eyes of the wise, and as a muzzle on the mouth turn away reproofs.”
( [Ecclesiasticus 20.29](../../../bib/apo/sir020.htm#029.md)<span
id="iv.lxvi-p68.2"></span> , LXX. and marg. of E.V.) This makes slaves
of freemen, concerning this we talk every day, and no good comes of it,
we become worse than wild beasts; we plunder orphans, strip widows, do
wrong to the poor, join woe to woe. “Alas! that the righteous hath
perished from the earth!” ( [Mic. 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#001.md),
[2](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#002)<span id="iv.lxvi-p68.3"></span> ..md)
It is our part too henceforth to mourn, or rather we have need to say
this every day. We profit nothing by our prayers, nothing by our advice
and exhortation, it remaineth therefore that we weep. Thus did Christ;
after having many times exhorted those in Jerusalem, when they profited
nothing, He wept at their hardness.  <span
id="fr_1828"></span>[1829](#fn_1828.md) This also do the Prophets, and this
let us do now. Henceforth is the season for mourning and tears and
wailing; it is seasonable for us also to say now, “Call for the mourning
women, and send for the cunning women, that they may cry aloud” ( [Jer.
ix. 17](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#017.md) <span
id="iv.lxvi-p69.3"></span> ); perhaps thus we shall be able to cast out
the malady of those who build splendid houses, of those who surround
themselves with lands gotten by rapine. It is seasonable to mourn; but
do ye take part with me in the mourning, ye who have been stripped and
injured, by your mournings bring down my tears. But while mourning we
will mourn, not for ourselves but for them; they have not injured you,
but they have destroyed themselves; for you have the Kingdom of heaven
in return for the injustice done you, they hell in return for their
gain. On this account it is better to be injured than to injure. Let us
bewail them with a lamentation not of man’s making,  <span
id="fr_1829"></span>[1830](#fn_1829.md) but that from the Holy Scriptures
with which the Prophets also wailed. With Isaiah let us wail bitterly,
and say, “Woe, they that add house to house, that lay field to field,
that they may take somewhat from their neighbor; will ye dwell alone
upon the earth? Great houses and fair, and there shall be no inhabitants
in them.” ( [Isa. 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#008.md),
[9](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#009)<span id="iv.lxvi-p70.3"></span> ..md)

<span id="iv.lxvi-p71"></span>Let us mourn with Nahum, and say with him,
“Woe to him that buildeth his house on high.” (Perhaps [Jer. xxii.
13](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#013) <span id="iv.lxvi-p71.1"></span> ..md)
Or rather let us mourn for them as Christ mourned for those of old. “Woe
to you that are rich, for ye have received your consolation.” ( [Luke
vi. 24](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#024.md) <span
id="iv.lxvi-p71.2"></span> .) Let us, I beseech you, not cease thus
lamenting, and if it be not unseemly, let us even beat our breasts for
the carelessness of our brethren. Let us not weep for him who is already
dead, but let us weep for the rapacious man, the grasping, the covetous,
the insatiable. Why should we mourn for the dead, in whose case it is
impossible henceforth to effect anything? Let us mourn for these who are
capable even of change. But while we are lamenting, perhaps they will
laugh. Even this is a worthy cause for lamentation, that they laugh when
they ought to mourn. For had they been at all affected by our sorrows,
it would have behooved us to cease from sorrowing on account of their
promise of amendment; but since they are of an insensible disposition,
let us continue to weep, not merely for the rich, but for the lovers of
money, the greedy, the rapacious. Wealth is not an evil thing, (for we
may use it rightly when we spend it upon those who have need,) but
greediness is an evil, and it prepares  <span
id="fr_1830"></span>[1831](#fn_1830.md) deathless punishments. Let us then
bewail them; perhaps there will be some amendment; or even if they who
have fallen in do not escape, others at least will not fall into the
danger, but will guard against it. May it come to pass that both they
may be freed from their malady, and that none of us may ever fall into
it, that we all may in common obtain the promised goods, through the
grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory for
ever and ever.  Amen.
