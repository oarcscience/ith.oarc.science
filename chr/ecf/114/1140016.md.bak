class="c1"><span id="iv.xiii-p2.2"></span>[John i.
14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014.md)<span
id="iv.xiii-p2.3"></span></span>

<span id="iv.xiii-p3"></span>“And the Word was made Flesh, and dwelt
among us.”

<span id="iv.xiii-p4"></span> \[1.\] <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.xiii-p4.1"></span>I desire</span> to ask one favor of you all,
before I touch on the words of the Gospel; do not you refuse my request,
for I ask nothing heavy or burdensome, nor, if granted, will it be
useful only to me who receive, but also to you who grant it, and perhaps
far more so to you. What then is it that I require of you? That each of
you take in hand that section of the Gospels which is to be read among
you on the first day of the week, or even on the Sabbath, and before the
day arrive, that he sit down at home and read it through, and often
carefully consider its contents, and examine all its parts well, what
 <span id="fr_245"></span>[246](#fn_245.md) is clear, what obscure,  <span
id="fr_246"></span>[247](#fn_246.md) what seems to make for the
adversaries,  <span id="fr_247"></span>[248](#fn_247.md) but does not
really so; and when you have tried,  <span
id="fr_248"></span>[249](#fn_248.md) in a word  <span
id="fr_249"></span>[250](#fn_249.md) every point, so go to hear it read.
For from zeal like this will be no small gain both to you and to us. We
shall not need much labor to render clear the meaning of what is said,
because your minds will be already made familiar with the sense of the
words, and you will become keener and more clear-sighted not for hearing
only, nor for learning, but also for the teaching of others. Since, in
the way that now most of those who come hither hear, compelled to take
in the meaning of all at once, both the words, and the remarks we make
upon them, they will not, though we should go on doing this for a whole
year, reap any great gain. How can they, when they have leisure for what
is said as a bywork,  <span id="fr_250"></span>[251](#fn_250.md) and only
in this place, and for this short time? If any lay the fault on
business, and cares, and constant occupation in public and private
matters, in the first place, this is no slight charge in itself, that
they are surrounded with such a multitude of business, are so
continually nailed to the things of this life, that they cannot find
even a little leisure for what is more needful than all. Besides, that
this is a mere pretext and excuse, their meetings with friends would
prove against them, their loitering in the theaters, and the parties
 <span id="fr_251"></span>[252](#fn_251.md) they make to see horse races,
at which they often spend whole days, yet never in that case does one of
them complain of the pressure of business. For trifles then you can
without making any excuses, always find abundant leisure; but when you
ought to attend to the things of God, do these seem to you so utterly
superfluous and mean, that you think you need not assign even a little
leisure to them? How do men of such disposition deserve to breathe or to
look upon this sun?

<span id="iv.xiii-p12"></span> There is another most foolish excuse of
these sluggards; that they have not the books in their possession. Now
as to the rich, it is ludicrous that we should take our aim at  <span
id="fr_252"></span>[253](#fn_252.md) this excuse; but because I imagine
that many of the poorer sort continually use it, I would gladly ask, if
every one of them does not have all the instruments of the trade which
he works at, full and complete, though infinite  <span
id="fr_253"></span>[254](#fn_253.md) poverty stand in his way? Is it not
then a strange thing, in that case to throw no blame on poverty, but to
use every means that there be no obstacle from any quarter, but, when we
might gain such great advantage, to lament our want of leisure and our
poverty?

<span id="iv.xiii-p15"></span> Besides, even if any should be so poor,
it is in their power, by means of the continual reading of the holy
Scriptures which takes place here, to be ignorant of nothing contained
in them. Or if this seems to you impossible, it seems so with reason;
for many do not come with fervent zeal to hearken to what is said, but
having done this one thing  <span id="fr_254"></span>[255](#fn_254.md) for
form’s sake  <span id="fr_255"></span>[256](#fn_255.md) on our account,
 <span id="fr_256"></span>[257](#fn_256.md) immediately return home. Or if
any should stay, they are no better disposed than those who have
retired, since they are only present here with us in body. But that we
may not overload you with accusations, and spend all the time in finding
fault, let us proceed to the words of the Gospel, for it is time to
direct the remainder of our discourse to what is set before us. Rouse
yourselves therefore, that nothing of what is said escape you.

<span id="iv.xiii-p19"></span>“And the Word was made Flesh,” he saith,
“and dwelt among us.”

<span id="iv.xiii-p20"></span> Having declared that they who received
Him were “born of God,” and had become “sons of God,” he adds the cause
and reason of this unspeakable honor. It is that “the Word became
Flesh,” that the Master took on Him the form of a servant. For He became
Son of man, who was God’s own  <span id="fr_257"></span>[258](#fn_257.md)
Son, in order that He might make the sons of men to be children of God.
For the high when it associates with the low touches not at all its own
honor, while it raises up the other from its excessive lowness; and even
thus it was with the Lord. He in nothing diminished His own Nature by
this condescension,  <span id="fr_258"></span>[259](#fn_258.md) but raised
us, who had always sat in disgrace and darkness, to glory unspeakable.
Thus it may be, a king, conversing with interest and kindness with a
poor mean man, does not at all shame himself, yet makes the other
observed by all and illustrious. Now if in the case of the adventitious
dignity of men, intercourse with the humbler person in nothing injures
the more honorable, much less can it do so in the case of that simple
and blessed Essence which has nothing adventitious, or subject to growth
or decay, but has  <span id="fr_259"></span>[260](#fn_259.md) all good
things immovable, and fixed for ever. So that when you hear that “the
Word became Flesh,” be not disturbed nor cast down. For that Essence did
not change  <span id="fr_260"></span>[261](#fn_260.md) to flesh, (it is
impiety  <span id="fr_261"></span>[262](#fn_261) to imagine this,.md) but
continuing what it is, It so took upon It the form of a servant.

<span id="iv.xiii-p26"></span> \[2.\] Wherefore then does he use the
expression, “was made”? To stop the mouths of the heretics. For since
there are some  <span id="fr_262"></span>[263](#fn_262.md) who say that all
the circumstances of the Dispensation were an appearance, a piece of
acting, an allegory, at once to remove beforehand their blasphemy, he
has put “was made”; desiring to show thereby not a change of substance,
(away with the thought,) but the assumption of very flesh. For as when
(Paul) says, “Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being
made a curse for us,” he does not mean that His essence removing from
Its proper glory took upon It the being  <span
id="fr_263"></span>[264](#fn_263.md) of an accursed thing, (this not even
devils could imagine, nor even the very foolish, nor those deprived of
their natural understanding, such impiety as well as madness does it
contain,) as (St. Paul) does not say this, but that He, taking upon
Himself the curse pronounced against us, leaves us no more under the
curse; so also here he (St. John) says that He “was made Flesh,” not by
changing His Essence to flesh, but by taking flesh to Himself, His
Essence remained untouched.

<span id="iv.xiii-p29"></span> If they say that being God, He is
Omnipotent, so that He could lower Himself  <span
id="fr_264"></span>[265](#fn_264.md) to the substance of flesh, we will
reply to them, that He is Omnipotent as long as He continues to be God.
But if He admit of change, change for the worse, how could He be God?
for change is far from that simple Nature. Wherefore the Prophet saith,
“They all shall wax old as doth a garment, and as a vesture shalt Thou
roll them up, and they shall be changed; but Thou art the same, and Thy
years shall not fail.” ( [Ps. cii. 27](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#027.md)
<span id="iv.xiii-p30.2"></span> , LXX.) For that Essence is superior to
all change. There is nothing better than He, to which He might advance
and reach. Better do I say? No, nor equal to, nor the least approaching
Him. It remains, therefore, that if He change, He must admit a change
for the worse; and this would not be God. But let the blasphemy return
upon the heads of those who utter it. Nay, to show that he uses the
expression,’“ was made” only that you should not suppose a mere
appearance, hear from what follows how he clears the argument, and
overthrows that wicked suggestion. For what does he add? “And dwelt
among us.” All but saying, “Imagine nothing improper from the word ‘was
made’; I spoke not of any change of that unchangeable Nature, but of Its
dwelling  <span id="fr_265"></span>[266](#fn_265.md) and inhabiting. But
that which dwells  <span id="fr_266"></span>[267](#fn_266.md) cannot be the
same with that in which it dwells, but different; one thing dwells in a
different thing, otherwise it would not be dwelling; for nothing can
inhabit itself. I mean, different as to essence; for by an Union  <span
id="fr_267"></span>[268](#fn_267.md) and Conjoining  <span
id="fr_268"></span>[269](#fn_268.md) God the Word and the Flesh are One,
not by any confusion or obliteration of substances, but by a certain
union ineffable, and past  <span id="fr_269"></span>[270](#fn_269.md)
understanding. Ask not how  <span id="fr_270"></span>[271](#fn_270.md) ;
for It <span class="c11"><span id="iv.xiii-p36.1"></span>was made</span>
, so as He knoweth.”

<span id="iv.xiii-p37"></span>What then was the tabernacle in which He
dwelt? Hear the Prophet say; “I will raise up the tabernacle of David
that is fallen.” ( [Amos ix. 11](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#011.md) <span
id="iv.xiii-p37.1"></span> .) It was fallen indeed, our nature had
fallen an incurable fall, and needed only that mighty Hand. There was no
possibility of raising it again, had not He who fashioned it at first
stretched forth to it His Hand, and stamped it anew with His Image, by
the regeneration of water and the Spirit. And observe I pray you, the
awful and ineffable nature  <span id="fr_271"></span>[272](#fn_271.md) of
the mystery. He inhabits this tabernacle for ever, for He clothed
Himself with our flesh, not as again to leave it, but always to have it
with Him. Had not this been the case, He would not have deemed it worthy
of the royal throne, nor would He while wearing it have been worshiped
by all the host of heaven, angels, archangels, thrones, principalities,
dominions, powers. What word, what thought can represent such great
honor done to our race, so truly marvelous and awful? What angel, what
archangel? Not one in any place, whether in heaven, or upon earth. For
such are the mighty works  <span id="fr_272"></span>[273](#fn_272.md) of
God, so great and marvelous are His benefits, that a right description
of them exceeds not only the tongue of men, but even the power of
angels.

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span> <span id="iv.xiii-Page_39"></span>

<span id="iv.xiii-p40"></span> Wherefore we will  <span
id="fr_273"></span>[274](#fn_273.md) for a while close our discourse, and
be silent; only delivering to you this charge,  <span
id="fr_274"></span>[275](#fn_274.md) that you repay this our so great
Benefactor by a return which again shall bring round to us all profit.
The return is, that we look with all carefulness to the state of our
souls. For this too is the work of His lovingkindness, that He who
stands in no need of anything of ours says that He is repaid when we
take care of our own souls. It is therefore an act of extremist folly,
and one deserving ten thousand chastisements, if we, when such honor has
been lavished upon us, will not even contribute what we can, and that
too when profit comes round to us again by these means, and ten thousand
blessings are laid before us on these conditions. For all these things
let us return  <span id="fr_275"></span>[276](#fn_275.md) glory to our
merciful God, not by words only, but much more by works that we may
obtain the good things hereafter, which may it be that we all attain to,
through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom
and with whom, to the Father and the Holy Ghost, be glory for ever and
ever. Amen.
