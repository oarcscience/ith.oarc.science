<span id="iv.xviii-p1"></span> <span class="c15"><span

<span id="iv.xviii-p2"></span> <span id="iv.xviii-p2.1"></span> <span
class="c1"><span id="iv.xviii-p2.2"></span>[John i.
19](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#019.md)<span
id="iv.xviii-p2.3"></span></span>

<span id="iv.xviii-p3"></span>“And this is the record of John, when the
Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou?”

<span id="iv.xviii-p4"></span> \[1.\] <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.xviii-p4.1"></span>A dreadful</span> thing is envy, beloved, a
dreadful thing and a pernicious, to the enviers, not to the envied. For
it harms and wastes them first, like some mortal venom deeply seated in
their souls; and if by chance it injure its objects, the harm it does is
small and trifling, and such as brings greater gain than loss. Indeed
not in the case of envy only, but in every other, it is not he that has
suffered, but he that has done the wrong, who receives injury. For had
not this been so, Paul would not have enjoined the disciples rather to
endure wrong than to inflict it, when he says, “Why do ye not rather
take wrong? Why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?” (
[1 Cor. vi. 7](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#007.md) <span
id="iv.xviii-p4.2"></span> .) Well he knew, that destruction ever
follows, not the injured party, but the injuring. All this I have said,
by reason of the envy of the Jews. Because those who had flocked from
the cities to John, and had condemned their own sins, and caused
themselves to be baptized, repenting as it were after Baptism, send to
ask him, “Who art thou?” Of a truth they were the offspring of vipers,
serpents, and even worse if possible than this. O evil and adulterous
and perverse generation, after having been baptized, do ye then become
vainly curious, and question about the Baptist? What folly can be
greater than this of yours? How was it that ye came forth? that ye
confessed your sins, that ye ran to the Baptist? How was it that you
asked him what you must do? when in all <span id="page_54">p. 54</span>
<span id="iv.xviii-Page_54"></span> this you were acting unreasonably,
since you knew not the principle and purpose of his coming. Yet of this
the blessed John said nothing, nor does he charge or reproach them with
it, but answers them with all gentleness.

<span id="iv.xviii-p5"></span>It is worth while to learn why he did
thus. It was, that their wickedness might be manifest and plain to all
men. Often did John testify of Christ to the Jews, and when he baptized
them he continually made mention of Him to his company, and said, “I
indeed baptize you with water, but there cometh One after me who is
mightier than I; He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with
fire.” ( [Matt. iii. 11](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#011.md) <span
id="iv.xviii-p5.1"></span> .) With regard to him they were affected by a
human feeling; for, tremblingly attentive  <span
id="fr_424"></span>[425](#fn_424.md) to the opinion of the world, and
looking to “the outward appearance” ( [2 Cor. x.
7](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#007) <span id="iv.xviii-p6.2"></span> .md),
they deemed it an unworthy thing that he should be subject to Christ.
Since there were many things that pointed out John for an illustrious
person. In the first place, his distinguished and noble descent; for he
was the son of a chief priest. Then his conversation, his austere mode
of life, his contempt of all human things; for despising dress and
table, and house and food itself, he had passed his former time in the
desert. In the case of Christ all was the contrary of this. His family
was mean, (as they often objected to Him, saying, “Is not this the
carpenter’s son? Is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren James
and Joses?”) ( [Matt. xiii. 55](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#055.md) <span
id="iv.xviii-p6.3"></span> ); and that which was supposed to be His
country was held in such evil repute, that even Nathanael said, “Can
there any good thing come out of Nazareth?” ( [John
1.46](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#046.md)<span id="iv.xviii-p6.4"></span>
.) His mode of living was ordinary, and His garments not better than
those of the many. For He was not girt with a leathern girdle, nor was
His raiment of hair, nor did He eat honey and locusts. But He fared like
all others, and was present at the feasts of wicked men and publicans,
that He might draw them to Him. Which thing the Jews not understanding
reproached Him with, as He also saith Himself, “The Son of Man came
eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a gluttonous man and a
winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners.” ( [Matt. xi.
19](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#019) <span id="iv.xviii-p6.5"></span> ..md)
When then John continually sent them from himself to Jesus, who seemed
to them a meaner person, being ashamed and vexed at this, and wishing
rather to have him for their teacher, they did not dare to say so
plainly, but send to him, thinking by their flattery to induce him to
confess that he was the Christ. They do not therefore send to him mean
men, as in the case of Christ, for when they wished to lay hold on Him,
they sent servants, and then Herodians, and the like, but in this
instance, “priests and Levites,” and not merely “priests,” but those
“from Jerusalem,” that is, the more honorable; for the Evangelist did
not notice this without a cause. And they send to ask, “Who art thou?”
Yet the manner of his birth was well known to all, so that all said,
“What manner of child shall this be?” ( [Luke i.
66](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#066) <span id="iv.xviii-p6.6"></span> .md);
and the report had gone forth into all the hill country. And afterwards
when he came to Jordan, all the cities were set on the wing, and came to
him from Jerusalem, and from all Judæa, to be baptized. Why then do they
 <span id="fr_425"></span>[426](#fn_425.md) now ask? Not because they did
not know him, (how could that be, when he had been made manifest in so
many ways?) but because they wished to bring him to do that which I have
mentioned.

<span id="iv.xviii-p8"></span>\[2.\] Hear then how this blessed person
answered to the intention with which they asked the question, not to the
question itself. When they said, “Who art thou?” he did not at once give
them what would have been the direct answer, “I am the voice of one
crying in the wilderness.” But what did he? He removed the suspicion
they had formed; for, saith the Evangelist, being asked, “Who art thou?”

<span id="iv.xviii-p9"></span> [John
1.20](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#020.md)<span id="iv.xviii-p9.1"></span> .
“He confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ.”

<span id="iv.xviii-p10"></span> Observe the wisdom of the Evangelist. He
mentions this for the third time, to set forth the excellency of the
Baptist, and their wickedness and folly. And Luke also says, that when
the multitudes supposed him to be the Christ, he again removes their
suspicion.  <span id="fr_426"></span>[427](#fn_426.md) This is the part of
an honest servant, not only not to take to himself his master’s honor,
but also to reject it  <span id="fr_427"></span>[428](#fn_427.md) when
given to him by the many. But the multitudes arrived at this supposition
from simplicity and ignorance; these questioned him from an ill
intention, which I have mentioned, expecting, as I said, to draw him
over to their purpose by their flattery. Had they not expected this,
they would not have proceeded immediately to another question, but would
have been angry with him for having given them an answer foreign to
their enquiry, and would have said, “Why, did we suppose that? did we
come to ask thee that?” But now as taken and detected in the fact, they
proceed to another question, and say,

<span id="iv.xviii-p13"></span> [John
1.21](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#021.md)<span id="iv.xviii-p13.1"></span>
. “What then? art thou Elias? And he saith, I am not.”

<span id="iv.xviii-p14"></span>For they expected that Elias also would
come, as Christ declares; for when His disciples enquired, “How then do
the scribes say that Elias must first come?” ( [Matt. xvii.
10](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#010) <span id="iv.xviii-p14.1"></span> .md)
He replied, “Elias truly shall first come, and restore all <span
id="page_55">p. 55</span> <span id="iv.xviii-Page_55"></span> things.”
Then they ask, “Art thou that prophet? and he answered, No.” ( [Matt.
xvii. 10](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#010.md) <span
id="iv.xviii-p14.2"></span> .) Yet surely he was a prophet. Wherefore
then doth he deny it? Because again he looks to the intention of his
questioners. For they expected that some especial prophet should come,
because Moses said, “The Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet
of thy brethren like unto me, unto Him shall ye harken.” ( [Deut. xviii.
15](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#015.md) <span id="iv.xviii-p14.3"></span>
.) Now this was Christ. Wherefore they do not say, “Art thou a prophet?”
meaning thereby one of the ordinary prophets; but the expression, “Art
thou the prophet?” with the addition of the article, means, “Art thou
that Prophet who was foretold by Moses?” and therefore he denied not
that he was a prophet, but that he was “that Prophet.”

<span id="iv.xviii-p15"></span> [John
1.22](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#022.md)<span id="iv.xviii-p15.1"></span>
. “Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to
them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?”

<span id="iv.xviii-p16"></span>Observe them pressing him more
vehemently, urging him, repeating their questions, and not desisting;
while he first kindly removes false opinions concerning himself, and
then sets before them one which is true. For, saith he,

<span id="iv.xviii-p17"></span> [John
1.23](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#023.md)<span id="iv.xviii-p17.1"></span>
. “I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way
of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.”

<span id="iv.xviii-p18"></span>When he had spoken some high and lofty
words concerning Christ, as if (replying) to their opinion, he
immediately betook himself to the Prophet to draw from thence
confirmation of his assertion.

<span id="iv.xviii-p19"></span> [John
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#024.md),
[25](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#025.md)<span id="iv.xviii-p19.1"></span> .
“And \[saith the Evangelist\] they who were sent were of the Pharisees.
And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou
be not that Christ, neither Elias, neither that Prophet?”

<span id="iv.xviii-p20"></span> Seest thou not without reason I said
that they wished to bring him to this? and the reason why they did not
at first say so was, lest they should be detected by all men. And then
when he said, “I am not the Christ,” they, being desirous to conceal
what they were plotting  <span id="fr_428"></span>[429](#fn_428.md) within,
go on to “Elias,” and “that Prophet.” But when he said that he was not
one of these either, after that, in their perplexity, they cast aside
the mask, and without any disguise show clearly their treacherous
intention, saying, “Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that
Christ?” And then again, wishing to throw some obscurity over the thing,
 <span id="fr_429"></span>[430](#fn_429.md) they add the others also,
“Elias,” and “that Prophet.” For when they were not able to trip  <span
id="fr_430"></span>[431](#fn_430.md) him by their flattery, they thought
that by an accusation they could compel him  <span
id="fr_431"></span>[432](#fn_431.md) to say the thing that was not.

<span id="iv.xviii-p25"></span> What folly, what insolence, what
ill-timed officiousness! Ye were sent to learn who and whence he might
be, not to  <span id="fr_432"></span>[433](#fn_432.md) lay down laws for
him also. This too was the conduct of men who would compel him to
confess himself to be the Christ. Still not even now is he angry, nor
does he, as might have been expected, say to them anything of this sort,
“Do you give orders and make laws for me?” but again shows great
gentleness towards them.

<span id="iv.xviii-p27"></span> [John
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#026.md),
[27](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#027.md)<span id="iv.xviii-p27.1"></span> .
“I,” saith he, “baptize with water: but there standeth one among you,
whom ye know not; He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me,
whose shoe’s latchet I am not worthy to unloose.”

<span id="iv.xviii-p28"></span> \[3.\] What could the Jews have left to
say to this? for even from this the accusation against them cannot be
evaded, the decision against them admits not of pardon, they have given
sentence against themselves. How? In what way? They deemed John worthy
of credit, and so truthful, that they might believe him not only when he
testified of others, but also when he spoke concerning himself. For had
they not been so disposed, they would not have sent to learn from him
what related to himself. Because you know that the only persons whom we
believe, especially when speaking of themselves, are those whom we
suppose to be more veracious than any others. And it is not this alone
which closes their mouths, but also the disposition with which they had
approached him; for they came forth to him at first with great
eagerness, even though afterwards they altered. Both which things Christ
declared, when He said, “He was a burning (and a shining) light, and ye
were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.” Moreover, his answer
made him yet more worthy of credit. For (Christ) saith, “He that seeketh
not his own glory,  <span id="fr_433"></span>[434](#fn_433.md) the same is
true, and no unrighteousness is in him.” Now this man sought it not, but
refers the Jews to another. And those who were sent were of the most
trustworthy among them, and of the highest rank, so that they could have
in no way any refuge or excuse, for the unbelief which they exhibited
towards Christ. Wherefore did ye not receive the things spoken
concerning Him by John? you sent men who held the first rank among you,
you enquired by them, you heard what the Baptist answered, they
manifested all possible officiousness, sought into every point, named
all the persons you suspected him to be; and yet most publicly and
plainly he confessed that he was neither “Christ,” nor “Elias” nor “that
Prophet.” Nor did he stop even there, but also informed them who he was,
and spoke of the nature of his own baptism, that it was but a slight and
mean thing, nothing <span id="page_56">p. 56</span> <span
id="iv.xviii-Page_56"></span> more than some water, and told of the
superiority of the Baptism given by Christ; he also cited Esaias the
prophet, testifying of old very long ago, and calling Christ “Lord” (
[Isa. xl. 3](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#003.md) <span
id="iv.xviii-p29.2"></span> ), but giving him the names of “minister and
servant.” What after this ought they to have done? Ought they not to
have believed on Him who was witnessed of, to have worshiped Him, to
have confessed Him to be God? For the character and heavenly wisdom of
the witness showed that his testimony proceeded, not from flattery, but
from truth; which is plain also from this, that no man prefers his
neighbor to himself, nor, when he may lawfully give honor to himself,
will yield it up to another, especially when it is so great as that of
which we speak. So that John would not have renounced  <span
id="fr_434"></span>[435](#fn_434) this testimony (as belonging.md) to
Christ, had He not been God. For though he might have rejected it for
himself as being too great for his own nature, yet he would not have
assigned it to another nature that was beneath it.

<span id="iv.xviii-p31"></span> “But there standeth One among you, whom
ye know not.” Reasonable it was that Christ should mingle among the
people as one of the many, because everywhere He taught men not to be
puffed up and boastful. And in this place by “knowledge” the Baptist
means a perfect acquaintance with Him, who and whence He was.  And
immediately next to this he puts, “Who cometh after me”; all but saying,
“Think not that all is contained in my baptism, for had that been
perfect, Another would not have arisen after me to offer you a different
One, but this of mine is a preparation and a clearing the way for that
other. Mine is but a shadow and image, but One must come who shall add
to this the reality. So that His very coming ‘after me’ especially
declares His dignity: for had the first been perfect, no place would
have been required for a second.” “Is  <span
id="fr_435"></span>[436](#fn_435.md) before me,” is more honorable,
brighter. And then, lest they should imagine that His superiority was
found by comparison, desiring to establish His incomparableness, he
says, “Whose shoe’s latchet I am not worthy to unloose”; that is, who is
not simply “before me,” but before me in such a way, that I am not
worthy to be numbered among the meanest of His servants. For to loose
the shoe is the office of humblest service.

<span id="iv.xviii-p33"></span>Now if John was not worthy to “unloose
the latchet” ( [Matt. xi. 11](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#011.md) <span
id="iv.xviii-p33.1"></span> ), John, than whom “among them that are born
of women there hath not risen a greater,” where shall we rank ourselves?
If he who was equal to, or rather greater than, all the world,  <span
id="fr_436"></span>[437](#fn_436.md) (for saith Paul, “the world was not
worthy” of them— [Heb. xi. 38](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#038.md) <span
id="iv.xviii-p34.2"></span> ,) declares himself not worthy to be
reckoned even among the meanest of those who should minister unto Him,
what shall we say, who are full of ten thousand sins, and are as far
from the excellence of John, as earth from heaven.

<span id="iv.xviii-p35"></span> \[4.\] He then saith that he himself is
not “worthy so much as to unloose the latchet of His shoe”; while the
enemies of the truth are mad with such a madness, as to assert  <span
id="fr_437"></span>[438](#fn_437.md) that they are worthy to know Him even
as He knows Himself. What is worse than such insanity, what more
frenzied than such arrogance? Well hath a wise man said, “The beginning
of pride is not to know the Lord.”  <span
id="fr_438"></span>[439](#fn_438.md)

<span id="iv.xviii-p38"></span> The devil would not have been brought
down and become a devil, not being a devil before, had he not been sick
of this disease. This it was that cast him out from that confidence,
 <span id="fr_439"></span>[440](#fn_439.md) this sent him to the pit of
fire, this was the cause of all his woes. For it is enough of itself to
destroy every excellence of the soul, whether it find almsgiving, or
prayer, or fasting, or anything. For, saith the Evangelist, “That which
is highly esteemed among men is impure before the Lord.” ( [Luke xvi.
15](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#015.md) <span id="iv.xviii-p39.2"></span>
—not quoted exactly.) Therefore it is not only fornication or adultery
that are wont to defile those who practice them, but pride also, and
that far more than those vices. Why? Because fornication though it is an
unpardonable sin, yet a man may plead the desire; but pride cannot
possibly find any cause or pretext of any sort whatever by which to
obtain so much as a shadow of excuse; it is nothing but a distortion and
most grievous disease of the soul, produced from no other source but
folly. For there is nothing more foolish than a proud man, though he be
surrounded with wealth, though he possess much of the wisdom of this
world, though he be set in royal place, though he bear about with all
things that among men appear desirable.

<span id="iv.xviii-p40"></span>For if the man who is proud of things
really good is wretched and miserable, and loses the reward of all those
things, must not he who is exalted by things that are nought, and puffs
himself up because of a shadow or the flower of the grass, (for such is
this world’s glory,) be more ridiculous than any, when he does just as
some poor needy man might do, pining all his time with hunger, yet if
ever he should chance one night to see a dream of good fortune, filled
with conceit because of it?

<span id="iv.xviii-p41"></span>O wretched and miserable! when thy soul
is perishing by a most grievous disease, when thou art poor with utter
poverty, art thou high-minded because thou hast such and such a number
of talents of gold? because thou hast a multitude of slaves and cattle?
Yet these are not thine; <span id="page_57">p. 57</span> <span
id="iv.xviii-Page_57"></span> and if thou dost not believe my words,
learn from the experience of those who have gone before  <span
id="fr_440"></span>[441](#fn_440.md) thee. And if thou art so drunken, that
thou canst not be instructed even from what has befallen others, wait a
little, and thou shalt know by what befalls thyself that these things
avail thee nothing, when gasping for life, and master not of a single
hour, not even of a little moment, thou shalt unwillingly leave them
 <span id="fr_441"></span>[442](#fn_441.md) to those who are about thee,
and these perhaps those whom thou wouldest not. For many have not been
permitted even to give directions concerning them, but have departed
suddenly,  <span id="fr_442"></span>[443](#fn_442.md) desiring to enjoy
them, but not permitted, dragged from them, and forced to yield them up
to others, giving place by compulsion to those to whom they would not.
That this be not our case, let us, while we are yet in strength and
health, send forward our riches hence to our own city, for thus only and
in no other way shall we be able to enjoy them; so shall we lay them up
in a place inviolate and safe. For there is nothing, there is nothing
there that can take them from us; no death, no attested wills,  <span
id="fr_443"></span>[444](#fn_443.md) no successors to inheritances,  <span
id="fr_444"></span>[445](#fn_444.md) no false informations, no plottings
against us, but he who has departed hence bearing away great wealth with
him may enjoy it there for ever. Who then is so wretched as not to
desire to revel in riches which are his own throughout? Let us then
transfer our wealth, and remove it thither. We shall not need for such a
removal asses, or camels, or carriages, or ships, (God hath relieved
even us from this difficulty,) but we only want the poor, the lame, the
crippled, the infirm. These are entrusted with this transfer, these
convey our riches to heaven, these introduce the masters of such wealth
as this to the inheritance of goods everlasting. Which may it be that we
all attain through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus
Christ, by whom and with whom, to the Father and the Holy Ghost, be
glory, now and ever, and world without end. Amen.
