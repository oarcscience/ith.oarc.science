<span id="iv.xxii-p3"></span>“The day following Jesus would go forth
into Galilee and findeth Philip, and saith unto him, Follow Me. Now
Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.”

<span id="iv.xxii-p4"></span> \[1.\] “ <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.xxii-p4.1"></span>To</span> every careful thinker there is a
gain”  <span id="fr_521"></span>[522](#fn_521.md) ( [Prov. xiv.
23](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#023.md) <span id="iv.xxii-p5.7"></span> ,
LXX.), saith the proverb; and Christ implied more than this, when He
said, “He that seeketh findeth.” ( [Matt. vii.
8](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#008) <span id="iv.xxii-p5.8"></span> ..md)
Wherefore it does not occur to me any more to wonder how Philip followed
Christ. Andrew was persuaded when he had heard from John, and Peter the
same from Andrew, but Philip not having learned anything from any but
Christ who said to him only this, “Follow Me,” straightway obeyed, and
went not back, but even became a preacher to others. For he ran to
Nathanael and said to him, “We have found Him of whom Moses in the Law
and the Prophets did write.” Seest thou what a thoughtful  <span
id="fr_522"></span>[523](#fn_522.md) mind he had, how assiduously he
meditated on the writings of Moses, and expected the Advent? for the
expression, “we have found,” belongs <span id="page_69">p. 69</span>
<span id="iv.xxii-Page_69"></span> always to those who are in some way
seeking. “The day following Jesus went forth into Galilee.” Before any
had joined Him, He called no one; and He acted thus not without cause,
but according to his own wisdom and intelligence. For if, when no one
came to Him spontaneously, He had Himself drawn them, they might perhaps
have started away; but now, having chosen this of themselves, they
afterwards remained firm. He calls Philip, one who was better acquainted
with Him; for he, as having been born and bred in Galilee, knew Him more
than others. Having then taken the disciples, He next goes to the
capture of the others, and draws to Him Philip and Nathanael.  Now in
the case of Nathanael this was not so wonderful, because the fame of
Jesus had gone forth into all Syria. ( [Matt. iv.
24](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#024) <span id="iv.xxii-p6.2"></span> ..md)
But the wonderful thing was respecting Peter and James and Philip, that
they believed, not only before the miracles, but that they did so being
of Galilee, out of which “ariseth no prophet,” nor “can any good thing
come”; for the Galilæans were somehow of a more boorish and dull
disposition than others; but even in this Christ displayed forth His
power, by selecting from a land which bore no fruit His choicest
disciples. It is then probable that Philip having seen Peter and Andrew,
and having heard what John had said, followed; and it is probable also
that the voice of Christ wrought in him somewhat; for He knew those who
would be serviceable. But all these points the Evangelist cuts short.
That Christ should come, he knew; that this was Christ, he knew not, and
this I say that he heard either from Peter or John. But John mentions
his village also, that you may learn that “God hath chosen the weak
things of the world.” ( [1 Cor. i. 27](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#027.md)
<span id="iv.xxii-p6.3"></span> .)

<span id="iv.xxii-p7"></span> [John
1.45](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#045.md)<span id="iv.xxii-p7.1"></span> .
“Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found Him of whom
Moses in the Law and the Prophets did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son
of Joseph.”

<span id="iv.xxii-p8"></span> He says this, to make his preaching
credible, which it must be if it rests on Moses and the Prophets
besides, and by this to abash his hearer. For since Nathanael was an
exact  <span id="fr_523"></span>[524](#fn_523.md) man, and one who viewed
all things with truth, as Christ also testified and the event showed,
Philip with reason refers him to Moses and the Prophets, that so he
might receive Him who was preached. And he not troubled though he called
Him “the son of Joseph”; for still he was supposed to be his son. “And
whence, O Philip, is it plain that this is He? What proof dost thou
mention to us? for it is not enough merely to assert this. What sign
hast thou seen, what miracle? Not without danger is it to believe
without cause in such matters. What proof then hast thou?” “The same as
Andrew,” he replies; for he though unable to produce the wealth which he
had found, or to describe his treasure in words, when he had discovered
it, led his brother to it. So too did Philip. How this is the Christ,
and how the prophets proclaimed Him beforehand, he said not; but he
draws him to Jesus, as knowing that he would not afterwards fall off, if
he should once taste His words and teaching.

<span id="iv.xxii-p10"></span> [John
1:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#046.md),
[47](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#047.md)<span id="iv.xxii-p10.1"></span> .
 “And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of
Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see. Jesus saw Nathanael
coming to Him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is
no guile.”

<span id="iv.xxii-p11"></span> He praises and approves the man, because
he had said, “Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?” and yet he ought
to have been blamed. Surely not; for the words are not those of an
unbeliever, nor deserving blame, but praise. “How so, and in what way?”
Because Nathanael had considered the writings of the Prophets more than
Philip. For he had heard from the Scriptures, that Christ must come from
Bethlehem, and from the village in which David was.  This belief at
least prevailed among the Jews, and the Prophet had proclaimed it of
old, saying, “And thou, Bethlehem, art by no means the least among the
princes of Judah, for out of thee shall come a Governor, that shall feed
 <span id="fr_524"></span>[525](#fn_524.md) My people Israel.” ( [Matt.
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#006.md), [Mic.
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#002)<span id="iv.xxii-p12.1"></span> ..md)
And so when he heard that He was “from Nazareth,” he was confounded, and
doubted, not finding the announcement of Philip to agree with the
prediction of the Prophet.

<span id="iv.xxii-p13"></span>But observe his wisdom and candor even in
his doubting. He did not at once say, “Philip, thou deceivest me, and
speakest falsely, I believe thee not, I will not come; I have learned
from the prophets that Christ must come from Bethlehem, thou sayest
‘from Nazareth’; therefore this is not that Christ.” He said nothing
like this; but what does he? He goes to Him himself; showing, by not
admitting that Christ was “of Nazareth,” his accuracy respecting the
Scriptures, and a character not easily deceived; and by not rejecting
him who brought the tidings, the great desire which he felt for the
coming of Christ. For he thought within himself that Philip was probably
mistaken about the place.

<span id="iv.xxii-p14"></span> \[2.\] And observe, I pray you, his
manner of declining, how gentle he has made it, and in the form of a
question. For he said not, “Galilee produces no good”; but how said he?
“Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?” Philip also was very prudent;
for he is not as one perplexed, angry, and annoyed, but perseveres,
wishing to bring over the  <span id="fr_525"></span>[526](#fn_525.md) man,
and manifesting <span id="page_70">p. 70</span> <span
id="iv.xxii-Page_70"></span> to us from the first of his preaching
 <span id="fr_526"></span>[527](#fn_526.md) the firmness  <span
id="fr_527"></span>[528](#fn_527.md) which becomes an Apostle. Wherefore
also Christ saith, “Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile.” So
that there is such a person as a false Israelite; but this is not such
an one; for his judgment, Christ saith, is impartial, he speaks nothing
from favor, or from ill-feeling. Yet the Jews, when they were asked
where Christ should be born, replied, “In Bethlehem” ( [Matt. ii.
5](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#005) <span id="iv.xxii-p17.2"></span> .md),
and produced the evidence, saying, “And thou, Bethlehem, art by no means
the least among the princes of Judah.” ( [Mic. v.
2](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#002) <span id="iv.xxii-p17.3"></span> ..md)
Before they had seen Him they bore this witness, but when they saw Him
in their malice they concealed the testimony, saying, “But as for this
fellow, we know not whence He is.” ( [John
9.29](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#029.md)<span id="iv.xxii-p17.4"></span>
.) Nathanael did not so, but continued to retain the opinion which he
had from the beginning, that He was not “of Nazareth.”

<span id="iv.xxii-p18"></span>How then do the prophets call Him a
Nazarene? From His being brought up and abiding there. And He omits to
say, “I am not ‘of Nazareth,’ as Philip hath told thee, but of
Bethlehem,” that He may not at once make the account seem questionable;
and besides this, because, even if He had gained belief, He would not
have given sufficient proof that He was the Christ. For what hindered
Him without being Christ, from being of Bethlehem, like the others who
were born there? This then He omits; but He does that which has most
power to bring him over, for He shows that He was present when they were
conversing. For when Nathanael had said,

<span id="iv.xxii-p19"></span> [John
1.48](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#048.md)<span id="iv.xxii-p19.1"></span> .
“Whence knowest Thou me?” He replies, “Before that Philip called thee,
when thou wast under the fig-tree, I saw thee.”

<span id="iv.xxii-p20"></span> Observe a man firm and steady.  <span
id="fr_528"></span>[529](#fn_528.md) When Christ had said, “Behold an
Israelite indeed,” he was not made vain by this approbation, he ran not
after this open praise, but continues seeking and searching more
exactly, and desires to learn something certain. He still enquired as of
a man,  <span id="fr_529"></span>[530](#fn_529.md) but Jesus answered as
God. For He said, “I have known thee from the first,”  <span
id="fr_530"></span>[531](#fn_530.md) (him and the candor  <span
id="fr_531"></span>[532](#fn_531.md) of his character,  <span
id="fr_532"></span>[533](#fn_532.md) this He knew not as a man, from having
closely followed him, but as God from the first,) “and but now I saw
thee by the fig-tree”; when there was no one present there but only
Philip and Nathanael who said all these things in private. It is
mentioned, that having seen him afar off, He said, “Behold an Israelite
indeed”; to show,  <span id="fr_533"></span>[534](#fn_533.md) that before
Philip came near, Christ spoke these words, that the testimony might not
be suspected. For this reason also He named the time, the place, and the
tree; because if He had only said, “Before Philip came to thee, I saw
thee,” He might have been suspected of having sent him, and of saying
nothing wonderful; but now, by mentioning both the place where he was
when addressed by Philip, and the name of the tree, and the time of the
conversation, He showed that His foreknowledge  <span
id="fr_534"></span>[535](#fn_534.md) was unquestionable.

<span id="iv.xxii-p28"></span>And He did not merely show to him His
foreknowledge, but instructed him also in another way. For He brought
him to a recollection of what they then had said; as, “Can there any
good thing come out of Nazareth?” And it was most especially on this
account that Nathanael received Him, because when he had uttered these
words, He did not condemn, but praised and approved him. Therefore he
was assured that this was indeed the Christ, both from His
foreknowledge, and from His having exactly searched out his sentiments,
which was the act of One who would show that He knew what was in his
mind; and besides, from His not having blamed, but rather praised him
when he had seemed to speak against Himself. He said then, that Philip
had “called” him; but what Philip had said to him or he to Philip, He
omitted, leaving it to his own conscience, and not desiring farther to
rebuke him.

<span id="iv.xxii-p29"></span> \[3.\] Was it then only “before Philip
called him” that He “saw” him? did He not see him before this with His
sleepless eye? He saw him, and none could gainsay it; but this is what
it was needful to say at the time. And what did Nathanael? When he had
received an unquestionable proof of His foreknowledge, he hastened to
confess Him, showing by his previous delay his caution,  <span
id="fr_535"></span>[536](#fn_535.md) and his fairness by his assent
afterwards. For, said the Evangelist,

<span id="iv.xxii-p31"></span> [John
1.49](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#049.md)<span id="iv.xxii-p31.1"></span> .
“He answered and saith unto Him, Rabbi, Thou art the Son of God, Thou
art the King of Israel:”

<span id="iv.xxii-p32"></span>Seest thou how his soul is filled at once
with exceeding joy, and embraces Jesus with words? “Thou art,” saith he,
“that expected, that sought-for One.” Seest thou how he is amazed, how
he marvels? how he leaps and dances with delight?

<span id="iv.xxii-p33"></span>So ought we also to rejoice, who have been
thought worthy to know the Son of God; to rejoice, not in thought alone,
but to show it also by our actions. And what must they do who rejoice?
Obey Him who has been made known to them; and they who obey, must do
whatever He willeth. For if we are going to do what angers Him, how
shall we show that we rejoice? See ye not in our houses when a man
entertains <span id="page_71">p. 71</span> <span
id="iv.xxii-Page_71"></span> one whom he loves, how gladly he exerts
himself, running about in every direction, and though it be needful to
spend all that he has, sparing nothing so that he please his visitor?
But if one who invites should not attend to his guest,  <span
id="fr_536"></span>[537](#fn_536.md) and not do such things as would
procure him ease, though he should say ten thousand times that he
rejoices at his coming, he could never be believed by him. And justly;
for this should be shown by actions. Let us then, since Christ hath come
to us, show that we rejoice, and do nothing that may anger him; let us
garnish the abode to which He has come, for this they do who rejoice;
let us set before Him the meal  <span id="fr_537"></span>[538](#fn_537.md)
which He desires to eat, for this they do who hold festival. And what is
this meal? He saith Himself; “My meat is, that I may do the will of Him
that sent me.” ( [John 4.34](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#034.md)<span
id="iv.xxii-p35.3"></span> .) When He is hungry, let us feed Him; when
He is thirsty, let us give Him drink: though thou give Him but a cup of
cold water, He receives it; for He loves thee, and to one who loves, the
offerings of the beloved, though they be small, appear great. Only be
not thou slothful; though thou cast in but two farthings, He refuses
them not, but receives them as great riches. For since He is without
wants, and receives these offerings, not because He needs them, it is
reasonable that all distinction should be not in the quantity of the
gifts, but the intention  <span id="fr_538"></span>[539](#fn_538.md) of the
giver. Only show that thou lovest Him who is come, that for His sake
thou art giving all diligence, that thou rejoicest at His coming. See
how He is disposed toward thee. He came for thee, He laid down His life
for thee, and after all this He doth not refuse even to entreat thee.
“We are ambassadors,” saith Paul, “for Christ, as though God did beseech
you by us.” ( [2 Cor. v. 20](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#020.md) <span
id="iv.xxii-p36.2"></span> .) “And who is so mad,” saith some one, “as
not to love his own Master?” I say so too, and I know that not one of us
would deny this in words or intention; but one who is beloved desires
love to be shown, not by words only, but by deeds also. For to say that
we love, and not to act like lovers, is ridiculous, not only before God,
but even in the sight of men. Since then to confess Him in word only,
while in deeds we oppose Him, is not only unprofitable, but also hurtful
to us; let us, I entreat you, also make confession by our works; that we
also may obtain a confession from Him in that day, when before His
Father He shall confess those who are worthy in Christ Jesus our Lord,
by whom and with whom, to the Father and the Holy Ghost be glory, now
and ever, and world without end. Amen.
