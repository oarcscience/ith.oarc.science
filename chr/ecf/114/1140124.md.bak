<span id="v.xxx-p1"></span> <span class="c15"><span
id="v.xxx-p1.1"></span>Homily XXVI.</span>

<span id="v.xxx-p2"></span> <span id="v.xxx-p2.1"></span> <span
class="c1"><span id="v.xxx-p2.2"></span>[Hebrews xi.
20-22](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#020.md)<span
id="v.xxx-p2.3"></span></span>

<span id="v.xxx-p3"></span> “By faith, Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau
concerning things to come. By faith, Jacob when he was a dying blessed
both the sons of Joseph, and worshiped  <span
id="fr_3280"></span>[3281](#fn_3280.md) leaning on the top of his staff. By
faith, Joseph when he died made mention of the departing of the children
of Israel, and gave commandment concerning his bones.”

<span id="v.xxx-p5"></span> \[1.\] “ <span class="c11"><span
id="v.xxx-p5.1"></span>Many</span> prophets and righteous men” (it is
said) “have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen
them; and to hear those things which ye hear and have not heard them.” (
[Matt. xiii. 17](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#017.md) <span
id="v.xxx-p5.2"></span> .) Did then those righteous men know all the
things to come? Yea, most certainly. For if because of the weakness of
those who were not able to receive Him, the Son was not revealed,—He was
with good reason revealed to those conspicuous in virtue. This Paul also
says, that they knew “the things to come,” that is the resurrection of
Christ.

<span id="v.xxx-p6"></span>Or he does not mean this: but that “By faith,
concerning things to come” \[means\] not \[concerning\] the world to
come, but “concerning things to come” in this world. For how \[except by
faith\] could a man sojourning in a strange land, give such blessings?

<span id="page_482">p. 482</span> <span id="v.xxx-Page_482"></span>

<span id="v.xxx-p7"></span> But on the other hand he obtained the
blessing, and yet did not receive it.  <span
id="fr_3281"></span>[3282](#fn_3281.md) Thou seest that what I said with
regard to Abraham, may be said also of Jacob, that they did not enjoy
 <span id="fr_3282"></span>[3283](#fn_3282.md) the blessing, but the
blessings went to his posterity, while he himself obtained the “things
to come.” For we find that his brother rather enjoyed the blessing. For
\[Jacob\] spent all his time in servitude and working as a hireling, and
\[amid\] dangers, and plots, and deceits, and fears; and when he was
asked by Pharaoh, he says, “Few and evil have my days been” ( [Gen.
xlvii. 9](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#009.md) <span id="v.xxx-p9.9"></span>
); while the other lived in independence and great security, and
afterwards was an object of terror to \[Jacob\]. Where then did the
blessings come to their accomplishment, save in the \[world\] to come?

<span id="v.xxx-p10"></span>Seest thou that from the beginning the
wicked have enjoyed things here, but the righteous the contrary? Not
however all. For behold, Abraham was a righteous man, and he enjoyed
things here as well, though with affliction and trials. For indeed
wealth was all he had, seeing all else relating to him was full of
affliction. For it is impossible that the righteous man should not be
afflicted, though he be rich: for when he is willing to be overreached,
to be wronged, to suffer all other things, he must be afflicted. So that
although he enjoy wealth, \[yet is it\] not without grief. Why? you ask.
Because he is in affliction and distress. But if at that time the
righteous were in affliction, much more now.

<span id="v.xxx-p11"></span>“By Faith,” he says, “Isaac blessed Jacob
and Esau concerning things to come” (and yet Esau was the elder; but he
puts Jacob first for his excellence). Seest thou how great was his
Faith? Whence did he promise to his sons so great blessings? Entirely
from his having faith in God.

<span id="v.xxx-p12"></span> \[2.\] “By Faith, Jacob when he was a
dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph.” Here we ought to set down the
blessings entire, in order that both his faith and his prophesying may
be made manifest. “And worshiped leaning,”  <span
id="fr_3283"></span>[3284](#fn_3283.md) he says, “upon the top of his
staff.” Here, he means, he not only spoke, but was even so confident
about the future things, as to show it also by his act. For inasmuch as
another King was about to arise from Ephraim, therefore it is said, “And
he bowed himself upon the top of his staff.” That is, even though he was
now an old man, “he bowed himself” to Joseph, showing the obeisance of
the whole people which was to be \[directed\] to him. And this indeed
had already taken place, when his brethren “bowed down” to him: but it
was afterwards to come to pass through the ten tribes. Seest thou how he
foretold the things which were to be afterwards? Seest thou how great
faith they had? How they believed “concerning the things to come”?

<span id="v.xxx-p14"></span> For some of the things here, the things
present, are examples of patience only, and of enduring ill-treatment,
and of receiving nothing good; for instance, what is mentioned in the
case of Abraham, in the case of Abel. But others are \[examples\] of
Faith, as in the case of Noah, that there is a God, that there is a
recompense. (For Faith in this place is manifold,  <span
id="fr_3284"></span>[3285](#fn_3284.md) both of there being a recompense,
and of awaiting it, not under the same conditions,  <span
id="fr_3285"></span>[3286](#fn_3285.md) and of wrestling before the
prizes.) And the things also which concern  <span
id="fr_3286"></span>[3287](#fn_3286.md) Joseph are of Faith only. Joseph
heard that \[God\] had made a promise to Abraham, that He had engaged
His word “to thee and to thy seed will I give this land;” and though in
a strange land, and not yet seeing the engagement fulfilled, but never
faltered even so, but so believed as even to “speak of the Exodus, and
to give commandment concerning his bones.” He then not only believed
himself, but led on the rest also to Faith: that having the Exodus
always in mind (for he would not have “given commandment concerning his
bones,” unless he had been fully assured \[of this\]), they might look
for their return \[to Canaan\].

<span id="v.xxx-p18"></span> Wherefore, when some men say, ‘See! Even
righteous men had care about their sepulchers,’ let us reply to them,
that it was for his reason: for he knew that “the earth is the Lord’s
and all that therein is.”  <span id="fr_3287"></span>[3288](#fn_3287.md) (
[Ps. xxiv. 1](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#001.md) <span
id="v.xxx-p19.2"></span> .) He could not indeed have been ignorant of
this, who lived in so great philosophy, who spent his whole life in
Egypt. And yet if he had wished, it was possible for him to return, and
not to mourn or vex himself. But when he had taken up his father
thither, why, did he enjoin them to carry up thence his own bones also?
Evidently for this reason.

<span id="v.xxx-p20"></span> But what? Tell me, are not the bones of
Moses himself laid in a strange land? And those of Aaron, of Daniel, of
Jeremiah? And as to those of the Apostles we do not know where those of
most of them are laid. For of Peter indeed, and Paul, and John, and
Thomas, the sepulchers are well known; but those of the rest, being so
many, have nowhere become known.  <span
id="fr_3288"></span>[3289](#fn_3288.md) Let us not therefore lament at all
about this, nor be so little-minded. For whereever we may be buried,
“the earth is the Lord’s <span id="page_483">p. 483</span> <span
id="v.xxx-Page_483"></span> and all that therein is.” ( [Ps. xxiv.
1](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#001) <span id="v.xxx-p21.2"></span> ..md)
Certainly what must take place, does take place: to mourn however, and
lament, and bewail the departed, arises from littleness of mind.

<span id="v.xxx-p22"></span>\[3.\] ( [Heb.
11.23](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#023)<span id="v.xxx-p22.1"></span> .md)
“By faith, Moses when he was born, was hid three months of his parents.”
Dost thou see that in this case they hoped for things on the earth after
their death?  <span id="fr_3289"></span>[3290](#fn_3289.md) And many things
were fulfilled after their death. This is for some who say, ‘After death
those things were done for them, which they did not obtain while alive;
nor did they believe \[would be\] after their death.’

<span id="v.xxx-p24"></span>Moreover Joseph did not say, He gave not the
land to me in my life-time, nor to my father, nor to my grandfather,
whose excellence too ought to have been reverenced; and will He
vouchsafe to these wretched people what He did not vouchsafe to them? He
said nothing of all this, but by Faith he both conquered and went beyond
all these things.

<span id="v.xxx-p25"></span>He has named Abel, Noah, Abraham, Isaac,
Jacob, Joseph, all illustrious and admirable men. Again he makes the
encouragement greater, by bringing down the matter to ordinary persons.
For that the admirable should feel thus, is nothing wonderful, and to
appear inferior to them, is not so dreadful: but to show oneself
inferior even to people without names, this is the dreadful thing. And
he begins with the parents of Moses, obscure persons, who had nothing so
great as their son \[had\]. Therefore also he goes on to increase the
strangeness of what he says by enumerating even women that were harlots,
and widows. For “by Faith” (he says) “the harlot Rahab perished not with
them that believed not, when she had received the spies with peace.” And
he mentions the rewards not only of belief but also of unbelief; as in
\[the case of\] Noah.

<span id="v.xxx-p26"></span>But at present we must speak of the parents
of Moses. Pharaoh gave orders that all the male children should be
destroyed, and none had escaped the danger. Whence did these expect to
save their child? From faith. What sort of Faith? “They saw” (he says)
“that he was a proper child.” The very sight drew them on to Faith: thus
from the beginning, yea from the very swaddling-clothes, great was the
Grace that was poured out on that righteous man, this being not the work
of nature. For observe, the child immediately on its birth appears fair
and not disagreeable to the sight. Whose \[work\] was this? Not that of
nature, but of the Grace of God, which also stirred up and strengthened
that barbarian woman, the Egyptian, and took and drew her on.

<span id="v.xxx-p27"></span>And yet in truth Faith had not a sufficient
foundation in their case. For what was it to believe from sight? But you
(he would say) believe from facts and have many pledges of Faith. For
“the receiving with joyfulness the spoiling of their goods” ( [Heb.
10.34](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#034)<span id="v.xxx-p27.1"></span> .md),
and other such \[things\], were \[evidences\] of Faith and of Patience.
But inasmuch as these \[Hebrews\] also had believed, and yet afterwards
had become faint-hearted, he shows that the Faith of those \[saints of
old\] also was long continued,  <span
id="fr_3290"></span>[3291](#fn_3290.md) as, for instance, that of Abraham,
although the circumstances seemed to contend against it.

<span id="v.xxx-p29"></span> “And” (he says) “they were not afraid of
the king’s commandment,” although that was in operation,  <span
id="fr_3291"></span>[3292](#fn_3291.md) but this \[their hope respecting
their child\] was simply a kind of bare expectation. And this indeed was
\[the act\] of his parents; but Moses himself what did he contribute?

<span id="v.xxx-p31"></span>\[4.\] Next again an example appropriate to
them, or rather greater than that. For, saith he, ( [Heb.
11.24-26](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#024.md)<span id="v.xxx-p31.1"></span>
) “by faith Moses when he was come to years, refused to be called the
son of Pharaoh’s daughter, choosing rather to suffer affliction with the
people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season; esteeming
the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt;
 <span id="fr_3292"></span>[3293](#fn_3292.md) for he had respect unto the
recompense of the reward.” As though he had said to them, ‘No one of you
has left a palace, yea a splendid palace, nor such treasures; nor, when
he might have been a king’s son, has he despised this, as Moses did.’
And that he did not simply leave \[these things\], he expressed by
saying, “he refused,” that is, he hated, he turned away. For when Heaven
was set before him, it was superfluous to admire an Egyptian Palace.

<span id="v.xxx-p33"></span>And see how admirably Paul has put it. He
did not say, ‘Esteeming heaven, and the things in heaven,’ ‘greater
riches than the treasures of Egypt,’ but what? “The reproach of Christ.”
For the being reproached for the sake of Christ he accounted better than
being thus at ease; and this itself by itself was reward.

<span id="v.xxx-p34"></span>“Choosing rather” (he says) “to suffer
affliction with the people of God.” For ye indeed suffer on your own
account, but he “chose” \[to suffer\] for others; and voluntarily threw
himself into so many dangers, when it was in his power both to live
religiously, and to enjoy good things.

<span id="v.xxx-p35"></span>“Than” (he says) “to enjoy the pleasures of
sin for a season.” He called unwillingness “to <span id="page_484">p.
484</span> <span id="v.xxx-Page_484"></span> suffer affliction with the”
rest “sin”: this, he says, \[Moses\] accounted to be “sin.” If then he
accounted it “sin” not to be ready to “suffer affliction with” the rest,
it follows that the suffering affliction must be a great good since he
threw himself into it from the royal palace.

<span id="v.xxx-p36"></span> But this he did, seeing some great things
before him. “Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the
treasures of Egypt.” What is, “the reproach of Christ”? It is being
reproached in such ways as ye are, the reproach which Christ endured; Or
that he endured for Christ’s sake: for “that rock was Christ”  <span
id="fr_3293"></span>[3294](#fn_3293.md) ( [1 Cor. x.
4](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#004) <span id="v.xxx-p37.8"></span> .md);
the being reproached as you are.

<span id="v.xxx-p38"></span>But what is “the reproach of Christ”? That
\[because\] we repudiate the \[ways\] of our fathers we are reproached;
that we are evil-entreated when we have run to God. It was likely that
he also was reproached, when it was said to him, “Wilt thou kill me as
thou killedst the Egyptian yesterday?” ( [Ex. ii.
14](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#014) <span id="v.xxx-p38.1"></span> ..md)
This is “the reproach of Christ,” to be ill-treated to the end, and to
the last breath: as He Himself was reproached and heard, “If Thou be the
Son of God” ( [Matt. xxvii. 40](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#040.md) <span
id="v.xxx-p38.2"></span> ), from those for whom He was crucified, from
those who were of the same race. This is “the reproach of Christ” when a
man is reproached by those of his own family, or by those whom he is
benefiting. For \[Moses\] also suffered these things from the man who
had been benefited \[by him\].

<span id="v.xxx-p39"></span>In these words he encouraged them, by
showing that even Christ suffered these things, and Moses also, two
illustrious persons. So that this is rather “the reproach of Christ”
than of Moses inasmuch as He suffered these things from “His own.” (
[John i. 11](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#011.md) <span
id="v.xxx-p39.1"></span> .) But neither did the one send forth
lightnings, nor the Other feel any \[anger\],  <span
id="fr_3294"></span>[3295](#fn_3294.md) but He was reviled and endured all
things, whilst they “wagged their heads.” ( [Matt. xxvii.
39](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#039) <span id="v.xxx-p40.3"></span> ..md)
Since therefore it was probable that they \[the readers\] also would
hear such things, and would long for the Recompense, he says that even
Christ and Moses had suffered the like. So then ease  <span
id="fr_3295"></span>[3296](#fn_3295.md) is \[the portion\] of sin; but to
be reproached, of Christ. For what then dost thou wish? “The reproach of
Christ,” or ease?

<span id="v.xxx-p42"></span>\[5.\] ( [Heb.
11.27](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#027)<span id="v.xxx-p42.1"></span> .md)
“By faith he forsook Egypt not fearing the wrath of the king; for he
endured as seeing Him who is Invisible.” What dost thou say? That he did
not fear? And yet the Scripture says, that when he heard, he “was
afraid”  <span id="fr_3296"></span>[3297](#fn_3296.md) ( [Ex. ii.
14](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#014) <span id="v.xxx-p43.6"></span> .md),
and for this cause provided for safety by flight, and stole away, and
secretly withdrew himself; and afterwards he was exceedingly afraid.
Observe the expressions with care: he said, “not fearing the wrath of
the king,” with reference to his even presenting himself again. For it
would have been \[the part\] of one who was afraid, not to undertake
again his championship, nor to have any hand in the matter. That he did
however again undertake it, was \[the part\] of one who committed all to
God: for he did not say, ‘He is seeking me, and is busy \[in the
search\], and I cannot bear again to engage in this matter.’

<span id="v.xxx-p44"></span>So that even flight was \[an act of\] faith.
Why then did he not remain (you say)? That he might not cast himself
into a foreseen danger. For this finally would have been tempting
\[God\]: to leap into the midst of dangers, and say, ‘Let us see whether
God will save me.’ And this the devil said to Christ, “Cast Thyself
down.” ( [Matt. iv. 6](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#006.md) <span
id="v.xxx-p44.1"></span> .) Seest thou that it is a diabolical thing, to
throw ourselves into danger without cause and for no purpose, and to try
whether God will save us? For he \[Moses\] could no longer be their
champion when they who were receiving benefits were so ungrateful. It
would therefore have been a foolish and senseless thing to remain there.
But all these things were done, because, “he endured as seeing Him who
is Invisible.”

<span id="v.xxx-p45"></span>\[6.\] If then we too always see God with
our mind, if we always think in remembrance of Him, all things will
appear endurable to us, all things tolerable; we shall bear them all
easily, we shall be above them all. For if a person seeing one whom he
loves, or rather, remembering him is roused in spirit, and elevated in
thought, and bears all things easily, while he delights in the
remembrance; one who has in mind Him who has vouchsafed to love us in
deed, and remembers Him, when will he either feel anything painful, or
dread anything fearful or dangerous? When will he be of cowardly spirit?
Never.

<span id="v.xxx-p46"></span>For all things appear to us difficult,
because we do not have the remembrance of God as we ought; because we do
not carry Him about alway in our thoughts. For surely He might justly
say to us, “Thou hast forgotten Me, I also will forget thee.” And so the
evil becomes twofold, both that we forget Him and He us. For these two
things are involved in each other, yet are two. For great is the effect
of God’s remembrance, and great also of His being remembered by us. The
result of the one is that we choose good things; of the other that we
<span id="page_485">p. 485</span> <span id="v.xxx-Page_485"></span>
accomplish them, and bring them to their end.  <span
id="fr_3297"></span>[3298](#fn_3297.md) Therefore the prophet says, “I will
remember Thee from the land of Jordan, and from the little hill of
Hermon.” ( [Ps. xlii. 6](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#006.md) <span
id="v.xxx-p47.3"></span> .) The people which were in Babylon say this:
being there, I will remember Thee.

<span id="v.xxx-p48"></span>\[7.\] Therefore let us also, as being in
Babylon, \[do the same\]. For although we are not sitting among warlike
foes, yet we are among enemies. For some \[of them\] indeed were sitting
as captives, but others did not even feel their captivity, as Daniel, as
the three children (cf. [Ps. cxxxvii.
1](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#001) <span id="v.xxx-p48.1"></span> .md);
who even while they were in captivity became in that very country more
glorious even than the king who had carried them captive. And he who had
taken them captive does obeisance to  <span
id="fr_3298"></span>[3299](#fn_3298.md) the captives.

<span id="v.xxx-p50"></span> Dost thou see how great virtue is? When
they were in actual captivity he waited on them as masters. He therefore
was the captive, rather than they. It would not have been so marvelous
if when they were in their native country, he had come and done them
reverence in their own land, or if they had been rulers there. But the
marvelous thing is, that after he had bound them, and taken them
captive, and had them in his own country, he was not ashamed to do them
reverence in the sight of all, and to “offer an oblation.”  <span
id="fr_3299"></span>[3300](#fn_3299.md) ( [Dan. ii.
46](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#046) <span id="v.xxx-p51.11"></span> ..md)

<span id="v.xxx-p52"></span>Do you see that the really splendid things
are those which relate to God, whereas human things are a shadow? He
knew not, it seems, that he was leading away masters for himself, and
that he cast into the furnace those whom he was about to worship. But to
them, these things were as a dream.

<span id="v.xxx-p53"></span>Let us fear God, beloved, let us fear
\[Him\]: even should we be in captivity, we are more glorious than all
men. Let the fear of God be present with us, and nothing will be
grievous, even though thou speak of poverty, or of disease, or of
captivity, or of slavery, or of any other grievous thing: Nay even these
very things will themselves work together for us the other way. These
men were captives, and the king worshiped them: Paul was a tent-maker,
and they sacrificed to him as a God.

<span id="v.xxx-p54"></span>\[8.\] Here a question arises: Why, you ask,
did the Apostles prevent the sacrifices, and rend their clothes, and
divert them from their attempt, and say with earnest lamentation, “What
are ye doing? we also are men of like passions with you” ( [Acts xiv.
15](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#015) <span id="v.xxx-p54.1"></span> .md);
whereas Daniel did nothing of this kind.

<span id="v.xxx-p55"></span> For that he also was humble, and referred
\[the\] glory to God no less than they, is evident from many places.
Especially indeed is it evident, from the very fact of his being beloved
by God. For if he had appropriated to himself the honor belonging to
God, He would not have suffered him to live, much less to be in honor.
Secondly, because even with great openness he said, “And as to me, O
King, this secret hath not been revealed to me through any wisdom that
is in me.” ( [Dan. ii. 30](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#030.md) <span
id="v.xxx-p55.1"></span> .) And again; he was in the den for God’s sake,
and when the prophet brought him food, he saith, “For God hath
remembered me.” ( [Bel 38](../../../bib/apo/bel001.htm#038.md)<span
id="v.xxx-p55.2"></span> .) Thus humble and contrite was he.

<span id="v.xxx-p56"></span>He was in the den for God’s sake, and yet he
counted himself unworthy of His remembrance, and of being heard. Yet we
though daring \[to commit\] innumerable pollutions, and being of all men
most polluted, if we be not heard at our first prayer, draw back. Truly,
great is the distance between them and us, as great as between heaven
and earth, or if there be any greater.

<span id="v.xxx-p57"></span>What sayest thou? After so many
achievements, after the miracle which had been wrought in the den, dost
thou account thyself so humble? Yea, he says; for what things soever we
have done, “we are unprofitable servants.” ( [Luke xvii.
10](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#010) <span id="v.xxx-p57.1"></span> ..md)
Thus by anticipation did he fulfill the evangelical precept, and
accounted himself nothing. For “God hath remembered me,” he said. His
prayer again, of how great lowliness of mind it is full. And again the
three children said thus, “We have sinned, we have committed iniquity.”
( <span id="v.xxx-p57.2"></span> Song of the Three Children, ver. 6 .)
And everywhere they show their humility.

<span id="v.xxx-p58"></span> And yet Daniel had occasions innumerable
for being puffed up; but he knew that these also came to him on account
of his *not* being puffed up, and he did not destroy his treasure. For
among all men, and in the whole world he was celebrated, not only  <span
id="fr_3300"></span>[3301](#fn_3300.md) because the king cast himself on
his face and offered sacrifice to him, and accounted him to be a God,
who was himself honored as God in all parts of the world: for he ruled
over the whole \[earth\]; (and this is evident from Jeremiah. “Who
putteth on the earth,” saith he, “as a garment.” (See [Jer.
43:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#012.md), [Ps.
104:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#002)<span id="v.xxx-p59.4"></span> ..md)
And again, “I have given it to Nebuchadnezzar My servant” ( [Jer. xxvii.
6](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#006) <span id="v.xxx-p59.5"></span> .md),
and again from what he \[the King\] says in his letter).  <span
id="fr_3301"></span>[3302](#fn_3301.md) And because he was held in
admiration not only in the place where he was, but everywhere, and was
greater than if the rest of the nations had been present and seen him;
when even by letters \[the King\] confessed his submission  <span
id="fr_3302"></span>[3303](#fn_3302.md) and the miracle. But yet again for
his wisdom he was also held in admiration, <span id="page_486">p.
486</span> <span id="v.xxx-Page_486"></span> for it is said, “Art thou
wiser than Daniel?” ( [Ezek. xxviii. 3](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#003.md)
<span id="v.xxx-p61.2"></span> .) And after all these things he was thus
humble, dying ten thousand times for the Lord’s sake.

<span id="v.xxx-p62"></span>Why then, you ask, being so humble did he
not repel either the adoration which was paid him by the king, or the
offerings?

<span id="v.xxx-p63"></span>\[9.\] This I will not say, for it is
sufficient for me simply to mention the question, and the rest I leave
to you, that at least in this way I may stir up your thoughts. (This
however I conjure you, to choose all things for the fear of God, having
such examples; and because in truth we shall obtain the things here
also, if we sincerely lay hold on the things which are to come.) For
that he did not do this out of arrogance, is evident from his saying,
“Thy gifts be to thyself.” ( [Dan. v.
17](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#017) <span id="v.xxx-p63.1"></span> ..md)

<span id="v.xxx-p64"></span> For besides this also again is another
question, how while in words he rejected it, in deed he received the
honor, and wore the chain  <span id="fr_3303"></span>[3304](#fn_3303.md)
\[of gold\]. ( [Dan. v. 29](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#029.md) <span
id="v.xxx-p65.2"></span> .)

<span id="v.xxx-p66"></span>Moreover while Herod on hearing the cry “It
is the voice of a god and not of a man,” inasmuch as “he gave not God
the glory, burst in sunder, and all his bowels gushed out” ( [Acts
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#022.md),
[23](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#023.md), [Acts
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#018)<span id="v.xxx-p66.1"></span> .md),
this man received to himself even the honor belonging to God, not words
only.

<span id="v.xxx-p67"></span>However it is necessary to say what this is.
In that case \[at Lystra\] the men were falling into greater idolatry,
but in this \[of Daniel\] not so. How? For his being thus accounted of,
was an honor to God. Therefore he said in anticipation, “And as to me,
not through any wisdom that is in me.” ( [Dan. ii.
30](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#030) <span id="v.xxx-p67.1"></span> ..md)
And besides he does not even appear to have accepted the offerings. For
he \[the king\] said (as it is written) that they should offer
sacrifice, but it did not appear that the act followed. But there \[at
Lystra\] they carried it even to sacrificing the bulls, and “they
called” the one “Jupiter and” the other “Mercurius.” ( [Acts xiv.
12](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#012) <span id="v.xxx-p67.2"></span> ..md)

<span id="v.xxx-p68"></span> The chain \[of gold\] then he accepted,
that he might make himself known; the offering however why does it not
appear that he rejected it? For in the other case too they did not do
it, but they attempted it, and the Apostles hindered them; wherefore
here also he ought at once to have rejected \[the adoration\]. And there
it was the entire people: here the King. Why he did not divert him
\[Daniel\] expressed by anticipation, \[viz.\] that \[the king\] was not
making an offering \[to him\] as to a God, to the overthrow of religious
worship, but for the greater wonder. How so? It was on God’s account
that \[Nebuchadnezzar\] made the decree; wherefore \[Daniel\] did not
mutilate  <span id="fr_3304"></span>[3305](#fn_3304.md) the honor
\[offered\]. But those others \[at Lystra\] did not act thus, but
supposed them to be indeed gods. On this account they were repelled.

<span id="v.xxx-p70"></span>And here, after having done him reverence,
he does these things: for he did not reverence him as a God, but as a
wise man.

<span id="v.xxx-p71"></span>But it is not clear that he made the
offering: and even if he did make it, yet not that it was with Daniel’s
acceptance.

<span id="v.xxx-p72"></span> And what \[of this\], that he called him
“Belteshazzar, the name of” his own “god”?  <span
id="fr_3305"></span>[3306](#fn_3305.md) Thus \[it seems\] they accounted
their gods to be nothing wonderful, when he called even the captive
thus; he who commands all men to worship the image,  <span
id="fr_3306"></span>[3307](#fn_3306.md) manifold and of various colors, and
who adores the dragon.  <span id="fr_3307"></span>[3308](#fn_3307.md)

<span id="v.xxx-p76"></span>Moreover the Babylonians were much more
foolish than those at Lystra. Wherefore it was not possible at once to
lead them on to this. And many \[more\] things one might say: but thus
far these suffice.

<span id="v.xxx-p77"></span>If therefore we wish to obtain all good
things, let us seek the things of God. For as they who seek the things
of this world fail both of them and of the others, so they who prefer
the things of God, obtain both. Let us then not seek these but those,
that we may attain also to the good things promised in Christ Jesus our
Lord, with whom to the Father together with the Holy Ghost, be glory,
power, honor, now and for ever and world without end. Amen.
