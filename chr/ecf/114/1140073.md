<span id="iv.lxx-p1"></span> <span class="c15"><span
id="iv.lxx-p1.1"></span>Homily LXVIII.</span>

<span id="iv.lxx-p2"></span> <span id="iv.lxx-p2.1"></span> <span
class="c1"><span id="iv.lxx-p2.2"></span>[John xii.
34](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#034.md)<span
id="iv.lxx-p2.3"></span></span>

<span id="iv.lxx-p3"></span>“The people answered Him, We have heard out
of the Law that Christ abideth for ever; and how sayest thou, The Son of
Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?”

<span id="iv.lxx-p4"></span> \[1.\] <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.lxx-p4.1"></span>Deceit</span> is a thing easily detected, and
weak, though it be daubed outside with ten thousand colors. For as those
who whitewash decayed walls, cannot by the plastering make them sound,
so too those who lie are easily found out, as in fact was the case here
with the Jews. For when Christ said to them, “If I be lifted up I will
draw all men unto Me; We have heard,” saith one of them, “out of the
Law, that Christ remaineth forever; and how sayest thou, that the Son of
Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?” Even they then knew that
Christ was some Immortal One, and had life without end. And therefore
they also knew what He meant; for often in Scripture the Passion and the
Resurrection are mentioned in the same place. Thus Isaiah puts them
together, saying, “He was led as a sheep to the slaughter” ( [Isa. liii.
7](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#007) <span id="iv.lxx-p4.2"></span> .md),
and all that follows. David also in the second Psalm, and in many other
places, connects these two things. The Patriarch too after saying, “He
lay down, He couched as a lion,” addeth, “And as a lion’s whelp, who
shall raise Him up?” ( [Gen. xlix. 9](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#009.md)
<span id="iv.lxx-p4.3"></span> .) He showeth at once the Passion and the
Resurrection. But these men when they thought to silence Him, and to
show that He was not the Christ, confessed by this very circumstance
that the Christ remaineth forever. And observe their evil dealing; they
said not, “We have heard that Christ neither suffereth nor is
crucified,” but that “He remaineth forever.” Yet even this which has
been mentioned, would have been no real objection, for the Passion was
no hindrance to His Immortality. Hence we may see that they understood
many of the doubtful points, and deliberately went wrong. For since He
had before spoken about death, when they now heard in this place the,
“be lifted up,” they guessed that death was referred to. Then they said,
“Who is this Son of Man?” This too they did deceitfully. “Think not, I
pray,” saith one, “that we say this concerning thee, assert not that we
oppose thee through enmity, for, lo, we know not concerning whom thou
speakest, and still we declare our opinion.” What then doth Christ? To
silence them, and to show that the Passion is no impediment to His
enduring forever, He saith,

<span id="iv.lxx-p5"></span> [John
12.35](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#035.md)<span id="iv.lxx-p5.1"></span> .
“Yet a little while,” He saith, “is the light with you.”

<span id="iv.lxx-p6"></span> Signifying that His death was a removal;
 <span id="fr_1907"></span>[1908](#fn_1907.md) for the light of the sun is
not destroyed, but having retired for a while appears again.

<span id="iv.lxx-p8"></span> “Walk while ye have the light.”  <span
id="fr_1908"></span>[1909](#fn_1908.md)

<span id="iv.lxx-p10"></span>Of what season doth He here speak? Of the
whole present life, or of the time before the Crucifixion? I for my part
think of both, for on account of His unspeakable lovingkindness, many
even after the Crucifixion believed. And He speaketh these things to
urge them on to the faith, as He also did before, saying, “Yet a little
while I am with you.” ( [John
7.33](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#033)<span id="iv.lxx-p10.1"></span> ..md)

<span id="iv.lxx-p11"></span>“He that walketh in darkness knoweth not
whither he goeth.”

<span id="iv.lxx-p12"></span> How many things, for instance, even now do
the Jews, without knowing what they do, but walking as though they were
in darkness? They think that they are going the right way, when they are
taking the contrary; keeping  <span id="fr_1909"></span>[1910](#fn_1909.md)
the Sabbath, respecting the Law and the observances about meats, yet
knowing not whither they walk. Wherefore He said,

<span id="iv.lxx-p14"></span> [John
12.36](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#036.md)<span id="iv.lxx-p14.1"></span> .
“Walk in the light,  <span id="fr_1910"></span>[1911](#fn_1910.md) that ye
may become children of the light.”

<span id="iv.lxx-p16"></span>That is, “My children.” Yet in the
beginning the Evangelist saith, “Were born, not of bloods, nor of the
will of the flesh, but of God” ( [John
1.13](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#013)<span id="iv.lxx-p16.1"></span> .md);
that is, of the Father; while here Himself  <span
id="fr_1911"></span>[1912](#fn_1911.md) is said to beget them; that thou
mayest understand that the operation of the Father and the Son is One.
“Jesus having spoken these things,” departed from them, and did hide
Himself.  <span id="fr_1912"></span>[1913](#fn_1912.md)

<span id="iv.lxx-p19"></span>Why doth He now “hide Himself”? They took
not up stones against Him, nor did they blaspheme Him in any such manner
as before; why then did He hide Himself? Walking in men’s hearts, He
knew that their wrath was fierce, though they said nothing; He knew it
boiling and murderous, and waited not till it issued into action, but
hid Himself, to allay their ill-will. Observe how the Evangelist has
alluded to this feeling; he has immediately added,

<span id="iv.lxx-p20"></span> [John
12.37](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#037.md)<span id="iv.lxx-p20.1"></span> .
“Though He had done so many miracles,  <span
id="fr_1913"></span>[1914](#fn_1913.md) they believed not on Him.”

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span> <span id="iv.lxx-Page_250"></span>

<span id="iv.lxx-p22"></span> \[2.\] What “so many”? So many as the
Evangelist hath omitted. And this  <span
id="fr_1914"></span>[1915](#fn_1914.md) is clear also from what follows.
For when He had retired, and given in, and had come to them again, He
speaketh with them in a lowly manner, saying, “He that believeth on Me,
believeth not on Me, but on Him that sent Me.” ( [John
12.44](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#044.md)<span id="iv.lxx-p23.2"></span>
.) Observe what He doeth. He beginneth with humble and modest
expressions, and betaketh Himself to the Father; then again He raiseth
His language, and when He seeth that they are exasperated, He retireth;
then He cometh to them again, and again beginneth with words of
humility. And where hath He done this? Nay, where hath He not done it?
See, for instance, what He saith at the beginning, “As I hear, I judge.”
( [John 5.30](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#030.md)<span
id="iv.lxx-p23.3"></span> .) Then in a loftier tone, “As the Father
raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them, so also the Son quickeneth
whom He will” ( [John 5.21](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#021.md)<span
id="iv.lxx-p23.4"></span> ); again, “I judge you not, there is another
that judgeth.” Then again He retireth. Then coming to Galilee, “Labor
not,” He saith, “for the meat that perisheth” ( [John
6.27](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#027)<span id="iv.lxx-p23.5"></span> .md);
and after having said great things of Himself, that He came down from
Heaven, that He giveth eternal life, He again withdraweth Himself. And
He cometh in the Feast of Tabernacles also, and doth the same. And one
may see Him continually thus varying His teaching, by His presence, by
His absence, by lowly, by high discourses. Which He also did here.
“Though He had done so many miracles,” it saith, “they believed not on
Him.”

<span id="iv.lxx-p24"></span> [John
12.38](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#038.md)<span id="iv.lxx-p24.1"></span> .
“That the saying of Esaias  <span id="fr_1915"></span>[1916](#fn_1915.md)
might be fulfilled which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report,
and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?” And again,

<span id="iv.lxx-p26"></span> [John
12.39-41](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#039.md)<span
id="iv.lxx-p26.1"></span> . “They  <span
id="fr_1916"></span>[1917](#fn_1916.md) could not believe,” it saith,
“because that Esaias said,  <span id="fr_1917"></span>[1918](#fn_1917.md)
Ye shall hear with your ears, and not understand.  <span
id="fr_1918"></span>[1919](#fn_1918.md) These things he said,  <span
id="fr_1919"></span>[1920](#fn_1919.md) when he saw His glory, and spake of
Him.”

<span id="iv.lxx-p31"></span>Here again observe, that the “because,” and
“spake,” refer not to the cause of their unbelief, but to the event. For
it was not “because” Isaiah spake, that they believed not; but because
they were not about to believe, that he spake. Why then doth not the
Evangelist express it so, instead of making the unbelief proceed from
the prophecy, not the prophecy from the unbelief? And farther on he
putteth this very thing more positively, saying, “Therefore they could
not believe, because that Esaias said.” He desires hence to establish by
many proofs the unerring truth of Scripture, and that what Isaiah
foretold fell not out otherwise, but as he said. For lest any one should
say, “Wherefore did Christ come? Knew he not that they would give no
heed to him?” he introduces the Prophets, who knew this also. But He
came that they might have no excuse for their sin; for what things the
Prophet foretold, he foretold as certainly to be; since if they were not
certainly to be, he could not have foretold them; and they were
certainly to be, because these men were incurable.

<span id="iv.lxx-p32"></span> And if, “they could not,” is put, instead
of, “they would not,” do not marvel,  <span
id="fr_1920"></span>[1921](#fn_1920.md) for He saith also in another place,
“He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.” ( [Matt. xix.
12](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#012) <span id="iv.lxx-p33.7"></span> ..md)
So in many places He is wont to term choice, power. Again, “The world
cannot hate you, but Me it hateth.” ( [John
7.7](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#007)<span id="iv.lxx-p33.8"></span> ..md)
This one may even see observed in common conversation; as when a man
saith, “I cannot love this or that person,” calling the force of his
will, power. And again, “this or that person cannot be a good man.” And
what saith the Prophet? “If the Ethiopian shall change his skin, or the
leopard his spots, this people also shall be able to do good, having
learned evil.” ( [Jer. xiii. 23](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#023.md) <span
id="iv.lxx-p33.9"></span> , LXX.) He saith not that the doing of virtue
is impossible to them, but that because they will not, therefore they
cannot. And by what he saith the Evangelist means, that it was
impossible for the Prophet to lie; yet it was not on that account
impossible that they should believe. For it was possible, even had they
believed, that he should remain true; since he would not have prophesied
these things if they had been about to believe. “Why then,” saith some
one, “did he not say so?” Because Scripture hath certain idiomatic
phrases of this kind, and it is needful to make allowance for its laws.

<span id="iv.lxx-p34"></span> “The seethings he spake when he saw His
glory.” Whose?  The Father’s. How then doth John speak of the Son? and
Paul of the Spirit? Not as confounding the Persons, but as showing that
the Dignity is one, they say it.  <span
id="fr_1921"></span>[1922](#fn_1921.md) For that which is the Father’s is
the Son’s also, and that which is the Son’s is the Spirit’s.  <span
id="fr_1922"></span>[1923](#fn_1922.md) Yet many things God spake by
Angels, and no one saith, “as the Angel spake,” but how? “as God spake.”
Since what hath been said by God through the ministry of Angels would be
of God; yet not therefore is what is of God, of the Angels also. But in
this place John saith that the words are the Spirit’s.

<span id="iv.lxx-p37"></span>“And spake of Him.” What spake he? “I saw
the Lord sitting upon a high throne” ( [Isa. vi.
1](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#001) <span id="iv.lxx-p37.1"></span> .md),
and what follows. Therefore he there <span id="page_251">p. 251</span>
<span id="iv.lxx-Page_251"></span> calleth “glory,” that vision, the
smoke, the hearing unutterable Mysteries, the beholding the Seraphim,
the lightning which leaped from the throne, against which those powers
could not look. “And spake of Him.” What said he? That he heard a voice,
saying, “Whom shall I send? who shall go? And I said, Here am I, send
me. And He said, Ye shall hear with your ears, and shall not understand,
and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive.” ( [Isa.
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#008.md),
[10](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#010)<span id="iv.lxx-p37.2"></span> ..md)
For,

<span id="iv.lxx-p38"></span> [John
12.40](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#040.md)<span id="iv.lxx-p38.1"></span> .
“He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart, lest they at any
time should see with their eyes, and understand with their heart.”

<span id="iv.lxx-p39"></span> Here again is another question, but it is
not so if we rightly consider it. For as the sun dazzles the eyes of the
weak, not by reason of  <span id="fr_1923"></span>[1924](#fn_1923.md) its
proper nature, so it is with those who give not heed to the words of
God. Thus, in the case of Pharaoh, He is said to have hardened his
heart, and so it is with those who are at all contentious against the
words of God. This is a peculiar mode of speech in Scripture, as also
the, “He gave them over unto a reprobate mind” ( [Rom. i.
28](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#028) <span id="iv.lxx-p40.2"></span> .md),
and the, “He divided them to the nations,”  <span
id="fr_1924"></span>[1925](#fn_1924.md) that is, allowed, permitted them to
go. For the writer doth not here introduce God as Himself working these
things, but showeth that they took place through the wickedness of
others. For, when we are abandoned by God, we are given up to the devil,
and when so given up, we suffer ten thousand dreadful things. To terrify
the hearer, therefore, the writer saith, “He hardened,” and “gave over.”
For to show that He doth not only not give us over, but doth not even
leave us, except we will it, hear what He saith, “Do not your iniquities
separate between Me and you?” ( [Isa. lix.
2](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#002.md) <span id="iv.lxx-p41.8"></span> ,
LXX.). And again, “They that go far away from Thee shall perish.” ( [Ps.
lxxiii. 27](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#027.md) <span
id="iv.lxx-p41.9"></span> , LXX.) And Hosea saith, “Thou hast forgotten
the law of thy God, and I will also forget thee” ( [Hos. iv.
6](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#006.md) <span id="iv.lxx-p41.10"></span> ,
LXX.); and He saith Himself also in the Gospels, “How often would I have
gathered your children—and ye would not.” ( [Luke xiii.
34](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#034) <span id="iv.lxx-p41.11"></span> ..md)
Esaias also again, “I came, and there was no man; I called, and there
was none to hearken.” ( [Isa. l. 2](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#002.md)
<span id="iv.lxx-p41.12"></span> , LXX.) These things He saith, showing
that we begin the desertion, and become the causes of our perdition; for
God not only desireth not to leave or to punish us, but even when He
punisheth, doth it unwillingly; “I will not,” He saith, “the death of a
sinner, so much as that he should turn and live.” ( [Ezek. xviii.
32](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#032.md) <span id="iv.lxx-p41.13"></span> ,
LXX.) Christ also mourneth over the destruction of Jerusalem,  <span
id="fr_1925"></span>[1926](#fn_1925.md) as we also do over our friends.

<span id="iv.lxx-p43"></span> \[3.\] Knowing this, let us do all so as
not to remove from God, but let us hold fast to the care of our souls,
and to the love towards each other; let us not tear our own members,
(for this  <span id="fr_1926"></span>[1927](#fn_1926.md) is the act of men
insane and beside themselves,) but the more we see any ill disposed, the
more let us be kind to them. Since we often see many persons suffering
 <span id="fr_1927"></span>[1928](#fn_1927.md) in their bodies from
difficult or incurable maladies, and cease not to apply remedies. What
is worse than gout in foot or hand? Are we therefore to cut off the
limbs? Not at all, but we use every means that the sufferer may enjoy
some comfort, since we cannot get rid of the disease. This also let us
do in the case of our brethren, and, even though they be diseased
incurably, let us continue to tend them, and let us bear one another’s
burdens. So shall we fulfill the law of Christ, and obtain the promised
good things, through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus
Christ, with whom to the Father and the Holy Ghost be glory for ever and
ever. Amen.
