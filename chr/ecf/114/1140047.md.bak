<span id="iv.xliv-p3"></span> *“After these things Jesus went over the
sea of Galilee, into the parts of*  <span
id="fr_1148"></span>[1149](#fn_1148.md) *Tiberias. And a great multitude
followed Him, because they saw the*  <span
id="fr_1149"></span>[1150](#fn_1149.md) *miracles which He did on them that
were diseased. And Jesus departed*  <span
id="fr_1150"></span>[1151](#fn_1150.md) *into a mountain, and there sat
with His disciples. And the Passover of the Jews*  <span
id="fr_1151"></span>[1152](#fn_1151.md) *was nigh.”*

<span id="iv.xliv-p8"></span> \[1.\] <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.xliv-p8.1"></span>Beloved</span> , let us not contend with
violent men, but learn  <span id="fr_1152"></span>[1153](#fn_1152.md) when
the doing so brings no hurt to our virtue to give place to their evil
counsels; for so all their hardihood is checked. As darts when they fall
upon a firm,  <span id="fr_1153"></span>[1154](#fn_1153.md) hard, and
resisting substance, rebound with great violence on those who throw
them, but when the violence of the cast hath nothing to oppose it, it
soon becometh weaker and ceaseth, so is it with insolent men; when we
contend with them they become the fiercer, but when we yield and give
ground, we easily abate all their madness. Wherefore the Lord when He
knew that the Pharisees had heard “that Jesus made and baptized more
disciples than John,” went into Galilee, to quench their envy, and to
soften by His retirement the wrath which was likely to be engendered by
these reports. And when He departed for the second time into Galilee, He
cometh not to the same places as before; for He went not to Cana, <span
id="page_149">p. 149</span> <span id="iv.xliv-Page_149"></span> but to
“the other side of the sea,” and  <span
id="fr_1154"></span>[1155](#fn_1154.md) great multitudes followed Him,
beholding “the miracles which He did.” What miracles? Why doth he  <span
id="fr_1155"></span>[1156](#fn_1155.md) not mention them specifically?
Because this Evangelist most of all was desirous of employing the
greater part of his book on the discourses and sermons \[of Christ\].
Observe, for instance, how for a whole year, or rather how even now at
the feast of the Passover, he hath given us no more information on the
head of miracles, than merely that He healed the paralytic and the
nobleman’s son. Because he was not anxious to enumerate them all, (that
would have been impossible,) but of many and great to record a few.

<span id="iv.xliv-p13"></span> [John
6.2](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#002.md)<span id="iv.xliv-p13.1"></span> .
“A great multitude followed Him beholding the miracles that He did.”
What is here told marks not a very wise state of mind;  <span
id="fr_1156"></span>[1157](#fn_1156.md) for when they had enjoyed such
teaching, they still were more attracted by the miracles, which was a
sign of the grosser state. For “miracles,” It saith, “are not for
believers, but for unbelievers.”  <span
id="fr_1157"></span>[1158](#fn_1157.md) The people described by Matthew
acted not thus,  <span id="fr_1158"></span>[1159](#fn_1158.md) but how?
They all, he saith “were astonished at His doctrine, because He taught
as one having authority.” ( [Matt.
7:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#028.md),
[29](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#029)<span id="iv.xliv-p16.3"></span> ..md)

<span id="iv.xliv-p17"></span> “And why doth He occupy the mountain now,
and sit there with His disciples?” Because of the miracle which was
about to take place. And that the disciples alone went up with Him, was
a charge against the multitude which followed Him not. Yet not for this
only did He go up into the mountain, but to teach us ever to rest at
intervals from the tumults and confusion of common life.  <span
id="fr_1159"></span>[1160](#fn_1159.md) For solitude is a thing meet for
the study of wisdom. And often doth He go up alone into a mountain, and
spend the night there, and pray, to teach us that the man who will come
most near to God must be free from all disturbance, and must seek times
and places clear of confusion.

<span id="iv.xliv-p19"></span> [John
6.4](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#004.md)<span id="iv.xliv-p19.1"></span> .
“And the Passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh.”

<span id="iv.xliv-p20"></span>“How then,” saith some one, “doth He not
go up unto the feast, but, when all are pressing to Jerusalem, goeth
Himself into Galilee, and not Himself alone, but taketh His disciples
with Him, and proceedeth thence to Capernaum?” Because henceforth He was
quietly annulling the Law, taking occasion from the wickedness of. the
Jews.

<span id="iv.xliv-p21"></span> [John
6.5](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#005.md)<span id="iv.xliv-p21.1"></span> .
“And as He lifted up His eyes, He beheld a great company.”  <span
id="fr_1160"></span>[1161](#fn_1160.md)

<span id="iv.xliv-p23"></span> This showeth that He sat not at any time
idly  <span id="fr_1161"></span>[1162](#fn_1161.md) with the disciples, but
perhaps carefully conversing with them, and making them attend  <span
id="fr_1162"></span>[1163](#fn_1162.md) and turn towards Him, a thing which
peculiarly marks  <span id="fr_1163"></span>[1164](#fn_1163.md) His tender
care, and the humility and condescension of His demeanor towards them.
For they sat with Him, perhaps looking at one another; then having
lifted up His eyes, He beheld the multitudes coming unto Him. Now the
other Evangelists say, that the disciples came and asked and besought
Him that He would not send them away fasting, while St. John saith, that
the question was put to Philip by Christ. Both occurrences seem to me to
be truly reported, but not to have taken place at the same time, the
former account being prior to the other, so that the two are entirely
different.

<span id="iv.xliv-p27"></span>Wherefore then doth He ask “Philip”? He
knew which of His disciples needed most instruction; for this is he who
afterwards said, “Show us the Father, and it sufficeth us” ( [John
14.8](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#008.md)<span id="iv.xliv-p27.1"></span>
), and on this account Jesus was beforehand bringing him into a proper
state.  <span id="fr_1164"></span>[1165](#fn_1164.md) For had the miracle
simply been done, the marvel would not have seemed so great, but now He
beforehand constraineth him to confess the existing want, that knowing
the state of matters he might be the more exactly acquainted with the
magnitude of the miracle about to take place. Wherefore He saith,  <span
id="fr_1165"></span>[1166](#fn_1165.md)

<span id="iv.xliv-p30"></span> “Whence shall we have so many loaves,
 <span id="fr_1166"></span>[1167](#fn_1166.md) that these may eat?”

<span id="iv.xliv-p32"></span> So in the Old \[Testament\] He spake to
Moses, for He wrought not the sign until He had asked him, “What is that
in thy hand?” Because things coming to pass unexpectedly and all at
once,  <span id="fr_1167"></span>[1168](#fn_1167.md) are wont to throw us
into forgetfulness of things previous, therefore He first involved him
in a confession of present circumstances, that when the astonishment
should have come upon him, he might be unable afterwards to drive away
the remembrance of what he had confessed, and thus might learn by
comparison the greatness of the miracle, which in fact takes place in
this instance; for Philip being asked, replied,

<span id="iv.xliv-p34"></span> [John
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#007.md),
[6](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#006.md)<span id="iv.xliv-p34.1"></span>

<span id="iv.xliv-p35"></span><span id="page_150">p. 150</span> <span
id="iv.xliv-Page_150"></span>[Gen.
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#001.md),
[2](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#002)<span id="iv.xliv-p35.1"></span> .md);
yet it doth not appear in that place either, that when He saith this He
waited to see the end of the trial, whether Abraham would obey or not,
(how could He, who knoweth all things before they come into existence?
 <span id="fr_1168"></span>[1169](#fn_1168.md) but the words in both cases
are spoken after the manner of men. For as when (the Psalmist  <span
id="fr_1169"></span>[1170](#fn_1169) .md) saith that He “searcheth the
hearts of men,” he meaneth not a search of ignorance but of exact
knowledge, just so when the Evangelist saith that He proved (Philip), he
meaneth only that He knew exactly. And perhaps one might say another
thing, that as He once made Abraham more approved, so also did He this
man, bringing him by this question to an exact knowledge of the miracle.
The Evangelist therefore, that thou mayest not stop at the feebleness of
the expression, and so form an improper opinion of what was said,
addeth, “He Himself knew what He would do.”

<span id="iv.xliv-p38"></span> Moreover we must observe this, that when
there is any wrong suspicion, the writer straightway very carefully
corrects  <span id="fr_1170"></span>[1171](#fn_1170.md) it. As then in this
place that the hearers might not form any such suspicion, he adds the
corrective, saying, “For He Himself knew what He would do”: so also in
that other place, when He saith, that “the Jews persecuted Him, because
He not only had broken the Sabbath, but said also that God was His
Father, making Himself equal with God,” had there not been the assertion
of Christ Himself confirmed by His works, he would there also have
subjoined this correction.  For if even in words which Christ speaketh
the Evangelist is careful that none should have suspicions, much more in
cases where others were speaking of Him would he have looked closely,
had he perceived that an improper opinion prevailed concerning Him. But
he did not so, for he knew that this  <span
id="fr_1171"></span>[1172](#fn_1171.md) was His meaning,  <span
id="fr_1172"></span>[1173](#fn_1172.md) and immovable decree.  <span
id="fr_1173"></span>[1174](#fn_1173.md) Therefore after saying, “making
Himself equal with God,” he used not any such correction; for the matter
spoken of was not an erroneous fancy of theirs, but His own assertion
ratified by His works. Philip then having been questioned,

<span id="iv.xliv-p43"></span> [John
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#008.md),
[9](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#009.md)<span id="iv.xliv-p43.1"></span> .
“Andrew, Simon’s  <span id="fr_1174"></span>[1175](#fn_1174.md) brother,
said, There is a lad here, which hath five barley loaves, and two small
fishes: but what are they among so many?”

<span id="iv.xliv-p45"></span> Andrew is higher minded than Philip, yet
had not he attained to everything. Yet I do not think that he spake
without an object, but as having heard  <span
id="fr_1175"></span>[1176](#fn_1175.md) of the miracles of the Prophets,
and how Elisha wrought a sign with the loaves ( [2 Kings iv.
43](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#043) <span id="iv.xliv-p46.3"></span> .md);
on this account he mounted to a certain height,  <span
id="fr_1176"></span>[1177](#fn_1176.md) but could not attain to the very
top.

<span id="iv.xliv-p48"></span> Let us learn then,  <span
id="fr_1177"></span>[1178](#fn_1177.md) we who give ourselves to luxury,
what was the fare of those great and admirable men; and in quality and
quantity  <span id="fr_1178"></span>[1179](#fn_1178.md) let us behold and
imitate the thriftiness of their table.

<span id="iv.xliv-p51"></span> What follows also expresses great
weakness. For after saying, “hath five barley loaves,” he addeth, “but
what are they among so many?” He supposed that the Worker of the miracle
would make less out of less, and more out of more. But this was not the
case, for it was alike easy to Him to cause bread to spring forth  <span
id="fr_1179"></span>[1180](#fn_1179.md) from more and from less, since He
needed no subject-matter. But in order that the creation might not seem
foreign to His Wisdom, as afterwards slanderers and those affected with
the disease of Marcion  <span id="fr_1180"></span>[1181](#fn_1180.md) said,
He used the creation itself as a groundwork for His marvels.

<span id="iv.xliv-p54"></span> When both the disciples had owned
themselves at a loss, then He wrought the miracle; for thus they
profited the more, having first confessed the difficulty of the matter,
that when it should come to pass, they might understand the power of
God. And because a miracle was about to be wrought, which had also been
performed by the Prophets, although not in an equal degree, and because
He would do it after first giving thanks, lest they should fall into any
suspicion of weakness on His part, observe how by the very manner of His
working He entirely raiseth their thoughts of it and showeth them the
difference (between Himself and others). For when the loaves had not yet
appeared,  <span id="fr_1181"></span>[1182](#fn_1181.md) that thou mayest
learn, that things that are not are to Him as though they were, (as Paul
saith, “who calleth the things that be not as though they were”— [Rom.
iv. 17](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#017.md) <span
id="iv.xliv-p55.4"></span> ,) He commanded them as though the table were
prepared and ready, straightway to sit down, rousing by this the minds
of His disciples. And because  <span
id="fr_1182"></span>[1183](#fn_1182.md) they had profited by the
questioning, they immediately obeyed, and were not confounded, nor said,
“How is this, why dost Thou bid us sit down, when there is nothing
before us?” The same men, who at first disbelieved so much as to say,
“Whence shall we buy bread?” began so far to believe even before they
saw the miracle,  <span id="fr_1183"></span>[1184](#fn_1183.md) that they
readily made the multitudes to sit down.

<span id="iv.xliv-p58"></span> <span id="page_151">p. 151</span> <span
id="iv.xliv-Page_151"></span> \[3.\] But why when He was about to
restore the paralytic did He not pray, nor when He was raising the dead,
or bridling the sea, while He doth so here over the loaves? It was to
show that when we begin our meals, we ought to give thanks unto God.
Moreover, He doth it especially in a lesser matter, that thou mayest
learn that He doth it not as having any need; for were this the case,
much more would He have done so in greater things; but when He did them
by His own authority, it is clear that it was through condescension that
He acted as He did in the case of the lesser. Besides, a great multitude
was present, and it was necessary that they should be persuaded that He
had come according to the will of God. Wherefore, when He doth miracles
in the absence of witnesses, He exhibiteth nothing of the kind; but when
He doth them in the presence of many, in order to persuade them that He
is no enemy of God, no adversary of Him who hath begotten Him, He
removeth the suspicion by thanksgiving.

<span id="iv.xliv-p59"></span> “And He gave to them that were set down,
and they were filled.”  <span id="fr_1184"></span>[1185](#fn_1184.md)

<span id="iv.xliv-p61"></span>Seest thou how great is the interval
between the servants and the Master? They having grace by measure,
wrought their miracles accordingly, but God, who acteth with free power,
did all most abundantly.

<span id="iv.xliv-p62"></span> [John
6.12](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#012.md)<span id="iv.xliv-p62.1"></span> .
“And He said  <span id="fr_1185"></span>[1186](#fn_1185.md) unto His
disciples, Gather up the fragments which remain;  <span
id="fr_1186"></span>[1187](#fn_1186.md) —and they gathered them together,
and filled twelve baskets.”

<span id="iv.xliv-p65"></span> This was not a superfluous show, but in
order that the matter might not be deemed a mere illusion; and for this
reason He createth  <span id="fr_1187"></span>[1188](#fn_1187.md) from
matter already subsisting. “But why gave He not the bread to the
multitudes to bear, but (only) to His disciples?” Because He was most
desirous to instruct these who were to be the teachers of the world. The
multitude would not as yet reap any great fruit from the miracles, (at
least they straightway forgot this one and asked for another,) while
these would gain no common profit. And what took place was moreover no
ordinary condemnation of Judas, who bore a basket. And that these things
were done for their instruction is plain from what is said afterwards,
when He reminded them, saying, “Do ye not yet understand—how many
baskets ye took up?” ( [Matt. xvi. 9](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#009.md)
<span id="iv.xliv-p66.2"></span> .) And for the same reason it was that
the baskets of fragments were equal in number to the disciples;
afterwards, when they were instructed, they took not up so many, but
only “seven baskets.” ( [Matt. xv. 37](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#037.md)
<span id="iv.xliv-p66.3"></span> .) And I marvel not only at the
quantity of loaves created, but besides the quantity, at the exactness
of the surplus, that He caused the superabundance to be neither more nor
less than just so much as He willed, foreseeing how much they would
consume; a thing which marked unspeakable power. The fragments then
confirmed the matter, showing both these points; that what had taken
place  <span id="fr_1188"></span>[1189](#fn_1188.md) was no illusion, and
that these were from the loaves by which the people had been fed. As to
the fishes, they at this time were produced from those already
subsisting, but at a later period, after the Resurrection, they were not
made from subsisting matter. “Wherefore?” That thou mayest understand
that even now He employed matter, not from necessity, nor as needing any
base  <span id="fr_1189"></span>[1190](#fn_1189) (to work upon.md), but to
stop the mouths of heretics.  <span id="fr_1190"></span>[1191](#fn_1190.md)

<span id="iv.xliv-p70"></span> “And the multitudes said, that this is of
a truth The Prophet.”  <span id="fr_1191"></span>[1192](#fn_1191.md)

<span id="iv.xliv-p72"></span> Oh, excess of gluttony! He had done ten
thousand things more admirable than this, but nowhere did they make this
confession, save when they had been filled. Yet hence it is evident that
they expected some remarkable prophet; for those others had said (to
John), “Art thou that Prophet?”  <span
id="fr_1192"></span>[1193](#fn_1192.md) while these say, “This is that
Prophet.”

<span id="iv.xliv-p74"></span> [John
6.15](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#015.md)<span id="iv.xliv-p74.1"></span> .
 “When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take Him by
force to make Him a king, He departed again into a mountain.”  <span
id="fr_1193"></span>[1194](#fn_1193.md)

<span id="iv.xliv-p76"></span> Wonderful! How great is the tyranny of
gluttony, how great the fickleness of men’s minds! No longer do they
vindicate the Law, no longer do they care for the violation  <span
id="fr_1194"></span>[1195](#fn_1194.md) of the Sabbath, no longer are they
zealous for God; all such considerations are thrown aside, when their
bellies have been filled; He was a prophet in their eyes, and they were
about to choose Him for a king. But Christ fleeth. “Wherefore?” To teach
us to despise worldly dignities, and to show us that He needed nothing
on earth. For He who chose  <span id="fr_1195"></span>[1196](#fn_1195.md)
all things mean, both mother and house and city and nurture and attire
would not afterwards be made illustrious by things on earth. The things
which (He had) from heaven were glorious and great, angels, a star, His
Father loudly speaking,  <span id="fr_1196"></span>[1197](#fn_1196.md) the
<span id="page_152">p. 152</span> <span id="iv.xliv-Page_152"></span>
Spirit testifying, and Prophets proclaiming Him from afar; those on
earth were all mean, that thus His power might the more appear. He came
also to teach us to despise the things of the world, and not be amazed
or astonished by the splendors of this life, but to laugh them all to
scorn, and to desire those which are to come. For he who admires things
which are here, will not admire those in the heavens. Wherefore also He
saith to Pilate, “My Kingdom is not of this world” ( [John
18.36](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#036.md)<span id="iv.xliv-p79.2"></span>
), that He may not afterwards appear to have employed mere human terror
or dominion for the purpose of persuasion. Why then saith the Prophet,
“Behold, thy King cometh unto thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass”? (
[Zech. ix. 9](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#009.md) <span
id="iv.xliv-p79.3"></span> .) He spake of that Kingdom which is in the
heavens, but not of this on earth; and on this account Christ saith, “I
receive not honor from men.” ( [John
5.41](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#041.md)<span id="iv.xliv-p79.4"></span>
.)

<span id="iv.xliv-p80"></span> Learn we then, beloved, to despise and
not to desire the honor which is from men; for we have been honored with
the greatest of honors, compared with which that other is verily  <span
id="fr_1197"></span>[1198](#fn_1197.md) insult, ridicule, and mockery. And
as the riches of this world compared with the riches of that are
poverty, as this life apart from that is deadness,  <span
id="fr_1198"></span>[1199](#fn_1198.md) (for “let  <span
id="fr_1199"></span>[1200](#fn_1199.md) the dead bury their dead”— [Matt.
viii. 28](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#028.md) <span
id="iv.xliv-p83.4"></span> ,) so this honor compared with that is shame
and ridicule. Let us then not pursue it. If they who confer it are of
less account than a shadow or a dream, the honor itself much more so.
“The glory of man is as the flower of the grass” ( [1 Pet. i.
24](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#024) <span id="iv.xliv-p83.5"></span> .md);
and what is meaner than the flower of the grass? Were this glory
everlasting, in what could it profit the soul? In nothing. Nay, it very
greatly injures us by making us slaves, slaves in worse condition than
those bought with money, slaves who obey not one master only, but two,
three, ten thousand, all giving different commands. How much better is
it to be a free man than a slave, to be free from the slavery of men,
and subject only to the dominion of God? In a word, if thou wilt desire
glory, desire it, but let it be the glory immortal, for that is
exhibited on a more glorious stage, and brings greater profit. For
 <span id="fr_1200"></span>[1201](#fn_1200.md) the men here bid thee be at
charges to please them, but Christ, on the contrary, giveth thee an
hundredfold for what thou givest Him, and addeth moreover eternal life.
Which of the two then is better, to be admired  <span
id="fr_1201"></span>[1202](#fn_1201.md) on earth, or in heaven? by man, or
by God? to your loss, or to your gain? to wear a crown for a single day,
or for endless ages? Give to him that needeth, but give not to a dancer,
lest thou lose thy money and destroy his soul. For thou art the cause of
his (coming to) perdition through unseasonable munificence.  <span
id="fr_1202"></span>[1203](#fn_1202.md) Since did those on the stage know
that their employment would be unprofitable, they would have long ago
ceased to practice it; but when they behold thee applauding, crowding
after them, spending and wasting thy substance upon them, even if they
have no desire to follow (their profession), they are kept to it by the
desire of gain. If they knew that no one would praise what they do, they
would soon desist from their labors, by reason of their
unprofitableness; but when they see that the action is admired by many,
the praise of others becomes a bait to them. Let us then desist from
this unprofitable expense, let us learn upon whom and when we ought to
spend. Let us not, I implore you, provoke God in both ways, gathering
whence we ought not, and scattering where we ought not; for what anger
doth not thy conduct deserve, when thou passest by the poor and givest
to a harlot? Would not the paying the hire of sin and the bestowing
honor where it were meet to punish have been a charge against thee, even
hadst thou paid out of thy just earnings? but when thou feedest thine
uncleanness by stripping orphans and wronging widows, consider how great
a fire is prepared for those who dare such things. Hear what Paul saith,
“Who not only do these things, but also have pleasure in  <span
id="fr_1203"></span>[1204](#fn_1203.md) them that do them.” ( [Rom. i.
32](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#032) <span id="iv.xliv-p87.3"></span> ..md)

<span id="iv.xliv-p88"></span> Perhaps we have touched you sharply, yet
if we touch you not, there are actual  <span
id="fr_1204"></span>[1205](#fn_1204.md) punishments awaiting those who sin
without amendment. What then availeth it to gratify by words those who
shall be punished by realities? Dost thou take pleasure  <span
id="fr_1205"></span>[1206](#fn_1205.md) at a dancer, dost thou praise and
admire him? Then art thou worse than he; his poverty affords him an
excuse though not a reasonable one, but thou art stripped even of this
defense. If I ask him, “Why hast thou left other arts and come to this
accursed and impure one?” he will reply, “because I can with little
labor gain great profits.” But if I ask thee why thou admirest one who
spends his time in impurity, and lives to the mischief of many, thou
canst not run to the same excuse, but must bow down thy face and be
ashamed and blush. Now if when called by us to give account, thou
wouldest have nothing to reply,  <span
id="fr_1206"></span>[1207](#fn_1206.md) when that terrible and inexorable
Judgment cometh where we shall render account of thoughts and deeds and
everything, how shall we stand? with what eyes shall we behold our
Judge? what shall we say? what defense shall we make? what excuse
reasonable or unreasonable shall we put forward? shall we allege the
expense? the gratification? the perdition of others whom by means of his
art we ruin? We can have nothing to say, but must be punished <span
id="page_153">p. 153</span> <span id="iv.xliv-Page_153"></span> with a
punishment having no end, knowing no limit. That this come not to pass,
let us henceforth guard all points, that having departed with a good
hope, we may obtain the everlasting blessings; to which may we all
attain through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, by
whom and with whom to the Father and the Holy Ghost be glory, now and
ever and world without end. Amen.
