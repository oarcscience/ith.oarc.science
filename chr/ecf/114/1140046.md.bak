<span id="iv.xliii-p3"></span> *“Search the Scriptures; for in them ye
think ye have eternal life; and they are they which testify of Me. And
ye will not come to Me that ye might have \[eternal*  <span
id="fr_1125"></span>[1126](#fn_1125.md) *\] life.”*

<span id="iv.xliii-p5"></span> \[1.\] <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.xliii-p5.1"></span>Beloved</span> , let us make great account of
spiritual things, and not think that it is sufficient for us to
salvation to pursue them anyhow. For if in things of this life a man can
gain no great profit if he conduct them in an indifferent and chance
way, much more will this be the case in spiritual things, since these
require yet greater attention. Wherefore Christ when He referred the
Jews to the Scriptures, sent them not to a mere reading, but a careful
and considerate  <span id="fr_1126"></span>[1127](#fn_1126.md) search; for
He said not, “Read the Scriptures,” but, “Search the Scriptures.” Since
the sayings relating to Him required great attention, (for they had been
concealed from the beginning for the advantage of the men of that time,)
He biddeth them now dig down with care that they might be able to
discover what lay in the depth below. These sayings were not on the
surface, nor were they cast forth to open view, but lay like some
treasure hidden very deep. Now he that searcheth for hidden things,
except he seek them with care and toil, will never find the object of
his search. For which cause He said, “Search the Scriptures, because in
them ye think ye have eternal life.” He said not, “Ye have,” but “ye
think,” showing that they gained from them nothing great or high,
expecting as they did to be saved by the mere reading, without the addi
<span id="page_146">p. 146</span> <span id="iv.xliii-Page_146"></span>
tion of  <span id="fr_1127"></span>[1128](#fn_1127.md) faith. What He saith
therefore is of this kind: “Do ye not admire the Scriptures, do ye not
think that they are the causes of all life? By these I confirm My claims
now, for they are they which testify of Me, yet ye will not come to Me
that ye may have eternal life.” It was thus with good reason that He
said, “ye think,” because they would not obey, but merely prided
themselves on the bare reading. Then lest owing to His very tender care
He should incur among them the suspicion of vainglory, and because He
desired to be believed by them, should be deemed to be seeking His own;
(for He reminded them of the words of John, and of the witness of God,
and of His own works, and said all He could to draw them to Him, and
promised them “life”;  <span id="fr_1128"></span>[1129](#fn_1128) .md)
since, I say, it was likely that many would suspect that He spake these
things from a desire of glory, hear what He saith:

<span id="iv.xliii-p9"></span> [John
5.41](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#041.md)<span id="iv.xliii-p9.1"></span> .
“I receive not honor from men.”

<span id="iv.xliii-p10"></span>That is, “I need it not”: “My nature,” He
saith, “is not of such a kind as to need the honor which is from men,
for if the sun can receive no addition from the light of a candle, much
farther am I from needing the honor which is from men.” “Why then,” asks
some one, “sayest thou these things, if thou needest it not?” “That ye
may be saved.” This He positively asserted above, and the same He
implied here also, by saying, “that ye might have life.” Moreover, He
putteth another reason:

<span id="iv.xliii-p11"></span> [John
5.42](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#042.md)<span id="iv.xliii-p11.1"></span>
. “But I know you that ye have not the love of God in you.”

<span id="iv.xliii-p12"></span> For when under pretense of loving God
they  <span id="fr_1129"></span>[1130](#fn_1129.md) persecuted Him because
He made Himself equal with God, and He knew that they would not believe
Him, lest any one should ask, “why speakest thou these words?” “I speak
them,” He saith, “to convict you of this, that it is not for the love of
God that ye persecute Me, if it be so that He testifieth to Me both by
works and by the Scriptures. For as before this when ye deemed Me an
enemy of God ye drove Me away, so now, since I have declared these
things, ye ought to have hastened to Me, if ye had really loved. God.
But ye love Him not. And therefore have I spoken these words, to show
that you are possessed with excessive pride, that you are vainly
boasting and shading over  <span id="fr_1130"></span>[1131](#fn_1130.md)
your own enviousness.” And the same He proveth not by these things only,
but by those that should come to pass.

<span id="iv.xliii-p15"></span> [John
5.43](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#043.md)<span id="iv.xliii-p15.1"></span>
. “I am come in My Father’s name, and ye receive Me not; if another
shall come in his own name, him will ye receive.”

<span id="iv.xliii-p16"></span> \[2.\] Seest thou that He everywhere
declareth that He hath been “sent,” that judgment hath been committed to
Him by the Father, that He can do nothing of Himself, in order that He
may cut off all excuse for their unfairness? But who is it that He here
saith shall come “in his own name”? He alludeth here to Antichrist, and
putteth  <span id="fr_1131"></span>[1132](#fn_1131.md) an incontrovertible
proof of their unfairness. “For if as loving God ye persecute Me, much
more ought this to have taken place  <span
id="fr_1132"></span>[1133](#fn_1132.md) in the case of Antichrist. For he
will neither say that he is sent by the Father, nor that he cometh
according to his will, but in everything contrariwise, seizing like a
tyrant what belongeth not to him, and asserting that he is the very God
over all, as Paul saith, ‘Exalting himself above all that is called God,
or that is worshiped, showing himself that he is God.’ ( [2 Thess. ii.
4](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#004) <span id="iv.xliii-p18.3"></span> ..md)
This is to ‘come in his own name.’ I do not so, but am come in the Name
of My Father.” That they received not One who said that He was sent of
God, was a sufficient proof that they loved not God; but now from the
contrary of this fact, from their being about to receive Antichrist, He
showeth their shamelessness.  <span id="fr_1133"></span>[1134](#fn_1133.md)
For when they received not One who asserteth that He was sent by God,
and are about to worship one who knoweth Him not, and who saith that he
is God over all, it is clear that their persecution proceeded from
malice and from hating God. On this account He putteth two reasons for
His words; and first the kinder one,  <span
id="fr_1134"></span>[1135](#fn_1134.md) “That ye may be saved”; and, “That
ye may have life”: and when they would have mocked at Him, He putteth
the other which was more striking, showing that even although His
hearers should not believe, yet that God was wont always to do His own
works. Now Paul speaking concerning Antichrist said prophetically, that
“God shall send them strong delusion,—that they all might be judged who
believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.” ( [2
Thess. 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#011.md),
[12](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#012.md)<span id="iv.xliii-p20.3"></span>
.) Christ said not, “He shall come”; but, “if He come,” from tenderness
for His hearers; and because all their obstinacy  <span
id="fr_1135"></span>[1136](#fn_1135.md) was not yet complete. He was silent
as to the reason of His coming; but Paul, for those who can understand,
has particularly alluded to it. For it is he who taketh away all excuse
from them.

<span id="iv.xliii-p22"></span>Christ then putteth also the cause of
their unbelief, saying,

<span id="iv.xliii-p23"></span> [John
5.44](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#044.md)<span id="iv.xliii-p23.1"></span>
. “How can ye believe, which receive honor one of another, and seek not
the honor that cometh from God only?”

<span id="iv.xliii-p24"></span>Hence again He showeth that they looked
not to the things of God, but that under this pretense they desired to
gratify private feeling, and were so far from doing this on account of
<span id="page_147">p. 147</span> <span id="iv.xliii-Page_147"></span>
His glory, that they preferred honor from men to that which cometh from
Him. How then were they likely to entertain  <span
id="fr_1136"></span>[1137](#fn_1136.md) such hostility towards Him  <span
id="fr_1137"></span>[1138](#fn_1137.md) for a kind of honor which they so
despised, as to prefer to it the honor which cometh from men?

<span id="iv.xliii-p27"></span>Having told them that they had not the
love of God, and having proved it by what was doing in His case, and by
what should be in the case of Antichrist, and having demonstrated that
they were deprived of all excuse, He next bringeth Moses to be their
accuser, going on to say,

<span id="iv.xliii-p28"></span> [John
5.45-47](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#045.md)<span
id="iv.xliii-p28.1"></span> . “Do not think that I will accuse you to
the Father; there is one that accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye
trust. For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed Me; for he
wrote of Me. But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe My
words?”

<span id="iv.xliii-p29"></span> What He saith is of this kind: “It is
Moses  <span id="fr_1138"></span>[1139](#fn_1138.md) who has been insulted
more than I  <span id="fr_1139"></span>[1140](#fn_1139.md) by your conduct
towards Me, for ye have disbelieved him rather than Me.” See how in
every way He hath cast them out from all excuse. “Ye said that ye loved
God when ye persecuted Me; I have shown that ye did so from hatred of
Him: ye say  <span id="fr_1140"></span>[1141](#fn_1140.md) that I break the
Sabbath and annul the Law; I have rid Me of this slander also: ye
maintain  <span id="fr_1141"></span>[1142](#fn_1141.md) that ye believe in
Moses by what ye dare to do against Me; I on the contrary show that this
is most to disbelieve in Moses; for so far am I from opposing the Law,
that he who shall accuse you is none other than the man who gave you the
Law.” As then He said of the Scriptures, in which “ye think ye have
eternal life,” so of Moses also He saith, “in whom ye trust”; everywhere
conquering them by their own weapons.

<span id="iv.xliii-p34"></span> “And whence,” saith some one, “is it
clear that Moses will accuse us, and that thou art not a boaster? What
hast thou to do with Moses? Thou hast broken the Sabbath which he
ordained that we should keep; how then should he accuse us? And how doth
it appear that we shall believe on another who cometh in his own name?
All these assertions thou makest without evidence.” Now in truth all
these points are proved above. “For” (Christ would reply) “since it is
acknowledged that I came from God, both by the works, by the voice of
John, and by the testimony of the Father, it is evident that Moses will
accuse the Jews.” For what saith he? “If a man come doing miracles and
leading you to God, and truly foretelling things future, ye must hearken
unto him with all readiness.” Now Christ had done all this. He wrought
miracles in very truth, He drew all men to God, and (so that He  <span
id="fr_1142"></span>[1143](#fn_1142) .md) caused accomplishment to follow
His predictions.  <span id="fr_1143"></span>[1144](#fn_1143.md)

<span id="iv.xliii-p37"></span> “But whence doth it appear that they
will believe another?” From their hating Christ, since they who turn
aside from Him who cometh according to the will of God will, it is quite
plain, receive the enemy of God. And marvel not if He now putteth
forward Moses, although He said, “I receive not witness from man,” for
He referreth them not to Moses, but to the Scriptures of God. However,
since the Scriptures terrified them less, He bringeth round His
discourse to the very person (of Moses), setting over against them their
Lawgiver as their accuser, thus rendering the terror more impressive;
 <span id="fr_1144"></span>[1145](#fn_1144.md) and each of their assertions
He refuteth. Observe: they said that they persecuted Him through love
for God, He showeth that they did so through hating God; they said that
they held fast to Moses, He showeth that they acted thus because they
believed not Moses. For had they been zealous for the law, they ought to
have received Him who fulfilled it; if they loved God they ought to have
believed One who drew them to Him, if they believed Moses they ought to
have done homage to One of whom Moses prophesied. “But” (saith Christ)
“if Moses is disbelieved before My coming, it is nothing unlikely that
I, who am heralded by him, should be driven away by you.” As then He had
shown from their conduct towards Himself that they who admired John
(really) despised him, so now He showeth that they who thought that they
believed Moses, believed him not, and turneth back on their own head all
that they thought to put forward in their own behalf. “So far,” He
saith, “am I from drawing you away from the Law, that I call your
Lawgiver himself to be your accuser.”

<span id="iv.xliii-p39"></span> That the Scriptures testified of Him He
declared, but where they testify He added not; desiring to inspire them
with greater awe, and to prompt them to search, and to reduce them to
the necessity of questioning. For had He told them readily and without
their questioning, they would have rejected the testimony; but now, if
they gave any heed to His words, they needed first of all to ask, and
learn from Him what that testimony was.  <span
id="fr_1145"></span>[1146](#fn_1145.md) On this account He dealeth the more
largely in assertions and threats, not in proofs only, that even so He
may bring them over by fear of what He saith; but they even so were
silent. Such a thing is wickedness; whatsoever a man say or do it is not
stirred to move, but remaineth keeping its peculiar venom.

<span id="iv.xliii-p41"></span> <span id="page_148">p. 148</span> <span
id="iv.xliii-Page_148"></span> Wherefore we must cast out all wickedness
from our souls, and never more contrive any deceit; for, saith one, “To
the perverse God sendeth crooked paths” ( [Prov. xxi.
8](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#008.md) <span id="iv.xliii-p41.1"></span> ,
LXX.); and, “The holy spirit of discipline  <span
id="fr_1146"></span>[1147](#fn_1146.md) will flee deceit, and remove from
thoughts that are without understanding.” ( [Wisd. i.
5](../../../bib/apo/wis001.htm#005) <span id="iv.xliii-p42.2"></span> ..md)
For nothing maketh men so foolish as wickedness; since when a man is
treacherous, unfair,  <span id="fr_1147"></span>[1148](#fn_1147.md)
ungrateful, (these are different forms of wickedness,) when without
having been wronged he grieves another, when he weaves deceits, how
shall he not exhibit an example of excessive folly? Again, nothing
maketh men so wise as virtue; it rendereth them thankful and
fair-minded, merciful, mild, gentle, and candid; it is wont to be the
mother of all other blessings. And what is more understanding than one
so disposed? for virtue is the very spring and root of prudence, just as
all wickedness hath its beginning in folly. For, the insolent man and
the angry become the prey of their respective passions from lack of
wisdom; on which account the prophet said, “There is no soundness in my
flesh: my wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness” ( [Ps.
38:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#003.md),
[4](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#004)<span id="iv.xliii-p43.3"></span> .md):
showing that all sin hath its beginning in folly: and so the virtuous
man who hath the fear of God is more understanding than any; wherefore a
wise man hath said, “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.” (
[Prov. i. 7](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#007.md) <span
id="iv.xliii-p43.4"></span> .) If then to fear God is to have wisdom,
and the wicked man hath not that fear, he is deprived of that which is
wisdom indeed;—and deprived of that which is wisdom indeed, he is more
foolish than any. And yet many admire the wicked as being able to do
injustice and harm, not knowing that they ought to deem them wretched
above all men, who thinking to injure others thrust the sword against
themselves;—an act of extremest folly, that a man should strike himself
and not even know that he doth so, but should think that he is injuring
another while he is killing himself. Wherefore Paul, knowing that we
slay ourselves when we smite others, saith, “Why do ye not rather take
wrong? Why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?” ( [1
Cor. vi. 7](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#007.md) <span
id="iv.xliii-p43.5"></span> .) For the not suffering wrong consists in
doing none, as also the not being ill-used in not using others ill;
though this assertion may seem a riddle to the many, and to those who
will not learn true wisdom. Knowing this, let us not call wretched or
lament for those who suffer injury or insult, but for such who inflict
these things; these are they who have been most injured, who have made
God to be at war with them, and have opened the mouths of ten thousand
accusers, who are getting an evil reputation in the present life, and
drawing down on themselves severe punishment in the life to come. While
those who have been wronged by them, and have nobly borne it all, have
God favorable to them, and all to condone with, and praise, and
entertain them. Such as these in the present life, shall enjoy an
exceeding good report, as affording the strongest example of true
wisdom, and in the life to come shall share the good things everlasting;
to which may we all attain through the grace and lovingkindness of our
Lord Jesus Christ, with whom to the Father and the Holy Ghost be glory,
now and ever, and world without end. Amen.
