<span id="iv.lxxx-p2"></span> <span id="iv.lxxx-p2.1"></span> <span
class="c1"><span id="iv.lxxx-p2.2"></span>[John xvi.
4-6](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#004.md)<span
id="iv.lxxx-p2.3"></span></span>

<span id="iv.lxxx-p3"></span>“These things I said not unto you at the
beginning, because I was with you. But now I go My way to Him that sent
Me; and none of you asketh Me, Whither goest Thou? But because I have
said these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart.”

<span id="iv.lxxx-p4"></span> \[1.\] <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.lxxx-p4.1"></span>Great</span> is the tyranny of despondency, and
much courage do we need so as to stand manfully against the feeling, and
after gathering from it what is useful, to let the superfluous go. It
hath somewhat useful; for when we ourselves or others sin, then only is
it good to grieve; but when we fall into human vicissitudes, then
despondency is useless. And now when it has overthrown the disciples who
were not yet perfect, see how Christ raiseth them again by His rebuke.
They who before this had asked Him ten thousand questions, (for Peter
said, “Whither goest Thou?” \[ [John
13.36](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#036.md)<span id="iv.lxxx-p4.2"></span>
\]; and Thomas, “We know not whither Thou goest, and how can we know the
way?” \[ [John 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#005.md),
[8](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#008.md)<span id="iv.lxxx-p4.3"></span> \];
and Philip, “Show us Thy Father”;) these men, I say, now hearing, “they
will put you out of the synagogues,” and “will hate you,” and “whosoever
killeth you will think that he doeth God service,” were so cast down as
to be struck dumb, so that they spake nothing to Him. This then He
maketh a reproach to them, and saith, “These things I said not unto you
at the beginning, because I was with you; but now I go unto Him that
sent Me, and none of you asketh Me, Whither goest Thou? but because I
have said these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart.” For a
dreadful thing is immoderate sorrow, dreadful and effective of death.
Wherefore Paul said, “Lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up by
overmuch sorrow.” ( [2 Cor. ii. 7](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#007.md)
<span id="iv.lxxx-p4.4"></span> .)

<span id="iv.lxxx-p5"></span>“And these things,” saith He, “I told you
not at the beginning.” Why did He not tell them at the beginning? That
none might say that He spake guessing from the ordinary course of
events. And why did He enter on a matter of such unpleasantness? “I knew
these things,” He saith, “from the beginning, and spake not of them; not
because I did not know them, but ‘because I was with you.’” And this
again was spoken after a human manner, as though He had said, “Because
ye were in safety, and it was in your power to question Me when ye
would, and all the storm blew upon Me, and it was superfluous to tell
you these things at the beginning.” “But did He not tell them this? Did
He not call the twelve, and say unto them, ‘Ye shall be brought before
governors and kings for My sake,’ and, ‘they shall scourge you in the
synagogues’? ( [Matt. 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#018.md),
[17](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#017)<span id="iv.lxxx-p5.1"></span> .md).
How then saith He, ‘I told you not at the beginning’?” Because He had
proclaimed before the scourgings and bringing before princes, still not
that their death should appear so desirable that the action should even
be deemed a service to God. For this more than anything was suited to
terrify them, that they were to be judged as impious and corrupters.
This too may be said, that in that place He spake of what they should
suffer from the Gentiles, but here He hath added in a stronger way the
acts of the Jews also, and told them that it was at their doors.

<span id="page_285">p. 285</span> <span id="iv.lxxx-Page_285"></span>

<span id="iv.lxxx-p6"></span> “But now I go to Him that sent Me, and no
man of you saith, Whither goest Thou? But because I have said these
things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart.” It was no slight
comfort to them to learn that He knew the excess of their despondency.
For they were beside themselves from the anguish caused by their being
left by Him, and from their awaiting the terrible things which were to
come, since they knew not whether they should be able to bear them
manfully. “Why then after this did He not tell them that they had been
vouchsafed the Spirit?” That thou mightest learn that they were
exceedingly virtuous. For if, when they had not yet been vouchsafed the
Spirit, they started not back, though overwhelmed with sorrow, consider
what sort of men they were likely to be after having enjoyed the grace.
 <span id="fr_2223"></span>[2224](#fn_2223.md) If they had heard this at
that time, and so had endured, we should have attributed the whole to
the Spirit, but now it is entirely the fruit of their own state of mind,
it is a clear manifestation of their love for Christ, who applieth a
touchstone to their mind as yet defenseless.

<span id="iv.lxxx-p8"></span> [John
16.7](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#007.md)<span id="iv.lxxx-p8.1"></span> .
“But I tell you the truth.”  <span id="fr_2224"></span>[2225](#fn_2224.md)

<span id="iv.lxxx-p10"></span>Observe how He consoleth them again. “I
speak not,” He saith, “to please you, and although you be grieved ten
thousand fold, yet must ye hear what is for your good; it is indeed to
your liking that I should be with you, but what is expedient for you is
different. And it is the part of one caring for others, not to be over
gentle with his friends in matters which concern their interests, or to
lead them away from what is good for them.”

<span id="iv.lxxx-p11"></span> “For if I go not away, the Comforter will
not come.”  <span id="fr_2225"></span>[2226](#fn_2225.md)

<span id="iv.lxxx-p13"></span>What here say those who hold not the
fitting opinion concerning the Spirit? Is it “expedient” that the master
depart, and the servant come? Seest thou how great is the honor of the
Spirit?

<span id="iv.lxxx-p14"></span>“But if I depart, I will send Him unto
you.” And what the gain?

<span id="iv.lxxx-p15"></span> [John
16.8](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#008.md)<span id="iv.lxxx-p15.1"></span> .
“He, when He is come, will reprove  <span
id="fr_2226"></span>[2227](#fn_2226.md) the world.”  <span
id="fr_2227"></span>[2228](#fn_2227.md)

<span id="iv.lxxx-p18"></span>That is, “they shall not do these things
unpunished if He come. For indeed, the things that have been already
done, are sufficient to stop their mouths; but when these things are
also done by Him, when doctrines are more perfect and miracles greater,
much more shall they be condemned when they see such things done in My
Name, which make the proof of the Resurrection more certain. For now
they are able to say, ‘this is the carpenter’s son, whose father and
mother we know’; but when they see the bands of death loosed, wickedness
cast out, natural lameness straightened, devils expelled, abundant
supply of the Spirit, and all this effected by My being called on, what
will they say? The Father hath borne witness of Me, and the Spirit will
bear witness also.” Yet He bare witness at the beginning. Yea, and shall
also do it now. But the, “will convince,”

<span id="iv.lxxx-p19"></span> [John
16.9](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#009.md)<span id="iv.lxxx-p19.1"></span> .
“Of sin.”  <span id="fr_2228"></span>[2229](#fn_2228.md)

<span id="iv.lxxx-p21"></span>This meaneth, “will cut off all their
excuses, and show that they have transgressed unpardonably.”

<span id="iv.lxxx-p22"></span> [John
16.10](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#010.md)<span id="iv.lxxx-p22.1"></span>
. “Of righteousness, because I go to the  <span
id="fr_2229"></span>[2230](#fn_2229.md) Father, and ye see Me no more.”

<span id="iv.lxxx-p24"></span> That is, “I have exhibited a blameless
 <span id="fr_2230"></span>[2231](#fn_2230.md) life, and this is the proof,
that, ‘I go to the Father.’” For since they continually urged this
against Him, that He was not from God, and therefore called Him a sinner
and transgressor, He saith, that the Spirit shall take from them this
excuse also. “For if My being deemed not to be from God, showeth Me to
be a transgressor, when the Spirit shall have shown that I am gone
thither, not merely for a season, but to abide there, (for the, ‘Ye see
Me no more,’ is the expression of one declaring this,) what will they
say then?” Observe how by these two things, their evil suspicion is
removed; since neither doth working miracles belong to a sinner, (for a
sinner cannot work them,) nor doth the being with God continually belong
to a sinner. “So that ye can  <span id="fr_2231"></span>[2232](#fn_2231.md)
no longer say, that ‘this man is a sinner,’ that ‘this man is not from
God.’”

<span id="iv.lxxx-p27"></span> [John
16.11](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#011.md)<span id="iv.lxxx-p27.1"></span>
. “Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged.”

<span id="iv.lxxx-p28"></span> Here again He mooteth the argument
concerning righteousness, that He had overthrown His opponent. Now had
He been a sinner, He could not have overthrown him; a thing which not
even any just man had been strong enough to do. “But that he hath been
condemned through Me, they shall know who trample on him hereafter, and
who clearly know My Resurrection, which is the mark of Him who
condemneth him. For he was not able to hold Me. And whereas they said
that I had a devil, and that I was a deceiver, these things also shall
hereafter appear to be false;  <span
id="fr_2232"></span>[2233](#fn_2232.md) for I could not have prevailed
against him, had I been subject to sin; but now he is condemned and cast
out.”

<span id="iv.lxxx-p30"></span>\[2.\] [John
16.12](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#012.md)<span id="iv.lxxx-p30.1"></span>
. “I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.”

<span id="iv.lxxx-p31"></span>“Therefore it is expedient for you that I
depart, if ye then will bear them when I departed.” “And what hath come
to pass? Is the Spirit greater than Thou, that now indeed <span
id="page_286">p. 286</span> <span id="iv.lxxx-Page_286"></span> we bear
not, but It will fit us to bear? Is It working more powerful and more
perfect?” “Not so; for He too shall speak My words.” Wherefore He saith,

<span id="iv.lxxx-p32"></span> [John
16.13-15](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#013.md)<span
id="iv.lxxx-p32.1"></span> .  <span id="fr_2233"></span>[2234](#fn_2233.md)
“He shall not speak of Himself; but whatsoever He shall hear, that shall
He speak; and He will show you things to come. He shall glorify Me; for
He shall receive of Mine, and shall show it unto you. All things that
the Father hath are Mine.”  <span id="fr_2234"></span>[2235](#fn_2234.md)

<span id="iv.lxxx-p35"></span>For since He had told them, that “‘He
shall teach you, and bring to your remembrance’ ( [John
14.26](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#026.md)<span id="iv.lxxx-p35.1"></span>
), and shall comfort you in your afflictions,” (which He Himself did
not,) and that “it is expedient for you that I should depart” ( [John
16.7](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#007.md)<span id="iv.lxxx-p35.2"></span>
), and that He should come, and, “‘now ye are not able to bear’ ( [John
16.12](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#012.md)<span id="iv.lxxx-p35.3"></span>
), but then ye shall be able,” and, that “He shall lead you into all
truth” ( [John 16.13](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#013.md)<span
id="iv.lxxx-p35.4"></span> ); lest hearing these things they should
suppose the Spirit to be the greater, and so fall into an extreme
opinion of impiety, therefore He saith, “He shall receive of Mine,” that
is, “whatsoever things I have told you, He shall also tell you.” When He
saith, “He shall speak nothing of Himself,” He meaneth, “nothing
contrary, nothing of His own opposed to My words.” As then in saying
respecting Himself, “I speak not of Myself” ( [John
14.10](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#010.md)<span id="iv.lxxx-p35.5"></span>
), He meaneth that He speaketh nothing beside what the Father saith,
nothing of His own against Him, or differing from Him, so also with
respect to the Spirit. But the, “of Mine,” meaneth, “of what I know,”
“of My own knowledge”; “for the knowledge of Me and of the Spirit is
one.”

<span id="iv.lxxx-p36"></span> “And He will tell you things to come.” He
excited their minds, for the race of man is for nothing so greedy,
 <span id="fr_2235"></span>[2236](#fn_2235.md) as for learning the future.
This, for instance, they continually asked Him, “Whither goest Thou?”
“Which is the way?” To free them therefore from this anxiety, He saith,
“He shall foretell you all things, so that ye shall not meet with them
without warning.”

<span id="iv.lxxx-p38"></span>“He shall glorify Me.” How? “In My name He
shall grant His inward workings.” For since at the coming of the Spirit
they were about to do greater miracles, therefore, again introducing the
Equality of Honor, He saith, “He shall glorify Me.”

<span id="iv.lxxx-p39"></span>What meaneth He by, “all truth”? for this
also He testifieth of Him, that “He shall guide us into all truth.” (
[John 16.13](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#013.md)<span
id="iv.lxxx-p39.1"></span> .) Because He was clothed with the flesh, and
because He would not seem to speak concerning Himself, and because they
did not yet know clearly concerning the Resurrection, and were too
imperfect, and also because of the Jews, that they might not think they
were punishing Him as a transgressor; therefore He spake no great thing
continually, nor plainly drew them away from the Law. But when the
disciples were cut off from them,  <span
id="fr_2236"></span>[2237](#fn_2236.md) and were for the future without;
and when many were about to believe, and to be released from their sins;
and when there were others who spake of Him, He with good reason spake
not great things concerning Himself. “So that it proceeded not from
ignorance of Mine,” He saith, “that I told you not what I should have
told you, but from the infirmity of the hearers.” On this account having
said, “He shall lead you into all truth,” He added, “He shall not speak
of Himself.” For to show that the Spirit needeth not teaching, hear Paul
saying, “So also the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of
God.” ( [1 Cor. ii. 11](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#011.md) <span
id="iv.lxxx-p40.2"></span> .) “As then the spirit of man, not learning
from another, knoweth; so also the Holy Spirit ‘shall receive of Mine,’”
that is, “shall speak in unison with what is Mine.”

<span id="iv.lxxx-p41"></span>“All things that the Father hath are
Mine.” “Since then those things are Mine, and He shall speak from the
things of the Father, He shall speak from Mine.”

<span id="iv.lxxx-p42"></span>\[3.\] “But why did not the Spirit come
before He departed?” Because the curse not having yet been taken away,
sin not yet loosed, but all being yet subject to vengeance, He could not
come. “It is necessary then,” saith He, “that the enmity be put away,
that we be reconciled to God, and then receive that Gift.” But why saith
He, “I will send Him”? ( [John
16.7](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#007.md)<span id="iv.lxxx-p42.1"></span>
.) It meaneth, “I will prepare you beforehand to receive Him.” For, how
can that which Is everywhere, be “sent”? Besides, He also showeth the
distinction of the Persons. On these two accounts He thus speaketh; and
also, since they were hardly to be drawn away from Himself, exhorting
them to hold fast to the Spirit, and in order that they might cherish
It. For He Himself was able to have wrought these things, but He
concedeth to the Spirit  <span id="fr_2237"></span>[2238](#fn_2237.md) the
working of miracles,  <span id="fr_2238"></span>[2239](#fn_2238.md) on this
account, that they might understand His  <span
id="fr_2239"></span>[2240](#fn_2239.md) dignity. For as the Father could
have brought into being things which are, yet the Son did so, that we
might understand His power, so also is it in this case. On this account
He Himself was made Flesh, reserving the inward working  <span
id="fr_2240"></span>[2241](#fn_2240.md) for the Spirit, shutting up the
mouths of those who take the argument of His ineffable love for an
occasion of impiety. For when they say that the Son was made flesh
because He was inferior to the Father, we will reply to them, “what then
will ye say of the Spirit?” He took not the flesh, and yet certainly on
this account <span id="page_287">p. 287</span> <span
id="iv.lxxx-Page_287"></span> ye will not call Him greater than the Son,
nor the Son inferior to Him. Therefore, in the case of baptism also the
Trinity is included. The Father is able to effect the whole, as is the
Son, and the Holy Ghost; yet, since concerning the Father no man doubts,
but the doubt was concerning the Son, and the Holy Ghost, They are
included in the rite, that by Their community in supplying those
unspeakable blessings, we may also fully learn Their community in
dignity. For that both the Son is able by Himself to do that which in
the case of baptism  <span id="fr_2241"></span>[2242](#fn_2241.md) He is
able to do with the Father, and the Holy Ghost the same, hear these
things said plainly. For to the Jews He said, “That ye may know that the
Son of Man hath power on earth to forgive sins” ( [Mark ii.
10](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#010) <span id="iv.lxxx-p47.6"></span> .md);
and again, “That ye may become children of light” ( [John
12.36](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#036.md)<span id="iv.lxxx-p47.7"></span>
): and, “I give to them eternal life.” ( [John
10.28](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#028.md)<span id="iv.lxxx-p47.8"></span>
.) Then after this, “That they might have life, and might have it more
abundantly.” ( [John 10.10](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#010.md)<span
id="iv.lxxx-p47.9"></span> .) Now let us see the Spirit also performing
the same thing. Where can we see it? “But the manifestation of the
Spirit,” it saith, “is given to every man to profit withal” ( [1 Cor.
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#007.md), [John
6:63](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#063.md)<span id="iv.lxxx-p47.10"></span>
); He then that giveth these things, much more remitteth sins. And
again, “It is the Spirit that quickeneth”; and, “Shall quicken you
 <span id="fr_2242"></span>[2243](#fn_2242.md) by His Spirit which dwelleth
in you” ( [Rom. viii. 11](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#011.md) <span
id="iv.lxxx-p48.3"></span> ); and, “The Spirit is Life because of
righteousness” ( [Rom. viii. 10](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#010.md) <span
id="iv.lxxx-p48.4"></span> ); and, “If ye are led by the Spirit, ye are
not under the Law.” ( [Gal. v. 18](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#018.md)
<span id="iv.lxxx-p48.5"></span> .) “For ye have not received the Spirit
of bondage again to fear, but ye have received the Spirit of adoption.”
( [Rom. viii. 15](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#015.md) <span
id="iv.lxxx-p48.6"></span> .) All the wonders too which they then
wrought, they wrought at the coming of the Spirit. And Paul writing to
the Corinthians, said, “But ye have been washed, but ye have been
sanctified in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,  <span
id="fr_2243"></span>[2244](#fn_2243.md) and by the Spirit of our God.” ( [1
Cor. vi. 11](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#011.md) <span
id="iv.lxxx-p49.3"></span> .) Since then they had heard many things of
the Father, and had seen the Son work many things, but as yet knew
nothing clearly of the Spirit, that Spirit doeth miracles, and bringeth
in the perfect knowledge. But (as I said before) that He may not thence
be supposed to be greater, on this account Christ saith, “Whatsoever He
shall hear, that shall He speak; and He will show you things to come.”
Since, if this be not so, how could it be otherwise than absurd, if He
was about to hear then, and on account of those who were being made
disciples? For according to you,  <span
id="fr_2244"></span>[2245](#fn_2244.md) He would not even then know, except
on account of those who were about to hear. What could be more unlawful
than this saying? Besides, what would He have to hear? Did He not speak
 <span id="fr_2245"></span>[2246](#fn_2245.md) all these things by the
Prophets? For if He was about to teach concerning the dissolution of the
Law, it had been spoken of: if concerning Christ, His Divinity and the
Dispensation, these had been spoken of also. What could He say more
clearly after this?

<span id="iv.lxxx-p52"></span> “And shall show you things to come.” Here
most of all Christ showeth His  <span
id="fr_2246"></span>[2247](#fn_2246.md) Dignity, for to foretell things to
come is especially the property of God. Now if He  <span
id="fr_2247"></span>[2248](#fn_2247.md) also learn this from others, He
will have nothing more than the Prophets, but here Christ declareth a
knowledge brought into exact accordance with God, that it is impossible
that He should speak anything else. But the, “shall receive of Mine,”
meaneth, “shall receive, either of the grace  <span
id="fr_2248"></span>[2249](#fn_2248.md) which came into My Flesh, or of the
knowledge which I also have, not as needing it, nor as learning it from
another, but because it is One and the same.” “And wherefore spake He
thus, and not otherwise?” Because they understand not yet the word
concerning the Spirit, wherefore He provideth for one thing only, that
the Spirit should be believed and received by them, and that they should
not be offended. For since He had said, “One is your Teacher, even
Christ” ( [Matt. xxiii. 10](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#010.md) <span
id="iv.lxxx-p55.2"></span> ), that they might not deem that they should
disobey Him in obeying the Spirit, He saith, “His teaching and Mine are
One; of what I should have taught, of those things shall He also speak.
Do not suppose His words are other than Mine, for those words are Mine,
and confirm My opinion.  <span id="fr_2249"></span>[2250](#fn_2249.md) For
One is the will of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.”
Thus also He willeth us to be, when He saith, “That they may be one, as
Thou and I are One.”  <span id="fr_2250"></span>[2251](#fn_2250.md) ( [John
17.11](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#011.md)<span id="iv.lxxx-p57.3"></span>
.)

<span id="iv.lxxx-p58"></span> \[4.\] There is nothing equal to
unanimity and concord; for so one is manifold. If two or ten are of one
mind, the one is one no longer, but each one is multiplied tenfold, and
thou wilt find the one in the ten, and the ten in the one; and if they
have an enemy, he who attacks the one, as having attacked the ten, is
vanquished; for he is the mark not for one, but for ten opponents.
 <span id="fr_2251"></span>[2252](#fn_2251.md) Is one in want? No, he is
not in want, for he is wealthy in his greater part, that is, in the
nine; and the needy part, the lesser, is concealed by the wealthy part,
the greater. Each of these hath twenty hands, twenty eyes, and as many
feet. For he sees not with his own eyes alone, but with those of others;
he walks  <span id="fr_2252"></span>[2253](#fn_2252.md) not with his own
feet alone, but with those of others; he works not with his own hands
alone, but with theirs. He hath ten souls, for not only doth he take
thought for himself, but those souls also for <span id="page_288">p.
288</span> <span id="iv.lxxx-Page_288"></span> him. And if they be made
a hundred, it will still be the same, and their power will be extended.
Seest thou the excess of love, how it makes the one both irresistible
and manifold, how one can even be in many places, the same both in
Persia and in Rome, and that what nature cannot do, love can? for one
part of him will be here, and one there, or rather he will be wholly
here and wholly there. If then he have a thousand or two thousand
friends, consider again whither his power will extend. Seest thou what
an increase-giving thing is love? for the wonderful thing is this, its
making one a thousand. Why then do we not acquire this power and place
ourselves in safety? This is better than all power or riches,  <span
id="fr_2253"></span>[2254](#fn_2253.md) this is more than health, than
light itself, it is the groundwork of good courage. How long do we set
our love on one or two? Consider also the action in the contrary way.
Suppose a man without a friend, a mark of the utmost folly, (for a fool
will say, “I have no friend,”) what sort of life will such a one lead?
For though he be infinitely rich, in plenty and luxury, possessed of ten
thousand good things, yet is he desolate and bare of all. But in the
case of friends not so; though they be poor men, yet are they better
provided than the wealthy; and the things which a man undertakes not to
say for himself, a friend will say for him, and whatever gratifications
he is not able to procure for himself, he will be enabled to obtain by
means of another, and much more; and it will be to us the groundwork of
all enjoyment and safety, since one who is guarded by so many spearmen
cannot suffer harm. For the king’s body guards are not equal in their
strictness to these. The one perform their watch through compulsion and
fear, the others through kindness and love; and love is far mightier
than fear. The king fears his own guards; the friend is more confident
in them than in himself, and by reason of them fears none of those that
plot against him. Let us then engage in this traffic; the poor man, that
he may have consolation in his poverty; the rich, that he may possess
his wealth in safety; the ruler, that he may rule with safety;  <span
id="fr_2254"></span>[2255](#fn_2254.md) the ruled, that he may have
benevolent rulers. This is the source of kindness, this the groundwork
of gentleness; since even among beasts, those are the most fierce and
untamable which are not gregarious. For this cause we dwell in cities,
and have public places, that we may converse with one another. This also
Paul commanded, saying, “Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves
together” ( [Heb. x. 25](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#025.md) <span
id="iv.lxxx-p62.5"></span> ); for no evil is so great as solitariness,
and the state which is without compact and intercourse. “What then,”
saith some one, “of the solitaries, and of those who have occupied the
summits of the mountains?” That neither are they without friends; they
have indeed fled from the turmoil of common life, but they have many of
one soul with them, and closely bound together one to another; and they
have retired that they might rightly accomplish this thing.  <span
id="fr_2255"></span>[2256](#fn_2255.md) For since the rivalry of business
causes many disputes, therefore, removing from among men, they cultivate
 <span id="fr_2256"></span>[2257](#fn_2256.md) love with much exactness.
“But how,” saith some one, “if a man be alone can he have ten thousand
friends?” I, for my part, desire, if it be possible, that men should
know how to dwell one with another; but for the present let the
properties of friendship remain unshaken.  <span
id="fr_2257"></span>[2258](#fn_2257.md) For it is not place which makes
friends. They, for instance, have many who admire them; now these would
not have admired had they not loved them. Again, they pray for all the
world, which is the greatest proof of friendship. For this cause we
salute one another at the Mysteries, that being many we may become one;
and in the case of the uninitiated,  <span
id="fr_2258"></span>[2259](#fn_2258.md) we make our prayers common,
supplicating for the sick, and for the produce of the world, for land
and sea. Seest thou all the power of love? in the prayers, in the
Mysteries, in the exhortations? This is that which causeth all good
things. If we hold carefully to this, we shall both rightly dispense
things present, and also obtain the Kingdom; which may we all obtain
through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom
and with whom, to the Father and the Holy Ghost, be glory, for ever and
ever. Amen.
