class="c1"><span id="iv.xxxv-p2.2"></span>[John
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#021.md),

id="iv.xxxv-p2.3"></span></span>

<span id="iv.xxxv-p3"></span>“Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe Me,
the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at
Jerusalem, worship the Father. Ye worship ye know not what; we know what
we worship, for salvation is of the Jews.”

<span id="iv.xxxv-p4"></span> \[1.\] <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.xxxv-p4.1"></span>Everywhere</span> , beloved, we have need of
faith, faith the mother of blessings, the medicine of salvation; and
without this it is impossible to possess any one of the great doctrines.
Without this, men are like to those who attempt to cross  <span
id="fr_856"></span>[857](#fn_856.md) the open sea without a ship, who for a
little way hold out by swimming, using both hands and feet, but when
they have advanced farther, are quickly swamped by the waves: in like
manner they who use their own reasonings, before they have learnt
anything, suffer shipwreck; as also Paul saith, “Who concerning faith
have made shipwreck.” ( [1 Tim. i. 19](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#019.md)
<span id="iv.xxxv-p5.6"></span> .) That this be not our case, let us
hold fast the sacred anchor by which Christ bringeth over the Samaritan
woman now. For when she had said, “How say ye  <span
id="fr_857"></span>[858](#fn_857.md) that Jerusalem is the place in which
men ought to worship?” Christ replied, “Believe Me, woman, that the hour
cometh, when ye shall neither in Jerusalem, nor yet in this mountain,
worship the Father.” An exceedingly great  <span
id="fr_858"></span>[859](#fn_858.md) doctrine He revealed to her, and one
which He did not mention either to Nicodemus or Nathanael. She was eager
to prove her own privileges more honorable than those of the Jews; and
this she subtly argued from the Fathers, but Christ met not this
question. For it was for the time distracting  <span
id="fr_859"></span>[860](#fn_859.md) to speak on the matter, and to show
why the Fathers worshiped in the mountain, and why the Jews at
Jerusalem. Wherefore on this point He was silent, and having taken away
from both places priority in dignity, rouses her soul by showing that
neither Jews nor Samaritans possessed anything great in comparison with
that which was to be given; and then He introduceth the difference. Yet
even thus He declared that the Jews were more honorable, not preferring
place to place, but giving them the precedence because of their
intention. As though He had said, “About the ‘place’ of worship ye have
no need henceforth to dispute, but in the ‘manner’ the Jews have an
advantage over you Samaritans, for ‘ye,’ He saith, ‘worship ye know not
what; we know what we worship.’”

<span id="iv.xxxv-p9"></span>How then did the Samaritans “know not” what
they worshiped? Because they thought that God was local and partial; so
at least they served Him, and so they sent to the Persians, and reported
that “the God of this place is wroth with us” ( 2 Kings xxvi <span
id="iv.xxxv-p9.1"></span> .), in this respect forming no higher opinion
of Him than of their idols. Wherefore they continued to serve both Him
and devils, joining things which ought not to be joined. The Jews, on
the contrary, were free from this supposition, at least the greater part
of them, and knew that He was God of the world. Therefore He saith, “Ye
worship ye know not what; we know what we worship.” Do not wonder that
He numbereth Himself among Jews, for He speaketh to the woman’s opinion
of Him as though He were a Jewish Prophet, and therefore He putteth, “we
worship.” For that He is of the objects of worship is clear to every
one, because to worship belongs to the creature, but to be worshiped to
the Lord of the creature. But for a time He speaketh as a Jew; and the
expression “we” in this place meaneth “we Jews.” Having then exalted
what was Jewish, He next maketh Himself credible, and persuadeth the
woman to give the greater heed to His words, by rendering His discourse
above suspicion, and showing that He doth not exalt what belongs to them
by reason of relationship  <span id="fr_860"></span>[861](#fn_860.md) to
those of His own tribe. For it is clear, that one who had made these
declarations concerning the place on which the Jews most prided
themselves, and thought that they were superior to all, and who had
taken away their high claims, would not after this  <span
id="fr_861"></span>[862](#fn_861.md) speak to get favor of any, but with
truth and prophetic power. When therefore He had for a while removed her
from such reasonings,  <span id="fr_862"></span>[863](#fn_862.md) say <span
id="page_115">p. 115</span> <span id="iv.xxxv-Page_115"></span> ing,
“Woman, believe Me,” and what follows, then He addeth, “for salvation is
of the Jews.” What He saith is of this kind: neither, that blessings to
the world came from them, (for to know God and condemn idols had its
beginning from them, and with you the very act of worship, although ye
do it not rightly, yet received its origin from them,) or else, He
speaketh of His own Coming. Or rather, one would not be wrong in calling
both these things “salvation” which He said was “of the Jews”; which
Paul implied when he said, “Of whom is Christ according to the flesh,
who is God over all.” ( [Rom. ix. 5](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#005.md)
<span id="iv.xxxv-p12.3"></span> .) Seest thou how He commendeth  <span
id="fr_863"></span>[864](#fn_863.md) the old Covenant, and showeth that it
is the root of blessings, and that He is throughout not opposed to the
Law, since He maketh the groundwork  <span
id="fr_864"></span>[865](#fn_864.md) of all good things to come from the
Jews?

<span id="iv.xxxv-p15"></span> [John
4.23](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#023.md)<span id="iv.xxxv-p15.1"></span> .
“But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshipers shall worship
the Father.”

<span id="iv.xxxv-p16"></span>“We, O woman,” He saith, “excel you in the
manner of our worship, but even this shall henceforth have an end. Not
the places only, but even the manner of serving God shall be changed.
And this change is at your very doors. ‘For the hour cometh, and now
is.’”

<span id="iv.xxxv-p17"></span> \[2.\] For since what the Prophets said
they said long before the event, to show that here it is not so,  <span
id="fr_865"></span>[866](#fn_865.md) He saith, “And now is.” Think not, He
saith, that this is a prophecy of such a kind as shall be accomplished
after a long time, the fulfillment is already at hand and at your very
doors, “when the true worshipers shall worship the Father in spirit and
in truth.” In saying “true,”  <span id="fr_866"></span>[867](#fn_866.md) He
excludeth Jews as well as Samaritans; for although the Jews be better
than the Samaritans, yet are they far inferior to those that shall come,
as inferior as is the type to the reality. But He speaketh of the
Church, that she  <span id="fr_867"></span>[868](#fn_867.md) is the “true”
worship, and such as is meet for God.

<span id="iv.xxxv-p21"></span>“For the Father seeketh such to worship
Him.”

<span id="iv.xxxv-p22"></span> If then He in times past sought such as
these, He allowed to those others their way of worship, not willingly,
 <span id="fr_868"></span>[869](#fn_868.md) but from condescension, and for
this reason,  <span id="fr_869"></span>[870](#fn_869.md) that He might
bring them in also. Who then are “the true worshipers”? Those who
confine not their service by place, and who serve God in spirit; as Paul
saith, “Whom I serve in my spirit  <span
id="fr_870"></span>[871](#fn_870.md) in the Gospel of His Son”: and again,
“I beseech you that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice,
acceptable unto God, your reasonable service.” ( [Rom.
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#009.md), [Rom.
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#001.md)<span id="iv.xxxv-p25.4"></span>
.) But when he saith,

<span id="iv.xxxv-p26"></span> [John
4.24](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#024.md)<span id="iv.xxxv-p26.1"></span> .
“God is a Spirit” \[God is spirit\]. He declareth nothing else than His
incorporeal Nature. Now the service of that which is incorporeal must
needs be of the same character, and must be offered by that in us which
is incorporeal, to wit, the soul, and purity of mind. Wherefore He
saith, “they that worship Him, must worship Him in spirit and in truth.”
For because both Samaritans and Jews were careless about the soul, but
took great pains about the body, cleansing it in divers ways, it is not,
He saith, by purity of body, but by that which is incorporeal in us,
namely the mind, that the incorporeal One is served. Sacrifice then not
sheep and calves, but dedicate thyself to the Lord; make thyself a
holocaust, this is to offer a living sacrifice. Ye must worship “in
truth ”  <span id="fr_871"></span>[872](#fn_871.md) ; as former things were
types, such as circumcision, and whole burnt offerings, and victims, and
incense, they now no longer exist, but all is “truth.” For a man must
now circumcise not his flesh, but his evil thoughts, and crucify
himself, and remove and slay his unreasonable desires.” The woman was
made dizzy by His discourse, and fainted  <span
id="fr_872"></span>[873](#fn_872.md) in at the sublimity of what He said,
and, in her trouble, hear what she saith:

<span id="iv.xxxv-p29"></span> [John
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#025.md),
[26](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#026.md)<span id="iv.xxxv-p29.1"></span> .
“I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when He is come, He
will tell us all things. Jesus saith unto her, I am that speak unto
thee.”

<span id="iv.xxxv-p30"></span> And whence came the Samaritans to expect
the coming of Christ, seeing that they received Moses only?  <span
id="fr_873"></span>[874](#fn_873.md) From the writings of Moses themselves.
For even in the beginning He revealed the Son. “Let Us make man in Our
Image, after Our Likeness” ( [Gen. i.
26](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#026) <span id="iv.xxxv-p31.4"></span> .md),
was said to the Son. It was He who talked with Abraham in the tent. (
[Gen. xviii](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#000.md) <span
id="iv.xxxv-p31.5"></span> .) And Jacob prophesying concerning Him said,
“A ruler shall not fail from Judah, nor a leader from his thighs, until
He come for whom it is reserved,  <span
id="fr_874"></span>[875](#fn_874.md) and He is the expectation of nations.”
( [Gen. xviii](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#000.md) <span
id="iv.xxxv-p32.3"></span> .) And Moses himself saith, “The Lord thy God
will raise up unto you a Prophet of your brethren like unto me, unto Him
shall ye hearken.” ( [Deut. xviii. 15](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#015.md)
<span id="iv.xxxv-p32.4"></span> .) And the circumstances attending the
serpent, and the rod of Moses, and Isaac, and the sheep, and many other
things they who chose might select as proclaiming His coming.

<span id="iv.xxxv-p33"></span>“And why, pray,” saith one, “did not
Christ lead on the woman by these means? why did He instance the serpent
to Nicodemus, and <span id="page_116">p. 116</span> <span
id="iv.xxxv-Page_116"></span> mention prophecy to Nathanael, but to her
say nothing of the kind? For what reason, and why?” Because they were
men, and were versed in these things, she a poor ignorant woman
unpracticed in the Scriptures. Wherefore He doth not speak to her from
them, but draweth her on by the “water” and by prophecy, and bringeth
her to make mention of Christ and then revealeth Himself; which had He
at first told the woman when she had not questioned Him, He would have
seemed to her to trifle and talk idly, while as it is by bringing her
little by little to mention Him, at a fitting time He revealed Himself.
To the Jews, who continually said, “How long dost Thou make us to doubt?
tell us if Thou art the Christ” ( [John
10.24](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#024.md)<span id="iv.xxxv-p33.1"></span>
), to them  <span id="fr_875"></span>[876](#fn_875.md) He gave no clear
answer, but to this woman He said plainly, that <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.xxxv-p34.3"></span>He is</span> . For the woman was more
fair-minded than the Jews; they did not enquire to learn, but always to
mock at Him, for had they desired to learn, the teaching which was by
His words, and by the Scriptures, and by His miracles would have been
sufficient. The woman, on the contrary, said what she said from an
impartial judgment and a simple mind, as is plain from what she did
afterwards; for she both heard and believed, and netted  <span
id="fr_876"></span>[877](#fn_876.md) others also, and in every circumstance
we may observe the carefulness and faith of the woman.

<span id="iv.xxxv-p36"></span> [John
4.27](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#027.md)<span id="iv.xxxv-p36.1"></span> .
“And upon this came His disciples,” (very seasonably did they come when
the teaching was finished,) “and marveled that He talked with the woman,
yet no man said, What seekest Thou? or, Why talkest Thou with her?”

<span id="iv.xxxv-p37"></span>\[3.\] At what did they marvel? At His
want of pride and exceeding humility, that looked upon as He was, He
endured with such lowliness of heart to talk with a woman poor, and a
Samaritan. Still in their amazement they did not ask Him the reason, so
well were they taught to keep the station of disciples, so much did they
fear and reverence Him. For although they did not as yet hold the right
opinion concerning Him, still they gave heed unto Him as to some
marvelous one, and paid Him much respect. Yet they frequently are seen
to act confidently; as when John lay upon His bosom, when they came to
Him and said, “Who is the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven?” ( [Matt.
xviii. 1](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#001.md) <span
id="iv.xxxv-p37.1"></span> ), when the sons of Zebedee entreated Him to
set one of them on His right hand, and the other on His left. Why then
did they not here question Him? Because since all those instances
related to themselves, they had need to enquire into them, while what
here took place was of no such great importance to them. And indeed John
did that a long time after towards the very end, when He enjoyed greater
confidence, and was bold in the love of Christ; for he it was,  <span
id="fr_877"></span>[878](#fn_877.md) he saith, “whom Jesus loved.” What
could equal such blessedness?

<span id="iv.xxxv-p39"></span> But, beloved, let us not stop at this,
the calling the Apostle blessed, but let us do all things that we also
may be of the blessed, let us imitate the Evangelist, and see what it
was that caused such great love. What then was it? He left his father,
his ship, and his net, and followed Jesus. Yet this he did in common
with his brother, and Peter, and Andrew, and the rest of the Apostles.
What then was the special  <span id="fr_878"></span>[879](#fn_878.md) thing
which caused this great love? Shall we discover it? He saith nothing of
this kind about himself, but only that he was beloved; as to the
righteous acts for which he was beloved he has modestly been silent.
That Jesus loved him with an especial love was clear to every one; yet
John doth not appear conversing with or questioning Jesus privately, as
Peter often did, and Philip, and Judas, and Thomas, except only when he
desired to show kindness and compliance to his fellow Apostle; for when
the chief  <span id="fr_879"></span>[880](#fn_879.md) of the Apostles by
beckoning constrained him, then he asked. For these two had great love
each for the other. Thus, for instance, they are seen going up together
into the Temple and speaking in common to the people. Yet Peter in many
places  <span id="fr_880"></span>[881](#fn_880.md) is moved, and speaks
more warmly than John.  And at the end he hears Christ say, “Peter,
 <span id="fr_881"></span>[882](#fn_881.md) lovest thou Me more than
these?” ( [John 21.15](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#015.md)<span
id="iv.xxxv-p43.3"></span> .) Now it is clear that he who loved “more
than these” was also beloved. But this in his case was shown by loving
Jesus, in the case of the other by being beloved by Jesus.  <span
id="fr_882"></span>[883](#fn_882.md)

<span id="iv.xxxv-p45"></span> What then was it which caused this
especial love? To my thinking, it was that the man displayed great
gentleness and meekness, for which reason he doth not appear in many
places speaking openly. And how great a thing this is, is plain also
from the case of Moses. It was this which made him such and so great as
he was. There is nothing equal to lowliness of mind. For which cause
Jesus with this began the Beatitudes, and when about to lay as it were
the foundation and base of a mighty building, He placed first lowliness
of mind. Without this a man cannot possibly be saved; though he fast,
though he pray, though he give alms, if it be with a proud spirit, these
 <span id="fr_883"></span>[884](#fn_883.md) things are abominable, if
humility be not there; while if it be, all these things are amiable and
lovely, and are <span id="page_117">p. 117</span> <span
id="iv.xxxv-Page_117"></span> done with safety. Let us then be modest,
 <span id="fr_884"></span>[885](#fn_884.md) beloved, let us be modest;
success is easy, if we be sober-minded. For after all what is it, O man,
that exciteth thee to pride? Seest thou not the poverty of thy nature?
the unsteadiness  <span id="fr_885"></span>[886](#fn_885.md) of thy will?
Consider thine end, consider the multitude of thy sins. But perhaps
because thou doest many righteous deeds thou art proud. By that very
pride thou shalt undo them all. Wherefore it behoveth not so much him
that has sinned  <span id="fr_886"></span>[887](#fn_886.md) as him that
doeth righteousness to take pains to be humble. Why so? Because the
sinner is constrained by conscience, while the other, except he be very
sober, soon caught up as by a blast of wind is lifted on high, and made
to vanish like the Pharisee. Dost thou give to the poor? What thou
givest is not thine, but thy Master’s, common to thee and thy
fellow-servants. For which cause thou oughtest especially to be humbled,
in the calamities of those who are thy kindred foreseeing thine own, and
taking knowledge of thine own nature in their cases. We ourselves
perhaps are sprung from such ancestors; and if wealth has shifted to
you, it is probable that it will leave you again. And after all, what is
wealth? A vain  <span id="fr_887"></span>[888](#fn_887.md) shadow,
dissolving smoke, a flower of the grass, or rather something meaner than
a flower. Why then art thou high-minded over grass? Doth not wealth fall
to thieves, and effeminates, and harlots, and tomb-breakers? Doth this
puff thee up, that thou hast such as these to share in thy possession?
or dost thou desire honor? Towards gaining honor nothing is more
serviceable than almsgiving. For the honors arising from wealth and
power are compulsory, and attended with hatred, but these others are
from the free will and real feeling of the honorers; and therefore those
who pay them can never give them. Now if men show such reverence for the
merciful, and invoke all blessings upon them, consider what return, what
recompense they shall receive from the merciful God. Let us then seek
this wealth which endureth forever, and never deserts  <span
id="fr_888"></span>[889](#fn_888.md) us, that, becoming great here and
glorious there, we may obtain everlasting blessings, through the grace
and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, with whom to the Father and
the Holy Spirit be glory, now and ever, and world without end. Amen.
