<span id="iv.lxxxvi-p2"></span> <span id="iv.lxxxvi-p2.1"></span> <span
class="c1"><span id="iv.lxxxvi-p2.2"></span>[John xviii.

<span id="iv.lxxxvi-p3"></span>“To this end was I born, and for this
cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth .
Every one that is of the truth heareth My Voice.”

<span id="iv.lxxxvi-p4"></span> \[1.\] <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.lxxxvi-p4.1"></span>A marvelous</span> thing is longsuffering; it
places the soul as in a quiet harbor, fleeing it from tossings  <span
id="fr_2437"></span>[2438](#fn_2437.md) and evil spirits. And this
everywhere Christ hath taught us, but especially now, when He is judged,
and dragged, and led about. For when He was brought to Annas, He
answered with great gentleness, and, to the servant who smote Him, said
what had power to bring down all his insolence; thence having gone to
Caiaphas, then to Pilate, and having spent the whole night in these
scenes, He all through exhibiteth His own mildness; and when they said
that He was a malefactor, and were not able to prove it, He stood
silent; but when He was questioned concerning the Kingdom, then He spake
to Pilate, instructing him, and leading him in to  <span
id="fr_2438"></span>[2439](#fn_2438.md) higher matters. But why was it that
Pilate made the enquiry not in their presence, but apart, having gone
into the judgment hall? He suspected something great respecting Him, and
wished, without being troubled by the Jews, to learn all accurately.
Then when he said, “What hast thou done?” on this point Jesus made no
answer; but concerning that of which Pilate most desired to hear,
namely, His Kingdom, He answered, saying, “My Kingdom is not of this
world.” That is, “I am indeed a King, yet not such an one as thou
suspectest, but far more glorious,” declaring  <span
id="fr_2439"></span>[2440](#fn_2439.md) by these words and those which
follow, that no evil had been done by Him. For one who saith, “To this
end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should
bear witness unto the truth,” showeth, that no evil hath been done by
Him. Then when He saith, “Every one that is of the truth heareth My
voice,” He draweth him on by these means, and persuadeth him to become a
listener to the words. “For if,” saith He, “any one is true, and
desireth these things,  <span id="fr_2440"></span>[2441](#fn_2440.md) he
will certainly hear Me.” And, in fact, He so took him by these short
words, that he said,

<span id="iv.lxxxvi-p9"></span> [John
18.38](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#038.md)<span id="iv.lxxxvi-p9.1"></span>
. “What is truth?”

<span id="iv.lxxxvi-p10"></span>But for the present he applieth himself
to what was pressing, for he knew that this question needed time, and
desired to rescue Him from the violence of the Jews. Wherefore he went
out, and what said he?

<span id="iv.lxxxvi-p11"></span> “I find no fault in him.”  <span
id="fr_2441"></span>[2442](#fn_2441.md)

<span id="iv.lxxxvi-p13"></span> Consider how prudently he acted. He
said not, “Since he hath sinned, and is deserving of death, forgive him
on account of the Feast”;  <span id="fr_2442"></span>[2443](#fn_2442.md)
but having first acquitted Him of all guilt, he asks them over and
above, if they were not minded to dismiss Him as innocent, yet as guilty
to forgive Him on account of the time. Wherefore he added,

<span id="iv.lxxxvi-p15"></span> [John
18:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#039.md),
[40](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#040.md)<span id="iv.lxxxvi-p15.1"></span>
. “Ye have a custom that I should release unto you one at the Passover”;
then in a persuasory way, “Will ye therefore that I release the king of
the Jews? Then cried they all, Not this man, but Barabbas.”  <span
id="fr_2443"></span>[2444](#fn_2443.md)

<span id="iv.lxxxvi-p17"></span> O accursed decision! They demand those
like mannered with themselves, and let the guilty go; but bid him punish
the innocent. For this was their custom from old time. But do thou all
through observe the lovingkindness of the Lord in these circumstances.
Pilate scourged Him  <span id="fr_2444"></span>[2445](#fn_2444.md) perhaps
desiring to exhaust and to soothe the fury of the Jews. For when he had
not been able to deliver Him by his former measures, being anxious to
stay the evil at this point, he scourged Him, and permitted to be done
what was done, the robe and crown to be put on Him, so as to relax their
anger. Wherefore also he led Him forth to them crowned ( [John
19.5](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#005.md)<span id="iv.lxxxvi-p18.5"></span>
), that, seeing the insult which had been done to Him, they might
recover a little from their passion, and vomit their venom. “And how
would the soldiers have done this, had it not been the command of their
ruler?” To gratify the Jews. Since it was not by his command that they
at first went in  <span id="fr_2445"></span>[2446](#fn_2445.md) by night,
but to please the Jews; they dared anything for money. But He, when so
many and such things were done, yet stood silent, as He had done during
the enquiry, and answered nothing. And do thou not merely hear these
things, but keep them continually in thy mind, and when thou beholdest
the King of the world and of all Angels, mocked of the soldiers, by
words and by actions, and bearing all silently, do thou imitate Him by
deeds thyself. For when Pilate had called Him the King of the Jews, and
they now put about Him the ap <span id="page_312">p. 312</span> <span
id="iv.lxxxvi-Page_312"></span> parel of mockery, then Pilate having led
Him out, said,

<span id="iv.lxxxvi-p20"></span> [John
19:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#004.md),
[5](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#005.md)<span id="iv.lxxxvi-p20.1"></span> .
“I find no fault against him. He therefore went forth, wearing the
crown.”  <span id="fr_2446"></span>[2447](#fn_2446.md)

<span id="iv.lxxxvi-p22"></span>But not even so was their rage quenched,
but they cried out,

<span id="iv.lxxxvi-p23"></span> [John
19.6](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#006.md)<span id="iv.lxxxvi-p23.1"></span>
. “Crucify him, crucify him.”  <span
id="fr_2447"></span>[2448](#fn_2447.md)

<span id="iv.lxxxvi-p25"></span>Then Pilate, seeing that all was done in
vain, said,

<span id="iv.lxxxvi-p26"></span>“Take ye him, and crucify him.”

<span id="iv.lxxxvi-p27"></span>Whence it is clear that he had permitted
what had been done before, because of their madness.

<span id="iv.lxxxvi-p28"></span>“For I,” he saith, “find no fault in
him.”

<span id="iv.lxxxvi-p29"></span>\[2.\] See in how many ways the judge
makes His defense, continually acquitting Him of the charges; but none
of these things shamed the dogs from their purpose. For the, “Take ye
him and crucify him,” is the expression of one clearing himself of the
guilt, and thrusting them forward to an action not permitted to them.
They therefore had brought Him, in order that the thing might be done by
the decision of the governor; but the contrary fell out, that He was
rather acquitted than condemned by the governor’s decision. Then,
because they were ashamed,

<span id="iv.lxxxvi-p30"></span> [John
19.7](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#007.md)<span id="iv.lxxxvi-p30.1"></span>
. “We have,” they said, “a law, and by our law he ought to die, because
he made himself the Son of God.”

<span id="iv.lxxxvi-p31"></span>“How then when the judge said, ‘Take ye
him, and judge him according to your law,’ did ye reply, ‘It is not
lawful for us to put any man to death,’ while here ye fly to the law?
And consider the charge, ‘He made himself the Son of God.’ Tell me, is
this a ground of accusation, that He who performed the deeds of the Son
of God should call Himself the Son of God?” What then doth Christ? While
they held this dialogue one with the other, He held His peace,
fulfilling that saying of the Prophet, that “He openeth not his mouth:
in His humiliation His judgment was taken away.” ( [Isa.
53:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#007.md),
[8](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#008.md)<span id="iv.lxxxvi-p31.1"></span> ,
LXX.)

<span id="iv.lxxxvi-p32"></span> Then Pilate is alarmed  <span
id="fr_2448"></span>[2449](#fn_2448.md) when he hears from them, that He
made Himself the Son of God, and dreads lest the assertion may possibly
be true, and he should seem to transgress; but these men who had learnt
this, both by His deeds and words, did not shudder, but are putting Him
to death for the very reasons for which they ought to have worshiped
Him. On this account he no more asks Him, “What hast thou done?” but,
shaken by fear, he begins the enquiry again, saying, “Art thou the
Christ?” But He answered not. For he who had heard, “To this end was I
born, and for this came I,” and, “My Kingdom is not of this world,” he,
when he ought to have opposed His enemies and delivered Him, did not so,
but seconded the fury of the Jews. Then they being in every way
silenced, make their cry issue in a political charge, saying, “He that
maketh himself a king, speaketh against Cæsar.” ( [John
19.12](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#012.md)<span
id="iv.lxxxvi-p33.6"></span> .) Pilate ought therefore to have
accurately enquired, whether He had aimed at sovereignty, and set His
hand to expel Cæsar from the kingdom. But he makes not an exact enquiry,
and therefore Christ answered him nothing, because He knew that he asked
all the questions idly.  <span id="fr_2449"></span>[2450](#fn_2449.md)
Besides, since His works bare witness to Him, He would not prevail by
word, nor compose any defense, showing that He came voluntarily to this
condition. When He was silent, Pilate saith,

<span id="iv.lxxxvi-p35"></span> [John
19.10](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#010.md)<span
id="iv.lxxxvi-p35.1"></span> . “Knowest thou not that I have power to
crucify thee?”  <span id="fr_2450"></span>[2451](#fn_2450.md)

<span id="iv.lxxxvi-p37"></span>Seest thou how he condemned himself
beforehand; for, “if the whole rests with thee, why dost not thou let
Him go, when thou hast found no fault in Him?” When then Pilate had
uttered the sentence against himself, then He saith,

<span id="iv.lxxxvi-p38"></span> [John
19.11](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#011.md)<span
id="iv.lxxxvi-p38.1"></span> . “He that delivered Me unto thee hath the
greater sin.”

<span id="iv.lxxxvi-p39"></span>Showing that he also was guilty of sin.
Then, to pull down his pride and arrogance, He saith,

<span id="iv.lxxxvi-p40"></span> “Thou wouldst have no power except it
were given thee.”  <span id="fr_2451"></span>[2452](#fn_2451.md)

<span id="iv.lxxxvi-p42"></span> Showing that this did not come to pass
merely in the common order of events,  <span
id="fr_2452"></span>[2453](#fn_2452.md) but that it was accomplished
mystically. Then lest, when thou hearest, “Except it were given thee,”
thou shouldest deem that Pilate was exempt from all blame, on this
account therefore He said, “Therefore he that delivered Me unto thee
hath the greater sin.” “And yet if it was given, neither he nor they
were liable to any charge.” “Thou objectest idly; for the ‘given’ in
this place means what is ‘allowed’; as though He had said, ‘He hath
permitted these things to be, yet not for that are ye clear of the
wickedness.’” He awed Pilate by the words, and proffered a clear
defense. On which account that person sought to release Him; but they
again cried out, saying,  <span id="fr_2453"></span>[2454](#fn_2453.md)

<span id="iv.lxxxvi-p45"></span> <span id="page_313">p. 313</span> <span
id="iv.lxxxvi-Page_313"></span>[John
19.12](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#012.md)<span
id="iv.lxxxvi-p45.1"></span> . “If thou let this man go, thou art not
Cæsar’s friend.”

<span id="iv.lxxxvi-p46"></span>For when they profited nothing by
bringing charges drawn from their own law, they wickedly betook
themselves to external laws, saying,

<span id="iv.lxxxvi-p47"></span>“Every one that maketh himself a king
speaketh against Cæsar.”

<span id="iv.lxxxvi-p48"></span> And where hath this Man appeared as a
tyrant? Whence can ye prove it? By the purple robe? By the diadem? By
the dress?  <span id="fr_2454"></span>[2455](#fn_2454.md) By the soldiers?
Did not He ever walk unattended, save by His twelve disciples, following
in every point a humble mode of living, both as to food, and clothing,
and habitation? But O what shamelessness and ill-time cowardice! For
Pilate, deeming that he should now incur some danger were he to overlook
these words, comes forth as though to enquire into the matter,  <span
id="fr_2455"></span>[2456](#fn_2455.md) (for the “sitting down” showed
this,) but without making  <span id="fr_2456"></span>[2457](#fn_2456.md)
any enquiry, he gave Him up to them, thinking to shame them. For to
prove that he did it for this purpose, hear what he saith.

<span id="iv.lxxxvi-p52"></span> [John
19:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#014.md),
[15](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#015.md)<span id="iv.lxxxvi-p52.1"></span>
. “Behold your king!” But when they said, “Crucify him,” he added again,
“Shall I crucify your king?” But they cried out, “We have no king but
Cæsar.”  <span id="fr_2457"></span>[2458](#fn_2457.md)

<span id="iv.lxxxvi-p54"></span> Of their own will they subjected
themselves to punishment; therefore also God gave them up, because they
were the first to cast themselves out from His providence and
superintendence; and since with one voice they rejected His sovereignty,
He allowed them to fall by their own suffrages. Still what had been said
should have been sufficient to calm their passion, but they feared,
lest, being let go, He should again draw the multitudes, and they did
all they could to prevent this. For a dreadful thing is love of rule,
dreadful and able to destroy the soul; it was on account of this that
they had never heard Him. And yet Pilate, in consequence of a few words,
desired to let Him go, but they pressed on, saying, “Crucify him.” And
why did they strive to kill Him in this manner? It was a shameful death.
Fearing therefore lest there should afterwards be any remembrance of
Him, they desired to bring Him to the accursed punishment, not knowing
that truth is exalted by hindrances. To prove that they had this
suspicion, listen to what they say;  <span
id="fr_2458"></span>[2459](#fn_2458.md) “We have heard that that deceiver
said, After three days I will rise again” ( [Matt. xxvii.
63](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#063.md) <span id="iv.lxxxvi-p55.3"></span>
); on this account they made all this stir, turning things upside down,
 <span id="fr_2459"></span>[2460](#fn_2459.md) that they might ruin matters
in after time.  <span id="fr_2460"></span>[2461](#fn_2460.md) And the
ill-ordered people, corrupted by their rulers, cried out continually,
“Crucify him!”

<span id="iv.lxxxvi-p58"></span>\[3.\] But let us not merely read of
these things, but bear them in our mind; the crown of thorns, the robe,
the reed, the blows, the smiting on the cheek, the spittings, the irony.
These things, if continually meditated on, are sufficient to take down
all anger; and if we be mocked at, if we suffer injustice, let us still
say, “The servant is not greater than his Lord” ( [John
13.16](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#016.md)<span
id="iv.lxxxvi-p58.1"></span> ); and let us bring forward the words of
the Jews, which they uttered in their madness, saying, “Thou art a
Samaritan, and hast a devil” ( [John
8.48](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#048.md)<span id="iv.lxxxvi-p58.2"></span>
); and, “He casteth out devils by Beelzebub.” ( [Luke xi.
15](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#015.md) <span id="iv.lxxxvi-p58.3"></span>
.) For on this account He bare all these things, in order that we might
walk in His footsteps, and endure those mockings which disturb more than
any other kind of reproach. Yet nevertheless He not only bare these
things, but even used every means to save and deliver from the appointed
punishment those who did them. For He sent the Apostles also for their
salvation, at least thou hearest them saying, that, “We  <span
id="fr_2461"></span>[2462](#fn_2461.md) know that through ignorance ye did
it” ( [Acts iii. 17](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#017.md) <span
id="iv.lxxxvi-p59.3"></span> ); and by these means drawing them to
repentance. This let us also imitate; for nothing so much maketh God
propitious as the loving enemies, and doing good to those who
despitefully use us. When a man insults thee, look not to him, but to
the devil who moves him, and against him empty all thy wrath, but pity
the man who is moved by him. For if lying is from the devil, to be angry
without a cause is much more so. When thou seest one turning another
into ridicule, consider that it is the devil who moves him, for mockings
belong not to Christians. For he who hath been bidden to mourn, and hath
heard, “Woe, ye that laugh” ( [Luke vi.
25](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#025.md) <span id="iv.lxxxvi-p59.4"></span>
), and who after this insults, and jests, and is excited, demands not
reproach from us, but sorrow, since Christ also was troubled when He
thought on Judas. All these things therefore let us practice in our
actions, for if we act not rightly in these, we have come to no purpose
and in vain into the world. Or rather we have come to our harm, for
faith is not sufficient to bring men to the Kingdom, nay, it even hath
power  <span id="fr_2462"></span>[2463](#fn_2462.md) in this way most to
condemn those who exhibit an ill life; for He “which knew his Lord’s
will, and did it not, shall be beaten with many stripes” ( [Luke xii.
47](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#047.md) <span id="iv.lxxxvi-p60.5"></span>
); and again, “If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had
sin.” ( [John 15.22](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#022.md)<span
id="iv.lxxxvi-p60.6"></span> .) What excuse then shall we have, who have
been set within <span id="page_314">p. 314</span> <span
id="iv.lxxxvi-Page_314"></span> the palace, and deemed worthy to stoop
 <span id="fr_2463"></span>[2464](#fn_2463.md) down and enter into the
sanctuary, and have been made partakers of the releasing Mysteries,
 <span id="fr_2464"></span>[2465](#fn_2464.md) and who yet are worse than
the Greeks, who have shared in none of these things? For if they for the
sake of vainglory have shown so much true wisdom, much more ought we to
go after all virtue, because it is pleasing to God. But at present we do
not even despise wealth; while they have often been careless of their
life, and in wars have given up their children to their madness about
devils,  <span id="fr_2465"></span>[2466](#fn_2465.md) and have despised
nature for the sake of their devils, but we do not even despise money
for the sake of Christ, nor anger on account of God’s will, but are
inflamed, and in no better state than the fevered. And just as they,
when possessed by their malady, are all burning, so we, suffocated as by
some fire, can stop at no point of desire, increasing both anger and
avarice. On this account I am ashamed and astonished, when I behold
among the Greeks men despising riches, but all mad among ourselves. For
even if we could find some despising riches, we should find that they
have been made  <span id="fr_2466"></span>[2467](#fn_2466.md) captive by
other vices, by passion or envy; and a hard thing it is to discover true
wisdom without a blemish.  <span id="fr_2467"></span>[2468](#fn_2467.md)
But the reason is, that we are not earnest to get our remedies from the
Scriptures, nor do we apply ourselves to those Scriptures with
compunction, and sorrow, and groaning, but carelessly, if at any time we
chance to be at leisure. Therefore when a great rush of worldly matters
comes, it overwhelms all; and if there hath been any profit, destroys
it. For if a man have a wound, and after putting on a plaster, do not
tie it tight, but allow it to fall off, and expose his sore to wet, and
dust, and heat, and ten thousand other things able to irritate it, he
will get no good; yet not by reason of the inefficacy of the remedies,
but by reason of his own carelessness. And this also is wont to happen
to us, when we attend but little to the divine oracles, but give
ourselves up wholly and incessantly to things of this life; for thus all
the seed is choked, and all is made unfruitful. That this may not be the
case, let us look carefully a little, let us look up to heaven, let us
bend down to the tombs and coffins of the departed. For the same end
awaiteth us, and the same necessity of departure will often come upon us
before the evening. Prepare we then for this expedition;  <span
id="fr_2468"></span>[2469](#fn_2468.md) there is need of many supplies for
the journey,  <span id="fr_2469"></span>[2470](#fn_2469.md) for great is
the heat there, and great the drought, and great the solitude.
Henceforth there is no reposing at an inn, there is no buying anything,
when one hath not taken all from hence. Hear at least what the virgins
say, “Go ye to them that sell” ( [Matt. xxv.
9](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#009.md) <span id="iv.lxxxvi-p67.3"></span>
); but they who went found not. Hear what Abraham saith, “A gulf between
us and you.” ( [Luke xvi. 26](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#026.md) <span
id="iv.lxxxvi-p67.4"></span> .) Hear what Ezekiel saith concerning that
day, that Noah, and Job, and Daniel shall in nowise deliver their sons.
( [Ezek. xiv. 14](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#014.md) <span
id="iv.lxxxvi-p67.5"></span> .) But may it never come to pass that we
hear these words, but that having taken hence sufficient provision for
our way to eternal life, we may behold with boldness our Lord Jesus
Christ, with whom to the Father and the Holy Ghost be glory, dominion,
honor, now and ever, and world without end. Amen.
