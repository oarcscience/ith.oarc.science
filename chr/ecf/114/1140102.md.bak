<span id="v.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c15"><span

<span id="v.viii-p2"></span> <span id="v.viii-p2.1"></span> <span
class="c1"><span id="v.viii-p2.2"></span>[Hebrews ii.
5-7](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#005.md)<span
id="v.viii-p2.3"></span></span>

<span id="v.viii-p3"></span>“For unto Angels He hath not put in
subjection the world to come, whereof we speak. But one in a certain
place testified, saying, What is man that Thou art mindful of him, or
the son of man that Thou visitest him? Thou madest him a little lower
than the Angels.”

<span id="v.viii-p4"></span> \[1.\] <span class="c11"><span
id="v.viii-p4.1"></span>I could</span> have wished to know for certain
whether any hear with fitting earnestness the things that are said,
whether we are not casting the seeds by the wayside: for in that case I
should have made my instructions with more cheerfulness. For we shall
speak, though no one hear, for the fear which is laid on us by our
Saviour. For, saith He, testify to this people; even if they hear not,
thou shalt thyself be guiltless.  (See [Ezek. iii.
19](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#019) <span id="v.viii-p4.2"></span> ..md)
If however I had been persuaded of your earnestness, I should have
spoken not for fear only, but should have done it with pleasure also.
For now indeed, even if no man hear, even if my work, so long as I
fulfill my own part, brings no danger, still the labor is not altogether
pleasant. For what profit is it, when though I be not blamed, yet no one
is benefited? But if any would give heed we shall receive advantage not
so much from avoiding punishment ourselves as from your progress.

<span id="v.viii-p5"></span> How then shall I know this? Having taken
notice of some of you, who are not very attentive, I shall question them
privately, when I meet them. And if I find that they retain any of the
things that have been spoken (I say not all, for this would not be very
easy for you), but even if \[they retain\] a few things out of many, it
is plain I should have no further doubts about the rest. And indeed we
ought, without giving notice beforehand, to have attacked you when off
your guard. However it will suffice, if even in this way I should be
able to attain my purpose. Nay rather, even as it is, I can attack you
when you are off your guard. For that I *shall* question you, I have
forewarned you; but *when* I shall question you I do not as yet make
evident. For perhaps it may be to-day; perhaps to-morrow, perhaps after
twenty or thirty days, perhaps after fewer, perhaps after more. Thus has
God also made uncertain the day of our death. Nor hath He allowed it be
clear to us, whether it shall befall us to-day, or to-morrow, or after a
whole year, or after many years; that through the uncertainty of the
expectation we may through all time keep ourselves firm in virtue. And
that we shall indeed depart, He hath said,—but when, He hath not yet
said. Thus too I have said that I shall question you, but I have not
added when, wishing you always to be thoughtful.

<span id="v.viii-p6"></span>And let no man say, I heard these things
four or five weeks ago, or more, and I cannot retain them. For I wish
the hearer so to retain them as to have his recollection perpetual and
not apt to fade, nor yet that he should disown what is spoken. For I
wish you to retain them, not, in order to tell them to me, but that ye
may have profit; and this is of most serious interest to me. Let no one
then say this.

<span id="v.viii-p7"></span>\[2.\] However, I must now begin with what
follows in the epistle. What then is set before us to speak on to-day?

<span id="v.viii-p8"></span> “For not to angels,” he says, “did He put
in subjection the world to come,  <span
id="fr_2780"></span>[2781](#fn_2780.md) whereof we speak.” Is he then
discoursing concerning some other world? No, but concerning this.
Therefore he added “whereof we speak,” that he might not allow the mind
to wander away in search of some other. How then does he call it “the
world to come”? Exactly as he also says in another place, “Who is the
figure of him that was to come,”  <span
id="fr_2781"></span>[2782](#fn_2781.md) ( [Rom. v.
14](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#014) <span id="v.viii-p10.2"></span> ,.md)
when he is speaking about Adam and Christ in the Epistle to the Romans;
calling Christ according to the flesh “Him that was to come” in respect
of the times of Adam, (for \[then\] He was to come). So now also, since
he had said, “but when he bringeth in the First-Begotten into the
world”: that thou mightest not suppose that he is speaking of another
world, it is made certain from many considerations and from his saying
“to come.” For the world was to come, but the Son of God always was.
This world then which was about to come, He put in subjection not to
Angels but to Christ. For that this is spoken with reference to the Son
(he says) is evident: for surely no one would assert the other
alternative, that it had reference to Angels.

<span id="v.viii-p11"></span>Then he brings forward another testimony
also and says, “but one in a certain place testified, saying.” Wherefore
did he not mention the name of the prophet, but hid it? Yea, and in
other testimonies also he doth this: as when he saith, “but when He
bringeth in again the First-Begotten into the world, He saith, And let
all the Angels of God worship Him. And again, I will be to Him a Father.
And of the Angels <span id="page_383">p. 383</span> <span
id="v.viii-Page_383"></span> He saith, Who maketh His angels spirits.
And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundations of the
earth” ( [Heb. 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#006.md),
[5](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#005.md),
[7](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#007.md),
[10](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#010.md)<span id="v.viii-p11.1"></span>
):—so also here he saith, “but one in a certain place testified,
saying.” And this very thing (I conceive) is the act of one that
conceals himself, and shows that they were well skilled in the
Scriptures; his not setting down him who uttered the testimony, but
introducing it as familiar and obvious.

<span id="v.viii-p12"></span> “What is man that Thou art mindful of him,
or the son of man that Thou visitest him? Thou madest him a little lower
than the angels: Thou crownedst him with glory and honor.”  <span
id="fr_2782"></span>[2783](#fn_2782.md) ( [Heb.
2.8](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#008)<span id="v.viii-p13.4"></span> ..md)
“Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet.”

<span id="v.viii-p14"></span> Now although these things were spoken of
human nature generally, they would nevertheless apply more properly to
Christ according to the flesh. For this, “Thou hast put all things in
subjection under his feet,” belongs to Him rather than to us.  For the
Son of God visited us when we were nothing: and after having assumed our
\[nature\],  <span id="fr_2783"></span>[2784](#fn_2783.md) and united it to
Himself, He became higher than all.

<span id="v.viii-p16"></span>“For,” he says, “in that He hath put all
things in subjection under Him, He left nothing not put under Him: but
now we see not yet all things put under Him.” What he means is
this:—since he had said, “Until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool” (
[Heb. 1.13](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#013.md)<span
id="v.viii-p16.1"></span> ),—and it was likely that they would still be
grieved,—then having inserted a few things after this parenthetically,
he added this testimony in confirmation of the former. For that they
might not say, How is it that He hath put His enemies under His feet,
when we have suffered so much? he sufficiently hinted at it in the
former place indeed (for the word “until” showed, not what should take
place immediately, but in course of time) but here he followeth it up.
For do not suppose (he says) that because they have not yet been made
subject, they are not to be made subject: for that they must be made
subject, is evident; for, on this account was the prophecy spoken.
“For,” he says, “in that He hath put all things under Him, He left
nothing not put under Him.” How then is it that all things have not been
put under Him? Because they are hereafter to be put under Him.

<span id="v.viii-p17"></span>If then all things must be made subject to
Him, but have not yet been made subject, do not grieve, nor trouble
thyself. If indeed when the end were come, and all things were made
subject, thou wert still suffering these things, with reason wouldst
thou repine: “But now we see not yet all things put under Him.” The King
has not yet clearly conquered. Why then art thou troubled when suffering
affliction? the preaching \[of the Gospel\] hath not yet prevailed over
all; it is not yet time that they should be altogether made subject.

<span id="v.viii-p18"></span>\[3.\] Then again there is another
consolation if indeed He who is hereafter to have all put in subjection
under Him, hath Himself also died and submitted to sufferings
innumerable. ( [Heb. 2.9](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#009.md)<span
id="v.viii-p18.1"></span> .) “But,” he says, “we see Him who was made a
little  <span id="fr_2784"></span>[2785](#fn_2784.md) lower than the
angels, even Jesus, for the suffering of death”—then the good things
again,—“crowned with glory and honor.” Seest thou, how all things apply
to Him? For the \[expression\], “a little,” would rather suit Him, who
was only three days in Hades, but not ourselves who are for a long time
in corruption. Likewise also the \[expression\] “with glory and honor”
will suit Him much more than us.

<span id="v.viii-p20"></span>Again, he reminds them of the Cross,
thereby effecting two things; both showing His care \[for them\] and
persuading them to bear all things nobly, looking to the Master. For (he
would say) if He who is worshiped of Angels, for thy sake endured to
have a little less than the Angels, much more oughtest thou who art
inferior to the Angels, to bear all things for His sake. Then he shows
that the Cross is “glory and honor,” as He Himself also always calls it,
saying, “That the Son of Man might be glorified” ( [John xi.
5](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#005) <span id="v.viii-p20.1"></span> .md);
and, “the Son of Man is glorified.” ( [John xii.
23](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#023) <span id="v.viii-p20.2"></span> ..md)
If then He calls the \[sufferings\] for His servants’ sake “glory,” much
more shouldest thou the \[sufferings\] for the Lord.

<span id="v.viii-p21"></span>Seest thou the fruit of the Cross, how
great it is? fear not the matter: for it seemeth to thee indeed to be
dismal, but it brings forth good things innumerable. From these
considerations he shows the benefit of trial. Then he says, “That He by
the grace of God should taste death for every man.”

<span id="v.viii-p22"></span>“That by the grace of God,” he says. And He
indeed because of the grace of God towards us suffered these things. “He
who spared not His Own Son,” he says, “but delivered Him up for us all.”
( [Rom. viii. 32](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#032.md) <span
id="v.viii-p22.1"></span> .) Why? He did not owe us this, but has done
it of grace. And again in the Epistle to the Romans he says, “Much more
the grace of God, and the gift by grace which is by one man Jesus
Christ, hath abounded unto many.” ( [Rom. v.
15](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#015) <span id="v.viii-p22.2"></span> ..md)

<span id="v.viii-p23"></span>“That by the grace of God He should taste
death for every man,” not for the faithful only, but even for the whole
world: for He indeed died for all; But what if all have not believed? He
hath fulfilled His own \[part\].

<span id="v.viii-p24"></span>Moreover he said rightly “taste death for
<span id="page_384">p. 384</span> <span id="v.viii-Page_384"></span>
every man,” he did not say “die.” For as if He really was tasting it,
when He had spent a little time therein, He immediately arose.

<span id="v.viii-p25"></span>By saying then “for the suffering of
death,” he signified real death, and by saying “superior to angels,” he
declared the resurrection. For as a physician though not needing to
taste the food prepared for the sick man, yet in his care for him tastes
first himself, that he may persuade the sick man with confidence to
venture on the food, so since all men were afraid of death, in
persuading them to take courage against death, He tasted it also Himself
though He needed not. “For,” He says, “the prince of this world cometh
and findeth nothing in Me.” ( [John xiv.
30](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#030) <span id="v.viii-p25.1"></span> ..md)
So both the words “by grace” and “should taste death for every man,”
establish this.

<span id="v.viii-p26"></span>\[4.\] [Heb.
2.10](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#010.md)<span id="v.viii-p26.1"></span> .
“For it became Him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things,
in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the Captain of their salvation
perfect through sufferings.” He speaks here of the Father. Seest thou
how again he applies the \[expression\] “by whom”  <span
id="fr_2785"></span>[2786](#fn_2785.md) to Him? Which he would not have
done, had it been \[an expression\] of inferiority, and only applicable
to the Son. And what he says is this:—He has done what is worthy of His
love towards mankind, in showing His First-born to be more glorious than
all, and in setting Him forth as an example to the others, like some
noble wrestler that surpasses the rest.

<span id="v.viii-p28"></span>“The Captain of their salvation,” that is,
the Cause of their salvation. Seest thou how great is the space between?
Both He is a Son, and we are sons; but He saves, we are saved. Seest
thou how He both brings us together and then separates us; “bringing,”
he says, “many sons unto glory”: here he brings us together,—“the
Captain of their salvation,” again he separates.

<span id="v.viii-p29"></span> “To make perfect through sufferings.”
 <span id="fr_2786"></span>[2787](#fn_2786.md) Then sufferings are a
perfecting, and a cause of salvation. Seest thou that to suffer
affliction is not the portion of those who are utterly forsaken; if
indeed it was by this that God first honored His Son, by leading Him
through sufferings? And truly His taking flesh to suffer what He did
suffer, is a far greater thing than making the world, and bringing it
out of things that are not. This indeed also is \[a token\] of His
loving-kindness, but the other far more.  And \[the Apostle\] himself
also pointing out this very thing, says, “That in the ages to come He
might show forth the exceeding riches of His goodness, He both raised us
up together, and made us sit together in the heavenly places in Christ
Jesus.” ( [Eph. 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#007.md),
[6](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#006)<span id="v.viii-p30.2"></span> ..md)

<span id="v.viii-p31"></span>“For it became Him for whom are all things
and by whom are all things in bringing many sons to glory, to make the
Captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.” For (he means)
it became Him who taketh tender care, and brought all things into being,
to give up the Son for the salvation of the rest, the One for the many.
However he did not express himself thus, but, “to make perfect through
sufferings,” showing the suffering for any one, not merely profits
“him,” but he himself also becomes more glorious and more perfect. And
this too he says in reference to the faithful, comforting them by the
way: for Christ was glorified then when He suffered. But when I say, He
was glorified, do not suppose that there was an accession of glory to
Him: for that which is of nature He always had, and received nothing in
addition.

<span id="v.viii-p32"></span> \[5.\] “For,” he says, “both He that
sanctifieth, and they who are sanctified, are all of one, for which
cause He is not ashamed to call them brethren.” Behold again how he
brings \[them\] together, honoring and comforting them, and making them
brethren of Christ, in this respect that they are “of one.”  <span
id="fr_2787"></span>[2788](#fn_2787.md) Then again guarding himself and
showing that he is speaking of that which is according to the flesh, he
introduces, “For He who sanctifieth,” \[i.e.\] Christ, “and they who are
sanctified,” ourselves. Dost thou see how great is the difference?
 <span id="fr_2788"></span>[2789](#fn_2788.md) He sanctifies, we are
sanctified. And above he said, “the Captain of their salvation. For
there is one God, of whom are all things.”  <span
id="fr_2789"></span>[2790](#fn_2789.md) ( [1 Cor. viii.
6](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#006) <span id="v.viii-p35.6"></span> ..md)

<span id="v.viii-p36"></span> “For which cause He is not ashamed to call
them brethren.” Seest thou how again he shows the superiority? For by
saying, “He is not ashamed,” he shows that the whole comes not of the
nature of the thing, but of the loving affection of Him who was “not
ashamed” of anything, \[yea\] of His great humility. For though we be
“of one,” yet He sanctifieth and we are sanctified: and great is the
difference.  <span id="fr_2790"></span>[2791](#fn_2790.md) Moreover “He” is
of the Father, as a true Son, that is, of His substance; “we,” as
created, that is, brought out of things that are not, so that the
difference is great. Wherefore he says, “He is not ashamed to call them
brethren” ( [Heb. 2.12](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#012.md)<span
id="v.viii-p37.2"></span> ), “saying, I will declare Thy name unto My
brethren.” ( [Ps. xxii. 22](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#022.md) <span
id="v.viii-p37.3"></span> .) For when He clothed Himself with flesh, He
clothed Himself also with the brotherhood, and at the same time came in
the brotherhood.

<span id="v.viii-p38"></span>This indeed he brings forward naturally.
But this ( [Heb. 2.13](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#013.md)<span
id="v.viii-p38.1"></span> ) “I will put my trust in Him” ( [2 Sam. xxii.
3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#003) <span id="v.viii-p38.2"></span> .md),
what does it mean? For what follows this is also \[introduced\]
naturally. “Behold, I and the children which God hath given Me.” ( [Isa.
8.18](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#018.md)<span
id="v.viii-p38.3"></span><span id="page_385">p. 385</span> <span
id="v.viii-Page_385"></span> .) For as here He shows Himself a Father,
so before, a Brother. “I will declare Thy name unto My brethren,” He
saith.

<span id="v.viii-p39"></span>And again he indicates the superiority and
the great interval \[between us\], by what follows ( [Heb.
2.14](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#014)<span id="v.viii-p39.1"></span> .md):
“Since then the children,” he saith, “are partakers of flesh and blood”
(thou seest where he saith the likeness is? in reference to the flesh),
“in like manner He also Himself took part of the same.” Let all the
Heretics be ashamed, let those hide their faces who say that He came in
appearance and not in reality.  <span
id="fr_2791"></span>[2792](#fn_2791.md) For he did not say, “He took part
of these” only, and then say no more; although had he said thus, it
would have been sufficient, but he asserted something more, adding “in
like manner,” not in appearance, he means, or by an image (since in that
case “in like manner” is not preserved) but in reality; showing the
brotherhood.

<span id="v.viii-p41"></span> \[6.\] Next he sets down also the cause of
the economy.  <span id="fr_2792"></span>[2793](#fn_2792.md) “That through
death,” he says, “He might destroy him that had the power of death, that
is, the devil.”

<span id="v.viii-p43"></span>Here he points out the wonder, that by what
the devil prevailed, by that was he overcome, and the very thing which
was his strong weapon against the world, \[namely\], Death, by this
Christ smote him. In this he exhibits the greatness of the conqueror’s
power. Dost thou see how great good death hath wrought?

<span id="v.viii-p44"></span> [Heb.
2.15](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#015.md)<span id="v.viii-p44.1"></span> .
“And should deliver them,” he says, “who through fear of death were all
their lifetime subject to bondage.” Why (he means) do ye shudder? Why do
you fear him that hath been brought to nought? He is no longer terrible,
but has been trodden under foot, hath been utterly despised; he is vile
and of no account. ( [2 Tim. i. 10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#010.md)
<span id="v.viii-p44.2"></span> .)

<span id="v.viii-p45"></span>But what is “through fear of death were all
their life-time subject to bondage”? He either means this, that he who
fears death is a slave, and submits to all things rather than die; or
this, that all men were slaves of death and were held under his power,
because he had not yet been done away; or that men lived in continual
fear, ever expecting that they should die, and being afraid of death,
could have no sense of pleasure, while this fear was present with them. 
For this he hinted at in saying, “All their life-time.” He here shows
that the afflicted, the harassed, the persecuted, those that are
deprived of country and of substance and of all other things, spend
their lives more sweetly and more freely than they of old time who were
in luxury, who suffered no such afflictions, who were in continual
prosperity, if indeed these “all their life-time” were under this fear
and were slaves; while the others have been made free and laugh at that
which they shudder at. For this is now as if, when one was being led
away to a captivity leading to death, and in continual expectation of
it, one should feed him up with abundant dainties (something such as
this was Death of old); but now, as if some one taking away that fear
together with the dainties, were to promise a contest, and propose a
combat that should lead no longer to death, but to a kingdom. Of which
number wouldst thou have wished to be—those who are fed up in the
prison-house, while every day looking for their sentence, or those who
contend much and labor willingly, that they may crown themselves with
the diadem of the kingdom? Seest thou how he has raised up their soul,
and made them elated? He shows too, that not death alone has been put an
end to, but that thereby he also who is ever showing that war without
truce against us, I mean the devil, hath been brought to nought; since
he that fears not death is out of reach of the devil’s tyranny.  For if
“skin for skin, yea all things a man would give for his life” ( [Job ii.
4](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#004.md) <span id="v.viii-p45.1"></span>
)—when any one has determined to disregard even this, of what
henceforward will he be the slave? He fears no one, he is in terror of
no one, he is higher than all, and more free than all. For he that
disregards his own life, much more \[doth he disregard\] all other
things. And when the devil finds a soul such as this, he can accomplish
in it none of his works. For what? tell me, shall he threaten the loss
of property, and degradation, and banishment from one’s country? But
these are small matters to him who “counteth not even his life dear” (
[Acts xx. 24](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#024.md) <span
id="v.viii-p45.2"></span> ) unto him, according to the blessed Paul.
Thou seest that in casting out the tyranny of death, he also overthrew
the strength of the devil. For he who has learnt to study innumerable
\[truths\] concerning the resurrection,  <span
id="fr_2793"></span>[2794](#fn_2793.md) how should he fear death? How
should he shudder any more?

<span id="v.viii-p47"></span>\[7.\] Therefore be ye not grieved, saying,
why do we suffer such and such things? For so the victory becomes more
glorious. And it would not have been glorious, unless by death He had
destroyed death; but the most wonderful thing is that He conquered him
by the very means by which he was strong, showing in every point the
abundance of His means, and the excellence of His contrivances. Let us
not then prove false to the gift bestowed on us. “For we,” he says,
“have received not a spirit of fear, but a spirit of power, and of love,
and of a sound mind.” ( [Rom. 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#015.md), [2
Tim. 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#007.md)<span
id="v.viii-p47.1"></span> .) Let us stand then nobly, laughing death to
scorn.

<span id="v.viii-p48"></span>But \[I pause\] for it comes over me to
groan <span id="page_386">p. 386</span> <span
id="v.viii-Page_386"></span> bitterly \[at the thought of\] whither
Christ hath raised us up, and whither we have brought ourselves down.
For when I see the wailings in the public places, the groanings over
those departing life, the howlings, the other unseemly behavior, believe
me, I am ashamed before those heathen, and Jews, and heretics who see
it, and before all who for this cause openly laugh us to scorn. For
whatever I may afterwards say, I shall talk to no purpose, when
philosophizing concerning the resurrection. Why? Because the heathen do
not attend to what is said by me, but to what is done by you. For they
will say at once, ‘when will any of these \[fellows\] be able to despise
death, when he is not able to see another dead?’

<span id="v.viii-p49"></span>Beautiful things were spoken by Paul,
beautiful and worthy of Heaven, and of the love of God to man. For what
does he say? “And He shall deliver them who through fear of death, were
all their life-time subject to bondage.” But ye do not allow these
things to be believed, fighting against them by your deeds. And yet many
things exist for this very end, God building a stronghold against it,
that He might destroy this same evil custom. For tell me, what mean the
bright torches? Do we not send them before as athletes? And what
\[mean\] the hymns? Do we not glorify God, and give thanks that at last
He has crowned the departed one, that He has freed him from his labors,
that taking away uncertainty, He has him with Himself? Are not the Hymns
for this? Is not Psalmody for this? All these are the acts of those
rejoicing. “For,” it is said, “is any merry? let him sing psalms.” (
[Jas. v. 13](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#013.md) <span
id="v.viii-p49.1"></span> .) But to these things the heathen give no
heed. For (one will say) do not tell me of him who is philosophical
 <span id="fr_2794"></span>[2795](#fn_2794.md) when out of the affliction,
for this is nothing great or surprising;—show me a man who in the very
affliction itself is philosophical, and then I will believe the
resurrection,

<span id="v.viii-p51"></span> And indeed, that women engaged in the
affairs of this life  <span id="fr_2795"></span>[2796](#fn_2795.md) should
act thus is no way surprising. And yet indeed this even is dreadful; for
from them also is the same philosophy required. Wherefore also Paul
says, “But concerning them which are asleep, I would not have you
ignorant, that ye sorrow not even as the rest who have no hope.” ( [1
Thess. iv. 13](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#013.md) <span
id="v.viii-p52.2"></span> .) He wrote not this to solitaries, nor to
perpetual virgins, but to women and men in the world.  <span
id="fr_2796"></span>[2797](#fn_2796.md) But however this is not so
dreadful. But when any man or woman, professing to be crucified to the
world, he tears his hair, and she shrieks violently—what can be more
unseemly than this? Believe me when I say if things were done as they
ought, such persons should be excluded for a long time from the
thresholds of the Church. For those who are indeed worthy of being
grieved for, are these who still fear and shudder at death, who have no
faith in the resurrection.

<span id="v.viii-p54"></span>‘But I do not disbelieve the resurrection’
(one says) ‘but I long after his society.’ Why then, tell me, when he
goes from home, and that for a long absence, dost not thou do the same?
‘Yea, but I do weep then also’ (she says) ‘and mourn as I long after
him.’ But that is the conduct of those that really long after their
associates, this that of her who despairs of his return.

<span id="v.viii-p55"></span>Think, what thou singest on that occasion,
“Return unto thy rest, O my soul, for the Lord hath dealt bountifully
with thee.” ( [Ps. cxvi. 7](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#007.md) <span
id="v.viii-p55.1"></span> .) And again, “I will fear no evil, for Thou
art with me.” ( [Ps. xxiii. 4](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#004.md) <span
id="v.viii-p55.2"></span> .) And again, “Thou art my refuge from the
affliction which encompasseth me.” ( [Ps. xxxii.
7](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#007) <span id="v.viii-p55.3"></span> ..md)
Think what these Psalms mean. But thou dost not give heed, but art drunk
from grief.

<span id="v.viii-p56"></span>Consider carefully the funeral lamentations
of others that thou mayest have a remedy in thine own case. “Return, O
my soul, to thy rest, for the Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee.”
Tell me, sayest thou that the Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee, and
weepest? Is not this mere acting, is it not hypocrisy? For if indeed
thou really believest the things thou sayest, thy sorrow is superfluous:
but if thou art in sport and acting a part, and thinkest these things
fables, why dost thou sing psalms? Why dost thou even endure the
attendants? Why dost thou not drive away the singers? But this would be
the act of madmen. And yet far more the other.

<span id="v.viii-p57"></span>For the present, then, I advise you: but as
time goes on, I shall treat the matter more seriously: for indeed I am
greatly afraid that by this practice some grievous disease may make its
way into the Church. The case of the wailings then we will hereafter
correct. And meanwhile I charge and testify, both to rich and poor, both
to women and men.

<span id="v.viii-p58"></span>May God indeed grant that you all depart
out of life unwailed, and according to the fitting rule fathers now
grown old may be attended to their graves by sons, and mothers by
daughters, and grand-children, and great grand-children, in a green old
age, and that untimely death may in no case occur. May this then be, and
this I pray, and I exhort the prelates and all of you to beseech God for
each other, and to make this prayer in common. But if (which God forbid,
and may it never happen) any bitter death should occur, bitter, I mean,
not in its nature (for henceforth there is no bitter death, for it
differs not at all from sleep), but bitter in regard of your
disposition, if it should happen, and any <span id="page_387">p.
387</span> <span id="v.viii-Page_387"></span> should hire these mourning
women, believe me when I say (I speak not without meaning  <span
id="fr_2797"></span>[2798](#fn_2797.md) but as I have resolved, let him who
will, be angry), that person we will exclude from the Church for a long
time, as we do the idolater. For if Paul calls “the covetous man an
idolater” ( [Eph. v. 5](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#005.md) <span
id="v.viii-p59.3"></span> ), much more him who brings in the practices
of the idolaters over a believer.

<span id="v.viii-p60"></span>For, tell me, for what cause dost thou
invite presbyters, and the singers? Is it not to afford consolation? Is
it not to honor the departed? Why then dost thou insult him? And why
dost thou make him a public show? And why dost thou make game as on a
stage? We come, discoursing of the things concerning the resurrection,
instructing all, even those who have not yet been smitten, by the honor
shown to him, to bear it nobly if any such thing should happen and dost
thou bring those who overthrow our \[teachings\] as much as in them
lieth? What can be worse than this ridicule and mockery? What more
grievous than this inconsistency?

<span id="v.viii-p61"></span>\[8.\] Be ashamed and show reverence: but
if ye will not, we cannot endure the bringing in upon the Church of
practices so destructive. For, it is said, “them that sin rebuke before
all.” ( [1 Tim. v. 20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#020.md) <span
id="v.viii-p61.1"></span> .) And as to those miserable and wretched
women, we through you forbid them  <span
id="fr_2798"></span>[2799](#fn_2798.md) ever to introduce themselves into
the funerals of the faithful, lest we should oblige them in good earnest
to wail over their own evils, and teach them not to do these things in
the ills of others, but rather to weep for their own misfortunes. For an
affectionate father too, when he has a disorderly son, not only advises
him not to draw near to the wicked, but puts them in fear also. Behold
then, I advise you, and those women through you, that you do not invite
such persons, and that they do not attend. And may God grant that my
words may produce some effect, and that my threat may avail. But if
(which God forbid) we should be disregarded, we have no choice
henceforward but to put our threat into execution, chastising you by the
laws of the Church, and those women as befits them.

<span id="v.viii-p63"></span>Now if any man is obstinate and
contemptuous, let him hear Christ saying even now, “If any one trespass
against thee, go, tell him his fault between thee and him alone”; but if
he will not be persuaded, “take with thee one or two.” But if even so he
contradict, “tell it to the Church, but if he shall also refuse to hear
the Church, let him be unto thee as a heathen man and a publican.” (
[Matt. 18:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#015.md),
[16](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#016.md),
[17](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#017)<span id="v.viii-p63.1"></span> ..md)
Now if when a man trespasses against me, and will not be persuaded,
\[the Lord\] commands me thus to turn away from him, judge ye in what
light I ought to hold him who trespasses against himself, and against
God. For do not you yourselves condemn us when we come down so gently
upon you?

<span id="v.viii-p64"></span>If however any man disregard the bonds
which we inflict, again let Christ instruct him, saying, “Whatsoever ye
shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever ye shall
loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.” ( [Matt. xviii.
18](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#018) <span id="v.viii-p64.1"></span> ..md)
For though we ourselves be miserable and good for nothing and worthy to
be despised, as indeed we are; yet are we not avenging ourselves nor
warding off anger, but are caring for your salvation.

<span id="v.viii-p65"></span>Be influenced by reverence, I beseech you,
and respect. For if a man bear with a friend when he attacks him more
vehemently than he ought, ascertaining his object, and that he does it
with kind intention, and not out of insolence; much more \[should he
bear with\] a teacher when rebuking him, and a teacher who does not
himself say these things as of authority, nor as one in the position of
a ruler, but in that of a kindly guardian. For we do not say these
things as wishing to exhibit our authority, (for how could we, praying
that we may never come to the trial of them?) but grieving and lamenting
for you.

<span id="v.viii-p66"></span>Forgive me then, and let no man disregard
the bonds of the Church. For it is not man who binds, but Christ who has
given unto us this authority, and makes men lords of this so great
dignity. For we indeed wish to use this power for loosing; or rather, we
wish to have no need even of that, for we wish that there should not be
any bound among us—we are not so miserable and wretched \[as that\] even
though some of us are extreme good-for-nothings. If however we be
compelled \[so to act\], forgive us. For it is not of our own accord,
nor wishing it, but rather out of sorrow for you that are bound that we
put the chains around you. But if any man despise these chains, the time
of judgment will come, which shall teach him. And what comes after I do
not wish to speak of, lest I should wound your minds. For in the first
place indeed we do not wish to be brought into this necessity; but if we
are so brought, we fulfill our own part, we cast around the chains. And
if any man burst through them, I have done my part, and am henceforth
free from blame, and thou wilt have to give account to Him who commanded
me to bind.

<span id="v.viii-p67"></span>For neither, when a king is sitting in
public, if any of the guard who stand beside him be commanded to bind
one of the attendants, and to put the chains around \[him\], and he
should not only thrust this man away, but also break the bonds in
pieces, is it the guard who suffers the insult, and not much more the
King who gave the order. For if He claim as His own, <span
id="page_388">p. 388</span> <span id="v.viii-Page_388"></span> the
things which are done to the faithful, much more will He feel as if
Himself insulted when he is insulted who has been appointed to teach.

<span id="v.viii-p68"></span>But God grant that none of those who are
over this Church should be driven to the necessity of \[inflicting\]
these bonds. For as it is a good thing not to sin, so is it profitable
to endure reproof. Let us then endure the rebuke, and earnestly endeavor
not to sin; and if we should sin let us bear the rebuke. For as it is an
excellent thing not to be wounded, but, if this should happen, to apply
the remedy to the wound, so also in this case.

<span id="v.viii-p69"></span>But God forbid that any man should need
such remedies as these. “But we are persuaded better things of you, and
things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak.” ( [Heb.
6.9](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#009)<span id="v.viii-p69.1"></span> ..md)
But we have discoursed more vehemently for the sake of greater security.
For it is better that I should be suspected by you of being a harsh, and
severe, and self-willed person, than that you should do things not
approved of God. But we trust in God, that this reproof will not be
unserviceable to you, but that ye will be so changed, that these
discourses may be devoted to encomiums on you and to praises: that we
may all be counted worthy to attain to those good things, which God hath
promised to them that love Him in Christ Jesus our Lord, with whom to
the Father together with the Holy Ghost be glory, might, honor, now and
for ever and world without end. Amen.
