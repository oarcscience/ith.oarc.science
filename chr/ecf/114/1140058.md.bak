<span id="iv.lv-p1"></span> <span class="c15"><span
id="iv.lv-p1.1"></span>Homily LIII.</span>

<span id="iv.lv-p2"></span> <span id="iv.lv-p2.1"></span> <span
class="c1"><span id="iv.lv-p2.2"></span>[John viii.
20](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#020.md)<span id="iv.lv-p2.3"></span></span>

<span id="iv.lv-p3"></span>“These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as
He taught in the Temple; and no man laid hands on Him, for His hour was
not yet come.”

<span id="iv.lv-p4"></span> \[1.\] <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.lv-p4.1"></span>Oh</span> the folly of the Jews! seeking Him as
they did before the Passover, and then having found Him in the midst of
them, and having often attempted to take Him by their own or by others’
hands without being able; they were not even so awed by His power, but
set themselves to their wickedness, and desisted not. For it saith, that
they continually made the attempt; “These words spake He in the
treasury, teaching in the Temple; and no man laid hands on Him.” He
spake in the Temple, and in the character of teacher, which was more
adapted to rouse them, and He spake those things because of which they
were stung, and charged Him with making Himself equal to the Father. For
“the witness of two men is true,” proveth this. Yet still “He spake
these words,” It saith, “in the Temple,” in the character of teacher,
“and no man laid hands on Him, for His hour was not yet come”; that is,
it was not yet the fitting time at which He would be crucified. So that
even then  <span id="fr_1461"></span>[1462](#fn_1461.md) the deed done was
not of their power, but of His dispensation, for they had long desired,
but had not been able, nor would they even then have been able, except
He had consented.

<span id="iv.lv-p6"></span> [John
8.21](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#021.md)<span id="iv.lv-p6.1"></span> .
“Then said Jesus unto them, I go My way, and ye shall seek Me.”

<span id="iv.lv-p7"></span>Why saith He this continually? To shame and
terrify their souls; for observe what fear this saying caused in them.
Although they desired to kill Him that they might be rid of Him, they
yet ask, “whither He goeth,” such great things did they imagine from the
matter. He desired also to show them another thing, that the deed would
not be effected through their force; but He showed it to them in a
figure beforehand, and already foretold the Resurrection by these words.

<span id="iv.lv-p8"></span> [John
8.22](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#022.md)<span id="iv.lv-p8.1"></span> .
“Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself?”

<span id="iv.lv-p9"></span>What then doth Christ? To remove their
suspicion, and to show that such an act is sin, He saith,

<span id="iv.lv-p10"></span> [John
8.23](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#023.md)<span id="iv.lv-p10.1"></span> .
“Ye are from beneath.”

<span id="iv.lv-p11"></span>What He saith, is of this kind: “It is no
wonder that ye imagine such things, ye who are carnal men, and have no
spiritual thoughts, but I shall not do anything of the kind, for,

<span id="iv.lv-p12"></span>“I am from above; ye are of the world.”

<span id="iv.lv-p13"></span>Here again He speaketh of their worldly and
carnal imaginations, whence it is clear that the, “I am not of this
world,” doth not mean that He had not taken upon Him flesh, but that He
was far removed from their wickedness. For He even saith, that His
disciples were “not of the world” ( [John
15.19](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#019)<span id="iv.lv-p13.1"></span> .md),
yet they had flesh. As then Paul, when he saith, “Ye are not in the
flesh” ( [Rom. viii. 9](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#009.md) <span
id="iv.lv-p13.2"></span> ), doth not mean that they are incorporeal, so
Christ when He saith, that His disciples are “not of the world,” doth
nothing else than testify to their heavenly wisdom.

<span id="iv.lv-p14"></span> [John
8.24](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#024.md)<span id="iv.lv-p14.1"></span> .
“I said therefore unto you that…if ye believe not that I am He, ye shall
die in your sins.”

<span id="iv.lv-p15"></span> For if He came to take away the sin of the
world, and if it is impossible for men to put that off in any other way
except by the washing, it needs must be that he that believeth not must
depart hence, having  <span id="fr_1462"></span>[1463](#fn_1462.md) the old
man; since he that will not by faith slay and bury that old man, shall
die in him, and shall go away to that place to suffer the punishment of
His former sins. Wherefore He said, “He that believeth not is judged
already” ( [John 3.18](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#018.md)<span
id="iv.lv-p16.3"></span> ); not merely through his not believing, but
because he de <span id="page_189">p. 189</span> <span
id="iv.lv-Page_189"></span> parteth parteth hence having his former sins
upon him.

<span id="iv.lv-p17"></span> [John
8.25](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#025.md)<span id="iv.lv-p17.1"></span> .
“Then said they unto Him, Who art thou?”

<span id="iv.lv-p18"></span>Oh folly! After so long a time, such signs
and teaching, they ask, “Who art thou?” What then saith Christ?

<span id="iv.lv-p19"></span>“The same that I told you from the
beginning.”

<span id="iv.lv-p20"></span>What He saith, is of this kind; “Ye are not
worthy to hear My words at all, much less to learn who I am, for ye say
all that ye do, tempting Me, and giving heed to none of My sayings. And
all this I could now prove against you.” For this is the sense of,

<span id="iv.lv-p21"></span> [John
8.26](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#026.md)<span id="iv.lv-p21.1"></span> .
“I have many things to say and to judge of you.”

<span id="iv.lv-p22"></span>“I could not only prove you guilty, but also
punish you; but He that sent Me, that is, the Father, willeth not this.
For I am come not to judge the world, but to save the world, since God
sent not His Son to judge the world, He saith, but to save the world. (
[John 3.17](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#017.md)<span
id="iv.lv-p22.1"></span> .) If now He hath sent Me for this, and He is
true, with good cause I judge no one now. But these things I speak that
are for your salvation, not what are for your condemnation.” He speaketh
thus, lest they should deem that it was through weakness that on hearing
so much from them He went not to extremities, or that He knew not their
secret thoughts and scoffings.

<span id="iv.lv-p23"></span> [John
8.27](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#027.md)<span id="iv.lv-p23.1"></span> .
“They understood not that He spake to them of the Father.”

<span id="iv.lv-p24"></span>Oh folly! He ceased not to speak concerning
Him, and they knew Him not. Then when after working many signs, and
teaching them, He drew them not to Himself, He next speaketh to them of
the Cross, saying,

<span id="iv.lv-p25"></span> [John
8:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#028.md),
[29](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#029.md)<span id="iv.lv-p25.1"></span> .
“When ye have lifted up the Son of Man, then ye shall know that I Am,
and that I speak not  <span id="fr_1463"></span>[1464](#fn_1463.md) of
Myself, and that He that sent Me is with Me. And the Father hath not
left Me alone.”

<span id="iv.lv-p27"></span> \[2.\] He showeth that He rightly said,
“the same that I said unto you from the beginning.” So little heed they
gave to His words. “When ye have lifted up the Son of Man.” “Do ye not
expect that ye then shall certainly rid yourselves of Me, and slay Me?
But I tell you that then ye shall most know that I Am, by reason of the
miracles, the resurrection, and the destruction (of Jerusalem).” For all
these things were sufficient to manifest His power. He said not, “Then
ye shall know who I am”; for, “when ye shall see,” He saith, “that I
suffer nothing from death, then ye shall know that I Am, that is, the
Christ, the Son of God, who govern  <span
id="fr_1464"></span>[1465](#fn_1464.md) all things, and am not opposed to
Him.”  <span id="fr_1465"></span>[1466](#fn_1465.md) For which cause He
addeth, “and of Myself I speak nothing.” For ye shall know both My power
and My unanimity with the Father. Because the, “of Myself I speak
nothing,” showeth that His Substance differeth not (from that of the
Father), and that He uttereth nothing save that which is in the mind of
the Father. “For when ye have been driven away from your place of
worship, and it is not allowed you even to serve Him as hitherto, then
ye shall know that He doth this to avenge Me, and because He is wroth
with those who would not hear Me.” As though He had said, “Had I been an
enemy and a stranger to God, He would not have stirred up such wrath
against you.” This also Esaias declareth, “He shall give the wicked in
return for His burial” ( [Isa. liii. 9](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#009.md)
<span id="iv.lv-p29.2"></span> , LXX.); and David, “Then shall He speak
unto them in His wrath” ( [Ps. ii. 5](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#005.md)
<span id="iv.lv-p29.3"></span> ); and Christ Himself, “Behold, your
house is left unto you desolate.” ( [Matt. xxiii.
38](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#038) <span id="iv.lv-p29.4"></span> ..md)
And His parables declare the same thing when He saith, “What shall the
Lord of that vineyard do to those husbandmen? He shall miserably destroy
those wicked men.” ( [Matt. 21:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#040.md),
[41](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#041)<span id="iv.lv-p29.5"></span> ..md)
Seest thou that everywhere He speaketh thus, because He is not yet
believed? But if He will destroy them, as He will, (for, “Bring hither,”
It saith, “those which would not that I should reign over them, and slay
them,”) wherefore saith He that the deed is not His, but His Father’s?
He addresseth Himself to their weakness, and at the same time honoreth
Him that begat Him. Wherefore He said not, “I leave your house
desolate,” but, it “is left”; He hath put it impersonally. But by
saying, “How often would I have gathered your children together—and ye
would not,” and then adding, “is left,” He showeth that He wrought the
desolation. “For since,” He telleth them, “when ye were benefited and
healed of your infirmities, ye would not know Me, ye shall know by being
punished who I am.”

<span id="iv.lv-p30"></span>“And the Father is with Me.” That they may
not deem the “who sent Me” to be a mark of inferiority, He saith, “is
with Me”; the first belongeth to the Dispensation, the second to the
Godhead.

<span id="iv.lv-p31"></span>“And He hath not left Me alone,” for I do
always those things that please Him.

<span id="iv.lv-p32"></span>Again He hath brought down His discourse to
a humbler strain, continually setting Himself against that which they
asserted, that He was not of God, and that He kept not the Sabbath. To
this He replieth, “I do always those things that are pleasing unto Him”;
showing that it was pleasing unto Him even that the Sabbath should be
broken. So, for instance, just before <span id="page_190">p. 190</span>
<span id="iv.lv-Page_190"></span> the Crucifixion He said, “Think ye
that I cannot call upon My Father?” ( [Matt. xxvi.
53](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#053) <span id="iv.lv-p32.1"></span> ..md)
And yet by merely saying, “Whom seek ye?” ( [John
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#004.md),
[6](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#006)<span id="iv.lv-p32.2"></span> .md) He
cast them down backwards. Why then saith He not, “Think ye that I cannot
destroy you,” when He had proved this by deed? He condescendeth to their
infirmity. For He took great pains to show that He did nothing contrary
to the Father. Thus He speaketh rather after the manner of a man; and as
“He hath not left Me alone,” was spoken, so also was the, “I do always
those things that are pleasing unto Him.”

<span id="iv.lv-p33"></span> [John
8.30](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#030.md)<span id="iv.lv-p33.1"></span> .
“As He spake these words, many believed on Him.”

<span id="iv.lv-p34"></span>When He brought down His speech to a lowly
strain, many believed on Him. Dost thou still ask wherefore He speaketh
humbly? Yet the Evangelist clearly alluded to this when he said, “As He
spake these things, many believed on Him.” By this all but proclaiming
aloud to us, “Oh hearer, be not confounded if thou hear any lowly
expression, for they who after such high teaching were not yet persuaded
that He was of the Father, were with good reason made to hear humbler
words, that they might believe.” And this is an excuse for those things
which shall be spoken in a humble way. They believed then, yet not as
they ought, but carelessly and as it were by chance, being pleased and
refreshed by the humility of the words. For that they had not perfect
faith the Evangelist shows by their speeches after this, in which they
insult Him again. And that these are the very same persons he has
declared by saying,

<span id="iv.lv-p35"></span> [John
8.31](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#031.md)<span id="iv.lv-p35.1"></span> .
“Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on Him, If ye continue in
My word.”

<span id="iv.lv-p36"></span>Showing that they had not yet received His
doctrine, but only gave heed unto His words. Wherefore He speaketh more
sharply. Before He merely said, “Ye shall seek Me” ( [John
7.34](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#034)<span id="iv.lv-p36.1"></span> .md),
but now He addeth what is more, “Ye shall die in your sins.” ( [John
8.21](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#021)<span id="iv.lv-p36.2"></span> ..md)
And He showeth how; “because ye cannot when ye are come to that place
afterwards entreat Me.”

<span id="iv.lv-p37"></span> “These things which I speak unto the
world.”  <span id="fr_1466"></span>[1467](#fn_1466.md) By these words He
showed that He was now going forth to the Gentiles. But because they
still knew not that He spake to them of the Father, He again speaketh of
Him, and the Evangelist hath put the reason of the humility of the
expressions.

<span id="iv.lv-p39"></span>\[3.\] If now we will thus search the
Scriptures, exactly and not carelessly, we shall be able to attain unto
our salvation; if we continually dwell upon them, we shall learn right
doctrine and a perfect life. For although a man be very hard, and
stubborn, and proud, and profit nothing at other times, yet at least he
shall gain fruit from this time, and receive benefit, if not so great as
to admit of his being sensible of it, still he shall receive it. For if
a man who passes by an ointment-maker’s shop, or sitteth in one, is
impregnated with the perfume even against his will, much more is this
the case with one who cometh to church. For as idleness is born of
idleness, so too from working is generated a ready mind. Although thou
art full of ten thousand sins, although thou art impure, shun not the
tarrying here. “Wherefore,” it may be said, “when hearing I do not?” It
is no small profit to deem one’s self wretched; this fear is not
useless, this dread is not unseasonable. If only thou groanest that,
“hearing I do not,” thou wilt certainly come also to the doing at some
time or other. For it cannot be that he who speaks with God, and hears
God speak, should not profit. We compose ourselves at once and wash our
hands when we desire to take the Bible into them. Seest thou even before
the reading what reverence is here? And if we go on with exactness, we
shall reap great advantage. For we should not, unless it served to place
the soul in reverence, have washed our hands; and a woman if she be
unveiled straightway puts on her veil, giving proof of internal
reverence, and a man if he be covered bares his head. Seest thou how the
outward behavior proclaims the inward reverence? Then moreover he that
sits to hear groans often, and condemns his present life.

<span id="iv.lv-p40"></span>Let us then, beloved, give heed to the
Scriptures, and if no other part be so, let the Gospels at least be the
subjects of our earnest care, let us keep them in our hands. For
straightway when thou hast opened the Book thou shalt see the name of
Christ there, and shalt hear one say, “The birth of Jesus Christ was on
this wise. When His mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, she was found
with Child of the Holy Ghost.” ( [Matt. i.
18](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#018) <span id="iv.lv-p40.1"></span> ..md)
He that heareth this will immediately desire virginity, will marvel at
the Birth, will be freed from earthly things. It is not a little thing
when thou seest the Virgin deemed worthy of the Spirit, and an Angel
talking with her. And this upon the very surface; but if thou
perseverest to go on unto the end, thou shalt loathe all that pertains
to this life, shalt mock at all worldly things. If thou art rich, thou
shalt think nothing of wealth, when thou hearest that she who was (the
wife) of a carpenter, and of humble family, became the mother of thy
Lord. If thou art poor thou shalt not be ashamed of thy poverty, when
thou hearest that the Creator of the world was not ashamed of the
meanest dwelling. Considering this, thou <span id="page_191">p.
191</span> <span id="iv.lv-Page_191"></span> wilt not rob, thou wilt not
covet, thou wilt not take the goods of others, but wilt rather be a
lover of poverty, and despise wealth. And if this be the case, thou
shalt banish all evil. Again, when thou seest Him lying in a manger,
thou wilt not be anxious to put golden garments about thy child, or to
cause thy wife’s couch to be inlaid with silver. And if thou carest not
for these things, thou wilt not do either the deeds of covetousness and
rapine, which are caused by them. Many other things you may gain which I
cannot separately enumerate, but they will know who have made the trial.
Wherefore I exhort you both to obtain Bibles, and to retain together
with the Bibles the sentiments they set forth, and to write them in your
minds. The Jews because they gave no heed were commanded to suspend
their books from their hands;  <span
id="fr_1467"></span>[1468](#fn_1467.md) but we place them not even in our
hands but in our house, when we ought to stamp them on our heart. Thus
cleansing our present life, we shall obtain the good things that are to
come to which may we all attain, through the grace and lovingkindness of
our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom and with whom, to the Father and the Holy
Ghost be glory, now and ever, and world without end. Amen.
