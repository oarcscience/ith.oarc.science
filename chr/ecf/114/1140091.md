<span id="iv.lxxxviii-p3"></span>“Then the disciples went away again
unto their own home. But Mary stood without at the sepulcher, weeping.”

<span id="iv.lxxxviii-p4"></span> \[1.\] <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.lxxxviii-p4.1"></span>Full</span> of feeling somehow is the
female sex, and more  <span id="fr_2527"></span>[2528](#fn_2527.md)
inclined to pity. I say this, lest thou shouldest wonder how it could be
that Mary wept bitterly at the tomb, while Peter was in no way so
affected. For, “The disciples,” it saith, “went away unto their own
home”; but she stood shedding tears. Because hers was a feeble nature,
and she as yet knew not accurately the account of the Resurrection;
whereas they having seen the linen clothes and believed, departed to
their own homes in astonishment. And wherefore went they not straightway
to Galilee, as had been commanded them before the Passion? They waited
for the others, perhaps, and besides they were yet at the height of
their amazement. These then went their way: but she stood at the place,
for, as I have said, even the sight of the tomb tended greatly to
comfort her. At any rate, thou seest her, the more to ease her grief,
stooping down,  <span id="fr_2528"></span>[2529](#fn_2528.md) and desiring
to behold the place where the body lay. And therefore she received no
small reward for this her great zeal. For what the disciples saw not,
this saw the woman first, Angels  <span
id="fr_2529"></span>[2530](#fn_2529.md) sitting, the one at the feet, the
other at the head, in white; even the dress  <span
id="fr_2530"></span>[2531](#fn_2530.md) was full of much radiance  <span
id="fr_2531"></span>[2532](#fn_2531.md) and joy. Since the mind of the
woman was not sufficiently elevated to accept the Resurrection from the
proof of the napkins, something more takes place, she beholdeth
something more; Angels sitting in shining garments, so as to raise her
thus awhile from her passionate sorrow, and to comfort her. But they
said nothing to her concerning the Resurrection, yet is she gently led
forward in this doctrine. She saw countenances bright and unusual; she
saw shining garments, she heard a sympathizing voice. For what saith
(the Angel)?

<span id="iv.lxxxviii-p10"></span> [John
20.13](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#013.md)<span
id="iv.lxxxviii-p10.1"></span> . “Woman, why weepest thou?”

<span id="iv.lxxxviii-p11"></span>By all these circumstances, as though
a door was being opened for her, she was led by little and little to the
knowledge of the Resurrection. And the manner of their sitting invited
her to question them, for they showed that they knew what had taken
place; on which account they did not sit together either, but apart from
one another. For because it was not likely that she would dare at once
to question them, both by questioning her, and by the manner of their
sitting, they bring her to converse. What then saith she? She speaks
very warmly and affectionately;

<span id="iv.lxxxviii-p12"></span> “They  <span
id="fr_2532"></span>[2533](#fn_2532.md) have taken away my Lord, and I know
not where they have laid Him.”

<span id="iv.lxxxviii-p14"></span> “What sayest thou?  Knowest thou not
yet anything concerning the Resurrection, but dost thou still form
fancies about His being laid  <span id="fr_2533"></span>[2534](#fn_2533.md)
?” Seest thou how she had not yet received the sublime doctrine?

<span id="iv.lxxxviii-p16"></span> [John
20.14](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#014.md)<span
id="iv.lxxxviii-p16.1"></span> . “And when she had thus said, she turned
herself back.”  <span id="fr_2534"></span>[2535](#fn_2534.md)

<span id="iv.lxxxviii-p18"></span> And by what kind of consequence is
it, that she having spoken to them, and not having yet heard anything
from them, turned back? Methinks that while she was speaking, Christ
suddenly appearing behind her, struck the Angels with awe; and that they
having beheld their Ruler,  <span id="fr_2535"></span>[2536](#fn_2535.md)
showed immediately by their bearing, their look, their movements, that
they saw the Lord;  <span id="fr_2536"></span>[2537](#fn_2536.md) and this
drew the woman’s attention, and caused her to turn herself backwards. To
them then He appeared on this wise, but not so to the woman, in order
not at the first sight to terrify her, but in a meaner and ordinary
form, as is clear from her supposing that He was the gardener. It was
meet to lead one of so lowly a mind to high matters, not all at once,
but gently. He therefore in turn asketh her,

<span id="iv.lxxxviii-p21"></span> [John
20.15](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#015.md)<span
id="iv.lxxxviii-p21.1"></span> . “Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest
thou?”

<span id="iv.lxxxviii-p22"></span>This showed that He knew what she
wished to ask, and led her to make answer. And the woman, understanding
this, doth not again mention the name of Jesus, but as though her
questioner knew the subject of her enquiry replies,

<span id="iv.lxxxviii-p23"></span> “Sir,  <span
id="fr_2537"></span>[2538](#fn_2537.md) if thou have borne him hence, tell
me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.”

<span id="iv.lxxxviii-p25"></span>Again she speaks of laying down, and
taking away, and carrying, as though speaking of a corpse. But her
meaning is this; “If ye have borne him hence for fear of the Jews, tell
me, <span id="page_322">p. 322</span> <span
id="iv.lxxxviii-Page_322"></span> and I will take him.” Great is the
kindness and loving affection of the woman, but as yet there is nothing
lofty with her.  <span id="fr_2538"></span>[2539](#fn_2538.md) Wherefore He
now setteth the matter before her, not by appearance, but by Voice. For
as He was at one time known to the Jews, and at another time unperceived
 <span id="fr_2539"></span>[2540](#fn_2539.md) though present; so too in
speaking, He, when He chose, then made Himself known; as also when He
said to the Jews, “Whom seek ye?” they knew neither the Countenance nor
the Voice until He chose. And this was the case here. And He named her
name only,  <span id="fr_2540"></span>[2541](#fn_2540.md) reproaching and
blaming her that she entertained such fancies concerning One who lived.
But how was it that,

<span id="iv.lxxxviii-p29"></span> [John
20.16](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#016.md)<span
id="iv.lxxxviii-p29.1"></span> . “She turned herself, and saith,”  <span
id="fr_2541"></span>[2542](#fn_2541.md) if so be that He was speaking to
her? It seems to me, that after having said, “Where have ye laid him?”
she turned to the Angels to ask why they were astonished, and that then
Christ, by calling her by name, turned her to Himself from them, and
revealed Himself by His Voice; for when He called her “Mary,” then she
knew Him; so that the recognition was not by His appearance, but by His
Voice. And if any say, “Whence is it clear that the Angels were
awestruck, and that on this account the woman turned herself,” they will
in this place say, “whence is it clear that she would have touched Him,
and fallen at His feet?” Now as this is clear from His saying, “Touch Me
not,” so is the other clear from its saying, that she turned herself.
But wherefore, said He,

<span id="iv.lxxxviii-p31"></span> [John
20.17](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#017.md)<span
id="iv.lxxxviii-p31.1"></span> . “Touch Me not”?

<span id="iv.lxxxviii-p32"></span>\[2.\] Some assert, that she asked for
spiritual grace, because she had heard Him when with the disciples say,
“If I go to the Father, ‘I will ask Him, and He shall give you another
Comforter.’” ( [John 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#003.md),
[16](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#016.md)<span
id="iv.lxxxviii-p32.1"></span> .) But how could she who was not present
with the disciples have heard this? Besides, such an imagination is far
from the meaning here. And how should she ask, when He had not yet gone
to the Father? What then is the sense? Methinks that she wished still to
converse with Him as before, and that in her joy she perceived nothing
great in Him, although He had become far more excellent in the Flesh. To
lead her therefore from this idea, and that she might speak to Him with
much awe, (for neither with the disciples doth He henceforth appear so
familiar as before,) He raiseth her thoughts, that she should give more
reverent heed to Him. To have said, “Approach Me not as ye did before,
for matters are not in the same state, nor shall I henceforth be with
you in the same way,” would have been harsh and high-sounding; but the
saying,

<span id="iv.lxxxviii-p33"></span> “I am not yet ascended to the  <span
id="fr_2542"></span>[2543](#fn_2542.md) Father,” though not painful to
hear, was the saying of One declaring the same thing. For by saying, “I
am not yet ascended,” He showeth that He hasteth and presseth thither;
and that it was not meet that One about to depart thither, and no longer
to converse with men, should be looked on with the same feelings as
before. And the sequel shows that this is the case.

<span id="iv.lxxxviii-p35"></span> “Go and say unto the brethren, that I
go  <span id="fr_2543"></span>[2544](#fn_2543.md) unto My Father, and your
Father, unto My God and your God.”

<span id="iv.lxxxviii-p37"></span> Yet He was not about to do so
immediately, but after forty days. How then saith He this? With a desire
to raise their minds, and to persuade them that He departeth into the
heavens. But the, “To My Father and your Father, to My God, and your
God,” belongs to the Dispensation,  <span
id="fr_2544"></span>[2545](#fn_2544.md) since the “ascending” also belongs
to His Flesh. For He speaketh these words to one who had no high
thoughts. “Is then the Father His in one way, and ours in another?”
Assuredly then He is. For if He is God of the righteous in a manner
different from that in which He is God of other men, much more in the
case of the Son and us. For because He had said, “Say to the brethren,”
in order that they might not imagine any equality from this, He showed
the difference. He was about to sit on His Father’s throne, but they to
stand by.  <span id="fr_2545"></span>[2546](#fn_2545.md) So that albeit in
His Subsistence according to the Flesh He became our Brother, yet in
Honor He greatly differed from  <span
id="fr_2546"></span>[2547](#fn_2546.md) us, it cannot even be told how
much.

<span id="iv.lxxxviii-p41"></span> [John
20.18](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#018.md)<span
id="iv.lxxxviii-p41.1"></span> . “She therefore departeth, bearing these
tidings to the disciples.”  <span id="fr_2547"></span>[2548](#fn_2547.md)

<span id="iv.lxxxviii-p43"></span> So great a good is perseverance and
endurance. But how was it that they did not any more grieve when He was
about to depart, nor speak as they had done before? At that time they
were affected in such a way, as supposing that He was about to die; but
now that He was risen again, what reason had they to grieve? Moreover,
Mary reported His appearance and His words, which were enough to comfort
them. Since then it was likely that the disciples on hearing these
things would either not believe the woman, or, believing, would grieve
that He had not deemed them worthy of the vision, though He promised to
meet them in Galilee; in order that they might not by dwelling on this
be unsettled,  <span id="fr_2548"></span>[2549](#fn_2548.md) He let not a
single day pass, but having brought them to a state of longing, by their
knowledge that He was risen, and by what <span id="page_323">p.
323</span> <span id="iv.lxxxviii-Page_323"></span> they heard from the
woman, when they were thirsting to see Him, and were greatly afraid,
(which thing itself especially made their yearning greater,) He then,
when it was evening, presented  <span
id="fr_2549"></span>[2550](#fn_2549.md) Himself before them, and that very
marvelously.  <span id="fr_2550"></span>[2551](#fn_2550.md) And why did He
appear in the “evening”? Because it was probable that they would then
especially be very fearful. But the marvel was, why they did not suppose
Him to be an apparition; for He entered, “when the doors were shut,” and
suddenly. The chief cause was, that the woman beforehand had wrought
great faith in them; besides, He showed His countenance to them clear
and mild. He came not by day, in order that all might be collected
together. For great was the amazement; for neither did He knock at the
door but all at once stood in the midst, and showed His side and His
hands.  <span id="fr_2551"></span>[2552](#fn_2551.md) At the same time also
by His Voice He smoothed their tossing thought, by saying,

<span id="iv.lxxxviii-p48"></span> [John
20.19](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#019.md)<span
id="iv.lxxxviii-p48.1"></span> . “Peace be unto you.”

<span id="iv.lxxxviii-p49"></span> That is, “Be not troubled”; at the
same time reminding them of the word which He spake to them before the
Crucifixion, “My peace I leave  <span
id="fr_2552"></span>[2553](#fn_2552.md) unto you” ( [John
14.27](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#027.md)<span
id="iv.lxxxviii-p50.2"></span> ); and again, “In me ye have  <span
id="fr_2553"></span>[2554](#fn_2553.md) peace, but” “in the world ye shall
have tribulation.” ( [John 16.33](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#033.md)<span
id="iv.lxxxviii-p51.3"></span> .)

<span id="iv.lxxxviii-p52"></span> [John
20.20](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#020.md)<span
id="iv.lxxxviii-p52.1"></span> . “Then were the disciples glad when they
saw the Lord.”

<span id="iv.lxxxviii-p53"></span>Seest thou the words issuing in deeds?
For what He said before the Crucifixion, that “I will see you again, and
your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you” ( [John
16.22](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#022.md)<span
id="iv.lxxxviii-p53.1"></span> ), this He now  <span
id="fr_2554"></span>[2555](#fn_2554.md) accomplished in deed; but all these
things led them to a most exact faith. For since they had a truceless
war with the Jews, He continually repeated the, “Peace be unto you,”
 <span id="fr_2555"></span>[2556](#fn_2555.md) giving them, to
counterbalance the war, the consolation. And so this was the first word
that He spake to them after the Resurrection, (wherefore also Paul
continually saith, “Grace be unto you and peace,”) and to women He
giveth good tidings of joy,  <span id="fr_2556"></span>[2557](#fn_2556.md)
because that sex was in sorrow, and had received this as the first
curse. Therefore He giveth good tidings suitable respectively, to men,
peace, because of their war; joy to women, because of their sorrow. Then
having put away all painful things, He telleth of the successes  <span
id="fr_2557"></span>[2558](#fn_2557.md) of the Cross, and these were the
“peace.” “Since then all hindrances have been removed,” He saith, “and I
have made My  <span id="fr_2558"></span>[2559](#fn_2558.md) victory
glorious, and all hath been achieved,” (then He saith afterwards,)

<span id="iv.lxxxviii-p59"></span> [John
20.21](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#021.md)<span
id="iv.lxxxviii-p59.1"></span> . “As My Father hath sent Me, so send I
you.”

<span id="iv.lxxxviii-p60"></span>“Ye have no difficulty, owing to what
hath already come to pass, and to the dignity of Me who send you.” Here
He lifteth up their souls, and showeth them their great cause of
confidence, if so be that they were about to undertake His work. And no
longer is an appeal made to the Father, but with authority He giveth to
them the power. For,

<span id="iv.lxxxviii-p61"></span> [John
20:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#022.md),
[23](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#023.md)<span
id="iv.lxxxviii-p61.1"></span> . “He breathed on them, and said,  <span
id="fr_2559"></span>[2560](#fn_2559.md) Receive ye the Holy Ghost.
Whosesoever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them, and whosesoever
sins ye retain, they are retained.”

<span id="iv.lxxxviii-p63"></span> As a king sending forth governors,
gives power to cast  <span id="fr_2560"></span>[2561](#fn_2560.md) into
prison and to deliver from it, so in sending these forth, Christ
investeth them with the same power. But how saith He, “If I go not away,
He  <span id="fr_2561"></span>[2562](#fn_2561.md) will not come” ( [John
16.7](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#007.md)<span
id="iv.lxxxviii-p65.3"></span> ), and yet giveth them the Spirit? Some
say that He gave not the Spirit, but rendered them fit to receive It, by
breathing on them. For if Daniel when he saw an Angel was afraid, what
would not they have suffered when they received that unspeakable Gift,
unless He had first made them learners? Wherefore He said not, “Ye have
received the Holy Ghost,” but, “Receive ye the Holy Ghost.” Yet one will
not be wrong in asserting that they then also received some spiritual
power and grace; not so as to raise the dead, or to work miracles, but
so as to remit sins. For the gifts of the Spirit are of different kinds;
wherefore He added, “Whosesoever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto
them,” showing what kind of power He was giving. But in the other case,
 <span id="fr_2562"></span>[2563](#fn_2562.md) after forty  <span
id="fr_2563"></span>[2564](#fn_2563.md) days, they received the power of
working miracles. Wherefore He saith, “Ye shall receive power, after
that the Holy Ghost is come  <span id="fr_2564"></span>[2565](#fn_2564.md)
upon you, and ye shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all
Judæa.” ( [Acts i. 8](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#008.md) <span
id="iv.lxxxviii-p68.3"></span> .) And witnesses they became by means of
miracles, for unspeakable is the grace of the Spirit and multiform the
gift. But this comes to pass, that thou mayest learn that the gift and
the power of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, is One. For things
which appear to be peculiar to the Father, these are seen also to belong
to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost. “How then,” saith some one, “doth
none come to the Son, ‘except the Father draw him’?” ( [John
6.44](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#044.md)<span
id="iv.lxxxviii-p68.4"></span> .) Why, this very <span id="page_324">p.
324</span> <span id="iv.lxxxviii-Page_324"></span> thing is shown to
belong to the Son also. “I,” He saith, “am the Way: no man cometh unto
the Father but by Me.” ( [John
14.6](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#006.md)<span
id="iv.lxxxviii-p68.5"></span> .) And observe that it belongeth to the
Spirit also; for “No man can call Jesus Christ Lord,  <span
id="fr_2565"></span>[2566](#fn_2565.md) but by the Holy Ghost.” ( [1 Cor.
xii. 3](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#003.md) <span
id="iv.lxxxviii-p69.3"></span> .) Again, we see that the Apostles were
given to the Church at one time by the Father, at another by the Son, at
another by the Holy Ghost, and that the “diversities of gifts” ( [1 Cor.
xii. 4](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#004.md) <span
id="iv.lxxxviii-p69.4"></span> ) belong to the Father, the Son, and the
Holy Ghost.

<span id="iv.lxxxviii-p70"></span>\[4.\] Let us then do all we can to
have the Holy Spirit with ourselves, and let us treat with much honor
those into whose hands its operation hath been committed. For great is
the dignity of the priests. “Whosesoever sins,” it saith, “ye remit,
they are remitted unto them”; wherefore also Paul saith, “Obey them that
have the rule over you, and submit yourselves.” ( [Heb. xiii.
17](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#017.md) <span
id="iv.lxxxviii-p70.1"></span> .) And hold them very exceedingly in
honor; for thou indeed carest about thine own affairs, and if thou
orderest them well, thou givest  <span
id="fr_2566"></span>[2567](#fn_2566.md) no account for others, but the
priest even if he rightly order his own life, if he have not an anxious
care for thine, yea and that of all those around him, will depart with
the wicked into hell; and often when not betrayed by his own conduct, he
perishes by yours, if he have not rightly performed all his part.
Knowing therefore the greatness of the danger, give them a large share
of your goodwill; which Paul also implied when he said, “For they watch
for your souls,” and not simply so, but, “as they that shall give
account.” ( [Heb. xiii. 17](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#017.md) <span
id="iv.lxxxviii-p71.3"></span> .) They ought therefore to receive great
attention from you; but if you join with the rest in trampling upon
them, then neither shall your affairs be in a good condition. For while
the steersman continues in good courage, the crew also will be in
safety; but if he be tired out by their reviling him and showing
ill-will against him, he cannot watch equally well, or retain his skill,
and without intending it, throws them into ten thousand mischiefs. And
so too the priest, if he enjoy honor  <span
id="fr_2567"></span>[2568](#fn_2567.md) from you, will be able well to
order your affairs; but if ye throw them into despondency, ye weaken
their hands, and render them, as well as yourselves, an easy prey to the
waves, although they be very courageous. Consider what Christ saith
concerning the Jews. “The Scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses’ seat;
all therefore whatsoever they bid  <span
id="fr_2568"></span>[2569](#fn_2568.md) you to do, do ye.” ( [Matt.
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#002.md),
[3](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#003.md)<span id="iv.lxxxviii-p73.3"></span>
.) Now we have not to say, “the priests sit on Moses’ seat,” but “on
that of Christ”; for they have successively received His doctrine.
Wherefore also Paul saith, “We are ambassadors for Christ, as though God
did beseech you by us.” ( [2 Cor. v.
20](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#020.md) <span
id="iv.lxxxviii-p73.4"></span> .) See ye not that in the case of Gentile
rulers, all bow to them, and oftentimes even persons superior in family,
in life, in intelligence, to those who judge them? yet still because of
him who hath given them, they consider none of these things, but respect
the decision of their governor, whosoever he be that receives the rule
over them. Is there then such fear when man appoints, but when God
appointeth do we despise him who is appointed, and abuse him, and
besmirch him with ten thousand reproaches, and though forbidden to judge
our brethren, do we sharpen our tongue against our priests? And how can
this deserve excuse, when we see not the beam in our own eye, but are
bitterly over-curious about the mote in another’s? Knowest thou not that
by so judging thou makest thine own judgment the harder? And this I say
not as approving of those who exercise their priesthood unworthily, but
as greatly pitying and weeping for them; yet do I not on this account
allow that it is right that they should be judged by those over whom
they are set.  <span id="fr_2569"></span>[2570](#fn_2569.md) And although
their life be very much spoken against, thou, if thou take heed to
thyself, wilt not be harmed at all  <span
id="fr_2570"></span>[2571](#fn_2570.md) in respect of the things committed
to them  <span id="fr_2571"></span>[2572](#fn_2571.md) by God. For if He
caused a voice to be uttered by an ass, and bestowed spiritual blessings
by a diviner, working by the foolish mouth and impure tongue of Balaam,
in behalf of the offending Jews, much more for the sake of you the
right-minded  <span id="fr_2572"></span>[2573](#fn_2572.md) will He, though
the priests be exceedingly vile, work all the things that are His, and
will send the Holy Ghost. For neither doth the pure draw down that
Spirit by his own purity, but it is grace that worketh all. “For all,”
it saith, “is for your sake,  <span id="fr_2573"></span>[2574](#fn_2573.md)
whether it be Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas.” ( [1 Cor.
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#022.md),
[23](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#023.md)<span
id="iv.lxxxviii-p78.3"></span> .) For the things which are placed in the
hands of the priest it is with God alone to give; and however far human
wisdom may reach, it will appear inferior to that grace. And this I say,
not in order that we may order our own life carelessly, but that when
some of those set over you are careless livers, you the ruled may not
often heap up evil for yourselves. But why speak I of priests? Neither
Angel nor Archangel can do anything with regard to what is given from
God; but the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, dispenseth all, while
the priest lends his tongue and affords his hand. For neither would it
be just that through the wickedness of another, those who come in faith
to the symbols of their salvation should be harmed. Knowing all these
things, let us fear God, and hold His priests in honor, paying them all
reverence; that both for our own good deeds, and <span id="page_325">p.
325</span> <span id="iv.lxxxviii-Page_325"></span> the attention shown
to them, we may receive a great return from God, through the grace and
lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, with whom to the Father and the
Holy Ghost be glory, dominion, and honor, now and ever, and world
without end. Amen.
