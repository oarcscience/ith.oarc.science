<span id="v.xxi-p3"></span> *“For Christ is not entered into the holy
places made with hands, which are the figures*  <span
id="fr_3097"></span>[3098](#fn_3097.md) *of the true, but into Heaven
itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us. Nor yet that He
should offer Himself often, as the High Priest entereth into the Holy
Place every year with blood of others, for then must He often have
suffered since the foundation of the world. But now, once,*  <span
id="fr_3098"></span>[3099](#fn_3098.md) *in the end of the world hath He
appeared to put away*  <span id="fr_3099"></span>[3100](#fn_3099.md) *sin
by the sacrifice of Himself.”*

<span id="v.xxi-p7"></span> \[1.\] <span class="c11"><span
id="v.xxi-p7.1"></span>The</span> Jews greatly prided themselves on the
temple and the tabernacle. Wherefore they said, “The temple of the Lord,
The temple of the Lord, The temple of the Lord.” ( [Jer. vii.
4](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#004) <span id="v.xxi-p7.2"></span> ..md) For
nowhere else in the earth was such a temple constructed as this, either
for costliness, or beauty, or anything else. For God who ordained it,
commanded that it should be made with great magnificence, because they
also were more attracted and urged on by material things. For it had
bricks of gold in the walls; and any one who wishes may learn this in
the second \[book\] of Kings, and in Ezekiel, and how many talents of
gold were then expended.

<span id="v.xxi-p8"></span>But the second \[temple\] was a more glorious
building, both on account of its beauty, and in all other respects. Nor
was it reverenced for this reason only, but also from its being One. For
they were wont to resort thither from the uttermost parts of the earth,
whether from Babylon or from Ethiopia. And Luke shows this when he says
in the Acts: “There were dwelling” there “Parthians, and Medes, and
Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, in Judea and Cappadocia, in
Pontus and Asia, Phrygia and Pamphylia, in Egypt and in the parts of
Libya about Cyrene.” ( [Acts 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#005.md),
[9](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#009.md),
[10](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#010)<span id="v.xxi-p8.1"></span> ..md)
They then who lived in all parts of the world assembled there, and the
fame of the temple was great.

<span id="v.xxi-p9"></span>What then does Paul do? What \[he did\] in
regard to the sacrifices, that also he does here. For as there he set
against \[them\] the death of Christ, so here also he sets the whole
heaven against the temple.

<span id="page_447">p. 447</span> <span id="v.xxi-Page_447"></span>

<span id="v.xxi-p10"></span> \[2.\] And not by this alone did he point
out the difference, but also by adding that The Priest is nearer to God:
for he says, “to appear in the presence  <span
id="fr_3100"></span>[3101](#fn_3100.md) of God.” So that he made the matter
august, not only by the \[consideration of\] heaven, but also by \[that
of Christ’s\] entering in \[there\]. For not merely through symbols as
here, but He sees God Himself there.

<span id="v.xxi-p12"></span>Seest thou that condescension through the
lowly things have been said throughout? Why dost thou then any longer
wonder that He intercedes there, where He places Himself as a High
Priest? “Nor yet, that He should offer Himself often, as the High
Priest.”

<span id="v.xxi-p13"></span> “For Christ is not entered into the Holy
Places made with hands” (he says) “which are the figures  <span
id="fr_3101"></span>[3102](#fn_3101.md) of the True.” (These then are true;
and those are figures,  <span id="fr_3102"></span>[3103](#fn_3102.md) for
the temple too has been so arranged,  <span
id="fr_3103"></span>[3104](#fn_3103) as the Heaven of Heavens..md)

<span id="v.xxi-p17"></span> What sayest thou? He who is everywhere
present, and who filleth all things, doth not He “appear”  <span
id="fr_3104"></span>[3105](#fn_3104.md) unless He enter into Heaven? Thou
seest that all these things pertain to the flesh.

<span id="v.xxi-p19"></span> “To appear,” he says, “in the presence of
God for us.” What is “for us”? He went up (he means) with a sacrifice
which had power to propitiate the Father. Wherefore (tell me)? Was He an
enemy? The angels were enemies, He was not an enemy. For that the Angels
were enemies, hear what he says, “He made peace as to things on earth
and things in Heaven.”  <span id="fr_3105"></span>[3106](#fn_3105.md) (
[Col. i. 20](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#020.md) <span
id="v.xxi-p20.3"></span> .) So that He also “entered into Heaven, now to
appear in the presence of God for us.” He “now appeareth,” but “for us.”

<span id="v.xxi-p21"></span> \[3.\] “Nor yet that He should offer
Himself often, as the High Priest entereth into the Holy place every
year with blood of others.” Seest Thou how many are the differences? The
“often” for the “once”; “the blood of others,” for “His own.”  <span
id="fr_3106"></span>[3107](#fn_3106.md) Great is the distance. He is
Himself then both victim and Priest and sacrifice. For if it had not
been so, and it had been necessary to offer many sacrifices, He must
have been many times crucified. “For then,” he says, “He must often have
suffered since the foundation of the world.”

<span id="v.xxi-p23"></span> In this place he has also veiled over
 <span id="fr_3107"></span>[3108](#fn_3107.md) something. “But now once
more in the end of the world.” Why “at the end of the world”? After the
many sins. If therefore, it had taken place at the beginning, then no
one would have believed; and He must not die a second time, all would
have been useless. But since later, there were many transgressions, with
reason He then appeared: which he expresses in another place also,
“Where sin abounded, grace did much more abound. But now once in the end
of the world, hath He appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of
Himself.” ( [Rom. v. 20](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#020.md) <span
id="v.xxi-p24.2"></span> .)

<span id="v.xxi-p25"></span>\[4.\] ( [Heb.
9.27](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#027)<span id="v.xxi-p25.1"></span> .md)
“And as it is appointed  <span id="fr_3108"></span>[3109](#fn_3108.md) unto
men once to die, but after this, the Judgment.” He next says also why He
died once \[only\]: because He became a ransom by one death. “It had
been appointed” (he says) “unto men once to die.” This then is \[the
meaning of\] “He died once,”  <span id="fr_3109"></span>[3110](#fn_3109.md)
for all.  <span id="fr_3110"></span>[3111](#fn_3110.md) (What then? Do we
no longer die that death? We do indeed die, but we do not continue in
it: which is not to die at all. For the tyranny of death, and death
indeed, is when he who dies is never more allowed to return to life. But
when after dying is living, and that a better life, this is not death,
but sleep.) Since then death was to have possession of all, therefore He
died that He might deliver us.

<span id="v.xxi-p29"></span> [Heb.
9.28](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#028.md)<span id="v.xxi-p29.1"></span> .
“So Christ was once  <span id="fr_3111"></span>[3112](#fn_3111.md)
offered.” By whom offered? evidently by Himself. Here he says that He is
not Priest only, but Victim also, and what is sacrificed.  <span
id="fr_3112"></span>[3113](#fn_3112.md) On this account are \[the words\]
“was offered.” “Was once offered” (he says) “to bear  <span
id="fr_3113"></span>[3114](#fn_3113.md) the sins of many.” Why “of many,”
and not “of all”? Because not all believed. For He died indeed for all,
that is His part: for that death was a counterbalance  <span
id="fr_3114"></span>[3115](#fn_3114.md) against the destruction of all men.
But He did not bear the sins of all men, because they were not willing.

<span id="v.xxi-p34"></span> And what is \[the meaning of\] “He bare the
sins”? Just as in the Oblation we bear up our sins and say, “Whether we
have sinned voluntarily or involuntarily, do Thou forgive,”  <span
id="fr_3115"></span>[3116](#fn_3115.md) that is, we make mention of them
first, and then ask for their forgiveness. So also was it done here.
Where has Christ done this? Hear Himself saying, “And for their sakes I
sanctify  <span id="fr_3116"></span>[3117](#fn_3116.md) Myself.” ( [John
xvii. 19](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#019.md) <span
id="v.xxi-p36.7"></span> .) Lo! He bore the sins. He took them from men,
and bore them to the Father; not that He might determine anything <span
id="page_448">p. 448</span> <span id="v.xxi-Page_448"></span> against
them \[mankind\], but that He might forgive them.

<span id="v.xxi-p37"></span>“Unto them that look for Him shall He
appear” (he says) “the second time without sin unto salvation.” What is
“without sin”? it is as much as to say, He sinneth not. For neither did
He die as owing the debt of death, nor yet because of sin. But how
“shall He appear”? To punish, you say. He did not however say this, but
what was cheering; “shall He appear unto them that look for Him, without
sin unto salvation.” So that for the time to come they no longer need
sacrifices to save themselves, but to do this by deeds.

<span id="v.xxi-p38"></span>\[5.\] ( [Heb.
10.1](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#001)<span id="v.xxi-p38.1"></span> ..md)
“For” (he says) “the Law having a shadow of the good things to come, not
the very image of the things”; i.e. not the very reality. For as in
painting, so long as one \[only\] draws the outlines, it is a sort of
“shadow” but when one has added the bright paints and laid in the
colors, then it becomes “an image.” Something of this kind also was the
Law.

<span id="v.xxi-p39"></span> “For” (he says) “the Law having a shadow of
the good things to come, not the very image of the things,” i.e. of the
sacrifice, of the remission: “can never by those sacrifices  <span
id="fr_3117"></span>[3118](#fn_3117.md) with  <span
id="fr_3118"></span>[3119](#fn_3118.md) which they offered continually make
the comers thereunto perfect.” ( [Heb.
10.2-9](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#002)<span id="v.xxi-p41.7"></span> .md)
“For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the
worshipers once purged, should have had no more conscience of sins? But
in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every
year. For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should
take away sins. Wherefore when He cometh into the world, He saith,
Sacrifice and offering Thou wouldest not, but a body hast Thou prepared
Me. In burnt-offerings and sacrifices for sin Thou hast had no pleasure.
Then said I, Lo! I come, in the volume of the book it is written of Me,
to do Thy will, O God. Above when He said, Sacrifice, and offering, and
burnt-offerings, and \[offering\] for sin Thou wouldest not, neither
hadst pleasure therein, which are offered by the Law, then He said, Lo!
I come to do Thy will, O God! He taketh away the first that He may
establish the second.”

<span id="v.xxi-p42"></span> Thou seest again the superabundance \[of
his proofs\]? This sacrifice (he says) is one; whereas the others were
many: therefore they had no strength, because they were many. For, tell
me, what need of many, if one had been sufficient? so that their being
many, and offered “continually,” proves that they \[the worshipers\]
were never made clean. For as a medicine, when it is powerful and
productive of health, and able to remove the disease entirely, effects
all after one application; as, therefore, if being once applied it
accomplishes the whole, it proves its own strength in being no more
applied, and this is its business, to be no more applied; whereas if it
is applied continually, this is a plain proof of its not having
strength. For it is the excellence of a medicine to be applied once, and
not often. So is it in this case also. Why forsooth are they continually
cured with the “same sacrifices”? For if they were set free from all
their sins, the sacrifices would not have gone on being offered every
day. For they had been appointed to be continually offered in behalf of
the whole people, both in the evening and in the day. So that there was
an arraignment of sins, and not a release from sins; an arraignment of
weakness, not an exhibition of strength. For because the first had no
strength, another also was offered: and since this effected nothing,
again another; so that it was an evidence of sins. The “offering” indeed
then, was an evidence of sins, the “continually,” an evidence of
weakness. But with regard to Christ, it was the contrary: He was “once
offered.” The types  <span id="fr_3119"></span>[3120](#fn_3119.md)
therefore contain the figure only, not the power; just as in images, the
image has the figure of the man, not the power. So that the reality and
the type have \[somewhat\] in common with one another. For the figure
exists equally in both, but not the power. So too also is it in respect
of Heaven and of the tabernacle, for the figure was equal: for there was
the Holy of Holies, but the power and the other things were not the
same.

<span id="v.xxi-p44"></span> What is, “He hath appeared to put away sin
by the sacrifice of Himself”?  <span
id="fr_3120"></span>[3121](#fn_3120.md) What is this “putting away”? it is
making contemptible. For sin has no longer any boldness; for it is made
of no effect in that when it ought to have demanded  <span
id="fr_3121"></span>[3122](#fn_3121.md) punishment, it did not demand it:
that is, it suffered violence: when it expected to destroy all men, then
it was itself destroyed.

<span id="v.xxi-p47"></span> “He hath appeared by the sacrifice of
Himself” (he says), that is, “He hath appeared,” unto God, and drawn
near \[unto Him\]. For do not \[think\] because the High Priest was wont
to do this oftentimes in the year.…  <span
id="fr_3122"></span>[3123](#fn_3122.md) So that henceforward this is done
in vain, although <span id="page_449">p. 449</span> <span
id="v.xxi-Page_449"></span> it is done; for what need is there of
medicines where there are no wounds? On this account He ordained
offerings “continually,” because of their want of power, and that a
remembrance of sins might be made.

<span id="v.xxi-p49"></span> \[6.\] What then? do not we offer every
day? We offer indeed, but making a remembrance of His death, and this
 <span id="fr_3123"></span>[3124](#fn_3123.md) \[remembrance\] is one and
not many. How is it one, and not many? Inasmuch as that  <span
id="fr_3124"></span>[3125](#fn_3124.md) \[Sacrifice\] was once for all
offered, \[and\] carried into the Holy of Holies. This is a figure of
that \[sacrifice\] and this remembrance of that.  <span
id="fr_3125"></span>[3126](#fn_3125.md) For we always offer the same,
 <span id="fr_3126"></span>[3127](#fn_3126.md) not one sheep now and
to-morrow another, but always the same thing:  <span
id="fr_3127"></span>[3128](#fn_3127.md) so that the sacrifice is one. And
yet by this reasoning, since the offering is made in many places, are
there many Christs? but Christ is one everywhere, being complete here
and complete there also, one Body.  As then while offered in many
places, He is one body and not many bodies; so also \[He is\] one
sacrifice. He is our High Priest, who offered the sacrifice that
cleanses us. That we offer now also, which was then offered, which
cannot be exhausted. This is done in remembrance of what was then done.
For (saith He) “do this in remembrance of Me.” ( [Luke xxii.
19](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#019) <span id="v.xxi-p54.2"></span> ..md)
It is not another sacrifice, as the High Priest, but we offer  <span
id="fr_3128"></span>[3129](#fn_3128.md) always the same, or rather we
perform a remembrance of a Sacrifice.

<span id="v.xxi-p56"></span> \[7.\] But since I have mentioned this
sacrifice, I wish to say a little in reference to you who have been
initiated; little in quantity, but possessing great force and profit,
for it is not our own, but the words of Divine <span class="c11"><span
id="v.xxi-p56.1"></span>Spirit</span> . What then is it? Many partake of
this sacrifice once in the whole year, others twice; others many times.
Our word then is to all; not to those only who are here, but to those
also who are settled in the desert.  <span
id="fr_3129"></span>[3130](#fn_3129.md) For they partake once in the year,
and often indeed at intervals of two years.

<span id="v.xxi-p58"></span>What then? which shall we approve? those
\[who receive\] once \[in the year\]? those who \[receive\] many times?
those who \[receive\] few times? Neither those \[who receive\] once, nor
those \[who receive\] often, nor those \[who receive\] seldom, but those
\[who come\] with a pure conscience, from a pure heart, with an
irreproachable life. Let such draw near continually; but those who are
not such, not even once. Why, you will ask? Because they receive to
themselves judgment, yea and condemnation, and punishment, and
vengeance. And do not wonder. For as food, nourishing by nature, if
received by a person without appetite, ruins and corrupts all \[the
system\], and becomes an occasion of disease, so surely is it also with
respect to the awful mysteries. Dost thou feast at a spiritual table, a
royal table, and again pollute thy mouth with mire? Dost thou anoint
thyself with sweet ointment, and again fill thyself with ill savors?

<span id="v.xxi-p59"></span> Tell me, I beseech thee, when after a year
thou partakest of the Communion, dost thou think that the Forty Days
 <span id="fr_3130"></span>[3131](#fn_3130.md) are sufficient for thee for
the purifying of the sins of all that time? And again, when a week has
passed, dost thou give thyself up to the former things? Tell me now, if
when thou hast been well for forty days after a long illness, thou
shouldest again give thyself up to the food which caused the sickness,
hast thou not lost thy former labor too? For if natural things are
changed, much more those which depend on choice. As for instance, by
nature we see, and naturally we have healthy eyes; but oftentimes from a
bad habit \[of body\] our power of vision is injured. If then natural
things are changed, much more those of choice. Thou assignest forty days
for the health of the soul, or perhaps not even forty, and dost thou
expect to propitiate God? Tell me, art thou in sport?

<span id="v.xxi-p61"></span>These things I say, not as forbidding you
the one and annual coming, but as wishing you to draw near continually.

<span id="v.xxi-p62"></span> \[8.\] These things have been given to the
holy. This the Deacon also proclaims when he calls on the holy;  <span
id="fr_3131"></span>[3132](#fn_3131.md) even by this call searching the
faults of all. For as in a flock, where many sheep indeed are in good
health, but many are full of the scab, it is needful that these should
be separated from the healthy; so also in the Church: since some sheep
are healthy, and some diseased, by this voice he separates the one from
the other, the priest \[I mean\] going round on all sides by this most
awful cry, and calling and drawing on  <span
id="fr_3132"></span>[3133](#fn_3132.md) the holy. For it is not possible
that a man should know the things of his neighbor, (for “what man,” he
says, “knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in
him?”— [1 Cor. ii. 11](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#011.md) <span
id="v.xxi-p64.3"></span> ): he utters this voice after the whole
sacrifice has been completed, that no person should come to the
spiritual fountain carelessly and in a chance way. For in the case of
the flock also (for nothing prevents us from again using the same
example), the sickly ones we shut up within, and keep them in the dark,
and give them different food, not permitting them to partake either of
pure air, or of simple grass, or of the fountain without \[the fold\].
In this case then also this voice is instead of fetters.

<span id="v.xxi-p65"></span> <span id="page_450">p. 450</span> <span
id="v.xxi-Page_450"></span> Thou canst not say, ‘I did not know, I was
not aware that danger attends the matter.’ Nay surely Paul too
especially testified this. But wilt thou say, ‘I never read it’? This is
not an apology, but even an accusation. Dost thou come into the Church
every day and yet art ignorant of this?

<span id="v.xxi-p66"></span>However, that thou mayest not have even this
excuse to offer, for this cause, with a loud voice, with an awful cry,
like some herald lifting up his hand on high, standing aloft,
conspicuous to all, and after that awful silence crying out aloud, he
invites some, and some he forbids, not doing this with his hand, but
with his tongue more distinctly than with his hand. For that voice,
falling on our ears, just like a hand, thrusts away and casts out some,
and introduces and presents others.

<span id="v.xxi-p67"></span>Tell me then, I beseech \[you\], in the
Olympic games does not the herald stand, calling out with loud and
uplifted voice, saying, “Does any one accuse this man? Is he a slave? Is
he a thief? Is he one of wicked manners?” And yet, those contests for
prizes are not of the soul nor yet of good morals, but of strength and
the body. If then where there is exercise of bodies, much examination is
made about character, how much rather here, where the soul is alone the
combatant. Our herald then even now stands, not holding each person by
the head, and drawing him forward, but holding all together by the head
within; he does not set against them other accusers, but themselves
against themselves. For he says not, “Does any one accuse this man?” but
what? “If any man accuse himself.” For when he says, The Holy things for
the holy, he means this: “If any is not holy, let him not draw near.”

<span id="v.xxi-p68"></span>He does not simply say, “free from sins,”
but, “holy.” For it is not merely freedom from sins which makes a man
holy, but also the presence of the Spirit, and the wealth of good works.
I do not merely wish (he says) that you should be delivered from the
mire, but also that you should be bright and beautiful. For if the
Babylonian King, when he made choice of the youths from the captives,
chose out those who were beautiful in form, and of fair countenance: 
much more is it needful that we, when we stand by the royal table,
should be beautiful in form, \[I mean\] that of the soul, having
adornment of gold, our robe pure, our shoes royal, the face of our soul
well-formed, the golden ornament put around it, even the girdle of
truth. Let such an one as this draw near, and touch the royal cups.

<span id="v.xxi-p69"></span> But if any man clothed in rags, filthy,
squalid, wish to enter in to the royal table, consider how much he will
suffer, the forty days not being sufficient to wash away the offenses
which have been committed in all the time. For if hell is not
sufficient, although it be eternal (for therefore also it *is* eternal),
much more this short time. For we have not shown a strong repentance,
but a weak.

<span id="v.xxi-p70"></span>\[9.\] Eunuchs especially ought to stand by
the King: by eunuchs, I mean those who are clear in their mind, having
no wrinkle nor spot, lofty in mind, having the eye of the soul gentle
and quick-sighted, active and sharp, not sleepy nor supine; full of much
freedom, and yet far from impudence and overboldness, wakeful,
healthful, neither very gloomy and downcast, nor yet dissolute and soft.

<span id="v.xxi-p71"></span>This eye we have it in our own power to
create, and to make it quicksighted and beautiful. For when we direct
it, not to the smoke nor to the dust (for such are all human things),
but to the delicate breeze, to the light air, to things heavenly and
high, and full of much calmness and purity, and of much delight, we
shall speedily restore it, and shall invigorate it, as it luxuriates in
such contemplation. Hast thou seen covetousness and great wealth? do not
thou lift up thine eye thereto. The thing is mire, it is smoke, an evil
vapor, darkness, and great distress and suffocating cares. Hast thou
seen a man cultivating righteousness, content with his own, and having
abundant space for recreation, having anxieties, not fixing his thoughts
on things here? Set \[thine eye\] there, and lift \[it\] up on high; and
thou wilt make it far the most beautiful, and more splendid, feasting it
not with the flowers of the earth, but with those of virtue, with
temperance, moderation, and all the rest. For nothing so troubles the
eye as an evil conscience (“Mine eye,” it is said, “was troubled by
reason of anger”— [Ps. vi. 7](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#007.md) <span
id="v.xxi-p71.1"></span> ); nothing so darkens it. Set it free from this
injury, and thou wilt make it vigorous and strong, ever nourished with
good hopes.

<span id="v.xxi-p72"></span>And may we all make both it and also the
other energies of the soul, such as Christ desires, that being made
worthy of the Head who is set over us, we may depart thither where He
wishes. For He saith, “I will that where I am, they also may be with Me,
that they may behold My glory.” ( [John xvii.
24](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#024) <span id="v.xxi-p72.1"></span> ..md)
Which may we all enjoy in Christ Jesus our Lord, with whom to the Father
together with the Holy Ghost be glory, might, honor, now and for ever
and world without end. Amen.

<span id="v.xxi-p20"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.xxi-p20.1"></span>St. Chrys. understands this passage as meaning
that peace was made between things on earth and those in Heaven, between
us and the Angels. See his Homily on [Col. i.
20](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#020.md)<span id="v.xxi-p20.2"></span> \[pp.
212 sqq. O.T.\]. By introducing this subject of the Father not being
inimical to us, he seems to guard against any misinterpretation of what
he had said, Hom. xvi. \[2\].</span>
