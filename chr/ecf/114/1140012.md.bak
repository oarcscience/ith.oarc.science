<span id="iv.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c15"><span
id="iv.ix-p1.1"></span>Homily VII.</span>

<span id="iv.ix-p2"></span> <span id="iv.ix-p2.1"></span> <span
class="c1"><span id="iv.ix-p2.2"></span>[John i.
9](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#009.md)<span id="iv.ix-p2.3"></span></span>

<span id="iv.ix-p3"></span>“That was the true Light, which lighteth
every man that cometh into the world.”

<span id="iv.ix-p4"></span> \[1.\] <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.ix-p4.1"></span>The</span> reason, O children greatly beloved,
why we entertain you portion by portion with the thoughts taken from the
Scriptures, and do not at once pour all forth to you, is, that the
retaining what is successively set before you may be easy. For even in
building, one who before the first stones are settled lays on others,
constructs  <span id="fr_157"></span>[158](#fn_157.md) a rotten wall
altogether, and easily thrown down: while one who waits that the mortar
may first get hard, and so adds what remains little by little, finishes
the whole house firmly, and makes it strong, not one to last for a short
time, or easily to fall to pieces. These builders we imitate,  <span
id="fr_158"></span>[159](#fn_158.md) and in like manner build up your
souls. For we fear lest, while the first foundation is but newly laid,
the addition of the succeeding speculations  <span
id="fr_159"></span>[160](#fn_159.md) may do harm to the former, through the
insufficiency of the intellect to contain them all at once.

<span id="iv.ix-p8"></span>What now is it that has been read to us
today?

<span id="iv.ix-p9"></span> “That was the true Light, which lighteth
every man that cometh into the world.” For since above in speaking of
John he said, that he came “to bear witness of that Light”; and that he
was sent in these our days;  <span id="fr_160"></span>[161](#fn_160.md)
lest any one at hearing this should, on account of the recent coming of
the witness, conceive some like suspicion concerning Him, who is
witnessed of, he has carried up the imagination, and transported it to
that existence which is before all beginning, which has neither end nor
commencement.

<span id="iv.ix-p11"></span> “And how is it possible,” says one, “that
being a Son, He should possess this (nature)?” We are speaking of God,
and do you ask how? And do you not fear nor shudder? Yet should any one
ask you, “How should our souls and bodies have endless life in the world
to come?  <span id="fr_161"></span>[162](#fn_161.md) ” you will laugh at
the question, on the ground that it does not belong to the intellect of
man to search into such questions, but that he ought only to believe,
and not to be over-curious on the subject mentioned, since he has a
sufficient proof of the saying, in the power of Him who spake it. And if
we say, that He, who created our souls and bodies, and who incomparably
excels all created things, is without beginning, will you require us to
say “How?” Who could assert this to be the act of a well-ordered soul,
or of sound reason? you have heard that “That was the true Light”: why
are you vainly and rashly striving to overshoot  <span
id="fr_162"></span>[163](#fn_162.md) by force of reasoning this Life which
is unlimited? You cannot do it. Why seek what may not be sought? Why be
curious about what is incomprehensible? Why search what is unsearchable?
Gaze upon the very source of the sunbeams. You cannot; yet you are
neither vexed nor impatient at your weakness; how then have you become
so daring and headlong in greater matters? The son of thunder, John who
sounds  <span id="fr_163"></span>[164](#fn_163.md) the spiritual trumpet,
when he had heard from the Spirit the <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.ix-p14.1"></span>was</span> , enquired no farther. And are you,
who share not in his grace, but speak from your own wretched <span
id="page_28">p. 28</span> <span id="iv.ix-Page_28"></span> reasonings,
ambitious to exceed the measure of his knowledge? Then for this very
reason you will never be able even to reach to the measure of his
knowledge. For this is the craft of the devil: he leads away those who
obey him from the limits assigned by God, as though to things much
greater: but when, having enticed us by these hopes, he has cast us out
of the grace of God, he not only gives nothing more, (how can he, devil
as he is?) but does not even allow us to return again to our former
situation, where we dwelt safely and surely, but leads us about in all
directions wandering and not having any standing ground. So he caused
the first created man to be banished from the abode of Paradise. Having
puffed him up with the expectation of greater knowledge and honor, he
expelled him from what he already possessed in security. For he not only
did not become like a god as (the devil) promised him, but even fell
beneath the dominion of death; having not only gained no further
advantage by eating of the tree, but having lost no small portion of the
knowledge which he possessed, through hope of greater knowledge. For the
sense of shame, and the desire to hide himself because of his nakedness,
then came upon him, who before the cheat was superior to all such shame;
and this very seeing himself to be naked, and the need for the future of
the covering of garments, and many other infirmities,  <span
id="fr_164"></span>[165](#fn_164.md) became thenceforth natural to him.
That this be not our case, let us obey God, continue in His
commandments, and not be busy about anything beyond them, that we may
not be cast out from the good things already given us. Thus they have
fared (of whom we speak). For seeking to find a beginning of the Life
which has no beginning, they lost what they might have retained. They
found not what they sought, (this is impossible,) and they fell away
from the true faith concerning the Only-Begotten.

<span id="iv.ix-p16"></span> Let us not then remove the eternal bounds
which our fathers set, but let us ever yield to the laws of the Spirit;
and when we hear that “That was the true Light,” let us seek to discover
nothing more. For it is not possible to pass beyond this saying. Had His
generation been like that of a man, needs must there have been an
interval between the begetter and the begotten; but since it is in a
manner ineffable and becoming God, give up the “before” and the “after,”
for these are the names of points in time, but the Son is the Creator
even of all ages.  <span id="fr_165"></span>[166](#fn_165.md)

<span id="iv.ix-p18"></span>\[2.\] “Then,” says one, “He is not Father,
but brother.” What need, pray? If we had asserted that the Father and
the Son were from a different root, you might have then spoken this
well. But, if we flee this impiety, and say the Father, besides being
without beginning, is Unbegotten also, while the Son, though without
beginning, is Begotten of the Father, what kind of need that as a
consequence of this idea, that unholy assertion should be introduced? 
None at all. For He is an Effulgence: but an effulgence is included in
the idea of the nature whose effulgence it is. For this reason Paul has
called Him so, that you may imagine no interval between the Father and
the Son. ( [Heb. i. 3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003.md) <span
id="iv.ix-p18.1"></span> .) This expression  <span
id="fr_166"></span>[167](#fn_166.md) therefore is declaratory of the point;
but the following part of the proof quoted, corrects an erroneous
opinion which might beset simple men. For, says the Apostle, do not,
because you have heard that he is an Effulgence, suppose that He is
deprived of His proper person; this is impious, and belongs to the
madness of the Sabellians, and of Marcellus’ followers. We say not so,
but that He is also in His proper Person. And for this reason, after
having called Him “Effulgence,” Paul has added that He is “the express
image of His Person” ( [Heb. i. 3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003.md)
<span id="iv.ix-p19.3"></span> .), in order to make evident His proper
Personality, and that He belongs to the same Essence of which He is also
the express image. For, as I before  <span
id="fr_167"></span>[168](#fn_167.md) said, it is not sufficient by a single
expression to set before men the doctrines concerning God, but it is
desirable that we bring many together, and choose from each what is
suitable. So shall we be able to attain to a worthy telling of His
glory, worthy, I mean, as regards our power; for if any should deem
himself able to speak words suitable to His essential worthiness, and be
ambitious to do so, saying, that he knows God as God knows Himself, he
it is who is most ignorant of God.

<span id="iv.ix-p21"></span>Knowing therefore this, let us continue
steadfastly to hold what “they have delivered unto us, which from the
beginning were eye-witnesses, and ministers of the word.” ( [Luke i.
2](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#002) <span id="iv.ix-p21.1"></span> ..md)
And let us not be curious beyond: for two evils will attend those who
are sick of this disease, (curiosity,) the wearying themselves in vain
by seeking what it is impossible to find, and the provoking God by their
endeavors to overturn the bounds set by Him.  Now what anger this
excites, it needs not that you who know should learn from us. Abstaining
therefore from their madness, let us tremble at His words, that He may
continually build us up. For, “upon whom shall I look” ( [Isa. lxvi.
2](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#002.md) <span id="iv.ix-p21.2"></span> ,
LXX.), saith He, “but upon the lowly, and quiet, and who feareth my
words?” Let us then leave this pernicious curiosity, and bruise our
hearts, let us mourn for our sins as Christ commanded, let us be pricked
at heart  <span id="fr_168"></span>[169](#fn_168.md) for our
transgressions, let us reckon up exactly all the wicked deeds, which
<span id="page_29">p. 29</span> <span id="iv.ix-Page_29"></span> in time
past we have dared, and let us earnestly strive to wipe them off in all
kinds of ways.

<span id="iv.ix-p23"></span>Now to this end God hath opened to us many
ways. For, “Tell thou first,” saith He, “thy sins, that thou mayest be
justified” ( [Isa. xliii. 26](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#026.md) <span
id="iv.ix-p23.1"></span>  <span id="fr_169"></span>[170](#fn_169) .md); and
again, “I said, I have declared mine iniquity unto Thee, and Thou hast
taken  <span id="fr_170"></span>[171](#fn_170.md) away the unrighteousness
of my heart” ( [Ps. xxxii. 5](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#005.md) <span
id="iv.ix-p25.1"></span> , LXX.); since a continual accusation and
remembrance of sins contributes not a little to lessen their magnitude.
But there is another more prevailing way than this; to bear malice
against none of those who have offended against us, to forgive their
trespasses to all those who have trespassed against us. Will you learn a
third? Hear Daniel, saying, “Redeem thy sins by almsdeeds, and thine
iniquities by showing mercy to the poor.” ( [Dan. iv.
27](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#027.md) <span id="iv.ix-p25.2"></span> ,
LXX.) And there is another besides this; constancy in prayer, and
persevering attendance on the intercessions  <span
id="fr_171"></span>[172](#fn_171.md) made with God. In like manner fasting
brings to us some, and that not small comfort and release from sins
committed,  <span id="fr_172"></span>[173](#fn_172.md) provided it be
attended with kindness to others, and quenches the vehemence of the
wrath of God. ( [1 Tim. ii. 1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#001.md) <span
id="iv.ix-p27.2"></span> .) For “water will quench a blazing fire, and
by almsdeeds sins are purged away.” ( [Ecclesiasticus
3.30](../../../bib/apo/sir003.htm#030.md)<span id="iv.ix-p27.3"></span> ,
LXX.)

<span id="iv.ix-p28"></span>Let us then travel along all these ways; for
if we give ourselves wholly to these employments, if on them we spend
our time, not only shall we wash off our bygone transgressions, but
shall gain very great profit for the future. For we shall not allow the
devil to assault us with leisure either for slothful living, or for
pernicious curiosity, since by these among other means, and in
consequence of these, he leads us to foolish questions and hurtful
disputations, from seeing us at leisure, and idle, and taking no
forethought for excellency of living. But let us block up this approach
against him, let us watch, let us be sober, that having in this short
time toiled a little, we may obtain eternal goods in endless ages, by
the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ; by whom and with
whom to the Father and the Holy Ghost, be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
