<span id="iv.lviii-p1"></span> <span class="c15"><span
id="iv.lviii-p1.1"></span>Homily LVI.</span>

<span id="iv.lviii-p2"></span> <span id="iv.lviii-p2.1"></span> <span
class="c1"><span id="iv.lviii-p2.2"></span>[John
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#001.md),

id="iv.lviii-p2.3"></span></span>

<span id="iv.lviii-p3"></span>“And as Jesus passed by, He saw a man
which was blind from his birth. And His disciples asked Him, saying,
Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?”

<span id="iv.lviii-p4"></span> \[1.\] “ <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.lviii-p4.1"></span>And</span> as Jesus passed by, He saw a man
which was blind from his birth.” Being full of love for man, and caring
for our salvation, and desiring to stop the mouths of the foolish, He
omitteth nothing of His own part, though there be none to give heed. And
the Prophet knowing this saith, “That Thou mightest be justified when
Thou speakest, and be clear when Thou art judged.” ( [Ps. li.
4](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#004) <span id="iv.lviii-p4.2"></span> ..md) 
Wherefore here, when they would not receive His sublime sayings, but
said that He had a devil, and attempted to kill Him, He went forth from
the Temple, and healed the blind, mitigating their rage by His absence,
and by working the miracle softening their hardness and cruelty, and
establishing His assertions. And He worketh a miracle which was no
common one, but one which took place then for the first time. “Since the
world began,” saith he who was healed, “was it not heard that any man
opened the eyes of one that was born blind.” ( [John
9.32](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#032.md)<span id="iv.lviii-p4.3"></span>
.) Some have, perhaps, opened the eyes of the blind, but of one born
blind never. And that on going out of the Temple, He proceeded
intentionally to the work, is clear from this; it was He who saw the
blind man, not the blind man who came to Him; and so earnestly did He
look upon him, that even His disciples perceived it. From this, at
least, they came to question Him; for when they saw Him earnestly
regarding the man, they asked Him, saying, “Who did sin, this man, or
his parents?” A mistaken question, for how could he sin before he was
born? and how, if his parents had sinned, would he have been punished?
Whence then came they to put this question? Before, when He healed the
paralytic, He said, “Behold, thou art made whole, sin no more.” ( [John
5.14](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#014.md)<span id="iv.lviii-p4.4"></span>
.) They therefore, having understood that he was palsied on account of
sin, said, “Well, that other was palsied because of his sins; but
concerning this man, what wouldest Thou say? hath he sinned? It is not
possible to say so, for he is blind from his birth. Have his parents
sinned? Neither can one say this, for the child suffers not punishment
for the father.” As therefore when we see a child evil entreated, we
exclaim, “What can one say of this? what has the child done?” not as
asking a question, but as being perplexed, so the disciples spake here,
not so much asking for information, as being in perplexity. What then
saith Christ?

<span id="iv.lviii-p5"></span> [John
9.3](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#003.md)<span id="iv.lviii-p5.1"></span> .
“Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents.”

<span id="iv.lviii-p6"></span> This He saith not as acquitting them of
sins, for He saith not simply, “Neither hath this man sinned, nor his
parents,” but addeth, “that he should have been born blind  <span
id="fr_1504"></span>[1505](#fn_1504.md) —but that the Son of God should be
glorified in him.” “For both this man hath sinned and his parents, but
his blindness proceedeth not from that.” And this He said, not
signifying that though this man indeed was not in such case, yet that
others had been made blind from such a cause, the sins of their parents,
since it cannot be that when one sinneth another should be punished. For
if we allow this, we must also allow that he sinned before his birth. As
therefore when He declared, “neither hath this man sinned,” He said not
that it is possible to sin from one’s very birth, and be punished for
it; so when He said, “nor his parents,” He said not that one may be
punished for his parents’ sake. This supposition He re <span
id="page_199">p. 199</span> <span id="iv.lviii-Page_199"></span> moveth
by the mouth of Ezekiel; “As I live saith the Lord, this proverb shall
not be, that is used, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the
children’s teeth are set on edge.” ( [Ezek.
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#003.md),
[2](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#002)<span id="iv.lviii-p7.2"></span> ..md)
And Moses saith, “The father shall not die for the child, neither shall
the child die for the father.” ( [Deut. xxiv.
16](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#016) <span id="iv.lviii-p7.3"></span> ..md)
And of a certain king  <span id="fr_1505"></span>[1506](#fn_1505.md)
Scripture saith, that for this very reason he did not this thing,  <span
id="fr_1506"></span>[1507](#fn_1506.md) observing the law of Moses. But if
any one argue, “How then is it said, ‘Who visiteth the sins of the
parents upon the children unto the third and fourth generation’?” (
[Deut. v. 9](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#009.md) <span
id="iv.lviii-p9.2"></span> ); we should make this answer, that the
assertion is not universal, but that it is spoken with reference to
certain who came out of Egypt. And its meaning is of this kind; “Since
these who have come out of Egypt, after signs and wonders, have become
worse than their forefathers who saw none of these things, they shall
suffer,” It saith, “the same that those others suffered, since they have
dared the same crimes.” And that it was spoken of those men, any one who
will give attention to the passage will more certainly know. Wherefore
then was he born blind?

<span id="iv.lviii-p10"></span> “That the glory  <span
id="fr_1507"></span>[1508](#fn_1507.md) of God should be made manifest,”
 <span id="fr_1508"></span>[1509](#fn_1508.md) He saith.

<span id="iv.lviii-p13"></span>Lo, here again is another difficulty, if
without this man’s punishment, it was not possible that the glory of God
should be shown. Certainly it is not said that it was impossible, for it
was possible, but, “that it might be manifested even in this man.”
“What,” saith some one, “did he suffer wrong for the glory of God?” What
wrong, tell me? For what if God had never willed to produce him at all?
But I assert that he even received benefit from his blindness: since he
recovered the sight of the eyes within. What were the Jews profited by
their eyes? They incurred the heavier punishment, being blinded even
while they saw. And what injury had this man by his blindness? For by
means of it he recovered sight. As then the evils of the present life
are not evils, so neither are the good things good; sin alone is an
evil, but blindness is not an evil. And He who had brought this man from
not being into being, had also power to leave him as he was.

<span id="iv.lviii-p14"></span> \[2.\] But some say, that this
conjunction  <span id="fr_1509"></span>[1510](#fn_1509.md) is not at all
expressive of cause, but relates to the consequence of the miracle; as
when He saith, “For judgment I am come into this world, that they which
see not might see, and that they which see might be made blind” ( [John
9.39](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#039.md)<span id="iv.lviii-p15.4"></span>
); and yet it was not for this He came, that those who saw might be made
blind. And again Paul, “Because that which may be known of God is
manifested in them, that they may be without excuse” ( [Rom.
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#019.md),
[20](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#020.md)<span id="iv.lviii-p15.5"></span>
); yet He showed it not unto them for this, that they might be deprived
of excuse, but that they might obtain excuse. And again in another
place, “The Law entered, that the offense might abound” ( [Rom. v.
20](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#020.md) <span id="iv.lviii-p15.6"></span>
); yet it was not for this that it entered, but that sin might be
checked. Seest thou everywhere that the conjunction relates to the
consequence? For as some excellent architect may build part of a house,
and leave the rest unfinished, so that to those who believe not he may
prove, by means of that remnant, that he is author of the whole; so also
God joineth together and completeth our body, as it were a house
decayed, healing the withered hand, bracing the palsied limbs,
straightening the lame, cleansing the lepers, raising up the sick,
making sound the crippled, recalling the dead from death, opening the
eyes that were closed, or adding them where before they were not; all
which things, being blemishes  <span
id="fr_1510"></span>[1511](#fn_1510.md) arising from the infirmity of our
nature, He by correcting showed His power.

<span id="iv.lviii-p17"></span> But when He said, “That the glory of God
might be manifested,” He spake of Himself, not of the Father; His  <span
id="fr_1511"></span>[1512](#fn_1511.md) glory was already manifest. For
since they had heard that God made man, taking the dust of the earth, so
also Christ made clay. To have said, “I am He who took the dust of the
earth, and made man,” would have seemed a hard thing to His hearers; but
this when shown by actual working, no longer stood in their way. So that
He by taking earth, and mixing it with spittle, showed forth His hidden
glory; for no small glory was it that He should be deemed the Architect
of the creation.

<span id="iv.lviii-p19"></span>And after this the rest also followed;
from the part, the whole was proved, since the belief of the greater
also confirmed the less. For man is more honorable than any created
thing, and of our members the most honorable is the eye. This is the
cause that He fashioned the eyes, not in a common manner, but in the way
that He did. For though that member be small in size, yet it is more
necessary than any part of the body. And this Paul showed when he said,
“If the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body;
is it therefore not of the body?” ( [1 Cor. xii.
16](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#016.md) <span id="iv.lviii-p19.1"></span>
.) For all indeed that is in us is a manifestation of the wisdom of God,
but much more the eye; this it is that guides the whole body, this gives
beauty to it all, this adorns the countenance, this is the light of all
the limbs. What the sun is in the world, that the eye is in the body;
quench the sun, and you destroy and confound all things; quench the
<span id="page_200">p. 200</span> <span id="iv.lviii-Page_200"></span>
eyes, and the feet, the hands, the soul, are useless. When these are
disabled, even knowledge is gone, since by means of these we know God.
“For the invisible things of Him from the creation of the world are
clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made.” ( [Rom. i.
20](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#020.md) <span id="iv.lviii-p19.2"></span>
.) Wherefore the eye is not only a light to the body, but beyond the
body to the soul also. On which account it is established as in a royal
fortress, obtaining the higher condition, and presiding over the other
senses. This then Christ forms.

<span id="iv.lviii-p20"></span>And that thou mayest not deem that He
needeth matter when He worketh, and that thou mayest learn that He had
not need at all of clay, (for He who brought into being the greater
existences when as yet they were not, would much more have made this
without matter,) that I say thou mayest learn that He did not this
through necessity, but to show that He was the Creator at the beginning,
when He had spread on the clay He saith, “Go, wash,” “that thou mayest
know that I need not clay to create eyes, but that My glory may be
manifested hereby.” For to show that He spake of Himself when He said,
“That the glory of God may be manifested,” He added,

<span id="iv.lviii-p21"></span> [John
9.4](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#004.md)<span id="iv.lviii-p21.1"></span> .
“I must work the works of Him that sent Me.”

<span id="iv.lviii-p22"></span> That is, “I must manifest Myself, and do
the things which may show that I do the same things with the Father”;
not things “similar,” but, “the same,” an expression which marks greater
unvaryingness, and which is used of those who do not differ ever so
little. Who then after this will face Him, when he seeth that He hath
the same power with the Father? For not only did He form or open eyes,
but gave also the gift of sight, which is a proof that He also breathed
in the soul. Since if that did not work, the eye, though perfected,
could never see anything; so that He gave both the energy  <span
id="fr_1512"></span>[1513](#fn_1512.md) which is from the soul, and gave
the member also possessing all things, both arteries and nerves and
veins, and all things of which our body is composed.

<span id="iv.lviii-p24"></span>“I must work while it is day.”

<span id="iv.lviii-p25"></span>What mean these words? To what conclusion
do they lead? To an important one. For what He saith is of this kind.
“While it is day, while men may believe on Me, while this life lasteth,
I must work.”

<span id="iv.lviii-p26"></span>“The night cometh,” that is, futurity,
“when no man can work.”

<span id="iv.lviii-p27"></span>He said not, “when I cannot work,” but,
“when no man can work”: that is, when there is no longer faith, nor
labors, nor repentance. For to show that He calleth faith, a “work,”
when they say unto Him, “What shall we do, that we might work the works
of God?” ( [John 6.28](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#028.md)<span
id="iv.lviii-p27.1"></span> ), He replieth, “This is the work of God,
that ye believe on Him whom He hath sent.” How then can no man work this
work in the future world?  <span id="fr_1513"></span>[1514](#fn_1513.md)
Because there faith is not, but all, willingly, or unwillingly, will
submit. For lest any one should say that He acted as He did from desire
of honor, He showeth that He did all to spare them who had power to
believe “here” only, but who could no longer “there” gain any good
thing. On this account, though the blind man came not to Him, He did
what He did: for that the man was worthy to be healed, that had he seen
he would have believed and come to Christ, that had he heard from any
that He was present, he would not even so have been neglectful, is clear
from what follows, from his courage, from his very faith. For it was
likely that he would have considered with himself, and have said, “What
is this? He made clay, and anointed my eyes, and said to me, ‘Go, wash;’
could he not have healed me, and then have sent me to Siloam? Often have
I washed there with many others, and have gained no good; had he
possessed any power, he would while present have healed me.” Just as
Naaman spake respecting Elisha; for he too being commanded to go wash in
Jordan, believed not, and this too when there was such a fame abroad
concerning Elisha. ( [2 Kings v. 11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#011.md)
<span id="iv.lviii-p28.2"></span> .) But the blind man neither
disbelieved, nor contradicted, nor reasoned with himself, “What is this?
Ought he to have put on clay? This is rather to blind one the more: who
ever recovered sight so?” But he used no such reasonings. Seest thou his
steadfast faith and zeal?

<span id="iv.lviii-p29"></span>“The night cometh.” Next He showeth, that
even after the Crucifixion He would care for the ungodly, and bring many
to Himself. For “it is yet day.” But after that, He entirely cutteth
them off, and declaring this, He saith,

<span id="iv.lviii-p30"></span> [John
9.5](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#005.md)<span id="iv.lviii-p30.1"></span> .
“As long as I am in the world, I am the Light of the world.”

<span id="iv.lviii-p31"></span> \[3.\] As also He said to others,
“Believe while the light is with you.”  <span
id="fr_1514"></span>[1515](#fn_1514.md) ( [John
12.36](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#036.md)<span id="iv.lviii-p32.2"></span>
.) Wherefore then did Paul call this life “night” and that other “day”?
Not opposing Christ, but saying the same thing, if not in words yet in
sense; for he also saith, “The night is far spent, the day is at hand.”
( [Rom. xiii. 12](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#012.md) <span
id="iv.lviii-p32.3"></span> .) The present time he calleth “night,”
because of those who sit in darkness, or because he compareth it with
that day which is to come, Christ calleth the future “night,” because
there sin has no power to work;  <span
id="fr_1515"></span>[1516](#fn_1515.md) but Paul calleth the present life
night, because they are in darkness who continue in <span
id="page_201">p. 201</span> <span id="iv.lviii-Page_201"></span>
wickedness and unbelief. Addressing himself then to the faithful he
said, “The night is far spent, the day is at hand,” since they should
enjoy that light; and he calleth the old life night. “Let us put away,”
he saith, “the works of darkness.” Seest thou that he telleth them that
it is “night”? wherefore he saith, “Let us walk honestly as in the day,”
that we may enjoy that light. For if this light be so good, consider
what that will be; as much as the sunlight is brighter than the flame of
a candle, so much and far more is that light better than this. And
signifying this, Christ saith, that “the sun shall be darkened.” Because
of the excess of that brightness, not even the sun shall be seen.

<span id="iv.lviii-p34"></span> If now in order to have here
well-lighted and airy houses, we expend immense sums, building and
toiling, consider how we ought to spend our very bodies themselves, that
glorious houses may be built for us in the heavens where is that Light
ineffable. Here there are strifes and contentions about boundaries and
walls, but there will be nothing of the kind there, no envy, no malice,
no one will dispute with us about settling boundaries. This dwelling too
we assuredly needs must leave, but that abideth with us forever; this
must decay by time, and be exposed to innumerable injuries, but that
must remain without growing old perpetually; this a poor man cannot
build, but that other one may build with two mites, as did the widow.
Wherefore I choke with grief, that when so many blessings are laid
before us, we are slothful, and despise them; we use every exertion to
have splendid houses here, but how to gain in heaven so much as a little
resting-place, we care not, we think not. For tell me, where wouldest
thou have thy dwelling here? In the wilderness, or in one of the smaller
cities? I think not; but in some of the most royal and grand cities,
where the traffic is more, where the splendor is greater. But I will
lead thee into such a City, whose Builder and Maker is God; there I
exhort thee to found and build, at less cost \[with less labor  <span
id="fr_1516"></span>[1517](#fn_1516.md) \]. That house the hands of the
poor build, and it is most truly “building,” just as the structures made
here are the work of extreme folly. For if a man were to bring you into
the land of Persia, to behold what is there and to return, and were then
to bid you build houses there, would you not condemn him for excessive
folly, as bidding you spend unseasonably? How then dost thou this very
same thing upon the earth which thou shalt shortly leave? “But I shall
leave it to my children,” saith some one. Yet they too shall leave it
soon after thee; nay, often even before thee; and their successors the
same. And even here it is a subject of melancholy to thee that thou
seest not thine heirs retain their possessions, but there thou needest
apprehend nothing of the sort; the possession remaineth immovable, to
thee, to thy children, and to their descendants, if they imitate the
same goodness. That building Christ taketh in hand, he who buildeth that
needs not to appoint care-takers, nor be thoughtful, nor anxious; for
when God hath undertaken the work, what need of thought? He bringeth all
things together, and raiseth the house. Nor is this the only thing
wonderful, but also that He so buildeth it as is pleasing to thee, or
rather even beyond what is pleasing, beyond what thou desirest; for He
is the most excellent Artist, and careth greatly for thy advantage. If
thou art poor, and desirest to build this house, it brings thee no envy,
produces against thee no malice, for none of those who know how to envy
behold it, but the Angels who know how to rejoice at thy blessings; none
will be able to encroach upon it, for none dwell near it of those who
are diseased with such passions. For neighbors thou hast there the
saints, Peter and Paul with their company, all the Prophets, the
Martyrs, the multitude  <span id="fr_1517"></span>[1518](#fn_1517.md) of
Angels, of Archangels. For the sake then of all these things,  <span
id="fr_1518"></span>[1519](#fn_1518.md) let us empty our substance upon the
poor, that we may obtain those tabernacles;  <span
id="fr_1519"></span>[1520](#fn_1519.md) which may we all obtain through the
grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom and with whom
to the Father and the Holy Ghost be glory, now and ever and world
without end. Amen.
