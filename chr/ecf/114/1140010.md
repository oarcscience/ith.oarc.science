<span id="iv.vii-p2"></span> <span id="iv.vii-p2.1"></span> <span
class="c1"><span id="iv.vii-p2.2"></span>[John i.

<span id="iv.vii-p3"></span>“All things were made by Him; and without
Him was not anything made that was made.”

<span id="iv.vii-p4"></span> \[1.\] <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vii-p4.1"></span>Moses</span> in the beginning of the history and
writings of the Old Testament speaks to us of the objects of sense, and
enumerates them to us at length. For, “In the beginning,” he says, “God
made the heaven and the earth,” and then he adds, that light was
created, and a second heaven and the stars, the various kinds of living
creatures, and, that we may not delay by going through particulars,
everything else. But this Evangelist, cutting all short, includes both
these things and the things which are above these in a single sentence;
with reason, because they were known to his hearers, and because he is
hastening to a greater subject, and has instituted all his treatise,
that he might speak not of the works but of the Creator, and Him who
produced them all. And therefore Moses, though he has selected the
smaller portion of the creation, (for he has spoken nothing to us
concerning the invisible powers,) dwells on these things;  <span
id="fr_103"></span>[104](#fn_103.md) while John, as hastening to ascend to
the Creator Himself, runs by both these things, and those on which Moses
was silent, having comprised them in one little saying, “All things were
made by Him.” And that you may not think that he merely speaks of all
the things mentioned by Moses, he adds, that “without Him was not
anything made that was made.” That is to say, that of created things,
not one, whether it be visible  <span id="fr_104"></span>[105](#fn_104.md)
or intelligible  <span id="fr_105"></span>[106](#fn_105.md) was brought
into being without the power of the Son.

<span id="iv.vii-p8"></span>For we will not put the full stop after “not
anything,” as the heretics do. They, because they wish to make the
Spirit created, say, “What was made, in Him was Life”; yet so what is
said becomes unintelligible. First, it was not the time here to make
mention of the Spirit, and if he desired to do so, why did he state it
so indistinctly? For how is it clear that this saying relates to the
Spirit? Besides, we shall find by this argument, not that the Spirit,
but that the Son Himself, is created by Himself. But rouse yourselves,
that what is said may not escape you; and come, let us read for a while
after their fashion, for so its absurdity will be clearer to us. “What
was made, in Him was Life.” They say that the Spirit is called “Life.”
But this “Life” is found to be also “Light,” for he adds, “And the Life
was the Light of men.” ( [John
1.4](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#004)<span id="iv.vii-p8.1"></span> ..md)
Therefore, according to them the “Light of men” here means the Spirit.
Well, but when he goes on to say, that “There was a man sent from God,
to bear witness of that Light” ( [John
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#006.md),
[7](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#007)<span id="iv.vii-p8.2"></span> .md),
they needs must assert, that this too is spoken of the Spirit; for whom
he above called “Word,” Him as he proceeds he calls “God,” and “Life,”
and “Light.” This “Word” he says was “Life,” and this “Life” was
“Light.” If now this Word was Life, and if this Word and this Life
became flesh, then the Life, that is to say, the Word, “was made flesh,
and we beheld” Its “glory, the glory as of the Only-Begotten of the
Father.” If then they say that the Spirit is here called “Life,”
consider what strange consequences will follow. It will be the Spirit,
not the Son, that was made flesh; the Spirit will be the Only-Begotten
Son.

<span id="iv.vii-p9"></span>And those who read the passage so will fall,
if not into this, yet in avoiding this into another most strange
conclusion. If they allow that the words are spoken of the Son, and yet
do not stop or read as we do, then they will assert that the Son is
created by Himself. Since, if “the Word was Life,” and “what was made in
Him was Life”; according to this reading He is created in Himself and
through Himself. Then after some words between, he has added, “And we
beheld His glory, the glory as of the Only-Begotten of the Father.” (
[John 1.14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014.md)<span
id="iv.vii-p9.1"></span> .) See, the Holy Spirit is found, according to
the reading of those who assert these things, to be also an
only-begotten Son, for it is concerning Him that all this declaration is
uttered by him. See when the word has swerved  <span
id="fr_106"></span>[107](#fn_106.md) from the truth, whither it is
perverted, and what strange consequences it produces!

<span id="iv.vii-p11"></span>What then, says one, is not the Spirit
“Light”? It is Light: but in this place there is no mention of the
Spirit. Since even God (the Father) is called “Spirit,” that is to say,
incorporeal, yet God (the Father) is not absolutely meant wherever
“Spirit” is mentioned. And why do you wonder if we say this of the
Father? We could not even say of the Comforter, that wherever “Spirit”
(is mentioned), the Comforter is absolutely meant, and yet this is His
most distinctive name; still not always where Spirit (is mentioned is)
the Comforter (meant). Thus Christ is called “the power of God” ( [1
Cor. i. 24](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#024.md) <span
id="iv.vii-p11.1"></span> ), <span id="page_22">p. 22</span> <span
id="iv.vii-Page_22"></span> and “the wisdom of God”; yet not always
where “the power” and “the wisdom of God” are mentioned is Christ meant;
so in this passage, although the Spirit does give “Light,” yet the
Evangelist is not now speaking of the Spirit.

<span id="iv.vii-p12"></span> When we have shut them out from these
strange opinions, they who take all manner of pains to withstand the
truth, say, (still clinging to the same reading,) “Whatever came into
existence  <span id="fr_107"></span>[108](#fn_107.md) by him was life,
because,” says one, “whatever came into existence was life.” What then
do you say of the punishment of the men of Sodom, and the flood, and
hell fire, and ten thousand like things? “But,” says one, “we are
speaking of the material creation.”  <span
id="fr_108"></span>[109](#fn_108.md) Well, these too belong entirely to the
material creation. But that we may out of our abundance  <span
id="fr_109"></span>[110](#fn_109.md) refute their argument, we will ask
them, “Is wood, life,” tell me? “Is stone, life?” these things that are
lifeless and motionless? Nay, is man absolutely life? Who would say so?
he is not pure life,  <span id="fr_110"></span>[111](#fn_110.md) but is
capable of receiving life.

<span id="iv.vii-p17"></span>\[2.\] See here again, an absurdity; by the
same succession of consequences we will bring the argument to such a
point, that even hence you may learn their folly. In this way they
assert things by no means befitting of the Spirit. Being driven from
their other ground, they apply those things to men, which they before
thought to be spoken worthily of the Spirit. However, let us examine the
reading itself this way also. The creature is now called “life,”
therefore, the same is “light,” and John came to witness concerning it.
Why then is not he also “light”? He says that “he was not that light” (
[John 1.8](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#008.md)<span
id="iv.vii-p17.1"></span> ), and yet he belonged to created things? How
then is he not “light”? How was he “in the world, and the world was made
by him”? ( [John 1.10](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#010.md)<span
id="iv.vii-p17.2"></span> .) Was the creature in the creature, and was
the creature made by the creature? But how did “the world know him not”?
How did the creature not know the creature? “But as many as received
him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God.” ( [John
1.12](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#012)<span id="iv.vii-p17.3"></span> ..md)
But enough of laughter. For the rest I leave it to you to attack these
monstrous reasonings, that we may not seem to have chosen  <span
id="fr_111"></span>[112](#fn_111.md) to raise a laugh for its own sake, and
waste the time without cause. For if these things are neither said of
the Spirit, (and it has been shown that they are not,) nor of anything
created, and yet they still hold to the same reading, that stranger
conclusion than any which we before mentioned, will follow, that the Son
was made by Himself. For if the Son is the true Light, and this Light
was Life, and this Life was made in Him, this must needs be the result
according to their own reading. Let us then relinquish this reading, and
come to the recognized reading and explanation.  <span
id="fr_112"></span>[113](#fn_112.md)

<span id="iv.vii-p20"></span> And what is that? It is to make the
sentence end at “was made,” and to begin the next sentence with, “In Him
was Life.” What (the Evangelist) says is this, “Without Him was not
anything made that was made”; whatever created thing was made, says he,
was not made without Him. See you how by this short addition he has
rectified all the besetting  <span id="fr_113"></span>[114](#fn_113.md)
difficulties; for the saying, that “without Him was not anything made,”
and then the adding, “which was made,” includes things cognizable by the
intellect,  <span id="fr_114"></span>[115](#fn_114.md) but excludes the
Spirit. For after he had said that “all things were made by Him,” and
“without Him was not anything made,” he needed this addition, lest some
one should say, “If all things were made by Him, then the Spirit also
was made.” “I,” he replies, “asserted that whatever was made was made by
Him, even though it be invisible, or incorporeal, or in the heavens. For
this reason, I did not say absolutely, ‘all things,’ but ‘whatever was
made,’ that is, ‘created things,’ but the Spirit is uncreated.”

<span id="iv.vii-p23"></span>Do you see the precision of his teaching?
He has alluded to the creation of material things, (for concerning these
Moses had taught before him,) and after bringing us to advance from
thence to higher things, I mean the immaterial and the invisible, he
excepts the Holy Spirit from all creation. And so Paul, inspired by the
same grace, said, “For by Him were all things created.” ( [Col. i.
16](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#016) <span id="iv.vii-p23.1"></span> ..md)
Observe too here again the same exactness.  For the same Spirit moved
this soul also. That no one should except any created things from the
works of God because of their being invisible, nor yet should confound
the Comforter with them, after running through the objects of sense
which are known to all, he enumerates also things in the heavens,
saying, “Whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or
powers”; for the expression “whether” subjoined to each, shows to us
nothing else but this, that “by Him all things were made, and without
Him was not anything made that was made.”

<span id="iv.vii-p24"></span> But if you think that the expression “by”
 <span id="fr_115"></span>[116](#fn_115.md) is a mark of inferiority, (as
making Christ an instrument,) hear him say, “Thou, Lord, in the
beginning, hast laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are
the work of Thy hands.” ( [Ps. cii. 25](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#025.md)
<span id="iv.vii-p25.2"></span> .) He says of the Son what is said of
the Father in His character of Creator; which he would not have said,
unless he had deemed of Him as of a Creator, and yet not subservient
<span id="page_23">p. 23</span> <span id="iv.vii-Page_23"></span> to
any. And if the expression “by Him” is here used, it is put for no other
reason but to prevent any one from supposing the Son to be Unbegotten.
For that in respect of the title of Creator He is nothing inferior to
the Father; hear from Himself, where He saith, “As the Father raiseth up
the dead and quickeneth them, even so the Son quickeneth whom He will.”
( [John 5.21](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#021.md)<span
id="iv.vii-p25.3"></span> .) If now in the Old Testament it is said of
the Son, “Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the
earth,” His title of Creator is plain. But if you say that the Prophet
spoke this of the Father, and that Paul attributed to the Son what was
said of the Father, even so the conclusion is the same. For Paul would
not have decided that the same expression suited the Son, unless he had
been very confident that between Father and Son there was an equality of
honor; since it would have been an act of extremest rashness to refer
what suited an incomparable Nature to a nature inferior to, and falling
short of it. But the Son is not inferior to, nor falls short of, the
Essence of the Father; and therefore Paul has not only dared to use
these expressions concerning Him, but also others like them. For the
expression “from Whom,” which you decide to belong properly to the
Father alone, he uses also concerning the Son, when he says, “from which
all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit
together, increaseth with the increase of God.” ( [Col. ii.
19](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#019) <span id="iv.vii-p25.4"></span> ..md)

<span id="iv.vii-p26"></span>\[3.\] And he is not content with this
only, he stops your mouths in another way also, by applying to the
Father the expression “by whom,” which you say is a mark of inferiority.
For he says, “God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the
fellowship of His Son” ( [1 Cor. i. 9](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#009.md)
<span id="iv.vii-p26.1"></span> ): and again, “By His will” ( [1 Cor. i.
1](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#001.md) <span id="iv.vii-p26.2"></span> ,
&c.); and in another place, “For of Him, and through Him, and to Him,
are all things.” ( [Rom. xi. 26](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#026.md) <span
id="iv.vii-p26.3"></span> .) Neither is the expression “from  <span
id="fr_116"></span>[117](#fn_116.md) whom,” assigned to the Son only, but
also to the Spirit; for the angel said to Joseph, “Fear not to take unto
thee Mary thy wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy
Ghost.” ( [Matt. i. 20](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#020.md) <span
id="iv.vii-p27.3"></span> .) As also the Prophet does not deem it
improper to apply to the Father the expression “in whom,”  <span
id="fr_117"></span>[118](#fn_117.md) which belongs to the Spirit, when he
says, “In  <span id="fr_118"></span>[119](#fn_118.md) God we shall do
valiantly.” ( [Ps. lx. 12](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#012.md) <span
id="iv.vii-p29.3"></span> .) And Paul, “Making request, if by any means
now at length I might have a prosperous journey, in the will of God, to
come unto you.” ( [Rom. i. 10](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#010.md) <span
id="iv.vii-p29.4"></span> .) And again he uses it of Christ, saying, “In
Christ Jesus.” ( [Rom. 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#011.md),
[23](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#023.md)<span id="iv.vii-p29.5"></span> ,
&c.) In short, we may often and continually find these expressions
interchanged;  <span id="fr_119"></span>[120](#fn_119.md) now this would
not have taken place, had not the same Essence been in every instance
their subject. And that you may not imagine that the words, “All things
were made by Him,” are in this case used concerning His miracles, (for
the other Evangelists have discoursed concerning these;) he farther goes
on to say, “He was in the world, and the world was made by Him”; (but
not the Spirit, for This is not of the number of created things, but of
those above all creation.)

<span id="iv.vii-p31"></span> Let us now attend to what follows. John
having spoken of the work of creation, that “All things were made by
Him, and without Him was not anything made that was made,” goes on to
speak concerning His Providence, where he saith, “In Him was Life.” That
no one may doubt how so many and so great things were “made by Him,” he
adds, that “In Him was Life.” For as with the fountain which is the
mother of the great deeps, however much you take away you nothing lessen
the fountain; so with the energy of the Only-Begotten, however much you
believe has been produced and made by it, it has become no whit the
less. Or, to use a more familiar example, I will instance that of light,
which the Apostle himself added immediately, saying, “And the Life was
the Light.” As then light, however many myriads it may enlighten,
suffers no diminution of its own brightness; so also God, before
commencing His work and after completing it, remains alike indefectible,
nothing diminished, nor wearied by the greatness of the creation. Nay,
if need were that ten thousand, or even an infinite number of such
worlds be created, He remains the same, sufficient for them all not
merely to produce, but also to control them after their creation. For
the word “Life” here refers not merely to the act of creation, but also
to the providence (engaged) about the permanence of the things created;
it also lays down beforehand the doctrine of the resurrection, and is
the beginning  <span id="fr_120"></span>[121](#fn_120.md) of these
marvelous good tidings.  <span id="fr_121"></span>[122](#fn_121.md) Since
when “life” has come to be with us, the power of death is dissolved; and
when “light” has shone upon us, there is no longer darkness, but life
ever abides within us, and death cannot overcome it. So that what is
asserted of the Father might be asserted absolutely of Him (Christ)
also, that “In Him we live and move and have our being.” ( [Col.
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#016.md),
[17](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#017)<span id="iv.vii-p33.2"></span> ..md)
As Paul has shown when he says, “By Him were all things created,” and
“by Him all things consist”; for which reason He has been called also
“Root”  <span id="fr_122"></span>[123](#fn_122.md) and “Foundation.”  <span
id="fr_123"></span>[124](#fn_123.md)

<span id="iv.vii-p36"></span>But when you hear that “In Him was Life,”
do not imagine Him a compound Being, since <span id="page_24">p.
24</span> <span id="iv.vii-Page_24"></span> farther on he says of the
Father also, “As the Father hath Life in Himself, so hath He given to
the Son also to have Life” ( [John v.
26](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#026) <span id="iv.vii-p36.1"></span> .md);
now as you would not on account of this expression say that the Father
is compounded, so neither can you say so of the Son. Thus in another
place he says, that “God is Light” ( [1 John i.
5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#005) <span id="iv.vii-p36.2"></span> .md),
and elsewhere (it is said), that He “dwelleth in light unapproachable” (
[1 Tim. vi. 16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#016.md) <span
id="iv.vii-p36.3"></span> ); yet these expressions are used not that we
may suppose a compounded nature,  <span
id="fr_124"></span>[125](#fn_124.md) but that by little and little we may
be led up to the highest doctrines. For since one of the multitude could
not easily have understood how His life was Life Impersonate,  <span
id="fr_125"></span>[126](#fn_125.md) he first used that humbler expression,
and afterwards leads them (thus) trained to the higher doctrine. For He
who had said that “He hath given Him (the Son) to have life” ( [John
5.26](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#026)<span id="iv.vii-p38.3"></span> .md);
the Same saith in another place, “I am the Life” ( [John
14.6](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#006)<span id="iv.vii-p38.4"></span> .md);
and in another, “I am the Light.” ( [John
8.12](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#012)<span id="iv.vii-p38.5"></span> ..md)
And what, tell me, is the nature of this “light”? This kind (of light)
is the object not of the senses, but of the intellect, enlightening the
soul herself. And since Christ should hereafter say, that “None can come
unto Me except the Father draw him” ( [John
6.44](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#044)<span id="iv.vii-p38.6"></span> .md);
the Apostle has in this place anticipated an objection, and declared
that it is He (the Son) who “giveth light” ( [John
1.9](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#009)<span id="iv.vii-p38.7"></span> .md);
that although you hear a saying like this concerning the Father, you may
not say that it belongs to the Father only, but also to the Son. For,
“All things,” He saith, “which the Father hath are Mine.” ( [John
16.15](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#015.md)<span id="iv.vii-p38.8"></span>
.)

<span id="iv.vii-p39"></span>First then, the Evangelist hath instructed
us respecting the creation, after that he tells us of the goods relating
to the soul which He supplied to us by His coming; and these he has
darkly described in one sentence, when he says, “And the Life was the
Light of men.” ( [John 1.4](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#004.md)<span
id="iv.vii-p39.1"></span> .) He does not say, “was the light of the
Jews,” but universally “of men”: nor did the Jews only, but the Greeks
also, come to this knowledge, and this light was a common proffer made
 <span id="fr_126"></span>[127](#fn_126.md) to all. “Why did he not add
‘Angels,’ but said, ‘of men’?” Because at present his discourse is of
the nature of men, and to them he came bearing glad tidings of good
things.

<span id="iv.vii-p41"></span>“And the light shineth in darkness.” (
[John 1.5](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#005.md)<span
id="iv.vii-p41.1"></span> .) He calls death and error, “darkness.” For
the light which is the object of our senses does not shine in darkness,
but apart from it; but the preaching of Christ hath shone forth in the
midst of prevailing error, and made it to disappear. And He by enduring
death  <span id="fr_127"></span>[128](#fn_127.md) hath so overcome death,
that He hath recovered those already held by it. Since then neither
death overcame it, nor error, since it is bright everywhere, and shines
by its proper strength, therefore he says,

<span id="iv.vii-p43"></span>“And the darkness comprehended it not.” For
it cannot be overcome, and will not dwell in souls which wish not to be
enlightened.

<span id="iv.vii-p44"></span> \[4.\] But let it not trouble thee that It
took not all, for not by necessity and force, but by will and consent
 <span id="fr_128"></span>[129](#fn_128.md) does God bring us to Himself.
Therefore do not thou shut thy doors against this light, and thou shalt
enjoy great happiness.  <span id="fr_129"></span>[130](#fn_129.md) But this
light cometh by faith, and when it is come, it lighteth abundantly him
that hath received it; and if thou displayest a pure life (meet) for it,
remains indwelling within continually. “For,” He saith, “He that loveth
Me, will keep My commandments; and I and My Father will come unto him,
and make Our abode with him.” ( [John xiv.
23](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#023.md) <span id="iv.vii-p46.2"></span> ;
slightly varied.) As then one cannot rightly enjoy the sunlight, unless
he opens his eyes; so neither can one largely share this splendor,
unless he have expanded the eye of the soul, and rendered it in every
way keen of sight.

<span id="iv.vii-p47"></span>But how is this effected? Then when we have
cleansed the soul from all the passions. For sin is darkness, and a deep
darkness; as is clear, because men do it unconsciously and secretly.
For, “every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the
light.” ( [John 3.20](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#020.md)<span
id="iv.vii-p47.1"></span> .) And, “It is a shame even to speak of those
things which are done of them in secret.” ( [Eph. v.
12](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#012) <span id="iv.vii-p47.2"></span> ..md)
For, as in darkness a man knows neither friend nor foe, but cannot
perceive any of the properties of objects; so too is it in sin. For he
who desires to get more gain, makes no difference between friend and
enemy; and the envious regards with hostile eyes the man with whom he is
very intimate; and the plotter is at mortal quarrel with all alike. In
short, as to distinguishing the nature of objects, he who commits sin is
no better than men who are drunk or mad. And as in the night, wood,
lead, iron, silver, gold, precious stones, seem to us all alike on
account of the absence of the light which shows their distinctions; so
he who leads an impure life knows neither the excellence of temperance
nor the beauty of philosophy. For in darkness, as I said before, even
precious stones if they be displayed do not show their luster, not by
reason of their own nature, but because of the want of discernment in
the beholders. Nor is this the only evil which happens to us who are in
sin, but this also, that we live in constant fear: and as men walking in
a moonless night tremble, though none be by to frighten them; so those
who work iniquity cannot have confidence, though there be none to accuse
them; but they are afraid of everything, <span id="page_25">p. 25</span>
<span id="iv.vii-Page_25"></span> and are suspicious, being pricked by
their conscience: all to them is full of fear and distress,  <span
id="fr_130"></span>[131](#fn_130.md) they look about them at everything,
are terrified at everything. Let us then flee a life so painful,
especially since after this painfulness shall follow death; a deathless
death, for of the punishment in that place there will be no end; and in
this life they (who sin) are no better than madmen, in that they are
dreaming of things that have no existence. They think they are rich when
they are not rich, that they enjoy when they are not enjoying, nor do
they properly perceive the cheat until they are freed from the madness
and have shaken off the sleep. Wherefore Paul exhorts all to be sober,
and to watch; and Christ also commands the same. For he who is sober and
awake, although he be captured by sin, quickly beats it off; while he
who sleeps and is beside himself, perceives not how he is held prisoner
of it.

<span id="iv.vii-p49"></span> Let us then not sleep. This is not the
season of night, but of day. Let us therefore “walk honestly  <span
id="fr_131"></span>[132](#fn_131.md) as in the day” ( [Rom. xiii.
13](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#013) <span id="iv.vii-p50.2"></span> .md);
and nothing is more indecent than sin . In point of indecency it is not
so bad to go about naked as in sin and wrong doing. That is not so great
matter of blame, since it might even be caused by poverty; but nothing
has more shame and less honor than the sinner. Let us think of those who
come to the justice-hall on some account of extortion, or overreaching;
 <span id="fr_132"></span>[133](#fn_132.md) how base and ridiculous they
appear to all by their utter shamelessness, their lies, and audacity.
 <span id="fr_133"></span>[134](#fn_133.md) But we are such pitiable and
wretched beings, that we cannot bear ourselves to put on a garment
awkwardly or awry; nay, if we see another person in this state, we set
him right; and yet though we and all our neighbors are walking on our
heads, we do not even perceive it. For what, say, can be more shameful
than a man who goes in to a harlot? what more contemptible than an
insolent, a foul-tongued or an envious man? Whence then is it that these
things do not seem so disgraceful as to walk naked? Merely from habit.
To go naked no one has ever willingly endured; but all men are
continually venturing on the others without any fear. Yet if one came
into an assembly of angels, among whom nothing of the sort has ever
taken place, there he would clearly see the great ridicule (of such
conduct). And why do I say an assembly of angels? Even in the very
palaces among us, should one introduce a harlot and enjoy her, or be
oppressed by excess of wine, or commit any other like indecency, he
would suffer extreme punishment. But if it be intolerable that men
should dare such things in palaces, much more when the King is
everywhere present, and observes what is done, shall we if we dare them
undergo severest chastisement. Wherefore let us, I exhort you, show
forth in our life much gentleness, much purity, for we have a King who
beholds all our actions continually. In order then that this light may
ever richly enlighten us, let us gladly accept  <span
id="fr_134"></span>[135](#fn_134.md) these bright beams,  <span
id="fr_135"></span>[136](#fn_135.md) for so shall we enjoy both the good
things present and those to come, through the grace and lovingkindness
of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom, and with whom, to the Father, and the
Holy Spirit, be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
