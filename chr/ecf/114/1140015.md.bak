<span id="iv.xii-p3"></span>“He came unto His own, and His own received
Him not.”

<span id="iv.xii-p4"></span> \[1.\] <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.xii-p4.1"></span>Beloved</span> , God being loving towards man
and beneficent, does and contrives all things in order that we may shine
in virtue, and as desiring that we be well approved by Him. And to this
end He draws no one by force or compulsion: but by persuasion and
benefits He draws all that will, and wins them to Himself. Wherefore
when He came, some received Him, and others received Him not. For He
will have no unwilling, no forced domestic, but all of their own will
and choice, and grateful to Him for their service. Men, as needing the
ministry of servants, keep many in that state even against their will,
by the law of ownership;  <span id="fr_220"></span>[221](#fn_220.md) but
God, being without wants, and not standing in need of anything of ours,
but doing all only for our salvation makes us absolute  <span
id="fr_221"></span>[222](#fn_221.md) in this matter, and therefore lays
neither force nor compulsion on any of those who are unwilling. For He
looks only to our advantage: and to be drawn unwilling to a service like
this is the same as not serving at all.

<span id="iv.xii-p7"></span> “Why then,” says one, “does He punish those
who will not listen  <span id="fr_222"></span>[223](#fn_222.md) to Him, and
why hath He threatened hell to those who endure  <span
id="fr_223"></span>[224](#fn_223.md) not His commands?” Because, being Good
exceedingly, He cares even for those who obey Him not, and withdraws not
from them who start back and flee from Him. But when we  <span
id="fr_224"></span>[225](#fn_224.md) had rejected the first way of His
beneficence, and had refused to come by the path of persuasion and kind
treatment, then He brought in upon us the other way, that of correction
and punishments; most bitter indeed, but still necessary, when the
former is disregarded.  <span id="fr_225"></span>[226](#fn_225.md) Now
lawgivers also appoint many and grievous penalties against offenders,
and yet we feel no aversion to them for this; we even honor them the
more on account of the punishments they have enacted, and because though
not needing a single thing that we have, and often not knowing who they
should be that should enjoy the help afforded by their written laws,
 <span id="fr_226"></span>[227](#fn_226.md) they still took care for the
good ordering of our lives, rewarding those who live virtuously, and
checking by punishments the intemperate, and those  <span
id="fr_227"></span>[228](#fn_227.md) who would mar the repose  <span
id="fr_228"></span>[229](#fn_228.md) of others. And if we admire and love
these men, ought we not much more to marvel at and love God on account
of His so great care? For the difference between their and His
forethought regarding us is infinite. Unspeakable of a truth are the
riches of the goodness of God, and passing all excess.  <span
id="fr_229"></span>[230](#fn_229.md) Consider; “He came to His own,” not
for His personal need, (for, as I said, the Divinity is without wants,)
but to do good unto His own people. Yet not even so did His own receive
Him, when He came to His own for their advantage, but repelled Him, and
not this only, but they even cast Him out of the vineyard, and slew Him.
Yet not for this even did He shut them out from repentance, but granted
them, if they had been willing, after such wickedness as this, to wash
off all their transgressions by faith in Him, and to be made equal to
those who had done no such thing, but are His especial friends. And that
I say not this at random, or for persuasion’s sake, all the history of
the blessed Paul loudly declares. For when he, who after the Cross
persecuted Christ, and had stoned His martyr Stephen by those many
hands, repented, and condemned his former sins, and ran to Him whom he
had persecuted, He immediately enrolled him among His friends, and the
chiefest of them, having appointed him a herald and teacher of all the
world, who had been “a blasphemer, and persecutor, and injurious.” ( [1
Tim. i. 13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#013.md) <span
id="iv.xii-p15.1"></span> .) Even as he rejoicing at the lovingkindness
of God, has proclaimed aloud, and has not been ashamed, but having
recorded in his writings, as on a pillar, the deeds formerly dared by
him, has exhibited them to all; thinking it better that his former life
should be placarded  <span id="fr_230"></span>[231](#fn_230.md) in sight of
all, so that the greatness of the free gift of God might appear, than
that he should obscure His ineffable and indescribable lovingkindness by
hesitating to parade  <span id="fr_231"></span>[232](#fn_231.md) before all
men his own error. Wherefore continually  <span
id="fr_232"></span>[233](#fn_232.md) he treats of his persecution, his
plottings, his wars against the Church, at one time saying, “I am not
meet to be called an Apostle, because I persecuted the Church of God” (
[1 Cor. xv. 9](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#009.md) <span
id="iv.xii-p18.3"></span> ); at another, “Jesus came into the world to
save sinners, of whom I am chief.” ( [1 Tim. i.
15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#015) <span id="iv.xii-p18.4"></span> ..md)
And again, “Ye have heard of my conversation in time <span
id="page_36">p. 36</span> <span id="iv.xii-Page_36"></span> past in the
Jews’ religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God,
and wasted it.” ( [Gal. i. 13](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#013.md) <span
id="iv.xii-p18.5"></span> .)

<span id="iv.xii-p19"></span>\[2.\] For making as it were a kind of
return to Christ for His longsuffering towards him, by showing who it
was, what a hater and enemy that He saved, he declared with much
openness the warfare which at the first with all zeal he warred against
Christ; and with this he holds forth good hopes to those who despaired
of their condition. For he says, that Christ accepted him, in order that
in him first He “might show forth all longsuffering” ( [1 Tim. i.
16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#016) <span id="iv.xii-p19.1"></span> .md),
and the abundant riches of His goodness, “for a pattern to them that
should hereafter believe in Him to life everlasting.” Because the things
which they had dared were too great for any pardon which the Evangelist
declaring, said,

<span id="iv.xii-p20"></span> “He came to His own, and His own received
Him not.” Whence came He, who filleth all things, and who is everywhere
present? What place did He empty of His presence, who holdeth and
graspeth all things in His hand? He exchanged not one place for another;
how should He? But by His coming down to us He effected this. For since,
though being in the world, He did not seem to be there, because He was
not yet known, but afterwards manifested Himself by deigning to take
upon Him our flesh, he (St. John) calls this manifestation and descent
“a coming.”  <span id="fr_233"></span>[234](#fn_233.md) One might wonder at
 <span id="fr_234"></span>[235](#fn_234.md) the disciple who is not ashamed
of the dishonor of his Teacher, but even records the insolence which was
used towards Him: yet this is no small proof of his truth-loving
disposition. And besides, he who feels shame should feel it for those
who have offered an insult, not for the person outraged.  <span
id="fr_235"></span>[236](#fn_235.md) Indeed He by this very thing shone the
brighter, as taking, even after the insult, so much care for those who
had offered it; while they appeared ungrateful and accursed in the eyes
of all men, for having rejected Him who came to bring them so great
goods, as hateful to them, and an enemy. And not only in this were they
hurt, but also in not obtaining what they obtained who received Him.
What did these obtain?

<span id="iv.xii-p24"></span> [John
1.12](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#012.md)<span id="iv.xii-p24.1"></span> .
“As many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of
God,” says the Evangelist. “Why then, O blessed one, dost thou not also
tell us the punishment of them who received Him not? Thou hast said that
they were ‘His own,’ and that when ‘He came to His own, they received
Him not’; but what they shall suffer for this, what punishment they
shall undergo, thou hast not gone on to add. Yet so thou wouldest the
more have terrified them, and have softened the hardness of their
insanity by threatening. Wherefore then hast thou been silent?” “And
what other punishment,” he would say, “can be greater than this, that
when power is offered them to become sons of God, they do not become so,
but willingly deprive themselves of such nobility and honor as this?”
Although their punishment shall not even stop at this point, that they
gain no good, but moreover the unquenchable fire shall receive them, as
in going on he has more plainly revealed. But for the present he speaks
of the unutterable goods of those who received Him, and sets these words
in brief before us,  <span id="fr_236"></span>[237](#fn_236.md) saying, “As
many as received Him, to them gave He power to become sons of God.”
Whether bond or free, whether Greeks or barbarians or Scythians,
unlearned or learned, female or male, children or old men, in honor or
dishonor, rich or poor, rulers or private persons, all, He saith, are
deemed worthy the same privilege; for faith and the grace of the Spirit,
removing the inequality caused by worldly things, hath moulded all to
one fashion, and stamped them with one impress, the King’s. What can
equal this lovingkindness? A king, who is framed of the same clay with
us, does not deign to enrol among the royal host his fellow-servants,
who share the same nature with himself, and in character often are
better than he, if they chance to be slaves; but the Only-Begotten Son
of God did not disdain to reckon among the company of His children both
publicans, sorcerers, and slaves, nay, men of less repute and greater
poverty than these, maimed in body, and suffering from ten thousand
ills. Such is the power of faith in Him, such the excess of His grace.
And as the element of fire, when it meets with ore from the mine,
straightway of earth makes it gold, even so and much more Baptism makes
those who are washed to be of gold instead of clay; the Spirit at that
time falling like fire into our souls, burning up the “image of the
earthy” ( [1 Cor. xv. 49](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#049.md) <span
id="iv.xii-p25.1"></span> ), and producing “the image of the heavenly,”
fresh coined, bright and glittering, as from the furnace-mould.

<span id="iv.xii-p26"></span> Why then did he say not that “He made them
sons of God,” but that “He gave them power to become sons of God”? To
show that we need much zeal to keep the image of sonship impressed on us
at Baptism, all through without spot or soil  <span
id="fr_237"></span>[238](#fn_237.md) ; and at the same time to show that no
one shall be able to take this power from us, unless we are the first to
deprive ourselves of it. For if among men, those who have received the
absolute control of any matters have well-nigh as much power as those
who gave them the charge; much more shall we, who have obtained such
honor from God, be, if we do noth <span id="page_37">p. 37</span> <span
id="iv.xii-Page_37"></span> ing unworthy of this power, stronger than
all; because He who put this honor in our hands is greater and better
than all. At the same time too he wishes to show, that not even does
grace come upon man irrespectively,  <span
id="fr_238"></span>[239](#fn_238.md) but upon those who desire and take
pains for it. For it lies in the power of these to become (His) children
since if they do not themselves first make the choice, the gift does not
come upon them, nor have any effect.

<span id="iv.xii-p29"></span> \[3.\] Having therefore everywhere
excluded compulsion and pointing to (man’s) voluntary choice and free
power, he has said the same now. For even in these mystical blessings,
 <span id="fr_239"></span>[240](#fn_239.md) it is, on the one hand, God’s
part, to give the grace, on the other, man’s to supply faith; and in
after time there needs for what remains much earnestness. In order to
preserve our purity, it is not sufficient for us merely to have been
baptized and to have believed, but we must if we will continually enjoy
this brightness, display a life worthy of it. This then is God’s work in
us. To have been born the mystical Birth, and to have been cleansed from
all our former sins, comes from Baptism; but to remain for the future
pure, never again after this to admit any stain belongs to our own power
and diligence. And this is the reason why he reminds us of the manner of
the birth, and by comparison with fleshly pangs shows its excellence,
when he says,

<span id="iv.xii-p31"></span> [John
1.13](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#013.md)<span id="iv.xii-p31.1"></span> .
“Who were born, not of blood,  <span id="fr_240"></span>[241](#fn_240.md)
nor of the will of the flesh, but of God.” This he has done, in order
that, considering the vileness, and lowness of the first birth, which is
“of blood,” and “the will of the flesh,” and perceiving the highness and
nobleness of the second, which is by grace, we may form from thence some
great opinion of it, and one worthy of the gift of Him who hath begotten
us, and for the future exhibit much earnestness.

<span id="iv.xii-p33"></span> For there is no small fear, lest, having
sometime defiled that beautiful robe by our after sloth and
transgressions, we be cast out from the inner room  <span
id="fr_241"></span>[242](#fn_241.md) and bridal chamber, like the five
foolish virgins, or him who had not on a wedding garment. ( [Matt.
25:0](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#000.md), [Matt.
22:0](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#000)<span id="iv.xii-p34.2"></span> ..md)
He too was one of the guests, for he had been invited; but because,
after the invitation and so great an honor, he behaved with insolence
towards Him who had invited him, hear what punishment he suffers, how
pitiable, fit subject for many tears. For when he comes to partake of
that splendid table, not only is he forbidden the least, but bound hand
and foot alike, is carried into outer darkness, to undergo eternal and
endless wailing and gnashing of teeth. Therefore, beloved, let not us
either expect  <span id="fr_242"></span>[243](#fn_242.md) that faith is
sufficient to us for salvation; for if we do not show forth a pure life,
but come clothed with garments unworthy of this blessed calling, nothing
hinders us from suffering the same as that wretched one. It is strange
that He, who is God and King, is not ashamed of men who are vile,
beggars, and of no repute, but brings even them of the cross ways to
that table; while we manifest so much insensibility, as not even to be
made better by so great an honor, but even after the call remain in our
old wickedness, insolently abusing  <span
id="fr_243"></span>[244](#fn_243.md) the unspeakable lovingkindness of Him
who hath called us. For it was not for this that He called us to the
spiritual and awful communion of His mysteries, that we should enter
with our former wickedness; but that, putting off our filthiness, we
should change our raiment to such as becomes those who are entertained
in palaces. But if we will not act worthily of that calling this no
longer rests with Him who hath honored us, but with ourselves; it is not
He that casts us out from that admirable company of guests, but we cast
out ourselves.

<span id="iv.xii-p37"></span> He has done all His part. He has made the
marriage, He has provided the table, He has sent men to call us, has
received us when we came, and honored us with all other honor; but we,
when we have offered insult to Him, to the company, and to the wedding,
by our filthy garments, that is, our impure actions, are then with good
cause cast out. It is to honor the marriage and the guests, that He
drives off those bold  <span id="fr_244"></span>[245](#fn_244.md) and
shameless persons; for were He to suffer those clothed in such a
garment, He would seem to be offering insult to the rest. But may it
never be that one, either of us or of other, find this of Him who has
called us! For to this end have all these things been written before
they come to pass, that we, being sobered by the threats of the
Scriptures, may not suffer this disgrace and punishment to go on to the
deed, but stop it at the word only, and each with bright apparel come to
that call; which may it come to pass that we all enjoy, through the
grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom and with
whom, to the Father and the Holy Ghost, be glory for ever and ever.
Amen.
