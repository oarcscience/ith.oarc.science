<span id="iv.lxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c15"><span

<span id="iv.lxviii-p2"></span> <span id="iv.lxviii-p2.1"></span> <span
class="c1"><span id="iv.lxviii-p2.2"></span>[John xii.
8](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#008.md)<span

<span id="iv.lxviii-p3"></span>“Much people of the Jews therefore knew
that He was there, and they came, not for Jesus’ sake only, but that
they might see Lazarus also, whom He had raised from the dead.”

<span id="iv.lxviii-p4"></span> \[1.\] <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.lxviii-p4.1"></span>As</span> wealth is wont to hurl into
destruction  <span id="fr_1857"></span>[1858](#fn_1857.md) those who are
not heedful, so also is power; the first leads into covetousness, the
second into pride. See, for instance, how the subject multitude of the
Jews is sound, and their rulers corrupt; for that the first of these
believed Christ, the Evangelists continually assert, saying, that “many
of the multitude believed on Him” ( [John
7:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#031.md),
[48](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#048.md)<span id="iv.lxviii-p5.3"></span>
); but they who were of the rulers, believed not. And they themselves
say, not the multitude,  <span id="fr_1858"></span>[1859](#fn_1858.md)
“Hath any of the rulers believed on Him?” But what saith one? “The
multitude who know not God  <span id="fr_1859"></span>[1860](#fn_1859.md)
are accursed” ( [John 7.49](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#049.md)<span
id="iv.lxviii-p7.3"></span> ); the believers they call accursed, and
themselves the slayers, wise. In this place also, having beheld the
miracle, the many believed; but the rulers were not contented with their
own evil deeds,  <span id="fr_1860"></span>[1861](#fn_1860.md) they also
attempted to kill Lazarus.  <span id="fr_1861"></span>[1862](#fn_1861.md)
Suppose they did attempt to slay Christ because He broke the Sabbath,
because He made Himself equal to the Father, and because of the Romans
whom ye allege, yet what charge had they against Lazarus, that they
sought to kill him? Is the having received a benefit a crime? Seest thou
how murderous is their will? Yet He had worked many miracles; but none
exasperated them so much as this one, not the paralytic, not the blind.
For this was more wonderful in its nature, and was wrought after many
others, and it was a strange thing to see one, who had been dead four
days, walking and speaking. An honorable action, in truth, for the
feast, to mix up the solemn assembly with murders. Besides, in the one
case  <span id="fr_1862"></span>[1863](#fn_1862.md) they thought to charge
Him concerning the Sabbath, and so to draw away the multitudes; but
here, since they had no fault to find with Him, they make the attempt on
the man who had been healed. For here they could not even say that He
was opposed to the Father, since the prayer stopped their mouths. Since
then the charge which they continually brought against Him was removed,
and the miracle was evident, they hasten to murder. So that they would
have done the same in the case of the blind man, had it not been in
their power to find fault respecting the Sabbath. Besides, that man was
of no note, and they cast him out of the temple; but Lazarus was a
person of distinction, as is clear, since many came to comfort his
sisters; and the miracle was done in the sight of all, and most
marvelously. On <span id="page_243">p. 243</span> <span
id="iv.lxviii-Page_243"></span> which account all ran to see. This then
stung them, that while the feast was going on, all should leave it and
go to Bethany. They set their hand therefore to kill him, and thought
they were not  <span id="fr_1863"></span>[1864](#fn_1863.md) daring
anything, so murderous were they. On this account the  <span
id="fr_1864"></span>[1865](#fn_1864.md) Law at its commencement opens with
this, “Thou shalt not kill” ( [Ex. xx.
13](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#013.md) <span id="iv.lxviii-p12.2"></span>
); and the Prophet brings this charge against them, “Their hands are
full of blood.” ( [Isa. i. 15](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#015.md) <span
id="iv.lxviii-p12.3"></span> .)

<span id="iv.lxviii-p13"></span> But how, after not walking openly in
Jewry, and retiring into the wilderness, doth He again enter openly?
 <span id="fr_1865"></span>[1866](#fn_1865.md) Having quenched their anger
by retiring, He cometh to them when they were stilled. Moreover, the
multitude which went before and which followed after was sufficient to
cast them into an agony; for no sign so much attracted the people as
that of Lazarus. And another Evangelist saith, that they strewed their
garments under His feet  <span id="fr_1866"></span>[1867](#fn_1866.md) (
[Matt. xxi. 8](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#008.md) <span
id="iv.lxviii-p15.3"></span> ), and that “the whole city was moved” (
[Matt. xxi. 10](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#010.md) <span
id="iv.lxviii-p15.4"></span> ); with so great honor did He enter. And
this He did, figuring one prophecy and fulfilling another; and the same
act was the beginning of the one and the end of the other. For the,
“Rejoice, for thy King cometh unto thee meek” ( [Zech. ix.
9](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#009.md) <span id="iv.lxviii-p15.5"></span>
), belonged to Him as fulfilling a prophecy, but the sitting upon an ass
was the act of one prefiguring a future event, that He was about to have
the impure race of the Gentiles subject to Him.

<span id="iv.lxviii-p16"></span>But how say the others, that He sent
disciples, and said, “Loose the ass and the colt” ( [Matt. xxi.
2](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#002.md) <span id="iv.lxviii-p16.1"></span>
), while John saith nothing of the kind, but that “having found a young
ass, He sat upon it”? Because it is likely that both circumstances took
place, and that He after the ass was loosed, while the disciples were
bringing it, found (the colt), and sat upon it. And they took the small
branches of palm trees and olives, and strewed their garments in the
way, showing that they now had a higher opinion concerning Him than of a
Prophet, and said,

<span id="iv.lxviii-p17"></span> [John
12.13](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#013.md)<span
id="iv.lxviii-p17.1"></span> . “Hosannah, blessed is He that cometh in
the name of the Lord.”

<span id="iv.lxviii-p18"></span>Seest thou that this most choked them,
the persuasion which all men had that He was not an enemy of God? And
this most divided the people, His saying that He came from the Father.
But what meaneth,

<span id="iv.lxviii-p19"></span> [John
12.15](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#015.md)<span
id="iv.lxviii-p19.1"></span> . “Rejoice greatly,  <span
id="fr_1867"></span>[1868](#fn_1867.md) daughter of Zion”?

<span id="iv.lxviii-p21"></span>Because all their kings had for the most
part been an unjust and covetous kind of men, and had given them over to
their enemies, and had perverted the people, and made them subject to
their foes; “Be of good courage,” It saith, “this is not such an one,
but meek and gentle”; as is shown by the ass, for He entered not with an
army in His train, but having an ass alone.

<span id="iv.lxviii-p22"></span> [John
12.16](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#016.md)<span
id="iv.lxviii-p22.1"></span> . “But this,” saith the Evangelist, “the
disciples knew not, that it was written of Him.”  <span
id="fr_1868"></span>[1869](#fn_1868.md)

<span id="iv.lxviii-p24"></span>\[2.\] Seest thou that they were
ignorant on most points, because He did not reveal to them? For when He
said, “Destroy this Temple, and in three days I will raise it up” (
[John 2.19](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#019.md)<span
id="iv.lxviii-p24.1"></span> ), neither then did the disciples
understand.  <span id="fr_1869"></span>[1870](#fn_1869.md) And another
Evangelist saith, that “the saying was hid from them” ( [Luke xviii.
34](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#034.md) <span id="iv.lxviii-p25.3"></span>
), and they knew not that He should rise from the dead. Now this was
with reason concealed from them, (wherefore another Evangelist saith,
that as they heard it from time to time, they grieved and were dejected,
 <span id="fr_1870"></span>[1871](#fn_1870.md) and this because they
understood not the saying concerning the Resurrection,) it was with
reason concealed, as being too high for them: but why was not the matter
of the ass revealed to them? Because this was a great thing also. But
observe the wisdom of the Evangelist, how he is not ashamed to parade
their former ignorance. That it was written they knew, that it was
written of Him they knew not. For it would have offended them if He
being a King were about to suffer such things, and be so betrayed.
Besides, they could not at once have taken in the knowledge of the
Kingdom of which He spake; for another Evangelist saith, that they
thought the words were spoken of a kingdom of this world. ( [Matt. xx.
21](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#021.md) <span id="iv.lxviii-p26.3"></span>
.)

<span id="iv.lxviii-p27"></span> [John
12.17](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#017.md)<span
id="iv.lxviii-p27.1"></span> . “But the multitude bare witness that He
had raised Lazarus.”  <span id="fr_1871"></span>[1872](#fn_1871.md)

<span id="iv.lxviii-p29"></span>For so many would not have been suddenly
changed, unless they had believed in the miracle.

<span id="iv.lxviii-p30"></span> [John
12.19](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#019.md)<span
id="iv.lxviii-p30.1"></span> . “The Pharisees therefore said among
themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is
gone after Him.”

<span id="iv.lxviii-p31"></span> Now this seems to me to be said by
those who felt rightly, but had not courage to speak boldly, and who
then would restrain the others by pointing to the result, as though they
were attempting impossibilities. Here again they call the multitude “the
world.” For Scripture is wont to call by the name “world” both the
creation, and those who live in wickedness; the one, when It saith, “Who
bringeth out His world  <span id="fr_1872"></span>[1873](#fn_1872.md) by
number” ( [Isa. xl. 26](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#026.md) <span
id="iv.lxviii-p32.3"></span> ); the other when It saith, “The <span
id="page_244">p. 244</span> <span id="iv.lxviii-Page_244"></span> world
hateth not  <span id="fr_1873"></span>[1874](#fn_1873.md) you, but Me it
hateth.” ( [John 7.7](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#007.md)<span
id="iv.lxviii-p33.3"></span> .) And these things it is necessary to know
exactly, that we may not through the signification of words afford a
handle to the heretics.

<span id="iv.lxviii-p34"></span> [John
12.20](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#020.md)<span
id="iv.lxviii-p34.1"></span> . “And there were certain of the Greeks
that came up to worship at the Feast.”

<span id="iv.lxviii-p35"></span> Being now near to become proselytes,
they were at  <span id="fr_1874"></span>[1875](#fn_1874.md) the Feast. When
therefore the report concerning Him was imparted to them, they say,

<span id="iv.lxviii-p37"></span> [John
12.21](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#021.md)<span
id="iv.lxviii-p37.1"></span> . “We would see Jesus.”  <span
id="fr_1875"></span>[1876](#fn_1875.md)

<span id="iv.lxviii-p39"></span>Philip gives place to Andrew as being
before him, and communicates the matter to him. But neither doth he at
once act with authority; for he had heard that saying, “Go not into the
way of the Gentiles” ( [Matt. x. 5](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#005.md)
<span id="iv.lxviii-p39.1"></span> ): therefore having communicated with
the disciple, he refers the matter to his Master. For they both spoke to
Him. But what saith He?

<span id="iv.lxviii-p40"></span> [John
12:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#023.md),
[24](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#024.md)<span id="iv.lxviii-p40.1"></span>
. “The hour is come, that the Son of Man should be glorified. Verily,
verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and
die, it abideth alone.”

<span id="iv.lxviii-p41"></span> What is, “The hour is come”? He had
said, “Go not into the way of the Gentiles,” (thus cutting away all
excuse of ignorance from the Jews,) and had restrained the disciples.
When therefore the Jews continued disobedient, and the others desired to
come to Him, “Now,” saith He, “it is time to proceed to My Passion,
since all things are fulfilled. For if we were to continue to wait for
those who are disobedient and not admit these who even desire to come,
this would be unbefitting our tender care.” Since then He was about to
allow the disciples to go to the Gentiles after the Crucifixion, and
beheld them springing on before, He said, “It is time to proceed to the
Cross.” For He would not allow them to go sooner, that it might be for a
testimony unto them.  <span id="fr_1876"></span>[1877](#fn_1876.md) Until
that by their deeds the Jews rejected Him, until they crucified Him, He
said not, “Go and make disciples of all nations” ( [Matt. xxviii.
19](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#019.md) <span id="iv.lxviii-p42.2"></span>
), but, “Go not into the way of the Gentiles” ( [Matt. x.
5](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#005.md) <span id="iv.lxviii-p42.3"></span>
), and, “I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel” (
[Matt xv. 24](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#024.md) <span
id="iv.lxviii-p42.4"></span> ), and, “It is not meet to take the
children’s bread and give it unto dogs.” ( [Matt. xv.
26](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#026.md) <span id="iv.lxviii-p42.5"></span>
.) But when they hated Him, and so hated as to kill Him, it was
superfluous to persevere while they repulsed Him. For they refused Him,
saying, “We have no king but Cæsar.” ( [John
19.15](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#015.md)<span
id="iv.lxviii-p42.6"></span> .) So that at length He left them, when
they had left Him. Therefore He saith, “How often would I have gathered
your children together, and ye would not?” ( [Matt. xxiii.
37](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#037.md) <span id="iv.lxviii-p42.7"></span>
.)

<span id="iv.lxviii-p43"></span> What is, “Except a grain of corn fall
into the ground and die”? He speaketh of the Cross, for that they might
not be confounded at seeing, that just when Greeks also came to Him,
then He was slain, He saith to them, “This very thing specially causeth
them to come, and shall increase the preaching of Me.” Then since He
could not so well persuade them by words, He goeth about to prove this
from actual experience, telling them that this is the case with corn; it
beareth the more fruit when it hath died. “Now,” saith He, “if this be
the case with seeds, much more with Me.” But the disciples understood
not what was spoken. Wherefore the Evangelist continually putteth this,
 <span id="fr_1877"></span>[1878](#fn_1877.md) as making excuse for their
flight afterwards.  This same argument Paul also hath raised when
speaking of the Resurrection.

<span id="iv.lxviii-p45"></span>\[3.\] What sort of excuse then will
they have who disbelieve the Resurrection, when the action is practiced
each day, in seeds, in plants, and in the case of our own generation?
for first it is necessary that the seed die, and that then the
generation take place. But, in short, when God doeth anything,
reasonings are of no use; for how did He make us out of those things
that were not? This I say to Christians, who assert that they believe
the Scriptures; but I shall also say something else drawn from human
reasonings. Of men some live in vice, others in virtue; and of those who
live in vice, many have attained to extreme old age in prosperity, many
of the virtuous after enduring the contrary. When then shall each
receive his deserts? At what season? “Yea,” saith some one, “but there
is no resurrection of the body.” They hear not Paul, saying, “This
corruptible must put on incorruption.” ( [1 Cor. xv.
53](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#053.md) <span id="iv.lxviii-p45.1"></span>
.) He speaks not of the soul, for the soul is not corrupted; moreover,
“resurrection” is said of that which fell, and that which fell was the
body. But why wilt thou have it that there is no resurrection of the
body? Is it not possible with God? But this it were utter folly to say.
Is it unseemly? Why is it unseemly, that the corruptible which shared
the toil and death, should share also the crowns? For were it unseemly,
 <span id="fr_1878"></span>[1879](#fn_1878.md) it would not have been
created at the beginning, Christ would not have taken the flesh again.
But to show that He took it again and raised it up, hear what He saith:
“Reach  <span id="fr_1879"></span>[1880](#fn_1879.md) hither thy fingers” (
[John 20.27](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#027.md)<span
id="iv.lxviii-p47.5"></span> ); and, “Behold, a spirit hath not bones
and sinews.”  <span id="fr_1880"></span>[1881](#fn_1880.md) ( [Luke xxiv.
39](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#039.md) <span id="iv.lxviii-p48.3"></span>
.) But why did He raise Lazarus again, if it would have been better to
rise without a body? Why doth He this, classing it as a miracle and a
benefit? Why did He give nourishment at all? Be not therefore deceived
<span id="page_245">p. 245</span> <span id="iv.lxviii-Page_245"></span>
by the heretics, beloved: for there is a Resurrection and there is a
Judgment, but they deny these things, who desire not to give account of
their actions. For this Resurrection must be such as was that of Christ,
for He was the first fruits, the first born of the dead. But if the
Resurrection is this,  <span id="fr_1881"></span>[1882](#fn_1881.md) a
purifying of the soul, a deliverance from sin, and if Christ sinned not,
how did He rise again? And how have we been delivered from the curse, if
so be that He also sinned? And now saith He, “The prince of this world
cometh, and had nothing in Me”? ( [John
14.30](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#030.md)<span
id="iv.lxviii-p49.2"></span> .) They are the words of One declaring His
sinlessness. According to them therefore He either did not rise again;
or that He might rise,  <span id="fr_1882"></span>[1883](#fn_1882.md) He
sinned before His Resurrection. But He both rose again, and did no sin.
Therefore He rose in the Body, and these wicked doctrines are nothing
else than the offspring of vainglory. Let us then fly this malady. For,
It is saith, “evil communications corrupt good manners.” ( [1 Cor. xv.
33](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#033.md) <span id="iv.lxviii-p50.3"></span>
.) These are not the doctrines of the Apostles; Marcion and Valentius
have newly invented them. Let us then flee them, beloved, for a pure
life profits nothing when doctrines are corrupt; as on the other hand
neither do sound doctrines, if the life be corrupt. The heathen were the
parents of these notions, and those heretics reared them, having
received them from Gentile philosophers, asserting that matter is
uncreated, and many such like things. As then they asserted that there
could be no Artificer  <span id="fr_1883"></span>[1884](#fn_1883.md) unless
there were some uncreated subject matter, so also they disallowed the
Resurrection. But let us not heed them, as knowing that the power of God
is all sufficient.  <span id="fr_1884"></span>[1885](#fn_1884.md) Let us
not heed them. To you I say this; for *we* will not decline the battle
with them. But the man who is unarmed and naked, though he fall among
the weak, though he be the stronger, will easily be vanquished. Had you
given heed to the Scriptures, had you sharpened yourselves each day, I
would not have advised you to flee the combat with them, but would have
counseled you to grapple with them; for strong is truth. But since you
know not how to use the Scriptures, I fear the struggle, lest they take
you unarmed and cast you down. For there is nothing, there is nothing
weaker than those who are bereft of the aid of the Spirit. If these
heretics employ the wisdom of the Gentiles, we must not admire, but
laugh at them, because they employ foolish teachers. For those men were
not able to find out anything sound, either concerning God or the
creation, and things which the widow among us is acquainted with,
Pythagoras did not yet know, but said that the soul becomes a bush, or a
fish, or a dog. To these, tell me, ought you to give heed? And how could
it be reasonable to do so? They are great men in their district,  <span
id="fr_1885"></span>[1886](#fn_1885.md) grow beautiful curls, and are
enfolded in cloaks; thus far goes their philosophy; but if you look
within there is dust and ashes and nothing sound, but “their throat is
an open sepulcher” ( [Ps. v. 9](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#009.md) <span
id="iv.lxviii-p53.2"></span> ), having all things full of impurity and
corruption,  <span id="fr_1886"></span>[1887](#fn_1886.md) and all their
doctrines (full) of worms. For instance, the first of them said that
water was God, his successor fire, another one air, and  <span
id="fr_1887"></span>[1888](#fn_1887.md) they descended to things corporeal;
ought we then, tell me, to admire these, who never even had the thought
of the incorporeal God? and if they did ever gain it afterwards, it was
after conversing in Egypt with our people. But, that we bring not upon
you much confusion, let us here close our discourse. For should we begin
to set before you their doctrine, and what they have said about God,
what about matter, what about the soul, what about the body, much
ridicule will follow. And they will not even require to be accused by
us, for they have attacked each other; and he who wrote against us the
book concerning matter, made away with himself. Therefore that we may
not vainly delay you, nor wind together  <span
id="fr_1888"></span>[1889](#fn_1888.md) a labyrinth of words, leaving these
things we will bid you keep fast hold of the listening to the Holy
Scriptures, and not fight with  <span
id="fr_1889"></span>[1890](#fn_1889.md) words to no purpose; as also Paul
exhorteth Timothy ( [2 Tim. ii. 14](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#014.md)
<span id="iv.lxviii-p57.3"></span> ), filled though he was with much
wisdom, and possessing the power of miracles. Let us now obey him, and
leaving trifling; let us hold fast to real works, I mean to
brotherly-kindness and hospitality; and let us make much account of
alms-giving, that we may obtain the promised good things, through the
grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory for
endless ages.  <span id="fr_1890"></span>[1891](#fn_1890.md) Amen.
