<span id="iv.lxxii-p1"></span> <span class="c15"><span
id="iv.lxxii-p1.1"></span>Homily LXX.</span>

<span id="iv.lxxii-p2"></span> <span id="iv.lxxii-p2.1"></span> <span
class="c1"><span id="iv.lxxii-p2.2"></span>[John xiii.
1](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#001.md)<span
id="iv.lxxii-p2.3"></span></span>

<span id="iv.lxxii-p3"></span>“Now before the feast of the Passover,
when Jesus knew that His hour was come that He should depart out of this
world unto the Father, having loved His own which were in the world, He
loved them unto the end.”

<span id="iv.lxxii-p4"></span> \[1.\] “ <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.lxxii-p4.1"></span>Be</span> ye imitators of me,” said Paul, “as
I also am of Christ.” ( [1 Cor. xi. 1](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#001.md)
<span id="iv.lxxii-p4.2"></span> .) For on this account He took also
flesh of our substance,  <span id="fr_1954"></span>[1955](#fn_1954.md) that
by means of it He might teach us virtue. For (“God sending His own Son)
in the likeness of sinful flesh,” it saith, “and for sin condemned sin
in the flesh.” ( [Rom. viii. 3](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#003.md) <span
id="iv.lxxii-p5.3"></span> .) And Christ Himself  <span
id="fr_1955"></span>[1956](#fn_1955.md) saith, “Learn of Me, for I am meek
and lowly in heart.” ( [Matt. xi. 29](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#029.md)
<span id="iv.lxxii-p6.3"></span> .) And this He taught, not by words
alone, but by actions also. For they called Him a Samaritan, and one
that had a devil, and a deceiver, and cast stones at Him; and at one
time the Pharisees sent servants to take  <span
id="fr_1956"></span>[1957](#fn_1956.md) Him, at another they sent plotters
against Him; and they continued <span id="page_255">p. 255</span> <span
id="iv.lxxii-Page_255"></span> also insulting Him themselves, and that
when they had no fault to find, but were even being continually
benefited. Still after such conduct He ceaseth not to do well to them
both by words and deeds. And, when a certain domestic smote Him on the
face, He said, “If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil, but if
well, why smitest thou Me?” ( [John
18.23](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#023.md)<span id="iv.lxxii-p7.3"></span>
.) But this was to those who hated and plotted against Him. Let us see
also what He doeth now towards the disciples, or rather what actions He
now exhibiteth  <span id="fr_1957"></span>[1958](#fn_1957.md) towards the
traitor. The man whom most of all there was reason  <span
id="fr_1958"></span>[1959](#fn_1958.md) to hate, because being a disciple,
having shared the table and the salt, having seen the miracles and been
deemed worthy of such great things, he acted more grievously than any,
not stoning indeed, nor insulting Him, but betraying and giving Him up,
observe in how friendly sort He receiveth this man, washing his feet;
for even in this way He desired to restrain him from that wickedness.
Yet it was in His power, had He willed it, to have withered him like the
fig-tree, to have cut him in two as He rent the rocks, to have cleft him
asunder like the veil; but He would not lead him away from his design by
compulsion, but by choice. Wherefore He washed his feet; and not even by
this was that wretched and miserable man shamed.

<span id="iv.lxxii-p10"></span> “Before the feast of the Passover,” it
saith, “Jesus knowing that His hour was come.” Not then “knowing,” but
(it means) that He did what He did having “known” long ago. “That He
should depart.” Magnificently  <span
id="fr_1959"></span>[1960](#fn_1959.md) the Evangelist calleth His death,
“departure.” “Having loved His own, He loved them unto the end.” Seest
thou how when about to leave them He showeth greater love? For the,
“having loved, He loved them unto the end,” showeth that he omitted
nothing of the things which it was likely that one who earnestly loved
would do. Why, then did He not this from the beginning? He worketh
 <span id="fr_1960"></span>[1961](#fn_1960.md) the greatest things last, so
as to render more intense their attachment, and to lay up for them
beforehand much comfort, against the terrible things that were about to
fall on them. St. John calls them “His own,” in respect of personal
attachment, since he calls others also “His own,” in respect of the work
of creation; as when he saith, “His own received Him not.” ( [John
1.11](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#011.md)<span id="iv.lxxii-p12.3"></span>
.) But what meaneth, “which were in the world”? Because the dead also
were “His own,” Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and the men of that sort,  <span
id="fr_1961"></span>[1962](#fn_1961.md) but they were not in the world.
Seest thou that He is the God both of the Old and New (Testament)? But
what meaneth, “He loved them unto the end”? It stands for, “He continued
loving them unceasingly,” and this the Evangelist mentions as a sure
proof of great affection. Elsewhere indeed He spake of another (proof),
the laying down life for His friends; but that had not yet come to pass.
And wherefore did He this thing “now”? Because it was far more wonderful
at a time when He appeared more glorious in the sight of all men.
Besides, He left them no small consolation now that He was about to
depart, for since they were going to be greatly grieved, He by these
means introduceth also comfort to the grief.

<span id="iv.lxxii-p14"></span> [John
13.2](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#002.md)<span id="iv.lxxii-p14.1"></span>
. “And supper being ended, the devil having now put it into the heart of
Judas  <span id="fr_1962"></span>[1963](#fn_1962.md) to betray Him.”

<span id="iv.lxxii-p16"></span> This the Evangelist hath said  <span
id="fr_1963"></span>[1964](#fn_1963.md) amazed, showing that Jesus washed
the man who had already chosen to betray Him. This also proves his great
wickedness, that not even the having shared the salt restrained him, (a
thing which is most able to restrain wickedness;) not the fact that even
up to the last day, his Master continued to bear with him.  <span
id="fr_1964"></span>[1965](#fn_1964.md)

<span id="iv.lxxii-p19"></span> [John
13.3](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#003.md)<span id="iv.lxxii-p19.1"></span>
. “Jesus knowing that the Father had given  <span
id="fr_1965"></span>[1966](#fn_1965.md) all things into His hands, and that
He was come from God, and went to God.”

<span id="iv.lxxii-p21"></span> Here the Evangelist saith, even  <span
id="fr_1966"></span>[1967](#fn_1966.md) wondering, that one so great, so
very great, who came from God and went to Him, who ruleth over all, did
this thing, and disdained not even so to undertake such an action. And
by the “giving over,” methinks St. John means the salvation of the
faithful. For when He saith, “All things are given over  <span
id="fr_1967"></span>[1968](#fn_1967.md) to Me of My Father” ( [Matt. xi.
27](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#027.md) <span id="iv.lxxii-p23.3"></span>
), He speaketh of this kind of giving over; as also in another place He
saith, “Thine they were, and Thou gavest them Me” ( [John
17.6](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#006.md)<span id="iv.lxxii-p23.4"></span>
); and again, “No man can come unto Me except the Father draw him” (
[John 6.44](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#044.md)<span
id="iv.lxxii-p23.5"></span> ); and, “Except it be given him from
heaven.” ( [John 3.27](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#027.md)<span
id="iv.lxxii-p23.6"></span> .) The Evangelist then either means this, or
that Christ would be nothing lessened by this action, since He came from
God, and went to God, and possessed all things. But when thou hearest of
“giving over,” understand it in no human sense, for it showeth how He
honoreth the Father, and His unanimity with Him. For as the Father
giveth over to Him, so He to the Father. And this Paul declares, saying,
“When He shall have given over  <span
id="fr_1968"></span>[1969](#fn_1968.md) the kingdom to God, even the
Father.” ( [1 Cor. xv. 24](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#024.md) <span
id="iv.lxxii-p24.3"></span> .) But St. John hath said it here in a more
human sense, showing His great care for them, and declaring His
unutterable love, that He now cared for them as for His own; teaching
them the mother of all good, even <span id="page_256">p. 256</span>
<span id="iv.lxxii-Page_256"></span> humblemindedness, which He said was
both the beginning and the end of virtue. And not without a reason is
added the,  <span id="fr_1969"></span>[1970](#fn_1969.md) “He came from God
and went to God”: but that we may learn that He did what was worthy
 <span id="fr_1970"></span>[1971](#fn_1970.md) of One who came thence and
went thither, trampling down all pride.

<span id="iv.lxxii-p27"></span> [John
13.4](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#004.md)<span id="iv.lxxii-p27.1"></span>
. “And having risen  <span id="fr_1971"></span>[1972](#fn_1971.md) from
supper, and laid aside His garments.”  <span
id="fr_1972"></span>[1973](#fn_1972.md)

<span id="iv.lxxii-p30"></span> \[2.\] Observe how not by the washing
only, but in another way also He exhibiteth humility. For it was not
before reclining, but after they had all sat down, then He arose. In the
next place, He doth not merely wash them, but doth so, putting off His
garments. And He did not even stop here, but girded Himself with a
towel. Nor was He satisfied with this, but Himself filled (the basin),
and did not bid another fill it; He did all these things Himself,
showing by all that we must do such things, when we are engaged in well
doing, not merely for form’s sake,  <span
id="fr_1973"></span>[1974](#fn_1973.md) but with all zeal. Now He seemeth
to me to have washed the feet of the traitor first from its saying,

<span id="iv.lxxii-p32"></span> [John
13.5](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#005.md)<span id="iv.lxxii-p32.1"></span>
. “He began to wash the disciples’ feet,”  <span
id="fr_1974"></span>[1975](#fn_1974.md) and adding,

<span id="iv.lxxii-p34"></span> [John
13.6](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#006.md)<span id="iv.lxxii-p34.1"></span>
. “Then cometh He to Simon Peter and Peter saith unto Him, Lord, dost
Thou wash my feet?”

<span id="iv.lxxii-p35"></span> “With those hands,” he saith, “with
which Thou hast opened eyes, and cleansed lepers, and raised the dead?”
For this (question) is very emphatic; wherefore He needed not to have
said any more than the, “Thou”; for even of itself this would have
sufficed to convey the whole. Some one might reasonably enquire, how
none of the others forbade Him, but Peter only, which was a mark of no
slight love and reverence. What then is the cause? He seemeth to me to
have washed the traitor first, then to have come to Peter, and that the
others were afterwards instructed from his case.  <span
id="fr_1975"></span>[1976](#fn_1975.md) That He washed some one other
before him is clear from its saying, “But when He came  <span
id="fr_1976"></span>[1977](#fn_1976.md) to Peter.” Yet the Evangelist is
not a vehement accuser,  <span id="fr_1977"></span>[1978](#fn_1977.md) for
the “began,” is the expression of one implying this. And even if Peter
were the first,  <span id="fr_1978"></span>[1979](#fn_1978.md) yet it is
probable that the traitor, being a forward person, had reclined even
before the chief.  <span id="fr_1979"></span>[1980](#fn_1979.md) For by
another circumstance also his forwardness is shown, when He dippeth with
his Master in the dish, and being convicted, feels no compunction; while
Peter being rebuked but once on a former occasion, and for words which
he spake from loving affection, was so abashed, that being even
distressed and trembling, he begged another to ask a question. But
Judas, though continually convicted, felt not. ( [John
13.24](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#024.md)<span id="iv.lxxii-p40.2"></span>
.) When therefore He came to Peter, he saith unto Him, “Lord, dost Thou
wash my feet?”

<span id="iv.lxxii-p41"></span> [John
13.7](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#007.md)<span id="iv.lxxii-p41.1"></span>
. “He saith unto him, What I do thou knowest not now, but thou shalt
know here after.”

<span id="iv.lxxii-p42"></span>That is “thou shalt know how great is the
gain from this, the profit of the lesson, and how it is able to guide us
into all humblemindedness.” What then doth Peter? He still hinders Him,
and saith,

<span id="iv.lxxii-p43"></span> [John
13.8](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#008.md)<span id="iv.lxxii-p43.1"></span>
. “Thou shalt never wash my feet.” “What doest thou, Peter? Rememberest
thou not those former words? Saidst thou not, ‘Be merciful to Thyself,’
 <span id="fr_1980"></span>[1981](#fn_1980.md) and heardest thou not in
return, ‘Get thee behind Me, Satan’? ( [Matt. xvi.
22](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#022.md) <span id="iv.lxxii-p44.3"></span>
.) Art thou not even so sobered, but art thou yet vehement?” “Yea,” he
saith, “for what is being done is a great matter, and full of
amazement.” Since then he did this from exceeding love, Christ in turn
subdueth him by the same; and as there He effected this by sharply
rebuking him, and saying, “Thou art an offense unto Me,” so here also by
saying,

<span id="iv.lxxii-p45"></span>“If I wash thee not, thou hast no part
with Me.” What then saith that hot and burning one?

<span id="iv.lxxii-p46"></span> [John
13.9](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#009.md)<span id="iv.lxxii-p46.1"></span>
. “Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.”

<span id="iv.lxxii-p47"></span>Vehement in deprecation, he becometh yet
more vehement in acquiescence; but both from love. For why said He not
wherefore He did this, instead of adding a threat? Because Peter would
not have been persuaded. For had He said, “Suffer it, for by this I
persuade you to be humbleminded,” Peter would have promised it ten
thousand times, in order that his Master might not do this thing. But
now what saith He? He speaketh of that which Peter most feared and
dreaded, the being separated from Him; for it is he who continually
asks, “Whither goest Thou?” ( [John
13.36](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#036.md)<span id="iv.lxxii-p47.1"></span>
.) Wherefore also he said, “I will give  <span
id="fr_1981"></span>[1982](#fn_1981.md) even my life for Thee.” ( [John
13.37](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#037.md)<span id="iv.lxxii-p48.3"></span>
.) And if, after hearing, “What I do thou knowest not now, but thou
shalt know hereafter,” he still persisted, much more would he have done
so had he learnt (the meaning of the action). Therefore said He, “but
thou shalt know hereafter,” as being aware, that should he learn it
immediately he would still resist. And Peter said not, “Tell me, that I
may suffer Thee,” but (which was much more vehement) he did not even
endure to learn, but withstands Him,  <span
id="fr_1982"></span>[1983](#fn_1982.md) <span id="page_257">p. 257</span>
<span id="iv.lxxii-Page_257"></span> saying, “Thou shalt never wash my
feet.” But as soon as He threatened, he straightway relaxed his tone.
But what meaneth, “Thou shalt know after this”? “After this?” When?
“When in My Name thou shalt have cast out devils; when thou shalt have
seen Me taken up into Heaven, when thou shalt have learnt from the
Spirit  <span id="fr_1983"></span>[1984](#fn_1983.md) that I sit  <span
id="fr_1984"></span>[1985](#fn_1984.md) on His right hand, then shalt thou
understand what is being done now.” What then saith Christ? When Peter
said, “not my feet only, but also my hands and my head,” He replieth,

<span id="iv.lxxii-p52"></span> [John
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#010.md),
[11](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#011.md)<span id="iv.lxxii-p52.1"></span> .
“He that is washed, needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean
every whit; and ye are clean,  <span
id="fr_1985"></span>[1986](#fn_1985.md) but not all. For He knew who should
betray Him.”  <span id="fr_1986"></span>[1987](#fn_1986.md)

<span id="iv.lxxii-p55"></span> “And if they are clean, why washeth He
 <span id="fr_1987"></span>[1988](#fn_1987.md) their feet?” That we may
learn to be modest.  <span id="fr_1988"></span>[1989](#fn_1988.md) On which
account He came not to any other part of the body, but to that which is
considered more dishonorable than the rest. But what is, “He that is
washed”? It is instead of, “he that is clean.” Were they then clean, who
had not  <span id="fr_1989"></span>[1990](#fn_1989.md) yet been delivered
from their sins, nor deemed worthy of the Spirit, since sin still had
the mastery, the handwriting of the curse still remaining, the victim
not having yet been offered? How then calleth He them “clean”? That thou
mayest not deem them clean, as delivered from their sins, He addeth,
 <span id="fr_1990"></span>[1991](#fn_1990.md) Behold, “ye are clean
through the word that I have spoken unto you.” That is, “In this way ye
are so far  <span id="fr_1991"></span>[1992](#fn_1991.md) clean; ye have
received the light, ye have been freed from Jewish error. For the
Prophet also saith, ‘Wash you, make you clean, put away the wickedness
from your souls’ ( [Isa. i. 16](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#016.md) <span
id="iv.lxxii-p60.2"></span> , LXX.); so that such a one is washed and is
clean.” Since then these men had cast away all wickedness from their
souls, and had companied with Him with a pure mind, therefore He saith
according to the word of the Prophet, “he that is washed is clean
already.” For in that place also It meaneth not the “washing” of water,
practiced by the Jews; but the cleansing of the conscience.  <span
id="fr_1992"></span>[1993](#fn_1992.md)

<span id="iv.lxxii-p62"></span>\[3.\] Be we then also clean; learn we to
do well. But what is “well”?  “Judge for the fatherless, plead for the
widow; and come, let us reason together, saith the Lord.” ( [Isa. i.
7](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#007) <span id="iv.lxxii-p62.1"></span> ..md)
There is frequent mention in the Scriptures of widows and orphans, but
we make no account of this. Yet consider how great is the reward.
“Though,” it saith, “your sins be as scarlet, I will whiten them as
snow; though they be red like crimson, I will whiten them as wool.” For
a widow is an unprotected being, therefore He  <span
id="fr_1993"></span>[1994](#fn_1993.md) taketh much care for her. For they,
when it is even in their power to contract a second marriage, endure the
hardships of widowhood through fear of God. Let us then all, both men
and women, stretch forth our hands to them, that we may never undergo
the sorrows of widow-hood; or if we should have to undergo them, let us
lay up  <span id="fr_1994"></span>[1995](#fn_1994.md) a great store of
kindness for ourselves. Not small is the power of the widow’s tears, it
is able to open heaven itself. Let us not then trample on them, nor make
their calamity worse, but assist them by every means. If so we do, we
shall put around  <span id="fr_1995"></span>[1996](#fn_1995.md) ourselves
much safety, both in the present life, and in that which is to come. For
not here alone, but there also will they be our defenders, cutting away
most of our sins by reason of our beneficence towards them, and causing
us to stand boldly before the judgment-seat of Christ. Which  <span
id="fr_1996"></span>[1997](#fn_1996.md) may it come to pass that we all
obtain, through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ,
to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
