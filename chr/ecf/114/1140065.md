<span id="iv.lxii-p3"></span>“I am the Good Shepherd, and know My sheep,
and am known of Mine. As the Father knoweth Me, even so know I the
Father; and I lay down My life for the sheep.”

<span id="iv.lxii-p4"></span> \[1.\] <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.lxii-p4.1"></span>A great</span> matter, beloved, a great matter
it is to preside over a Church: a matter needing wisdom and courage as
great as that of which Christ speaketh, that a man should lay down his
life for the sheep, and never leave them deserted or naked; that he
should stand against the wolf nobly. For in this the shepherd differs
from the hireling; the one always looks to his own safety, caring not
for the sheep; the other always seeks that of the sheep, neglecting his
own. Having therefore mentioned the marks of a shepherd, Christ hath put
two kinds of spoilers; one, the thief who kills and steals; the other,
one who doth not these things, but who when they are done doth not give
heed nor hinder them. By the first, pointing to Theudas and those like
him; by the second, exposing the teachers of the Jews, who neither cared
for nor thought about the sheep entrusted to them. On which account
Ezekiel of old rebuked them, and said, “Woe,  <span
id="fr_1605"></span>[1606](#fn_1605.md) ye shepherds of Israel! Do the
shepherds feed themselves? Do not the shepherds feed the sheep?” (
[Ezek. xxxiv. 2](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#002.md) <span
id="iv.lxii-p5.3"></span> , LXX.) But they did the contrary, which is
the worst kind of wickedness, and the cause of all the rest. Wherefore
It saith, “They have not turned back the strayed, nor sought the lost,
nor bound up the broken, nor healed the sick, because they fed
themselves and not the sheep.” ( [Ezek. xxxiv.
4](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#004) <span id="iv.lxii-p5.4"></span> ..md) 
As Paul also hath declared in another passage, saying, “For all seek
their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ’s” ( [Philip. ii.
21](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#021) <span id="iv.lxii-p5.5"></span> .md);
and again, “Let no man seek his own, but every man his neighbor’s.” ( [1
Cor. x. 24](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#024.md) <span
id="iv.lxii-p5.6"></span> .) <span id="page_215">p. 215</span> <span
id="iv.lxii-Page_215"></span> From both Christ distinguisheth Himself;
from those who came to spoil, by saying, “I am come that they might have
life, and that they might have more abundantly” ( [John
10.10](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#010.md)<span id="iv.lxii-p5.7"></span>
); and from those who cared not for the sheep being carried away by
wolves, by never deserting them, but even laying down His life for them,
that the sheep might not perish. For when they desired to kill Him, He
neither altered His teaching, nor betrayed those who believed on Him,
but stood firm, and chose to die. Wherefore He continually said, “I am
the good Shepherd.” Then because His words appeared to be unsupported by
testimony, (for though the, “I lay down My life,” was not long after
proved, yet the, “that they might have life, and that they might have
more abundantly,” was to come to pass after their departure hence in the
life to come,) what doth He? He proveth one from the other; by giving
His mortal life  <span id="fr_1606"></span>[1607](#fn_1606) (He proveth.md)
that He giveth life immortal.  <span
id="fr_1607"></span>[1608](#fn_1607.md) As Paul also saith, “If when we
were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of His Son, much
more being reconciled we shall be saved.” ( [Rom. v.
10](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#010) <span id="iv.lxii-p7.2"></span> ..md)
And again in another place, “He that spared not His own Son, but
delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give
us all things?” ( [Rom. viii. 32](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#032.md) <span
id="iv.lxii-p7.3"></span> .)

<span id="iv.lxii-p8"></span>But wherefore do they not now bring against
Him the charge which they did before, when they said, “Thou bearest
witness of thyself, thy witness is not true?” ( [John
8.13](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#013)<span id="iv.lxii-p8.1"></span> ..md)
Because He had often stopped their mouths, and because His boldness
towards them had been increased by His miracles. Then because He said
above “And the sheep hear his voice, and follow him,” lest any should
say, “What then is this to those who believe not?” hear what He addeth,
“And I know My sheep, and am known of Mine.” As Paul declared when he
said, “God hath not rejected His people whom He foreknew” ( [Rom. xi.
2](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#002) <span id="iv.lxii-p8.2"></span> .md);
and Moses, “The Lord knew those that were His” ( [2 Tim.
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#019.md), [Num.
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#005)<span id="iv.lxii-p8.3"></span> .md);
“those,” He saith, “I mean, whom He  <span
id="fr_1608"></span>[1609](#fn_1608.md) foreknew.” Then that thou mayest
not deem the measure of knowledge to be equal, hear how He setteth the
matter right by adding, “I know My sheep, and am known of Mine.” But the
knowledge is not equal. “Where is it equal?” In the case of the Father
and Me, for there, “As the Father knoweth Me, even so know I the
Father.” Had He not wished to prove this, why should He have added that
expression? Because He often ranked Himself among the many, therefore,
lest any one should deem that He knew as a man knoweth, He added, “As
the Father knoweth Me, even so know I the Father.” “I know Him as
exactly as He knoweth Me.” Wherefore He said, “No man knoweth the Son
 <span id="fr_1609"></span>[1610](#fn_1609.md) save the Father, nor the
Father save the Son” ( [Luke x. 22](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#022.md)
<span id="iv.lxii-p10.3"></span> ), speaking of a distinct kind of
knowledge, and such as no other can possess.

<span id="iv.lxii-p11"></span>\[2.\] “I lay down My life.” This He saith
continually, to show that He is no deceiver. So also the Apostle, when
he desired to show that he was a genuine teacher, and was arguing
against the false apostles, established his authority by his dangers and
deaths, saying, “In stripes above measure, in deaths oft.” ( [2 Cor. xi.
23](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#023) <span id="iv.lxii-p11.1"></span> ..md)
For to say, “I am light,” and “I am life,” seemed to the foolish to be a
matter of pride; but to say, “I am willing to die,” admitted not any
malice or envy. Wherefore they do not say to Him, “Thou bearest witness
of thyself, thy witness is not true,” for the speech manifested very
tender care for them, if indeed He was willing to give Himself for those
who would have stoned Him. On this account also He seasonably
introduceth mention of the Gentiles;

<span id="iv.lxii-p12"></span> [John
10.16](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#016.md)<span id="iv.lxii-p12.1"></span>
. “For other sheep also I have,” He saith, “which are not of this fold,
them also must I bring.”

<span id="iv.lxii-p13"></span>Observe again, the word “must,” here used,
doth not express necessity, but is declaratory of something which will
certainly come to pass. As though He had said, “Why marvel ye if these
shall follow Me, and if My sheep shall hear My voice? When ye shall see
others also following Me and hearing My voice, then shall ye be
astonished more.” And be not confounded when you hear Him say, “which
are not of this fold” ( [Gal. v. 6](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#006.md)
<span id="iv.lxii-p13.1"></span> ), for the difference relateth to the
Law only, as also Paul saith, “Neither circumcision availeth anything,
nor uncircumcision.”

<span id="iv.lxii-p14"></span>“Them also must I bring.” He showeth that
both these and those were scattered and mixed, and without shepherds,
because the good Shepherd had not yet come. Then He proclaimeth
beforehand their future union, that,

<span id="iv.lxii-p15"></span> “They shall be one fold.”  <span
id="fr_1610"></span>[1611](#fn_1610.md)

<span id="iv.lxii-p17"></span> Which same thing also Paul  <span
id="fr_1611"></span>[1612](#fn_1611.md) declared, saying, “For to make in
Himself of twain one new man.” ( [Eph. ii.
15](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#015) <span id="iv.lxii-p18.3"></span> ..md)

<span id="iv.lxii-p19"></span> [John
10.17](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#017.md)<span id="iv.lxii-p19.1"></span>
. “Therefore doth My Father love Me, because I lay down My life, that I
might take it again.”

<span id="iv.lxii-p20"></span>What could be more full of humanity than
this saying, if so be that on our account our Lord shall be beloved,
because He dieth for us? What then? tell me, was He not beloved during
the time before this; did the Father now begin to love Him, and were we
the causes of His love? Seest thou how He used condescension? But what
doth He here desire to prove? Because <span id="page_216">p. 216</span>
<span id="iv.lxii-Page_216"></span> they said that He was alien from the
Father, and a deceiver, and had come to ruin and destroy He telleth
them, “This if nothing else would persuade Me to love you, namely, your
being so beloved by the Father, that I also am beloved by Him, because I
die for you.” Besides this He desireth also to prove that other point,
that He came not to the action unwillingly, (for it unwillingly, how
could what was done cause love?) and that this was especially known to
the Father. And if He speaketh as a man, marvel not, for we have often
mentioned the cause of this, and to say again the same things is
superfluous and unpleasant.

<span id="iv.lxii-p21"></span>“I lay down My life, that I might take it
again.”

<span id="iv.lxii-p22"></span> [John
10.18](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#018.md)<span id="iv.lxii-p22.1"></span>
. “No man taketh it from Me, but I lay it down of Myself.  I have power
to lay it down, and I have power to take it again.”

<span id="iv.lxii-p23"></span> Because they often took counsel to kill
Him, He telleth them, “Except I will, your labor is unavailing.” And by
the first He proveth the second, by the Death, the Resurrection. For
this is the strange and wonderful thing. Since both took place in a new
way, and beyond ordinary custom. But let us give heed exactly to what He
saith, “I have power to lay down My life.” And who hath not “power to
lay down his life”? Since it is in the power of any that will, to kill
himself. But He saith it not so, but how? “I have in such a way the
power to lay it down, that no one can effect this against My will.” And
this is a power not belonging to men; for we have no power to lay it
down in any other way than by killing ourselves. And if we fall into the
hands of men who plot against us, and have the power to kill us, we no
longer are free to lay it down or not, but even against our will they
take it from us. Now this was not the case with Christ, but even when
others plotted against Him, He had power not to lay it down. Having
therefore said that, “No man taketh it from Me,” He addeth, “I have
power to lay down My life,” that is, “I alone can decide as to laying it
down,” a thing which doth not rest with us,  <span
id="fr_1612"></span>[1613](#fn_1612.md) for many others also are able to
take it from us. Now this He said not at first, (since the assertion
would not have seemed credible,) but when He had received the testimony
of facts, and when, having often plotted against Him, they had been
unable to lay hold on Him, (for He escaped from their hands ten thousand
times,) He then saith, “No man taketh it from me.” But if this be true,
that other point follows, that He came to death voluntarily. And if this
be true, the next point is also certain, that He can “take it again”
when He will. For if the dying  <span
id="fr_1613"></span>[1614](#fn_1613.md) was a greater thing than man could
do, doubt no more about the other. Since the fact that He alone was able
to let go His life, showeth that He was able by the same power to take
it again. Seest thou how from the first He proved the second, and from
His death showed that His Resurrection was indisputable?

<span id="iv.lxii-p26"></span>“This commandment have I received of My
Father.”

<span id="iv.lxii-p27"></span>What commandment was this? To die for the
world. Did He then wait first to hear, and then choose, and had He need
of learning it? Who that had sense would assert this? But before when He
said, “Therefore doth My Father love Me,” He showed that the first
motion was voluntary, and removed all suspicion of opposition to the
Father; so here when He saith that He received a commandment from the
Father, He declared nothing save that, “this which I do seemeth good to
Him,” in order that when they should slay Him, they might not think that
they had slain Him as one deserted and given up by the Father, nor
reproach Him with such reproaches as they did, “He saved others, himself
he cannot save”; and, “If thou be the Son of God, come down from the
cross” ( [Matt. 27:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#042.md),
[40](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#040)<span id="iv.lxii-p27.1"></span> .md);
yet the very reason of His not coming down was, that He was the Son of
God.

<span id="iv.lxii-p28"></span> \[3.\] Then lest on hearing that, “I have
received a command from the Father,” thou shouldest deem that the
achievement  <span id="fr_1614"></span>[1615](#fn_1614.md) doth not belong
to Him, He hath said preventing the, “The good Shepherd layeth down His
life for the sheep”; showing by this that the sheep were His, and that
all which took place was His achievement, and that He needed no command.
For had He needed a commandment, how could He have said, “I lay it down
of Myself”? for He that layeth it down of Himself needeth no
commandment. He also assigneth the cause for which He doeth this. And
what is that? That He is the Shepherd, and the good Shepherd. Now the
good Shepherd needeth no one to arouse him to his duty; and if this be
the case with man, much more is it so with God. Wherefore Paul said,
that “He emptied Himself.” ( [Philip. ii.
7](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007) <span id="iv.lxii-p29.2"></span> ..md)
So the “commandment” put here means nothing else, but to show His
unanimity with the Father; and if He speaketh in so humble and human a
way, the cause is the infirmity of His hearers.

<span id="iv.lxii-p30"></span> [John
10.19](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#019.md)<span id="iv.lxii-p30.1"></span>
. “There was a division therefore  <span
id="fr_1615"></span>[1616](#fn_1615.md) among the Jews.  <span
id="fr_1616"></span>[1617](#fn_1616.md) And some  <span
id="fr_1617"></span>[1618](#fn_1617.md) said, He hath a devil (and is mad
 <span id="fr_1618"></span>[1619](#fn_1618) .md). Others said, These are
not the words of him that hath a devil: can a devil open the eyes of the
blind?”

<span id="iv.lxii-p35"></span>For because His words were greater than
belonged to man, and not of common use, they <span id="page_217">p.
217</span> <span id="iv.lxii-Page_217"></span> said that He had a devil,
calling Him so now for the fourth time. For they before had said, “Thou
hast a devil, who seeketh to kill thee?” ( [John
7.20](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#020.md)<span id="iv.lxii-p35.1"></span>
); and again, “Said we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a
devil?” ( [John 8.48](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#048.md)<span
id="iv.lxii-p35.2"></span> ); and here, “He hath a devil and is mad, why
hear ye him?” Or rather we should say, that He heard this not for the
fourth time, but frequently. For to ask, “Said we not well that thou
hast a devil?” is a sign that they had said so not twice or thrice, but
many times. “Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a
devil:  can a devil open the eyes of the blind?” For since they could
not silence their opponents by words, they now brought proof from His
works. “Certainly neither are the words those of one that hath a devil,
yet if ye are not persuaded by the words, be ye shamed by the works. For
if they are not the acts of one that hath a devil, and are greater than
belong to man, it is quite clear that they proceed from some divine
power.” Seest thou the argument? That they were greater than belonged to
man is plain, from the Jews saying, “He hath a devil”; that He had not a
devil, He showed by what He did.

<span id="iv.lxii-p36"></span>What then did Christ? He answered nothing
to these things. Before this He had replied, “I have not a devil”; but
not so now; for since He had afforded proof by His actions, He
afterwards held His peace. For neither were they worthy of an answer,
who said that He was possessed of a devil, on account of those actions
for which they ought to have admired and deemed Him to be God. And how
were any farther refutations from Him needed, when they opposed and
refuted each other? Wherefore He was silent, and bore all mildly. And
not for this reason alone, but also to teach us all meekness and
long-suffering.

<span id="iv.lxii-p37"></span> \[4.\] Let us now imitate Him. For not
only did He now hold His peace, but even came among them again,  <span
id="fr_1619"></span>[1620](#fn_1619.md) and being questioned answered and
showed the things relating to His foreknowledge; and though called
“demoniac” and “madman,” by men who had received from Him ten thousand
benefits, and that not once or twice but many times, not only did He
refrain from avenging Himself, but even ceased not to benefit them. To
benefit, do I say? He laid down His life for them, and while being
crucified spake in their behalf to His Father. This then let us also
imitate, for to be a disciple of Christ, is the being gentle and kind.
But whence can this gentleness come to us? If we continually reckon up
our sins, if we mourn, if we weep; for neither doth a soul that dwelleth
in the company of so much grief endure to be provoked or angered. Since
wherever there is mourning, it is impossible that there should be anger;
where grief is, all anger is out of the way; where there is brokenness
of spirit, there is no provocation. For the mind, when scourged by
sorrow, hath not leisure to be roused, but will groan  <span
id="fr_1620"></span>[1621](#fn_1620.md) bitterly, and weep yet more
bitterly. I know that many laugh on hearing these things, but I will not
cease to lament for the laughers. For the present is a time for
mourning, and wailings, and lamentations, since we do many sins both in
word and deed, and hell awaiteth those who commit such transgressions,
and the river boiling with a roaring stream of fire, and banishment from
the Kingdom, which is the most grievous thing of all. When these things
then are threatened, tell me, dost thou laugh and bear thee proudly? And
when thy Lord is angered and threatening, dost thou stand careless,
 <span id="fr_1621"></span>[1622](#fn_1621.md) and fearest thou not lest by
this thou light for thyself the furnace to a blaze? Hearest thou not
what He crieth out every day? “Ye saw Me  <span
id="fr_1622"></span>[1623](#fn_1622.md) an hungered, and gave Me no meat;
thirsty, and ye gave Me no drink; depart ye into the fire prepared for
the devil and his angels.” ( [Matt.
xxv](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#000.md) <span id="iv.lxii-p41.3"></span>
.) And these things He threatened every day. “But,” saith some one, “I
did give Him meat.” When, and for how many days? Ten or twenty? But He
willeth it not merely for so much time as this, but as much as thou
spendest upon earth. For the virgins also had oil, yet not sufficient
for their salvation; they too lighted their lamps, yet they were shut
out from the bridechamber. And with reason, since the lamps had gone out
before the coming of the Bridegroom. On this account we need much oil,
and abundant lovingkindness. Hear at least what the Prophet saith, “Have
mercy upon me, O God, according to Thy great mercy.” ( [Ps. li.
1](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#001) <span id="iv.lxii-p41.4"></span> ..md)
We therefore must so take pity upon our neighbor, according to His great
mercy towards us. For such as we are towards our fellow-servants, such
shall we find our Lord towards ourselves. And what kind of “mercy” is
“great”? When we give not of our abundance, but of our deficiency. But
if we give not even of our abundance, what hope shall there be for us?
Whence shall we have deliverance from those woes? Where shall we be
enabled to flee and to find salvation? For if the virgins after so many
and so great toils found no comfort anywhere, who shall stand forth for
us when we hear those fearful words of the Judge Himself, addressing and
reproaching us, because “I was an hungered, and ye gave Me no meat; for
inasmuch,” It saith, “as ye did it not unto one of the least of these,
ye did it not unto Me”; saying this not <span id="page_218">p.
218</span> <span id="iv.lxii-Page_218"></span> merely of His disciples,
nor of those who have taken upon themselves the ascetic life, but of
every faithful man. For such an one though he be a slave, or one of
those that beg in the market-place, yet if he believeth in God, ought by
right to enjoy all our good will. And if we neglect such an one when
naked or hungry, we shall hear those words. With reason. For what
difficult or grievous thing hath He demanded of us? What that is not of
the very lightest and easiest? He saith not, “I was sick, and ye
restored Me not,” but, “and ye visited Me not.” He saith not, “I was in
prison, and ye delivered Me not,” but, “and ye came not unto Me.” In
proportion therefore as the commands are easy, so is the punishment
greater to them that disobey. For what is easier, tell me, than to walk
forth and enter into a prison? And what more pleasant? For when thou
seest some bound, others covered with filth, others with uncut hair and
clothed in rags, others perishing with hunger, and running like dogs to
your feet, others with deep ploughed sides,  <span
id="fr_1623"></span>[1624](#fn_1623.md) others now returning in chains from
the market-place, who beg all day and do not collect even necessary
sustenance, and yet at evening are required by those set over them to
furnish that wicked and savage service;  <span
id="fr_1624"></span>[1625](#fn_1624.md) though thou be like any stone, thou
wilt certainly be rendered kinder; though thou livest a soft and
dissipated life, thou wilt certainly become wiser, when thou observest
the nature of human affairs in other men’s misfortunes; for thou wilt
surely gain an idea of that fearful day, and of its varied punishments.
Revolving and considering these things, thou wilt certainly cast out
both wrath and pleasure, and the love of worldly things, and wilt make
thy soul more calm than the calmest harbor; and thou wilt reason
concerning that Judgment seat, reflecting that if among men there is so
much forethought, and order, and terror, and threatenings, much more
will there be with God. “For there is no power but from God.” ( [Rom.
xiii. 1](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#001.md) <span
id="iv.lxii-p43.3"></span> .) He therefore who permitteth rulers to
order these things thus, will much more do the same Himself.

<span id="iv.lxii-p44"></span> \[5.\] And certainly were there not this
fear, all would be lost, when though such punishments hang over them,
there are many who go over to the side of wickedness. These things if
thou wisely observe, thou wilt be more ready-minded towards alms-doing,
and wilt reap much pleasure, far greater than those who come down from
the theater. For they when they remove from thence are inflamed and burn
with desire. Having seen those women hovering  <span
id="fr_1625"></span>[1626](#fn_1625.md) on the stage, and received from
them ten thousand wounds, they will be in no better condition than a
tossing sea, when the image of the faces, the gestures, the speeches,
the walk, and all the rest, stand before their eyes and besiege their
soul. But they who come forth from a prison will suffer nothing of this
kind, but will enjoy great calm and tranquillity. For the compunction
arising from the sight of the prisoners, quenches all that fire. And if
a woman that is an harlot and a wanton meet a man coming forth from
among the prisoners, she will work him no mischief. For becoming for the
time to come, as it were, incapable of molding,  <span
id="fr_1626"></span>[1627](#fn_1626.md) he will thus not be taken by the
nets of her countenance, because instead of that wanton countenance
there will then be placed before his eyes the fear of the Judgment. On
this account, he who had gone over every kind of luxury said, “It is
better to go into the house of mourning than into the house of mirth.” (
[Eccl. vii. 2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#002.md) <span
id="iv.lxii-p46.11"></span> .) And so “here” thou wilt show forth great
wisdom, and “there” wilt hear those words which are worth ten thousand
blessings. Let us then not neglect such a practice and occupation. For
although we be not able to bring them food, nor to help them by giving
money, yet shall we be able to comfort them by our words, and to raise
up the drooping spirit, and to help them in many other ways by
conversing with those who cast them into prison, and by making their
keepers kinder, and we certainly shall effect either small or great
good. But if thou sayest that the men there are neither men of
condition,  <span id="fr_1627"></span>[1628](#fn_1627.md) nor good, nor
gentle, but man-slayers, tomb-breakers, cut-purses, adulterers,
intemperate, and full of many wickednesses, by this again thou showest
to me a pressing reason for spending time there. For we are not
commanded to take pity on the good and to punish the evil, but to
manifest this lovingkindness to all men. “Be ye,” It saith, “like to My
Father  <span id="fr_1628"></span>[1629](#fn_1628.md) which is in heaven,
for He maketh His sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth
rain on the just and on the unjust.” ( [Matt. v.
45](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#045) <span id="iv.lxii-p48.3"></span> ..md)
Do not then accuse other men’s faults bitterly, nor be a severe judge,
but mild and merciful. For we also, if we have not been adulterers, or
tomb-breakers, or cut-purses, yet have we other transgressions which
deserve infinite punishment. Perchance we have called our brother
“fool,” which prepares  <span id="fr_1629"></span>[1630](#fn_1629.md) for
us the pit; we have looked on women with unchastened eyes, which
constitutes absolute adultery; and what is more  <span
id="fr_1630"></span>[1631](#fn_1630.md) grievous than all, we partake not
worthily of the Mysteries, which maketh us guilty of the Body and Blood
of <span id="page_219">p. 219</span> <span id="iv.lxii-Page_219"></span>
Christ. Let us then not be bitter enquirers into the conduct of others,
but consider our own state, so shall we desist from this inhumanity and
cruelty. Besides this, it may be said that we shall there find many good
men, and often men worth as much as all the city. Since even that
prison-house in which Joseph was had in it many evil men, yet that just
man had the care of them all, and was, with the rest, concealed as to
his real character; for he was worth as much as all the land of Egypt,
yet still he dwelt in the prison-house, and no one knew him of those
that were within it. Thus also even now it is likely that there are
 <span id="fr_1631"></span>[1632](#fn_1631.md) many good and virtuous men,
though they be not visible to all men, and the care thou takest of such
as these gives thee a return for thy exertions in favor of the whole. Or
if there be none such, still even in this case great is thy recompense;
for thy Lord conversed not with the just only, while He avoided the
unclean, but received with kindness both the Canaanitish woman, and her
of Samaria, the abominable and impure; another also who was a harlot, on
whose account the Jews reproached Him, He both received and healed, and
allowed His feet to be washed by the tears of the polluted one, teaching
us to condescend to those that are in sin, for this most of all is
kindness. What sayest thou? Do robbers and tomb-breakers dwell in the
prison? And, tell me, are all they just men that dwell in the city? Nay,
are there not many worse even than these, robbing with greater
shamelessness? For the one sort, if there be no other excuse for them,
at least put before themselves the veil of solitude and darkness, and
the doing these things clandestinely; but the others throw away the mask
and go after their wickedness with uncovered head, being violent,
grasping, and covetous. Hard it is to find a man pure from injustice.

<span id="iv.lxii-p52"></span>\[6.\] If we do not take by violence gold,
or such and such a number of acres of land, yet we bring about the same
end by deceit and robbery in lesser matters, and where we are able to do
so. For when in making contracts, or when we must buy or sell anything,
we dispute and strive to pay less than the value, and use our utmost
endeavors to have it so, is not the action robbery? Is it not theft and
covetousness? Tell not me that thou hast not wrested away houses or
slaves, for injustice is judged not by the measure of the things taken,
but by the intention of those who commit the robbery. Since “just” and
“unjust” have the same force in great and in little things; and I call
cut-purses alike the man who cuts through a purse and takes the gold,
and him who buying from any of the market people deducts something from
the proper price; nor is he the only house-breaker who breaks through a
wall and steals anything within, but that man also who corrupts justice,
and takes anything from his neighbor.

<span id="iv.lxii-p53"></span>Let us not then pass by our own faults,
and become judges of other men’s; nor let us, when it is time for
lovingkindness, be searching out their wickedness; but considering what
our own state was once, let us now be gentle and kind. What then was our
state? Hear Paul say; “For we ourselves also were sometime foolish,
disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, hateful, and
hating one another” ( [Tit. iii. 3](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#003.md)
<span id="iv.lxii-p53.1"></span> ); and again, “We were by nature
children of wrath.” ( [Eph. ii. 3](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#003.md)
<span id="iv.lxii-p53.2"></span> .) But God seeing us as it were
confined in a prison-house, and bound with grievous chains, far more
grievous than those of iron, was not ashamed of us, but came and entered
the prison, and, though we deserved ten thousand punishments, both
brought us out from hence, and brought us to a kingdom, and made us more
glorious than the heaven, that we also might do the same according to
our power. For when He saith to His disciples, “If I, your Lord and
Master, have washed your feet, ye also ought to wash one another’s feet;
for I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to
you” ( [John 13.14](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#014.md)<span
id="iv.lxii-p53.3"></span> ), He writeth this law not merely for the
washing the feet, but also in all the other acts which He manifested
towards us. Is it a manslayer who inhabits the prison? Yet let not us be
weary in doing Him good. Is it a tomb-breaker, or an adulterer? Let us
pity not his wickedness, but his calamity. But often, as I before said,
one will be found there worth ten thousand; and if thou goest
continually to the prisoners, thou shalt not miss so great a prize. For
as Abraham, by entertaining even common guests, once met with Angels, so
shall we meet with great men too, if we make the action a business. And
if I may make a strange assertion, he who entertains a great man is not
so worthy of praise as he who receives the wretched and miserable. For
the former hath, in his own life, no slight occasion of being well
treated, but the other, rejected and given up by all, hath one only
harbor, the pity of his benefactor; so that this most of all is pure
kindness. He, moreover, who shows attention to an admired and
illustrious man, doth it often for ostentation among men, but he who
tends the abject and despairing, doth it only because of the command of
God. Wherefore, if we make a feast, we are bidden to entertain the lame
and halt, and if we do works of mercy, we are bidden to do them to the
least and meanest. “For,” It saith, “inasmuch as ye have done it unto
one of the least of these, ye have done it unto Me.” ( [Matt. xxv.
45](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#045) <span id="iv.lxii-p53.4"></span> ..md)
Knowing, therefore, the treasure which <span id="page_220">p. 220</span>
<span id="iv.lxii-Page_220"></span> is laid up in that place,  <span
id="fr_1632"></span>[1633](#fn_1632.md) let us enter continually, and make
it our business, and turn  <span id="fr_1633"></span>[1634](#fn_1633.md)
there our eager feelings about theaters. If thou hast nothing to
contribute, contribute the comfort of thy words. For God recompenseth
not only him that feedeth, but him also who goeth in. When thou enterest
and arouseth the trembling and fearful soul, exhorting, succoring,
promising assistance, teaching it true wisdom, thou shalt thence reap no
small reward. For if thou shouldest speak in such manner outside the
prison, many will even laugh, being dissipated  <span
id="fr_1634"></span>[1635](#fn_1634.md) by their excessive luxury: but
those who are in adversity, having their minds humbled, shall meekly
attend to thy words, and praise them, and become better men. Since even
when Paul preached, the Jews often derided him, but the prisoners
listened with much stillness. For nothing renders the soul so fit for
heavenly wisdom as calamity and temptation, and the pressure of
affliction. Considering all these things, and how much good we shall
work both to those within the prison, and to ourselves, by being
continually mixed  <span id="fr_1635"></span>[1636](#fn_1635.md) up with
them, let us there spend the time we used to spend in the market-place,
and in unseasonable occupations, that we may both win them and gladden
ourselves, and by causing God to be glorified, may obtain the
everlasting blessings, through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord
Jesus Christ, by whom and with whom, to the Father and the Holy Ghost,
be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
