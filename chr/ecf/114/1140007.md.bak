<span id="iv.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c15"><span
id="iv.iv-p1.1"></span>Homily II.</span>

<span id="iv.iv-p2"></span> [John i. 1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001.md)
<span id="iv.iv-p2.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iv-p3"></span>“In the beginning was the Word.”

<span id="iv.iv-p4"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.iv-p4.1"></span>Were</span> John about to converse with us, and
to say to us words of his own, we needs must describe his family, his
country, and his education. But since it is not he, but God by him, that
speaks to mankind, it seems to me superfluous and distracting to enquire
into these matters. And yet even thus it is not superfluous, but even
very necessary. For when you have learned who he was, and from whence,
who his parents, and what his character, and then hear his voice and all
his heavenly wisdom,  <span id="fr_16"></span>[17](#fn_16.md) then you
shall know right well that these (doctrines) belong not to him, but to
the Divine power stirring his soul.

<span id="iv.iv-p6"></span> From what country  <span
id="fr_17"></span>[18](#fn_17.md) then was he? From no country; but from a
poor village, and from a land little esteemed, and producing no good
thing. For the Scribes speak evil of Galilee, saying, “Search and look,
for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.” ( [John vii.
52](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#052) <span id="iv.iv-p7.2"></span> ..md)
And “the Israelite indeed” speaks ill of it, saying, “Can any good thing
come out of Nazareth?” And being of this land, he was not even of any
remarkable place in it, but of one not even distinguished by name. Of
this he was,  <span id="fr_18"></span>[19](#fn_18.md) and his father a poor
fisherman, so poor that he took his sons to the same employment. Now you
all know that no workman will choose to bring up his son to succeed him
in his trade, unless poverty press him very hard, especially where the
trade is a mean one. But nothing can be poorer, meaner, no, nor more
ignorant, than fishermen. Yet even among them there are some greater,
some less; and even there our Apostle occupied the lower rank, for he
did not take his prey from the sea, but passed his time on a certain
little lake. And as he was engaged by it with his father and his brother
James, and they mending their broken nets, a thing which of itself
marked extreme poverty, so Christ called him.  <span
id="fr_19"></span>[20](#fn_19.md)

<span id="iv.iv-p10"></span> As for worldly instruction, we may learn
from these facts that he had none at all of it. Besides, Luke testifies
this when he writes not only that he was ignorant,  <span
id="fr_20"></span>[21](#fn_20.md) but that he was absolutely <span
id="page_5">p. 5</span> <span id="iv.iv-Page_5"></span> unlettered.
 <span id="fr_21"></span>[22](#fn_21.md) ( [Acts iv.
13](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#013) <span id="iv.iv-p12.3"></span> ..md)
As was likely. For one who was so poor, never coming into the public
assemblies, nor falling in with men of respectability, but as it were
nailed to his fishing, or even if he ever did meet any one, conversing
with fishmongers and cooks, how, I say, was he likely to be in a state
better than that of the irrational animals? how could he help imitating
the very dumbness of his fishes?

<span id="iv.iv-p13"></span> \[2.\] This fisherman then, whose business
was about lakes, and nets, and fish; this native of Bethsaida of
Galilee; this son of a poor fisherman, yes, and poor to the last degree;
this man ignorant, and to the last degree of ignorance too, who never
learned letters either before or after he accompanied Christ; let us see
what he utters, and on what matters he converses with us. Is it of
things in the field? Is it of things in rivers? On the trade in fish? 
For these things, perhaps, one expects to hear from a fisherman. But
fear ye not; we shall hear nought of these; but we shall hear of things
in heaven, and what no one ever learned before this man. For, as might
be expected of one who speaks from the very treasures of the Spirit, he
is come bringing to us sublime doctrines, and the best way of life and
wisdom, \[as though just arrived from the very heavens; yea, rather such
as it was not likely that all even there should know, as I said before.
 <span id="fr_22"></span>[23](#fn_22.md) \] Do these things belong to a
fisherman? Tell me. Do they belong to a rhetorician at all? To a sophist
or philosopher? To every one trained in the wisdom of the Gentiles? By
no means. The human soul is simply unable thus to philosophize on that
pure and blessed nature; on the powers that come next to it; on
immortality and endless life; on the nature of mortal bodies which shall
hereafter be immortal; on punishment and the judgment to come; on the
enquiries that shall be as to deeds and words, as to thoughts and
imaginations. It cannot tell what is man, what the world; what is man
indeed, and what he who seems to be man, but is not; what is the nature
of virtue, what of vice.

<span id="iv.iv-p15"></span> \[3.\] Some of these things indeed the
disciples of Plato and Pythagoras enquired into. Of the other
philosophers we need make no mention at all; they have all on this point
been so excessively ridiculous; and those who have been among them in
greater esteem than the rest, and who have been considered the leading
men in this science, are so more than the others; and they have composed
and written somewhat on the subject of polity and doctrines, and in all
have been more shamefully ridiculous than children. For they have spent
their whole life in making women common to all, in overthrowing the very
order of life,  <span id="fr_23"></span>[24](#fn_23.md) in doing away the
honor of marriage, and in making other the like ridiculous laws. As for
doctrines on the soul, there is nothing excessively shameful that they
have left unsaid; asserting that the souls of men become flies, and
gnats, and bushes,  <span id="fr_24"></span>[25](#fn_24.md) and that God
Himself is a soul; with some other the like indecencies.

<span id="iv.iv-p20"></span>And not this alone in them is worthy of
blame, but so is also their ever-shifting current of words; for since
they assert everything on uncertain and fallacious arguments, they are
like men carried hither and thither in Euripus, and never remain in the
same place.

<span id="iv.iv-p21"></span> Not so this fisherman; for all he saith is
infallible; and standing as it were upon a rock, he never shifts his
ground. For since he has been thought worthy to be in the most secret
places, and has the Lord of all speaking within him, he is subject to
nothing that is human. But they, like persons who are not held worthy
even in a dream  <span id="fr_25"></span>[26](#fn_25.md) to set foot in the
king’s palace, but who pass their time in the forum with other men,
guessing from their own imagination at what they cannot see, have erred
a great error, and, like blind or drunken men in their wandering, have
dashed against each other; and not only against each other, but against
themselves, by continually changing their opinion, and that ever on the
same matters.

<span id="iv.iv-p23"></span> \[4.\] But this unlettered man, the
ignorant, the native of Bethsaida, the son of Zebedee, (though the
Greeks mock ten thousand times at the rusticity of the names, I shall
not the less speak them with the greater boldness.) For the more
barbarous his nation seems to them, and the more he seems removed from
Grecian discipline, so much the brighter does what we have with us
appear. For when a barbarian and an untaught person utters things which
no man on earth ever knew, and does not only utter, (though if this were
the only thing it were a great marvel,) but besides this, affords
another and a stronger proof that what he says is divinely inspired,
namely, the convincing all his hearers through all time; who will not
wonder at the power that dwells in him? Since this is, as I said, the
strongest proof that he lays down no laws of his own. This barbarian
then, with his writing of the Gospel, has occupied all the habitable
world. With his body he has taken possession of the center of Asia,
where of old philosophized all of the Grecian party, shining forth in
the midst of his foes, dispersing  <span id="fr_26"></span>[27](#fn_26.md)
their darkness, and breaking down the stronghold of <span id="page_6">p.
6</span> <span id="iv.iv-Page_6"></span> devils: but in soul he has
retired to that place which is fit for one who has done such things.

<span id="iv.iv-p25"></span> \[5.\] And as for the writings of the
Greeks, they are all put out and vanished, but this man’s shine brighter
day by day. For from the time that he (was) and the other fishermen,
since then the (doctrines) of Pythagoras and of Plato, which seemed
before to prevail, have ceased to be spoken of, and most men do not know
them even by name. Yet Plato was, they say, the invited companion of
kings, had many friends, and sailed to Sicily. And Pythagoras occupied
Magna Græcia,  <span id="fr_27"></span>[28](#fn_27.md) and practiced there
ten thousand kinds of sorcery. For to converse with oxen, (which they
say he did,) was nothing else but a piece of sorcery. As is most clear
from this. He that so conversed with brutes did not in anything benefit
the race of men, but even did them the greatest wrong. Yet surely, the
nature of men was better adapted for the reasoning of philosophy; still
he did, as they say, converse with eagles and oxen, using sorceries. For
he did not make their irrational nature rational, (this was impossible
to man,) but by his magic tricks he deceived the foolish. And neglecting
to teach men anything useful, he taught that they might as well eat the
heads of those who begot them, as beans. And he persuaded those who
associated with him, that the soul of their teacher had actually been at
one time a bush, at another a girl, at another a fish.

<span id="iv.iv-p27"></span>Are not these things with good cause
extinct, and vanished utterly? With good cause, and reasonably. But not
so the words of him who was ignorant and unlettered; for Syrians, and
Egyptians, and Indians, and Persians, and Ethiopians, and ten thousand
other nations, translating into their own tongues the doctrines
introduced by him, barbarians though they be, have learned to
philosophize. I did not therefore idly say that all the world has become
his theater. For he did not leave those of his own kind, and waste his
labor on the irrational creatures, (an act of excessive vainglory and
extreme folly,) but being clear of this as well as of other passions, he
was earnest on one point only, that all the world might learn somewhat
of the things which might profit it, and be able to translate it from
earth to heaven.

<span id="iv.iv-p28"></span> For this reason too, he did not hide his
teaching in mist and darkness, as they did who threw obscurity of
speech, like a kind of veil, around the mischiefs laid up within. But
this man’s doctrines are clearer than the sunbeams, wherefore they have
been unfolded  <span id="fr_28"></span>[29](#fn_28.md) to all men
throughout the world. For he did not teach as Pythagoras did, commanding
those who came to him to be silent for five years, or to sit like
senseless stones; neither did he invent fables defining the universe to
consist of numbers; but casting away all this devilish trash and
mischief, he diffused such simplicity through his words, that all he
said was plain, not only to wise men, but also to women and youths. For
he was persuaded that the words were true and profitable to all that
should hearken to them. And all time after him is his witness; since he
has drawn to him all the world, and has freed our life when we have
listened to these words from all monstrous display of wisdom; wherefore
we who hear them would prefer rather to give up our lives, than the
doctrines by him delivered to us.

<span id="iv.iv-p30"></span> \[6.\] From this then, and from every other
circumstance, it is plain, that nothing of this man’s is human, but
divine and heavenly are the lessons which come to us by this divine
soul. For we shall observe not sounding sentences, nor magnificent
diction, nor excessive and useless order and arrangement of words and
sentences, (these things are far from all true wisdom,) but strength
invincible and divine, and irresistible force of right doctrines, and a
rich supply of unnumbered good things. For their over-care about
expression was so excessive, so worthy of mere sophists, or rather not
even of sophists, but of silly striplings, that even their own chief
philosopher introduces his own master as greatly ashamed of this art,
and as saying to the judges, that what they hear from him shall be
spoken plainly and without premeditation, not tricked out rhetorically
nor ornamented with (fine) sentences and words; since, says he, it
cannot surely be becoming, O men, that one at my age should come before
you like a lad inventing speeches.  <span id="fr_29"></span>[30](#fn_29.md)
And observe the extreme absurdity of the thing; what he has described
his master avoiding as disgraceful, unworthy of philosophy and work for
lads, this above all he himself has cultivated. So entirely were they
given up to mere love of distinction.

<span id="iv.iv-p32"></span>And as, if you uncover those sepulchers
which are whitened without you will find them full of corruption, and
stench, and rotten bones; so too the doctrines of the philosopher, if
you strip them of their flowery diction, you will see to be full of much
abomination, especially when he philosophizes on the soul, which he both
honors and speaks ill of without measure. And this is the snare of the
devil, never to keep due proportion, but by excess on either hand to
lead aside those who are entangled by it into evil speaking. At one time
he says, that the soul is of the substance of God; at another, after
having exalted it thus immoderately and impiously, he exceeds again in a
different way, and treats it <span id="page_7">p. 7</span> <span
id="iv.iv-Page_7"></span> with insult, making it pass into swine and
asses, and other animals of yet less esteem than these.

<span id="iv.iv-p33"></span>But enough of this; or rather even this is
out of measure. For if it were possible to learn anything profitable
from these things, we must have been longer occupied with them; but if
it be only to observe their indecency and absurdity, more than requisite
has been said by us already. We will therefore leave their fables, and
attach ourselves to our own doctrines, which have been brought to us
from above by the tongue of this fisherman, and which have nothing human
in them.

<span id="iv.iv-p34"></span>\[7.\] Let us then bring forward the words,
having reminded you now, as I exhorted you at the first, earnestly to
attend to what is said. What then does this Evangelist say immediately
on his outset?

<span id="iv.iv-p35"></span>“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word
was with God.” ( [John 1.1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001.md)<span
id="iv.iv-p35.1"></span> .) Seest thou the great boldness and power of
the words, how he speaks nothing doubting nor conjecturing, but
declaring all things plainly? For this is the teacher’s part, not to
waver in anything he says, since if he who is to be a guide to the rest
require another person who shall be able to establish him with
certainty, he would be rightly ranked not among teachers, but among
disciples.

<span id="iv.iv-p36"></span>But if any one say, “What can be the reason
that he has neglected the first cause, and spoken to us at once
concerning the second?” we shall decline to speak of “first” and
“second,” for the Divinity is above number, and the succession of times.
Wherefore we decline these expressions; but we confess that the Father
is from none, and that the Son is begotten of the Father. Yes, it may be
said, but why then does he leave the Father, and speak concerning the
Son? Why? because the former was manifest to all, if not as Father, at
least as God; but the Only-Begotten was not known; and therefore with
reason did he immediately from the very beginning hasten to implant the
knowledge of Him in those who knew Him not.

<span id="iv.iv-p37"></span>Besides, he has not been silent as to the
Father in his writings on these points. And observe, I beg of you, his
spiritual wisdom. He knows that men most honor the eldest of beings
which was before all, and account this to be God. Wherefore from this
point first he makes his beginning, and as he advances, declares that
God is, and does not like Plato assert, sometimes that He is intellect,
sometimes that He is soul; for these things are far removed from that
divine and unmixed Nature which has nothing common with us, but is
separated from any fellowship with created things, I mean as to
substance, though not as to relation.

<span id="iv.iv-p38"></span>And for this reason he calls Him “The Word.”
For since he is about to teach that this “Word” is the only-begotten Son
of God, in order that no one may imagine that His generation is
passible, by giving Him the appellation of “The Word,” he anticipates
and removes beforehand the evil suspicion, showing that the Son is from
the Father, and that without His suffering (change).

<span id="iv.iv-p39"></span>\[8.\] Seest thou then that as I said, he
has not been silent as to the Father in his words concerning the Son?
And if these instances are not sufficient fully to explain the whole
matter, marvel not, for our argument is God, whom it is impossible to
describe, or to imagine worthily; hence this man nowhere assigns the
name of His essence, (for it is not possible to say what God is, as to
essence,) but everywhere he declares Him to us by His workings. For this
“Word” one may see shortly after called “Light,” and the “Light” in turn
named “Life.”

<span id="iv.iv-p40"></span>Although not for this reason only did he so
name Him; this was the first reason, and the second was because He was
about to declare to us the things of the Father. For “all things,” He
saith, “that I have heard from my Father, I have made known unto you.” (
[John xv. 15](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#015.md) <span
id="iv.iv-p40.1"></span> .) He calls Him both “Light” and “Life,” for He
hath freely given to us the light which proceeds from knowledge, and the
life which follows it. In short, one name is not sufficient, nor two,
nor three, nor more, to teach us what belongs to God. But we must be
content to be able even by means of many to apprehend, though but
obscurely, His attributes.

<span id="iv.iv-p41"></span>And he has not called Him simply “Word,” but
with the addition of the article, distinguishing Him from the rest in
this way also. Seest thou then that I said not without cause that this
Evangelist speaks to us from heaven? Only see from the very beginning
whither he has drawn up the soul, having given it wings, and has carried
up with him the mind of his hearers. For having set it higher than all
the things of sense, than earth, than sea, than heaven, he leads it by
the hand above the very angels, above cherubim and seraphim, above
thrones and principalities and powers; in a word, persuades it to
journey beyond all created things.

<span id="iv.iv-p42"></span> \[9.\] What then? when he has brought us to
such a height as this, is he in sooth able to stop us there? By no
means; but just as one by transporting into the midst of the sea a
person who was standing on the beach, and looking on cities, and
beaches, and havens, removes him indeed from the former objects, yet
does not stay his sight anywhere, but brings him to a view without
bound; so this Evangelist, having brought us above all creation, and
escorted us towards the eternal periods which lie beyond it, leaves the
sight suspended,  <span id="fr_30"></span>[31](#fn_30.md) not allowing it
to <span id="page_8">p. 8</span> <span id="iv.iv-Page_8"></span> arrive
at any limit upwards, as indeed there is none.

<span id="iv.iv-p44"></span>For the intellect, having ascended to “the
beginning,” enquires what “beginning”; and then finding the “was” always
outstripping its imagination, has no point at which to stay its thought;
but looking intently onwards, and being unable to cease at any point, it
becomes wearied out, and turns back to things below. For this “was in
the beginning,” is nothing else than expressive of ever being and being
infinitely.

<span id="iv.iv-p45"></span>Seest thou true philosophy and divine
doctrines? Not like those of the Greeks, who assign times, and say that
some indeed of the gods are younger, some elder. There is nothing of
this with us. For if God Is, as certainly He Is, then nothing was before
Him. If He is Creator of all things, He must be first; if Master and
Lord of all, then all, both creatures and ages, are after Him.

<span id="iv.iv-p46"></span> \[10.\] I had desired to enter the lists
yet on other difficulties, but perhaps our minds are wearied out; when
therefore I have advised you on those points which are useful  <span
id="fr_31"></span>[32](#fn_31.md) to us for the hearing, both of what has
been said, and of what is yet to be said, I again will hold my peace.
What then are these points? I know that many have become confused  <span
id="fr_32"></span>[33](#fn_32.md) by reason of the length of what has been
spoken. Now this takes place when the soul is heavy laden with many
burdens of this life. For as the eye when it is clear and transparent is
keen-sighted also, and will not easily be tired in making out even the
minutest bodies; but when from some bad humor from the head having
poured into it, or some smoke-like fumes having ascended to it from
beneath, a kind of thick cloud is formed before the ball, this does not
allow it clearly to perceive even any larger object; so is naturally the
case with the soul. For when it is purified, and has no passion to
disturb it, it looks steadfastly to the fit objects of its regard; but
when, darkened by many passions, it loses its proper excellence, then it
is not easily able to be sufficient for any high thing, but soon is
wearied, and falls back; and turning aside to sleep and sloth, lets pass
things that concern it with a view to excellence and the life thence
arising, instead of receiving them with much readiness.

<span id="iv.iv-p49"></span>And that you may not suffer this, (I shall
not cease continually thus to warn you,) strengthen your minds, that ye
may not hear what the faithful among the Hebrews heard from Paul. For to
them he said that he had “many things to say, and hard to be uttered” (
[Heb. v. 11](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#011.md) <span
id="iv.iv-p49.1"></span> ); not as though they were by nature such, but
because, says he, “ye are dull of hearing.” For it is the nature of the
weak and infirm man to be confused even by few words as by many, and
what is clear and easy he thinks hard to be comprehended. Let not any
here be such an one, but having chased from him all worldly care, so let
him hear these doctrines.

<span id="iv.iv-p50"></span>For when the desire of money possesses the
hearer, the desire of hearing cannot possess him as well; since the
soul, being one, cannot suffice for many desires; but one of the two is
injured by the other, and, from division, becomes weaker as its rival
prevails, and expends all upon itself.

<span id="iv.iv-p51"></span>And this is wont to happen in the case of
children. When a man has only one, he loves that one exceedingly. But
when he has become father of many, then also his dispositions of
affection being divided become weaker.

<span id="iv.iv-p52"></span>If this happens where there is the absolute
rule and power of nature, and the objects beloved are akin one with
another, what can we say as to that desire and disposition which is
according to deliberate choice; especially where these desires lie
directly opposed to each other; for the love of wealth is a thing
opposed to the love of this kind of hearing. We enter heaven when we
enter here; not in place, I mean, but in disposition; for it is possible
for one who is on earth to stand in heaven, and to have vision of the
things that are there, and to hear the words from thence.

<span id="iv.iv-p53"></span> \[11.\] Let none then introduce the things
of earth into heaven; let no one standing here be careful about what is
at his house. For he ought to bear with him, and to preserve both at
home and in his business, what he gains from this place, not to allow it
to be loaded with the burdens of house and market. Our reason for
entering in to the chair of instruction is, that thence we may cleanse
ourselves from  <span id="fr_33"></span>[34](#fn_33.md) the filth of the
outer world; but if we are likely even in this little space to be
injured by things said or done without, it is better for us not to enter
at all. Let no one then in the assembly be thinking about domestic
matters, but let him at home be stirring with what he heard in the
assembly. Let these things be more precious to us than any. These
concern the soul, but those the body; or rather what is said here
concerns both body and soul. Wherefore let these things be our leading
business, and all others but occasional employments; for these belong
both to the future and the present life, but the rest neither to the one
nor the other, unless they be managed according to the law laid down for
these. Since from these it is impossible to learn not only what we shall
hereafter be, and how we <span id="page_9">p. 9</span> <span
id="iv.iv-Page_9"></span> shall then live, but how we shall rightly
direct this present life also.

<span id="iv.iv-p55"></span> For this house is  <span
id="fr_34"></span>[35](#fn_34.md) a spiritual surgery, that whatever wounds
we may have received without, here  <span id="fr_35"></span>[36](#fn_35.md)
we may heal, not that we may gather fresh ones to take with us hence.
Yet if we do not give heed to the Spirit speaking to us, we shall not
only fail to clear ourselves of our former hurts, but shall get others
in addition.

<span id="iv.iv-p58"></span> Let us then with much earnestness attend to
the book as it is being unfolded to us; since if we learn exactly its
first principles and fundamental doctrines,  <span
id="fr_36"></span>[37](#fn_36.md) we shall not afterwards require much
close study, but after laboring a little at the beginning, shall be
able, as Paul says, to instruct others also. ( [Rom. xv.
14](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#014) <span id="iv.iv-p59.3"></span> ..md)
For this Apostle is very sublime, abounding in many doctrines, and on
these he dwells more than on other matters.

<span id="iv.iv-p60"></span>Let us not then be careless hearers. And
this is the reason why we set them forth to you by little and little, so
that all may be easily intelligible to you, and may not escape your
memory. Let us fear then lest we come under the condemnation of that
word which says, “If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not
had sin.” ( [John xv. 22](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#022.md) <span
id="iv.iv-p60.1"></span> .) For what shall we be profited more than
those who have not heard, if even after hearing we go our way home
bearing nothing with us, but only wondering at what has been said.

<span id="iv.iv-p61"></span>Allow us then to sow in good ground; allow
us, that you may draw us the more to you. If any man hath thorns, let
him cast the fire of the Spirit amongst them. If any hath a hard and
stubborn heart, let him by employing the same fire make it soft and
yielding. If any by the wayside is trodden down by all kind of thoughts,
let him enter into more sheltered places, and not lie exposed for those
that will to invade for plunder: that so we may see your cornfields
waving with corn. Besides, if we exercise such care as this over
ourselves, and apply ourselves industriously to this spiritual hearing,
if not at once yet by degrees, we shall surely be freed from all the
cares of life.

<span id="iv.iv-p62"></span> Let us therefore take heed that it be not
said of us, that our  <span id="fr_37"></span>[38](#fn_37.md) ears are
those of a deaf adder. ( [Ps. lviii. 4](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#004.md)
<span id="iv.iv-p63.1"></span> .) For tell me, in what does a hearer of
this kind differ from a beast? and how could he be otherwise than more
irrational than any irrational animal, who does not attend when God is
speaking? And if to be well-pleasing  <span
id="fr_38"></span>[39](#fn_38.md) to God is really to be a man, what else
but a beast can he be who will not even hear how he may succeed in this?
Consider then what a misfortune it would be for us to fall down  <span
id="fr_39"></span>[40](#fn_39) of our own accord from (the nature of.md)
men to (that of) beasts, when Christ is willing of men to make us equal
to angels. For to serve the belly, to be possessed by the desire of
riches, to be given to anger, to bite, to kick, become not men, but
beasts. Nay, even the beasts have each, as one may say, one single
passion, and that by nature. But man, when he has cast away the dominion
of reason, and torn himself from the commonwealth of God’s devising,
gives himself up to all the passions, is no longer merely a beast, but a
kind of many-formed motley monster; nor has he even the excuse from
nature, for all his wickedness proceeds from deliberate choice and
determination.

<span id="iv.iv-p66"></span>May we never have cause to suspect this of
the Church of Christ. Indeed, we are concerning you persuaded of better
things, and such as belong to salvation; but the more we are so
persuaded, the more careful we will be not to desist from words of
caution. In order that having mounted to the summit of excellencies, we
may obtain the promised goods. Which may it come to pass that we all
attain to, through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus
Christ, by whom and with whom, to the Father and the Holy Ghost, be
glory world without end. Amen.
