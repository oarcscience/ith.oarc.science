<span id="iv.xlvi-p1"></span> <span class="c15"><span
id="iv.xlvi-p1.1"></span>Homily XLIV.</span>

<span id="iv.xlvi-p2"></span> <span id="iv.xlvi-p2.1"></span> <span
class="c1"><span id="iv.xlvi-p2.2"></span>[John
6:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#026.md),
[27](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#027.md)<span
id="iv.xlvi-p2.3"></span></span>

<span id="iv.xlvi-p3"></span>“Jesus answered them, and said, Verily,
verily, I say unto you, Ye seek Me, not because ye saw the miracles but
because ye did eat of the loaves and were filled. Labor not for the meat
which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting
life.”

<span id="iv.xlvi-p4"></span> \[1.\] <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.xlvi-p4.1"></span>The</span> mild and gentle is not always
useful, but there are times when the teacher needs sharper language. For
if the disciple be dull and gross, then, in order to touch his dullness
to the quick, we must rouse him with  <span
id="fr_1240"></span>[1241](#fn_1240.md) a goad. And this the Son of God
hath done in the present as well as in many other cases. For when the
crowds had come and found Jesus, and were flattering Him, and saying,
“Master, when camest Thou hither?” to show that He desireth not honor
from men, but looketh to one thing only, their salvation, He answereth
them sharply, wishing to correct them not in this way only, but also by
revealing and exposing their thoughts. For what saith He? “Verily,
verily, I say unto you,” (speaking positively and with a confirmation,)
“Ye seek Me, not because ye saw miracles, but because ye did eat of the
loaves and were filled.” He chideth and reproveth them by these words,
yet doth not so abruptly or violently, but very sparingly. For He saith
not, “O ye gluttons and belly-slaves, I have wrought so many wonders,
and ye never have either followed Me, or marveled at My doings”; but
mildly and gently somewhat in this manner; “Ye seek Me, not because ye
saw miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves and were filled”;
speaking not only of the past, but also of the present miracle. “It was
not,” He saith, “the miracle of the loaves that astonished you, but the
being filled.”  <span id="fr_1241"></span>[1242](#fn_1241.md) And that He
said not this of them by conjecture they straightway showed, for on this
account they came the second time, as being about to enjoy the same
(food) as before. Wherefore they said, “Our fathers did eat manna in the
wilderness.” Again they draw Him to (the subject of) carnal food, which
was the chief accusation and charge against them. But He stoppeth not at
rebukes, but addeth instruction also, saying, “Labor not for the meat
which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting
life.”

<span id="iv.xlvi-p7"></span> “Which the Son of Man giveth  <span
id="fr_1242"></span>[1243](#fn_1242.md) unto you; for Him hath God the
Father sealed.”

<span id="iv.xlvi-p9"></span> <span id="page_156">p. 156</span> <span
id="iv.xlvi-Page_156"></span> What He saith, is of this kind: “Make ye
no account of this earthly, but of that spiritual food.” But since some
of those who desire to live in doing nothing have abused this speech, as
though Christ would entirely abolish working, it is seasonable to say
somewhat to them. For they slander, so to speak, all Christianity, and
cause it to be ridiculed on the score of idleness. First however, we
must mention that saying of Paul. What saith he?  “Remember the Lord,
how He said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.” ( [Acts xx.
35](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#035) <span id="iv.xlvi-p9.1"></span> ..md)
Now how can it be possible for him to give who hath not? How then saith
Jesus to Martha, “Thou art careful and troubled about many things, but
one thing is needful, and Mary hath chosen that good part”? ( [Luke
10:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#041.md),
[42](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#042)<span id="iv.xlvi-p9.2"></span> .md);
and again, “Take no thought for the morrow.” ( [Matt. vi.
34](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#034) <span id="iv.xlvi-p9.3"></span> ..md)
For it is necessary now to resolve all these questions, not only that we
may check men if they would be idle, but also that the oracles of God
may not appear to bring in what is contradictory.

<span id="iv.xlvi-p10"></span>Now Paul in another place saith, “But we
beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more and more, that ye study to
be quiet, and to do your own business; that ye may walk honestly toward
them that are without” ( [1 Thess.
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#010.md),
[11](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#011.md),
[12](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#012)<span id="iv.xlvi-p10.1"></span> .md);
and again; “Let him that stole, steal no more; but rather let him labor,
working with his own hands, that he may have to give to him that
needeth.” ( [Eph. iv. 28](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#028.md) <span
id="iv.xlvi-p10.2"></span> .) Here the Apostle bids not simply “work,”
but to work so vigorously and laboriously, as to have thereby somewhat
to give to others. And in another place the same saith again; “These
hands have ministered to my necessities, and to them that were with me.”
( [Acts xx. 34](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#034.md) <span
id="iv.xlvi-p10.3"></span> .) And writing to the Corinthians he said,
“What is my reward then? Verily, that when I preach the Gospel, I may
make the Gospel of Christ without charge.” ( [1 Cor. ix.
18](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#018) <span id="iv.xlvi-p10.4"></span> ..md)
And when he was in that city, he abode with Aquila and Priscilla, “and
wrought, for by their occupation they were tentmakers.” ( [Acts xviii.
3](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#003) <span id="iv.xlvi-p10.5"></span> ..md)

<span id="iv.xlvi-p11"></span> These passages show a yet more decided
opposition as to the letter;  <span id="fr_1243"></span>[1244](#fn_1243.md)
we must therefore now bring forward the solution. What then must be our
reply? That to “take no thought,” doth not mean “not to work,” but “not
to be nailed to the things of this life”; that is, to take no care for
to-morrow’s ease, but to deem that superfluous. For a man may do no
work, and (yet) lay up treasure for the morrow; and a man may work, yet
be careful for nothing; for carefulness and work are not the same thing;
it is not as trusting to his work that a man worketh, but, “that he may
impart to him that needeth.” And that too which was said to Martha
refers not to works and working, but to this, that it is our duty to
know the right season, and not to spend on carnal things the time proper
for listening. Thus Christ spake not the words as urging her to
“idleness,” but to rivet her to listening. “I came,” saith He, “to teach
you needful things, but thou art anxious about a meal. Dost thou desire
to receive Me, and to provide for Me a costly table? Provide another
sort of entertainment, by giving me a ready hearing, and by imitating
thy sister’s longing for instruction.” He said not this to forbid her
hospitality, (away with the thought! how could that be?) but to show
that she ought not in the season for listening be busy about other
matters. For to say, “Labor not for the meat that perisheth,” is not the
expression of one implying that we ought to be idle; (in fact, this most
especially is “meat that perisheth,” for idleness is wont to teach all
wickedness;) but that we ought to work, and to impart. This is meat that
never perisheth; but if any be idle and gluttonous, and careth for
luxury, that man worketh for “the meat that perisheth.” So too, if a man
by his labor should feed Christ, and give Him drink, and clothe Him, who
 <span id="fr_1244"></span>[1245](#fn_1244.md) so senseless and mad  <span
id="fr_1245"></span>[1246](#fn_1245.md) as to say that such an one labors
for the meat that perisheth, when there is for this the promise of the
kingdom that is to come, and of those good things? This meat endureth
forever. But at that time, since the multitudes made no account of
filth, nor sought to learn who it was that did these things, and by what
power, but desired one thing only, to fill their bellies without
working; Christ with good reason called such food, “meat that
perisheth.” “I fed,” He saith, “your bodies, that after this ye might
seek that other food which endureth, which nourisheth the soul; but ye
again run  <span id="fr_1246"></span>[1247](#fn_1246.md) after that which
is earthy. Therefore ye do not understand that I lead you not to this
imperfect food, but to that which giveth not temporal but eternal life,
which nourisheth not the body but the soul.” Then when He had uttered
such great words concerning Himself, and had said that He would give
this food, in order that what was spoken might not stand in their way,
to make His saying credible He attributeth the supply to the Father. For
after saying, “Which the Son of Man shall give you”; He addeth, “Him
hath God the Father sealed,” that is, “hath sent Him for this purpose,
that He might bring the food to you.” The saying also admits of another
interpretation; for in another place Christ saith, “He that heareth My
words, hath set to his seal that God is true” ( [John
3.33](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#033.md)<span id="iv.xlvi-p15.3"></span>
), that is, hath “showed forth undeniably.” Which indeed the expression
seems to me to hint at even in this place, for <span id="page_157">p.
157</span> <span id="iv.xlvi-Page_157"></span> “the Father hath sealed,”
is nothing else than “hath declared,” “hath revealed by His testimony.”
He in fact declared Himself too, but since He was speaking to Jews, He
brought forward the testimony of the Father.

<span id="iv.xlvi-p16"></span> \[2.\] Learn we then, beloved, to ask of
God the things which it is meet for us to ask of Him. For those other
things, those, I mean, which belong to this life, whichever way they may
fall out, can do us no injury; for if we be rich, it is here only that
we shall enjoy our luxury; and if we fall into poverty, we shall suffer
nothing terrible. For neither the splendors nor the pains of the present
life have much power in respect either of despondency or pleasure, they
are contemptible, and slip away very swiftly. Wherefore they are called
“a way,” with reason, because they pass away, and by their very nature
do not long endure,  <span id="fr_1247"></span>[1248](#fn_1247.md) but the
things which are to come endure eternally, both those of punishment and
those of the Kingdom. Let us then in regard of these things use much
diligence to avoid the first and to choose the last. For what is the
advantage of this world’s luxury? To-day it is, and to-morrow it is not;
to-day a bright flower, to-morrow scattered dust; to-day a burning fire,
to-morrow smouldering ashes. But spiritual things are not so, they ever
remain shining and blooming, and becoming brighter every day. That
wealth never perishes,  <span id="fr_1248"></span>[1249](#fn_1248.md) never
departs, never ceases, never brings with it care or envy or blame,
destroys not the body, corrupts not the soul, is without ill will, heaps
not up malice; all which things attend on the other kind of wealth. That
honor lifts not men into folly, doth not make them puffed up, never
ceases nor is dimmed. Again, the rest and delight of heaven endureth
continually, ever being immovable and immortal, one cannot find its end
or limit. This life then let us desire, for if we do so we shall make no
account of present things, but shall despise and mock at them all, and
though one should bid us enter into kingly halls, we shall not while we
have this hope choose to do so; yet nothing (earthly) seems more near to
happiness than such a permission; but to those who are possessed by love
of heaven, even this seems little and mean, and worthy of no account.
Nothing which comes to an end is to be much desired; whatever ceases,
and to-day is and tomorrow is not, even though it be very great, yet
seems to be very little and contemptible. Then let us not cling to
fleeting things which slip away and depart, but to those which are
enduring and immovable. To which may we all attain,  <span
id="fr_1249"></span>[1250](#fn_1249.md) through the grace and
lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom and with whom, to the
Father and the Holy Ghost, be glory, now and ever and world without end.
Amen.
