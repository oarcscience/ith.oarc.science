<span id="v.xxxviii-p2"></span> <span id="v.xxxviii-p2.1"></span> <span
class="c1"><span id="v.xxxviii-p2.2"></span>[Hebrews xiii.
17](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#017.md)<span
id="v.xxxviii-p2.3"></span></span>

<span id="v.xxxviii-p3"></span> *“Obey them that have the rule over you,
and submit yourselves. For they watch for your souls, as they that must
give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief,*  <span
id="fr_3494"></span>[3495](#fn_3494.md) *for this is unprofitable for
you.”*

<span id="v.xxxviii-p5"></span> \[1.\] <span class="c11"><span
id="v.xxxviii-p5.1"></span>Anarchy  <span
id="fr_3495"></span>[3496](#fn_3495.md) </span> is an evil, and the
occasion of many calamities, and the source of disorder and confusion.
For as, if thou take away the leader from a chorus, the chorus will not
be in tune and in order; and if from a phalanx of an army thou remove
the commander, the evolutions will no longer be made in time and order,
and if from a ship thou take away the helmsman, thou wilt sink the
vessel; so too if from a flock thou remove the shepherd, thou hast
overthrown and destroyed all.

<span id="v.xxxviii-p7"></span>Anarchy then is an evil, and a cause of
ruin. But no less an evil also is the disobedience to rulers. For it
comes again to the same. For a people not obeying a ruler, is like one
which has none; and perhaps even worse. For in the former case they have
at least an excuse for disorder, but no longer in the latter, but are
punished.

<span id="v.xxxviii-p8"></span> But perhaps some one will say, there is
also a third evil, when the ruler is bad. I myself too know it, and no
small evil it is, but even a far worse evil than anarchy. For it is
better to be led by no one, than to be led by one who is evil. For the
former indeed are oftentimes saved, and oftentimes are in peril,  <span
id="fr_3496"></span>[3497](#fn_3496.md) but the latter <span
id="page_519">p. 519</span> <span id="v.xxxviii-Page_519"></span> will
be altogether in peril, being led into the pit \[of destruction\].

<span id="v.xxxviii-p10"></span>How then does Paul say, “Obey them that
have the rule over you, and submit yourselves”? Having said above,
“whose faith follow, considering the end of their conversation” ( [Heb.
13.7](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#007.md)<span id="v.xxxviii-p10.1"></span>
), he then said, “Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit
yourselves.”

<span id="v.xxxviii-p11"></span>What then (you say), when he is wicked
should we obey?

<span id="v.xxxviii-p12"></span>Wicked? In what sense? If indeed in
regard to Faith, flee and avoid him; not only if he be a man, but even
if he be an angel come down from Heaven; but if in regard to life, be
not over-curious. And this instance I do not allege from my own mind,
but from the Divine Scripture. For hear Christ saying, “The Scribes and
the Pharisees sit on Moses’ seat.” ( [Matt. xxiii.
2](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#002.md) <span id="v.xxxviii-p12.1"></span>
.) Having previously spoken many fearful things concerning them, He then
says, “They sit on Moses’ seat: all therefore whatsoever they tell you
observe, do; but do not ye after their works.” ( [Matt.
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#002.md),
[3](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#003.md)<span id="v.xxxviii-p12.2"></span>
.) They have (He means) the dignity of office, but are of unclean life.
Do thou however attend, not to their life, but to their words. For as
regards their characters, no one would be harmed \[thereby\]. How is
this? Both because their characters are manifest to all, and also
because though he were ten thousand times as wicked, he will never teach
what is wicked. But as respects Faith, \[the evil\] is not manifest to
all, and the wicked \[ruler\] will not shrink from teaching it.

<span id="v.xxxviii-p13"></span>Moreover, “Judge not that ye be not
judged” ( [Matt. vii. 1](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#001.md) <span
id="v.xxxviii-p13.1"></span> ) concerns life, not faith: surely what
follows makes this plain. For “why” (He says) “beholdest thou the mote
that is in thy brother’s eye, but considerest not the beam that is in
thine own eye?” ( [Matt. vii. 3](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#003.md) <span
id="v.xxxviii-p13.2"></span> .)

<span id="v.xxxviii-p14"></span>“All things therefore” (He says) “which
they bid you observe, do ye” (now to “do” belongs to works not to Faith)
“but do not ye after their works.” Seest thou that \[the discourse\] is
not concerning doctrines, but concerning life and works?

<span id="v.xxxviii-p15"></span> \[2.\] Paul however previously
commended them,  <span id="fr_3497"></span>[3498](#fn_3497.md) and then
says, “Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves, for
they watch for your souls, as they that shall give account.”

<span id="v.xxxviii-p17"></span> Let those who rule also hear, and not
only those who are under their rule; that as the subjects ought to be
obedient, so also the rulers ought to be watchful and sober. What sayest
thou? He watches; he imperils his own head; he is subject to the
punishments of thy sins, and for thy sake is amenable to what is so
fearful, and art thou slothful, and affectedly indifferent, and at ease?
Therefore he says, “That they may do this with joy, and not with grief:
 <span id="fr_3498"></span>[3499](#fn_3498.md) for this is unprofitable for
you.”

<span id="v.xxxviii-p19"></span>Seest thou that the despised ruler ought
not to avenge himself, but his great revenge is to weep and lament? For
neither is it possible for the physician, despised by his patient, to
avenge himself, but to weep and lament. But if \[the ruler\] lament (he
means), God inflicts vengeance on thee. For if when we lament for our
own sins we draw God to us, shall we not much rather \[do this\], when
we lament for the arrogance and scornfulness of others? Seest thou that
he does not suffer him to be led on to reproaches? Seest thou how great
is his philosophy? He ought to lament who is despised, is trodden under
foot, is spit upon.

<span id="v.xxxviii-p20"></span>Be not confident because he does not
avenge himself on thee, for lamenting is worse than any revenge. For
when of himself he profits nothing by lamenting, he calls on the Lord:
and as in the case of a teacher and nurse, when the child does not
listen to him, one is called in who will treat him more severely, so
also in this case.

<span id="v.xxxviii-p21"></span> \[3.\] Oh! how great the danger! What
should one say to those wretched men, who throw themselves upon so great
an abyss of punishments? Thou hast to give account of all over whom thou
rulest, women and children and men; into so great a fire dost thou put
thy head. I marvel if any of the rulers can be saved, when in the face
of  <span id="fr_3499"></span>[3500](#fn_3499.md) such a threat, and of the
present indifference, I see some still even running on, and casting
themselves upon so great a burden of authority.

<span id="v.xxxviii-p23"></span> For if they who are dragged by force
 <span id="fr_3500"></span>[3501](#fn_3500.md) have no refuge or defense,
if they discharge duty ill and are negligent; since even Aaron was
dragged by force, and yet was imperiled;  <span
id="fr_3501"></span>[3502](#fn_3501.md) and Moses again was imperiled,
although he had oftentimes declined; and Saul having been entrusted with
another kind of rule, after he had declined it, was in peril, because he
managed it amiss; how much more they who take so great pains to obtain
it, and cast themselves upon it? Such an one much more deprives himself
of all excuse. For men ought to fear and to tremble, both because of
conscience, and because of the burden of the office; and neither when
dragged to it should they once for all decline, nor, when not dragged
cast themselves upon it, but should even flee, foreseeing the greatness
of the dignity; and <span id="page_520">p. 520</span> <span
id="v.xxxviii-Page_520"></span> when they have been seized, they ought
again to show their godly fear.  <span
id="fr_3502"></span>[3503](#fn_3502.md) Let there be nothing out of
measure. If thou hast perceived it beforehand, retire; convince thyself
that thou art unworthy of the office. Again, if thou hast been seized,
in like manner be thou reverential,  <span
id="fr_3503"></span>[3504](#fn_3503.md) always showing rightmindedness.
 <span id="fr_3504"></span>[3505](#fn_3504.md)

<span id="v.xxxviii-p29"></span>\[4.\] [Heb.
13.18](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#018.md)<span
id="v.xxxviii-p29.1"></span> . “Pray for us” (he says); “for we trust we
have a good conscience among all,  <span
id="fr_3505"></span>[3506](#fn_3505.md) willing to live honestly.”

<span id="v.xxxviii-p31"></span> Thou seest that he used these
apologies, as writing to persons grieved with him, as to those who
turned away, who were disposed as towards a transgressor, not enduring
even to hear his name? Inasmuch then as he asked from those who hated
him what all others ask from those who love them \[their prayers for
him\], therefore he here introduces this; saying, “We trust that we have
a good conscience.” For do not tell me of accusations; our conscience,
he says, in nothing hurts  <span id="fr_3506"></span>[3507](#fn_3506.md)
us; nor are we conscious to ourselves that we have plotted against you.
“For we trust,” he says, “that we have a good conscience among all,” not
among the Gentiles only, but also among you. We have done nothing with
deceitfulness,  <span id="fr_3507"></span>[3508](#fn_3507.md) nothing with
hypocrisy: for it was probable that these \[calumnies\] were reported
respecting him. “For they have been informed concerning thee” (it is
said) “that thou teachest apostasy.” ( [Acts xxi.
21](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#021.md) <span id="v.xxxviii-p33.4"></span>
.) Not as an enemy, he means, nor as an adversary I write these things,
but as a friend. And this he shows also by what follows.

<span id="v.xxxviii-p34"></span> [Heb.
13.19](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#019.md)<span
id="v.xxxviii-p34.1"></span> . “But I beseech you the rather to do this,
that I may be restored to you the sooner.” His thus praying was \[the
act\] of one who loved them greatly, and that not simply, but with all
earnestness, that so, he says, I may come to you speedily. The earnest
desire to come to them is \[the mark\] of one conscious to himself of
nothing \[wrong\], also the entreating them to pray for him.

<span id="v.xxxviii-p35"></span>Therefore having first asked their
prayers, he then himself also prays for all good things on them. ( [Heb.
13.20](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#020.md)<span
id="v.xxxviii-p35.1"></span> ) “Now the God of peace,” he says (be ye
not therefore at variance one with another), “that brought again from
the earth the Shepherd of the sheep” (this is said concerning the
resurrection) “the Great \[Shepherd\]” (another addition: here again he
confirms to them even to the end, his discourse concerning the
Resurrection) “through the blood of the everlasting covenant, our Lord
Jesus Christ,” ( [Heb. 13.21](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#021.md)<span
id="v.xxxviii-p35.2"></span> ) “make you perfect in every good work, to
do His will, working in you  <span id="fr_3508"></span>[3509](#fn_3508.md)
that which is well-pleasing in His sight.”

<span id="v.xxxviii-p37"></span> Again he bears high testimony to them.
For that is made “perfect” which having a beginning is afterwards
completed. And he prays for them which is the act of one who yearns for
them. And while in the other Epistles, he prays in the prefaces, here he
does it at the end. “Working in you,” he says, “that which is
well-pleasing in His sight through <span class="c11"><span
id="v.xxxviii-p37.1"></span>Jesus</span> Christ, to whom be glory for
ever and ever. Amen.”

<span id="v.xxxviii-p38"></span>\[5.\] [Heb.
13.22](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#022.md)<span
id="v.xxxviii-p38.1"></span> . “And I beseech you, brethren, suffer the
word of exhortation, for indeed I have written a letter unto you in few
words.” Seest thou that what he wrote to no one \[else\], he writes to
them? For (he means) I do not even trouble you with long discourse.

<span id="v.xxxviii-p39"></span> I suppose that they were not at all
unfavorably disposed towards Timothy: wherefore he also put him forward.
 <span id="fr_3509"></span>[3510](#fn_3509.md) For ( [Heb.
13.23](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#023.md)<span
id="v.xxxviii-p40.2"></span> ) “know ye,” he says, “that our brother
Timothy is set at liberty,  <span id="fr_3510"></span>[3511](#fn_3510.md)
with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you.” “Set at liberty,” he
says; from whence? I suppose he had been cast into prison: or if not
this, that he was sent away from Athens. For this also is mentioned in
the Acts.  <span id="fr_3511"></span>[3512](#fn_3511.md)

<span id="v.xxxviii-p43"></span> [Heb.
13:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#024.md),
[25](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#025.md)<span id="v.xxxviii-p43.1"></span>
. “Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints. They
of Italy salute you. Grace be with you all. Amen.”

<span id="v.xxxviii-p44"></span> \[6.\] Seest  <span
id="fr_3512"></span>[3513](#fn_3512.md) thou how he shows that virtue is
born  <span id="fr_3513"></span>[3514](#fn_3513.md) neither wholly from
God, nor yet from ourselves alone? First  <span
id="fr_3514"></span>[3515](#fn_3514.md) by saying, “make you perfect in
every good work”; Ye have virtue indeed, he means, but need to be made
complete. What is “good work and word”?  <span
id="fr_3515"></span>[3516](#fn_3515.md) So as to have both life and
doctrines right. “According to His will, working in you that which is
well-pleasing in His sight.”

<span id="v.xxxviii-p49"></span>“In His sight,” he says. For this is the
highest virtue, to do that which is well-pleasing in the sight of God,
as the Prophet also says, “And according to the cleanness of my hands in
His eye-sight.” ( [Ps. xviii. 24](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#024.md) <span
id="v.xxxviii-p49.1"></span> .)

<span id="v.xxxviii-p50"></span>And having written thus much, he said
this was little, in comparison with what he was going to say. As he says
also in another place, “As I wrote to you in few words: whereby when ye
read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ.” ( [Eph.
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#003.md),
[4](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#004.md)<span id="v.xxxviii-p50.1"></span>
.)

<span id="page_521">p. 521</span> <span id="v.xxxviii-Page_521"></span>

<span id="v.xxxviii-p51"></span> And observe his wisdom. He says not, “I
beseech you, suffer the word of” admonition, but “the word of
exhortation,”  <span id="fr_3516"></span>[3517](#fn_3516.md) that is, of
consolation, of encouragement. No one, he means, can be wearied at the
length of what has been said (Did this then make them turn away from
him? By no means: he does not indeed wish to express this): that is,
even if ye be of little spirit, for it is the peculiarity of such
persons not to endure a long discourse.

<span id="v.xxxviii-p53"></span>“Know ye that our brother Timothy is set
at liberty, with whom if he come shortly I will see you.” This is enough
to persuade them to submit themselves, if he is ready to come with his
disciple.

<span id="v.xxxviii-p54"></span>“Salute them that have the rule over
you, and all the saints.” See how he honored them, since he wrote to
them instead of to those \[their rulers\].

<span id="v.xxxviii-p55"></span>“They of Italy salute you. Grace be with
you all. Amen.” Which was for them all in common.

<span id="v.xxxviii-p56"></span> But how does “Grace” come to be “with”
us? If we do not do despite to the benefit, if we do not become indolent
in regard to the Gift. And what is “the grace”? Remission of sins,
Cleansing: this is “with” us. For who (he means) can keep the Grace
despitefully, and not destroy it? For instance; He freely forgave thee
thy sins. How then shall the “Grace be with” thee, whether it be the
good favor or the effectual working of the <span class="c11"><span
id="v.xxxviii-p56.1"></span>Spirit</span> ? If thou draw it to thee by
good deeds. For the cause of all good things is this, the continual
abiding with us of the “grace” of the Spirit. For this guides us to all
\[good things\], just as when it flies away from us, it ruins us, and
leaves us desolate.

<span id="v.xxxviii-p57"></span>\[7.\] Let us not then drive it from us.
For on ourselves depends, both its remaining, and its departing. For the
one results, when we mind heavenly things; the other, when \[we mind\]
the things of this life. “Which the world” (He says) “cannot receive
because it seeth Him not, neither knoweth Him.” ( [John xiv.
17](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#017.md) <span id="v.xxxviii-p57.1"></span>
.) Seest thou that a worldly soul cannot have Him? We need great
earnestness that so there He may be held fast by us, so as to direct all
our affairs, and do them in security, and in much peace.

<span id="v.xxxviii-p58"></span>For as a ship sailing with favorable
winds is neither to be hindered nor sunk, so long as it enjoys a
prosperous and steady breeze, but also causes great admiration according
to the march of its progress both to the mariners, and to the
passengers, giving rest to the one, and not forcing them to toil on at
their oars, and setting the others free from all fear, and giving them
the most delightful view of her course; so too a soul strengthened by
the Divine Spirit, is far above all the billows of this life, and more
strongly than the ship, cuts the way bearing on to Heaven, since it is
not sent along by wind, but has all the pure sails filled by the
Paraclete Himself: and He casts out of our minds all that is slackened
and relaxed.

<span id="v.xxxviii-p59"></span> For as the wind if it fall upon a
slackened sail, would have no effect; so neither does the Spirit endure
to continue in a slack soul; but there is need of much tension, of much
vehemence, so that our mind may be on fire, and our conduct under all
circumstances on the stretch, and braced up. For instance when we pray,
we ought to do it with much intentness,  <span
id="fr_3517"></span>[3518](#fn_3517.md) stretching forth the soul toward
Heaven, not with cords, but with great earnestness. Again when we do
works of mercy, we have need of intentness, lest by any means, thought
for our household, and care for children, and anxiety about wife, and
fear of poverty entering in, should slacken our sail. For if we put it
on the stretch on all sides by the hope of the things to come, it
receives well the energy  <span id="fr_3518"></span>[3519](#fn_3518.md) of
the <span class="c11"><span id="v.xxxviii-p61.3"></span>Spirit</span> ;
and none of those perishable and wretched things will fall upon it, yea,
and if any of them should fall, it does it no harm, but is quickly
thrown back by the tightness, and is shaken off and fails down.

<span id="v.xxxviii-p62"></span> Therefore we have need of much
intentness. For we too are sailing over a great and wide sea, full of
many monsters, and of many rocks, and bringing forth for us many storms,
and from the midst of serene weather raising up a most violent tempest.
It is necessary then if we would sail with ease, and without danger, to
stretch the sails, that is, our determination: for this is sufficient
for us. For Abraham also, when he had stretched forth his affections
towards God and set before Him his fixed resolution,  <span
id="fr_3519"></span>[3520](#fn_3519.md) what else had he need of? Nothing:
but “he believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.” (
[Gen. xv. 6](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#006.md) <span
id="v.xxxviii-p63.4"></span> .) But Faith \[comes\] of a sincere will.
 <span id="fr_3520"></span>[3521](#fn_3520.md) He offered up his son, and
though he did not slay him, he received a recompense as if he had slain
him, and though the work was not done the reward was given.

<span id="v.xxxviii-p65"></span> Let our sails then be in good order,
 <span id="fr_3521"></span>[3522](#fn_3521.md) not grown old (for
everything “that is decayed and waxen old is nigh to vanishing away”
 <span id="fr_3522"></span>[3523](#fn_3522) .md) ( [Heb.
8.13](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#013.md)<span id="v.xxxviii-p67.3"></span>
), not worn into holes, that so they may bear the energy of the <span
class="c11"><span id="v.xxxviii-p67.4"></span>Spirit</span> . “For the
natural man,”  <span id="fr_3523"></span>[3524](#fn_3523.md) it is said,
“receiveth not the things of the Spirit.” ( [1 Cor. ii.
14](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#014.md) <span id="v.xxxviii-p68.2"></span>
.) For as the webs of spiders could not receive a blast of wind, so
neither will the soul devoted to this life, nor the natural man ever be
able to receive the grace of the Spirit: for our reasonings differ
nothing <span id="page_522">p. 522</span> <span
id="v.xxxviii-Page_522"></span> from them,  <span
id="fr_3524"></span>[3525](#fn_3524.md) preserving a connection in
appearance only but destitute of all power.

<span id="v.xxxviii-p70"></span> \[8.\] Our condition, however, is not
such, if we are watchful: but whatever may fall upon \[the Christian\],
he bears all, and is above all, stronger than any whirlpool.  <span
id="fr_3525"></span>[3526](#fn_3525.md) For suppose there be a spiritual
man, and that innumerable calamities befall him, yet is he overcome by
none of them. And what do I say? Let poverty come upon him, disease,
insults, revilings, mockings, stripes, every sort of infliction, every
sort of mocking, and slanders, and insults: yet, as though he were
outside the world, and set free from the feelings of the body, so will
he laugh all to scorn.

<span id="v.xxxviii-p72"></span>And that my words are not mere boasting,
I think many \[such\] exist even now; for instance, of those who have
embraced the life of the desert. This however, you say, is nothing
wonderful. But I say that of those also who live in cities, there are
such men unsuspected. If thou wish however, I shall be able to exhibit
some among those of old. And that thou mayest learn, consider Paul, I
pray thee. What is there fearful that he did not suffer, and that he did
not submit to? But he bore all nobly. Let us imitate him, for so shall
we be able to land in the tranquil havens with much merchandise.

<span id="v.xxxviii-p73"></span>Let us then stretch our mind towards
Heaven, let us be held fast by that desire, let us clothe ourselves with
spiritual fire, let us gird ourselves with its flame. No man who bears
flame fears those who meet him; be it wild beast, be it man, be it
snares innumerable, so long as he is armed with fire, all things stand
out of his way, all things retire. The flame is intolerable, the fire
cannot be endured, it consumes all.

<span id="v.xxxviii-p74"></span> With this fire let us clothe ourselves,
offering up glory to our Lord <span class="c11"><span
id="v.xxxviii-p74.1"></span>Jesus</span> Christ, with whom to the
Father, together with the Holy Ghost, be glory, might, honor, now and
ever and world without end. Amen.

<span id="v.xxxviii-p75"></span>

<span id="v.xxxviii-p76"></span> Thanks be to God.
