id="iv.lx-p1.1"></span>Homily LVIII.</span>

<span id="iv.lx-p2"></span> <span id="iv.lx-p2.1"></span> <span
class="c1"><span id="iv.lx-p2.2"></span>[John
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#017.md),

<span id="iv.lx-p3"></span>“They say unto the blind man again, What
sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a
Prophet. The Jews then did not believe.”

<span id="iv.lx-p4"></span> \[1.\] <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.lx-p4.1"></span>We</span> must go over the Scriptures not in a
chance way or carelessly, but with all exactness, that we be not
entangled. Since even now in this place one might with show of reason
question, how, when they had asserted, “This man is not of God, because
he keepeth not the Sabbath,” they now say to the man, “What sayest thou
of him, that he hath opened thine eyes?” and not, “What sayest thou of
him, that he hath broken the Sabbath?” but put now that which was the
ground of the defense, not that of the accusation. What then have we to
reply? That these (who speak) are not the men who said, “This man is not
of God,” but those who separated themselves from them, who also said, “A
man that is a sinner cannot  <span id="fr_1536"></span>[1537](#fn_1536.md)
do such miracles.” For desiring to silence their opponents the more, in
order that they may not seem to be partisans of Christ, they bring
forward the man who had received proof of His power, and question him.
Observe now the wisdom of the poor man, he speaketh more wisely than
them all. First he saith, “He is a Prophet”; and shrank not from the
judgment  <span id="fr_1537"></span>[1538](#fn_1537.md) of the perverse
Jews who spake against Him and said, “How can this man be of God, not
keeping the Sabbath?” but replied to them, “He is a Prophet.”

<span id="iv.lx-p7"></span> “And they  <span
id="fr_1538"></span>[1539](#fn_1538.md) did not believe that he had been
blind, and received his sight, until they had called his parents.”
 <span id="fr_1539"></span>[1540](#fn_1539.md)

<span id="iv.lx-p10"></span>Observe in how many ways they attempt to
obscure and take away the miracle. But this is the nature of truth, by
the very means by which it seems to be assailed by men, by these it
becomes stronger, it shines by means of that by which it is obscured.
For if these things had not taken place, the miracle might have been
suspected by the many; but now, as if desiring to lay bare the truth, so
do they use all means, and would not have acted otherwise, supposing
they had done all in Christ’s behalf. For they first attempted to cast
Him down by occasion of this mode (of cure), saying, “How opened he
thine eyes?” that is, “was it by some sorcery?” In another place also,
when they had no charge to bring against Him, they endeavored to insult
the mode of the cure, saying, “He doth not cast out devils save by
Beelzebub.” ( [Matt. xii. 24](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#024.md) <span
id="iv.lx-p10.1"></span> .) And here again, when they have nothing to
say, they betake themselves to the time (of cure), saying, “He breaketh
the Sabbath”; and again, “He is a sinner.” Yet He asked you, who would
slay  <span id="fr_1540"></span>[1541](#fn_1540.md) Him, and who were ready
to lay hold of His actions, most plainly, saying, “Which of you
convinceth Me of sin?” ( [John
8.46](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#046)<span id="iv.lx-p11.3"></span> .md);
and no man spake, nor said “Thou blasphemest because thou makest thyself
without sin.” But if they had had it in their power to say so, they
would not have held their peace. For they who because they heard that He
was before Abraham would have stoned Him, and said that He was not of
God, who boasted that they, murderers as they were, were of God, but who
said that One who did such wonders, after that He had wrought a cure,
was not of God,  <span id="fr_1541"></span>[1542](#fn_1541.md) because He
kept not the Sabbath, if they had had but a shadow of a charge against
Him, would never have let it pass. And if they call Him a sinner because
He seemed to break the Sabbath, this charge also is shown to be unsound,
when those who are ranked with them condemn their great coldness and
littleness of soul.  <span id="fr_1542"></span>[1543](#fn_1542.md) Being
therefore entangled on every side, they afterwards betake themselves to
something else more shameless and impudent. What is that? They “did not
believe,” It saith, “that <span id="page_206">p. 206</span> <span
id="iv.lx-Page_206"></span> he had been blind, and received his sight.”
How then did they charge Christ with not keeping the Sabbath? Plainly,
as having believed. But why gave ye not heed to the great number of
people? to the neighbors who knew him? As I said, falsehood everywhere
defeats itself by the very means by which it seems to annoy the truth,
and makes the truth to appear more bright. Which was now the case. For
that no one might say that his neighbors and those who had seen him did
not speak with precision, but guessed from a likeness,  <span
id="fr_1543"></span>[1544](#fn_1543.md) they bring forward his parents, by
whom they succeeded against their will in proving that what had taken
place was real,  <span id="fr_1544"></span>[1545](#fn_1544.md) since the
parents best of all knew their own child. When they could not terrify
the man himself, but beheld him with all boldness proclaim his
Benefactor, they thought to wound the miracle by means of his parents.
Observe the malice of their questioning. For what saith it? Having
placed them in the midst so as to throw them into distress,  <span
id="fr_1545"></span>[1546](#fn_1545.md) they apply the questioning with
great severity and anger,

<span id="iv.lx-p17"></span> [John
9.19](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#019.md)<span id="iv.lx-p17.1"></span> .
“Is this your son?” (and they said not, “who once was blind,” but) “of
whom ye say that he was born blind?”

<span id="iv.lx-p18"></span> As if they were acting deceitfully, and
plotting on behalf of  <span id="fr_1546"></span>[1547](#fn_1546.md)
Christ. O ye accursed, utterly accursed! What father would choose to
invent such falsehoods against his child? For they almost say, “Whom ye
have made out blind, and not only so, but have spread abroad the report
everywhere.”

<span id="iv.lx-p20"></span>“How then doth he now see?”

<span id="iv.lx-p21"></span> \[2.\] O folly! “Yours,” saith one, “is the
trick  <span id="fr_1547"></span>[1548](#fn_1547.md) and the contrivance.”
For by these two things do they attempt to lead the parents to a denial;
by using the words, “Whom ye say,” and, “How then doth he now see?” Now
when there were three questions asked, whether he was their son, whether
he had been blind, and how he received his sight, the parents only
acknowledged two of them, but do not add the third. And this came to
pass for the sake of the truth, in order that none other save the man
that was healed, who was also worthy  <span
id="fr_1548"></span>[1549](#fn_1548.md) of credit, should acknowledge this
matter.  And how would the parents have favored (Christ), when even of
what they knew some part they spake not through fear of the Jews? What
say they?

<span id="iv.lx-p24"></span> [John
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#020.md),
[21](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#021.md)<span id="iv.lx-p24.1"></span> .
“We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind; but by what
means he now seeth we know not, or who hath opened his eyes we know not;
he is of age, he shall speak for himself.”

<span id="iv.lx-p25"></span> By making him to be worthy of credit, they
begged off themselves; “He is not a child, say they, nor incapable,
 <span id="fr_1549"></span>[1550](#fn_1549.md) but able to testify for
himself.”

<span id="iv.lx-p27"></span> [John
9.22](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#022.md)<span id="iv.lx-p27.1"></span> .
“These words spake they,  <span id="fr_1550"></span>[1551](#fn_1550.md)
because they feared the Jews.”

<span id="iv.lx-p29"></span>Observe how the Evangelist again brings
forward their opinion and thoughts. This I say, because of that speech
which they before uttered, when they said, “He maketh Himself equal to
God.” ( [John 5.18](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#018.md)<span
id="iv.lx-p29.1"></span> .) For had that also been the opinion of the
Jews but not the judgment of Christ, he would have added and said, that
“it was a Jewish opinion.”  <span id="fr_1551"></span>[1552](#fn_1551.md)
When therefore the parents referred them to him that had been healed,
they called him again the second time, and did not say openly and
shamelessly, “Deny that Christ healed thee,” but would fain effect this
under a pretense of piety.

<span id="iv.lx-p31"></span> [John
9.24](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#024.md)<span id="iv.lx-p31.1"></span> .
“Give,”  <span id="fr_1552"></span>[1553](#fn_1552.md) saith one, “the
glory to God.”

<span id="iv.lx-p33"></span> For to have said to the parents, “Deny that
he is your son, and that he was born  <span
id="fr_1553"></span>[1554](#fn_1553.md) blind,” would have seemed very
ridiculous. And again, to have said this to himself would have been
manifest shamelessness. Wherefore they say not so, but manage the matter
in another way, saying, “Give God the glory,” that is, “confess that
this man hath wrought nothing.”

<span id="iv.lx-p35"></span>“We know that this man is a sinner.”

<span id="iv.lx-p36"></span>“Why then did ye not convict Him when He
said, ‘Which of you convinceth Me of sin?’ ( [John
8.46](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#046)<span id="iv.lx-p36.1"></span> ..md)
Whence know ye that He is a sinner?” After that they had said, “Give God
the glory,” and the man had made no reply, Christ meeting praised him,
and did not rebuke him, nor say, “Wherefore hast thou not given glory to
God?” But what said He? “Dost thou believe on the Son of God?”  <span
id="fr_1554"></span>[1555](#fn_1554.md) ( [John
9.35](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#035)<span id="iv.lx-p37.3"></span> .md),
that thou mayest learn that this is “to give glory to God.” Now had He
not been equal in honor to the Father, this would not have been giving
glory; but since he that honoreth the Son honoreth the Father also, the
blind is with good reason not rebuked. Now while they expected that the
parents would contradict and deny the miracle, the Pharisees said
nothing to the man himself, but when they saw that they profited nothing
by this, they again return to him, saying, “This man is a sinner.”

<span id="iv.lx-p38"></span> [John
9.25](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#025.md)<span id="iv.lx-p38.1"></span> .
“He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not; one
thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.”

<span id="iv.lx-p39"></span>Surely the blind man was not terrified? That
be far from him. How then doth he who said, <span id="page_207">p.
207</span> <span id="iv.lx-Page_207"></span> “He is a Prophet” ( [John
9.17](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#017)<span id="iv.lx-p39.1"></span> .md),
now say, “Whether he be a sinner, I know not”? He said so, not as being
in such a state of mind, nor as having persuaded himself of this thing,
but desiring to clear Him from their charges by the testimony of the
fact, not by  <span id="fr_1555"></span>[1556](#fn_1555.md) his own
declaration, and to make the defense credible, when the testimony of the
good deed done should decide the matter against them. Since if after
many words when the blind man said, “Except this were a righteous man he
could not do such miracles” ( [John
9.33](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#033)<span id="iv.lx-p40.3"></span> .md),
they were so enraged as to reply, “Thou wast altogether born in sin, and
dost thou teach us?” what would they not have said, if he had spoken so
from the beginning; what would they not have done? “Whether he be a
sinner or not, I know not”; as though he had said, “I say nothing in
this man’s favor, I make no declaration at present, yet this I certainly
know and would affirm, that if he were a sinner he could not have done
such things.” Thus he kept himself free from suspicion, and his
testimony uncorrupted, as not speaking from partiality, but as bearing
witness according to the fact. When therefore they could neither upset
nor remove what had been done, they again return to their former plan,
making trifling enquiries about the manner of the cure, like men  <span
id="fr_1556"></span>[1557](#fn_1556.md) who search on every side about a
prey which is before them, and cannot be hurt,  <span
id="fr_1557"></span>[1558](#fn_1557.md) hastening round now in one
direction, now in another; and they recur to the man’s former
assertions, in order now to make them unsound by continual questions,
and say,

<span id="iv.lx-p43"></span> [John
9.26](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#026.md)<span id="iv.lx-p43.1"></span> .
“What did he to thee? How opened he thine eyes?”

<span id="iv.lx-p44"></span>What was his reply? Having conquered and
cast them down, he no longer speaks to them submissly. As long as the
matter needed enquiry and arguments he spake guardedly, while he
supplied the proof; but when he had conquered and gained a splendid
victory, he then takes courage, and tramples upon them. What saith he?

<span id="iv.lx-p45"></span> [John
9.27](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#027.md)<span id="iv.lx-p45.1"></span> .
“I have told you once,  <span id="fr_1558"></span>[1559](#fn_1558.md) and
ye did not hear; wherefore would ye hear it again?”

<span id="iv.lx-p47"></span> Seest thou the bold-speaking of a beggar
towards Scribes and Pharisees? So strong is truth, so weak is falsehood.
Truth, though she take hold but of ordinary men, maketh them to appear
glorious; the other, even though it be with the strong, shows them weak.
 <span id="fr_1559"></span>[1560](#fn_1559.md) What he saith is of this
kind: “Ye give no heed to my words, therefore I will no longer speak or
answer you continually, who question  <span
id="fr_1560"></span>[1561](#fn_1560.md) me to no purpose, and who do not
desire to hear in order to learn, but that you may insult over my
words.”

<span id="iv.lx-p50"></span>“Will ye also be His disciples?”

<span id="iv.lx-p51"></span> \[3.\] Now he hath ranked  <span
id="fr_1561"></span>[1562](#fn_1561.md) himself among the band of
disciples, for the “will ye also?” is the expression of one who is
declaring himself to be a disciple. Then he mocked and annoyed them
abundantly. For since he knew that this struck them hard, he said it,
wishing to upbraid them with exceeding severity; the act of a soul
courageous, soaring on high and despising their madness, pointing out
the greatness of this dignity, in which he was very confident, and
showing that they insulted him who was a man worthy to be admired, but
that he took not the insult to himself, but grasped as an honor what
they offered as a reproach.

<span id="iv.lx-p53"></span> [John
9.28](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#028.md)<span id="iv.lx-p53.1"></span> .
“Thou art his disciple, but we are Moses’ disciples.”

<span id="iv.lx-p54"></span>“But this cannot be. Ye are neither Moses’
nor this Man’s; for were ye Moses’, ye would become this Man’s also.”
Wherefore Christ before said unto them, because they were continually
betaking themselves to these speeches, “Had ye believed Moses, ye would
have believed Me, for he wrote of Me.” ( [John
5.46](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#046)<span id="iv.lx-p54.1"></span> ..md)

<span id="iv.lx-p55"></span> [John
9.29](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#029.md)<span id="iv.lx-p55.1"></span> .
“We know that God spake unto Moses.”  <span
id="fr_1562"></span>[1563](#fn_1562.md)

<span id="iv.lx-p57"></span>By whose word, whose report? “That of our
forefathers,” saith one. Is not He then more to be believed than your
forefathers, who confirmeth by miracles that He came from God, and that
He speaketh things from above? They said not, “We have heard that God
spake to Moses,” but, “We know.” Do ye affirm, O Jews, what ye have by
hearing, as knowing it, but deem what ye have by sight as less certain
than what ye have by hearing? Yet the one ye saw not, but heard, the
other ye did not hear, but saw. What then saith the blind man?

<span id="iv.lx-p58"></span> [John
9.30](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#030.md)<span id="iv.lx-p58.1"></span> .
“Why herein is a marvelous thing, that ye know not whence He is, and He
doeth such miracles.”  <span id="fr_1563"></span>[1564](#fn_1563.md)

<span id="iv.lx-p60"></span>“That a Man, who is not one of the
distinguished or noble or illustrious among you, can do such things; so
that it is in every way clear that He is God, needing no human aid.”

<span id="iv.lx-p61"></span> [John
9.31](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#031.md)<span id="iv.lx-p61.1"></span> .
“We know that God heareth not sinners.”

<span id="iv.lx-p62"></span>Since they had been the first to say, “How
can a man that is a sinner do such miracles?” ( [John
9.16](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#016)<span id="iv.lx-p62.1"></span> .md),
he now brings forward even their judgment, reminding them of their own
words. “This opinion,” saith he, “is common to me and you. Stand fast
now to it.” And observe, I pray you, his wisdom. He turns about the
miracle in every way, because they could not <span id="page_208">p.
208</span> <span id="iv.lx-Page_208"></span> do away with it, and from
it he draws his inferences. Seest thou that at first he said “Whether he
be a sinner or not, I know not”? not doubting (God forbid!) but knowing
that He was not a sinner. At least now, when he had an opportunity, see
how he defended Him. “We know that God heareth not sinners”:

<span id="iv.lx-p63"></span> “But if any man be a worshiper of God, and
doeth His will.”  <span id="fr_1564"></span>[1565](#fn_1564.md)

<span id="iv.lx-p65"></span> Here he not only hath cleared Him from sin,
but declareth that He is very pleasing to God, and doeth all His will.
For since they called themselves  <span
id="fr_1565"></span>[1566](#fn_1565.md) worshipers of God, he added, “and
doeth His will”; “since,” saith he, “it is not sufficient to know God:
men must also do His will.” Then he magnifies what had been done,
saying,

<span id="iv.lx-p67"></span> [John
9.32](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#032.md)<span id="iv.lx-p67.1"></span> .
“Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of
one that was born blind.”  <span id="fr_1566"></span>[1567](#fn_1566.md)

<span id="iv.lx-p69"></span> “If now ye acknowledge  <span
id="fr_1567"></span>[1568](#fn_1567.md) that God heareth not sinners, and
this Person hath wrought a miracle, and such a miracle as no man ever
wrought, it is clear that He hath surpassed all things in  <span
id="fr_1568"></span>[1569](#fn_1568.md) virtue, and that His power is
greater than belongeth to man.” What then say they?

<span id="iv.lx-p72"></span> [John
9.34](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#034.md)<span id="iv.lx-p72.1"></span> .
“Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us?”

<span id="iv.lx-p73"></span> As long as they expected that he would deny
Christ, they deemed him trustworthy, calling upon him once and a second
time. If ye  <span id="fr_1569"></span>[1570](#fn_1569.md) deemed him not
trustworthy, why did ye call and question him a second time? But when he
spake the truth, unabashed, then, when they ought most to have admired,
they condemned him. But what is the, “Thou wast altogether born in
sins”? They here unsparingly reproach him with his very blindness, as
though they had said, “Thou art in sins from thy earliest age;”
insinuating that on this account he was born blind; which was contrary
to reason. On this point at least Christ comforting him said, “For
judgment I am come into the world, that they which see not might see,
and that they which see might be made blind.” ( [John
9.39](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#039)<span id="iv.lx-p74.4"></span> ..md)

<span id="iv.lx-p75"></span>“Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost
thou teach us?” Why, what had the man said? Did he set forth his private
opinion? Did he not set forth a common judgment, saying, “We know that
God heareth not sinners”? Did he not produce your own words?

<span id="iv.lx-p76"></span>“And they cast him out.”

<span id="iv.lx-p77"></span>Hast thou beheld the herald of the truth,
how poverty was no hindrance to his true wisdom? Seest thou what
reproaches, what sufferings he bare from the beginning, and how by word
and by deed he testified?

<span id="iv.lx-p78"></span> \[4.\] Now these things are recorded, that
we too may imitate them. For if the blind man, the beggar, who had not
even seen Him, straightway showed such boldness even before he was
encouraged by Christ, standing opposed to a whole people, murderous,
possessed, and raving, who desired by means of his voice to condemn
Christ, if he neither yielded nor gave back, but most boldly stopped
their mouths, and chose rather to be cast out than to betray the truth;
how much more ought we, who have lived so long in the faith, who have
seen ten thousand marvels wrought by faith, who have received greater
benefits than he, have recovered the sight of the eyes within, have
beheld the ineffable Mysteries, and have been called to such honor, how
ought we, I say, to exhibit all boldness of speech towards those who
attempt to accuse, and who say anything against the Christians, and to
stop their mouths, and not to acquiesce without an effort. And we shall
be able to do this, if we are bold,  <span
id="fr_1570"></span>[1571](#fn_1570.md) and give heed to the Scriptures,
and hear them not carelessly. For if one should come in here regularly,
even though he read not at home, if he attends to what is said here, one
year even is sufficient to make him well versed in them; because we do
not to-day read one kind of Scriptures, and tomorrow another, but always
and continually the same. Still such is the wretched disposition of the
many, that after so much reading, they do not even know the names of the
Books, and are not ashamed nor tremble at entering so carelessly into a
place where they may hear God’s word. Yet if a harper, or dancer, or
stage-player call the city, they all run eagerly, and feel obliged to
him for the call, and spend the half of an entire day in attending to
him alone; but when God speaketh to us by Prophets and Apostles, we
yawn, we scratch ourselves, we are drowsy. And in summer, the heat seems
too great, and we betake ourselves to the market place; and again, in
winter, the rain and mire are a hindrance, and we sit at home; yet at
horse races, though there is no roof over them to keep off the wet, the
greater number, while heavy  <span id="fr_1571"></span>[1572](#fn_1571.md)
rains are falling, and the wind is dashing the water into their faces,
stand like madmen, caring not for cold, and wet, and mud, and length of
way, and nothing either keeps them at home, or prevents their going
thither. But here, where there are roofs over head, and where the warmth
is admirable, they hold back instead of running together; and this too,
when the gain is that of their own souls. How is this tolerable, tell
me? Thus it happens, that while we are <span id="page_209">p. 209</span>
<span id="iv.lx-Page_209"></span> more skilled than any in those
matters, in things necessary we are more ignorant than children. If a
man call you a charioteer, or a dancer, you say that you have been
insulted, and use every means to wipe off the affront; but if he draw
you to be a spectator of the action, you do not start away, and the art
whose name you shun, you almost in every case pursue. But where you
ought  <span id="fr_1572"></span>[1573](#fn_1572.md) to have both the
action and the name, both to be and to be called a Christian, you do not
even know what kind of thing the action is. What can be worse than this
folly?  <span id="fr_1573"></span>[1574](#fn_1573.md) These things I have
desired continually to say to you, but I fear lest I gain hatred in vain
and unprofitably. For I perceive that not only the young are mad, but
the old also; about whom I am especially ashamed, when I see a man
venerable from his white hairs, disgracing those white hairs, and
drawing a child after him. What is worse than this mockery? What more
shameful than this conduct? The child is taught by the father to act
unseemly.

<span id="iv.lx-p83"></span> \[5.\] Do the words sting? This is what I
desire, that you should suffer the pain caused by the words, in order to
be delivered from the disgrace caused by the actions. For there are some
too far colder than these, who are not even ashamed at the things spoken
of, nay, who even put together  <span
id="fr_1574"></span>[1575](#fn_1574.md) a long argument in defense of the
action. If you ask them who was Amos or Obadiah, or what is the number
of the Prophets or Apostles, they cannot even open their mouth but for
horses and charioteers, they compose excuses more cleverly than sophists
or rhetoricians, and after all this, they say, “What is the harm? what
is the loss?” This is what I groan for, that ye do not so much as know
that the action is a loss, nor have a sense of its evils. God hath given
to thee an appointed space of life for serving Him, and dost thou while
thou spendest it vainly, and at random, and on nothing useful, still
ask, “What loss is there?” If thou hast spent a little money to no
purpose, thou callest it a loss: when thou spendest whole days of thine
upon the devil’s pageants, thinkest thou that thou art doing nothing
wrong? Thou oughtest to spend all thy life in supplications  <span
id="fr_1575"></span>[1576](#fn_1575.md) and prayers, whereas thou wastest
thy life and substance  <span id="fr_1576"></span>[1577](#fn_1576.md)
heedlessly, and to thine own hurt, on shouts, and uproar, and shameful
words, and fighting, and unseasonable pleasure, and actions performed by
trickery, and after all this thou askest, “What is the loss?” not
knowing thou shouldest be lavish of anything rather than time.  <span
id="fr_1577"></span>[1578](#fn_1577.md) Gold, if thou shalt have spent,
thou mayest get again; but if thou lose time, thou shalt hardly recover
that. Little is dealt out to us in this present life; if therefore we
employ it not as we ought, what shall we say when we depart “there”? For
tell me, if thou hadst commanded one of thy sons to learn some art, and
then he had continually stayed at home, or even passed his time
somewhere else, would not the teacher reject him? Would he not say to
thee, “Thou hast made an agreement with me, and appointed a time; if now
thy son will not spend this time with me but in other places, how shall
I produce him to thee as a scholar?”  <span
id="fr_1578"></span>[1579](#fn_1578.md) Thus also we must speak. For God
will say also to us, “I gave you time to learn this art of piety,
wherefore have ye foolishly and uselessly wasted that time? Why did ye
neither go constantly to the teacher, nor give heed to his words?” For
to show that piety is an art, hear what the Prophet saith, “Come, ye
children, hearken unto me; I will teach you the fear of the Lord.” (
[Ps. xxxiv. 11](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#011.md) <span
id="iv.lx-p88.3"></span> .) And again, “Blessed is the man whom Thou
instructest, Lord, and teachest him out of Thy Law.” ( [Ps. xciv.
12](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#012) <span id="iv.lx-p88.4"></span> ..md)
When therefore thou hast spent this time in vain, what excuse wilt thou
have? “And why,” saith some one, “did He deal out to us but little
time?” O senselessness and ingratitude! That for which thou wert most
bounden to give thanks to Him, for that He hath cut short thy labors and
abridged thy toils, and made the rest long and everlasting, for this
dost thou find fault, and art discontented?

<span id="iv.lx-p89"></span> But I know not how we have brought our
discourse to this point, and have made it so long; we must therefore
shorten it now. For this too is a part of our wretchedness, that here if
the discourse be long, we all become careless, while there  <span
id="fr_1579"></span>[1580](#fn_1579.md) they begin at noon, and retire by
torch and lamp light. However, that we be not always chiding, we now
entreat and beseech you, grant this favor to us and  <span
id="fr_1580"></span>[1581](#fn_1580.md) to yourselves; and getting free
from all other matters, to these let us rivet ourselves. So shall we
gain from you joy and gladness, and honor on your account, and a
recompense for these labors; while ye will reap all the reward, because
having been aforetime so madly riveted to the stage, ye tore yourselves
away, through fear of God, and by our exhortations, from that malady,
and brake your bonds, and hastened unto God. Nor is it “there” alone
that ye shall receive your reward, but “here” also ye shall enjoy pure
pleasure. Such a thing is virtue; besides giving us crowns in heaven,
even here it maketh life pleasant to us. Let us then be persuaded by
what has been <span id="page_210">p. 210</span> <span
id="iv.lx-Page_210"></span> said, that we may obtain the blessings both
here and hereafter, through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord
Jesus Christ, by whom and with whom, to the Father and the Holy Ghost be
glory, now and ever and world without end. Amen.
