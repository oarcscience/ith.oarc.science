<span id="iv.liii-p1"></span> <span class="c15"><span
id="iv.liii-p1.1"></span>Homily LI.</span>

<span id="iv.liii-p2"></span> <span id="iv.liii-p2.1"></span> <span
class="c1"><span id="iv.liii-p2.2"></span>[John
7:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#037.md),
[38](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#038.md)<span
id="iv.liii-p2.3"></span></span>

<span id="iv.liii-p3"></span>“In the last day, the great day of the
feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come
unto Me, and drink. He that believeth on Me, as the Scripture hath said,
out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.”

<span id="iv.liii-p4"></span> \[1.\] <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.liii-p4.1"></span>They</span> who come to the divine preaching
and give heed to the faith, must manifest the desire of thirsty men for
water, and kindle in themselves a similar longing; so will they be able
also very carefully to retain what is said. For as thirsty men, when
they have taken a bowl, eagerly drain it and then desist, so too they
who hear the divine oracles if they receive them thirsting, will never
be weary until they have drunk them up.  For to show that men ought ever
to thirst and hunger, “Blessed,” It saith, “are they which do hunger and
thirst after righteousness” ( [Matt. v.
6](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#006) <span id="iv.liii-p4.2"></span> .md);
and here Christ saith, “If any man thirst, let him come unto Me, and
drink.” What He saith is of this kind, “I draw no man to Me by necessity
and constraint; but if any hath great zeal, if any is inflamed with
desire, him I call.”

<span id="iv.liii-p5"></span> But why hath the Evangelist remarked that
it was “on the last day, that great day”? For both the first day and the
last were “great,” while the intermediate days they spent rather in
enjoyment. Wherefore then saith he, “in the last day”? Because on that
day they were all collected together. For on the first day He came not,
and told the reason to His brethren, nor yet on the second and third
days saith He anything of this kind, lest His words should come to
nought, the hearers being about to run into indulgence. But on the last
day when they were returning home He giveth them supplies  <span
id="fr_1427"></span>[1428](#fn_1427.md) for their salvation, and crieth
aloud, partly by this showing to us His boldness, and partly for the
greatness of the multitude. And to show that He spake not of material
drink, He addeth, “He that believeth on Me, as the Scripture hath said,
out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.” By “belly” he here
meaneth the heart, as also in another place It saith, “And Thy Law in
the midst of my belly.” ( [Ps. xl. 10](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#010.md)
<span id="iv.liii-p6.3"></span> ; Theodotion.) But where hath the
Scripture said, that “rivers of living water shall flow from his belly”?
Nowhere. What then meaneth, “He that believeth on Me, as the Scripture
saith”? Here we must place a stop, so that the, “rivers shall flow from
his belly,” may be an assertion of Christ.  <span
id="fr_1428"></span>[1429](#fn_1428.md) For because many said, “This is the
Christ”; and, “When the Christ cometh will He do more miracles?” He
showeth that it behooveth to have a correct knowledge, and to be
convinced not so much from the miracles as from <span id="page_182">p.
182</span> <span id="iv.liii-Page_182"></span> the Scriptures. Many, in
fact, who even saw Him working marvels received Him not as Christ, and
were ready to say, “Do not the Scriptures say that Christ cometh of the
seed of David?” and on this they  <span
id="fr_1429"></span>[1430](#fn_1429.md) continually dwelt. He then,
desiring to show that He did not shun the proof from the Scriptures,
again referreth them to the Scriptures. He had said before, “Search the
Scriptures” ( [John 5.39](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#039.md)<span
id="iv.liii-p8.4"></span> ); and again, “It is written in the Prophets,
And they shall be taught of God” ( [John
6.45](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#045)<span id="iv.liii-p8.5"></span> .md);
and, “Moses accuseth you” ( [John
5.45](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#045)<span id="iv.liii-p8.6"></span> .md);
and here,“ As the Scripture hath said, rivers shall flow from his
belly,” alluding to the largeness and abundance of grace. As in another
place He saith, “A well of water springing up unto eternal life” ( [John
4.14](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#014)<span id="iv.liii-p8.7"></span> .md),
that is to say, “he shall possess much grace”; and elsewhere He calleth
it, “eternal life,” but here, “living water.” He calleth that “living”
which ever worketh; for the grace of the Spirit, when it hath entered
into the mind and hath been established, springeth up more than any
fountain, faileth not, becometh not empty, stayeth not. To signify
therefore at once its unfailing supply and unlimited  <span
id="fr_1430"></span>[1431](#fn_1430.md) operation, He hath called it “a
well” and “rivers,” not one river but numberless; and in the former case
He hath represented its abundance by the expression, “springing.” And
one may clearly perceive what is meant, if he will consider the wisdom
of Stephen, the tongue of Peter, the vehemence of Paul, how nothing
bare, nothing withstood them, not the anger of multitudes, not the
risings up of tyrants, not the plots of devils, not daily deaths, but as
rivers borne along with a great rushing sound, so they went on their way
hurrying all things with them.

<span id="iv.liii-p10"></span> [John
7.39](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#039.md)<span id="iv.liii-p10.1"></span> .
“But this spake He of the Spirit, which they that believe on Him should
receive; for the Holy Ghost was not yet given.”

<span id="iv.liii-p11"></span>\[2.\] How then did the Prophets prophesy
and work those ten thousand wonders? For the Apostles cast not out
devils by the Spirit, but by power received from Him; as He saith
Himself, “If I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your children
cast them out?” ( [Matt. xii. 27](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#027.md) <span
id="iv.liii-p11.1"></span> .) And this He said, signifying that before
the Crucifixion  <span id="fr_1431"></span>[1432](#fn_1431.md) not all cast
out devils by the Spirit, but that some did so by the power received
from Him. So when  <span id="fr_1432"></span>[1433](#fn_1432.md) He was
about to send them, He said, “Receive ye the Holy Ghost” ( [John
20.22](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#022.md)<span id="iv.liii-p13.2"></span>
); and again, “The Holy Ghost came upon them” ( [Acts xix.
6](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#006) <span id="iv.liii-p13.3"></span> .md),
and then they wrought miracles. But when  <span
id="fr_1433"></span>[1434](#fn_1433.md) He was sending them, the Scripture
said not, that “He gave to them the Holy Ghost,” but that He gave to
them “power,” saying, “Cleanse the lepers, cast out devils, raise the
dead, freely ye have received, freely give.” ( [Matt.
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#001.md),
[8](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#008)<span id="iv.liii-p14.2"></span> ..md)
But in the case of the Prophets, all allow that the Gift was that of the
Holy Spirit. But this Grace was stinted and departed and failed from off
the earth, from the day in which it was said, “Your house is left unto
you desolate” ( [Matt. xxiii. 38](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#038.md) <span
id="iv.liii-p14.3"></span> ); and even before that day its dearth had
begun, for there was no longer any prophet among them, nor did Grace
visit their holy  <span id="fr_1434"></span>[1435](#fn_1434.md) things.
Since then the Holy Ghost had been withheld, but was for the future to
be shed forth abundantly, and since the beginning of this imparting was
after the Crucifixion, not only as to its abundance, but also as to the
increased greatness of the gifts, (for the Gift was more marvelous, as
when It saith, “Ye know not what Spirit ye are of” ( [Luke ix.
55](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#055) <span id="iv.liii-p15.3"></span> .md);
and again, “For ye have not received the Spirit of bondage, but the
Spirit of adoption” ( [Rom. viii. 15](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#015.md)
<span id="iv.liii-p15.4"></span> ); and the men of old possessed the
Spirit themselves, but imparted It not to others, while the Apostles
filled tens of thousands with It,) since then, I say, they were to
receive this Gift, but It was not yet given, for this cause he addeth,
“The Holy Ghost was not yet.” Since then the Lord spoke of this grace,
 <span id="fr_1435"></span>[1436](#fn_1435.md) the Evangelist hath said,
“For the Holy Ghost was not yet,” that is, “was not yet given,”

<span id="iv.liii-p17"></span>“Because Jesus was not yet glorified.”

<span id="iv.liii-p18"></span>Calling the Cross, “glory.” For since we
were enemies, and had sinned, and fallen short of the gift of God, and
were haters of God, and since grace was a proof of our reconciliation,
and since a gift is not given to those who are hated, but to friends and
those who have been well-pleasing; it was therefore necessary that the
Sacrifice should first be offered for us, that the enmity (against God)
which was in our flesh should be done away, that we should become
friends of God, and so receive the Gift. For if this was done with
respect to the promise made to Abraham, much more with respect to grace.
And this Paul hath declared, saying, “If they which are of the Law be
heirs, faith is made void—because the Law worketh wrath.” ( [Rom.
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#014.md),
[15](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#015)<span id="iv.liii-p18.1"></span> ..md)
What he saith, is of this kind: God “promised that He would give the
earth to Abraham and to his seed: but his descendants were unworthy of
the promise, and of their own deeds could not be well-pleasing unto God.
On this account came in faith, an easy action, that it might draw grace
unto it, and that the promise might not fail. And It saith,

<span id="iv.liii-p19"></span>“Therefore it is of faith, that it might
be by grace, to the end the promise might be sure.” ( [Rom. iv.
16](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#016) <span id="iv.liii-p19.1"></span> ..md)
Wherefore it is by grace, since by their own labors they prevailed not.

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span> <span id="iv.liii-Page_183"></span>

<span id="iv.liii-p20"></span> But wherefore after saying, “according to
the Scriptures,”  <span id="fr_1436"></span>[1437](#fn_1436.md) did He not
add the testimony? Because their mind was corrupt; for,

<span id="iv.liii-p22"></span> [John
7.40-42](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#040.md)<span
id="iv.liii-p22.1"></span> .  <span id="fr_1437"></span>[1438](#fn_1437.md)
“Some said, This is the Prophet. Others said, He deceiveth the people;
 <span id="fr_1438"></span>[1439](#fn_1438.md) others said, Christ cometh
not from Galilee, but from the village of Bethlehem.”

<span id="iv.liii-p25"></span>Others said, “When Christ cometh, no man
knoweth whence He is” ( [John
7.27](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#027.md)<span id="iv.liii-p25.1"></span>
); and there was a difference of opinion, as might be expected in a
confused  <span id="fr_1439"></span>[1440](#fn_1439.md) multitude; for not
attentively did they listen to His words, nor for the sake of learning.
Wherefore He maketh them no answer; yet they said, “Doth Christ come out
of Galilee?” And He had praised, as being “an Israelite indeed,”
Nathanael, who had said in a more forcible and striking manner, “Can
there any good thing come out of Nazareth?” ( [John
1.46](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#046.md)<span id="iv.liii-p26.3"></span>
.) But then these men, and they who said to Nicodemus, “Search and look,
for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet” ( [John
7.52](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#052.md)<span id="iv.liii-p26.4"></span>
), said it not seeking to learn, but merely to overturn the opinion
concerning Christ. Nathanael said this, being a lover of the truth, and
knowing exactly all the ancient histories; but they looked only to one
thing, and that was to remove the opinion that He was the Christ, on
which account He revealed nothing to them. For they who even
contradicted themselves, and said at one time, “No man knoweth whence He
cometh,” at another, “From Bethlehem,” would manifestly even if they had
been informed have opposed Him. For be it that they knew not the place
of His birth, that He was from Bethlehem, because of His dwelling  <span
id="fr_1440"></span>[1441](#fn_1440.md) in Nazareth, (yet this cannot be
allowed, for He was not born there,) were they ignorant of His race
also, that He was “of the house and lineage of David”? How then said
they, “Doth not Christ come of the seed of David?” ( [John
7.42](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#042.md)<span id="iv.liii-p27.3"></span>
.) Because they wished to conceal even this fact by that question,
saying all that they said with malicious intent. Why did they not come
to Him and say, “Since we admire thee in other respects, and thou
biddest us believe thee according to the Scriptures, tell us how it is
that the Scriptures say that Christ must come from Bethlehem, when thou
art come from Galilee?” But they said nothing of the kind, but all in
malice. And to show that they spoke not enquiringly, nor as desiring to
learn, the Evangelist straightway hath added, that,

<span id="iv.liii-p28"></span> [John
7.44](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#044.md)<span id="iv.liii-p28.1"></span> .
“Some of them would have taken Him, but no man laid his hand upon Him.”

<span id="iv.liii-p29"></span>This, if nothing else, might have been
sufficient to cause compunction in them, but they felt it not, as the
Prophet saith, “They were cleft asunder, and were not pricked in heart.”
( [Ps. xxxv. 15](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#015.md) <span
id="iv.liii-p29.1"></span> , LXX.)

<span id="iv.liii-p30"></span>\[3.\] Such a thing is malice! it will
give way to nothing, it looks to one thing only, and that is, to destroy
the person against whom it plotteth. But what saith the Scripture?
“Whoso diggeth a pit for his neighbor, shall fall into it himself.” (
[Prov. xxvi. 27](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#027.md) <span
id="iv.liii-p30.1"></span> .) Which was the case then. For they desired
to kill Him, to stop, as they thought, His preaching; the result was the
opposite. For the preaching flourishes by the grace of Christ, while all
that was theirs is quenched and perished; they have lost their country,
their freedom, their security, their worship, they have been deprived of
all their prosperity, and are become slaves and captives.

<span id="iv.liii-p31"></span>Knowing then this, let us never plot
against others, aware that by so doing we whet the sword against
ourselves, and inflict upon ourselves the deeper wound. Hath any one
grieved thee, and desireth thou to avenge thyself on him? Avenge not
thyself; so shalt thou be able to be avenged; but if thou avenge
thyself, thou art not avenged. Think not that this is a riddle, but a
true saying. “How, and in what way?” Because if thou avenge not thyself
on him, thou makest God his enemy; but if thou avenge thyself, no longer
so. “Vengeance is Mine, I will repay, saith the Lord.” ( [Rom. xii.
19](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#019) <span id="iv.liii-p31.1"></span> ..md)
For if we have servants, and they having quarreled  <span
id="fr_1441"></span>[1442](#fn_1441.md) with each other, do not give place
to us for judgment and for punishment, but take it upon themselves;
though they come to us ten thousand times, we not only shall not avenge
them, but shall even be wroth with them, saying, “Thou runaway, thou
flogging-post, thou oughtest to have submitted all to us, but since thou
hast prevented us and avenged thyself, trouble us no farther”; much more
shall God, who hath bidden us commit all unto Him, say this. For how can
it be otherwise than absurd, when we demand from our servants so much
minding of wisdom and obedience, but will not yield to our Master in
those matters in which we desire our domestics to yield to us? This I
say because of your readiness to inflict punishment one upon another.
The truly wise man ought not to do this even, but to pardon and forgive
offenses, though there were not that great reward proposed, the
receiving in return forgiveness. For, tell me, if thou condemnest one
who hath sinned, wherefore dost thou sin thyself, and fall into the same
fault? Hath he insulted? Insult not thou again, or thou hast insulted
thyself. Hath he struck? Strike not thou again, for then there is no
difference between you. Hath he vexed thee? Vex him not again, for the
profit is <span id="page_184">p. 184</span> <span
id="iv.liii-Page_184"></span> nothing, and thou wilt in thy turn be
placed on an equality with those who have wronged thee. Thus, if thou
bear with meekness and gentleness, thou shalt be able to reprove thine
enemy, to shame him, to weary  <span
id="fr_1442"></span>[1443](#fn_1442.md) him of being wroth. No man cures
evil with evil, but evil with good. These rules of wisdom give some of
the heathen; now if there be such wisdom among the foolish heathen, let
us be ashamed to show ourselves inferior to them. Many of them have been
injured, and have borne it; many have been maliciously accused, and not
defended themselves; have been plotted against, and have repaid by
benefits. And there is no small fear lest some of them be found in their
lives to be greater than we, and so render our punishment severer. For
when we who have partaken of the Spirit, we who look for the Kingdom,
who follow wisdom for the sake of heavenly things,  <span
id="fr_1443"></span>[1444](#fn_1443) who fear (not.md) hell, and are bidden
to become angels, who enjoy the Mysteries; when we reach not to the
virtue unto which they have attained, what pardon  <span
id="fr_1444"></span>[1445](#fn_1444.md) shall we have? If we must go beyond
the Jews, (for, “Except your righteousness shall exceed the
righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter
into the Kingdom of Heaven”— [Matt. v.
20](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#020) <span id="iv.liii-p35.3"></span> ,.md)
much more the heathen; if the Pharisees, much more the unbelievers.
Since if when we go not beyond the righteousness of the Jews, the
Kingdom is shut against us, how shall we be able to attain unto it when
we prove ourselves worse than the heathen? Let us then cast out all
bitterness, and wrath, and anger. To speak “the same things, to me
indeed is not grievous, but for you it is safe,” ( [Philip. iii.
1](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#001) <span id="iv.liii-p35.4"></span> ..md)
For physicians also often use the same remedy, and we will not cease
from sounding the same things in your ears, reminding, teaching,
exhorting, for great is the tumult of worldly things, and it causes in
us forgetfulness, and we have need of continual teaching. Let us then,
in order that we meet not together in this place uselessly and in vain,
exhibit the proof  <span id="fr_1445"></span>[1446](#fn_1445.md) which is
by works, that so we may obtain the good things to come, through the
grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom and with
whom, to the Father and the Holy Ghost be glory, now and ever and world
without end. Amen.
