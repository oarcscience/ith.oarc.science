<span id="iv.viii"></span> <span id="iv.viii-p0.1"></span>

<span id="iv.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c15"><span
id="iv.viii-p1.1"></span>Homily VI.</span>

<span id="iv.viii-p2"></span> <span id="iv.viii-p2.1"></span> <span
class="c1"><span id="iv.viii-p2.2"></span>[John i.
6](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#006.md)<span
id="iv.viii-p2.3"></span></span>

<span id="iv.viii-p3"></span>“There was a man sent from God, whose name
was John.”

<span id="iv.viii-p4"></span> \[1.\] <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.viii-p4.1"></span>Having</span> in the introduction spoken to us
things of urgent importance  <span id="fr_136"></span>[137](#fn_136.md)
concerning God the Word, (the Evangelist) proceeding on his road, and in
order, afterwards comes to the herald of the Word, his namesake John.
And now that thou hearest that he was “sent from God,” do not for the
future imagine that any of the words spoken by him are mere man’s words;
for all that he utters is not his own, but is of Him who sent him.
Wherefore he is called  <span id="fr_137"></span>[138](#fn_137.md)
“messenger” ( [Mal. iii. 1](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001.md) <span
id="iv.viii-p6.2"></span> ), for the excellence of a messenger is, that
he say nothing of his own. But the expression “was,” in this place is
not significative of his coming into existence, but refers to his office
of messenger; for “‘there was’ a man sent from God,” is used instead of
“a man ‘was sent’ from God.”

<span id="iv.viii-p7"></span> How then do some say,  <span
id="fr_138"></span>[139](#fn_138.md) that the expression, “being in the
form of God” ( [Philip. ii. 6](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#006.md) <span
id="iv.viii-p8.1"></span> ) is not <span id="page_26">p. 26</span> <span
id="iv.viii-Page_26"></span> used of His invariable likeness  <span
id="fr_139"></span>[140](#fn_139.md) to the Father, because no article is
added?  <span id="fr_140"></span>[141](#fn_140.md) For observe, that the
article is nowhere added here. Are these words then not spoken of the
Father? What then shall we say to the prophet who says, that, “Behold, I
send My messenger before Thy face, who shall prepare Thy way” ( [Mal.
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001.md), [Mark
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#002)<span id="iv.viii-p10.2"></span> .md)?
for the expressions “My” and “Thy” declare two Persons.

<span id="iv.viii-p11"></span> [John
1.7](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#007.md)<span id="iv.viii-p11.1"></span> .
“The same came for a witness, to bear witness of that Light.”

<span id="iv.viii-p12"></span> What is this, perhaps one may say, the
servant bear witness to his Master? When then you see Him not only
witnessed to by His servant, but even coming to him, and with Jews
baptized by him, will you not be still more astonished and perplexed?
Yet you ought not to be troubled nor confused, but amazed at such
unspeakable goodness. Though if any still continue bewildered  <span
id="fr_141"></span>[142](#fn_141.md) and confused, He will say to such an
one what He said to John, “Suffer it to be so now, for thus it becometh
us to fulfill all righteousness” ( [Matt. iii.
15](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#015) <span id="iv.viii-p13.3"></span> .md);
and, if any be still further troubled, again He will say to him too
 <span id="fr_142"></span>[143](#fn_142.md) what he said to the Jews, “But
I receive not testimony from man.” ( [John
5.34](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#034.md)<span id="iv.viii-p14.3"></span>
.) If now he needs not this witness, why was John sent from God? Not as
though He required his testimony—this were extremest blasphemy. Why
then? John himself informs us, when he says,

<span id="iv.viii-p15"></span>“That all men through him might believe.”

<span id="iv.viii-p16"></span>And Christ also, after having said that “I
receive not testimony from man” ( [John
5.34](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#034.md)<span id="iv.viii-p16.1"></span>
), in order that He may not seem to the foolish to clash with  <span
id="fr_143"></span>[144](#fn_143.md) Himself, by declaring at one time
“There is another that beareth witness of Me and I know that his  <span
id="fr_144"></span>[145](#fn_144.md) witness is true” ( [John.
5.32](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#032)<span id="iv.viii-p18.3"></span> .md)
(for He pointed to John;) and at another, “I receive not testimony from
man” ( [John 5.34](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#034.md)<span
id="iv.viii-p18.4"></span> ); He immediately adds the solution of the
doubt, “But these things I say” for your own sake,  <span
id="fr_145"></span>[146](#fn_145.md) “that ye might be saved.” As though He
had said, that “I am God, and the really-Begotten  <span
id="fr_146"></span>[147](#fn_146.md) Son of God, and am of that Simple and
Blessed Essence, I need none to witness to Me; and even though none
would do so, yet am not I by this anything diminished in My Essence; but
because I care for the salvation of the many,  <span
id="fr_147"></span>[148](#fn_147.md) I have descended to such humility as
to commit the witness of Me to a man.” For by reason of the groveling
nature and infirmity of the Jews, the faith in Him would in this way be
more easily received, and more palatable.  <span
id="fr_148"></span>[149](#fn_148.md) As then He clothed Himself with flesh,
that he might not, by encountering men with the unveiled Godhead,
destroy them all; so He sent forth a man for His herald, that those who
heard might at the hearing of a kindred voice approach more readily. For
(to prove) that He had no need of that (herald’s) testimony, it would
have sufficed that He should only have shown Himself who He was in His
unveiled Essence, and have confounded them all. But this He did not for
the reason I have before mentioned. He would have annihilated  <span
id="fr_149"></span>[150](#fn_149.md) all, since none could have endured the
encounter of that unapproachable light.  <span
id="fr_150"></span>[151](#fn_150.md) Wherefore, as I said, He put on flesh,
and entrusted the witness (of Himself) to one of our fellow-servants,
since He arranged  <span id="fr_151"></span>[152](#fn_151.md) all for the
salvation of men, looking not only to His own honor, but also to what
might be readily received by, and be profitable to, His hearers. Which
He glanced at when He said, “These things I say” for your sake, “that ye
might be saved.” ( [John 5.34](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#034.md)<span
id="iv.viii-p25.3"></span> .) And the Evangelist using the same language
as his Master, after saying, “to bear witness of that Light,” adds,

<span id="iv.viii-p26"></span> “That all men through Him might believe.”
All but saying, Think not that the reason why John the Baptist came to
bear witness, was that he might add aught to the trustworthiness of his
Master. No; (He came,) that by his means beings of his own class  <span
id="fr_152"></span>[153](#fn_152.md) might believe. For it is clear from
what follows, that he used this expression in his anxiety to remove this
suspicion beforehand, since he adds,

<span id="iv.viii-p28"></span> [John
1.8](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#008.md)<span id="iv.viii-p28.1"></span> .
“He was not that Light.”

<span id="iv.viii-p29"></span> Now if he did not introduce this as
setting himself against this suspicion, then the expression is
absolutely superfluous, and tautology rather than elucidation of his
teaching. For why, after having said that he “was sent to bear witness
of that Light,” does he again say, “He was not that Light”? (He says
it,) not loosely or without reason; but, because, for the most part,
among ourselves, the person witnessing is held to be greater, and
generally more trustworthy than the person witnessed of; therefore, that
none might suspect this in the case of John, at once from the very
beginning he removes this evil suspicion, and having torn it up by the
roots, shows who this is that bears witness, and who is He who is
witnessed of, and what an interval there is between the witnessed of,
and the bearer of witness. And after having done this, and shown His
incomparable superiority, he afterwards proceeds fearlessly to the
narrative which remains; and after carefully removing whatever strange
(ideas) might secretly harbor  <span id="fr_153"></span>[154](#fn_153.md)
in the <span id="page_27">p. 27</span> <span
id="iv.viii-Page_27"></span> minds of the simpler sort, so instills into
all  <span id="fr_154"></span>[155](#fn_154.md) easily and without
impediment the word of doctrine in its proper order.

<span id="iv.viii-p32"></span> Let us pray then, that henceforth with
the revelation of these thoughts and rightness of doctrine, we may have
also a pure life and bright conversation,  <span
id="fr_155"></span>[156](#fn_155.md) since these things profit nothing
unless good works be present with us. For though we have all faith and
all knowledge of the Scriptures, yet if we be naked and destitute of the
protection derived from (holy) living, there is nothing to hinder us
from being hurried into the fire of hell, and burning for ever in the
unquenchable flame. For as they who have done good shall rise to life
everlasting, so they who have dared the contrary shall rise to
everlasting punishment, which never has an end. Let us then manifest all
eagerness not to mar the gain which accrues to us from a right faith by
the vileness of our actions, but becoming well-pleasing to Him by these
also, boldly to look on Christ. No happiness can be equal to this. And
may it come to pass, that we all having obtained  <span
id="fr_156"></span>[157](#fn_156.md) what has been mentioned, may do all to
the glory of God; to whom, with the Only-Begotten Son and the Holy
Ghost, be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
