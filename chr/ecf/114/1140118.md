<span id="v.xxiv"></span> <span id="v.xxiv-p0.1"></span>

<span id="v.xxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c15"><span
id="v.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Homily XX.</span>

<span id="v.xxiv-p2"></span> <span id="v.xxiv-p2.1"></span> <span
class="c1"><span id="v.xxiv-p2.2"></span>[Heb.
10:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#026.md),
[27](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#027.md)<span
id="v.xxiv-p2.3"></span></span>

<span id="v.xxiv-p3"></span> *“For if we sin willfully, after we have
received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more*  <span
id="fr_3160"></span>[3161](#fn_3160.md) *sacrifice for sins, but a certain
fearful looking for of judgment, and fiery indignation*  <span
id="fr_3161"></span>[3162](#fn_3161.md) *which shall devour the
adversaries.”*

<span id="v.xxiv-p6"></span> \[1.\] <span class="c11"><span
id="v.xxiv-p6.1"></span>Trees</span> which have been planted, and have
had the advantage of all other care, and the hands and the labors of the
cultivator, and yet yield no return for the labors, are pulled up by the
roots, and handed over to the fire. So somewhat of this kind takes place
also in the case of our Illumination.  <span
id="fr_3162"></span>[3163](#fn_3162.md)  For when Christ has planted us,
and we have enjoyed the watering of the Spirit, and then show no fruit;
fire, even that of Hell, awaits us, and flame unquenchable.

<span id="v.xxiv-p8"></span>Paul therefore having exhorted them to love
and to bringing forth the fruit of good works, and having urged them
from the kindlier \[considerations\] (What are these? That we have an
entrance into the holy of holies, “the new way which He hath inaugurated
for us.”— [Heb. 10.20](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#020.md)<span
id="v.xxiv-p8.1"></span> ), does the same again from the more gloomy
ones, speaking thus. For having said, “not forsaking the assembling of
ourselves together, as the manner of some is, but exhorting  <span
id="fr_3163"></span>[3164](#fn_3163.md) one another, and so much the more,
as ye see the day approaching” ( [Heb.
10.25](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#025)<span id="v.xxiv-p9.2"></span> .md),
this being sufficient for consolation, he added, “For if we sin
willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth.” There is
need, he means, of good works, yea, very great need, “For if we sin
willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there
remaineth no more sacrifice for sins.” Thou wast cleansed; thou wast set
free from the charges against thee, thou hast become a son. If then thou
return to thy former vomit, there awaits thee on the other hand
excommunication and fire and whatever such things there are. For there
is no second sacrifice.

<span id="v.xxiv-p10"></span> \[2.\] At this place we are again assailed
by those who take away repentance,  <span
id="fr_3164"></span>[3165](#fn_3164.md) and by those who delay to come to
baptism. The one saying, that it is not safe for them to come to
baptism, since there is no second remission: And the other asserting
that it is not safe to impart the mysteries  <span
id="fr_3165"></span>[3166](#fn_3165.md) to those who have sinned, if there
is no second remission.

<span id="v.xxiv-p13"></span> What shall we say then to them both? That
he does not take away repentance, nor the propitiation through
repentance, nor does he thrust away and cast down with despair the
fallen. He is not thus an enemy of our salvation; but what? He takes
away the second Washing. For he did not say, no more  <span
id="fr_3166"></span>[3167](#fn_3166.md) is there repentance, or no more is
there remission, but “no more” is there a “sacrifice,” that is, there is
no more a second Cross.  <span id="fr_3167"></span>[3168](#fn_3167.md) For
this is what he means by sacrifice. “For by one sacrifice,” he says, “He
hath perfected forever them that are sanctified” ( [Heb.
10.14](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#014.md)<span id="v.xxiv-p15.2"></span>
); not like the Jewish \[rites.\]. For this reason he has treated so
much throughout concerning the Sacrifice, that it is one, even one; not
wishing to show this only, that herein it differed from the Jewish
\[rites\], but also to make \[men\] more steadfast, so that they might
no longer expect another sacrifice according to the Jewish law.

<span id="v.xxiv-p16"></span>“For,” saith he, “if we sin willfully.” See
how he is disposed to pardon. He says, “if we sin willfully,” so that
there is pardon for those \[who sin\] not willfully. “After the
knowledge of the truth”: He either means, of Christ, or of all
doctrines. “There remaineth no more sacrifice for sins,” but what? “A
certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation which
shall devour the adversaries.” By “Adversaries” he means not the
unbelievers, but those also who do what is against virtue; or \[else he
means\] that the same fire shall receive them of the household also,
which \[receives\] “the adversaries.” Then expressing its devouring
nature, he says, as if giving it life, “fiery indignation which shall
devour the adversaries.” For as a wild beast when irritated and very
fierce and savage, would <span id="page_458">p. 458</span> <span
id="v.xxiv-Page_458"></span> not rest till it could lay hold on some one
and eat him up; so also that fire, like one goaded by indignation,
whatever it can lay hold of does not let go, but devours and tears it to
pieces.

<span id="v.xxiv-p17"></span>\[3.\] Next he adds also the reason of the
threat, that it is on good grounds, that it is just; for this
contributes to confidence, when we show that it is just.

<span id="v.xxiv-p18"></span>For, he says, ( [Heb.
10.28](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#028)<span id="v.xxiv-p18.1"></span> .md)
“He that hath despised Moses’ law dies without mercy, under two or three
witnesses.” “Without mercy,” he says; so that there is no pardon, no
pity there although the law is of Moses; for he ordained the most of it.

<span id="v.xxiv-p19"></span>What is “under two or three”? If two or
three bore witness, he means, they immediately suffered punishment.

<span id="v.xxiv-p20"></span>If then under the Old \[Covenant\], when
the law of Moses is set at nought, there is so great punishment, ( [Heb.
10.29](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#029)<span id="v.xxiv-p20.1"></span> .md)
“Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy,
who hath trodden under foot the Son of God and hath counted the blood of
the covenant an unholy \[a common\] thing, and hath done despite unto
the Spirit of grace?”

<span id="v.xxiv-p21"></span> And how does a man “tread under foot the
Son of God”? When partaking of Him in the mysteries (he would say) he
has wrought sin, has he not trodden Him under foot? Has he not despised
Him? For just as we make no account of those who are trodden under foot,
so also, they who sin have made no account of Christ; and so they have
sinned. Thou art  <span id="fr_3168"></span>[3169](#fn_3168.md) become the
Body of Christ, and givest thou thyself to the devil, so that he treads
thee under foot.

<span id="v.xxiv-p23"></span>“And accounted the blood a common thing,”
he says. What is “common”? It is “unclean,” or the having nothing beyond
other things.

<span id="v.xxiv-p24"></span>“And done despite unto the Spirit of
grace.” For he that accepts not a benefit, does despite to the
benefactor. He made thee a son: and thou wishest to become a slave. He
came to dwell with thee, and thou bringest in wicked imaginations to
Him. Christ wished to stay with thee: and thou treadest Him down by
surfeiting, by drunkenness.

<span id="v.xxiv-p25"></span>Let us listen, whoever partake of the
mysteries unworthily: let us listen, whoever approach that Table
unworthily. “Give not” (He says) “that which is holy unto the dogs, lest
in time they trample them under their feet” ( [Matt. vii.
6](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#006) <span id="v.xxiv-p25.1"></span> .md),
that is, lest they despise, lest they repudiate \[them\]. Yet he did not
say this, but what was more fearful than this. For he constrains their
souls by what is fearful. For this also is adapted to convert, no less
than consolation. And at the same time he shows both the difference, and
the chastisement, and sets forth the judgment upon them, as though it
were an evident matter. “Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall
he be thought worthy?” Here also he appears to me to hint at the
mysteries.

<span id="v.xxiv-p26"></span>\[4.\] Next he adds testimony, saying, (
[Heb. 10:31](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#031.md),
[30](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#030)<span id="v.xxiv-p26.1"></span> .md)
“It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the Living God.” “For”
it is written: “Vengeance \[belongeth\] unto Me, I will recompense,
saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge His people.” “Let us
fall,” it is said, “into the hands of the Lord, and not into the hands
of men.” ( [Ecclesiasticus 2.18](../../../bib/apo/sir002.htm#018.md)<span
id="v.xxiv-p26.2"></span> .  <span id="fr_3169"></span>[3170](#fn_3169.md)
) But if ye repent not, ye shall “fall into the hands of” God: that is
fearful: it is nothing, to “fall into the hands of men.” When, he means,
we see any man punished here, let us not be terrified at the things
present, but shudder at the things to come. “For according to His mercy,
so is His wrath.”  <span id="fr_3170"></span>[3171](#fn_3170.md) And, “His
indignation will rest upon sinners.” ( [Ecclesiasticus
5.6](../../../bib/apo/sir005.htm#006)<span id="v.xxiv-p28.14"></span> ..md)

<span id="v.xxiv-p29"></span>At the same time too he hints at something
else. For “Vengeance \[belongeth\] unto Me,” he says, “I will
recompense.” This is said in regard to their enemies, who are doing
evil, not to those who are suffering evil. Here he is consoling them
too, all but saying, God abideth for ever and liveth, so that even if
they receive not \[their reward\] now, they will receive it hereafter.
They ought to groan, not we: for we indeed shall fall into their hands,
but they into the hands of God. For neither is it the sufferer who
suffers the ill, but he that does it; nor is it he who receives a
benefit that is benefited, but the benefactor.

<span id="v.xxiv-p30"></span>\[5.\] Knowing then these things, let us be
patient as to suffering evil, forward as to kindnesses. And this will
be, if we think lightly of wealth and honor. He that hath stripped
himself of those affections, is of all men most generous, and more
wealthy even than he who wears the purple. Seest thou not how many evils
come through money? I do not say how many through covetousness, but
merely by our attachment to these things. For instance, if a man has
lost his money, he leads a life more wretched than any death. Why
grievest thou, O man? why weepest thou? Because God has delivered Thee
from excessive watching? Because thou dost not sit trembling and
fearful? Again, if any one chain thee to a treasure, commanding thee to
sit there perpetually, and to keep watch for other people’s goods, thou
art grieved, thou art disgusted; and dost thou, after thou hast bound
thyself with most grievous chains, grieve when thou art delivered from
the slavery? <span id="page_459">p. 459</span> <span
id="v.xxiv-Page_459"></span> Truly sorrows and joys are \[matters\] of
fancy.  <span id="fr_3171"></span>[3172](#fn_3171.md) For we guard them as
if we had another’s.

<span id="v.xxiv-p32"></span>Now my discourse is for the women. A woman
often has a garment woven with gold, and this she shakes, wraps up in
linen, keeps with care, trembles for it, and has no enjoyment of it. For
either she dies, or she becomes a widow. Or, even if none of these
things happen, yet from fear lest wearing it out by continual use, she
should deprive herself of it, she deprives herself of it in another way,
by sparing it. But she passes it on \[you say\] to another. But neither
is this clear: and even if she should pass it on, the other again will
also use it in the same way. And if any one will search their houses, he
will find that the most costly garments and other choice things, are
tended with special honor, as if they were living masters. For she does
not use them habitually, but fears and trembles, driving away moths and
the other things that are wont to eat them, and laying most of them in
perfumes and spices, nor permitting all persons to be counted worthy of
the sight of them, but oftentimes carefully putting them in order
herself with her husband.

<span id="v.xxiv-p33"></span>Tell me: did not Paul with reason call
covetousness “idolatry”? ( [Col. iii.
5](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#005) <span id="v.xxiv-p33.1"></span> ..md)
For these show as great honor to their garments, their gold, as they to
their idols.

<span id="v.xxiv-p34"></span>\[6.\] How long shall we stir up the mire?
How long shall we be fixed to the clay and the brickmaking? For as they
toiled for the King of the Egyptians, so do we also toil for the devil,
and are scourged with far more grievous stripes. For by how much the
soul surpasses the body, by so much does anxiety the weals of scourging.
We are scourged every day, we are full of fear, in anxiety, in
trembling. But if we will groan, if we will look up to God, He sendeth
to us, not Moses, nor Aaron, but His own Word, and compunction. When
this \[word\] has come, and taken hold of our souls, He will free from
the bitter slavery, He will bring us forth out of Egypt, from
unprofitable and vain zeal, from slavery which brings no gain. For they
indeed went forth after having at least received golden \[ornaments\],
the wages for building, but we \[receive\] nothing: and would it were
nothing. For indeed we also receive, not golden ornaments, but the evils
of Egypt, sins and chastisements and punishments.

<span id="v.xxiv-p35"></span>Let us then learn to be made use of, let us
learn to be spitefully treated; this is the part of a Christian. Let us
think lightly of golden raiment, let us think lightly of money, that we
may not think lightly of our salvation. Let us think lightly of money
and not think lightly of the soul. For this is chastised, this is
punished: those things remain here, but the soul departeth yonder. Why,
tell me, dost thou cut thyself to pieces, without perceiving it?

<span id="v.xxiv-p36"></span>\[7.\] These things I say to the
overreaching. And it is well to say also to those who are overreached.
Bear their overreachings generously; they are ruining themselves, not
you. You indeed they defraud of your money, but they strip themselves of
the good will and help of God. And he that is stripped of that, though
he clothe himself with the whole wealth of the world, is of all men most
poor: and so he who is the poorest of all, if he have this, is the
wealthiest of all. For “the Lord” (it is said) “is my shepherd, and I
shall lack nothing.” ( [Ps. xxiii. 1](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#001.md)
<span id="v.xxiv-p36.1"></span> .)

<span id="v.xxiv-p37"></span>Tell me now, if thou hadst had a husband, a
great and admirable man, who thoroughly loved thee and cared for thee,
and then knewest that he would live always, and not die before thee, and
would give thee all things to enjoy in security, as thine own: wouldst
thou then have wished to possess anything? Even if thou hadst been
stripped of all, wouldst thou not have thought thyself the richer for
this?

<span id="v.xxiv-p38"></span>Why then dost thou grieve? Because thou
hast no property? But consider that thou hast had the occasion of sin
taken away. But is it because thou hadst \[property\] and hast been
deprived of it? But thou hast acquired the good will of God. And how
have I acquired it (you say)? He has said, “Wherefore do ye not rather
suffer wrong?” ( [1 Cor. vi. 7](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#007.md) <span
id="v.xxiv-p38.1"></span> .) He hath said, “Blessed are they who bear
all things with thankfulness.”  <span
id="fr_3172"></span>[3173](#fn_3172.md) Consider therefore how great good
will thou wilt enjoy, if thou showest forth those things by \[thy\]
works. For one thing only is required from us, “in all things to give
thanks” to God, and \[then\] we have all things in abundance. I mean,
for instance: hast thou lost ten thousand pounds of gold? Forthwith give
thanks unto God, and thou hast acquired ten times ten thousand, by that
word and thanksgiving.

<span id="v.xxiv-p40"></span>\[8.\] For tell me when dost thou account
Job blessed? When he had so many camels, and flocks, and herds, or when
he uttered that saying: “The Lord gave, the Lord hath taken away”? (
[Job i. 21](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#021.md) <span
id="v.xxiv-p40.1"></span> .) Therefore also the devil causes us losses,
not that he may take away our goods only, for he knows that is nothing,
but that through them he may compel us to utter some blasphemy. So in
the case of the blessed Job too, he did not strive after this only, to
make him poor, but also to make him a blasphemer. At any rate, when he
had stripped him of every <span id="page_460">p. 460</span> <span
id="v.xxiv-Page_460"></span> thing, observe what he says to him through
his wife, “Say some word against the Lord, and die.” ( [Job ii.
9](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#009) <span id="v.xxiv-p40.2"></span> ..md)
And yet, O accursed one, thou hadst stripped him of everything. ‘But’
(he says) ‘this is not what I was striving for; for I have not yet
accomplished that for which I did all. I was striving to deprive him of
God’s help: for this cause I deprived him of his goods too. This is what
I wish, that other is nothing. If this be not gained, he not only has
not been injured at all, but has even been benefited.’ Thou seest that
even that wicked demon knows how great is the loss in this matter?

<span id="v.xxiv-p41"></span>And see him plotting the treachery through
the wife. Hear this, ye husbands, as many as have wives that are fond of
money, and compel you to blaspheme God. Call Job to mind. But let us
see, if it please you, his great moderation, how he silenced her.
“Wherefore” (he says) “hast thou spoken as one of the foolish women
\[speaketh\]?” ( [Job ii. 10](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#010.md) <span
id="v.xxiv-p41.1"></span> .) Of a truth “evil communications corrupt
good manners” ( [1 Cor. xv. 33](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#033.md) <span
id="v.xxiv-p41.2"></span> ), at all times indeed, but particularly in
calamities: then they who give evil advice have strength. For if the
soul is even of itself prone to impatience, how much more, when there is
also an adviser. Is it not thrust into a pit? A wife is a great good, as
also a great evil. For because a wife is a great \[good\], observe from
what point he \[Satan\] wishes to break through the strong wall. ‘The
depriving him of his property’ (he says) ‘did not take him; the loss has
produced no great effect.’ Therefore he says, ‘If indeed he will curse
thee to thy face.’ ( [Job ii. 5](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#005.md) <span
id="v.xxiv-p41.3"></span> .) You see whither he was aspiring.  <span
id="fr_3173"></span>[3174](#fn_3173.md)

<span id="v.xxiv-p43"></span>If then we bear \[losses\] thankfully, we
shall recover even these things; and if we should not recover them, our
reward will be greater. For when he had wrestled nobly, then God
restored to him these things also. When He had shown the devil, that it
is not for these things that he serves Him, then He restored them also
to him.

<span id="v.xxiv-p44"></span>\[9.\] For such is He. When God sees that
we are not riveted to things of this life, then He gives them to us.
When He sees that we set a higher value on things spiritual, then He
also bestows on us things carnal. But not first, lest we should break
away from things spiritual: and to spare us He does not give carnal
things, to keep us away from them, even against our will.

<span id="v.xxiv-p45"></span>Not so (you say) but if I receive \[them\],
I am satisfied, and am the more thankful. It is false, O man, for then
especially wilt thou be thoughtless.

<span id="v.xxiv-p46"></span>Why then (you say) does He give \[them\] to
many? Whence is it clear, that He gives \[them\]? But who else, you say,
gives? Their overreaching, their plundering. How then does He allow
these things? As He also \[allows\] murders, thefts, and violence.

<span id="v.xxiv-p47"></span>What then (you will say) as to those who
receive by succession an inheritance from their fathers, being
themselves full of evils innumerable? And what of this? How does God
suffer them (you say) to enjoy these things? Surely just as He allows
thieves, and murderers, and other evil doers. For it is not now the time
of judgment, but of the best course of life.

<span id="v.xxiv-p48"></span>And what I just now said, that I repeat,
that they shall suffer greater punishment, who, when they have enjoyed
all good things, do not even so become better. For all shall not be
punished alike; but they who, even after His benefits, have continued
evil, shall suffer a greater punishment, while they who after poverty
\[have done this\] not so. And that this is true, hear what He says to
David, “Did I not give thee all thy master’s goods?” ( [2 Sam. xii.
8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#008) <span id="v.xxiv-p48.1"></span> ..md)
Whenever then thou seest a young man that has received a paternal
inheritance without labor and continues wicked, be assured that his
punishment is increased and the vengeance is made more intense.  Let us
not then emulate these; but if any man has succeeded to virtue, if any
man has obtained spiritual wealth, \[him let us emulate\]. For (it is
said) “Woe to them that trust in their riches” (cf. [Ps. xlix.
6](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#006) <span id="v.xxiv-p48.2"></span> .md):
“Blessed are they that fear the Lord.” ( [Ps. cxxviii.
1](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#001) <span id="v.xxiv-p48.3"></span> ..md)
To which of these, tell me, wouldst thou belong? Doubtless to those who
are pronounced blessed. Therefore emulate these, not the other, that
thou also mayest obtain the good things which are laid up for them.
Which may we all obtain, in Christ Jesus our Lord, with whom to the
Father be glory together with the Holy Ghost, now and for ever, and
world without end. Amen.
