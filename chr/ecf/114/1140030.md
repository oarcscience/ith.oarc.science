<span id="iv.xxvii-p3"></span>“Verily I say unto thee, Except a man be
born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of
God.”

<span id="iv.xxvii-p4"></span> \[1.\] <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.xxvii-p4.1"></span>Little</span> children who go daily to their
teachers receive their lessons, and repeat  <span
id="fr_637"></span>[638](#fn_637.md) them, and never cease from this kind
of acquisition, but sometimes employ nights as well as days, and this
they are compelled  <span id="fr_638"></span>[639](#fn_638.md) to do for
perishable and transient things. Now we do not ask of you who are come
to age such toil as you require of your children; for not every day, but
two days only in the week do we exhort you to hearken to our words, and
only for a short portion of the day, that your task may be an easy one.
For the same reason also we divide  <span
id="fr_639"></span>[640](#fn_639.md) to you in small portions what is
written in Scripture, that you may be able easily to receive and lay
them up in the storehouses of your minds, and take such pains to
remember them all, as to be able exactly to repeat them to others
yourselves, unless any one be sleepy, and dull, and more idle than a
little child.

<span id="iv.xxvii-p8"></span> Let us now attend to the sequel of what
has been before said. When Nicodemus fell into error and wrested the
words of Christ to the earthly birth, and said that it was not possible
for an old man to be born again, observe how Christ in answer more
clearly reveals the manner of the Birth, which even thus had difficulty
for the carnal enquirer, yet still was able to raise the hearer from his
low opinion of it. What saith He? “Verily I say unto thee, Except a man
be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of
God.” What He declares is this: “Thou sayest that it is impossible, I
say that it is so absolutely possible as to be necessary, and that it is
not even possible otherwise to be saved.” For necessary things God hath
made exceedingly easy also. The earthly birth which is according to the
flesh, is of the dust, and therefore heaven  <span
id="fr_640"></span>[641](#fn_640.md) is walled against it, for what hath
earth in common with heaven? But that other, which is of the Spirit,
easily unfolds to us the arches  <span id="fr_641"></span>[642](#fn_641.md)
above. Hear, ye as many as are unilluminated,  <span
id="fr_642"></span>[643](#fn_642.md) shudder, groan, fearful is the threat,
fearful the sentence.  <span id="fr_643"></span>[644](#fn_643.md) “It is
not (possible),” He saith, “for one not born of water and the Spirit, to
enter into the Kingdom of heaven”; because he wears the raiment of
death, of cursing, of perdition, he hath not yet received his Lord’s
token,  <span id="fr_644"></span>[645](#fn_644.md) he is a stranger and an
alien, he hath not the royal watchword. “Except,” He saith, “a man be
born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of
heaven.”

<span id="iv.xxvii-p14"></span> Yet even thus Nicodemus did not
understand. Nothing is worse than to commit spiritual things to
argument; it was this that would not suffer him to suppose anything
sublime and great. This is why we are called faithful, that having left
the weakness of human reasonings below,  <span
id="fr_645"></span>[646](#fn_645.md) we may ascend to the height of faith,
and commit most of our blessings to her  <span
id="fr_646"></span>[647](#fn_646.md) teaching;  <span
id="fr_647"></span>[648](#fn_647.md) and if Nicodemus had done this, the
thing would not have been thought by him impossible. What then doth
Christ? To lead him away from his groveling imagination, and to show
that He speaks not of the earthly birth, He saith, “Except a man be born
of water and of the Spirit he cannot enter into the Kingdom of heaven.”
This He spoke, willing to draw him to the faith by the terror of the
threat, and to persuade him not to deem the thing impossible, and taking
pains to move him from his imagination as to the carnal birth. “I mean,”
saith He, “another Birth, O Nicodemus. Why drawest thou down the saying
to earth? Why subjectest thou the matter to the necessity of nature?
This Birth is too high for such pangs as these; it hath nothing in
common with you; it is indeed called ‘birth,’ but in name only has it
aught in common, in reality it is different. Remove thyself from that
which is common and familiar; a different kind of childbirth bring I
into the world; in another manner will I have men to be generated: I
have come to bring a new manner of Creation. I formed (man) of earth and
water; but that which was formed was unprofitable, the vessel was
wrenched awry;  <span id="fr_648"></span>[649](#fn_648.md) I will no more
form them of earth and water, but ‘of water’ and ‘of the Spirit.’”

<span id="iv.xxvii-p19"></span> And if any one asks, “How *of water?* ”
I also will ask, How of earth? How was the clay separated into different
parts? How was the material uniform, (it was earth only,) and the things
made from it, various and of every kind? Whence are the bones, and
sinews, and arteries, and veins? Whence the membranes, and vessels of
the organs, the cartilages, the <span id="page_87">p. 87</span> <span
id="iv.xxvii-Page_87"></span> tissues, the liver, spleen, and heart?
whence the skin, and blood, and mucus, and bile? whence so great powers,
whence such varied colors? These belong not to earth or clay. How does
the earth, when it receives the seeds, cause them to shoot, while the
flesh receiving them wastes them? How does the earth nourish what is put
into it, while the flesh is nourished by these things, and does not
nourish them? The earth, for instance, receives water, and makes it
wine; the flesh often receives wine, and changes it into water. Whence
then is it clear that these things are formed of earth, when the nature
of the earth is, according to what has been said,  <span
id="fr_649"></span>[650](#fn_649.md) contrary to that of the body? I cannot
discover by reasoning, I accept it by faith only. If then things which
take place daily, and which we handle, require faith, much more do those
which are more mysterious and more spiritual than these. For as the
earth, which is soulless and motionless, was empowered by the will of
God, and such wonders were worked in it; much more when the Spirit is
present with the water, do all those things so strange and transcending
reason, easily take place.

<span id="iv.xxvii-p21"></span> \[2.\] Do not then disbelieve these
things, because thou seest them not; thou dost not see thy soul, and yet
thou believest that thou hast a soul, and that it is a something
different besides  <span id="fr_650"></span>[651](#fn_650.md) the body.

<span id="iv.xxvii-p23"></span> But Christ led him not in by this
example, but by another; the instance of the soul, though it is
incorporeal, He did not adduce for that reason, because His hearer’s
disposition was as yet too dull. He sets before him another, which has
no connection with the density of solid bodies, yet does not reach so
high as to the incorporeal natures; that is, the movement of wind. He
begins at first with water, which is lighter than earth, but denser than
air. And as in the beginning earth was the subject material,  <span
id="fr_651"></span>[652](#fn_651.md) but the whole  <span
id="fr_652"></span>[653](#fn_652.md) was of Him who molded it; so also now
water is the subject material, and the whole  <span
id="fr_653"></span>[654](#fn_653.md) is of the grace of the Spirit: then,
“man became a living soul,” ( [Gen. ii.
7](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#007) <span id="iv.xxvii-p26.1"></span> .md);
now he becomes “a quickening Spirit.” But great is the difference
between the two. Soul affords not life to any other than him in whom it
is; Spirit not only lives, but affords life to others also. Thus, for
instance, the Apostles even raised the dead. Then, man was formed last,
when the creation had been accomplished; now, on the contrary, the new
man is formed before the new creation; he is born first, and then the
world is fashioned anew. ( [1 Cor. xv.
45](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#045.md) <span id="iv.xxvii-p26.2"></span>
.) And as in the beginning He formed him entire, so He creates him
entire now. Then He said, “Let us make for him a help” ( [Gen. ii.
18](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#018.md) <span id="iv.xxvii-p26.3"></span> ,
LXX.), but here He said nothing of the kind. What other help shall he
need, who has received the gift of the Spirit? What further need of
assistance has he, who belongs to  <span
id="fr_654"></span>[655](#fn_654.md) the Body of Christ? Then He made man
in the image of God, now He hath united  <span
id="fr_655"></span>[656](#fn_655.md) him with God Himself; then He bade him
rule over the fishes and beasts, now He hath exalted our first-fruits
above the heavens; then He gave him a garden for his abode,  <span
id="fr_656"></span>[657](#fn_656.md) now He hath opened heaven to us; then
man was formed on the sixth day, when the world  <span
id="fr_657"></span>[658](#fn_657.md) was almost finished; but now on the
first, at the very beginning, at the time when light was made before.
From all which it is plain, that the things accomplished belonged to
 <span id="fr_658"></span>[659](#fn_658.md) another and a better life, and
to a condition  <span id="fr_659"></span>[660](#fn_659.md) having no end.

<span id="iv.xxvii-p33"></span> The first creation then, that of Adam,
was from earth; the next, that of the woman, from his rib; the next,
that of Abel, from seed; yet we cannot arrive at the comprehension of
 <span id="fr_660"></span>[661](#fn_660.md) any one of these, nor prove the
circumstances by argument, though they are of a most earthly nature;
 <span id="fr_661"></span>[662](#fn_661.md) how then shall we be able to
give account of the unseen  <span id="fr_662"></span>[663](#fn_662.md)
generation  <span id="fr_663"></span>[664](#fn_663.md) by Baptism, which is
far more exalted than these, or to require arguments  <span
id="fr_664"></span>[665](#fn_664.md) for that strange and marvelous Birth?
 <span id="fr_665"></span>[666](#fn_665.md) Since even Angels stand by
while that Generation takes place, but they could not tell the manner of
that marvelous working, they stand by only, not performing anything, but
beholding what takes place. The Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost,
worketh all. Let us then believe the declaration of God; that is more
trustworthy than actual seeing. The sight often is in error, it is
impossible that God’s Word should fail; let us then believe it; that
which called the things that were not into existence may well be trusted
when it speaks of their nature. What then says it? That what is effected
is <span class="c11"><span id="iv.xxvii-p39.2"></span>a
Generation</span> . If any ask, “How,” stop his mouth with the
declaration of God,  <span id="fr_666"></span>[667](#fn_666.md) which is
the strongest and a plain proof. If any enquire, “Why is water
included?” let us also in return ask, “Wherefore was earth employed at
the beginning in the creation of man?” for that it was possible for God
to make man without earth, is quite plain to every one. Be not then
over-curious.

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span> <span id="iv.xxvii-Page_88"></span>

<span id="iv.xxvii-p41"></span> That the need of water is absolute and
indispensable,  <span id="fr_667"></span>[668](#fn_667.md) you may learn in
this way. On one occasion, when the Spirit had flown down before the
water was applied, the Apostle did not stay at this point, but, as
though the water were necessary and not superfluous, observe what he
says; “Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized,
which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?” ( [Acts x.
47](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#047.md) <span id="iv.xxvii-p42.3"></span>
.)

<span id="iv.xxvii-p43"></span> What then is the use of the water? This
too I will tell you hereafter, when I reveal to you the hidden mystery.
 <span id="fr_668"></span>[669](#fn_668.md) There are also other points of
mystical teaching connected with the matter, but for the present I will
mention to you one out of many. What is this one? In Baptism are
fulfilled the pledges of our covenant with God;  <span
id="fr_669"></span>[670](#fn_669.md) burial and death, resurrection and
life; and these take place all at once. For when we immerse our heads in
the water, the old man is buried as in a tomb below, and wholly sunk
forever;  <span id="fr_670"></span>[671](#fn_670.md) then as we raise them
again, the new man rises in its stead.  <span
id="fr_671"></span>[672](#fn_671.md) As it is easy for us to dip and to
lift our heads again, so it is easy for God to bury the old man, and to
show forth the new. And this is done thrice, that you may learn that the
power of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost fulfilleth all this. To
show that what we say is no conjecture, hear Paul saying, “We are buried
with Him by Baptism into death”: and again, “Our old man is crucified
with Him”: and again, “We have been planted together in the likeness of
His death.” ( [Rom. 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#004.md),
[5](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#005.md),
[6](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#006)<span id="iv.xxvii-p47.2"></span> ..md)
And not only is Baptism called a “cross,” but the “cross” is called
“Baptism.” “With the Baptism,” saith Christ, “that I am baptized withal
shall ye be baptized” ( [Mark x. 39](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#039.md)
<span id="iv.xxvii-p47.3"></span> ): and, “I have a Baptism to be
baptized with” ( [Luke xii. 50](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#050.md) <span
id="iv.xxvii-p47.4"></span> ) (which ye know not); for as we easily dip
and lift our heads again, so He also easily died and rose again when He
willed or rather much more easily, though He tarried the three days for
the dispensation of a certain mystery.

<span id="iv.xxvii-p48"></span> \[3.\] Let us then who have been deemed
worthy of such mysteries show forth a life worthy of the Gift, that is,
a most excellent conversation;  <span id="fr_672"></span>[673](#fn_672.md)
and do ye who have not yet been deemed worthy, do all things that you
may be so, that we may be one body, that we may be brethren. For as long
as we are divided in this respect, though a man be father, or son, or
brother, or aught else, he is no true kinsman, as being cut off from
that relationship which is from above. What advantageth it to be bound
by the ties of earthly family, if we are not joined by those of the
spiritual? what profits nearness of kin on earth, if we are to be
strangers in heaven? For the Catechumen is a stranger to the Faithful.
He hath not the same Head, he hath not the same Father, he hath not the
same City, nor Food, nor Raiment, nor Table, nor House, but all are
different; all are on earth to the former, to the latter all are in
heaven. One has Christ for his King; the other, sin and the devil; the
food  <span id="fr_673"></span>[674](#fn_673.md) of one is Christ, of the
other, that meat which decays and perishes; one has worms’ work for his
raiment, the other the Lord of angels; heaven is the city of one, earth
of the other. Since then we have nothing in common, in what, tell me,
shall we hold communion? Did we remove the same pangs,  <span
id="fr_674"></span>[675](#fn_674.md) did we come forth from the same womb?
This has nothing to do with that most perfect relationship. Let us then
give diligence that we may become citizens of the city which is above.
How long do we tarry over the border,  <span
id="fr_675"></span>[676](#fn_675.md) when we ought to reclaim our ancient
country? We risk no common danger; for if it should come to pass, (which
God forbid!) that through the sudden arrival of death we depart hence
uninitiated,  <span id="fr_676"></span>[677](#fn_676.md) though we have ten
thousand virtues, our portion will be no other than hell, and the
venomous worm, and fire unquenchable, and bonds indissoluble. But God
grant that none of those who hear these words experience that
punishment! And this will be, if having been deemed worthy of the sacred
mysteries, we build upon that foundation gold, and silver, and precious
stones; for so after our departure hence we shall be able to appear in
that place rich, when we leave not our riches here, but transport them
to inviolable treasuries by the hands of the poor, when we lend to
Christ. Many are our debts there, not of money, but of sins; let us then
lend Him our riches, that we may receive pardon for our sins; for He it
is that judgeth. Let us not neglect Him here when He hungereth, that He
may ever feed us there. Here let us clothe Him, that He leave us not
bare of the safety which is from Him. If here we give Him drink, we
shall not with the rich man say, “Send Lazarus, that with the tip of his
finger he may drop water on my broiling  <span
id="fr_677"></span>[678](#fn_677.md) tongue.” If here we receive Him into
our house, there He will prepare many mansions for us; if we go to Him
in prison, He too will free us from our bonds; if we take Him in when He
is a stranger, He will not suffer us to be strangers to the Kingdom of
heaven, but will give us a portion in the City which is above; if we
visit Him when He is sick, He also will quickly deliver us from our
infirmities.

<span id="iv.xxvii-p55"></span>Let us then, as receiving great things
though <span id="page_89">p. 89</span> <span
id="iv.xxvii-Page_89"></span> we give but little, still give the little
that we may gain the great. While it is yet time, let us sow, that we
may reap. When the winter overtakes us, when the sea is no longer
navigable, we are no longer masters of this traffic. But when shall the
winter be? When that great and manifest Day is at hand. Then we shall
cease to sail this great and broad sea, for such the present life
resembles. Now is the time of sowing, then of harvest and of gain. If a
man puts not in his seed at seed time and sows in harvest, besides that
he effects nothing, he will be ridiculous. But if the present is seed
time, it follows that it is a time not for gathering together, but for
scattering; let us then scatter, that we may gather in, and not seek to
gather in now, lest we lose our harvest; for, as I said, this season
summons us to sow, and spend, and lay out, not to collect and lay by.
Let us not then give up the opportunity, but let us put in abundant
seed, and spare none of our stores, that we may receive them again with
abundant recompense, through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord
Jesus Christ, with whom to the Father and the Holy Ghost be glory, world
without end. Amen.
