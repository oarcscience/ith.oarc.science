<span id="iv.xl-p1"></span> <span class="c15"><span
id="iv.xl-p1.1"></span>Homily XXXVIII.</span>

<span id="iv.xl-p2"></span> <span id="iv.xl-p2.1"></span> <span
class="c1"><span id="iv.xl-p2.2"></span>[John v.
14](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#014.md)<span id="iv.xl-p2.3"></span></span>

<span id="iv.xl-p3"></span>“Afterward Jesus findeth him in the Temple,
and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole; sin no more, lest a
worse thing come unto thee.”

<span id="iv.xl-p4"></span> \[1.\] <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.xl-p4.1"></span> A fearful</span> thing is sin, fearful, and the
ruin of the soul, and the mischief oftentimes through its excess has
overflowed and attacked men’s bodies also. For since for the most part
when the soul is diseased we feel no pain, but if the body receive
though but a little hurt, we use every exertion to free it from its
infirmity, because we are sensible of the infirmity,  <span
id="fr_996"></span>[997](#fn_996.md) therefore God oftentimes punisheth the
body for the transgressions of the soul, so that by means of the
scourging of the inferior part, the better part also may receive some
healing. Thus too among the Corinthians Paul restored the adulterer,
checking the disease of the soul by the destruction of the flesh, and
having applied the knife to the body, so repressed the evil ( [1 Cor. v.
5](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#005) <span id="iv.xl-p5.3"></span> .md);
like some excellent physician employing external cautery for dropsy or
spleen, when they refuse to yield to internal remedies. This also Christ
did in the case of the paralytic; as He showed when He said, “Behold,
thou art made whole; sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.”

<span id="iv.xl-p6"></span> Now what do we learn from this? First, that
his disease had been produced by his sins; secondly, that the accounts
of hell fire are to be believed; thirdly, that the punishment is long,
nay endless. Where now are those who say, “I murdered in an hour, I
committed adultery in a little moment of time, and am I eternally
punished?” For behold this man had not sinned for so many years as he
suffered, for he had spent a whole lifetime in the length of his
punishment; and sins are not judged by time, but by the nature of the
transgressions. Besides this, we may see  <span
id="fr_997"></span>[998](#fn_997.md) another thing, that though we have
suffered severely for former sins, if we afterwards fall into the same,
we shall suffer much more severely. And with good reason; for he who is
not made better even by punishment, is afterwards led as insensible and
a despiser to still heavier chastisement. The fault should of itself be
sufficient to check and to render more sober the man who once has
slipped, but when not even the addition of punishment effects this, he
naturally requires more bitter torments.  <span
id="fr_998"></span>[999](#fn_998.md) Now if even in this world when after
punishment  <span id="fr_999"></span>[1000](#fn_999.md) we fall into the
same sins, we are chastised yet more severely then before, ought we not
when after sinning we have not been punished at all, to be then  <span
id="fr_1000"></span>[1001](#fn_1000.md) very exceedingly afraid and to
tremble, as being about to endure something irreparable? “And
wherefore,” saith some one, “are not all thus punished? for we see many
bad men well in body, vigorous, and enjoying great prosperity.” But let
us not be confident, let us mourn for them in this case most of all,
since their having suffered nothing here, helps them on  <span
id="fr_1001"></span>[1002](#fn_1001.md) to a severer vengeance hereafter.
 <span id="fr_1002"></span>[1003](#fn_1002.md) As Paul declares when he
saith, “But now that we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that
we should not be condemned with the world” ( [1 Cor. xi.
32](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#032) <span id="iv.xl-p12.3"></span> .md);
for the punishments here are for warning, there for vengeance.

<span id="iv.xl-p13"></span> “What then,” saith one, “do all diseases
proceed from sin?” Not all, but most of them; and some proceed from
different kinds of loose living,  <span
id="fr_1003"></span>[1004](#fn_1003.md) since gluttony, intemperance, and
sloth, <span id="page_131">p. 131</span> <span
id="iv.xl-Page_131"></span> produce such like sufferings. But the one
rule we have to observe, is to bear every stroke thankfully; for they
are sent because of our sins, as in the Kings we see one attacked by
gout ( [1 Kings xv. 23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#023.md) <span
id="iv.xl-p14.5"></span> ); they are sent also to make us approved, as
the Lord saith to Job, “Thinkest thou that I have spoken to thee, save
that thou mightest appear righteous?” ( Job lx. 8 <span
id="iv.xl-p14.6"></span> , LXX.)

<span id="iv.xl-p15"></span>But why is it that in the case of these
paralytics Christ bringeth forward their sins? For He saith also to him
in Matthew who lay on a bed, “Son, be of good cheer, thy sins are
forgiven thee” ( [Matt. ix. 2](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#002.md) <span
id="iv.xl-p15.1"></span> ): and to this man, “Behold, thou art made
whole; sin no more.”  <span id="fr_1004"></span>[1005](#fn_1004.md) I know
that some slander this paralytic, asserting that he was an accuser of
Christ, and that therefore this speech was addressed to him; what then
shall we say of the other in Matthew, who heard nearly the same words?
For Christ saith to him also, “Thy sins be forgiven thee.” Whence it is
clear, that neither was this man thus addressed on the account which
they allege. And this we may see more clearly from what follows;  <span
id="fr_1005"></span>[1006](#fn_1005.md) for, saith the Evangelist,
“Afterward Jesus findeth him in the Temple,” which is an indication of
his great piety; for he departed not into the market places and walks,
nor gave himself up to luxury and ease, but remained in the Temple,
although about to sustain so violent an attack and to be harassed by all
there.  <span id="fr_1006"></span>[1007](#fn_1006.md) Yet none of these
things persuaded him to depart from the Temple. Moreover Christ having
found him, even after he had conversed with the Jews, implied nothing of
the kind. For had He desired to charge him with this, He would have said
to him, “Art thou again attempting the same sins as before, art thou not
made better by thy cure?” Yet He said nothing of the kind, but merely
secureth him for the future.

<span id="iv.xl-p19"></span>\[2.\] Why then, when He had cured the halt
and maimed, did He not in any instance make mention of the like?
Methinks that the diseases of these (the paralytic) arose from acts of
sin, those of the others from natural infirmity. Or if this be not so,
then by means of these men, and by the words spoken to them, He hath
spoken to the rest also. For since this disease is more grievous than
any other, by the greater He correcteth also the less. And as when He
had healed a certain other He charged him to give glory to God,
addressing this exhortation not to him only but through him to all, so
He addresseth to these, and by these to all the rest of mankind, that
exhortation and advice which was given to them by word of mouth. Besides
this we may also say, that Jesus perceived great endurance in his soul,
and addressed the exhortation to him as to one who was able to receive
His command, keeping him to health both by the benefit, and by the fear
of future ills.

<span id="iv.xl-p20"></span> And observe the absence of boasting. He
said not, “Behold, I have made thee whole,” but, “Thou art made whole;
sin no more.” And again, not, “lest I punish thee,” but, “lest a worse
thing come unto thee”; putting both expressions not personally,  <span
id="fr_1007"></span>[1008](#fn_1007.md) and showing that the cure was
rather of grace than of merit. For He declared not to him that he was
delivered after suffering the deserved amount of punishment, but that
through lovingkindness he was made whole. Had this not been the case, He
would have said, “Behold, thou hast suffered a sufficient punishment for
thy sins, be thou steadfast for the future.” But now He spake not so,
but how? “Behold, thou art made whole; sin no more.” Let us continually
repeat these words to ourselves, and if after having been chastised we
have been delivered, let each say to himself, “Behold, thou art made
whole; sin no more.” But if we suffer not punishment though continuing
in the same courses, let us use for our charm that word of the Apostle,
“The goodness of God leadeth \[us\] to repentance, but after \[our\]
hardness and impenitent heart, \[we\] treasure up unto \[ourselves\]
wrath.” ( [Rom. 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#004.md),
[5](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#005)<span id="iv.xl-p21.4"></span> ..md)

<span id="iv.xl-p22"></span> And not only by strengthening  <span
id="fr_1008"></span>[1009](#fn_1008.md) the sick man’s body, but also in
another way, did He afford him a strong proof of His Divinity; for by
saying, “Sin no more,” He showed that He knew all the transgressions
that had formerly been committed by him; and by this He would gain his
belief as to the future.

<span id="iv.xl-p24"></span> [John
5.15](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#015.md)<span id="iv.xl-p24.1"></span> .
“The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus that had made him
whole.”

<span id="iv.xl-p25"></span> Again observe him continuing in the same
right feeling. He saith not, “This is he who said, Take up thy bed,” but
when they continually advanced this seeming charge, he continually puts
forward the defense, again declaring his Healer, and seeking to attract
and attach others to Him. For he was not so unfeeling as after such a
benefit and charge to betray his Benefactor, and to speak as he did with
an evil intention. Had he been a wild beast, had he been something
unlike a man and of stone, the benefit and the fear would have been
enough to restrain him, since, having the threat lodged within, he would
have dreaded lest he should suffer “a worse thing,” having already
received the greatest pledges  <span
id="fr_1009"></span>[1010](#fn_1009.md) of the power of his Physician.
Besides, had he wished to slander Him, he would have said nothing about
his own cure, but would have mentioned and urged against Him the breach
of the Sabbath. But this is not the case, surely it is not; the words
are words of great boldness and candor; he pro <span id="page_132">p.
132</span> <span id="iv.xl-Page_132"></span> claims his Benefactor no
less than the blind man did. For what said he? “He made clay, and
anointed mine eyes” ( [John 9.6](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#006.md)<span
id="iv.xl-p26.3"></span> ); and so this man of whom we now speak, “It is
Jesus who made me whole.”

<span id="iv.xl-p27"></span> [John
5.16](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#016.md)<span id="iv.xl-p27.1"></span> .
“Therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay Him, because
He had done these things on the Sabbath day.” What then saith Christ?

<span id="iv.xl-p28"></span> [John
5.17](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#017.md)<span id="iv.xl-p28.1"></span> .
“My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.”

<span id="iv.xl-p29"></span>When there was need to make excuse for the
Disciples, He brought forward David their fellow-servant, saying, “Have
ye not read what David did when he was an hungered?” ( [Matt. xii.
2](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#002) <span id="iv.xl-p29.1"></span> ..md)
But when excuse was to be made for Himself, He betook Himself to the
Father, showing in two ways His Equality, by calling God His Father
peculiarly,  <span id="fr_1010"></span>[1011](#fn_1010.md) and by doing the
same things which He did. “And wherefore did He not mention what took
place at Jericho  <span id="fr_1011"></span>[1012](#fn_1011.md) ?” Because
He wished to raise them up from earth that they might no longer attend
to Him as to a man, but as to God, and as to one who ought to legislate:
since had He not been The Very Son and of the same Essence, the defense
would have been worse than the charge. For if a viceroy who had altered
a royal law should, when charged with so doing, excuse himself in this
manner, and say, “Yea, for the king also has annulled laws,” he would
not be able to escape, but would thus increase the weight of the charge.
But in this instance, since the dignity is equal, the defense is made
perfect on most secure grounds. “From the charges,” saith He, “from
which ye absolve God, absolve Me also.” And therefore He said first, “My
Father,” that He might persuade them even against their will to allow to
Him the same, through reverence of His clearly asserted Sonship.

<span id="iv.xl-p32"></span> If any one say, “And how doth the Father
‘work,’ who ceased on the seventh day from all His works?” let him learn
the manner in which He “worketh.” What then is the manner of His
working? He careth for, He holdeth  <span
id="fr_1012"></span>[1013](#fn_1012.md) together all that hath been made.
Therefore when thou beholdest the sun rising and the moon running in her
path, the lakes, and fountains, and rivers, and rains, the course of
nature in the seeds and in our own bodies and those of irrational
beings, and all the rest by means of which this universe is made up,
then learn the ceaseless working of the Father. “For He maketh His sun
to rise upon the evil and the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on
the unjust.” ( [Matt. v. 45](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#045.md) <span
id="iv.xl-p33.7"></span> .) And again; “If God so clothe the grass of
the field, which to-day is, and to-morrow is cast into the fire  <span
id="fr_1013"></span>[1014](#fn_1013.md) ” ( [Matt. vi.
30](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#030) <span id="iv.xl-p34.3"></span> .md);
and speaking of the birds He said, “Your Heavenly Father feedeth them.”

<span id="iv.xl-p35"></span> \[3.\] In that place  <span
id="fr_1014"></span>[1015](#fn_1014.md) then He did all on the Sabbath day
by words only, and added nothing more, but refuted their charges by what
was done in the Temple and from their own practice. But here where He
commanded a work to be done, the taking up a bed, (a thing of no great
importance as regarded the miracle,  <span
id="fr_1015"></span>[1016](#fn_1015.md) though by it He showed one point, a
manifest violation of the Sabbath,) He leads up His discourse to
something greater, desiring the more to awe them by reference to the
dignity of the Father, and to lead them up to higher thought. Therefore
when His discourse is concerning the Sabbath, He maketh not His defense
as man only, or as God only, but sometimes in one way, sometimes in the
other; because He desired to persuade them both of the condescension of
the Dispensation, and the Dignity of His Godhead. Therefore He now
defendeth Himself as God, since had He always conversed with them merely
as a man, they would have continued in the same low condition. Wherefore
that this may not be, He bringeth forward the Father. Yet the creation
itself “worketh” on the Sabbath, (for the sun runneth, rivers flow,
fountains bubble, women bear,) but that thou mayest learn that He is not
of creation, He said not, “Yea, I work, for creation worketh,” but,
“Yea, I work, for My Father worketh.”

<span id="iv.xl-p38"></span> [John
5.18](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#018.md)<span id="iv.xl-p38.1"></span> .
“Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill Him, because He not only had
broken the Sabbath, but said also that God was His Father, making
Himself equal with God.”

<span id="iv.xl-p39"></span>And this he asserted not by words merely,
but by deeds, for not in speech alone, but also yet oftener by actions
He declared it. Why so? Because they might object to His words and
charge Him with arrogance, but when they saw the truth of His actions
proved by results, and His power proclaimed by works, after that they
could say nothing against Him.

<span id="iv.xl-p40"></span>But they who will not receive these words in
a right mind assert, that “Christ made not Himself equal to God, but
that the Jews suspected this.” Come then let us go over what has been
said from the beginning. Tell me, did the Jews persecute Him, or did
they not? It is clear to every one that they did. Did they persecute Him
for this or for something else? It is again allowed that it was for
this. Did He then break the Sabbath, or did He not? Against the fact
that He did, no one can have anything to say. Did He call God His
Father, or did He not call Him so? This too is true. Then the rest also
<span id="page_133">p. 133</span> <span id="iv.xl-Page_133"></span>
follows by the same consequence; for as to call God His Father, to break
the Sabbath, and to be persecuted by the Jews for the former and more
especially for the latter reason, belonged not to a false imagination,
but to actual fact, so to make Himself equal to God was a declaration of
the same meaning.  <span id="fr_1016"></span>[1017](#fn_1016.md)

<span id="iv.xl-p42"></span> And this one may see more clearly from what
He had before said, for “My Father worketh, and I work,” is the
expression of One declaring Himself equal to God. For in these words He
has marked  <span id="fr_1017"></span>[1018](#fn_1017.md) no difference. He
said not, “He worketh, and I minister,” but, “As He worketh, so work I”;
and hath declared absolute Equality. But if He had not wished to
establish this, and the Jews had supposed so without reason, He would
not have allowed their minds to be deceived, but would have corrected
this. Besides, the Evangelist would not have been silent on the subject,
but would have plainly said that the Jews supposed so, but that Jesus
did not make Himself equal to God. As in another place he doth this very
thing, when he perceiveth that something was said in one way, and
understood in another; as, “Destroy this Temple,” said Christ, “and in
three days I will raise It up” ( [John
2.19](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#019)<span id="iv.xl-p43.3"></span> .md);
speaking of His Flesh. But the Jews, not understanding this, and
supposing that the words were spoken of the Jewish Temple, said, “Forty
and six years was this temple in building, and wilt Thou rear it up in
three days?” Since then He said one thing, and they imagined another,
(for He spake of His Flesh, and they thought that the words were spoken
of their Temple,) the Evangelist remarking on this, or rather correcting
their imagination, goes on to say, “But He spake of the Temple of His
Body.” So that here also, if Christ had not made Himself equal with God,
had not wished to establish this, and yet the Jews had imagined that He
did, the writer would here also have corrected their supposition, and
would have said, “The Jews thought that He made Himself equal to God,
but indeed He spake not of equality.” And this is done not in this place
only, nor by this Evangelist only, but again elsewhere another
Evangelist is seen to do the same. For when Christ warned His disciples,
saying, “Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees” ( [Matt.
xvi. 6](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#006.md) <span id="iv.xl-p43.4"></span>
), and they reasoned among themselves, saying, “It is because we have
taken no bread,” and He spake of one thing, calling their doctrine
“leaven,” but the disciples imagined another, supposing that the words
were said of bread; it is not now the Evangelist who setteth them right,
but Christ Himself, speaking thus, “How is it that ye do not understand,
that I spake not to you concerning bread?” But here there is nothing of
the kind.

<span id="iv.xl-p44"></span>“But,” saith some one, “to remove this very
thought Christ has added,

<span id="iv.xl-p45"></span> [John
5.19](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#019.md)<span id="iv.xl-p45.1"></span> .
“‘The Son can do nothing of Himself.’”

<span id="iv.xl-p46"></span> Man! He doth the contrary. He saith this
not to take away, but to confirm,  <span
id="fr_1018"></span>[1019](#fn_1018.md) His Equality. But attend carefully,
for this is no common question. The expression “of Himself” is found in
many places of Scripture, with reference both to Christ and to the Holy
Ghost, and we must learn the force of the expression, that we may not
fall into the greatest errors; for if one take it separately by itself
in the way in which it is obvious to take it, consider how great an
absurdity will follow. He said not that He could do some things of
Himself and that others He could not, but universally,

<span id="iv.xl-p48"></span>\[4.\] “The Son can do nothing of Himself.”
I ask then my opponent, “Can the Son do nothing of Himself, tell me?” If
he reply, “that He can do nothing,” we will say, that He hath done of
Himself the very greatest of all goods. As Paul cries aloud, saying,
“Who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with
God, but made Himself of no reputation, and took upon Him the form of a
servant.” ( [Phil. 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#006.md),
[7](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007)<span id="iv.xl-p48.1"></span> ..md) 
And again, Christ Himself in another place saith, “I have power to lay
down My life, and I have power to take it again”: and, “No man taketh it
from Me, but I lay it down of Myself.” ( [John
10.18](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#018.md)<span id="iv.xl-p48.2"></span>
.)  Seest thou that He hath power over life and death, and that He
wrought of Himself so mighty a Dispensation? And why speak I concerning
Christ, when even we, than whom nothing can be meaner, do many things of
ourselves? Of ourselves we choose vice, of ourselves we go after virtue,
and if we do it not of ourselves, and not having power, we shall neither
suffer hell if we do wrong, nor enjoy the Kingdom if we do right.

<span id="iv.xl-p49"></span> What then meaneth, “Can do nothing of
Himself”? That He can do nothing in opposition to the Father, nothing
alien from, nothing strange to Him,  <span
id="fr_1019"></span>[1020](#fn_1019.md) which is especially the assertion
of One declaring an Equality and entire agreement.

<span id="iv.xl-p51"></span> But wherefore said He not, that “He doeth
nothing contrary,” instead of, “He cannot do”? It was that from this
again He might show the invariableness and exactness of the Equality,
for the expression imputes not weakness to Him, but even shows  <span
id="fr_1020"></span>[1021](#fn_1020.md) His great power; since in another
place Paul saith of the Father, “That by two immutable things in which
it was impos <span id="page_134">p. 134</span> <span
id="iv.xl-Page_134"></span> sible for God to lie” ( [Heb. vi.
18](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#018) <span id="iv.xl-p52.3"></span> .md):
and again, “If we deny Him — He abideth faithful,” for “He cannot deny
Himself.” ( [2 Tim. 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#012.md),
[13](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#013)<span id="iv.xl-p52.4"></span> ..md)
And in truth this expression, “impossible,” is not declaratory of
weakness, but power, power unspeakable. For what He saith is of this
kind, that “that Essence admitteth not such things as these.” For just
as when we also say, “it is impossible for God to do wrong,” we do not
impute to Him any weakness, but confess in Him an unutterable power; so
when He also saith, “I can of Mine own Self do nothing” ( [John
5.30](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#030)<span id="iv.xl-p52.5"></span> .md),
His meaning is, that “it is impossible, nature admits not,  <span
id="fr_1021"></span>[1022](#fn_1021.md) that I should do anything contrary
to the Father.” And that you may learn that this is really what is said,
let us, going over what follows, see whether Christ agreeth with what is
said by us, or among you. Thou sayest, that the expression does away
with His Power and His proper Authority, and shows His might to be but
weak; but I say, that this proves His Equality, His unvarying Likeness,
 <span id="fr_1022"></span>[1023](#fn_1022) (to the Father,.md) and the
fact that all is done as it were by one Will  <span
id="fr_1023"></span>[1024](#fn_1023.md) and Power and Might. Let us then
enquire of Christ Himself, and see by what He next saith whether He
interpreteth these words according to thy supposition or according to
ours. What then saith He?

<span id="iv.xl-p56"></span> “For what things soever the Father  <span
id="fr_1024"></span>[1025](#fn_1024.md) doeth these also doeth the Son
likewise.”

<span id="iv.xl-p58"></span> Seest thou how He hath taken away your
assertion by the root, and confirmed what is said by us? since, if
Christ doeth nothing of Himself, neither will the Father do anything of
Himself, if so be that Christ doeth all things in like manner to Him.
 <span id="fr_1025"></span>[1026](#fn_1025.md) If this be not the case,
another strange conclusion will follow. For He said not, that
“whatsoever things He saw the Father do, He did,” but, “except He see
the Father doing anything, He doeth it not”; extending His words to all
time; now He will, according to you, be continually learning the same
things. Seest thou how exalted is the idea, and that the very humility
of the expression compelleth even the most shameless and unwilling to
avoid groveling thoughts, and such as are unsuited to His dignity? For
who so wretched and miserable as to assert, that the Son learneth day by
day what He must do? and how can that be true, “Thou art the same, and
Thy years shall not fail”? ( [Ps. cii.
27](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#027) <span id="iv.xl-p59.8"></span> .md),
or that other, “All things were made by Him, and without Him was not
anything made” ( [John 1.3](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#003.md)<span
id="iv.xl-p59.9"></span> ); if the Father doeth certain things, and the
Son seeth and imitateth Him? Seest thou that from what was asserted
above, and from what was said afterwards, proof is given of His
independent Power? and if He bringeth forward some expressions in lowly
manner, marvel not, for since they persecuted Him when they had heard
His exalted sayings, and deemed Him to be an enemy of God, sinking
 <span id="fr_1026"></span>[1027](#fn_1026.md) a little in expression
alone, He again leadeth His discourse up to the sublimer doctrines, then
in turn to the lower, varying His teaching that it might be easy of
acceptance even to the indisposed.  <span
id="fr_1027"></span>[1028](#fn_1027.md) Observe, after saying, “My Father
worketh, and I work”; and after declaring Himself equal with God, He
addeth, “The Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He seeth the Father
do.” Then again in a higher strain, “What things soever the Father
doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.” Then in a lower,

<span id="iv.xl-p62"></span> [John
5.20](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#020.md)<span id="iv.xl-p62.1"></span> .
“The Father loveth the Son, and showeth Him all things that Himself
doeth; and He will show Him greater works than these.”

<span id="iv.xl-p63"></span>Seest thou how great is the humility of
this? And with reason; for what I said before, what I shall not cease to
say, I will now repeat, that when He uttereth anything low or humbly, He
putteth it in excess, that the very poverty of the expression may
persuade even the indisposed to receive the notions with pious
understanding. Since, if it be not so, see how absurd a thing is
asserted, making the trial from the words themselves. For when He saith,
“And shall show Him greater works than these,” He will be found not to
have yet learned many things, which cannot be said even of the Apostles;
for they when they had once received the grace of the Spirit, in a
moment both knew and were able to do all things which it was needful
that they should know and have power to do, while Christ will be found
to have not yet learned many things which He needed to know. And what
can be more absurd than this?

<span id="iv.xl-p64"></span> What then is His meaning? It was because He
had strengthened the paralytic, and was about to raise the dead, that He
thus spake, all but saying, “Wonder ye that I have strengthened the
paralyzed? Ye shall see greater things than these.” But He spake not
thus, but proceeded somehow in a humbler strain, in order that He might
soothe  <span id="fr_1028"></span>[1029](#fn_1028.md) their madness. And
that thou mayest learn that “shall show” is not used absolutely, listen
again to what followeth.

<span id="iv.xl-p66"></span> [John
5.21](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#021.md)<span id="iv.xl-p66.1"></span> .
“For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them, even so the
Son quickeneth whom He will.”

<span id="iv.xl-p67"></span>Yet “can do nothing of Himself” is opposed
to “whom He will”: since if He quickeneth “whom He will,” He can do
something “of Himself,” (for to “will” implies power,) but if He “can do
nothing of Himself,” then He can <span id="page_135">p. 135</span> <span
id="iv.xl-Page_135"></span> not “quicken whom He will.” For the
expression, “as the Father raiseth up,” showeth unvarying resemblance in
Power, and “whom He will,” Equality of Authority. Seest thou therefore
that “cannot do anything of Himself” is the expression of One not taking
away His (own) authority, but declaring the unvarying resemblance of His
Power and Will (to those of the Father)? In this sense also understand
the words, “shall show to Him”; for in another place He saith, “I will
raise him up at the last Day.” ( [John
6.40](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#040)<span id="iv.xl-p67.1"></span> ..md) 
And again, to show that He doth it not by receiving an inward power
 <span id="fr_1029"></span>[1030](#fn_1029.md) from above, He saith, “I am
the Resurrection and the Life.” ( [John
11.25](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#025)<span id="iv.xl-p68.3"></span> ..md)
Then that thou mayest not assert that He raiseth what dead He will and
quickeneth them, but that He doth not other things in such manner, He
anticipateth and preventeth every objection of the kind by saying, “What
things soever He doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise,” thus
declaring that He doeth all things which the Father doeth, and as the
Father doeth them; whether thou speakest of the raising of the dead, or
the fashioning  <span id="fr_1030"></span>[1031](#fn_1030.md) of bodies, or
the remission of sins, or any other matter whatever, He worketh in like
manner to Him who begat Him.

<span id="iv.xl-p70"></span> \[5.\] But men careless of their salvation
give heed to none of these things; so great an evil is it to be in love
with precedence. This has been the mother of heresies, this has
confirmed the impiety of the heathen.  <span
id="fr_1031"></span>[1032](#fn_1031.md) For God desired that His invisible
things should be understood by the creation of this world ( [Rom. i.
20](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#020) <span id="iv.xl-p71.3"></span> .md),
but they having left these and refused to come by this mode of teaching,
cut out for themselves another way, and so were cast out from the true.
 <span id="fr_1032"></span>[1033](#fn_1032.md) And the Jews believed not
because they received honor from one another, and sought not the honor
which is from God. But let us, beloved, avoid this disease exceedingly
and with all earnestness; for though we have ten thousand good
qualities, this plague of vainglory is sufficient to bring them all to
nought. ( [John 5.44](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#044.md)<span
id="iv.xl-p72.5"></span> .) If therefore we desire praise, let us seek
the praise which is from God, for the praise of men of what kind soever
it be, as soon as it has appeared has perished, or if it perish not,
brings to us no profit, and often proceeds from a corrupt judgment. And
what is there to be admired in the honor which is from men? which young
dancers enjoy, and abandoned women, and covetous and rapacious men? But
he who is approved of God, is approved not with these, but with those
holy men the Prophets and Apostles, who have shown forth an angelic
life. If we feel any desire to lead multitudes about with us or be
looked at by them, let us consider the matter apart by itself, and we
shall find that it is utterly worthless. In fine, if thou art fond of
crowds, draw to thyself the host of angels, and become terrible to the
devils, then shalt thou care nothing for mortal things, but shalt tread
all that is splendid underfoot as mire and clay; and shall clearly see
that nothing so fits a soul for shame as the passion for glory; for it
cannot, it cannot be, that the man who desires this should live the
crucified life, as on the other hand it is not possible that the man who
hath trodden this underfoot should not tread down most other passions;
for he who masters this will get the better of envy and covetousness,
and all the grievous maladies. “And how,” saith some one, “shall we get
the better of it?” If we look to the other glory which is from heaven,
and from which this kind strives to cast us out. For that heavenly glory
both makes us honored here, and passes with us into the life which is to
come, and delivers us from all fleshly slavery which we now most
miserably serve, giving up ourselves entirely to earth and the things of
earth. For if you go into the forum, if you enter into a house, into the
streets, into the soldiers’ quarters, into inns, taverns, ships,
islands, palaces, courts of justice, council chambers, you shall
everywhere find anxiety for things present and belonging to this life,
and each man laboring for these things, whether gone or coming,
traveling or staying at home, voyaging, tilling lands, in the fields, in
the cities, in a word, all. What hope then of salvation have we, when
inhabiting God’s earth we care not for the things of God, when bidden to
be aliens from earthly things we are aliens from heaven and citizens of
earth? What can be worse than this insensibility, when hearing each day
of the Judgment and of the Kingdom, we imitate the men in the days of
Noah, and those of Sodom, waiting to learn all by actual experience? Yet
for this purpose were all those things written, that if any one believe
not that which is to come, he may, from what has already been, get
certain proof of what shall be. Considering therefore these things, both
the past and the future, let us at least take breath a little from this
hard slavery, and make some account of our souls also,  <span
id="fr_1033"></span>[1034](#fn_1033.md) that we may obtain both present and
future blessings; through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus
Christ, to whom, with the Father and the Holy Ghost, be glory, now and
ever, and world without end. Amen.
