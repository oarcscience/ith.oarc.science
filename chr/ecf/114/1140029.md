<span id="iv.xxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c15"><span
id="iv.xxvi-p1.1"></span>Homily XXIV.</span>

<span id="iv.xxvi-p2"></span> <span id="iv.xxvi-p2.1"></span> <span
class="c1"><span id="iv.xxvi-p2.2"></span>[John ii.
23](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#023)<span
id="iv.xxvi-p2.3"></span></span>

<span id="iv.xxvi-p3"></span>“Now when He was in Jerusalem at the
Passover, in the feast, many believed on Him.”

<span id="iv.xxvi-p4"></span> \[1.\] <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.xxvi-p4.1"></span>Of</span> the men of that time some clung to
their error, others laid hold on the truth, while of these last, some
having retained it for a little while again fell off from it. Alluding
to these, Christ compared them to seeds not deeply sown, but having
their roots upon the surface of the earth; and He said that they should
quickly perish. And these the Evangelist has here pointed out to us,
saying,

<span id="iv.xxvi-p5"></span> “When He was in Jerusalem, at the
Passover, in the feast, many believed on Him,  <span
id="fr_611"></span>[612](#fn_611) when they saw the miracles which He
did.”

<span id="iv.xxvi-p7"></span> [John
2.24](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#024)<span id="iv.xxvi-p7.1"></span> .
“But Jesus did not commit Himself unto them.”

<span id="iv.xxvi-p8"></span> For they were the more perfect  <span
id="fr_612"></span>[613](#fn_612) among His disciples, who came to Him
not only because of His miracles, but through His teaching also. The
grosser sort the miracles attracted, but the better reasoners His
prophecies and doctrines; and so they who were taken by His teaching
were more steadfast than those attracted by His miracles. And Christ
also called them “blessed,” saying, “Blessed are they that have not
seen, and yet have believed.” ( [John
20.29](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#029)<span id="iv.xxvi-p9.5"></span>
.) But that these here mentioned were not real disciples, the following
passage shows, for it saith, “Jesus did not commit Himself unto them.”
Wherefore?

<span id="iv.xxvi-p10"></span> “Because He knew all things,”  <span
id="fr_613"></span>[614](#fn_613)

<span id="iv.xxvi-p12"></span> [John
2.25](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#025)<span id="iv.xxvi-p12.1"></span> .
“And needed not that any should testify of man, for He knew what was in
man.”

<span id="iv.xxvi-p13"></span>The meaning is of this kind. “He who
dwells in men’s hearts, and enters into their thoughts, took no heed of
outward words; and knowing well that their warmth was but for a season,
He placed not confidence in them as in perfect disciples, nor committed
all His doctrines to them as though they had already become firm
believers.” Now, to know what is in the heart of men belongs to God
alone, “who hath fashioned hearts one by one” ( [Ps. xxxiii.
15](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#015) <span id="iv.xxvi-p13.1"></span> ,
LXX.), for, saith Solomon, “Thou, even Thou only, knowest the hearts” (
[1 Kings viii. 39](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#039) <span
id="iv.xxvi-p13.2"></span> ); He therefore needed not witnesses to learn
the thoughts of His own creatures, and so He felt no confidence in them
because of their mere, temporary belief. Men, who know neither the
present nor the future, often tell and entrust all without any reserve
to persons who approach them deceitfully and who shortly will fall off
from them; but Christ did not so, for well He knew all their secret
thoughts.

<span id="iv.xxvi-p14"></span> And many such now there are, who have
indeed the name of faith, but are unstable,  <span
id="fr_614"></span>[615](#fn_614) and easily led away; wherefore neither
now doth Christ commit Himself to them, but concealeth from them many
things; and just as we do not place confidence in mere acquaintances but
in real friends, so also doth Christ. Hear what He <span id="page_83">p.
83</span> <span id="iv.xxvi-Page_83"></span> saith to His disciples,
“Henceforth I call you not servants, ye are My friends.” ( [John
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#014),
[15](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#015)<span id="iv.xxvi-p15.2"></span> .)
Whence is this and why? “Because all things that I have heard of My
Father I have made known unto you.” And therefore He gave no signs to
the Jews who asked for them, because they asked tempting Him. Indeed the
asking for signs is a practice of tempters both then and now; for even
now there are some that seek them and say, “Why do not miracles take
place also at this present time?” If thou art faithful, as thou oughtest
to be, and lovest Christ as thou oughtest to love Him, thou hast no need
of signs, they are given to the unbelievers. “How then,” asks one, “were
they not given to the Jews?” Given they certainly were; and if there
were times when though they asked they did not receive them, it was
because they asked them not that they might be delivered from their
unbelief, but in order the more to confirm their wickedness.

<span id="iv.xxvi-p16"></span> [John
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#001),
[2](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#002)<span id="iv.xxvi-p16.1"></span> .
“And there was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus. The same came to
Jesus by night.”

<span id="iv.xxvi-p17"></span> This man appears also in the middle of
the Gospel, making defense for Christ; for he saith, “Our law judgeth no
man  <span id="fr_615"></span>[616](#fn_615) before it hear him” ( [John
7.51](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#051)<span id="iv.xxvi-p18.2"></span>
); and the Jews in anger replied to him, “Search and look, for out of
Galilee ariseth no prophet.” Again after the crucifixion he bestowed
great care upon the burial of the Lord’s body: “There came also,” saith
the Evangelist, “Nicodemus, which came to the Lord  <span
id="fr_616"></span>[617](#fn_616) by night, and brought a mixture of
myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight.” ( [John
19.39](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#039)<span id="iv.xxvi-p19.3"></span>
.) And even now he was disposed towards Christ,  <span
id="fr_617"></span>[618](#fn_617) but not as he ought, nor with proper
sentiments respecting Him, for he was as yet entangled in Jewish
infirmity. Wherefore he came by night, because he feared to do so by
day. Yet not for this did the merciful God reject or rebuke him, or
deprive him of His instruction, but even with much kindness conversed
with him and disclosed to him very exalted doctrines, enigmatically
indeed, but nevertheless He disclosed them. For far more deserving of
pardon was he than those who acted thus through wickedness. They are
entirely without excuse; but he, though he was liable to condemnation,
yet was not so to an equal degree. “How then does the Evangelist say
nothing of the kind concerning him?” He has said in another place, that
“of the rulers also many believed on Him, but because of the Jews  <span
id="fr_618"></span>[619](#fn_618) they did not confess (Him), lest they
should be put out of the synagogue” ( [John
12.42](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#042)<span id="iv.xxvi-p21.2"></span>
); but here he has implied the whole by mentioning his coming “by
night.” What then saith Nicodemus?

<span id="iv.xxvi-p22"></span>“Rabbi, we know that Thou art a Teacher
come from God: for no man can do the miracles that Thou doest, except
God be with him.”

<span id="iv.xxvi-p23"></span> \[2.\] Nicodemus yet lingers  <span
id="fr_619"></span>[620](#fn_619) below, has yet human thoughts
concerning Him, and speaks of Him as of a Prophet, imagining nothing
great from His miracles. “We know,” he says, “that Thou art a Teacher
come from God.” “Why then comest thou by night and secretly, to Him that
speaketh the things of God, to Him who cometh from God? Why conversest
thou not with Him openly?” But Jesus said nothing like this to him, nor
did He rebuke him; for, saith the Prophet, “A bruised reed shall He not
break, and smoking flax shall he not quench; He shall not strive nor
cry” ( [Isa. 42:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#002),
[3](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#003), [Matt.
12:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#019),
[20](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#020)<span id="iv.xxvi-p24.2"></span> ):
and again He saith Himself, “I came not to condemn the world, but to
save the world.” ( [John 12.47](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#047)<span
id="iv.xxvi-p24.3"></span> .)

<span id="iv.xxvi-p25"></span>“No man can do these miracles, except God
be with him.”

<span id="iv.xxvi-p26"></span> Still here Nicodemus speaks like the
heretics, in saying, that He hath a power working within Him,  <span
id="fr_620"></span>[621](#fn_620) and hath need of the aid of others to
do as He did. What then saith Christ? Observe His exceeding
condescension. He refrained for a while from saying, “I need not the
help of others, but do all things with power, for I am the Very Son of
God, and have the same power as My Father,” because this would have been
too hard for His hearer; for I say now what I am always saying, that
what Christ desired was, not so much for a while to reveal His own
Dignity, as to persuade men that He did nothing contrary to His Father.
And therefore in many places he appears in words confined by limits,
 <span id="fr_621"></span>[622](#fn_621) but in His actions He doth not
so. For when He worketh a miracle, He doth all with power, saying, “I
will, be thou clean.” ( [Matt. viii. 3](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#003)
<span id="iv.xxvi-p28.2"></span> .) “Talitha, arise.” ( [Mark v.
41](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#041) <span id="iv.xxvi-p28.3"></span> ;
not verbally quoted.) “Stretch forth thy hand.” ( [Mark iii.
5](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#005) <span id="iv.xxvi-p28.4"></span> .)
“Thy sins be forgiven thee.” ( [Matt. ix.
2](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#002) <span id="iv.xxvi-p28.5"></span> .)
“Peace, be still.” ( [Mark iv. 39](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#039)
<span id="iv.xxvi-p28.6"></span> .)  “Take up thy bed, and go unto thine
house.” ( [Matt. ix. 6](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#006) <span
id="iv.xxvi-p28.7"></span> .) “Thou foul spirit, I say unto thee, come
out of him.” ( [Mark ix. 25](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#025) <span
id="iv.xxvi-p28.8"></span> ; not verbally quoted.) “Be it unto thee even
as thou wilt.” ( [Matt. xv. 28](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#028) <span
id="iv.xxvi-p28.9"></span> .) “If any one say (aught) unto you, ye shall
say, The Lord hath need of him.” ( [Mark xi.
3](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#003) <span id="iv.xxvi-p28.10"></span> .)
“This day shalt thou be with Me in Paradise.” ( [Luke xxiii.
43](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#043) <span id="iv.xxvi-p28.11"></span>
.) “Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not
kill; but I say unto you, that whosoever is angry with his brother
without a cause, shall be in danger of the judgment.” ( [Matt.
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#021),
[22](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#022)<span id="iv.xxvi-p28.12"></span>
.) “Come ye after Me, and I will make you fishers of men.” ( [Mark i.
17](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#017) <span id="iv.xxvi-p28.13"></span>
.) And everywhere we observe that His authority is great; for in His
actions no one <span id="page_84">p. 84</span> <span
id="iv.xxvi-Page_84"></span> could find fault with what was done. How
was it possible? Had His words not come to pass, nor been accomplished
as He commanded, any one might have said that they were the commands of
a madman; but since they did come to pass, the reality of their
accomplishment stopped men’s mouths even against their will. But with
regard to His discourses, they might often in their insolence charge Him
with madness. Wherefore now in the case of Nicodemus, He utters nothing
openly, but by dark sayings leads him up from his low thoughts, teaching
him, that He has sufficient power in Himself to show forth miracles; for
that His Father begat Him Perfect and All-sufficient, and without any
imperfection.

<span id="iv.xxvi-p29"></span>But let us see how He effects this.
Nicodemus saith, “Rabbi, we know that Thou art a Teacher come from God,
for no man can do the miracles that Thou doest, except God be with him.”
He thought he had said something great when he had spoken thus of
Christ. What then saith Christ? To show that he had not yet set foot
even on the threshold of right knowledge, nor stood in the porch, but
was yet wandering somewhere without the palace, both he and whoever else
should say the like, and that he had not so much as glanced towards true
knowledge when he held such an opinion of the Only-Begotten, what saith
He?

<span id="iv.xxvi-p30"></span> [John
3.3](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#003)<span id="iv.xxvi-p30.1"></span> .
“Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot
see the Kingdom of God.”

<span id="iv.xxvi-p31"></span> That is, “Unless thou art born again and
receivest the right doctrines, thou art wandering somewhere without, and
art far from the Kingdom of heaven.” But He does not speak so plainly as
this. In order to make the saying less hard to bear, He does not plainly
direct it at him, but speaks indefinitely, “Except a man be born again”:
all but saying, “both thou and any other, who may have such opinions
concerning Me, art somewhere without the Kingdom.” Had He not spoken
from a desire to establish this, His answer would have been suitable to
what had been said. Now the Jews, if these words had been addressed to
them, would have derided Him and departed; but Nicodemus shows here also
his desire of instruction.  <span id="fr_622"></span>[623](#fn_622) And
this is why in many places Christ speaks obscurely, because He wishes to
rouse His hearers to ask questions, and to render them more attentive.
For that which is said plainly often escapes the hearer, but what is
obscure renders him more active and zealous. Now what He saith, is
something like this: “If thou art not born again, if thou partakest not
of the Spirit which is by the washing  <span
id="fr_623"></span>[624](#fn_623) of Regeneration, thou canst not have a
right opinion of Me, for the opinion which thou hast is not spiritual,
but carnal.”  <span id="fr_624"></span>[625](#fn_624) ( [Tit. iii.
5](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#005) <span id="iv.xxvi-p34.3"></span> .)
But He did not speak thus, as refusing to confound  <span
id="fr_625"></span>[626](#fn_625) one who had brought such as he had,
and who had spoken to the best of his ability; and He leads him
unsuspectedly up to greater knowledge, saying, “Except a man be born
again.” The word “again,”  <span id="fr_626"></span>[627](#fn_626) in
this place, some understand to mean “from heaven,” others, “from the
beginning.” “It is impossible,” saith Christ, “for one not so born to
see the Kingdom of God”; in this pointing to Himself, and declaring that
there is another beside the natural sight, and that we have need of
other eyes to behold Christ. Having heard this,

<span id="iv.xxvi-p37"></span> [John
3.4](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#004)<span id="iv.xxvi-p37.1"></span> .
“Nicodemus saith, How can a man be born when he is old?”

<span id="iv.xxvi-p38"></span> Callest thou Him “Master,” sayest thou
that He is “come from God,” and yet receivest thou not His words, but
usest to thy Teacher a manner of speaking which expresses  <span
id="fr_627"></span>[628](#fn_627) much perplexity? For the “How,” is the
doubting question of those who have no strong belief, but who are yet of
the earth. Therefore Sarah laughed when she had said, “How?” And many
others having asked this question, have fallen from the faith.

<span id="iv.xxvi-p40"></span> \[3.\] And thus heretics continue in
their heresy, because they frequently make this enquiry, saying, some of
them, “How was He begotten?” others, “How was He made flesh?” and
subjecting that Infinite Essence to the weakness of their own
reasonings.  <span id="fr_628"></span>[629](#fn_628) Knowing which, we
ought to avoid this unseasonable curiosity, for they who search into
these matters shall, without learning the “How,” fall away from the
right faith. On this account Nicodemus, being in doubt, enquires the
manner in which this can be, (for he understood that the words spoken
referred to himself,) is confused, and dizzy,  <span
id="fr_629"></span>[630](#fn_629) and in perplexity, having come as to a
man, and hearing more than man’s words, and such as no one ever yet had
heard; and for a while he rouses himself at the sublimity of the
sayings, but yet is in darkness, and unstable, borne about in every
direction, and continually falling away from the faith. And therefore he
perseveres in proving the impossibility, so as to provoke Him to clearer
teaching.

<span id="iv.xxvi-p43"></span>“Can a man,” he saith, “enter into his
mother’s womb, and be born?”

<span id="iv.xxvi-p44"></span>Seest thou how when one commits spiritual
things to his own reasonings, he speaks ridiculously, seems to be
trifling, or to be drunken, when he pries into what has been said beyond
what seems good to God, and admits not the submission <span
id="page_85">p. 85</span> <span id="iv.xxvi-Page_85"></span> of faith?
Nicodemus heard of the spiritual Birth, yet perceived it not as
spiritual, but dragged down the words to the lowness of the flesh, and
made a doctrine so great and high depend upon physical consequence. And
so he invents frivolities, and ridiculous difficulties. Wherefore Paul
said, “The natural  <span id="fr_630"></span>[631](#fn_630) man
receiveth not the things of the Spirit.” ( [1 Cor. ii.
14](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#014) <span id="iv.xxvi-p45.2"></span> .)
Yet even in this he preserved his reverence for Christ, for he did not
mock at what had been said, but, deeming it impossible, held his peace.
There were two difficulties; a Birth of this kind, and the Kingdom; for
neither had the name of the Kingdom ever been heard among the Jews, nor
of a Birth like this. But he stops for a while at the first, which most
astonished  <span id="fr_631"></span>[632](#fn_631) his mind.

<span id="iv.xxvi-p47"></span> Let us then, knowing this, not enquire
into things relating to God by reasoning, nor bring heavenly matters
under the rule of earthly consequences, nor subject them to the
necessity of nature; but let us think of all reverently, believing as
the Scriptures have said; for the busy and curious person gains nothing,
and besides not finding what he seeks, shall suffer extreme punishment.
Thou hast heard, that (the Father) begat (the Son): believe what thou
hast heard; but do ask not, “How,” and so take away the Generation; to
do so would be extreme folly. For if this man, because, on hearing of a
Generation, not that ineffable <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.xxvi-p47.1"></span>Generation</span> , but this which is by
grace, he conceived nothing great concerning it, but human and earthly
thoughts, was therefore darkened and in doubt, what punishment must they
deserve, who are busy and curious about that most awful <span
class="c11"><span id="iv.xxvi-p47.2"></span>Generation</span> , which
transcends all reason and intellect? For nothing causes such dizziness
 <span id="fr_632"></span>[633](#fn_632) as human reasoning, all whose
words are of earth, and which cannot endure to be enlightened from
above. Earthly reasonings are full of mud, and therefore need we streams
from heaven, that when the mud has settled, the clearer portion may rise
and mingle with the heavenly lessons; and this comes to pass, when we
present an honest soul and an upright life. For certainly it is possible
for the intellect to be darkened, not only by unseasonable curiosity,
but also by corrupt manners; wherefore Paul hath said to the
Corinthians, “I have fed you with milk, and not with meat; for hitherto
ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able, for ye are yet
carnal; for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and
divisions, are ye not carnal?” ( [1 Cor. iii.
2](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#002) <span id="iv.xxvi-p48.1"></span> .)
And also in the Epistle to the Hebrews, and in many places, one may see
Paul asserting that this is the cause of evil doctrines; for that the
soul possessed by passions  <span id="fr_633"></span>[634](#fn_633)
cannot behold anything great or noble, but as if darkened by a sort of
film  <span id="fr_634"></span>[635](#fn_634) suffers most grievous
dimsightedness.

<span id="iv.xxvi-p51"></span>Let us then cleanse ourselves, let us
kindle the light of knowledge, let us not sow among thorns. What the
thorns are, ye know, though we tell you not; for often ye have heard
Christ call the cares of this present life, and the deceitfulness of
riches, by this name. ( [Matt. xiii.
22](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#022) <span id="iv.xxvi-p51.1"></span> .)
And with reason. For as thorns are unfruitful, so are these things; as
thorns tear those that handle them, so do these passions; as thorns are
readily caught by the fire, and hateful by the husbandman, so too are
the things of the world; as in thorns, wild beasts, and snakes, and
scorpions hide themselves, so do they in the deceitfulness of riches.
But let us kindle the fire of the Spirit, that we may consume the
thorns, and drive away the beasts, and make the field clear for the
husbandman; and after cleansing it, let us water it with the streams of
the Spirit, let us plant the fruitful olive, that most kindly of trees,
the evergreen, the light-giving, the nutritious, the wholesome. All
these qualities hath almsgiving, which is, as it were, a seal on  <span
id="fr_635"></span>[636](#fn_635) those that possess it. This plant not
even death when it comes causes to wither, but ever it stands
enlightening the mind, feeding the sinews  <span
id="fr_636"></span>[637](#fn_636) of the soul, and rendering its
strength mightier. And if we constantly possess it, we shall be able
with confidence to behold the Bridegroom, and to enter into the bridal
chamber; to which may we all attain, through the grace and
lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, with whom to the Father and the
Holy Ghost be glory, for ever and ever. Amen.
