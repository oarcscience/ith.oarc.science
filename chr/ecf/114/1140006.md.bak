<span id="iv.iii-p7"></span> <span class="c15"><span
id="iv.iii-p7.1"></span>Homily I.</span>

<span id="iv.iii-p8"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.iii-p8.1"></span>Preface.</span>

<span id="iv.iii-p9"></span> \[1.\] <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.iii-p9.1"></span>They</span> that are spectators of the heathen
games, when they have learned that a distinguished athlete and winner of
crowns is come from any quarter, run all together to view his wrestling,
and all his skill and strength; and you may see the whole theater of
many ten thousands, all there straining their eyes both of body and
mind, that nothing of what is done may escape them. So again these same
persons, if any admirable musician come amongst them, leave all that
they had in hand, which often is necessary and pressing business, and
mount the steps, and sit listening very attentively to the words and the
accompaniments, and criticising the agreement of the two. This is what
the many do.

<span id="iv.iii-p10"></span>Again; those who are skilled in rhetoric do
just the same with respect to the sophists, for they too have their
theaters, and their audience, and clappings of hands, and noise, and
closest criticism of what is said.

<span id="iv.iii-p11"></span>And if in the case of rhetoricians,
musicians, and athletes, people sit in the one case to look on, in the
other to see at once and to listen with such earnest attention; what
zeal, what earnestness ought ye in reason to display, when it is no
musician or debater who now comes forward to a trial of skill, but when
a man is speaking from heaven, and utters a voice plainer than thunder?
for he has pervaded the whole earth with the sound; and occupied and
filled it, not by the loudness of the cry, but by moving his tongue with
the grace of God.

<span id="iv.iii-p12"></span>And what is wonderful, this sound, great as
it is, is neither a harsh nor an unpleasant one, but sweeter and more
delightful than all harmony of music, and with more skill to soothe; and
besides all this, most holy, and most awful, and full of mysteries so
great, and bringing with it goods so great, that if men were exactly and
with ready mind to receive and keep them, they could no longer be mere
men nor remain upon the earth, but would take their stand above all the
things of this life, and having adapted themselves to the condition of
angels, would dwell on earth just as if it were heaven.

<span id="iv.iii-p13"></span> \[2.\] For the son of thunder, the beloved
of Christ, the pillar of the Churches throughout the world, who holds
the keys of heaven, who drank the cup of Christ, and was baptized with
His baptism, who lay upon his Master’s bosom with much confidence,
 <span id="fr_2"></span>[3](#fn_2.md) this man comes forward to us now; not
as an actor of a play, not hiding his head with a mask, (for he hath
another sort of words to speak,) nor mounting a platform,  <span
id="fr_3"></span>[4](#fn_3.md) nor striking the stage with his foot, nor
dressed out with apparel of gold, but he enters wearing a robe of
inconceivable beauty. For he will appear before us having “put on
Christ” ( [Rom. 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#014.md), [Gal.
3:27](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#027)<span id="iv.iii-p15.3"></span> .md),
having his beautiful “feet shod with the preparation of the Gospel of
peace” ( [Eph. vi. 15](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#015.md) <span
id="iv.iii-p15.4"></span> ); wearing a girdle not about his waist, but
about his loins, not made of scarlet leather nor daubed outside  <span
id="fr_4"></span>[5](#fn_4.md) with gold, but woven and composed of truth
itself. Now will he appear before us, not acting a part, (for with him
there is nothing counterfeit, nor fiction, nor fable,) but with unmasked
head he <span id="page_2">p. 2</span> <span id="iv.iii-Page_2"></span>
proclaims to us the truth unmasked; not making the audience believe him
other than he is by carriage, by look, by voice, needing for the
delivery of his message no instruments of music, as harp, lyre, or any
other the like, for he effects all with his tongue, uttering a voice
which is sweeter and more profitable than that of any harper or any
music. All heaven is his stage; his theater, the habitable world; his
audience, all angels; and of men as many as are angels already, or
desire to become so, for none but these can hear that harmony aright,
and show it forth by their works; all the rest, like little children who
hear, but what they hear understand not, from their anxiety about
sweetmeats and childish playthings; so they too, being in mirth and
luxury, and living only for wealth and power and sensuality, hear
sometimes what is said, it is true, but show forth nothing great or
noble in their actions through fastening  <span
id="fr_5"></span>[6](#fn_5.md) themselves for good to the clay of the
brickmaking. By this Apostle stand the powers from above, marveling at
the beauty of his soul, and his understanding, and the bloom of that
virtue by which he drew unto him Christ Himself, and obtained the grace
of the Spirit. For he hath made ready his soul, as some well-fashioned
and jeweled lyre with strings of gold, and yielded it for the utterance
of something great and sublime to the Spirit.

<span id="iv.iii-p18"></span>\[3.\] Seeing then it is no longer the
fisherman the son of Zebedee, but He who knoweth “the deep things of
God” ( [1 Cor. ii. 10](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#010.md) <span
id="iv.iii-p18.1"></span> ), the Holy Spirit I mean, that striketh this
lyre, let us hearken accordingly. For he will say nothing to us as a
man, but what he saith, he will say from the depths of the Spirit, from
those secret things which before they came to pass the very Angels knew
not; since they too have learned by the voice of John with us, and by
us, the things which we know. And this hath another Apostle declared,
saying, “To the intent that unto the principalities and powers might be
known by the Church the manifold wisdom of God.” ( [Eph. iii.
10](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#010) <span id="iv.iii-p18.2"></span> ..md)
If then principalities, and powers, and Cherubim, and Seraphim, learned
these things by the Church, it is very clear that they were exceedingly
earnest in listening to this teaching; and even in this we have been not
a little honored, that the Angels learned things which before they knew
not with us; I do not at present speak of their learning by us also. Let
us then show much silence and orderly behavior; not to-day only, nor
during the day on which we are hearers, but during all our life, since
it is at all times good to hear Him. For if we long to know what is
going on in the palace, what, for instance, the king has said, what he
has done, what counsel he is taking concerning his subjects, though in
truth these things are for the most part nothing to us; much more is it
desirable to hear what God hath said, especially when all concerns us.
And all this will this man tell us exactly, as being a friend of the
King Himself, or rather, as having Him speaking within himself, and from
Him hearing all things which He heareth from the Father. “I have called
you friends,” He saith, “for all things that I have heard of My Father,
I have made known unto you.” ( [John xv.
15](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#015) <span id="iv.iii-p18.3"></span> ..md)

<span id="iv.iii-p19"></span> \[4.\] As then we should all run together
if we saw one from above bend down “on a sudden”  <span
id="fr_6"></span>[7](#fn_6.md) from the height of heaven, promising to
describe exactly all things there, even so let us be disposed now. It is
from thence that this Man speaketh to us; He is not of this world, as
Christ Himself declareth, “Ye are not of the world” ( [John xv.
19](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#019) <span id="iv.iii-p20.3"></span> .md),
and He hath speaking within him the Comforter, the Omnipresent, who
knoweth the things of God as exactly as the soul of man knoweth what
belongs to herself, the Spirit of holiness, the righteous Spirit, the
guiding Spirit, which leads men by the hand to heaven, which gives them
other eyes, fitting them to see things to come as though present, and
giving them even in the flesh to look into things heavenly. To Him then
let us yield ourselves during all our life  <span
id="fr_7"></span>[8](#fn_7.md) in much tranquillity. Let none dull, none
sleepy, none sordid, enter here and tarry; but let us remove ourselves
to heaven, for there He speaketh these things to those who are citizens
there. And if we tarry on earth, we shall gain nothing great from
thence. For the words of John are nothing to those who do not desire to
be freed from this swinish life, just as the things of this world to him
are nothing. The thunder amazes our souls, having sound without
significance;  <span id="fr_8"></span>[9](#fn_8.md) but this man’s voice
troubles none of the faithful, yea, rather releases them from trouble
and confusion; it amazes the devils only, and those who are their
slaves. Therefore that we may know how it amazes them, let us preserve
deep silence, both external and mental, but especially the latter; for
what advantage is it that the mouth be hushed, if the soul is disturbed
and full of tossing? I look for that calm which is of the mind, of the
soul, since it is the hearing of the soul which I require. Let then no
desire of riches trouble us, no lust of glory, no tyranny of anger, nor
the crowd of other passions besides these; for it is not possible for
the ear, except it be cleansed, to perceive as it ought the sublimity of
the things spoken; nor rightly to understand the awful and unutterable
nature of these mysteries, and all other virtue which is in <span
id="page_3">p. 3</span> <span id="iv.iii-Page_3"></span> these divine
oracles. If a man cannot learn well a melody on pipe or harp, unless he
in every way strain his attention; how shall one, who sits as a listener
to sounds mystical, be able to hear with a careless soul?

<span id="iv.iii-p23"></span>\[5.\] Wherefore Christ Himself exhorted,
saying, “Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your
pearls before swine.” ( [Matt. vii. 6](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#006.md)
<span id="iv.iii-p23.1"></span> .) He called these words “pearls,”
though in truth they be much more precious than they, because we have no
substance more precious than that. For this reason too He is wont often
to compare their sweetness to honey, not that so much only is the
measure of their sweetness, but because amongst us there is nothing
sweeter. Now, to show that they very exceedingly surpass the nature of
precious stones, and the sweetness of any honey, hear the prophet
speaking concerning them, and declaring this superiority; “More to be
desired are they,” he saith “than gold and much precious stone; sweeter
are they also than honey and the honeycomb.” ( [Ps. xix.
10](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#010) <span id="iv.iii-p23.2"></span> ..md)
But to those (only) who are in health; wherefore he has added, “For thy
servant keepeth them.” And again in another place calling them sweet he
has added, “to my throat.” For he saith, “How sweet are thy words unto
my throat.” ( [Ps. cxix. 103](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#103.md) <span
id="iv.iii-p23.3"></span> .) And again he insisteth on the superiority,
saying, “Above honey and the honeycomb to my mouth.” For he was in very
sound health. And let not us either come nigh to these while we are
sick, but when we have healed our soul, so receive the food that is
offered us.

<span id="iv.iii-p24"></span> It is for this reason that, after so long
a preface, I have not yet attempted to fathom  <span
id="fr_9"></span>[10](#fn_9) these expressions (of St. John.md), in order
that every one having laid aside all manner of infirmity, as though he
were entering into heaven itself, so may enter here pure, and freed from
wrath and carefulness and anxiety of this life, of all other passions.
For it is not otherwise possible for a man to gain from hence anything
great, except he have first so cleansed anew his soul. And let no one
say that the time to the coming communion  <span
id="fr_10"></span>[11](#fn_10.md) is short, for it is possible, not only in
five days, but in one moment, to change the whole course of life. Tell
me what is worse than a robber and a murderer, is not this the extremest
kind of wickedness? Yet such an one arrived straight at the summit of
excellence, and passed into Paradise itself, not needing days, nor half
a day, but one little moment. So that a man may change suddenly, and
become gold instead of clay. For since what belongs to virtue and to
vice is not by nature, the change is easy, as being independent of any
necessity. “If ye be willing and obedient,” He saith, “ye shall eat the
good of the land.” ( [Isa. i. 19](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#019.md) <span
id="iv.iii-p26.2"></span> .) Seest thou that there needs the will only?
will—not the common wishing of the multitude—but earnest will. For I
know that all are wishing to fly up to heaven even now; but it is
necessary to show forth the wish by works. The merchant too wishes to
get rich; but he doth not allow his wish to stop with the thought of it;
no, he fits out a ship, and gets together sailors, and engages a pilot,
and furnishes the vessel with all other stores, and borrows money, and
crosses the sea, and goes away into a strange land, and endures many
dangers, and all the rest which they know who sail the sea. So too must
we show our will; for we also sail a voyage, not from land to land, but
from earth to heaven. Let us then so order our reason, that it be
serviceable to steer our upward course, and our sailors that they be
obedient to it, and let our vessel be stout, that it be not swamped
amidst the reverses and despondencies of this life, nor be lifted up by
the blasts of vainglory, but be a fast and easy vessel. If so we order
our ship, and so our pilot and our crew, we shall sail with a fair wind,
and we shall draw down to ourselves the Son of God, the true Pilot, who
will not leave our bark to be engulfed, but, though ten thousand winds
may blow, will rebuke the winds and the sea, and instead of raging
waves, make a great calm.

<span id="iv.iii-p27"></span>\[6.\] Having therefore ordered yourselves,
so come to our next assembly, if at least it be at all an object of
desire to you to hear somewhat to your advantage, and lay up what is
said in your souls. But let not one of you be the “wayside,” none the
“stony ground,” none the “full of thorns.” ( [Matt.
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#004.md),
[5](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#005.md),
[7](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#007)<span id="iv.iii-p27.1"></span> ..md)
Let us make ourselves fallow lands. For so shall we (the preachers) put
in the seed with gladness, when we see the land clean, but if stony or
rough, pardon us if we like not to labor in vain. For if we shall leave
off sowing and begin to cut up thorns, surely to cast seed into ground
unwrought were extreme folly.

<span id="iv.iii-p28"></span>It is not meet that he who has the
advantage of such hearing be partaker of the table of devils. “For what
fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness?” ( [2 Cor. vi.
14](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#014) <span id="iv.iii-p28.1"></span> ..md)
Thou standest listening to John, and learning the things of the Spirit
by him; and dost thou after this depart to listen to harlots speaking
vile things, and acting viler, and to effeminates cuffing one another?
How wilt thou be able to be fairly cleansed, if thou wallowest in such
mire? Why need I reckon in detail all the indecency that is there? All
there is laughter, all is shame, all disgrace, revilings and mockings,
all abandonment, all destruction. See, I forewarn and charge you all.
Let none of those who enjoy the blessings of this table destroy his own
<span id="page_4">p. 4</span> <span id="iv.iii-Page_4"></span> soul by
those pernicious spectacles. All that is said and done there is a
pageant of Satan. But ye who have been initiated know what manner of
covenants ye made with us, or rather ye made with Christ when He guided
you into His mysteries, what ye spoke to Him, what speech ye had with
Him concerning Satan’s pageant;  <span id="fr_11"></span>[12](#fn_11.md)
how with Satan and his angels ye renounced this also, and promised that
you would not so much as cast a glance  <span
id="fr_12"></span>[13](#fn_12.md) that way. There is then no slight ground
for fear, lest, by becoming careless of such promises, one should render
himself unworthy of these mysteries.

<span id="iv.iii-p31"></span> \[7.\] Seest thou not how in king’s
palaces it is not those who have offended, but those who have been
honorably distinguished,  <span id="fr_13"></span>[14](#fn_13.md) that are
called to share especial favor,  <span id="fr_14"></span>[15](#fn_14.md)
and are numbered among the king’s friends. A messenger has come to us
from heaven, sent by God Himself, to speak with us on certain necessary
matters, and you leave hearing His will, and the message He sends to
you, and sit listening to stage-players. What thunderings, what bolts
from heaven, does not this conduct deserve! For as it is not meet to
partake of the table of devils, so neither is it of the listening to
devils; nor to be present with filthy raiment at that glorious Table,
loaded with so many good things, which God Himself hath provided. Such
is its power, that it can raise us at once to heaven, if only we
approach it with a sober mind. For it is not possible that he who is
continually under the influence of  <span id="fr_15"></span>[16](#fn_15.md)
the words of God, can remain in this present low condition, but he needs
must presently take wing, and fly away to the land which is above, and
light on the infinite treasures of good things; which may it be that we
all attain to, through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus
Christ, through whom and with whom be glory to the Father and the
All-holy Spirit, now and ever, and world without end. Amen.
