<span id="v.v-p1"></span> <span class="c15"><span
id="v.v-p1.1"></span>Homily I.</span>

<span id="v.v-p2"></span> <span id="v.v-p2.1"></span> <span
class="c1"><span id="v.v-p2.2"></span>[Heb.
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#001.md),

<span id="v.v-p3"></span> *“God who at sundry times and in divers
manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the Prophets, hath at the
end of the days*  <span id="fr_2719"></span>[2720](#fn_2719.md) *spoken
unto us by His Son whom He hath appointed heir of all things, by whom
also He made the worlds.”*

<span id="v.v-p5"></span> \[1.\] <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v-p5.1"></span>Truly</span> , “where sin abounded, grace did much
more abound.” ( [Rom. v. 20](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#020.md) <span
id="v.v-p5.2"></span> .) This at least the blessed Paul intimates here
also, in the very beginning of his Epistle to the Hebrews. For since as
it was likely that afflicted, worn out by evils, and judging of things
thereby, they would think themselves worse off than all other men,—he
shows that herein they had rather been made partakers of greater, even
very exceeding, grace; arousing the hearer at the very opening of his
discourse. Wherefore he says, “God who at sundry times and in divers
manners spake in times past unto the fathers by the Prophets, hath at
the end of the days spoken unto us by His Son.”

<span id="v.v-p6"></span>Why did he \[Paul\] not oppose “himself” to
“the prophets”? Certainly, he was much greater than they, inasmuch as a
greater trust was committed to him. Yet he doth not so. Why? First, to
avoid speaking great things concerning himself. Secondly, because his
hearers were not yet perfect. And thirdly, because he rather wished to
exalt them, and to show that their superiority was great. As if he had
said, What so great matter is it that He sent prophets to our fathers?
For to us \[He has sent\] His own only-begotten Son Himself.

<span id="v.v-p7"></span>And well did he begin thus, “At sundry times
and in divers manners,” for he points out that not even the prophets
themselves saw God; nevertheless, the Son saw Him. For the expressions,
“at sundry times and in divers manners” are the same as “in different
ways.” “For I” (saith He) “have multiplied visions, and used similitudes
by the ministry of the Prophets.” ( [Hos. xii.
10](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#010) <span id="v.v-p7.1"></span> ..md)
Wherefore the excellency consists not in this alone, that to them indeed
prophets were sent, but to us the Son; but that none of them saw God,
but the Only-begotten Son saw Him. He doth not indeed at once assert
this, but by what he says afterwards he establishes it, when he speaks
concerning His human nature; “For to which of the Angels said He, Thou
art My Son,” ( [Heb. 1.5](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#005.md)<span
id="v.v-p7.2"></span> ), and, “Sit thou on My right hand”? ( [Heb.
1.13](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#013)<span id="v.v-p7.3"></span> ..md)

<span id="v.v-p8"></span>And look on his great wisdom. First he shows
the superiority from the prophets. Then having established this as
acknowledged, he declares that to them indeed He spake by the prophets,
but to us by the Only-begotten. Then \[He spake\] to them by Angels, and
this again he establishes, with good reason (for angels also held
converse with the Jews): yet even herein we have the superiority,
inasmuch as the Master \[spake\] to us, but to them servants, and
prophets, fellow-servants.

<span id="v.v-p9"></span>\[2.\] Well also said he, “at the end of the
days,” for by this he both stirs them up and encourages them desponding
of the future. For as he says also in another place, “The Lord is at
hand, be careful for nothing” ( [Phil.
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#005.md),
[6](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#006)<span id="v.v-p9.1"></span> .md), and
again, “For now is our salvation nearer than when we believed” ( [Rom.
xiii. 11](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#011.md) <span id="v.v-p9.2"></span>
): so also here. What then is it which he says? That whoever is spent in
the conflict, when he hears of the end thereof, recovers his breath a
little, knowing that it is the end indeed of his labors, but the
beginning of his rest.

<span id="v.v-p10"></span> “Hath in the end of the days spoken unto us
in \[His\] Son.” Behold again he uses the saying, “in \[His\] Son,”
 <span id="fr_2720"></span>[2721](#fn_2720.md) for “through the Son,”
 <span id="fr_2721"></span>[2722](#fn_2721.md) against those who assert
that this phrase is proper to the Spirit.  <span
id="fr_2722"></span>[2723](#fn_2722.md) Dost thou see that the \[word\]
“in” is “through”?  <span id="fr_2723"></span>[2724](#fn_2723.md)

<span id="v.v-p15"></span>And the expression, “In times past,” and this,
“In the end of the days,” shadows forth some other meaning:—that when a
long time had intervened, when we were on the edge of punishment, when
the Gifts had failed, when there was no expectation of deliverance, when
we were expecting to have less than all—then we have had more.

<span id="v.v-p16"></span>And see how considerately he hath spoken it.
For he said not, “Christ spake” (albeit it was He who did speak), but
inasmuch as their souls were weak, and they were not yet able to hear
the things concerning Christ, he says, “God hath spoken by Him.” What
meanest thou? <span id="page_367">p. 367</span> <span
id="v.v-Page_367"></span> did God speak through the Son? Yes. What then?
Is it thus thou showest the superiority? for here thou hast but pointed
out that both the New and the Old \[Covenants\] are of One and the same:
and that this superiority is not great. Wherefore he henceforth follows
on upon this argument, saying, “He spake unto us by \[His\] Son.”

<span id="v.v-p17"></span>(Note, how Paul makes common cause, and puts
himself on a level with the disciples, saying, He spake “to us”: and yet
He did not speak to him, but to the Apostles, and through them to the
many. But he lifts them \[the Hebrews\] up, and declares that He spake
also to them. And as yet he doth not at all reflect on the Jews. For
almost all to whom the prophets spake, were a kind of evil and polluted
persons. But as yet the discourse is not of these: but, hitherto of the
gifts derived from God.)

<span id="v.v-p18"></span>“Whom He appointed,” saith he, “heir of all.”
What is “whom He appointed heir of all”? He speaks here of the flesh
\[the human nature\]. As He also says in the second Psalm, “Ask of Me,
and I will give Thee the heathen for Thine inheritance.” ( [Ps. ii.
8](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#008) <span id="v.v-p18.1"></span> ..md) For
no longer is “Jacob the portion of the Lord” nor “Israel His
inheritance” ( [Deut. xxxii. 9](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#009.md) <span
id="v.v-p18.2"></span> ), but all men: that is to say, He hath made Him
Lord of all: which Peter also said in the Acts, “God hath made Him both
Lord and Christ.” ( [Acts ii. 36](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#036.md) <span
id="v.v-p18.3"></span> .) But he has used the name “Heir,” declaring two
things: His proper sonship  <span id="fr_2724"></span>[2725](#fn_2724.md)
and His indefeasible sovereignty. “Heir of all,” that is, of all the
world.

<span id="v.v-p20"></span> \[3.\] Then again he brings back his
discourse to its former point. “By whom also He made the worlds \[the
ages\].”  <span id="fr_2725"></span>[2726](#fn_2725.md) Where are those who
say, There was \[a time\] when He was not?

<span id="v.v-p22"></span>Then, using degrees of ascent, he uttered that
which is far greater than all this, saying,

<span id="v.v-p23"></span> [Heb. 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003.md),
[4](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#004.md)<span id="v.v-p23.1"></span> . “Who,
(being the brightness of His glory, and the express image of His person,
and upholding all things by the word of His power,) when He had by
Himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on
high; being made  <span id="fr_2726"></span>[2727](#fn_2726.md) so much
better than the Angels as He hath by inheritance obtained a more
excellent name than they.”

<span id="v.v-p25"></span>O! the wisdom of the Apostle! or rather, not
the wisdom of Paul, but the grace of the Spirit is the thing to wonder
at. For surely he uttered not these things of his own mind, nor in that
way did he find his wisdom. (For whence could it be? From the knife, and
the skins, or the workshop?) But it was from the working of God. For his
own understanding did not give birth to these thoughts, which was then
so mean and slender as in nowise to surpass the baser sort; (for how
could it, seeing it spent itself wholly on bargains and skins?) but the
grace of the Spirit shows forth its strength by whomsoever it will.

<span id="v.v-p26"></span>For just as one, wishing to lead up a little
child to some lofty place, reaching up even to the top of Heaven, does
this gently and by degrees, leading him upwards by the steps from
below,—then when he has set him on high, and bidden him to gaze
downwards, and sees him turning giddy and confused, and dizzy, taking
hold of him, he leads him down to the lower stand, allowing him to take
breath; then when he hath recovered it, leads him up again, and again
brings him down;—just so did the blessed Paul likewise, both with the
Hebrews and everywhere, having learnt it from his Master. For even He
also did so; sometimes He led His hearers up on high, and sometimes He
brought them down, not allowing them to remain very long.

<span id="v.v-p27"></span> See him, then, even here—by how many steps he
led them up, and placed them near the very summit of religion, and then
or ever they grow giddy, and are seized with dizziness, how he leads
them again lower down, and allowing them to take breath, says, “He spake
unto us by \[His\] Son,” “whom He appointed Heir of all things.”  <span
id="fr_2727"></span>[2728](#fn_2727.md) For the name of Son is so far
common. For where a true  <span id="fr_2728"></span>[2729](#fn_2728.md)
\[Son\] it is understood of, He is above all: but however that may be,
for the present he proves that He is from above.

<span id="v.v-p30"></span>And see how he says it: “Whom He appointed,”
saith he, “heir of all things.” The phrase, “He appointed Heir,” is
humble. Then he placed them on the higher step, adding, “by whom also He
made the worlds.” Then on a higher still, and after which there is no
other, “who being the brightness of His glory, and the express image of
His person.” Truly he has led them to unapproachable light, to the very
brightness itself. And before they are blinded see how he gently leads
them down again, saying, “and upholding all things by the word of His
power, when He had by Himself purged our sins, sat down on the right
hand of the Majesty.” He does not simply say, “He sat down,” but “after
the purifying, He sat down,” for he hath touched on the Incarnation, and
his utterance is again lowly.

<span id="v.v-p31"></span>Then again having said a little by the way
(for he says, “on the right hand of the Majesty on high”), \[he turns\]
again to what is lowly; “being made so much better than the angels,
<span id="page_368">p. 368</span> <span id="v.v-Page_368"></span> as He
hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.”
Henceforward then he treats here of that which is according to the
flesh, since the phrase “being made better” doth not express His essence
according to the Spirit,  <span id="fr_2729"></span>[2730](#fn_2729.md)
(for that was not “made” but “begotten,”) but according to the flesh:
for this was “made.” Nevertheless the discourse here is not about being
called into  <span id="fr_2730"></span>[2731](#fn_2730.md) existence. But
just as John says, “He that cometh after me, is preferred before me” (
[John 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#015.md),
[30](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#030)<span id="v.v-p33.5"></span> .md),
that is, higher in honor and esteem; so also here, “being made so much
better than the angels”—that is, higher in esteem and better and more
glorious, “by how much He hath obtained by inheritance a more excellent
name than they.” Seest thou that he is speaking of that which is
according to the flesh? For this Name,  <span
id="fr_2731"></span>[2732](#fn_2731.md) God the Word ever had; He did not
afterwards “obtain it by inheritance”; nor did He afterwards become
“better than the Angels, when He had purged our sins”; but He was always
“better,” and better without all comparison.  <span
id="fr_2732"></span>[2733](#fn_2732.md) For this is spoken of Him according
to the flesh.

<span id="v.v-p36"></span>So truly it is our way also, when we talk of
man, to speak things both high and low. Thus, when we say, “Man is
nothing,” “Man is earth,” “Man is ashes,” we call the whole by the worse
part. But when we say, “Man is an immortal animal,” and “Man is
rational, and of kin to those on high,” we call again the whole by the
better part. So also, in the case of Christ, sometimes Paul discourseth
from the less and sometimes from the better; wishing both to establish
the economy, and also to teach about the incorruptible nature.

<span id="v.v-p37"></span>\[4.\] Since then “He hath purged our sins,”
let us continue pure; and let us receive no stain, but preserve the
beauty which He hath implanted in us, and His comeliness undefiled and
pure, “not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing.” ( [Eph. v.
27](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#027) <span id="v.v-p37.1"></span> ..md)
Even little sins are “a spot and a wrinkle,” such a thing, I mean, as
Reproach, Insult, Falsehood.

<span id="v.v-p38"></span>Nay, rather not even are these small, but on
the contrary very great: yea so great as to deprive a man even of the
kingdom of Heaven. How, and in what manner? “He that calleth his brother
fool, is in danger” (He saith) “of hellfire.” ( [Matt. v.
22](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#022) <span id="v.v-p38.1"></span> ..md) But
if it be so with him who calls a man “fool,” which seems to be the
slightest of all things, and rather mere children’s talk; what sentence
of punishment will not he incur, who calleth him malignant and crafty
and envious, and casteth at him ten thousand other reproaches? What more
fearful than this?

<span id="v.v-p39"></span> Now suffer, I beseech you, the word \[of
exhortation\].  <span id="fr_2733"></span>[2734](#fn_2733.md) For if he
that “doeth” \[aught\] to “one of the least, doeth it to Him” ( [Matt.
xxv. 40](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#040.md) <span id="v.v-p40.6"></span>
), and he that “doeth it not to one of the least doeth it not to Him” (
[Matt. xxv. 45](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#045.md) <span
id="v.v-p40.7"></span> ), how is it not the same also in the matter of
good or evil speaking? He that reviles his brother, reviles God: and he
that honors his brother, honors God. Let us train therefore our tongue
to speak good words. For “refrain,” it is said, “thy tongue from evil.”
( [Ps. xxxiv. 13](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#013.md) <span
id="v.v-p40.8"></span> .) For God gave it not that we should speak evil,
that we should revile, that we should calumniate one another; but to
sing hymns to God withal, to speak those things which “give grace to the
hearers” ( [Eph. iv. 29](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#029.md) <span
id="v.v-p40.9"></span> ), things for edification, things for profit.

<span id="v.v-p41"></span>Hast thou spoken evil of a man? What is thy
gain, entangling thyself in mischief together with him? For thou hast
obtained the reputation of a slanderer. For there is not any, no not any
evil, which stops at him that suffers it, but it includes the doer also.
As for instance, the envious person seems indeed to plot against
another, but himself first reaps the fruit of his sin, wasting and
wearing himself away, and being hated of all men. The cheat deprives
another of his money; yea and himself too of men’s good will: and causes
himself to be evil spoken of by all men. Now reputation is much better
than money, for the one it is not easy to wash out, whereas it is easy
to gain possession of the other. Or rather, the absence of the one doth
no hurt to him that wanteth it; but the absence of the other makes you
reproached and ridiculed, and an object of enmity and warfare to all.

<span id="v.v-p42"></span>The passionate man again first punishes and
tears himself in pieces, and then him with whom he is angry.

<span id="v.v-p43"></span>Just so the evil speaker disgraces first
himself and then him who is evil-spoken of: or, it may be, even this
hath proved beyond his power, and while he departs with the credit of a
foul and detestable kind of person, he causes the other to be loved the
more. For when a man hearing a bad name given him, doth not requite the
giver in the same kind, but praises and admires, he doth not praise the
other, but himself. For I before observed that, as calumnies against our
neighbors first touch those who de <span id="page_369">p. 369</span>
<span id="v.v-Page_369"></span> vise the mischief, so also good works
done towards our neighbors, gladden first those who do them. The parent
either of good, or evil, justly reaps the fruit of it first himself. And
just as water, whether it be brackish or sweet, fills the vessels of
those who resort to it, but lessens not the fountain which sends it
forth; so surely also, both wickedness and virtue, from whatever person
they proceed, prove either his joy or his ruin.

<span id="v.v-p44"></span>So far as to the things of this world; but
what speech may recount the things of that world, either the goods or
the evils? There is none. For as to the blessings, they surpass all
thought, not speech only; for their opposites are expressed indeed in
terms familiar to us. For fire, it is said, is there, and darkness, and
bonds, and a worm that never dieth. But this represents not only the
things which are spoken of, but others more intolerable. And to convince
thee, consider at once this first: if it be fire, how is it also
darkness? Seest thou how that fire is more intolerable than this? For it
hath no light. If it be fire, how is it forever burning? Seest thou how
something more intolerable than this happens? For it is not quenched.
Yea, therefore it is called unquenchable. Let us then consider how great
a misery it must be, to be forever burning, and to be in darkness, and
to utter unnumbered groanings, and to gnash the teeth, and not even to
be heard. For if here any one of those ingeniously brought up, should he
be cast into prison, speaks of the mere ill savor, and the being laid in
darkness, and the being bound with murderers, as more intolerable than
any death: think what it is when we are burning with the murderers of
the whole world, neither seeing nor being seen, but in so vast a
multitude thinking that we are alone. For the darkness and gloom doth
not allow our distinguishing those who are near to us, but each will
burn as if he were thus suffering alone. Moreover, if darkness of itself
afflicteth and terrifieth our souls, how then will it be when together
with the darkness there are likewise so great pains and burnings?

<span id="v.v-p45"></span>Wherefore I entreat you to be ever revolving
these things with yourselves, and to submit to the pain of the words,
that we may not undergo the punishment of the things. For assuredly, all
these things shall be, and those whose doings have deserved those
chambers of torture no man shall rescue, not father, nor mother, nor
brother. “For a brother redeemeth not,” He saith; “shall a man redeem?”
( [Ps. xlix. 7](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#007.md) <span
id="v.v-p45.1"></span> , LXX.), though he have much confidence, though
he have great power with God. For it is He Himself who rewards every one
according to his works, and upon these depends our salvation or
punishment.

<span id="v.v-p46"></span>Let us make then to ourselves “friends of the
mammon of unrighteousness” ( [Luke xvi.
9](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#009) <span id="v.v-p46.1"></span> .md), that
is: Let us give alms; let us exhaust our possessions upon them, that so
we may exhaust that fire: that we may quench it, that we may have
boldness there. For there also it is not they who receive us, but our
own work: for that it is not simply their being our friends which can
save us, learn from what is added. For why did He not say, “Make to
yourselves friends, that they may receive you into their everlasting
habitations,” but added also the manner? For saying, “of the mammon of
unrighteousness,” He points out that we must make friends of them by
means of our possessions, showing that mere friendship will not protect
us, unless we have good works, unless we spend righteously the wealth
unrighteously gathered.

<span id="v.v-p47"></span>Moreover, this our discourse, of Almsgiving I
mean, fits not only the rich, but also the needy. Yea even if there be
any person who supporteth himself by begging, even for him is this word.
For there is no one, so poverty-stricken, however exceeding poor he may
be, as not to be able to provide “two mites.” ( [Luke xxi.
2](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#002) <span id="v.v-p47.1"></span> ..md)  It
is therefore possible that a person giving a small sum from small means,
should surpass those who have large possessions and give more; as that
widow did. For not by the measure of what is given, but by the means and
willingness of the givers is the extent of the alms-deed estimated. In
all cases the will is needed, in all, a right disposition; in all, love
towards God. If with this we do all things, though having little we give
little, God will not turn away His face, but will receive it as great
and admirable: for He regards the will, not the gifts: and if He see
that to be great, He assigneth His decrees and judges accordingly, and
maketh them partakers of His everlasting benefits.

<span id="v.v-p48"></span>Which may God grant us all to obtain, by the
grace and love of our Lord Jesus Christ, with whom to the Father
together with the Holy Ghost, be glory, power, honor, now and for ever,
and world without end. Amen.
