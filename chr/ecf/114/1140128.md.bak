<span id="v.xxxiv-p2"></span> <span id="v.xxxiv-p2.1"></span> <span
class="c1"><span id="v.xxxiv-p2.2"></span>[Hebrews xii.
11-13](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#011.md)<span
id="v.xxxiv-p2.3"></span></span>

<span id="v.xxxiv-p3"></span> *“No chastening for the present seemeth to
be joyous,*  <span id="fr_3393"></span>[3394](#fn_3393.md) *but grievous,*
 <span id="fr_3394"></span>[3395](#fn_3394.md) *nevertheless, afterward it
yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are*
 <span id="fr_3395"></span>[3396](#fn_3395.md) *exercised thereby.
Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees: and
make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out
of the way, but let it rather be healed.”*

<span id="v.xxxiv-p7"></span> \[1.\] <span class="c11"><span
id="v.xxxiv-p7.1"></span>They</span> who drink bitter medicines, first
submit to some unpleasantness, and afterwards feel the benefit. For such
is virtue, such is vice. In the latter there is first the pleasure, then
the despondency: in the former first the despondency, and then the
pleasure. But there is no equality; for it is not the same, to be first
grieved and afterwards pleased, and to be first pleased and afterwards
grieved. How so? because in the latter case the expectation of coming
despondency makes the present pleasure less: but in the former the
expectation of coming pleasure cuts away the violence of present
despondency; so that the result is that in the one instance we never
have pleasure, in the latter we never have grief. And the difference
does not lie in this only, but also in other ways. As how? That the
duration is not equal, but far greater and more ample. And here too, it
is still more so in things spiritual.

<span id="v.xxxiv-p8"></span>From this \[consideration\] then Paul
undertakes to console them; and again takes up the common judgment of
men, which no one is able to stand against, nor to contend with the
common decision, when one says what is acknowledged by all.

<span id="v.xxxiv-p9"></span>Ye are suffering, he says. For such is
chastisement; such is its beginning. For “no chastening for the present
seemeth to be joyous but grievous.” Well said he, “seemeth not.”
Chastisement he means is not grievous but “seemeth” so. “All
chastisement”: not this and that, but “all,” both human and spiritual.
Seest thou that he argues from our common notions? “Seemeth” (he says)
“to be grievous,” so that it is not \[really so\].  For what sort of
grief brings forth joy? So neither does pleasure bring forth
despondency.

<span id="v.xxxiv-p10"></span> “Nevertheless, afterward it yieldeth the
peaceable fruits of righteousness to them which have been exercised
thereby.” Not “fruit” but “fruits,”  <span
id="fr_3396"></span>[3397](#fn_3396.md) a great abundance.

<span id="v.xxxiv-p12"></span> “To them” (he says) “which have been
exercised thereby.” What is “to them which have been exercised thereby”?
To them that have endured for a long while, and been patient. And he
uses an auspicious  <span id="fr_3397"></span>[3398](#fn_3397.md)
expression. So then, chastisement is exercise, making the athlete
strong, and invincible in combats, irresistible in wars.

<span id="v.xxxiv-p14"></span> If then “all chastisement” be such, this
also will be such: so that we ought to look for good things, and for a
sweet and peaceful end. And do not wonder if, being itself hard, it has
sweet fruits; since in trees also the bark is almost destitute of all
quality,  <span id="fr_3398"></span>[3399](#fn_3398.md) and rough; but the
fruits are sweet. But he took it from the common notion. If therefore we
ought to look for such things, why do ye vex yourselves? Why, after ye
have endured the painful, do ye despond as to the good? The distasteful
things which ye had to endure, ye endured: do not then despond as to the
recompense.

<span id="v.xxxiv-p16"></span> He speaks as to runners, and boxers, and
warriors.  <span id="fr_3399"></span>[3400](#fn_3399.md) Seest thou how he
arms them, how he encourages them? “Walk straight,” he says. Here he
speaks with reference to their thoughts; that is to say, not doubting.
For if the chastisement be of love, if it begin from loving care, if it
end with a good result (and this he proves both by facts and by words,
and by all considerations), why are ye dispirited? For such are they who
despair, who are not strengthened by the hope of the future. “Walk
straight,” he says, that your lameness may not be increased, but brought
back to its former condition. For he that runs when he is lame, galls
the sore place. Seest thou that it is in our power to be thoroughly
healed?

<span id="v.xxxiv-p18"></span>\[2.\] [Heb.
12.14](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#014.md)<span id="v.xxxiv-p18.1"></span>
. “Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall
see the Lord.” What he also said above, “Not forsaking the assembling of
yourselves together” ( [Heb.
10.25](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#025.md)<span id="v.xxxiv-p18.2"></span>
), he hints at in this place also. For nothing so especially makes
persons easily vanquished and subdued in temptations, as isolation. For,
tell me, scatter a phalanx in war, and the enemy will need no trouble,
but will take them prisoners, coming on them separately, and thereby the
more helpless.

<span id="v.xxxiv-p19"></span> “Follow peace with all men, and holiness”
 <span id="fr_3400"></span>[3401](#fn_3400.md) <span id="page_504">p.
504</span> <span id="v.xxxiv-Page_504"></span> (he says). Therefore with
the evil-doers as well? “If it be possible,” he says, “as much as lieth
in you, live peaceably with all men.” ( [Rom. xii.
18](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#018) <span id="v.xxxiv-p20.5"></span> ..md)
For thy part (he means) “live peaceably,” doing no harm to religion: but
in whatever thou art ill-treated, bear it nobly. For the bearing with
evil is a great weapon in trials. Thus Christ also made His disciples
strong by saying, “Behold I send you forth as sheep in the midst of
wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves,” (
[Matt. x. 16](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#016.md) <span
id="v.xxxiv-p20.6"></span> .) What dost Thou say? Are we “among wolves,”
and dost Thou bid us to be “as sheep,” and “as doves”? Yea, He says. For
nothing so shames him that is doing us evil, as bearing nobly the things
which are brought upon us: and not avenging ourselves either by word or
by deed. This both makes us more philosophical ourselves and procures a
greater reward, and also benefits them. But has such an one been
insolent? Do thou bless \[him\]. See how much thou wilt gain from this:
thou hast quenched the evil, thou hast procured to thyself a reward,
thou hast made him ashamed, and thou hast suffered nothing serious.

<span id="v.xxxiv-p21"></span> \[3.\] “Follow peace with all men, and
holiness.” What does he mean by “holiness”  <span
id="fr_3401"></span>[3402](#fn_3401.md) ? Chaste, and orderly living in
marriage. If any person is unmarried (he says) let him remain pure, let
him marry: or if he be married, let him not commit fornication, but let
him live with his own wife: for this also is “holiness.” How? Marriage
is not “holiness,” but marriage preserves the holiness which
\[proceeds\] from Faith, not permitting union with a harlot. For
“marriage is honorable” ( [Heb.
13.4](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#004.md)<span id="v.xxxiv-p22.7"></span>
), not holy. Marriage is pure: it does not however also give holiness,
except by forbidding the defilement of that \[holiness\] which has been
given by our Faith.

<span id="v.xxxiv-p23"></span>“Without which” (he says) “no man shall
see the Lord.” Which he also says in the \[Epistle\] to the Corinthians.
“Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor adulterers, nor idolaters,
nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor covetous
persons, nor thieves, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners,
shall inherit the kingdom of God.” ( [1 Cor.
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#009.md),
[10](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#010)<span id="v.xxxiv-p23.1"></span> ..md)
For how shall he who has become the body of a harlot, how shall he be
able to be the body of Christ?

<span id="v.xxxiv-p24"></span>\[4.\] [Heb.
12.15](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#015.md)<span id="v.xxxiv-p24.1"></span>
. “Looking diligently  <span id="fr_3402"></span>[3403](#fn_3402.md) lest
any man come short of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness
springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled: lest there be any
fornicator or profane person.” Dost thou see how everywhere he puts the
common salvation into the hands of each individual? “Exhorting one
another daily” (he says) “while it is called To-day.” ( [Heb.
3.13](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#013.md)<span id="v.xxxiv-p25.3"></span>
.) Do not then cast all \[the burden\] on your teachers; do not \[cast\]
all upon them who have the rule over you: ye also (he means) are able to
edify one another. Which also he said in writing to the Thessalonians,
“Edify one another, even as also ye do.” ( [1 Thess. v.
11](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#011) <span id="v.xxxiv-p25.4"></span> ..md)
And again, “Comfort one another with these words.” ( [1 Thess. iv.
18](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#018) <span id="v.xxxiv-p25.5"></span> ..md)
This we also now exhort you.

<span id="v.xxxiv-p26"></span>\[5.\] If ye be willing, ye will have more
success with each other than we can have. For ye both are with one
another for a longer time, and ye know more than we of each other’s
affairs, and ye are not ignorant of each other’s failings, and ye have
more freedom of speech, and love, and intimacy; and these are no small
\[advantages\] for teaching, but great and opportune introductions for
it: ye will be more able than we both to reprove and to exhort. And not
this only, but because I am but one, whereas ye are many; and ye will be
able, however many, to be teachers. Wherefore I entreat you, do not
“neglect this gift.” ( [1 Tim. iv. 14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#014.md)
<span id="v.xxxiv-p26.1"></span> .) Each one of you has a wife, has a
friend, has a servant, has a neighbor; let him reprove him, let him
exhort him.

<span id="v.xxxiv-p27"></span> For how is it not absurd, with regard to
\[bodily\] nourishment, to make associations for messing together, and
for drinking together, and to have a set day whereon to club with one
another, as they say, and to make up by the association what each person
being alone by himself fails short of—as for instance, if it be
necessary to go to a funeral, or to a dinner, or to assist a neighbor in
any matter—and not to do this for the purpose of instruction in virtue? 
Yea, I entreat you, let no man neglect it. For great is the reward he
receives from God. And that thou mayest understand, he who was entrusted
with the five talents is the teacher: and he with the one is the
learner. If the learner should say, I am a learner, I run no risk, and
should hide the reason,  <span id="fr_3403"></span>[3404](#fn_3403.md)
which he received of God, that common and simple \[reason\], and give no
advice, should not speak plainly, should not rebuke, should not
admonish, if he is able, but should bury \[his talents\] in the earth
(for truly that heart is earth and ashes, which hides the gift of God):
if then he hides it either from indolence, or from wickedness, it will
be no defense to him to say, ‘I had but one talent.’ Thou hadst one
talent. Thou oughtest then to have brought one besides, and to have
doubled the talent. If thou hadst brought one in addition, thou wouldst
not have been blamed. For neither did He say to him who brought the two,
Wherefore hast thou not brought five? But He <span id="page_505">p.
505</span> <span id="v.xxxiv-Page_505"></span> accounted him of the same
worth with him who brought the five. Why? Because he gained as much as
he had. And, because he had received fewer than the one entrusted with
the five, he was not on this account negligent, nor did he use the
smallness \[of his trust, as an excuse\] for idleness. And thou oughtest
not to have looked to him who had the two; or rather, thou oughtest to
have looked to him, and as he having two imitated him who had five, so
oughtest thou to have emulated him who had two. For if for him who has
means and does not give, there is punishment, how shall there not be the
greatest punishment for him who is able to exhort in any way, and does
it not? In the former case the body is nourished, in the latter the
soul; there thou preventest temporal death, here eternal.

<span id="v.xxxiv-p29"></span> \[6.\] But I have no \[skill of\] speech,
 <span id="fr_3404"></span>[3405](#fn_3404.md) you say. But there is no
need of \[skill of\] speech nor of eloquence. If thou see a friend going
into fornication, say to him, Thou art going after an evil thing; art
thou not ashamed? Dost thou not blush? This is wrong. ‘Why, does he not
know’ (you say) ‘that it is wrong?’ Yes, but he is dragged on by lust.
They that are sick also know that it is bad to drink cold water,
nevertheless they need persons who shall hinder \[them from it\]. For he
who is suffering, will not easily be able to help himself in his
sickness. There is need therefore of thee who art in health, for his
cure. And if he be not persuaded by thy words, watch for him as he goes
away and hold him fast; peradventure he will be ashamed.

<span id="v.xxxiv-p31"></span>‘And what advantage is it’ (you say),
‘when he does this for my sake, and because he has been held back by
me?’ Do not be too minute in thy calculations. For a while, by whatever
means, withdraw him from his evil practice; let him be accustomed not to
go off to that pit, whether through thee, or through any means whatever.
When thou hast accustomed him not to go, then by taking him after he has
gained breath a little thou wilt be able to teach him that he ought to
do this for God’s sake, and not for man’s. Do not wish to make all right
at once, since you cannot: but do it gently and by degrees.

<span id="v.xxxiv-p32"></span> If thou see him going off to drinking, or
to parties where there is nothing but drunkenness, then also do the
same; and again on the other hand intreat him, if he observe that thou
hast any failing, to help thee and set thee right. For in this way, he
will even of himself, bear reproof, when he sees both that thou needest
reproofs as well, and that thou helpest him, not as one that had done
everything right, nor as a teacher, but as a friend and a brother. Say
to him, I have done thee a service, in reminding thee of things
expedient: do thou also, whatever failing thou seest me have, hold me
back,  <span id="fr_3405"></span>[3406](#fn_3405.md) set me right. If thou
see me irritable, if avaricious, restrain me, bind me by exhortation.

<span id="v.xxxiv-p34"></span>This is friendship; thus “brother aided by
brother becomes a fortified city.” ( [Prov. xviii.
19](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#019) <span id="v.xxxiv-p34.1"></span> ..md)
For not eating and drinking makes friendship: such friendship even
robbers have and murderers. But if we are friends, if we truly care for
one another, let us in these respects help one another. This leads us to
a profitable friendship: let us hinder those things which lead away to
hell.

<span id="v.xxxiv-p35"></span> \[7.\] Therefore let not him that is
reproved be indignant: for we are men and we have failings; neither let
him who reproves do it as exulting over him and making a display, but
privately, with gentleness. He that reproves has need of greater
gentleness, that thus he may persuade \[them\] to bear the cutting. Do
you not see surgeons, when they burn, when they cut, with how great
gentleness they apply their treatment? Much more ought those who reprove
others to act thus. For reproof is sharper even than fire and knife, and
makes \[men\] start. On this account surgeons take great pains to make
them bear the cutting quietly, and apply it as tenderly as possible,
even giving in  <span id="fr_3406"></span>[3407](#fn_3406.md) a little,
then giving time to take breath.

<span id="v.xxxiv-p37"></span>So ought we also to offer reproofs, that
the reproved may not start away. Even if therefore, it be necessary to
be insulted, yea even to be struck, let us not decline it. For those
also who are cut \[by the surgeons\] utter numberless cries against
those who are cutting them; they however heed none of these things, but
only the health of the patients. So indeed in this case also we ought to
do all things that our reproof may be effectual, to bear all things,
looking to the reward which is in store.

<span id="v.xxxiv-p38"></span>“Bear ye one another’s burdens,” saith he,
“and so fulfill the law of Christ.” ( [Gal. vi.
2](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#002) <span id="v.xxxiv-p38.1"></span> ..md)
So then, both reproving and bearing with one another, shall we be able
to fulfill edification. And thus will ye make the labor light for us, in
all things taking a part with us, and stretching out a hand, and
becoming sharers and partakers, both in one another’s salvation, and
each one in his own. Let us then endure patiently, both bearing “one
another’s burdens,” and reproving: that we may attain to the good things
promised in Christ Jesus our Lord, with whom to the Father together with
the Holy Ghost, be glory, might, honor, now and for ever and world
without end. Amen.
