<span id="iv.xlviii-p1"></span> <span class="c15"><span
id="iv.xlviii-p1.1"></span>Homily XLVI.</span>

<span id="iv.xlviii-p2"></span> <span id="iv.xlviii-p2.1"></span> <span
class="c1"><span id="iv.xlviii-p2.2"></span>[John
6:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#041.md),
[42](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#042.md)<span
id="iv.xlviii-p2.3"></span></span>

<span id="iv.xlviii-p3"></span>“The Jews then murmured at Him, because
He said, I am the Bread which came down from heaven; and they said, Is
not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How
is it then that He saith, I came down from heaven?”

<span id="iv.xlviii-p4"></span> \[1.\] “ <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.xlviii-p4.1"></span>Whose</span> god is their belly, and whose
glory is in their shame” ( [Philip. iii.
19](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#019.md) <span id="iv.xlviii-p4.2"></span>
), said Paul of certain persons, writing to the Philippians.  <span
id="fr_1285"></span>[1286](#fn_1285.md) Now that the Jews were of this
character is clear, both from what has gone before, and from what they
came and said to Christ. For when He gave them bread, and filled their
bellies, they said that He was a Prophet, and sought to make Him a King:
but when He taught them concerning spiritual food, concerning eternal
life, when He led them away from objects of sense, and spake to them of
a resurrection, and raised their thoughts to higher matters, when most
they ought to have admired, they murmur and start away. And yet, if He
was that Prophet as they before asserted, declaring that he it was of
whom Moses had said, “A Prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto
you of your brethren like unto me, unto Him shall ye hearken” ( [Deut.
xviii. 15](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#015.md) <span
id="iv.xlviii-p5.3"></span> ); they ought to have hearkened to Him when
He said, “I came down from heaven”; yet they hearkened not, but
murmured. They still reverenced Him, because the miracle of the loaves
was recent, and therefore they did not openly gainsay Him, but by
murmuring expressed their displeasure, that He did not give them the
meal which they desired. And murmuring they said, “Is not this the son
of Joseph?” Whence it is plain, that as yet they knew not of His strange
and marvelous Generation. And so they still say that He is the son of
Joseph, and are not rebuked; and He saith not to them, “I am not the Son
of Joseph”; not because He was his son, but because they were not as yet
able to hear of that marvelous Birth. And if they could not bear to hear
in plain terms of His birth according to the flesh, much less could they
hear of that ineffable Birth which is from above. If He revealed not
that which was lower to them, much less would He commit to them the
other. Although this greatly offended them, that He was born from a mean
and common father, still He revealed not to them the truth, lest in
removing one cause of offense He should create another.  What then said
He when they murmured?

<span id="iv.xlviii-p6"></span> [John
6.44](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#044.md)<span id="iv.xlviii-p6.1"></span>
. “No man can come unto Me, except the Father which hath sent Me draw
Him.”

<span id="iv.xlviii-p7"></span> The Manichæans spring upon these words,
saying, “that nothing lies in our own power”; yet the expression showeth
that we are masters of our will. “For if a man cometh to Him,” saith
some one, “what need is there of drawing?” But the words do not take
away our free will, but show that we greatly need assistance. And He
implieth not an unwilling  <span id="fr_1286"></span>[1287](#fn_1286.md)
comer, but one enjoying much succor. Then He showeth also the manner in
which He draweth; for that men may not, again, form any material idea of
God, He addeth,

<span id="iv.xlviii-p9"></span> [John
6.46](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#046.md)<span id="iv.xlviii-p9.1"></span>
. “Not that any man hath seen God,  <span
id="fr_1287"></span>[1288](#fn_1287.md) save He which is of God, He hath
seen the Father.”

<span id="iv.xlviii-p11"></span>“How then,” saith some one, “doth the
Father draw?” This the Prophet explained of old, when he proclaimed
beforehand, and said,

<span id="iv.xlviii-p12"></span> [John
6.45](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#045.md)<span id="iv.xlviii-p12.1"></span>
. “They shall all be taught of God.” ( [Isa. liv.
13](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#013.md) <span id="iv.xlviii-p12.2"></span>
.)

<span id="iv.xlviii-p13"></span> Seest thou the dignity of faith, and
that not of men nor by man, but by God Himself they shall  <span
id="fr_1288"></span>[1289](#fn_1288.md) learn this? And to make this
assertion credible, He referred them to their prophets. “If then ‘all
shall be taught of God,’ how is it that some shall not believe?” Because
the words are spoken of the greater number. Besides, the prophecy
meaneth not absolutely all, but all that have the will. For the teacher
sitteth ready to impart what he hath to all, and pouring forth his
instruction unto all.

<span id="iv.xlviii-p15"></span> <span id="page_163">p. 163</span> <span
id="iv.xlviii-Page_163"></span>[John
6.44](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#044.md)<span id="iv.xlviii-p15.1"></span>
. “And I will raise him up in the last day.”

<span id="iv.xlviii-p16"></span> Not slight here is the authority of the
Son, if so be that the Father leadeth, He raiseth up. He distinguisheth
not His working from that of the Father, (how could that be?) but
showeth equality  <span id="fr_1289"></span>[1290](#fn_1289.md) of power.
As, therefore, after saying in that other place, “The Father which hath
sent Me beareth witness of Me,” He then, that they might not be
over-curious about the utterance, referred them to the Scriptures; so
here, that they may not entertain similar suspicions, He referreth them
to the Prophets, whom He continually and everywhere quoteth, to show
that He is not opposed to the Father.

<span id="iv.xlviii-p18"></span> “But what of those,” saith some one,
“who were before His time?  Were not they taught of God? why then the
special application of the words here?” Because of old they learned the
things of God by the hands of men, but now by the Only-begotten Son of
God, and by the Holy Ghost. Then He addeth, “Not that any man hath seen
the Father, save He which is of God,”  <span
id="fr_1290"></span>[1291](#fn_1290.md) using this expression here not with
reference to the cause, but to the manner of being.  <span
id="fr_1291"></span>[1292](#fn_1291.md) Since had He spoken in the former
sense, we are all “of God.” And where then would be the special and
distinct nature of the Son? “But wherefore,” saith some one, “did He not
put this more clearly?” Because of their weakness. For if when He said,
“I am come down from heaven,” they were so offended, what would they
have felt had He added this?

<span id="iv.xlviii-p21"></span>He calleth Himself, ( [John
6.48](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#048.md)<span id="iv.xlviii-p21.1"></span>
,) “the bread of life,” because He maintaineth  <span
id="fr_1292"></span>[1293](#fn_1292.md) our life both which is and which is
to be, and saith, “Whosoever  <span id="fr_1293"></span>[1294](#fn_1293.md)
shall eat of this bread shall live for ever.” By “bread” He meaneth here
either His saving doctrines and the faith which is in Him, or His own
Body; for both nerve the soul. Yet in another place He said, “If a man
hear  <span id="fr_1294"></span>[1295](#fn_1294.md) My saying, he shall
never taste of death.” ( [John
8.51](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#051.md)<span id="iv.xlviii-p24.3"></span>
.) And they were offended; here they had no such feeling perhaps,
because they yet respected Him on account of the loaves which had been
made.

<span id="iv.xlviii-p25"></span>\[2.\] And observe how He distinguisheth
between His bread and the manna, by causing them to hear the result of
each kind of food. For to show that the manna afforded them no unusual
advantage, He added,

<span id="iv.xlviii-p26"></span> [John
6.49](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#049.md)<span id="iv.xlviii-p26.1"></span>
. “Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.”

<span id="iv.xlviii-p27"></span>He then establisheth a thing most likely
to persuade them, that they were deemed worthy of greater things than
their fathers, (meaning those marvelous men who lived in the time of
Moses,) and so, after saying that they were dead who ate the manna, He
addeth,

<span id="iv.xlviii-p28"></span> [John
6.51](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#051.md)<span id="iv.xlviii-p28.1"></span>
. “He that eateth  <span id="fr_1295"></span>[1296](#fn_1295.md) of this
bread, shall live for ever.”

<span id="iv.xlviii-p30"></span>Nor hath He put “in the wilderness”
without a cause, but to point out that the supply of manna was not
extended to a long time, nor entered with them into the land of promise.
But this “bread” was not of the same kind.

<span id="iv.xlviii-p31"></span>“And the bread that I will give is My
flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.”

<span id="iv.xlviii-p32"></span>Here one might reasonably enquire, how
this was a fit season for these words, which neither edified nor
profited, but rather did mischief to those who had been edified; for
“from that time,” saith the Evangelist, “many of His disciples went
back,” saying, “This is a hard saying; who can hear it?” ( [John
6.60](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#060.md)<span id="iv.xlviii-p32.1"></span>
); since these things might have been entrusted to the disciples only,
as Matthew hath told us that He discoursed with them apart. ( [Mark
4:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#034.md), [Matt.
13:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#036.md)<span
id="iv.xlviii-p32.2"></span> .) What then shall we say? What is the
profit of the words? Great is the profit and necessity of them. Because
they pressed upon Him, asking for bodily food, reminding Him of the food
provided in the days of their forefathers, and speaking of the manna as
a great thing, to show them that all those things were but type and
shadow, but that the very reality of the matter was now present with
them, He mentioneth spiritual food. “But,” saith some one, “he ought to
have said, Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, but I have
given you bread.” But the interval between the two miracles was great,
and the latter of them would have appeared inferior to the former,
because the manna came down from heaven, but this, the miracle of the
loaves, was wrought on earth. When therefore they sought food “coming
down from heaven,” He continually told them, “I came down from heaven.”
And if any one enquire why He introduced the discourse on the Mysteries,
we will reply, that this was a very fitting time for such discourses;
for indistinctness in what is said always rouses the hearer, and renders
him more attentive. They ought not then to have been offended, but
rather to have asked and enquired. But now they went back. If they
believed Him to be a Prophet, they ought to have believed His words, so
that the offense was caused by their own folly, not by any difficulty in
the words.  And observe how by little and little He led them up to
Himself. Here He saith that Himself giveth, not the Father;  <span
id="fr_1296"></span>[1297](#fn_1296.md) “The <span id="page_164">p.
164</span> <span id="iv.xlviii-Page_164"></span> bread that I will give
is My flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.”

<span id="iv.xlviii-p34"></span> “But,” saith some one, “this doctrine
was strange to them and unusual.”  <span
id="fr_1297"></span>[1298](#fn_1297.md) And yet John at an earlier period
alluded to it by calling Him “Lamb.” ( [John
1.29](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#029.md)<span id="iv.xlviii-p35.7"></span>
.)  “But for all that, they knew it not.” I know they did not; nay,
neither did the disciples understand. For if as yet they had no clear
knowledge of the Resurrection, and so knew not what, “Destroy this
Temple, and in three days I will raise it up” ( [John ii.
19](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#019.md) <span id="iv.xlviii-p35.8"></span>
), might mean, much more would they be ignorant of what is said here.
For these words were less clear than those. Since that prophets had
raised men  <span id="fr_1298"></span>[1299](#fn_1298.md) from the dead,
they knew, even if the Scriptures have not spoken so clearly on the
subject, but not one of them ever asserted that any man had eaten flesh.
Still they obeyed, and followed Him, and confessed that He had the words
of eternal life. For this is a disciple’s part, not to be over-curious
about the assertions of his teacher, but to hear and obey him, and to
wait the proper time for the solution of any difficulties. “How then,”
saith some one, “was it that the contrary came to pass, and that these
men ‘went back’?” It was by reason of their folly. For when questioning
concerning the “how” comes in, there comes in with it unbelief. So
Nicodemus was perplexed, saying, “How can a man enter into his mother’s
womb?” So also these are confounded, saying,

<span id="iv.xlviii-p37"></span> [John
6.52](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#052.md)<span id="iv.xlviii-p37.1"></span>
. “How can this man give us his flesh to eat?”

<span id="iv.xlviii-p38"></span>If thou seekest to know the “how,” why
askedst not thou this in the matter of the loaves, how He extended five
to so great a number? Because they then only thought of being satisfied,
not of seeing the miracle. “But,” saith some one, “their experience then
taught them.” Then by reason of that experience these words ought to
have been readily received. For to this end He wrought beforehand that
strange miracle, that taught by it they might no longer disbelieve what
should be said by Him afterwards.

<span id="iv.xlviii-p39"></span>\[3.\] Those men then at that time
reaped no fruit from what was said, but we have enjoyed the benefit in
the very realities. Wherefore it is necessary to understand the marvel
of the Mysteries, what it is, why it was given, and what is the profit
of the action. We become one Body, and “members of His flesh and of His
bones.” ( [Eph. v. 30](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#030.md) <span
id="iv.xlviii-p39.1"></span> .) Let the initiated  <span
id="fr_1299"></span>[1300](#fn_1299.md) follow what I say. In order then
that we may become this not by love only, but in very deed, let us be
blended  <span id="fr_1300"></span>[1301](#fn_1300.md) into that flesh.
This is effected by the food which He hath freely given us, desiring to
show the love which He hath for us. On this account He hath mixed up
Himself with us; He hath kneaded up  <span
id="fr_1301"></span>[1302](#fn_1301.md) His body with ours, that we might
be a certain One Thing,  <span id="fr_1302"></span>[1303](#fn_1302.md) like
a body joined to a head. For this belongs to  <span
id="fr_1303"></span>[1304](#fn_1303.md) them who love strongly; this, for
instance, Job implied, speaking of his servants, by whom he was beloved
so exceedingly, that they desired to cleave unto his flesh. For they
said, to show the strong love which they felt, “Who would give us to be
satisfied with his flesh?” ( [Job xxxi.
31](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#031.md) <span id="iv.xlviii-p44.3"></span>
.) Wherefore this also Christ hath done, to lead us to a closer
friendship, and to show His love for us; He hath given to those who
desire Him not only to see Him, but even to touch, and eat Him, and fix
their teeth in His flesh, and to embrace Him, and satisfy all their
love. Let us then return from that table like lions breathing fire,
having become terrible to the devil; thinking on our Head, and on the
love which He hath shown for us. Parents often entrust their offspring
to others to feed; “but I,” saith He, “do not so, I feed you with Mine
own flesh, desiring that you all be nobly born,  <span
id="fr_1304"></span>[1305](#fn_1304.md) and holding forth to you good hopes
for the future. For He who giveth out Himself to you here, much more
will do so hereafter. I have willed to become your Brother, for your
sake I shared in flesh and blood, and in turn I give out to you the
flesh and the blood by which I became your kinsman.” This blood causeth
the image of our King to be fresh  <span
id="fr_1305"></span>[1306](#fn_1305.md) within us, produceth beauty
unspeakable, permitteth not the nobleness of our souls to waste away,
watering it continually, and nourishing it. The blood derived from our
food becomes not at once blood, but something else; while this doth not
so, but straightway watereth our souls, and worketh in them some mighty
power. This  <span id="fr_1306"></span>[1307](#fn_1306.md) blood, if
rightly taken, driveth away devils, and keepeth them afar off from us,
while it calleth to us Angels and the Lord of Angels. For wherever they
see the Lord’s blood, devils flee, and Angels run together. This blood
poured forth washed clean all the world; many wise sayings did the
blessed Paul utter concerning it in the Epistle to the Hebrews. This
blood cleansed the secret place, and the Holy of Holies. And if the type
of it had such great power in the temple of the Hebrews, and in the
midst of Egypt, when smeared on the door-posts, much more the reality.
This blood sanctified the golden altar; without it the high priest dared
not enter into the secret place. This blood consecrated  <span
id="fr_1307"></span>[1308](#fn_1307.md) priests, this in types cleansed
 <span id="fr_1308"></span>[1309](#fn_1308.md) sins. But if it had such
power in the <span id="page_165">p. 165</span> <span
id="iv.xlviii-Page_165"></span> types, if death so shuddered at the
shadow, tell me how would it not have dreaded the very reality? This
blood is the salvation of our souls, by this the soul is washed,  <span
id="fr_1309"></span>[1310](#fn_1309.md) by this is beautiful, by this is
inflamed, this causeth our understanding to be more bright than fire,
and our soul more beaming than gold; this blood was poured forth, and
made heaven accessible.

<span id="iv.xlviii-p51"></span> \[4.\] Awful in truth are the Mysteries
of the Church, awful in truth is the Altar. A fountain went up out of
Paradise sending forth  <span id="fr_1310"></span>[1311](#fn_1310.md)
material rivers, from this table springeth up a fountain which sendeth
forth rivers spiritual. By the side of this fountain are planted not
fruitless willows, but trees reaching even to heaven, bearing fruit ever
timely and undecaying. If any be scorched with heat, let him come to the
side of this fountain and cool his burning. For it quencheth drought,
and comforteth  <span id="fr_1311"></span>[1312](#fn_1311.md) all things
that are burnt up, not by the sun, but by the fiery darts. For it hath
its beginning from above, and its source is there, whence also its water
floweth. Many are the streams of that fountain which the Comforter
sendeth forth, and the Son is the Mediator, not holding mattock to clear
the way, but opening our minds. This fountain is a fountain of light,
spouting forth rays of truth. By it stand the Powers on high looking
upon the beauty of its streams, because they more clearly perceive the
power of the Things set forth, and the flashings unapproachable. For as
when gold is being molten if one should (were it possible) dip in it his
hand or his tongue, he would immediately render them golden; thus, but
in much greater degree, doth what here is set forth work upon the soul.
Fiercer than fire the river boileth up, yet burneth not, but only
baptizeth that on which it layeth hold. This blood was ever typified of
old in the altars and sacrifices  <span
id="fr_1312"></span>[1313](#fn_1312.md) of righteous men, This is the price
of the world, by This Christ purchased to Himself the Church, by This He
hath adorned Her all. For as a man buying servants giveth gold for them,
and again when he desireth to deck them out doth this also with gold; so
Christ hath purchased us with His blood, and adorned us with His blood.
They who share this blood stand with Angels and Archangels and the
Powers that are above, clothed in Christ’s own kingly robe, and having
the armor of the Spirit. Nay, I have not as yet said any great thing:
they are clothed with the King Himself.

<span id="iv.xlviii-p55"></span>Now as this is a great and wonderful
thing, so if thou approach it with pureness, thou approachest for
salvation; but if with an evil conscience, for punishment and vengeance.
“For,” It saith, “he that eateth and drinketh unworthily” of the Lord,
“eateth and drinketh judgment to himself” ( [1 Cor. xi.
29](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#029.md) <span id="iv.xlviii-p55.1"></span>
); since if they who defile the kingly purple are punished equally with
those who rend it, it is not  <span id="fr_1313"></span>[1314](#fn_1313.md)
unreasonable that they who receive the Body with unclean thoughts should
suffer the same punishment as those who rent it with the nails. Observe
at least how fearful a punishment Paul declareth, when he saith, “He
that despised Moses’ law dieth without mercy under two or three
witnesses; of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought
worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the
blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing?” (
[Heb. i. 28](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#028.md) <span
id="iv.xlviii-p56.3"></span> .) Take we then heed to ourselves, beloved,
we who enjoy such blessings; and if we desire to utter any shameful
word, or perceive ourselves hurried away by wrath or any like passion,
let us consider of what things we have been deemed worthy, of how great
a Spirit we have partaken, and this consideration shall be a sobering of
our unreasonable passions. For how long shall we be nailed to present
things? How long shall it be before we rouse ourselves? How long shall
we neglect our own salvation? Let us bear in mind of what things Christ
has deemed us worthy, let us give thanks, let us glorify Him, not by our
faith alone, but also by our very works, that we may obtain the good
things that are to come, through the grace and lovingkindness of our
Lord Jesus Christ, by whom and with whom, to the Father and the Holy
Ghost be glory, now and ever and world without end. Amen.
