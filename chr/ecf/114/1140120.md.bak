<span id="v.xxvi-p2"></span> <span id="v.xxvi-p2.1"></span> <span
class="c1"><span id="v.xxvi-p2.2"></span>[Heb.
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#003.md),
[4](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#004.md)<span
id="v.xxvi-p2.3"></span></span>

<span id="v.xxvi-p3"></span> *“Through faith we understand that the
worlds were framed by the word of God; so that things which are seen
were not made of things which do appear. By faith Abel offered unto God
a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness*
 <span id="fr_3199"></span>[3200](#fn_3199.md) *that he was righteous, God
testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh.”*  <span
id="fr_3200"></span>[3201](#fn_3200.md)

<span id="v.xxvi-p6"></span> \[1.\] <span class="c11"><span
id="v.xxvi-p6.1"></span>Faith  <span
id="fr_3201"></span>[3202](#fn_3201.md) </span> needs a generous and
vigorous soul, and one rising above all things of sense, and passing
beyond the weakness of human reasonings. For it is not possible to
become a believer, otherwise than by raising one’s self above the common
customs \[of the world\].

<span id="v.xxvi-p8"></span>Inasmuch then as the souls of the Hebrews
were thoroughly weakened, and though they had begun from faith, yet from
circumstances, I mean sufferings, afflictions, they had afterwards
become faint-hearted, and of little spirit, and were shaken from \[their
position\], he encouraged them first indeed from these very things,
saying, “Call to remembrance the former days” ( [Heb.
10.32](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#032)<span id="v.xxvi-p8.1"></span> .md);
next from the Scripture saying, “But the just shall live by faith” (
[Heb. 10.38](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#038.md)<span
id="v.xxvi-p8.2"></span> ); afterwards from arguments, saying, “But
Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not
seen.” ( [Heb. 11.1](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#001.md)<span
id="v.xxvi-p8.3"></span> .) And now again from their forefathers, those
great and admirable men, as much as saying; If where the good things
were close at hand, all were saved by faith, much more are we.

<span id="v.xxvi-p9"></span> For when a soul finds one that shares the
same sufferings with itself, it is refreshed and recovers breath. This
we may see both in the case of Faith, and in the case of affliction:
“that there may be comfort for you  <span
id="fr_3202"></span>[3203](#fn_3202.md) it is said through our mutual
faith.” ( [Rom. i. 12](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#012.md) <span
id="v.xxvi-p10.9"></span> .) For mankind are very distrustful, and
cannot place confidence in themselves, are fearful about whatever things
they think they possess, and have great regard for the opinion of the
many.

<span id="v.xxvi-p11"></span> \[2.\] What then does Paul do? He
encourages them by the fathers; and before that by the common notions
\[of mankind\].  <span id="fr_3203"></span>[3204](#fn_3203.md) For tell me,
he says, since Faith is calumniated  <span
id="fr_3204"></span>[3205](#fn_3204.md) as being a thing without
demonstration  <span id="fr_3205"></span>[3206](#fn_3205.md) and rather a
matter of deceit, therefore he shows that the greatest things are
attained through faith and not through reasonings. And how does he show
this, tell me?  <span id="fr_3206"></span>[3207](#fn_3206.md) It is
manifest, he saith, that God made the things which are, out of things
which are not,  <span id="fr_3207"></span>[3208](#fn_3207.md) things which
appear, out of things which appear not, things which subsist, out of
things which subsist not. But whence \[is it shown\] that He did this
even “by a Word”? For reason suggests nothing of this kind; but on the
contrary, that the things which appear are \[formed\] out of things
which appear.

<span id="v.xxvi-p17"></span> Therefore the philosophers expressly say
that ‘nothing comes out of things that are not’  <span
id="fr_3208"></span>[3209](#fn_3208.md) being “sensual” ( [Jude
19](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#019) <span id="v.xxvi-p18.2"></span> .md),
and trusting nothing to Faith. And yet these same men, when they happen
to say anything great and noble, are caught entrusting it to Faith. For
instance, that “God is without beginning,  <span
id="fr_3209"></span>[3210](#fn_3209.md) and unborn”  <span
id="fr_3210"></span>[3211](#fn_3210.md) ; for reason does not suggest this,
but the contrary. And consider, I beseech you, their great folly. They
say  <span id="fr_3211"></span>[3212](#fn_3211.md) that God is without
beginning; and yet this is far more wonderful than the \[creation\] out
of things that are not. For to say, that He is without beginning, that
He is unborn, neither begotten by Himself nor by another is more full of
difficulties,  <span id="fr_3212"></span>[3213](#fn_3212.md) than to say
that God made the things which are, out of things which are not. For
here there are many things uncertain: as, that some one made it, that
what was made had a beginning, that, in a word, it was made. But in the
other case, what? He is self-existing,  <span
id="fr_3213"></span>[3214](#fn_3213.md) unborn, He neither had beginning
nor time; tell me, do not these things require faith? But he did not
assert this, which was far greater, but the lesser.

<span id="v.xxvi-p24"></span>Whence \[does it appear\], he would say,
that God made these things? Reason does not suggest it; no one was
present when it was done. Whence is it shown? It is plainly the result
of faith. “Through faith we understand that the worlds were made.” Why
“through faith”? Because “the things that are seen were not made of
things which do appear.” For this is Faith.

<span id="v.xxvi-p25"></span>\[3.\] Having thus stated the general
\[princi <span id="page_466">p. 466</span> <span
id="v.xxvi-Page_466"></span> ple\],  <span
id="fr_3214"></span>[3215](#fn_3214.md) he afterwards tests  <span
id="fr_3215"></span>[3216](#fn_3215.md) it by individuals. For a man of
note is equivalent to the world. This at all events he afterwards
hinted. For when he had matched it against one or two hundred persons,
and then saw the smallness of the number, he afterwards says, “by whom
the world was outweighed in worth.”  <span
id="fr_3216"></span>[3217](#fn_3216.md) ( [Heb.
11.38](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#038.md)<span id="v.xxvi-p28.7"></span>
.)

<span id="v.xxvi-p29"></span> And observe whom he puts first, him who
was ill-treated, and that by a brother. It was their own affliction,
 <span id="fr_3217"></span>[3218](#fn_3217) “For you also” (he says.md)
“have suffered like things of your own countrymen.” ( [1 Thess. ii.
14](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#014) <span id="v.xxvi-p30.2"></span> ..md)
And by a brother who had been nothing wronged, but who envied him on
God’s account; showing that they also are looked on with an evil eye and
envied. He honored God, and died because he honored Him: and has not yet
attained to a resurrection. But his readiness is manifest, and his part
 <span id="fr_3218"></span>[3219](#fn_3218.md) has been done, but God’s
part has not yet been carried out towards him.

<span id="v.xxvi-p32"></span>And by a “more excellent sacrifice” in this
place, he means that which is more honorable, more splendid, more
necessary.

<span id="v.xxvi-p33"></span>And we cannot say (he says) that it was not
accepted. He did accept it, and said unto Cain, \[“Hast thou\] not
\[sinned\], if thou rightly offer, but dost not rightly divide?” ( [Gen.
iv. 7](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#007.md) <span id="v.xxvi-p33.1"></span>
, LXX.) So then Abel both rightly offered, and rightly divided.
Nevertheless for this, what recompense did he receive? He was slain by
his brother’s hand: and that sentence which his father endured on
account of sin, this he first received who was upright. And he suffered
so much the more grievously because it was from a brother, and he was
the first \[to suffer\].

<span id="v.xxvi-p34"></span>And he did these things rightly looking to
no man. For to whom could he look, when he so honored God? To his father
and his mother? But they had outraged Him in return for His benefits. To
his brother then? But he also had dishonored \[God\]. So that by himself
he sought out what was good.

<span id="v.xxvi-p35"></span>And he that is worthy of so great honor,
what does he suffer? He is put to death. And how too was he otherwise
“testified of that he was righteous”? It is said, that fire came down
and consumed the sacrifices. For instead of \[“And the Lord\] had
respect to Abel and to his sacrifices” ( [Gen. iv.
4](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#004) <span id="v.xxvi-p35.1"></span> .md),
the Syriac  <span id="fr_3219"></span>[3220](#fn_3219.md) said, “And He set
them on fire.” He therefore who both by word and deed bare witness to
the righteous man and sees him slain for His sake, did not avenge him,
but left him to suffer.

<span id="v.xxvi-p37"></span>But your case is not such: for how could it
be? You who have both prophets and examples, and encouragements
innumerable, and signs and miracles accomplished? Hence that was faith
indeed. For what miracles did he see, that he might believe he should
have any recompense of good things? Did he not choose virtue from Faith
alone?

<span id="v.xxvi-p38"></span> What is, “and by it he being dead yet
speaketh”? That he might not cast them into great despondency, he shows
that he has in part obtained a recompense. How? ‘The influence coming
from him  <span id="fr_3220"></span>[3221](#fn_3220.md) is great, he means,
“and he yet speaketh”; that is, \[Cain\] slew him, but he did not with
him slay his glory and memory. He is not dead; therefore neither shall
ye die. For by how much the more grievous a man’s sufferings are, so
much the greater is his glory.’

<span id="v.xxvi-p40"></span>How does he “yet speak”? This is a sign
both of his being alive, and of his being by all celebrated, admired,
counted blessed. For he who encourages others to be righteous, speaks.
For no speech avails so much, as that man’s suffering. As then heaven by
its mere appearance speaks, so also does he by being had in remembrance.
Not if he had made proclamation of himself, not if he had ten thousand
tongues, and were alive, would he have been so admired as now. That is,
these things do not take place with impunity, nor lightly, neither do
they pass away.

<span id="v.xxvi-p41"></span>\[4.\] ( [Heb.
11.5](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#005)<span id="v.xxvi-p41.1"></span> .md)
“By faith Enoch was translated, that he should not see death, and was
not found, because God had translated him.” This man displayed greater
faith than Abel. How (you ask)? Because, although be came after him, yet
what befell \[Abel\] was sufficient to guide him back.  <span
id="fr_3221"></span>[3222](#fn_3221.md) How? God foreknew that \[Abel\]
would be killed. For He said to Cain: “Thou hast sinned: do not add
thereto.”  <span id="fr_3222"></span>[3223](#fn_3222.md) Honored by him, He
did not protect him. And yet neither did this throw him \[Enoch\] into
indifference. He said not to himself, ‘What need of toils and dangers?
Abel honored God, yet He did not protect him. For what advantage had he
that was departed, from the punishment <span id="page_467">p. 467</span>
<span id="v.xxvi-Page_467"></span> of his brother? And what benefit
could he reap therefrom? Let us allow that he suffers severe punishment:
what is that to him who has been slain?’ He neither said nor thought
anything of this kind, but passing beyond all these things, he knew that
if there is a God, certainly there is a Rewarder also: although as yet
they knew nothing of a resurrection. But if they who as yet know nothing
of a resurrection, and see contradictory things here, thus pleased
\[God\], how much more should we? For they neither knew of a
resurrection, nor had they any examples to look to. This same thing then
made \[Enoch\] well-pleasing \[to God\], namely, that he received
nothing. For he knew that \[God\] “is a rewarder.” Whence \[knew he
this\]? “For He recompensed Abel,” do you say? So that reason suggested
other things, but faith the opposite of what was seen. Even then (he
would say) if you see that you receive nothing here, be not troubled.

<span id="v.xxvi-p44"></span>How was it “by faith” that “Enoch was
translated”? Because his pleasing \[God\] was the cause of his
translation, and faith \[the cause\] of his pleasing \[Him\]. For if he
had not known that he should receive a reward, how could he have pleased
\[Him\]? “But without faith it is impossible to please” Him. How? If a
man believe that there is a God and a retribution, he will have the
reward. Whence then is the well-pleasing?

<span id="v.xxvi-p45"></span> \[5.\] It is necessary to “believe that He
is,” not ‘what He is.’  <span id="fr_3223"></span>[3224](#fn_3223.md) If
“that He is” needs Faith, and not reasonings; it is impossible to
comprehend by reasoning ‘what He is.’ If that “He is a rewarder” needs
Faith and not reasonings, how is it possible by Reasoning to compass His
essence?  <span id="fr_3224"></span>[3225](#fn_3224.md) For what Reasoning
can reach this? For some persons say that the things that exist are
self-caused.  <span id="fr_3225"></span>[3226](#fn_3225.md) Seest thou that
unless we have Faith in regard to all things, not only in regard to
retribution, but also in regard to the very being of God, all is lost to
us?

<span id="v.xxvi-p49"></span>But many ask whither Enoch was translated,
and why he was translated, and why he did not die, neither he nor
Elijah, and, if they are still alive, how they live, and in what form.
But to ask these things is superfluous. For that the one was translated,
and that the other was taken up, the Scriptures have said; but where
they are, and how they are, they have not added: For they say nothing
more than is necessary. For this indeed took place, I mean his
translation, immediately at the beginning, the human soul \[thereby\]
receiving a hope of the destruction of death, and of the overthrow of
the devil’s tyranny, and that death will be done away; for he was
translated, not dead, but “that he should not see death.”

<span id="v.xxvi-p50"></span> Therefore he added, he was translated
alive, because he was well-pleasing \[unto God\]. For just as a Father
when he has threatened his son, wishes indeed immediately after he has
threatened, to relax his threat, but endures and continues resolute,
that for a time he may chasten and correct him, allowing the threat to
remain firm; so also God, to speak as it were after the manner of men,
did not continue resolute, but immediately showed that death is done
away.  And first He allows death to happen, wishing to terrify the
father through the son: For wishing to show that the sentence is verily
fixed, He subjected to this punishment not wicked men at once, but him
even who was well-pleasing, I mean, the blessed Abel; and almost
immediately after him, He translated Enoch. Moreover, He did not raise
the former, lest they should immediately grow bold; but He translated
the other being yet alive: having excited fear by Abel, but by this
latter giving zeal to be well-pleasing unto Him. Wherefore they who say
that all things are ruled and governed of themselves,  <span
id="fr_3226"></span>[3227](#fn_3226.md) and do not expect a reward, are not
well-pleasing; as neither are the heathen. For “He becomes a rewarder of
them that diligently seek Him” by works and by knowledge.

<span id="v.xxvi-p52"></span>\[6.\] Since then we have “a rewarder,” let
us do all things that we may not be deprived of the rewards of virtue.
For indeed the neglecting such a recompense, the scorning such a reward,
is worthy of many tears. For as to “those who diligently seek Him,” He
is a rewarder, so to those who seek Him not, the contrary.

<span id="v.xxvi-p53"></span>“Seek” (He says) “and ye shall find” (
[Matt. vii. 7](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#007.md) <span
id="v.xxvi-p53.1"></span> ): but how can we find the Lord? Consider how
gold is found; with much labor. \[“I sought the Lord\] with my hands”
(it is said) “by night before Him, and I was not deceived” ( [Ps.
lxxvii. 2](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#002.md) <span
id="v.xxvi-p53.2"></span> . See LXX \[[Ps. lxxvi.
3](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#003)<span id="v.xxvi-p53.3"></span>\].md),
that is, just as we seek what is lost, so let us seek God. Do we not
concentrate our mind thereon? Do we not enquire of every one?  Do we not
travel from home? Do we not promise money?

<span id="v.xxvi-p54"></span>For instance, suppose that any among us has
lost his son, what do we not do? What land, what sea do we not make the
circuit of? Do we not reckon money, and houses, and everything else as
secondary to the finding him? And should we find him, we cling to him,
we hold him fast, we do not let him go. And when we are going to seek
anything whatever, we busy ourselves in all ways to find what is sought.
How <span id="page_468">p. 468</span> <span id="v.xxvi-Page_468"></span>
much more ought we to do this in regard to God, as seeking what is
indispensable; nay rather, not in the same way, but much more! But since
we are weak, at least seek God as thou seekest thy money or thy son.
Wilt thou not leave thy home for Him? Hast thou never left thy home for
money? Dost thou not busy thyself in all ways? When thou hast found
\[it\], art thou not full of confidence?

<span id="v.xxvi-p55"></span>\[7.\] “Seek” (He says) “and ye shall
find.” For things sought after need much care, especially in regard of
God. For many are the hindrances, many the things that darken, many that
impede our perception. For as the sun is manifest, and set forth
publicly before all, and we have no need to seek it; but if on the other
hand we bury ourselves and turn everything upside down, we need much
labor to look at the sun; so truly here also, if we bury ourselves in
the depth of evil desires, in the darkness of passions and of the
affairs of this life, with difficulty do we look up, with difficulty do
we raise our heads, with difficulty do we see clearly. He that is buried
underground, in whatever degree he sees upwards, in that degree does he
come towards the sun. Let us therefore shake off the earth, let us break
through the mist which lies upon us. It is thick, and close, and does
not allow us to see clearly.

<span id="v.xxvi-p56"></span>And how, you say, is this cloud broken
through? If we draw to ourselves the beams of “the sun of
righteousness.” “The lifting up of my hands” (it is said) “is an evening
sacrifice.” ( [Ps. cxli. 2](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#002.md) <span
id="v.xxvi-p56.1"></span> .) With our hands let us also lift up our
mind: ye who have been initiated know what I mean,  <span
id="fr_3227"></span>[3228](#fn_3227.md) perhaps too ye recognize the
expression, and see at a glance what I have hinted at. Let us raise up
our thoughts on high.

<span id="v.xxvi-p58"></span> I myself know many men almost suspended
apart from the earth, and beyond measure stretching up their hands, and
out of heart because it is not possible to be lifted into the air, and
thus praying with earnestness. Thus I would have you always, and if not
always, at least very often; and if not very often, at least now and
then, at least in the morning, at least in the evening prayers.  <span
id="fr_3228"></span>[3229](#fn_3228.md) For, tell me, canst thou not
stretch forth the hands? Stretch forth the will, stretch forth as far as
thou wilt, yea even to heaven itself. Even shouldst thou wish to touch
the very summit, even if thou wouldst ascend higher and walk thereon, it
is open to thee. For our mind is lighter, and higher than any winged
creature. And when it receives grace from the Spirit, O! how swift is
it! How quick is it! How does it compass all things! How does it never
sink down or fall to the ground! These wings let us provide for
ourselves: by means of them shall we be able to fly even across the
tempestuous sea of this present life. The swiftest birds fly unhurt over
mountains, and woods, and seas, and rocks, in a brief moment of time.
Such also is the mind; when it is winged, when it is separated from the
things of this life, nothing can lay hold of it, it is higher than all
things, even than the fiery darts of the devil.

<span id="v.xxvi-p60"></span>The devil is not so good a marksman, as to
be able to reach this height; he sends forth his darts indeed, for he is
void of all shame, yet he does not hit the mark; the dart returns to him
without effect, and not without effect only, but it \[falls\] upon his
own head. For what is sent forth by him must of necessity strike
\[something\]. As then, that which has been shot out by men, either
strikes the person against whom it is directed, or pierces bird, or
fence, or garment, or wood, or the mere air, so does the dart of the
devil also. It must of necessity strike; and if it strike not him that
is shot at, it necessarily strikes him that shoots it. And we may learn
from many instances, that when we are not hit, without doubt he is hit
himself.  For instance, he plotted against Job: he did not hit him, but
was struck himself. He plotted against Paul, he did not hit him, but was
struck himself. If we watch, we may see this happening everywhere.  For
even when he strikes, he is hit; much more then \[when he does not
hit\].

<span id="v.xxvi-p61"></span>\[8.\] Let us turn his weapons then against
himself, and having armed and fortified ourselves with the shield of
faith, let us keep guard with steadfastness, so as to be impregnable.
Now the dart of the devil is evil concupiscence. Anger especially is a
fire, a flame; it catches, destroys, consumes; let us quench it, by
longsuffering, by forbearance. For as red-hot iron dipped into water,
loses its fire, so an angry man filling in with a patient one does no
harm to the patient man, but rather benefits him, and is himself more
thoroughly subdued.

<span id="v.xxvi-p62"></span>For nothing is equal to longsuffering. Such
a man is never insulted; but as bodies of adamant are not wounded, so
neither are such souls. For they are above the reach of the darts. The
longsuffering man is high, and so high as not to receive a wound from
the shot. When one is furious, laugh; but do not laugh openly, lest thou
irritate him: but laugh mentally on his account. For in the case of
children, when they strike us passionately, as though forsooth they were
avenging themselves, we laugh. If then thou laugh, there will be as
great difference between thee and him, as between a child and a man: but
if thou art furious thou hast made thyself a child. For the angry are
more senseless than children. If one look at a furious child, does he
not laugh at him? “The poor-spirited” <span id="page_469">p. 469</span>
<span id="v.xxvi-Page_469"></span> (it is said) “is mightily simple.” (
[Prov. xiv. 29](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#029.md) <span
id="v.xxvi-p62.1"></span> .) The simple then is a child: and “he who is
longsuffering” (it is said) “is abundant in wisdom.” This “abundant
wisdom” then let us follow after, that we may attain to the good things
promised us in Christ Jesus our Lord, with whom to the Father together
with the Holy Ghost, be glory, power, honor, now and for ever and world
without end. Amen.
