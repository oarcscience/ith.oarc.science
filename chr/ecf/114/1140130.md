<span id="v.xxxvi-p2"></span> <span id="v.xxxvi-p2.1"></span> <span
class="c1"><span id="v.xxxvi-p2.2"></span>[Hebrews xii.
18-24](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#018)<span
id="v.xxxvi-p2.3"></span></span>

<span id="v.xxxvi-p3"></span> *“For ye are not come unto a fire*  <span
id="fr_3421"></span>[3422](#fn_3421) *that might be touched and that
burned, and unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest, and the sound of
a trumpet, and the voice of words, which voice they that heard entreated
that the word should not be spoken to them any more.*  <span
id="fr_3422"></span>[3423](#fn_3422) *(For they could not endure that
which was commanded, And if so much as a beast touch the mountain, it
shall be stoned.*  <span id="fr_3423"></span>[3424](#fn_3423) *And so
terrible was the sight, that Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake.)
But ye are come unto Mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God,
the Heavenly Jerusalem; and to an innumerable company of Angels, to the
general assembly,*  <span id="fr_3424"></span>[3425](#fn_3424) *and
Church of the first-born which are written in Heaven; and to God the
Judge of all; and to the spirits of just men made perfect: and to Jesus
the Mediator of the New Covenant: and to the blood of sprinkling that
speaketh better things than*  <span id="fr_3425"></span>[3426](#fn_3425)
*that of Abel.”*

<span id="v.xxxvi-p9"></span> \[1.\] <span class="c11"><span
id="v.xxxvi-p9.1"></span>Wonderful</span> indeed were the things in the
Temple, the Holy of Holies; and again awful were those things also that
were done at Mount Sina, “the fire, the darkness, the blackness, the
tempest.” (Cf. [Deut. xxxiii. 2](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#002) <span
id="v.xxxvi-p9.2"></span> .) For, it says, “God appeared in Sina,” and
long ago were these things celebrated.  <span
id="fr_3426"></span>[3427](#fn_3426) The New Covenant, however, was not
given with any of these things, but has been given in simple discourse
by God.  <span id="fr_3427"></span>[3428](#fn_3427)

<span id="v.xxxvi-p12"></span>See then how he makes the comparison in
these points also. And with good reason has he put them afterwards. For
when he had persuaded them by innumerable \[arguments\], when he had
also shown the difference between each covenant, then afterwards, the
one having been already condemned, he easily enters on these points
also.

<span id="v.xxxvi-p13"></span>And what says he? “For ye are not come
unto a fire that might be touched, and that burned, and unto blackness,
and darkness, and tempest, and the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of
words; which they that heard entreated that the word should not be
spoken to them any more.”

<span id="v.xxxvi-p14"></span> These things, he means, are terrible; and
so terrible that they could not even bear to hear them, that not even “a
beast” dared to go up. (But things that come hereafter  <span
id="fr_3428"></span>[3429](#fn_3428) are not such. For what is Sina to
Heaven? And what the “fire which might be touched” to God who cannot be
touched? For “God is a consuming fire.”— [Heb.
5.29](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#029)<span id="v.xxxvi-p15.2"></span>
.) For it is said, “Let not God speak, but let Moses speak unto us. And
so fearful was that which was commanded, Though even a beast touch the
mountain, it shall be stoned; Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake.”
( [Ex. xx. 19](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#019) <span
id="v.xxxvi-p15.3"></span> .) What wonder as respects the people? He
himself who entered into “the darkness where God was,” saith, “I
exceedingly fear and quake.” ( [Ex. xx.
21](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#021) <span id="v.xxxvi-p15.4"></span> .)

<span id="v.xxxvi-p16"></span>\[2.\] “But ye are come unto Mount Sion
and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem: and to an
innumerable company of angels and to the general assembly and Church of
the first-born which are written in Heaven, and to God the Judge of all,
and to the spirits of just men made perfect, and to Jesus the Mediator
of the New Covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh
better \[things\] than that of Abel.”

<span id="v.xxxvi-p17"></span> Instead of “Moses,” <span
class="c11"><span id="v.xxxvi-p17.1"></span>Jesus</span> . Instead of
the people, “myriads of angels.”

<span id="v.xxxvi-p18"></span>Of what “first-born” does he speak? Of the
faithful.

<span id="v.xxxvi-p19"></span>“And to the spirits of just men made
perfect.” With these shall ye be, he says.

<span id="v.xxxvi-p20"></span>“And to Jesus the mediator of the New
Covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better \[things\]
than that of Abel.” Did then the \[blood\] “of Abel” speak? “Yea,” he
saith, “and by it he being dead yet speaketh.” ( [Heb.
11.4](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#004)<span id="v.xxxvi-p20.1"></span>
.) And again God says, “The voice of thy brother’s blood crieth unto
Me.” ( [Gen. iv. 10](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#010) <span
id="v.xxxvi-p20.2"></span> .) Either this \[meaning\] or that; because
it is still even now celebrated: but not in such way as that of Christ.
For this has cleansed all men, and sends forth a voice more clear and
more distinct, in proportion as it has greater testimony, namely that by
facts.

<span id="v.xxxvi-p21"></span> [Heb.
12.25-29](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#025)<span
id="v.xxxvi-p21.1"></span> . “See that ye refuse not Him that speaketh.
For if they escaped not, who refused him that spake  <span
id="fr_3429"></span>[3430](#fn_3429) on earth, much more shall not we
escape, if we turn away from Him that speaketh from heaven. Whose voice
then shook the earth: but now hath He promised, <span id="page_511">p.
511</span> <span id="v.xxxvi-Page_511"></span> saying, Yet once more I
shake not the earth only, but also heaven. And this word, Yet once more,
signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things
that are made, that those which cannot be shaken may remain. Wherefore
we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace whereby
we  <span id="fr_3430"></span>[3431](#fn_3430) serve God acceptably with
reverence and godly fear. For our God is a consuming fire.”

<span id="v.xxxvi-p24"></span> \[3.\] Fearful were those things, but
these are far more admirable and glorious. For here there is not
“darkness,” nor “blackness,” nor “tempest.” It seems to me that by these
words he hints at the obscurity of the Old \[Testament\], and the
overshadowed and veiled  <span id="fr_3431"></span>[3432](#fn_3431)
character of the Law. And besides the Giver of the Law appears in fire
terrible, and apt to punish those who transgress.

<span id="v.xxxvi-p26"></span>But what are “the sounds of the trumpet”?
Probably it is as though some King were coming. This at all events will
also be at the second coming. “At the last trump” ( [1 Cor. xv.
52](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#052) <span id="v.xxxvi-p26.1"></span> )
all must be raised. But it is the trumpet of His voice which effects
this. At that time then all things were objects of sense, and sights,
and sounds; now all are objects of understanding, and invisible.

<span id="v.xxxvi-p27"></span>And, it says, “there was much smoke.” (See
[Ex. xix. 18](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#018) <span
id="v.xxxvi-p27.1"></span> .) For since God is said to be fire, and
appeared thus in the bush, He indicates the fire even by the smoke. And
what is “the blackness and the darkness”? He again expresses its
fearfulness. Thus Isaiah also says; “And the house was filled with
smoke.” ( [Isa. vi. 4](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#004) <span
id="v.xxxvi-p27.2"></span> .) And what is the object of “the tempest”?
The human race was careless. It was therefore needful that they should
be aroused by these things. For no one was so dull as not to have had
his thoughts raised up, when these things were done, and the Law
ordained.  <span id="fr_3432"></span>[3433](#fn_3432)

<span id="v.xxxvi-p29"></span>“Moses spake, and God answered him by a
voice” ( [Ex. xix. 19](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#019) <span
id="v.xxxvi-p29.1"></span> ):  <span
id="fr_3433"></span>[3434](#fn_3433) for it was necessary that the voice
of God should be uttered. Inasmuch as He was about to promulgate His Law
through Moses, therefore He makes him worthy of confidence. They saw him
not, because of the thick darkness: they heard him not, because of the
weakness of his voice. What then? “God answered by a voice,” addressing
the multitude:  <span id="fr_3434"></span>[3435](#fn_3434) yea and his
name shall be called.  <span id="fr_3435"></span>[3436](#fn_3435)

<span id="v.xxxvi-p33"></span> “They entreated” (he says) “that the word
should not be spoken to them any more.”  <span
id="fr_3436"></span>[3437](#fn_3436)

<span id="v.xxxvi-p35"></span> From the first therefore they were
themselves the cause of God’s being manifested through the Flesh.  <span
id="fr_3437"></span>[3438](#fn_3437) Let Moses speak with us, and “Let
not God speak with us.” ( [Ex. xx. 9](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#009)
<span id="v.xxxvi-p36.2"></span> .) They who make comparisons elevate
the one side the more, that they may show the other to be far greater.
In this respect also our \[privileges\]  <span
id="fr_3438"></span>[3439](#fn_3438) are more gentle and more admirable.
For they are great in a twofold respect: because while they are glorious
and greater, they are more accessible. This he says also in the Epistle
to the Corinthians: “with unveiled countenance” ( [2 Cor. iii.
18](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#018) <span id="v.xxxvi-p37.2"></span> ),
and, “not as Moses put a veil over his face.” ( [2 Cor. iii.
13](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#013) <span id="v.xxxvi-p37.3"></span> .)
They, he means, were not counted worthy of what we \[are\]. For of what
were they thought worthy? They saw “darkness, blackness”; they heard “a
voice.” But thou also hast heard a voice, not through darkness, but
through flesh. Thou hast not been disturbed, neither troubled, but thou
hast stood and held discourse with the Mediator.

<span id="v.xxxvi-p38"></span> And in another way, by the “darkness” he
shows the invisibleness.  <span id="fr_3439"></span>[3440](#fn_3439)
“And darkness” (it says) “was under His feet.” ( [Ps. xviii.
9](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#009) <span id="v.xxxvi-p39.2"></span> .)

<span id="v.xxxvi-p40"></span> *Then* even Moses feared, but now no one.

<span id="v.xxxvi-p41"></span> As the people then stood below, so also
do we. They were not below, but below Heaven. The Son is near to God,
but not as Moses.  <span id="fr_3440"></span>[3441](#fn_3440)

<span id="v.xxxvi-p44"></span> *There* was a wilderness, here a city.

<span id="v.xxxvi-p45"></span>\[4.\] “And to an innumerable company of
angels.” Here he shows the joy, the delight, in place of the “blackness”
and “darkness” and “tempest.”

<span id="v.xxxvi-p46"></span>“And to the general assembly and church of
the first-born which are written in Heaven, and to God the Judge of
all.” They did not draw near, but stood afar off, even Moses: but “ye
are come near.”

<span id="v.xxxvi-p47"></span>Here he makes them fear, by saying, “And
to God the Judge of all”; not of the Jews alone, and the faithful, but
even of the whole world.

<span id="v.xxxvi-p48"></span>“And to the spirits of just men made
perfect.” He means the souls of those who are approved.

<span id="v.xxxvi-p49"></span> “And to <span class="c11"><span
id="v.xxxvi-p49.1"></span>Jesus</span> the Mediator of the New Covenant:
and to the blood of sprinkling,” that is, of purification, “which
speaketh better things <span id="page_512">p. 512</span> <span
id="v.xxxvi-Page_512"></span> than that of Abel.” And if the blood
speaks, much more does He who, having been slain, lives. But what does
it speak? “The Spirit also” (he says) “speaketh with groanings which
cannot be uttered.” ( [Rom. viii. 26](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#026)
<span id="v.xxxvi-p49.2"></span> .) How does He speak?  Whenever He
falls into a sincere mind, He raises it up and makes it speak.

<span id="v.xxxvi-p50"></span> \[5.\] “See that ye refuse not Him that
speaketh”; that is, that ye reject  <span
id="fr_3441"></span>[3442](#fn_3441) \[Him\] not. “For if they escaped
not who refused Him that spake  <span
id="fr_3442"></span>[3443](#fn_3442) on earth.” Whom does he mean?
Moses, I suppose. But what he says is this: if they, having “refused
Him” when He gave laws “on earth, did not escape,” how shall we refuse
Him, when He gives laws from Heaven? He declares here not that He is
another; far from it. He does not set forth One and Another, but He
appears terrible, when uttering His Voice “from Heaven.”  <span
id="fr_3443"></span>[3444](#fn_3443) It is He Himself then, both the one
and the other: but the One is terrible. For he expresses not a
difference of Persons but of the gift. Whence does this appear? “For if
they escaped not,” he says, “who refused Him that spake on earth, much
more shall not we escape, if we turn away from Him that speaketh from
heaven.” What then? Is this one different from the other? How then does
he say, “whose voice then shook the earth”? For it was the “voice” of
Him who “then” gave the Law, which “shook the earth. But now hath He
promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also
heaven. And this word Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those
things which are shaken, as of things that are made.” All things
therefore will be taken away, and will be compacted anew for the better.
For this is what he suggests here. Why then dost thou grieve when thou
sufferest in a world that abideth not; when thou art afflicted in a
world which will very shortly have passed away? If our rest were \[to
be\] in the latter period of the world, then one ought to be afflicted
in looking to the end.

<span id="v.xxxvi-p54"></span>“That” (he says) “those which cannot be
shaken may remain.” But of what sort are “those things which cannot be
shaken”? The things to come.

<span id="v.xxxvi-p55"></span>\[6.\] Let us then do all for this, that
we may attain that \[rest\], that we may enjoy those good things. Yea, I
pray and beseech you, let us be earnest for this. No one builds in a
city which is going to fall down. Tell me, I pray you, if any one said
that after a year, this city would fall, but such a city not at all,
wouldest thou have built in that which was about to fall? So I also now
say this, Let us not build in this world; it will fall after a little,
and all will be destroyed. But why do I say, It will fall? Before its
fall we shall be destroyed, and suffer what is fearful; we shall be
removed from them.

<span id="v.xxxvi-p56"></span>Why build we upon the sand? Let us build
upon the rock: for whatsoever may happen, that building remains
impregnable, nothing will be able to destroy it. With good reason. For
to all such attacks that region is inaccessible, just as this is
accessible. For earthquakes, and fires, and inroad of enemies, take it
away from us even while we are alive: and oftentimes destroy us with it.

<span id="v.xxxvi-p57"></span>And even in case it remains, disease
speedily removes us, or if we stay, suffers us not to enjoy it fairly.
For what pleasure \[is there\], where there are sicknesses, and false
accusations, and envy, and intrigues? Or should there be none of these
things, yet oftentimes if we have no children, we are disquieted, we are
impatient, not having any to whom we may leave houses and all other
things; and thenceforward we pine away as laboring for others. Yea
oftentimes too the inheritance passes away to our enemies, not only
after we are gone, but even while we live. What is more miserable then
than to toil for enemies, and ourselves to be gathering sins together in
order that they may have rest? And many are the instances of this that
are seen in our cities. And yet \[I say no more\] lest I should grieve
those who have been despoiled. For I could have mentioned some of them
even by name, and have had many histories to tell, and many houses to
show you, which have received for masters the enemies of those who
labored for them: nay not houses only, but slaves also and the whole
inheritance have oftentimes come round to enemies. For such are things
human.

<span id="v.xxxvi-p58"></span>But in Heaven there is nothing of this to
fear,—lest after a man is dead, his enemy should come, and succeed to
his inheritance. For there there is neither death nor enmity; the
tabernacles of the saints are permanent abodes; and among those saints
is exultation, joy, gladness. For “the voice of rejoicing” (it is said)
is “in the tabernacles of the righteous.” ( [Ps. cxviii.
15](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#015) <span id="v.xxxvi-p58.1"></span> .)
They are eternal, having no end. They do not fall down through age, they
do not change their owners, but stand continually in their best estate.
With good reason. For there is nothing corruptible, nor perishable
there, but all is immortal, and undefiled. On this building let us
exhaust all our wealth. We have no need of carpenters nor of laborers.
The hands of the poor build such houses; the lame, the blind, the <span
id="page_513">p. 513</span> <span id="v.xxxvi-Page_513"></span> maimed,
they build those houses. And wonder not, since they procure even a
kingdom for us, and give us confidence towards God.

<span id="v.xxxvi-p59"></span> \[7.\] For mercifulness  <span
id="fr_3444"></span>[3445](#fn_3444) is as it were a most excellent art,
and a protector of those who labor at it. For it is dear to God, and
ever stands near Him readily asking favor for whomsoever it will, if
only it be not wronged by us; And it is wronged, when we do it by
extortion. (See p. 481.) So, if it be pure, it gives great confidence to
those who offer it up. It intercedes even for those who have offended,
so great is its power, even for those who have sinned. It breaks the
chains, disperses the darkness, quenches the fire, kills the worm,
drives away the gnashing of teeth. The gates of heaven open to it with
great security: And as when a Queen is entering, no one of the guards
stationed at the doors dares to inquire who she is, and whence, but all
straightway receive her; so also indeed with mercifulness. For she is
truly a queen indeed, making men like God. For, he says, “ye shall be
merciful, as your Heavenly Father is merciful.” ( [Luke vi.
36](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#036) <span id="v.xxxvi-p60.6"></span> .)

<span id="v.xxxvi-p61"></span>She is winged and buoyant, having golden
pinions, with a flight which greatly delights the angels. There, it is
said, are “the wings of a dove covered with silver, and her back with
the yellowness of gold.” ( [Ps. lxviii.
13](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#013) <span id="v.xxxvi-p61.1"></span> .)
As some dove golden and living, she flies, with gentle look, and mild
eye. Nothing is better than that eye. The peacock is beautiful, but in
comparison of her, is a jackdaw. So beautiful and worthy of admiration
is this bird. She continually looks upwards; she is surrounded
abundantly with God’s glory: she is a virgin with golden wings, decked
out, with a fair and mild countenance. She is winged, and buoyant,
standing by the royal throne. When we are judged, she suddenly flies in,
and shows herself, and rescues us from punishment, sheltering us with
her own wings.

<span id="v.xxxvi-p62"></span>God would have her rather than sacrifices.
Much does He discourse concerning her: so He loves her. “He will
relieve” (it is said) “the widow” and “the fatherless” ( [Ps. cxlvi.
9](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#009) <span id="v.xxxvi-p62.1"></span> )
and the poor. God wishes to be called from her. “The Lord is pitiful and
merciful,  <span id="fr_3445"></span>[3446](#fn_3445) long-suffering,
and of great mercy” ( [Ps. cxlv. 8](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#008)
<span id="v.xxxvi-p63.8"></span> ), and true. The mercy of God is over
all the earth. She hath saved the race of mankind (see [Ps. cxlv.
9](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#009) <span id="v.xxxvi-p63.9"></span> ):
For unless she had pitied us, all things would have perished. “When we
were enemies” (see [Rom. v. 10](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#010) <span
id="v.xxxvi-p63.10"></span> ), she “reconciled” us, she wrought
innumerable blessings; she persuaded the Son of God to become a slave,
and to empty Himself \[of His glory\].  <span
id="fr_3446"></span>[3447](#fn_3446) ( [Phil. ii.
7](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007) <span id="v.xxxvi-p64.2"></span> .)

<span id="v.xxxvi-p65"></span>Let us earnestly emulate her by whom we
have been saved; let us love her, let us prize her before wealth, and
apart from wealth, let us have a merciful soul. Nothing is so
characteristic of a Christian, as mercy. There is nothing which both
unbelievers and all men so admire, as when we are merciful. For
oftentimes we are ourselves also in need of this mercy, and say to God
“Have mercy upon us, after Thy great goodness.” ( [Ps. li.
1](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#001) <span id="v.xxxvi-p65.1"></span> .) 
Let us begin first ourselves: or rather it is not we that begin first.
For He has Himself already shown His mercy towards us: yet at least let
us follow second. For if men have mercy on a merciful man, even if he
has done innumerable wrongs, much more does God.

<span id="v.xxxvi-p66"></span>\[8.\] Hear the prophet saying, “But I”
(his words are) “am like a fruitful olive tree in the house of God.” (
[Ps. lii. 8](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#008) <span
id="v.xxxvi-p66.1"></span> .) Let us become such: let us become “as an
olive tree”: let us be laden on every side with the commandments. For it
is not enough to be as an olive tree, but also to be fruitful. For there
are persons who in doing alms give little, \[only once\] in the course
of the whole year, or in each week, or who give away a mere chance
matter. These are indeed olive trees, but not fruitful ones, but even
withered. For because they show compassion they are olive trees, but
because they do it not liberally, they are not fruitful olive trees. But
let us be fruitful.

<span id="v.xxxvi-p67"></span> I have often said and I say now also: the
greatness of the charity  <span id="fr_3447"></span>[3448](#fn_3447) is
not shown by the measure of what is given, but by the disposition of the
giver. You know the case of the widow. It is well continually to bring
this example \[forward\], that not even the poor man may despair of
himself, when he looks on her who threw in the two mites. Some
contributed even hair in the fitting up of the temple, and not even
these were rejected. ( [Ex. xxxv. 23](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#023)
<span id="v.xxxvi-p68.3"></span> .) But if when they had gold, they had
brought hair, they \[would have been\] accursed: but if, having this
only, they brought it, they were accepted. For this cause Cain also was
blamed, not because he offered worthless things, but because they were
the most worthless he had. “Accursed” (it is said) “is he which hath a
male, and sacrificeth unto God a corrupt thing.” ( [Mal. i.
14](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#014) <span id="v.xxxvi-p68.4"></span> .)
He did not speak absolutely, but, “he that hath” (he says) and spareth
\[it\]. If then a man have nothing, he is freed from blame, or rather he
has a reward. For what is of less value than two farthings, or more
worthless than hair? What than a pint of meal? But nevertheless these
were approved equally with the calves and the gold. For “a man is
accepted according to that he hath, not according to that he hath not.”
<span id="page_514">p. 514</span> <span id="v.xxxvi-Page_514"></span> (
[2 Cor. viii. 12](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#012) <span
id="v.xxxvi-p68.5"></span> .)  And, it says, “according as thy hand
hath, do good.” ( [Prov. iii. 27](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#027) <span
id="v.xxxvi-p68.6"></span> .)

<span id="v.xxxvi-p69"></span>Wherefore, I entreat you, let us readily
empty out what we have for the poor. Even if it be little we shall
receive the same reward with them who have cast the most; or rather,
more than those who cast in ten thousand talents. If we do these things
we shall obtain the unspeakable treasures of God; if we not only hear,
but practice also, if we do not praise \[charity\], but also show \[it\]
by our deeds. Which may we all attain, in Christ Jesus our Lord, with
whom to the Father together with the Holy Ghost, be glory, might, honor,
now and for ever and world without end. Amen.

id="v.xxxvi-p41.1"></span>

<span id="v.xxxvi-p42"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.xxxvi-p42.1"></span>This passage, Mr. Field observes, is difficult
and probably corrupt. St. Chrysostom seems to mean, that we are like the
people in that we are still here below, not in heaven: for they
were</span> “ <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.xxxvi-p42.2"></span>below</span> ” <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.xxxvi-p42.3"></span>only in the sense of being below in reference
to the mountain and heaven to which Moses had been called up. At the
same time as being sons of God we are near to Him with a special
nearness—a spiritual and so most intimate nearness—of the soul, not like
that bodily nearness with which Moses was called to draw near.</span>

<span id="v.xxxvi-p43"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.xxxvi-p43.1"></span>If, however,</span> “ <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.xxxvi-p43.2"></span>the Son</span> ” <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.xxxvi-p43.3"></span>be understood of the
Only-Begotten, it may be supposed that there is some latent connection
of thought, as, that in His nearness His people also are brought near to
the Father in a manner far more intimate than was granted to
Moses.</span>

above, Hom. xxiii. \[1\], p. 469. St. Chrysostom’s argument seems to
oblige us to understand in the next clause something equivalent
to</span> “ <span class="Greek"><span id="v.xxxvi-p52.3"></span>you
say,</span> ” <span class="Greek"><span id="v.xxxvi-p52.4"></span>which
words have been inserted for clearness’ sake. The supposition that Moses
was meant by</span> <span class="Greek"><span

class="Greek"><span id="v.xxxvi-p52.6"></span>is mentioned only to be
