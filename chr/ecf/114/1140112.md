<span id="v.xviii-p1"></span> <span class="c15"><span
id="v.xviii-p1.1"></span>Homily XIV.</span>

<span id="v.xviii-p2"></span> <span id="v.xviii-p2.1"></span> <span
class="c1"><span id="v.xviii-p2.2"></span>[Heb.
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#001.md),
[2](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#002.md)<span
id="v.xviii-p2.3"></span></span>

<span id="v.xviii-p3"></span>“Now of the things which we have spoken
this is the sum: We have such an High Priest; who is set down on the
right hand of the throne of the majesty in the heavens: a minister of
the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle which the Lord pitched, and not
man.”

<span id="v.xviii-p4"></span> \[1.\] <span class="c11"><span
id="v.xviii-p4.1"></span>Paul</span> mixes the lowly things with the
lofty, ever imitating his Master, so that the lowly become the path to
the lofty, and through the former we are led to the latter, and when we
are amid the great things we learn that these \[lowly ones\] were a
condescension. This accordingly he does here also. After declaring that
“He offered up Himself,” and showing Him to be a “High Priest,” what
does he say? “Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: we
have such an High Priest who is set down on the right hand of the throne
of the majesty.” And yet this is not \[the office\] of a Priest, but of
Him whom the Priest should serve.

<span id="v.xviii-p5"></span> “A minister of the sanctuary,” not simply
a minister, but “a minister of the sanctuary. And of the true
Tabernacle, which the Lord pitched and not man.” Thou seest the
condescension. Did he not a little before make a separation,  <span
id="fr_2989"></span>[2990](#fn_2989.md) saying: “Are they not all
ministering spirits?” ( [Heb.
1.14](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#014)<span id="v.xviii-p6.2"></span> .md)
and therefore (he says) it is not said to them, “Sit thou on my right
hand,” ( [Heb. 1.13](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#013.md)<span
id="v.xviii-p6.3"></span> ) for He that sitteth is not a minister. How
is it then that it is here said, “a minister,” and “a minister of the
Sanctuary”? for he means here the Tabernacle.

<span id="v.xviii-p7"></span> See how he raised up the minds of the
believing Jews. For as they would be apt to imagine that we have no such
tabernacle \[as they had\], see here (he says) is the Priest, Great,
yea, much greater than the other, and who has offered a more wonderful
sacrifice. But is not all this mere talk? is it not a boast, and merely
said to win over our minds? on this account he established it first from
the oath, and afterwards also from “the tabernacle.” For this difference
too was manifest: but the Apostle thinks of another also, “which” (he
says) “the Lord pitched \[or “made firm”\] and not man.” Where are they
who say that the heaven whirls around?  <span
id="fr_2990"></span>[2991](#fn_2990.md) where are they who declare that it
is spherical? for both of these notions are overthrown here.

<span id="v.xviii-p9"></span>“Now” (he says) “of the things which we
have spoken this is the sum.” By “the sum” is always meant what is most
important. Again he brings down his discourse; having said what is
lofty, henceforward he speaks fearlessly.

<span id="v.xviii-p10"></span>\[2.\] In the next place that thou mayest
understand that he used the word “minister” of the manhood, observe how
he again indicates it: “For” ( [Heb.
8.3](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#003)<span id="v.xviii-p10.1"></span> .md)
(he says) “every high priest is ordained to offer both gifts and
sacrifices, wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat
also to offer.”

<span id="v.xviii-p11"></span> Do not now, because thou hearest that He
sitteth, suppose that His being called High Priest is mere idle talk.
 <span id="fr_2991"></span>[2992](#fn_2991.md) For the former, viz. His
sitting, belongs to the dignity of the Godhead,  <span
id="fr_2992"></span>[2993](#fn_2992.md) but this to His great
lovingkindness, and His tender care for us. On this account he
repeatedly urges  <span id="fr_2993"></span>[2994](#fn_2993.md) this very
thing, and dwells more upon it: for he feared lest the other \[truth\]
should overthrow it.  <span id="fr_2994"></span>[2995](#fn_2994.md)
Therefore he again brings down his discourse to this: since some were
enquiring why He died. He was a Priest. But there is no Priest without a
sacrifice. It is necessary then that He also should have a sacrifice.

<span id="v.xviii-p16"></span>And in another way; Having said that He is
on high, he affirms and proves that He is a Priest from every
consideration, from Melchisedec, from the oath, from offering sacrifice.
From this he also frames another and necessary syllogism. “For if” (he
says) “He had been on earth, He would not be a Priest, seeing that there
are priests who offer the gifts according to the Law.” If then He is a
Priest (as He really is), we must seek some other place for Him.  “For
if He were” indeed “on earth, He should not be a priest.” For how
\[could He be\]? He offered no sacrifice, He ministered not in the
Priest’s office. And with good reason, for there were the priests.
Moreover he shows, that it was impossible that \[He\] should be a priest
upon earth. For how \[could He be\]? There was no rising up against
\[the appointed Priests\], he means.

<span id="v.xviii-p17"></span>\[3.\] Here we must apply our minds
attentively, and consider the Apostolic wisdom; for again he shows the
difference of the Priesthood. <span id="page_434">p. 434</span> <span
id="v.xviii-Page_434"></span> “Who” (he says) “serve unto the example
 <span id="fr_2995"></span>[2996](#fn_2995.md) and shadow of heavenly
things.”

<span id="v.xviii-p19"></span> What are the heavenly things he speaks of
here? The spiritual things. For although they are done on earth, yet
nevertheless they are worthy of the Heavens. For when our Lord Jesus
Christ lies slain  <span id="fr_2996"></span>[2997](#fn_2996.md) \[as a
sacrifice\], when the Spirit is with us,  <span
id="fr_2997"></span>[2998](#fn_2997.md) when He who sitteth on the right
hand of the Father is here,  <span id="fr_2998"></span>[2999](#fn_2998.md)
when sons are made by the Washing, when they are fellow-citizens of
those in Heaven, when we have a country, and a city, and citizenship
there, when we are strangers to things here, how can all these be other
than “heavenly things”? But what! Are not our Hymns heavenly? Do not we
also who are below utter in concert with them the same things which the
divine choirs of bodiless powers sing above? Is not the altar also
heavenly? How? It hath nothing carnal, all spiritual things become the
offerings.  <span id="fr_2999"></span>[3000](#fn_2999.md) The sacrifice
does not disperse into ashes, or into smoke, or into steamy savor, it
makes the things placed there bright and splendid. How again can the
rites which we celebrate be other than heavenly? For when He says,
“Whose soever sins ye retain they are retained, whose soever sins ye
remit, they are remitted” ( [John xx.
23](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#023) <span id="v.xviii-p23.13"></span> .md)
when they have the keys of heaven, how can all be other than heavenly?

<span id="v.xviii-p24"></span> “Who” (he says) “serve unto the example
and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God,  <span
id="fr_3000"></span>[3001](#fn_3000.md) when he was about to make the
tabernacle, for see, saith He, that thou make all things according to
the pattern showed to thee in the mount.” Inasmuch as our hearing is
less ready of apprehension than our sight (for the things which we hear
we do not in such wise lay up in our soul, as those which we see with
our very eyes), He showed him all. Either then he means this by “the
example and shadow,” or else he \[speaks\] of the Temple. For, he went
on to say, “See” (His words are), that “thou make all things according
to the pattern  <span id="fr_3001"></span>[3002](#fn_3001.md) showed to
thee in the mount.” Was it then only what concerned the furniture of the
temple that he saw, or was it also what related to the sacrifices, and
all the rest? Nay, one would not be wrong in saying even this; for The
Church is heavenly, and is nothing else than Heaven.

<span id="v.xviii-p27"></span>\[4.\] ( [Heb.
8.6](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#006)<span id="v.xviii-p27.1"></span> .md)
“But now hath He obtained a more excellent ministry,  <span
id="fr_3002"></span>[3003](#fn_3002.md) by how much also He is the Mediator
of a better covenant.” Thou seest (he means) how much better is the one
ministration than the other, if one be an example and type, and the
other truth \[reality\]. But this did not profit the hearers, nor cheer
them. Therefore he says what especially cheered them: “Which was
established upon better promises.” Having raised them up by speaking of
the place, and the priest, and the sacrifice, he then sets forth also
the wide difference of the covenant, having also said before that it was
“weak and unprofitable.” (See [Heb. vii.
18](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#018) <span id="v.xviii-p28.4"></span> ..md)

<span id="v.xviii-p29"></span>And observe what safeguards he lays down,
when intending to find fault with it. For in the former place after
saying, “according to the power of an endless life” ( [Heb. vii.
16](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#016) <span id="v.xviii-p29.1"></span> .md),
he then said that “there is a disannulling of the commandment going
before” ( [Heb. vii. 18](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#018.md) <span
id="v.xviii-p29.2"></span> ); and then after that, he set forth
something great, saying, “by which we draw nigh unto God.” ( [Heb. vii.
19](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#019) <span id="v.xviii-p29.3"></span> ..md)
And in this place, after leading us up into Heaven, and showing that
instead of the temple, we have Heaven, and that those things were types
of ours, and having by these means exalted the Ministration \[of the New
Covenant\], he then proceeds suitably to exalt the priesthood.

<span id="v.xviii-p30"></span>But (as I said) he sets down that which
especially cheers them, in the words, “Which was established upon better
promises.” Whence does appear? In that this the one was cast out, and
the other introduced in its place: for it is therefore of force because
it is better. For as he says, “If perfection were by” it, “what further
need was there, that another priest should rise, after the order of
Melchisedec?” ( [Heb. vii. 11](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#011.md) <span
id="v.xviii-p30.1"></span> ); so also here he used the same syllogism,
saying ( [Heb. 8.7](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#007.md)<span
id="v.xviii-p30.2"></span> ) “For if that first covenant had been
faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second”; that
is, if it made men “faultless.” For it is because he is speaking of this
that he did not say, “But finding fault with” it, but ( [Heb.
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#008.md),
[9](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#009)<span id="v.xviii-p30.3"></span> .md)
“But finding fault with them, He saith, Behold, the days come, saith the
Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with
the house of Judah: not according to the covenant that I made with their
fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the
land of Egypt: because they continued not in My covenant, and I regarded
them not, saith the Lord.”

<span id="v.xviii-p31"></span>Yea, verily. And whence does it appear
that \[the first Covenant\] came to an end? He showed it indeed also
from the Priest, but now he shows more clearly by express words that it
has been cast out.

<span id="v.xviii-p32"></span>But how is it “upon better promises”? For
<span id="page_435">p. 435</span> <span id="v.xviii-Page_435"></span>
how, tell me, can earth and heaven be equal? But do thou consider,
 <span id="fr_3003"></span>[3004](#fn_3003.md) how he speaks of promises
there \[in that other covenant\] also, that thou mayest not bring this
charge against it. For there also, he says “a better hope, by which we
draw nigh unto God” ( [Heb. vii. 19](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#019.md)
<span id="v.xviii-p33.3"></span> ), showing that a Hope was *there*
also; and in this place “better promises,” hinting that *there* also He
had made promises.

<span id="v.xviii-p34"></span>But inasmuch as they were forever making
objections, he says, “Behold! the days come, saith the Lord, when I will
make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of
Judah.” He is not speaking of any old Covenant: for, that they might not
assert this, he determined the time also. Thus he did not say simply,
“according to the covenant which I made with their fathers,” lest thou
shouldest say \[it was\] the one made with Abraham, or that with Noah:
but he declares what \[covenant it was\], “not according to the covenant
which I made with their fathers” in the Exodus. Wherefore he added also,
“in the day that I took them by the hand, to lead them out of the land
of Egypt; because they continued not in My covenant, and I regarded them
not, saith the Lord.” Thou seest that the evils begin first from
ourselves (“they” themselves first, saith he, “continued not in \[the
“covenant”\]”) and the negligence is from ourselves, but the good things
from Him; I mean the \[acts\] of bounty. He here introduces, as it were,
an apology showing the cause why He forsakes them.

<span id="v.xviii-p35"></span>\[5.\] ( [Heb.
8.10](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#010)<span id="v.xviii-p35.1"></span> .md)
“For this,” he says, “is the covenant that I will make with the house of
Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put  <span
id="fr_3004"></span>[3005](#fn_3004.md) My laws into their mind, and write
them in their hearts, and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to
Me a people.” Thus He says this concerning the New \[covenant\] because
His words are “not according to the covenant which I covenanted.”

<span id="v.xviii-p37"></span> But what other difference is there beside
this?  <span id="fr_3005"></span>[3006](#fn_3005.md) Now if any person
should say that “the difference is not in this respect, but in respect
to its being put into their hearts; He makes no mention of any
difference of ordinances, but points out the mode of its being given:
for no longer” (he says) “shall the covenant be in writings, but in
hearts;” let the Jew in that case show that this was ever carried into
effect; but he could not, for it was made a second time in writings
after the return from Babylon. But I show that the Apostles received
nothing in writing, but received \[it\] in their hearts through the Holy
Ghost. Wherefore also Christ said, “When He cometh, He will bring all
things to your remembrance, and He shall teach you.” ( [John xiv.
26](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#026) <span id="v.xviii-p38.2"></span> ..md)

<span id="v.xviii-p39"></span>\[6.\] ( [Heb.
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#011.md),
[12](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#012)<span id="v.xviii-p39.1"></span> .md)
“And they shall not teach” (he says) “every man his neighbor,  <span
id="fr_3006"></span>[3007](#fn_3006.md) and every man his brother, saying,
Know the Lord: for all shall know Me from the least to the greatest. For
I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their
iniquities will I remember no more.” Behold also another sign. “From the
least even to the greatest of them” (he says) “they shall know Me, and
they shall not say, Know the Lord.” When hath this been fulfilled save
now? For our \[religion\]  <span id="fr_3007"></span>[3008](#fn_3007.md) is
manifest: but theirs \[i.e. the Jews’\] was not manifest, but had been
shut up in a corner.

<span id="v.xviii-p42"></span> \[A covenant\] is then said to be “new,”
when it is different and shows some advantage over the old. “Nay
surely,” says one,  <span id="fr_3008"></span>[3009](#fn_3008.md) “it is
new also when part of it has been taken away, and part not. For
instance, when an old house is ready to fall down, if a person leaving
the whole, has patched up the foundation, straightway we say, he has
made it new, when he has taken some parts away, and brought others into
their place. For even the heaven also is thus called ‘new,’  <span
id="fr_3009"></span>[3010](#fn_3009.md) when it is no longer ‘of brass,’
but gives rain;  <span id="fr_3010"></span>[3011](#fn_3010.md) and the
earth likewise is new when it is not un <span id="page_436">p.
436</span> <span id="v.xviii-Page_436"></span> fruitful, not when it has
been changed; and the house is likewise new, when portions of it have
been taken away, and portions remain. And thus, he says,  <span
id="fr_3011"></span>[3012](#fn_3011.md) he hath well termed it ‘a New
Covenant.’”

<span id="v.xviii-p49"></span> If then I show that that covenant had
become “Old” in this respect, that it yielded no fruit? And that thou
mayest know this exactly, read what Haggai says, what Zechariah, what
the Messenger,  <span id="fr_3012"></span>[3013](#fn_3012.md) when the
return from the Captivity had not yet fully taken place; and what Esdras
charges. How then did \[the people\] receive him?  <span
id="fr_3013"></span>[3014](#fn_3013.md) And how no man enquired of the
Lord, inasmuch as they \[the priests\] themselves also transgressed, and
knew it not even themselves?  <span id="fr_3014"></span>[3015](#fn_3014.md)
Dost thou see how thy \[interpretation\] is broken down,  <span
id="fr_3015"></span>[3016](#fn_3015.md) whilst I maintain my own: that this
\[covenant\] must be called “New” in the proper sense of the word?

<span id="v.xviii-p54"></span>And besides, I do not concede that the
words “the heaven shall be new” ( [Isa. lxv.
17](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#017) <span id="v.xviii-p54.1"></span> .md),
were spoken concerning this. For why, when saying in Deuteronomy “the
heaven shall be of brass,” did he not set down this in the contrasted
passage,  <span id="fr_3016"></span>[3017](#fn_3016.md) “but if ye hearken,
it shall be new.”

<span id="v.xviii-p56"></span>And further on this account He says that
He will give “another Covenant, because they did not continue in the
first.” This I show by what he says (“For what the law could not do in
that it was weak through the flesh,” [Rom. viii.
3](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#003.md) <span id="v.xviii-p56.1"></span> ;
and again, “Why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the
disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?” [Acts
xv. 10](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#010.md) <span
id="v.xviii-p56.2"></span> .) But “they did not continue therein,” he
says.

<span id="v.xviii-p57"></span>Here he shows that \[God\] counts us
worthy of greater and of spiritual \[privileges\]: for it is said “their
sound went out into all the earth and their words unto the ends of the
world.” ( [Ps. 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#005.md), [Rom.
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#018.md)<span id="v.xviii-p57.1"></span>
.) That is \[the meaning of\] “they shall not say each man to his
neighbor, Know the Lord.” And again, “the earth shall be filled with the
knowledge of the Lord as much water to cover the seas.” ( [Isa. xi.
9](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#009) <span id="v.xviii-p57.2"></span> ..md)

<span id="v.xviii-p58"></span>\[7.\] “In calling it new” (he says), “He
hath made the first old: but that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready
to vanish away.” See what was hidden, how he hath laid open the very
mind of the prophet! He honored the law, and was not willing to call it
“old” in express terms: but nevertheless, this he did call it. For if
the former had been new, he would not have called this which came
afterwards “new” also. So that by granting something more and different,
he declares that “it was waxen old.” Therefore it is done away and is
perishing, and no longer exists.

<span id="v.xviii-p59"></span> Having taken boldness from the prophet,
he attacks it more suitably,  <span id="fr_3017"></span>[3018](#fn_3017.md)
showing that our \[dispensation\] is now flourishing. That is, he showed
that \[the other\] was old: then taking up the word “old,” and adding of
himself another \[circumstance\], the \[characteristic\] of old age, he
took up what was omitted by the others, and says “ready to vanish away.”

<span id="v.xviii-p61"></span>The New then has not simply caused the old
to cease, but because it had become aged, as it was not \[any longer\]
useful. On this account he said, “for the weakness and unprofitableness
thereof” ( [Heb. vii. 18](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#018.md) <span
id="v.xviii-p61.1"></span> ), and, “the law made nothing perfect” (
[Heb. vii. 19](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#019.md) <span
id="v.xviii-p61.2"></span> ); and that “if the first had been faultless,
then should no place have been sought for the second.” ( [Heb. viii.
7](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#007) <span id="v.xviii-p61.3"></span> ..md)
And “faultless”; that is, useful; not as though it \[the old Covenant\]
was obnoxious to any charges, but as not being sufficient. He used a
familiar form of speech. As if one should say, the house is not
faultless, that is, it has some defect, it is decayed: the garment is
not faultless, that is, it is coming to pieces. He does not therefore
here speak of it as evil, but only as having some fault and deficiency.

<span id="v.xviii-p62"></span> \[8.\] So then we also are new, or rather
we were made new, but now are become old; therefore we are “near to
vanishing away,” and to destruction. Let us scrape off  <span
id="fr_3018"></span>[3019](#fn_3018.md) this old age. It is indeed no
longer possible to do it by Washing, but by repentance it is possible
here \[in this life\].  <span id="fr_3019"></span>[3020](#fn_3019.md) If
there be in us anything old, let us cast it off; if any “wrinkle,” if
any stain, if any “spot,” let us wash it away and become fair ( [Eph. v.
27](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#027) <span id="v.xviii-p64.3"></span> .md):
that “the King may desire our beauty.” ( [Ps. xlv.
11](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#011) <span id="v.xviii-p64.4"></span> ..md)

<span id="v.xviii-p65"></span> It is possible even for him who has
fallen into the extremest deformity  <span
id="fr_3020"></span>[3021](#fn_3020.md) to recover that beauty of which
David says that the King shall desire <span id="page_437">p. 437</span>
<span id="v.xviii-Page_437"></span> thy beauty. “Hearken, O daughter,
and consider; forget also thine own people and thy father’s house: so
shall the King greatly desire thy beauty.” ( [Ps.
45:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#010.md),
[11](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#011)<span id="v.xviii-p87.4"></span> ..md)
And yet forgetting doth not produce beauty. Yea, beauty is of the soul.
What sort of forgetting? That of sins. For he is speaking about the
Church from among the Gentiles, exhorting her not to remember the things
of her fathers, that is \[of\] those that sacrificed to idols; for from
such was it gathered.

<span id="v.xviii-p88"></span>And he said not, “Go not after them,” but
what is more, Do not admit them into thy mind; which he says also in
another place, “I will not mention their names through my lips.” ( [Ps.
xvi. 4](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#004.md) <span
id="v.xviii-p88.1"></span> .) And again, “That my mouth may not talk of
the deeds of men.” ( [Ps. 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#003.md),
[4](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#004)<span id="v.xviii-p88.2"></span> ..md)
As yet is this no great virtue; nay, rather, it is indeed great, but not
such as this \[which is here spoken of\]. For what does he say there? He
says not; “Talk not of the things of men, neither speak of the things of
thy fathers”; but, neither remember them, nor admit them into thy mind.
Thou seest to how great a distance he would have us keep away from
wickedness. For he that remembers not \[a matter\] will not think of it,
and he that does not think, will not speak of it: and he that does not
speak of it, will not do it. Seest thou from how many paths he hath
walled us off? by what great intervals he hath removed us, even to a
very great \[distance\]?

<span id="v.xviii-p89"></span>\[9.\] Let us then also “hearken and
forget” our own evils. I do not say our sins, for (He says) “Remember
thou first, and I will not remember.” ( [Isa.
43:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#026.md),
[25](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#025.md)<span id="v.xviii-p89.1"></span> ,
LXX.) I mean for instance, Let us no longer remember rapacity, but even
restore the former \[plunder\]. This is to forget wickedness, and to
cast out the thought of rapacity, and never at any time to admit it, but
to wipe away also the things already done amiss.

<span id="v.xviii-p90"></span>Whence may the forgetfulness of wickedness
come to us? From the remembrance of good things, from the remembrance of
God. If we continually remember God, we cannot remember those things
also. For (he says) “When I remembered Thee upon my bed, I thought upon
Thee in the morning dawn.” ( [Ps. lxiii.
6](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#006) <span id="v.xviii-p90.1"></span> ..md)
We ought then to have <span class="c11"><span
id="v.xviii-p90.2"></span>God</span> always in remembrance, but then
especially, when thought is undisturbed, when by means of that
remembrance \[a man\] is able to condemn himself, when he can retain
\[things\] in memory. For in the daytime indeed, if we do remember,
other cares and troubles entering in, drive the thought out again: but
in the night it is possible to remember continually, when the soul is
calm and at rest; when it is in the haven, and under a serene sky. “The
things which you say in your hearts be ye grieved for on your beds,” he
says. ( [Ps. iv. 4](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#004.md) <span
id="v.xviii-p90.3"></span> , LXX.)  For it were indeed right to retain
this remembrance through the day also. But inasmuch as you are always
full of cares, and distracted amidst the things of this life, at least
then remember God on your bed; at the morning dawn meditate upon Him.

<span id="v.xviii-p91"></span> If at the morning dawn we meditate on
these things, we shall go forth to our business with much security. If
we have first made God propitious by prayer  <span
id="fr_3021"></span>[3022](#fn_3021.md) and supplication, going forth thus
we shall have no enemy. Or if thou shouldest, thou wilt laugh him to
scorn, having God propitious. There is war in the market place; the
affairs of every day are a fight, they are a tempest and a storm. We
therefore need arms: and prayer is a great weapon. We need favorable
winds; we need to learn everything, so as to go through the length of
the day without shipwrecks and without wounds. For every single day the
rocks are many, and oftentimes the boat strikes and is sunk. Therefore
have we especially need of prayer early and by night.

<span id="v.xviii-p93"></span> \[10.\] Many of you have often beheld the
Olympic games: and not only have beheld but have been zealous partisans
and admirers of the combatants, one of this \[combatant\], one of that.
You know then that both during the days of the contests, and during
those nights, all night long the herald  <span
id="fr_3022"></span>[3023](#fn_3022.md) thinks of nothing else, has no
other anxiety, than that the combatant should not disgrace himself when
he goes forth. For those who sit by the trumpeter admonish him not to
speak to any one, that he may not spend his breath and get laughed at.
If therefore he who is about to strive before men, uses such
forethought, much more will it befit us to be continually thoughtful,
and careful, since our whole life is a contest. Let every night then be
a vigil,  <span id="fr_3023"></span>[3024](#fn_3023.md) and let us be
careful that when we go out in the day we do not make ourselves
ridiculous. And would it were only making ourselves ridiculous. But now
the Judge of the contest is <span id="page_438">p. 438</span> <span
id="v.xviii-Page_438"></span> seated on the right hand of the Father,
hearkening diligently that we utter not any false note, anything out of
tune. For He is not the Judge of actions only, but of words also. Let us
keep our vigil,  <span id="fr_3024"></span>[3025](#fn_3024.md) beloved; we
also have those that are eager for our success, if we will. Near each
one of us Angels are sitting; and yet we snore through the whole night.
And would it were only this. But many do even many licentious things,
some indeed going to the very brothels,  <span
id="fr_3025"></span>[3026](#fn_3025.md) and others making their own houses
places of whoredom by taking courtesans thither. Yes most certainly. For
is it not so? They care well for their contest. Others are drunken and
speak amiss;  <span id="fr_3026"></span>[3027](#fn_3026.md) others make an
uproar. Others keep evil vigil through the night weaving, and worse than
those who sleep, schemes of deceit; others by calculating usury; others
by bruising themselves with cares, and doing anything rather than what
is suited to the contest. Wherefore, I exhort you, let us lay aside all
\[other\] things, and look to one only, how we may obtain the prize,
\[how we may\] be crowned with the Chaplet; let us do all by which we
shall be able to attain to the promised blessings. Which may we all
attain in Christ Jesus our Lord, with whom to the Father and also to the
Holy Ghost be glory, might, honor, now and for ever and world without
end. Amen.

house is said to be new, and (ii) according to his interpretation, as
the Heavens are new, when after long drought they again give rain. St.

of old, unfruitful. ii. That this interpretation of the</span> “ <span

usually follows, and the Latin versions of Mutianus and the later
translator, all give the text which is here translated: </span> <span

id="v.xviii-p45.11"></span>when it is no longer of brass, but gives
rain: \[and the earth in like manner is new,\] when it is not
unfruitful, not when it has been changed: \[and in this sense the house

class="Greek"><span id="v.xviii-p45.12"></span>&c. There does not
however appear to be any need for this: on the contrary, while the old
text is simple and intelligible, the additions bring in matters which
are out of place. \[The other Catena, however, that of Niketas,
Archbishop of Heraklea, one of Mr. Field’s valuable authorities, has the
bracketed bits.\]</span>

<span id="v.xviii-p46"></span> <span class="Greek"><span

class="Greek"><span id="v.xviii-p46.4"></span>apply naturally to the
heaven, when it does not supply the moisture necessary for producing
fruit. This argument from the</span> “ <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.xviii-p46.5"></span>new heaven</span> ” <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.xviii-p46.6"></span>is alleged by the objector as distinct from
that of the</span> “ <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.xviii-p46.7"></span>new house</span> ” <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.xviii-p46.8"></span>: it is an instance, he would say, of the
word</span> “ <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.xviii-p46.9"></span>new</span> ” <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.xviii-p46.10"></span>being applied, when there was neither change
nor substitution, as St. Chrys. interprets the prophecy: nor even
partial alteration as in the analogy of the</span> “ <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.xviii-p46.11"></span>new house</span> ” <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.xviii-p46.12"></span>; but only a renewal of
fertilizing action which had been previously suspended.</span>

<span id="v.xviii-p47"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.xviii-p47.1"></span>On the other hand the introduction of</span> “
<span class="Greek"><span id="v.xviii-p47.2"></span>the new earth</span>
” <span class="Greek"><span id="v.xviii-p47.3"></span>by the
interpolator is out of place: inasmuch as unfruitful ground would
represent the people not the Law; neither does St. Chrys. in the

better to follow in the translation Field’s text than to follow the
alterations of the English edition—both because the passage is thus much
clearer, and because this is professedly a translation of Field’s text,
and his critical sagacity must be considered on such a point of higher
value.—F.G.\]</span>

neither reading gives a suitable meaning. If the reading adopted by Mr.
F. and followed in the translation be the true one, it must be supposed
that St. Chrys. had in mind the condition in which Ezra, or perhaps
Nehemiah, found the Jews. The words</span> <span class="Greek"><span

Nehemiah than to Ezra: and the reception of Nehemiah on his second visit
to Jerusalem may have been the circumstance of which the orator was
thinking.</span>
